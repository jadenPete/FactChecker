the
trump
administration
has
told
park
superintendents
around
the
country
they
must
notify
washington
supervisors
before
issuing
comments
to
other
parts
of
the
federal
government
when
they
are
worried
about
drilling
and
other
proposed
developments
near
national
parks
in
an
aug
memo
obtained
by
the
washington
post
david
vela
the
national
park
service's
acting
deputy
director
told
field
offices
they
need
to
notify
headquarters
in
washington
if
they
want
to
submit
comments
to
other
agencies
considering
proposals
on
a
broad
swath
of
issues
former
park
officials
and
park
advocacy
organizations
who
reviewed
the
memo
criticized
it
as
an
effort
to
rein
in
regional
officials
who
may
object
to
development
such
as
the
erection
of
oil
rigs
or
cellular
towers
near
national
parks
potentially
hampering
the
experience
of
parkgoers
certainly
it
seems
to
be
a
pretty
big
change
from
the
days
i
spent
my
years
in
the
national
park
service

phil
francis

has
served
as
the
top

is
now
chair
of
the
coalition
to
protect
america's
national
parks
an
advocacy
group
jeremy
barnum
a
park
service
spokesman
countered
that
the
guidance
memo
is
simply
clarifying
existing
policy
and
does
not
make
any
substantial
changes
to
how
park
officials
share
information
with
other
parts
of
the
federal
bureaucracy
this
is
not
anything
new
barnum
wrote
by
email
the
memo
was
sent
to
provide
common
sense
guidance
to
national
park
service
managers
on
how
best
to
provide
consistent
productive
and
timely
engagement
in
other
agencies
proposals
and
projects
that
may
affect
parks
and
the
visitor
experience
the
guidance
may
make
it
easier
to
allow
development
on
government
land
adjacent
to
national
parks
which
are
meant
to
give
visitors
a
reprieve
from
the
grind
of
modern
life
despite
the
fact
that
civilization
often
lurks
at
parks
edges
many
national
parks
abut
federally
controlled
areas
that
could
be
used
for
oil
drilling
or
cattle
grazing
which
are
often
administered
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
both
the
blm
and
nps
are
agencies
in
the
department
of
the
interior
but
a
park
can
lose
some
of
its
wild
luster
with
cell
towers
looming
in
view
or
oil
drillers
obstructing
migrating
animals
trying
to
make
their
way
to
the
park
that
has
led
park
superintendents
to
offer
written
feedback
on
proposals
outside
park
service
borders
in
for
example
local
park
officials
in
utah
asked
blm
to
hold
off
on
leasing
acres
of
public
land
for
drilling
staffers
were
concerned
about
how
dust
and
smog
from
the
oil
and
gas
activity
could
worsen
air
quality
and
obscure
the
night
sky
across
the
canyon-cut
parklands
in
southern
utah
and
southwestern
colorado
the
visiting
public
expects
high-quality
experiences
across
federal
land
and
we
are
concerned
that
continuing
to
offer
parcels
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
development
in
proximity
to
our
parks
will
be
detrimental

went
ahead
with
the

anyway
further
north
the
outcome
was
different
near

monument
a
fossil-filled
wilderness
at
the
utah-colorado

a
proposed

its
superintendent

as

as

lease
sale
natalie
levine
program
manager
for
government
affairs
at
the
national
parks
conservation
association
suggested
that
kind
of
candid
communication
available
for
all
to
read
on
blm's
website
may
now
no
longer
be
made
public
under
the
new
guidance
this
is
limiting
the
public's
ability
to
see
and
hear
what
the
park
service
might
be
concerned
about
she
said
according
to
vela's
memo
parks
must
submit
weekly
reports
notifying
headquarters
if
they
plan
to
file
official
comments
on
any
projects
that
relate
to
doi
priorities
ideally
giving
washington
officials
at
least
three
weeks
notice
before
submitting
them
to
other
agencies
those
priorities
include
leasing
for
oil
and
gas
building
hiking
trails
maintaining
wildlife
migration
routes
and
constructing
power
lines
and
cell
towers
vela
said
that
park
superintendents
should
be
prepared
to
provide
headquarters
with
drafts
of
the
comments
if
needed
he
reassured
park
workers
that
w
e
continue
to
rely
heavily
on
the
expertise
and
professional
judgment
of
parks
nps
spokesman
barnum
noted
that
past
administrations
have
sought
to
make
sure
comments
filed
by
field
offices
are
in
line
with
departmentwide
priorities
as
has
been
the
case
in
any
administration
washington
may
ask
parks
to
provide
the
comments
they
are
preparing
should
washington
determine
that
senior
level
awareness
and
coordination
are
needed
he
said
that
is
not
anything
new
francis

of
the

from
to
said
he
did
not
need
guidance
from
washington
higher-ups
when
submitting
comments
he
remembers
writing
to
the
u.s.
forest
service
with
his
concerns
about
clear-cutting
trees
near
his
park
which
runs
for
nearly
miles
through
virginia
and
north
carolina
it
makes
me
wonder
what
the
motive
really
is

trump
vs

the
fight
between
the
president
and
the
most
populous
state
seems
to
have
gotten
worse
since
news
broke
the
trump
administration
intends
to
end
california's
right
to
set
auto
pollution
standards
stepping
back
the
administration's
latest
move
sets
up
a
potential
clash
over
the
state's
long-standing
ability
to
set
its
own
more
stringent
standards
for
tailpipe
emissions
and
fuel
efficiency
a
power
the
courts
have
upheld
for
the
past
half-century
the
post's
juliet
eilperin
and
brady
dennis
report
the
president's
statements
echoed
the
administration's
pitch
that
the
change
would
lower
vehicle
sticker
prices
driving
americans
to
buy
newer
safer
cars
but
the
trump
team
has
acknowledged
easing
fuel-efficiency
standards
will
increase
fuel
consumption
by
roughly
a
half-million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
an
increase
of
to
percent
and
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
greenhouse-gas
emissions
