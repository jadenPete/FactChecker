barack
obama
appeared
to
lob
a
thinly
veiled
jab
at
his
replacement
in
the
white
house
at
a
technology
event
here
wednesday
marking
a
rare
public
rebuke
from
the
former
president
speaking
at
a
private
event
hosted
by
data
company
splunk
obama
explained
how
he
had
approached
the
job
including
some
political
appointments
before
offering
this
advice
the
other
thing
that
is
helpful
is
not
watching
tv
or
reading
social
media
those
are
two
things
i
would
advise
if
you're
our
president
not
to
do
he
said
it
creates
a
lot
of
noise
and
clouds
your
judgment
barack
obama
shares
op-ed
criticizing
president
trump's
poisoning
of
our
democracy
president
trump
is
of
course
frequently
on
twitter
and
has
been
known
to
watch
hours
of
cable
news
daily
in
the
roughly
one-hour
fireside
chat
obama
never
directly
referred
to
trump
or
his
administration
but
that
comment
along
with
another
highlighting
that
the
obama
administration
avoided
any
indictments
seemed
tailored
to
the
largely
liberal
san
francisco
audience
i'm
proud
of
the
fact
we
didn't
have
indictments
during
his
two
terms
in
office
he
said
i've
said
that
before
but
that
is
pretty
rare
in
modern
day
trump's
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
the
fbi
about
contacts
with
a
russian
ambassador
related
to
the
investigation
into
russian
interference
in
the
presidential
election
former
trump
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
was
convicted
of
tax-
and
bank-fraud
charges
obama
has
seldom
weighed
in
on
current
politics
since
leaving
office
in
former
presidents
typically
refrain
from
criticizing
successors
out
of
tradition
even
if
they
are
from
different
political
parties
this
summer
obama
shared
in
a
tweet
a
link
to
an
op-ed
that
criticized
trump
for
comments
he
had
made
regarding
four
congresswomen
of
color
seeming
to
endorse
it
trump
accuses
fox
news
of
heavily
promoting
the
democrats
urges
followers
to
look
for
another
news
outlet
on
wednesday
obama
cautioned
against
what
he
called
opinion
wrapped
up
as
fact
too
much
focus
on
polls
or
the
intensity
of
the
passion
of
a
very
small
subset
of
people
he
said
will
sway
your
decision-making
in
an
unhealthy
way
the
former
president
singled
out
climate
change
political
divisions
globally
and
income
inequality
as
three
major
issues
that
could
cause
significant
problems
if
they're
not
addressed
properly
obama
otherwise
largely
steered
clear
of
any
commentary
on
washington
he
spoke
at
length
about
parenting
noting
he
had
wept
after
dropping
off
his
daughters
at
college
