democrats
impeachment
debut
leaves
more
questions
than
answers
democrats
are
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
trump
and
their
debut
tuesday
with
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
left
more
questions
than
answers
about
how
they're
going
to
do
this
lewandowski
was
resolute
in
his
efforts
to
protect
trump
from
the
re-airing
of
the
details
of
the
mueller
report
democratic
lawmakers
on
the
judiciary
committee
didn't
have
a
way
around
his
stonewalling
to
elicit
new
or
even
particularly
useful
information
as
they
decide
whether
to
impeach
trump
a
practiced
lawyer
for
the
committee
did
manage
to
get
lewandowski
to
say
under
oath
that
the
president
asked
him
to
tell
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
limit
the
special
counsel's
probe
but
that
confirmed
what
the
mueller
report
already
said
lewandowski's
performance
was
not
unique
to
him
he
like
most
others
in
trump's
orbit
is
equally
resolute
in
his
efforts
to
block
democrats
in
congress
from
moving
anything
forward
with
regard
to
investigating
trump
lewandowski
is
the
only
person
with
a
star
role
in
the
mueller
report
out
of
nearly
half
a
dozen
subpoenaed
people
under
this
impeachment
inquiry
to
even
agree
to
testify
on
monday
the
white
house
blocked
testimony
from
two
more
former
officials
who
are
key
players
in
the
mueller
report's
section
on
whether
trump
obstructed
justice
these
officials
don't
work
for
trump
anymore
but
they
are
still
sticking
by
him
former
white
house
counsel
donald
mcgahn
would
rather
get
sued
by
democrats
which
he
is
than
testify
against
trump
house
judiciary
chairman
jerrold
e.
nadler
d-n
y.
could
hold
lewandowski
or
any
of
these
other
folks
in
contempt
of
congress
but
that
matters
little
when
being
in
contempt
of
congress
is
part
of
their
strategy
to
protect
trump
contrast
the
display
of
unity
on
trump's
side
with
how
democrats
in
the
house
are
divided
about
whether
to
even
pursue
an
impeachment
inquiry
on
tuesday
what
some
democrats
had
been
whispering
about
all
summer
finally
broke
out
into
the
open
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
thinks
the
judiciary
committee
has
gone
too
far
in
its
impeachment
efforts
because
democrats
don't
have
the
votes
on
the
floor
to
impeach
him
feel
free
to
leak
this
pelosi
said
according
to
politico
which
reported
the
drama
wednesday
pelosi
has
also
been
saying
for
months
that
there
just
isn't
the
public
sentiment
for
impeachment
right
now
polling
shows
she's
right
in
august
monmouth
university
found
that
a
majority
of
americans
think
it's
a
bad
idea
to
conduct
an
inquiry
that
may
lead
to
trump's
impeachment
now
that
they're
officially
doing
an
impeachment
inquiry
democrats
running
the
impeachment
inquiry
don't
seem
to
have
a
coherent
strategy
for
how
to
win
people
over
many
democrats
were
hoping
that
special
counsel
robert
s.
mueller
iii's
testimony
this
summer
where
he
read
some
of
the
damaging
things
his
report
uncovered
about
trump
out
loud
would
be
that
strategy
it
didn't
move
the
public
opinion
dial
significantly
part
of
the
problem
for
democrats
is
that
republicans
messaging
is
just
simpler
impeachment
inquiry
overreach
of
government
i
think
they
hate
this
president
more
than
they
love
their
country
lewandowski
said
of
democrats
at
the
hearing
stop
worrying
about
tearing
down
the
president
said
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-calif
on
wednesday
and
start
working
on
building
up
this
country
democrats
have
rather
messy
messaging
on
what
they're
doing
derived
from
disagreement
on
whether
to
even
do
it
last
week
pelosi
wouldn't
even
say
impeachment
inquiry
to
describe
the
very-real
impeachment
inquiry
the
judiciary
committee
is
undertaking
even
if
democrats
were
all
in
agreement
that
an
impeachment
inquiry
is
the
right
way
forward
that's
a
much
more
delicate
thing
to
broadcast
to
the
american
people
before
you
write
up
articles
of
impeachment
you
have
an
inquiry
to
decide
what
those
articles
are
so
while
democrats
follow
the
somewhat
nuanced
steps
as
outlined
in
the
constitution
trump
is
blasting
through
the
rules
to
block
them
and
he
has
plenty
of
help
in
the
form
of
people
like
lewandowski
trump's
stonewalling
for
now
it
seems
has
effectively
stymied
democrats
impeachment
inquiry
and
after
the
lewandowski
hearing
it's
not
immediately
clear
how
they're
going
to
proceed
next
