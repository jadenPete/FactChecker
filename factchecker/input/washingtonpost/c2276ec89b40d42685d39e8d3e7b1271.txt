the
trailer
going
negative
doesn't
seem
to
be
working
for
democrats
in
this
edition
why
no
democrat
can
afford
to
go
negative
the
conservative
vaping
panic
and
the
steak
fry
ticket
primary
i
picked
the
wrong
political
weekend
to
stop
eating
red
meat
and
this
is
the
trailer
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
at
the
sept
debate
in
houston
mike
blake
reuters
philadelphia
when
he
took
the
stage
at
a
labor
policy
summit
here
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
told
workers
what
he
had
never
done
he
had
never
supported
nafta
he
had
never
supported
the
iraq
war
unlike
joe
biden
who
had
spoken
hours
earlier
to
a
much
quieter
reception
sanders
had
gotten
the
big
things
right
when
it
comes
to
working
people
i
have
a
record
that
i
don't
need
to
apologize
for
sanders
told
reporters
after
the
speech
at
the
same
time
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
was
taping
an
interview
with
late-night
host
stephen
colbert
who
asked
her
why
she
kept
warning
audiences
against
a
candidate
they
didn't
believe
in
asked
whether
she
was
talking
about
joe
biden
warren
quickly
said
no
then
pivoted
to
talk
about
the
scary
times
trump
had
brought
to
america
until
her
friendly
misdirected
audience
began
to
cheer
the
difference
in
how
warren
and
sanders
talk
about
former
vice
president
biden
demonstrated
one
of
the
primary's
biggest
quandaries
candidates
need
to
make
contrasts
with
their
strongest
rivals
but
democratic
voters
don't
want
to
hear
the
candidates
go
negative
so
far
no
candidate
has
managed
to
build
support
after
making
a
sharp
attack
on
another
candidate
even
when
that
attack
is
true
i
suspect
folks
would
like
to
think
any
one
or
all
of
our
candidates
is
better
than
the
current
occupant
of
the
white
house
said
former
agriculture
secretary
tom
vilsack
who
is
neutral
in
the
primary
so
far
i
do
think
that
elections
are
often
responses
to
the
previous
election
and
many
may
have
felt
we
crippled
our
nominee
in
with
attacks
that
led
to
the
trump
win
there
is
no
desire
for
a
repeat
of
that
the
election
which
rattled
countless
theories
about
politics
did
some
damage
to
the
popular
thinking
on
negative
campaigning
democrats
watched
first
with
delight
then
terror
as
a
series
of
republicans
self-immolated
by
thinking
they
could
break
out
with
attacks
on
donald
trump
and
democrats
did
not
think
their
long
primary
between
sanders
and
hillary
clinton
which
only
occasionally
got
personal
would
cause
long-term
political
nerve
damage
when
it
did
it
left
the
democratic
electorate
more
cautious
than
ever
about
candidates
who
went
on
the
attack
that
attitude
generally
has
benefited
biden
who
has
remained
atop
most
polls
despite
a
string
of
gaffes
from
a
flip-flop
on
the
antiabortion
hyde
amendment
to
a
confusing
debate
moment
that
turned
a
question
about
the
legacy
of
slavery
into
a
riff
on
playing
records
to
increase
children's
vocabularies
no
candidate
has
improved
his
or
her
position
by
attacking
biden
or
questioning
his
quickness
as
a
candidate
rep
eric
swalwell
of
california
and
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
of
new
york
tried
to
grind
biden
down
but
for
both
that
turned
out
to
be
their
final
appearances
in
televised
debates
after
rep
tim
ryan
of
ohio
told
a
bloomberg
news
reporter
that
biden
was
declining
he
moderated
that
tone
in
front
of
new
hampshire
tv
cameras
a
few
days
later
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
more
dramatically
dominated
a
june
debate
exchange
with
biden
over
his
old
collaboration
with
segregationist
senators
earning
a
second
look
from
democratic
voters
one
month
later
harris
gave
an
unsteady
debate
performance
and
was
slow
to
respond
to
a
surprise
attack
from
rep
tulsi
gabbard
d-hawaii
who
unloaded
on
the
californian
for
her
career
as
a
prosecutor
and
state
attorney
general
when
you
were
in
a
position
to
make
a
difference
and
an
impact
in
these
people's
lives
you
did
not
gabbard
said
harris
began
falling
in
polls
gabbard
stayed
in
the
low
single
digits
at
the
next
debate
when
former
hud
secretary
juli
n
castro
accused
joe
biden
of
forgetting
his
own
health-care
plan
rival
candidates
mostly
criticized
castro
for
daring
to
go
low
go
look
back
at
some
of
the
democratic
debates
of
the
past
said
castro's
brother
rep
joaquin
castro
d-tex
who
argued
that
previous
democratic
debates
had
been
far
more
brutal
go
look
at
that
debate
between
bill
clinton
and
jerry
brown
democrats
in
this
cycle
have
been
aboveboard
the
debate
in
question
turned
ugly
when
brown
attacked
hillary
clinton's
ethics
and
her
husband
said
that
brown
wasn't
fit
to
mention
his
wife's
name
polling
which
has
only
now
started
to
absorb
the
effects
of
the
candidates
attack
lines
has
found
no
benefit
at
all
to
going
negative
a
new
poll
from
david
binder
research
conducted
in
iowa
after
the
debate
found
that
percent
of
likely
caucusgoers
had
ruled
out
castro
while
percent
had
ruled
out
sanders
and
percent
had
ruled
out
harris
since
the
last
poll
in
july
both
castro
and
harris
had
seen
the
number
of
iowa
democrats
holding
a
positive
opinion
of
them
fall
by
double
digits
gabbard
and
john
delaney
the
former
maryland
congressman
who
had
used
two
debates
to
attack
medicare-for-all
stayed
flat
and
far
behind
i
think
i
was
able
to
walk
the
line
but
it's
a
very
fine
line
delaney
said
of
his
debate
performances
the
democratic
party
correctly
understands
that
we
have
to
be
unified
to
beat
trump
i'd
describe
our
voters
as
having
zero
tolerance
for
negativity
the
biggest
beneficiary
of
every
attack
has
been
the
candidate
not
making
any
of
them
warren
the
same
iowa
poll
found
percent
of
voters
viewing
warren
positively
and
just
percent
ruling
her
out
the
lowest
number
for
any
democrat
warren's
absolute
refusal
to
go
negative
the
closest
she
came
was
in
characterizing
delaney's
attacks
as
republican
talking
points
was
a
choice
made
easier
by
the
reluctance
of
other
candidates
to
believe
she
could
become
a
strong
competitor
in
the
past
week
they've
begun
playing
catch-up
albeit
in
a
way
that
shows
how
nervous
they
are
about
alienating
democratic
voters
and
so
at
a
houston
fundraiser
biden
took
a
few
swipes
that
he
didn't
take
on
the
debate
stage
saying
the
country
needed
more
than
plans
and
that
half
the
people
on
the
debate
stage
were
former
republicans
a
line
that
applies
to
only
warren
in
a
strategy
call
with
reporters
harris
campaign
spokesman
lily
adams
noted
that
the
californian
didn't
come
in
with
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
raised
in
an
attempt
to
raise
awareness
that
warren
held
traditional
high-dollar
fundraisers
for
her
layup
senate
reelection
bid
before
making
a
pledge
not
to
hold
similar
fundraisers
in
the
presidential
primary
other
campaigns
have
tried
subtly
to
advance
a
negative
story
line
about
warren
without
attacking
her
directly
there's
widespread
frustration
among
them
that
stories
about
warren's
corporate
law
work
published
in
the
washington
post
and
elsewhere
have
not
commanded
a
news
cycle
surrogates
for
other
candidates
have
hinted
that
warren's
past
claims
of
native
american
ancestry
could
be
a
problem
for
her
but
no
candidate
has
ever
said
so
directly
sanders
the
only
candidate
positioned
to
criticize
warren
from
the
left
has
refused
to
do
so
but
he
has
been
game
about
attacking
biden
in
philadelphia
he
made
a
line-by-line
case
against
the
former
vice
president
to
warn
that
he
would
struggle
on
the
same
issues
donald
trump
used
to
separate
democratic
voters
from
hillary
clinton
not
only
did
i
vote
against
nafta
and
permanent
trade
relations
with
china
i
helped
lead
the
opposition
to
them
sanders
said
joe
voted
for
both
of
those
agreements
i
helped
lead
the
opposition
against
a
disastrous
war
in
iraq
joe
voted
for
that
war
i
did
not
vote
to
bail
out
the
crooks
on
wall
street
joe
did
so
not
only
is
there
a
difference
in
terms
of
our
vision
for
americans
there
is
a
very
strong
difference
in
terms
of
our
records
other
candidates
have
begun
to
lay
off
biden
in
june
beto
o'rourke
took
an
msbnc
interviewer's
cue
and
said
that
biden
represented
the
past
of
division
and
defeat
this
country
should
be
able
to
do
far
better
o'rourke
said
the
texan
gained
nothing
from
that

and
didn't
repeat
it
onstage
at
the
june
debate
three
months
later
pushed
by

the

to
ban

cartridges
earned
a
quick
round
of
derision
from

who
scoffed
at

health
crises
a

of
vape-related
deaths
compared
with
tens
of
thousands
of
annual
deaths
connected

but
the
opposition
that
might
be
more
relevant
to
the
president's
support
comes
from
the
right
especially
the
libertarian
right
which
was
all-in
for
vaping
before
trump
became
a
candidate
trump's
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
has
personally
been
responding
to
some
of
the
worries
on
twitter
where
fans
of
the
president
have
been
in
disbelief
that
he
would
regulate
and
eliminate
their
hobby
he
just
tweeted
about
this
parscale
responded
to
one
trump
supporter
begging
the
president
to
back
down
he
stated
he
likes
vaping
as
an
alternative
to
smoking
just
wants

we

grover
norquist
the
president
of
americans
for
tax
reform
was
leading
the
charge
to
persuade
republicans
to
not
become
a
vape-skeptic
party
in
when
republican
sen
ron
johnson
of
wisconsin
won
a
second
term
in
an
upset
he
credited
the
vaping
vote
marking
the
first

people
had
heard
the

wasn't
surprised

was

tour
in

urging
the

of

who
would
refuse

organized
for
johnson
norquist
recalled
we
did
a
nine-state
bus
tour
in
support
of
anti-prohibitionist
senators
some
even
democrats
the
key
is
to
remind
the
campaigns
and
candidates
that
this
is
a
vote-moving
issue
people
who
view
themselves
as
saving
their
lives
are
seriously
pissed
at
prohibitionists
who
would
force
them
back
to
tobacco
flavors
tobacco
cigarettes
according
to
atr's
paul
blair
who
summed
up
his
research
in
a
column
last
week
the
conservative
group
determined
that
four
in
five
vapers
could
be
moved
to
vote
for
a
candidate
if
they
took
the
right
position
on
vaping
norquist
and
atr
which
have
operated
for
years
as
a
sort
of
nerve
center
for
conservative
organizing
and
lobbying
have
been
contacting
allies
to
explain
why
any
new
regulations
would
lose
votes
trump
won
michigan
by
under
votes
in
where
there
are
adult
vapers
blair
wrote
these
staggering
numbers
play
out
in
florida
where
trump
won
by
votes
with
over
vapers
wisconsin
where
trump
won
by
votes
with
at
least
vapers
minnesota
where
clinton
won
by
votes
over
vapers
and
pennsylvania
where
trump
won
by
votes
over
vapers
it's
not
hard
to
see
how
this
well-organized
vaping
constituency
could
swing
the
outcome
of
the
electoral
college
one
way
or
the
other
the
electoral
math
was
easy
norquist
said
it
is
a
fight
between
a

the
electability
debate
among
democrats
has
turned
on

different
things
in
their
televised
debates
the
most
common
point
of
contention
and
accusations
that
one
candidate
would
throw
the
election
is
replacing
all
private
health
insurance
with
a

fox's
poll
is
the
latest
to
find
that
while
single-payer
advocates
are
wrong
to
insist
the
plan
is
wildly
popular
it's
not
toxic
only
a
slight
plurality
of
voters
oppose
it
before
any
arguments
are
made
about

caveat
is
that
there's
nothing

will
head
to
des
moines's
water
works
park
for
the
polk
county
democratic
steak
fry
which
has
grown
into
a
full-scale
replacement
for
a
gathering
once
hosted
by
sen
tom
harkin
tickets
cost
and
more
than
tickets
have
been
snapped
up
by
the
presidential
campaigns
strategic
purchases
that
tell
us
a
lot
about
how
the
campaigns
view
iowa
according
to
the
county
democrats
the
biggest
block
of
tickets
went
to
joe
biden's
campaign
which
purchased
of
them
next
was
pete
buttigieg
with
and
kamala
harris
with
no
other
democrat
broke
into
four
digits
elizabeth

campaign
grabbed
tickets
cory

bet
heavily
on
iowa
purchased
tickets
three
very
different
campaigns
bought
tickets
each
bernie
sanders
steve
bullock
and
juli
n
castro
while
the
latter
two
have
been
mired
at
percent
in
iowa
they
look
at
a
strong
showing
in
the
state
as
their
best
way
to
break
the
race
open
sanders
who
has
the
largest
volunteer
network
prefers
not
to
take
part
in
visibility
type
events
that
simply
show
off
staff
size
tom
steyer
purchased
tickets
michael
bennet
purchased
andrew
yang
purchased
and
tulsi
gabbard
nabbed
just
before
the
deadline
passed
last
week
bernie
sanders
his
campaign
reached
million
individual
donors
the
first
operation
to
do
so
other
campaigns
will
release
their
donor
info
early
next
month
bernie
sanders
is
the
only
candidate
who
is
able
to
say
his
campaign
will
rely
only
on
grass-roots
funding
in
both
the
primary
and
against
donald
trump
said
sanders
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
which
could
be
read
as
a
subtle
reference
to
elizabeth
warren
she
has
sworn
off
high-dollar
fundraisers
through
the
primary
while
remaining
open
to
them
if
she
becomes
the
nominee
kamala
harris
she
announced
plans
to
double
her
staff
presence
in
iowa
and
campaign
intensively
across
a
state
she
had
not
visited
since
an
early
august
trip
around
the
iowa
state
fair
joe
biden
he
picked
up
the
endorsements
of
rep
emanuel
cleaver
ii
of
missouri
rep
g.k.
butterfield
of
north
carolina
and
rep
charlie
crist
of
florida
biden
is
still
well
behind
hillary
clinton's
campaign
in
congressional
support
but
he
has
an
advantage
that
she
didn't
scared
democrats
who
worry
that
a
more
liberal
candidate
would
lose
the
general
election
warren
and
sanders
cannot
win
north
carolina
butterfield
told
the
associated
press
beto
o'rourke
long
a
supporter
of
legalizing
and
taxing
marijuana
he
added
a
plan
to
release
nonviolent
drug
offenders
from
prison
and
give
drug
war
justice
grants
to
people
who
want
to
enter
a
new
legal
industry
after
being
punished
for
illegal
selling
he
also
participated
in
a
reddit
ama
where
he
was
occasionally
deluged
by
requests
to
run
for
senate
again
steve
bullock
his
visit
to
the
iowa
steak
fry
will
per
his
campaign
show
off
grilling
techniques
honed
in
montana
amy
klobuchar
she
continued
her
blue
wall
tour
on
thursday
telling
a
michigan
audience
that
some
unnamed
candidates
had
policies
better
left
in
the
faculty
lounge
warren
is
a
former
college
professor
pete
buttigieg
he
has
upped
the
emphasis
on
his
hybrid
medicare
plan
that
would
let
americans
buy
into
the
program
buying
facebook
ads
that
contrast
it
with
the
warren-sanders
vision
by
saying
he
would
prefer
to
trust
americans
on
their
plans
the
saga
of
the
working
families
party's
endorsement
is
not
over
the
liberal
group
vote's
vote
for
elizabeth
warren
over
bernie
sanders
and
three
other
candidates
who
had
made
the
cut
inspired
waves
of
criticism
in
left-wing
media
so
much
so
that
the
wfp
expanded
on
its
decision
in
a
thursday
morning
medium
post
the
biggest
change
to
the
process
from
four
years
ago
is
that
this
year
we
substantially
increased
the
voting
power
of
online
supporters
and
individual
members
from
just
one-eighth
to
a
full
half
of
the
total
vote
share
balancing
it
equally
with
the
national
committee
delegates
wrote
the
wfp's
maurice
mitchell
and
nelini
stamp
in
when
sanders
won
the
wfp's
endorsement
it
was
with
percent
of
the
party's
voting
members
and
over
the
objections
of
some
powerful
leaders
of
its
national
committee
the
post
did
not
name
any
particular
criticism
of
the
endorsement
but
there
had
been
many
including
studies
purporting
to
prove
that
national
leaders
overruled
grass-roots
members
and
a
tweet
from
green
party
presidential
nominee
jill
stein
accusing
the
party
of
using
superdelegates
to
cancel
out
votes
over
the
last
few
days
the
activists
and
leaders
who
make
up
wfp's
state
committees
or
represent
them
on
the
national
committee
have
been
maligned
as
so-called
superdelegates
or
worse
mitchell
and
stamp
wrote
but
they're
actually
more
like
regular
delegates
in
any
political
party
they
are
the
people
selected
to
carry
the
votes
of
the
bodies
or
constituencies
they
represent
they
are
a
beautiful
mix
of
working
people
of
every
experience
and
every
race
who
come
together
to
struggle
to
build
and
win
a
common
political
agenda
what
happened
according
to
wfp
insiders
who
spoke
to
reporter
daniel
marans
is
probably
that
sanders
got
outworked
while
both
he
and
warren
participated
in
a
live-streamed
interview
with
mitchell
warren
participated
in
a
follow-up
conference
call
with
wfp
leaders
sanders
did
not
warren
endorsed
two
wfp
candidates
in
philadelphia
and
west
virginia
sanders
didn't
and
some
key
leaders
came
to
believe
that
warren
had
the
potential
to
build
a
stronger
coalition
in
a
democratic
primary
than
sanders
did
i
really
feel
that
elizabeth
warren
would
have
a
better
shot
at
unifying
the
left
and
the
center
we
can't
just
think
we're
going
to
go
as
far
left
as
we
can
and
bring
the
center
along
with
us
wfp
organizer
sandra
cuellar
oxford
told
marans
i
feel
that
elizabeth
has
been
somewhat
more
conciliatory
and
offered
a
larger
tent
to
those
who
definitely
won't
vote
for
bernie
the
arguments
over
the
endorsement
aren't
over
as
supporters
of
the
wfp's
decision
and
sanders
campaigners
clash
online
over
who
is
responsible
for
the
most
egregious
attacks
on
the
other
camp
one
day
until
the
one
iowa
lgbtq
forum
in
cedar
rapids
two
days
until
the
polk
county
democratic
steak
fry
in
des
moines
three
days
until
the
youth
voice
forum
in
des
moines
days
until
the
end
of
the
third
fundraising
quarter
