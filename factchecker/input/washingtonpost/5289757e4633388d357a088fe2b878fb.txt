miss
the
key
with
a
new
official
set
to
take
the
reins
of
the
trump
white
house's
national
security
strategy
some
democratic
lawmakers
are
pushing
for
cybersecurity
to
get
more
top-level
attention
just
hours
after
president
trump
named
former
hostage
negotiator
robert
c.
o'brien
as
his
new
national
security
adviser
house
homeland
security
committee
chairman
bennie
g.
thompson
d-miss
and
sen
mark
warner
d-va
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
both
called
on
o'brien
to
reinstate
the
white
house
cybersecurity
coordinator
role
eliminated
by
o'brien's
predecessor
john
bolton
an
aide
for
sen
gary
peters
mich
the
ranking
democrat
on
the
senate
homeland
security
committee
told
me
he
also
supports
restoring
the
position
by
eliminating
the
cybersecurity
coordinator's
job
while
the
government
is
struggling
to
repel
russian
efforts
to
hack
the
election
chinese
theft
of
american
companies
intellectual
property
and
a
surge
in
private-sector
data
breaches
bolton
and
trump
left
the
nation
dangerously
underprotected
the
lawmakers
said
one
of
the
worst
decisions
mr
bolton
made
right
when
he
started
in
the
white
house
was
to
get
rid
of
the
cyber
coordinator
position
warner
said
in
a
statement
it
showed
a
lack
of
seriousness
in
tackling
the
immediate
national
security
threats
facing
our
country
and
would
be
one
of
the
first
decisions
i
would
recommend
ambassador
o'brien
reverse
thompson
said
that
with
cyber
threats
becoming
more
sophisticated
and
growing
by
the
day
including
the
persistent
threat
to
our
election
systems
there
is
no
reason
that
the
white
house
should
have
allowed
this
position
to
be
eliminated
bolton's
stated
reason
for
eliminating
the
job
in
may
was
that
it
duplicated
work
already
being
done
by
policy
wonks
on
the
national
security
council
but
critics
said
that
vastly
underestimated
how
important
cybersecurity
is
to
multiple
parts
of
the
government
within
months
of
bolton's
actions
lawmakers
had
launched
multiple
efforts
to
force
trump
to
reinstate
the
job
as
a
result
of
eliminating
the
job
bolton
was
able
to
largely
run
white
house
cybersecurity
policy
himself
including
pushing
a
strategy
to
more
consistently
hack
back
against
u.s.
adversaries
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
on
o'brien's
plans
for
the
white
house
job
and
o'brien's
law
firm
didn't
respond
to
a
message
seeking
comment
the
cybersecurity
coordinator
job
which
was
occupied
until
last
year
by
top
nsa
cybersecurity
official
rob
joyce
was
responsible
for
guiding
the
government's
response
to
major
cybersecurity
events
such
as
russia's
hacking
of
the
democratic
national
committee
in
north
korea's
hack
of
sony
pictures
entertainment
and
the
wannacry
and
notpetya
malware
attacks
which
crippled
computers
around
the
globe
the
coordinator
also
helped
manage
conflicting
cybersecurity
priorities
within
the
government
for
example
by
ensuring
that
offensive
hacking
done
by
the
defense
department
and
intelligence
community
wasn't
prompting
unnecessary
retaliation
by
adversaries
against
u.s.
businesses
or
unduly
interfering
with
the
state
department's
diplomatic
efforts
what
you
want
the
cybersecurity
coordinator
to
do
is
synthesize
different
viewpoints
for
the
president
and
other
senior
leaders
in
the
white
house
so
that
you
can
forge
good
policy
that
blends
all
of
those
different
viewpoints
michael
daniel
who
served
as
white
house
cybersecurity
coordinator
during
the
obama
administration
told
me
daniel
who
leads
the
nonprofit
cyber
threat
alliance
noted
the
white
house
charges
a
similar
official
the
homeland
security
adviser
with
leading
high-level
policy
countering
terrorism
and
biological
threats
cyber
threats
are
out
there
and
have
been
if
not
the
number
one
threat
then
certainly
in
the
top
five
for
a
very
long
time
now
daniel
said
so
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
have
somebody
on
the
national
security
council
in
a
senior
position
that
has
some
profile
to
focus
on
this
on
this
issue
former
federal
chief
information
security
officer
and
retired
brig
gen
gregory
touhill
compared
the
job
to
someone
who
takes
blurry
and
incomplete
images
from
different
federal
departments
and
turns
them
into
one
clear
picture
that
the
government
can
act
on
having
that
coordinator
who
can
look
at
all
the
different
pixels
and
make
sure
that
the
picture
is
coming
into
sharp
focus
is
critically
important

wyden

taken

so
far
no

have
responded

beefed
up
its

since
russian

pilfered

released

emails
from

before

including
introducing
its

do
i
trust
