been
heavily
campaigning
there
have
been
few
public
polls
of

more
than
percentage
points
ahead

ruled
out
running

ticket

weld
said
she
sure
is
smart
and
she
sure
is
filled
with
energy

her
economic
policies
are
too
far
left
for

country
and
predicted
she
would
lose
in
a
general
election
weld
sounded
more
impressed
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
is
atop
most
of
the
democratic
polls
i've
known
biden
the
longest
of
any
of
these
folks
