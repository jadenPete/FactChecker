a
house
panel
is
considering
holding
corey
lewandowski
in
contempt
or
taking
other
steps
against
president
trump's
former
campaign
manager
hours
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
insistence
that
she
would
have
held
him
in
contempt
right
then
and
there
for
his
combative
testimony
on
tuesday
nothing
has
been
finalized
but
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
considering
holding
lewandowski
in
contempt
of
congress
or
making
a
referral
to
the
justice
department
according
to
multiple
lawmakers
and
congressional
aides
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
freely
describe
private
deliberations
if
you
don't
hold
witnesses
accountable
what
does
it
say
said
rep
pramila
jayapal
d-wash
a
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
i
do
think
that
we
have
to
walk
that
line
and
make
sure
that
we're
making
it
clear
to
people
that
you
know
we
are
well
aware
of
your
obstruction
of
congress
that
we
will
have
people
in
contempt
if
they
act
inappropriately
the
panel's
decision
to
proceed
against
lewandowski
comes
after
pelosi
d-calif
told
lawmakers
in
a
private
meeting
wednesday
night
that
no
witness
should
be
able
to
treat
members
of
congress
the
way
lewandowski
did
during
a
tuesday
hearing
before
the
committee
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
exchange
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
speak
frankly
lewandowski
talked
over
lawmakers
dodged
questions
made
snide
remarks
and
promoted
his
own
possible
u.s.
senate
campaign
in
new
hampshire
and
book
in
more
than
five
hours
of
testimony
i
would
have
held
him
in
contempt
right
then
and
there
pelosi
told
members
several
lawmakers
in
the
room
interpreted
pelosi's
remarks
as
a
dig
at
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
who
chose
not
to
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
for
his
defiant
behavior
on
tuesday
pelosi
spokeswoman
ashley
etienne
confirmed
the
exchange
but
said
pelosi's
comments
were
a
critique
of
the
witness's
behavior
not
the
handling
of
these
hearings
technically
staff
would
have
had
to
draft
up
a
contempt
resolution
to
vote
on
in
committee
and
democrats
said
they
thought
it
would
be
better
to
keep
the
focus
on
trump
other
democrats
however
said
the
committee
looked
weak
for
not
responding
earlier
in
the
day
rep
emanuel
cleaver
ii
d-mo
said
the
hearing
exposed
congress's
inability
to
overcome
presidential
stonewalling
the
founders
never
believed
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
happen
so
there's
no
way
to
deal
with
it
he
said
i
think
the
american
people
looked
at
that
and
thought
what's
going
on
we
understand
it
but
they
look
at
this
like
what
screaming
at
members
of
congress
the
panel
left
open
the
possibility
of
doing
contempt
at
a
later
date
however
choosing
to
adjourn
rather
than
end
the
hearing
after
pelosi's
comment
was
publicized
the
committee
is
revisiting
the
idea
house
democrats
eager
to
impeach
trump
struggle
to
galvanize
public
support
members
have
noted
that
nadler
and
pelosi
have
been
on
different
pages
for
months
nadler
has
been
keen
to
impeach
trump
while
pelosi
worries
about
political
blowback
not
only
from
some
in
her
caucus
but
in
the
election
lawmakers
say
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
tensions
spill
out
into
the
open
impeachment
proponents
say
they
worry
investigators
are
running
out
of
time
to
oust
the
president
and
want
to
move
soon
on
the
matter
of
lewandowski
the
two
appear
to
have
switched
sides
with
pelosi
suggesting
stronger
action
and
nadler
being
cautious
committee
staff
members
have
been
focused
on
the
impeachment
investigation
of
trump
and
taking
action
against
lewandowski
would
use
up
panel
time
and
resources
