the
question
elizabeth
warren
won't
answer
for
a
second
time
this
month
a
leading
democratic
presidential
candidate
was
grilled
by
late-night
host
stephen
colbert
and
for
a
second
time
this
month
the
candidate
didn't
really
give
him
the
answer
to
what
he
was
asking
two
weeks
after
colbert
resisted
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
attempts
to
downplay
his
false
war-hero
story
the
comedian
this
week
gave
sen
elizabeth
warren
mass
a
talking-to
over
a
question
she
refuses
to
answer
it's
about
whether
she
would
raise
middle-class
taxes
to
pay
for
her
expensive
medicare-for-all
health-care
program
at
each
of
the
last
two
debates
warren
has
been
pressed
on
this
and
declined
to
directly
answer
each
time
she
has
pivoted
to
how
the
middle
class
would
see
its
overall
costs
including
taxes
and
health-care
expenditures
decline
so
colbert
tried
again
and
he
even
volunteered
an
argument
for
her
here's
the
exchange
warren
then
spoke
for
about
two
minutes
during
which
she
never
addressed
the
question
about
whether
middle-class
taxes
would
go
up
first
off
it's
valid
for
warren
to
want
to
refocus
the
issue
on
total
costs
rather
than
just
taxes
if
you
are
spending
on
health-care
costs
right
now
paying
an
extra
or
in
taxes
getting
those
health-care
costs
wiped
out
would
be
a
pretty
good
deal
provided
the
care
is
as
good
this
is
why
warren
supporters
hate
this
question
they
view
it
as
an
unfair
attempt
to
give
republicans
a
talking
point
that
elizabeth
warren
is
going
to
raise
middle-class
taxes
when
in
fact
people's
total
costs
would
go
down
but
there
are
a
lot
of
assumptions
built
into
that
the
first
is
that
they
would
all
wind
up
in
net-positive
territory
studies
have
shown
most
people
under
a
single-payer
system
would
wind
up
paying
less
in
overall
costs
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
consistent
across
the
population
a
rand
study
for
new
york
for
example
showed
that
such
a
system
in
that
state
would
reduce
average
costs
for
every
income
group
up
to
the
th
to
th
percentile
but
it
added
that
even
a
little
bit
of
tax
avoidance
by
the
wealthiest
citizens
would
mean
potentially
increasing
the
burden
on
middle-
and
lower-income
residents
and
that
the
results
depend
on
assumptions
about
uncertain
factors
as
npr
reported
on
this
question
whether
a
family
would
wind
up
in
net-positive
territory
would
also
depend
on
how
much
it
is
currently
paying
for
health
care
for
example
if
it
pays
little
because
of
a
generous
employer
or
if
it
doesn't
have
a
plan
the
other
question
is
whether
the
proposals
put
forward
by
candidates
such
as
warren
would
completely
fund
the
program
or
whether
more
tax
revenue
would
be
needed
even
considering
all
that
colbert's
point
is
worth
lifting
up
why
not
just
level
with
people
about
it
why
not
say
taxes
will
go
up
but
total
costs
should
go
down
when
you
factor
in
everything
and
that
it's
about
the
common
good
why
not
make
sure
people
fully
understand
how
this
will
work
that
seems
to
be
effectively
what
warren
is
saying
but
you
could
perhaps
incorrectly
interpret
her
non-answer
as
suggesting
that
all
of
the
tax
burden
would
be
borne
by
the
wealthy
rather
than
the
middle
class
even
if
you
stand
to
pay
less
in
total
costs
the
amount
your
taxes
change
or
go
up
does
matter
especially
if
you
believe
there
would
be
a
trade-off
in
quality
when
the
government
is
in
charge
of
health
care
warren's
non-answer
also
stands
in
contrast
to
her
fellow
medicare-for-all
supporter
on
the
debate
stage
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
his
page
explaining
the
funding
for
his
medicare-for-all
program
includes
a
percent
income-based
premium
for
the
average
family
of
four
earning
a
year
while
of
course
emphasizing
that
they
would
come
out
ahead
people
who
have
health
care
under
medicare-for-all
will
have
no
premiums
no
deductibles
no
co-payments
no
out-of-pocket
expenses
sanders
said
at
june's
debate
yes
they
will
pay
more
in
taxes
but
less
in
health
care
warren
is
making
a
play
in
this
race
as
the
personable
accessible
candidate
as
well
as
the
candidate
who
has
a
plan
for
everything
bold
radical
ideas
but
how
she
would
pay
for
this
massive
expansion
of
government
is
still
murky
including
on
this
key
point
senator
warren
is
known
for
being
straightforward
and
was
extremely
evasive
when
asked
that
question
and
we've
seen
that
repeatedly
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
a
fellow
democratic
presidential
candidate
said
thursday
on
cnn
he
wasn't
wrong
