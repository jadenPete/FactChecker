the
daily
trump's
purported
promise
to
a
foreign
leader
came
after
the
white
house
scaled
back
readouts
president

boards

on
wednesday
at
marine

miramar
in

ap
the
big
idea
after
president
trump
initiated
a
phone
call
with
vladimir
putin
on
july
the
american
people
found
out
when
the
russian
government
posted
about
it
on
twitter
and
facebook
the
white
house
press
office
waited
several
hours
to
confirm
that
the
call
took
place
and
then
did
so
with
a
two-sentence
statement
sent
to
a
pool
reporter
after
p
m
trump
expressed
concern
over
the
vast
wildfires
afflicting
siberia
the
word
statement
read
the
leaders
also
discussed
trade
between
the
two
countries
the
word
russian
readout
went
further
the
president
of
russia
regards
the
us
president's
offer
as
a
sign
that
it
is
possible
that
full-scale
bilateral
relations
will
be
restored
in
the
future
the
presidents
of
russia
and
the
united
states
agreed
to
continue
contacts
in
the
form
of
telephone
conversations
as
well
as
personal
meetings
this
is
one
of
several
newsworthy
communications
that
trump
had
with
a
foreign
head
of
state
that
first
became
public
because
the
other
side
disclosed
it
the
trump
white
house
has
curtailed
the
longstanding
bipartisan
practice
of
automatically
sending
out
summaries
of
presidential
communications
with
other
world
leaders
that
retreat
from
transparency
which
has
often
allowed
adversaries
to
shape
the
narrative
merits
fresh
scrutiny
and
raises
a
battery
of
new
questions
in
the
wake
of
a
big
scoop
overnight
by
my
colleagues
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
has
triggered
a
tense
showdown
between
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
and
congress
involves
president
trump's
communications
with
a
foreign
leader
greg
miller
ellen
nakashima
and
shane
harris
report
citing
two
former
u.s.
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
trump's
interaction
with
the
foreign
leader
included
a
promise
that
was
regarded
as
so
troubling
that
it
prompted
an
official
in
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
to
file
a
formal
whistleblower
complaint
with
the
inspector
general
for
the
intelligence
community
it
was
not
immediately
clear
which
foreign
leader
trump
was
speaking
with
or
what
he
pledged
to
deliver
one
former
official
said
the
communication
was
a
phone
call
intelligence
community
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
determined
that
the
complaint
was
credible
and
troubling
enough
to
be
considered
a
matter
of
urgent
concern
a
legal
threshold
that
requires
notification
of
congressional
oversight
committees
but
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
refused
to
share
details
about
trump's
alleged
transgression
with
lawmakers
touching
off
a
legal
and
political
dispute
that
has
spilled
into
public
view
and
prompted
speculation
that
the
spy
chief
is
improperly
protecting
the
president
the
complaint
was
filed
with
atkinson's
office
on
aug
a
date
on
which
trump
was
at
his
golf
resort
in
new
jersey
white
house
records
indicate
that
trump
had
had
conversations
or
interactions
with
at
least
five
foreign
leaders
in
the
preceding
five
weeks
one
of
those
five
interactions
was
that
july
phone
call
with
putin
on
aug
trump
reiterated
his
call
for
russia
to
be
allowed
to
rejoin
the
group
of
seven
industrial
nations
i
guess
president
obama
because
putin
outsmarted
him
president
obama
thought
it
wasn't
a
good
thing
to
have
russia
in
so
he
wanted
russia
out
trump
said
in
the
oval
office
before
flying
to
france
for
the
g-
referring
to
his
predecessor's
push
for
a
united
stand
against
russia
after
it
annexed
ukraine's
crimea
region
but
i
think
it's
much
more
appropriate
to
have
russia
in
russia
was
expelled
from
the
group
in
after
the
annexation
which
obama
called
a
violation
of
international
law
the
kremlin
subsequently
interfered
in
the
u.s.
presidential
election
if
the
whistleblower
complaint
turns
out
to
be
about
something
trump
said
on
the
putin
call
it
would
certainly
not
be
the
first
time
the
president's
interactions
with
one
of
the
united
states
biggest
geopolitical
rivals
have
caused
heartburn
for
career
intelligence
professionals
in
march
trump
ignored
specific
warnings
from
his
national
security
advisers
when
he
congratulated
putin
on
his
reelection
do
not
congratulate
his
briefing
materials
stated
in
all-capital
letters
experts
said
putin
only
got
percent
of
the
vote
because
it
was
a
rigged
election
in
may
trump
revealed
classified
information
about
espionage
operations
in
syria
to
senior
russian
officials
in
the
oval
office
trump
has
gone
to
extraordinary
lengths
to
conceal
details
of
his
conversations
with
putin
including
on
at
least
one
occasion
taking
possession
of
the
notes
of
his
own
interpreter
and
instructing
the
linguist
not
to
discuss
what
had
transpired
with
other
administration
officials
trump
did
so
after
a
meeting
with
putin
in
in
hamburg
that
was
also
attended
by
then-secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson

reported
in

learned
of
trump's
actions
when
a
white
house
adviser
and
a
senior
state
department
official
sought
information
from
the
interpreter
beyond
a
readout
shared
by
tillerson
the
white
house
decision
to
restrict
private
and
public
readouts
of
trump's
calls
with
foreign
leaders
followed
a
series
of
leaks
that
embarrassed

out
only

o'brien's
appointment
solidifies
pompeo's
status
as
the
most
influential
foreign
policy
voice
in
the

pompeo
has
known
o'brien
for
years
and
backed
his
ascension
to
the
job
after
battling
with
bolton
over
an
array
of
policy
issues
on

officials
said

some

have
been

though
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
o'brien's
efforts
were
pivotal
in
the
release
of
those
freed

criticized
trump's
foreign

on
wednesday
at

saying
that
inviting

david
sent
a
terrible

that
it
was

bolton
also
said
that
any
negotiations
with
north
korea
and
iran
were
doomed
to
failure
according
to
two
attendees
all
the
north
koreans
and

want
to
do
is
negotiate
for
relief
from

a
school

it

the
