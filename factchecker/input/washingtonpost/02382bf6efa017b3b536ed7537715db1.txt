house
democrats
eager
to
impeach
president
trump
are
struggling
to
galvanize
public
opinion
a
major
challenge
that
has
delighted
the
white
house
and
flummoxed
capitol
hill
investigators
who
say
they're
running
short
on
time
the
house
judiciary
committee
brought
in
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
on
tuesday
for
the
first
in
a
series
of
fall
hearings
aimed
at
convincing
voters
of
the
need
to
impeach
the
president
but
while
the
acrimonious
testimony
drew
headlines
and
attention
even
some
impeachment
proponents
said
it
wouldn't
sway
the
public
if
you're
looking
to
draw
out
information
and
begin
shaping
a
narrative
for
the
american
people
that
wasn't
the
witness
to
do
it
said
rep
jared
huffman
d-calif
a
longtime
impeachment
backer
the
skepticism
underscores
a
problem
democrats
face
as
they
weigh
whether
to
draft
articles
of
impeachment
this
fall
voters
overwhelmingly
oppose
a
move
to
oust
the
president
and
some
polls
even
show
sentiment
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
the
public
some
democrats
fear
is
becoming
desensitized
to
trump-related
scandals
making
the
committee's
job
convincing
voters
even
more
difficult
former
special
counsel
robert
s.
mueller
iii's
report
detailed
episodes
of
possible
obstruction
of
the
probe
into
russian
interference
in
the
election
but
if
the
report
wasn't
enough
to
move
the
polling
on
impeachment
democrats
wonder
if
hearings
with
people
such
as
lewandowski
will
there
is
a
numbness
that
is
occurring
month
by
month
said
rep
daniel
kildee
d-mich
he
gets
more
and
more
outrageous
far
more
bold
but
there's
this
immunity
that
he
seems
to
be
developing
any
other
president
had
they
done
one
of
those
things
trump
has
the
public
would
be
screaming
said
rep
lois
frankel
d-fla
the
public
has
become
numb
and
he
gets
away
with
it
trump
and
white
house
officials
meanwhile
are
reveling
in
democrats
difficulties
in
fact
the
president
who
watched
lewandowski's
testimony
from
air
force
one
on
tuesday
was
laughing
and
joking
about
the
hearing
arguing
that
democrats
have
no
idea
what
they're
doing
and
that
no
one
cared
about
the
mueller
report
anymore
according
to
one
person
who
spoke
with
him
the
individual
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
freely
describe
what
transpired
two
white
house
officials
suggested
that
the
administration
could
defy
congressional
requests
because
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
has
made
it
clear
she
is
reluctant
about
impeachment
they
also
have
calculated
that
there
won't
be
a
public
price
to
pay
for
stonewalling
congress
in
part
because
the
clock
is
running
out
when
i'm
looking
at
the
legislative
calendar
you're
seeing
there
is
not
much
left
there
how
much
can
they
really
do
between
now
and
when
everyone
is
trying
to
run
for
their
seats
asked
a
senior
white
house
official
who
also
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
describe
private
discussions
the
american
people
deserve
better
than
the
democrats
pointless
showboating
and
political
theater
masquerading
as
an
impeachment
hearing
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
said
in
a
statement
wednesday
night
rather
than
scrambling
for
their
five
minutes
of
tv
time
they
should
consider
getting
to
work
to
help
the
people
of
this
country
the
gap
between
democrats
desire
to
impeach
trump
and
the
public's
position
means
the
party
could
find
itself
in
a
political
bind
this
fall
do
they
follow
their
base
and
vote
to
impeach
him
or
do
nothing
and
risk
history's
judgment
for
standing
pat
as
well
as
liberal
wrath
heading
into
the
elections
house
judiciary
committee
democrats
argue
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
either-or
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
n.y.
often
notes
that
only
percent
of
americans
supported
removing
president
richard
m.
nixon
before
lawmakers
began
their
impeachment
inquiry
in
but
by
the
summer
of
a
majority
backed
his
ouster
suggesting
the
panel
can
build
a
case
against
trump
i
see
the
whole
country
and
the
whole
congress
as
in
an
educational
phase
right
now
said
rep
jamie
raskin
d-md
a
judiciary
committee
member
i
know
everybody
wants
to
jump
to
the
end
of
the
process
but
we
really
are
in
the
active
investigative
mode
on
capitol
hill
however
there's
a
sense
that
time
left
to
move
sentiment
is
running
out
lawmakers
say
they
need
to
decide
on
impeachment
by
the
end
of
the
year
leaving
the
judiciary
committee
only
a
couple
of
months
to
make
its
public
case
that
pressure
has
caused
occasional
tension
in
the
pro-impeachment
caucus
with
some
questioning
the
judiciary
strategy
and
wondering
why
they're
not
doing
more
hearings
disagreements
were
also
evident
wednesday
in
the
wake
of
the
lewandowski
hearing
with
some
democrats
dismissing
the
exercise
as
unhelpful
huffman
said
the
hearing
amounted
to
a
food
fight
although
he
blamed
the
combative
former
trump
campaign
official
not
his
colleagues
for
the
result
he
along
with
other
democrats
wondered
whether
the
panel
would
be
better
served
to
have
its
staff
do
more
of
the
questioning
after
hours
of
partisan
bickering
judiciary
staff
lawyer
barry
berke
had
some
success
pinning
lewandowski
down
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
tuesday
i
mean
i
wouldn't
presume
to
tell
chairman
nadler
how
to
do
it
but
if
you
want
to
get
the
goods
up
front
that
seems
like
a
good
way
to
do
it
huffman
said
clearly
it
was
more
productive
judiciary
panel
member
j.
luis
correa
d-calif
however
dismissed
the
idea
that
lawmakers
would
yield
to
unelected
lawyers
members
are
pretty
jealous
and
protective
of
their
five
minutes
he
said
referring
to
the
allotted
time
democrats
have
for
questioning
witnesses
lewandowski
mocks
democrats
talks
over
lawmakers
promotes
possible
senate
bid
rep
emanuel
cleaver
ii
d-mo
said
the
hearing
essentially
made
the
democrats
look
weak
exposing
congress's
inability
to
overcome
presidential
stonewalling
lewandowski
talked
over
lawmakers
dodged
questions
and
even
used
the
hearing
to
promote
a
potential
u.s.
senate
bid
in
new
hampshire
the
founders
never
believed
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
happen
so
there's
no
way
to
deal
with
it
he
said
i
think
the
american
people
looked
at
that
and
thought
what's
going
on
we
understand
it
but
they
look
at
this
like
what
screaming
at
members
of
congress
democrats
on
the
judiciary
committee
defended
their
strategy
wednesday
arguing
that
lewandowski
gave
them
fodder
to
say
trump
has
trampled
the
constitution
and
is
not
respecting
the
powers
of
congress
even
though
it
was
a
rocky
hearing
yesterday
in
retrospect
as
people
think
about
it
they
will
come
to
the
conclusions
that
corey
lewandowski
was
lying
and
he
was
covering
up
for
the
president
and
he
was
protecting
the
president
and
they
want
to
know
why
said
rep
hank
johnson
d-ga
so
it
will
increase
the
curiosity
and
the
suspiciousness
of
the
american
people
rep
david
n.
cicilline
d-r
i.
also
said
it
was
unrealistic
for
one
hearing
to
move
public
sentiment
this
is
a
process
in
which
we're
building
a
case
he
said
this
notion
that
like
oh
is
this
going
to
turn
the
tide
today
no
congressional
republicans
have
goaded
the
party
over
the
apparent
insistence
on
moving
forward
with
impeachment
on
wednesday
rep
guy
reschenthaler
r-pa
insisted
that
the
democratic
rank
and
file
are
rabid
over
the
idea
of
impeaching
trump
and
dubbed
them
the
party
of
impeachment
democrats
have
blamed
the
white
house
for
making
their
job
difficult
the
trump
administration
has
blocked
progress
on
more
than
hill
investigations
keeping
ex-aides
from
testifying
and
documents
from
being
handed
over
that's
why
judiciary
democrats
are
also
looking
to
the
courts
to
help
them
make
their
case
to
the
public
a
circuit
court
is
expected
to
rule
in
late
october
on
whether
former
white
house
counsel
donald
mcgahn
must
testify
we're
trying
to
craft
a
story
get
the
facts
out
there
for
the
american
people
so
they
can
see
what
is
happening
with
their
government
said
house
democratic
caucus
vice
chair
katherine
m.
clark
d-mass
and
i
think
as
those
facts
come
out
we're
going
to
see
where
public
sentiment
is
because
we
want
to
do
this
as
the
speaker
said
many
times
in
a
unified
way
with
public
sentiment
behind
us
