of

stands
about
feet-tall
or
so
in
the
corner
of
the
office
of
ken
cuccinelli
the
acting
director
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
it
overlooks
massachusetts
avenue
from
floor-to-ceiling
windows
it
wasn't
a
gift
it
was
meant
to
shame
him
protesters
left
it
outside
the
agency's
headquarters
last
month
after
cuccinelli
reinterpreted
the
inscription
at
the
statue
of
liberty's
base
to
align
it
with
policy
changes
aimed
at
restricting
legal
immigration
cuccinelli
brought
it
upstairs
took
a
selfie
and
tweeted
it
it's
our
newest
office
decoration
he
wrote
like
his
boss
cuccinelli
has
a
knack
for
twitter
trolling
he's
also
experienced
at
talking-head
television
another
skill
that
pays
dividends
with
president
donald
trump
and
he's
now
emerging
as
the
public
face
of
the
president's
hard-line
immigration
policies
the
most
important
thing
is
that
communication
was
part
of
the
charge
i
got
from
the
president
he
said
in
an
interview
with
the
associated
press
so
we
just
charge
ahead
it's
probably
the
top
policy
of
interest
to
the
american
people
and
it's
not
going
to
change
any
time
soon
he
said
the
department
of
homeland
security
under
trump
is
making
massive
changes
to
u.s.
immigration
policy
it
is
denying
asylum
claims
by
rendering
ineligible
anyone
who
came
to
the
u.s.
mexico
border
through
a
third
country
tightening
immigration
benefits
and
moving
toward
a
merit-based
system
the
changes
are
thrilling
trump's
base
and
enraging
opponents
who
say
the
u.s.
is
abandoning
its
humanitarian
mission
cuccinelli
took
over
uscis
a
part
of
homeland
security
a
few
months
ago
following
a
white
house-orchestrated
staff
shake
up
at
the
department
that
also
felled
then-secretary
kirstjen
nielsen
he
replaced
l.
francis
cissna
who
changed
the
motto
of
uscis
to
delete
nation
of
immigrants
the
agency
manages
green
cards
benefits
naturalization
visas
and
asylum
but
the
various
homeland
security
immigration
agencies
tend
to
blend
these
days
with
the
ever-changing
leaders
promoting
trump's
overall
immigration
agenda
they
all
appeared
together
this
week
in
laredo
texas
to
tour
tent
courts
where
hundreds
of
migrants
forced
to
wait
in
mexico
pleaded
their
asylum
cases
cuccinelli
took
the
lead
in
talking
to
media
he
frequently
comments
on
twitter
and
tv
about
immigration
subjects
outside
his
agency
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
acting
head
mark
morgan
another
frequent
tv
commenter
joked
that
no
one
knows
the
difference
among
them
which
is
a
major
problem
in
one
sense
but
it
also
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
just
address
the
issue
and
not
have
to
create
these
buckets
he
said
but
cuccinelli's
impact
has
been
felt
at
his
agency
there
are
reports
of
staff
reassignments
asylum
officers
in
tears
over
policy
changes
and
friction
over
increasing
restrictions
michael
knowles
an
asylum
officer
and
spokesman
for
the
union
afge
national
cis
council
said
morale
among
asylum
officers
is
very
low
he
said
cuccinelli
has
scolded
them
for
approving
too
many
initial
screenings
and
it
seemed
like
every
administration
whether
left
right
or
center
has
supported
our
country's
asylum
and
refugee
programs
because
giving
safe
haven
to
the
oppressed
was
always
seen
as
the
patriotic
american
thing
to
do
he
said
until
now
despite
the
criticism
nearly
new
u.s.
citizens
will
be
naturalized
this
week
in
more
than
special
ceremonies
in
celebration
of
constitution
week
during
s
budget
year
the
agency
naturalized
than
people
a
five-year
high
in
new
oaths
of
citizenship
cuccinelli
is
proud
of
those
figures
he
talked
in-depth
about
the
challenges
with
asylum
case
backlogs
he
says
he
does
not
view
uscis
as
an
immigrant
benefits
agency
but
rather
a
vetting
agency
that
doesn't
mean
we
don't
offer
benefits
but
it
does
mean
that
our
first
obligation
is
to
uphold
the
standards
including
security
standards
he
said
the
year-old
was
born
in
edison
new
jersey
a
descendant
of
italian
immigrants
who
came
through
ellis
island
he
has
said
his
relatives
were
required
to
speak
english
well
enough
to
work
and
prove
they
would
not
be
a
burden
to
the
system
he
also
has
said
it's
not
possible
to
compare
immigrants
coming
today
with
those
years
ago
in
part
because
there
was
no
welfare
state
then
cuccinelli
has
long
held
views
on
immigration
that
he
says
align
closely
with
trump's
and
so
far
he
has
the
president's
enthusiastic
support
he's
fantastic
trump
told
the
morning
show
fox
friends
he's
tough
as
you
get
and
smart
and
he's
doing
much
of
the
legal
work
cuccinelli's
name
had
been
tossed
around
for
months
for
an
immigration-related
position
but
there
were
always
concerns
about
his
ability
to
be
confirmed
a
former
virginia
attorney
general
he
ran
for
governor
in
but
lost
to
democrat
terry
mcauliffe
he
has
in
the
past
advocated
for
denying
citizenship
to
american-born
children
of
parents
living
in
the
u.s.
illegally
mr
cuccinelli
is
an
anti-immigrant
fringe
figure
besides
being
a
right-wing
commentator
cuccinelli
is
completely
unqualified
and
likely
wants
to
decimate
the
agency
said
the
chairman
of
the
house
homeland
security
committee
rep
bennie
thompson
d-miss
but
it
wasn't
just
immigration
views
that
generated
unease
among
senators
as
the
former
head
of
the
senate
conservatives
fund
cuccinelli
was
highly
critical
of
senate
gop
leadership
once
advocating
for
the
removal
of
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
and
his
entire
leadership
team
serving
in
an
acting
capacity
does
not
require
senate
confirmation
acting
directors
have
become
common
at
homeland
security
a
sprawling
person
department
that
also
handles
election
security
and
natural
disasters
of
course
it
would
always
be
better
cuccinelli
said
of
senate
confirmation
but
the
most
important
thing
is
getting
the
job
done
for
cuccinelli
that
meant
getting
regulation
changes
finalized
that
could
deny
green
cards
to
immigrants
who
use
medicaid
food
stamps
housing
vouchers
or
other
forms
of
public
assistance
critics
have
argued
that
many
immigrants
won't
seek
the
benefits
they
need
because
they
fear
the
consequences
it
was
that
change
that
prompted
the
arrival
of
the
paper-m
ch
statue
of
liberty
in
a
television
interview
cuccinelli
had
been
pressed
about
whether
the
new
rules
contradicted
the
inscription
at
the
base
of
the
statue
written
by
poet
emma
lazarus
welcoming
huddled
masses
of
immigrants
to
american
shores
he
said
lazarus
was
referring
to
people
coming
from
europe
and
that
the
nation
is
looking
to
receive
migrants
who
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
her
biographer
said
the
poem
embraces
immigrants
from
all
places
the
statue
appeared
after
that
with
a
sign
that
read
immigrants
welcome
but
cuccinelli
noted
it
was
missing
the
inscription
at
the
base
