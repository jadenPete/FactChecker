the
story
of
jimmy
carter's
peanut
farm
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
you
may
have
heard
the
washington
post
june
when
jimmy
carter
was
elected
president
in
he
put
his
peanut
farm
into
a
blind
trust
you've
probably
heard
this
before
it's
a
surprisingly
common
bit
of
presidential
trivia
these
days
given
how
neatly
it
serves
as
a
countervailing
example
to
president
trump's
apparent
lack
of
interest
in
dissociating
his
expansive
business
from
the
workings
of
government
oh
the
military
spent
at
a
trump
organization
property
in
scotland
amazing
jimmy
carter
had
to
put
his
peanut
farm
into
a
freaking
blind
trust
but
that
representation
of
what
carter
did
doesn't
really
capture
the
complexity
or
scale
of
his
private
business
interest
it's
a
longer
story
than
that
involving
two
fairly
large
businesses
particularly
for
the
time
a
cozy
relationship
with
the
guy
put
in
charge
of
his
business
and
at
one
point
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
to
dig
into
loans
one
of
his
businesses
received
from
a
bank
whose
president
ended
up
serving
in
carter's
administration
we
can
start
with
the
scale
of
that
peanut
farm
what
was
really
at
stake
was
a
pair
of
businesses
carter
farms
owned
between
and
acres
of
land
with
carter
controlling
percent
of
the
corporation
he
also
had
a
majority
stake
in
carter
warehouse
a
peanut
warehousing
business
based
in
his
hometown
of
plains
ga
in
the
years
before
his
presidential
run
in
day-to-day
operations
at
the
warehouse
were
managed
by
his
brother
billy
carter
billy
carter
would
end
up
being
a
perpetual
thorn
in
president
jimmy
carter's
side
a
tendency
which
began
even
before
carter
took
the
oath
of
office
during
those
years
before
the
presidential
bid
for
example
billy
carter
took
out
loans
from
the
national
bank
of
georgia
to
expand
warehouse
operations
at
a
time
which
overlapped
with
a
peanut
drought
those
loans
ultimately
totaled
million
about
million
today
before
jimmy
carter
was
inaugurated
on
jan
he
announced
a
broad
set
of
rules
meant
to
dictate
the
behavior
of
administration
officials
after
all
he
was
the
first
president
elected
in
the
post-watergate
era
and
scrutiny
of
presidential
ethics
was
robust
according
to
the
plan
announced
today
the
new
york
times
reported
mr
carter
will
sell
all
his
personal
stock
divert
the
royalties
from
his
autobiography
why
not
the
best
into
a
foundation
that
will
establish
a
future
library
to
house
presidential
papers
and
transfer
to
the
trust
his
interest
in
carter's
warehouse
and
carter
farms
inc
the
intent
of
this
plan
mr
carter
told
reporters
this
morning
the
report
continued
is
to
insure
that
whatever
happens
here
in
plains
based
on
my
decisions
concerning
agriculture
will
not
affect
my
income
one
way
or
the
other
it
didn't
take
long
for
the
administration
to
face
ethics
questions
however
carter's
nominee
to
serve
as
the
head
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
was
bert
lance
an
adviser
to
his
campaign
and
the
president
of
the
bank
that
gave
carter's
company
that
large
loan
lance
resigned
under
an
ethics
cloud
in
september
facing
questions
about
his
management
of
the
bank
shortly
after
his
inauguration
carter
announced
that
the
blind
trust
that
would
manage
his
businesses
would
be
run
by
charles
kirbo
a
longtime
associate
and
confidant
in
early
february
he
fleshed
out
the
structure
of
the
trust
in
more
detail
at
that
point
carter
handed
over
control
to
his
trustee
kirbo
asking
that
he
consider
possible
effects
of
any
decisions
on
billy
carter
and
the
possibility
that
his
son
would
someday
be
involved
in
the
business
above
all
the
document
outlining
the
trust
articulated
president
carter
wants
the
trustee
to
arrange
the
assets
of
the
trust
so
that
no
one
should
reasonably
assert
that
his
actions
as
president
were
motivated
by
a
desire
to
foster
his
own
personal
monetary
gain
or
profit
shortly
afterward
billy
carter
announced
that
he
planned
to
buy
out
his
brother's
share
of
the
warehouse
business
kirbo
now
in
charge
rejected
the
proposal
eventually
pushing
billy
carter
out
of
the
business
that
september
billy
carter
would
later
publicly
bash
kirbo
but
quietly
also
received
a
loan
from
the
separate
farm
business
in
june
president
carter
released
personal
financial
documents
including
the
revelation
that
his
net
worth
had
declined
white
house
officials
arguing
that
the
trust
is
blind
and
that
neither
they
nor
carter
is
informed
its
operations
the
washington
post
reported
at
the
time
said
they
could
not
explain
the
loss
however
white
house
counsel
robert
lipshutz
said
it
is
probable
that
the
loss
involved
transactions
of
the
carter
family
peanut
warehouse
business
which
represents
a
major
share
of
the
trust
in
february
kirbo
had
put
the
warehouse
business
on
the
market
i
could
have
sold
it
some
time
ago
to
foreigners
kirbo
told
the
post
but
there's
been
enough
bad
publicity
about
it
already
without
selling
to
them
kirbo
emphasized
that
the
would-be
foreign
buyers
were
not
arabs
the
post
reported
at
the
time
that
was
important
in
part
because
of
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
arab
countries
at
the
time
it
was
also
important
because
billy
carter
had
been
in
the
news
in
january
cozying
up
to
libyan
nationals
and
decrying
the
jewish
media
for
disparaging
arab
countries
the
next
month
a
warehouse
employee
told
the
post
that
the
loans
president
carter's
business
received
from
national
bank
of
georgia
were
secured
with
peanuts
that
were
sold
by
billy
carter
instead
of
being
held
as
collateral
a
special
counsel
paul
j.
curran
was
appointed
to
investigate
the
loans
and
see
if
any
of
the
loan
money
went
to
carter's
campaign
carter
was
also
subject
to
new
ethics
rules
that
he'd
signed
into
law
as
the
ethics
in
government
act
of
for
his
companies
to
be
held
in
a
true
blind
trust
he
would
have
had
to
have
maintained
a
strict
wall
between
himself
and
kirbo
but
kirbo
still
served
as
an
adviser
to
carter
with
a
june
story
in
the
times
noting
that
kirbo
was
both
a
frequent
guest
at
the
white
house
and
had
advised
the
president
on
staffing
decisions
new
york
times
june
given
that
relationship
carter's
team
reported
financial
details
of
his
businesses
describing
the
trust
as
open
under
the
definitions
of
the
new
law
as
opposed
to
blind
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
loan
to
billy
carter
in
was
made
public
by
then
president
carter
was
a
millionaire
worth
about
million
in
dollars
the
trust
was
worth
about
about
million
now
that
october
the
special
counsel
curran
cleared
anyone
of
wrongdoing
in
the
bank
loans
investigation
the
special
counsel
said
no
evidence
whatsoever
was
discovered
that
any
monies
were
diverted
from
the
warehouse
into
the
campaign
the
post
reported
as
for
whether
any
criminal
charges
were
warranted
curran
said
the
answer
is
also
a
clear
no
the
only
person
considered
for
charges
was
an
employee
of
the
bank
in
november
carter
lost
his
reelection
bid
in
the
face
of
a
stagnant
economy
and
international
tensions
the
following
january
ronald
reagan
was
inaugurated
and
carter
returned
to
plains
in
march
the
need
for
the
semi-blind
trust
gone
the
warehouse
company
was
sold
to
an
illinois
feed
company
for
million
by
then
trump
years
younger
was
already
a
millionaire
in
manhattan
he
wouldn't
be
president
for
another
years
