trump
realigns
national
security
team
with
a
low-profile
adviser
president
trump
named
robert
c.
o'brien
as
his
new
national
security
adviser
wednesday
as
he
seeks
to
realign
his
staff
and
temper
internal
divisions
following
the
turbulent
reign
of
former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
the
appointment
of
o'brien
solidifies
the
status
of
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
as
the
most
influential
foreign
policy
voice
in
the
administration
pompeo
has
known
o'brien
for
years
and
backed
his
ascension
to
the
job
after
battling
with
bolton
over
an
array
of
policy
issues
on
afghanistan
iran
and
north
korea
u.s.
officials
said
o'brien
who
served
as
the
nation's
top
hostage
negotiator
will
now
take
on
a
far
more
daunting
set
of
responsibilities
as
trump's
fourth
national
security
adviser
he
takes
over
amid
escalating
tensions
with
iran
a
high-stakes
trade
war
with
china
and
concerns
about
whether
he
wields
enough
clout
to
forge
consensus
among
the
u.s.
government's
competing
egos
and
agencies
but
officials
said
they
hoped
his
friendly
demeanor
and
experience
as
a
lawyer
could
bring
more
stability
and
collegiality
to
an
often
chaotic
policymaking
process
going
into
the
election
a
major
concern
is
cutting
back
on
the
drama
said
a
senior
u.s.
official
who
like
others
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
speak
about
internal
dynamics
trump
praised
his
new
pick
in
los
angeles
on
wednesday
saying
o'brien
has
worked
with
me
for
quite
a
while
now
on
hostages
and
we
have
a
tremendous
track
record
on
hostages
o'brien
called
it
a
privilege
to
take
the
adviser
role
and
cited
a
number
of
challenges
he
would
take
on
including
keeping
america
safe
and
rebuilding
the
military
on
the
heightened
tensions
with
iran
he
said
that
we're
looking
at
those
issues
now
and
that
he
would
advise
the
president
privately
on
how
to
handle
the
situation
several
officials
said
o'brien
would
be
less
resistant
to
following
the
president's
orders
than
his
predecessor
who
opposed
trump's
negotiations
with
north
korea
withdrawal
plans
in
afghanistan
and
interest
in
engaging
with
iranian
leaders
although
o'brien
is
not
known
for
sharing
bolton's
brand
of
rigid
unilateralism
his
past
writings
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
u.s.
alliances
and
american
global
leadership
a
viewpoint
that
could
clash
with
aspects
of
trump's
america
first
agenda
robert
is
strong
on
defense
he'll
be
firm
on
china
he
is
a
believer
in
american
alliances
how
similar
is
that
to
bolton
i
would
leave
it
at
that
kent
lucken
a
longtime
friend
of
o'brien's
who
worked
with
him
on
mitt
romney's
presidential
campaign
said
in
a
phone
interview
a
major
question
is
whether
o'brien
whose
personal
history
and
rapport
with
the
president
has
been
limited
can
formulate
a
coherent
policy
out
of
the
president's
desires
while
managing
his
advisers
at
the
pentagon
state
department
and
treasury
without
the
power
that
results
from
deep
relationship
with
the
president
a
reputation
among
the
national
security
community
or
deep
expertise
in
government
a
weak
national
security
adviser
causes
disorder
warned
john
gans
author
of
white
house
warriors
a
book
on
the
history
of
the
national
security
council
as
evidence
gans
pointed
to
the
iran-contra
affair
of
the
s
and
the
role
of
president
ronald
reagan's
national
security
advisers
bud
mcfarlane
and
john
poindexter
whose
standing
was
weaker
than
that
of
their
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
although
most
suspect
it
was
the
result
of
ambitions
iran-contra
was
really
the
result
of
bad
management
neither
mcfarlane
nor
poindexter
had
the
power
to
get
principals
like
secretary
of
state
george
shultz
or
defense
secretary
caspar
weinberger
to
stop
arguing
president
ronald
reagan
to
stick
with
a
decision
or
the
strong-willed
staff
to
take
no
for
an
answer
he
said
john
bolton's
turbulent
tenure
comes
to
a
trumpian
end
officials
said
a
policy
process
that
doesn't
create
new
competing
factions
would
be
welcome
particularly
by
acting
white
house
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
who
observed
the
deep
fissures
between
bolton
and
senior
pentagon
and
state
department
officials
the
position
of
national
security
adviser
does
not
require
senate
confirmation
u.s.
officials
hope
o'brien's
appointment
will
put
an
end
to
the
rampant
feuding
between
staffers
for
pompeo
and
bolton
who
at
times
did
not
share
information
with
each
other
out
of
suspicion
that
it
would
be
used
to
undermine
their
positions
ahead
of
a
presidential
policy
decision
two
people
who
worked
closely
with
o'brien
described
him
as
a
savvy
political
animal
who
had
cultivated
a
close
relationship
with
pompeo
on
hostage
related
issues
and
had
long
sought
a
promotion
within
the
trump
administration
they
said
having
an
ally
in
the
white
house
would
further
strengthen
the
position
of
pompeo
who
has
been
more
careful
than
any
of
his
departed
colleagues
in
refusing
to
break
with
trump
publicly
besides
o'brien
pompeo
also
maintains
close
ties
to
cia
director
gina
haspel
who
worked
for
him
when
he
led
the
spy
agency
and
defense
secretary
mark
t.
esper
his
former
classmate
at
the
u.s.
military
academy
upon
taking
the
job
o'brien
will
become
the
highest-ranking
mormon
in
the
u.s.
government
an
important
development
for
a
religious
community
that
has
shown
some
skepticism
of
trump
and
will
be
a
closely
watched
voting
demographic
in
states
such
as
arizona
o'brien
converted
from
catholicism
in
his
s
during
his
work
for
the
trump
administration
o'brien
has
divided
his
time
between
los
angeles
and
washington
maintaining
his
job
at
his
law
firm
according
to
his
firm's
website
o'brien
has
maintained
a
robust
commercial
litigation
practice
while
serving
as
a
special
presidential
envoy
the
dual
roles
have
prompted
criticism
from
some
of
the
families
of
detained
americans
who
have
pushed
for
a
swift
return
of
their
relatives
u.s.
officials
said
on
wednesday
he
also
received
praise
from
current
and
former
colleagues
including
a
former
official
in
the
barack
obama
administration
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
robertcobrien
is
a
really
really
good
person
and
that
i
wish
him
all
the
best
in
what
will
certainly
be
a
challenging
role
tweeted
andrew
exum
a
former
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
middle

policy
o'brien
has
praised
trump
for
having
unparalleled
success
in
bringing
home
hostages
including
the
release
of
pastor
andrew
brunson
in
turkey
and
other
americans
who
were
detained
in
the
middle

and
south
asia
but
his
appearance
in
sweden
in
july
to
monitor
the
trial
of
u.s.
rapper

eyebrows
as
critics
assailed

they

as
an
inappropriate

legal
matters

guilty
of

o'brien
also
has
struggled
to
make
progress
in
freeing
u.s.
detainees
there
frustrating
families
seeking
u.s.
help
o'brien's
prior
work
with
the

of

in

the
announcement
of
o'brien's
appointment
came
a
day
after
trump
publicly
named
five
finalists
for
the
position
none
of
whom
were
well-known
bolton's
ouster
last
week
ended
a
stormy
tenure
marked
by
widening
rifts
between
an
unorthodox
president
seeking
a
foreign
policy
victory
and
an
irascible
foreign
policy
hawk
who
had
been
deeply
skeptical
of
much
of
the
president's
agenda
bolton's
opposition
to
elements
of
trump's
approach
on
north
korea
iran
and
afghanistan
among
other
issues
put
him
at
odds
with
his
boss
and
other
advisers
trump
also
largely
blamed
his
third
national
security
adviser
for
overselling
the
strength
of
venezuela's
political
opposition
