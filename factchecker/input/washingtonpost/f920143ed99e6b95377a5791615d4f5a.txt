rep
joe

a
scion
of
the
democratic
political
dynasty
will
announce
his
candidacy
for
the
u.s.
senate
in
on
saturday
making
official
a
primary
challenge
to
sen
edward
j.
markey
individuals
familiar
with
kennedy's
plans
confirmed
the
coming
announcement
and
said
the
candidate
will
then
spend
several
days
on
a
statewide
tour
the
boston
globe
first
reported
the
news
the
officials
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
freely
describe
the
plans
kennedy
met
with
markey
on
wednesday
to
tell
him
in
person
a
source
said
the
matchup
between
the
men
will
mirror
some
of
the
generational
tensions
emerging
in
the
presidential
primary
in
which
younger
candidates
have
argued
that
it's
time
for
a
new
generation
of
leaders
while
kennedy
a
year-old
millennial
and
markey
a
year-old
baby
boomer
do
not
diverge
much
on
core
democratic
issues
they
present
a
distinct
choice
to
voters
about
what
they
want
the
future
of
the
party
to
look
like
yet
unlike
insurgent
primary
challenges
from
the
fringes
of
the
party
both
kennedy
and
markey
have
deep
ties
to
massachusetts
democratic
politics
and
a
competition
between
them
could
be
unsettling
for
donors
in
the
state
who
have
long
supported
both
men

kennedy
grandson
of
the
late
attorney
general
and
new
york
senator
robert
f.

has
only
been
in

since
but
his

political
legacy
in

dates
to
the
late
s
markey
has
been
in
congress
since
first
in
the
u.s.
house
and
then
in
the
senate
after
winning
a
special
election
in

y.
the
year-old
freshman
and
liberal
star
ocasio-cortez
credited
markey
who
had
already
served
in
congress
nearly
years
when
she
was
born
in
with
being
a
proud
and
strong
progressive
champion
for
working
families
and
with
leading
the
push
in
the
senate
for
green
new

climate
legislation
ed
markey
was
one
of
the
few
people
that
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
take
a
chance
she
said
since
kennedy
raised
the
specter
of
a
primary
challenge
markey
has
sought
to
burnish
his
appeal
particularly
to
liberal
voters
by
highlighting
his
long
record
on
climate
change
and
other
environmental
issues
elections
are
about
choices
and
ed
looks
forward
to
spending
the
next
months
campaigning
hard
every
day
to
show
the
people
of
the
commonwealth
why
he's
the
right
choice
from
lowering
drug
prices
for
our
seniors
to
expanding
opioid
treatment
and
recovery
services
to
creating
green
jobs
for
our
workers
ed
markey
is
ready
to
continue
the
fight
for
massachusetts
said
markey's
senior
campaign
adviser
john
walsh
in
a
statement
early
polling
in
the
state
found
kennedy
with
an
immediate
edge
over
markey
leading
the
veteran
politician
by
points
in
a
head-to-head
race
according
to
a
suffolk
university
boston
globe
poll
released
earlier
this
month
kennedy
is
buoyed
by
his
famous
last
name
but
he's
also
been
held
up
as
a
rising
star
in
the
party
having
been
picked
to
deliver
the
democrats
official
response
to
president
trump's
state
of
the
union
address
in
he
is
currently
the
only
kennedy
family
member
serving
in
congress
if
elected
to
the
senate
he'd
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
not
only
his
grandfather
but
also
more
directly
his
two
great-uncles
who
were
both
u.s.
senators
from
massachusetts
former
president
john
f.
kennedy
and
former
senator
edward
m.
kennedy
