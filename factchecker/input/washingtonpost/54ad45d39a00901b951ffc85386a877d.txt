sanders's
apples-and-oranges
comparison
on
medicare-for-all
costs
david

said
that
medicare-for-all
would
cost
over
trillion
that's

sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
remarks
during
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
sept
sanders
made
this
comment
after
former
vice
president
joe
biden
criticized
the
senator's
medicare-for-all
plan
for
potentially
adding
trillion
trillion
a
year
to
the
federal
budget
in
his
response
sanders
favorably
compared
that
trillion
to
what
he
called
the
status
quo
for
health-care
spending
trillion
he
added
every
study
done
shows
that
medicare-for-all
is
the
most
cost-effective
approach
to
providing
health
care
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
country
the
implication
was
that
medicare-for-all
would
reduce
national
health
expenditures
from
the
status
quo
when
we
queried
the
sanders
campaign
during
the
debate
for
the
source
of
the
trillion
figure
we
were
directed
to
posts
that
were
written
by
paul
waldman
for
the
washington
post's
the
plum
line
an
opinion
column
waldman
compared
a
government
projection
that
national
health
spending
would
amount
to
about
trillion
over
the
next
decade
to
an
estimate
that
projected
the
federal
cost
of
medicare-for-all
as
trillion
in
one
column
cited
by
the
campaign
waldman
wrote
so
if
medicare-for-all
actually
costs
trillion
we
would
save
trillion
hooray
waldman
told
the
fact
checker
he
has
not
read
academic
studies
that
looked
closely
at
the
impact
of
a
medicare-for-all
plan
on
national
health
expenditures
all
but
one
of
five
major
studies
from
the
left
to
the
right
predict
the
sanders
plan
would
increase
health
spending
not
reduce
it
during
our
reporting
for
this
fact
check
a
spokesman
for
the
sanders
campaign
said
it
was
not
endorsing
waldman's
analysis
but
was
simply
supplying
a
source
for
the
trillion
figure
that
sanders
cited
in
the
heat
of
the
debate
but
he
declined
repeated
queries
to
explain
the
point
sanders
was
making
with
his
comparison
we
will
try
not
to
get
too
much
in
the
weeds
but
this
debate
involves
some
big
confusing
numbers
the
trillion
figure
comes
from
an
estimate
of
national
health
expenditures
nhe
produced
by
the
centers
for
medicare
and
medicaid
services
for
the
years
to
the
over
trillion
refers
to
a
study
by
the
mercatus
center
at
george
mason
university
which
has
been
funded
by
entities
associated
with
the
koch
family
that
calculated
new
federal
spending
on
health
care
if
the
sanders
plan
were
enacted
the
number
trillion
is
often
used
but
the
study
actually
offers
a
possible
range
of
trillion
to
trillion
for
the
years
to
note
that
the
trillion
and
the
trillion
involve
different
year
time
frames
and
thus
are
not
directly
comparable
the
sanders
campaign
has
cited
this
study
to
claim
his
plan
would
lower
health-care
costs
but
the
author
charles
blahous
has
publicly
and
persistently
insisted
the
campaign
has
misinterpreted
his
findings
in
particular
he
says
the
lower-bound
estimate
is
unrealistic
because
it
assumes
sanders
would
be
successful
in
reducing
payments
for
treatments
now
covered
by
private
insurance
by
percent
roughly
speaking
there
are
two
parts
of
the
trillion
in
national
health
expenditures
that
would
be
affected
by
a
medicare-for-all
plan
trillion
in
current
government
spending
on
medicare
medicaid
obamacare
and
the
like
and
trillion
in
spending
by
households
employers
and
states
another
trillion
would
not
be
affected
medicare-for-all
would
essentially
take
over
the
state
employer
and
household
spending
so
that's
the
key
variable
using
the
same
time
frame
to
so
we
can
compare
apples
to
apples
the
status
quo
for
health
expenditures
in
the
year
period
covered
by
the
mercatus
paper
would
be
trillion
under
the
mercatus
range
of
estimates
total
health
expenditures
under
medicare-for-all
would
be
trillion
to
trillion
over
years
on
average
that's
slightly
higher
than
under
the
current
path
bottom
line
is
that
it
is
incorrect
to
say
that
the
plan
is
cheaper
than
current
law
even
on
a
national
basis
blahous
said
most
of
the
range
of
possible
outcomes
would
have
total
nhe
increasing
under
medicare-for-all
the
increase
occurs
primarily
because
of
the
increase
in
the
numbers
of
those
covered
as
well
as
in
the
generosity
of
coverage
both
of
which
would
spur
additional
demand
and
other
things
being
equal
additional
spending
the
mercatus
study
is
not
the
only
detailed
look
at
the
potential
impact
of
a
single-payer
plan
on
federal
spending
in
a
report
the
urban
institute
said
that
federal
spending
would
increase
by
about
trillion
between
and
and
national
health
expenditures
would
increase
by
trillion
on
top
of
the
status
quo
in
that
period
the
increase
in
federal
spending
is
so
large
because
the
federal
government
would
absorb
a
substantial
amount
of
current
spending
by
state
and
local
governments
employers
and
households
the
report
said
in
addition
federal
spending
would
be
needed
for
newly
covered
individuals
expanded
benefits
and
the
elimination
of
cost
sharing
for
those
insured
under
current
law
and
the
new
long-term
support
and
services
program
kenneth
thorpe
chairman
of
the
health
policy
department
at
emory
university
in
a
study
also
predicted
an
increase
in
spending
as
did
a
rand
corp
study
in
led
by
jodi
l.
liu
thorpe
a
skeptic
of
the
sanders
plan
said
he
was
surprised
when
sanders
made
the
comparison
during
the
debate
the
two
figures
are
apples
and
oranges
and
not
comparable
he
said
medicare-for-all
would
increase
the
dollars
paid
by
the
federal
government
if
private
premiums
are
largely
eliminated
and
new
taxes
are
established
to
fund
a
national
single-payer
system
liu
said
how
this
impacts
national
health
expenditures
depends
on
a
variety
of
assumptions
in
our
rand
report
we
projected
a
percent
increase
in
national
health
expenditures
if
medicare-for-all
was
implemented
in
the
new
york
times
upshot
earlier
this
year
helpfully
illustrated
the
impact
envisioned
by
the
five
studies
mercatus
urban
rand
emory
and
the
university
of
massachusetts
at
amherst
for
national
expenditures
under
medicare-for-all
compared
to
current
law
only
one
of
the
five
studies
showed
a
significant
decline
that
study
by
gerald
friedman
an
economics
professor
at
umass-amherst
found
health
spending
would
decline
over
a
year
period
from
a
baseline
of
trillion
in
health
spending
between
and
under
six
scenarios
the
most
optimistic
model
assuming
americans
shared
some
costs
with
the
government
shows
a
decline
in
spending
to
about
trillion
or
percent
but
a
model
with
no
cost-sharing
sanders's
plan
envisions
no
out-of-pocket
spending
except
for
prescription
drugs
would
have
national
health
expenditures
of
nearly
trillion
or
a
decline
of
percent
bernie
is
overstating
things
friedman
said
even
with
optimistic
assumptions
about
savings
realized
and
a
slowdown
in
growth
to
canadian
or
european
growth
rates
and
an
actuarial
value
of
percent
not
the
percent
in
his
program
spending
would
not
decline
by
trillion
or
percent
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
in
saying
that
there
will
be
financial
savings
savings
over-and-above
the
improvements
in
health
that
would
come
with
greater
access
and
improvements
in
financial
stability
with
universal
quality
insurance
the
benefits
of
medicare-for-all
are
substantial
enough
that
there
really
is
no
need
to
exaggerate
sanders
implied
during
the
debate
that
his
medicare-for-all
plan
would
reduce
health-care
spending
compared
to
the
status
quo
of
trillion
over
years
his
use
of
the
more
than
trillion
figure
might
have
led
listeners
to
assume
he
was
comparing
the
two
figures
certainly
that's
how
the
authors
of
these
studies
interpreted
these
comments
that
might
have
been
a
logical
assumption
during
the
debate
his
staff
shared
as
the
source
of
the
trillion
figure
a
pair
of
washington
post
opinion
columns
that
made
a
similar
comparison
but
a
spokesman
has
since
said
that
the
campaign
was
not
endorsing
the
analysis
in
those
columns
instead
he
says
sanders
was
simply
pointing
to
a
government
estimate
for
health
expenditures
over
a
year
period
since
the
spokesman
declined
to
explain
why
sanders
made
the
comparison
we
are
left
with
a
conundrum
it
certainly
sounded
as
if
he
was
saying
his
plan
would
reduce
health-care
spending
from
trillion
over
years
to
trillion
even
though
most
studies
predict
spending
will
increase
the
washington
post
columns
originally
cited
as
a
source
also
framed
the
issue
that
way
we
can
understand
a
misfired
talking
point
in
the
heat
of
a
debate
regular
readers
know
that
we
always
offer
the
opportunity
to
politicians
to
explain
that
he
or
she
made
an
error
and
then
we
leave
the
claim
unrated
we
don't
try
to
play
gotcha
and
simply
want
to
inform
readers
about
the
facts
for
instance
in
response
to
our
queries
about
a
fact
check
biden
recently
admitted
he
misspoke
about
his
opposition
to
the
iraq
war
similarly
we
offered
multiple
opportunities
to
the
sanders
campaign
to
explain
his
statement
or
acknowledge
an
honest
mistake
the
campaign
did
not
respond
to
that
request
on
balance
as
uttered
during
the
debate
the
statement
is
mostly
false
four
of
the
five
key
studies
on
the
impact
of
the
sanders
plan
estimate
that
national
health
expenditures
will
rise
over
years
while
the
author
of
the
fifth
predicts
a
decline
but
says
sanders's
statement
is
exaggerated
