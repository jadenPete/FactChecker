zuckerberg
andrew
harnik
ap
mark
zuckerberg
is
coming
face
to
face
with
some
of
his
top
critics
in
congress
as
he
makes
a
rare
visit
to
washington
expect
a
very
different
visit
from
zuckerberg's
last
known
trip
to
the
nation's
capital
when
the
facebook
head
testified
last
april
at
public
hearings
for
hours
this
trip
zuckerberg
will
not
be
participating
in
any
public
events
but
instead
quietly
meeting
with
lawmakers
as
his
company
and
the
tech
industry
in
general
has
come
under
increasingly
scorching
criticism
on
a
range
of
issues
from
using
their
power
inappropriately
to
insufficiently
tackling
disinformation
campaigns
and
alleged
anti-conservative
bias
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
top
tech
titan
will
still
wear
a
tie
or
have
his
famous
water
glass
tony
romm
and
i
have
confirmed
the
following
lawmakers
are
on
deck
for
meetings
with

facebook
declined
to
tell
tony
whether
zuckerberg
would
meet
with
president
trump
an
increasingly
harsh
critic
of
the
industry
today
zuckerberg
is
expected
to
meet
with
lee
and
hawley
who
has
been
aggressively
targeting
the
tech
giant
in
his
freshman
term
last
night
zuckerberg
dined
with
a
group
of
senators
at
a
dinner
warner
helped
organize
the
lead
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
warner
is
one
of
facebook's
top
critics
when
it
comes
to
election
security
and
he's
introduced
legislation
with
hawley
requiring
social
media
companies
to
tell
consumers
the
data
they're
collecting
from
them
and
its
value
the
participants
had
a
discussion
touching
on
multiple
issues
including
the
role
and
responsibility
of
social
media
platforms
in
protecting
our
democracy
and
what
steps
congress
should
take
to
defend
our
elections
protect
consumer
data
and
encourage
competition
in
the
social
media
space
rachel
cohen
a
warner
spokeswoman
told
reporters
last
night
zuckerberg
is
under
pressure
to
make
the
case
that
his
company
has
made
progress
on
those
issues
but
he's
returning
to
a
changed
political
landscape
in
washington
where
lawmakers
ire
at
the
social
media
giant
has
only
increased
as
the
election
approaches
and
many
see
self-regulation
by
silicon
valley
as
woefully
insufficient
so
in
that
spirit
zuckerberg
welcome
back
to
washington
here's
what
you
missed
while
you
were
away
antitrust
scrutiny
of
facebook
has
intensified
in
recent
months
putting
fresh
political
pressure
on
the
company's
acquisitions
of
instagram
and
whatsapp
people
ranging
from
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
to
facebook
co-founder
chris
hughes
say
it's
time
to
bust
up
the
social
network
the
federal
trade
commission
is
currently
investigating
the
company
as
well
as
are
several
states
attorneys
general
zuckerberg
has
fielded
questions
about
facebook's
size
and
power
before
but
antitrust
action
is
now
a
much
more
immediate
threat
to
the
company's
business
momentum
to
draft
federal
privacy
legislation
has
grown
following
california's
state
privacy
law
a
few
months
after
zuckerberg's
congressional
testimony
in
april
california
passed
a
new
state
privacy
law
that
goes
into
effect
next
year
industry
groups
like
the
internet
association
that
represents
facebook
have
called
for
lawmakers
to
swiftly
pass
federal
legislation
preempting
the
california
law
and
preventing
a
patchwork
of
state
regulations
from
emerging
but
democrats
and
consumer
advocates
are
wary
of
a
watered-down
national
law
supplanting
the
california
measure
zuckerberg
is
meeting
with
cantwell
one
of
the
key
players
in
the
negotiations
during
this
trip
the
privacy
debate
is
intensifying
following
a
record
billion
fine
against
facebook
which
lawmakers
criticized
as
a
slap
on
the
wrist
the
agency's
punishment
in
the
wake
of
the
cambridge
analytica
scandal
raised
questions
about
washington's
ability
to
effectively
police
silicon
valley
giants
new
misinformation
threats
have
emerged
raising
questions
about
facebook's
ability
to
police
its
platform
ahead
of
the
election
few
people
were
talking
about
deepfakes
at
the
end
of
that
is
videos
altered
with
artificial
intelligence
to
make
it
appear
people
are
saying
or
doing
things
that
never
happened
but
a
crudely
doctored
video
of
nancy
pelosi
that
went
viral
earlier
this
year
showed
how
video
can
be
a
powerful
medium
to
blast
misinformation
there's
also
a
growing
awareness
in
washington
that
facebook's
misinformation
issues
aren't
limited
to
its
flagship
service
lawmakers
are
increasingly
eying
how
facebook-owned
instagram
can
be
exploited
especially
after
a
report
prepared
for
the
senate
intelligence
committee
obtained
by
the
post
in
december
found
that
instagram
generated
more
than
twice
the
engagement
among
users
than
either
facebook
or
twitter
more
mass
shootings
have
put
a
spotlight
on
the
role
social
media
can
play
in
spurring
real-world
violence
mass
shootings
in
pittsburgh
new
zealand
california
and
texas
began
with
shooters
posting
hate-filled
screeds
on
fringe
social
media
sites
like
gab
and
chan
the
new
zealand
shootings
highlighted
how
social
media
can
play
a
role
in
amplifying
an
act
of
terror
as
the
gunman
recorded
the
shooting
on
facebook
live
and
copies
of
the
video
proliferated
on
social
media
these
incidents
have
created
more
pressure
for
social
networks
to
address
online
extremism
and
yesterday
facebook
google
and
twitter
were
grilled
by
senators
on
online
extremism
house
lawmakers
are
drafting
legislation
creating
a

the

plans
to
move
into

have
come
under
bipartisan
scrutiny
potentially
derailing

despite
its
long
list
of
problems
facebook
made
a
bold
bet
to
get
into
cryptocurrency
with
project

washington
wasn't
pleased
and
lawmakers
have
threatened
to
block
the
project
facebook
has
said
it
won't
move
forward
with
its
plans
until
it
has
addressed
those
concerns
a
very
different
strategy
for
the
company
known
for
moving
fast
and
breaking
things
accusations
of
anti-conservative
bias
have
intensified
putting
new
pressure
on
the
tech
industry's
most
important
legal
shield
president
trump
and
the
tech
giants
have
never
enjoyed
a
cozy
relationship
but
it
has
devolved
since
zuckerberg's
last
visit
to
washington
as
the
president
has
taken
to
slamming
the
tech
giants
more
frequently
on
twitter
trump
also
hosted
a
social
media
summit
at
the
white
house
earlier
this
year
where
he
did
not
invite
the
companies
but
instead
a
cast
of
conservative
provocateurs
who
have
accused
the
companies
of
anti-conservative
bias
the
companies
have
repeatedly
denied
such
a
slant
zuckerberg
plans
to
meet
hawley

earlier
this
