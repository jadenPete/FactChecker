mitch
mcconnell
wants
to
send
a
message
that
he
actually
does
support
election
security
senate
majority

at
the
capitol

the
political
pressure
to
do
something
about
election
security
appears
to
be
getting
to
senate
majority
leader
mcconnell
as
he
opened
the
senate
on
thursday
mcconnell
r-ky
made
sure
everyone
who
was
listening
knew
something
he
does
indeed
support
funding
election
security
after
weeks
of
being
derided
by
democrats
and
other
critics
as
moscow
mitch
for
blocking
a
bipartisan
election
security
bill
as
the
washington
post's
felicia
sonmez
reports
mcconnell
endorsed
million
to
go
to
states
to
help
them
combat
hacking
and
other
election
security
threats
going
into
the
election
cycle
that's
after
blocking
a
house-passed
bill
with
more
than
double
that
million
requiring
states
to
upgrade
their
aging
voting
machines
and
make
them
less
susceptible
to
russian
hacking
i'm
proud
the
financial
services
and
the
general
government
bill
included
a
bipartisan
amendment
providing
another
million
from
the
administration
to
help
states
improve
their
defenses
and
shore
up
their
voting
systems
mcconnell
said
i'm
proud
to
have
helped
develop
this
amendment
and
co-sponsor
it
in
committee
when
it
comes
to
election
security
mcconnell
has
been
in
a
tough
place
politically
he
could
pass
the
major
election
security
bill
and
risk
upsetting
president
trump
or
block
the
bill
and
see
what
happens
but
the
political
fallout
from
blocking
the
bill
may
have
been
more
than
he
was
expecting
mcconnell
didn't
have
to
announce
this
funding
thursday
which
cleared
a
key
committee
that
morning
but
it's
notable
that
he
did
why
is
election
security
such
a
politicized
issue
in
the
first
place
because
of
trump
he
has
difficulty
acknowledging
what
intelligence
agencies
and
the
mueller
report
concluded
that
russians
interfered
in
the
u.s.
election
to
try
to
help
him
win
and
they
went
beyond
pushing
fake
news
on
social
media
or
hacking
into
democrats
emails
a
bipartisan
senate
report
found
russians
tried
to
hack
voting
machines
in
all
states
in
trump
has
largely
refused
to
acknowledge
all
this
has
been
deferential
to
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
it
and
is
so
sensitive
to
talking
about
it
that
a
cabinet
secretary
was
warned
against
briefing
him
on
it
it
seems
likely
that
mcconnell
didn't
want
to
get
in
the
middle
of
that
so
this
summer
when
congress
was
about
to
go
on
recess
and
democrats
tried
to
bring
up
this
election
security
bill
he
interjected
and
stopped
it
from
moving
forward
mcconnell
said
at
the
time
that
the
federal
government
was
already
working
with
states
to
address
election
interference
and
that
passing
more
legislation
would
be
too
heavy-handed
since
states
run
their
own
elections
most
but
not
all
of
his
caucus
agreed
with
his
position
some
of
my
colleagues
see
this
as
a
first
step
to
nationalizing
elections
sen
john
neely
kennedy
r-la
who
chairs
a
key
subcommittee
on
all
this
said
tuesday
about
why
republicans
oppose
giving
a
significant
amount
of
money
to
pad
states
efforts
to
prevent
hacking
now
mcconnell
is
saying
it
was
this
million
coming
through
a
republican-controlled
senate
that
he
preferred
all
along
election
security
experts
with
whom
the
fix
spoke
in
july
warned
that
a
couple
hundred
million
is
not
enough
to
protect
americans
voting
systems
from
a
threat
that
trump's
own
head
of
the
fbi
warns
is
coming
in
the
russians
are
absolutely
intent
on
trying
to
interfere
with
our
elections
fbi
director
christopher
a.
wray
testified
to
senators
in
july
the
house
bill
which
passed
with
one
republican
vote
does
some
basic
things
to
protect
u.s.
elections
said
suzanne
spaulding
who
was
an
undersecretary
at
the
department
of
homeland
security
under
president
barack
obama
it's
a
package
of
bills
that
tries
to
address
disinformation
campaigns
on
social
media
and
ties
about
million
in
funding
for
new
election
systems
in
the
states
to
requirements
that
they
upgrade
their
equipment
to
make
sure
they
are
less
hackable
but
the
perception
that
voting
machines
are
safe
matters
spaulding
said
that's
important
to
make
sure
our
elections
are
secure
she
said
in
july
but
what's
critically
important
is
we
have
a
way
of
assuring
the
public
that
their
vote
was
counted
as
cast
when
mcconnell
blocked
the
legislation
it
became
a
national
story
perhaps
more
than
he
was
expecting
leading
into
the
midterm
elections
senate
republicans
blocked
an
election
security
measure
without
nearly
as
much
fanfare
but
when
criticism
did
start
to
pick
up
mcconnell
got
the
support
from
trump
he
ostensibly
bargained
for
a
washington
post
columnist
labeled
mcconnell
a
russian
asset
and
mcconnell
responded
on
the
senate
floor
that
he
was
the
target
of
modern-day
mccarthyism
trump
jumped
in
and
backed
up
mcconnell
i
think
the
washington
post
is
a
russian
asset
by
comparison
trump
told
reporters
mitch
mcconnell
loves
our
country
he's
done
a
great
job
those
are
nice
words
to
hear
when
you're
mcconnell
and
are
up
for
reelection
next
year
in
a
pro-trump
state
his
democratic
challenger
amy
mcgrath
is
raising
tons
of
money
but
has
an
uphill
climb
to
unseat
him
but
after
weeks
of
moscow
mitch
being
a
thing
it
appears
trump's
support
wasn't
enough
for
mcconnell
to
hold
off
on
all
election
security
bills
and
he
wanted
us
to
know
about
it
