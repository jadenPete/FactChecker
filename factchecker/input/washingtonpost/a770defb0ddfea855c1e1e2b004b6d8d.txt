a
divided
fed
reduces
rates
but
may
not
cut
again

year
federal
reserve
board
chair
jerome

speaks
at
a

conference
following
a
two-day
meeting
of
the
federal

committee

washington
a
sharply
divided
federal
reserve
cut
its
benchmark
interest
rate
wednesday
for
a
second
time
this
year
but
declined
to
signal
that
further
rate
cuts
are
likely
this
year
the
fed's
move
reduced
its
key
short-term
rate
which
influences
many
consumer
and
business
loans
by
an
additional
quarter-point
to
a
range
of
to
the
action
was
approved
with
two
officials
preferring
to
keep
rates
unchanged
and
one
arguing
for
a
bigger
half-point
cut
the
divisions
on
the
policy
committee
underscored
the
challenges
for
chairman
jerome
powell
in
guiding
the
fed
at
a
time
of
high
economic
uncertainty
the
fed
did
leave
the
door
open
to
additional
rate
cuts
if
as
powell
suggested
at
a
news
conference
the
economy
weakens
for
now
he
suggested
the
economic
expansion
appears
durable
in
its
th
year
with
a
still-solid
job
market
and
steady
consumer
spending
at
the
same
time
the
fed
is
trying
to
combat
threats
including
uncertainties
caused
by
president
donald
trump's
trade
war
with
china
slower
global
growth
and
a
slump
in
american
manufacturing
the
fed
noted
in
its
statement
that
business
investment
and
exports
have
weakened
financial
markets
closed
mostly
higher
after
the
fed's
afternoon
announcement
although
the
diverging
opinions
on
the
fed
left
some
investors
uncertain
how
many
more
rate
cuts
the
fed
will
deliver
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
after
being
down
most
of
the
day
finished
up
points
or
to
at
his
news
conference
powell
acknowledged
that
fed
officials
are
sharply
divided
about
the
wisest
course
for
interest
rates
especially
given
uncertainties
like
trade
conflicts
whose
outcomes
are
out
of
the
fed's
control
this
is
a
time
of
difficult
judgments
and
disparate
perspectives
the
chairman
said
in
any
case
many
business
leaders
are
skeptical
that
the
fed's
slight
rate
cuts
will
deliver
much
economic
benefit
wednesday's
rate
cut
makes
virtually
no
difference
to
the
u.s.
economy
in
and
of
itself
said
jamie
dimon
ceo
of
jpmorgan
chase
who
suggested
as
many
corporate
leaders
have
that
trump's
trade
war
remains
an
overarching
threat
i
don't
think
cutting
rates
will
offset
trade
personally
said
dimon
head
of
the
largest
u.s.
bank
among
powell's
challenges
is
that
the
trade
war's
uncertainties
are
likely
affecting
the
nation's
economic
data
making
it
hard
for
the
fed
to
set
an
interest-rate
policy
for
the
months
ahead
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
commit
to
a
path
of
policy
today
when
monetary
policy
is
now
responding
to
future
developments
in
the
trade
policy
said
bill
adams
a
senior
economist
at
pnc
financial
services
wednesday's
modest
rate
cut
irritated
trump
who
has
attacked
the
central
bank
and
insisted
that
it
slash
rates
more
aggressively
the
president
immediately
signaled
his
discontent
jay
powell
and
the
federal
reserve
fail
again
trump
tweeted
no
guts
no
sense
no
vision
a
terrible
communicator
asked
about
trump's
latest
personal
taunt
powell
declined
as
he
has
before
to
respond
directly
while
adding
that
the
fed's
long-standing
independence
from
political
pressures
has
served
the
public
well
updated
economic
and
interest
rate
forecasts
issued
wednesday
by
the
fed
show
that
only
seven
of
officials
foresee
at
least
one
additional
rate
cut
this
year
and
at
least
two
fed
officials
expect
a
rate
hike
next
year
none
of
the
policymakers
foresee
rates
falling
below
in
a
sign
that
the
turbulence
from
a
global
slowdown
and
trump's
escalation
of
the
trade
war
is
viewed
as
manageable
the
median
forecasts
show
the
economy
is
expected
to
grow
a
modest
this
year
next
year
and
in
those
forecasts
are
well
below
the
trump
administration's
projection
that
the
president's
policies
will
accelerate
growth
to
annually
or
better
but
they
also
suggest
that
policymakers
do
not
envision
a
recession
unemployment
is
projected
to
be
and
inflation
below
the
fed's
target
level
of
a
resumption
of
trade
talks
between
the
trump
administration
and
beijing
and
a
less
antagonistic
tone
between
the
two
sides
have
supported
the
view
that
additional
rate
cuts
might
not
be
necessary
so
has
a
belief
that
oil
prices
will
remain
elevated
that
inflation
might
finally
be
reaching
the
fed's
target
level
and
that
there
are
increasing
signs
that
the
u.s.
economy
remains
sturdy
the
job
market
looks
solid
wages
are
rising
consumers
are
still
spending
and
even
such
sluggish
sectors
as
manufacturing
and
construction
have
shown
signs
of
rebounding
yet
no
one
perhaps
not
even
the
fed
is
sure
of
how
interest
rate
policy
will
unfold
in
coming
months
too
many
uncertainties
exist
notably
the
outcome
of
trump's
trade
war
trump
has
meantime
kept
up
a
stream
of
public
attacks
on
the
central
bank's
policymaking
including
referring
to
powell
as
an
enemy
and
the
fed's
policymakers
as
boneheads
even
though
the
economy
looks
resilient
the
president
has
insisted
that
the
fed
slash
its
benchmark
rate
more
deeply
even
to
below
zero
as
the
european
central
bank
has
done
part
to
weaken
the
u.s.
dollar
and
make
american
exports
more
competitive
the
fed
is
monitoring
the
global
slowdown
especially
in
europe
and
britain's
effort
to
leave
the
european
union
a
disruptive
brexit
could
destabilize
not
just
europe
but
the
u.s.
economy
too
u.s.
inflation
which
has
long
been
dormant
has
begun
to
show
signs
that
it
is
reaching
the
fed's
percent
target
and
might
remain
there
if
the
fed's
policymakers
conclude
that
inflation
will
sustain
a
faster
pace
it
might
give
them
pause
about
cutting
rates
much
further
the
most
serious
threat
to
the
expansion
is
widely
seen
as
trump's
trade
war
the
increased
import
taxes
he
has
imposed
on
goods
from
china
and
europe
and
the
counter-tariffs
other
nations
have
applied
to
u.s.
exports
have
hurt
many
american
companies
and
paralyzed
their
plans
for
investment
and
expansion
in
recent
days
the
trump
administration
and
beijing
have
acted
to
de-escalate
tensions
before
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
planned
for
october
in
washington
yet
most
analysts
foresee
no
significant
agreement
emerging
this
fall
in
the
conflict
