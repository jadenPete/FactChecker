president
donald
trump
on
wednesday
named
robert
o'brien
his
chief
hostage
negotiator
and
an
established
figure
in
republican
policy
circles
as
his
new
national
security
adviser
o'brien
the
fourth
person
in
two
years
to
hold
the
job
becomes
the
administration's
point
person
on
national
security
amid
rising
tensions
with
iran
following
the
weekend
attack
on
saudi
oil
installations
and
fresh
uncertainty
in
afghanistan
after
the
halt
in
peace
talks
with
the
taliban
the
announcement
of
o'brien's
selection
comes
a
week
after
trump
ousted
john
bolton
from
the
post
citing
policy
disagreements
o'brien
who
made
headlines
in
july
when
he
was
dispatched
to
sweden
to
monitor
the
assault
trial
of
american
rapper
a
ap
rocky
was
among
five
candidates
trump
said
tuesday
were
under
consideration
he's
worked
with
me
for
quite
awhile
now
on
hostages
and
we
have
a
tremendous
track
record
on
hostages
trump
said
wednesday
on
a
tarmac
in
los
angeles
hours
after
revealing
the
pick
on
twitter
robert
has
been
fantastic
we
know
each
other
well
o'brien
standing
alongside
trump
said
it
was
a
privilege
to
be
picked
we've
had
tremendous
foreign
policy
successes
under
president
trump's
leadership
i
expect
those
to
continue
we've
got
a
number
of
challenges
he
added
o'brien
said
the
administration's
focus
will
continue
to
be
on
keeping
the
u.s.
safe
and
rebuilding
the
military
he
said
he
would
advise
trump
privately
on
the
situation
in
saudi
arabia
trump
abruptly
forced
out
bolton
on
sept
after
he
and
his
hawkish
national
security
adviser
found
themselves
in
strong
disagreement
over
the
administration's
approach
to
iran
afghanistan
and
a
host
of
other
global
challenges
the
sudden
exit
marked
the
latest
departure
of
a
prominent
voice
of
dissent
from
trump's
inner
circle
as
the
president
has
grown
more
comfortable
following
his
gut
instinct
over
the
studious
guidance
offered
by
his
advisers
former
missouri
sen
jim
talent
who
has
been
a
friend
of
o'brien's
for
years
said
that
while
he
is
tough
has
a
high
degree
of
stamina
and
doesn't
fold
under
pressure
he
is
not
the
type
of
person
who
is
going
to
try
to
steamroll
his
own
policy
opinions
he
does
not
have
the
brand
of
bolton
talent
said
adding
that
it
would
be
hard
to
pigeonhole
o'brien
as
a
neo-con
or
label
him
with
other
foreign
policy
tags
talent
said
o'brien
formerly
arbitrated
international
legal
cases
and
probably
wore
a
tie
more
often
than
others
in
los
angeles
but
he's
not
a
buttoned-up
kind
of
person
talent
said
as
the
special
presidential
envoy
for
hostage
affairs
at
the
state
department
o'brien
worked
closely
with
the
families
of
american
hostages

advised
administration

helped
secure
the
release
in

who
was
freed
after

in
captivity
in
yemen
he
has
also
worked
on
the
case
of
missing
u.s.
journalist
austin
tice
who
was
captured
in
syria
in
o'brien
has
said
the
u.s.
is
confident
tice
is
still
alive
the
white
house
sent
o'brien
to
sweden
to
monitor
the
case
of
a
ap
rocky
who
was
charged
with
assault
the
rapper

real
name
is
rakim

student
detained
in
iran
told
reporters
that
she
would
like
to
see
the
same
level
of
personal
attention
from
the
government
as
a
ap

on
wednesday
a
twitter
account
that
advocates
for
the
release
of
the
student
xiyue
wang
congratulated
o'brien
on
the

also
said

all
its
energies
into
releasing
celebrity
