most
americans
are
at
least
somewhat
confident
that
the
world
will
step
up
in
its
fight
against
global
warming
but
there
are
limits
to
their
optimism
that's
according
to
a
new
poll
by
the
associated
press-norc
center
for
public
affairs
research
that
also
shows
most
think
their
own
actions
can
make
a
difference
about
in
americans
think
it
is
at
least
moderately
likely
the
world
will
take
action
in
the
next
decade
to
reduce
emissions
of
heat-trapping
carbon
dioxide
and
other
gases
but
only
about
in
think
that's
very
likely
to
happen
according
to
the
august
poll
two-thirds
of
those
polled
said
they
think
pollution
reduction
would
have
at
least
some
impact
in
preventing
future
warming
but
only
about
a
quarter
think
it
would
do
a
lot
to
keep
climate
change
at
bay
about
in
americans
overall
think
even
if
emissions
are
cut
back
significantly
it
will
do
little
or
nothing
to
stop
climate
change
i
worry
for
my
children
and
my
grandchildren
and
for
the
future
and
what
they
have
in
store
for
them
said
vickie
jackson
of
aydlett
north
carolina
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
get
any
better
unfortunately
it
would
take
everybody
to
really
pitch
in
and
really
care
michael
mann
a
prominent
pennsylvania
state
university
climate
scientist
who
has
been
labeled
an
alarmist
by
people
who
reject
mainstream
climate
science
sees
it
a
bit
differently
i'm
cautiously
optimistic
that
we
will
take
the
actions
necessary
to
avert
catastrophic
warming
mann
said
in
an
email
however
these
poll
results
also
show
that
one
of
the
greatest
threats
to
action
now
isn't
outright
denial
it's
hopelessness
and
despair
and
a
growing
sense
in
some
communities
that
we
have
no
agency
in
addressing
this
challenge
democrats
and
younger
people
show
a
bit
more
optimism
than
republicans
and
older
americans
eight
in
democrats
say
reducing
carbon
pollution
in
the
next
decade
would
help
prevent
additional
global
warming
about
half
of
republicans
say
emission
cuts
would
have
little
or
no
impact
about
three-quarters
of
those
under
say
pollution
cuts
could
prevent
future
warming
compared
with
about
in
of
those
and
older
ann
florence
of
jonesborough
tennessee
said
she's
not
optimistic
the
government
especially
the
trump
administration
will
tackle
climate
change
but
she
has
more
hope
when
it
comes
to
everyday
people
it's
got
to
start
from
the
bottom
up
she
said
if
i
take
care
of
my
carbon
footprint
i'm
helping
someone
in
future
generations
scientists
say
individual
actions
do
matter
especially
if
those
actions
are
combined
with
changes
across
the
globe
when
it
comes
to
climate
change
most
americans
have
big
worries
about
air
quality
plant
and
animal
life
drinking
water
supply
human
health
and
rising
sea
levels
but
what
they
say
they
are
most
concerned
about
is
future
generations
while
of
americans
say
they're
very
or
extremely
concerned
about
climate
change's
effects
on
them
personally
two-thirds
say
they
are
very
or
extremely
concerned
about
future
generations
chris
dennis
a
year-old
nurse
from
greenville
south
carolina
said
he
worries
about
his
children
but
he
also
thinks
their
generation
will
do
more
to
solve
the
problem
than
his
jonathan
overpeck
dean
of
environment
at
the
university
of
michigan
said
the
next
generation
is
key
we
have
a
stark
choice
leave
them
a
world
being
destroyed
by
fossil
fuels
or
a
world
that
is
more
sustainable
just
and
powered
by
clean
energy
overpeck
said
the
world's
youth
understand
this
and
are
making
sure
we
all
understand
it
their
activism
is
making
a
real
difference
brett
kelso
a
year-old
libertarian-leaning
independent
who
lives
in
lincoln
city
oregon
knows
a
rising
pacific
ocean
may
destroy
part
of
his
town
but
he's
not
too
worried
about
the
long-term
climate
picture
human
beings
as
a
species
have
been
very
adaptable
creatures
said
kelso
who
is
too
busy
raising
a
year-old
and

while
also
working
as
a

nasa
climate

kate
marvel
said
it's
hard
to
predict
the
future
but
we
can
all
shape
the
future
we
want
she
added
we're
not
passive
and
we're
not
helpless
i
think
we
can
be
optimistic
but
we
have
to
earn
that
optimism
