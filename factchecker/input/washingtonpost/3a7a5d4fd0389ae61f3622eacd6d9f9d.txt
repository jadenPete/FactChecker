attorney

at
the
white
house
patrick
semansky
associated
press
a
leaked
document
outlining
one
trump
administration
proposal
to
expand
background
checks
on
firearms
sales
prompted
an
uproar
from
the
right
on
wednesday
underscoring
the
significant
challenges
the
white
house
will
face
on
any
additional
gun
restrictions
it
tries
to
advance
in
congress
the
national
rifle
association
weakened
but
still
influential
among
conservatives
immediately
dismissed
the
plan
drafted
by
the
justice
department
as
a
non-starter
a
white
house
spokesman
denied
that
the
document
was
a
white
house
product
even
though
its
top
legislative
official
was
briefing
gop
senators
on
the
plan's
details
many
republicans
who
reviewed
the
specifics
of
the
background
checks
measure
remained
lukewarm
about
it
and
a
handful
of
gop
senators
who
had
been
directly
briefed
by
attorney
general
william
p.
barr
on
the
plan
acknowledged
that
the
proposal
was
incomplete
at
best
i
don't
know
who
leaked
it
said
sen
john
cornyn
r-tex
who
discussed
the
proposal
with
barr
on
tuesday
but
obviously
that
wasn't
the
idea
for
weeks
president
trump
has
publicly
vowed
to
advance
a
package
of
ideas
to
reduce
gun
violence
as
mass
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
galvanized
public
support
for
new
restrictions
and
pressure
mounted
on
capitol
hill
to
pass
substantive
legislation
addressing
the
issue
the
administration
led
by
barr
and
eric
ueland
the
white
house's
director
of
legislative
affairs
began
circulating
a
one-page
document
on
capitol
hill
this
week
outlining
a
new
requirement
for
background
checks
on
all
advertised
commercial
gun
sales
the
plan
was
first
reported
by
the
daily
caller
a
conservative
news
website
after
the
plan
became
public
the
white
house
immediately
distanced
itself
trump
who
has
waffled
publicly
and
in
private
on
various
firearms
restrictions
has
not
endorsed
any
one
proposal
a
white
house
spokesman
said
that
is
not
a
white
house
document
said
the
spokesman
hogan
gidley
referring
to
the
justice
department
plan
any
suggestion
to
the
contrary
is
completely
false
barr
who
returned
to
capitol
hill
on
wednesday
to
continue
briefing
senators
on
the
proposal
said
in
brief
remarks
to
reporters
that
he
was
just
kicking
around
some
ideas
in
his
meetings
this
week
he
declined
to
get
into
specifics
saying
simply
there
are
a
number
of
proposals
being
considered
but
the
plan
drew
immediate
opposition
from
the
nra
where
officials
were
privately
unhappy
wednesday
after
they
reviewed
the
memo
and
expressed
concern
about
the
white
house's
handling
of
the
talks
according
to
one
top
nra
executive
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
that
concern
was
quickly
relayed
to
allies
on
capitol
hill
according
to
the
executive
who
said
the
outline
reads
like
a
pathway
to
gun
registration
and
confirms
their
worst
fears
this
missive
is
a
non-starter
with
the
nra
and
our
million
members
because
it
burdens
law-abiding
gun
owners
while
ignoring
what
actually
matters
fixing
the
broken
mental
health
system
and
the
prosecution
of
violent
criminals
said
jason
ouimet
executive
director
of
the
nra's
institute
for
legislative
action
even
before
details
began
to
emerge
this
week
congressional
republicans
had
been
struggling
to
unite
behind
a
firearms
plan
particularly
with
little
direction
from
the
mercurial
trump
when
it
came
to
what
kind
of
gun
measures
he
would
endorse
one
senior
white
house
official
said
public
rollout
of
a
guns
package
was
unlikely
this
week
because
of
dissension
within
the
administration
white
house
prepares
gun
proposals
but
where
trump
stands
is
unclear
although
it
was
drafted
with
some
white
house
input
the
background
check
proposal
surprised
key
white
house
officials
including
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
who
was
traveling
with
the
president
on
the
west
coast
and
not
involved
in
writing
the
memo
said
a
senior
administration
official
trump's
conservatives
allies
have
told
him
that
he
would
never
get
credit
for
toughening
gun
laws
no
matter
what
he
does
and
that
endorsing
additional
gun
restrictions
would
only
depress
enthusiasm
among
his
core
base
of
voters
according
to
two
white
house
officials
meanwhile
ivanka
trump
the
president's
daughter
and
a
white
house
senior
adviser
has
been
the
biggest
force
within
the
administration
lobbying
for
a
plan
that
would
expand
background
checks
according
to
a
white
house
official
familiar
with
the
internal
dynamics
prompting
fears
from
elsewhere
in
the
white
house
that
the
president
himself
would
go
for
it
because
she
is
pushing
it
the
white
house
officials
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
freely
discuss
private
deliberations
a
broad
swath
of
republican
senators
also
hail
from
rural
states
where
the
culture
of
gun
ownership
runs
deep
and
where
voters
are
averse
to
any
measure
that
would
be
seen
as
infringing
on
second
amendment
rights
sen
kevin
cramer
r-n
d.
said
the
proposal
that
was
being
pitched
by
the
administration
appeared
similar
to
legislation
drafted
by
sens
patrick
j.
toomey
r-pa
and
joe
manchin
iii
d-w
va
in
that
failed
to
advance
in
a
senate
controlled
by
democrats
expanding
background
checks
has
always
been
viewed
by
a
lot
of
our
constituents
my
constituents
as
a
slippery
slope
and
probably
something
that's
not
all
that
helpful
cramer
said
i
think
most
people
i
know
in
north
dakota
anyway
prefer
dealing
with
existing
law
and
enforcing
it
better
sen
josh
hawley
r-mo
a
favorite
of
the
right
who
also
met
with
barr
earlier
this
week
declined
to
take
a
position
on
the
administration's
proposal
and
also
cautioned
that
the
plan
was
premature
my
question
to
the
attorney
general
on
tuesday
was
what
is
the
president
going
to
support
what
is
the
president
going
to
put
forward
hawley
said
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
yet
the
lack
of
enthusiasm
on
the
right
didn't
mean
democrats
were
on
board
either
it
is
strange
to
be
shopping
a
proposal
that
doesn't
have
the
president's
imprimatur
said
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
one
of
the
most
prominent
advocates
of
gun
control
in
congress
he
said
he
had
yet
to
endorse
or
oppose
the
plan
drafted
by
barr
the
two
senators
who
appeared
even
remotely
warm
to
the
administration's
offer
were
manchin
and
toomey
who
along
with
murphy
met
privately
with
barr
in
toomey's
office
on
capitol
hill
later
wednesday
still
the
three
men
each
of
whom
has
spoken
with
the
president
repeatedly
in
recent
weeks
cautioned
that
nothing
had
been
finalized
i
think
he
has
advanced
some
ideas
that
are
very
constructive
very
thoughtful
and
could
go
a
long
way
toward
expanding
background
checks
in
a
way
that
poses
absolutely
minimal
inconvenience
on
law-abiding
citizens
and
increases
the
chances
that
we
would
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
who
shouldn't
have
them
toomey
said
i
think
there's
some
details
that
still
need
to
be
worked
out
waiting
for
trump
congress
remains
at
loggerheads
on
gun
legislation
yet
whatever
is
finalized
among
senators
may
fall
short
in
the
democratic-led
house
where
the
leadership
had
demanded
nothing
short
of
a
universal
background
checks
bill
that
passed
earlier
this
year
but
faces
a
veto
threat
from
the
white
house
rep
mike
thompson
d-calif
chairman
of
house
gun
violence
prevention
task
force
said
he
would
review
the
administration's
plan
but
noted
that
trump
has
flirted
with
embracing
expanded
background
checks
only
to
back
away
ueland
speaking
to
reporters
on
capitol
hill
dismissed
such
criticism
i
don't
put
any
credence
in
that
at
all
he
said
in
fact
it's
important
for
people
to
realize
that
this
president
is
open
to
and
seeks
input
across
a
wide
array
of
perspectives
as
he
comes
to
conclusions
about
policy
decisions
which
you
all
witness
cover
talk
about
on
television
put
in
print
and
tweet
about
nonstop
when
asked
who
drafted
the
memorandum
ueland
just
laughed
