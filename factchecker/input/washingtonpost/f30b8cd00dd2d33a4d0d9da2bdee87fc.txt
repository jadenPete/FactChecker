democratic
debate
hosted
in

david

ap
sen
kamala
d.
harris
sliding
steadily
in
the
polls
dropping
behind
at
least
three
of
her
rivals
and
largely
absent
from
the
campaign
trail
in
recent
weeks
is
moving
her
chips
to
iowa
betting
the
first-in-the-nation
state
can
widen
a
narrowing
path
to
the
democratic
nomination
her
campaign
on
thursday
announced
the
hiring
of
full-time
organizers
in
the
state
nearly
doubling
its
staff
there
by
the
beginning
of
october
and
harris
will
be
visiting
iowa
every
week
for
the
next
month
we
want
to
be
in
to
make
sure
that
we
have
a
strong
top-three
finish
campaign
manager
juan
rodriguez
said
of
the
feb
iowa
caucuses
when
democrats
will
cast
the
first
votes
of
the
primary
season
i
think
that
will
kind
of
continue
to
give
us
a
slingshot
to
go
into
that
early
primaries
day
calendar
the
pivot
comes
as
sen
elizabeth
warren
mass
continues
to
rise
nationally
and
as
harris
and
other
candidates
struggle
to
dent
the
strength
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
in
the
polls
many
democrats
believed
his
support
would
start
to
fade
and
his
continued
strength
is
leaving
less
room
for
other
candidates
to
elbow
their
way
into
contention
forcing
some
to
reconsider
their
approach
harris's
moves
also
come
at
a
critical
moment
in
the
campaign
calendar
less
than
five
months
remain
until
voting
begins
not
much
time
for
an
assault
on
the
commanding
position
of
biden
warren
or
sen
bernie
sanders
vt
the
third-quarter
fundraising
period
ends
sept
and
a
weak
showing
could
damage
several
of
the
hopefuls
for
harris
the
renewed
iowa
focus
suggests
her
strategists
who
once
felt
she
had
many
paths
to
the
nomination
are
seeing
those
options
dwindle
south
carolina
for
example
was
initially
viewed
as
a
promising
target
for
harris
who
could
then
use
her
momentum
to
vault
into
the
rest
of
the
primary
season
but
biden
holds
a
persistent
lead
in
the
state
where
he
benefits
from
the
loyalty
of
many
black
voters
harris's
plan
for
frequent
iowa
appearances
will
not
preclude
efforts
in
south
carolina
where
she
will
also
campaign
this
weekend
but
it
does
represent
a
major
pivot
for
harris
who
spent
most
of
the
last
months
crisscrossing
the
country
to
big-dollar
fundraisers
to
the
exclusion
of
more
regular
campaigning
although
her
campaign
was
the
first
to
buy
television
ads
in
iowa
and
she
staged
a
five-day
bus
tour
there
in
august
harris
had
not
campaigned
in
iowa
in
five
weeks
as
of
thursday
morning
a
longer
drought
than
any
of
the
leading
candidates
harris
a
senator
from
california
has
also
been
scarce
recently
in
other
early
primary
states
like
new
hampshire
where
she's
appeared
once
in
the
last
two
months
and
south
carolina
which
she
has
not
visited
in
more
than
two
months
rodriguez
said
those
omissions
were
strategic
the
campaign
he
said
believed
the
candidate
should
be
fundraising
rather
than
retail
politicking
so
she
could
build
the
necessary
resources
to
spread
her
message
in
iowa
and
other
early
states
but
harris
has
struggled
to
turn
her
attention-grabbing
campaign
launch
into
consistent
momentum
early
on
campaign
staff
and
advisers
argued
that
her
main
problem
was
name
identification
since
fewer
people
knew
her
than
biden
sanders
or
warren
as
soon
as
she
got
herself
out
on
the
campaign
trail
they
said
she'd
catch
up
in
the
polls
but
harris
has
not
been
in
front
of
early-state
voters
as
much
as
the
other
candidates
and
now
harris's
donors
are
increasingly
concerned
about
her
prospects
while
the
campaign
is
seeking
to
dampen
expectations
for
fundraising
in
the
year's
third
quarter
she
has
consistently
been
in
the
top
four
or
five
in
the
polls
but
with
the
acknowledgment
that
we've
got
to
get
her
out
there
more
said
harris
communications
director
lily
adams
that's
the
purpose
of
getting
her
out
there
in
october
spending
half
the
month
or
so
in
iowa
making
sure
we're
there
every
week
still
a
top-three
finish
in
iowa
let
alone
a
nationwide
comeback
will
not
come
easily
an
iowa
poll
released
this
week
conducted
by
longtime
harris
pollster
david
binder
for
focus
on
rural
america
found
harris
at
five
percent
in
the
state
trailing
not
only
biden
warren
and
sanders
but
also
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
and
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
the
poll
showed
harris
slipping
points
from
where
she
stood
after
staging
an
emotional
attack
on
biden
in
the
first
democratic
debate
after
which
harris
described
herself
as
a
top-tier
candidate
asked
on
thursday
about
that
drop
in
polls
adams
said
the
campaign
never
believed
the
earlier
polling
spike
would
last
referring
to
it
as
a
sugar
high
but
the
unspoken
challenge
for
harris
as
well
as
other
democrats
is
biden's
durability
as
harris
advisers
and
allies
acknowledge
privately
despite
attacks
from
his
rivals
multiple
gaffes
and
questions
about
his
age
and
record
biden
has
maintained
his
spot
atop
virtually
all
state
and
national
polls
harris's
advisers
have
long
seen
biden
as
the
rival
she
needs
to
beat
particularly
when
it
comes
to
african
american
voters
but
so
far
she
been
unable
to
dislodge
or
put
a
visible
dent
in
biden's
prospects
in
iowa
south
carolina
or
elsewhere
her
campaign
has
demonstrated
a
belief
as
evidenced
in
part
by
her
strategy
in
the
first
two
debates
that
harris
can
pry
voters
away
from
the
former
vice
president
particularly
if
he
falters
if
he
doesn't
she
will
not
be
the
only
hopeful
whose
path
to
the
nomination
will
taper
i
don't
know
what
their
plan
is
to
maintain
that
durability
adams
said
of
biden
our
strategy
is
going
to
be
to
get
harris
out
there
more
and
make
sure
that
she's
like
right
up
in
people's
face
when
they're
making
that
decision
even
so
harris
has
faced
ongoing
questions
about
her
central
message
and
reason
for
running
something
many
voters
have
said
she
has
not
made
as
clear
as
some
competitors
have
while
biden
warren
and
sanders
have
long-established
political
identities
biden
pitching
himself
as
a
return
to
normalcy
warren
advocating
structural
change
and
sanders
pushing
a
revolution
harris
entered
the
campaign
without
an
easy-to-sum-up
pitch
and
has
yet
to
establish
one
in
the
last
debate
harris
often
looked
directly
at
the
camera
and
challenged
president
trump
rather
than
her
democratic
rivals
something
her
advisers
say
reflects
her
argument
that
the
former
california
attorney
general
is
the
best
candidate
to
prosecute
the
case
against
four
more
years
of
donald
trump
harris
has
also
touted
and
spent
her
iowa
advertising
dollars
explaining
a
a
m
agenda
her
plan
to
address
the
issues
that
keep
americans
up
at
night
she's
sought
to
position
herself
between
biden
on
the
one
hand
and
the
liberal
warren
and
sanders
on
the
other
as
a
problem-solving
candidate
who
favors
big
change
but
will
take
practical
steps
to
achieve
it
on
thursday
adams
took
not-so-veiled
shots
at
those
rivals
we
have
obviously
a
candidate
who's
saying
we
should
just
look
back
to
the
way
things
were
but
i
think
that
going
back
is
not
usually
how
democrats
conducted
campaigns
she
said
in
a
reference
to
biden
on
the
other
hand
adams
said
i
think
there
are
far
more
ideological
strict
ideological
candidates
who
i
believe
will
contribute
to
the
partisan
rancor
that
we've
seen
and
watched
it
for
a
long
time
harris
intends
to
position
herself
between
those
two
camps
during
the
next
stage
of
her
campaign
beginning
thursday
night
in
coralville
iowa
i'm
f-
ing
moving
to
iowa
harris
told
sen
mazie
hirono
d-hawaii
on
wednesday
pithily
summing
up
her
strategy
inadvertently
within
earshot
of
reporter
matt
laslo
the
question
is
how
many
voters
in
iowa
will
move
to
her
