washington
a
peculiar
thing
is
happening
in
financial
markets
this
week
a
corner
of
the
financial
system
where
banks
and
others
go
for
billions
of
dollars
in
short-term
loans
is
suddenly
in
need
of
cash
to
that
end
the
federal
reserve
has
stepped
in
to
inject
about
billion
into
the
market
over
the
past
three
days
with
plans
for
another
billion
on
friday
the
fed
took
action
after
interest
rates
spiked
in
a
market
for
funds
known
as
the
repo
market
while
there
was
similar
turbulence
in
the
repo
market
in
the
period
leading
up
to
the
financial
crisis
economists
say
there's
no
need
to
worry
the
financial
system
isn't
going
to
seize
up
like
it
did
in
this
marks
the
fed's
first
major
operation
in
the
repo
market
since
the
crisis
the
repo
market
describes
billions
of
dollars
of
daily
operations
in
which
one
party
lends
out
cash
in
exchange
for
a
roughly
equivalent
value
of
securities
usually
treasury
notes
this
market
allows
companies
that
own
lots
of
securities
to
gain
cash
when
they
need
it
at
cheap
rates
the
borrower
of
the
cash
agrees
to
repurchase
the
securities
it
has
loaned
as
collateral
at
a
later
date
often
as
soon
as
the
next
day
the
reasons
for
the
current
turbulence
were
not
entirely
clear
with
various
possible
causes
being
suggested
from
rising
borrowing
needs
of
the
federal
government
to
a
quarterly
tax
payment
date
for
corporations
coming
due
to
the
fed's
moves
to
shrink
its
own
balance
sheet
some
economists
even
suggested
that
the
weekend
attack
on
oil
production
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
could
have
played
a
role
in
increasing
demand
for
cash
by
foreign
banks
with
exposures
to
the
middle
east
i
think
this
was
a
shock
coming
from
outside
of
the
u.s.
banking
system
said
brian
bethune
an
economist
at
tufts
university
in
boston
analysts
say
u.s.
banks
are
much
better
capitalized
now
and
also
have
greater
amount
of
liquidity
that
should
not
leave
them
vulnerable
to
the
same
shocks
seen
in
deborah
cunningham
chief
investment
officer
of
global
liquidity
markets
at
federated
investors
said
that
this
week's
tumult
in
the
repo
market
was
due
to
technical
factors
not
to
worries
about
defaults
or
the
strength
of
the
economy
because
of
that
she
said
it
should
have
little
impact
on
regular
households
you
won't
personally
notice
this
even
though
it's
been
a
headline
item
for
the
better
part
of
a
week
she
said
you
should
not
be
worried
that
loan
rates
are
going
higher
the
federal
reserve
on
wednesday
announced
that
it
was
cutting
its
key
policy
rate
for
the
second
time
this
year
reducing
its
target
for
the
federal
funds
rate
by
another
quarter-point
to
a
new
range
of
to
the
funds
rate
which
is
the
amount
that
banks
charge
each
other
for
overnight
loans
is
the
main
way
the
central
bank
manages
short-term
interest
rates
and
it
can
be
influenced
by
moves
in
the
repo
rate
but
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
said
the
fed
has
the
tools
to
smooth
out
any
sharp
movements
in
the
repo
market
we
don't
see
this
as
having
implication
for
the
broader
economy
or
the
economic
outlook
nor
for
our
ability
to
control
rates
powell
told
reporters
at
a
news
conference
wednesday
following
the
fed's
rate
announcement
if
we
experience
another
episode
of
pressures
in
money
markets
we
have
the
tools
to
address
those
pressures
powell
said
we
will
not
hesitate
to
use
them
