i
hope
there's
an
age
limit
jimmy
carter
questions
whether
he
could
have
handled
the
presidency
at
former
president
jimmy
carter
and
former
first
lady
rosalynn
carter
talk
about
the
future
of
the
carter
center
at
an
event
in
atlanta
on
tuesday
night
branden
camp
ap
former
president
jimmy
carter
expressed
doubt
tuesday
night
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
handle
the
presidency
at
age
saying
the
job
requires
being
very
flexible
with
your
mind
and
suggesting
that
there
should
be
an
age
limit
carter
did
not
mention
any
of
the
current
presidential
candidates
in
his
comments
but
two
leading
democratic
contenders
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
would
turn
while
in
office
if
elected
question's
about
biden's
age
and
mental
acuity
in
particular
have
become
part
of
the
conversation
in
the
democratic
nominating
process
he
is
currently
while
sanders
is
carter
who
turns
next
month
was
asked
during
an
event
at
the
carter
center
in
atlanta
what
it
would
take
for
him
to
run
for
president
again
the
questioner
noted
that
grover
cleveland
had
served
two
nonconsecutive
terms
in
the
late
th
century
i
hope
there's
an
age
limit
carter
said
with
a
big
grin
as
he
sat
next
to
his
wife
rosalynn
carter
jimmy
carter
says
trump
wouldn't
be
president
without
help
from
russia
you
know
if
i
were
just
years
old
if
i
was
years
younger
i
don't
believe
i
could
undertake
the
duties
that
i
experienced
when
i
was
president
he
said
for
one
thing
you
have
to
be
very
flexible
with
your
mind
you
have
to
be
able
to
go
from
one
subject
to
another
and
concentrate
on
each
one
adequately
and
then
put
them
all
together
in
a
comprehensive
way
carter
added
that
presidents
also
have
to
adopt
new
ideas
the
things
i
faced
just
in
foreign
affairs
i
don't
think
i
could
undertake
them
if
i
was
years
old
he
continued
so
is
out
of
the
question
i'm
having
a
hard
time
walking
i
think
the
time
has
passed
for
me
to
be
involved
actively
in
politics
much
less
run
for
president
carter
who
said
he
voted
for
sanders
in
georgia's
democratic
primary
replied
to
a
separate
question
by
saying
he
is
keeping
an
open
mind
about
the
current
crop
of
democrats
one
of
the
major
factors
i
will
have
in
my
mind
is
who
can
beat
trump
he
said
referring
to
the
current
president
who
is
earlier
tuesday
trump's
campaign
released
a
video
that
strung
together
several
of
biden's
recent
verbal
gaffes
and
included
clips
of
political
commentators
questioning
whether
he
remained
as
mentally
sharp
as
he
once
was
during
tuesday
night's
event
rosalynn
carter
also
took
aim
at
trump
i
think
we
need
a
new
president
the
former
first
lady
said
i
am
so
disturbed
about
white
power
he
says
he
is
not
a
racist
and
maybe
he
is
not
but
some
of
the
things
he
says
encourages
racism
