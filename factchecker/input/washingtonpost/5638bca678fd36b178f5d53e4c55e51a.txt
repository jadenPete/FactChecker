president
trump
is
in
danger
of
losing
arguably
his
closest
and
most
loyal
foreign
ally
as
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
fights
for
his
political
life
after
failing
to
win
a
clear
majority
in
israel's
national
elections
netanyahu's
reelection
argument
bet
heavily
on
his
strong
relationship
with
the
american
president
but
in
los
angeles
when
asked
about
the
deadlocked
race
trump
distanced
himself
from
the
embattled
prime
minister
trump
specified
that
our
relations
are
with
israel
and
not
with
one
specific
leader
adding
that
he
had
not
spoken
with
the
man
he
had
previously
described
as
a
close
friend
no
clear
path
forward
the
direction
of
the
country
is
uncertain
as
netanyahu
and
his
chief
rival
benny
gantz
jockey
to
figure
out
partnerships
to
create
a
governing
coalition
but
netanyahu
on
thursday
called
on
the
former
general
to
set
up
a
broad
unity
government
as
soon
as
today
according
to
reuters's
jeffrey
heller
all
this
could
mean
the
u.s.
israel
relationship
is
at
a
turning
point
netanyahu
the
longest-serving
prime
minister
in
israel's
history
is
not
just
an
institution
in
israeli
politics
he's
been
a
fixture
of
trump's
own
domestic
politics
as
well
trump
who
recently
said
american
jews
who
vote
for
democrats
are
being
very
disloyal
to
israel
has
aligned
himself
closely
with
netanyahu's
policies
and
is
frequently
praised
by
the
israeli
leader
the
president's
sudden
cold
shoulder
toward
netanyahu
underscored
trump's
penchant
for
separating
himself
from
political
allies
once
they
become
weakened
or
could
serve
as
a
liability
to
him
anne
writes
but
the
u.s.
administration
argued
that
trump
does
not
view
netanyahu
as
the
linchpin
to
the
u.s.

israel
