preparing
for
a
lengthy
legal
battle
with
the
trump
administration
about
how
much
pollution
to
allow
from
cars
california
regulators
on
thursday
said
they
were
considering
cracking
down
on
other
emissions
to
make
up
for
any
impacts
on
air
quality
the
trump
administration
on
thursday
officially
revoked
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
emission
standards
authority
the
state
has
had
for
decades
under
a
waiver
from
the
federal
clean
air
act
the
changes
won't
take
effect
for
another
days
giving
state
officials
time
to
prepare
a
lawsuit
but
the
litigation
will
be
complex
and
could
last
for
years
in
the
meantime
california
regulators
in
charge
of
reducing
pollutants
are
considering
toughening
limits
on
refinery
emissions
and
imposing
roadway
pricing
which
includes
charging
higher
tolls
during
rush
hour
in
the
hopes
of
keeping
cars
off
the
road
we
must
do
other
things
to
meet
our
commitments
ellen
peter
chief
counsel
for
the
california
air
resources
board
said
during
thursday's
board
meeting
a
spokesman
for
the
board
said
officials
are
evaluating
options
at
this
point
and
aren't
prepared
to
discuss
details
however
the
board
has
been
quite
public
about
the
need
to
make
up
reductions
that
may
be
lost
through
any
federal
attempt
at
intervention
in
state
air
quality
and
greenhouse
gas
regulations
spokesman
dave
clegern
said
this
is
a
public
health
issue
for
california
and
not
an
abstract
exercise
so
we
must
find
additional
reductions
california
has
million
registered
vehicles
giving
it
great
influence
with
the
auto
industry
that
was
evident
in
july
when
democratic
gov
gavin
newsom
announced
that
ford
bmw
honda
and
volkswagen
had
agreed
to
follow
california's
standards
bypassing
the
administration
which
had
been
working
on
new
rules
the
trump
administration's
decision
to
stop
california
from
setting
its
own
emission
standards
for
cars
and
trucks
would
undermine
the
state's
ability
to
convince
the
world's
largest
automakers
that
they
should
make
more
environmentally
friendly
vehicles
we
will
not
let
political
agendas
in
a
single
state
be
forced
upon
the
other
transportation
secretary
elaine
chao
said
thursday
at
a
washington
news
conference
one
california
lawmaker
is
already
working
on
a
way
to
preserve
at
least
some
of
the
state's
environmental
muscle
rebates
for
electric
cars
california
residents
who
buy
or
lease
a
zero-emission
vehicle
can
get
up
to
from
the
state
a
bill
by
democratic
assemblyman
phil
ting
would
mean
people
could
only
get
that
money
if
they
buy
a
car
from
a
company
that
has
agreed
to
follow
california's
emission
standards
we
want
to
be
incentivizing
consumers
to
purchase
from
automakers
that
have
aligned
themselves
with
our
state's
overall
goals
ting
said
i
think
rebates
are
one
tool
i'm
sure
the
administration
and
the
state
will
be
looking
at
other
tools
that
we
have
david
vogel
a
professor
emeritus
of
business
ethics
at
the
haas
school
of
business
of
the
university
of
california-berkeley
noted
california
could
accomplish
its
goals
through
various
tax
changes
which
the
federal
government
could
not
stop
even
if
the
trump
administration
would
win
on
this
california
could
use
taxes
to
accomplish
much
of
the
same
goals
vogel
said
the
federal
government
would
have
less
of
an
ability
to
challenge
because
states
can
pretty
much
tax
who
they
want
trump
said
his
move
would
result
in
less
expensive
safer
cars
he
predicted
americans
would
purchase
more
new
cars
which
would
result
in
cleaner
air
as
older
models
are
taken
off
the
roads
many
more
cars
will
be
produced
under
the
new
and
uniform
standard
meaning
significantly
more
jobs
jobs
jobs
automakers
should
seize
this
opportunity
because
without
this
alternative
to
california
you
will
be
out
of
business
trump
tweeted
environmental
protection
agency
chief
andrew
wheeler
said
at
the
thursday
news
conference
with
chao
that
trump's
approach
was
good
for
public
safety
good
for
the
economy
and
good
for
the
environment
wheeler
also
played
down
electric
vehicles
calling
them
a
product
that
has
minimal
impact
on
the
environment
and
which
most
families
cannot
approach
u.s.
automakers
contend
that
without
year-over-year
increases
in
fuel
efficiency
that
align
with
global
market
realities
their
vehicles
could
be
less
competitive
potentially
resulting
in
job
losses
but
most
of
the
industry
favors
increases
in
standards
that
are
less
than
the
obama-era
requirements
saying
their
consumers
are
gravitating
to
suvs
and
trucks
rather
than
buying
more
efficient
cars
top
california
officials
and
environmental
groups
pledged
legal
action
to
stop
the
trump
rollback
the
u.s.
transportation
sector
is
the
nation's
biggest
single
source
of
greenhouse
gasses
trump's
claim
that
his
proposal
would
result
in
a
cleaner
environment
is
contrary
to
his
own
administration's
estimate
that
by
freezing
economy
standards
u.s.
fuel
consumption
would
increase
by
about
barrels
per
day
a
to
increase
environmental
groups
predict
even
more
fuel
consumed
resulting
in
higher
pollution
the
administration
argues
that
lower-cost
vehicles
would
allow
more
people
to
buy
new
ones
that
are
safer
cutting
roadway
deaths
by
lives
through
the
model
year
but
the
associated
press
reported
last
year
that
internal
epa
emails
show
senior
career
officials
privately
questioned
the
administration's
calculations
saying
the
proposed
freeze
would
actually
modestly
increase
highway
fatalities
by
about
deaths
annually
