the

passage
of
a
short-term

bill
thursday
sets
up
another
funding
showdown
in

bonnie

mount
the
washington
post
the
house
voted
overwhelmingly
thursday
to
keep
the
government
open
through
late
november
setting
up
a
huge
showdown
later
this
year
over
president
trump's
border
wall
that
could
force
another
shutdown
before
thanksgiving
the
short-term
nature
of
thursday's
legislation
was
the
result
of
failed
efforts
to
complete
a
broader
spending
package
ahead
of
sept
when
government
funding
is
set
to
expire
for
multiple
agencies
the
need
for
the
stopgap
measure
shows
how
fundamental
spending
issues
between
democrats
and
republicans
remain
unresolved
even
though
lawmakers
believed
they
had
dispatched
the
thorniest
problems
in
a
sweeping
budget
deal
completed
over
the
summer
to
buy
themselves
more
time
to
negotiate
lawmakers
decided
to
delay
the
tougher
decisions
for
two
months
the
legislation
passed
thursday
by
the
house
keeps
government
spending
flowing
through
nov
the
vote
was
to
the
senate
is
scheduled
to
pass
the
measure
next
week
with
just
days
to
spare
ahead
of
the
sept
deadline
and
trump
is
expected
to
sign
it
into
law
trump's
presidency
has
been
marked
by
a
number
of
stopgap
spending
bills
that
either
keep
levels
flat
or
ratchet
them
higher
the
white
house
has
called
for
deep
spending
cuts
on
education
housing
and
foreign
aid
programs
among
others
but
trump
has
also
insisted
on
a
bigger
budget
for
defense
and
money
to
build
a
wall
along
the
mexico
border
democrats
have
fought
back
leading
to
numerous
compromises
that
have
continued
to
add
billions
of
dollars
in
new
spending
each
year
major
differences
between
the
parties
remain
though
particularly
over
whether
taxpayers
should
finance
construction
of
a
border
wall
and
whether
congress
should
agree
to
a
demand
from
democrats
to
direct
more
money
for
health
programs
among
other
things
there's
scant
reason
to
believe
lawmakers
will
reach
resolution
on
these
issues
by
nov
and
many
are
already
discussing
the
need
to
pass
another
short-term
spending
bill
before
thanksgiving
at
the
core
of
the
dispute
senate
democrats
assertions
that
republicans
are
diverting
money
to
trump's
southern
border
wall
that
should
be
going
toward
domestic
programs
republicans
deny
the
claims
but
democrats
are
blocking
action
on
spending
bills
for
the
pentagon
and
other
agencies
as
they
press
their
complaints
and
some
lawmakers
particularly
democrats
are
already
predicting
that
they
are
going
to
end
up
right
where
they
were
last
winter
lawmakers
rejected
trump's
demand
for
taxpayer
money
to
build
a
border
wall
in
december
triggering
a
partial
government
shutdown
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
the
republicans
think
this
is
going
to
play
out
differently
than
it
did
last
year
said
sen
brian
schatz
d-hawaii
a
member
of
the
senate
appropriations
committee
some
republicans
are
similarly
pessimistic
about
the
trajectory
congress
is
on
even
while
insisting
that
this
time
a
shutdown
will
somehow
be
avoided
we're
going
to
extend
it
til
the
day
before
thanksgiving
break
surprise
surprise
said
rep
mark
meadows
r-n
c.
a
leader
of
the
conservative
freedom
caucus
and
then
we're
going
to
extend
it
til
the
day
before
the
christmas
break
surprise
surprise
and
then
we're
going
to
end
up
putting
bad
things
in
a
bill
that
supposedly
was
agreed
to
months
ago
despite
the
challenges
of
divided
government
there
was
a
breakthrough
in
july
when
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
struck
a
deal
with
the
trump
administration
setting
overall
spending
levels
for
and
and
suspending
the
federal
debt
ceiling
until
after
the
election
the
deal
was
supposed
to
reduce
the
threat
of
a
shutdown
by
making
it
easier
for
spending
committees
to
write
appropriations
bills
because
topline
numbers
had
been
set
but
the
current
spending
struggle
in
the
senate
has
raised
the
possibility
that
even
with
the
budget
deal
in
place
lawmakers
might
be
unable
to
reach
agreement
on
how
to
dole
out
about
trillion
across
the
pentagon
and
federal
agencies
for
senate
appropriations
committee
chairman
richard
c.
shelby
r-ala
told
reporters
thursday
that
without
an
agreement
reached
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
full
budget
year
would
have
to
be
funded
by
a
year-long
continuing
resolution
that
keeps
existing
spending
levels
in
place
we're
at
a
crossroads
right
now
shelby
said
i
don't
know
what'll
happen
shelby's
committee
approved
several
less
controversial
spending
bills
on
thursday
and
one
possibility
is
that
legislation
funding
some
portions
of
the
government
could
pass
even
if
negotiations
drag
on
over
contentious
issues
such
as
the
wall
lawmakers
said
moving
beyond
the
current
impasse
will
require
high-level
bipartisan
and
bicameral
negotiations
that
have
yet
to
begin
in
earnest
in
one
sign
of
progress
however
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-calif
said
thursday
that
he
had
spoken
with
senate
minority
leader
charles
e.
schumer
d-n
y.
and
expressed
optimism
about
chances
for
progress
i
think
that's
more
theater
than
anything
i
think
we'll
get
it
done
mccarthy
said
of
disputes
in
the
senate
house
majority
leader
steny
h.
hoyer
d-md
and
others
insisted
that
it
was
incumbent
on
congress
to
get
the
job
done
there
is
no
reason
in
god's
green
earth
we
cannot
complete
our
business
on
the
appropriations
process
by
november
not
a
single
reason
except
procrastination
and
an
unwillingness
to
compromise
hoyer
said
