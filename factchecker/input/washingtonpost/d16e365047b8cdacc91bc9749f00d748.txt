former
vice
president
joe
biden
prepared
more
zingers
for
elizabeth
warren
at
the
last
debate
than
he
was
able
to
deliver
onstage
so
a
day
later
at
a
fundraiser
in
a
wealthy
houston
neighborhood
he
decided
to
let
fly
we
need
more
than
plans
we
need
a
president
he
said
referring
to
the
policy-heavy
campaign
of
the
senator
from
massachusetts
he
also
joked
about
how
half
the
people
on
the
debate
stage
were
republicans
back
in
in
fact
there
was
only
one
warren
who
has
said
she
identified
as
a
republican
or
independent
before
the
message
biden
was
sending
a
continuation
of
attacks
on
her
qualifications
and
candor
that
he
began
the
night
before
went
beyond
the
details
it
signaled
a
new
effort
by
multiple
candidates
to
tangle
with
warren
who
has
largely
avoided
conflict
with
her
primary
rivals
while
rising
steadily
in
the
polls
distancing
herself
from
much
of
the
pack
and
emerging
as
a
direct
threat
to
biden
interviews
with
senior
campaign
staff
of
four
rival
campaigns
reveal
a
clear
desire
to
increase
voter
scrutiny
of
warren
and
her
record
and
remarkably
similar
game
plans
of
how
to
do
it
they
argue
that
she
has
been
given
a
pass
for
much
of
the
year
with
her
professional
and
political
history
receiving
less
scrutiny
than
other
candidates
they
also
argue
that
the
divisive
impacts
of
some
of
her
policy
proposals
including
medicare-for-all
which
she
supports
along
with
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
have
not
yet
been
fully
presented
to
the
party's
voters
days
after
the
debate
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
who
is
trying
to
reposition
himself
in
the
race
became
the
second
candidate
to
go
public
with
an
attack
on
warren
arguing
in
television
interviews
and
in
a
facebook
ad
that
the
sanders-warren
vision
for
health
care
would
polarize
the
country
not
bring
it
together
sen
michael
f.
bennet
d-colo
has
also
purchased
more
than
million
in
ads
in
iowa
arguing
against
medicare-for-all
including
one
spot
that
argues
the
plan
will
blow
up
everything
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
joined
the
effort
thursday
during
a
visit
to
detroit
when
she
referred
to
warren's
law
professor
background
without
naming
her
in
response
to
a
question
about
appealing
to
rural
voters
my
view
of
this
is
that
we've
got
a
lot
of
great
people
running
but
some
of
these
ideas
are
better
left
in
the
college
faculty
lounge
than
right
here
at
this
port
klobuchar
said
i'm
a
common-sense
person
that's
always
governed
by
that
but
the
broader
unfolding
critique
against
warren
attempts
to
raise
deeper
questions
about
how
she
presents
herself
advisers
to
some
rival
campaigns
point
to
her
past
identification
as
a
republican
and
her
corporate
consulting
work
on
bankruptcy
cases
they
also
note
her
record
of
soliciting
donations
from
wealthy
individuals
including
lobbyists
before
deciding
to
stop
taking
lobbyists
money
and
earlier
this
year
to
cease
major
fundraising
events
warren's
team
has
refused
to
be
swayed
by
such
taunts
warren
a
former
statewide
high
school
debate
champion
has
ably
defused
confrontation
in
the
first
three
debates
repeatedly
returning
to
her
central
message
which
is
that
she
is
a
fighter
ready
to
confront
political
and
economic
elites
who
are
responsible
for
middle-class
struggles
it's
a
message
that
has
attracted
a
significant
following
as
demonstrated
by
a
person
rally
monday
night
in
manhattan
we
will
continue
to
run
the
campaign
we
have
from
the
beginning
identifying
what
is
broken
talking
about
our
plans
to
fix
it
and
building
a
grass-roots
movement
to
make
it
happen
warren
communications
director
kristen
orthman
said
in
response
to
the
attacks
biden
who
continues
to
lead
in
national
and
early
state
polls
has
been
leading
the
new
critique
of
warren
by
raising
questions
about
her
candor
with
a
focus
on
her
refusal
to
describe
the
details
of
medicare-for-all
his
campaign
previewed
the
last
debate
by
boasting
that
he
was
the
only
candidate
who
had
released
years
of
tax
returns
an
oblique
reference
to
warren
who
has
released
years
of
returns
not
including
years
when
she
did
the
bulk
of
her
corporate
legal
work
unlike
sanders
who
has
admitted
that
the
health
insurance
program
would
raise
middle-
class
taxes
while
aiming
to
reduce
total
costs
warren
has
refused
to
answer
the
question
about
whether
medicare-for-all
would
raise
middle-class
taxes
she
has
described
the
question
as
missing
the
point
saying
total
cost
is
all
that
matters
for
struggling
families
when
you're
not
candid
about
what
you're
going
to
do
it
makes
it
very
difficult
biden
told
reporters
friday
warren
has
argued
that
the
corporate
work
she
did
while
serving
as
a
law
professor
for
clients
such
as
dow
chemical
and
travelers
insurance
was
focused
on
helping
victims
hurt
by
bankrupt
companies
including
asbestos
claimants
and
women
with
breast
implants
that
could
rupture
in
may
she
disclosed
a
list
of
about
legal
matters
that
she
worked
on
including
many
that
were
not
previously
known
the
decision
to
go
after
warren
more
directly
carries
clear
risks
for
her
rivals
the
first
months
of
the
democratic
primary
have
been
littered
with
candidates
who
became
casualties
of
their
own
offensives
which
democratic
voters
tend
to
recoil
from
especially
in
early
voting
states
such
as
iowa
sen
kamala
d.
harris
d-calif
faded
in
polls
after
a
brief
spike
following
a
fierce
critique
of
biden
on
school
segregation
policy
in
the
june
debate
former
u.s.
housing
secretary
juli
n
castro
found
himself
on
defense
after
inaccurately
suggesting
at
the
last
debate
that
biden
had
forgotten
what
he
had
said
a
few
minutes
earlier
two
others
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
d-n
y.
and
rep
eric
swalwell
d-calif
left
the
race
shortly
after
using
their
prime-time
debate
time
to
attack
biden
directly
but
warren's
rivals
also
feel
there
is
a
potentially
greater
cost
to
letting
warren
continue
her
campaign
without
more
scrutiny
after
showing
herself
to
be
the
only
candidate
in
the
race
who
has
been
gaining
strength
for
much
of
the
year
if
you
look
at
biden
for
example
he
has
taken
incoming
essentially
every
day
of
the
campaign
since
he
got
in
frankly
since
before
he
got
in
and
his
support
hasn't
moved
i
think
it
is
an
open
question
what
happens
to
her
support
when
she
starts
taking
incoming
as
well
said
one
democrat
affiliated
with
a
rival
campaign
who
like
several
others
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
campaign
messaging
strategy
she
hasn't
been
tested
in
the
same
way
advisers
to
two
other
campaigns
said
the
policy
approach
of
warren
which
is
focused
on
what
she
calls
big
structural
change
probably
would
foreclose
the
possibility
of
bringing
the
country
together
after
the
trump
administration
if
people
are
tired
of
war
all
the
time
in
our
country
and
a
press
who
is
fomenting
those
divides
how
is
a
progressive
overhaul
of
the
whole
country
going
to
answer
to
that
asked
an
adviser
for
a
second
campaign
in
describing
how
she
could
be
challenged
the
democratic
questions
about
warren's
candor
echo
a
separate
line
of
argument
that
has
been
developed
by
trump
and
his
republican
allies
in
case
warren
wins
the
nomination
the
republican
national
committee
regularly
calls
her
a
fraud
and
trump
has
attempted
to
use
warren's
past
identification
as
a
native
american
as
evidence
that
she
is
not
who
she
presents
herself
to
be
former
republican
political
strategist
steve
schmidt
who
served
as
sen
john
mccain
of
arizona's
campaign
manager
and
left
the
republican
party
because
of
trump
said
that
warren's
vulnerability
on
this
score
will
be
tested
if
she
makes
it
to
the
general
election
while
liberals
dismiss
the
president's
pocahontas
nickname
for
warren
as
a
racist
slur
schmidt
said
that
many
voters
probably
will
hear
in
it
a
reminder
of
the
allegation
that
warren
tried
to
game
the
system
in
academia
although
those
involved
in
her
hirings
say
it
did
not
play
a
role
while
he
called
trump
the
most
prolific
liar
that
has
ever
run
for
office
schmidt
said
trump
had
also
proudly
described
his
own
efforts
to
find
personal
advantage
in
his
private
life
like
his
efforts
to
reduce
his
own
tax
bill
there
is
no
artifice
schmidt
said
of
trump
any
candidate
that
gets
into
a
quagmire
around
honesty
issues
with
trump
is
going
to
be
a
defeated
candidate
so
far
warren
has
not
had
to
worry
about
attacks
from
the
other
leading
candidate
in
the
race
pushing
for
dramatic
policy
change
sanders
and
warren
have
refrained
from
challenging
each
other
publicly
and
warren
has
repeatedly
praised
his
ideas
but
there
are
some
staff-level
tensions
below
the
surface
as
sanders
advisers
seek
to
draw
electability
comparisons
with
warren
in
a
tuesday
email
to
supporters
sanders
aides
pointed
to
some
recent
polls
showing
his
leads
over
both
biden
and
warren
in
support
among
working-class
white
and
latino
voters
an
nbc-wall
street
journal
poll
on
tuesday
showed
warren
slightly
edging
sanders
and
biden
among
latinos
and
polling
higher
than
sanders
among
whites
without
a
college
degree
sanders
has
also
not
held
back
from
competing
for
the
same
voters
warren
seeks
he
plans
to
hold
a
rally
sunday
in
norman
okla
warren's
birthplace
and
one
of
the
few
states
that
will
vote
in
the
early
spring
that
she
has
yet
to
visit
as
part
of
her
campaign
the
sanders
campaign
has
distinguished
itself
by
eagerly
pushing
back
against
biden's
attacks
on
medicare-for-all

campaign
