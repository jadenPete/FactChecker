dead
people
don't
vote
it
is

group
that
politicians
truly
don't
care
about
after
all
even
people
younger
than
will
likely
end
up
voting
someday
dying
however
is
of
immediate
concern
to
political
campaigns
death
tends
to
happen
disproportionately
to
older
americans
for
obvious
reasons
about
three-quarters
of
deaths
in
were
among
those
and
older
according
to
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
data
and
people
who
are
and
older
tend
to
vote
a
lot
and
vote
republican
hence
the
concern
what
happens
to
a
party
when
its
base
dies
off
look
the
gop
isn't
going
to
literally
die
off
anytime
soon
but
when
you're
a
political
party
that
sneaked
into
the
white
house
on
the
strength
of
votes
in
three
states
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
having
a
significant
portion
of
your
voter
base
in
that
and-older
group
has
to
be
somewhat
worrisome
younger
voters
are
overwhelmingly
democratic
but
also
tend
to
be
lackadaisical
about
casting
ballots
that
foundation
of
older
conservative
voters
is
essential
to
the
gop
we
wondered
then
how
much
death
had
reshaped
the
electorate
since
the
election
was
it
the
case
for
example
that
the
grim
reaper
is
conducting
the
final
get-out-the-vote
in
red
states
more
than
blue
ones
what
does
that
mean
for
thanks
to
data
from
l
a
nonpartisan
voter
data
firm
we
can
report
that
in
nearly
every
state
the
number
of
new
voters
added
since
the
election
is
larger
than
the
number
of
voters
removed
from
the
voting
rolls
because
of
being
dead
but
the
variation
in
the
relationship
between
those
two
groups
of
voters
living
dead
is
itself
not
even
nor
is
the
partisan
composition
of
the
new-voter
pool
contrast
west
virginia
with
texas
on
the
map
below
for
example
there's
a
lot
of
data
there
so
just
focus
on
two
circles
the
black
one
showing
deaths
since
the
election
relative
to
the
total
current
pool
of
voters
in
the
state
and
the

showing

registrants
by
party
also
relative
to
the
total
current
voter
pool
philip
bump
the
washington
post
in
west
virginia
the
number
of
deaths
is
slightly
higher
than
the
number
of
new
voters
the
black
circle
is
larger
than
the
pie
chart
in
texas
there
are
a
lot
more
new
voters
since
the
election
and
they
are
registering
as
democrats
blue
more
than
republicans
red
or
independents
third
party
gray
both
of
those
states
voted
for
trump
in
as
you
probably
know
the
data
above
reinforces
how
they
otherwise
differ
over
the
long
term
west
virginia
is
getting
redder
and
older
while
texas
gets
more
blue
with
a
booming
population
red
states
in
fact
have
seen
a
lot
more
deaths
of
registered
voters
than
blue
ones
since
the
election
blue
states
have
lost
a
little
over
million
voters
since
the
election
compared
with
million
in
red
states
for
the
purpose
of
this
article
we're
considering
d.c.
to
be
a
state
though
it
still
will
not
receive
any
senators
of
course
there
are
more
red
states
than
blue
ones
on
average
red
states
saw
more
voters
cross
the
river
styx
than
blue
states
philip
bump
the
washington
post
the
category
of
states
that
had
the
heaviest
average
loss
those
three
states
that
flipped
from
blue
to
red
they
lost
an
average
of
voters
slightly
more
than
the
other
states
trump
won
more
narrowly
those
states
which
exclude
the
three
that
flipped
lost
an
average
of
but
again
most
states
also
saw
a
surge
of
new
voters
here
the
gap
was
narrower
with
blue
states
adding
about
million
voters
on
average
and
red
states
adding
million
on
average
philip
bump
the
washington
post
notice
the
two
categories
that
added
the
most
average
new
voters
states
that
voted
heavily
for
democrat
hillary
clinton
and
states
that
voted
more
narrowly
for
trump
dark-blue
states
adding
more
voters
is
a
central
reason
the
electoral
vote
favors
republicans
those
votes
are
added
to
states
without
shifting
the
number
of
electoral
votes
they're
worth
for
now
and
that's
the
central
question
here
right
shifts
in
votes
that
brings
us
to
those
states
that
trump
won
more
narrowly
it's
the
category
that
saw
the
biggest
net
change
when
comparing
deaths
to
new
voters
with
a
net
gain
of
voters
on
average
since
the
election
philip
bump
the
washington
post
it's
these
states
and
the
states
that
flipped
that
democrats
need
to
eat
into
if
they're
going
to
win
in
the
states
that
flipped
lost
more
older
voters
but
still
added
voters
on
net
the
lighter-red
states
added
a
lot
of
voters
relative
to
other
states
there's
a
very
small
correlation
between
the
margin
in
a
state
and
how
its
voter
pool
changed
since
that
election
the
states
that
saw
the
biggest
net
increases
tended
to
vote
more
heavily
democratic
as
the
graph
above
also
shows
down
in
the
bottom-right
corner
below
west
virginia
dark
red
but
with
as
many
deaths
as
new
voters
according
to
our
data
philip
bump
the
washington
post
what
matters
for
determining
how
the
states
are
shifting
is
how
those
new
voters
plan
to
vote
happily
we
can
get
some
sense
of
that
by
looking
at
their
stated
political
parties
or
in
states
without
declared
party
affiliations
how
l
figures
they
are
likely
to
vote
did
they
request
a
democratic
primary
ballot
in
for
example
in
most
cases
there
are
more
independents
than
members
of
either
party
that
were
added
to
the
voter
pools
in
these
states
but
in
the
seven
groups
we've
been
looking
at
six
saw
more
new
democrats
than
new
republicans
in
the
aggregate
the
only
group
that
saw
more
republicans
was
the
group
of
the
most
heavily
pro-trump
states
you
can
compare
that
with
how
those
states
voted
in
as
below
philip
bump
the
washington
post
this
dynamic
also
makes
sense
a
lot
of
new
registrants
are
people
who
haven't
registered
before
teenagers
and
young
people
just
getting
into
the
habit
and
that's
a
group
that
again
skews
more
heavily
democratic
it's
the
flip
side
of
the
republican
concern
about
losing
older
voters
a
lot
of
the
new
voters
they're
getting
aren't
republicans
of
course
all
of
those
independents
muddy
the
water
a
bit
independents
tend
to
vote
heavily
along
consistent
partisan
lines
but
we
can't
see
which
party
just
from
voter
registration
so
let's
consider
each
state
on
two
dimensions
the
gap
between
democratic
and
republican
registration
and
the
density
of
independent
or
third-party
registrants
in
the
state
we
get
this
philip
bump
the
washington
post
it's
shaped
something
like
a
triangle
because
the
less
dense
the
partisan
registration
in
a
state
the
smaller
the
margin
between
the
parties
can
be
but
let's
consider
three
states
in
particular
on
this
metric
first
there's
illinois
the
l
data
suggests
that
most
of
the
new
additions
are
independent
or
third-party
so
the
state
is
up
there
at
the
top
of
our
chart
but
the
washington
post
is
predicting
that
illinois
will
checks
notes
stay
blue
in
with
some
states
we
feel
pretty
comfortable
in
making
assumptions
about
the
voter
pools
then
there's
texas
we
noted
before
that
there
were
more
new
democrats
there
than
republicans
in
our
data
we'll
note
here
that
we're
still
months
from
the
general
election
and
these
numbers
will
shift
as
more
people
register
that
said
texas
is
down
in
the
lower
left
part
of
this
graph
meaning
more
identifiably
partisan
registration
and
more
of
that
registration
made
up
of
democrats
more
so
than
california
interesting
but
not
as
interesting
as
michigan
where
the
new
registrations
are
heavily
democratic
that's
in
keeping
with
the
average
for
those
three
states
that
turned
red
in
they
may
have
been
won
by
trump
narrowly
in
but
since
then
they're
registering
a
lot
more
democrats
philip
bump
the
washington
post
since
those
three
states
have
lost
voters
to
death
may
they
rest
in
peace
they've
added
million
voters
l
s
data
tells
us
that
of
those
new
voters
are
democrats
and
are
republican
a
difference
of
these
are
the
states
that
elected
trump
by
a
combined
votes
