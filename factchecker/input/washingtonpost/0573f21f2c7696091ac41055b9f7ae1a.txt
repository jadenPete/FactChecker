some
democrats
have
reservations
about
candidates
age
but
the
oldest
primary
contenders
are
leading
the
pack
the
age
question
that
burst
into
the
open
in
last
week's
debate
got
some
fresh
validation
tuesday
from
an
unlikely
source
former
president
jimmy
carter
said
there
should
be
a
limit
on
the
age
of
a
president
and
that
he
didn't
think
he
could
have
done
it
well
at
polling
bears
out
that
a
sizable
number
of
democrats
have
some
concerns
about
nominating
a
candidate
who
is
over
or
at
least
they
would
prefer
someone
younger
in
the
most
recent
washington
post-abc
poll
nearly
percent
of
democrats
said
age
does
not
matter
when
it
comes
to
the
democratic
nominee's
likelihood
of
beating
president
trump
four
in
said
the
nominee
needs
to
be
under
years
old
that
rubs
up
against
the
reality
of
the
race
to
be
their
nominee
most
democratic
voters
are
rallying
behind
the
three
oldest
candidates
in
their
primary
field
all
three
candidates
in
the
top
tier
of
the
democratic
field
are
at
least
former
vice
president
joe
biden
is
sen
elizabeth
warren
d.
mass
is
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
is
the
three
combined
for
percent
of
the
support
of
democratic
voters
according
to
the
most
recent
post
abc
poll
a
poll
from
nbc
and
the
wall
street
journal
released
tuesday
has
their
combined
support
at
percent
among
likely
democratic
primary-
or
caucus-goers
claudia
mrozek
a
year-old
scottsdale
ariz
resident
said
that
the
democratic
nominee
needs
to
be
someone
younger
than
or
at
least
someone
who
is
young
in
thinking
a
lot
of
voters
want
to
feel
secure
with
someone
who
is
very
familiar
with
the
job
or
who
has
done
it
before
like
biden
she
told
the
fix
personally
i
feel
they
are
ready
for
someone
who
is
younger
and
has
energy
and
brings
new
ideas
to
the
table
the
year-old
carter
who
served
as
president
when
he
was
in
his
s
didn't
say
what
he
thinks
the
age
limit
should
be
he
noted
that
he
does
not
believe
he
could
have
done
the
job
well
as
an
year-old
you
know
if
i
were
just
years
old
if
i
was
years
younger
i
don't
believe
i
could
undertake
the
duties
that
i
experienced
when
i
was
president
he
said
tuesday
for
one
thing
you
have
to
be
very
flexible
with
your
mind
you
have
to
be
able
to
go
from
one
subject
to
another
and
concentrate
on
each
one
adequately
and
then
put
them
all
together
in
a
comprehensive
way
biden
or
sanders
would
turn
during
their
first
term
in
office
if
elected
trump
who
is
now
isn't
that
far
behind
following
the
outcome
of
the
midterm
elections
the
success
of
these
older
candidates
is
in
some
ways
surprising
the
races
were
largely
viewed
as
a
referendum
on
trump
but
they
were
also
viewed
as
a
mandate
to
the
country's
political
leaders
it
was
time
to
expand
the
number
of
new
and
younger
voices
at
the
decision-making
table
and
data
released
as
recently
as
may
supports
that
position
only
percent
of
democrats
said
the
best
age
for
president
is
in
their
s
according
to
a
pew
research
center
poll
that
was
in
the
abstract
fred
vearnon
a
year-old
from
pittsburgh
said
a
younger
nominee
is
necessary
to
focus
on
the
issues
of
the
future
when
you're
over
you're
thinking
old
school
the
world
is
not
old
school
anymore
you've
got
climate
change
you've
got
cities
in
years
that
will
be
under
water
you've
got
to
think
new
he
told
the
fix
what
support
for
these
candidates
could
be
showing
is
that
while
being
in
one's
s
might
not
be
the
ideal
age
for
democratic
voters
looking
to
replace
trump
biden
warren
and
sanders
carry
some
of
the
traits
democratic
voters
find
most
attractive
in
this
moment
trump's
presidency
has
been
plagued
by
low
job-approval
ratings
from
its
earliest
days
the
president
who
campaigned
as
an
outsider
interested
in
cleaning
up
the
swamp
has
made
it
murkier
according
to
his
critics
the
washington
outsider
regularly
displays
a
lack
of
familiarity
with
government
it
is
this
frustration
that
draws
many
supporters
of
biden
to
the
veteran
lawmaker
who
argues
that
his
experience
in
washington
makes
him
the
most
qualified
person
to
pursue
the
white
house
after
all
he
was
in
washington
before
some
of
his
competitors
in
the
race
rep
tulsi
gabbard
of
hawaii
and
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
were
even
born
there
have
been
a
few
instances
recently
that
put
biden's
mental
sharpness
into
question
former
hud
secretary
juli
n
castro's
confrontation
of
biden
on
his
memory
in
last
week's
debate
brought
those
to
the
forefront
but
those
concerns
have
not
kept
percent
of
democrats
from
believing
that
biden
according
to
the
post's
most
recent
poll
has
the
best
chance
of
beating
trump
in
a
general
election
biden
would
be
the
oldest
person
sworn
into
the
presidency
if
elected
interest
in
biden
sanders
and
warren
in
particular
has
remained
steady
more
than
four
in
voters
who
lean
democratic
have
strongly
favorable
views
of
these
three
candidates
showing
that
enthusiasm
accompanies
many
voters
support
an
important
indicator
when
it
comes
to
measuring
turn
out
whatever
anxiety
some
democratic
voters
have
about
backing
older
candidates
up
to
this
point
has
not
ultimately
been
reflected
in
the
polls
when
they
consider
actual
candidates
