washington
first
lady
melania
trump
cut
the
ribbon
thursday
as
the
washington
monument
reopened
to
the
public
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
the
foot
stone
obelisk
closed
in
september
in
order
to
replace
the
aging
elevator
and
upgrade
security
systems
accompanied
by
a
group
of
local
fourth
graders
trump
took
the
new
high-speed
elevator
to
the
observation
floor
near
the
top
which
offers
a
commanding
degree
view
of
the
entire
district
of
columbia
the
monument
has
been
closed
off
and
on
for
most
of
the
past
eight
years
an
august
earthquake
left
cracks
in
the
stones
near
the
top
of
the
obelisk
it
reopened
in
but
national
park
service
officials
were
forced
to
close
it
again
two
years
later
after
a
series
of
elevator
breakdowns
this
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
buildings
in
the
world
and
one
of
the
signature
attractions
of
any
visit
to
washington
said
jeff
reinbold
superintendent
of
the
national
mall
for
the
national
park
service
so
we
really
didn't
want
to
close
it
we
kept
putting
band-aids
on
but
eventually
we
had
no
choice
with
the
closure
already
necessary
officials
took
the
opportunity
to
build
a
completely
new
high-tech
security
screening
facility
all
told
the
project
cost
million
million
for
the
elevator
and
the
rest
for
the
security
center
the
new
facility
juts
like
a
grey
cube
from
the
base
of
the
marble
obelisk
inside
visiters
find
literally
gleaming
new
machinery
and
automated
bank-vault
type
doors
blocking
the
way
to
the
elevator
nps
spokesman
mike
litterst
said
the
previous
security
system
was
hastily
arranged
in
the
aftermath
of
the
attacks
he
recalled
a
more
innocent
pre-
time
when
visitors
were
hardly
screened
at
all
and
overnight
security
consisted
of
a
couple
of
alarms
and
two
iron
gates
that
we
locked
at
night
after
such
a
long
closure
anticipation
is
high
among
both
staffers
and
visitors
tickets
for
thursday
sold
out
in
an
hour
reinbold
said
for
the
remainder
of
september
the
monument
is
extending
its
visiting
hours
from
a
m
to
p
m
to
accommodate
the
demand
however
they
are
also
limiting
the
number
of
tickets
as
staffers
continue
to
adapt
to
the
new
equipment
we'll
keep
ramping
the
number
of
visitors
up
as
we
get
used
to
the
facility
reinbold
said
starting
in
october
the
monument
will
revert
to
its
normal
a
m
to
p
m
schedule
for
now
tickets
must
be
purchased
in
person
reinbold
said
they
would
soon
begin
offering
about
half
of
any
given
day's
tickets
online
construction
on
the
monument
began
in
and
took
nearly
years
to
complete
the
private
organization
that
was
running
the
project
ran
out
of
funding
and
construction
was
halted
in
at
around
feet
that
delay
was
exacerbated
by
the
civil
war
construction
resumed
in
but
builders
were
forced
to
use
stone
from
a
different
quarry
giving
the
obelisk
its
distinctive
two-tone
color
at
the
time
of
its
completion
in
it
was
the
tallest
building
in
the
world
but
was
soon
overtaken
by
the
eiffel
tower
in
it
remains
the
tallest
building
in
washington
and

open
averages
about
