iowa
kamala
harris
will
exponentially
increase
the
time
she's
spending
in
iowa
bernie
sanders
is
shaking
up
his
operations
there
and
in
new
hampshire
and
beto
o'rourke
is
going
broader
turning
up
at
such
places
as
a
san
quentin
prison
and
an
arkansas
gun
show
with
just
over
four
months
until
the
iowa
caucuses
usher
in
the
battle
for
the
democratic
nomination
candidates
are
shifting
their
approaches
to
the
state
some
are
betting
the
changes
will
pay
off
closer
to
the
caucuses
others
are
lowering
expectations
by
looking
beyond
iowa
all
are
confronting
the
reality
that
the
heady
early
days
of
their
campaigns
will
soon
collide
with
actual
voting
that
could
quickly
force
them
out
of
the
race
this
is
the
place
where
you
would
see
larger-scale
course
corrections
said
democratic
strategist
karen
finney
over
the
summer
there's
tinkering
here
or
there
but
with
voting
starting
in
four
months
you
have
to
be
thinking
about
where
you
want
to
be
by
that
point
harris
was
the
latest
candidate
to
pivot
after
a
challenging
summer
in
which
she's
struggled
to
catch
up
to
early
front-runner
joe
biden
or
capture
the
same
energy
as
elizabeth
warren
juan
rodriguez
harris
campaign
manager
told
reporters
thursday
that
the
california
senator
is
going
big
in
iowa
dedicating
paid
staffers
to
the
state
we
want
to
make
sure
we
have
a
strong
top-three
finish
rodriguez
said
arguing
that
the
feb
caucuses
could
slingshot
harris
into
the
contests
that
quickly
follow
in
new
hampshire
south
carolina
and
the
super
tuesday
states
including
california
as
harris
and
virtually
every
other
democratic
contender
descend
on
iowa
this
weekend
for
the
annual
steak
fry
fundraiser
they're
well
aware
of
what's
on
the
line
iowa
has
repeatedly
proved
decisive
in
winnowing
the
presidential
field
or
providing
a
path
to
victory
john
kerry
once
the
campaign's
early
front-runner
was
lagging
behind
upstart
howard
dean
in
the
fall
of
only
to
shake
up
his
campaign
in
october
reinvest
heavily
in
iowa
and
race
to
victory
in
the
closing
weeks
likewise
barack
obama's
late
surge
past
better-known
names
including
hillary
clinton
capped
a
once-unlikely
win
in
iowa
that
set
him
on
the
road
to
the
nomination
and
presidency
joe
trippi
who
ran
dean's
campaign
said
no
one
should
be
counted
out
despite
polls
that
show
a
largely
static
top
tier
of
candidates
including
biden
sanders
and
warren
iowa
moves
frickin
fast
and
hard
at
the
end
and
it's
not
necessarily
who
you'd
expect
that
comes
out
on
top
he
said
you
can
go
the
whole
way
thinking
howard
dean
has
it
locked
up
and
you
find
out
the
hard
way
that's
not
how
it
works
with
that
in
mind
many
candidates
are
building
sizable
operations
in
iowa
biden
will
soon
have
staffers
in
the
state
including
more
than
in
the
field
sanders
has
staffers
on
the
ground
and
warren
has
more
than
staffers
in
the
state
harris
decision
to
add
roughly
staffers
in
iowa
and
spend
more
time
on
the
ground
there
is
a
significant
shift
from
the
campaign
she
ran
this
summer
until
she
arrived
on
thursday
she
was
absent
from
iowa
for
more
than
a
month
her
campaign
says
she'll
be
there
every
week
starting
in
october
speaking
to
reporters
after
a
campaign
stop
in
coralville
harris
said
she'd
be
spending
as
much
time
in
iowa
as
possible
in
the
coming
months
and
joked
that
she
got
very
little
sleep
last
night
trying
to
figure
out
where
my
sweaters
and
my
boots
are
but
she
called
the
decision
to
refocus
her
time
on
iowa
a
tradeoff
that
was
frustrating
for
her
to
make
the
realities
of
the
campaign
i
cannot
only
be
in
iowa
because
south
carolina
is
also
a
state
that
is
very
important
that
i
care
about
harris
said
matt
paul
who
ran
clinton's
iowa
campaign
in
said
harris
team
caught
the
issue
early
enough
give
her
credit
he
said
she
had
a
problem
here
she
hadn't
been
here
in
a
while
she
listened
she
corrected
it
and
she's
coming
here
but
harris
vulnerabilities
aren't
limited
to
iowa
with
much
of
her
summer
spent
on
fundraising
she
had
a
similarly
light
footprint
in
other
early
voting
states
she
campaigned
in
new
hampshire
once
in
the
last
two
months
she
also
hasn't
been
in
south
carolina
where
she's
counting
on
a
strong
showing
among
black
voters
in
two
months
but
plans
to
double
her
organizing
staff
other
candidates
are
also
planning
a
fall
surge
in
iowa
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
has
rapidly
expanded
his
paid
staffers
in
the
state
bringing
his
total
to
one
of
the
field's
most
expansive
iowa
footprints
his
campaign
is
convening
more
than
two
dozen
donors
in
iowa
this
weekend
to
discuss
strategy
according
to
an
aide
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
the
plans
buttigieg
plans
to
crisscross
the
state
by
bus
this
weekend
with
visits
to
smaller
cities
in
central
and
northern
iowa
he's
inviting
the
media
to
join
him
on
the
bus
to
engage
more
casually
than
he
has
in
the
past
sanders
meanwhile
recently
severed
ties
with
his
iowa
political
director
one
of
a
series
of
staff
shake-ups
in
key
early
voting
states
the
campaign
also
replaced
sanders
new
hampshire
state
director
amy
klobuchar
who
has
focused
heavily
on
iowa
since
joining
the
race
is
zeroing
in
this
week
on
a
blue
wall
tour
of
pennsylvania
wisconsin
and
pennsylvania
states
that
supported
democrats
for
decades
before
flipping
to
president
donald
trump
in
the
minnesota
senator
is
stressing
the
similarities
between
her
home
state
and
the
blue
wall
states
and
her
ability
to
win
over
voters
in
areas
that
backed
trump
an
argument
she
says
for
why
she
would
be
the
best
democratic
nominee
o'rourke
is
also
taking
a
wider
view
of
the
map
since
suspending
his
campaign
for
nearly
two
weeks
to
remain
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
after
a
mass
shooting
there
that
killed
people
he's
vowed
to
take
the
quest
to
deny
trump
a
second
term
directly
to
the
president
he's
still
visiting
early
voting
states
but
is
traveling
to
unusual
places
like
the
mississippi
towns
where
recent
immigration
raids
led
to
nearly
people
arrested
and
an
arkansas
gun
show
the
idea
is
to
distinguish
o'rourke
in
a
crowded
field
but
trippi
said
the
strategy
could
prove
fatal
it's
iowa
or
nothing
he
said
touring
every
state
but
the
early
states
is
a
big
mistake
