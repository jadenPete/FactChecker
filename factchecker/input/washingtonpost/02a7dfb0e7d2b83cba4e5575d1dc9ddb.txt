how
a
hard-charging
lawyer
helped
fuel
a
civil
war
inside
the
nra
william
brewer
iii
at
his
office
in
new
york
last
week
jeenah
moon
for
the
washington
post
when
the
national
rifle
association
needed
more
legal
firepower
in
new
york
state
last
year
the
gun
rights
group
brought
aboard
an
unlikely
lawyer
a
democrat
who
had
no
experience
in
second
amendment
litigation
by
this
spring
william
brewer
iii
had
emerged
as
a
top
counselor
to
nra
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
and
a
victor
for
now
at
least
in
a
civil
war
that
he
helped
set
in
motion
and
that
is
ripping
apart
the
powerful
gun
lobby
the
ugly
public
fight
has
led
to
an
exodus
of
high-level
officials
and
warring
accusations
of
financial
impropriety
at
the
center
of
the
fray
is
brewer
a
brash
lawyer
who
has
drawn
ethics
complaints
and
has
a
reputation
for
escalating
disputes
into
pricey
legal
battles
several
nra
veterans
accuse
brewer
of
instigating
an
almost
shakespearean
feud
to
protect
his
bottom
line
and
growing
influence
according
to
internal
board
correspondence
his
small
law
firm
billed
million
in
fees
in
months
leading
top
nra
board
members
to
demand
early
this
year
that
the
organization
stop
paying
until
they
could
review
the
bills
but
lapierre
sided
with
brewer
saying
that
the
lawyer's
bills
were
appropriate
and
that
he
was
bringing
long-overdue
scrutiny
to
the
nonprofit
group's
workings
the
nra
has
full
confidence
in
bill
brewer
and
his
law
firm
lapierre
said
in
a
statement
the
firm
is
creative
dedicated
and
effective
and
is
helping
to
protect
and
advance
the
nra's
interests
in
multiple
venues
brewer
said
he
came
under
attack
once
he
began
examining
lucrative
financial
deals
inside
the
organization
that
he
thought
posed
conflicts
of
interest
his
firm
said
those
complaining
about
its
bills
have
a
misinformed
view
of
its
work
but
declined
to
elaborate
questions
regarding
our
fees
which
arose
almost
one
year
after
we
were
hired
came
only
after
people
who
long
supported
our
firm's
work
themselves
came
under
scrutiny
for
their
conduct
brewer
said
in
a
wide-ranging
interview
last
week
sitting
in
his
suite
on
the
th
floor
of
his
dallas
office
with
soaring
views
of
the
city
nra
money
flowed
to
board
members
amid
allegedly
lavish
spending
by
top
officials
and
vendors
today
after
helping
to
jettison
nra
president
oliver
north
rival
lawyers
and
other
key
nra
lieutenants
brewer
counsels
lapierre
on
some
of
the
group's
most
important
decisions
including
legal
strategy
management
and
public
relations
said
multiple
people
familiar
with
his
role
those
who
have
been
pushed
out
shared
a
common
concern
that
brewer
ran
up
excessive
fees
and
then
cemented
his
role
by
overstating
claims
about
the
organization's
legal
jeopardy
and
the
potential
conflicts
of
his
critics
according
to
the
people
and
internal
documents
with
brewer's
backing
lapierre
this
spring
turned
against
ackerman
mcqueen
the
marketing
firm
that
had
been
the
nra's
image
maker
for
more
than
three
decades
a
company
run
by
brewer's
own
father-in-law
and
brother-in-law
mr
brewer
is
orchestrating
a
purge
of
every
person
who
disagrees
with
his
flawed
strategy
ackerman
mcqueen
said
in
a
statement
brewer
rejected
that
the
truth
is
a
handful
of
faithless
fiduciaries
tried
to
purge
the
nra
of
its
elected
leadership
by
extorting
wayne
lapierre
he
said
they
failed
brewer
whose
eponymous
law
firm
also
has
an
office
in
new
york
has
a
history
of
confrontational
and
high-priced
legal
fights
according
to
former
employees
and
lawyers
who
encountered
him
in
cases
and
a
review
of
thousands
of
pages
of
court
records
ted
lyon
a
personal
injury
lawyer
in
dallas
who
has
battled
brewer
in
the
past
said
he
was
shocked
that
brewer
had
convinced
the
nra
that
he
was
some
type
of
star
litigator
in
a
texas
judge
sanctioned
brewer
finding
that
he
took
actions
that
could
have
improperly
tainted
a
jury
pool
the
court
found
brewer's
attempts
to
avoid
responsibility
and
accountability
for
his
conduct
to
be
at
the
very
least
unpersuasive
and
at
the
worst
in
bad
faith
unprofessional
and
unethical
the
judge
wrote
four
lawyers
associations
filed
a
friend-of-the-court
argument
in
august
in
favor
of
the
punishment
citing
the
sanctity
of
the
promise
of
a
fair
trial
the
legal
groups
said
they
can
imagine
nothing
more
poisonous
to
this
ancient
ideal
than
william
a.
brewer
iii's
behavior
brewer
who
has
appealed
says
his
firm
represents
our
clients
ethically
but
zealously
he
said
he
is
disappointed
that
his
peers
have
lined
up
against
him
but
he
added
it's
not
the
first
time
we've
stood
alone
brewer
does
not
have
the
typical
profile
of
a
lawyer
for
the
nra
one
of
president
trump's
staunchest
allies
campaign
filings
show
that
he
has
donated
to
numerous
democrats
including
barack
obama
hillary
clinton
and
beto
o'rourke
but
in
march
the
nra
was
dealing
with
a
challenge
by
new
york
state
officials
to
its
carry
guard
insurance
which
provides
coverage
to
firearms
owners
who
shoot
someone
and
claim
self-defense
the
state
financial
services
department
found
that
the
nra
had
illegally
marketed
what
critics
call
murder
insurance
insurers
facing
millions
in
state
fines
demand
that
the
organization
cover
the
penalty
the
nra
wanted
a
lawyer
with
ties
to
new
york
democrats
steve
hart
the
nra
board's
lawyer
enlisted
brewer
according
to
people
familiar
with
his
involvement
hart
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
when
new
york
officials
warned
financial
institutions
and
insurers
that
a
relationship
with
the
nra
could
harm
their
corporate
reputations
and
jeopardize
public
safety
brewer
urged
the
nra
to
sue
the
state
arguing
that
state
officials
were
targeting
an
advocacy
group
whose
views
differed
from
their
own
from
there
brewer
pressed
to
take
on
other
matters
said
people
familiar
with
internal
discussions
that
included
the
organization's
response
to
a
broader
threat
at
the
time
letitia
james
the
leading
candidate
to
become
the
new
york
state
attorney
general
was
campaigning
on
a
pledge
to
investigate
the
nra's
nonprofit
status
amid
reports
of
financial
irregularities
brewer
said
he
recommended
to
lapierre
that
he
prepare
by
auditing
the
group's
spending
and
vendor
contracts
including
those
of
ackerman
mcqueen
its
largest
for
years
the
oklahoma
city-based
advertising
agency
had
served
as
a
powerful
adjunct
to
the
nra
promoting
the
group's
combative
no-compromise
stance
on
gun
rights
the
inquiry
put
him
on
a
collision
course
with
his
father-in-law
angus
mcqueen
who
founded
the
firm
mcqueen
a
larger-than-life
figure
like
brewer
and
of
his
generation
died
in
july
brewer
said
he
did
not
view
the
matter
as
a
conflict
of
interest
brewer
said
people
within
the
nra
began
raising
questions
about
ackerman's
billing
and
its
hiring
of
the
group's
officials
such
as
north
north
had
a
multimillion-dollar
contract
to
host
a
series
produced
by
the
firm
documents
show
a
lawyer
for
north
declined
to
comment
the
mcqueens
grew
suspicious
of
brewer's
questions
and
worried
that
he
sought
to
take
over
some
of
the
firm's
public
relations
business
according
to
people
familiar
with
their
views
in
a
statement
ackerman
mcqueen
accused
brewer
of
pursuing
a
personal
vendetta
against
his
own
family
and
their
business
the
firm
said
it
has
cooperated
with
every
audit
requested
by
the
nra
and
never
overcharged
the
group
adding
that
lapierre
approved
all
expenses
the
company
alleges
that
brewer
went
after
ackerman
mcqueen
to
serve
as
a
distraction
from
the
failure
of
nra
executives
and
its
board
to
properly
fulfill
its
oversight
duties
current
nra
officials
rejected
that
saying
the
audit
was
part
of
a
move
to
increase
oversight
brewer's
firm
said
that
the
focus
on
ackerman
was
not
personal
and
that
the
agency
stonewalled
requests
for
information
and
the
firm
dismissed
as
absurd
the
idea
that
it
was
trying
to
steal
the
public
relations
business
the
nra
pursued
documents
from
several
major
vendors
not
just
ackerman
but
ackerman
singularly
resisted
sarah
rogers
a
partner
in
the
brewer
firm
said
in
a
statement
the
audit
set
off
a
bitter
legal
fight
fracturing
the
alliance
between
the
nra
and
its
longtime
marketing
agency
it
also
exposed
lavish
spending
by
lapierre
that
flowed
through
ackerman
mcqueen
such
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
charges
at
a
beverly
hills
clothing
boutique
and
on
foreign
travel
invoices
show
the
nra
has
defended
the
expenditures
as
necessary
nra

of
million
mansion
in
wake
of
parkland
shooting
brewer
in
his
downtown
dallas
office
in
june
shane
kislack
brewer
first
made
a
splash
in
dallas
legal
circles
in
the
s
when
he
co-founded
a
boutique
litigation
firm
that
offered
big
salaries
and
imported
the
brash
tactics
of
brewer's
native
new
york
to
texas
bickel
brewer's
hardball
methods
drew
criticism
from
the
traditional
texas
bar
depositions
were
drawn
out
for
days
as
brewer's
clients
claimed
they
couldn't
say
for
certain
what
their
names
were
where
they
were
born
or
what
they
owned
records
show
judges
complained
about
overly
combative
practices
that
seemed
aimed
at
wearing
down
the
court
and
opposing
counsel
fellow
lawyers
called
them
rambo
tactics
a
term
brewer
embraced
we
don't
believe
we
should
earn
our
living
from
being
nice
to
other
lawyers
brewer
told
the
texas
lawyer
in
a
article
that
described
his
firm
as
the
poster
child
for
scorched-earth
litigation
with
brewer
and
other
lawyers
deploying
such
maneuvers
the
state
bar
sought
to
rein
them
in
and
in
the
texas
supreme
court
adopted
a
new
code
threatening
to
penalize
lawyers
who
perceive
that
they
are
retained
to
win
at
all
costs
without
regard
to
fundamental
principles
of
justice
friends
say
brewer
ruffled
feathers
because
he
challenged
texas's
insular
legal
industry
he
would
do
all
that
was
within
the
bounds
of
ethics
to
advance
the
cause
of
his
client
and
the
cause
of
justice
said
john
sexton
a
former
president
of
new
york
university
and
dean
of
its
law
school
some
clients
too
praised
brewer's
approach
i've
worked
with
bill
for
decades
for
two
reasons
he
delivers
time
and
time
again
and
exemplifies
the
highest
of
ethical
standards
said
howard
meyers
the
head
of
a
global
lead
manufacturing
company
that
hired
brewer
to
fend
off
bondholders
in
a
multibillion-dollar
bankruptcy
fight
but
some
former
associates
said
brewer
sought
to
maximize
fees
at
the
expense
of
clients
in
interviews
former
employees
said
the
brewer
firm
pushed
lawyers
to
generate
big
bills
and
encouraged
make-work
tasks
bill
was
an
excellent
lawyer
from
a
strategy
and
content
standpoint
said
one
lawyer
who
left
the
firm
in
the
s
and
like
others
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
out
of
fear
of
retribution
but
the
lawyer
said
we
would
do
work
that
i
considered
clerical
work
to
meet
the
billing
goals
you
can
always
find
something
more
to
do
it
was
a
lot
more
expensive
for
the
client
michael
j.
collins
a
partner
in
brewer's
firm
called
that
a
misinformed
view
of
the
way
we
manage
the
firm
and
its
professionals
adding
that
all
time
charged
to
client
matters
is
scrutinized
internally
for
accuracy
transparency
and
value
brewer
said
his
fees
reflect
the
value
of
what
he
provides
clients
frankly
i'm
disappointed
some
don't
always
see
the
utility
in
the
way
in
which
we
go
through
the
process
he
said
that's
generally
not
the
clients
at
times
brewer's
process
has
led
to
eye-popping
totals
over
the
years
his
firm
was
paid
million
for
a
wide
variety
of
matters
by
the
wyly
brothers
texas
entrepreneurs
who
made
billions
in
computers
energy
and
retail
according
to
a
family
adviser
when
the
brothers
came
under
federal
investigation
for
the
use
of
offshore
tax
havens
brewer
urged
them
to
fight
the
allegations
even
as
other
wealthy
figures
settled
similar
cases
by
paying
negotiated
fines
according
to
people
involved
in
the
case
and
news
reports
at
the
time
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
ultimately
charged
the
wylys
with
fraudulently
hiding
half
a
billion
dollars
after
the
death
of
charles
wyly
in
the
family
parted
ways
with
brewer
the
brothers
were
ordered
to
pay
million
for
tax
fraud
and
sam
wyly
filed
for
bankruptcy
protection
in
he
and
his
brother's
estate
were
ordered
to
pay
billion
in
back
taxes
and
penalties
a
spokesman
for
the
wylys
declined
to
comment
citing
a
pending
federal
settlement
agreement
brewer
defended
his
work
for
the
family
i
thought
we
successfully
represented
the
wylys
he
said
some
things
turned
out
badly
for
them
after
i
was
no
longer
in
charge
brewer's
methods
also
drew
scrutiny
in
a
case
in
which
he
represented
titeflex
a
pipe
manufacturer
that
had
been
sued
by
the
family
of
a
young
man
who
died
in
a
house
fire
texas
state
judge
ruben
reyes
found
that
brewer's
firm
hired
pollsters
to
conduct
a
telephone
push
poll
that
provided
misleading
information
to
people
involved
in
the
case
and
could
have
tainted
the
trial
the
court
finds
mr
brewer's
conduct
disrespectful
to
the
judicial
system
the
judge
wrote
in
adding
that
it
falls
in
the
category
of
misconduct
which
is
highly
prejudicial
and
inimical
to
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
the
judge
ordered
brewer
to
attend
hours
of
remedial
ethics
classes
and
pay
a
fine
brewer
and
a
fellow
lawyer
who
worked
on
the
case
said
they
were
conducting
a
neutral
survey
to
prepare
for
trial
not
a
push
poll
brewer's
lawyer
citing
experts
in
survey
research
argued
that
brewer
was
using
a
widely
accepted
litigation
tool
brewer
appealed
the
decision
which
was
upheld
and
increased
to
his
second
appeal
is
set
to
be
heard
by
the
texas
supreme
court
next
month
i
just
think
he
was
wrong
brewer
said
of
the
judge
adding
that
he
is
optimistic
that
the
sanction
will
be
reversed
titeflex
ended
up
settling
the
case
with
the
family
and
homeowners
internally
company
officials
complained
that
brewer
delivered
an
unsatisfactory
outcome
while
charging
steep
fees
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
concerns
lyon
who
represented
the
family
that
sued
titeflex
said
brewer
would
send
four
lawyers
to
a
deposition
that
one
lawyer
could
easily
handle
a
titeflex
official
and
the
brewer
firm
declined
to
comment
on
its
fees
in
another
case
a
texas
court
disqualified
brewer
from
a
suit
in
which
he
represented
an
heir
to
the
texas
billionaire
h.l.
hunt
suing
his
father
because
brewer
was
found
to
have
represented
the
father
brewer
said
in
court
papers
that
opposing
counsel
tried
to
push
him
out
for
tactical
reasons
adding
that
his
work
helped
resolve
the
case
in
september
brewer
was
reprimanded
by
a
federal
judge
in
virginia
after
he
did
not
disclose
the
texas
court
sanction
to
a
federal
court
in
virginia
as
he
represented
the
nra
in
a
lawsuit
with
an
insurance
broker
these
are
very
serious
allegations
u.s.
district
judge
liam
o'grady
told
brewer
before
ejecting
him
from
the
case
they're
findings
of
bad
faith
brewer
told
the
washington

that
he
believed
he
disclosed
what
was
necessary
noting
that
the
matter
is
under
appeal

nra

began
warning
about
staggering
legal

from
brewer's
firm
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
communications
since
march
his
firm's
fees
had
routinely
topped
million
a
month
according
to
internal
documents
in
a

richard

told

and
demanded
that
the
nra
cease
payments
to
him
until
they
could
discuss
the
matter
we
have
a
fiduciary

that
needs
to
