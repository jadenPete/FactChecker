president
trump
on
wednesday
toured
a
border
barrier
here
along
the
u.s.
mexico
divide
while
his
top
aides
conducted
a
coast
guard
flyover
of
the
double-layered
steel
fencing
part
of
a
show
of
force
ahead
of
the
election
aimed
reducing
a
massive
spike
in
unauthorized
immigration
trump's
visit
to
the
otay
mesa
area
of
this
border
town
near
tijuana
comes
as
the
administration
has
felt
emboldened
after
winning
new
legal
authority
to
move
forward
in
funding
a
border
wall
and
at
least
temporarily
gaining
additional
powers
to
enforce
restrictions
on
asylum
that
could
help
blunt
a
record
surge
of
central
american
families
capping
a
three-day
road
trip
that
included
a
campaign
rally
in
new
mexico
and
several
campaign
fundraisers
in
california
trump
touted
his
team's
progress
in
completing
a
mile
section
of
replacement
barrier
here
people
are
hearing
about
the
wall
and
they're
not
coming
up
nearly
as
much
trump
told
reporters
while
standing
near
the
foot
steel
bollard
fencing
which
he
called
the
rolls-royce
of
border
walls
people
see
this
it's
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
doing
this
and
they
think
there's
no
reason
to
make
that
long
journey
up
because
we're
not
getting
into
the
united
states
trump
added
as
the
president
ramps
up
his
reelection
bid
his
reliance
on
hard-line
immigration
tactics
represents
an
uncertain
bet
that
deterrence
will
persuade
migrants
to
stay
away
past
trends
however
suggest
that
ebbs
in
migration
patterns
will
be
difficult
to
sustain
in
the
face
of
ongoing
violence
and
poverty
in
central
america
though
the
number
of
arrests
at
the
southern
border
has
plunged
nearly
percent
since
a
year
high
in
the
spring
experts
said
the
progress
has
been
built
on
potentially
unreliable
tools
that
could
prove
temporary
including
increased
cooperation
from
the
governments
in
mexico
and
guatemala
and
court
rulings
the
administration
is
reaching
for
every
lever
they
can
and
some
of
those
are
having
significant
gains
said
david
inserra
a
policy
analyst
at
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
but
the
reality
is
that
the
measures
trump
is
entertaining
are
mostly
executive
agreements
and
court
decisions
on
regulations
all
of
them
can
be
undone
or
undermined
by
new
court
hearings
or
decisions
elsewhere
trump
and
his
advisers
view
the
immigration
efforts
as
a
political
winner
and
the
president
touted
his
policies
during
a
campaign
rally
in
rio
rancho
n.m.
in
a
heavily
latino
state
that
leans
democratic
polls
show
broad
disapproval
from
democrats
over
trump's
handling
of
immigration
while
large
majorities
of
republican
voters
support
his
approach
as
the
presidential
entourage
arrived
here
trump
posted
an
image
on
twitter
with
his
face
superimposed
in
front
of
a
bollard
wall
and
the
message
in
spanish
no
m
s
meaning
no
more
trump's
critics
have
faulted
him
for
trampling
over
long-standing
u.s.
asylum
policies
aimed
at
offering
relief
to
vulnerable
migrants
fleeing
persecution
in
their
homelands
the
administration
has
forced
at
least
migrants
most
of
them
from
central
america
to
remain
in
makeshift
conditions
in
mexican
border
towns
as
their
asylum
cases
are
litigated
under
a
program
called
the
migrant
protection
protocols
or
mpp
and
a
ruling
last
week
from
the
supreme
court
permits
federal
officials
to
enforce
new
regulations
to
deny
asylum
to
those
migrants
as
a
legal
fight
over
the
rules
plays
out
in
court
immigrant
rights
advocates
have
accused
trump
of
employing
draconian
tactics
to
respond
to
a
problem
of
his
own
making
the
number
of
migrants
taken
into
u.s.
custody
at
the
southern
border
peaked
in
may
at
more
than
the
highest
monthly
total
in
a
dozen
years
experts
cited
a
rush
to
cross
the
border
as
trump
unsuccessfully
pursued
other
hard-line
measures
such
as
a
policy
that
resulted
in
the
separation
of
thousands
of
migrant
children
from
their
families
though
migration
numbers
traditionally
dip
in
the
hot
summer
months
federal
officials
have
credited
the
significant
decline
in
border
crossings
since
may
to
the
mpp
program
as
well
as
a
crackdown
from
the
mexican
government
which
under
threats
of
new
tariffs
from
trump
dispatched
thousands
of
national
guard
troops
to
its
northern
and
southern
borders
they're
certainly
showing
us
that
they
are
doing
all
they
can
to
take
credit
and
message
that
the
actions
they've
been
taking
are
bearing
fruit
said
doris
meissner
a
senior
fellow
at
the
migration
policy
institute
who
served
as
at
top
immigration
official
in
the
clinton
administration
is
it
a
durable
solution
that's
another
issue
meissner
added
everything
we
know
about
migration
and
the
way
migration
works
is
that
when
you
have
strong
push
forces
and
when
you
have
strong
pull
forces
things
may
be
interrupted
for
a
while
but
then
there's
adaptation
from
migrants
and
smuggling
networks
trump
aides
defended
their
tactics
as
a
justifiable
emergency
reaction
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
spring
administration
officials
have
faulted
congress
for
failing
to
pass
a
comprehensive
immigration
policy
overhaul
and
pointed
to
the
fast-growing
number
of
asylum
applications
in
recent
years
as
evidence
that
central
american
families
are
abusing
lax
u.s.
policies
most
migrants
who
apply
for
asylum
are
released
into
the
country
while
awaiting
their
court
hearings
which
can
take
months
because
of
lengthy
backlogs
in
addition
to
the
new
asylum
restrictions
the
trump
administration
has
reached
an
agreement
with
guatemala
that
could
compel
migrants
from
el
salvador
and
honduras
who
are
seeking
entrance
to
the
united
states
to
apply
instead
for
asylum
in
that
country
the
cumulative
effect
of
their
efforts
officials
said
is
to
construct
an
obstacle
course
of
physical
legal
and
bureaucratic
hurdles
that
will
drive
down
unauthorized
immigration
trump
administration
officials
have
said
they
expect
to
complete
more
than
miles
of
replacement
and
new
border
barriers
by
the
end
of
but
only
a
small
fraction
of
that
has
been
completed
to
date
the
president
also
has
failed
to
deliver
on
promises
to
get
mexico
to
pay
the
billions
of
dollars
it
is
expected
to
cost
instead
using
emergency
powers
to
tap
into
money
that
was
allocated
to
pentagon
projects
the
pentagon
has
compiled
a
list
of
projects
overseas
that
will
be
eliminated
due
to
the
shift
of
dollars
and
military
officials
have
warned
privately
that
the
moves
could
put
personnel
at
risk
the
interior
department
announced
wednesday
it
was
transferring
administrative
jurisdiction
of
approximately
acres
of
federal
land
to
the
army
to
build
roughly
miles
of
border
barriers
on
tuesday
acting
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
and
several
of
his
senior
aides
visited
a
makeshift
courthouse
in
the
border
town
of
laredo
tex
established
under
the
mpp
program
to
expedite
asylum
hearings
the
first
of
five
planned
facilities
that
could
cost
up
to
million
and
on
wednesday
the
group
conducted
an
aerial
tour
of
the
border
fence
here
there's
a
false
narrative
out
there
that
this
is
the
president's
vanity
wall
said
mark
morgan
acting
commissioner
of
customs
and
border
protection
that's
false
he
reached
out
to
experts
and
agents
on
the
front
lines
immigration
experts
warned
that
trump
is
at
risk
of
prematurely
declaring
victory
in
july
the
trump
administration
cut
millions
of
dollars
in
aid
to
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
where
most
of
the
migrant
families
are
coming
from
a
move
experts
said
could
depress
efforts
in
those
countries
to
improve
economic
and
security
conditions
furthermore
trump's
threats
of
tariffs
to
force
mexico
to
crack
down
on
migrants
have
engendered
widespread
political
opposition
in
that
country
said
alan
bersin
who
served
as
cbp
commissioner
in
the
obama
administration
he
added
that
mexico's
deteriorating
economy
could
propel
more
migrants
from
that
country
to
try
to
cross
the
border
even
if
the
number
of
central
americans
continues
to
drop
but
trump
was
enthusiastic
during
his
tour
when
a
construction
worker
suggested
the
president
join
the
team
in
signing
their
names
on
the
steel
bollard
fencing
the
president
didn't
hesitate
i'll
sign
it
he
said
let's
go
