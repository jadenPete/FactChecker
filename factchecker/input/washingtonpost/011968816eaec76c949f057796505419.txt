said
pelosi
and
other
american
lawmakers
had
confused
right
and
wrong
by
engaging
with
what
he
termed
hong
kong
separatists
we
urge
the
u.s.
to
stop
bolstering
radical
violent
forces
in
hong
kong
that
advocate
hong
kong
independence
and
stop
intensifying
words
and
actions

undermine
the

carrie
lam
and
other
officials
will
hold
their
first
community
dialogue
next
week
with
up
to
members
of
the
public
the
goal
is
to
invite
people
from
all
walks
of
life
to
express
their
views
to
the
government
so
as
to
fathom
the
discontent
in
society
and
to
look
for
solutions
it
said
in
a
statement
lam
had
announced
earlier
that
the
government
would
create
a
platform
for
dialogue
in
a
bid
to
end
the

thanked
them
for
challenging
the
conscience
of
the
chinese
government
and
the
world
pelosi
has
monitored
china
from
her
early
years
in
congress
when
she
appeared
with
other
lawmakers
in
beijing's
tiananmen
square
to
pay
tribute
to
protesters
who
died
in
pro-democracy
protests
this
year's
protesters
believe
that
china
is
eroding
the
rights
and
freedoms
that
hong
kong
has
under
a
one
country
two
systems
framework
that
allows
the
semi-autonomous
city
to
have
its
own
legal
system
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
is
expected
to
advance
legislation
that
would
require
an
annual
review
of
hong
kong's
special
economic
and
trade
status
providing
a
potential
check
on
the
chinese
government's
influence
geng
said
hong
kong
is
an
internal
chinese
issue
and
that
china
accepts
no
interference
in
its
internal
affairs
we
strongly
urge
the
u.s.
to
respect
china's
sovereignty
stop
interfering
in
hong
kong
affairs
in
any
form
and
stop
promoting
the
review
of
relevant
hong
kong-related
proposals
