bernie
sanders
is
still
leading
a
revolution
but
his
ideas
no
longer
feel
quite
so
revolutionary
the
vermont
senator
acknowledges
that
many
of
his
top
proposals
which
were
dismissed
as
radical
four
years
ago
have
been
adopted
by
much
of
the
crowded
democratic
presidential
primary
field
medicare
for
all
tuition-free
college
spending
trillions
to
combat
climate
change
and
a
national
per
hour
minimum
wage
but
he's
out
to
prove
that
his
second
presidential
campaign
is
still
about
fresh
energy
and
ideas
even
if
its
refrains
now
sound
familiar
not
only
can
i
lead
it
i
think
i
am
the
person
to
lead
it
sanders
said
in
an
interview
at
a
plumbers
and
pipefitters
union
hall
in
las
vegas
when
asked
if
he
could
helm
a
revolution
when
so
many
of
his
presidential
rivals
agree
with
him
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
look
at
somebody
who
four
years
ago
had
the
courage
to
break
new
ground
in
this
country
he
added
we're
continuing
to
break
new
ground
today
but
there
are
signs
that
may
not
be
enough
the
campaign
is
restructuring
its
staff
in
key
early
voting
states
as
the
year-old
sanders
faces
crosscurrents
that
weren't
in
play
four
years
ago
no
longer
the
sole
progressive
alternative
to
an
overwhelming
favorite
in
hillary
clinton
sanders
is
one
of
several
candidates
making
explicit
appeals
to
the
party's
left
wing
this
time
his
rivals
have
taken
him
seriously
from
the
start
a
sign
of
his
name
recognition
but
also
a
status
that
subjects
sanders
to
more
scrutiny
and
criticism
than
at
this
stage
of
the
campaign
and
some
of
sanders
younger
competitors
are
calling
for
generational
change
an
issue
that
could
resonate
because
of
questions
raised
about
the
readiness
for
the
presidency
of
another
senior
candidate
year-old
former
vice
president
joe
biden
not
all
democrats
have
embraced
sanders
core
principles
kamala
harris
is
a
co-sponsor
of
his
medicare
for
all
legislation
but
the
california
senator
now
says
she
doesn't
favor
its
call
to
scrap
all
private
health
insurance
biden
the
early
front-runner
in
the
primary
has
repeatedly
hammered
sanders
over
the
plan's
costs
few
candidates
line
up
more
closely
with
sanders
than
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
while
they
don't
agree
on
everything
warren
is
such
a
fan
of
medicare
for
all
that
she's
repeatedly
declared
i'm
with
bernie
when
it
comes
to
health
care
because
they
agree
on
so
much
warren
is
becoming
a
growing
threat
to
sanders
she
packed
tens
of
thousands
of
supporters
into
new
york's
washington
square
park
on
monday
harkening
back
to
sanders
success
in
attracting
massive
crowds
on
the
same
day
she
picked
up
an
endorsement
from
the
progressive
working
families
party
which
backed
sanders
first
campaign
a
national
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
released
tuesday
found
warren
leading
sanders
among
democratic
primary
voters
to
biden
still
came
out
on
top
at
sanders
is
in
second
behind
biden
in
other
national
and
early
state
surveys
sanders
is
working
to
fortify
his
campaign
recently
parting
ways
with
his
political
director
in
iowa
which
holds
the
nation's
first
caucus
and
replacing
his
state
director
in
new
hampshire
a
state
critical
to
sanders
efforts
given
his
landslide
primary
victory
there
in
they
have
some
challenges
brian
fallon
who
was
chief
spokesman
for
clinton's
presidential
campaign
said
of
sanders
team
in
a
binary
race
there
were
a
lot
of
people
who
united
around
an
alternative
to
clinton
there
continue
to
be
true
blue
bernie
supporters
and
that
probably
gives
him
the
most
stubborn
floor
of
support
of
any
candidate
but
those
numbers
are
smaller
the
non-establishment
vote
is
spread
around
sanders
rejected
the
notion
that
the
primary
may
eventually
force
liberal
democrats
to
choose
between
him
and
warren
saying
i
think
that
sen
warren
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
is
running
her
campaign
we
are
running
our
campaign
warren
has
similarly
praised
her
longtime
friendship
with
sanders
rather
than
answer
questions
about
whether
a
showdown
is
coming
still
there
are
questions
about
how
long
the
holding
pattern
can
last
on
sunday
sanders
will
travel
to
oklahoma
where
he'll
attend
a
comanche
nation
fair
powwow
while
he's
not
expected
to
directly
talk
about
warren
the
trip
will
take
sanders
to
her
native
state
a
month
after
she
apologized
to
native
americans
over
her
past
claim
to
tribal
heritage
sanders
has
also
gotten
more
aggressive
with
biden
lately
ticking
through
a
list
of
the
former
vice
president's
unpopular
votes
while
he
was
in
the
senate
including
supporting
the
wall
street
bank
bailout
with
just
over
four
months
before
primary
voting
begins
sanders
said
he
doesn't
believe
anyone
in
so
crowded
a
field
will
carry
states
with
of
the
vote
so
the
question
is
who
is
going
to
get
the
of
the
vote
that
you
need
to
carry
the
states
he
said
i
think
that
because
of
our
strong
grassroots
movement
we
are
in
a
strong
position
to
do
that
sanders
advisers
meanwhile
argue
that
his
appeal
now
goes
beyond
political
insurgency
noting
that
he
campaigned
hard
for
clinton
after
the
primary
and
that
he
has
begun
working
more
closely
with
state
parties
this
cycle
trying
to
build
support
through
traditional
channels
fallon
also
noted
that
sanders
has
been
ahead
of
many
of
his
rivals
on
things
like
joining
striking
mcdonald's
workers
in
iowa
giving
him
revolutionary
political
cred
that
rises
above
policy
overlap
with
other
candidates
with
the
bernie
crowd
that's
the
space
to
say
don't
settle
for
imitators
fallon
said
a
lot
of
sanders
central
message
remains
the
same
though
and
still
appeals
to
voters
i
think
i've
heard
a
lot
of
what
he's
said
already
said
alejandro
hernandez
jr
a
year-old
federal
employee
who
saw
sanders
at
a
recent
latino
issues
forum
in
las
vegas
but
just
to
see
his
actual
energy
and
presence
the
way
he
commands
the
room
and
really
the
elegance
with
which
he
speaks
it's
truly
impressive
