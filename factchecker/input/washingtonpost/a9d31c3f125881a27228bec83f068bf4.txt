senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
on
thursday
expressed
support
for
providing
states
with
an
additional
million
in
election
security
funding
an
abrupt
turnaround
after
more
than
a
year
of
opposition
from
the
kentucky
republican
on
the
issue
mcconnell
who
has
been
derided
by
democrats
as
moscow
mitch
for
repeatedly
blocking
efforts
to
combat
russian
interference
in
u.s.
elections
announced
his
position
in
remarks
on
the
senate
floor
thursday
morning
i'm
proud
the
financial
services
and
the
general
government
bill
included
a
bipartisan
amendment
providing
another
million
from
the
administration
to
help
states
improve
their
defenses
and
shore
up
their
voting
systems
mcconnell
said
i'm
proud
to
have
helped
develop
this
amendment
and
co-sponsor
it
in
committee
that
will
bring
our
total
allocation
for
election
security
listen
to
this
to
more
than
million
since
fiscal
he
added
democrats
hailed
the
news
but
said
more
needs
to
be
done
senate
republicans
shoot
down
extra
funds
for
election
security
leader
mcconnell
kept
saying
we
don't
need
the
money
senate
minority
leader
charles
e.
schumer
d-n
y.
said
on
the
senate
floor
thursday
i
made
umpteen
speeches
here
at
this
chair
and
the
republican
leader
denied
the
need
but
now
thank
god
he
has
seen
the
light
we
need
more
money
for
election
security
ask
election
officials
democrat
or
republican
throughout
the
country
mcconnell
spokesman
doug
andres
said
schumer
was
mischaracterizing
the
republican
leader's
position
and
maintained
that
the
amendment
was
really
a
continuation
of
previous
years
funding
the
senate
appropriations
committee
agreed
by
bipartisan
voice
vote
thursday
to
add
the
million
for
election
security
grants
to
a
spending
bill
covering
financial
services
and
general
government
operations
a
final
figure
would
have
to
be
negotiated
with
the
house
which
has
approved
million
and
the
compromise
legislation
would
have
to
be
passed
by
both
chambers
in
august
senate
republicans
voted
down
an
effort
to
direct
an
extra
million
toward
election
security
ahead
of
the
midterms
at
the
time
only
one
republican
sen
bob
corker
tenn
voted
for
the
additional
funds
senate
republicans
including
mcconnell
have
also
blocked
numerous
democratic
efforts
to
bring
election
security
legislation
to
the
floor
including
measures
that
would
have
authorized
funding
to
update
voting
equipment
congress
did
not
agree
to
any
election
security
spending
in
fiscal
mcconnell
has
defended
republican
moves
to
block
the
bills
by
arguing
that
congress
and
the
trump
administration
have
already
taken
steps
to
combat
foreign
interference
last
year
for
instance
congress
approved
million
to
improve
election
security
systems
the
senate
also
passed
legislation
to
bar
people
who
have
interfered
with
u.s.
elections
from
obtaining
visas
to
enter
the
united
states
mcconnell
defends
blocking
election
security
bill
rejects
criticism
he
is
aiding
russia
andres
disputed
the
notion
that
thursday's
statement
represented
a
turnaround
arguing
that
mcconnell's
approach
has
been
consistent
in
providing
funding
to
the
states
through
the
appropriations
process
the
house-passed
legislation
he
added
has
strings
attached
to
its
funding
and
is
an
election
reform
bill
designed
to
look
like
election
security
current
and
former
trump
administration
officials
have
continued
to
sound
the
alarm
that
more
needs
to
be
done
in
his
testimony
before
congress
in
july
former
special
counsel
robert
s.
mueller
iii
warned
that
foreign
election
interference
efforts
were
happening
as
we
sit
in
the
hearing
rooms
on
thursday
schumer
touched
on
those
exhortations
noting
that
lawmakers
have
been
warned
time
and
again
by
our
national
security
leaders
nearly
all
of
them
republicans
appointed
by
president
trump
that
china
and
of
course
russia
are
potential
threats
in
democrats
on
the
senate
appropriations
committee
echoed
schumer's
remarks
arguing
that
the
funds
are
critical
to
national
security
we
know
that
the
russian
government
interfered
in
the
presidential
election
targeted
our
election
infrastructure
this
problem
was
not
isolated
to
and
we
cannot
be
complacent
now
said
sen
patrick
j.
leahy
vt
the
top
democrat
on
the
panel
which
is
led
by
sen
richard
c.
shelby

on
election
security
eric
rosenbach
a
former
pentagon
chief
of
staff
who
directs
harvard
university's
defending
digital
democracy
program
also
praised
the
turnaround
from
mcconnell
saying
the
initial
funding
was
insufficient
to
arm
states
against
possible
intrusions
from
nation-state
actors
it's
a
sign
that
even
mitch
mcconnell
believes
this
is
a
serious
issue
rosenbach
said
in
an
interview
attributing
the
move
less
to
pressure
from
democratic
lawmakers
than
to
what
he
described
as
the
plain
fact
that
the
nation's
election
infrastructure
is
insufficiently
resilient
even
mcconnell
needs
to
set
politics
aside
and
do
what's
right
for
the
country
mcconnell
meanwhile
argued
that
the
trump
administration
has
made
enormous
strides
to
help
states
secure
their
elections
without
giving
washington
new
power
to
push
the
states
around
that's
how
we
continued
the
progress
we
saw
in
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
doing
he
said
in
his
floor
remarks
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
positive
outcome
that
is
possible
when
we
stop
posturing
for
the
press
and
let
chairman
shelby
and
senator
leahy
conduct
a
bipartisan
committee
process
sen
james
lankford
r-okla
offered
a
note
of
caution
noting
that
much
of
the
money
provided
to
states
in
remains
unspent
and
arguing
that
more
oversight
is
needed
we're
just
handing
states
money
and
they're
glad
to
take
it
but
we're
not
even
requiring
they
spend
it
at
this
point
said
lankford
who
sits
on
the
appropriations
committee
the
money
that
was
allocated
in
spring
has
all
been
distributed
to
the
states
which
were
given
five
years
to
spend
it
according
to
thomas
hicks
head
of
the
u.s.
election
assistance
commission
most
of
them
have
spent
it
on
cybersecurity
and
new
voting
equipment
and
we
need
more
hicks

at
a
symposium

commission
