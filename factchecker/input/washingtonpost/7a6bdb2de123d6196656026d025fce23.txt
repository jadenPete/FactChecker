the
u.s.
military
has
spent
more
than
at
president
trump's
golf
resort
in
scotland
since
he
took
office
far
more
than
previously
known
according
to
documents
released
wednesday
by
the
house
oversight
committee
the
figure
was
disclosed
in
letters
exchanged
between
the
pentagon
and
top
democrats
on
the
committee
which
is
probing
whether
trump
has
violated
a
constitutional
provision
that
prevents
presidents
from
enriching
themselves
through
the
office
the
air
force
has
used
glasgow
prestwick
airport
with
greater
frequency
during
trump's
presidency
placing
some
of
its
crews
at
trump
turnberry
which
is
about
miles
away
during
overnight
stopovers
in
scotland
in
a
letter
dated
wednesday
leaders
of
the
democratic-led
committee
voiced
frustration
with
the
limited
scope
of
a
response
last
week
from
the
pentagon
to
requests
for
detailed
information
on
the
cost
of
the
stays
although
the
department's
response
is
belated
and
deficient
it
still
reveals
that
far
more
taxpayer
funds
have
been
spent
at
the
president's
resort
than
previously
known
said
the
letter
signed
by
house
oversight
chairman
elijah
e.
cummings
d-md
and
rep
jamie
raskin
d-md
a
subcommittee
chairman
air
force
reviewing
layover
guidelines
amid
scrutiny
of
stops
at
trump
property
in
scotland
the
congressmen
said
information
provided
by
the
pentagon
indicated
that
taxpayer
funds
had
been
used
to
pay
for
more
than
three
dozen
separate
stays
significantly
more
than
have
come
to
light
in
recent
news
coverage
the
letter
from
the
pentagon
relayed
that
it
had
tallied
in
expenditures
specifically
associated
with
the
trump
turnberry
the
letter
said
that
amounted
to
an
average
of
per
overnight
stay
which
it
said
was
significantly
less
than
an
allowable
per
diem
the
pentagon
also
identified
an
additional
in
expenditures
that
the
house
oversight
committee
leaders
said
was
associated
with
turnberry
in
their
letter
wednesday
cummings
and
raskin
wrote
that
it
appears
that
u.s.
taxpayer
funds
were
used
to
purchase
the
equivalent
of
more
than
rooms
at
the
trump
turnberry
just
since
august
or
the
equivalent
of
one
room
every
night
for
more
than
one-and-a-half
years
the
congressmen
said
that
the
pentagon
had
not
provided
the
total
number
of
rooms
that
were
booked
nor
the
actual
rates
that
were
paid
the
total
spent
by
the
air
force
at
trump's
turnberry
resort
is
a
small
percentage
of
the
hotel's
total
revenue
in
the
most
recent
year
for
which
data
is
available
the
club
reported
receiving
about
million
from
customers
the
air
force
receipts
amounted
to
over
two
years
at
that
rate
they
would
be
roughly
percent
of
the
hotel's
total
annual
revenue
trump's
own
trip
to
turnberry
in
produced
at
least
in
federal
spending
by
the
state
department
at
the
trump-owned
property
according
to
data
posted
by
the
u.s.
government
trump
bought
the
famous
club
which
has
rooms
in
the
president
has
now
spent
at
least
million
on
the
property
without
any
sign
that
he's
taken
out
loans
to
finance
that
spending
under
trump's
ownership
the
resort
has
lost
million
and
never
reported
turning
a
profit
according
to
filings
with
the
british
government
earlier
this
month
the
air
force
announced
a
review
of
its
selection
of
lodging
accommodations
amid
heightened
scrutiny
of
its
decision
to
place
crews
at
trump's
property
acknowledging
that
it
might
be
allowable
but
not
advisable
in
a
statement
brig
gen
edward
thomas
jr
an
air
force
spokesman
said
the
service's
leadership
had
asked
the
service's
air
mobility
command
to
examine
rules
regarding
how
air
force
personnel
select
destinations
for
overseas
stopovers
he
said
there
was
no
initial
indication
of
wrongdoing
during
stopovers
in
scotland
even
when
air
force
aircrews
follow
all
directives
and
guidance
we
must
still
be
considerate
of
perceptions
of
not
being
good
stewards
of
taxpayer
funds
that
might
be
created
through
the
appearance
of
aircrew
staying
at
such
locations
he
said
