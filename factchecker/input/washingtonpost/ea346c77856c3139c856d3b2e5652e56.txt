visits

on

carolyn
cole
ap
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
unveiled
his
plan
thursday
for
federal
legalization
of
marijuana
which
includes
a
tax
on
the
industry
to
fund
a
monthly
stipend
to
repay
people
who
served
prison
time
on
nonviolent
marijuana
charges
the
former
congressman
from
texas
would
combine
a
newly
regulated
marijuana
market
with
restitution
for
policies
that
resulted
in
lengthy
prison
time
for
low-level
drug
crimes
the
goal
is
to
see
that
those
who
were
harmed
by
the
strict
war
on
drugs
policies
of
the
past
can
now
benefit
from
the
money
made
in
the
marijuana
business
we
need
to
not
only
end
the
prohibition
on
marijuana
but
also
repair
the
damage
done
to
the
communities
of
color
disproportionately
locked
up
in
our
criminal
justice
system
or
locked
out
of
opportunity
because
of
the
war
on
drugs
o'rourke
said
in
a
statement
o'rourke's
tax
would
seek
to
fund
a
monthly
grant
program
he
calls
the
drug
war
justice
grant
which
would
be
given
to
people
who
were
incarcerated
for
marijuana
offenses
the
grants
would
be
offered
for
a
period
of
time
based
on
how
long
they
were
in
prison
the
tax
money
would
also
support
substance
abuse
treatment
programs
and
assist
those
affected
by
marijuana
laws
with
housing
and
job
support
as
well
as
provide
help
for
breaking
into
the
marijuana
business
most
of
the
democratic
primary
field
supports
legalization
of
marijuana
reflecting
a
sea
change
in
public
opinion
on
the
issue
yet
o'rourke
goes
even
further
joining
sens
cory
booker
n.j.
and
kamala
d.
harris
calif
in
calling
for
those
convicted
of
marijuana
possession
to
have
their
criminal
records
expunged
o'rourke's
plan
would
also
no
longer
allow
marijuana
charges
to
be
considered
grounds
for
denying
citizenship
or
deporting
immigrants
the
presidential
candidate
regularly
talks
about
legalization
on
the
campaign
trail
o'rourke
publicly
supported
decriminalizing
marijuana
long
before
it
was
considered
politically
advantageous
as
an
el
paso
city
councilor
in
he
sponsored
a
resolution
calling
on
congress
to
have
a
debate
about
legalizing
narcotics
he
later
wrote
a
book
with
a
fellow
councilor
explaining
their
support
for
marijuana
legalization
through
the
lens
of
living
across
the
border
from
juarez
mexico
