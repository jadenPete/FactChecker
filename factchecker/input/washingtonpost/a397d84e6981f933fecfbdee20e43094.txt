president
trump
traveled
to
california
this
week
where
he
participated
in
fundraisers
and
checked
on
the
progress
of
construction
of
a
wall
along
the
border
with
mexico
while
a
handful
of
his
senior
officials
were
also
visiting
the
state
this
week
to
seek
solutions
to
its
rampant
homelessness
problem
trump
himself
did
not
schedule
any
official
activities
on
the
issue
he
did
comment
on
the
problem
in
the
state's
two
largest
cities
in
ways
that
offended
leaders
of
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
and
demonstrated
his
ability
to
tap
into
the
culture
wars
dividing
urban
and
rural
americans
here's
what
the
washington
post's
jeff
stein
and
phillip
rucker
reported
tuesday
on
wednesday
the
president
threatened
to
issue
a
notice
of
environmental
violation
to
san
francisco
for
its
homelessness
problem
arguing
that
feces
on
public
streets
and
drug
needles
in
the
ocean
are
an
environmental
hazard
it's
a
terrible
situation
that's
in
los
angeles
and
in
san
francisco
trump
told
reporters
wednesday
aboard
air
force
one
as
he
returned
to
washington
we're
going
to
be
giving
san
francisco
they're
in
total
violation
we're
going
to
be
giving
them
a
notice
very
soon
we
can't
have
our
cities
going
to
hell
he
added
san
francisco's
mayor
called
those
ridiculous
assertions
the
president
is
not
known
for
his
deep
concern
for
environmental
issues
and
his
discussion
about
homelessness
tends
to
center
on
aesthetics
and
sanitation
concerns
but
he
has
made
a
habit
of
lamenting
the
condition
of
u.s.
cities
a
demographic
that
the
native
new
yorker
lost
in
and
is
likely
to
lose
again
in
since
trump
launched
his
campaign
some
of
his
harshest
critics
have
been
democratic
leaders
of
liberal
cities
be
they
the
mayors
of
atlanta
and
chicago
or
lawmakers
representing
districts
in
san
francisco
and
houston
liberal
leaders
have
attacked
trumpism
as
bad
for
the
united
states
democratic
presidential
candidate
and
new
york
mayor
bill
de
blasio
went
as
far
as
to
say
that
trump
won't
even
be
welcomed
back
to
the
city
of
his
birth
after
his
presidency
ends
but
the
president
always
a
fighter
frequently
jabs
back
in
july
trump
grabbed
headlines
when
he
disparaged
baltimore
while
attacking
rep
elijah
e.
cummings
d-md
a
frequent
trump
critic
who
as
chairman
of
the
house
oversight
and
reform
committee
has
initiated
most
of
the
investigations
into
the
trump
administration's
operations
and
policies
his
district
is
considered
the
worst
in
the
usa
trump
tweeted
cumming
district
is
a
disgusting
rat
and
rodent
infested
mess
if
he
spent
more
time
in
baltimore
maybe
he
could
help
clean
up
this
very
dangerous
filthy
place
that
same
month
the
president
argued
on
fox
news
that
new
york
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
are
public
health
hazards
police
officers
are
getting
sick
just
by
walking
the
beat
trump
claimed
we
cannot
ruin
our
cities
and
you
have
people
that
work
in
those
cities
they
work
in
office
buildings
and
to
get
into
the
building
they
have
to
walk
through
a
scene
that
nobody
would
have
believed
possible
three
years
ago
it
is
true
that
both
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
have
a
major
homelessness
problem
the
post's
allyson
chiu
reported
that
the
homeless
populations
in
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
have
increased
in
recent
years
according
to
official
data
from
both
cities
this
year
san
francisco's
homeless
population
is
at
while
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
last
week
rolling
stone
reported
but
rural
america
has
an
issue
with
homelessness
too
a
may
study
from
harvard
university
reported
that
in
rural
americans
say
homelessness
is
a
problem
in
their
communities
baltimore
has
been
named
the
country's
most
dangerous
city
but
the
latest
fbi
stats
on
murder
rape
and
aggravated
assault
show
that
while
crime
rates
are
lower
in
rural
america
those
areas
of
the
country
are
not
immune
to
violence
the
post's
david
nakamura
previously
reported
that
city
leaders
see
trump's
indictment
of
cities
as
an
extension
of
a
presidency
rooted
in
expanding
divisions
along
racial
ethnic
and
geographic
lines
his
spewing
of
white-supremacist
rhetoric
is
unending
oakland
mayor
libby
schaaf
d
told
nakamura
i
fear
that
the
rhetoric
will
only
get
louder
and
more
hateful
the
closer
we
get
to
the
election
the
trump
administration
has
shown
some
interest
in
the
problem
beyond
rhetoric
the
administration
released
a
report
on
the
state
of
homelessness
this
week
and
housing
secretary
ben
carson
visited
a
san
francisco
housing
development
tuesday
for
homeless
people
but
exaggerating
the
urban-rural
divide
is
also
probably
a
high
priority
for
the
president
who
considers
himself
a
culture
warrior
even
as
some
leaders
have
worked
hard
to
revitalize
cities
voters
in
trump's
base
often
view
urban
areas
as
unsafe
hubs
of
criminal
activity
leading
the
shift
to
a
more
liberal
america
the
trump
campaign
has
been
vocal
about
its
focus
on
increasing
turnout
among
those
who
already
approve
of
the
president
and
part
of
that
strategy
includes
appealing
to
the
cultural
anxieties
of
those
voters
whose
vision
of
a
great
america
look
very
different
from
what
is
often
reflected
in
the
country's
urban
areas
