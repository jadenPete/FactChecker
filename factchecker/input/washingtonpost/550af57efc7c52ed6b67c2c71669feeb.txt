the
rationale
for

who
was
accused
of
perjury
and
obstruction
of
justice
in
a
case
stemming
from
sexual
misconduct
allegations
in
response
a
clinton
defense
lawyer
named
max
stier
who
had
attended
yale
university
with
kavanaugh
co-signed
a
document
ridiculing
the
idea
of
removing
the
president
over
vague
and
nonspecific
accusations
two
decades
later
the
paths
of
kavanaugh
and
stier
crossed
again
and
once
more
the
matter
involved
alleged
sexual
misconduct
by
this
time
kavanaugh
had
been
nominated
to
the
supreme
court
and
stier
was
the
president
and
chief
executive
of
the
washington-based
partnership
for
public
service
stier
wanted
to
tell
the
fbi
anonymously
that
he
recalled
having
seen
kavanaugh
with
his
pants
down
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
where
friends
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
the
new
york
times
reported
online
saturday
the
student
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
said
she
doesn't
recall
the
event
according
to
an
updated
version
of
the
times
story
as
a
result
stier
finds
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
partisan
brawl
at
the
very
time
he
has
stressed
that
nonpartisanship
is
crucial
to
fixing
what
is
broken
in
washington
he
has
been
attacked
and
supported
on
social
media
on
the
basis
of
the
stier
account
and
related
revelations
some
democrats
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
or
at
least
for
a
new
investigation
president
trump
has
tweeted
what's
happening
to
justice
kavanaugh
is
a
disgrace
stier
a
registered
democrat
who
has
worked
for
members
of
both
political
parties
declined
to
comment
he
may
be
best
known
for
being
portrayed
heroically
as
an
earnest
do-gooder
seeking
to
fix
government
in
a
recent
best-selling
book
the
fifth
risk
by
michael
lewis
stier
might
have
been
the
american
with
the
greatest
understanding
of
how
the
us
government
worked
lewis
wrote
as
soon
as
stier's
role
in
the
kavanaugh
matter
was
revealed
however
some
republicans
latched
on
to
his
having
worked
for
clinton
saying
that
it
signals
he
may
have
had
political
motivations
when
he
offered
the
fbi
information
about
kavanaugh's
days
at
yale
it
is
very
relevant
to
potential
motivation
and
thus
newsworthy
that
max
stier
just
happened
to
be
a
defense
attorney
during
the
impeachment
proceedings
against
president
clinton
when
brett
kavanaugh
was
lead
prosecutor
said
mike
davis
who
was
the
chief
counsel
to
then-senate
judiciary
committee
chairman
charles
e.
grassley
r-iowa
during
the
kavanaugh
confirmation
fight
it
showed
max
stier
may
have
a
political
ax
to
grind
but
another
clinton
impeachment
lawyer
david
kendall
who
worked
closely
on
the
case
with
stier
as
well
as
serving
with
him
at
the
washington
firm
of
williams
connolly
said
stier's
work
should
not
be
cast
as
a
partisan
mission
lawyers
represent
clients
kendall
said
in
this
case
max
was
on
the
side
of
the
president
brett
was
on
the
side
of
the
independent
counsel
i
don't
think
taking
opposing
positions
in
formal
litigations
necessarily
means
there
is
an
any
animus
between
the
opposing
counsel
stier
had
hoped
that
the
fbi
would
interview
witnesses
and
report
to
congress
while
he
remained
anonymous
according
to
associates
he
was
very
very
hesitant
to
come
forward
said
sen
christopher
a.
coons
d-del
who
talked
with
stier
about
the
matter
in
early
autumn
and
passed
his
name
to
the
fbi
because
he
was
concerned
about
exactly
what
is
happening
now
he
was
concerned
that
it
would
harm
the
mission
of
his
organization
that
he
would
be
mischaracterized
as
being
politically
motivated
the
paths
of
stier
and
kavanaugh
have
crossed
several
times
stier
who
was
born
in
california
interned
in
the
office
of
rep
jim
leach
r-iowa
before
attending
yale
where
he
and
kavanaugh
were
classmates
it
was
then
during
the
academic
year
that
stier
allegedly
witnessed
the
sexual
misconduct
described
mainly
in
two
paragraphs
of
the
education
of
brett
kavanaugh
the
book
published
tuesday
by
two
new
york
times
reporters
as
stier
attended
law
school
at
stanford
kavanaugh
was
earning
his
law
degree
at
yale
stier
and
kavanaugh
continued
to
follow
similar
paths
as
both
clerked
for
justices
of
the
supreme
court
kavanaugh
clerked
for
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
term
stier
clerked
for
justice
david
souter
in
the
following
term
both
justices
were
nominated
by
republican
presidents
then
they
both
worked
for
high-powered
washington
law
firms
kavanaugh
went
to
work
for
kirkland
ellis
and
stier
joined
williams
connolly
their
paths
soon
intersected
again
kavanaugh
joined
the
office
of
the
independent
counsel
overseen
by
starr
who
was
investigating
a
number
of
matters
involving
president
clinton
stier
meanwhile
was
asked
by
kendall
a
colleague
at
williams
connolly
to
help
defend
clinton
a
review
of
legal
records
shows
that
stier
and
kavanaugh
were
on
opposing
sides
in
a
number
of
clinton-related
cases
in
they
faced
off
on
the
question
of
whether
the
independent
counsel
could
compel
the
testimony
of
deputy
white
house
counsel
bruce
lindsey
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
ruled
for
kavanaugh's
side
saying
the
white
house
could
not
assert
attorney-client
privilege
if
the
president's
lawyer
had
information
related
to
possible
criminal
violations
shortly
thereafter
kavanaugh
wrote
a
memo
outlining
questions
that
the
independent
counsel
should
ask
clinton
including
whether
the
president
thought
the
intern
monica
lewinsky
was
lying
when
she
described
her
sexual
activities
with
clinton
kavanaugh
then
was
the
primary
author
of
the
section
of
starr's
report
on
possible
grounds
for
impeaching
clinton
the
house
voted
to
impeach
clinton
and
the
senate
convened
to
vote
on
whether
to
convict
the
president
stier
was
part
of
the
clinton
defense
team
that
produced
a
memorandum
urging
the
senate
not
to
remove
the
president
a
view
that
prevailed
in
the
senate
stier
went
on
to
work
as
a
lawyer
in
the
clinton
administration
but
his
experience
watching
the
impeachment
battle
and
other
partisan
fights
led
him
to
think
about
developing
nonpartisan
solutions
for
making
government
work
better
as
it
happened
stier
met
a
financier
named
sam
heyman
a
republican
former
assistant
u.s.
attorney
who
wanted
to
back
a
group
dedicated
to
promoting
public
service
heyman
provided
million
in
to
fund
the
partnership
for
public
service
and
million
later
stier
was
put
in
charge
of
the
operation
which
has
grown
to
a
full-time
staff
of
and
dozens
of
interns
the
partnership
has
a
singular
goal
to
make
the
federal
government
more
effective
and
efficient
by
attracting
and
engaging
the
best
workforce
possible
at
the
core
are
managers
who
are
good
leaders
when
government
fails
the
group's
motto
goes
it
is
because
managers
were
not
doing
their
jobs
besides
its
research
team
devoted
to
finding
trends
in
government
and
its
leadership
seminars
for
managers
the
group
is
best
known
for
tworecognition
programs
for
federal
employees
one
is
the
annual
awards
known
as
the
sammies
which
honor
federal
employees
nominated
by
their
peers
and
supervisors
who
have
led
the
way
in
their
fields
the
other
is
the
annual
best
places
to
work
in
the
federal
government
rankings
which
rate
federal
agencies
from
cabinet
level
to
tiny
offices
the
results
released
in
december
are
closely
watched
by
managers
throughout
the
government
the
group
also
works
with
the
washington
post
to
publish
a
database
of
how
many
key
positions
are
filled
in
the
trump
administration
john
palguta
who
was
the
partnership's
vice
president
for
policy
for
years
said
stier
set
the
nonpartisan
tone
if
he
would
hear
folks
talking
about
anything
that
was
partisan
he
would
put
a
stop
to
it
palguta
said
sen
richard
blumenthal
d-conn
said
stier
is
very
unpretentious
unassuming
matter-of-fact
dedicated
to
public
service
but
not
to
partisan
politics
stier's
wife
d.c.
superior
court
associate
judge
florence
y.
pan
who
had
clerked
for
judges
appointed
by
republicans
was
nominated
in
by
president
barack
obama
to
be
a
u.s.
district
judge
for
the
district
of
columbia
her
nomination
was
unanimously
advanced
from
the
senate
judiciary
committee
but
like
a
number
of
those
put
forward
in
the
last
year
of
obama's
presidency
pan's
nomination
languished
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
and
was
never
put
to
a
vote
with
the
election
of
president
trump
she
was
not
renominated
trump
meanwhile
nominated
kavanaugh
to
the
supreme
court
prompting
a
summerlong
fight
between
democrats
and
republicans
after
allegations
surfaced
that
he
had
sexually
assaulted
a
woman
named
christine
blasey
ford
at
a
home
when
he
attended
georgetown
preparatory
school
kavanaugh
denied
the
allegation
stier
got
in
touch
with
coons
the
senator
sat
on
the
judiciary
committee
and
had
met
stier
at
one
of
the
partnership's
awards
ceremonies
in
the
first
of
at
least
two
conversations
stier
was
gravely
concerned
about
coming
forward
with
his
recollection
about
the
dorm
incident
involving
kavanaugh
because
of
concern
it
might
taint
the
partnership
as
partisan
coons
said
and
he
did
not
come
forward
he
did
not
think
the
risk
was
worth
it
coons
said
in
an
interview
but
after
blasey
ford
testified
that
kavanaugh
had
sexually
assaulted
her
and
her
testimony
was
questioned
by
republicans
stier
again
telephoned
coons
with
the
fbi
set
to
spend
a
week
investigating
other
claims
against
kavanaugh
stier
agreed
to
let
coons
write
to
the
bureau
and
urge
that
investigators
speak
with
stier
about
his
information
coons
asked
of
fbi
director
christopher
a.
wray
in
an
oct
letter
that
an
appropriate
follow
up
be
made
with
stier
but
stier
was
never
interviewed
by
the
fbi
a
revelation
from
the
new
book
that
infuriated
multiple
democratic
senators
who
complained
about
the
narrow
scope
of
the
background
investigation
that
concern
festered
and
the
wound
was
reopened
with
stier's
account
what
we
were
looking
for
was
an
honest
professional
investigation
