the

to

president
barack
obama's

in
a
conservative
state
that

the
billion-plus
medicaid
expansion
program
that
is

u.s.
rep
ralph
abraham
and
businessman
eddie

aren't
pledging
to
rip
expansion
out
by
the
roots
in
a
state
where
about
of
residents
get
the
coverage
instead
edwards
opponents
strike
at
one
of
his
primary
selling
points
by
slamming
the
administration's
rollout
of
medicaid
expansion
rather
than
the
program's
creation
the
gop
contenders
accuse
edwards
health
department
of
millions
in
wasteful
spending
and
suggest
they
would
tighten
controls
they
have
to
be
careful
in
how
they
are
framing
their
critique
because
it's
a
popular
program
said
michael
henderson
director
of
louisiana
state
university's
public
policy
research
center
nearly
louisiana
adults
mainly
the
working
poor
and
many
of
them
voters
receive
the
government
financed
health
coverage
lsu's
annual
survey
of
louisiana
public
opinion
shows
approval
for
medicaid
expansion
including
backing
from
republicans
to
criticize
edwards
on
expansion
you
have
to
make
a
complicated
argument
that
says
hey
i
like
this
thing
the
governor
did
but
boy
i
wish
we'd
done
it
differently
let
me
do
it
differently
henderson
said
that's
a
tricky
argument
to
make
thirty-six
states
have
agreed
to
expand
their
medicaid
programs
under
the
federal
health
overhaul
few
in
the
south
louisiana's
program
started
in
july
adults
ages
to
with
incomes
up
to
of
the
federal
poverty
level
about
annually
for
a
single
adult
or
for
a
family
of
three
are
eligible
for
coverage
the
federal
government
pays
nearly
all
the
medicaid
expansion
cost
state
lawmakers
passed
a
tax
on
health
maintenance
organizations
and
hospital
fees
to
cover
the
state's
share
the
democratic
governor
said
thousands
of
people
have
been
newly
diagnosed
with
hypertension
diabetes
and
cancer
because
of
expansion
he
credits
the
billions
in
federal
tax
dollars
received
with
spurring
health
industry
job
growth
and
he
touts
census
data
showing
of
louisiana's
residents
are
without
health
insurance
lower
than
the
national
average
and
below
the
uninsured
rate
of
neighboring
non-expansion
states
expanding
medicaid
is
the
biggest
easiest
decision
that
i'm
going
to
make
as
governor
edwards
said
unlike
the
other
southern
states
across
the
country
louisiana
has
not
had
a
single
rural
hospital
to
close
and
that's
due
in
large
part
to
the
medicaid
expansion
edwards
campaign
ads
show
people
who
received
treatment
for
lupus
glaucoma
and
cancer
through
the
program
in
fundraising
emails
edwards
says
his
republican
opponents
won't
hesitate
to
dismantle
the
program
if
they
win
but
abraham
and
rispone
step
gingerly
when
asked
about
plans
for
the
expansion
program
insisting
they
don't
want
to
kick
anyone
off
the
coverage
if
they
qualify
abraham
a
doctor
and
third-term
congressman
from
northeast
louisiana
voted
repeatedly
to
repeal
the
entire
affordable
care
act
obamacare
a
complete
mess
absolutely
he
said
but
asked
if
that
assessment
applies
to
medicaid
expansion
abraham
replied
not
necessarily
abraham
and
rispone
said
edwards
mismanaged
expansion
with
rampant
fraud
and
abuse
they
cite
legislative
audits
that
documented
money
spent
on
ineligible
services
and
that
suggested
millions
could
have
been
spent
on
people
who
earned
too
much
for
the
coverage
including
people
with
six-figure
incomes
they
note
thousands
have
been
kicked
off
the
medicaid
rolls
after
the
edwards
administration
started
doing
quarterly
rather
than
annual
wage
checks
the
governor
made
the
decision
to
take
one
of
the
worst
versions
of
medicaid
expansion
available
rushed
it
to
market
knowing
full
well
that
they
did
not
have
the
tools
available
to
administer
or
ensure
that
the
people
that
were
enrolling
were
even
eligible
abraham
said
rispone
a
baton
rouge
businessman
largely
self-financing
his
campaign
said
he'd
freeze
enrollment
at
current
levels
until
he
could
assure
wasteful
spending
is
eliminated
though
critics
have
questioned
if
federal
law
allows
that
rispone
also
said
he'd
consider
trying
to
enact
work
requirements
for
the
expansion
program
i'm
going
in
there
and
making
sure
that
everybody
that's
on
it
should
be
on
it
and
they're
the
ones
that
have
the
most
need
