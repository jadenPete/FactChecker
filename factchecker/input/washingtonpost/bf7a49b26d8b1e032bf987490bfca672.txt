president
donald
trump
on
thursday
poured
cold
water
on
prospects
for
a
bipartisan
compromise
on
gun
legislation
even
as
attorney
general
william
barr
circulated
a
draft
plan
on
capitol
hill
to
expand
background
checks
for
gun
sales
in
a
fox
news
interview
trump
said
no
deal
is
imminent
more
than
six
weeks
after
mass
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
killed
more
than
people
we're
going
very
slowly
trump
said
adding
that
while
he
doesn't
want
bad
people
to
have
weapons
he
won't
allow
any
plan
to
move
forward
that
takes
guns
away
from
law-abiding
people
or
restricts
second
amendment
rights
a
proposal
being
floated
by
barr
would
require
background
checks
on
all
commercial
gun
sales
including
at
gun
shows
the
leaked
proposal
caused
an
uproar
on
capitol
hill
as
lawmakers
wondered
whether
trump
was
poised
to
support
expanded
background
checks
in
the
face
of
opposition
from
fellow
republicans
and
the
national
rifle
association
but
speaking
to
reporters
on
air
force
one
as
he
returned
home
from
california
late
wednesday
trump
said
the
plan
was
just
one
of
many
ideas
under
consideration
those
are
ideas
that
we're
talking
to
republicans
democrats
everybody
about
some
they
like
some
they
don't
like
just
a
series
of
concepts
trump
said
trump
told
fox
that
a
call
by
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
to
confiscate
assault-style
rifles
has
made
it
more
difficult
for
republicans
to
reach
agreement
on
gun
control
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
your
fellow
americans
anymore
o'rourke
a
former
texas
congressman
declared
during
a
democratic
presidential
debate
last
week
dummy
beto
made
it
much
harder
to
make
a
deal
trump
tweeted
wednesday
a
lot
of
people
think
this
is
just
a
way
of
taking
away
guns
trump
told
fox
adding
that
he
won't
let
that
happen
asked
about
the
proposal
to
expand
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
trump
distanced
himself
saying
the
document
was
put
out
by
barr
still
trump
said
barr
was
working
on
his
behalf
to
try
to
reach
a
deal
we
got
bill
barr
involved
he's
an
expert
on
guns
and
gun
control
trump
said
barr
and
eric
ueland
the
white
house
director
of
legislative
affairs
have
been
meeting
with
lawmakers
to
talk
about
ways
to
reduce
gun
violence
among
the
things
they
have
discussed
is
a
one-page
document
that
would
require
background
checks
on
all
advertised
commercial
gun
sales
the
plan
builds
on
a
proposal
by
sens
joe
manchin
d-w
va
and
pat
toomey
r-pa
to
expand
background
checks
barr
downplayed
the
proposal
wednesday
telling
reporters
we're
just
kicking
around
a
number
of
ideas
the
president
hasn't
made
any
decisions
i'm
just
kicking
around
ideas
and
perspectives
so
i'm
in
a
better
position
to
advise
him
asked
whether
he
would
recommend
the
background
check
plan
to
trump
barr
said
a
number
of
different
proposals
were
being
considered
even
so
the
nra
weighed
in
immediately
calling
the
proposal
a
non-starter
with
the
nra
and
its
million
members
the
plan
burdens
law-abiding
gun
owners
while
ignoring
what
actually
matters
fixing
the
broken
mental
health
system
and
the
prosecution
of
violent
criminals
said
jason
ouimet
the
nra's
legislative
director
manchin
who
met
with
barr
on
wednesday
along
with
toomey
and
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
said
he
remained
hopeful
referring
to
barr
manchin
said
i
think
we're
close
to
where
he
can
take
something
to
the
president
to
see
if
the
president
really
wants
to
do
something
on
gun
control
toomey
said
barr's
idea
is
a
mechanism
for
expanding
background
checks
beyond
what
we
have
today
i
have
republican
colleagues
who
are
open
to
that
so
i'm
modestly
encouraged
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
earlier
this
week
that
congress
remains
in
a
holding
pattern
on
gun
control
as
lawmakers
await
proposals
from
the
white
house
trump
has
previously
pledged
to
veto
a
house-passed
bill
to
expand
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
but
mcconnell
said
he
is
hopeful
there
are
other
gun-related
proposals
that
congress
can
approve
and
trump
can
support
trump
and
white
house
aides
have
discussed
a
number
of
gun
control
measures
with
lawmakers
including
steps
to
go
after
fraudulent
buyers
notify
state
and
local
law
enforcement
when
a
potential
buyer
fails
a
background
check
issue
state-level
emergency
risk
protection
orders
boost
mental
health
assistance
and
speed
up
executions
for
those
convicted
of
mass
shootings
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
and
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
have
warned
trump
that
gun-control
legislation
must
include
the
house-passed
bill
to
expand
background
checks
any
proposal
that
does
not
include
the
house
legislation
will
not
get
the
job
done
because
dangerous
loopholes
will
be
left
open
