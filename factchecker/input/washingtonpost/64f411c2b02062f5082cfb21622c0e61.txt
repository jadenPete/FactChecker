democratic

candidate
beto
o'rourke
says
he's
open
to
broadening
his
proposal
to
require
owners
of
ak-
s
and
ar-
s
to
sell
them
to
the
government
during
an
emotional
town
hall
thursday
near
the
site
of
the
colorado
theater
shooting
a
man
who
identified
himself
as
a
survivor
of
the
columbine
massacre
noted
that
the
shooters
there
didn't
use
the
military-style
weapons
o'rourke
wants
to
take
they
instead
used
regular
semi-automatic
weapons
he
challenged
o'rourke
to
confiscate
those
arms
as
well
o'rourke
told
reporters
afterward
if
there's
a
way
to
improve
what
we
proposed
i
want
to
make
sure
we're
reflecting
that
most
pistols
and
many
rifles
in
the
u.s.
are
semi-automatic
in
contrast
there
are
about
million
ak-
s
and
ar-
s
out
of
more
than
million
firearms
in
private
hands
