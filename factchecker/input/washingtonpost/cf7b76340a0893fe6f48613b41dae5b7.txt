comments
last

president
trump
stops
to
talk
to
members
of
the
media
as
he
walks

the
washington
post
president
trump
said
wednesday
it
has
become
much
harder
to
reach
a
deal
with
democrats
on
gun
legislation
blaming
an
emphatic
call
by
former
congressman
beto
o'rourke
tex
for
a
mandatory
buyback
program
for
assault-style
weapons
o'rourke
created
one
of
the
most
memorable
moments
of
last
week's
democratic
presidential
debate
in
houston
when
he
spoke
passionately
about
a
need
for
gun
control
in
the
wake
of
recent
mass
shootings
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
he
said
referring
to
his
support
for
mandatory
buybacks
of
war
weapons
dummy
beto
made
it
much
harder
to
make
a
deal
convinced
many
that
dems
just
want
to
take
your
guns
away
trump
said
on
twitter
adding
will
continue
forward
his
tweet
comes
as
congress
waits
for
trump
to
announce
what
gun-related
proposals
he
would
support
following
a
spate
of
mass
shootings
including
back-to-back
massacres
last
month
in
el
paso
and
dayton
ohio
republicans
seize
on
o'rourke's
emphatic
call
for
mandatory
buyback
of
assault
weapons
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
said
tuesday
that
congress
remains
in
a
holding
pattern
while
awaiting
guidance
from
the
white
house
i'm
still
waiting
for
guidance
from
the
white
house
about
what
trump
is
comfortable
signing
and
hopefully
making
some
progress
mcconnell
said
following
last
week's
debate
o'rourke
said
that
his
buyback
plan
would
be
not
voluntary
republicans
seized
on
o'rourke's
comments
using
them
to
broadly
paint
democrats
as
overly
eager
to
confiscate
firearms
while
some
democrats
suggested
the
remarks
were
not
helpful
in
persuading
republicans
to
embrace
more
modest
changes
such
as
expanding
background
checks
for
gun
purchasers
o'rourke
responded
to
trump
on
twitter
later
wednesday
morning
accusing
the
president
of
cowardice
to
be
clear
we
will
buy
back
every
single
assault
weapon
he
wrote
we'll
also
license
every
gun
do
a
background
check
on
every
buyer
that's
what
the
american
people
want
and
deserve
the
only
thing
stopping
us
from
ending
this
epidemic
is
you
your
cowardice
do
the
right
thing
o'rourke
also
reacted
on
twitter
to
a
report
that
senate
minority
leader
charles
e.
schumer
d-n
y.
had
said
other
democrats
do
not
agree
with
o'rourke
on
a
mandatory
buyback
program
the
party
is
with
us
the
country
is
with
us
o'rourke
tweeted
now
it's
time
for
democrats
to
lead
o'rourke's
critics
have
included
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
a
democratic
presidential
rival
asked
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
on
sunday
whether
o'rourke's
blunt
comment
was
playing
into
the
hands
of
republicans
buttigieg
said
yes
when
even
this
president
and
even
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hands
buttigieg
said
let's
make
the
most
of
it
and
get
these
things
done
o'rourke
responded
on
twitter
saying
what
mcconnell
and
trump
might
be
interested
in
is
not
enough
neither
is
poll-testing
your
message
o'rourke
wrote
gun
violence
is
a
life-or-death
issue
and
we
have
to
represent
the
bold
ideas
of
people
all
over
the
country
trump's
tweet
on
wednesday
appears
to
have
been
inspired
by
criticism
of
o'rourke
on
monday
by
fox
news
host
jesse
watters
trump
included
a
reference
to
a
fox
news
program
on
which
watters
said
the
democrats
have
always
wanted
to
take
your
guns
beto
is
the
one
stupid
enough
to
say
it
during
a
television
appearance
on
wednesday
morning
rep
tim
ryan
ohio
another
democratic
presidential
candidate
said
o'rourke's
views
shouldn't
affect
the
outcome
of
a
congressional
debate
over
gun
legislation
beto's
not
in
congress
so
his
opinion
shouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it

said

cnn
