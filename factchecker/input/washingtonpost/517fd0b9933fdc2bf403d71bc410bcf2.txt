evan

ap
president
trump
appeared
to
distance
himself
from
embattled
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
on
wednesday
declining
to
offer
either
encouragement
or
praise
to
his
most
enthusiastically
loyal
foreign
ally
now
that
he
faces
potential
electoral
defeat
speaking
a
day
after
israeli
elections
that
at
best
leave
netanyahu
weakened
trump
seemed
cool
to
the
israeli
conservative
who
has
touted
his
ideological
lockstep
with
trump
as
a
chief
reelection
credential
trump
said
he
had
not
spoken
to
netanyahu
a
man
he
has
described
as
a
close
friend
he
then
noted
that
the
election
is
close
while
playing
down
netanyahu's
importance
to
the
alliance
between
the
united
states
and
israel
our
relations
are
with
israel
so
we'll
see
what
happens
trump
told
reporters
traveling
with
him
in
california
netanyahu
failed
to
win
a
clear
majority
in
national
elections
tuesday
that
the
long-serving
conservative
leader
had
hoped
would
give
him
a
strong
mandate
for
another
term
and
armor
against
a
looming
corruption
case
during
his
presidency
trump
has
tightly
embraced
netanyahu
and
his
hawkish
views
on
the
israeli-palestinian
conflict
frequently
winning
praise
from
the
prime
minister
for
such
things
as
moving
the
u.s.
embassy
to
jerusalem
and
announcing
that
the
united
states
would
recognize
israeli
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights
but
his
comments
wednesday
underscored
trump's
penchant
for
separating
himself
from
political
allies
once
they
become
weakened
or
could
serve
as
a
liability
to
him
ice
cold
brookings
institution
middle
east
specialist
tamara
cofman
wittes
observed
on
twitter
now
trump
will
have
to
decide
how
to
deal
with
a
weakened
netanyahu
or
a
new
prime
minister
whose
views
may
be
more
dovish
than
trump's
on
the
middle
east
the
calculation
for
trump
who
has
said
that
american
jews
who
vote
for
democrats
are
being
disloyal
to
israel
will
be
as
much
about
domestic
politics
ahead
of
the
election
as
it
is
about
foreign
policy
the
president's
hard-line
approach
has
served
not
only
as
an
attempt
to
win
over
some
jewish
voters
who
have
previously
supported
democrats
but
to
appeal
to
evangelicals
who
are
among
his
staunchest
supporters
and
revere
israel
for
its
role
in
the
biblical
story
netanyahu
may
be
able
to
survive
if
he
can
cobble
together
a
coalition
or
power-sharing
government
and
numerous
analysts
suggest
he
has
a
better
chance
to
do
so
than
his
chief
challenger
former
army
officer
benny
gantz
any
such
arrangement
would
leave
netanyahu
with
less
autonomy
trump's
comments
wednesday
showed
that
he
smelled
weakness
and
wanted
to
give
himself
some
insulation
from
netanyahu
said
dan
shapiro
a
former
u.s.
ambassador
to
israel
trump
shapiro
said
wants
little
to
do
with
a
loser
last
week
trump
declined
to
publicly
endorse
netanyahu's
pledge
to
annex
parts
of
the
west
bank
if
he
were
reelected
that
stood
in
contrast
to
the
warm
words
surrounding
netanyahu's
election
bid
five
months
ago
when
trump
announced
the
united
states's
new
policy
stance
on
the
golan
heights
and
seemed
happy
to
have
netanyahu
make
a
show
of
their
close
relationship
in
a
small
gesture
trump
did
announce
last
weekend
that
he
and
netanyahu
would
explore
a
mutual
defense
treaty
such
a
pact
would
change
little
about
the
two
nations
military
relationship
and
trump
said
only
that
the
idea
was
under
review
aaron
david
miller
a
former
u.s.
adviser
on
israeli
and
palestinian
issues
said
trump
began
to
sour
on
netanyahu
because
of
his
struggles
in
israel's
april
election
for
trump
keeping
up
his
pro-israel
credentials
and
pleasing
conservative
jewish
and
evangelical
voters
is
more
important
than
the
bond
he
forged
with
netanyahu
miller
said
trump
only
cares
about
one
election
and
it's
not
benjamin
netanyahu's
miller
said
trump
had
bet
on
netanyahu
as
a
canny
politician
and
fellow
tough
guy
remarking
to
friends
that
netanyahu
was
a
survivor
who
beat
the
odds
people
who
have
spoken
with
trump
about
israeli
politics
said
discussing
the
private
conversations
under
the
condition
of
anonymity
but
trump
never
saw
netanyahu
as
the
only
key
to
his
own
political
fortunes
with
jewish
voters
or
conservatives
for
whom
iran's
ability
to
threaten
israel
is
a
primary
concern
these
people
said
rather
trump
saw
netanyahu
as
a
partner
in
building
a
consensus
against
the
legacy
of
former
president
barack
obama
who
had
a
troubled
relationship
with
netanyahu
and
broke
with
him
over
pursuit
of
an
international
agreement
limiting
iran's
nuclear
ambitions
both
netanyahu
and
trump
argue
that
the
deal
was
full
of
holes
the
two
bonded
over
trump's
adoption
of
netanyahu-like
rhetoric
about
the
nuclear
deal
which
was
inked
just
as
trump's
outsider
candidacy
was
taking
off
trump
has
run
down
a
checklist
of
pro-israel
actions
as
president
most
coordinated
with
netanyahu
he
inveighed
against
the
nuclear
deal
and
walked
out
of
it
last
year
he
upended
decades
of
u.s.
policy
by
recognizing
jerusalem
as
the
israeli
capital
he
inaugurated
an
effort
to
broker
peace
between
israel
and
the
palestinians
that
did
not
set
a
sovereign
palestine
as
the
end
goal
and
he
installed
an
ambassador
who
had
rhetorically
and
financially
supported
west
bank
settlements
netanyahu
tried
to
leverage
all
of
that
with
trump's
blessing
but
that
did
not
mean
trump
viewed
the
entire
relationship
with
israel
as
hinged
to
netanyahu
a
senior
administration
official
said
the
president
is
right
to
say
that
the
u.s.
relationship
is
with
israel
not
its
leader
the
official
said
our
relationship
is
bigger
than
individuals
we
had
the
worst
possible
relationship
between
obama
and
netanyahu
and
that
did
not
mean
the
relationship
itself
was
at
risk
said
the
official
who
like
others
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
matter
on
the
record
trump
has
chafed
at
netanyahu's
opposition
to
potential
new
diplomacy
with
iran
a
project
trump
sees
as
a
chance
to
build
his
legacy
as
a
peacemaker
current
and
former
administration
officials
said
shared
opposition
to
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
helped
cement
trump's
close
relationship
with
netanyahu
but
trump's
objection
to
the
agreement
was
tied
to
his
belief
that
he
could
get
a
better
bargain
netanyahu
opposes
anything
that
iran
could
spin
as
a
concession
including
overtures
from
the
american
president
trump
loyalists
were
annoyed
by
netanyahu's
hasty
trip
earlier
this
month
to
london
where
he
met
with
prime
minister
boris
johnson
in
what
was
widely
seen
as
an
attempt
to
pressure
trump
away
from
direct
engagement
with
iran
trump
rankled
some
american
jews
with
his
remark
last
month
that
if
you
vote
for
a
democrat
you're
very
very
disloyal
to
israel
and
to
the
jewish
people
the
remark
and
its
echoes
of
anti-semitic
rhetoric
about
dual
loyalty
are
unlikely
to
depress
votes
among
jewish
republicans
however
trump
advisers
said
netanyahu's
office
announced
wednesday
that
in
light
of
the
political
disarray
he
would
not
attend
the
annual
united
nations
general
assembly
next
week
an
appearance
he
has
regularly
used
to
make
the
case
for
international
unity
against
what
he
calls
an
existential
threat
from
iran
given
that
bibi
didn't
do
so
well
during
the
elections
he
knows
there
is
no
way
he
could
go
and
give
a
big
speech
at
the
u.n.
an
israeli
security
official
said
he
wouldn't
have
the
legitimacy
to
do
so
at
the
moment
but
netanyahu's
decision
also
forecloses
a
meeting
with
trump
which
both
nations
had
said
was
likely
if
netanyahu
attended
that
may
be
a
relief
to
trump
who
is
already
looking
beyond
netanyahu
to
what
a
future
israeli
government
might
mean
for
his
hopes
to
launch
an
arab-israeli
peace
plan
this
year
two
people
familiar
with
the
plan
said
a
coalition
government
that
clips
netanyahu's
wings
might
improve
chances
for
that
plan
which
will
ask
concessions
of
israel
one
former
senior
administration
official
said
a
israeli
official
summed
it
up
this
way
yes
he
is
friends
with
bibi
but
he
also
likes
winners
and
he
does
want
to
move
his
peace
plan
forward
no
matter
who
the
prime
minister
is
steve
hendrix
in
jerusalem
and
souad
mekhennet
in
washington
