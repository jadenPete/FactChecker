washington
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
has
agreed
to
testify
next
week
to
the
house
intelligence
committee
after
balking
at
the
panel's
demand
to
turn
over
a
secret
whistleblower
complaint
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
subpoenaed
joseph
maguire
last
week
saying
he
was
withholding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
and
questioning
whether
he
had
been
directed
to
do
so
by
the
white
house
or
the
attorney
general
schiff
did
not
divulge
the
subject
of
the
complaint
but
said
the
committee
has
been
told
that
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
determined
it
to
be
credible
and
a
matter
of
urgent
concern
maguire
will
testify
publicly
about
the
whistleblower
complaint
on
sept
and
the
committee
will
also
hear
from
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
on
thursday
in
a
closed-door
hearing
schiff
announced
the
committee
places
the
highest
importance
on
the
protection
of
whistleblowers
and
their
complaints
to
congress
schiff
said
in
a
letter
tuesday
the
general
counsel
for
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
jason
klitenic
wrote
that
the
agency
is
protecting
the
whistleblower
and
argued
the
allegation
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
urgent
concern
he
said
the
complaint
concerned
conduct
from
someone
outside
the
intelligence
community
and
did
not
relate
to
intelligence
activity
under
the
dni's
supervision
schiff
said
last
week
that
maguire
is
required
to
share
the
complaint
with
congress
and
said
the
attempt
to
hold
it
back
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct
he
added
that
he
was
concerned
that
administration
officials
are
engaged
in
an
unlawful
effort
to
protect
president
