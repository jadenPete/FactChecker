sounds
like
sanders
but
looks
like
biden

pete
buttigieg
speaks
at
a
campaign
event
in
new
hampshire
cheryl
senter
for
the
washington
post
pete
buttigieg
is
billing
his
new
health-care
proposal
as
a
riff
off
sen
bernie
sanders's
medicare-for-all
plan
it's
called
medicare-for-all-who-want-it
but
if
you
read
the
proposal
out
this
morning
it's
actually
a
lot
more
about
building
on
the
affordable
care
act
the
approach
preferred
by
the
race's
moderates
the
south
bend
ind
mayor
who
came
in
third
in
a
new
iowa
primary
poll
is
a
prime
example
of
how
most
of
the
democratic
presidential
contenders
have
distanced
themselves
from
the
dramatic
overhaul
envisioned
by
sanders
sanders's
plan
would
upend
the
country's
system
of
employer-sponsored
coverage
by
putting
everyone
on
a
cushy
but
expensive
government-backed
plan
everyone
else
except
perhaps
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
has
left
open
the
door
for
some
private
coverage
to
remain
even
those
who
originally
sponsored
sanders's
medicare-for-all
we're
looking
at
you
sen
kamala
harris
yet
while
buttigieg
said
he
favored
medicare-for-all
early
in
his
campaign
a
set
of
proposals
his
campaign
released
this
morning
looks
more
like
a
public
option
approach
than
anything
else
in
fact
when
it
comes
to
expanding
coverage
to
the
uninsured
and
making
it
more
affordable
for
people
the
buttigieg
plan
is
comparable
to
the
public
option
plan
from
the
race's
top
moderate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
biden
on
a
visit
with
students
on
the
campus
of
texas
southern
university
ap
photo
eric
gay
buttigieg
even
struck
a
similar
tone
to
biden
in
a
post
op-ed
this
morning
arguing
that
people
should
be
able
to
choose
their
own
coverage
because
health
care
is
a
personal
issue
biden
often
frames
his
health
care
beliefs
in
the
context
of
losing
his
son
to
brain
cancer
buttigieg
describes
how
he
lost
his
father
to
cancer
earlier
this
year
but
fortunately
didn't
have
to
worry
about
massive
medical
bills
like
many
americans
do
because
he
was
covered
by
medicare
we
were
free
to
focus
on
what
mattered
most
buttigieg
wrote
i
want
every
family
to
have
that
same
freedom
but
as
anyone
who
has
ever
visited
a
doctor
knows
health
care
in
the
united
states
remains
too
expensive
too
complicated
and
too
frustrating
the
system
seems
almost
designed
to
leave
us
feeling
powerless
and
confused
as
president
i
will
put
americans
in
charge
of
their
own
health
care
with
affordable
choices
for
all
here
are
ways
the
buttigieg
plan
and
the
biden
plan
would
both
expand
insurance
coverage
to
the
roughly
million
currently
uninsured
americans
and
improve
affordability
for
others
buttigieg
has
been
clear
that
he
thinks
more
needs
to
be
done
than
just
expanding
the
aca
but
he
thinks
bumping
people
from
the
plans
they
have
now
isn't
the
way
to
do
it
he
envisions
a
more
organic
type
of
transition
to
more
people
on
public
insurance
by
allowing
them
to
choose
between
it
or
private
options
buttigieg's
views
on
a
range
of
topics
puts
him
among
the
race's
more
liberal
candidates
he
has
defended
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez's
proposal
for
a
percent
effective
marginal
tax
rate
he
wants
to
abolish
the
electoral
college
but
his
stated
approach
to
health
care
puts
him
closer
to
the
biden
pragmatist
camp
than
the
sanders
idealist
camp
buttigieg's
comments
at
last
week's
presidential
primary
debate
if
you
watched
the
last
democratic
primary
debate
buttigieg
gave
some
hints
that
he
was
ready
to
go
down
the
public
option
pathway
rather
than
the
medicare-for-all
pathway
he
told
sanders
the
problem
with
the
damn
bill
is
that
it
doesn't
trust
the
american
people
i
trust
you
to
choose
what
makes
the
most
sense
for
you
buttigieg
told
the
audience
at
the
abc
news
debate
last
week
not
my
way
or
the
highway
buttigieg's
proposal
released
today
also
suggests
some
ways
to
end
surprise
medical
billing
expand
treatment
for
mental
health
care
and
make
medicare
more
affordable
for
seniors
it
says
the
campaign
will
release
more
ideas
for
lowering
drug
costs
and
ensuring
equity
in
health-care
access
of
course
even
the
most
detailed
of
proposals
coming
from
the
campaigns
hardly
provide
the
level
of
specificity
that
congress
would
need
to
pass
another
major
health-care
reform
it's
best
to
think
of
these
proposals
as
signals
of
how
the
candidate
is
thinking
about
the
issue
and
what
worries
them
