a
key
senate
panel
on
thursday
approved
million
to
help
states
beef
up
their
election
systems
freeing
up
the
money
after
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
came
under
criticism
from
democrats
for
impeding
separate
election
security
legislation
the
kentucky
republican
announced
in
a
floor
speech
in
advance
of
the
appropriations
committee
vote
that
he
would
support
the
funding
claiming
the
trump
administration
has
made
enormous
strides
in
protecting
the
nation's
voting
infrastructure
the
committee
approved
the
money
on
a
bipartisan
voice
vote
the
panel's
top
democrat
patrick
leahy
said
funding
election
security
grants
is
a
matter
of
national
security
democrat
chris
coons
said
the
funding
would
help
states
invest
in
updated
voting
systems
and
combat
cyberattacks
from
foreign
actors
such
as
russia
whose
widespread
efforts
on
behalf
of
president
donald
trump's
campaign
were
documented
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
we
are
simply
responding
to
what
i
know
to
be
an
unmet
need
coons
said
in
we
all
know
the
russian
government's
military
intelligence
branch
directed
extensive
activity
against
our
election
infrastructure
and
i
think
there
is
important
undone
work
in
providing
modest
federal
support
that
will
make
some
progress
in
assuring
that
our
election
infrastructure
is
protected
an
earlier
version
of
a
spending
bill
that
funds
the
federal
election
assistance
commission
did
not
include
the
money
but
leahy
appeared
to
have
gop
allies
on
the
powerful
appropriations
panel
and
the
committee's
top
republican
opted
for
bipartisan
negotiations
funding
election
security
grants
is
a
matter
of
national
security
preserving
our
democracy
and
maintaining
full
faith
in
our
elections
leahy
said
calling
the
grants
a
vital
issue
this
committee
has
not
funded
since
fiscal
year
despite
a
persistent
and
confirmed
threat
of
interference
in
our
elections
by
foreign
adversaries
the
house
has
passed
significantly
broader
election
security
legislation
but
mcconnell
opposes
the
measure
and
has
discouraged
the
senate
rules
committee
from
acting
on
a
companion
bill
the
trump
administration
has
made
enormous
strides
to
help
states
secure
their
elections
without
giving
washington
new
power
to
push
the
states
around
mcconnell
said
sen
ron
wyden
d-ore
who
has
been
outspoken
about
the
need
for
improved
election
security
called
the
proposal
a
joke
and
an
effort
by
mcconnell
to
desperately
get
the
issue
to
go
away
this
amendment
doesn't
even
require
the
funding
be
spent
on
election
security
it
can
go
for
anything
related
to
elections
wyden
said
in
a
statement
giving
states
taxpayer
money
to
buy
hackable
paperless
machines
or
systems
with
poor
cybersecurity
is
a
waste
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y
was
more
measured
maybe
just
maybe
republicans
are
starting
to
come
around
to
our
view
election
security
is
necessary
that
if
americans
don't
believe
their
elections
are
on
the
up
and
up
woe
is
us
as
a
country
as
a
democracy
schumer
said
it's
not
all
the
money
we
have
requested
and
doesn't
include
a
single
solitary
reform
that
virtually
everyone
knows
we
need
but
it's
a
start
but
sen
james
lankford
r-okla
said
there
is
about
million
in
unspent
funds
from
a
million
appropriation
for
the
budget
year
he
said
oversight
is
needed
given
the
loose
strings
on
the
grants
to
states
critics
of
mcconnell
such
as
msnbc
host
joe
scarborough
have
taken
to
calling
him
moscow
mitch
over
his
refusal
to
bring
the
separate
election
security
measure
up
for
a
senate
vote
democrats
say
mcconnell
is
shunning
the
stand-alone
election
security
legislation
because
it
could
be
seen
as
a
slap
at
trump
who
has
discounted
russian
interference
in
the
election
