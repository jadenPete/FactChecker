making
a
political
donation
to
a
presidential
campaign
is
about
to
get
as
easy
as
well
saying
it
out
loud
starting
next
month
users
of
voice-controlled
home
assistant
amazon
alexa
will
be
able
to
dictate
their

least
and
up
to
to
campaigns
and
the
feature
is
currently
limited
to
presidential
campaigns
campaigns
can
sign
up
starting
thursday
the
latest
evolution
in
campaign
technology
raises
new
questions
about
how
such
contributions
will
be
screened
to
make
sure
they
are
legal
and
it
points
to
challenges
federal
regulators
face
in
keeping
up
with
such
innovations
without
a
functioning
federal
election
commission
which
lost
its
voting
quorum
last
month
alexa
political
contributions
is
among
the
new
features
amazon
announced
wednesday
to
help
users
find
more
information
about
the
presidential
election
including
how
candidates
are
polling
candidate
endorsements
and
the
dates
of
primary
contests
amazon
chief

donations
will
be
made
through
amazon
pay
which
uses
the
credit
card
or
bank
account
saved
with
a
user's
amazon
account
the
alexa
user
also
needs
to
allow
voice
purchasing
amazon
will
charge
campaigns
a
processing
fee
of
percent
plus
cents
per
donation
amazon
spokeswoman
kerry
hall
said
there
are
a
number
of
questions
about
exactly
how
the
system
would
work
and
any
potential
legal
concerns
that
may
arise
for
example
what
if
a
family
member
makes
a
donation
using
a
shared
amazon
account
tied
to
another
person's
credit
card
or
a
house
guest
who
is
not
legally
allowed
to
make
political
donations
under
u.s.
law
amazon's
q
a
page
clarifies
that
there
are
restrictions
on
who
can
make
political
contributions
hall
said
alexa
will
verbally
list
requirements
to
donate
to
political
campaigns
and
will
ask
the
customer
to
confirm
they
are
eligible
to
donate
to
prevent
unintended
donations
users
can
set
up
a
verification
code
that
they
recite
to
alexa
before
the
donation
is
processed
amazon
says
but
setting
it
up
is
optional
certainly
as
people
expect
voice
assistant
devices
to
do
tasks
for
them
i
could
see
why
this
is
attractive
said
richard
hasen
an
elections
law
expert
at
the
university
of
california
at
irvine
but
i
do
think
it
raises
a
number
of
legal
concerns
that
will
have
to
be
fully
fleshed
out
to
develop
such
a
system
it's
unclear
how
many
campaigns
would
participate
at
least
one
presidential
campaign
that
of
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
said
wednesday
that
it
is
in
talks
with
amazon
the
campaign
didn't
say
whether
it
has
concerns
about
the
risk
that
donors
could
mispronounce
the
candidate's
last
name
the
company
will
not
report
directly
to
the
fec
or
make
donor
information
public
hall
said
instead
it
will
provide
to
campaigns
the
donors
name
email
address
and
physical
address
hall
said
federal
regulations
allow
commercial
vendors
to
process
donations
for
campaigns
as
long
as
they
meet
certain
requirements
those
include
processing
the
donations
through
accounts
separate
from
the
corporation
and
making
sure
there
are
adequate
screening
procedures
to
make
sure
that
the
contributions
are
being
made
legally
said
campaign
finance
lawyer
dan
petalas
formerly
the
fec's
acting
general
counsel
and
head
of
enforcement
still
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
a
company
like
amazon
to
seek
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
fec
petalas
said
such
opinions
provide
assurances
to
campaigns
donors
and
firms
that
a
creative
business
proposal
meets
regulations
and
help
ward
off
baseless
complaints
to
the
fec
he
said
yet
the
agency
is
unable
to
release
official
guidance
or
conduct
official
business
after
it
lost
its
voting
quorum
with
the
resignation
of
vice
chairman
matthew
petersen
president
trump
has
not
yet
announced
a
plan
to
nominate
new
commissioners
no
doubt
the
rapidly
evolving
technological
context
in
which
people
conduct
their
affairs
is
a
challenge
for
regulatory
agencies
to
keep
pace
with
but
in
this
instance
i
think
the
fec
would
be
well
suited
to
address
any
questions
and
likely
would
approve
the
proposal
petalas
said
but
unfortunately
it
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
until
the
white
house
acts
to
restore
the
agency's
quorum
