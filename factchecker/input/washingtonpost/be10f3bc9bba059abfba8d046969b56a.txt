ap
president
trump
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
the
manhattan
district
attorney
thursday
his
attorney
said
seeking
to
stop
him
from
subpoenaing
trump's
tax
returns
in
a
probe
of
hush-money
payments
during
the
election
in
the
suit
trump
argues
that
district
attorney
cyrus
vance
is
conducting
a
criminal
investigation
of
him
which
he
contends
is
not
allowed
under
the
constitution
that's
because
the
constitution
prohibits
any
prosecutor
from
investigating
any
sitting
president
for
any
criminal
wrongdoing
he
says
if
that
were
permitted
trump
says
it
could
give
local
authorities
too
much
power
to
hamstring
a
president's
actions
all
you
need
is
one
prosecutor
one
trial
judge
the
barest
amount
of
probable
cause
and
a
supportive
local
constituency
and
you
can
shut
down
a
presidency
trump's
complaint
says
quoting
law
professor
jed
shugerman
according
to
a
copy
of
the
lawsuit
posted
online
by
cnn
instead
trump
argued
the
power
to
investigate
presidents
is
invested
in
congress
which
has
the
power
to
impeach
and
remove
presidents
for
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
his
suit
also
quoted
an
article
by
supreme
court
justice
brett
m.
kavanaugh
written
in
when
kavanaugh
was
an
appeals
court
judge
saying
that
a
president
who
is
concerned
about
an
ongoing
criminal
investigation
is
almost
inevitably
going
to
do
a
worse
job
as
president
on
thursday
u.s.
district
judge
victor
marrero
ordered
a
hearing
on
the
lawsuit
for
sept
vance
agreed
to
delay
enforcement
of
the
subpoena
until
after
that
hearing
the
suit
is
the
latest
in
a
string
of
similar
lawsuits
by
trump
seeking
to
block
investigations
of
his
finances
by
prosecutors
and
new
york
authorities
in
this
case

trump's
longtime
accounting
firm
trump's
attorneys
said
he
asked
for
eight
years
worth
of
tax
returns
for
trump
and
his
businesses
plus
a
number
of
other
financial
documents
according
to
trump's
complaint
the
investigation
appears
to
focus
on
payments
to
two
women
stormy
daniels
and
karen
mcdougal
who
say
they
had
affairs
with
trump
years
ago
daniels
an
adult-film
actress
was
paid
by
then-trump
attorney
michael
cohen
for
her
silence
before
the
election
cohen
said
that
the
payments
were
made
at
trump's
direction
and
that
trump's
company
reimbursed
him
cohen
is
now
serving
a
three-year
prison
sentence
after
pleading
guilty
to
campaign
finance
violations
related
to
the
hush-money
payments
as
well
as
other
offenses
mcdougal
was
paid
by
american
media
inc
the
publisher
of
the
national
enquirer
the
company
acknowledged
that
payment
last
year
and
agreed
to
cooperate
with
prosecutors
trump
has
said
he
did
not
have
affairs
with
daniels
or
mcdougal
trump
his
aides
and
his
attorneys
have
made
contradictory
statements
about
the
president's
knowledge
of
the
payments
still
his
attorneys
have
repeatedly
denied
that
trump
committed
wrongdoing
no
campaign
violations
were
engaged
in
by
the
president
jay
sekulow
trump's
personal
attorney
said
this
month
in
the
lawsuit
filed
thursday
trump
said
that
vance
did
not
need
eight
years
of
his
tax
returns
to
examine
whether
any
laws
were
broken
by
the
payments
in
the
lawsuit
trump
calls
vance's
subpoena
to
mazars
a
bad
faith
effort
to
harass
the
president
by
obtaining
and
exposing
his
private
financial
information
not
a
legitimate
attempt
to
enforce
new
york
law
sekulow
said
in
a
brief
statement
thursday
that
we
have
filed
a
lawsuit
this
morning
in
federal
court
on
behalf
of
the
president
in
order
to
address
the
significant
constitutional
issues
at
stake
in
this
case
danny
frost
a
spokesman
for
vance
said
only
that
we
have
received
the
plaintiff's
complaint
and
will
respond
as
appropriate
in
court
in
april
trump
filed
a
similar
lawsuit
against
mazars
seeking
to
stop
it
from
complying
with
a
subpoena
from
the
house
oversight
committee
in
july
trump
sued
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
new
york
state
to
block
the
state
from
using
a
newly
passed
law
to
share
trump's
state
tax
returns
with
congress
both
cases
are
pending
also
thursday
a
federal
judge
in
sacramento
issued
a
temporary
injunction
against
a
law
that
would
bar
presidential
candidates
from
appearing
on
california's
primary
ballot
if
they
decline
to
release
their
tax
returns
soon
after
the
measure
was
signed
into
law
by
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
in
july
trump
and
the
republican
national
committee
filed
lawsuits
challenging
it
arguing
that
california
was
attempting
to
circumvent
the
u.s.
constitution
sekulow
said
in
a
statement
that
the
president's
legal
team
was
encouraged
by
u.s.
district
judge
morrison
england
jr
s
decision
and
looked
forward
to
the
formal
ruling
it
remains
our
position
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
states
are
not
permitted
to
add
additional
requirements
for
candidates
for
president
and
that
the
law
violates
the
constitution
