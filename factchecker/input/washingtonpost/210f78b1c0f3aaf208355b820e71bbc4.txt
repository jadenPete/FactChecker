patrick

federal
reserve
chair
jerome
h.
powell
just
left
everyone
guessing
about
what
the
central
bank
will
do
next
and
that's
exactly
what
investors
wanted
the
fed
met
expectations
by
trimming
its
benchmark
interest
rate
by
a
quarter-point
for
the
second
time
in
a
row
then
the
fed
chief
parried
questions
from
reporters
seeking
clues
about
whether
more
cuts
are
on
the
way
he
made
equivocal
remarks
that
effectively
painted
a
rorschach
inkblot
onto
which
investors
and
other
market
watchers
could
project
what
they
hoped
to
see
powell
held
his
cards
close
to
his
chest
and
would
not
commit
to
additional
shifts
in
policy
grant

chief
economist
diane
swonk
wrote
powell
dodged
all
questions
regarding
the
course
of
rates
going
forward
and
where
he
sits
on
the
spectrum
of
views
on
display
within
the
federal
open
market
committee
he
underscored
that
the
bulk
of
the
committee
is
now
moving
on
a
meeting-by-meeting
basis
headlines
out
of
his
latest
news
conference
reflected
the
uncertainty
presenting
a
range
of
takeaways
seemingly
at
odds
with
each
other
the
result
was
a
too-rare
phenomenon
for
the
embattled
powell
stocks
rallied
after
he
spoke
they
dipped
first
on
snap
judgments
that
powell
was
signaling
no
further
rate
cuts
this
year
but
turned
around
as
his
ambiguity
sank
in
and
closed
in
the
green
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
gained
points
or
percent
on
the
day
the
dow
has
closed
in
positive
territory
on
just
two
of
the
other
days
when
powell
has
held
a
press
conference
the
index
shed
percent
on
the
day
of
his
last
appearance
for
example
after
the
fed
cut
rates
for
the
first
time
since
the
financial
crisis
powell
trampled
on
that
news
in
his
back-and-forth
with
reporters
by
sending
what
investors
interpreted
as
hawkish
signals
about
where
the
central
bank
was
headed
powell's
approach
was
dictated
in
part
by
necessity
he
presides
over
a
federal
open
market
committee
as
divided
as
any
in
years
the
split
was
evident
again
in
the
vote
as
three
regional
fed
presidents
dissented
a
first
in
powell's
tenure
two
boston
fed
president
eric
rosengren
and
kansas
city
fed
president
esther
george
wanted
to
leave
rates
untouched
the
third
st
louis
fed
president
james
bullard
wanted
a
deeper
cut
most
fed
officials
favor
staying
the
course
from
here
specifically
five
of
the
participants
in
the
meeting
objected
to
the
fed's
two
rate
cuts
this
year
five
want
no
further
rate
cuts
and
seven
want
to
cut
rates
further
from
the
new
york
times's
neil
irwin
powell
for
his
part
dismissed
the
notion
the
widening
dissent
poses
a
problem
this
is
a
time
of
difficult
judgments
and
as
you
can
see
disparate
perspectives
and
i
really
do
think
that's
nothing
but
healthy
he
said
and
so
i
see
a
benefit
in
having
those
diverse
perspectives
really
but
powell's
two-step
in
his
news
conference
also
speaks
to
the
squeeze
facing
the
central
bank
fed
officials
are
trying
to
help
keep
the
economy
growing
without
fanning
inflation
or
squelching
growth
my
colleague
heather
long
writes
the
economy
is
sending
mixed
signals
about
whether
it
might
slow
markedly
next
year
or
continue
chugging
along
and
a
strong
economy
is
key
to
president
trump's
reelection
effort
in
he
has
tried
to
frame
the
fed
as
a
primary
culprit
if
there's
any
slowdown
indeed
trump
lashed
out
at
his
handpicked
central
bank
chief
on
twitter
within
minutes
of
the
rate
cut
announcement
calling
him
a
terrible
communicator
powell
declined
to
respond
to
trump's
tweet
or
his
other
recent
attacks
as
heather
notes
since
the
fed's
last
meeting
at
the
end
of
july
trump
has
tweeted
or
retweeted
times
criticizing
the
central
bank
and
calling
for
deeper
rate
cuts
he
has
called
powell
a
bonehead
and
enemy
for
not
lowering
rates
faster
i'm
not
going
to
change
my
practice
here
today
of
not
responding
to
comments
or
addressing
comments
made
by
elected
officials
powell
said
i
will
just
say
that
i
continue
to
believe
that
the
independence
of
the
federal
reserve
from
direct
political
control
has
served
the
public
well
over
time
and
i
assure
you
that
my
colleagues
and
i
will
continue
to
conduct
monetary
policy
without
regard
to
political
considerations
but
he
also
made
clear
without
invoking
trump
that
the
president's
trade
war
and
slowing
global
growth
are
driving
uncertainty
that
is
dragging
on
the
domestic
economy
trade
developments
have
been
up
and
down
and
then
up
i
guess
or
back
up
perhaps
over
the
course
of
this
inter-meeting
period
in
any
case
they've
been
quite
volatile
so
we
do
see
those
risks
as
actually
more
heightened
now
we're
going
to
be
watching
that
carefully
he
said
later
adding
we
do
feel
that
trade
uncertainty
is
having
an
effect

chalked
