the
good
news
is
that
it
doesn't
look
like
a
bitterly
polarized
washington
will
stumble
into
another
government
shutdown
but
as
democrats
controlling
the
house
unveil
a
stopgap
government-wide
spending
bill
to
keep
the
lights
on
and
pay
the
troops
there's
scant
evidence
that
power
sharing
in
the
u.s.
capitol
will
produce
further
legislative
accomplishments
anytime
soon

putting
her
stamp
on
the
health
care
issue
that
worries
consumers
the
most
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
thursday
unveiled
an
ambitious
plan
to
lower
drug
prices
for
seniors
on
medicare
and
younger
people
with
private
insurance
pelosi
d-calif
would
empower
medicare
to
negotiate
prices
for
the
costliest
drugs
including
insulin
pharmaceutical
companies
that
refuse
to
negotiate
could
face
steep
penalties
additionally
drugmakers
that
hike
prices
beyond
inflation
would
have
to
pay
rebates
to
medicare
the
plan
would
limit
copays
for
seniors
covered
by
medicare's
part
d
prescription
drug
program
to
and
medicare-negotiated
prices
would
be
available
to
other
buyers
such
as
employer
health
plans
the
plan
is
pelosi's
marker
in
what's
shaping
up
as
a
high-stakes
negotiation
to
determine
if
a
drug
pricing
compromise
can
pass
congress
this
year
or
if
democrats
and
republicans
will
take
their
differences
into
the
elections
the
sweeping
legislation
leans
left
politically
and
appears
to
be
tailor-made
for
pelosi's
democratic
majority
in
the
house
but
in
a
signal
that
pelosi
wants
a
deal
it
also
incorporates
ideas
from
the
trump
administration
and
from
republican
and
democratic
senators
a
group
of
house
republicans
led
by
rep
greg
walden
r-ore
quickly
accused
pelosi
of
putting
politics
over
progress
calling
her
plan
a
socialist
proposal
to
appease
her
most
extreme
members
nonetheless
americans
across
party
lines
say
lowering
prescription
drug
costs
should
be
a
top
priority
for
congress
this
year
overall
percent
deemed
that
a
top
priority
in
a
poll
earlier
this
month
from
the
nonpartisan
kaiser
family
foundation
president
donald
trump
appears
eager
to
sign
prescription
drug
legislation
and
lower
costs
but
most
republicans
oppose
the
medicare
negotiations
that
are
the
centerpiece
of
pelosi's
plan
the
law
that
created
medicare's
prescription
drug
benefit
barred
the
program
from
negotiating
prices
a
restriction
democrats
have
long
opposed
as
a
candidate
trump
backed
medicare
negotiations
but
after
trump
was
elected
president
he
seemed
to
revert
to
the
traditional
republican
position
that
price
negotiations
are
best
left
to
private
players
like
insurance
companies
with
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
profits
at
stake
drugmakers
are
determined
to
block
any
major
changes
to
payment
policies
but
the
industry's
powerful
lobbying
group
the
pharmaceutical
research
and
manufacturers
of
america
has
been
taking
fire
from
all
sides
from
liberal
democrats
to
pro-business
republicans
trump
once
accused
drug
companies
of
getting
away
with
murder
pelosi's
proposal
would
authorize
medicare
to
negotiate
prices
for
the
drugs
with
the
greatest
total
cost
to
the
program
and
the
u.s.
health
care
system
that
includes
pharmacy
drugs
covered
through
the
popular
part
d
prescription
benefit
along
with
part
b
medications
dispensed
in
doctors
offices
a
category
that
covers
many
cancer
drugs
the
maximum
price
would
be
determined
using
a
blend
of
international
prices
an
idea
similar
to
a
more
limited
proposal
from
the
trump
administration
insulin
prices
would
be
subject
to
negotiations
drug
companies
that
balk
at
making
a
deal
would
face
penalties
that
start
at
of
sales
for
the
drug
at
issue
and
would
escalate
if
they
hold
out
require
drugmakers
to
pay
rebates
to
medicare
if
they
hike
their
prices
beyond
the
increase
in
inflation
that
idea
resembles
a
bipartisan
plan
from
sens
chuck
grassley
r-iowa
and
ron
wyden
d-ore
the
senators
proposal
has
already
cleared
a
key
committee
with
trump's
support
but
many
senate
republicans
oppose
inflation
rebates
and
it's
unclear
what
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
plans
to
do
next
limit
what
seniors
pay
out
of
pocket
for
their
medications
to
a
year
currently
medicare's
pharmacy
benefit
has
no
cap
on
copays
and
the
advent
of
drugs
costing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
year
has
left
some
seniors
saddled
with
bills
that
rival
a
mortgage
payment
an
out-of-pocket
limit
also
is
part
of
the
grassley-wyden
bill
and
the
idea
also
is
backed
by
the
trump
administration
pelosi's
office
says
her
plan
is
to
have
the
legislation
introduced
and
moved
through
house
committees
to
a
vote
on
the
floor
if
compromise
can
be
reached
among
house
democrats
the
trump
white
house
and
enough
gop
lawmakers
a
drug
pricing
package
could
be
added
to
year-end
budget
legislation
movement
in
congress
comes
at
a
time
when
criticism
of
the
industry
from
trump
and
lawmakers
of
both
parties
appears
to
be
having
an
effect
on
prices
the
commerce
department's
inflation
index
for
prescription
drug
prices
has
declined
in
seven
of
the
last
eight
months
which
is
highly
unusual
that
index
includes
lower-cost
generic
drugs
the
story
is
different
for
brand
name
drugs
however
a
recent
analysis
by
the
associated
press
shows
that
on
average
prices
are
still
going
up
but
at
a
slower
pace
costly
brand-name
drugs
can
translate
to
steep
copays
for
insured
patients
the
ap
analysis
found
that
in
the
first
seven
months
of
drugmakers
raised
list
prices
for
brand
name
medicines
by
a
median
or
midpoint
of
that
does
reflect
a
slowdown
prices
were
going
up
or
over
those
months
the
prior
four
years
but
there
were
price
increases
for
every
decrease
in
the
first
seven
months
