the

that
it
doesn't
look

a
bitterly

washington
will
stumble
into
another

shutdown
but
as
democrats
controlling
the
house
unveil
a
stopgap
government-wide
spending
bill
to
keep
the

there's
scant

the
vote
in
the
democratic-run
house
on
the
bipartisan
plan
was
the
agency
spending

in
the
details
of
this
summer's
budget
and
debt
agreement
between

the
republican-controlled
senate
is
struggling
over
how
to
move
ahead
with
its
versions
of
the
follow-up
spending
bills
there
is
partisan
skirmishing
over
the
boundaries
of
the
budget
agreement
and
trump's
moves
to
pay
for
the
u.s.
mexico
border
fence
without
congressional
approval
the
senate
appropriations
committee
on
thursday
approved
three
noncontroversial
measures
on
unanimous
votes
as
the
sniping
continued
in
the
wake
of
wednesday's
democratic
filibuster
of
the
almost
billion
defense
bill
and
other
legislation
senate
democrats
accused
republicans
of
shortchanging
health
and
education
programs
to
finance
the
border
project
and
would
permit
the
president
to
transfer
military
dollars
for
the
wall
again
but
democrats
also
want
to
maintain
some
leverage
over
trump
by
holding
back
the
pentagon
measure
he
cares
most
in
order
to
help
force
compromises
on
the
domestic
bills
important
to
their
party
we're
at
a
crossroads
right
now
said
the
committee
chairman
sen
richard
shelby
r-ala
who
is
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
between
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
and
top
senate
democrat
chuck
schumer
of
new
york
i
don't
know
what
will
happen
in
the
house
pelosi
and
the
top
republican
simply
want
the
senate
to
act
the
second-ranking
house
democrat
rep
steny
hoyer
of
maryland
was
one
of
several
lawmakers
who
said
there's
no
reason
that
congress
cannot
complete
the
spending
bills
before
thanksgiving
i
had
discussions
yesterday
with
schumer
i
think
we
can
get
this
done
said
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-calif
who
called
the
senate's
battles
more
theatre
than
anything
i
think
we'll
get
it
done
the
house-passed
measure
also
extends
some
expiring
federal
programs
and
replenishes
trump's
bailout
of
farmers
who've
been
hurt
by
the
u.s.
trade
dispute
with
china
democrats
say
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
is
favoring
certain
crops
over
others
and
democrats
won
language
requiring
a
report
on
where
the
bailout
money
is
