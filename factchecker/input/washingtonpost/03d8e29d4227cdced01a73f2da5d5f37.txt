when
year-old
clarence
smoyer
came
to
washington
wednesday
he
thought

was
heading
to
the
pentagon
to
sign
copies
of
spearhead
a
recent
book
detailing
his
exploits
as
a
world
war
ii
tank
gunner
instead
he
found
a

and
ceremony
awarding
him
a
bronze

almost
years
after
the
battle
that
made

smoyer
of
allentown

was
part
of
a
famous
march
duel
in
cologne
germany
where
his
pershing
tank
destroyed
a
german
panther
tank
about
nine
months
after
d-day
the
battle
was
captured
on

and

became
known
as
the
hero
of
cologne
smoyer
was
told
he
would
receive
the
bronze
star
but
a
few
days
later
he
ran
afoul
of
a
minor
disciplinary
issue
that
cost
him
his
medal
a
military
police
officer
saw
him
searching
his
pockets
for
bubble
gum
to
give
to
a
crowd
of
german
children
and
charged
him
with
fraternization
with
the
enemy
meanwhile
smoyer's
tank
commander
and
the
military
cameraman
who
filmed
the
battle
received
bronze
stars
of
their
own
smoyer's
story
was
detailed
in
spearhead
by
author
adam
makos
and
it
was
makos
who
helped
engineer
wednesday's
events
he
helped
convince
the
army
to
reverse
what
he
saw
as
an
injustice
and
he
brought
smoyer
to
washington
on
the
pretense
of
a
book-signing
at
the
pentagon
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
saw
the
crowds
gathered
at
washington's

smoyer
smiled
broadly
