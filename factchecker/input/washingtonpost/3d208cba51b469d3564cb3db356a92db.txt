speaks
to
reporters
after
the
panel
met
behind
closed
doors
with
national
intelligence
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
about
a
whistleblower
complaint
at
the
capitol
in
washington

washington
the
trump
administration
plunged
into
an
extraordinary
showdown
with
congress
thursday
over
access
to
a
whistleblower's
reported
complaint
about
incidents
including
a
private
conversation
between
president
donald
trump
and
a
foreign
leader
the
blocked
complaint
is
both
serious
and
urgent
the
government's
intelligence
watchdog
said
the
administration
is
keeping
congress
from
even
learning
what
exactly
the
whistleblower
is
alleging
but
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
said
the
matter
involves
the
most
significant
responsibilities
of
intelligence
leadership
one
report
said
it
involved
a
promise
trump
made
in
a
phone
call
to
a
foreign
leader
a
lawmaker
said
the
complaint
was
based
on
a
series
of
events
the
inspector
general
appeared
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
behind
closed
doors
thursday
but
declined
under
administration
orders
to
reveal
to
members
the
substance
of
the
complaint
the
standoff
raises
fresh
questions
about
the
extent
to
which
trump's
allies
are
protecting
the
president
from
oversight
and
specifically
if
his
new
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
is
working
with
the
justice
department
to
shield
the
president
from
the
reach
of
congress
trump
though
giving
no
details
about
any
incident
denied
thursday
that
he
would
ever
say
something
inappropriate
on
such
a
call
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
the
chairman
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
said
he
was
prepared
to
go
to
court
to
try
to
force
the
trump
administration
to
open
up
about
the
complaint
the
inspector
general
has
said
this
cannot
wait
said
schiff
describing
the
administration's
blockade
as
an
unprecedented
departure
from
law
there's
an
urgency
here
that
i
think
the
courts
will
recognize
the
washington
post
reported
the
complaint
involves
an
intelligence
official's
allegation
that
trump
made
a
promise
to
an
unidentified
foreign
leader
in
a
telephone
call
the
post
cited
two
anonymous
former
u.s.
officials
the
associated
press
has
not
confirmed
the
report
schiff
said
he
too
could
not
confirm
whether
the
post
report
was
accurate
because
the
administration
was
claiming
executive
privilege
in
withholding
the
complaint
but
letters
from
the
inspector
general
to
the
committee
released
thursday
said
it
was
an
urgent
matter
of
serious
or
flagrant
abuse
that
must
be
shared
with
lawmakers
the
letters
also
made
it
clear
that
trump's
new
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
maguire
consulted
with
the
justice
department
in
deciding
not
to
transmit
the
complaint
to
congress
in
a
further
departure
from
standard
procedure
it's
unclear
whether
the
white
house
was
also
involved
schiff
said
because
the
administration
is
claiming
the
information
is
privileged
schiff
said
he
believes
the
whistleblower's
complaint
likely
involves
the
president
or
people
around
him
trump
dismissed
it
all
another
fake
news
story
out
there
it
never
ends
trump
tweeted
virtually
anytime
i
speak
on
the
phone
to
a
foreign
leader
i
understand
that
there
may
be
many
people
listening
from
various
u.s.
agencies
not
to
mention
those
from
the
other
country
itself
no
problem
he
asked
is
anybody
dumb
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
say
something
inappropriate
with
a
foreign
leader
while
on
such
a
potentially
heavily
populated
call
house
democrats
are
fighting
the
administration
separately
for
access
to
witnesses
and
documents
in
impeachment
probes
this
new
situation
has
led
to
their
public
concerns
that
government
intelligence
agencies
and
the
recently
named
acting
director
might
be
under
pressure
to
withhold
information
from
congress
trump
tapped
maguire
a
former
navy
official
as
acting
intelligence
director
in
august
after
the
departure
of
director
dan
coats
a
former
republican
senator
who
often
clashed
with
the
president
and
the
retirement
of
sue
gordon
a
career
professional
in
the
no
position
maguire
has
refused
to
discuss
details
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
but
he
has
been
subpoenaed
by
the
house
panel
and
is
expected
to
testify
publicly
next
thursday
both
maguire
and
the
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
are
also
expected
next
week
at
the
senate
intelligence
committee
atkinson
wrote
in
letters
that
schiff
released
thursday
that
he
and
maguire
had
hit
an
impasse
over
the
acting
director's
decision
not
to
share
the
complaint
with
congress
while
atkinson
wrote
that
he
believed
maguire's
position
was
in
good
faith
it
did
not
appear
to
be
consistent
with
past
practice
atkinson
said
he
was
told
by
the
legal
counsel
for
the
intelligence
director
that
the
complaint
did
not
actually
meet
the
definition
of
an
urgent
concern
and
he
said
the
justice
department
said
it
did
not
fall
under
the
director's
jurisdiction
because
it
did
not
involve
an
intelligence
professional
atkinson
said
he
disagreed
with
that
justice
department
view
the
complaint
not
only
falls
under
dni's
jurisdiction
atkinson
wrote
but
relates
to
one
of
the
most
significant
and
important
of
dni's
responsibilities
to
the
american
people
the
inspector
general
went
on
to
say
he
requested
authorization
to
at
the
very
least
disclose
the
general
subject
matter
to
the
committee
but
had
not
been
allowed
to
do
so
he
said
the
information
was
being
kept
from
congress
these
decisions
the
inspector
general
said
are
affecting
his
execution
of
his
duties
and
responsibilities
illinois
rep
mike
quigley
a
member
of
the
panel
said
atkinson
said
that
the
complaint
was
based
on
a
series
of
events
in
calling
the
inspector
general
to
testify
schiff
said
atkinson
determined
the
whistleblower
complaint
was
credible
and
urgent
and
should
be
transmitted
to
congress
the
inspector
general's
testimony
was
described
by
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
proceedings
they
were
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
meeting
by
name
and
were
granted
anonymity
several
lawmakers
suggested
the
failure
to
disclose
the
complaint's
contents
amounted
to
a
failure
to
protect
the
whistleblower
another
violation
however
the
general
counsel
for
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
jason
klitenic
wrote
in
a
letter
tuesday
to
the
committee
that
the
agency
was
indeed
protecting
the
whistleblower
andrew
bakaj
a
former
intelligence
officer
and
an
attorney
specializing
in
whistleblower
reprisal
investigations
confirmed
that
he
was
representing
the
whistleblower
but
declined
further
comment
rep
jim
himes
d-conn
said
on
msnbc
that
the
acting
director
broke
the
law
when
he
decided
to
basically
intercept
the
inspector
general's
report
to
congress
that's
never
been
done
before
in
the
history
of
inspector
general
reports
to
the
congress
himes
said
and
the
american
people
should
be
worried
about
that
himes
said
we
don't
know
exactly
what
is
in
the
substance
of
this
complaint
it
could
be
nothing
it
could
be
something
very
very
serious
