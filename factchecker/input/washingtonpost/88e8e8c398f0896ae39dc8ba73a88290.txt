trump's
favorite
tv
network
has
some
bad
news
about
his
reelection
prospects
president
trump
shown
sept
in
the
oval
office
trailed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
by
double
digits
in
a
fox
news
poll
released
wednesday
bill
o'leary
the
washington
post
the
election
will
not
be
held
tomorrow
which
is
almost
certainly
good
news
for
president
trump
a
poll
released
wednesday
by
fox
news
offers
numbers
stacking
trump
up
against
leading
democratic
candidates
in
next
year's
presidential
contest
trump
does
not
fare
well
he
does
not
fare
well
in
general
trailing
the
top-polling
democrat
former
vice
president
joe
biden
by
double
digits
he
does
not
fare
well
broadly
trailing
or
essentially
tied
with
three
other
democrats
he
does
not
fare
well
in
the
details
with
several
numbers
suggesting
that
he's
doing
poorly
with
some
groups
with
which
he
needs
to
do
well
and
that
voters
who
are
more
likely
to
oppose
him
are
also
more
likely
to
be
motivated
to
cast
a
ballot
it's
not
a
good
poll
let's
take
two
sets
of
numbers
by
way
of
explaining
how
bad
the
poll
is
for
trump
let's
look
at
the
head-to-head
preference
of
a
number
of
demographic
groups
and
compare
that
with
the
percentage
of
that
group
that
said
it
was
extremely
motivated
to
vote
in
and
let's
look
at
those
numbers
for
a
trump-biden
matchup
as
well
as
a
matchup
between
trump
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
that
gives
us
this
philip
bump
the
washington
post
now
let's
break
out
some
interesting
contrasts
for
example
let's
look
at
party
democrats
and
voters
who
supported
hillary
clinton
in
are
more
likely
to
say
they
are
extremely
motivated
to
vote
in
they
are
also
more
strongly
supportive
of
biden
than
republicans
and
trump
voters
are
of
trump
in
fact
according
to
this
poll
percent
of
those
who
voted
for
trump
in
would
pick
biden
over
him
next
year
the
overall
vote
there
in
the
middle
is
relatively
low
on
the
motivation
scale
because
it's
dragged
down
by
independents
who
aren't
super
excited
about
voting
in
the
election
only
about
a
third
of
independents
are
extremely
motivated
to
vote
they
also
like
biden
more
than
trump
but
are
split
in
a
trump-warren
contest
philip
bump
the
washington
post
you
may
have
noted
in
the
first
graph
that
the
light-blue
dots
warren
are
consistently
to
the
right
of
the
dark-blue
ones
in
other
words
while
warren
has
more
support
overall
than
trump
biden's
margins
against
trump
are
consistently
better
fox
also
polled
democratic
primary
voters
who
are
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
say
biden
has
the
best
chance
of
beating
trump
as
they
are
to
say
that
of
warren
now
let's
look
at
race
and
gender
women
are
more
likely
to
be
extremely
motivated
than
men
and
more
likely
to
support
the
democrats
but
whites
are
more
motivated
than
nonwhites
there
are
a
lot
more
white
voters
than
nonwhite
voters
of
course
about
a
to-
margin
in
recent
presidential
contests
but
that's
offset
by
the
split
vote
among
whites
and
the
strong
support
for
the
democratic
candidates
among
nonwhites
philip
bump
the
washington
post
notice
too
the
gap
between
the
light-
and
dark-blue
dots
among
nonwhites
nonwhite
voters
like
biden
against
trump
more
than
they
do
warren
a
dynamic
that
also
appears
in
primary
polling
in
fox's
poll
biden
gets
three
times
as
much
support
as
warren
from
nonwhite
democratic
primary
voters
diving
a
level
deeper
we
break
out
the
white
vote
by
education
level
whites
with
a
college
degree
lean
for
the
democratic
candidates
and
are
a
lot
more
likely
to
be
extremely
motivated
to
vote
than
the
more
trump-friendly
demographic
of
whites
without
a
degree
philip
bump
the
washington
post
we
broke
out
two
groups
specifically
the
first
is
white
women
without
a
college
degree
a
group
that
backed
trump
by
points
in
in
a
biden-trump
contest
they
prefer
trump
by
one
point
suburban
women
have
been
a
focus
of
recent
political
analysis
given
polling
showing
them
turning
dramatically
away
from
the
republican
party
under
trump
in
the
midterms
they
helped
the
democrats
take
a
slew
of
suburban
house
districts
previously
held
by
a
republican
in
this
fox
news
poll
that
group
prefers
warren
to
trump
by
points
they
prefer
biden
to
trump
by
no
wonder
biden
leads
trump
by
points
overall
so
what
did
trump
do
now
that
he
has
access
to
new
survey
data
from
his
favorite
cable
network
he
tweeted
some
poll
numbers
from
rasmussen
reports
a
polling
outlet
that
is
consistently
friendlier
to
trump
and
his
party
than
other
pollsters
rasmussen
estimated
a
one-point
advantage
for
the
gop
in
the
midterms
for
example
sure
maybe
fox
said
biden
was
winning
a
head-to-head
contest
but
rasmussen
said
trump's
approval
was
percent
a
figure
that's
lower
than
support
for
biden
in
that
fox
poll
he
has
tweeted
basically
the
same
thing
down
to
the
picture
dozens
of
times
