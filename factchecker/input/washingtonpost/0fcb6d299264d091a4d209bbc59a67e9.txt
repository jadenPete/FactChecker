joe

iii
a
scion
of
one
of
america's
most
storied
political
families
is
set
to
announce
he
will
challenge
u.s.
sen
edward
markey
in
the
state's
democratic
primary
in
a
person
with
knowledge
of
kennedy's
plans
told
the
associated
press
that
kennedy
will
formally
make
the
announcement
saturday
the
person
wasn't
authorized
to
preempt
kennedy's
announcement
and
spoke
wednesday
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
year-old
grandson
of
robert
kennedy
has
been
quietly
laying
down
the
foundation
of
a
run
building
up
his
staff
and
formally
announcing
his
intentions
by
filing
preliminary
paperwork
with
the
federal
election
commission
last
month
i
don't
think
primaries
are
something
that
people
should
shy
away
from
kennedy
told
reporters
at
the
state
democratic
convention
on
saturday
the
idea
behind
it
is
that
every
seat
my
own
included
the
one
that
i
currently
occupy
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
it's
up
every
two
years
it's
a
two-year
term
you
have
to
go
out
and
make
that
case
to
voters
every
two
years
kennedy
has
shied
away
from
directly
criticizing
markey
calling
him
a
good
man
markey
who's
already
facing
two
lesser-known
challengers
has
said
he's
ready
to
take
on
anyone
even
kennedy
i
run
every
day
on
the
issues
that
i've
been
fighting
for
throughout
my
career
and
that
i'm
continuing
to
fight
for
right
now
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
that's
women's
reproductive
rights
climate
change
gun
safety
laws
income
inequality
and
i'm
going
to
continue
to
campaign
on
those
issues
the
year-old
markey
said
at
the
same
convention
it's
been
the
core
of
my
agenda
given
his
political
pedigree
kennedy
has
been
seen
as
a
rising
star
in
the
party
in
kennedy
was
tapped
to
deliver
the
democratic
response
to
president
donald
trump's
state
of
the
union
address
a
kennedy-markey
contest
will
put
more
than
a
few
high-profile
democrats
in
an
awkward
position
most
notably
white
house
hopeful
elizabeth
warren
warren
has
worked
with
markey
in
the
senate
and
taught
kennedy
at
harvard
law
school
she
formally
endorsed
markey
before
kennedy
floated
the
idea
of
a
challenge
to
markey
i
endorsed
sen
markey
back
in
february
i
couldn't
ask
for
a
better
partner
in
the
senate
than
ed
markey
he
is
a
good
friend
warren
said
joe
kennedy
is
also
a
good
friend
i
have
worked
with
him
since
he
was
a
student
of
mine
both
he
and
his
wife
were
my
students
i
have
worked
with
him
as
a
congressman
i
have
nothing
but
the
highest
respect
for
him
and
i
have
no
criticism
kennedy
whose
father
joe
kennedy
ii
also
served
in
the
u.s.
house
has
tried
to
position
himself
as
more
of
a
pragmatist
than
those
on
the
left
of
his
party
although
he's
adopted
many
of
the
causes
driving
the
party's
liberal
wing
kennedy
has
called
for
congress
to
initiate
impeachment
efforts
against
trump
and
has
backed
a
medicare
for
all
bill
in
the
house
he's
also
tried
to
carve
out
his
own
path
in
january
as
many
democrats
were
still
reeling
from
trump's
win
kennedy
first
elected
to
congress
in
suggested
that
party
leaders
should
be
listening
better
to
the
economic
worries
of
democratic
voters
who
bolted
the
party
for
trump
saying
that
not
taking
the
time
to
understand
those
voters
would
be
folly
he
also
argued
that
democrats
then
in
the
minority
in
the
house
had
to
try
to
cut
the
best
deals
they
could
with
republicans
you've
got
to
fight
but
you've
got
to
also
try
to
move
an
agenda
forward
he
said
at
the
time
if
you're
just
out
there
screaming
and
yelling
there
are
people
out
there
who
need
help
and
need
help
now
and
they
deserve
progress
too
markey
is
a
formable
opponent
he
served
for
decades
in
the
house
before
joining
the
senate
in
markey
has
been
quick
to
point
out
his
endorsement
by
democratic
u.s.
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
of
new
york
the
two
have
worked
to
push
for
the
green
new
deal
initiative
the
green
new
deal
will
be
the
greatest
force
for
blue-collar
job
creation
in
a
generation
markey
has
said
markey
has
also
called
for
the
house
to
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump

already
facing
two
lesser-known
candidates
shannon
liss-riordan
a
workers
rights
lawyer
and
steve
pemberton
a
former
senior
executive
at
walgreens
the
contest
could
be
expensive
