trump
debunks
kellyanne
conway's
talking
point
that
he's
uniting
the
country
the
president's
white
house
counselor
undermined
her
own
claims
as
trump
disproved
them
kellyanne
conway
president
donald
trump's
white
house
counselor
claimed
on
tuesday
morning
that
her
boss
is
trying
to
bring
the
country
together
and
heal
a
nation
after
mass
shootings
at
least
one
of
which
appears
to
have
been
inspired
by
his
own
anti-immigrant
demagoguery
moments
later
both
conway
and
trump
demonstrated
how
dishonest
that
talking
point
was
conway
attempted
to
present
trump
as
a
statesmanlike
leader
bent
on
staying
above
the
fray
in
a
time
of
national
tragedy
while
others
attempt
to
politicize
the
moment
during
a
tuesday
morning
appearance
on
the
fox
news
channel
it
has
been
his
desire
and
his
intention
since
he
learned
of
these
tragedies
over
the
weekend
to
get
on
the
ground
and
visit
the
people
there
to
thank
the
first
responders
and
the
medical
professionals
to
meet
those
who
are
healing
from
their
wounds
to
talk
to
law
enforcement
and
federal
fbi
agents
and
others
who
are
still
on
the
ground
offering
resources
and
support
she
said
so
this
is
what
he
has
done
conway
continued
and
i
think
you
saw
a
preview
of
that
yesterday
here
in
the
white
house
when
despite
the
politicization
of
his
political
opponents
the
president
is
trying
to
bring
the
country
together
heal
a
nation
but
also
offer
concrete
proposals
on
how
to
move
forward
as
a
nation
but
in
the
very
next
sentence
after
claiming
that
the
trump
white
house
was
above
the
fray
conway
proceeded
to
politicize
the
tragedy
herself
though
the
motive
in
the
dayton
shooting
is
not
yet
clear
she
called
herself
hopping
mad
that
the
media
has
provided
very
little
scant
coverage
of
the
fact
that
this
dayton
shooter
has
been
confirmed
as
having
a
twitter
feed
that
was
supportive
of
antifa
that
was
supportive
of
elizabeth
warren
bernie
sanders
she
also
complained
that
some
democratic
politicians
had
blamed
trump's
racist
rhetoric
and
actions
for
the
rise
in
white
nationalist
violence
this
is
a
disgrace
she
said
bragging
that
the
president
did
not
respond
in
kind
but
less
than
an
hour
earlier
trump
had
indeed
responded
in
kind
he
blasted
former
president
barack
obama
who
had
condemned
the
rise
in
racist
rhetoric
in
a
tweet
kellyanne's
husband
george
conway
who
has
been
a
prominent
conservative
critic
of
trump
during
his
tenure
in
office
pointed
out
that
unlike
previous
presidents
trump's
racist
comments
were
apparently
parroted
in
the
manifesto
of
the
el
paso
mass
shooter
trump
also
demonstrated
that
his
focus
on
appearing
to
bring
the
nation
together
was
short-lived
at
best
while
conway
appeared
on
fox
news
trump
engaged
in
a
twitter
storm
accusing
google
without
evidence
of
very
illegal
actions
in
to
subvert
his
presidential
campaign
