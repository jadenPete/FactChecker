donald
trump
was
having
second
thoughts
on
his
trade
war
with
china
for
about
an
hour
i
have
second
thoughts
about
everything
he
said
that
apparently
includes
second
thoughts
about
his
second
thoughts
donald
trump
is
currently
abroad
attending
the
g-
summit
in
france
on
sunday
morning
a
reporter
asked
trump
about
his
escalating
trade
war
with
china
wondering
if
he
had
any
regrets
about
antagonizing
the
world's
second
largest
economy
yeah
sure
why
not
said
trump
when
pushed
on
whether
he
was
having
second
thoughts
might
as
well
he
continued
might
as
well
i
have
second
thoughts
about
everything
his
statement
was
a
rare
admission
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
from
a
person
diametrically
opposed
to
any
semblance
of
weakness
so
uncharacteristic
were
his
comments
the
new
york
times
saw
fit
to
send
out
a
news
alert
with
his
remarks
shortly
past
am
eastern
time
within
hours
though
the
gaslighters
working
in
the
white
house
kicked
into
overdrive
seeking
to
clarify
trump's
comments
by
suggesting
he
never
said
he
had
second
thoughts
about
his
trade
war
with
china
but
rather
his
only
regret
was
not
raising
tariffs
even
higher
it
turns
out
even
his
second
thoughts
have
second
thoughts
the
effects
of
donald
trump's
unilateral
standoff
with
china
have
already
started
to
manifest
in
the
u.s.
economy
in
response
to
the
white
house
raising
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
china
has
responded
by
imposing
tariffs
of
their
own
hitting
u.s.
auto
manufacturers
and
agricultural
workers
especially
hard
starting
on
september
china
says
it
will
impose
a
further
tariff
on
soybeans
and
a
hike
on
pork
futures
for
both
products
slumped
as
did
the
economic
forecasts
for
other
agricultural
products
like
cotton
as
well
as
manufacturing
companies
with
close
ties
to
the
agriculture
sector
like
john
deere
trump's
trade
war
is
testing
the
patience
of
american
farmers
a
key
constituency
that
propelled
him
into
the
white
house
in
the
first
place
the
national
farmers
union
which
represents
roughly
family
farmers
across
the
country
issued
a
scathing
statement
on
friday
after
china
announced
their
latest
retaliatory
tariffs
slamming
the
white
house
for
worsening
their
economic
situation
since
trump
took
office
rather
than
alleviating
it
between
burning
bridges
with
all
of
our
biggest
trading
partners
and
undermining
our
domestic
biofuels
industry
president
trump
is
making
things
worse
not
better
the
statement
read
earlier
this
month
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
made
an
appearance
at
a
gathering
for
farmers
in
minnesota
and
was
promptly
booed
off
stage
after
cracking
a
joke
at
farmers
expense
in
addition
to
their
economic
implications
trump's
conflicting
statements
on
sunday
perfectly
encapsulate
the
defining
quality
of
his
administration
unapologetic
incompetence
framing
trump's
fleeting
regret
over
launching
a
trade
war
with
an
economic
superpower
as
having
second
thoughts
is
likely
too
generous
an
interpretation
because
it
implies
donald
trump
gave
it
a
moment's
thought
in
the
first
place
his
entire
political
agenda
is
based
on
the
regurgitation
of
whatever
soundbite
or
cockamamie
idea
is
whispered
into
his
ear
by
an
ideologue
with
white
house
credentials
or
piped
onto
his
television
most
recently
which
then
ricochets
around
his
vacant
head
until
it
worms
its
way
into
a
tweet
or
out
of
his
mouth
at
an
impromptu
press
conference
next
to
marine
force
one
what
so
often
comes
across
as
second
guessing
is
in
fact
donald
trump
coming
face
to
face
with
his
own
words
and
decisions
for
the
very
first
time
outside
the
comfort
of
his
aides
and
allies
and
feebly
trying
to
have
an
original
thought
about
them
before
being
quickly
corralled
back
to
safety
by
his
handlers
just
because
his
set
is
now
the
white
house
instead
of
a
board
room
constructed
on
a
sound
stage
doesn't
mean
donald
trump
is
without
executive
producers
