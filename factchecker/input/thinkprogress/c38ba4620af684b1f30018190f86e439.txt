california
is
gaining
allies
in
its
emissions
standards
war
with
trump
a
national
divide
is
growing
more
and
more
states
and
automakers
are
uniting
behind
california
in
a
nationwide
debate
over
vehicle
emissions
standards
as
tensions
between
the
golden
state
and
president
donald
trump's
administration
come
to
a
head
a
growing
coalition
of
states
is
supporting
california's
efforts
to
demand
cleaner
and
more
efficient
vehicles
at
a
time
when
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
and
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
nhtsa
are
seeking
to
halt
standards
despite
objections
from
health
and
climate
experts
those
states
are
now
being
joined
by
several
major
automakers
with
others
facing
pressure
from
lawmakers
three
weeks
ago
california
inked
a
deal
with
four
major
automakers
committing
them
to
increasing
both
gas
mileage
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
standards
in
exceedance
of
the
trump
administration's
proposal
now
others
are
under
pressure
to
do
the
same
eight
senior
house
democrats
wrote
to
other
automakers
on
thursday
encouraging
them
to
sign
on
to
the
same
deal
california
made
with
ford
bmw
honda
and
volkswagen
our
districts
and
the
country
as
a
whole
need
the
auto
industry
to
help
us
address
climate
change
and
in
the
near-term
that
means
a
serious
commitment
to
greenhouse
gas
reduction
through
emission
reduction
from
vehicles
wrote
lawmakers
led
by
reps
doris
matsui
d-ca
and
paul
tonko
d-ny
the
latter
of
whom
is
chairman
of
the
house
energy
and
commerce
environment
and
climate
change
subcommittee
recipients
included
major
automakers
like
volvo
chrysler
and
toyota
that
appeal
echoes
an
earlier
effort
from
senate
democrats
who
last
week
similarly
called
on
automakers
to
join
their
peers
in
adhering
to
stricter
standards
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
between
the
federal
government
and
states
the
california
agreement
is
a
commonsense
framework
that
provides
flexibility
to
the
industry
to
meet
tailpipe
standards
while
also
taking
important
steps
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
save
money
on
fuel
for
consumers
that
letter
reads
the
deal
the
california
air
resources
board
carb
struck
with
the
four
automakers
would
see
the
average
fuel
economy
of
fleets
increase
to
miles
per
gallon
by
that
commitment
is
less
than
obama-era
efforts
which
would
have
seen
miles
per
gallon
by
but
it
still
marks
a
major
break
with
the
trump
administration
under
the
clean
air
act
california
has
for
decades
been
granted
a
waiver
allowing
the
state
to
impose
vehicle
emissions
standards
exceeding
those
of
the
federal
government
but
the
trump
administration
has
sought
to
undermine
the
state
with
its
proposed
safer
affordable
fuel-efficient
safe
vehicles
rule
the
epa
and
nhtsa
are
proposing
freezing
federal
fuel
economy
standards
at
levels
a
move
environmental
and
public
health
experts
have
said
would
have
swift
repercussions
data
shows
that
air
quality
has
improved
significantly
as
a
result
of
the
stricter
standards
california
has
aggressively
sought
to
protect
its
standards
suing
the
federal
government
over
the
rollback
and
automakers
have
an
incentive
to
side
with
california
while
the
oil
and
gas
industry
has
lobbied
hard
for
easing
emissions
standards
many
automakers
have
grown
worried
by
the
scope
of
the
administration's
rollbacks
one
serious
concern
has
been
the
prospect
of
a
split
market
wherein
the
industry
would
have
to
meet
different
standards
in
different
states
in
june
car
companies
wrote
to
trump
and
warned
that
weakening
standards
regardless
could
destabilize
the
industry
support
from
other
states
is
also
giving
california
a
boost
twelve
states
and
washington
d.c.
were
already
committed
to
california's
standards
prior
to
the
trump
administration
but
colorado
an
oil-rich
state
recently
joined
that
lineup
becoming
a
section
state
in
a
nod
to
the
section
of
the
clean
air
act
that
allows
for
california's
stricter
standards
new
mexico
another
oil
state
also
has
plans
to
re-join
by
the
end
of
the
state
had
initially
joined
but
repealed
the
standards
under
republican
gov
susana
martinez
arizona
and
florida
have
similarly
adopted
and
then
repealed
the
standards
environmental
groups
have
expressed
optimism
that
other
states
may
adopt
california's
approach
especially
amid
growing
concerns
over
the
potential
ramifications
of
the
rollback
research
released
last
week
by
the
environmental
policy
group
energy
innovation
found
that
the
trump
administration's
efforts
could
cost
the
u.s.
economy
billion
through
in
addition
to
increasing
u.s.
transport
emissions
up
to
by
and
with
litigation
underway
conversations
about
auto
emissions
and
climate
change
are
already
proving
contentious
the
washington
post
reported
on
friday
that
a
federal
judge
who
was
set
to
hear
the
vehicle
emissions
case
between
the
epa
and
the
consortium
of
states
led
by
california
was
replaced
on
that
panel
after
he
sent
emails
critical
of
climate
science
the
judge
a.
raymond
randolph
had
complained
in
a
reply-all
email
to
a
colleague
about
a
seminar
on
climate
change
science
for
judges
the
jurisdiction
assigned
to
you
does
not
include
saving
the
planet
a
little
hubris
would
be
welcomed
in
many
of
your
latest
public
displays
randolph
wrote
the
supposedly
science
and
stuff
you
are
now
sponsoring
is
nothing
of
the
sort
get
out
of
this
business
and
back
into
the
business
of
judging
which
is
what
you
are
being
paid
to
do
randolph
has
been
replaced
on
the
panel
by
sri
srinivasan
a
barack
obama
appointee
