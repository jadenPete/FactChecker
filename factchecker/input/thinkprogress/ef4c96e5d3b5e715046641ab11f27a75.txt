nra
melts
down
over
walmart
decision
to
reduce
its
ammo
sales
the
gun-rights
group
is
angry
that
in
a
free
market
sometimes
people
choose
not
to
arm
mass
shooters
weeks
after
two
deadly
shootings
in
their
stores
walmart
announced
tuesday
that
it
would
stop
selling
ammunition
for
assault-style
rifles
and
handguns
the
national
rifle
association
nra
which
claims
to
be
the
nation's
oldest
civil
rights
organization
and
a
fierce
defender
of
the
free
market
responded
by
accusing
the
retail
giant
of
attacking
the
second
amendment
walmart
faced
considerable
pressure
from
its
own
employees
and
customers
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
sale
of
guns
and
ammunition
in
light
of
the
latest
deadly
mass
shootings
stores
in
el
paso
texas
and
in
mississippi
last
month
were
the
latest
walmart
locations
to
be
home
to
such
attacks
after
making
the
announcement
the
nra
quickly
called
the
company's
decision
a
shameful
cave
to
the
pressure
of
the
anti-gun
elites
the
nra
wrote
that
the
strongest
defense
of
freedom
has
always
been
our
free
market
economy
but
apparently
their
support
for
the
free
market
does
not
include
companies
getting
to
choose
which
goods
and
services
to
sell
