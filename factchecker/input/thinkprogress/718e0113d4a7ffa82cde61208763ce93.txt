retiring
congressman

to
rely
on

pledging
not
to
duffy
voted
to
roll
back
the
protections
he
will
need
to
use
after
his
ninth
child
is
born
rep
sean
duffy
r-wi
announced
on
monday
that
he
will
soon
resign
his
house
seat
citing
family
reasons
he
and
his
wife
fox
news
contributor
rachel
campos-duffy
said
their
soon-to-be
born
ninth
child
will
require
heart
surgery
soon
after
her
birth
on
tuesday
duffy
explained
that
he
had
made
sure
the
child
will
have
access
to
health
insurance
despite
her
pre-existing
conditions
it
is
laudable
that
the
duffy
family
is
preparing
to
provide
as
much
care
as
possible
for
a
child
with
serious
medical
challenges
but
as
a
congressman
duffy
voted
to
take
away
those
same
important
protections
for
others
with
pre-existing
conditions
directly
contradicting
his
own
campaign
promises
the
couple
went
on
fox
news
on
tuesday
morning
to
explain
their
decision
and
situation
both
discussed
the
challenging
schedule
a
member
of
congress
must
endure
and
expressed
their
commitment
to
being
present
for
their
family
duffy
was
asked
what
he
and
his
wife
planned
to
do
about
healthcare
in
light
of
the
pre-existing
condition
their
daughter
will
be
born
with
and
his
resignation
from
his
job
he
noted
that
former
members
of
congress
don't
get
health
insurance
for
life
and
explained
he
plans
to
get
a
cobra
plan
for
his
family
utilizing
a
law
that
allows
people
to
pay
to
stay
on
their
employers
health
plans
at
their
own
expense
for
up
to
months
after
leaving
a
job
we
pay
the
full
boat
for
that
so
we
can
transition
and
with
the
condition
of
the
baby
we
have
that
complete
coverage
duffy
said
but
yeah
you
are
right
i
had
to
look
at
that
and
make
sure
that
with
open
heart
surgery
we
had
coverage
to
make
sure
that
you
know
we
could
pay
for
that
and
we
have
got
that
worked
out
so
thank
god
that's
not
a
consideration
as
we
look
to
the
birth
while
his
daughter's
coverage
will
be
protected
for
up
to
months
after
that
in
order
to
insure
her
the
duffys
will
need
those
pre-existing
condition
protections
while
duffy
promised
as
a
candidate
that
he
would
protect
insurance
coverage
for
those
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
would
not
back
any
repeal
of
the
affordable
care
act
commonly
known
as
obamacare
that
did
not
include
a
replacement
with
comparable
protections
his
record
in
congress
shows
just
the
opposite
a
politifact
examination
of
duffy's
vote
to
fully
repeal
obamacare
with
no
replacement
noted
that
as
a
candidate
he
vowed
he
would
not
vote
to
repeal
the
legislation
unless
a
better
proposal
was
in
place
months
later
he
voted
to
repeal
the
legislation
without
any
replacement
politifact
dubbed
this
vote
a
full
flop
during
his
eight
years
in
congress
duffy
repeatedly
voted
to
destroy
obamacare
and
undermine
the
pre-existing
condition
protections
he
enthusiastically
voted
for
trumpcare
in
which
would
have
made
insurance
coverage
significantly
less
affordable
for
those
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
just
this
may
he
voted
against
the
protecting
americans
with
preexisting
conditions
act
of
while
legislative
obamacare
repeal
efforts
are
unlikely
to
go
anywhere
as
long
as
democrats
control
the
house
of
representatives
a
trump
administration-backed
lawsuit
could
imperil
the
law
and
some
congressional
republicans
have
promised
to
kill
the
law
in
if
they
regain
full
control
of
the
federal
government
this
story
has
been
updated
to
clarify
that
the
pre-existing
conditions
protection
will
be
necessary
after
the
cobra
period
is
over
