nra-funded
congressman
attacks
bipartisan
gun
control
legislation
that
even
trump
supports
rep
brian
babin
r-tx
demands
a
bill
that
will
not
be
an
infringement
on
anyone's
civil
rights
a
way
to
be
able
to
grab
someone's
guns
or
lock
them
up
or
do
anything
like
that
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
endorsed
red
flag
laws
to
make
sure
that
those
judged
to
pose
a
grave
risk
to
public
safety
do
not
have
access
to
firearms
and
that
if
they
do
those
firearms
can
be
taken
through
rapid
due
process
an
nra-backed
texas
republican
congressman
is
pushing
back
in
a
fox
news
interview
on
tuesday
rep
brian
babin
r-tx
attacked
the
popular
bipartisan
proposal
as
an
infringement
of
constitutional
rights
babin
a
third-term
congressman
who
has
already
received
thousands
of
dollars
in
campaign
contributions
from
the
national
rifle
association
nra
and
the
firearms
industry
proposed
instead
that
washington
enact
his
own
bill
that
would
promote
threat
assessment
but
not
expand
any
gun
laws
during
the
interview
babin
was
asked
about
efforts
by
lawmakers
such
as
sens
lindsey
graham
r-sc
and
richard
blumenthal
d-ct
to
enact
red
flag
legislation
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
people
like
those
responsible
for
two
mass
shootings
over
the
weekend
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
babin
acknowledged
that
such
laws
might
help
keep
people
safe
but
decried
them
anyway
red
flag
laws
do
have
potential
to
stop
it
but
also
to
do
harm
as
well
because
a
red
flag
law
is
an
infringement
can
be
used
to
infringe
upon
your
constitutional
rights
not
saying
it
will
happen
but
it
could
happen
he
explained
he
then
held
up
a
handwritten
sheet
of
paper
to
propose
his
threat
assessment
prevention
and
safety
act
of
taps
act
calling
it
a
solution
this
will
not
be
an
infringement
on
anyone's
civil
rights
a
way
to
be
able
to
grab
someone's
guns
or
lock
them
up
or
do
anything
like
that
he
boasted
noting
that
this
is
not
an
expansion
of
any
law
babin's
proposed
legislation
calls
for
increased
funding
to
assess
threats
but
expressly
prohibits
any
of
those
funds
being
used
to
teach
gun
safety
or
to
encourage
or
discourage
the
otherwise
legal
ownership
and
use
of
firearms
pushed
as
to
whether
it
is
appropriate
for
civilians
to
have
access
to
ak-
s
that
can
kill
many
people
in
mere
seconds
babin
dismissed
the
idea
and
parroted
the
nra's
frequent
talking
points
we
always
see
a
knee-jerk
reaction
the
democrats
go
to
gun-control
the
republicans
go
to
let's
arm
everybody
we
have
to
get
away
from
the
weapon
and
the
instrument
of
use
here
we've
got
to
be
proactive
he
answered
once
the
first
shot
is
fired
you're
too
late
you
can't
be
reactive
and
that's
why
we
have
to
be
proactive
the
taps
act
hr
would
be
proactive
we
can
get
this
and
do
it
bipartisanly
the
people
want
it
polls
show
that
what
most
people
want
is
action
more
than
three-fifths
of
americans
believe
gun
laws
should
be
more
strict
than
they
are
now
some
support
requiring
universal
background
checks
for
all
gun
purchases
and
a
sizable
majority
also
supports
a
ban
on
the
sale
of
semi-automatic
assault
rifles
still
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
thus
far
blocked
all
meaningful
action
on
gun
violence
and
has
ignored
calls
to
bring
the
senate
back
from
recess
to
consider
legislation
babin's
official
house
website
boasts
of
his
intransigent
gun
rights
positions
i
know
firsthand
the
importance
of
gun
ownership
to
those
of
us
who
call
the
lone
star
state
home
he
writes
i
am
fully
committed
to
supporting
the
second
amendment
as
a
protected
right
guaranteed
to
individuals
in
the
u.s.
constitution
my
work
in
the
congress
has
earned
me
top
ratings
from
the
national
rifle
association
nra
and
gun
owners
of
america
goa
as
a
member
of
the
congressional
sportsmen's
caucus
and
the
congressional
second
amendment
caucus
he
added
we
are
working
to
protect
these
rights
from
gun-grabbing
extremists
