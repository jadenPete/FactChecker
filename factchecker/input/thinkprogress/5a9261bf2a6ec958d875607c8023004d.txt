trump
wants
to
take
executive
action
on
guns
after
criticizing
obama
for
doing
just
that
he'd
be
doing
exactly
what
he
criticized
obama
for
in
the
wake
of
a
string
of
mass
shootings
across
the
country
president
donald
trump
is
exploring
taking
some
executive
or
administrative
actions
to
address
the
gun
epidemic
according
to
politico
if
he
does
circumvent
congress
to
enact
gun
reform
he
would
be
directly
contradicting
his
past
criticisms
of
president
barack
obama
trump's
core
policy
inclination
has
been
to
oppose
anything
that
had
obama's
fingerprints
on
it
in
when
the
obama
administration
was
considering
using
executive
orders
to
address
guns
trump
was
vehemently
opposed
this
is
how
it
starts
obama
is
now
threatening
to
use
an
executive
order
for
gun
control
he
tweeted
at
the
time
ultimately
obama
never
used
an
executive
order
to
reform
gun
laws
but
he
did
take
several
executive
actions
a
few
years
later
in
such
as
overhauling
the
background
check
system
and
hiring
more
agents
to
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
atf
obama
also
instituted
a
rule
requiring
the
social
security
administration
ssa
to
keep
the
background
check
system
apprised
of
recipients
who
are
prohibited
from
owning
a
gun
for
mental
health
reasons
a
rule
trump
rescinded
early
into
his
administration
despite
his
past
criticisms
of
obama's
use
of
executive
power
trump
has
used
his
power
in
the
same
way
he
already
banned
bump
stocks
which
allow
semi-automatic
weapons
to
fire
more
rapidly
through
executive
action
much
in
the
same
way
obama
issued
the
ssa
rule
beyond
the
issue
of
guns
trump
also
used
his
national
emergency
powers
to
circumvent
congress
and
pay
for
his
border
wall
and
he
also
recently
used
an
executive
order
to
force
the
collection
of
citizenship
data
by
federal
agencies
after
his
administration
failed
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
though
attorney
general
william
barr
has
been
rather
subservient
to
trump's
leadership
so
far
he
strongly
supports
more
gun
control
restriction
in
fact
many
gun
groups
opposed
his
nomination
earlier
this
year
because
he
believes
in
reasonable
regulation
of
the
second
amendment
he
also
specifically
supports
extreme
risk
protection
orders
commonly
known
as
red
flag
laws
which
allow
family
members
or
police
to
request
courts
take
guns
away
if
someone
is
acting
in
a
way
that
could
be
a
threat
to
themselves
or
others
trump
already
voiced
support
for
such
a
proposal
this
week
given
this
internal
pressure
trump
could
ultimately
take
actions
that
actually
do
help
curb
gun
violence
but
it
will
likely
will
require
him
to
contradict
his
own
past
opposition
to
gun
control
and
his
promises
to
gun
groups
for
example
although
trump
appeared
to
support
background
checks
in
to
weed
out
the
sicko's
sic
he
also
opposed
any
form
of
gun
registration
system
and
more
generally
expressed
opposition
to
any
kind
of
gun
control
in
trump
gave
an
interview
to
ammoland
in
which
he
falsely
asserted
gun
control
does
not
reduce
crime
he
confirmed
that
he
actually
opposes
background
checks
i
do
not
support
expanding
background
checks
he
said
at
the
time
because
the
current
background
checks
do
not
work
in
a
statement
at
the
time
that
would
contradict
his
future
bump
stock
ban
he
also
claimed
that
gun
magazine
limits
do
not
make
common
sense
it
remains
unclear
what
executive
actions
the
administration
is
even
considering
in
trump's
remarks
about
the
recent
shootings
monday
he
didn't
even
mention
any
possible
solution
related
to
curbing
guns
instead
he
repeated
myths
about
the
impact
of
video
games
and
mental
health
on
shootings
if
the
crisis
of
the
moment
convinces
him
that
something
has
to
be
done
about
the
availability
of
guns
he
will
have
to
engage
in
blatant
political
hypocrisy
to
accomplish
it
which
unfortunately
could
be
the
very
reason
he
never
does
