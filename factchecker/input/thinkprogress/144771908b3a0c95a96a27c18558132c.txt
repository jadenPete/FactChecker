koch-linked
dark
money
group
accuses
grassley
of
promoting
socialism
the
american
future
fund
is
running
ads
suggesting
that
a
bipartisan
bill
to
reduce
medicare
prescription
costs
would
mean
no
cure
for
cancer
and
alzheimer's
a
conservative
dark
money
group
has
launched
a
series
of
radio
ads
attacking
a
bipartisan
bill
authored
by
the
senior
republican
in
the
united
states
senate
iowa's
chuck
grassley
joining
in
the
right's
everything
we
don't
like
is
socialism
parade
the
group
suggests
that
by
reducing
the
amount
senior
citizens
and
government
insurance
programs
pay
for
prescription
drugs
the
bill
is
a
socialistic
plot
that
would
stop
pharmaceutical
companies
from
curing
disease
the
ads
posted
online
wednesday
come
from
a
shadowy
right-wing
attack
group
called
american
future
fund
while
the
tax-exempt
organization
does
not
disclose
its
funders
its
original
seed
money
reportedly
came
from
a
wealthy
iowa
ethanol
executive
and
it
has
received
significant
contributions
from
organizations
linked
to
petrochemical
billionaires
charles
and
david
koch
each
ad
is
a
second
radio
hit
purportedly
saying
thank
you
to
republican
senators
who
opposed
the
prescription
drug
pricing
reduction
act
pdpra
of
the
spots
thank
sens
mike
crapo
r-id
and
pat
toomey
r-pa
for
their
committee
votes
against
the
bill
they
praise
each
for
having
voted
to
protect
seniors
from
arbitrary
government
price
controls
on
medicare
part
d.
government
price
controls
would
slow
research
and
development
of
new
drugs
delaying
progress
on
cures
for
diseases
like
cancer
and
alzheimer's
and
making
them
more
expensive
the
narrator
claims
the
listeners
are
urged
to
call
their
senator
to
thank
them
for
defending
free-market
principles
and
to
urge
them
to
continue
to
oppose
socialist
price
controls
the
argument
it
would
appear
is
that
by
paying
less
money
to
drug
companies
the
drug
companies
will
have
less
money
to
research
new
medicines
taken
to
its
logical
extreme
if
the
government
offered
to
triple
what
it
pays
for
medications
drug
companies
would
develop
even
more
cures
the
bill
contains
a
variety
of
provisions
changing
the
way
medicare
and
medicaid
pay
for
prescription
drugs
grassley
has
promised
it
will
reduce
costs
by
billions
for
the
government
and
beneficiaries
of
medicare
and
medicaid
and
would
also
lower
prescription
drug
costs
for
people
covered
by
private
insurance
while
the
bill
has
earned
praise
from
consumer
groups
it
was
a
blow
to
the
pharmaceutical
industry
the
chairman's
mark
of
the
pdpra
backed
by
both
senate
finance
committee
chairman
grassley
and
his
ranking
democratic
member
sen
ron
wyden
of
oregon
was
passed
out
of
committee
on
an
to
vote
by
voting
no
crapo
and
toomey
won
not
just
the
gratitude
of
the
american
future
fund
whoever
they
are
but
radio
ads
suggesting
that
this
vote
makes
them
heroes
