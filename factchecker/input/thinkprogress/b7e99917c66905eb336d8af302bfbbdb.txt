saudi
arabia
will
allow
women
over
to
travel
without
permission
of
male
guardianship
the
cage
door
is
now
ajar
but
far
from
open
in
another
blow
to
its
guardianship
laws
a
series
of
royal
decrees
published
by
saudi
arabia's
state
media
on
friday
allow
women
and
older
to
get
a
passport
and
travel
without
permission
from
male
family
members
it's
unclear
if
any
hurdles
might
remain
in
place
preventing
women
from
traveling
for
instance
when
the
gulf
arab
kingdom
finally
allowed
women
to
drive
in
june
women
still
faced
significant
barriers
including
the
limited
number
of
schools
available
to
provide
women
with
required
instruction
only
other
females
are
allowed
to
teach
women
how
to
drive
and
the
cost
of
such
courses
which
have
proven
to
be
prohibitively
high
but
in
short
order
getting
a
passport
won't
be
an
issue
even
prior
to
this
decree
women
were
allowed
to
apply
for
visas
to
other
countries
without
the
permission
of
a
male
relative
friday's
new
decrees
also
give
women
more
rights
to
handle
administrative
family
matters
including
registering
the
births
of
their
children
marriage
and
the
right
to
seek
guardianship
of
minor
children
it
also
lifts
some
restrictions
currently
keeping
women
out
of
the
workforce
the
extent
to
which
these
new
decrees
will
be
implemented
and
enforced
remains
to
be
seen
as
saudi
arabia
which
lacks
a
codified
legal
code
largely
enforces
its
laws
in
an
informal
system
relying
on
police
and
sharia
islamic
law
court
interpretations
of
islamic
scripture
additionally
being
legally
permitted
to
do
something
and
actually
being
able
to
do
it
are
two
different
things
for
example
while
women
have
the
right
to
purchase
cars
in
many
cases
according
to
a
june
domestic
survey
some
still
say
they
don't
believe
they
have
the
legal
agency
to
do
so
for
those
who
are
not
the
primary
decision
maker
almost
half
indicated
their
husbands
will
be
making
the
decision
and
a
fourth
said
their
father-in-laws
have
the
final
say
in
the
matter
reported
the
saudi
gazette
at
the
time
women
will
still
need
male
permission
to
get
married
living
independently
in
a
rented
or
purchased
home
also
still
requires
the
permission
of
a
male
relative
saudi
arabia's
guardianship
laws
have
long
been
targeted
by
human
rights
groups
as
cruel
and
repressive
in
recent
years
young
women
in
increasing
numbers
have
sought
to
escape
the
repressive
kingdom
making
public
pleas
for
amnesty
in
countries
such
as
australia
and
the
united
kingdom
the
reputations
of
these
women
are
smeared
in
saudi
arabia
where
they
are
mocked
and
derided
with
all
kinds
of
false
claims
and
conspiracies
the
guardianship
laws
that
act
as
a
catalyst
for
these
desperate
and
dangerous
escapes
dominate
virtually
every
element
of
saudi
women's
lives
from
girlhood
to
grave
giving
male
relatives
full
control
over
their
personal
legal
and
financial
affairs
as
well
as
their
freedom
of
movement
and
association
it
makes
it
virtually
impossible
for
them
to
get
any
kind
of
legal
relief
in
situations
that
involve
sexual
assault
and
domestic
abuse
saudi
ruler
and
close
ally
of
the
trump
administration
crown
prince
mohamed
bin
salman
known
as
mbs
has
endeavored
to
promote
a
modern
progressive
image
of
his
country
touting
women
being
allowed
to
drive
and
permitting
the
screenings
of
american
films
inside
the
kingdom
but
some
of
the
key
activists
who
fought
for
women's
right
to
drive
remained
imprisoned
in
saudi
arabia
for
nearly
a
year
after
the
ban
was
lifted
with
reports
detailing
their
torture
circulating
as
recently
as
late
last
year
at
least
one
of
the
activists
loujain
al-hathlou
remains
imprisoned
the
effort
to
improve
saudi
arabia's
international
standing
has
also
taken
a
serious
hit
due
to
the
country's
ongoing
participation
in
yemen's
war
where
it
has
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
civilians
including
children
regularly
bombing
clinics
markets
and
at
least
one
school
bus
relentless
saudi-led
airstrikes
have
triggered
multiple
deadly
cholera
outbreaks
and
mass
child
malnourishment
pushing
the
country
to
the
brink
of
famine
the
saudis
have
also
been
accused
of
war
crimes
by
rights
groups
and
the
united
nations
is
currently
investigating
these
charges
meanwhile
the
murder
of
dissident
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
a
vocal
critic
of
mbs's
rule
has
further
damaged
the
crown
prince's
laboriously-crafted
image
despite
u.s.
and
international
intelligence
pointing
the
finger
of
blame
at
the
saudi
government
for
the
gruesome
october
killing
president
donald
trump
has
maintained
his
close
relationship
with
mbs
and
has
declined
to
blame
him
for
khashoggi's
murder
the
united
states
has
also
continued
to
provide
support
for
saudi
arabia
with
weapons
sales
over
congressional
objection
and
refueling
capabilities
