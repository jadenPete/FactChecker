gop
candidate
has
a
pretty
hypocritical
excuse
for
why
he's
down
in
the
polls
house
candidate
dan
bishop
r-nc
is
in
a
toss-up
race
in
a
district
president
donald
trump
won
by
points
dan
bishop
the
republican
nominee
in
next
week's
north
carolina
congressional
special
election
claimed
on
thursday
that
the
reason
polls
show
he
could
lose
a
district
that
president
donald
trump
won
easily
is
that
so
much
money
was
coming
in
from
out
of
district
to
support
his
democratic
opponent
but
most
of
the
money
going
to
support
bishop
also
comes
from
outside
of
north
carolina
voters
in
north
carolina's
th
congressional
district
will
vote
tuesday
in
their
latest
attempt
to
elect
a
u.s.
representative
the
midterm
election
result
was
thrown
out
due
to
election
fraud
by
the
then-republican
nominee's
campaign
and
the
seat
has
been
vacant
since
january
experts
say
the
race
is
a
toss-up
despite
the
district
being
one
trump
carried
by
points
in
on
thursday
bishop
went
on
fox
news
and
was
asked
about
a
new
bipartisan
poll
that
showed
him
trailing
democratic
nominee
dan
mccready
by
a
to
margin
my
opponent
has
been
running
for
months
he
answered
and
he
has
been
funded
by
million
tons
of
money
from
outside
the
district
a
lot
from
california
new
york
and
new
jersey
a
lot
of
it
from
hard-left
sources
but
most
of
the
money
in
support
of
bishop
in
the
race
has
also
come
from
outside
of
the
ninth
district
and
the
tar
heel
state
last
month
the
non-partisan
center
for
responsive
politics
reported
that
while
mccready
has
outraised
bishop
in
the
race
outside
spending
by
super
pacs
party
committees
and
dark
money
groups
has
significantly
favored
the
republican
nominee
the
report
noted
that
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
the
house
republicans
campaign
arm
had
already
spent
million
on
the
race
and
had
reportedly
reserved
a
total
of
million
in
air
time
for
commercials
two
conservative
super
pacs
the
congressional
leadership
fund
and
club
for
growth
action
have
also
thrown
their
support
behind
bishop
spending
a
combined
million
on
the
race
and
a
thinkprogress
review
of
bishop's
own
campaign
finance
filings
found
that
he
had
taken
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
from
out
of
state
republican
politicians
including
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
and
rep
doug
lamalfa
both
of
california
and
rep
lee
zeldin
of
new
york
bishop
was
asked
about
trump's
planned
campaign
visit
to
the
district
prior
to
tuesday's
special
election
and
whether
it
was
needed
for
him
to
win
absolutely
bishop
admitted
the
president
is
going
to
come
down
and
communicate
to
the
people
who
love
donald
trump
and
support
him
as
president
and
want
him
to
accomplish
the
things
he
set
out
to
do
they
need
to
hear
from
him
and
so
we're
delighted
he
is
coming
