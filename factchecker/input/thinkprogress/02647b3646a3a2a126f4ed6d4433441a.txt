trump
administration
to
weaken
protections
for
endangered
species
in
favor
of
fossil
fuels
before
joining
the
administration
interior
department
david
bernhardt
lobbied
against
the
endangered
species
act
the
trump
administration's
interior
department
announced
on
monday
its
official
proposal
to
significantly
weaken
the
nation's
endangered
species
act
the
move
would
make
it
easier
for
new
mining
oil
and
gas
development
to
take
place
in
areas
critical
to
protected
species
the
widely
popular
conservation
law
passed
in
has
been
heralded
worldwide
for
its
success
it
is
credited
with
saving
iconic
american
species
such
as
the
bald
eagle
and
grizzly
bear
from
extinction
under
the
interior
department's
proposed
revisions
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
apply
considerations
regarding
the
impact
of
climate
change
on
wildlife
in
deciding
whether
a
species
should
be
protected
critical
habitats
would
also
likely
shrink
as
the
rule
change
paves
the
way
for
fossil
fuel
extraction
in
areas
critical
to
protected
species
and
in
a
first
economic
factors
will
be
allowed
to
be
taken
into
account
when
deciding
whether
new
animals
should
be
added
to
the
list
of
protected
species
the
proposal
comes
after
two
years
of
work
to
narrow
the
law
last
year
interior
secretary
david
bernhardt
wrote
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
that
the
endangered
species
act
places
an
unnecessary
regulatory
burden
on
companies
bernhardt
however
has
a
history
of
lobbying
against
the
law
prior
to
joining
interior
he
ran
the
natural
resources
department
at
lobbying
and
law
firm
brownstein
hyatt
farber
schreck
during
his
time
there
he
worked
on
behalf
of
oil
and
gas
companies
as
well
as
large
agribusinesses
to
weaken
environmental
protections
bernhardt
also
lobbied
on
behalf
of
westlands
water
district
and
agricultural
interests
against
the
endangered
species
act
and
during
his
time
at
the
interior
bernhardt
intervened
to
block
a
study
showing
pesticides
might
threaten
the
existence
of
endangered
species
according
to
documents
recently
revealed
by
the
new
york
times
fossil
fuel
companies
have
also
continued
to
lobby
against
endangered
species
protections
over
the
course
of
the
trump
administration
for
instance
in
may
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
announced
a
proposal
to
downgrade
the
status
of
the
american
burying
beetle
an
insect
threatened
by
climate
change
from
endangered
to
threatened
this
was
the
result
of
oil
and
gas
lobbying
and
would
make
it
easier
for
companies
to
build
pipelines
and
two
months
before
that
in
march
the
interior
department
announced
a
sweeping
set
of
revisions
to
obama-era
sage
grouse
proposed
protections
the
trump
administration's
planned
changes
include
removing
restrictions
for
new
oil
gas
and
mining
development
on
millions
of
acres
of
sage
grouse
habitat
across
the
west
in
october
a
proposed
mining
moratorium
on
million
acres
of
crucial
sage
grouse
habitat
was
also
canceled
this
was
swiftly
followed
by
a
decision
from
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
december
ending
directives
stating
oil
and
gas
leases
should
be
prioritized
for
outside
of
sage
grouse
habitat
one
of
the
most
controversial
changes
among
the
proposed
revisions
released
monday
is
the
fact
that
economics
will
be
a
consideration
in
whether
or
not
a
species
should
be
protected
currently
the
decision
to
add
or
remove
a
species
is
designed
to
be
based
purely
on
science
there
can
be
economic
costs
to
protecting
endangered
species
drew
caputo
vice
president
of
litigation
for
lands
wildlife
and
oceans
at
earthjustice
an
environmental
law
organization
told
the
new
york
times
but
he
added
if
we
make
decisions
based
on
short-term
economic
costs
we're
going
to
have
a
whole
lot
more
extinct
species
