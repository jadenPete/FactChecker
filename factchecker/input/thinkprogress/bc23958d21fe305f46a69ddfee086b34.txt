new

vincent
d'egidio
said
at
the
time
with
the
hate
crimes
and
everything
else
going
on
we
wanted
to
make
sure
we
do
our
part
to
make
sure
this

very
quickly
in

the
charges
on
thursday
justin
herdman
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
used
the
opportunity
to
deliver
a
stinging
rebuke
of
the
white
nationalist
ideology
to
which
reardon
and
others
subscribe
now
let
me
speak
generally
to
those
who
are
advocates
for
white
supremacy
or
white
nationalism
i
am
talking
directly
to
you
herdman
said
the
constitution
protects
your
right
to
speak
your
right
to
think
and
your
right
to
believe
if
you
want
to
waste
the
blessings
of
liberty
by
going
down
a
path
of
hatred
and
failed
ideologies
that
is
your
choice
your
right
to
free
speech
does
not
automatically
mean
that
people
will
agree
with
you
in
fact
you
have
a
god-given
and
inalienable
right
to
be
on
the
losing
end
of
this
argument
he
continued
what
you
don't
have
though
is
the
right
to
take
out
your
frustration
and
failure
in
the
political
arena
by
resorting
to
violence
you
don't
have
any
right
to
threaten
the
lives
and
well-being
of
our
neighbors
threatening
to
kill
jewish
people
gunning
down
innocent
latinos
on
a
weekend
shopping
trip
planning
and
plotting
to
perpetrate
murders
in
the
name
of
a
nonsense
racial
theory
sitting
to
pray
with
god-fearing
people
who
you
execute
moments
later
those
actions
don't
make
you
soldiers
they
make
you
cowards
law
enforcement
does
not
go
to
war
with
cowards
who
break
the
law
we
arrest
them
and
send
them
to
prison
on
the
same
day
as
herdman
made
his
statement
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
in
ohio
also
announced
guilty
pleas
for
a
pair
who
had
plotted
to
carry
out
a
mass
shooting
at
a
bar
in
toledo
elizabeth
lecron
and
co-conspirator
vincent
armstrong
had
for
almost
a
year
plotted
to
use
guns
and
improvised
explosives
to
carry
out
an
attack
the
two
reportedly
were
obsessed
with
the
columbine
shooters
as
well
as
the
white
supremacist
mass
murderer
dylann
roof
who
slaughtered
nine
people
in
a
predominantly
black
church
in
charleston
south
carolina
in
in
the
wake
of
the
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
earlier
this
month
fbi
director
christopher
wray
ordered
the
agency
to
conduct
its
own
threat
assessments
to
help
local
law
enforcement
identify
potential
mass
shooters
and
prevent
similar
kinds
of
attacks
by
far-right
extremists
at
least
a
dozen
people
have
been
arrested
over
the
last
month
for
making
