trump-supporting
equinox
owner
wants
to
have
it
both
ways
stephen
ross
pays
lip
service
to
social
justice
but
his
fundraising
supports
trump's
hate-mongering
plutocrat
sports
franchise
owner
and
exercise
chain
investor
stephen
ross
is
offering
americans
their
latest
reminder
that
the
nation's
ownership
class
cares
more
about
their
money
than
their
morals
ross
is
under
fire
for
his
decision
to
continue
raising
money
for
president
donald
trump's
reelection
campaign
members
of
the
gyms
he
owns
are
planning
boycotts
at
least
one
star
player
for
his
miami
dolphins
is
airing
him
out
publicly
for
hypocrisy
all
the
while
ross
has
maintained
he
is
deeply
committed
to
social
justice
values
i
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
an
outspoken
champion
of
racial
equality
inclusion
and
diversity
ross
said
in
a
statement
to
the
cbs
affiliate
in
miami
i
have
known
donald
trump
for
years
and
while
we
agree
on
some
issues
we
strongly
disagree
on
many
others
and
i
have
never
been
bashful
about
expressing
my
opinions
ross's
net
worth
is
well
north
of
billion
according
to
published
estimates
besides
the
nfl
franchise
and
controlling
stakes
in
both
kanye
west's
beloved
equinox
gym
franchise
and
the
trendy
high-end
soulcycle
chain
ross
also
holds
several
million
dollars
of
trump's
corporate
debts
his
firm
also
played
a
signal
role
in
developing
the
hudson
yards
project
in
new
york
city
which
infamously
preyed
upon
an
urban-renewal
development
program
that
was
supposed
to
shovel
money
into
refurbishing
long-neglected
neighborhoods
ross
financial
backing
of
trump's
electoral
ambitions
did
not
pose
a
major
threat
to
his
business
interests
until
this
week
however
despite
the
president's
irresponsible
and
inciting
rhetorical
attacks
on
immigrants
democratic
party
leaders
from
high-poverty
districts
and
other
perceived
political
enemies
ross
has
seen
fit
to
stick
by
a
man
obviously
opposed
to
the
inclusive
and
diverse
values
the
billionaire
claims
to
hold
the
dam
broke
this
week
after
a
man
with
an
assault
rifle
killed
people
and
grievously
injured
dozens
more
at
an
el
paso
walmart
the
suspect
who
has
confessed
wrote
before
the
attack
that
he
believed
like
the
president
that
an
invasion
of
latinx
migrants
is
ruining
the
country
on
wednesday
miami
dolphins
wide
receiver
kenny
stills
blasted
his
boss's
decision
to
hold
a
trump
fundraiser
you
can't
have
a
non
profit
with
this
mission
statement
then
open
your
doors
to
trump
stills
tweeted
linking
to
the
website
for
the
ross
initiative
in
sports
for
equality
days
later
members
of
ross
celebrity-laden
west
hollywood
equinox
facility
announced
a
formal
boycott
effort
ahead
of
the
friday
fundraiser
at
his
mansion
in
the
hamptons
ross
belief
that
he
can
simultaneously
support
and
befriend
a
man
like
trump
and
count
himself
a
crusader
for
social
equality
is
nothing
particularly
new
hyper-wealthy
people
have
always
tried
to
have
it
both
ways
on
this
stuff
their
interest
in
favorable
tax
treatment
and
lucrative
development
opportunities
subsidized
by
taxpayers
has
traditionally
meant
that
rich
people
who
disdain
the
retrograde
aspects
of
republican
party
cultural
doctrine
nonetheless
write
checks
to
the
gop
there
are
outliers
from
this
pattern
of
placing
financial
self-interest
over
the
wider
social
welfare
however
a
group
called
patriotic
millionaires
recently
barnstormed
the
country
demanding
progressive
income
and
investment
tax
policies
that
would
hurt
their
bottom
lines
but
furnish
new
resources
to
help
less-fortunate
citizens
the
sort
of
intellectual
consistency
some
of
ross
customers
and
employees
are
demanding
of
him
by
protesting
his
allegiance
to
trump
is
not
hard
to
achieve
it's
a
simple
matter
of
will
and
of
philosophy
but
ross
is
deeply
entrenched
in
the
same
sub-category
of
richness
from
which
trump
springs
as
the
hudson
yards
boondoggle
illustrates
large-scale
developers
tend
to
be
a
different
breed
from
the
sort
of
people
who've
joined
the
patriotic
millionaires
brigade
their
taxpayer-assisted
projects
shift
not
just
wealth
but
public
space
from
those
who
have
little
to
those
who
are
already
quite
comfortable
people
who
enrich
themselves
by
making
those
sorts
of
deals
can
open
all
the
nonprofit
social-good
organizations
they
want
but
their
core
economic
activity
and
the
displacement
and
inequality
that
activity
promotes
suggests
that
organizations
like
rise
are
little
more
than
a
way
of
soothing
guilty
consciences
