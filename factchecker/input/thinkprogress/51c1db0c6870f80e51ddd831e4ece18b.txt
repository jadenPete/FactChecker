the
single
most
ludicrous
thing
trump
just
said
about
guns
guns
kill
people
period
president
trump
delivered
a
short
speech
on
monday
in
which
he
blamed
the
internet
video
games
mental
illness
and
the
fact
that
the
state
does
not
execute
enough
people
for
the
two
mass
shootings
that
killed
more
than
two
dozen
people
this
weekend
the
one
thing
trump
refused
to
blame
was
the
actual
weapons
used
to
murder
these
individuals
mental
illness
and
hatred
pulls
the
trigger
trump
said
not
the
gun
it's
a
new
spin
on
an
old
anti-gun
control
slogan
guns
don't
kill
people
people
do
but
it's
just
wrong
every
nation
has
people
with
mental
illnesses
every
one
of
our
peer
nations
have
video
games
and
access
to
the
internet
what
sets
the
united
states
apart
from
countries
that
do
not
have
the
same
epidemic
of
gun
violence
is
guns
plain
and
simple
this
close
correlation
between
the
number
of
guns
and
the
rate
of
gun
violence
also
exists
within
the
united
states
as
the
percentage
of
gun-owning
households
within
a
state
increases
the
number
of
gun
deaths
also
tends
to
rise
similarly
a
report
by
the
center
for
american
progress
found
that
the
states
with
the
weakest
gun
laws
collectively
have
a
level
of
gun
violence
that
is
more
than
twice
as
high
percent
higher
than
the
states
with
the
strongest
gun
laws
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
newsroom
housed
at
the
center
for
american
progress
action
fund
simply
put
guns
kill
people
the
way
to
prevent
gun
violence
is
to
get
rid
of
guns
