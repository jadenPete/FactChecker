after
months
without
pay
jamaican
women's
soccer
team
goes
on
strike
we're
sick
of
being
taking
advantage
of
this
summer
the
reggae
girlz
of
jamaica
made
history
when
they
became
the
first
caribbean
team
to
play
in
the
women's
word
cup
though
they
failed
to
win
a
match
in
france
it
still
felt
like
women's
football
in
jamaica
was
on
the
way
up
but
less
than
three
months
later
that
progress
is
in
jeopardy
because
the
jamaican
football
federation
has
not
paid
the
reggae
girlz
any
of
the
money
it
has
been
contractually
obligated
to
pay
them
since
january
on
monday
the
players
launched
a
no
pay
no
play
campaign
on
social
media
and
announced
that
until
the
jff
pays
them
all
of
the
money
they
are
owed
the
women
will
not
be
attending
any
training
camps
or
competing
in
any
events
including
a
crucial
olympic
qualifying
tournament
at
the
end
of
this
month
we're
willing
to
sacrifice
that
because
enough
is
enough
nicole
mcclure
a
goalkeeper
on
the
team
told
thinkprogress
in
a
phone
call
on
monday
night
the
culture
of
this
organization
has
been
corrupt
for
years
now
we're
sick
of
being
taking
advantage
of
in
may
the
reggae
girlz
excluding
those
who
wanted
to
retain
their
ncaa
eligibility
by
adhering
to
the
standards
of
amateurism
signed
a
contract
with
the
jff
according
to
mcclure
the
contract
included
backpay
dating
back
to
january
and
lasted
until
august
the
payments
were
due
on
the
th
of
each
month
at
the
very
end
of
august
right
before
the
contract
expired
the
jff
said
it
was
wiring
of
the
money
it
owed
to
the
players
even
if
the
promised
hits
their
bank
accounts
this
week
players
say
it's
not
enough
to
stop
the
boycott
it's
a
slap
in
the
face
it's
hush-hush
money
mcclure
said
it's
just
really
disheartening
it's
messed
up
because
we
were
legally
promised
this
there's
no
way
to
go
around
it
the
players
got
most
of
the
per-day
stipends
they
were
owed
during
the
duration
of
the
world
cup
in
france
but
that
money
was
just
to
get
them
through
the
tournament
the
monthly
salaries
were
supposed
to
allow
the
players
to
live
as
professionals
and
perhaps
give
them
more
time
to
train
and
practice
in
lieu
of
taking
on
second
and
third
jobs
for
me
personally
i
don't
get
paid
for
my
club
team
mcclure
said
i
was
banking
on
the
monthly
stipend
women
footballers
don't
get
paid
nearly
enough
to
survive
on
their
own
on
average
we
don't
get
paid
nearly
as
much
as
the
last
person
on
the
men's
team
the
jff
reportedly
told
the
players
that
it
hasn't
paid
them
because
it
hasn't
yet
received
the
women's
world
cup
prize
money
from
fifa
the
international
governing
body
of
football
however
mcclure
said
that
the
contract
did
not
tie
monthly
payments
to
fifa
prize
money
in
any
way
fifa
should
be
paying
attention
to
this
dispute
however
fifa
announced
it
will
expand
the
field
from
teams
to
teams
at
the
women's
world
cup
and
increase
the
prize
money
but
right
now
fifa
does
a
horrible
job
holding
federations
accountable
for
treating
women's
football
programs
properly
in
terms
of
development
resources
and
payment
the
reggae
girlz
are
a
prime
example
of
this
in
after
the
team
failed
to
qualify
for
the
beijing
olympics
the
jff
disbanded
the
team
it
wasn't
fully
brought
back
to
life
until
when
cedella
marley
the
daughter
of
jamaican
music
legend
bob
marley
became
a
benefactor
for
the
team
and
helped
it
find
sponsors
and
partners
but
even
then
the
players
and
their
families
had
to
do
a
lot
of
personal
fundraising
in
order
to
just
make
the
trip
to
france
happen
they
said
it
was
worth
it
because
they
felt
they
were
building
something
that
future
jamaican
women
could
benefit
from
and
winning
institutional
support
along
the
way
but
those
at
the
top
aren't
keeping
up
with
their
end
of
the
bargain
we
created
history
paved
the
path
for
future
generations
without
the
jff's
support
mcclure
said
it's
as
if
everything
that
we
have
done
means
absolutely
nothing
to
them
