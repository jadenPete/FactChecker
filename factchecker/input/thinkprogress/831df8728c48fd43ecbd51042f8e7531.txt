brings
attention
to
death
of
trans
woman
at
rikers
calling
solitary
inhumane
her
campaign
is
drawing
renewed
attention
to
her
death
to
demand
better
from
the
justice
system
presidential
hopeful
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
shared
a
story
on
thursday
about
layleen
cubilette-polanco
an
afro-latinx
trans
woman
who
died
at
rikers
island
in
new
york
city
in
june
coupling
it
with
a
call
for
sweeping
reforms
to
the
criminal
justice
system
her
interest
in
the
tragic
story
may
signal
to
advocates
for
lgbtq
equality
that
she
is
committed
to
acknowledging
the
effects
of
the
criminal
justice
system
on
trans
people's
lives
warren
tweeted
on
thursday
let's
be
clear
layleen
cubilette-polanco
should
still
be
alive
solitary
confinement
is
cruel
and
inhumane
we
must
end
this
practice
enforce
strict
standards
for
medical
care
and
provide
extra
layers
of
protection
for
lgbtq
people
cubilette-polanco
was
arrested
in
april
on
misdemeanor
assault
charges
and
bail
was
set
at
a
judge
ordered
her
release
on
those
charges
but
she
was
still
being
held
for
low-level
drug
charges
and
prostitution
charges
from
two
years
prior
she
was
placed
in
a
unit
for
trans
women
where
she
was
involved
in
a
fight
and
subsequently
relocated
to
a
restrictive
housing
unit
which
many
have
referred
to
as
solitary
confinement
her
family
said
she
could
not
afford
to
pay
bail
she
died
at
rikers
as
a
result
of
a
medical
condition
that
causes
seizures
according
to
chief
medical
examiner
the
city
of
new
york
dr
barbara
sampson
shortly
after
her
death
people
gathered
in
foley
square
in
new
york
chanting
black
trans
lives
matter
tina
luongo
the
attorney-in-charge
of
the
criminal
defense
practice
at
the
legal
aid
society
released
a
statement
to
media
this
week
following
the
official
news
of
cubilette-polanco's
cause
of
death
layleen
polanco's
death
is
an
absolute
tragedy
and
her
passing
further
underscores
the
dangers
of
solitary
confinement
which
isolates
already
medically
fragile
people
from
observation
and
care
said
luongo
we
demand
utmost
transparency
and
rigor
in
the
investigation
of
the
correctional
and
medical
policies
and
decisions
surrounding
her
treatment
and
her
placement
in
isolation
lawyers
from
david
b.
shaines
law
office
who
represent
her
family
have
said
that
cubilette-polanco
experienced
multiple
seizures
at
rikers
and
that
the
department
of
corrections
knew
about
her
epilepsy
they
say
she
should
have
never
placed
in
punitive
segregation
and
that
it
became
her
death
warrant
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
staff
have
not
handled
conflict
within
the
trans
women's
unit
well
which
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
she
was
placed
in
the
restrictive
housing
unit
to
begin
with
a
new
york
city
board
of
corrections
report
assessing
its
transgender
housing
unit
determined
that
there
is
no
effective
mechanism
to
address
conflict
between
people
in
the
unit
there
were
many
other
criticisms
of
the
unit
including
poor
training
of
staff
on
how
to
serve
transgender
people
in
the
unit
cubilette-polanco's
treatment
by
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
case
study
in
how
it
disproportionately
and
negatively
impacts
many
vulnerable
populations
trans
women
people
of
color
and
low-income
people
and
their
families
who
can't
afford
bail
by
tweeting
about
her
story
and
potential
reforms
warren
is
bringing
attention
to
those
criticisms
but
she
is
also
notably
filling
in
the
gaps
of
some
of
her
own
proposed
policies
to
improve
the
well-being
of
lgbtq
people
in
may
newnownext
reported
on
warren's
proposals
and
policies
designed
to
advance
lgbtq
rights
that
included
reversing
donald
trump's
military
trans
ban
a
vow
to
protect
civil
rights
for
transgender
people
outlawing
conversion
therapy
reversing
the
state
department's
denial
of
family
visas
to
same-sex
domestic
partners
of
diplomats
and
ending
discrimination
against
queer
men
who
are
currently
barred
from
donating
blood
she
also
said
she
supports
the
equality
act
which
would
amend
the
civil
rights
act
of
to
ban
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
identity
and
sexual
orientation
in
housing
employment
education
federal
programs
jury
service
public
accommodations
and
credit
and
lending
warren
added
that
she'd
implement
the
refund
equality
act
she
co-sponsored
in
which
would
mean
that
same-sex
couples
married
in
states
before
the
u.s.
supreme
court
ruled
in
favor
of
marriage
equality
could
amend
amend
past
tax
returns
which
would
allow
them
to
get
irs
refunds
although
warren
acknowledged
many
important
barriers
for
lgbtq
people
one
of
the
holes
in
her
plan
for
lgbtq
equality
was
in
the
criminal
justice
system
chase
strangio
a
staff
attorney
with
the
aclu's
lgbt
hiv
project
asked
how
she
would
acknowledge
the
struggles
of
trans
people
of
color
what
about
prisons
sex
work
he
asked
although
we
don't
know
all
of
the
circumstances
of
cubilette-polanco's
life
her
experience
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
protracted
stay
and
eventual
segregation
within
rikers
was
likely
compounded
for
many
reasons
she
was
poor
and
couldn't
afford
bail
she
felt
the
effects
of
the
criminalization
of
sex
work
sex
workers
are
currently
fighting
for
decriminalization
and
one
of
their
chief
arguments
is
that
it
will
make
sex
workers
and
those
whom
police
profile
as
sex
workers
who
are
often
trans
women
of
color
much
safer
as
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
explained
in
a
report
on
sex
work
warren
has
not
fully
answered
strangio's
question
about
policies
supporting
trans
people
of
color
but
her
focus
on
cubilette-polanco's
story
is
another
example
of
her
taking
steps
to
show
her
support
of
trans
people
particularly
some
of
the
most
marginalized
in
the
trans
community
in
january
for
instance
thinkprogress
pressed
warren
on
her
remark
that
transition-related
surgeries
for
incarcerated
trans
people
was
not
a
good
use
of
taxpayer
dollars
warren's
presidential
exploratory
committee
said
in
a
statement
senator
warren
supports
access
to
medically
necessary
services
including
transition-related
surgeries
claimed
an
unnamed
spokesperson
for
her
exploratory
committee
this
includes
procedures
taking
place
at
the
va
in
the
military
or
at
correctional
facilities
in
another
show
of
support
for
transgender
and
nonbinary
americans
warren
recently
updated
her
twitter
bio
to
include
her
pronouns
and
at
the
iowa
city
presidential
debate
staffers
nametags
included
pronouns
for
their
gender
during
the
previous
presidential
debate
held
in
june
she
used
the
word
latinx
instead
of
latino
to
be
inclusive
of
all
genders
those
may
seem
like
small
gestures
but
they
nevertheless
show
her
support
of
transgender
and
nonbinary
people
i
think
of
it
this
way
who
is
this
economy
really
working
for
it's
doing
great
for
a
thinner
and
thinner
slice
at
the
top
it's
doing
great
for
people
who
want
to
invest
in
private
prisons
but
not
for
the
african
americans
and
latinx
who
are
torn
apart
and
whose
lives
are
destroyed
she
said
