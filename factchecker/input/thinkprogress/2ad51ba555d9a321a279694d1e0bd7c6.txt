one
of
the
world's
largest
banks
thinks
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
for
the
oil
industry
we
think
the
economics
of
renewables
are
impossible
for
oil
to
compete
with
plunging
prices
for
batteries
and
renewables
are
driving
an
electric
vehicle
ev
revolution
so
rapidly
that
the
economics
of
oil
are
now
in
relentless
and
irreversible
decline
that's
the
startling
conclusion
of
a
detailed
new
analysis
for
professional
investors
of
the
economics
of
evs
versus
gasoline
cars
produced
by
bnp
paribas
the
world's
eighth
largest
bank
by
total
assets
the
report
is
good
news
for
humanity
because
it
means
peak
oil
demand
may
be
less
than
a
decade
away
which
in
turn
means
ambitious
climate
goals
will
be
more
affordable
than
previously
thought
but
the
bank's
analysis
wells
wires
and
wheels
is
devastating
for
big
oil
it
concludes
that
the
oil
industry
has
never
before
in
its
history
faced
the
kind
of
threat
that
renewable
electricity
in
tandem
with
evs
poses
to
its
business
model
within
a
few
years
electric
vehicles
evs
will
be
superior
to
gasoline
powered
cars
in
every
respect
in
part
that's
because
electric
motors
are
vastly
more
efficient
than
gasoline
engines
and
it's
also
in
part
because
solar
and
wind
power
and
batteries
have
seen
staggering
price
drops
in
the
past
decade
and
are
projected
to
see
equally
big
drops
in
the
coming
years
but
one
of
the
most
startling
findings
is
that
because
the
cost
of
running
evs
on
solar
or
wind
power
is
dropping
so
rapidly
the
only
way
gasoline
cars
can
compete
with
these
renewable
energy-powered
evs
in
the
s
is
if
the
price
of
oil
were
to
drop
to
to
per
barrel
the
current
price
of
oil
is
over
even
worse
for
oil
this
economic
analysis
doesn't
even
factor
in
many
of
the
other
benefits
of
running
cars
on
renewable
power
rather
than
oil
these
include
the
vast
public
health
benefits
of
not
breathing
air
pollution
from
burning
oil
along
with
the
benefits
of
not
having
huge
oil
spills
and
of
not
destroying
a
livable
climate
the
report
is
written
by
mark
lewis
global
head
of
sustainability
research
at
the
bank
lewis
formerly
worked
as
head
of
european
utilities
research
at
barclays
and
as
global
head
of
energy
research
at
deutsche
bank
lewis
notes
that
many
independent
analyses
including
bloomberg
new
energy
finance
and
the
risk
management
firm
dnv
gl
have
concluded
that
in
the
timeframe
the
total
lifecycle
cost
of
owning
an
ev
will
be
cheaper
than
that
of
owning
a
gasoline-fueled
car
the
report
also
looks
at
the
lifecycle
costs
of
oil
drilling
production
and
transportation
versus
the
life-cycle
cost
of
renewable
power
plants
building
and
operating
we
think
the
economics
of
renewables
are
impossible
for
oil
to
compete
with
when
looked
at
over
the
cycle
the
study
concludes
if
the
future
is
so
bad
for
oil
then
why
hasn't
there
been
a
crash
in
either
the
price
of
petroleum
or
the
stock
prices
of
major
oil
companies
there
is
a
catch
and
it
is
a
big
one
explains
the
report
oil
has
a
massive
incumbency
advantage
right
now
oil
is
benefiting
from
the
fact
that
its
entire
production
and
delivery
system
was
built
over
decades
and
that
investment
gives
oil
a
big
short-term
advantage
over
evs
which
have
yet
to
build-out
their
fueling
infrastructure
globally
the
clear
conclusion
of
our
analysis
is
that
if
we
were
building
out
the
global
energy
system
from
scratch
today
lewis
explains
economics
alone
would
dictate
that
at
a
minimum
the
road-transportation
infrastructure
would
be
built
up
around
evs
powered
by
wind-
and
solar-generated
electricity
but
oil
has
a
big
head
start
and
of
course
big
oil
uses
its
vast
current
income
to
buy
political
power
so
that
it
can
slow
down
investment
and
government
policies
aimed
at
advancing
electric
cars
lewis
however
argues
that
from
a
policy
perspective
governments
need
to
start
making
much
bigger
investments
in
electric
cars
and
their
fueling
infrastructure
simply
because
the
economics
are
becoming
so
good
for
evs
and
the
public
health
and
climate
benefits
are
so
huge
since
bnp
paribas
is
a
big
bank
and
the
report
is
for
investors
though
a
key
point
of
the
analysis
is
that
oil
companies
are
investing
staggering
amounts
of
money
in
finding
and
producing
new
wells
and
most
of
them
are
going
to
lose
a
lot
of
that
money
by
the
late
s
lewis
explains
a
significant
fraction
of
the
oil
produced
today
might
only
be
competitive
at
a
price
below
oil
companies
full
cost
of
production
even
worse
this
fraction
will
rise
over
the
lifetime
of
these
projects
as
the
penetration
rate
of
evs
increases
if
you
can't
produce
oil
profitably
at
under
or
a
barrel
your
oil
company
is
in
big
trouble
from
a
broader
perspective
lewis
warns
that
all
this
money
currently
being
spent
on
finding
and
producing
new
oil
is
a
huge
waste
an
opportunity
cost
to
society
as
a
whole
exactly
how
big
a
cost
bnp
paribas
calculates
the
size
of
that
opportunity
cost
is
trillion
over
the
next
years
on
gasoline
alone
and
that's
without
counting
the
cost
of
saving
a
livable
climate
it's
time
for
investors
and
governments
to
walk
away
from
big
oil
before
the
crash
and
before
it's
simply
too
late
to
save
our
children
and
future
generations
from
catastrophe
