tucker
carlson
latest
fox
news
host
to
take
pre-planned
vacation
amidst
controversy
after
calling
white
supremacy
a
hoax
he's
following
a
not-so-proud
tradition
at
the
network
fox
news
tucker
carlson
is
about
to
take
a
vacation
that
just
so
happens
to
follow
his
bizarre
rant
tuesday
night
claiming
that
white
supremacism
is
actually
not
a
real
problem
in
america
calling
it
instead
a
hoax
besides
being
false
the
rant
completely
ignored
both
the
el
paso
shooter's
manifesto
as
well
as
carlson's
own
penchant
for
extremely
racist
and
xenophobic
rhetoric
carlson
will
now
follow
the
storied
tradition
of
fox
hosts
suddenly
disappearing
for
a
while
after
getting
themselves
in
trouble
carlson
was
still
on
the
air
wednesday
night
though
and
he
chose
to
double
down
people
claiming
trump
is
a
white
supremacist
he
said
are
doing
so
for
political
reasons
to
distract
people
from
discussing
class
divisions
all
of
this
is
just
to
whip
up
a
frenzy
he
claimed
calling
criticism
of
white
supremacy
the
path
to
civil
war
obviously
clearly
on
the
defensive
he
urged
people
to
calm
down
but
with
that
he's
now
off
on
a
previously
unannounced
vacation
cnn's
oliver
darcy
checked
in
with
fox
news
and
learned
that
the
vacation
had
supposedly
been
in
the
works
before
his
controversial
comments
and
that
carlson
will
be
back
on
the
air
monday
august
th
similar
comments
were
made
however
when
other
fox
hosts
took
the
same
kinds
of
vacations
for
example
laura
ingraham
took
a
sudden
vacation
last
year
after
mocking
parkland
shooting
survivor
david
hogg
for
not
getting
into
some
colleges
hogg
countered
by
targeting
ingraham's
sponsors
and
suddenly
she
was
taking
a
pre-planned
vacation
back
in
sean
hannity
was
also
bleeding
advertisers
for
his
insistence
on
promoting
the
seth
rich
conspiracy
which
fox
news
has
still
not
apologized
for
elevating
the
network
claimed
hannity
was
simply
observing
memorial
day
weekend
insisting
that
all
those
who
believe
he
won't
soon
be
back
on
the
air
are
going
to
look
foolish
the
one
host
however
who
never
came
back
from
his
pre-planned
vacation
was
bill
o'reilly
he
was
also
hemorrhaging
advertisers
after
it
came
to
light
he'd
settled
sexual
harassment
allegations
with
five
different
women
to
the
tune
of
million
his
absence
did
not
help
end
the
scrutiny
of
his
advertisers
and
a
week
into
that
vacation
fox
news
fired
him
so
far
the
network
has
been
silent
about
carlson's
latest
gaslighting
on
white
supremacy
darcy
tried
to
reach
out
to
members
of
the
fox
news
board
but
none
would
comment
if
past
is
precedent
carlson's
fate
could
be
shaped
by
whether
or
not
criticism
dies
down
while
he's
away
reportedly
he'll
still
be
on
the
air
friday
night
for
a
special
investigation
so
he
won't
be
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
as
quickly
as
might
be
desired
indeed
the
extra
appearance
might
add
more
fuel
to
the
hashtag
firetuckercarlson
which
is
already
trending
on
twitter
