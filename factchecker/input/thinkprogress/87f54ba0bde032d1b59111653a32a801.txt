running
for

in
may
finally
be
thinning

john

a
video
that
he

a
run
for
u.s.
senate
back
in
his
home
state
against
republican
eric
gardner
who
is
running
for
re-election
some
serious
thought
now
today
i
am
ending
my
campaign
for
president
but
i
will
never
stop
believing
that
america
can
only
move
forward
when
we
work
together
hickenlooper
said
i
know
that
when
people
work
hard
enough
get
past
their
differences
you
can
make
amazing
progress
that's
what
we
did
in
colorado
and
i'm
so
proud
to
travel
around
the
country
and
tell
people
that
change
is
possible
when
you
work
together
hickenlooper
is
the
third
presidential
candidate
to
drop
out
of
the
race
over
the
past
two
months
joining
former
former
u.s.
sen
mike
gravel
alaska
and
u.s.
rep
eric
swalwell
ca
he
launched
his
campaign
in
march
promising
to
rely
on
years
of
experience
as
governor
and
former
mayor
of
denver
to
run
the
country
and
vowing
to
stand
up
to
president
donald
trump
whom
he
called
a
bully
hickenlooper
tried
to
connect
with
americans
by
mentioning
his
career
as
a
laid-off
geologist
and
the
owner
of
a
brew
pub
but
he
never
was
able
to
make
a
dent
in
the
national
polls
or
garner
the
attention
needed
to
win
the
presidency
in
a
robust
and
competitive
field
of
contenders
he
said
he
is
now
considering
a
senate
run
although
he
once
said
he
felt
he
was
not
cut
out
to
be
a
legislator
having
served
mostly
in
executive
functions
hickenlooper
had
a
fair
share
of
successes
as
colorado's
governor
from
to
he
worked
with
republicans
to
expand
medicaid
and
passed
methane
gas
regulations
he
also
helped
pass
gun
control
laws
in
the
state
following
the
mass
shooting
at
the
movie
theater
in
aurora
including
universal
background
checks
for
gun
sales
and
banning
magazines
that
hold
over
rounds
of
ammunition
he
referred
to
those
legislative
successes
and
the
state's
dramatic
job
growth
that
occurred
under
his
watch
in
his
video
announcing
the
end
of
his
candidacy
voters
he
spoke
with
on
the
campaign
want
solutions
they
want
this
country
moving
forward
they
are
sick
of
the
chaos
and
disfunction
of
washington
d.c.
and
i
couldn't
agree
with
them
more
hickenlooper
said
i
ran
for
president
because
this
country
is
being
ripped
apart
by
politics
and
partisan
games
while
our
biggest
problems
go
unsolved
with
hickenlooper
gone
there
are
still
democratic
candidates
running
for
president
there
has
been
increasing
pressure
on
other
low-polling
candidates
including
former
texas
congressman
beto
o'rourke
to
drop
out
and
run
for
senate
in
their
hometown
states
where
they
have
a
shot
at
flipping
critical
republican
seats
o'rourke
became
a
national
celebrity
after
narrowly
losing
to
republican
ted
cruz
in
texas
u.s.
senate
race
last
november
he
recently
regained
momentum
and
relaunched
his
campaign
after
being
praised
for
galvanizing
residents
in
his
hometown
el
paso
texas
following
this
month's
mass
shooting
carried
out
by
a
white
supremacist
that
killed
people
as
it
loses
contenders
the
democratic
field
also
has
gained
one
or
two
two-term
former
rep
joe
sestak
pa
joined
the
race
in
mid-june
and
tom
steyer
a
billionaire
democratic
donor
announced
his
run
for
president
in
july
pledging
million
from
his
own
coffers
to
support
his
campaign
despite
the
late
start
to
his
campaign
steyer
is
close
to
qualifying
for
a
spot
at
september's
democratic
presidential
debate
steyer
is
a
former

stacey
abrams
the
former
georgia
state
representative
who
narrowly
lost
to
republican
brian
kemp
in
the
race
for
governor
thanks
to
blatant
voter
suppression
tactics
announced
on
thursday
that
she
would
not
run
for
president
instead
she
is
using
her
popularity
to
launch
fair
fight
an
initiative
to
help
enfranchise
voters
in
a
number
of
key
swing
states
so
far
nine
democratic
candidates
have
qualified
for
september's
democratic
presidential
candidate
debate
by
polling
at
least
in
four
recent
national
or
early-state
polls
and
garnering
campaign
contributions
from
at
least
unique
donors
from
at

hi
are
also
within
striking
distance
of
making
the
debate
stage
the
new
york
times
reported
but
it
is
unclear
whether
other
long-shot
candidates
who
are
unlikely
to
qualify
for
the
debate
such
as
washington

jay
inslee
author
marianne
williamson
u.s.
sen
michael
bennet
co
and
new

city

lead
and
drop
out
