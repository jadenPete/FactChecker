conservatives
rail
against
new
york
times
project
on
america's
sordid
slave
past
an
uproar
over
the
newspaper's
series
exploring
the
nation's
slave
legacy
and
the
rich
and
varied
contributions
of
black
americans
in
a
sweeping
and
ambitious
journalistic
project
the
new
york
times
on
sunday
launched
its
series
reframing
the
american
story
around
a
single
pivotal
historical
event
the
arrival
to
america
years
ago
this
month
of
the
first
enslaved
africans
the
premise
of
the
groundbreaking
initiative
unveiled
in
the
pages
of
the
sunday
magazine
is
that
the
arrival
of
these
captured
africans
was
the
defining
moment
of
american
history
their
bondage
enforced
servitude
and
struggle
for
equality
became
the
leitmotif
of
our
national
narrative
the
contributions
of
black
americans
the
series
posits
is
the
cornerstone
on
which
the
nation's
rich
cultural
legacy
was
built
needless
to
say
conservatives
many
of
whom
can
probably
safely
be
considered
euro-centrists
simply
weren't
having
it
they
revolted
loudly
against
the
notion
that
and
not
would
be
viewed
as
the
seminal
date
in
american
history
and
they
seemed
particularly
nonplussed
at
the
idea
that
african
americans
and
not
white
americans
were
being
put
forward
as
the
key
contributors
to
the
nation's
rich
cultural
heritage
conservative
pundit
byron
york
a
political
analyst
with
the
washington
examiner
said
the
entire
project
raised
questions
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
it
even
amounted
to
journalism
more
denunciations
of
the
project
emanated
from
the
twitter
account
of
newt
gingrich
the
conservative
former
house
speaker
who
called
the
entire
project
propaganda
the
former
history
professor
and
onetime
georgia
lawmaker
took
the
trouble
to
contradict
new
york
times
columnist
mara
gay's
tweet
celebrating
the
massive
effort
that
drew
in
journalists
from
throughout
the
times
newsroom
and
outside
contributors
as
well
twitter
had
an
answer
however
for
gingrich
peter
shulman
an
associate
professor
of
history
at
case
western
reserve
wrote
that
the
former
house
speaker
is
not
exactly
agnostic
on
the
subject
of
the
african
slave
trade
you
wrote
a
dissertation
about
colonialism
in
the
belgian
congo
while
never
going
there
once
and
only
discussed
the
perspective
of
the
white
colonizers
shulman
chided
gingrich
in
a
tweet
more
angry
denunciations
of
the
times
came
sunday
from
the
twitter
account
of
president
donald
trump
who
railed
against
a
racism
witch
hunt
by
the
newspaper
a
possible
reference
to
remarks
made
during
a
town
hall
held
by
new
york
times
editor-in-chief
dean
baquet
in
which
he
told
the
staff
that
the
daily
would
explore
ways
to
thoughtfully
examine
issues
of
race
in
the
coming
months
how
do
we
write
about
race
in
a
thoughtful
way
something
we
haven't
done
in
a
large
way
in
a
long
time
that
to
me
is
the
vision
for
coverage
you
all
are
going
to
have
to
help
us
shape
that
vision
but
i
think
that's
what
we're
going
to
have
to
do
for
the
rest
of
the
next
two
years
baquet
said
according
to
a
leaked
transcript
of
his
remarks
obtained
by
slate
the
gathering
of
times
staff
was
convened
amid
handwringing
in
the
newsroom
over
a
botched
new
york
times
headline
in
the
aftermath
of
the
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
which
read
trump
urges
unity
vs
racism
that
characterization
of
the
tenor
of
the
president's
remarks
drew
howls
of
protest
and
disbelief
from
much
of
the
rest
of
the
media
establishment
but
one
conservative
commentator
never
trumper
and
journalist
david
frum
drew
a
thruline
between
the
controversy
over
trump's
remarks
in
the
wake
of
the
shooting
massacres
and
the
times
sunday
magnum
opus
frum
clapped
back
on
twitter
that
the
president
seemed
to
resent
the
spotlight
being
directed
other
than
on
him
good
morning
america
he
mocked
the
president
on
twitter
i
see
many
of
you
today
talking
about
events
tracing
back
years
stop
that
once
return
to
talking
about
me
