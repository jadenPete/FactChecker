trump
promises
britain
a
very
big
trade
deal
post-brexit
it
comes
even
as
boris
johnson
admits
a
no-deal
brexit
is
increasingly
likely
at
the
g
meeting
in
the
french
town
of
biarritz
president
trump
made
vague
unspecified
promises
to
britain
about
how
it
would
have
itself
a
tremendous
trade
deal
once
it
finally
fulfills
its
promise
to
exit
the
european
union
despite
the
fact
that
neither
the
u.k.
nor
the
eu
have
any
idea
what
the
final
outcome
of
brexit
will
look
like
we're
having
very
good
trade
talks
between
the
u.k.
and
ourselves
we're
going
to
do
a
very
big
trade
deal
bigger
than
we've
ever
had
with
the
uk
trump
said
at
some
point
they
won't
have
the
anchor
around
their
ankle
because
that's
what
they
had
so
we're
going
to
have
some
very
good
trade
talks
and
big
numbers
the
president
added
on
sunday
that
he
and
british
prime
minister
boris
johnson
were
also
discussing
lots
of
fantastic
mini-deals
and
that
they
were
having
a
good
time
again
he
did
not
offer
specifics
meeting
johnson
was
reportedly
one
of
the
few
bright
spot
for
trump
at
the
g-
on
thursday
the
washington
post
reported
that
the
president
had
repeatedly
complained
to
his
aides
about
having
to
attend
the
annual
meeting
and
that
johnson
was
one
of
the
few
people
he
was
looking
forward
to
seeing
it
didn't
help
matters
that
trump
is
currently
engaged
in
several
diplomatic
spats
in
addition
to
the
ongoing
trade
war
with
china
trump
angered
eu
officials
by
suggesting
that
russia
should
be
re-allowed
into
the
g-
it
was
kicked
out
after
the
invasion
of
crimea
in
trump
had
also
caused
anger
earlier
this
week
with
his
bizarre
suggestion
that
the
u.s.
should
buy
greenland
which
is
a
protectorate
of
denmark
despite
the
fact
that
johnson
once
said
that
trump
was
betraying
a
quite
stupefying
ignorance
that
makes
him
frankly
unfit
to
hold
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
johnson
lathered
praise
upon
trump
saying
that
he
wanted
to
actually
congratulate
the
president
on
everything
that
the
american
economy
is
achieving
it's
fantastic
to
see
that
johnson
however
is
facing
plenty
of
problems
of
his
own
when
it
comes
to
delivering
brexit
as
he
is
now
the
third
conservative
prime
minister
to
be
ensnared
by
this
labyrinthine
problem
after
previously
saying
that
the
odds
of
a
potentially
economically
devastating
no-deal
brexit
were
a
million
to
one
johnson
told
the
bbc
at
the
g
meeting
that
it
was
now
touch
and
go
and
that
it
all
depends
on
our
eu
friends
and
partners
one
example
of
the
intricacies
is
the
irish
border
johnson
had
previously
appealed
to
the
eu
to
drop
a
backstop
agreement
which
would
prevent
a
hard-border
between
the
republic
of
ireland
and
northern
ireland
but
the
u.s.
has
warned
that
such
an
undermining
of
the
northern
ireland
peace
process
would
all-but
cancel
any
hopes
of
a
trade
deal
