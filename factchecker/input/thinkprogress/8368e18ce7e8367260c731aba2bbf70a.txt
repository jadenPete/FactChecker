dick's
sporting
goods
removed
guns
from
their
stores
and
sales
are
climbing
the
retail
giant
just
had
their
best
earning
quarter
in
three
years
in
february
ed
stack
announced
that
his
company
dick's
sporting
goods
would
voluntarily
remove
assault-style
weapons
from
their
inventory
and
raise
the
age
to
purchase
any
other
gun
to
the
announcement
came
just
weeks
after
a
gunman
opened
fire
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
parkland
florida
killing
people
one
of
the
guns
used
in
the
shooting
was
purchased
at
a
dick's
sporting
goods
stack's
announcement
was
predictably
met
with
loud
protestations
from
defenders
of
gun
violence
conservatives
promised
boycotts
the
nra
gleefully
celebrated
when
initial
sales
numbers
declined
and
the
retailer's
competitors
went
out
of
their
way
to
reiterate
their
support
for
firearm
sales
by
the
end
of
the
year
dicks
attributed
a
sales
decline
of
million
or
of
annual
revenue
to
the
new
policy
stack
continued
to
defend
his
stance
and
said
the
economic
cost
was
absolutely
worth
it
for
the
company
late
last
week
though
the
company
came
forward
with
a
different
economic
picture
sales
rose
in
the
second
quarter
of
outpacing
the
rest
of
the
retail
market
by
a
comfortable
margin
and
the
company's
highest
single
quarter
sales
boost
in
three
years
the
company's
stock
spiked
after
the
earning
beat
rather
than
backtrack
on
their
stance
on
firearms
the
retailer
doubled
down
banishing
all
guns
including
hunting
rifles
that
they
continued
to
sell
after
their
assault-style
rifle
ban
from
nearly
of
their
retail
locations
the
sporting
goods
giant
stands
in
sharp
contrast
with
another
retail
behemoth
walmart
which
has
refused
to
remove
guns
from
its
shelves
even
after
the
deadly
shooting
at
an
el
paso
texas
location
earlier
this
month
and
that
incident
is
far
from
isolated
according
to
the
gun
violence
archive
there
have
been
hundreds
of
shootings
at
or
in
walmart
locations
in
just
the
last
years
thus
far
the
only
action
walmart
has
taken
in
the
wake
of
the
el
paso
shooting
is
to
ban
violent
imagery
from
its
stores
a
nod
to
the
ridiculous
notion
that
violent
video
games
or
movies
are
responsible
for
the
epidemic
of
mass
shootings
in
the
united
states
the
company's
own
employees
were
so
perturbed
by
their
lack
of
response
to
the
shootings
that
several
staged
a
walkout
if
concern
over
sales
is
the
motivating
factor
for
retailers
not
to
act
on
guns
dicks
strong
earnings
and
surging
stock
price
should
allay
some
of
those
fears
if
retailers
continue
to
do
nothing
then
customers
are
left
to
wonder
exactly
why
executives
are
so
comfortable
aiding
the
murder
of
children
