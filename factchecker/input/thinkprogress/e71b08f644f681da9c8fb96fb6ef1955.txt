trump's
relationship
with
fox
news
is
quickly
fraying
the
president
launched
a
tirade
and
one
former
correspondent
said
he
made
the
network's
reporters
sick
to
their
stomachs
donald
trump
had
a
presidential
pivot
this
week
shifting
aim
from
his
usual
enemies
in
the
press
to
what
has
long
been
his
favorite
network
fox
news
hopeless
clueless
fox
news
should
go
all
the
way
left
and
i
will
still
find
a
way
trump
said
in
a
series
of
tweets
on
wednesday
the
new
foxnews
is
letting
millions
of
great
people
down
we
have
to
start
looking
for
a
new
news
outlet
fox
isn't
working
for
us
anymore
despite
his
regular
cheerleading
of
the
network
and
continued
support
from
reliable
fox
acolytes
like
the
hosts
of
fox
friends
as
well
as
sean
hannity
and
jeanine
pirro
president
donald
trump
has
noticeably
soured
on
fox
news
as
of
late
fox
is
a
lot
different
than
it
used
to
be
he
noted
last
week
there's
something
going
on
at
fox
i'll
tell
you
right
now
and
i'm
not
happy
about
it
he
added
that
he
didn't
understand
why
there
were
negative
polls
about
him
on
fox
news
or
why
the
network
was
pivoting
to
the
democrats
by
hiring
former
dnc
chair
donna
brazile
and
broadcasting
town
halls
featuring
democratic
presidential
candidates
i
think
they're
making
a
big
mistake
because
fox
was
treated
very
badly
by
the
democrats
very
very
badly
having
to
do
with
the
debates
and
other
things
trump
went
on
i
think
fox
is
making
a
big
mistake
because
you
know
i'm
the
one
who
calls
the
shots
on
that
on
the
really
big
debates
trump
has
insulted
specific
fox
news
anchors
including
low
ratings
shep
smith
and
the
pathetic
juan
williams
who
is
also
nasty
and
wrong
but
trump
isn't
the
only
one
irate
about
his
deteriorating
relationship
with
fox
on
wednesday
carl
cameron
who
was
fox's
chief
political
correspondent
until
told
cnn
that
trump's
conflation
of
fox's
opinion
section
with
its
news
section
made
him
and
other
reporters
at
fox
sick
to
their
stomachs
what
he
really
means
is
i
need
to
have
more
opinion
people
who
espouse
more
opinions
said
cameron
now
a
correspondent
for
a
progressive
site
front
page
live
joe
romm
the
founder
and
editor-in-chief
of
front
page
live
is
also
a
reporter
at
thinkprogress
trump's
tweets
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
the
news
department
at
fox
news
where
i
worked
for
a
number
of
years
sick
to
their
stomachs
news
people
don't
like
to
hear
that
stuff
cameron
continued
the
entertainment
side
one
the
other
hand
is
vastly
different
and
it's
a
threat
to
them
and
trump
is
basically
challenging
the
sean
hannitys
of
fox
news
to
beat
up
on
their
journalists
that's
not
going
to
work
either
but
trump
needs
to
be
careful
with
his
attacks
on
fox
news
the
president
is
performing
poorly
in
polls
that
match
him
up
against
potential
democratic
challengers
in
the
election
and
that
could
become
more
problematic
if
the
u.s.
creeps
into
a
recession
as
a
usa
today
and
suffolk
university
poll
shows
in
a
mock
matchup
trump
earns
more
than
half
his
support
from
those
who
trust
fox
more
than
any
other
network
among
those
who
strongly
approve
of
trump
prefer
fox
to
any
other
outlet
all
of
that
means
that
there's
a
significant
overlap
between
trump
supporters
and
fox
news
viewers
and
no
other
conservative
network
comes
close
to
matching
the
reach
that
fox
has
so
for
trump
to
marshal
his
base
to
win
reelection
he's
going
to
need
all
the
help
from
fox
that
he
can
get
