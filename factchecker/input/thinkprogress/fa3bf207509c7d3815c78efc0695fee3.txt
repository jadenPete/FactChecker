study
shows
a
concerning
rise
in
the
number
of
deaths
among
environmental
defenders
these
deaths
represent
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
of
the
violence
that
environmental
defenders
face
defending
the
environment
is
an
increasingly
deadly
effort
according
to
new
research
the
number
of
people
around
the
world
who
have
died
trying
to
protect
land
water
forests
and
other
natural
resources
has
doubled
in
the
past
years
between
and
people
across
different
countries
were
killed
for
protecting
the
environment
a
new
study
published
in
the
journal
nature
sustainability
found
this
is
more
than
the
number
of
british
and
australian
soldiers
who
have
been
killed
in
active
duty
overseas
in
war
zones
during
the
same
period
and
it
is
almost
half
the
number
of
u.s.
soldiers
who
have
died
fighting
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
since
environmental
defenders
include
people
such
as
community
activists
lawyers
journalists
staff
from
non-governmental
organizations
members
of
social
movements
and
indigenous
peoples
the
study
sought
to
look
specifically
at
deaths
related
to
individual
people
or
communities
due
to
acts
of
resistance
and
or
efforts
to
protect
land
or
environmental
rights
as
opposed
to
large-scale
armed
conflict
rooted
in
clashes
over
natural
resources
people
are
dying
to
protect
their
livelihoods
along
with
the
forests
lands
and
ecosystems
that
are
essential
for
all
our
futures
the
study
reads
in
alone
at
least
people
were
killed
related
to
their
efforts
to
defend
the
environment
and
in
a
year
not
included
in
the
study
people
were
killed
according
to
global
witness
which
monitors
these
deaths
and
whose
data
was
used
in
the
study
but
as
the
researchers
note
these
deaths
represent
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
of
the
violence
that
environmental
defenders
face
for
every
defender
murdered
thousands
more
face
direct
violence
threats
and
psychological
intimidation
and
more
invisible
cultural
and
structural
violence
the
study
states
the
varying
extent
of
free
media
and
human
rights
monitors
in
some
countries
also
limits
the
amount
of
data
available
some
deaths
may
not
ever
be
recorded
officially
more
than
anyone
else
indigenous
people
represented
of
all
deaths
in
and
and
in
most
of
these
deaths
occurred
in
the
philippines
and
colombia
central
america
is
the
most
dangerous
region
with
of
all
deaths
between
and
followed
by
south
america
and
asia
the
most
number
of
deaths
tied
to
the
agriculture
sector
between
and
took
place
in
brazil
and
the
philippines
brazil
is
also
responsible
for
the
most
deaths
linked
to
logging
mining
and
extraction
sector
deaths
were
highest
in
the
philippines
colombia
and
india
while
poaching-related
deaths
were
most
frequent
in
vietnam
and
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
a
large
factor
contributing
to
this
violence
the
study
states
is
weak
rule
of
law
for
instance
it
is
estimated
that
on
average
just
over
of
these
murders
are
convicted
globally
this
is
compared
to
an
average
of
homicides
being
convicted
worldwide
according
to
figures
cited
in
the
study
additionally
violence
is
often
perpetuated
by
corruption
within
local
policy
and
judiciary
branches
leading
to
many
deaths
being
improperly
investigated
sometimes
it's
the
police
or
government
that
are
directly
responsible
for
the
deaths
or
have
financial
ties
to
those
responsible
many
of
these
deaths
also
happen
in
remote
areas
with
little
government
or
police
presence
which
means
it's
a
lot
harder
to
gather
evidence
one
way
or
another
this
creates
a
situation
in
which
the
killers
essentially
know
they're
not
going
to
get
caught

the

highlights
two

leaders
who
have
particularly
egregious
records
under

in

there
was
a
increase
in
the
murder
of
environmental

between
and
following
the
election
of
brazil's
president
jair

fears
have
mounted
that
indigenous
peoples
defending
their
environment
will
be
increasingly
targeted
as
the
study
notes
brazil
is
consistently
the
country
with
the
highest
number
of
deaths
of
environmental
defenders
especially
indigenous
peoples
and
bolsonaro
has
vowed
to
relax
both
gun
laws
and
environmental
protections
as
well
as
label
ngos
and
activists
as
terrorists
while
no
deaths
have
occurred
during
the
period
studied
in
places
such
as
the
united
states
and
the
u.k.
the
study
warns
that
the
atmosphere
in
these
two
countries
is
becoming
more
hostile
in
three
fracking
protesters
in

were
convicted
of
causing
public
nuisance
for
their
non-violent
direct
action
the
first
time
environmental
activists
have
received
jail
time
for
a
protest
in
the
u.k.
since
meanwhile
in
the
united
states
the
dakota
access
pipeline
protests
saw
several
demonstrators
hospitalized
after
authorities
used
a
water
cannon
in
sub-zero
temperatures
to
disperse
crowds
and
increasingly
under
president
donald
trump
new
laws
are
being
proposed
at
both
the
state
and
federal
level
to
crackdown
on
pipeline
protesters
from
increased
fines
and
jail
time
to
increasing
the
severity
of
certain
actions
such
as

or

a
protest
from
a
misdemeanor
to
felony
