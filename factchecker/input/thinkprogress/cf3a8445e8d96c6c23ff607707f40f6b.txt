party
running
in

making
up
less

of
the
record
number
of
women
serving
in
the
th
congress
the
gop
has
been
attempting
to
emphasize
the
women
running
in
at
various
levels
of
government
despite
the
many
polls
showing
women
now
increasingly
and
overwhelmingly
leaning
democratic
ramirez
mukherjee
said
on
wednesday
that
after
two
and
a
half
decades
women
are
no
longer
hiding
their
republican
views
because
social
issues
are
no
longer
a
factor
when
i
first
got
involved
in
politics
at
uc
berkeley
we
went
into
hiding
our
country
fought
over
social
issues
and
that
divided
us
as
a
country
and
as
a
party
she
said
over
the
last
years
i
feel
we
have
started
to
resolve
those
social
discussions
and
we
are
shifting
to
the
fiscal
side
she
continued
as
a
woman
as
a
mom
a
business
woman
someone
who
runs
my
household
the
fiscal
is
what
i
care
so
deeply
about
other
women
like
me
republican
women
like
me
finally
are
gonna
have
a
chance
to
come
out
and
say
i
am
a
republican
too
social
issues
of
course
remain
a
huge
deal
numerous
republican-led
state
legislatures
have
enacted
legislation
just
this
year
seeking
to
ban
virtually
all
abortions
even
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
the
trump
administration
has
also
worked
tirelessly
to
strip
rights
from
lgbtq
americans
sought
to
impose
a
ban
on
muslim
people
entering
the
country
fought
against
equal
pay
legislation
and
shrugged
at
both
the
metoo
movement
to
stop
sexual
predation
and
the
troubling
rise
in
white
supremacist
violence
ramirez
mukherjee's
campaign
website
does
not
currently
have
any
issues
section
and
makes
no
mention
of
any
of
these
topics
later
in
the
interview
she
echoed
the
popular
republican
talking-point
that
identity
politics
are
a
bad
thing
before
attempting
to
make
her
own
identity
a
campaign
selling
point
i
ve
always
my
whole
life
have
been
careful
to
n
ever
play
identity
politics
she
claimed
because
up
until
i
would
say
i
was
in
my
low
s
i
didn't
see
a
difference
in
who
i
was
based
on
a
woman
or
someone
else
being
a
man
or
being
mexican-american
i
judged
myself
always
on
performance
but
when
you
say
why
do
we
want
more
women
at
the
table
it's
because
it
gives
a
perspective
ramirez
mukherjee
then
contradicted
her
claim
that
social
issues
no
longer
matter
saying
the
topics
we
are
talking
about
around
reproductive
health
around
family
around
education
around
safety
climate
those
are
things
that
i
feel
someone
that
has
a
different
background
a
different
professional
background
comes
from
somewhere
else
it
gives
a
perspective
that
others
don't
have
at
the
table
currently
