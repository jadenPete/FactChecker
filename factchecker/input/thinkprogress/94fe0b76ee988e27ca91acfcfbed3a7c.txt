but
wants

prison

barreled
his
truck
through
a
crowd
of

outside
a

putting
a
year-old
man
in
the
hospital
overnight
captain
thomas
woodworth
struck

another
local
who
were
part
of

a
human

comment
and
hung
up
the
phone
though

initially
diagnosed

with
a
broken
leg
he
told
thinkprogress
on
friday
that
an
orthopedist
later
determined
he
had
at
worst
a
hairline
fracture
that
would
not
require
a
cast
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
little
over
hours
in
total
before
being
sent
home
with
instructions
to
follow
up
with
his
primary
doctor
in
a
week
the
short
of
it
is
i'm
fine
belair
said
in
an
interview
everybody
wants
to
focus
on
the
injuries
and
stuff
they
should
be
focused
on
the
first
amendment
belair
said
he
thought
he
had
left
his
civil
disobedience
days
behind
him
describing
his
role
in
mass
actions
at
nuclear
weapon
plants
in
the
s
the
current
treatment
of
immigrants
changed
his
mind
he
said
the
last
time
i
was
arrested
was
years
ago
belair
said
and
i
finally
decided
this
was
a
good
enough
cause
to
do
that
again
this
present
government
of
ours
not
providing
people
with
opportunities
to
seek
asylum
separating
families
arresting
people
taking
away
their
ability
to
make
a
living
and
support
their
families
you
know
in
they
came
for
the
foreign-born
jews
first
the
demonstration
was
organized
by
never
again
action
an
activist
coalition
rooted
in
the
jewish
community
never
again
has
taken
a
prominent
role
in
local
protests
against
ice
activity
in
several
places
around
the
country
since
president
donald
trump
began
imposing
harsher
policies
on
immigrants
nationwide
the
protesters
in
central
falls
had
sought
to
blockade
the
entrances
and
exits
around
wyatt
in
the
evening
hours
wednesday
after
woodworth
careened
his
truck
through
the
crowd
protesters
who
had
initially
scattered
for
safety
coalesced
in
an
angry
knot
near
the
entrance
he'd
just
reached
woodworth's
colleagues
from
the
wyatt
staff
then
rushed
out
and
pepper
sprayed
the
crowd
officers
from
the
city
police
force
had
been
on
hand
monitoring
the
protest
during
the
hours
before
belair
and
others
physically
blocked
the
employee
parking
lot
entrance
in
anticipation
of
a
shift
change
he
said
but
those
officers
left
the
protest
site
shortly
before
the
truck
rammed
through
the
group
belair
said
and
did
not
return
until
after
the
guards
had
come
out
and
sprayed
the
crowd
i'm
still
looking
for
the
police
like
where
are
the
police
belair
said
some
kids
got
it
full
in
the
face
everybody
was
freaked
out
there
were
people
down
and
then
the
police
showed
up
police
had
been
there
earlier
at
the
protest
but
disbanded
just
minutes
before
the
truck
rammed
the
crowd
according
to
eyewitnesses
state
police
city
police
and
officials
from
the
state
attorney
general's
office
are
now
reportedly
investigating
the
incident
wyatt's
own
staff
are
conducting
a
separate
internal
review
prison
officials
said
in
a
statement
the
prison
also
supports
the
first
amendment
right
of
citizens
to
peacefully
protest
on
public
property
surrounding
the
facility
the
statement
said
wyatt
was
the
nation's
first
publicly
owned
privately
run
prison
when
it
opened
in
it
provides
a
key
revenue
stream
to
the
tiny
person
town
which
is
just
a
few
years
removed
from
a
brutal
municipal
bankruptcy
process
that
forced
retirees
to
take
huge
cuts
so
that
the
towns
lenders
could
get
paid
the
prison's
primary
long-term
customers
are
the
u.s.
marshall's
service
and
the
u.s.
navy
and
it
had
not
done
business
with
ice
for
roughly
a
decade
prior
to
this
spring
warden
daniel
martin
agreed
a
contract
with
the
agency
over
the
winter
and
an
initial
immigration
detainees
were
shipped
in
to
central
falls
in
march
the
move
sparked
immediate
and
broad
objection
across
the
region
coastal
new
england
has
long
benefited
from
waves
of
immigration
and
many
towns
there
continue
to
be
home
to
large
deeply
rooted
multigenerational
communities
with
ties
to
european
southeast
asian
and
latin
american
countries
opponents
of
trump's
policies
have
used
similar
protest
tactics
at
ice
and
customs
and
border
protection
cbp
facilities
around
the
country
in
recent
years
and
have
been
lobbying
local
leaders
to
sever
ties
with
federal
immigration
agencies
even
when
those
local
officials
are
sympathetic
to
those
calls
they
typically
have
insisted
they
had
no
practical
authority
to
kick
ice
or
cbp
out
of
town
but
in
april
central
falls
mayor
james
diossa
d
himself
the
son
of
colombian
immigrants
announced
he
would
ask
the
prison's
governing
board
to
rescind
the
ice
deal
the
board
approved
the
request
less
than
a
week
later
central
falls
got
sued
in
federal
court
by
the
bankers
that
loaned
money
to
wyatt
they
argued
that
the
city
had
no
right
to
force
the
prison
that
owes
them
money
to
rip
up
a
lucrative
federal
contract
the
case
is
ongoing
but
a
federal
judge
issued
an
injunction
to
keep
the
ice
prisoners
at
wyatt
until
the
matter
is
fully
resolved
in
court
protesters
have
sought
to
keep
pressure
on
the
facility
ever
since
wednesday's
action
was
only
the
latest
in
a
series
of
protests
around
the
wyatt
perimeter
some
of
those
demonstrations
have
included
civil
disobedience
leading
to
arrests
never
again
action
estimated
the
total
crowd
wednesday
at
people
out
of
which
used
their
bodies
to
physically
block
wyatt's
entrances
the
human
blockade
had
been
in
place
for
hours
when
woodworth
plowed
through
the
crowd
and
put
belair
in
the
hospital
one
attendee
immediately
made
the
obvious
connection
to
the
murder
of
heather
heyer
by
a
white
supremacist
who
intentionally
drove
into
an
un-escorted
crowd
of
anti-racism
demonstrators
in
charlottesville
virginia
in
there
have
been
numerous
close
calls
since
including
one
at
an
immigration
march
in
los
angeles
in
and
another
at
a
vigil
following
the
police
killing
of
stephon
clark
last
year
blocking
roadways
as
a
long
history
as
a
protest
technique
but
it
came
to
particular
prominence
as
the
movement
for
black
lives
earned
national
attention
and
made
effective
use
of
the
tactic
although
protesters
targeting
structural
racism
have
a
particularly
strong
reason
to
target
highways
many
of
which
were
intentionally
used
to
destroy
thriving
black
communities
and
reinforce
residential
segregation
in
charlotte
sacramento
and
scores
of
other
cities
back
when
the
federal
highway
system
was
first
built
the
political
right
has
decried
and
vilified
this
mode
of
dissent
some
lawmakers
and
talking
heads
have
even
explicitly
encouraged
drivers
to
mow
down
protesters
who
block
their
paths
these
incitements
come
in
a
range
of
flavors
the
daily
caller
compiled
a
reel
of
cars
plowing
through
protesters
trying
to
block
the
road
which
was
picked
up
by
fox
news's
website
a
police
union
leader
in
new
mexico
posted
a
facebook
meme
captioned
all
lives
splatter
featuring
an
image
of
a
jeep
plowing
through
a
crowd
as
slate
put
it
in
a
round-up
of
long-standing
conservative
fantasies
of
running
down
protesters
state
lawmakers
in
north
dakota
tennessee
north
carolina
florida
texas
and
rhode
island
itself
have
all
introduced
or
flirted
with
legislation
indemnifying
drivers
who
hurt
protesters
with
their
cars
