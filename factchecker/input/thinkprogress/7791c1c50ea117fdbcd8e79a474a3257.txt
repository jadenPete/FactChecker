new
ncaa
agent
requirements
are
rooted
in
racism
just
like
everything
else
the
ncaa
does
the
reality
of
therichpaulrule
it's
been
a
year
since
the
ncaa
decided
to
allow
college
basketball
players
who
want
to
test
the
waters
of
the
nba
draft
to
consult
with
an
agent
without
losing
their
eligibility
a
move
generally
seen
by
outside
observers
as
an
important
step
toward
fair
treatment
of
these
student-athletes
however
whenever
anything
the
ncaa
does
seems
even
remotely
positive
or
athlete-friendly
you
d
better
believe
there's
a
catch
this
week
that
catch
came
in
the
form
of
ridiculously
over-the-top
regulations
that
appear
custom-targeted
toward
dampening
the
influence
of
one
of
the
few
black
agents
at
the
top
of
the
game
rich
paul
lebron
james
long-time
agent
and
business
partner
on
tuesday
the
ncaa
issued
a
memo
clarifying
that
if
an
underclassmen
wants
to
retain
his
ncaa
eligibility
meaning
he
wants
the
ability
to
return
to
college
if
after
consulting
with
agents
and
working
out
for
teams
he
thinks
his
draft
stock
would
be
improved
by
spending
another
year
in
school
then
any
agent
he
talks
to
must
meet
three
criteria
they
must
pass
an
in-person
exam
administered
in
indianapolis
where
ncaa
headquarters
are
located
be
certified
by
the
nba
players
association
for
three
years
and
have
a
bachelor's
degree
paul
it
turns
out
does
not
have
a
bachelor's
degree
he
does
however
have
an
enormous
amount
of
clout
paul
met
james
in
quickly
becoming
close
friends
with
the
superstar
while
james
was
setting
records
on
the
court
in
the
nba
paul
was
learning
the
business
side
of
basketball
working
at
the
creative
artists
agency
caa
he
left
caa
in
to
start
his
own
agency
klutch
sports
which
now
represents
james
anthony
davis
and
draymond
green
among
others
because
of
this
james
and
other
nba
stars
quickly
dubbed
these
newly
mandated
certifications
the
rich
paul
rule
some
might
be
tempted
to
buy
the
ncaa's
defense
of
these
new
requirements
that
this
is
all
about
protecting
student-athletes
from
predatory
agents
who
will
give
them
bad
advice
and
steer
them
astray
but
of
course
there
already
is
a
certification
process
in
place
which
is
run
by
the
national
basketball
players
association
nbpa
any
further
structure
duct-taped
onto
this
existing
process
has
but
one
purpose
bolstering
the
ncaa's
power
over
these
athletes
and
reinforcing
the
league's
propaganda
that
a
college
degree
is
the
ultimate
prize
the
timing
hardly
seems
coincidental
as
james
pointed
out
this
announcement
comes
soon
after
paul
arranged
for
elite
basketball
prospect
darius
bazley
to
skip
the
ncaa
system
altogether
and
instead
earn
million
as
an
intern
for
new
balance
paul
feels
no
allegiance
toward
propping
up
a
system
that
exploits
the
labor
of
young
black
men
while
the
league's
rich
white
fat
cats
rake
in
millions
a
scheme
so
transparent
that
even
some
republican
lawmakers
have
taken
aim
at
the
searing
injustice
paul's
increasing
power
and
influence
has
rattled
many
in
the
nba
as
he
has
orchestrated
incredibly
lucrative
and
player-friendly
contracts
for
his
clients
and
now
it
seems
the
ncaa
is
terrified
too
it
makes
sense
that
the
ncaa
bigwigs
are
scared
there
is
currently
a
bipartisan
push
to
end
amateurism
the
nba
is
getting
rid
of
its
one-and-done
rule
which
requires
players
to
have
a
year
between
high
school
and
college
before
entering
the
draft
and
the
nba
g-league
a
developmental
league
for
nba
players
has
even
established
a
program
targeted
toward
players
coming
out
of
high
school
giving
them
an
option
that
does
not
involve
stepping
into
the
ncaa
cartel
yes
college
degrees
are
still
important
but
in
the
world
of
athletics
they're
not
everything
the
only
institution
that
hasn't
accepted
this
is
the
ncaa
