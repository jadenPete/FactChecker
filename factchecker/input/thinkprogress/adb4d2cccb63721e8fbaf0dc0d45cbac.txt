the
texas
walmart
targeted
by
an
alleged
racist
mass
murderer
on
saturday
was
so
crowded
at
the
time
of
the
attack
that
authorities
and
family
members
are
still
struggling
to
identify
all
of
those
who

complex
and
arduous

calm
thing
despite
a
crush

medical
personnel
and
aid
workers
what
i
saw
was
an
incredible
amount
of
dignity
among

up
there
they
were
there
to
find
out
the
fate
of
loved
ones
whether
