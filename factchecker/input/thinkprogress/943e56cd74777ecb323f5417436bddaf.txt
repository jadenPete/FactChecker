mcconnell
in
new
campaign
ad
it
comes

in
kentucky
continue
to
block

amy
mcgrath
a
former
marine
corps
fighter
pilot
who
is
now
seeking
the
democratic
nomination
to
run
for
the
u.s.
senate
in
kentucky
released
a
blistering
new
ad
taking
aim
at
her
potential
general
election
opponent
and
current
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
for
his
failure
to
help
the
state's
coal
miners
we
were
coal
miners
with
black
lung
disease
going
to
see
our
senator
mitch
mcconnell
to
try
and
save
our
disability
benefits
miner
jimmy
moore
says
in
the
video
which
has
already
been
viewed
more
than
million
times
ten
hours
on
a
bus
and
we
got
to
see
him
for
all
of
one
minute
moore
added
that
mcconnell
had
let
the
coal
companies
walk
away
from
the
miners
moore
along
with
other
miners
travelled
to
d.c.
in
july
since
coal
companies
have
been
required
to
pay
per
ton
of
underground
coal
to
finance
the
federal
black
lung
disability
trust
fund
which
supports
miners
when
their
employers
can
no
longer
pay
out
medical
benefits
but
congress
this
year
declined
to
take
action
to
maintain
the
fund
meaning
that
it
reverted
to
its
pre-
rate
of
just
cents
per
ton
mcconnell's
spokeswoman
said
at
the
time
that
the
senator
was
working
closely
with
interested
parties
regarding
future
funding
for
the
program
and
will
continue
to
ensure
these
important
benefits
are
maintained
but
did
not
offer
specifics
and
met
with
the
miners
for
barely
two
minutes
which
miner
george
massey
described
at
the
time
as
a
low
down
shame
the
mcgrath
video
is
not
the
only
example
of
miner
anger
simmering
in
kentucky
for
weeks
now
miners
have
been
blocking
a
train
full
loaded
with
roughly
million
worth
of
coal
from
leaving
its
plant
in
harlan
county
kentucky
the
protest
started
after
blackjewel
a
coal
mining
company
with
over
a
thousand
employees
in
appalachia
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
closed
down
without
filing
a
mandatory
days
warning
notice
this
meant
that
miners
were
left
high-and-dry
with
workers
receiving
no
pay
for
their
final
week
and
discovering
that
their
paycheck
for
the
previous
two
weeks
had
bounced
all
while
they
needed
money
to
pay
for
child
support
healthcare
mortgages
and
other
expenses
lawyers
estimate
that
blackjewel
owes
the
protesting
miners
around
each
mcconnell
has
stated
his
support
for
the
miners
saying
earlier
in
august
that
he
believes
strongly
these
miners
should
be
paid
in
full
for
their
work
and
is
monitoring
the
situation
miners
however
are
cautious
about
mcconnell's
alleged
support
for
them
whenever
you
call
mcconnell's
office
he
can't
talk
to
you
collin
cornette
who
was
one
of
the
miners
protesting
previously
said
to
my
knowledge
he
has
not
even
made
a
statement
he's
not
pro-coal
i
don't
even
think
he's
pro-kentucky
