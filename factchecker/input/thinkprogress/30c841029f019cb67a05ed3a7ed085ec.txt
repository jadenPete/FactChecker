why
trump
might
be
panicking
about
suburban
women
they
don't
like
guns
or
racism
the
campaign
to
reelect
president
donald
trump
embarked
on
a
special
effort
thursday
to
mobilize
suburban
women
across
battleground
states
the
campaign
is
acting
as
if
it
believes
these
women
are
secretly
maga
voters
through
and
through
it's
more
likely
that
they're
actually
panicking
about
how
quickly
their
support
is
plummeting
with
a
demographic
they
carried
in
the
election
proved
that
these
suburban
women
were
leaning
purple
even
in
republican
strongholds
like
texas
they
played
a
massive
part
in
turning
the
house
back
over
to
the
democrats
as
trump
fights
to
win
them
back
several
of
the
issues
that
tend
to
resonate
most
with
them
happen
to
correspond
with
some
of
the
biggest
obstacles
the
trump
administration
has
been
facing
trump
has
spent
much
of
the
summer
spouting
all
kinds
of
racist
comments
from
his
attacks
on
congresswomen
of
color
known
as
the
squad
to
his
invective
against
baltimore
and
rep
elijah
cummings
d-md
to
his
recent
comments
about
how
jews
should
vote
for
republicans
out
of
loyalty
to
israel
as
the
ap
news
found
last
month
through
dozens
of
interviews
suburban
women
recoil
at
the
abrasive
divisive
rhetoric
as
one
democratic
strategist
told
the
atlantic
this
month
trump's
penchant
for
divisive
and
racist
rhetoric
has
made
it
harder
for
white
people
who
might
have
been
inclined
to
vote
for
him
in
to
do
so
again
what
trump
is
doing
now
is
putting
skin
in
the
game
for
middle-of-the-road
white
voters
explained
cornell
belcher
a
survey
from
a
republican
polling
firm
found
this
month
that
there
are
even
more
reasons
to
be
concerned
an
overwhelming
percentage
of
suburban
women
worry
that
the
country
is
headed
in
the
wrong
direction
to
they
disapprove
of
trump
to
and
are
heavily-tilted
toward
supporting
a
democrat
for
congress
to
moreover
nearly
a
third
of
the
women
said
that
preventing
gun
violence
should
be
the
nation's
top
priority
believing
that
stricter
laws
will
help
prevent
gun
violence
they
support
universal
background
checks
to
a
hour
waiting
period
to
red
flag
laws
to
and
an
assault
weapons
ban
to
support
was
consistent
when
just
looking
at
white
women
in
the
wake
of
two
shootings
earlier
this
month
trump
has
already
ruled
out
both
an
assault
weapons
ban
and
universal
background
checks
essentially
abandoning
efforts
to
pass
what
these
suburban
women
think
is
one
of
the
country's
highest
priorities
what's
notable
from
the
poll
is
also
how
few
women
thought
the
economy
was
the
highest
priority
after
gun
safety
the
other
top
concerns
were
health
care
and
immigration
but
only
far
fewer
were
concerned
about
the
economy
or
federal
spending
but
curiously
the
trump
campaign
appears
to
be
focusing
on
an
economic
message
to
try
to
energize
these
voters
trump
campaign
spokesperson
kayleigh
mcenany
explained
to
fox
news
thursday
morning
that
none
of
these
polls
is
a
concern
that's
because
she
believes
the
women
who
support
trump
don't
talk
to
pollsters
or
the
media
she
similarly
told
politico
i'm
confident
there
are
a
number
of
female
voters
out
there
who
don't
talk
to
pollsters
and
don't
register
in
polls
but
support
the
president
she
did
not
explain
how
she
knows
what
a
group
thinks
if
it
never
publicly
says
what
it
thinks
given
the
targeted
push
on
this
particular
demographic
she
may
not
really
think
their
support
is
as
robust
as
she
claims
