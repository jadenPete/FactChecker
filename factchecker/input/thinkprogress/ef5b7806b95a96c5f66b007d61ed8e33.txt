fec
republicans
block
efforts
to
investigate
nra's
financial
ties
to
russia
it's
the
latest
roadblock
in
trying
to
untangle
the
nra's
links
with
a
sanctioned
russian
figure
late
last
week
the
federal
election
commission
fec
deadlocked
on
whether
to
pursue
an
investigation
into
potential
russian
financing
of
the
national
rifle
association
nra
the
split
vote
fell
along
partisan
lines
with
the
fec's
two
republicans
voting
against
any
further
inquiry
into
whether
alexander
torshin
a
sanctioned
russian
official
and
maria
butina
a
convicted
russian
agent
grew
close
to
the
nra
in
order
to
help
direct
the
group's
political
donations
fec
chair
ellen
weintraub
castigated
her
republican
colleagues
in
an
open
letter
issued
immediately
after
the
vote
in
the
letter
weintraub
noted
that
the
nra
not
only
admitted
that
it
had
received
previous
donations
from
unidentified
russian
nationals
but
that
the
nra
likewise
saw
a
substantial
spike
in
its
own
political
donations
in
issuing
nearly
million
more
in
political
donations
in
than
in
the
previous
presidential
election
the
nra
admitted
that
butina
had
once
paid
nearly
at
a
nra
fundraiser
but
said
it
was
unable
to
locate
any
donations
from
torshin
or
sanctioned
russian
official
dmitry
rogozin
with
whom
nra
officials
also
met
in
moscow
in
indeed
weintraub's
letter
was
scathing
regarding
both
her
republicans
colleagues
votes
against
further
investigation
as
well
as
regarding
the
nra's
relationship
with
torshin
and
butina
as
weintraub
wrote
weintraub
wasn't
the
only
one
to
condemn
the
fec
republicans
votes
in
a
statement
to
thinkprogress
sen
ron
wyden
d-or
slammed
fec
republicans
a
foreign
adversary
interfered
in
the
presidential
election
and
the
response
from
republicans
at
every
level
whether
it
be
president
donald
trump
congressional
republicans
or
now
the
republican
appointees
on
the
federal
election
commission
has
been
to
bury
their
heads
in
the
sand
or
actively
obstruct
getting
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
wyden
said
it's
unclear
what
next
steps
may
remain
to
uncover
ties
between
russia
and
the
nra
the
gun-rights
group
has
imploded
over
the
past
few
months
with
unprecedented
infighting
spilling
into
the
public
six
nra
board
members
have
already
resigned
this
year
and
multiple
attorneys
general
have
opened
formal
inquiries
into
the
group's
internal
financing
regardless
of
the
fec
vote
it's
clear
that
the
group's
proximity
to
torshin
and
butina
in
the
lead-up
to
the
election
was
to
say
the
least
inadvisable
as
a
series
of
internal
fbi
analyses
released
just
earlier
this
month
indicate
torshin
who
had
previously
been
linked
to
a
massive
spanish
money
laundering
operation
was
considered
by
the
fbi
a
mobster
who
was
well-known
for
his
ties
to
russian
organized
crime
and
the
russian
government
