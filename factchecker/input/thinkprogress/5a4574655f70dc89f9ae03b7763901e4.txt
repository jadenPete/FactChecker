democratic
congressman
criticized
for
sharing
public
information
on
top
trump
donors
republicans
themselves
have
called
for
such
funding
disclosures
in
the
past
republicans
were
incensed
after
rep
joaquin
castro
d-tx
on
monday
tweeted
the
names
of
san
antonio-based
top
donors
to
president
donald
trump's
campaign
the
information
is
all
publicly
available
through
the
federal
election
commission's
website
which
lists
the
name
location
employer
and
occupation
of
every
person
who
gives
more
than
to
a
federal
political
committee
castro
did
not
post
any
addresses
phone
numbers
or
any
other
personal
information
aside
from
their
names
and
businesses
castro
whose
grandmother
emigrated
from
mexico
in
the
s
wrote
in
the
tweet
that
the
campaign
contributions
were
fueling
a
campaign
of
hate
that
labels
hispanic
immigrants
as
invaders
referring
to
trump's
rhetoric
on
immigrants
that
in
part
allegedly
motivated
the
el
paso
shooter
to
kill
over
people
in
a
primarily
latinx
border
town
last
weekend
sad
to
see
so
many
san
antonians
as
maximum
donors
to
donald
trump
he
wrote
regardless
of
the
information
being
public
data
republicans
and
even
some
members
of
the
mainstream
press
have
called
castro's
list
dangerous
and
compared
it
to
doxxing
the
act
of
publishing
someone's
private
information
the
hashtag
impeachjoaquincastro
amplified
mostly
by
troll-bots
even
began
trending
on
twitter
wednesday
targeting
and
harassing
americans
because
of
their
political
beliefs
is
shameful
and
dangerous
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
wrote
on
twitter
tuesday
what
happened
to
when
they
go
low
we
go
high
or
does
that
no
longer
matter
when
your
brother
presidential
candidate
juli
n
castro
is
polling
at
americans
deserve
better
mccarthy
himself
was
actually
forced
to
delete
a
tweet
last
october
criticizing
jewish
democratic
donors
for
supposedly
trying
to
buy
the
midterm
elections
the
tweet
had
been
posted
days
before
a
racist
anti-semitic
gunman
opened
fire
at
the
pittsburgh
tree
of
life
synagogue
killing
people
we
cannot
allow
soros
steyer
and
bloomberg
to
buy
this
election
get
out
and
vote
republican
november
th
maga
the
now-retracted
october
tweet
read
the
alleged
shooter
in
the
tree
of
life
attack
which
occurred
on
october
touted
similar
claims
summoning
up
several
baseless
conspiracy
theories
about
liberal
billionaire
philanthropist
george
soros
whom
mccarthy
had
mentioned
in
his
tweet
mccarthy
later
defended
his
comments
stating
in
march
that
he
had
simply
been
pointing
out
money
that
republicans
and
democrats
were
spending
to
defeat
one
another
fellow
texan
sen
ted
cruz
r-tx
also
claimed
this
week
that
castro's
tweet
about
top
trump
donors
went
against
the
constitution
and
should
be
retracted
everyone
needs
to
tone
the
hateful
partisan
rhetoric
way
down
this
is
wrong
castro
should
retract
it
cruz
tweeted
in
our
constitutional
republic
the
people
rightly
hold
their
representatives
accountable
elected
representatives
should
not
be
vilifying
doxxing
their
own
constituents
house
republican
whip
steve
scalise
from
louisiana
who
survived
a
shooting
at
a
congressional
baseball
match
two
years
ago
also
called
castro's
tweet
dangerous
people
should
not
be
personally
targeted
for
their
political
views
period
he
tweeted
this
isn't
a
game
it's
dangerous
and
lives
are
at
stake
i
know
this
firsthand
the
president's
son
donald
trump
jr
took
things
a
step
further
appearing
on
fox
friends
wednesday
morning
and
comparing
castro's
tweet
to
an
alleged
hit-list
the
dayton
shooter
had
compiled
years
earlier
that
thing
sort
of
screams
like
the
dayton
ohio
shooter's
list
he
said
it's
pretty
scary
on
tuesday
night
castro
responded
to
his
critics
no
one
was
targeted
or
harassed
in
my
post
you
know
that
all
that
info
is
routinely
published
he
tweeted
sharing
mccarthy's
post
you're
trying
to
distract
from
the
racism
that
has
overtaken
the
gop
and
the
fact
that
president
trump
spends
donor
money
on
thousands
of
ads
about
hispanics
invading
america
the
sudden
change
in
opinion
is
surprising
coming
from
republicans
who
have
routinely
highlighted
the
identities
of
democratic
donors
and
advocated
for
funding
disclosures
in
the
past
in
early
at
the
height
of
the
republican
primary
cruz
posted
a
number
of
tweets
identifying
some
of
then-candidate
trump's
past
political
donations
trump
jr
has
similarly
tweeted
lists
of
donors
to
democratic
campaigns
that
utilized
public
fec
data
going
after
democratic
donors
has
been
a
pillar
of
the
republican
party
for
decades
and
using
fec
data
to
expose
an
opponent's
contributions
is
a
tried
and
true
trope
in
most
republican
attack
ads
i
don't
like
it
when
a
large
source
of
money
is
out
there
funding
ads
and
is
unaccountable
then-sen
jeff
sessions
r-al
said
in
to
the
extent
we
can
i
tend
to
favor
disclosure
and
in
october
last
year
a
national
republican
congressional
committee

against
kathy
manning

former

which
she
had
previously
donated

this

of
his
initial
tweet
