white
nationalism
is
a
domestic
terror
threat
here
are
some
policies
that
can
address
it
instead
of
a
militarized
approach
officials
should
focus
first
on
data
experts
say
in
the
aftermath
of
last
weekend's
massacres
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
a
number
of
policy
proposals
burst
forth
including
many
ideas
familiar
from
earlier
mass
shootings
like
increased
background
checks
and
closing
existing
loopholes
but
some
proposed
policies
were
new
suggesting
this
could
be
watershed
moment
for
meaningful
action
in
addition
to
gun-safety
laws
experts
tell
thinkprogress
this
is
a
moment
to
renew
focus
on
a
comprehensive
response
to
white
nationalist
and
far-right
terror
as
the
washington
post
reported
some
policy
recommendations
being
advanced
center
on
a
realignment
of
national
security
priorities
as
violence
on
the
far
right
escalates
others
echo
the
u.s.
response
to
the
sept
attacks
including
increased
monitoring
of
propaganda
networks
we
call
on
our
government
to
make
addressing
this
form
of
terrorism
as
high
a
priority
as
countering
international
terrorism
has
become
since
and
to
provide
the
type
of
leadership
and
strategic
guidance
on
this
issue
promised
in
the
counter-terrorism
strategy
released
almost
a
year
ago
read
a
statement
from
a
number
of
former
national
security
council
officers
this
also
means
providing
a
significant
infusion
of
resources
to
support
federal
state
and
local
programs
aimed
at
preventing
extremism
and
targeted
violence
of
any
kind
motivated
by
any
ideology
or
directed
at
any
american
community
not
everyone
is
necessarily
on
board
with
mirroring
the
post-
approach
the
u.s.
pursued
however
for
those
who
have
been
tracking
the
far-right
for
years
and
tried
to
call
attention
to
the
far-right's
spiraling
threat
there
are
quicker
simpler
fixes
than
can
be
addressed
before
any
major
pieces
of
legislation
or
new
strategy
come
to
the
fore
for
heidi
beirich
director
of
the
southern
poverty
law
center's
intelligence
project
the
first
legislative
response
should
focus
primarily
on
data
about
how
many
far-right
threats
exist
and
what
the
threats
actually
comprise
the
united
states
needs
to
attempt
to
get
that
data
before
anybody
from
our
perspective
flies
off
the
cuff
and
all
of
a
sudden
declares
things
domestic
terrorist
organizations
beirich
told
thinkprogress
we
don't
want
to
go
back
to
what
happened
after
with
the
muslim
community
and
the
u.s.
government
has
a
terrible
history
of
using
spying
against
political
opponents
two
of
the
easiest
means
of
data
collection
beirich
added
are
contained
in
a
pair
of
bills
currently
circulating
around
congress
one
the
domestic
terrorism
documentation
and
analysis
of
threats
in
america
data
act
was
introduced
last
summer
by
house
homeland
security
committee
chair
bennie
thompson
d-ms
the
data
act
would
require
a
number
of
federal
agencies
including
the
fbi
department
of
homeland
security
and
justice
department
to
issue
a
formal
report
on
domestic
terrorism
including
information
on
prosecutions
convictions
and
investigations
the
bill
would
also
establish
a
dhs
university-based
research
center
to
both
study
domestic
terrorism
and
publish
a
database
related
to
domestic
terrorist
incidents
there's
an
urgent
need
for
robust
centralized
and
transparent
federal
data
to
inform
counterterrorism
policymaking
and
americans
deserve
to
know
exactly
how
their
government
is
allocating
resources
to
understanding
and
confronting
the
scourge
of
domestic
terrorism
thompson
said
when
announcing
his
bill
noting
the
recent
spike
in
deaths
attributed
to
domestic
terrorists
likewise
beirich
noted
congress
should
pass
the
stop
harmful
and
abusive
telecommunications
expression
act
stop
hate
act
a
complementary
piece
of
legislation
that
would
identify
how
social
media
and
online
forums
have
accelerate
the
spread
of
hate
speech
and
white
supremacist
ideology
with
bills
in
both
the
house
and
senate
the
legislation
took
on
a
renewed
salience
in
the
aftermath
of
the
el
paso
shooting
after
the
alleged
gunman
posted
his
manifesto
to
chan
one
of
the
most
notoriously
extremist
sites
a
number
of
presidential
candidates
co-sponsored
the
senate
legislation
including
sen
kamala
harris
d-ca
sen
cory
booker
d-nj
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
the
bill
mirrors
other
efforts
at
data
collection
which
had
previously
stalled
out
due
to
lack
of
republican
support
of
course
data
collection
is
only
one
step
albeit
one
of
monumental
importance
while
federal
and
state
authorities
continue
to
compile
data
to
better
allocate
resources
moving
forward
the
united
states
should
pursue
a
number
of
other
relatively
easy
policy
shifts
for
instance
the
trump
administration
should
reverse
its
decision
to
end
an
obama-era
program
dedicated
to
countering
domestic
terror
as
thinkprogress
previous
reported
the
trump
administration
revealed
last
year
that
it
would
not
renew
the
countering
violent
extremism
grant
program
a
dhs
initiative
launched
in
the
federal
grant
program
was
dedicated
solely
to
combating
far-right
extremist
groups
and
ideologies
that
is
until
the
white
house
decided
in
it
wasn't
worth
funding
there
are
symbolic
steps
congress
can
take
to
illustrate
its
opposition
to
the
kind
of
far-right
ideologies
the
president
continues
to
peddle
congress
can
finally
end
its
century-long
struggle
to
enact
anti-lynching
legislation
while
lynchings
haven't
occurred
in
the
united
states
in
decades
congress
has
failed
time
and
again
to
pass
legislation
making
lynching
a
federal
crime
thankfully
there
has
been
recent
momentum
on
that
front
earlier
this
year
the
senate
passed
bipartisan
anti-lynching
legislation
sponsored
by
a
number
of
candidates
including
harris
the
house
version
of
the
bill
has
also
been
moving
forward
and
just
last
week
was
referred
to
the
house
subcommittee
on
crime
terrorism
and
homeland
security
while
the
bill
wouldn't
have
necessarily
deterred
the
type
of
white
supremacist
massacre
that
took
place
in
el
paso
it
would
nevertheless
present
a
strong
signal
that
the
federal
government
remains
opposes
violent
white
nationalist
rhetoric
whether
any
of
this
legislation
is
passed
of
course
remains
to
be
seen
but
as
beirich
noted
and
as
the
responses
have
already
illustrated
the
recent
mass
shootings
feel
qualitatively
different
from
previous
ones
and
more
like
a
sea-change
in
terms
of
how
the
washington
might
finally
respond
to
the
threat
of
far-right
terrorism
you
just
can't
act
like
this
isn't
a
problem
anymore
she
said
that's
what
i
see
as
different
