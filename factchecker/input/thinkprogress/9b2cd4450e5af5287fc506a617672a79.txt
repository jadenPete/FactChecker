it's
not
just
larry
nassar
michigan
state
university
has
a
problem
with
rape
culture
just
look
at
what's
happened
the
last
two
weeks
it's
been
months
since
the
sentencing
hearing
of
former
michigan
state
and
usa
gymnastics
doctor
larry
nassar
when
hundreds
of
his
sexual
abuse
victims
and
their
family
members
confronted
him
with
victim-impact
statements
detailing
for
the
world
the
extent
of
his
crimes
and
shining
a
light
on
the
people
who
allowed
his
abuse
to
go
unpunished
for
decades
but
even
though
nassar
is
behind
bars
rape
culture
still
persists
at
michigan
state
university
after
nassar's
first
sentencing
hearing
last
january
and
under
a
hailstorm
of
public
pressure
former
msu
president
lou
anna
k.
simon
resigned
that
was
supposed
to
signal
a
bright
new
day
for
the
beleaguered
school
a
new
era
in
which
survivors
would
be
listened
to
and
the
enabling
of
sexual
abuse
would
be
discouraged
the
day
after
simon
stepped
down
former
michigan
governor
john
engler
was
named
the
interim
president
he
turned
out
to
be
even
worse
he
once
told
a
reporter
that
nassar
survivors
were
enjoying
the
spotlight
he
was
forced
to
resign
soon
thereafter
in
january
of
this
year
the
new
msu
president
samuel
l.
stanley
officially
started
the
job
at
the
beginning
of
this
month
he
said
in
june
soon
after
he
was
hired
that
there
was
healing
beginning
to
take
place
on
campus
but
nassar
enablers
are
still
on
the
payroll
university
officials
are
showing
up
to
offer
public
support
to
a
man
once
charged
with
sexual
assault
and
a
judge
ruled
that
it
is
plausible
that
msu
purposefully
buried
sexual
assault
claims
against
athletes
and
all
of
this
news
came
out
in
the
last
two
weeks
alone
earlier
this
month
the
lansing
state
journal
reported
that
david
jager
a
year-old
athletic
trainer
for
michigan
state
football
has
been
charged
of
attempted
sexual
assault
domestic
violence
and
lying
to
a
police
officer
the
journal
reports
that
jager
is
accused
of
assaulting
his
girlfriend
at
spartan
stadium
in
august
and
lying
about
it
and
charged
with
attempting
to
sexually
assault
a
different
woman
in
lansing
in
february
the
former
two
charges
are
misdemeanors
while
the
latter
is
a
felony
meaning
he
faces
up
to
years
in
prison
if
convicted
jager
is
one
of
msu
employees
now
known
to
have
had
information
about
allegations
of
sexual
abuse
against
nassar
before
they
became
public
knowledge
but
failed
to
report
them
according
to
a
report
by
the
michigan
attorney
general
released
last
december
in
jager's
girlfriend
told
him
that
nassar
groped
her
but
jager
told
her
that
nassar
had
a
great
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
and
told
her
to
file
a
report
if
she
felt
uncomfortable
msu
spokesperson
emily
guerrant
told
the
journal
that
jager
has
been
on
paid
administrative
leave
since
march
though
she
didn't
specify
a
reason
for
the
leave
so
that
means
that
jager
didn't
report
allegations
of
abuse
against
nassar
and
is
facing
his
own
allegations
of
domestic
violence
and
sexual
assault
but
is
still
collecting
a
paycheck
from
the
university
then
just
last
week
former
msu
basketball
star
mateen
cleaves
was
on
trial
for
sexual
assault
charges
there
was
a
video
of
cleaves
dragging
a
nearly-naked
woman
back
into
a
hotel
room
twice
as
she
struggled
against
him
and
yelled
help
me
help
me
help
me
a
jury
acquitted
cleaves
on
all
charges
on
the
final
day
of
the
trial
michigan
state
men's
basketball
coach
tom
izzo
came
to
the
court
room
to
support
cleaves
on
twitter
rachael
denhollander
the
first
survivor
to
come
forward
and
publicly
accuse
nassar
of
sexual
abuse
reflected
on
the
message
that
izzo's
appearance
sent
apparently
msu
officials
can
make
it
to
court
in
sex
abuse
cases
not
on
behalf
of
the
victims
though
denhollander
wrote
the
day
i
gave
my
impact
statement
msu
was
in
court
down
the
street
asking
to
dismiss
our
cases
when
you
show
up
who
you
show
up
for
matters
just
one
day
after
the
cleaves
ruling
a
judge
across
town
issued
another
significant
verdict
in
a
sexual
assault
case
involving
msu
athletics
last
year
year-old
bailey
kowalski
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
the
school
arguing
that
it
had
violated
her
rights
under
title
ix
by
mishandling
her
sexual
misconduct
complaint
against
three
msu
basketball
players
in
according
to
her
lawsuit
kowalski
met
some
msu
basketball
players
at
a
bar
and
was
invited
back
to
an
off-campus
apartment
for
a
party
to
celebrate
the
team's
recent
final
four
appearance
at
the
apartment
she
says
three
players
took
turns
raping
her
when
she
went
to
the
msu
counseling
center
about
a
week
later
she
told
a
staff
member
that
her
assailants
were
basketball
players
and
was
told
if
you
pursue
this
you
are
going
to
be
swimming
with
some
really
big
fish
kowalski
argues
that
her
treatment
was
part
of
a
larger
pattern
of
msu
officials
seeking
to
cover
up
sexual
assault
complaints
against
athletes
michigan
state
fought
to
get
the
case
dismissed
but
just
last
week
judge
paul
maloney
ruled
that
the
case
could
continue
to
discovery
the
court
finds
that
the
allegations
in
plaintiff's
complaint
render
plausible
her
claim
that
msu
maintained
official
policies
that
left
her
and
other
female
students
vulnerable
to
sexual
assault
by
male
athletes
maloney
said
in
his
ruling
plaintiff
has
sufficiently
pleaded
that
msu
allowed
reports
of
sexual
assault
to
be
handled
off-line
by
the
athletic
department
and
outside
the
normal
channels
of
title
ix
investigations
similarly
the
attempts
to
cover
up
or
otherwise
obfuscate
the
university's
handling
of
sexual
assault
reports
made
against
male
athletes
the
attempts
to
conceal
the
names
of
prominent
male
athletes
when
mentioned
in
police
reports
and
the
attempts
to
discourage
female
victims
from
reporting
their
own
assaults
all
tend
to
show
that
sexual
assaults
by
male
athletes
were
handled
in
ways
that
would
minimize
scrutiny
and
potential
punishment
for
such
acts
meanwhile
michigan
state
has
not
been
cooperating
with
the
state's
attorney
general's
investigation
into
the
school's
mishandling
of
sexual
assault
complaints
including
those
against
nassar
the
michigan
state
board
of
trustees
has
repeatedly
declined
to
turn
over
privileged
information
to
investigators
and
to
top
things
off
when
former
president
lou
anna
k.
simon
formally
announced
her
retirement
this
summer
the
school
made
a
deal
to
pay
her
million
over
three
years
provide
her
medical
and
dental
coverage
give
her
the
title
of
president
emeritus
and
provide
her
with
continued
access
to
football
and
basketball
tickets
simon
was
the
head
of
the
university
as
one
of
the
biggest
sexual
abuse
scandals
in
u.s.
sports
history
and
a
related
coverup
unfolded
on
her
campus
right
under
her
nose
her
failures
in
office
allowed
the
abuse
to
persist
for
decades
she
currently
faces
two
felonies
for
lying
to
the
police
about
what
she
knew
about
nassar's
crimes
as
survivors
and
advocates
at
msu
keep
working
towards
healing
those
in
charge
are
working
harder
to
make
sure
the
bleeding
continues
update
late
on
monday
night
michigan
state's
lawyers
filed
a
page
motion
accompanied
by
pages
of
exhibits
seeking
to
dismiss
lawsuits
representing
more
than
nassar
survivors
according
to
the
detroit
free
press
the
motion
argued
that
while
nassar
deserved
to
be
punished
for
his
crimes
michigan
state
was
not
liable
although
nassar's
actions
were
repugnant
and
merit
the
heavy
criminal
penalties
imposed
upon
him
the
law
does
not
support
plaintiffs
attempts
to
hold
the
msu
defendants
liable
for
his
wrongs
the
university
said
