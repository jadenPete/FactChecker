the
stunning
hypocrisy
of
the
republican
senators
who
just
voted
against
the
budget
deal
now
they
say
they
care
about
the
debt
the
senate
passed
a
two-year
budget
agreement
on
thursday
sending
the
bipartisan
legislation
to
president
donald
trump's
desk
the
agreement
includes
a
suspension
of
the
debt
ceiling
until
after
the
november
elections
despite
trump's
stated
support
for
the
deal
and
his
previous
urging
of
the
republicans
in
the
senate
voted
against
the
deal

tom

d-de
amy
klobuchar

joe
manchin
d-wv
and
jon

also
voted
nay
the
common
refrain
from
those
republicans
voting
no
on
thursday
was
that
while
they
liked
the
bill's
increases
in
defense
spending
they
were
concerned
that
it
did
not
do
enough
to
address
the
trump
administration's
all-time
record
budget
deficit
and
national
debt
but
a
large
reason
for
the
nation's
projected
trillion
dollar
annual
deficit
in
is
that
two
years
ago
the
republican
congress
passed
the
so-called
tax
cut
and
jobs
act
a
massive
tax
cut
that
mostly
benefited
the
wealthiest
americans
and
corporations
though
the
bill's
supporters
claimed
it
would
pay
for
itself
with
economic
growth
even
its
main
author
now
admits
that
was
not
true
as
trump
repeatedly
touts
the
greatest
economy
ever
revenues
are
down
since
its
enactment
the
cost
of
the
tax
cuts
is
estimated
to
be
in
the
trillions
over
a
decade

voting

the

rick

blackburn
said
she
cannot
in
good
conscience
support
legislation
that
funds
the
government
at
the
expense
of
adding
to
our
national

blackburn
