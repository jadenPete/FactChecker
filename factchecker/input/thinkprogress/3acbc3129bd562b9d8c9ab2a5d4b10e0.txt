trump
is
trying
to
kill
electric
cars
but
will
kill
jobs
and
the
climate
instead
the
global
electric
car
boom
can't
be
stopped
but
trump
policies
would
insure
u.s.
workers
miss
out
on
it
two
new
analyses
from
bloomberg
this
week
make
clear
just
how
bad
president
donald
trump's
policies
are
for
the
domestic
electric
car
market
and
u.s.
workers
in
the
first
report
bloomberg
new
energy
finance
bnef
explains
that
trump's
plan
to
roll
back
obama-era
fuel
efficiency
and
emissions
standards
for
vehicles
would
eliminate
any
federal
requirement
for
carmakers
to
build
electric
vehicles
evs
bnef
also
explains
that
the
deal
ford
honda
volkswagen
and
bmw
struck
with
california
last
week
to
avoid
the
full
rollback
will
not
undo
most
of
the
damage
in
the
second
bnef
concluded
that
the
rapid
price
drops
in
the
cost
of
batteries
that
have
driven
the
energy
storage
and
ev
revolutions
this
decade
will
continue
for
the
next
decade
in
short
while
trump
can
slow
adoption
of
high-efficiency
evs
in
the
united
states
other
countries
the
e.u.
and
especially
china
will
simply
keep
adopting
them
so
quickly
that
he
cannot
stop
the
global
ev
revolution
trump's
pro-oil
moves
ensure
only
that
u.s.
companies
and
workers
are
far
less
likely
to
be
the
major
beneficiaries
of
this
massive
job-creating
revolution
since
his
election
trump
has
been
working
overtime
to
pay
back
his
big
oil
backers
who
have
been
major
donors
both
to
his
campaign
and
to
the
republican
party
not
only
has
he
been
pushing
expanded
drilling
for
climate-destroying
fossil
fuels
but
he
has
also
embraced
policies
that
would
increase
u.s.
dependency
on
oil
trump's
biggest
effort
to
date
is
his
plan
to
roll
back
president
barack
obama's
fuel
economy
and
greenhouse
gas
standards
for
new
cars
that
rollback
would
cost
consumers
nearly
billion
dollars
in
missed
fuel
savings
a
net
cost
to
individual
car
buyers
of
each
even
after
accounting
for
the
higher
vehicle
cost
as
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
concluded
in
its
final
january
determination
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
standards
rolling
back
the
standards
would
also
boost
u.s.
oil
consumption
by
a
stunning
billion
gallons
over
the
lifetime
of
the
model-year
cars
it
would
also
increase
u.s.
carbon
pollution
by
billion
tons
over
that
time
period
but
the
epa
didn't
look
at
the
impact
on
cars
built
after
that
would
also
be
subject
to
the
weaker
standards
so
we
don't
know
the
full
scale
of
the
negative
impact
of
trump's
efforts
and
while
the
car
companies
themselves
asked
for
relief
from
the
deal
they
had
made
with
the
obama
administration
the
bad
publicity
surrounding
the
full
trump
rollback
led
many
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
california
that
preserved
some
of
the
benefits
california
has
long
held
a
waiver
giving
it
the
ability
to
set
its
own
tougher
fuel
efficiency
standards
and
since
the
state
has
such
a
huge
car-centric
economy
these
tougher
standards
have
forced
car
companies
to
meet
the
state's
standards
at
the
same
time
over
a
dozen
other
states
now
use
california's
standards
according
to
bnef
if
california's
new
standards
were
adopted
nationally
it
would
require
around
half
the
ev
sales
share
to
close
the
gap
between
automakers
performance
and
their
targets
compared
to
obama's
original
standards
but
most
states
don't
use
the
california
standards
so
they
would
use
trump's
instead
which
requires
no
ev
sales
and
that
means
the
total
impact
of
the
california
standards
would
be
to
restore
far
less
than
half
the
ev
sales
that
the
obama
standard
required
trump's
policies
are
therefore
doubly
tragic
first
his
lower
standards
mean
much
higher
carbon
pollution
in
this
country
second
the
ev
revolution
is
unstoppable
globally
so
throttling
back
the
national
ev
market
merely
leaves
u.s.
car
companies
and
workers
lagging
behind
in
the
most
important
vehicle
revolution
in
a
century
according
to
bnef
from
through
the
average
lithium-ion
battery
pack
dropped
a
remarkable
in
price
and
they
predict
a
further
halving
of
lithium-ion
battery
costs
per
kilowatt-hour
by
as
demand
takes
off
in
two
different
markets
stationary
storage
and
electric
vehicles
electric
vehicle
sales
are
now
seriously
eating
into
internal
combustion
engine
ice
vehicle
sales
and
that
trend
is
projected
to
accelerate
in
the
coming
years
no
wonder
countries
like
china
are
investing
so
heavily
in
evs
and
putting
in
place
much
stronger
fuel
efficiency
standards
and
ev
requirements
but
just
as
trump
looks
backward
in
his
efforts
to
promote
the
climate-destroying
fuels
of
the
twentieth
century
he
also
looks
backward
to
promote
the
inefficient
highly
polluting
internal
combustion
engine
cars
of
the
last
century
that's
why
killing
electric
cars
will
serve
only
to
kill
u.s.
jobs
and
the
climate
