orders
georgia
to
get
rid
of
outdated
voting
machines
before
election
if
not
the
state
must
be
prepared
to
issue
paper
ballots
a
federal
judge
on
thursday
ordered
the
state
of
georgia
to
stop
using
paperless
touchscreen
voting
machines
ahead
of
the
election
citing
security
concerns
in
a
page
ruling
u.s.
district
judge
amy
totenberg
said
that
hand-marked
paper
ballots
must
be
used
if
a
new
system
isn't
in
place
by
next
year's
presidential
primaries
election
integrity
advocates
argued
in
a
lawsuit
that
paperless
touchscreen
voting
machines
in
use
since
were
vulnerable
to
hacking
and
could
not
be
audited
however
in
a
decision
issued
last
year
totenberg
determined
that
switching
to
a
paper
ballot
system
for
the
and
elections
would
have
proved
to
be
too
complicated
logistically
the
older
machines
have
been
described
by
the
judge
as
unsecure
unreliable
and
grossly
outdated
technology
and
will
be
used
one
last
time
in
for
the
statewide
municipal
and
county
elections
scheduled
for
november
the
court
remains
concerned
based
upon
the
entirety
of
the
record
evidence
about
the
state's
capacity
to
manage
a
transition
to
paper
ballots
for
the
elections
while
overseeing
and
undergoing
a
simultaneous
transition
to
the
newly
enacted
voting
system
during
this
time
totenberg
wrote
in
her
order
on
thursday
in
late
july
georgia's
secretary
of
state
brad
raffensperger
announced
the
state's
new
elections
vendor
will
be
dominion
voting
systems
the
newer
touchscreen
machines
will
print
a
paper
ballot
that
includes
a
summary
of
the
voter's
selection
plus
a
qr
code
that
is
scanned
and

the

will
be
in
place
by
the
time
the
presidential
primary
rolls
around
in
march
the
integrity
of
georgia's
voting
system
came
into
question
last
year
during
the
midterm
elections
republican
brian
kemp
georgia's
secretary
of
state
and
the
state's
chief
elections
officer
narrowly
defeated
democrat
stacey
abrams
in
the
gubernatorial
race
which
was
plagued
with
voting
issues
not
only
did
kemp
as
secretary
of
state
oversee
that
election
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
but
he
also
oversaw
a
major
voter
roll
purge
which
led
to
tens
of
thousands
of
citizens
losing
their
right
to
vote
ahead
of
the
election
for
inconsequential
reasons
the
move
was
seen
by
critics
as
a
way
to
disenfranchise
a
large
bloc
of
mostly
minority
voters
abrams
has
spent
the
majority
of
her
post-election
career
dedicated
to
voting
rights
and
election
security
in
the
state
