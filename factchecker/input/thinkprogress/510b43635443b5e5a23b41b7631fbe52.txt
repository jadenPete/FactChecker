five
democratic
senators
just
declared
all-out
war
on
the
supreme
court
what
goes
around
comes
around
a
tone
of
ritualized
obsequiousness
pervades
most
briefs
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
judges
are
powerful
and
at
the
supreme
court
level
unaccountable
they
wield
enormous
arbitrary
power
not
just
over
litigants
but
over
the
lawyers
who
appear
in
their
courtrooms
so
when
most
lawyers
speak
to
a
court
they
speak
with
a
painful
awareness
of
the
arbitrary
control
separating
the
bar
from
the
bench
sen
sheldon
whitehouse
d-ri
however
is
not
most
lawyers
whitehouse
is
one
of
five
senators
the
others
are
sens
mazie
hirono
d-hi
richard
blumenthal
d-ct
dick
durbin
d-il
and
kirsten
gillibrand
d-ny
who
filed
a
brief
earlier
this
week
in
a
second
amendment
case
the
supreme
court's
republican
majority
could
use
to
dismantle
what
remains
of
america's
gun
regulations
whitehouse
is
also
the
lead
and
only
counsel
on
the
brief
the
brief
itself
is
less
a
legal
document
than
a
declaration
of
war
though
parts
of
it
argue
that
the
high
court
lacks
jurisdiction
over
this
case
new
york
state
rifle
pistol
association
v
city
of
new
york
the
thrust
of
the
brief
is
that
the
supreme
court
is
dominated
by
political
hacks
selected
by
the
federalist
society
and
promoted
by
the
national
rifle
association
and
that
if
those
hacks
don't
watch
out
the
american
people
are
going
to
rebel
against
them
seriously
new

state
rifle
whitehouse
writes
did
not
emerge
from
a
vacuum
rather
the
lead
petitioner's
parent
organization
the
national
rifle
association
nra
promoted
the
confirmation
and
perhaps
selection
of
nominees
to
this
court
who
it
believed
would
break
the
tie
in
second
amendment
cases
that
promotional
effort
includes
million
whitehouse
says
the
nra
spent
on
television
advertisements
supporting
the
confirmation
of
brett
kavanaugh
similarly
whitehouse
writes
that
the
federalist
society's
executive
vice
president
leonard
leo
has
been
linked
to
a
million-dollar
contribution
to
the
nra's
lobbying
arm
and
to
a
million
network
largely
funded
by
anonymous
donors
to
promote
right-wing
causes
and
judicial
nominees
having
portrayed
the
court's
republican
majority
as
the
product
of
shady
interest
groups
and
big
spenders
whitehouse
then
paints
these
insiders
as
enemies
of
an
american
consensus
complete
with
quotations
from
a
recent
poll
and
whitehouse
concludes
the
brief
with
a
threat
the
supreme
court
is
not
well
he
writes
and
the
people
know
it
perhaps
the
court
can
heal
itself
before
the
public
demands
it
be
restructured
in
order
to
reduce
the
influence
of
politics
this
is
to
say
the
least
not
the
sort
of
argument
lawyers
typically
present
to
a
court
judicial
legitimacy
flows
from
the
myth
that
judges
are
above
politics
lawyers
normally
take
care
not
to
question
that
myth
because
they
do
not
want
to
anger
a
judge
and
because
a
lawyer's
own
ability
to
make
a
living
flows
from
their
client's
belief
that
law
exists
separately
from
politics
but
as
the
polling
cited
by
whitehouse
demonstrates
the
myth
of
the
politically
agnostic
court
is
collapsing
fast
here's
an
telling
example
a
review
of
obamacare
cases
by
the
conservative
washington
times
found
that
democratic
appointees
ruled
in
favor
of
obamacare
more
than
percent
of
the
time
while
republican
appointees
ruled
against
it
nearly
percent
of
the
time
in
cases
involving
america's
most
politically
charged
law
in
other
words
the
best
predictor
of
a
judge's
vote
isn't
some
abstract
question
about
judicial
philosophy
it's
whether
the
judge
is
a
democrat
or
a
republican
simply
put
there's
a
reason
why
senate
republicans
held
a
seat
on
the
supreme
court
open
for
more
than
a
year
until
a
republican
president
could
fill
it
partisan
control
matters
a
great
deal
it's
the
difference
between
a
constitutional
ban
on
gerrymandering
and
the
decision
the
republican
majority
handed
down
last
june
which
held
that
partisan
gerrymandering
cannot
be
questioned
by
federal
judges
it's
the
difference
between
a
robust
voting
rights
act
and
skeletal
voting-rights
protections
picked
clean
by
the
supreme
court
and
as
whitehouse
correctly
notes
it's
the
difference
between
a
nation
that
can
keep
deadly
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
murderers
and
a
nation
where
guns
are
largely
unregulated
the
whitehouse
brief
provoked
predictable
outrage
from
conservative
outlets
the
national
review's
david
french
calls
it
the
most
malicious
supreme
court
brief
i've
ever
seen
the
brief
is
so
outside
legal
norms
french
claims
that
had
i
drafted
it
as
a
member
of
the
supreme
court
bar
i'd
be
concerned
about
facing
legal
sanction
for
recklessly
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
court
perhaps
but
you
know
what
was
also
outside
of
legal
norms
a
sitting
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
angrily
confronting
senators
who
credibly
accused
him
of
trying
to
rape
christine
blasey
ford
and
then
threatening
revenge
against
those
senate
democrats
the
whitehouse
brief
is
best
read
as
several
prominent
democrats
response
to
what
goes
around
comes
around
the
decision
to
lock
supreme
court
nominee
merrick
garland
out
of
the
high
court
and
the
decisions
to
muscle
judges
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh
onto
that
court
are
the
kind
of
tactics
that
exposes
the
molten
core
of
partisan
politics
at
the
heart
of
the
supreme
court's
high-minded
rhetoric
neither
gorsuch
nor
kavanuagh
moreover
possesses
even
the
second-hand
democratic
legitimacy
that
normally
attaches
to
presidential
appointees
both
men
were
nominated
by
a
president
who
lost
the
popular
vote
and
were
confirmed
by
a
bloc
of
senators
who
represent
less
than
half
of
the
country
the
judiciary
alexander
hamilton
wrote
in
the
federalist
papers
has
no
influence
over
either
the
sword
or
the
purse
no
direction
either
of
the
strength
or
of
the
wealth
of
the
society
and
can
take
no
active
resolution
whatever
its
power
flows
entirely
from
the
widespread
sense
that
its
decisions
are
legitimate
courts
may
truly
be
said
to
have
neither
force
nor
will
but
merely
judgment
and
must
ultimately
depend
upon
the
aid
of
the
executive
arm
even
for
the
efficacy
of
its
judgments
in
other
words
republicans
may
come
to
find
that
by
seizing
control
of
the
judiciary
through
constitutional
hardball
they
did
so
much
damage
to
their
prize
that
it
is
no
longer
worth
having
the
whitehouse
brief
is
an
early
warning
sign
that
democratic
elected
officials
are
at
the
very
least
ambivalent
about
whether
they
should
obey
courts
that
are
increasingly
seen
as
illegitimate
if
those
courts
push
too
hard
that
ambivalence
could
harden
into
something
that
will
do
permanent
damage
to
judicial
power
