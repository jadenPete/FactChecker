james
allsup
the
washington-based
white
supremacist
has
also
been
demonetized
by
youtube
though
his
account
remains
up
facebook
and
instagram
suspended
the
accounts
of
year-old
white
supremacist
james
allsup
last
week
the
latest
move
to
tamp
down
fascistic
language
spreading
across
the
platforms
in
recent
years
thinkprogress
first
discovered
that
allsup's
accounts
were
unavailable
during
a
search
of
both
social
media
sites
over
the
weekend
allsup
also
confirmed
he'd
been
suspended
in
a
video
last
tuesday
the
move
follows
a
similar
decision
from
uber
and
from
twitter
which
suspended
allsup's
account
in
late
allsup's
youtube
account
which
currently
has
over
followers
remains
up
however
according
to
allsup
it
has
been
demonetized
meaning
that
his
videos
can
no
longer
generate
revenue
via
ads
on
youtube
his
videos
will
no
longer
be
recommended
according
to
allsup
the
move
to
demonetize
his
videos
has
led
to
a
significant
financial
hit
a
spokesperson
for
facebook
told
thinkprogress
that
they
removed
allsup's
accounts
for
violating
our
policies
against
dangerous
organizations
and
individuals
google
which
oversees
youtube
did
not
respond
to
thinkprogress
requests
for
comment
on
the
matter
the
suspension
and
demonetization
is
the
latest
embarrassment
for
the
washington
state-based
white
supremacist
after
being
elected
as
a
precinct
committee
officer
in
washington's
whitman
county
last
year
a
position
for
which
allsup
ran
unopposed
the
whitman
county
republican
central
committee
voted
unanimously
in
january
to
boot
allsup
from
its
ranks
while
he
retains
his
technical
title
as
precinct
officer
he
has
been
stripped
of
any
actual
powers
that
come
with
the
position
allsup's
white
supremacist
beliefs
aren't
difficult
to
discern
he
not
only
marched
alongside
a
pro-white
group
in
the
deadly
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
but
as
the
anti-defamation
league
adl
wrote
earlier
in
august
he
has
since
spoken
at
several
white
supremacist
conferences
as
well
allsup
has
also
claimed
membership
with
the
white
supremacist
identity
evropa
group
encouraging
other
members
of
the
group
to
join
local
republican
party
institutions
allsup
is
a
former
head
of
washington
state
university's
college
republican
chapter
the
move
comes
in
the
aftermath
of
america's
deadliest
anti-immigrant
terror
attack
in
years
in
el
paso
texas
despite
this
numerous
white
supremacist
channels
like
allsup's
remain
up
on
youtube
even
after
the
company
issued
an
update
to
its
policies
in
june
stating
specifically
that
it
would
prohibit
white
supremacist
ideologies
on
its
platform
as
the
adl
wrote
last
week
a
significant
number
of
channels
on
youtube's
platform
continue
to
disseminate
anti-semitic
and
white
supremacist
content
even
after
the
policy
update
allsup's
channel
was
included
in
its
list
of
examples
