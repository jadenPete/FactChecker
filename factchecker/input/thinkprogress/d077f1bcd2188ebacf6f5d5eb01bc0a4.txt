thanks
to
mitch
mcconnell
u.s.
now
has
no
functioning
election
commission
the
federal
election
commission
will
be
without
a
quorum
as
of
august
and
will
be
powerless
to
enforce
election
law
the
federal
election
commission
fec
intended
to
be
a
group
of
no
more
than
three
democrats
and
no
more
than
three
republicans
overseeing
the
federal
campaign
finance
system
has
been
operating
with
just
a
bare
quorum
of
four
for
the
past
months
with
the
resignation
of
vice
chairman
matthew
petersen
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
commission
will
be
virtually
paralyzed
the
reason
for
this
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
and
his
republican-controlled
u.s.
senate
the
fec
is
a
peculiar
agency
it
was
created
in
to
enforce
finance
laws
for
house
senate
presidential
and
vice
presidential
campaigns
unlike
most
agencies
neither
party
is
allowed
to
hold
a
working
majority
of
seats
at
any
time
scott
harshbarger
the
former
president
of
the
campaign
finance
reform
group
common
cause
once
quipped
that
the
fec
is
probably
the
only
agency
in
washington
that
has
done
from
the
beginning
exactly
what
it
was
intended
to
do
which
was
to
do
nothing
but
while
the
commission
has
often
deadlocked
along
party
lines
especially
in
recent
years
it
still
has
played
some
role
in
issuing
fines
auditing
campaign
filings
and
investigating
corruption
with
just
three
active
members
it
will
be
able
to
do
none
of
that
the
six
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
president
subject
to
senate
confirmation
to
serve
a
single
six-year
term
the
terms
are
staggered
so
two
typically
one
democratic
and
one
republican
commissioner
are
up
every
two
years
if
no
successor
is
confirmed
commissioners
may
stay
on
as
long
as
they
are
willing
while
the
positions
were
once
filled
in
pairs
with
little
fanfare
since
mcconnell
an
avowed
foe
of
campaign
finance
law
became
majority
leader
in
not
a
single
commissioner
has
been
confirmed
petersen
and
the
remaining
commissioners
are
all
serving
expired
terms
president
donald
trump
has
made
little
effort
to
appoint
new
commissioners
since
taking
office
but
the
one
nomination
he
has
made
pro-trump
attorney
trey
trainor
of
texas
has
been
waiting
for
a
confirmation
hearing
since
september
mcconnell
has
dubbed
himself
the
grim
reaper
blocking
virtually
all
legislative
action
in
the
united
states
senate
and
focusing
almost
exclusively
on
confirming
trump's
nominees
but
the
federal
election
commission
has
been
a
notable
exception
back
in
president
barack
obama's
first
nominee
to
the
federal
election
commission
john
j.
sullivan
withdrew
from
consideration
despite
strong
bipartisan
support
after
waiting
more
than
a
year
for
a
vote
in
the
full
senate
two
senators
demanded
that
other
expired
seats
be
filled
at
the
time
but
this
did
not
happen
due
to
lack
of
agreement
from
then-minority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
