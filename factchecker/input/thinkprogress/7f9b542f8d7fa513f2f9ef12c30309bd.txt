trump
imposes
more
tariffs
on
china
but
he's
out
of
ideas
now
china
holds
the
cards
fed
up
with
lack
of
progress
in
trade
talks
trump
slap
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
imports
president
donald
trump
on
thursday
tweeted
that
he
would
apply
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
trade
talks
are
continuing
and
during
the
talks
the
u.s.
will
start
on
september
st
putting
a
small
additional
tariff
of
on
the
remaining
billion
dollars
of
goods
and
products
coming
from
china
into
our
country
this
does
not
include
the
billion
dollars
already
tariffed
at
the
president
wrote
in
a
series
of
tweets
but
while
the
white
house
described
this
week's
trade
talks
between
the
u.s.
and
china
as
constructive
little
progress
was
made
earlier
in
the
day
the
president
tweeted
that
countries
such
as
iran
and
china
both
embroiled
in
heated
diplomatic
contretemps
with
the
u.s.
iran
over
the
nuclear
deal
trump
violated
and
the
sanctions
he
subsequently
imposed
and
china
over
trade
are
hoping
he
doesn't
get
reelected
in
china
still
wants
the
united
states
to
lift
the
tariffs
the
white
house
placed
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
but
the
u.s.
is
not
budging
insisting
that
china
take
a
number
of
steps
first
including
opening
its
markets
to
u.s.
business
and
stopping
the
forced
transfer
of
technology
as
the
deadlock
has
dragged
on
over
the
past
year
negotiations
have
at
times
regressed
with
each
country
slapping
tariffs
on
an
increasing
number
of
categories
of
the
other's
exports
talks
finally
broke
down
entirely
in
may
that
china
might
be
hoping
to
wait
out
trump
isn't
surprising
as
the
chinese
government
has
historically
taken
the
long
view
on
most
issues
in
the
meantime
however
the
stalled
talks
and
escalation
of
tariffs
create
new
uncertainties
for
the
u.s.
economy
as
this
contentious
trade
war
persists
with
no
end
in
sight
over
time
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
a
protectionist
u.s.
grow
more
than
an
integrated
u.s.
said
scott
kennedy
director
of
the
project
on
chinese
business
and
political
economy
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
but
he
doesn't
think
the
chinese
are
stalling
because
they
fear
president
trump's
toughness
at
the
bargaining
table
my
sense
is
that
the
chinese
have
lost
interest
in
a
deal
because
they
don't
trust
the
trump
administration
any
longer
said
kennedy
and
this
drawn-out
trade
war
he
said
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
u.s.
economy
one
way
or
the
other
how
quickly
that
is
reflected
depends
on
where
you
are
in
the
economy
he
added
soybean
farmers
have
already
been
hit
for
example
whereas
consumers
will
start
paying
higher
prices
when
the
latest
round
of
tariffs
are
applied
on
chinese
goods
in
the
fall
by
kennedy's
reckoning
the
prolonged
trade
war
will
adversely
affect
business
and
consumer
confidence
in
the
united
states
piling
onto
the
collateral
damage
that
he
believes
has
been
wrought
by
the
trump
administration's
economic
nationalism
he
expects
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
world
bank
to
see
this
situation
as
a
net
negative
and
issue
estimates
in
august
on
its
impact
on
global
economic
growth
robert
e.
scott
senior
economist
and
director
of
trade
and
manufacturing
policy
research
at
the
economic
policy
institute
said
that
the
tariffs
are
a
bad
idea
i'm
not
a
fan
of
these
tariffs
there's
no
strategy
behind
it
and
it's
unlikely
to
lead
to
an
improvement
in
our
trade
relations
or
that
it's
going
to
help
workers
or
american
production
said
scott
while
he
doesn't
think
a
trade
war
that
drags
along
for
another
year
and
a
half
will
be
catastrophic
to
the
u.s.
economy
thursday's
fresh
round
of
tariffs
he
said
ups
the
ante
making
it
unclear
how
long
consumers
can
continue
to
fuel
economic
growth
it's
true
that
some
u.s.
farmers
and
manufacturers
have
already
said
that
they
are
feeling
the
pinch
with
consumers
bracing
for
price
increases
but
contrary
to
president
donald
trump's
claims
china
isn't
footing
the
bill
for
his
tariffs
american
business
owners
are
some
are
buffering
consumers
from
drastic
price
hikes
by
taking
the
hit
themselves
or
are
spending
money
moving
their
supply
chains
away
from
china
farmers
took
a
hit
at
the
start
of
the
trade
war
but
the
trump
administration
started
offering
aid
and
it
seems
is
now
over-compensating
on
some
fronts
costing
taxpayers
more
than
billion
in
and
but
scott
said
it's
not
the
trade
war
with
china
that
is
causing
most
of
this
pain
it's
a
combination
of
slowing
domestic
economic
growth
after
the
sugar
rush
of
last
year's
tax
cut
wore
off
combined
with
a
slow-down
in
global
economic
growth
that
negative
impact
of
tariffs
does
loom
larger
when
baseline
growth
is
so
low
and
tenuous
scott
cautioned
he
added
that
there
was
nothing
in
either
the
tax
or
spending
bills
that
was
going
to
rebuild
the
domestic
economy
and
generate
increased
demands
in
the
future
the
president
also
didn't
increase
spending
on
infrastructure
as
he
said
he
would
he
added
yet
president
trump's
former
economic
adviser
gary
cohn
told
the
bbc
on
thursday
that
the
trade
war
has
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
u.s.
manufacturing
sector
he
added
that
with
everything
including
credit
availability
being
controlled
by
the
state
china
has
a
better
chance
of
weathering
this
crisis
scott
points
out
that
cohn
is
basically
only
talking
about
wall
street
wall
street
is
very
dependent
on
the
state
of
the
manufacturing
sector
in
china
they
are
very
invested
in
globalization
and
offshoring
he
said
despite
president
trump's
tariffs
trade
deficits
keep
increasing
and
even
american
companies
aren't
bringing
manufacturing
jobs
back
home
from
china
instead
they're
moving
them
to
taiwan
or
vietnam
and
china
is
shipping
parts
and
components
to
those
plants
is
getting
a
deal
important
yes
do
both
countries
need
it
absolutely
however
it's
possible
that
no
trade
deal
will
solve
the
very
real
problems
the
massive
trade
deficit
and
the
forced
transfer
of
technology
for
instance
that
the
u.s.
has
with
china
china
is
the
u.s.
s
third
largest
trading
partner
and
a
huge
player
in
the
global
supply
chain
but
said
kennedy
it
is
neither
the
savior
nor
the
bane
of
the
american
economy
president
trump's
protectionism
however
is
another
matter
with
investors
looking
at
this
issue
not
strictly
through
a
perspective
of
u.s.
china
tension
but
rather
through
the
prism
of
the
global
economy
as
a
whole
the
president
has
imposed
or
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
virtually
every
major
trading
partner
canada
mexico
the
european
union
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
this
is
the
opposite
of
what
kennedy
feels
the
president
should
be
doing
which
is
to
lift
tariffs
off
allies
present
a
united
front
against
china
and
develop
new
rules
of
the
road
for
international
trade
all
in
the
service
of
creating
a
more
level
playing
field
for
global
trade
scott
however
feels
that
the
main
culprit
in
hurting
the
american
economy
is
the
over-valued
u.s.
dollar
especially
against
the
chinese
yuan
without
rebalancing
the
u.s.
dollar
trade
deficits
and
manufacturing
losses
will
continue
american
manufacturing
and
agriculture
alike
have
been
hit
by
the
strength
of
the
dollar
which
makes
prices
of
u.s.
goods
especially
farm
goods
whose
prices
are
set
on
the
global
market
uncompetitively
high
recent
floods
in
the
u.s.
and
decreased
chinese
purchases
haven't
helped
matters
nevertheless
the
u.s.
dollar's
appreciation
driven
higher
by
increased
u.s.
borrowing
is
the
biggest
culprit
said
scott
plus
china
is
happy
to
continue
to
devalue
its
currency
down
since
february
which
allows
it
to
offset
the
effects
of
the
tariffs
they
have
countered
trump's
move
and
he
doesn't
have
an
answer
said
scott
adding
that
they
are
also
waiting
for
trump
to
simply
be
voted
out
of
office
but
what
if
he's
not
kennedy
said
china
will
expect
a
bifurcated
global
economy
one
centered
around
the
u.s.
and
one
around
itself
it
will
continue
to
aggressively
develop
technology
build
trade
and
investment
partnerships
and
make
whatever
moves
it
has
at
its
disposal
to
weaken
the
u.s.
economy
they
will
see
this
as
part
of
a
broader
strategic
partnership
they
would
be
responding
very
much
in
parallel
to
what
the
u.s.
is
doing
said
kennedy
