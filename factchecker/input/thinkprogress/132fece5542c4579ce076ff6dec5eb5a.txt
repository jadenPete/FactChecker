facebook
and
twitter
crack
down
on
accounts
spreading
disinformation
about
hong
kong
protests
hundreds
of
thousands
of
accounts
believed
to
be
part
of
a
chinese-led
interference
campaign
have
been
removed
twitter
and
facebook
announced
on
monday
the
suspension
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
accounts
believed
to
be
part
of
a
massive
disinformation
campaign
by
the
chinese
government
to
sow
discord
among
pro-democracy
protesters
in
hong
kong
we
are
disclosing
a
significant
state-backed
information
operation
focused
on
the
situation
in
hong
kong
twitter
said
in
a
statement
these
accounts
were
deliberately
and
specifically
attempting
to
sow
political
discord
in
hong
kong
including
undermining
the
legitimacy
and
political
positions
of
the
protest
movement
on
the
ground
twitter
said
it
deleted
accounts
that
were
the
most
active
part
of
the
operation
while
a
large
network
of
other
spammy
accounts
were
also
proactively
suspended
the
company
went
a
step
further
deciding
to
ban
advertising
from
state-controlled
news
media
after
chinese
media
placed
ads
on
the
platform
suggesting
that
hong
kong
protesters
were
becoming
violent
facebook
announced
a
similar
crackdown
stating
monday
that
it
had
removed
seven
pages
three
groups
and
five
accounts
which
had
been
coordinating
inauthentic
behavior
in
hong
kong
from
mainland
china
they
frequently
posted
about
local
political
news
and
issues
including
topics
like
the
ongoing
protests
in
hong
kong
nathaniel
gleicher
facebook's
head
of
cybersecurity
said
in
a
statement
although
the
people
behind
this
activity
attempted
to
conceal
their
identities
our
investigation
found
links
to
individuals
associated
with
the
chinese
government
the
chinese
government
has
struggled
to
control
the
narrative
of
the
pro-democracy
protests
in
hong
kong
which
have
been
ongoing
for
more
than
weeks
what
initially
began
as
a
protest
over
an
extradition
bill
which
would
allow
china
greater
legal
jurisdiction
has
blossomed
into
an
all-encompassing
demonstration
against
the
territory's
government
police
brutality
and
in
support
of
democratic
reforms
on
sunday
an
estimated
million
people
nearly
of
the
city
defied
police
bans
to
turn
out
and
march
again
throughout
the
movement
protesters
have
remained
relatively
peaceful
although
there
were
some
noted
scuffles
last
tuesday
during
demonstrations
at
hong
kong's
airport
protesters
surrounded
and
attacked
two
men
from
mainland
china
including
a
state
media
journalist
the
protesters
accused
one
man
of
being
a
mainland
chinese
police
officer
impersonating
a
protester
according
to
the
new
york
times
video
footage
also
showed
protesters
beating
a
police
officer
with
his
baton
only
retreating
when
he
pulled
his
gun
protesters
later
apologized
for
the
incidents
at
the
airport
despite
violent
scuffles
being
mostly
an
aberration
during
the
protests
the
suspended
facebook
and
twitter
accounts
sought
to
portray
hong
kong
violence
as
the
norm
one
since-removed
facebook
account
compared
the
protesters
to
isis
while
another
referred
to
them
as
cockroaches
state-backed
chinese
media
meanwhile
has
tried
to
paint
protesters
as
a
vocal
minority
backed
by
foreign
powers
this
is
hardly
the
first
time
that
states
have
used
disinformation
tactics
to
further
their
own
political
goals
russia
of
course
famously
used
inauthentic
accounts
on
facebook
and
twitter
to
spread
disinformation
ahead
of
the
u.s.
presidential
election
cambridge
analytica
meanwhile
regularly
used
disinformation
in
elections
in
developing
countries
like
kenya
and
nigeria
despite
the
affect
it
had
on
those
countries
fraught
socio-economic
and
ethnic
tensions
