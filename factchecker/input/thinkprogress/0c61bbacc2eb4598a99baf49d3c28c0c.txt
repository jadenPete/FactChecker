steve
king
r-ia
doubled
down
friday
on
his
opposition
to
any
abortion
ban
that
would
allow
exceptions
for
rape
or
incest
last
week
king
opined
that
rape
and
incest
were
in
fact
required
for
the
survival
of
society
on
friday
anti-abortion
activists
including
the
head
of
iowa's
leading
anti-choice
group
stood
by
his
side
to
defend
him
what
if
we
went
back
through
all
the
family
trees
and
just
pulled
out
anyone
who
was
a
product
of
rape
or
incest
would
there
be
any
population
of
the
world
left
if
we
did
that
king
asked
the
westside
conservative
club
last
wednesday
as
part
of
his
defense
of
an
outright
abortion
ban
without
exceptions
the
head
of
king's
caucus
house
republican
conference
chair
liz
cheney
r-wy
called
his
statement
appalling
and
bizarre
adding
as
i've
said
before
it's
time
for
him
to
go
but
on
friday
at
a
des
moines
press
conference
king
misleadingly
claimed
that
he
had
initially
been
misquoted
and
that
the
reporting
had
been
corrected
the
des
moines
register
it's
true
did
correct
a
minor
part
of
its
initial
story
about
king's
original
comments
but
not
from
the
controversial
portion
of
his
speech
the
iowa
lawmaker
reiterated
his
view
that
no
matter
how
they
came
to
be
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
of
the
conception
every
life
is
sacred
king
was
joined
at
the
press
conference
by
several
leading
abortion-rights
opponents
who
defended
and
praised
him
for
his
stalwart
efforts
to
ban
all
abortions
rebecca
kiessling
founder
and
president
of
save
the
a
global
pro-life
organization
of
abortion
opponents
who
were
either
conceived
or
impregnated
by
rape
lionized
king
and
his
comments
just
like
i
get
accused
of
somehow
promoting
rape
because
i
have
the
audacity
to
value
my
life
this
is
the
same
thing
that
is
being
assigned
to
the
congressman
she
argued
that
somehow
because
he
values
the
lives
of
children
conceived
in
rape
king's
critics
are
saying
somehow
now
he's
defending
rape
because
he
acknowledges
that
there
was
rape
in
history
kiessling
also
read
statements
from
iowa
members
of
her
group
i
know
that
what
congressman
king
was
doing
in
his
statement
was
empathizing
with
people
like
her
she
said
tammy
kobza
of
the
phyllis
schlafly
eagles
in
iowa
praised
king
suggesting
that
iowans
from
other
congressional
districts
wished
they
could
vote
for
him
too
after
his
brave
stance
tamara
scott
iowa's
republican
national
committeewoman
and
host
of
a
conservative
television
program
also
spoke
in
king's
defense
while
tim
overland
executive
director
of
personhood
iowa
lauded
king
as
one
of
the
guys
who
has
gone
to
the
wall
and
who
has
had
our
backs
