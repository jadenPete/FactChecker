cyntoia
brown
like
other
women
of
color
was
punished
for
defending
herself
against
violence
brown
was
when
she
killed
a
man
who
she
said
made
her
fear
for
her
safety
cyntoia
brown
was
released
from
a
tennessee
prison
wednesday
after
spending
nearly
half
her
life
in
prison
for
killing
a
man
she
feared
was
on
the
verge
of
killing
her
first
the
case
has
been
highlighted
by
prison
reform
activists
and
civil
rights
groups
as
an
example
of
ways
the
criminal
justice
system
fails
girls
and
women
particularly
low-income
girls
and
women
of
color
who
have
suffered
abuse
the
year-old
brown
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
when
she
was
was
granted
clemency
in
january
by
the
governor
at
the
time
bill
haslam
r
in
johnny
allen
picked
up
the
then-teenager
and
took
her
back
to
his
home
for
sex
brown
has
said
that
she
went
home
with
allen
because
her
abusive
and
sexually
violent
boyfriend
and
pimp
garion
mcglothen
often
referred
to
as
kut
throat
told
her
she
had
to
earn
money
she
said
allen
showed
her
his
collection
of
guns
and
violently
grabbed
her
by
the
genitals
fearing
for
her
safety
she
took
a
gun
out
of
her
purse
and
shot
him
nashville
prosecutors
who
tried
brown
as
an
adult
made
the
argument
that
her
decision
to
shoot
allen
was
a
cold-blooded
murder
as
part
of
a
robbery
because
she
fled
his
home
in
his
car
with
his
money
and
guns
haslam
said
when
he
granted
clemency
however
that
a
life
sentence
one
that
would
have
required
her
to
serve
years
before
having
a
chance
for
parole
was
too
harsh
especially
in
light
of
the
extraordinary
steps
ms
brown
has
taken
to
rebuild
her
life
brown
will
be
on
parole
for
years
she
will
also
be
required
to
perform
at
least
hours
of
community
service
to
get
a
job
or
educational
enrollment
and
to
participate
in
regular
counseling
sessions
when
news
broke
of
the
governor
granting
her
clemency
in
january
the
aclu
tweeted
that
although
her
release
from
prison
is
good
news
years
probation
is
excessive
brown
said
in
a
statement
following
her
release
i
look
forward
to
using
my
experiences
to
help
other
women
and
girls
suffering
abuse
and
exploitation
her
case
received
renewed
media
attention
in
following
an
instagram
post
from
the
singer
rihanna
who
shared
her
story
and
wrote
freecyntoiabrown
that
same
year
kim
kardashian
also
tweeted
about
her
case
the
system
has
failed
and
said
she
would
call
her
attorneys
to
see
what
can
be
done
about
this
brown's
plight
also
drew
attention
to
the
way
in
which
tennessee
like
a
handful
of
other
states
considers
minors
who
commit
serious
crimes
as
beyond
the
rehabilitative
resources
of
tennessee
juvenile
courts
and
there
being
no
minimum
age
for
transfer
of
a
minor
for
serious
charges
according
to
the
website
the
appeal
several
states
have
no
minimum
age
for
transfers
even
though
many
young
people
such
as
brown
have
traumatic
upbringings
and
other
circumstances
to
consider
incarcerated

of
color
often
experience
abuse
and
violence
