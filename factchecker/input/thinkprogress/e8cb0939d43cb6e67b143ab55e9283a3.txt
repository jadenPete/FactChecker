britain's
pm
suspends
parliament
so
he
can
force
through
his
brexit
vision
the
government
can't
collapse
over
brexit
infighting
if
there's
no
government
at
work
britain's
prime
minister
boris
johnson
a
man
elected
with
the
support
of
just
percent
of
the
british
population
has
suspended
parliament
for
almost
a
month
ahead
of
the
october
st
brexit
deadline
sharply
reducing
the
amount
of
time
available
to
members
mps
hoping
to
block
a
no-deal
scenario
in
a
letter
to
conservative
mps
on
wednesday
johnson
said
he
has
asked
queen
elizabeth
ii
to
end
the
current
session
of
parliament
during
the
second
week
of
september
and
to
have
it
resume
five
weeks
later
on
october
th
on
that
date
the
queen
will
deliver
a
speech
laying
out
what
johnson
has
called
a
bold
and
ambitious
domestic
legislative
agenda
for
the
renewal
of
our
country
after
brexit
the
queen
approved
the
suspension
wednesday
afternoon
british
time
there
will
be
a
significant
brexit
legislative
programme
to
get
through
johnson
wrote
in
his
letter
but
that
should
be
no
excuse
for
a
lack
of
ambition
parliament
usually
holds
a
three-week
break
in
september
allowing
time
for
political
parties
to
hold
their
annual
conferences
but
there
was
widespread
expectation
that
the
break
would
be
scrapped
this
year
to
allow
more
time
to
debate
brexit
the
queen's
suspension
of
parliament
has
been
little
more
than
a
formality
for
decades
and
johnson
has
now
created
a
situation
in
which
her
position
is
inherently
politicized
johnson
appears
to
have
learned
a
lesson
from
the
tenure
of
his
predecessor
theresa
may
who
was
also
elected
by
the
conservative
party
and
not
the
british
public
and
who
at
various
times
was
torpedoed
by
parliament
in
her
efforts
to
deliver
brexit
he
has
maneuvered
to
avoid
that
fate
by
limiting
the
amount
of
debate
and
political
machinations
that
mps
can
undertake
hampering
their
ability
to
scuttle
a
no-deal
brexit
johnson
recently
has
backtracked
on
his
comments
that
the
chances
of
a
no-deal
brexit
were
a
million
to
one
and
now
says
the
odds
of
such
an
outcome
are
touch
and
go
he
has
vowed
to
deliver
brexit
one
way
or
another
by
october
st
the
prime
minister
was
a
key
player
during
the
leave
campaign
in
that
preceded
the
popular
vote
to
quit
the
european
union
his
de
facto
limiting
of
the
brexit
debate
is
likely
to
please
his
hardline
anti-eu
supporters
who
think
that
it
could
force
the
eu
to
make
concessions
to
prevent
the
damage
of
a
no-deal
brexit
there
is
absolutely
no
guarantee
however
that
the
eu
would
offer
those
concessions
the
two
sides
remain
at
loggerheads
especially
over
the
question
of
the
border
separating
the
republic
of
ireland
from
northern
ireland
the
eu
repeatedly
has
told
the
british
government
under
both
may
and
johnson
that
there
will
be
no
renegotiation
of
a
deal
the
two
parties
agreed
on
back
in
november
from
an
economic
perspective
a
no-deal
brexit
would
be
much
worse
for
the
uk
than
it
would
be
for
the
eu
continued
signs
of
the
massive
damage
that
a
no-deal
brexit
could
cause
are
hovering
around
the
edge
of
the
debate
as
johnson
announced
his
suspension
of
parliament
the
pound
started
crashing
against
the
dollar
and
earlier
this
month
a
bomb
targeting
police
officers
was
discovered
near
northern
ireland's
border
with
the
republic
of
ireland
a
sign
that
militant
violence
could
resurge
in
the
region
if
a
hard
border
returns
opposition
mps
and
former
cabinet
officials
were
outraged
by
johnson's
move
to
suspend
parliament
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
described
the
maneuver
as
a
smash
and
grab
on
our
democracy
to
force
through
a
no-deal
former
chancellor
philip
hammond
called
johnson's
decision
was
a
constitutional
outrage
and
profoundly
undemocratic
a
statement
echoed
by
house
of
commons
speaker
john
bercow
however
it
is
dressed
up
it
is
blindingly
obvious
that
the
purpose
of
prorogation
now
would
be
to
stop
parliament
debating
brexit
and
performing
its
duty
in
shaping
a
course
for
the
country
bercow
said
at
this
time
one
of
the
most
challenging
periods
in
our
nation's
history
it
is
vital
that
our
elected
parliament
has
its
say
there
might
be
an
even
more
nefarious
aim
to
johnson's
cancellation
however
forcing
a
general
election
if
mps
are
outraged
enough
by
johnson's
move
they
might
call
a
vote
of
no
confidence
setting
the
stage
for
a
general
election
right
before
the
brexit
vote
then
johnson
can
essentially
re-litigate
the
brexit
referendum
and
paint
himself
as
the
only
leader
who
can
deliver
brexit
on
the
final
day
of
october
this
in
turn
would
allow
johnson
another
four
years
before
he'd
need
to
call
a
general
election
again
and
potentially
make
for
years
of
uninterrupted
conservative
rule
of
course
with
brexit
no
one
ever
really
knows
what's
going
to
happen
next
johnson
could
call
a
general
election
tomorrow
or
he
could
be
ousted
by
his
cabinet
and
party
in
a
vote
of
no-confidence
or
he
could
lose
his
nerve
at
the
last
minute
in
october
and
return
to
the
earlier
deal
the
only
certainty
at
this
point
is
some
form
of
chaos
