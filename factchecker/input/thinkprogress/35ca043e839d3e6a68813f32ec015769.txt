who
do
the
log
cabin
republicans
think
they're
fooling
watching
the
gop
convention
before
donald
trump
took
the
stage
was
like
a
dream
fulfilled
the
log
cabin
republicans
write
once
upon
a
time
the
log
cabin
republicans
were
nominally
a
pro-lgbtq
organization
there
are
still
too
many
republican
candidates
who
try
to
capitalize
on
gay
issues
by
using
anti-gay
politics
decried
the
group's
former
executive
director
patrick
sammon
back
in
i
think
it's
less
effective
we'll
see
less
of
it
in
the
future
on
friday
the
same
group
offered
its
unqualified
endorsement
of
president
donald
trump
a
racist
sexist
white
supremacist
who
has
spent
his
first
three
years
in
office
undermining
every
protection
and
right
that
the
lgbtq
community
has
spent
decades
fighting
for
in
an
op-ed
published
in
the
washington
post
robert
kabel
and
jill
homan
the
group's
chairman
and
vice
chairwoman
bend
over
backwards
trying
to
find
a
positive
spin
on
the
blatantly
anti-lgbtq
agenda
put
forth
by
this
administration
a
mental
contortion
so
difficult
they
were
compelled
to
name
drop
apple
ceo
tim
cook
before
they
managed
to
invoke
the
man
they
are
endorsing
the
crux
of
their
argument
appears
to
be
that
the
republican
party's
animosity
towards
the
lgbtq
community
is
more
subtle
today
than
it
was
in
the
s
and
therefore
trump
is
deserving
of
praise
for
lgbtq
republicans
watching
the
gop
convention
before
donald
trump
took
the
stage
was
like
a
dream
fulfilled
kabel
and
homan
write
the
distance
between
that
event
and
pat
buchanan's
hate-filled
exhortation
against
the
lgbtq
community
in
houston
in
is
a
powerful
measurement
of
how
far
we've
come
that
is
the
tragicomical
bar
with
which
the
log
cabins
are
measuring
trump's
ally-ship
pat
buchanan
publicly
decrying
the
radical
feminism
of
president
bill
clinton's
agenda
of
homosexual
rights
onstage
at
the
republican
national
convention
and
it's
a
bar
that
as
kabel
and
homan
acknowledge
the
modern
gop
clears
only
barely
some
of
the
moral
leaders
who
stood
with
buchanan
back
then
were
still
there
three
years
ago
in
cleveland
to
be
sure
but
this
time
they
refrained
from
passing
judgment
on
gays
and
lesbians
the
endorsement
reads
yes
the
only
difference
between
pat
buchanan's
republican
party
and
donald
trump's
is
that
the
homophobia
is
now
latent
progress
kabel
and
homan
make
a
few
ham-fisted
attempts
to
point
to
accomplishments
by
the
current
administration
and
predictably
come
up
short
they
point
to
trump's
state
of
the
union
address
earlier
this
year
in
which
he
promised
to
end
the
spread
of
hiv
in
years
without
offering
much
in
the
way
of
details
about
how
he
planned
to
achieve
this
in
fact
in
the
months
since
that
promise
the
trump
administration
has
done
nothing
but
obstruct
access
to
health
care
particularly
among
those
who
are
most
vulnerable
to
hiv
diagnoses
trump
tried
to
take
credit
for
a
sizable
donation
of
hiv
prevention
drug
truvada
by
pharmaceutical
giant
gilead
neglecting
to
mention
the
donation
was
widely
seen
by
activists
as
little
more
than
a
public
relations
ploy
by
the
company
in
an
attempt
to
head
off
a
potential
legal
fight
over
the
drug's
expiring
patent
indeed
trump's
supposed
interest
in
ending
the
hiv
epidemic
flies
in
the
face
of
his
actual
record
on
the
issue
including
his
decision
to
fire
the
entire
membership
of
the
white
house's
presidential
advisory
council
on
hiv
aids
in
the
two
also
hailed
the
trump
administration's
recently
unveiled
initiative
to
fight
the
criminalization
of
homosexuality
abroad
specifically
targeting
a
list
of
some
countries
which
have
laws
expressly
prohibiting
homosexuality
they
point
to
the
selection
of
richard
grennell
the
highest
ranking
openly
gay
member
of
the
administration
who
was
appointed
to
head
up
the
initiative
to
underscore
the
seriousness
with
which
the
administration
is
addressing
the
problem
what
a
happy
coincidence
then
that
chief
on
the
list
of
countries
targeted
by
this
initiative
is
iran
a
country
that
trump
has
spent
his
entire
term
attacking
the
initiative
was
announced
weeks
after
iran
publicly
hanged
a
man
for
being
gay
and
was
seen
by
many
foreign
policy
experts
as
a
way
to
gin
up
international
pressure
on
the
country
under
the
guise
of
concern
for
human
rights
abuses
for
a
real
exploration
of
the
seriousness
with
which
the
administration
concerns
itself
with
anti-lgbtq
violence
abroad
consider
the
case
of
brunei
a
country
with
which
trump
has
had
numerous
previous
business
dealings
rulers
there
imposed
new
draconian
anti-lgbtq
laws
earlier
this
year
after
the
white
house's
initiative
was
launched
that
included
the
death
penalty
for
anyone
engaging
in
homosexual
acts
the
international
community
erupted
in
outrage
the
trump
white
house
was
silent
on
the
matter
also
on
the
list
of
anti-lgbtq
countries
saudi
arabia
in
april
five
men
were
accused
of
homosexuality
and
subsequently
beheaded
as
part
of
a
larger
mass
execution
of
nearly
people
for
various
charges
one
of
them
reportedly
had
his
dismembered
body
and
head
pinned
to
a
pole
in
a
public
square
trump
counts
the
saudi
royal
family
among
his
closest
business
partners
and
allies
and
has
repeatedly
sided
with
them
over
the
united
states
intelligence
agencies
his
financial
ties
to
the
country
and
its
monarchy
stretch
back
decades
and
into
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
just
how
invested
is
trump
in
his
administration's
effort
to
combat
international
oppression
of
the
lgbtq
community
a
white
house
reporter
wondered
the
same
kabel
and
homan's
last
piece
of
evidence
is
somehow
their
most
disingenuous
they
spend
a
paragraph
extolling
the
accomplishments
of
this
administration
arguing
that
they
benefitted
the
entire
country
and
since
there
are
lgbtq
people
in
the
country
ipso
facto
presto
chango
he
must
be
pro-lgbtq
among
the
accomplishments
they
cite
the
president's
tax
cuts
which
exploded
the
deficit
and
only
benefitted
the
wealthiest
americans
at
the
expense
of
low
and
middle
class
workers
aggressive
negotiations
on
trade
deals
which
have
resulted
in
an
economically
disastrous
trade
war
with
china
that
had
farmers
in
states
like
minnesota
booing
secretary
of
agriculture
sonny
perdue
this
week
and
his
hard
line
on
foreign
policy
including
among
other
things
his
inhumane
policy
of
forcibly
separating
children
from
their
parents
at
the
southwest
border
and
demonizing
asylum
seekers
who
are
fleeing
among
other
things
anti-lgbtq
persecution
in
their
home
countries
ignored
are
trump's
targeted
harassment
of
the
transgender
community
or
his
refusal
to
accommodate
the
same-sex
partners
of
foreign
diplomats
stationed
in
the
united
states
or
a
decision
announced
just
this
week
by
the
department
of
labor
to
make
it
easier
for
private
businesses
to
fire
employees
for
being
gay
to
any
discerning
human
whatever
support
the
current
occupant
of
the
white
house
displays
for
the
lgbtq
community
is
not
owed
to
a
concerted
effort
to
protect
a
vulnerable
persecuted
community
but
to
a
happy
accident
that
affords
the
administration
good
optics
or
to
have
the
log
cabin
republicans
of
put
it
another
way
the
fact
is
that
there
are
still
people
who
lack
integrity
who
are
willing
to
try
and
use
gay
people
as
a
political
issue
