the
impact
of
jay
inslee's
climate-focused
candidacy
jay
inslee
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
contest
the
fight
for
climate
action
is
ramping
up
washington
gov
jay
inslee
is
no
longer
vying
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
bringing
an
end
to
a
candidacy
devoted
almost
entirely
to
climate
action
but
his
departure
comes
as
concern
about
climate
change
is
galvanizing
voters
pushing
the
democratic
national
committee
dnc
to
consider
sanctioning
a
debate
devoted
exclusively
to
the
issue
meanwhile
some
of
inslee's
former
rivals
are
unveiling
their
own
ambitious
plans
to
address
global
warming
including
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
who
released
his
long-awaited
proposal
the
morning
after
inslee
dropped
out
trailing
in
polls
and
shut
out
of
the
third
round
of
democratic
debates
scheduled
for
september
inslee
announced
wednesday
night
that
he
was
exiting
the
race
he
said
he
will
seek
a
third
term
as
governor
instead
it's
become
clear
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
carrying
the
ball
i'm
not
going
to
be
the
president
so
i'm
withdrawing
tonight
from
the
race
inslee
told
msnbc's
rachel
maddow
the
governor
made
the
announcement
the
same
day
he
released
a
sweeping
plan
to
help
revitalize
rural
communities
and
use
agriculture
as
a
tool
to
address
climate
change
inslee
released
six
major
proposals
overall
using
global
warming
as
a
lens
through
which
to
discuss
immigration
the
economy
job
creation
and
systemic
inequality
immediately
following
his
exit
several
candidates
went
out
of
their
way
to
praise
inslee
lauding
his
singular
focus
on
climate
change
and
his
commitment
to
elevating
the
issue
thank
you
inslee
for
fighting
every
day
to
make
sure
that
climate
change
remains
a
primary
focus
of
this
election
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
wrote
on
twitter
climate
change
is
real
and
it's
a
crisis
and
i
will
keep
fighting
alongside
you
to
take
bold
action
before
it
is
too
late
with
inslee
gone
some
activists
have
expressed
concern
that
climate
issues
may
fall
by
the
wayside
but
others
argue
that
he
shifted
the
conversation
significantly
pushing
his
competitors
to
distinguish
themselves
on
climate
action
varshini
prakash
co-founder
of
the
youth-led
sunrise
movement
thanked
inslee
for
setting
the
pace
for
our
elected
leaders
on
the
climate
crisis
the
league
of
conservation
voters
lcv
said
that
inslee
set
an
incredibly
high
bar
for
discussing
climate
issues
we
have
no
doubt
that
governor
inslee
has
played
a
crucial
role
in
elevating
the
climate
crisis
to
the
top
of
the
agenda
within
this
primary
which
we
are
confident
will
remain
the
case
for
the
rest
of
the
primary
lcv
president
gene
karpinski
said
in
a
statement
climate
change
remains
central
for
democrats
even
without
inslee
one
of
his
major
demands
was
a
dnc
climate
debate
that
would
allow
candidates
to
draw
contrasts
with
one
another
on
the
issue
two
climate
forums
are
planned
for
september
but
neither
is
an
official
debate
the
dnc
has
so
far
resisted
calls
for
a
designated
climate
debate
arguing
that
no
issue
should
be
elevated
above
others
but
that
could
change
on
thursday
the
dnc
is
expected
to
consider
two
different
resolutions
one
calling
for
a
formal
debate
and
one
that
lends
support
to
the
two
scheduled
climate
forums
while
supporters
of
a
climate
debate
have
said
they
don't
expect
it
to
win
enough
support
given
largely
to
opposition
from
dnc
chair
tom
perez
washington
state
democratic
party
chair
tina
podlodowski
told
the
mercury
news
that
she
will
press
on
anyway
podlodowski
is
sponsoring
the
pro-debate
resolution
even
if
no
formal
climate
debate
occurs
candidates
are
likely
to
continue
pushing
the
conversation
polling
shows
that
voters
are
deeply
concerned
about
climate
change
and
want
lawmakers
to
address
the
problem
quickly
on
thursday
morning
sanders
became
the
latest
contender
to
roll
out
a
climate
plan
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
d-tx
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
billionaire
tom
steyer
are
among
the
candidates
to
have
released
similar
proposals
while
warren
has
pushed
a
slew
of
smaller-scale
plans
aimed
at
specific
targets
like
decarbonizing
the
military
and
reducing
emissions
linked
to
agriculture
sanders
plan
stands
out
from
those
of
his
rivals
with
a
hefty
price
tag
trillion
his
vision
for
a
green
new
deal
would
create
million
jobs
and
completely
zero
out
emissions
by
mid-century
the
green
new
deal
blueprint
aims
to
decarbonize
the
economy
swiftly
through
a
year
mobilization
something
sanders
also
accounts
for
both
electricity
and
transportation
would
be
completely
powered
by
renewable
energy
as
of
under
his
plan
with
inslee
out
of
the
race
sanders
now
touts
the
most
ambitious
climate
proposal
but
the
washington
governor
indicated
in
a
farewell
interview
with
nymag
that
he
hopes
his
own
plans
gain
traction
among
other
candidates
those
still
competing
to
be
president
we're
not
claiming
copyright
so
we're
hoping
other
candidates
use
it
as
a
template
going
forward
inslee
said
there
are
hundreds
of
policy
ideas
for
people
to
run
with
so
i
hope
they
do
