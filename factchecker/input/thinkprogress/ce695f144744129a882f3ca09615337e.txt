the
house's
top
republican
blames
video
games
for
mass
shootings
it's
the
same
tired
excuse
that's
been
used
since
columbine
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-ca
took
to
fox
news
on
sunday
in
the
wake
of
two
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
tx
and
dayton
oh
to
suggest
that
blame
could
lie
at
least
partially
with
video
games
the
idea
that
these
video
games
that
dehumanize
individuals
to
have
a
game
of
shooting
individuals
i've
always
felt
that
it's
a
problem
for
future
generations
and
others
mccarthy
said
we've
watched
studies
show
what
it
does
to
individuals
and
you
look
at
these
photos
of
how
it
took
place
you
can
see
the
actions
within
video
games
and
others
mccarthy's
comments
echo
ones
made
by
texas
lieutenant
governor
dan
patrick
on
fox
friends
sunday
morning
how
long
are
we
going
to
ignore
at
the
federal
level
particularly
where
they
can
do
something
about
the
video
game
industry
patrick
said
in
this
manifesto
that
we
believe
is
from
the
shooter
this
manifesto
where
he
talks
about
living
out
his
super
soldier
fantasy
on
call
of
duty
first
of
all
patrick
is
completely
wrong
the
manifesto
actually
encourages
would-be-terrorists
not
to
live
out
their
super
soldier
fantasy
by
attacking
well-protected
targets
and
instead
target
locations
where
security
is
minimal
like
shopping
malls
secondly
the
video
games
are
responsible
for
mass
shootings
talking
point
has
been
trotted
out
since
when
president
bill
clinton
ordered
an
investigation
into
violent
media
in
the
wake
of
the
columbine
massacre
it's
become
a
repeated
easy
talking
point
for
politicians
looking
to
find
a
convenient
scapegoat
for
mass
shootings
that
doesn't
involve
confronting
the
ease
of
firearm
availability
or
the
persistent
strength
of
far-right
extremism
in
wake
of
the
parkland
shooting
last
february
for
instance
the
trump
white
house
held
a
round
table
about
perceived
violence
in
video
games
this
is
all
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
little-to-no
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that
video
games
cause
mass
shootings
a
study
of
the
world's
ten
largest
video
game
markets
showed
absolutely
no
correlation
between
video
games
and
violence
if
the
correlation
was
as
mccarthy
trump
and
patrick
have
all
suggested
then
countries
like
south
korea
the
netherlands
and
the
u.k.
would
all
experience
regular
mass
shootings
or
rampage-style
attacks
which
they
don't
what's
more
when
videogames
do
appear
as
part
of
an
investigation
into
a
mass
shooting
the
connection
is
often
quite
nebulous
adam
lanza
for
instance
who
carried
out
the
sandy
hook
school
shooting
was
a
fan
of
the
game
dance
dance
revolution
anders
behring
breivik
who
carried
out
the
far-terror
attack
in
norway
in
was
a
fan
of
the
fantasy
multiplayer
game
world
of
warcraft
