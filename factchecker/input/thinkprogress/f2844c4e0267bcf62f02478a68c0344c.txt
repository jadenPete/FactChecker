among

i'm
asking

to
listen
to
her
message
i'm
asking
you
to
join
me
in
my
vision
for
the
working
family's
champion
said
haaland
the

outlined
in

ending
domestic
violence
on

provide

boxes
she
said
laws
in
republican-controlled
states
aimed
at
stopping
people
of
color
including
native
americans
are
an
attack
on
democracy
voter
suppression
is
democracy
suppression
and
it
must
stop
the
idea
that
one
of
the
major
political
parties
in
this
country
intends
to
retain
power
by
keeping
american
citizens
from
voting
is
appalling
and
we
need
to
be
willing
to
fight
back
against
that
in
all
places
where
it
shows
up
warren
said
warren's
plan
on
native
american
issues

a
supreme
court
decision

the
social
and
economic

said
that
warren
has
been
doing
a
lot
behind

in
indian
country
and
described
warren's
past
ancestry
claims
as
a
non-issue
among
her
and
many
other
tribal
leaders
she's
spoken
with
all
of
us
have
our
own
history
and
we
were
brought
up
and
your
outlook
and
your
views
are
shaped
by
what
you're
told
is
your
ancestry
told
who
you
are
andrews-maltais
said
just
because
somebody
is
not
an
enrolled
citizen
does
not
mean
that
they
do
not
have
heritage
or
if
that's
the
community
you
grew
up
with
or
grew
up
in
and
those
were
the
values
that
were
instilled
upon
you
than
that's
who
you
are
everybody
has
their
truth
russell
attebery
a
tribal
chairperson
of
the
karuk
tribe
in
northern
california
said
he
wished
warren
and
other
presidential
candidates
would
put
more
focus
on
solving
ecological
issues
facing
his
nation
especially
after
their
land's
natural
resources
were
decimated
by
large-scale
forest
fires
but
he
said
warren
has
good
intentions
and
praised
her
proposals
that
provide
new
funds
to
solve
a
number
of
issues
facing
native
country
we
do
support
her
because
obviously
she's
an
advocate
for
indian
country
and
wants
to
see
the
wrongs
righted
attebery
said
earlier
monday
marianne
williamson
received
a
standing
ovation
from
tribal
leaders
after
she
addressed
a
number
of
issues
such
as
giving
native
americans
a
video
platform
that
will
allow
them
to
tell
americans
about
their
stories
and
vowing
to
stop
pipeline
projects
williamson
said

would
solve
issues
such
as
homelessness
among
native
americans
and
the
high
rates
of
murdered
indigenous
women
through
spiritual
healing
she
called
on
connecting
federal
agencies
with
native
tribal
police
on
solving
murder
cases
that
occur
on
reservations
williamson
added
that
in
order
to
solve
high
suicide
rates
on
native
territories
they
needed
to
address
the
fact
that
the
native
connection
to
their
land
was
destroyed
by
the
white
european
culture
she
proposed
creating
a
pair
of
federal
agencies
a
department
of
peace
that
will
look
at
violence
in
america
and
incorporate
native
traditions
into
the
federal
government
and
department
of
children
and
youth
that
addresses
trauma
and
food
insecurity
among
american
children
she
wanted
to
create
a
more
equitable
education
system
and
include
a
native
american
curriculum
in
all
schools
williamson
also
gave
an
impassioned
speech
about
how
important
it
is
to
stop
voter
suppression
by
expanding
and
restoring
the
voting
rights
