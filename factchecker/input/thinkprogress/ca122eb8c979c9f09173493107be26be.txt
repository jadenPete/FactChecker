missing
and
murdered
women
is
a
grim
unsolved
problem
native
communities
are
demanding
action
four
in
five
native
women
experience
violence
at
some
time
in
their
lives
sioux
city
iowa
faith
spotted
eagle
recalls
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
time
she
and
three
friends
were
viciously
beaten
by
five
white
men
it
was
months
after
an
armed
occupation
by
members
of
the
oglala
nation
in
the
town
of
wounded
knee
in
south
dakota
that
standoff
between
indigenous
protesters
and
federal
law
enforcement
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
two
native
americans
it
also
riled
up
white
sentiment
against
indigenous
people
the
protest
which
lasted
days
aimed
to
call
attention
to
onerous
federal
policies
toward
native
americans
to
point
the
finger
at
a
local
white
south
dakota
leader
accused
of
abusing
his
power
at
the
time
of
the
attack
on
her
and
her
friends
years
ago
spotted
eagle
was
a
young
woman
studying
at
the
university
of
south
dakota
and
walking
along
the
streets
of
vermillion
south
dakota
but
the
native
women's
very
presence
was
all
the
provocation
needed
for
their
aggressors
who
bellowed
racist
slurs
taunting
them
as
squaws
and
prairie
niggers
as
they
drove
by
in
their
car
then
the
men
got
out
of
the
vehicle
and
again
unprovoked
started
beating
them
one
picked
up
spotted
eagle
and
threw
her
against
a
parked
car
after
she
slid
off
the
hood
he
started
to
kick
her
shattering
one
of
her
legs
bystanders
did
nothing
to
help
the
attack
was
unthinkable
in
its
brutality
and
yet
reflects
everyday
reality
for
native
women
who
are
victims
of
physical
violence
with
shocking
regularity
indigenous
women
for
generations
have
confronted
an
epidemic
of
murder
kidnappings
and
rape
they
disappear
into
the
sex-slavery
trade
or
simply
disappear
altogether
and
as
faith
spotted
eagle
discovered
years
ago
they
can
sometimes
become
the
victims
of
a
brutal
racist
beatdown
we
were
told
to
be
careful
and
that
was
an
instance
where
we
thought
we
were
more
safe
on
the
city
street
and
we
weren't
spotted
eagle
who
at
is
white-haired
and
wizened
told
thinkprogress
when
my
leg
was
broken
i
was
targeted
on
the
street
they
didn't
beat
up
any
white
people
they
beat
us
up
with
a
population
of
under
million
the
american
indian
population
is
relatively
small
but
in
alone
there
were
reports
of
missing
or
murdered
native
women
and
girls
across
the
country
according
to
research
by
the
urban
indian
health
institute
another
grim
study
from
the
national
institute
of
justice
found
in
that
four
in
five
or
million
american
indian
or
alaska
native
women
experience
violence
in
their
lifetimes
over
half
of
native
women
have
been
victims
of
sexual
violence
while
that
violence
in
many
cases
is
committed
by
an
intimate
partner
native
americans
are
more
likely
than
people
of
other
races
to
experience
violence
committed
by
someone
of
a
different
race
a
justice
department
report
found
about
nine
in
native
american
rape
or
sexual-assault
victims
had
assailants
who
were
white
or
black
the
report
said
although
the
number
of
native
americans
murdered
or
missing
in
exceeded
roughly
the
number
of
people
who
died
during
the
september
terror
attack
the
justice
department's
missing
persons
database
logged
only
cases
that
year
the
sheer
scale
of
the
violence
against
native
women
and
the
abysmal
failure
by
the
government
to
adequately
address
it
explains
why
the
issue
was
given
such
prominence
during
this
week's
presidential
candidates
forum
in
sioux
city
the
first
to
focus
entirely
on
native
american
issues
many
of
the
indigenous
women
in
attendance
said
that
even
more
important
than
candidates
offering
solutions
was
that
they
were
there
at
all
helping
thrust
native
issues
into
the
national
spotlight
the
community
has
in
fact
come
to
be
more
than
a
little
skeptical
of
politicians
promises
in
the
past
task
forces
have
studied
violence
against
native
women
but
members
of
the
indigenous
community
say
it's
not
been
nearly
enough
legislation
has
simply
scratched
the
surface
assurances
from
elected
leaders
that
the
issue
will
be
addressed
have
seldom
been
kept
every
time
a
new
president
comes
in
they
come
up
with
a
so-called
answer
to
the
indian
problem
said
spotted
eagle
who
is
the
founder
of
a
native
advocacy
group
the
brave
heart
society
it's
not
as
if
the
abuse
of
native
women
is
a
new
issue
white
colonizers
have
been
raping
and
brutalizing
native
women
since
europeans
arrived
in
the
americas
hundreds
of
years
ago
spotted
eagle
said
members
of
her
yankton
sioux
tribe
living
in
south
dakota
have
been
abused
by
white
colonizers
since
the
u.s.
military
outpost
fort
randall
was
created
in
native
women
make
easy
targets
indian
reservations
are
located
for
the
most
part
in
remote
desolate
regions
of
the
country
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
for
most
americans
current
laws
give
understaffed
and
under-resourced
tribal
police
little
power
to
investigate
and
prosecute
non-tribal
members
who
commit
such
crimes
said
tom
rodgers
acting
president
of
the
global
indigenous
council
if
i'm
a
successful
perpetrator
i'm
going
to
go
to
places
where
i
know
the
chances
of
being
caught
are
slim
rodgers
said
they
work
hard
they
drink
hard
they
see
a
population
of
people
and
women
that
are
vulnerable
that
are
isolated
you
see
that
interaction
federal
and
state
law-enforcement
agencies
also
struggle
to
solve
such
crimes
because
they
have
little
presence
or
sometimes
none
at
all
in
remote
reservations
some
carry
a
bias
against
native
people
tribal
leaders
say
the
situation
has
worsened
in
some
areas
including
in
north
dakota
as
a
result
of
an
oil
boom
of
recent
years
crews
working
on
pipeline
projects
live
in
temporary
facilities
known
as
man
camps
that
are
located
near
a
number
of
native
reservations
in
the
region
news
reports
say
men
affiliated
with
the
camps
are
sometimes
suspected
of
preying
on
native
women
in
recent
years
reports
have
surged
of
violent
crimes
committed
against
women
and
girls
from
three
affiliated
tribes
of
mandan
hidatsa
and
arikara
in
the
region
media
coverage
and
the
lack
of
it
has
also
been
part
of
the
problem
when
an
affluent
white
woman
goes
missing
there
are
often
nationwide
manhunts
alerts
and
round-the-clock
news
coverage
but
when
a
native
woman
goes
missing
news
coverage
can
be
minimal
to
nonexistent
news
organizations
have
historically
given
a
disproportionate
amount
of
coverage
to
white
victims
for
a
number
of
reasons
lack
of
newsroom
diversity
storylines
they
believe
will
generate
ratings
and
a
certain
level
of
pure
discrimination
joshua
benton
director
of
harvard
university's
nieman
journalism
lab
told
thinkprogress
for
indigenous
women
there's
also
the
factor
of
geography
news
outlets
are
nearly
all
located
in
urban
areas
most
of
them
very
far
away
from
reservations
said
benton
the
community
is
taking
matters
into
its
own
hands
as
it
tries
to
draw
attention
to
the
problem
of
violence
against
native
women
the
native
rights
organization
global
indigenous
council
along
with
other
regional
tribal
leadership
groups
recently
placed
billboards
along
highways
in
states
where
native
women
often
go
missing
including
in
minnesota
north
dakota
south
dakota
michigan
montana
new
mexico
arizona
and
oklahoma
the
billboards
which
say
invisible
no
more
show
the
face
of
a
native
woman
with
a
giant
red
hand
painted
over
her
mouth
many
of
the
candidates
attending
this
week's
forum
pledged
to
support
a
number
of
bills
that
have
been
introduced
in
congress
to
address
aspects
of
the
issue
in
recent
years
the
plans
of
two
candidates
in
particular
seemed
to
garner
support
at
the
forum
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
and
former
housing
secretary
juli
n
castro
both
proposed
additional
funding
to
support
victims
of
assault
and
abuse
warren
also
pledged
to
fully
fund
under-resourced
public
safety
and
criminal
justice
efforts
in
native
communities
there
also
have
been
some
efforts
on
capitol
hill
to
address
the
problem
among
the
legislation
that
appears
to
have
the
best
prospects
of
getting
passed
is
a
bill
with
bipartisan
support
in
the
house
and
the
senate
that
would
improve
federal
data
collection
on
violent
crimes
committed
against
indigenous
people
and
provide
new
training
guidelines
for
how
federal
agencies
respond
to
such
cases
another
bill
the
not
invisible
act
would
create
an
advisory
committee
that
would
make
recommendations
on
how
the
justice
and
interior
departments
can
best
use
their
resources
to
address
violence
against
indigenous
women
and
the
reauthorizing
the
violence
against
women
act
which
already
has
passed
in
the
house
would
allow
tribal
law-enforcement
agencies
to
investigate
and
prosecute
non-indians
who
commit
crimes
of
sexual
violence
sex
trafficking
stalking
child
abuse
and
violence
against
tribal
members
on
their
land
however
it
is
unclear
whether
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
will
allow
any
of
those
measures
to
come
to
the
floor
and
some
tribal
members
say
the
bills
only
scratch
the
surface
when
it
comes
to
solving
the
problem
of
violence
against
women
what
would
help
rodgers
said
is
if
state
federal
local
and
tribal
law-enforcement
agencies
stop
working
in
silos
and
communicate
with
each
other
better
there's
also
a
need
for
better
training
to
improve
cooperation
among
agencies
federal
agents
should
be
required
to
take
anti-bias
training
before
being
assigned
cases
on
reservations
he
said
the
global
indigenous
council
with
the
backing
of
indian
tribes
proposed
various
amendments
to
a
congressional
bill
that
would
create
an
interagency
law-enforcement
body
within
each
u.s.
bureau
of
indian
affairs
region
to
help
coordinate
efforts
among
federal
state
and
tribal
agencies
the
council
has
a
raft
of
other
proposals
including
creating
tribal
liaison
offices
to
help
indigenous
victims
to
get
support
and
share
information
about
cases
another
would
allow
police
to
monitor
and
clamp
down
on
man
camps
but
in
the
end
no
legislation
will
work
if
it
doesn't
include
additional
federal
funding
that
would
give
tribal
and
federal
law-enforcement
officers
the
resources
they
need
to
investigate
and
prosecute
cases
rodgers
said
we
have
an
extremely
vulnerable
population
with
little
to
no
resources
across
the
board
he
said
we
don't
need
legislation
that
is
not
being
funded
you
can
take
your
platitudes
and
your
nice
commissions
and
everything
we
know
what
the
problem
is
enough
funding
