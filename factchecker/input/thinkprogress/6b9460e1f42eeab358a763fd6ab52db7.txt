after
losing
one
of
its
top
female
athletes
nike
decides
it
cares
about
maternity
rights
it
should
not
have
taken
this
long
three
months
after
multiple
female
track
stars
talked
to
the
new
york
times
about
the
ways
their
nike
contract
punished
them
for
becoming
pregnant
the
sportswear
giant
has
amended
its
policy
to
guarantee
that
a
pregnant
athlete's
pay
and
bonuses
cannot
be
cut
for
an
month
period
surrounding
their
pregnancy
eight
months
before
the
due
date
through
months
after
the
news
comes
less
than
a
month
after
one
of
its
most
high-profile
athletes
olympic
champion
runner
allyson
felix
signed
with
another
apparel
brand
after
a
public
dispute
with
nike
over
its
treatment
of
pregnant
athletes
while
this
is
good
news
it's
long
overdue
and
frankly
it's
embarrassing
that
a
company
that
likes
to
run
advertisements
promoting
women's
empowerment
and
applauding
mothers
in
sport
had
to
be
publicly
shamed
into
providing
maternity
rights
to
its
athletes
before
nike
had
zero
consistent
protections
for
pregnant
athletes
in
its
contracts
last
year
nike
gave
pregnant
athletes
months
worth
of
protections
though
it
didn't
communicate
that
properly
to
all
of
its
athletes
female
athletes
and
their
representatives
will
begin
receiving
written
confirmation
reaffirming
nike's
official
pregnancy
policy
for
elite
athletes
a
nike
spokesperson
wrote
in
an
email
to
the
washington
post
in
addition
to
our
policy
standardizing
our
approach
across
all
sports
to
ensure
no
female
athlete
is
adversely
impacted
financially
for
pregnancy
the
policy
has
now
been
expanded
to
cover
months
thankfully
this
new
policy
will
apply
to
current
contracts
as
well
as
future
ones
none
of
this
would
be
possible
without
olympic
runners
alysia
monta
o
kara
goucher
and
allyson
felix
breaking
their
silence
and
even
more
crucially
their
nondisclosure
agreements
this
may
in
a
conversation
with
the
new
york
times
in
an
op-ed
titled
nike
told
me
to
dream
crazy
until
i
had
a
baby
monta
o
accused
nike
of
advertising
its
support
of
women
and
mothers
without
actually
supporting
them
in
real
life
monta
o
gained
fame
as
the
pregnant
runner
when
she
ran
the
u.
s
championships
while
eight
months
pregnant
so
many
women
saw
this
as
empowering
but
in
reality
she
was
doing
so
out
of
necessity
not
out
of
a
desire
to
make
a
statement
nike
contracts
at
the
time
required
women
to
compete
in
a
certain
number
of
races
do
appearances
for
the
company
and
maintain
their
top
form
in
order
to
continue
to
earn
the
money
available
to
them
in
their
contracts
those
requirements
did
not
change
when
an
athlete
became
pregnant
goucher
revealed
to
the
times
that
she
was
forced
to
leave
her
sick
newborn
in
the
hospital
alone
so
she
could
train
for
a
race
that
she
was
forced
to
run
in
order
to
get
a
paycheck
from
nike
a
week
after
goucher
and
monta
o
opened
up
felix
decided
to
come
forward
with
her
story
felix
is
one
of
the
most
successful
and
recognizable
female
runners
in
the
country
with
six
olympic
gold
medals
but
in
when
she
decided
to
get
pregnant
she
was
incredibly
nervous
about
what
how
it
would
impact
her
contract
with
nike
i
asked
nike
to
contractually
guarantee
that
i
wouldn't
be
punished
if
i
didn't
perform
at
my
best
in
the
months
surrounding
childbirth
i
wanted
to
set
a
new
standard
if
i
one
of
nike's
most
widely
marketed
athletes
couldn't
secure
these
protections
who
could
she
said
nike
declined
we've
been
at
a
standstill
ever
since
not
only
was
nike
not
willing
to
provide
her
those
guarantees
but
it
also
wanted
to
pay
her
percent
less
than
it
had
paid
her
before
her
pregnancy
her
contract
with
nike
expired
at
the
end
of
felix
and
nike
never
were
able
to
work
out
their
differences
on
july
felix
signed
a
multi-year
sponsorship
agreement
with
althea
which
included
full
protection
during
maternity
i'm
just
really
thrilled
about
it
felix
told
people
the
way
that
they
are
doing
sponsorship
to
me
is
incredible
it
is
focused
on
me
as
a
whole
as
an
athlete
as
a
mom
and
as
an
activist
and
just
to
be
supported
in
that
way
is
amazing
the
nyt
articles
from
may
have
already
had
a
huge
impact
across
the
sports
industry
burton
decided
to
change
its
contracts
for
female
athletes
effective
immediately
in
order
to
support
and
protect
women
during
and
after
pregnancy
among
the
changes
burton
ensured
that
pregnancy
would
not
be
considered
a
medical
condition
it
would
not
terminate
a
contract
for
pregnancy
or
maternity
reasons
other
brands
including
altra
nuun
and
brooks
made
similar
guarantees
maternity
rights
in
professional
sports
are
always
a
difficult
thing
for
athletes
to
navigate
and
in
team
sports
it's
labor
unions
which
have
had
to
fight
for
such
benefits
in
leagues
such
as
the
wnba
and
national
women's
soccer
league
nwsl
but
in
individual
sports
such
as
track
field
golf
and
tennis
the
female
athletes
are
even
more
vulnerable
because
they
don't
have
a
salary
but
instead
have
to
compete
and
win
in
order
to
earn
money
that's
why
it's
important
for
sponsors
like
nike
to
step
up
it
finally
is
thanks
to
the
bravery
of
its
athletes
who
risked
it
all
to
speak
up
and
fight
for
a
better
future
for
female
athletes
everywhere
