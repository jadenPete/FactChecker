trump
is
already
back
to
attacking
his
political
opponents
over
the
recent
mass
shootings
trump's
plea
for
bipartisanship
following
mass
shootings
didn't
even
last
two
days
president
donald
trump
said
in
formal
remarks
monday
that
in
the
wake
of
this
weekend's
deadly
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
now
is
the
time
to
set
destructive
partisanship
aside
that
window
of
bipartisanship
lasted
less
than
two
days
by
wednesday
morning
the
president
had
begun
lashing
out
at
his
democratic
opponents
including
trying
to
blame
them
for
some
of
the
recent
tragedies
trump
tweeted
a
quote
early
on
wednesday
from
conservative
news
site
one
america
news
suggesting
that
the
dayton
ohio
shooter
was
motivated
by
his
support
for
liberal
candidates
and
causes
including
democratic
presidential
candidates
sens
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
meanwhile
the
dayton
ohio
shooter
had
a
history
of
supporting
political
figures
like
bernie
sanders
elizabeth
warren
and
antifa
oann
i
hope
other
news
outlets
will
report
this
as
opposed
to
fake
news
thank
you
he
wrote
later
wednesday
morning
trump
referenced
the
shooter's
support
for
sanders
and
warren
three
more
times
but
insisted
he
wasn't
trying
to
blame
the
senators
for
the
shooting
he
claimed
that
his
critics
were
simply
trying
to
make
political
points
by
attacking
him
i
don't
think
it
worked
because
you
know
i
would
like
to
stay
out
of
the
political
fray
white
house
staffers
kellyanne
conway
and
hogan
gidley
had
both
been
on
fox
news
a
day
earlier
to
argue
similar
claims
that
trump
could
try
and
link
the
dayton
attacker
to
liberal
politicians
but
would
never
actually
do
that
and
say
that
trump
was
uniting
the
country
the
el
paso
shooter
left
behind
a
manifesto
specifically
using
trump's
racist
rhetoric
on
immigrant
invasions
to
explain
his
motivations
so
far
no
evidence
has
yet
connected
the
dayton
shooter's
political
beliefs
to
a
motive
the
reference
to
the
dayton
shooter's
politics
on
wednesday
was
one
of
several
partisan
attacks
trump
launched
this
week
he
also
condemned
radical
left
democrats
for
criticizing
a
new
york
times
headline
that
read
trump
urges
unity
vs
racism
and
lashed
out
at
former
texas
congressman
and
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
mocking
him
for
having
a
phony
name
to
indicate
hispanic
heritage
and
telling
him
to
be
quiet
o'rourke
was
not
inclined
to
oblige
people
in
my
hometown
are
dead
after
an
act
of
terror
inspired
by
your
racism
he
tweeted
el
paso
will
not
be
quiet
and
neither
will
i.
trump's
partisan
attacks
come
just
hours
ahead
of
planned
stops
in
both
dayton
and
el
paso
where
he
said
he
hopes
to
meet
with
first
responders
law
enforcement
and
some
of
the
victims
of
the
terrible
shootings
residents
of
both
cities
however
have
voiced
strong
objections
to
trump's
visits
for
reasons
that
extend
beyond
the
divisiveness
of
his
racist
rhetoric
during
his
remarks
monday
he
appeared
to
forget
which
ohio
city
he
was
discussing
offering
his
sympathies
instead
to
the
people
of
toledo
in
the
past
he
has
falsely
claimed
that
el
paso
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
cities
and
has
taken
credit
for
his
border
wall
making
it
safer
even
though
the
city's
violent
crime
rate
plummeted
long
before
trump
was
even
elected
there
are
other
reasons
the
president
might
not
receive
a
warm
welcome
in
el
paso
trump's
presidential
campaign
also
still
owes
the
city
including
late
fees
for
public
safety
services
provided
for
a
rally
he
held
there
back
in
february
o'rourke
had
held
a
rally
the
same
day
but
his
campaign
covered
his
expenses
in
full
