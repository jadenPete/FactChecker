alabama
governor's
blackface
scandal
shows
gop's
hypocrisy
they
demanded
democratic
gov
ralph
northam
of
virginia
resign
over
similar
issues
gov
kay
ivey
r-al
adamantly
vowed
on
tuesday
that
she
would
not
resign
her
office
despite
revelations
last
week
that
she
once
appeared
in
blackface
in
a
college
baptist
student
union
skit
while
she
was
a
student
at
auburn
university
the
national
republican
leaders
who
demanded
a
democratic
governor
resign
for
a
very
similar
scandal
have
suddenly
changed
their
minds
on
whether
this
is
a
forgivable
offense
ivey
at
her
first
public
appearance
since
releasing
a
video
message
apologizing
for
the
incident
said
heavens
no
i'm
not
going
to
resign
it's
something
that
happened
years
ago
and
i'm
not
that
person
my
administration
stands
on
being
inclusive
and
helping
people
ivey's
record
has
been
anything
but
inclusive
she
vocally
opposed
the
lgbtq
agenda
and
lifestyle
signed
a
bill
allowing
adoption
agencies
to
discriminate
on
religious
freedom
grounds
and
ran
a
campaign
ad
boasting
of
her
efforts
to
protect
confederate
memorials
president
donald
trump
whose
racist
record
and
rhetoric
has
been
a
hallmark
of
his
political
career
backed
ivey
on
friday
praising
her
as
a
very
very
high-quality
woman
who
had
already
apologized
but
earlier
this
year
trump
and
his
handpicked
gop
leadership
showed
no
such
forgiveness
when
a
democrat
was
in
an
almost
identical
position
in
february
gov
ralph
northam
d-va
was
thought
to
have
been
captured
in
a
photo
from
his
year-old
medical
school
yearbook
page
showing
a
man
in
blackface
and
another
man
dressed
in
ku
klux
klan
robes
northam
apologized
for
the
photo
though
he
later
claimed
he
did
not
believe
he
was
in
either
picture
he
did
admit
to
and
apologize
for
wearing
blackface
to
imitate
michael
jackson
once
trump
called
northam's
actions
unforgivable
at
the
time
rnc
chair
ronna
mcdaniel
who
has
thus
far
been
silent
on
the
ivey
controversy
tweeted
more
than
a
dozen
times
demanding
northam's
immediate
resignation
and
then-rnc
spokeswoman
kayleigh
mcenany
now
trump's
campaign
secretary
has
also
been
silent
on
ivey's
scandal
despite
demanding
that
northam
step
down
it's
time
for
the
democratic
governor
to
step
down
it's
time
for
him
to
resign
she
urged
during
a
february
msnbc
interview
there's
no
place
in
society
for
those
images
there's
no
place
in
society
for
those
beliefs
and
he's
got
to
stop
down
