president
donald
trump's
unilateral
decision
to
pursue
trade
wars
with
china
has
increased
america's
trade
deficit
and
harmed
american
farmers
who
rely
on
exports
to
earn
a
living

the
president
continued
to
lie
this
week
about
how
his
policies
have
hurt
those
farmers
his
cabinet
secretary
responsible
for
overseeing
farming
came
under
fire
for
calling
them
a
bunch
of
whiners
secretary
of
agriculture
sonny
perdue
who
previously
admitted
that
u.s.

a
basement
i
said
i

know
what
do
you
call
them
he
said
a
whine
cellar
that
attempt
at
humor
was
reportedly
met
with
some
laughter
but
also
booing
despite
the
dire
effects
of
his
ongoing
trade
war
trump
has
touted
his
repeated
tariff
threats
against
countries
like
china
as
beneficial
to
the
country
farmers
getting
more
than
china
would
be
spending
fake
news
won't
report
he
tweeted
on
tuesday
ignoring
all
of
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
trump
also
retweeted
a
tweet
from
his
official
campaign
account
on
monday
morning
suggesting
that
even
though
farmers
were
hurting
they
were
still
behind
trump
no
battle
is
over
in
a
minute
if
it
is
it
wasn't
worth
fighting
one
farmer
said
in
a
video
attached
to
the
tweet
we're
in
a
hole
right
now
but
i
think
if
they
go
as
they
are
will
get
evened
out
another
farmer
said
the
trump
administration
on
tuesday
narrowed
its
list
of
tariffs
on
some
chinese
imports
which
were
set
to
go
into
effect
on
september
delaying
levies
on
certain
consumer
technologies
like
cell
phones
laptop
computers
video
game
consoles
and
computer
monitors
until
december
based
on
health
safety
national
security
and
other
factors
it
is
unclear
whether
this
will
help
farmers
in
any
way
