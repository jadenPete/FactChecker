department
of
housing
and
urban
development
hud
is
set
to
move
forward
with
a
proposed
rule
change
that
would
essentially
allow
shelters
receiving
hud
grants
to
ignore
nondiscrimination
protections
for
unhoused
transgender
people
rep
jennifer
wexton
d-va
however
has
introduced
a
bill
to
block
that
rule
that
from
going
into
effect
members
will
consider
the
bill
once
congress
is
back
in
session
wexton's
bill
which
was
first
introduced
in
may
says
that
the
hud
secretary
can't
implement
administer
or
enforce
or
in
any
manner
make
effective
the
proposed
rule
or
any
final
rule
that
is
based
substantially
on
such
proposed
rule
after
the
bill
passed
through
the
house
financial
services
committee
in
june
wexton
said
in
a
statement
to
media
the
administration's
proposal
to
allow
discrimination
against
transgender
people
at
federally-funded
shelters
is
wrong
and
dangerous
shelters
save
lives
i
can't
overstate
how
dire
the
consequences
can
be
when
a
transgender
individual
seeking
emergency
shelter
is
turned
away
nearly
in
trans
people
said
they
had
experienced
homelessness
in
a
u.s.
transgender
survey
forty
percent
of
youths
served
by
the
country's
homeless
agencies
identify
as
lgbtq
the
williams
institute
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
also
found
hud's
regulatory
agenda
this
fall
includes
a
proposed
rule
that
says
shelters
which
receive
manage
or
operate
hud
grants
can
essentially
ignore
protections
that
were
covered
under
title
viii
of
the
civil
rights
act
during
the
obama
administration
hud
implemented
rules
that
clarified
protections
for
trans
people
under
the
law
in
hud
implemented
a
final
rule
referred
to
as
the
equal
access
rule
to
ensure
that
its
core
programs
are
open
to
all
eligible
individuals
and
families
regardless
of
sexual
orientation
gender
identity
or
marital
status
in
hud
issued
a
rule
that
clarified
that
sex-segregated
shelters
receiving
funding
must
also
adhere
to
the
equal
access
rule
under
this
proposed
rule
shelters
permitting
single-sex
or
sex-segregated
facilities
can
establish
a
policy
by
which
such
shelter
provider
considers
an
individual's
sex
for
the
purposes
of
determining
accommodation
within
such
shelters
and
for
purposes
of
determining
sex
for
admission
to
any
facility
or
portion
thereof
they
can
consider
factors
including
privacy
safety
practical
concerns
religious
beliefs
any
relevant
considerations
under
civil
rights
and
nondiscrimination
authorities
only
one
day
before
the
proposed
rule
was
released
wexton
asked
hud
secretary
ben
carson
if
he
anticipated
changes
to
the
equal
access
rule
and
he
responded
that
he
was
not
currently
anticipating
changing
the
rule
if
this
rule
goes
into
effect
trans
people
may
be
forced
to
make
the
impossible
choice
of
living
in
a
shelter
that
does
not
recognize
their
gender
or
foregoing
shelter
entirely
placing
them
in
potentially
dangerous
situations
either
way
legal
experts
have
said
that
the
rule
is
unconstitutional
and
likely
to
be
challenged
after
the
proposed
rule
was
announced
mara
keisling
head
of
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
ncte
said
in
a
statement
the
programs
impacted
by
this
rule
are
life-saving
for
transgender
people
particularly
youth
rejected
by
their
families
lack
of
stable
housing
fuels
the
violence
and
abuse
that
takes
the
lives
of
many
transgender
people
of
color
across
the
country
this
action
from
hud
is
the
latest
in
a
long
list
of
anti-trans
actions
from
the
trump
administration
in
august
the
labor
department
proposed
a
rule
that
allowing
broad
religious
exemptions
for
businesses
with
federal
contracts
which
could
undermine
the
rights
of
lgbtq
people
and
other
marginalized
groups
the
white
house
has
come
out
against
the
equality
act
a
sweeping
nondiscrimination
bill
which
would
clarify
and
expand
protections
for
the
lgbtq
community
in
employment
housing
education
public
accommodations
credit
and
lending
early
on
the
administration
decided
to
roll
back
obama-era
anti-discrimination
protections
for
transgender
students
it
has
implemented
a
ban
on
transgender
people
in
the
military
the
administration
has
also
rolled
back
protections
that
barred
healthcare
workers
and
insurance
companies
from
discriminating
against
trans
people
and
it
tried
to
implement
a
conscience
rule
that
would
allow
healthcare
workers
not
to
perform
treatments
they
object
to
on
religious
grounds
which
some
advocates
say
would
limit
reproductive
care
and
other
forms
of
healthcare
for
the
lgbtq
community
the
rule
has
been
challenged
in
a
california
court
and
the
trump
administration
has
agreed
to
postpone
implementation
