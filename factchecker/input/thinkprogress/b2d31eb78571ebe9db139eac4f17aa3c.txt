susan
collins
has
a
predictably
pathetic
response
to
el
paso
and
dayton
shootings
there
are
times
for
political
debate
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
sen
susan
collins
r-me
is
once
again
very
disappointed
amid
calls
for
action
to
stop
gun
violence
and
mass
shootings
she
told
right-wing
radio
host
hugh
hewitt
on
wednesday
that
it
is
extremely
disappointing
that
americans
want
action
now
collins
who
sometimes
bucks
her
party
on
gun
issues
but
is
most
often
there
when
the
senate
republican
leadership
needs
her
has
been
non-committal
on
specific
responses
to
the
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
over
the
weekend
asked
about
the
issue
by
hewitt
she
launched
an
attack
not
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
who
has
blocked
all
action
on
gun
safety
legislation
or
president
donald
trump
who
has
fueled
white
nationalist
violence
with
his
racist
rhetoric
but
on
the
activists
who
are
calling
for
change
to
the
status
quo
surely
this
is
the
time
when
we
could
put
aside
politics
and
come
together
and
our
leaders
could
act
as
one
to
give
our
condolences
to
the
victims
families
and
it's
just
it's
extremely
disappointing
she
complained
in
the
interview
posted
by
the
progressive
research
group
american
bridge
st
century
there
are
times
for
political
debate
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
but
there
have
been
more
than
mass
shootings
in
the
united
states
in
alone
according
to
the
gun
violence
archive
that
averages
out
to
more
than
one
every
single
day
if
collins
believes
it
is
inappropriate
to
discuss
reducing
gun
violence
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
a
mass
shooting
it
is
hard
to
imagine
when
such
times
for
political
debate
will
come
