three
of

vaccines

the

it

cbp
said
it

the

higher
flu

rate
for

kids

be
the

are
only
one
element
of
the
broader
migrant-detention
dragnet
trump's

has
expanded
but
there
is
little
reason
to
think
things
are
any
better
at

medical

commonplace
in

whether
they

who
committed

there
is
little
profit
in

after
all
horror
stories
about

leaving

needlessly

exposed

are
all
too
familiar

the

security
dhs
agencies
that
run
immigration
detention
facilities
at
the
border
and
in
the
interior
of
the
country
appear
to
be
particularly
egregious
in
their
handling
of
the
human
beings
they
cage
the
dhs
inspector
general
has
issued
multiple
reports
blasting
both
ice

cbp
over
the
unsanitary

and
lack
of

in

the
trump
administration
announced
plans
for
a
major
restructuring
of

detention
systems
on
wednesday
unveiling
regulations
intended
to
maintain
his
preferred
policy
of
indefinite
detention
even
for
families
with
small
children
the
new
policy
will
require
court
approval
and
lawsuits
to
stop
it
are
almost
certain
if
successful
however
the
move
would
end
a
long-standing
day
limit
on
the
detention
of
immigrant
children
under
an
important
court
agreement
known
as
flores
it
is
worth
noting
the
administration's
underlying
attitude
toward
the
people
it
has
targeted
for
such
expansive
detention
and
petty
quotidian
trauma
stephen

identified
as
the
man
in

of
executing
the
details
of

toward

has
openly
asserted
that
immigration
from

the

long
before

attached
the

to
it
a

of

if
you
saw
the
people
in
your
care
as
fully
human
flu
shots
ahead
of
flu
season
would
be
a
no-brainer
but
if
you
see
them
as
something
other
than

a
plague
an

a
foreign

that
makes
our

poorer

dirtier
why
would
