new
senate
report
confirms
the
fbi
was
one
of
nassar's
top
enablers
the
fbi
failed
to
pursue
a
course
of
action
that
would
have
immediately
protected
victims
in
harm's
way
congress
finds
last
month
sen
jerry
moran
r-ks
and
sen
richard
blumenthal
d-ct
released
a
congressional
report
confirming
that
multiple
institutions
failed
to
take
proper
action
to
stop
sexual
abuse
by
former
usa
gymnastics
and
michigan
state
doctor
larry
nassar
he
is
now
serving
a
veritable
life
sentence
in
prison
for
assaulting
more
than
people
primarily
young
female
patients
under
the
guise
of
medical
treatment
the
report
finds
the
fbi
failed
to
protect
victims
and
enabled
their
abuse
through
institutional
inaction
it's
been
clear
since
the
indianapolis
star
first
revealed
allegations
against
nassar
in
september
that
usa
gymnastics
usag
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
usoc
and
michigan
state
university
msu
could
have
prevented
some
of
the
abuse
if
they
had
acted
faster
but
this
page
report
the
result
of
an
month
investigation
by
the
u.s.
senate
committee
on
commerce
science
and
transportation
subcommittee
on
manufacturing
trade
and
consumer
protection
provides
the
clearest
portrait
yet
of
how
thoroughly
the
fbi
enabled
nassar's
abuse
the
congressional
report
finds
the
fbi
dragged
its
feet
on
the
investigation
itself
while
nassar
was
still
working
at
michigan
state
and
still
actively
abusing
patients
nassar
remained
employed
by
msu
for
days
after
the
fbi
received
a
report
from
usag
of
credible
allegations
against
nassar
on
july
the
report
states
usag
also
consulted
the
fbi
about
its
media
strategy
and
attempts
to
cover
up
the
investigation
into
the
allegations
against
nassar
according
to
the
report
the
report
also
highlights
the
close
relationship
between
usag
officials
and
fbi
agents
emails
included
in
the
report
show
usag
officials
were
trying
to
help
an
fbi
agent
leading
the
investigation
get
a
job
at
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
the
fbi
failed
to
pursue
a
course
of
action
that
would
have
immediately
protected
victims
in
harm's
way
says
the
report
instead
the
fbi's
investigation
dragged
on
and
was
shuffled
between
field
offices
while
nassar
continued
to
see
patients
at
msu
until
august
a
day
after
rachael
denhollander
filed
a
complaint
against
nassar
with
msu
police
the
fbi
was
first
notified
about
nassar
in
the
summer
of
that
june
gymnast
maggie
nichols
told
her
coach
sarah
jantzi
that
she
was
uncomfortable
with
nassar's
so-called
treatments
jantzi
reported
her
concerns
to
rhonda
faehn
then
the
head
of
usag's
women's
program
and
faehn
passed
these
concerns
on
to
steve
penny
who
was
the
president
of
usag
at
the
time
instead
of
going
directly
to
law
enforcement
on
july
penny
hired
human
resources
specialist
fran
sepler
to
investigate
the
allegations
sepler
spoke
with
nichols
as
well
as
olympians
aly
raisman
and
mckayla
maroney
finally
on
july
sepler
told
penny
that
he
should
report
nassar
to
law
enforcement
but
penny
waited
three
days
only
notifying
the
fbi
in
indianapolis
on
july
the
next
day
penny
then-vice
chair
of
usag
paul
parilla
and
then-usag
legal
counsel
scott
himsel
met
with
fbi
special
agent
in
charge
sac
jay
abbott
and
two
other
field
agents
at
the
fbi
office
in
indianapolis
this
is
where
things
start
looking
really
bad
for
the
fbi
parilla
told
the
senate
committee
that
abbott
said
on
several
occasions
that
usag
should
not
take
actions
that
would
interfere
with
the
fbi's
investigation
but
it
seems
like
the
fbi
was
not
clear
at
all
about
what
that
might
mean
parilla
did
not
recall
any
specific
conversation
where
the
fbi
prohibited
usag
from
sharing
information
about
the
investigation
with
msu
where
nassar
was
still
employed
and
seeing
patients
usag
used
those
vague
fbi
instructions
as
an
excuse
not
to
contact
msu
and
for
the
next
year
neither
usag
nor
the
fbi
took
steps
to
prevent
nassar
from
seeing
patients
outside
of
usag
according
to
the
new
york
times
nassar
abused
at
least
patients
during
that
time
over
the
next
six
weeks
usag
helped
the
fbi
agents
arrange
interviews
with
girls
who
said
nassar
abused
them
and
followed
up
a
few
times
on
september
abbott
emailed
penny
relaying
his
understanding
that
pertinent
interviews
have
been
completed
and
the
results
have
been
provided
to
the
fbi
and
the
usao
in
michigan
detroit
for
appropriate
action
if
any
but
after
that
the
investigation
appears
to
have
stalled
and
usag
did
not
hear
anything
else
from
the
fbi
so
the
next
spring
penny
and
parilla
met
with
fbi
agent
michael
hess
in
los
angeles
california
where
some
of
the
survivors
lived
hess
began
reaching
out
to
survivors
at
that
time
but
it
seemed
to
those
survivors
there
was
little
to
no
communication
between
the
fbi
office
in
indianapolis
and
the
fbi
office
in
los
angeles
mckayla
maroney
told
the
subcommittee
that
the
fbi
appeared
to
have
an
inaccurate
and
false
record
of
what
she
had
told
the
fbi
during
her
call
with
them
in
august
and
her
meeting
with
them
in
may
plus
the
interviews
lacked
a
sense
of
urgency
fbi
agents
worked
around
the
olympic
schedule
of
gymnasts
sarah
jantzi
maggie
nichols
former
coach
was
interviewed
by
hess
sometime
after
olympic
trials
which
was
likely
late
summer
of
jantzi's
report
to
usag
was
what
got
the
entire
investigation
started
it
seemed
odd
that
it
would
take
so
long
to
interview
her
and
still
it
seems
that
nobody
in
the
fbi
office
in
los
angeles
was
in
contact
with
the
fbi
office
in
lansing
michigan
where
nassar
was
still
working
lieutenant
andrea
mumford
of
the
msu
police
department
the
lead
investigator
in
the
michigan
case
against
nassar
said
her
first
interaction
with
the
fbi
happened
on
september
when
hess
told
her
that
the
fbi
was
investigating
nassar
for
federal
sex
crimes
involving
interstate
travel
this
was
after
denhollander
had
already
filed
her
criminal
complaint
to
the
msu
police
department
later
that
fall
when
mumford
and
other
members
of
the
local
police
force
executed
a
search
warrant
and
found
computer
devices
containing
child
pornography
they
handed
that
over
to
the
fbi
in
lansing
according
to
the
report
mumford
told
investigators
that
at
the
time
she
did
not
think
that
the
fbi
in
lansing
knew
about
nassar
the
congressional
report
also
mentions
that
as
of
right
now
the
fbi
has
not
yet
contacted
key
figures
at
michigan
state
who
allegedly
enabled
nassar's
abuse
including
former
msu
gymnastics
head
coach
kathy
klages
and
former
msu
doctor
brooke
lemmon
not
only
was
the
fbi
dragging
its
feet
on
the
investigation
but
it
was
also
helping
usag
keep
a
lid
on
nassar's
crimes
according
to
congressional
investigators
on
july
two
days
after
reporting
nassar
to
the
fbi
for
sexual
abuse
penny
emailed
agent
abbott
seeking
assistance
with
usag's
communication
with
nassar
in
that
email
penny
wrote
our
biggest
concern
is
how
we
contain
him
from
sending
shockwaves
through
the
community
penny
wanted
to
ensure
that
any
correspondence
with
nassar
was
consistent
with
fbi
protocol
abbott
responded
you
are
certainly
able
to
advise
dr
nasser
sic
as
you
deem
appropriate
and
we
in
no
way
want
to
hinder
that
or
lead
you
to
believe
you
must
follow
an
fbi
protocol
though
the
fbi
will
not
confirm
or
deny
any
ongoing
investigation
or
assessment
after
usag
reported
additional
concerns
to
the
fbi
in
los
angeles
in
the
spring
of
penny
emailed
hess
requesting
that
the
fbi
not
share
that
it
was
usag
that
made
the
report
against
nassar
he
wrote
if
there
is
any
way
you
can
not
sic
identify
that
usa
gymnastics
has
filed
the
complaint
against
nassar
when
you
talk
to
people
but
just
generally
suggest
that
a
complaint
has
been
filed
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
it
will
keep
things
on
a
much
more
level
playing
field
if
no
one
can
point
in
any
one
direction
it
is
unclear
how
the
fbi
responded
to
this
request
on
september
after
being
sent
a
round
of
questions
from
the
indianapolis
star
penny
forwarded
the
questions
to
the
fbi
and
expressed
his
desire
to
body-slam
the
reporters
investigating
nassar
the
subcommittee
released
emails
confirming
a
personal
relationship
between
penny
and
abbott
which
had
previously
been
reported
by
the
new
york
times
on
october
just
over
a
month
after
abbott
had
finished
his
interviews
for
the
nassar
investigation
abbott
emailed
penny
to
tell
him
also
just
another
quick
thank
you
for
the
beer
and
conversation
a
few
weeks
ago
i
very
much
appreciate
what
you
did
though
i
realize
there
would
be
many
qualified
applicants
the
position
with
the
usoc
is
truly
a
tantalizing
and
interesting
possible
opportunity
post-bureau
that
i
continue
to
think
about
according
to
the
congressional
report
a
year
and
a
half
after
this
exchange
penny
sent
abbott
a
text
message
on
february
containing
a
link
to
a
website
advertising
a
position
with
usoc
around
the
same
time
penny
and
abbott
were
sharing
beers
and
talking
about
job
opportunities
nassar
was
abusing
dozens
more
patients
from
his
office
right
on
the
msu
campus
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
still
need
to
be
brought
to
justice
for
their
enabling
of
nassar
the
fbi
is
no
exception
the
department
of
justice
opened
up
an
investigation
into
the
fbi's
handling
of
the
nassar
case
last
september
