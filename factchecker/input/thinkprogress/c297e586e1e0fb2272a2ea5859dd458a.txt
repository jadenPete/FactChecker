once
again
carli
lloyd
is
out-kicking
society's
expectations
for
women
the
soccer
star
says
she's
seriously
considering
pursuing
kicking
in
the
nfl
this
summer
players
on
the
u.s.
women's
national
soccer
team
inspired
people
around
the
world
when
they
won
a
second
consecutive
world
cup
championship
fighting
for
equal
pay
and
speaking
out
against
president
donald
trump's
hateful
rhetoric
and
policies
along
the
way
as
a
group
they
defied
expectations
and
expanded
boundaries
for
female
soccer
players
on
and
off
the
pitch
now
uswnt
star
carli
lloyd
is
doing
the
same
thing
on
a
different
playing
field
last
week
the
two-time
world
cup
champion
and
fifa
player
of
the
year
and
noted
philadelphia
eagles
fan
successfully
kicked
a
yard
field
goal
at
an
eagles
practice
the
feat
was
captured
on
video
and
quickly
went
viral
since
then
espn
reports
that
multiple
nfl
teams
have
reached
out
to
lloyd
one
even
invited
her
to
participate
in
a
preseason
game
but
she
declined
because
she's
playing
in
a
game
with
the
uswnt
on
the
same
day
however
she's
taking
the
possibility
seriously
i
am
having
discussions
with
my
husband
and
trainer
about
the
reality
of
playing
in
the
nfl
lloyd
told
fox
sports
they
both
feel
that
i
could
do
it
and
should
consider
it
so
i'm
seriously
considering
it
as
it's
a
challenge
some
have
dismissed
this
as
a
publicity
stunt
or
some
sort
of
sideshow
distraction
nfl
wide
receiver
keenan
allen
has
dismissed
her
chances
of
ever
making
a
roster
tweeting
that
if
one
of
lloyd's
kicks
were
ever
to
get
blocked
and
she
suddenly
were
playing
defense
it
would
look
like
the
stampede
scene
in
the
lion
king
sic
movie
but
critics
sell
lloyd
short
and
as
her
opponents
of
the
past
two
decades
know
all
too
well
selling
carli
lloyd
short
is
a
fool's
errand
first
of
all
lloyd
is
not
going
to
do
anything
unless
she's
fully
prepared
for
it
so
while
she
is
considering
the
nfl
an
option
she's
not
thinking
about
this
season
instead
she's
going
to
put
in
the
work
see
if
she
is
able
to
adjust
her
technique
to
fit
the
rules
that
placekickers
in
the
nfl
must
follow
and
decide
if
this
is
a
realistic
path
to
pursue
if
she
still
feels
confident
she
is
going
to
try
to
make
it
happen
for
the
season
not
the
season
which
begins
in
less
than
two
weeks
if
she's
going
to
do
this
she'll
do
it
she'll
train
in
the
offseason
she'll
get
herself
ready
so
that
she
just
doesn't
do
it
for
the
sake
of
doing
it
her
trainer
james
galanis
told
espn
if
she's
going
to
do
it
she's
going
to
do
it
so
that
she
can
be
a
success
she
is
after
all
a
professional
who
takes
her
reputation
incredibly
seriously
secondly
lloyd
would
not
be
the
first
female
to
be
a
placekicker
in
a
male-dominated
football
game
women
have
served
as
placekickers
in
football
games
on
the
high
school
collegiate
and
semi-professional
levels
not
surprisingly
many
of
these
women
excelled
at
soccer
too
in
liz
heaston
was
the
first
woman
to
play
and
score
in
a
college
football
game
when
she
kicked
two
extra
points
for
willamette
university
she
played
in
only
two
games
although
she
did
have
an
extended
career
as
a
soccer
player
for
willamette
in
tonya
butler
a
standout
placekicker
in
high
school
who
also
played
soccer
in
college
became
the
first
woman
to
score
a
field
goal
in
a
college
football
game
when
she
played
for
the
university
of
west
alabama
tigers
a
division
ii
school
in
the
ncaa
that
same
year
university
of
new
mexico's
katie
hnida
became
the
first
woman
to
play
in
a
division
i-a
bowl
when
she
attempted
an
extra
point
in
placekicker
becca
longo
became
the
first
woman
to
receive
a
scholarship
out
of
high
school
to
play
for
a
division
ii
ncaa
football
team
yes
those
examples
all
come
from
lower
levels
of
the
sport
but
they
also
involved
athletes
who
are
not
nearly
as
skilled
as
lloyd
she's
not
a
high
school
soccer
star
she's
a
two-time
world
champion
phenom
so
it
makes
sense
that
she
would
have
a
chance
to
break
through
at
a
more
advanced
level
and
really
that's
the
crux
of
it
lloyd's
elite
athleticism
and
championship
experience
set
her
apart
from
the
field
yes
nfl
kickers
are
under
an
immense
amount
of
scrutiny
but
lloyd
has
participated
in
shoot-outs
in
the
world
cup
so
she's
proven
her
mental
strength
yes
lloyd
would
need
to
change
her
technique
in
order
to
follow
nfl
guidelines
but
she
has
the
work
ethic
self
discipline
and
access
to
training
to
do
just
that
and
sure
when
a
kick
breaks
down
and
all
the
huge
men
come
running
towards
her
she's
not
the
most
likely
candidate
to
make
a
tackle
but
kickers
never
are
that's
not
why
they're
on
the
roster
lloyd
plays
a
physical
sport
and
isn't
afraid
of
contact
and
in
the
nfl
at
least
she
would
be
wearing
pads
and
a
helmet
ultimately
there
are
plenty
of
reasons
to
question
whether
lloyd
should
play
in
the
nfl
because
there
are
plenty
of
reasons
to
question
whether
anyone
of
any
gender
should
play
in
the
nfl
given
the
dangers
it
presents
it's
okay
to
feel
a
bit
uncomfortable
about
a
woman
suiting
up
in
an
nfl
game
and
potentially
being
tackled
by
a
bunch
of
men
and
it's
reasonable
to
feel
a
bit
skeptical
about
whether
anything
will
ever
come
from
this
discussion
after
all
lloyd
is
still
a
soccer
player
and
might
not
find
it
worth
her
time
to
pursue
this
but
lloyd
knows
that
if
she
does
she
won't
be
just
kicking
for
herself
she'll
be
representing
women
everywhere
who
are
trying
to
break
through
barriers
and
crack
glass
ceilings
she'll
be
kicking
to
help
us
all
open
our
minds
and
reassess
the
limitations
we
put
on
women
as
we
know
from
her
soccer
career
that
is
not
a
responsibility
she
takes
lightly
there's
no
reason
to
expect
this
would
be
any
different
i
don't
want
to
go
in
there
blindly
lloyd
told
nbcsports
philadelphia
i
want
to
actually
attempt
to
do
it
but
i
know
that
i
definitely
could
do
it
because
anything
i
set
my
mind
to
do
i
can
do
it
and
i
actually
do
kick
balls
for
a
living
