senate
republicans
plan
to
use
health
and
education
funding
the
signature
promise
of
donald
trump's
presidential
campaign
was
that
he
would
build
a
massive
wall
along
the
nation's
southern
border
and
that
not
a
penny
of
it
would
be
charged
to
the
american
taxpayer
he
repeatedly
boasted
that
he
would
get
mexico
to
pay
for
it
but
now
that
this
lie
has
been
all
but
abandoned
senate
republicans
reportedly
plan
to
divert
billions
of
dollars
from
health
and
education
to
make
up
the
difference
roll
call
reported
on
thursday
that
senate
appropriations
chairman
richard
shelby
r-al
has
written
a
fiscal
year
labor-hhs-education
spending
bill
allocation
that
is
about
billion
lower
than
it
would
have
been
to
provide
funding
for
the
wall
if
this
proposal
gets
the
votes
required
for
passage
in
the
senate
it
would
still
need
to
be
negotiated
with
the
democratic-controlled
house
of
representatives
shelby's
campaign
website
painted
him
as
a
champion
of
fiscal
responsibility
who
opposed
wasteful
government
spending
though
the
trump
administration
has
upgraded
sections
of
pre-existing
fencing
there
has
been
almost
no
construction
of
new
wall
segments
as
a
candidate
trump's
promise
that
mexico
would
fully
fund
his
border
wall
became
so
constant
that
his
supporters
chanted
it
at
his
rallies
though
he
vowed
he
would
do
something
very
severe
unless
they
contributed
or
gave
us
the
money
to
build
the
wall
and
that
it
would
be
completed
within
two
years
that
has
not
happened
in
january
he
changed
the
promise
to
mexico
would
pay
but
a
little
later
more
than
two-and-a-half
years
into
his
presidency
mexico
has
not
paid
a
cent
