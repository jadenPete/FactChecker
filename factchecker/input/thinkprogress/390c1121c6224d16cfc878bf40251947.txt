the
battle
to
save
gun
control
by
destroying
it
sometimes
the
only
way
to
fight
a
rogue
supreme
court
is
to
surrender
just
over
a
week
ago
two
mass
shooters
murdered
more
than
two
dozen
americans
in
a
single
weekend
bringing
the
total
number
of
u.s.
mass
shootings
incidents
in
which
a
person
with
a
gun
shot
four
or
more
people
to
at
least
this
year
while
the
nation
mourns
these
deaths
the
supreme
court
is
preparing
to
hear
a
case
that
could
gut
what
little
remains
of
american
gun-control
laws
the
case
new
york
state
rifle
pistol
association
v
city
of
new
york
will
be
the
first
second
amendment
case
heard
by
the
high
court
in
nearly
a
decade
and
the
first
such
case
it's
heard
since
brett
kavanaugh
took
over
the
seat
previously
held
by
the
more
moderate
conservative
justice
anthony
kennedy
it's
also
a
case
the
supreme
court
has
no
business
hearing
or
more
specifically
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
law
in
question
governed
where
new
york
city
residents
who
possess
a
specific
kind
of
permit
are
allowed
to
bring
their
guns
but
it's
no
longer
in
effect
indeed
the
new
york
city
licensing
regime
challenged
in
this
case
has
since
been
superseded
by
a
new
york
state
law
giving
the
plaintiffs
the
exact
same
relief
they
claim
to
seek
from
the
courts
if
the
supreme
court
follows
the
constitution
in
other
words
it
will
dismiss
this
case
as
a
general
rule
courts
do
not
sit
to
give
plaintiffs
something
that
they
already
have
the
open
question
is
whether
a
republican
court
eager
to
reshape
america's
gun
laws
will
reach
beyond
the
judiciary's
role
the
constitution
provides
that
the
judicial
power
extends
only
to
cases
or
controversies
a
requirement
that
limits
federal
courts
to
hearing
real
live
disputes
between
parties
the
doctrines
enforcing
this
case
or
controversy
requirement
are
known
collectively
as
justiciability
doctrines
plaintiffs
may
not
challenge
a
law
unless
they've
been
injured
in
some
way
by
that
law
a
requirement
known
as
standing
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
lawsuit
prematurely
their
case
may
be
dismissed
because
it
is
not
ripe
if
they
have
a
legitimate
dispute
against
a
defendant
but
then
that
dispute
ceases
to
exist
the
case
is
moot
new
york
state
rifle
has
a
mootness
problem
to
understand
why
it's
helpful
to
understand
some
of
the
details
of
new
york's
gun
licensure
regime
new
york
state
law
provides
for
several
different
kinds
of
gun
licenses
a
carry
license
permits
individual
to
carry
a
handgun
for
target
practice
hunting
or
self-defense
meanwhile
a
more
restrictive
premises
license
permits
someone
to
have
and
possess
a
gun
in
his
dwelling
people
with
premises
licenses
can
also
take
the
gun
out
of
the
home
but
only
for
limited
purposes
before
a
recent
amendment
new
york
state
law
gave
the
city
fairly
broad
discretion
to
decide
what
people
with
premises
licenses
could
do
with
their
guns
city
residents
with
premises
licenses
could
take
the
gun
to
seven
firing
ranges
within
the
city
but
not
to
similar
venues
outside
of
the
city
so
a
few
gun
owners
sued
claiming
the
right
to
in
the
words
of
the
appeals
court
that
heard
this
case
transport
their
handguns
to
shooting
ranges
and
competitions
outside
new
york
city
after
the
supreme
court
announced
it
would
hear
this
case
new
york
state
amended
its
law
to
take
away
much
of
the
city's
discretion
among
other
things
the
law
now
specifically
permits
people
with
premises
licenses
to
bring
their
guns
to
an
indoor
or
outdoor
shooting
range
that
is
authorized
by
law
to
operate
as
such
and
to
a
lawful
shooting
competition
so
the
state
surrendered
and
the
plaintiffs
got
the
relief
they
want
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
case
indeed
the
supreme
court
confronted
a
nearly
identical
case
in
that
case
department
of
treasury
v
galioto
involved
a
federal
firearms
statute
that
prevented
someone
who
had
been
committed
to
any
mental
institution
from
purchasing
a
firearm
while
the
case
was
pending
indeed
after
the
case
was
argued
before
the
supreme
court
congress
amended
the
law
to
lift
the
strict
ban
on
selling
guns
to
such
persons
although
a
weaker
ban
still
exists
accordingly
the
supreme
court
determined
that
the
case
was
moot
as
it
was
in
galioto
so
it
should
be
in
new
york
state
rifle
both
cases
involve
firearms
laws
amended
while
a
case
was
pending
to
eliminate
the
legal
dispute
that
inspired
the
case
if
the
supreme
court
follows
its
own
precedent
new
york
state
rifle
will
be
dismissed
conservative
judges
and
justices
spent
much
of
the
last
several
decades
railing
against
decisions
that
read
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
narrowly
when
the
supreme
court
held
in
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
had
an
obligation
to
address
certain
greenhouse
emissions
chief
justice
john
roberts
was
livid
apparently
dissatisfied
with
the
pace
of
progress
on
this
issue
in
the
elected
branches
petitioners
have
come
to
the
courts
claiming
broad-ranging
injury
he
complained
adding
that
he
would
reject
these
challenges
as
nonjusticiable
just
last
june
roberts
wrote
for
his
republican
colleagues
that
partisan
gerrymandering
cases
are
nonjusticiable
more
or
less
because
he
deemed
them
too
difficult
the
seminal
supreme
court
opinion
defining
the
limited
scope
of
the
standing
doctrine
was
authored
by
justice
antonin
scalia
just
last
term
trump-appointed
justice
neil
gorsuch
lectured
his
colleagues
on
mootness
in
a
dissenting
opinion
this
court
is
not
in
the
business
of
deciding
abstract
questions
no
matter
how
interesting
gorsuch
demanded
adding
that
if
the
legal
questions
here
are
of
sufficient
importance
a
live
case
presenting
them
will
come
along
soon
enough
there
is
no
need
to
press
the
bounds
of
our
constitutional
authority
to
reach
them
today
limiting
courts
jurisdiction
as
scalia
wrote
while
he
was
still
a
lower
court
judge
prevents
an
overjudicialization
of
the
processes
of
self-governance
it
is
one
of
several
ways
that
the
constitution
prevents
judges
from
imposing
their
will
on
the
two
branches
that
actually
must
stand
for
election
now
that
republicans
have
a
lock
on
the
supreme
court
however
it's
far
from
clear
that
this
belief
in
courts
limited
power
will
hold
the
groups
urging
the
supreme
court
to
ignore
its
longstanding
mootness
doctrine
in
new
york
state
rifle
include
not
just
gun
owners
but
prominent
anti-government
groups
and
the
nation's
preeminent
christian
right
law
firm
after
all
why
would
you
want
to
restrict
the
power
of
the
judiciary
when
it's
controlled
by
your
friends
in
fairness
there
is
a
doctrine
known
as
voluntary
cessation
which
allows
courts
to
hold
onto
a
case
after
the
defendant
voluntarily
quits
whatever
behavior
led
to
them
being
sued
in
the
first
place
it's
a
sensible
doctrine
because
it
prevents
defendants
from
endlessly
avoiding
litigation
by
doing
something
illegal
and
then
stopping
their
illegal
behavior
for
just
long
enough
for
a
court
to
dismiss
any
lawsuits
against
them
yet
whatever
the
merits
of
this
doctrine
it
does
not
apply
to
new
york
state
rifle
as
a
group
of
law
professors
explain
in
an
amicus
brief
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
new
york
city
but
a
law
preventing
the
city
from
restricting
the
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
was
enacted
by
new
york
state
the
issue
here
in
other
words
is
not
that
new
york
city
ceased
its
allegedly
illegal
activity
it's
that
a
higher
power
stepped
in
and
forced
them
to
stop
if
the
supreme
court
decides
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
be
more
expansive
now
that
republicans
have
consolidated
power
the
impact
will
be
widespread
to
take
just
one
high-profile
example
a
federal
judge
in
texas
held
that
the
entire
affordable
care
act
must
be
repealed
on
a
highly
dubious
legal
theory
among
the
many
problems
with
this
case
the
plaintiffs
rest
their
lawsuit
on
a
claim
that
they
were
injured
by
a
provision
of
the
law
that
literally
does
nothing
these
plaintiffs
in
other
words
lack
standing
to
bring
their
suit
as
least
as
the
concept
of
standing
has
long
been
understood
new
york
state
rifle
will
be
an
early
warning
sign
it
will
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
whether
the
republican
supreme
court
will
open
the
floodgates
to
aggressive
uses
of
judicial
power
like
this
obamacare
case
and
it's
also
an
important
case
in
its
own
right
if
the
supreme
court
reaches
the
merits
in
new
york
state
rifle
there
are
almost
certainly
five
votes
to
dismantle
much
of
america's
gun
laws
