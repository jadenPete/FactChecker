the
next
day
in
new
middletown
ohio
police
arrested
a
self-described
white
nationalist
who
had
also
participated
in
the
unite
the
right
rally
james
reardon
had
amassed
an
arsenal
of
weapons
and
had
threatened
a
local
jewish
community
center
but
the
threats
haven't
stopped
there
on
monday
it
was
revealed
that
the
same
day
that
wix
was
arrested
authorities
in
memphis
tennessee
took
year-old
truck
driver
thomas
mcvicker
into
custody
for
making
credible
threats
to
conduct
a
mass
shooting
mcvicker
had
allegedly
planned
to
shoot
up
a
church
in
tennessee
then
turn
the
gun
on
himself
the
next
day
authorities
in
pennington
county
south
dakota
arrested
a
man
who
was
planning
to
attack
local
and
federal
government
entities
it
was
revealed
the
same
day
that
police
in
new
jersey
arrested
year-old
jospeh
rubino
for
possessing
a
stockpile
of
assault
weapons
including
a
grenade
launcher
when
they
searched
his
home
authorities
also
discovered
neo-nazi
paraphernalia
and
a
document
containing
racist
material
and
purporting
to
be
an
instruction
manual
for
owning
a
slave
news
of
rubino's
july
arrest
only
became
public
this
week
police
only
discovered
rubino's
arsenal
after
he
wrecked
his
van
while
driving
it
and
officers
assisting
him
noticed
weapons
and
ammunition
in
the
rear
of
the
vehicle
around
the
same
time
that
rubino's
arrest
became
public
federal
authorities
announced
the
arrest
of
eric
lin
who
allegedly
sent
a
barrage
of
messages
to
an

in

outlining
how
he
wanted
the
extermination
of
all
hispanics
lin
also
posted
in
july
that
i
thank
god
everyday
president
donald
john
trump
is
president
and
that
he
will
launch
a
racial
war
and
crusade
he
has
been
charged
with
making
threatening
communications
the
barrage
of
threats
demonstrates
how
each
mass
shooting
provides
a
source
of
inspiration
for
additional
would-be
attackers
this
is
particularly
true
of
far-right
shooters
who
sometimes
post
extremist
manifestos
that
give
other
radicalized
people
tactical
knowledge
and
motivation
which
accelerate
fresh
attacks
law
enforcement
however
is
picking
up
the
pace
of
their
response
after
the
el
paso
attack
fbi
director
christopher
wray
ordered
field
offices
across
the
country
to
conduct
further
threat
assessments
in
order
to
help
local
law
enforcement
prevent
further
attacks
the
agency
said
it
was
worried
that
the
attacks
could
inspire
other
would-be
shooters
to
engage
in
similar
acts
of
violence
