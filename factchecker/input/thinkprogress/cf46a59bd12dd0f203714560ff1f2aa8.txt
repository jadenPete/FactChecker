creator
of
new
york
times
slavery
project
not
surprised
by
conservative
meltdown
nikole
hannah-jones
made
a
case
for
putting
enslaved
africans
at
the
center
of
america's
origins
story
a
lot
of
white
conservatives
threw
a
fit
nikole
hannah-jones
the
new
york
times
correspondent
and
the
visionary
behind
its
ambitious
examination
of
racial
issues
stemming
from
the
arrival
of
enslaved
people
in
the
english
colonies
isn't
the
least
bit
surprised
by
the
meltdown
among
white
conservatives
reacting
to
her
recasting
american
history
with
african
americans
and
slavery
at
the
forefront
the
whole
reason
we
did
the
project
in
the
first
place
is
because
our
society
has
been
unwilling
to
grapple
with
the
legacy
of
slavery
with
the
centrality
of
slavery
to
the
development
of
the
united
states
hannah-jones
said
in
an
interview
monday
on
msnbc's
all
in
with
chris
hayes
so
this
isn't
shocking
to
me
her
remarks
came
in
reaction
to
uproar
over
the
project
which
launched
on
sunday
and
reframed
american
history
in
the
context
of
the
th
anniversary
this
month
of
the
arrival
of
a
ship
carrying
enslaved
africans
into
a
port
near
hampton
virginia
in
a
series
of
essays
and
narrative
accounts
the
project
makes
the
point
that
overlooked
and
discredited
contributions
of
african
americans
began
with
that
historical
marker
and
continues
into
the
present-day
state
of
u.s.
society
predictably
conservative
activists
rushed
to
condemn
the
project
often
boldly
stating
their
opposition
without
reading
it
or
comprehending
its
contents
for
example
arch-conservative
commentator
eric
erickson
inaccurately
described
the
project's
authors
as
opinion
writers
who
profit
from
seeing
things
through
racial
lenses
and
keeping
racial
tension
aflame
as
much
as
trump
does
in
fact
only
one
of
the
project's
authors
is
an
opinion
writer
new
york
times
columnist
jamelle
bouie
and
most
are
journalists
and
historians
well
steeped
in
writing
about
america's
racial
past
and
present
a
common
complaint
among
many
of
the
conservative
critics
was
that
the
project
struck
them
as
an
attack
on
president
donald
trump
as
the
washington
examiner's
byron
york
argued
in
a
recent
column
in
her
interview
hannah-jones
brushed
aside
such
critiques
as
ridiculous
anyone
who
would
call
this
a
propaganda
tool
or
that
somehow
i'd
spent
you
know
since
february
working
on
this
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
because
we
the
new
york
times
wanted
to
get
trump
is
of
course
ridiculous
hannah-jones
said
we
didn't
plan
the
anniversary
to
happen
in
august
of
just
so
it
would
coincide
with
trump's
issues
with
being
called
a
racist
instead
hannah-jones
explained
that
the
project
excavates
our
true
nature
and
is
in
direct
opposition
to
our
founding
myths
and
she
said
that
is
why
there
has
been
such
a
negative
reaction
among
many
white
conservatives
who
want
to
cling
to
a
version
of
american
history
that
places
them
at
the
exclusive
center
of
the
story
i
think
what
a
lot
of
conservatives
want
is
they
want
to
choose
which
parts
of
our
path
we
remember
and
which
parts
of
our
path
we
forget
she
said
and
i
don't
understand
why
people
are
so
afraid
of
we're
simply
revealing
the
truth
about
our
country
