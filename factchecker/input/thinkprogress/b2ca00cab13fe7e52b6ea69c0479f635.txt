ethics
experts
throw
cold
water
on
trump's
offer
to
host
the
next
g
summit
the
only
way
he
could
host
the
summit
and
stay
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
make
everything
free
following
the
fracas
and
infighting
at
the
most
recent
g
summit
president
donald
trump
previewed
an
idea
for
how
to
make
sure
the
next
one
is
somehow
even
worse
hosting
it
at
the
trump
national
doral
miami
a
florida
resort
he
owns
and
profits
from
after
claiming
that
he
lost
up
to
billion
by
deciding
to
be
president
trump
pitched
the
idea
on
the
final
day
of
this
week's
summit
in
france
describing
the
miami-based
resort
as
a
great
place
to
host
next
year's
summit
it's
got
tremendous
acreage
many
hundreds
of
acres
so
we
can
handle
whatever
happens
trump
said
it's
really
people
are
really
liking
it
and
plus
it
has
buildings
that
have
to
units
and
so
each
delegation
can
have
its
own
building
trump
sounding
like
a
timeshare
salesman
further
pointed
to
the
hotel's
location
near
miami's
main
airport
nothing
trump
said
could
compare
it's
a
great
area
he
added
we
haven't
found
anything
that
could
even
come
close
to
competing
it
really
competing
with
it
especially
when
you
look
at
the
location
being
right
next
to
the
airport
just
one
problem
though
if
the
g
summit
is
hosted
at
trump
doral
the
president
will
directly
make
money
from
all
the
business
ginned
up
by
the
summit
more
than
that
the
president
would
gain
financially
from
foreign
dignitaries
and
their
entourage
that
could
violate
the
emoluments
clause
of
the
constitution
which
prevents
the
president
from
receiving
any
financial
payment
or
emolument
from
foreign
officials
trump
has
already
been
accused
of
not
only
profiting
directly
from
his
business
while
in
office
but
of
allowing
foreign
governments
to
curry
favor
by
spending
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
if
not
more
at
hotels
linked
to
trump
for
instance
foreign
officials
from
saudi
arabia
to
nigeria
can't
seem
to
resist
staying
at
trump's
d.c.
hotel
nbc
news
in
june
found
that
representatives
from
more
than
different
countries
had
already
spent
money
at
trump
properties
during
his
presidency
and
those
are
only
the
ones
we
know
about
as
thinkprogress
has
reported
trump-branded
properties
continue
to
make
money
from
purchases
made
by
anonymous
shell
companies
companies
that
could
be
secretly
owned
by
anyone
foreign
official
or
otherwise
according
to
the
miami
herald
the
trump
doral
property
has
been
among
his
most
profitable
assets
but
it
has
been
less
of
a
money-maker
since
he
became
president
trump
reported
that
he
made
million
from
the
doral
resort
and
golf
club
in
down
from
million
in
a
potential
g
summit
though
would
be
the
highest-profile
event
yet
hosted
at
a
trump-branded
property
during
trump's
presidency
as
well
as
an
unprecedented
moment
in
american
history
if
he's
going
to
charge
any
money
to
any
of
those
foreign
governments
for
room
or
for
services
or
for
playing
golf
for
anything
he's
in
violation
of
the
emoluments
clause
of
the
constitution
said
richard
painter
the
former
chief
ethics
lawyer
for
president
george
w.
bush
no
president
has
ever
had
a
for-profit
business
where
he
hosted
events
for
foreign
leaders
other
ethics
experts
echoed
painter's
assessment
the
idea
that
trump
doral
would
even
be
a
finalist
so
strongly
suggests
the
possibility
of
corruption
that
the
state
department's
inspector
general
should
investigate
the
procurement
process
walter
shaub
a
former
director
of
the
office
of
government
ethics
told
the
new
york
times
this
may
also
implicate
constitutional
concerns
if
the
government
is
going
to
be
paying
a
company
that
trump
owns
it's
unclear
what
steps
if
any
can
be
taken
to
prevent
trump
from
continuing
to
lobby
to
host
the
g
summit
at
the
location
next
year
however
according
to
painter
there's
one
clear
way
for
trump
to
avoid
potentially
violating
the
emoluments
clause
offer
everything
at
the
summit
for
free
if
he
wants
to
do
it
for
free
and
comp
everything
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
emoluments
clause
painter
said
if
he
wants
to
comp
it
that's
fine
