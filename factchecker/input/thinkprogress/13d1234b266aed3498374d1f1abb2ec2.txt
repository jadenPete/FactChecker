candidates
tell
the
trans
community
how
they
will
advocate
for
them
candidates
for
the
democratic
nomination
are
acknowledging
the
struggles
transgender
people
face
a
handful
of
presidential
candidates
say
the
needs
of
transgender
americans
deserve
more
attention
and
they're
making
them
an
issue
on
the
campaign
trail
three
candidates
for
the
democratic
nomination
spoke
at
length
recently
with
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
action
fund
about
how
their
policies
on
health
care
education
and
justice
would
affect
transgender
people
the
action
fund
provided
a
transcript
of
a
forum
called
transform
the
white
house
during
their
interviews
sens
kirsten
gillibrand
d-ny
cory
booker
d-nj
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
demonstrated
that
they
have
been
thinking
about
how
trans
people
are
uniquely
impacted
by
government
policies
on
health
justice
and
education
shelby
chestnut
director
of
policy
and
programs
at
the
transgender
law
center
said
it's
important
that
candidates
make
clear
that
they
are
aware
of
all
of
the
ways
the
trump
administration
has
rolled
back
obama-era
protections
for
transgender
people
this
includes
guidance
by
the
departments
of
education
and
justice
that
protected
trans
kids
from
discrimination
in
the
classroom
it
also
includes
a
proposed
rule
at
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
to
reverse
protections
for
trans
people
trying
to
access
health
care
and
efforts
at
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
that
would
allow
discrimination
at
shelters
i
think
what
people
aren't
realizing
is
how
severely
under
attack
trans
people
are
with
the
current
administration
and
that
any
administration
that
would
be
coming
in
must
take
swift
action
to
reverse
anything
that
has
happened
to
trans
people
said
chestnut
who
did
not
directly
address
policy
prescriptions
from
any
of
the
three
candidates
booker
acknowledged
the
damage
that
the
trump
administration
has
done
and
emphasized
the
serious
impact
these
policies
have
on
the
lives
of
trans
people
he
was
especially
critical
of
an
hhs
rule
that
would
revise
section
of
the
affordable
care
act
so
that
protections
against
sex
discrimination
no
longer
would
cover
transgender
people
he
appeared
to
condemn
the
conscience
rule
that
allows
health-care
providers
to
discriminate
against
trans
people
by
invoking
their
rights
to
religious
freedom
we
have
to
number
one
fight
on
these
issues
but
make
people
understand
that
this
is
vital
to
health
and
wellbeing
and
often
life
or
death
issues
for
me
my
commitment
is
not
just
trying
to
stop
it
if
he's
successful
roll
back
what
this
administration
has
done
but
we
have
a
lot
more
advances
that
we
have
to
do
booker
said
the
discrimination
from
insurance
companies
and
discrimination
from
employers
who
want
to
use
religious
exemptions
and
deny
people
fundamental
basic
health
care
is
unacceptable
to
me
it
shows
you
how
much
further
we
have
to
go
to
stop
the
backsliding
of
this
administration
but
more
importantly
to
advance
and
gained
ground
until
we
have
equal
health
care
access
for
all
he
said
he
also
referred
to
some
of
the
administration's
first
rollbacks
of
protections
for
trans
people
at
the
education
department
and
justice
department
which
he
called
awful
acts
sanders
also
alluded
to
some
of
these
attacks
in
my
office
and
around
the
country
we've
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
a
lot
of
trans
people
and
to
understand
that
in
today's
climate
with
trump
as
president
there
is
an
incredible
amount
of
fear
and
justified
anxiety
in
the
trans
community
he
said
gillibrand
talked
about
a
transgender
boy
she
knew
through
his
entire
grade
school
and
her
fury
that
the
trump
administration
has
in
effect
demeaned
and
dismissed
him
through
rollbacks
of
protections
for
trans
students
she
also
referred
to
the
president's
trans-military
ban
he
needs
to
know
that
he
is
loved
that
he
is
welcomed
that
he
can
identify
exactly
the
way
he
is
meant
to
identify
she
said
and
i
hate
the
fact
that
our
president
doesn't
value
him
and
so
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
wanted
to
run
for
president
because
i
am
so
against
the
hatred
and
the
vile
name-calling
and
the
disregard
he
has
for
transgender
americans
gillibrand
continued
look
what
he's
done
to
the
transgender
men
and
women
serving
in
our
military
a
man
who
has
never
served
has
told
men
and
women
that
their
service
is
not
worthy
based
on
their
gender
identity
chestnut
said
it's
important
that
candidates
understand
the
dangers
transgender
people
face
from
violence
on
the
street
violence
from
police
and
violence
within
the
immigration
system
at
least
transgender
people
have
been
shot
or
killed
by
other
means
so
far
this
year
according
to
the
human
rights
campaign
in
at
least
transgender
people
were
killed
the
vast
majority
of
those
killed
were
black
transgender
women
and
some
trans
women
have
faced
violence
or
even
death
at
the
hands
of
the
criminal
justice
system
we're
at
a
moment
where
most
people
candidates
specifically
should
be
thinking
about
how
to
help
trans
people
in
a
broad
decriminalization
framework
and
then
i
think
within
that
certain
categories
need
to
be
highlighted
to
a
much
greater
degree
than
they
are
chestnut
said
specifically
i
think
there's
a
large
movement
toward
decriminalizing
sex
work
but
i
think
that
should
be
connected
to
protecting
trans
sex
workers
and
not
just
decriminalization
to
get
at
the
root
of
discriminatory
policing
they
continued
then
there's
a
whole
broad
category
that
is
a
violent
epidemic
that
is
multi-year
and
probably
at
this
point
multi-decade
of
targeting
and
killing
of
black
trans
women
which
i
think
really
goes
unnoticed
by
most
folks
sanders
meanwhile
said
there
should
be
some
kind
of
built-in
incentive
for
police
departments
to
improve
their
practices
and
prevent
harm
to
trans
people
he
added
that
more
financial
resources
and
legal
help
should
be
provided
to
police
departments
what
we
want
to
do
is
provide
incentives
for
police
departments
around
the
country
to
do
the
right
thing
and
that
means
to
use
lethal
force
as
police
departments
police
officers
as
rarely
as
possible
to
understand
that
we
can
deal
with
disturbances
in
ways
that
do
not
require
shooting
people
and
also
to
protect
people
such
as
the
trans
community
who
need
protecting
he
said
for
his
part
booker
commended
the
obama
administration's
task
force
on
st
century
policing
i
would
want
to
do
more
than
that
to
start
focusing
and
pulling
together
folks
who
make
recommendations
when
it
comes
to
the
lgbtq
community
in
general
and
policing
and
then
start
to
look
at
federal
prisons
he
said
booker
cited
a
spate
of
violent
attacks
against
transgender
americans
this
year
during
the
first
democratic
presidential
debate
this
year
he
also
mentioned
the
murders
of
black
trans
people
this
is
something
that
should
have
everyone
in
this
country
concerned
and
frankly
outraged
your
community
is
being
disproportionately
targeted
with
heinous
acts
of
violence
i'm
going
to
be
someone
that
speaks
to
this
crisis
and
begins
to
take
specific
measures
to
do
something
about
that
booker
said
he
added
i
will
be
a
president
that
is
a
very
aggressive
in
calling
out
these
issues
and
putting
forward
the
best
of
who
we
are
to
stop
this
kind
of
targeting
harassment
violence
and
murder
sanders
agreed
i
know
that
the
trans
community
has
been
in
sometimes
very
violent
and
deadly
ways
been
a
victim
of
that
hatred
he
said
so
we
will
provide
all
of
the
legal
protection
that
we
possibly
can
to
protect
the
trans
community
and
to
protect
anybody
else
who
was
being
subjected
to
hate
crimes
and
bullying
chestnut
said
they
would
like
to
see
more
candidates
tackle
the
issue
of
trans
people
suffering
in
immigration
detention
a
analysis
from
the
center
for
american
progress
shows
that
lgbtq
people
in
u.s.
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
custody
are
times
more
likely
to
face
sexual
violence
than
people
who
are
not
in
the
lgbtq
community
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
project
of
the
center
for
american
progress
action
fund
detention
should
be
ended
for
all
people
but
particularly
a
population
that
is
so
vulnerable
and
who
have
faced
decades
of
violence
who
for
who
they
are
where
if
they
go
back
to
their
country
of
origin
would
likely
be
harmed
or
killed
chestnut
said
booker
said
criticized
the
private
prisons
used
by
ice
to
detain
immigrants
so
for
me
this
it
has
an
urgency
because
right
now
as
we
sit
here
there
are
trans
americans
who
are
suffering
at
the
hands
of
an
unjust
system
that
feeds
upon
vulnerable
populations
he
said
chestnut
added
that
broad
economic
and
justice
reform
would
also
help
the
most
marginalized
transgender
americans
for
example
chestnut
said
low-income
trans
people
with
hiv
need
broad
access
to
health
care
in
the
area
of
criminal
justice
ending
pretrial
detention
and
cash
bail
would
save
thousands
of
trans
people's
lives
every
single
year
they
said
that
part
of
what
candidates
need
to
do
is
demonstrate
that
they
will
meet
with
trans
people
particularly
trans
people
of
color
and
speak
about
trans
people
in
a
less
strained
way
as
they
would
about
any
other
group
they
are
fighting
for
i
don't
think
the
general
public
as
a
whole
understands
trans
people's
issues
and
just
basic
human
dignity
for
trans
people
chestnut
said
i
think
part
of
it
is
public
awareness
and
candidates
need
to
not
only
have
policies
protecting
trans
people
but
learn
how
to
talk
about
trans
people
in
humanizing
way
instead
of
a
subcategory
that
they
awkwardly
reference
usually
wrongly
in
a
campaign
speech
in
that
respect
gillibrand
communicated
a
passion
for
protecting
trans
people's
rights
and
her
interest
in
changing
the
cultural
conversation
about
trans
people
to
foster
more
acceptance
i
want
transgender
americans
to
know
that
i
am
their
voice
that
i
will
lift
up
their
stories
i
will
protect
them
i
will
protect
transgender
kids
as
if
they
were
my
own
children
it's
who
i
am
it's
what
i
believe
and
i
want
other
democrats
to
be
put
on
notice
that
these
are
issues
they
need
to
lead
on
she
said
if
you
see
how
much
violence
and
hate
is
being
spewed
out
against
lgbtq
americans
particularly
transgender
women
and
transgender
women
of
color
i
think
we
can
raise
up
those
stories
so
more
people
can
have
compassion
can
have
empathy
and
can
understand
that
this
is
a
human
right
that
has
to
be
protected
gillibrand
added
and
you
can
do
that
with
the
bully
pulpit
that's
what
the
presidency
is
about
changing
the
conversation
in
a
country
when
it
needs
to
change
and
bringing
people
along
with
you
