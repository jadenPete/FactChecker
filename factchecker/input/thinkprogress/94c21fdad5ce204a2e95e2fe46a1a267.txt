dan
crenshaw
r-tx
an
nra-backed
gun-rights
advocate
dismissed
calls
for
universal
background
checks
even
after
a
mass
shooting
in
his
own
state
that
might
have
been
prevented
by
such
a
law
his
reasoning
he
wants
to
be
able
to
arm
his
friends
abc
news
reported
on
tuesday
that
the
suspected
gunman
in
a
deadly
labor
day
mass
shooting
in
odessa
and
midland
texas
had
previously
failed
a
firearms
background
check
but
had
been
able
to
get
an
ar-type
assault
rifle
in
a
private
sale
through
the
gun-show
loophole
without
a
background
check
he
allegedly
used
the
weapon
to
kill
seven
people
and
injure
more
than
before
police
killed
him
like
many
other
nra-backed
lawmakers
crenshaw
opposed
a
universal
background
checks
bill
earlier
this
year
claiming
that
all
of
the
tragedies
we've
seen
whether
parkland
or
sutherland
springs
or
the
thousand
oaks
tragedy
or
sandy
hook
none
of
those
would
have
been
prevented
by
a
universal
background
checks
law
but
now
that
the
latest
texas
mass
shooting
undermined
his
narrative
crenshaw
made
a
new
argument
on
tuesday
with
universal
background
checks
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
let
my
friends
borrow
my
handgun
when
they
travel
alone
like
this
we
would
make
felons
out
of
people
just
for
defending
themselves
he
tweeted
it
is
unclear
why
crenshaw
does
not
believe
his
friends
could
pass
background
checks
to
get
their
own
weapons
or
to
borrow
his
if
they
are
convicted
felons
who
are
not
allowed
to
possess
weapons
it
would
seem
important
for
crenshaw
or
other
friends
to
know
that
before
arming
them
elisa
cardnell
a
democrat
running
against
crenshaw
in
told
thinkprogress
that
she
strongly
disagrees
with
the
incumbent's
view
if
you
can't
pass
a
background
check
you
shouldn't
have
a
gun
she
explained
in
a
statement
it's
as
simple
as
that
this
is
all
part
of
a
repeated
pattern
of
dangerous
and
irresponsible
rhetoric
from
him
regarding
gun
safety
dan
crenshaw
voted
against
universal
background
checks
because
he
cares
more
about
the
nra
than
our
communities
we
need
universal
background
checks
and
other
common
sense
gun
safety
legislation
