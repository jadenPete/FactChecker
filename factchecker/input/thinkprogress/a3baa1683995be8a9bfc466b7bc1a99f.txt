it
sure
looks
like
trump
is
subverting
the
succession
process
to
put
a
loyalist
in
charge
of
intel
it's
the
latest
skirmish
in
an
ongoing
war
between
trump
and
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
the
white
house
signaled
this
week
that
it
may
choose
a
loyalist
as
interim
director
of
national
intelligence
after
departing
director
dan
coats
steps
down
on
august
under
current
law
coats
would
be
replaced
by
sue
gordon
principal
deputy
director
of
national
intelligence
and
a
widely
respected
career
official
until
the
senate
can
confirm
a
permanent
replacement
but
the
white
house
has
asked
the
office
of
director
of
national
intelligence
for
a
list
of
its
senior
officials
signaling
that
it
could
be
looking
for
an
interim
head
who
is
more
ideologically
loyal
to
trump
the
news
reported
friday
by
the
daily
beast
confirms
an
earlier
report
by
cnn
that
the
white
house
is
looking
to
bypass
the
line
of
succession
in
order
to
name
a
different
acting
intelligence
chief
that
might
not
even
be
legal
as
cnn
reported
senate
intelligence
committee
chair
richard
burr
r-nc
whose
committee
oversees
the
u.s.
intelligence
committee
told
cnn
that
the
president
can
choose
whomever
he
wants
though
burr
went
on
to
praise
gordon
well
the
white
house
certainly
has
that
ability
but
she's
more
than
capable
of
handling
that
job
burr
told
cnn
i
would
be
shocked
because
that's
what
principal
deputies
are
in
place
for
trump
had
nominated
rep
john
ratcliffe
r-tx
a
vocal
defender
of
the
president
to
replace
coats
on
a
permanent
basis
but
announced
friday
he
was
withdrawing
the
nomination
ratcliffe
had
minimal
relevant
experience
and
members
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
raised
concerns
about
his
fitness
for
the
job
ratcliffe
faced
allegations
that
he
grossly
overstated
his
involvement
in
a
terrorism
financing
prosecution
one
of
the
main
qualifications
his
supporters
have
pointed
to
as
he
runs
to
lead
the
nation's
intelligence
agencies
but
ratcliffe
was
likely
the
nominee
because
he
proved
himself
a
capable
centurion
for
the
president
at
public
testimony
by
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
last
month
for
example
ratcliffe
lit
into
the
special
counsel
and
suggested
that
parts
of
his
investigation
that
focused
on
potential
obstruction
of
justice
by
trump
might
have
been
illegal
for
the
justice
department
to
pursue
it
was
written
to
a
legal
standard
that
does
not
exist
at
the
justice
department
ratcliffe
said
at
the
time
and
it
was
written
in
violation
of
every
doj
principle
about
extra-prosecutorial
commentary
the
special
counsel
was
appointed
under
rules
established
after
the
investigation
into
former
president
bill
clinton
and
a
federal
appeals
court
affirmed
that
mueller's
appointment
was
valid
i
agree
with
the
chairman
this
morning
when
he
said
donald
trump
is
not
above
the
law
he's
not
ratcliffe
added
but
he
damn
sure
shouldn't
be
below
the
law
which
is
where
volume
two
of
this
report
puts
him
many
critics
saw
that
performance
as
an
audition
aimed
at
an
audience
of
one
the
president
if
so
it
worked
with
trump
announcing
coats
departure
and
ratcliffe's
nomination
days
later
the
most
recent
scuffles
are
part
of
a
larger
war
between
trump
and
the
intelligence
community
that
has
been
raging
just
beneath
the
headlines
since
before
the
president
even
took
office
the
intelligence
community's
january
assessment
that
russia
interfered
in
the
presidential
election
to
swing
votes
toward
trump
cast
a
shadow
over
the
incoming
administration
that
only
grew
longer
as
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
opened
a
counter-intelligence
investigation
into
trump
and
his
campaign
when
then
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
recused
himself
from
overseeing
the
russia
probe
and
deputy
attorney
general
rod
rosenstein
appointed
a
special
counsel
trump
was
reportedly
incensed
the
nation's
intelligence
chiefs
have
also
publicly
contradicted
the
white
house
in
their
assessments
of
iran
and
north
korea
widening
the
chasm
between
trump
and
his
intelligence
services
update
this
story
has
been
updated
to
reflect
that
rep
ratcliffe's
nomination
has
been
withdrawn
