epa-funded
research
finds
pollution
made
worse
by
climate
change
can
accelerate
lung
disease
the
findings
out
tuesday
show
that
air
pollution
can
accelerate
lung
disease
as
much
as
a
pack
of
cigarettes
a
day
air
pollution
especially
one
type
that
is
worsening
with
global
warming
can
accelerate
lung
disease
as
quickly
as
smoking
a
pack
of
cigarettes
a
day
new
research
released
tuesday
shows
the
study
published
on
august
in
the
journal
jama
by
researchers
at
the
university
of
washington
columbia
university
and
the
university
at
buffalo
doubles
down
on
the
link
between
air
pollutants
and
lung
disease
it
also
emphasizes
the
connection
between
the
lung
ailment
emphysema
and
pollution
from
ground-level
ozone
the
main
ingredient
in
smog
not
to
be
confused
with
the
ozone
layer
air
pollutants
have
long
been
associated
with
both
cardiovascular
and
respiratory
diseases
chronic
lower
respiratory
disease
is
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
death
in
the
united
states
and
the
third
leading
cause
worldwide
but
tuesday's
study
funded
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
showed
an
increase
in
emphysema
after
exposure
to
pollutants
like
pm
fine
particulate
matter
already
linked
to
a
staggering
number
of
deaths
as
well
as
black
carbon
most
notable
was
the
impact
of
ozone
while
other
air
pollutants
are
largely
decreasing
nationwide
ozone
is
increasing
with
severe
public
health
ramifications
for
years
scientists
have
linked
worsening
ozone
pollution
to
climate
change
smog
is
created
when
pollutants
react
with
each
other
in
sunlight
warmer
temperatures
can
cause
air
to
stagnate
forcing
people
to
breathe
in
the
pollution
so
as
ozone
becomes
more
prevalent
with
climate
change
its
impact
on
lungs
will
become
more
widespread
the
year
study
tracked
more
than
people
of
various
ethnicities
and
races
between
and
across
six
major
metropolitan
areas
researchers
found
that
if
an
individual's
exposure
to
ozone
pollution
increased
slightly
by
parts
per
billion
that
was
significantly
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
emphysema
over
a
decade
the
equivalent
of
smoking
one
pack
of
cigarettes
every
day
for
years
the
world
health
organization
recommends
people
not
exceed
exposure
to
ozone
levels
of
ppb
over
eight
hours
and
no
more
than
days
in
one
year
the
epa's
recommendations
put
that
level
at
ppb
the
urban
areas
included
in
the
study
are
chicago
illinois
winston-salem
north
carolina
baltimore
maryland
los
angeles
california
st
paul
minnesota
and
new
york
new
york
the
new
study
also
found
that
ozone
is
increasing
in
these
cities
a
trend
scientists
attribute
to
climate
change
annual
ozone
averages
in
the
places
studied
were
between
and
ppb
these
findings
matter
since
ground-level
ozone
levels
are
rising
and
the
amount
of
emphysema
on
ct
scans
predicts
hospitalization
from
and
deaths
due
to
chronic
lung
disease
said
dr
r.
graham
barr
a
columbia
university
professor
and
a
senior
author
of
the
paper
while
the
epa
funded
the
study
the
researchers
findings
are
at
odds
with
the
government's
policies
president
donald
trump's
administration
is
weakening
clean
air
regulations
and
seeking
to
relax
air
quality
rules
imposed
on
coal-fired
power
plants
for
example
in
addition
to
targeting
vehicle
emissions
standards
in
states
like
california
data
shows
that
those
standards
have
helped
improve
air
quality
trump
and
other
top-level
officials
have
also
taken
a
skeptical
stance
on
climate
science
downplaying
and
questioning
the
threat
of
global
warming
the
study
in
jama
highlights
that
both
weakening
air
quality
rules
and
ignoring
climate
change
could
have
real
long-term
health
consequences
in
a
statement
co-author
dr
r.
graham
barr
cautioned
that
worsening
ozone
pollution
could
have
dire
health
implications
as
the
world
warms
as
temperatures
rise
with
climate
change
ground-level
ozone
will
continue
to
increase
unless
steps
are
taken
to
reduce
this
pollutant
barr
said
but
it's
not
clear
what
level
of
the
air
pollutants
if
any
is
safe
for
human
health
