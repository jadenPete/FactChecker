texas
congressman's
retirement
points
to
a
tough
for
house
republicans
it
does
not
look
like
house
republicans
expect
to
regain
the
majority
anytime
soon
rep
bill
flores
became
the
fifth
texas
republican
this
term
to
announce
he
will
not
seek
reelection
as
a
growing
number
of
longtime
gop
incumbents
heading
for
the
exits
in
while
his
solidly
republican
district
is
not
as
likely
to
flip
as
several
other
districts
are
the
decision
could
indicate
a
lack
of
optimism
about
his
party's
chances
of
regaining
a
majority
in
the
next
congress
flores
was
first
elected
in
the
republican
landslide
as
part
of
the
new
majority
he
advocated
for
elimination
of
environmental
regulations
opposed
aid
for
superstorm
sandy
victims
while
supporting
emergency
funding
for
his
own
constituents
and
called
the
affordable
care
act
a
violation
of
our
constitutional
liberties
he
served
a
term
as
chairman
of
the
republican
study
committee
a
group
of
house
conservatives
who
work
to
pull
their
party
to
the
right
up
until
this
year
his
entire
house
career
had
been
spent
in
the
majority
with
less
power
it
is
not
unusual
for
minority
party
members
to
retire
especially
when
they
do
not
expect
to
be
in
the
majority
after
the
next
election
after
much
prayer
over
the
past
few
days
and
following
conversations
with
my
wife
gina
during
that
time
i
have
decided
that
my
current
term
will
be
my
last
flores
said
in
a
statement
wednesday
even
though
my
current
term
will
be
my
final
in
congress
i
will
continue
working
with
a
sense
of
urgency
and
diligence
over
the
next
months
to
continue
fulfilling
my
original
campaign
promises
to
the
good
folks
in
tx-
to
restore
liberty
opportunity
and
security
for
hardworking
texas
families
who
were
left
behind
due
to
the
disastrous
policies
of
the
obama
administration
