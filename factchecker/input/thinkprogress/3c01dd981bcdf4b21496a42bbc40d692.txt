why
is
this
texas
secession
group's
flag
hanging
in
moscow
with
years
of
links
in
russia
the
texas
nationalist
movement
pushes
on
for
years
the
texas
nationalist
movement
has
cultivated
ties
in
russia
especially
among
those
who've
received
financing
directly
from
the
kremlin
now
as
thinkprogress
discovered
one
of
the
texas-based
secessionist
group's
flags
is
actually
hanging
outright
in
moscow
highlighting
the
ongoing
questions
surrounding
their
links
overseas
last
week
alexander
ionov
posted
a
video
to
his
instagram
page
which
remains
one
of
his
preferred
platforms
for
highlighting
his
ties
to
other
groups
ionov
runs
the
anti-globalization
movement
of
russia
a
group
that
helps
organize
secession
movements
across
the
west
and
which
has
received
financing
from
the
kremlin
in
the
past
in
the
video
the
texas
nationalist
movement's
flag
can
be
seen
hanging
prominently
in
the
office
the
caption
of
the
video
read
if
your
office
doesn't
look
like
this
don't
even
call
me
ionov
confirmed
to
thinkprogress
that
the
texas
nationalist
movement
flag
is
hanging
in
his
group's
office
saying
it
had
been
hanging
there
a
long
time
when
asked
why
the
flag
is
hanging
ionov
responded
it's
beautiful
the
flag
joins
other
items
ionov
has
previously
hung
in
his
office
including
a
letter
from
russian
president
vladimir
putin
personally
thanking
ionov
for
his
work
to
strengthen
friendship
between
peoples
ionov
has
also
been
involved
in
raising
money
for
maria
butina
the
convicted
russian
agent
who
successfully
infiltrated
the
national
rifle
association
the
texas
nationalist
movement
did
not
respond
to
thinkprogress's
questions
but
ionov
said
the
flag
was
a
gift
the
flag
highlights
the
years
of
strange
ties
between
the
texas-based
group
and
patrons
in
moscow
the
texas
nationalist
movement
the
leading
pro-secession
group
in
texas
claims
that
its
mission
is
to
secure
and
protect
the
political
cultural
and
economic
independence
of
the
nation
of
texas
and
to
restore
and
protect
a
constitutional
republic
and
the
inherent
rights
of
the
people
of
texas
but
since
at
least
representatives
from
the
texas
nationalist
movement
have
traveled
to
russia
to
stake
their
case
for
those
in
russia
to
back
their
cause
the
texas
nationalist
movement's
nathan
smith
has
led
multiple
trips
to
russia
building
links
with
ionov's
group
along
the
way
smith
for
instance
represented
the
texas
nationalist
movement
at
a
secessionist
conference
in
moscow
in
just
a
few
months
before
the
u.s.
presidential
election
the
website
for
the
far-right
russian
rodina
party
a
party
co-founded
by
sanctioned
russian
official
dmitry
rogozin
even
featured
smith
on
its
website
during
one
of
his
visits
other
american
representatives
including
those
supposedly
backing
california
independence
also
attended
the
conference
texas
nationalist
movement
officials
later
revealed
that
ionov's
organization
had
helped
fund
the
texas
group's
travels
directly
in
a
december
interview
with
kqed
texas
nationalist
movement
head
daniel
miller
declined
to
say
how
much
money
the
kremlin
gave
to
the
texas
nationalist
movement
while
the
texas
nationalist
movement
built
its
links
in
moscow
the
russian
internet
research
agency
ira
spent
specifically
targeting
those
backing
texas
secession
primarily
via
facebook
and
twitter
for
instance
the
ira's
heart
of
texas
facebook
page
grew
wildly
popular
on
the
platform
not
only
was
it
the
largest
facebook
page
dedicated
to
texas
secession
but
it
at
one
point
had
more
followers
in
than
the
official
texas
gop
and
texas
democratic
facebook
pages
combined
the
heart
of
texas
page
claimed
that
it
was
collecting
names
of
supporters
to
pass
along
to
the
texas
nationalist
movement
although
texas
nationalist
movement
members
denied
they
ever
collaborated
with
the
heart
of
texas
page
regardless
ionov
and
his
group
aren't
the
only
kremlin-funded
movement
with
whom
the
texas
nationalist
movement
has
cultivated
links
in
late
according
to
the
telegraph
the
texas
nationalist
movement
confirmed
it
had
met
with
a
representative
from
the
russian-backed
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
and
announced
that
they
had
a
fundamental
right
to
self-determination
the
separatists
have
received
years
of
funding
arms
and
direction
from
the
kremlin
acting
as
an
effective
proxy
for
russian
designs
in
breaking
up
ukraine
they
have
also
been
accused
of
human
rights
atrocities
along
the
way
none
of
which
stopped
the
texas
nationalist
movement
from
meeting
with
one
of
their
representatives
looking
forward
ionov
told
thinkprogress
that
he's
planning
on
trying
to
host
another
secession
conference
in
russia
this
year
whether
the
texas
nationalist
movement
makes
another
appearance
remains
to
be
seen
