only
black
republican
congress
member
just
announced
his
retirement
rep
will
hurd's
departure
is
the
most
recent
indication
that
a
blue
wave
in
texas
could
be
imminent
the
last
remaining
african
american
republican
in
congress
rep
will
hurd
of
texas
announced
he
will
not
run
for
reelection
a
decision
that
could
further
shift
texas
political
landscape
blue
hurd
a
former
cia
officer
was
elected
in
to
represent
one
of
the
most
racially
gerrymandered
districts
in
the
country
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
spanning
over
miles
from
san
antonio
to
el
paso
in
a
statement
thursday
evening
hurd
said
he
wanted
to
enter
the
private
sector
so
he
could
solve
problems
at
the
nexus
between
technology
and
national
security
hurd's
term
does
not
end
until
and
he
said
in
a
statement
that
he
would
like
to
continue
promoting
free
market
economics
and
rail
on
socialism
to
his
district's
latinx
voters
a
community
his
own
political
party
has
feverishly
tried
to
stop
from
casting
a
ballot
at
all
hurd
is
one
of
the
very
few
republicans
who
actually
pushed
back
on
some
of
trump's
most
racist
propositions
such
as
providing
funding
for
trump's
ineffective
vanity
wall
along
the
southern
u.s.
border
in
his
statement
he
touted
his
record
of
support
for
funding
border
patrol
agents
exposing
students
to
computer
science
training
teachers
to
incorporate
coding
into
their
math
classes
and
shaving
costs
on
government
it
purchases
two
centuries
ago
i
would
have
been
counted
as
three-fifths
of
a
person
and
today
i
can
say
i've
had
the
honor
of
serving
three
terms
in
congress
america
has
come
a
long
way
and
we
still
have
more
to
do
in
our
pursuit
of
a
more
perfect
union
hurd
said
i
will
keep
fighting
to
make
certain
we
successfully
meet
these
generational
challenges
head
on
i
will
keep
fighting
to
remind
people
why
i
love
america
that
we
are
neither
republican
nor
democrat
nor
independent
we
are
better
than
the
sum
of
our
parts
but
texas
democrats
see
hurd's
departure
as
further
evidence
that
the
lone
star
state's
political
landscape
is
shifting
blue
or
at
least
a
shade
of
purple
several
other
prominent
texas
republicans
have
also
announced
their
retirement
from
congress
recently
including
rep
mike
conaway
whose
district
is
located
in
west
texas
and
rep
pete
olson
whose
district
is
located
south
of
houston
two
of
the
three
retiring
texas
republicans
were
re-elected
to
office
during
the
midterms
in
november
by
fairly
narrow
margins
an
election
in
which
democrats
picked
up
a
number
of
seats
in
the
texas
legislatures
and
in
the
u.s.
congress
the
democratic
challenger
for
one
of
the
state's
senate
seats
in
beto
o'rourke
who
is
now
running
for
president
came
shockingly
close
to
defeating
republican
incumbent
sen
ted
cruz
during
that
election
as
well
in
november
hurd
defeated
gina
ortiz
jones
a
former
air
force
intelligence
officer
by
less
than
a
point
with
just
votes
separating
the
two
candidates
jones
has
since
announced
she
will
compete
again
for
the
seat
in
olson
meanwhile
only
defeated
democratic
challenger
sri
preston
kulkarni
by
about
points
in
kulkarni
also
announced
he
will
run
again
in
tom
emmer
chair
of
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
called
hurd
a
patriot
in
a
statement
thursday
evening
and
said
the
retiring
congressman
represents
an
r
district
that
they
will
fight
tooth
and
nail
to
ensure
it
remains
in
republican
hands
in
he
said
however
the
state's
democratic
party
executive
director
manny
garcia
called
texas
the
biggest
battleground
state
in
a
statement
thursday
night
republicans
know
it
and
texas
democrats
damn
sure
know
it
he
said
texas
democrats
are
rising
up
everywhere
clearly
will
hurd
knew
his
time
was
up
as
we
have
said
before
we
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
there
were
more
retirements
garcia
added
