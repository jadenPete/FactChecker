arizona
senator
thinks
mass
shootings
really
aren't
the
federal
government's
problem
appointed
sen
martha
mcsally
r-az
said
in
that
all
gun
control
is
unconstitutional
sen
martha
mcsally
r-az
who
was
appointed
to
the
late
john
mccain's
seat
weeks
after
losing
in
the
general
election
for
the
state's
other
senate
seat
last
november
suggested
on
wednesday
that
the
solution
to
curbing
mass
shootings
should
be
found
at
the
state
or
even
local
level
this
comes
after
the
nra-funded
republican
backed
a
federal
law
to
overrule
state's
concealed
weapon
licensing
laws
mcsally
appeared
at
district
events
in
bullhead
city
arizona
where
she
was
reportedly
asked
by
a
constituent
about
what
can
be
done
to
stop
mass
shootings
mcsally
answered
that
solutions
must
come
not
just
from
the
federal
government
but
from
state
and
even
local
lawmakers
i
believe
in
states
rights
she
said
most
problems
can
be
solved
at
the
state
and
local
level
mcsally's
record
on
guns
has
been
to
oppose
virtually
every
new
gun
control
measure
she
has
earned
an
a
rating
from
the
national
rifle
association
and
has
bragged
about
receiving
their
endorsements
she
was
one
of
the
nation's
largest
recipients
of
campaign
contributions
from
gun-rights
organizations
with
more
than
in
gun
money
in
her
house
race
mcsally
said
at
a
primary
debate
that
she
believed
any
limits
to
gun
sales
would
be
unconstitutional
just
like
i
can
sell
my
car
i
can
sell
my
gun
she
claimed
any
restrictions
on
that
at
gun
shows
or
other
places
is
sic
just
absolutely
unconstitutional
while
some
issues
can
be
effectively
addressed
locally
and
by
states
the
issue
of
guns
has
not
proven
to
be
one
of
them
states
can
pass
laws
requiring
universal
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
banning
the
sale
of
assault
weapons
or
restricting
high-capacity
magazines
but
they
have
little
to
no
impact
when
would-be
shooters
can
simply
drive
to
a
neighboring
jurisdiction
with
weaker
laws
and
get
the
same
weapons
there
this
has
been
a
problem
in
states
like
california
where
people
have
driven
to
nevada
for
weapons
and
cities
like
chicago
which
borders
gun-friendly
indiana
additionally
many
pro-gun
legislatures
have
passed
laws
to
systematically
preempt
local
governments
from
acting
at
all
moreover
mcsally
herself
worked
to
undermine
the
states
rights
she
claims
to
support
in
she
voted
for
h.r.
the
concealed
carry
reciprocity
act
the
bill
which
passed
the
house
but
stalled
in
the
senate
would
have
required
that
states
with
meaningful
concealed
weapon
licensing
requirements
allow
people
licensed
in
other
states
with
weaker
concealed
carry
laws
to
carry
concealed
weapons
when
visiting
