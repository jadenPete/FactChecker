the
election
might
be
the
first
to
hinge
on
gun
control
it's
become
a
winning
issue
for
democrats
why
aren't
the
candidates
leaning
into
it
when
is
the
right
time
to
have
a
meaningful
substantive
debate
on
gun
control
the
correct
answer
of
course
is
yesterday
for
republican
lawmakers
the
answer
is
never
for
the
field
of
democrats
running
for
president
the
answer
might
finally
be
now
it's
taken
a
few
years
a
few
decades
perhaps
longer
than
one
would
hope
but
democrats
in
congress
and
on
the
campaign
trail
are
beginning
to
find
their
voice
on
the
issue
of
gun
control
as
recently
as
a
few
years
ago
even
after
mass
shootings
at
virginia
tech
at
sandy
hook
at
fort
hood
in
aurora
colorado
in
charleston
south
carolina
gave
birth
to
groups
like
everytown
moms
demand
action
and
giffords
democratic
lawmakers
in
washington
were
still
treading
lightly
on
the
issue
of
guns
sure
every
mass
shooting
triggered
a
wave
of
indignation
at
our
collective
inability
to
curb
gun
violence
and
renewed
calls
for
legislative
action
but
when
those
bills
inevitably
stalled
at
the
feet
of
republican
obstructionists
democrats
would
allow
their
outrage
to
recede
at
least
until
the
next
mass
shooting
like
the
tides
their
interest
ebbed
and
flowed
in
this
case
the
gravitational
force
at
work
was
the
national
rifle
association
republicans
have
cowered
in
fear
of
the
group's
undue
influence
for
decades
but
more
than
a
few
democrats
did
as
well
and
leaders
within
the
party
were
keenly
aware
that
their
most
vulnerable
members
in
congress
often
hailed
from
districts
where
existing
gun
culture
all
but
forbade
politicians
who
wanted
to
win
an
election
from
running
afoul
of
the
nra
that
is
simply
no
longer
the
case
if
gun
control
was
once
a
third
rail
of
democratic
politics
it's
now
a
litmus
test
there
are
two
broad
and
interconnected
reasons
why
the
first
is
the
aforementioned
rise
of
new
advocacy
organizations
focused
on
the
issue
of
gun
control
many
of
them
have
been
around
for
years
but
their
political
influence
is
only
now
coming
into
maturation
thanks
in
no
small
part
to
the
survivors
of
the
school
shooting
in
parkland
florida
their
refusal
to
be
silenced
and
forgotten
has
kept
the
issue
of
gun
control
in
the
public
consciousness
even
as
the
current
administration
sets
the
rest
of
the
world
on
fire
gun
control
even
as
recently
as
the
election
was
never
a
top
issue
for
voters
in
the
same
way
health
care
the
economy
and
social
safety
net
programs
were
but
since
parkland
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
the
issue
is
firmly
lodging
itself
in
the
minds
of
voters
during
the
midterms
gun
policy
was
ranked
as
a
very
important
issue
by
percent
of
voters
in
a
survey
conducted
by
the
pew
research
center
that
ranked
it
ahead
of
taxes
medicare
social
security
immigration
and
all
but
two
other
issues
so
animating
has
the
issue
of
gun
control
become
among
democrats
in
particular
that
an
entire
presidential
campaign
was
launched
atop
a
platform
of
gun
control
and
while
rep
eric
swalwell's
d-ca
entry
into
the
field
was
short-lived
the
very
notion
of
a
candidate
running
on
the
issue
of
gun
control
was
unthinkable
even
four
years
ago
simultaneously
as
the
influence
of
gun
control
groups
has
grown
the
nra's
has
waned
once
the
standard
bearer
for
single-issue
advocacy
organizations
their
grading
system
for
politicians
once
had
the
ability
to
sink
or
sustain
an
entire
campaign
the
nra
is
now
limping
into
the
election
season
after
a
series
of
highly
publicized
and
deeply
embarrassing
failures
the
first
came
at
the
hands
of
the
parkland
survivors
once
again
their
effort
to
encourage
boycotts
of
corporations
that
partnered
with
the
nra
was
a
resounding
success
and
resulted
in
the
group
losing
dozens
of
corporate
allies
and
the
financial
incentives
that
came
with
them
infighting
within
the
senior
leadership
of
the
organization
leaked
into
the
public
arena
leading
to
resignations
lawsuits
and
more
bad
press
the
organization's
foray
into
original
video
nra
tv
was
unceremoniously
shuttered
and
their
finances
once
their
greatest
source
of
strength
are
reportedly
in
shambles
some
republicans
may
still
regard
the
nra
as
a
formidable
political
force
but
the
american
public
by
and
large
do
not
perhaps
the
most
valuable
political
asset
for
mainstream
democrats
running
for
office
in
is
how
triggering
their
candidacy
is
to
the
nra
in
the
clearest
sign
yet
of
the
group's
devaluation
on
thursday
both
the
white
house
and
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
the
same
mitch
mcconnell
who
has
staked
his
entire
reputation
on
being
a
roadblock
to
any
meaningful
legislation
proposed
by
democrats
signaled
a
willingness
to
consider
bills
strengthening
and
expanding
background
checks
on
guns
as
legislative
responses
to
mass
shooting
events
go
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
but
the
nra
has
staunchly
opposed
any
effort
to
buttress
existing
background
check
measures
and
if
they
can't
even
keep
moscow
mitch
in
line
one
has
to
wonder
what
actual
power
the
nra
has
left
the
shifting
political
headwinds
make
it
all
the
more
curious
then
that
guns
are
only
now
commanding
the
attention
of
the
democratic
field
several
candidates
have
released
plans
or
proposals
about
how
to
address
gun
violence
in
the
united
states
but
through
four
nights
and
nearly
ten
hours
of
debates
so
far
the
issue
has
barely
been
raised
