steve
bannon
tries
to
use
el
paso
shooting
to
brag
about
trump's
economy
the
architect
of
trump's
campaign
thinks
the
mass
shooting
is
a
sign
that
the
president's
economy
is
great
days
after
president
donald
trump
tweeted
out
his
love
for
his
former
top
adviser
steve
bannon
the
man
he
called
one
of
his
best
pupils
praised
trump
and
said
the
deadly
el
paso
shooting
was
in
fact
proof
of
how
great
a
job
the
president
is
doing
bannon
was
interviewed
on
monday
on
the
the
howie
carr
show
another
former
trump
adviser
corey
lewandowski
was
filling
in
for
carr
as
guest
host
of
the
syndicated
radio
program
asked
about
trump's
re-election
prospects
and
whether
democrats
would
be
able
to
take
back
several
key
states
bannon
claimed
the
field
of
candidates
attacking
the
president
for
being
racist
were
in
fact
attacking
trump's
economic
success
and
would
ultimately
fail
bannon
then
launched
into
a
stunning
rant
about
how
trump
was
the
reason
there
were
so
many
people
at
the
walmart
when
an
alleged
white
supremacist
gunman
carried
out
a
mass
attack
on
saturday
let's
talk
about
this
horrible
situation
in
el
paso
the
other
day
bannon
began
you
know
it
was
at
a
walmart
at
in
the
morning
that's
part
of
the
trump
economic
miracle
what
you
had
is
el
paso
which
i
think
is
hispanic
americans
you
had
citizens
over
there
from
mexico
he
continued
they're
in
the
walmart
because
the
economy's
booming
we
have
the
lowest
hispanic
unemployment
in
this
country
in
what
years
right
and
you
have
another
one
of
these
monsters
right
another
one
of
these
monsters
that
go
in
there
bannon
who
once
boasted
that
he
ran
the
platform
for
the
alt-right
the
conservative
site
breitbart
then
claimed
again
this
was
proof
that
critics
of
trump
were
really
just
attacking
the
trump
miracle
what
the
democratic
candidates
are
attacking
is
the
trump
miracle
he
said
you
see
the
job
reports
the
other
day
that
wages
are
starting
to
rise
again
so
this
is
the
trump
economic
miracle
and
i
don't
see
any
of
these
candidates
addressing
that
trump's
former
campaign
manager
lewandowski
who
said
this
week
that
he
is
seriously
considering
seeking
the
republican
nomination
next
year
to
challenge
sen
jeanne
shaheen
d-nh
did
not
push
back
against
the
argument
a
spokesperson
for
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
which
posted
the
interview
on
youtube
this
week
blasted
both
former
trump
aides
the
fact
that
corey
lewandowski
and
steve
bannon
are
connecting
the
tragedy
in
el
paso
to
their
own
campaign
talking
points
on
the
trump
economy
is
sickening
the
spokesperson
said
in
an
emailed
statement
lewandowski
and
bannon
have
come
up
with
a
response
to
this
shooting
that
is
even
worse
than
the
congressional
republicans
who
are
refusing
to
act
on
common
sense
gun
safety
legislation
lewandowski
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
thinkprogress
inquiry
about
the
interview
repeated
attempts
to
reach
bannon
were
unsuccessful
