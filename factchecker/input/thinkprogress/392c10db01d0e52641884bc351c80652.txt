two
mass
shootings
with
the
same
red
flags
in
common
as
per
usual
a
pair
of
violent
incidents
are
preceded
by
rhetoric
that's
become
all
too
familiar
in
the
wee
hours
of
sunday
a
year-old
white
man
opened
fire
at
dayton
ohio's
oregon
district
a
popular
nightlife
destination
according
to
reports
he
killed
nine
people
including
his
brother
while
injuring
others
this
occurred
mere
hours
after
a
year-old
white
man
entered
a
crowded
el
paso
walmart
with
a
rifle
and
an
intent
to
kill
as
many
hispanic
immigrants
as
possible
there
are
details
that
have
yet
emerge
about
both
shooters
though
the
similarities
in
each
incident
are
nevertheless
unavoidable
key
among
them
is
the
fact
that
both
suspects
have
a
documented
history
of
violent
rhetoric
towards
marginalized
groups
the
two
shootings
that
dominated
the
news
over
the
weekend
are
the
rd
and
th
mass
shootings
in
according
to
the
definition
established
by
the
gun
violence
archive
which
holds
that
a
mass
shooting
is
any
incident
in
which
at
least
four
people
were
shot
since
trump
took
office
in
there
have
been
roughly
mass
shootings
police
have
identified
the
dayton
ohio
shooter
as
connor
betts
a
year-old
white
man
described
by
those
who
knew
him
as
a
troubled
student
with
homicidal
tendencies
and
while
a
concrete
motive
has
not
yet
emerged
few
that
knew
the
boy
are
surprised
the
descriptions
of
former
schoolmates
are
a
familiar
refrain
troubled
student
homicidal
threats
violence
against
women
misogyny
and
a
young
man
that
left
many
uneasy
the
shooter
also
displayed
hateful
and
violent
rhetoric
against
women
misogyny
is
often
part
of
the
mass
shooter
profile
this
isn't
a
mystery
to
me
i'm
furious
one
former
classmate
told
the
dayton
daily
news
anonymously
the
former
classmate
who
is
a
woman
went
on
to
talk
about
a
fantasy
the
shooter
described
to
her
in
vivid
and
gruesome
detail
about
wanting
to
kill
her
she
told
the
paper
that
she
and
her
parents
reported
the
incident
to
the
police
he
was
later
suspended
from
bellbrook
high
school
for
writing
a
so-called
hit
list
on
a
bathroom
stall
wall
this
woman
was
among
those
named
according
to
other
reports
he
may
have
made
two
violent
hit
lists
one
that
listed
girl
classmates
he
wanted
to
sexually
assault
and
another
that
listed
boy
class
mates
he
wanted
to
kill
chris
baker
bellbrook's
former
principal
who
resigned
last
year
confirmed
that
the
shooter
had
been
suspended
for
at
least
the
list
about
killing
girl
classmates
the
extent
of
any
police
record
he
may
have
had
has
not
yet
been
determined
all
that's
understood
about
the
year-old
gunmen
who
opened
fire
in
the
crowded
el
paso
walmart
on
saturday
morning
is
that
he
is
a
dallas
texas
resident
who
lived
with
his
grandparents
a
manifesto
penned
by
the
shooter
which
authorities
believe
he
uploaded
to
the
website
chan
moments
before
the
shooting
took
place
is
filled
with
similarly
hateful
speech
and
violent
threats
in
this
case
against
mexican
immigrants
on
monday
president
donald
trump
called
out
such
racism
saying
in
one
voice
our
nation
must
condemn
racism
bigotry
and
white
supremacy
however
the
president
continued
his
remarks
by
blaming
violent
video
games
mental
illness
and
the
internet
as
similar
fuel
for
such
killers
he
denounced
hate
speech
without
calling
out
his
own
contributions
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
candidacy
for
president
trump
characterized
mexican
immigrants
as
rapists
thieves
and
bad
hombres
meanwhile
he's
been
forgiving
of
white
nationalists
who
participate
in
violent
action
after
a
man
drove
into
a
crowd
of
counter-protestors
at
a
unite
the
right
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
in
trump
infamously
said
their
were
very
fine
people
on
both
sides
the
president
during
his
remarks
on
monday
bemoaned
the
internet's
unsavory
power
using
words
like
sinister
and
contagion
it
was
something
of
an
ironic
choice
given
his
own
propensity
for
referring
to
black
communities
across
the
country
as
suffering
from
an
infestation
just
last
week
trump
attacked
the
entire
city
of
baltimore
and
rep
elijah
cummings
d-md
in
a
series
of
tweets
calling
the
city
dangerous
and
rat
filled
and
claiming
cummings
doesn't
spend
enough
time
in
his
city
as
members
of
his
staff
have
experienced
high
turnover
trump
has
not
held
back
in
letting
the
public
know
how
he
feels
effectively
bullying
former
staffers
online
in
public
call
outs
the
president
told
three
freshman
congresswoman
of
color
to
go
back
to
where
they
came
from
and
in
the
president
called
a
series
of
african
and
caribbean
nations
shit
hole
countries
the
examples
of
trump's
own
use
of
intimidating
hateful
divisive
and
violent
rhetoric
abound
moreover
different
women
have
accused
the
president
of
sexual
assault
recordings
have
surfaced
documenting
his
misogynistic
behavior
and
he's
worked
to
undermine
the
free
press
promulgating
the
concept
of
fake
news
something
else
that
the
el
paso
shooter
glommed
onto
in
his
manifesto
in
his
response
to
the
shootings
trump
made
a
brief
call
for
universal
background
checks
at
the
point
of
purchase
in
gun
sales
during
his
remarks
but
on
twitter
he
tied
the
idea
of
advancing
gun
safety
policies
to
a
renewed
effort
to
promote
his
divisive
and
unpopular
immigration
policy
meanwhile
universal
background
checks
would
only
prevent
those
with
criminal
records
or
otherwise
documented
disqualifying
factors
on
their
public
history
from
obtaining
a
weapon
a
broader
gun
policy
initiative
that
included
what
is
known
as
a
red
flag
law
which
would
allow
law
enforcement
authorities
to
remove
deadly
firearms
from
anyone
credibly
deemed
to
be
a
danger
to
themselves
or
others
would
be
a
much
stronger
solution
along
with
universal
bans
on
assault
rifles
trump
tweeted
we
must
have
something
good
if
not
great
come
out
of
these
two
tragic
events
greatness
chief
among
things
he's
promised
since
his
political
career
began
seems
ever
elusive
correction
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
stated
based
on
preliminary
police
reports
that
the
alleged
dayton
shooter
killed
his
sister
in
the
attack
it
has
been
corrected
to
properly
identify
the
shooter's
sibling
as
his
brother
whom
friends
said
was
a
trans
man
not
out
to
his
family
or
co-workers
