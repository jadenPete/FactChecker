trump
melts
down
after
fed
chair
critiques
his
trade
policy
trump
says
the
fed
chair
he
appointed
is
as
big
a
threat
as
china
in
november
president
donald
trump
who
campaigned
on
a
promise
to
appoint
only
the
best
and
most
serious
people
appointed
jerome
powell
to
be
chair
of
the
federal
reserve's
board
of
governors
on
friday
he
accused
powell
of
being
possibly
a
bigger
enemy
of
the
american
people
than
even
the
general
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
china
in
late
october
he
released
a
hype
video
promising
to
appoint
a
fed
chair
who
he
said
hopefully
will
do
a
fantastic
job
i
have
somebody
very
specific
in
mind
i
think
everybody
will
be
very
impressed
but
most
importantly
i
think
at
the
end
of
eight
years
you
really
will
be
impressed
because
things
are
looking
good
trump
promised
days
later
he
introduced
powell
in
a
rose
garden
announcement
ceremony
and
formally
nominated
him
for
the
job
mr
powell
has
demonstrated
steady
leadership
sound
judgment
and
policy
expertise
his
released
statement
bragged
mr
powell
will
bring
to
the
federal
reserve
a
unique
background
of
government
service
and
business
experience
but
now
that
trump's
trade
war
with
china
and
his
not-very-stimulative
trump
tax
cuts
for
the
rich
and
corporations
have
brought
the
nation
to
the
precipice
of
a
trump
recession
trump
is
seeking
to
convince
americans
that
the
buck
stops
everywhere
but
his
own
desk
powell
said
friday
that
the
president's
trade
war
was
harming
the
nation's
economy
and
that
there
were
limits
to
how
much
he
could
mitigate
that
with
monetary
policy
trade
policy
uncertainty
seems
to
be
playing
a
role
in
the
global
slowdown
and
in
weak
manufacturing
and
capital
spending
in
the
united
states
he
said
in
a
speech
in
jackson
hole
wyoming
w
hile
monetary
policy
is
a
powerful
tool
that
works
to
support
consumer
spending
business
investment
and
public
confidence
it
cannot
provide
a
settled
rulebook
for
international
trade
without
acknowledging
that
he
himself
selected
powell
for
the
job
trump
smeared
him
on
twitter
as
an
enemy
of
the
american
people
his
standard
playbook
for
anyone
who
does
not
give
him
his
way
my
only
question
is
he
tweeted
who
is
our
bigger
enemy
jay
powell
or
chairman
xi
xi
jinping
is
the
general
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
china
and
the
country's
president
in
trump's
initial
attempt
to
insult
powell
he
misspelled
his
own
fed
chair's
name
as
powel
he
later
deleted
that
tweet
and
corrected
it
