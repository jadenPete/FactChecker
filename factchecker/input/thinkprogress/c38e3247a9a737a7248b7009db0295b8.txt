cloudflare
terminates
hosting
services
for
chan
in
wake
of
el
paso
attack
the
site
will
likely
stay
online
but
it
sets
an
ominous
precedent
for
its
future
in
the
past
six
months
three
different
far-right
extremists
have
used
the
website
chan
to
advertise
their
deadly
attacks
the
most
recent
example
occurred
on
saturday
when
a
suspected
gunman
who
allegedly
said
he
was
fighting
the
hispanic
invasion
of
texas
in
a
manifesto
posted
to
the
site
killed
people
at
a
mall
in
el
paso
now
chan's
support
system
may
have
finally
had
enough
in
a
statement
on
sunday
night
cloudflare
a
network
operator
which
helps
protect
websites
against
hacks
and
security
threats
made
the
unusual
announcement
of
saying
that
it
would
no
longer
be
hosting
chan
they
have
proven
themselves
to
be
lawless
and
that
lawlessness
has
caused
multiple
tragic
deaths
company
co-founder
and
ceo
matthew
prince
said
in
a
statement
even
if
chan
may
not
have
violated
the
letter
of
the
law
in
refusing
to
moderate
their
hate-filled
community
they
have
created
an
environment
that
revels
in
violating
its
spirit
to
be
clear
cloudflare
kicking
chan
off
its
services
does
not
mean
that
the
site
is
no
longer
accessible
as
of
monday
morning
est
the
site
is
still
up
while
chan
tweeted
sunday
that
the
site
can
expect
some
downtime
in
the
next
to
hours
while
we
find
a
solution
it
is
more
than
likely
that
chan
will
simply
shift
to
one
of
cloudflare's
competitors
this
was
a
point
that
prince
made
in
his
statement
we
have
seen
this
situation
before
and
so
we
have
a
good
sense
of
what
will
play
out
almost
exactly
two
years
ago
we
made
the
determination
to
kick
another
disgusting
site
off
cloudflare's
network
the
daily
stormer
prince
said
that
caused
a
brief
interruption
in
the
site's
operations
but
they
quickly
came
back
online
using
a
cloudflare
competitor
the
daily
stormer
are
no
longer
cloudflare's
problem
but
they
remain
the
internet's
problem
according
to
the
new
york
times
as
of
monday
morning
chan
is
now
using
bitmitigate
a
service
similar
to
cloudflare
which
is
also
owned
by
the
same
web
host
which
took
on
the
website
gab
after
it
was
tied
to
the
tree
of
life
shooting
in
pittsburgh
last
year
prince
is
right
in
saying
that
there
will
always
be
those
willing
to
provide
website
services
to
even
the
most
vile
and
disgusting
sites
but
that's
not
to
say
that
kicking
a
website
out
of
the
more
mainstream
internet
architecture
doesn't
have
an
effect
while
it
is
true
for
instance
that
the
daily
stormer
remains
accessible
online
it
has
not
exactly
had
it
easy
the
last
two
years
the
site
has
repeatedly
bounced
from
domain
to
domain
in
search
of
a
home
gab
may
still
have
a
user-base
but
it
is
relatively
small
and
the
site
is
frequently
beset
by
technical
glitches
throughout
this
process
one
voice
which
has
become
a
consistent
advocate
for
shutting
down
chan
completely
has
been
its
creator
fredrick
brennan
who
passed
over
control
to
current
owner
jim
watkins
in
finally
this
nightmare
might
have
an
end
he
tweeted
on
sunday
after
the
cloudflare
news
broke
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
making
my
fonts
in
peace
and
not
have
to
worry
about
getting
phone
calls
from
cnn
new
york
times
every
time
a
mass
shooting
happens
they
could
have
prevented
this
and
chose
not
to
watkins
who
runs
chan
with
his
son
in
the
philippines
which
has
less
stringent
digital
laws
than
the
united
states
is
unlikely
to
share
brennan's
concern
and
repeatedly
has
said
that
he
is
unbothered
by
white
supremacists
using
his
website
more
than
anything
the
cloudflare
news
is
yet
another
example
of
how
tech
companies
laissez-faire
approach
to
moderation
and
regulation
on
their
platforms
has
backed
them
into
a
corner
where
they're
forced
to
take
action
they
would
have
previously
found
uncomfortable
a
point
which
prince
emphasized
in
his
statement
we
continue
to
feel
incredibly
uncomfortable
about
playing
the
role
of
content
arbiter
and
do
not
plan
to
exercise
it
often
he
said
our
concern
has
centered
around
another
much
more
universal
idea
the
rule
of
law
