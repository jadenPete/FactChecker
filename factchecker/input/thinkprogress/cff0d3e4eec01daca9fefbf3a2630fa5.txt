announced
monday
that
its
grantees
have
no
choice
but
to
leave

barring

referrals
to
take
effect
during
a
telephone
press
conference
planned

alexis
mcgill
johnson
said
today
we
are
announcing
that
due
to
an
unethical
and
dangerous

the

fundamentally
wrong
and
said
it
was
doing
extraordinary
harm
to
low-income
patients
particularly
women

on
friday
the

refused
to
reverse
a
decision
it
made
last
month
allowing
the
new
trump
administration
policy
to
take
effect
in
february
the
administration
announced
it
would
impose
a
domestic
gag
rule
for
health
care
providers
that
essentially
aims
to
defund
planned
parenthood
and
restrict
low-income

access

family

and
the

in

and
lower

blocked
some
of
its

the

against

on

the

an
estimated
million
low-income
uninsured

underserved
people
each
year
providers
have
to
demonstrate
a
capacity
to
meet
needs
in
the
community
before
receiving
funds
not
only
does
the
new
policy
not
allow
abortion
referrals
but
it
does
not
allow
agencies
that
receive
title
x
funds
to
provide
abortion
even
though
they
are
using
nonfederal
funds
to
do
so
regardless
of
pregnant
patients
wishes
the
rule
would
mandate
that
physicians
refer
those
patients
for
social
services
and
prenatal
services
when
asked
about
the
effect
on
planned
parenthood's
budget
mcgill
johnson
would
not
provide
specific
numbers
but
did
describe
the
effect
on
low-income
people
who
benefit
from
the
services
planned
parenthood
provides
the
impact
that
will
happen
to
our
patients
is
that
they
will
be
delayed
they
will
in
some
cases
forgo
care
because
they
can't
afford
to
take
extra
time
off
to
get
care
and
it
means
that
certain
affiliates
like
an
affiliate
in
ohio
won't
be
able
to
use
their
mobile
health
unit
to
go
out
in
communities
and
do
sti
screening
she
said
the
rule
would
go
against
informed
consent
and
shared
decision-making
in
medical
ethics
as
the
american
medical
association
defines
it
the
ama
says
physicians
should
tell
patients
about
the
burdens
risks
and
expected
benefits
of
all
options
including
forgoing
treatment
last
year
the
american
nurses
association
ana
said
regarding
the
proposed
policy
as
the
most
honest
and
ethical
profession
nurses
must
guard
against
any
erosive
policy
that
hinders
patients
from
making
meaningful
informed
decisions
about
their
own
health
or
that
blocks
access
to
care
the
rule
also
requires
the
financial
and
physical
separation
of
title
x
projects
and
facilities
from
programs
and
facilities
where
abortion
is
a
method
of
family
planning
the
impact
on
low-income
people
who
need
reproductive
health
services
could
be
dramatic
a
study
from
the
national
campaign
to
prevent
teen
and
unplanned
pregnancy
found
that
in
counties
across
the
country
planned
parenthood
is
the
only
clinic
offering
comprehensive
contraceptive
services
planned
parenthood
health
centers
serve
of
women
who
receive
contraceptive
care
from
a
family
planning
center
according
to
a
guttmacher
report
planned
parenthood
represented
of
clinics
and
of
contraceptive
clients
among
title
x-funded
family
planning
clinics
the
report
did
not
address
transgender
men
and
nonbinary
people
who
may
be
clients
who
receive
contraceptive
care
at
family
planning
centers
kinsey
hasstedt
a
public
policy
associate
in
the
guttmacher
institute
wrote
for
health
affairs
that
the
rule
would
reduce
people's
access
to
a
full
range
of
options
she
said
the
trump
administration
policy
favors
primary
care-focused
health
care
providers
over
reproductive
health
care
providers
and
allows
more
ideological
control
of
health
care
according
to
politico
a
few
states
have
already
responded
to
the
policy
in
july
illinois
said
it
would
not
use
title
x
funding
while
the
policy
remains
in
effect
that
same
month
washington
state
informed
hhs
it
could
no
longer
act
in
accordance
with
the
rule
and
would
no
longer
take
title
x
funds
oregon
health
authority
spokesperson
jonathan
modie
told
politico
last
week
that
the
state
is
using
its
general
fund
to
keep
the
clinics
going
in
order
to
forgo
title
x
funds
hawaii
has
also
said
it
wouldn't
comply
with
the
rule
hhs
released
a
statement
that
focused
on
planned
parenthood
in
particular
to
the
extent
that
planned
parenthood
claims
that
it
must
make
burdensome
changes
to
comply
with
the
final
rule
it
is
actually
choosing
to
place
a
higher
priority
on
the
ability
to
refer
for
abortion
instead
of
continuing
to
receive
federal
funds
to
provide
a
broad
range
of
acceptable
and
effective
family
planning
methods
and
services
to
clients
in
need
of
these
services

department
