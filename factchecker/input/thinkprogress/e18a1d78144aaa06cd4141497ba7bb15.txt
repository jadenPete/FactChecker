trump
has
already
given
up
on
banning
assault
weapons
trump
falsely
claims
there's
no
appetite
for
an
assault
weapons
ban
before
departing
for
dayton
and
el
paso
in
the
wake
of
mass
shootings
in
those
cities
president
donald
trump
tried
to
downplay
expectations
for
any
legislation
that
would
actually
help
prevent
future
gun
violence
trump
did
express
support
for
expanding
background
checks
for
gun
buyers
which
as
thinkprogress
reported
earlier
this
week
is
a
massive
flip-flop
from
promises
he
previously
made
to
gun
lobbyists
but
when
asked
about
an
assault
weapons
ban
trump
claimed
that
there
is
no
political
appetite
for
that
at
this
moment
you
could
do
your
own
polling
and
there
is
no
political
appetite
probably
from
the
standpoint
of
legislature
sic
but
i
will
certainly
bring
that
up
he
said
i'll
bring
that
up
as
one
of
the
points
contrary
to
trump's
claim
new
polling
is
not
required
to
prove
that
he
is
generally
wrong
as
fivethirtyeight
points
out
support
for
gun
control
measures
can
ebb
and
flow
but
it
is
always
far
stronger
in
the
wake
of
mass
shootings
and
has
never
sunk
back
to
its
levels
from
before
the
shooting
at
sandy
hook
elementary
school
moreover
support
for
assault
weapon
bans
has
remained
consistently
high
according
to
quinnipiac
for
example
support
for
such
a
ban
hasn't
fallen
below
over
the
last
three
years
gallup's
polling
has
asked
a
question
that
included
a
ban
on
the
manufacturing
of
assault
weapons
and
found
slightly
weaker
support
but
when
in
it
asked
about
reinstating
the
assault
weapons
ban
from
the
s
it
received
a
strong
majority
of
support
what
is
most
dispiriting
about
trump's
answer
is
the
implication
that
he's
already
given
up
on
the
idea
of
pushing
for
an
assault
weapons
ban
he
said
he
might
bring
that
up
but
he
certainly
didn't
indicate
any
belief
that
such
a
ban
would
be
useful
even
though
almost
every
mass
shooting
uses
the
same
semi-automatic
weapons
even
the
trump-friendly
new
york
post
urged
trump
this
week
to
support
an
assault
weapons
ban
it
should
not
have
to
be
this
way
