the
dea
just
made
a
huge
change
to
how
the
government
treats
medical
marijuana
a
bland
announcement
in
the
federal
register
on
monday
may
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
federal
drug
cops
year
reefer
madness
crusade
the
federal
government
announced
plans
to
expand
cannabis
research
monday
paving
the
way
for
the
robust
clinical
trials
cannabis
experts
believe
will
force
the
government
to
downgrade
marijuana's
controlled
substances
act
classification
the
decision
comes
just
two
days
before
a
key
deadline
in
a
lawsuit
against
the
agency
brought
by
cannabis
researcher
dr
sue
sisley
of
the
scottsdale
research
institute
sisley
had
sought
to
end
three
years
of
stalling
by
the
drug
enforcement
agency
dea
monday's
regulatory
filing
and
the
warm
remarks
from
attorney
general
william
barr
that
accompanied
it
in
a
press
release
effectively
mean
dr
sisley's
won
coupled
with
barr's
ardently
anti-pot
predecessor
jeff
sessions
departure
progress
toward
looser
federal
treatment
of
cannabis
may
resume
until
today
no
one
could
do
anything
we
were
handcuffed
in
limbo
said
shane
pennington
a
member
of
dr
sisley's
legal
team
now
they've
done
something
it's
a
huge
huge
deal
the
actual
notice
published
in
the
federal
register
is
characteristically
dry
but
it
says
the
dea
will
soon
unveil
a
proposed
regulation
to
govern
applications
to
grow
cannabis
for
scientific
and
medical
research
for
half
a
century
only
one
grow
was
legally
approved
for
such
purposes
a
university
of
mississippi
facility
contracted
by
the
national
institute
on
drug
abuse
nida
that
monopoly
on
production
has
hampered
researchers
like
dr
sisley
for
years
the
u-miss
project
only
produced
a
handful
of
strains
of
cannabis
and
their
cultivation
methods
produced
low-grade
flower
dr
sisley's
research
which
probes
cannabis's
potential
to
treat
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
and
focuses
on
combat
veterans
required
product
of
higher
quality
more
consistent
quality
and
a
wider
variety
of
chemical
makeups
the
subtleties
of
cannabis
chemistry
go
far
beyond
the
thc
that
produces
a
recreational
high
and
some
researchers
believe
other
attributes
of
the
plant
might
have
various
psychological
and
physiological
benefits
a
monopoly
on
production
for
research
meant
nida
and
the
growers
in
mississippi
had
no
incentive
to
deliver
what
dr
sisley
and
her
peers
wanted
for
their
studies
back
in
the
dea
claimed
to
be
ready
to
smash
up
nida's
single-actor
control
of
research
cannabis
back
that
announcement
was
greeted
with
great
fanfare
in
the
research
and
drug
policy
communities
and
prompted
dr
sisley
to
apply
for
a
research-grow
license
from
the
dea
later
that
year
but
it
was
only
a
departmental
policy
there
was
no
follow-through
nobody
at
the
government
would
respond
to
her
application
or
the
dozens
of
others
filed
since
and
because
there
were
no
federal
regulations
related
to
the
policy
memorandum
dr
sisley's
attorney
explained
it
was
almost
impossible
to
force
the
agency
to
do
what
it
had
promised
they
asked
for
these
applications
they
acknowledged
the
importance
of
this
research
and
then
they
did
nothing
for
years
shane
pennington
said
in
an
interview
but
the
rulemaking
process
announced
monday
opens
the
floor
to
public
comments
which
in
turn
obligates
the
dea
to
respond
in
writing
that
writing
will
generate
specific
points
of
contention
that
courts
can
review
the
final
regulations
will
obligate
the
dea
to
process
applications
in
some
specific
fashion
that
will
allow
would-be
research
grows
to
appeal
rejections
to
a
federal
judge
if
they
believe
they've
been
arbitrarily
kept
out
of
the
market
despite
the
good
news
sisley
cautioned
monday
that
the
new
regs
leave
the
dea
plenty
of
room
for
further
shennanigans
now
we
just
need
to
keep
the
dea's
feet
to
the
fire
sisley
said
in
a
statement
dea
doj
can
slow-roll
this
for
many
years
to
come
leaving
progress
of
medical
cannabis
research
in
limbo
indefinitely
but
at
least
that
door
is
now
theoretically
kicked
open
the
agency
could
have
taken
this
step
with
no
fanfare
had
it
wished
but
it
got
a
full
press
rollout
from
the
department
of
justice
i
am
pleased
that
dea
is
moving
forward
with
its
review
of
applications
for
those
who
seek
to
grow
marijuana
legally
to
support
research
attorney
general
barr
said
in
a
statement
on
the
agency's
move
the
good
news
for
researchers
and
those
who
suffer
from
the
illnesses
and
difficulties
they
hope
to
cure
with
cannabis
products
is
only
the
beginning
monday's
announcement
is
likely
to
provide
a
major
boost
to
the
push
for
federal
decriminalization
or
even
legalization
there's
a
ping-pong
logic
at
play
here
pennington
explained
the
dea
has
insisted
that
cannabis
remain
a
schedule
i
narcotic
the
tightest
category
of
criminal
enforcement
and
pharmaceutical
regulation
under
federal
drug
law
even
as
half
the
states
in
the
nation
have
legalized
it
for
either
medical
or
recreational
use
if
clinicians
like
dr
sisley
succeed
in
identifying
specific
medical
uses
of
cannabis
or
its
extracts
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
certifies
those
findings
that
would
force
the
dea
to
reschedule
cannabis
nationwide
the
only
thing
keeping
it
schedule
i
at
this
point
is
that
according
to
the
dea
there
is
no
acceptable
medical
use
in
the
united
states
for
marijuana
pennington
said
now
how
do
you
get
that
through
clinical
trials
that
show
it's
safe
and
effective
and
who's
the
gatekeeper
there
the
dea
and
the
fda
the
dea
filing
notes
the
agency
anticipates
that
additional
strains
of
marihuana
sic
will
be
produced
and
made
available
to
researchers
under
the
forthcoming
regs
and
anticipates
the
changes
will
potentially
aid
in
the
development
of
safe
and
effective
drug
products
that
may
be
approved
for
marketing
by
the
fda
that's
a
recipe
for
moving
cannabis
down
to
schedule
ii
and
a
vindication
of
the
confidence
cannabis
industry
insiders
have
shown
in
recent
years
the
sheer
amount
of
money
being
made
thanks
to
state
experiments
with
legalization
has
led
many
investors
and
entrepreneurs
to
view
federal
legalization
as
a
matter
of
when
not
if
it's
important
not
to
overstate
the
significance
of
potential
cannabis
rescheduling
state
legalization
has
succeeded
because
two
presidents
in
a
row
have
decided
to
allow
it
to
continue
if
cannabis
drops
to
schedule
ii
nothing
would
change
legally
about
the
current
order
of
battle
on
legalization
and
retail
sales
but
as
a
practical
and
political
matter
rescheduling
would
be
a
major
signal
that
the
feds
are
closer
than
ever
to
giving
up
on
the
drug
war's
most
destructive
lie
ending
federal
prohibition
isn't
the
magic
bullet
for
ending
mass
incarceration
that
some
advocates
have
portrayed
it
as
over
the
years
but
it
would
fundamentally
reset
the
relationship
between
police
and
drug
users
and
the
communities
where
they
currently
interact
as
hostiles
would
stand
to
gain
from
the
change
much
like
the
nida
monopoly
on
research
growing
has
effectively
locked
in
nixon-era
reefer
madness
ideas
at
the
federal
level
by
making
proper
medical
research
impossible
the
dea's
insistence
that
pot
is
so
dangerous
it
must
be
classified
alongside
schedule
i
drugs
like
heroin
has
warped
funding
streams
enforcement
priorities
civil
forfeiture
regimes
and
other
law
enforcement
practices
with
far-reaching
effects
on
communities
now
the
dea's
formal
announcement
it
plans
to
respond
to
research
grow
applications
sets
the
stage
for
all
that
to
change
they
may
deny
many
of
the
applications
but
if
they
register
even
some
it'll
be
the
end
of
the
year
nida
monopoly
pennington
said
that's
giant
this
piece
has
been
updated
to
include
comment
from
dr
sisley
and
to
correct
a
reference
to
the
dea's
scheduling
of
other
narcotics
