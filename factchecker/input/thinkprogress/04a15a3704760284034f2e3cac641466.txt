the
parkland
students
propose
comprehensive
gun
policy
students
who
survived
a
massacre
at
their
parkland
florida
high
school
last
year
unveiled
an
ambitious
gun
policy
in
the
wake
of
the
twin
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
that
claimed
lives
one
recent
weekend
the
peace
plan
for
a
safer
america
which
students
and
graduates
of
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
announced
wednesday
is
meant
to
be
a
blueprint
for
the
winner
of
the
election
whether
it
is
president
donald
trump
or
a
democrat
more
to
the
point
the
document
aims
to
inspire
the
nation's
youngest
citizens
including
those
who
are
just
to
vote
it's
bold
it's
nothing
like
anyone
else
is
proposing
we
are
really
setting
audacious
goals
and
more
than
anything
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
is
be
intersectional
said
tyah-amoy
roberts
a
parkland
survivor
and
board
member
of
march
for
our
lives
the
movement
started
by
the
students
after
a
shooter
killed
people
in
their
high
school
we
know
and
acknowledge
every
day
that
gun
violence
prevention
is
not
just
about
preventing
mass
shootings
she
said
the
peace
plan
is
an
anti-gun
violence
advocate's
dream
the
platform
contains
six
initiatives
that
are
fairly
straightforward
a
green
new
deal
but
for
guns
jaclyn
corin
a
graduate
of
the
high
school
tweeted
wednesday
morning
like
the
green
new
deal
a
climate-change
proposal
the
parkland
students
peace
plan
aims
to
be
holistic
the
plan
calls
for
some
gun-policy
mainstays
like
instituting
universal
background
checks
raising
the
age
to
purchase
guns
to
banning
assault
rifles
and
implementing
red
flag
laws
that
would
allow
law
enforcement
to
take
away
firearms
from
people
deemed
to
be
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
but
it
also
backs
a
national
licensing
and
registry
system
not
unlike
the
one
used
for
automobiles
it
also
focuses
on
interventions
at
the
community
level
suicide
prevention
mental
health
domestic
violence
and
police
brutality
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
dayton
and
el
paso
shootings
this
month
it
seemed
as
though
momentum
around
finding
solutions
to
reduce
gun
violence
had
picked
up
considerably
trump
even
flirted
with
the
idea
of
universal
background
checks
something
over
half
of
americans
say
they
want
but
it
took
just
one
phone
call
from
national
rifle
association
leader
wayne
lapierre
on
tuesday
for
trump
to
back
away
from
the
idea
the
president
told
journalists
after
talking
to
lapierre
that
background
checks
are
now
off
the
table
while
adults
in
washington
fight
about
what
to
do
the
student
activists
of
march
for
our
lives
have
been
focused
for
more
than
a
year
on
voter
outreach
among
their
peers
their
movement
is
flourishing
with
more
than
chapters
across
the
country
and
growing
and
to
show
they're
serious
about
flexing
some
of
the
political
muscle
at
the
ballot
box
the
group
is
set
to
host
an
oct
candidates
forum
on
gun
violence
working
in
collaboration
with
the
anti-gun
violence
group
giffords
the
nonprofit
run
by
former
house
member
and
