u.s.
olympic
officials
drag
feet
on
sex
abuse
reforms
act
swiftly
to
stop
protests
during
anthem
priorities
once
again
the
u.s.
olympic
and
paralympic
committee
usopc
has
shown
it
cares
much
more
about
forcing
its
athletes
to
follow
arbitrary
rules
than
it
does
about
protecting
those
same
athletes
from
sexual
abuse
this
week
the
usopc
put
two
athletes
fencer
race
imboden
and
hammer
thrower
gwen
berry
on
probation
for
months
because
they
protested
systemic
racism
and
other
injustices
during
the
playing
of
the
national
anthem
at
the
pan
american
games
in
lima
peru
this
means
you
could
face
more
serious
sanctions
for
any
additional
breach
of
our
code
of
conduct
than
might
otherwise
be
levied
for
an
athlete
in
good
standing
said
usopc
ceo
sarah
hirshland
in
letters
written
to
the
two
athletes
and
subsequently
obtained
by
the
associated
press
hirshland
categorized
this
as
a
reprimand
not
an
actual
punishment
but
added
that
in
the
future
any
usopc
athlete
who
engages
in
similar
protests
will
be
squarely
punished
we
recognize
that
we
must
more
clearly
define
for
team
usa
athletes
what
a
breach
of
these
rules
will
mean
in
the
future
hirshland
wrote
working
with
the
athletes
and
national
governing
body
councils
we
are
committed
to
more
explicitly
defining
what
the
consequences
will
be
for
members
of
team
usa
who
protest
at
future
games
her
message
seemed
to
be
specifically
aimed
at
team
usa's
contingent
which
will
compete
in
the
tokyo
olympics
next
summer
on
one
hand
it's
refreshing
that
hirshland
didn't
ban
these
athletes
from
competing
in
future
events
however
even
probation
feels
like
an
overreach
as
does
the
preemptive
and
unsubtle
effort
to
prevent
athletes
from
protesting
at
the
tokyo
olympics
because
really
the
usopc
has
much
more
pressing
things
to
worry
about
just
last
month
a
senate
report
concluded
that
the
usopc
knowingly
concealed
abuse
by
former
usa
gymnastics
doctor
larry
nassar
leading
to
the
abuse
of
dozens
of
additional
amateur
athletes
during
the
period
beginning
the
summer
of
and
ending
in
september
despite
this
only
one
usopc
official
has
been
fired
over
the
nassar
scandal
nine
months
ago
the
usopc
said
it
was
decertifying
usa
gymnastics
for
enabling
rampant
sexual
abuse
but
then
failed
to
take
any
meaningful
action
to
follow
through
on
such
a
promise
just
this
week
the
usopc
proposed
sweeping
changes
but
they
are
still
just
proposals
a
full
four
years
after
the
organization
first
found
out
about
nassar's
abuse
and
those
proposals
only
materialized
after
the
senate
report
and
after
the
senate
put
forth
its
own
reform
plans
for
the
organization
which
would
give
the
government
much
much
more
oversight
one
would
think
that
all
of
the
usopc's
energy
would
be
focused
on
making
sure
the
epidemic
of
sexual
abuse
in
olympic
sports
is
put
to
an
end
instead
it's
concerned
about
the
optics
of
protesting
athletes
at
the
next
olympics
the
usopc
shouldn't
be
reprimanding
protesters
but
listening
to
them
and
learning
from
them
imboden
a
year-old
fencer
who
won
a
bronze
medal
in
the
olympics
took
a
knee
during
the
national
anthem
when
he
was
on
the
podium
receiving
his
gold
medal
for
the
team
foil
event
at
the
pan
am
games
on
social
media
he
made
it
clear
that
he
took
a
knee
because
of
the
multiple
shortcomings
of
the
country
including
r
acism
g
un
c
ontrol
mistreatment
of
immigrants
and
a
president
who
spreads
hate
i
chose
to
sacrifice
my
moment
today
at
the
top
of
the
podium
to
call
attention
to
issues
that
i
believe
need
to
be
addressed
imboden
said
i
encourage
others
to
please
use
your
platforms
for
empowerment
and
change
a
day
later
u.s.
hammer
thrower
gwen
berry
raised
her
first
during
the
national
anthem
when
she
was
atop
the
podium
receiving
her
gold
medal
just
a
testament
to
everything
i've
been
through
in
the
past
year
and
everything
the
country
has
been
through
this
past
year
berry
said
a
lot
of
things
need
to
be
done
and
said
and
changed
i'm
not
trying
to
start
a
political
war
or
act
like
i'm
miss-know-it-all
or
anything
like
that
i
just
know
america
can
do
better
america
can
do
better
so
can
the
usopc
but
for
hirshland
that's
beside
the
point
while
i
respect
your
perspective
and
that
of
every
athlete
for
whom
i'm
lucky
enough
to
serve
i
disagree
with
the
moment
and
manner
in
which
you
chose
to
express
your
views
she
said
in
the
letter
the
rules
we
operate
under
as
members
of
team
usa
exist
for
important
reasons
that
is
certainly
cold
comfort
to
survivors
everywhere
