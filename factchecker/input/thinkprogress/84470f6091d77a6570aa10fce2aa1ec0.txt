dayton
shooting
shows
six
good
guys
with
guns
are
no
match
for
a
high-capacity
magazine
police
in
dayton
did
their
jobs
very
well
nine
people
still
died
in
seconds
police
laid
connor
betts
down
for
good
about
seconds
after
he
first
fired
his
rifle
into
the
saturday
night
crowds
of
dayton
ohio's
main
bar
district
thirty-two
seconds
to
be
exact
according
to
an
atm
camera
that
captured
the
sounds
of
those
frantic
and
deadly
moments
between
betts
first
shot
and
the
last
one
fired
by
police
the
alacrity
and
heroism
of
police
officers
at
the
scene
stands
out
even
more
sharply
in
a
separate
sound-free
video
captured
by
a
bar
surveillance
camera
betts
was
just
one
stride
from
the
front
door
of
a
bar
into
which
hundreds
of
people
had
just
fled
his
fusillade
when
police
finally
stopped
him
had
it
taken
even
one
more
second
to
neutralize
him
the
videos
dayton
police
chief
richard
biehl
shared
with
the
press
on
sunday
show
he
could
well
have
gained
entrance
and
been
staring
at
what
amounted
to
a
human
shooting
gallery
yet
even
this
highly
efficient
peace-keeping
wasn't
enough
the
six
good
guys
with
guns
never
really
had
a
chance
to
prevent
carnage
the
best
they
could
do
and
they
really
did
do
their
very
best
was
to
limit
the
mayhem
in
just
seconds
betts
was
able
to
kill
nine
people
and
shoot
others
non-fatally
several
others
sustained
non-gunshot
injuries
in
the
sprinting
chaos
betts
attack
produced
on
the
street
police
explained
monday
police
recovered
shell
casings
matching
the
caliber
ammunition
that
betts
had
used
in
his
anderson
manufacturing
am-
he
fired
more
than
once
per
second
possibly
much
more
as
officers
cannot
be
certain
they
found
every
casing
all
in
just
half
a
minute
betts
had
attached
a
double-drum
magazine
with
a
maximum
capacity
of
rounds
to
his
am-
police
said
he
had
other
high-capacity
magazines
on
his
person
that
gave
him
a
total
maximum
capacity
of
rounds
he
had
not
filled
them
to
that
highest
possible
volume
police
said
monday
but
there's
no
strange
note
of
benevolence
to
that
choice
double-drum
setups
like
the
one
betts
used
are
notoriously
prone
to
jamming
making
them
a
subject
of
some
scorn
among
gun
aficionados
and
some
shooters
choose
to
under-load
them
in
order
to
improve
performance
the
six
officers
biehl
named
at
his
sunday
press
conference
as
the
heroes
of
the
day
who
took
the
killer
down
all
had
handguns
one
grabbed
a
high-powered
rifle
of
his
own
from
a
squad
car
all
did
their
utmost
nevertheless
the
gunman
armed
with
legally
available
equipment
had
more
than
enough
time
to
kill
nine
and
permanently
scar
dozens
more
in
the
few
states
that
ban
high-capacity
magazines
it
is
illegal
to
make
sell
or
purchase
such
equipment
nine
states
have
such
bans
eight
of
those
cap
magazine
capacity
at
rounds
for
long
guns
like
the
am-
betts
used
the
ninth
colorado
allows
magazines
as
large
as
rounds
kentucky-based
anderson
manufacturing
need
not
worry
about
such
laws
neither
did
betts
have
to
fret
ohio
kentucky
and
damn
near
everywhere
else
in
the
country
has
decided
these
things
are
fine
anderson
manufacturing
won't
sell
you
a
drum
mag
though
again
gun
nerds
typically
hate
the
things
and
make
fun
of
those
who
employ
them
anderson
manufacturing
will
happily
sell
you
round
magazines
however
the
standard
ones
retail
for
a
pop
for
another
you
can
get
them
with
the
don't
tread
on
me
snake
graphic
engraved
at
the
bottom
end
and
if
that
markup
is
too
steep
anderson's
sales
team
will
do
don't
tread
on
me
rounders
for
or
about
what
you'd
earn
before
taxes
on
a
day's
work
at
ohio's
minimum
hourly
wage
two
decades
ago
you
would
have
had
a
real
hard
time
buying
any
of
this
gear
the
federal
gun
legislation
that
lapsed
in
banned
magazines
with
a
capacity
greater
than
rounds
existing
high-cap
magazines
could
still
be
sold
under
one
of
the
law's
several
grandfathering
provisions
but
the
law
nonetheless
appeared
to
depress
the
public's
access
to
these
gun
accessories
the
share
of
high-capacity
magazines
recovered
from
gun
crime
investigations
in
virginia
initially
surged
but
then
fell
far
below
its
pre-ban
level
over
the
year
life
of
the
federal
law
for
example
consider
again
that
betts
came
within
about
a
step
of
reaching
the
door
to
a
bar
crammed
with
hundreds
of
defenseless
people
before
dayton's
finest
stopped
him
if
he'd
only
had
round
magazines
he'd
have
had
to
reload
at
least
once
by
then
if
he'd
had
or
round
magazines
he'd
have
had
to
execute
that
maneuver
three
four
potentially
five
times
for
every
second
he
was
roaming
that
street
he
was
letting
off
more
than
one
bullet
his
ability
to
skip
the
reloading
the
technological
enhancement
that
hardline
gun-rights
absolutists
have
insisted
he
and
every
other
american
have
ready
access
to
for
the
past
years
literally
cost
people
their
lives
today
these
high-capacity
magazines
are
legal
to
make
swap
and
sell
almost
everywhere
california's
ban
has
been
struck
down
then
temporarily
conditionally
reinstated
by
federal
courts
and
of
the
nine
states
that
have
resuscitated
a
high-cap
mag
ban
only
neighborless
hawaii
can
reasonably
claim
to
have
sheltered
its
citizens
from
the
threat
someone
like
betts
can
pose
using
tools
legal
in
of
the
country
some
congressional
democrats
have
tried
to
change
that
in
recent
years
the
keep
america
safe
act
introduced
in
the
senate
in
and
the
house
earlier
this
year
would
restore
the
high-capacity
magazine
rules
from
the
lapsed
and
sometimes
loathed
law
it
hasn't
made
it
out
of
committee
in
either
chamber
in
no
small
part
because
everyone
has
understood
these
past
years
that
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
would
never
allow
it
to
come
to
a
vote
even
if
everybody
else
did
the
work
required
to
push
it
through
the
house
