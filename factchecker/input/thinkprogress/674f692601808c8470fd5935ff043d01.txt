congressman
accidentally
compares
trump's
rhetoric
to
hitler
rep
lee
zeldin
r-ny
said
trump
must
like
jews
because
he
has
jewish
children
and
grandchildren
rep
lee
zeldin
r-ny
one
of
just
two
jewish
republicans
in
congress
and
a
staunch
defender
of
donald
trump
insisted
on
thursday
that
the
president
is
not
an
anti-semite
his
repeated
anti-semitic
comments
this
week
notwithstanding
in
his
attempt
to
explain
away
trump's
claim
that
jews
who
do
not
back
him
are
disloyal
however
zeldin
accidentally
compared
the
president
to
adolf
hitler
zeldin
was
asked
on
fox
news
whether
he
shares
trump's
view
that
if
you
vote
for
a
democrat
you
are
being
disloyal
to
jewish
people
and
you're
being
very
disloyal
to
israel
about
three-quarters
of
jewish
americans
voted
against
trump
in
the
election
and
democratic
candidates
received
an
even
higher
share
of
the
vote
in
zeldin
responded
by
praising
trump
who
has
made
an
array
of
anti-semitic
comments
defended
neo-nazis
as
very
fine
people
and
employed
people
like
steve
bannon
and
seb
gorka
as
an
ally
of
the
jewish
community
he
reasoned
that
although
the
president's
latest
statement
is
actually
a
hugely
offensive
trope
trump
shouldn't
be
condemned
for
it
because
he
has
jewish
relatives
there
is
a
long
history
with
regards
to
that
term
loyalty
or
disloyalty
zeldin
answered
where
others
with
bad
intent
with
hatred
towards
israel
and
the
jews
going
all
the
way
back
to
whether
it's
adolf
hitler
to
what
we're
seeing
right
now
in
other
ways
manifested
from
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
supporters
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
and
ilhan
omar
d-mn
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
has
been
an
issue
with
the
use
of
that
word
zeldin
has
repeatedly
criticized
both
congresswomen
accusing
them
of
backing
anti-semitic
causes
meanwhile
he
hosted
reelection
fundraisers
with
both
bannon
and
gorka
the
president
who
i
said
is
approaching
this
from
a
very
different
standpoint
he
chose
to
use
a
word
that
i
wouldn't
use
in
a
particular
context
he's
being
accused
of
anti-semitism
which
is
just
so
not
true
when
the
definition
of
anti-semitism
requires
a
hatred
towards
jews
and
he
has
shown
that
he
has
none
of
it
literally
his
son-in-law
his
daughter
his
grandchildren
are
jewish
hitler
reportedly
had
jewish
relatives
as
well
and
while
godwin's
law
has
discouraged
online
commentators
from
comparing
opponents
to
the
genocidal
nazi
f
hrer
zeldin
is
the
rare
politician
to
liken
someone's
comments
to
hitler's
in
their
defense
