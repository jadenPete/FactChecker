did
trump
just
spill
classified
military
secrets
on
twitter
whether
accurate
or
not
it's
an
alarming
admission
president
donald
trump
boasted
in
a
tweet
monday
evening
that
the
united
states
had
more
advanced
missiles
than
russia
following
a
rocket
explosion
in
the
country
that
left
five
nuclear
engineers
dead
if
his
tweet
is
accurate
it
suggests
the
united
states
has
technology
thought
to
have
been
abandoned
over
half
a
century
ago
it
also
means
the
president
may
have
revealed
classified
information
about
weapons
that
the
u.s.
military
may
currently
possess
some
experts
believe
the
president
may
have
simply
been
making
things
up
once
again
the
united
states
is
learning
much
from
the
failed
missile
explosion
in
russia
we
have
similar
though
more
advanced
technology
trump
tweeted
monday
referencing
the
incident
at
a
military
test
site
in
northern
russia
last
week
that
killed
five
employees
of
the
nation's
atomic
agency
rosatom
that
explosion
caused
a
spike
in
radiation
in
the
region
though
officials
dismissed
health
concerns
saying
the
levels
did
not
pose
any
danger
to
local
residents
trump
on
monday
however
claimed
that
the
explosion
has
people
worried
about
the
air
around
the
facility
and
far
beyond
not
good
the
technology
the
russians
were
testing
was
described
by
rosatom
as
a
nuclear
isotope
power
source
for
a
rocket
engine
details
of
the
accident
as
provided
by
russian
authorities
have
continued
to
shift
in
the
days
since
trump
appeared
to
confirm
in
his
tweet
monday
that
russia
was
testing
what
nato
has
referred
to
as
skyfall
russia's
experimental
nuclear-powered
cruise
missile
trump's
assertion
that
the
united
states
has
similar
though
more
advanced
technology
caused
alarm
and
confusion
among
defense
experts
not
only
does
this
appear
to
reveal
classified
military
information
but
it
also
contradicts
a
historical
understanding
that
the
united
states
abandoned
such
research
in
joe
cirincione
president
of
the
nuclear
nonproliferation
ploughshares
fund
and
author
of
nuclear
nightmares
gave
context
for
the
history
of
these
failed
experiments
in
a
tweet
monday
evening
this
is
bizarre
he
wrote
we
do
not
have
a
nuclear-powered
cruise
missile
program
we
tried
to
build
one
in
the
s
but
it
was
too
crazy
too
unworkable
too
cruel
even
for
those
nuclear
nuts
cold
war
years
as
he
later
explained
to
msnbc
the
united
states
once
pursued
project
pluto
a
missile
that
would
have
contained
an
unshielded
nuclear
reactor
spewing
radiation
everywhere
it
went
researchers
concluded
such
a
weapon
was
too
cruel
too
insane
too
ridiculous
and
was
unnecessary
as
cirincione
described
it
the
skyfall
missile
would
be
different
from
this
in
that
it
would
merely
be
powered
by
a
nuclear
reactor
and
is
hypothetically
not
designed
to
spread
radiation
everywhere
it
travels
the
exception
of
course
is
when
it
explodes
as
evident
from
the
radiation
spread
by
the
accident
that
took
place
last
week
while
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
united
states
has
secretly
continued
to
pursue
some
form
of
this
technology
some
national
security
experts
are
still
concerned
about
trump's
facile
references
to
the
nation's
military
capability
stephen
schwartz
a
senior
fellow
at
the
bulletin
of
the
atomic
scientists
was
doubtful
of
trump's
claims
but
he
noted
that
if
the
united
states
was
truly
pursuing
such
technology
it
must
be
a
highly
classified
program
like
cirincione
he
decried
the
efforts
of
project
pluto
calling
the
project
stupid
unnecessary
and
extremely
hazardous
the
tweet
likewise
raised
big
red
flags
for
foreign
policy
scholars
like
michael
mcfaul
former
ambassador
to
russia
and
david
burbach
associate
professor
at
the
u.s.
naval
war
college
it
is
a
bad
idea
for
the
president
to
tell
the
world
the
u.s.
has
secret
nuclear
powered
super-weapons
and
that
we've
been
lying
about
that
for
years
especially
if
we
don't
actually
have
them
which
we
almost
certainly
do
not
burbach
tweeted
we
have
similar
technology
nuclear-powered
cruise
missiles
i
wasn't
read
into
that
program
when
i
worked
at
the
national
security
council
can
anyone
shed
more
light
mcfaul
tweeted
separately
thinkprogress
reached
out
to
the
department
of
defense
which
declined
to
comment
both
on
what
weapons
the
country
possesses
and
the
implications
of
trump's
tweet
referring
any
questions
specifically
about
the
skyfall
explosion
to
russia
thinkprogress
also
reached
out
to
the
national
security
council
for
comment
but
had
not
heard
back
at
the
time
of
publication
