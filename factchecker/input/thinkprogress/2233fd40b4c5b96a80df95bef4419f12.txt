americans
today
will
seek
comfort
and
reassurance
from
president
trump
good
luck
with
that
the
very
act
of
uniting
people
is
antithetical
to
this
president
once
upon
a
time
when
residents
of
the
united
states
found
themselves
under
attack
from
those
looking
to
do
us
harm
americans
sought
comfort
assurance
and
leadership
from
the
person
duly
elected
to
provide
all
of
the
above
we
know
somehow
that
what
happened
to
you
has
pierced
the
soul
of
america
said
president
bill
clinton
on
may
shortly
after
the
killings
of
people
at
columbine
high
school
in
littleton
colorado
the
face
of
terror
is
not
the
true
faith
of
islam
that's
not
what
islam
is
all
about
islam
is
peace
these
terrorists
don't
represent
peace
they
represent
evil
and
war
said
president
george
w.
bush
on
september
standing
inside
the
islamic
center
of
washington
d.c.
six
days
after
the
deadliest
attack
on
american
soil
amazing
grace
how
sweet
the
sound
that
saved
a
wretch
like
me
i
once
was
lost
but
now
am
found
sang
president
barack
obama
on
june
in
an
impromptu
chorus
with
a
mourning
crowd
at
the
funeral
for
rev
clementa
pinckney
one
of
the
nine
victims
of
the
emanuel
a.m.e.
church
massacre
in
charleston
south
carolina
fake
news
has
contributed
greatly
to
the
anger
and
rage
that
has
built
up
over
many
years
news
coverage
has
got
to
start
being
fair
balanced
and
unbiased
or
these
terrible
problems
will
only
get
worse
said
donald
trump
on
twitter
hours
after
a
white
supremacist
murdered
more
than
people
and
uploaded
a
manifesto
that
echoed
some
of
trump's
own
speeches
and
tweets
what
the
united
states
needs
in
times
of
tragedy
and
sorrow
is
a
unifier
what
some
have
dubbed
a
consoler
in
chief
it's
a
role
that
has
been
fulfilled
to
great
effect
by
even
the
least
popular
presidents
bush's
remarks
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
september
terrorist
attacks
were
viewed
as
a
unifying
balm
to
the
nation
even
by
many
who
disliked
his
politics
his
approval
rating
languishing
at
just
before
the
attacks
shot
up
to
in
less
than
two
weeks
according
to
gallup
trump
of
course
is
but
a
pale
facsimile
of
those
who
came
before
him
but
that
hasn't
stopped
his
allies
and
an
alarming
number
of
media
figures
from
trying
to
shoehorn
him
into
the
same
consoler
in
chief
role
that
his
predecessors
occupied
with
varying
measures
of
aplomb
not
only
has
trump
proven
to
be
incapable
of
acting
as
a
unifier
but
the
very
act
of
uniting
americans
is
antithetical
to
his
worldview
to
unify
is
to
strip
trump
of
what
might
be
his
most
prominent
innate
skill
driving
people
apart
witness
his
reaction
to
obama's
call
to
root
out
the
kind
of
racism
that
was
at
the
core
of
saturday's
shooting
in
el
paso
obama
in
a
statement
shared
via
twitter
called
out
those
who
sow
divisions
between
people
without
naming
any
names
all
of
us
have
to
send
a
clarion
call
and
behave
with
the
values
of
tolerance
and
diversity
that
should
be
the
hallmark
of
our
democracy
obama
said
we
should
soundly
reject
language
coming
out
of
the
mouths
of
any
of
our
leaders
that
feeds
a
climate
of
fear
and
hatred
or
normalizes
racist
sentiments
leaders
who
demonize
those
who
don't
look
like
us
or
suggest
that
other
people
including
immigrants
threaten
our
way
of
life
or
refer
to
other
people
as
sub-human
or
imply
that
america
belongs
to
just
one
certain
type
of
people
it
has
no
place
in
our
politics
and
our
public
life
and
it's
time
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
of
goodwill
of
every
race
and
faith
and
political
party
to
say
as
much
clearly
and
unequivocally
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
trump
to
simply
hit
the
retweet
button
or
say
nothing
at
all
instead
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
attack
his
predecessor
you
know
unity
now
this
isn't
to
say
trump
isn't
going
through
the
motions
unlike
the
explicit
overtures
he
made
to
neo-nazis
and
white
nationalists
in
after
they
murdered
someone
in
charlottesville
virginia
trump
read
a
carefully
worded
statement
on
a
teleprompter
this
week
condemning
the
kind
white
supremacy
and
racism
that
his
own
words
have
tacitly
encouraged
astonishingly
his
hollow
comments
were
enough
to
appease
among
others
the
editors
at
the
new
york
times
who
initially
ran
a
front-page
story
under
the
headline
trump
urges
unity
vs
racism
before
widespread
public
shock
and
ridicule
shamed
them
to
change
it
in
later
editions
of
the
print
paper
but
trump
can't
even
cosplay
as
a
president
convincingly
in
one
of
his
first
remarks
about
the
el
paso
massacre
on
twitter
naturally
he
expressed
sadness
over
the
loss
of
life
while
in
the
same
breath
reiterating
the
need
for
his
racist
brand
of
immigration
reform
the
very
rhetoric
that
inspired
a
gunman
to
open
fire
on
a
largely
latinx
community
with
the
intent
to
murder
as
many
people
as
possible
in
times
of
national
mourning
presidents
often
travel
to
the
sites
of
tragedy
to
comfort
those
communities
that
are
suffering
most

yet
another
set
of
remarks

trump
plans
to

he
likely
will
be
met
with
