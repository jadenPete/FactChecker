the
candidate
wanted
her
town
to
stay
as
white
as
possible
now
she's
out
of
the
race
jean
cramer
dropped
out
of
the
marysville
michigan
city
council
race
after
embarrassing
her
town
and
herself
by
saying
foreigners
should
stay
away
it's
unfortunate
that
jean
cramer's
racist
comments
forced
her
to
drop
out
of
the
marysville
michigan
city
council
race
no
really
i'm
sincere
in
regretting
that
she's
not
continuing
her
campaign
cramer
appeared
last
week
at
a
community
forum
and
rejected
out
of
hand
the
notion
that
there
could
be
value
in
attracting
a
diverse
population
to
her
town
not
far
from
the
canadian
border
and
about
miles
northeast
of
detroit
her
racist
response
to
the
moderator's
question
stunned
many
in
the
audience
and
made
national
headlines
my
suggestion
recommendation
keep
marysville
a
white
community
as
much
as
possible
she
said
without
a
trace
of
self-awareness
to
the
insensitivity
of
her
comment
white
seriously
in
other
words
no
foreign-born
no
foreign
people
after
a
weekend
of
condemnation
from
embarrassed
townsfolk
and
a
barrage
of
negative
attention
from
the
national
media
cramer
submitted
written
notification
to
the
city
withdrawing
from
the
council
race
officials
for
marysville
in
a
facebook
post
wrote
that
cramer's
name
would
remain
on
the
ballot
because
her
withdrawal
occurred
after
the
april
deadline
set
by
the
state
elections
board
in
an
interview
with
cnn
mayor
dan
damman
applauded
cramer's
decision
to
stop
embarrassing
the
city
i
had
publicly
asked
her
to
withdraw
the
day
after
she
made
the
initial
statement
and
public
sentiment
from
our
residents
was
swift
and
bold
as
they
rejected
her
ideology
damman
wrote
in
an
email
to
cnn
it
is
my
sincere
hope
that
she
withdrew
because
she
recognized
that
her
belief
system
and
ideology
have
no
place
in
public
service
not
in
marysville
not
anywhere
the
city's
mayor
pro
tem
kathy
hayman
was
apoplectic
about
cramer's
comments
saying
that
she
took
them
personally
because
her
late
father
was
a
syrian-born
immigrant
who
ran
a
business
and
held
elected
office
in
the
community
for
years
in
fact
the
very
room
that
the
meeting
took
place
was
named
to
honor
her
father
joseph
johns
so
basically
what
you've
said
is
that
my
father
and
his
family
had
no
business
to
be
in
this
community
hayman
told
cramer
a
reporter
for
the
port
huron
times-herald
approached
her
after
the
forum
to
ask
if
she
wanted
to
clarify
her
earlier
comments
and
respond
to
hayman
she
obliged
by
saying
more
racist
and
xenophobic
things
as
long
as
how
can
i
put
this
what
kathy
hayman
doesn't
know
is
that
her
family
is
in
the
wrong
she
told
the
reporter
husband
and
wife
need
to
be
the
same
race
same
thing
with
kids
that's
how
it's
been
from
the
beginning
of
how
can
i
say
when
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
he
created
adam
and
eve
at
the
same
time
but
as
far
as
me
being
against
blacks
no
i'm
not
while
i
find
cramer's
views
repugnant
they
are
refreshingly
honest
and
void
of
the
mealy-mouth
comments
so
often
uttered
by
poll-tested
politicians
indeed
cramer
seemed
more
than
willing
to
defend
her
racist
views
in
follow-up
interviews
with
local
media
maybe
she
would
have
stood
by
her
comments
to
the
bitter
end
if
not
pressed
out
of
the
race
but
such
is
not
to
be
without
cramer
on
the
hustings
there's
no
way
to
know
how
the
denizens
of
maryville
would
have
ultimately
responded
to
her
views
it's
something
every
american
might
have
dearly
benefitted
from
knowing
and
understanding
especially
in
this
racially
fraught
political
moment
to
be
clear
i
would
have
loved
to
have
heard
cramer
debate
her
views
and
defend
so
overtly
a
racist
opinion
during
the
campaign
what's
more
i'm
curious
to
know
just
how
much
support
cramer
would
have
received
in
the
community
that's
white
and
located
near
the
canadian
border
about
miles
northeast
of
detroit
after
all
she
has
lived
in
the
community
since
according
to
property
records
she
was
well-known
enough
to
become
a
qualified
candidate
for
the
council
which
means
that
a
significant
number
of
residents
knew
something
about
her
public
views
presumably
many
people
in
marysville
knew
or
shared
her
racist
vision
for
the
future
of
their
town
well
enough
to
encourage
her
to
run
for
office
i
regret
she's
not
continuing
to
campaign
because
hearing
her
views
represents
an
excellent
test
of
her
city's
values
and
a
missed
opportunity
for
those
of
us
who
don't
live
in
marysville
to
learn
something
real
and
candid
about
people
who
inhabit
our
nation
