falsely
claims
kids
are
barred
from
praying
in
school

again
reiterated
his
widely-debunked
claims
that
video
games
cause
mass
shootings
republican
texas
lt
gov
dan
patrick
doubled
down
on
his
widely
debunked
claims
about
the
root
cause
of
mass
shootings
suggesting
video
games
and
lack
of
school
prayer
are
the
real
problems
patrick
a
far-right
dominionist
who
has
routinely
urged
the
christian
bible
be
used
as
the
source
for
public
policies
was
on
fox
news
on
thursday
morning
to
discuss
the
mass
shooting
this
past
weekend
in
el
paso
texas
he
praised
president
donald
trump's
wednesday
photo
opportunity
and
offered
non-committal
comments
about
background
checks
and
red
flag
laws
then
he
launched
into
a
tirade
about
the
decline
of
american
culture
echoing
his
comments
earlier
in
the
week
that
violent
video
games
and
the
lack
of
school
prayer
are
the
reason
for
mass
shootings
the
issue
for
me
is
that
this
is
not
just
about
guns
it's
not
just
about
mental
health
it's
about
our
culture
a
culture
where
we
have
lost
our
moral
compass
patrick
said
it
is
about
video
games
is
about
dark
webs
like
it
is
about
social
media
bullying
they
talk
about
all
of
these
people
this
kid
was
a
white
supremacist
he
came
here
to
kill
mexicans
that
is
what
he's
told
police
we
have
to
look
at
that
parents
said
that
they
brought
him
up
he
was
a
loner
because
of
the
web
there
are
no
more
loners
anymore
they
are
all
connected
to
each
other
they
feed
off
of
each
other
they
keep
score
on
their
games
how
many
head
shots
did
they
how
many
points
did
they
score
this
guy
is
going
to
be
a
martyr
on
the
dark
web
just
like
the
shooter
in
santa
fe
was
held
after
his
shootings
because
he
carried
it
out
patrick
then
connected
the
shooting
to
a
popular
video
game
series
though
every
major
study
has
found
no
causal
effect
between
violent
games
and
violent
behavior
remember
this
manifesto
this
young
man
this
alleged
shooter
said
to
fulfill
your
super
soldier
fantasy
which
is
in
the
call
of
duty
video
game
he
said
finally
he
offered
a
bizarre
and
false
argument
that
kids
cannot
pray
or
bring
up
mass
shootings
in
schools
i
came
in
yesterday
but
on
sunday
everyone
was
going
to
church
in
america
praying
about
this
and
the
next
day
when
their
kids
went
to
school
they
weren't
allowed
to
pray
or
bring
it
up
he
said
we
are
a
society
that
is
good
good
people
black
brown
white
with
extremism
on
both
sides
evil
around
us
and
we
as
a
country
god-fearing
god
loving
country
we
have
to
take
control
of
our
own
society
patrick
is
of
course
wrong
that
everyone
in
the
nation
went
to
church
on
sunday
to
pray
just
about
percent
of
the
nation
is
part
of
a
christian
faith
less
than
a
third
of
americans
attend
church
or
synagogue
on
a
weekly
basis
he
is
also
wrong
about
public
education
while
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
official
prayer
in
schools
violates
the
constitutional
principle
of
separation
of
church
and
state
students
have
always
been
free
to
pray
during
the
school
day
texas
law
expressly
requires
a
minute-long
moment
of
silence
where
they
can
pray
each
day
indeed
his
own
state's
law
makes
clear
a
public
school
student
has
an
absolute
right
to
individually
voluntarily
and
silently
pray
or
meditate
in
school
in
a
manner
that
does
not
disrupt
the
instructional
or
other
activities
of
the
school
a
person
may
not
require
encourage
or
coerce
a
student
to
engage
in
or
refrain
from
such
prayer
or
meditation
during
any
school
activity
no
federal
or
state
law
prohibits
the
discussion
of
mass
shootings
or
other
gun
violence
in
schools
texas
lawmakers
rolled
back
the
state's
already
permissive
gun
laws
patrick
has
consistently
backed
those
efforts
