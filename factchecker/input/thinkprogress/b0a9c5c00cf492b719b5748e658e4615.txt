r-sc
admitted
to
a
local
radio
station
this
week
that
if
republicans
regain
control
of
congress
in
the
elections
they
will
do
what
they
failed
to
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
trump
administration
repeal
obamacare
in
a
monday
radio
interview
first
flagged
by
the

blog
joe
my
god
graham
explained
that
the
next
election
would
be
about
health
care
repeal
this
is
what
is
about
if
we
can
get
the
house
back
and
keep
our
majority
in
the
senate
and
president
trump
wins
re-election
i
can
promise
you
not
only
are
we
going
to
repeal
obamacare
we're
going
to
do
it
in
a
smart
way
where
south
carolina
will
be
the
biggest
winner
graham
told
host
joey
hudson
three
senate
republicans
joined
with
every
senate
democrat
to
kill
trumpcare
a
plan
to
repeal
most
of
the
provisions
and
protections
of
the
popular
affordable
care
act
commonly
known
as
obamacare
prior
to
the
elections
graham
then
pushed
a
graham-cassidy
block
grant
bill
which
would
have
given
more
money
and
authority
to
states
that
did
not
expand
medicaid
but
that
also
died
due
to
lack
of
majority
support
democrats
who
vowed
to
preserve
and
improve
obamacare
along
with
its
patient
protections
gained
seats
to
take
control
of
the
house
in
the
midterm
blue
wave
they
even
picked
up
a
republican-held
house
seat
in
south
carolina
rather
than
learn
the
lessons
of
graham
made
it
clear
that
his
party
plans
to
return
to
the
same
playbook
that
failed
a
year
ago
since
then-president
barack
obama
signed
obamacare
into
law
in
more
than
million
americans
have
gained
health
insurance
update
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
d-ny
blasted
graham
on
friday
tweeting
republicans
are
still
trying
to
take
away
protections
for
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
kick
tens
of
millions
off
their
health
coverage
