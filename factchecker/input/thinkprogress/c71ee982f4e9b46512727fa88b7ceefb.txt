tribe
raises
stakes
in
dakota
access
pipeline
fight
amid
surge
in
democratic
support
battles
over
keystone
xl
and
the
dakota
access
pipeline
are
rapidly
emerging
as
electoral
issues
the
standing
rock
sioux
are
renewing
their
battle
against
the
controversial
dakota
access
oil
pipeline
just
as
several
democratic
presidential
contenders
are
increasingly
voicing
opposition
to
fossil
fuel
projects
and
seeking
to
make
inroads
with
native
voters
pipeline
efforts
including
the
dakota
access
project
or
dapl
have
long
garnered
support
from
president
donald
trump
even
as
indigenous
communities
and
activists
have
pushed
back
arguing
that
the
pipelines
will
harm
human
health
and
the
environment
presidential
candidates
like
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
have
slammed
those
fossil
fuel
efforts
indicating
that
the
pipeline
wars
could
become
a
key
electoral
issue
next
year
on
friday
the
standing
rock
sioux
asked
a
federal
court
to
throw
out
what
the
tribe
says
is
a
flawed
environmental
assessment
of
dapl's
potential
impacts
the
army
corps
of
engineers
never
engaged
with
the
tribe
or
its
technical
experts
shared
critical
information
or
responded
to
the
tribe's
concerns
the
page
motion
reads
at
issue
is
a
key
february
environmental
easement
which
enabled
the
corps
to
proceed
with
dapl
construction
that
easement
allowed
energy
transfer
partners
which
controls
the
pipeline
to
avoid
an
environmental
impact
statement
which
would
have
required
a
thorough
review
of
dapl's
potential
impacts
to
water
and
wildlife
in
june
a
federal
district
judge
ordered
the
army
corps
to
consider
environmental
impacts
following
litigation
from
the
tribe
that
ruling
yielded
no
real
change
however
the
government
still
allowed
the
pipeline
to
go
forward
but
the
standing
rock
sioux
say
the
army
corps
failed
to
engage
with
them
over
dapl's
environmental
threat
and
that
they
remain
at
risk
of
an
oil
spill
earthjustice
an
environmental
legal
group
filed
friday's
motion
on
behalf
of
the
tribe
arguing
for
a
pause
in
construction
while
dapl's
potential
impacts
are
assessed
again
this
time
with
input
from
the
tribe
moreover
the
tribe
is
taking
aim
at
a
newly-proposed
expansion
of
the
pipeline
announced
in
june
of
this
year
that
would
see
its
capacity
enlarged
to
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
dapl
currently
produces
around
half
that
amount
with
dapl's
proposal
to
double
the
flow
of
the
pipeline
the
unexamined
risks
to
the
tribe
continue
to
grow
the
tribe
asserts
if
friday's
motion
is
granted
dapl
would
be
forced
to
shut
down
until
the
army
corps
conducts
an
environmental
review
the
pipeline
currently
runs
from
north
dakota's
shale
oil
fields
down
through
south
dakota
and
iowa
into
illinois
the
tribe
has
indicated
they
intend
to
fight
dapl
in
any
way
they
can
this
illegal
and
dangerous
pipeline
must
be
shut
down
said
mike
faith
standing
rock
sioux
chairman
in
a
statement
it
is
unclear
whether
the
standing
rock
sioux
will
be
successful
in
their
efforts
but
they
already
have
support
from
several
democratic
presidential
contenders
last
week
warren
became
the
first
candidate
to
sign
on
to
the
nokxl
pledge
an
anti-pipeline
effort
backed
by
groups
including
the
pro-water
and
land
conservation
organization
bold
nebraska
the
pledge
targets
the
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
along
with
dapl
and
other
fossil
fuel
efforts
like
the
mountain
valley
and
atlantic
coast
fracked
natural
gas
pipelines
in
appalachia
signatories
of
the
pledge
commit
to
opposing
all
of
these
projects
other
presidential
candidates
have
also
embraced
the
nokxl
pledge
gov
jay
inslee
d-wa
quickly
followed
warren
asking
where
do
i
sign
in
a
tweet
expressing
his
support
inslee
has
devoted
his
entire
campaign
to
climate
action
and
has
promised
to
shift
the
united
states
to
net-zero
emissions
by
sanders

billionaire
tom
steyer
have
signed
as
well
both
candidates
have
been
vocal
on
climate
issues
bold
nebraska
told
thinkprogress
they
believe
other
contenders
will
sign
as
the
pledge
gains
momentum
polling
shows
that
climate
issues
are
gaining
traction
with
u.s.
voters
and
many
are
growing
skeptical
of
fossil
fuels
but
pipeline
projects
are
also
emerging
as
an
opportunity
for
democrats
to
make
inroads
with
indigenous
communities
who
have
played
a
leading
role
in
fighting
fossil
fuel
expansion
that
often
takes
place
on
their
tribal
lands
and
could
be
a
key
voting
base
in
some
states
this
week
a
number
of
presidential
candidates
including
warren
and
sanders
are
gathering
in
sioux
city
iowa
for
a
presidential
forum
exclusively
devoted
to
native
american
issues
audience
members
will
ask
candidates
about
a
range
of
topics
and
pipelines
and
climate
concerns
are
likely
to
come
up
warren
preemptively
laid
out
her
approach
on
friday
in
a
series
of
tweets
about
native
issues
she
expanded
on
her
opposition
to
keystone
xl
and
dapl
and
framed
her
views
in
the
context
of
indigenous
rights
when
tribal
concerns
have
conflicted
with
corporate
profits
or
resource
extraction
tribes
lose
this
has
to
change
