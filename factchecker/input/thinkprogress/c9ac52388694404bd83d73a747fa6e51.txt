jailed
saudi
activist
refuses
to
deny
being
tortured
in
exchange
for
freedom
saudi
arabia
a
close
u.s.
ally
is
trying
to
sweep
the
torture
of
prisoners
under
the
rug
it's
not
working
it's
been
over
a
year
since
women
have
been
allowed
to
drive
in
saudi
arabia
but
several
of
the
activists
who
brought
about
that
change
are
still
locked
up
awaiting
trial
and
now
the
family
of
one
of
the
activists
loujain
al-hathloul
says
that
the
saudi
government
offered
to
release
her
if
she
promises
to
deny
allegations
of
torture
while
in
prison
al
hathloul's
siblings
took
to
twitter
on
tuesday
to
share
what
they
knew
about
the
proposal
put
forth
by
the
saudi
authorities
her
brother
walid
offered
more
details
in
a
thread
in
which
he
said
sister
was
asked
to
give
filmed
testimony
denying
mistreatment
in
exchange
for
freedom
the
family
had
initially
agreed
some
weeks
ago
he
wrote
that
loujain
would
sign
a
statement
to
that
effect
but
the
authorities
came
back
demanding
a
video
of
the
statement
as
well
loujain
he
writes
rejected
the
offer
al-hathloul
has
been
locked
up
since
may
when
saudi
authorities
rounded
up
activists
shortly
before
the
driving
ban
was
to
be
lifted
the
arrests
took
place
because
the
authorities
didn't
want
the
activists
to
take
credit
for
the
change
in
policy
the
official
line
was
that
the
policy
changed
because
of
the
benevolence
of
crown
prince
mohamed
bin
salman
also
known
as
mbs
who
is
a
friend
and
an
ally
of
the
trump
administration
the
saudi
government
has
painted
these
activists
as
traitors
attacking
their
characters
in
state-owned
media
by
november
reports
started
to
surface
of
the
activists
being
tortured
amnesty
international
released
the
testimonies
of
prisoners
saying
that
they
had
been
electrocuted
flogged
and
suspended
from
the
ceiling
at
the
time
this
story
broke
president
donald
trump
who
had
refused
to
blame
saudi
arabia
for
the
murder
of
dissident
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
remained
silent
on
the
topic
instead
he
thanked
saudi
arabia
for
increasing
its
oil
production
and
lowering
prices
in
april
saudi
arabia
arrested
even
more
activists
including
two
dual
u.s.
saudi
citizens
these
activists
had
spoken
out
in
support
of
those
who
have
been
locked
up
since
may
earlier
this
month
the
gulf
arab
kingdom
announced
that
it
would
allow
women
to
travel
without
permission
from
a
male
guardian
meaning
a
woman
who
is
or
older
could
get
a
passport
and
travel
without
the
signature
of
a
male
relative
guardianship
laws
in
saudi
arabia
govern
virtually
every
aspect
of
women's
lives
personal
and
legal
they
need
the
permission
of
a
male
relative
to
get
married
or
to
live
by
themselves
this
repressive
guardianship
system
is
largely
the
reason
why
an
increasing
number
of
women
have
tried
to
escape
the
kingdom
seeking
amnesty
in
countries
such
as
australia
and
the
united
kingdom
loujain
al-hathloul
has
been
a
high-profile
activist
for
women's
rights
in
saudi
arabia
fighting
not
only
for
women's
right
to
drive
but
against
guardianship
laws
she
had
been
arrested
several
times
before
with
the
most
remarkable
incident
being
when
she
was
pulled
over
while
driving
in
the
uae
where
she
was
enrolled
in
a
master's
program
at
the
sorbonne
campus
in
abu
dhabi
hauled
out
of
her
car
taken
to
the
saudi
capital
of
riyadh
and
thrown
in
prison
she
was
released
banned
from
leaving
the
country
then
arrested
again
two
months
later
since
then
her
parents
have
witnessed
her
health
deteriorate
in
detention
her
sister
alia
wrote
in
a
january
op-ed
in
the
new
york
times
that
al-hathloul
initially
tried
to
hide
her
pain
from
their
parents
blaming
the
difficulty
she
had
sitting
and
moving
on
the
air
conditioning
but
by
december
things
were
bad
and
she
broke
down
and
told
her
parents
what
she
had
been
forced
to
endure
al-hathloul
told
her
parent
that
mbs's
top
royal
adviser
saud
al-qahtani
had
been
present
at
several
of
her
torture
sessions
al-qahtani
also
oversaw
the
murder
and
dismemberment
of
khashoggi
via
skype
according
to
bellingcat
al-qahtani
has
a
history
of
popping
up
in
hacker
forums
and
posting
while
by
his
own
admission
drunk
he
was
fired
at
the
behest
of
the
trump
administration
which
included
him
on
a
list
of
saudis
barred
from
entering
the
united
states
he
still
remains
in
mbs's
inner
circle
albeit
in
a
less
official
capacity
there
are
also
reports
that
he
has
been
placed
under
house
arrest
his
presence
at
al-hathloul's
torture
sessions
though
speaks
to
the
official
capacity
in
which
the
mistreatment
took
place
her
beatings
were
not
off-the-books
rogue
operations
while
president
trump
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
have
kept
largely
mum
about
loujaine
al-hathloul's
case
and
others
like
it
the
state
department's
own
human
rights
country
report
released
in
march
mentions
her
and
many
others
however
the
report
also
uses
language
that
casts
doubt
on
the
human
rights
violations
it
cites
saying
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
the
legal
basis
for
incarceration
and
whether
the
detention
complied
with
international
norms
and
standards
none
of
what
has
been
listed
in
the
report
from
human
rights
violations
in
saudi
arabia
to
its
role
in
the
deaths
of
tens
of
thousands
of
yemeni
civilians
in
the
war
there
has
stopped
the
trump
administration
from
strengthening
its
ties
with
saudi
arabia
this
includes
an
billion
arms
deal
and
approving
the
transfer
of
nuclear
technology
to
the
gulf
kingdom
