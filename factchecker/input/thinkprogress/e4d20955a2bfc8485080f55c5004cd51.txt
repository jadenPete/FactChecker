after
trump
broke
his
promise
to
eliminate
the
national
debt
gop
senators
say
next
term
the
rule
is
jam
to-morrow
and
jam
yesterday
but
never
jam
to-day
lewis
carroll
under
president
donald
trump
both
the
national
debt
and
the
annual
budget
deficit
have
reached
all
time
highs
despite
his
campaign
promises
to
eliminate
both
rather
than
concede
another
broken
promise
his
republican
defenders
in
the
senate
are
now
claiming
that
he
will
solve
both
next
term
candidate
donald
trump
made
a
lot
of
unrealistic
promises
his
oft
repeated
and
now
abandoned
mantra
that
mexico
would
entirely
fund
a
massive
border
wall
across
the
nation's
entire
southern
border
is
the
best
known
but
he
also
made
numerous
lofty
promises
to
magically
eliminate
the
trillion
national
debt
and
to
get
rid
of
the
budget
deficit
almost
immediately
from
his
campaign
kickoff
speech
trump
promised
that
he
would
make
the
debt
disappear
i
think
i
could
do
it
fairly
quickly
because
of
the
fact
the
numbers
he
told
the
washington
post
in
i
would
say
over
a
period
of
eight
years
trump
said
he
could
do
this
without
even
raising
taxes
because
of
the
spectacular
trade
deals
that
he
uniquely
would
be
able
to
negotiate
if
elected
the
national
debt
is
now
more
than
trillion
several
trillion
higher
than
when
trump
took
office
trump
has
claimed
to
have
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
our
country
but
thanks
to
a
massive
tax
cut
for
corporations
and
the
wealthiest
americans
the
annual
budget
deficit
is
about
to
exceed
trillion
for
the
first
time
ever
even
without
purchasing
greenland
years
before
analysts
expected
trump
recently
signed
a
budget
deal
agreed
to
by
the
gop-controlled
senate
that
further
increased
spending
despite
his
campaign
promise
to
freeze
the
budget
and
despite
promising
last
year
that
he
would
never
sign
another
bill
with
big
spending
increases
again
should
the
widely-predicted
economic
downturn
happen
that
would
mean
even
less
revenue
which
would
make
spending
cuts
even
more
difficult
according
to
a
washington
post
report
on
friday
trump
and
his
allies
have
arrived
at
a
solution
to
the
problem
pretending
that
it
will
all
be
fixed
in
trump's
second
term
the
article
notes
that
senate
majority
whip
john
thune
r-sd
recently
suggested
to
the
new
york
times
that
trump's
deficit
reduction
efforts
might
come
as
soon
as
i
hope
in
a
second
term
he
is
interested
he
suggested
with
his
leadership
i
think
we
could
start
dealing
with
that
crisis
and
it
is
a
crisis
senate
republican
conference
chairman
john
barrasso
r-wy
told
the
times
we've
brought
it
up
with
president
trump
who
has
talked
about
it
being
a
second-term
project
and
sen
david
perdue
r-ga
added
that
it
probably
takes
a
second-term
president
to
prioritize
debt
reduction
back
in
july
the
post
noted
leaks
from
the
white
house
gave
the
impression
that
in
a
second
trump
term
spending
cuts
and
deficit
reduction
would
be
coming
trump's
track
record
with
debt
however
would
suggest
that
this
promise
too
is
unlikely
to
be
kept
