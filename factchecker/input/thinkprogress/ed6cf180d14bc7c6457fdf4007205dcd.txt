support
for
unions
is
high
in
but
membership
is
still
on
the
decline
the
highest
approval
for
unions
in
a
decade
but
the
picture
for
labor
is
not
a
completely
rosy
one
a
mixed
bag
of
high
approval
declining
membership
and
stubbornly
low
wages
greets
a
proud
but
anxious
workforce
as
americans
prepare
to
step
away
from
their
jobs
this
labor
day
weekend
according
to
a
gallup
poll
released
this
week
ahead
of
monday's
federal
holiday
of
americans
say
they
approve
of
unions
a
dramatic
increase
of
over
a
record-low
figure
registered
in
this
marks
the
third
consecutive
year
that
more
than
of
the
poll's
respondents
have
expressed
support
for
unions
and
this
year's
survey
saw
labor
unions
garner
their
fourth-highest
approval
rate
of
the
past
years
americans
held
higher
opinions
of
unions
in
march
august
and
august
higher
public
support
for
unions
in
the
past
few
years
likely
reflects
the
relatively
good
economic
conditions
in
place
particularly
low
unemployment
gallup
said
in
a
statement
released
with
its
findings
by
contrast
the
lowest
union
approval
ratings
in
gallup
history
came
from
through
years
of
high
unemployment
that
followed
the
great
recession
this
year
is
something
of
a
milestone
it's
the
th
anniversary
of
labor
day
a
holiday
dating
back
to
president
grover
cleveland's
signing
in
of
a
law
to
create
a
federal
holiday
to
honor
and
celebrate
the
nation's
working
people
gallup
noted
that
over
decades
of
measuring
the
public's
opinion
toward
organized
labor
from
through
positive
attitudes
consistently
exceeded
from
onward
positive
views
tracked
about
lower
on
average
and
rarely
exceeded
gallup
said
americans
of
all
stripes
and
political
persuasions
democrats
republicans
and
independents
all
view
unions
more
favorably
than
they
did
at
the
low
point
a
decade
or
so
ago
democrats
remain
far
more
likely
than
republicans
to
approve
of
unions
gallup
said
adding
that
those
positive
views
are
double-digits
higher
than
in
yet
for
all
the
upbeat
feeling
associated
with
unions
membership
is
on
a
downward
spiral
falling
by
about
half
over
the
past
years
according
to
a
pew
research
center
fact
sheet
released
on
thursday
to
coincide
with
the
labor
day
weekend
union
membership
peaked
in
at
nearly
of
all
u.s.
workers
excluding
the
self-employed
but
in
the
unionization
rate
was
just
wrote
drew
desilver
at
pew
according
to
figures
complied
by
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
bls
union
membership
dropped
by
to
million
workers
last
year
little
change
from
by
comparison
however
union
membership
rate
was
in
the
first
year
for
which
the
bls
has
comparable
figures
and
there
were
million
union
workers
what's
more
the
bls
reported
that
a
persistently
stubborn
wage
gap
separates
some
groups
of
workers
from
their
colleagues
for
example
women
are
paid
just
cents
for
every
dollar
men
are
paid
white
males
have
a
higher
median
hourly
wage
than
every
other
racial
ethnic
or
gender
subgroup
except
asian
men
the
wage
gap
between
young
workers
with
college
degrees
and
their
less-educated
counterparts
is
the
widest
in
decades
the
bls
reported
noting
that
despite
the
high
cost
of
college
attendance
young
college
graduates
fare
better
than
young
people
with
only
a
high
school
degree
or
less
specifically
the
bureau
found
that
in
the
july
survey
period
only
of
adults
with
a
bachelor's
degree
or
higher
were
unemployed
compared
to
for
adults
with
only
a
high
school
diploma
and
for
adults
who
didn't
graduate
from
high
school
while
unemployment
among
all
groups
has
fallen
since
the
depths
of
the
great
recession
to
levels
not
seen
since
the
s
it's
still
true
that
the
higher
someone's
educational
attainment
is
the
more
likely
they
are
to
have
a
job
all
this
job-related
data
tends
to
take
a
backseat
to
other
holiday
weekend
news
that
serves
as
another
indicator
of
the
nation's
economy
labor
day
sales
it's
only
true
of
course
if
one
is
well
employed
enough
to
take
advantage
of
retailers
mark-downs
but
as
usa
today
reported
recently
the
glorious
long
weekend
also
happens
to
be
a
fantastic
shopping
holiday
