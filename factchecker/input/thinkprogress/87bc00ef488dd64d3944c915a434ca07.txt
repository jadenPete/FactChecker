the
us
hopes
to
end
the
war
in
afghanistan
but
never
considered
what
to
do
about
isis
there
isis
also
known
as
daesh
claimed
responsibility
for
a
wedding
bombing
that
killed
more
than
people
this
weekend
kabul
afghanistan
this
week
was
supposed
to
have
been
one
of
celebration
in
afghanistan
as
this
nation
of
million
people
marks
the
centennial
of
its
independence
from
british
rule
but
tragedy
struck
just
two
days
before
anniversary
observances
a
suicide
bomber
allegedly
a
member
of
the
islamic
state
group
detonated
a
vest
loaded
with
explosives
in
the
middle
of
a
wedding
attended
by
more
than
people
on
saturday
even
in
this
city
plagued
by
years
of
violence
the
attack
in
western
kabul
was
a
horrific
event
claiming
the
lives
of
at
least
people
and
injuring
hundreds
more
as
often
is
the
case
with
terror
attacks
the
bombing
struck
fear
in
citizens
across
afghanistan's
capital
city
ever
since
suicide
bombings
started
here
i
always
feared
that
a
wedding
would
be
targeted
said
parwin
popal
a
kabul
resident
whenever
i
would
go
to
weddings
i
would
think
now
they're
coming
grief
and
disbelief
were
redoubled
on
monday
when
several
bombs
went
off
at
restaurants
and
in
public
squares
throughout
the
city
of
jalalabad
in
eastern
afghanistan
that
series
of
independence
day
attacks
injured
dozens
of
people
including
young
children
no
one
immediately
claimed
responsibility
for
the
bombings
since
the
trump
administration
first
began
face-to-face
talks
with
the
taliban
in
doha
there
have
been
questions
about
what
to
do
with
fighters
claiming
allegiance
to
the
so-called
islamic
state
group
naibiullah
baz
a
parliamentarian
from
the
eastern
province
of
nangarhar
says
dealing
with
the
islamic
state
also
known
as
daesh
may
prove
much
more
difficult
than
the
taliban
the
attack
on
the
wedding
hall
falls
exactly
in
line
with
the
daesh
motive
which
is
much
more
concerned
with
sectarianism
than
politics
he
said
the
difference
between
the
groups
is
that
the
taliban
have
a
political
claim
they
say
that
they
were
a
government
that
was
overthrown
from
power
in
the
weeks
leading
up
to
independence
day
extra
security
precautions
had
been
taken
festivities
would
have
seen
the
reopening
of
a
th
century
palace
destroyed
by
years
of
war
but
the
wedding
hall
bombing
took
the
violence
to
an
unimaginable
new
level
prompting
officials
to
cancel
those
events
they
were
told
if
you
have
your
celebration
we
will
bring
the
shoes
of
every
person
killed
or
wounded
in
the
attack
to
your
palace
said
one
official
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
afghanistan
has
been
expecting
news
in
recent
days
about
an
impending
peace
deal
with
the
united
states
the
taliban
and
washington
are
said
to
be
finalizing
an
agreement
to
end
the
united
states
year
incursion
in
the
country
u.s.
president
donald
trump
alluded
to
a
possible
impending
agreement
in
a
tweet
sent
the
same
day
as
the
horrific
attack
just
completed
a
very
good
meeting
on
afghanistan
many
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
year
war
and
us
are
looking
to
make
a
deal
if
possible
zalmay
khalilzad
washington's
chief
negotiator
with
the
taliban
tweeted
that
the
attack
should
prompt
officials
to
accelerate
their
talks
we
must
accelerate
the
afghanpeaceprocess
including
intra-afghan
negotiations
success
here
will
put
afghans
in
a
much
stronger
position
to
defeat
isis
nasrat
rahimi
spokesman
for
the
interior
ministry
said
saturday's
bombing
served
a
brutal
purpose
the
enemies
of
the
afghanistan
want
to
incite
fear
in
the
afghan
people
by
showing
their
barbarism
he
said
with
that
in
mind
rahimi
said
the
interior
ministry
has
instructed
its
forces
to
take
even
more
precautions
during
upcoming
holy
days
president
ashraf
ghani
meanwhile
pinned
some
of
the
responsibility
for
the
attack
at
least
indirectly
on
the
taliban
the
taliban
cannot
absolve
themselves
of
blame
for
they
provide
platform
for
terrorists
he
said
for
its
part
the
taliban
was
quick
to
denounce
the
massacre
saying
there
is
no
justification
for
such
deliberate
and
brutal
killings
and
targeting
of
women
and
children
however
the
group
continues
to
stage
their
own
attacks
that
are
taking
a
mounting
toll
on
civilian
life
baz
said
this
has
made
discussions
with
the
taliban
possible
since
they
were
able
to
designate
elders
and
ex-officials
that
they
claim
speaks
for
the
entire
movement
he
also
pointed
to
a
demographic
difference
between
isis
and
the
taliban
groups
when
you
see
people
who
claim
to
be
part
of
daesh
they
are
young
boys
from
the
universities
and
the
high
schools
the
taliban
also
are
more
likely
to
be
students
of
religious
schools
many
of
which
are
located
in
territories
disputed
between
afghanistan
and
pakistan
this
he
said
makes
the
daesh
members
much
more
ideological
than
the
taliban
and
even
more
extremist
this
story
has
been
updated
to
correct
the
spelling
of
nabiullah
baz's
name
