black

are
getting

an
epidemic

mowed
down
an
unthinkable
number
of
black
children
in
st
louis
officials
investigating
the
deaths
have
been
powerless
to
stop
the
killing
and
are
reported
to
have
few
leads
in
april
a
two-year-old

the
amount
of
bloodshed
has
been
high
even
for
st
louis
a
city
known
for
appallingly
high
levels
of
gun
violence
last
year
the
city
saw
four
killings
involving
children
or
younger
a
fraction
of
this
year's
horrific
tally
st
louis
mayor
lydia
krewson
has
offered
rewards
totaling
in
at
least
four
of
the
fatal
shootings
only
one
case
has
been
solved
so
far
however
a
man
came
forward
saying
he
fired
the
gun
that
led
to
the
death
of
xavier
usanga
by
any
measure
gun
laws
in
missouri
are
lax
adults
or
older
are
free
to
openly
carry
a
firearm
without
a
permit
and
without
proof
of
training
background
checks
and
proper
registration
aren't
required
for
private
sales
the
staggering
death
toll
sadly
isn't
unique
to
st
louis
while
the
city
since
has
been
ranked
as
the
deadliest
in
america
another
missouri
city
kansas
city
is
not
far
behind
missouri's
largest
city
with
a
population
of
half
a
million
people
kansas
city
has
recorded
nearly
homicides
so
far
this
year
and
about
of
the
victims
were
black
but
st
louis
easily
surpasses
kansas
city
in
terms
of
its
woeful
body
count
as
of
thursday
st
louis
had
recorded
homicides
so
far
this
year
if
the
pattern
holds
the
city
will
top
last
year's
murder
total
of
and
in
a
city
where
about
half
of
the
residents
are
black
of
those
murder
victims
in
st
louis
were
black
meanwhile
black
lawmakers
have
been
pleading
with
missouri's
republican
governor
mike
parson
to
consider
legislation
that
would
allow
cities
to
enact
their
own
gun
control
laws
so
that
they
can
better
respond
to
the
crisis
the
violence
led
state
rep
ashley
bland
manlove
a
democrat
to
declare
that
a
public
health
crisis
now
exists
as
a
result
of
a
bloodletting
that
has
ended
an
unspeakable
number
of
young
lives
before
they've
even
begun
