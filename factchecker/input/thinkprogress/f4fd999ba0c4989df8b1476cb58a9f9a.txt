million

nobody

country
president
donald
trump's
latest
attack
on
working
families
will
hit
especially
hard
in
the
states
that
voted
for
him
more
than
half
of
the
people
who
are
set
to
lose
access
to
food

under
regulations
proposed
this
summer
live
in
states
that
went
for
trump
in
one
in
every
twelve
people
who
receives
food
stamps
nationwide
will
lose
them
under
the
policy
some
million
people
according
to
new
analysis
by
mathematica
the
private
policy
analysis
firm
the
department
of
agriculture
usda
has
relied
upon
for
the
past
years
i
was
surprised
by
the
extent
of
the
impact
in
some
of
the
southern
states
such
as
texas
mathematica
senior
research
programmer
sarah
lauffer
said
the
impact
was
always
going
to
be
severe
in
states
that
apply
the
current
rules
in
the
most
generous
fashion
but
southern
states
have
generally
not
extended
their
eligibility
lines
quite
as
far
despite
that
lauffer
said
her
team
found
of
elderly
texans
receiving
benefits
will
lose
them
through
this
rule
almost
people
in
texas
currently
receiving
supplemental
nutrition
assistance
program

benefits
would
lose
them
another

in

and
in

face
cuts
to
name
just
a
few
standouts
almost
one
in
five
wisconsin
households
currently
getting
help
with
their
groceries
will
lose
the
benefit
as
well
as
of
such
households
in
oregon
nevada
iowa
and
delaware
two
of
every
snap
households
in
minnesota
and
texas
will
have
to
find
food
money
elsewhere
the
administration
plans
to
slash
benefits
by
ending
a
popular
bipartisan
policy
known
as
broad-based
categorical
eligibility
bbce
that
policy
protects
low-wage
workers
from
a
quirk
of
poverty-assistance
law
known
as
the
benefits
cliff
whereby
earning
or
saving
slightly
too
much
money
can
trigger
a
low-income
family's
eviction
from
public
assistance
programs
ending
the
expanded
eligibility
system
for
snap
will
also
boot
roughly
half
a
million
kids
out
of
free
school
meal
programs
nationwide
the
administration
has
insisted
those
kids
could
all
hop
right
back
in
by
filling
out
application
forms
currently
mooted
by
the
bbce
system
but
experts
have
warned
it
doesn't
necessarily
work
that
way
the
administration
forecasts
a
billion
total
draw-down
in
snap
spending
over
the
next
five
years
once
the
policy
is
enacted
it
didn't
estimate
the
long-term
costs
of
making
families
hungrier
and
more
desperate
allowing
families
whose
gross
income
is
a
little
over
the
poverty
level
to
receive
food
assistance
helps
make
sure
that
both
the
kids
and
adults
in
the
family
are
able
to
eat
said
lisa
davis
senior
vice
president
at
the
poverty
policy
center
no
kid
hungry
children
that
don't
get
the
nutrition
that
they
need
end
up
with
worse
health-care
outcomes
worse
physical
and
cognitive
development
they
have
poorer

in

they
find
it
harder
to
concentrate
they
don't
do
as
well
on

there
are
more

the

has
always
known
it
would
be
yanking
food

away
from
millions

when
they

the
new

in

it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
us
food
research
action
center's
ellen
vollinger
said
taking
food
away
from
people
is
just
going
to
make
their
food
security
situation
worse
make
them
hungrier
it
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
economy
at
a
time
when
some
economists
are
warning
us
we
would
be
in
for
another
downturn
non-profit
groups
across
the
country
are
dutifully
filing
public
comments
criticizing
the
rule
and
pointing
out
all
the
ways
the
usda
appears
to
have
ignored
evidence
congressional
intent
and
practical
facts
in
issuing
its
proposal
the
day
window
for
such
comments
closes
later
in
the
fall
and
the
administration
will
likely
face
legal
challenges
if
it
attempts
to
handle
the
objections
with
a
pro-forma
sweep
of
the
hand
but
usda
secretary
sonny
perdue
has
been
determined
to
kill
bbce
for
months
ever
since
congress
decided
to
retain
the
policy
in
last
year's
farm
bill
there's
a
strong
chance
the
cut
in
some
form
will
have
kicked
in
by
this
time
next
year
these
families
earn
a
little
more
than
the
statutory
maximum
income
for
snap
eligibility
but
that
doesn't
mean
they
can
afford
to
see
even
the
modest
food
assistance
they
currently
receive
disappear
from
their
monthly
budgets
they're
making
trade-offs
between
what
bills
to
pay
do
they
pay
the
rent
or
get
a
car
fixed
so
they
can
keep
going
to
work
or
keep
the
lights
on
davis
said
we
see
those
families
cut
back
on
food
first
bbce
helps
make
sure
that
both
the
kids
and
adults
in
the
family
are
able
to
eat
as
thursday's
state-level
figures
suggest
the
categorical
eligibility
smackdown
is
going
to
hit
especially
hard
in
four
states
where
very
narrow
trump
wins
in
tilted
the
electoral
college
irrevocably
in
his
favor
trump
won
wisconsin
by
less
than
votes
last
time
he'll
have
dumped
wisconsin
residents
off
of
food
stamps
by
election
day
if
the
rule
goes
through
as
planned
one
in
every
nine
people
currently
benefiting
from
snap
in
michigan
will
be
booted
under
the
rule
roughly
men
women
and
children
in
total
trump
won
the
state
by
just
votes
last
go
round
in
pennsylvania
which
trump
carried
by
just
under
votes
his
food
stamps
cut
will
dump
more
than
five
times
that
many
people
off
the
food-aid
rolls
the
potential
economic
and
electoral
self-sabotage
is
particularly
striking
given
that
bipartisan
majorities
in
congress
have
repeatedly
rejected
this
precise
policy
as
recently
as
last
year
the
right-wing
crusade
against
broad-based
categorical
eligibility
has
never
won
a
majority
of
republican
hearts
and
minds
like
the
vast
majority
of
voters
who
oppose
cutting
food
stamps
the
rump
of
gop
elected
understand
that
bbce
is
an
effective
investment
in
children's
long-term
futures
local
economies
short-term
health
and
working
families
progress
up
the
income
ladder
for
the
most
part
the
attacks
on
snap
in
recent
years
have
not
been
successful
congress
has
decided
not
to
weaken
snap
in
the
farm
bill
rejected
multiple
crazy
assaults
on
it
vollinger
said
we're
hopeful
that
there
will
be
enough
comment
and
insight
brought
to
bear
during
this
comment
period
that
the
administration
would
reconsider
it's
not
just
snap
recipients
who
will
feel
the
impact
the
suffering
the
administration
plans
to
inflict
on
working-poor
families
will
likely
also
be
felt
in
higher-income
households
too
in
the
form
of
a
broader
economic
slowdown
consumer
spending
drives
the
whole
economy
cutting
snap
benefits
means
consumers
have
less
to
spend
usda
staff
issued
updated
estimates
on
the
economic
multiplier
effects
of
snap
spending
earlier
this
summer
though
the
trump
administration
team's
official
guesstimate
is
slightly
lower
than
past
multipliers
the
report
includes
a
variety
of
models
each
additional
dollar
of
snap
benefit
paid
out
generates
between
and
in
total
economic
activity
when
the
economy
is
struggling
their
tables
show
the
agency
also
broke
the
economic
impacts
out
by
sector
with
some
surprising
results
the
trade
and
transportation
industry
takes
the
largest
hit
from
snap
cuts
but
across
nine
major
industrial
sectors
the
agency
analyzed
the
level
of
cuts
to
be
imposed
by
the
new
eligibility
restrictions
stand
to
kill
between
and
jobs
per
year
over
the
next
half-decade
forecasters
who
make
their
livings
predicting
what
the
economy
will
do
next
are
already
starting
to
worry
that
a
nationwide
recession
looms
multiple
states
have
experienced
recessions
within
their
own
borders
in
the
past
two
years
and
at
least
two
appear
to
be
on
the
brink
of
entering
new
contractions
based
on
sudden
jumps
in
local
unemployment
rates
the
national
economy
is
still
growing
but
at
a
slower
pace
over
the
past
two
quarters
than
previously
the
investor
class
is
souring
on
long-term
u.s.
government
bonds
producing
the
dreaded
yet
tediously
named
a
yield-curve
inversion
a
phenomenon
that
does
not
guarantee
a
recession
but
which
has
occurred
prior
to
every
u.s.
recession
in
the
last
half-century
the
country's
manufacturing
sector
had
been
expanding
for
three
straight
years
but
in
august
it
contracted
again
not
a
surefire
sign
of
an
overall
downturn
but
certainly
an
unhealthy
indicator
presidents
almost
always
get
too
much
credit
for
good
economies
and
too
much
blame
for
bad
ones
as
the
financier
and
policy
expert
barry
ritholtz
noted
in
a
recent
column
but
trump
is
doing
more
to
actively
poke
the
markets
in
the
eye
than
your
average
president
and
while
the
economist
and
investor
classes
grow
alarmed
about
the
sorts
of
sophisticated
technical
indicators
that
make
the
business
pages
the
administration
is
also
planning
to
jab
the
working
poor
with
a
sharp
stick
whether
the
snap
cuts
trump
seeks
would
help
tip
the
country
into
a
recession
or
not
they
are
certain
to
make
life
harder
for
people
ill-positioned
to
absorb
such
a
pinch
presidents
seeking
re-election
generally
rise
or
fall
with
the
health
of
the
economy
they're
credited
fairly
or
unfairly
with
creating
