forest
r
came
under
fire
recently
for
comments
first
reported
by
thinkprogress
warning
that
america's
diversity
was
a
huge
threat
to
its
continued
existence
now
a
newly
unearthed
video
makes
clear
that
his
xenophobic
views
are
nothing
new
forest
first
ran
for
lieutenant
governor
in
at
a
raleigh
tea
party
rally
on
tax
day
that
year
he
delivered
a
speech
about
the
supposed
dangers
of
immigration
a
resurfaced
video
of
those
remarks
discovered
by
american
bridge
st
century
a
progressive
research
organization
shows
him
proposing
an
english-only
north

as
a
way
to
scare
off
undocumented
immigrants
we're
also
ranked
nd
in
the
nation
in
illegal

only
eight
states
have
a
worse
problem
with
illegal
immigration
than
we
have
we
have
somewhere
between
and
million
illegal
immigrants
in
north
carolina
it
costs
our
state
nearly
billion
a
year
that's
unsustainable
forest
warned
quoting
a
ridiculous
estimate
pushed
by
anti-immigrant
hate
groups
his
proposals
to
get
rid
of
these
undocumented
immigrants
included
implementing
e-verify
programs
for
employers
funding
g
programs
to
deputize
local
law
enforcement
with
the
authority
to
act
as
federal
immigration
agents
implementing
strict
photo
voter
identification
laws
to
address
the
virtually
non-existent
problem
of

mak
ing
sure
that
we
mandate
english
as
the
official
language
of
north

forest
did
not
respond
to
a
thinkprogress
inquiry
about
whether
he
still
believes
that
non-english
speakers
even
citizens
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
communicate
with
their
government
in
other
languages
but
a
sermon
he
delivered
in
june
conveyed
a
similar
anti-diversity
worldview
n
o
other
nation
my
friends
has
ever
survived
the
diversity
and
multiculturalism
that
america
faces
today
because
of
a
lack
of
assimilation
because
of
this
division
and
because
of
this
identity
