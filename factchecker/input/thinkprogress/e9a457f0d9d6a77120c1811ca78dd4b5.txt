trump's
fox
friends
pals
finally
concede
mexico
ain't
paying
for
that
wall
the
president
never
should
have
said
mexico
was
gonna
pay
for
the
wall
president
donald
trump's
campaign
was
centered
on
one
grand
campaign
promise
he
would
build
a
massive
wall
along
the
entire
southern
border
of
the
nation
and
its
construction
would
be
completely
paid
for
by
mexico
three
years
later
almost
no
construction
has
happened
and
mexico
has
repeatedly
made
it
clear
that
it
will
not
be
paying
a
cent
on
thursday
trump's
dear
friends
on
fox
friends
finally
admitted
what
has
been
obvious
for
years
this
was
an
empty
claim
a
broken
promise
and
a
huge
failure
on
the
part
of
trump
the
show's
famously
pro-trump
hosts
made
the
admission
that
mexico
is
never
paying
for
the
wall
in
a
segment
highlighting
the
administration's
plan
to
unilaterally
divert
billion
in
funds
from
defense
programs
to
begin
major
construction
noting
that
the
wall
was
trump's
most
prominent
campaign
promise
co-host
ainsley
earhardt
observed
that
the
administration
faces
a
choice
between
military
projects
and
building
up
to
miles
of
the
wall
far
less
than
what
trump
promised
to
build
as
a
candidate
co-host
brian
kilmeade
slammed
sensationalist
headlines
but
when
addressing
one
noting
that
trump's
new
plan
lets
mexico
off
the
hook
for
paying
he
conceded
he's
right
the
president
never
should
have
said
mexico
was
gonna
pay
for
the
wall
co-host
steve
doocy
then
attempted
to
defend
trump
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
president
thought
he
would
get
mexico
to
pay
for
the
wall
but
was
just
mistaken
i
think
he
thought
he
would
find
a
way
for
mexico
to
pay
for
it
but
as
we
know
that
did
not
work
earhardt
then
noted
that
the
money
for
trump's
wall
would
now
come
from
money
that
would
have
gone
to
things
including
a
middle
school
at
fort
campbell
child
development
centers
at
joint
base
andrews
and
a
fire
station
in
beaufort
south
carolina
doocy
then
suggested
that
if
congress
decides
to
appropriate
more
money
to
go
to
those
previously
funded
and
now
raided
programs
they
could
save
the
projects
in
other
words
rather
than
cut
spending
the
co-host
thinks
the
solution
is
for
them
to
appropriate
the
same
billion
to
the
same
programs
twice
in
february
trump
said
that
mexico
would
be
very
happy
about
paying
for
the
wall
i'll
talk
to
them
they're
going
to
be
thrilled
to
be
paying
for
the
wall
we're
going
to
be
the
smart
people
we're
not
going
to
be
the
people
that
get
pushed
around
all
over
the
place
we're
going
to
be
the
smart
people
in
april
trump
vowed
the
wall
would
be
done
by
now
i
would
say
it'll
be
complete
within
two
years
from
the
time
we
start
we'll
start
quickly
we'll
start
quickly
and
it'll
be
a
real
wall
it'll
be
a
real
wall
on
another
occasion
he
said
we'll
build
a
wall
i
promise
i
promise
we
will
build
a
wall
if
there's
ever
a
second
term
you'll
say
man
he
got
that
wall
built
fast
we're
going
to
put
him
up
so
we'll
see
we'll
build
the
wall
though
little
to
no
progress
has
been
made
in
building
a
new
wall
over
the
first
three
years
of
trump's
administration
he
has
repeatedly
lied
claiming
it
was
already
well
underway
