trump
skips
g
climate
meeting
as
the
amazon
burns
at
the
g
climate
change
takes
a
backseat
for
trump
leaders
representing
the
world's
seven
biggest
economies
struck
a
deal
on
monday
to
bring
badly
needed
aid
to
the
fire-stricken
amazon
following
global
uproar
over
the
growing
threat
to
the
critical
natural
resource
but
the
announcement
will
likely
do
little
to
fix
a
deep
divide
on
climate
issues
between
several
world
powers
while
european
leaders
have
expressed
ongoing
concern
about
the
amazon's
fires
brazilian
president
jair
bolsonaro's
right-wing
government
has
empowered
the
business
interests
linked
to
the
fires
prioritizing
agriculture
over
the
environment
and
bolsonaro
has
an
ally
in
president
donald
trump
who
himself
missed
a
g
climate
change
meeting
earlier
in
the
day
citing
scheduled
meetings
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
monday
that
g
powers
would
commit
million
to
assist
brazil
and
its
neighbors
in
their
efforts
to
protect
the
amazon
that
group
consisting
of
france
canada
the
united
kingdom
italy
japan
germany
and
the
united
states
meets
annually
to
discuss
global
economics
and
policy
macron
said
that
the
initiative
had
u.s.
support
but
noted
that
trump
missed
monday
morning's
climate
meeting
the
meeting
focused
on
biodiversity
and
oceans
as
well
as
climate
issues
in
general
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
told
reporters
that
trump
had
previously
scheduled
commitments
and
that
a
senior
member
of
the
administration
attended
in
his
stead
the
million
commitment
marks
a
victory
for
macron
who
has
fought
to
make
the
wildfires
a
central
issue
at
the
summit
in
biarritz
france
but
it
is
unclear
what
impact
the
aid
will
have
given
the
scope
of
the
problem
brazil
has
seen
more
than
fires
this
year
according
to
the
country's
national
institute
for
space
research
with
in
the
amazon
wildfires
are
a
naturally
occurring
phenomenon
that
scientists
say
are
growing
more
common
and
more
devastating
as
global
temperatures
increase
but
the
amazon's
fires
are
not
an
act
of
nature
gone
awry
instead
the
blaze
was
caused
by
intentional
efforts
to
clear
the
land
for
ranching
and
farming
efforts
that
have
spiraled
out
of
hand
now
the
world
is
facing
a
staggering
problem
the
amazon
referred
to
by
some
as
the
world's
lungs
is
a
crucial
carbon
sink
and
provides
of
global
oxygen
without
it
fighting
climate
change
will
be
much
harder
and
that's
to
say
nothing
of
the
blow
to
biodiversity
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
along
with
the
overall
cost
to
humanity
some
three
million
species
of
plants
and
animals
are
found
in
the
amazon
where
around
one
million
indigenous
people
also
live
macron
called
the
situation
an
international
crisis
and
has
taken
aim
at
brazil's
leadership
over
the
fires
this
political
dynamic
has
underscored
tense
g
talks
when
he
took
office
in
january
bolsonaro
almost
immediately
made
good
on
his
campaign
promises
to
support
agricultural
and
mining
businesses
in
the
amazon
at
the
expense
of
the
environment
and
indigenous
communities
while
the
fires
have
sparked
international
concern
bolsonaro
has
downplayed
the
situation
and
accused
his
political
foes
of
sabotage
on
the
question
of
burning
in
the
amazon
which
in
my
opinion
may
have
been
initiated
by
ngos
because
they
lost
money
what
is
the
intention
to
bring
problems
to
brazil
the
president
said
earlier
this
month
a
claim
for
which
he
later
admitted
he
had
no
evidence
but
bolsonaro
has
risen
to
power
largely
by
positioning
himself
in
contrast
to
western
leaders
a
distinction
he
has
driven
home
as
the
fires
have
worsened
bolsonaro
recently
accused
macron
and
the
g
of
interfering
in
brazil's
affairs
and
having
a
misplaced
colonialist
mindset
this
came
after
macron
called
for
g
leaders
to
prioritize
the
issue
during
the
current
summit
our
house
is
burning
literally
the
amazon
rain
forest
the
lungs
which
produces
of
our
planet's
oxygen
is
on
fire
the
french
leader
wrote
in
a
tweet
last
week
on
sunday
however
the
brazilian
leader
bowed
to
growing
international
pressure
and
authorized
the
military
to
combat
the
flames
on
the
sidelines
of
the
dispute
meanwhile
is
the
united
states
like
brazil
the
united
states
has
taken
an
increasing
backseat
on
global
climate
leadership
under
trump
the
united
states
is
set
to
exit
the
paris
climate
agreement
next
year
while
bolstering
support
for
fossil
fuels
and
slashing
environmental
protections
trump
has
also
maintained
friendly
ties
with
bolsonaro
and
has
largely
supported
his
brazilian
counterpart
as
the
amazonian
fires
have
worsened
last
week
the
u.s.
president
tweeted
about
an
exchange
with
bolsonaro
and
offered
brazil
his
support
i
told
him
if
the
united
states
can
help
with
the
amazon
rainforest
fires
we
stand
ready
to
assist
trump
wrote
trump's
absence
at
the
g
climate
meeting
however
further
highlights
the
gap
between
the
united
states
and
many
of
its
allies
as
does
the
president's
rapport
with
bolsonaro
this
contrast
is
only
set
to
deepen
as
climate
action
becomes
a
bigger
priority
for
many
world
leaders
u.n.
secretary-general
antonio
guterres
warned
monday
that
the
world
is
facing
a
dramatic
climate
emergency
and
in
a
seeming
nod
to
the
united
states
guterres
also
emphasized
that
smaller
actors
like
cities
and
states
have
the
capacity
to
deliver
in
relation
to
climate
action
