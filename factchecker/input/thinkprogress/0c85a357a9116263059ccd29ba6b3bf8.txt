fifa
is
already
setting
up
the
women's
world
cup
for
failure
while
fifa
brags
about
the
unprecedented
growth
in
women's
soccer
it
also
does
its
best
to
slow
it
down
less
than
two
months
removed
from
the
most-watched
women's
world
cup
ever
fifa
the
governing
body
of
soccer
is
once
again
showing
how
little
it
cares
about
the
women's
game
on
monday
fifa
announced
that
belgium
had
showcased
a
desire
to
host
the
women's
world
cup
which
made
them
the
th
country
to
express
interest
in
submitting
a
bid
a
number
fifa
excitedly
referred
to
as
unprecedented
on
the
surface
that
sounds
phenomenal
after
all
there
were
only
two
official
bids
for
the
women's
world
cup
but
it
quickly
became
clear
that
while
yes
the
women's
game
is
growing
fifa
is
still
doing
its
best
to
halt
that
growth
on
monday
fifa
published
its
press
release
leading
with
belgium's
interest
in
hosting
the
women's
world
cup
in
but
just
hours
later
belgium
came
forward
and
said
there
had
been
a
miscommunication
they
had
no
plans
to
enter
an
official
bid
according
to
the
new
york
times
one
would
think
that
fifa
would
have
checked
in
with
belgium
before
announcing
such
a
thing
but
then
again
it
is
fifa
but
that's
not
the
only
problem
the
new
timeline
for
bid
submissions
was
provided
too
and
goodness
is
the
schedule
alarming
the
nine
countries
that
have
expressed
interest
in
hosting
the
event
australia
japan
south
korea
new
zealand
argentina
bolivia
brazil
colombia
and
south
africa
have
until
september
to
confirm
their
intention
to
bid
and
all
completed
bids
must
be
submitted
by
december
the
host
nation
will
be
voted
on
in
may
this
means
that
the
host
nation
selected
will
have
just
over
three
years
to
prepare
to
host
the
women's
world
cup
in
contrast
the
men's
world
cup
was
awarded
to
the
joint
bid
presented
by
the
united
states
canada
and
mexico
in
giving
the
north
americans
eight
years
to
prepare
for
the
mega
event
and
fifa
told
qatar
it
was
hosting
the
men's
world
cup
way
back
in
giving
it
years
to
prepare
there
are
many
many
things
to
criticize
about
the
qatar
bid
it's
just
notable
that
preparation
time
was
not
an
issue
even
past
hosts
of
the
women's
world
cup
have
gotten
more
advance
notice
france
and
canada
both
were
given
more
than
four
years
of
lead
time
and
for
france
that
didn't
seem
to
be
enough
as
cassidy
gabriel
wrote
in
sb
nations's
women's
soccer
vertical
all
for
xi
the
tournament
in
france
this
summer
often
felt
slapped
together
game
after
game
host
cities
seemed
unprepared
for
the
size
and
scale
of
the
world
cup
gabriel
wrote
food
and
water
ran
low
in
stadiums
amidst
a
record-breaking
european
heatwave
hotels
cancelled
and
public
transportation
systems
closed
before
matches
ended
forcing
some
fans
to
leave
their
seats
in
the
middle
of
play
to
catch
trains
and
leaving
others
stranded
outside
of
stadiums
into
the
wee
hours
of
the
morning
these
may
seem
like
minor
things
but
they're
a
huge
part
of
the
logistical
concerns
that
cities
and
countries
need
to
begin
preparing
for
years
in
advance
and
that's
in
addition
to
building
or
re-purposing
stadiums
and
making
sure
that
the
teams
have
the
proper
training
facilities
and
accommodations
one
would
think
after
its
failures
in
france
fifa
would
realize
the
importance
of
preparation
time
however
there
was
no
way
for
them
to
give
the
next
host
nation
an
advance
warning
because
unlike
previous
years
fifa
went
into
this
women's
world
cup
without
a
set
host
for
then
it
complicated
things
even
further
when
it
announced
on
july
that
the
field
for
the
tournament
was
going
to
expand
from
teams
to
teams
fifa
boasted
about
the
global
impact
this
would
have
on
women's
soccer
the
expansion
reaches
far
beyond
the
eight
additional
participating
teams
fifa
president
gianni
infantino
said
it
means
that
from
now
on
dozens
more
member
associations
will
organize
their
women's
football
program
knowing
they
have
a
realistic
chance
of
qualifying
again
on
the
surface
this
is
good
news
however
because
of
that
announcement
fifa
reopened
the
bidding
process
and
pushed
back
the
timeline
so
that
prospective
host
cities
could
adjust
their
bids
to
include
eight
more
teams
now
they
only
have
a
few
months
to
alter
their
bids
and
the
selected
nation
will
only
have
three
years
to
prepare
for
the
largest
women's
world
cup
ever
fifa
knows
that
it
takes
time
to
make
such
changes
because
it
provides
that
time
to
the
men's
game
it
announced
that
the
men's
team
would
be
expanded
from
to
teams
back
in
january
of
however
that
change
wasn't
slated
to
go
into
effect
until
the
world
cup
this
gave
potential
host
cities
more
than
a
year
to
adjust
their
bids
to
include
the
expansion
and
it
gave
everyone
in
the
game
nine
years
to
ready
itself
for
the
shift
the
women's
game
deserves
that
much
forethought
faith
and
care
but
fifa
has
shown
once
again
that
it
is
unwilling
to
provide
it
