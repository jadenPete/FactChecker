experts
endorse
cory
booker's
explanation
for
trump
winning
michigan
election
experts
say
the
candidate
is
onto
something
sen
cory
booker
d-nj
claimed
during
wednesday
night's
presidential
debate
that
president
donald
trump
won
michigan
in
because
republicans
and
russians
worked
to
suppress
the
votes
of
african
americans
election
experts
say
he's
onto
something
we
lost
the
state
of
michigan
because
everybody
from
republicans
to
russians
were
targeting
the
suppression
of
african
american
voters
we
need
to
say
that
booker
said
during
the
second
night
of
the
second
set
of
debates
in
detroit
if
the
african
american
vote
was
four
years
earlier
we
would
have
won
the
state
of
michigan
he
continued
we
need
to
have
a
campaign
that
is
ready
for
what's
coming
an
assault
especially
on
the
highest-performing
voter
group
in
our
coalition
which
is
black
women
trump
won
the
state
by
votes
reports
from
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
and
the
senate
intelligence
committee
outlined
how
a
troll
farm
called
the
internet
research
agency
which
has
close
ties
to
the
kremlin
made
a
coordinated
effort
on
social
media
to
suppress
the
black
vote
in
african
americans
tend
to
vote
overwhelmingly
for
democrats
there
is
reason
to
believe
those
russian
efforts
worked
a
new
study
from
researchers
at
the
university
of
tennessee
found
that
social
media
posts
and
disinformation
spread
by
russian
troll
farms
influenced
how
americans
responded
to
opinion
polls
before
the
election
michigan
voters
were
also
hampered
that
year
by
republican
legislative
maneuvers
to
suppress
minority
turnout
last
november
michigan
voters
passed
sweeping
voting
rights
laws
that
make
it
possible
to
vote
absentee
without
providing
a
reason
allow
people
to
register
to
vote
on
election
day
and
allow
residents
to
automatically
enroll
to
vote
at
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
however
those
laws
were
not
in
place
in
when
turnout
was
low
among
college
students
african
american
and
latinx
voters
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
according
to
sharon
dolente
a
voting
rights
strategist
for
the
aclu
of
michigan
michigan's
entire
system
of
voting
was
so
arcane
during
that
it
suppressed
a
number
of
voters
dolente
said
most
of
the
changes
we
have
now
made
would
have
significantly
increased
turnout
beyond
the
margins
in
i
don't
know
how
they
would
have
voted
but
it
would
have
been
more
than
voters
so
the
outcome
could
have
been
different
democratic
lawmakers
introduced
a
number
of
bills
that
would
have
allowed
no-reason
absentee
ballot
voting
before
the
election
however
republicans
who
took
control
of
the
state's
house
senate
and
governor's
office
over
an
eight-year
period
starting
in
thanks
in
part
to
gerrymandering
blocked
those
bills
from
passing
republicans
argued
that
any
reform
must
include
a
restrictive
in-person
voter
id
requirement
voter
id
mandates
have
traditionally
been
a
pet
cause
of
republican
lawmakers
who
have
at
times
acknowledged
that
such
laws
would
give
them
an
edge
at
the
ballot
box
democratic
legislators
also
introduced
several
same-day
voter
registration
bills
in
and
but
those
efforts
all
died
in
the
state's
house
a
study
by
the
center
for
american
progress
found
that
when
states
implement
same-day
voter
registration
voter
participation
increases
on
average
by
same-day
voter
registration
laws
particularly
impact
populations
that
have
historically
been
underrepresented
in
the
political
system
including
young
people
and
people
of
color
the
study
found
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
news
site
housed
at
the
center
for
american
progress
action
fund
before
november
michigan
was
one
of
more
than
states
that
had
not
adopted
same-day
voter
registration
its
implementation
was
projected
to
increase
voter
turnout
in
michigan
by
more
than
according
to
the
center
for
american
progress
study
there
are
also
lingering
questions
about
whether
the
votes
of
many
black
michiganders
were
actually
counted
in
on
election
day
more
than
voting
machines
in
detroit
malfunctioned
raising
questions
about
the
accuracy
of
election
results
in
of
the
majority-black
city's
precincts
the
ballot-box
failure
itself
was
caused
by
the
severe
underfunding
of
america's
election
system
said
myrna
p
rez
director
of
the
voting
rights
and
elections
program
at
the
brennan
center
for
justice
a
shortage
of
poll
workers
and
voting
machines
prompts
long
voting
lines
and
longer
waits
at
precincts
in
minority
communities
due
to
those
shortages
elections
officials
often
don't
recognize
issues
with
polling
machines
until
election
day
dolente
said
also
some
michigan
poll
workers
incorrectly
told
voters
that
they
needed
to
show
identification
to
vote
according
to
another
study
by
the
center
for
american
progress
it
is
unclear
how
many
people
lost
their
opportunity
to
vote
as
a
result
in
addition
just
weeks
before
the
election
trump
urged
his
supporters
to
monitor
polling
places
to
ensure
that
voter
fraud
and
election
rigging
did
not
occur
dolente
said
that
while
she
defends
poll-watching
she
and
other
election
advocates
feared
trump's
comments
would
stir
up
violence
there
was
a
concern
of
heightened
violence
at
the
polls
i
think
that
also
could
have
been
a
very
suppressing
impact
on
people
of
color
dolente
said
that
is
voter
suppression
the
extent
of
the
suppression
isn't
entirely
clear
but
experts
believe
it
had
some
impact
it's
really
hard
to
say
whether
things
like
this
affect
the
outcome
of
any
given
election
said
jonathan
diaz
legal
counsel
at
the
campaign
legal
center
a
voting-rights
group
but
sen
booker
is
certainly
correct
that
voter
suppression
played
a
role
in
the
presidential
election
