federal
funding
needed
to
thwart
attacks
on
elections
state
officials
say
it's
time
we
put
some
dollars
behind
what's
happening
said
connecticut's
secretary
of
state
state
election
officials
are
sounding
what
is
becoming
an
increasingly
dire
warning
about
the
integrity
of
the
voting
process
heading
into
the
election
pleading
for
federal
funds
to
help
secure
next
year's
balloting
against
cyberattacks
at
a
public
forum
on
thursday
the
top
election
officials
from
connecticut
and
louisiana
said
underfunded
election
systems
in
their
states
are
vulnerable
to
hacking
from
outside
agents
who
might
want
to
create
mischief
or
even
seek
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
vote
we
all
have
the
same
expectation
which
is
a
secure
environment
for
our
elections
and
that
every
vote
is
accurately
counted
and
everybody
gets
to
participate
who
wishes
to
participate
kyle
ardoin
louisiana's
secretary
of
state
said
at
a
forum
hosted
by
the
election
assistance
commission
state
officials
ardoin
said
are
constantly
asking
for
additional
resources
to
fend
off
cybersecurity
issues
to
update
equipment
and
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
secure
our
elections
and
offer
our
people
the
right
to
vote
denise
merrill
the
secretary
of
state
for
connecticut
underscored
the
threat
to
elections
there
pleading
for
additional
federal
funding
to
secure
the
vote
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
operations
of
government
you're
not
going
to
privatize
elections
and
so
it's
time
we
put
some
dollars
behind
what's
happening
merrill
told
the
forum
sponsored
by
the
commission
an
independent
agency
of
the
united
states
government
which
serves
as
a
national
clearinghouse
and
resource
of
information
on
administering
elections
i
do
think
some
funding
needs
to
come
from
the
federal
level
merrill
said
their
pleas
came
just
two
days
after
president
donald
trump
tweeted
that
he
was
open
to
shoring
up
election
security
but
only
if
congress
agreed
to
put
voter
id
laws
supported
by
republicans
into
place
such
laws
historically
have
been
used
to
block
access
to
the
ballot
box
to
people
of
color
students
and
other
groups
that
tend
to
lean
democratic
no
debate
on
election
security
should
go
forward
without
first
agreeing
that
voter
id
identification
must
play
a
very
strong
part
in
any
final
agreement
without
voter
id
it
is
all
so
meaningless
trump
tweeted
late
tuesday
there
is
little
debate
surrounding
the
need
to
prevent
hostile
foreign
countries
like
russia
from
hacking
into
outdated
paperless
ballot
boxes
during
the
election
such
attacks
occurred
during
the
election
and
it
will
happen
again
in
according
to
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
two-year
investigation
and
the
country's
entire
intelligence
apparatus
although
election
security
continues
to
be
the
focus
of
concern
by
some
officials
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
the
aftermath
of
efforts
by
russia
to
hack
into
u.s.
voting
systems
steps
taken
to
try
to
fix
the
problem
have
been
modest
at
best
on
thursday
a
federal
judge
citing
security
concerns
ordered
election
officials
in
abrams
home
state
to
stop
using
paperless
touch
screen
voting
machines
ahead
of
the
election
in
her
page
ruling
u.s.
district
judge
amy
totenberg
said
that
hand-marked
paper
ballots
must
be
used
if
a
new
system
isn't
in
place
by
next
year's
presidential
primaries
election
integrity
advocates
had
argued
in
a
lawsuit
that
paperless
touch
screen
voting
machines
in
use
since
were
vulnerable
to
hacking
and
could
not
be
audited
meanwhile
democrats
are
also
concerned
about
the
effects
of
gerrymandering
and
other
efforts
to
discourage
voter
participation
moves
that
disproportionately
impact
their
voters
the
same
day
that
trump
tweeted
his
refusal
to
shore
election
security
unless
officials
clamp
down
harder
on
voter
id
laws
former
georgia
democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
stacey
abrams
announced
she
was
launching
fair
fight
an
initiative
to
help
enfranchise
voters
in
a
number
of
key
swing
states
even
helping
shore
up
voting
systems
from
hacking
can't
protect
the
ballot
from
intentional
manipulation
of
the
vote
with
republicans
doubling
down
on
gerrymandering
and
other
untoward
actions
that
have
helped
them
eke
out
wins
in
close
elections
democrats
like
abrams
say
they
believe
that
by
allowing
as
many
eligible
voters
to
cast
a
ballot
as
possible
they
will
win
elections
republicans
meanwhile
have
been
imposing
burdensome
laws
and
regulations
that
are
designed
to
stop
likely
democratic
voters
including
college
students
and
african
and
latinx
americans
from
casting
ballots
it
would
cost
an
estimated
million
to
replace
electronic
voter
machines
throughout
the
country
and
protect
america's
elections
from
online
attacks
russia
which
meddled
in
the
election
to
swing
the
results
in
trump's
favor
targeted
election
systems
in
all
states
during
the
election
according
to
a
senate
intelligence
committee
report
however
trump
has
indicated
that
he
would
be
willing
to
accept
help
from
foreign
adversaries
to
win
the
presidential
election
and
last
month
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
blocked
an
election
security
bill
that
would
have
helped
stop
the
hacking
threat
a
number
of
reports
and
studies
have
confirmed
that
documented
cases
of
voter
fraud
are
astronomically
rare
a
washington
post
investigation
found
that
out
of
over
billion
ballots
cast
there
were
only
credible
cases
of
impersonation
fraud
between
and
republicans
who
insist
that
voter
fraud
rather
than
election
security
is
the
real
issue
go
to
great
lengths
to
prove
it
such
as
establishing
a
dubious
and
now
disbanded
voter
fraud
commission
that
is
because
voter
fraud
is
their
excuse
for
imposing
their
voter
suppression
laws
that
place
barriers
on
likely
democratic
voters
a
number
of
republican-controlled
states
began
imposing
voter
id
laws
in
based
on
model
legislation
crafted
by
a
secretive
and
powerful
far-right
organization
the
american
legislative
exchange
council
alec
those
laws
disproportionately
disenfranchise
voters
from
minority
communities
studies
have
shown
a
federal
judge
for
instance
struck
down
north
carolina's
voter
id
law
in
after
it
was
proven
that
state
lawmakers
requested
racial
voting
data
when
crafting
its
legislation
african
americans
disproportionately
lacked
the
type
of
photo
id
that
north
carolina's
law
required
department
of
motor
vehicles
data
showed
north
dakota
also
imposed
voter
id
laws
after
former
sen
heidi
heitkamp's
d-nd
election
upset
in
the
state's
law
required
voters
to
present
ids
with
a
residential
mailing
address
when
voting
because
many
tribal
members
do
not
have
a
formal
mailing
addresses
on
reservations
and
instead
rely
on
p.o.
boxes
the
law
effectively
stripped
many
native
americans
of
their
voting
rights
