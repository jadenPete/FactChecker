here's
the
clearest
proof
yet
that
iowa
voters
may
have
finally
had
enough
of
steve
king
a
tree
falls
in
a
forest
but
no
constituents
show
up
to
hear
it
rep
steve
king
r-ia
managed
to
hang
onto
his
house
seat
after
november's
midterm
elections
despite
the
humiliation
of
having
been
stripped
of
his
congressional
committee
seats
amid
controversy
over
his
white
nationalist
views
king
made
headlines
again
last
week
over
a
bizarre
argument
during
a
speech
to
supporters
in
which
he
asserted
that
rape
and
incest
have
been
key
to
the
survival
of
the
human
race
laws
against
abortion
he
argued
should
therefore
have
should
have
no
exceptions
the
remarks
went
viral
and
were
roundly
mocked
garnering
condemnation
even
from
the
republican
leadership
liz
cheney
r-wy
who
holds
the
third
highest
position
among
house
republicans
wrote
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
that
it's
time
for
him
to
go
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
said
the
comments
were
not
befitting
of
the
office
this
isn't
the
first
time
i've
had
concerns
of
what
steve
king
has
said
earlier
in
this
congress
there
are
things
that
steve
king
said
that
i
do
not
believe
the
party
of
lincoln
would
stand
for
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
told
fox
news
as
a
united
conference
we
actually
removed
steve
king
from
his
committees
inside
congress
and
i
think
this
just
continues
to
show
why
that
action
was
taken
even
president
donald
trump
distanced
himself
from
king
according
to
cnn
i
don't
know
the
situation
with
steve
king
trump
said
thursday
i
read
a
statement
that
supposedly
he
made
i
haven't
been
briefed
on
it
but
certainly
it
wasn't
a
very
good
statement
but
republicans
have
for
years
ignored
calls
for
more
stringent
measures
against
king
over
his
racist
and
xenophobic
comments
such
as
censuring
or
removing
him
despite
expressing
exasperation
they
appeared
likely
to
give
these
latest
remarks
a
pass
as
well
his
constituents
however
may
not
be
so
charitable
iowa
voters
are
showing
that
they
may
finally
have
reached
the
last
straw
with
the
controversial
congressman
king
held
a
town
hall
on
saturday
for
voters
in
his
congressional
district
news
reports
said
the
event
was
attended
by
a
grand
total
of
two
people
a
viral
tweet
from
a
reporter
at
the
event
showed
dozens
of
empty
chairs
as
king
addressed
the
two
constituents
who
were
seated
several
rows
apart
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-mn
was
among
those
taking
delight
at
the
paltry
turnout
after
steve
king's
comments
re
rape
and
incest
this
week
this
is
how
many
iowans
showed
up
at
his
town
hall
she
wrote
on
twitter
while
expressing
her
support
for
j.d.
scholten
a
democrat
who
is
challenging
king
for
his
seat
scholten
also
took
aim
at
king
for
the
remarks
king
defeated
scholten
in
the
congressional
election
but
came
perilously
close
to
losing
despite
the
fact
that
his
congressional
district
iowa's
th
is
a
rock-ribbed
republican
stronghold
it's
been
another
long
week
for
iowan's
enough
is
enough
it's
time
to
retire
steve
king
scholten
wrote
on
twitter
amid
the
firestorm
meanwhile
king
complained
that
he
had
been
misquoted
in
last
week's
comments
about
rape
and
incest
despite
video
showing
him
making
the
controversial
remarks
when
we
have
a
national
viral
attack
that
comes
down
on
a
misquote
and
it's
absolutely
proven
all
the
folks
that
did
that
attack
i
think
they
owe
me
an
apology
including
my
own
leadership
he
said
during
a
different
town
hall
forum
after
the
controversy
erupted
i
don't
think
they're
going
to
do
it
because
egos
are
a
little
strong
in
this
business
the
leading
republican
challenger
vying
for
king's
house
seat
conservative
randy
feenstra
also
lampooned
the
remarks
as
bizarre
precipitating
a
twitter
spat
with
the
congressman
