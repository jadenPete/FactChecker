host
ends
interview
with
trump
campaign
spokesperson
for
lying
about
trump's
lies
lies
on
lies
in
a
heated
interview
with
cnn's
chris
cuomo
wednesday
night
trump
campaign
secretary
kayleigh
mcenany
defended
president
donald
trump's
statements
regarding
puerto
rico
including
his
invented
claim
that
the
island
received
over
billion
in
relief
funds
after
hurricanes
irma
and
maria
as
the
interview
spiraled
mcenany
claimed
that
trump
never
lies
prompting
cuomo
to
bring
the
interview
to
a
close
cuomo
opened
by
asking
about
trump's
decision
to
attack
puerto
rico
throughout
the
week
when
it
seemed
like
hurricane
dorian
was
heading
straight
for
the
island
in
one
tweet
trump
called
it
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
mcenany
insisted
that
the
president
is
fighting
for
the
people
of
puerto
rico
by
calling
out
the
corrupt
politicians
and
claimed
that
there
were
misused
funds
last
time
but
cuomo
pointed
out
trump
fought
tooth
and
nail
to
block
cut
and
stall
passing
relief
funds
for
puerto
rico
trump
has
also
repeatedly
lied
that
the
island
has
received
at
least
billion
or
billion
per
trump's
latest
claim
this
week
when
less
than
half
of
that
has
been
allocated
and
far
less
actually
spent
mcenany
defended
the
imaginary
number
as
coming
from
the
estimated
projections
of
what
will
be
provided
to
puerto
rico
over
time
ignoring
the
lies
trump
has
told
about
puerto
rico
relief
and
his
opposition
to
it
she
insisted
that
this
was
the
largest
fema
operation
in
the
history
of
this
country
throughout
the
interview
which
touched
on
a
variety
of
issues
beyond
puerto
rico
mcenany
defended
the
president's
record
and
echoed
his
attacks
on
the
press
the
president
is
lied
about
constantly
she
said
attacking
cnn
for
being
fake
news
when
cuomo
noted
that
trump
is
responsible
for
creating
his
own
negative
coverage
mcenany
claimed
he
doesn't
lie
the
press
lies
cuomo
was
taken
aback
by
the
claim
that
trump
doesn't
lie
and
pressed
mcenany
further
on
it
no
i
don't
believe
the
president
has
lied
she
confirmed
at
that
point
cuomo
brought
the
interview
to
a
close
before
segueing
cuomo
spoke
directly
to
his
audience
you
can't
say
that
this
president
doesn't
lie
to
you
guys
alright
he
said
you
can
argue
why
he
lies
you
can
argue
how
you
feel
about
his
lies
but
if
you
can't
even
admit
that
the
conversation
is
dead
i'm
sorry
but
it
is
the
interview
happened
the
same
day
the
washington
post
ran
a
feature
on
trump's
new
press
secretary
and
communications
director
stephanie
grisham
in
which
she
claimed
that
she
doesn't
think
trump
ever
lies
i
don't
think
they're
lies
she
said
i
think
the
president
communicates
in
a
way
that
some
people
especially
the
media
aren't
necessarily
comfortable
with
a
lot
of
times
they
take
him
so
literally
i
know
people
will
roll
their
eyes
if
i
say
he
was
just
kidding
or
was
speaking
in
hypotheticals
but
sometimes
he
is
what
i've
learned
about
him
is
that
he
loves
this
country
and
he's
not
going
to
lie
to
this
country
according
to
the
post's
count
trump
has
made
over
statements
that
were
false
or
misleading
since
taking
office
he
averages
about
such
statements
every
day
