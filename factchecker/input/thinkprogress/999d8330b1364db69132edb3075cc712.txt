trump
attempts
to
flatter
xi
into
renewed
trade
talks
using
hong
kong
protests
trump
tries
to
get
china
back
into
trade
talks
by
heaping
praise
on
xi
jinping
on
twitter
president
donald
trump
has
finally
weighed
in
on
rising
tensions
between
beijing
and
hong
kong
tweeting
thursday
that
china's
president
xi
jinping
could
bring
about
a
happy
and
enlightened
resolution
if
president
xi
would
meet
directly
and
personally
with
the
protesters
there
would
be
a
happy
and
enlightened
ending
to
the
hong
kong
problem
i
have
no
doubt
he
wrote
trump
threaded
his
thursday
tweet
with
one
he'd
posted
late
wednesday
hinting
that
if
china
wants
a
trade
deal
with
the
united
states
it
will
have
to
deal
with
the
protests
humanely
i
have
zero
doubt
that
if
president
xi
jinping
wants
to
quickly
and
humanely
solve
the
hong
kong
problem
he
can
do
it
personal
meeting
the
president
wrote
tying
the
trade
negotiations
which
one
can
only
describe
as
being
in
shambles
with
the
china-hong
kong
tensions
is
unlikely
to
go
over
well
with
china's
president
xi
china
has
already
warned
against
foreign
interference
in
the
situation
largely
ignoring
trump's
musings
on
how
it
should
handle
the
protests
china's
foreign
ministry
on
thursday
said
the
comments
were
noted
beijing
issued
a
statement
saying
it
was
considering
counter-tariffs
on
u.s.
imports
if
and
when
trump
goes
through
with
another
round
of
tariffs
as
he
threatened
earlier
this
month
frustrated
with
lack
of
progress
in
the
talks
the
president
said
he'd
impose
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
imports
starting
september
then
earlier
this
week
he
blinked
apparently
realizing
that
american
consumers
would
in
fact
be
paying
for
those
tariffs
in
higher
prices
as
importers
and
manufacturers
pass
the
cost
of
the
tariffs
along
to
shoppers
with
the
holiday
season
coming
up
trump
announced
on
tuesday
that
he'd
delay
that
round
of
tariffs
until
december
it's
been
a
year
since
trump
first
slapped
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
entering
the
united
states
over
what
he
said
were
unfair
trading
practices
which
included
forced
transfer
of
technology
and
currency
manipulation
these
have
been
long-standing
issues
that
other
administrations
have
attempted
to
tackle
ones
that
ultimately
lead
to
a
massive
trade
deficit
with
china
while
the
trade
war
has
had
a
negative
impact
on
china's
economy
the
optics
are
worse
for
the
united
states
while
xi
has
remained
largely
quiet
about
the
status
of
the
negotiations
trump
has
repeatedly
claimed
triumphantly
that
a
deal
was
at
hand
but
trump
is
the
only
one
that
has
proactively
ratcheted
up
tensions
prompting
china
to
slap
tariffs
on
u.s.
imports
to
china
and
causing
trade
talks
to
entirely
break
down
at
least
twice
so
far
those
tactics
have
persuaded
china
to
dig
in
for
the
long
fight
in
a
likely
attempt
to
stall
until
the
next
white
house
inhabitant
is
confirmed
the
trade
war
between
the
two
nations
has
also
increased
the
trade
deficit
and
has
taken
the
stock
market
on
a
rollercoaster
ride
creating
serious
uncertainty
in
the
global
markets
all
of
which
were
predicted
by
experts
from
the
start
this
is
at
least
the
second
time
in
recent
months
that
trump
has
begged
publicly
for
a
meeting
with
xi
the
first
time
at
the
g
summit
at
the
end
of
june
and
now
again
as
china
is
facing
a
major
crisis
with
hong
kong
trump's
comments
on
thursday
come
after
roughly
weeks
of
protests
in
hong
kong
demonstrators
have
been
clashing
with
police
demanding
officials
scrap
a
currently
suspended
extradition
bill
allowing
criminal
suspects
to
be
extradited
to
mainland
china
for
trial
formerly
under
british
rule
hong
kong
reverted
to
chinese
rule
in
with
pro-democracy
protests
flaring
up
now
and
again
over
the
years
this
most
recent
run
of
protests
which
started
in
june
is
by
far
the
most
intense
since
the
start
of
the
current
tensions
around
people
have
been
detained
the
standoffs
have
at
times
become
violent
with
police
shooting
off
tear
gas
and
rounds
of
beanbag
bullets
demonstrators
took
over
hong
kong's
airport
for
two
days
prompting
the
cancellation
of
over
flights
protesters
surrounded
and
attacked
police
stations
dozens
of
times
and
more
confrontations
are
anticipated
as
demonstrators
plan
additional
mass
protests
this
weekend
there's
concern
that
china
might
respond
with
brutality
recent
images
showed
hundreds
of
paramilitary
police
gathering
across
the
bridge
linking
hong
kong
to
mainland
china
carrying
out
exercises
at
a
sports
complex
there
