brett
kavanaugh
wants
to
make
it
even
easier
for
gunmen
to
obtain
assault
rifles
and
he's
probably
got
the
votes
to
do
it
on
saturday
a
man
in
el
paso
texas
walked
into
a
walmart
and
murdered
people
he
used
an
ak-
a
kind
of
assault
rifle
less
than
a
day
later
another
man
in
dayton
ohio
murdered
nine
people
in
a
bar
that
shooting
lasted
less
than
a
minute
but
the
gunman
reportedly
was
able
to
rapidly
attack
his
victims
in
part
because
he
used
a
high-capacity
weapon
meanwhile
if
president
donald
trump's
most
recent
appointment
to
the
supreme
court
gets
his
way
both
assault
rifles
and
high-capacity
magazines
will
soon
enjoy
special
constitutional
protection
it
is
likely
moreover
that
brett
kavanaugh
has
the
five
votes
he
needs
to
make
this
happen
in
not
long
after
the
supreme
court
struck
down
its
much
stronger
gun
regulations
the
district
of
columbia
passed
an
emergency
law
that
among
other
things
banned
assault
rifles
and
high-capacity
magazines
within
the
district
the
law
was
challenged
and
the
challenge
eventually
reached
a
panel
of
three
republican
appointees
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
two
of
those
judges
upheld
the
law
the
third
judge
was
kavanaugh
in
his
dissent
kavanaugh
called
for
a
sweeping
expansion
of
the
second
amendment
beyond
even
what
his
two
republican
colleagues
were
willing
to
endorse
regarding
assault
rifles
the
future
trump
appointee
argued
that
these
weapons
should
enjoy
the
same
nearly
unassailable
level
of
level
of
constitutional
protection
the
supreme
court
afforded
to
handguns
in
its
decision
in
district
of
columbia
v
heller
in
heller
kavanuagh
wrote
in
his
dissent
the
supreme
court
held
that
handguns
the
vast
majority
of
which
today
are
semi-automatic
are
constitutionally
protected
because
they
have
not
traditionally
been
banned
and
are
in
common
use
by
law-abiding
citizens
he
claimed
that
there
is
no
meaningful
or
persuasive
constitutional
distinction
between
semi-automatic
handguns
and
semi-automatic
rifles
the
d.c.
circuit
case
which
involved
many
of
the
same
parties
as
the
supreme
court's
decision
was
called
heller
v
district
of
columbia
the
two
d.c.
circuit
judges
that
disagreed
with
kavanaugh
rested
much
of
their
opinion
on
the
supreme
court's
statement
that
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
second
amendment
though
the
original
heller
decision
held
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
that
the
second
amendment
protects
an
individual
right
to
own
a
gun
it
also
laid
out
several
significant
limits
on
the
right
to
bear
arms
in
addition
to
permitting
bans
on
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons
the
heller
opinion
also
permits
longstanding
prohibitions
on
the
possession
of
firearms
by
felons
and
the
mentally
ill
or
laws
forbidding
the
carrying
of
firearms
in
sensitive
places
such
as
schools
and
government
buildings
or
laws
imposing
conditions
and
qualifications
on
the
commercial
sale
of
arms
and
the
section
of
the
opinion
laying
out
these
permitted
gun
regulations
also
indicates
that
other
unmentioned
gun
laws
may
also
be
allowed
there
is
a
catch
however
heller
was
a
decision
several
months
before
his
recent
death
retired
justice
john
paul
stevens
revealed
to
the
new
york
times
adam
liptak
that
he
helped
persuade
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
who
was
in
the
majority
to
ask
for
some
important
changes
to
justice
scalia's
opinion
these
changes
were
the
passages
in
heller
indicating
that
the
decision
should
not
be
taken
to
cast
doubt
on
many
existing
kinds
of
gun
regulations
kennedy
however
is
no
longer
on
the
supreme
court
and
kavanaugh
appears
unlikely
to
support
the
language
kennedy
pushed
to
include
in
the
heller
opinion
assault
rifle
bans
and
other
bans
on
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons
in
other
words
likely
hang
by
a
thread
one
more
fact
is
worth
noting
before
kennedy's
retirement
the
supreme
court
largely
avoided
second
amendment
cases
often
over
angry
dissents
by
justice
clarence
thomas
it
hasn't
heard
such
a
case
since
it's
likely
that
the
justices
avoided
such
cases
because
some
members
of
the
conservative
bloc
were
unsure
how
kennedy
would
vote
if
another
second
amendment
case
reached
the
supreme
court
so
its
significant
that
just
months
after
kavanaugh
joined
its
bench
the
court
announced
that
it
would
hear
its
first
second
amendment
case
in
years
in
fairness
there
is
a
chance
that
this
case
will
be
dismissed
as
moot
after
the
court
announced
it
would
hear
the
most
recent
second
amendment
case
new
york
city
changed
the
gun
regulation
at
issue
in
a
likely
effort
to
prevent
the
supreme
court
from
reaching
a
decision
but
there's
virtually
no
doubt
that
kavanaugh
is
eager
to
expand
the
second
amendment
and
little
doubt
that
the
supreme
court
is
now
in
much
more
of
a
hurry
to
hear
big
guns
cases
than
it
was
when
kennedy
was
still
on
the
bench
many
future
gunmen
may
soon
enjoy
broad
rights
to
purchase
the
kinds
of
weapons
used
to
commit
mass
murder
in
el
paso
and
dayton
