republican
senator's
new
financial
disclosure
makes
no
mention
of
underwater
loan
she
once
claimed
in
sen
martha
mcsally
r-az
said
the
bank
owned
most
of
her
elgin
arizona
property
but
she
has
never
listed
it
on
her
public
forms
appointed
sen
martha
mcsally
r-az
frequently
boasted
during
her
congressional
campaign
that
she
understood
what
it
was
like
to
be
underwater
on
a
mortgage
as
she
had
purchased
undeveloped
acres
of
land
that
were
worth
less
than
the
amount
she
owed
her
bank
but
seven
years
later
she
has
still
never
listed
any
such
mortgage
on
her
legally-required
personal
financial
disclosure
statements
despite
losing
her
senate
race
then-rep
mcsally
was
temporarily
appointed
to
the
late
sen
john
mccain's
seat
at
the
end
of
last
year
by
the
state's
governor
republican
doug
ducey
after
requesting
and
receiving
a
three-month
extension
in
may
mcsally
filed
her
first
disclosure
statement
with
the
senate
office
of
public
records
on
friday
like
her
previous
filings
mcsally
noted
in
this
disclosure
that
she
owns
acres
of
land
worth
between
and
the
unimproved
land
is
in
elgin
arizona
a
community
southeast
of
tucson
and
less
than
miles
north
of
the
mexican
border
in
her
unsuccessful
house
campaign
mcsally
repeatedly
mentioned
the
property
to
suggest
she
understood
the
challenges
her
constituents
faced
after
the
subprime
mortgage
crisis
and
resulting
economic
meltdown
i
bought
land
in
elgin
in
oh
it
had
been
climbing
climbing
climbing
and
guess
what
it
was
right
before
it
all
fell
i'm
upside
down
on
that
as
well
she
claimed
in
one
campaign
speech
i
bought
some
land
in
elgin
in
although
the
bank
still
owns
most
of
it
she
said
in
another
but
thinkprogress
reviewed
her
financial
disclosures
from
that
campaign
and
found
no
mention
of
that
mortgage
the
filing
notes
loans
on
other
properties
and
a
honda
car
loan
but
still
says
nothing
about
an
elgin
mortgage
last
may
a
mcsally
spokesperson
told
thinkprogress
that
mcsally
has
no
loan
on
elgin
address
and
it
is
therefore
not
a
liability
for
her
to
disclose
when
pressed
about
the
contradiction
between
her
speech
and
her
personal
financial
disclosures
the
spokesperson
cryptically
answered
were
her
forms
incorrect
answer
no
or
was
she
wrong
in
her
speech
answer
no
both
her
forms
and
speech
were
correct
her
office
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
new
inquiry
about
the
latest
disclosures
or
the
ongoing
confusion
but
despite
mcsally's
long-ago
promise
that
truthfulness
and
integrity
would
be
core
values
of
her
public
life
she
has
repeatedly
struggled
to
tell
the
truth
and
to
complete
accurate
public
disclosures
last
month
the
federal
election
commission
fined
mcsally
for
campaign
finance
violations
during
her
reelection
bid
including
accepting
in
contributions
above
the
legal
limit
from
people
and
failing
to
disclose
in
political
action
committee
donations
a
year
ago
an
audit
by
the
same
agency
unanimously
found
that
her
campaign
had
failed
to
properly
disclose
its
finances
and
had
failed
to
collect
required
employment
information
for
more
than
of
her
campaign
contributions
