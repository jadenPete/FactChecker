pentagon
rebuts
trump's
claim
that
he
defeated
isis
a
new
report
shows
how
troop
withdrawals
and
lack
of
long-term
planning
have
emboldened
the
group
a
new
report
released
by
the
pentagon
this
week
states
that
the
self-proclaimed
islamic
state
group
isis
is
taking
advantage
of
president
donald
trump's
troop
withdrawals
from
iraq
and
syria
and
rebuilding
its
capabilities
this
runs
counter
to
the
president's
repeated
claims
that
he
has
defeated
isis
this
week's
report
acknowledges
that
the
group
lost
its
strongholds
in
iraq
in
and
syria
in
but
it
cautions
loss
of
territory
does
not
spell
the
eradication
of
isis
on
the
contrary
the
uneven
u.s.
approach
in
those
conflicts
has
allowed
it
to
revitalize
its
networks
attributing
this
to
u.s.
troop
drawdowns
as
well
as
the
inability
of
u.s.
allies
to
stave
off
isis
in
iraq
and
syria
the
report
notes
uscentcom
reported
that
isis
militants
in
both
countries
employed
similar
tactics
of
targeted
assassinations
ambushes
suicide
bombings
and
the
burning
of
crops
according
to
the
office
of
the
dod
deputy
assistant
secretary
for
counternarcotics
and
global
threats
cn
gt
isis
is
likely
reestablishing
financial
networks
in
both
countries
this
is
not
the
first
time
the
pentagon
has
presented
facts
that
challenge
trump's
claims
in
august
the
defense
department
released
a
report
one
that
was
essentially
echoed
by
a
united
nations
assessment
stating
that
some
isis
fighters
remained
in
the
region
that
is
roughly
the
same
number
of
fighters
the
groups
is
estimated
to
have
had
in
the
levant
at
its
peak
despite
this
in
december
of
that
year
just
months
after
the
defense
department
report
trump
said
he
would
be
removing
u.s.
troops
from
syria
a
move
that
ran
counter
to
the
advice
of
his
own
generals
and
prompted
the
resignation
of
then-defense
secretary
james
mattis
mattis
departure
was
followed
by
that
of
brett
mcgurk
u.s.
special
envoy
to
the
global
coalition
to
defeat
isis
trump's
advisers
eventually
talked
him
out
of
the
troop
withdrawal
and
by
february
he
said
he
would
keep
between
and
of
the
u.s.
troops
in
syria
for
a
peacekeeping
mission
still
hoping
to
go
to
zero
by
the
end
of
april
which
did
not
happen
experts
told
thinkprogress
at
the
time
that
this
in-between
approach
would
be
dangerous
and
that
the
syrian
conflict
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
in
a
superficial
manner
either
you
are
all
in
or
not
in
a
march
speech
the
president
tweeted
a
map
of
iraq
and
syria
which
experts
immediately
noted
contained
several
inaccuracies
as
proof
that
isis
would
be
gone
by
that
night
but
this
week's
report
which
covers
the
period
immediately
following
that
speech
april
to
june
shows
that
isis
in
fact
resurge
d
in
syria
there
local
forces
have
struggled
to
detain
isis
fighters
and
secure
them
and
their
supporters
in
camps
in
iraq
during
the
same
period
isis
reorganized
its
leadership
continued
to
establish
safe
havens
in
the
country
and
saw
short-term
gains
as
a
result
of
its
clearance
operations
of
course
isis
is
not
only
present
in
syria
and
iraq
the
group
has
offshoots
and
affiliates
throughout
the
middle
east
asia
and
africa
notably
the
group
seems
to
be
growing
in
strength
in
afghanistan
trump
has
been
looking
for
a
way
to
pull
troops
out
of
afghanistan
or
at
least
half
to
start
with
with
his
administration
currently
engaged
in
a
series
of
talks
with
the
taliban
hoping
to
come
up
with
some
sort
of
peace
deal
that
would
allow
the
united
states
to
bow
out
of
a
conflict
it
started
almost
years
ago
u.s.
military
officials
on
the
ground
insist
that
isis
in
afghanistan
poses
a
real
threat
to
the
united
states
and
certainly
the
afghan
people
this
group
is
the
most
near-term
threat
to
our
homelands
from
afghanistan
one
official
told
the
associated
press
in
june
he
said
that
isis
core
mandate
was
to
conduct
external
attacks
and
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
before
something
happened
it
is
very
scary
they
said
some
in
the
intelligence
community
in
washington
are
dismissive
of
that
view
feeling
that
isis
in
afghanistan
lack
the
organizational
structure
of
the
group
in
syria
and
iraq
to
do
real
damage
to
the
u.s.
still
according
to
a
june
pentagon
report
on
afghanistan
isis
threat
is
growing
within
afghanistan
where
it
is
known
as
isis
khorasan
or
isis-k
isis-k
made
territorial
gains
in
eastern
afghanistan
regionally
the
group
continues
to
evade
counter
and
resist
sustained
ct
counter-terrorism
pressure
it
noted
