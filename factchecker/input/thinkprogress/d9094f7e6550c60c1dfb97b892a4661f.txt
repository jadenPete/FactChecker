just

commission

process
new
hampshire's
republican
gov
chris
sununu
vetoed
a
bipartisan
bill
friday
that
would
have
allowed
an
independent
redistricting
committee
to
redraw
the
state's
legislative
and
congressional
district
maps
in
and
beyond
the
veto
is
just
the
latest
sign
that
republican
party
leaders
want
to
control
the
map-making
process
and
preserve
a
system
that
allowed
them
to
racially
and
politically
gerrymander
at
historic
proportions
in
several
gop-controlled
states
the
last
time
district
lines
were
redrawn
in
but
supporters
of
the
bill
say
the
veto
could
actually
backfire
on
new
hampshire
republicans
currently
in
the
minority
party
in
the
state's
legislature
sununu
is
up
for
re-election
in
with
his
veto
the
governor
is
throwing
out
a
plan
that
would
ensure
republicans
are
treated
fairly
in
the
next
round
of
redistricting
even
if
democrats
do
well
in
next
year's
elections
said
yurij
rudensky
a
counsel
for
the
brennan
center
for
justice's
democracy
program
who
advised
new
hampshire
legislators
on
the
bill
sununu
said
in
a
statement
friday
that
he
decided
to
veto
the
bill
that
would
have
established
a
member
commission
free
of
recent
lobbyists
and
elected
officials
to
redraw
district
maps
because
it
would
have
created
a
body
that
was
unelected
and
unaccountable
to
the
voters
he
added
the
measure
was
supported
by
out-of-state
organizations
that
favor
democrats
during
the
decennial
redistricting
process
legislators
should
not
abrogate
their
responsibility
to
the
voters
and
delegate
authority
to
an
unelected
and
unaccountable
commission
selected
by
political
party
bosses
sununu
said
in
the
statement
we
should
all
be
proud
that
issues
of
gerrymandering
are
extremely
rare
in
new
hampshire
our
current
redistricting
process
is
fair
and
representative
of
the
people
of
our
state
under
the
vetoed
bill
the
member
commission
that
would
include
members
picked
from
a
list
of
applicants
collected
by
the
secretary
of
state
would
be
tasked
with
redrawing
the
state's
maps
state
lawmakers
need
to
approve
the
maps
former
elected
officials
and
people
that
have
been
lobbyists
within
the
past
years
would
be
barred
from
joining
the
commission
it
would
create
a
new
citizens
advisory
commission
to
bring
independence
transparency
and
public
input
to
a
redistricting
process
formerly
kept
under
wraps
rudensky
said
the
commission
would
be
charged
with
drawing
congressional
and
state
maps
under
a
process
split
equally
among
democrats
republicans
and
unaffiliated
voters
with
the
legislature
giving
final
approval
and
this
new
process
would
allow
voters
to
participate
and
monitor
map
drawing
under
the
current
system
new
hampshire's
legislature
which
is
currently
controlled
by
democrats
is
responsible
for
drawing
up
the
state's
political
lines
the
governor
has
the
ability
to
veto
or
approve
any
maps
but
under
such
systems
during
the
redistricting
process
a
number
of
republican
and
some
democratic-controlled
states
drew
heavily
gerrymandered
district
lines
using
state-of-the-art
mapmaking
tools
that
allowed
the
republican
party
to
win
a
disproportionate
number
of
congressional
and
legislative
seats
in
several
states
sometimes
imposing
extreme
anti-choice
and
anti-lgbtq
policies
while
the
u.s.
supreme
court
has
ruled
this
year
that
federal
courts
do
not
have
the
power
to
decide
partisan
gerrymandering
cases
a
growing
number
of
states
have
established
independent
commissions
to
draw
district
maps
in
a
non-partisan
manner
new
hampshire
would
have
joined
eight
other
states
to
have
established
such
a
commission
while
perhaps
not
as
extreme
as
other
states
such
as
texas
north
carolina
michigan
or
wisconsin
there
is
evidence
that
new
hampshire's
maps
were
drawn
in
to
give
a
disproportionate
number
of
seats
to
republicans
