the
trump
administration
wants
to
make
it
easier
to
fire

who
act
too
masculine
may

lord
open
thirty
years
ago
in
price
waterhouse
v
hopkins
the
supreme
court
held
that
sex
stereotyping
is
forbidden
by
a
federal
law
banning
employment
discrimination
we
are
beyond
the
day
justice
william
brennan
wrote
in
the
court's
plurality
opinion
when
an
employer
could
evaluate
employees
by
assuming
or
insisting
that
they
matched
the
stereotype
associated
with
their
group
nevertheless
the
trump
administration
filed
a
brief
last
week
asking
the
supreme
court
to
bring
back
the
day
when
an
employer
could
evaluate
employees
by
assuming
or
insisting
that
they
matched
the
stereotype
associated
with
their
group
the
trump
justice
department's
position
in
r.g.
g.r.
harris
funeral
homes
v
eeoc
wouldn't
nuke
price
waterhouse
entirely
but
it
would
severely
weaken
protections
against
sex
discrimination
and
give
employers
broad
new
authority
to
fire
employees
who
do
not
comply
with
stereotypes
about
how
people
of
a
particular
gender
should
appear
it
would
do
so
moreover
in
service
of
the
broader
goal
of
denying
civil
rights
protections
to
transgender
workers
the
thrust
of
the
trump
administration's
position
in
harris
funeral
homes
is
that
if
existing
law
is
broad
enough
to
protect
trans
workers
from
discrimination
then
that
law
must
be
rolled
back
even
if
doing
so
will
legalize
a
fair
amount
of
discrimination
against
cis
women
in
the
process
harris
funeral
homes
involves
aimee
stephens
a
trans
woman
who
was
fired
because
of
her
decision
to
transition
her
former
boss
claims
to
believe
that
the
bible
teaches
that
a
person's
sex
is
an
immutable
god-given
gift
in
response
to
her
termination
stephens
sued
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
which
provides
that
employers
may
not
discharge
any
individual
because
of
such
individual's
race
color
religion
sex
or
national
origin
thus
as
a
textual
matter
stephens
should
have
an
easy
case
title
vii's
language
is
capacious
it
forbids
any
discrimination
because
of
an
employee's
sex
a
term
that
in
this
context
refers
to
gender
as
the
federal
appeals
court
that
ruled
in
her
favor
explained
it
is
analytically
impossible
to
fire
an
employee
based
on
that
employee's
status
as
a
transgender
person
without
being
motivated
at
least
in
part
by
the
employee's
sex
the
entire
reason
why
stephens
was
fired
is
that
her
employer
believes
that
she
is
a
man
and
that
men
must
dress
and
act
a
certain
way
that's
discrimination
because
of
sex
setting
aside
this
simple
textual
argument
explaining
why
stephens
should
prevail
she
also
benefits
from
the
separate
line
of
cases
prohibiting
sex
stereotyping
or
at
least
she
does
under
those
cases
as
they
currently
stand
price
waterhouse
is
a
bit
of
a
confusing
decision
because
it
did
not
produce
a
single
majority
opinion
nevertheless
a
majority
of
the
supreme
court
clearly
agreed
that
sex
stereotyping
is
not
allowed
brennan
concluded
on
behalf
of
himself
and
three
other
justices
that
congress
intended
to
strike
at
the
entire
spectrum
of
disparate
treatment
of
men
and
women
resulting
from
sex
stereotypes
meanwhile
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
said
that
the
plaintiff
in
price
waterhouse
could
proceed
with
her
lawsuit
because
she
proved
that
stereotypical
attitudes
towards
women
played
a
significant
though
unquantifiable
role
in
her
employer's
decision
not
to
make
her
a
partner
so
brennan's
opinion
plus
o'connor's
opinion
equals
five
votes
against
sex
stereotyping
in
the
workplace
significantly
justice
anthony
kennedy
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
argued
that
title
vii
creates
no
independent
cause
of
action
for
sex
stereotyping
though
kennedy
conceded
that
evidence
of
use
by
decisionmakers
of
sex
stereotypes
is
of
course
quite
relevant
to
the
question
of
discriminatory
intent
his
dissenting
opinion
denied
that
sex
stereotyping
alone
is
a
valid
basis
for
a
title
vii
lawsuit
which
brings
us
to
the
trump
administration's
argument
in
is
harris
funeral
homes
brief
see
the
problem
here
this
passage
does
not
describe
the
majority's
view
in
price
waterhouse
at
all
to
the
contrary
it's
the
exact
same
view
that
justice
kennedy
took
in
dissent
having
confused
the
majority's
view
with
a
dissent
the
trump
administration
then
claims
that
much
of
price
waterhouse
must
be
rolled
back
indeed
it's
notable
that
the
trump
administration
is
only
able
to
cite
one
lower
court
opinion
that
supports
its
novel
view
of
price
waterhouse
and
that
opinion
is
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
james
ho
a
trump
judge
known
for
writing
aggressive
opinions
that
read
more
like
fox
news
editorials
than
like
judicial
decisions
the
ho
opinion
that
trump's
justice
department
relies
upon
does
not
cite
any
other
case
that
shares
his
reading
of
price
waterhouse
price
waterhouse
moreover
is
hardly
an
obscure
case
it
is
a
seminal
decision
that
recognized
an
entire
branch
of
american
civil
rights
law
according
to
the
legal
research
database
lexis
advance
court
decisions
cite
price
waterhouse
the
fact
that
judge
ho
and
the
trump
administration
wasn't
able
to
find
a
single
one
that
supports
his
reading
of
price
waterhouse
is
compelling
evidence
that
ho
is
wrong
it's
unclear
just
how
drastically
the
trump
administration's
reading
of
price
waterhouse
would
roll
back
protections
for
women
generally
but
one
line
in
their
brief
suggests
that
the
rollback
would
be
quite
significant
unless
price
waterhouse
is
read
narrowly
the
trump
justice
department
warns
a
dress
code
that
required
men
to
wear
neckties
for
example
would
be
susceptible
to
challenge
as
predicated
on
sex
stereotypes
perhaps
a
prototypical
example
of
sex
stereotyping
is
declaring
that
men
must
look
a
certain
way
and
women
must
look
another
way
although
some
lower
courts
permit
gender-specific
dress
codes
so
long
as
they
are
equally
burdensome
on
men
and
women
at
the
very
least
the
trump
administration
appears
eager
to
strip
all
american
workers
of
their
right
to
keep
their
job
even
if
they
don't
tailor
their
appearance
to
their
employer's
gender
norms
one
lesson
of
harris
funeral
homes
in
other
words
is
likely
to
be
that
the
fate
of
various
civil
rights
plaintiffs
are
unavoidably
linked
denying
trans
workers
the
right
to
be
free
of
employment
discrimination
means
rolling
back
doctrines
that
protect
other
workers
as
well
if
the
supreme
court
joins
the
trump
administration's
crusade
against
trans
rights
the
consequences
will
spill
over
to
all
workers
