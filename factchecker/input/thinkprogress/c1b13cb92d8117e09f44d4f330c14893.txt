the
completely
ridiculous
way
that
america
is
still
being
held
hostage
by
aaron
burr
talk
less
legislate
more
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
perhaps
fearing
a
future
with
his
party
in
the
minority
published
an
op-ed
in
the
new
york
times
on
thursday
that
offers
his
best
defense
of
the
filibuster
the
process
that
allows
a
minority
of
senators
to
veto
legislation
unless
the
bill
is
supported
by
a
vote
supermajority
mcconnell's
defense
of
the
filibuster
is
understandable
nations
with
fewer
veto
points
that
is
fewer
opportunities
for
opponents
of
legislation
to
block
it
tend
to
have
larger
more
robust
welfare
states
so
keeping
the
filibuster
will
help
preserve
republican
policies
even
when
the
gop
loses
elections
similarly
the
republican
party's
dominance
of
the
supreme
court
allows
it
to
shape
policy
on
issues
ranging
from
voting
rights
to
health
care
to
the
workplace
without
actually
needing
to
enact
legislation
if
congress
were
able
to
legislate
by
contrast
it
could
overrule
many
supreme
court
decisions
and
shift
power
from
republican
judges
to
the
american
people
the
core
of
mcconnell's
argument
is
that
even
though
the
filibuster
is
not
mentioned
in
the
constitution
it's
actually
a
core
part
of
our
constitutional
system
mcconnell's
notion
that
the
filibuster
is
rooted
in
some
grand
tradition
is
simply
wrong
the
filibuster
is
not
part
of
some
great
constitutional
design
handed
down
by
two
of
mcconnell's
favorite
dead
slaveholders
it
is
a
historical
accident
brought
about
by
one
of
the
early
republic's
most
notorious
figures
and
it
is
an
accident
that
went
largely
unnoticed
for
decades
after
its
creation
shortly
after
vice
president
aaron
burr
was
indicted
for
killing
alexander
hamilton
burr
returned
to
the
senate
as
its
presiding
officer
there
as
a
lame
duck
he
led
a
process
that
was
supposed
to
remove
duplicative
procedures
from
the
senate's
rules
burr
convinced
senators
to
eliminate
a
process
called
the
previous
question
motion
burr
however
was
wrong
about
this
motion
the
previous
question
motion
wasn't
some
parliamentary
irrelevancy
it
was
the
process
that
allowed
senators
to
cut
off
debate
on
a
topic
when
a
minority
wanted
to
keep
that
debate
going
without
it
a
minority
could
put
off
a
vote
forever
by
forcing
the
senate
to
continue
debating
a
subject
until
the
majority
gave
up
though
the
senate
made
this
change
in
no
one
seemed
to
realize
the
significance
until
when
as
matt
yglesias
explained
in
the
atlantic
a
minority
block
of
whig
senators
prolonged
debate
to
prevent
andrew
jackson's
allies
from
expunging
a
resolution
of
censure
against
him
since
then
the
senate
reformed
the
filibuster
several
times
to
make
it
harder
for
a
minority
to
block
progress
in
the
senate
allowed
a
two-thirds
supermajority
to
break
a
filibuster
that
threshold
was
eventually
lowered
to
and
then
to
for
confirmation
votes
but
the
filibuster
is
not
in
any
way
part
of
america's
grand
constitutional
design
it's
a
relic
of
a
mistake
made
by
a
lame-duck
assassin
