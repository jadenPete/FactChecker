questions
still
hang
over
nuclear
explosion
in
russia
the
kremlin
is
keeping
mum
about
what
exactly
happened
last
week
after
a
significant
nuclear
explosion
last
thursday
in
russia
possibly
the
worst
the
kremlin
has
seen
since
chernobyl
in
what
is
now
ukraine
moscow
is
keeping
mum
about
further
details
the
explosion
claimed
at
least
seven
lives
including
a
number
of
elite
russian
scientists
the
explosion
came
amidst
what
russia's
state
nuclear
agency
said
were
tests
related
to
a
nuclear-powered
engine
on
an
offshore
platform
in
the
russian
arctic
however
numerous
questions
still
remain
regarding
the
explosion
including
what
precisely
russia
was
testing
and
how
widespread
the
damage
from
the
fallout
may
be
the
leading
theories
pertaining
to
the
botched
test
center
on
russia's
nuclear-powered
burevestnik
ssc-x-
cruise
missile
which
moscow
has
previously
tested
the
burevestnik
missile
program
involves
what
the
kremlin
has
pitched
as
an
innovative
form
of
nuclear
propulsion
providing
what
president
vladimir
putin
has
pledged
as
an
unlimited
range
for
the
nation's
nuclear-strike
capabilities
it
looks
like
they're
going
awfully
fast
to
an
integrated
test
and
when
you
do
that
blowing
things
up
is
not
totally
surprising
said
cheryl
rofer
a
retired
scientist
from
the
los
alamos
national
lab
who
has
written
about
the
incident
speaking
to
thinkprogress
rofer
added
that
political
pressure
may
have
played
a
role
in
the
incident
it
looks
like
it
was
too
rapidly
developed
for
reasons
other
than
scientific
she
said
rofer
said
there
remain
a
number
of
things
she
and
others
will
be
looking
for
following
the
incident
including
potential
overhead
photos
as
well
as
whether
other
european
countries
detect
any
radiation
from
the
explosion
while
details
about
the
explosion
remain
unclear
the
repercussions
may
already
be
unfolding
five
atomic
scientists
were
killed
in
the
blast
all
of
whom
were
working
on
the
test
in
russia's
white
sea
according
to
alexei
likhachev
who
heads
rosatom
russia's
state-run
nuclear
agency
the
men
tragically
died
while
testing
a
new
special
device
a
separate
rosatom
official
said
according
to
bloomberg
that
they
were
part
of
a
team
dedicated
to
research
on
power
sources
using
radioactive
materials
including
fissile
and
radioisotope
materials
following
the
explosion
radiation
meters
in
the
nearby
town
of
severodvinsk
promptly
spiked
russian
news
media
later
reported
radiation
briefly
rose
to
times
normal
background
levels
the
new
york
times
reported
the
explosion
is
the
latest
blow
to
russia's
recent
push
in
broader
defense
innovation
last
month
a
nuclear-powered
submarine
caught
fire
killing
sailors
including
a
number
of
elite
officials
on
monday
night
president
donald
trump
tweeted
about
the
explosion
noting
that
people
were
worried
about
the
explosion
