women's

advocates
say
some
women's
rights
leaders
say
that
the
new
york
senator
encountered
something
of
a
backlash
for
being
the
first
senate
democrat
to
demand
the
resignation
not
quite
two
years
ago
of
then-sen
al
franken
d-mn
who
quit
in
disgrace
amid
accusations
of
sexual
misconduct
the
accusations
against
franken
which
came
from
eight
women
included
groping
and
unwanted
kisses
gillibrand
pulled
out
of
the
race
late
wednesday
making
her
the
first
senator
and
the
first
woman
to
exit
she
said
early
on
that
her
campaign
would
center
on
fighting
for
policy
solutions
to
problems
that
predominantly
affect
women
and
their
economic
and
social
equality
now
in
an
online
message
announcing
the
end
of
her
campaign
she
signaled
that
she
will
continue
to
fight
those
battles
together
we've
taken
on
the
fights
that
others
wouldn't
we've
led
the
fights
that
we
can't
afford
to
lose
for
women
and
families
and
moved
the
entire
field
along
with
us
gillibrand
says
in
the
video
message
we
have
put
the
civil
rights
of
women
front
and
center
and
never
backed
down
when
it
comes
to
valuing
them
bringing
issues
like
paid
family
leave
from
the
back
burner
to
the
presidential
debate
stage
gillibrand
championed
national
parental
paid
leave
that
would
allow
any
worker
three
months
away
from
the
job
to
adjust
to
parenthood
to
care
for
an
ailing
family
member
or
because
of
their
own
illness
she
also
made
reproductive
rights
a
major
focus
of
her
campaign
during
the
second
presidential
debate
she
challenged
former
vice
president
joe
biden
about
an
op-ed
he
wrote
in
the
s
that
opposed
a
tax
credit
for
assisting
families
with
child-care
costs
in
it
biden
had
mentioned
the
deterioration
of
the
family
during
the
first
presidential
debate
in
june
gillibrand
focused
on
abortion
access
and
said
thirty
states
are
trying
to
overturn
roe
v
wade
right
now
and
it
is
mind
boggling
to
me
that
we
are
debating
this
at
this
stage
in
among
democrats
whether
women
should
have
access
to
reproductive
rights
i
think
we
have
to
stop
playing
defense
and
start
playing
offense
gillibrand
also
paid
close
attention
to
lgbtq
rights
by
releasing
an
in-depth
plan
to
fight
for
policies
that
would
improve
lgbtq
people's
lives
such
as
prohibiting
conversion
therapy
improving
health-care
access
for
trans
people
recognizing
nonbinary
people
in
identity
documents
and
reversing
some
of
president
donald
trump's
rollbacks
of
obama-era
protections
she
also
spoke
with
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
to
discuss
her
agenda
for
advancing
transgender
people's
rights

tweeted
thank
you
sengillibrand
for
being
a
fierce
champion
for
women
and
families
but
gillibrand's
campaign
was
also
marked
by
the
controversy
around
her
decision
to
lead
the
calls
for
franken
to
resign
in
a
politico
article
that
came
out
in
the
fall
of
last
year
cited
prominent
donors
across
the
country
who
said
they
would
not
donate
or
raise
money
for
her
because
they
said
she
was
duplicitous
and
generally
untrustworthy

we
posed
for
the
shot
he
immediately
put
his
hand
on
my
waist
grabbing
a
handful
of
flesh
i
froze
then
he
squeezed
at
least
twice
it
shrunk
me
it's
like
i
was
no
longer
a
person
only
ornamental
it
said
you
don't
matter
and
i
do
in
november
before
he
resigned
franken
said
i
feel
terribly
that
i've
made
some
women
feel
badly
and
for
that
i
am
so
sorry
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
never
happens
again
franken
has
said
the
allegations
were
false
and
called
for
an
independent
investigation
in
an
interview
with
the
new
yorker
in
july
he
said
he
now
regrets
his
decision
to
resign
but
dozens
of
senators
called
for
his
resignation
even
the
top
democrat
in
the
chamber
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-ny
pressured
him
to
quit
according
to
the
washington
post
but
in
the
months
that
followed
outrage
in
the
public
and
from
his
peers
softened
against
franken
in
keeping
with
a
wider
societal
phenomenon
of
men
shunned
early
in
the
metoo
era
gradually
being
rehabilitated
it
did
not
help
matters
for
gillibrand
that
the
new
yorker
published
an
article
last
month
revisiting
the
allegations
the
piece
which
focused
on
the
first
allegation
by
a
conservative
talk-radio
host
who
starred
with
franken
in
a
u.s.o.
show
in
leeann
tweeden
quoted
various
senators
who
said
they
regretted
having
called
for
his
resignation
these
included

was
former
senate
minority
leader
harry
reid
who
said
of
franken
it's
terrible
what
happened
to
him
it
was
unfair
it's
possible
gillibrand
would
have
exited
the
race
early
even
without
so
many
prominent
democrats
and
donors
casting
franken
as
a
victim
or
even
if
critics
hadn't
seemed
eager
to
blame
her
in
some
part
for
his
downfall
but
advocates
for
women's
equality
say
that
the
entire
controversy
almost
certainly
cast
a
shadow
on
her
campaign
during
her
run
gillibrand
was
frequently
asked
about
the
allegations
and
her
decision
in
interviews
a
campaign
aide
told
the
huffington
post
she
was
asked
about
franken
at
least
times
this
year
during
an
interview
with
washington
post
live
this
month
she
said
i
couldn't
defend
unwanted
groping
and
forcible
kissing
and
i
decided
that
i
had
to
say
i
couldn't
support
it
anymore
and
i
couldn't
support
him

never
been
afraid
to
speak
out
and
her
outspoken
feminism
made
her
a
target
during
her
presidential
campaign
kristen
gillibrand
should
have
been
given
the
time
to
talk
about
the
issues
that
matter
to
women
and
families
instead
of
being
constantly
asked
about
al
franken
the
system
continues
to
be
rigged
against
women
who
challenge
the
patriarchy
but
we
need
more
candidates
like
kristen
gillibrand
to
take
up
the
challenge
and
win
the
race
prominent
political
thinkers
and
advisers
said
it
goes
almost
without
saying
that
her
call
for
franken
to
resign
unfairly
tarnished
her
campaign
gillibrand
