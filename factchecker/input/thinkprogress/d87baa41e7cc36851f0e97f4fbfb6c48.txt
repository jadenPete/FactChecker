appalachian
pipelines
face
new
setbacks
amid
renewed
national
scrutiny
two
fracked
natural
gas
pipelines
are
caught
in
limbo
two
controversial
pipeline
projects
in
the
south
and
appalachia
have
hit
new
stumbling
blocks
regarding
safety
concerns
and
legal
challenges
that
could
further
delay
construction
both
the
atlantic
coast
pipeline
acp
and
the
mountain
valley
pipeline
mvp
have
faced
numerous
setbacks
and
ongoing
opposition
from
locals
even
as
developers
have
pushed
ahead
but
the
latest
complications
come
amid
a
resurgence
of
anti-pipeline
sentiment
as
some
democratic
presidential
contenders
take
aim
at
fossil
fuel
infrastructure
more
generally
and
national
concern
over
climate
change
mounts
this
week
it
was
revealed
that
a
warning
letter
was
sent
by
federal
inspectors
last
month
to
dominion
energy
the
lead
company
behind
the
acp
warning
that
the
pipeline's
work
sites
in
parts
of
west
virginia
are
unsafe
as
e
e
reported
thursday
the
four-page
document
says
that
during
a
december
inspection
they
found
workers
laying
parts
of
the
pipeline
in
rock-lined
ditches
posing
a
safety
hazard
the
pipeline
and
hazardous
materials
safety
administration
phmsa
sternly
rebuked
dominion
stating
that
the
pipeline's
positioning
could
leave
it
susceptible
to
potential
stresses
and
or
damage
in
the
case
of
movement
as
is
common
during
hydrostatic
testing
done
to
examine
potential
leaks
and
structural
integrity
moreover
the
pipe
was
found
to
be
in
close
proximity
to
unsupported
boulders
which
could
impact
the
pipeline
should
they
shift
the
identified
conditions
also
have
the
potential
to
be
exacerbated
in
the
event
of
heavy
rains
and
or
washouts
wrote
phmsa's
eastern
region
director
robert
burrough
dominion
argued
that
the
inspection
had
coincided
with
a
court-ordered
halt
in
construction
when
work
on
the
pipeline
was
minimal
and
asserted
that
the
problems
identified
have
since
been
fixed
but
the
acp
has
struggled
with
repeated
setbacks
set
to
run
from
west
virginia
into
virginia
and
north
carolina
the
mile
pipeline
is
intended
to
transport
fracked
natural
gas
through
the
region
recurring
legal
challenges
have
halted
the
project
however
amid
concerns
ranging
from
endangered
species
protections
to
a
rushed
permitting
process
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
earlier
this
year
that
the
forest
service
improperly
authorized
the
acp
allowing
it
to
cross
the
appalachian
trail
both
dominion
and
the
trump
administration
have
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
but
if
the
higher
court
doesn't
take
up
the
case
the
pipeline's
construction
could
stay
paused
environmental
groups
see
the
acp's
faltering
as
a
success
and
are
attempting
a
similar
trajectory
with
the
mvp
on
monday
opponents
of
the
mvp
filed
suit
arguing
that
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
fws
has
proceeded
with
the
project
despite
threats
to
endangered
species
regulators
can't
keep
shrugging
off
the
environmental
harms
of
pipeline
projects
we
need
to
stop
destroying
habitats
and
waterways
for
fossil
fuels
that
are
driving
the
climate
catastrophe
said
jared
margolis
a
senior
attorney
with
the
center
for
biological
diversity
one
of
the
organizations
involved
in
the
suit
the
mvp
is
set
to
be
a
mile
fracked
natural
gas
pipeline
that
like
the
acp
runs
from
west
virginia
into
virginia
with
plans
to
serve
markets
in
both
the
southeast
and
mid-atlantic
regions
and
like
its
counterpart
the
mvp
has
faced
ongoing
pushback
not
only
from
organizations
concerned
about
the
environment
and
public
health
but
also
from
landowners
this
fall
the
supreme
court
will
decide
whether
to
take
up
a
case
from
residents
along
the
pipeline's
path
who
vehemently
oppose
its
construction
for
reasons
that
range
from
environmental
issues
to
private
property
rights
as
those
fights
play
out
pipeline
disputes
are
resurfacing
in
national
politics
this
week
three
democratic
presidential
contenders
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
gov
jay
inslee
d-wa
pledged
to
reject
multiple
controversial
pipeline
projects
should
they
be
elected
at
the
top
of
that
list
is
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
an
oil
project
originating
in
alberta
canada
along
with
the
dakota
access
oil
pipeline
but
the
nokxl
pledge
backed
by
bold
nebraska
and
other
anti-pipeline
group
refers
to
other
projects
as
well
including
enbridge's
line
pipeline
and
both
the
mvp
and
acp
public
support
among
americans
for
fossil
fuels
more
broadly
is
ebbing
as
awareness
of
climate
change
grows
and
alternative
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
power
become
cheaper
and
more
popular
in
a
push
to
accelerate
action
to
tackle
climate
change
many
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
expressed
support
for
the
green
new
deal
a
plan
to
rapidly
mobilize
the
country
within
years
to
achieve
net-zero
emissions
a
proposal
that
would
mean
completely
halting
oil
and
gas
pipelines
update
on
thursday
afternoon
the
mvp's
developers
announced
that
they
would
suspend
construction
in
habitats
populated
by
endangered
species
the
sierra
club
a
leading
opponent
of
the
pipeline
welcomed
the
news
in
a
statement
but
indicated
that
the
organization
would
continue
to
oppose
the
project
despite
the
capitulation
there's
no
way
to
build
this
dirty
dangerous
project
in
any
manner
that
wouldn't
directly
threaten
endangered
species
or
our
clean
air
and
water
