putin
threatens
to
develop
new
nuclear
weapons
if
the
us
does
so
first
if
you
were
wondering
when
the
new
arms
race
would
start
we'd
say
right
about
now
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
monday
said
that
his
country
would
start
developing
new
nuclear
missiles
if
the
united
states
began
doing
the
same
this
is
essentially
what
nonproliferation
advocates
and
activists
feared
after
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
inf
on
friday
if
russia
obtains
reliable
information
that
the
united
states
has
finished
developing
these
systems
and
started
to
produce
them
russia
will
have
no
option
other
than
to
engage
in
a
full-scale
effort
to
develop
similar
missiles
said
putin
in
a
statement
having
called
a
meeting
with
his
security
council
he
called
on
russia's
intelligence
service
as
well
as
foreign
and
defense
ministers
to
maintain
close
monitoring
of
u.s.
weapons
development
separately
russian
deputy
foreign
minister
sergei
ryabkov
on
monday
said
that
moscow
would
take
corresponding
steps
to
defend
itself
against
missiles
the
u.s.
might
station
in
asia
deploying
missiles
there
is
an
idea
favored
by
new
u.s.
defense
secretary
mark
esper
the
universal
mk-
launch
system
that
will
appear
it
seems
in
japan
can
also
be
adapted
to
be
used
to
launch
medium-range
cruise
missiles
so
these
new
systems
when
they
appear
in
japan
will
without
doubt
also
be
taken
into
account
during
our
corresponding
planning
said
ryabkov
the
inf
treaty
required
that
the
united
states
and
russia
then
the
soviet
union
dispose
of
nearly
conventional
and
nuclear
weapons
with
a
range
of
between
and
miles
should
the
pentagon
get
the
budget
it
requested
in
the
fy
national
defense
authorization
act
the
united
states
would
in
fact
be
moving
forward
with
developing
three
new
missiles
banned
under
the
inf
while
the
weapons
are
conventional
not
nuclear
capable
russia
can
dispute
the
validity
of
those
claims
just
as
the
united
states
often
disputes
moscow's
claims
about
its
missiles
the
united
states
and
nato
have
accused
russia
of
violating
the
inf
with
its
development
of
the
m
ssc-
ground-launched
cruise
missile
russia
insists
the
range
of
missile
is
within
the
limits
of
the
inf
and
that
it
is
not
nuclear
capable
the
united
states
and
nato
say
the
missile's
range
violates
inf
limits
and
that
it
has
been
developed
to
carry
a
nuclear
warhead
so
far
the
senate
has
passed
its
version
of
the
ndaa
and
is
working
on
the
appropriations
bill
to
fund
the
requests
therein
the
house
however
has
passed
both
its
version
of
the
ndaa
as
well
as
its
appropriations
bill
denying
the
million
requested
to
start
developing
the
three
new
missiles
the
two
chambers
will
have
to
reconcile
their
respective
appropriations
bills
although
the
white
house
has
hinted
that
that
president
trump
is
likely
to
veto
an
ndaa
that
doesn't
include
a
number
of
his
requests
including
funding
for
the
new
missiles
in
his
statement
on
monday
putin
also
said
that
the
end
of
the
inf
created
fundamental
risks
for
everyone
but
realistically
russia
has
long
chafed
against
the
limits
of
the
inf
calling
the
inf
unfair
moscow
has
claimed
it
limits
its
ability
to
compete
with
weapons
developed
by
other
countries
most
notably
china
which
is
not
a
signatory
to
the
inf
and
has
said
it
has
no
interest
in
entering
into
a
of
similar
treaty
that
would
curtail
the
scope
of
its
weapons
development
the
united
states
is
hardly
slowing
its
roll
these
three
new
missiles
would
be
on
top
of
the
three
new
nuclear
capabilities
for
which
the
trump
administration
secured
funding
last
year
and
these
new
conventional
and
nuclear
weapons
might
just
be
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
here's
why
as
of
right
now
the
new
start
treaty
negotiated
by
president
barack
obama
is
the
only
international
agreement
limiting
russian
and
american
nuclear
weapons
programs
and
if
the
signals
given
by
the
administration
are
any
indication
its
days
are
numbered
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
has
already
said
that
the
treaty
which
caps
the
number
of
deployed
nuclear
warheads
russia
and
the
united
states
can
have
at
will
not
be
renewed
after
it
expires
in
