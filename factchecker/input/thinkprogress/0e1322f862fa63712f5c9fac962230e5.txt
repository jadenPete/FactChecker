justice
comes
for
the
corrupt
dea
agent
who
tried
to
set
up
rapper
scarface
self-described
white
devil
chad
scott
was
convicted
of
using
his
task
force
to
buy
himself
a
truck
a
drug
enforcement
task
force
operating
along
the
gulf
of
mexico
became
a
rip-and-run
criminal
enterprise
over
a
seven-year
period
federal
prosecutors
revealed
this
week
when
jurors
convicted
the
ringleader
of
the
alleged
scheme
on
wednesday
they
also
vindicated
some
longstanding
claims
leveled
by
houston's
hip-hop
royalty
drug
enforcement
agency
special
agent
chad
scott
who
now
faces
years
in
prison
after
a
jury
found
him
guilty
of
seven
charges
had
for
years
been
accused
of
corrupt
conduct
toward
geto
boys
legend
scarface
and
the
rap-a-lot
records
label
court
documents
in
scott's
case
suggest
his
badge-bearing
scammers
grew
bolder
and
greedier
after
early
successes
stealing
from
drug
dealers
scott
eventually
decided
he'd
like
to
have
a
free
ford
f-
so
he
had
a
houston-based
drug
dealer
who'd
been
suborned
by
the
crooked
police
cell
buy
one
then
seized
it
as
part
of
an
asset
forfeiture
rather
than
hand
it
over
to
the
task
force
court
documents
say
he
falsified
paperwork
about
the
seizure
to
say
he'd
picked
it
up
in
louisiana
rather
than
texas
the
change
allowed
scott
to
start
driving
the
brand-new
truck
as
his
work
vehicle
rendering
it
in
effect
his
personal
chariot
whether
on
duty
or
off
scott
was
convicted
wednesday
of
multiple
counts
of
perjury
and
related
crimes
of
falsification
related
to
the
truck
swindle
and
other
rip-and-run
scams
his
co-conspirators
including
multiple
deputies
from
sheriff's
departments
around
the
new
orleans
area
who'd
scored
plum
assignments
to
the
federal
task
force
alongside
him
will
face
trial
on
related
charges
later
this
year
the
department
of
justice
said
in
a
statement
an
indictment
alleges
the
corruption
ran
from
at
least
to
but
some
houstonians
have
had
their
eyes
on
scott
and
his
pals
for
much
longer
scott
and
another
dea
agent
named
jack
schumacher
led
a
probe
of
j.
prince's
rap-a-lot
records
starting
in
the
s
though
the
label's
main
prodigies
are
most
famous
for
their
hit
damn
it
feels
good
to
be
a
gangster
it
was
featured
in
the
movie
office
space
scarface
and
other
artists
on
the
label
have
enjoyed
prolific
and
rich
careers
outside
of
that
hit
scott
and
schumacher
however
were
convinced
rap-a-lot
was
a
front
for
a
major
trafficking
network
and
used
their
probe
to
build
cases
against
numerous
people
associated
with
the
label
neither
j.
prince
nor
scarface
were
charged
in
the
sweep
but
schumacher
and
scott
sought
to
portray
prince
as
the
button-man
behind
a
murder
that
was
successfully
prosecuted
around
that
same
time
the
man
jailed
for
that
crime
lamar
burks
has
maintained
his
innocence
in
the
killing
which
occurred
during
a
dice
game
in
the
city's
th
ward
the
rap
moguls
weren't
shy
about
telling
the
public
that
they
saw
in
scott
and
schumacher
a
dirty
operation
years
before
the
current
federal
investigation
says
was
the
beginning
of
the
corrupt
activity
scarface
even
named
scott
and
schumacher
directly
in
two
songs
from
his
release
the
last
of
a
dying
breed
nineteen
years
later
court
documents
in
scott's
case
substantiate
much
of
what
the
houston
rap
scene
had
been
saying
about
the
local
dea
the
patterns
of
illegal
behavior
described
in
the
papers
will
be
all
too
familiar
to
longtime
residents
of
major
cities
where
police
have
made
similar
heel-turns
similar
cop
gangs
have
brought
down
once-prestigious
drug
war
divisions
in
the
chicago
new
york
baltimore
bakersfield
and
los
angeles
police
departments
to
name
just
a
few
distinct
from
the
legal
abuse
of
asset
forfeiture
rules
to
goose
department
budgets
these
cartel-like
police
cells
put
confiscated
cash
in
their
own
pockets
charge
drug
dealers
a
protection
tax
and
commit
home-invasion
robberies
targeting
traffickers
they
know
are
unlikely
to
report
them
to
internal
affairs
as
in
those
other
cases
the
kingpin
of
this
latest
crooks-with-badges
microcartel
had
garnered
a
flashy
reputation
in
the
local
press
before
prosecutors
took
him
in
star
dea
agent
finds
himself
at
center
of
sprawling
probe
as
drug
task
force
comes
under
scrutiny
read
the
headline
in
the
new
orleans
advocate
when
the
federal
probe
first
broke
three
years
ago
scott
was
described
in
the
story
as
a
legend
that
extended
to
the
world
of
drug
traffickers
where
scott
styled
himself
the
white
devil
a
ruthless
cop
who
strong-armed
informants
and
boasted
to
suspects
that
he
was
the
baddest
mother
along
the
interstate
corridor
scott's
two
convictions
for
falsifying
records
and
the
three
for
obstructing
justice
carry
maximum
sentences
of
years
each
the
two
convictions
for
perjury
confer
statutory
maximum
penalties
of
five
years
in
prison
he
will
almost
certainly
not
face
the
theoretical
maximum
of
years
served
consecutively
that
those
statutory
limits
imply
however
u.s.
district
judge
jane
milazzo
will
determine
how
to
apply
federal
sentencing
guidelines
to
the
specific
facts
of
scott's
case
and
announce
his
final
sentence
at
a
hearing
on
december
that
means
scott
will
learn
his
fate
almost
years
to
the
day
since
the
u.s.
house
committee
on
government
reform
held
public
hearings
to
review
scott
and
schumacher's
disastrous
crusade
against
rap-a-lot
