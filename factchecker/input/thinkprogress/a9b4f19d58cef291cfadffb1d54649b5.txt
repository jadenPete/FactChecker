there
is
no
such
thing
as
acting
alone
hate
groups
spent
years
perfecting
a
lone-actor
strategy
el
paso
is
their
latest
win
political
and
media
figures
have
reflexively
depicted
the
racist
who
confessed
to
last
saturday's
massacre
in
el
paso
as
having
acted
alone
technically
this
is
an
accurate
way
to
describe
what
patrick
crusius
says
he
did
that
day
in
targeting
the
people
whom
he
views
as
part
of
an
invasion
meant
to
replace
whites
his
finger
was
the
only
one
on
the
trigger
but
crusius
did
not
act
alone
no
race-hate
attacker
does
these
mass
murders
are
the
direct
byproduct
of
a
practice
of
obfuscation
and
disinformation
the
white
supremacist
movement
has
spent
decades
perfecting
it's
a
messaging
campaign
designed
to
encourage
in-group
believers
to
take
violent
action
while
tricking
outside
observers
into
believing
the
actor
was
self-inspired
and
isolated
it
is
an
intentional
robust
and
well-developed
system
with
a
clear
history
elements
of
this
lone-actor
strategy
can
be
traced
back
to
the
early
days
of
the
ku
klux
klan
pete
simi
an
author
and
expert
on
extremist
groups
told
thinkprogress
but
starting
in
the
s
white-power
leaders
refined
those
loose
movement
traditions
into
a
concerted
purposeful
set
of
practices
designed
to
inflict
violence
but
avoid
both
legal
and
political
liability
that's
the
strategy
to
get
individuals
or
small
groups
of
individuals
to
commit
violence
on
behalf
of
the
movement
without
the
violence
being
connected
to
the
movement
said
simi
a
chapman
university
sociology
professor
he
added
that
white
supremacists
view
it
as
one
of
the
most
important
strategies
to
their
success
the
key
here
is
this
is
not
just
a
person
who
for
whatever
reason
feels
like
violence
is
the
solution
to
their
problems
this
is
somebody
that
identifies
a
larger
set
of
problems
that
are
connected
to
an
existing
social
movement
and
sees
their
violence
as
acting
on
the
larger
interests
of
the
movement
simi
said
all
the
talk
of
the
el
paso
shooter
and
others
acting
alone
is
therefore
playing
right
into
the
white-hate
strategy
and
making
it
even
harder
to
come
to
grips
with
the
rapidly
evolving
internet-enabled
form
of
an
age-old
violent
ideology
we
need
more
focus
on
that
and
to
understand
that
there's
a
whole
movement
culture
behind
what
happened
in
el
paso
simi
said
because
that
keeps
it
from
being
looked
at
as
just
a
generic
shooting
rampage
the
key
to
the
strategy
is
community
community
used
to
be
built
at
cross-burning
rallies
back
in
some
woods
or
weekly
meetings
in
a
church
basement
now
it's
found
in
internet
chat
rooms
simi
said
but
the
rationale
remains
the
same
we're
just
a
like-minded
community
simi
said
paraphrasing
the
argument
of
the
race-hate
movement
we
just
come
together
we
talk
about
different
stuff
and
then
people
go
their
own
way
it's
not
our
fault
if
somebody
goes
out
and
does
something
like
this
sometimes
it's
single
individuals
other
times
it's
a
small
cell
of
three
or
four
who
ultimately
commit
violence
on
behalf
of
the
movement
but
eventually
inevitably
someone
will
live
out
the
group's
bloody
fantasies
we
have
no
idea
how
much
or
when
but
it
will
produce
violence
simi
said
violence
is
central
to
the
ideology
the
ideology
doesn't
exist
without
violence
so
there
has
to
be
violence
for
the
ideology
to
continue
the
el
paso
shooter's
attack
fits
every
element
of
the
lone-actor
strategy
the
chan
hate
boards
where
he
announced
his
plans
moments
before
opening
fire
are
but
the
newest
incarnation
of
the
strategic
pivot
white
supremacists
initially
made
in
the
s
today
tony
mcaleer
de-radicalizes
white
supremacists
with
the
organization
life
after
hate
coaxing
them
away
from
hate
groups
and
chat
rooms
and
rallies
filled
with
countless
other
aspiring
lone
actors
three
decades
ago
however
he
was
helping
usher
white
supremacy
into
the
internet
age
i
built
one
of
the
first
white-power
websites
in
mcaleer
who
co-founded
life
after
hate
told
thinkprogress
a
t
the
time
music
was
the
most
effective
medium
to
recruit
people
so
it
was
about
the
music
the
site
pushed
newsletters
and
white
supremacist
novels
right
alongside
the
skinhead
cds
but
mcaleer
helped
perfect
the
mix
of
incitement
and
deniability
that
persists
today
i
shifted
the
tone
of
it
to
talking
about
leaderless
resistance
i
encouraged
people
to
join
the
military
don't
get
tattoos
don't
make
it
easy
for
them
to
spot
you
he
said
i
would
tell
people
don't
mail
me
anything
i
don't
want
to
know
who
you
are
i
don't
want
to
know
but
here's
what
you
can
do
to
prepare
mcaleer
has
seen
the
lone-actor
strategy
work
from
all
too
close
in
four
guys
he
helped
bring
into
the
white
supremacist
movement
kicked
a
year-old
sikh
man
to
death
at
a
temple
outside
vancouver
the
men
had
come
into
the
movement
courtesy
of
the
messages
mcaleer
so
carefully
peddled
recruited
by
guys
i
had
recruited
kind
of
thing
he
said
once
inside
they
decided
as
the
strategy
hopes
some
devotees
will
decide
that
they
would
be
the
ones
to
do
something
on
behalf
of
the
hateful
community
mcaleer
channeled
his
early
interest
in
computers
into
setting
up
a
sophisticated
call-in
system
to
disseminate
white-supremacist
propaganda
it
was
the
late-
s
equivalent
to
the
anonymous
spaces
where
race-hate
killers
like
the
el
paso
shooter
lather
up
today
anyone
with
the
number
could
call
and
use
a
touch-tone
menu
to
hear
messages
recorded
by
mcaleer
and
the
hatemongers
he
considered
brothers
in
arms
at
the
time
the
former
white-power
recruiter
described
familiar
themes
to
the
actual
messages
he
disseminated
jews
secretly
using
the
media
to
hurt
white
people
all
the
classics
but
the
through
line
of
it
all
he
said
was
paving
the
way
for
the
lone-actor
strategy
most
of
the
messages
were
anti-immigrant
anti-semitic
and
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
where
the
legal
line
was
the
idea
was
to
go
right
up
to
that
legal
line
and
go
no
further
mcaleer
said
the
phone
line
and
early
websites
gave
a
digital
backbone
to
the
skinhead
punk
music
scene
where
the
british-born
mcaleer
had
first
been
radicalized
in
the
s
the
records
and
books
they
sold
are
still
touchstones
in
the
modern
movement
too
mcaleer
said
the
same
white
supremacist
tome
recently
recommended
by
the
lone
actor
who
killed
three
and
injured
at
the
gilroy
california
garlic
festival
was
among
his
best
sellers
years
ago
the
pop-culture
aspects
of
the
hate
movement
are
so
durable
simi
said
because
books
and
music
are
crucial
to
the
ideology's
survival
in
a
world
where
message
boards
have
replaced
in-person
meetings
anything
that
lends
to
some
portability
of
that
community
strengthens
a
person's
resolve
right
it
gives
them
something
to
continue
to
help
feel
a
part
of
that
like-minded
community
when
they're
not
in
those
shared
spaces
simi
said
a
skinhead
once
told
him
about
how
he
could
take
a
cd
and
pop
it
in
any
time
he
was
feeling
down
or
angry
and
it
would
remind
him
that
he
has
this
larger
community
he's
part
of
mcaleer
in
the
mid-
s
correctly
anticipated
that
the
internet's
evolution
would
allow
violent
white
supremacists
to
shift
away
from
organizing
in
gangs
that
law
enforcement
could
effectively
target
track
and
crack
it
led
to
the
birth
of
the
strategy
and
a
weaponization
of
the
media's
fondness
for
he
acted
alone
mcaleer
is
now
a
leading
figure
in
the
de-radicalization
movement
dedicated
to
teaching
police
and
social
workers
the
specific
techniques
that
work
with
white-power
devotees
fifteen
years
after
the
vancouver
killing
as
part
of
a
long
journey
of
reconciliation
and
atonement
mcaleer
met
victims
of
another
attack
on
sikhs
the
massacre
in
oak
creek
wisconsin
perpetrated
by
wade
michael
page
yet
another
lone
actor
product
of
the
movement's
modern
strategy
mcaleer
spoke
with
reverence
of
one
wisconsin
man's
attempt
to
protect
the
congregants
by
lunging
at
the
shooter
page
had
a
handgun
and
he's
got
a
butter
knife
mcaleer
said
the
recent
mass
political
violence
in
el
paso
christchurch
gilroy
and
elsewhere
reflects
lessons
white-power
leaders
learned
years
ago
simi
said
on
independence
day
weekend
in
a
man
named
benjamin
smith
went
on
a
shooting
spree
in
indiana
smith
had
been
a
stand-out
member
of
the
white
supremacist
world
church
of
the
creator
so
prolific
in
recruiting
that
wcc
head
matt
hale
had
named
smith
his
creator
of
the
year
in
but
his
acolyte's
decision
to
play
race-warrior
left
hale
in
a
bind
hale
did
this
whole
thing
of
like
well
he
was
a
great
creator
but
we
don't
promote
this
violence
simi
said
it
was
this
whole
wink-and-a-nod
type
thing
around
the
same
time
smith
killed
two
and
injured
others
in
drive-by
shootings
targeting
people
of
color
another
white
supremacist
named
buford
furrow
attacked
the
jewish
community
center
in
los
angeles
furrow
was
a
prominent
member
of
richard
butler's
aryan
nation
butler
disavowed
furrow's
attack
much
as
hale
had
done
with
his
creator
of
the
year
these
and
other
disavowals
are
sincere
for
pragmatic
organizational
reasons
but
not
in
terms
of
moral
revulsion
simi
said
these
folks
know
that
they're
subject
to
both
civil
and
criminal
consequences
in
butler's
case
he
was
successfully
sued
and
stripped
of
his
assets
following
furrow's
attack
in
the
wake
of
that
accountability
the
lone-actor
strategy
evolved
from
a
suggestion
to
a
movement-wide
best
practice
simi
said
fellow
white
supremacist
louis
beam
had
by
then
been
preaching
leaderless
resistance
for
several
years
beam
had
first
become
famous
in
the
movement
for
helping
to
burn
vietnamese
immigrants
fishing
boats
with
fellow
klansman
in
the
s
but
he
understood
their
hateful
war
was
made
vulnerable
by
organizations
with
member
lists
and
traceable
networks
of
assets
the
transition
from
member
groups
to
the
lone-actor
strategy
wasn't
frictionless
simi
said
but
it
helped
that
beam
and
others
could
point
to
white
supremacist
martyrs
who
had
assassinated
civil
rights
figures
throughout
the
reconstruction
era
and
the
ensuing
century
today's
web-based
version
of
all
this
may
look
slightly
different
but
the
idea
has
always
been
that
sooner
or
later
the
community
would
spawn
a
monster
committed
to
the
violent
fantasies
they
shared
what
i've
seen
on
and
chan
is
a
lot
less
disavowal
and
a
lot
more
just
open
endorsement
oh
the
only
problem
is
they
didn't
kill
more
people
simi
said
crusius
walked
up
to
a
police
officer
after
leaving
the
walmart
and
announced
he'd
committed
the
attack
it
was
actually
the
second
time
he'd
taken
credit
though
chan
owner
jim
webster
insists
crusius
never
uploaded
his
manifesto
to
the
site
investigative
reporters
at
bellingcat
showed
that
someone
on
the
site
had
posted
his
name
his
plans
and
his
written
explanation
well
before
the
first
reports
of
an
attack
the
guaranteed
anonymity
of
chan
and
its
precursor
chan
is
a
key
tool
to
the
newest
incarnation
of
the
lone-actor
strategy
the
chat
service
discord
provides
similar
insulation
and
is
another
popular
home
for
the
fomentation
and
as
bellingcat's
robert
evans
put
it
gamification
of
white
supremacist
terrorism
but
what
good
is
a
game
if
there's
nobody
to
play
with
the
community
ethos
once
provided
by
klan
lodges
is
still
necessary
like-minded
hateful
people
still
need
a
place
to
gather
and
goad
each
other
into
violence
and
a
fig-leaf
to
hide
behind
when
someone
actually
acts
on
the
urgings
of
their
peers
pages
of
the
playbook
that
white
supremacists
made
to
enable
their
terror
have
now
entered
the
canon
of
mainstream
political
projects
white
house
spokesperson
hogan
gidley
gave
one
demonstration
of
the
technique
in
a
fox
news
interview
on
tuesday
morning
just
a
day
earlier
trump
had
read
a
conciliatory
prepared
statement
denouncing
white
supremacists
the
next
morning
gidley
was
back
on
the
attack
calling
the
notion
that
trump's
repeated
warnings
of
an
immigrant
invasion
could
have
stoked
someone
like
crusius
absolutely
ridiculous
gidley
turned
the
thing
back
around
we
don't
blame
barack
obama
for
the
deaths
of
dallas
police
officers
he
said
tucker
carlson
joined
the
chorus
in
the
evening
hours
on
the
same
network
the
combined
membership
of
every
white
supremacist
organization
in
this
country
would
be
able
to
fit
inside
a
college
football
stadium
carlson
said
while
telling
the
faithful
fox
news
bubble
that
the
very
existence
of
a
white
supremacist
problem
in
the
united
states
is
a
hoax
that's
exactly
what
white
supremacists
themselves
say
simi
told
thinkprogress
they
pretty
much
universally
reject
the
labeling
of
white
supremacy
that's
what
you
see
with
tucker
we're
not
gonna
give
any
ground
on
calling
something
what
it
is
the
gap
between
the
statement
trump
read
to
cameras
on
monday
and
the
commentary
his
pals
delivered
to
his
base
the
next
day
gives
the
game
away
the
community
bubble
where
trump's
fans
hang
out
get
one
message
while
the
wider
broadcast
public
gets
another
there
are
some
parallels
there
to
what
the
white
supremacist
movement
will
try
and
do
in
some
ways
simi
said
it's
presenting
one
image
that
we're
not
about
hate
this
is
just
about
civil
rights
we're
about
white
people
feeling
okay
about
their
heritage
and
they
just
don't
want
to
be
made
to
feel
guilty
about
who
we
are
and
then
simultaneously
through
another
channel
you
get
messaging
that's
quite
different
where
violence
is
being
emphasized
where
dehumanizing
language
is
central
to
the
message
where
you're
depicting
other
groups
as
subhuman
and
so-forth
if
you
use
the
term
invasion
fox
friends
host
brian
kilmeade
said
tuesday
it's
not
anti-hispanic
it's
a
fact
fox
news
is
hardly
the
only
place
that
conservatives
can
hear
this
defiant
double
programming
after
el
paso
the
right-wing
radio
ecosystem
long
predates
the
television
network
and
big
tech
platforms
like
youtube
twitter
and
facebook
each
play
their
own
part
in
the
radicalization
pipeline
in
these
forums
hatemongers
are
even
more
insulated
from
consequence
than
their
fox
news
peers
michael
savage
took
full
advantage
of
that
freedom
on
monday
after
trump
read
his
headline-making
scripted
statement
i
was
very
disappointed
in
the
president
attacking
white
supremacy
he
is
now
saying
everyone
who
is
concerned
about
the
illegal
alien
invasion
is
a
white
supremacist
savage
said
that
is
going
to
cost
you
thousands
if
not
tens
of
thousands
of
votes
the
conservative
media
machine's
consequence-free
recitation
of
white
supremacist
talking
points
leaves
de-radicalization
experts
like
mcaleer
worried
for
the
country's
future
the
hate
communities
that
breed
antagonize
and
elicit
murder
in
el
paso
christchurch
pittsburgh
and
elsewhere
also
make
it
harder
for
groups
like
life
after
hate
to
reach
the
people
who
most
need
their
intervention
even
as
the
organization
expands
its
efforts
to
train
outside
professionals
in
law
enforcement
and
mental-health
fields
in
the
special
techniques
required
to
break
angry
hateful
young
white
supremacists
from
the
communities
that
foster
their
rage
mcaleer
said
the
bubbles
radicalizing
young
whites
act
as
ideological
armor
those
bubbles
aren't
just
hard
to
pierce
for
social-worker
types
they're
very
difficult
to
interdict
with
legal
tools
such
hard-power
policing
would
require
deep
and
alarming
renegotiations
of
constitutional
precepts
simi
noted
market
pressures
can
chase
a
hate
community
offline
now
and
then
but
only
temporarily
and
even
if
you
could
wave
a
wand
and
disappear
these
digitized
lone-actor-strategy
incubation
tanks
in
an
instant
mcaleer
said
the
psychological
preconditions
that
make
young
white
men
as
vulnerable
as
he
was
to
the
ugly
lure
of
white
supremacist
violence
will
remain
most
of
the
people
life
after
hate
de-radicalizes
have
some
form
of
trauma
in
their
childhoods
almost
all
have
what
mcaleer
called
toxic
shame
and
have
woven
their
shattered
sense
of
self
so
deeply
together
with
the
ideologies
of
hate
that
they're
one
and
the
same
those
types
of
things
inform
a
young
person's
identity
belief
system
and
when
your
identity
belief
system
is
impaired
you
see
yourself
as
worthless
not
lovable
less
than
human
he
said
healthy
shame
is
i
did
bad
toxic
shame
is
i
am
bad
by
the
time
such
a
hate-movement
member
ends
up
on
the
line
with
mcaleer
or
another
de-radicalization
counselor
whether
a
former
movement
member
or
a
total
outsider
they
are
hard
to
reach
it's
difficult
work
but
with
the
right
circumstances
and
with
the
right
resources
they
can
bring
people
back
from
the
dark
side
it's
very
difficult
to
engage
someone
when
their
ideology
and
their
identity
are
intertwined
mine
was
completely
it
wasn't
something
i
believed
it's
something
that
i
was
he
said
so
the
first
thing
we
do
is
listen
we
despise
the
ideology
but
we
don't
despise
the
individual
never
condemn
and
never
concede
people
alarmed
and
angered
by
the
escalation
of
phenomena
mcaleer
has
spent
the
last
years
of
his
life
trying
to
defuse
tend
to
crystallize
much
of
their
frustration
in
trump
individually
but
the
president
is
only
one
man
and
incitement
rhetoric
only
one
facet
of
the
lone-actor
strategy
that
despair
is
what
gave
rise
to
trump
if
we
don't
look
at
that
underlying
despair
it's
going
to
keep
happening
mcaleer
said
i'm
always
hesitant
to
blame
trump
because
then
it's
well
if
we
just
get
rid
of
trump
it'll
all
go
away
it
takes
the
argument
away
from
actually
looking
at
the
causes
and
finding
a
constructive
solution
to
it
