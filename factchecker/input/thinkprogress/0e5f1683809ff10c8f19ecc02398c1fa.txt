the
uae
a
key
trump
administration
ally
looks
beyond
us
interests
in
the
region
the
uae
appears
to
be
looking
for
exit
ramps
from
the
war
in
yemen
and
u.s.
backed
tensions
with
iran
the
small
coalition
of
u.s.
allies
in
the
middle
east
is
showing
signs
of
fracture
with
the
united
arab
emirates
uae
in
recent
days
signaling
a
significant
shift
in
alliances
in
yemen
where
it
has
been
fighting
alongside
saudi
arabian
forces
for
four
years
the
saudi-uae
coalition
has
been
supporting
the
yemeni
government
against
the
houthi
rebels
with
u.s.
support
their
campaigns
there
have
resulted
in
tens
of
thousands
of
civilian
deaths
as
a
result
of
airstrikes
some
of
which
are
being
investigated
by
the
united
nations
as
war
crimes
but
in
recent
days
uae-backed
southern
separatists
in
yemen
have
taken
over
the
port
of
aden
refusing
saudi
demands
that
they
evacuate
government
facilities
there
this
is
a
significant
development
when
taken
in
concert
with
a
number
of
other
shifts
in
uae
policy
first
in
june
the
uae
broke
ranks
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
trump
administration
on
blaming
iran
for
mines
attached
to
its
ships
in
may
that's
when
four
ships
two
saudi
one
emirati
and
one
norwegian
were
sabotaged
with
mines
as
they
were
docked
off
the
coast
of
the
uae
in
the
gulf
of
oman
there
were
no
injuries
and
the
damage
was
minimal
the
trump
administration
quickly
blamed
iran
for
that
attack
as
well
as
one
that
followed
in
june
before
any
kind
of
investigation
was
carried
out
iran
has
denied
any
involvement
with
the
incidents
a
un
investigation
into
the
may
attack
showed
that
there
was
no
conclusive
evidence
linking
iran
to
the
sabotaged
tankers
but
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
refused
to
back
down
from
their
allegations
the
uae
however
acknowledged
in
june
that
there
was
a
lack
of
evidence
against
iran
not
only
for
the
attack
in
may
but
also
for
the
two
tankers
damaged
by
mines
in
june
honestly
we
can't
point
the
blame
for
the
tanker
attacks
at
any
country
because
we
don't
have
evidence
said
uae
foreign
minister
sheikh
abdullah
bin
zayed
al
nahyan
if
there
is
a
country
that
has
the
evidence
then
i'm
convinced
that
the
international
community
will
listen
to
it
but
we
need
to
make
sure
the
evidence
is
precise
and
convincing
he
added
so
far
no
new
evidence
has
been
shared
with
the
public
in
july
the
uae
formally
announced
a
change
in
its
participation
in
the
war
in
yemen
although
it
had
already
started
scaling
back
its
participation
in
the
saudi-led
coalition
there
in
june
while
reaffirming
the
uae's
commitment
to
the
coalition
an
official
told
reporters
that
the
uae
was
pivoting
away
from
a
military-first
strategy
to
a
peace-first
strategy
in
other
words
diplomacy
but
in
doing
so
the
uae
will
have
to
deal
with
the
houthi
rebels
which
at
least
in
some
measure
are
supported
by
iran
the
extent
of
that
support
depends
on
whose
narrative
one
believes
the
saudi-u
s.
one
or
the
iranian
one
iran
is
the
main
challenge
to
saudi
power
in
the
region
with
the
uae
and
at
times
tiny
bahrain
and
kuwait
supporting
what
is
presented
as
a
sunni
arab
challenge
to
shia-iranian
hegemony
the
uae
within
spitting
distance
of
iran
across
the
persian
gulf
has
supported
much
of
the
trump
administration's
crackdown
on
iran
including
pulling
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
and
the
reimposition
of
harsh
sanctions
but
those
decisions
have
also
had
major
implications
for
the
emirates
which
has
carefully
cultivated
its
reputation
as
a
sort
of
las
vegas
of
the
middle
east
a
safe
haven
with
spotless
beaches
and
glittering
opulent
resorts
two
mine
attacks
spaced
a
month
apart
did
little
to
sow
confidence
with
the
united
states
ratcheting
up
tensions
in
the
strait
of
hormuz
a
key
passage
for
the
movement
of
global
oil
supplies
the
uae
sits
at
an
uncomfortably
close
distance
to
any
kind
of
potential
conflict
in
the
area
additionally
u.s.
sanctions
on
iran
are
starting
to
hit
the
uae's
economy
with
projections
that
its
billion
in
annual
trade
with
iran
will
be
cut
in
half
this
year
the
financial
times
reported
that
much
of
the
trade
and
tourism
coming
from
iran
is
now
finding
its
way
to
turkey
this
too
is
a
major
shift
following
the
islamic
revolution
iranians
found
themselves
blocked
off
from
much
of
the
world
many
of
the
country's
middle
class
saw
the
uae
as
a
safe
place
to
park
their
money
iran
is
adept
at
taking
advantage
of
such
fractures
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
it
might
respond
to
this
and
how
that
might
affect
u.s.
policy
in
the
region
when
saudi
arabia
the
uae
and
kuwait
started
the
blockade
against
qatar
in
june
dubbed
the
gulf
crisis
over
a
number
of
grievances
everything
from
state-owned
al
jazeera's
reporting
to
the
what
saudi
arabia
perceived
as
doha's
close
ties
to
tehran
it
was
iran
that
flew
aid
into
the
wealthy
gulf
state
of
qatar
iran
also
allowed
qatari
flights
to
use
iranian
airspace
as
its
neighbors
had
blocked
those
routes
so
far
officials
from
the
uae
have
met
their
counterparts
in
tehran
where
they
discussed
maritime
security
in
the
region
in
july
the
first
meeting
of
its
kind
in
six
years
