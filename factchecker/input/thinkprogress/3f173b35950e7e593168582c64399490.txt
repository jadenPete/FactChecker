california
governor
signs
law
banning
the
practice
of
using
condoms
as
evidence
of
sex
work
a
major
law
and
a
major
victory
for
sex
workers
and
their
advocates
prior
to
this
week
in
california
if
a
sex
worker
used
a
condom
during
a
transaction
that
life
saving
contraceptive
could
have
enabled
law
enforcement
to
bring
criminal
charges
but
on
tuesday
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
signed
legislation
that
outlaws
the
practice
of
using
condoms
as
evidence
of
prostitution
when
prosecuting
someone
for
crimes
related
to
sex
work
senate
bill
is
a
huge
victory
for
sex
workers
victims
of
sex
trafficking
and
their
advocates
now
sex
workers
and
victims
of
sex
trafficking
can
feel
a
lot
more
secure
when
reporting
a
crime
that
happened
to
them
while
they
were
working
before
sex
workers
had
reason
to
fear
that
they
would
end
up
facing
criminal
charges
themselves
just
for
attempting
to
report
a
crime
in
a
statement
newsom's
office
noted
that
sex
workers
are
frequently
the
victims
of
crimes
which
include
rape
assault
robbery
and
abduction
in
the
prior
legal
regime
a
much
larger
emphasis
was
placed
on
determining
whether
sex
work
had
been
exchanged
to
avoid
potential
prosecution
sex
workers
made
a
practice
of
foregoing
condoms
despite
the
risks
of
contracting
stds
and
hiv
sex
trafficking
victims
rarely
turned
to
authorities
for
assistance
knowling
that
they
themselves
might
end
up
in
the
criminal
justice
system
leaving
them
mired
in
life
threatening
situations
without
much
recourse
additionally
the
original
law
was
not
informed
by
the
accepted
nuances
of
sex
work
while
it
is
certainly
true
that
many
participate
in
voluntary
and
consensual
sex
work
many
are
forced
into
the
trade
either
trafficked
or
otherwise
committed
against
their
will
many
members
of
the
sex
working
community
are
young
women
of
color
lgbtq
youth
displaced
drifters
and
from
low
socioeconomic
backgrounds
the
national
center
for
biotechnology
information
has
been
warning
of
the
dangers
that
sex
workers
face
when
they
forego
the
use
of
condoms
as
the
organization
explained
in
a
report
while
advocates
for
sex
workers
touted
the
positive
impact
of
this
new
law
newsom's
decision
still
garnered
some
detractors
the
california
district
attorneys
association
said
that
this
is
bad
public
policy
and
sets
a
bad
precedent
there
are
already
sufficient
measures
in
place
to
protect
these
individuals
and
this
measure
protects
the
buyers
of
sex
trafficking
as
well
as
the
workers
the
american
civil
liberties
union
praised
the
change
saying
that
it
will
benefit
street-based
sex
workers
women
of
color
and
transgender
sex
workers
the
new
legislation's
author
sen
scott
wiener
d-ca
of
san
francisco
told
the
sacramento
bee
that
his
legislation
is
the
first
of
its
kind
when
sex
workers
believe
that
reporting
violent
crimes
or
carrying
condoms
will
get
them
arrested
they
simply
won't
take
these
steps
and
we
will
all
be
less
safe
as
a
result
he
said
