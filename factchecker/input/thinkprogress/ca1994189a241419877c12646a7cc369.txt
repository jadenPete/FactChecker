white
house
spokesman
claims
obama's
condemnations
of
racism
take
us
to
a
dark
place
trump
is
trying
to
move
this
country
forward
and
comments
like
that
take
us
backwards
a
spokesperson
said
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
on
tuesday
defended
president
donald
trump's
call
for
unity
after
multiple
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
in
his
comments
which
came
during
a
fox
news
interview
tuesday
afternoon
gidley
accused
president
barack
obama
of
taking
the
country
to
a
dark
place
by
speaking
out
against
trump's
previous
divisive
rhetoric
following
those
attacks
he
also
suggested
the
white
house
would
never
blame
democratic
lawmakers
for
inspiring
similar
tragedies
across
the
country
gidley
tied
obama
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-ny
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
to
a
spate
of
violent
attacks
without
evidence
we
should
soundly
reject
language
coming
out
of
the
mouths
of
any
of
our
leaders
that
feeds
a
climate
of
fear
and
hatred
or
normalizes
racist
sentiments
obama
said
monday
leaders
who
demonize
those
who
don't
look
like
us
or
suggest
that
other
people
including
immigrants
threaten
our
way
of
life
or
refer
to
other
people
as
sub-human
or
imply
that
american
belongs
to
just
one
certain
type
of
people
obama
also
called
upon
americans
to
reject
such
rhetoric
clearly
and
unequivocally
host
melissa
francis
asked
gidley
about
obama's
comments
after
the
shootings
specifically
the
former
president's
jab
at
trump
for
fanning
the
flames
of
extremism
gidley
appeared
to
suggest
tuesday
that
obama
had
missed
his
chance
to
make
a
difference
on
gun
reform
when
he
was
president
for
him
to
interject
himself
into
this
conversation
this
debate
at
this
point
it's
his
right
to
do
it
he
said
but
the
fact
is
donald
trump
is
the
president
of
all
americans
he's
trying
to
move
this
country
forward
and
comments
like
that
take
us
backwards
and
take
us
to
a
dark
place
that
we
never
want
to
be
and
we
never
want
to
visit
again
gidley
did
not
explain
what
he
meant
by
a
dark
place
but
he
seemed
to
be
suggesting
that
obama's
condemnations
of
racism
could
do
more
to
harm
the
country
than
trump's
actual
racism
gidley's
comments
tuesday
came
hours
after
counselor
to
the
president
kellyanne
conway
complained
that
many
had
blamed
trump's
racism
for
the
rise
in
white
nationalist
violence
trump
has
been
calling
for
unity
she
insisted
she
added
that
she
was
hopping
mad
the
media
hadn't
found
more
ways
to
blame
liberals
for
mass
tragedies
