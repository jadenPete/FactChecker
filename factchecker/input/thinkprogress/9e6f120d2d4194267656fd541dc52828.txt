sioux
city
iowa
no
one
knew
quite
what
to
expect
when
native
american
activists
organized
their
first-ever
presidential
forum
this
week
how
many
candidates
would
attend
how
read
in
would
they
be
about
the
issues
of
greatest
concern
to
indigenous
people
how
many
would
present
fleshed-out
programs
pertaining
to
native
american
concerns
one
day
after
the
forum
in
sioux
city
iowa
tribal
members
have
their
answer
they
say
the
two-day
political
event
went
better
than
they
expected
having
presidential
candidates
participate
the
best
they
could
reflects
the
understanding
that
the
native
vote
has
an
impact
on
national
elections
said
brandon
stevens
vice
chairman
of
the
oneida
nation
in
wisconsin
it
shows
engagement
that
was
more
of
a
conversation
not
gotcha
questions
he
said
one
barometer
of
success
is
that
the
candidates
seemed
to
have
a
good
grasp
on
a
number
of
issues
that
uniquely
pertain
to
native
americans
most
of
the
candidates
addressed
the
need
to
give
native
americans
greater
access
to
the
ballot
box
one
year
after
massive
voter
suppression
efforts
in
north
dakota
and
other
places
the
presidential
contenders
also
addressed
the
crisis
of
murdered
and
missing
indigenous
women
the
growing
awareness
about
how
climate
change
impacts
native
communities
and
efforts
to
protect
tribal
sovereignty
and
indigenous
lands
stevens
said
he
was
especially
pleased
about
the
timing
of
the
forum
getting
them
early
in
the
election
cycle
will
help
elevate
native
issues
he
said
candidates
command
of
these
issues
and
even
their
willingness
to
engage
with
members
of
the
community
about
them
marks
a
watershed
moment
native
leaders
said
it
means
for
once
we
were
treated
equal
our
voices
were
heard
they
spoke
to
us
as
they
spoke
to
the
general
public
said
o.j.
semans
an
organizer
of
the
frank
lamere
presidential
candidate
forum
here
the
candidates
also
addressed
the
need
to
reduce
homelessness
especially
among
native
veterans
and
to
improve
the
schools
several
candidates
addressed
an
issue
of
great
emotional
importance
to
many
in
attendance
who
said
they
wanted
to
strip
medals
of
honor
from
u.s.
government
soldiers
who
fought
native
americans
at
wounded
knee
an
battle
that
they
consider
a
massacre
the
forum
gave
some
native
americans
encouragement
that
they
are
finally
being
viewed
as
a
constituency
worth
reaching
out
to
it
just
gives
us
more
incentive
to
continue
forcing
out
our
issues
and
demanding
communication
said
semans
co-executive
director
of
the
native
american
voting
rights
group
four
directions
which
hosted
the
event
the
forum
included
competitors
for
the
democratic
nomination
and
mark
charles
a
native
american
who
is
running
as
an
independent
many
of
the
candidates
likely
faced
a
steep
learning
curve
to
get
up
to
speed
on
the
challenges
faced
in
indian
country
some
of
them
this
is
probably
the
first
time
they
dealt
with
native
issues
before
semans
told
thinkprogress
it's
not
that
they
had
the
strong
solutions
it's
that
they
heard
what
we
had
to
say
some
of
them
really
did
not
work
in
indian
country
or
know
any
nation
but
they
learned
they
were
actually
able
to
see
there
are
native
americans
and
to
listen
to
their
problems
and
that's
a
start
mark
trahant
editor
of
indian
country
today
who
moderated
the
candidate
forum
said
the
event
took
public
discussion
and
debate
of
native
issues
from
the
back
burner
and
gave
them
mainstream
prominence
it
raised
so
many
issues
to
a
level
of
discourse
that
was
just
unheard
of
trahant
said
issues
including
american
honoring
treaty
rights
indian
country
health
care
and
native
people
being
historically
undercounted
in
the
census
those
are
issues
that
just
don't
get
a
lot
of
attention
he
said
in
the
audience
too
prominent
officials
and
native
elders
from
communities
across
the
country
were
able
to
meet
share
ideas
and
trade
notes
on
issues
of
concern
to
people
in
indian
country
until
this
week
trahant
said
representation
at
all
levels
of
government
have
been
missing
the
native
voice

piece
has
been
