trump
administration
takes
aim
at
states
like
new
york
with
new
pipeline
rules
the
white
house
has
routinely
sparred
with
states
seen
as
at-odds
with
the
president's
fossil
fuel
goals
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
is
set
to
alter
permitting
processes
for
pipelines
a
move
opponents
say
is
designed
to
target
states
like
new
york
that
have
sparred
with
president
donald
trump
over
fossil
fuel
infrastructure
through
changes
to
the
clean
water
act
which
governs
u.s.
water
pollution
the
epa
plans
to
streamline
approvals
for
pipelines
along
with
other
infrastructure
the
water
regulations
have
up
until
now
been
a
sticking
point
as
states
have
pushed
back
against
the
trump
administration's
fossil
fuel
ambitions
epa
head
andrew
wheeler
on
thursday
signed
the
new
proposal
which
would
limit
the
ability
of
states
to
cite
the
clean
water
act
in
their
efforts
to
halt
fossil
fuel
projects
namely
natural
gas
pipelines
under
the
new
rules
a
one
year
deadline
applies
to
states
overseeing
permitting
processes
if
states
miss
that
deadline
or
cite
other
reasons
apart
from
water
issues
for
rejecting
permits
their
authority
under
the
clean
water
act
could
be
invalidated
with
final
say
then
transferring
to
the
federal
government
and
agencies
like
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
that
agency
is
meant
to
be
bipartisan
but
has
recently
slanted
conservative
the
epa
is
characterizing
the
rule
change
as
modernizing
and
clarifying
current
agency
rules
while
reducing
regulatory
uncertainty
for
adherents
according
to
the
proposal
exercising
authority
under
the
clean
water
act
has
been
key
for
states
looking
to
skirt
trump's
nationwide
push
for
expanded
fossil
fuel
infrastructure
as
well
as
during
prior
administrations
new
york
and
other
northeastern
states
in
particular
have
sought
to
use
potential
water
issues
as
a
rationale
for
blocking
planned
pipelines
as
have
west
coast
states
like
washington
the
trump
administration
has
clamped
down
on
that
resistance
in
april
the
president
signed
two
executive
orders
to
speed
up
oil
and
gas
pipeline
projects
at
the
time
trump
argued
that
states
resisting
pipeline
infrastructure
were
committing
obstruction
and
hurting
the
country
the
move
was
seen
as
a
favor
to
efforts
like
the
williams
northeast
supply
enhancement
fracked
gas
pipeline
proposed
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
climate
advocates
have
repeatedly
argued
that
the
project
is
at
odds
with
the
region's
efforts
to
combat
global
warming
now
the
back-and-forth
between
trump
and
certain
states
is
continuing
with
the
epa's
latest
rule
change
and
in
an
interview
with
the
wall
street
journal
wheeler
singled
out
new
york
what
we've
seen
is
states
using
the
clean
water
act
to
hold
up
these
projects
it's
a
regulation
to
tell
all
the
states
to
follow
the
law
wheeler
said
opponents
of
the
new
changes
have
already
argued
that
pipeline
companies
may
submit
paperwork
requiring
revisions
potentially
pushing
back
permitting
processes
until
the
one
year
deadline
expires
but
even
with
the
new
rules
states
still
have
a
significant
amount
of
power
over
permit
reviews
potentially
limiting
the
proposal's
impacts
the
new
proposal
however
is
likely
to
further
entrench
divisions
between
trump
and
certain
states
that
trend
extends
beyond
pipeline
efforts
trump
has
for
example
repeatedly
clashed
with
california
over
issues
ranging
from
vehicle
emissions
standards
to
wildfire
aid
in
a
sparring
match
state
officials
argue
is
purely
partisan
the
clean
water
act
changes
mark
a
similar
escalation
with
new
york
also
over
environmental
issues
thursday's
announcement
kicked
off
a
day
comment
period
for
the
new
rules
and
wheeler
is
expected
to
roll
out
the
changes
on
friday
at
a
national
association
of
manufacturers
event
in
south
carolina
