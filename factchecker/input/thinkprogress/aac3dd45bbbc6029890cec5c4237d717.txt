house
democrats
turn
their
attention
to
donald
trump's
involvement
in
hush-money
payments
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
picking
up
where
federal
prosecutors
in
manhattan
left
off
for
all
his
talk
about
hiring
the
best
people
a
remarkable
number
of
donald
trump's
former
campaign
and
white
house
staff
have
already
been
indicted
by
federal
authorities
roger
stone
paul
manafort
george
papadopoulos
michael
cohen
the
list
of
indicted
conspirators
is
a
who's
who
of
cheap
mafioso
knockoffs
not
on
that
list
anyone
from
the
trump
family
tree
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
refusal
to
indict
the
president
or
his
family
is
presented
as
favorable
evidence
by
the
white
house
and
its
allies
to
suggest
trump
was
somehow
vindicated
and
acquitted
of
any
wrongdoing
not
only
did
mueller
not
acquit
trump
now
it
turns
out
the
white
house's
celebration
for
avoiding
indictments
may
have
been
a
bit
premature
house
democrats
back
in
session
after
the
summer
recess
are
reportedly
preparing
to
launch
a
comprehensive
investigation
into
hush-money
payments
made
on
trump's
behalf
to
at
least
two
women
former
playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
and
adult
film
actress
stormy
daniels
both
women
say
they
had
affairs
with
trump
details
of
those
payments
were
largely
made
public
over
a
year
ago
during
the
height
of
mueller's
wide-ranging
investigation
michael
cohen
trump's
former
personal
attorney
and
fixer
cooperated
with
the
investigation
and
with
lawmakers
outlining
the
setup
he
arranged
to
pay
off
daniels
to
keep
her
from
going
public
with
her
story
mcdougal
was
given
a
similar
financial
arrangement
by
the
owners
of
the
national
enquirer
mueller's
team
passed
on
its
findings
to
federal
prosecutors
in
manhattan
who
had
jurisdiction
over
possible
criminal
charges
cohen
is
currently
serving
a
three-year
prison
sentence
but
prosecutors
declined
to
pursue
any
further
criminal
charges
even
after
cohen
testified
under
oath
that
trump
was
the
one
who
directed
him
to
make
the
illegal
payments
now
the
house
judiciary
committee
will
pick
up
where
federal
prosecutors
left
off
according
to
the
washington
post
democrats
on
the
committee
are
preparing
to
schedule
hearings
on
the
matter
and
are
eyeing
possible
witnesses
to
bring
before
congress
and
answer
questions
about
trump's
involvement
in
the
payments
perhaps
most
notable
among
the
potential
witnesses
is
david
pecker
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
american
media
inc
which
owns
the
national
enquirer
pecker
is
a
longtime
trump
confidant
and
the
architect
of
the
tabloid's
catch
and
kill
policy
that
resulted
in
the
payout
to
mcdougal
in
the
weeks
before
the
election
documents
show
cohen
facilitated
various
conversations
with
pecker
trump
and
national
enquirer
editor
dylan
howard
the
contents
and
timing
of
those
messages
and
conversations
were
enough
to
prompt
one
fbi
agent
to
posit
that
one
purpose
of
those
communications
was
to
prevent
daniels
from
going
public
trump's
knowledge
of
and
possible
involvement
in
the
stormy
daniels
hush
money
drama
is
still
under
debate
first
the
white
house
denied
trump
had
an
affair
with
daniels
after
the
wall
street
journal
broke
the
news
of
the
hush
money
payments
trump
himself
denied
having
any
knowledge
of
the
financial
arrangement
then
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
acknowledged
that
the
president
had
reimbursed
cohen
for
the
he
paid
daniels
depending
on
what
the
judiciary
committee
unearths
donald
trump
might
not
be
out
of
the
woods
just
yet
when
it
comes
to
legal
repercussions
