trump
campaign
promotes
qanon
conspiracy
theory
after
fbi
calls
it
a
threat
to
domestic
terror
the
ad
has
been
taken
down
but
the
message
is
out
a
week
after
the
fbi
designated
internet
conspiracy
theories
like
qanon
a
potential
domestic
terror
threat
the
trump
campaign
put
out
an
ad
featuring
signs
that
supported
the
theory
the
ad
has
since
been
deleted
but
its
impact
on
the
conspiracy
theory
cannot
be
reversed
the
women
for
trump
ad
was
released
sometime
last
week
and
featured
multiple
trump
supporters
holding
signs
that
referred
to
qanon
one
was
a
sign
that
said
wqmen
fqr
trump
while
another
said
keep
america
great
with
a
large
q
added
to
it
while
it's
true
that
qanon
believers
gather
regularly
at
trump
rallies
and
can
easily
be
seen
among
other
supporters
the
inclusion
of
two
different
images
focused
on
q
signs
seems
hard
to
excuse
as
an
oversight
the
campaign
issued
no
comment
about
the
video
or
its
eventual
removal
from
youtube
qanon
an
extension
of
the
pizzagate
conspiracy
that
motivated
a
gunman
to
fire
shots
in
a
washington
d.c.
pizzeria
is
the
unfounded
belief
that
president
donald
trump
and
other
washington
insiders
are
secretly
working
to
take
down
a
cabal
of
democrats
that
traffic
children
across
the
world
it's
fueled
not
only
by
anonymous
chan
poster
q
but
also
by
trump
himself
through
retweets
of
qanon
accounts
on
twitter
not
to
mention
any
number
of
turns
of
phrase
the
conspiracy
theorists
interpret
as
validation
a
campaign
ad
that
directly
cites
two
q
references
is
a
massive
cue
to
believers
that
they're
onto
something
whether
inclusion
of
the
signs
was
intentional
or
not
the
fbi
warned
that
the
internet
allows
conspiracy
theories
to
easily
spread
to
large
audiences
which
could
reach
extremist-minded
individuals
and
motivate
them
to
possibly
carry
out
criminal
or
violent
actions
as
a
result
while
the
qanon
conspiracy
does
not
overtly
espouse
violence
it
has
nevertheless
been
responsible
for
inspiring
numerous
violent
acts
including
two
qanon
believers
who
have
been
charged
with
murder
as
the
washington
post's
alyssa
rosenberg
noted
qanon
is
like
a
live-action
video
game
while
its
tenets
are
easily
dismissed
the
zealousness
of
its
adherents
cannot
so
easily
be
ignored
