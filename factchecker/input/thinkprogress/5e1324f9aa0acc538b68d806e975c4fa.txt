trump's
administration
can
now
bar
immigrants
for
being
too
poor
i'm
certainly
not
prepared
to
take
anything
down
off
the
statue
of
liberty
on
monday
the
trump
administration
finalized
its
public
charge
rule
which
will
more
forcefully
impose
a
health
and
wealth
test
on
people
seeking
green
cards
or
temporary
visas
in
the
united
states
the
page
final
rule
itself
begins
this
final
rule
amends
dhs
regulations
by
prescribing
how
dhs
will
determine
whether
an
alien
applying
for
admission
or
adjustment
of
status
is
inadmissible
to
the
united
states
because
he
or
she
is
likely
at
any
time
to
become
a
public
charge
u.s.
officials
under
the
finalized
rule
will
be
required
to
look
at
immigrants
current
or
likely
future
need
for
help
in
the
form
of
things
like
medicaid
housing
vouchers
and
food
stamps
currently
those
officials
ask
people
seeking
green
cards
to
prove
they
will
not
be
a
burden
but
this
new
rule
requires
the
officials
to
look
at
immigrants
health
and
monetary
needs
for
basic
programs
intended
to
help
people
this
means
any
immigrant
with
a
medical
condition
and
no
subsidized
form
of
health
insurance
would
fail
the
test
the
rule
also
asks
prospective
immigrants
to
make
at
least
above
the
federal
poverty
line
a
report
released
last
year
from
the
center
for
american
progress
found
that
million
americans
almost
a
third
of
the
population
would
not
meet
these
criteria
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
newsroom
housed
within
the
center
for
american
progress
ken
cuccinelli
acting
director
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
addressed
reporters
in
the
rarely-used
white
house
briefing
room
to
explain
the
final
rule
which
goes
into
effect
for
all
immigrants
in
mid-october
cuccinelli
began
his
statement
with
an
odd
defense
of
his
own
immigrant
ancestors
economic
well-being
as
they
assimilated
into
the
country
to
attempt
to
paint
the
rule
in
a
reasonable
light
he
did
not
mention
whether
his
family
was
fleeing
persecution
or
if
they
came
through
ellis
island
in
view
of
the
statue
of
liberty
and
its
new
colossus
poem
by
emma
lazarus
lazarus
poem
ends
cuccinelli
was
asked
about
the
poem
and
if
it
still
applied
in
the
united
states
during
the
briefing
and
his
reply
was
i'm
certainly
not
prepared
to
take
anything
down
off
the
statue
of
liberty
and
explained
that
america
has
always
been
a
welcoming
country
president
trump's
administration
is
reinforcing
the
ideals
of
self-sufficiency
and
personal
responsibility
cuccinelli
said
he
defined
a
public
charge
as
an
individual
who
receives
one
or
more
designated
public
benefits
for
more
than
months
in
the
aggregate
within
any
month
period
immigration
advocates
quickly
pointed
out
that
this
policy
gives
an
explicit
advantage
to
wealthy
immigrants
over
poorer
ones
which
can
track
to
a
preference
for
people
from
richer
often
whiter
countries
the
national
immigration
law
center
on
monday
announced
that
it
intends
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
stop
the
rule
marielena
hincapi
the
group's
executive
director
said
in
a
statement
this
news
is
a
cruel
new
step
toward
weaponizing
programs
that
are
intended
to
help
people
by
making
them
instead
a
means
of
separating
families
and
sending
immigrants
and
communities
of
color
one
message
you
are
not
welcome
here
we
look
forward
to
seeing
trump
in
court
again
and
to
seeing
justice
prevail
she
said
lambda
legal
the
nation's
largest
lgbtq
legal
advocacy
organization
said
on
twitter
that
the
rule
was
flat-out
inhumane
and
would
force
people
to
have
to
make
the
choice
between
feeding
their
families
caring
for
their
medical
needs
or
seeking
documented
resident
status
the
migration
policy
institute
said
in
a
recent
report
we
estimate
that
million
of
the
million
legally
present
noncitizens
who
arrived
during
the
past
five
years
do
not
have
incomes
sufficient
to
meet
the
percent
standard
in
fact
of
u.s.
born
persons
would
be
unable
to
meet
that
threshold
this
policy
announcement
comes
just
days
after
massive
raids
targeting
largely
latinx
immigrants
working
in
chicken
processing
plants
in
mississippi
and
racist
statements
president
donald
trump
made
about
sending
nonwhite
lawmakers
back
to
their
home
countries
asked
why
the
latinx
community
should
not
feel
targeted
by
this
administration
cuccinelli
replied
there's
no
reason
for
any
particular
group
to
feel
like
this
is
targeting
them
this
will
apply
across
the
world
before
making
a
similar
defense
of
past
immigration
rules
that
might
be
seen
to
target
italian
or
irish
immigrants
over
years
ago
