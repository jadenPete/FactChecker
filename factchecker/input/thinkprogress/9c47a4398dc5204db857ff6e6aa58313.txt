president
donald
trump
despite
his
empty
claims
that
he's
the
most
pro-military
president
ever
is
preparing
to
drain
funds
from
schools
and
day
care
centers
that
serve
military
families
as
well
as
stalling
readiness
projects
to
pay
for
his
promised
border
wall
the
pentagon
is
diverting
billions
of
dollars
from
already
funded
projects
at
military
bases
around
the
world
in
order
to
rush
fence

officials
announced
wednesday
the
department
indicated
the
shunting
of
money
away
from
military
child
care
offerings
was
not
dod's
idea
a
pentagon
official
said
in
a
briefing
that
the
department
was
given
a
lawful
order
by
trump
to
divert
the
funds
reuters
reported
wednesday
the
department
also
stressed
that
the
day
care
and
other
projects
being
defunded
were
scheduled
to
break
ground
next
fiscal
year
suggesting
that
they
are
not
stopping
work
on
active
construction
to
yank
money
to
the
border
the
delayed
projects
related
to
quality-of-life
for
families
on
bases
include
a
new
elementary
school
tied
to
a
u.s.
military
facility
in
germany
a
day
care
center
at
the
maryland
base
where
the
primary
crews
responsible
for
servicing
and
operating
air
force
one
are
stationed
and
a
new
fire
station
at
a
marine
corps
facility
in
south
carolina
housing
construction
for
troops
and
families
on
bases
is
being
held
harmless
in
the
fund
diversion
the
pentagon
said
the
department
has
also
deferred
various
projects
tied
to
training
and
readiness
for
troops
themselves
according
to
the
new
york
times
a
pistol
range
in
oklahoma
a
cyber-defense
facility
in
virginia
various
unspecified
flight
simulators
scheduled
repairs
at
ports
and
firing
range
facilities
will
all
be
mothballed
to
build
the
fencing
according
to
the
times
a
total
of
billion
in
already-appropriated
dod
funds
is
being
shifted
to
trump's
fencing
projects
according
to
a
department
letter
reported
tuesday
by
the
daily
beast
the
word
wall
appears
zero
times
in
the
letter
the
site
noted
but
it
lists
locations
and
structural
details
for
total
miles
of
new
fence
much
of
that
length
will
replace
or
augment
existing
structures
more
than
a
third
of
the
total
cost
and
mileage
goes
to
the
miles
of
rio
grande
riverfront
stretching
north
from
laredo
texas
the
bulk
of
the
other
projects
however
either
replace
existing
pedestrian
and
vehicle
barriers
with
newer
versions
or
add
additional
layers
to
existing
fence
lines
much
of
the
u.s.
mexico
border
is
already
fenced
from
previous
administrations
own
lower-profile
efforts
at
enhancing
security
those
projects
have
left
scars
in
border
communities
where
property
owners
subjected
to
eminent
domain
frequently
received
low-ball
compensation
offers
and
misleading
pitches
about
how
the
new
barriers
would
affect
their
ability
to
utilize
the
land
they
still
own
after
the
feds
are
done
building
lawsuits
and
massive
settlements
followed
those
prior
waves
of
construction
adding
to
the
up-front
cost
of
the
projects
the
big
takeaway
from
government
reviews
of
what
had
gone
wrong
was
that
rushing
into
these
sorts
of
projects
creates
preventable
waste
and
generates
violations
of
landowners
rights
when
the
people
done
wrong
by
hurried
government
appraisers
and
lawyers
are
rich
they
can
afford
to
sue
and
hold
out
for
something
approximating
just
compensation
it's
the
little
guys
families
living
on
modest
tracts
and
medium-large
ranching
and
agricultural
operations
that
look
rich
on
paper
but
actually
trade
in
razor-fine
profit
margins
who
end
up
screwed
for
good
part
of
the
problem
for
such
people
as
south
texas
locals
told
thinkprogress
in
the
spring
is
that
the
engineers
who
design
the
fences
often
don't
want
to
cling
tightly
to
the
river
itself
norie
garza
has
been
building
a
small
vacation
home
on
seven
riverfront
acres
for
most
of
the
past
decade
in
the
feds
showed
up
to
let
her
know
that
new
fencing
would
be
coming
in
behind
her
land
the
engineers
were
sympathetic
she
said
but
still
shoved
legal
papers
on
her
basically
you
sign
it
or
you
spend
thousands
of
dollars
fighting
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
still
have
to
allow
them
to
come
in
she
said
sugarcane
farmer
and
rancher
sam
sparks
iii
broadly
supports
the
idea
of
cracking
down
on
drug
traffickers
in
his
area
but
said
the
idea
you
can
both
secure
those
areas
and
keep
them
productive
for
the
families
who've
invested
years
of
sweat
and
millions
of
dollars
into
them
is
a
fiction
the
engineers
offer
to
put
in
security
gates
and
distribute
passcodes
so
people
like
sparks
who
had
about
half
his
family's
acre
holdings
cut
off
by
fencing
can
prevent
their
southern
acreage
turning
fallow
but
that's
no
solution
traffickers
are
gonna
target
those
people
that
have
that
code
without
a
doubt
sparks
said
even
if
he
were
the
type
to
arm
himself
and
keep
working
acreage
the
fencing
might
isolate
he
said
he'd
never
be
able
to
hire
workers
to
do
it
with
him
when
you
stretch
a
wall
across
that
property
then
for
sure
nobody
will
want
to
work
down
there
in
that
acres
because
then
you're
trapped
if
you
get
in
danger
there's
no
getting
away
he
said
we
need
the
protection
we've
gotta
stop
this
because
it's
gotten
out
of
hand
but
at
the
same
time
what
are
we
willing
to
sacrifice
in
the
name
of
doing
so
