trump
drops
support
for
enhanced
background
checks
two
weeks
after
mass
shootings
that
didn't
take
long
it
has
only
been
two
weeks
since
president
donald
trump
formally
addressed
the
nation
in
the
wake
of
deadly
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
dayton
ohio
and
gilroy
california
but
on
sunday
not
long
after
he
initially
showed
support
for
enhanced
background
checks
the
president
suddenly
reversed
course
suggesting
any
momentum
for
passing
any
meaningful
legislation
to
curb
gun
violence
may
have
already
dissipated
speaking
to
the
press
before
returning
to
washington
from
vacation
at
his
golf
resort
in
bedminster
new
jersey
trump
suggested
congress
had
been
considering
various
proposals
in
the
aftermath
of
those
shootings
but
said
he
is
primarily
concerned
about
mental
health
issues
and
insisted
that
the
country
needs
to
bring
back
mental
institutions
i'm
not
talking
about
as
a
form
of
prison
he
said
i'm
saying
for
help
he
added
that
unrelated
he
also
supported
voter
identification
laws
which
have
proven
to
serve
no
purpose
but
to
suppress
minority
votes
later
during
the
gaggle
a
reporter
pressed
trump
on
his
specific
position
on
background
checks
he
deferred
to
congress
and
defended
his
support
for
the
second
amendment
people
don't
realize
we
have
very
strong
background
checks
right
now
he
said
if
you
go
in
and
buy
a
gun
you
have
to
sign
up
there
are
a
lot
of
background
checks
that
have
been
approved
over
the
years
so
i'll
have
to
see
what
it
is
he
then
referred
once
more
to
a
big
mental
problem
asked
again
about
his
own
position
on
background
checks
trump
replied
i'm
not
saying
anything
this
is
just
the
latest
step
the
president
has
taken
to
downplay
expectations
on
gun
violence
prevention
measures
following
the
latest
round
of
mass
shootings
during
a
formal
address
to
the
nation
on
august
trump
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
only
realistic
solution
to
repeated
gun
violence
was
the
implementation
of
red
flag
laws
which
allow
law
enforcement
officials
to
temporarily
take
guns
from
people
expressing
threatening
language
the
president
at
the
time
was
reportedly
considering
using
executive
action
to
circumvent
congress
on
guns
a
flip-flop
from
his
past
opposition
to
such
a
move
though
what
might
be
included
in
that
executive
action
remained
a
mystery
the
national
rifle
association
strongly
opposes
any
additional
gun
control
measures
and
in
the
past
has
pressured
trump
to
bow
to
its
views
nra
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
reportedly
held
several
phone
calls
with
the
president
days
after
the
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
according
to
officials
who
spoke
with
the
washington
post
and
not
long
after
trump
tweeted
his
support
for
the
nra
assuring
them
that
their
very
strong
views
would
be
fully
represented
and
respected
the
president
also
deflated
hopes
of
reviving
an
assault
weapons
ban
falsely
claiming
that
there
is
no
political
appetite
for
that
at
this
moment
even
though
a
majority
of
the
country
supports
bringing
back
such
a
ban
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-ca
called
on
the
senate
this
month
to
return
early
from
its
august
recess
to
take
up
some
of
the
gun
reform
measures
previously
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
refused
saying
the
senate
would
take
up
the
issue
when
it
reconvened
in
september
pelosi
nevertheless
doubled
down
friday
on
her
calls
for
the
senate
to
return
earlier
than
planned
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
likewise
announced
it
would
do
just
that
reconvening
on
september
to
consider
a
set
of
bills
including
a
ban
on
high-capacity
magazines
the
committee
will
also
hold
a
hearing
on
september
to
discuss
military-style
assault
weapons
this
article
has
been
updated
to
state
that
trump
spoke
with
the
nra
following
the
el
paso
and
dayton
shootings
according
to
a
report
by
the
washington
post
