how
straight
pride
parades
like
the
one
in
boston
mask
a
far-right
agenda
anti-trans
hate
is
spreading
all
along
the
far-right
spectrum
during
pride
month
an
organization
with
ties
to
violent
hate
groups
super
happy
fun
america
announced
it
would
host
a
straight
pride
parade
in
boston
the
city
of
boston
approved
its
application
for
a
public
event
and
on
saturday
the
parade
will
take
place
at
noon
when
participants
will
march
from
copley
square
to
city
hall
plaza
then
they'll
host
a
rally
and
hold
a
flag-raising
ceremony
presumably
of
their
straight
pride
banner
on
the
event's
facebook
page
the
group
wrote
celebrate
the
diverse
history
culture
and
contributions
of
the
straight
community
the
straight
pride
event
will
be
held
to
achieve
inclusivity
and
spread
awareness
of
issues
impacting
straights
in
greater
boston
and
beyond
the
organizers
speak
about
straight
people
as
an
oppressed
group
extol
traditional
gender
roles
and
praise
straight
people
for
preventing
extinction
photos
they
have
shared
representing
straight
pride
are
predominantly
of
white
couples
and
families
this
narrative
of
victimhood
is
common
for
far
right
spaces
these
talking
points
range
from
outright
hatred
of
lgbtq
people
that
is
tied
to
what
white
supremacists
see
as
a
weakening
of
the
white
race
to
a
more
subtle
opposition
against
a
liberal
agenda
which
includes
any
celebration
of
lgbtq
people
trans
people
in
particular
are
increasingly
the
target
of
hate
by
far
right
groups
in
june
the
southern
poverty
law
center
released
a
report
on
hate
groups
ramping
up
their
demonization
of
trans
people
the
splc
said
white
supremacist
groups
are
using
more
violent
language
as
movements
for
trans
equality
become
more
visible
and
support
for
transgender
rights
grows
for
instance
neo-nazi
christopher
cantwell
wrote
on
telegram
recently
that
assisted
suicide
is
the
only
help
you
can
give
trannies
and
daily
stormer
editor
andrew
anglin
encouraged
trans
people
to
kill
themselves
last
year
but
it's
not
just
neo-nazi
and
white
nationalist
figures
on
the
far
right
who
have
become
also
become
more
vocally
transphobic
according
to
the
splc
report
figures
on
both
the
alt-right
as
well
as
the
alt-lite
try
to
couch
their
transphobia
in
humor
or
frame
the
fight
for
trans
equality
as
out-of-control
political
correctness
the
alt-right
according
to
the
anti-defamation
league
rejects
mainstream
conservatism
in
favor
of
politics
that
embrace
implicit
or
explicit
racist
anti-semitic
and
white
supremacist
ideology
the
alt-lite
tends
to
shy
away
from
the
expression
of
outright
white
supremacist
views
but
are
in
step
with
the
alt
right
in
their
hatred
of
feminists
and
immigrants
among
others
the
organization
says
it
tends
to
focus
on
political
correctness
and
identity
politics
resist
marxism
a
group
that
organizers
are
tied
to
is
one
example
of
an
alt-lite
group
oren
segal
the
director
of
the
anti-defamation
league's
center
on
extremism
said
this
year's
pride
celebration
in
detroit
where
armed
neo-nazis
met
parade-goers
with
homophobic
slurs
was
intended
to
gather
momentum
and
backing
for
their
extremist
worldview
those
neo-nazis
were
part
of
the
national
socialist
movement
which
the
southern
poverty
law
center
has
said
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
prominent
neo-nazi
groups
in
the
united
states
there
has
been
another
attempt
to
host
a
straight
pride
parades
but
it
was
largely
unsuccessful
last
week
in
modesto
california
the
national
straight
pride
coalition
organized
a
straight
pride
rally
which
drew
about
participants
and
a
much
larger
number
of
counter
protesters
many
more
people
came
to
protest
the
event
the
organizer
of
the
modesto
rally
don
grundmann
defended
his
coalition
as
a
totally
peaceful
racist
group
a
description
offered
without
a
hint
of
irony
hardcore
white
supremacists
and
their
animosity
toward
the
lgbtq
community
is
established
segal
said
you
also
have
these
virulent
online
communities
that
peddle
in
white
supremacist
ideas
that
glorify
violence
that
seek
to
normalize
anti-lgbtq
sentiments
which
has
a
large
impact
as
well
he
continued
many
people
are
absorbing
this
online
and
getting
their
worldview
out
there
which
is
a
problem
with
many
issues
including
this
but
then
there's
a
set
of
groups
that
don't
fit
neatly
into
white
supremacy
that
people
have
called
the
alt-right
and
a
movement
is
more
alt-lite
which
also
has
an
agenda
opposed
to
pc
culture
liberalism
multicultural
feminism
and
that
also
often
results
in
the
demonization
of
the
lgbtq
community
segal
added
said
straight
pride
parades
are
not
unlike
the
right's
embrace
of
the
phrase
white
lives
matter
and
are
meant
to
convey
that
the
view
that
oppressed
groups
should
not
be
afforded
special
status
and
as
with
many
far-right
agendas
they
make
frequent
use
of
memes
and
try
to
mask
their
hate
with
levity
whether
it's
hardcore
extremists
whether
it's
the
alt-lite
types
it's
an
effort
to
promote
their
agenda
through
humor
and
irony
in
many
ways
there
are
elements
of
this
event
that
seem
like
a
trolling
attempt
he
said
although
the
parade's
name
and
memes
focus
on
sexuality
and
not
gender
one
of
the
organizers
has
said
that
he
doesn't
want
kids
to
be
taught
that
gender
is
something
that
is
determined
by
each
individual
a
statement
that
appeared
to
conflate
gender
and
sexual
orientation
samson
racioppi
one
of
the
organizers
complained
to
the
boston
globe
about
a
netflix
show
featuring
drag
queens
and
a
friend's
preteen
daughter
thinking
about
her
gender
he
said
that
straight
people
have
been
disregarded
and
felt
the
program
to
be
a
form
of
attack
people
need
to
be
reassured
that
even
though
there's
all
this
mixed
messaging
it's
still
perfectly
natural
to
identify
as
a
heterosexual
he
said
another
of
the
organizers
mark
sahady
with
the
group
resist
marxism
was
seen
on
video
grabbing
a
trans
woman
at
the
boston
women's
march
in
january
a
group
called
solidarity
against
hate-boston
which
is
staging
a
counter-demonstration
on
saturday
flagged
resist
marxism
in
a
statement
in
june
rm
is
an
attempt
to
emulate
the
right-wing
violence
culture
on
the
west
coast
they
have
failed
because
we've
met
them
with
overwhelming
numbers
of
counterprotesters
it
wrote
even
then
they've
been
violent
choking
shoving
punching
they
have
tried
to
disrupt
dsa
democratic
socialists
of
america
meetings
trans
rights
rallies
immigration
rights
rallies
that
things
haven't
gotten
more
violent
is
a
testimony
to
the
work
people
in
the
city
have
done
to
counter
these
actions
and
rm's
own
incompetence
solidarity
against
hate-boston
said
sahady
also
has
ties
to
groups
like
the
proud
boys
the
new
hampshire
american
guard
and
the
massachusetts
patriot
front
the
proud
boys
group
which
has
assaulted
antifascists
also
has
engaged
in
transphobic
speech
gavin
mcinnes
who
founded
the
group
but
claims
to
have
left
it
in
has
called
trans
people
mentally
ill
gays
who
need
help
and
that
doesn't
include
being
maimed
by
physicians
and
gender
use
of
the
n-word
sahady
himself
has
used
violent
rhetoric
like
many
far-right
figures
he
appeared
to
refer
to
chilean
dictator
augusto
pinochet
who
killed
at
least
political
dissidents
by
throwing
them
from
helicopters
and
suggested
that
republicans
should
throw
anti-american
communists
out
of
helicopters
during
the
rally
for
free
speech
in
july
that
was
planned
by
the
proud
boys
and
several
far-right
personalities
brandon
sullivan
who
was
seen
with
super
happy
fun
america
reportedly
threatened
black
lives

protesters
and
punched
an
antifascist
ahead
of
a
central
maine
pride
festival
event
held
in

in
waterville
maine
resist

posted
on
facebook
attention
patriots
in
maine
to
let
people
know
that
a
drag
queen
planned
to
come
in
and
read
children's
books
it
has
been
a
common
tactic
among
the
far
right
to
disrupt
drag
queen
story
hour
events
like
this
one
drag
queen
story
hour
is
a
national
program
which
aims
to
capture
the
imagination
and
play
of
the
gender
fluidity
of
childhood
and
gives
kids
glamorous
positive
and
unabashedly
queer
role
models
according
to
the
southern
poverty
law
center
white
nationalist
paul
nehlen
urged
his
followers
to
get
photos
of
all
the
degenerate
parents
who
take
their
kids
to
this
filth
get
their
license
plates
anything
else
you
can
segal
said
that
alt-lite
and
alt-right
groups
and
speech
can
lead
people
to
more
extreme
white
supremacist
spaces
i
think
in
some
ways
groups
like
resist
marxism
the
proud
boys
and
other
groups
like
them
are
sort
of
a
gateway
into
more
extreme
groups
we
consider
proud
boys
to
be
an
extremist
group
because
of
the
violence
that
has
been
associated
with
them
segal
said
people
don't
tend
to
just
flip
a
switch
and
become
white
supremacists
so
the
normalization
of
hateful
tropes
whether
it's
anti-semitism
or
anti-immigrant
sentiment
or
anti-lgbtq
sentiment
those
who
embrace
that
get
one
step
closer
to
the
more
extreme
views
anti-feminist
and
anti-lgbtq
views
tend
to
go
hand-in-hand
on
the
far
right
a
religious
far
right
group
patriot
prayer
which
proud
boys
has
provided
security
for
has
also
engaged
in
transphobia
last
year
patriot
prayer
organized
a
rally
called
himtoo
in
response
to
what
they
called
false
rape
allegations
which
engaged
in
misogynistic
and
anti-trans
language
the
adl's
segal
said
that
all
forms
of
bigotry
need
to
be
considered
when
looking
at
people's
radicalization
into
extremist
groups
much
like
the
red
pill
movement
a
group
associated
with
anti-feminist
and
misogynist
views
men's
rights
activists
and
incels
or
involuntary
celibates
can
help
usher
people
into
more
far-right
spaces
so
can
transphobia
and
the
idea
that
cis
and
straight
people
are
oppressed
by
the
lgbtq
community
when
we're
looking
at
extremist
groups
we
tend
to
look
at
racism
and
anti-semitism
and
other
forms
of
bigotry
and
misogyny
tends
to
be
overlooked
as
an
indicator
that
someone
is
going
down
that
path
of
radicalization
he
said
i
think
absolutely
the
same
is
true
for
those
who
engage
in
transphobic
speech
or
anti-lgbtq
sentiment
more
broadly
these
are
all
forms
of
hatred
that
are
not
only
embraced
by
the
extreme
but
that
they
rely
on
to
attract
the
next
generation
of
followers
segal
said
that's
why
it's
so
important
for
people
to
speak
out
against
these
forms
of
hatred
