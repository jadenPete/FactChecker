being
sued
for
sexual
predation
claims
california
is
too
weak
on
crime
curtis
hill
says
accountability
for
your
conduct
is
the
definition
of
being
an
american
indiana's
republican
attorney
general
curtis
hill
went
on
fox
news
monday
to
complain
that
california
is
not
doing
enough
to
hold
lawbreakers
accountable
hill
is
currently
being
sued
by
four
women
for
alleged
sexual
predation
a
special
prosecutor
found
the
claims
against
him
credible
hill
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
over
the
weekend
hill
penned
a
fox
news
op-ed
blaming
homelessness
in
california
on
the
state's
treatment
of
non-violent
crimes
like
drug
use
as
misdemeanors
instead
of
felonies
on
monday
he
joined
fox
friends
to
promote
the
piece
and
reiterate
his
attacks
on
a
state
nearly
miles
away
from
his
own
in
his
interview
he
was
asked
about
a
quote
from
president
ronald
reagan
that
he
mentioned
in
his
op-ed
we
must
reject
the
idea
that
every
time
a
law's
broken
society
is
guilty
rather
than
the
lawbreaker
it
is
time
to
restore
the
american
precept
that
each
individual
is
accountable
for
his
actions
that's
one
of
my
favorite
quotes
of
all
time
hill
beamed
because
it
really
speaks
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
what
it
means
to
be
an
american
accountability
for
your
conduct
hill
also
urged
california
to
undo
its
criminal
justice
reforms
s
imply
reducing
sentences
cutting
sentences
pretending
that
criminal
conduct
isn't
occurring
or
watching
criminal
conduct
occur
but
changing
the
definition
so
we
no
longer
think
it
is
criminal
conduct
or
counting
it
as
a
score
that
doesn't
work
we
need
to
make
sure
we
hold
people
accountable
for
smaller
offenses
he
said
california
has
one
of
the
lowest
rates
of
drug
use
in
the
united
states
indiana
has
the
fifth
highest
hill
as
noted
previously
is
currently
the
subject
of
a
lawsuit
from
four
women
accusing
him
of
sexual
predation
the
four
plaintiffs
a
bipartisan
group
of
statehouse
staffers
allege
that
hill
groped
them
at
a
march
party
an
investigation
by
indiana's
inspector
general
found
multiple
eyewitnesses
from
both
parties
who
said
hill's
conduct
had
been
inappropriate
creepy
and
unwelcome
after
a
special
prosecutor
appointed
to
examine
the
matter
found
the
claims
credible
but
said
he
lacked
the
required
evidence
of
intent
needed
to
prove
battery
the
women
filed
their
federal
suit
in
june
accusing
hill
of
sexual
harassment
retaliation
gender
discrimination
battery
defamation
and
invasion
of
privacy
hill
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
hill
has
been
a
frequent
adviser
to
president
donald
trump
on
law
enforcement
issues
and
has
been
lauded
by

pence
for
working
very
closely
with
our
administration
in
that
area
