trump
speaks
out
against
shootings
by
reinforcing
his
own
racist
immigration
policies
republicans
and
democrats
must
come
together
and
get
strong
background
checks
perhaps
marrying
this
legislation
with
desperately
needed
immigration
reform
president
donald
trump
on
monday
suggested
he
may
hold
gun
violence
prevention
measures
hostage
to
furthering
his
racist
agenda
on
immigration
in
the
wake
of
two
deadly
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
while
investigations
have
not
yet
clearly
discerned
the
motives
in
each
of
the
recent
shootings
the
alleged
shooter
who
killed
in
el
paso
is
believed
to
be
the
author
of
a
manifesto
published
on
chan
touting
white
nationalism
xenophobia
and
anti-hispanic
racism
many
on
social
media
also
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
what
is
believed
to
be
the
suspected
gunman's
twitter
account
he
had
liked
a
photo
of
the
word
trump
spelled
out
with
firearms
both
the
alleged
gunmen
in
el
paso
and
dayton
were
white
men
despite
this
trump
tweeted
monday
morning
that
his
support
for
legislation
such
as
requiring
background
checks
for
gun
purchasers
may
be
conditioned
on
taking
up
his
anti-immigration
policies
we
cannot
let
those
killed
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
die
in
vain
likewise
for
those
so
seriously
wounded
we
can
never
forget
them
and
those
many
who
came
before
them
he
wrote
republicans
and
democrats
must
come
together
and
get
strong
background
checks
perhaps
marrying
this
legislation
with
desperately
needed
immigration
reform
we
must
have
something
good
if
not
great
come
out
of
these
two
tragic
events
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
trump
held
the
country
hostage
to
advance
a
xenophobic
agenda
at
the
end
of
last
year
trump
was
so
insistent
that
his
border
wall
be
funded
by
the
american
people
that
he
allowed
the
government
to
be
shutdown
for
a
record
days
he
later
declared
a
national
emergency
at
the
border
to
empower
himself
to
circumvent
congress
his
administration
is
also
reportedly
considering
reducing
the
number
of
refugee
admissions
to
zero
next
year
essentially
closing
the
border
to
those
fleeing
for
their
lives
trump
has
stoked
racist
sentiments
throughout
his
presidency
but
particularly
in
recent
weeks
with
multiple
attacks
on
nonwhite
members
of
congress
he
took
no
responsibility
for
his
own
rhetoric
and
instead
lashed
out
at
the
fake
news
media
accusing
it
of
stirring
anger
and
rage
in
his
alleged
manifesto
the
suspected
el
paso
gunman
also
complained
of
fake
news
in
addition
to
telling
four
congresswomen
of
color
to
go
back
to
the
countries
they
came
from
the
president
stood
by
at
a
recent
rally
as
supporters
chanted
send
her
back
in
reaction
to
his
comments
about
somali-born
u.s.
rep
ilhan
omar
d-mn
who
immigrated
to
the
united
states
as
a
child
he
has
attacked
both
maryland
rep
elijah
cummings
d
who
is
black
calling
cummings
home
district
in
baltimore
a
rat-infested
disgusting
place
and
has
attacked
cummings
supporters
including
rev
al
sharpton
by
suggesting
falsely
that
sharpton
hates
whites
cops
the
president
notably
launched
his
presidential
campaign
by
claiming
immigration
crackdowns
were
necessary
because
mexicans
were
rapists
and
murderers
he
has
frequently
claimed
that
caravans
of
refugees
are
trying
to
invade
the
country
something
the
suspected
el
paso
shooter
allegedly
mentioned
in
his
racist
manifesto
trump
by
contrast
has
repeatedly
assured
his
supporters
at
campaign
rallies
that
he
will
protect
the
second
amendment
a
year
after
the
las
vegas
shooting
that
killed
people
the
trump
administration
did
finally
take
the
step
of
banning
bump
stocks
a
ban
that
took
effect
this
past
march
but
it's
unclear
just
how
far
the
administration
is
actually
willing
to
go
in
terms
of
supporting
other
measures
that
would
create
barriers
to
gun
purchases
and
usage
