here's
how
trump's
greenland
plans
fit
in
a
long
history
of
u.s.
island
imperialism
if
you
want
to
look
for
a
precedent
examine
how
the
u.s.
forcibly
annexed
hawaii
one
of
the
most
unexpected
turns
of
donald
trump's
presidency
came
this
week
when
revelations
spilled
out
about
the
president's
serious
consideration
of
the
purchase
greenland
from
denmark
according
to
the
washington
post
senior
administration
officials
mulled
possibly
offering
some
million
in
annual
subsidies
to
the
danish
territory
alongside
a
large
one-time
payment
to
denmark
for
the
transfer
trump
even
joked
about
trying
to
swap
greenland
for
puerto
rico
the
latter
of
which
remains
an
american
territory
the
idea
at
least
as
of
right
now
remains
a
farce
and
isn't
yet
a
tragedy
however
there's
a
clear
historic
legacy
trump's
tapped
into
one
that
reaches
directly
into
america's
gilded
age
of
imperialism
buttressed
by
clear
strains
of
white
supremacy
and
neo-colonialism
greenland
after
all
would
be
far
from
the
first
island
acquisition
washington
lawmakers
havs
pursued
during
the
s
the
u.s.
began
its
run
of
island-based
imperialism
through
a
series
of
annexations
of
so-called
guano
islands
a
series
of
caribbean
and
pacific
outposts
washington
could
use
to
harvest
guano
bird
droppings
as
fertilizer
over
the
years
the
portfolio
of
islands
continued
to
accrue
an
agreement
with
germany
brought
the
american
samoa
island
chain
to
the
u.s.
the
spanish-american
war
landed
the
u.s.
puerto
rico
the
philippines
and
guam
and
while
american
attempts
stemming
especially
those
based
out
of
the
slave-holding
south
to
annex
cuba
eventually
faltered
the
u.s.
managed
to
further
cement
its
caribbean
holdings
with
the
purchase
of
the
u.s.
virgin
islands
in
none
of
these
holdings
of
course
came
with
the
consent
of
the
governed
rather
they
were
the
fruits
of
agreements
between
washington
and
madrid
or
washington
and
berlin
or
washington
and
copenhagen
and
that
lack
of
consent
from
local
populations
immediately
and
sometimes
violently
manifested
itself
the
american
acquisition
of
the
philippines
for
instance
rapidly
morphed
into
the
so-called
philippine
insurrection
a
filipino
war
for
independence
in
essence
as
the
most
careful
study
of
the
american-filipino
war
found
about
filipinos
died
because
of
the
war
with
americans
torturing
and
setting
up
concentration
camps
for
filipinos
along
the
way
not
that
there
would
have
been
much
reason
to
consent
to
american
annexation
at
the
time
after
all
puerto
ricans
had
to
wait
nearly
twenty
years
to
obtain
formal
american
citizenship
while
those
in
guam
annexed
to
the
u.s.
only
when
americans
explained
to
their
spanish
counterparts
on
the
island
that
washington
and
madrid
were
in
fact
at
war
had
to
wait
over
a
half-century
for
american
citizenship
to
finally
come
to
them
and
american
samoans
are
still
waiting
there's
no
indication
greenlanders
would
be
any
different
with
the
island
moving
toward
ever-greater
autonomy
from
denmark
the
likely
next
step
for
greenland
would
be
outright
independence
rather
than
american
territorial
status
as
paul
musgrave
recently
wrote
in
foreign
policy
right
now
there's
reason
to
think
that
greenland
may
well
be
on
a
path
to
full
independence
not
simply
switching
one
protectorate
for
another
and
as
others
have
pointed
the
move
to
sell
the
territory
to
washington
would
be
akin
to
the
u.s.
auctioning
off
say
texas
or
arizona
to
the
highest
bidder
without
residents
consent
none
of
these
incidents
of
island
imperialism
though
are
comparable
to
the
egregious
conquest
the
u.s.
brought
about
in
its
best-known
island
annexation
to
date
hawaii
by
the
early
th
century
the
hawaiian
kingdom
was
already
warding
off
multiple
western
colonizing
powers
all
eager
to
access
the
islands
the
appeal
was
easy
to
see
not
only
did
hawaii's
position
in
the
central
pacific
present
an
ideal
location
for
everything
from
whaling
ships
to
coaling
stations
but
its
climate
proved
fruitful
for
a
sugar
industry
that
in
time
blossomed
into
one
of
the
world's
greatest
as
such
french
german
british
and
russian
diplomats
eyed
the
islands
as
a
potential
jewel
in
a
pacific
crown
all
of
these
countries
it's
worth
noting
recognized
hawaii
as
a
sovereign
independent
nation
as
did
the
u.s.
lorenz
gonschor
who
received
his
doctorate
at
the
university
of
hawaii
told
thinkprogress
that
dozens
of
countries
carried
on
diplomatic
relations
with
hawaii
far
outpacing
other
nominally
independent
north
american
regions
like
texas
still
those
diplomatic
relations
did
little
to
stop
the
u.s.
from
pursuing
annexation
regardless
of
how
native
hawaiians
felt
by
american
missionaries
and
businessmen
had
accrued
sufficient
power
that
backed
by
an
armed
militia
they
managed
to
force
the
hawaiian
monarch
to
rewrite
the
country's
constitution
the
so-called
bayonet
constitution
earned
its
name
from
the
fact
that
the
hawaiian
monarch
was
forced
as
national
geographic
wrote
to
consent
to
the
new
constitution
at
gunpoint
it
was
added
historian
steven
hahn
a
successful
coup
one
that
was
finalized
with
the
goal
of
annexation
in
mind
a
few
years
later
the
process
continued
as
the
university
of
hawaii's
davianna
mcgregor
wrote
american
minister
john
stevens
conspired
in
with
a
small
group
of
non-hawaiian
residents
of
hawaii
including
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
overthrow
the
indigenous
and
lawful
government
of
hawaii
stevens
and
a
u.s.
naval
representative
sent
over
armed
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
to
invade
the
sovereign
hawaiian
nation
with
the
u.s.
then
proceeding
to
recognize
the
conspirators
as
hawaii's
lawful
government
the
new
government
ignored
u.s.
president
grover
cleveland's
request
to
restore
hawaii's
monarch
queen
lili
uokalani
to
the
throne
instead
they
forced
her
to
sign
a
statement
of
abdication
a
statement
she
later
renounced
shortly
thereafter
a
massive
petition
drive
began
circulating
among
native
hawaiians
opposing
american
annexation
thousands
of
native
hawaiians
put
their
names
forward
resist
american
acquisition
as
julia
siler
wrote
in
lost
kingdom
her
overview
of
the
annexation
the
vast
majority
of
native
hawaiians
signed
the
petition
many
of
them
don
ning
black
armbands
in
protest
but
by
then
the
momentum
toward
american
annexation
was
impossible
to
slow
in
washington
annexation
fever
buoyed
by
outright
white
supremacy
gripped
the
capital
as
teddy
roosevelt
thundered
we
ought
to
take
hawaii
in
the
interests
of
the
white
race
in
the
americans
formalized
their
annexation
of
the
islands
holding
a
formal
transfer
ceremony
in
hawaii
itself
but
even
that
event
came
with
clear
opposition
from
the
native
population
as
one
observer
said
the
band
of
native
hawaiians
slated
to
perform
at
the
event
threw
away
their
instruments
and
fled
around
the
corner
out
of
sight
and
hearing
some
wept
audibly
and
were
not
ashamed
all
told
added
siler
million
acres
of
land
now
worth
billions
of
dollars
was
seized
from
native
hawaiians
and
claimed
by
american
businessmen
hawaiians
lost
their
country
the
first
sovereign
nation
to
become
a
casualty
of
america's
imperial
outreach
the
rank
imperialism
behind
the
annexation
though
was
too
much
for
some
even
in
washington
to
stomach
as
cleveland
would
write
hawaii
is
ours
as
i
contemplate
the
means
used
to
complete
the
outrage
i
am
ashamed
of
the
whole
affair
back
in
hawaii
the
outrage
was
just
as
tangible
yet
again
in
a
nod
to
trump's
musings
about
purchasing
greenland
without
any
consent
of
greenlanders
america
had
annexed
a
series
of
islands
without
bothering
to
ask
the
inhabitants
for
their
thoughts
might
to
washington
at
least
made
right
as
the
deposed
hawaiian
queen
would
write
time
may
wear
off
the
feeling
of
injury
by
and
by
but
my
dear
flag
the
hawaiian
flag
that
a
strange
flag
should
wave
over
it
may
heaven
look
down
on
these
americans
responsible
and
punish
them
for
their
deeds
