donald
trump
has
an
ethanol
problem
trump
doesn't
have
farmers
support
like
he
thinks
he
does
president
donald
trump
often
boasts
that
u.s.
farmers
are
on
his
side
but
a
tweet
thursday
indicates
he
recognizes
the
need
for
more
damage
control
what's
unclear
is
if
his
new
promises
will
even
begin
to
mitigate
the
harm
he's
already
done
to
farmers
income
the
farmers
are
going
to
be
so
happy
when
they
see
what
we
are
doing
for
ethanol
trump
insisted
it
will
be
a
giant
package
get
ready
he
boasted
that
he's
also
been
able
to
save
the
small
refineries
from
certain
closing
the
tweet
follows
numerous
decisions
by
the
trump
administration
that
have
dramatically
hurt
farmers
not
only
have
farmers
faced
the
consequences
of
the
tariffs
in
trump's
trade
war
with
china
but
his
administration
also
announced
this
month
a
new
round
of
waivers
for
oil
refineries
to
not
have
to
include
ethanol
in
their
production
the
renewable
fuel
standard
requires
that
oil
refineries
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
as
a
result
of
corn
grown
in
the
united
states
is
turned
into
ethanol
since
taking
office
however
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
has
been
issuing
waivers
to
to
small
oil
refineries
relieving
them
of
this
ethanol
requirement
prior
to
this
month
it
had
issued
such
waivers
and
it
has
just
issued
another
as
a
result
demand
for
ethanol
has
plummeted
by
an
estimated
billion
gallons
and
the
epa
has
so
far
decided
not
to
raise
the
annual
target
for
how
much
corn
ethanol
will
be
blended
into
gasoline
meaning
the
demand
won't
change
the
oil
industry
unsurprisingly
opposes
any
efforts
to
bolster
ethanol
the
waivers
have
been
great
for
oil
refineries
but
terrible
for
ethanol
refineries
which
have
also
suffered
from
the
reduced
demand
since
trump's
epa
started
issuing
the
waivers
ethanol
plants
have
shut
down
or
idled
including
one
in
minnesota
just
this
week
and
one
in
indiana
last
week
that's
resulted
in
a
loss
of
more
than
jobs
whatever
trump
proposes
in
this
new
giant
package
will
have
to
compensate
for
all
of
these
losses
on
top
of
damage
that's
already
been
done
by
the
trade
war
tariffs
in
an
interview
with
msnbc
shortly
after
trump
posted
his
tweet
thursday
roger
johnson
of
the
national
farmers
union
highlighted
just
how
little
the
president's
subsidies
will
compensate
for
farmers
losses
net
farm
income's
been
down
in
the
area
of
billion
dollars
johnson
explained
and
so
these
payments
billion
billion
yes
they're
needed
they're
important
but
they're
not
going
to
make
up
for
the
damage
and
this
damage
is
long-term
it's
going
to
be
decades
literally
before
we
get
some
of
these
markets
back
if
ever
with
many
farmers
who
voted
for
trump
in
now
saying
they're
so
exasperated
that
they
can't
currently
support
him
his
giant
package
has
an
incredible
amount
of
damage
to
undo
