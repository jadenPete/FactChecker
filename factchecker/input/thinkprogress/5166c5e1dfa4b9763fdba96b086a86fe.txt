bolsonaro
says
the
fires
in
the
amazon
are
all
the
fault
of
ngos
it's
a
move
straight
from
the
authoritarian
playbook
far-right
brazilian
president
jair
bolsonaro
followed
the
authoritarian
playbook
when
he
claimed
without
evidence
that
non-governmental
organizations
and
environmental
groups
caused
the
forest
fires
currently
destroying
large
swathes
of
the
amazon
rainforest
on
the
question
of
burning
in
the
amazon
which
in
my
opinion
may
have
been
initiated
by
ngos
because
they
lost
money
what
is
the
intention
to
bring
problems
to
brazil
bolsonaro
said
on
wednesday
in
a
facebook
live
broadcast
later
that
day
he
added
that
everything
indicates
that
ngos
wanted
to
set
fire
to
the
amazon
he
then
admitted
that
he
had
no
evidence
to
back
up
the
claims
bolsonaro's
statements
are
of
course
a
lie
while
it's
difficult
to
trace
the
precise
cause
of
the
nearly
fires
currently
burning
in
the
amazon
his
far-right
administration
has
empowered
ranchers
loggers
and
farmers
to
clear
land
for
their
own
benefit
destroying
huge
swathes
of
the
rainforest
in
the
process
as
the
huffington
post
noted
after
his
inauguration
bolsonaro
appointed
a
foreign
minister
who
said
that
climate
change
was
a
leftist
ideology
an
environment
minister
who
questioned
whether
humans
contributed
to
climate
change
and
shifted
oversight
of
indigenous
reservations
to
the
ministry
of
agriculture
which
is
allied
with
the
agribusiness
lobby
the
indigenous
population
of
the
amazon
already
severely
at
risk
because
of
bolsonaro's
genocidal
policies
has
been
hardest
hit
by
brazil's
poor
stewardship
of
the
environment
armed
groups
have
staged
attacks
on
indigenous
communities
cutting
down
trees
planting
grass
and
starting
fires
to
allow
large
businesses
and
criminal
enterprises
to
encroach
on
their
land
a
video
went
viral
on
wednesday
showing
an
indigenous
patax
woman
near
tears
as
she
explained
how
land
on
her
reservation
had
been
set
on
fire
to
make
way
for
cattle
ranching
it's
hard
to
overstate
just
how
dangerous
the
destruction
of
the
amazon
is
for
the
entire
world
containing
percent
of
the
world's
rainforest
and
percent
of
the
world's
biodiversity
it
effectively
acts
as
the
world's
lungs
and
is
vital
to
any
chance
of
fighting
back
against
global
climate
change
scientists
are
terrified
that
the
sharp
rise
in
forest
fires
and
the
dramatic
increase
in
deforestation
there's
been
an
increase
since
last
year
and
the
clearing
of
forested
land
hit
a
new
monthly
record
of
sq
km
in
july
would
lead
to
an
unrecoverable
tipping
point
after
which
the
amazon
would
lose
its
water-recycling
capability
and
change
from
a
rainforest
into
a
savannah
severely
diminishing
its
ability
to
absorb
carbon
there
are
a
number
of
tipping
points
which
are
not
far
away
we
can't
see
exactly
where
they
are
but
we
know
they
are
very
close
philip
fearnside
a
professor
at
brazil's
national
institute
of
amazonian
research
told
the
guardian
it
means
that
we
have
to
do
things
right
away
unfortunately
that
is
not
what
is
happening
there
are
people
denying
we
even
have
a
problem
bolsonaro's
strategy
of
blaming
ngos
for
the
fallout
from
his
own
ecologically
disastrous
policies
echoes
similar
moves
made
by
other
authoritarians
in
after
his
return
to
the
russian
presidency
vladimir
putin
launched
a
crackdown
on
ngos
in
russia
requiring
them
to
register
as
foreign
agents
in
he
went
on
to
accuse
ngos
of
creating
dissent
in
ukraine
which
led
to
the
ousting
of
ukrainian
president
viktor
yanukovich
we
will
not
accept
a
situation
like
what
happened
in
ukraine
putin
said
in
many
cases
it
was
through
non-governmental
organizations
that
nationalist
militants
and
neo-nazi
groups
which
become
the
shock
troops
in
the
anti-constitutional
coup
d'etat
received
funding
from
abroad
similiarly
authoritarian
president
rodrigo
duterte
of
the
philippines
has
claimed
that
ngos
obstructed
justice
in
his
war
on
drugs
which
has
left
thousands
dead
at
the
hands
of
police
and
paramilitary
death
squads
in
duterte
instructed
police
to
shoot
anyone
who
obstructed
police
business
even
if
they
included
human
rights
or
ngo
workers
shoot
those
who
are
part
of
drug
activity
duterte
said
if
they
members
of
human
rights
organizations
are
obstructing
justice
you
shoot
them
