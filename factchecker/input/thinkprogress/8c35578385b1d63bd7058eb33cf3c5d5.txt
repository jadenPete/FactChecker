a
battle
to
give
african
americans
political
power
is
playing
out
in
mississippi's
courts
a
fight
against
racist
laws
intended
to
prevent
black
people
from
being
seated
in
the
state
legislature
and
from
holding
statewide
office
mississippi's
long-standing
laws
that
prevent
african
americans
from
voting
or
assuming
political
power
are
being
challenged
in
the
courts
on
several
fronts
the
state's
population
is
african
american
the
highest
percentage
in
the
country
but
its
laws
are
designed
to
make
it
harder
for
people
of
color
to
win
statewide
office
formerly
incarcerated
people
find
it
all
but
impossible
to
vote
once
they
leave
prison
and
laws
in
the
state
specifically
limit
black
mississippians
representation
in
the
state
legislature
but
ahead
of
a
consequential
governor's
race
that
could
affect
the
state's
redistricting
process
in
those
laws
are
all
being
challenged
in
the
courts
mississippi's
african
american
voting
bloc
could
prove
even
more
critical
than
usual
this
november
the
state's
four-term
attorney
general
jim
hood
has
a
shot
at
winning
the
state's
gubernatorial
seat
in
the
general
election
against
either
lt
gov
tate
reeves
or
former
state
supreme
court
justice
bill
waller
who
face
off
in
a
republican
primary
runoff
election
this
month
the
race
for
governor
will
have
major
impact
on
whether
republicans
gain
complete
control
over
the
redistricting
process
and
unchecked
authority
to
redraw
racially
divided
districts
as
they
did
in
those
legislative
district
lines
are
currently
being
challenged
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
the
lawsuit
was
filed
on
behalf
of
three
african
american
residents
of
one
of
the
state's
racially
drawn
senate
districts
and
a
former
state
senator
who
was
unseated
in
after
the
new
maps
moved
him
into
the
gerrymandered
district
the
lawsuit
argues
that
the
state
legislature
diluted
the
voting
strength
of
lower-income
african
americans
in
the
district
by
mixing
in
wealthy
white
sections
of
a
neighboring
county
according
to
the
skanner
news
but
arguably
the
most
consequential
legal
challenges
are
to
mississippi's
racist
jim
crow-era
constitution
which
explicitly
intended
to
block
the
african
american
vote
and
give
whites
permanent
power
some
aspects
of
the
constitution
were
struck
down
by
the
supreme
court
and
the
voting
rights
act
including
poll
taxes
and
literacy
tests
along
with
a
clause
that
exempted
most
white
people
from
being
subjected
to
either
lawmakers
at
the
time
created
a
constitution
that
would
consolidate
political
power
with
white
people
in
mississippi
by
systematically
disenfranchising
black
people
in
mississippi
said
paloma
wu
senior
staff
attorney
at
the
southern
poverty
law
center
it
was
extremely
effective
at
what
it
was
headlined
to
do
which
was
to
achieve
white
political
power
on
the
basis
of
white
supremacy
the
constitution
created
election
rules
that
attempts
to
give
a
decided
advantage
to
white
candidates
vying
for
statewide
office
winners
of
statewide
office
in
mississippi
have
to
clear
two
hurdles
they
not
only
have
to
win
a
majority
of
the
state's
popular
vote
but
a
majority
of
house
districts
as
well
lawmakers
get
to
pick
a
winner
if
a
candidate
fails
to
satisfy
both
criteria
since
the
constitution
was
enacted
no
african
american
has
ever
been
elected
to
a
statewide
office
but
a
group
of
four
african
american
voters
represented
by
a
foundation
affiliated
with
former
attorney
general
eric
holder's
national
democratic
redistricting
committee
challenged
the
racist
election
rules
in
federal
court
in
may
the
lawsuit
argues
that
mississippi's
electoral
system
violates
the
th
and
th
amendments
of
the
u.s.
constitution
that
gave
black
americans
the
right
to
citizenship
and
the
right
to
vote
as
well
as
the
voting
rights
act
that
banned
discriminatory
voting
laws
mississippi
has
defended
the
election
rules
claiming
the
lawsuit
is
all
about
partisan
politics
and
not
protecting
the
voting
rights
according
to
the
starkville
daily
news
mississippi's
constitution
also
issued
lifetime
voting
bans
on
people
who
were
convicted
of
a
number
of
arbitrary
felonies
that
at
the
time
were
considered
to
most
likely
ensnare
african
americans
for
crimes
like
timber
larceny
and
writing
a
bad
check
regaining
the
vote
requires
a
lengthy
and
complicated
process
in
which
both
chambers
of
the
state
legislature
need
to
approve
restoration
of
the
voting
rights
and
even
then
return
of
the
franchise
is
subject
to
a
veto
by
the
governor
the
splc
and
the
law
firm
simpson
thacher
bartlett
challenged
the
state's
lifetime
ban
in
federal
court
last
year
the
lawsuit
argued
the
lifetime
ban
constituted
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
the
re-enfranchisement
legislative
process
violated
a
person's
first
amendment
right
to
political
expression
and
was
intended
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
on
wednesday
a
federal
judge
allowed
mississippi's
laws
to
stand
but
allowed
for
the
splc
to
challenge
the
discriminatory
intent
of
the
voter
restoration
legislative
process
in
a
trial
and
appeal
the
other
parts
of
the
court's
ruling
at
a
higher
court
it's
not
just
mississippi's
laws
that
are
racist
a
number
of
mississippi's
most
powerful
politicians
have
a
long
history
of
racial
bias
especially
when
it
comes
to
allowing
african
americans
to
participate
in
the
political
system
state
sen
michael
watson
r
who
is
now
running
for
mississippi's
secretary
of
state
was
part
of
a
legal
team
that
tried
to
overturn
an
election
because
a
large
number
of
african
americans
voted
for
former
u.s.
sen
thad
cochran
during
the
state's
republican
primary
runoff
election
cochran
narrowly
defeated
tea
party
darling
and
state
sen
chris
mcdaniel
during
that
election
court
documents
filed
by
watson's
law
firm
claimed
cochran
won
because
of
voting
irregularities
and
called
the

racist
attitudes
