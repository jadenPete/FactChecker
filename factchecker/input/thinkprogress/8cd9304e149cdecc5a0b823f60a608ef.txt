the
el
paso
and
dayton
shootings
weren't
an
aberration
they
were
a
statistical
certainty
the
united
states
has
been
averaging
more
than
one
mass
shooting
per
day
for
almost
four
years
now
on
saturday
millions
of
americans
went
to
bed
mourning
the
latest
deadly
mass
shooting
this
one
in
el
paso
texas
and
woke
up
the
next
day
to
news
of
a
second
in
dayton
ohio
the
weekend
carnage
left
at
least
people
dead
and
plenty
of
indignation
about
republican
lawmakers
who
refuse
to
take
up
any
meaningful
gun
reform
continuing
to
take
money
from
pro-gun
groups
like
the
national
rifle
association
in
truth
however
there
was
nothing
particularly
remarkable
about
the
close
timing
of
these
two
attacks
the
united
states
has
been
averaging
more
than
one
mass
shooting
per
day
for
at
least
the
past
three
and
a
half
years
according
to
the
definition
established
by
the
gun
violence
archive
which
tracks
every
mass
shooting
in
the
country
a
mass
shooting
is
any
incident
in
which
at
least
four
people
were
shot
and
so
far
in
there
have
been
such
incidents
monday
august
is
just
the
th
day
of
the
year
and
yes
there's
already
been
a
mass
shooting
today
in
brooklyn
if
current
trends
hold
and
given
republicans
resistance
to
any
type
of
gun
reform
there's
no
reason
to
expect
mass
shootings
to
abate
will
set
a
new
high
for
the
number
of
mass
shootings
in
the
united
states
but
it
won't
be
the
first
year
on
record
to
average
more
than
one
mass
shooting
per
day
that
distinction
belongs
to
which
saw
such
incidents
the
two
years
following
were
only
marginally
better
with
in
and
in
at
the
current
pace
will
close
out
a
year
period
in
which
americans
experienced
more
than
one
mass
shooting
per
day
el
paso
and
dayton
happening
hours
apart
isn't
just
unremarkable
it's
a
statistical
certainty
the
united
states
leads
the
world
in
the
number
of
such
mass
shootings
and
gun
deaths
conservatives
routinely
point
to
small
european
countries
with
comparatively
tiny
populations
where
a
single
deadly
incident
can
cause
their
death
rate
by
mass
shooting
to
spike
but
in
truth
no
country
of
considerable
size
comes
close
to
the
united
states
in
terms
of
the
rates
of
mass
shootings
or
to
our
gun
homicide
rate
in
the
u.s.
the
gun
homicide
rate
is
roughly
per
million
people
in
canada
the
number
is
in
the
united
kingdom
it's
less
than
in
guns
killed
americans
either
via
suicide
homicide
or
accidental
discharge
the
same
year
in
japan
guns
killed
people
the
reason
for
the
discrepancy
is
painfully
obvious
the
rate
of
gun
ownership
in
the
united
states
outpaces
the
rest
of
the
world
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
one
recent
academic
survey
of
gun
ownership
worldwide
put
the
rate
of
civilian
firearms
holdings
in
the
united
states
at
more
than
that
is
more
than
one
gun
per
person
the
only
other
country
to
have
a
rate
above
was
yemen
at
the
united
states
accounts
for
of
the
global
population
and
of
the
world's
guns
