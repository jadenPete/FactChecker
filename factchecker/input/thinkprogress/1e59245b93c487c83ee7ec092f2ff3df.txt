finds

president
donald
trump's
immigration
policy
keeps
finding
new
ways
to
grow
a
little
bit
crueler
immigration
officials
confirmed
this
week
that
deportation
deferrals
will
no
longer
be
considered
for
individuals
with
serious
medical
needs
previously
a
small
program
called
medical
deferred
action
allowed
people
often
children
to
stay
in
the
united
states
an
extra
two
years
if
they
were
receiving
treatment
for
severe
medical
needs
in
many
cases
these
families
came
to
the
country
through
legal
means
but
simply
did
not
complete
the
medical
treatment
in
the
original
time
allotted
and
are
seeking
more
time
to
continue
their
care
as
first
reported
by
wbur
boston
several
applicants
for
this
kind
of
deferral
were
surprised
to
receive
letters
from
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
uscis
informing
them
that
the
agency
was
no
longer
considering
such
requests
moreover
they
were
told
they
only
had
days
to
leave
the
country
after
which
they
could
be
forcibly
removed
which
would
make
it
much
harder
to
return
in
the
near
future
to
continue
treatment
perhaps
the
most
stunning
part
about
these
sudden
refusals
is
that
the
administration
never
even
announced
a
policy
change
only
after
wbur
first
published
its
story
about
the
letters
did
uscis
confirm
that
the
requests
would
now
be
submitted
to
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
for
consideration
an
ice
spokesperson
then
claimed
as
with
any
request
for
deferred
action
ice
reviews
each
case
on
its
own
merits
and
exercises
appropriate
discretion
after
reviewing
all
the
facts
involved
the
blanket
denials
suggest
medical
deferrals
have
no
longer
have
such
merit
the
medical
deferral
program
had
been
in
place
for
decades
ensuring
that
individuals
could
receive
medical
care
that
isn't
available
in
their
home
countries
the
irish
international
immigrant
center
which
reported
at
least
five
of
their
clients
were
denied
deferrals
explained
that
it
serves
many
families
whose
children
have
cancer
cystic
fibrosis
hiv
cerebral
palsy
muscular
dystrophy
and
epilepsy
for
example
year-old
jonathan
sanchez
is
fighting
to
stay
after
coming
on
a
tourist
visa
because
there
is
no
treatment
for
cystic
fibrosis
back
in
honduras
if
they
deny
the
program
then
i
need
to
go
back
to
my
country
and
i'll
probably
die
he
said
at
a
press
conference
monday
the
denial
letters
claim
that
uscis
will
only
consider
deferred
action
requests
for
certain
military
members
enlistees
and
their
families
this
is
hardly
reassuring
given
the
administration
also
indicated
earlier
this
summer
its
desire
to
begin
deporting
the
families
of
active
duty
service
members
