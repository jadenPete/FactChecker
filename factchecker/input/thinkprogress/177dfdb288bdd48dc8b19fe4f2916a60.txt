decided
to

sheriff
he
said
in
a
statement
watch
out
world
we
are
back
arpaio
was
pardoned
by
president
donald
trump
in
august
he
is
now
running
for
the
same
office
he
used
to
illegally
target
and
jail
latinx
people
in
an
abusive
tent
city
that
he
himself
once
described
as
a
concentration
camp
over
the
course
of
years
detainees
in
the
camp
were
left
to
swelter
in
dangerous
temperatures
exceeding
degrees
fahrenheit
during
the
summer
during
the
winter
inmates
were
exposed
to
the
elements
and
not
allowed
to
wear
insulated
clothing
people
detained
in
the
tent
city
told
reporters
of
broken
fans
and
a
lack
of
cold
water
they
said
it
became
so
hot
their
shoes
melted
the
camps
were
surrounded
by
electric
fences
i
was
in
the
tents
when
we
hit
degrees
one
former
inmate
francisco
chairez
wrote
for
the
washington
post
in
august
it
was
impossible
to
stay
cool
in
the
oppressive
heat
everyone
would
strip
down
to
their
underwear
there
was
no
cold
water
only
water
from
vending
machines
and
eventually
the
machines
would
run
out
people
would
faint
some
had
heatstroke
that
summer
ambulances
came
about
three
times
one
man
died
in
his
bed
arpaio
made
it
a
practice
to
humiliate
the
detainees
at
the
facility
in
he
paraded
hundreds
of
latinx
immigrant
detainees
picked
up
on
non-violent
offenses
through
the
city
streets
from
the
county
jail
to
the
tent
city
in
the
justice
department
launched
an
investigation
into
claims
that
arpaio
had
illegally
used
racial
profiling
to
detain
latinx
people
a
report
by
the
department's
civil
rights
division
found
arpaio's
deputies
frequently
used
racist
language
when
discussing
latinx
inmates
the
page
document
also
outlined
how
arpaio's
office
had
engaged
in
unconstitutional
policing
and
established
a
pervasive
culture
of
discriminatory
bias
against
latinos
extending
to
the
highest
levels
of
the
agency
arpaio
denied
the
racial
profiling
charges
though
the
maricopa
county
board
of
supervisors
later
voted
to
settle
portions
of
the
doj's
subsequent
lawsuit
against
the
sheriff's
office
over
the
matter
in
december
a
federal
judge
wrote
to
arpaio
who
was
refusing
to
comply
with
a
previous
court
order
to
stop
racially
profiling
warning
him
that
he
faced
possible
contempt
of
court
charges
in
march
arpaio
admitted
to
violating
that
court
order
and
in
october
following
an
investigation
federal
prosecutors
announced
plans
to
charge
him
with
criminal
contempt
of
court
arpaio
was
found
guilty
of
contempt
in
july
two
months
later
while
facing
a
sentence
of
up
to
six
months
in
jail
he
received
a
presidential
pardon
from
trump
arpaio's
history
of
alleged
abuse
were
chronicled
through
exhaustive
investigative
reporting
by
a
number
of
outlets
including
the
phoenix
new
times
which
won
a
million
settlement
after
the
sheriff
arrested
one
of
its
reporters
for
covering
him
he
was
apparently
a
profoundly
ineffective
sheriff
a
investigative
report
alleged
that
arpaio's
office
had
failed
to
investigate
over
alleged
sexual
assault
cases
reported
to
his
office
including
dozens
of
child
molestations
between
and
alone
between
and
the
new
times
reported
at
least
people
hanged
themselves
in
arpaio's
jails
of
the
nearly
people
who
died
in
jail
under
his
watch
committed
suicide
while
dozens
of
others
died
without
explanation
in
the
same
day
president
barack
obama
announced
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
arpaio
arrested
a
year-old
child
during
an
immigration
sweep
arpaio
is
also
a
supporter
of
trump's
racist
birtherism
conspiracy
theory
which
claims
that
obama
was
not
born
in
the
united
states
but
forged
his
birth
certificate
in
order
to
become
president
arpaio's
targeted
cruel
treatment
of
immigrants
and
latinx
americans
has
notable
parallels
to
the
way
the
trump
administration
has
treated
immigrants
in
federal
detention
centers
among
other
things
the
administration
has
forcibly
separated
families
placing
adults
children
and
infants
in
inhumane
and
overcrowded
facilities
without
basic
resources
like
beds
toothpase
or
soap
