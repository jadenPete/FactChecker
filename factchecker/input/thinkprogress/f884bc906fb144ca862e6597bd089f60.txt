journal
nbc

has
bad
news
for
president
trump
on
the

to
start
his
net
approval
rating
on
the
economy
is
down
to
a
mere
three
percentage
points
of
registered
voters
approve
while
disapprove
this
is
a
big
drop
from
the
point
edge
he
had
in
early
may
and
an
even
bigger
dropped
from
the
point
edge
he
had
last
july
this
drop
of
support
on
the
economy
has
brought
his
overall
approval
rating
to
its
lowest
level
of
the
year
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
at
the
same
time
said
they
disapproved
of
trump
some
of
voters
support
trump's
handling
of
the
economy
but
don't
approve
of
him
overall
but
in
a
warning
sign
for
mr
trump
the
journal
notes
that
those
voters
prefer
a
democratic
candidate
over
mr
trump
by
to
why
have
trump's
ratings
on
the
economy
dropped
as
cnbc
explains
in
the
lead
to
its
story
on
the
poll
add
president
trump
to
the
list
of
those
hurt
by
his
trade
war
in
fact
trump's
disastrous
tariff-driven
trade
war
with
china
hasn't
just
hurt
americans
in
the
pocketbook
and
caused
volatility
in
the
stock
market
it
has
actually
made
americans
more
supportive
of
free
trade
near
the
start
of
his
presidency
americans
net
approval
of
free
trade
was
percentage
points
supported
it
and
opposed
today
that
net
approval
is
a
whopping
points
as
support
but
only
oppose
that
change
was
driven
most
sharply
by
political
independents
reports
cnbc
who
now
embrace
free
trade
by
a
margin
the
bottom
line
is
that
whatever
advantage
trump
thought
he
was
going
to
get
in
the
election
from
his
handling
of
the
economy
and
his
trade
war
with
china
has
all
but
vanished
