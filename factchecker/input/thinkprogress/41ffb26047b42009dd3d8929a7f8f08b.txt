the
el
paso
mass
shooting
is
a
far-right
terror
attack
it's
another
incident
which
is
as
infuriating
as
it
is
predictable
it's
the
same
story
over
and
over
again
an
individual
is
radicalized
online
into
believing
that
the
white
race
is
under
attack
from
a
perceived
other
that
individual
then
uses
easily-accesible
high-powered
weaponry
to
carry
out
an
attack
against
an
undefended
target
of
the
other
in
order
to
attract
more
attention
he
posts
an
outline
of
his
plan
on
an
extremist
website
where
he
is
rapidly
venerated
and
turned
into
a
martyr
over
the
last
year
alone
this
story
has
played
out
in
pittsburgh
san
diego
christchurch
new
zealand
and
now
el
paso
on
saturday
a
year-old
gunman
armed
with
an
ak-
type
rifle
entered
a
crowded
mall
in
this
majority-hispanic
city
and
opened
fire
killing
at
least
and
injuring
dozens
more
he
was
taken
into
custody
by
responding
officers
without
incident
prior
to
the
shooting
the
gunman
who
was
identified
as
patrick
crusius
from
dallas
is
believed
to
have
posted
a
four-page
manifesto
on
the
website
chan
the
same
website
the
christchurch
and
san
diego
shooters
used
to
post
theirs
in
it
he
goes
through
a
laundry
list
of
white
nationalist
talking
points
decrying
the
hispanic
invasion
of
texas
praising
the
christchurch
shooter
and
saying
that
america
will
soon
become
a
one-party
state
thanks
to
increased
immigration
the
manifesto
has
not
yet
been
officially
confirmed
by
law
enforcement
however
the
timing
of
the
post
coupled
with
the
corroborating
details
inside
it
match
up
with
the
shooter
el
paso
police
chief
gregg
allen
said
that
the
suspect's
attack
has
a
nexus
to
a
potential
hate
crime
el
paso
county
sheriff
richard
wiles
put
things
even
more
bluntly
this
anglo
man
came
here
to
kill
hispanics
i'm
outraged
and
you
should
be
too
the
entire
nation
should
be
outraged
wiles
said
in
a
statement
in
this
day
and
age
with
all
the
serious
issues
we
face
we
are
still
confronted
with
people
who
kill
another
for
the
sole
reason
of
the
color
of
their
skin
wiles
added
that
he
was
sick
of
people
jumping
in
front
of
the
cameras
offering
prayers
and
condolences
as
things
just
keep
getting
worse
president
donald
trump
who
held
a
rally
in
el
paso
in
february
where
he
lied
about
how
immigration
had
made
el
paso
a
dangerous
city
offered
his
condolences
after
the
shooting
terrible
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
reports
are
very
bad
many
killed
he
tweeted
spoke
to
governor
to
pledge
total
support
of
federal
government
god
be
with
you
all
trump
then
followed
up
said
tweet
with
a
picture
of
him
and
a
mixed
martial
arts
star
before
then
tweeting
pretty
much
the
exact
same
thing
when
news
of
a
mass
shooting
in
dayton
ohio
broke
democratic
presidential
candidates
were
quick
to
condemn
the
shooting
america
is
under
attack
from
homegrown
white
nationalist
terrorism
that
ideology
is
evil
mayor
pete
buttigieg
tweeted
it
is
being
condoned
at
the
highest
levels
of
our
government
enough
is
enough
we
have
an
obligation
to
act
former
congressman
beto
o'rourke
d-tx
who
represented
a
district
that
includes
el
paso
flew
back
to
the
city
and
specifically
called
out
trump
for
helping
to
create
an
environment
in
which
these
sort
of
incidents
occur
it
does
not
just
offend
our
sensibilities
it
fundamentally
changes
the
character
of
this
country
o'rourke
said
and
it
leads
to
violence
in
recent
months
the
fbi
has
specifically
warned
of
this
sort
of
terror
threat
we
are
most
concerned
about
lone
offenders
primarily
using
firearms
as
they
represent
the
dominant
trend
for
lethal
domestic
terrorists
michael
mcgarrity
the
fbi's
assistant
director
of
counterterrorism
told
the
house
committee
on
homeland
security
in
may
frequently
these
individuals
act
without
a
clear
group
affiliation
or
guidance
making
them
challenging
to
identify
investigate
and
disrupt
in
july
fbi
director
christopher
wray
told
the
senate
that
the
majority
of
the
bureau's
domestic
terror
arrests
since
october
have
involved
white
supremacy
but
gun
control
dreams
aside
quite
how
you
handle
this
de-centralized
radicalization
is
a
question
which
is
both
extremely
pressing
and
extremely
difficult
as
thinkprogress
has
previously
noted
each
new
manifesto
creates
more
sources
of
inspiration
and
knowledge
for
other-would-be
attackers
which
are
in
turn
amplified
by
extremist
websites
like
chan
but
the
first
amendment
means
that
these
manifestos
while
vile
are
not
illegal
unless
they
are
likely
to
inspire
imminent
lawless
action
in
others
what's
more
chan
is
based
in
the
philippines
which
has
less
restrictive
moderation
policies
meaning
that
it
won't
necessarily
bow
to
the
same
sort
of
pressure
that
forced
websites
to
remove
far-right
posters
and
content
in
wake
of
the
unite
the
right
rally
in
meanwhile
rather
than
tamping
down
on
violence
it
appears
that
trump's
mere
presence
incites
it
as
the
washington
post
noted
in
march
counties
which
hosted
trump
rallies
including
el
paso
saw
their
hate
crimes
level
skyrocket
by
more
than
percent
some
of
this
rhetoric
appears
that
it
might
have
rubbed
off
on
the
el
paso
shooter
according
to
the
southern
poverty
law
center
the
shooter
had
a
twitter
page
where
he
regularly
espoused
pro-trump
rhetoric
including
liking
an
image
where
nine
firearms
are
used
to
spell
out
trump's
name
