of

the
trump
administration's
plan
to
freeze
fuel
efficiency
standards
in
defiance
of
california's
stricter
more
environmentally
friendly
rules
is
set
to
have
dire
ramifications
for
emissions

and
the

according
to
new
research
out
wednesday
rolling
back
california's
robust
vehicle
emissions
requirements
could
cost
the
u.s.
economy
billion
through
an
analysis
from
the
environmental
policy
group
energy
innovation
found
president
donald
trump's
efforts
to
undo
obama-era
rules
will
also
increase
u.s.
gasoline
consumption
by
up
to
billion
barrels
subsequently
increasing
u.s.
transport
emissions
up
to

under

the
environmental

epa
and
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
nhtsa
have
been
engaged
in
a
bitter
feud
with
california
over
emissions
standards
california
has
set
its
own
standards
for
decades
under
the
clean
air
act's
section
through
an
epa
waiver
with
significant
success
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
adopted
the
same
standards
data
shows
that
those
section
states
which
represent
more
than
of
the
u.s.
auto
market
have
reduced
pollution
and
improved
air
quality
improving
both
public
health
and
the
environment
but
the
trump
administration
has
targeted
california's
waiver
arguing
in
favor
of
freezing
fuel
efficiency
standards
on
new
vehicles
through
nationally
while
stripping
the
state
of
its
exemption
the
government
is
also
embroiled
in
litigation
with
the
section
states
which
are
fighting
to
keep
their
standards
as
california
and
the
white
house
escalate
their
feud
energy
innovation's
new
modeling
gives
a
preview
of
what
the
trump
administration's
plans
would
mean
long-term
freezing
federal
fuel
economy
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
standards
will
harm
u.s.
consumers
who
will
pay
more
money
to
drive
their
cars
the
same
distance
the
energy
innovation
report
warns
pointing
to
both
economic
implications
and
likely
associated
climate
impacts
and
poorer
air
quality
the
only
winners
are
the
oil
companies
who
stand
to
sell
more
gasoline
at
the
expense
of
american
consumers
manufacturers
and
the
environment
the
group
underscores
initially
the
firm
found
that
there
would
be
economy-wide
financial
gains
as
low-efficiency
cars
are
cheaper
to
make
but
over
the
years
increasing
fuel
expenses
are
projected
to
cut
into
those
gains
ultimately
costing
the
national
economy
hundreds
of
billions
using
the
open-sourced
and
peer-reviewed
energy
policy
simulator
eps
the
group
looked
at
the
economic
impact
of
freezing
the
standards
nationally
and
revoking
california's
waiver
in
addition
to
a
scenario
in
which
california
retains
its
waiver
following
litigation
but
the
rest
of
the
country
is
held
to
the
frozen
standard
in
the
first
scenario
the
economic
cost
by
is
projected
to
be
billion
the
second
scenario
is
more
uncertain
however
the
report
estimates
it
would
affect
around
of
vehicle
sales
and
could
create
a
split
market
one
where
automakers
sell
more
efficient
vehicles
in
section
states
and
less
efficient
vehicles
elsewhere
energy
innovation
estimates
that
scenario
would
cost
between
billion
and
billion
by
mid-century
costs
on
the
lower
end
reflect
a
situation
in
which
carmakers
in
non-section
states
would
still
largely
comply
with
california's
standards
while
those
on
the
higher
end
reflect
a
split
market
possibility
in
addition
to
the
economic
costs
the
report
also
underscores
the
climate
implications
while
the
growing
market
for
electric
vehicles
would
mitigate
climate
impacts
beginning
in
the
s
energy
innovation
finds
that
vehicle
emissions
would
spike
to
their
highest
point
in
the
s
based
on
current
trends
under
current
policy
transportation
sector
emissions
are
projected
to
be
million
metric
tons
mmt
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
co
e
by
the
report
notes
but
with
a
nationwide
freeze
emissions
would
increase
to
mmt
in
a
increase
if
section
states
retain
their
autonomy
that
increase
would
fall
between
and
mmt
the
report's
authors
clarify
that
all
estimates
should
be
viewed
as
somewhat
conservative
however
given
that
they
assume
a
trend
towards
purchasing
electric
vehicles
meaning
the
actual
emissions
impact
could
be
much
larger
energy
innovation
policy
analyst
and
report
author
megan
mahajan
told
thinkprogress
that
the
overall
result
of
a
freeze
would
be
rising
emissions
and
increasing
costs
although
the
current
administration
argues
the
standards
freeze
is
in
americans
best
interest
we
find
that
it
hurts
consumers
and
the
climate
mahajan
said
our
results
show
that
the
economic
impacts
to
consumers
will
only
grow
over
time
as
they
continue
to
lose
out
on
the
significant
fuel
savings
that
come
with
stronger
standards
the
report
also
focuses
on
the
international
implications
of
the
proposed
freeze
due
to
the
canada-california
fuel
economy
memorandum
of
understanding
impacts
associated
with
the
move
will
be
felt
across
the
border
canada's
auto
market
is
closely
tied
with
the
united
states
and
the
country
has
indicated
it
will
likely
side
with
california
in
a
split
market
scenario
but
if
that
doesn't
happen
and
canada
follows
the
u.s.
federal
freeze
energy
innovation
predicts
the
move
could
cost
canadian
consumers
up
to
billion
through
it
could
also
increase
canadian
transport
emissions
up
to
by
in
addition
to
hurting
u.s.
consumers
a
fuel
economy
and
emissions
standards
freeze
would
have
global
implications
the
report
argues
energy
innovation's
findings
are
only
the
latest
to
counter
the
trump
administration's
push
for
the
freeze
even
the
auto
industry
has
expressed
deep
reservations
many
carmakers
had
already
incorporated
the
emissions
standards
into
their
products
along
with
obama-era
efficiency
efforts
the
sudden
change
could
cost
companies
and
some
have
made
efforts
to
insulate
themselves
from
any
shifts
in
policy
at
the
end
of
july
california
inked
a
deal
with
ford
bmw
honda
and
volkswagen
with
all
four
major
carmakers
pledging
fuel-efficient
cars
at
the
time
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
linked
the
deal
to
broader
efforts
to
combat
global
warming
clean
air
emissions
standards
are
perhaps
the
most
significant
thing
this
state
can
do
and
this
nation
can
do
to
advance
those
goals
the
governor
said
the
trump
administration
is
hellbent
on
rolling
them
back
they
are
in
complete
denialism
about
climate
change
but
the
standoff
between
california
and
the
white
house
is
only
set
to
escalate
last
friday
the
epa
and
nhtsa
sent
the
final
proposed
rule
to
the
white
house
for
review
that
same
day
california
and
new
york
led
a
group
of
states
in
suing
nhtsa
which
has
reduced
the
penalties
facing
automakers
who
fail
to
meet
obama-era
corporate
average
fuel
economy
cafe
standards
under
trump
the
penalty
has
been
reduced
from
to
per
tenth
of
a
mile
per
gallon
and
on
tuesday
senate
democrats
encouraged
major
automakers
to
join
the
four
companies
that
have
already
made
a
deal
on
emissions
with
california
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
between
the
federal
government
and
states
the
california
agreement
is
a
commonsense
framework
that
provides
flexibility
to
the
industry
to
meet
tailpipe
standards
while
also
taking
important
steps
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
save
money
on
fuel
for
consumers
the
senators
wrote
in
a
letter
to
the
companies
which
include
nissan
toyota
and
volvo
the
letter
was
signed
by
several
presidential
candidates
