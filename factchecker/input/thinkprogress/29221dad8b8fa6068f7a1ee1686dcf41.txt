trump
promotes
new
video
complete
with
white
supremacist
symbol
it's
the
latest
in
the
long
line
of
far-right
interactions
that
trump
has
had
president
donald
trump
promoted
a
new
video
wednesday
that
featured
some
of
his
favorite
hits
job
creation
stock
market
growth
low
unemployment
rates
regulatory
rollbacks
high
approval
rating
among
republicans
all
pretty
obvious
content
trump
himself
posted
the
video
on
twitter
with
the
comment
thank
you
for
your
support
as
we
make
america
great
again
but
toward
the
end
of
the
video
the
video
uses
a
symbol
of
a
lion's
head
which
as
writer
dustin
giebel
and
former
snopes
managing
editor
brooke
binkowski
first
noted
on
twitter
was
also
used
by
the
far-right
publication
vdare
vdare
which
describes
itself
as
america's
immigration
voice
was
founded
by
white
nationalist
peter
brimelow
and
has
regularly
published
the
work
of
prominent
far-right
extremists
including
jared
taylor
a
well-known
figure
in
white
nationalism
for
decades
jason
kessler
who
organized
the
deadly
unite
the
right
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
was
also
a
contributor
to
further
illustrate
the
flavor
of
the
site
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
vdare
published
three
stories
one
by
anne
coulter
on
the
danger
of
drunk
driving
illegal
aliens
one
by
hardline
anti-immigrant
activist
michelle
malkin
and
one
proclaiming
that
the
u.s.
was
teetering
on
the
edge
of
becoming
a
third-world
country
partly
because
of
the
recent
attempted-assault
conviction
of
two
proud
boys
as
mediaite
noted
the
lion
logo
has
been
used
by
other
far-right
groups
before
vdare
in
a
group
called
the
lion
guard
which
described
itself
as
an
informal
civilian
group
dedicated
to
the
safety
and
security
of
trump
supports
by
exposing
far-left
infiltrators
and
saboteurs
the
group's
website
which
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
updated
since
also
features
the
lion
as
well
as
the
quote
from
italian
dictator
benito
mussolini
that
it
is
better
to
be
a
lion
for
a
day
than
a
lamb
for
eternity
trump
of
course
has
a
long
and
sordid
history
of
amplifying
far-right
talking
points
conspiracies
and
prominent
personalities
aside
from
his
outright
racism
like
saying
members
of
the
squad
of
four
congresswomen
should
to
go
back
to
the
corrupt
countries
they
came
from
though
three
are
american
born
and
all
are
u.s.
citizens
trump
has
also
tweeted
about
the
south
african
white
genocide
which
is
a
favorite
conspiracy
trope
of
white
nationalists
trump
has
also
retweeted
katie
hopkins
a
british
far-right
columnist
who
once
called
migrants
cockroaches
and
who
tweeted
in
the
wake
of
terror
attacks
in
the
u.k.
in
that
a
final
solution
was
needed
in
trump
also
retweeted
a
video
by
the
fringe
ultranationalist
group
britain
first
a-now
defunct
party
whose
deputy
leader
has
been
convicted
of
hate
speech
in
northern
ireland
in
fact
according
to
an
august
analysis
from
the
daily
beast
of
the
unverified
users
that
trump
has
retweeted
nearly
have
been
suspended
this
post
has
been
updated
to
clarify
that
the
trump
campaign
did
not
produce
the
video
in
question
it
was
produced
by
the
twitter
account
som
thingwicked
and
was
tweeted
out
by
the
president
from
his
personal
twitter
account
