it

omar
gonzalez-pagan
senior
attorney
at
lambda
legal
a
civil
rights
organization
focused
on
lgbtq
people
told
thinkprogress
these
cases
will
affect
the
ability
of
lgbtq
people
to
be
full
members
of
society
and
to
contribute
to
society
by
entering
the
workplace
and
be
free
of
discrimination
in
the
worst
case
scenario
lgbtq
people
would
have
to
rely
on
a
patchwork
of
state
protections
for
employment
protections
and
the
equality
act
a
sweeping
lgbtq
nondiscrimination
bill
passed
by
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
in
may
would
become
even
more
critical
to
protecting
lgbtq
rights
twenty-one
states
the
district
of
columbia
and
two
territories
explicitly
prohibit
employment
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
christy
mallory
senior
counsel
for
the
ucla
school
of
law's
williams
institute
said
the
court
may
decide
that
neither
sexual
orientation
or
gender
identity
discrimination
are
forms
of
sex
discrimination
prohibited
by
title
vii
this
would
remove
existing
non-discrimination
protections
for
lgbt
people
under
title
vii
which
would
have
a
particularly
significant
impact
on
lgbt
people
who
live
in
states
without
statewide
non-discrimination
laws
there
are
three
cases
but
two
questions
before
the
court
zarda
v
altitude
express
and
bostock
v
clayton
county
have
been
consolidated
to
consider
sexual
orientation
as
sex
discrimination
and
harris
funeral
homes
v
eeoc
will
consider
discrimination
against
transgender
people
the
zarda
case
involved
an
employee
named
donald
zarda
being
fired
from
altitude
express
where
he
worked
as
a
skydiver
he
informed
a
woman
he
was
gay
while
they
were
strapped
to
each
other
because
he
thought
it
would
make
her
feel
more
comfortable
she
later
informed
his
employer
that
she
wasn't
happy
with
his
sharing
his
being
gay
and
he
was
subsequently
fired
zarda
died
in
but
his
estate
pursued
the
case
the
bostock
case
focuses
on
gerald
bostock
a
child
welfare
services
coordinator
who
was
in
a
gay
recreational
softball
league
he
said
his
participation
in
the
league
and
his
sexual
orientation
became
a
problem
with
someone
at
work
then
he
was
fired
for
conduct
unbecoming
of
a
county
employee
which
he
said
was
tied
to
his
sexuality
harris
involves
aimee
stephens
a
trans
woman
who
was
fired
from
her
job
at
a
funeral
parlor
after
she
informed
the
funeral
director
she
worked
for
that
she
was
transgender
she
had
worked
in
funeral
services
for
nearly
years
and
received
positive
feedback
from
her
employer
the
briefs
from
plaintiffs
and
their
supporters
have
focused
on
a
textualist
understanding
of
the
law
hewing
closely
to
the
original
text
of
the
constitution
which
the
conservative
justices
may
be
more
inclined
to
accept
rather
than
legislative
intent
or
what
lawmakers
had
in
mind
in
passing
related
legislation
several
law
professors
have
argued
in
their
briefs
that
the
court
can
look
to
price
waterhouse
v
hopkins
which
says
employers
can't
use
sex-based
stereotypes
when
taking
employment
actions
gonzalez-pagan
said
one
doesn't
need
to
believe
that
anyone
can
be
transgender
despite
the
mountains
of
evidence
the
reality
is
that
in
the
discrimination
in
this
case
against
this
employee
aimee
stephens
she
did
not
conform
to
the
expectations
of
her
birth-assigned
sex
that
the
employer
had
the
alliance
defending
freedom
a
legal
group
whose
attorneys
have
linked
marriage
equality
with
a
degradation
of
our
human
dignity
and
filed
a
petition
asking
the
court
to
hear
one
of
these
cases
has
argued
that
lower
courts
redefined
sex
in
the
law
mallory
pointed
out
that
title
vii
itself
does
not
define
the
term
sex
but
plaintiffs
and
others
can
also
argue
that
when
discriminating
against
queer
and
trans
people
you
necessarily
have
to
consider
sex
the
fact
is
that
in
the
arguments
we
are
making
that
plaintiffs
are
making
and
others
are
making
in
this
case
this
is
really
about
the
text
of
the
statute
this
is
really
a
very
conservative
argument
textualist
and
adhering
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
the
reality
is
that
when
you
consider
somebody's
same-sex
attraction
somebody's
transgender
status
by
definition
you
have
to
consider
their
sex
gonzalez-pagan
said
you
are
impermissibly
considering
sex
in
taking
an
employment
action
there's
no
way
around
that
it's
not
that
we
are
in
this
case
proposing
that
there
be
another
definition
of
sex
it
is
being
elucidated
in
other
cases
and
in
scientific
literature
and
the
medical
establishment
and
there
is
a
consensus
that
is
built
but
we
don't
even
have
to
go
there
because
either
way
because
no
matter
the
definition
you
consider
of
sex
you're
still
considering
that
sex
in
making
that
employment
decision
some
historians
have
argued
in
an
amicus
brief
that
the
understanding
of
sex
in
the
s
s
and
s
was
such
that
lgbtq
people
could
have
been
understood
to
be
included
they
wrote
this
broad
understanding
of
sex
as
evoking
a
range
of
sex
roles
sexual
expression
and
sexual
instincts
shaped
public
knowledge
about
lgbt
individuals
mid-twentieth
century
writers
sometimes
grouped
lgbt
people
under
the
term
sex
variants
a
term
introduced
by
psychiatrist
george
henry
to
mean
primarily
persons
he
considered
homosexuals
though
he
sometimes
also
included
individuals
who
wished
to
change
their
sex
regardless
of
their
sexual
desires
they
added
the
word
sex
thus
covered
a
broad
range
of
meaning
in
the
mid-twentieth
century
one
that
encompassed
the
behavior
practices
and
identities
of
lgbt
individuals
gonzalez-pagan
said
that
a
common
argument
against
the
equal
rights
amendment
in
the
s
was
that
by
prohibiting
sex
discrimination
one
could
apply
it
to
lgbtq
people
o
pponents
of
lgbtq
equality
that
are
trying
to
dismantle
these
protections
recognized
by
eeoc
and
federal
courts
and
vast
majority
of
public
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too
he
said
they
are
saying
these
protections
aren't
necessary
because
they
will
essentially
protect
lgbtq
people
and
now
they're
saying
they
don't
cover
lgbtq
people
so
it's
really
illustrative
of
their
bad
faith
he
added
it's
not
about
not
whether
we
have
arguments
on
our
side
but
whether
the
court
will
adhere
preferences
for
statutory
interpretation
or
political
ideology
that's
what
really
what's
at
stake
here
