bryan
cox
an

described
the
pepper

incident
as
brief
and
calculated
the
incident
occurred
just
one
day
after
immigrants
were
pepper-sprayed
at
an
ice
facility
in
bossier
parish
louisiana
to
deescalate
a
small
disturbance
around
lunchtime
according
to
lawyers
for
several
migrants
at
the
facilities
however
the
conditions
in
the
detention
centers
are
far
worse
than
has
been
reported
the
total
number
of
immigrants
pepper-sprayed
at
the
pine
prairie
facility
was
in

over
a
legal

with
the
southern

told
the

a
prior
nbc
news

revealed
officers
had
allegedly
detained
at
least
one
transgender
migrant
in
isolation
for
four
months
because
of
the
way
she
looked
others
have
suffered
equally
dire
fates
the
splc
reported
in

that
in
addition
to
arbitrary
solitary
confinement
migrants
at
pine
prairie
were
allegedly
being
held
in
deplorable
conditions
among
other
things
detainees
were
forced
to
consume
barely
edible
food
and
were
kept
in
foul
smelling
moldy
rooms
some
have
been
held
in
the
barbed-wire-encircled
processing
facility
for
months
at
the
bossier
parish
facility
things
are
no
better
migrants

there
are
lots
of
cops
who

from
another

they
beat
up
the

they
pepper

them
and
handcuff
them

there's
even
an

here
help
us
please
this
is
ugly
he
added
both

seem
to
have
stemmed
from

reported
currently
there
