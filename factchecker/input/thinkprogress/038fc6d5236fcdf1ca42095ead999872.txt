other
companies

campaign
manager
lane
hudson
told
the
blade
microsoft
was
the
first
company
that
engaged
with
zero
for
zeros
in
good
faith
we
discussed
their
concerns
they
heard
ours
and
their
employees
weighed
in
we
are
thrilled
that
they
have
responded
to
our
campaign
last
month
he
told
thinkprogress
that
the
zero
for
zeros
effort
was
not
meant
to
not
be
an
attack
on
these
companies
because
we
view
them
as
our
allies
they
have
invested
in
their
employees
and
customers
and
been
with
us
in
these
court
battles
rather
they
are
requests
for
a
conversation
about
pac
giving
so
we
can
talk
about
why
it's
important
not
only
to
the
lgbtq
community
but
to
their
employees
and
their
customers
and
to
the
overall
movement
in
general
and
how
it
can
be
beneficial
to
their
business
