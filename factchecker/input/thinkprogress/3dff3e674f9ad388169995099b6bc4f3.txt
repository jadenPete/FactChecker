one
of
new

major
cities

offering

to
its

raised
glaring
concerns
over

in

the
growing
crisis
in

comes
after
years
of
resident
concerns
over
lead
in
drinking
water
leading
many
people
last

to
start
using
water
filters
on
their
taps
that
change
hasn't
gone

enough
the

says

now
the

is
facing

said
sunday
that
beginning
monday
bottled
water
would
be
available
to
city
residents
concerned
about
water
quality
access
to
safe
drinking
water
is
critically
important
to
our
administrations
and
we
take
health
risks
associated
with
lead
in

water
very
seriously
the
officials
said
in
a
joint
statement
the
move
comes
amid
growing
controversy
over
lead
in
newark's
drinking
water
a
problem
that
stretches
back
several
years
some
of
the
city's
lead
service
pipes
are
around
a
century
old
sparking
concern
among
public
health
experts
and
since
at
least
inadequate
corrosion
treatment
at
the
pequannock
water
plant
has
led
to
high
lead
levels
in
some
residents
tap
water
breaching
parts
per
billion
the
standard
set
by
the
epa
after
downplaying
the
city's
water
issues
for
over
a
year
newark
in
october
gave
away
water
filters
to
address
the
problem
but
residents
say
they
still
have
lead
in
their
drinking
water
on
friday
the
epa
sent
a
letter
to
the
city
and
state
advising
bottled
water
usage
for
residents
in
homes
with
lead
pipes
w
e
are
unable
at
this
time
to
assure
newark
residents
that
their
heath
is
fully
protected
when
drinking

water
filtered
through
these
devices
the
epa
wrote
after
testing
water
at
two
residences
in
newark
under
president
donald
trump
the
epa
has
repeatedly
said
that
water
issues
are
the
country's
top
environmental
problem
above
climate
change
but
newark's
crisis
reflects
ongoing
contamination
trends
across
the
country
and
it's
not
just
lead
that's
leaching
into
the
water
toxic
forever
chemicals
found
in
non-stick
pans
and
many
other
everyday
items
have
appeared
in
water
around
the
country
including
in
michigan
and
in
states
like
iowa
agricultural

polluting

in
both
instances
health
and
environmental
advocates
have
argued
the
epa
is
not
doing
enough
to
address
the
problem
but
the
agency
indicated
it
might
assert
its
authority
if
newark's
situation
does
not
improve
the
epa
said
it
is
prepared
to
take
appropriate
action
to
protect
public
health
in
the
city
contact
with
lead
can
result
in
growth
development
problems
neurological
issues
and
occasionally
fatalities
lead
in
public
drinking
water
can
be
especially
problematic
given
the
universal
nature
of
water
consumption
in
flint
a
drinking
water
crisis
that
began
in
affected
around
people
after
the
city
switched
its
water
source
multiple
deaths
are
associated
with
lead
pollution
there
and
residents
have
repeatedly
accused
public
officials
of
lying
to
them
about
the
extent
of
the
issue
litigation
over
responsibility
for
flint's
tragedy
remains
ongoing
epa
data
has
repeatedly
shown
that
communities
of
color
and
low-income
areas
disproportionately
suffer
from
environmental
problems
like
air
and
water
issues
and
while
newark
like
flint
is
heavily
black
with
a
high
poverty
rate
the
city
has
so
far
worked
to
avoid
comparing
the
two
situations
even
as
newark's
public
health
crisis
grows
mayor
baraka
has
previously
called
on
trump
to
help
newark
address
its
water
issues
in
january
baraka
told
the
white
house
the
cost
would
likely
be
around
million
prior
to
that
the
city
had
historically
argued
that
its
water
was
safe
to
drink
despite
concerns
now
the
city
is
advising
residents
to
run
their
taps
for
five
minutes
before
using
the
water
bottled
water
is
only
being
distributed
to
certain
residents
who
had
previously
received
filters
although
pregnant
people
and
young
children
are
advised
to
drink
bottled
water
baraka
has
insisted
that
the
bottled
water
is
only
a
preliminary
precaution
but
advocates
argue
the
city
still
isn't
doing
enough

new
caucus
sued
city
and
state
officials
in
arguing
that
systemic
failures
had
allowed
the
lead
contamination
to
occur
both
groups
greeted
the
city's
move
towards
bottled
water
for
impacted
residents
but
expressed
continued
concern
we
are
deeply
troubled
by
the
city's
announcement

the

nrdc's

said
in

going
on
to
express
hope
that
both

can
work
cooperatively
with
the

this
