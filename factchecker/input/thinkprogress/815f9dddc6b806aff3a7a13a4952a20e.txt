substantial

the

department
of
corrections
regulations
that

serious
medical
or

contend

cubilette-polanco

at
p
m
when

cell

was
dead
she
had
been
dead
so
long
that
first
responders
found
her
body
cold
to
the
touch
the
complaint
states
andrea
j.
ritchie
a
lawyer
and
author
of
invisible
no
more
police
violence
against
black
women
and
women
of
color
said
that
the
treatment
cubilette-polanco
was
subjected
to
is
all
too
common
trans
women
and
particularly
trans
women
of
color
spend
a
lot
of
time
whether
they're
incarcerated
in
jails
or
in
prisons
in
some
form
of
segregation
she
said
it
puts
them
at
increased
risk
of
violence
increased
risk
of
medical
complications
or
in
layleen's
case
death
it
puts
them
at
increased
risk
of
mental
health
need
because
the
conditions
themselves
are
detrimental
to
one's
mental
health
alex
vitale
a
professor
of
sociology
at
brooklyn
college
and
author
of
the
book
the
end
of
policing
told
thinkprogress
that
cubilette-polanco's
death
was
part
of
a
wider
problem
within
the
criminal
justice
system
when
you
understand
that
cities
often
use
the
criminal
justice
system
to
manage
people
experiencing
financial
precarity
and
poverty
it's
easier
to
understand
how
cubilette-polanco
wound
up
in
rikers
in
the
first
place
new
york
city
has
produced
this
huge
population
of
folks
who
are
living
in
very
precarious
circumstances
vitale
explained
whether
they're
involved
in
low-level
drug
dealing
low-level
thievery
sex
work
living
outdoors
experiencing
mental
health
crises
drug
addiction
the
city's
primary
response
to
all
these
populations
has
been
to
put
them
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
to
cycle
them
through
specialized
courts
and
rikers
island
and
constant
police
engagement
vitale
said
that
if
the
city
worked
to
decriminalize
sex
work
develop
accessibility
to
medical
care
including
epilepsy
care
and
mental
health
care
and
provided
high
quality
neighborhood-based
health
services
it's
possible
cubilette-polanco
wouldn't
have
had
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
he
added
that
sometimes
it
is
the
most
vulnerable
prisoners
who
end
up
in
segregation
we
know
that
punitive
segregation
and
various
forms
of
solitary
confinement
are
always
disproportionately
populated
with
folks
with
mental
health
problems
because
they're
not
capable
of
providing
care
in
a
humane
way
in
that
setting
vitale
said
so
those
folks
become
labeled
as
a
problem
to
be
managed
through
punitive
segregation
we
don't
know
the
details
of
what
led
to
the
fight
that
resulted
in
putting
her
there
but
this
is
a
common
pattern
that
the
most
vulnerable
prisoners
end
up
in
punitive
segregation
in
june
shortly
after
cubilette-polanco's
death
more
than
people
gathered
in
foley
square
in
new
york
city
to
mourn
her
the
event
was
hosted
by
the
new
york
city
anti-violence
project
and
co-sponsored
by
over
organizations
including
the
new
york
transgender
advocacy
group
translatina
network
global
action
project
lambda
legal
and
the
sylvia
rivera
law
project
cubilette-polanco's
mother
arecelis
polanco
her
sister
melania
brown
and
her
brother
salomon
cubilette
went
to
the
rally
and
wore
lgbtq
pride
rainbows
later
that
month
cubilette-polanco's
family
and
activists
gathered
at
city
hall
to
demand
accountability
for
her
death
presidential
hopeful
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
shared
cubilette-polanco's
story
in
july
and
called
for
reforms
to
the
criminal
justice
system
warren
tweeted
let's
be
clear
layleen
cubilette-polanco
should
still
be
alive
solitary
confinement
is
cruel
and
inhumane
we
must
end
this
practice
enforce
strict
standards
for
medical
care
and
provide
extra
layers
of
protection
for
lgbtq
people
andrea
ritchie
said
efforts
such
as
no
new
jails
which
was
formed
in
and
had
many
of
its
members
come
from
the
campaign
to
shutdown
rikers
is
by
far
the
better
solution
we
need
another
approach
and
that's
not
building
smaller
jails
in
the
boroughs
and
it's
not
building
jails
specifically
for
trans
women
it's
not
building
jail
for
people
with
unmet
mental
health
needs
because
no
one
is
getting
good
mental
health
care
in
a
cage
ritchie
said
her
life
is
so
important
and
so
valuable
on
her
own
and
to
her
family
and
the
people
who
loved
and
cared
about
her
she
added
speaking
of
cubilette-polanco's
death
but
it's
also
important
as
a
clarion
call
to
all
of
us
to
really
heed
the
demand
that
this
not
be
our
approach
to
poverty
that
this
not
be
our
approach
to
unmet
mental
health
needs
and
unmet
health
care
needs
ritchie
said
this
can't
be
our
response
to
structural
exclusion
of
trans
women
of
color
she
said
it
can't
be
our
response
to
every
form
of
need
or
harm
or
conflict
and
it's
literally
costing
people's
lives
