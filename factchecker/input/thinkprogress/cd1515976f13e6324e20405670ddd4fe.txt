guest
claims
muslim
congresswomen
have
holocaust
envy
they
are
using
islamist
tactics
to
invert
reality
on
her
fox
news
show
monday
night
laura
ingraham
hosted
a
conversation
dedicated
to
further
demonizing
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
and
ilhan
omar
d-mn
over
their
planned
visit
to
and
subsequent
ban
from
israel
guest
qanta
ahmed
a
member
of
the
council
on
foreign
relations
did
not
hold
back
in
painting
the
congresswomen
as
terrorist
sympathizers
claiming
that
they
have
holocaust
envy
they
are
using
islamist
tactics
to
invert
reality
ahmed
said
what
they
are
seeking
they
have
a
grotesque
holocaust
envy
and
just
hear
me
out
on
that
islamists
envy
what
they
see
as
the
special
mark
upon
the
jewish
people
that
is
the
membership
of
genocide
it's
a
terrible
thing
that
befell
the
jewish
people
but
islamists
envy
it
ahmed
suggested
that
tlaib
and
omar
in
fact
deny
the
holocaust
while
they
deny
the
existence
of
israel
all
in
pursuit
she
claimed
of
appearing
the
most
persecuted
she
did
not
clarify
how
they
can
both
deny
the
holocaust
and
envy
it
there
is
nothing
genuine
about
these
politicians
ahmed
insisted
ahmed
is
a
frequent
contributor
to
fox
news
she
identifies
as
muslim
but
is
almost
always
in
agreement
with
those
criticizing
other
muslims
ahmed
has
tried
to
police
omar's
muslim
beliefs
calling
her
a
disgrace
to
islam
and
last
week
she
offered
fox
friends
her
endorsement
of
israel
permanently
barring
omar
from
entry
while
ahmed
has
in
the
past
been
critical
of
president
donald
trump's
muslim
travel
bans
it
has
only
been
because
she
believes
them
to
be
overbroad
because
they
don't
distinguish
between
islamists
and
other
muslims
she
has
otherwise
defended
trump
in
fact
in
the
wake
of
a
shooter
targeting
new
zealand
mosques
and
citing
trump
in
his
manifesto
ahmed
nevertheless
insisted
that
his
administration
is
not
islamophobic
just
last
week
she
praised
trump
for
being
extremely
aggressive
to
protect
religious
freedom
of
christians
christianity
is
important
to
protect
she
explained
because
it's
what
props
up
democracy
in
muslim-majority
countries
if
christianity
is
not
surviving
democracy
is
not
surviving
she
said
it's
important
to
note
that
ingraham
did
not
seem
to
acknowledge
ahmed's
reference
to
holocaust
envy
nor
her
accusation
that
the
congresswomen
are
holocaust
deniers
instead
she
simply
agreed
with
ahmed's
premise
that
more
democratic
leaders
should
be
calling
out
the
congresswomen
omar
has
previously
called
out
advertisers
that
support
fox
news
not
to
underwrite
hate
speech
