democratic
contenders
take
aim
at
trump-backed
keystone
xl
pipeline
pipeline
projects
have
become
a
flashpoint
between
trump
and
some
democrats
rejecting
the
controversial
keystone
xl
pipeline
project
could
be
the
next
environmental
litmus
test
for
democratic
candidates
hoping
to
beat
president
donald
trump
in
at
least
two
democratic
hopefuls
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
and
gov
jay
inslee
d-wa
have
formally
committed
to
opposing
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
should
they
be
elected
president
after
calls
to
do
so
from
indigenous
tribes
and
other
activists
on
tuesday
the
land
and
water
protection
group
bold
nebraska
announced
that
warren
had
become
the
first
democratic
candidate
to
take
the
nokxl
pledge
that
pledge
commits
signatories
to
reversing
trump's
approval
for
keystone
xl
and
stopping
the
project
entirely
on
day
one
in
office
environmental
organizations
tribes
ranchers
farmers
and
other
activist
groups
have
all
expressed
support
for
the
effort
the
pipeline
project
has
strong
backing
from
the
trump
administration
so
eyes
are
now
on
other
contenders
to
see
whether
they
join
warren
and
inslee
in
the
pledge
especially
as
environmental
issues
become
increasingly
important
to
voters
u.s.
presidents
are
not
empowered
to
write
up
proclamations
that
give
big
oil
a
free
ride
and
bypass
our
nation's
bedrock
environmental
laws
written
to
protect
our
water
land
clean
air
and
a
livable
climate
the
nokxl
pledge
reads
inslee
who
has
devoted
his
entire
campaign
to
tackling
climate
change
also
tweeted
his
support
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
is
a
disaster
waiting
to
happen
where
do
i
sign
the
candidate
asked
shortly
after
warren's
support
was
confirmed
keystone
xl
has
been
a
source
of
contention
for
years
owned
by
transcanada
the
proposed
oil
pipeline
would
connect
terminals
in
alberta
canada
to
nebraska
going
through
montana
and
south
dakota
the
pipeline
would
notably
go
through
nebraska's
ecologically
sensitive
sandhills
region
home
to
endangered
plant
species
and
an
area
that
has
been
designated
a
national
natural
landmark
opponents
say
the
pipeline
poses
significant
risks
to
both
public
health
and
the
environment
even
as
its
backers
argue
that
the
project
will
provide
necessary
energy
for
the
country
facing
pressure
from
environmentalists
the
obama
administration
rejected
the
pipeline
in
following
initial
approval
from
the
state
department
among
the
reasons
cited
for
the
rejection
were
concerns
about
climate
change
but
trump
has
sought
to
undo
this
and
push
the
project
forward
after
facing
legal
setbacks
and
repeated
challenges
from
opponents
trump
in
march
issued
a
new
permit
allowing
the
pipeline
to
proceed
while
litigation
over
the
pipeline
is
likely
to
continue
into
the
foreseeable
future
keystone
xl
naysayers
see
democratic
opposition
as
one
of
their
best
chances
for
halting
the
project
permanently
and
that
sentiment
extends
to
other
pipelines
as
well
in
addition
to
keystone
xl
the
pledge
supported
by
warren
and
inslee
also
calls
for
revoking
the
permit
for
the
dakota
access
pipeline
dapl
which
runs
from
north
dakota
through
several
states
ending
in
illinois
indigenous
protestors
have
long
argued
that
the
pipeline
poses
outsized
risks
to
water
sources
activists
are
moreover
scrutinizing
other
pipelines
including
enbridge's
line
oil
pipeline
which
currently
runs
from
alberta
to
wisconsin
with
a
new
route
proposed
that
has
generated
opposition
in
minnesota
fracked
gas
pipelines
in
appalachia
are
also
a
source
of
concern
as
are
plans
to
expand
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exports
groups
like
bold
nebraska
say
they
want
presidential
candidates
to
stand
against
all
of
these
efforts
polling
shows
that
americans
consider
climate
change
one
of
the
most
important
issues
facing
the
country
with
many
saying
they
worry
about
global
warming
and
want
to
see
a
president
pursue
climate
action
the
trump
administration's
support
for
fossil
fuels
and
the
ongoing
rollback
of
many
key
environmental
regulations
have
bolstered
some
democrats
many
contenders
have
expressed
support
for
the
green
new
deal
resolution
a
plan
to
rapidly
decarbonize
the
economy
and
a
number
have
released
their
own
sweeping
plans
to
address
climate
change
not
all
democratic
hopefuls
however
would
move
to
ban
fossil
fuels
some
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
have
given
mixed
answers
when
pushed
about
the
role
they
expect
energy
sources
like
oil
and
gas
to
play
in
the
coming
years
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
is
inslee
who
has
pushed
to
be
completely
free
from
oil
and
gas
in
years
with
coal
phased
out
in
a
decade
regardless
of
their
differences
virtually
all
democratic
candidates
have
called
for
net-zero
u.s.
emissions
by
mid-century
opposing
major
pipeline
projects
puts
some
muscle
behind
that
commitment
indicating
that
more
democrats
could
follow
in
the
steps
of
warren
and
inslee
update
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
quickly
became
the
third
candidate
to
sign
on
to
the
nokxl
pledge
on
wednesday
mark
hefflinger
communications
director
for
bold
nebraska
told
thinkprogress
that
the
momentum
is
promising
we're
confident
that
all
of
the
other
candidates
will
take
this
pledge
to
stand
with
family
farmers
tribal
nations
and
citizens
concerned
about
the
climate
risks
of
the
kxl
and
