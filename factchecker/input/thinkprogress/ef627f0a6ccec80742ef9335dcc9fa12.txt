shakeup
of
immigration
court
system
threatens
migrants
due
process
congress
has
given
migrants
rights
a
new
rule
appears
aimed
at
making
sure
they
don't
exercise
them
migrants
may
soon
have
a
much
harder
time
finding
lawyers
and
understanding
their
rights
in
immigration
court
as
the
trump
administration
pursues
a
major
overhaul
of
the
agency
that
oversees
those
proceedings
the
crucial
office
that
provides
basic
legal
information
to
migrants
and
helps
connect
some
of
them
to
pro-bono
immigration
lawyers
will
be
merged
into
a
trump-created
unit
widely
viewed
as
the
nerve
center
of
his
immigration
power
grab
though
friday's
reorganization
rule
makes
no
specific
threat
to
shutter
those
legal
assistance
programs
the
president
has
wanted
to
kill
them
for
more
than
a
year
the
bureaucratic
reshuffle
leaves
the
assistance
programs
buried
deep
in
the
bowels
of
an
agency
that
today
never
does
anything
without
some
ulterior
political
motive
relating
to
the
restrictionist
immigration
agenda
retired
immigration
judge
paul
schmidt
told
reporters
friday
the
regulations
concern
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
eoir
where
the
work
of
applying
immigration
laws
to
individual
human
cases
gets
done
in
addition
to
burying
the
legal-assistance
work
in
a
team
trump
created
the
rule
endows
eoir's
director
with
vast
new
power
to
change
how
immigration
laws
are
applied
the
proposal
shows
the
trump
administration's
weaponization
of
eoir
as
a
means
of
implementing
restrictionist
policies
by
precedent
decision
without
going
through
legislation
or
rule
making
schmidt
told
reporters
in
an
email
immigration
courts
despite
their
name
are
not
independent
judicial
forums
and
because
deportation
is
a
civil
proceeding
rather
than
a
criminal
one
migrants
who
come
before
the
courts
are
not
guaranteed
counsel
any
given
migrant's
ability
to
vindicate
the
rights
they
do
have
in
immigration
court
therefore
ends
up
resting
in
many
cases
with
the
presiding
judge
if
the
law
says
a
given
migrant's
case
might
merit
a
stay
of
deportation
or
other
relief
and
an
immigration
judge
applies
the
law
accordingly
the
system
slows
down
and
fewer
people
are
evicted
from
the
country
the
trump
administration
has
repeatedly
pushed
immigration
judges
to
set
aside
those
legal
niceties
in
favor
of
rapid
removal
orders
for
almost
everyone
they
see
judges
now
face
discipline
if
they
fail
to
clear
cases
per
calendar
year
a
speed
judges
have
repeatedly
said
makes
a
mockery
of
due
process
the
big
winner
in
friday's
order
is
eoir's
new
office
of
policy
created
at
the
start
of
president
donald
trump's
term
that
team
will
take
over
management
of
a
key
legal
orientation
program
for
giving
migrants
a
basic
overview
of
the
legal
process
they're
facing
and
the
rights
they
have
within
it
the
office
of
policy
has
become
the
prime
mover
behind
various
trump
efforts
to
create
a
deportation
assembly
line
that
favors
speedy
removals
over
the
fuller
individual
consideration
envisioned
in
immigration
law
experts
said
the
office
of
policy
has
in
many
ways
led
the
trump
administration's
agenda
to
reduce
the
independence
of
the
immigration
court
system
american
immigration
council
policy
analyst
aaron
reichlin-melnick
said
in
an
interview
currently
eoir's
office
of
legal
access
programs
helps
link
some
migrants
to
pro-bono
immigration
attorneys
as
part
of
its
legal
orientation
work
having
a
lawyer
is
arguably
the
single
most
important
factor
in
determining
whether
someone
is
allowed
to
remain
in
the
united
states
at
the
conclusion
of
their
immigration
case
reichlin-melnick
said
the
new
rule
moves
the
pro-bono
program
into
the
trump-created
policy
office
along
with
the
legal
orientation
system
that's
meant
to
give
migrants
without
attorneys
a
fighting
chance
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
the
doj
is
killing
the
pro-bono
system
or
the
legal
orientation
program
reichlin-melnick
stressed
but
we
know
in
the
past
this
is
something
the
administration
has
gone
after
he
said
noting
that
the
white
house
tried
to
defund
the
legal
orientation
work
in
only
for
a
bipartisan
coalition
of
lawmakers
to
insist
it
continue
it's
a
popular
program
with
pretty
much
everybody
he
said
except
those
inside
the
trump
administration
who
think
we
shouldn't
be
spending
money
on
helping
people
know
their
rights
because
that
slows
things
down
the
same
office
of
policy
is
widely
blamed
for
concocting
the
case-per-year
standard
that
judges
and
experts
view
as
an
intentional
demolition
of
immigrants
due
process
rights
it
is
also
seen
as
the
driving
force
behind
a
new
piece
of
technology
that
displays
a
speed
gauge
on
judges
desks
while
they
work
glaring
red
when
they
take
the
time
to
explore
factual
disputes
or
delve
into
process
issues
of
a
given
case
and
fall
behind
the
administration's
speed
requirements
that
kind
of
pressure
creates
problems
even
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
people
are
going
to
explicitly
deny
cases
because
of
it
reichlin-melnick
said
even
the
most
well-minded
people
are
affected
by
someone
essentially
standing
behind
them
tapping
their
watch
the
case-completion
rule
in
question
technically
came
from
a
different
eoir
office
but
trump's
new
policy
office
is
understood
to
have
crafted
it
and
passed
it
to
the
appropriate
internal
authority
to
promulgate
last
year
national
association
of
immigration
judges
union
head
ashley
tabaddor
urged
her
colleagues
to
take
whatever
time
a
case
requires
regardless
of
the
administration's
pressure
tactics
this
summer
the
administration
announced
its
intention
to
dissolve
the
naij
and
strip
judges
of
labor
protections
these
maneuvers
create
the
appearance
of
coercion
of
a
professional
legal
staff
who
are
responsible
for
applying
the
law
to
a
complex
array
of
individual
circumstances
reichlin-melnick
said
a
political
team
that
isn't
getting
the
results
it
wants
from
immigration
courts
when
they
scrutinize
the
facts
is
turning
to
threats
judges
can
be
denied
raises
or
terminated
outright
over
the
running-clock
rules
and
increasing
the
authority
its
office
of
policy
holds
over
those
judges
the
new
rule
raises
a
number
of
concerns
about
conflict
of
interest
that
could
play
out
maybe
they
won't
at
this
point
it's
a
little
bit
premature
to
panic
or
to
make
large
declaratory
statements
about
how
this
rule
will
affect
the
process
he
said
but
it
certainly
raises
concerns
former
immigration
judge
schmidt
was
blunter
the
new
policy
office's
primary
role
appears
to
be
to
ensure
that
eoir
functions
as
an
adjunct
of
dhs
enforcement
and
that
any
adjudication
trends
that
enhance
due
process
or
vindicate
immigrants
rights
are
quickly
identified
so
that
they
can
be
wiped
out
by
precedents
or
policy
changes
schmidt
wrote
look
for
the
eoir
director
over
time
to
reinsert
himself
in
the
adjudicative
activities
of
eoir
he
wrote
for
the
purpose
of
insuring
subservience
to
the
administration's
political
enforcement
priorities
