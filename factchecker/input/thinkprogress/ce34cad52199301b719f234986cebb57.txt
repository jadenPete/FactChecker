it
won
video
of
the
year
on
monday
night
swift
said
in
this
video
several
points
were
made
so
you
voting
for
this
video
means
that
you
want
a
world
where
we're
all
treated
equally
under
the
law
lgbtq
people
and
trans
women
of
color
in
particular
face
discrimination
in
housing
and
employment
as
well
as
in
restaurants
and
bars
last
weekend
a
group
of
trans
women
were
thrown
out
of
a
los
angeles
bar
las
perlas
after
a
straight
couple
began
hurling
transphobic
and
threatening
statements
at
them
such
as
you
are
all
dudes
and
we
will
come
back
and
kill
you
a
male
patron
slapped
one
of
the
women
in
the
bar
and
the
couple
became
aggressive
the
women
said
the
bar
staff
chose
to
remove
the
couple
and
the
trans
women
being
attacked
this
incident
of
security
dragging
trans
patrons
out
of
the
bar
was
caught
on
film
video
showed
one
man
wrapping
his
arm
around
the
neck
of
one
of
the
women
to
lead
her
out
another
can
be
seen
repeatedly
grabbing
the
shoulders
and
arms
of
one
woman
as
she
told
him
to
take
his
hands
off
of
her
the
incident
between
the
trans
patrons
and
the
couple
is
being
investigated
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
as
a
possible
hate
crime
on
saturday
protesters
went
to
las
perlas
to
protest
the
staff's
treatment
of
the
group
las
perlas
initially
attempted
to
defend
its
actions
but
on
sunday
it
released
a
revised
statement
which
read
our
first
and
primary
concern
and
has
been
from
day
one
is
to
operate
a
safe
place
for
all
people
period
no
exceptions
we
regret
that
didn't
happen
friday
night
and
want
to
apologize
to
all
of
our
guests
including
the
transgender
community
a
community
who
has
come
to
our
bar
as
well
as
works
there
another
incident
involving
poor
treatment
of
a
trans
women
by
staff
at
an
establishment
occurred
last
year
when
charlotte
clymer
a
trans
woman
was
stopped
by
a
male
attendant
when
she
tried
to
use
the
bathroom
at
the
cuba
libre
restaurant
in
washington
d.c.
the
restaurant's
manager
threatened
to
call
the
police
and
ultimately
asked
her
to
leave
the
restaurant
ultimately
had
to
pay
a
penalty
as
part
of
a
settlement
for
violating
d.c.
s
nondiscrimination
provisions
right
now
lgbtq
people
have
to
rely
on
a
patchwork
of
state
protections
to
protect
them
against
discrimination
in
public
accommodations
such
as
restaurants
and
bars
the
equality
act
would
change
that
at
present
protections
under
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
cover
race
color
religion
and
national
origin
jenny
pizer
law
and
policy
director
for
lambda
legal
said
las
perlas
is
exactly
the
kind
of
establishment
the
framers
of
the
law
had
in
mind
when
they
took
on
racial
segregation
in
hotels
and
motels
restaurants
and
bars
and
public
transportation
although
the
trans
women
who
were
thrown
out
of
the
restaurant
have
protections
in
their
state
there
are
many
trans
women
across
the
country
who
don't
the
equality
act
would
include
sex
under
the
current
definition
of
public
accommodations
it
would
also
expand
the
definition
of
public
accommodations
to
cover
retail
businesses
professional
services
and
some
other
types
of
businesses
they
understood
that
everyone
needs
equal
access
to
these
businesses
in
order
to
move
freely
and
participate
fully
in
public
life
pizer
said
of
the
authors
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
but
they
didn't
set
out
to
address
the
many
types
of
discrimination
against
women
in
these
public
spaces
which
means
we
have
not
been
able
to
make
the
legal
arguments
about
sex
discrimination
against
lgbtq
people
in
public
spaces
that
we
make
about
employment
healthcare
housing
credit
and
education
she
added
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
the
equality
act
is
needed
with
great
urgency
in
the
many
states
that
lack
this
protection
in
state
law
the
trans
women
ejected
from
las
perlas
in
los
angeles
have
legal
recourse
against
that
business
because
california
does
forbid
gender
identity
discrimination
by
places
of
public
accommodation
everyone
everywhere
needs
that
same
protection
only
states
two
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
passed
laws
explicitly
prohibiting
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
in
employment
according
to
the
movement
advancement
project
twenty-one
states
and
d.c.
have
laws
explicitly
prohibiting
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
in
housing
and
states
and
d.c.
explicitly
prohibit
discrimination
in
public
accommodations
fifteen
states
have
non-discrimination
laws
covering
credit
discrimination
in
october
the
u.s.
supreme
court
will
hear
arguments
about
whether
lgbtq
workers
are
protected
by
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
many
lgbtq
advocates
and
legal
experts
argue
that
case
law
establishes
these
protections
already
exist
under
the
law
if
the
court
rules
against
lgbtq
workers
it
would
make
the
equality
act
even
more
critical
for
congress
to
pass
