israel
bucks
trump
but
rep
tlaib
still
won't
visit
the
michigan
democrat
says
she
will
not
go
under
the
circumstances
president
donald
trump's
seemingly
successful
push
to
get
israel
to
punish
two
of
his
critics
on
hit
a
snag
on
friday
the
country's
government
reversed
its
earlier
decision
and
decided
to
allow
rep
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
to
visit
her
family
in
the
west
bank
after
all
trump
was
reportedly
behind
israel's
announcement
on
thursday
that
it
would
not
permit
two
muslim-american
congresswomen
reps
tlaib
and
ilhan
omar
d-mn
to
enter
the
country
while
his
administration
falsely
claimed
that
the
president
had
not
urged
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
to
make
the
decision
this
was
contradicted
by
reporting
a
former
israeli
ambassador
and
trump's
own
tweet
it
would
show
great
weakness
if
israel
allowed
rep
omar
and
rep
tlaib
to
visit
trump
had
proclaimed
netanyahu
originally
agreed
to
bar
omar
and
tlaib
from
entering
israel
based
on
their
support
for
the
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
bds
movement
an
effort
to
punish
israel
economically
for
its
treatment
of
palestinian
citizens
a
month
earlier
israeli
ambassador
ron
dermer
had
promised
israel's
law
denying
entry
to
bds
supporters
would
not
be
used
to
keep
out
tlaib
and
omar
as
a
sign
of
respect
for
the
u.s.
congress
no
member
of
the
u.s.
congress
had
ever
been
prohibited
from
entry
before
this
incident
israel's
decision
to
ban
the
pair
was
denounced
by
the
american
israel
public
affairs
committee
aipac
and
sen
marco
rubio
r-fl
cbs
news
reported
on
friday
that
israel
decided
to
give
tlaib
a
humanitarian
pass
so
she
could
visit
her
palestinian
grandmother
and
other
family
in
the
west
bank
aipac
tweeted
on
friday
to
commend
the
israeli
government
for
permitting
congresswoman
tlaib
to
visit
her
grandmother
but
tlaib
said
friday
that
she
would
not
make
the
trip
under
these
oppressive
conditions
as
of
now
omar
will
still
be
excluded
from
visiting
