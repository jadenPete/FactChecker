ryan
tried
to
take
away
coverage
from
million
americans
as
speaker
of
the
house
paul
ryan
r-wi
was
best
known
for
his
repeated
attempts
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
commonly
known
as
obamacare
and
take
away
health
insurance
coverage
from
tens
of
millions
of
americans
now
a
private
citizen
ryan
is
about
to
profit
from
his
own
legislative
failures
according
to
his
hometown
paper
ryan
has
joined
the
board
of
directors
at
shine
medical
technologies
the
janesville-based
company
makes
molybdenum-
a
radioactive
isotope
used
to
illuminate
bones
and
body
tissue
in
medical
tests
the
sorts
of
tests
typically
paid
for
by
health
insurance
plans
in
a
statement
announcing
the
news
the
company's
ceo
greg
piefer
said
the
former
term
congressman
and
vice
presidential
nominee
will
provide
critical
guidance
to
shine
as
we
expand
into
domestic
and
international
markets
that
require
deep
mastery
of
global
policy
economics
and
leadership
ryan
said
he
was
excited
to
be
joining
shine's
board
at
this
important
time
in
the
company's
development
ryan's
share
in
the
company's
profits
will
likely
be
higher
thanks
in
part
to
the
failure
of
his
own
signature
health
care
legislation
proposals
that
did
not
become
law
in
he
rammed
the
american
health
care
act
better
known
as
trumpcare
through
the
house
of
representatives
had
the
bill
not
died
in
the
senate
the
non-partisan
congressional
budget
office
predicted
it
would
have
left
million
more
americans
uninsured
ryan
also
spent
much
of
his
house
tenure
pushing
legislation
to
turn
federal
health
programs
like
medicaid
into
block
grants
which
would
have
capped
spending
had
either
of
these
efforts
become
law
it
would
likely
have
meant
much
less
demand
for
lifesaving
medical
tests
like
the
ones
that
utilize
shine's
products
earlier
this
year
ryan
also
joined
the
board
of
the
parent
company
for
