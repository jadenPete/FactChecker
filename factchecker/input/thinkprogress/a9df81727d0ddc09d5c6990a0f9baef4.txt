a
conservative
political
action
group
has
debuted
a
series
of
new
ads
attacking
democratic
candidates
for
tolerating
what
it
describes
as
rep
ilhan
omar's
d-mn
anti-semitic
slurs
the
attack
ads
were
released
by
the
american
action
network
a
group
founded
by
president
richard
nixon's
so-called
jew
counter
the
late
fred
malek
the
series
of
ads
specifically
attack
lawmakers
including
reps
abigail
spanberger
d-va
tom
malinowski
d-nj
haley
stevens
d-mi
and
dean
phillips
d-mn
demanding
they
call
for
omar
to
be
removed
from
the
foreign
affairs
committee
except
for
stevens
the
other
three
all
serve
on
the
committee
it's
time
to
stand
up
to
hate
the
ad
says
the
ads
refer
to
omar's
latest
comments
which
were
in
fact
from
five
months
ago
at
the
time
omar
publicly
objected
to
the
political
influence
in
this
country
that
says
it
is
ok
for
people
to
push
for
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country
referring
to
pro-israel
lobbying
by
the
american
israel
public
affairs
committee
why
is
it
okay
for
me
to
talk
about
the
influence
of
the
nra
national
rifle
association
of
fossil
fuel
industries
or
big
pharma
and
not
talk
about
a
powerful
lobbying
group
that
is
influencing
policies
she
said
omar
was
accused
of
reinforcing
an
anti-semitic
trope
that
jews
harbor
dual
loyalty
to
both
the
united
states
and
israel
when
criticized
however
she
insisted
that
opposing
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
and
the
occupation
of
palestine
is
not
the
same
as
being
anti-semitic
omar
later
apologized
for
the
remarks
president
donald
trump
himself
came
under
fire
just
last
week
after
he
used
a
similar
claim
to
criticize
democrats
speaking
with
reporters
the
president
suggested
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
are
showing
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
asked
about
the
comment
the
following
day
trump
made
clear
that
he
meant
that
such
an
individual
would
be
very
very
disloyal
to
israel
and
to
the
jewish
people
the
republican-aligned
american
action
network
did
not
put
out
any
ads
criticizing
the
president's
remarks
the
american
action
network
was
founded
in
by
malek
who
died
earlier
this
year
malek
was
responsible
for
carrying
out
one
of
the
last
state-sanctioned
acts
of
anti-semitism
in
nixon
who
believed
that
democratic
jews
working
in
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
bls
were
trying
to
rig
unemployment
reports
in
a
way
that
politically
hurt
him
tasked
malek
with
rooting
out
important
jewish
officials
four
such
officials
were
demoted
following
that
witch
hunt
though
malek
claimed
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subsequent
demotions
memos
later
showed
that
he
was
specifically
responsible
for
them
the
american
action
network
ads
released
this
month
represent
the
latest
attempt
to
weaponize
claims
of
anti-semitism
against
one
of
the
only
two
muslim
women
in
congress
this
week
the
alabama
republican
party
approved
a
resolution
calling
on
omar
to
be
expelled
from
congress
describing
her
rhetoric
as
running
counter
to
american
values
and
patriotism
omar
was
not
impressed
noting
the
state
party's
past
support
for
accused
child
molester
roy
moore
in
his
failed
senate
bid
several
years
ago
the
american
action
network
also
put
out
ads
attacking
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
which
portrayed
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
as
a
commie
dictator
