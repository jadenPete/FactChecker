trump
praises
conservative
radio
host
who
called
him
the
second
coming
of
god
king
of
israel
the
president's
comments
come
one
day
after
he
insulted
millions
of
jews
for
showing
great
disloyalty
by
voting
democrat
president
donald
trump
on
wednesday
morning
thanked
conservative
radio
host
wayne
allyn
root
who
this
week
called
the
president
king
of
israel
and
claimed
jewish
people
in
israel
all
love
him
they
love
him
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
they
love
him
like
he
is
the
second
coming
of
god
but
american
jews
don't
know
him
or
like
him
they
don't
even
know
what
they're
doing
or
saying
anymore
it
makes
no
sense
trump
tweeted
quoting
root
but
that's
ok
if
he
keeps
doing
what
he's
doing
he's
good
for
all
jews
blacks
gays
everyone
and
more
importantly
he's
good
for
everyone
in
america
who
wants
a
job
the
president
wrote
along
with
that
quote
thank
you
to
wayne
allyn
root
for
the
very
nice
words
he
finished
the
tweet
with
a
wow
before
tagging
conservative
news
outlets
newsmax
and
oann
as
well
as
fox
friends
for
the
uninitiated
root
is
a
former
libertarian
party
vice-presidential
nominee
who
has
a
long
and
sordid
history
of
promoting
conspiracy
theories
on
twitter
after
the
violence
at
the
unite
the
right
rally
in
charlottesville
root
tweeted
that
it
was
b.s.
probably
paid
actors
infiltrators
hired
by
soros
no
conservative
i've
ever
met
commits
violence
ever
after
the
mass
shooting
in
las
vegas
in
october
root
claimed
that
the
attack
was
clearly
coordinated
muslim
terror
and
then
refused
to
back
down
for
getting
it
wrong
root
is
also
a
fan
of
the
baseless
seth
rich
conspiracy
theory
which
falsely
claims
the
former
dnc
staffer
was
killed
for
leaking
internal
information
to
wikileaks
during
the
election
but
root's
way
with
words
goes
far
beyond
just
posting
about
bogus
conspiracies
on
twitter
as
right
wing
watch
noted
when
student
mollie
tibbetts
was
murdered
last
july
after
disappearing
while
jogging
allen
questioned
why
she'd
decided
to
jog
outside
in
the
first
place
and
said
she
should've
gotten
a
treadmill
so
she
could
watch
tv
and
jog
instead
why
are
you
jogging
outdoors
where
there's
a
chance
some
crazy
person
can
attack
you
allen
said
we
don't
live
in
a
country
that's
safe
what
can
i
tell
you
it's
terrible
and
why
isn't
it
safe
because
democrats
have
an
open
border
and
there's
too
many
bad
people
coming
into
this
country
allen
then
claimed
he
worked
out
every
day
at
a
gym
using
the
bike
elliptical
and
treadmill
and
said
he
would
never
run
outside
because
he
might
get
run
over
by
a
mack
truck
trump's
self-congratulatory
tweets
about
jewish
people
come
on
the
heels
of
his
own
disparaging
comments
about
several
million
american
jews
who
he
accused
this
week
of
being
either
stupid
or
showing
great
disloyalty
because
they
tended
to
vote
democrat
overwhelmingly
and
thus
supported
the
supposedly
anti-semitic
agenda
of
reps
ilhan
omar
d-mn
and
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
five
years
ago
the
concept
of
even
talking
about
this
even
three
years
ago
of
cutting
off
aid
to
israel
because
of
two
people
that
hate
israel
and
hate
jewish
people
i
can't
believe
we're
even
having
this
conversation
he
said
speaking
to
reporters
in
the
oval
office
tuesday
where
has
the
democratic
party
gone
where
have
they
gone
where
they're
defending
these
two
people
over
the
state
of
israel
i
think
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
it
shows
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
he
added
the
president
doubled
down
on
that
claim
wednesday
morning
rep
tlaib
wants
to
cut
off
aid
to
israel
this
is
the
new
face
of
the
democrat
party
trump
tweeted
read
the
aoc
plus
statements
on
their
hatred
of
jews
and
israel
