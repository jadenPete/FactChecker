of
the
year

july
has
broken
all
records
for
the
hottest
month
with
temperatures
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
above
the
th
century
average
noaa's
calculations
confirm
the
findings
of
three
other
recently
released
data
sets
independent
findings
from
the
copernicus
climate
change
service
a
european
climate
agency
japan
meteorological
agency
and
berkeley
earth
all
show
that
last
month
was
the
warmest
on
earth
since
record-keeping
began
according
to
data
from
berkeley
earth
for
instance
last
month
was
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
above
pre-industrial
levels
just
shy
of
the
paris
agreement's
aspirational
target
of
limiting
global
warming
to
degrees
in
a
statement
following
the
release
of
the
copernicus
data
u.n.
secretary
general
ant
nio
guterres
said
we
have
always
lived
through
hot
summers
but
this
is
not
the
summer
of
our
youth
this
is
not
your
grandfather's
summer
if
this
year's
unprecedented
heat
continues
it
will
likely
result
in
being
the
hottest
five
years
on
record
the
previous
hottest
month
ever
recorded
was
july
and
nine
of
the
hottest
julys
ever
have
all
happened
since
july
has
re-written
climate
history
with
dozens
of
new
temperature
records
at
local
national
and
global
level
petteri
taalas
secretary
general
of
the
world
meteorological
organization
said
in
a
statement
earlier
this
month
indeed
the
summer
of
will
be
remembered
for
arctic
fires
melting
antarctic
sea
ice
and
dangerous
heat
waves
across
several
continents
iceland
for
instance
officially
lost
its
first
glacier
to
climate
change
scientists
will
be
installing
a
plaque
this
month
to
commemorate
the
sombre
milestone
it
reads
in
the
next
years
all
our
glaciers
are
expected
to
follow
the
same
path
this
monument
is
to
acknowledge
that
we
know
what
is
happening
and
what
needs
to
be
done
only
you
know
if
we
did
it
and
over
the
course
of
july
greenland's
ice
sheet
melted
dramatically
billion
tons
of
water
from
the
glaciers
flowed
into
the
north
atlantic
this
is
enough
to
raise
global
sea
levels
by
inches
millimeters
these
events
follow
last
year's
summer
which
was
similarly
filled
with
rare
but
devastating
late-season
hurricanes
and
historic
deadly
wildfires
all
trends
scientists
say
can
be
expected
in
a
warming
world
