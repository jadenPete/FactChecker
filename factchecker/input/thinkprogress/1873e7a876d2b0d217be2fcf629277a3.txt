legal
investigation
strategy
after
trump's
collapse
into
conspiracy
kellyanne
conway
rushes
to
her
boss's
defense
following
the
reported
suicide
of
disgraced
financier
jeffrey
epstein
president
donald
trump
took
to
twitter
over
the
weekend
to
push
bizarre
baseless
conspiracies
that
the
clintons
may
be
behind
epstein's
death
trump's
attempts
to
fan
the
flames
of
conspiracy
without
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
back
up
his
claims
received
rounds
of
condemnation
across
the
u.s.
including
from
democratic
presidential
candidates
like
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
d-tx
and
sen
cory
booker
d-nj
however
according
to
the
white
house
trump's
collapse
into
conspiracy
wasn't
an
effort
to
stoke
his
far-right
conspiratorial
base
rather
according
to
presidential
adviser
kellyanne
conway
trump's
conspiracy
theories
are
actually
just
a
way
of
indicating
that
the
president
wants
a
thorough
investigation
of
epstein's
death
in
a
sunday
morning
appearance
on
fox
news
conway
defended
trump's
conspiracies
claiming
that
trump
just
wants
everything
to
be
investigated
conway
also
pointed
to
previous
and
ongoing
investigations
into
questions
about
the
trump
campaign's
relationship
with
russia
as
a
reason
to
pursue
further
investigation
into
epstein's
death
epstein
has
done
some
very
bad
things
over
a
number
of
years
so
let's
continue
to
investigate
that
she
added
conway
also
downplayed
links
between
trump
and
epstein
despite
documented
evidence
of
their
previous
connections
trying
to
connect
the
president
to
this
monster
from
years
ago
where
they're
seen
dancing
in
a
video
versus
other
people
who
were
actively
i
suppose
flying
around
with
this
monster
on
his
island
which
was
known
as
pedophilia
island
perhaps
there's
a
public
interest
in
knowing
more
about
that
she
said
there
is
of
course
no
evidence
that
epstein
was
secretly
murdered
let
alone
that
the
clintons
played
a
role
in
his
death
however
that
didn't
stop
trump
on
saturday
from
sharing
a
tweet
implying
just
the
opposite
as
it
is
few
other
prominent
republicans
if
any
have
followed
trump's
lead
in
trying
to
pin
epstein's
death
on
the
clintons
and
conway's
husband
had
a
different
take
on
the
matter
as
george
conway
wrote
on
twitter
let's
not
mince
words
here
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
a
nut
job
all
told
kellyanne
conway's
statements
regarding
the
president's
behavior
were
one
of
the
few
options
for
defending
a
man
who
is
now
accusing
a
former
president
of
premeditated
murder
all
in
order
to
cover
up
supposed
sex
crimes
