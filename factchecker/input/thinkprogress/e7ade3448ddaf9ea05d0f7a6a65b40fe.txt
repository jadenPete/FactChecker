it
wasn't
a
debate
but
cnn's
hour
climate
forum
laid
bare
key
differences
among
democrats
democrats
range
in
how
they
see
nuclear
power
abolishing
the
filibuster
and
accountability
cnn's
seven-hour
town
hall
on
the
climate
crisis
wasn't
the
debate
many
activists
have
spent
months
calling
for
but
wednesday
night's
marathon
event
teased
out
notable
differences
among
democratic
presidential
contenders
giving
voters
a
taste
of
how
each
candidate
might
approach
climate
policy
if
elected
two
of
the
main
issues
where
candidates
staked
out
wildly
different
stances
were
nuclear
power
and
abolishing
the
filibuster
they
also
differed
on
fracking
the
process
of
extracting
natural
gas
to
be
used
for
energy
meanwhile
former
vice
president
joe
biden
took
heat
over
a
controversial
fundraiser
scheduled
for
thursday
night
and
hosted
by
an
oil
executive
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
criticized
the
forum's
focus
on
personal
sacrifices
like
giving
up
eating
meat
or
using
plastic
straws
arguing
instead
for
accountability
from
the
fossil
fuel
industry
in
back-to-back
segments
beginning
at
p
m
eastern
time
and
stretching
late
into
the
night
candidates
laid
out
their
climate
plans
and
responded
to
questions
from
moderators
and
selected
audience
members
climate
change
has
emerged
as
a
leading
issue
for
democratic
voters
and
in
many
ways
the
candidates
closely
align
leading
up
to
the
forum
all
of
the
candidates
had
released
their
own
sweeping
climate
plans
most
have
also
expressed
some
level
of
support
for
the
green
new
deal
a
proposal
to
rapidly
decarbonize
the
economy
while
ensuring
mass
job
creation
they
also
back
remaining
in
the
paris
climate
agreement
which
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
exit
and
gov
jay
inslee
d-wa
who
based
his
entire
campaign
around
addressing
global
warming
loomed
large
over
the
event
despite
dropping
out
of
the
presidential
race
last
month
on
wednesday
night
candidates
like
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-mn
and
former
housing
secretary
juli
n
castro
warmly
praised
inslee
and
warren
went
so
far
as
to
embrace
his
detailed
climate
policy
proposals
he
said
have
at
them
she
joked
they're
open-sourced
but
the
forum
allowed
space
for
presidential
hopefuls
to
flesh
out
key
differences
between
their
approaches
to
climate
action
early
in
the
evening
sen
kamala
harris
d-ca
said
she
would
eliminate
the
filibuster
in
order
to
ensure
climate
action
the
senate
procedural
rule
calls
for
votes
rather
than
a
simple
majority
if
lawmakers
fail
to
act
on
climate
change
as
president
of
the
united
states
i
am
prepared
to
get
rid
of
the
filibuster
to
pass
a
green
new
deal
harris
said
abolishing
the
filibuster
would
require
buy-in
from
the
senate
itself
making
the
process
complicated
but
many
activists
and
lawmakers
alike
have
argued
that
major
climate
action
will
not
pass
while
the
filibuster
remains
warren
has
called
for
ending
the
filibuster
and
numerous
other
candidates
have
said
they
are
open
to
the
possibility
however
not
everyone
is
on
board
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
balked
at
the
idea
during
his
round
of
questioning
what
i
have
said
is
we
need
major
filibuster
reform
budget
reconciliation
is
the
method
we
will
use
sanders
said
arguing
that
his
trillion
climate
plan
could
pass
without
abolishing
the
procedure
nuclear
power
also
emerged
as
a
divisive
topic
sanders
supports
ending
nuclear
power
in
around
a
decade
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
me
to
add
more
dangerous
waste
to
this
country
but
sen
cory
booker
d-nj
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
both
embraced
nuclear
energy
asserting
that
the
energy
source
which
currently
produces
of
the
nation's
electricity
remains
critical
to
achieving
net-zero
emissions
warren
struck
a
middle
tone
laying
out
temporary
support
for
nuclear
power
while
endorsing
no
new
nuclear
plants
she
said
she
supports
easing
away
from
nuclear
reliance
with
a
phase-out
complete
by
at
the
latest
some
candidates
also
staked
out
their
positions
on
fracking
just
prior
to
the
forum
sanders
called
for
all
democrats
to
back
a
federal
fracking
ban
warren's
campaign
has
said
she
would
support
such
a
ban
and
on
wednesday
night
harris
and
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
d-tx
made
similar
calls
klobuchar
and
biden
by
contrast
punted
on
the
issue
with
klobuchar
going
so
far
as
to
tout
natural
gas
as
a
transitional
fuel
bridging
the
move
away
from
fossil
fuels
and
towards
renewable
energy
while
candidates
disagreed
over
elements
of
policy
one
person
took
direct
hits
over
an
upcoming
fundraiser
biden
had
scheduled
a
thursday
event
with
andrew
goldman
co-founder
of
western
lng
a
fossil
fuel
company
like
many
contenders
biden
has
taken
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
pledge
which
swears
off
donations
from
fossil
fuel
companies
and
executives
when
cnn
host
anderson
cooper
confronted
biden
about
the
fundraiser
after
an
audience
member
raised
the
issue
the
former
vice
president
argued
that
goldman
is
not
a
fossil
fuel
executive
per
his
financial
disclosures
biden
then
said
he
would
need
to
do
more
research
about
goldman's
business
dealings
while
one
of
his
senior
advisers
symone
sanders
tweeted
in
defense
of
the
candidate
andrew
goldman
isn't
a
fossil
fuel
executive
he's
not
involved
in
the
day
to
day
operation
she
wrote
he's
not
on
the
board
of
the
company
nor
the
board
of
the
portfolio
company
goldman
is
listed
second
under
the
leadership
section
on
western
lng's
website
biden
has
previously
weathered
criticism
over
his
climate
bonafides
with
opponents
like
sanders
accusing
him
of
a
middle
of
the
road
approach
to
combatting
the
crisis
it
was
unclear
on
thursday
morning
whether
biden
might
still
be
attending
his
scheduled
evening
fundraiser
