you
know
if
we
did
it
scientists
write
dire
letter
to
the
future
about
climate
change
we
know
what
is
happening
and
know
what
needs
to
be
done
only
you
know
if
we
did
it
scientists
are
gathering
in
iceland
sunday
to
memorialize
okj
kull
the
country's
first
glacier
to
be
destroyed
by
global
warming
okj
kull
nicknamed
ok
lost
its
status
as
a
glacier
the
monument
being
unveiled
at
the
funeral
is
inscribed
with
an
ominous
warning
titled
a
letter
to
the
future
ok
is
the
first
icelandic
glacier
to
lose
its
status
as
a
glacier
it
states
in
english
and
icelandic
in
the
next
years
all
our
glaciers
are
expected
to
follow
the
same
path
this
monument
is
to
acknowledge
that
we
know
what
is
happening
and
know
what
needs
to
be
done
only
you
know
if
we
did
it
only
future
generations
will
know
if
we
did
it
if
we
melted
all
of
the
glaciers
raised
sea
level
tens
of
feet
destroyed
all
of
our
coastal
cities
and
ruined
our
livable
climate
but
the
truth
is
that
human-caused
global
warming
is
disintegrating
arctic
glaciers
and
the
great
ice
sheets
at
such
a
rapid
and
accelerating
pace
that
we
will
all
know
within
a
decade
whether
humanity
has
acted
fast
enough
to
avert
catastrophe
as
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
noaa
reported
in
december
arctic
air
temperatures
for
the
past
five
years
have
exceeded
all
previous
records
since
and
is
on
track
to
be
the
hottest
year
yet
noaa's
report
makes
clear
we're
in
an
all-but
irreversible
arctic
death
spiral
which
is
driving
more
extreme
weather
in
this
country
faster
sea
level
rise
everywhere
and
more
rapid
disintegration
of
the
carbon-rich
permafrost
which
in
turn
causes
even
faster
global
warming
prof
cymene
howe
of
rice
told
the
uk
guardian
last
month
that
the
plaque
would
be
the
first
to
a
glacier
lost
to
climate
change
anywhere
in
the
world
she
said
that
an
icelandic
colleague
told
her
memorials
are
not
for
the
dead
they
are
for
the
living
let's
hope
the
living
are
listening
