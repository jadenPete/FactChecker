white
supremacist
james
allsup
has
been
banned
from
youtube
allsup
who
marched
at
the
deadly
white
supremacist
rally
in
charlottesville
is
one
of
a
number
of
accounts
axed
just
days
after
facebook
and
instagram
pulled
the
plug
on
white
supremacist
james
allsup's
accounts
youtube
followed
suit
banning
allsup's
account
as
part
of
a
broader
crackdown
on
neo-fascist
and
white
nationalist
accounts
a
youtube
spokesperson
declined
to
comment
to
thinkprogress
specifically
on
allsup's
ban
but
pointed
to
youtube's
recent
efforts
to
enforce
a
crackdown
on
white
supremacist
content
allsup's
former
account
now
reads
that
the
account
has
been
terminated
for
a
violation
of
youtube's
terms
of
service
allsup's
removal
was
one
of
a
number
of
take-downs
yesterday
including
white
supremacist
organizations
like
vdare
the
ban
follows
a
litany
of
other
embarrassments
for
allsup
who
achieved
notoriety
for
marching
alongside
a
pro-white
group
in
the
deadly
white
supremacist
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
a
march
in
which
a
fellow
white
supremacist
killed
a
woman
with
his
car
allsup
had
previously
been
banned
by
companies
like
uber
and
twitter
which
suspended
allsup's
account
in
late
youtube's
ban
follows
an
earlier
move
to
demonetize
allsup's
account
removing
his
ability
to
run
ads
against
his
video
the
white
supremacist
said
that
led
to
a
significant
financial
hit
allsup
has
a
well-documented
history
of
public
white
supremacy
and
outright
bigotry
he's
claimed
membership
with
the
white
supremacist
identity
evropa
group
encouraging
other
members
of
the
group
to
join
local
republican
party
institutions
allsup
is
a
former
head
of
washington
state
university's
college
republican
chapter
according
to
the
inlander
a
newspaper
based
in
eastern
washington
allsup
has
not
only
called
for
voluntary
racial
segregation
but
has
claimed
there
are
intelligence
differences
between
the
races
before
his
twitter
was
removed
allsup
also
retweeted
white
supremacist
richard
spencer
countless
times
as
the
inlander
noted
allsup
also
appeared
on
a
neo-nazi
podcast
in
allsup
and
the
co-hosts
laugh
at
a
podcast
segment
joking
about
the
jew
york
times
and
using
slurs
like
kike
crack
head
n
ers
yid
bitch
and
faggots
the
newspaper
wrote
on
gab
a
social
media
platform
infested
with
fascists
and
white
supremacists
allsup
complained
that
his
means
to
exercise
his
political
voice
had
been
taken
away
from
him
of
course
there's
nothing
preventing
allsup
from
exercising
his
political
voice
on
other
sites
or
in
public
however
his
ability
to
use
youtube
as
a
platform
to
broadcast
his
bigotry
is
no
more
