from
decisions
involving
his
former
firm's
clients
for
two
years
bernhardt
was
also
not
able
to
meet
with
these
companies
unless
five
or
more
other
stakeholders
were
present
and
nothing
relating
specifically
to
the

was
discussed
but
all
of
this
is
set
to
change
on
august
prior
to
joining
the

worked
as
a

headquarters
during
his
time
in
the
trump
administration
bernhardt's
ethical
issues
have
taken
center
stage
he
has
so
many
potential
conflicts
of
interest
to
avoid
that
he
carries
around
a
card
listing
all
of
them
so
he
doesn't
forget
a
recent
analysis
by
the
center
for
american
progress
found
that
bernhardt
has
more
conflicts
of
interest
than
any
other

nominee

the
endangered

act
and
in
september
an
appearance
by

could
raise
conflicts-of-interest
concerns
