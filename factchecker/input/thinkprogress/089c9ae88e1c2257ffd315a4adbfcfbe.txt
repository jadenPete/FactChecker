even
big
oil
doesn't
like
the
epa's
methane
rollback
powerful
members
of
the
fossil
fuel
lobby
support
the
trump
administration's
rollback
but
not
all
of
the
industry
is
on
board
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
on
thursday
announced
it
will
reverse
obama-era
limitations
on
the
greenhouse
gas
methane
which
is
far
more
potent
than
carbon
dioxide
and
often
associated
with
fracking
in
a
statement
thursday
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
the
trump
administration
will
remove
unnecessary
and
duplicative
regulatory
burdens
from
the
oil
and
gas
industry
by
slashing
methane
regulations
a
number
of
major
fossil
fuel
corporations
have
objected
to
the
rollback
however
even
as
the
oil
and
gas
lobby
more
broadly
has
played
a
key
role
in
securing
the
move
meanwhile
environmental
activists
and
public-health
experts
have
expressed
alarm
at
the
potential
impacts
of
loosening
methane
regulations
under
existing
rules
fossil
fuel
companies
must
closely
monitor
methane
leaks
while
undergoing
frequent
inspections
the
new
rules
would
undo
these
processes
the
trump
administration
argued
that
the
federal
government
overstepped
its
authority
with
the
obama-era
regulations
instead
the
epa
will
regulate
ozone-forming
volatile
organic
compounds
or
vocs
which
are
released
as
a
byproduct
of
fuel-burning
the
agency
argues
that
regulating
vocs
will
be
a
more
effective
approach
to
targeting
methane
emissions
as
curbing
those
compounds
will
reduce
methane
at
the
same
time
epa
officials
also
believe
fossil
fuel
companies
will
voluntarily
keep
methane
emissions
low
due
to
cost
concerns
the
trump
administration
recognizes
that
methane
is
valuable
and
the
industry
has
an
incentive
to
minimize
leaks
and
maximize
its
use
said
wheeler
during
a
call
with
reporters
on
thursday
morning
anne
idsal
acting
assistant
administrator
for
the
epa's
office
of
air
and
radiation
argued
that
the
change
would
save
the
oil
and
natural
gas
industry
millions
in
a
boon
to
the
u.s.
economy
our
regulations
should
not
stifle
progress
idsal
said
going
on
to
assert
that
the
epa
has
received
mostly
positive
comments
from
business
interests
in
response
to
the
announcement
under
president
donald
trump
the
epa
has
repeatedly
sought
to
roll
back
or
weaken
environmental
regulations
often
to
the
benefit
of
the
fossil
fuel
industry
thursday's
move
marks
the
latest
in
a
long
series
of
similar
policy
decisions
but
activists
and
scientists
alike
have
expressed
major
alarm
over
the
methane
announcement
carbon
dioxide
remains
the
most
significant
greenhouse
gas
as
well
as
the
one
scientists
connect
most
often
to
global
warming
in
comparison
methane
is
not
emitted
in
very
large
amounts
and
the
gas
does
not
linger
in
the
atmosphere
for
as
long
as
carbon
dioxide
does
but
methane
is
deeply
potent
and
the
main
component
of
natural
gas
over
a
year
timespan
methane
has
around
times
the
heat-trapping
power
of
carbon
making
it
a
major
source
of
concern
when
it
comes
to
limiting
global
warming
in
the
united
states
methane
makes
up
about
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
with
much
of
that
associated
with
oil
and
gas
methane
is
a
byproduct
of
fracking
and
released
as
fossil
fuels
are
extracted
exposure
can
cause
a
range
of
health
symptoms
in
humans
including
dizziness
and
nausea
reactions
to
the
rollback
have
ranged
wildly
within
the
fossil
fuel
sector
small
and
independent
oil
and
gas
producers
for
example
have
lobbied
for
weakening
methane
regulations
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
has
also
long
pushed
for
loosening
the
regulations
and
greeted
the
news
in
addition
to
defending
the
decision
this
rollback
narrative
is
false
and
also
dismisses
the
effective
role
of
technology
innovation
and
industry
initiative
in
reducing
emissions
the
trade
association
tweeted
thursday
but
oil
and
gas
hasn't
lined
up
uniformly
behind
the
trump
administration
a
number
of
high-profile
oil
giants
including
exxonmobil
and
shell
have
opposed
the
epa's
efforts
to
weaken
methane
regulations
as
the
public
becomes
increasingly
concerned
about
climate
change
fossil
fuel
companies
have
touted
natural
gas
as
an
energy
source
cleaner
than
coal
often
cited
as
the
most
environmentally
dangerous
fossil
fuel
and
some
in
the
industry
have
worried
that
weakening
methane
regulations
will
be
a
blow
to
natural
gas
marketing
efforts
hurting
oil
and
gas
interests
at
a
time
when
renewable
energy
is
booming
in
response
to
thursday's
news
top
shell
executive
gretchen
watkins
asserted
that
her
company
plans
to
continue
reducing
its
methane
emissions
with
a
goal
of
cutting
its
net
carbon
footprint
by
mid-century
the
corporations
voicing
opposition
to
the
rollback
however
are
members
of
api
a
contradiction
that
has
drawn
ire
from
environmental
groups
on
thursday
many
of
these
organizations
slammed
the
epa's
move
as
a
handout
to
industry
at
the
expense
of
human
health
and
the
environment
the
proposed
elimination
of
critical
national
safeguards
against
oil
and
gas
methane
pollution
is
reckless
and
it
will
impact
millions
of
families
living
with
oil
and
gas
air
pollution
in
their
backyards
lauren
pagel
policy
director
for
the
group
earthworks
said
in
a
statement
the
league
of
conservation
votes
lcv
meanwhile
panned
the
trump
administration's
methane
move
as
tone-deaf
because
the
timing
coincides
with
the
anniversary
of
hurricane
katrina
which
left
louisiana
and
the
gulf
coast
devastated
almost
years
ago
scientists
attribute
worsening
hurricanes
to
climate
change
democrats
also
criticized
the
decision
rep
don
beyer
d-va
co-chair
of
the
congressional
safe
climate
caucus
said
that
the
rollback
would
endanger
american
lives
and
exacerbate
climate
change
it
should
be
telling
for
everyone
trying
to
make
sense
of
this
move
that
even
fossil
fuel
companies
think
they
are
going
too
far
beyer
said
in
a
statement
epa
officials
said
that
after
a
public
comment
period
and
review
the
new
rule
is
likely
to
be
finalized
in
