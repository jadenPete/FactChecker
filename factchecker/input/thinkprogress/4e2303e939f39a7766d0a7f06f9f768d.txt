economic
climate

new
study
finds
climate
inaction
could
slash
u.s.
gdp
up
to
by
the
end
of
the
century
failing
to
adequately
address
climate
change
could
do
significant
damage
to
the
u.s.
economy
and
to
global
markets
by
the
end
of

century
new
research
out
this
week
shows
the
study
published
in
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
nber
on
monday
is
not
the
first
to
highlight
the
dramatic
economic
cost
of
allowing
global
warming
to
go
unchecked
but
the
analysis
is
among
the
most
comprehensive
to
focus
on
the
sheer
scope
of
potential
impacts
emphasizing
that
climate
change
will
have
severe
implications
for
even
very
wealthy
nations
lower-income
countries
have
been
seen
as
the
primary
victims
of
rising
temperatures
with
research
repeatedly
indicating
that
tropical
islands
and
regions
like
south
asia
will
be
among
the
worst-hit
but
the
economic
data
from
nations
analyzed
for
the
nber
study
shows
that
no
country
would
be
spared
from
grave
climate
impacts
including
the
united
states
in
a
business
as
usual
scenario
in
the
report
global
emissions
would
remain
high
and
temperatures
would
continue
to
increase
at
around
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
per
year
a
scale
based
on
current
warming
levels
between
and
that
scenario
would
be
dire
bringing
the
world
to
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
of
warming
and
resulting
in
gdp
per
capita
worldwide
taking
a
blow
by
in
the
united
states
that
would
translate
to
a
deeper
real
income
cut
our
estimates
suggest
that
all
regions
cold
or
hot
and
rich
or
poor
would
experience
a
relatively
large
fall
in
gdp
per
capita
by
in
the
absence
of
climate
change
policies

the
research
team
comprised
of
university
of
cambridge
researchers
along
with
colleagues
from
the
united
states
taiwan
and
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
other
countries
that
could
see
gdp
losses
around
include
japan
india
and
new
zealand
canada
a
county
with
a
cold
climate
currently
experiencing
outsized
warming
could
experience
a
gdp
blow
switzerland's
economy
could
be
smaller
with
russia's
taking
a
dip
experts
almost
unanimously
agree
that
climate
change
will
require
significant
mitigation
and
adaptation
with
communities
forced
to
change
everything
from
transportation
norms
to
eating
habits
in
order
to
adjust
to
a
warmer
world
the
nber
study
acknowledges
that
these
shifts
will
help
countries
stave
off
some
impacts
however
scientific
consensus
indicates
that
it
takes
three
decades
to
truly
adapt
to
climate
change
during
which
point
warming
only
continues
requiring
further
adaptations
the
study
also
takes
a
close
look
at
the
united
states
nodding
to
the
importance
of
analyzing
geographically-diverse
nations
by
concentrating
on
the
u.s.
we
were
able
to
compare
whether
economic
activity
in
hot
or
wet
areas
responds
to
temperature
fluctuations
around
historical
norms
in
the
same
way
as
that
in
cold
or
dry
areas
within
a
single
large
nation
said
kamiar
mohaddes
co-author
of
the
study
and
a
member
of
cambridge's
faculty
of
economics
in
a
statement
looking
at
the
contiguous
united
states
the
researchers
analyzed
a
number
of
sectors
including
agriculture
manufacturing
mining
trade
and
retail
they
found
that
every
single
sector
would
see
impacts
from
at
least
one
aspect
of
climate
change
including
disasters
like
flooding
and
general
fluctuations
in
heat
those
impacts
could
ultimately
cause
economic
problems
on
a
staggering
scale
heavy
rainfall
prevents
mountain
access
for
mining
and
affects
commodity
prices
cold
snaps
raise
heating
bills
and
high
street
spending
drops
said
mohaddes
heatwaves
cause
transport
networks
to
shut
down
all
these
things
add
up
but
the
study
also
offers
a
silver
lining
the
researchers
mapped
out
a
scenario
in
which
the
world
gets
its
act
together
and
adheres
to
the
paris
agreement
that
pact
seeks
to
keep
the
world
from
passing
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
of
global
warming
over
preindustrial
temperatures
in
the
more
optimistic
scenario
global
gdp
loss
could
be
limited
to
around
the
nber
study
finds
the
united
states
would
see
its
gdp
shrink
less
than
as
would
canada
mohaddes
pointed
to
that
outcome
as
far
more
preferable
and
argued
that
meeting
the
paris
agreement's
goals
is
a
good
start
if
affluent
nations
want
to
avoid
economic
crisis
that
might
be
easier
said
than
done
president
donald
trump's
administration
has
touted
climate
impacts
as
a
potential
source
of
economic
gain
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
argued
in
may
that
melting
sea
ice
in
the
arctic
could
present
new
opportunities
for
trade
to
the
advantage
of
countries
like
the
united
states
trump
himself
has
said
he
will
withdraw
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
arguing
that
the
pact's
climate
action
agenda
is
too
costly
for
the
