kentucky
coal
miners
protest
as
executives
leave
them
in
the
lurch
workers
are
suffering
as
coal
spirals
kentucky
coal
miners
have
spent
days
blocking
a
railroad
that
serves
coal
trains
in
harlan
county
as
they
demand
unpaid
wages
from
their
bankrupt
employer
the
dispute
highlights
the
disproportionate
impact
the
collapsing
coal
industry
is
having
on
its
workers
many
of
whom
are
caught
in
the
crossfire
coal
has
been
on
the
decline
for
years
with
five
major
coal
producers
all
filing
for
bankruptcy
this
year
alone
as
that
spiral
has
played
out
coal
companies
have
denied
workers
backpay
in
addition
to
voiding
union
contracts
in
certain
cases
some
activists
say
this
trend
enforces
the
need
for
protections
for
frontline
communities
from
those
on
the
coast
impacted
by
sea
level
rise
to
workers
affected
by
the
transition
to
clean
energy
laid
out
in
proposals
like
the
green
new
deal
many
also
say
the
collapse
of
coal
serves
as
an
indictment
of
lawmakers
including
president
donald
trump
the
president
has
kept
close
ties
with
coal
executives
even
as
they
come
under
fire
for
abandoning
their
workers
coal
executives
are
raking
in
money
even
while
their
businesses
fail
and
the
promises
they've
made
to
mining
communities
are
broken
time
and
time
again

on
friday
blackjewel
the
nation's
sixth-largest
coal
producer
abruptly
declared
bankruptcy
last
month
imperiling
the
jobs
of
well
over
coal
miners
in
several
states
including
kentucky
that
move
impacted
roughly
a
quarter
of
all
miners
in
southeastern
harlan
county
where
more
than
of
the
population
lived
below
the
poverty
line
as
of
the
census
the
company
did
not
post
a
payment
bond
with
kentucky
as
is
required
by
state
law
a
move
that
would
have
covered
a
month
of
payroll
for
impacted
workers
when
blackjewel
declared
bankruptcy
miners
say
their
paychecks
bounced
some
also
say
their
k
contributions
have
not
been
credited
to
their
accounts
for
months
fed
up
miners
camped
out
on
monday
on
top
of
a
railroad
track
in
an
effort
to
block
the
path
of
a
coal
train
many
have
said
they
will
not
leave
until
they
have
some
guarantee
of
payment
allowing
them
to
afford
medical
expenses
monthly
bills
and
other
critical
needs
while
the
protesting
miners
are
not
protected
by
a
union
united
mine
workers
of
america
umwa
members
have
expressed
solidarity
and
came
to
assist
their
industry
colleagues
their
fight
is
our
fight
the
union
asserted
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
local
reporters
on
the
scene
of
the
protest
said
that
miners
and
their
supporters
have
endured
hot
weather
coupled
with
pouring
rain
over
the
course
of
the
week
as
they
demand
their
wages
miners
have
allowed
the
train
company
csx
to
move
engines
but
not
the
coal
workers
argue
that
since
they
are
the
ones
to
have
mined
the
resource
they
should
be
paid
for
it
the
stand-off
is
the
latest
flashpoint
for
the
coal
industry
which
has
largely
been
dethroned
by
the
rise
of
cheaper
renewables
and
natural
gas
and
as
coal
companies
have
collapsed
workers
have
been
hit
hardest
companies
like
westmoreland
which
declared
bankruptcy
last
october
have
walked
away
from
union
contracts
leaving
many
miners
in
dire
financial
straits
some
without
any
union
obligations
have
simply
filed
for
bankruptcy
without
paying
their
workers
leaving
money
with
executives
and
not
with
miners
as
is
the
case
with
blackjewel's
kentucky
workers
the
fact
that
a
millionaire
is
refusing
to
pay
these
miners
for
their
hard
work
shows
yet
again
that
for
these
coal
executives
their
profits
always
come
before
the
health
and
well-being
of
everyone
else
said
price
the
appalachian
field
organizer
this
tension
has
also
spilled
into
federal
politics
last
week
appalachian
coal
miners
suffering
from
black
lung
came
to
washington
d.c.
to
lobby
congress
for
help
their
trip
coincided
with
trump's
visit
to
west
virginia
for
a
fundraiser
hosted
by
bob
murray
the
head
of
coal
company
murray
energy
trump
has
repeatedly
fought
to
keep
the
coal
industry
alive
going
so
far
as
to
push
for
a
government
bailout
of
both
coal
and
nuclear
which
is
also
struggling
but
the
president
has
not
commented
on
the
protest
in
kentucky
or
on
the
trend
of
companies
backing
out
of
paying
workers
meanwhile
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
who
has
deep
ties
to
coal
industry
executives
has
been
under
pressure
to
side
with
the
protesting
miners
some
of
whom
have
questioned
his
commitment
to
helping
them
on
thursday
mcconnell
called
blackjewel's
treatment
of
its
workers
shameful
and
outrageous
establishing
his
stance
these
miners
need
to
be
paid
in
full
for
their
work
the
kentucky
republican
said
in
a
statement
although
he
did
not
indicate
what
measures
he
might
take
to
assist
that
process
some
activists
argue
that
coal's
decline
underscores
the
need
for
worker
protections
in
any
proposed
climate
action
that
might
pass
the
federal
government
many
have
called
for
a
just
transition
one
that
would
see
communities
reliant
on
fossil
fuels
protected
as
the
industry
collapses
proponents
of
the
green
new
deal
a
proposal
to
rapidly
zero-out
emissions
across
the
united
states
pointed
to
the
kentucky
miner
protest
to
underpin
their
argument
the
coal
mining
industry
isn't
sustainable
wrote
the
youth-led
sunrise
movement
on
twitter
this
week
but
when
these
companies
go
under
the
workers
just
trying
to
put
food
on
the
table
don't
deserve
to
suffer
the
consequences
sunrise
which
supports
the
green
new
deal
went
on
to
argue
that
the
proposal
would
provide
the
safe
sustainable
green
jobs
our
workers
deserve
and
shared
a
link
to
a
fundraiser
for
the
miners
unions
and
labor
groups
have
taken
varying
stances
on
the
green
new
deal
with
some
supporting
its
emphasis
on
worker
protections
and
others
arguing
that
it
is
too
vague
and
could
harm
groups
like
coal
miners
but
clean
energy
advocates
say
that
protecting
impacted
workers
will
remain
a
top
priority
these
miners
deserve
what
they
are
owed
said
price
and
every
worker
with
a
job
that
depends
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
deserves
access
to
pensions
healthcare
and
good-paying
family-sustaining
careers
as
we
transition
to
the
clean
energy
economy
