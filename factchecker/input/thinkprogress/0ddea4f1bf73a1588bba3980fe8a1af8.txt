how
to
turn
the
tables
on
a
scam
phone
caller
phone
users
report
millions
of
dollars
in
losses
each
year
i
try
to
answer
the
buzz
of
my
cell
phone
even
if
i
don't
immediately
recognize
the
caller's
number
and
like
a
lot
of
people
i
receive
an
inordinate
number
sometimes
multiple
in
a
single
day
of
spammy
cold
calls
from
fraudsters
trying
to
trick
me
into
parting
with
my
money
usually
i
curse
my
misfortune
and
hang
up
on
them
but
sometimes
i
employ
a
different
tactic
and
engage
them
in
conversation
or
argument
here
to
my
best
recollection
is
how
one
recent
late-morning
call
went
down
caller
hello
i'm
calling
from
the
social
security
administration
we've
sent
you
several
letters
which
you've
failed
to
answer
and
so
i'm
calling
to
let
you
know
that
there's
been
suspicious
activity
on
your
account
and
you
need
to
take
immediate
action
me
excuse
me
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
caller
i'm
from
the
social
security
administration
you
need
to
take
immediate
action
otherwise
you
may
be
arrested
for
fraud
me
i'm

the
social
security
administration
caller

me
i'm
from
the
u.s.
social
security
administration
what
makes
you
say
that
i'm
not
me
no
you're
not
from
the
social
security
administration
i
know
better
than
that
because
the
social
security
administration
doesn't
call
people
up
out
of
the
blue
like
this
caller
yes
we
do
i'm
from
the
social
security
administration

will
be
arrested
and
put
in
jail
we
will
send
the
police
to
come
to
your
house
and
arrest
you
for
fraud
and
nonpayment
of
taxes
and
me
wait
a
minute

you're
not
from
the
government
and
you
know
that
i
know
you're
not
from
social
security
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
you
got
my
phone
number
caller
the
government
has
all
phone
numbers
we
have
your
driver's
license
and
other
information
about
you
you're
putting
yourself
at
great
risk
i've
already
said
that
we
sent
you
letters
which
you
didn't
answer
me
oh
yeah
you
did
say
that
what
address
did
you
send
the
letters
to
caller
pauses
uh
um
i
have
it
here
hangs
up
typically
the
back-and-forth
with
spammers
doesn't
go
as
far
as
this
one
after
all
time
is
money
to
the
vultures
lurking
in
a
sweatshop
somewhere
dialing
for
dollars
to
pick
off
unsuspecting
prey
unfortunately
there
are
a
lot
of
people
being
filched
by
these
unscrupulous
scammers
according
to
officials
with
the
federal
trade
commission
who
track
and
prosecute
telephone
fraud
figures
posted
on
the
ftc
website
show
that
people
filed
over
reports
about
social
security
imposters
in
the
months
ending
last
april
accounting
for
reported
losses
of
million
about
reports
and
million
in
reported
losses
were
in
the
previous
two
months
alone
the
ftc
said
the
phone
companies
are
also
alarmed
by
the
scammers
some
of
the
nation's
largest
mobile
and
broadband
communications
firms
announced
an
agreement
on
thursday
to
embrace
a
shared
standard
for
call-blocking
technology
in
a
coordinated
effort
to
stanch
the
flood
of
telephonic
spam
and
robocalls
in
an
agreement
with
state
attorneys
general
a
dozen
companies
said
they
would
voluntarily
implement
the
use
of
industry-approved
screening
devices
to
block
fraudulent
callers
before
they
reach
consumers
phones
and
would
assist
law
enforcement
in
identifying
unscrupulous
scammers
according
to
the
new
york
times
t-mobile
was
the
first
of
the
big
companies
to
install
the
technology
adding
the
program
in
january
to
some
of
its
phones
the
newspaper
said
verizon
has
also
started
its
own
call
authentication
program
and
that
at
t
is
cooperating
with
t-mobile
and
comcast
to
to
screen
out
spam
calls
across
their
networks
the
telephone
firms
that
signed
the
agreement
include
bandwidth
centurylink
charter
communications
consolidated
communications
frontier
communications
u.s.
cellular
and
windstream
services
this
is
welcome
news
and
may
lead
to
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
spam
calls
that
all
of
us
get
for
sure
it
won't
eliminate
the
problem
because
scammers
are
tenacious
and
indiscriminate
offenders
they
aren't
likely
to
give
up
easily
they
are
hell-bent
on
targeting
all
age
groups
incomes
and
demographic
segments
of
the
population
and
they
do
so
at
shockingly
similar
rates
of
the
people
who
reported
interactions
with
social
security
scammers
just
of
them
actually
lost
money
but
when
the
scammers
make
a
hit
they
tend
to
score
big
the
median
individual
reported
loss
was
which
is
about
four
times
higher
than
the
median
individual
loss
for
all
fraud
tracked
by
the
ftc
will
maxson
assistant
director
in
the
ftc's
division
of
marketing
practices
told
me
that
the
social
security
telephone
routine
has
recently
replaced
a
similar
scam
that
had
callers
pretending
to
be
with
the
internal
revenue
service
from
october
to
september
about
reports
of
irs
imposter
scams
were
filed
with
the
ftc
collectively
indicating
million
in
consumer
losses
it's
certainly
possible
that
those
scammers
that
were
using
the
irs
scam
tactics
have
migrated
to
the
social
security
scam
he
said
noting
that
many
of
the
calls
originate
overseas
most
often
from
india
sometimes
there's
not
a
human
on
the
call
instead
a
robotic
voice
intones
a
warning
to
call
the
government
to
clear
their
records
provide
personal
information
or
purchase
a
product
to
resolve
a
dispute
with
the
social
security
administration
or
some
other
government
agency
here's
a
sample
of
such
a
call
ssa
robocall
mp
maxson
pointed
me
to
the
set
of
tips
that
the
ftc
uses
to
encourage
people
to
guard
against
scammers
and
robot
callers
pretending
to
be
government
officials
ftc
officials
don't
encourage
citizen
engagement
with
people
posing
as
government
officials
as
i
did
with
the
spammer
who
called
me
doing
that
wouldn't
accomplish
anything
mitch
katz
another
spokesman
at
the
ftc
told
me
it
might
even
encourage
them
to
call
back
because
he'll
know
he
has
a
live
person
with
a
real
phone
number
katz
said
the
better
course
of
action
is
to
jot
down
the
number
on
your
caller
id
and
report
it
to
the
ftc
we
have
ways
of
tracking
them
down
he
said
ah
yes
that's
wise
advice
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
enjoyed
arguing
with
that
social
security
imposter
i
felt
as
if
i'd
effectively
turned
the
tables
on
him
and
wasted
his
time
better
yet
i'd
like
to
think
that
i
stalled
him
long
enough
to
spare
some
other
unfortunate
mark
from
having
to
confront
his
shady
enterprise
this
story
has
been
updated
to
correct
the
spelling
of
will

last
name
