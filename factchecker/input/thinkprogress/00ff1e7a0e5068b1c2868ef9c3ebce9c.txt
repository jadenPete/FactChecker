major
climate
report
emphasizes
collective
and
individual
action
necessary
to
avert
crisis
impact
of
food
production
and
consumption
is
the
main
theme
of
the
u.n.
ipcc's
new
report
a
much-anticipated
international
climate
report
summary
out
thursday
carries
a
critical
warning
for
people
and
corporations
alike
both
individual
and
collective
action
will
be
required
in
order
to
stave
off
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change
the
sweeping
report
from
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
focuses
on
land
use
with
an
emphasis
on
farming
forestry
and
agriculture
examining
the
link
between
land
use
and
global
warming
the
report
finds
the
world
on
a
collision
course
as
the
need
for
zeroing-out
emissions
grows
more
critical
for
addressing
climate
change
food
security
and
land
degradation
are
also
emerging
as
a
major
problem
one
exacerbated
by
global
warming
along
with
forestry
and
other
land
uses
agriculture
accounts
for
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
report
states
cattle
and
rice
fields
alone
are
responsible
for
roughly
half
of
all
methane
emissions
and
agricultural
practices
have
largely
contributed
to
soil
degradation
furthering
global
food
insecurity
meanwhile
the
report
states
that
between
and
of
all
food
goes
to
waste
spurring
greater
emissions
for
example
due
to
methane
released
from
landfills
while
reducing
emissions
associated
with
fossil
fuels
is
key
to
mitigating
the
impacts
of
climate
change
the
new
report
homes
in
on
changes
big
and
small
from
personal
habits
to
systemic
shifts
that
will
be
necessary
to
truly
address
climate
change
that
means
an
overhaul
of
forestry
and
agriculture
but
it
also
means
shifting
human
diets
and
expectations
the
recommendations
come
at
a
time
when
some
u.s.
lawmakers
including
several
democratic
presidential
contenders
are
looking
to
overhaul
national
farming
practices
with
an
eye
toward
climate
action
something
very
new
in
the
report
really
was
to
take
a
look
at
the
food
system
as
a
whole
from
the
production
side
from
the
supply
chain
side
cynthia
rosenzweig
a
nasa
senior
research
scientist
and
ipcc
lead
author
said
in
a
statement
how
does
the
food
get
to
people
and
what
kind
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
are
associated
with
transport
and
packaging
and
retail
and
storage
all
of
those
also
provide
opportunities
for
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
among
the
necessary
changes
recommended
in
the
report
is
producing
more
food
on
less
land
doing
so
more
sustainably
and
both
wasting
less
food
and
changing
what
people
eat
while
the
ipcc
does
not
directly
instruct
a
full
shift
to
vegan
and
vegetarian
diets
the
report
is
relatively
blunt
about
the
need
for
a
decrease
in
meat
consumption
and
an
embrace
of
more
plant-based
diets
those
diets
are
less
resource-intensive
and
associated
with
fewer
greenhouse
gas
emissions
climate
advocates
have
long
disagreed
over
the
role
to
which
individual
action
can
help
to
combat
global
warming
with
collective
change
from
fossil
fuel
companies
for
example
often
cited
as
a
more
important
effort
but
the
ipcc
report
indicates
that
both
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
combat
the
climate
crisis
in
a
statement
pamela
mcelwee
an
ipcc
lead
author
and
ecology
professor
at
rutgers
university
argued
the
upside
of
such
conclusions
one
of
the
important
findings
of
our
work
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
actions
that
we
can
take
now
she
said
they're
available
to
us
now
but
serious
hurdles
remain
for
example
as
bioenergy
sources
like
ethanol
become
more
critical
they
can
cause
further
land
degradation
as
they
take
up
space
and
water
resources
while
infringing
on
biodiversity
planting
more
trees
meanwhile
is
likely
a
necessity
to
absorb
carbon
but
that
practice
can
worsen
livestock
and
crop
issues
in
a
first
for
the
ipcc
the
report
recommends
looking
to
indigenous
communities
for
ways
to
surmount
those
looming
challenges
agricultural
practices
that
include
indigenous
and
local
knowledge
can
contribute
to
overcoming
the
combined
challenges
of
climate
change
food
security
biodiversity
conservation
and
combating
desertification
and
land
degradation
the

the
report's
author
team
consists
of
experts
from
countries
with
dozens
of
contributing
authors
assisting
on
a
chapter-by-chapter
basis
more
than
half
of
the
authors
are
from
developing
countries
a
first
for
the
ipcc
the
land
report
will
be
followed
by
a
second
report
in
september
that
looks
at
climate
change
and
oceans
along
with
the
cryosphere
water

like

thursday's
release
follows
last
year's
landmark
report
from
the
ipcc
which
estimated
that
the
world
had
approximately
years
left
before
crossing
a
critical
threshold
of
global
warming
one
that
would
yield
climate
impacts
on
a
scale
not
yet
seen
with
years
now
left
the
new
report
looks
more
closely
at
a
likely
coming
food
crisis
and
the
role
of
land
use
as
both
perpetrator
and
savior
land
is
where
we
live
land
is
undergoing
human
pressure
and
is
part
of
the
solution
but
land
can
not
do
it
all
ipcc
housing
chair
hoesung
lee
said
in
a
thursday
morning
press
conference
climate
impacts
are
already
taking
a
severe
toll
on
land
with
heat
waves
and
droughts
undermining
food
security
along
with
human
health
and
the
environment
the
ipcc's
latest
report
explains
if
the
earth
passes
degrees
celsius
above
preindustrial
temperatures
wildfires
will
also
become
an
even
bigger
threat
and
if
the
world
passes
degrees
celsius
of
warming
the
upper
threshold
established
in
the
paris
climate
agreement
a
food
crisis
becomes
highly
likely
the
report
warns
with
developing
countries
most
likely
to
suffer
the
land
report
also
singles
out
several
other
key
areas
of
concern
including
deforestation
particularly
in
tropical
rainforests
the
amazon
is
one
of
the
world's
major
carbon
sinks
playing
a
critical
role
in
undercutting
rising
temperatures
but
brazilian
president
jair
bolsonaro
has
opened
up
the
amazon
to
major
deforestation
efforts
sparking
alarm
from
experts
desertification
also
poses
a
serious
threat
with
half
a
billion
people
already
living
in
areas
that
are
turning
into
desert
and
soil
being
lost
as
much
as
times
as
fast
as
it
is
gained
the
ipcc's
findings
echo
a
major
report
released
in
july
by
the
world
resources
institute
wri
and
other
international
organizations
that
analysis
probed
how
to
feed
billion
people
by
mid-century
while
using
significantly
less
land
reducing
emissions
and
accounting
for
equitable
food
and
nutrition
access
like
the
ipcc
that
report
concluded
that
people
would
need
to
embrace
plant-based
diets
and
shift
away
from
meat
while
also
potentially
embracing
crop
modification
through
technology
like
crispr
which
can
be
used
to
edit
genomes
the
ipcc's
findings
lend
weight
to
lawmakers
backing
dramatic
climate
action
like
the
green
new
deal
resolution
an
ambitious
plan
introduced
in
february
by
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-ny
and
sen
ed
markey
d-ma
that
blueprint
for
rapidly
zeroing
out
emissions
across
the
united
states
has
drawn
fire
from
republicans
many
of
whom
argue
it
would
ban
meat
the
proposal
itself
does
not
call
for
such
steps
but
it
does
underscore
the
agricultural
changes
likely
necessary
for
net-zero
emissions
and
farming
has
already
found
its
way
into
the
race
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
on
wednesday
released
a
new
farm
economy
plan
one
that
would
seek
to
empower
small
farmers
over
agribusinesses
while
encouraging
climate-friendly
practices
t
he
agriculture
sector
has
become
one
of
the
largest
polluters
in
our
economy
warren
argues
in
her
proposal
warren
isn't
alone
sens
kirsten
gillibrand
d-ny
and
amy
klobuchar
d-mn
have
also
released
agriculture
plans
with
environmental
angles
and
sen
cory
booker
d-nj
on
thursday
released
his
own
senate
plan
for
a
nature-based
strategy
that
would
put
billions
of
dollars
into
encouraging
ranchers
and
farmers
to
reduce
emissions
through
green
practices
