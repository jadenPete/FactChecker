trump
reveals
he
has
no
idea
how
the
diversity
visa
lottery
works
getting
a
green
card
isn't
as
easy
as
having
your
name
pulled
from
a
hat
at
a
campaign
rally
in
cincinnati
ohio
thursday
night
president
donald
trump
painted
a
wildly
inaccurate
picture
to
his
supporters
of
how
the
diversity
visa
lottery
program
works
the
diversity
visa
lottery
program
awards
roughly
green
cards
each
year
to
citizens
from
various
underrepresented
countries
to
legally
live
and
work
in
the
united
states
in
turn
lottery
recipients
diversify
the
u.s.
population
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
lottery
an
individual
must
meet
a
number
of
merit-based
factors
including
a
certain
level
of
education
or
comparable
work
experience
in
trump's
mind
however
the
diversity
visa
lottery
functions
as
some
kind
of
powerball
for
criminals
and
you
pick
people
out
of
the
lottery
trump
said
thursday
night
gesturing
as
if
he
were
picking
names
out
of
a
hat
well
let's
see
this
one
is
a
murderer
this
one
robbed
four
banks
this
one
i
better
not
say
this
one
another
murderer
ladies
and
gentlemen
another
murderer
he
added
do
you
think
countries
are
going
to
put
their
great
citizens
into
the
lottery
look
at
the
people
they
put
into
these
lotteries
because
the
diversity
visa
lottery
is
self-selecting
it
is
not
up
to
individual
countries
as
trump
appears
to
believe
to
decide
which
of
its
citizens
can
be
considered
for
a
green
card
in
addition
to
the
education
requirements
all
recipients
of
the
visa
undergo
background
checks
health
examinations
security
screenings
and
interviews
by
consular
officers
before
their
arrival
in
the
united
states
trump
has
frequently
railed
against
the
diversity
visa
lottery
program
even
threatening
to
eliminate
the
program
altogether
in
after
a
lottery
recipient
from
uzbekistan
carried
out
an
extremist
attack
in
new
york
city
killing
eight
people
the
terrorist
came
into
our
country
through
what
is
called
the
diversity
visa
lottery
program
a
chuck
schumer
beauty
i
want
merit
based
trump
tweeted
in
november
we
are
fighting
hard
for
merit
based
immigration
no
more
democrat
lottery
systems
we
must
get
much
tougher
and
smarter
but
the
irony
is
the
diversity
visa
lottery
is
already
merit-based
and
its
education
and
work
requirements
are
exactly
what
trump
says
he
wants
more
of
in
the
u.s.
immigration
system
getting
a
green
card
through
the
diversity
visa
lottery
program
is
no
walk
in
the
park
lottery
is
a
misnomer
this
phrase
came
into
effect
because
there
is
no
backlog
anu
joshi
immigration
policy
director
for
the
new
york
immigration
coalition
told
thinkprogress
it's
not
really
a
lottery
at
all
it's
a
very
intensive
program
very
few
people
actually
make
it
through
the
majority
of
applicants
million
usually
apply
are
eliminated
because
their
home
countries
have
used
up
the
slots
allotted
them
over
a
span
of
five
years
meaning
people
from
countries
india
china
and
mexico
are
usually
excluded
eastern
european
and
african
nations
are
among
those
most
likely
to
benefit
from
the
program
along
with
a
number
of
smaller
asian
countries
this
year
egypt
and
russia
topped
the
list
of
lottery
recipients
