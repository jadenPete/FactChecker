fbi
warns
that
conspiracy
theories
like
qanon
pose
a
domestic
terror
threat
it's
first
time
the
feds
have
waded
into
the
swamp
of
the
pro-trump
conspiracy
theory
for
the
first
time
an
fbi
intelligence
bulletin
has
assessed
that
fringe
internet-based
conspiracy
theories
pose
a
domestic
terror
threat
that
encourage
the
targeting
of
specific
people
places
and
organizations
thereby
increasing
the
risk
of
extremist
violence
against
such
targets
the
intelligence
bulletin
was
written
by
the
fbi's
phoenix
field
office
and
released
in
may
but
was
first
reported
by
yahoo
news
on
thursday
it
specifically
mentions
pizzagate
the
conspiracy
that
the
clintons
and
other
elite
democrats
were
indulging
in
child
sacrifice
at
a
d.c.
pizzeria
as
well
as
a
host
of
other
terms
common
on
fringe
far-right
internet
ecosystems
like
false
flags
zionist
occupied
government
and
of
course
qanon
for
those
lucky
enough
to
not
spend
their
days
following
the
latest
qanon
news
a
brief
primer
qanon
is
the
theory
that
president
donald
trump
along
with
attorney
general
william
barr
the
u.s.
military
and
a
shadowy
insider
known
only
as
q
are
all
secretly
working
to
take
down
a
deep
state
cabal
made
up
primarily
of
democrats
who
are
controlling
the
world
and
also
like
to
traffic
and
or
eat
children
supposed
promises
by
q
posted
first
on
fringe
sites
like
chan
and
chan
keep
failing
to
come
to
fruition
but
that
has
done
little
to
dampen
the
popularity
of
the
conspiracy
both
online
and
off
qanon
supporters
make
frequent
appearances
at
trump
rallies
and
the
president
keeps
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
by
re-tweeting
qanon
accounts
on
twitter
and
thereby
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
q
adherents
validating
the
theory
while
it's
easy
to
laugh
at
qanon
and
other
fringe
conspiracies
have
motivated
some
very
real-world
violence
as
the
fbi
memo
notes
in
december
a
man
entered
comet
ping
pong
in
washington
dc
the
restaurant
supposedly
at
the
center
of
pizzagate
with
an
ar-
rifle
firing
a
shot
and
pointing
his
rifle
at
an
employee
the
man
was
later
arrested
and
pleaded
guilty
to
federal
weapons
charges
in
march
in
june
a
qanon
supporter
in
an
armored
truck
blocked
the
hoover
dam
bypass
armed
with
several
firearms
and
magazines
of
ammunition
after
a
minute
standoff
with
police
he
fled
to
arizona
where
he
was
arrested
he
has
since
been
charged
with
terrorism
as
well
as
aggravated
assault
unlawful
flight
and
weapons
offenses
as
thinkprogress
reported
last
year
a
qanon-affiliated
group
also
harassed
police
officers
and
civic
leaders
in
arizona
over
claims
that
the
deep
state
was
operating
a
child
sex
camp
in
the
desert
there
a
qanon
believer
is
also
believed
to
have
used
the
conspiracy
as
inspiration
to
gun
down
alleged
new
york
crime
boss
francesco
cali
in
march
travis
view
a
qanon
researcher
who
also
co-hosts
the
qanon
anonymous
podcast
said
he
was
relieved
by
the
memo
as
it
showed
that
the
feds
understood
the
real
dangers
that
qanon
poses
it
was
an
unknown
beforehand
whether
the
fbi
or
law
enforcement
was
taking
qanon
and
other
conspiracy-driven
extremist
movements
seriously
at
all
view
told
thinkprogress
this
is
the
first
confirmation
that
the
feds
are
very
aware
of
qanon
and
the
threat
they
pose
view
described
qanon
as
very
much
like
a
decentralized
cult
they
get
separated
from
their
families
and
get
taken
down
this
rabbit
hole
to
super
delusional
beliefs
that
cause
them
to
do
violence
and
violent
things
most
qanon
followers
are
harmless
they're
just
shacked
up
in
their
room
but
a
few
of
them
get
so
delusional
that
they
act
out
in
the
real
world
the
fbi's
memo
also
specifically
mentions
how
the
internet
has
allowed
these
theories
to
thrive
the
advent
of
the
internet
and
social
media
has
enabled
promoters
of
conspiracy
theories
to
produce
and
share
greater
volumes
of
material
via
online
platforms
that
larger
audiences
of
consumers
can
quickly
and
easily
access
the
report
reads
based
on
the
increase
volumed
and
reach
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
more
extremist-minded
individuals
will
be
exposed
to
potentially
harmful
conspiracy
theories
accept
ones
that
are
favorable
to
their
views
and
possibly
carry
out
criminal
or
violent
actions
as
a
result
to
be
clear
qanon
is
not
a
movement
that
explicitly
encourages
members
to
engage
in
acts
of
violence
a
large
percentage
of
q-related
content
simply
encourages
followers
to
enjoy
the
show
that
is
always
just
about
to
begin
however
as
proven
by
recent
mass
attacks
in
new
zealand
pittsburgh
and
california
to
name
just
a
few
it
only
takes
one
self-radicalized
individual
to
carry
out
a
major
terror
attack
especially
at
a
time
of
heightened
political
polarization
a
point
that
both
view
and
the
fbi
made
because
some
conspiracy
theories
are
highly
partisan
in
nature
political
developments
including
those
surrounding
major
election
cycles
such
as
the
presidential
election
likely
will
impact
the
direction
of
these
conspiracy
theories
and
the
potential
activities
of
extremists
who
subscribe
to
them
the
report
reads
my
most
important
takeaway
from
the
memo
is
that
this
isn't
a
fading
threat
view
said
it
is
a
growing
threat
as
the
political
season
and
rhetoric
gets
more
heated
conspiracy
theories
get
an
over-sized
importance
in
people's
lives
it's
certainly
something
to
watch
out
for
the
fbi
assessment
concludes
it
is
very
likely
that
in
the
future
domestic
extremists
will
be
motivated
whether
wholly
or
in
part
by
anti-government
identity
based
and
fringe
political
conspiracy
theories
and
as
for
qanon
despite
its
continual
failure
to
deliver
on
its
promises
view
predicts
it
won't
be
going
anywhere
any
time
soon
the
fbi
assessment
he
noted
was
already
being
explained
away
by
qanon
followers
as
more
evidence
of
the
deep
state
or
something
planted
as
a
way
to
move
the
media
to
ask
trump
about
q
a
long-held
ambition
of
qanon
followers
the
clinton
body-count
conspiracy
theory
which
claims
multiple
people
close
to
the
clintons
have
died
under
mysterious
circumstances
suggesting
the
clintons
have
something
to
do
with
it
was
created
in
early
s
and
it
trended
last
week
on
twitter
so
these
sort
of
conspiracy
theories
when
they
catch
on
and
resonate
with
a
community
they
don't
go
away
view
said
he
added
i
have
no
idea
when
they
might
give
up
the
game
but
if
i
were
to
speculate
based
on
psychological
research
into
conspiracy
theories
and
followers
this
is
something
with
us
for
at
least
a
generation
