kristen
stewart's
experience
is
emblematic
of
lgbtq
people's
struggles
in
hollywood
i
have
fully
been
told
if
you
just
like
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
go
out
holding
your
girlfriend's
hand
in
public
she
said
in
an
interview
with
harper's
bazaar
uk
actor
kristen
stewart
who
has
been
romantically
linked
to
model
stella
maxwell
since
said
i
have
fully
been
told
if
you
just
like
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
go
out
holding
your
girlfriend's
hand
in
public
you
might
get
a
marvel
movie
i
don't
want
to
work
with
people
like
that
stewart
has
said
publicly
she
does
not
identify
as
bisexual
or
lesbian
and
doesn't
want
to
choose
a
label
for
her
sexuality
in
the
same
interview
she
added
i
was
informed
by
an
old
school
mentality
which
is
you
want
to
preserve
your
career
and
your
success
and
your
productivity
and
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
don't
like
you
and
they
don't
like
that
you
date
girls
and
they
don't
like
that
you
don't
identify
as
a
quote
unquote
lesbian
but
you
also
don't
identify
as
a
quote
unquote
heterosexual
and
people
like
to
know
stuff
so
what
the
fuck
are
you
although
it
may
at
times
appear
as
though
lgbtq
representation
and
participation
in
hollywood
has
achieved
some
semblance
of
parity
stewart's
experience
is
far
from
unique
several
young
openly
lgbtq
actors
such
as
ellen
page
and
ezra
miller
have
talked
about
how
their
gender
and
sexuality
have
affected
how
people
talk
to
them
about
their
careers
ellen
page
star
of
inception
juno
and
tallulah
came
out
as
gay
in
i
was
distinctly
told
by
people
in
the
industry
when
i
started
to
become
known
people
cannot
know
you're
gay
she
said
to
porter
edit
earlier
this
year
and
i
was
pressured
forced
in
many
cases
to
always
wear
dresses
and
heels
for
events
and
photo
shoots
as
if
lesbians
don't
wear
dresses
and
heels
but
i
will
never
let
anyone
put
me
in
anything
i
feel
uncomfortable
in
ever
again
ezra
miller
who
has
starred
in
justice
league
madame
bovary
and
the
most
recent
harry
potter
franchise
fantastic
beasts
came
out
as
queer
in
to
out
and
told
gq
in
that
their
gender
is
fluid
i'm
comfortable
with
all
the
pronouns
i
let
he
his
him
ride
and
that's
fine
miller
said
but
miller
said
they
were
told
not
to
be
open
about
their
sexuality
and
gender
by
a
number
of
people
who
thought
it
would
damage
their
acting
career
in
miller
said
i
won't
specify
who
told
me
not
to
come
out
folks
in
the
industry
folks
outside
the
industry
people
i've
never
spoken
to
they
said
there's
a
reason
so
many
gay
queer
gender-fluid
people
in
hollywood
conceal
their
sexual
identity
or
their
gender
identity
in
their
public
image
i
was
told
i
had
done
a
silly
thing
in
thwarting
my
own
potential
to
be
a
leading
man
sarah
paulson
who
also
chooses
not
to
label
her
sexual
identity
told
porter
edit
in
said
that
she
was
told
that
her
relationship
with
holland
taylor
could
be
a
liability
for
her
career
early
on
when
people
found
out
i
was
with
holland
some
said
i
think
you
have
to
be
careful
i'm
afraid
it's
going
to
affect
your
career
negatively
the
ocean's
actor
said
one
of
the
most
notorious
examples
of
hollywood
reacting
negatively
to
an
actor's
sexuality
was
rupert
everett
star
of
my
best
friend's
wedding
and
a
midsummer
night's
dream
who
said
that
he
stopped
getting
offers
for
roles
in
he
has
since
focused
on
writing
scripts
and
roles
that
he
could
play
such
as
poet
and
playwright
oscar
wilde
he
said
in
to
bbc's
radio
that
hollywood
is
an
extremely
conservative
world
that
pretends
to
be
a
liberal
world
although
lgbtq
character
diversity
in
films
is
increasing
in
some
respects
hollywood
has
a
lot
of
progress
to
make
on
lgbtq
inclusion
according
to
glaad's
studio
responsibility
index
lgbtq
characters
had
more
screen
time
than
in
previous
years
of
the
lgbtq-inclusive
films
released
last
year
featured
more
than
minutes
of
screen-time
for
an
lgbtq
character
when
looking
at
each
of
the
lgbtq
characters
glaad
counted
had
less
than
three
minutes
of
screen
time
and
had
less
than
one
minute
of
screen
time
transgender
characters
were
absent
from
the
major
studio
releases
for
the
second
year
in
a
row
and
there
is
often
tremendous
buzz
around
movies
supposed
lgbtq
representation
only
to
ultimately
fail
to
deliver
anything
meaningful
in
terms
of
screen
time
or
actual
representation
of
a
queer
relationship
often
there
is
only
a
hint
of
a
relationship
or
a
wink
and
a
nod
rather
than
representation
in
line
with
relationships
between
straight
people
beauty
and
the
beast's
live
action
remake
was
applauded
for
featuring
a
gay
lefou
but
he
was
only
very
briefly
shown
dancing
with
a
man
in
drag
during
a
ballroom
scene
largely
for
comedic
effect
finding
dory
briefly
showed
two
women
together
in
a
park
which
some
audience
members
interpreted
as
a
lesbian
couple
and
others
didn't
and
they
were
only
shown
in
a
speechless
reaction
shot
when
questioned
about
the
women
the
movie's
co-director
andrew
stanton
said
they
can
be
whatever
you
want
them
to
be
there's
no
right
or
wrong
answer
most
recently
marvel's
avengers
endgame
tossed
in
a
quick
throwaway
line
alluding
to
a
gay
relationship
a
scene
disney
pumped
up
as
the
first
openly
gay
character
in
the
largest
box
office
franchise
in
cinematic
history
some
lgbtq
viewers
were
upset
with
the
representation
of
harry
potter
character
albus
dumblemore
in
fantastic
beasts
crimes
of
grindelwald
who
j.k.
rowling
said
had
a
relationship
of
a
sexual
dimension
with
gellert
grindelwald
but
when
it
came
time
to
show
that
relationship
onscreen
and
address
dumbledore's
sexuality
in
general
the
director
david
yates
said
those
things
would
not
be
explicit
in
the
film
similarly
in
thor
ragnarok
the
character
valkyrie
portrayed
by
out
actress
tessa
thompson
had
a
scene
which
made
her
sexuality
explicit
but
was
ultimately
cut
from
the
film
some
of
that
representation
may
improve
soon
however
in
thor
love
and
thunder
the
next
sequel
in
the
same
franchise
valkyrie
will
reportedly
get
more
explicit
representation
of
a
relationship
with
a
woman
according
to
i
marvel
studios
confirmed
a
romantic
storyline
of
valkyrie
seeking
a
new
queen
