former
israeli
ambassador
says
trump
administration
encouraged
ban
on
omar
tlaib
the
white
house
claims
reports
of
trump's
involvement
are
inaccurate
the
nation
of
israel
has
officially
banned
muslim
reps
ilhan
omar
d-mn
and
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
from
entering
the
country
according
to
israel's
former
ambassador
to
the
united
states
the
unprecedented
denial
of
entry
was
apparently
president
donald
trump's
idea
thursday
morning
trump
tweeted
his
support
for
blocking
the
lawmakers
from
visiting
israel
claiming
that
because
they
hate
israel
all
jewish
people
it
would
show
great
weakness
on
israel's
part
to
allow
them
to
visit
he
added
that
omar
and
tlaib
are
a
disgrace
later
in
the
morning
the
white
house
tried
to
downplay
its
involvement
in
the
decision
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
said
in
a
statement
that
the
israeli
government
can
do
what
it
wants
but
claimed
reports
that
trump
had
urged
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
to
make
the
decision
were
inaccurate
shortly
thereafter
israel's
former
ambassador
to
the
united
states
danny
ayalon
seemed
to
contradict
that
claim
suggesting
in
a
tweet
that
the
ban
very
much
came
at
the
recommendation
of
the
u.s.
administration
when
the
two
racist
anti-semitic
members
of
congress
refused
to
visit
israel
with
steny
hoyer
whose
delegation
heard
from
wide-ranging
israeli
palestinian
leaders
on
all
sides
of
the
spectrum
it
became
clear
their
intention
isn't
just
to
visit
but
to
cause
provocations
ayalon
tweeted
israel
like
every
sovereign
country
has
the
right
to
decide
who
can
enter
and
who
cannot
enter
who
must
stay
and
who
must
leave
the
us
administration
recommended
accordingly
and
the
israeli
government
rightfully
decided
to
accept
that
recommendation
according
to
netanyahu
israel
is
barring
omar
and
tlaib
for
their
support
of
the
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
bds
movement
a
campaign
to
punish
israel
financially
for
its
occupation
of
palestine
and
its
mistreatment
of
palestinian
citizens
he
believes
that
their
plan
to
visit
shows
that
their
sole
purpose
is
to
harm
israel
and
increase
incitement
against
it
israeli
law
supports
denying
entry
to
supporters
of
the
bds
movement
but
the
current
israeli
ambassador
ron
dermer
said
just
last
month
that
this
would
not
apply
to
tlaib
and
omar
out
of
respect
for
the
u.s.
congress
what
is
conspicuous
about
the
application
of
this
criteria
is
that
omar
and
tlaib
are
not
the
only
members
of
congress
who
support
the
bds
movement
when
the
house
took
up
a
resolution
condemning
bds
last
month
they
were
two
of
lawmakers
who
voted
against
that
resolution
both
women
however
happen
to
be
muslim
several
weeks
ago
trump
repeatedly
attacked
tlaib
and
omar
along
with
two
other
congresswomen
of
color
telling
them
to
go
back
where
you
came
from
a
common
racist
trope
as
part
of
his
attacks
he
also
weaponized
accusations
of
anti-semitism
just
as
he
did
in
his
tweet
thursday
morning
