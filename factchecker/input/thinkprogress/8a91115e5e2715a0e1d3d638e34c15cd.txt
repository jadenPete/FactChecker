said
i

of
these

ought
to
be

rep
ralph
abraham
r-la
who
is
running
for
governor
in
the
elections
attended
a
meeting
of
a
right-wing
patriots
group
on
thursday
when
an
attendee
delivered
a
racist
rant
against
illegal
immigration
and
the
members
of
congress
who
allow
it
and
urged
that
some
be
shot
abraham
did
not
push
back
the
incident
happened
during
a
question
and
answer
session
at
the
acadiana
patriots
meeting
in
lafayette
louisiana
in
two
audio
recordings
posted
online
by
the
progressive
research
group
american
bridge
st
century
the
constituent
is
heard
comparing
the
modern
invasion
by
undocumented
immigrants
to
japanese
people
who
he
claimed
crossed
the
rio
grande
during
world
war
ii
this
congress
and
this
senate
too
are
absent
minded
and
irresponsible
the
person
claimed
i
think
some
of
these
people
whoever
they
are
ought
to
be
shot
it
is
unclear
whether
he
wanted
to
assassinate
the
lawmakers
or
the
immigrants
but
it
is
clear
that
abraham
did
nothing
to
challenge
the
call
to
violence
in
his
response
let
me
jump
in
here
the
third-term
republican
answered
many
of
those
apprehended
are
not
hispanic
they
are
chinese
pakistani
indian
he
observed
abraham
then
complained
that
a
bill
that
would
have
provided
billion
for
the
wall
failed
when
the
republicans
held
a
majority
in
the
last
congress
due
to
gop
defections
abraham's
congressional
and
campaign
press
offices
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
thinkprogress
inquiry
about
the
incident
abraham
tweeted
after
the
violent
white
nationalist
attacks
in
charlottesville
virginia
i
like
most
of
la
reject
violence
racism
let's
not
group
ppl
based
on
bad
actions
of
a
few
