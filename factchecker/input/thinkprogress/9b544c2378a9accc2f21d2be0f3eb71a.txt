as
climate
reckoning
arrives
over
agriculture
usda's
scientists
face
censorship
with
this
week's
ipcc
report
set
to
take
a
hard
line
on
agriculture
usda
could
see
heightened
scrutiny
a
government
climate
scientist
who
says
the
trump
administration
buried
a
groundbreaking
report
he
authored
has
left
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
usda
in
protest
over
the
political
views
top
officials
allegedly
imposed
on
his
work
politico
reported
monday
that
lewis
ziska
a
plant
physiologist
who
worked
at
usda's
agricultural
research
service
ars
for
more
than
years
quit
due
to
an
increasingly
political
atmosphere
at
the
agency
ziska
had
worked
on
a
major
rice
study
last
year
one
that
found
rising
levels
of
carbon
dioxide
could
imperil
the
critical
source
of
sustenance
for
some
million
people
globally
according
to
ziska's
work
the
mineral
and
protein
content
in
rice
along
with
key
vitamins
is
expected
to
drop
as
greenhouse
gas
levels
rise
agency
scientists
have
accused
department
officials
of
seeking
to
bury
that
report
among
others
in
keeping
with
president
donald
trump's
stance
denying
and
downplaying
climate
change
usda
secretary
sonny
perdue
has
similarly
dismissed
global
warming
as
weather
patterns
usda
claims
the
study
wasn't
publicized
because
of
disagreement
among
career
officials
but
ziska
told
politico
that
the
reason
the
study
was
buried
is
down
to
political
ideology
and
the
administration's
unwillingness
to
embrace
established
climate
science
there
was
a
sense
at
usda
that
if
the
science
agreed
with
the
politics
then
the
policymakers
would
consider
it
to
be
good
science
and
if
it
didn't
agree
with
the
politics
then
it
was
something
that
was
flawed
and
needed
to
be
done
again
he
said
the
scientist's
departure
coincides
with
a
summary
copy
of
a
highly-anticipated
u.n.
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
report
on
land
use
being
leaked
this
week
the
report
emphasizes
that
global
food
production
must
become
more
sustainable
in
order
to
mitigate
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change
his
resignation
also
comes
as
the
agency
is
still
reeling
from
a
controversial
relocation
effort
connected
to
disputes
over
scientific
integrity
the
department
is
set
to
lose
a
staggering
number
of
career
officials
over
a
deeply
contested
relocation
plan
perdue
announced
in
june
that
staffers
with
usda's
economic
research
service
ers
and
the
national
institute
of
food
and
agriculture
nifa
would
be
asked
to
relocate
to
kansas
city
which
straddles
kansas
and
missouri
over
staffers
were
given
until
july
to
decide
whether
to
relocate
by
september
more
than
half
of
those
staffers
reportedly
declined
to
move
and
have
effectively
chosen
to
resign
a
dramatic
loss
of
institutional
knowledge
and
career
staff
who
have
worked
with
the
department
for
decades
usda
has
argued
that
the
move
is
a
cost-saving
effort
to
bring
the
department
closer
to
farm
country
but
former
usda
officials
and
the
union
representing
employees
have
rejected
that
narrative
many
say
it
is
an
attempt
to
force
out
knowledgeable
researchers
and
scientists
as
well
as
a
retaliation
for
the
climate
science
work
produced
by
some
staffers
at
usda
conversations
about
the
link
between
agriculture
and
climate
change
however
are
only
set
to
escalate
last
year
an
ipcc
report
warned
that
the
world
had
only
years
left
before
crossing
a
dangerous
threshold
of
global
warming
one
that
would
yield
climate
impacts
on
a
scale
not
seen
before
a
leaked
copy
of
this
year's
report
focuses
on
land
use
and
the
role
of
agriculture
in
mitigating
climate
change
according
to
the
draft
which
is
currently
being
debated
in
geneva
before
its
release
later
this
week
cutting
carbon
emissions
from
sources
like
cars
and
power
plants
will
only
go
so
far
agriculture
forestry
and
other
land-use
practices
are
producing
roughly
a
quarter
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
report
says
with
cattle
and
rice
fields
in
particular
generating
around
of
methane
emissions
that
has
contributed
heavily
to
climate
impacts
the
draft
finds
with
the
situation
only
set
to
worsen
climate
change
exacerbates
land
degradation
through
increases
in
rainfall
intensity
flooding
drought
frequency
and
severity
heat
stress
wind
sea-level
rise
and
wave
action
the
document
states
in
addition
to
changing
how
people
use
land
the
ipcc
draft
underscores
that
switching
to
vegetarian
and
vegan
diets
may
be
a
critical
part
of
staving
off
the
worst
climate
impacts
that
refrain
may
sound
familiar
to
some
critics
of
the
proposed
green
new
deal
a
blueprint
for
radically
shifting
the
united
states
to
net-zero
emissions
have
argued
the
climate
plan
will
ban
cows
and
deprive
americans
of
hamburgers
the
proposal
itself
does
not
move
to
bar
bovines
from
the
country
but
it
does
single
out
agriculture
as
a
major
source
of
greenhouse
gases
and
a
sector
in
need
of
overhauling
if
the
united
states
is
to
zero-out
emissions
the
ipcc's
findings
are
therefore
likely
to
draw
more
attention
to
the
climate
science
realities
dogging
agriculture
high
profile
exits
at
usda
are
also
likely
to
fuel
scrutiny
of
the
trump
administration's
attitudes
towards
the
sector's
relationship
with
climate
science
and
other
major
exits
over
climate
change
are
also
driving
headlines
rod
schoonover
a
former
senior
analyst
in
the
bureau
of
intelligence
and
research
at
the
state
department
wrote
in
an
op-ed
last
week
that
the
white
house
had
blocked
the
release
of
his
report
on
climate
change
and
national
security
the
stated
reason
schoonover
said
was
that
the
scientific
foundation
of
the
analysis
did
not
comport
with
the
administration's
position
on
climate
change
