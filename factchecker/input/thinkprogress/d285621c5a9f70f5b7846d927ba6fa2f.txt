trump's
enthusiasm
for
universal
background
checks
was
halted
by
one
call
to
the
nra
the
president
was
reportedly
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
the
nra
not
so
much
earlier
this
month
president
donald
trump
was
reportedly
enthusiastic
at
least
momentarily
about
holding
a
rose
garden
ceremony
to
sign
a
gun-control
bill
that
included
expanding
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
he
was
so
thrilled
about
the
prospect
of
that
historic
act
in
fact
that
he
called
the
national
rifle
association's
wayne
lapierre
to
tell
him
about
it
assuring
him
that
he'd
give
the
organization
cover
from
any
backlash
it's
going
to
be
great
wayne
they
will
love
us
he
reportedly
said
referring
to
the
nra's
members
lapierre's
answer
was
short
no
that
phone
call
and
the
buzz
around
the
proposed
rose
garden
ceremony
within
the
white
house
was
detailed
in
a
new
report
tuesday
from
the
atlantic's
elaina
pott
who
spoke
to
a
former
senior
white
house
official
several
nra
officials
and
others
familiar
with
the
conversations
the
call
in
which
trump
got
the
no
on
expanded
background
checks
from
lapierre
took
place
august
just
days
after
the
deadly
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
and
less
than
two
weeks
after
another
shooting
in
gilroy
california
that
left
four
people
dead
the
report
jibes
with
what's
publicly
known
about
how
quickly
trump
himself
has
lowered
expectations
about
any
real
solutions
to
curb
gun
violence
two
days
after
that
first
call
he
tweeted
that
he
had
spoken
to
the
nra
which
is
currently
dealing
with
its
own
set
of
internal
problems
and
assured
them
that
their
very
strong
views
would
be
fully
represented
and
respected
by
this
week
trump
was
refusing
to
answer
any
questions
about
whether
he
supports
background
checks
returning
to
his
campaign
line
that
such
screenings
were
already
in
use
and
didn't
work
as
it
turns
out
trump
called
lapierre
back
tuesday
and
assured
him
that
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
any
previous
chatter
of
taking
executive
action
has
dissipated
his
new
solutions
instead
focus
on
increasing
funding
for
mental-health
care
and
increasing
prosecutions
of
gun
crime
through
federal
firearms
charges
neither
of
these
solutions
will
have
any
impact
on
gun
violence
most
people
with
mental
health
issues
are
not
violent
and
most
mass
shooters
are
not
mentally
ill
as
for
gun
crime
charges
trump's
justice
department
boasted
last
year
that
it
had
smashed
previous
records
on
gun
crime
and
violent
crime
prosecutions
but
that
enforcement
had
no
discernible
effect
on
the
number
of
mass
shootings
the
only
hope
now
is
that
when
congress
finally
returns
from
recess
in
mid-september
lawmakers
use
any
remaining
momentum
to
actually
create
some
kind
of
change
through
gun
legislation
that
can
shift
trump's
peripatetic
mind
and
obedience
to
the
nra
polls
suggest
however
that
it
is
only
shootings
themselves
that
ignite
public
passions
enough
to
create
the
political
pressure
necessary
for
progress
