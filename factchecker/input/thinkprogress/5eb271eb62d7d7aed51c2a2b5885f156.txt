trump
boasts
about
log
cabin
republican
endorsement
as
its
members
flee
in
protest
trump
thinks
gay
republican
support
excuses
his
anti-lgbtq
policies
during
a
press
gaggle
tuesday
president
donald
trump
took
a
question
from
the
washington
blade's
chris
johnson
who
has
long
been
a
member
of
the
white
house
press
pool
though
rarely
called
upon
johnson
asked
if
trump
was
okay
with
the
way
his
administration
has
made
it
easier
to
discriminate
against
lgbtq
workers
trump
ignored
the
question
and
instead
boasted
that
gay
republicans
seemed
to
like
him
well
you
know
i
just
got
an
award
and
an
endorsement
yesterday
from
the
exact
group
you
saw
that
trump
said
referring
to
the
log
cabin
republican
endorsement
that
was
in
fact
from
last
week
they
gave
me
the
endorsement
yesterday
and
i
was
very
honored
log
cabin
the
log
cabin
group
and
i
was
very
honored
to
receive
it
no
i've
done
very
well
with
that
community
trump
continued
some
of
my
biggest
supporters
are
of
that
community
and
i
think
they
and
i
talk
to
them
a
lot
about
it
i
think
i've
done
really
very
well
with
our
community
he
also
referenced
support
from
republican
billionaire
and
venture
capitalist
peter
thiel
who
is
openly
gay
and
once
more
mentioned
the
endorsement
from
the
log
cabin
group
just
last
week
trump's
labor
department
issued
a
new
rule
that
would
allow
federal
contractors
to
wantonly
discriminate
against
lgbtq
workers
as
their
religious
beliefs
dictate
the
justice
department
also
submitted
a
brief
to
the
supreme
court
arguing
it
should
be
totally
legal
to
fire
people
for
being
transgender
an
argument
that
would
weaken
sex
discrimination
protections
as
well
those
were
only
the
two
most
recent
examples
in
a
long
litany
of
actions
the
administration
has
taken
to
dismantle
lgbtq
protections
especially
those
protecting
transgender
and
non-binary
people
the
endorsement
of
the
log
cabin
republicans
lcr
has
also
proved
incredibly
divisive
among
those
who
previously
belonged
to
the
organization
casey
pick
a
former
lcr
leader
penned
a
lengthy
reflection
about
how
the
organization
she
once
knew
no
longer
exists
concluding
call
me
any
name
you
please
and
i
know
folks
will
but
please
don't
call
me
a
log
cabin
republican
robert
turner
former
head
of
the
washington
d.c.
lcr
chapter
also
withdrew
his
membership
claiming
the
endorsement
of
trump
is
a
step
too
far
one
that
leaves
him
sad
jennifer
horn
a
member
of
the
lcr
national
board
submitted
her
resignation
monday
night
over
the
trump
endorsement
there
is
no
world
where
i
can
sit
down
at
the
dining
room
table
and
explain
to
my
children
that
i
just
endorsed
donald
trump
for
president
she
told
the
washington
post
it
is
contrary
to
everything
that
i
have
ever
taught
them
about
what
it
means
to
be
a
good
decent
principled
member
of
society
for
all
the
internal
fallout
today's
comments
suggest
the
lcr
endorsement
is
accomplishing
exactly
what
it
intended
to
provide
cover
despite
trump's
atrocious
anti-lgbtq
record
the
organization
may
represent
an
exceedingly
minuscule
number
of
people
but
it
still
gives
trump
something
to
talk
about
instead
of
the
actions
he's
actually
taken
