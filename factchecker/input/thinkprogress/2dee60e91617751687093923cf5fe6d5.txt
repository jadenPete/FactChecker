poop
every
other
day
to
save
earth
says
brazilian
president
as
he
destroys
the
amazon
jair
bolsonaro
proves
once
again
why
he
is
the
trump
of
the
tropics
with
a
string
of
inane
comments
meant
to
distract
people
brazil's
president
jair
bolsonaro
keeps
re-earning
the
title
of
the
brazilian
trump
his
latest
crazy
comment
came
friday
when
he
said
that
one
way
to
save
the
environment
is
if
people
poop
every
other
day
but
many
in
the
media
missed
the
key
context
bolsonaro
is
not
someone
who
cares
about
the
environment
he
is
someone
who
is
in
fact
accelerating
the
deforestation
of
the
brazilian
rainforest
and
who
says
crazy
stuff
just
to
get
the
attention
or
cause
distraction
bolsonaro's
comment
was
the
result
of
a
reporter
asking
him
about
whether
brazil
can
simultaneously
grow
more
food
while
protecting
the
environment
and
this
question
is
the
crucial
context
to
understand
bolsonaro's
reply
it's
enough
to
eat
a
little
less
you
talk
about
environmental
pollution
it's
enough
to
poop
every
other
day
that
will
be
better
for
the
whole
world
reacting
to
the
statement
cal
perry
a
correspondent
for
nbc
news
international
tweeted
a
link
to
a
bbc
article
on
bolsonaro's
statement
arguing
and
people
say
world
leaders
are
out
of
touch
on
climate
change
but
this
tweet
makes
no
sense
because
no
one
ever
said
bolsonaro
was
in
touch
on
climate
change
much
as
no
one
ever
said
president
donald
trump
was
quite
the
reverse
the
bbc
article
explains
the
reality
of
what
bolsonaro
is
doing
to
the
environment
in
brazil
bolsonaro's
comment
came
after
a
journalist
quoted
reports
saying
deforestation
and
agriculture
were
responsible
for
a
quarter
of
the
planet's
greenhouse
effect
the
bbc
also
noted
that
the
brazilian
president
recently
came
under
fire
after
official
data
showed
an
increase
in
deforestation
in
the
amazon
indeed
brazil's
own
national
institute
for
space
research
has
reported
that
square
miles
of
the
amazon
were
clear-cut
last
month
an
astounding
increase
from
a
year
ago
the
amazon
rain
forest
helps
combat
climate
change
by
storing
vast
amounts
of
carbon
in
its
soil
and
vegetation
on
top
of
that
as
the
bbc
noted
on
august
the
brazilian
president
sacked
the
head
of
the
agency
that
reported
the
increase
emphasis
in
original
and
like
trump
bolsonaro
has
appointed
pro-industry
anti-environmental
types
to
run
his
environmental
policy
given
that
context
bolsonaro's
comment
is
not
only
absurd
but
it
would
appear
to
be
intentionally
absurd
even
fox
news
noted
it
wasn't
clear
if
bolsonaro
was
being
sarcastic
but
in
one
particularly
bizarre
media
reaction
bolsonaro's
bizarre
comment
was
that
forbes
actually
ran
an
entire
column
as
if
it
were
a
serious
solution
brazil's
president
what
is
wrong
with
his
poop
advice
the
column
opens
with
a
question
what's
most
to
blame
for
messing
up
the
environment
how
about
you
and
your
selfish
insistence
on
pooping
when
you
have
to
do
so
it
continues
in
this
vein
noting
to
my
knowledge
bolsonaro
is
not
sic
medical
doctor
and
there
is
no
established
specific
recommended
frequency
for
pooping
but
the
point
of
this
column
becomes
clear
at
the
end
when
the
author
poses
a
question
about
how
much
you
eat
and
poop
asking
do
you
really
want
the
government
to
regulate
you
to
that
end
no
you
can't
make
this
poop
up
only
in
a
world
devoid
of
context
could
bolsonaro
be
used
as
an
example
of
some
sort
of
environmentalist
reaching
too
far
to
regulate
human
behavior
as
opposed
to
what
he
is
brazil's
donald
trump
an
anti-environmental
extremist
