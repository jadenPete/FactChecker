gop
politicians
are
using
video
games
as
a
scapegoat
for
mass
shootings
and
it's
working
espn
and
abc
have
canceled
an
esports
broadcast
and
walmart
has
taken
down
violent
video
game
displays
in
the
week
since
two
mass
shootings
in
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
and
a
nightlife
district
in
dayton
ohio
left
people
dead
and
a
nation
reeling
once
again
any
actual
progress
on
gun
control
has
been
nonexistent
guns
continue
to
be
sold
at
walmart
and
the
threat
of
domestic
terrorism
and
president
donald
trump's
racist
rhetoric
and
policies
have
been
downplayed
or
outright
excused
it's
not
like
policymakers
and
corporate
executives
have
been
twiddling
their
collective
thumbs
this
whole
time
though
they
have
made
significant
progress
on
one
front
the
war
against
video
games
despite
the
fact
that
studies
over
a
period
of
decades
have
debunked
the
myth
that
video
games
inspire
violence
this
week
espn
canceled
the
broadcast
of
an
esports
event
and
walmart
a
store
that
still
sells
shotguns
and
sporting
rifles
ordered
its
stores
to
take
down
displays
that
feature
violent
video
game
imagery
what
you
are
witnessing
is
not
to
be
confused
with
progress
video
games
are
being
used
as
a
scapegoat
a
surface-level
distraction
from
the
real
problem
but
it's
also
not
surprising
less
than
hours
after
the
two
mass
shootings
gop
politicians
were
already
on
television
pivoting
the
blame
to
video
games
and
away
from
white
supremacy
and
guns
the
idea
that
these
video
games
that
dehumanize
individuals
to
have
a
game
of
shooting
individuals
i've
always
felt
that
it's
a
problem
for
future
generations
and
others
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-ca
said
on
fox
news
we've
watched
studies
show
what
it
does
to
individuals
and
you
look
at
these
photos
of
how
it
took
place
you
can
see
the
actions
within
video
games
and
others
trump
echoed
that
sentiment
when
he
addressed
the
nation
on
monday
we
must
stop
the
glorification
of
violence
in
our
society
this
includes
the
gruesome
and
grisly
video
games
that
are
now
commonplace
it
is
too
easy
today
for
troubled
youth
to
surround
themselves
with
a
culture
that
celebrates
violence
trump
said
on
monday
in
an
address
to
the
nation
soon
after
trump's
speech
espn
and
abc
decided
not
to
broadcast
the
xgames
apex
legends
exp
invitational
this
weekend
out
of
respect
for
the
victims
and
all
those
impacted
by
the
recent
shootings
espn
hosted
this
event
on
august
and
but
the
coverage
was
supposed
to
air
on
sunday
now
the
broadcast
has
been
delayed
to
october
rod
breslau
an
esports
consultant
broke
the
news
on
twitter
earlier
this
week
and
his
report
was
confirmed
by
bloomberg
apex
legends
is
a
violent
game
that
hinges
on
shooting
but
not
one
that
is
notable
for
its
realism
apex
legends
is
a
first-person
shooter
battle
royale
game
from
ea
and
respawn
entertainment
it
pits
teams
of
three
against
one
another
in
an
ever-shrinking
map
until
one
one
team
survives
reported
the
hollywood
reporter
unlike
more
realistic
shooters
such
as
call
of
duty
apex
legends
is
marked
by
a
more
cartoonish
art
style
and
does
not
feature
blood
or
gore
it
is
rated
t
for
teen
by
the
entertainment
software
rating
board
and
even
if
it
were
realistic
it's
crucial
to
remember
there
is
no
proof
that
violent
video
games
are
in
any
way
related
to
mass
shootings
if
you
don't
believe
the
research
on
the
subject
common
sense
should
be
enough
to
prove
this
false
the
united
states
is
far
from
the
only
wealthy
country
with
a
video
game
obsession
it
is
however
the
only
one
with
a
mass
shooting
epidemic
but
those
in
charge
are
showing
no
signs
that
they're
willing
to
take
meaningful
action
in
fact
on
friday
morning
trump
reiterated
his
support
for
the
national
rifle
association
nra
and
the
second
amendment
and
he
has
continued
to
fan
the
flames
of
racism
and
division
in
the
united
states
all
week
long
including
during
a
visit
to
the
el
paso
hospital
where
many
of
the
victims
were
treated
taking
down
violent
imagery
and
canceling
an
esports
broadcast
won't
save
any
lives
and
the
meaningless
actions
certainly
aren't
respectful
to
the
lives
that
were
lost
last
weekend
this
isn't
progress
it's
a
performative
charade
designed
to
protect
those
in
power
and
so
far
it's
working
exactly
as
designed
