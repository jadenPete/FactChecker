new
legislation
aims
to
criminalize
all
sides
of
foreign
bribery
for
years
it
was
only
illegal
for
americans
to
pay
bribes
to
foreigners
a
new
bill
aims
to
criminalize
the
entire
process
for
years
the
u.s.
s
foreign
corrupt
practices
act
fcpa
stood
as
something
of
a
gold
standard
among
international
anti-bribery
legislation
however
the
fcpa
first
written
into
law
in
suffered
from
one
major
flaw
it
only
criminalized
the
act
of
americans
giving
bribes
not
the
act
of
demanding
bribes
from
american
individuals
and
companies
in
the
first
place
but
a
new
bill
introduced
last
week
aims
to
fix
this
loophole
and
set
a
new
bar
for
how
far
anti-bribery
legislation
can
go
co-sponsored
by
a
bipartisan
group
of
legislators
the
foreign
extortion
prevention
act
fepa
will
criminalize
any
and
all
extortion
by
foreign
officials
the
bill
will
effectively
act
as
a
complement
to
the
fcpa
allowing
the
u.s.
to
criminalize
the
entire
process
of
bribery
involving
americans
abroad
the
current
text
of
the
bill
proposes
potential
fines
and
jail-time
for
those
found
guilty
of
demanding
bribes
from
american
companies
and
individuals
abroad
currently
a
business
being
extorted
for
a
bribe
can
only
say
i
can't
pay
you
a
bribe
because
it
is
illegal
and
i
might
get
arrested
rep
john
curtis
r-ut
one
of
the
bill's
co-sponsors
said
in
a
statement
this
long-overdue
bill
would
enable
them
to
add
and
so
will
you
americans
who
pay
bribes
overseas
can
be
prosecuted
with
this
bill
our
prosecutors
will
be
able
to
go
after
the
foreign
officials
who
demand
those
bribes
added
tom
malinowski
d-nj
another
co-sponsor
we're
giving
the
justice
department
a
powerful
new
tool
to
fight
the
kleptocracy
that
impoverishes
people
and
empowers
dictators
around
the
world
one
of
the
biggest
questions
surrounding
the
bill
which
has
been
referred
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
involves
jurisdictional
concerns
foreign
officials
found
guilty
of
breaching
fepa
may
never
see
any
retribution
especially
if
they
remain
abroad
following
any
potential
conviction
however
for
those
pushing
the
bill
imprisoning
people
who
demand
bribes
of
americans
isn't
the
sole
potential
outcome
one
fepa
becomes
law
even
if
a
kleptocrat
cannot
be
immediately
extradited
a
u.s.
indictment
serves
as
a
play-by-play
of
the
crime
committed
that
can
be
used
to
support
additional
measures
such
as
sanctions
and
can
force
transnational
criminals
to
think
twice
before
traveling
abroad
to
spend
their
ill-gotten
gains
said
rep
richard
hudson
r-nc
one
of
the
co-sponsors
fepa
would
also
bring
the
u.s.
in
line
with
anti-bribery
legislation
elsewhere
following
a
model
already
set
in
countries
including
switzerland
france
and
the
u.k.
amending
u.s.
criminal
law
to
cover
bribe-receiving
would
bring
the
united
states
closer
to
international
best
practices
and
would
further
the
u.s.
government's
efforts
to
stamp
out
transnational
corruption
wrote
tom
firestone
a
partner
at
baker
mckenzie
and
noted
expert
on
the
fcpa
but
it
would
also
protect
honest
businesses
which
are
increasingly
faced
with
illegal
demands
from
foreign
officials
in
corrupt
regimes
and
unscrupulous
competition
from
companies
including
state-owned
enterprises
in
such
countries
if
the
fcpa's
precedent
is
anything
to
go
by
the
fepa
could
quickly
become
one
of
the
foremost
tools
in
cracking
down
on
bribery
abroad
while
fcpa
enforcement
remained
negligible
in
its
first
few
decades
it's
since
become
one
of
the
go-to
tools
for
american
officials
looking
to
unwind
kleptocratic
networks
abroad
as
well
as
holding
to
account
those
american
individuals
and
companies
fanning
corrupt
networks
previous
fcpa
enforcement
actions
have
even
reached
as
high
as
presidential
levels
abroad
with
one
notable
and
notorious
case
involving
the
former
kazakhstani
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
who
received
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
on
behalf
of
american
energy
companies
according
to
the
university
of
cambridge's
jason
sharman
it
was
the
fcpa's
inception
that
jump-started
the
u.s.
s
unusual
commitment
to
the
cause
of
fighting
international
corruption
a
pattern
that
the
fepa
seeks
to
continue
president
donald
trump
for
his
part
referred
to
the
fcpa
before
his
presidency
as
a
horrible
law
questions
remain
about
the
trump
organization's
potential
breach
of
fcpa
violations
in
the
past
most
especially
surrounding
the
trump
organization's
now-defunct
in
azerbaijan
congress
currently
shows
surprisingly
little
appetite
to
pursue
the
questions
surrounding
that
project
but
the
passage
of
fepa
may
present
renewed
interest
the
fepa
bill
builds
on
a
sudden
burst
of
anti-kleptocracy
momentum
in
congress
over
the
past
few
months
other
proposed
bills
include
things
like
the
crook
act
which
would
direct
percent
of
all
fcpa-related
fines
to
a
broader
anti-corruption
fund
as
well
as
another
bill
that
would
permit
the
secretary
of
state
to
publicize
all
foreigners
barred
from
the
u.s.
on
account
of
corruption
allegations
these
bills
as
well
as
the
fepa
legislation
all
come
with
the
backing
of
the
helsinki
commission
an
independent
u.s.
federal
agency
focusing
on
human
rights
and
pro-democracy
policies
