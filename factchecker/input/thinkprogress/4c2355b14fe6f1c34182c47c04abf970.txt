louisiana's
shockingly
dishonest
plan
to
abolish
roe
v
wade
anti-abortion
lawyers
aren't
even
trying
to
make
plausible
arguments
anymore
a
panel
of
extraordinarily
conservative
republican
judges
will
hear
a
case
on
friday
that
if
successful
would
drain
all
life
from
the
right
to
an
abortion
in
gee
v
june
medical
services
the
state
of
louisiana
argues
that
abortion
restrictions
should
effectively
be
immune
from
judicial
scrutiny
just
so
long
as
lawmakers
are
clever
about
how
they
draft
those
laws
the
conservative
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
will
hear
the
case
on
friday
is
overwhelmingly
likely
to
embrace
this
legal
theory
and
while
there
is
some
doubt
about
whether
the
supreme
court
will
endorse
this
particular
attack
on
roe
v
wade
the
death
of
roe
is
all
but
certain
after
the
confirmation
of
trump
supreme
court
appointee
brett
kavanaugh
gee
involves
an
interlocking
web
of
abortion
regulations
that
lawyers
representing
an
abortion
clinic
and
several
providers
describe
as
sham
health
statutes
that
is
the
regulations
impose
licensure
requirements
and
similar
restrictions
that
at
a
cursory
glance
appear
designed
to
make
abortion
safer
in
reality
however
the
lawyers
say
that
the
real
purpose
of
these
restrictions
is
to
impose
onerous
regulations
that
do
little
or
nothing
to
promote
women's
health
and
serve
only
to
impede
access
to
abortion
care
in
that
respect
the
louisiana
restrictions
closely
resemble
the
texas
law
that
the
supreme
court
struck
down
in
whole
woman's
health
v
hellerstedt
that
law
required
abortion
providers
to
maintain
a
difficult-to-obtain
credential
in
order
to
perform
abortions
in
texas
while
also
requiring
that
abortion
clinics
comply
with
expensive
and
unnecessary
building
regulations
louisiana's
primary
defense
of
its
scheme
is
that
it
should
be
largely
immune
from
challenge
because
it
involves
a
lot
of
different
legal
provisions
the
general
rule
in
abortion
cases
is
that
an
abortion
restriction
is
unconstitutional
if
it
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
pregnant
individuals
access
to
abortion
the
louisiana
scheme
involves
abortion
clinic
licensing
regulations
and
the
state
argues
that
courts
must
evaluate
each
of
these
separate
regulations
one
at
a
time
in
essence
louisiana
claims
if
a
state
enacts
a
complex
web
of
regulations
that
when
acting
together
impose
an
undue
burden
on
the
right
to
choose
that's
not
sufficient
grounds
to
strike
down
the
overall
scheme
instead
each
individual
piece
of
this
scheme
must
be
evaluated
separately
and
if
no
one
part
of
the
scheme
imposes
an
undue
burden
when
evaluated
in
isolation
well
that's
just
too
bad
this
argument
isn't
just
wrong
it's
embarrassingly
wrong
recall
that
whole
woman's
health
involved
a
complex
list
of
architectural
requirements
imposed
on
abortion
clinics
some
of
the
individual
provisions
were
relatively
minor
such
as
a
provision
requiring
water
fountains
to
be
designed
so
that
the
water
issues
at
an
angle
from
the
vertical
among
other
things
yet
the
supreme
court
did
not
conduct
a
line-by-line
evaluation
of
each
provision
of
texas
scheme
assessing
whether
it
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
the
right
to
an
abortion
if
say
the
clinics
doorways
must
be
at
least
three
feet
wide
or
if
the
clinics
hvac
systems
were
required
to
meet
certain
specifications
or
if
water
fountains
had
to
squirt
water
at
an
angle
no
the
supreme
court
struck
down
this
entire
scheme
and
the
reason
should
be
obvious
under
the
framework
louisiana
proposes
a
state
could
make
it
cost-prohibitive
to
operate
an
abortion
clinic
just
so
long
as
the
state
did
so
with
a
thousand
rules
that
each
taken
in
isolation
imposed
manageable
expenses
so
louisiana's
argument
is
both
inconsistent
with
existing
law
and
a
fairly
transparent
effort
to
allow
states
to
ban
abortion
outright
unfortunately
for
the
providers
suing
the
state
louisiana
is
also
likely
to
prevail
the
fifth
circuit
panel
hearing
gee
is
judges
priscilla
owen
don
willett
and
andrew
oldham
a
former
justice
on
the
texas
supreme
court
owen
once
wrote
an
anti-abortion
opinion
that
was
so
aggressive
that
her
colleague
justice
alberto
gonzales
denounced
it
as
an
unconscionable
act
of
judicial
activism
and
yes
we're
talking
about
that
alberto
gonzales
owen
is
if
anything
the
most
moderate
member
of
this
panel
in
the
likely
event
that
this
panel
signs
onto
louisiana's
attack
on
roe
there
is
a
decent
chance
the
decision
will
be
temporarily
stayed
last
february
chief
justice
john
roberts
joined
the
supreme
court's
liberal
bloc
after
the
fifth
circuit
decided
it
did
not
have
to
follow
whole
woman's
health
in
another
abortion
case
but
roberts
vote
in
that
case
almost
certainly
was
just
an
effort
to
maintain
the
supreme
court's
position
at
the
top
of
the
judicial
food
chain
the
fifth
circuit
cannot
overrule
whole
woman's
health
or
roe
for
that
matter
only
the
supreme
court
may
overrule
a
supreme
court
opinion
and
roberts
wasn't
about
to
let
the
fifth
circuit
forget
that
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
roberts
who
has
consistently
voted
against
abortion
rights
will
ultimately
vote
to
save
roe
barring
a
change
in
the
supreme
court's
membership
the
right
to
an
abortion
is
almost
certainly
doomed
