workers
stage
a
walkout
to
protest
gun
sales
at
walmart
stores
there's
an
intense
irony
that
walmart
continues
to
sell
guns
despite
the
constant
shootings
in
its
stores
dozens
of
walmart
workers
at
an
e-commerce
facility
in
san
bruno
california
walked
out
wednesday
to
protest
the
retailer's
continued
sale
of
firearms
despite
two
recent
deadly
mass
shootings
the
or
so
employees
stood
outside
in
a
circle
for
minutes
according
to
the
washington
post
gathered
together
the
group
hung
their
heads
during
a
moment
of
silence
for
victims
of
the
recent
gun
violence
among
the
group
was
e-commerce
employee
kate
kesner
who
helped
organize
the
protest
there's
an
intense
irony
that
walmart
continues
to
sell
guns
despite
the
constant
shootings
in
its
stores
kesner
said
while
walmart
the
second
largest
retailer
in
the
world
stopped
selling
assault
rifles
in
it
still
sells
firearms
in
about
half
of
its
u.s.
stores
the
retailer
also
continues
to
make
headlines
for
its
sale
of
a
bullet
resistant
backpack
tom
misner
an
operations
manager
at
the
san
bruno
site
told
the
post
that
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
second
amendment
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
has
included
weapons
of
mass
destruction
he
hopes
that
the
company
which
also
donates
to
politicians
who
accept
funding
from
the
national
rifle
association
nra
would
use
its
might
to
fight
for
make-sense
gun
policy
congress
will
not
do
anything
he
told
the
post
the
walkout
at
walmart
comes
just
days
after
saturday's
mass
shooting
at
an
el
paso
texas
walmart
that
killed
people
several
hours
later
a
gunman
opened
fire
early
sunday
outside
a
popular
nightclub
in
dayton
ohio
killing
nine
people
including
his
sister
mass
shootings
claim
multiple
lives
and
grab
headlines
but
account
for
just
a
small
fraction
of
the
deaths
attributed
to
gun
violence
days
before
the
el
paso
shooting
walmart
became
the
venue
for
another
deadly
shooting
in
mississippi
a
disgruntled
ex-employee
returned
to
the
store
and
shot
and
killed
two
managers
before
being
shot
and
injured
by
police
on
wednesday
two
men
were
arrested
at
a
walmart
in
baton
rouge
louisiana
for
an
isolated
incident
involving
a
gun
after
one
pulled
a
pair
of
scissors
on
the
other
during
an
argument
the
second
brandished
his
firearm
sending
nearby
patrons
into
a
panic
given
the
recurring
violent
incidents
walmart
removing
firearms
completely
from
its
shelves
would
seem
like
a
no-brainer
to
some
but
another
retailer
dick's
sporting
goods
experienced
a
decline
in
sales
in
an
apparent
backlash
after
removing
firearms
and
ammunition
from
its
stores
in
still
while
walmart
could
play
a
very
important
role
in
the
fight
to
end
gun
violence
which
side
of
history
they
will
be
on
stands
to
be
determined
so
far
company
officials
have
told
the
post
that
they
believe
there
are
more
constructive
ways
for
workers
to
voice
their
concerns
than
staging
a
protest
there
are
more
effective
channels
such
as
email
or
leadership
conversations
the
vast
majority
of
our
associates
who
want
to
share
their
views
are
taking
advantage
of
those
options
said
randy
hargrove
a
spokesperson
for
the
retailer
organizers
of
the
san
bruno
protest
also
started
a
change
org
petition
to
call
on
company
executives
to
stop
selling
firearms
and
as
of
publication
it
was
just
signatures
shy
of
its
goal
