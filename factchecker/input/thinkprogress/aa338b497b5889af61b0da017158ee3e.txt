more
than
guns
taken
out
of
circulation
through
new
zealand's
ambitious
buyback
program
imagine
that
a
country
that
acts
in
response
to
mass
shootings
a
far-right
mass
murderer
opens
fire
on
a
crowd
of
worshippers
his
guns
discharge
hundreds
of
rounds
in
a
matter
of
minutes
bullets
enter
dozens
of
bodies
indiscriminately
fifty-one
people
die
a
further
are
injured
it
is
the
deadliest
domestic
attack
in
modern
history
within
days
lawmakers
vow
to
take
decisive
action
legislation
is
drafted
to
ban
nearly
all
semi-automatic
weapons
high
capacity
magazines
are
prohibited
a
gun
buyback
program
is
announced
these
measures
receive
widespread
bipartisan
support
and
are
signed
into
law
less
than
a
month
after
the
attack
oh
what
it
must
be
like
to
live
anywhere
except
the
united
states
the
sequence
of
events
transpired
earlier
this
year
in
new
zealand
where
a
white
supremacist
zealot
gunned
down
more
than
people
at
a
mosque
in
the
city
of
christchurch
it
was
the
deadliest
mass
shooting
in
the
country's
history
and
within
hours
prime
minister
jacinda
ardern
addressed
the
country
and
vowed
to
take
swift
action
to
prevent
future
atrocities
one
of
the
first
steps
she
unveiled
was
to
announce
a
voluntary
gun
buyback
program
wherein
gun
owners
could
trade
in
their
firearms
in
exchange
for
cash
at
up
to
of
the
value
of
their
gun
they
included
an
amnesty
clause
as
well
meaning
anyone
with
a
gun
obtained
illegally
could
also
turn
it
in
without
legal
repercussions
just
one
month
into
the
buyback
program
authorities
have
taken
more
than
guns
out
of
circulation
nearly
different
buyback
events
have
been
staged
so
far
throughout
the
country
and
officials
expect
to
hold
at
least
more
between
now
and
december
when
it
officially
becomes
illegal
to
possess
semi-automatic
guns
high
capacity
magazines
and
other
newly
banned
weapons
the
effectiveness
of
the
buyback
program
is
a
blow
to
pro-gun
groups
in
new
zealand
and
abroad
they
were
gleeful
at
first
after
arden's
initial
call
for
the
voluntary
surrender
of
weapons
was
met
with
a
tepid
response
in
the
first
few
days
after
her
widely
lauded
public
address
in
march
in
which
she
asked
people
to
turn
in
their
deadly
weapons
just
guns
were
turned
into
police
by
the
end
of
june
the
number
had
only
risen
to
about
in
a
country
with
more
than
a
million
firearms
but
since
the
buyback
program
was
launched
the
rates
have
shot
up
we
have
been
really
happy
with
new
zealand's
engagement
and
response
to
this
process
and
we
look
forward
to
more
people
taking
part
in
the
buyback
scheme
over
the
coming
months
read
a
statement
issued
by
new
zealand
police
gun
buybacks
have
been
tried
elsewhere
including
in
the
united
states
with
varying
degrees
of
effectiveness
when
administered
properly
though
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
a
gun
buyback
program
can
have
a
measurable
impact
on
violent
crime
in
boston
a
buyback
program
gave
participants
gift
cards
in
exchange
for
a
handgun
the
following
year
the
number
of
shootings
in
the
city
fell
by
and
continued
to
fall
for
years
afterwards
in
australia
a
mandatory
gun
buyback
program
implemented
in
the
wake
of
a
mass
shooting
in
the
mid-
s
resulted
in
a
reduction
of
gun-related
suicides
and
homicides
of
roughly
according
to
an
analysis
from
researchers
at
harvard
university
