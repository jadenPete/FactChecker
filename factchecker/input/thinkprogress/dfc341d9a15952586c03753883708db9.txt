publisher
of
anti-lgbtq
editorial
inexplicably
blames
poor
proofreading
the
ceo
of
the
newspaper
chain
pittsburgh
pirates
owner
robert
nutting
reportedly
found
the
screed
unintentionally
problematic
the
publisher
of
a
daily
virginia
newspaper
that
printed
an
anti-lgbtq
editorial
earlier
this
month
questioning
both
the
right
of
same-sex
couples
to
marry
and
the
very
existence
of
transgender
people
reportedly
called
the
screed
an
honest
mistake
and
an
error
of
proofreading
the
comments
came
after
the
publisher
and
the
ceo
of
the
newspaper
chain
pittsburgh
pirates
owner
robert
nutting
spoke
and
agreed
the
attack
was
unintentional
on
monday
thinkprogress
reported
the
winchester
star
a
paper
owned
by
nutting's
odgen
newspapers
chains
recently
ran
an
editorial
attacking
virginia
gov
ralph
northam
d
for
touting
virginia's
dubious
st
century
achievements
i
e
homosexual
marriage
elevation
of
the
transgender
lifestyle
etc
the
paper's
publisher
mike
gochenour
told
thinkprogress
that
his
paper
has
a
long
history
of
supporting
and
advocating
for
lgbtq
rights
and
will
continue
to
do
so
attempting
to
justify
the
complaint
about
homosexual
marriage
as
a
poorly
worded
criticism
of
the
way
marriage
equality
came
to
virginia
the
federal
courts
struck
down
virginia's
unconstitutional
prohibition
on
same-sex
unions
in
and
the
supreme
court
overturned
all
such
bans
in
gochenour
did
not
respond
to
questions
about
how
erasing
transgender
people's
identities
as
the
editorial
did
was
supportive
of
lgbtq
rights
on
thursday
outsports
reported
that
following
reporting
by
thinkprogress
and
blue
virginia
it
had
reached
out
to
gochenour
and
spoken
with
him
about
the
editorial
outsports
noted
that
despite
gochenour's
suggestions
that
the
anti-lgbtq
editorial
was
a
mere
error
of
proofreading
as
of
press
time
it
had
still
not
been
edited
corrected
or
removed
from
the
paper's
website
nutting
has
still
not
responded
to
questions
from
outsports
and
thinkprogress
about
the
incident
his
pittsburgh
pirates
like
many
major
league
baseball
teams
have
attempted
to
present
themselves
as
lgbtq-inclusive
hosting
an
annual
pride
day
and
posting
an
it
gets
better
video
thinkprogress
reached
out
to
gochenour
again
to
followup
on
thursday
morning
he
did
not
immediately
respond
update
after
thinkprogress
reached
out
on
thursday
morning
the
editorial
was
deleted
from
the

not
explained
the
decision
publicly
