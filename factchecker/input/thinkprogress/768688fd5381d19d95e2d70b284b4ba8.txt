ken
cuccinelli
just
took
his
racist
interpretation
of
the
statue
of
liberty
poem
to
another
level
the
poem
only
refers
to
welcoming
people
from
europe
he
claimed
this
week
ken
cuccinelli
acting
director
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
uscis
was
roundly
criticized
for
comments
he
made
tuesday
on
npr
suggesting
that
the
statue
of
liberty's
poem
was
only
meant
to
welcome
immigrants
who
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
tuesday
evening
he
doubled
down
by
suggesting
the
poem
only
applied
to
people
coming
from
europe
where
they
had
class-based
societies
cnn
host
erin
burnett
was
grilling
cuccinelli
about
his
earlier
remarks
noting
that
the
emma
lazarus
poem
the
new
colossus
written
in
and
inscribed
on
the
statue
of
liberty
in
specifically
describes
people
who
have
nothing
give
me
your
tired
your
poor
your
huddled
masses
yearning
to
breathe
free
the
poem
excerpt
reads
the
wretched
refuse
of
your
teeming
shore
send
these
the
homeless
tempest-tossed
to
me
i
lift
my
lamp
beside
the
golden
door
it
does
not
refer
to
people
who
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
as
cuccinelli
had
said
earlier
in
the
day
burnett
asked
cuccinelli
what
he
believed
america
stood
for
cuccinelli
responded
that
the
poem
only
referred
to
class-based
societies
in
europe
where
people
were
considered
wretched
if
they
weren't
in
the
right
class
he
justified
his
reinterpretation
claiming
other
laws
passed
in
the
early
th
century
were
similar
to
the
new
public
charge
rule
the
trump
administration
is
imposing
which
limits
legal
immigrants
from
receiving
any
kind
of
public
assistance
burnett
noted
that
under
the
new
rules
her
own
grandfather
would
not
have
been
able
to
come
to
the
united
states
cuccinelli
is
not
the
first
trump
official
to
try
to
distort
the
new
colossus
in
an
attempt
to
justify
the
administration's
xenophobic
immigration
policies
senior
policy
adviser
stephen
miller
the
architect
of
all
of
these
anti-immigration
efforts
tried
to
downplay
the
significance
of
the
poem
two
years
ago
because
the
poem
was
only
added
later
decades
after
the
statue's
construction
had
completed
in
august
miller
was
defending
his
proposal
to
restrict
immigration
to
only
those
who
speak
english
fluently
cnn's
jim
acosta
asked
him
whether
this
comported
with
lazarus
words
about
how
welcoming
the
country
should
be
the
poem
that
you're
referring
to
that
was
added
later
is
not
actually
a
part
of
the
original
statue
of
liberty
miller
responded
while
it's
technically
true
that
the
plaque
bearing
an
excerpt
of
the
poem
was
only
added
in
the
poem
was
composed
in
as
part
of
the
original
fundraising
efforts
for
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
the
pedestal
was
only
completed
in
following
which
the
statue
was
assembled
and
then
dedicated
that
same
year
many
white
supremacists
including
former
kkk
grand
wizard
david
duke
and
neo-nazi
richard
spencer
have
likewise
criticized
the
poem
duke
believes
lazarus
was
anxious
to
turn
america
into
a
refuge
for
the
castoffs
of
the
world
while
spencer
once
described
the
inscription
as
embodying
ugliness
weakness
and
deformity
by
admitting
that
he
believed
the
invitation
to
immigrants
only
applies
to
europeans
cuccinelli
was
saying
the
quiet
part
out
loud
that
trump's
immigration
policy
is
designed
to
institutionalize
racism
