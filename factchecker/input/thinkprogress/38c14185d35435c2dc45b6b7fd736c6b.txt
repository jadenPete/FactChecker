trump
describes
boris
johnson
as
someone
who
knows
how
to
win
after
historic
parliament
defeats
meanwhile
boris
johnson's
own
brother
just
resigned
from
the
conservative
party
british
prime
minister
boris
johnson
can't
stop
losing
his
plan
to
keep
a
no-deal
brexit
on
the
cards
which
johnson
insists
is
necessary
despite
the
catastrophic
economic
damage
it
could
cause
was
defeated
twice
in
the
houses
of
parliament
on
wednesday
shortly
after
johnson
was
defeated
by
parliament
in
his
attempt
to
call
a
general
election
there
is
also
mounting
anger
within
the
conservative
party
on
johnson's
decision
to
expel
conservative
members
of
parliament
mp
from
the
party
who
were
all
opposed
to
letting
britain
leave
the
european
union
without
a
deal
but
according
to
president
donald
trump
johnson
is
in
fact
doing
a
superb
job
boris
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
he's
going
at
it
there's
no
question
about
it
trump
told
reporters
on
wednesday
afternoon
he
knows
how
to
win
boris
knows
how
to
win
don't
worry
about
him
he's
going
to
be
ok
then
on
thursday
johnson
who
once
said
that
trump
had
a
quite
stupefying
ignorance
that
makes
him
frankly
unfit
to
hold
the
office
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
suffered
yet
another
defeat
and
this
one
was
much
more
personal
jo
johnson
boris
younger
brother
and
a
conservative
mp
resigned
from
parliament
in
recent
weeks
i've
been
torn
between
family
loyalty
and
the
national
interest
jo
johnson
tweeted
it's
an
unsolvable
tension
and
time
for
others
to
take
on
my
roles
as
mp
minister
the
fact
that
johnson's
own
brother
has
resigned
from
his
government
barely
a
month-and-a-half
into
his
tenure
as
prime
minister
highlights
the
intractable
conservative
civil
war
at
the
heart
of
the
brexit
debate
which
has
completely
fractured
the
party
this
is
further
emphasized
by
the
prominence
of
a
few
of
the
mps
expelled
by
johnson
earlier
this
week
which
includes
former
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
the
second-most
important
position
in
british
politics
phillip
hammond
as
well
as
nicholas
soames
the
grandson
of
winston
churchill
about
whom
ironically
enough
johnson
previously
wrote
a
biography
trump
for
his
part
previously
promised
that
we're
going
to
do
a
very
big
trade
deal
bigger
than
we've
ever
had
with
the
u.k.
but
whether
that
would
actually
happen
is
as
with
everything
brexit-related
very
much
an
open
question
such
a
trade
deal
would
inevitably
anger
the
united
states
trading
partners
within
the
european
union
both
the
individual
countries
and
the
block
as
a
whole
what's
more
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
warned
that
congress
would
block
any
legislation
if
it
undermines
the
good
friday
peace
agreement
concerning
northern
ireland
the
key
debate
is
over
the
border
separating
the
republic
of
ireland
from
northern
ireland
which
is
part
of
the
united
kingdom
european
officials
are
desperate
to
preserve
the
backstop
i
e
a
seamless
border
between
northern
ireland
and
the
republic
which
was
one
of
the
key
provisions
of
the
good
friday
agreement
johnson
however
has
been
repeatedly
pushing
for
a
hard
border
between
the
two
countries
whatever
form
it
takes
brexit
cannot
be
allowed
to
imperil
the
good
friday
agreement
including
the
seamless
border
between
the
irish
republic
and
northern
ireland
especially
now
as
the
first
generation
born
into
the
hope
of
good
friday
years
ago
comes
into
adulthood
pelosi
said
earlier
in
august
we
cannot
go
back
