hurricane
dorian's
nightmarishly
slow
pace
is
linked
to
climate
change
like
harvey
and
florence
before
it
dorian's
biggest
danger
comes
when
it
stalls
over
land
hurricane
dorian's
historic
destruction
in
the
bahamas
earlier
this
week
is
already
emerging
as
the
latest
example
of
a
disconcerting
trend
the
storm
hit
the
islands
with
category
wind
speeds
and
then
stalled
over
land
for
hours
before
inching
towards
the
united
states
according
to
some
estimates
dorian
may
be
the
slowest-moving
category
hurricane
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
history
dorian's
slow
crawl
is
similar
to
other
major
hurricanes
in
recent
years
and
seems
to
be
an
increasingly
common
trend
for
these
devastating
storms
scientists
worry
climate
change
is
playing
a
role
allowing
hurricanes
to
become
more
destructive
as
they
slow
down
due
to
warming
temperatures
when
they
stall
hurricanes
are
able
to
do
far
more
damage
than
when
they
move
quickly
as
of
wednesday
morning
dorian
was
moving
towards
the
southeastern
united
states
after
decimating
several
bahamian
islands
forecasts
indicate
that
florida
and
georgia
could
largely
be
spared
the
worst
of
the
storm
even
as
images
of
mass-destruction
in
the
bahamas
begin
to
emerge
the
storm
has
weakened
from
a
category
to
a
category
lowering
its
deadly
windspeed
but
expanding
in
size
thereby
widening
the
area
in
its
path
the
national
hurricane
center
nhc
issued
a
warning
in
advance
of
the
storm
forecasting
very
heavy
rainfall
totals
of
up
inches
in
parts
of
the
carolinas
with
flash
flooding
also
a
significant
possibility
the
wider
southeast
is
bracing
for
impacts
into
the
end
of
the
week
including
storm
surges
and
high
winds
it
is
likely
however
that
the
worst
of
dorian's
damages
have
already
happened
in
the
bahamas
after
destroying
much
of
great
abaco
a
mile-wide
island
on
sunday
for
eight
and
a
half
hours
dorian
headed
toward
grand
bahama
there
the
storm
sat
for
hours
moving
at
a
snail's
pace
of
just
over
one
mile
per
hour
sometimes
becoming
completely
stationary
during
that
time
the
storm
did
unprecedented
damage
the
death
toll
in
the
islands
now
stands
at
seven
but
officials
have
said
many
people
remain
unaccounted
for
and
they
expect
the
number
of
casualties
to
rise
around
of
homes
in
impacted
areas
are
also
reportedly
underwater
prime
minister
hubert
minnis
called
the
event
one
of
the
greatest
national
crises
in
our
country's
history
and
said
that
more
would
be
known
in
coming
days
as
the
country
seeks
to
recover
hurricanes
are
naturally
occurring
phenomena
and
it
is
common
for
them
to
stall
especially
over
land
but
they
typically
move
at
a
much
faster
pace
which
can
help
mitigate
the
colossal
damage
they
cause
but
that
hasn't
been
the
case
with
dorian
or
with
other
recent
memorable
hurricanes
in
hurricane
harvey
slammed
into
the
texas
gulf
coast
hovering
over
houston
for
days
and
unleashing
a
mountain
of
water
claiming
dozens
of
lives
and
racking
up
over
billion
in
damages
one
year
later
hurricane
florence
similarly
devastated
the
carolinas
as
it
stalled
over
land
dumping
so
much
rain
it
turned
one
town
into
a
temporary
island
florence
was
only
a
category
storm
when
it
made
landfall
in
the
united
states
but
due
to
its
glacial
pace
and
its
heavy
rains
the
hurricane's
damages
were
catastrophic
a
study
published
in
june
by
federal
scientists
found
that
hurricane
speed
in
the
north
atlantic
ocean
decreased
between
and
while
it
is
hard
to
connect
any
one
disaster
to
climate
change
scientists
have
linked
the
stalling
pace
of
hurricanes
to
slowing
global
winds
which
in
turn
seem
to
be
impacted
by
ice
melt
in
the
arctic
that
trend
means
that
there
could
be
more
storms
like
dorian
in
the
future
and
occurring
more
often
especially
if
recent
years
are
an
indicator
there
have
only
been
atlantic
hurricanes
with
category
speed
winds
in
reordered
history
of
those
five
have
been
in
the
last
four
years
