the

a
daily
newspaper
in
virginia
that
claims
to
be
pro-lgbtq
published
an
editorial
recently
that
both
called
into
question
the
right
of
same-sex
couples
to
marry
and
the
very
existence
of
transgender
people
the

part
of

chain
is
controlled
by

owner
of
the
pittsburgh

baseball
team
robert
nutting
as
first
noted
by
the
progressive
blog
blue
virginia
the
paper
published
an
editorial
on
wednesday
slamming
gov
ralph
northam
d-va
for
boycotting
president
donald
trump's
recent
appearance
at
the
th
anniversary
commemoration
of

jamestown

gov
northam
the
paper
opined
he
made
a
speech
earlier
in
the
day
a
few
hours
before
mr
trump
speaking
not
of
the
tradition's
majesty
but
of
virginia's
dubious
st
century
achievements
i
e
homosexual
marriage
elevation
of
the
transgender
lifestyle
etc
and
then
disgracefully
departed
nowhere
to
be
seen
or
heard
when
mr
trump
spoke
thinkprogress
reached
out
to
nutting
whose
pittsburgh
pirates
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
market
themselves
as
an
lgbtq-friendly
franchise
to
ask
whether
he
stood
by
his
paper's
editorial
nutting
did
not
respond
however
mike
gochenour
publisher
of
the
winchester
star
emailed
on
monday
to
apologize
for
the
confusion
caused
by
the
editorial
the
use
of
the
word
dubious
in
the
editorial
was
in
reference
to
the
process
that
virginia
attorney
general
mark
herring
used
to
legalize
same-sex
marriage
in
virginia
it
was
unilateral
w
no
legislative
process
dubious
was
not
in
reference
to
same-sex
marriage
etc
in
hindsight
the
editorial
page
editor
realizes
that
wasn't
clear
in
his
editorial
and
sees
how
it
could
be
misinterpreted
gochenour
wrote
the
winchester
star
has
a
long
history
of
supporting
and
advocating
for
lgbtq
rights
see
some
links
to
recent
articles
below
and
will
continue
to
do
so
he
added
gochenour
included
links
to
three
previous
news
stories
in
the
publication
that
had
addressed
lgbtq
issues
though
none
were
editorials
he
offered
no
defense
nor
clarification
of
the
anti-transgender
language
the
publisher's
explanation
of
the
term
dubious
does
not
square
with
the
facts
gochenour
claims
that
virginia's
democratic
attorney
general
unilaterally
legalized
same-sex
marriage
in
virginia
but
this
is
demonstrably
false
when
virginians
challenged
the
state's
unconstitutional
ban
on
same-sex
marriages
attorney
general
herring
announced
that
he
agreed
with
their
challenge
and
would
not
use
his
office
to
defend
an
unconstitutional
law
he
did
however
appeal
the
ruling
to
allow
others
to
defend
it
before
the
supreme
court
the
nation's
highest
court
made
clear
in
its
obergefell
ruling
some
months
later
that
virginia's
ban
on
same-sex
marriages
and
all
other
state
bans
were
unconstitutional
the
decision
was
hardly
a
unilateral
fiat
by
herring
but
rather
an
accurate
reading
of
the
u.s.
constitution
gochenour's
claim
that
the
winchester
star
is
clearly
pro-lgbtq
is
not
buttressed
by
the
outdated
homosexual
marriage
phrasing
or
the
suggestion
that
transgender
identities
are
a
lifestyle
the
suggestion
that
protecting
the
legal
rights
of
transgender
people
is
dubious
also
throws
that
assertion
into
question
