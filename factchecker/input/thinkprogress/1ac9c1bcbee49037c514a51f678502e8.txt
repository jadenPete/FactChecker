in
the
same
breath
louisiana
republican
takes
swipe
at
both
gender
minorities
and
abortion
access
and
as
a
doctor
i
can
assure
you
there

only
two
genders
abraham
said
rep
ralph
abraham
r-la
attacked
both
abortion
rights
and
the
transgender
community
in
an
ad
he
rolled
out
on
thursday
for
his
campaign
for
governor
of
louisiana
in
his
advertisement
abraham
declares
what
he
pronounces
to
be
the
truth
proclaiming
that
life
begins
at
conception
and
that
president
donald
trump
is
doing
a
great
job
at
the
end
of
the
spot
he
adds
with
a
smirk
that
as
a
doctor
i
can
assure
you
there
are
only
two
genders
abraham
along
with
baton
rouge
businessman
eddie
rispone
are
the
two
leading
republican
candidates
challenging
gov
john
bel
edwards
d
who
was
elected
in
in
abraham
said
to
subscribers
of
his
newsletter
that
he
was
working
to
restore
congressional
authority
over
how
the
federal
government
can
define
sex
and
gender
according
to
salon
he
was
one
of
five
co-sponsors
of
a
bill
called
the
civil
rights
uniformity
act
of
a
resolution
that
would
state
that
sex
or
gender
could
be
interpreted
as
including
gender
identity
abraham's
legislative
efforts
were
in
response
to
obama-era
protections
for
transgender
students
which
the
trump
administration
has
since
rolled
back
the
bill
abraham
co-sponsored
did
not
ultimately
pass
since
then
the
house
in
may
passed
the
equality
act
a
sweeping
nondiscrimination
bill
that
would
clarify
and
enhance
protections
for
lgbtq
americans
one-hundred
and
seventy-three
house
republicans
voted
against
it
including
abraham
the
senate
has
not
taken
up
the
bill
across
the
globe
there
is
a
long
history
of
recognizing
gender
variance
the
medical
community
has
acknowledged
that
there
is
complexity
in
sex
as
well
as
gender
states
across
the
country
increasingly
are
passing
legislation
that
show
an
awareness
of
nonbinary
constituents
this
legislation
provides
a
third
gender
marker
on
drivers
licenses
and
other
forms
of
government
identification
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
recently
updated
its
website
to
address
how
employers
can
report
workers
as
nonbinary
in
eeo-
reports
twelve
percent
of
millennials
say
they
are
transgender
agender
genderfluid
or
bigender
according
to
a
harris
poll
conducted
on
behalf
of
glaad
some
historians
recently
argued
in
an
amicus
brief
relevant
to
u.s.
supreme
court
cases
on
employment
protections
that
the
understanding
of
sex
in
the
s
s
and
s
was
such
that
lgbtq
people
could
have
been
understood
to
be
included
in
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
they
wrote
this
broad
understanding
of
sex
as
evoking
a
range
of
sex
roles
sexual
expression
and
sexual
instincts
shaped
public
knowledge
about
lgbt
individuals
abraham's
poor
record
on
lgbtq
rights
includes
a
vote
against
a
measure
that
would
have
changed
federal
law
to
make
it
clear
that
queer
veterans
are
entitled
to
spousal
benefits
the
measure
would
have
shown
that
some
veterans
have
spouses
of
the
same
sex
abraham
made
his
anti-abortion
statement
while
running
for
governor
of
a
state
that
has
numerous
abortion
restrictions
including
the
mandate
that
patients
undergo
ultrasounds
hours
before
they
can
receive
an
abortion
parental
consent
requirements
for
minors
and
state-directed
counseling
that
is
meant
to
discourage
patients
from
having
abortions
abortion
would
also
be
banned
if
roe
v
wade
were
overturned
however
louisiana's
democratic
governor
signed
into
law
a
six-week
abortion
ban
in
may
edwards
said
on
his
radio
show
this
is
an
issue
i've
been
consistent
on
forever
i
am
pro-life
years
ago
the
governor
issued
an
executive
order
to
protect
lgbtq
state-government
workers
from
discrimination
but
the
louisiana
supreme
court
sided
with
attorney
general
jeff
landry
who
said
it
was
unconstitutional
in
addition
to
abraham's
opposition
to
lgbtq
rights
and
abortion
access
the
congressman
has
also
made
racist
comments
to
express
his
support
for
trump
the
president
suggested
that
four
democratic
congresswomen
of
color
to
go
back
and
help
fix
the
totally
broken
and
crime
infested
places
from
which
they
came
instead
of
telling
people
how
our
government
is
to
be
run
abraham
tweeted
that
he
would
pay
for
their
tickets
out
of
the
country
he
called
them
un-american
all
four
are
american
citizens
and
three
were
born
in
the
u.s.
