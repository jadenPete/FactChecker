hell
froze
over
and
donald
trump
called
out
white
supremacy
president
trump
at
long
last
has
uttered
the
term
making
it
harder
for
denialists
to
pretend
white
racism
doesn't
exist
as
hard
as
they
have
labored
to
avoid
it
conservative
americans
are
slowly
reluctantly
even
painfully
coming
to
grips
with
the
evil
wrought
by
the
racism
and
white
supremacy
infecting
our
country
some
of
us
have
long
warned
of
the
dangers
associated
with
the
rising
tide
of
armed
and
angry
white
men
who
feel
their
superior
place
in
american
society
is
imperiled
by
an
increasingly
multicultural
nation
for
the
most
part
conservative
policymakers
and
right-wing
pundits
have
ignored
the
obvious
turning
a
wilfully
blind
eye
to
the
threat
that
white
supremacists
pose
to
all
of
our
freedoms
those
who
point
out
racial
hypocrisy
and
the
disparately
unfair
treatment
of
people
of
color
are
often
accused
of
engaging
in
some
gas-lit
version
of
reverse
racism
but
embracing
such
a
view
requires
a
mass
disregard
of
racial
disparities
such
as
those
found
in
law
enforcement
and
which
contributed
to
the
founding
of
the
black
lives
matter
movement
anti-racism
activism
sprang
up
in
response
to
the
legitimate
community
outrage
over
police
killings
of
michael
brown
in
ferguson
eric
garner
in
new
york
city
tamir
rice
in
cleveland
and
freddie
gray
in
baltimore
among
many
others
a
modest
crack
in
the
wall
of
denialism
appeared
on
monday
when
president
trump
called
out
racist
hate
and
condemned
white
supremacy
in
remarks
to
a
still-grieving
nation
following
a
weekend
of
deadly
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
trump
used
those
loaded
terms
in
connection
with
the
gunman
in
the
texas
shooting
who
held
demonstrably
vile
racist
and
anti-immigrant
attitudes
the
shooter
in
el
paso
posted
a
manifesto
online
consumed
with
racist
hate
the
president
said
in
remarks
from
the
diplomatic
room
of
the
white
house
in
one
voice
our
nation
must
condemn
bigotry
hatred
and
white
supremacy
these
sinister
ideologies
must
be
defeated
trump's
condemnation
no
doubt
rings
hollow
to
many
of
his
critics
myself
included
since
he
foments
racial
resentment
with
his
own
divisive
and
intolerant
rhetoric
targeting
non-white
migrants
immigrants
and
racial
minorities
as
scapegoats
for
the
nation's
great
challenges
this
could
be
clearly
seen
in
the
days
immediately
preceding
last
weekend's
deadly
shootings
when
trump
let
loose
a
fusillade
of
racist
tweets
disparaging
the
predominately
black
city
of
baltimore
and
maryland
rep
elijah
cummings
an
influential
democrat
who
represents
the
city
and
is
chair
of
a
key
house
committee
that's
investigating
him
before
attacking
cummings
trump
directed
a
string
of
racist
comments
at
four
house
democratic
women
of
color
who
had
protested
against
white
house
polices
on
migrant
detention
camps
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
as
vox's
p.r.
lockhart
recently
noted
trump
traffics
in
racist
tropes
to
signal
his
solidarity
with
white
supremacists
who
are
unfailingly
loyal
to
him
the
president's
use
of
stereotypes
when
speaking
about
black
communities
and
communities
of
color
attacks
that
he
doesn't
use
on
poor
white
communities
affected
by
the
opioid
crisis
or
predominantly
white
regions
struggling
economically
have
been
well-documented
with
places
like
baltimore
chicago
oakland
and
ferguson
being
presented
as
uniquely
violent
and
dangerous
and
therefore
unworthy
of
trump's
support
or
protection
lockhart
wrote
the
impact
of
trump's
use
of
racist
language
as
a
political
shield
is
manifest
consider
for
example
the
former
fbi
counterterrorism
agent
who
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
washington
post
that
the
nation's
law
enforcement
agencies
are
reluctant
to
investigate
aggressively
white
nationalist
extremists
fearing
they
might
upset
the
white
house
for
appearing
to
attack
trump's
base
of
supporters
there's
some
reluctance
among
agents
to
bring
forth
an
investigation
that
targets
what
the
president
perceives
as
his
base
dave
gomez
a
former
fbi
agent
told
the
newspaper
fbi
director
christopher
wray
is
an
honorable
man
but
i
think
in
many
ways
the
fbi
is
hamstrung
in
trying
to
investigate
the
white
supremacist
movement
like
the
old
fbi
would
it's
a
no-win
situation
for
the
fbi
agent
or
supervisor
but
the
truth
can't
be
overlooked
forever
and
signs
of
changing
attitudes
are
beginning
to
break
through
sen
ted
cruz
a
republican
from
texas
called
the
el
paso
shooting
a
heinous
act
of
terrorism
and
white
supremacy
his
comments
proceeded
the
president's
and
represented
something
of
an
early
independent
break
from
his
typical
lockstep
embrace
of
whatever
trump
says
or
does
the
right-leaning
washington
examiner
posted
an
online
editorial
monday
in
advance
of
the
president's
remarks
urging
trump
to
use
the
bully
pulpit
to
become
a
leading
crusader
against
white
nationalism
and
racism
some
conservatives
and
republicans
have
hesitated
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
growing
scourge
but
after
el
paso
any
such
reluctance
is
unacceptable
trump
needs
to
make
clear
that
he
hates
white
nationalism
as
something
un-american
and
evil
did
these
few
lonely
voices
from
among
his
staunch
supporters
persuade
trump
to
utter
the
words
white
supremacy
which
so
many
in
his
ranks
have
denied
even
exists
or
could
there
be
another
reason
the
atlantic's
ronald
brownstein
said
trump's
racism
is
beginning
to
cause
blowback
on
his
standing
among
some
white
supporters
specifically
brownstein
wrote
recently
that
polling
throughout
trump's
presidency
has
indicated
that
his
belligerent
and
divisive
style
raises
more
concern
among
women
voters
than
men
in
one
of
his
most
important
cohorts
the
white
working
class
while
it's
far
from
a
tipping
point
in
the
nation's
struggle
against
racism
the
fact
that
trump
felt
enough
pressure
amid
the
nation's
grief
over
the
texas
and
ohio
shootings
to
condemn
white
superiority
represents
something
of
a
historic
moment
worth
marking
maybe
just
maybe
it
will
signal
the
beginning
of
a
change
in
attitude
among
conservative
americans
who
have
been
blind
and
deaf
to
the
creeping
dangers
of
white
supremacists
in
their
midst
