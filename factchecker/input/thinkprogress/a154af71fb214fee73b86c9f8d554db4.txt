puerto
rico
gets
third
governor
in
a
week
braces
for
more
turmoil
wanda
v
zquez
might
not
last
long
in
the
job
either
after
a
third
governor
took
office
within
just
one
week's
time
puerto
rico
remained
on
edge
thursday
bracing
for
more
political
churn
and
possible
protests
wanda
v
zquez
who
had
been
the
justice
secretary
was
sworn
in
wednesday
despite
initially
saying
she
was
not
interested
in
the
post
her
policies
are
seen
as
being
the
same
as
those
of
former
gov
ricardo
rossell
who
was
forced
to
resign
after
weeks
of
protests
on
the
island
of
million
people
the
man
rossell
had
chosen
as
his
successor
pedro
pierluis
was
disqualified
when
puerto
rico's
highest
court
decided
unanimously
that
he
had
been
placed
in
the
job
unconstitutionally
without
senate
confirmation
we
have
all
felt
the
anxiety
provoked
by
the
instability
and
uncertainty
faced
with
this
enormous
challenge
and
with
god
ahead
i
take
a
step
forward
with
no
interest
other
than
serving
the
people
as
i
have
done
my
whole
life
v
zquez
said
wednesday
night
in
a
televised
statement
v
zquez
might
not
last
long
in
the
position
as
some
key
players
including
senate
president
thomas
rivera
schatz
have
already
declared
their
support
for
others
to
fill
the
role
v
zquez
would
have
to
resign
if
another
candidate
is
nominated
and
then
confirmed
it
is
estimated
that
roughly
a
third
of
puerto
rico's
population
turned
out
in
protest
after
corruption
charges
were
leveled
against
two
former
members
of
rossell
s
administration
messages
between
rossell
and
members
of
his
inner
circle
mocking
women
gays
victims
of
hurricane
maria
and
others
contributed
to
public
ire
hurricane
maria
devastated
the
island
in
september
already
an
economically-struggling
u.s.
territory
puerto
rico
was
plunged
into
chaos
as
massive
swaths
of
the
island
dealt
with
water
and
power
shortages
for
months
after
the
hurricane
the
former
administration
officials
were
arrested
in
july
on
charges
of
paying
unqualified
contractors
favored
for
political
reasons
with
federal
funds
v
zquez
has
her
share
of
critics
her
detractors
say
that
as
justice
secretary
she
failed
to
pursue
those
who
mismanaged
funds
intended
for
hurricane
relief
and
looked
the
other
way
when
she
should
have
been
pursuing
corruption
investigations
against
officials
she
knows
how
precarious
her
position
is
and
in
her
address
wednesday
night
told
puerto
ricans
that
she's
aware
she
was
not
chosen
by
the
people
for
this
position
but
i
came
from
those
same
people
i
am
a
product
of
public
schools
i
know
what
it
is
to
come
from
nothing
i
know
what
hard
work
is
she
added
late
last
year
puerto
rico's
office
of
government
ethics
received
a
complaint
accusing
v
zquez
of
ethics
violations
although
in
december
a
judge
ruled
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
against
her
protesters
took
to
the
streets
last
week
when
they
heard
v
zquez
was
being
considered
for
the
position
