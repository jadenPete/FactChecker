ice
raids
followed
a
massive
sexual
harassment
settlement
at
mississippi
plants
the
raids
could
discourage
future
complaints
of
worker
abuse
wednesday's
raid
by
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
which
led
to
nearly
workers
being
detained
targeted
seven
koch
foods
inc
poultry
plants
in
morton
mississippi
as
it
happens
last
year
koch
foods
settled
a
million
lawsuit
for
racial
discrimination
national
origin
discrimination
and
sexual
harassment
against
its
latinx
workers
in
that
very
same
morton
facility
according
to
the
suit
brought
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
supervisors
touched
and
or
made
sexually
suggestive
comments
to
female
hispanic
employees
hit
hispanic
employees
and
charged
many
of
them
money
for
normal
everyday
work
activities
many
workers
were
reportedly
either
discharged
or
subjected
to
other
forms
of
retaliation
when
they
complained
as
part
of
the
settlement
koch
foods
not
only
paid
out
a
massive
sum
to
the
victims
but
also
agreed
to
implement
training
for
employees
and
set
up
a
hour
hotline
for
reporting
discrimination
complaints
in
both
english
and
spanish
the
settlement
lasted
three
years
which
means
koch
foods
is
still
under
supervision
to
continue
efforts
to
reduce
discrimination
in
its
work
place
as
labor
reporter
mike
elk
notes
at
payday
report
it
may
not
be
a
coincidence
that
the
morton
plant
was
raided
there
have
been
at
least
two
other
plants
one
in
salem
ohio
and
another
in
morristown
tennessee
where
ice
raids
have
followed
complaints
of
worker
conditions
last
year
for
example
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
osha
fined
fresh
mark
over
for
three
separate
incidents
in
which
proper
safety
guards
were
not
in
place
in
its
salem
meatpacking
plant
a
week
later
it
was
raided
by
ice
the
united
food
and
commercial
workers
union
ufcw
which
represents
many
of
these
plant
workers
is
concerned
these
ice
raids
will
discourage
workers
from
reporting
abuse
or
unsafe
conditions
this
means
employers
like
koch
foods
can
rely
on
the
fear
of
raids
to
help
them
exploit
migrant
laborers
already
working
in
dangerous
facilities
without
accountability
for
their
other
illicit
labor
conditions
wednesday's
raid
was
one
of
the
biggest
ice
raids
in
over
a
decade
it
took
place
on
the
first
day
of
school
in
morton
meaning
many
children
whose
parents
were
detained
had
no
family
to
go
home
to
at
the
end
of
the
day
