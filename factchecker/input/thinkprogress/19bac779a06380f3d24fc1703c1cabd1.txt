blagojevich
tried
to
sell
a
us
senate
seat
trump
said
most
politicians
have
done
worse
president
donald
trump
says
he
is
very
strongly
leaning
toward
commuting
the
sentence
of
convicted
felon
and
former
celebrity
apprentice
contestant
rod
blagojevich
though
the
former
illinois
governor
was
removed
from
office
and
convicted
of
numerous
federal
corruption
charges
for
trying
to
illegally
sell
an
appointment
to
a
vacant
united
states
senate
seat
trump
minimized
his
crimes
as
mere
braggadocio
no
worse
than
most
other
public
officials
and
said
he
liked
blagojevich's
wife
trump
made
the
comment
to
reporters
on
wednesday
as
he
began
his
return
trip
to
washington
following
his
day
of
bringing
unity
to
the
country
by
attacking
his
critics
on
a
trip
ostensibly
meant
to
console
victims
of
two
mass
shootings
i
thought
he
was
treated
unbelievably
unfairly
trump
said
of
his
season
three
celebrity
apprentice
hopeful
he's
been
in
jail
for
seven
years
over
a
phone
call
where
nothing
happens
over
a
phone
call
which
he
shouldn't
have
said
what
he
said
but
it
was
braggadocio
you
would
say
the
president
added
i
would
think
that
there
have
been
many
politicians
i'm
not
one
of
them
by
the
way
that
have
said
a
lot
worse
over
the
telephone
this
is
a
gross
oversimplification
blagojevich
was
convicted
of
public
corruption
counts
in
including
wire
fraud
extortion
and
bribery
beyond
the
famous
phone
conversation
in
which
he
boasted
that
the
opportunity
to
appoint
an
interim
senator
was
fucking
golden
and
that
he
was
just
not
giving
it
up
for
fucking
nothing
he
was
also
accused
of
demanding
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
campaign
donations
by
a
politician
had
who
wanted
the
seat
an
appeals
court
upheld
his
conviction
on
most
of
those
counts
in
while
overturning
some
trump
also
praised
patti
blagojevich
saying
his
wife
i
think
is
fantastic
while
the
former
illinois
first
lady
was
not
charged
prosecutors
did
reportedly
note
in
their
indictment
of
her
husband
that
she
received
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
little-
or
no-work
real
estate
deals
they
also
alleged
that
she
was
captured
in
telephone
calls
shouting
obscenities
and
urging
that
the
chicago
tribune
fire
editorial
writers
in
exchange
for
state
assistance
after
blagojevich
was
removed
from
office
but
before
he
was
convicted
trump
made
him
a
contestant
on
the
spring
season
of
his
reality
show
alongside
professional
wrestler
bill
goldberg
former
baseball
star
darryl
strawberry
tv
personality
sharon
osbourne
and
stand-up
comedian
sinbad
at
the
time
blagojevich
maintained
his
innocence
you're
doing
wonderfully
everything's
great
but
you
keep
losing
and
you're
running
out
of
people
you're
the
project
manager
trump
scolded
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
episode
of
the
season
and
governor
i
have
great
respect
for
you
i
have
great
respect
for
your
tenacity
for
the
fact
that
you
just
don't
give
up
but
rod
you're
fired
the
new
york
times
reported
on
thursday
that
trump's
son-in-law
and
senior
adviser
jared
kushner
had
suggested
mr
blagojevich
be
pardoned
saying
that
it
would
appeal
to
democrats
but
that
they
decided
on
commutation
fearing
the
political
optics
of
a
full
pardon
trump
first
suggested
he
might
free
blagojevich
back
in
may
but
has
thus
far
not
acted
he
has
previously
used
his
pardon
and
commutation
powers
to
help
far-right
conspiracy
theorist
dinesh
d'souza
former
vice
president
dick
cheney
aide
i.
lewis
scooter
libby
and
the
disgraced
former
sheriff
of
maricopa
county
arizona
joe
arpaio
this
post
has
been
updated
to
note
that
an
appeals
court
tossed
some
of
blagojevich's
conviction
counts
on
appeal
