nra
goes
after
anti-gun
rich
people
in
response
to
latest
mass
shooting
ceo
wayne
lapierre
who
demanded
the
group
buy
him
a
multi-million
dollar
compound
attacks
the
billion
dollar
media
machine
each
horrible
act
can't
become
an
ax
for
opportunists
to
cleave
the
very
bill
of
rights
that
binds
us
those
were
the
words
of
the
national
rifle
association's
nra
president
just
days
after
a
mass
shooting
left
the
country
reeling
and
mourning
the
year
was
and
charlton
heston
was
plowing
ahead
with
an
nra
convention
in
denver
colorado
mere
miles
from
columbine
high
school
where
victims
were
shot
and
killed
by
two
armed
gunmen
now
consider
the
words
of
current
nra
ceo
wayne
lapierre
this
week
days
after
multiple
mass
shootings
in
texas
ohio
and
california
left
the
country
once
again
reeling
and
mourning
there's
nothing
about
an
insane
criminal
committing
a
horrible
act
that
should
lead
to
the
government
taking
guns
away
from
law
abiding
citizens
with
his
statement
lapierre
plowed
ahead
with
the
nra's
mission
of
resisting
any
effort
to
curb
gun
violence
in
the
country
even
after
more
people
were
buried
with
bullet
holes
in
their
bodies
not
much
has
changed
in
the
two
decades
separating
those
two
quotes
republican
lawmakers
continue
to
block
any
effort
to
impose
even
the
most
simplistic
regulations
on
guns
the
nra
continues
to
fundraise
off
the
murder
of
children
and
the
american
people
continue
to
support
common
sense
gun
control
measures
by
overwhelming
majorities
just
about
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
in
the
gun
debate
in
the
last
years
is
the
frequency
and
body
count
of
mass
shootings
both
of
which
have
climbed
significantly
but
there's
one
other
similarity
between
and
today
the
nra's
favorability
numbers
are
way
down
in
shortly
after
columbine
just
of
the
country
had
a
favorable
view
of
the
gun
group
after
years
of
successful
image
rehabilitation
the
nra's
numbers
have
cratered
once
again
with
a
fox
news
poll
this
week
finding
that
just
of
americans
view
the
nra
favorably
the
nra
itself
is
no
doubt
keenly
aware
of
those
numbers
and
of
the
public's
perception
of
them
at
the
moment
that's
why
lapierre
filmed
what
amounts
to
a
campaign
ad
in
recent
days
decrying
the
real
victim
of
the
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
the
nra
speaking
directly
into
the
camera
in
a
video
posted
to
youtube
and
twitter
earlier
this
week
lapierre
reserved
the
bulk
of
his
criticism
not
for
the
gunmen
in
the
recent
shootings
but
for
the
highly
orchestrated
effort
to
disarm
american
citizens
unlike
anything
we've
ever
seen
in
this
country
it's
an
effort
to
destroy
the
nra
to
defame
our
millions
of
members
and
tens
of
millions
of
supporters
an
effort
that's
fueled
by
billionaires
and
a
multi-billion
dollar
media
machine
that
couldn't
care
less
about
fighting
crime
said
the
ceo
who
demanded
the
organization
buy
him
a
multi-million
dollar
compound
in
texas
after
the
parkland
shooting
supposedly
for
safety
reasons
the
nra
has
demonstrated
in
recent
months
that
it
needs
no
outside
help
in
destroying
the
organization
internal
quarreling
reportedly
led
to
the
messy
ouster
of
former
president
oliver
north
and
accusations
of
financial
mismanagement
were
aired
publicly
internal
documents
revealed
the
nra
to
be
hemorrhaging
money
and
earlier
this
year
it
shuttered
nra
tv
the
organization's
online
channel
which
was
frequently
used
to
promote
pro-gun
propaganda
more
recently
four
nra
board
members
announced
their
resignations
from
the
organization
in
a
two
week
span
and
other
notable
conservatives
publicly
rebuked
the
organization
and
canceled
their
memberships
that
fox
news
poll
the
one
that
showed
the
nra
with
its
lowest
favorability
numbers
ever
also
captured
one
other
troubling
statistic
for
the
organization
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
nra's
unfavorable
numbers
were
higher
than
its
favorable
ones
