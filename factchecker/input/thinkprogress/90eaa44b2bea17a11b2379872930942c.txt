hud's
plan
to
remove
shelter
protections
for
transgender
people
would
be
devastating
this
would
encourage
shelters
to
essentially
discriminate
against
homeless
trans
people
who
need
a
place
to
rest
the
u.s.
department
of
housing
and
urban
development's
hud
regulatory
agenda
this
fall
includes
a
new
rule
which
says
shelters
that
receive
manage
or
operate
hud
grants
can
essentially
ignore
nondiscrimination
protections
for
unhoused
trans
people
but
legal
experts
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
likely
to
be
challenged
an
analysis
published
this
week
from
the
center
for
american
progress
also
finds
no
evidence
of
any
demand
for
this
rule
from
shelters
and
that
hud
has
taken
strong
steps
to
formalize
lgbtq-exclusionary
practices
for
shelter
providers
in
other
ways
in
may
one
day
after
hud
secretary
ben
carson
told
rep
jennifer
wexton
that
he
wasn't
currently
anticipating
changing
the
equal
access
rule
hud
released
its
plans
to
scrap
housing
protections
for
trans
people

sasha
buchert
a
senior
attorney
with
lambda
legal
an
organization
dedicated
to
advancing
the
civil
rights
of
lgbtq
people
and
people
living
with
hiv
said
it's
possible
that
lambda
legal
and
other
civil
rights
organizations
would
file
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
rule
this
is
patently
unconstitutional
and
discriminatory
on
its
face
and
it
would
shock
me
if
we
did
not
bring
a
lawsuit
buchert
said
the
rule
would
also
put
trans
people
in
the
impossible
situation
of
having
to
choose
whether
to
stay
in
a
space
within
a
shelter
that
is
inconsistent
with
their
gender
or
not
stay
in
a
shelter
at
all
the
u.s.
transgender
survey
found
that
nearly
one
in
three
trans
respondents
said
they
had
experienced
homelessness
this
would
be
absolutely
devastating
in
the
sense
that
it
would
send
a
message
to
shelter
providers
that
they
can
turn
away
trans
people
with
impunity
they're
wrong
the
law
is
the
law
and
the
federal
housing
title
viii
of
the
civil
rights
act
prohibits
discrimination
based
on
sex
and
that
would
encompass
gender
identity
they're
still
going
to
be
liable
she
said
forcing
trans
people
into
this
impossible
choice
to
sleep
out
on
the
street
or
go
stay
in
a
facility
inconsistent
with
their
gender
identity
is
extremely
harmful
and
there's
no
evidence
that
there
has
been
any
concerns
with
implementation
of
that
across
the
board
across
the
u.s.
all
that
has
happened
is
that
trans
people
specifically
have
been
able
to
find
safe
shelter
buchert
added
a
notice
of
the
proposed
rule
change
says
those
shelters
permitting
single-sex
or
sex-segregated
facilities
can
establish
a
policy
by
which
such
shelter
provider
considers
an
individual's
sex
for
the
purposes
of
determining
accommodation
within
such
shelters
and
for
purposes
of
determining
sex
for
admission
to
any
facility
or
portion
thereof
the
shelters
can
consider
a
range
of
factors
hud
explains
including
privacy
safety
practical
concerns
religious
beliefs
any
relevant
considerations
under
civil
rights
and
nondiscrimination
authorities
hud
said
sex
can
be
reflected
in
government
documents
as
well
as
the
gender
the
person
identifies
with
but
it
does
not
dictate
a
required
basis
for
making
determinations
other
than
that
they
be
consistent
with
an
overall
policy
in
effect
this
means
hud
is
trying
to
take
the
strong
protections
established
in
and
and
undermine
them
into
unenforceable
guidance
that
will
leave
many
vulnerable
trans
people
on
the
street
shelter
providers
can
simply
claim
that
their
policies
are
consistent
with
local
and
state
law
and
the
shelter
provider's
overall
policy
in
hud
implemented
a
final
rule
referred
to
as
the
equal
access
rule
to
ensure
that
its
core
programs
are
open
to
all
eligible
individuals
and
families
regardless
of
sexual
orientation
gender
identity
or
marital
status
in
hud
issued
a
subsequent
rule
that
clarified
that
sex-segregated
shelters
receiving
funding
must
also
adhere
to
the
equal
access
rule
buchert
said
that
these
requirements
on
proving
one's
gender
simply
don't
adhere
to
how
nondiscrimination
protections
are
actually
understood
under
the
law
she
asked
for
instance
whether
someone
seeking
shelter
would
have
to
prove
how
often
they
attended
church
in
order
to
prove
someone
is
protected
by
religious
nondiscrimination
laws
they
say
others
can
define
sex
in
whatever
way
they
want
to
by
basically
looking
at
a
number
of
different
factors
and
just
look
to
birth
certificates
government
documents
whether
they
identify
as
and
existing
state
law
and
privacy
issues
just
this
whole
basically
balancing
test
of
some
kind
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
law
understands
gender
identity
buchert
said
when
people
are
discriminated
against
they
should
be
looking
at
the
decision-making
process
of
the
person
doing
the
discriminating
she
continued
it
shouldn't
even
matter
whether
the
person
is
actually
transgender
if
someone
sees
someone
as
transgender
and
discriminates
against
them
it's
the
ill
intent
of
the
person
doing
the
discriminating
that
is
at
fault
here
that
kind
of
analysis
doesn't
apply
in
regard
to
how
agencies
enforce
the
law
other
than
political
motivations
it
isn't
clear
what
has
motivated
hud
to
act
on
this
issue
according
to
a
center
for
american
progress
column
on
the
proposed
rule
hud
has
moved
forward
with
this
rulemaking
despite
a
lack
of
outcry
from
shelters
about
the
implementation
of
the
rule
and
the
clarification
the
column
also
highlights
how
hud
has
attempted
to
undermine
the
equal
access
rule
by
removing
points
awarded
to
applicants
for
partnering
with
lgbtq-serving
organizations
and
for
applicants
that
decided
to
do
trainings
on
implementing
the
and
rules
hud
also
removed
any
mention
of
lgbtq
people
from
its
continuum
of
care
program
notice
and
funding
availability
in
that
notice
it
failed
to
include
the
equal
access
rule
in
its
list
of
required
nondiscrimination
policies
