agriculture's
role
in
climate
change
draws
scrutiny
from
democrats
the
ipcc
report
singled
out
land
use
some
presidential
contenders
are
making
it
an
electoral
issue
democratic
presidential
contenders
are
increasingly
singling
out
agriculture
as
the
next
great
frontier
for
climate
action
pushing
plans
that
would
empower
rural
and
farming
communities
while
addressing
the
sector's
contributions
to
greenhouse
gas
emissions
that
trend
represents
a
mounting
scientific
consensus
that
any
effective
efforts
to
counter
global
warming
will
need
to
involve
overhauling
land
use
which
accounts
for
almost
a
quarter
of
emissions
globally
it
also
comes
two
weeks
after
the
u.n.
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
released
a
sweeping
report
highlighting
the
extent
to
which
agriculture
and
other
forms
of
land
use
are
contributing
to
climate
change
on
wednesday
gov
jay
inslee
d-wa
became
the
latest
democratic
presidential
hopeful
to
home
in
on
the
connection
between
agriculture
and
global
warming
inslee
who
has
devoted
his
entire
campaign
to
climate
action
rolled
out
a
growing
rural
prosperity
initiative
the
sixth
major
climate-oriented
plan
from
the
governor
the
plan
will
reinvigorate
america's
rural
and
farming
communities
while
empowering
farmers
to
benefit
from
enormous
economic
opportunities
as
we
build
america's
clean
economy
and
work
to
defeat
climate
change
inslee
said
in
a
statement
under
the
new
proposal
farmers
would
play
a
key
role
in
combatting
climate
change
a
government-funded
carbon
farming
initiative
would
pay
farmers
for
their
efforts
to
remove
carbon
emissions
from
the
atmosphere
as
well
as
methane
reduction
projects
inslee
would
also
launch
a
new
advanced
research
projects
agency
agriculture
arpa-ag
to
work
on
innovation
in
the
sector
along
with
boosting
biofuel
efforts
nationally
the
plan
is
framed
as
a
boon
to
rural
communities
and
inslee
pledges
to
revitalize
rural
economies
through
an
expansion
of
renewable
energy
coupled
with
an
expansion
of
rural
broadband
connectivity
the
proposal
moreover
would
strengthen
protections
for
farmworkers
who
are
already
suffering
the
impacts
of
climate
change
studies
show
inslee
would
also
support
new
diverse
women
and
young
farmers
in
their
efforts
to
establish
careers
additionally
the
plan
would
seek
to
improve
forest
health
and
public
lands
along
with
new
protections
for
indigenous
spaces
budgeting
for
the
conservation
stewardship
program
would
also
triple
under
inslee
bolstering
support
for
farmers
conserving
their
land
farmers
can't
afford
runaway
climate
change
and
america
can't
defeat
climate
change
without
the
help
of
farmers
my
plan
will
grow
a
new
more
prosperous
and
sustainable
future
for
our
entire
nation
inslee
pledged
the
governor's
proposal
is
sweeping
in
scope
and
comes
at
a
moment
of
reckoning
for
agriculture
on
august
the
ipcc
rolled
out
a
lengthy
report
specifically
identifying
the
ways
in
which
land
use
is
contributing
to
global
warming
that
analysis
cites
food
production
as
a
key
point
of
concern
cattle
and
rice
fields
alone
generate
around
half
of
all
methane
emissions
while
farming
practices
more
broadly
contribute
to
soil
degradation
weakening
the
planet's
defense
against
rising
temperatures
those
findings
aren't
new
climate
scientists
have
singled
out
agriculture
for
years
as
a
leading
emissions
source
now
however
the
issue
is
gaining
political
traction
farmers
are
a
key
voting
demographic
in
states
like
iowa
where
the
presidential
caucus
will
be
important
for
white
house
hopefuls
historically
that
has
meant
candidates
shy
away
from
topics
that
could
cost
them
with
voters
like
overhauling
agriculture
but
with
climate
change
emerging
as
a
top
concern
for
voters
democratic
presidential
contenders
are
increasingly
identifying
land
use
and
agriculture
in
particular
as
a
policy
opportunity
in
addition
to
inslee
a
number
of
candidates
have
rolled
out
rural
policy
platforms
that
touch
on
farming
and
climate
change
in
an
unprecedented
break
from
prior
elections
insideclimate
news
reported
last
week
that
at
least
of
the
democratic
candidates
currently
running
for
president
have
made
statements
or
issued
policies
connecting
agriculture
to
global
warming
among
them
are
several
frontrunners
including
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-ma
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
many
of
the
contenders
have
also
endorsed
the
green
new
deal
a
blueprint
for
swiftly
shifting
the
united
states
to
net-zero
emissions
the
proposal
is
vague
but
asserts
that
a
change
in
farming
practices
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
its
end
goal
much
like
the
plans
proposed
by
candidates
like
inslee
the
green
new
deal
calls
for
a
partnership
between
farmers
and
the
government
to
cut
pollution
while
advancing
sustainable
practices
even
as
these
efforts
gain
momentum
they
are
facing
resistance
scientists
with
the
department
of
agriculture
usda
have
continued
to
produce
reports
underscoring
the
link
between
the
sector
and
global
warming
but
president
donald
trump's
administration
has
downplayed
the
impacts
of
climate
change
and
usda
researchers
say
their
work
is
being
stifled
meanwhile
two
usda
bureaus
are
undergoing
a
controversial
relocation
out
of
washington
d.c.
to
the
midwest
a
move
some
employees
worry
is
retaliation
for
the
department's
climate
research
