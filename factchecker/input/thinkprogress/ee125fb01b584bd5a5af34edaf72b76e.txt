eeoc
now
gives
nonbinary
people
a
way
to
be
counted
in
workplace
the
eeoc
quietly
acknowledged
nonbinary
workers
in
a
change
to
the
frequently
asked
questions
section
on
its
site
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
an
independent
federal
agency
that
is
responsible
for
enforcing
federal
civil
rights
laws
against
workplace
discrimination
recently
changed
its
website
to
address
how
employers
can
report
workers
as
nonbinary
before
the
eeoc's
actions
last
week
employers
didn't
have
a
way
to
report
nonbinary
workers
in
what
are
known
as
eeo-
reports
which
are
filed
with
the
agency
as
mandated
by
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
more
americans
are
informing
people
that
their
gender
is
under
the
nonbinary
umbrella
which
places
a
pressing
need
on
employers
to
recognize
their
gender
and
more
states
are
recognizing
this
diversity
according
to
a
harris
poll
done
on
behalf
of
glaad
in
of
millennials
say
they
are
transgender
agender
genderfluid
or
bigender
which
is
double
the
percentage
of
generation
x
who
said
the
same
the
report
said
there
were
growing
levels
of
young
people
whose
genders
are
outside
of
the
gender
binary
more
than
one
third
of
people
in
generation
z
say
they
know
someone
who
uses
non-binary
pronouns
such
as
they
and
them
a
few
states
allow
nonbinary
people
to
choose
a
marker
other
than
m
or
f
on
government
identification
such
as
driver's
licenses
and
id
cards
california
oregon
minnesota
colorado
maine
maryland
hawaii
and
the
district
of
columbia
allow
nonbinary
people
to
have
this
option
such
as
an
x
designation
washington
oregon
and
new
jersey
allow
nonbinary
birth
certificates
the
eeoc
has
recognized
this
need
under
its
frequently
asked
questions
page
addressing
and
compensation
data
according
to
the
national
law
review
these
changes
were
made
on
august
although
this
guidance
for
employers
is
not
a
long-term
solution
for
nonbinary
people
it
is
an
improvement
over
completely
erasing
nonbinary
people's
genders
it
also
defies
the
binary
understanding
of
gender
that
the
trump
administration
has
embraced
from
the
beginning
the
eeoc
directs
employers
to
write
the
nonbinary
worker's
gender
in
the
comment
box
on
the
certification
page
and
to
preface
it
with
additional
employee
data
the
eeoc
provides
an
example
harper
jean
tobin
director
of
policy
at
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
said
the
eeoc
was
likely
responding
to
employers
questions
about
how
to
account
for
nonbinary
workers
there
has
not
been
a
concern
that
something
bad
was
going
to
happen
to
employers
because
they
didn't
include
this
data
employers
wanted
to
know
how
to
provide
accurate
data
to
the
eeoc
so
the
eeoc
said
that's
fine
we're
not
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
defining
people's
gender
she
said
if
you
have
employees
who
are
nonbinary
you
can
use
the
narrative
comment
section
of
the
form
like
you
could
for
anything
else
that
doesn't
fit
into
the
boxes
they
give
you
to
report
a
number
of
nonbinary
employees
tobin
compared
this
case
of
acknowledging
nonbinary
workers
to
actions
at
the
u.s.
department
of
health
and
human
services
to
undo
protections
for
transgender
people
hhs
recently
rolled
out
a
proposal
that
would
quash
guidelines
that
are
part
of
the
aca
which
explicitly
includes
gender
identity
under
sex
discrimination
last
year
the
new
york
times
also
reported
on
an
hhs
memo
that
classified
sex
as
either
male
or
female
and
determined
at
birth
it
does
stand
in
contrast
to
the
position
u.s.
health
and
human
services
has
staked
out
in
its
recent
health
care
rule
which
is
a
position
contrary
to
medical
science
that
gender
is
immutably
determined
at
birth
and
that
there
are
only
two
genders
she
said
the
eeoc
is
recognizing
the
reality
that
employers
know
who
their
own
workforce
is
and
who
their
employees
are
because
they
work
with
them
every
day
whereas
hhs
is
simply
covering
its
eyes
and
saying
we
don't
see
nonbinary
people
they
don't
exist
that
is
part
of
a
broader
problem
in
the
hhs
proposal
and
its
approach
to
civil
rights
laws
denying
that
gender
identity
is
a
core
part
of
human
identity
that
gender
transition
is
often
medically
necessary
that
our
civil
rights
laws
have
long
been
understood
to
protect
transgender
people
from
discrimination
although
this
may
seem
like
a
small
tweak
it
matters
to
nonbinary
workers
to
be
counted
and
not
forced
to
choose
between
two
genders
when
neither
accurately
describes
them
this
action
can
also
be
understood
in
the
context
of
other
recent
actions
from
the
eeoc
last
week
the
justice
department
filed
a
court
brief
on
behalf
of
the
eeoc
to
argue
that
transgender
people
and
in
turn
other
people
affected
by
sex
stereotypes
are
not
protected
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
it
would
essentially
overturn
price
waterhouse
v
hopkins
in
the
eeoc
sued
for
alleged
discrimination
against
aimee
stephens
a
trans
woman
who
said
she
was
fired
because
she
informed
her
employer
that
she
was
a
woman
stephens
said
the
termination
violated
the
civil
rights
act
the
eeoc
won
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
the
u.s.
supreme
court
level
however
the
eeoc
has
to
be
represented
by
the
solicitor
general
who
can
say
the
opposite
of
what
the
eeoc
has
said
in
the
lower
courts
tobin
said
this
rarely
happens
but
has
occurred
twice
in
recent
months
although
the
general
counsel
for
an
agency
usually
signs
these
briefs
the
eeoc
did
not
the
national
law
journal
writes
that
this
may
be
evidence
that
the
eeoc
doesn't
agree
with
the
justice
department's
argument
it's
telling
that
lawyers
for
the
eeoc
weren't
willing
to
sign
their
names
to
the
brief
we've
had
many
cases
in
the
recent
past
where
justice
department
lawyers
were
not
willing
to
sign
their
names
to
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
the
administration
because
of
its
legal
arguments
and
this
may
be
another
such
case
tobin
said
in
this
case
it
also
happens
to
not
reflect
the
view
of
commission
in
the
way
that
day-to-day
it's
still
interpreting
and
enforcing
the
law
at
least
what
is
consistent
with
most
of
the
case
law
there
have
been
attempts
to
politicize
the
eeoc
members
of
the
commission
are
usually
reconfirmed
without
much
attention
but
in
sen
mike
lee
r-ut
objected
to
the
reappointment
of
chai
feldblum
who
is
a
lesbian
lee
said
she
had
radical
views
on
marriage
these
nominations
are
usually
passed
by
unanimous
consent
feldblum
later
withdrew
her
name
from
the
nomination
process
in
an
interview
with
hrdive
in
february
she
said
that
title
vii
protects
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
