rick
scott
boasts
of
post-parkland
gun
bill
says
it
was
about
solving
problems
there
have
been
at
least
mass
shootings
in
florida
since
then-gov
scott
signed
sb
sen
rick
scott
r-fl
a
proud
national
rifle
association
member
falsely
accused
congressional
democrats
this
week
of
acting
like
totalitarians
and
wanting
to
take
away
guns
from
law-abiding
citizens
in
the
wake
of
multiple
mass
shootings
across
the
country
he
then
pointed
to
a
law
he
signed
as
florida
governor
after
the
tragic
february
parkland
mass
school
shooting
suggesting
that
bill
had
been
about
finding
real
solutions
to
the
gun
violence
problem
but
scott's
vaunted
sb
has
hardly
solved
the
problem
in
florida
where
more
than
mass
shootings
have
happened
since
he
signed
the
legislation
scott
penned
an
op-ed
in
the
washington
post
on
friday
urging
red
flag
laws
to
temporarily
disarm
people
who
are
a
threat
to
themselves
and
others
in
it
he
made
the
seemingly
contradictory
claims
that
o
ne
thing
that
does
absolutely
nothing
to
help
is
the
almost
instantaneous
politicking
and
blame
games
that
follow
each
new
mass
shooting
and
that
d
epriving
americans
of
their
constitutional
right
to
bear
arms
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
many
on
the
left
who
exploit
tragedies
such
as
these
for
political
gain
on
monday
scott
joined
fox
news
to
reiterate
his
unfounded
claims
that
those
advocating
for
tougher
gun
laws
are
trying
to
disarm
all
americans
this
is
like
groundhog
day
we
have
a
shooting
and
the
democrats
want
to
take
away
your
guns
they
don't
want
to
solve
problems
they
want
to
take
away
your
guns
that's
what
totalitarian
governments
do
the
florida
republican
charged
he
then
boasted
that
after
the
mass
shootings
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
last
february
he
had
worked
effectively
to
solve
the
problems
of
school
safety
and
gun
violence
what
we
did
in
florida
was
after
parkland
happened
i
sat
down
within
four
or
five
days
i
got
law
enforcement
together
mental
health
counselors
together
and
i
got
educators
together
and
within
three
weeks
we
passed
logical
common
sense
legislation
to
make
our
schools
and
communities
safer
it
started
with
red
flag
laws
that
say
if
you're
threatening
harm
to
yourself
or
somebody
else
the
law
enforcement
can
go
to
the
court
system
and
through
due
process
all
weapons
can
be
taken
away
he
said
w
hat
we
did
scott
continued
in
contrast
with
what
democrats
are
doing
to
take
away
your
guns
we
said
what
will
solve
the
problem
so
we
ought
to
look
at
red
flag
laws
we
ought
to
look
at
everything
we
can
do
to
keep
these
communities
safer
because
you
would
hate
this
to
happen
to
your
family
or
any
family
your
heart
goes
out
to
the
families
that
lost
their
loved
ones
scott
dismissed
calls
by
some
to
reinstate
a
ban
on
the
sale
of
semi-automatic
assault
rifles
again
comparing
this
idea
to
what
totalitarian
governments
do
numerous
democratic
countries
including
australia
and
new
zealand
have
in
fact
banned
semi-automatic
weapons
scott's
suggestion
that
the
florida
legislation
was
about
finding
solutions
is
questionable
according
to
the
gun
violence
archive
there
have
been
mass
shootings
in
florida
since
scott
signed
his
law
last
march
resulting
in
deaths
and
injuries
though
most
recent
mass
shootings
have
been
carried
out
by
white
men
scott
also
seemed
to
suggest
on
monday
that
minority
youths
were
the
problem
criticizing
president
barack
obama
for
his
efforts
to
reduce
the
school-to-prison
pipeline
for
minority
students
scott
suggested
that
such
policies
were
the
driver
of
mass
shootings
obama
passed
this
promise
act
which
said
minority
students
would
not
be
stopped
and
referred
to
law
enforcement
he
charged
falsely
identifying
a
department
of
education
guidance
letter
as
a
non-existent
piece
of
legislation
scott
was
likely
thinking
of
the
youth
promise
act
a
legislative
proposal
to
help
youth
offenders
that
was
signed
into
law
by
president
donald
trump
in
december
he
added
this
stuff
makes
no
sense
let's
hold
people
accountable
let's
provide
more
law
enforcement
and
more
mental
health
