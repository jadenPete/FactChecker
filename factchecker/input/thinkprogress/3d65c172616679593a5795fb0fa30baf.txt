republican
senator
claims
that
buying
greenland
was
his
idea
after
running
as
a
deficit
hawk
tom
cotton
admits
he
was
behind
the
push
to
buy
greenland
once
upon
a
time
sen
tom
cotton
r-ar
talked
a
lot
about
balancing
the
budget
reducing
the
national
debt
and
eliminating
wasteful
spending
now
he
admits
he
was
behind
one
of
president
donald
trump's
most
comically
expensive
spending
ideas
buying
greenland
greenland
a
large
island
and
an
autonomous
portion
of
denmark
is
not
actually
for
sale
but
one
estimate
suggested
that
if
it
were
it
would
cost
around
half-a-trillion
dollars
to
purchase
that
is
roughly
the
same
amount
as
the
entire
federal
budget
deficit
in
the
final
year
of
president
barack
obama's
presidency
in
recent
days
trump
acknowledged
that
he
attempted
to
purchase
greenland
and
lashed
out
at
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
for
being
nasty
in
her
rebuff
a
term
he
frequently
uses
to
malign
powerful
women
who
do
not
give
him
his
way
but
on
wednesday
cotton
reportedly
boasted
that
buying
greenland
had
been
his
idea
all
along
speaking
at
the
talk
business
politics
power
lunch
at
the
red
blue
events
center
in
little
rock
the
arkansan
enthusiastically
backed
trump's
botched
attempt
to
spend
trillions
of
dollars
on
an
island
few
in
america
want
to
own
obviously
the
right
decision
for
this
country
cotton
said
you're
joking
but
i
can
reveal
to
you
that
several
months
ago
i
met
with
the
danish
ambassador
and
i
proposed
that
they
sell
greenland
to
us
noting
that
president
harry
truman
a
democrat
whose
spending
habits
were
not
popular
among
conservatives
once
tried
to
buy
greenland
for
million
cotton
told
the
attendees
that
its
economic
potential
is
untold
and
greenland
is
vital
to
our
national
security
anyone
who
can't
see
that
is
blinded
by
trump
derangement
he
claimed
i
told
the
president
you
should
buy
it
as
well
cotton
bragged
though
he
later
conceded
that
trump
had
also
heard
the
idea
from
some
other
people
as
well
cotton's
newfound
desire
to
buy
more
land
flies
in
the
face
of
his
obama-era
brand
as
a
fiscal
conservative
who
was
committed
to
balanced
budgets
and
deficit
reduction
in
he
signed
on
as
a
co-sponsor
of
a
proposed
constitutional
amendment
to
require
a
balanced
federal
budget
throughout
his
campaign
he
repeatedly
attacked
then-sen
mark
pryor
d-ar
and
obama
for
letting
the
deficit
and
debt
grow
during
his
time
in
the
house
cotton
frequently
complained
about
the
growing
national
debt
and
proposed
to
reduce
spending
to
bring
it
down
but
under
trump's
leadership
the
budget
deficit
has
swelled
to
more
than
a
trillion
dollars
annually
for
the
first
time
in
history
much
of
this
was
fueled
by
trump's
tax
cuts
for
the
rich
and
corporations
which
significantly
reduced
the
nation's
revenue
and
passed
with
cotton's
support
in
cotton
scolded
his
colleagues
saying
arkansans
learn
from
an
early
age
that
you
can't
spend
more
than
you
take
in
and
as
deeply
patriotic
people
we
also
learn
the
importance
of
supporting
our
military
rest
assured
i
am
committed
to
teaching
my
fellow
lawmakers
in
washington
these
same
lessons
and
without
a
hint
of
irony
he
pushed
a
bill
to
prohibit
bailouts
for
american
states
and
cities
last
month
claiming
the
reckless
debt-fueled
spending
of
a
few
state
and
local
governments
can't
go
on
forever
so
it
won't
our
bill
would
ensure
american
taxpayers
aren't
stuck
with
the
tab
for
the
spending
binges
of
a
few
irresponsible
politicians
