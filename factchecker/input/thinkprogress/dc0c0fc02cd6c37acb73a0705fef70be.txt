than

alabama
gov
kay
ivey
r
performed
a
comedic
skit
in
blackface
in
at
auburn
university
audio
tapes
circling
the
web
on
thursday
reveal
she
had
on
a
pair
of
blue
coveralls
and
she
had
put
some
black
paint
all
over
her
face
ben
laravia
then
ivey's
fianc
says
in
the
interview
we
were
acting
out
this
skit
called
cigar
butts
i
cannot
go
into
a
lengthy
explanation
but
to
say
the
least
i
think
this
skit
it
did
not
require
a
lot
of
talent
as
far
as
verbal
talent
the
performance
he
describes
in
the
interview
appears
consistent
with
the
ugliest
core
patterns
of
minstrel
show
tradition
a
white
audience
invited
to
hoot
with
laughter
at
a
portrayal
of
black
people
as
groveling
graceless
inferior
beings
ivey's
blackface
role
involved
crawling
around
on
the
floor
looking
for
cigar
butts
and
certainly
got
a
big
reaction
out
of
the
audience
her
then-fianc
said
in
the
interview
laravia
chuckles
as
he
recalls
the
evening
ivey
responds
with
a
story
about
forgetting
her
lines
later
on
in
the
evening's
performance
chuckling
as
well
but
not
saying
anything
further
about
her
blackface
role
the
date
of
the
pageant
in
question
is
particularly
significant
the
school
year
would
have
been
the
first
time
in
a
while
that
auburn
kids
didn't
have
to
wonder
if
a
black
student
might
see
or
hear
what
they
had
to
say
the
first
black
person
to
matriculate
at
the
school
harold
franklin
had
left
auburn
in
i
got
tired
of
the
crap
he
told
al
com
in
a
interview
saying
the
faculty
seemed
to
block
his
preferred
routes
of
study
at
every
turn
franklin's
enrollment
in
january
followed
two
separate
court
cases
overturning
the
white
establishment's
attempts
to
keep
black
people
out
of
the
school
the
interview
tape
comes
six
months
after
ivey
narrowly
avoided
the
kind
of
scandalous
re-examination
of
her
moral
character
that
faced
virginia
gov
ralph
northam
d
in
the
winter
photographs
showing
members
of
ivey's
sorority
in
blackface
emerged
in
february
during
a
nationwide
wave
of
such
reveals
sparked
by
northam's
own
offensive
past
behavior
and
stubborn
response
to
the
criticism
it
unleashed
opinions
about
the
virginia
governor
deeply
divided
the
state
the
gap
appeared
more
connected
to
generational
than
racial
lines
as
thinkprogress
reported
based
on
a
visit
to
northam's
remote
eastern
shore
home
town
reaction
among
alabama
politicians
to
ivey's
blackface
past
echo
those
that
came
in
virginia
after
northam's
pictures
were
revealed
and
like
her
democratic
counterpart
ivey
does
not
appear
interested
in
any
discussion
of
whether
or
not
she
can
be
trusted
to
lead
her
state
in
the
best
interests
of
its
black
residents
one
notable
difference
however
is
that
northam
eventually
appeared
before
reporters
and
cameras
to
talk
about
the
whole
affair
ivey
perhaps
aware
that
northam
nearly
broke
into
a
moonwalk
in
his
fervor
to
reject
the
idea
that
blackface
is
a
marker
of
racist
personal
prejudices
has
opted
for
a
written
statement
instead
it
is
a
striking
document
by
turns
conciliatory
and
minimizing
of
her
responsibility
throughout
she
is
adamant
that
she
is
no
longer
the
sort
of
person
who
would
shoe-polish
her
face
to
help
college
kids
laugh
at
a
perverse
denigration
of
black
people
while
some
may
attempt
to
excuse
this
as
acceptable
behavior
for
a
college
student
during
the
mid-
s
that
is
not
who
i
am
today
and
it
is
not
what
my
administration
represents
all
these
years
later
she
wrote
that
portion
of
the
statement
engages
a
slippery
rhetorical
technique
placing
a
defense
of
her
character
in
the
hypothetical
voice
of
some
imagined
other
then
moving
swiftly
on
having
neither
agreed
with
nor
condemned
that
argument
in
her
own
voice
state
rep
mike
ball
r
was
happier
to
take
up
the
some-may-say
invitation
ivey
coded
into
her
typed
statement
people
do
stupid
things
when
they
are
young
ball
told
reporters
thursday
one
of
the
wonderful
things
about
life
is
that
we
can
learn
and
we
can
change
over
time
the
governor's
written
statement
went
on
to
offer
heartfelt
apologies
and
a
pledge
to
do
all
i
can
going
forward
to
help
show
the
nation
that
the
alabama
of
today
is
a
far
cry
from
the
alabama
of
the
s
multiple
state
legislators
condemned
ivey
on
thursday
this
is
who
she
was
then
it
is
who
she
is
now
i
have
nothing
for
her
i
don't
accept
her
apology
state
rep
juandalynn
givan
d
said
givan
gave
special
attention
to
ivey's
decision
to
release
a
written
statement
without
facing
cameras
or
supporters
while
also
succinctly
capturing
the
kinds
of
questions
the
governor
likely
sought
to
avoid
fielding
under
klieg
lights
she
should
have
stood
before
the
people
of
alabama
herself
givan
said
just
as
she
stood
there
in
blackface
how
many
times
has
she
said
n
i'm
going
to
say
the
word
that
is
the
question
black
folk
need
to
ask
themselves
today
