responsibility
for
mounting
civilian
casualties
in
afghanistan
pinned
on
u.s.
backed
forces
u.n.
says
u.s.
and
afghan
forces
have
killed
more
civilians
than
the
taliban
have
this
year
kabul
afghanistan
last
week
the
united
nations
released
its
second
report
this
year
on
civilian
casualties
in
the
ongoing
war
in
afghanistan
though
the
report
found
that
armed
opposition
groups
like
the
taliban
and
isis
were
responsible
overall
for
the
highest
number
of
civilian
casualties
including
deaths
and
injuries
the
afghan
government
and
its
allies
were
nevertheless
responsible
for
the
majority
of
civilian
deaths
between
jan
and
june
the
figure
that
should
raise
the
most
alarm
in
washington
and
especially
at
the
cia
is
the
report's
conclusion
that
of
the
civilian
casualties
caused
by
aerial
operations
deaths
and
injured
were
caused
by
international
military
forces
with
the
afghan
air
force
still
working
to
re-establish
itself
the
bulk
of
the
aerial
operations
in
afghanistan
are
the
domain
of
foreign
forces
pre-eminently
the
united
states
during
his
eight-year
tenure
former
president
barack
obama
greatly
expanded
the
use
of
drones
in
the
united
states
foreign
incursions
including
afghanistan
this
expansion
of
the
drone
war
combined
with
the
trump
administration's
desire
to
bring
an
end
to
the
u.s.
invasion
have
now
led
to
two
consecutive
quarters
in
which
the
kabul
government
and
its
foreign
backers
are
responsible
for
more
civilian
deaths
than
the
taliban
and
isis
combined
in
fact
the
latest
u.n.
report
indicates
a
increase
in
overall
civilian
casualties
from
aerial
operations
with
a
doubling
of
the
number
of
civilian
deaths
from
such
attacks
these
numbers
said
the
u.n.
highlight
the
lethal
character
of
this
tactic
col
sonny
leggett
a
spokesman
for
the

of

as
human

and
attempt
to
hide
the
truth
through
lies
and
propaganda
leggett
told
the
times
most
air
and
drone
strikes
and
night
raids
take
place
in
remote
and
insecure
areas
of
the
country
making
it
more
difficult
for
the
media
and
rights
groups
to
investigate
the
government's
usual
claims
of
taliban
or
militants
being
killed
residents
in
the
dasht-e
archi
district
of
kunduz
province
where
a
airstrike
on
a

left
more
than
children
dead
questioned
the
strategy
behind
such
attacks
saif-ur-rahman
who
has
spent
his
entire
life
in
kunduz
said
dasht-e-archi
is
full
of
taliban
why
attack
them
during
an
event
like
this
why
not
attack
them
when
they
are
traveling
freely
on
the
roads
the
latest
civilian
casualty
figures
come
nearly
five
years
after
the
obama
administration
announced
the
end
of
u.s.
combat
missions
in
afghanistan
at
that
time
the
u.s.
and
other
foreign
forces
were
supposed
to
transition
into
new
roles
training
and
advising
the
afghan
national
security
forces
however
in
recent
years
u.s.
forces
have
been
involved
in
both
aerial
operations
and
night
raids
during
which
american
and
afghan
forces
enter
villages
and
homes
under
the
cover
of
darkness
patricia
gossman
associate
asia
director
for
human
rights
watch
said
that
the
trend
is
not
irreversible
and
in
that
in
washington
did
take
some
steps
to
mitigate
civilian
casualties
caused
by
aerial
operations
this
included
the
creation
of
a
civilian
casualties
mitigation
team
which
had
the
resources
and
staff
to
investigate
incidents
of
civilian
killings
and
recommend
measures
that
would
affect
how
targets
are
chosen
but
those
efforts
have
been
substantially
eroded
in
the
intervening
years
all
of
that
has
essentially
been
thrown
out
the
window
in
a
misguided
effort
to
pressure
the
taliban
through
air
strikes
and
night
raids
said
gossman
gossman
said
rights
groups
are
particularly
concerned
by
the
use
of
clandestine
forces
under
the
guidance
of
the
cia
during
the
already
controversial
nighttime
raids
which
see
these
forces
detain
or
summarily
execute
suspected
taliban
and
civilians
in
then-afghan
president
hamid
karzai
greatly
restricted
the
use
of
nighttime
raids
that
same
year
u.s.
special
forces
and
their
afghan
allies
were
accused
of
carrying
out
both
disappearances
and
killings
many
during
night
raids
in
the
eastern
province
of
maidan
wardak
however
shortly
after
coming
into
power
in
the
autumn
of
the
national
unity
government
headed
by
president
ashraf
ghani
lifted
any
limits
on
the
practice
this
included
allowing
u.s.
special
operations
forces
to
serve
in
an
advisory
role
during
such
raids
a
source
who
has
been
in
contact
with
the
office
of
zalmay
khalilzad
washington's
chief
negotiator
in
talks
with
the
taliban
in
doha
told
thinkprogress
that
these
tactics
including
the
air
strikes
and
nighttime
raids
are
driven
very
much
by
the
u.s.
agenda
to
put
maximum
pressure
on
the
taliban
the
trump
administration
is
hoping
to
engage
in
face-to-face
negotiations
that
could
lead
to
an
in
end
in
the
u.s.
incursion
said
the
source
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
like
u.s.
military
officials
afghan
government
officials
claim
that
taliban
use
civilian
homes
as
a
source
of
protection
the
taliban
are
using
people's
homes
as
shields
said
one
source
from
the
ministry
of
defense
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
however
rather
than
putting
pressure
on
the
taliban
these
tactics
are
merely
leading
to
more
anger
among
the
afghan
people
in
july
residents
in
the
northern
province
of
baghlan
protested
after
an
afghan
army
helicopter
bombardment
killed
seven
civilians
including
three
women
july
also
saw
protests
in
maidan
wardak
province
where
residents
maintain
that
airstrikes
and
night
raids
are
leading
to
increased
civilian
casualties
despite
complaints
to
the
presidential
palace
and
intelligence
officials
the
residents
threatened
to
boycott
the
sept
presidential
elections
if
proper
action
was
not
taken
once
again
the
afghan
government
has
opted
for
short
term
political
expediency
but
in
fact
they
are
causing
more
harm
to
afghan
families
fueling
resentment
and
grievances
and
undermining
any
chance
of
building
accountable
security
institutions
