brazil
rejects
g
s
already
minuscule
aid
package
to
help
combat
raging
fires
in
the
amazon
the
most
powerful
countries
in
the
world
pledged
million
for
context
netflix
paid
million
to
keep
streaming
friends
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
million
is
not
that
much
money
sure
it'll
buy
you
a
nice
mansion
or
finance
a
small
movie
but
when
it
comes
to
fighting
tens
of
thousands
of
fires
currently
devastating
a
rainforest
that
is
more
than
two-thirds
the
size
of
the
continental
united
states
and
which
is
essential
to
any
ability
we
have
to
fight
back
against
global
warming
you're
going
to
need
a
bit
more
cash
nonetheless
million
was
all
that
leaders
of
the
g
which
consists
of
the
world's
most
powerful
economies
could
agree
to
commit
towards
assisting
brazil
and
its
neighbors
in
protecting
the
amazon
and
fighting
the
fires
that
are
currently
burning
it
to
the
ground
the
small
commitment
was
a
victory
for
french
president
emmanuel
macron
who
had
called
the
situation
an
international
crisis
and
tweeted
last
week
that
our
house
is
burning
literally
but
in
a
series
of
irate
tweets
on
monday
brazil's
far-right
president
jair
bolsonaro
rejected
the
multinational
aid
offer
saying
that
the
fires
were
an
internal
matter
and
that
the
country
didn't
need
outside
assistance
we
cannot
accept
that
president
macron
unleashes
improper
and
unreasonable
attacks
on
the
amazon
nor
disguises
his
intentions
behind
the
idea
of
an
alliance
of
countries
for
the
g
to
save
the
amazon
as
if
we
were
a
colony
or
no
man's
land
bolsonaro
said
other
heads
of
state
sympathize
with
brazil
after
all
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
any
country
is
the
least
that
can
be
expected
in
a
civilized
world
on
tuesday
bolsonaro
backtracked
sort
of
by
saying
that
brazil
might
accept
the
aid
if
president
macron
retracted
his
remarks
macron
earlier
this
week
threatened
to
block
a
free-trade
agreement
between
the
european
union
and
brazil
over
the
fires
and
the
two
were
also
feuding
over
a
facebook
meme
bolsonaro
had
liked
about
macron's
wife
which
the
french
president
described
as
extremely
disrespectful
the
irony
here
is
that
for
all
of
bolsonaro's
whining
there's
a
direct
correlation
between
his
big-business
friendly
government
and
the
record
number
of
fires
currently
ablaze
in
the
amazon
not
only
has
bolsonaro
empowered
ranchers
loggers
and
farmers
to
clear
out
the
amazon
for
their
own
profit
but
he
has
also
stacked
his
cabinet
with
figures
who
are
at
worst
climate
change
deniers
or
at
best
completely
apathetic
to
the
dangers
facing
the
amazon
and
subsequently
the
entire
planet
an
example
of
this
apathy
was
reported
by
the
brazilian
outlet
amazonia
real
over
the
weekend
according
to
the
outlet
the
brazilian
environmental
agency
ibama
had
contacted
the
national
guard
and
the
ministry
of
justice
earlier
in
the
month
saying
it
urgently
needed
support
in
the
state
of
para
in
order
to
stop
a
fire
day
earlier
this
month
the
request
was
denied
by
brazilian
justice
minister
we
asked
for
support
from
the
national
guard
which
is
authorized
by
the
ministry
of
justice
one
source
told
amazonia
real
but
it
was
not
available
i
don't
know
why
the
global
anger
over
the
amazon
fires
has
forced
bolsonaro
to
at
least
start
acting
like
he
cares
somewhat
about
the
region
over
the
weekend
he
tweeted
out
a
video
of
a
brazilian
air
force
plane
dropping
flame
retardant
on
the
amazon
and
noted
that
over
military
personnel
were
standing
by
to
be
deployed
to
help
combat
the
fires
but
any
sort
of
international
far-reaching
plan
to
stop
the
fires
and
prevent
them
from
happening
again
has
been
bogged
down
by
bolsonaro's
claims
that
it
is
all
part
of
a
global
plot
to
intrude
upon
brazil's
sovereignty
u.s.
president
donald
trump
meanwhile
has
taken
next-to-no
action
to
encourage
bolsonaro
to
accept
more
assistance
despite
the
warm
rapport
between
the
two
far-right
zealots
trump
tweeted
that
the
u.s.
was
ready
to
assist
with
helping
to
combat
the
fires
but
when
it
came
time
over
the
weekend
to
discuss
climate
change
with
other
world
leaders
at
a
g
meeting
trump
decided
to
skip
it
