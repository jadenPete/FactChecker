trump
repeats
relief
funding
lie
as
tropical
storm
dorian
approaches
puerto
rico
the
president
claims
billion
has
been
distributed
to
puerto
rico
it's
only
been
a
fraction
of
that
president
donald
trump
is
already
trying
to
avoid
responsibility
for
providing
relief
aid
to
puerto
rico
for
a
storm
that
hasn't
even
impacted
the
island
yet
in
a
tweet
tuesday
trump
repeated
a
lie
that
the
island
territory
has
already
received
far
more
aid
than
it
actually
had
and
seemed
to
blame
puerto
rico
for
its
own
fate
will
it
ever
end
trump
wrote
seemingly
speaking
more
about
the
relief
costs
than
the
catastrophic
weather
congress
approved
billion
dollars
for
puerto
rico
last
year
an
all
time
record
of
its
kind
for
anywhere
earlier
this
year
trump
claimed
that
puerto
rico
had
received
billion
so
he
seems
to
have
inflated
the
number
by
a
billion
but
his
claim
that
puerto
rico
had
already
received
that
much
money
or
that
it
had
otherwise
been
spent
as
insinuated
again
by
his
tweet
tuesday
is
demonstrably
false
the
federal
government's
own
records
tell
a
very
different
story
it's
true
that
congress
has
allocated
a
large
sum
of
money
but
that
was
still
only
around
billion
billion
short
of
trump's
latest
number
so
far
federal
agencies
are
committed
obligated
to
spending
about
billion
of
that
meaning
that
half
of
the
funds
haven't
even
been
touched
even
that
figure
only
speaks
to
how
much
of
the
money
has
been
budgeted
since
hurricanes
irma
and
maria
struck
puerto
rico
two
years
ago
only
about
billion
has
actually
been
spent
repairing
the
island
this
represents
a
seventh
of
trump's
claim
when
trump
first
told
his
billion-dollar
lie
in
april
he
added
his
own
random
estimate
of
an
additional
billion
for
estimated
future
fema
costs
over
the
life
of
the
disaster
in
other
words
trump
just
assumed
of
his
own
accord
that
repairing
puerto
rico
was
going
to
cost
more
than
twice
what
had
been
allocated
and
then
claimed
that
such
a
total
had
already
been
spent
but
it
hasn't
and
claiming
that
congress
had
allocated
that
total
amount
itself
is
a
new
twist
on
the
lie
shortly
after
trump
tweeted
nbc
news
reported
that
the
administration
is
actually
taking
million
away
from
the
department
of
homeland
security
including
fema's
disaster
relief
fund
to
pay
for
more
immigration
detention
space
and
asylum
hearing
locations
along
the
southern
border
it
did
not
ask
congress
for
permission
to
make
the
reallocation
believing
it
had
the
authority
itself
the
department
of
homeland
security
will
lose
funding
for
coast
guard
operations
and
fema
will
lose
funding
budgeted
to
prepare
for
natural
disasters
like
hurricanes
trump's
complaint
tuesday
that
he
may
have
to
provide
more
disaster
relief
to
puerto
rico
in
the
near
future
comes
just
days
after
axios
reported
that
trump
in
the
past
had
allegedly
suggested
using
a
nuclear
weapon
to
somehow
destroy
hurricanes
trump
publicly
denied
the
story
in
a
tweet
calling
it
just
more
fake
news
given
the
president's
penchant
for
lashing
out
at
stories
that
paint
him
in
a
negative
light
the
response
has
only
fueled
speculation
that
he
did
propose
such
an
idea
tropical
storm
dorian
is
still
weak
but
forecasters
predict
it
could
upgrade
to
a
hurricane
as
it
travels
through
the
caribbean
according
to
the
national
hurricane
center
tuesday
morning
tropical
storm
conditions
are
expected
and
hurricane
conditions
are
possible
in
puerto
rico
on
wednesday
puerto
rico
gov
wanda
v
zquez
declared
a
state
of
emergency
monday
to
prepare
for
what
could
be
coming
some
homes
on
the
island
still
have
blue
tarps
as
roofs
a
testament
to
how
much
has
actually
been
spent
repairing
the
island
this
story
was
updated
to
include
reports
that
the
trump
administration
was
taking
funding
away
from
fema's
disaster
relief
fund
