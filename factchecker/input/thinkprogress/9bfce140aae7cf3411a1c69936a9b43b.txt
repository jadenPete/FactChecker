before
trump
criticized
the
urban
poverty
he
uses
to
attack
democrats
he
profited
from
it
the
president's
transparently
dishonest
attacks
on
cities
in
cincinnati
conveniently
erase
the
role
played
by
greedy
cheating
developers
like
himself
cities
are
the
problem
president
donald
trump
told
a
typically
riled-up
crowd
thursday
night
in
cincinnati
and
their
problems
are
democrats
fault
the
latest
iteration
of
the
president's
evolving
attack
on
urban
and
specifically
majority-black
communities
expanded
past
baltimore
to
encompass
los
angeles
san
francisco
and
chicago
in
each
case
he
said
these
communities
have
been
run
exclusively
by
democrat
politicians
whose
tapping
of
federal
programs
amounts
to
stolen
money
and
wasted
money
but
trump's
caricatured
version
of
city
life
is
especially
cynical
given
the
fact
that
he's
mounted
a
considerable
effort
during
his
time
in
office
to
cause
the
very
dereliction
for
which
he
blames
others
he's
proposed
eliminating
the
main
federal
grant
program
that
cities
use
to
build
new
public
resources
and
refurbish
old
ones
he's
repeatedly
plotted
to
evict
millions
of
the
most
vulnerable
people
from
their
existing
housing
he's
asked
for
roughly
a
trillion
dollars
in
cuts
to
health
care
programs
for
the
poor
and
elderly
and
when
his
budget
cuts
have
been
largely
stymied
by
congressional
democrats
trump
has
slipped
punishing
austerity
in
through
the
side
door
his
agencies
are
using
their
regulatory
authority
to
kick
millions
of
working
people
off
of
food
stamps
for
daring
to
save
a
bit
of
money
to
kick
millions
of
other
citizens
off
medicaid
for
the
crime
of
being
unable
to
find
work
and
to
rip
down
safeguards
that
protect
them
from
the
greed
of
developers
where
he's
been
unable
to
punish
inner-city
communities
by
shutting
off
the
funding
faucet
he
has
introduced
new
barriers
in
the
form
of
paperwork
and
bureaucracy
but
the
hypocrisy
of
his
new
heel-turn
against
the
cities
where
most
americans
reside
also
long
predates
his
time
in
office
the
president
made
his
wealth
on
business
practices
that
hollow
out
urban
cores
exacerbate
inequality
push
low-income
residents
out
and
relocate
social
problems
rather
than
ameliorate
them
trump's
habitual
exaggeration
of
the
crime
drug
and
public
health
challenges
facing
various
cities
notwithstanding
to
the
extent
that
cities
do
have
such
problems
they
are
the
byproduct
of
the
shameless
wealth-hoarding
behavior
of
developers
like
him
economists
have
a
fancy
term
for
the
bad
things
a
business
venture
causes
for
others
during
their
pursuit
of
profit
negative
externalities
the
civic
struggles
trump
is
now
lambasting
for
political
gain
are
in
fact
negative
externalities
to
the
rich
fancy-lad
class
of
goons
from
which
he
sprung
trump's
celebrity
and
wealth
were
built
on
depriving
cities
of
the
resources
they
need
for
sustained
success
in
both
raw
economic
terms
and
at
the
less
tangible
level
of
social
fabric
the
modern
history
of
u.s.
urban
policy
has
been
shaped
by
private
money
most
political
leaders
have
embraced
the
idea
that
profit-motivated
developers
should
be
the
primary
engine
of
the
various
socioeconomic
goals
that
cities
must
pursue
they
are
willing
to
lavish
generous
tax
breaks
on
these
developers
to
induce
them
to
break
ground
and
they
are
eager
to
swap
ownership
of
the
ground
itself
if
they
must
be
clear
that
land
was
yours
and
the
money
for
those
tax
breaks
comes
from
you
the
mayors
who
make
these
deals
are
taking
your
stuff
and
giving
it
to
rich
people
it's
odd
at
surface
level
to
give
away
money
and
land
to
plutocrats
but
it
isn't
as
crooked
as
it
sounds
it's
based
in
a
sincere
if
arguably
misguided
belief
about
how
to
do
the
most
good
for
the
most
people
at
the
fastest
possible
pace
the
idea
the
developer-reliant
urban
leadership
model
holds
is
to
generate
economic
activity
you
get
the
developers
to
build
so
that
there
will
be
builders
who
get
paid
wages
that
they
can
then
spend
in
the
neighborhoods
where
they
live
those
doughty
edifices
wrought
from
this
exchange
provide
residents
with
reasons
to
come
to
the
areas
surrounding
what
they
build
and
to
bring
their
wallets
with
them
when
they
come
it's
all
meant
to
prop
up
another
of
those
economics-jargon
clich
s
the
virtuous
cycle
trump's
history
in
the
real
estate
business
exposes
the
weaknesses
of
this
developmental
idea
however
instead
of
paying
an
honest
wage
for
honest
work
trump
has
historically
underpaid
or
stiffed
his
contractors
outright
wiping
out
the
first
leg
of
the
stool
supporting
the
virtuous
cycle
instead
of
taking
some
of
the
tax
incentive
money
and
land
value
received
from
the
public
trust
to
distribute
it
more
widely
trump
and
many
other
developers
hoarded
it
as
aggressively
as
he
could
the
undocumented
poles
whom
trump
hired
to
rip
asbestos
out
of
the
department
store
that
was
in
the
way
of
trump
tower's
footprint
in
did
not
get
put
on
a
path
toward
self-sufficiency
that
allowed
them
to
spend
money
into
a
virtuous
cycle
of
working-class
rebirth
they
got
an
hour
if
they
got
anything
at
all
most
didn't
the
lawsuit
trump
settled
with
them
years
later
claimed
public
resources
shoveled
to
trump
haven't
transferred
back
to
working-class
payouts
in
his
other
projects
either
ask
the
atlantic
city
cabinet-hanger
who
lost
the
business
his
father
founded
in
the
s
to
trump's
petty-greed
habit
if
you
don't
believe
him
ask
the
other
contractors
there
who
were
forced
to
sue
trump
over
unpaid
bills
or
the
plainview
new
york-based
hvac
firm
that
had
to
slap
a
lien
on
trump's
firm
when
he
bailed
on
making
payments
or
juan
carlos
rodriguez
who
agreed
to
deliver
a
large
painting
job
at
trump's
prized
doral
golf
course
in
florida
but
was
forced
to
sue
and
seek
a
court-ordered
foreclosure
on
the
golf
complex
just
to
get
trump
to
make
good
on
their
deal
the
developmentalist
policy
idea
leads
to
wildly
unequal
transactions
with
men
like
trump
the
public
servants
are
expecting
dollars
to
circulate
when
they
hand
them
over
and
the
man
pocketing
them
is
scheming
to
keep
them
in
his
own
pocket
and
that's
just
the
build
phase
of
trump's
turn
at
the
board
the
rest
of
the
developmentalist
cycle
the
increased
foot
traffic
the
expected
harmonious
rise
of
mixed-income
neighborhoods
never
comes
to
pass
either
what
men
like
trump
build
they
build
for
rich
people
the
poor
and
unfortunate
who
had
lived
where
projects
like
trump
tower
reclaim
for
the
wealthy
are
not
welcomed
or
afforded
new
opportunities
at
upward
mobility
by
the
redevelopment
they
are
displaced
by
it
their
incomes
stagnate
as
the
cost
of
living
where
they
live
skyrockets
with
the
nigh-inevitable
result
that
they
are
forced
to
relocate
and
the
privation
often
follows
them
to
their
new
homes
this
more
vicious
cycle
means
that
economically
dislocated
urban
resident
continue
to
rely
on
assistance
to
get
by
in
their
new
surroundings
from
programs
like
medicaid
or
food
stamps
or
rent
subsidies
and
it
means
they
remain
stuck
dealing
with
slumlords
who
won't
lift
a
finger
to
deal
with
rats
and
roaches
because
every
such
effort
cuts
into
their
own
profits
men
like
jared
kushner
whose
residential
offerings
in
the
baltimore
area
epitomize
the
conditions
his
father-in-law
is
trying
to
blame
on
democrats
writ
large
which
brings
us
back
from
trump
the
builder
to
trump
the
president
he
has
sought
to
slash
funding
for
all
these
programs
he
has
proposed
more
than
a
trillion
dollars
in
cuts
to
public
programs
for
low-income
working
people
those
cuts
drill
the
rural
areas
he's
now
trying
to
energize
through
the
divisive
flavor
of
rhetoric
he
refined
thursday
night
in
cincinnati
too
but
the
city
settings
where
populations
are
densest
see
a
far
greater
geographic
concentration
of
the
human
impacts
of
austerity
the
resulting
contrast
primes
both
city-dwellers
and
country
folk
to
view
one
another
with
mutual
suspicion
the
casually
cruel
ironies
of
his
attacks
on
city
folk
go
even
deeper
however
the
same
high-density
population
zones
he's
calling
thieves
at
his
rallies
while
trying
to
stiff
through
policy
choices
are
also
much
more
self-sufficient
in
overall
fiscal
terms
than
the
redder
more
rural
areas
to
which
he
often
panders
urban
counties
pay
more
in
taxes
than
they
receive
in
public
services
in
rural
areas
the
opposite
is
true
the
city-dwellers
trump
is
so
fond
of
attacking
are
actually
subsidizing
everyone
else's
lifestyles
country
mouse
is
eating
city
mouse's
cheese
not
the
other
way
around
that's
a
sensitive
and
pride-stinging
economic
reality
and
one
that
has
driven
mutual
resentment
for
longer
than
trump's
been
on
the
scene
but
the
president's
innovation
here
is
his
willingness
to
simply
lie
about
how
money
circulates
among
fellow
americans
when
karl
rove
engaged
in
the
same
sort
of
politics
he
framed
the
matter
as
one
of
cultural
differences
the
values
of
real
america
versus
everywhere
else
many
conservatives
still
rely
on
this
poisoned
rhetoric
as
illustrated
by
the
right's
applause
for
sen
josh
hawley's
r-mo
recent
and
dishonest
speech
decrying
cosmopolitan
america
trump
meanwhile
doesn't
look
to
change
the
subject
away
from
how
rural
america
benefits
from
urban
america's
labor
he
just
lies
about
who
gets
what
largesse
from
whom
and
about
how
he
got
rich
making
it
worse
