while
you
slept
a
second
mass
shooter
murdered
ten
people
last
night
it
never
ends
on
saturday
a
man
with
an
assault
rifle
walked
into
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
and
shot
people
as
of
this
writing
are
dead
but
america
did
not
even
get
a
full
day
to
mourn
those
deaths
early
sunday
morning
as
most
of
the
nation
slept
a
second
shooter
murdered
ten
people
in
a
bar
in
dayton
ohio
the
second
shooting
according
to
mayor
nan
whaley
lasted
less
than
one
minute
before
first
responders
neutralized
the
shooter
the
shooter
is
also
dead
there
have
been
at
least
mass
shootings
in
the
united
states
in
according
to
the
gun
violence
archive
a
website
that
tracks
shooting
incidents
where
four
or
more
people
are
shot
meanwhile
those
mass
shootings
are
only
a
small
part
of
a
much
broader
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
the
united
states
in
people
were
killed
by
guns
and
that's
actually
a
drop
from
recent
years
the
deadliest
weapon
is
the
handgun
owing
to
its
ability
to
be
easily
concealed
and
yet
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
this
preferred
weapon
of
murderers
enjoys
special
constitutional
protection
and
cannot
be
banned
the
rate
of
gun-related
murder
and
non-negligent
manslaughter
in
the
united
states
was
times
higher
than
canada's
in
unlike
the
united
states
canada
has
strict
gun
laws
all
gun
owners
must
be
licensed
and
handguns
may
not
be
carried
outside
the
home
without
a
special
license
that
is
typically
only
given
to
people
who
need
a
gun
for
their
job
this
piece
has
been
updated
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
death
count
in
the
dayton
shooting
is
now
ten
