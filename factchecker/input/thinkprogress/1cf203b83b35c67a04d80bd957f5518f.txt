john
bolton
makes
grand
trade
promise
to
uk
if
it
leaves
the
eu
british
media
has
its
doubts
calling
the
national
security
adviser
a
snake
for
comments
that
could
lead
to
a
no-deal
brexit
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
made
an
extraordinary
promise
while
on
a
visit
to
london
monday
pledging
that
the
united
kingdom
would
jump
to
the
front
of
the
queue
for
trade
with
the
united
states
if
it
went
ahead
and
left
the
european
union
already
some
are
concerned
that
the
promise
of
such
trade
favoritism
might
prompt
an
inevitable
no-deal
brexit
the
kind
u.k.
officials
have
long
hoped
to
avoid
if
that's
the
decision
of
the
british
government
we
will
support
it
enthusiastically
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
convey
we're
with
you
we're
with
you
bolton
told
reporters
on
the
first
day
of
his
two-day
visit
he
emphasized
that
the
united
states
didn't
want
to
pressure
the
u.k.
to
leave
the
eu
in
an
arrangement
dubbed
brexit
but
to
support
it
in
doing
so
the
u.k.
voted
in
to
leave
the
eu
but
has
thus
far
failed
to
get
a
deal
passed
in
parliament
bolton's
gesture
was
not
met
with
smiles
on
all
fronts
an
op-ed
in
the
guardian
pointed
out
on
tuesday
that
the
offer
was
actually
a
move
to
colonize
the
u.k.
and
another
in
the
independent
called
the
national
security
adviser
a
snake
prime
minister
theresa
may
tried
and
failed
repeatedly
to
get
a
deal
passed
and
now
prime
minister
boris
johnson
has
until
october
to
reach
a
deal
if
he
fails
to
do
so
then
the
u.k.
will
find
itself
in
a
no-deal
brexit
which
will
throw
things
further
into
chaos
notably
trade
at
the
border
of
northern
ireland
which
is
in
the
u.k.
and
the
republic
of
ireland
which
is
in
the
eu
johnson
would
like
the
eu
to
renegotiate
elements
of
the
deal
but
brussels
so
far
has
refused
to
do
so
as
it
did
when
may
repeatedly
made
the
same
request
it
is
now
up
to
the
u.k.
to
figure
out
how
to
make
brexit
work
within
its
own
laws
and
regulations
president
donald
trump
who
is
not
a
fan
of
multilateral
agreements
has
been
a
brexiteer
from
the
jump
he
also
openly
chastised
may
for
her
failure
to
pass
a
deal
in
parliament
in
saying
that
the
united
states
would
support
the
u.k.
s
departure
from
the
eu
but
not
a
decision
to
remain
bolton
is
stating
a
policy
for
a
national
security
adviser
to
make
trade
policy
promises
on
the
premise
that
a
country
make
a
major
policy
change
is
remarkable
the
united
states
meanwhile
remains
embroiled
in
a
trade
war
with
china
with
tariffs
and
counter-tariffs
flying
and
almost
nothing
happening
in
the
way
of
negotiations
trump's
landmark
trade
deal
is
also
at
a
standstill
the
usmca
which
was
to
replace
nafta
the
longstanding
agreement
between
the
united
states
mexico
and
canada
has
yet
to
be
ratified
and
as
of
now
is
dying
on
the
vine
per
the
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
the
u.k.
is
the
seventh
largest
trade
partner
with
the
united
states
and
the
fourth
largest
export
destination
for
american
goods
it
accounts
for
of
foreign
investment
in
the
united
states
there
is
of
course
room
for
improvement
even
in
an
already
strong
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
u.k.
but
there's
also
healthy
skepticism
about
what
the
trump
administration
may
want
in
return
this
is
a
highly
transactional
administration
said
jack
straw
former
foreign
secretary
under
prime
minister
tony
blair
in
an
interview
with
the
bbc's
radio
on
tuesday
he
added
you
don't
get
something
for
nothing
indeed
the
trump
administration
might
have
already
tipped
its
hand
on
this
one
in
february
the
administration
published
its
objectives
for
trade
with
the
u.k.
moving
forward
those
objectives
speak
to
a
weak
post-brexit
u.k.
that
would
have
to
bring
itself
in
line
with
u.s.
regulations
something
that
won't
be
in
the
interests
of
a
u.k.
that
will
still
want
to
trade
with
the
eu
the
trump
administration
would
also
like
to
deregulate
the
health
service
in
the
u.k.
by
preventing
the
the
undermining
of
market
access
for
u.s.
products
through
the
improper
use
of
the
uk's
system
for
protecting
or
recognizing
geographical
indications
and
providing
full
market
access
for
u.s.
products
