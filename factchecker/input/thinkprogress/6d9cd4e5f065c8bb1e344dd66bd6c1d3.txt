the
country
lag
in
recovery
efforts
following
devastating
storms
over
the
past
two
years
democratic
leadership
this
week
criticized
president
donald
trump's
prioritization
of
hardline
immigration
policies
over
disaster
preparation
and
relief
but
trump
has
ignored
those
comments
focusing
instead
on
puerto
rico
a
long-running
source
of
ire
for
the
white
house
with

currently
a
tropical
storm
with
the
potential
to
become
a
hurricane
drawing
nearer
to
the

trump
on
wednesday
morning
tweeted
that
as
usual
puerto
rico
would
likely
face
extreme
weather
the
president's
comments
referenced
hurricane
maria
in
which
left
the
island
completely
devastated
fema
and
all
others
are
ready
and
will
do
a
great
job
when
they
do
let
them
know
it
and
give
them
a
big
thank

his

among
the

naysayers
trump's
latest
remarks
followed
a
tuesday
tweet
in
which
the
president
wrote
yet
another
big
storm
heading
to
puerto
rico
will
it
ever
end
trump
has
historically
claimed
falsely
that
puerto
rico
has
received
billion
in
aid
from
the
u.s.
government
using
the
number
as
a
justification
for
blocking
more
funds
for
the
island
he
appeared
to
return
to
that
line
of
argument
with
his
tweets
on
tuesday
congress
approved
billion
dollars
for
puerto
rico
last
year
an
all
time
record
of
its
kind
for
anywhere
he
asserted
as
a
small
island
off
the
southeastern
u.s.
coast
puerto
rico
is
disproportionately
vulnerable
to
hurricanes
a
slow
recovery
from
maria
has
also
left
the
island
in
poor
condition
to
respond
to
yet
another
hurricane
as
part
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
fema
has
endured
repeated
criticism
over
the
agency's
botched
response
to
maria
with
internal
findings
showing
fema
was
deeply
understaffed
and
ill-prepared
to
deal
with
a
disaster
on
the
scale
of
the
category
hurricane
at
the
time
since
the
departure
of
agency
head
brock
long
earlier
this
year
fema
also
remains
without
a
permanent
administrator
during
a
hearing
this
june
acting
fema
administrator
peter
gaynor
admitted
that
the
agency
was
short
a
few
thousand
employees
with
atlantic
hurricane
season
already
underway
long
the
agency's
former
head
told
e
e
in
a
recent
interview
that
the
agency
is
dying
a
death
by
cuts
as
it
struggles
to
overcome
staffing
and
budget
challenges
as
well
as
a
lack
of
direction
now
fema
is
set
for
another
blow
trump
administration
officials
on
tuesday
said
that
million
in
funds
will
be
moved
from
several
agencies
to
support
border
enforcement
of
that
amount
million
will
come
from
fema
while
the
rest
will
come
from
the
u.s.
coast
guard
and
other
sources
when
dhs
notified
congress
about
the
transfer
in
july
officials
said
that
absent
significant
new
catastrophic
events
fema's
disaster
relief
fund
is
expected
to
operate
smoothly
without
the
additional
money
democrats
however
have
slammed
the
decision
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-ca
called
the
move
stunningly
reckless
and
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-ny
panned
the
white
house's
priorities
taking
these
critical
funds
from
disaster
preparedness
and
recovery
efforts
threatens
lives
and
weakens
the
government's
ability
to
help
americans
in
the
wake
of
natural
disasters
schumer
said
organizations
including
amnesty
international
similarly
criticized
the
trump
administration's
actions
as
outrageous
moving
money
around
between
federal
agencies
is
common
and
under
trump
dhs
has
directed
millions
from
fema
and
others
to
ice
but
the
looming
prospect
of
dorian
is
likely
to
heighten
tensions
particularly
in
puerto
rico
as
of
wednesday
morning
the
island
was
under
hurricane
watch
and
had
declared
a
state
of
emergency
the
national
hurricane
center
nhc
said
that
dorian
will
likely
gain
some
speed
before
passing
over
puerto
rico
on
wednesday
the
u.s.
virgin
islands
are
also
bracing
for
rain
and
flooding
but
things
could
worsen
from
there
an
updated
forecast
has
dorian
regaining
speed
and
strengthening
to
a
category
hurricane
as
it
moves
past
the
islands
and
heads
towards
florida
potentially
hitting
as
early
as
sunday
trump
for
his
part
continued
tweeting
late
into
wednesday
morning
taking
aim
at
puerto
rico
puerto
rico
is
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
the
president
declared
and
by
the
way
i'm
the
best
thing
that's
ever
happened
to
puerto
rico
