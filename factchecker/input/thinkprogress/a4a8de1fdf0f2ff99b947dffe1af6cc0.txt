why
are
mike
huckabee
and
rick
santorum
hanging
out
in
russia
for
thousands
of
dollars
you
can
join
these
former
gop
stalwarts
on
a
baltic
tour
at
a
time
when
u.s.
russian
relations
are
at
a
post-cold
war
nadir
former
gop
stalwarts
mike
huckabee
and
rick
santorum
decided
to
visit
st
petersburg
according
to
huckabee's
twitter
feed
the
two
have
spent
the
past
few
days
in
russia
touring
the
city
and
visiting
seaside
restaurants
the
two
are
helping
lead
a
for-profit
cruise
through
the
baltic
sea
one
that
costs
guests
anywhere
between
and
to
attend
on
facebook
huckabee
pitched
the
cruise
as
an
unforgettable
trip
to
the
baltics
noting
that
it
would
also
be
stopping
in
estonia
finland
sweden
and
denmark
it's
unclear
how
many
participants
are
joining
huckabee
and
santorum
on
the
cruise
as
cruise
organizers
did
not
respond
to
thinkprogress
questions
on
twitter
huckabee
pitched
the
cruise
as
an
opportunity
to
actually
collude
with
russia
in
a
good
way
huckabee's
wife
janet
huckabee
also
joined
in
saying
of
her
time
in
st
petersburg
we
were
colluding
but
it's
unclear
whether
huckabee
and
santorum
have
sought
meetings
with
any
russian
officials
while
in
st
petersburg
much
as
leading
evangelical
franklin
graham
did
a
few
months
ago
when
he
had
a
sit-down
meeting
with
sanctioned
russian
politician
vyacheslav
volodin
graham
later
claimed
that
vice
president
mike
pence
signed
off
on
his
trip
instead
it
appears
that
huckabee
is
using
the
trip
to
simply
make
money
as
well
as
push
jokes
about
the
trump
campaign's
attempts
at
collusion
with
russia
huckabee
had
plenty
more
jokes
for
twitter
pointing
out
that
he
would
have
arrived
shirtless
la
russian
president
vladimir
putin
but
didn't
want
to
over
excite
sic
the
russian
women
in
another
tweet
huckabee
also
pointed
to
a
restaurant
called
the
idiot
named
for
fyodor
dostoevsky's
eponymous
novel
huckabee
instead
claimed
the
restaurant
was
named
after
him
the
timing
of
santorum's
and
huckabee's
visit
is
to
say
the
least
odd
special
counsel
robert
mueller
recently
laid
out
for
congress
the
myriad
ways
russia
attempted
to
interfere
in
the
presidential
election
and
plans
to
interfere
in
the
next
election
as
well
u.s.
russian
relations
continue
to
deteriorate
across
other
fronts
from
arms
control
to
security
concerns
santorum
hasn't
yet
publicly
commented
on
the
trip
but
it
also
comes
amid
questions
about
his
relationship
with
convicted
russian
agent
maria
butina
santorum
was
one
of
the
few
high-profile
gop
figures
butina
met
during
her
time
in
the
united
states
a
photo
of
the
two
of
them
captured
both
smiling
for
the
camera
