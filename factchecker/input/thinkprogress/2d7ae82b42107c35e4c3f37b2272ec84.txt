the
way
to
lift
people
out
of
poverty
is
to
let
them
use
dangerous
chemicals
and
sharp
blades
without
training
a
video

the
koch

flagship
anti-government
organization
presents
a
bold
new
strategy
to
break
the
cycle
of
poverty
in
america
get
rid
of
educational
and
licensing
requirements
for
professionals
such
as
cosmetologists

a

another
koch-linked
anti-government
organization
arguing
against
government
licensing
of
professionals
laws
he
claims
are
designed
to
keep
people
out
the
group
also
created
a
website
and
petition
urging
government
to
stop
burdensome
licensing
laws
an
occupational
license
is
a
government
permission
slip
to
work
carpenter
says
in
one
video
to
work
in
an
occupation
of
your
choice
you
have
to
satisfy
the
government
and
you
do
so
by
prescribed
education
and
experience
pay
a
fee
pass
an
exam
before
you
can
actually
work
in
the
occupation
of
your
choice
he
acknowledges
that
the
aim
of
these
requirements
is
to
weed
out
charlatans
and
quacks
and
other
people
who
may
not
be
skilled
but
claims
that
research
shows
those
presumed
benefits
simply
have
not
paid
off
and
consumers
pay
more
for
their
goods
and
services
as
a
result
of
licensing
while
it
is
likely
true
that
people
pay
more
to
be
treated
by
a
neurologist
who
has
actually
been
to
medical
school
and
demonstrated
basic
knowledge
of
how
the
nervous
system
works
it
is
unclear
how
public
health
would
be
improved
by
allowing
anyone
with
a
stethoscope
and
a
dream
to
open
a
medical
practice
a
spokesperson
for
the
organization
said
in
an
email
that
they
would
not
take
the
argument
to
that
far
we
aren't
suggesting
that
doctors
and
pilots
shouldn't
have
credentials
and
levels
of
competency
to
obtain
americans
for
prosperity's
director
of
employment
initiatives
erica
jedynak
said
in
an
email
our
goal
is
to
ensure
that
government
oversight
is
appropriate
for
each
profession
in
reality
many
of
the
professions
that
now
require
licenses
have
little
or
no
impact
on
public
health
and
safety
even
worse
there's
ample
evidence
that
these
policies
have
a
profoundly
negative
impact
on
people
experiencing
poverty
block
employment
opportunities
and
raise
the
cost
of
the
goods
and
services
for
millions
of
ordinary
americans
but
the
group's
videos
do
argue
for
deregulation
in
fields
where
public
health
and
safety
is
a
concern
in
the
second
video
carpenter
claims
that
removing
the
barriers
of
licensing
will
mean
more
competition
and
presumably
lower
prices
for
consumers
across
the
way
as
well
as
more
innovation
in
the
third
video
he
argues
that
licensing
perpetuates
a
cycle
of
poverty
because
only
people
who
can
afford
to
go
to
school
to
learn
their
trade
and
pay
the
licensing
fees
get
to
take
those
jobs
to
make
this
case
he
cites
the
example
of
cosmetology
a
career
he
suggests
low
income
individuals
might
be
interested
in
taking
on
and
one
he
seems
to
suggest
can
be
done
by
just
about
anyone
without
training
to
work
as
a
cosmetologist
you
might
have
to
go
to
school
for
about
a
year
pass
two
examinations
and
pay
significant
fees
just
to
work
on
an
individual's
hair
he
notes
those
with
means
can
afford
to
pay
those
costs
and
earn
those
licenses
but
those
from
economically
disadvantaged
backgrounds
find
that
they
simply
cannot
afford
those
particular
costs
and
that
means
there
are
certain
occupations
that
are
out
of
reach
for
them
economically
rather
than
address
those
barriers
by
making
college
or
vocational
training
free
a
proposal
americans
for
prosperity
fiercely
opposes
the
group's
solution
is
to
simply
let
people
without
any
training
on
how
to
safely
use
cosmetic
chemicals
razors
scissors
and
other
tools
figure
it
out
on
the
job
jack
gillis
executive
director
of
the
consumer
federation
of
america
told
thinkprogress
that
getting
rid
of
occupational
licensing
would
likely
be
dangerous
to
consumers
clearly
that
type
of
licensing
may
not
be
perfect
but
at
least
it
gives
consumers
a
modicum
of
comfort
when
they
select
a
service
provider
it
also
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
file
a
complaint
about
that
person
or
company
should
that
be
necessary
he
explained
while
he
noted
that
licensing
brings
no
guarantee
that
the
services
provided
will
be
adequate
he
observed
that
at
least
the
consumer
knows
there's
some
oversight
as
well
as
criteria
that
have
been
met
about
that
person
before
they
plunk
their
hard
earned
dollars
down
on
the
service
if
anything
such
licensing
should
be
beefed
up
not
eliminated
gillis
added
that
it
was
likely
there
were
unlicensed
cosmetologists
out
there
already
endangering
themselves
and
others
that's
all
the
more
reason
why
some
form
of
licensing
is
an
important
safety
check
he
added
i
think
it's
not
something
that
can
be
relied
on
but
it's
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
than
making
a
choice
in
the
dark
