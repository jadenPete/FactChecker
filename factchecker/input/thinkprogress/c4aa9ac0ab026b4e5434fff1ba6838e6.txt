republican
congressman
gives
trump's
racism
a
pass
because
he
hasn't
shot
anyone
rep
chris
stewart
recently
voted
against
a
resolution
condemning
the
president's
racist
attacks
on
four
democratic
congresswomen
of
color
angry
constituents
of
rep
chris
stewart
r-ut
flooded
his
town
hall
meeting
in
north
salt
lake
on
wednesday
demanding
to
know
what
he
plans
to
do
to
stop
mass
shootings
and
white
nationalist
terrorism
when
he
offered
them
little
beyond
platitudes
about
racism
being
bad
they
called
him
out
for
his
hypocrisy
according
to
the
salt
lake
tribune
people
attended
the
forum
at
city
hall
the
first
question
stewart
received
was
about
keeping
the
public
safe
from
mass
shootings
like
the
two
that
occurred
over
the
weekend
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
he
answered
by
saying
that
everyone
should
condemn
violence
and
racism
a
constituent
demand
to
know
why
stewart's
voting
record
did
not
match
his
rhetoric
then
why
did
you
vote
no
to
condemn
racism
she
asked
referring
to
his
vote
last
month
against
a
house
resolution
condemning
president
donald
trump's
racist
attacks
on
four
democratic
congresswomen
of
color
stewart
first
responded
by
arguing
the
question
implied
that
he
was
a
racist
why
would
i
support
a
racist
if
i
wasn't
when
another
attendee
suggested
that
condemning
racism
and
violence
should
include
condemning
a
president
whose
racism
is
inciting
white
supremacist
violence
the
utah
republican
replied
that
trump
should
not
be
accountable
as
long
as
he
doesn't
commit
racist
violence
himself
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
far
as
i
know
hasn't
shot
anyone
stewart
answered
another
constituent
shouted
back
that
charles
manson
never
shot
anybody
either
referencing
a
convicted
cult
leader
whose
followers
did
most
of
the
murdering
on
his
behalf
during
his
campaign
trump
boasted
that
his
supporters
were
so
blindly
loyal
that
they
would
back
him
even
if
he
murdered
someone
in
public
view
i
could
stand
in
the
middle
of
fifth
avenue
and
shoot
somebody
okay
and
i
wouldn't
lose
any
voters
okay
he
said
at
an
iowa
rally
stewart
also
expressed
openness
on
wednesday
to
passing
red-flag
laws
to
temporarily
disarm
people
deemed
a
threat
to
the
safety
of
themselves
or
others
but
dismissed
calls
for
strong
gun
restrictions
he
claimed
falsely
that
armed
people
regularly
stop
mass
shootings
incorrectly
stating
that
this
happens
more
often
than
people
realize
after
threatening
to
walk
out
of
the
event
if
his
constituents
did
not
behave
more
civilly
to
him
stewart
presented
a
happy
spin
afterwards
i
appreciate
those
who
attended
in
north
salt
lake
he
tweeted
the
suspected
el
paso
shooter
who
killed
over
the
weekend
allegedly
echoed
trump's
racist
anti-immigrant
rhetoric
in
a
manifesto
written
prior
to
his
attack
which
targeted
and
latinx
people
as
well
as
many
others
numerous
other
attackers
in
recent
months
have
also
cited
trump
as
their
inspiration
