nra-backed
republicans
call
for
action
on
gun
violence
after
ohio
mass
shooting
gov
mike
dewine
lt
gov
jon
husted
and
rep
mike
turner
have
had
enough
in
the
wake
of
a
mass
shooting
in
dayton
ohio
that
left
nine
people
dead
three
of
ohio's
most
prominent
republicans
have
called
for
immediate
legislative
action
to
reduce
gun
violence
all
three
were
endorsed
by
the
national
rifle
association
which
has
virulently
opposed
any
meaningful
actions
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
on
sunday
gov
mike
dewine
r-oh
was
drowned
out
by
chants
of
do
something
as
he
attempted
to
speak
at
a
vigil
dewine
who
had
a
mixed
record
on
gun
control
as
u.s.
senator
but
had
earned
the
nra's
endorsement
in
his
race
after
shifting
to
a
gun-rights
platform
got
the
message
on
monday
dewine
proposed
a
series
of
new
laws
including
a
red-flag
law
to
temporarily
disarm
those
who
pose
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
and
an
expansion
of
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
the
nra
says
it
opposes
expanding
firearm
background
check
systems
because
background
checks
don't
stop
criminals
from
getting
firearms
on
tuesday
rep
mike
turner
r-oh
whom
the
nra
endorsed
last
year
citing
his
proven
pro-second
amendment
record
and
his
commitment
to
protecting
our
right
to
self-defense
also
bucked
the
group
to
call
for
new
gun
laws
after
revealing
that
his
own
daughter
had
been
across
the
street
from
the
mass
shooting
when
it
happened
turner
endorsed
red-flag
laws
magazine
limits
and
a
ban
on
military-style
assault
weapons
the
nra
has
fiercely
opposed
the
limits
on
magazines
and
guns
on
wednesday
lt
governor
jon
husted
r-oh
who
was
also
endorsed
by
the
nra
last
year
for
his
commitment
to
protecting
the
second
amendment
told
cnn
that
he
was
confident
that
the
gop-controlled
ohio
legislature
would
pass
the
governor's
proposals
he
said
he
and
dewine
had
created
the
plan
in
coordination
with
the
state's
gun-rights
community
and
urged
action
at
the
federal
level
because
you
can't
have
states
where
you
can
have
access
to
certain
things
and
not
in
others
the
shift
comes
at
a
time
when
the
american
people's
views
of
the
nra
have
turned
negative
polls
show
the
nation
has
strongly
rejected
the
organization's
intransigent
positions
on
background
checks
and
other
safety
measures
in
recent
years
and
as
of
october
last
year
approximately
of
americans
were
in
favor
of
stricter
laws
for
firearm
sales
