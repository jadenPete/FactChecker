new
york
city
cop
fired
for
illegal
chokehold
death
of
eric
garner
police
commissioner
said
trial
evidence
was
too
compelling
to
allow
daniel
pantaleo
to
serve
as
an
nypd
officer
any
longer
five
years
after
eric
garner's
death
an
event
that
galvanized
the
cry
i
can't
breathe
into
a
national
campaign
against
police
brutality
and
spawned
the
black
lives
matter
movement
officer
daniel
pantaleo
the
police
officer
who
used
the
banned
chokehold
that
killed
garner
has
been
fired
new
york
police
commissioner
james
p.
o'neill
announced
the
decision
at
a
news
conference
monday
telling
reporters
that
pantaleo
was
fired
effective
immediately
from
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
the
unintended
consequence
of
mr
garner's
death
must
have
a
consequence
of
its
own
o'neill
said
during
the
news
conference
therefore
i
agree
with
the
deputy
commissioner
of
trial's
legal
findings
and
recommendations
it
is
clear
that
daniel
pantaleo
can
no
longer
effectively
serve
as
a
new
york
city
police
officer
the
decision
comes
two
weeks
after
a
police
administrative
judge
issued
a
page
decision
ruling
that
pantaleo
violated
the
department's
ban
on
the
use
of
chokeholds
and
recommending
his
firing
in
her
findings
which
followed
an
internal
police
investigation
deputy
commissioner
rosemarie
maldonado
the
police
administrative
judge
noted
that
pantaleo
attempted
to
arrest
an
uncooperative
garner
for
selling
single
untaxed
cigarettes
on
staten
island
in
the
process
of
making
the
arrest
pantaleo
wrapped
his
left
forearm
around
garner's
neck
clasped
his
hands
together
and
choked
him
to
death
that
perfectly
described
a
chokehold
the
submission
procedure
the
nypd
banned
in
after
a
spate
of
deaths
of
criminal
suspects
attributed
to
police
misuse
garner's
death
on
july
became
a
cultural
and
political
flashpoint
largely
because
of
the
cell
phone
video
that
captured
it
which
was
shared
by
social
media
around
the
globe
sampled
from
the
video
garner's
dying
words
i
can't
breathe
became
a
cri
de
coeur
for
a
national
network
of
community
activists
who
took
to
the
streets
and
demanded
accountability
for
police-involved
deaths
of
black
unarmed
citizens
black
lives
matter
became
one
of
the
most
prominent
protesting
groups
to
emerge
from
the
demonstrations
alicia
garza
a
co-founder
of
black
lives
matter
said
pantaleo's
firing
was
necessary
to
heal
the
harm
caused
by
garner's
death
yes
it
is
a
step
forward
and
an
important
one
because
it
signals
that
as
in
other
cases
when
police
do
things
that
are
wrong
that
they
must
be
held
accountable
garza
said
in
a
msnbc
interview
despite
enormous
media
attention
and
widespread
public
anger
over
the
case
pantaleo
remained
on
the
police
force
restricted
to
desk
duty
and
collecting
his
salary
of
a
year
as
his
case
wound
through
a
protracted
legal
maze
previous
efforts
to
punish
pantaleo
fell
short
after
a
staten
island
grand
jury
and
federal
civil
rights
prosecutors
opted
not
to
bring
criminal
charges
against
pantaleo
and
while
new
york
mayor
bill
de
blasio
who
is
a
candidate
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
came
under
withering
criticism
for
seemingly
doing
little
to
charge
or
fire
pantaleo
the
decision
to
terminate
a
police
officer
rests
exclusively
with
the
police
commissioner
in
the
meantime
community
activists
around
the
world
continued
to
call
for
pantaleo's
firing
and
to
demand
justice
for
garner
and
his
family
justice
seemed
to
inch
closer
to
reality
two
weeks
ago
following
a
two-month
disciplinary
trial
that
led
to
maldonado's
recommendation
to
the
police
commission
that
pantaleo
be
fired
it
seems
like
a
no-brainer
and
it
seems
long
overdue
that
should
have
happened
within
weeks
or
months
of
the
incident
nadette
stasa
said
during
an
interview
with
the
new
york
television
station
in
reaction
to
the
judge's
recommendation
stasa
who
works
near
the
spot
where
garner
died
called
the
incident
a
real
tragedy
and
expressed
doubt
that
justice
would
ever
be
served
for
the
dead
man's
family
in
all
likelihood
pantaleo's
firing
doesn't
close
the
book
on
this
issue
since
his
lawyer
stuart
london
told
reporters
he
would
probably
challenge
the
decision
in
court
police
benevolent
association
president
patrick
lynch
had
urged
o'neill
to
stand
with
the
officer
and
not
fire
him
but
o'neill
said
he
couldn't
do
that
given
the
set
of
facts
he
was
presented
in
carrying
out
the
court's
verdict
in
this
case
i
take
no
pleasure
he
said
i
know
that
many
will
disagree
with
this
decision
and
that
is
their
right
there
are
absolutely
no
victors
here
today
not
the
garner
family
not
the
community
at
large
and
certainly
not
the
courageous
men
and
women
of
the
police
department
who
put
their
own
lives
on
the
line
every
single
day
in
service
to
the
people
of
this
great
city
o'neill
said
today
is
a
day
of
reckoning
but
it
can
also
be
a
day
of
reconciliation
