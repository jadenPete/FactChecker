how
a
ukrainian
tycoon
became
cleveland's
commercial
real
estate
kingpin
a
new
lawsuit
highlights
the
ongoing
failings
of
the
u.s.
s
anti-kleptocracy
policies
the
public
square
building
in
downtown
cleveland
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
cleveland
landmark
twenty-two
stories
tall
just
a
couple
of
blocks
from
the
home
of
the
cleveland
indians
designers
completed
the
modernist
office
building
in
a
sign
of
cleveland's
post-war
boom
it
was
also
according
to
a
lawsuit
filed
earlier
this
year
one
of
the
jewels
in
another
crown
that
of
ukrainian
tycoon
ihor
kolomoisky
who
allegedly
stood
as
cleveland's
commercial
real
estate
kingpin
for
years
before
the
bottom
fell
out
of
his
ohio
empire
the
lawsuit
filed
in
delaware
in
may
alleges
that
kolomoisky
and
his
colleagues
at
ukraine's
privatbank
utilized
a
series
of
american
shell
companies
many
based
in
delaware
a
haven
for
foreign
money
to
launder
hundreds
of
million
of
dollars
through
ohio-based
real
estate
all
told
kolomoisky's
alleged
schemes
allowed
him
and
gennadiy
bogolyubov
who
had
joined
kolomoisky
as
a
co-owner
at
ukraine's
privatbank
to
become
the
largest
commercial
real
estate
holders
in
cleveland
ohio
an
spokesperson
for
optima
the
company
used
to
acquire
the
properties
for
kolomoisky
and
bogolyubov
told
thinkprogress
in
a
statement
that
through
our
ownership
and
stewardship
of
the
buildings
we
have
brought
goods
jobs
and
livable
wages
while
helping
to
spearhead
a
massive
revitalization
of
the
once
moribund
district
over
the
last
decade
the
spokesperson
also
pointed
out
that
a
restaurant
in
one
of
the
properties
is
a
runaway
hit
the
lawsuit
as
the
atlantic
council's
anders
aslund
wrote
is
probably
the
most
detailed
study
of
large-scale
money
laundering
into
the
united
states
optima
says
it
fully
expects
to
be
cleared
of
all
allegations
kolomoisky
and
his
colleagues
have
denied
allegations
of
money
laundering
but
haven't
issued
any
denials
pertaining
to
the
real
estate
purchases
themselves
but
the
alleged
scheme
even
if
it
doesn't
hold
up
in
court
points
to
the
massive
holes
remaining
in
the
united
states
burgeoning
anti-kleptocracy
policies
pilot
programs
unveiling
the
identities
of
those
behind
shell
companies
snapping
up
american
real
estate
have
been
wildly
successful
in
the
handful
of
american
cities
in
which
they've
been
implemented
but
still
haven't
been
extended
to
major
american
metropolises
like
cleveland
let
alone
larger
cities
like
houston
or
portland
and
america
remains
arguably
the
greatest
font
of
anonymous
shell
companies
in
the
world
shell
companies
that
according
to
the
lawsuit
allowed
a
staggering
amount
of
cleveland's
downtown
commercial
real
estate
to
become
embroiled
in
a
post-soviet
financial
empire
it's
bad
enough
that
the
dirty
money
from
abroad
has
been
flooding
into
miami
and
new
york
but
it
intuitively
makes
sense
that
criminals
and
the
corrupt
would
want
a
manhattan
penthouse
said
clark
gascoigne
deputy
director
of
the
financial
accountability
and
corporate
transparency
coalition
a
group
advocating
for
the
end
of
anonymous
shell
companies
in
the
united
states
but
when
it
infiltrates
cities
in
the
heartland
of
america
like
cleveland
it
should
be
a
wake-up
call
to
all
of
us
that
we
have
a
serious
problem
in
this
country
and
it
can
happen
anywhere
in
the
united
states
kolomoisky
doesn't
have
anywhere
near
the
notoriety
other
ukrainian
tycoons
do
unlike
others
toppled
in
ukraine's
euromaidan
revolution
kolomoisky
navigated
the
transition
successfully
expanding
his
power
base
where
other
competitors
faltered
indeed
kolomoisky
has
helped
combat
pro-russian
separatists
populating
swaths
of
eastern
ukraine
with
the
ukrainian
businessman
funding
and
directing
a
private
militia
in
the
aftermath
of
the
revolution
he
even
maintained
business
ties
with
ukraine's
new
president
volodymyr
zelensky
who
has
continued
a
post-
trajectory
toward
closer
relations
with
both
the
united
states
and
european
union
but
kolomoisky
has
become
controversial
especially
in
the
past
few
years
after
he
and
bogolyubov
established
privatbank
an
institution
that
eventually
accounted
for
some
of
ukraine's
banking
assets
kolomoisky
proceeded
to
scour
international
markets
for
further
investment
opportunities
centering
primarily
on
steel
and
ferroalloy
companies
but
by
privatbank
faced
a
growing
billion
hole
in
its
accounts
and
ukraine's
central
bank
moved
to
nationalize
privatbank
outright
claiming
that
the
bank
had
transformed
into
a
lending
operation
dedicated
only
to
helping
kolomoisky's
associates
as
the
financial
times
wrote
in
ukraine's
central
bank
governor
said
percent
of
the
bank's
corporate
loan
book
went
to
individuals
or
entities
linked
to
the
bank
or
kolomoisky
or
bogolyubov
both
among
ukraine's
top
five
richest
men
kolomoisky
is
reportedly
worth
just
over
billion
per
forbes
kolomoisky's
fortunes
seemed
to
turn
recently
with
the
election
of
zelensky
who
worked
previously
as
an
actor
on
a
television
channel
kolomoisky
owned
shortly
after
zelensky
won
the
election
against
former
president
petro
poroshenko
earlier
this
year
kolomoisky
returned
to
ukraine
from
self-imposed
exile
it
wasn't
all
warm
welcomes
and
new
beginnings
upon
kolomoisky's
return
in
april
the
daily
beast
reported
that
kolomoisky
was
under
fbi
investigation
for
potential
money
laundering
and
just
two
weeks
after
ending
his
exile
the
new
owners
of
privatbank
filed
a
bombshell
suit
in
the
united
states
alleging
that
kolomoisky's
schemes
while
running
privatbank
weren't
simply
loans
to
friends
but
schemes
to
use
anonymous
u.s.
shell
companies
to
reach
into
america's
heartland
to
enhance
kolomoisky's
own
bottom
line
kolomoisky
is
by
no
means
the
first
member
of
ukraine's
upper
crust
accused
of
using
american
shell
companies
to
bolster
their
kleptocratic
networks
former
ukrainian
prime
minister
pavlo
lazarenko
created
a
network
of
anonymous
shell
companies
based
out
of
a
small
house
in
residential
cheyenne
wyoming
according
to
transparency
international
lazarenko
allegedly
used
the
network
to
embezzle
up
to
million
enough
to
have
him
listed
among
the
most
notorious
kleptocrats
of
past
few
decades
alongside
dictators
like
suharto
ferdinand
marcos
and
slobodan
milosevic
some
years
after
lazarenko's
operations
ended
the
lawsuit
recently
filed
against
kolomoisky
alleged
a
strikingly
similar
scheme
according
to
the
lawsuit
kolomoisky
and
his
associates
created
a
network
of
shell
companies
and
filtered
the
proceeds
through
downtown
cleveland
and
a
number
of
ohio-based
steel
plants
along
the
way
the
alleged
scheme
was
simple
enough
the
lawsuit
claims
kolomoisky
and
bogolyubov
skimmed
money
from
public
bonds
and
some
million
ukrainian
citizens
who
banked
with
privatbank
to
create
a
loan
recycling
scheme
similar
to
a
ponzi
scheme
it
was
as
the
deputy
head
of
the
national
bank
of
ukraine
told
the
ukrainian
outlet
hromadske
a
financial
pyramid
the
loans
issued
to
shell
companies
linked
to
kolomoisky
and
bogolyubov
eventually
filtered
through
a
bank
in
cyprus
and
to
a
trio
of
associates
in
miami
from
there
the
miami-based
collaborators
helped
set
up
a
number
of
anonymous
companies
across
the
united
states
from
delaware
to
oregon
to
then
begin
a
shopping
spree
in
ohio
all
detailed
in
the
page
document
filed
in
may
the
simplicity
of
it
when
i
read
the
affidavit
that's
what
caught
me
said
john
tobon
an
official
with
homeland
security
investigations
who
has
closely
tracked
foreign
money
laundering
operations
in
the
united
states
it's
pages
of
the
exact
same
thing
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
what
a
shopping
spree
it
was
the
buildings
purchased
included
one
cleveland
center
the
fifth-tallest
building
in
the
city
which
a
company
linked
to
kolomoisky
purchased
for
nearly
million
in
as
well
as
the
aecom
penton
media
building
which
went
for
nearly
million
there
was
also
the
huntington
building
which
sold
for
nearly
million
in
total
as
the
cleveland
scene
wrote
the
real
estate
empire
controlled
million
square
feet
of
downtown
cleveland
commercial
real
estate
just
to
put
it
in
context
some
of
the
buildings
they
reportedly
owned
are
some
marquee
buildings
in
downtown
cleveland
said
gascoigne
who
is
originally
from
northeast
ohio
this
is
some
real
prime
flagship
real
estate
in
downtown
cleveland
they
didn't
just
stop
at
buying
buildings
a
holding
company
linked
to
kolomoisky
snapped
up
a
steel
plant
in
warren
ohio
just
east
of
cleveland
as
the
kyiv
post
wrote
the
plant
was
one
of
kolomoisky's
keystones
in
an
attempt
to
corner
the
global
ferroalloy
market
the
lawsuit
alleges
that
kolomoisky's
network
extended
to
other
similar
companies
ranging
from
west
virginia
to
michigan
to
kentucky
at
the
time
many
in
and
around
cleveland
viewed
the
purchases
as
something
of
a
godsend
given
the
hollowing-out
of
the
city
over
the
past
three
decades
any
revitalization
attempts
were
met
with
open
arms
and
few
questions
along
the
way
kolomoisky's
son
also
began
playing
basketball
for
cleveland
state
university
in
for
instance
the
cleveland
plain-dealer
ran
a
gauzy
piece
on
one
of
kolomoisky's
u.s.
based
associates
chaim
schochet
who
is
also
named
in
the
lawsuit
according
to
the
piece
schochet
was
unlike
any
other
year-old
in
cleveland
working
as
one
of
downtown's
largest
landlords
his
fondness
for
this
city
is
really
apparent
a
senior
vice
president
of
real
estate
for
the
greater
cleveland
partnership
told
the
plain-dealer
and
i
asked
him
why
cleveland
why
now
his
perspective
was
that
it's
a
market
where
acquisition
was
possible
but
also
it
was
really
his
description
of
the
city
he
loves
the
historic
nature
of
the
buildings
the
density
of
the
city
the
lawsuit
though
indicates
otherwise
instead
of
looking
to
cleveland
out
of
fondness
the
lawsuit
alleges
that
schochet
was
a
cog
in
a
sprawling
money
laundering
scheme
nor
does
the
fate
of
the
buildings
linked
to
kolomoisky's
network
indicate
any
kind
of
love
of
the
city's
historic
nature
nor
even
any
kind
of
market
savvy
as
the
cleveland
scene
wrote
in
june
the
kolomoisky
network
has
been
selling
off
its
cleveland
properties
most
of
which
have
fallen
into
disrepair
and
suffer
from
high
vacancy
rates
the
paper
added
that
public
square
is
mired
in
a
situation
of
disrepair
and
vacancy
with
the
value
of
the
building
dropping
by
nearly
half
since
kolomoisky's
network
took
it
over
the
aecom
penton
media
building
likewise
saw
occupancy
rates
plummet
in
the
eight
years
it
was
owned
by
kolomoisky's
network
selling
for
nearly
less
than
the
original
purchase
price
another
purchase
the
huntington
building
is
currently
a
gaping
hole
in
downtown
cleveland
according
to
the
plain-dealer
but
the
warren
steel
plant
fared
potentially
worst
of
all
in
the
plant
announced
it
would
be
closing
entirely
forcing
some
workers
to
lose
their
jobs
in
the
process
even
if
the
details
contained
in
the
lawsuit
prove
untrue
the
story
it
tells
of
a
post-soviet
tycoon
parking
his
money
in
american
real
estate
relying
on
anonymous
shell
companies
and
compliant
realtors
along
the
way
highlights
a
very
real
phenomenon
unfolding
in
the
country
american
officials
have
only
recently
begun
attempting
to
combat
the
proliferation
of
shell-company
purchases
by
kleptocrats
for
decades
any
and
all
american
shell
companies
could
lead
purchases
of
american
real
estate
all
entirely
anonymously
with
no
questions
asked
thanks
to
a
temporary
exemption
that
permitted
realtors
to
skip
steps
necessary
to
check
suspect
funds
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
potentially
dirty
money
cascaded
into
american
markets
ballooning
costs
and
desiccating
neighborhoods
along
the
way
everyone
from
the
iranian
government
to
equatorial
guinea's
dictatorial
ruling
family
took
part
parceling
out
america's
high-end
real
estate
market
keeping
their
money
safe
from
prying
eyes
all
of
it
was
perfectly
legally
and
totally
anonymous
in
the
obama
administration
finally
took
action
spearheading
the
geographic
targeting
orders
gto
program
the
treasury
department's
financial
crimes
enforcement
network
fincen
demanded
information
on
individuals
behind
these
anonymous
financial
vehicles
in
the
three
years
since
the
program
appears
to
have
been
wildly
successful
in
countering
the
flood
of
anonymous
cash
one
study
run
by
researchers
at
the
university
of
miami
and
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
found
that
the
types
of
real
estate
purchases
targeted
by
gtos
had
fallen
some
there
was
one
catch
though
as
these
gtos
were
a
pilot
program
they
applied
only
to
a
handful
of
locations
like
miami
new
york
and
san
antonio
that
range
has
since
expanded
to
cover
cities
like
seattle
las
vegas
and
boston
but
is
by
no
means
nationwide
cleveland
for
example
is
not
covered
and
that
city's
experience
highlights
a
major
loophole
people
behind
these
networks
of
dirty
money
are
simply
moving
to
other
cities
to
clean
their
cash
the
gtos
focus
very
much
on
new
york
miami
places
where
you
expect
people
to
launder
their
money
via
high-end
real
estate
said
aslund
who
analyzed
the
lawsuit
for
the
atlantic
council
but
here
it's
completely
different
this
is
a
different
part
of
the
u.s.
but
the
alleged
operations
linked
to
kolomoisky
also
accent
another
reality
whereas
other
kleptocrats
and
oligarchs
have
often
looked
to
purchase
condos
in
the
united
states
to
live
up
their
lavish
lifestyle
the
purchases
in
cleveland
were
far
more
commercial
all
of
which
opens
up
an
entirely
new
world
of
real
estate
to
potential
questions
about
money
laundering
and
who's
really
behind
the
investments
supposedly
made
to
reinvigorate
downtown
areas
across
the
country
i
think
what
it
does
is
it
brings
forward
a
different
type
of
individual
with
something
else
in
mind
tobon
said
we
haven't
looked
at
companies
that
are
coming
in
to
do
infrastructure
projects
in
a
city
saying
okay
we
are
going
to
revitalize
an
area
all
of
these
development
projects
all
of
these
sales
significant
sales
of
commercial
real
estate
in
important
downtown
areas
that's
where
we
need
to
start
to
focus
on
update
this
story
has
been
updated
to
include
comments
from
a
spokesperson
from
the
optima
group
of
