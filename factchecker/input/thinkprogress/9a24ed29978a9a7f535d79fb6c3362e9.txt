proposed
anti-lgbtq
labor
department
rule
would
let
federal
contractors
discriminate
under
trump
there
has
been
a
propensity
to
use
religious
liberty
to
give
a
license
to
discriminate
the
labor
department
proposed
a
new
rule
wednesday
that
would
allow
broad
religious
exemptions
for
businesses
with
federal
contracts
which
could
undermine
the
rights
of
lgbtq
people
and
other
marginalized
groups
this
could
apply
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
contractors
and
subcontractors
it
applies
to
a
number
of
organizations
such
as
schools
societies
and
corporations
the
rule
says
a
religious
purpose
can
be
shown
by
articles
of
incorporation
or
other
founding
documents
but
that
is
not
the
only
type
of
evidence
that
can
be
used
the
problem
isn't
so
much
that
contractors
will
necessarily
hold
sincerely
religious
beliefs
but
they
will
use
this
as
an
excuse
for
their
homophobia
and
their
transphobia
said
victoria
rodriguez-roldan
senior
policy
counsel
for
the
national
lgbtq
task
force
at
the
task
force
we
are
concerned
and
many
people
of
faith
and
faith-based
communities
that
are
progressive
may
see
this
as
a
problem
several
lgbtq
organizations
and
organizations
focused
on
the
separation
of
church
and
state
attended
meetings
with
office
of
federal

and
the

held
meetings
with
officials
from
may
to
july
about
the
proposed
rule
rodriguez-roldan
said
that
she
met
with
the
director
of
the
ofccp
craig
e.
been
and
that
he
kept
insisting
that
under
ofccp
regulations
gender
identity
and
sexual
orientation
were
still
protected
i
did
say
we
are
aware
but
we
don't
want
any
exceptions
to
them
based
on
religion
she
said
an
august
directive
mentioned
several
u.s.
supreme
court
cases
to
justify
its
guidance
to
ofccp
officials
including
masterpiece
cakeshop
ltd
v
colorado
civil
rights
communication
trinity
lutheran
church
of
columbia
inc
v
comer
and
burwell
v
hobby
lobby
stores
inc
and
recent
executive
orders
in
the
masterpiece
cakeshop
case
in
which
shop
owner
jack
phillips
refused
to
make
a
wedding
cake
for
a
gay
couple
the
court
narrowly
ruled
in
that
the
colorado
civil
rights
communication
did
not
employ
religious
neutrality
when
it
found
that
the
bakery
discriminated
against
the
couple
it
reversed
the
ccrc's
decision
in
the
case
involving
trinity
lutheran
church
the
court
held
in
that
when
a
state
program
denied
a
grant
to
a
religious
school
and
provided
grants
to
non-religious
groups
it
violated
freedom
of
religion
the
court
ruled
in
burwell
v
hobby
lobby
stores
inc
that
closely
held
for-profit
corporations
are
legal
persons
under
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
in
president
donald
trump
released
an
executive
order
on
promoting
free
speech
and
religious
liberty
that
would
guide
the
executive
branch
in
formulating
and
implementing
policies
with
implications
for
the
religious
liberty
of
persons
and
organizations
in
america
in
the
president
established
a
white
house
faith
and
opportunity
initiative
lgbtq
rights
groups
said
they
were
concerned
these
orders
would
weaponize
religious
freedom
rights
to
discriminate
against
lgbtq
people
in
president
barack
obama
signed
an
executive
order
that
amended
two
executive
orders
by
addressing
lgbtq
anti-discrimination
protections
for
federal
employees
trump
said
he
would
not
rescind
it
however
a
justice
department
brief
argued
against
protections
for
queer
workers
in
a
statement
following
news
of
the
rule
m
the
national
center
for
transgender
equality
said
the
regulation
is
another
attempt
to
allow
contractors
to
circumvent
a
executive
order
prohibiting
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
or
gender
identity
by
any
federal
contractor
in
president
trump
weakened
this
rule
by
eliminating
reporting
standards
for
contractors
this
administration
has
clearly
shown
a
propensity
to
use
religious
liberty
to
give
a
license
to
discriminate
said
frank
j.
bewkes
policy
analyst
for
the
lgbt
research
and
communications
project
at
the
center
for
american
progress
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
newsroom
housed
within
the
center
for
american
progress
action
fund
in
an
interview
before
the
proposed
rule
dropped
bewkes
said
he
does
not
see
how
the
cases
mentioned
in
the
directive
would
justify
this
rule
shannon
minter
legal
director
for
the
national
center
for
lesbian
rights
told
into
last
year
that
the
directive
was
contrary
to
established
law
and
said
that
in
the
past
the
department
has
made
it
clear
religious
contractors
can
prefer
members
of
their
religion
but
can't
discriminate
because
of
their
religion
by
eliminating
that
important
qualification
the
new
directive
is
confusing
at
best
and
at
worst
sends
a
dangerous
and
false
message
that
such
discrimination
is
now
permitted
he
said
protections
for
workers
or
prospective
workers
for
federal
contractors
and
subcontractors
are
important
for
the
protection
of
lgbtq
workers
rights
when
there
is
only
a
patchwork
of
employment
protections
on
the
state
level
senate
republicans
refuse
to
consider
the
equality
act
which
would
clarify
and
expand
lgbtq
protections
on
the
national
level
in
employment
housing
and
other
areas
according
to
the
movement
advancement
project
only
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
passed
laws
explicitly
prohibiting
discrimination
and
gender
identity
in
employment
and
housing
the
williams
institute
at
the
ucla
school
of
law
using
gallup
data
estimates
that
of
american
adults
are
lgbtq
among
millennials
identified
as
lgbtq
federal
contractors
are
responsible
for
employing
about
one-fifth
of
the
country's
workforce
bewkes
said
the
rule
could
affect
an
even
larger
number
of
people
this
is
a
huge
number
of
people
this
is
affecting
who
are
lgbtq
workers
and
once
you
consider
religious
exemptions
sometimes
people
use
it
for
other
things
what
if
you're
in
an
interracial
marriage
and
your
employer
disagrees
with
that
on
religious
grounds
bewkes
said
is
that
something
that
is
going
to
be
a
problem
we've
seen
in
south
carolina
with
adoptions
and
religious
exemptions
that
people
are
not
necessarily
turned
away
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
and
identity
they're
being
turned
away
because
their
specific
religion
is
not
the
religion
of
the
agency
bewkes
added
that
this
is
really
an
expansion
of
exemptions
that
already
apply
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
they
are
asking
for
an
expansion
of
that
they're
asking
for
an
exemption
for
anyone
who
is
religiously
affiliated
in
any
way
and
that
opens
up
a
whole
hobby
lobby
issue
and
would
be
very
concerning
the
larger
the
exemption
the
more
undermined
any
nondiscrimination
protection
becomes
because
it's
enforceable
against
fewer
people
it's
just
simple
numbers
what
they're
asking
for
would
be
overly
broad
