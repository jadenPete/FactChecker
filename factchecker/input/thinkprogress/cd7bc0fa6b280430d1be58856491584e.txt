washington
dc
it's
been
a
whirlwind
month
for
year-old
american
tennis
sensation
coco
gauff
the
former
top-ranked
junior
player
who
captured
the
hearts
of
the
sports
world
when
she
became
the
youngest
player
to
ever
qualify
for
the
wimbledon
main
draw
upset
five-time
wimbledon
champion
venus
williams
in
the
first
round
and
then
made
it
all
the
way
to
the
fourth
round
before
falling
to
eventual
champion
simona
halep
this
week
gauff
was
in
the
nation's
capital
where
she
qualified
for
the
main
draw
of
the
wta
event
at
the
citi
open
though
she
lost
in
the
first
round
of
the
tournament
to
zarina
diyas
gauff
got
some
news
right
after
the
loss
that
helped
cheer
her
up
immediately
michelle
obama
wanted
to
meet
her
i
was
surprised
that
she
wanted
me
to
come
to
meet
her
gauff
told
thinkprogress
on
friday
night
after
making
it
to
the
doubles
final
at
the
citi
open
with
fellow
american
teenager
caty
mcnally
i
was
so
nervous
but
she
was
so
nice
obama
and
gauff
met
on
thursday
and
exchanged
gifts
obama
gave
gauff
a
signed
copy
of
her
best-selling
book
becoming
and
gauff
gave
the
former
first
lady
a
signed
tennis
racket
the
two
also
had
a
time
to
talk
about
the
pressures
that
come
with
being
in
the
spotlight
she
just
told
me
to
stay
focused
and
stay
calm
and
that
people
aren't
going
to
like
you
all
the
time
and
the
same
people
that
might
be
cheering
for
you
might
be
the
same
people
that
might
be
pulling
you
down
in
the
future
gauff
said
so
she
just
told
me
just
to
only
care
really
about
the
opinions
of
the
people
who
actually
love
and
care
about
me
gauff
is
new
to
the
spotlight
and
said
she
wanted
to
get
advice
from
someone
who
has
experienced
an
immense
amount
of
scrutiny
and
handled
it
all
with
grace
and
composure
she
was
on
like
one
of
the
biggest
platforms
ever
in
the
world
so
i'm
sure
she's
heard
some
of
the
nastiest
things
gauff
said
i
was
just
kind-of
trying
to
figure
out
how
does
she
handle
that
because
i
think
at
least
from
the
outside
it
seems
tough
on
social
media
gauff
wrote
today
i
got
to
meet
my
idol
michelleobama
her
words
and
wisdom
on
my
journey
will
stay
with
me
on
the
court
over
the
course
of
my
career
she
is
a
true
inspiration
i
have
never
arrived
i
am
always
becoming
thank
you
for
your
time
gauff
admitted
on
friday
that
the
last
few
weeks
have
been
a
whirlwind
but
said
she
is
happy
that
people
are
identifying
with
her
journey
and
that
little
girls
are
looking
up
to
her
i'm
happy
that
they
see
me
as
a
role
model
she
said
and
i
hope
that
i
can
just
be
the
best
role
model
for
them
i'm
still
learning
life
as
well
so
i
guess
they
can
learn
as
well
from
me
