environmental
racism
is
bad
for
your
brain
two
new
books
highlight
how
pollution
is
corrupting
the
bodies
and
minds
of
people
of
color
by
jeremy
deaton
there
are
a
lot
of
explanations
for
the
apparent
gap
in
iq
test
scores
of
white
americans
and
americans
of
color
some
experts
point
to
things
like
bias
in
the
exam
itself
or
the
fact
that
white
students
tend
to
go
to
better-funded
schools
others
tout
racist
myths
take
biologist
james
watson
who
wrongly
claimed
the
black-white
iq
gap
is
genetic
or
writer
jason
richwine
whose
doctoral
dissertation
asserted
that
the
low
average
iq
of
hispanics
is
effectively
permanent
harvard
gave
him
a
phd
for
that
discredited
gem
one
factor
that
is
little
considered
even
by
academics
who
rail
against
racist
stereotypes
is
pollution
and
its
impact
on
the
brain
research
shows
that
contamination
from
cars
planes
power
plants
factories
and
landfills
is
eroding
the
bodies
and
minds
of
black
and
brown
americans
two
new
books
call
attention
to
this
invisible
crisis
intelligence
in
african
americans
and
other
people
of
color
native
americans
hispanics
is
being
assailed
by
the
environment
said
harriet
washington
a
medical
ethicist
and
author
of
a
terrible
thing
to
waste
environmental
racism
and
its
assault
on
the
american
mind
which
investigates
what
pollution
is
doing
to
the
brains
of
people
of
color
we
don't
all
breathe
the
same
air
although
we
would
like
to
think
that
we
do
she
said
african
americans
are
much
more
likely
to
live
in
fence-line
communities
where
they
share
their
neighborhoods
with
toxic
factories
they're
spewing
mercury
they're
spewing
particulate
matter
these
things
directly
affect
the
brain
but
they
also
cause
hypoxia
and
asthma
and
the
hypoxia
over
time
that's
a
lowered
amount
of
oxygen
delivered
to
the
brain
which
can
cause
a
death
of
neurons
and
the
eventual
loss
of
cognition
beth
gardiner
author
of
choked
life
and
breath
in
the
age
of
air
pollution
homed
in
on
this
point
in
her
new
book
one
of
the
things
that
i
found
and
la
was
a
really
good
place
to
see
it
is
there's
kind
of
this
double-stranded
dynamic
with
air
pollution
which
is
that
it
affects
everyone
who
breathes
it
but
it
affects
some
people
more
than
others
she
said
gardiner
described
a
long-term
study
on
pollution
in
southern
california
researchers
found
that
black
and
brown
communities
were
more
likely
to
be
polluted
the
kids
who
grew
up
in
those
communities
were
more
likely
to
have
lifelong
health
problem
such
as
asthma
and
as
washington
mentioned
studies
show
that
asthma
can
affect
processing
speed
attention
learning
and
memory
the
stark
inequality
in
the
air
we
breathe
is
part
of
a
broad
pattern
of
companies
building
factories
power
plants
and
landfills
in
black
and
brown
communities
and
of
public
officials
approving
those
plans
one
fact
that
i
point
out
in
the
book
is
that
a
recent
report
found
that
african
americans
with
an
income
of
to
a
year
solidly
middle
class
are
more
exposed
to
environmental
toxins
than
are
white
people
with
a
year
profoundly
poor
washington
said
describing
the
results
of
a
study
from
the
university
of
colorado
at
boulder
so
it's
race
it's
not
poverty
poverty
is
a
risk
factor
race
is
a
far
larger
one
washington
recalled
when
in
officials
chose
afton
north
carolina
as
the
dumping
site
for
thousands
of
tons
of
soil
contaminated
with
pcbs
toxic
chemicals
linked
with
impaired
brain
function
they
said
afton
was
the
best
site
for
the
landfill
but
they
didn't
cite
any
scientific
studies
washington
said
and
people
in
afton
said
we
know
why
you
picked
us
because
we're
black
you
think
we
won't
fight
back
locals
protested
against
the
dumping
of
pcbs
which
could
seep
into
the
air
or
ooze
into
the
groundwater
hundreds
of
people
were
arrested
they
brought
attention
to
the
dumping
and
in
so
doing
catalyzed
the
environmental
justice
movement
however
they
also
failed
to
stop
the
landfill
showing
how
hard
it
is
to
fight
pollution
it
can
be
difficult
to
prove
that
dumping
was
racially
motivated
and
further
that
it
harmed
the
brain
of
any
one
person
if
i
have
a
heart
attack
tomorrow
or
if
i
lose
someone
i
love
or
if
a
child
suffers
some
sort
of
a
cognitive
impairment
it's
often
very
difficult
except
in
the
most
extreme
cases
to
say
it
was
pollution
gardiner
said
this
fact
helps
protect
polluters
and
so
polluters
are
working
hard
to
make
sure
the
problem
stays
invisible
she
said
gardiner
explained
that
companies
are
working
hard
to
discredit
studies
that
show
how
air
pollution
undermines
public
health
a
phenomenon
she
calls
air
pollution
denial
i
think
we
have
all
become
pretty
accustomed
over
the
last
few
years
or
more
to
this
idea
of
climate
denial
but
what
we've
really
started
to
see
even
more
recently
is
air
pollution
denial
gardiner
said
i
think
that
the
motivation
for
that
is
pretty
clear
it's
because
those
studies
justify
regulation
that
costs
money
to
corporate
polluters
and
if
you
can
cast
doubt
on
some
of
that
science
it's
gonna
make
it
easier
for
you
to
try
to
roll
back
some
of
that
regulation
she
said
that
the
government
needs
to
pay
attention
to
the
research
and
use
it
to
make
good
policy
measures
that
cut
pollution
for
example
help
keep
people
healthy
and
spare
them
costly
hospital
visits
she
pointed
to
studies
showing
that
the
clean
air
act
has
prevented
tens
of
millions
of
asthma
attacks
and
saved
americans
trillions
of
dollars
in
health
care
costs
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
consequential
pieces
of
legislation
in
modern
american
history
gardiner
said
and
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
under-sung
given
its
achievements
and
i
think
that
is
because
of
this
idea
of
invisibility
she
said
that
while
the
clean
air
act
radically
improved
air
quality
a
lot
of
work
remains
to
be
done
so
long
as
lawmakers
fail
to
heed
the
research
on
what
pollution
is
doing
to
american
brains
the
country
as
a
whole
will
feel
it
even
a
small
amount
of
contamination
can
shave
off
iq
points
maybe
just
a
couple
of
points
here
and
there
but
over
years
and
across
the
country
it
starts
to
add
up
what
does
it
mean
nationwide
to
lose
an
average
of
five
iq
points
it
means
that
we
cut
in
half
the
number
of
gifted
children
that
we
gain
millions
and
millions
more
children
who
are
mentally
retarded
washington
said
it's
not
five
iq
points
and
that's
it
it
drags
down
the
achievement
of
a
child
and
the
achievement
of
an
entire
nation
over
time
she
added
we
need
to
act
on
what
we
know
now
i
think
we
have
enough
studies
it's
time
to
actually
come
up
with
policies
that
are
going
to
address
it
