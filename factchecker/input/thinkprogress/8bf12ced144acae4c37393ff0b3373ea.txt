north
korea
keeps
testing
missiles
playing
trump
for
a
fool
pyongyang
is
engaging
in
its
own
maximum
pressure
campaign
north
korean
leader
kim
jong-un
on
wednesday
said
pyongyang's
latest
missile
test
was
an
occasion
to
send
an
adequate
warning
to
the
united
states
and
south
korea
over
the
joint
military
exercises
that
started
this
week
with
the
test
firing
of
what
are
presumed
to
be
ballistic
short-range
missiles
into
the
sea
on
tuesday
north
korea
appears
to
be
embarking
on
its
own
maximum
pressure
campaign
which
at
best
is
aimed
at
bringing
the
trump
administration
back
to
the
negotiating
table
albeit
with
less
stringent
expectations
the
test
came
as
ju
yong
cho
the
country's
envoy
to
the
u.n.
backed
conference
on
disarmament
accused
the
united
sates
of
inciting
military
tension
with
its
joint
military
exercises
with
south
korea
seoul
and
washington
said
ju
can
neither
conceal
nor
whitewash
the
aggressive
nature
of
their
military
drills
he
made
no
mention
of
north
korea's
recent
missile
tests
the
nation's
fourth
in
the
past
two
weeks
will
north
korea's
strategy
to
pressure
the
united
states
to
make
good
on
its
talk
of
negotiation
and
diplomacy
pan
out
and
if
not
what
other
options
does
the
pariah
state
have
north
korea
has
until
now
raised
tensions
in
a
very
calculated
way
doing
enough
to
put
pressure
on
washington
but
not
crossing
lines
that
could
tank
negotiations
and
prompt
a
negative
response
from
the
trump
administration
said
mintaro
oba
a
former
state
department
diplomat
focusing
on
the
koreas
if
the
continuation
of
these
exercises
is
truly
a
huge
problem
for
north
korea
it
can
always
raise
the
stakes
and
undertake
higher-level
provocations
but
otherwise
north
korea
will
continue
to
pressure
washington
by
dragging
its
feet
on
negotiations
and
conducting
lower-level
tests
he
added
trump
at
one
point
unilaterally
promised
to
freeze
the
military
drills
saying
they
were
too
expensive
well
if
you
don't
exercise
with
your
allies
then
you
don't
have
an
alliance
you
have
to
train
together
to
fight
together
said
robert
manning
resident
senior
fellow
at
the
atlantic
council's
scowcroft
center
for
strategy
and
security
whatever
provocations
he
engages
in
kim
will
be
careful
not
to
push
the
envelope
too
far
since
like
president
donald
trump
he
has
what
oba
calls
something
of
a
personal
stake
in
this
diplomatic
process
the
need
for
a
foreign
policy
win
might
be
a
factor
in
trump's
public
responses
to
pyongyang's
provocations
he
has
continually
downplayed
missile
tests
and
ignored
inflammatory
statements
published
in
north
korean
state
media
that
said
manning
is
what
is
behind
north
korea's
bold
moves
in
testing
weapons
not
the
military
drills
which
he
said
north
korea
is
just
using
as
an
excuse
rather
the
president
is
too
invested
in
this
personal
relationship
which
hasn't
gotten
us
a
whole
lot
and
certainly
won't
get
us
a
denuclearized
north
korea
manning
said
trump's
version
of
strategic
patience
is
actually
leading
him
to
make
a
big
mistake
assuring
kim
that
as
long
as
the
status
quo
holds
he
can
continue
developing
his
country's
weapons
systems
until
at
least
the
elections
ignoring
kim's
horrific
human
rights
violations
trump
has
described
an
exchange
of
messages
with
kim
as
beautiful
letters
that
led
to
the
two
men
falling
in
love
he
has
complimented
kim
as
having
tremendous
potential
and
recently
tweeted
about
the
dictator's
beautiful
vision
for
his
country
until
now
the
trump
administration
has
demanded
something
it
calls
complete
denuclearization
though
what
that
means
hasn't
been
clearly
defined
publicly
before
it
lifts
the
sanctions
imposed
on
north
korea
north
korea
wants
a
more
gradual
and
reciprocal
process
scaling
down
some
activities
in
exchange
for
some
sanctions
relief
so
far
calls
for
that
approach
have
found
no
purchase
with
trump
and
his
team
the
first
summit
between
the
u.s.
president
and
the
north
korean
leader
was
held
in
singapore
in
june
amid
much
pomp
and
circumstance
it
yielded
a
brief
vague
agreement
that
produced
neither
a
concrete
consensus
nor
a
roadmap
for
how
to
proceed
a
second
summit
held
in
hanoi
in
february
ended
abruptly
when
u.s.
negotiators
refused
to
lift
any
sanctions
in
exchange
for
concessions
from
north
korea
a
third
meeting
held
at
the
demilitarized
zone
between
north
and
south
korea
in
june
amounted
to
little
more
than
a
cordial
chat
that
lasted
a
little
less
than
an
hour
citing
its
belief
that
trump
was
reneging
on
an
agreement
to
halt
military
drills
with
south
korea
two-and-a-half
weeks
after
the
third
meeting
north
korea
hinted
that
it
might
resume
nuclear
testing
the
north
korean
leader
while
less
prone
to
praising
president
trump
in
any
public
measure
has
used
these
summits
to
showcase
his
political
acumen
after
all
for
a
brief
moment
during
that
third
meeting
president
trump
actually
set
foot
on
north
korean
soil
in
a
way
north
korea
is
using
the
same
hot-and-cold
tactic
as
the
trump
administration
for
instance
trump
started
out
his
relationship
with
kim
with
a
volley
of
threats
and
name-calling
kim
essentially
mirrored
trump's
behavior
as
dialogue
between
the
two
countries
moved
along
u.s.
negotiators
refused
to
budge
even
as
trump
spoke
of
kim
in
favorable
terms
and
north
korea
said
kim
has
been
applying
pressure
with
continued
testing
demonstrating
its
missile
capabilities
and
its
willingness
to
use
them
as
continuing
to
improve
when
not
firing
missiles
kim
uses
a
charm
offensive
designed
to
create
a
public
narrative
where
north
korea
is
acting
in
good
faith
and
the
united
states
is
the
obstacle
to
diplomatic
progress
but
the
fact
is
things
have
come
to
a
screeching
halt
at
least
for
now
i
think
they're
playing
trump
for
a
fool
said
manning
he
kim
realizes
he
can
do
most
of
what
he
wants
without
paying
any
price
for
it
and
he
wants
to
keep
the
hope
alive
for
negotiations
he
added
like
kim
president
trump
has
largely
used
these
summits
as
photo
ops
to
advance
his
talking
points
and
to
show
that
he
has
made
progress
despite
the
best
efforts
of
u.s.
north
korea
envoy
stephen
biegun
nailing
down
further
negotiations
with
pyongyang
has
proven
to
be
difficult
currently
what
vestiges
of
negotiations
remain
are
driven
by
kim
trump
and
their
cults
of
personality
the
only
noteworthy
by-product
of
this
process
has
been
the
manufacture
of
kitschy
memorabilia
pyongyang
has
issued
commemorative
stamps
of
the
first
and
third
meeting
perhaps
the
second
one
was
too
disastrous
to
memorialize
the
trump
administration
created
a
coin
in
honor
of
the
singapore
summit
but
mistakenly
referred
to
kim
as
north
korea's
supreme
leader
which
is
actually
the
title
of
iran's
leader
no
matter
what
kind
of
love
or
hate
flows
between
kim
and
trump
it's
south
korea
that
rests
directly
in
its
neighbor's
line
of
fire
and
while
these
short-range
missiles
don't
seem
to
trouble
the
u.s.
president
who
still
tweets
compliments
to
kim
seoul
is
less
sanguine
about
these
developments
the
associated
press
reported
on
tuesday
that
south
korean
chief
national
security
adviser
chung
eui-yong
held
an
emergency
meeting
to
discuss
the
missile
tests
with
the
country's
defense
minister
and
spy
chief
for
now
south
korea
is
paying
more
for
the
military
drills
as
president
trump
boasted
on
wednesday
seoul
meanwhile
continues
to
face
the
reality
that
it
is
directly
within
the
path
of
the
short-range
missiles
pyongyang
continues
to
test
