trump
administration
sows
chaos
by
wrongly
implying
kids
born
overseas
might
not
be
citizens
for
obvious
reasons
the
policy
change
seemed
like
an
attack
on
birthright
citizenship
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
uscis
has
been
frantically
trying
to
correct
reports
about
a
new
policy
change
announced
wednesday
the
policy
seemed
to
suggest
that
children
born
to
u.s.
citizens
in
other
countries
would
no
longer
be
considered
citizens
themselves
but
that's
not
exactly
what
uscis
meant
to
convey
the
policy
announced
wednesday
only
impacts
the
children
of
those
working
for
the
u.s.
government
or
military
who
are
not
citizens
themselves
that
clarification
was
missing
from
the
page
memo
the
agency
originally
released
causing
many
to
believe
that
even
american
citizens
would
have
to
apply
for
their
children
to
receive
citizenship
uscis
put
out
an
additional
statement
later
on
wednesday
assuring
that
citizens
were
mostly
not
impacted
uscis
acting
director
ken
cuccinelli
also
tweeted
out
his
own
clarification
that
no
changes
have
been
made
to
citizenship
it's
not
hard
to
see
however
why
some
people
were
freaking
out
about
the
policy
as
it
was
originally
announced
earlier
this
summer
immigration
attorneys
reported
hearing
that
the
trump
administration
wanted
to
end
the
policy
that
lets
the
family
members
of
non-citizen
service
members
apply
for
a
green
card
and
stay
in
the
country
in
other
words
that
would
mean
that
somebody
could
be
serving
in
the
u.s.
military
abroad
while
their
family
back
home
is
being
deported
the
policy
also
came
just
a
week
after
trump
said
he
is
seriously
considering
ending
birthright
citizenship
the
constitutional
guarantee
that
anybody
born
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states
is
a
u.s.
citizen
taking
away
citizenship
from
the
children
of
u.s.
citizens
simply
for
being
born
abroad
would
be
a
step
toward
dismantling
that
protection
moreover
the
policy
may
still
have
consequences
for
u.s.
couples
adopting
children
from
overseas
several
cases
involving
same-sex
couples
who've
had
children
abroad
speak
to
how
the
administration
is
using
homophobia
as
an
excuse
to
similarly
undermine
citizenship
expectations
two
different
same-sex
couples
are
currently
in
legal
fights
with
the
state
department
because
their
children
born
abroad
haven't
been
recognized
as
citizens
in
one
case
a
married
same-sex
couple
from
georgia
had
a
child
via
a
surrogate
in
england
they
are
both
u.s.
citizens
and
both
listed
as
the
parents
on
the
birth
certificate
but
because
they're
a
same-sex
couple
and
their
daughter
is
not
biologically
related
to
either
of
them
the
child
was
considered
born
out
of
wedlock
and
the
state
department
refused
to
grant
her
u.s.
citizenship
in
another
case
earlier
this
year
a
married
same-sex
couple
tried
to
bring
their
newborn
twins
into
the
country
after
they
were
born
to
a
surrogate
in
canada
but
only
one
of
them
was
granted
citizenship
that's
because
only
one
of
the
men
in
the
couple
is
a
u.s.
citizen
and
the
twins
were
conceived
using
both
of
their
sperm
so
the
child
of
the
israeli
citizen
was
not
considered
a
u.s.
citizen
because
he
wasn't
related
by
blood
to
his
u.s.
citizen
father
a
federal
judge
ruled
earlier
this
year
that
both
children
should
have
been
recognized
as
citizens
but
the
administration
is
still
appealing
this
case
in
court
nothing
in
the
law
requires
that
children
of
married
u.s.
citizens
have
a
biological
connection
to
their
parents
but
the
administration
has
seemingly
chosen
to
apply
that
rule
of
its
own
accord
erasing
the
validity
of
same-sex
marriages
in
the
process
the
new
rule
speaks
to
another
arbitrary
attempt
to
limit
citizenship
to
those
born
abroad
this
week's
policy
may
not
have
had
as
big
an
impact
as
was
first
believed
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
reminder
that
the
administration
is
looking
for
every
possible
opportunity
to
limit
access
to
anybody
it
might
perceive
as
a
foreigner
