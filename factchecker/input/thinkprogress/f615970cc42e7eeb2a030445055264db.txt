at
president

behest

fox
news

admitted
that
he
is
completely
unqualified
for
this
job

about
his
dancing
ability
spicer
who
hardly
meets
any
of
the
definitions
of
the
word
star
conceded
he
has
none
are
you
a
good
dancer
a
fox
friends
host
asked
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
no
spicer
conceded
horrible
dancer
according
to
variety
spicer
will
be
paid
at
least
for
his
appearances
spicer
who
currently
is
the
spokesman
for
a
pro-trump
super
pac
spent
much
of
his
tenure
as
trump's
top
spokesman
making
the
case
that
qualifications
were
important
he
demanded
democrats
in
the
senate
confirm
neil
gorsuch
for
the
supreme
court
seat
that
sen
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
kept
open
for
more
than
a
year
because
he
was
an
unquestionably
qualified
nominee
he
complained
when
they
delayed
votes
on
president
trump's
unquestionably
qualified
and
talented
group
of
cabinet
nominees
he
blasted
trump's
selection
of
anthony
scaramucci
to
be
white
house
communications
director
saying
i
just
didn't
feel
as
if
he
had
the
qualifications
or
background
to
work
in
the
communications
office
tom
bergeron
the
longtime
dancing
with
the
stars
host
tweeted
on
wednesday
that
he
was
not
thrilled
with
spicer's
selection
wishing
that
the
show
could
provide
a
joyful
respite
from
our
exhausting
political
climate
and
free
of
inevitably
divisive
bookings
from
any
party
affiliations
spicer
responded
that
he
was
going
on
to
bring
people
together
this
should
be
two
hours
of
politics-free
but
more
than
that
and
i
hope
what
this
show
is
at
the
end
of
the
season
is
an
example
of
people
of
a
bunch
of
different
backgrounds
getting
together
leaving
politics
aside
and
having
a
good
time
in
a
civil
and
respectful
way
and
so
my
hope
and
goal
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
season
tom
looks
back
and
says
you
know
what
we
need
more
of
this
not
less
of
it
he
explained
we
need
more
bringing
people
together
of
different
backgrounds
and
saying
hey
come
together
show
how
much
you
actually
can
enjoy
each
other's
company
have
a
conversation
be
together
dance
around
enjoy
each
other
because
i
think
too
much
of
what
we
have
in
this
country
right
now
is
every
conversation
has
to
turn
into
politics
spicer's
attempts
to
unite
the
nation
include
continuing
to
defend
a
racist
president
who
just
this
week
called
jewish
democrats
disloyal
and
serving
as
spokesman
for
america
first
action
superpac
a
pro-trump
political
group
whose
about
page
begins
for
eight
long
years
america
was
held
hostage
by
an
administration
where
our
hopes
dreams
and
values
were
sold
piece
by
piece
winning
became
a
bad
word
and
apologies
the
norm
fox
friends
co-host
ainsley
earhardt
defended
spicer's
inclusion
on
the
show
arguing
there
are
a
lot
of
trump
supporters
and
they
deserve
to
get
to
see
one
of
them
dance
badly
on
television
i
hate
that
bergeron
got
political
fifty
percent
of
the
country
is
going
to
be
watching
and
they
are
conservative
and
they
support
this
president
and
this
administration
earhardt
said
the
latest
fox
news
poll
found
that
just
of
americans
approve
of
trump
compared
to
who
disapprove
true
to
form
spicer
did
not
correct
earhardt's
demonstrably
inflated
numbers
