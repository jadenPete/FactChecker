threatening
to
attack
jewish
community

it's
the
latest

a
slew
of
far-right
threats
but
the
white
house's
attention
is
naturally
elsewhere

seamus
o'rearedon
new
middletown
police
chief
vincent
d'egidio
said
that
the
post
as
well
as
reardon's
other
social
media
activity
which
was
allegedly
filled
with
racist
slurs
and
comments
kicked
off
a
very
rapidly
evolving
investigation
this
is
a
person
that
has
declared
himself
as
a
white
nationalist
d'egidio
said
with
the
hate
crimes
and
everything
else
going
on
we
want
to
make
sure
we
do
our
part
to
make
sure
this
person
was
taken
off
the
streets
very
quickly
police
and
the
fbi
raided
reardon's
house
on
friday
where
they
recovered
several
weapons
including
at
least
two
ar-
s
as
well
as
ammunition
a
gas
mask
and
body
armor
he
has
been
charged
with
harassment
and
aggravated
menacing
and
was
held
on
bond
his
court
appearance
was
scheduled
for
monday
morning
reardon
was
just
one
of
three
young
men
arrested
in
the
last
week
for
plotting
to
launch
separate
mass
attacks
on
friday
police
in
florida
arrested
year-old
tristan
scott
wix
after
he
told
his
former
girlfriend
that
he
planned
to
open
fire
on
a
large
crowd
the
day
beforehand
police
and
federal
agents
in
connecticut
arrested
year-old
brandon
wagshol
for
attempting
to
import
high-capacity
rifle
magazines
into
the
state
like
reardon
wagshol's
social
media
was
filled
with
racist
and
homophobic
rhetoric
and
earlier
this
month
another
white
supremacist
was
arrested
in
florida
for
plotting
to
attack
a
walmart
in
the
days
for
following
the
far-right
mass
shooting
in
el
paso
texas
while
the
precise
motivations
for
each
of
these
would-be
attackers
differs
the
uptick
in
threats
after
the
el
paso
mass
shooting
earlier
this
month
shows
that
as
thinkprogress
has
previously
reported
the
motivations
and
tactical
advice
of
previous
mass
shooters
who
have
publicly
announced
their
intentions
online
often
help
to
inspire
others
and
accelerate
the
rate
of
attacks
this
memeticization
of
far-right
attacks
and
attackers
isn't
confined
to
the
united
states
earlier
in
august
a
year-old
norwegian
man
posted
online
his
intent
to
attack
a
mosque
before
opening
fire
on
the
al-noor
islamic
center
near
oslo
the
attack
was
stopped
after
a
year-old
retired
pakistani
air
force
officer
tackled
the
shooter
preventing
any
serious
injuries
the
oslo
shooter
had
allegedly
cited
white
nationalist
terrorist
anders
behring
breivik
as
his
inspiration
for
the
attack
according
to
police
the
far-right
attack
in
el
paso
earlier
this
month
in
which
the
shooter
allegedly
targeted
mexicans
and
complained
of
an
invasion
of
immigrants
has
led
to
a
flurry
of
calls
including
from
some
conservative
outlets
for
the
federal
government
to
step
up
the
fight
against
white
nationalism
president
donald
trump
however
has
remained
focused
on
the
so-called
threat
from
anti-fascist
demonstrators
and
other
counter-protest
groups
ahead
of
a
far-right
rally
in
portland
over
the
weekend
for
instance
trump
paid
no
mind
to
the
white
nationalist
groups
descending
on
the
city
instead
focusing
on
antifa
major
consideration
is
being
given
to
naming
antifa
an
organization
of
terror
he
tweeted
portland
is
being
watched
very
closely
it
was
the
second
time
he
threatened
to
target
anti-fascist
protesters
and
not
the
white
supremacists
they
oppose
counselor
to
the
president
kellyanne
conway
also
tried
to
equate
white
nationalist
domestic
terrorists
with
antifa
during
an
interview
on
fox
friends
monday
morning
fbi
director
chris
wray
made
very
clear
that
their
arrests
based
on
domestic
terrorism
are
up
now
this
includes
white
supremacy
also
includes
antifa
and
it
can
also
include
anti-semitism
she
said
if
you
roll
the
tape
you
see
what
antifa
are
doing
she
added
they're
not
just
taunting
they're
physically
violent
they're
hurting
people
