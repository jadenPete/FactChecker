it's
not
just
cities
president
trump
there's
economic
hardship
in
rural
america
too
the
president
has
been
quick
to
condemn
urban
america's
problems
but
he
has
ignored
similar
issues
that
afflict
his
supporters
in
rural
communities
donald
trump
elicited
sensational
headlines
with
his
broadside
about
baltimore
labeling
the
city
a
disgusting
rat
and
rodent
infested
mess
where
no
human
being
would
want
to
live
despite
his
racist
politically
motivated
complaints
about
poverty
crime
and
social
disorder
in
urban
america
the
president
has
yet
to
draw
similar
attention
to
equal
or
worse
conditions
in
rural
america
and
it's
unlikely
he
ever
will
that's
because
for
all
the
woes
afflicting
the
out-of-sight
pockets
of
impoverished
southern
and
midwestern
states
trump's
most
faithful
white
supporters
live
there
often
in
greater
distress
than
the
urban
black
residents
in
communities
he
so
bitterly
condemned
olugbenga
ajilore
a
senior
economist
at
the
center
for
american
progress
emphasizes
this
point
in
an
illuminating
study
this
week
that
urged
policymakers
to
pay
greater
attention
to
the
plight
of
black
americans
in
rural
communities
thinkprogress
is
an
editorially
independent
project
of
the
center
for
american
progress
action
fund
arguing
that
politicians
like
trump
tend
to
equate
poverty
in
the
united
states
with
black
people
living
in
chicago
newark
n.j.
washington
d.c.
and
other
metropolitan
areas
with
large
and
highly
visible
minority
populations
ajilore
notes
that
black
people
are
less
noticed
across
rural
america
but
they
are
there
struggling
no
less
than
their
relatives
in
the
big
cities
yet
ajilore
observes
that
when
political
leaders
speak
of
hard
times
in
rural
america
they
seemingly
only
focus
on
these
areas
white
residents
neglecting
the
fact
that
they
are
home
to
a
significant
number
of
african
americans
drawing
upon
data
contained
in
the
american
community
survey
ajilore
calculates
that
african
americans
make
up
of
the
nation's
overall
population
and
comprise
of
the
population
in
southern
nonmetropolitan
counties
but
poverty
and
social
distress
doesn't
respect
geographic
boundaries
or
racial
identity
james
ziliak
director
of
the
centenaries
for
poverty
research
at
the
university
of
kentucky
believes
the
nation's
rural
communities
are
suffering
more
than
cities
things
are
worrisome
in
rural
areas
ziliak
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
philadelphia
inquirer
jobs
aren't
being
created
there
at
the
same
rates
as
in
urban
centers
and
whatever
jobs
there
are
tend
to
be
low-wage
of
the
nation's
poorest
states
are
in
the
south
according
to
a
compilation
of
federal
statistics
by
world
atlas
still
of
the
poorest
states
supported
trump
in
the
election
what's
more
a
recent
usa
today
listing
of
the
poorest
towns
in
the
united
states
with
poverty
rates
as
high
as
of
them
are
in
states
that
voted
for
trump
and
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
in
southern
states
so
it's
little
wonder
that
trump
is
loath
to
criticize
white
people
living
in
the
heartland
of
his
political
support
however
the
president
and
his
supporters
show
little
inhibition
about
attacking
people
whom
they
perceive
as
antagonistic
to
his
political
views
to
be
sure
the
language
and
narrative
that
trump
and
other
conservative
politicians
and
policymakers
employ
tends
to
set
apart
minority
populations
and
undermine
public
support
for
addressing
deep
social
ills
even
the
nomenclature
of
public
policy
employs
race-neutral
euphemisms
to
signal
what
harvard
university
sociologist
mich
le
lamont
calls
symbolic
boundaries
to
isolate
and
protect
white
americans
from
the
effects
of
multiculturalism
and
globalization
in
studying
trump's
speeches
lamont
found
that
he
repeatedly
talked
about
separating
people
using
solid
protective
structures
such
as
building
a
wall
between
the
u.s.
and
mexico
and
demonizing
minorities
to
engender
support
for
physical
barriers
trump's
electoral
speeches
also
appealed
to
the
white
working
class
because
they
were
a
vehicle
for
boundary
work
toward
groups
that
white
working
class
men
typically
view
as
inferior
to
or
below
them
immigrants
african
americans
and
hispanic
americans
and
women
and
lgbtq
people
lamont
wrote
in
an
abstract
published
in
the
november
edition
of
the
british
journal
of
sociology
thus
trump's
speeches
performed
as
speech
acts
that
affirmed
workers
superior
standing
and
symbolically
raised
their
status
in
relation
to
these
groups
by
scapegoating
the
people
who
live
in
urban
areas
with
often
wildly
inaccurate
and
frightening
descriptions
trump
distorts
public
understanding
of
the
serious
and
persistent
problems
afflicting
poor
americans
of
all
races
worse
it
builds
resentment
and
anger
toward
any
effort
to
alleviate
the
causes
of
poverty
he's
talking
about
cities
and
urban
areas
and
using
it
as
a
proxy
for
minorities
cornell
belcher
a
washington
d.c.
based
pollster
for
democratic
candidates
and
issues
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
los
angeles
times
he's
pretending
to
be
benevolent
but
he's
locking
in
the
stereotype
that
these
people
need
us
to
take
care
of
them
those
people
can't
govern
themselves
it's
this
white
savior
idea
that
is
as
fundamentally
and
historically
racist
as
it
comes
in
this
country
the
idea
that
people
of
color
need
to
be
saved
by
the
white
man
ajilore
told
thinkprogress
that
there's
a
misperception
that
rural
americans
are
like
the
american
gothic
a
white
farmer
on
a
tractor
not
that
it
is
diverse
with
african
americans
lgbt
people
people
with
disabilities
and
all
the
other
people
who
are
a
part
of
the
nation
given
the
broad
diversity
of
people
living
in
rural
america
ajilore
said
his
prescription
for
improving
outcomes
for
black
americans
were
broad
enough
to
help
anyone
who
lives
in
the
region
among
his
recommendations
are
raising
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
an
hour
garnering
support
for
greater
unionization
in
southern
states
and
encouraging
increased
voter
participation
in
rural
communities
by
removing
structural
barriers
that
limit
voting
rights
what
i'm
talking
about
doesn't
only
help
black
people
he
said
it
helps
everybody
