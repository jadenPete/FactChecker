d
signed
the
legislation
into
law
on
friday
the
bill
which
passed
the
house
in
march
and
the
senate
in
may
would
amend
the
school
code
to
ensure
public
schools
teach
about
the
the
roles
and
contributions
of
lesbian
gay
bisexual
and
transgender
people
in
u.s.
and
state
history
the
measure
provides
for
textbooks
in
public
schools
that
include
the
roles
and
contributions
of
all
people
protected
under
the
illinois
human
rights
act
and
mandates
that
they
be
non-discriminatory
toward
those
groups
queer
trans
and
nonbinary
people
are
protected
under
state
law
lawmakers
who
supported
the
bill
say
that
lgbtq-inclusive
curricula
will
not
only
provide
a
more
accurate
telling
of
history
but
will
work
against
transphobia
and
queerphobia
and
help
lgbtq
students
feel
more
welcome
at
school

as
someone
who
grew
up
in
a
small
town
and

a
sponsor

the
bill
said
on
her
website
one
of
the
best
ways
to
overcome
intolerance
is
through
education
and
exposure
to
different
people
and
viewpoints
it
is
my
hope
that
teaching
students
about
the
valuable
contributions
lgbtq
individuals
have
made
throughout
history
will
create
a
safer
environment
with
fewer
incidents
of
harassment
the
gay
lesbian
straight
education
network
glsen
s
school
climate
report
found
that
school-based
supports
such
as
lgbtq-inclusive
curricula
gay-straight
alliances
which
are
student
organizations
to
promote
lgbtq-friendly
environments
in
schools
and
lgbtq-supportive
school
staff
continue
to
have
a
positive
effect
on
school
climate
but
often
these
supports
are
not
available
to
students
a
majority
of
students
in
the
survey
said
their
classes
did
not
include
representations
of
lgbtq
people
history
or
events
in
lessons
brenda
barron
director
of
public
policy
at
glsen
told
thinkprogress
in
a
statement
all
students
deserve
to
see
their
lives
and
experiences
reflected
at
school
we
applaud
governor
pritzker's
signing
of
legislation
that
makes
sure
that
students
including
lgbtq
students
are
reflected
in
the
curriculum
throughout
illinois
we
look
forward
to
resources
and
funding
being
allocated
toward
supporting
this
important
goal
of
making
illinois
public
schools
more
inclusive
the
bill
had
opposition
from
some
republican
lawmakers
and
conservative
groups
which
claimed
that
legislation
ensuring
that
lgbtq
people
are
included
in
the
curricula
would
politicize
history
lessons
and
could
be
age
inappropriate
the
illinois
family
institute
said
the
legislation
would
politicize
curricula
in
order
to
advance
biased
beliefs
about
sexuality
to
children
illinois
rep
darren
bailey
r
said
forcing
that
information
on
five
year-olds
and
elementary
school
children
is
more
of
an
effort
of
indoctrination
than
of
learning
history
about
individuals
who
accomplished
important
discoveries
in
science
or
created
great
works
of

the
state's

not
promote

lifestyle
some
arizona
teachers
said
the
effect
of
the
law
was
broader
than
hiv
aids
instruction
and
fostered
fear
