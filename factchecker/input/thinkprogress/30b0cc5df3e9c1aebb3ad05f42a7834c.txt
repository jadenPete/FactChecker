white
supremacists
look
to
remake
the
map
of
america
after
el
paso
the
trend
is
clearly
pointing
in
a
disturbing
direction
when
dylann
roof
the
white
supremacist
terrorist
behind
the
charleston
massacre
issued
his
manifesto
he
did
so
with
a
specific
vision
of
america
in
mind
to
roof's
mind
the
united
states
was
his
country
a
white
man's
nation
worth
reclaiming
through
horrid
bloodshed
done
in
the
name
of
racial
supremacy
to
roof
white
supremacists
could
still
conquer
their
country
even
if
they
made
up
only
a
fraction
of
the
population
ideas
that
white
people
in
america
should
pack
up
and
relocate
elsewhere
were
ludicrous
to
roof
movements
to
cleave
part
of
the
country
say
the
pacific
northwest
into
a
whites-only
utopia
were
anathema
to
roof's
endgame
i
think
this
idea
is
beyond
stupid
why
should
i
for
example
give
up
the
beauty
and
history
of
south
carolina
roof
claimed
the
whole
idea
is
pathetic
and
just
another
way
to
run
from
the
problem
without
facing
it
fast
forward
four
years
to
last
weekend
in
el
paso
texas
a
white
supremacist
picked
up
where
roof
left
off
in
a
reprise
of
the
charleston
shooter's
slaughter
the
alleged
el
paso
shooter
murdered
some
individuals
at
a
local
wal-mart
all
in
the
name
of
white
nationalism
a
manifesto
purportedly
written
by
the
shooter
lays
out
his
extremism
how
he
was
specifically
targeting
hispanics
how
his
massacre
would
help
prevent
texas
from
becoming
a
democratic
stronghold
how
he
aimed
to
end
racial
mixing
the
alleged
el
paso
manifesto
however
carries
a
different
vision
for
an
american
future
than
that
pushed
by
roof
one
overlooked
in
the
days
following
the
attack
and
one
that
may
portend
a
growing
shift
in
the
end-goals
of
white
supremacist
extremists
to
the
shooter
america
was
in
a
sense
beyond
saving
instead
the
shooter
wrote
the
country
must
fracture
entirely
in
the
shooter's
vision
there
would
be
no
more
united
states
in
its
place
would
be
an
america
divide
d
into
a
confederacy
of
territories
with
at
least
territory
for
each
race
such
a
proposal
would
apparently
allow
each
race
self-determination
within
their
respective
territory
s
sic
contra
roof
the
alleged
el
paso
shooter
wanted
to
be
done
with
the
united
states
to
him
there
was
no
u.s.
to
reclaim
instead
it
should
be
scrapped
entirely
it
sounds
like
they're
borrowing
past
ideas
and
putting
renewed
emphasis
on
it
daryl
johnson
a
former
department
of
homeland
security
official
focused
on
monitoring
the
far-right
told
thinkprogress
it's
getting
new
traction
if
these
guys
are
quoting
it
in
their
manifestos
while
the
idea
of
breaking
the
united
states
into
separate
racial
territories
is
of
course
ludicrous
it
doesn't
come
without
support
and
if
anything
that
support
is
growing
with
flames
fanned
by
actors
both
foreign
and
domestic
american
state
fracture
breaking
up
the
country
outright
has
gained
increasing
credence
among
the
far-right
over
the
past
few
years
and
with
last
weekend's
terrorist
attack
the
domestic
push
to
dissolve
the
united
states
outright
entered
a
new
phase
one
whose
end
remains
unclear
the
record
of
attempts
to
break
the
country
into
racial
regions
has
of
course
a
lengthy
history
andrew
jackson's
administration
for
instance
pushed
the
notion
of
creating
a
western
territory
peopled
solely
with
native
americans
many
of
whom
would
be
ethnically
cleansed
from
the
american
southeast
by
both
jackson
and
his
successor
martin
van
buren
to
the
jackson
administration
the
territory
would
eventually
gain
statehood
outright
a
state
populated
by
and
for
the
indigenous
nations
conquered
through
america's
white
supremacist
expansionism
the
proposal
crumbled
in
the
face
of
congressional
pushback
indeed
the
root
for
such
a
race-based
division
largely
took
place
in
the
american
west
oregon
celebrated
its
ascension
to
statehood
with
a
constitution
barring
any
black
settlement
outright
anti-chinese
pogroms
in
nevada
and
idaho
and
wyoming
aimed
to
drive
competing
non-white
laborers
from
the
territories
as
did
anti-south
asian
riots
in
washington
state
genocidal
massacres
of
indigenous
nations
in
california
in
the
mid-
th
century
against
wintus
against
pomos
against
tolowas
achieved
much
the
same
all
in
the
name
of
forcing
non-whites
from
newly
american
territory
and
texas
was
no
different
with
texas
rangers
responsible
for
much
of
the
attempts
at
ethnic
cleansing
along
the
texas-mexico
border
of
course
it's
not
as
if
the
american
west
had
a
monopoly
on
these
platforms
of
ethnic
cleansing
or
of
racial
reorganization
post-civil
war
white
supremacist
terrorism
in
the
u.s.
lynchings
armed
uprisings
political
violence
aimed
at
driving
formerly
enslaved
populations
and
their
descendants
from
the
american
south
one
of
the
primary
drivers
behind
the
great
migration
itself
part
economic
exodus
and
part
refugee
movement
but
for
decades
the
idea
of
breaking
the
u.s.
into
racial
regions
was
a
fringe
fantasy
white
supremacists
from
the
ku
klux
klan
to
white
nationalist
extremists
in
the
militia
movement
wanted
a
return
to
white
racial
hegemony
across
the
entirety
of
the
united
states
ideas
of
a
whites-only
nation-state
started
resurfacing
in
the
s
and
s
according
to
johnson
and
percolated
especially
in
the
pacific
northwest
but
only
a
small
minority
of
extremists
shared
these
views
such
was
the
idea
roof
ridiculed
in
his
manifesto
over
the
past
few
years
though
the
notion
of
state
fracture
and
racial
reorganization
may
have
gained
credence
among
far-right
voices
and
backers
have
been
finding
support
from
the
highest
ranks
of
the
american
government
the
recent
interest
in
creating
a
whites-only
state
within
the
u.s.
can
be
seen
in
a
selection
in
terminology
whereas
white
supremacists
claim
precisely
what
their
name
implies
the
supremacy
of
the
white
race
however
they
define
it
white
nationalists
often
fall
back
on
myopic
claims
that
they
are
in
fact
not
racist
but
simply
prefer
people
of
the
white
race
to
others
these
claims
are
belied
by
the
fact
that
the
most
prominent
white
nationalists
of
the
past
few
years
richard
spencer
matthew
heimbach
and
the
like
also
happen
to
be
inveterate
anti-semites
who
regularly
spew
racist
diatribes
and
clearly
use
the
term
white
nationalist
as
a
linguistic
defense
against
their
own
white
supremacy
but
it's
also
true
that
there
appears
more
interest
over
the
past
few
years
on
the
far-right
in
the
interest
of
unwinding
the
u.s.
entirely
an
interest
that
culminated
in
a
massacre
in
el
paso
last
weekend
take
heimbach
while
the
former
head
of
the
traditionalist
workers
party
has
transformed
into
a
laughingstock
after
being
arrested
for
an
altercation
with
his
step-father-in-law
after
sleeping
with
the
man's
wife
heimbach's
step-mother-in-law
he
gained
notoriety
in
as
one
of
the
faces
of
a
rising
generation
of
white
supremacists
to
heimbach
the
solution
to
america's
ails
was
simple
balkanization
every
ethnic
group
should
be
able
to
opt
out
of
multiculturalism
if
it
wants
to
heimbach
said
multiculturalism
leads
to
violence
multiculturalism
leads
to
disunity
different
cultures
want
to
live
differently
spencer
likewise
echoed
heimbach
another
prominent
face
of
the
fascists
who
rose
to
prominence
in
spencer
accused
of
domestic
abuse
to
go
along
with
his
white
supremacy
has
advocated
the
creation
of
a
white
ethno-state
while
spencer
hasn't
specified
where
such
a
state
would
exist
one
of
his
allies
former
kkk
lawyer
sam
dickson
fleshed
out
spencer's
idea
in
late
as
the
southern
poverty
law
center
related
dickson
claimed
african
americans
could
be
given
manhattan
describing
his
version
of
a
balkanization
of
america
other
semi-prominent
extreme
right
voices
have
picked
up
the
threads
since
patrick
little
another
anti-semitic
white
supremacist
announced
in
that
he
supported
the
balkanization
of
the
u.s.
i'm
a
fan
of
balkanization
little
claimed
the
backing
of
balkanization
fits
into
broader
trends
of
american
white
supremacists
looking
to
the
dissolution
of
yugoslavia
and
the
kind
of
ethnic
cleansing
resultant
for
inspiration
former
president
barack
obama
specifically
pointed
to
ethnic
cleansing
in
the
balkans
in
his
statement
following
the
el
paso
shooting
and
just
this
week
the
splc
outed
a
state
department
official
named
matthew
gebert
as
a
white
supremacist
one
who
claimed
white
americans
need
a
new
country
one
that
could
boast
its
own
nuclear
arsenal
that's
all
we
need
gebert
said
we
need
a
country
founded
for
white
people
with
a
nuclear
deterrent
and
you
watch
how
the
world
trembles
having
someone
as
outwardly
racist
and
sympathetic
to
white
nationalist
rhetoric
in
power
as
president
trump
in
some
ways
mitigates
the
push
for
outright
state
fracture
so
long
as
trump
remains
ensconced
in
washington
the
ludicrous
notion
of
territorial
reordering
in
the
united
states
remains
at
bay
i
don't
think
they've
thought
about
the
structure
of
an
all-white
society
johnson
told
thinkprogress
it's
this
idealistic
utopia
and
they
don't
sit
there
and
say
well
how
are
we
going
to
govern
how
are
we
going
to
tax
things
like
that
but
that
doesn't
mean
things
can't
change
or
that
trump
himself
wouldn't
be
sympathetic
to
the
movement
at
some
point
in
the
future
after
all
just
this
week
trump
took
to
twitter
to
boost
a
fired
google
employee
the
man
trump
publicly
praised
also
happened
to
be
a
vocal
supporter
of
richard
spencer
nor
is
this
swelling
white
supremacist
push
for
the
disintegration
of
the
country
which
spilled
into
bloodshed
in
texas
last
weekend
purely
of
domestic
interest
look
at
recent
russian
interference
efforts
not
only
have
kremlin-funded
groups
previously
cultivated
ties
with
neo-confederates
in
the
u.s.
but
some
of
the
most
prominent
fake
social
media
accounts
specifically
and
successfully
targeted
secessionists
with
racist
rhetoric
through
and
after
the
election
american
secessionists
also
happened
to
flock
to
moscow
before
the
vote
just
a
few
months
ago
we
learned
of
an
aborted
plan
to
try
to
stoke
racial
discontent
with
the
ultimate
aim
of
cracking
apart
the
nation
into
racial
polities
regardless
of
whether
or
not
these
plans
are
an
amateurish
thought
experiment
the
fact
that
these
people
are
talking
about
doing
this
should
disturb
americans
of
all
stripes
a
former
assistant
director
of
counterintelligence
at
the
fbi
told
nbc
elsewhere
rhetoric
advocating
the
fracturing
of
america
has
begun
to
seep
beyond
just
white
supremacist
messaging
far-right
pundits
like
kurt
schlichter
and
jesse
kelly
who
claim
to
be
patriots
have
floated
the
idea
of
destroying
the
united
states
kelly
claimed
he
wants
an
amicable
divorce
but
it's
unclear
why
he
thinks
any
dissolution
would
be
peaceful
just
this
week
ran
an
interview
with
chris
a
year-old
white
man
from
rural
pennsylvania
who
backed
up
the
idea
of
dissolution
as
chris
revealed
he
thinks
american
dissolution
is
effectively
a
fait
accompli
i
feel
like
it's
going
to
happen
one
way
or
the
other
he
said
maybe
if
we
can
control
the
process
a
little
it
won't
be
quite
as
bad
his
support
for
dissolution
rests
largely
on
the
racists
surrounding
him
pointing
out
that
those
in
his
community
regularly
refer
to
martin
luther
king
day
with
racial
slurs
it's
the
n-word
chris
said
noting
how
people
describe
the
holiday
n-day
is
kinda
what
they
say
even
the
people
who
don't
say
it
chuckle
at
it
perhaps
unsurprisingly
much
of
the
recent
rhetoric
advocating
for
u.s.
dissolution
whether
from
white
supremacists
or
otherwise
is
predicated
on
the
belief
that
american
socio-political
divides
remain
at
the
state
level
that
the
supposed
red
state
blue
state
divide
remains
insoluble
but
the
notion
that
america's
divide
remains
on
a
state-by-state
basis
is
years
out
of
date
instead
as
recent
elections
indicate
the
split
is
far
more
centered
on
rural-urban
divides
just
look
at
texas
two
decades
ago
austin
was
viewed
as
a
blue
island
in
a
sea
of
red
in
the
second
half
of
this
decade
texas's
major
urban
areas
houston
and
dallas
san
antonio
and
fort
worth
have
all
tilted
democratic
texas
is
no
different
from
other
republican-leaning
states
where
major
cities
louisville
ky
indianapolis
ind
missoula
montana
have
voted
democratic
in
recent
years
and
there's
little
reason
to
think
that
trajectory
will
shift
in
the
foreseeable
future
but
then
that
allegedly
was
one
of
the
factors
driving
the
shooter
responsible
for
the
killings
in
el
paso
it's
also
one
of
the
reasons
domestic
terrorists
like
him
have
begun
turning
toward
trying
to
dissolve
the
nation
rather
than
returning
to
what
they
view
as
the
halcyon
days
of
white
supremacy
i
think
the
closer
we
get
to
the
election
the
more
scary
it's
going
to
get
christian
picciolini
a
former
white
supremacist
who
renounced
the
movement
to
run
anti-extremist
programs
told
thinkprogress
if
the
democrats
win
and
i'm
not
predicting
anything
this
is
just
my
opinion
if
the
democrats
win
i
think
you
will
see
a
lot
of
activity
in
states
that
are
heavily
republican
starting
to
talk
about
secession
starting
to
say
do
we
want
to
be
part
of
this
liberal
socialist
whatever-they're-calling-it
america
and
i
think
you'll
have
discussions
about
that
picciolini
said
but
on
other
hand
you're
going
to
have
people
who
are
unstable
who
are
going
to
say
i'm
tired
of
waiting
now
i
want
to
make
it
happen
i
want
to
kick
off
this
race
war
