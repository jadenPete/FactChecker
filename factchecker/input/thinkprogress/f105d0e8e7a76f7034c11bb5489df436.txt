trump
is
lobbying
hard
to
bring
russia
back
to
the
g
and
he's
trying
to
blame
obama
for
russia's
annexation
of
crimea
president
donald
trump
on
monday
doubled
down
on
his
effort
to
bring
russia
back
into
the
g
speaking
from
the
annual
g
summit
in
biarritz
france
trump
said
he
supported
russia's
return
to
what
was
previously
the
g
even
though
many
other
members
of
the
group
were
critical
of
the
idea
russia
itself
has
also
said
it
does
not
want
to
return
trump
had
apparently
been
lobbying
to
bring
russia
back
throughout
the
weekend
leading
to
what
the
guardian
reported
were
heated
exchanges
with
other
world
leaders
only
outgoing
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
supported
his
idea
russia
was
suspended
from
the
group
five
years
ago
for
annexing
crimea
from
the
ukraine
a
situation
that
has
not
yet
been
resolved
most
of
the
other
leaders
condition
russia's
return
on
its
agreement
to
implement
the
minsk-
agreements
and
restore
control
of
the
donbass
region
to
ukraine
during
a
press
conference
monday
however
trump
continued
to
claim
that
the
annexation
and
russia's
subsequent
removal
from
the
g
was
all
somehow
president
barack
obama's
fault
president
obama
was
not
happy
this
happened
because
it
was
embarrassing
to
him
trump
claimed
right
the
annexation
of
crimea
was
very
embarrassing
to
him
and
he
wanted
russia
to
be
out
of
what
was
called
the
g
that
was
his
determination
he
was
outsmarted
by
putin
president
putin
outsmarted
president
obama
even
after
a
reporter
confronted
trump
on
that
lie
stating
that
russia's
expulsion
had
been
the
result
of
its
own
actions
and
was
agreed
upon
by
the
remaining
g
the
president
doubled
down
president
obama
was
helping
ukraine
crimea
was
annexed
during
his
term
trump
insisted
it
could've
been
stopped
with
the
right
whatever
later
another
reporter
pressed
trump
on
the
fact
that
russia
had
indicated
just
a
few
hours
earlier
that
it
didn't
want
to
return
to
the
economic
group
his
reaction
was
to
simply
assert
that
the
country
would
come
back
if
invited
i
know
one
thing
if
they
were
invited
back
they
would
be
there
and
if
not
that's
okay
too
trump
said
the
president
described
russia
as
an
asset
and
suggested
that
it
would
be
easier
if
they
were
in
the
room
during
multilateral
discussions
trump's
pleas
on
russia
behalf
which
first
began
at
last
year's
summit
serve
to
assist
both
himself
and
and
russia
as
the
moscow
times
vladimir
frolov
noted
the
charade
actually
distracts
from
trump's
performance
at
the
summit
which
according
to
most
reports
was
erratic
but
the
gesture
also
helps
russia
the
more
trump
haggles
over
what
it
would
take
to
bring
russia
back
the
lower
the
expectations
will
be
regarding
russia's
handling
of
the
situation
in
the
ukraine
and
putin
will
not
be
giving
up
crimea
under
any
circumstances
for
russia
what
really
counts
is
the
talk
about
reinstating
russia
to
the
g
not
the
actual
re-entry
to
the
club
frolov
wrote
this
discussion
benefits
moscow
as
it
eliminates
the
stigma
of
denial
and
isolation
from
the
west
caused
by
russia's
actions
in
ukraine
in
it
also
increases
western
pressure
on
ukraine
to
accept
russia's
conditions
and
creates
leverage
for
moscow
on
a
host
of
other
issues
