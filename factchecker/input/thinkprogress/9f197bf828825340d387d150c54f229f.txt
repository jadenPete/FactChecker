trump
brags
about
indefinite
child
detention
because
he's
bringing
families
together
trump
boasts
about
his
latest
cruel
immigration
policies
just
hours
after
his
administration
put
forth
a
new
rule
to
keep
immigrant
children
detained
indefinitely
president
donald
trump
insisted
that
he
was
the
one
bringing
immigrant
families
together
he
left
out
the
part
about
them
being
together
in
cages
if
you
remember
president
obama
had
separation
trump
insisted
to
reporters
on
the
south
lawn
wednesday
i'm
the
one
who
brought
them
together
this
new
rule
would
do
even
more
to
bring
them
together
but
it
was
president
obama
that
had
the
separation
later
a
reporter
tried
to
question
trump
directly
about
the
unlimited
detention
of
migrant
minors
his
administration
now
supports
trump
doubled
down
i
am
the
one
that
kept
the
families
together
you
remember
that
right
just
remember
i
said
it
he
insisted
his
new
policy
he
explained
will
make
it
almost
impossible
for
people
to
come
into
our
country
illegally
trump's
claims
of
family
unity
belie
the
cruelty
of
these
proposed
new
policies
previously
a
court
settlement
known
as
flores
required
that
an
immigrant
child
can
only
be
detained
on
their
own
for
days
while
it's
technically
true
that
children
were
detained
during
the
obama
administration
because
of
this
policy
he
would
release
the
entire
families
after
those
days
so
they
could
stay
together
an
overwhelming
majority
of
those
families
or
six
out
of
seven
returned
for
their
court
hearings
as
required
by
law
it
was
the
trump
administration
that
started
the
cruel
zero
tolerance
policy
of
family
separation
releasing
the
children
as
required
but
keeping
the
parents
detained
in
too
many
cases
these
children
became
lost
in
the
bureaucracy
trump's
new
policy
would
detain
the
children
with
their
parents
which
would
hypothetically
circumvent
the
flores
decision
and
allow
those
children
to
stay
locked
up
indefinitely
the
trump
administration
previously
argued
in
court
that
while
they
are
detained
children
do
not
deserve
soap
or
toothbrushes
and
now
it
expects
to
be
trusted
to
house
these
children
even
longer
yes
trump
will
be
bringing
families
together
but
only
to
be
left
to
rot
in
dismal
facilities
the
important
context
in
trump's
comments
is
his
admission
that
the
point
of
this
latest
cruelty
is
to
act
as
a
deterrent
to
immigration
this
new
rule
is
only
the
latest
example
of
this
attempted
deterrence
including
implementing
asylum
officers
and
allowing
abhorrent
conditions
in
detention
facilities
while
there's
no
evidence
such
an
approach
is
having
any
measurable
effect
the
administration
seems
to
believe
it
just
hasn't
been
cruel
enough
yet
