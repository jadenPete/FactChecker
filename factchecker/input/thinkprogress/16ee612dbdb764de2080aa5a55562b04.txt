nba
star
takes
big
swing
at
increasing
diversity
in
golf
with
historic
howard
donation
this
is
going
to
go
way
beyond
the
game
of
golf
way
beyond
howard
when
pete
bevacqua
was
on
his
way
out
the
door
as
the
ceo
of
pga
of
america
last
year
he
was
clear
about
the
most
pressing
problem
facing
the
sport
it
is
still
overwhelmingly
a
sport
for
rich
white
men
the
biggest
challenge
is
i
think
the
challenge
that
everyone
in
golf
shares
which
is
how
do
you
grow
this
game
bevacqua
said
how
do
you
make
this
game
more
accessible
and
more
diverse
on
monday
a
piece
of
the
answer
came
from
two-time
nba
mvp
steph
curry
who
announced
a
six-year
seven-figure
commitment
to
howard
university
to
establish
the
school's
first
division
i
golf
program
the
university
calls
it
a
historic
stride
forward
to
grow
the
game
of
golf
curry
has
big
plans
for
the
program
too
this
is
going
to
go
way
beyond
the
game
of
golf
way
beyond
howard
curry
said
this
is
huge
this
all
started
in
january
when
curry
visited
howard
for
a
screening
of
emanuel
a
documentary
he
executive
produced
about
the
emanuel
ame
church
shooting
in
charleston
as
wesley
lowery
reported
for
the
washington
post
howard
junior
otis
ferguson
approached
curry
after
the
screening
and
engaged
him
in
a
brief
conversation
about
their
mutual
love
of
golf
he
told
curry
that
howard
didn't
have
a
golf
program
and
casually
mentioned
that
he'd
been
trying
to
set
up
a
club
team
curry
was
intrigued
and
they
exchanged
contact
information
over
the
next
couple
of
months
ferguson
kept
curry
updated
through
e-mail
on
the
status
of
his
club
team
after
the
nba
season
ended
the
golden
state
warriors
star
reached
out
to
howard
and
began
talks
about
starting
a
program
howard
used
to
have
a
division
ii
golf
program
but
it
was
discontinued
sometime
in
the
s
like
many
other
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
howard
athletics
has
not
prioritized
funding
a
golf
team
in
the
intervening
decades
primarily
because
of
the
focus
on
revenue-generating
sports
such
as
football
and
basketball
but
curry
thinks
it's
crucial
for
everyone
to
have
access
to
a
sport
that
means
so
much
to
him
it
might
not
have
been
the
sport
that
made
him
a
multi-millionaire
but
it
is
the
sport
that
he
says
gave
him
access
to
networking
circles
and
helped
him
find
mental
clarity
golf
is
a
sport
that
has
changed
my
life
in
ways
that
are
less
tangible
but
just
as
impactful
curry
said
it's
a
discipline
that
challenges
your
mental
wherewithal
from
patience
to
focus
and
is
impossible
to
truly
master
so
when
you
hear
about
these
passionate
student
athletes
who
have
the
talent
but
don't
have
a
fair
shot
at
the
game
it's
tough
i
feel
really
honored
to
play
a
small
role
in
the
rich
history
of
howard
university
and
look
forward
to
building
their
first
men's
and
women's
golf
teams
with
them
the
school
aims
to
debut
its
first
men's
and
women's
golf
teams
in
the
academic
year
it
will
start
with
a
coach
and
three
scholarship
athletes
two
for
women
and
one
for
men
curry
is
spreading
out
his
donation
over
six
years
hoping
to
give
howard
time
to
raise
an
endowed
fund
to
keep
the
program
going
sustainability
is
the
key
when
tiger
woods
burst
onto
the
scene
many
hoped
that
more
black
golfers
would
follow
his
lead
but
over
the
last
two
decades
the
sport
has
remained
predominantly
white
in
the
united
states
according
to
statistics
the
pga
of
america
provided
reuters
last
year
only
of
recreational
golfers
are
non-caucasian
statistics
are
even
more
damning
on
the
college
and
professional
ranks
according
to
the
ncaa
only
of
all
ncaa
golfers
last
year
were
black
latinx
or
native
american
and
currently
out
of
active
players
there
are
only
three
players
of
african-american
descent
on
the
pga
tour
and
four
on
the
lpga
tour
according
to
the
new
york
times
one
of
the
four
african-american
players
on
the
lpga
tour
is
cheyenne
woods
tigers
niece
while
the
lpga
often
touts
its
diversity
it
is
usually
referring
to
global
diversity
not
an
increase
in
african-american
participation
the
establishment
of
a
men's
and
women's
golf
program
at
howard
won't
change
all
of
this
overnight
of
course
but
it
is
an
important
and
high-profile
step
towards
making
the
game
more
accessible
to
black
communities
the
hope
is
breaking
down
that
barrier
of
entry
will
open
up
new
opportunities
for
black
golfers
on
and
off
the
course
golf
has
always
been
a
game
of
privilege
said
kery
davis
howard's
athletic
director
an
association
with
the
sport
can
break
down
barriers
