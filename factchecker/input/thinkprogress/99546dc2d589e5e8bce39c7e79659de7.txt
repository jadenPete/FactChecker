youtube
shuts
down
coordinated
campaign
to
discredit
hong
kong
protesters
it
follows
similar
moves
made
by
facebook
and
twitter
earlier
this
week
youtube's
parent
company
google
has
announced
that
it
was
disabling
channels
that
were
part
of
a
coordinated
campaign
to
mold
public
opinion
about
the
pro-democracy
protests
that
have
gripped
hong
kong
for
months
in
a
blog
post
on
thursday
google
said
it
had
discovered
the
channels
in
this
network
behaved
in
a
coordinated
manner
while
uploading
videos
related
to
the
ongoing
protests
in
hong
kong
this
discovery
was
consistent
with
recent
observations
and
actions
related
to
china
announced
by
facebook
and
twitter
google
added
we
found
the
use
of
vpns
and
other
methods
to
disguise
the
origin
of
these
accounts
and
other
activity
commonly
associated
with
coordinated
influence
operations
google
did
not
elaborate
on
the
specifics
of
what
the
videos
contained
but
similarities
in
the
recent
twitter
and
facebook
takedowns
makes
it
likely
the
videos
were
spreading
disinformation
suggesting
the
hong
kong
protests
were
violent
and
did
not
represent
the
majority
of
residents
twitter
said
earlier
in
this
week
that
it
deleted
accounts
and
shut
down
a
spam
network
of
more
than
accounts
which
it
described
as
a
significant
state-backed
information
operation
focused
on
the
situation
in
hong
kong
the
accounts
were
deliberately
and
specifically
attempting
to
sow
political
discord
it
said
facebook
for
its
part
removed
seven
pages
three
groups
and
five
accounts
both
twitter
and
facebook
said
the
accounts
were
linked
to
individuals
associated
with
the
chinese
government
which
has
been
struggling
to
control
the
narrative
surrounding
the
hong
kong
protests
the
facebook
and
twitter
accounts
sought
to
portray
the
protests
as
violent
one
compared
the
protesters
to
isis
while
another
described
the
protesters
as
cockroaches
in
reality
the
hong
kong
protests
save
a
few
scuffles
have
been
nonviolent
last
sunday
for
instance
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
marched
through
the
city's
victoria
park
in
a
completely
peaceful
demonstration
marking
the
th
week
of
protests
organizers
claimed
as
many
as
million
people
took
part
but
there
is
no
way
to
independently
verify
that
twitter
facebook
and
youtube
are
all
blocked
in
china
making
it
easier
for
the
regime
to
portray
the
hong
kong
protests
as
the
actions
of
a
violent
minority
the
discovery
of
chinese
disinformation
on
major
tech
platforms
however
shows
that
strategy
is
not
having
the
same
success
on
the
outside
world
twitter
made
such
a
strategy
even
more
difficult
by
forbidding
chinese-run
state
media
outlets
from
promoting
their
tweets
so
they
would
appear
prominently
on
timelines
meanwhile
the
world
has
looked
on
with
trepidation
as
chinese
military
forces
begin
to
amass
in
shenzhen
just
across
the
border
from
hong
kong
an
adviser
to
hong
kong's
leader
carrie
lam
has
warned
that
the
people's
liberation
army
could
move
into
the
city
if
the
situation
further
deteriorates
