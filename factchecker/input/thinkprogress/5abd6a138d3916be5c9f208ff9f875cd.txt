trump
suggests
little
to
end
gun
violence
in
wake
of
deadly
shootings
he
blamed
social
media
video
games
and
mental
health
for
the
attacks
claims
that
have
been
repeatedly
debunked
president
donald
trump
gave
formal
remarks
monday
morning
in
response
to
two
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
but
he
did
not
offer
one
realistic
solution
for
preventing
such
gun
violence
in
the
future
instead
the
president
rehashed
most
of
the
major
debunked
arguments
often
used
by
gun
advocacy
groups
to
distract
from
actual
gun-violence
prevention
measures
he
also
called
out
racist
extremism
without
taking
any
responsibility
for
his
own
contributions
on
that
front
after
extending
his
condolences
to
the
victims
and
their
families
trump
pointed
to
the
alleged
el
paso
shooter's
manifesto
which
was
reportedly
posted
on
chan
prior
to
the
attack
describing
the
suspect
as
having
been
consumed
by
racist
hate
the
country
he
said
must
condemn
racism
bigotry
and
white
supremacy
calling
them
sinister
ideologies
he
blamed
the
internet
for
being
a
dangerous
avenue
to
radicalize
disturbed
minds
and
perform
demented
acts
he
said
that
shining
light
on
the
dark
recesses
of
the
internet
would
stop
the
mass
murders
before
they
start
trump
made
no
reference
to
his
own
social
media
accounts
which
document
his
recent
attacks
on
nonwhite
members
of
congress
his
constant
references
to
immigration
as
invasions
and
the
many
times
he
himself
has
elevated
white
supremacists
on
twitter
trump
proceeded
to
outline
four
ways
future
gun
violence
could
be
prevented
none
of
which
had
anything
to
do
with
limiting
access
to
guns
first
he
called
on
social
media
companies
to
look
for
red
flags
he
then
called
for
the
end
of
the
glorification
of
violence
in
our
society
including
gruesome
and
grisly
video
games
he
also
blamed
mental
illness
falsely
suggesting
that
mental
illness
and
hatred
pulls
the
trigger
not
the
gun
lastly
he
called
for
the
death
penalty
to
be
used
against
mass
murderers
studies
have
shown
that
red
flag
laws
like
trump
proposed
have
helped
reduce
suicides
in
the
states
where
they've
been
enforced
groups
like
everytown
for
gun
safety
have
also
noted
that
such
laws
dubbed
extreme
risk
laws
also
work
to
prevent
mass
attacks
like
those
in
el
paso
and
dayton
the
emerging
body
of
research
shows
that
extreme
risk
laws
work
to
prevent
firearm
suicide
and
they
can
also
help
prevent
would-be
mass
shooters
from
committing
violence
everytown
noted
in
march
an
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
support
extreme
risk
laws
in
a
recent
survey
percent
of
likely
voters
favored
congress
passing
an
extreme
risk
law
extreme
risk
laws
also
enjoy
bipartisan
support
a
senate
judiciary
committee
hearing
on
such
laws
this
spring
triggered
no
immediate
legislative
action
however
on
monday
according
to
the
hill
senate
judiciary
committee
chairman
lindsey
graham
r-sc
said
he
and
sen
richard
blumenthal
d-ct
had
reached
a
deal
to
introduce
a
bill
meant
to
encourage
and
assist
states
financially
with
implementation
of
red
flag
laws
graham
said
the
bill
had
the
president's
full
support
these
grants
will
be
given
to
law
enforcement
so
they
can
hire
and
consult
with
mental
health
professionals
to
better
determine
which
cases
need
to
be
acted
upon
this
grant
program
also
requires
robust
due
process
and
judicial
review
it
does
allow
for
quick
action
he
said
in
a
statement
the
claim
that
video
games
have
any
impact
on
gun
violence
has
been
repeatedly
debunked
studies
have
found
no
correlation
between
the
rate
of
video
game
sales
and
mass
violence
indeed
the
same
video
games
that
are
popular
in
the
united
states
are
often
popular
in
many
other
countries
that
do
not
experience
the
same
sort
of
mass
gun
violence
that
occurs
here
those
countries
typically
have
far
fewer
guns
than
the
united
states
mental
illness
is
likewise
a
poor
indicator
of
gun
violence
as
a
recent
study
found
access
to
firearms
was
the
primary
culprit
when
it
came
to
incidents
of
gun
violence
not
mental-health
issues
trump's
reference
to
the
death
penalty
on
monday
was
also
misleading
over
countries
have
abandoned
capital
punishment
recognizing
that
it
does
nothing
to
deter
crime
in
fact
the
practice
is
prohibited
by
the
european
union
the
trump
administration
on
the
other
hand
recently
announced
that
the
federal
government
would
resume
the
use
of
capital
punishment
for
the
first
time
in
decades
noticeably
absent
from
trump's
speech
was
any
reference
to
common-sense
gun
reform
such
as
a
ban
on
assault
weapons
a
ban
on
high-capacity
magazines
or
a
ban
on
gun
ownership
for
people
who
have
committed
hate
crime
misdemeanors
rep
jerry
nadler
d-ny
chair
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
pointed
out
sunday
that
the
house
has
already
passed
several
gun-violence
prevention
bills
including
legislation
requiring
universal
background
checks
and
legislation
closing
the
charleston
loophole
which
allows
dealers
to
transfer
some
firearms
before
background
checks
have
been
completed
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
so
far
refused
to
take
them
up
in
the
senate
this
article
has
been
updated
to
include
comments
from
lindsey
graham
about
his
intent
to
introduce
red
flag
legislation
