president
donald
trump
is
taking
aim
at
one
of
the
largest
expanses
of
temperate
rainforest
in
alaska
on
tuesday
the
president
instructed
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
to
allow
logging
in
the
million
acre
tongass
national
forest
in
southeast
alaska
the
nation's
largest
national
forest
together
with
british
columbia's
great
bear
rainforest
in
canada
the
tongass
encompasses
the
largest
intact
temperate
rainforest
on
earth
the
move
would
undo
logging
restrictions
that
have
been
in
place
for
nearly
years
according
to
the
washington
post
impacting
more
than
half
of
the
national
forest
under
the
clinton-era
roadless
rule
construction
of
roads
were
barred
in
the
forest
thereby
restricting
commercial
logging
energy
and
mining
projects
only
certain
road
projects
approved
by
the
forest
service
were
allowed
the
rule
has
faced
challenges
over
the
years
though
including
by
president
george
w.
bush
who
tried
unsuccessfully
to
reverse
it
alaska
gov
mike
dunleavy
r
and
sen
lisa
murkowski
r
have
also
called
for
trump
to
exempt
the
state
from
the
rule
it
should
never
have
been
applied
to
our
state
and
it
is
harming
our
ability
to
develop
a
sustainable
year-round
economy
for
the
southeast
region
murkowski
said
in
a
statement
to
the
washington
post
environmentalists
however
fear
the
implications
of
opening
up
the
rainforest
to
commercial
activities
the
pristine
forest
includes
thousands
of
islands
along
with
glacial
fjords
and
old-growth
cedar
spruce
and
hemlock
trees
old-growth
trees
are
those
that
have
generally
grown
undisturbed
for
at
least
years
the
area
supports
countless
wildlife
including
all
five
species
of
pacific
salmon
brown
bears
wolves
and
bald
eagles
over
the
years
logging
has
threatened
the
oldest
and
largest
trees
but
while
only
of
the
rare
forest
has
so
far
been
threatened
by
logging
according
to
the
audubon
society
perhaps
half
of
the
big-tree
old
growth
has
been
cut
the
forest
is
also
a
vital
player
in
tackling
climate
change
the
tongass
stores
hundreds
of
millions
if
not
over
a
billion
tons
of
carbon
keeping
the
heat-trapping
element
out
of
the
atmosphere
wrote
earthjustice
which
tweeted
that
the
old-growth
trees
provide
a
major
buffer
against
climate
change
cutting
down
ancient
trees
risks
not
just
releasing
the
carbon
stored
in
them
over
the
past
century
but
also
reducing
the
forest's
ability
to
store
new
carbon
news
of
the
trump
administration's
logging
intentions
in
tongass
come
as
another
major
forest
suffers
devastating
wildfires
in
brazil
more
than
forest
fires
have
been
recorded
in
the
amazon
this
month
the
most
in
a
decade
like
the
tongass
the
amazon
often
referred
to
as
the
lungs
of
the
planet
plays
a
vital
role
in
storing
carbon
as
well
as
critical
habitat
to
endangered
