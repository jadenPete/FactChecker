u.s.
park
police
in
washington
d.c.
have
made
at
least
arrests
of
men
in
the
past
year
who
went
to
a
local
park
to
meet
other
men
over
the
past
year
a
public
information
officer
told
the
washington
blade

meridian

a
known

a

police
public
information
officer
told
the
publication
that
the
arrests
involved
charges
of
lewd
acts
unlawful
entry
simple
assault
sexual
and
disorderly
conduct
delgado
said
complaints
from
the
public
were
the
reason
for
the
arrests
activists
and
lawyers
question
however
whether
the
arrests
simply
have
the
effect
of
criminalizing
queer
men
of
color
who
go
to
parks
to
meet
other
men
defense
attorney
john
albanes
told
the
blade
that
some
of
his
fellow
attorneys
who
represent
some
of
the
men
who
allegedly
were
detained
as
part
of
an
undercover
sting
operation
in
which
officers
pretended
to
show
interest
in
consensual
sex
albanes
said
some
of
the
men
were
arrested
for
misdemeanor
sexual
abuse
which
is
defined
as
engaging
in
a
sexual
act
or
sexual
contact
with
another
person
and
should
have
knowledge
or
reason
to
know
it
was
committed
without
that
other
person's
permission
anyone
found
guilty
of
this
act
is
could
be
imprisoned
for
up
to
days
and
may
also
be
fined
preston
mitchum
senior
legal
and
international
policy
analyst
for
advocates
for
youth
said
people
should
ask
why
law
enforcement
is
using
public
funds
to
put
queer
men
at
risk
in
the
criminal
justice
system
these
queer
men
are
overall
entering
situations
they
believe
are
consensual
and
that
by
and
large
are
consensual
but
for
there
being
a
plain-clothes
officer
who
is
actually
setting
up
a
situation
for
queer
men
to
succumb
to
he
said
so
it
isn't
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
this
is
intended
to
police
their
behavior
i
can
see
these
situations
occurring
more
and
more
especially
in
bigger
cities
queried
by
thinkprogress
delgado
was
unable
to
provide
an
approximate
of
number
complaints
that
prompted
the
police
action
he
did
not
confirm
or
deny
that
the
operation
deployed
plain-clothes
officers
and
said
he
could
not
respond
to
allegations
from
a
defense
attorney
that
the
men
were
being
criminalized
for
what
they
believed
was
a
consensual
prospective
sexual
encounter
i
do
not
have
the
information
you
are
requesting
the
police
spokesman
said
suggesting
that
thinkprogress
make
a
foia
request
however
delgado
told
the
blade
earlier
this
week
the
u.s.
park
police
receives
complaints
about
lewd
acts
that
occur
within
meridian
hill
as
with
any
other
complaint
of
illegal
activity
we
then
take
actions
to
stop
it
plain
clothes
officers
are
just
one
method
of
enforcement
sometimes
used
to
deter
stop
and
or
arrest
violators
within
the
parks
although
gay
cruising
stings
are
often
portrayed
as
a
relic
of
the
past
there
have
been
a
number
of
such
operations
in
recent
years
during
one
sex
sting
police
in
dallas
texas
police
said
they
arrested
seven
men
at
a
park
although
a
local
activist
said
the
number
of
detained
was
in
total
mostly
for
indecent
exposure
in
male
sex
workers
and
eight
clients
were
arrested
in
an
area
where
queer
men
are
known
to
meet
david
booth
policy
and
advocacy
director
for
black
and
pink
an
lgbtq
rights
organization
that
seeks
to
abolish
the
criminal
punishment
system
said
that
race
gender
and
sexual
identity
always
have
to
be
considered
when
considering
why
police
set
up
these
stings
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
a
known
area
for
cruising
so
this
tells
me
exactly
the
reasons
why
they're
doing
that
so
they
can
catch
queer
and
trans
people
and
queer
of
trans
people
of
color
he
said
booth
said
the
consequences
for
men
caught
in
sex
stings
such
as
this
one
can
be
severe
even
though
in
many
of
these
cases
they
are
planning
to
have
consensual
sex
because
many
of
these
are
sex
offenses
these
are
the
worst
of
the
worst
and
if
they
get
on
that
registry
the
chances
of
them
ever
finding
professional
jobs
are
slim
to
none
if
they
publish
mug
shots
and
a
list
of
names
of
people
that
reputation
damage
is
just
enough
booth
said
in
police
at
manhattan
beach
california
came
under
fire
from
lgbtq
organizations
for
releasing
the
names
and
photos
of
men
arrested
in
an
uncover
sex
sting
in
a
public
restroom
the
police
chief
eve
irvine
said
it
was
standard
operating
procedure
to
release
the
photos
and
that
it
was
never
our
intention
to
humiliate
anyone
whether
they
are
heterosexual
or
homosexual
this
is
just
one
example
of
what
lgbtq
advocates
say
is
a
discriminatory
enforcement
of
laws
hiv
criminalization
laws
that
rely
on
inaccurate
information
about
hiv
and
penalize
behavior
from
folks
living
with
hiv
regardless
of
whether
the
behavior
carries
risk
of
transmission
these
laws
are
mostly
enforced
against
queer
men
of
color
and
transgender
women
of
color
according
to
a
report
on
lgbtq
people
of
color
and
the
criminal
justice
system
from
the
movement
advancement
project
and
center
for
american
progress
the
report
also
mentions
the
frequent
profiling
of
trans
women
of
color
as
sex
workers
by
police
mitchum
stressed
that
lgbtq
people
of
color
are
being
targeted
through
these
kinds
of
practices
far
too
often
within
lgbtq
communities
of
color
we
know
what
criminalization
looks
like
we
know
what
it
looked
like
years
ago
at
stonewall
he
said
it
doesn't
stop
at
someone
wanting
to
engage
in
sex
in
a
park
or
meeting
in
a
park
to
engage
in
sex
at
their
own
home
this
is
about
law
enforcement
using
whatever
mechanisms
they
need
to
use
and
doubling
and
tripling
them
up
to
impact
lgbtq
people
of
color
he
said
when
you
have
homophobia
or
trans-antagonism
and
you
have
racism
and
poverty
that
makes
the
perfect
storm
to
make
sure
people
are
incarcerated
and
experience
the
collateral
consequences
for
a
lifetime
to
come
