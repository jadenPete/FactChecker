trump
appears
ready
to
cave
to
the
nra
on
gun
reform
following
mass
shootings
congress
is
also
locked
in
a
stalemate
and
likely
won't
discuss
any
meaningful
changes
until
after
the
august
recess
president
donald
trump
is
already
lowering
expectations
for
how
much
congress
will
actually
accomplish
in
terms
of
gun
reform
following
a
series
of
mass
shootings
across
the
country
in
a
pair
of
tweets
friday
morning
trump
indicated
some
discussion
on
background
checks
may
occur
in
the
coming
days
but
also
shored
up
his
loyalty
to
the
national
rifle
association
nra
and
his
support
for
the
second
amendment
serious
discussions
are
taking
place
between
house
and
senate
leadership
on
meaningful
background
checks
i
have
also
been
speaking
to
the
nra
and
others
so
that
their
very
strong
views
can
be
fully
represented
and
respected
he
wrote
guns
should
not
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
mentally
ill
or
deranged
people
he
continued
i
am
the
biggest
second
amendment
person
there
is
but
we
all
must
work
together
for
the
good
and
safety
of
our
country
common
sense
things
can
be
done
that
are
good
for
everyone
the
tweets
suggest
the
president
is
prepared
to
bow
to
nra
pressure
once
more
trump
notably
did
not
mention
the
red
flag
laws
he
supported
in
recent
days
the
one
solution
that
enjoys
bipartisan
support
on
the
hill
these
laws
allow
family
members
and
police
to
inform
judges
of
concerning
behavior
in
order
to
remove
firearms
from
an
individual
who
is
perceived
as
a
threat
to
themselves
or
others
and
despite
apparent
willingness
in
the
senate
trump
also
made
no
reference
to
banning
assault-style
weapons
having
seemingly
given
up
on
the
idea
earlier
this
week
despite
broad
national
support
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
said
that
both
red
flag
laws
and
expanding
background
checks
would
be
front
and
center
of
any
ensuing
reform
debate
but
mcconnell
himself
has
voted
against
background
checks
in
the
past
the
nra
strongly
opposes
background
checks
and
reached
out
to
trump
to
make
its
objections
known
this
week
according
to
the
washington
post
nra
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
spoke
with
trump
on
tuesday
after
the
president
expressed
support
for
a
background
check
bill
and
told
him
it
would
not
be
popular
among
trump's
supporters
according
to
officials
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
freely
discuss
internal
talks
lapierre
also
reportedly
argued
against
the
bill's
merits
according
to
the
officials
the
president
dismissed
concerns
that
he
would
cave
to
the
nra
on
friday
telling
reporters
that
while
he
had
a
lot
of
respect
for
the
people
at
the
nra
and
had
already
spoken
to
them
on
numerous
occasions
the
country
needed
intelligent
background
checks
that
included
incidents
or
details
from
people's
juvenile
records
it
isn't
a
question
of
nra
republican
or
democrat
i
will
tell
you
i
spoke
to
mitch
mcconnell
yesterday
he
is
totally
on
board
trump
said
but
he
added
we'll
see
where
the
nra
will
be
we
have
to
have
meaningful
background
checks
in
the
case
of
the
two
shooters
over
the
weekend
in
el
paso
and
dayton
ohio
it
is
possible
they
wouldn't
have
been
caught
mcconnell
for
his
part
does
not
seem
concerned
about
acting
with
urgency
saying
he
would
support
a
debate
on
the
topic
once
congress
reconvenes
from
the
august
recess
in
early
september
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-ca
had
previously
recommended
the
senate
return
early
to
take
up
bipartisan
legislation
passed
by
the
house
earlier
this
year
trump
has
long
opposed
any
form
of
gun
control
claiming
that
it
does
not
reduce
crime
he's
also
specifically
voiced
his
opposition
to
expanding
background
checks
because
he
doesn't
believe
the
current
background
checks
work
his
latest
deferral
to
the
nra
is
not
new
either
just
four
months
ago
trump
spoke
at
the
nra
convention
and
assured
them
he
didn't
support
any
measure
that
took
guns
away
from
people
including
bills
house
democrats
had
passed
he
told
the
group
he
would
never
let
them
down
because
as
the
famous
saying
goes
when
guns
are
outlawed
only
outlaws
will
have
guns
very
simple
