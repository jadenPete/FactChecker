trump's
top
negotiator
at
taliban
peace
talks
is
coming
home
empty-handed
i
am
on
my
way
back
to
dc
to
consult
on
next
steps

kabul
afghanistan
talks
between
the
united
states
and
the
taliban
came
to
an
end
on
monday
without
a
much-anticipated
agreement
to
end
america's
longest-ever
foreign
war
the
latest
round
of
negotiations
went
into
two
days
of
the
eid-al
adha
holiday
without
a
breakthrough
but
as
recently
as
sunday
the
top
u.s.
negotiator
zalmay
khalilzad
had
expressed
the
hope
that
peace
was
imminent
i
hope
this
is
the
last
eid
where
afghanistan
is
at
war
he
wrote
on
twitter
i
know
afghans
yearn
for
peace
the
talks
which
do
not
include
any
official
representatives
of
the
afghan
government
have
largely
hinged
on
two
issues
the
u.s.
seeking
an
assurance
that
the
taliban
will
not
allow
afghanistan
to
be
used
as
a
base
for
foreign
armed
groups
and
washington
announcing
an
official
withdrawal
date
for
the
u.s.
service
members
that
are
still
in
the
country
when
this
latest
round
of
negotiations
began
in
doha
on
august
rumors
of
potential
ceasefires
announcements
of
a
u.s.
troop
withdrawal
and
any
number
of
other
developments
were
expected
to
be
announced
but
later
monday
khalilzad
the
trump
administration's
lead
negotiator
tweeted
that
much
of
the
discussions
centered
around
technical
details
and
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
dc
to
consult
on
next
steps
as
with
every
previous
round
of
talks
the
discussions
took
place
behind
closed
doors
with
no
official
details
of
what
specifically
was
addressed
and
what
remains
to
be
hashed
out
what
exactly
the
next
steps
khalilzad
who
served
as
george
w.
bush's
ambassador
to
iraq
and
afghanistan
referred
to
are
is
still
under
question
however
when
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
visited
kabul
last
month
he
made
it
very
clear
that
he
wanted
the
matter
resolved
quickly
i
hope
we
have
a
peace
deal
before
september
that's
certainly
our
mission
pompeo
said
during
his
seven-hour
trip
to
the
afghan
capital
in
july
last
week
the
ex-olympic
committee
director
during
the
taliban's
five-year
rule
mawlavi
abdul
shokor
mutmaeen
had
seemed
to
be
hinting
at
an
important
development
when
he
said
some
major
breakthroughs
were
made
and
the
talks
are
moving
on
about
some
remaining
issues
and
hopefully
this
will
be
finalized
in
the
near
future
adding
more
uncertainty
to
the
talks
are
planned
presidential
elections
in
afghanistan
scheduled
for
september
during
an
eid
address
on
sunday
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
claimed
that
during
a
meeting
with
pompeo
leading
afghan
politicians
suggested
he
remain
in
power
until
the
peace
negotiations
were
complete
in
the
presence
of
the
secretary
of
state
respected
figures
suggested
that
elections
should
be
delayed
and
that
i
can
remain
in
power
ghani
said
as
he
rebuffed
the
offer
in
that
same
address
while
negotiations
were
still
taking
place
in
doha
ghani
said
the
fate
of
afghanistan
will
be
decided
here
in
this
homeland
our
future
cannot
be
decided
outside
whether
in
the
capital
cities
of
our
friends
nemeses
or
neighbors
doha
and
washington
are
not
the
only
foreign
capitals
to
take
an
active
interest
in
the
afghan
peace
process
while
talks
continued
in
the
qatari
capital
the
government
of
uzbekistan
whose
limits
on
religious
freedom
have
been
of
concern
to
both
the
united
nations
and
human
rights
watch
invited
a
taliban
delegation
including
their
political
deputy
mullah
baradar
akhund
to
visit
tashkent
in
a
statement
issued
in
the
lead-up
to
the
eid
holiday
mullah
haibatullah
akhundzada
the
current
leader
of
the
taliban
movement
said
my
instructions
to
you
are
that
you
give
full
attention
to
protecting
helping
and
comforting
your
believing
nation
during
eid
days
take
all
necessary
steps
for
the
well-being
and
security
of
your
fellow
compatriots
visit
the
families
of
martyrs
disabled
and
prisoners
and
assist
them
to
the
best
of
your
capabilities
the
taliban's
eid
messages
have
largely
ignored
politics
and
opted
instead
to
focus
on
the
protection
of
civilians
at
a
time
when
both
they
along
with
other
armed
groups
and
the
afghan
national
security
forces
and
their
foreign
allies
have
been
accused
of
attacks
and
operations
leading
to
mounting
civilian
casualties
haibutallah's
message
came
one
day
after
a
taliban-claimed
car
bombing
on
a
busy
kabul
road
led
to
the
deaths
of
at
least
people
and
the
wounding
of
more
than
others
