mitch
mcconnell
suggests
trump
cannot
be
trusted
to
mean
what
he
says
on
guns
if
the
president
is
in
favor
of
a
number
of
things
he
has
discussed
openly
and
publicly
and
i
know
we
will
pass
it
and
it'll
become
law
i'll
put
it
on
the
floor
in
the
wake
of
another
series
of
mass
shootings
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
waffled
and
wavered
on
whether
to
take
any
action
to
stop
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
america
nra-backed
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
who
has
long
opposed
any
such
progress
said
tuesday
he
will
wait
and
see
if
trump
actually
means
any
of
the
things
he
said
in
public
before
scheduling
any
senate
votes
after
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
dayton
ohio
and
gilroy
california
left
dozens
of
people
dead
trump
who
benefited
from
more
than
million
in
nra
spending
in
his
race
initially
said
he
wanted
to
ensure
that
all
gun
purchases
required
background
checks
frankly
we
need
intelligent
background
checks
trump
told
reporters
in
early
august
i
spoke
to
mitch
mcconnell
yesterday
he
is
totally
on
board
the
president
claimed
but
after
speaking
with
nra
officials
trump
changed
his
tune
later
in
august
he
reminded
the
nation
that
we
already
have
a
lot
of
background
checks
in
an
interview
with
conservative
radio
host
hugh
hewitt
on
tuesday
days
after
another
mass
shooting
in
odessa
texas
left
at
least
seven
people
dead
mcconnell
made
it
clear
he
doesn't
believe
trump's
public
statements
mean
much
of
anything
mcconnell
said
he
would
wait
and
see
where
the
president
landed
before
committing
to
anything
the
self-described
senate
grim
reaper
typically
blocks
all
legislation
from
even
coming
up
for
a
vote
and
said
that
a
discussion
about
what
to
do
on
the
gun
issue
in
the
wake
of
these
horrendous
shootings
is
ongoing
i
said
several
weeks
ago
that
if
the
president
took
a
position
on
the
bill
so
that
we
knew
we
would
actually
be
making
a
law
and
not
just
having
serial
votes
i'd
be
happy
to
put
it
on
the
floor
mcconnell
said
the
administration
is
in
the
process
of
studying
what
they're
prepared
to
support
if
anything
and
i
expect
to
get
an
answer
to
that
this
week
if
the
president
is
in
favor
of
a
number
of
things
he
has
discussed
openly
and
publicly
and
i
know
we
will
pass
it
and
it'll
become
law
i'll
put
it
on
the
floor
mcconnell
once
objected
to
presidents
who
do
not
actually
support
the
things
they
say
they
support
in
public
in
when
giving
his
party's
response
to
president
bill
clinton's
weekly
radio
address
mcconnell
then
in
his
second
six-year
senate
term
complained
during
the
presidential
campaign
bill
clinton
promised
to
reinvent
government
instead
clinton
has
spent
the
last
three
months
reinventing
his
campaign
promises
