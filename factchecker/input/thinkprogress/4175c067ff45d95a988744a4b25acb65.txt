trump
official
accidentally
implies
that
politicians
like
ted
cruz
have
no
right
to
us
citizenship
trump's
immigration
head
tried
to
justify
the
trump
administration's
new
immigration
policy
but
it
backfired
ken
cuccinelli
presented
a
very
narrow
view
of
who
has
a
legitimate
right
to
be
a
u.s.
citizen
on
tuesday
as
he
attempted
to
justify
the
administration's
new
public
charge
rule
for
immigrants
in
the
process
the
acting
director
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
uscis
inadvertently
suggested
that
even
children
born
abroad
to
u.s.
citizens
like
sen
ted
cruz
r-tx
and
trump's
own
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
robert
wilkie
should
not
be
granted
the
right
to
become
an
american
cuccinelli
the
xenophobic
former
republican
attorney
general
of
virginia
was
interviewed
on
npr's
morning
edition
and
was
asked
to
discuss
the
administration's
new
public
charge
policy
which
discriminates
against
legal
immigrants
deemed
likely
to
need
public
assistance
based
on
their
health
and
monetary
needs
the
acting
uscis
chief
told
the
host
that
immigration
is
a
privilege
for
those
who
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
no
one
has
a
right
to
become
an
american
who
isn't
born
here
as
an
american
he
said
when
pressed
on
the
point
cuccinelli
who
once
compared
immigrants
to
rats
in
a
radio
interview
reiterated
it
is
a
privilege
to
become
an
american
not
a
right
for
anyone
who
is
not
already
an
american
citizen
the
host
noted
that
the
administration's
expanded
means-testing
flew
in
the
face
of
american
tradition
quoting
a
line
from
the
poem
the
new
colossus
which
is
mounted
at
the
base
of
the
statue
of
liberty
and
reads
give
me
your
tired
your
poor
your
huddled
masses
yearning
to
breathe
free
cuccinelli's
remarks
also
overlook
a
large
group
of
people
born
outside
of
the
united
states
with
a
legal
right
to
citizenship
the
children
of
american
citizens
born
abroad
this
would
include
those
born
to
diplomats
people
serving
in
the
military
people
working
in
foreign
countries
and
even
pregnant
travelers
vacationing
outside
the
country
under
cuccinelli's
stated
definition
of
who
has
a
right
to
citizenship
a
host
of
current
elected
and
appointed
officials
are
excluded

the
junior
senator
from
texas
was
born
in
calgary
canada
to
a

was
an
american

as
a
result
cruz
was
eligible
for
both
u.s.

canadian
citizenship
which
he
renounced
in

endorsed

where
his

was
an

category
