million
americans
purged
from
voter
rolls
between
and
new
report
finds
the
most
prolific
purgers
come
from
states
with
a
long
history
of
racial
discrimination
at
least
million
americans
were
purged
from
u.s.
voter
rolls
between
and
with
particularly
dramatic
increases
in
states
with
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
according
to
a
new
report
by
the
brennan
center
for
justice
the
number
of
names
eliminated
by
election
officials
has
surged
since
the
supreme
court
in
significantly
weakened
protections
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
that
decision
shelby
county
v
holder
removed
protections
that
forced
communities
with
a
history
of
discrimination
to
get
department
of
justice
or
federal
court
approval
before
changing
local
voting
laws
a
process
known
as
pre-clearance
the
report
indicates
that
the
communities
with
a
long
history
of
discriminating
against
african
americans
and
latinx
voters
may
still
be
discriminating
against
minorities
by
illegally
purging
names
from
voter
rolls
now
that
pre-clearance
provisions
have
been
lifted
states
such
as
virginia
texas
georgia
and
arizona
between
and
purged
voters
at
much
higher
rates
than
other
states
that
were
never
under
federal
pre-clearance
supervision
there
is
something
about
the
structural
and
systemic
nature
of
these
states
that
has
caused
them
to
look
differently
at
least
with
respect
to
purges
said
myrna
p
rez
director
of
the
brennan
center's
voting
rights
and
elections
program
i
think
this
shows
a
certain
stickiness
to
their
history
of
discrimination
p
rez
added
this
demonstrates
to
me
that
the
supreme
court
was
wrong
in
its
assessment
that
there
is
nothing
special
or
unique
in
these
states
anymore
and
that
they
moved
on
election
officials
often
remove
voters
from
rolls
when
they
become
ineligible
to
vote
in
that
community
such
as
when
a
voter
moves
to
another
state
or
dies
however
voters
who
are
still
eligible
to
vote
are
often
removed
from
rolls
without
their
knowledge
and
only
find
out
that
their
names
were
purged
when
they
are
denied
a
ballot
on
election
day
republicans
say
voter
purging
is
essential
to
preventing
the
nearly
non-existent
issue
of
fraud
the
ballot
box
and
to
that
end
officials
in
several
gop-controlled
states
have
put
into
place
burdensome
voter
regulations
that
often
have
the
effect
of
suppressing
legitimate
votes
by
college
students
african
americans
members
of
the
latinx
community
and
other
democratic-leaning
voters
while
there
are
federal
laws
in
place
to
protect
voters
from
being
improperly
removed
from
the
rolls
there
nevertheless
have
been
examples
in
republican-controlled
states
of
names
being
illegally
removed
a
number
of
states
purged
names
using
the
interstate
voter
registration
crosscheck
program
which
flags
people
who
may
have
voted
in
different
states
but
has
an
extremely
high
margin
of
error
last
year
a
federal
judge
ordered
a
preliminary
injunction
stopping
indiana
from
purging
voters
that
were
flagged
under
the
crosscheck
program
the
brennan
center
is
among
the
organizations
challenging
the
indiana
law
and
the
case
is
still
in
federal
court
earlier
this
year
texas
former
secretary
of
state
david
whitley
resigned
after
a
federal
judge
blocked
him
from
purging
state
voter
rolls
of
the
names
of
nearly
people
who
were
falsely
identified
as
non-citizens
emails
later
suggested
that
texas
gov
greg
abbott
led
the
effort
to
purge
the
names
the
brennan
center's
report
relied
on
data
from
the
u.s.
election
assistance
commission
survey
showing
that
at
least
million
names
were
removed
from
voter
rolls
between
and
immediately
following
the
supreme
court
decision
the
latest
update
to
that
report
which
was
released
last
week
showed
the
number
of
people
that
were
purged
continued
to
grow
with
at
least
million
voters
removed
between
and
p
rez
said
the
brennan
center
does
not
know
how
many
people
were
removed
erroneously
or
with
discriminatory
intent
but
the
results
were
startling
considering
that
about
four
million
more
names
were
removed
from
rolls
between
and
than
between
and
areas
previously
subjected
to
federal
pre-clearance
due
to
past
discriminatory
practices
removed
voters
at
a
median
rate
higher
than
other
jurisdictions
according
to
the
report
about
million
more
people
would
have
remained
on
voter
rolls
if
those
communities
had
purged
voters
at
the
same
rate
as
localities
that
were
never
subject
to
pre-clearance
