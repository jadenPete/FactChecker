steve
king
thinks
society
would
die
out
without
rape
and
incest
he
was
defending
his
hardline
views
on
abortion
rep
steve
king
r-ia
once
again
made
bizarre
comments
in
defense
of
his
extremist
opinions
this
time
rather
than
defending
white
supremacy
he
was
arguing
that
laws
against
abortion
should
not
have
exceptions
for
rape
and
incest
because
rape
and
incest
are
essential
to
the
survival
of
the
species
what
if
we
went
back
through
all
the
family
trees
and
just
pulled
out
anyone
who
was
a
product
of
rape
or
incest
would
there
be
any
population
of
the
world
left
if
we
did
that
he
asked
the
westside
conservative
club
wednesday
considering
all
the
wars
and
all
the
rapes
and
pillages
that
happened
throughout
all
these
different
nations
i
know
that
i
can't
say
that
i
was
not
a
part
of
a
product
of
that
king's
proposed
legislation
outright
banning
abortion
in
all
cases
was
blocked
by
his
fellow
republicans
earlier
this
year
king
came
under
fire
for
telling
the
new
york
times
that
he
didn't
understand
why
white
supremacy
white
nationalism
and
western
supremacy
were
considered
offensive
his
republican
colleagues
finally
noticed
just
how
racist
he
was
and
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-ca
stripped
him
of
his
committee
assignments
mccarthy
stopped
short
however
of
supporting
censure
since
then
king
has
bemoaned
the
way
he
was
treated
while
doubling
down
on
his
hateful
positions
he
cited
the
support
of
a
coalition
of
racist
and
anti-lgbtq
groups
to
suggest
that
his
assignments
should
reinstated
he
posted
a
meme
suggesting
conservatives
would
massacre
liberals
if
there
were
a
civil
war
king
notably
keeps
a
confederate
flag
on
his
desk
despite
the
fact
iowa
was
not
part
of
the
confederacy
even
during
his
speech
wednesday
he
claimed
that
he
was
misquoted
and
that
there
was
an
orchestrated
attempt
to
force
him
to
resign
king
notably
mentioned
that
there
was
a
plan
to
have
president
donald
trump
criticize
him
but
he
met
with
trump
and
got
the
impression
that
there's
no
signal
from
donald
trump
that
he's
anything
other
than
supportive
of
me
trump
has
spent
the
summer
engaging
in
some
rather
egregious
racism
including
against
multiple
members
of
congress
of
color
and
his
xenophobic
rhetoric
was
cited
as
part
of
the
el
paso
shooter's
motive
that
he
was
fine
with
king's
comments
is
a
telling
detail
thinkprogress
reached
out
to
mccarthy's
office
for
comment
including
as
to
whether
the
minority
leader
was
reconsidering
support
for
censure
but
did
not
immediately
hear
back
wednesday
afternoon
house
republican
conference
chair
liz
cheney
r-wy
condemned
king's
remarks
as
appalling
and
bizarre
and
once
again
called
for
his
resignation
having
done
so
previously
in
january
this
piece
has
been
updated
to
include
cheney's
remarks
