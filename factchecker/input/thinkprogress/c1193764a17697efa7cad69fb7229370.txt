native
votes
went
missing
in
north
carolina
tribal
leaders
vow
that
won't
happen
again
next
week
for
voting-rights
advocates
in
indian
country
the
nc-
do-over
vote
is
a
dry
run
ahead
of
the
election
native
american
voting
groups
have
made
it
their
mission
over
the
years
to
get
as
many
of
their
members
to
the
polls
as
possible
that
effort
has
even
greater
urgency
as
north
carolina
prepares
next
week
to
hold
one
of
its
most
closely
watched
elections
ever
the
voting-eligible
lumbee
tribal
members
living
in
north
carolina's
th
congressional
district
could
swing
the
special
election
for
the
tightly
contested
u.s.
house
race
pitting
republican
dan
bishop
against
democrat
dan
mccready
ahead
of
next
tuesday's
vote
tribal
members
have
been
knocking
on
doors
to
encourage
their
neighbors
to
get
out
to
the
polls
working
with
the
native
voting-rights
group
four
directions
more
than
two
dozen
members
of
the
lumbee
tribe
have
been
hired
to
visit
every
home
on
the
reservation
and
to
even
drive
people
to
the
polls
if
necessary
just
of
eligible
native
voters
cast
ballots
in
last
year's
election
harvey
godwin
jr
chair
of
the
lumbee
tribe
told
thinkprogress
that
there
are
various
reasons
that
fewer
native
people
turn
out
at
the
polls
than
he
would
like
and
not
all
of
them
have
to
do
with
voter
suppression
sometimes
people
don't
want
to
vote
sometimes
they
don't
have
transportation
and
a
lot
of
times
it's
apathy
godwin
said
adding
that
organizers
use
whatever
strategies
we
have
to
increase
the
number
of
people
at
the
polls
who
are
lumbees
however
it
seems
a
sound
bet
that
although
no
one
knows
for
sure
just
how
many
votes
from
the
lumbee
tribe
were
caught
up
in
the
election
fraud
voter
suppression
played
a
role
in
a
good
number
of
native
ballots
that
were
never
cast
last
year
republicans
then-candidate
mark
harris
garnered
around
more
votes
than
mccready
during
november's
midterm
election
for
the
congressional
seat
the
state
board
of
elections
ordered
a
new
special
election
however
after
it
was
discovered
that
longtime
republican
operative
mccrae
dowless
had
orchestrated
a
brazen
absentee
ballot
scheme
that
boosted
harris
vote
total
and
suppressed
votes
for
mccready
the
district's
residents
have
gone
without
congressional
representation
since
january
according
to
a
four
directions
analysis
of
all
requested
absentee
ballots
in
the
election
were
not
returned
in
robeson
county
the
jurisdiction
where
many
lumbee
tribe
members
live
that's
a
significantly
higher
percentage
than
the
statewide
rate
of
according
to
data
from
the
u.s.
census
bureau
and
the
north
carolina
board
of
elections
that
indian
votes
might
have
been
discarded
or
altered
angers
many
in
the
community
but
they
aren't
exactly
surprised
native
americans
were
not
guaranteed
the
right
to
vote
in
every
state
until
they
still
faced
a
flurry
of
barriers
expressly
designed
to
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
cast
a
ballot
in
recent
elections
native
people
in
some
states
have
been
forced
to
drive
hundreds
of
miles
to
cast
a
vote
overcome
restrictive
voter
id
laws
and
stare
down
intimidation
tactics
even
today
native
americans
in
republican-governed
precincts
remain
easy
targets
for
election
fraud
they
tend
to
vote
democratic
and
often
do
not
understand
election
law
once
turned
away
they
are
unlikely
to
return
to
a
polling
booth
i
think
the
right-wing
in
the
country
has
a
big
stake
in
depressing
the
votes
in
communities
that
are
impoverished
the
votes
in
communities
that
have
been
historically
denied
equity
in
society
as
a
whole
said
judith
leblanc
director
of
the
indian
advocacy
group
native
organizers
alliance
we
believe
given
the
atmosphere
in
the
country
and
the
use
of
racism
as
a
tool
to
divide
people
there
will
be
attempts
to
continue
to
depress
and
deny
the
vote
of
communities
of
color
and
indian
voters
especially
voter
suppression
in
indian
country
has
become
a
more
visible
issue
in
recent
years
during
the
frank
lamere
presidential
candidate
forum
in
sioux
city
last
month
a
number
of
democratic
candidates
pledged
to
fight
to
end
the
practice
if
elected
president
the
two-day
event
ended
with
u.s.
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
giving
an
impassioned
five-minute
speech
explaining
that
such
tactics
were
created
because
republicans
could
no
longer
win
elections
on
their
own
we're
going
to
take
on
voter
suppression
in
all
of
its
forms
that
means
you
don't
make
it
impossible
to
get
to
a
polling
place
which
was
your
case
it
also
means
we
move
to
a
system
that
says
very
simply
that
in
the
united
states
of
america
if
you
are
years
of
age
or
older
you
have
the
right
to
vote
end
of
discussion
the
senator
said
that's
not
the
current
reality
but
native
groups
are
vowing
to
fight
until
it
is
their
efforts
go
beyond
this
year's
election
however
the
nc-
race
is
a
dry-run
ahead
of
the
election
when
natives
expect
republican
voter
suppression
tactics
to
be
turbocharged
the
goal
of
native
organizers
heading
into
the
presidential
election
is
to
rally
historically
high
indian
voter
turnout
in
competitive
swing
states
like
arizona
nevada
michigan
wisconsin
minnesota
colorado
as
well
as
north
carolina
lumbee
tribal
members
need
to
drive
long
distances
to
the
polls
or
cast
a
ballot
in
front
of
mostly
white
poll
workers
who
may
not
always
be
accommodating
once
they
finally
arriving
at
their
voting
precincts
native
poll
watchers
will
be
on
hand
to
ensure
that
natives
are
not
being
wrongfully
denied
their
right
to
vote
in
north
carolina
they
are
conducting
get-out-the-vote
campaigns
and
monitoring
the
polls
to
ensure
indian
votes
are
actually
counted
sometimes
however
organizing
isn't
enough
and
activists
have
had
to
resort
to
the
courts
to
ensure
that
native
votes
are
counted
in
for
example
courts
ruled
in
favor
of
the
oglala
sioux
tribe
in
a
pair
of
lawsuits
against
two
south
dakota
counties
the
ruling
significantly
reduced
the
long
distances
that
tribal
members
living
on
the
pine
ridge
indian
reservation
needed
to
travel
to
make
it
to
the
polls
