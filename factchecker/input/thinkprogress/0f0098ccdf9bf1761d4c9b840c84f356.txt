hurricane
dorian's
impacts
could
be
resounding
here's
what
to
watch
for
the
storm
could
hit
florida
as
a
category
hurricane
in
the
next
few
days
hurricane
dorian
is
gaining
speed
as
it
nears
the
florida
coast
where
it
could
make
landfall
as
a
category
storm
over
the
labor
day
weekend
and
when
dorian
does
roar
ashore
its
impact
could
be
massive
the
hurricane
mostly
avoided
puerto
rico
and
other
vulnerable
islands
earlier
this
week
many
of
which
are
still
recovering
from
deadly
storms
in
years
past
but
parts
of
florida
and
the
southeast
have
not
fully
recovered
including
the
panhandle
which
is
still
reeling
from
hurricane
michael
in
vulnerable
communities
may
be
unable
to
evacuate
while
toxic
sites
pose
a
safety
hazard
for
humans
and
the
environment
alike
as
of
friday
morning
the
national
hurricane
center
nhc
said
that
dorian
was
growing
stronger
with
a
path
encircling
all
of
florida
other
nearby
states
such
as
georgia
and
south
carolina
will
also
likely
be
hit
among
the
vulnerable
cities
is
miami
already
dubbed
ground
zero
for
climate
change
if
the
storm's
path
holds
dorian
will
make
landfall
slightly
north
of
the
city
around
west
palm
beach
gov
ron
desantis
r
has
declared
a
state
of
emergency
and
warned
residents
to
take
immediate
precautions
every
florida
resident
should
have
seven
days
of
supplies
including
food
water
and
medicine
and
should
have
a
plan
in
case
of
disaster
desantis
advised
earlier
this
week
exactly
when
dorian
will
make
landfall
and
what
its
impacts
will
be
is
unclear
but
based
on
prior
major
hurricanes
there
are
a
few
things
to
look
out
for
how
destructive
dorian
is
could
depend
less
on
its
wind
speed
and
more
on
what
happens
when
the
storm
reaches
land
climate
scientists
have
found
that
warming
waters
are
allowing
storms
to
grow
larger
and
wetter
as
they
suck
up
more
moisture
while
passing
over
the
ocean
these
types
of
storms
typically
stall
after
making
landfall
unleashing
a
torrent
of
rain
those
downpours
can
be
devastating
especially
in
places
already
prone
to
flooding
linked
to
sea
level
rise
like
miami
and
rising
seas
mean
that
storm
surges
can
move
farther
inland
according
to
nhc
director
ken
graham
a
category
storm
like
this
striking
florida
could
produce
a
storm
surge
of
foot
or
greater
if
dorian
moves
slowly
it
will
allow
for
more
rain
to
fall
thereby
increasing
the
likelihood
of
flooding
rain
estimates
for
dorian
vary
but
some
forecasts
warn
at
least
eight
inches
of
rain
with
up
to
two
feet
possible
the
united
states
has
experienced
several
of
these
slow-moving
storms
in
recent
years
hurricane
harvey
a
category
storm
deluged
southeast
texas
in
killing
dozens
and
causing
around
billion
in
damage
hurricane
florence
which
hit
the
carolinas
and
neighboring
states
in
was
only
a
category
but
the
storm's
rains
submerged
the
region
turning
one
town
temporarily
into
an
island
florida
has
a
number
of
sites
on
the
superfund
national
priorities
list
which
singles
out
dangerously
contaminated
areas
for
cleanup
by
the
u.s.
government
when
superfund
sites
flood
toxic
chemicals
can
spread
harming
both
human
health
and
the
environment
broward
county
florida
is
home
to
one
of
the
nation's
worst
hazardous
waste
sites
where
around
gallons
of
oil
and
pollutants
are
still
sitting
that
county
could
be
deeply
impacted
by
dorian
given
the
storm's
current
path
leaving
residents
potentially
exposed
to
dangerous
toxins
following
the
storm
according
to
the
public
interest
network
pirg
a
nonpartisan
coalition
of
organizations
another
source
of
concern
are
coal
ash
ponds
those
are
found
in
areas
across
the
state
and
could
pose
a
major
health
hazard
if
impacted
by
dorian
similarly
animal
operations
are
common
in
agriculture-heavy
parts
of
florida
in
for
example
hurricane
florence
caused
hog
lagoons
to
breach
in
north
carolina
imperiling
water
supplies
dorian
could
spur
similar
contamination
in
florida
and
elsewhere
florida's
st
lucie
nuclear
power
plant
in
st
lucie
county
also
could
be
impacted
the
plant
is
located
north
of
west
palm
beach
well
within
the
hurricane's
potential
range
disasters
take
a
disproportionate
toll
on
vulnerable
groups
the
elderly
and
disabled
are
often
unable
to
evacuate
as
are
many
low-income
communities
preparing
for
a
hurricane
is
time-consuming
and
expensive
to
begin
with
and
leaving
is
even
more
so
in
the
southern
united
states
which
has
a
high
poverty
rate
individuals
and
families
frequently
stay
and
take
their
chances
due
to
cost
and
accessibility
issues
some
people
aren't
given
the
option
to
leave
prisons
are
generally
left
to
fend
for
themselves
during
hurricanes
even
as
incarcerated
labor
is
often
utilized
for
disaster
preparation
like
filling
sandbags
south
carolina
infamously
did
not
evacuate
its
prisons
during
hurricane
florence
desantis
has
said
that
state
prisoners
will
be
placed
in
fortified
facilities
but
that
private
and
federal
prisons
are
not
florida's
responsibility
undocumented
immigrants
are
also
caught
in
limbo
as
hurricane
harvey
approached
texas
in
immigration
checkpoints
briefly
remained
in
force
prompting
many
residents
to
stay
in
place
rather
than
risk
scrutiny
and
a
year
later
undocumented
communities
grappled
over
whether
to
evacuate
from
the
north
carolina
coast
as
florence
bore
down
such
a
scenario
could
play
out
again
in
florida
with
dire
implications
for
one
especially
vulnerable
group
the
state's
farmworkers
across
the
southeast
and
gulf
coast
many
areas
are
still
rebuilding
after
recent
hurricanes
in
prior
years
one
of
the
most
devastated
regions
is
the
florida
panhandle
where
hurricane
michael
wiped
an
entire
town
off
the
map
last
year
in
may
aid
workers
told
thinkprogress
that
the
situation
in
the
panhandle
was
among
the
worst
they
had
ever
seen
buildings
largely
remain
destroyed
resources
were
running
low
and
residents
continued
to
be
worried
for
their
future
some
models
show
dorian
veering
towards
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
path
that
would
put
the
storm
into
direct
contact
with
the
panhandle
florida
state
emergency
director
jared
moskowitz
has
called
that
the
worst-case
scenario
one
that
could
bring
further
crisis
upon
an
already-devastated
region
the
panhandle
isn't
alone
hurricane
irma
in
caused
heavy
flooding
and
rainfall
in
much
of
eastern
florida
as
of
many
communities
in
the
state
are
still
recovering
from
the
storm
including
those
who
lost
their
homes
to
the
hurricane
president
donald
trump's
administration
made
the
decision
this
year
to
divert
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
funds
from
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
fema
to
boost
border
security
programs
but
the
president
may
regret
that
choice
mar-a-lago
a
resort
and
historic
landmark
owned
by
trump
is
located
in
palm
beach
a
short
distance
from
west
palm
beach
where
dorian
could
make
landfall
