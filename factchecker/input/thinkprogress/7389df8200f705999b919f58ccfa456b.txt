address
high
on
the
list
reversing
the
ban
on
transgender
troops
and
addressing
the
plight
of
lgbtq
people
of
color
a
prominent
lgbtq
rights
organization
the
human

campaign
hrc
announced

that
it
will
host
a
presidential
town

lgbtq
advocacy
groups
told

that
they
know
exactly
what
ideas
they
want
to
hear
discussed
at
the
town
hall
set
for
oct
which
is
national
coming
out
day
many
said
that
first
and
foremost
they
want
candidates
to
acknowledge
the
struggles
of
the
most
marginalized
in
the
community
including
lgbtq
people
of
color
and
put
forward
policies
to
respond
to
anti-lgbtq
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
lgbtq
people
are
more
likely
to
come
into
contact
with
the
police
due
to
discriminatory
policing
be
incarcerated
and
experience
violence
while
locked
up
than
non-lgbtq
people
black
and
latinx
lgbtq
people
are
most
impacted
tyrone
hanley
senior
policy
counsel
for
the
national
center
for
lesbian
rights
told
thinkprogress
hanley
said
that
aspirants
to
the
white
house
must
put
criminal
justice
reform
as
one
of
the
issues
topping
their
list
candidates
must
demonstrate
an
understanding
that
anti-lgbtq
discrimination
and
violence
is
impacted
by
issues
of
race
gender
and
class
just
as
they
are
for
other
communities
he
said
the
town
hall
comes
at
a
critical
time
as
the
trump
administration
has
rolled
back
health-care
protections
for
transgender
people
and
protections
for
transgender
students
implemented
a
ban
on
transgender
people
in
the
military
and
proposed
a
rule
that
allows
broad
religious
exemptions
for
businesses
with
federal

who
reach
at

in
four
national
polls
chosen
by
the
democratic
national
committee
dnc
and
who
have
met
the
dnc's

the
candidates

answer
questions
from
cnn
journalists
and
the
members
of
the
audience
at
back-to-back
town
halls
over
the
course
of
the
evening
lgbtq
advocates
have
a
broad
range
of
issues
on
their
list
of
topics
they
want
to
see
discussed
shannon
minter
legal
director
of
the
national
center
for
lesbian
rights
said
he'd
like
to
see
how
each
candidate
stands
on
reversing
the
president's
ban
on
military
service
by
transgender
troops
minter
said
he
would
like
the
candidates
to
acknowledge
that
health
care
poverty
and
food
insecurity
are
all
lgbtq
issues
and
he
added
the
candidates
should
also
demonstrate
how
they
would
carry
on
the
progress
of
the
obama
administration
when
it
comes
to
tackling
the
issue
of
conversion
therapy
programs
in
which
young
people
are
told
they
can
and
should
change
their
sexual
orientation
and
in
some
cases
their
gender
the
american
medical
association
has
said
conversion
therapy
especially
in
youth
may
cause
significant
psychological
distress
while
regulating
that
issue
falls
primarily
to
the
states
president
obama's
department
of
health
and
human
services
issued
a
groundbreaking
report
on
the
harms
caused
to
minors
by
conversion
therapy
in
that
has
played
a
key
role
in
supporting
state
legislation
minter
said
we
would
very
much
like
to
see
candidates
pledge
to
continue
and
expand
such
educational
efforts
the
president's
voice
is
powerful
and
we
urgently
need
national
leadership
on
this
issue
which
poses
such
a
severe
threat
to
the
health
and
well-being
of
lgbtq
youth
stacey
long
simmons
director
of
advocacy
and
action
for
the
national
lgbtq
task
force
echoed
the
views
of
others
in
saying
that
the
presidential
candidates
should
focus
on
the
community's
most
vulnerable
populations
when
we
are
having
conversations
with
policymakers
we
typically
ask
about
issues
affecting
members
of
our
community
who
are
most
deeply
marginalized
and
in
particular
thinking
about
people
who
may
have
multiple
marginalized
identities
long
simmons
said
they
may
be
undocumented
or
transgender
or
gender-nonconforming
they
may
be
racial
minorities
or
religious
minorities
all
of
those
things
are
things
we
tend
to
highlight
when
we're
in
conversations
with
people
she
said
she
added
that
candidates
have
to
understand
how
all
issues
connect
to
the
lgbtq
community
and
roll
back
many
of
the
anti-lgbtq
policies
of
the
trump
administration
which
have
undone
much
of
the
work
of
the
obama
administration
to
bolster
lgbtq
rights
there's
not
an
issue
out
there
that
is
being
discussed
that
doesn't
directly
impact
members
of
our
community
she
said
we
would
want
to
be
involved
in
as
many
ways
possible
to
shape
policy
because
we
know
that
given
the
way
society
is
structured
whether
it's
climate
change
or
healthcare
policy
or
criminal
justice
policy
all
of
the
things
decision-makers
put
out
affect
our
community
and
so
we
want
to
make
sure
they
don't
worsen
some
of
the
conditions
we're
currently
grappling
with
in
a
statement
to
thinkprogress
sharon
mcgowan
chief
strategy
officer
and
legal
director
at
lambda
legal
said
that
candidates
need
to
explain
how
they
would
use
all
of
the
tools
at
their
disposal
including
the
bully
pulpit
executive
powers
and
legislative
acton
where
possible
to
address
and
reverse
the
policies
of
the
trump
administration
mcgowan
said
of
these
policies
these
harms
include
this
administration's
weaponization
of
religion
as
an
enemy
of
civil
rights
protections
for
lgbtq
people
among
others
and
the
ways
in
which
this
administration
has
taken
aim
at
the
most
vulnerable
in
our
community
including
transgender
people
young
people
and
lgbtq
people
of
color
she
said
lambda
legal
would
also
like
to
see
the
candidates
discuss
the
damage
that
has
been
done
to
the
federal
judiciary
by
the
appointment
of
scores
of
anti-lgbtq
ideologues
to
lifetime
positions
on
the
federal
bench
and
how
they
intend
to
address
this
crisis
as
other
organizations
have
said
mcgowan
said
candidates
need
to
understand
that
all
policy
issues
whether
they
be
safe
schools
police
misconduct
and
treatment
in
government
custody
are
all
lgbtq
issues
in
his
statement
announcing
the
town
hall
hrc
president
alphonso
david
said
that
despite
enormous
gains
in
the
past
decade
there
remain
a
number
of
areas
where
lgbtq
people
face
discrimination
and
disadvantages
because
of
who
we
are
today
in
states
lgbtq
people
remain
at
risk
of
being
fired
evicted
or
denied
services
because
of
who
we
are
thirty-five
states
have
yet
to
ban
the
dangerous
and
debunked
practice
of
conversion
therapy
which
is
harming
our
young
people
hate
crimes
are
rising
and
more
than
transgender
people
most
of
whom
are
transgender
women
of
color
have
been
killed
in
the
united
states
in
the
last
five
years

first
presidential
