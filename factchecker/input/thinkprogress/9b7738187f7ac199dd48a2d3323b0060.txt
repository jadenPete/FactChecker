toni
morrison
taught
me
many
things
but
one
lesson
utterly
changed
my
life
i
came
to
understand
the
power
of
her
understated
slow-burning
anger
i've
always
known
what
i
would
say
about
toni
morrison
after
she
died
it's
the
same
thing
i'd
have
liked
to
have
said
to
have
thanked
her
for
in
person
since
her
death
last
week
tributes
have
poured
in
for
morrison
america's
foremost
black
woman
writer
who
transformed
the
world
with
her
words
she
was
a
literary
matriarch
for
black
people
and
introduced
many
white
people
to
what
it
means
to
be
black
in
america
its
beauty
and
its
pain
its
history
and
its
rich
heritage
all
of
it
was
lovingly
documented
in
her
books
and
unbeknownst
to
her
toni
morrison
also
helped
a
young
black
woman
let
go
of
her
anger
her
words
worked
this
magic
on
me
as
a
college
student
several
years
ago
on
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland
the
setting
was
a
class
that
would
cover
every
book
in
morrison's
extensive
catalogue
i
was
the
only
african
american
in
an
undergraduate
classroom
filled
with
white
women
before
taking
the
course
i
had
tried
before
in
fits
and
starts
to
read
beloved
now
i
would
have
the
chance
to
fully
explore
this
seminal
work
and
all
the
other
writings
by
this
living
legend
but
i
was
seeking
something
else
as
well
a
kind
of
validation
for
pain
i
had
been
storing
away
the
class
started
with
morrison's
debut
novel
the
bluest
eye
a
sober
reflection
on
the
pain
black
women
and
girls
sometimes
endure
i
identified
immediately
with
her
heroine
a
black
girl
angered
about
her
disadvantages
in
life
desperate
in
her
search
for
self-worth
i
also
felt
a
kinship
with
violet
the
lead
character
in
jazz
whose
angst
and
anger
felt
like
my
own
who
after
all
hasn't
been
so
enraged
over
a
heartbreaking
betrayal
that
they
would
stab
the
corpse
at
the
funeral
and
of
course
there
was
nel
in
sula
unable
to
contend
with
her
deep-seated
resentments
and
then
there
was
me
i
was
not
a
character
created
by
morrison
but
i
sometimes
felt
as
if
i
could
have
been
increasingly
frustrated
with
my
life
seething
in
what
i
thought
was
a
universal
sisterhood
of
black
victimhood
it
was
morrison
who
taught
me
what
to
do
with
that
rage
with
her
eloquent
explorations
of
the
anger
that
being
a
black
woman
can
elicit
some
of
her
most
insightful
remarks
on
the
topic
were
voiced
not
in
her
writings
but
in
an
interview
from
decades
ago
surprisingly
far
from
embracing
the
anger
exhibited
by
some
of
her
most
poignant
characters
morrison
said
she
had
no
use
for
it
calling
it
a
paralyzing
emotion
people
sort
of
think
it's
an
interesting
passionate
and
igniting
feeling
i
don't
think
it's
any
of
that
it's
helpless
it's
absence
of
control
she
told
cbs
radio
host
don
swaim
in
the
interview
i
need
all
of
my
skills
all
of
the
control
all
of
my
powers
and
anger
doesn't
provide
any
of
that
i
have
no
use
for
it
whatsoever
at
the
time
i
was
taking
this
class
waking
up
each
day
at
dawn
i
was
approaching
graduation
in
the
spring
i
was
contemplating
my
own
trajectory
as
an
aspiring
writer
as
a
student
journalist
and
as
a
woman
the
eruption
of
black
lives
matter
as
a
potent
force
on
the
political
stage
was
mere
months
away
and
social
justice
warriors
of
color
were
picking
up
steam
online
i
was
anxious
angry
and
growing
more
radical
early
in
her
life
morrison
endured
growing
up
black
in
ohio
in
the
s
and
s
and
also
literary
critics
hell-bent
on
misunderstanding
her
she
had
faced
down
divorce
and
the
death
of
a
son
in
class
we
played
back
the
interview
and
i
lingered
over
the
part
when
she
was
asked
when
she
would
write
about
white
characters
we
watched
the
video
holding
our
collective
breath
as
morrison
took
a
sip
of
water
then
responded
with
the
poise
of
a
well-rested
prima
ballerina
on
opening
night
you
can't
understand
how
powerfully
racist
that
question
is
can
you
morrison
says
calmly
because
you
can
never
ask
a
white
author
when
are
you
going
to
write
about
black
people
even
the
inquiry
comes
from
a
place
of
being
in
the
centre
morrison
continues
it's
clear
morrison
made
her
case
because
the
interviewer
australian
journalist
jana
wendt
apologetically
adds
and
being
used
to
being
in
the
center
understanding
washed
over
me
after
reading
those
words
all
of
morrison's
characters
were
depicted
in
completely
different
colors
i
realized
that
i
had
found
this
world
where
being
a
black
woman
came
without
restrictions
through
morrison
i
saw
what
to
do
with
anger
listen
to
it
but
interrogate
it
do
not
make
it
welcome
for
long
and
eventually
set
yourself
free
morrison
talked
a
lot
about
freedom
and
how
once
you
get
a
taste
it's
your
responsibility
to
free
someone
else
she
created
characters
who
spoke
my
language
they
sounded
like
my
mom
and
her
sisters
some
of
her
male
characters
reminded
me
of
my
older
brother
and
his
goon
squad
of
friends
but
most
importantly
her
women
were
black
messy
emotional
heartbroken
angry
and
always
found
a
way
to
be
their
own
heroes
by
the
end
of
the
class
it
became
clear
to
me
that
morrison
was
using
these
characters
not
to
indulge
her
anger
pain
and
heartbreak
about
this
world
but
to
release
it
she
was
regaining
her
emotional
agency
and
thus
able
to
be
creative
and
legendary
we
make
something
out
of
our
pain
we
do
not
let
it
fester
because
we
have
no
use
for
it
whatsoever
