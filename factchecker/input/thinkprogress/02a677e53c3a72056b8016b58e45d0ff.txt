bill
cosby's
conviction
was
a
metoo
triumph
now
his
defense
wants
it
reversed
the
disgraced
entertainer's
lawyers
are
looking
to
have
his
conviction
overturned
it's
a
popular
line
of
thinking
that
the
metoo
movement
began
in
when
stand-up
comedian
hannibal
burress
made
a
joke
about
the
open
secret
of
bill
cosby's
long
rumored
sexual
misconduct
effectively
bringing
the
disgraced
year-old
entertainer's
sordid
past
into
full
view
it's
probably
more
accurate
to
say
however
that
the
scandal
has
been
roiling
since
at
least
in
when
andrea
constand
dared
to
accuse
the
world
famous
actor
and
comedian
of
a
sexual
assault
she
said
took
place
one
evening
at
his
home
in
the
parties
settled
out
of
court
closing
the
case
perhaps
for
good
being
the
hopes
of
cosby's
defense
team
the
re-emergence
of
the
case
years
later
brought
renewed
interest
in
his
misconduct
the
stories
of
at
least
more
accusers
and
last
year
when
a
court
found
cosby
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
three
to
years
in
prison
the
first
major
victory
of
the
metoo
movement
for
accusers
on
monday
cosby's
defense
team
reminded
the
world
just
how
fleeting
those
victories
can
be
as
his
attorneys
officially
began
their
appeal
process
a
three-judge
superior
court
panel
hears
arguments
in
the
case
on
monday
and
it
is
not
expected
that
they
will
rule
for
at
least
a
few
months
cosby
is
serving
a
three-
to
year
prison
term
in
pennsylvania
after
a
jury
found
him
guilty
of
having
drugged
and
molested
constand
in
his
defense
team
contends
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial
last
year
the
judge
erred
in
allowing
five
other
accusers
to
testify
which
prejudiced
jurors
against
him
this
case
was
a
touchstone
for
the
metoo
movement
an
overturned
conviction
after
such
a
major
victory
wouldn't
just
be
complicated
for
his
accusers
but
it
could
potentially
open
the
floodgates
for
the
whole
movement
right
now
the
courts
both
the
judicial
one
and
the
court
of
public
opinion
are
litigating
the
case
of
hollywood
mogul
and
accused
serial
sex
abuser
harvey
weinstein
other
notable
men
who
have
been
accused
of
sexual
misconduct
have
landed
somewhere
on
the
spectrum
between
being
accused
and
convicted
like
cosby
and
full
scale
redemption
when
they
return
more
or
less
unscathed
to
careers
in
the
limelight
others
like
director
woody
allen
seem
to
elude
the
process
altogether
this
attempt
at
an
appeal
by
the
actor's
legal
team
after
the
battle
of
david
cosby's
accusers
versus
goliath
the
actor
and
his
intimidating
clout
and
money
could
give
false
hope
to
the
accused
or
further
discourage
victims
from
seeking
justice
if
the
decision
affirms
cosby's
guilt
then
he
will
remain
in
his
prison
cell
and
his
lawyers
can
try
to
persuade
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
hear
his
appeal
but
the
high
court
does
not
have
to
take
the
case
and
there
is
no
guarantee
it
will
