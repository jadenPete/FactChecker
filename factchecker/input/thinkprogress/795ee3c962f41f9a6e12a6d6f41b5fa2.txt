las
vegas
wnba
all-star
party
flipped
the
script
on
promoting
women's
sports
authenticity
and
athleticism
proved
to
be
a
winning
combination
there
were
plenty
of
things
to
love
about
the
wnba
all-star
game
in
las
vegas
last
weekend
the
skills
challenge
and
three-point
competition
on
friday
night
was
a
blast
the
players
were
treated
like
the
superstars
they
are
the
crowds
were
electric
and
the
game
itself
was
a
thrilling
victory
for
team
a'ja
wilson
over
team
elena
delle
donne
that
included
three
dunks
by
brittney
griner
and
one
of
the
most
emotional
inspiring
performances
in
wnba
history
by
indiana
fever
guard
erica
wheeler
an
undrafted
guard
who
was
named
the
mvp
of
the
game
it
was
amazing
definitely
one
of
the
best
that
i've
attended
said
six-time
all-star
sylvia
fowles
but
the
most
refreshing
part
of
the
weekend
the
host
city
really
pulled
out
all
the
stops
walking
around
vegas
there
were
signs
for
the
all-star
game
everywhere
from
billboards
to
casino
walls
to
public
transportation
and
none
of
them
included
inspirational
slogans
the
color
pink
or
rhetoric
about
supporting
women
they
weren't
focused
on
sex
appeal
either
the
ads
just
showcased
the
faces
of
the
most
elite
women's
basketball
players
in
the
world
along
with
the
name
date
and
time
of
the
event
simple
and
effective
nneka
ogwumike
an
all-star
forward
with
the
los
angeles
aces
and
the
president
of
the
wnba
players
association
was
impressed
with
the
visibility
of
the
advertisements
and
the
focus
on
basketball
above
all
else
it's
the
las
vegas
aces
it's
the
wnba
all-star
game
that's
all
she
excitedly
proclaimed
on
the
wnba's
orange
carpet
on
the
eve
of
the
game
megan
rapinoe
women's
world
cup
hero
and
star
of
the
seattle
reign
and
u.s.
women's
national
team
was
on
hand
in
vegas
to
support
her
girlfriend
wnba
star
sue
bird
she
too
was
thrilled
that
the
advertisements
across
the
city
didn't
go
out
of
their
way
to
express
the
inspirational
nature
of
the
of
the
sport
obviously
they're
going
to
inspire
girls
and
boys
playing
basketball
because
that's
where
they
want
to
get
but
to
always
lead
with
that
it
leaves
so
much
short
when
it
comes
to
the
potential
of
it
said
rapinoe
during
the
women's
world
cup
fifa
was
criticized
including
by
thinkprogress
for
its
patronizing
slogan
dare
to
dream
female
athletes
have
always
dreamed
fifa
and
other
organizations
at
the
top
of
the
sport
have
been
actively
destroying
those
dreams
by
failing
to
adequately
invest
in
women's
sports
but
fifa
is
far
from
the
only
organization
that
often
falls
back
on
promoting
women's
sports
as
a
social
justice
obligation
rather
than
entertainment
the
wnba
has
done
this
as
well
in
the
wnba
unveiled
its
take
a
seat
take
a
stand
campaign
which
was
a
women
and
girls
empowerment
program
it
leaned
heavily
on
marketing
the
wnba
as
part
of
the
broader
women's
movement
and
announced
that
a
portion
of
each
ticket
sale
would
be
dedicated
to
one
of
six
wnba
partners
including
planned
parenthood
and
the
united
states
of
women
all
of
this
was
on
the
surface
perfectly
nice
inspiring
and
on-brand
for
a
league
whose
players
have
been
outspoken
about
social
justice
issues
but
the
campaign
was
unveiled
without
input
from
the
players
and
some
were
upset
that
none
of
the
official
partners
were
associated
with
the
black
lives
matter
movement
or
ending
police
brutality
and
there
was
also
something
uncomfortable
about
so
heavily
tying
the
sport
to
charity
and
in
taking
a
portion
of
ticket
sales
away
from
the
wnba
itself
at
a
time
when
the
league
claims
it
can't
pay
the
players
more
but
most
importantly
the
league's
ad
campaign
seemed
to
forget
about
the
fact
that
people
should
support
wnba
games
because
they
are
physical
competitive
flashy
feisty
and
a
whole
lot
of
fun
there's
plenty
of
inspiration
on
the
court
for
every
game
it
doesn't
have
to
be
manufactured
by
marketing
consultants
last
month
the
wnba's
new
commissioner
cathy
engelbert
came
on
board
after
a
long
career
as
the
ceo
of
deloitte
a
professional
services
firm
since
she
comes
from
the
corporate
world
she's
expected
to
be
focused
primarily
on
turning
the
league
into
a
profitable
business
but
in
a
conversation
with
thinkprogress
three
days
into
her
tenure
engelbert
repeatedly
stressed
that
she
took
the
job
with
the
wnba
because
she
wanted
to
do
something
with
a
broad
women's
leadership
platform
when
asked
whether
she
viewed
the
wnba
as
a
sport
or
a
cause
engelbert
said
that
both
were
in
play
i
think
that's
what
makes
the
w
so
unique
is
that
these
things
aren't
mutually
exclusive
with
one
another
you
can
have
very
socially
minded
community
oriented
elite
athletes
playing
a
game
they
love
broadening
the
fan
base
but
always
knowing
that
they
ultimately
have
a
maybe
a
broader
mission
behind
what
they're
doing
she
said
so
you
kind
of
have
to
follow
the
athlete
following
the
athlete
is
an
important
step
in
the
summer
of
the
wnba
brass
created
tension
with
its
players
when
it
tried
to
quell
black
lives
matter
protests
many
wnba
players
identify
as
activists
and
should
be
encouraged
to
use
their
voices
and
platform
but
if
there's
no
interest
in
the
platform
itself
then
their
voices
won't
be
amplified
they'll
be
lost
in
the
abyss
female
athletes
aren't
always
going
to
be
perfect
role
models
the
biggest
stars
might
not
always
be
comfortable
being
the
faces
of
political
movements
or
advocates
for
change
so
relying
on
those
two
things
as
the
main
selling
point
of
the
league
is
precarious
at
best
the
wnba
has
come
a
long
way
since
its
early
days
it
now
celebrates
the
individuality
of
its
players
both
through
their
pre-game
styles
and
by
being
more
openly
welcoming
to
those
who
are
lesbian
bisexual
and
or
gender
nonconforming
in
las
vegas
last
weekend
married
chicago
sky
teammates
allie
quigley
and
courtney
vandersloot
were
both
all-stars
they
walked
the
orange
carpet
together
and
were
interviewed
about
playing
against
each
other
it
was
wonderful
to
see
their
relationship
out
in
the
open
and
celebrated
but
it
was
also
wonderful
that
this
was
just
a
fun
side
story
to
the
main
event
a
basketball
game
between
the
best
players
in
the
world
as
rapinoe
said
the
focus
on
these
female
athletes
doesn't
have
to
end
with
the
sport
itself
but
it
should
always
start
there
in
vegas
it
was
confirmed
that
not
only
is
this
approach
possible
it's
downright
popular
