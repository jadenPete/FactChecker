boris
johnson's
brexit
plans
have
been
derailed
thanks
to
members
of
his
own
party
absolutely
incredible
scenes
as
some
conservatives
grow
a
spine
and
stand
up
for
their
political
principles
before
tuesday
it
was
unlikely
that
too
many
people
outside
his
constituency
of
bracknell
in
berkshire
england
would
have
heard
of
member
of
parliament
mp
phillip
lee
but
on
yet
another
day
of
high
parliament
drama
over
the
seemingly-endless
saga
of
brexit
the
conservative
tory
mp
thrust
himself
into
the
spotlight
by
publicly
defecting
to
the
opposition
figuratively
and
quite
literally
joining
the
liberal
democrats
seated
in
the
chamber
in
doing
so
lee
left
the
government
of
boris
johnson
without
a
working
majority
thereby
severely
damaging
his
attempts
to
pass
through
his
preferred
form
of
brexit
the
conservative
government
is
aggressively
pursuing
a
damaging
brexit
in
unprincipled
ways
it
is
putting
lives
and
livelihoods
at
risk
unnecessarily
and
it
is
wantonly
endangering
the
integrity
of
the
united
kingdom
lee
said
in
a
statement
it
is
using
political
manipulation
bullying
and
lies
and
it
is
doing
these
things
in
a
deliberate
and
considered
way
in
a
later
interview
lee
revealed
that
he
decided
to
defect
after
he
listened
to
a
radio
discussion
on
lbc
between
a
doctor
and
arch-brexiteer
jacob
rees-mogg
rees-mogg
a
conservative
mp
said
that
the
doctor's
concern
that
some
patients
could
die
due
to
medicine
shortages
after
a
potential
no-deal
brexit
was
deeply
irresponsible
and
accused
him
of
trying
to
spread
fear
across
the
country
rees-mogg
for
his
part
woke
up
on
wednesday
to
discover
that
he'd
become
a
global
meme
as
an
image
emerged
of
him
slouched
on
the
benches
inside
the
house
of
commons
looking
like
a
victorian
aristocrat
in
an
opium
den
lee's
defection
and
his
very
public
snipe
at
rees-mogg
highlights
the
conservative
party's
civil
war
at
the
heart
of
the
torturous
never-ending
brexit
debate
the
tories
have
always
been
deeply
fractured
as
to
whether
britain
would
be
better
off
in
or
outside
the
european
union
former
conservative
prime
minister
david
cameron
for
instance
called
the
brexit
referendum
in
in
an
attempt
to
unite
his
party's
warring
factions
theresa
may
the
prime
minister
who
preceded
johnson
and
who
spent
much
of
her
tenure
glumly
trying
to
get
parliament
to
agree
on
a
brexit
deal
also
supported
cameron's
line
that
britain
would
be
better
off
in
the
e.u.
but
like
a
bunch
of
dithering
college
undergrads
confronted
with
a
term
paper
the
looming
october
st
deadline
for
crashing
out
of
the
e.u.
has
led
to
a
last-minute
scramble
among
both
pro-
and
anti-brexit
factions
within
the
conservative
party
to
get
what
they
want
last
week
johnson
suspended
parliament
for
five
weeks
in
an
attempt
to
reduce
the
amount
of
time
mps
had
to
block
a
no-deal
scenario
on
tuesday
night
johnson
doubled
down
again
by
expelling
mps
from
the
conservative
party
all
of
whom
had
adamantly
refused
to
allow
johnson
to
leave
the
e.u.
without
a
deal
in
a
sign
of
just
how
bitter
the
civil
war
has
become
the
expulsion
included
phillip
hammond
former
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
under
theresa
may
the
second-most
important
position
in
the
british
government
and
nicholas
soames
the
grandson
of
winston
churchill
but
on
wednesday
the
rebels
struck
back
inflicting
a
humiliating
to
defeat
where
a
cross-party
section
of
lawmakers
voted
to
control
the
parliamentary
agenda
meaning
they
can
move
forward
with
a
plan
to
prevent
a
no-deal
brexit
a
second
reading
of
the
bill
on
wednesday
passed
by
votes
to
johnson
has
vehemently
opposed
such
a
move
arguing
that
it
gives
the
e.u.
more
negotiating
power
in
response
johnson
said
that
he'd
have
no
choice
but
to
call
an
early
general
election
this
may
sound
good
from
an
outside
perspective
but
there
is
absolutely
no
guarantee
that
an
election
would
bring
about
the
defeat
of
johnson
and
the
stopping
of
brexit
as
thinkprogress
has
previously
pointed
out
johnson
could
use
the
election
to
essentially
re-litigate
the
referendum
painting
himself
as
the
only
politician
who
can
deliver
the
supposed
will
of
the
people
bearing
in
mind
the
divisions
in
the
labour
party
over
brexit
and
the
rise
of
the
brexit
party
it
is
entirely
possible
that
brexiteers
rally
around
johnson
and
deliver
him
a
general
election
victory
which
would
in
turn
allow
him
to
potentially
push
through
a
no-deal
brexit
as
well
as
give
him
another
four
years
of
governing
to
make
matters
even
more
complicated
there's
no
guarantee
that
parliament
will
vote
to
authorize
a
general
election
johnson
needs
the
support
of
two
thirds
of
parliament
to
allow
a
general
election
to
take
place
and
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
has
made
it
clear
that
he
will
only
allow
a
general
election
if
the
rebels
are
allowed
to
enact
their
law
guarding
against
no-deal
as
ever
with
brexit
no
one
has
a
clear
idea
of
precisely
what
will
happen
next
the
only
thing
for
certain
is
that
the
houses
of
parliament
are
likely
to
see
unprecedented
levels
of
drama
over
the
next
two
weeks
