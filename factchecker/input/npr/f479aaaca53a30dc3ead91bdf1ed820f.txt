et
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
unveiled
her
long-anticipated
plan
to
lower
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
on
thursday
it
is
a
priority
shared
by
president
trump
fueling
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
there
is
a
deal
to
be
had
on
the
issue
ahead
of
the
elections
it
is
transformative
pelosi
said
of
her
plan
we
do
hope
to
have
white
house
buy-in
the
speaker's
proposal
calls
for
the
federal
government
through
the
health
and
human
services
secretary
to
negotiate
annually
prices
for
the
top
most
expensive
drugs
on
the
market
that
don't
have
at
least
two
competitors
the
price
determined
by
the
negotiations
would
be
available
to
all
purchasers
not
just
medicare
beneficiaries
the
amounts
would
be
pegged
to
the
costs
of
the
same
drugs
in
other
countries
which
are
generally
much
cheaper
under
an
international
price
index
it
would
also
levy
steep
fines
starting
at
of
the
gross
sales
of
the
drug
on
drug
companies
that
refuse
to
engage
in
negotiations
and
limit
how
much
drug
costs
can
go
up
this
steep
escalating
penalty
creates
a
powerful
financial
incentive
for
drug
manufacturers
to
negotiate
and
abide
by
the
final
price
the
proposal
states
the
plan
calls
for
reinvesting
the
taxpayer
money
saved
in
negotiations
back
into
drug
research
at
the
national
institutes
of
health
the
proposal
also
includes
a
out-of-pocket
cap
on
prescription
drugs
for
medicare
beneficiaries
and
the
disabled
pelosi
told
reporters
the
proposal
was
not
the
last
word
this
is
an
introduction
so
much
more
will
be
added
in
the
committee
process
and
the
public
review
of
it
but
we're
very
excited
about
it
and
happy
that
we
can
give
some
hope
to
people
that
help
is
on
the
way
she
said
however
she
said
empowering
the
hhs
secretary
to
negotiate
drug
prices
must
be
included
in
any
final
bill
it
is
rare
for
the
speaker
to
take
an
early
and
formative
role
in
crafting
a
bill
policy
work
generally
left
to
committees
so
pelosi's
engagement
on
the
issue
sends
a
clear
message
that
the
bill
is
a
top
priority
for
the
party
her
office
has
been
quietly
negotiating
the
details
of
the
proposal
for
months
which
pelosi
has
run
by
moderate
and
progressive
factions
within
the
democratic
caucus
ahead
of
thursday's
official
release
the
speaker
met
tuesday
evening
with
the
blue
dog
coalition
a
faction
of
moderates
who
often
represent
many
of
the
party's
swing
seats
we
appreciate
that
speaker
pelosi
took
the
time
to
meet
with
the
blue
dogs
to
discuss
a
path
forward
to
lower
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
rep
stephanie
murphy
d-fla
a
co-chair
of
the
coalition
said
in
a
statement
our
constituents
want
to
see
solutions
implemented
today
and
we
hope
house
republicans
will
join
in
coming
forward
with
bold
solutions
to
bring
down
drug
costs
and
increase
transparency
surrounding
drug
pricing
a
source
at
the
blue
dog
meeting
said
lawmakers
were
particularly
eager
to
change
the
conversation
in
the
house
members
would
like
to
be
talking
less
about
impeachment
and
more
about
an
issue
that
their
constituents
are
bringing
up
at
every
town
hall
back
home
the
source
said
we're
eager
to
see
the
legislation
itself
committees
are
expected
to
take
up
the
legislation
as
soon
as
next
week
with
the
goal
of
passing
it
out
of
the
house
by
the
end
of
the
year
there
are
only
legislative
days
left
in
the
non-partisan
congressional
budget
office
has
not
yet
released
an
evaluation
on
the
proposal's
costs
and
savings
pelosi's
proposal
is
the
most
sweeping
plan
on
the
table
and
while
traditional
republicans
are
sure
to
object
it
includes
ideas
that
president
trump
has
indicated
in
the
past
he
could
support
to
help
drive
down
drug
prices
for
americans
if
the
speaker
and
the
president
could
come
to
an
agreement
democrats
believe
he
could
bring
enough
republicans
on
board
to
get
it
through
congress
and
signed
into
law
the
president
supports
a
drug
price
index
and
the
administration
is
reviewing
a
possible
executive
order
to
that
end
why
should
other
nations
like
canada
why
should
other
nations
pay
much
less
than
us
they've
taken
advantage
of
the
system
for
a
long
time
pharma
trump
told
reporters
in
july
he
also
used
his
state
of
the
union
address
earlier
this
year
to
call
for
action
to
lower
drug
costs
it
is
unacceptable
that
americans
pay
vastly
more
than
people
in
other
countries
for
the
exact
same
drugs
often
made
in
the
exact
same
place
this
is
wrong
this
is
unfair
and
together
we
will
stop
it
we
will
stop
it
fast
he
said
in
february
the
pharmaceutical
lobby
with
backing
from
gop
allies
opposes
any
effort
to
regulate
the
drug
market
this
proposal
crushes
the
desperate
hopes
of
patients
and
their
families
that
life
science
innovators
will
be
the
answer
to
their
prayers
said
jim
greenwood
president
of
the
biotechnology
innovation
organization
which
represents
biotechnology
companies
in
a
statement
in
response
to
the
plan
it
abandons
any
pretense
of
allowing
a
free
and
fair
market
system
to
determine
the
value
of
prescription
medicines
including
for
the
most
innovative
medical
breakthroughs
it
will
extinguish
any
incentive
for
investors
to
provide
the
necessary
funds
to
advance
biotech
medical
discovery
at
least
one
powerful
senate
republican
finance
committee
chairman
chuck
grassley
r-iowa
is
willing
to
buck
party
orthodoxy
to
get
a
bill
to
lower
drug
prices
grassley
and
sen
ron
wyden
d-ore
cut
a
deal
in
july
on
legislation
that
limits
out-of-pocket
costs
for
seniors
in
medicare's
part
d
prescription
drug
program
to
per
year
starting
in
grassley
moved
a
draft
version
of
that
proposal
out
of
committee
over
the
objection
of
most
republicans
on
the
senate
finance
panel
who
oppose
it
on
free-market
principles
his
proposal
is
more
modest
the
house
plan
would
regulate
drug
prices
more
aggressively
and
outside
the
scope
of
medicare
as
well
but
grassley
is
hoping
pelosi's
broader
bill
will
help
republicans
rally
around
his
grassley
has
been
pitching
his
proposal
to
senate
republicans
as
the
more
moderate
plan
on
an
issue
generally
popular
with
voters
everywhere
he
is
also
warning
republicans
that
if
they
do
not
coalesce
around
an
alternative
to
offer
to
the
president
for
his
support
trump
could
join
forces
with
pelosi
instead
a
spokesman
for
grassley
said
a
formal
text
of
his
legislation
will
be
introduced
soon
