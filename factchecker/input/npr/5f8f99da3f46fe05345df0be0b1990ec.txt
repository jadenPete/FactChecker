president
trump's
former
campaign
manager
jousted
with
house
democrats
on
the
judiciary
committee
tuesday
in
a
combative
hearing
that
each
side
hoped
might
strengthen
its
narrative
about
the
legacy
of
the
russia
imbroglio
corey
lewandowski
became
the
rare
trump
world
insider
to
meet
democrats
in
congress
eye
to
eye
and
he
went
on
offense
over
the
aftermath
of
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
into
russia's
attack
on
the
presidential
election
interest
in
the
fake
russia
collusion
narrative
has
fallen
apart
lewandowski
said
it's
now
clear
the
investigation
was
populated
by
many
trump
haters
who
had
their
own
agenda
then-president
barack
obama's
national
security
leaders
including
former
cia
director
john
brennan
and
former
fbi
director
james
comey
failed
to
defend
the
u.s.
in
against
the
russian
interference
lewandowski
alleged
he
also
declined
to
respond
to
the
substance
of
many
questions
by
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
and
other
democrats
who
asked
about
the
role
lewandowski
was
described
as
playing
in
the
mueller
report
that
led
to
calls
for
lewandowski
to
be
held
in
contempt
which
nadler
said
he
would
take
under
advisement
in
other
cases
lewandowski
did
answer
within
the
rules
of
engagement
he
said
had
been
set
down
by
the
white
house
counsel's
office
which
he
said
forbade
him
from
talking
about
conversations
with
trump
lewandowski
said
he's
never
read
mueller's
report
took
opportunities
to
mock
or
snap
back
at
democrats
at
one
point
he
addressed
rep
eric
swalwell
d-calif
who
bowed
out
of
a
brief
campaign
earlier
this
year
as
president
swalwell
and
acknowledged
in
at
least
one
case
that
things
might
have
gone
differently
in
rep
lou
correa
d-calif
asked
lewandowski
why
he
or
others
including
a
deputy
sam
clovis
hadn't
talked
with
authorities
about
the
contacts
they
knew
were
being
made
with
campaign
aides
by
russians
in
in
hindsight
it's
something
mr
clovis
probably
should
have
done
lewandowski
said
he
also
used
his
time
in
the
spotlight
on
tuesday
which
included
a
few
break-ins
on
cable
news
to
tease
a
prospective
congressional
campaign
in
new
hampshire
during
a
break
in
the
hearing
lewandowski's
account
on
twitter
posted
a
message
soliciting
help
for
his
potential
senate
run
rep
mary
gay
scanlon
d-pa
cited
the
allusions
as
a
reason
not
to
take
lewandowski's
testimony
seriously
that
says
an
awful
lot
about
the
witness
motivation
to
appear
here
today
and
i've
heard
enough
she
said
what
it's
all
about
for
democrats
the
report
and
its
lingering
importance
have
to
do
with
whether
congress
impeaches
trump
ostensibly
over
the
allegations
that
he
obstructed
justice
in
trying
to
frustrate
the
mueller
investigation
nadler
sought
to
make
clear
before
the
fact
that
congress
is
pursuing
what
he
says
is
impeachment
in
a
meaningful
way
including
in
a
recent
interview
with
npr
member
station
wnyc
the
judiciary
committee's
minority
republicans
meanwhile
scoff
at
democrats
free
repetition
of
impeachment
which
ranking
member
doug
collins
r-ga
and
others
call
a
scam
nadler
is
pretending
there's
an
impeachment
process
underway
collins
says
when
in
fact
the
full
house
hasn't
agreed
to
undertake
one
and
the
democrats
own
leader
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
opposes
it
collins
argues
that
democrats
are
putting
on
a
show
to
placate
their
most
liberal
supporters
and
create
the
illusion
that
impeachment
is
real
it's
a
faux-impeachment
charade
he
said
on
tuesday
they
don't
have
the
votes
collins
said
the
majority
made
a
promise
and
they
couldn't
keep
it
florida
republican
rep
matt
gaetz
called
the
hearing
a
joke
and
complained
about
how
poorly
executed
a
joke
it
has
proved
the
path
the
majority
has
taken
us
on
has
rambled
from
disorganized
to
just
downright
dizzying
he
said
the
republicans
despaired
about
ever
moving
on
from
the
mueller
era
in
the
house
when
the
majority
remains
controlled
by
what
rep
john
ratcliffe
r-texas
described
as
the
party
of
impeachment
they're
going
to
find
something
anything
to
keep
this
impeachment
hoax
alive
he
said
for
lewandowski
and
other
supporters
of
trump
the
mueller
legacy
is
about
a
cabal
of
insiders
who
conspired
to
frame
trump
for
conspiring
with
russia's
interference
and
the
democrats
who
colluded
to
perpetuate
those
charges
mueller's
investigation
established
a
number
of
links
between
trump's
camp
and
the
russians
in
but
not
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
throw
the
election
mueller's
office
also
documented
what
some
outside
it
have
called
obstruction
by
trump
but
the
justice
department
did
not
seek
an
indictment
in
part
because
of
the
privilege
that
trump
enjoys
as
president
protecting
him
from
prosecution
alleged
obstruction
in
the
case
of
lewandowski
the
report
describes
him
playing
a
central
role
in
a
bid
by
trump
to
constrain
the
scope
of
mueller's
inquiry
trump
dictated
a
speech
that
he
wanted
lewandowski
to
give
to
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
one
in
which
sessions
would
have
said
he
wanted
mueller
to
confine
his
investigation
to
preventing
interference
in
future
elections
not
looking
into
what
took
place
in
ultimately
lewandowski
tasked
someone
else
then-deputy
white
house
chief
of
staff
rick
dearborn
with
delivering
that
message
to
sessions
dearborn
balked
and
never
conveyed
it
to
the
justice
department
nadler
and
democrats
wanted
dearborn
and
another
former
white
house
official
rob
porter
to
appear
with
lewandowski
on
tuesday
but
the
trump
administration
barred
them
from
taking
part
the
white
house
said
their
testimony
was
shielded
by
executive
privilege
the
doctrine
that
permits
an
administration
to
shield
some
of
its
workings
from
the
public
lewandowski
also
said
that
was
the
basis
for
his
reticence
even
though
he
never
worked
for
the
trump
administration
lewandowski
said
he
recognized
that
it
wasn't
his
privilege
to
invoke
but
he
argued
that
he
had
a
duty
to
protect
the
president's
ability
to
meet
and
take
counsel
in
confidence
nadler
called
that
yet
another
example
of
what
he
said
was
trump's
attempt
to
obstruct
discovery
of
facts
about
his
administration
this
is
a
shocking
and
dangerous
assertion
of
executive
privilege
and
absolute
immunity
nadler
said
if
he
were
to
prevail
in
this
cover-up
while
the
judiciary
committee
is
considering
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
he
would
upend
the
separation
of
powers
as
envisioned
by
our
founders
