but
the
trend
began
before
he
took
office
the
united
states
has
become
the
world's
leading
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
reshaping
the
global
energy
economy
from
the
shipping
lanes
of
the
middle
east
to
the
factories
of
the
midwest
president
trump
hopes
to
call
attention
to
that
change
on
tuesday
when
he
tours
a
petrochemical
plant
in
western
pennsylvania
cheap
and
abundant
energy
has
fueled
a
resurgence
in
domestic
manufacturing
but
the
growth
in
oil
and
gas
production
began
more
than
a
decade
ago
well
before
trump
took
office
and
u.s.
factory
gains
have
slowed
amid
the
uncertainty
of
the
president's
trade
war
last
year
the
united
states
surpassed
both
russia
and
saudi
arabia
to
become
the
world's
biggest
crude
oil
producer
the
administration
says
its
tax
cuts
and
deregulation
have
contributed
to
the
boom
but
according
to
the
federal
energy
information
administration
oil
production
has
been
rising
steadily
since
and
the
u.s.
became
the
world's
leading
producer
of
natural
gas
that
same
year
this
is
an
administration
which
is
certainly
supportive
of
the
energy
industry
said
kyle
isakower
vice
president
for
regulatory
and
economic
policy
at
the
american
petroleum
institute
they've
taken
efforts
to
try
to
make
regulations
more
common
sense
they've
tried
to
open
up
areas
for
exploration
and
production
the
administration
relaxed
rules
designed
to
limit
methane
pollution
from
oil
and
gas
wells
for
example
and
it's
working
to
implement
the
tax
law
which
allows
oil
drilling
in
parts
of
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
at
the
same
time
the
administration's
steel
tariffs
have
increased
costs
for
energy
pipelines
and
drilling
equipment
to
be
honest
it
has
been
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
isakower
said
some
of
the
administration's
policies
have
had
unintended
consequences
of
being
somewhat
detrimental
to
the
industry
despite
those
challenges
u.s.
crude
oil
production
hit
an
all-time
high
this
summer
of
million
barrels
per
day
thanks
to
a
revolution
in
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
energy
producers
are
now
able
to
extract
oil
and
natural
gas
from
previously
inaccessible
shale
formations
a
development
that's
led
to
steadily
rising
production
for
the
last
decade
natural
gas
production
jumped
between
and
then
rose
another
by
the
petrochemical
plant
trump
is
visiting
tuesday
has
been
on
the
drawing
board
since
more
than
four
years
before
the
president
was
elected
low-priced
energy
has
been
a
boon
for
consumers
but
a
drag
for
producers
according
to
aaa
the
average
price
of
gasoline
nationwide
is
a
gallon
about
cents
a
gallon
less
than
this
time
last
year
and
below
the
all-time
high
in
the
drop
in
natural
gas
prices
has
been
even
more
dramatic
the
price
of
natural
gas
is
at
a
year
low
said
phil
flynn
an
energy
analyst
with
the
price
group
and
that
again
goes
back
to
the
u.s.
energy
producer
and
the
shale
revolution
cheap
natural
gas
has
eclipsed
coal
as
the
leading
fuel
for
electricity
production
low
prices
have
oil
and
gas
drillers
scaling
back
the
number
of
active
drilling
rigs
has
fallen
in
each
of
the
last
six
weeks
and
is
now
below
the
peak
last
november
despite
that
shakeout
production
has
continued
to
grow
the
industry
has
been
tremendously
nimble
isakower
said
as
prices
have
dropped
so
have
the
industry's
break-even
costs
there
are
still
plenty
of
natural
gas
producers
that
are
turning
a
profit
low-cost
energy
has
also
helped
to
fuel
a
revival
in
u.s.
manufacturing
with
factory
jobs
added
during
trump's
first
two
years
in
office
factory
growth
has
slowed
this
year
however
an
index
of
manufacturing
activity
has
fallen
for
the
last
four
months
amid
concern
about
tariffs
and
trade
uncertainty
trade
battles
have
also
limited
energy
exports
china
for
example
would
be
a
natural
market
for
liquefied
natural
gas
from
the
u.s.
but
because
of
ongoing
trade
tensions
beijing
is
instead
shopping
for
energy
supplies
in
australia
and
qatar
there
is
a
real
potential
there
for
even
greater
growth
if
we
can
resolve
some
of
these
trade
conflicts
isakower
said
and
china
is
the
perfect
example
