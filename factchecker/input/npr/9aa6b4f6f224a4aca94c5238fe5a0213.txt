climate

inslee
told
npr
in
march
we
have
to
understand
if
we
don't
solve
the
climate
crisis
it
will
prevent
us
from
dealing
with
all
of
our
other
hopes
and
challenges
but
despite
his
focus
on
the
issue
he
didn't
qualify
for

and
hadn't
qualified
for
the
september
presidential
debate
in
an
message
to
his
supporters
inslee
thanked
them
for
helping
change
the
entire
national
dialogue
on
climate
change
before
i
decided
to
run
trudi
and
i
my
wife
of
nearly
years
decided
in
our
final
days
we
wanted
to
be
able
to
tell
our
three
grandchildren
brody
zoe
and
chase
that
we
had
done
everything
in
our
power
to
defeat
this
crisis
he
wrote
it
is
because
of
you
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
in
this
movement
that
we
can
now
say
that
we
have
enjoyed
one
of
life's
greatest
gifts
to
make
a
difference
on
a
big
issue
