defense
secretary
mark
esper
began
notifying
lawmakers
tuesday
which
projects
will
be
canceled
in
their
districts
top
democrats
immediately
blasted
the
plan
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
was
among
the
first
lawmakers
to
say
his
district
will
be
impacted
by
the
funding
cuts
for
the
u.s.
military
academy
at
west
point
this
decision
will
harm
already
planned
important
projects
intended
to
support
our
service
members
at
military
installations
in
new
york
across
the
united
states
and
around
the
world
schumer
said
it
is
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
who
serve
our
country
that
president
trump
is
willing
to
cannibalize
already
allocated
military
funding
to
boost
his
own
ego
and
for
a
wall
he
promised
mexico
would
pay
to
build
schumer
went
on
to
say
that
trump
is
trying
to
usurp
congress's
exclusive
power
of
the
purse
and
loot
vital
funds
from
our
military
he
also
signaled
congress
will
strongly
oppose
any
funds
for
new
wall
construction
the
washington
post
reported
that
pentagon
officials
said
they
will
halt
military
construction
projects
to
help
build
miles
of
wall
the
plans
come
nearly
seven
months
after
trump
announced
a
national
emergency
to
use
roughly
billion
to
build
a
wall
to
curtail
illegal
immigration
along
the
u.s.
southern
border
of
that
billion
was
slated
to
come
from
the
military
construction
funds
the
trump
administration
said
during
the
feb
announcement
the
funds
are
being
shifted
from
the
pentagon's
fiscal
year
budget
which
was
approved
earlier
this
year
and
runs
through
sept
president
trump's
immigration
efforts
have
failed
since
day
said
sen
jack
reed
d-r
i.
ranking
democrat
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
today
he
made
it
clear
he
is
willing
to
take
funds
from
our
troops
and
disaster
victims
and
divert
them
to
try
to
protect
his
political
right
flank
and
ultimately
that
could
put
americans
at
risk
for
months
democrats
have
pushed
to
get
a
list
of
the
projects
that
would
be
held
in
lieu
of
the
wall
however
the
pentagon
has
remained
tight-lipped
until
this
week
congressional
sources
said
a
full
list
was
slated
to
be
released
wednesday
with
lawmakers
learning
from
the
pentagon
which
additional
projects
are
on
the
chopping
block
reed
said
the
diversion
of
funds
should
be
legally
challenged
and
struck
down
in
the
courts
he
encouraged
broad
bipartisan
opposition
in
congress
and
the
courts
to
misusing
defense
dollars
traditionally
the
pentagon
conducts
a
midyear
review
in
april
to
hunt
down
budget
savings
that
can
be
moved
to
programs
that
need
the
money
now
the
pentagon
is
redirecting
funds
to
the
wall
congress
is
usually
involved
in
approving
the
reallocation
of
military
funds
otherwise
known
as
reprogramming
but
not
this
time
following
demands
from
lawmakers
the
pentagon
had
been
slated
to
release
the
list
of
cut
military
construction
projects
in
may
but
the
plans
were
delayed
