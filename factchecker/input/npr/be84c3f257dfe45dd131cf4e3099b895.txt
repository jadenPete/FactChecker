democrat
dan

the

alleged
fraud
says
tuesday's
election
is
a
chance
for
justice
our
right
to
vote
is
our
most
sacred
right
as
americans
mccready
said
it's
a
right
that
people
have
fought
for
here
at
home
in
the
battle
for
civil
rights
and
that
was
stolen
from
the
people
trump
hammered
mccready
at
monday
night's
rally
for
his
stance
on
immigration
saying
he
supports
sanctuary
cities
though
that's
not
quite
true
more

that
from

here
bishop
a
social
conservative
who
won
the
gop
primary
in

was
known
before
this
race
as
a
co-sponsor
of
hb
north

bathroom
bill
that
mandated
people
in

buildings
use
the

that

last

have

early
on

to
the
rally
trump
told
reporters
he
believes
his
support
will
pay
off
for
bishop
i
think
it's
getting
less
close
trump
said
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
from
two
weeks
ago
and
i
got
involved
about
two
weeks
ago
and
the
numbers
have
gone
way
up
democratic
consultant
bill
busa
says
it's
a
sign

how
energized
democratic
voters
are
oh
i
think
this
is
he
said
we're
here
we're
seeing
what's
going
to
happen
next
year
certainly
around
the
state
and
possibly
around
the
country
when
republican
state
lawmakers
drew
the
th
district
it
was
designed
to
be
an
easy
win
for
the
gop
it
connects
white
wealthy
neighborhoods
in
charlotte
that
have
given
republicans
large
margins
of
victory
for
decades
to
rural
areas
such
as
bladen
county
the
epicenter
of
the
ballot
fraud
scandal
but
in
the
age
of
trump
charlotte
is
changing
ann
mcdade
has
lived
in
the
city
her
whole
life
she's
a
registered
republican
but
she
voted
early
for
mccready
because
of
lgbt
rights
i
just
feel
like
he
represents
my
views
mcdade
said
i
have
a
granddaughter
who
works
at
an
lgbt
theater
in
virginia
and
i
just
think
they
need
more
recognition
and
acceptance
and
i
don't
think
dan
bishop
is
that
way
susan
collis
was
campaigning
for
bishop
this
week
at
an
early
voting
site
in
an
upscale
part
of
charlotte
she
said
newcomers
have
changed
charlotte
she
said
she
sees
license
plates
from
northern
states
all
over
the
city
and
there's
a
whole
lot
of
them
coming
in
from
new
york
new
jersey
all
these
other
states
that
are
super
liberal
she
said
and
i
can't
figure
out
why
most
of
them
that
i
have
talked
to
moved
down
here
it's
because
their
grandkids
but
they
are
bringing
their
politics
with
them
and
they
don't
like
their
politics
back
home
