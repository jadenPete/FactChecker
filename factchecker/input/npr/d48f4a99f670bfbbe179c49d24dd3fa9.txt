about
president
trump's
aborted
plan
to
host
peace
talks
between
afghanistan's
elected
leader
and
representatives
of
the
taliban
but
one
aspect
of
that
ill-starred
rendezvous
is
relatively
easy
to
understand
the
proposed
location
at
camp
david
the
venue
a
federal
facility
in
the
catoctin
mountains
of
maryland
about
miles
northwest
of
washington
d.c.
has
been
associated
in
the
past
with
u.s.
presidents
and
momentous
meetings
the
peace
agreement
known
as
the
camp
david
accords
was
negotiated
there
by
president
jimmy
carter
and
the
presidents
of
israel
and
egypt
in
september
of
and
signed
six
months
later
at
the
white
house
even
today
speaking
of
those
accords
or
mentioning
a
camp
david-style
negotiation
has
the
power
to
summon
hope
the
place
and
the
phrase
have
become
an
emblem
of
serious
commitment
to
diplomacy
cooperation
and
peace
and
they
carry
the
cachet
of
success
that's
why
trump
said
he
made
the
decision
on
his
own
reportedly
over
the
objections
of
his
advisers
to
try
again
at
camp
david
for
an
accord
with
and
between
afghanistan's
government
and
the
insurgent
taliban
the
situation
in
afghanistan
however
is
quite
different
from
that
in
the
middle
east
in
the
late
s
and
donald
trump
is
a

presidents
since
have
used

david
in
various
ways
but
carter
gambled
the
most
on
making
the
isolation
and
intense
focus
of
the

atmosphere
pay
off
the
political
future
of
three
national
leaders
carter
egyptian

and

prime

menachem
begin
hung
in
the
balance
at
their
summit
all
emerged
as
winners
begin
and
sadat
shared
the
nobel
peace
prize
and
carter
enjoyed
what
may
have
been
the
best
few
weeks
of
his
presidency
perhaps
as
important
each
laid
claim
to
the
title
of
peacemaker
as
a
part
of
his
legacy
in
office
the
glory
of
course
would
be
fleeting
carter
was
beaten
badly
in
his
bid
for
reelection
in
sadat
was
assassinated
by
hard-liners
in
the
egyptian
army
the
following
year
and
begin
resigned
as
prime
minister
in
after
attempts
to
defeat
the
palestine
liberation
organization
in
lebanon
resulted
in
heavy
casualties
among
civilians
but
there
was
general
agreement
that
the
isolation
and
allure
of
camp
david
contributed
mightily
to
the
success
of
the
negotiations
and
there
was
far
more
at
work
than
environment
alone
for
starters
the
ordeal
lasted
days
without
a
break
with
the
participants
meeting
and
then
retiring
to
their
respective
cabins
for
consultations
and
strategizing
carter's
patience
in
pursuit
of
a
project
was
legendary
and
he
made
it
a
personal
challenge
to
keep
both
sadat
and
begin
in
camp
and
talking
this
entailed
endless
rewrites
and
tinkerings
and
tested
the
engineer
in
carter
who
always
believed
a
solution
could
be
found
we'll
see
what
happens
so
gaudy
was
the
media
splash
back
in
that
it
could
not
have
escaped
the
young
donald
trump
then
a
businessman
in
his
early
s
nor
would
the
current
president
fail
to
have
noted
the
camp
david
connection
to
the
nobel
peace
prize
an
honor
of
which
he
has
spoken
numerous
times
even
though
the
negotiations
toward
ending
the
year
afghan
war
have
taken
place
in
various
locales
far
from
the
u.s.
over
the
past
months
president
trump
apparently
took
an
interest
in
having
the
climactic
moments
of
final
deal-making
take
place
on
his
turf
albeit
a
turf
he
visits
far
less
often
than
his
own
properties
moving
the
endgame
negotiations
to
camp
david
seems
to
have
been
acceptable
to
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
although
it
has
not
been
clear
the
idea
was
accepted
by
the
taliban
but
as
the
actual
weekend
for
the
meeting
approached
the
president
seemed
to
shift
course
he
sent
a
tweet
saturday
night
disclosing
the
previously
secret
meeting
and
saying
he
had
called
it
off
asked
about
this
monday
trump
said
he
had
taken
my
own
advice
about
it
the
president
also
said
talks
with
the
taliban
are
dead
we
may
never
know
how
close
trump
actually
came
to
bringing
the
belligerents
to
camp
david
or
anywhere
else
for
a
carter-like
tour
de
force
of
diplomacy
and
deal-making
certainly
the
challenge
of
an
afghan
peace
deal
is
thorny
and
fraught
with
political
costs
reminiscent
of
the
challenges
carter
faced
still
trump
has
scarcely
been
regarded
as
a
carter
admirer
in
the
past
and
his
approach
to
issues
and
personal
style
offer
stark
contrast
moreover
the
afghanistan
negotiations
involve
a
party
the
taliban
with
which
the
united
states
is
in
direct
hostilities
american
forces
have
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
taliban
fighters
over
nearly
years
and
the
taliban
are
responsible
for
thousands
of
american
deaths
where
carter
sought
to
be
an
outside
broker
trump
as
commander
in
chief
must
both
be
a
broker
among
the
afghan
parties
and
his
own
enemy
the
political
and
diplomatic
difficulty
of
that
reality
was
underscored
by
the
reason
trump
gave
for
calling
off
the
camp
david

it
is
not

how
close
the
various
parties
in
afghanistan
were
to
a
peace

although
taliban
spokesmen
have
referred

for
five
years
urging
all

give
up

on

it
he
has
continued
to
offer
various
olive
branches
to
the
taliban
who
have
never
accepted
his
legitimacy
and
fiercely
oppose
the
u.s.
backed
military
coalition
although

is
duly

control

inability
of
american

to
confine

force
them

based
on
that
threat
has
caused
the
war
to
grind
on
over
fighting
season
after
fighting
season
at
the
same
time
many
within
the
u.s.
national
security
apparatus
see
the
withdrawal
of
u.s.
forces
as
tantamount
to
turning
afghanistan
over
to
the
taliban
intelligence
assessments
are
bleak
about
the
prospects
for
an
afghanistan
without
a
stabilizing
american
military
presence
at
the
same
time
the
notion
of
any
respectful
negotiating
with
the
taliban
has
always
been
offensive
to
some
in
the
u.s.
national
security
community
the
timing
of
this
meeting
also
was
especially
problematic
just
three
days
before
the
anniversary
of
the
terror
attacks
of
sept
that
killed
nearly
people
in
new
york
virginia
and
pennsylvania
the
taliban
praised
those
attacks
at
the
time
and
provided
a
safe
haven
in
afghanistan
for
al-qaida
the
organization
that
launched
them
the
taliban
have
defended
the
sept
attacks
as
recently
as
this
summer
rep
liz
cheney
a
republican
from
wyoming
has
noted
that
officials
of
the
george
w.
bush
administration
met
at
camp
david
to
plan
a
response
to
the
terror
attacks
of
sept
and
said
no
member
of
the
taliban
should
ever
set
foot
there
ever
at
this
point
that
prospect
still
seems
as
unlikely
as
ever
