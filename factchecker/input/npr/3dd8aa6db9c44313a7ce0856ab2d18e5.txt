customs
and
border
protection
intercepted
and
seized
illegal
firearms
parts
from
china
in
recent
months
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
said
it
recently
made
an
unusual
seizure
at
a
port
in
california
agents
in
long
beach
intercepted
three
shipments
containing
nearly
sights
stocks
and
other
gun
parts
that
came
illegally
from
china
there
was
no
attempt
to
hide
the
importation
jaime
ruiz
told
npr
on
friday
he
said
the
gun
parts
were
correctly
labeled
and
still
had
their
original
trademarks
and
all
three
shipments
were
headed
to
a
legitimate
seller
and
distributor
it's
kind
of
an
unusual
situation
ruiz
said
cpb
stopped
the
shipments
over
the
past
three
months
and
consulted
with
investigators
at
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
the
agency
concluded
that
the
cargo
breached
multiple
regulations
including
an
arms
embargo
that
the
united
states
imposed
on
china
the
seizure
comes
at
a
time
when
confiscations
of
gun
parts
munitions
explosives
and
fireworks
have
increased
over
last
year
across
the
united
states
ports
of
entry
ruiz
told
npr
but
usually
smugglers
attempt
to
illegally
export
weapons
and
ammunition
made
in
the
united
states
we
can't
characterize
this
as
a
new
trend
but
something
really
unusual
as
china
historically
is
the
main
source
of
other
items
like
wearing
apparel
footwear
watches
jewelry
handbags
wallets
and
electronics
ruiz
said
the
cpb
has
noted
a
different
trend
feeding
a
black
market
the
flow
of
counterfeit
computer
networking
equipment
from
china
a
homeland
security
report
found
that
last
year
cpb
and
homeland
security
investigations
seized
shipments
containing
routers
and
other
equipment
sporting
fake
trademarks
a
increase
in
seizures
from
last
year's
seizures
were
valued
at
nearly
million
phony
routers
could
possibly
be
linked
to
the
chinese
government
says
will
carter
deputy
director
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
technology
policy
program
but
the
bigger
concern
is
that
the
routers
are
not
properly
maintained
by
a
supplier
to
patch
vulnerabilities
they
can
be
built
with
poor-quality
components
he
told
npr
in
a
publicized
federal
case
from
the
fbi
identified
some
counterfeit
network
components
from
china
through
an
effort
called
operation
cisco
raider
crimes
like
these
threaten
international
commerce
national
security
and
the
very
safety
of
our
citizens
a
homeland
security
assistant
secretary
said
at
the
time
cpb
said
the
recently
confiscated
shipments
of
gun
parts
were
worth
about
the
seizure
led
some
to
wonder
whether
the
items
were
a
test
to
see
how
closely
the
u.s.
government
was
monitoring
shipments
or
a
business
was
just
trying
to
cut
corners
by
buying
cheaper
parts
