president

have

investigation
updated
on
sept
at
p
m
et
in
a
july
conversation
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
president
trump
asked
for
an
investigation
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden
for
their
activities
in
ukraine
several
years
ago
in
a
memorandum
of
that
call
released
wednesday
trump
said
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
that
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
the
call
is
reportedly
connected
to
a
whistleblower
complaint
which
has
ignited
the
controversy
trump
democrats
say
pressured
a
foreign
government
to
dig
up
dirt
on
biden
now
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
but
trump
says
that
he
did
nothing
wrong
and
that
the
inquiry
is
just
a
witch
hunt
in
fact
justice
department
officials
said
wednesday
that
prosecutors
determined
there
was
no
campaign
finance
violation
trump
has
instead
pointed
to
corruption
by
joe
biden
and
his
son
the
biden
camp
has
argued
that
claims
of
wrongdoing
on
the
bidens
part
are
unfounded
and
have
been
debunked
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
biden
told
reporters
recently
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
here
are
five
questions
about
the
accusations
and
the
facts
behind
them
so
what
did
joe
biden
do
in
ukraine
ukraine
had
a
revolution
in
february
when
the
pro-russian
president
viktor
yanukovych
was
ousted
and
fled
to
russia
amid
massive
sustained
protests
that
focused
on
corruption
in
his
administration
a
pro-western
president
petro
poroshenko
took
over
then-president
barack
obama's
administration
was
prepared
to
work
with
the
new
government
a
position
shared
with
european
governments
and
international
institutions
such
as
the
world
bank
and
the
international
monetary
fund
but
they
were
all
concerned
about
the
country's
endemic
corruption
which
had
plagued
the
country
ever
since
it
gained
independence
in
the
breakup
of
the
soviet
union
obama
made
then-vice
president
biden
the
point
man
and
he
became
a
frequent
visitor
to
ukraine
by
his
own
count
biden
says
he
went
there
about
a
dozen
times
from
early
through
early
what
role
did
joe
biden's
son
hunter
biden
play
in
ukraine
in
the
spring
of
as
joe
biden
began
his
trips
to
ukraine
hunter
biden
took
a
position
on
the
board
of
the
country's
largest
private
gas
company
burisma
he
was
reportedly
paid
up
to
a
month
the
question
of
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
with
hunter
biden
profiting
in
a
country
where
his
father
was
actively
working
with
the
government
was
raised
publicly
at
the
time
joe
biden
said
that
he
followed
government
ethics
regulations
and
that
his
son
was
a
private
citizen
who
made
his
own
decisions
also
the
obama
administration
actually
supported
investigations
into
corruption
this
included
looking
into
the
gas
company
because
the
owner
mykola
zlochevsky
was
close
to
the
ousted
president
and
they
had
both
fled
the
country
before
the
bidens
became
regular
visitors
is
there
any
sign
of
wrongdoing
by
either
joe
biden
or
his
son
hunter
biden
this
is
what
trump
and
his
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
are
suggesting
but
they
have
not
provided
evidence
of
illegal
actions
multiple
fact
checks
have
called
trump's
accusations
of
corruption
by
the
bidens
misleading
joe
biden
has
actually
boasted
about
his
work
in
ukraine
as
a
spokesperson
for
the
white
house
and
the
west
generally
he
called
for
the
ouster
of
the
top
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
for
what
was
widely
seen
as
his
failure
to
investigate
corruption
in
march
biden
made
one
of
his
many
trips
to
ukraine
and
told
the
country's
leaders
that
they
had
to
get
rid
of
the
prosecutor
if
they
wanted
billion
in
u.s.
aid
biden
told
the
story
last
year
at
the
council
on
foreign
relations
i
said
you're
not
getting
the
billion
i'm
leaving
in
six
hours
if
the
prosecutor
is
not
fired
you're
not
getting
the
money
well
son
of
a
b
he
got
fired
biden
said
how
do
trump
and
his
supporters
see
joe
biden's
work
they
argue
that
joe
biden
wanted
the
prosecutor
ousted
to
protect
his
son
from
being
investigated
but
there
has
been
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
and
joe
biden
was
tasked
as
vice
president
with
helping
to
weed
out
corruption
in
ukraine
the
key
figure
in
pushing
the
corruption
narrative
appears
to
be
giuliani
he
has
been
in
contact
with
ukraine
multiple
times
and
urged
officials
there
to
look
into
the
bidens
the
story
has
been
percolating
for
the
past
few
months
giuliani
has
repeatedly
tweeted
about
it
and
discussed
it
on
tv
meanwhile
hunter
biden
stepped
down
from
his
post
at
the
gas
company
this
past
spring
as
his
term
expired
saying
he
turned
down
an
offer
to
have
it
extended
he
recognized
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
issue
in
the
campaign
my
qualifications
and
work
are
being
attacked
by
rudy
giuliani
and
his
minions
for
transparent
political
purposes
hunter
biden
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
what's
next
democrats
say
they
now
want
to
see
the
complaint
by
the
whistleblower
which
has
still
not
reached
congress
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
michael
atkinson
reported
the
whistleblower
complaint
about
the
call
to
the
house
intelligence
committee
in
a
sept
letter
but
when
atkinson
was
called
before
a
closed-door
committee
hearing
last
thursday
he
reportedly
told
members
that
he
was
being
blocked
from
releasing
the
details
of
the
complaint
by
joseph
maguire
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
maguire
has
been
called
for
the
same
committee
this
thursday
in
a
public
hearing
meanwhile
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
who
had
resisted
calls
from
congressional
democrats
on
the
impeachment
question
announced
tuesday
that
she
was
initiating
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
against
the
