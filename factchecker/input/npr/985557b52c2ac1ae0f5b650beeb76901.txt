alabama
republican
gov

ivey
has
apologized
for
wearing
blackface
during
a
skit
at
auburn
university
more
than
years
ago
ivey
said
thursday
she
still
doesn't
recall
the
incident
but
after
a
recording
surfaced
of
her
discussing
the
sketch
with
her
then-fianc
and
later
first
husband
ben
laravia
ivey
admitted
it
must
be
true
even
after
listening
to
the
tape
i
sincerely
do
not
recall
either
the
skit
which
evidently
occurred
at
a
baptist
student
union
party
or
the
interview
itself
both
which
occurred
years
ago
even
though
ben
is
the
one
on
tape
remembering
the
skit
and
i
still
don't
recall
ever
dressing
up
in
overalls
or
in
blackface
i
will
not
deny
what
is
the
obvious
ivey
said
as
such
i
fully
acknowledge
with
genuine
remorse
my
participation
in
a
skit
like
that
back
when
i
was
a
senior
in
college
according
to
the
interview
ivey
and
laravia
did
with
the
campus
radio
station
in
the
sketch
was
titled
cigar
butts
and
did
not
require
a
lot
of
talent
as
far
as
verbal
talent
but
did
require
a
lot
of
physical
acting
such
as
crawling
around
on
the
floor
looking
for
cigar
butts
and
things
like
this
which
certainly
got
a
big
reaction
out
of
the
audience
ivey
is
the
latest
politician
to
be
swept
into
scandal
over
the
wearing
of
blackface
a
racist
practice
that
has
its
roots
in
minstrel
shows
earlier
this
year
virginia
democratic
gov
ralph
northam
admitted
he
had
put
black
shoe
polish
on
his
face
to
dress
up
like
michael
jackson
for
a
dance
contest
an
admission
that
came
after
a
photo
of
a
man
dressed
up
in
blackface
aside
another
man
in
ku
klux
klan
dress
appeared
on
northam's
medical
school
yearbook
page
northam
has
denied
either
man
is
him
soon
after
virginia
democratic
attorney
general
mark
herring
admitted
he
had
put
on
blackface
when
dressing
up
like
a
rapper
during
college
other
politicians
have
come
under
fire
for
appearing
in
confederate
uniforms
in
a
state
like
alabama
infamous
for
its
violence
against
and
treatment
of
african
americans
during
the
civil
rights
movement
ivey's
admission
could
draw
even
more
scrutiny
ivey
alluded
to
those
tensions
in
her
apology
saying
it's
not
what
my
administration
represents
all
these
years
later
i
offer
my
heartfelt
apologies
for
the
pain
and
embarrassment
this
causes
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
going
forward
to
help
show
the
nation
that
the
alabama
of
today
is
a
far
cry
from
the
alabama
of
the
s
ivey
said
we
have
come
a
long
way
for
sure
but
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
february
the
auburn
student
newspaper
uncovered
yearbook
photos
of
members
of
ivey's
sorority
appearing
in
blackface
but
the
governor
denied
she
ever
participated
rep
terri
sewell
the
state's
only
democratic
house
member
tweeted
that
gov
ivey's
admission
today
only
deepens
open
wounds
and
her
words
of
apology
ring
hollow
if
not
met
with
real
action
to
bridge
the
racial
divide
but
the
state
republican
party
has
come
to
ivey's
defense
the
alabama
republican
party
appreciates
and
supports
gov
kay
ivey
taking
ownership
of
and
responsibility
for
this
plus-year-old
incident
while
it
occurred
when
she
was
a
college
student
governor
ivey
has
stood
up
admitted
her
mistake
and
offered
a
sincere
apology
though
she
has
no
recollection
of
the
event
alabama
gop
chairman
terry
lathan
said
in
a
statement
her
extraordinary
record
of
public
service
shows
her
ability
to
work
with
all
people
regardless
of
race
religion
or
party
affiliation
