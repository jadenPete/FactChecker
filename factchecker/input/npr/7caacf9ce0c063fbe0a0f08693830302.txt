once
again
health
care
took
up
a
large
chunk
of
a
democratic
primary
debate
once
again
there
were
fights
over
costs
coverage
and
whether
the
party
is
growing
too
extreme
but
this
time
all
of
the
front-runners
were
onstage
together
providing
the
first
opportunity
for
all
of
them
to
take
direct
aim
at
each
other
and
their
vastly
differing
health
care
plans
it
made
for
some
heated
exchanges
putting
medicare
for
all
supporters
on
defense
but
it
also
showed
clearly
that
some
candidates
are
cautious
not
to
criticize
others
proposals
too
harshly
thursday
night's
debate
featured
two
stalwart
supporters
of
the
single-payer
medicare
for
all
health
care
plan
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
who
introduced
the
bill
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
one
of
the
bill's
co-sponsors
and
from
the
start
former
vice
president
joe
biden
came
out
swinging
at
them
how
are
we
going
to
pay
for
it
i
want
to
hear
tonight
how
that's
happening
he
said
making
the
case
that
his
public
option
proposal
would
cost
less
one
of
the
main
arguments
against
medicare
for
all
is
that
it
would
mean
much
higher
government
spending
supporters
counter
that
it
would
lead
to
overall
less
health
care
spending
than
the
current
system
studies
have
been
mixed
on
this
question
of
whether
costs
would
be
higher
or
lower
what
would
change
they
argue
is
that
the
spending
would
be
done
by
the
government
with
taxpayer
dollars
rather
than
via
copays
and
premiums
for
example
warren
drove
at
this
point
when
moderator
george
stephanopoulos
asked
about
the
potential
for
higher
taxes
for
everyday
americans
in
her
answer
she
did
not
give
a
flat
yes
or
no
and
avoided
giving
an
endlessly
sound-bite-able
answer
about
the
potential
for
higher
taxes
for
everyday
americans
instead
of
paying
premiums
into
insurance
companies
and
then
having
insurance
companies
build
their
profits
by
saying
no
to
coverage
we
are
going
to
do
this
by
saying
everyone
is
covered
by
medicare
for
all
every
health
care
provider
is
covered
she
said
and
the
only
question
here
in
terms
of
difference
is
where
to
send
the
bill
there
are
also
many
democrats
such
as
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
who
stress
that
medicare
for
all
would
virtually
eliminate
private
insurance
while
bernie
wrote
the
bill
i
read
the
bill
she
said
and
on
page
of
the
bill
it
says
that
we
will
no
longer
have
private
insurance
as
we
know
it
and
that
means
that
million
americans
will
no
longer
be
able
to
have
their
current
insurance
in
four
years
polling
has
shown
that
many
americans
don't
understand
that
private
insurance
would
largely
disappear
under
medicare
for
all
polling
has
also
shown
that
the
idea
of
eliminating
private
insurance
makes
the
plan
much
less
popular
altogether
eight
candidates
on
thursday's
stage
support
either
a
public
option
or
some
other
sort
of
overhaul
that
would
still
maintain
a
substantial
role
for
private
insurance
polling
shows
that
a
public
option
is
far
more
popular
than
single-payer
health
care
a
july
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
found
that
of
democrats
as
well
as
of
all
adults
support
a
public
option
meanwhile
of
democrats
and
of
all
adults
support
medicare
for
all
that's
less
support
but
still
a
majority
of
democrats
support
sanders
single-payer
plan
some
of
them
passionately
perhaps
with
that
in
mind
even
candidates
who
support
other
plans
refrained
from
attacking
the
proposal
or
its
author
too
hard
for
example
while
klobuchar
slammed
medicare
for
all
she
made
sure
to
praise
sanders
himself
for
working
with
her
on
trying
to
bring
down
prescription
drug
prices
california
sen
kamala
harris
who
co-sponsored
sanders
bill
sold
her
plan
as
a
medicare
for
all
plan
though
it
is
substantially
different
from
what
sanders
has
proposed
it
would
for
example
retain
a
significant
role
for
private
insurance
she
also
took
care
to
praise
sanders
even
while
she
supports
a
different
plan
i
want
to
give
credit
to
bernie
she
said
take
credit
bernie
you
know
you
brought
us
this
far
in
medicare
for
all
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
who
also
co-sponsored
sanders
plan
said
thursday
i
believe
in
medicare
for
all
but
he
also
proposed
a
more
incremental
approach
indeed
in
past
debates
when
asked
he
did
not
indicate
that
he
would
be
willing
to
get
rid
of
private
insurance
which
sanders
bill
would
largely
do
in
responding
to
biden's
attacks
warren
made
sure
to
praise
former
president
barack
obama
saying
we
all
owe
huge
debt
to
president
obama
for
the
affordable
care
act
likewise
biden
hugged
obama
tightly
in
promoting
his
own
plan
saying
that
it
would
build
on
obamacare
obamacare
is
popular
among
democrats
have
a
favorable
view
of
it
and
it
has
grown
in
popularity
among
all
americans
since
donald
trump's
election
however
all
democrats
in
this
field
agree
that
it
needs
an
overhaul
the
balancing
act
that
many
are
trying
to
do
is
pushing
their
own
plans
without
slamming
others
too
hard
