p
m
et
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
is
lashing
out
at
the
media
coverage
of
his
presidential
campaign
in
a
way
that
might
sound
familiar
i
talk
about
that
all
of
the
time
sanders
said
of
amazon
paying
nothing
in
taxes
and
then
i
wonder
why
the
washington
post
which
is
owned
by
jeff
bezos
who
owns
amazon
doesn't
write
particularly
good
articles
about
me
i
don't
know
why
he
said
at
a
campaign
event
in
new
hampshire
on
tuesday
bezos
is
the
founder
and
ceo
of
amazon
and
privately
purchased
the
post
the
remark
sounded
an
awful
lot
like
the
kind
of
criticism
leveled
by
someone
else
t
he
failing
new
york
times
and
the
amazon
washington
post
do
nothing
but
write
bad
stories
even
on
very
positive
achievements
and
they
will
never
change
president
trump
tweeted
last
year
trump
has
tweeted
or
retweeted
criticism
of
the
paper
tying
it
to
amazon
more
than
times
since
his
campaign
for
president
candidates
voice
criticism
of
the
media
all
the
time
in
an
attempt
to
curry
better
coverage
every
campaign
pushes
back
against
stories
it
thinks
were
done
unfairly
including
democratic
presidential
candidates
in
this
field
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
campaign
does
not
like
what
it
sees
as
the
media's
focus
on
his
gaffes
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang's
loyal
followers
don't
believe
he
gets
enough
coverage
but
none
are
echoing
the
president's
language
or
accusing
news
outlets
owners
of
influencing
coverage
in
quite
the
same
way
the
post's
editor
marty
baron
noted
that
bezos
does
not
influence
the
newspaper's
coverage
and
accused
sanders
of
peddling
a
conspiracy
theory
sen
sanders
is
a
member
of
a
large
club
of
politicians
of
every
ideology
who
complain
about
their
coverage
baron
said
contrary
to
the
conspiracy
theory
the
senator
seems
to
favor
jeff
bezos
allows
our
newsroom
to
operate
with
full
independence
as
our
reporters
and
editors
can
attest
sanders
pivoted
tuesday
afternoon
saying
that
his
criticism
was
more
of
a
general
one
of
corporate-owned
media
and
that
he
doesn't
believe
bezos
was
on
the
phone
directing
coverage
so
this
is
not
into
conspiracy
theory
sanders
told
cnn
we
are
taking
on
corporate
america
large
corporations
own
the
media
in
america
by
and
large
and
i
think
there
is
a
framework
about
how
the
corporate
media
focuses
on
politics
that
is
my
concern
it's
not
that
jeff
bezos
is
on
the
phone
every
day
he's
not
sanders
went
on
to
criticize
trump
for
lambasting
the
media
and
calling
them
the
enemy
of
the
people
he
called
that
a
disgusting
remark
which
undermines
american
democracy
sanders
added
there
are
some
really
great
articles
out
there
like
investigations
which
we
use
so
i
don't
think
media
is
fake
news
the
post
reported
last
month
on
a
labor
fight
within
the
sanders
campaign
it
noted
that
workers
wanted
annual
salaries
at
least
equivalent
to
a
an
hour
minimum
wage
coverage
of
health
care
costs
for
those
making
a
year
or
less
and
reimbursement
for
travel
and
use
of
their
own
vehicles
at
a
mile
sanders
has
argued
that
amazon
the
online
shopping
behemoth
should
pay
more
in
taxes
and
pay
its
workers
more
several
communities
for
example
had
offered
tax
abatements
in
exchange
for
amazon
setting
up
its
second
headquarters
to
their
cities
and
it's
unclear
whether
amazon
paid
anything
in
taxes
at
all
last
year
the
wall
street
journal
reported
amazon
moved
part
of
what
would
have
been
its
second
headquarters
out
of
new
york
recently
because
of
protests
against
the
deal
the
city
gave
it
sanders
has
been
critical
of
corporations
including
amazon
that
do
not
or
did
not
have
a
minimum
wage
the
level
he
wants
to
be
a
federal
minimum
facing
pressure
including
from
sanders
amazon
raised
its
minimum
wage
to
in
october
of
last
year
sanders
has
also
introduced
the
stop
bezos
act
bad
employers
by
zeroing
out
subsidies
which
would
according
to
sanders
senate
office
there
appeared
to
be
a
detente
between
sanders
and
bezos
with
the
move
to
raise
amazon's
minimum
wage
in
october
sanders
praised
the
move
calling
it
enormously
important
bezos
replied
on
twitter
saying
he
was
excited
about
this
and
that
he
hoped
others
will
join
in
while
sanders
has
again
shown
fundraising
strength
during
his
presidential
bid
he
has
struggled
to
gain
the
kind
of
traction
he
had
in
the
presidential
election
he
is
competing
with
a
much
broader
field
of
progressive
candidates
including
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
who
has
now
passed
him
in
an
average
of
national
polls
she
is
ahead
of
him
in
the
key
early
states
of
iowa
and
polling
close
to
him
in
new
hampshire
where
sanders
won
handily
in
the
primary
note
amazon
is
one
of
npr's
sponsors
