candidates
are
introduced
before
the
second
of
two
democratic
presidential
primary
debates
hosted
by
cnn
last
month
in
detroit
the
massive
democratic
presidential
field
could
begin
its
inevitable
reduction
this
week
with
only
half
of
the
current
candidates
set
to
make
the
cut
for
next
month's
debate
the
controversial
decision
will
please
many
party
stalwarts
who
worry
that
the
often
dizzying
number
of
democrats
seeking
the
nomination
could
endanger
their
chances
of
defeating
president
trump
but
other
candidates
who
have
struggled
to
gain
traction
and
meet
the
debate
qualifications
set
forth
by
the
democratic
national
committee
are
already
complaining
that
party
leaders
are
trying
to
manipulate
the
process
and
voters
won't
even
start
to
weigh
in
for
more
than
five
months
the
election
has
presented
the
dnc
with
a
new
set
of
challenges
as
it
tries
to
maneuver
the
largest
field
in
modern
presidential
history
here's
how
the
party
got
here
the
historical
precedents
that
led
up
to
this
cycle
and
why
ultimately
the
party
does
end
up
playing
an
outsized
role
in
the
nominating
process
has
the
party
always
stepped
in
during
primaries
there
is
a
widespread
misconception
that
the
right
to
vote
covers
voting
in
primaries
it
does
not
said
elaine
kamarck
of
the
brookings
institution
kamarck
who
is
author
of
primary
politics
everything
you
need
to
know
about
how
america
nominates
its
presidential
candidates
says
federal
courts
have
upheld
that
either
political
party
has
the
right
to
set
the
rules
how
it
wants
to
as
long
as
civil
rights
aren't
violated
primaries
are
not
covered
she
says
because
they
are
the
process
whereby
a
private
or
semi-public
organization
called
the
political
party
nominates
people
to
be
its
standard-bearer
in
fact
parties
have
quite
a
stake
in
who
their
standard-bearer
is
because
the
value
of
a
party
is
its
brand
that's
why
parties
are
constantly
evolving
and
reacting
to
the
latest
elections
as
they
try
to
nominate
the
strongest
candidate
in
fact
the
modern
primary
system
as
we
know
it
now
has
only
been
in
place
for
about
the
past
years
as
a
reaction
to
the
election
that
race
saw
democrats
nominate
hubert
humphrey
who
hadn't
run
in
any
primaries
over
the
anti-war
eugene
mccarthy
humphrey
went
on
to
lose
to
republican
richard
nixon
so
the
party
moved
away
from
letting
delegates
and
party
insiders
pick
their
nominee
but
four
years
later
after
democrat
george
mcgovern
lost
in
a
landslide
to
nixon
there
was
a
push
for
more
party
influence
in
choosing
a
nominee
thus
superdelegates
delegates
who
are
free
to
support
any
candidate
were
created
to
supplement
delegates
accrued
via
primaries
and
caucuses
eventually
democrats
replaced
a
winner-take-all
system
for
individual
state
contests
like
the
one
used
by
the
gop
with
a
proportional
allocation
system
provided
a
candidate
gets
of
the
vote
still
there
has
been
a
constant
push
and
pull
between
how
much
influence
primaries
versus
party
leaders
should
have
after
the
role
of
superdelegates
was
drastically
reduced
amid
pressure
from
bernie
sanders
allies
how
have
debates
been
handled
by
parties
in
the
past
the
question
of
who
makes
it
on
stage
hasn't
been
much
of
a
problem
for
democrats
until
this
year
although
republicans
began
to
grapple
with
it
last
election
with
the
sheer
number
of
candidates
continuing
to
grow
each
cycle
it's
a
phenomenon
that
may
not
be
waning
in
and
for
example
all
the
democratic
candidates
were
able
to
fit
on
one
stage
with
fewer
than
major
hopefuls
running
each
time
but
in
republicans
saw
about
major
candidates
seek
their
party's
nomination
so
the
republican
national
committee
decided
to
split
the
major
candidates
into
slots
for
two
debates
what
became
known
as
the
main
stage
debate
for
the
higher-polling
candidates
and
the
undercard
debate
for
lower-polling
hopefuls
unlike
the
republicans
in
democrats
this
year
are
allowing
all
candidates
to
debate
in
prime
time
the
rnc
came
under
fire
for
relying
on
polling
alone
to
shape
their
candidate
field
so
this
year
with
democrats
facing
an
even
larger
field
that
hit
hopefuls
at
its
highest
the
dnc
came
up
with
a
two-pronged
system
that
used
not
just
polling
but
also
fundraising
measures
to
determine
which
candidates
would
qualify
for
the
first
two
debates
in
june
and
july
the
rules
were
more
lenient
a
candidate
only
had
to
reach
in
at
least
four
sanctioned
national
or
early
state
polls
in
addition
to
reaching
donors
from
different
states
but
for
the
september
and
october
debates
those
benchmarks
doubled
to
in
four
polls
and
donors
so
the
candidates
who
made
the
first
debates
has
been
cut
in
half
ten
candidates
qualify
so
far
with
just
one
day
left
for
others
on
the
verge
to
do
so
not
making
the
debate
stage
doesn't
disqualify
a
candidate
though
and
some
who
don't
meet
september's
stringent
criteria
could
still
make
it
in
for
october
are
the
debate
rules
really
that
limiting
for
candidates
no
according
to
the
dnc
chairman
tom
perez
back
in
june
he
defended
the
committee's
rules
saying
that
there
was
an
expectation
that
candidates
had
to
show
they
were
gaining
support
and
not
just
staying
stagnant
especially
in
such
a
large
field
we've
said
this
all
along
that
in
the
fall
we're
going
to
raise
the
threshold
because
that's
what
we
always
do
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
you're
making
progress
and
is
hardly
a
high
bar
in
my
judgment
perez
said
on
cnn
in
june
you
can't
win
the
presidency
in
the
modern
era
if
you
can't
build
relationships
with
the
grass
roots
others
who
have
struggled
to
qualify
say
the
requirements
benefit
wealthy
candidates
who
can
spend
more
earlier
this
month
montana
gov
steve
bullock
blasted
the
rules
that
could
now
let
billionaire
environmentalist
tom
steyer
who
just
entered
the
race
last
month
make
the
cut
but
would
keep
out
bullock
who
has
argued
his
electability
based
on
winning
in
a
trump
state
but
has
struggled
to
catch
on
nonetheless
kamarck's
suggestion
for
democrats
to
help
the
process
could
boost
someone
like
bullock
she
says
that
while
the
party
has
recoiled
from
the
appearance
of
trying
to
determine
who
might
be
strong
or
weak
candidates
instead
leaving
it
up
to
more
tangible
measures
like
polls
and
fundraising
it
should
reconsider
that
stance
the
fact
that
this
debate
is
likely
to
leave
out
every
single
governor
running
in
addition
to
other
elected
officials
who
in
any
other
cycle
could
be
strong
contenders
is
evidence
of
the
hesitation
to
let
party
leaders
weigh
in
at
all
even
if
it
could
be
needed
instead
as
many
as
three
candidates
who
have
never
held
any
type
of
federal
or
statewide
office
before
could
be
onstage
of
course
republican
party
leaders
were
unhappy
when
a
political
newcomer
swamped
their
primary
field
in
and
then
he
won
the
white
house
what
we've
lost
in
this
nomination
system
which
we
had
in
the
old
system
was
peer
review
people
who
know
the
individuals
and
know
what
is
required
don't
have
any
say
anymore
in
the
process
argued
kamarck
it's
been
an
overreaction
