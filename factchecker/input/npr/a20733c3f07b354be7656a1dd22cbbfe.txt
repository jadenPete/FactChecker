the
captain
of
a
controversial
ship
that
saved
migrants
in
the
mediterranean
sea
has
refused
to
accept
a
medal
for
her
work
pia
klemp
who
is
german
gained
attention
for
rescuing
thousands
of
stranded
migrants
with
her
crew
as
part
of
the
nongovernmental
organization
sea
watch
international
for
her
efforts
she
reportedly
faces
up
to
years
in
prison
in
italy
where
the
hard-line
anti-immigrant
government
accused
her
of
assisting
illegal
immigration
in
a
facebook
message
published
tuesday
night
klemp
announced
that
she
was
rejecting
the
grand
vermeil
medal
which
the
city
of
paris
awards
for
bravery
she
told
mayor
anne
hidalgo
that
the
city
was
brimming
with
hypocrisy
your
police
steal
blankets
from
people
that
you
force
to
live
on
the
streets
while
you
raid
protests
and
criminalize
people
that
are
standing
up
for
rights
of
migrants
and
asylum
seekers
you
want
to
give
me
a
medal
for
actions
that
you
fight
in
your
own
ramparts
klemp
wrote
in
the
scathing
post
it
is
time
we
call
out
hypocrite
honorings
and
fill
the
void
with
social
justice
she
said
she
went
on
to
say
that
people
don't
need
medals
we
do
not
need
authorities
deciding
about
who
is
a
hero
and
who
is
illegal
she
said
in
fact
they
are
in
no
position
to
make
this
call
because
we
are
all
equal
klemp
and
nine
of
her
shipmates
have
been
under
investigation
in
italy
after
authorities
impounded
her
ship
the
iuventa
in
august
for
years
authorities
there
have
railed
against
work
by
rescue
organizations
like
sea
watch
that
pick
up
stranded
migrants
fleeing
the
libyan
coast
for
europe
more
recently
italy's
populist
interior
minister
matteo
salvini
introduced
a
controversial
security
decree
banning
ngo
migrant
ships
from
entering
italian
ports
as
a
result
klemp
and
her
team
have
been
accused
of
aiding
human
trafficking
the
iuventa
formerly
a
fishing
vessel
is
estimated
to
have
saved
people
as
npr's
sylvia
poggioli
reported
migrants
from
libya
and
other
countries
torn
apart
by
violence
had
been
risking
their
lives
crossing
the
rough
waters
of
the
mediterranean
arriving
on
european
shores
in
huge
numbers
for
several
years
but
as
of
there
has
been
a
dramatic
reduction
in
asylum-seekers
there's
been
a
huge
drop
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
compared
with
about
the
year
before
that's
an
drop
poggioli
said
the
prestigious
medal
for
bravery
was
awarded
to
klemp
and
captain
carola
rackete
in
july
like
klemp
rackete
defied
italian
authorities
when
she
rescued
more
than
migrants
off
the
coast
of
libya
and
rammed
her
way
into
a
port
on
the
italian
island
of
lampedusa
she
was
subsequently
arrested
and
charged
with
human
smuggling
but
the
charges
were
dropped
klemp's
refusal
to
accept
the
medal
comes
on
the
heels
of
a
day
standoff
between
a
spanish
rescue
ship
called
open
arms
and
the
italian
government
on
tuesday
an
italian
court
ordered
the
seizure
of
the
ship
and
the
evacuation
of
everyone
onboard
on
lampedusa
five
countries
belonging
to
the
european
union
have
agreed
to
accept
the
migrants
both
the
german
and
french
governments
have
criticized
italy
over
the
treatment
of
migrants
klemp
and
rackete
salvini's
retort
is
that
the
eu's
other
member
countries
should
open
their
borders
to
welcome
the
influx
the
city
of
paris
is
fully
mobilised
to
support
the
refugees
to
shelter
them
and
ensure
a
dignified
respect
for
their
humanity
