m
et
days
after
the
united
states
tested
a
new
cruise
missile
russian
president
vladimir
putin
is
calling
for
a
symmetrical
response
his
order
comes
weeks
after
the
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
a
landmark
arms
control
agreement
between
washington
and
moscow
collapsed
on
aug
amid
concerns
of
a
renewed
arms
race
putin
told
russia's
defense
ministry
and
other
agencies
to
study
the
level
of
threat
posed
by
these
us
actions
and
take
exhaustive
measures
to
prepare
a
symmetrical
response
according
to
russia-backed
outlet
rt
he
said
russia
was
aware
that
the
u.s.
had
been
developing
prohibited
weapons
for
quite
a
long
time
a
senior
trump
administration
official
told
reporters
earlier
this
month
that
the
united
states
would
flight-test
a
weapon
system
in
the
coming
weeks
and
on
sunday
the
u.s.
department
of
defense
tested
a
modified
navy
tomahawk
cruise
missile
off
the
coast
of
california
the
pentagon
said
it
accurately
impacted
its
target
flying
more
than
miles
a
distance
that
would
have
breached
the
limits
established
by
the
now
obsolete
inf
treaty
defense
department
spokesman
lt
col
robert
carver
told
npr
that
the
united
states
began
conceptual
design
activities
on
ground-launched
cruise
missile
and
ballistic
missile
systems
in
february
after
the
u.s.
suspended
its
obligations
under
the
arms
control
treaty
this
test
is
a
tangible
demonstration
of
that
commitment
he
said
because
the
u.s.
has
adhered
to
the
inf
treaty
previously
u.s.
efforts
to
develop
new
capability
are
just
getting
started
a
deadly
explosion
at
a
missile
test
facility
in
russia's
arctic
northwest
has
led
to
questions
about
moscow's
capabilities
scientists
there
are
believed
to
have
been
testing
what
nato
has
code
named
skyfall
a
m
burevestnik
cruise
missile
propelled
by
a
small
nuclear
reactor
that
would
give
it
a
nearly
limitless
flying
range
at
least
five
scientists
were
killed
radiation
levels
spiked
nearby
and
several
radiation
detectors
subsequently
went
offline
putin
said
that
russia
was
forced
to
develop
new
weapons
ever
since
the
bush
administration
formally
pulled
out
of
the
anti-ballistic
missile
treaty
in
the
russian
president
insisted
on
friday
that
he
would
not
be
drawn
into
an
arms
race
with
the
united
states
he
said
that
russia
has
never
wanted
does
not
want
and
will
not
want
to
engage
in
a
costly
arms
race
that
would
damage
our
economy
