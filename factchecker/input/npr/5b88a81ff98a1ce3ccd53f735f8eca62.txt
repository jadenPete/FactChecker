craig
who
has
pleaded
not

was
born
out
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
probe
during
its
investigation
mueller's
team
uncovered
evidence
of
alleged
wrongdoing
by
craig
but
referred
the
material
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
prosecution
it
is
one
of
several
cases
to
emerge
from
the
mueller
inquiry
that
allege
violations
of
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
the
law
known
as
fara
requires
that
people
doing
political
or
public
relations
work
in
the
u.s.
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
entity
disclose
that
fact
it
is
illegal
to
willfully
not
register
or
to
provide
false
or
misleading
statements
to
the
justice
department's
fara
unit
in
craig's
case
prosecutors
say
he
did
just
that
in
connection
with
his
work
for
the
ukrainian
government
the
indictment
alleges
that
craig
withheld
information
that
he
knew
he
should
have
provided
to
the
department
and
provided
other
information
that
he
knew
was
incorrect
craig's
lawyers
william
w.
taylor
iii
and
william
j.
murphy
of
the
law
firm
zuckerman
spaeder
have
denied
that
craig
broke
the
law
in
a
statement
at
the
time
of
the
indictment
they
called
the
government's
prosecution
a
misguided
abuse
of
prosecutorial
discretion
the
case
against
craig
dates
back
to
work
he
and
his
law
firm
skadden
arps
slate
meagher
flom
did
for
ukraine's
pro-russian
government
in
paul
manafort
who
was
advising
the
government
in
kiev
at
the
time
helped
hire
craig
and
skadden
to
draw
up
a
report
on
the
government's
prosecution
of
former
prime
minister
yulia
tymoshenko
manafort
of
course
later
became
trump's
campaign
chairman
in
before
quitting
the
post
amid
questions
about
his
ukraine
work
he
was
later
convicted
in
a
bank
and
tax
fraud
trial
in
virginia
brought
by
mueller's
team
internationally
the
case
against
tymoshenko
was
viewed
as
a
politically
motivated
sham
pushed
by
her
rival
then-president
viktor
yanukovych
after
it
was
brought
on
board
skadden
drew
up
a
report
that
validated
the
tymoshenko
prosecution
craig
then
allegedly
briefed
journalists
to
shape
early
international
coverage
of
the
report
craig
and
skadden
however
did
not
register
their
activities
with
the
justice
department
prosecutors
say
craig
did
not
register
his
work
with
the
justice
department
in
order
to
avoid
disclosing
that
craig
and
skadden
had
been
paid
million
for
the
work
publicizing
that
fact
would
have
undermined
the
perceived
independence
and
credibility
of
the
report
prosecutors
say
early
this
year
skadden
reached
a
settlement
of
its
own
with
the
justice
department
that
allowed
it
to
avoid
prosecution
it
agreed
to
register
under
fara
and
pay
about
million
craig's
trial
opens
monday
with
jury
selection
the
trial
is
expected
to
last
weeks
