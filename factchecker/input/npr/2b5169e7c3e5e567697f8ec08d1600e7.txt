in

the
trump
administration
is
following
up
on
president
trump's
threat
to
go
after
california
for
pollution
that
he
blames
on
the
state's
large
homeless
population
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
sent
a
letter
to
gov
gavin
newsom
thursday
expressing
concern
that
he
is
failing
to
enforce
the
clean
water
act
trump
said
after
a
visit
to
california
last
week
that
san
francisco
is
violating
pollution
laws
by
allowing
needles
and
other
waste
from
homeless
encampments
to
drain
into
the
ocean
san
francisco
mayor
london
breed
responded
to
the
letter
rejecting
trump's
claims
i'm
sick
of
this
president
taking
swipes
at
our
city
for
no
reason
other
than
politics
breed
said
as
i've
said
before
there
are
no
needles
washing
out
to
the
bay
or
ocean
from
our
sewer
system
and
there
is
no
relationship
between
homelessness
and
water
quality
in
san
francisco
the
epa
letter
expands
trump's
complaints
saying
that
the
state
is
not
acting
with
enough
urgency
to
address
environmental
problems
related
to
homelessness
california
is
responsible
for
implementing
appropriate
municipal
storm
water
management
and
waste
treatment
requirements
as
part
of
its
assumed
federal
program
wheeler
wrote
the
state
is
failing
to
properly
implement
these
programs
the
letter
said
the
alleged
violations
put
nearly
residents
at
risk
wheeler
asked
newsom
to
respond
in
days
about
what
the
state
plans
to
do
about
it
a
spokesman
for
the
governor
also
responded
to
the
letter
the
president
is
abusing
the
powers
of
the
presidency
and
weaponizing
government
to
attack
his
political
opponents
this
is
not
about
clean
air
clean
water
or
helping
our
state
with
homelessness
said
nathan
click
spokesman
for
newsom
this
is
political
retribution
against
california
plain
and
simple
the
trump
administration
and
california
are
in
an
escalating
fight
over
a
range
of
issues
including
homelessness
the
environment
and
immigration
during
a
fundraising
trip
to
california
last
week
the
president
portrayed
the
homeless
as
harmful
to
the
state
if
these
democrat
liberal
politicians
don't
straighten
it
out
the
federal
government
will
have
to
come
in
we're
not
going
to
lose
cities
like
los
angeles
san
francisco
and
others
that
are
great
cities
we're
not
going
to
allow
that
to
happen
to
our
cities
trump
also
said
homeless
people
scare
away
foreigners
who
want
to
live
in
those
cities
trump's
statements
have
provoked
the
ire
of
homeless
advocates
in
california
david
lewis
the
executive
director
of
environmental
group
save
the
bay
said
trump's
sudden
interest
in
the
homeless
crisis
is
purely
political
the
way
to
reduce
the
impacts
from
homeless
encampments
is
to
reduce
homelessness
said
lewis
earlier
this
week
wheeler
sent
a
letter
to
the
california
air
resources
board
accusing
the
state
of
having
the
worst
air
quality
in
the
united
states
he
threatened
to
withdraw
billions
of
dollars
in
federal
highway
money
if
the
situation
does
not
improve
