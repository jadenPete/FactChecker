russia
should

russia's
foreign
ministry
has
welcomed
his
remarks
speaking
with
reporters
in
the
oval
office
on
tuesday
before
his
scheduled
trip
to
france
for
the
g-
summit
trump
encouraged
moscow's
return
to
the
elite
group
i
think
it's
much
more
appropriate
to
have
russia
in
he
said
it
should
be
the
g-
because
a
lot
of
the
things
we
talk
about
have
to
do
with
russia
trump
blamed
obama
for
russia's
ouster
claiming
that
it
was
the
result
of
his
predecessor's
humiliation
on
the
world
stage
offering
little
to
substantiate
his
claim
trump
said
president
obama
didn't
want
russia
in
because
he
got
outsmarted
russia
was
excluded
from
the
g-
in
after
its
troops
invaded
ukraine
and
president
vladimir
putin
annexed
crimea
western
leaders
condemned
the
actions
as
a
clear
violation
of
international
law
and
sought
to
penalize
the
russian
government
on
wednesday
russian
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
maria
zakharova
appeared
to
embrace
the
door
trump
opened
according
to
russia's
news
agency
tass
initiatives
need
to
be
outlined
and
handed
over
to
russia
for
consideration
zakharova
said
at
the
moment
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
it
is
all
about
so
if
the
g
wants
to
position
itself
as
a
serious
platform
the
discussion
should
be
moved
from
the
media
field
to
the
expert
level
trump's
appeal
on
tuesday
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
called
on
the
group
france
germany
britain
canada
italy
and
japan
to
bring
russia
back
into
the
fold
in
june
trump
told
reporters
that
we
should
have
russia
at
the
negotiating
table
his
remarks
on
tuesday
did
not
include
a
mention
of
crimea
or
any
conditions
for
russia
to
be
reinstated
another
leader
french
president
emmanuel
macron
has
called
on
moscow
to
help
end
the
conflict
in
ukraine
ahead
of
the
summit
but
at
a
meeting
with
putin
in
southern
france
on
monday
macron
also
championed
russia
as
a
european
nation
russia
is
european
deeply
european
macron
said
we
believe
in
this
europe
which
stretches
from
lisbon
portugal
to
vladivostok
russia
brookings
institution
fellow
alina
polyakova
told
npr
that
trump's
comments
are
not
surprising
because
he
has
made
similar
comments
in
the
past
the
u.s.
has
maintained
sanctions
on
russia
despite
the
president's
consistent
pro-russian
remarks
polyakova
said
but
the
view
on
russia
could
be
softening
elsewhere
she
added
pointing
to
macron's
comments
the
summit
started
in
when
leaders
of
six
industrial
countries
met
at
the
chateau
de
rambouillet
an
hour
outside
paris
to
discuss
the
economic
crisis
