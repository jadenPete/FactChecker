justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
finished
three
weeks
of
radiation
treatment
for
a
tumor
on
her
pancreas
but
she
told
a
crowd
on
saturday
that
she
is
on
her
way
to
being
very
well
ginsburg
speaking
with
npr's
nina
totenberg
at
the
library
of
congress
national
book
festival
in
washington
d.c.
said
she
would
be
prepared
for
the
start
of
the
supreme
court's
term
in
october
ginsburg's
latest
round
of
radiation
therapy
began
on
aug
shortly
after
doctors
confirmed
the
presence
of
a
localized
malignant
tumor
on
her
pancreas
a
stent
was
also
placed
in
her
bile
duct
as
part
of
the
cancer
treatment
according
to
a
statement
issued
by
the
u.s.
supreme
court
doctors
at
memorial
sloan
kettering
cancer
center
in
new
york
where
the
year-old
justice
was
treated
this
month
on
an
outpatient
basis
found
no
evidence
of
cancer
anywhere
else
in
ginsburg's
body
justice
ginsburg
will
continue
to
have
periodic
blood
tests
and
scans
said
the
court's
statement
no
further
treatment
is
needed
at
this
time
ginsburg
has
had
multiple
cancer
bouts
over
the
past
two
decades
late
last
year
she
had
surgery
for
lung
cancer
ginsburg's
health
remains
a
constant
subject
of
scrutiny
because
if
she
were
to
leave
the
court
before
the
end
of
president
donald
trump's
term
republicans
would
likely
move
quickly
to
replace
her
with
a
conservative
justice
and
solidify
a
to-
conservative
majority
on
saturday
ginsburg
said
her
work
on
the
supreme
court
has
helped
her
get
through
cancer
instead
of
concentrating
on
my
aches
and
pains
i
just
know
that
i
have
to
read
this
set
of
briefs
go
over
the
draft
opinion
she
said
and
so
i
have
to
somehow
surmount
whatever
is
going
on
in
my
body
and
concentrate
on
the
court's
work
when
asked
how
she
was
feeling
ginsburg
quipped
well
first
this
audience
can
see
that
i
am
alive
the
festival
crowd
cheered
the
comment
echoed
what
ginsburg
said
to
npr's
totenberg
in
an
interview
earlier
this
year
ginsburg
mentioned
a
senator
who
once
announced
that
he
thought
she
would
be
dead
within
six
months
that
senator
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
is
now
himself
dead
and
i
am
very
much
alive
the
justice
said
npr's
totenberg
recently
reported
that
during
the
three
weeks
of
august
cancer
treatment
ginsburg
often
went
out
in
the
evening
to
movies
the
opera
and
the
theater
