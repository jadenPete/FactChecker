w.
bush
according
to
o'brien's
official
biography
o'brien
alongside
trump
in
l.a.
said
the
u.s.
faces
a
number
of
challenges
but
we
have
a
great
team
in
place
mentioning
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
defense
secretary
mark
esper
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
the
iran
crisis
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
immediately
facing
the
trump
administration's
national
security
team
are
the
rising
tensions
with
iran
following
the
weekend
strike
on
a
saudi
arabian
refinery
complex
which
the
u.s.
and
the
saudi
government
have
blamed
on
tehran
saudi
officials
laid
out
what
they
called
the
evidence
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
on
the
saudi
aramco
refinery
in
a
presentation
on
wednesday
in
the
kingdom's
capital
of
riyadh
trump
said
the
u.s.
has
many
options
for
dealing
with
iran
but
that
the
was
not
ready
to
use
what
he
called
the
ultimate
option
going
to
war
trump
said
the
administration
would
outline
additional
sanctions
against
iran
in
the
next
few
days
praise
for
selection
of
o'brien
sen
mitt
romney
r-utah
for
whom
o'brien
served
as
a
national
security
adviser
during
romney's
presidential
campaign
welcomed
the
appointment
national
security
insiders
also
hailed
the
choice
patrick
cronin
asia-pacific
security
chair
for
the
hudson
institute
said
o'brien
has
a
razor-sharp
mind
and
a
diplomatic
demeanor
and
andrew
exum
who
served
as
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
middle
east
policy
toward
the
end
of
president
barack
obama's
administration
wrote
on
twitter
that
o'brien
is
a
good
man
who's
been
given
a
challenging
role
o'brien
does
not
require
senate
confirmation
to
move
into
his
new
job
he
will
be
trump's
fourth
national
security
adviser
and
enter
an
administration
that
has
become
known
for
turnover
trump
entered
office
with
retired
lt
gen
mike
flynn
who
was
removed
due
to
his
role
in
the
russia
imbroglio
and
who
has
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
the
fbi
taking
his
place
was
lt
gen
h.r.
mcmaster
with
whom
trump
did
not
click
personally
the
split
between
those
two
men
created
the
opening
that
bolton
filled
last
year
bolton's
commentary
on
fox
news
and
elsewhere
appealed
to
trump
but
his
hawkish
positions
once
he
was
back
inside
government
ultimately
estranged
him
from
the
president
and
other
advisers
