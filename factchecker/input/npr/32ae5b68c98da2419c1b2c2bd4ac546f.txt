former
fbi
director
james
comey
violated
official
policy
in
the
way
he
handled
his
memos
describing
his
exchanges
with
president
trump
an
investigation
concluded
but
comey
won't
be
charged
justice
department
inspector
general
michael
horowitz
conducted
the
investigation
into
comey's
actions
and
then
referred
his
results
to
prosecutors
after
reviewing
the
matter
the
doj
declined
prosecution
the
inspector
general's
office
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
investigators
concluded
that
comey
broke
several
rules
one
involved
the
former
director's
decision
to
arrange
for
a
friend
to
disclose
the
contents
of
a
memo
to
a
new
york
times
reporter
another
involved
comey's
decision
to
keep
memos
at
home
and
discuss
them
with
his
lawyers
but
not
reveal
to
the
fbi
their
contents
or
what
he
was
doing
fbi
officials
have
since
assessed
that
some
of
the
material
in
comey's
memos
deserved
to
be
classified
as
confidential
the
lowest
level
of
classification
but
investigators
didn't
establish
that
comey
revealed
any
secret
information
to
the
press
the
former
fbi
director
responded
on
twitter
on
thursday
morning
by
quoting
a
section
of
the
inspector
general's
report
and
pointing
out
what
he
called
all
the
untruthful
things
said
about
him
and
other
matters
by
president
trump
and
trump's
supporters
witness
comey
by
his
account
began
recording
details
about
his
conversations
with
trump
as
soon
as
they
met
for
a
national
security
briefing
in
new
york
city
comey
then
the
fbi
director
briefed
the
then-president-elect
on
the
existence
of
the
infamous
unverified
russia
dossier
and
trump's
conduct
in
that
meeting
prompted
comey
to
begin
typing
up
an
account
of
it
in
his
fbi
vehicle
immediately
afterward
comey
also
wrote
about
exchanges
in
which
he
said
trump
invited
him
for
a
solo
meeting
at
the
white
house
and
asked
for
his
loyalty
in
a
conversation
in
which
comey
said
he
agreed
always
to
give
trump
his
honesty
in
another
memo
comey
described
a
meeting
in
the
oval
office
in
which
he
said
the
president
asked
him
to
stay
behind
after
a
larger
conference
with
just
the
two
of
them
present
comey
wrote
trump
asked
him
whether
he
could
let
go
of
the
investigation
into
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
flynn
had
stepped
down
over
conflicting
statements
to
white
house
officials
and
the
public
about
his
conversations
with
russia's
ambassador
during
the
presidential
transition
flynn
has
since
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
investigators
about
that
exchange
in
which
he
sought
and
russia
agreed
to
no
escalation
by
moscow
in
response
to
the
diplomatic
measures
being
taken
by
outgoing
president
barack
obama
in
retaliation
for
russia's
interference
in
the
presidential
race
trump
later
fired
comey
that
move
plunged
washington
into
a
vortex
of
paranoia
and
suspicion
and
the
appearance
of
some
of
the
details
of
comey's
memos
in
the
press
contributed
to
an
atmosphere
that
prompted
then-deputy
attorney
general
rod
rosenstein
to
commission
a
special
counsel
for
the
investigation
into
russia's
political
interference
he
appointed
former
fbi
director
robert
mueller
whose
nearly
two-year
investigation
revealed
many
links
between
trump's
campaign
and
russians
but
no
criminal
conspiracy
to
throw
the
election
mueller's
investigation
also
uncovered
what
critics
have
called
criminal
behavior
by
trump
who
sought
to
control
or
quash
the
inquiry
the
showboat
the
president
has
called
comey
a
showboat
and
mueller's
inquiry
a
witch
hunt
he
and
his
supporters
also
have
pointed
out
that
mueller
not
only
ultimately
was
permitted
to
continue
his
work
but
didn't
bring
any
criminal
charges
involving
direct
collusion
between
trump's
campaign
and
the
russians
the
results
of
the
horowitz
investigation
establishing
that
comey
did
violate
several
rules
and
policies
has
already
reignited
trump's
and
his
supporters
criticism
of
the
fbi
and
the
justice
department
which
they
have
savaged
over
alleged
bias
republican
rep
doug
collins
of
georgia
ranking
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
said
the
inspector
general's
report
further
cements
the
need
for
us
to
get
to
the
root
of
how
the
russia
investigation
began
it's
time
to
restore
americans
confidence
that
federal
law
enforcement
is
committed
to
justice
and
free
from
political
gamesmanship
a
statement
from
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
on
thursday
afternoon
called
comey
a
proven
liar
and
leaker
because
comey
shamefully
leaked
information
to
the
press
in
blatant
violation
of
fbi
policies
the
nation
was
forced
to
endure
the
baseless
politically
motivated
two-year
witch
hunt
the
statement
continued
comey
disgraced
himself
and
his
office
to
further
a
personal
political
agenda
and
this
report
further
confirms
that
fact
attorney
general
william
barr
told
lawmakers
in
april
that
he
had
launched
an
informal
inquiry
into
the
origins
of
the
russia
investigation
