how
does
one
man
have
so
much
power
one
hears
that
question
asked
in
washington
a
lot
these
days
often
with
exasperation
and
bewilderment
and
it
is
not
always
a
reference
to
president
trump
quite
often
the
man
in
question
is
mitch
mcconnell
the
republican
senator
from
kentucky
the
man
who
calls
himself
the
grim
reaper
of
signature
democratic
initiatives
mcconnell's
status
stems
from
his
office
as
the
senate
majority
leader
elected
by
his
party
colleagues
to
lead
their
conference
in
the
chamber
but
few
who
have
held
this
office
have
been
able
to
wield
it
with
this
kind
of
results
in
today's
senate
mcconnell
can
decide
virtually
by
himself
what
the
chamber
will
do
and
even
what
it
will
consider
doing
you
may
have
first
noticed
mcconnell
early
in
when
he
proclaimed
the
senate
would
not
consider
any
nominee
appointed
by
president
obama
to
fill
the
supreme
court
seat
vacated
by
the
death
of
antonin
scalia
mcconnell
made
this
announcement
on
his
own
within
hours
of
scalia's
death
this
year
mcconnell
has
issued
similar
summary
judgments
on
house-passed
bills
to
reform
election
laws
combat
foreign
interference
in
u.s.
elections
and
strengthen
gun
control
in
each
of
these
instances
the
question
arose
how
can
one
man
make
this
kind
of
momentous
decision
and
make
it
stick
mcconnell
is
a
master
of
senate
procedure
and
rules
he
is
also
a
remarkable
politician
as
npr
reporters
have
detailed
for
decades
and
as
kelly
mcevers
has
documented
in
her
five-part
series
on
the
npr
embedded
podcast
this
summer
emerging
bosses
of
the
senate
but
how
much
of
mcconnell's
power
comes
from
his
position
as
majority
leader
how
big
a
deal
is
the
job
itself
through
most
of
our
history
there
wasn't
one
and
since
the
office
was
created
a
century
ago
its
occupant
has
typically
been
little
known
outside
of
washington
everyone
knows
the
most
powerful
member
of
the
house
is
the
speaker
a
title
that
is
found
in
article
i
of
the
u.s.
constitution
as
written
in
successive
generations
have
rewritten
the
definition
somewhat
but
the
position
remains
enormously
influential
for
its
power
to
bring
bills
to
the
floor
or
ignore
them
the
office
of
senate
majority
leader
does
not
appear
in
any
of
the
founding
documents
the
speaker
ranks
high
in
the
line
of
presidential
succession
right
after
the
vice
president
the
senate
majority
leader's
position
in
the
succession
is
nowhere
the
founding
fathers
saw
the
senate
as
a
small
body
initially
about
two
dozen
that
would
largely
govern
itself
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
president
of
the
senate
a
job
assigned
to
whoever
happened
to
be
vice
president
of
the
united
states
if
the
veep
was
unavailable
the
task
of
presiding
passed
to
a
senator
designated
as
the
senate
president
pro
tempore
the
presiding
officer
for
the
time
being
as
the
senate
evolved
the
idea
of
the
presiding
officer
atrophied
in
importance
the
vice
president
stopped
attending
senate
sessions
except
for
ceremonial
occasions
or
to
cast
a
tiebreaking
vote
the
senate
was
largely
run
by
its
strongest
personalities
and
committee
chairmen
the
job
of
official
majority
or
minority
leader
in
the
senate
did
not
even
exist
until
about
a
century
ago
in
the
era
around
the
world
war
i
when
the
constitution
had
just
been
changed
to
elect
senators
by
popular
vote
rather
than
by
state
legislators
the
democrats
started
designating
a
leader
in
republicans
had
an
acknowledged
leader
at
the
time
in
henry
cabot
lodge
of
massachusetts
but
they
did
not
officially
designate
one
until
the
mid-
s
since
then
the
elected
leaders
of
the
majority
and
minority
parties
have
been
the
titular
bosses
although
largely
beholden
to
the
barons

of

the

democrat
for
whom
the
original

named
johnson
grew
rapidly
in
the

finding
it
possible
through
force

others
have
also
left
a
mark
in
a
relatively
short
time
in
the
job
many
republicans
still
revere
robert
a.
taft
who
had
the
job
for
just
six
months
before
his
death
in
george
mitchell
of
maine
was
widely
admired
for
his
execution
of
the
job
for
the
democrats
for
six
years
four
under
president
bill
clinton
more
recently
the
job
had
passed
from
one
able
and
ambitious
politician
to
another
without
much
change
in
its
status
it
came
to
be
mocked
by
some
as
the
majority
follower
as
some
who
had
the
job
struggled
mightily
to
form
consensus
within
their
ranks
some
have
also
found
being
the
leader
was
hazardous
to
their
political
health
back
home
or
hobbling
for
their
presidential
ambitions
mcconnell's
tenure
in
the
leader
position
mcconnell's
predecessor
as
republican
leader
was
bill
frist
of
tennessee
he
got
the
job
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
when
trent
lott
of
mississippi
resigned
a
distinguished
heart
surgeon
frist
had
not
been
in
leadership
before
and
never
seemed
at
ease
in
the
job
but
he
benefited
by
having
a
more
seasoned
deputy
mitch
mcconnell
who
then
stepped
up
to
be
the
party's
no
upon
frist's
retirement
in
he
has
held
that
spot
since
so
mcconnell's
current
power
is
not
inherent
in
his
title
nor
is
he
so
personally
compelling
that
he
bends
the
will
of
others
to
his
own
in
the
manner
of
lbj
mcconnell
has
his
remarkable
power
in
the
nation's
affairs
right
now
because
his
own
position
has
become
a
pivotal
nexus
for
other
forces
in
republican
politics
the
election
of
donald
trump
in
the
loss
of
the
party's
majority
in
the
house
in
the
extraordinary
cohesiveness
of
the
republican
senate
in
its
public
support
of
the
president
and
the
sense
of
momentous
demographic
and
social
change
coming
in
the
decades
ahead
have
made
the
job
of
senate
majority
leader
more
important
it
is
now
perhaps
more
important
to
the
gop
than
ever
before

the
most
evident
of
these
forces
is
of
course
the
election
of
trump
mcconnell
was
not
onboard
the
trump
train
in
the
early
stages
of
the
cycle
he
officially
backed
rand
paul
the
republican
junior
senator
from
his
own
home
state
when
paul
dropped
out
mcconnell
stayed
neutral
he
was
critical
of
trump
at
times
but
did
not
join
the
active
resistance
to
his
nomination
control
of
the
senate
was
very
much
up
for
grabs
in
the
cycle
and
at
times
it
appeared
likely
trump
would
lose
to
hillary
clinton
and
depress
republican
turnout
in
the
process
that
was
seen
as
damaging
or
even
fatal
to
the
prospects
of
several
republicans
in
close
races
mcconnell
could
see
his
status
in
the
majority
slipping
away
after
having
it
just
two
years
so
he
calibrated
his
responses
to
campaign
events
carefully
at
one
point
he
simply
refused
to
take
any
questions
at
all
regarding
the
party's
presidential
nominee
nonetheless
when
trump
won
mcconnell
was
right
there
to
offer
his
full-throated
support
and
within
days
the
new
relationship
was
cemented
by
trump's
appointment
of
mcconnell's
wife
elaine
chao
as
secretary
of
transportation
chao
had
been
secretary
of
labor
for
all
eight
years
of
george
w.
bush's
presidency
while
their
backgrounds
and
lifetime
experiences
are
worlds
apart
mcconnell
and
trump
share
an
approach
to
politics
that
is
more
transactional
than
ideological
both
embrace
a
robust
form
of
free
market
capitalism
with
incentives
for
business
emphasized
over
taxes
and
regulation
but
like
trump
mcconnell
has
found
success
as
an
organizer
of
political
energy
and
power
more
than
as
a
thought
leader
mcconnell
was
not
able
to
deliver
the
clean
repeal
of
affordable
care
act
also
known
as
obamacare
that
trump
wanted
but
blame
for
that
fell
on
the
late
sen
john
mccain
whose
dramatic
thumbs-down
doomed
the
repeal
in
mcconnell
did
however
get
credit
for
steering
the
big
tax
cut
through
the
senate
labyrinth
later
that
year
and
mcconnell
has
been
crucial
in
securing
the
single
clearest
accomplishment
of
the
trump
presidency
to
date
the
confirmation
of
more
than
federal
judges
including
two
supreme
court
justices
mcconnell
has
been
able
to
establish
a
veritable
assembly
line
for
judicial
confirmations
because
he
disarmed
the
democratic
minority
by
changing
the
rules
of
the
senate
he
first
eliminated
the
use
of
extended
debate
or
filibuster
to
delay
or
defeat
nominees
to
the
supreme
court
democrats
had
left
the
filibuster
in
place
for
the
supreme
court
when
they
eliminated
it
for
other
presidential
appointments
such
as
cabinet
members
then
mcconnell
changed
the
procedures
for
processing
other
judicial
appointments
procedures
republican
senators
had
used
to
hold
up
scores
of
judicial
nominees
during
the
obama
presidency
leaving
open
the
very
vacancies
that
trump
and
mcconnell
have
since
filled
none
of
this
would
be
possible
of
course
without
the
remarkable
degree
of
cohesion
and
loyalty
mcconnell
has
commanded
within
his
own
party
in
the
senate
while
individual
republicans
have
at
times
complained
privately
about
the
president
or
the
majority
leader
they
have
stood
by
the
two
of
them
on
virtually
every
vote
since
the
obamacare
failure
an
exception
that
tends
to
prove
the
rule
was
the
senate
vote
to
block
certain
arms
sales
to
saudi
arabia
the
president
vetoed
that
and
the
senate
upheld
his
veto
the
latest
example
was
the
senate's
acquiescence
in
passing
the
two-year
budget
deal
that
suspended
the
debt
ceiling
until
and
lifted
caps
on
both
military
and
domestic
spending
the
bill
required
conservative
republican
senators
to
swallow
more
than
trillion
in
new
debt
in
each
of
the
next
two
budget
years
and
the
high
likelihood
of
still
higher
deficits
thereafter
moreover
the
administration
had
negotiated
it
primarily
with
speaker
nancy
pelosi
yet
when
the
time
came
for
the
crucial
vote
mcconnell
delivered
enough
republicans
to
get
it
done
another
example
of
how
the
trump
era
at
least
on
capitol
hill
is
best
understood
as
the
trump-mcconnell
era
