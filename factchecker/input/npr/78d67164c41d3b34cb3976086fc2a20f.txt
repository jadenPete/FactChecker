saudi
attack
draws
new
u.s.
sanctions
against
iran
the
trump
administration
ordered
new
economic
sanctions
against
iran
friday
in
response
to
the
attack
last
weekend
in
saudi
arabia
the
sanctions
target
iran's
central
bank
and
its
sovereign
wealth
fund
this
is
very
big
said
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
we've
now
cut
off
all
sources
of
funds
to
iran
the
move
comes
less
than
a
week
after
an
attack
on
a
saudi
oil
facility
that
temporarily
cut
off
nearly
of
the
world's
oil
supply
while
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
claimed
responsibility
for
that
attack
the
administration
suspects
iran
was
behind
it
it's
too
bad
what's
happening
with
iran
it's
going
to
hell
president
trump
told
reporters
friday
in
announcing
the
sanctions
they're
practically
broke
they
are
broke
and
they
could
solve
the
problem
very
easily
all
they
have
to
do
is
stop
with
the
terror
the
sanctions
are
designed
to
sever
any
remaining
ties
between
iran
and
the
u.s.
financial
system
the
order
from
the
treasury
department
bars
americans
from
doing
business
with
iran's
central
bank
and
its
national
development
fund
attacking
other
nations
and
disrupting
the
global
economy
has
a
price
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
in
a
statement
the
regime
in
tehran
must
be
held
accountable
through
diplomatic
isolation
and
economic
pressure
the
practical
impact
of
the
new
sanctions
could
be
limited
though
since
iran
was
already
subject
to
numerous
economic
restrictions
this
is
more
symbolic
than
practical
in
consequence
said
richard
nephew
who
was
a
sanctions
expert
in
the
state
department
during
the
obama
administration
and
advised
the
team
that
negotiated
with
iran
it
is
hard
to
see
what
new
economic
impact
will
result
the
sanctions
could
add
complications
for
those
trying
to
deliver
humanitarian
supplies
to
iran
although
treasury
said
it
will
continue
to
consider
waivers
for
deliveries
of
food
and
medicine
as
appropriate
there
is
no
bigger
loser
of
this
policy
than
the
iranian
people
warned
ryan
costello
policy
director
of
the
nonprofit
national
iranian
american
council
he
noted
that
despite
earlier
sanctions
iran's
central
bank
continued
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
trade
of
humanitarian
goods
without
a
carve-out
for
that
activity
higher
prices
for
food
and
shortages
of
western
drugs
could
result
costello
warned
at
a
white
house
news
conference
trump
said
he
has
shown
restraint
toward
iran
he
did
not
rule
out
a
military
response
to
the
attack
in
saudi
arabia
but
stressed
he
is
in
no
hurry
going
into
iran
would
be
a
very
easy
decision
trump
said
i
think
the
sanctions
work
and
the
military
would
work
but
that's
a
very
severe
form
of
winning
