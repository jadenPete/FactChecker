says
the
repeal
of
obama-era
water
rules
will
end
an
overreach
by
the
federal
government
the
trump
administration
is
changing
the
definition
of
what
qualifies
as
waters
of
the
united
states
tossing
out
an
obama-era
regulation
that
had
enhanced
protections
for
wetlands
and
smaller
waterways
thursday's
rollback
is
the
first
step
in
a
process
that
will
allow
the
trump
administration
to
create
its
own
definition
of
which
waters
deserve
federal
protection
a
new
rule
is
expected
to
be
finalized
this
winter
the
repeal
ends
an
egregious
power
grab

agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
says
he
adds
that
the
rule
had
provoked
states
to
file
complaints
and
petitions
for
legal
review
we're
delivering
on
the
president's
regulatory
reform
agenda
wheeler
says
the
epa
chief
unveiled
the
shift
in
u.s.
water
policy
thursday
during
an
event
at
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
headquarters
in
washington
d.c.
wheeler
spoke
alongside
assistant
secretary
of
the
army
for
civil
works
r.d.
james
who
joined
him
in
signing
the
repeal
of
the
rule
adding
that
the
epa
has
already
finalized
deregulatory
actions
under
president
trump
wheeler
says
the
agency
has
an
additional
actions
in
development
the
repeal
has
been
anticipated
for
a
long
time
npr's
nathan
rott
reports
he
adds
developers
mining
companies
and
farmers
painted
the
regulation
as
a
massive
federal
overreach
environmental
groups
and
the
obama
administration
argued
wider
protections
are
needed
to
protect
the
nation's
complicated
water
systems
from
pollution
in
response
to
the
epa's
action
jon
devine
director
of
federal
water
policy
at
the
natural
resources
defense
council
issued
a
statement
saying
this
unsubstantiated
action
is
illegal
and
will
certainly
be
challenged
in
court
trump
first
ordered
a
review
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states
rule
in
february
he
said
at
the
time
that
while
it
is
in
the
national
interest
to
ensure
that
the
nation's
navigable
waters
are
kept
free
from
pollution
the
policy
must
also
promote
economic
growth
and
minimize
regulatory
uncertainty
and
not
overstep
states
authority
as
npr
reported
when
the
repeal
process
was
resumed
late
last
year
under
epa's
proposal
the
only
wetlands
that
will
be
federally
protected
are
those
that
are
adjacent
to
a
major
body
of
water
or
ones
that
are
connected
to
a
major
waterway
by
surface
water
since
it
was
published
in
the
federal
register
earlier
this
year
the
epa's
proposal
to
revise
the
definition
of
waters
of
the
united
states
often
referred
to
as
wotus
has
drawn
more
than
comments
the
trump
administration
has
repealed
a
number
of
environmental
regulations
from
the
previous
administration
in
many
cases
triggering
lawsuits
from
conservation
and
environmental
organizations
