a
federal
jury
on
wednesday
found
the
prominent
washington
lawyer
greg
craig
who
worked
for
two
democratic
presidents
not
guilty
of
making
false
statements
to
the
justice
department
about
work
he
did
for
the
ukrainian
government
jurors
acquitted
craig
after
only
about
five
hours
of
deliberations
following
a
week
trial
i
want
to
thank
the
jury
for
doing
justice
craig
said
in
a
statement
afterward
i'm
very
fortunate
to
have
the
support
of
a
loving
family
and
many
loyal
friends
who
were
steadfast
during
this
ordeal
i
will
be
forever
indebted
to
the
first-rate
team
of
lawyers
who
represented
me
in
this
case
the
case
against
craig
a
top
democratic
attorney
who
worked
for
president
bill
clinton
and
later
served
as
president
barack
obama's
white
house
counsel
spun
out
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
the
verdict
deals
a
setback
to
the
justice
department's
efforts
to
aggressively
enforce
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
the
law
which
for
years
was
loosely
enforced
requires
those
who
are
doing
political
or
public
relations
work
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
entity
to
register
the
prosecution
of
craig
was
one
of
several
fara-related
cases
that
emerged
from
mueller's
inquiry
after
hearing
some
two
weeks
of
testimony
including
from
craig
himself
the
jury
found
him
not
guilty
of
engaging
in
a
scheme
to
conceal
information
from
the
justice
department's
fara
unit
about
work
he
did
for
ukraine's
government
back
in
craig
and
his
then-law
firm
skadden
arps
slate
meagher
flom
prepared
a
report
for
the
ukrainian
government
led
by
viktor
yanukovych
about
the
trial
of
his
rival
former
prime
minister
yulia
tymoshenko
craig
and
skadden
were
commissioned
by
paul
manafort
who
was
working
for
yanukovych
at
the
time
manafort
who
earned
millions
from
his
ukraine
work
went
on
to
become
donald
trump's
campaign
adviser
but
was
later
convicted
in
a
bank
and
tax
fraud
trial
prosecuted
by
mueller's
team
the
alleged
false
statements
prosecutors
alleged
that
craig
lied
to
the
department
about
his
work
for
ukraine
to
avoid
registering
under
fara
as
a
foreign
agent
craig
was
not
in
fact
charged
with
failing
to
register
but
rather
with
withholding
information
that
he
knew
he
should
have
provided
and
providing
other
information
that
he
knew
was
false
the
case
largely
revolved
around
craig's
alleged
role
in
the
media
rollout
plan
for
the
tymoshenko
report
when
it
was
released
in
december
craig
contacted
new
york
times
reporter
david
sanger
about
the
report
and
then
hand-delivered
a
copy
of
it
to
sanger's
house
two
days
before
the
document
was
released
publicly
the
government
alleged
that
craig
did
so
at
ukraine's
behest
as
part
of
the
public
relations
effort
to
shape
the
international
perceptions
of
the
report
and
by
extension
tymoshenko's
trial
yanukovych
was
eager
to
patch
up
the
reputation
in
the
west
of
a
prosecution
that
had
been
faulted
as
an
abuse
of
power
targeting
one
of
his
political
rivals
craig
who
testified
on
his
own
behalf
at
the
trial
said
his
contacts
with
reporters
aimed
to
correct
mischaracterizations
of
the
report
he
was
not
he
said
acting
under
the
control
of
ukraine
and
was
never
an
agent
of
ukraine
one
of
craig's
attorneys
william
taylor
said
there
was
never
a
crime
and
never
evidence
of
a
crime
and
that
the
jury
made
the
only
decision
it
could
washington
lobbyists
and
the
lawyers
who
advise
them
on
fara
issues
had
been
following
craig's
case
closely
it
was
viewed
as
part
of
the
justice
department's
new
focus
on
enforcing
fara
the
interesting
question
now
is
whether
the
department
will
be
more
hesitant
to
jump
right
into
criminal
prosecutions
because
of
this
what
i
think
people
are
viewing
as
an
embarrassing
loss
for
them
said
joshua
ian
rosenstein
a
fara
expert
and
attorney
with
sandler
reiff
lamb
rosenstein
birkenstock
whatever
officials
decide
in
terms
of
prosecutions
rosenstein
said
he
thinks
it's
unlikely
the
department
will
pull
back
significantly
from
enforcing
fara
more
broadly
it's
unlikely
and
may
be
almost
impossible
for
them
to
completely
revert
to
where
they
were
before
he
said
they
may
be
more
circumspect
in
which
prosecutions
they
bring
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
aren't
going
to
be
more
aggressive
than
they
were
in
years
prior
