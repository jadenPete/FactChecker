democrats
have
been
trying
to
pressure
mitch
mcconnell
to
take
up
election
security
measures
that
passed
out
of
the
house
of
representatives
earlier
this
year
but
the
senate
majority
leader
has
shown
little
willingness
to
do
so
in
his
home
state
of
kentucky
mcconnell
has
been
dogged
by
protesters
calling
him
moscow
mitch
one
of
the
few
epithets
he
dislikes
a
billboard
in
his
hometown
of
louisville
now
urges
his
constituents
to
tell
mitch
mcconnell
stop
blocking
election
security
funding
that
billboard
is
part
of
a
ad
campaign
from
progressive
group
stand
up
america
which
is
urging
mcconnell
and
vulnerable
republican
senators
to
pass
a
bill
that
includes
million
for
states
to
replace
electronic-only
voting
machines
and
with
ones
that
use
paper
ballots
mcconnell
might
face
the
most
pressure
on
election
security
from
his
republican
colleagues
in
the
senate
some
of
whom
are
facing
tough
reelections
the
billboard
also
targets
republican
sens
joni
ernst
of
iowa
susan
collins
of
maine
cory
gardner
of
colorado
martha
mcsally
of
arizona
thom
tillis
of
north
carolina
and
david
perdue
of
georgia
but
the
pressure
is
unlikely
to
mount
in
his
home
state
which
is
largely
rural
increasingly
republican
and
very
supportive
of
president
trump
in
the
eastern
kentucky
mountain
city
of
pikeville
retired
coal
miner
and
railroad
worker
john
deskins
says
that
election
security
is
important
but
that
democrats
are
the
ones
who
have
mishandled
the
issue
what
little
bit
i
understand
about
it
is
they
put
other
implements
in
it
to
try
to
alter
exactly
what's
necessary
deskins
said
the
bill
blocked
by
mcconnell
would
have
required
all
ballots
for
federal
elections
to
be
backed
up
electronically
given
states
million
to
improve
their
election
infrastructure
and
required
that
electronic
voting
machines
be
manufactured
in
the
united
states
among
other
things
deronda
smith
a
retired
teacher
from
hazard
says
she
also
thinks
election
security
is
important
but
mcconnell's
handling
of
the
issue
won't
change
her
support
for
him
i
don't
think
it's
really
a
driving
issue
i
just
think
it's
a
very
big
safety
concern
smith
said
mcconnell
was
first
elected
to
the
senate
in
and
will
try
to
win
his
seventh
term
in
office
next
year
over
the
course
of
his
tenure
kentucky
has
turned
from
a
solidly
democratic-voting
state
to
a
republican
one
and
local
republican
voters
say
the
change
came
because
they
no
longer
related
to
democrats
at
the
federal
level
pikeville
resident
jim
hamilton
says
he
was
a
democrat
for
years
when
trump
decided
to
run
i
wasn't
a
democrat
anymore
i'm
a
republican
hamilton
said
i
couldn't
stand
anymore
this
obama
thing
he
said
obama
came
here
to
eastern
kentucky
he
shut
our
coal
mines
down
but
democrats
in
kentucky
and
across
the
country
still
hope
they
can
persuade
mcconnell
to
take
up
the
election
security
measures
partly
by
echoing
the
new
insult
he
hates
so
much

back
in
