at
a
time
when
few
women
held
prominent
roles
in

having

many
female
voices
at

she
said
liasson
said
it
wasn't
so
much
that
npr
had
a
mission
for
gender
equality
but
that
the
network's
pay
which
was
well
below
the
commercial
networks
of
the

resulted
in
a
lot
of
really
great
women

as

greatest
women
in

much
of

duck

roberts
said
in
an
interview
with
the
television
academy
foundation
don't
get
all
involved
in
the
politics
of
your
institution
or
competition
in
your
institution
just
do
your
work
and
get
it
on
the
air
and
then
people
will
see
if
you're
good
she
said
roberts
was
the
author
of
six
books
mostly
recently
capital
dames
the

war
and
the
women
of
washington
which
examined
the
role
of
powerful
women
in
the
civil
war
era
as
a
commentator
roberts
sometimes
walked
a
line
that
threatened
to
eclipse
her
role
as
a
dispassionate
journalist
in
a
february
op-ed
co-authored
with
her
husband
they
called
on
the
rational
wing
of
the
republican
party
to
stop
the
nomination
of
donald
trump
trump
is
one
of
the
least
qualified
candidates
ever
to
make
a
serious
run
for
the
presidency
roberts
and
her
husband
wrote
if
he
is
nominated
by
a
major
party
let
alone
elected
the
reputation
of
the
united
states
would
suffer
a
devastating
blow
around
the
world
in
interviews
roberts
often
said
she
might
have
run
for
public
office
herself
but
thought
she
would
spare
her
journalist
husband
the
difficulty
of
what
could
be
an
awkward
dynamic
i
have
always
felt
semi-guilty
about
it
but
i've
sort
of
assuaged
my
guilt
by
writing
about
it
and
feeling
like
i'm
educating
people
about
the
government
and
how
to
be
good
voters
and
good
citizens
roberts
told
the
washington
post
in
march
in
covering
congress
there's
plenty
of
times
when
i
felt
you
know
the
mother
line
i
don't
care
who
started
it
i'm
stopping
it
so
to
be
in
a
position
where
you
could
do
that
roberts
told
the
newspaper
it's
a
great
luxury
to
sit
on
the
outside
and
analyze
or
even
give
your
opinion
about
how
it
could
be
fixed
she
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
former
president
barack
obama
and
former
first
lady
michelle
obama
called
roberts
a
constant
over
forty
years
of
a
shifting
media
landscape
and
changing
world
informing
voters
about
the
issues
of
our
time
and
mentoring
young
journalists
every
step
of
the
way
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
said
roberts
death
was
a
great
official
loss
for
our
nation
and
a
deep
personal
loss
for
all
who
were
blessed
to
call
cokie
a
friend
cokie
roberts
was
a
trailblazer
who
forever
transformed
the
role
of
women
in
the
newsroom
