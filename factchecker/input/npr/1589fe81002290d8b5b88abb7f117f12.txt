this

a
story

very
different
congregations

each
found
themselves
caught
up
in

racist
rhetoric

a
welcome

on
the
way
into
town
reads
historic
appomattox
where
our
nation
reunited
but
here
in
appomattox
where
the
civil
war
ended
more
than
years
ago
there
are
still
reminders
of
division
not
far
away
a
sign
posted
in
front
of
friendship
baptist
church
reads
america
love
it
or
leave
it
pastor
earnie
lucas
said
he
posted
that
message
on
his
church
sign
several
weeks
ago
it
was
around
the
same
time
that
president
trump
tweeted
an
attack
on
four
democratic
members
of
congress
all
women
of
color
saying
they
should
go
back
and
help
fix
the
totally
broken
and
crime
infested
places
from
which
they
came
lucas
is
white
and
has
been
a
pastor
in
this
community
for
decades
he
defends
his
sign
and
expresses
anger
about
the
response
it
has
received
online
and
in
news
reports
don't
talk
to
me
about
that
flag
out
yonder
or
that
sign
out
yonder
he
thundered
from
the
pulpit
this
is
america
and
i
love
america
lucas
asks
if
anyone
in
the
small
all-white
congregation
is
from
yankee
land
no
one
raises
their
hand
the
letters
that
came
from
north
of
the
mason-dixon
line
i
am
sorry
to
say
those
folk
don't
know
how
to
talk
lucas
said
you're
talking
about
some
vile
wretched
language
and
where
they
told
me
to
go
and
how
long
to
stay
they
were
filthy
in
their
conversation
lucas
said
he
has
gotten
threats
of
violence
even
death
since
putting
up
the
sign
he
also
got
letters
of
support
including
some
donations
from
around
the
country
local
media
initially
reported
that
several
members
of
the
congregation
had
staged
a
walkout
in
protest
or
out
of
fear
of
the
backlash
but
last
weekend
lucas
said
most
of
the
regulars
had
returned
i
had
no
ill
intent
against
anyone
around
here
or
in
the
state
of
virginia
lucas
said
i
was
talking
about
people
who
have
come
over
here
illegally
and
want
to
tear
the
place
up
during
the
service
he
mentioned
the
recent
mass
shooting
in
el
paso
texas
that
left
people
dead
but
afterward
he
said
he
doesn't
believe
news
reports
that
the
white
shooter
was
targeting
latinos
lucas
also
said
he
does
not
believe
analyses
suggesting
that
undocumented
immigrants
are
less
likely
to
commit
violent
crimes
than
others
living
in
the
united
states
lucas
doesn't
see
his
words
or
the
president's
as
racist
i
think
this
idea
of
racism
has
been
blown
out
of
proportion
lucas
said
i
really
do
we've
got
some
sorry
people
black
and
white
but
i
don't
pay
any
attention
to
that
if
a
man
comes
to
me
and
behaves
himself
we
get
along
good
together
i'll
go
to
bat
for
him
any
way
i
can
i
don't
want
any
muslims
in
america

cook
said
she
agrees
with
the
message
on
her
church

and
with
her

she
said
trump
was
right
to
criticize
the
four

two

in

is
another

baptist
church
the
congregation
is
predominantly
black
and
the
members
are
experiencing
this
moment
very
differently
from
the
friendship
baptist
congregants
in
appomattox
sitting
in
his
church
office
pastor
norwood
carson
said
his
secretary
has
received
angry
calls
from
people
confused
about
their
name
we
gave
a
standard
response
to
all
of
them
carson
said
you
are
calling
the
friendship
baptist
church
of
hopewell
the
church
that
loves
god
loves
others
and
serves
the
community
we
are
not
that
church
that
says
america
love
it
or
leave
it
carson
said
the
meaning
of
that
sign
is
clear
obviously
it's
a
racist
statement
he
said
but
to
find
out
it
came
from
a
church
just
really
took
me
for
a
loop
carson
said
he'd
like
to
talk
to
pastor
lucas
at
friendship
baptist
in
appomattox
and
try
to
understand
more
about
what
motivated
that
sign
lucas
said
he's
open

conversation
