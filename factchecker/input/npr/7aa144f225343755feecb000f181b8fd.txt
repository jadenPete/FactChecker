democratic

slammed
the

their

lose
more
than
million
in

i'm
deeply
concerned
about
president
trump's
plan
to
pull
funding
from
critical
national
security
projects
including
millions
of
dollars
from
important
projects
in
virginia
so
he
can
build
his
border
wall
kaine
said
the
well-being
of
american
troops
is
the
core
responsibility
of
every
commander
in
the
military
yet
the
commander
in
chief
is
shirking
that
duty
so
he
can
advance
his
own
political
agenda
the
comments
come
a
day
after
the
pentagon
began
calling
congressional
leaders
to
alert
them
of
the
overall

to
begin
canceling
billion
in

warner
said
in
a
written
statement
taking
money
away
from
our
military
including
funding
to
support
critical
projects
here
in

will
mean
we
are
less

a

building

huachuca
will
lose
million
in
project
funds
in

statement
mcsally
downplayed
the
loss
saying
it
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
overall
billion
and
needed
for
national
security
also
the
money
can
be
backfilled
by
a
provision
in
the
proposed
senate
version
of
the
defense
bill
that
aims
to
backfill
the
billion
through
the
fiscal
year
budget
however
that

provision
isn't
in

both

negotiate
a
final

in

we
need
to
secure
our
border
and
protect
our
military
we
can
and
should
do
both
mcsally
said
this
one
project
at
fort
huachuca
was
already
delayed
because
of
ongoing
environmental
cleanup
that
is
taking
longer

expected
arizona
