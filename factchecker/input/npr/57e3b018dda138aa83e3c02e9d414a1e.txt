after

the
details

of
u.s.
officials
sending
mixed
signals
about
how
bahamians
especially
those
traveling
by
boat
will
be
allowed
into
the
u.s.
bahamians
arriving

visa
the

said
visa
waivers
could
be
granted

and
get
pre-clearance
travelers

otherwise
qualify
for

program
and
who
travel

preclearance
facility
in
freeport
or

visitor's

freeport
airport
was
devastated
by
the
hurricane
monday
afternoon
acting
customs
and
border
protection
commissioner
mark
morgan
said
his
agency
has
processed
thousands
of
folks
from
two
cruise
ships
as
well
as
aircraft
speaking
at
the
white
house
morgan
admitted
there
has
been
some
confusion
surrounding
the
process
by
which
bahamian
refugees
are
being
allowed
into
the
country
including
passengers
on
a
ferry
boat
who
said
they
were
turned
away
sunday
because
they
lacked
travel
visas
morgan
said
border
patrol
agents
will
accept
anyone
on
humanitarian
reasons
that
needs
to
come
here
whether
they
have
proper
travel
documents
or
not
we've
already
processed
people
that
have
travel
documents
and
don't
have
travel
documents
he
said
this
is
a
humanitarian
mission
morgan
said
if
your
life
is
in
jeopardy
and
you're
in
the
bahamas
and
you
want
to
get
to
the
united
states
you're
going
to
be
allowed
to
come
to
the
united
states
he
said
there
would
still
be
some
vetting
to
make
sure
that
we're
not
letting
dangerous
people
in
taking
advantage
of
this
acting
commissioner

morgan
speaks
during
a
briefing
at
the
white
house
on
monday
but
a
few
hours
later
president
trump
appeared
to
contradict
morgan
we
have
to
be
very
careful
trump
told
reporters
monday
afternoon
everybody
needs
totally
proper
documentation
morgan
said
people
found
to
have
long
criminal
records
will
be
turned
over
to
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
we're
not
letting
dangerous
people
in
he
said
the
administration
has
not
yet
decided
whether
to
grant
the
bahamians
who
enter
the
u.s.
temporary
protected
status
allowing
them
to
stay
in
the
country
trump
said
we're
talking
to
a
lot
of
people
about
that
earlier
morgan
said
it
will
depend
on
how
long
it
takes
to
rebuild
the
islands
we
would
not
support
returning
them
to
a
place
where
its
not
safe
for
them
to
be
he
said
florida's
two
republican
senators
marco
rubio
and
rick
scott
have
asked
the
trump
administration
to
waive
any
visa
requirements
for
residents
of
the
bahamas
who
wish
to
enter
the
u.s.
in
a
sept
letter
to
the
president
they
wrote
this
will
allow
citizens
of
the
bahamas
who
have
low
visa
overstay
rates
to
stay
with
family
in
the
united
states
while
the
country
rebuilds
in
the
wake
of
hurricane
dorian's
unprecedented
destruction
under
a
standing
customs
and
border
protection
policy
some
bahamians
with
a
passport
and
police
certification
who
don't
have
a
criminal
record
can
travel
to
the
u.s.
without
a
visa
if
they
are
pre-cleared
at
the
airport
