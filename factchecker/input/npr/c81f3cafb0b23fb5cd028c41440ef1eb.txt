says

need
to
set
rules
for
big

companies
almost
no
technology
has
gone
so
entirely
unregulated
for
so
long
as

he
says
regulate
us
that's
the
unexpected
message
from
one
of
the
country's
leading
tech
executives
microsoft
president
brad
smith
argues
that
governments
need
to
put
some
guardrails
around
engineers
and
the
tech
titans
they
serve
if
public
leaders
don't
he
says
the
internet
giants
will
cannibalize
the
very
fabric
of
this
country
we
need
to
work
together
we
need
to
work
with
governments
to
protect
frankly
something
that
is
far
more
important
than
technology
democracy
it
was
here
before
us
it
needs
to
be
here
and
healthy
after
us
smith
says
smith
has
co-authored
with
carol
ann
browne
tools
and
weapons
the
promise
and
the
peril
of
the
digital
age
the
title
reflects
a
simple
fact
about
how
any
technology
and
digital
tech
in
particular
works
it
can
be
a
tool
or
a
weapon
much
like
a
knife
microsoft
is
not
in
the
crosshairs
right
now
but
when
it
was
back
in
the
s
smith
was
the
man
repeating
that
well-worn
refrain
about
how
regulation
kills
innovation
i
look
at
the
things
that
we
said
i
look
at
the
things
i
said
years
ago
he
says
there
were
many
things
that
we
got
wrong
according
to
smith
the
threat
that
microsoft
posed
during
its
protracted
antitrust
case
was
economic
today
the
tech
giants
whose
tools
have
been
used
to
interfere
in
fair
and
free
elections
are
posing
a
much
bigger
threat
to
the
political
stability
of
many
countries
including
the
u.s.
smith
has
proposals
that
are
not
popular
in
silicon
valley
for
one
he
argues
it's
time
to
reform
the
u.s.
law
that
says
internet
platforms
are
not
liable
for
just
about
any
of
the
content
running
through
their
pipes
hate
speech
death
threats
and
ads
for
counterfeit
goods
or
illegal
guns
that
law
has
enabled
microsoft's
competitors
amazon
facebook
and
google
and
its
subsidiary
youtube
to
grow
at
breakneck
speed
almost
no
technology
has
gone
so
entirely
unregulated
for
so
long
as
digital
technology
smith
says
skeptics
say
smith's
rhetoric
masks
an
agenda
to
keep
microsoft
on
top
a
tough
law
making
internet
platforms
accountable
for
content
poses
a
greater
threat
to
the
competition
than
to
microsoft
and
calling
for
regulation
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
strongest
regulation
earlier
this
year
in
its
home
state
of
washington
microsoft
pushed
back
on
a
facial
recognition
bill
that
protected
civil
rights
in
favor
of
a
less
restrictive
bill
and
other
tech
chiefs
including
facebook's
mark
zuckerberg
have
said
there's
a
need
for
some
regulation
but
smith
goes
further
and
deeper
than
his
peers
by
arguing
that
governments
need
to
probe
the
fundamentals
of
the
data
economy
he
poses
these
questions
where
do
our
data
go
who
gets
to
call
the
shots
on
how
our
data
get
used
the
few
companies
microsoft
included
that
have
collected
the
informaton
i
worry
that
if
all
of
the
data
on
which
the
world
relies
is
in
the
hands
of
a
small
number
of
tech
companies
you're
going
to
see
a
massive
transfer
of
economic
wealth
he
says
this
week
nearly
every
state
attorney
general
in
the
u.s.
joined
an
antitrust
probe
into
google
last
week
nine
attorneys
general
launched
an
investigation
of
facebook
it
will
be
years
before
a
court
ruling
if
any
lands
smith
encourages
his
fellow
tech
leaders
to
look
for
places
where
they
can
compromise
he
is
the
one
who
pushed
bill
gates
and
microsoft
to
enter
a
settlement
which
was
hard
emotionally
there
were
days
when
people
would
say
why
are
you
such
a
wimp
smith
recalls
the
answer
in
my
view
was
because
it
was
the
wrong
fight
to
fight
and
it
often
takes
more
courage
to
compromise
than
it
does
to
keep
fighting
that
sounds
like
geopolitical
business
and
marriage
advice
maybe
smith
has
another
book

him
