commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
is
under
the
microscope
for
reportedly
pressuring
government
scientists
to
back
president
trump
over
a
misleading
tweet
about
hurricane
dorian
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
is
under
the
microscope
again
amid
fresh
allegations
of
meddling
with
a
government
scientific
agency
the
latest
storm
to
engulf
the
secretary
began
sept
when
weather
forecasters
in
birmingham
ala
issued
a
tweet
saying
hurricane
dorian
posed
no
threat
to
their
state
we
were
reacting
to
the
calls
that
were
coming
into
our
office
and
people
were
actually
frightened
said
kevin
laws
science
officer
for
the
national
weather
service
in
birmingham
they
were
wanting
to
cancel
surgeries
and
they
were
wanting
to
go
pick
up
elderly
parents
at
the
coastline
because
they
were
genuinely
scared
and
we
felt
like
we
needed
to
make
a
statement
on
where
this
storm
was
going
to
go
and
to
reassure
our
people
laws
and
his
colleagues
learned
only
later
what
sparked
those
anxious
phone
calls
a
tweet
from
president
trump
mistakenly
including
alabama
on
a
list
of
states
that
could
be
hard
hit
by
the
storm
for
days
trump
stubbornly
insisted
he
was
right
about
the
hurricane's
path
giving
fodder
to
late-night
comics
when
he
showed
off
a
map
that
had
been
clumsily
doctored
with
a
sharpie
but
the
story
took
a
more
serious
turn
last
friday
when
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
the
federal
agency
that
includes
the
national
weather
service
issued
an
unsigned
statement
defending
the
president's
tweet
and
chastising
the
birmingham
forecasters
who
contradicted
it
according
to
the
new
york
times
noaa's
statement
followed
political
pressure
from
the
commerce
secretary
who
oversees
the
weather
agency
and
threatened
to
fire
noaa
officials
if
they
failed
to
back
up
the
president
this
is
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back
said
rep
don
beyer
d-va
who
called
for
ross
to
resign
threatening
to
fire
senior
noaa
appointees
if
they
didn't
prop
up
trump's
false
weather
claims
it's
just
one
bridge
too
far
a
commerce
department
spokesman
denied
the
times
report
saying
ross
didn't
threaten
to
fire
anyone
over
the
dueling
hurricane
statements
secretary
ross
has
never
stopped
advocating
for
the
american
people
the
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
but
the
episode
has
brought
renewed
attention
to
ross
history
of
interfering
with
government
scientists
it's
part
of
a
pattern
of
deemphasizing
science
and
facts
and
the
truth
in
order
to
play
some
often
naive
or
silly
political
agenda
said
beyer
who
serves
on
the
house
committee
on
science
space
and
technology
the
committee's
chairwoman
rep
eddie
bernice
johnson
d-texas
endorsed
an
investigation
of
the
noaa
statement
by
the
commerce
department's
inspector
general
ross
who
also
oversees
the
census
bureau
previously
bucked
scientific
experts
there
when
he
tried
to
include
a
citizenship
question
on
the
census
despite
warnings
that
it
would
jeopardize
an
accurate
head
count
it
certainly
introduces
uncertainties
about
the
scientific
integrity
of
our
national
statistics
when
you
see
political
interference
with
the
mission
of
these
agencies
said
john
thompson
who
directed
the
bureau
from
to
the
supreme
court
ultimately
blocked
the
citizenship
question
in
his
ruling
chief
justice
john
roberts
suggested
that
the
question
would
have
been
allowed
if
ross
had
not
misrepresented
his
motives
ross
claimed
he
was
acting
on
a
request
from
the
justice
department
but
roberts
concluded
that
this
was
a
mere
pretext
the
trump
administration
has
also
been
quietly
purging
information
about
climate
change
from
government
websites
and
replacing
independent
scientific
advisers
with
industry
insiders
complaints
about
the
scientific
integrity
of
government
agencies
can
often
seem
esoteric
but
a
battle
over
the
national
weather
service
helps
bring
it
home
everyone
knows
their
local
tv
meteorologist
and
understands
that
they
get
information
directly
from
the
government
said
michael
halpern
of
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
the
air
pollution
scientists
who
work
for
epa
are
a
little
bit
more
behind
the
scenes
but
their
work
is
just
as
critical
to
protecting
the
public
ross
hasn't
tried
to
skew
only
government
measurements
he
has
also
tried
to
skew
measures
of
his
own
wealth
for
years
forbes
magazine
included
ross
on
its
list
of
the
richest
americans
estimating
his
fortune
at
billion
in
but
once
he
joined
the
administration
financial
disclosures
revealed
ross
was
really
worth
only
a
fraction
of
that
we
estimate
that
he
is
worth
about
million
said
forbes
senior
editor
dan
alexander
and
what's
sad
somebody
who
has
been
so
successful
and
is
so
wealthy
still
for
him
it
wasn't
enough
he
wanted
to
be
seen
as
richer
he
wanted
people
to
think
he
was
a
billionaire
and
he
just
never
was
in
a
story
about
ross
exaggerated
claims
of
wealth
alexander
quoted
longtime
co-workers
about
the
secretary's
habit
of
bending
the
truth
at
this
point
people
just
don't
trust
him
alexander
said
tuesday
as
the
noaa
controversy
was
making
headlines
so
it
wasn't
that
much
of
a
surprise
to
see
that
wilbur
was
apparently
helping
cover
up
for
misinformation
about
that
by
the
time
dorian's
winds
reached
hurricane
strength
ross
credibility
was
in
danger
even
if
the
people
of
alabama
were
not
