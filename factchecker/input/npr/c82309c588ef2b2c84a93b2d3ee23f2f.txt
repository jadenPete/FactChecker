president
trump
seen

to
reporters
at
the
white
house
on
monday
has
fired
his
national
security
adviser
with
john
bolton
gone
what
does
that
mean
for
afghanistan
peace
talks
and
other
major
foreign
policy
president
trump
spiked
the
peace
negotiations
for
a
war
he's
desperate
to
end
and
sacked
the
national
security
adviser
who
shaped
much
of
his
foreign
policy
in
asia
and
the
middle
east
where
does
the
trump
administration's
foreign
policy
go
from
here
until
saturday
one
path
at
least
appeared
clear
washington
was
inching
closer
to
some
kind
of
agreement
with
the
taliban
to
end
the
year
conflict
in
afghanistan
meanwhile
though
his
administration
was
taking
a
tough
official
line
against
iran
venezuela
north
korea
and
russia
it
was
sometimes
accompanied
by
a
soft
semiofficial
line
taken
by
trump
himself
then
trump
announced
saturday
he
was
canceling
a
summit
he'd
planned
to
convene
secretly
at
camp
david
with
afghan
government
and
taliban
leaders
and
he
proclaimed
monday
that
he
considered
peace
talks
to
be
dead
that
night
trump
talked
with
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
in
an
exchange
that
bolton
said
resulted
in
him
offering
his
resignation
trump
says
he
asked
bolton
to
quit
effect
on
policy
bolton
became
the
latest
top
official
to
be
terminated
in
a
presidential
tweet
over
a
disagreement
with
the
principal
with
uncertain
consequences
for
the
conduct
of
a
major
american
policy
in
the
past
these
kinds
of
resignations
have
resulted
in
pyrrhic
victories
for
those
involved
when
then-defense
secretary
jim
mattis
and
then-envoy
brett
mcgurk
resigned
at
the
end
of
rather
than
go
along
with
trump's
planned
withdrawal
from
syria
they
appeared
to
stay
the
administration's
hand
from
the
full
military
pullout
trump
had
contemplated
one
question
now
is
how
long
bolton's
policy
without
bolton
himself
will
endure
within
the
administration
trump
has
desired
for
years
to
cut
bait
on
the
war
in
afghanistan
and
he
seems
unlikely
to
leave
peace
talks
dormant
for
long
the
special
envoy
who's
been
carrying
on
the
negotiations
with
the
taliban
zalmay
khalilzad
appears
to
be
staying
on
in
his
administration
job
factors
beyond
bolton
but
the
timing
of
when
talks
could
resume
and
when
they
might
show
results
is
important
and
all
that
has
been
cast
into
doubt
one
reason
is
afghanistan's
presidential
election
scheduled
for
this
month
president
ashraf
ghani
is
considered
a
favorite
to
secure
another
term
but
the
taliban
accuse
his
government
of
being
stooges
for
the
americans
the
closer
that
election
comes
the
likelier
there
could
be
violence
that
further
delays
the
resumption
of
negotiations
a
taliban
attack
that
resulted
in
the
death
of
an
american
service
member
was
the
reason
trump
gave
for
abrogating
negotiations
although
they
may
have
begun
to
founder
before
his
surprise
announcement
on
saturday
another
factor
is
the
american
presidential
election
next
year
trump
supports
withdrawing
thousands
of
u.s.
troops
from
afghanistan
he
has
long
been
dubious
of
the
establishment
consensus
on
how
to
preserve
stability
there
and
the
objections
of
hawks
who
say
washington
must
persevere
until
a
final
victory
trump
went
down
that
route
with
mattis
for
a
time
he
agreed
to
an
increase
in
the
u.s.
military
presence
in
afghanistan
curtailed
much
of
the
public
reporting
about
the
conflict
and
kiboshed
any
talk
about
timetables
for
the
end
of
the
war
then
the
president
apparently
ran
out
of
patience
and
he
has
made
clear
he
doesn't
care
for
american
deployments
to
continue
in
their
current
form
any
longer
than
he
can
manage
bolton's
ouster
removes
an
internal
skeptic
about
that
approach
and
whoever
trump
names
as
his
replacement
will
need
to
be
on
board
the
current
program
but
with
the
diplomatic
track
toward
an
endgame
in
afghanistan
derailed
there's
also
no
telling
what
the
next
phase
could
look
like
also
unresolved
iran
north
korea
bolton's
defenestration
also
scrambles
the
outlook
for
other
tough
areas
of
foreign
and
national
security
policy
bolton
helped
write
the
playbook
that
trump
and
his
advisers
used
to
abrogate
america's
participation
in
the
iran
nuclear
deal
negotiated
by
then-president
barack
obama
what
followed
was
the
campaign
of
maximum
pressure
on
tehran
that
brought
it
to
the
brink
of
a
flashpoint
with
the
u.s.
and
other
world
powers
over
oil
and
other
sanctions
now
trump
is
airing
his
willingness
to
talk
with
iran
he
gave
his
assent
to
some
initial
forays
by
france's
president
emmanuel
macron
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
repeated
on
tuesday
that
trump
is
prepared
to
meet
with
iran's
president
with
no
preconditions
with
bolton
gone
is
that
now
more
likely
another
unresolved
line
of
effort
is
that
toward
north
korea
trump
loves
kvelling
about
the
warm
relationship
he
says
he's
developed
with
strongman
kim
jong
un
including
through
the
beautiful
letters
that
arrive
at
the
white
house
from
pyongyang
that
relationship
so
far
hasn't
yielded
a
lasting
agreement
in
which
north
korea
would
dismantle
its
nuclear
weapons
program
in
exchange
for
sanctions
relief
or
other
normalization
of
its
relationship
with
the
world
one
reason
it
hasn't
was
bolton
who
held
out
for
more
concessions
from
the
north
kim's
regime
criticized
both
him
and
trump's
most
enduring
foreign
policy
lieutenant
pompeo
at
one
point
asking
for
the
secretary
of
state
to
be
replaced
as
their
interlocutor
on
the
american
side
in
order
to
continue
talks
trump
has
said
in
so
many
words
that
everything
is
fine
with
north
korea
the
regime's
periodic
regional
missile
tests
don't
bother
him
so
long
as
it
doesn't
fire
weapons
that
can
threaten
the
united
states
or
test
another
nuclear
weapon
with
bolton
gone
is
trump
that
much
likelier
to
agree
to
another
summit
with
kim
and
then
to
some
kind
of
new
agreement
with
north
korea
u.s.
intelligence
officials
have
said
they
don't
believe
kim
would
ever
give
up
his
strategic
weapons
program
because
he
views
it
as
essential
to
his
regime's
survival
excellent
news
some
arms
control
advocates
however
hailed
bolton's
departure
because
they
said
it
means
improved
odds
for
new
treaties
with
russia
the
united
states
has
let
one
major
nuclear
agreement
lapse
with
russia
the
intermediate
nuclear
forces
treaty
and
the
new
start
agreement
is
up
for
negotiation
in
if
bolton's
departure
makes
it
likelier
that
trump
would
agree
to
extend
it
that's
excellent
news
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
said
on
tuesday
for
every
issue
a
take
but
the
bottom
line
was
expressed
by
pompeo
on
tuesday
at
a
white
house
briefing
that
originally
was
to
have
included
bolton
the
secretary
of
state
told
reporters
that
the
only
person
who
determines
who
works
for
trump
and
what
that
means
for
the
policy
of
the
united
states
is
trump
