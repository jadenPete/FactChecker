suggested
a

law
is
needed
to
be
able
to
indict
a
sitting
president
for
potential
lawbreaking
while
in
office
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
npr
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
says
she
has
not
changed
her
mind
on
pursuing
impeachment
but
is
ready
to
change
the
law
to
restrain
presidential
power
and
make
it
clear
that
a
sitting
president
can
in
fact
be
indicted
i
do
think
that
we
will
have
to
pass
some
laws
that
will
have
clarity
for
future
presidents
a
president
should
be
indicted
if
he's
committed
a
wrongdoing
any
president
there
is
nothing
anyplace
that
says
the
president
should
not
be
indicted
pelosi
told
all
things
considered
host
ari
shapiro
and
npr
congressional
correspondent
susan
davis
on
friday
that's
something
cooked
up
by
the
president's
lawyers
that's
what
that
is
but
so
that
people
will
feel
ok
well
if
he
if
he
does
something
wrong
he
should
be
able
to
be
indicted
the
california
democrat
said
that
while
it
is
justice
department
protocol
not
to
pursue
any
charges
against
an
incumbent
the
reason
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
said
he
couldn't
charge
president
trump
with
a
crime
no
matter
the
outcome
of
his
report
that
should
be
changed
the
founders
could
never
suspect
that
a
president
would
be
so
abusive
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
the
separation
of
powers
would
be
irrelevant
to
him
and
that
he
would
continue
any
president
would
continue
to
withhold
facts
from
the
congress
which
are
part
of
the
constitutional
right
of
inquiry
pelosi
said
the
constitutional
recourse
for
a
lawbreaking
president
per
the
constitution
is
impeachment
article
ii
section
instructs
that
the
president
shall
be
removed
from
office
on
impeachment
for
and
conviction
of
treason
bribery
or
other
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
but
despite
the
growing
chants
among
democrats
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
in
the
house
pelosi
has
remained
reluctant
about
recourse
she
fears
it
could
alienate
swing
voters
ahead
of
next
year's
elections
and
imperil
moderate
democrats
who
were
critical
to
her
party's
taking
back
the
house
last
november
pelosi
did
not
shift
her
position
on
impeachment
and
said
congress
would
continue
to
follow
the
facts
and
the
law
the
speaker
also
said
congress
should
also
clarify
the
limits
of
when
a
president
can
invoke
a
national
emergency
the
president
should
not
be
able
to
interpret
the
national
security
act
as
something
that
gives
him
free
rein
to
do
anything
he
wants
by
his
personal
declaration
that
something
is
an
emergency
she
said
pressure
could
be
ramped
up
on
pelosi
and
democrats
to
act
further
amid
reports
that
trump
had
an
improper
conversation
with
a
foreign
leader
which
a
whistleblower
within
the
intelligence
community
then
reported
the
conversation
is
reported
to
have
been
urging
ukraine
to
look
into
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
current
democratic
presidential
front-runner
who
could
be
trump's
foe
and
his
son
hunter
biden
trump
has
said
the
conversation
was
totally
appropriate
pelosi
called
the
whistleblower's
complaint
very
alarming
and
said
this
is
in
a
different
class
in
terms
of
trump's
behavior
this
case
has
a
national
security
piece
to
it
that
is
very
alarming
it
is
very
alarming
because
the
inspector
general
is
appointed
by
president
trump
she
said
the
law
is
clear
that
the
information
must
be
submitted
to
the
intelligence
committees
in
congress
right
now
they
are
breaking
the
law
by
not
providing
that
information
she
said
in
a
statement
released
after
the
npr
interview
pelosi
went
even
further
saying
the
reports
raise
grave
urgent
concerns
for
our
national
security
and
that
the
president
and
his
administration
must
conduct
our
national
security
and
foreign
policy
in
the
best
interest
of
the
american
people
not
the
president's
personal
interest
if
the
president
has
done
what
has
been
alleged
she
said
then
he
is
stepping
into
a
dangerous
minefield
with
serious
repercussions
for
his
administration
and
our
democracy
