president

has
ordered
that
the
number
of
refugees
allowed
to
resettle
in
the

in
the

be
cut
nearly
in
half
to
down
from
the
administration's
previous
refugee
ceiling
of
the
limit
represents
the
lowest
number
of
refugees
seeking
protection
from
violence
or
political
persecution
allowed
into
the
country
since
the
modern
refugee
program
was
established
in
the
new
cap
which
marks
the
third
time
the
trump
administration
has
dwindled
the
refugee
limit
would
also
be
a
more
than
decline
compared
with
the
last
year
of
the
obama
administration
when
the
u.s.
allowed
up
to
refugees
who
were
fleeing
war
persecution
and
poverty
to
resettle
in
america
trump
officials
also
announced
that
this
year
cities
and
states
will
have
to
provide
written
consent
before
accepting
foreigners
fleeing
persecution
allowing
localities
to
opt
out
of
accepting
refugees
the
administration
argues
it
needs
to
devote
its
energy
to
dealing
with
a
humanitarian
and
security
crisis
along
the
southern
border
where
tens
of
thousands
of
asylum-seekers
are
arriving
every
month
according
to
senior
administration
officials
who
briefed
reporters
on
thursday
the
u.s.
will
accept
up
to
people
fleeing
religious
persecution
a
maximum
of
iraqis
who
have
assisted
the
u.s.
military
and
no
more
than
people
from
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
an
additional
migrants
seeking
family
reunification
and
who
have
already
been
cleared
for
resettlement
could
be
accepted
the
international
refugee
assistance
project's
betsy
fisher
called
the
new
limits
a
shockingly
low
refugee
admissions
goal
warning
that
the
policy
will
all
but
ensure
that
people
in
need
of
safety
will
be
left
in
dangerous
conditions
but
senior
administration
officials
defended
the
action
by
arguing
that
the
focus
needs
to
be
on
protecting
those
already
in
the
u.s.
at
the
core
of
the
trump
administration's
foreign
policy
is
a
commitment
to
make
decisions
based
on
reality
not
wishes
the
state
department
said
in
a
statement
announcing
the
new
policy
administration
officials
also
cited
the
nearly
million
backlogged
cases
in
immigration
courts
in
the
u.s.
many
of
which
are
pending
asylum
cases
the
current
burdens
on
the
u.s.
immigration
system
must
be
alleviated
before
it
is
again
possible
to
resettle
large
number
of
refugees
the
administration
said
in
a
statement
prioritizing
the
humanitarian
protection
cases
of
those
already
in
our
country
is
simply
a
matter
of
fairness
and
common
sense
immigration
rights
advocates
swiftly
criticized
the
new
asylum
limit
daryl
grisgraber
of
oxfam
america
called
the
announcement
immoral
and
un-american
in
their
senseless
quest
to
keep
foreigners
out
this
administration
proves
they
are
willing
to
abandon
our
nation's
founding
principles
and
outright
reject
human
rights
grisgraber
said
separately
trump
issued
an
executive
order
to
allow
states
and
localities
to
refuse
the
resettlement
of
refugees
in
their
communities
which
is
expected
to
face
challenges
in
court
ryan
mace
with
amnesty
international
usa
slammed
both
moves
to
cut
the
number
of
refugees
the
u.s.
will
accept
to
this
low
of
a
number
reflects
nothing
more
than
this
administration's
attempts
to
further
hate
division
and
prejudice
in
a
country
that
once
valued
dignity
equality
and
fairness
in
justifying
the
order
giving
local
governments
the
ability
to
turn
away
people
seeking
asylum
one
senior
administration
official
said
state
and
local
officials
are
best
positioned
to
know
the
resources
and
capacities
that
have
to
devote
to
resettlement
so
the
administration
wants
to
provide
for
closer
coordination
with
them
and
a
more
clearly
defined
role
for
them
in
the
process
of
selecting
sites
for
initial
resettlement
the
official
said
