she
says
to
some
republican
sen
john
mccain
embodied
principles
of
a
bygone
washington
he
sought
common
ground
he
reached
across
the
political
divide
he
had
close
friendships
with
democrats
his
wife
cindy
mccain
would
like
to
try
to
get
back
to
those
days
so
to
mark
a
year
since
her
husband
died
of
brain
cancer
she
is
encouraging
americans
to
be
more
civil
we're
missing
john's
voice
of
reason
right
now
in
so
many
ways
mccain
tells
npr's
david
greene
in
politics
and
in
life
the
climate
has
grown
especially
nasty
since
john
mccain
died
and
so
his
wife
says
to
honor
his
legacy
it
felt
to
me
that
the
right
thing
to
do
was
to
encourage
people
to
perform
acts
of
civility
during
the
last
week
of
august
and
then
post
about
them
on
social
media
agree
to
disagree
but
just
be
civil
about
it
she
says
john
mccain
was
born
on
aug
and
died
on
aug
wrapped
in
that
legacy
is
also
his
choice
of
sarah
palin
as
his
running
mate
in
the
presidential
election
which
he
lost
to
barack
obama
and
joe
biden
the
choice
to
pick
palin
was
criticized
as
a
turning
point
for
the
republican
party
one
that
set
it
on
the
path
of
as
new
york
times
columnist
david
brooks
put
it
anti-intellectualism
and
disrespect
for
facts
cindy
mccain
disagrees
i
know
the
party
our
party
like
the
democratic
party
is
a
good
party
we
just
disagree
she
says
there's
problems
on
both
sides

john
mccain's
legacy
has
itself
become
an
example
of
the
tenor
change
in
washington
the
celebrated
vietnam
war
veteran
and
former
prisoner
of
war
came
under
attack
in
when
donald
trump
then
a
candidate
campaigning
for
the
presidency
said
that
mccain
was
a
war
hero
because
he
was
captured
and
that
trump
liked
people
that
weren't
captured
trump's
criticisms
intensified
after
mccain
voted
against
a
republican
plan
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
in
seven
months
after
mccain
died
trump
said
he
was
never
a
fan
of
john
mccain
and
i
never
will
be
cindy
mccain
says
that
her
husband
taught
her
a
lot
about
how
to
respond
to
such
attacks
it's
much
easier
to
be
calm
and
work
through
this
than
it
is
to
get
angry
anger
doesn't
help
anything
she
says
it
also
doesn't
help
my
husband's
legacy
either
because
that's
not
what
he
stood
for
mccain
tells
npr
she
thinks
the
parties
can
get
back
their
more
civil
days
i
think
it's
going
to
take
some
time
there's
a
lot
of
healing
to
be
done
but
i
think
we
can
do
it
