manufacturers
in
a
variety
of
countries
including
indonesia
india
and
sri
lanka
a
lot
of
american
companies
that
make
or
buy
products
in
china
are
starting
to
rethink
that
as
a
new
round
of
tariffs
takes
effect
this
weekend
but
robert
d'loren
doesn't
have
to
worry
as
ceo
of
the
xcel
brands
clothing
company
he
began
moving
production
out
of
china
some
time
ago
you
never
want
to
have
all
your
eggs
in
one
basket
d'loren
said
china
was
easy
in
retrospect
probably
if
you
had
of
your
production
in
china
that
wasn't
good
risk-management
planning
d'loren
who
sells
clothing
under
the
isaac
mizrahi
and
halston
labels
among
others
once
manufactured
of
his
company's
clothes
in
china
today
that's
down
to
about
a
byproduct
of
d'loren's
effort
to
find
faster
more
flexible
suppliers
that
can
jump
on
fashion
trends
and
turn
out
clothes
in
as
little
as
six
weeks
sometimes
there
are
things
that
by
design
and
by
luck
you
do
that
serve
you
well
d'loren
said
xcel
now
manufacturers
in
a
variety
of
countries
including
indonesia
india
and
sri
lanka
and
it's
exploring
production
in
central
and
south
america
but
building
that
flexible
network
wasn't
easy
clothes
from
the
new
factories
didn't
fit
right
at
first
or
the
fabric
wasn't
what
d'loren
expected
it
took
us
five
deliveries
to
get
it
right
he
said
everything
that
could
go
wrong
did
go
wrong
many
companies
are
now
going
through
a
similar
process
of
trial
and
error
as
they
look
for
ways
to
avoid
the
president's
tariffs
the
truth
is
that
the
trade
war
is
a
little
bit
of
a
wake-up
call
for
many
companies
said
gerry
mattios
a
singapore-based
vice
president
with
bain
company
consultants
he
says
rising
labor
costs
in
china
were
already
causing
some
companies
to
look
elsewhere
for
suppliers
and
the
trump
tariffs
have
accelerated
that
but
other
countries
will
need
a
lot
of
investment
to
match
the
expert
manufacturing
base
and
robust
shipping
network
that
china
has
built
over
the
past
two
decades
a
survey
by
the
american
chamber
of
commerce
in
china
says
most
companies
that
do
relocate
look
to
southeast
asia
vietnam's
exports
to
the
u.s.
jumped
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
mexico
is
another
popular
destination
for
companies
shifting
away
from
china
roberto
durazo
works
for
a
company
called
ivemsa
that
helps
manufacturers
set
up
shop
in
mexico
he
held
three
conference
calls
with
potential
clients
in
a
single
day
this
week
but
for
now
he
says
most
companies
are
keeping
their
options
open
not
many
of
them
are
pulling
the
trigger
durazo
said
my
feeling
is
that
many
of
them
are
gathering
information
and
if
the
trade
war
continues
for
a
long
time
just
making
the
decision
of
coming
into
mexico
mexico
offers
the
advantage
of
much
shorter
delivery
times
to
the
united
states
but
it
was
only
three
months
ago
that
president
trump
was
threatening
tariffs
on
goods
made
there
trump
ultimately
dropped
that
threat
trump
has
urged
companies
worried
about
tariffs
to
move
production
back
to
the
united
states
but
only
about
of
the
companies
operating
in
china
are
considering
that
according
to
the
american
chamber
survey
harry
moser
who
runs
the
reshoring
initiative
estimates
that
about
of
those
companies
would
find
manufacturing
in
the
u.s.
competitive
if
they
took
tariffs
transportation
and
all
other
costs
into
account
probably
they
made
the
right
decision
going
to
china
when
the
wages
there
were
so
low
moser
said
probably
they
should
have
reevaluated
it
five
years
ago
but
now
that
they
feel
they
have
to
bring
a
lot
of
work
out
of
china
now
is
the
perfect
time
to
reevaluate
the
u.s.
as
an
alternative
as
the
trade
war
drags
on
more
companies
may
rethink
their
presence
in
china
but
for
now
most
are
staying
put
that
includes
crown
crafts
a
louisiana-based
company
that
makes
baby
blankets
and
other
products
in
china
ceo
randall
chestnut
told
investors
this
summer
that
he
looked
into
shifting
production
to
a
half-dozen
different
countries
but
ultimately
he
decided
it
was
cheaper
to
stay
in
china
and
simply
pay
trump's
tariffs
so
we
think
that
we're
going
to
have
to
bite
the
bullet
and
you
know
pass
it
on
chestnut
said
during
a
quarterly
earnings
call
according
to
the
american
chamber
survey
of
the
u.s.
companies
now
operating
in
china
have
no
plans
to
relocate
