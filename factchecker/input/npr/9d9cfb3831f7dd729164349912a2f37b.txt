where

meeting
updated

et
earlier
this
week
president
trump
cited
concerns
about
corruption
as
his
rationale
for
blocking
security
assistance
to
ukraine
but
in
a
letter
sent
to
four
congressional
committees
in
may
of
this
year
and
obtained
by
npr
undersecretary
of
defense
for
policy
john
rood
informed
lawmakers
that
he
certified
that
the
government
of
ukraine
has
taken
substantial
actions
to
make
defense
institutional
reforms
for
the
purposes
of
decreasing
corruption
and
increasing
accountability
the
certification
was
required
by
law
for
the
release
of
million
in
security
assistance
for
ukraine
that
aid
was
blocked
by
the
white
house
until
sept
and
has
since
been
released
it
must
be
spent
before
sept
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
at
a
news
conference
on
wednesday
wrapping
up
a
three-day
visit
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
trump
repeated
his
professed
concerns
about
corruption
as
the
reason
for
holding
up
million
in
security
assistance
to
ukraine
we
want
to
make
sure
that
country
is
honest
trump
said
of
ukraine
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
corruption
if
you
don't
talk
about
corruption
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
corrupt
the
defense
department
announced
in
mid-june
that
it
would
be
sending
million
in
security
assistance
to
ukraine
which
has
been
battling
pro-russia
separatists
near
its
eastern
border
with
russia
since
but
the
white
house
blocked
that
assistance
in
july
that
was
prior
to
a
phone
call
trump
made
to
ukraine's
recently
elected
leader
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
according
to
notes
of
that
call
released
by
the
white
house
on
wednesday
trump
asked
zelenskiy
to
look
into
reports
that
former
vice
president
and
current
democratic
presidential
hopeful
joe
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
ukrainian
government
from
looking
into
his
son
hunter's
activities
in
ukraine
trump
has
denied
seeking
to
pressure
zelenskiy
into
carrying
out
such
a
probe
by
withholding
the
military
assistance
that
aid
was
released
sept
after
an
angry
bipartisan
response
from
congress
to
reports
that
the
money
was
being
withheld
some
congressional
republicans
are
defending
trump's
conversation
with
zelenskiy
i
think
to
suggest
that
this
phone
call
was
the
president
of
the
united
states
threatening
to
withhold
aid
to
the
ukraine
unless
they
did
his
political
bidding
said
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
is
simply
ridiculous
another
explanation
trump
has
been
giving
for
blocking
the
ukraine
assistance
is
his
view
that
european
allies
are
not
contributing
enough
to
that
aid
europe
and
other
nations
must
contribute
to
ukraine
he
told
reporters
at
the
u.n.
on
tuesday
because
they're
not
doing
it
just
the
united
states
we're
putting
up
the
bulk
of
the
money
eight
european
embassies
in
washington
contacted
by
npr
on
wednesday
reported
no
attempts
by
the
trump
administration
over
the
summer
to
increase
their
contributions
to
ukraine
there
was
no
effort
at
all
said
a
senior
official
at
the
german
embassy
who
requested
anonymity
to
speak
freely
the
topic
was
not
brought
up
at
all
at
recent
meetings
we've
had
european
diplomats
hasten
to
point
out
that
they
have
been
contributing
far
more
to
ukraine
than
what
trump
has
claimed
our
bilateral
assistance
to
ukraine
of
billion
is
almost
at
the
u.s.
level
said
the
german
embassy
official
the
u.s.
has
disbursed
nearly
billion
since
in
security
assistance
to
ukraine
while
the
european
union
has
provided
about
billion
mostly
in
the
form
of
loans
house
committees
that
are
starting
impeachment
inquiries
are
virtually
certain
to
probe
further
into
trump's
reasons
for
holding
back
assistance
to
ukraine
while
he
was
seeking
an
investigation
there
of
a
potential
democratic
rival
in
next
year's
election
