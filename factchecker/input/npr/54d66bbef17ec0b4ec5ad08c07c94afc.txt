warn

other
influence
operations
might
be
the
new
normal

western
politics

what's
been
perceived
as
comparatively
low-cost
successes
for
the
campaigns
that
targeted
europe
the
united
kingdom
and
the
u.s.
former
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
who
documented
the
russian
attack
in
detail
earlier
this
year
and
whose
office
charged
a
number
of
russians
in
connection
with
the
election
attack
told
congress
that
influence
operations
were
still
taking
place
one
thing
that
has
changed
however
is
the
awareness
of
officials
at
every
level
about
the
importance
of
cybersecurity
and
the
new
attitude
by
social
media
companies
about
the
need
to
plan
ahead
and
act
quickly
for
example
twitter
facebook
and
google
all
revealed
in
real
time
that
they
had
deactivated
a
number
of
fake
accounts
that
were
directing
messaging
at
protesters
in
hong
kong
which
the
companies
linked
to
a
chinese
government
influence
campaign
if
those
practices
continue
in
the
american
election
context
that
could
give
the
public
a
clearer
understanding
about
the
information
environment
on
social
media
and
the
amount
of
energy
that
a
foreign
government
was
exerting
to
try
to
influence
american
politics
