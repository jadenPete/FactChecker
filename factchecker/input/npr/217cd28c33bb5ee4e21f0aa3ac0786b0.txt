former
vice
president
joe
biden
has
made
the
case
for
going
back
to
a
nationwide
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
making
it
even
stronger
some
have
reacted
with
quizzical
expressions
back
stronger
yes
twenty
five
years
ago
when
biden
was
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
congress
passed
the
public
safety
and
recreational
firearms
use
protection
act
commonly
called
the
assault
weapons
ban
it
prohibited
the
manufacture
or
sale
for
civilian
use
of
certain
semi-automatic
weapons
the
act
also
banned
magazines
that
could
accommodate
rounds
or
more
assault
weapons
military-style
firearms
designed
to
fire
rapidly
are
a
threat
to
our
national
security
and
we
should
treat
them
as
such
biden
wrote
in
his
weekend
op-ed
anyone
who
pretends
there's
nothing
we
can
do
is
lying
and
holding
that
view
should
be
disqualifying
for
anyone
seeking
to
lead
our
country
the
earlier
ban
was
enacted
as
a
subsection
of
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
an
election-year
package
meant
to
show
that
democrats
were
tough
on
crime
times
were
different
then
more
americans
said
they
worried
about
violent
crime
and
the
threat
associated
with
criminals
armed
with
powerful
weapons
so
among
other
things
biden
and
democrats
got
behind
stricter
sentencing
guidelines
and
expanding
the
category
of
federal
crimes
punishable
with
the
death
penalty
at
the
time
biden
defended
the
legislation
against
charges
of
weakness
by
saying
we
do
everything
but
hang
people
for
jaywalking
in
this
bill
eagerness
to
tackle
crime
rates
made
at
least
some
democrats
in
also
willing
to
address
the
role
of
guns
particularly
those
perceived
as
more
dangerous
and
which
had
been
turned
on
innocent
citizens
in
his
times

biden
salutes
the
senator
often
credited
as
the
architect
of
the
ban
dianne
feinstein
of
california
then
in
just
her
second
year
as
a
senator
feinstein
took
over
as
chief
sponsor
of
a
bill
originally
offered
by
ohio
democrat
howard
metzenbaum
in
after
a
mass
shooting
on
a
schoolyard
in
stockton
calif
that
shooting
took
the
lives
of
five
children
and
injured
others
and
a
teacher
feinstein's
resolve
to
carry
this
legislation
forward
was
bolstered
when
eight
more
people
were
killed
and
six
injured
in
another
california
horror
this
time
at
a
law
firm
in
san
francisco
it
was
the
mass
shooting
at
california
street
she
later
said
that
was
the
tipping
point
for
me
that's
what
really
motivated
me
to
push
for
a
ban
on
assault
weapons
but
to
secure
the
votes
for
passage
the
ban's
sponsors
agreed
to
allow
those
who
already
had
these
guns
to
keep
them
biden
now
says
he
would
initiate
a
buyback
program
instead
although
it
isn't
clear
how
that
might
work
or
how
effective
it
might
be
sponsors
also
accepted
a
sunset
provision
by
which
the
ban
would
automatically
expire
after
years
unless
renewed
by
a
vote
of
congress
even
so
the
ban
only
got
votes
in
the
senate
on
its
way
to
inclusion
in
the
overall
crime
bill
which
was
signed
into
law
by
president
bill
clinton
the
world
turns
by
the
time
those
years
had
passed
however
the
political
climate
had
changed
republicans
by

held
the

throughout

period

for

the
gop
had
just
increased
its
numbers
in
both
chambers
in
the
midterm
elections
of
a
political
season
dominated
by
anxiety
after
the
terror
attacks
of
sept
feinstein
and
others
made
numerous
efforts
to
restore
the
ban
that
year
and
over
the
next
several
years
when
barack
obama
was
elected
president
in
he
made
renewing
the
ban
part
of
his
agenda
efforts
were
mounted
again
after
the
sandy
hook
elementary
school
shooting
in
december
but
none
bore
fruit
the
attempt
to
reinstate
the
ban
after
sandy
hook
attracted
fewer
votes
in
the
senate
than
feinstein
had
mustered
in
an
attempt
to
renew
the
ban

biden
has
come
to
rue
much
about
the
legislation
it
led
to
a
surge
in
prison
populations
that
has
since
been
reviled
as
mass
incarceration
that
proved
disproportionately
injurious
to
african
americans
biden
has
been
upbraided
for
it
by
his
rivals
since
this
year's
democratic
presidential
contest
began
but
in
the
most
immediate
consequence
of
the
crime
bill
was
a
backlash
against
the
assault
weapons
ban
among
gun
advocates
the
midterm
elections
that
fall
were
already
difficult
for
the
democrats
who
had
to
defend
the
new
north
american
free
trade
agreement
some
higher
taxes
and
a
scandal
in
the
house
banking
system
adding
in
the
blowback
over
the
assault
weapons
ban
particularly
intense
in
the
rural
south
and
west
turned
the
midterm
into
a
debacle
for
democrats
they
lost
control
of
both
the
senate
and
house
the
latter
for
the
first
time
in
years
among
those
defeated
that
fall
was
year
veteran
jack
brooks
a
texas
democrat
who
had
been
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
when
the
crime
bill
passed
brooks
had
tried
to
have
the
assault
weapons
ban
removed
from
the
bill
and
was
himself
a
longtime
member
of
the
national
rifle
association
but
it
was
not
enough
to
save
him
in
rural
texas
that
fall
the
sense
that
gun
control
cost
democrats
votes
intensified
after
the
presidential
election
of
that
year's
democratic
nominee
vice
president
al
gore
of
tennessee
could
not
carry
his
home
state
or
other
swing
states
won
by
the
clinton-gore
ticket
in
the
s
gore
surely
paid
a
price
for
his
stances
on
coal
and
other
issues
as
well
but
much
of
the
blame
for
his
narrow
electoral
college
loss
fell
on
voters
response
to
his
positions
on
guns
in
when
the
republican
congress
refused
to
renew
the
assault
weapons
ban
the
democrats
presidential
nominee
was
massachusetts
sen
john
kerry
who
sought
to
style
himself
as
a
hunter
and
gun
owner
but
nonetheless
supported
the
ban
and
its
renewal
the
electoral
college
that
year
looked
a
lot
like
and
kerry
could
have
won
had
he
carried
ohio
but
in
that
state
as
elsewhere
a
poor
showing
in
rural
counties
doomed
the
democratic
nominee
what
effect
did
the
ban
have
today
we
can
look
back
at
the
years
of
the
ban
and
at
years
since
its
expiration
critics
of
the
ban
have
argued
that
it
violated
second
amendment
rights
while
accomplishing
little
and
evidence
suggests
it
did
not
do
much
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
gun
violence
overall
what
it
did
its
defenders
reply
was
reduce
the
number
of
people
killed
in
mass
shootings
both
sides
of
the
debate
claim
vindication
in
subsequent
research
comparing
the
various
studies
is
difficult
because
they
use
different
definitions
of
assault
weapon
and
mass
shooting
one
thing
is
clear
assault
weapons
like
those
once
restricted
by
the
ban
were
used
in
the
most
memorable
events
that
have
defined
the
current
era
of
random
massacre
including
at
sandy
hook
in
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
parkland
fla
in
and
this
month
in
texas
and
ohio
they
are
the
emblem
of
the
nation's
soul
sickness
over
these
tragedies
so
today
democratic
candidates
stand
by
the
assault
weapons
ban
despite
its
political
costs
in
the
past
and
potential
costs
in
the
future
president
trump
now
calls
for
having
strong
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
but
does
not
call
for
new
restrictions
on
assault
weapons
there's
no
political
appetite
for
it
he
says
but
many
surveys
show
the
opposite
a
survey
done
this
month
by
morning
consult
and
politico
found
in
voters
including
of
republicans
supported
a
ban
on
assault-style
weapons
even
higher
percentages
supported
a
ban
on
high-capacity
magazines
and
a
purchase
age
of
at
least
for
any
gun
the
survey
done
aug
included
interviews
and
had
a
margin
of
error
of
two
percentage
points
given
that
similar
percents
supported
a
ban
after
the
shootings
of
the
early
s
and
after
the
sandy
hook
and
parkland
tragedies
there
would
seem
to
be
a
long-term
pattern
whether
that
can
be
translated
into
legislative
action
by
the
current
political
establishment
is
as
always
another
question
