lost
in
all
the
brouhaha
about
president
trump's
scuttled
plan
to
buy
greenland
from

has
been
this
what
do
the
greenlandic
people
think
about
the
whole
thing
in
the
small
capital
city
of
nuuk
everybody
is
talking
about
it
says
alexander
montgomery-andersen
a
year-old
greenlandic
dancer
and
choreographer
it's
a
little
comical
greenlander
lasse
norregaard
suggested
on
facebook
that
trump
trade
hawaii
to
greenland
in
exchange
for
an
area
of
the
same
approximate
size
on
the
greenland
ice
cap
the
area
he
said
will
be
the
perfect
geopolitical
stronghold
for
you
to
do
whatever
you
wish
others
joked
that
maybe
all
this
talk
would
improve
tourism
which
is
a
fairly
young
industry
but
many
greenlanders
were
angered
and
upset
by
trump's
comments
which
they
consider
a
threat
to
their
sovereignty
and
human
rights
it's
dead
serious
for
greenland
says
aqqaluk
lynge
a
former
president
of
the
inuit
circumpolar
council
to
talk
about
buying
a
whole
nation
and
the
people
is
i
think
extremely
imperialistic
and
should
not
be
something
that
we
hear
world
leaders
say
in
says
sara
olsvig
a
former
greenlandic
politician
who
now
works
in
human
rights
it
shows
that
we
are
still
living
in
a
world
where
indigenous
peoples
or
self-governing
nations
even
within
states
are
seen
as
something
that
can
be
bought
and
sold
the
relationship
between
greenland
and
denmark
is
long
and
complicated
while
greenland
was
once
a
colony
it
hasn't
been
one
for
decades
the
prime
minister
of
denmark
mette
frederiksen
visited
nuuk

weekend

told
reporters
greenland

so
what
is
greenland's
political
status
it
is
a
bit
complicated
today
greenland
is
still
part
of
the
danish
kingdom
but
it
is
not
owned
by
denmark
and
it
is
not
a
danish
colony
greenland
has
its
own
parliament
and
government
though
some
issues
like
defense
and
security
are
handled
in
copenhagen
in
recent
decades
there's
been
a
move
by
greenlanders
toward
autonomy
and
perhaps
ultimately
full
independence
currently
the
island's
population
is
only
people
though
the
country
is
enormous
three
times
the
size
of
texas
most
greenlanders
have
indigenous
roots
the
history
of
inuit
people
in
greenland
goes
years
back
olsvig
explains
our
people
the
inuit
people
have
been
living
in
the
arctic
moving
back
and
forth
across
the
arctic
between
russia
and
greenland
for
many
many
thousands
of
years
over
those
thousands
of
years
inuit
people
hunted
and
fished
in
the
harsh
icy
environment
around
of
the
island
is
covered
by
a
gigantic
ice
sheet
traditionally
inuit
people
are
a
nomadic
people
we
would
travel
to
wherever
we
could
hunt
and
live
different
places
on
the
land
during
summer
and
during
winter
she
says
some
of
the
first
qallunaaq
or
white
people
to
arrive
in
greenland
were
the
vikings
around
that
was
erik
the
red
and
he
was
the
guy
who
named
greenland
greenland
olsvig
adds
south
greenland
is
quite
green
actually
but
if
you
look
at
the
world
map
you
will
see
that
greenland
is
quite
white
because
we
have
the
ice
cap
the
viking
settlers
apparently
didn't
make
it
through
the
little
ice
age
that
began
in
the
s
in
a
christian
missionary
from
norway
came
to
greenland
and
he
didn't
find
any
of
the
norse
people
but
he
found
inuit
olsvig
says
his
name
was
hans
egede
at
the
time
norway
was
part
of
the
danish
kingdom
that
we
see
as
the
beginning
of
the
colonization
after
the
missionaries
started
to
arrive
greenlanders
began
to
settle
in
towns
and
give
up
the
nomadic
life
danish
and
greenlandic
people
have
intermarried
over
generations
many
people
who
identify
as
indigenous
greenlandic
people
have
danish
names
many
also
have
blue
eyes
around
of
greenlanders
are
protestant
although
many
people
also
practice
spiritual
rituals
that
predate
the
nordic
missionaries

in

of
colonization
we
kept
our
language
and
many
of
our
traditions
olsvig
says
school
instruction
is
in
kalaallisut
or
greenlandic
there's
a
national
greenlandic
radio
station
and
newspapers
are
written
in
greenlandic
as
well
as
danish
there's
even
a
greenlandic
translation
of
harry
potter
olsvig
does
say
some
cultural
traditions
like
throat
singing
and
drum
dancing
which
have
endured
among
the
inuit
in
canada
and
alaska
were
lost
for
a
long
time
in
greenland
though
they
are
starting
to
make
a
comeback
so
what
is
life
like
in
greenland
now
montgomery-andersen's
mother
is
american
and
he
spent
his
sophomore
year
of
high
school
in
austin
texas
so
he
has
had
plenty
of
experience
explaining
to
clueless
americans
what
life
is
like
in
greenland
i
tricked
people
a
lot
he
says
laughing
i
would
say
sure
we
have
polar
bears
and
seals
as
pets
or
yes
we
live
in
igloos
in
fact
greenlanders
live
in
houses
and
apartments
greenlanders
interviewed
for
this
story
credit
the
scandinavian
relationship
for
their
democratic
system
of
government
and
the
provision
of
free
education
and
free
health
care
high-speed
internet
is
available
montgomery-andersen
says
even
in
a
tiny
isolated
town
of
people
that
he
visited
there
are
challenges
to
living
in
a
country
that
is
so
huge
and
covered
in
so
much
ice
the
only
inhabitable
parts
are
out
on
the
edges
mostly
in
the
south
farthest
from
the
arctic
circle
because
each
town
is
far
from
each
other
and
there's
so
few
people
in
each
town
there's
no
roads
or
train
tracks
montgomery-andersen
says
you
can't
take
a
bus
from
one
town
to
another
you
have
to
sail
by
boat
or
take
an
airplane
which
makes
each
place
very
isolated

a

by

danish

the
greenlandic
relationship
with
denmark
has
been
mostly
peaceful
though
not
without
pain
and
conflict
as
npr's
rebecca
hersher
has
reported
denmark
has
shut
down
small
isolated
towns
moving
people
into
bigger
towns
which
mental
health
experts
say
has
contributed
to
greenland's
extremely
high
suicide
rate
olsvig
also
points
out
that
up
until
the
s
denmark
would
classify
greenlandic
children
as
legally
fatherless
if
they
were
born
outside
marriage
the
law
on
this
was
not
changed
until
we
still
see
the
consequences
of
having
been
colonized
the
colonial
status
of
greenland
lasted
from
the
s
until
after
world
war
ii
when
its
political
standing
began
to
change
in
greenland
voted
in
a
referendum
for
home
rule
which
led
to
the
establishment
of
greenland's
parliament
then
in
the
act
on
greenland
self-government
went
into
effect
which
gives
greenland
the
right
to
hold
a
vote
on
declaring
independence
from
denmark
with
the
self-government
agreement
with
denmark
all
people
that
live
in
greenland
are
recognized
as
a
people
pursuant
to
international
law
olsvig
says
we
are
also
part
of
an
indigenous
people
and
we
live
with
these
two
different
political
categories
today
this
complex
history
is
what
trump
waded
into
when
he
said
he
wanted
to
buy
greenland
from
denmark
i
hope
from
all
of
the
attention
that
this
has
been
given
more
world
leaders
will
learn
about
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
and
of
all
of
the
many
different
kinds
of
political
constructions
we
have
in
the
world
where
people
actually
have
the
right
to
self-determination
olsvig
says
she
believes
that
would
be
one
good
thing
to
come
out
of
all
this
fuss
