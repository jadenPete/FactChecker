hearing
on

several
democratic
presidential
candidates
are
calling
for
the
impeachment
of
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
after
the
new
york
times
published
an
essay
sept
describing
alleged
sexual
misconduct
that
occurred
during
his
college
years
at
yale
new
york
times
reporters
robin
pogrebin
and
kate
kelly
who
wrote
the
essay
covered
kavanaugh's
contentious
confirmation
hearings
in
which
christine
blasey
ford
alleged
that
he
had
sexually
assaulted
her
at
a
house
party
when
they
were
both
teenagers
the
fbi
conducted
an
investigation
into
kavanaugh's
behavior
but
it
was
restricted
in
terms
of
time
and
scope
the
senate
ultimately
voted
in
favor
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
in
their
new
book
the
education
of
brett
kavanaugh
pogrebin
and
kelly
detail
what
is
already
known
about
kavanaugh
and
extend
the
investigation
into
parts
of
his
history
and
events
alleged
to
have
taken
place

note
pogrebin
and
kelly's
reporting
noted
below
includes
a
graphic
description
of
alleged
sexual
misconduct
pogrebin
and
kelly
research
allegations
by
deborah
ramirez
a
yale
alumna
who
says
that
kavanaugh
put
his
penis
in
her
face
during
a
college
party
when
they
were
both
freshmen
they
also
raise
allegations
of
a
similar
incident
detailed
by
a
male
yale
classmate
though
neither
he
nor
the
woman
allegedly
involved
speaks
publicly
about
it
in
response
to
the
latest
news
president
trump
tweeted
brett
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the
lies
being
told
about
him
are
unbelievable
false
accusations
without
recrimination
when
does
it
stop
they
are
trying
to
influence
his
opinions
can't
let
that
happen
pogrebin
who
was
in
kavanaugh's
class
at
yale
says
that
ramirez's
account
never
got
its
due
during
the
confirmation
hearings
because
the
republicans
in
charge
of
the
process
clearly
had
no
interest
in
adding
yet
another
story
and
another
potential
victim
to
the
public
dialogue
and
giving
ramirez
the
legitimacy
of
a
public
forum
although
ramirez
was
made
available
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
and
then
her
lawyers
ultimately
gave
the
fbi
a
list
of
more
than
two
dozen
potential
witnesses
who
could
add
credence
to
her
story
ultimately
the
judiciary
committee
determined
that
her
allegations
were
not
relevant
to
the
process
pogrebin
says
kelly
grew
up
in
washington
d.c.
and
attended
a
girls
high
school
in
the
same
social
network
as
kavanaugh's
high
school
she
notes
that
alcohol
abuse
was
a
common
theme
throughout
their
investigation
of
kavanaugh
the
drinking
was
something
of
a
throughline
kelly
says
generally
speaking
kavanaugh
was
regarded
as
a
pretty
polite
responsible
well-mannered
young
person
but
when
he
was
heavily
drinking
and
also
at
times
when
he
was
simply
trying
to
impress
his
friends
like
in
the
schoolyard
a
different
side
of
him
came
out
editor's
note
the
interview
with
pogrebin
and
kelly
was
recorded
on
sept
on
deborah
ramirez's
allegations
about
kavanaugh
robin
pogrebin
her
allegations
were
that
at
a
party
freshman
year
in
the
freshman
dorm
on
old
campus
which
is
the
quad
where
most
freshmen
live
she
recalls
being
part
of
a
drinking
game
with
a
rather
small
group
of
mostly
guys
with
drinks
being
passed
around
presumably
beer
where
she
was
continually
and
repeatedly
targeted
to
drink
kind
of
drink
drink
debbie
drink
which
she
did
to
excess
and
she
had
never
had
alcohol
in
any
meaningful
way
before
coming
to
yale
and
she
recalls
that
at
some
point
there
was
a
kind
of
a
fake
penis
in
her
face
she
swatted
it
away
and
then
subsequently
there
was
a
real
penis
thrust
in
her
face
and
when
she
looked
up
she
saw
brett
kavanaugh
pulling
up
his
pants
and
laughing
and
all
of
his
friends
who
were
also
in
the
drinking
game
laughing
as
well
which
she
found
incredibly
humiliating
and
an
experience
that
stayed
with
her
on
why
ramirez's
allegations
are
relevant
pogrebin
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
you
talk
to
about
the
ramirez
allegations
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
aware
of
them
they
kind
of
say
what's
the
big
deal
and
you
can
see
from
the
outside
how
that
perspective
is
conceivable
basically
someone
exposing
himself
to
her
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
you
could
dismiss
that
as
just
so
much
kind
of
drunken
juvenile
fun
boys
being
boys
if
she
were
made
of
stronger
stuff
maybe
she
would
have
just
said
get
that
out
of
my
face
and
go
on
with
her
life
what's
important
and
what
my
reporting
really
revealed
was
that
it's
really
essential
to
look
at
the
background
of
a
person
like
deborah
ramirez
and
indeed
anyone
who
comes
into
a
place
like
yale
that
has
made
me
sort
of
newly
sensitive
to
this
idea
that
not
everyone
comes
into
college
equally
equipped
to
navigate
situations
like
that
she
was
raised
in
working-class
shelton
conn
her
father
was
a
cable
splicer
she
had
a
strict
catholic
upbringing
did
things
by
the
book
academically
distinguished
not
at
all
experienced
sexually
or
in
terms
of
alcohol
and
also
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
financially
her
family
had
to
scrape
together
money
for
her
to
get
through
yale
in
addition
to
getting
loans
she
worked
in
the
college
dining
halls
she
worked
at
college
reunions
cleaning
up
she
worked
at
carvel
in
the
summers
she
also
has
puerto
rican
heritage
and
as
we
know
now
there
is
a
lot
more
sensitivity
to
the
experience
of
people
of
color
but
at
the
time
there
were
jokes
on
campus
that
she
experienced
of
people
saying
how
do
you
get
in
here
is
it
because
you're
puerto
rican
so
she
already
felt
kind
of
behind
the
eight
ball
at
yale
had
a
real
deep
sense
of
inadequacy
that
maybe
she
didn't
belong
there
and
wasn't
gonna
be
able
to
hack
it
so
this
experience
with
kavanaugh
only
confirmed
those
insecurities
in
a
way
that
was
formative
on
why
christine
blasey
ford
came
forward
kate
kelly
i
really
think
she
was
motivated
by
a
sense
of
civic
duty
her
comment
to
me
was
to
the
effect
that
someone
did
something
to
me
when
i
was
my
kid's
age
she's
a
mother
of
two
adolescent
or
teenage
boys
at
this
point
and
i
thought
the
key
decision-makers
who
were
influencing
the
supreme
court
nomination
and
confirmation
should
know
about
it
and
to
not
say
anything
would
not
be
an
ok
thing
to
do
in
my
book
that's
a
summation
of
what
she
said
i
think
that
coming
forward
occurred
at
great
personal
stress
and
eventually
cost
to
her
and
her
family
she
lost
her
privacy
she
lost
her
security
for
a
period
of
time
she
still
receives
death
threats
and
as
recently
as
earlier
this
year
she
was
having
to
stay
in
undisclosed
locations
because
of
death
threats
so
it
was
very
difficult
i
don't
think
she
knew
the
half
of
what
might
happen
when
she
was
contemplating
this
but
at
a
very
minimum
she
knew
that
her
name
would
be
in
the
public
domain
and
she
was
likely
to
be
the
subject
of
debate
and
that
alone
was
very
stressful
for
her
so
i
think
it
was
a
sense
of
civic
duty
and
i
think
although
she
is
a
democrat
and
probably
doesn't
share
most
of
brett
kavanaugh's
ideology
it
really
had
to
do
with
this
sense
of
ethics
and
civic
obligation
on
the
similarities
between
ramirez's
account
and
blasey
ford's
testimony
pogrebin
as
i
talk
to
ramirez
it
really
struck
me
terry
that
she
could
not
recall
these
events
and
recount
them
of
years
ago
without
weeping
i've
done
enough
of
these
metoo
stories
to
see
that
these
experiences
stay
with
these
women
and
continue
to
resonate
no
matter
how
buried
no
matter
whether
they
told
people
or
not
at
the
time
they
don't
go
away
and
that
is
clear
with
this
experience
that
for
her
the
humiliation
of
it
was
almost
as
bad
as
just
the
sexual
experience
itself
that
just
having
people
laugh
at
her
is
really
what
actually
stands
out
in
her
mind
the
most
which
is
interesting
because
it
dovetails
so
much
with
what
blasey
ford
said
about
remembering
the
laughter
in
the
room
when
when
she
was
allegedly
attacked
on
how
kavanaugh's
relationship
to
women
has
changed
pogrebin
he
grew
up
in
this
milieu
that
was
largely
male
he
went
to
an
all-male
high
school
he
was
very
much
associated
with
athletes
there
was
a
currency
that
was
kind
of
jocular
and
disparaging
of
women
in
a
casual
perhaps
only
verbal
way
sort
of
ironically
that
brett
kavanaugh
was
not
like
a
ladies
man
he
kind
of
didn't
really
have
the
moves
he
didn't
get
the
girls
and
that's
kind
of
why
he
seems
to
have
relied
on
alcohol
conceivably
to
kind
of
make
himself
feel
a
little
more
socially
relaxed
because
he
wasn't
necessarily
that
adept
that
said
we
did
find
after
considerable
digging
that
in
the
years
since
these
allegations
he
basically
grew
up
in
our
view
he
became
a
better
man
either
because
he
sort
of
consciously
sought
to
reform
these
ways
or
he
just
simply
matured
into
a
person
who
actually
ended
up
promoting
women
in
terms
of
his
own
practice
hiring
female
clerks
to
a
notable
degree
and
promoting
women
in
the
profession
and
being
a
family
man
and
having
daughters
of
his
own
whose
basketball
team
he
coaches
and
actually
being
an
individual
who
people
speak
highly
of
in
terms
of
character
and
professional
behavior
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
on
the
issue
of
memory
and
kavanaugh's
past
kelly
it's
an
interesting
prism
through
which
to
gauge
these
accounts
as
well
as
kavanaugh's
denial
we
had
a
challenge
in
assessing
kavanaugh's
straightforwardness
at
the
hearings
because
after
all
we're
not
inside
of
his
head
we
don't
know
what
if
anything
he
does
remember
and
if
he's
giving
us
the
full
picture
of
what's
in
his
head
but
without
knowing
that
it's
very
hard
to
say
that
he
lied
he
may
be
inaccurate
about
things
because
we
have
other
eyewitnesses
who
remember
it
differently
who
are
credible
he
may
be
telling
a
sort
of
a
shaded
truth
that's
not
a
straightforward
lie
but
memory
is
tricky
to
discern
if
it's
not
your
own
on
different
attitudes
regarding
kavanaugh's
past
behavior
kelly
there
is
one
school
of
thought
that
says
if
this
type
of
behavior
which
is
to
say
sexual
assault
or
sexually
themed
mistreatment
of
women
even
just
verbal
sort
of
misogynistic
commentary
if
this
is
part
of
your
character
ever
it's
part
of
your
character
as
an
adult
and
that
a
supreme
court
justice
perhaps
should
be
held
to
the
very
highest
standard
of
conduct
of
any
public
officer
in
our
country
so
it's
all
relevant
doesn't
matter
when
it
happened
there
is
another
school
of
thought
that
deals
with
our
mentality
in
this
country
around
young
people
and
our
juvenile
justice
system
and
in
all
states
it
varies
a
little
bit
state
to
state
but
there
are
protections
for
juveniles
who
commit
crimes
and
court
proceedings
court
documents
settlements
any
sort
of
these
legal
processes
that
might
surround
a
juvenile
crime
are
kept
confidential
and
the
reason
is
we
want
to
give
young
people
a
chance
to
reform
themselves
and
learn
from
their
ways
and
not
be
haunted
by
the
mistakes
of
their
past
on
what
might
have
happened
if
kavanaugh
acknowledged
wrongdoing
during
his
confirmation
hearings
pogrebin
in
the
age
of
trump
who
is
all
about
fighting
back
and
kind
of
brooking
no
concessions
it
would
have
doomed
his
nomination
there
was
no
way
for
brett
kavanaugh
to
kind
of
be
a
human
flawed
individual
there
acknowledging
the
error
of
his
ways
and
asking
to
be
confirmed
anyway
kelly
i
think
the
outcomes
here
were
very
binary
i
think
either
he
was
going
to
be
named
to
the
supreme
court
or
he
was
potentially
going
to
lose
the
job
that
he
did
have
as
well
as
his
teaching
jobs
and
his
coaching
responsibilities
because
unfortunately
what
we're
seeing
now
in
our
culture
is
sort
of
the
accumulation
of
a
bunch
of
somewhat
toxic
crosscurrents
the
fighting
instinct
that
robin
has
talked
about
the
advent
of
social
media
and
the
sort
of
abuse
that
all
sorts
of
people
get
on
social
media
the
idea
that
your
behavior
has
to
be
up
to
a
certain
level
at
all
times
and
that
to
be
flawed
is
to
be
canceled
i
think
there
was
a
whole
accumulation
of
factors
that
made
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
kavanagh
to
say
something
to
the
effect
of
if
i
ever
hurt
someone
i'm
terribly
sorry
