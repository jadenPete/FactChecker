he's
asking
for

to

online
nearly
the
moment
republican
sen
johnny
isakson
announced
his
plans
to
resign
late
last
month
rumors
and
speculation
started
flying
about
whom
georgia
gov
brian
kemp
would
appoint
to
fill
the
seat
isakson
plans
to
leave
the
office
he
has
held
for
nearly
years
at
the
end
of
for
health
reasons
in
an
effort
to
ensure
an
open
and
transparent
appointment
process
kemp
has
opened
an
online
application
process
for
anyone
eligible
to
submit
their
resume
or
c.v.
within
the
first
two
days
the
governor
had
received
nearly
applications
and
they
are
all
being
made
public
we
will
carefully
vet
the
applicants
and
choose
a
person
who
best
reflects
our
values
our
state
and
our
vision
for
the
future
kemp
said
in
a
statement
per
the
georgia
constitution
any
georgia
residents
who
have
been
u.s.
citizens
for
at
least
nine
years
and
are
at
least
years
old
are
eligible
hopeful
senators
have
ranged
from
a
sitting
georgia
public
service
commissioner
to
a
home
depot
sales
associate
a
line
cook
to
a
theatre
technician
a
republican
political
talk
show
radio
host
and
one-time
congressional
candidate
to
an
elementary
school
principal
a
southwest
airlines
pilot
to
a
women's
gym
owner
one
of
the
hundreds
of
applicants
is
michael
ventimiglia
he
works
as
a
chef
in
a
restaurant
in
macon
ga
and
is
known
as
the
blues
musician
big
mike
he
decided
to
apply
because
he
says
he's
a
person
of
the
people
i'm
out
in
the
street
every
day
i'm
out
in
the
bars
i
play
with
a
lot
of
people
bikers
always
over
to
the
moose
lodge
the
black
clubs
and
i
hear
what
people
are
talking
about
that
most
politicians
don't
even
come
around
don't
come
close
to
he
says
politicians
today
play
on
division
hate
and
prejudice
and
i
think
politicians
keep
a
bunch
of
this
stuff
stirred
up
so
they
can
keep
their
job
without
hate
and
prejudice
they
have
nothing
to
do
he
says
his
chances
of
getting
the
job
are
slim
to
none
but
he
likes
the
idea
of
possibly
becoming
a
u.s.
senator
another
applicant
is
stuart
frohlinger
who
lives
in
athens
ga
and
retired
from
the
finance
industry
he
calls
himself
a
fiscally
conservative
and
socially
liberal
republican
and
cares
a
lot
about
people's
personal
finance
he
is
from
new
york
and
has
lived
in
georgia
for
about
years
most
people
go
through
life
without
a
financial
plan
living
either
pay
check
to
pay
check
or
even
if
they
have
a
lot
of
money
they
dribble
it
during
the
day
he
says
they
spend
it
i
think
as
a
senator
from
georgia
it's
one
thing
i
rarely
hear
the
georgia
government
really
asking
people
to
be
more
proactive
with
their
own
life's
finances
he
says
people
need
to
manage
their
finances
better
and
not
just
think
i
get
older
and
will
get
social
security
and
medicare
that
is
not
gonna
happen
that
easily
a
deep
deep
bench
the
online
application
process
changes
the
complete
dynamics
on
how
we
thought
this
appointment
was
going
to
play
out
said
georgia
republican
communications
strategist
brian
robinson
a
lot
of
people
who
may
have
been
in
the
private
conversations
with
kemp
now
aren't
going
to
want
to
put
their
name
out
there
as
someone
who
is
perhaps
not
particularly
happy
with
the
job
or
elected
office
they
have
now
he
said
the
names
of
several
sitting
members
of
congress
including
republican
rep
doug
collins
and
sitting
state
constitutional
officers
have
been
floated
as
potential
appointees
collins
confirmed
friday
according
to
the
hill
that
he
is
seeking
to
be
appointed
to
the
seat
kemp's
office
has
not
said
whether
formally
applying
is
required
but
robinson
said
the
governor
risks
making
the
process
look
silly
if
he
does
not
select
someone
from
the
public
applicant
pool
tharon
johnson
a
democratic
georgia
political
communications
consultant
said
the
decision
to
open
an
online
application
process
could
have
been
about
logistics
i
think
that
the
governor
and
his
staff
were
getting
inundated
with
so
many
calls
so
many
people
saying
pick
this
person
pick
that
person
hey
i
want
it
he
said
in
an
earlier
interview
with
wabe
kemp
said
i'm
obviously
hearing
from
a
lot
of
people
that
have
interest
or
who
have
recommended
people
to
me
there's
a
deep
deep
bench
for
us
to
pull
from
johnson
added
the
move
could
negate
a
line
of
attack
for
democrats
who
will
be
running
for
the
seat
in
no
matter
who
we
selected
we
were
going
to
say
oh
my
god
look
at
who
he
selected
this
process
wasn't
transparent
it
wasn't
open
the
public
didn't
have
any
input
per
the
georgia
constitution
the
governor's
appointee
will
only
hold
office
until
a
special
election
is
held
in
november
that
election
will
not
have
primaries
and
the
winner
will
face
reelection
again
in
that
means
both
of
georgia's
senate
seats
are
up
for
election
next
year
