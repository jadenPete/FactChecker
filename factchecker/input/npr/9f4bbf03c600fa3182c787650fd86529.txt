the
u.s.
has
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
since
to
make
election
practices
at
every
level
of
government
more
secure
americans
are
preparing
more
than
ever
to
safeguard
voting
as
the
nation
looks
ahead
to
the
democratic
primaries
and
the
general
election
next
year
what
no
one
can
say
for
certain
today
is
whether
all
the
work
may
turn
out
to
be
superfluous
or
whether
it'll
be
enough
national
security
officials
have
been
clear
about
two
things
first
that
the
russian
government
attacked
the
election
with
a
wave
of
active
measures
documented
in
prosecution
documents
and
the
final
report
of
former
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
and
second
that
those
measures
have
never
stopped
and
that
interference
is
likely
in
coming
elections
with
that
understanding
the
united
states
has
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
since
to
change
practices
at
every
level
of
government
a
lot
has
changed
more
states
are
buying
more
voting
machines
that
yield
paper
ballots
to
hedge
against
cyber-dangers
and
make
it
easier
to
audit
results
after
the
fact
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
working
more
closely
than
ever
with
state
and
local
elections
officials
to
raise
awareness
about
cybersecurity
dangers
and
new
practices
and
the
national
security
establishment
says
it
has
increased
the
tempo
of
its
operations
many
of
which
remain
clandestine
to
dissuade
foreign
governments
such
as
russia's
from
attempting
to
run
a
playbook
like
that
of
influence
specialists
launched
a
wave
of
cyberattacks
against
political
targets
across
the
united
states
and
released
some
of
the
material
they
stole
to
embarrass
their
victims
mainly
democrats
meanwhile
they
also
sought
to
amplify
agitation
online
with
false
accounts
disinformation
and
the
now-infamous
fake
news
facebook
twitter
google
and
other
big
tech
companies
say
they're
remaking
their
own
internal
practices
to
curtail
a
foreign
nation's
ability
to
use
their
services
to
spread
disinformation
or
aggravate
political
differences
among
users
representatives
from
those
companies
met
last
week
with
officials
from
the
fbi
dhs
and
the
intelligence
community
to
compare
notes
about
election
security
one
of
facebook's
top
cybersecurity
officers
said
and
that
followed
the
companies
decisions
to
reveal
what
they've
called
state-sponsored
influence
campaigns
in
real
time
in
the
latest
example
of
shutting
down
accounts
that
had
been
connected
with
a
government
information
operation
if
that
keeps
up
through
users
around
the
world
could
get
a
much
different
understanding
about
which
governments
might
be
trying
to
achieve
which
aims
through
fake
accounts
disinformation
and
agitation
the
name
of
the
game
will
it
all
be
enough
security
experts
and
supporters
of
further
changes
say
the
news
is
not
all
good
for
all
the
new
voting
equipment
expected
to
be
fielded
by
election
day
roughly
million
americans
are
expected
to
cast
votes
that
leave
no
paper
record
according
to
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
new
york
university
many
machines
also
likely
will
continue
to
run
on
obsolete
software
further
complicating
the
potential
cybersecurity
exposure
one
hacker
who
experimented
with
an
election
machine
at
a
conference
in
las
vegas
told
npr
he
wouldn't
trust
the
equipment's
software
to
run
his
toaster
there's
also
no
guarantee
that
an
influence
campaign
targeting
the
united
states
in
might
look
like
the
last
big
one
it
could
rely
more
on
spreading
sophisticated
fake
media
than
on
the
past
campaign's
comparatively
simple
posts
and
memes
its
political
dimensions
could
be
different
in
terms
of
the
candidates
or
parties
who
stand
to
benefit
the
nations
involved
could
be
different
too
president
trump
already
has
charged
china
with
trying
to
make
a
case
against
him
among
americans
because
beijing
has
wearied
of
the
trade
war
with
washington
the
chinese
have
sponsored
some
overt
messaging
that
makes
plain
their
unhappiness
will
that
include
a
clandestine
effort
too
in
russia's
interference
campaign
was
aimed
at
helping
trump
and
hurting
his
democratic
rival
hillary
clinton
since
then
russia
and
china
have
grown
strategically
closer
russia
also
has
become
a
big
booster
for
china
in
its
official
messaging
according
to
one
report
from
the
alliance
for
securing
democracy
looking
ahead
to
prospective
interference
in
requires
asking
whether
these
new
dynamics
might
prompt
russia
to
sit
out
another
big
wave
of
active
measures
whether
it
might
join
china
in
opposing
trump
if
beijing
in
fact
does
or
whether
these
allies
could
pick
opposite
sides
in
the
u.s.
election
trump
and
his
allies
have
emphasized
how
many
nations
other
than
russia
are
involved
with
trying
to
influence
the
u.s.
fighting
the
next
war
the
names
of
the
players
might
not
be
the
only
difference
in
as
compared
with
the
earlier
election
the
techniques
might
be
different
too
for
example
paul
barrett
of
new
york
university's
stern
center
for
business
and
human
rights
warned
in
a
report
that
influence-mongers
might
make
greater
use
of
different
social
platforms
including
instagram
and
whatsapp
katherine
charlet
and
danielle
citron
of
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
wrote
in
a
commentary
that
they
worry
about
high-quality
fake
video
and
audio
one
fear
is
these
fake
media
could
begin
to
circulate
with
corrosive
effects
on
americans
confidence
about
what
they
see
and
hear
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
said
it
wants
to
help
elections
officials
safeguard
against
ransomware
attacks
in
which
governments
lose
access
to
their
own
networks
unless
they
pay
the
attackers
ransomware
has
crippled
some
american
cities
and
although
it
hasn't
yet
disrupted
an
election
department
of
homeland
security
officials
worry
that
state
county
or
other
elections
systems
could
be
a
future
target
if
the
outlook
is
uncertain
what
is
also
clear
is
that
attitudes
across
the
board
have
changed
too
political
campaigns
federal
officials
state
and
local
supervisors
and
many
voters
are
going
into
with
their
eyes
open
in
a
way
that's
seldom
been
the
case
for
u.s.
elections
that
may
not
mean
the
coming
months
necessarily
run
smoothly
lt
gen
stephen
fogarty
head
of
u.s.
army
cyber
command
was
asked
about
the
outlook
for
his
russian
counterparts
he
told
an
audience
in
washington
that
he
expected
the
back-and-forth
in
cyberspace
to
be
energetic
it's
going
to
be
pretty
sporty
actually
