gomez
a
member
of
the
ms-
street
gang
was
wanted
in
connection
with
a
brutal
murder
in
plainfield
n.j.
that
took
place
in
may
police
almost
nabbed
him
a
month
afterward
but
gomez
jumped
out
a
second-story
window
and
escaped
investigators
finally
tracked
him
down
and
arrested
him
in
august
in
a
gym
parking
lot
in
northern
virginia
gomez's
capture
made
headlines
at
the
time
but
the
details
of
how
investigators
put
the
pieces
together
with
the
help
of
a
tipster
and
facial
recognition
technology
have
not
been
previously
reported
interviews
by
npr
with
law
enforcement
officials
and
others
now
reveal
the
role
that
digital
facial
recognition
software
played
in
the
case
at
a
time
when
authorities
use
of
such
technology
is
under
increasing
public
scrutiny
some
lawmakers
and
civil
liberties
advocates
warn
that
there
are
little
to
no
transparency
and
few
rules
governing
the
use
of
facial
scan
software
and
its
vast
surveillance
potential
leaving
the
door
open
to
possible
abuse
researchers
meanwhile
have
found
the
software
is
less
accurate
with
women
and
people
with
darker
skin
the
fbi
began
phasing
in
its
use
of
facial
analysis
software
around
local
and
state
police
also
have
used
the
technology
for
years
and
proponents
say
it's
an
important
investigative
tool
that
can
help
find
missing
children
prevent
driver's
license
fraud
or
in
gomez's
case
help
track
down
a
suspected

to
a
branch
of
ms-
in

outside

the
gang
began
in
los
angeles
in
the
s
but
has
expanded
since
then
and
now
has
a
presence
across
the
u.s.
and
central
america
like
many
gangs
ms-
is
involved
in
drug
dealing
prostitution
extortion
and
murder
it
tends
to
focus
many
of
its
activities
in
immigrant
communities
and
has
set
itself
apart
through
its
sheer
brutality
ms-
is
not
a
rigidly
hierarchical
organization
according
to
experts
instead
it
has
various
branches
or
cliques
that
operate
under
the
group's
umbrella
but
with
their
own
internal
leadership
and
rules
in
the
spring
of
the
plainfield
clique's
leadership
ordered
gomez
and
another
man
cruz
flores
to
kill
a
potential
recruit
julio
matute
who
was
suspected
of
disrespecting
ms-
because
he
associated
with
members
of
a
rival
gang
on
may
gomez
and
flores
spent
an
evening
at
matute's
apartment
drinking
smoking
weed
and
watching
tv
according
to
investigators
they
then
beat
him
in
the
head
with
a
baseball
bat
stabbed
him
times
in
the
back
with
a
screwdriver
and
slit
his
throat
he
was
stabbed
so
many
times
that
when
his
body
was
discovered
a
week
later
police
officers
thought
that
he
had
been
shot
with
a
shotgun
said
fbi
special
agent
dan
brunner
of
the
bureau's
newark
division
two
years
later
federal
prosecutors
indicted
more
than
a
dozen
members
of
the
plainfield
ms-
clique
for
racketeering
murder
and
other
crimes
gomez
and
flores
were
charged
in
that
indictment
in
connection
with
matute's
murder
by
the
end
of
flores
and
the
others
had
been
apprehended
tried
and
convicted
the
one
member
who
remained
at
large
was
gomez
in
april
the
fbi
placed
him
on
its
ten
most
wanted
fugitives
list
his
official
poster
included
three
photographs
a
young
man
with
short
black
hair
and
an
earring
and
described
him
as
an
extremely
violent
criminal
it
offered
a
reward
for
information
that
led
to
his
arrest
the
tip
a
few
months
after
gomez
appeared
on
the
most
wanted
list
the
fbi
received
a
tip
with
a
possible
lead
the
information
made
its
way
to
the
fbi's
washington
field
office
and
the
desk
of
special
agent
richard
stallings
investigators
believed
the
tipster
appeared
legitimate
he
knew
the
players
and
gang
dynamics
in
northern
virginia
what
the
tipster
told
them
was
that
he
recognized
the
man
in
gomez's
most
wanted
poster
he
knew
him
by
a
different
name
but
he
was
sure
it
was
the
same
man
after
a
few
more
meetings
the
source
provided
more
information
to
help
push
the
investigation
forward
including
facebook
profiles
that
he
said
had
pictures
of
the
individual
he
believed
to
be
gomez
he
gave
us
some
screen
names
we
were
able
to
track
down
stallings
said
stallings
and
his
fellow
investigators
went
through
the
facebook
pages
and
downloaded
photos
that
the
source
identified
as
gomez
not
any
photo
will
do
the
perspective
has
to
be
right
and
the
file
itself
must
be
good
enough
to
be
of
use
to
investigators
the
quality
of
the
picture
has
to
be
reviewable
if
it
doesn't
have
enough
of
the
facial
features
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
plug
it
in
and
have
a
solid
match
stallings
said
so
we
had
to
screen
and
find
enough
of
the
pictures
that
we
thought
had
the
qualities
needed
to
make
the
matches
and
assessments

ran

we

hey
can
we

are
we
looking
at
the
right
guy
stallings
said
about
a
week
later
they
got
a
reply
the
face
services
unit
came
back
with
a
match
but
not
for
gomez
instead
the
photos
matched
a
man
in
official
records
named
jesus
lopez
centoreo
centoreo
had
been
picked
up
for
marijuana
possession
in
after
jumping
a
metro
turnstile
in
arlington
va
he
had
gone
through
initial
processing
his
fingerprints
were
taken
and
he
was
photographed
for
a
mug
shot
but
was
then
released
he
didn't
show
up
for
his
court
date
and
so
a
warrant
had
been
issued
for
his
arrest
despite
the
name
confusion
investigators
still
felt
their
source
was
solid
stallings
said
in
part
because
there
were
other
physical
identifiers
including
tattoos
that
made
them
think
they
were
on
the
right
track
they
also
had
another
lead
to
pursue
from
the
facebook
pages
agents
had
found
several
photos
of
the
suspect
with
a
woman
they
ran
photos
of
her
through
the
bureau's
facial
recognition
software
they
got
a
match
from
the
criminal
mug
shot
database
with
the
woman's
name
they
were
able
to
get
an
address
and
the
fbi
and
officers
from
the
fairfax
county
police
department
gang
task
force
used
that
to
begin
keeping
tabs
on
her
the
arrest
on
aug
officers
from
the
task
force
called
stallings
and
said
they
were
heading
over
to
stake
out
the
woman's
residence
we
were
hoping
to
get
lucky
get
a
vehicle
get
something
else
to
put
a
building
block
together
with
stallings
said
and
so
they
went
down
there
sitting
on
it
and
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
get
this
call
back
from
their
sergeant
we
got
our
guy
the
surveillance
team
from
the
fairfax
county
gang
unit
had
followed
the
woman
to
a
gym
parking
lot
in
woodbridge
va
a
man
who
looked
like
gomez
walked
up
to
the
woman's
car
task
force
members
swooped
in
and
made
an
arrest
the
name
the
man
gave
was
jesus
lopez
centoreo
which
matched
the
fingerprints
on
file
but
we
knew
from
other
physical
identifiers
from
his
tattoos
from
the
picture
that
we
had
of
him
that
we
had
the
right
guy
stallings
said
he
says
the
officers
showed
the
man
the
most
wanted
poster
that
named
gomez
and
asked
whether
it
was
him
he
said
yes
so
he
self-identified
as
gomez
the
night
we
arrested
him
stallings
said
i
think
he
just
knew
that
it
was
done
he
knew
that
we
hadn't
made
a
mistake
in
identifying
him
and
putting
our
hands
on
him
and
making
the
arrest
we
had
done
our
corroboration
gomez
was
transferred
to
new
jersey
where
he
reached
a
deal
with
the
government
in
february
he
pleaded
guilty
to
one
count
of
racketeering
conspiracy
he
admitted
in
his
criminal
information
to
matute's
murder
last
month
a
federal
judge
sentenced
him
to
years
in
prison
