crossed

yet
registered

any
poll
during
the
qualifying
period
castro
is
the
only
latino
candidate
in
the
race
and
has
made
immigration
a
major
issue
including
his
push
to
decriminalize
illegal
border
crossings
which
he
heavily
pushed
in
the
first
debate
to
have
a
major
breakout
moment
and
a
skirmish
with
fellow
texan
o'rourke
he
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
that
in
order
to
curtail
border
crossings
he
advocates
boosting
federal
assistance
to
countries
such
as
guatemala
el
salvador
and
honduras
i
think
that
we're
always
going
to
have
people
coming
from
central
america
and
other
parts
of
the
world
he
said
do
we
need
people
in
one
month
coming
from
those
countries
that's
an
indication
that
something
is
wrong
in
those
countries
and
i
want
to
help
heal
that
