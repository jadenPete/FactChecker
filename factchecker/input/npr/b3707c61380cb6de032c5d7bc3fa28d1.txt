president
trump
arrives
for
a
news
conference
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
on
wednesday
a
tumultuous
week
in
washington
has
set
the
stage
for
an
intense
new
congressional
investigation
into
president
trump
and
what
could
prove
to
be
a
historic
clash
between
the
white
house
and
congress
the
outlines
are
now
clear
about
conduct
that
no
one
including
trump
disputes
the
president
asked
his
ukrainian
counterpart
to
investigate
the
family
of
vice
president
joe
biden
a
potential
political
rival
in
the
presidential
election
if
trump
was
sanguine
about
confirming
that
story
which
the
white
house
did
with
the
extraordinary
release
on
wednesday
of
its
own
records
about
the
conversation
house
democrats
want
the
answers
to
more
questions
before
they
decide
how
much
further
to
travel
down
a
road
they've
said
could
lead
to
impeachment
some
of
these
questions
were
raised
by
the
release
on
thursday
of
the
previously
secret
complaint
by
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower
that
sparked
the
ukraine
affair
in
that
document
the
complainant
suggests
that
intermediaries
told
ukrainian
officials
beforehand
that
a
phone
call
or
a
meeting
between
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
and
trump
would
depend
on
whether
zelenskiy
showed
willingness
to
play
ball
with
trump
i
do
not
know
who
delivered
this
message
to
the
ukrainian
leadership
or
when
the
whistleblower
added
house
democrats
want
to
learn
the
identities
of
those
people
and
where
their
communications
fit
into
the
story
although
trump
and
his
supporters
argue
that
the
white
house's
account
of
trump's
call
with
ukraine's
president
doesn't
record
a
quid
pro
quo
the
full
picture
has
not
been
made
clear
did
an
aide
or
a
diplomat
tell
kyiv
beforehand
that
u.s.
military
assistance
to
ukraine
was
being
suspended
as
it
was
in
the
summer
as
the
prelude
for
a
phone
call
in
which
trump
could
expect
zelenskiy
to
ask
for
it
to
resume
zelenskiy
did
just
that
according
to
the
white
house's
account
when
he
told
trump
that
ukraine
was
ready
to
continue
to
cooperate
to
buy
more
weapons
from
the
u.s.
that
prompted
trump
to
ask
him
for
a
favor
that
he
hoped
might
lead
to
information
about
the
biden
family
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
told
reporters
on
thursday
after
a
hearing
about
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
he
wants
to
learn
whom
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
has
talked
with
about
the
ukraine
affair
and
then
begin
seeking
witnesses
of
his
own
to
fill
out
the
story
inside
the
family
the
complaint
also
describes
a
practice
within
the
white
house
of
compartmentalizing
accounts
of
potentially
politically
sensitive
trump
calls
in
a
separate
close-hold
system
that
limits
access
even
within
the
administration
the
system
includes
records
of
other
presidential
transcripts
too
the
complaint
says
people
who've
served
in
the
white
house
in
past
administrations
have
said
that's
not
a
conventional
practice
when
did
it
begin
and
why
does
the
secret
system
described
in
the
complaint
actually
contain
records
about
other
presidential
phone
calls
with
foreign
leaders
that
resemble
trump's
talk
with
zelenskiy
what
did
trump
say
trump
has
vowed
to
be
transparent
about
the
ukraine
affair
he
volunteered
on
wednesday
to
release
records
about
two
other
phone
calls
with
ukrainian
leaders
involving
himself
and
vice
president
pence
trump
also
has
suggested
that
he
might
not
object
to
his
attorney
rudy
giuliani
speaking
with
congressional
committees
about
the
central
role
he
has
played
in
the
outreach
to
ukraine
but
if
past
is
prologue
the
white
house
may
not
be
eager
to
cooperate
much
more
with
what
trump
and
his
supporters
call
democrats
new
witch
hunt
the
administration
has
not
given
congress
documents
or
access
to
witnesses
in
response
to
many
of
its
earlier
requests
involving
the
russia
investigation
trump's
business
dealings
and
more
the
president's
supporters
have
dismissed
the
ukraine
flap
as
another
information
warfare
operation
against
the
president
meanwhile
some
of
the
disputes
between
the
house
and
the
administration
are
still
playing
out
in
court
after
committees
filed
suit
for
the
relevant
materials
what
isn't
clear
is
whether
the
theoretically
greater
stakes
of
the
ukraine
matter
which
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
democrats
have
made
the
focus
of
what
they
say
is
an
impeachment
inquiry
may
prompt
trump
to
change
his
tune
the
white
house
already
has
invoked
executive
privilege
the
doctrine
that
permits
an
administration
to
shield
some
of
its
internal
workings
from
public
view
in
keeping
some
witnesses
and
materials
from
congress
the
investigation
that
schiff
and
his
colleagues
now
want
to
pursue
involves
the
internal
workings
of
the
white
house
discussions
of
the
national
security
council
and
other
aides
diplomats
and
others
all
squarely
within
the
executive
branch
if
giuliani
who
has
been
working
for
trump
but
not
the
government
isn't
covered
by
executive
privilege
many
of
the
other
people
involved
may
be
executive
privilege
already
has
been
the
subject
of
internal
debates
involving
the
whistleblower
case
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
told
schiff's
committee
on
thursday
are
pelosi
and
schiff
about
to
drive
into
a
wall
they'll
be
unable
to
breach
or
will
the
putative
threat
of
impeachment
prompt
trump
to
open
the
gates
the
red
wall
trump
may
remain
confident
that
in
the
event
of
actual
impeachment
proceedings
which
would
involve
the
equivalent
of
an
indictment
in
the
house
and
then
lead
to
his
trial
in
the
senate
he'd
continue
to
enjoy
the
support
of
enough
republicans
to
retain
the
presidency
that
has
been
the
assumption
by
republicans
thus
far
and
as
washingtonians
headed
to
work
on
friday
morning
the
red
wall
in
the
senate
still
appeared
robust
at
times
the
president
and
his
supporters
have
appeared
to
want
to
dare
democrats
to
go
ahead
with
impeachment
with
the
knowledge
that
they
would
lose
betting
that
the
fallout
actually
would
wind
up
weakening
pelosi
and
her
members
and
strengthening
trump
and
republicans
before
this
week
pelosi
seemed
to
read
these
politics
in
the
same
way
and
sought
to
rein
in
the
most
aggressive
democrats
in
the
chamber
then
the
accounts
of
trump's
conduct
broke
the
dam
for
so
many
of
her
members
that
the
speaker
joined
them
on
tuesday
under
the
aegis
of
the
i-word
but
pelosi
also
hasn't
spelled
out
what
precisely
she
schiff
and
her
other
top
lieutenants
actually
may
do
differently
nor
has
she
made
clear
how
far
democrats
are
prepared
to
go
that
has
put
the
speaker
in
an
uncertain
new
standoff
with
the
president
and
the
next
phase
in
this
melodrama
may
depend
on
who's
the
first
one
to
blink
