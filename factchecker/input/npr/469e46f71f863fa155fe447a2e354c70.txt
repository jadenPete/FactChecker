the
whistleblower
complaint
released
thursday
charges
that
white
house
officials
attempted
to
limit
access
to
potentially
damaging
details
about
president
trump's
call
with
ukraine's
president
by
using
a
classified
system
reserved
for
highly
sensitive
information
if
this
allegation
is
true
former
national
security
council
officials
say
it
would
represent
a
highly
unusual
misuse
of
procedures
that
were
created
to
keep
america's
most
important
intelligence
secrets
safe
according
to
the
complaint
senior
white
house
officials
intervened
to
lock
down
records
of
the
july
call
between
trump
and
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
to
do
this
the
whistleblower
said
the
rough
transcript
was
loaded
into
an
electronic
system
meant
for
classified
information
of
an
especially
sensitive
nature
i
have
never
seen
it
done
in
my
time
in
the
white
house
and
i
doubt
that
other
presidents
have
engaged
in
this
although
you
never
know
what
happened
in
the
nixon
white
house
former
defense
secretary
leon
panetta
told
npr's
here
now
on
thursday
panetta
also
previously
served
as
the
director
of
the
cia
and
white
house
chief
of
staff
all
in
democratic
administrations
a
former
trump
nsc
official
confirmed
to
npr
that
the
trump
white
house
does
use
such
a
system
that
official
who
spoke
to
npr
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
about
four
to
six
people
in
the
white
house
likely
had
access
to
the
system
access
is
so
tightly
controlled
that
not
even
the
president's
national
security
adviser
can
input
or
retrieve
information
from
it
though
high-ranking
officials
could
direct
information
there
information
stored
in
the
system
is
shared
in
person
and
not
over
email
or
secure
phone
lines
the
only
reason
to
do
that
is
to
possibly
obstruct
justice
panetta
said
when
these
kinds
of
tapes
are
isolated
this
way
there
was
a
recognition
that
they
contained
possible
evidence
of
wrongdoing
i
had
never
heard
of
anything
like
that
said
ned
price
who
was
a
senior
director
for
strategic
communications
at
the
nsc
during
the
obama
administration
price
said
then-president
obama's
phone
calls
with
world
leaders
were
classified
but
they
weren't
stored
on
the
top-secret
system
another
former
nsc
official
michael
green
also
described
the
alleged
storage
of
the
rough
transcript
on
this
separate
system
as
deeply
disturbing
green
served
as
director
for
asia
at
the
nsc
between
and
when
george
w.
bush
was
president
remember
president
george
w.
bush
was
getting
phone
calls
after
during
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
green
said
and
so
even
in
that
context
i
had
never
heard
or
witnessed
what
we're
seeing
now
where
a
transcript
was
routed
directly
to
the
most
sensitive
compartmented
security
clearances
so
that
no
one
could
see
it
price
who
has
been
an
outspoken
critic
of
trump
said
the
type
of
information
typically
stored
on
this
system
would
be
related
to
intelligence
programs
or
activity
that
only
a
specific
set
of
people
in
the
u.s.
government
would
know
about
and
he
emphasized
that
it
wouldn't
be
the
kind
of
information
that
would
be
shared
with
a
foreign
leader
on
the
phone
the
fact
that
the
administration
was
able
to
release
the
rough
transcript
of
the
call
undercuts
the
notion
that
any
highly
secret
information
was
shared
price
argued
this
seems
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
abuse
of
the
classification
and
the
information
security
system
to
safeguard
not
the
information
but
to
effect
a
cover-up
he
said
the
whistleblower
complaint
also
says
that
the
whistleblower
was
told
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
presidential
transcript
had
been
treated
this
way
this
suggests
that
procedures
in
the
white
house
right
now
are
just
ad
hoc
and
that
national
security
law
and
national
security
procedures
are
being
used
in
an
ad
hoc
haphazard
and
highly
political
manner
green
said
the
white
house
declined
to
answer
questions
specifically
about
the
handling
of
this
transcript
but
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
has
defended
trump's
call
and
slammed
the
complaint
as
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
thirdhand
accounts
of
events
and
cobbled-together
press
clippings
all
of
which
shows
nothing
improper
kellyanne
conway
counselor
to
president
trump
told
reporters
she
was
not
familiar
with
nsc
procedures
regarding
these
transcripts
but
argued
that
what's
most
important
is
that
the
white
house
has
now
made
the
call
public
rep
kevin
mccarthy
the
top
republican
in
the
house
told
reporters
that
he
could
understand
why
the
white
house
might
want
to
use
a
more
secure
system
could
i
see
why
you'd
want
to
put
it
on
a
more
secure
server
mccarthy
asked
i
think
in
the
world
of
technology
today
yeah
people
should
secure
what's
going
forward
