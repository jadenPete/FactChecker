democrats
in
congress
say
their
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
trump
will
likely
take
weeks
not
months
of
work
updated
e.t.
sunday
the
rapidly
unfolding
ukraine
scandal
has
kicked
impeachment
investigations
into
high
gear
with
democratic
leaders
in
congress
now
saying
it
will
take
just
a
number
of
weeks
to
consolidate
findings
from
multiple
house
committees
this
is
not
going
to
require
months
and
months
and
months
of
hearings
says
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
who
spoke
with
npr
on
saturday
cicilline
holds
a
seat
on
the
judiciary
committee
which
would
bring
together
multiple
house
inquiries
and
then
decide
whether
to
formally
draw
up
articles
of
impeachment
the
issues
surrounding
president
trump's
contacts
with
ukraine
are
relatively
straightforward
and
easy
to
grasp
cicilline
says
particularly
when
compared
to
the
complexity
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
into
russian
interference
in
the
elections
unlike
the
mueller
report
where
we're
trying
to
piece
together
events
of
the
past
this
played
out
in
plain
view
and
real
time
to
the
american
people
cicilline
says
the
president
of
the
united
states
pressured
a
foreign
leader
to
target
a
political
opponent
to
help
him
in
his
reelection
and
then
tried
to
cover
it
up
on
sunday
rep
adam
schiff
said
on
abc's
this
week
that
the
whistleblower
at
the
center
of
the
impeachment
proceeding
has
agreed
to
testify
before
congress
which
he
said
will
happen
very
soon
schiff
said
that
precautions
are
now
being
finalized
to
protect
the
whistleblower's
identity
which
is
not
publicly
known
because
as
you
can
imagine
with
the
president
issuing
threats
like
we
ought
to
treat
these
people
who
expose
my
wrongdoing
as
we
used
to
treat
traitors
and
spies
and
we
used
to
execute
traitors
and
spies
you
can
imagine
the
security
concerns
here
schiff
said
congressional
republicans
have
dismissed
the
idea
that
president
trump's
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
involved
anything
improper
or
illegal
on
the
call
trump
urged
zelenskiy
to
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
a
leading
contender
for
the
democratic
nomination
and
his
son
hunter
biden's
son
has
come
under
attack
from
the
president
for
work
that
he
did
in
ukraine
for
the
energy
company
burisma
holdings
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
phone
call
that
rises
to
the
level
of
that
impeachment
sen
david
perdue
r-ga
told
the
associated
press
it's
just
the
president
being
president
trump
sen
ron
johnson
r-wis
told
the
ap
the
house
intelligence
committee
one
of
several
house
committees
handling
the
impeachment
inquiry
could
start
hearings
as
early
as
this
coming
week
its
work
will
focus
on
the
allegations
detailed
in
the
whistleblower
report
concerning
the
july
phone
call
and
conversations
between
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
who
has
met
with
ukrainian
officials
in
connection
with
the
president's
request
to
investigate
the
biden
family
giuliani
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
according
to
the
report
after
the
phone
call
between
trump
and
zelenskiy
white
house
officials
moved
to
lock
down
records
of
the
call
by
moving
a
rough
transcript
of
the
conversation
into
an
electronic
system
meant
for
classified
information
of
an
especially
sensitive
nature
on
friday
the
intelligence
committee
will
hold
a
closed
briefing
with
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
democrats
as
part
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
have
also
subpoenaed
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
for
documents
related
to
ukraine
meanwhile
multiple
house
committees
have
ongoing
investigations
into
other
aspects
of
the
trump
administration
such
as
alleged
financial
conflicts
of
interest
involving
his
hotels
and
other
businesses
the
expectation
cicilline
says
is
that
all
of
the
committees
that
have
been
doing
investigations
are
expected
to
kind
of
send
their
best
information
kind
of
the
conclusions
of
their
work
in
short
order
to
the
judiciary
committee
so
that
we
can
move
expeditiously
when
the
intelligence
committee
has
concluded
its
investigation
