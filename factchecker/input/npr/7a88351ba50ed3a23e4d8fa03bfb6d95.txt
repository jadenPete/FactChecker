former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
gave
a
staunch
defense
of
his
gun
control
plan
during
thursday's
democratic
presidential
primary
debate
saying
that
as
president
he
would
prioritize
mandatory
buybacks
of
assault-style
weapons
quoting
the
candidate's
past
comment
about
selling
back
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
moderator
david
muir
asked
o'rourke
are
you
proposing
taking
away
their
guns
and
how
would
this
work
o'rourke
answered
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
here's
more
of
what
he
said
the
response
drew
loud
applause
in
the
debate
hall
his
campaign
quickly
tweeted
to
promote
his
plan
and
ask
supporters
to
donate
to
his
campaign
americans
are
broadly
split
on
their
support
for
a
mandatory
buyback
program
of
assault-style
weapons
a
recent
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
found
that
of
americans
are
against
congress
passing
legislation
for
such
a
program
and
are
in
favor
and
the
divide
in
support
splits
along
partisan
lines
with
republicans
and
independent
voters
opposing
the
idea
more
striking
is
the
divide
between
women
and
men
of
women
think
congress
should
pass
legislation
creating
a
mandatory
buyback
program
and
of
men
are
against
it
there
is
more
consensus
on
other
initiatives
according
to
the
poll
such
as
laws
that
would
screen
for
the
types
of
people
who
could
use
a
gun
o'rourke's
campaign
has
taken
a
sharper
focus
since
a
gunman
killed
people
at
a
walmart
in
o'rourke's
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
last
month
his
plan
to
combat
gun
violence
links
guns
and
white
nationalism
and
he
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
last
month
that
law
enforcement's
top
priority
should
be
white
nationalism
and
white
supremacy
with
gun
violence
deaths
in
this
country
not
all
of
them
are
connected
to
white
nationalism
white
supremacy
or
white
terrorism
he
said
but
you
do
have
to
connect
the
hatred
the
racism
the
president's
words
and
actions
with
the
accessibility
of
those
weapons
that
afford
someone
the
means
to
conduct
this
kind
of
terror
in
this
country
