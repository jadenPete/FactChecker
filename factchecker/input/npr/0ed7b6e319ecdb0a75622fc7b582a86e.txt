questions
answered
about
the
rd
democratic
debate
heading
into
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
the
third
this
campaign
season
we
had
five
political
questions
here
are
those
questions
and
how
they
got
answered
there
weren't
tremendous
fireworks
between
the
two
former
vice
president
joe
biden
signaled
that
he'd
be
ready
to
go
after
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
he
took
a
couple
of
shots
at
her
especially
on
health
care
the
senator
says
she's
with
bernie
biden
said
referring
to
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
medicare
for
all
plan
which
would
replace
private
health
insurance
i'm
with
barack
the
health
care
focus
was
more
on
sanders
which
allowed
warren
to
skate
unscathed
and
that
was
largely
the
case
for
most
of
the
debate
it's
safe
to
say
if
biden
and
warren
continue
on
the
current
course
they
won't
be
able
to
avoid
each
other
so
easily
in
the
near
future
well
yes
this
was
biden's
best
debate
of
this
campaign
at
the
outset
he
was
the
crispest
he
has
been
biden
started
to
slip
some
in
the
last
hour
but
his
campaign
has
to
hope
that
fewer
people
were
watching
and
the
highlights
had
already
occurred
what
helped
him
was
that
the
debate
didn't
turn
into
a
pile-on
of
biden
again
because
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
decided
to
hug
the
moderate
lane
seeing
an
opening
to
do
so
remember
on
health
care
the
july
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
found
medicare
for
all
as
a
replacement
to
the
current
health
care
system
was
unpopular
as
an
option
however
it
was
far
more
popular
and
that
led
to
perhaps
a
surprising
split
onstage
with
biden
klobuchar
and
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
on
one
side
against
medicare
for
all
as
a
replacement
versus
sanders
and
warren
and
it
was
mostly
sanders
doing
the
defending
after
all
he
wrote
the
damn
bill
which
he
reminded
the
audience
again
not
so
much
many
candidates
were
more
careful
than
in
prior
debates
not
to
go
along
with
positions
popular
with
the
progressive
base
but
unpopular
with
the
general
electorate
they
were
also
much
more
gushing
about
the
tenure
of
former
president
barack
obama
they
have
up
to
this
point
largely
ceded
the
pro-obama
turf
to
biden
who
has
been
leading
in
the
polls
a
reminder
of
how
beloved
the
former
president
is
within
the
party
here
were
the
most
unpopular
candidate
positions
in
the
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
from
july
and
what
happened
with
them
in
the
debate
thursday
night
a
universal
basic
income
of
a
month
to
stave
off
the
effects
of
automation
good
idea
bad
idea
this
is
an
idea
exclusive
to
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
when
yang
offered
to
hold
a
competition
to
give
money
to
contestants
there
was
a
dismissive
laugh
from
california
sen
kamala
harris
and
a
side-eyed
dismissal
from
buttigieg
providing
reparations
for
slavery
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
forcefully
said
he
was
in
favor
of
reparations
but
his
was
the
only
mention
of
it
in
the
debate
previously
other
candidates
have
essentially
side-stepped
the
issue
mostly
saying
they're
in
favor
of
commissions
to
study
the
subject
decriminalizing
illegal
border
crossings
this
was
a
flashpoint
between
former
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
juli
n
castro
and
o'rourke
in
a
previous
debate
but
it
did
not
come
up
thursday
night
castro
touted
that
he
would
get
a
comprehensive
immigration
overhaul
bill
done
in
his
first
days
and
warren
noted
that
she
wanted
a
path
to
citizenship
that
is
fair
and
achievable
that
position
is
much
more
popular
said
it
was
a
good
idea
to
provide
a
path
to
citizenship
for
people
in
the
u.s.
illegally
health
insurance
for
immigrants
in
the
u.s.
illegally
this
was
another
flashpoint
in
an
earlier
debate
but
not
thursday
instead
mentioned
more
often
were
dreamers
people
who
were
brought
to
the
u.s.
illegally
as
children
giving
them
citizenship
is
a
far
more
popular
policy
issue
than
health
insurance
for
those
in
the
country
illegally
warren
and
o'rourke
did
argue
for
dreamers
relatives
to
also
get
citizenship
but
it's
not
clear
whether
that's
popular
with
voters
abolishing
the
death
penalty
this
didn't
come
up
thursday
night
criminal
justice
reform
yes
something
president
trump
has
pursued
the
death
penalty
no
medicare
for
all
as
a
replacement
to
the
current
health
care
system
this
was
the
major
subject
of
the
night
nothing
creates
a
debate
within
the
democratic
party
quite
like
health
care
that's
because
it
routinely
ranks
as
the
top
issue
for
democrats
and
their
candidates
have
given
it
quite
a
bit
of
thought
over
the
years
if
the
individual
mandate
was
the
health
care
debate
point
of
the
campaign
between
barack
obama
and
hillary
clinton
medicare
for
all
is
this
year's
and
as
noted
earlier
sanders
and
warren
were
left
on
their
own
to
defend
it
mostly
from
biden
klobuchar
and
buttigieg
by
the
way
medicare
for
all
as
an
option
rather
than
replacement
is
far
more
popular
of
americans
think
it's
a
good
idea
what
about
guns
klobuchar
noted
that
everyone
on
the
stage
is
in
favor
of
an
assault-style
weapons
ban
that
is
a
remarkable
thing
considering
just
how
controversial
it
is
in
public
debate
but
the
latest
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
found
a
ban
fairly
popular
overall
want
congress
to
pass
it
but
only
a
small
minority
of
republicans
sanders
biden
and
warren
raise
their
hands
during
the
debate
win

caption
yes
sanders
and
warren
did
not
go
after
each
other
but
notably
sanders
was
under
fire
from
biden
and
others
who
used
his
professed
democratic
socialism
as
a
foil
to
paint
sanders
and
his
policies
as
extreme
that
allowed
warren
to
use
sanders
as
something
of
a
heat
shield
sanders
seemed
irked
by
it
all
one
wonders
whether
the
detente
shall
hold
if
warren's
numbers
continue
to
rise
and
surpass
sanders
if
prior
debates
saw
candidates
cautious
in
the
kinds
of
chances
they
would
take
thursday
night
saw
lower-polling
candidates
take
more
risks
and
throw
more
hail
marys
yang
tried
his
competition
stunt
klobuchar
went
for
broke
in
the
moderate
lane
o'rourke
who
was
in
full
reboot
mode
of
his
candidacy
said
he
is
in
favor
of
reparations
for
african
americans
as
recompense
for
slavery
called
trump
a
white
supremacist
and
added
hell
yes
when
asked
whether
he
is
going
to
take
away
assault-style
weapons
as
president
castro
forcefully
went
after
biden
and
took
a
big
risk
accusing
him
of
forgetting
what
he
said
earlier
four
different
times
something
that
to
many
looked
and
sounded
like
an
assault
on
the
year-old
biden's
mental
acuity
castro
argued
after
the
debate
that
he
was
right
on
the
merits
but
the
approach
left
a
sour
taste
for
many
who
saw
it
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
said
flatly
that
trump
is
a
racist
and
called
for
an
office
in
the
white
house
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
white
supremacy
and
hate
crimes
so
will
any
of
that
work
for
what
it's
worth
klobuchar
and
booker
seemed
to
deliver
good
performances
and
o'rourke
made
a
mark
standing
out
more
than
in
the
first
two
debates
there
doesn't
however
seem
to
be
much
evidence
from
thursday
night's
debate
to
suggest
that
the
shape
of
the
race
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
was
altered
in
any
fundamental
fashion
