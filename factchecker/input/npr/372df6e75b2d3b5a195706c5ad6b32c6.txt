updated
at
p
m
et
the
trump
administration
has
announced
it
is
ending
a
federal
court
agreement
that
limits
how
long
migrant
families
with
children
can
be
detained
acting
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
outlined
the
new
policy
wednesday
which
replaces
the
flores
settlement
agreement
that's
been
a
longtime
target
of
immigration
hard-liners
in
the
trump
administration
who
contend
the
settlement
has
acted
as
a
lure
to
families
in
central
america
the
new
policy
means
that
migrant
families
who
are
detained
after
crossing
the
border
can
be
kept
indefinitely
until
their
cases
are
decided
today's
policy
doesn't
specify
a
limit
but
sets
an
expectation
that
cases
be
resolved
comparatively
quickly
within
about
two
months
asked
about
the
new
policy
president
trump
told
reporters
on
wednesday
that
very
much
i
have
the
children
on
my
mind
it
bothers
me
very
greatly
he
added
that
the
new
policy
along
with
upgrades
to
border
barriers
will
mean
migrant
families
won't
attempt
to
travel
to
the
united
states
and
that
many
people
will
be
saved
the
american
psychological
association
was
sharply
critical
of
the
new
rule
in
a
statement
it
said
that
the
large
majority
of
these
children
have
already
experienced
trauma
before
arriving
at
immigration
facilities
and
the
longer
they
are
held
in
detention
the
more
likely
their
mental
health
will
continue
to
suffer
mcaleenan
said
the
new
policy
would
take
effect
days
after
it
is
published
on
friday
and
that
it
would
deter
what
he
called
a
catch
and
release
loophole
in
which
families
are
arrested
and
quickly
released
into
the
united
states
while
their
cases
are
adjudicated
he
also
conceded
it
is
certain
to
be
challenged
in
court
moments
after
mcaleenan
made
his
announcement
madhuri
grewal
a
policy
counsel
with
the
american
civil
liberties
union
called
the
new
policy
yet
another
cruel
attack
on
children
who
the
trump
administration
has
targeted
again
and
again
with
its
anti-immigrant
policies
congress
must
not
fund
this
cornell
university
law
school
professor
stephen
yale-loehr
said
that
courts
will
probably
block
implementation
of
the
rule
federal
courts
have
struck
down
almost
every
effort
this
administration
has
made
to
curtail
the
rights
of
immigrants
he
said
in
a
statement
when
will
president
trump
realize
that
immigrants
in
the
u.s.
have
due
process
rights
mcaleenan
said
under
the
new
rule
all
children
in
the
government's
care
will
be
universally
treated
with
dignity
respect
and
special
concern
in
concert
with
american
values
and
faithful
to
the
intent
of
the
original
settlement
he
said
detained
families
will
be
held
at
facilities
such
as
one
in
pennsylvania
that
he
described
as
a
campus-like
setting
with
cushioned
couches
and
recreation
facilities
where
families
are
given
three
hot
meals
a
day
but
those
facilities
are
already
near
capacity
and
critics
fear
families
could
be
held
in
detention
camps
similar
to
those
near
the
border
in
which
children
have
been
forced
to
sleep
on
pads
on
concrete
floors
with
scant
medical
attention
the
latest
trump
administration
attempt
to
limit
illegal
migration
follows
a
week
after
it
announced
steps
to
limit
legal
migration
including
a
declaration
that
by
seeking
government
benefits
migrants
would
jeopardize
their
chances
of
becoming
permanent
residents
