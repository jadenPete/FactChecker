former
vice
president
joe
biden
takes
the
stage
thursday
at
the
third
democratic
debate
which
took
place
at
texas
southern
university
in
houston
more
than
years
after
the
u.s.
invasion
of
iraq
former
vice
president
joe
biden
is
still
struggling
to
explain
his
vote
for
the
war
and
when
his
feelings
about
intervention
evolved
on
thursday
night
during
the
third
democratic
debate
which
took
place
in
houston
biden
said
he
never
should
have
voted
to
give
president
bush
the
authority
to
go
in
and
do
what
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
biden
a
former
delaware
senator
was
referring
to
his
october
vote
in
the
u.s.
senate
for
the
authorization
to
use
military
force
against
iraq
and
his
comments
were
not
prompted
by
a
moderator's
question
it
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
clarify
his
record
after
recently
receiving
criticism
for
mischaracterizing
his
opposition
to
the
war
i
said
something
that
was
not
meant
the
way
i
said
it
biden
said
further
trying
to
clarify
himself
on
the
debate
stage
his
comments
were
referring
to
remarks
he
made
both
during
the
last
debate
and
in
a
recent
npr
politics
podcast
interview
in
which
he
said
he
declared
his
opposition
to
the
war
from
the
outset
biden
went
on
to
explain
that
what
he
meant
was
that
he
had
argued
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
the
u.s.
was
engaging
in
iraq
the
wrong
way
there
was
no
plan
and
no
support
from
allies
although
biden
voted
for
the
authorization
to
use
military
force
against
iraq
he
has
suggested
that
he
was
misled
by
george
w.
bush's
administration
he
told
npr
last
week
that
he
thought
the
vote
would
be
used
as
diplomatic
leverage
bush
looked
me
in
the
eye
in
the
oval
office
he
said
he
needed
the
vote
to
be
able
to
get
inspectors
into
iraq
to
determine
whether
or
not
saddam
hussein
was
engaged
in
dealing
with
a
nuclear
program
biden
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
he
got
them
in
and
before
you
know
it
we
had
shock
and
awe
bush's
office
denied
biden's
version
of
events
i'm
sure
it's
just
an
innocent
mistake
of
memory
but
this
recollection
is
flat
wrong
said
spokesman
freddy
ford
in
an
email
to
npr
the
biden
campaign
pointed
to
numerous
remarks
from
bush
at
the
time
in
which
he
said
he
hoped
to
go
through
the
u.n.
security
council
to
avoid
a
military
conflict
with
iraq
but
regardless
of
whether
there
was
outright
deception
or
just
two
politicians
recalling
different
versions
of
history
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
former
vice
president's
position
has
evolved
over
the
years
though
it's
unclear
when
and
how
exactly
that
occurred
in
recent
months
biden
has
suggested
he
was
a
staunch
critic
of
the
war
from
the
beginning
he
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
that
immediately
that
moment
it
started
i
came
out
against
the
war
at
that
moment
he
made
a
similar
claim
during
the
second
democratic
debates
from
the
moment
shock
and
awe
started
from
that
moment
i
was
opposed
to
the
effort
and
i
was
outspoken
as
much
as
anyone
at
all
in
the
congress
and
the
administration
he
said
but
in
multiple
public
remarks
made
after
the
invasion
began
in
biden
openly
supported
the
effort
nine
months
ago
i
voted
with
my
colleagues
to
give
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
authority
to
use
force
and
i
would
vote
that
way
again
today
biden
said
in
a
speech
at
the
brookings
institution
on
july
it
was
a
right
vote
then
and
it'll
be
a
correct
vote
today
it
wasn't
until
in
an
interview
on
meet
the
press
that
biden
publicly
said
his
vote
was
a
mistake
tony
blinken
a
senior
campaign
adviser
to
biden
who
previously
served
as
the
democratic
staff
director
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
when
the
iraq
war
began
insisted
that
the
former
vice
president
was
highly
critical
of
the
bush
administration's
strategy
and
intelligence
failures
from
the
outset
but
that
once
the
u.s.
military
was
deployed
biden
supported
resources
for
the
troops
in
a
statement
to
the
washington
post
he
said
in
part
vice
president
biden
misspoke
by
saying
that
he
declared
his
opposition
to
the
war
immediately
he
opposed
the
way
we
went
to
war
and
the
way
the
war
was
being
carried
out
he
has
for
many
years
called
his
vote
a
mistake
and
takes
full
responsibility
for
it
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
voted
against
the
iraq
war
and
made
sure
to
remind
biden
of
that
on
thursday
night
i
never
believed
what
cheney
and
bush
said
about
iraq
he
said
pointing
out
that
he
led
the
opposition
to
the
war
knowing
there
was
bound
to
be
massive
destabilization
in
iraq
