former
georgia
gubernatorial
candidate
stacey
abrams
is
launching
fair
fight
which
aims
to
enfranchise
voters
across
the
country
stacey
abrams
is
not
running
for
president
and
says
she
will
instead
focus
on
extending
voter
protection
programs
throughout
the
country
the
georgia
democrat
whose
race
for
governor
drew
national
attention
says
she
aims
to
enfranchise
voters
across
states
with
an
initiative
called
fair
fight
there
are
only
two
things
stopping
us
in
making
sure
people
have
a
reason
to
vote
and
that
they
have
the
right
to
vote
abrams
said
in
announcing
the
initiative
at
the
international
union
of
painters
and
allied
trades
convention
in
las
vegas
on
tuesday
lauren
groh-wargo
chief
executive
of
fair
fight
cited
unprecedented
voter
suppression
mainly
targeted
at
communities
of
color
but
also
at
students
and
low-income
folks
across
this
country
our
democratic
presidential
nominee
our
u.s.
senate
nominees
and
our
down
ballot
democrats
next
year
are
going
to
need
unprecedented
support
ensuring
that
voters
are
able
to
cast
their
ballot
without
issue
or
incident
she
said
last
year
abrams
lost
georgia's
gubernatorial
race
to
the
republican
candidate
brian
kemp
who
was
also
overseeing
the
election
as
secretary
of
state
voting
rights
was
a
central
issue
in
the
campaign
a
report
by
the
associated
press
said
that
under
an
exact
match
law
kemp
had
stalled
more
than
voter
registrations
by
mostly
black
voters
the
ap
also
reported
that
through
a
process
kemp
calls
voter
roll
maintenance
his
office
has
cancelled
over
million
voter
registrations
since
and
that
nearly
registrations
were
cancelled
in
alone
kemp
has
vehemently
denied
that
he
attempted
to
disenfranchise
voters
in
georgia
but
groh-wargo
calls
him
one
of
the
most
aggressive
architects
of
voter
suppression
in
the
country
she
says
fair
fight
will
be
working
with
local
partners
throughout
the
u.s.
to
prevent
voter
suppression
the
group
is
collaborating
with
state
democratic
parties
to
organize
and
place
volunteer
observers
at
polling
locations
groh-wargo
says
it
will
help
fund
those
operations
including
hiring
voter
protection
directors
and
additional
staff
as
well
as
hotlines
to
field
voter
questions
erica
peresman
the
voter
protection
director
for
the
michigan
democratic
party
says
she's
eager
to
work
with
fair
fight
and
that
their
collaboration
will
help
ensure
every
eligible
voter
gets
to
cast
a
ballot
that
counts
michigan
recently
passed
a
measure
which
allows
any
registered
voter
to
request
an
absentee
ballot
fair
fight
can
now
help
us
figure
out
how
do
we
make
sure
that
all
of
those
absentee
ballots
are
getting
counted
peresman
says
fair
fight
says
it
has
been
working
quietly
for
many
months
with
democratic
leaders
in
georgia
and
other
states
to
build
out
voter
protection
operations
groh-wargo
says
the
group's
goal
is
have
these
operations
in
place
this
year
so
that
they
can
begin
scaling
the
effort
for
the
presidential
election
