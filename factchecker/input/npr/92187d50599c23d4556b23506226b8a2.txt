a

is
working

self-induced

both
in

and
over
the

when
arlen
found
out
she
was
pregnant
this
year
she
was
still
finishing
college
and
knew
she
didn't
want
a
child
there's
a
clinic
near
her
home
but
arlen
faced
other
obstacles
to
getting
an
abortion
i
started
researching
about
prices
and
i
was
like
well
i
don't
have
said
arlen
who
is
in
her
s
and
lives
in
el
paso
texas
we're
not
using
her
full
name
to
protect
her
privacy
so
i
was
like
ok
there's
gotta
be
other
ways
her
research
led
her
to
information
about
self-induced
abortion
using
pills
for
me
it
was
like
taking
my
power
back
like
i'm
going
to
do
this
some
way
or
another
arlen
said
i
don't
want
silly
people
and
the
government
making
silly
laws
abortion
using
pills
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
an
approved
two-drug
protocol
for
medication
abortions
a
combination
of
misoprostol
and
mifepristone
mifepristone
is
especially
heavily
regulated
in
the
u.s.
and
the
combination
is
typically
prescribed
by
a
doctor
during
the
first
weeks
of
pregnancy
to
cause
what's
essentially
a
medically
induced
miscarriage
that
two-drug
combination
is
most
effective
but
the
world
health
organization
says
misoprostol
alone
can
also
be
used
to
safely
induce
abortion
provided
patients
get
follow-up
care
arlen
learned
online
that
she
could
get
misoprostol
sold
to
treat
ulcers
at
a
pharmacy
across
the
border
in
ju
rez
mexico
even
my
friend
that
was
with
me
she
was
kind
of
shocked
about
how
easy
it
was
she
said
arlen
didn't
want
to
take
the
pills
alone
so
back
in
el
paso
she
went
to
a
friend's
home
and
followed
instructions
in
a
manual
she'd
found
online
after
a
lot
of
cramping
and
some
vomiting
she
said
she'd
passed
both
blood
and
tissue
within
several
hours
the
first
time
i
saw
blood
i
was
so
relieved
arlen
said
because
i
wasn't
happy
about
it
but
i
was
just
like
ah
it
worked
at
a
time
when
getting
an
abortion
at
a
clinic
is
becoming
more
difficult
in
many
places

we

landeau

the

missouri
is
among

missouri's

self-induced

used
to
be
seen
as
dangerous
and
taboo
reproductive

advocates
often
have
raised
the
specter
of
back-alley
procedures
or
women
using
grisly
dangerous
methods
such
as
a
coat
hanger
to
end
a

at

but
landeau
said
people
seeking
abortions
now
even
in
a
restrictive
environment
are
living
in
a
different
world
than
before
when
the
roe
v
wade
decision
legalized
abortion
nationwide
the
days
of
coat
hangers
and
dying
on
the
floor
of
a
hotel
room
the
internet
has
happened
since
them
and
a
lot
of
advances
in
medical
science
have
happened
since
then
she
said
so
it's
not
going
to
look
the
same
as
it
did
pre-roe
self-induced
abortion
isn't
new
women
have
always
found
ways
to
end
unwanted
pregnancies
though
not
always
safely
but
interest
in
information
about
the
practice
appears
to
be
growing
though
data
on
how
common
it
is
are
limited
it's
difficult
to
collect
data
on
self-managed
abortion
precisely
because
it's
self-managed
said
megan
donovan
senior
policy
manager
at
the
guttmacher
institute
which
supports
abortion
rights
and
there's
no
easy
way
of
identifying
or
tracking

doing
it
and
where
or
when
a
new

from

they

help

is
training

to

she
said
one
project
that
focuses
on
self-induced
abortion
has
seen
its
web
traffic
spike
in
the
past
couple
of
years
especially
around
the
time
of
the
confirmation
of
president's
trump's
most
recent
supreme
court
nominee
there
was
a
huge
jump
during
the
kavanaugh
hearings
when
i
think
people
started
to
really
realize
that
access
to
clinic-based
abortion
might
be
going
away
in
many
places
yanow
said
there
has
been
steady
growth
even
since
last
summer
when
those
hearings
were
taking
place
bypassing
doctors
going
online
for
women
who
can't

the
internet
is
reshaping
their
options

and
stay-at-home
mom
in
roanoke
va
who
asked
us
to
call
her
by
her
first
initial
s.
said
she
ordered
abortion
pills
online
without
seeing
a
doctor
about
three
years
ago
through
a
pharmacy
based
outside
the
united
states
s.
said
she
could
have
gone
to
a
clinic
in
her
area
but
she
didn't
want
to
wait
weeks
for
an
appointment
like
she
had
for
a
previous
medication
abortion
with
a
credit
card
she
said
it
showed
up
within
two
weeks
so
by
five
weeks
pregnant
i
was
able
to
take
the
pills
and
start
the
abortion
s.
went
with
a
two-drug
combination
she
was
able
to
get
online
it's
not
the
one
preferred
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
because
it's
less
effective
but
s.
said
it
worked
for
her
still
she
had
some
fears
about
taking
the
pills
herself
i
couldn't
get
it
out
of
my
head
what
if
this
happens
what
if
this
happens
and
i
leave
my
children
on
their
own
she
said
s.
said
she
had
a
plan
to
call
an
ambulance
or
go
to
a
nearby
hospital
if
she
had
any
complications
medical
research
and
risks
an
emergency
backup
plan
is
critical
for
anyone
thinking
of
self-inducing
said
daniel
grossman
an
ob-gyn
and
reproductive
health
researcher
at
the
university
of
california
san
francisco
he
said
self-induced
abortion
can
be
safe
if
done
correctly
the
bottom
line
is
i
don't
have
serious
medical
concerns
about
the
safety
of
people
self-managing
an
abortion
on
their
own
if
they
have
information
about
evidence-based
regimens
about
how
to
use
these
medications
grossman
said
if
they
know
for
example
that
it's
important
to
know
how
far
along
they
are
in
their
pregnancy
they
know
how
to
take
the
medications
and
if
they
have
access
to
backup
care
in
case
of
a
rare
complication
another
concern
about
ordering
pills
online
is
ensuring
that
the
drugs
are
of
high
quality
and
labeled
correctly
an
organization
called
plan
c
has
been
purchasing
and
testing
the
quality
of
abortion
medications
available
on
the
internet
elisa
wells
the
group's
co-founder
said
she
wants
abortion
pills
to
become
more
available
through
mainstream
channels
in
the
united
states
in
the
interim
we
know
that
people
are
already
doing
this
through
online
purchasing
wells
said
and
we
want
to
make
sure
they
have
the
information
that
they
need
to
do
that
safely
and
effectively
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
has
no
official
position
on
the
safety
of
self-induced
abortion
but
the
group
opposes
the
criminalization
of
it
and
says
the
fda-approved
protocol
for
medication
abortion
in
early
pregnancy
is
safe
and
effective
ingrid
skop
an
ob-gyn
in
san
antonio
and
the
chair-elect
of
the
american
association
of
pro-life
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
is
morally
opposed
to
abortion
she
also
worries
that
some
women
may
not
be
able
to
self-induce
safely
if
a
woman
is
further
along
in
the
pregnancy
than
she
realizes
and
that
happens
frequently
we
change
due
dates
a
lot
because
maybe
she
has
irregular
periods
or
she
just
wasn't
paying
attention
skop
said
the
failure
rate
is
much
much
higher
abortion
pills
are
less
likely
to
be
effective
as
a
pregnancy
progresses
skop
also
points
to
a
recent
study
in
the
reproductive
health
journal
contraception
in
which
about
half
of
reproductive
health
care
providers
surveyed
thought
self-induced
abortion
was
safe
the
fear
of
prosecution
there
are
also
legal
concerns
abortion
rights
advocates
worry
that
women
like

the

not

it

senior
counsel
for

how
a
legal
advocacy
group
that
advises
patients
on
reproductive
rights
issues
including
self-induced
abortion
she
notes
that
many
americans
order
a
range
of
prescription
drugs
online
already
she
said
she
advises
patients
that
abortion
drugs
are
not
extra
illegal
this
is
just
a
function
of
our
broken
health
care
system
and
so
abortion
pills
are
a
very
small
part
of
that
diaz-tello
said
even
though
it's
not
considered
legal
when
people
order
their
medications
online
without
a
prescription
they
in
general
are
not
punished
for
it
the
fear
of
prosecution
is
real
if
a
bit
premature
said
mary
ziegler
a
law
professor
at
florida
state
university
some
states
prohibit
self-inducing
abortions
but
ziegler
said
prosecutors
often
have
been
reluctant
to
press
charges
because
i
think
from
a
standpoint
of
politics
and
optics
it's
a
disastrously
bad
idea
for
pro-lifers
to
prosecute
women
she
said
but
ziegler
said
it
has
happened
and
she
can
imagine
more
of
that
happening
in
the
future
already
this
year
the
fda
has
issued
a
warning
letter
to
a
european
physician
who
prescribes
abortion
pills
to
american
women
over
the
internet
through
an
organization
called
aid
access
it
accused
the
organization
of
violating
federal
law
and
raised
concerns
about
the
safety
of
providing
mifepristone
and
misoprostol
over
the
internet
a
recently
published
study
in
contraception
found
that
when
supervised
by
a
remote
health
care
provider
the
two-drug
combination
can
be
safely
and
effectively
dispensed
through
telemedicine
the
doctor
rebecca
gomperts
has
sued
the
fda
and
her
lawyer
told
npr
he
is
concerned
that
both
she
and
her
patients
could
face
prosecution
if
new
state
laws
restricting
abortion
are
upheld
clinics
are
likely
to
close
ziegler
said
that
would
leave
women
in
those
states
with
few
options
for
ending
unwanted
pregnancies
and
state
officials
may
feel
pressure
to
prosecute
them
there's
gonna
be
i
think
really
extreme
pressure
on
legislatures
in
georgia
and
alabama
to
prosecute
women
ziegler
said
simply
because
women
in
many
of
these
cases
would
be
the
only
people
you
could
prosecute
if
you
wanted
to
enforce
the
law
ziegler
said
the
next
phase
of
the
battle
over
abortion
rights
could
be
focused
less
on
clinics
and
more
on
the
patients
who
seek
or
self-induce
abortions
