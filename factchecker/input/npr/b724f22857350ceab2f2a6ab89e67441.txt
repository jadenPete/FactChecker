deepfakes

digitally

that

not
such
altered
files
could
have
broad
implications
for

security
experts
have
warned
about
the
prospect
of
a
new
era
of
high
quality
faked
video
or
audio
which
some
commentators
worry
could
have
deeply
corrosive
effects
on
u.s.
democracy
here's
what
you
need
to
know
what
are
deepfakes
that's
the
nickname
given
to
computer-created
artificial
videos
or
other
digital
material
in
which
images
are
combined
to
create
new
footage
that
depicts
events
that
never
actually
happened
the
term
originates
from
the
online
message
board
reddit
one
initial
use
of
the
fake
videos
was
in
amateur-created
pornography
in
which
the
faces
of
famous
hollywood
actresses
were
digitally
placed
onto
that
of
other
performers
to
make
it
appear
as
though
the
stars
themselves
were
performing
members
of
congress
and
security
specialists
have
warned
that
the
quality
of
these
software-created
fakes
is
improving
significantly
one
concern
is
that
they
could
be
used
as
part
of
an
influence
campaign
and
fool
significant
numbers
of
people
especially
at
a
critical
time
in
an
election
cycle
into
believing
something
had
happened
that
really
hadn't
a
related
phenomenon
might
also
bring
a
big
change
to
american
politics
the
profusion
of
fake
material
also
means
politicians
could
try
to
deny
things
that
really
did
happen
how
difficult
is
it
to
create
fake
media
it
can
be
done
with
specialized
software
experts
say
the
same
way
that
editing
programs
such
as
photoshop
have
made
it
simpler
to
manipulate
still
images
and
specialized
software
itself
isn't
necessary
for
what
have
been
dubbed
shallow
fakes
or
cheap
fakes
in
the
spring
of
a
doctored
video
appeared
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
that
had
been
adapted
from
a
real
one
the
manipulated
video
was
slowed
so
that
pelosi
appeared
to
be
disoriented
and
slurring
her
words
can
fakes
be
detected
yes
although
usually
not
until
after
some
time
has
passed
since
they've
appeared
observers
noticed
that
the
doctored
pelosi
video
was
a
copy
of
a
real
video
and
news
organizations
played
them
side
by
side
researchers
also
say
they
are
working
on
new
ways
to
speed
up
systems
aimed
at
helping
establish
when
video
or
audio
has
been
manipulated
but
it's
been
called
a
cat
and
mouse
game
in
which
there
may
seldom
be
exact
parity
between
fabrication
and
detection
one
important
question
at
any
given
moment
in
the
elections
context
is
how
much
time
it
takes
for
detection
to
catch
up
with
circulation
why
is
the
timing
so
important
imagine
it's
the
night
before
a
big
debate
or
election
day
itself
suddenly
a
video
is
everywhere
that
appears
to
show
a
candidate
saying
something
outrageous
or
engaged
in
some
kind
of
inappropriate
conduct
if
the
veracity
of
that
material
is
unclear
for
the
succeeding
or
hours
or
more
that
could
have
an
effect
on
voters
attitudes
or
imagine
the
mirror
image
of
this
scenario
suppose
the
clip
appears
and
what
it
depicts
is
real
but
the
candidate
involved
denies
what
it
contains
and
says
it's
a
fake
citing
all
the
discussion
about
fabricated
media
other
evidence
might
emerge
proving
that
the
activity
in
the
video
or
audio
was
real
but
what
if
all
the
facts
weren't
sorted
until
hours
or
days
later
is
this
problem
only
about
fake
video
or
audio
no
some
americans
already
have
been
taken
in
by
things
they
read
online
in
simple
text
and
in
people
were
contacted
by
russian
government
influence
specialists
posing
as
american
campaign
volunteers
they
organized
real-life
political
rallies
and
took
part
in
online
conversations
all
while
posing
as
voters
and
activists
thinking
bigger
specialists
also
warn
about
an
even
larger-scale
disruption
than
a
video
or
audio
clip
david
doermann
of
the
state
university
of
new
york
at
buffalo
told
the
house
intelligence
committee
in
june
that
when
he
worked
for
the
pentagon's
research
agency
he
worried
about
the
creation
of
a
whole
false
storyline
one
thing
that
kept
me
up
at
night
was
the
concern
that
someday
our
adversaries
would
be
able
to
create
entire
events
with
minimal
effort
doermann
said
these
events
might
include
images
of
scenes
from
different
angles
video
content
that
appears
from
different
devices
and
text
that
is
delivered
through
various
mediums
providing
an
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
that
an
event
has
occurred
and
this
could
lead
to
social
unrest
or
retaliation
before
it
gets
countered
for
example
imagine
reports
about
a
terrorist
attack
in
a
sensitive
area
at
a
sensitive
time
complete
with
different
perspectives
and
what
appear
to
be
real
posts
about
it
in
real
time
on
twitter
or
another
social
network
an
adversary
might
want
to
try
to
make
americans
act
or
not
act
to
serve
its
own
ends
what
is
the
government
doing
law
enforcement
and
national
security
officials
say
they're
working
seriously
to
defend
the
election
against
interference
but
so
many
of
the
solutions
to
fake
media
can
only
be
applied
after
it
appears
at
least
one
state
has
considered
legislation
that
would
outlaw
distributing
election-oriented
fake
videos
experts
have
suggested
that
social
networks
must
be
held
accountable
for
hosting
fake
materials
in
order
to
create
incentives
for
them
to
police
themselves
others
told
congress
that
americans
must
learn
more
about
fakes
and
the
peril
they
can
pose
but
as
danielle
citron
of
boston
university
law
school
told
the
house
intelligence
committee
no
single
key
will
unlock
the
problem
i
feel
like
our
panel
is
going
to
be
in
heated
agreement
that
there
is
no
silver
bullet
she
said
we
need
a
combination
of
law
markets
and
really
societal
resilience
to
get
through
this
