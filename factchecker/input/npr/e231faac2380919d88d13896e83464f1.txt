the
bill's
co-author
police
officers
in
california
will
be
required
to
use
lethal
force
only
as
a
necessary
response
to
a
threat
not
merely
as
an
objectively
reasonable
one
under
legislation
that
gov
gavin
newsom
signed
into
law
monday
under
the
tighter
standard
deadly
force
is
legal
only
in
instances
where
there
are
no
other
options
i'm
ready
to
sign
this
damn
thing
newsom
told
the
crowd
at
a
ceremony
in
sacramento
but
before
he
did
so
he
invited
the
family
members
and
loved
ones
of
people
who
advocated
for
the
measure
to
stand
alongside
him
i
would
be
honored
if
you
would
join
us
up
onstage
newsom
said
surrounded
by
dozens
of
people
the
governor
said
he
hopes
the
law
which
takes
effect
in
january
will
become
an
example
for
other
states
as
california
goes
so
goes
the
rest
of
the
united
states
of
america
he
said
and
we
are
doing
something
today
that
stretches
the
boundaries
of
possibility
and
sends
a
message
to
people
all
across
this
country
that
they
can
do
more
the
legislation
emerged
from
a
push
for
new
rules
in
response
to
police
killings
of
unarmed
black
men
such
as
stephon
clark
who
was
shot
last
year
after
a
police
chase
that
ended
in
his
grandmother's
backyard
the
officers
in
that
shooting
said
they
believed
clark
had
a
gun
he
was
found
to
have
been
holding
a
cellphone
and
prosecutors
said
in
march
that
the
officers
would
not
face
criminal
charges
the
new
law
reflects
a
compromise
between
civil
rights
advocates
who
say
it
will
save
lives
and
law
enforcement
groups
that
want
more
clarity
on
the
use
of
force
but
do
not
want
to
undermine
legal
protections
for
officers
the
whole
debate
boils
down
to
two
words
necessary
and
reasonable
ben
adler
of
capital
public
radio
reports
right
now
deadly
force
is
justified
if
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
acted
similarly
in
that
situation
so
in
other
words
what
a
typical
officer
would
have
done
based
on
his
or
her
training
when
the
law
takes
effect
in
january
that
standard
will
change
to
when
the
officer
reasonably
believes
deadly
force
is
necessary
but
adler
also
notes
that
the
law
mostly
avoids
offering
a
specific
definition
of
necessary
a
move
that
is
widely
seen
as
leaving
the
interpretation
up
to
the
courts
where
judges
will
weigh
what
is
necessary
in
the
context
of
officers
use
of
force
assemblywoman
shirley
weber
d-san
diego
is
widely
seen
as
the
driving
force
behind
the
bill
ab
in
promoting
it
she
has
said
it
will
boost
the
public's
trust
in
the
police
and
protect
the
sanctity
of
life
in
all
communities
when
the
california
state
legislature
approved
it
last
month
she
said
she
was
proud
of
her
colleagues
significant
change
is
never
easy
but
those
who
voted
today
looked
to
their
conscience
and
found
the
courage
to
do
the
right
thing
for
california
weber
said
at
the
time
she
added
i
have
to
thank
the
families
who
have
lost
loved
ones
to
police
violence
they
have
been
the
energy
and
the
moral
compass
for
making
this
possible
on
monday
weber
said
the
measure
basically
changes
the
culture
of
policing
in
california
also
speaking
at
monday's
event
was
kori
mccoy
whose
younger
brother
willie
mccoy
was
killed
in
february
police
officers
had
discovered
willie
mccoy
asleep
in
his
car
in
a
taco
bell
parking
lot
in
vallejo
with
a
gun
in
his
lap
and
the
doors
locked
when
mccoy
started
to
wake
up
the
six
officers
fired
a
total
of
shots
in
seconds
killing
him
the
reality
is
officers
rarely
face
consequences
and
families
like
mine
are
left
to
wonder
who
is
policing
the
police
kori
mccoy
said
on
monday
of
the
new
use-of-force
law
mccoy
said
it
offers
a
ray
of
solace
for
my
family
and
hope
that
it
will
spare
other
families
from
bearing
this
burden
with
us
after
newsom
signed
the
bill
into
law
california
police
chiefs
association
president
ron
lawrence
issued
a
statement
saying
that
along
with
another
measure
that
deals
with
training
and
funding
the
new
legislation
will
modernize
our
state's
policies
on
the
use
of
force
implementing
the
very
best
practices
gathered
from
across
our
nation
the
law
was
approved
with
bipartisan
support
and
was
backed
by
newsom
and
leaders
in
the
legislature
along
the
way
it
was
tempered
to
allay
concerns
raised
by
police
associations
and
those
compromises
have
prompted
criticisms
that
the
legislation
doesn't
go
far
enough
in
mandating
change
the
compromises
prompted
the
black
lives
matter
movement
an
early
sponsor
of
the
bill
to
withdraw
its
support
unfortunately
in
efforts
to
get
law
enforcement
to
lift
their
opposition
the
bill
was
so
significantly
amended
that
it
is
no
longer
the
kind
of
meaningful
legislation
we
can
support
said
black
lives
matter's
melina
abdullah
a
co-founder
of
its
los
angeles
chapter
the
group
also
criticized
the
pairing
of
the
new
law
with
a
separate
bill
that
sends
more
money
to
police
budgets
that
bill
sb
calls
for
more
training
for
officers
and
more
clarity
about
the
legal
standards
for
the
use
of
force
and
its
backers
note
that
it
also
requires
police
agencies
to
adopt
policies
on
de-escalation
tactics
and
response
proportionality
in
addition
to
rules
about
nonlethal
alternatives
and
rendering
medical
aid
the
american
civil
liberties
union
which
backed
ab
said
it
is
a
common-sense
bill
modeled
after
best
practices
already
in
place
in
some
departments
and
that
we
know
work
to
reduce
police
killings
and
save
lives
