speaks

in

surf

in

iowa
last
week
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
has
been
rolling
around
iowa
in
an
rv
with
a
message
plastered
on
the
back
honk
if
you're
ready
for
big
structural
change
on
the
campaign
trail
and
in
debates
warren
talks
a
lot
about
the
need
for
big
structural
change
rather
than
incremental
adjustments
for
years
even
before
she
was
a
politician
warren
was
an
evangelist
for
one
main
cause
the
fragility
of
the
middle
class
she
first
came
into
the
political
spotlight
in
the
aftermath
of
the
great
recession
for
creating
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
under
president
barack
obama
and
as
a
law
professor
she
often
specialized
in
bankruptcy
at
a
recent
campaign
stop
in
iowa
she
candidly
told
voters
that
maybe
it
was
because
she
didn't
have
a
lot
of
money
growing
up
that
she
was
drawn
to
study
the
very
aspects
of
the
law
that
revolved
around
money
our
government
is
working
great
for
a
thinner
and
thinner
slice
at
the
top
and
working
badly
for
everyone
else
she
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
in
the
wide-ranging
interview
warren
also
spoke
about
her
ideas
for
structural
change
on
trade
and
guns
and
how
her
own
life
has
shaped
the
politics
and
plans
she
promotes
and
even
though
she's
known
as
the
candidate
who
has
a
prescription
or
plan
for
just
everything
she
also
got
personal
talking
about
her
own
faith
and
even
fashion
when
asked
how
she
would
respond
to
voters
who
question
her
judgment
on
race
given
her
now
infamous
dna
test
in
an
attempt
to
prove
native
american
ancestry
warren
punted
instead
she
outlined
her
plans
to
assist
african-american
voters
by
investing
in
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
in
a
campaign
season
dominated
president
trump's
rhetoric
on
race
warren
also
explained
why
she
has
openly
called
trump
a
white
supremacist
on
trade
and
the
criticism
that
her
trade
policy
is
more
akin
to
trump's
than
obama's
donald
trump
is
into
tariffs
because
he's
all
about
tariffs
by
tweet
he
has
no
trade
policy
he's
into
chaos
i
start
by
saying
who
are
we
going
to
have
at
the
table
to
negotiate
these
trade
deals
and
the
answer
is
we're
gonna
have
the
people
who
are
most
affected
i
want
the
unions
at
the
table
i
want
small-business
owners
at
the
table
i
want
small
farmers
the
independent
farmers
right
here
in
iowa
i
want
em
at
the
table
when
we're
hashing
out
our
trade
deals
on
referring
to
trump
as
a
white
supremacist
this
is
a
man
who
as
president
of
the
united
states
refers
to
people
in
charlottesville
who
are
white
supremacists
as
fine
people
a
man
who
says
he
doesn't
want
any
more
immigrants
coming
here
from
shithole
countries
a
man
who
describes
people
who
flee
for
their
lives
from
central
america
as
mounting
an
invasion
on
our
country
a
man
who
has
used
racist
language
and
racist
imagery
over
and
over
and
over
and
most
of
all
a
man
who
winks
and
nods
at
the
white
supremacists
and
who
in
turn
is
embraced
and
celebrated
by
the
white
supremacists
you
know
when
the
white
supremacists
call
donald
trump
one
of
their
own
i
tend
to
believe
them
on
guns
more
on
that
here
we
need
to
approach
guns
and
gun
safety
differently

warren

we
need
to
approach
guns
and
gun
safety
differently
it's
not
just
oh
here's
one
idea
let's
go
fight
about
this
one
idea
and
here
is
a
lot
of
things
that
we
have
talked
about
universal
background
checks
get
assault
weapons
off
the
streets
i'm
all
in
favor
of
those
but
we're
approaching
it
as
if
it's
one
and
done
or
three
and
done
and
then
we
can
all
go
back
to
the
old
ways
i
don't
think
that's
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
the
way
i
look
at
this
is
we
need
to
set
a
goal
i
want
to
see
us
cut
the
number
of
deaths
by
and
let
me
just
remind
you
where
we
were
back
in
when
five
people
died
for
every
million
miles
traveled
on
our
roads
we
decided
as
a
country
that
we
wanted
to
have
better
safety
for
people
who
travel
and
some
of
it
was
obvious
seat
belts
safety
glass
so
the
stuff
didn't
shatter
and
slash
people
to
death
some
of
it
hadn't
even
been
invented
like
airbags
and
automatic
braking
systems
but
we
made
that
commitment
and
we
have
cut
deaths
on
our
roads
by
i
want
to
do
the
same
thing
around
guns
on
faith
it's
just
a
part
of
who
i
am
and
has
been
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i've
taught
sunday
school
i've
occasionally
had
a
chance
to
preach
from
the
pulpit
in
some
of
the
churches
that
i've
visited
i
read
the
bible
i
think
a
lot
about
what
it
means
to
be
a
moral
person
in
america
today
i
truly
believe
that
we
are
called
on
to
see
the
value
of
every
human
being
and
not
to
sit
back
and
reflect
on
it
but
to
act
matthew
for
i
was
hungry
and
you
fed
me
i
was
thirsty
and
you
gave
me
drink
i
was
in
prison
and
you
visited
me
it's
not
just
about
having
a
good
heart
it's
about
getting
up
and
doing
what
needs
to
be
done
on
that
dna
test
and
her
judgment
on
race
like
anyone
who's
being
honest
boy
i
admit
that
i've
made
mistakes
and
i
have
regrets
and
i've
done
my
best
both
to
apologize
and
to
learn
from
them
but
most
of
all
to
be
a
good
partner
going
forward
to
think
about
it
in
as
deliberate
a
way
as
possible
what's
broken
and
what
we
can
do
to
fix
it
so
think
for
example
about
education
we
have
an
education
system
higher
ed
that
right
now
just
slams
all
of
our
kids
but
particularly
slams
african-american
kids
african-americans
are
more
likely
to
have
to
borrow
money
to
go
to
school
to
borrow
more
money
while
they're
in
school
and
to
have
a
harder
time
paying
it
when
they
get
out
on
the
other
side
and
that
means
that
much
of
what
happens
in
higher
ed
is
actually
exacerbating
the
black-white
wealth
gap
in
america
so
how
do
you
think
about
that
part
of
it
is
in
my
plan
to
put
billion
into
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
that
helps
level
the
playing
field
on
fashion
warren
has
an
iconic
look
black
top
black
pants
jewel
toned
blazer
or
cardigan
that
she
wears
nearly
everywhere
on
the
stump
at
debates
and
even
to
our
interview
it's
easy
you
know
how
long
it
takes
me
to
get
dressed
in
the
morning
four
minutes
life
has
enough
decisions
in
it
right
now
i'm
saving
my
decision
