former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
criticized
the
trump
administration's
approach
to
north
korea
during
a
speech
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
in
washington
d.c.
on
monday
it's
no
secret
that
former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
president
trump
on
a
whole
range
of
subjects
but
in
his
first
public
remarks
since
his
ouster
earlier
this
month
bolton
made
clear
just
how
deeply
disconnected
he
was
from
his
former
boss
on
how
to
handle
north
korea
in
a
speech
to
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
bolton
outlined
a
vision
for
addressing
north
korea's
nuclear
program
that
was
completely
at
odds
with
the
white
house
position
on
pyongyang
every
day
that
goes
by
makes
north
korea
a
more
dangerous
country
bolton
said
you
don't
like
their
behavior
today
what
do
you
think
it
will
be
when
they
have
nuclear
weapons
that
can
be
delivered
to
american
cities
after
exchanging
escalating
threats
with
north
korea's
leader
kim
jong
un
during
the
first
year
of
his
presidency
trump
held
a
historic
face-to-face
meeting
with
kim
last
year
in
singapore
that
summit
ended
with
a
vague
agreement
to
support
the
denuclearization
of
the
korean
peninsula
since
then
despite
two
more
in-person
meetings
between
kim
and
trump
there
hasn't
been
much
progress
toward
actually
dismantling
north
korea's
nuclear
program
or
even
agreeing
what
that
might
entail
while
not
calling
out
trump
directly
bolton
said
the
focus
on
holding
summits
with
kim
is
misplaced
he
said
the
u.s.
needs
to
be
more
concerned
about
ending
the
nuclear
threat
posed
by
north
korea
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
dprk
has
not
made
a
strategic
decision
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
bolton
declared
at
the
start
of
his
remarks
in
fact
i
think
the
contrary
is
true
i
think
the
strategic
decision
that
kim
jong
un
is
operating
through
is
he
will
do
whatever
he
can
to
keep
a
deliverable
nuclear
weapons
capability
bolton
is
known
for
his
hawkish
views
and
almost
always
seemed
an
odd
fit
for
the
trump
administration
since
trump
campaigned
on
getting
the
u.s.
out
of
long-lasting
wars
abroad
bolton's
policy
disagreements
seemed
to
lessen
his
role
in
the
administration
even
before
he
was
pushed
out
bolton
was
conspicuously
absent
during
trump's
last
meeting
with
kim
in
the
dmz
trump
has
argued
that
his
interactions
with
kim
have
helped
to
prevent
a
devastating
war
he
repeatedly
praises
kim
saying
they
have
a
great
relationship
and
that
he
is
optimistic
about
a
deal
between
the
u.s.
and
north
korea
trump
has
also
downplayed
north
korea's
recent
short-range-missile
launches
during
his
remarks
bolton
urged
the
u.s.
government
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
pushing
for
regime
change
in
north
korea
a
position
the
white
house
has
publicly
rejected
he
also
said
the
u.s.
should
consider
working
with
china
toward
the
reunification
of
the
korean
peninsula
with
a
freely
elected
government
but
ultimately
bolton
said
if
these
other
options
fail
the
u.s.
will
have
no
choice
but
to
go
another
route
if
you
believe
that
it
is
unacceptable
for
north
korea
to
have
nuclear
weapons
at
some
point
military
force
has
to
be
an
option
bolton
said
bolton's
positions
have
also
not
endeared
him
to
the
north
korean
government
which
repeatedly
insulted
him
during
his
time
at
the
trump
white
house
i'm
also
sure
that
the
leadership
of
north
korea
is
delighted
that
i'm
here
today
in
a
private
capacity
bolton
quipped
