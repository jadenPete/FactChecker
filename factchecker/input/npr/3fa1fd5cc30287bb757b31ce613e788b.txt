top
rebels
from
the
revolutionary

announced
a
new
stage
of
fighting
despite
a
peace
accord
that
the
leftist
guerrilla
group
signed
with
the
national
government
almost
three
years
ago

more
than
armed
fighters
stood
in
green
fatigues
and
in

of
a
sign
that
read
as
long
as
there
is
a
will
to
fight
there
will
be
hope
for
victory
a
guerrilla
leader
involved
in
the
peace
negotiations
accused
the
government
of
betraying
key
components
of
the
deal
the
state
has
not
fulfilled
its
most
important
obligation
which
is
to
guarantee
the
life
of
its
citizens
and
especially
avoid
assassinations
for
political
reasons

under

treaty
thousands
of
marxist-
and
leninist-inspired
guerrillas
gave
up
their
arms

for
the
colombian
government's
commitment
to
protecting
them
and
building
infrastructure
in
poor
isolated
communities
in
the
countryside
in
may
marin
said
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
farc
fighters
to
surrender
their
weapons
without
first
getting
guarantees

process
responding
to
the
video
on
thursday
duque
said
colombia
was
not
facing
the
birth

threats

narcoterrorists
sheltered
and
supported

and

a
golden
opportunity
