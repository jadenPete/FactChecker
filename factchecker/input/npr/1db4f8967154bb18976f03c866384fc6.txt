whistleblowers
have
been

in
government
institutions
since
the
late
s
but
it
has
always
been
risky
washington
has
been
brought
to
the
brink
of
impeaching
the
president
based
on
a
complaint
from
an
anonymous
whistleblower
whistleblowing
dates
back
to
the
nation's
earliest
days
and
since
then
it
has
been
a
risky
and
controversial
exercise
americans
passed
the
world's
first
whistleblower
protection
law
in
says
allison
stanger
author
of
whistleblowers
honesty
in
america
from
washington
to
trump
so
we're
a
leader
in
this
realm
and
whistleblowing
is
really
in
our
dna
so
that's
why
this
particular
moment
is
so
interesting
stanger
a
professor
at
middlebury
college
says
the
first
whistleblowers
reported
on
the
actions
of
one
esek
hopkins
in
the
late
s
he
was
the
first
commodore
of
the
u.s.
navy
and
they
blew
the
whistle
on
him
ostensibly
for
torturing
british
prisoners
of
war
stanger
says
he
was
removed
from
his
post
he
tried
to
retaliate
against
the
whistleblowers
who
were
thrown
in
jail
and
then
congress
intervened
whistleblowers
have
been
reporting
wrongdoing
in
government
institutions
ever
since
but
it
has
always
been
a
risk
says
attorney
david
colapinto
whistleblowing
is
a
career-limiting
phenomenon
in
the
federal
workforce
he
says
that's
why
a
lot
of
people
don't
do
it
colapinto
a
founder
of
the
national
whistleblower
center
says
the
whistleblower
protection
enhancement
act
allows
workers
to
report
wrongdoing
they
see
in
their
agencies
directly
to
members
of
congress
but
there
are
different
rules
for
people
who
work
in
national
security
if
you
work
in
the
intelligence
community
you
must
bring
your
concern
to
the
inspector
general
before
you
can
go
to
congress
he
says
whereas
an
employee
at
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
for
example
can
go
right
to
their
member
of
congress
or
the
committee
that
has
jurisdiction
over
housing
and
report
their
concerns
those
are
two
major
differences
as
we're
seeing
play
out
colapinto
says
the
whistleblower
who
reportedly
became
concerned
about
conversations
president
trump
had
with
the
president
of
ukraine
went
through
proper
channels
and
reported
his
or
her
concerns
to
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
says
colapinto
the
ig
deemed
it
an
urgent
concern
and
reported
it
to
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
who
is
under
law
supposed
to
submit
it
to
congress
however
he
has
so
far
refused
and
that's
where
things
broke
down
kel
mcclanahan
executive
director
of
national
security
counselors
says
the
director
of
national
intelligence
has
no
authority
to
insert
himself
into
the
middle
of
the
process
he
is
basically
sending
a
message
to
all
whistleblowers
that
the
path
that
you
fought
so
hard
to
get
is
still
not
going
to
work
mcclanahan
says
and
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
that
sends
a
very
dangerous
message
mcclanahan
says
because
basically
in
this
world
you
either
protect
all
whistleblowers
or
you
protect
none
president
trump
has
attacked
the
whistleblower
who
reportedly
complained
about
him
as
in
trump's
words
a
partisan
person
who
carried
out
a
political
hack
job
but
mcclanahan
says
the
whistleblower
statute
specifically
leaves
out
political
disagreement
from
its
definition
of
urgent
concern
what's
more
the
consequences
for
whistleblowers
can
be
severe
members
of
the
intelligence
community
are
constantly
told
not
to
go
outside
the
family
mcclanahan
says
they're
told
that
they
can
be
prosecuted
they're
told
that
they
can
have
their
clearances
removed
and
that
means
they
won't
be
able
to
get
another
federal
job
in
national
security
but
for
whistleblowers
who
believe
they're
protecting
something
bigger
it
might
be
worth
the
risk
they
would
do
it
only
if
they
thought
there
was
a
higher
issue
at
stake
stanger
says
in
this
case
i
think
that's
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
our
democracy
