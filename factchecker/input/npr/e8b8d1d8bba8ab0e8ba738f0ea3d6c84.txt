updated
at
p
m
et
a
european
doctor
who
prescribes
abortion
pills
to
american
women
over
the
internet
is
suing
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
an
effort
to
continue
providing
the
medications
to
patients
in
the
united
states
the
lawsuit
being
filed
monday
in
federal
court
in
idaho
names
several
federal
officials
including
u.s.
health
and
human
services
secretary
alex
azar
in
the
lawsuit
dr
rebecca
gomperts
says
she
believes
federal
officials
have
seized
between
three
and
doses
of
abortion
drugs
she
has
prescribed
through
her
organization
aid
access
since
march
it
also
says
gomperts
believes
the
government
has
blocked
aid
access
from
receiving
payments
from
some
patients
gomperts
attorney
richard
hearn
said
the
goal
of
the
lawsuit
is
to
force
the
fda
to
stop
those
actions
and
to
prevent
gomperts
or
her
patients
from
being
prosecuted
under
federal
law
hearn
argues
that
for
many
women
who
live
long
distances
from
the
nearest
clinic
abortion
pills
ordered
online
are
the
only
practical
way
to
exercise
their
legal
right
to
an
abortion
some
women
in
the
united
states
can
exercise
that
right
just
by
going
down
the
street
if
those
women
happen
to
live
in
new
york
or
san
francisco
or
other
major
metropolitan
areas
on
either
one
of
the
coasts
hearn
said
in
an
interview
with
npr
but
women
in
idaho
and
other
rural
states
especially
conservative
states
cannot
exercise
that
right
a
handful
of
states
have
only
one
clinic
that
provides
abortions
forcing
patients
to
drive
hundreds
of
miles
to
obtain
one
under
the
trump
administration
organizations
that
provide
or
refer
patients
for
abortions
face
new
restrictions
on
how
they
can
obtain
funding
to
provide
other
kinds
of
reproductive
health
care
which
could
push
some
providers
to
stop
offering
the
procedure
and
many
states
are
attempting
to
restrict
the
procedure
in
state
law
or
by
imposing
heavy
regulations
on
clinics
since
march
the
lawsuit
says
women
from
all
states
in
the
u.s.
have
contacted
aid
access
gomperts
who
divides
her
time
between
austria
and
the
netherlands
prescribed
the
medication
to
more
than
u.s.
patients
seeking
to
end
first-trimester
pregnancies
during
that
time
according
to
the
lawsuit
the
drugs
mifepristone
and
misoprostol
are
both
approved
by
the
fda
to
induce
abortion
under
a
doctor's
direction
the
world
health
organization
recommends
a
protocol
that
involves
taking
the
two
drugs
in
tandem
mifepristone
is
especially
heavily
regulated
in
the
u.s.
and
cannot
be
obtained
at
a
commercial
pharmacy
making
it
difficult
for
many
women
to
obtain
it
gomperts
uses
telemedicine
to
consult
with
patients
online
writes
a
prescription
and
provides
instructions
on
how
to
request
the
medication
from
an
exporter
in
india
hearn
said
the
pills
are
then
shipped
to
patients
homes
in
march
the
fda
issued
a
warning
letter
accusing
aid
access
of
violating
federal
law
by
misbranding
and
facilitating
the
improper
distribution
of
the
drugs
the
letter
said
that
the
sale
of
misbranded
and
unapproved
new
drugs
poses
an
inherent
risk
to
consumers
who
purchase
those
products
the
agency
ordered
aid
access
to
stop
distributing
the
medications
in
the
united
states
or
face
repercussions
including
the
seizure
of
the
drugs
without
notice
gomperts
stopped
prescribing
the
medications
to
u.s.
patients
for
about
two
months
from
roughly
mid-march
to
mid-may
before
resuming
according
to
her
attorney
the
fda
is
a
huge
institution
it's
very
powerful
and
it's
a
form
of
intimidation
that
is
quite
severe
gomperts
said
in
an
interview
with
npr
i
would
say
a
form
of
bullying
and
so
i
think
it's
very
important
to
stand
up
against
it
gomperts
said
she
charges
the
equivalent
of
about
for
patients
in
the
united
states
which
covers
the
consultation
prescription
and
medication
she
said
patients
who
cannot
afford
that
amount
are
asked
to
pay
what
they
can
hearn
said
gomperts
has
heard
from
women
who
say
they've
been
contacted
by
federal
officials
and
apparently
had
medications
seized
a
couple
have
gotten
letters
one
has
gotten
visited
and
those
pills
were
not
delivered
and
we
have
tracking
information
hearn
said
the
real
fear
about
seizing
medicines
is
not
the
loss
of
the
medicine
but
it's
prosecution
of
the
woman
in
the
united
states
either
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government
for
ordering
the
pills
hearn
points
to
a
separate
federal
indictment
earlier
this
year
which
accused
a
new
york
woman
ursula
wing
of
illegally
importing
and
distributing
abortion
drugs
if
convicted
the
lawsuit
says
wing
could
face
several
years
of
prison
time
federal
fines
or
both
fda
officials
declined
to
comment
on
the
pending
litigation
or
any
potential
or
pending
regulatory
actions
against
gomperts
and
aid
access
asked
if
patients
who
purchase
abortion
pills
could
be
prosecuted
officials
said
in
a
statement
emailed
to
npr
that
it
is
usually
illegal
to
import
drugs
for
personal
use
but
that
the
fda
generally
does
not
take
enforcement
action
against
individuals
who
do
so
the
statement
added
fda
remains
very
concerned
about
the
sale
of
unapproved
mifepristone
for
medical
termination
of
early
pregnancy
on
the
internet
or
via
other
channels
for
illegal
importation
because
this
bypasses
important
safeguards
designed
to
protect
women's
health
gomperts
said
she
believes
patients
can
safely
self-induce
what
is
essentially
an
early
miscarriage
provided
they
have
proper
information
and
support
what
i
think
is
very
important
is
to
really
understand
that
women
have
been
dealing
with
miscarriages
forever
gomperts
said
and
a
medical
abortion
abortion
with
pills
is
very
similar
abigail
aiken
a
public
affairs
professor
at
the
university
of
texas
austin
has
been
studying
aid
access
and
its
patients
in
a
recent
study
published
in
the
journal
bmj
aiken
examines
some
of
the
reasons
women
seek
abortion
drugs
online
including
increased
restrictions
on
the
procedure
in
many
states
there
is
certainly
interest
and
it
appears
to
be
becoming
more
intense
aiken
said
in
an
interview
with
npr
aiken
said
some
patients
also
prefer
to
take
pills
privately
at
home
rather
than
going
to
a
clinic
others
face
obstacles
such
as
ultrasound
requirements
long
waiting
periods
and
cost
she
said
there
are
some
folks
who
would
like
to
get
to
an
abortion
clinic
but
they're
not
able
to
aiken
said
and
this
is
especially
pronounced
in
states
that
have
restrictive
abortion
policies
