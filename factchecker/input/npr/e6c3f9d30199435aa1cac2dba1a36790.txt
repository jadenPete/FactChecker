joe
walsh
a
conservative
talk-radio
host
and
former
tea
party
congressman
is
launching
a
long-shot
primary
challenge
to
president
trump
he's
the
second
republican
to
officially
announce
a
run
against
trump
who
has
a
strong
approval
rating
among
his
party's
base
walsh
supported
trump
during
his
campaign
but
in
recent
months
has
been
offering
a
bitter
critique
of
the
president
calling
trump
a
liar
and
bully
who
is
unfit
for
office
walsh
has
also
attacked
trump
from
the
right
mr
trump
isn't
a
conservative
he's
reckless
on
fiscal
issues
he's
incompetent
on
the
border
he's
clueless
on
trade
he
misunderstands
executive
power
and
he
subverts
the
rule
of
law
it's
his
poor
record
that
makes
him
most
worthy
of
a
primary
challenge

on
the

side
meanwhile
candidates
are
vying
for

far
fewer

are
attempting

a

former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
is
the
only
other
person
so
far
to
announce
he'll
try
to
unseat
trump
whose
support
among
republicans
usually
polls
in
the
s
making
him
a
formidable
party
incumbent
we
can't
take
four
more
years
of
donald
trump
and
that's
why
i'm
running
for
president
walsh
tweeted
on
sunday
it
won't
be
easy
but
bravery
is
never
easy
when
asked
by
politico
if
he
could
raise
enough
money
to
pose
a
legitimate
challenge
to
trump
walsh
responded
abso-freaking-lutely
there's
a
drumbeat
from
a
lot
of
people
out
there
for
somebody
who
wants
to
take
this
on
walsh
has
a
history
of
controversial
incendiary
and
offensive
comments
in
october
walsh
said
on
twitter
that
he
was
backing
trump
for
president
saying
on
november
th
if
trump
loses
i'm
grabbing
my
musket
you
in
walsh
was
pulled
off
the
air
from
his
radio
show
in
following
his
use
of
racial
slurs
in
a
discussion
over
the
controversy
around
the
washington
redskins
name
he
later
tweeted
i'm
trying
to
have
an
honest
adult
conversations
about
words
without
resorting
to
alphabet
soup
phrases
c-word
n-word
etc
walsh
who
has
called
president
barack
obama
a
muslim
and
a
traitor
told
george
stephanopoulos
on
abc
news's
this
week
on
sunday
that
he
has
apologized
for
those
comments
saying
he
feels
responsible
for
some
of
trump's
incendiary
rhetoric
i
helped
create
trump
there's
no
doubt
about
that
the
personal
ugly
politics
i
regret
that
walsh
said
now
we
have
a
guy
in
the
white
house
that's
all
he
does
in
a
video
posted
to
his
website
the
former
one-term
illinois
congressman
says
these
are
not
conventional
times
these
are
urgent
times
let's
be
real
these
are
scary
times
he
goes
on
we're
tired
of
a
president
waking
up
every
morning
and
tweeting
ugly
insults
at
ordinary
americans
we're
tired
of
a
president
who
sides
with
putin
against
our
own
intelligence
community
we're
tired
of
a
president
who
thinks
he's
above
the
law
we're
tired
of
a
president
who's
tweeting
this
country
into
a
recession
