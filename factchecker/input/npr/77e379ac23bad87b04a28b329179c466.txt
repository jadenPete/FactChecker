center
marches
with
other
young
climate
activists
last
week
outside
the
white
house
in
washington
d.c.
spurred
by
what
they
see
as
a
sluggish
ineffectual
response
to
the
existential
threat
of
global
warming
student
activists
from
around
the
world
are
skipping
school
friday
for
what
organizers
call
a
global
climate
strike
the
young
activists
are
protesting
as
the
u.n.
prepares
to
hold
its
climate
action
summit
on
monday
in
new
york
city
the
strike's
figurehead
is
year-old
swedish
activist
greta
thunberg
who
traveled
from
sweden
to
new
york
on
an
emissions-free
sailboat
a
little
over
a
year
ago
thunberg
began
her
school
strike
for
the
climate
by
herself
outside
the
swedish
parliament
support
for
a
school
climate
strike
has
since
spread
across
the
globe
in
the
past
year
thunberg
has
been
nominated
for
the
nobel
peace
prize
by
norwegian
lawmakers
she's
also
met
with
pope
francis
and
lawmakers
in
several
countries
we
are
currently
on
track
for
a
world
that
could
displace
billions
of
people
from
their
homes
thunberg
warned
this
week
as
she
accepted
amnesty
international's
ambassador
of
conscience
award
she
ended
her
acceptance
speech
with
a
call
to
action
see
you
on
the
streets
in
new
york
city
thousands
of
students
are
expected
to
fill
the
streets
alongside
thunberg
because
as
the
city's
school
district
announced
on
twitter
it
is
giving
strikers
excused
absences
in
oregon
portland
public
schools
is
doing
the
same
strikes
also
are
planned
in
rural
areas
where
just
a
few
dozen
protesters
are
expected
nicholas
duvernay
organized
a
protest
in
his
politically
conservative
small
town
of
la
grande
ore
since
probably
the
beginning
of
my
junior
year
in
high
school
i've
been
interested
in
climate
science
and
pretty
passionate
about
environmental
topics
says
duvernay
who
plans
to
study
climate
science
when
he
attends
college
next
year
a
washington
post-kaiser
family
foundation
poll
this
week
shows
a
majority
of
teenagers
believe
human-caused
climate
change
will
cause
harm
to
them
and
a
quarter
of
the
poll
respondents
said
they
have
participated
in
a
school
walk-out
a
rally
or
contacted
a
government
official
on
the
issue
there
have
been
similar
student
events
in
the
past
year
but
this
time
students
are
asking
adults
to
join
them
at
the
university
of
nevada
reno
stallar
lufrano-jardine
is
setting
up
an
event
on
the
campus
where
she's
an
employee
and
student
i'm
bothered
by
the
lack
of
movement
to
make
meaningful
advances
to
solve
the
climate
crisis
says
lufrano-jardine
but
it's
clear
younger
people
are
leading
this
movement
and
they
say
most
adults
especially
policy-makers
are
moving
far
too
slowly
strike
organizers
have
a
list
of
demands
that
includes
respect
of
indigenous
land
sustainable
agriculture
protecting
biodiversity
environmental
justice
and
a
just
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
and
towards
renewable
energy
said
year-old
baltimore
resident
and
organizer
nadia
nazar
many
of
those
demands
are
part
of
the
green
new
deal
which
was
crafted
by
progressive
democratic
lawmakers
but
so
far
hasn't
gone
anywhere
in
congress
at
a
capitol
hill
press
event
this
week
nazar
said
she
hopes
the
proposal
defines
her
generation
i
am
not
a
part
of
generation
z.
i
am
a
part
of
gen
gnd
the
generation
of
the
green
new
deal
she
said
as
supporters
cheered
also
on
capitol
hill
this
week
thunberg
and
other
activists
testified
before
lawmakers
louisiana
republican
rep
garret
graves
told
them
that
climate
change
has
exacerbated
the
loss
of
his
state's
coastline
i
agree
that
we
need
to
take
aggressive
action
i
agree
that
we
need
to
ensure
that
we
move
forward
in
a
sustainable
rational
manner
graves
said
but
his
idea
of
what
that
means
is
very
different
than
the
activists
vision
for
instance
graves
agrees
with
president
trump
on
the
need
to
withdraw
the
u.s.
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
graves
told
the
student
organizers
the
pact
allows
china
to
continue
emitting
more
carbon
dioxide
while
the
u.s.
cuts
emissions
paris
and
its
related
pledges
would
undermine
u.s.
competitiveness
his
spokesman
said
graves
got
immediate
pushback
from
the
young
activists
including
year-old
jamie
margolin
from
seattle
who
asked
how
graves
will
respond
to
questions
from
his
children
and
grandchildren
about
whether
he
did
enough
to
address
climate
change
can
you
really
look
them
in
the
eye
and
say
no
sorry
i
couldn't
do
anything
because
that
country
over
there
didn't
do
anything
so
if
they're
not
going
to
do
it
then
i'm
not
that
is
shameful
and
that
is
cowardly
margolin
said
organizers
are
saying
this
climate
strike
will
be
the
largest
yet
more
than
scientists
around
the
world
have
pledged
to
join
some
companies
also
have
signed
on
including
patagonia
and
seventh
generation
