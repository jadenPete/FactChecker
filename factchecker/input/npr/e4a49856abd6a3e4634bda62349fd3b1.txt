rep

speaks
during
a
news
conference
in
may
as
activists
urge
congress
to
begin
impeachment
proceedings
against
president
trump
with
a
majority
of
house
democratic
lawmakers
now
behind
him
rep
al
green
says
he'll
try
for
a
fourth
time
to
impeach
president
trump
after
congress
returns
next
month
green
first
called
for
impeachment
four
months
into
trump's
presidency
in
may
now
more
than
house
democrats
have
publicly
said
they
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
according
to
npr's
tracker
things
start
with
a
spark
and
sometimes
the
spark
is
ignored
green
said
following
a
houston
forum
with
his
constituents
earlier
this
month
other
times
the
spark
can
cause
others
to
become
consumed
with
the
righteousness
of
a
cause
and
participate
in
the
cause
itself
the
eight-term
congressman
has
remained
the
lone
lawmaker
calling
for
trump's
impeachment
from
the
house
floor
for
more
than
two
years
but
during
that
time
he
has
been
joined
by
a
steady
stream
of
democrats
as
they
took
control
of
the
chamber
this
year
however
democratic
leadership
including
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
is
urging
patience
and
remains
resistant
to
green's
plan
new
mexico
rep
ben
ray
lujan
is
the
lone
leadership
member
behind
an
impeachment
inquiry
this
is
not
a
position
i've
reached
lightly
lujan
said
in
a
statement
monday
try
try
again
green
first
made
his
impeachment
call
from
a
republican-controlled
chamber
days
after
trump
fired
his
then-fbi
director
james
comey
in
may
the
move
came
on
the
heels
of
concerns
that
trump
had
obstructed
a
department
of
justice
investigation
into
russian
ties
to
his
presidential
campaign
at
the
time
only
a
handful
of
lawmakers
were
publicly
supportive
of
impeachment
including
california
democratic
reps
brad
sherman
and
maxine
waters
green
who
is
african
american
said
he
received
several
racist
and
threatening
messages
in
response
he
said
he
has
upped
his
security
since
those
messages
there's
always
a
canary
in
the
coal
mine
green
said
it
has
been
my
misfortune
to
be
the
canary
in
the
coal
mine
since
that
first
call
green
has
called
for
impeachment
on
the
house
floor
two
more
times
in
the
most
recent
attempt
on
july
the
house
voted
to
to
stop
the
discussion
green
says
his
impeachment
case
against
trump
began
in
a
law
school
class
he
attended
at
texas
southern
university
in
the
early
s
and
my
guess
is
if
i
hadn't
gone
to
law
school
i
wouldn't
have
had
that
sense
of
how
to
remove
a
president
from
office
said
green
he
has
made
it
a
central
talking
point
talking
to
voters
from
michigan
to
mississippi
during
a
bit
of
an
impeachment
tour
this
summer
although
green
a
former
judge
and
head
of
the
houston
naacp
is
quick
to
say
he
also
discusses
kitchen
table
issues
such
as
social
security
health
care
and
voting
rights
but
part
of
the
kitchen
table
issues
now
is
that
of
impeachment
green
said
wherever
i
go
i
usually
bring
it
up
it's
just
rather
unusual
for
me
not
to
bring
it
up
because
we
truly
want
to
deal
with
the
issues
that
are
impacting
all
of
us
this
has
to
be
one
of
them
it's
not
the
best
thing
politically
but
not
everyone
agrees
that
impeachment
is
the
answer
at
a
local
forum
for
green's
th
congressional
district
longtime
acquaintance
riyad
abu-taha
says
beating
trump
in
the
presidential
elections
may
be
more
beneficial
green
had
ended
the
meeting
on
his
case
for
impeachment
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
really
to
find
a
good
good
candidate
from
the
democratic
party
where
you
know
they
can
beat
trump
in
and
then
you
know
then
he
can
be
tried
for
criminal
acts
said
abu-taha
who
runs
a
houston
area
media
group
green
has
also
faced
off
against
pelosi
and
other
house
democratic
leaders
who
want
to
take
a
more
conservative
approach
recently
rep
jerry
nadler
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
said
an
impeachment
inquiry
was
already
underway
however
nadler
has
yet
to
issue
a
direct
statement
saying
he
is
publicly
in
support
in
line
with
pelosi's
directives
to
her
party
to
be
patient
that
has
irritated
green
who
says
lawmakers
need
to
be
clear
about
their
positions
on
impeachment
and
face
the
consequences
either
way
in
the
end
green
knows
he
is
taking
significant
political
risks
i
don't
know
how
people
will
ultimately
see
this
when
they
go
to
the
polls
to
vote
taking
this
position
is
no
assurance
that
i'm
going
to
get
reelected
green
said
so
i'm
just
convinced
that
it's
not
the
best
thing
to
do
politically
for
me
but
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
and
when
you
do
the
right
thing
in
my
opinion
the
other
things
will
take
care
of
themselves
