strong
majorities
of
americans
from
across
the
political
spectrum
support
laws
that
allow
family
members
or
law
enforcement
to
petition
a
judge
to
temporarily
remove
guns
from
a
person
who
is
seen
to
be
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
according
to
a
new
apm
research
lab
guns
america
call
to
mind
survey
these
laws
often
called
extreme
risk
protection
order
laws
or
red
flag
laws
have
received
renewed
attention
after
people
were
killed
during
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
variations
of
these
red
flag
laws
are
in
place
in
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
since
the
mass
shootings
president
trump
and
some
congressional
republicans
have
signaled
support
for
federal
red
flag
legislation
though
next
steps
in
congress
are
unclear
at
this
point
overall
of
americans
surveyed
support
family-initiated
erpos
and
support
them
when
initiated
by
law
enforcement
according
to
the
survey
which
was
conducted
before
the
recent
texas
and
ohio
shootings
there
is
broad
support
among
republicans
and
gun
owners
for
these
types
of
laws
the
poll
found
two-thirds
of
republicans
and
of
gun
owners
support
allowing
police
to
seek
the
court
orders
higher
percentages
of
republicans
and
of
gun
owners
support
allowing
family
members
to
seek
them
there
is
broad
support
among
men
and
women
but
there
is
a
gender
gap
with
more
women
in
favor
of
red
flag
laws
than
men
there
are
also
regional
differences
with
a
smaller
percentage
in
the
west
though
still
a
majority
supportive
of
these
laws
support
for
the
laws
also
increases
the
higher
the
level
of
educational
attainment
a
topic
of
compromise
experts
describe
a
few
reasons
that
a
variety
of
people
would
support
erpo
laws
even
some
who
might
generally
be
against
gun
control
cassandra
crifasi
deputy
director
of
the
johns
hopkins
center
for
gun
policy
and
research
points
to
the
temporary
component
this
means
that
once
the
temporary
order
expires
the
person
is
then
able
to
ask
the
judge
to
return
his
or
her
weapons
i
think
the
other
piece
is
that
it's
not
focused
on
all
gun
owners
it's
focused
on
gun
owners
who
are
exhibiting
risky
behaviors
crifasi
said
i
think
we
can
reasonably
agree
that
someone
who
is
posting
online
about
committing
a
mass
shooting
or
someone
who
is
sharing
with
a
family
member
or
a
friend
that
they're
thinking
about
harming
themselves
that's
someone
that
we
would
want
to
separate
from
firearms
amy
swearer
a
senior
legal
policy
analyst
at
the
conservative-leaning
heritage
foundation
describes
erpo
laws
as
a
type
of
intermediate
measure
data
from
connecticut
a
state
that
has
had
one
of
these
laws
since
show
that
it
has
been
used
to
remove
firearms
in
all
kinds
of
situations
violent
threats
against
school
officials
co-workers
wives
girlfriends
and
children
and
especially
cases
of
possible
suicide
these
individuals
whether
they
haven't
committed
a
crime
yet
or
they
haven't
quite
gotten
within
the
radar
of
the
mental
health
system
they're
still
able
to
legally
purchase
and
possess
firearms
swearer
explained
so
these
laws
give
another
avenue
of
intervening
in
those
instances
before
these
people
act
on
those
signs
of
dangerousness
despite
support
opposition
remains
roughly
in
respondents
strongly
oppose
red
flag
laws
according
to
the
survey
results
that's
higher
among
gun
owners
percent
of
gun
owners
strongly
oppose
police-initiated
erpos
and
strongly
oppose
family-initiated
erpos
broadened
to
include
respondents
who
somewhat
oppose
red
flag
laws
of
respondents
overall
oppose
police-initiated
erpos
while
oppose
family-initiated
ones
respondents
living
in
southern
and
western
states
reported
the
highest
levels
of
opposition
to
erpo
laws
some
opposition
is
likely
born
out
of
the
general
rhetoric
around
the
gun
debate
related
to
serious
distrust
and
seizing
guns
swearer
explained
one
colorado-based
gun
rights
group
for
instance
refers
to
the
state's
recently
passed
red
flag
law
as
a
gun
confiscation
scheme
local
sheriffs
have
indicated
they'll
refuse
to
enforce
it
once
it
goes
into
effect
in
saying
the
law
violates
the
second
amendment
and
due
process
and
doesn't
have
a
mental
health
care
component
in
a
february
facebook
post
when
the
bill
that
led
to
the
law
was
being
considered
colorado-based
rocky
mountain
gun
owners
urged
its
supporters
to
attend
a
colorado
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
on
the
state's
bill
now
there
are
legitimate
underlying
fears
swearer
said
in
the
sense
that
if
these
laws
are
not
properly
narrowed
that
if
they're
not
using
specific-enough
language
that
if
they're
not
being
couched
in
appropriate
measures
of
due
process
that
it
can
open
the
door
for
a
lot
of
abuse
support
may
not
translate
into
legislative
action
momentum
for
federal
red
flag
legislation
is
building
in
washington
d.c.
the
democratic-controlled
house
judiciary
committee
announced
that
in
september
it
will
take
up
h.r.
the
extreme
risk
protection
order
act
of
trump
has
reportedly
been
in
talks
with
senators
about
potential
gun
control
legislation
and
assisting
states
with
implementing
their
own
erpo
laws
gun
violence
prevention
activists
in
partnership
with
powerful
groups
like
everytown
for
gun
safety
recently
protested
in
cities
across
the
u.s.
to
pressure
senators
to
pass
legislation
for
measures
such
as
universal
background
checks
and
extreme
risk
protection
orders
for
a
very
long
time
many
elected
officials
have
been
responsive
to
single-issue
voters
on
guns
and
those
single-issue
voters
have
been
people
on
the
side
of
expanding
gun
rights
or
protecting
perceived
protection
of
gun
rights
johns
hopkins
crifasi
said
there
has
not
been
the
same
push
of
single-issue
voters
on
the
side
of
gun
safety
i
think
that's
starting
to
change
republican
sens
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
and
marco
rubio
of
florida
have
pushed
for
a
federal
red
flag
law
but
democrats
also
want
universal
background
check
legislation
to
pass
along
with
it
chuck
schumer
the
democratic
senate
minority
leader
said
he
wants
the
two
paired
and
will
not
support
a
stand-alone
bill
for
just
red
flag
legislation
he
said
in
a
statement
this
month
that
passing
a
tepid
version
of
a
red
flag
bill
would
be
an
ineffective
cop-out
he
noted
we
democrats
are
not
going
to
settle
for
half-measures
so
republicans
can
feel
better
and
try
to
push
the
issue
of
gun
violence
off
to
the
side
democrats
in
the
senate
will
seek
to
require
that
any
erpo
bill
that
comes
to
the
floor
is
accompanied
by
a
vote
on
the
house-passed
universal
background
checks
legislation
it
has
been
proved
before
that
public
support
does
not
always
translate
into
legislative
action
in
the
aftermath
of
the
parkland
fla
school
shooting
in
for
example
trump
encouraged
states
to
pass
their
own
erpo
laws
as
part
of
a
school
safety
plan
but
there
was
no
federal
legislative
push
from
the
white
house
we
do
not
live
in
a
direct
democracy
said
harry
wilson
director
of
the
institute
for
policy
and
opinion
research
at
roanoke
college
we
don't
live
in
a
nation
where
issues
are
simply
put
to
a
vote
and
the
majority
rules
once
people
and
lawmakers
have
an
actual
piece
of
legislation
in
front
of
them
support
can
weaken
wilson
noted
citing
the
pushback
around
the
details
of
the
colorado
law
as
an
example
district
attorney
george
brauchler
a
republican
who
supported
the
version
of
the
bill
withdrew
his
support
in
over
what
he
described
as
extreme
provisions
when
people
start
seeing
the
details
of
exactly
how
you're
going
to
accomplish
that
goal
then
support
begins
to
fall
off
wilson
said
that's
true
certainly
of
gun
control
laws
but
it's
true
in
a
