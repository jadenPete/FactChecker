updated

et
the
recent
stream
of
republicans
announcing
plans
to
retire
in
means
lawmakers
may
be
losing
hope
that
there
is
a
path
to
retaking
the
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
next
november
so
far
house
gop
lawmakers
have
announced
they
will
not
run
for
re-election
two
of
those
are
running
for
higher
office
alabama
rep
bradley
byrne
for
senate
and
montana
rep
greg
gianforte
for
governor
in
their
respective
states
on
the
democratic
side
three
members
have
said
they
will
not
run
and
assistant
speaker
ben
ray
luj
n
has
decided
to
run
for
senate
in
new
mexico
instead
of
for
his
house
seat
when
control
flips
in
the
house
life
in
the
minority
party
is
often
an
adjustment
most
republicans
serving
now
are
just
learning
what
it's
like
when
their
party
isn't
in
charge
of
the
chamber
they
have
little
ability
to
steer
the
legislative
agenda
and
opportunities
for
bipartisan
cooperation
are
scarce
in
an
increasingly
polarized
house
heading
into
a
presidential
election
year
republican
conference
rules
imposing
term
limits
for
committee
chair
posts
also
mean
senior
members
have
fewer
leadership
opportunities
gop
retirements
in
a
significant
number
of
competitive
mainly
suburban
districts
gave
democrats
a
major
boost
in
but
the
bulk
of
those
calling
it
quits
this
cycle
are
in
safe
red
seats
in
rural
and
exurban
communities
republicans
will
have
plenty
of
opportunities
to
play
offense
house
democrats
represent
districts
that
president
trump
carried
in
just
three
republicans
hold
districts
that
hillary
clinton
carried
in
democrats
have
focused
their
attention
on
texas
the
state
with
the
most
republican
retirements
five
members
are
departing
after
this
term
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
dubbed
this
dynamic
a
texodus
they
have
set
up
a
satellite
operation
in
the
state
to
make
a
more
aggressive
push
to
register
new
voters
and
pump
up
turnout
among
latino
voters
a
key
bloc
that
helped
democrats
win
two
house
contests
in
the
state
in
gop
political
strategists
admit
that
changing
demographics
in
some
suburban
areas
like
the
one
outside
houston
are
making
some
formerly
reliable
red
seats
more
competitive
but
they
also
emphasize
that
democrats
will
still
have
to
spend
resources
defending
freshmen
lawmakers
who
won
narrowly
in
but
will
face
a
tougher
political
environment
with
trump
on
the
ballot
