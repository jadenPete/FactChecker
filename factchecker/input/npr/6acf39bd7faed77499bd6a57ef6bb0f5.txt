president
trump
has
tweeted
what
experts
say
is
almost
certainly
an
image
from
a
classified
satellite
or
drone
showing
the
aftermath
of
an
accident
at
an
iranian
space
facility
the
united
states
of
america
was
not
involved
in
the
catastrophic
accident
during
final
launch
preparations
for
the
safir
space
launch
vehicle
launch
at
semnan
launch
site
one
in
iran
the
president
said
in
a
tweet
that
accompanied
the
image
on
friday
i
wish
iran
best
wishes
and
good
luck
in
determining
what
happened
at
site
one
npr
broke
the
news
of
the
launch
failure
on
thursday
using
images
from
commercial
satellites
that
flew
over
iran's
imam
khomeini
space
center
those
images
showed
smoke
billowing
from
the
pad
iran
has
since
acknowledged
an
accident
occurred
at
the
site
some
of
the
highest-resolution
imagery
available
commercially
comes
from
the
company
maxar
whose
worldview-
satellite
sports
centimeter
resolution
but
the
image
shown
in
the
president's
tweet
appears
to
be
of
far
better
quality
says
ankit
panda
an
adjunct
senior
fellow
at
the
federation
of
american
scientists
who
specializes
in
analyzing
satellite
imagery
the
resolution
is
amazingly
high
says
panda
i
would
think
it's
probably
below
well
below
centimeters
which
is
much
higher
than
anything
i've
ever
seen
panda
says
that
the
tweet
discloses
some
pretty
amazing
capabilities
that
the
public
simply
wasn't
privy
to
before
this
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
referred
questions
about
the
image
to
the
white
house
which
declined
to
comment
we
had
a
photo
and
i
released
it
which
i
have
the
absolute
right
to
do
the
president
told
reporters
late
friday
the
image
shows
the
aftermath
of
the
accident
which
experts
believe
took
place
while
the
rocket
was
being
fueled
clearly
visible
is
the
truck
used
to
transport
and
erect
the
rocket
and
the
words
the
product
of
national
empowerment
which
have
been
written
along
the
edge
of
the
pad
the
picture
also
shows
extensive
debris
and
charring
around
the
pad
it
was
not
entirely
clear
where
the
president's
photo
came
from
panda
believes
it
was
most
likely
taken
by
a
classified
u.s.
satellite
but
melissa
hanham
deputy
director
of
the
open
nuclear
network
at
the
one
earth
foundation
believes
that
the
resolution
is
so
high
it
may
be
beyond
the
physical
limits
at
which
satellites
can
operate
the
atmosphere
is
thick
enough
that
after
somewhere
around
to
centimeters
things
get
wonky
she
says
that
could
mean
it
was
taken
by
a
drone
or
spy
plane
though
such
a
vehicle
would
be
violating
iranian
airspace
hanham
also
says
that
the
european
company
airbus
has
been
experimenting
with
drones
that
fly
so
high
they
are
technically
outside
the
atmosphere
and
thus
operating
outside
national
boundaries
but
she
says
she
doesn't
know
whether
the
u.s.
has
such
a
system
glare
in
the
center
of
the
image
suggests
the
image
in
the
tweet
was
itself
a
photo
of
a
briefing
slide
panda
suggests
it
could
have
been
displayed
on
a
computer
screen
in
a
sensitive
compartmented
information
facility
it's
also
possible
it
was
a
photo
of
a
piece
of
paper
either
way
panda
notes
that
a
small
redaction
in
the
upper
left-hand
corner
suggests
the
intelligence
community
had
cleared
the
image
for
release
by
the
president
but
both
he
and
hanham
question
whether
releasing
it
was
a
good
idea
you
really
risk
giving
away
the
way
you
know
things
hanham
says
that
allows
people
to
adapt
and
hide
how
they
carry
out
illicit
activity
these
are
closely
held
national
secrets
panda
adds
we
don't
even
share
a
lot
of
this
kind
of
imagery
with
our
closest
allies
in
tweeting
it
out
to
the
world
trump
is
letting
iran
know
exactly
what
the
u.s.
is
capable
of
he's
also
letting
others
know
as
well
panda
says
the
russians
and
the
chinese
you're
letting
them
know
that
these
are
the
kind
of
things
that
the
united
states
has
the
capability
of
seeing
he
