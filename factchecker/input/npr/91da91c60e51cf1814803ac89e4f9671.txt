the

wednesday
for
the
second
time
in
seven
weeks
in
an
effort
to
prolong
the
decade-old
economic
expansion
in
the

rising

the

lowered
its
target
for
the

rate
by
a
quarter
percentage
point
to
a
range
of
to
president
trump
who
has
been
calling
for
deeper
rate
cuts
criticized
the
move
as
another
fail
by
the

major
stock
indexes
fell
after
the
central
bank's
announcement
but
later
recovered
the
rate
cut
which
had
been
widely
expected
by
analysts
will
trim
the
cost
of
borrowing
for
households
and
businesses
we
took
this
step
to
help
keep

economy
strong

of
some
notable

and
to
provide

risks
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
said
in
a
news
conference
chief
among
those
risks
are
slowing
growth
in
other
countries
as
well
as
the
ongoing
trade
war
both
of
which
have
reduced
exports
and
caused
american
business
owners
to
think
twice
about
spending
money
our
business
contacts
around
the
country
have
been
telling
us
that
uncertainty
about
trade
policy
has
discouraged
them
from
investing
in
their
business
powell
said
the
architect
of
that
unnerving
trade
policy
is
the
president
who
has
been
quick
to
blame
the
fed
for
the
economic
slowdown
jay
powell
and
the
federal
reserve
fail
again
trump
tweeted
after
the
fed's
statement
no
guts
no
sense
no
vision
a
terrible
communicator
the
stock
market
took
a
kinder
view
while
stocks
fell
when
the
rate
cut
was
first
announced
they
rebounded
during
the
fed
chairman's
news
conference
the

average

powell
said
he
believes
the
economic
slowdown
can
be
navigated
with
modest
adjustments
in
interest
rates
but
he
offered
reassurance
that
the
central
bank
is
ready
to
do
more
if
necessary
if
in
fact
the
economy
weakens
more
then
we're
prepared
to
be
aggressive
he
said
the
market
fell
sharply
in
july
when
the
fed
cut
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
decade
in
part
because
powell
seemed
to
suggest
that
might
be
the
last
rate
cut
for
a
while
since
then
economic
indicators
have
worsened
with
the
u.s.
imposing
new
tariffs
on
more
than
billion
in
chinese
imports
this
month
and
a
tariff
increase
scheduled
for
mid-october
two
members
of
the
fed's
rate
setting
committee
dissented
from
wednesday's
cut
preferring
to
leave
rates
unchanged
one
member
voted
for
a
more
aggressive
cut
of
a
half
percentage
point
powell
said
he
welcomed
the
range
of
views
from
his
colleagues
sometimes
the
path
ahead
is
clear
and
sometimes
less
so
he
said
we're
going
to
be
looking
carefully
meeting
by
meeting
as
we
go
and
as
i
said
we
will
act
as
appropriate
to
sustain
the
expansion
many
forecasters
are
anticipating
additional
rate
cuts
this
year
but
even
with
that
extra
push
from
the
fed
economic
growth
is
expected
to
slow
possibly
dipping
below
the
trade
war
and
slowing
growth
overseas
are
not
the
only
economic
speed
bumps
the
effects
of
the
tax
cut
are
dwindling
and
there's
growing
uncertainty
about
oil
prices
after
the
attack
over
the
weekend
in
saudi
arabia
nervous
that
a
slowing
economy
could
jeopardize
his
reelection
chances
trump
has
been
browbeating
the
fed
to
cut
interest
rates
aggressively
to
zero
or
even
lower
powell
brushed
off
the
president's
criticism
i
continue
to
believe
that
the
independence
of
the
federal
reserve
from
direct
political
control
has
served
the
public
well
over
time
powell
said
i
assure
you
that
my
colleagues
and
i
will
continue
to
conduct
monetary
policy
without
regard
to
political
considerations
it's
not
clear
that
lower
interest
rates
will
do
much
to
help
the
nation's
struggling
factories
we
see
the
driving
force
of
the
slowdown
certainly
in
manufacturing
as
trade
uncertainty
said
matthew
luzzetti
chief
u.s.
economist
at
deutsche
bank
cutting
the
fed
funds
rate
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
fully
alleviate
that
uncertainty
factories
and
other
businesses
have
cut
back
on
investment
not
because
it's
too
expensive
to
borrow
money
but
because
they're
not
sure
they
can
sell
their
products
in
that
environment
luzzetti
said
cutting
interest
rates
can
do
only
so
much
i
think
it
will
help
prop
up
confidence
it
will
help
financial
conditions
but
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
fully
offset
those
effects
he
said
mohamed
el-erian
chief
economic
adviser
at
allianz
agreed
that
cutting
interest
rates
is
unlikely
to
spur
business
investment
lower
interest
rates
would
be
like
pushing
on
a
string
he
said
what
would
help
is
an
end
to
the
trade
war
and
in
recent
days
there
have
been
signs
of
a
possible
thaw
in
trade
relations
between
the
u.s.
and
china
trump
delayed
raising
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
by
two
weeks
and
china
waived
some
tariffs
on
u.s.
farm
products
still
it's
not
clear
a
wider
trade
truce
is
imminent
right
now
that's
all
talk
said
kathy
bostjancic
chief
u.s.
financial
economist
at
oxford
economics
we
have
seen
that
before
we've
seen
encouraging
talk
and
then
both
the
markets
and
business
leaders
and
consumers
everyone
ends
up
being
disappointed
because
not
only
is
there
no
trade
truce
it
actually
ends
up
being
ratcheted
higher
