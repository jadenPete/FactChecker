during

of

earlier
this

news
organizations
now
refer
to
president
trump's
whoppers
from
the
size
of
his
inaugural
crowds
to
a
hurricane
threatening
alabama
as
routinely
as
referring
to
rain
in
seattle
but
there
was
still
some
surprise
this
week
when
at
services
to
mark
the
th
anniversary
of
the
sept
attacks
the
president
insisted
soon
after
i
went
down
to
ground
zero
with
men
who
worked
for
me
to
try
to
help
in
any
little
way
that
we
could
we
were
not
alone
so
many
others
were
scattered
around
trying
to
do
the
same
they
were
all
trying
to
help
richard
alles
battalion
chief
of
the
new
york
fire
department
at
the
time
of
the
attacks
spent
several
months
in
the
smoking
choking
ruins
at
ground
zero
he
told
politifact
this
summer
i
was
there
for
several
months
i
have
no
knowledge
of
his
being
down
there
he
added
that
there
would
be
a
record
of
donald
trump
sending
a
hundred
or
more
workers
to
aid
in
the
harrowing
recovery
efforts
at
ground
zero
there
is
not
we
might
remember
that
years
ago
the
wreckage
and
rubble
at
ground
zero
was
considered
sacred
ground
it
held
the
remains
of
thousands
of
loved
ones
including
police
and
firefighters
who
perished
as
they
tried
to
save
lives
it
was
a
place
for
rescue
and
recovery
workers
not
amateurs
gawkers
or
celebrities
producer
peter
breslow
and
i
were
in
lower
manhattan
in
the
days
following
sept
when
a
haze
of
pulverized
steel
glass
and
death
hung
in
the
air
and
scores
of
photos
of
mothers
fathers
and
lost
loved
ones
were
taped
on
buildings
and
lampposts
asking
have
you
seen
but
we
couldn't
go
past
the
security
perimeter
outside
ground
zero
my
wife
and
i
would
stand
outside
that
perimeter
along
canal
street
at
night
where
thousands
of
people
stood
to
cry
pray
and
cheer
for
the
workers
in
hard
hats
heading
in
to
do
the
hard
heavy
hazardous
work
there
there
is
a
phrase
for
the
offense
committed
by
impostors
who
wear
phony
medals
and
try
to
pose
as
combat
veterans
stolen
valor
at
a
republican
debate
in
sen
ted
cruz
decried
what
he
called
new
york
values
and
donald
trump
replied
new
york
is
a
great
place
it's
got
great
people
it's
got
loving
people
wonderful
people
when
the
world
trade
center
came
down
i
saw
something
that
no
place
on
earth
could
have
handled
more
beautifully
more
humanely
than
new
york
it
was
all
he
needed
to
say
then
and
this
week
