cajon
calif
the
california
republican

previously
represented
the
neighboring
th

in
things

certainly
changed
since
then
california's
th

currently
represented
by
duncan
hunter
a
fellow

a
decade

his
part
issa
had
been
tapped
by
president
trump
to

the
u.s.
trade
and
development
agency
but
his
nomination
stalled
for
more
than
a
year

conservative
enclave
should
have
a
chance
to
keep
it
in
republican
hands
he
deserves
his
day
in
court
issa
said
but
the
th
congressional
district
does
deserve
the
ability
to
maintain
this
as
a
conservative
district
and
quite
frankly
to
have
a
member
who
can
show
up
and
take
all
of
his
committee
assignments
issa
also
said
he
has
a
track
record
of
getting
things
done
when
i
return
i
will
continue
to
do
exactly
the
kinds
of
things
i
did
that
made
me
friends
and
enemies
issa
said
i
intend
to
continue
to
work
across
the
aisle
to
get
things
done
when
we
can
agree
one
area
he
cannot
agree
with
has
to
do
with
house
democrats
launching
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
on
trump
i
think
this
attempt
to
find
a
reason
to
impeach
the
president
is
unheard
of
and
uncalled
for
issa
said
this
activity
is
wrong
and
i
will
stand
up
to
it
when
i
return
issa
narrowly
won
his
last
race
in
defeating
his
democratic
challenger
by
roughly
votes
he
decided
to
retire
rather
than
run
again
in
as
chairman
of
the
house
oversight
and
reform
committee
issa

a
prominent
role
in
gop-led
investigations

four
americans
including
