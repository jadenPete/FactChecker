has
strategic
value
in
terms

said
a
member
of
denmark's

president
trump
may
have
been
joking
about
wanting
to
buy
greenland
if
he
said
it
but
officials
there
want
him
to
know
the
island
isn't
for
sale
aaja
chemnitz
larsen
a
greenlandic
politician
told
here
now
that
she
was
not
surprised
by
media
reports
that
the
u.s.
president
was
interested
in
purchasing
the
massive
ice-covered
island
it
sounds
a
little
bit
like
a
joke
because
greenland
is
not
for
sale
she
said
an
autonomous
danish
territory
the
island
straddles
the
arctic
and
north
atlantic
oceans
and
bridges
north
america
and
europe
it
also
has
strategic
value
in
terms
of
military
activity
and
natural
resources
said
larsen
a
member
of
the
danish
parliament
there's
a
lot
of
focus
on
the
arctic
both
because
of
climate
change
but
also
because
of
the
international
trade
war
she
says
her
remarks
followed
a
slew
of
reactions
from
leaders
and
institutions
at
the
prospect
of
trump
wanting
to
acquire
greenland
it
must
be
an
april
fool's
joke
but
totally
out
of
season

denmark's
former
prime

greenland's

stocks
seafood
renewable
energy
and

tourism
the

tweeted
we're
open
for
business
not
for

the
island's
official
government
website
saw
the
reports
as
an
expression
of
greater
interest
in
investing
in
our
country
and
the
possibilities
we
offer
the
government
said
it
was
limiting
comments
because
the
news
was
unofficial
the
wall
street
journal
citing
unnamed
sources
first
reported
on
thursday
that
trump
had
repeatedly
considered
buying
greenland
with
varying
degrees
of
seriousness
after
being
told
that
denmark
was
having
trouble
subsidizing
it
one
person
around
trump
reportedly
said
that
he
was
joking
to
show
his
wealth
but
the
idea
still
set
off
discussions
about
whether
washington
could
use
greenland
to
strengthen
the
u.s.
military
presence
in
the
arctic
according
to
the
newspaper
larsen
told
npr
that
denmark
was
not
struggling
to
financially
support
greenland
no
i
haven't
heard
that
she
said
but
she
added
we
would
like
to
have
collaboration
between
greenland
and
the
u.s.
when
it
comes
to
tourism
when
it
comes
to
extractive
industries
and
lots
of
other
things
some
republicans
defended
trump
and
the
possibility
of
greenland

some

whether
his
career

had
informed
the
