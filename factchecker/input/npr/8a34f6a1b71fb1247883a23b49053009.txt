president
trump
said
wednesday
his
administration
is
revoking
a
waiver
that
allowed
california
to
set
its
own
standards
for
automobile
emissions
a
move
that
could
derail
a
years-long
push
to
produce
more
fuel
efficient
cars
in
a
series
of
tweets
wednesday
trump
said
the
action
will
result
in
vehicles
that
are
safer
and
cheaper
and
that
there
will
be
very
little
difference
in
emissions
between
the
california
standard
and
the
new
u.s.
standard
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
telegraphed
the
planned
announcement
on
tuesday
speaking
to
the
national
automobile
dealers
association
he
said
in
the
very
near
future
the
trump
administration
will
begin
taking
the
steps
necessary
to
establish
one
set
of
national
fuel-economy
standards
the
obama-era
waiver
issued
by
the
epa
to
the
california
air
resources
board
in
allowed
the
state
to
set
stricter
air
quality
standards
than
those
imposed
at
the
federal
level
the
administration's
move
comes
after
the
department
of
justice
earlier
this
month
launched
an
antitrust
investigation
into
a
july
deal
between
california
and
four
automakers
ford
volkswagen
honda
and
bmw
and
is
seen
as
a
broader
effort
by
the
white
house
to
roll
back
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
in
the
agreement
between
the
state
and
manufacturers
on
fuel
economy
standards
which
the
administration
says
may
be
illegal
the
automakers
pledged
to
produce
passenger
vehicles
averaging
miles
per
gallon
by
model
year
which
is
in
line
with
corporate
average
fuel
economy
standards
set
by
the
obama
administration
but
the
white
house
wants
to
roll
back
the
obama-era
requirements
with
a
single
federal
guideline
that
freezes
mileage
standards
at
mpg
from
to
automakers
have
expressed
concern
about
having
two
different
standards
one
at
the
federal
level
and
another
at
the
state
level
they
have
also
welcomed
moves
to
relax
the
fuel
efficiency
standards
on
tuesday
wheeler
told
the
auto
dealers
that
the
administration
embraced
federalism
but
federalism
does
not
mean
that
one
state
can
dictate
standards
for
the
nation
the
waiver
for
california
was
meant
to
add
impetus
to
the
push
for
higher
standards
nationwide
with
the
state's
huge
car
market
it
could
force
automakers
to
comply
with
a
higher
standard
than
on
the
federal
level
or
risk
losing
a
huge
market
in
addition
other
states
have
signed
on
to
california's
standards
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
has
vowed
to
take
the
trump
administration
to
court
speaking
on
tuesday
california's
democratic
gov
gavin
newsom
said
that
while
the
white
house
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
his
state
has
stepped
up
he
said
the
white
house
move
could
have
devastating
consequences
for
our
kids
health
and
the
air
we
breathe
if
california
were
to
roll
over
but
we
will
not
in
a
statement
from
july
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
an
industry
lobby
group
said
automakers
have
said
repeatedly
that
they
support
year-over-year
increases
in
fuel
economy
standards
that
align
with
the
marketplace
while
also
advocating
for
one
national
program
california
was
accorded
special
status
in
the
clean
air
act
allowing
the
state
to
set
its
own
emissions
standards
if
it
could
convince
federal
authorities
of
the
need
to
do
so
many
of
california's
antipollution
measures
have
been
adopted
nationally
