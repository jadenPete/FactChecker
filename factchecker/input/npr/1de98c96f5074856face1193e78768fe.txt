farmers
in
the
rural
midwest
say
they
are
struggling
because
of
president
trump's
ongoing
trade
war
and
a
recent
decision
the
president
made
on
renewable
fuels
made
from
corn
and
soybeans
that
benefits
the
oil
industry
we're
tightening
our
belt
farmer
aaron
lehman
says
while
driving
his
tractor
down
a
rural
road
near
his
farm
north
of
des
moines
iowa
we're
talking
to
our
lenders
our
landlords
and
our
input
suppliers
lehman
the
president
of
the
iowa
farmers
union
says
his
members
say
they're
trying
to
find
any
way
to
cut
costs
just
to
make
ends
meet
he
says
they're
concerned
about
the
escalating
trade
war
instead
we
chose
to
insult
our
trade
allies
pick
all
sorts
of
fights
with
our
trade
allies
lehman
says
and
then
go
to
china
and
make
outrageous
demands
that
we
knew
were
not
going
to
be
met
the
trump
administration
has
doled
out
billions
of
dollars
in
relief
to
farmers
for
taking
the
brunt
of
the
trade
war
it's
an
economic
short-term
positive
deal
to
fill
a
gap
but
it
doesn't
fix
a
long-term
problem
of
not
having
access
to
foreign
markets
back
in
june
trump
came
to
council
bluffs
iowa
with
an
announcement
meant
to
calm
those
concerns
his
administration
cleared
the
way
for
higher
blends
of
corn-based
ethanol
forty
percent
of
the
united
states
corn
crop
goes

production
we
lifted
the
restrictions
on
e-
just
in

the

trump

bloomberg

did
we
can
only
talk
so
much
before
we
have
to
take
action
and
he
took
action
walton
said
we
really
saw
this
coming
he
campaigned
on
it
so
it's
no
surprise
walton
admits
that
the
negotiations
have
gone
on
longer
than
he
thought
they
would
and
that
soy

has
also
been

my
vote's
still
up

walton
says
about
the
presidential
election
economist
ernie
goss
at
creighton
university
says
his
research
shows
that
the
president's
trade
policies
are
shrinking
the
rural
economy
goss
oversees
a
monthly
survey
of
rural
bank
ceos
in
the
midwest
and
plains
seven
out
of
of
the
bankers
he
surveyed
support
either
continuing
with
the
tariffs
or
in
some
cases
raising
the
tariffs
goss
said
their
belief
is
that
the
long-term
gain
will
outweigh
the
short-term
pain
the
agriculture
economy
was
already
struggling
and
the
trade
war
is
insult
to
injury
that
won't
be
solved
overnight
says
iowa
state
university
agriculture
economist
chad
hart
trade
negotiations
especially
in
the
case
of
the
wide-ranging
issues
we
have
with
china
take
years
to
get
down
to
a
final
agreement
says
that
anxiety
is
something
that
democrats
running
for
president
like
joe
biden
are
talking
about
in
iowa
last
month
he
was
asked
what
he'd
say
to
farmers
who
are
hurting
from
the
tariffs
but
still
want
to
see
trump
making
these
deals
well
if
you
think
that's
a
good
deal
then
vote
for
trump
then
biden
told
a
group
of
reporters
after
a
campaign
stop
in
prole
iowa
but
i
don't
think
there
are
that
many
farmers
that
are
that
slow
about
things
democrats
are
hoping
to
peel
off
some
of
trump's
support
its
high
hopes
in
swing
states
like
iowa
which
went
to
the
president
by
almost
points
in
