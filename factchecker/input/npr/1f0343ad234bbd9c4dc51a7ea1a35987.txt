the
nation's
top
spy
told
lawmakers
on
thursday
that
he
supports
the
whistleblower
whose
complaint
sparked
the
ukraine
affair
but
said
he
struggled
to
deal
with
how
to
handle
the
case
inside
the
trump
administration
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
told
the
house
intelligence
committee
in
an
open
hearing
that
he
believed
the
whistleblower
and
the
spy
world's
inspector
general
had
acted
in
good
faith
and
that
he
has
tried
to
handle
a
unique
situation
as
best
he
could
i
believe
that
this
matter
is
unprecedented
maguire
said
he
stopped
short
of
characterizing
the
conduct
by
president
trump
described
in
the
complaint
and
in
a
partial
transcript
released
on
wednesday
of
a
phone
call
between
trump
and
the
president
of
ukraine
on
july
in
which
trump
asked
his
counterpart
to
investigate
the
family
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
maguire
said
he
did
not
want
to
get
into
the
middle
of
the
political
battle
i
am
not
partisan
and
i
am
not
political
he
said
i
believe
in
a
life
of
service
and
i
am
honored
to
be
a
public
servant
but
once
the
complaint
reached
him
maguire
said
the
white
house
counsel's
office
said
the
documents
appeared
to
involve
executive
privilege
which
he
said
was
beyond
his
power
to
resolve
and
which
might
mean
maguire
couldn't
give
the
documents
to
congress
later
the
justice
department
also
opined
that
the
documents
didn't
qualify
under
the
law
to
be
forwarded
to
congress
even
so
when
intelligence
community
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
told
maguire
that
he
felt
compelled
to
tell
congress
about
the
complaint
without
revealing
what
it
contained
maguire
said
he
agreed
it
is
not
perhaps
on
the
timeline
i
would
have
desired
mr
chairman
or
you
maguire
said
to
adam
schiff
d-calif
chairman
of
the
intelligence
committee
but
ultimately
maguire
said
he
believed
the
process
has
been
followed
correctly
i
believe
the
whistleblower
did
the
right
thing
he
said
ultimately
the
complaint
was
revealed
on
thursday
via
the
house
intelligence
committee
following
the
release
on
wednesday
of
the
white
house's
account
of
president
trump's
call
with
the
president
of
ukraine
democrats
miffed
schiff
pressed
maguire
as
to
why
he
approached
the
white
house
about
the
complaint
when
it
and
trump
were
the
subjects
of
that
very
complaint
and
schiff
also
asked
why
maguire
asked
the
justice
department
for
legal
advice
even
though
trump's
conversation
also
invoked
attorney
general
william
barr
that
this
whistleblower
was
left
twisting
in
the
wind
for
weeks
and
has
been
attacked
by
the
president
should
concern
all
of
us
schiff
said
the
chairman
also
stressed
that
he
believes
there's
no
ambiguity
under
the
law
and
maguire
and
his
aides
atop
the
intelligence
community
have
no
choice
but
to
give
congress
complaints
like
these
maguire
said
the
executive
privilege
aspects
of
the
complaint
meant
he
had
no
choice
and
that
as
an
executive
branch
official
he
also
was
bound
by
the
opinions
issued
by
the
justice
department's
office
of
legal
counsel
he
sought
to
stress
that
this
situation
is
unusual
and
that
he
has
been
trying
to
do
his
duty
this
was
not
swept
under
the
rug
maguire
said
temperature
rising
in
the
capital
the
house
hearing
was
watched
closely
in
a
capital
roiling
after
house
democrats
reached
a
new
consensus
this
week
about
moving
ahead
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
although
no
one
knows
what
that
may
mean
in
practical
terms
or
whether
it
will
bring
real
consequences
for
trump
existing
investigations
led
by
house
democrats
will
continue
but
the
republican-controlled
senate
remains
largely
behind
the
president
but
one
big
question
raised
by
this
week's
events
was
whether
the
action
in
the
house
and
the
revelations
from
this
week
might
move
any
of
trump's
allies
in
the
upper
chamber
key
senate
moderates
said
earlier
they
were
waiting
for
facts
to
come
through
official
channels
as
in
the
testimony
and
documents
that
are
now
public
before
making
up
their
minds
at
the
same
time
many
of
trump's
allies
as
exemplified
by
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
have
remained
stalwart
in
their
support
of
the
president
acting
dni
in
the
spotlight
the
saga
began
with
a
complaint
to
atkinson
the
intelligence
community's
internal
watchdog
about
allegedly
improper
commitments
made
by
president
trump
to
a
foreign
leader
the
complaint
was
later
released
by
the
house
intelligence
committee
read
it
here
that
led
on
wednesday
to
the
extraordinary
release
by
the
white
house
of
the
account
of
a
call
in
which
trump
asked
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
the
family
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
maguire
vowed
before
the
hearing
in
general
terms
that
he
will
do
his
duty
in
handling
the
ukraine
affair
but
he
also
denied
a
press
report
on
wednesday
that
he
had
threatened
to
resign
if
he
was
constrained
from
talking
with
lawmakers
maguire
found
himself
in
the
job
following
trump's
removal
of
the
senate-confirmed
former
dni
dan
coats
and
the
resignation
of
his
deputy
sue
gordon
there
is
no
word
as
to
when
the
white
house
might
nominate
their
full-time
replacements
so
in
the
meantime
maguire
is
caught
in
the
midst
of
the
latest
contretemps
involving
trump
the
intelligence
community
and
a
foreign
government
he
stressed
that
he
sees
himself
as
outside
the
political
arena
at
the
same
time
however
the
acting
dni
acknowledged
that
the
biggest
challenge
facing
the
intelligence
community
faces
today
is
securing
american
elections
which
bears
on
the
issue
raised
by
the
trump
phone
call
with
ukraine's
president
president
sanguine
trump
told
reporters
on
wednesday
that
he
had
at
least
one
other
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
as
did
vice
president
pence
calls
that
trump
said
were
also
innocent
trump
said
he
was
willing
to
release
a
transcript
of
those
earlier
calls
but
he
was
dismissive
about
the
reaction
by
democrats
impeachment
for
that
he
said
when
you
have
a
wonderful
meeting
a
wonderful
phone
conversation
the
president
stuck
by
his
characterization
of
what
he
called
the
real
ukraine
story
one
he
said
was
about
corruption
involving
biden
his
family
ukraine
and
china
trump
responded
to
a
question
about
whether
his
request
to
ukraine's
leader
was
improper
by
charging
that
former
president
barack
obama
and
conspirators
within
the
u.s.
government
had
persecuted
him
in
the
earlier
russia
imbroglio
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
added
on
thursday
that
the
administration
has
been
cooperating
all
along
with
revealing
the
documents
at
issue
in
the
ukraine
affair
first
the
partial
transcript
and
then
the
complaint
the
president
took
the
extraordinary
and
transparent
steps
of
releasing
the
full
unredacted
and
declassified
transcript
of
his
call
with
president
zelenskyy
which
forms
the
heart
of
the
complaint
as
well
as
the
complaint
itself
that
is
because
he
has
nothing
to
hide
she
said
in
a
statement
trump's
allies
on
the
intelligence
committee
complained
about
what
they
called
democrats
baseless
allegations
that
magquire
has
been
a
white
house
toady
ranking
member
devin
nunes
r-calif
also
blamed
what
he
called
another
conspiracy
inside
washington
aimed
at
trump
i
want
to
congratulate
the
democrats
on
the
rollout
of
their
latest
information
warfare
operation
against
the
president
he
said
biden
meanwhile
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
condemned
what
he
called
conspiracy
theorizing
by
trump
and
the
president's
supporters
the
former
vice
president
repeated
on
wednesday
his
earlier
call
that
trump
cooperate
with
congress
investigations
into
the
ukraine
affair
and
said
that
if
trump
doesn't
he'll
throw
his
support
behind
impeachment
it
is
a
tragedy
for
this
country
that
our
president
put
personal
politics
above
his
sacred
oath
biden
said
he
has
put
his
own
political
interests
over
our
national
security
interests
which
is
bolstering
ukraine
against
russian
pressure
