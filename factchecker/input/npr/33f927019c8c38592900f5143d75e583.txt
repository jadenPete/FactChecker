doesn't
get
how
they

president
trump
speaks
to
reporters
outside
the
white
house
on
wednesday
before
departing
for
kentucky
president
trump
doubled
down
wednesday
on
his
remarks
that
american
jews
who
vote
for
democrats
are
disloyal
to
israel
in
my
opinion
you
vote
for
a
democrat
you're
being
very
disloyal
to
jewish
people
and
you're
being
very
disloyal
to
israel
trump
told
reporters
outside
the
white
house
on
wednesday
and
only
weak
people
would
say
anything
other
than
that
it
was
the
second
time
in
two
days
that
the
president
questioned
the
loyalty
to
israel
of
jewish
people
who
vote
democratic
on
tuesday
he
questioned
their
smarts
too
i
think
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
i
think
it
shows
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
trump
said
from
the
oval
office
trump's
comments
display
a
lack
of
understanding
of
how
and
why
jewish
americans
vote
the
way
they
do
which
is
overwhelmingly
democratic
while
israel
is
a
threshold
issue
for
jewish
voters
it
is
not
determinative
to
the
votes
of
most
of
them
and
many
don't
agree
with
president
trump's
or
republicans
approach
to
israel
jewish
people
who
vote
democratic
care
about
what
democrats
care
about
social
justice
health
care
climate
change
the
welfare
of
immigrants
and
more
voters
who
identify
as
jewish
made
up
only
about
of
the
u.s.
electorate
in
recent
presidential
elections
but
they
have
voted
overwhelmingly
democratic
since
in
fact
jewish
voters
have
voted
on
average
for
democrats
that
was
the
exact
number
that
went
for
hillary
clinton
in
their
voting
power
in
presidential
elections
can
be
felt
in
competitive
states
like
in
south
florida
the
north
philadelphia
suburbs
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
pittsburgh
las
vegas
cleveland
detroit
and
outside
atlanta
and
denver
trump
hopes
to
peel
off
some
jewish
voters
in
what's
expected
to
be
a
close
reelection
fight
he's
trying
to
highlight
comments
by
democratic
reps
ilhan
omar
of
minnesota
and
rashida
tlaib
of
michigan
who
have
been
hotly
critical
of
israel
omar
in
particular
has
been
criticized
for
some
of
her
remarks
democratic
leaders
and
many
rank-and-file
democratic
elected
officials
have
tried
to
distance
themselves
from
their
views
trump
though
has
tried
to
as
he
says
make
the
congresswomen
the
face
of
the
democratic
party
in
an
attempt
to
help
him
next
year
but
his
strategy
of
highlighting
democrats
not
walking
in
lockstep
with
israel
has
been
tried
before
to
no
avail
for
republicans
think
president
barack
obama's
nuclear
deal
with
iran
or
his
criticism
of
israeli
settlement
expansion
obama
still
won
of
the
jewish
vote
in
and
in
what's
more
jewish
voters
went
for
democrats
in
the
midterms
by
an
even
higher
percentage
and
that
was
after
trump
moved
the
u.s.
embassy
in
israel
to
jerusalem
we
see
evidence
that
it
the
jewish
vote
is
moving
even
more
towards
democrats
now
during
trump's
presidency
said
jim
gerstein
a
democratic
pollster
he
added
that
american
jews
don't
even
necessarily
agree
with
trump's
policies
toward
israel
and
they
have
other
concerns
they're
so
hostile
to
trump
himself
because
of
all
the
immigration
issues
and
white
nationalism
and
the
rise
of
anti-semitism
all
that
makes
them
so
hostile
to
him
that
anything
he
says
or
does
doesn't
matter
even
if
they
were
to
agree
with
it
said
gerstein
who
called
views
of
israel
a
threshold
issue
for
jewish
voters
but
they
don't
necessarily
agree
with
him
on
the
israel
stuff
to
begin
with
jewish
voters
like
catholics
vote
less
based
on
religion
but
more
reliably
on
their
partisan
identification
in
other
words
if
someone
is
a
republican
they
vote
like
one
and
vice
versa
disloyalty
a
centuries-old
anti-semitic
idea
the
disloyalty
claim
reminds
some
of
an
anti-semitic
trope
this
loyalty
claim
or
disloyalty
claim
is
actually
a
centuries-old
anti-semitic
idea
that
dates
back
to
european
monarchies
said
rabbi
alissa
wise
deputy
director
of
jewish
voice
for
peace
this
idea
that
jews
are
somehow
disloyal
to
or
have
more
loyalty
to
an
entity
outside
of
the
state
to
which
they
live
it's
something
for
which
omar
also
faced
criticism
in
february
when
she
said
i
want
to
talk
about
the
political
influence
in
this
country
that
says
it
is
ok
for
people
to
push
for
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country
the
trump
campaign
argues
that
democrats
are
the
ones
who
embrace
and
defend
the
most
vitriolic
anti-semites
in
their
midst
and
are
excusing
and
permitting
such
anti-jewish
venom
to
be
spewed
so
freely
said
michael
glassner
the
trump
campaign's
chief
operating
officer
in
a
statement
trump's
comments
wednesday
also
came
a
day
after
he
referred
to
omar
and
tlaib
when
he
said
where
has
the
democratic
party
gone
where
they're
defending
these
two
people
over
the
state
of
israel
trump's
remarks
prompted
a
conservative
radio
host
to
call
him
the
king
of
israel
a
comment
that
trump
retweeted
under
pressure
tlaib
and
omar
were
initially
denied
entry
into
israel
for
a
planned
trip
earlier
this
month
because
of
their
support
for
boycotts
of
the
country
the
decision
from
israel
came
after
trump
urged
it
he
all
but
taunted
israel
saying
it
would
show
great
weakness
if
israel
let
the
two
american
congresswomen
in
israel
relented
and
said
it
would
allow
tlaib
entry
to
see
her
grandmother
on
the
west
bank
as
long
as
she
didn't
voice
support
for
boycotts
on
her
trip
tlaib
decided
she
would
not
go
and
called
the
conditions
oppressive
in
a
teary-eyed
news
conference
monday
tlaib
accused
israel's
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
of
taking
a
page
out
of
trump's
book
meanwhile
democrats
in
the
house
who
don't
always
agree
with
omar
and
tlaib
are
furious
with
israel's
ambassador
to
the
united
states
ron
dermer
for
his
role
in
the
controversy
the
jerusalem
post
reported
democrats
may
not
take
any
more
meetings
with
him
the
paper
reported
especially
after
democratic
leaders
thought
they
had
gotten
assurances
that
the
two
congresswomen
would
be
allowed
to
travel
there
has
long
been
a
degree
of
distrust
between
democrats
and
dermer
because
he
had
worked
as
a
republican
operative
and
helped
orchestrate
netanyahu's
speech
to
congress
in
when
republican
john
boehner
was
speaker
in
which
netanyahu
criticized
then-president
obama's
policy
toward
iran
the
trump
campaign
apparatus
went
into
overdrive
on
the
subject
wednesday
kayleigh
mcenany
a
campaign
spokeswoman
blasted
the
bds
movement
which
seeks
boycott
divestment
sanctions
of
israel
as
well
as
an
end
to
international
support
because
of
israel's
treatment
of
palestinians
it
is
an
actual
movement
that
seeks
to
destroy
the
state
of
israel
by
boycotting
them
she
said
wednesday
on
fox
news
it
is
the
same
goal
as
iran
who
wants
to
wipe
israel
off
the
face
of
the
map
it
is
an
anti-semitic
movement
it
is
disgusting
but
are
trump
and
his
campaign's
actions
about
winning
over
jewish
voters
at
all
jeremy
ben-ami
of
the
progressive
jewish
lobbying
group
j-street
doesn't
think
so
they
seem
more
aimed
at
exciting
the
trump
base
ben-ami
said
israel
is
an
issue
not
simply
for
the
jewish
community
he
noted
it
is
an
evangelical
issue
it's
an
issue
in
many
red
states
and
it
is
comparable
as
a
cultural
divide
on
things
like
guns
abortion
and
other
culture
war
issues
trump
has
certainly
sought
to
use
cultural
grievances
as
a
way
to
keep
his
base
on
board
throughout
his
presidency
and
if
that
happens
to
peel
away
some
voters
in
the
process
or
make
them
stay
home
all
the
better
