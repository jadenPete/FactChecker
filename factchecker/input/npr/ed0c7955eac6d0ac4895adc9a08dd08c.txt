the

weeks
later
in

introducing
him
to

i
honestly
don't
know
what
to
do
i've
become
addicted
to
drugs
and
the
worst
one
at
that
moore
wrote
according

mother
latisha
nixon
filed
a
wrongful

lawsuit
against

county
officials
she
says
dean's
death
could
have
been
avoided
if
authorities
had
charged
buck
in
for
more
than
two
years
activists
have
said
buck
wasn't
charged
with
a
crime
because
he
is
white
wealthy
and
politically
connected
now
they're
welcoming
news
that
he
has
been
arrested
we're
just

to
stop
a
violent
predator
says
she
has
collected
a
trove
of
evidence
against
buck
publishing
interviews
and
other
materials
online
the
next
step
in
her
view
is
for
him
to
face
additional
charges
related

the
deaths
of
moore
and
dean
after
dean
died
earlier
this
year

is
innocent
of
any
crimes
this
is
not
a
situation
where
mr
buck
has
caused
a
death
amster
said
this
is
a
situation
where
mr
buck
has
had
longtime
friends
who
unfortunately
do
not
handle
their
life
well
prosecutors
are
recommending
that
bail
for
buck
should
be
set
at

i
remain
deeply
concerned
