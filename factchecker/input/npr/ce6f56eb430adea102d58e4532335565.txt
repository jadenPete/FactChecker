inquiry

tuesday
on

updated
at
p

et
after
months
of
expressing
caution
on
a
push
for
impeachment
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
launched
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
trump
tuesday
the
president
must
be
held
accountable
pelosi
said
no
one
is
above
the
law
the
landmark
move
comes
after
controversy
over
a
phone
call
trump
had
with
the
newly
elected
ukranian
leader
in
july
and
reporting
that
the
president
pressured
him
to
investigate
political
rival
joe
biden
the
actions
of
the
trump
presidency
revealed
the
dishonorable
fact
of
the
president's
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
betrayal
of
our
national
security
and
betrayal
of
the
integrity
of
our
elections
pelosi
said
therefore
today
i
am
announcing
the
house
of
representatives
moving
forward
with
an
official
impeachment
inquiry
i
am
directing
our
six
committees
to
proceed
with
their
investigations
under
that
umbrella
of
impeachment
inquiry
trump
earlier
tuesday
called
the
allegations
against
him
ridiculous
and
a
witch
hunt
he
contended
he
did
nothing
wrong
and
is
promising
to
release
a
transcript
of
the
call
wednesday
he
also
tweeted
during
and
after
pelosi's
announcement
again
calling
it
a
witch
hunt
and
presidential
harassment
the
formal
impeachment
announcement
amounts
to
a
political
earthquake
in
washington
only
three
presidents
before
trump
have
faced
impeachment
proceedings
andrew
johnson
richard
nixon
and
bill
clinton
nixon
resigned
from
office
to
avoid
being
impeached
impeachment
can
have
the
effect
of
all
other
business
in
congress
grinding
to
a
halt
there
was
a
push
for
example
to
pass
new
gun
restrictions
after
a
spate
of
mass
shootings
but
the
future
of
any
movement
on
that
is
now
unclear
formal
impeachment
proceedings
would
very
likely
take
months
if
the
house
does
in
fact
impeach
the
president
it
would
move
to
the
senate
to
contemplate
his
removal
which
means
the
potential
for
senate
impeachment
hearings
in
a
presidential
election
year
and
likely
in
the
middle
of
the
democratic
primaries
momentum
for
launching
an
impeachment
inquiry
took
off
throughout
the
day
tuesday
with
notable
and
significant
house
democrats
coming
out
in
favor
of
it
civil
rights
icon

now
is

i
have

while
we

the

dictated

the

at

i
believe
i
truly
believe
the
time

begin
impeachment
proceedings
against
this
president
has
come
to
delay
or
to

otherwise

lewis
is
often
a
bellwether
for

his

trump's
unprecedented
actions
are
escalating
asked
why
not
wait
until
november
when
voters
can
weigh
in
she
said
i
do
not
think
we
have
that
luxury
of

i
think
these
actions
are
getting
worse
and
worse
and
when
we
don't
hold
him
accountable
they
will
only
continue
to
get
worse
she
continued
and
i
don't
think
we
have
the
luxury
of
november

when
we
are

he
is
using
the
awesome

of

potentially
extort

i
mean
this
is
unprecedented
earlier
seven
house
democrats
who
represent
competitive
districts
pushed

if

turns

get
pulled

go

do
it
she
said
and
i've
been
pulled
over
by
just
as
many
people
saying
please
don't
do
it
but
she
added
no
matter
whether
you're
a
democrat
or
an
independent
or
a
republican
the
idea
that
a
sitting
president
would
attempt
to
leverage
dirt
on
a
political
opponent
from
a
foreign
leader
is
just
beyond
the
pale
it's
a
game-changer
it's
something
different
and
we
have
to
acknowledge
it
as
thus
pelosi
met
with
her
democratic
caucus
tuesday
afternoon
and
spoke
to
reporters
after
that
a
slim
majority
of
house
democrats
were
already
in
favor
of
beginning
impeachment
proceedings
before
the
ukraine
call
incident
which
stemmed
from
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
intelligence
community
even
more
democrats
have
come
out
in
favor
since
and
that
number
could
rise
after
reporting
late
monday
night
from
multiple
outlets
that
the
president
ordered
million
in
potential
aid
to
ukraine
to
be
held
back
before
the
phone
call
with
the
ukrainian
leader
trump
reportedly
pressured
the
ukrainian
leader
to
investigate
biden
and
his
son
hunter
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
in
a
july
phone
call
trump
denied
that
allegation
tuesday
morning
before
a
speech
to
the
u.n.
general
assembly
i
think
it's
ridiculous
trump
said
it's
a
witch
hunt
trump
admitted
that
he
put
a
hold
on
money
to
ukraine
but
he
denied
it
had
anything
to
do
with
wanting
ukraine
to
investigate
biden
instead
he
did
it
he
said
because
very
important
very
important
i
want
other
countries
to
put
up
money
i
think
it's
unfair
that
we
put
up
the
money
but
then
people
call
me
and
they
say
oh
let
it
go
and
i
let
it
go
he
added
in
response
to
a
reporter's
question
during
a
bilateral
meeting
with
u.k.
prime
minister
boris
johnson
that
there
was
never
a
quid
pro
quo
for
holding
aid
to
ukraine
three
democratic
committee
chairmen
released
a
letter
tuesday
to
white
house
counsel
pat
cipollone
arguing
that
an
explicit
quid
pro
quo
doesn't
matter
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
oversight
chairman
elijah
cummings
and
foreign
affairs
chairman
eliot
l.
engel
wrote
that
ukraine
depends
on
u.s.
aid
and
is
under
continued
threat
from
russia
it
is
therefore
particularly
vulnerable
to
pressure
from
a
u.s.
president
they
wrote
in
the
letter
demanding
that
documents
related
to
the
ukraine
call
be
released
exploiting
that
vulnerability
to
advance
the
president's
personal
political
interests
whether
or
not
the
president
ever
expressly
tied
his
request
to
a
quid
pro
quo
subverts
the
constitutional
duties
he
is
sworn
to
uphold
and
presents
an
acute
crisis
for
our
democracy
pelosi
echoed
that
during
a
panel
with
the
atlantic
in
washington
it's
really
important
to
know
this
she
said
there
is
no
requirement
there
be
a
quid
pro
quo
in
the
conversation
asked
if
trump
did
what
he
is
alleged
to
have
done
would
it
be
impeachable
pelosi
said
if
that
is
the
case
that
he
asked
a
foreign
government
to
assist
him
in
any
way
that
would
be
and
she
paused
for
effect
wrong
trump
added
that
he
assumes
people
will
see
a
readout
of
the
call
with
the
ukrainian
leader
and
that
call
was
perfect
he
said
asserting
there
was
no
pressure
put
on
them
whatsoever
later
in
the
day
trump
tweeted
a
promise
to
release
the
transcript
of
the
call
wednesday
schiff
tuesday
afternoon
tweeted
that
his
committee
has
been
informed
that
the
whistleblower
wants
to
testify
and
that
it
could
be
as
soon
as
this
week
the
senate
tuesday
afternoon
passed
by
unanimous
consent
a
resolution
that
the
whistleblower
complaint
should
be
transmitted
immediately
to
intelligence
committee
the
resolution
had
been
pushed
by
democratic
senate
leader
chuck
schumer
of
new
york
trump
contended
at
the
u.n.
that
the
pressure
was
put
on
by
joe
biden
what
joe
biden
did
for
his
son
that's
something
they
should
be
looking
at
the
allegation
popular
in
conservative
media
circles
has
been
looked
at
and
there
is
no
evidence
the
bidens
did
anything
wrong
something
that
has
been
fact-checked
by
multiple
news
outlets
as
part
of
obama
administration
policy
in
an
effort
agreed
to
by
other
western
alliance
countries
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
world
bank
biden
threatened
to
hold
up
funding
to
ukraine
unless
a
prosecutor
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
widespread
corruption
was
ousted
the
then-vice
president
was
sent
to
ukraine
with
that
message
and
it
worked
it's
not
something
biden
tried
to
hide
he
in
fact
touted
it
last
year
as
npr's
lucian
kim
reported
from
kyiv
on
tuesday
morning
the
allegations
of
corruption
against
the
gas
company
burisma
predated
hunter
biden's
joining
its
board
in
fact
kim
reported
burisma
brought
hunter
biden
on
board
in
an
effort
to
look
like
it
was
cleaning
up
its
act
and
many
in
ukraine
credit
joe
biden
with
helping
in
the
effort
to
clean
up
corruption
in
the
country
without
hunter
biden
there
would
be
no
story
here
brian
bonner
chief
editor
of
the
kyiv
post
said
on
morning
edition
hunter
biden
looks
like
he
was
trying
to
cash
in
but
bonner
added
biden
as
vice
president
did
not
try
to
kill
the
investigation
into
burisma
in
fact
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
prosecutor
general
was
fired
was
because
he
obstructed
one
corruption
case
after
another
he
prosecuted
no
one
for
corruption
he
protected
corruption
the
president's
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
has
admitted
pressuring
ukrainian
officials
to
investigate
biden
and
met
with
one
official
in
madrid
in
an
encounter
set
up
by
the
state
department
he
told
the
wall
street
journal
trump
is
trying
to
sell
that
he
is
the
victim
here
a
tactic
he
has
employed
many
times
before
to
show
solidarity
in
grievance
with
his
political
base
but
this
behavior
if
true
is
something
even
republicans
are
saying
would
have
been
inappropriate
the
issue
however
is
that
the
trump
administration
controls
much
of
the
information
that
would
answer
many
of
the
questions
reporters
and
congress
are
asking
the
administration
has
not
released
the
whistleblower
complaint
publicly
or
even
to
congress
and
members
of
his
administration
have
resisted
releasing
any
transcript
of
the
call
trump
had
with
the
ukrainian
leader
citing
the
precedent
it
could
set
all
of
that
gives
a
degree
of
political
cover
to
republicans
they
can
say
if
true
it
would
be
inappropriate
but
more
information
is
needed
and
yet
that
information
is
controlled
by
the
executive
branch
and
if
it's
never
released
it
allows
republicans
to
continue
not
criticizing
him
and
hope
the
controversy
fades
but
for
democrats
even
this
new
group
of
moderates
they
are
putting
the
responsibility
on
the
administration
to
prove
the
president
did
nothing
untoward
the
onus
is
on
them
in
the
administration
to
prove
that
there
wasn't
some
serious
wrongdoing
here
given
that
the
president's
lawyer
said
it
openly
slotkin
said
he
admitted
it
so
the
onus
is
on
them
otherwise
i
think
we
know
we
need
to
move
to
another
tack
here
