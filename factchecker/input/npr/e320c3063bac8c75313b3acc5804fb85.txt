national
security
adviser
john
bolton
left
the
trump
administration
earlier
this
week
to
work
at
the
pleasure
of
president
trump
is
to
never
know
when
your
last
day
will
come
and
whether
the
exit
will
be
on
your
own
terms
national
security
adviser
john
bolton's
resignation
this
week
or
was
it
a
firing
is
just
the
latest
example
when
former
undersecretary
of
state
steve
goldstein
woke
up
on
the
morning
of
march
he
didn't
know
he
was
about
to
be
fired
he
went
to
the
gym
and
rowed
meters
on
the
indoor
rower
the
longest
he
had
ever
done
then
things
went
south
i
think
when
you
first
get
fired
and
especially
in
my
case
where
i
saw
it
unfold
on
cnn
and
then
got
a
call
from
the
white
house
it
is
rather
shocking
goldstein
said
goldstein's
boss
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
had
been
forced
out
that
morning
after
months
of
rumors
about
a
breakdown
of
his
relationship
with
trump
the
announcement
came
via
tweet
as
they
often
do
but
tillerson
didn't
go
quietly
goldstein
put
out
a
statement
on
his
behalf
contradicting
the
official
account
of
the
firing
and
saying
the
secretary
did
not
speak
to
the
president
this
morning
and
is
unaware
of
the
reason
and
then
goldstein
himself
was
fired
after
just
three
months
on
the
job
you
know
going
into
it
that
that
can
happen
goldstein
said
i
mean
i
wasn't
naive
to
this
and
honestly
it
is
the
purview
of
the
president
to
have
whomever
he
or
she
chooses
to
have
work
for
them
but
this
very
uncertainty
is
contributing
to
the
high
number
of
vacancies
in
the
trump
administration
and
the
increasing
length
of
time
it's
taking
to
get
someone
permanent
or
as
permanent
as
anyone
can
be
into
these
key
roles
there
has
been
a
dramatic
uptick
in
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
the
trump
administration
to
fill
cabinet
and
high-level
staff
vacancies
and
there
has
been
a
proliferation
of
people
in
acting
roles
with
no
end
in
sight
an
npr
analysis
finds
that
since
david
shulkin's
forced
resignation
as
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
in
late
march
none
of
the
cabinet-level
vacancies
have
had
new
leaders
confirmed
in
fewer
than
days
but
the
hang-up
isn't
in
congress
it
is
taking
trump
longer
to
name
successors
for
ousted
aides
and
agency
heads
and
several
of
his
initial
picks
have
had
to
withdraw
of
the
departures
announced
in
the
past
five
months
only
one
has
a
successor
named
and
formally
nominated
don't
see
the
graphic
above
click
here
there
is
a
very
small
recruiting
pool
of
people
that
are
acceptable
to
president
trump
and
individuals
who
have
had
requisite
experience
that
would
want
these
jobs
said
kathryn
dunn
tenpas
a
researcher
who
specializes
in
white
house
staff
turnover
at
the
brookings
institution
that
in
combination
with
his
impulsive
nature
and
his
tendency
to
fire
people
more
than
any
other
president
that
i've
studied
means
that
there's
going
to
be
vacancies
for
a
long
period
of
time
on
multiple
occasions
trump
has
said
people
are
clamoring
to
work
in
his
administration
i
have
five
people
that
want
it
very
much
i
mean
a
lot
more
than
that
would
like
to
have
it
trump
said
wednesday
of
possible
replacements
for
bolton
we'll
be
announcing
somebody
next
week
but
we
have
some
highly
qualified
people
he
made
a
similar
claim
last
december
about
replacing
john
kelly
as
chief
of
staff
we
have
a
lot
of
people
that
want
the
job
chief
of
staff
trump
said
over
a
period
of
a
week
or
two
or
maybe
less
we'll
announce
who
it's
going
to
be
instead
a
few
days
later
he
announced
that
mick
mulvaney
the
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
would
serve
as
acting
chief
of
staff
more
than
days
later
mulvaney
is
still
acting
as
is
russell
vought
who
is
the
acting
budget
director
on
aug
trump
said
a
new
director
of
national
intelligence
would
be
named
shortly
after
dan
coats
left
the
post
and
trump's
initial
pick
ran
into
vetting
problems
and
withdrew
from
consideration
that's
a
job
that
everybody
wants
trump
boasted
but
more
than
a
month
later
there's
an
acting
director
and
no
indication
that
trump
will
name
a
permanent
pick
anytime
soon
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
acting
is
good
trump
recently
said
when
asked
about
the
high
number
of
people
in
seemingly
unending
acting
roles
acting
gives
you
great
flexibility
that
you
don't
have
with
permanent
so
i'm
ok
with
the
word
acting
but
when
i
like
people
i
make
them
permanent
but
i
can
leave
acting
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
he
has
the
secretary
of
defense
was
acting
for
more
than
six
months
the
longest
period
of
vacancy
in
history
for
that
critical
role
there's
never
been
this
many
acting
simultaneously
in
these
highly
visible
positions
tenpas
says
one
reason
is
that
departures
in
the
trump
administration
are
rarely
planned
events
especially
recently
former
secretary
of
defense
jim
mattis
resigned
suddenly
over
a
policy
disagreement
and
then
trump
asked
him
to
leave
the
post
before
a
replacement
could
be
identified
homeland
security
secretary
kirstjen
nielsen
was
forced
out
in
april
a
permanent
successor
still
hasn't
been
named
and
kevin
mcaleenan
continues
doing
the
job
with
acting
ahead
of
the
title
it
has
been
days
since
she
left
when
secretary
of
labor
alex
acosta
resigned
in
july
amid
controversy
over
his
handling
of
the
jeffrey
epstein
case
years
earlier
in
florida
it
didn't
take
trump
long
to
name
his
pick
for
a
replacement
it
was
less
than
a
week
later
when
he
announced
eugene
scalia
would
be
nominated
for
the
role
but
it
took
two
months
for
the
white
house
to
formally
send
the
nomination
up
to
capitol
hill
just
yesterday
why
would
it
take
so
long
because
the
confirmation
process
requires
a
lot
of
vetting
and
paperwork
which
is
hard
to
do
in
advance
if
the
resignations
and
firings
aren't
planned
for
for
those
who
answer
the
call
to
serve
in
the
trump
administration
the
jobs
are
more
ephemeral
than
in
past
administrations
and
there's
a
decent
chance
of
leaving
with
a
dash
of
reputational
damage
i
can't
say
that
anybody's
reputation
has
been
enhanced
and
i
can
point
out
a
number
of
people
who
look
a
lot
worse
after
having
worked
for
president
trump
said
tenpas
of
the
brookings
institution
as
tenpas
has
tracked
firings
and
transitions
in
the
trump
administration
she
has
run
out
of
superlatives
and
space
in
her
chart
on
staff
turnover
in
past
administrations
she
created
a
new
chart
just
to
track
serial
turnover
when
a
senior
position
has
been
held
by
three
or
more
individuals
this
is
a
new
chart
because
it's
never
happened
before
i
had
no
reason
to
make
this
chart
tenpas
said
the
national
security
adviser
white
house
chief
of
staff
and
communications
director
positions
have
all
experienced
serial
turnover
but
there's
also
something
in
the
way
administration
departures
have
happened
at
both
the
staff
and
cabinet
level
suddenly
publicly
playing
out
with
breaking
news
alerts
on
cable
often
without
a
well-vetted
replacement
ready
to
take
the
job
looking
back
through
her
data
and
studying
other
presidents
tenpas
reached
the
conclusion
that
there's
never
been
so
many
highly
visible
departures
or
people
fired
under
unfavorable
circumstances
and
resigning
under
pressure
this
raises
the
question
goldstein
says
he
has
been
asked
just
about
every
day
since
leaving
the
state
department
why
did
you
go
to
washington
to
serve
in
the
trump
administration
especially
knowing
that
it
could
end
the
way
it
did
his
answer
is
this
he
felt
like
they
were
able
to
accomplish
good
things
during
his
short
tenure
and
i
do
fundamentally
believe
that
you
have
an
obligation
to
serve
your
country
and
until
you
are
put
in
that
position
where
you're
asked
to
serve
you
don't
know
what
your
answer
would
be
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
later
there
still
hasn't
been
anyone
nominated
to
fill
the
position
goldstein
held
undersecretary
of
state
for
public
diplomacy
