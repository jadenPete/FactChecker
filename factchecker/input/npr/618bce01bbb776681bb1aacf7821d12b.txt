the
trump
administration
is
moving
forward
with
a
wave
of
new
rules
and
regulations
that
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
low-income
americans
especially
those
in
families
that
include
non-citizens
to
get
government
aid
npr
detailed
many
of
the
proposals
in
june
but
there
have
been
several
developments
since
then
most
of
the
proposed
changes
do
not
require
congressional
action
but
opponents
have
vowed
to
fight
several
of
them
in
court
democrats
in
congress
are
also
trying
to
prevent
the
administration
from
implementing
some
of
the
new
rules
by
cutting
off
funds
president
trump
has
justified
his
actions
by
saying
that
he
wants
those
receiving
government
help
to
become
more
self-sufficient
and
to
move
into
the
workforce
especially
with
unemployment
at
a
near-record
low
he
issued
an
executive
order
last
year
calling
on
all
federal
agencies
to
help
reduce
poverty
by
promoting
opportunity
and
economic
mobility
he
directed
agencies
to
streamline
existing
welfare
programs
strengthen
work
requirements
and
make
sure
that
taxpayer
money
is
spent
on
those
who
are
truly
in
need
anti-poverty
advocates
counter
that
the
proposals
would
hurt
rather
than
help
poor
americans
they
say
it
will
make
it
more
difficult
for
those
trying
to
become
self-sufficient
by
denying
them
food
housing
and
medical
assistance
when
they
need
it
most
opponents
also
argue
that
some
of
the
changes
are
intended
to
restrict
legal
immigration
something
the
administration
has
been
unable
to
do
through
legislation
here's
the
latest
on
some
of
the
main
proposals
food
aid
payday
loans
poverty
line
immigration
housing
medicaid
work
requirement
