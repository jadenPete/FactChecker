president

will

heading
behind
enemy
lines
as
one
supporter
called
the
president's
first
trip
to
the
san
francisco
bay
area
since
being
elected
even
so
trump's
re-election
campaign
and
republican
party
coffers
will
be
stuffed
with
cash
when
he
leaves
the
state
on
wednesday
while
trump
is
treated
as
a
kind
of
devil
incarnate
by
democratic
officials
and
many
of
the
state's
voters
he's
not
without
support
even
in
deep-blue
california
he's
very
popular
here
said
republican
national
committeewoman
harmeet
dhillon
from
san
francisco
it
was
dhillon
who
described
california
as
the
enemy
in
a
recent
new
york
times
article
but
as
one
of
the
organizers
of
tuesday's
lunchtime
fundraiser
she's
found
plenty
of
friends
of
the
president
here
the
event
is
sold
out
and
i
could
have
sold
more
seats
if
i
had
them
dhillon
said
she
wouldn't
disclose
the
exact
location
of
the
event
citing
security
reasons
but
said
it's
somewhere
south
of
san
francisco
and
will
attract
a
few
hundred
people
some
paying
or
more
for
a
chance
to
see
trump
in
person
she
noted
that
donors
will
be
attending
from
as
far
away
as
reno
nev
as
well
as
from
yuba
kings
and
sacramento
counties
trump
will
head
to
a
similar
fundraiser
in
beverly
hills
tuesday
afternoon
asked
what
california
donors
like
about
trump
dhillon
listed
his
taking
the
fight
to
democrats
unlike
these
rinos
republican
in
name
only
in
washington
d.c.
and
also
his
america
first
rhetoric
and
tax
cuts
although
she
acknowledged
many
wealthy
californians
are
unhappy
about
the
gop
tax
bill
which
places
limits
on
allowable
federal
deductions
for
state
and
local
taxes
dhillon
who
was
born
in
india
added
that
some
immigrants
like
me
really
like
his
positions
on
illegal
immigration
blaming
democrats
for
california's
homeless
crisis
although
the
administration
isn't
saying
much
about
the
president's
upcoming
remarks
trump
is
sure
to
use
his
california
visit
to
continue
bashing
the
state's
liberal
policies
which
he
says
have
contributed
to
the
number
of
homeless
people
on
the
streets
last
week
trump
administration
officials
visited
los
angeles
to
inspect
the
city's
infamous
skid
row
there
were
reports
the
officials
also
toured
federal
facilities
that
could
potentially
be
used
to
house
the
homeless
while
that
might
sound
good
to
democrats
coming
from
say
former
president
barack
obama
anything
this
president
does
is
viewed
with
grave
suspicion
by
his
political
opponents
in
california
democratic
gov
gavin
newsom
on
monday
released
a
pointed
letter
to
the
president
suggesting
that
if
he
really
wanted
to
address
homelessness
he
would
help
californians
get
out
of
poverty
and
invest
in
things
like
mental
health
and
affordable
housing
in
contrast
newsom
wrote
your
administration
has
proposed
significant
cuts
to
public
housing
and
programs
like
the
community
development
block
grant
the
letter
signed
by
sacramento
mayor
darrell
steinberg
on
behalf
of
big
city
mayors
suggests
three
specific
steps
to
help
prevent
homelessness
including
providing
more
vouchers
to
provide
rental
subsidies
for
the
poor
and
an
increase
in
the
value
of
the
vouchers
to
reflect
the
high
cost
of
housing
in
california
at
a
press
conference
in
sacramento
monday
newsom
said
the
letter
was
sent
not
with
a
clenched
fist
but
an
open
hand
while
trump
is
not
expected
to
go
to
san
francisco
proper
ben
carson
his
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
will
visit
the
city
tuesday
san
francisco's
coordinator
of
homeless
programs
jeff
kozitsky
told
kqed
he
believes
carson
will
visit
a
hope
sf
public
housing
development
in
the
potrero
hill
neighborhood
where
local
bond
money
and
federal
funds
have
been
used
to
rebuild
dilapidated
housing
for
low-income
san
franciscans
kozitsky
who
has
met
with
carson
previously
said
he
welcomes
more
federal
attention
to
the
homeless
problem
which
has
festered
and
frustrated
city
officials
and
residents
for
decades
we
really
need
to
refocus
our
energy
on
the
root
cause
of
this
problem
which
is
a
lack
of
affordable
housing
kozitsky
said
in
terms
of
practical
things
that
the
government
could
be
doing
right
here
right
now
investing
more
in
affordable
housing
is
what's
really
needed
if
we're
ever
going
to
get
a
handle
on
this
nationally
that
sentiment
was
echoed
by
san
francisco
mayor
london
breed
who
has
tried
with
mixed
results
to
lower
barriers
to
construction
of
affordable
housing
in
a
city
where
citizen
objections
can
slow
shrink
or
even
kill
affordable
housing
projects
i'm
open
to
anything
that's
going
to
help
get
people
permanently
housed
breed
said
what
that
entails
from
my
perspective
is
getting
more
housing
built
and
providing
subsidies
to
get
housing
built
it
takes
money
to
get
them
built
