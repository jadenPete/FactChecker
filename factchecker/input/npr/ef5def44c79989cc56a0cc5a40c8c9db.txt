a
sign
for
flu
shots
at
a
cvs
pharmacy
in
boston
it's
flu
shot
season
signs
alerting
and
urging
you
to
get
a
flu
shot
now
may
be
up
at
your
pharmacy
or
workplace
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
recommends
everyone
over
months
old
get
a
flu
shot
by
the
end
of
october
so
the
vaccine
can
begin
to
work
before
the
influenza
season
begins
but
this
week
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
said
it
would
not
give
flu
shots
to
the
thousands
of
migrants
now
in
its
detention
centers
due
to
the
short-term
nature
of
cbp
holding
and
the
complexities
of
operating
vaccination
programs
the
agency
said
in
a
statement
neither
cbp
nor
its
medical
contractors
administer
vaccinations
to
those
in
our
custody
dr
bruce
y.
lee
of
the
johns
hopkins
bloomberg
school
of
public
health
called
the
department's
edict
short-term
thinking
holding
a
number
of
unvaccinated
people
in
a
crowded
space
could
be
like
maintaining
an
amusement
park
for
flu
viruses
he
wrote
for
forbes
he
explains
that
viruses
could
spread
through
the
congested
often
cold
and
unsanitary
detention
camps
and
get
passed
between
those
people
who've
been
detained
weak
tired
and
dusty
as
well
as
those
who
work
there
viruses
spread
they
cannot
be
detained
like
people
during
a
particularly
brutal
flu
season
two
years
ago
the
cdc
estimated
about
people
including
children
died
across
the
u.s.
after
being
infected
by
influenza
last
season's
flu
set
records
for
its
length
lasting
weeks
on
aug
a
group
of
six
physicians
from
johns
hopkins
and
the
massgeneral
hospital
for
children
wrote
a
letter
to
members
of
congress
in
which
they
said
at
least
three
children
infected
with
influenza
have
died
in
u.s.
custody
since
december
of
the
children
were
and
they
were
named
wilmer
felipe
and
carlos
the
doctors
advised
congress
during
the
influenza
season
vaccination
should
be
offered
to
all
detainees
promptly
upon
arrival
in
order
to
maximize
protection
for
the
youngest
and
most
vulnerable
detainees
this
week
i
read
of
the
government's
determination
not
to
give
seasonal
flu
shots
to
migrants
in
detention
centers
and
had
to
ask
what
possible
good
will
this
do
is
it
worth
the
risk
to
health
and
life
and
what
does
this
policy
say
about
america
