the
national
rifle
association
acted
as
a
foreign
asset
for
russia
in
the
period
leading
up
to
the
election
according
to
a
new
investigation
unveiled
friday
by
sen
ron
wyden
d-ore
drawing
on
contemporaneous
emails
and
private
interviews
an
month
probe
by
the
senate
finance
committee's
democratic
staff
found
that
the
nra
underwrote
political
access
for
russian
nationals
maria
butina
and
alexander
torshin
more
than
previously
known
even
though
the
two
had
declared
their
ties
to
the
kremlin
the
report
available
here
also
describes
how
closely
the
gun
rights
group
was
involved
with
organizing
a
visit
by
some
of
its
leaders
to
moscow
then-nra
vice
president
pete
brownell
who
would
later
become
nra
president
was
enticed
to
visit
russia
with
the
promise
of
personal
business
opportunities
and
the
nra
covered
a
portion
of
the
trip's
costs
the
conclusions
of
the
senate
investigation
could
have
legal
implications
for
the
nra
wyden
says
tax-exempt
organizations
are
barred
from
using
funds
for
the
personal
benefit
of
its
officials
or
for
actions
significantly
outside
their
stated
missions
the
revelations
in
the
senate
report
raise
questions
about
whether
the
nra
could
face
civil
penalties
or
lose
its
tax-exempt
status
the
national
rifle
association
called
the
report
politically
motivated
and
suggested
that
the
moscow
trip
was
not
an
official
nra
trip
an
avalanche
of
proof
confirms
that
the
nra
as
an
organization
was
never
involved
in
the
activities
about
which
the
democrats
write
said
william
a.
brewer
iii
counsel
to
the
nra
continued
brewer
this
report
goes
to
great
lengths
to
try
to
involve
the
nra
in
activities
of
private
individuals
and
create
the
false
impression
that
the
nra
did
not
act
appropriately
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
attorneys
general
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
district
of
columbia
are
conducting
separate
probes
into
alleged
wrongdoing
at
the
gun
rights
organization
these
probes
have
a
broader
scope
than
the
senate
report
which
focuses
on
russia
majority
response
this
is
overblown
the
republican
majority
on
the
senate
finance
committee
which
was
consulted
periodically
throughout
the
democrats
investigation
said
friday
the
report
was
overblown
in
the
republicans
analysis
of
wyden's
report
the
majority
argued
that
it
does
not
account
for
u.s.
russia
relations
at
the
time
and
contains
much
conclusory
innuendo
and
repeatedly
attempts
to
paint
a
picture
that
does
not
exist
the
republicans
also
argued
that
if
the
nra
committed
any
infractions
they
would
be
small
and
do
not
put
the
nra's
tax-exempt
status
at
risk
to
the
extent
nra
funds
were
used
improperly
in
any
facts
discussed
in
the
democratic
report
led
by
wyden
it
appears
to
have
been
minor
hardly
a
rounding
error
for
an
organization
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
revenue
each
year
and
nothing
that
cannot
be
corrected
with
minor
intermediate
sanctions
the
republican
analysis
states
kremlin
links
were
clear
wyden's
page
report
centers
on
butina
a
convicted
russian
agent
now
in
federal
prison
and
torshin
a
former
russian
government
official
who
has
been
sanctioned
by
the
united
states
the
report
indicates
that
top
nra
officials
were
aware
of
butina's
and
torshin's
links
with
the
kremlin
even
as
they
sought
to
work
more
closely
together
under
the
banner
of
gun
rights
in
an
email
later
circulated
to
two
senior
nra
staff
members
butina
wrote
that
a
purpose
of
the
moscow
trip
was
that
many
powerful
figures
in
the
kremlin
are
counting
on
torshin
to
prove
his
american
connections
by
showing
he
could
bring
prominent
nra
officials
to
russia
at
another
point
butina
suggested
to
participants
on
the
nra
trip
to
russia
that
she
might
be
able
to
set
up
a
meeting
between
them
and
president
vladimir
putin
referring
to
him
as
russia's
highest
leader
nra
facilitated
political
access
despite
these
declarations
about
their
ties
to
the
russian
government
nra
officials
paid
for
and
facilitated
torshin
and
butina's
introduction
into
american
political
organizations
butina
and
torshin
received
access
to
republican
party
officials
at
nra
events
it
was
a
explicit
interest
expressed
by
butina
in
one
email
to
an
nra
employee
butina
wrote
is
there
a
list
of
u.s.
governors
or
members
of
congress
that
might
be
present
at
some
time
during
the
nra
annual
meeting
the
employee
responded
with
a
list
the
nra
also
helped
them
forge
connections
with
groups
such
as
the
council
for
national
policy
the
national
prayer
breakfast
the
national
sporting
goods
wholesalers
association
and
safari
club
international
nra
resources
appear
to
have
been
used
to
pay
for
membership
and
registration
fees
to
third
party
events
for
torshin
and
butina
as
well
as
to
arrange
for
transit
to
and
lodging
for
many
of
those
events
throughout
and
the
report
states
report
contradicts
nra
denials
the
senate
report
notes
that
in
then-nra
spokeswoman
dana
loesch
repeatedly
denied
that
the
group
leaders
trip
to
moscow
was
sanctioned
by
the
gun
rights
group
but
in
a
letter
obtained
by
the
committee
then-nra
president
allan
cors
wrote
to
torshin
on
nra
letterhead
after
consulting
with
nra
staff
and
former
nra
president
david
keene
cors
designated
two
nra
figures
to
lead
the
trip
dave
keene
and
top
nra
donor
joe
gregory
will
represent
the
nra
and
our
five
million
members
better
than
anyone
else
he
wrote
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
brownell's
lawyer
also
told
the
committee
that
brownell
believed
the
trip
was
an
official
nra
event
this
view
is
further
strengthened
by
the
committee's
evidence
that
nra
staff
prepared
itineraries
gathered
briefing
materials
applied
for
tourist
visas
paid
for
some
of
the
travel
expenses
and
provided
the
delegation
with
nra
gifts
to
give
to
russian
officials
the
gun
rights
group
said
on
friday
afternoon
that
it
was
not
an
official
nra
trip
certain
nra
members
made
the
trip
of
their
own
accord
the
record
reflects
it
was
not
an
official
nra
trip
said
andrew
arulanandam
the
nra's
managing
director
of
public
affairs
nra
ceo
wayne
lapierre
was
opposed
to
it
and
at
his
directive
no
nra
staff
members
or
employees
attended
the
senate
investigation
found
evidence
that
the
nra
tried
to
hide
various
payments
related
to
the
trip
brownell
covered
approximately
in
expenses
related
to
the
trip
in
june
the
nra
reimbursed
brownell
just
over
after
questions
were
raised
about
the
trip
in
brownell
paid
the
nra
a
transaction
that
brownell's
lawyer
told
the
committee
was
requested
by
the
nra
as
a
way
of
getting
the
trip
off
the
nra's
books
nra
leaders
sought
business
opportunities
the
senate
investigation
concludes
that
a
number
of
nra
figures
on
the
trip
traveled
to
russia
primarily
or
solely
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
personal
business
interests
rather
than
advancing
the
nra's
tax-exempt
purpose
brownell
then
a
vice
president
of
the
nra
is
the
ceo
of
a
major
firearms
supplier
bearing
his
last
name
in
an
email
to
a
staffer
at
his
business
brownell
described
his
trip
as
an
opportunity
to
be
hosted
in
russia
to
broaden
our
business
opportunities
to
introduce
our
company
to
the
governing
individuals
throughout
russia
the
nra
directly
facilitated
brownell's
effort
to
travel
to
moscow
early
to
explore
business
opportunities
with
russian
weapons
manufacturers
the
report
concludes
another
member
of
the
trip
nra
donor
and
then-outdoor
channel
ceo
jim
liberatore
told
the
senate
committee
through
his
lawyer
that
his
participation
in
the
moscow
trip
was
purely
commercial
wyden
seeks
irs
probe
wyden
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
finance
committee
said
at
the
conclusion
of
his
investigation
that
his
staff
had
revealed
information
that
shows
that
the
national
rifle
association
may
have
abused
its
tax-exempt
status
the
next
step
he
says
is
for
the
irs
to
launch
its
own
inquiry
the
totality
of
evidence
uncovered
during
my
investigation
as
well
as
the
mounting
evidence
of
rampant
self-dealing
indicate
the
nra
may
have
violated
tax
laws
wyden
said
the
irs
needs
to
examine
these
findings
and
investigate
other
publicly
reported
incidents
of
potential
lawbreaking
