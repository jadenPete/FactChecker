congress
is
poised
to
restrict
purchases
of
chinese-built
buses
and
rail
cars
in
legislation
that
could
open
a
new
front
in
the
trade
war
alongside
the
trump
administration's
squabbles
with
beijing
a
bill
would
forbid
the
use
of
federal
grants
which
the
department
of
transportation
often
makes
to
big-city
transit
authorities
to
buy
new
subway
trains
or
buses
from
the
chinese-owned
manufacturer
crrc
robert
puentes
president
of
the
eno
center
for
transportation
a
nonpartisan
transportation
think
tank
says
crrc
already
dominates
the
market
for
rail
cars
in
china
and
they
intend
to
corner
the
global
market
here
in
united
states
puentes
says
the
company
has
successfully
won
bids
for
transit
agencies
in
boston
chicago
los
angeles
and
philadelphia
by
adhering
to
the
rules
that
these
agencies
and
these
cities
have
laid
out
crrc
has
built
two
american
plants
one
in
massachusetts
and
one
in
illinois
where
it
assembles
the
rail
cars
the
shells
are
imported
from
china
other
parts
are
made
in
the
united
states
puentes
says
there
are
no
american-owned
companies
that
make
these
kinds
of
commuter
rail
cars
although
there
are
u.s.
firms
that
make
freight
cars
other
transit
systems
rely
on
other
foreign-based
manufacturers
washington
d.c.
s
rail
transit
authority
for
example
is
buying
cars
assembled
in
the
united
states
by
a
division
of
the
japanese
manufacturer
kawasaki
rep
harley
rouda
d-calif
is
chief
sponsor
of
legislation
that
would
ban
the
transit
systems
from
using
federal
money
to
buy
the
chinese
rail
cars
he
tells
npr
the
u.s.
should
not
be
supporting
a
company
subsidized
by
the
chinese
government
we
think
it's
important
that
american
taxpayers
hard-earned
dollars
and
the
money
that
they
have
provided
to
the
federal
government
not
go
to
support
chinese
companies
bent
on
undermining
industries
that
are
important
to
our
national
security
rouda
says
the
legislation
would
not
affect
existing
contracts
between
u.s.
transit
agencies
and
crcc
and
he
says
that
aside
from
the
economic
implications
there
are
important
national
security
concerns
just
think
for
a
minute
that
if
you
ever
ended
up
in
hostilities
with
a
country
that
controlled
those
railways
and
those
bus
systems
what
the
economic
impact
in
the
national
security
threat
it
would
cause
to
a
country
such
as
the
united
states

nothing
sinister
here
not
so
says
lydia
rivera
a
spokeswoman
for
crrc's
massachusetts-based
division
those
are
exaggerated
statements
she
says
worries
that
china
might
use
the
rail
cars
it
builds
to
spy
on
americans
or
hack
their
data
are
unfounded
concerns
unfortunately
by
lobbyists
none
of
the
so-called
at-risk
systems
on
our
rail
cars
pose
a
threat
backers
of
the
ban
include
u.s.
freight
car
manufacturers
who
worry
the
chinese
will
target
their
business
next
rivera
says
that's
not
going
to
happen
we
have
no
interest
in
the
freight
industry
it
is
not
lucrative
for
us
and
we
will
not
be
going
to
the
freight
industry
rivera
says
a
ban
on
the
use
of
federal
funds
could
mean
the
loss
of
jobs
at
the
massachusetts
factory
puentes
of
the
eno
center
believes
the
national
security
concerns
over
the
chinese-built
rail
cars
are
a
bit
overstated
there
is
a
long
and
steady
supply
chain
he
says
there's
a
long
long
and
lengthy
review
process
there
is
oversight
by
the
transit
agencies
so
some
of
that
i
think
is
being
overblown
when
it
comes
to
national
security
but
the
economic
security
concerns
are
something
we
do
have
to
deal
with
puentes
called
the
proposed
ban
part
of
the
larger
set
of
policy
concerns
between
the
u.s.
and
china
which
include
the
trade
war
along
with
cybersecurity
and
economic
security
issues
we
have
to
understand
that
it
really
is
highly
nuanced
and
it's
not
as
simple
i
think
as
some
are
making
it
out
to
be
the
provision
banning
use
of
federal
funds
on
chinese
rail
cars
is
part
of
the
house
defense
authorization
bill
a
similar
provision
also
including
a
ban
on
spending
on
chinese
bus
manufacturers
is
part
of
the
senate-passed
measure
rouda
says
he
thinks
the
differences
between
the
two
chambers
legislation
should
be
resolved
quickly
