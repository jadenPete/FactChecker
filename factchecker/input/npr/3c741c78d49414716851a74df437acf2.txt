his
national
political
shadow
looms
large
he
spent
years
in

before
retiring
his
position
of
senate
minority
leader
in
he
built
a
machine
for

that
ultimately
delivered

state
to
hillary
clinton

the
democrats
in

he
had

reputation
for
being

tough
politician
who
did
what
was
necessary
to
get
what
he
thought
needed

done

if
sometimes
that

had
to
quit
doing

with
his

he
spends
a
lot
of
time
reading
but
even
in
retirement
he's
still
involved
in
politics
sharing
ideas
he
says
to
colleagues
in
washington
and
speaking
to
front-runners
in
the
democratic
primary
in
a
wide-ranging
conversation
reid
spoke
with
npr
about
taking
president
trump's
potential
reelection
seriously
the
urgency
of
climate
change
and
getting
rid
of
the
filibuster
entirely
the
senate
threshold
of
senators
to
advance
a
bill
you
want
to
get
rid
of
the
filibuster
entirely
in
the
senate
does
this
set
a
dangerous
precedent
if
you
look
at
where
the
filibuster
came
from
we
didn't
have
one
until
and
it
was
developed
to
cut
off
debate
because
it
could
go
on
forever
what
has
happened
now
is
the
filibuster
has
been
used
as
a
weapon
to
just
have
the
senate
do
nothing
it
used
to
be
that
the
senate
worked
quite
well
the
filibuster
was
there
but
it
was
used
on
a
basis
of
collegiality
it
wasn't
used
very
often
when
something
was
extremely
important
to
a
member
they
would
exercise
their
rights
but
it
didn't
bring
the
senate
to
a
standstill
forever
right
now
the
vote
threshold
is
what
everything
is
now
everything
is
votes
everything
in
you
got
rid
of
the
filibuster
for
most
executive
appointees
in
a
gridlocked
congress
that
was
holding
up
judicial
and
other
executive
appointees
under
the
obama
administration
it
was
seen
as
the
nuclear
option
republican
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
then
took
it
further
and
got
rid
of
the
filibuster
for
supreme
court
nominees
in
so
i
moved
to
change
the
rules
as
a
result
of
that
obama
got
his
hundred-plus
judges
and
his
cabinet
spots
filled
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
now
that
wasn't
the
first
time
the
rules
have
been
changed
they've
changed
lots
of
times
in
the
past
but
i
think
that
now
with
the
senate
being
basically
inoperable
because
republicans
in
congress
after
congress
have
just
refused
to
get
anything
done
people
are
not
able
to
offer
amendments
it's
just
not
good
for
the
country
i
think
we
need
to
take
a
very
close
look
at
getting
rid
of
the
filibuster
period
doesn't
that
create
a
situation
where
one
party
gets
to
railroad
the
other
party
depending
on
who
is
in
charge
of
that
upper
chamber
but
at
least
it
would
be
done
with
the
majority
the
way
it
is
now
one
party
railroads
the
other
one
you
get
nothing
done
at
least
that
way
you
can
get
something
done
great
if
you're
in
majority
it's
not
so
good
if
you're
a
minority
but
the
way
it
is
now
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
in
the
majority
or
minority
you
don't
get
anything
done
it's
important
because
let's
take
some
major
issues
the
country
faces
no
issue
in
my
mind
is
more
important
than
climate
change
it
is
devastating
our
world
the
united
states
must
be
a
leader
in
this
but
with
trump
and
basically
republicans
saying
that
climate
change
doesn't
exist
we're
getting
nothing
done
i
mean
nothing
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
spare
take
something
like
guns
now
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
feel
about
the
second
amendment
the
fact
is
percent
of
the
american
people
believe
there
should
be
background
checks
for
people
that
are
crazy
or
criminals
but
we
can't
get
it
done
in
the
senate
the
filibuster
should
go
so
we
can
get
something
done
on
guns
how
difficult
do
you
think
this
race
against
president
trump
is
going
to
be
i
think
that
anyone
who
thinks
it's
going
to
be
a
walk
in
the
park
are
wrong
no
one
should
discount
donald
trump
he's
spent
a
lifetime
developing
who
he
is
and
i
wish
he
were
somebody
else
but
he's
somebody
that
has
been
able
to
focus
on
race
he
focuses
on
the
environment
but
the
wrong
way
he
focuses
on
the
economy
i
think
in
the
wrong
way
these
tariffs
are
not
only
hurting
america
they're
hurting
the
world
so
i
think
that
his
simplistic
views
on
the
world
translate
to
people
not
wanting
to
focus
real
hard
on
what
needs
to
be
done
to
help
this
country
so
don't
discount
him
he's
going
to
be
hard
to
beat
on
his
former
republican
colleagues
i'm
really
frankly
disappointed
in
some
of
them
names
which
i
won't
mention
who've
become
such
lapdogs
for
president
trump
that's
so
unlike
what
i
thought
they
would
be
i
really
strongly
believe
an
admonition
i
got
when
i
first
came
to
the
senate
from
sen
robert
byrd
who
said
always
remember
we
do
not
work
for
the
president
we
work
with
the
president
i
think
some
of
my
colleagues
have
forgotten
that
they
work
with
the
president
they're
working
for
him
on
whether
he
misses
capitol
hill
no
i
believe
in
the
old
testament
admonition
that
there's
a
time
for
everything
a
time
for
planting
a
time
for
reaping
i
just
think
that
that
was
my
time
i
enjoyed
every
minute
of
my
years
in
the
senate
and
my
four
years
in
the
house
but
that
was
my
time
and
now
is
not
my
time
you
had
such
a
long
storied
political
career
when
you
look
back
is
there
anything
that
you
regret
oh
sure
i
sure
do
the
biggest
regret
i
have
is
having
voted
for
the
iraq
war
i
was
misled
but
i
learned
quickly
that
i
made
a
bad
decision
so
i
spent
a
lot
of
my
career
after
a
couple
weeks
criticizing
the
war
the
worst
foreign
policy
mistake
this
country
ever
made
it's
destabilized
the
middle
east
we
may
have
had
some
autocratic
governments
there
but
at
least
they
were
stable
we
destabilized
the
whole
area
leading
to
the
deaths
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
the
migration
of
millions
of
people
the
rest
of
the
stuff
i've
kind
of
come
to
the
conclusion
a
long
time
ago
that
there's
no
need
to
rehash
what
i
did
i
did
it
when
you
look
at
the
future
of
this
nation
what
worries
you
the
most
well
i
have
a
number
of
concerns
i
have
to
be
concerned
about
climate
change
we're
here
in
the
deserts
of
nevada
as
we
speak
but
we
have
storms
here
we
never
had
before
we
have
wildfires
we
never
had
before
and
they're
coming
more
often
the
fire
season
is
now
days
longer
than
it
was
just
years
ago
so
climate
change
for
nevada
our
country
and
the
rest
of
world
is
something
we
have
to
dial
up
it's
really
really
important
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
deal
with
it
before
it's
too
late
i
believe
that
this
may
sound
unusual
coming
from
me
having
served
in
congress
for
years
but
i'll
tell
you
right
now
i
think
the
debt
this
country
is
incurring
is
very
very
unhealthy
we
should
start
talking
about
that
where
are
my
republican
colleagues
when
i
went
to
congress
and
for
many
years
thereafter
that's
what
they
talked
about
the
debt
i
never
hear
a
peep
out
of
them
now
trump
is
running
this
country
into
such
grossly
unfair
debt
that
it's
going
to
be
generations
to
get
out
of
that
i
think
that
the
immigration
situation
is
something
that
we
cannot
ignore
we've
got
to
do
something
about
it
and
we've
just
passed
the
buck
for
far
too
long
building
a
wall
is
not
going
to
make
it
any
better
