recent
statements
by
census
bureau
and
justice
department
officials
have
raised
the
question
of
whether
the
trump
administration
plans
to
diverge
from
more
than
two
centuries
of
precedent
in
how
the
country's
congressional
seats
and
electoral
college
votes
are
divvied
up
since
the
first
u.s.
census
in
the
constitution
has
called
for
a
head
count
every
years
of
persons
living
in
the
u.s.
to
determine
the
number
of
congressional
seats
each
state
gets
federal
law
requires
the
commerce
secretary
who
oversees
the
census
bureau
to
deliver
those
numbers
by
the
end
of
a
census
year
to
the
president
who
must
report
them
to
congress
within
a
week
after
the
start
of
its
new
session
the
counts
have
always
included
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
regardless
of
immigration
status
although
the
history
of
who
was
counted
and
how
is
complicated
following
the
civil
war
the
th
amendment
was
ratified
to
require
the
counting
of
the
whole
number
of
persons
ensuring
the
rights
of
formerly
enslaved
people
who
were
once
considered
three
fifths
of
a

the
indians
not

clause
no
longer
excluded
some
american
indians
by
the
census
when
the
census
bureau
began
attempting
to
include
all
native
americans
in
the
counts
used
for
reapportioning
seats
in
congress
in
recent
weeks
however
the
census
bureau's
director
steven
dillingham
has
not
been
able
to
provide
a
clear
answer
as
to
whether
citizenship
will
be
factored
into
apportionment
after
the
census
during
a
house
oversight
subcommittee
hearing
last
month
rep
ayanna
pressley
a
democrat
from
massachusetts
pressed
dillingham
about
president
trump's
recent
executive
order
can
you
confirm
for
us
today
that
the
citizenship
data
collected
pursuant
to
the
executive
order
will
not
be
used
in
the
bureau's
apportionment
counts
pressley
asked
after
a
notable
three-second
pause
dillingham
stumbled
into
an
attempt
to
defer
a
response
before
pressley
asked
whether
the
head
of
the
census
bureau
believes
that
the
citizenship
data
should
be
used
for
apportionment
i
don't
have
any
belief
whatsoever
i
just
need
to
know
the
mechanics
congresswoman
replied
dillingham
who
later
agreed
to
provide
a
written
response
within
days
on
aug
six
days
after
that
deadline
the
bureau
provided
this
reply
to
pressley's
office
that
litigation
is
a
lawsuit
filed
against
the
trump
administration
last
year
by
the
state
of
alabama
and
rep
mo
brooks
a
republican
from
that
state
alabama
state
attorney
general
steve
marshall
and
brooks
argue
that
the
census
bureau
should
exclude
unauthorized
immigrants
from
numbers
used
for
apportionment
because
the
framers
did
not
intend
for
immigrants
living
in
the
u.s.
without
authorization
to
be
included
among
the
persons
described
in
the
constitution
the
census
bureau
has
not
directly
responded
to
npr's
question
about
whether
the
bureau
plans
to
include
citizens
unauthorized
immigrants
and
other
noncitizens
in
the
apportionment
count
the
bureau's
public
information
office
has
also
not
responded
to
questions
about
why
dillingham
missed
the
initial
deadline
for
providing
a
response
to
pressley
former
census
bureau
director
john
thompson
tells
npr
the
ambiguity
in
the
bureau's
statement
to
pressley
about
the
apportionment
count
raises
some
serious
concerns
i
don't
think
it's
normal
for
the
census
bureau
to
be
vague
about
what
goes
into
its
most
important
product
says
thompson
who
was
appointed
by
president
barack
obama
and
left
the
bureau
in
with
just
over
five
months
until
the
official
start
of
the
census
thompson
says
it's
incredibly
important
for
the
bureau
to
be
transparent
about
what
data
will
be
used
to
decide
how
congressional
seats
and
electoral
college
votes
are
redistributed
i
would
urge
the
congress
to
probe
and
find
out
why
the
census
bureau
is
not
being
allowed
to
simply
state
the
government
position
in
that
lawsuit
thompson
adds
i
think
that
the
census
bureau
is
not
being
allowed
to
state
the
government's
position
and
that
raises
the
specter
that
something
is
going
on
behind
the
scenes
efforts
to
exclude
unauthorized
immigrants
from
the
apportionment
count
through
lawsuits
go
back
to
the
s
led
by
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
an
immigration
restrictionist
group
the
cases
were
ultimately
dismissed
most
recently
however
the
idea
was
resurrected
by
kris
kobach
the
former
kansas
secretary
of
state
who
discussed
the
addition
of
a
citizenship
question
with
officials
during
trump's
election
campaign
in
an
email
to
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
who
oversees
the
census
bureau
kobach
suggested
wording
for
a
question
that
would
ask
noncitizens
about
their
immigration
status
noting
the
problem
that
aliens
who
do
not
actually
reside
in
the
united
states
are
still
counted
for
congressional
reapportionment
purposes
while
justice
department
attorneys
representing
the
administration
in
the
case
have
asked
for
the
alabama
lawsuit
to
be
dismissed
u.s.
district
judge
r.
david
proctor
in
birmingham
ala
has
called
the
doj's
efforts
rather
halfhearted
late
last
year
proctor
allowed
groups
represented
by
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
under
law
and
other
legal
organizations
to
intervene
in
the
lawsuit
in
an
opinion
last
year
he
wrote
that
allowing
the
groups
to
participate
in
the
case
will
increase
the
prospect
that
the
court
will
be
more
fully
informed
of
the
best
arguments
that
support
the
census
bureau's
position
on
monday
new
york
state
attorney

letitia
james
office
led
a
coalition
of
more
than
two
dozen
states
counties
and
cities
as
well
as
the
u.s.
conference
of
mayors
in
asking
proctor
to
allow
them
to
also
defend
the
bureau
in
the
lawsuit
arguing
that
they
could
lose
congressional
seats
and
electoral
college
votes
as
well
as
federal
funding
if
unauthorized
immigrants
living
in
the
u.s.
are
no
longer
considered
residents
for
the
purposes
of
the
census
no
individual
ceases
to
be
a
person
because
they
lack
documentation
james
said
in
a
written
statement
after
the
court
filings
were
released
the
city
of
atlanta
and
virginia's
arlington
county
filed
a
similar
request
on
monday
proctor
had
previously
scheduled
a
hearing
for
sept
to
determine
the
next
steps
in
the
case
in
their
request
to
proctor
attorneys
for
the
coalition
cited
remarks
by
u.s.
attorney
general
william
barr
in
the
white
house
rose
garden
last
month
when
trump
announced
his
administration
was
backing
down
from
its
failed
attempt
to
add
a
citizenship
question
that
three
federal
courts
have
now
permanently
blocked
from
appearing
on
census
forms
as
an
alternative
trump
announced
he
was
issuing
an
executive
order
which
essentially
repackages
ongoing
census
bureau
efforts
ordered
by
the
administration
last
year
to
produce
citizenship
data
based
on
the
records
of
other
federal
agencies
the
order
also
notes
that
citizenship
data
could
help
the
government
generate
a
more
reliable
count
of
the
unauthorized
alien
population
in
the
country
during
the
announcement
barr
noted
that
the
data
will
be
used
for
countless
purposes
and
referenced
alabama's
lawsuit
still
more
than
a
week
later
justice
department
attorneys
made
a
court
filing
asking
for
alabama's
lawsuit
to
be
tossed
out
the
justice
department
declined
to
elaborate
on
barr's
remarks
or
comment
on
whether
it
intends
to
continue
defending
the
census
bureau
in
the
alabama
lawsuit
according
to
an
email
from
doj
spokesperson
kelly
laco
the
white
house
has
not
responded
to
npr's
request
for
comment
the
alabama
case
however
has
apparently
stopped
census
officials
from
talking
about
the
bureau's
long-standing
interpretation
of
its
constitutional
mandate
in
fact
on
a
frequently
asked
questions
page
on
its
official
website
the
bureau
explains
the
apportionment
calculation
is
based
upon
the
total
resident
population
citizens
and
non-citizens
of
the
states
robert
groves
who
was
appointed
by
obama
to
serve
as
the
census
bureau's
director
during
the
census
sees
the
bureau's
refusal
to
comment
because
of
ongoing
litigation
as
a
pretty
common
response
for
all
institutions
but
groves
says
he
doesn't
see
any
wiggle
room
in
reinterpreting
the
constitutional
mandate
to
include
only
citizens
for
divvying
up
congressional
seats
it's
a
clear
line
of
statute
and
constitutional
amendments
that
make
the
resident
population
the
count
that
drives
the
reapportionment
process
says
groves
who
now
serves
as
the
provost
of
georgetown
university
a
former
census
bureau
director
appointed
by
both
republican
and
democratic
presidents
agrees
with
groves
vincent
barabba
who
led
the
bureau
for
two
terms
and
served
under
presidents
richard
nixon
gerald
ford
and
jimmy
carter
said
in
an
email
that
he
feels
confident
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
founders
of
our
county
to
use
the
complete
count
to
apportion
the
house
of
representatives
unless
congress
begins
the
process
of
amending
the
constitution
to
change
the
process
that
has
been
continually
used
barabba
added
i
would
continue
to
use
the
existing
process
last
month
however
trump
appeared
to
signal
a
potential
change
after
the
count
when
a
reporter
asked
the
reason
for
trying
to
get
a
citizenship
question
on
the
census
no
the
president
said
before
boarding
the
marine
one
helicopter
from
the
white
house
lawn
you
need
it
for
congress
