president
trump
told
ukraine's
president
that
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
the
activities
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
family
in
ukraine
and
asked
its
leader
to
be
in
touch
with
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
and
attorney
general
bill
barr
that's
according
to
a
briefing
for
correspondents
about
the
contents
of
the
july
phone
call
on
wednesday
at
the
justice
department
read
the
partial
white
house
transcript
about
the
conversation
here
the
conversation
raised
concerns
by
a
whistleblower
that
trump
may
have
broken
the
law
by
asking
for
foreign
help
in
the
presidential
campaign
but
the
justice
department
concluded
that
based
on
the
evidence
that's
available
prosecutors
did
not
and
could
not
make
out
a
criminal
campaign
finance
violation
under
the
law
a
thing
of
value
under
discussion
has
to
be
in
some
way
quantifiable
and
the
justice
department
couldn't
find
that
here
officials
said
even
so
the
official
account
of
the
phone
conversation
confirms
the
kernel
of
the
story
that
has
brought
washington
to
a
fever
pitch
over
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
the
american
president
asked
the
ukrainian
president
for
help
with
political
ammunition
against
his
potential
election
rival
i
would
like
you
to
do
us
a
favor
trump
asked
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
according
to
the
official
account
released
on
wednesday
later
in
the
conversation
according
to
the
memo
trump
said
i
would
like
you
to
find
out
what
happened
with
this
whole
situation
in
ukraine
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
that
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
prosecution
so
if
you
can
look
into
it
it
sounds
horrible
to
me
zelenskiy
told
trump
that
he
would
appoint
the
next
top
prosecutor
who
might
be
responsible
for
prosecuting
corruption
and
that
he
or
she
will
look
into
the
situation
specifically
to
the
company
that
you
mentioned
in
this
issue
trump
then
told
the
ukrainian
president
that
he
would
have
giuliani
and
barr
make
contact
with
him
and
that
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i'm
sure
you
will
figure
it
out
trump
on
his
visit
to
the
united
nations
on
wednesday
scoffed
that
the
ukraine
affair
is
a
witch
hunt
and
that
democrats
are
worried
about
being
defeated
in
the
election
trump
pointed
to
what
he
called
the
successes
of
his
first
term
saying
we've
got
the
strongest
economy
we've
ever
had
flow
of
assistance
was
cut
off
the
president's
july
conversation
followed
moves
by
the
white
house
to
stanch
the
flow
of
military
assistance
for
ukraine
that
washington
had
been
providing
since
the
armed
incursion
by
russian
forces
in
zelenskiy
raised
the
military
assistance
in
the
call
with
trump
according
to
the
white
house
account
he
thanked
the
american
president
and
said
specifically
we
are
almost
ready
to
buy
more
javelins
from
the
united
states
for
defense
purposes
that's
a
reference
to
the
american
guided
anti-tank
missile
javelin
built
by
raytheon
and
lockheed
martin
the
u.s.
began
delivering
them
to
ukraine's
military
in
trump
responded
to
zelenskiy
with
his
request
for
a
favor
mentioning
the
cybersecurity
firm
crowdstrike
and
a
server
likely
an
allusion
to
the
cyberattack
against
the
democratic
national
committee
in
the
president
also
alluded
to
the
testimony
of
former
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
who
had
appeared
in
congress
the
day
before
zelenskiy
and
other
ukrainian
officials
were
blindsided
by
the
interruption
in
american
assistance
according
to
the
new
york
times
other
agencies
in
washington
were
not
briefed
about
any
reason
for
the
pause
in
the
assistance
nor
was
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
after
the
matter
came
to
the
attention
of
more
members
of
congress
the
assistance
was
restored
earlier
this
month
worries
inside
the
spy
world
the
whistleblower
within
the
intelligence
community
brought
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
its
official
watchdog
raising
the
prospect
that
trump's
conversation
might
have
violated
u.s.
law
the
inspector
general
concluded
that
it
rose
to
the
level
of
an
urgent
concern
because
the
intelligence
community
is
responsible
for
safeguarding
elections
then
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
justice
department
officials
said
which
reached
its
conclusion
about
the
paucity
of
evidence
that
a
campaign
finance
law
had
been
broken
justice
department
officials
also
say
barr
the
attorney
general
learned
about
the
conversation
several
weeks
after
it
took
place
but
has
not
spoken
about
it
with
trump
and
was
never
asked
by
trump
to
contact
anyone
in
ukraine
the
doj
officials
said
barr
has
not
spoken
about
the
ukraine
affair
with
giuliani
either
giuliani
meanwhile
has
acknowledged
that
he
has
been
closely
involved
with
talks
with
ukrainians
about
launching
or
reviving
some
kind
of
investigation
into
hunter
biden's
time
doing
in
business
in
ukraine
former
vice
president
biden
said
tuesday
that
neither
he
nor
his
son
have
done
anything
wrong
and
he
decried
what
he
called
the
smears
and
conspiracy
theories
that
were
being
propounded
by
the
white
house
trump
is
guilty
of
abusing
his
office
biden
said
and
if
he
continues
what
biden
called
his
stonewalling
of
congress
the
former
vice
president
said
he'd
support
impeachment
it
is
a
tragedy
for
this
country
that
our
president
put
personal
politics
above
his
sacred
oath
biden
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
this
is
not
a
republican
issue
or
a
democratic
issue
it
is
a
national
security
issue
it
is
a
test
of
our
democratic
values
congress
must
pursue
the
facts
and
quickly
take
prompt
action
to
hold
donald
trump
accountable
house
democrats
say
they've
agreed
to
initiate
a
new
phase
of
their
impeachment
inquiry
although
it
isn't
clear
how
soon
that
might
result
in
new
action
in
the
congress
or
against
trump
backstory
the
dispute
over
the
whistleblower's
complaint
began
when
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
learned
that
it
had
been
filed
but
not
what
it
contained
schiff
and
other
members
of
congress
argued
the
administration
had
no
right
under
the
law
to
withhold
the
matter
from
the
committees
of
oversight
notwithstanding
the
intelligence
community
watchdog's
conclusion
that
the
complaint
was
an
urgent
concern
the
justice
department
opined
that
the
complaint
didn't
arise
in
connection
with
intelligence
activity
doj
officials
said
on
wednesday
that
is
the
standard
under
the
law
that
governs
the
relationship
with
congress
the
officials
said
and
that
is
why
the
justice
department
took
the
position
that
the
administration
did
not
have
to
give
the
document
to
lawmakers
schiff's
complaints
about
the
administration's
positions
started
a
snowball
that
resulted
in
growing
attention
to
the
whistleblower
case
and
then
press
reports
that
helped
shape
public
understanding
about
the
ukraine
affair
the
temperature
rose
in
washington
to
such
a
point
that
trump
who
says
that
he
has
not
done
anything
wrong
and
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
in
his
discussion
with
zelenskiy
felt
obliged
to
release
the
official
white
house
records
about
his
call
what
still
isn't
clear
is
whether
the
whistleblower
complaint
itself
might
become
public
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
were
expected
to
be
able
to
review
it
on
wednesday
afternoon
and
then
get
copies
of
their
own
on
thursday
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
is
scheduled
to
appear
before
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
committees
on
thursday
the
morning
session
before
the
house
permanent
select
committee
on
intelligence
is
expected
to
be
open
the
afternoon
session
before
the
senate
select
committee
on
intelligence
is
expected
to
be
closed
complaint
called
partisan
trump
and
white
house
officials
have
said
they
don't
know
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
but
the
president
nonetheless
dismissed
the
person's
actions
as
partisan
and
officials
at
the
justice
department
on
wednesday
affirmed
that
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
found
some
indicia
of
an
arguable
political
bias
on
the
part
of
the
complainant
in
favor
of
a
rival
political
candidate
at
the
same
time
the
ig
concluded
that
the
complaint's
allegations
nonetheless
appeared
credible
trump's
allies
including
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
have
argued
that
the
partisan
nature
of
the
complaint
must
be
taken
into
account
in
understanding
the
full
story
this
is
the
result
of
someone
who
wasn't
personally
involved
with
trump's
call
getting
a
secondhand
briefing
about
it
and
then
trying
to
help
democrats
graham
and
others
argue
