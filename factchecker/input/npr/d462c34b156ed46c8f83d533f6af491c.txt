he
was
joseph

the
former
u.s.

who
publicly
challenged
the
reasoning
behind
president
george
w.
bush's
invasion
of
iraq
died
friday
he
was
wilson
died
of
organ
failure
his
ex-wife
valerie
plame
confirmed
to
several
news
outlets
plame's
identity
as
a
cia
operative
was
revealed
a
week
after
wilson
contested
the
bush
administration
in
a
new
york
times
op-ed
plame
and
wilson
divorced
in
the
dispute
between
wilson
and
the
bush
administration
began
after
president
bush
declared
in
his
state
of
the
union
speech
in
january
that
iraq
was
attempting
to
restart
its
nuclear
program
the
british
government
has
learned
that
saddam
hussein
recently
sought
significant
quantities
of
uranium
from
africa
bush
said
the
u.s.
invaded
iraq
seven
weeks
later
but
in
an
op-ed
titled
what
i
didn't
find
in
africa
published
in
the
new
york
times
wilson
directly
contradicted
those
words
he
claimed
that
the
bush
administration
was
manipulating
intelligence
to
justify
the
iraq
invasion
based
on
my
experience
with
the
administration
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
war
i
have
little
choice
but
to
conclude
that
some
of
the
intelligence
related
to
iraq's
nuclear
weapons
program
was
twisted
to
exaggerate
the
iraqi
threat
wilson
wrote
for
years
wilson
served
as
a
foreign
diplomat
in
various
locations
he
was
the
senior
u.s.
diplomat
in
baghdad
during
the
first
gulf
war
in
as
a
private
citizen
he
was
asked
by
the
cia
to
travel
to
niger
on
behalf
of
the
u.s.
government
to
investigate
claims
that
niger
had
sold
uranium
to
iraq
in
the
s
according
to
his
op-ed
i
spent
the
next
eight
days
drinking
sweet
mint
tea
and
meeting
with
dozens
of
people
current
government
officials
former
government
officials
people
associated
with
the
country's
uranium
business
wilson
wrote
it
did
not
take
long
to
conclude
that
it
was
highly
doubtful
that
any
such
transaction
had
ever
taken
place
that
op-ed
set
off
a
firestorm
in
washington
d.c.
as
the
bush
administration
scrambled
to
justify
bush's
state
of
the
union
claim
a
week
after
the
article
was
published
wilson's
then-wife
valerie
plame's
covert
identity
as
a
cia
operative
was
leaked
to
the
press
and
then
exposed
by
columnist
robert
novak
plame
had
been
undercover
for
most
of
her
career
it
just
felt
like
i
got
a
sucker
punch
to
the
gut
plame
told
npr's
fresh
air
in
and
i
knew
of
course
my
career
as
i
knew
it
was
over
she
was
forced
to
resign
from
the
cia
i
was
not
surprised
that
the
white
house
would
attempt
to
discredit
me
there
is
a
long
practice
in
this
town
of
trying
to
destroy
the
credibility
of
the
message
by
destroying
the
credibility
of
the
messenger
wilson
told
npr's
renee
montagne
in
i
was
shocked
that
somebody
in
the
u.s.
government
would
take
a
decision
that
the
political
agenda
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
or
defend
was
more
important
than
the
national
security
of
the
country

wilson
never
regretted
writing
the
op-ed
that
catapulted
them
both
into
the
national
spotlight
he
did
it
because
