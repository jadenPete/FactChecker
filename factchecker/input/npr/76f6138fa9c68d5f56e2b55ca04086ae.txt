the
president
congratulations
on
a
great
victory
we
all
watched
from
the
united
states
and
you
did
a
terrific
job
the
way
you
came
from
behind
somebody
who
wasn't
given
much
of
a
chance
and
you
ended
up
winning
easily
it's
a
fantastic
achievement
congratulations
president
zelenskyy
you
are
absolutely
right
mr
president
we
did
win
big
and
we
worked
hard
for
this
we
worked
a
lot
but
i
would
like
to
confess
to
you
that
i
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
from
you
we
used
quite
a
few
of
your
skills
and
knowledge
and
were
able
to
use
it
as
an
example
for
our
elections
and
yes
it
is
true
that
these
were
unique
elections
we
were
in
a
unique
situation
that
we
were
able
to
achieve
a
unique
success
i'm
able
to
tell
you
the
following
the
first
time
you
called
me
to
congratulate
me
when
i
won
my
presidential
election
and
the
second
time
you
are
now
calling
me
when
my
party
won
the
parliamentary
election
i
think
i
should
run
more
often
so
you
can
call
me
more
often
and
we
can
talk
over
the
phone
more
often
the
president
laughter
that's
a
very
good
idea
i
think
your
country
is
very
happy
about
that
president
zelenskyy
well
yes
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
are
trying
to
work
hard
because
we
wanted
to
drain
the
swamp
here
in
our
country
we
brought
in
many
many
new
people
not
the
old
politicians
not
the
typical
politicians
because
we
want
to
have
a
new
format
and
a
new
type
of
government
you
are
a
great
teacher
for
us
and
in
that
the
president
well
it's
very
nice
of
you
to
say
that
i
will
say
that
we
do
a
lot
for
ukraine
we
spend
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
time
much
more
than
the
european
countries
are
doing
and
they
should
be
helping
you
more
than
they
are
germany
does
almost
nothing
for
you
all
they
do
is
talk
and
i
think
it's
something
that
you
should
really
ask
them
about
when
i
was
speaking
to
angela
merkel
she
talks
ukraine
but
she
doesn't
do
anything
a
lot
of
the
european
countries
are
the
same
way
so
i
think
it's
something
you
want
to
look
at
but
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
reciprocal
necessarily
because
things
are
happening
that
are
not
good
but
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
president
zelenskyy
yes
you
are
absolutely
right
not
only
but
actually
and
i
can
tell
you
the
following
i
did
talk
to
angela
merkel
and
i
did
meet
with
her
i
also
met
and
talked
with
macron
and
i
told
them
that
they
are
not
doing
quite
as
much
as
they
need
to
be
doing
on
the
issues
with
the
sanctions
they
are
not
enforcing
the
sanctions
they
are
not
working
as
much
as
they
should
work
for
ukraine
it
turns
out
that
even
though
logically
the
european
union
should
be
our
biggest
partner
but
technically
the
united
states
is
a
much
bigger
partner
than
the
european
union
and
i'm
very
grateful
to
you
for
that
because
the
united
states
is
doing
quite
a
lot
for
ukraine
much
more
than
the
european
union
especially
when
we
are
talking
about
sanctions
against
the
russian
federation
i
would
also
like
to
thank
you
for
your
great
support
in
the
area
of
defense
we
are
ready
to
continue
to
cooperate
for
the
next
steps
specifically
we
are
almost
ready
to
buy
more
javelins
from
the
united
states
for
defense
purposes
the
president
i
would
like
you
to
do
us
a
favor
though
because
our
country
has
been
through
a
lot
and
ukraine
knows
a
lot
about
it
i
would
like
you
to
find
out
what
happened
with
this
whole
situation
with
ukraine
they
say
crowdstrike
i
guess
you
have
one
of
your
wealthy
people
the
server
they
say
ukraine
has
it
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
went
on
the
whole
situation
i
think
you're
surrounding
yourself
with
some
of
the
same
people
i
would
like
to
have
the
attorney
general
call
you
or
your
people
and
i
would
like
you
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
as
you
saw
yesterday
that
whole
nonsense
ended
with
a
very
poor
performance
by
a
man
named
robert
mueller
an
incompetent
performance
but
they
say
a
lot
of
it
started
with
ukraine
whatever
you
can
do
it's
very
important
that
you
do
it
if
that's
possible
president
zelenskyy
yes
it
is
very
important
for
me
and
everything
that
you
just
mentioned
earlier
for
me
as
a
president
is
very
important
and
we
are
open
for
any
future
cooperation
we
are
ready
to
open
a
new
page
on
cooperation
in
relations
between
the
united
states
and
ukraine
for
that
purpose
i
just
recalled
our
ambassador
from
united
states
and
he
will
be
replaced
by
a
very
competent
and
very
experienced
ambassador
who
will
work
hard
on
making
sure
that
our
two
nations
are
getting
closer
i
would
also
like
and
hope
to
see
him
having
your
trust
and
your
confidence
and
have
personal
relations
with
you
so
we
can
cooperate
even
more
i
will
personally
tell
you
that
one
of
my
assistants
spoke
with
mr
giuliani
just
recently
and
we
are
hoping
very
much
that
mr
giuliani
will
be
able
to
travel
to
ukraine
and
we
will
meet
once
he
comes
to
ukraine
i
just
wanted
to
assure
you
once
again
that
you
have
nobody
but
friends
around
us
i
will
make
sure
that
i
surround
myself
with
the
best
and
most
experienced
people
i
also
wanted
to
tell
you
that
we
are
friends
we
are
great
friends
and
you
mr
president
have
friends
in
our
country
so
we
can
continue
our
strategic
partnership
i
also
plan
to
surround
myself
with
great
people
and
in
addition
to
that
investigation
i
guarantee
as
the
president
of
ukraine
that
all
the
investigations
will
be
done
openly
and
candidly
that
i
can
assure
you
the
president
good
because
i
heard
you
had
a
prosecutor
who
was
very
good
and
he
was
shut
down
and
that's
really
unfair
a
lot
of
people
are
talking
about
that
the
way
they
shut
your
very
good
prosecutor
down
and
you
had
some
very
bad
people
involved
mr
giuliani
is
a
highly
respected
man
he
was
the
mayor
of
new
york
city
a
great
mayor
and
i
would
like
him
to
call
you
i
will
ask
him
to
call
you
along
with
the
attorney
general
rudy
very
much
knows
what's
happening
and
he
is
a
very
capable
guy
if
you
could
speak
to
him
that
would
be
great
the
former
ambassador
from
the
united
states
the
woman
was
bad
news
and
the
people
she
was
dealing
with
in
the
ukraine
were
bad
news
so
i
just
want
to
let
you
know
that
the
other
thing
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
that
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
prosecution
so
if
you
can
look
into
it
it
sounds
horrible
to
me
president
zelenskyy
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
the
prosecutor
first
of
all
i
understand
and
i'm
knowledgeable
about
the
situation
since
we
have
won
the
absolute
majority
in
our
parliament
the
next
prosecutor
general
will
be
my
person
my
candidate
who
will
be
approved
by
the
parliament
and
will
start
as
a
new
prosecutor
in
september
he
or
she
will
look
into
the
situation
specifically
to
the
company
that
you
mentioned
in
this
issue
the
issue
of
the
investigation
of
the
case
is
actually
the
issue
of
making
sure
to
restore
the
honesty
so
we
will
take
care
of
that
and
will
work
on
the
investigation
of
the
case
on
top
of
that
i
would
kindly
ask
you
if
you
have
any
additional
information
that
you
can
provide
to
us
it
would
be
very
helpful
for
the
investigation
to
make
sure
that
we
administer
justice
in
our
country
with
regard
to
the
ambassador
to
the
united
states
from
ukraine
as
far
as
i
recall
her
name
was
ivanovich
it
was
great
that
you
were
the
first
one
who
told
me
that
she
was
a
bad
ambassador
because
i
agree
with
you
her
attitude
towards
me
was
far
from
the
best
as
she
admired
the
previous
president
and
she
was
on
his
side
she
would
not
accept
me
as
a
new
president
well
enough
the
president
well
she's
going
to
go
through
some
things
i
will
have
mr
giuliani
give
you
a
call
and
i
am
also
going
to
have
attorney
general
barr
call
and
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i'm
sure
you
will
figure
it
out
i
heard
the
prosecutor
was
treated
very
badly
and
he
was
a
very
fair
prosecutor
so
good
luck
with
everything
your
economy
is
going
to
get
better
and
better
i
predict
you
have
a
lot
of
assets
it's
a
great
country
i
have
many
ukrainian
friends
their
incredible
people
president
zelenskyy
i
would
like
to
tell
you
that
i
also
have
quite
a
few
ukrainian
friends
that
live
in
the
united
states
actually
last
time
i
traveled
to
the
united
states
i
stayed
in
new
york
near
central
park
and
i
stayed
at
the
trump
tower
i
will
talk
to
them
and
i
hope
to
see
them
again
in
the
future
i
also
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
invitation
to
visit
the
united
states
specifically
washington
c.c.
on
the
other
hand
i
also
want
to
ensure
you
that
we
will
be
very
serious
about
the
case
and
will
work
on
the
investigation
as
to
the
economy
there
is
much
potential
for
our
two
countries
and
one
of
the
issues
that
is
very
important
for
ukraine
is
energy
independence
i
believe
we
can
be
very
successful
and
cooperating
on
energy
independence
with
united
states
we
are
already
working
on
cooperation
we
are
buying
american
oil
but
i
am
very
hopeful
for
a
future
meeting
we
will
have
more
time
and
more
opportunities
to
discuss
these
opportunities
and
get
to
know
each
other
better
i
would
like
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
support
the
president
good
well
thank
you
very
much
and
i
appreciate
that
i
will
tell
rudy
and
attorney
general
barr
to
call
thank
you
whenever
you
would
like
to
come
to
the
white
house
feel
free
to
call
give
us
a
date
and
we'll
work
that
out
i
look
forward
to
seeing
you
president
zelenskyy
thank
you
very
much
i
would
be
very
happy
to
come
and
would
be
happy
to
meet
with
you
personally
and
get
to
know
you
better
i
am
looking
forward
to
our
meeting
and
i
would
also
like
to
invite
you
to
visit
ukraine
and
come
to
the
city
of
kyiv
which
is
a
beautiful
city
we
have
a
beautiful
country
which
would
welcome
you
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
that
on
september
we
will
be
in
poland
and
we
can
meet
in
poland
hopefully
after
that
it
might
be
a
very
good
idea
for
you
to
travel
to
ukraine
we
can
either
take
my
plane
and
go
to
ukraine
or
we
can
take
your
plane
which
is
probably
much
better
than
mine
the
president
okay
we
can
work
that
out
i
look
forward
to
seeing
you
in
washington
and
maybe
in
poland
because
i
think
we
are
going
to
be
there
at
that
time
president
zelenskyy
thank
you
very
much
mr
president
the
president
congratulations
on
a
fantastic
job
you've
done
the
whole
world
was
watching
i'm
not
sure
it
was
so
much
of
an
upset
but
congratulations
president
zelenskyy
thank
you
mr
president
bye-bye
