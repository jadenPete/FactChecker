china
isn't
just
the

partner

the
head
of
the
justice
department's
national
security
division
says
it's
also
the
biggest
counterintelligence
threat
one
of
america's
most
recent
espionage
cases
started
with
a
friendly
hello
over
the
internet
it
ended
with
a
jury
in
virginia
finding
former
cia
officer
kevin
mallory
guilty
of
spying
for
china
the
mallory
case
a
rare
counterintelligence
investigation
to
go
to
trial
provides
a
lesson
in
how
chinese
spies
use
social
media
to
try
to
recruit
or
co-opt
americans
for
the
head
of
the
justice
department's
national
security
division
john
demers
it
also
highlights
a
broader
point
the
chinese
demers
told
npr
are
our
no
intelligence
threat
three
former
u.s.
intelligence
officers
were
convicted
of
or
pleaded
guilty
to
spying
for
china
over
a
recent
month
span
over
that
same
period
the
justice
department
brought
almost
a
dozen
more
china-related
cases
most
of
them
for
alleged
economic
espionage
demers
took
over
leadership
of
the
national
security
division
in
february
after
being
confirmed
by
the
senate
since
taking
the
helm
he
has
spent
a
considerable
amount
of
time
on
china
and
what
he
calls
its
prolific
espionage
efforts
against
the
united
states
they're
vast
in
scale
he
said
and
they
span
the
spectrum
from
traditional
espionage
targeting
government
secrets
to
economic
espionage
going
after
intellectual
property
and
american
trade
secrets
we
had
last
year
three
traditional
espionage
cases
all
involving
ex-intelligence
community
officers
going
at
the
same
time
that's
unprecedented
demers
said
one
of
those
cases
was
mallory
who
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
years
in
prison
the
other
two
cases
involved
former
defense
intelligence
agency
officer
ron
hansen
and
former
cia
officer
jerry
chun
shing
lee
both
of
whom
pleaded
guilty
but
there's
more
beneath
the
surface
that
the
public
doesn't
see
demers
said
take
the
three
former
intelligence
officers
cases
as
a
starting
point
he
said
and
expand
from
there
there
are
other
investigations
the
justice
department
is
running
that
haven't
resulted
in
charges
yet
he
said
and
then
there
are
the
chinese
spies
who
are
operating
whom
the
u.s.
doesn't
know
about
then
you
go
back
out
and
you
realize
how
many
americans
you
need
to
approach
before
you
can
convince
one
american
to
turn
on
his
or
her
country
demers
said
that
number
i
don't
know
what
it
is
exactly
but
it's
significantly
high
john
demers
head
of
the
justice
department's
national
security
division
told
npr
that
china's
intelligence
officers
often
approach
recruits

the
ministry
of
state
security
wants
to
connect
demers
described
a
pattern
that
has
emerged
in
the
way
chinese
intelligence
officers
try
to
recruit
americans
it's
risky
for
them
to
operate
inside
the
united
states
where
they
could
be
interdicted
by
the
fbi
so
instead
they
often
initiate
contact
over
the
internet
via
linkedin
or
other
social
media
that's
not
unusual
demers
said
we
see
the
chinese
intelligence
officers
using
social
media
platforms
to
reach
out
to
people
china's
spies
aren't
reaching
out
willy-nilly
they
do
their
research
online
to
identify
the
information
they
want
and
the
people
who
might
have
access
to
it
and
linkedin
users
often
trolling
for
new
jobs
openly
advertise
their
status
as
employees
or
former
employees
of
agencies
of
interest
with
access
to
material
that
the
chinese
want
once
recruiters
find
someone
who
seems
like
a
good
candidate
they
initiate
contact
albeit
often
with
a
light-handed
approach
obviously
they
don't
say
hey
i'm
from
the
chinese
intelligence
services
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
demers
said
instead
the
chinese
intelligence
officers
often
pose
as
an
academic
interested
in
someone's
work
or
a
businessperson
who
has
an
exciting
job
opportunity
using
that
cover
story
the
chinese
officers
try
to
lure
the
target
into
visiting
china
with
all
expenses
paid
and
slowly
they
start
to
try
to
get
information
from
this
person
demers
said
in
some
instances
chinese
intelligence
then
sustains
contact
with
its
operatives
away
from
linkedin
or
public
social
media
by
using
clandestine
or
encrypted
communications
in
mallory's
case
he
received
a
specially
outfitted
samsung
galaxy
smartphone
according
to
court
records
kevin
mallory
a
former
cia
officer
received
a
sentence
of
years
after
being
convicted
of
spying
for
china
ap

it's
a
play
that
has
also
been
used
to
target
folks
in
the
business
world
and
academia
where
china
is
hungry
for
cutting-edge
technology
and
trade
secrets
for
years
the
chinese
intelligence
services
have
hacked
into
u.s.
companies
and
made
off
with
intellectual
property
now
u.s.
officials
say
china's
spies
are
increasingly
turning
to
what
is
known
as
nontraditional
collectors
students
researchers
and
business
insiders
to
scoop
up
secrets
in
two
recent
cases
the
chinese
were
allegedly
going
after
jet
engine
technology
and
the
formula
to
produce
a
nontoxic
lining
for
food
cans
does
it
all
add
up
to
profiling
the
justice
department's
heavy
focus
on
china
has
prompted
some
lawmakers
and
members
of
the
chinese
american
community
to
worry
about
racial
profiling
by
law
enforcement
demers
said
it's
a
fair
concern
to
raise
but
he
said
the
justice
department's
focus
is
suspicious
behavior
we
don't
start
with
somebody's
ethnicity
or
their
nationality
when
we
start
doing
an
investigation
he
said
we're
looking
at
suspicious
behavior
and
we're
looking
at
the
behavior
of
the
chinese
government
he
added
that
the
chinese
government
frequently
targets
for
recruitment
chinese
nationals
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
chinese
americans
which
is
why
there
are
many
economic
espionage
cases
that
involved
chinese
nationals
but
demers
also
pointed
to
the
recent
cases
against
the
three
former
u.s.
intelligence
officers
two
of
them
are
not
of
chinese
heritage
it's
very
clear
to
us
that
loyalty
knows
no
ethnic
boundaries

said
