president
trump
vowed
on
tuesday
that
he
will
release
a
transcript
of
his
phone
call
from
earlier
this
year
with
ukraine's
president
the
july
call
is
at
the
heart
of
a
rapidly
intensifying
controversy
over
whether
trump
improperly
pressured
another
country
to
investigate
a
political
opponent
former
vice
president
joe
biden
trump's
tweet
came
shortly
before
house
democrats
were
set
to
meet
to
discuss
launching
an
impeachment
inquiry
over
possible
abuse
of
power
by
trump
as
relates
to
ukraine
and
it
appeared
to
be
an
effort
to
undercut
an
expected
announcement
from
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
despite
trump's
promise
pelosi
later
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
trump
tweeted
that
he
will
release
a
complete
fully
declassified
and
unredacted
transcript
of
my
phone
conversation
with
president
zelensky
of
ukraine
this
will
prove
it
was
a
totally
appropriate
call
he
wrote
he
says
the
transcript
will
be
released
wednesday
you
will
see
it
was
a
very
friendly
and
totally
appropriate
call
trump
wrote
no
pressure
and
unlike
joe
biden
and
his
son
no
quid
pro
quo
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
the
greatest
and
most
destructive
witch
hunt
of
all
time
trump
has
repeatedly
called
for
an
investigation
by
ukrainian
authorities
into
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden
despite
there
being
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
trump
confirmed
earlier
tuesday
that
he
ordered
military
aid
to
ukraine
blocked
a
week
before
his
call
with
the
president
of
ukraine
the
aid
was
held
up
for
months
and
trump
has
offered
conflicting
explanations
for
why
acting
white
house
chief
of
staff
and
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
mick
mulvaney
instructed
the
state
department
and
pentagon
not
to
move
forward
with
million
in
aid
for
ukraine
according
to
a
congressional
aide
the
administration
did
not
provide
any
details
on
why
it
was
withholding
the
funds
neither
the
state
department
nor
the
pentagon
had
any
policy
objections
to
the
funds
being
provided
to
ukraine
the
state
department
first
informed
omb
on
june
of
its
intent
to
obligate
the
funds
to
ukraine
omb
usually
has
five
days
to
give
what
is
seen
as
a
rubber
stamp
yes
in
this
case
omb
did
not
provide
the
green
light
until
sept
trump's
call
with
ukraine
is
also
reportedly
the
subject
of
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
administration
has
been
refusing
to
turn
over
to
congress
democrats
are
unlikely
to
be
satisfied
with
the
call's
transcript
alone
speaking
at
a
forum
sponsored
by
the
atlantic
pelosi
dismissed
trump's
claim
that
the
transcript
will
prove
he
did
nothing
wrong
it's
really
important
to
know
this
there
is
no
requirement
there
be
a
quid
pro
quo
in
the
conversation
if
the
president
brings
up
that
he
wants
them
to
investigate
something
that
is
self-evident
that
it
is
not
right
we
don't
ask
foreign
governments
to
help
in
our
elections
pelosi
said
democrats
council
of
war
ahead
of
pelosi's
announcement
about
impeachment
proceedings
trump
told
reporters
that
such
a
move
will
be
good
for
him
the
good
news
is
the
voters
get
it
trump
said
at
the
united
nations
in
new
york
this
is
why
they
say
it's
good
for
the
election
but
you
know
what
it's
bad
for
the
country
what
she's
doing
is
very
bad
meanwhile
joe
biden
was
among
the
democrats
changing
his
tune
on
impeachment
on
tuesday
a
campaign
aide
said
that
unless
the
white
house
releases
the
relevant
materials
connected
to
the
matter
biden
will
throw
his
support
behind
pelosi
and
the
house
in
pursuing
impeachment
biden
addressed
the
impeachment
issue
himself
on
tuesday
afternoon
the
much-anticipated
transcript
trump
has
acknowledged
discussing
biden
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
this
summer
that
followed
his
decision
to
suspend
military
assistance
to
ukraine
trump
has
insisted
that
there
was
never
a
quid
pro
quo
in
which
he
said
he'd
agree
to
release
aid
to
ukraine
in
exchange
for
dirt
on
biden
or
his
family
one
question
the
transcript
could
answer
is
what
specifically
trump
said
to
zelenskiy
about
investigating
biden's
son
hunter
who
once
sat
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
trump
has
gone
back
and
forth
about
whether
he
might
release
the
transcript
saying
on
one
hand
that
it
might
clear
up
the
ukraine
affair
but
on
the
other
hand
that
he
was
worried
about
the
precedent
it
might
set
trump
has
also
said
that
it
was
a
perfect
call
mostly
congratulatory
about
zelenskiy's
election
two
months
before
and
that
it
contained
nothing
inappropriate
because
the
president
was
mindful
about
the
number
of
u.s.
officials
and
others
who
might
hear
it
or
be
briefed
on
its
contents
at
the
same
time
trump
acknowledged
on
tuesday
that
he
had
suspended
u.s.
assistance
to
ukraine
before
the
phone
call
the
reason
the
president
gave
in
new
york
city
on
tuesday
was
that
he
wanted
european
governments
to
give
more
support
to
ukraine's
government
the
european
union's
mission
to
the
united
states
responded
on
tuesday
that
its
governments
have
given
more
than
billion
euros
to
ukraine
since
russia's
incursions
there
in
which
began
the
latest
phase
of
support
from
the
west
for
kyiv
u.s.
assistance
resumed
this
september
and
then
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
learned
about
a
whistleblower
inside
the
intelligence
community
who
had
filed
a
complaint
about
trump's
conversation
with
a
foreign
leader
the
justice
department
has
opined
that
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
doesn't
need
to
give
that
complaint
to
schiff
or
his
counterparts
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
pelosi
schiff
and
democrats
say
that
there
is
no
wiggle
room
in
the
law
and
that
maguire
must
give
congress
what
he
has
maguire
is
scheduled
to
appear
before
schiff's
committee
on
thursday
and
schiff
said
he
has
also
heard
from
a
lawyer
for
the
whistleblower
about
making
contact
with
his
committee
the
senate
intelligence
committee
has
also
said
it's
exploring
how
to
make
contact
with
the
whistleblower
