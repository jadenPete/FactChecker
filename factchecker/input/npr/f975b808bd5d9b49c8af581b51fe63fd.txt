embraced

name
when
in

launched
the
caucus
an
official

organization
registered
in
the

the

caucus
was
driven
by
a
desire
to
counterbalance
the
weight
of

believe
that
rebuilding

is
key

in

were
licking
their
wounds
main

caucus
republicans
had
been
hit
hardest
in
the
election
house
incumbents
defeated
and
they
wanted
to
question
chamberlain
about
her
organization's
political
decision-making
in
at
issue
was
still
resting
in
defending
main

the
outfit's
superpac
one
of
at
least
five
political
or
advocacy
organizations
under
the
rmsp
umbrella
run
by
chamberlain
and
why
those
resources
hadn't
been
deployed
to
any
number
of
competitive
races
where
they
could
have
made
a
difference
chamberlain
defended
her
work
pointing
to
the
republicans
who
survived
with
the
help
of
significant
resources
nearly
million
from
the
rmsp
network
rmsp
told
npr
that
wasn't
spent
because
those
funds
had
been
earmarked
for
that
nov
meeting
set
off
a
cascading
series
of
events
over
the
next
two
months
lawmakers
demanded
and
were
denied
an
audit
of
rmsp's
activities
lawmakers
ultimately
abandoned
the
member
caucus
and
others
quietly
distanced
themselves
from
rmsp
and
chamberlain
today
lawmakers
still
don't
have
answers
to
their
questions
about
how
chamberlain
runs
the
organization
and
whether
it
might
be
running
afoul
of
campaign
finance
and
tax
laws
it
just
all
smelled
really
bad
said
one
former
gop
lawmaker
with
direct
knowledge
of
these
events
this
previously
unreported
account
highlights
a
major
breakdown
within
the
centrist
wing
of
the
gop
in
the
wake
of
the
midterms
and
exposes
ongoing
concern
that
the
infrastructure
won't
be
there
to
help
recruit
and
win
in
swing
districts
in
in
a
statement
rmsp
defended
its
work
and
chamberlain
and
it
rebutted
the
accusations
lodged
at
the
organization
it
is
not
surprising
that
sarah
chamberlain
is
being
attacked
rmsp
is
the
only
republican
organization
other
than
the
rnc
that
is
led
by
a

said
rmsp
board
member
doug
ose
who
provided
written
responses
to
a
series
of
questions
from
npr
on
behalf
of
himself
and
chamberlain
we
are
the
leading
experts
on
issues
affecting
suburban
women
and
are
very
proud
that
under
sarah's
leadership
rmsp
has
experienced
over
years
of
productive
scandal

davis

declined

when
contacted
by

the
november
meeting
left
members
uneasy
even
before
election
day
sources
said
there
was
a
growing
list
of
questions
about
chamberlain's
leadership
of
rmsp
which
raises
money
based
on
its
perceived
close
relationship
with
these
very
members
the
republican
main

caucus
shared
the
branding
of
republican
main

but
there
was
no
official
or
legal
link
between
the
two
at
a
follow-up
caucus
meeting
on
dec
again
at
the
capitol
hill
club
chamberlain
was
asked
to
give
a
political
presentation
to
lawmakers
on
rmsp's
activities
in
it
she
referenced
an
organization
women
women
that
was
part
of
the
group's
network
and
that
many
members
had
never
heard
of
triggering
a
new
set
of
alarms
about
how
she
was
running
the
organization
after
chamberlain
left
that
meeting
members
voted
unanimously
in
support
of
a
resolution
written
by
caucus
member
rep
john
katko

y.
a
former
federal
prosecutor
to
suspend
political
activity
with

could
be
conducted
katko's
office
did
not
dispute
the
account
as
described
here
by
npr
but
declined
to
comment
members
also
agreed
that
the
recently
defeated
denham
would
serve
as
their
liaison
and
the
caucus
informed
rmsp
of
their
decision
concerns
were
subsequently
laid
out
in
a
dec
memo
detailed
below
titled
structure
of
the
republican
main
street
partnership
affiliated
entities
and
potential
concerns
that
was
circulated
among
a
small
group
of
lawmakers
congressional
aides
and
rmsp
board
members
the
memo
was
sent
to
npr
by
an
anonymous
source
and
was
then
authenticated
by
a
former
denham
aide
and
then
it
all
started
to
fall
apart
recalled
one
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
events
the
source
said
that
in
late
january
former
rep
doug
ose
r-calif
a
member
of
the
rmsp
board
met
with
republican
main
street
caucus
lawmakers
and
told
them
that
their
request
for
the
audit
was
denied
we're
a
private
organization
you
have
no
right
to
any
of
this
was
ose's
message
the
source
recalled
ose
confirmed
the
source's
account
my
interaction
with
lawmakers
has
been
direct
he
said
that
means
sometimes
i
must
tell
them
no
in
order
to
legally
protect
them
from
themselves
and
or
their
staff
ose
said
rmsp
denied
the
audit
because
lawmakers
are
legally
not
allowed
to
exercise
any
control
over
an
outside
organization
lawmakers
were
stunned
and
now
more
concerned
than
ever
about
what
was
going
on
at
rmsp
sources
said
what
is
it
about
the
organization
that
would
be
so
sensitive
that
it
couldn't
be
shared
with
allied

said
that
although
lawmakers
had
no
legal
right
to
an
audit
there
is
nothing
legally
barring
rmsp
from
conducting
one
for
them
it's
a
big
ask
to
say
to
a
member
of
congress
hey
work
with
us
and
we
won't
tell
you
where
our
money
is
coming
from
or
where
it's
going
that
raises
red
flags
he
said
without
any
avenues
for
recourse
sources
said
several
of
the
caucus's
most
prominent
and
influential
members
privately
decided
they
would
distance
themselves
from
rmsp
including
davis
as
well
as
reps
tom
emmer
of
minnesota
and
susan

of

early
february
republicans
decided
not
to
renew
the
republican
main
street
caucus
as
a

organization
in
this
congress
essentially
dissolving
the
group
it
is
no
longer
registered
in
the
official
list
of
member
organizations
in
this
congress
at
some
point
earlier
this
year
rmsp
removed
davis
from
its
affiliated
member
list
on
the
group's
website
there
is
no
way
for
lawmakers
to
join
or
quit
rmsp
a
former
rmsp
employee
told
npr
that
if
a
member
ever
accepted
a
donation
from
the
organization
that
member
was
promoted
as
an
rmsp
member
ose
said
davis
asked
to
be
removed
from
rmsp's
website
and
we
complied
with
his
wishes
davis
declined
to
comment
a
web
of
allegations
sarah
is
the
only
person
in
a
position
to
know
the
dec
memo
obtained
by
npr
detailed
concerns
that
members
were
being
used
to
raise
money
on
behalf
of
entities
that
pay
large
sums
to
staff
without
proper
oversight
and
estimated
at
least
in
compensation
paid
to
chamberlain
based
on
data
culled
from
disclosure
reports
given
sarah
chamberlain
is
officially
the
president
and
ceo
and
treasurer
of
each
entity
this
raises
significant
conflict
issues
her
salary
represents
roughly
of
the
rmsp
operating
budget
the
memo
states
ose
disputed
the
figure
and
said
chamberlain's
total
compensation
for
was
ose
categorically
rejected
the
allegations
outlined
in
the
memo
and
said
rmsp
is
very
careful
about
complying
with
the
law
he
also
said
rmsp
made
available
to
rmsp
members
copies
of
internal
financial
audit
reports
for
rmsp
entities
rmsp
provided
npr
with
those
documents
which
can
be
viewed
here
and
here
however
lawmakers
wanted
an
independent
audit
one
that
would
include
an
assessment
of
the
organization's
structure
management
and
objectives
the
memo
includes
a
bullet-point
list
of
concerns
regarding
chamberlain's
near-total
control
over
rmsp
and
its
related
fundraising
and
advocacy
arms
how
can
we
disprove
a
co-mingling
issue
when
the
president
and
treasurer
of
all
organizations
is
the
same
person
the
memo
states
how
does
money
flow
between
each
entity
is
there
any
wall
in
place
if
so
how
do
we
prove
it
sarah
is
the
only
person
in
a
position
to
know
as
the
only
check
signer
chamberlain
is
the
president
and
ceo
and
sits
on
the
board
of
rmsp
but
she
also
runs
the
group's
superpac
and
the
group
women
women
chamberlain
was
also
listed
as
the
treasurer
of
the
republican
mainstreet
partnership
pac
at
the
time
the
memo
was
written
but
documents
filed
with
the
federal
election
commission
after
the
midterms
now
list
ose
as
treasurer
a
decision
that
ose
said
was
made
out
of
respect
for
rmsp
members
the
memo
alleges
chamberlain
engaged
in
personal
behavior
that
violated
campaign
finance
laws
that
ban
direct
coordination
between
candidates
and
outside
groups
sarah
chamberlain
has
consistently
been
witnessed
telling
members
of
congress
that
she
has
a
superpac
if
you
need
help
in
your
race
just
call
me
in
addition
sarah
frequently
calls
on
members
to
direct
donors
to
her
so
she
can
earmark
money
for
their
races
each
of
these
actions
is
against
the
law
ose
did
not
respond
directly
to
npr's
question
about
whether
chamberlain
ever
engaged
in
the
behavior
described
in
the
memo
we
make
clear
what
we
are
working
on
and
keep
our
ears
open
he
said
chamberlain's
personal
focus
on
the
women
women
initiative
also
raised
questions
among
caucus
members
about
her
political
judgement
the
memo
asks
why
she
was
in
gop
rep
steve
knight's
california
swing
district
days
before
the
midterm
election
promoting
women
women
at
an
event
featuring
actress
vivica
a.
fox
which
was
unrelated
to
the
gop's
efforts
to
hold
seats
in
the
closing
days
before
the
election
a
nov
instagram
post
under
the
women
women
account
corroborates
this
featuring
a
picture
with
chamberlain
and
the
actress
knight
was
one
of
the
gop
incumbents
who
lost
on
election
day
the
memo
questions
how
women
women
promotes
the
core
mission
of
rmsp
to
elect
and
support
centrist
republicans
and
whether
it
amounts
to
little
more
than
a
vanity
project
members
have
been
informed
that
main
street
pays
two
publicists
to
book
media
and
promote
sarah
chamberlain
who
pays
for
this
the
memo
states
members
are
under
the
impression
that
rmsp
exists
to
promote
the
members
is
this
consistent
with
that
mission
asked
if
chamberlain
had
any
response
to
the
concerns
raised
by
lawmakers
about
her
management
of
the
organization
during
the
election
ose
responded
no
upon
examination
of
the
facts
and
review
of
public
documents
the
allegations
were
shown
to
be
inaccurate
however
three
sources
said
there
was
internal
turmoil
at
rmsp
over
the
clash
between
lawmakers
and
chamberlain
sources
said
an
rmsp
board
member
jennifer
latourette
quietly
left
in
march
when
it
became
clear
rmsp
would
not
comply
with
lawmakers
request
for
a
full
governance
audit
of
the
organization
she
is
no
longer
listed
as
a
board
member
on
its
website
when
reached
by
telephone
by
npr
latourette
declined
to
comment
her
late
husband
the
former
rep
steve
latourette
r-ohio
was
the
head
of
the
republican
main
street
partnership
until
his
death
from
pancreatic
cancer
in
august
it
didn't
used
to
be
like
that
under
latourette
the
same
former
gop
lawmaker
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
situation
said
there
were
checks
and
balances
everybody
had
faith
that
we
had
somebody
that
understood
the
law
and
ethics
and
had
members
best
interests
in
mind
a
closer
look
at
women
women
the
best
part
of
my
job
it
is
chamberlain's
most
recent
initiative
that
provoked
one
of
the
angriest
reactions
from
capitol
hill
initially
launched
as
an
effort
to
promote
gop
women
lawmakers
chamberlain
is
rebranding
it
as
a
nonpartisan
outfit
to
promote
suburban
women's
issues
last
month
on
july
npr
attended
an
on-the-record
briefing
with
chamberlain
in
which
she
promoted
her
women
women
conversations
tour
npr
was
not
aware
of
the
allegations
against
chamberlain
until
after
the
briefing
which
prompted
further
reporting
that
led
to
this
story
this
is
the
best
part
of
my
job
she
told
reporters
characterizing
the
initiative
as
a
whole
empowerment
event
during
which
she
conducts
focus
groups
with
college-educated
suburban
professional
women
voters
in
the
to-
year-old
demographic
the
tour
has
already
taken
her
to
columbia
s.c.
pittsburgh
austin
texas
and
chicago
this
year
and
stops
are
planned
in
five
additional
cities
chamberlain
said
she
does
not
ask
about
politics
at
these
events
just
the
issues
that
concern
this
core
swing-vote
demographic
however
she
said
she
then
takes
the
data
culled
from
these
focus
groups
and
uses
the
data
to
inform
republican
lawmakers
in
private
briefings
so
what
we
do
is
we
then
get
to
come
back
talk
to
the
members
in
september
the
members
of
main
street
will
get
a
full
briefing
on
what
suburban
women
are
talking
about
she
told
reporters
chamberlain
said
the
women
are
aware
that
she
uses
these
sessions
to
meet
with
members
of
congress
they
like
it
because
it's
a
direct
tie
back
to
the
officials
so
even
though
i
take
off
my
ceo
of
main
street
hat
they
all
know
that
what
they
tell
me
and
what
we
learn
i
can
bring
back
to
the
members
of
congress
at
the
same
time
chamberlain
insisted
it
is
a
totally
separate
part
of
main
street
she
said
women
women
events
have
been
conducted
in
rmsp
members
congressional
districts
but
when
we're
in
that
district
we
don't
even
talk
about
the
member
she
said
the
law
prohibits
nonprofits
from
supporting
partisan
campaign
activity
according
to
a
determination
letter
from
the
internal
revenue
service
dated
june
women
women
qualifies
as
of
june
for
a
c
tax
designation
which
is
given
to
nonprofit
groups
and
allows
donors
to
make
tax-deductible
contributions
further
women
women
identifies
as
a
c
on
its
official
instagram
page
chamberlain's
admission
that
she
uses
women
women
focus
group
data
to
provide
insights
to
benefit
republicans
raises
a
red
flag
said
noti
of
the
campaign
legal
center
if
it's
information
to
be
used
for
campaign
purposes
here's
what
your
constituents
are
talking
about
and
here's
what
you
need
to
say
or
do
to
get
reelected
that's
impermissible
noti
said
maybe
they're
very
careful
about
how
they
word
it
to
try
to
walk
that
fine
line
but
that
is
certainly
getting
very
very
close
to
if
not
across
the
border
of
legality
when
asked
how
women
women
could
engage
in
political
activity
ose
said
women
women's
application
for
c
status
is
not
yet
finalized
despite
irs
documentation
to
the
contrary
when
it
is
finalized
we
will
comply
with
laws
governing
c
organizations
ose
said
npr
contacted
mark
diskin
a
d.c.
based
tax
attorney
who
said
he
is
not
aware
of
any
finalization
process
once
you
receive
a
determination
letter
from
the
irs
you
are
considered
a
c
diskin
said
the
impact
it's
been
heartbreaking
to
watch
the
quiet
implosion
of
the
relationship
between
the
republican
main
street
caucus
and
the
republican
main
street
partnership
comes
at
a
consequential
time
for
the
gop
the
party
is
struggling
to
recruit
more
centrist
diverse
female
candidates
to
give
republicans
a
fighting
chance
at
winning
a
house
majority
again
in
now
is
the
time
we
need
it
said
one
source
it's
been
heartbreaking
to
watch
said
a
second
source
who
added
we
saw
so
much
opportunity
to
really
build
a
first-class
infrastructure
the
pervasive
ongoing
concerns
about
chamberlain
and
her
management
simply
raised
too
many
red
flags
to
continue
work
in
a
caucus
that
shared
its
name
multiple
sources
said
lawmakers
in
the
republican
main
street
caucus
had
no
oversight
of
the
private
republican
main
street
partnership
or
control
over
its
decision-making
but
politically
the
public
would
be
less
likely
to
differentiate
the
two
if
it
were
ever
caught
up
in
a
scandal
anytime
you're
raising
and
spending
money
based
on
your
access
to
and
relationship
with
members
they
have
a
right
to
ask
if
it's
being
done
transparently
and
legally
said
one
gop
lawmaker
who
was
in
the
republican
main
street
caucus
the
concern
in
this
case
is
that
it
wasn't
lawmakers
considered
rebranding
the
caucus
for
this
congress
but
decided
against
it
two
sources
said
another
moderate
faction
the
tuesday
group
continues
to
exist
with
a
seat
at
the
leadership
meeting
table
and
many
former
republican
main
street
caucus
members
participate
in
that
caucus
members
have
gotten
more
involved
in
that
that
has
now
become
the
caucus
the
place
to
discuss
policy
the
former
gop
lawmaker
said
rmsp
blamed
the
fallout
with
lawmakers
on
disgruntled
individuals
to
paraphrase
winston
churchill
i
have
never
seen
so
few
people
use
so
many
exaggerations
to
create
such
chaos
ose
said
fortunately
i
have
direct
access
and
knowledge
of
the
actual
facts
and
have
exhausted
time
and
resources
clarifying
the
truth
meanwhile
the
next

event
will
be
held
