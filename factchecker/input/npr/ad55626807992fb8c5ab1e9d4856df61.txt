aimed

decide
which

to

security
is
a
major
focus
in
the
presidential
race
with
five
months
before
primary
season
begins
election
officials
around
the
country
are
busy
buying
new
voting
equipment
their
main
focus
is
security
after
russians
tried
to
hack
into
u.s.
election
systems
in
intelligence
officials
have
warned
that
similar
attacks
are
likely
in
from
either
russia
or
others
intent
on
disrupting
u.s.
elections
federal
state
and
local
authorities
are
trying
to
improve
the
security
of
the
nation's
voting
systems
before
that
happens
one
way
they're
doing
that
is
by
purchasing
more
machines
that
produce
paper
ballots
which
can
be
used
to
verify
results
in
the
event
of
a
cyberattack
on
electronic
systems
the
brennan
center
for
justice
estimates
that
nearly
percent
of
americans
will
cast
their
ballots
on
paper-based
systems
in
compared
with
percent
in
that
still
means
about
million
voters
will
use
paperless
machines
election
security
experts
and
intelligence
community
members
agree
that
paperless
voting
machines
are
insecure
and
that
we
need
to
transition
to
paper-based
voting
systems
across
the
country
to
ensure
that
in
the
event
of
a
question
or
a
concern
we
can
go
back
and
look
at
the
paper
records
for
every
vote
cast
says
liz
howard
of
brennan's
democracy
program
sprint
in
the
commonwealth
pennsylvania
is
among
the
states
making
major
changes
in
response
to
those
concerns
gov
tom
wolf
a
democrat
has
ordered
all
counties
to
replace
their
existing
machines
by
next
year
with
ones
that
produce
a
voter-verifiable
paper
record
that's
a
massive
and
costly
undertaking
with
an
estimated
price
tag
of
as
much
as
million
but
officials
believe
most
of
the
counties
are
on
track
to
make
the
change
before
the
state's
primary
in
april
about
residents
of
bucks
county
just
north
of
philadelphia
turned
out
at
a
local
community
college
recently
to
weigh
in
their
county's
machine-buying
decision
it
was
a
little
like
a
speed-dating
event
as
the
residents
moved
around
a
large
meeting
room
checking
out
one
display
after
another
they
held
paper
surveys
on
which
they
could
mark
which
machines
they
liked
best
and
why
dolores
mucci
an
election
judge
from
bensalem
township
came
with
some
fellow
poll
workers
who
were
especially
interested
in
how
easy
the
equipment
would
be
for
voters
to
use
if
voting
becomes
too
hard
for
someone
they're
not
going
to
vote
said
mucci
she
told
a
sales
representative
from
dominion
voting
one
of
the
five
vendors
competing
for
the
contract
that
she
liked
one
of
the
systems
he
showed
her
it
was
a
machine
that
allows
voters
to
make
their
choices
using
a
touchscreen
when
the
voter
is
done
the
machine
prints
out
the
marked
paper
ballot
which
is
then
fed
into
a
scanner
to
be
counted
mucci
wasn't
as
keen
on
another
option
he
showed
her
a
pre-printed
paper
ballot
that
voters
mark
the
old-fashioned
way
with
a
pen
nearby
another
vendor
election
systems
software
showed
a
third
option
a
big
touchscreen
machine
that
prints
the
voter's
choices
on
a
blank
piece
of
paper
which
is
then
displayed
in
a
window
for
review
if
it's
how
you
want
to
vote
you
press
another
button
explained
kathy
dornan
it
tabulates
it
and
drops
it
into
a
ballot
box
so
that
one
is
one-stop
shopping
instead
of
a
two-fold
system
one
event-goer
nodded
approvingly
that
eliminates
a
step

paper
is
only

beginning

an

in

advocates

are

in
a
new
era
of
security
challenges
eliminating
steps
was
pretty
popular
with
the
bucks
county
crowd
although
many
security
experts
believe
that
anything
short
of
a
hand-marked
ballot
presents
a
risk
still
marian
schneider
a
former
pennsylvania
election
official
thinks
whatever
the
counties
decide
this
state
is
in
much
better
shape
than
it
was
in
when
more
than
percent
of
its
machines
had
no
paper
records
you
couldn't
check
them
whatever
the
computer
said
the
computer
said
you
were
done
schneider
says
this
is
a
sea
change
for
pennsylvania
and
it's
a
good
thing
but
schneider
who
runs
verified
voting
a
national
group
that's
long
promoted
paper
ballots
also
says
paper
alone
is
not
enough
you
have
to
check
the
paper
afterwards
you
have
to
randomly
sample
those
ballots
and
make
sure
that
the
results
that
the
software
reported
matches
what's
on
the
paper
ballots
she
says
she's
talking
about
something
called
a
risk-limiting
audit
which
is
becoming
an
increasingly
popular
way
to
verify
election
results
pennsylvania
is
among
a
dozen
states
now
testing
the
idea
the
changes
are
all
part
of
a
multi-pronged
national
effort
to
protect
next
year's
elections
kathy
boockvar
pennsylvania's
acting
secretary
says
her
state
like
others
has
also
been
working
with
the
u.s.
department
of
homeland
security
and
has
participated
in
tabletop
exercises
to
practice
responding
to
cyberattacks
boockvar's
office
also
has
stepped
up
coordination
with
emergency
managers
and
is
now
in
closer
communication
with
other
states
and
the
federal
government
about
potential
risks
all
those
layers
build
not
only
the
wall
of
protection
but
the
wall
of
confidence
for
each
voter
to
know
that
their
vote
is
secure
and
their
vote
is
being
counted
accurately
she
says
but
boockvar
also
warned
about
the
need
for
a
new
attitude
about
administering
elections
given
that
the
state
of
cyber-threats
evolves
as
quickly
or
quicker
than
states
technology
or
safeguards
it's
a
race
without
a
finish
line
she
says
so
the
key
is
that
we
have
to
be
building
and
reinforcing
walls
faster
than
those
trying
to
tear
them
down
authorities
could
do
more
like
other
election
officials
boockvar
says
pennsylvania
could
use
more
resources
congress
approved
million
last
year
for
election
security
but
pennsylvania
received
only
million
of
that
liz
howard
of
the
brennan
center
says
her
group
estimates
that
states
could
easily
use
another
billion
over
the
next
five
years
especially
to
protect
local
election
offices
which
tend
to
be
more
vulnerable
with
over
election
jurisdictions
across
the
country
there's
some
not
insubstantial
portion
of
them
that
do
not
have
it
support
at
the
local
level
she
says
howard
also
notes
that
some
states
have
used
their
security
funding
to
hire
specialists
they
call
cybernavigators
it
professionals
who
travel
to
local
election
offices
to
help
them
figure
out
whether
their
systems
are
vulnerable
and
what
steps
need
to
be
taken
to
close
the
gap
still
at
the
bucks
county
demo
security
was
clearly
a
secondary
concern
for
many
of
the
residents
like
milo
morris
what
he
wants
are
machines
that
are
easy
to
use
and
fast
i
don't
want
to
see
voters
get
bogged
down
once
they
get
into
the
voting
booth
you
know
cause
all
that
does
is
discourage
the
practice
altogether
he
said
and
we
need
everybody
to
come
out
and
vote
bucks
county
is
expected
to
make
a
decision
on
what
machines
to
buy
by
the
end
of
the
year
