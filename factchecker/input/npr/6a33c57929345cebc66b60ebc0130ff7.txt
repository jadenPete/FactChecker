democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
at
the
iowa
federation
labor
convention
last
week
in
altoona
iowa
after
a
gunman
shot
and
killed
people
at
an
el
paso
texas
walmart
earlier
this
month
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
decided
to
take
a
hiatus
from
the
presidential
campaign
to
return
to
his
hometown
now
o'rourke
is
back
on
the
campaign
trail
reinvigorated
with
a
focus
on
the
president
and
the
racial
division
he
says
trump
has
stirred
in
the
country
he
mentions
el
paso
frequently
both
on
the
stump
and
in
interviews
it's
clear
the
shooting
and
the
fact
that
latinos
were
targeted
has
troubled
him
it's
become
the
raison
d
tre
of
his
campaign
law
enforcement's
top
priority
he
says
should
be
combating
white
nationalism
and
white
supremacy
o'rourke
also
is
fixated
on
trump
these
days
if
we
don't
call
this
country's
attention
to
the
true
cost
and
consequence
of
donald
trump
then
the
blame
will
be
on
us
every
one
of
us
who
was
complicit
in
our
silence
o'rourke
said
in
an
interview
with
the
npr
politics
podcast
and
iowa
public
radio
but
he
resisted
the
idea
that
focusing
on
the
president
would
somehow
define
his
campaign
o'rourke
became
a
darling
of
the
left
during
the
midterms
for
his
challenge
to
republican
incumbent
sen
ted
cruz
he
was
widely
perceived
as
the
underdog
but
lost
the
race
by
just
percentage
points
coming
closer
to
winning
a
statewide
office
than
any
other
democrat
in
years
and
because
of
the
notoriety
he
gained
in
the
midterms
he
entered
the
democratic
presidential
primary
as
a
sort
of
political
celebrity
he
raised
more
than
million
in
the
hours
after
he
announced
his
campaign
but
he's
consistently
trailed
in
early
polls
struggled
to
articulate
why
he's
running
and
failed
to
have
a
breakout
moment
on
the
crowded
debate
stage
at
times
his
lofty
rhetoric
can
seem
to
cloud
his
actual
policy
priorities
so
we
asked
him
if
he
had
to
prioritize
one
landmark
bill
what
would
it
be
there
is
no
one
bill
he
said
and
then
gave
a
long
answer
detailing
his
concerns
about
a
range
of
issues
from
climate
change
to
health
care
and
immigration
pundits
and
voters
agree
that
o'rourke
is
not
doing
as
well
in
this
contest
as
they
expected
as
his
odds
have
dimmed
the
pressure
on
him
to
withdraw
from
the
presidential
race
and
instead
run
for
the
u.s.
senate
has
increased
even
some
of
his
fervent
fans
from
the
race
in
texas
have
suggested
he
should
focus
on
mounting
a
challenge
to
sen
john
cornyn
who
will
be
up
for
reelection
in
but
o'rourke
dismisses
that
idea
i
think
i
have
a
perspective
that
is
important
for
this
country
at
this
moment
he
said
on
president
trump
the
terrifying
and
terrorizing
raids
like
the
one
he
authorized
in
mississippi
are
part
of
a
larger
trend
of
action
and
attacks
against
immigrants
against
people
who
do
not
look
like
or
pray
like
or
love
like
the
majority
in
this
country
and
if
that
continues
i'm
confident
that
we'll
lose
this
country
we
really
will
i
liken
it
to
being
a
country
that
is
asleep
and
a
country
that
will
die
in
its
sleep
unless
it
wakes
up
to
the
threat
that
it
faces
and
that
threat
very
clearly
is
donald
trump
on
his
focus
on
white
nationalism
o'rourke's
plan
to
tackle
gun
violence
explicitly
links
guns
with
white
nationalism
with
gun
violence
deaths
in
this
country
not
all
of
them
are
connected
to
white
nationalism
white
supremacy
or
white
terrorism
but
you
do
have
to
connect
the
hatred
the
racism
the
president's
words
and
actions
with
the
accessibility
of
those
weapons
that
afford
someone
the
means
to
conduct
this
kind
of
terror
in
this
country
if
i
don't
connect
these
dots
then
i
am
complicit
in
the
next
mass
murder
or
the
next
act
of
domestic
terror
on
border
security
there's
a
great
leader
in
my
community
years
ago
we
were
on
a
conference
on
just
this
issue
in
el
paso
and
he
said
if
you
want
to
secure
your
communities
if
we
want
to
secure
the
border
treat
people
with
respect
and
dignity
el
paso
texas
is
one
of
if
not
the
safest
cities
in
the
united
states
it's
safe
not
despite
but
because
we're
a
city
of
immigrants
because
we're
connected
to
mexico
and
we
see
all
of
those
as
fundamental
to
our
strength
and
our
success
and
our
security
on
why
despite
the
pressure
he's
not
dropping
out
to
run
for
the
u.s.
senate
i
want
to
serve
this
country
as
president
and
i
think
i
have
a
perspective
that
is
important
for
this
country
at
this
moment
as
donald
trump
vilifies
and
demonizes
the
border
communities
of
immigrants
seeks
to
make
us
afraid
warns
of
invasions
and
infestations
and
calls
those
who
come
to
this
country
killers
and
predators
and
animals
it
is
in
a
community
of
immigrants
on
the
u.s.
mexico
border
that
i
was
raised
i
think
i
can
tell
a
very
powerful
a
very
positive
story
of
the
contribution
that
immigrants
make
to
the
success
of
this
country
in
texas
going
to
every
one
of
those
counties
on
a
very
progressive
agenda
we
helped
to
take
a
state
that
had
ranked
near
the
bottom
in
voter
turnout
written
off
as
too
red
and
republican
to
count
to
one
that
gave
us
more
votes
than
any
democrat
had
ever
received
and
brought
nearly
half
a
million
republicans
along
with
us
helped
to
flip
two
congressional
seats
and
elect
african
american
women
to
judicial
positions
in
harris
county
literally
changing
the
face
of
criminal
justice
in
this
country's
most
diverse
city
it's
that
kind
of
perspective
that
kind
of
campaigning
that
way
of
bringing
people
in
at
a
very
divided
time
that's
the
way
you
beat
donald
trump
i
think
that's
also
the
way
you
that
reunite
this
polarized
country
in
the
face
of
these
challenges
so
that
we
can
overcome
them
