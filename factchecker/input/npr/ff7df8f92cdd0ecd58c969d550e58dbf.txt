ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
on
wednesday
unveiled
a
package
of
anti-poverty
proposals
to
give
more
people
including
undocumented
immigrants
access
to
federal
benefits
such
as
medicaid
the
bills
packaged
as
a
bundle
called
a
just
society
would
expand
access
to
benefits
by
updating
the
federal
poverty
line
to
include
expenses
like
child
care
and
internet
access
and
be
adjusted
based
on
where
someone
lives
about
million
americans
live
in
poverty
according
to
the
u.s.
census
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
that
we
can
get
done
is
build
popular
support
in
acknowledging
how
bad
the
problem
already
is
in
doing
so
we
can
actually
begin
to
fundamentally
address
those
problems
ocasio-cortez
told
npr's
steve
inskeep
if
we
can
acknowledge
how
many
americans
are
actually
in
poverty
i
think
that
we
can
start
to
address
some
of
the
more
systemic
issues
in
our
economy
she
spoke
to
npr
on
tuesday
ahead
of
a
closed-door
afternoon
meeting
of
the
democratic
caucus
where
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
confirmed
plans
to
launch
an
impeachment
inquiry
calls
among
democrats
for
impeachment
have
grown
recently
as
reporting
emerged
that
president
trump
allegedly
pressured
the
ukrainian
leader
to
investigate
political
rival
joe
biden
ocasio-cortez
has
been
critical
of
her
party's
reluctance
on
impeachment
and
in
the
interview
she
said
she
appreciated
her
colleagues
concerns
that
proceedings
could
be
a
political
risk
but
she
said
the
risk
is
necessary
i
think
that
those
concerns
are
understandable
but
the
actions
that
trump
has
been
taking
to
essentially
dismantle
our
democracy
i
think
take
precedent
over
that
she
said
on
proposing
access
to
benefits
to
immigrants
regardless
of
citizenship
status
immigrants
pay
taxes
and
when
we
begin
to
unify
our
systems
i
think
that
we
will
get
more
cohesive
immigration
policy
economic
policy
political
policy
and
i
think
it
sends
a
message
that
if
you
contribute
to
our
society
you
should
benefit
from
our
society
why
should
a
billionaire
who
evades
taxes
collect
social
security
too
i
think
that
what
we
can
do
is
we
can
tighten
up
our
systems
and
increase
accountability
but
what
this
says
is
that
we
will
not
discriminate
solely
based
on
immigration
status
on
the
green
new
deal
a
nonbinding
resolution
having
an
effect
on
public
conversation
without
having
been
passed
by
the
house
i
think
the
conversation
that
the
green
new
deal
sparked
like
if
i
had
to
decide
would
i
rather
have
the
resolution
passed
or
would
i
have
rather
preferred
we
start
a
national
conversation
about
the
urgency
of
the
climate
crisis
i
would
have
chosen
the
latter
every
single
time
on
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
role
and
why
she's
supporting
more
progressive
challengers
to
democratic
house
seats
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
where
the
balance
of
the
party
is
so
being
a
speaker
is
not
a
very
enviable
job
you're
kind
of
herding
cats
but
i
think
we
need
to
take
progressives
in
the
party
as
seriously
as
we're
taking
conservatives
in
the
party
