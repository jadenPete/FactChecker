updated

et
manufacturing
activity
shifted
into
reverse
in
august
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
as
factory
owners
adjusted
to
the
ongoing
trade
wars
an
index
compiled
by
the
institute
for
supply
management
showed
a
decline
in
nearly
every
measure
including
new
orders
production
and
employment
the
index
had
been
signaling
a
slowdown
in
manufacturing
since
april
but
the
august
reading
is
the
first
to
show
an
actual
contraction
of
the
factory
sector
since
august
of
trade
remains
the
most
significant
issue
said
ism's
timothy
fiore
who
compiled
the
index
ongoing
tensions
with
china
and
other
trading
partners
led
to
a
sharp
drop
in
export
orders
while
also
disrupting
supply
chains
for
factories
that
produce
for
customers
here
at
home
while
business
is
strong
there
is
an
undercurrent
of
fear
and
alarm
regarding
the
trade
wars
one
manufacturer
in
the
chemical
industry
told
ism
manufacturing
is
definitely
impacted
tremendously
through
uncertainty
said
lisa
winton
ceo
of
the
winton
machine
company
in
suwanee
ga
when
we
are
shipping
capital
equipment
and
it
has
a
four-month
lead
time
people
want
to
know
in
four
months
when
they're
paying
for
that
product
that
they're
not
going
to
have
an
additional
tariff
the
manufacturing
sector
has
added
jobs
in
the
past
three
years
but
the
pace
of
growth
has
slowed
substantially
from
an
average
of
jobs
per
month
last
year
to
fewer
than
jobs
per
month
in
the
first
seven
months
of
this
year
the
average
factory
workweek
has
also
shrunk
according
to
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
people
are
laying
off
third-
and
second-shifts
and
going
down
to
hours
or
hours
that
doesn't
seem
so
exciting
said
nicole
wolter
ceo
of
hm
manufacturing
in
wauconda
ill
manufacturing
accounts
for
just
over
of
all
the
jobs
in
the
u.s.
and
the
sector
is
more
sensitive
than
most
to
the
effects
of
a
global
slowdown
the
question
for
the
broader
economy
is
whether
the
slump
will
remain
limited
to
the
manufacturing
sector
or
spread
to
the
much
larger
services
sector
so
far
the
broader
economy
has
been
propped
up
by
robust
consumer
spending
with
low
unemployment
and
steady
if
unspectacular
wage
growth
that
could
continue
but
gregory
daco
of
oxford
economics
said
the
factory
slowdown
could
have
spillover
effects
if
it
rattles
consumers
the
main
channel
is
going
to
be
via
confidence
that
is
gradually
going
to
erode
as
well
as
via
financial
markets
which
have
already
started
to
show
some
initial
signs
of
worry
as
the
trade
tensions
have
increased
daco
said
a
university
of
michigan
survey
released
last
week
showed
tariffs
have
begun
eating
into
consumers
confidence
and
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
tumbled
points
or
more
than
on
tuesday
