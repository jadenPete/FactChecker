monday
at

general
assembly
stating
that
abortion
is
not

human
right
the
trump
administration
is
calling
on
u.n.
member
nations
to
oppose
efforts
to
promote
access
to
abortion
internationally
a
move
immediately
criticized
by
reproductive
rights
groups
seeking
greater
access
to
the
services
globally
at
a
meeting
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
on
monday
u.s.
health
and
human
services
secretary
alex
azar
spoke
on
behalf
of
the
u.s.
and
more
than
a
dozen
other
countries
stating
that
abortion
is
not
an
international
human
right
we
do
not
support
references
to
ambiguous
terms
and
expressions
such
as
sexual
and
reproductive
health
and
rights
in
u.n.
documents
because
they
can
undermine
the
critical
role
of
the
family
and
promote
practices
like
abortion
in
circumstances
that
do
not
enjoy
international
consensus
and
which
can
be
misinterpreted
by
u.n.
agencies
azar
said
the
remarks
came
at
a
u.n.
summit
focused
largely
on
climate
change
and
health
care
azar
was
joined
by
representatives
from
countries
including
brazil
poland
and
iraq
in
making
the
statement
which
was
signed
by
a
total
of
countries
including
the
united
states
there
is
no
international
right
to
an
abortion
and
these
terms
should
not
be
used
to
promote
pro-abortion
policies
and
measures
azar
added
further
we
only
support
sex
education
that
appreciates
the
protective
role
of
the
family
in
this
education
the
comments
follow
a
letter
issued
in
july
by
azar
and
u.s.
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
expressing
similar
concerns
and
asking
foreign
leaders
to
join
the
united
states
in
ensuring
that
every
sovereign
state
has
the
ability
to
determine
the
best
way
to
protect
the
unborn
and
defend
the
family
as
the
foundational
unit
of
society
vital
to
children
thriving
and
leading
healthy
lives
conservative
groups
are
praising
the
statement
saying
the
u.s.
should
focus
on
what
they
describe
as
less
divisive
issues
such
as
maternal
mortality
the
conversation
really
needs
to
get
back
to
basics
said
susan
yoshihara
research
director
at
the
center
for
family
and
human
rights
a
faith-based
conservative
think
tank
in
an
interview
with
npr
we're
very
pleased
that
the
united
states
and
these
countries
are
refocusing
universal
health
coverage
on
the
real
needs
of
women
and
children
yoshihara
noted
that
azar's
statement
comes
after
decades
of
debate
surrounding
how
the
united
nations
should
address
issues
related
to
abortion
contraception
and
sexuality
grace
melton
who
represents
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
at
the
u.n.
said
conservative
groups
believe
terms
like
sexual
and
reproductive
health
are
being
used
to
promote
abortion
and
who
knows
what
else
at
the
united
nations
the
concern
for
a
vast
number
of
countries
is
that
it
has
been
used
to
promote
abortion
and
that's
not
what
they
want
melton
said
meanwhile
reproductive
rights
groups
are
calling
for
expanded
access
to
abortion
and
contraception
around
the
globe
shannon
kowalski
director
of
advocacy
and
policy
at
the
international
women's
health
coalition
was
in
new
york
for
the
meeting
she
said
dozens
of
other
countries
have
signed
on
to
a
competing
statement
calling
for
international
investment
in
sexual
and
reproductive
health
care
the
u.n.
press
office
says
it
has
not
received
that
statement
but
the
netherlands
minister
of
foreign
trade
sigrid
kaag
tweeted
and
spoke
in
support
of
sexual
and
reproductive
health
care
on
behalf
of
several
countries
the
united
states
is
isolated
their
position
is
extreme
kowalski
of
iwhc
said
in
an
interview
with
npr
they
read
their
statement
in
conjunction
with
countries
like
russia
saudi
arabia
and
bahrain
which
are
hardly
champions
of
women's
rights
and
if
they're
the
countries
that
the
u.s.
is
aligning
themselves
with
then
i
think
we're
right
to
dismiss
that
they
have
any
moral
stake
in
this
battle
caitlin
horrigan
director
of
advocacy
at
planned
parenthood
global
released
a
statement
saying
in
part
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
the
trump-pence
administration
is
lobbying
other
countries
to
join
them
in
working
to
undermine
sexual
and
reproductive
rights
on
a
global
scale
at
the
united
nations
from
day
one
the
trump-pence
administration
has
tried
to
take
away
access
to
birth
control
and
safe
legal
abortion
horrigan
noted
that
one
of
trump's
early
acts
after
his
inauguration
in
was
to
reinstate
what's
known
as
the
mexico
city
policy
which
prohibits
u.s.
federal
dollars
from
going
to
organizations
that
provide
or
promote
abortions
overseas
the
administration
has
taken
similar
steps
domestically
issuing
new
rules
earlier
this
year
barring
federal
family
planning
funds
from
being
granted
to
organizations
that
provide
or
refer
patients
for
abortion
