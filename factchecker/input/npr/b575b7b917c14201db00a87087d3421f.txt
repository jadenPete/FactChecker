updated

google
and
its

subsidiary
will
pay
million
to
settle
allegations
that
youtube
collected
personal
information
from
children
without
their
parents
consent
the
federal
trade
commission
said
wednesday
the
companies
allegedly
collected
information
of
children
viewing
videos
on
youtube
by
tracking
users
of
channels
that
are
directed
at
kids
youtube
allegedly
failed
to
notify
parents
or
get
their
consent
violating
laws
that
protect
children's
privacy
according
to
a
complaint
filed
against
the
companies
by
the
ftc
and
the
new
york
attorney
general
youtube
earned
millions
of
dollars
by
then
using
this
information
to
target
ads
to
the
children
according
to
the
complaint
youtube
touted
its
popularity
with
children
to
prospective
corporate
clients
ftc
chairman
joe
simons
said
in
a
statement
yet
when
it
came
to
complying
with
the
children
privacy
law
the
company
refused
to
acknowledge
that
portions
of
its
platform
were
clearly
directed
to
kids
there's
no
excuse
for
youtube's
violations
of
the
law
according
to
the
complaint
youtube
marketed
itself
as
a
top
destination
for
kids
in
presentations
to
the
makers
of
popular
children's
products
and
brands
for
example
google
and
youtube
told
mattel
maker
of
barbie
and
monster
high
toys
that
youtube
is
today's
leader
in
reaching
children
age
against
top
tv
channels
and
told
hasbro
which
makes
my
little
pony
and
play-doh
that
youtube
is
the
website
regularly
visited
by
kids
the
ftc
voted
to
authorize
the
complaint
and
the
final
order
in
the
case
in
his
dissent
ftc
commissioner
rohit
chopra
said
google
baited
children
using
nursery
rhymes
cartoons
and
other
kid-directed
content
on
curated
youtube
channels
to
feed
its
massively
profitable
behavioral
advertising
business
he
noted
that
the
terms
of
the
settlement
were
not
even
significant
enough
to
make
google
issue
a
warning
to
its
investors
chopra
said
he
fears
the
commission
brings
down
the
hammer
on
small
firms
while
allowing
large
firms
to
get
off
easier
the
complaint
said
the
companies
practices
violated
the
children's
online
privacy
protection
rule
known
as
coppa
under
a
law
under
the
settlement
google
and
youtube
will
pay
million
to
the
ftc
and
million
to
the
state
of
new
york
the
campaign
for
a
commercial-free
childhood
was
among
several
groups
that
had
asked
the
ftc
to
investigate
whether
google
and
youtube
violated
the
children's
privacy
law
ccfc
executive
director
josh
golin
said
in
a
statement
that
the
group
was
pleased
there
will
be
considerably
less
behavioral
advertising
targeted
to
children
on
the
number
one
kids
site
in
the
world
but
he
added
that
it's
extremely
disappointing
that
the
ftc
isn't
requiring
more
substantive
changes
or
doing
more
to
hold
google
accountable
for
harming
children
through
years
of
illegal
data
collection
a
google
spokeswoman
referred
npr
to
an
official
youtube
blog
post
in
that
post
youtube
said
responsibility
is
our
number
one
priority
at
youtube
and
nothing
is
more
important
than
protecting
kids
and
their
privacy
youtube
said
that
in
about
four
months
it
will
begin
treating
data
from
anyone
watching
children's
content
on
youtube
as
coming
from
a
child
regardless
of
the
age
of
the
user
and
will
stop
serving
personalized
ads
on
this
content
and
end
comments
and
notifications
on
it
people
or
companies
that
post
content
on
youtube
will
be
required
to
tell
youtube
if
their
videos
represent
children's
content
youtube
said
in
order
to
identify
content
made
for
kids
creators
will
be
required
to
tell
us
when
their
content
falls
in
this
category
and
we'll
also
use
machine
learning
to
find
videos
that
clearly
target
young
audiences
for
example
those
that
have
an
emphasis
on
kids
characters
themes
toys
or
games
youtube
said
the
company
said
the
change
will
have
a
significant
business
impact
on
creators
of
family
and
children's
content
and
that
youtube
will
help
them
in
the
transition
youtube
said
it
will
set
up
a
million
fund
dedicated
to
the
creation
of
thoughtful
original
children's
content
on
youtube
and
youtube
kids
globally
in
a
separate
statement
simons
and
ftc
commissioner
christine
wilson
said
the
settlement
will
require
google
and
youtube
to
create
a
system
through
which
content
creators
must
self-designate
if
they
are
child-directed
this
obligation
exceeds
what
any
third
party
in
the
marketplace
currently
is
required
to
do
editor's
note
google
and
youtube
are
among
npr's
sponsors
