tents
at

for
migrants
in
el
paso
earlier
this
year
under
president
trump
the
department
of
homeland
security
focus
has
shifted
increasingly
towards
immigration
and
border
enforcement
the
trump
administration's
decision
to
shift
more
than
million
of
federal
disaster
aid
to
help
pay
for
more
detention
beds
for
migrants
has
set
off
an
outcry
just
as
florida
is
bracing
for
hurricane
dorian
but
the
move
which
also
includes
transferring
money
away
from
other
department
priorities
is
also
raising
uncomfortable
questions
about
whether
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
overly
focused
on
border
and
immigration
enforcement
at
the
expense
of
other
parts
of
its
mission
potentially
leaving
the
united
states
vulnerable
to
other
threats
david
lapan
a
former
trump
official
and
press
secretary
at
the
department
homeland
security
said
prioritizing
border
security
above
other
important
aspects
of
the
department
sends
a
clear
message
to
the
country
and
the
dhs
workforce
about
what's
really
important
and
what's
not
this
is
where
you
get
to
the
point
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
which
has
all
of
these
various
missions
to
secure
the
homeland
has
turned
into
under
president
trump
the
department
of
border
enforcement
or
the
department
of
immigration
enforcement
if
you
will
lapan
said
in
total
dhs
told
congress
that
it
plans
to
re-allocate
million
to
to
fund
more
detention
beds
for
migrants
who
were
caught
after
crossing
the
border
illegally
in
addition
to
shifting
money
from
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
disaster
relief
fund
the
trump
administration
is
transferring
another
million
away
from
the
u.s.
coast
guard
million
from
the
transportation
security
administration
and
more
than
million
from
the
newly-established
cybersecurity
and
infrastructure
security
agency
in
the
run-up
to
the
dhs
is
working
hand-in-hand
with
state
election
officials
to
prevent
cyber-attacks
like
those
that
plagued
the
elections
lapan
says
the
redirected
funds
may
not
directly
affect
federal
election
security
efforts
but
given
the
nature
of
the
threat
to
the
u.s.
from
russia
and
other
actors
lapan
said
he'd
expect
the
administration
would
want
to
strengthen
its
capabilities
in
this
area
rather
than
take
away
from
them
speaking
on
background
a
senior
dhs
official
said
the
border
is
the
department's
unquestioned
priority
and
the
administration
must
be
able
to
shift
resources
to
address
the
emergency
there
but
he
said
no
money
is
being
taken
from
election
security
efforts
or
other
critical
matters
dhs
is
intensely
focused
on
our
election
security
efforts
and
acting
secretary
mcaleenan
is
committed
to
ensuring
cisa
has
adequate
funding
to
execute
this
mission
the
dhs
official
said
none
of
the
funds
transferred
were
designated
election
security
operations
any
election
security
efforts
have
not
and
will
not
be
affected
by
any
transfer
of
funds
deputy
white
house
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
said
the
trump
administration
has
done
more
to
coordinate
efforts
between
the
federal
state
and
local
governments
than
any
previous
administration
while
the
russian
efforts
were
small
and
didn't
affect
the
outcome
of
the
elections
but
what
it
did
do
was
it
prompted
our
administration
to
put
real
measures
in
place
to
secure
the
integrity
of
our
elections
gidley
said
original
focus
on
terrorism
when
the
department
of
homeland
security
was
created
after
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
it
was
to
help
coordinate
the
many
different
agencies
that
work
to
protect
the
united
states
then-president
bush
said
the
new
department
would
help
the
united
states
defend
itself
against
the
dangers
of
a
new
kind
of
war
against
terrorism
today
we
are
taking
historic
action
to
defend
the
united
states
and
protect
our
citizens
against
the
dangers
of
a
new
era
bush
said
with
my
signature
this
act
of
congress
will
create
a
new
department
of
homeland
security
ensuring
that
our
efforts
to
defend
this
country
are
comprehensive
and
united
but
there
has
been
a
long
debate
about
whether
it
was
right
to
bring
together
so
many
agencies
with
different
missions
and
lapan
and
others
say
binding
them
together
in
one
larger
department
has
also
made
it
easier
for
trump
to
shift
money
toward
his
signature
issue
immigration
trump
signaled
that
shift
this
spring
when
he
shook
up
leadership
at
the
department
he
pushed
out
secretary
kirstjen
nielsen
and
pulled
the
nomination
of
ron
vitiello
to
lead
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
we're
going
in
a
tougher
direction
trump
said
in
april
we
want
to
go
in
a
tougher
direction
the
trump
administration
claims
the
surge
of
migrants
crossing
the
border
illegally
this
year
has
overwhelmed
resources
and
that
they
need
the
money
to
address
the
lack
of
detention
space
for
the
increasing
number
of
detainees
particularly
single
adults
congress
has
given
the
president
the
authority
to
decide
how
best
to
move
around
certain
resources
within
the
dhs
budget
said
jessica
vaughan
director
of
policy
studies
for
the
center
for
immigration
studies
which
lobbies
for
stricter
immigration
laws
further
times
have
changed
since
said
vaughan
and
the
united
states
faces
different
challenges
today
than
it
did
then
none
of
these
organizations
are
set
in
stone
because
the
federal
government
needs
to
be
able
to
respond
to
challenges
that
change
over
time
she
said
there
is
no
question
that
border
enforcement
is
an
essential
priority
said
juliette
kayyem
a
former
assistant
secretary
at
dhs
during
the
obama
administration
but
she
said
a
single-minded
focus
on
just
one
security
challenge
means
ignoring
other
vulnerabilities
she
said
the
government
learned
that
lesson
after
just
a
few
years
of
focusing
on
terrorism
when
hurricane
katrina
hit
the
u.s.
gulf
coast
in
the
apparatus
realized
that
if
you
focus
solely
on
stopping
guys
from
getting
on
four
airplanes
again
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
save
an
american
city
from
drowning
