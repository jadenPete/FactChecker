updated

a
move
that
puts
california
on
a
collision
course
with
the
ncaa
gov
gavin
newsom
has
signed
a
bill
effectively
allowing
college
athletes
in
the
state
to
earn
compensation
for
the
use
of
their
likeness
sign
endorsement
deals
and
hire
agents
to
represent
them
the
governor
signed
the
measure
in
a
segment
released
monday
by
uninterrupted
a
sports
programming
company
co-founded
by
lebron
james
newsom
proclaimed
the
move
as
the
beginning
of
a
national
movement
one
that
transcends
geographic
and
partisan
lines
collegiate
student
athletes
put
everything
on
the
line
their
physical
health
future
career
prospects
and
years
of
their
lives
to
compete
colleges
reap
billions
from
these
student
athletes
sacrifices
and
success
but
in
the
same
breath
block
them
from
earning
a
single
dollar
he
said
in
a
statement
that's
a
bankrupt
model
one
that
puts
institutions
ahead
of
the
students
they
are
supposed
to
serve
it
needs
to
be
disrupted
california
is
the
first
state
to
pass
such
a
law
which
is
to
take
effect
on
jan
that
marks
a
significant
shift
from
the
current
policies
enforced
by
the
ncaa
collegiate
sports
national
governing
body
which
generally
renders
student-athletes
ineligible
to
accept
compensation
for
the
use
of
his
or
her
name
or
picture
to
advertise
recommend
or
promote
directly
the
sale
or
use
of
a
commercial
product
or
service
of
any
kind
and
the
ncaa
board
of
governors
pushed
back
hard
against
the
bill
at
the
time
of
its
passage
in
the
legislature
saying
that
it
would
leave
the
playing
field
for
universities
of
different
sizes
radically
uneven
right
now
nearly
half
a
million
student-athletes
in
all
states
compete
under
the
same
rules
the
member
panel
composed
mostly
of
university
presidents
and
athletic
directors
said
in
a
letter
to
newsom
on
sept
this
bill
would
remove
that
essential
element
of
fairness
and
equal
treatment
that
forms
the
bedrock
of
college
sports
on
monday
shortly
after
newsom's
announcement
the
ncaa
released
another
slightly
more
conciliatory
statement
one
acknowledging
that
changes
are
needed
to
continue
to
support
student-athletes
but
also
warning
that
this
new
law
already
is
creating
confusion
for
current
and
future
student-athletes
coaches
administrators
and
campuses
and
not
just
in
california
we
will
consider
next
steps
in
california
the
group
added
while
our
members
move
forward
with
ongoing
efforts
to
make
adjustments
to
ncaa
name
image
and
likeness
rules
that
are
both
realistic
in
modern
society
and
tied
to
higher
education
the
financial
stakes
of
the
dispute
are
massive
between
tv
rights
marketing
fees
and
other
avenues
particularly
for
its
major
cash
cow
the
ncaa
division
i
men's
basketball
tournament
the
organization
has
reported
annual
revenues
cresting
billion
the
ncaa
maintains
that
it
converts
much
of
that
intake
into
crucial
opportunities
for
student-athletes
saying
it
has
provided
billions
of
dollars
in
scholarships
and
the
opportunity
for
millions
across
sports
to
earn
undergraduate
and
graduate
degrees
that
hasn't
silenced
critics
who
have
grown
louder
in
recent
years
amid
a
recent
spate
of
high-profile
investigations
including
efforts
by
the
fbi
looking
into
alleged
corrupt
recruiting
practices
in
ncaa
men's
basketball
the
hefty
punishments
levied
against
schools
and
players
by
the
national
governing
body
has
focused
a
spotlight
on
why
the
competitors
featured
in
such
a
lucrative
industry
are
left
out
of
its
profits
michael
sokolove
who
wrote
of
the
massive
scandal
at
the
university
of
louisville's
basketball
program
in
the
last
temptation
of
rick
pitino
talked
to
fresh
air
last
year
about
one
notable
discrepancy
if
you
look
at
a
program
like
louisville
which
is
a
program
that
i
focused
on
they
generate
about
million
a
year
in
revenue
they
give
out
scholarships
that
adds
up
to
about
a
year
the
rest
of
it
gets
spread
out
to
the
coach
who
makes
million
a
year
to
the
assistant
coaches
who
make
as
much
as
a
half-million
dollars
a
year
sokolove
said
all
throughout
the
athletic
department
people
are
making
six-figure
salaries
it
does
not
go
to
the
players
what
i
call
the
unpaid
workforce
pushback
also
has
come
from
a
number
of
prominent
athletes
including
james
who
opted
to
skip
college
basketball
entirely
to
head
straight
to
the
nba
before
the
pro
league
implemented
a
minimum
age
requirement
in
barring
others
from
following
james
path
part
of
the
reason
i
went
to
the
nba
is
to
get
my
mom
out
of
the
situation
that
she
was
in
james
said
in
the
informal
signing
ceremony
with
newsom
that
was
held
on
a
barbershop
set
i
couldn't
have
done
that
if
i
would
have
stepped
on
a
college
campus
others
such
as
nfl
cornerback
richard
sherman
have
rejected
the
notion
put
forward
by
the
ncaa
and
others
that
a
free
college
education
is
recompense
enough
for
the
amount
of
work
these
athletes
put
in
sherman
told
sports
illustrated
in
that
he
would
love
for
a
regular
student
to
have
a
student-athlete's
schedule
during
the
season
for
just
one
quarter
or
one
semester
and
show
me
how
you
balance
that
people
think
oh
you're
on
scholarship
they
pay
for
your
room
and
board
they
pay
for
your
education
but
to
their
knowledge
you're
there
to
play
football
said
sherman
who
got
his
degree
from
stanford
university
you're
not
on
scholarship
for
school
and
it
sounds
crazy
when
a
student-athlete
says
that
but
those
are
the
things
coaches
tell
them
every
day
you're
not
on
scholarship
for
school
