meeting
united
nations

during
the
th
session
of
the
general
assembly
on
thursday
in
new
york
the
last
thing
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
did
before
flying
to
new
york
this
week
was
sign
his
country's
first
law
on
presidential
impeachment
it
was
an
irony
of
fate
that
by
the
time
he
returned
from
his
first
official
visit
to
the
united
states
it
was
president
trump
who
was
facing
an
impeachment
inquiry
based
on
a
phone
call
he
had
made
to
zelenskiy
two
months
earlier
the
political
upheaval
that
july
conversation
set
off
in
washington
has
thrust
ukraine
into
the
limelight
ever
since
its
independence
from
the
soviet
union
in
the
country's
biggest
problem
has
been
asserting
itself
as
a
nation
with
its
own
will
and
destiny
nobody
can
pressure
me
because
i'm
the
president
of
an
independent
country
zelenskiy
declared
to
reporters
from
russian
state
tv
before
meeting
with
trump
on
wednesday
only
one
person
can
pressure
me
and
that's
my
year-old
son
zelenskiy
a
professional
comedian
won
a
landslide
election
last
spring
on
a
wave
of
popular
frustration
with
poverty
corruption
and
a
russian-backed
insurgency
in
eastern
ukraine
that
has
killed
people
now
zelenskiy
faces
the
additional
task
of
navigating
a
political
minefield
in
the
united
states
the
one
country
that
many
ukrainians
consider
capable
of
safeguarding
their
independence
yet
the
upstart
ukrainian
president
is
not
the
only
unlikely
protagonist
in
a
tangled
tale
that
now
threatens
the
trump
presidency
the
cast
of
characters
includes
rudy
giuliani
trump's
personal
lawyer
two
former
ukrainian
prosecutors
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
hunter
who
worked
for
a
ukrainian
oil
company
for
five
years
without
hunter
biden
there
would
be
no
story
here
because
hunter
biden
looks
like
he
was
trying
to
cash
in
and
got
himself
a
nice
lucrative
contract
on
the
board
of
directors
of
burisma
an
energy
company
run
by
a
former
ecology
minister
says
brian
bonner
editor
of
the
kyiv
post
newspaper
in
ukraine's
capital
hunter
biden's
role
there
was
flagged
as
a
big
conflict
of
interest
for
the
vice
president
at
the
time
it
should
have
never
happened
hunter
biden
joined
burisma's
board
in
spring
as
ukraine
was
still
reeling
from
bloody
street
protests
in
kyiv
and
the
annexation
of
crimea
by
russian
troops
ukraine's
president
viktor
yanukovych
had
fled
to
russia
and
a
provisional
pro-western
government
was
struggling
to
put
down
a
kremlin-backed
uprising
in
eastern
ukraine
in
all
that
turmoil
the
obama
administration's
point
man
on
ukraine
was
joe
biden
at
the
time
members
of
yanukovych's
ruling
clique
were
on
the
run
including
burisma's
owner
a
former
environment
minister
who
had
been
responsible
for
issuing
drilling
licenses
in
britain
the
company
was
being
investigated
for
money
laundering
and
ukraine's
new
government
pledged
to
uncover
yanukovych-era
corruption
including
at
burisma
high-profile
foreigners
like
hunter
biden
and
aleksander
kwasniewski
a
former
polish
president
were
hired
to
help
burnish
the
company's
reputation
says
daria
kaleniuk

head
of
kyiv's
anti-corruption

advocacy

from
this
story
i
haven't
seen
any
evidence
of
hunter
biden
doing
something
illegal
in
ukraine
she
says
but
taking
the
job
in
the
first
place
kaleniuk
adds
was
unethical
for
sure
the
question
of
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
has
fueled
giuliani's
accusation
that
joe
biden
used
his
position
to
pressure
ukraine
to
fire
its
prosecutor
general
viktor
shokin
who
oversaw
the
investigation
into
burisma
but
kaleniuk
says
it
was
precisely
shokin's
inaction
on
cases
such
as
burisma
that
caused
ukrainian
activists
together
with
the
u.s.
and
european
governments
to
call
for
his
resignation
there
were
lots
of
demands
from
different
international
stakeholders
to
fire
shokin
because
of
his
failure
at
managing
to
reform
and
changing
the
soviet-style
prosecutor's
office
says
andrii
borovyk
head
of
the
kyiv
office
of
global
corruption
watchdog
transparency
international
shokin's
replacement
as
ukraine's
prosecutor
general
was
yuriy
lutsenko
who
critics
say
also
failed
to
win
any
high-level
corruption
convictions
but
lutsenko
did
distinguish
himself
by
reaching
out
to
giuliani
earlier
this
year
with
the
suggestion
that
the
bidens
might
have
something
to
hide
in
ukraine
in
the
spring
zelenskiy
was
rising
in
election
polls
against
incumbent
petro
poroshenko
and
lutsenko
faced
the
prospect
of
losing
his
job
under
a
new
president
ivan
yakovina
a
kyiv-based
political
commentator
says
outreach
to
the
trump
administration
was
one
way
for
lutsenko
to
secure
his
position
in
the
future
giuliani
thought
lutsenko
would
play
for
trump's
team
but
lutsenko
was
playing
for
his
own
team
says
yakovina
if
trump
ends
up
getting
impeached
he
can
blame
lutsenko
for
wanting
to
stay
in
power
lutsenko
didn't
end
up
keeping
his
job
and
zelenskiy
appointed
a
new
prosecutor
general
in
august
zelenskiy
is
in
a
tough
position
because
he
cannot
afford
to
get
involved
in
partisan
politics
in
america
says
kyiv
post
editor
bonner
the
one
thing
ukraine
has
had
going
for
it
in
america
is
strong
bipartisan
support
and
delving
into
a
political
partisan
campaign
would
threaten
to
erode
that
anti-corruption
campaigner
kaleniuk
says
that
ukraine's
hard-fought
independence
may
be
at
stake
both
ukraine
and
the
united
states
are
losing
it's
only
russia
which
is
really
benefiting
from
this
story
she
says
if
ukraine
loses
bipartisan
support
in
the
united
states
russia
will
win
the
battle
for
ukraine
political
analyst
yakovina
takes
a
much
more
sanguine
view
even
though
zelenskiy
may
have
appeared
excessively
deferential
in
the
july
call
yakovina
says
the
ukrainian
president
is
not
without
his
own
trump
card
in
the
lopsided
relationship
with
the
united
states
after
all
zelenskiy
also
has
a
record
of
his
conversation
with
trump
and
he
hasn't
released
his
version
of
it
yet
