speaks
during
a

at

on

trump
administration
officials
announced
new
rules
that
aim
to
deny
permanent
residency
to
migrants
who
may
need
to
use
food
stamps
medicaid
and
other
public
benefits
the
trump
administration
is
moving
forward
with
regulations
that
are
expected
to
dramatically
reshape
the
u.s.
immigration
system
by
denying
green
cards
and
visas
to
immigrants
who
use
or
are
expected
to
use
a
wide
range
of
federal
state
and
local
government
benefits
including
food
stamps
housing
vouchers
and
medicaid
the
final
version
of
the
public
charge
rule
which
has
been
a
top
priority
for
immigration
hard-liners
in
the
white
house
is
set
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
on
wednesday
ken
cuccinelli
the
acting
director
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
announced
the
move
monday
morning
he
said
the
purpose
is
to
clarify
existing
law
which
is
designed
to
ensure
that
immigrants
do
not
become
dependent
on
the
government
through
the
public
charge
rule
president
trump's
administration
is
reenforcing
the
ideal
of
self-sufficiency
and
personal
responsibility
ensuring
that
immigrants
are
able
to
support
themselves
and
become
successful
in
america
he
said
the
rule
is
set
to
take
effect
in
days
but
is
expected
to
draw
legal
challenges
from
immigrant-rights
groups
and
others
a
cruel
new
step
a
preliminary
draft
published
last
year
drew
more
than
comments
many
of
the
comments
expressed
outrage
that
the
administration
would
penalize
immigrants
for
using
benefits
that
they
are
legally
entitled
to
receive
the
change
is
seen
as
part
of
a
broader
administration
effort
to
limit
both
immigration
and
the
overall
use
of
public
benefits
immigrant
advocates
immediately
denounced
the
final
rule
which
they
say
could
hurt
millions
of
immigrants
already
living
in
the
u.s.
as
well
as
their
citizen
children
they
say
it
could
also
sharply
curtail
legal
immigration
especially
when
coupled
with
tough
new
state
department
standards
that
take
the
likelihood
of
an
immigrant's
use
of
public
benefits
into
account
when
granting
visas
this
news
is
a
cruel
new
step
toward
weaponizing
programs
that
are
intended
to
help
people
by
making
them
instead
a
means
of
separating
families
and
sending
immigrants
and
communities
of
color
one
message
you
are
not
welcome
here
said
marielena
hincapi
executive
director
of
the
national
immigration
law
center
which
announced
that
it
intends
to
file
a
legal
challenge
against
the
new
rule
cuccinelli
says
the
administration
is
merely
trying
to
enforce
a
long-standing
goal
of
u.s.
immigration
law
which
is
to
prevent
individuals
from
becoming
a
public
charge
but
in
recent
decades
the
government
has
interpreted
the
public
charge
requirement
to
mean
that
immigrants
are
not
likely
to
depend
on
cash
welfare
programs
which
most
immigrants
are
barred
from
receiving
anyway
the
new
regulations
greatly
expand
the
definition
of
public
charge
to
include
noncash
benefits
as
well
such
as
nutrition
assistance
housing
vouchers
and
subsidized
medical
insurance
cuccinelli
notes
that
there
will
be
a
number
of
exceptions
including
certain
benefit
use
by
refugees
and
asylum-seekers
military
members
and
children
and
pregnant
women
under
the
rule
green
card
and
visa
applicants
can
be
denied
not
merely
for
being
primarily
dependent
on
the
government
for
subsistence
as
in
the
past
but
if
they
are
likely
to
need
public
assistance
at
any
time
the
regulations
also
add
new
requirements
for
income
and
financial
assets
advocates
say
that
will
make
it
difficult
for
immigrants
earning
less
than
percent
of
the
federal
poverty
guidelines
more
than
for
a
family
of
four
to
get
green
cards
although
the
administration
argues
that
the
limit
is
closer
to
percent
of
poverty
a
chilling
effect
the
new
rule
would
apply
not
retroactively
but
to
future
applicants
for
green
cards
and
visas
past
use
of
most
benefits
would
not
be
held
against
the
applicant
and
neither
would
the
use
of
such
benefits
by
dependents
and
other
family
members
still
public
health
and
social
service
providers
say
they
have
already
seen
a
chilling
effect
among
immigrants
who
are
afraid
to
get
government
aid
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
their
u.s.
citizen
children
for
fear
it
could
be
held
against
them
the
impact
was
felt
as
soon
as
rumors
began
to
spread
early
in
the
trump
administration
that
the
rule
change
was
under
consideration
the
urban
institute
reported
recently
that
in
of
adults
in
immigrant
families
say
that
they
or
a
family
member
did
not
participate
in
a
benefit
program
last
year
out
of
fear
of
risking
future
green
card
status
opposition
is
expected
to
be
widespread
a
group
of
state
attorneys
general
sent
a
letter
to
the
office
of
management
and
budget
last
month
arguing
that
dhs
had
entirely
failed
to
estimate
the
true
costs
of
the
regulation
the
proposed
rules
would
cause
extensive
injury
to
our
states
economies
and
to
millions
of
our
states
residents
washington
ag
bob
ferguson
wrote
if
implemented
as
proposed
the
rules
will
result
in
a
reduction
of
total
economic
output
a
drop
in
workers
wages
and
elimination
of
jobs
in
our
states
businesses
such
as
the
home
care
industry
are
also
expected
to
be
affected
an
estimated
to
of
the
nation's
million
home
care
workers
are
recent
immigrants
the
average
wage
is
about
an
hour
which
makes
many
of
them
eligible
for
public
assistance
william
dombi
president
of
the
national
association
for
home
care
and
hospice
says
there
is
already
a
shortage
of
home
care
workers
and
the
new
rule
will
only
exacerbate
the
problem
this
is
very
hard
work
and
it's
very
poorly
paid
he
says
dombi
says
the
irony
is
that
many
home
care
workers
need
public
assistance
because
their
low
pay
rates
are
set
by
the
government
program
medicaid
that
funds
many
of
the
services
they
provide
the
fact
that
the
workers
may
be
earning
to
a
year
is
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
medicaid
is
not
paying
enough
for
them
to
have
a
living
wage
he
says
