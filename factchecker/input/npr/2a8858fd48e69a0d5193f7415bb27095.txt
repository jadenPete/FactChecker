foreign
interference
continues
to
threaten
u.s.
elections
in
many
forms
including
the
active
spreading
of
disinformation
foreign
interference
didn't
begin
in
it
didn't
end
with
that
election
and
u.s.
officials
expect
it
to
remain
an
issue
through
the
elections
as
well
here's
what
you
need
to
know
governments
always
have
sought
to
shape
political
and
other
conditions
around
the
world
to
their
own
benefit
most
recently
foreign
governments
have
used
cyberattacks
and
agitation
on
social
media
to
influence
the
information
environment
in
the
united
states
and
europe
for
americans
the
best-known
case
is
that
of
russia
in
which
sought
to
keep
hillary
clinton
from
being
elected
and
to
help
donald
trump
win
other
governments
also
have
been
detected
in
clandestine
attempts
to
influence
opinion
in
the
u.s.
including
those
of
iran
and
china
several
ways
cyberattacks
in
russian
intelligence
officers
launched
a
wave
of
cyberattacks
against
a
number
of
political
targets
inside
the
united
states
they
stole
huge
amounts
of
data
they
knew
would
embarrass
those
involved
and
released
it
via
wikileaks
and
other
ways
meanwhile
other
cyberattacks
targeted
state
election
infrastructure
around
the
u.s.
including
the
state-level
governments
and
their
vendors
responsible
for
conducting
elections
although
there
were
a
number
of
compromises
of
various
kinds
u.s.
officials
do
not
believe
anyone's
vote
was
changed
that
is
no
one
who
cast
a
ballot
for
clinton
they
say
had
it
later
changed
electronically
to
one
for
trump
but
revelations
about
this
keep
trickling
out
and
they
have
sparked
a
national
conversation
about
confidence
in
elections
social
media
agitation
another
ongoing
strain
of
interference
involves
agitation
on
social
networks
whipped
up
by
specialists
who
pose
as
american
users
on
facebook
twitter
and
other
platforms
in
this
work
crossed
over
from
the
digital
realm
into
the
real
world
many
times
including
when
russian
influence
specialists
for
example
scheduled
pro-
and
anti-muslim
rallies
for
the
same
place
and
time
directly
across
from
each
other
the
office
of
former
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
identified
what
it
called
dozens
of
such
rallies
around
the
united
states
starting
in
november
of
and
continuing
after
election
day
social
media
agitation
continues
by
russia
and
other
foreign
powers
on
big
social
network
platforms
facebook
and
twitter
for
example
have
said
since
the
election
that
they've
continued
purging
bots
and
fake
accounts
linked
to
attempts
to
influence
americans
other
techniques
there
may
be
other
types
of
influence
that
aren't
publicly
known
there
also
are
overt
avenues
by
which
foreign
governments
spread
their
messages
including
state-controlled
tv
radio
and
online
outlets
these
don't
only
have
to
originate
in
their
home
countries
the
russian
and
chinese
governments
for
example
sponsor
broadcasts
on
radio
networks
that
can
reach
many
americans
inside
the
united
states
so
foreign
interference
is
mostly
about
information
or
disinformation
so
far
yes
the
worry
expressed
by
u.s.
officials
and
outside
experts
is
that
weak
cybersecurity
somewhere
could
open
up
the
workings
of
an
election
to
further
mischief
imagine
precinct
officials
on
election
day
losing
access
to
their
voter
rolls
or
in
places
where
there
is
no
paper
record
of
a
person's
vote
a
ballot
actually
being
changed
after
the
fact
from
candidate
x
to
candidate
y.
federal
officials
say
the
disparate
variety
of
systems
and
procedures
across
the
country
mean
that
a
u.s.
election
as
a
whole
is
almost
impossible
to
hack
but
an
adversary
doesn't
need
to
affect
the
whole
country
all
it
needs
to
do
is
affect
small
numbers
of
people
in
key
places
the
election
is
expected
to
turn
on
three
or
four
key
swing
states
plus
the
discovery
of
that
interference
anywhere
could
have
a
corrosive
effect
on
americans
faith
in
their
elections
everywhere
what
is
the
government
doing
to
safeguard
elections
president
trump
goes
back
and
forth
about
what
he
accepts
about
foreign
interference
and
how
seriously
he
treats
the
issue
sometimes
he
scoffs
sometimes
he
vows
that
interference
will
be
counteracted
very
strongly
leaders
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
and
law
enforcement
say
they're
working
on
making
sure
that
elections
are
secure
the
fbi
has
vowed
to
call
out
interference
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
extending
help
to
state
and
other
elections
officials
u.s.
intelligence
and
military
agencies
also
are
reportedly
doing
more
work
behind
the
scenes
congress
has
provided
more
funding
for
election
systems
upgrades
but
there
are
some
jurisdictions
that
don't
have
paper
backups
for
voters
ballots
at
the
same
time
members
of
congress
haven't
been
able
to
agree
on
legislation
proposed
since
based
on
the
discoveries
about
what
took
place
then
proposals
have
included
mandating
more
reporting
about
political
spending
on
social
media
requiring
paper
ballot
backups
everywhere
and
requiring
that
campaigns
report
contacts
with
foreigners
to
the
fbi
members
of
congress
are
likely
to
continue
debating
these
and
other
proposal
through
the
election
but
they
don't
appear
on
track
to
become
law
by
election
day
will
be
a
repeat
of
probably
not
for
one
thing
americans
are
on
their
guard
about
foreign
interference
in
a
way
they
weren't
before
for
another
the
tactics
and
techniques
are
evolving
although
cyberattacks
and
social
media
agitation
may
return
security
officials
new
concerns
involve
high-quality
fake
video
or
audio
which
didn't
play
a
big
role
in
the
stories
from
earlier
elections
there's
also
no
way
to
know
in
advance
whether
the
russian
government
in
particular
which
wanted
to
put
trump
into
office
because
it
liked
his
support
for
an
improved
relationship
would
continue
to
support
him
for
a
second
term
in
the
same
way
