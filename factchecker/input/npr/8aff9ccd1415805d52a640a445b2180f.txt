vice
president
for
external
affairs
with
oil
search
a
papua
new
guinea-based
company
that
first
expanded
into
alaska
in
this
was
not
an
easy
decision
but
i
am
excited
to
be
coming
home
with
a
company
that
is
doing
great
things
he
wrote
in
a
facebook
post
balash
said
he
considers
oil
search's
project
a
key
piece
of
alaska's
economic
and
fiscal
future
in
a
statement
oil
search
said
balash
brings
significant
regulatory
and
external
affairs
experience
noting
that
it
is
a
relatively
new
player
in
the
u.s.
before
his
federal
job
balash
who
went
to
high
school
in
alaska
and
still
has
family
there
worked
as
a
special
assistant
to
sarah
palin
when
she
was
alaska's
governor
then
later
served
as
the
state's
natural
resources
commissioner
at
the
interior
department
he's
been
an
advocate
for
the
trump
administration's
strategy
of
energy
dominance
pushing
to
open
more
federal
lands
to
drilling
in
the
arctic
refuge
and
in
the
national
petroleum
reserve
alaska
oil
search
is
advancing
a
project
called
the
pikka
development
on
alaska's
north
slope
which
could
ultimately
produce
as
many
as
barrels
of
oil
a
day
boosting
the
total
amount
of
oil
extracted
in
the
state
by
about
one-fourth
the
project
is
miles
west
of
the
arctic
refuge
on
state-
and
privately-owned
land
not
federal
land
though
the
company
had
to
secure
a
federal
wetlands
permit
from
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers
balash
said
he
started
to
take
calls
from
search
firms
in
may
and
was
gob
smacked
when
the
first
one
was
from
an
exploration
and
production
company
in
alaska
he
told
alaska's
energy
desk
that
he
immediately
filed
disclosure
forms
and
sought
guidance
from
ethics
attorneys
on
any
interior
department
matters
that
might
affect
the
company
especially
regarding
the
trump
administration's
push
to
open
new
areas
to
drilling
in
alaska's
arctic
refuge
and
the
national
petroleum
reserve
in
both
cases
he
said
in
a
statement
it
was
determined
that
oil
search's
participation
in
future
lease
sales
is
speculative
balash
said
he
would
abide
by
a
trump
administration
ethics
pledge
that
for
five
years
blocks
high-level
appointees
from
lobbying
the
agency
where
they
worked
environmental
organizations
quickly
blasted
balash
for
accepting
a
job
in
the
oil
industry
throughout
his
time
at
interior
joe
balash
spearheaded
efforts
to
suppress
science
ignore
indigenous
rights
and
sell
off
the
arctic
refuge
for
drilling
at
all
costs
the
sierra
club's
lena
moffitt
said
in
a
statement
now
he's
shamelessly
seeking
to
profit
from
this
destruction
while
the
american
people
and
our
public
lands
pay
the
price
balash
is
only
the
latest
trump
administration
official
to
raise
questions
about
ties
to
the
industry
he
was
appointed
to
regulate
earlier
this
year
former
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
scott
pruitt
was
hired
by
an
indiana

against
plant
closures
there
his
replacement
