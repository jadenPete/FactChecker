updated
at
p

et
signaling
a
widening
gap
between
democratic
leadership
and
the
house
judiciary
committee
the
panel
will
vote
this
week
on
whether
to
install
new
procedures
for
its
impeachment
inquiry
and
illustrate
its
intensifying
efforts
in
the
probe
the
move
which
will
culminate
in
a
vote
before
the
committee
on
thursday
will
allow
staff
to
question
witnesses
for
extended
periods
and
let
the
panel
accept
evidence
behind
closed
doors
to
further
protect
sources
among
other
changes
it
also
shows
the
growing
divide
between
progressives
pushing
for
impeachment
and
moderate
democrats
in
the
house
and
their
leadership
which
is
largely
opposed
to
any
formal
action
now
despite
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
public
comments
supporting
the
panel's
investigation
privately
she
has
told
members
that
the
issue
is
a
loser
without
strong
public
sentiment
on
monday
pelosi
downplayed
the
move
saying
the
committee's
investigation
has
been
ongoing
for
a
very
long
time
and
expressed
support
she
also
said
other
legislation
is
a
top
priority
such
as
approving
new
gun
restrictions
we
are
legislating
we're
investigating
as
we
have
been
and
we
are
litigating
we
are
taking
our
information
to
court
pelosi
said
that's
the
path
that
we
are
on
and
that's
the
path
we'll
continue
to
be
on
pelosi
said
she
wasn't
familiar
with
comments
by
the
committee's
chairman
rep
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y
that
the
panel
was
in
the
midst
of
formal
impeachment
proceedings
however
she
said
that
the
committee
has
her
support
and
that
it
is
executing
the
party's
demands
it's
not
a
question
of
signing
off
on
what
they
have
done
it's
a
question
of
what
we
are
doing
that
they
are
implementing
and
that's
a
logical
thing
for
a
committee
to
establish
a
procedure
she
said
earlier
monday
a
pelosi
aide
also
reiterated
that
the
speaker
supported
nadler's
investigation
and
resolution
also
earlier
a
democrat
on
the
committee
said
she
was
in
support
and
defended
the
procedures
move
i
think
speaker
pelosi
respects
chairman
nadler's
work
in
the
committee
and
i
think
for
her
the
most
important
thing
is
for
us
to
have
the
strongest
hand
possible
against
this
president
and
the
american
public
to
have
the
whole
truth
florida
democratic
rep
debbie
mucarsel-powell
a
member
of
the
panel
told
cnn
on
monday
so
this
is
just
another
procedural
vote
as
we
continue
to
intensify
our
investigation
the
procedures
change
has
precedent
from
previous
impeachment
probes
and
will
more
clearly
define
where
the
committee
stands
on
its
investigation
democratic
committee
aides
said
in
a
call
with
reporters
monday
it
also
tees
up
a
busy
fall
season
for
the
panel
which
could
issue
articles
of
impeachment
by
year's
end
according
to
nadler
and
committee
aides
among
the
plans
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
is
slated
to
appear
before
the
committee
on
tuesday
sept
rob
porter
the
former
white
house
staff
secretary
and
rick
dearborn
a
former
white
house
deputy
chief
of
staff
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
same
hearing
nadler
said
in
a
statement
monday
that
trump
went
to
great
lengths
to
obstruct
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
which
resulted
in
criminal
indictments
and
seven
guilty
pleas
it
also
revealed
possible
instances
in
which
trump
obstructed
justice
nadler
said
there
are
additional
questions
of
violations
of
the
emoluments
clauses
of
the
constitution
nadler
added
no
one
is
above
the
law
the
unprecedented
corruption
coverup
and
crimes
by
the
president
are
under
investigation
by
the
committee
as
we
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
or
other
article
remedies
nadler
said
in
a
statement
the
adoption
of
these
additional
procedures
is
the
next
step
in
that
process
and
will
help
ensure
our
impeachment
hearings
are
informative
to
congress
and
the
public
while
providing
the
president
with
the
ability
to
respond
to
evidence
presented
against
him
we
will
not
allow
trump's
continued
obstruction
to
stop
us
from
delivering
the
truth
to
the
american
people
committee
members
learned
the
news
of
the
plan
in
a
friday
afternoon
phone
call
by
monday
morning
the
committee
had
released
a
resolution
detailing
the
new
procedures
for
the
thursday
vote
the
resolution
says
the
panel
will
allow
nadler
to
designate
which
hearings
are
linked
to
the
impeachment
probe
and
allow
committee
counsel
to
question
witnesses
for
an
additional
hour
with
minutes
divided
between
republicans
and
democrats
that
goes
beyond
the
five
minutes
allotted
to
each
lawmaker
monday
in
addition
the
panel
will
be
able
to
accept
evidence
in
closed
meetings
and
trump's
team
can
respond
in
writing
to
evidence
and
testimony
presented
to
the
committee
the
committee
has
taken
the
next
step
in
its
investigation
of
whether
to
approve
articles
of
impeachment
against
president
trump
said
a
democratic
aide
to
the
committee
during
monday's
call
it
was
a
busy
recess
for
us
it's
going
to
be
a
busy
fall
for
example
there
could
be
hearings
covering
startling
new
evidence
regarding
potential
violations
of
the
emoluments
clause
that
prohibits
self-enrichment
such
as
a
move
by
trump
to
host
next
year's
g-
summit
at
his
doral
fla
resort
and
vice
president
pence's
recent
stay
at
a
trump
resort
in
ireland
committee
aides
said
the
developments
come
on
the
heels
of
a
majority
of
house
democrats
publicly
announcing
support
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
according
to
npr's
impeachment
tracker
which
marks
a
milestone
that
was
reached
during
last
month's
recess
the
committee
has
intensified
its
investigation
a
democratic
committee
aide
said
the
mueller
hearings
were
an
important
inflection
point
and
this
is
the
next
step
in
the
process
there
haven't
been
any
formal
votes
on
launching
an
inquiry
or
hearings
on
articles
of
impeachment
but
many
democrats
on
the
panel
insist
that
the
committee's
investigations
amounted
to
forward
movement
on
the
issue
something
many
are
frustrated
hasn't
happened
sooner
some
democrats
have
accused
nadler
of
contributing
to
confusion
surrounding
the
inquiry
with
the
panel
telling
the
courts
in
filings
that
it
was
in
the
midst
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
while
telling
a
different
story
publicly
during
the
august
recess
nadler
told
cnn
that
the
committee
was
in
the
midst
of
formal
impeachment
proceedings
and
could
vote
out
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
house
floor
by
year's
end
for
pro-impeachment
house
democrats
the
rules
changes
are
a
procedural
and
symbolic
step
in
the
panel's
efforts
to
show
progress
despite
the
fact
that
its
investigations
have
yielded
little
new
evidence
implicating
the
president
outside
advocacy
groups
hoped
to
no
avail
that
the
summer
recess
would
increase
public
pressure
on
undecided
members
and
top
democratic
leaders
to
advance
impeachment
the
debate
about
what
exactly
the
committee
is
doing
also
highlights
the
growing
divide
among
house
democrats
pelosi
highlighted
her
concerns
in
an
aug
caucus
call
the
public
isn't
there
on
impeachment
it's
your
voice
and
constituency
but
give
me
the
leverage
i
need
to
make
sure
that
we're
ready
and
it
is
as
strong
as
it
can
be
pelosi
said
the
equities
we
have
to
weigh
are
our
responsibility
to
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
and
to
be
unifying
and
not
dividing
but
if
and
when
we
act
people
will
know
he
gave
us
no
choice
if
he
cannot
respect
the
constitution
we'll
have
to
deal
with
that
it's
about
patriotism
not
partisanship
