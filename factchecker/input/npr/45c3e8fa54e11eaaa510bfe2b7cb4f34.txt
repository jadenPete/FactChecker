for
the

this
week
amid
concerns
about

in

president
trump
will
return
to
the
world's
biggest
stage
this
week
to
address
heads
of
state
at
a
time
when
u.s.
global
leadership
is
seen
as
waning
when
he
takes
the
stage
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
for
the
third
time
on
tuesday
trump
is
expected
to
affirm
america's
leadership
role
and
underscore
that
america
is
a
positive
alternative
to
authoritarianism
said
a
senior
administration
official
leaders
will
be
closely
watching
how
he
addresses
global
concerns
about
the
u.s.
trade
battle
with
china
and
insecurity
over
the
persian
gulf
as
confidence
in
his
strategy
falters
during
last
year's
speech
many
of
those
same
leaders
appeared
to
laugh
when
trump
boasted
that
his
administration
has
accomplished
more
than
almost
any
administration
in
the
history
of
our
country
john
feeley
who
served
as
u.s.
ambassador
to
panama
until
last
year
called
it
a
painful
moment
that
reflected
america's
decline
from
the
undisputed
top
dog
on
the
world
stage
what
it
means
is
that
the
united
states
is
not
perceived
as
being
led
by
somebody
who
he's
still
very
very
powerful
they
take
completely
seriously
feeley
said
the
idea
that
u.s.
global
leadership
is
on
the
decline
should
be
no
surprise
trump
arrived
in
washington
promising
supporters
he'd
put
america
first
and
not
be
president
of
the
world
he
has
delivered
on
those
pledges
in
many
ways
shrinking
the
diplomatic
corps
and
pulling
out
of
both
the
paris
climate
accord
and
the
proposed
nation
trans-pacific
partnership
trade
agreement
a
nation
survey
by
the
pew
research
center
last
year
found
a
median
of
just
of
people
outside
the
united
states
had
confidence
trump
would
do
the
right
thing
in
world
affairs
and
a
new
survey
of
former
u.s.
ambassadors
and
senior
national
security
officials
by
the
global
situation
room
public
relations
firm
finds
that
top
diplomats
from
republican
and
democratic
administrations
almost
unanimously
feel
u.s.
influence
has
declined
under
trump
ninety-two
percent
of
those
surveyed
said
u.s.
adversaries
have
grown
stronger
ivo
daalder
who
served
as
the
u.s.
ambassador
to
nato
from
to
said
the
united
states
is
not
in
the
places
it
needs
to
be
he
quoted
george
shultz
who
served
as
secretary
of
state
during
the
reagan
administration
and
who
compared
diplomacy
to
gardening
a
healthy
garden
he
would
say
needs
regular
watering
and
weeds
pulled
before
they
grow
out
of
control
and
that's
true
for
diplomacy
daalder
said
you've
got
to
go
you've
got
to
be
in
the
countries
you've
got
to
understand
what
they're
doing
you've
got
to
spend
time
talking
to
people
and
measuring
their
concerns
and
getting
an
understanding
of
what
drives
them
so
that
you
can
reach
compromises
and
negotiate
deals
and
exert
american
influence
some
diplomats
have
bristled
at
trump's
apparent
affection
for
authoritarian
leaders
such
as
north
korea's
kim
jong
un
and
russia's
vladimir
putin
while
treating
traditional
allies
in
europe
more
like
adversaries
trump
has
embraced
his
lack
of
popularity
in
europe
during
a
recent
campaign
rally
in
north
carolina
he
boasted
about
how
he
has
pressured
european
leaders
to
contribute
money
to
nato
defense
funds
saying
that
this
has
made
former
president
barack
obama
more
liked
in
germany
he's
got
to
be
trump
told
the
enthusiastic
crowd
i'm
making
people
pay
their
bills
he's
got
to
be
you
know
the
day
that
i'm
more
popular
than
him
i'm
not
doing
my
job
brett
bruen
who
served
as
the
white
house
director
of
global
engagement
in
the
obama
administration
and
now
leads
global
situation
said
concerns
raised
by
top
u.s.
diplomats
reflect
how
bad
they
feel
the
problem
has
become
it's
easy
to
argue
they
have
sour
grapes
that
there
was
some
personal
concern
that
they
were
expressing
bruen
said
but
you
know
diplomats
having
served
alongside
them
for
a
decade
and
a
half
are
not
the
folks
who
are
going
to
by
their
nature
stand
up
and
speak
out
they're
used
to
speaking
on
behalf
of
their
government
in
some
ways
leaders
are
moving
on
without
trump
there
will
be
two
high-level
meetings
on
climate
change
and
universal
health
care
at
the
th
united
nations
general
assembly
trump
is
expected
to
have
little
to
do
with
either
jeffrey
feltman
a
former
u.s.
undersecretary-general
for
political
affairs
and
former
chief
foreign
policy
adviser
to
u.n.
secretary-general
ant
nio
guterres
said
leaders
in
france
and
germany
are
trying
to
renew
the
multilateral
system
and
combat
the
isolationism
of
the
u.s.
and
other
countries
i
don't
know
how
effective
this
will
be
but
it's
an
example
of
how
some
of
our
traditional
allies
are
organizing
themselves
in
response
to
the
feeling
that
the
united
states
the
u.k.
that
other
sort
of
major
engines
in
the
u.n.
system
no
longer
are
pressing
the
accelerator
said
feltman
who
is
now
a
fellow
at
the
brookings
institution
it's
not
all
trump's
fault
said
john
simon
who
served
as
u.s.
ambassador
to
the
african
union
he
said
that
while
the
trump
administration
has
failed
to
maintain
important
alliances
with
traditional
allies
the
american
public
has
also
grown
tired
of
the
burdens
of
american
leadership
simon
said
the
solution
is
not
just
changing
the
president
but
helping
people
understand
why
global
leadership
is
important
to
upholding
american
values
part
of
the
reason
the
president
is
the
president
is
because
he
articulated
a
vision
of
the
united
states
in
the
world
that
was
somewhat
at
odds
with
our
traditional
role
as
a
leader
on
the
world
stage
