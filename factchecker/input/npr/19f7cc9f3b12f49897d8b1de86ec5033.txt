r-fla
and
other
members
of
congress
are
appealing
a
decision
by
the
department
of
veterans
affairs
to
evict
them
from
office
spaces
at
va
hospitals
the
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
has
told
several
members
of
congress
that
he's
evicting
them
from
offices
they've
been
using
in
va
hospitals
the
house
members
use
the
offices
to
meet
with
vets
and
discuss
everything
from
their
eligibility
for
benefits
to
the
quality
of
the
care
they
receive
the
va
says
it
wants
the
spaces
back
for
clinical
uses
but
one
of
the
lawmakers
rep
brian
mast
r-fla
thinks
it's
personal
mast's
district
extends
from
palm
beach
north
to
port
st
lucie
and
like
many
of
his
constituents
he
is
a
veteran
he
lost
both
his
legs
working
as
a
bomb
disposal
expert
in
afghanistan
i
get
all
my
health
care
from
the
va
mast
says
so
i'm
there
regularly
getting
health
care
needs
taken
care
of
mast
has
been
an
activist
on
veterans
issues
in
congress
since
he
was
elected
in
last
year
he
became
the
first
congressman
to
open
an
office
inside
a
va
facility
the
va
medical
center
in
west
palm
beach
five
other
members
of
congress
all
florida
democrats
followed
suit
last
month
they
received
a
letter
from
the
va
telling
them
that
their
time
was
up
and
they
would
have
to
move
out
by
the
end
of
the
year
mast
urged
the
va
to
reconsider
on
his
facebook
page
he
posted
a
video
of
a
contentious
hearing
in
april
where
he
questioned
va
secretary
robert
wilkie
over
security
issues
and
suicides
at
the
west
palm
beach
hospital
at
the
hearing
mast
pressed
wilkie
on
when
he
would
visit
i
will
say
as
soon
as
possible
wilkie
says
in
the
video
but
mast
interrupts
i
was
a
bomb
technician
the
congressman
says
we
used
to
always
use
vague
terms
like
that
so
people
would
never
know
exactly
when
we
would
get
on
the
ground
i
would
like
a
more
specific
answer
mast
has
linked
the
decision
to
evict
him
to
that
hearing
wilkie
says
the
decision
to
evict
members
of
congress
from
offices
in
va
facilities
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
hearing
or
congressional
oversight
of
the
agency
in
a
letter
to
mast
wilkie
said
the
va
needs
the
offices
for
clinical
space
mast's
office
he
says
will
be
used
for
a
smoking
cessation
program
appearing
on
fox
news
recently
wilkie
said
i
want
the
space
i
want
it
for
our
veterans
i'm
not
stopping
the
congress
from
getting
their
oversight
in
they
have
offices
that
are
already
paid
for
mast
and
his
congressional
colleagues
want
to
stay
they're
co-sponsoring
a
bill
requiring
the
va
to
allow
members
of
congress
to
use
its
facilities
to
meet
with
constituents
at
a
news
conference
in
washington
mast
said
it's
an
easy
way
to
improve
veterans
care
we
provide
veterans
with
more
access
to
care
more
services
and
more
oversight
without
in
any
way
negatively
affecting
anybody
in
spaces
smaller
than
the
size
of
the
stage
we're
sitting
on
he
said
the
va
medical
center
in
west
palm
beach
is
a
sprawling
complex
spread
over
million
square
feet
inside
in
addition
to
the
pharmacy
chapel
clinics
and
other
medical
facilities
there's
a
coffee
shop
a
food
court
and
a
retail
store
and
down
one
hallway
is
the
windowless
congressional
office
which
is
about
the
size
of
a
large
broom
closet
vietnam
veteran
dennis
gelsomino
says
it's
a
small
space
but
important
for
people
like
him
having
that
office
in
there
is
a
conduit
for
veterans
to
go
in
and
speak
with
a
representative
gelsomino
says
they
can
voice
their
concerns
and
ask
questions
and
then
in
some
cases
get
a
congressional
inquiry
on
what's
going
on
with
their
case
after
seeing
what
mast
had
done
in
west
palm
beach
rep
stephanie
murphy
d-fla
whose
district
is
in
central
florida
opened
an
office
at
the
va
hospital
in
orlando
like
mast
she
received
an
eviction
notice
from
the
va
and
rejects
the
notion
that
it's
because
the
hospitals
need
more
space
let's
be
clear
murphy
says
this
decision
came
from
washington
not
orlando
or
west
palm
beach
our
partners
in
our
local
hospitals
see
the
value
that
we
offer
and
so
this
isn't
an
issue
with
them
this
is
a
bureaucratic
decision
that's
coming
from
washington
murphy
mast
and
other
members
of
congress
hope
wilkie
will
reconsider
his
decision
and
allow
them
to
keep
their
offices
at
the
va
hospitals
in
the
meantime
they
expect
a
hearing
soon
on
a
bill
that
would
make
that
the
law
