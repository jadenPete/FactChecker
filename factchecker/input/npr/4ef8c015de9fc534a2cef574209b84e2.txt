current

former
u.s.
officials
tell
npr
the
national
security
council
is
traditionally
one
of
the
most
desirable
places
for
ambitious
and
talented
people
to
work
in
the
u.s.
government
because
it
affords
such
close
proximity
to
power
but
in
the
trump
administration
some
of
the
government's
brightest
minds
are
turning
down
high-powered
nsc
assignments
and
others
are
avoiding
the
place
altogether
career
foreign
policy
professionals
increasingly
fear
that
joining
the
nsc
which
is
part
of
the
white
house
will
taint
them
as
political
operatives
there
is
a
school
of
thought
that
it
can
be
risky
for
your
career
sometimes
being
there
puts
you
in
a
position
where
you
have
to
say
no
to
ambassadors
and
other
senior
officials
and
they
may
remember
that
when
you
return
said
one
senior
foreign
policy
official
who
turned
down
an
offer
to
serve
at
the
nsc
it's
a
stunning
reversal
for
jobs
that
once
offered
unparalleled
credentials
openings
for
temporary
assignments
that
in
previous
administrations
would
have
drawn
two
dozen
applications
and
inquiries
are
now
getting
minimal
interest
the
officials
said
npr
interviewed
current
and
former
u.s.
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
nsc's
challenges
most
have
served
both
in
the
trump
administration
and
past
administrations
many
declined
to
be
publicly
identified
for
fear
it
would
endanger
their
careers
and
professional
relationships
the
national
security
council
staff
is
comprised
of
exceptional
public
servants
from
across
the
u.s.
government
who
are
working
diligently
to
support
president
trump's
highly-effective
national
security
agenda
there
is
no
shortage
of
patriotic
individuals
willing
to
work
on
these
critical
issues
said
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
in
a
statement
to
npr
a
senior
nsc
official
dismissed
concerns
that
people
don't
hold
the
nsc
in
the
same
regard
as
before
he
said
trump
has
sought
to
slim
down
the
nsc
so
there
may
not
be
as
many
opportunities
the
people
he
knew
though
were
proud
of
their
work
and
extended
their
assignments
while
an
nsc
job
has
historically
been
known
as
a
launchpad
for
high-flying
careers
these
officials
tell
npr
that
under
trump
u.s.
foreign
policy
has
become
so
erratic
confrontational
and
politicized
that
many
feel
out
of
place
or
worse
chuck
park
a
career
foreign
service
officer
who
served
in
the
trump
administration
until
july
said
getting
an
nsc
job
is
like
a
rocket
ship
for
your
career
an
economic
affairs
specialist
park
had
pursued
an
nsc
position
in
after
his
third
tour
of
duty
but
didn't
get
it
he
expected
to
try
again
after
his
fourth
but
by
then
in
park
said
he
was
too
pissed
off
and
upset
about
trump
administration
policies
such
as
family
separation
and
the
president's
rhetoric
on
immigration
he
didn't
like
what
he
interpreted
as
trump's
defense
of
white
nationalism
and
explained
his
resignation
in
an
essay
published
by
the
washington
post
last
month
i
would
have
absolutely
wholeheartedly
thrown
my
hat
in
the
ring
under
a
different
president
and
different
national
security
adviser
said
park
referring
to
trump's
previous
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
whom
trump
ousted
on
sept
a
job
the
national
security
council
is
the
president's
main
advisory
body
for
considering
national
security
and
foreign
policy
matters
it
also
coordinates
national
security
priorities
with
different
u.s.
government
agencies
the

top
staff

from
agencies
across
the
administration
including
the
state
department
defense
department
u.s.
agency
for
international
development
and
cia
on
temporary
assignments
those
one-year
temporary
assignments
which
are
often
renewable
are
highly
coveted
and
some
of
the
officials
interviewed
for
this
story
said
they
were
surprised
to
learn
the
lengths
the
nsc
is
going
to
attract
staff
others
told
npr
that
their
senior
managers
discouraged
them
from
accepting
nsc
positions
going
into
the
nsc
is
not
an
easy
thing
by
any
means
said
fernando
cutz
who
served
as
a
senior
director
at
the
nsc
in
the
trump
administration
until
last
year
you're
working
all
sorts
of
hours
essentially
you're
either
on
call
or
in
the
office
and
at
times
both
and
you're
not
getting
paid
any
more
money
cutz
said
working
at
the
nsc
was
particularly
difficult
under
the
brief
tenure
of
trump's
first
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
who
was
under
investigation
for
his
ties
to
russia
it
improved
under
flynn's
successor
h.r.
mcmaster
who
ran
the
nsc
more
along
the
lines
of
past
administrations
by
seeking
input
from
around

a
book
about
the
national

council
said
a
hamstrung
nsc
carries
risks
to
foreign
policy
the
staff
itself
is
a
really
critical
piece
of
this
said
gans
because
the
staff
is
a
big
part
of
the
national
security
adviser's
strength
if
he
doesn't
have
that
sort
of
public
reputation
deep
relationships
with
his
cabinet
colleagues
or
a
deep
relationship
with
the
president
the
staff
can
give
the
national
security
adviser
a
shot
he
can
get
ideas
he
can
get
intelligence
he
can
get
muscle
from
them
to
try
and
drive
his
ideas
through
outflank
cabinet
secretaries
do
all
those
kinds
of
things
congress
created
the
nsc
through
the
national
security
act
of
the
idea
was
to
create
a
body
within
the
white
house
to
gather
and
study
various
viewpoints
from
the
president's
cabinet
and
advisers
to
be
shared
with
the
president
but
critics
charged
that
bolton
failed
to
live
up
to
his
honest
broker
role
by
limiting
debate
inside
the
government
you're
really
doing
it
out
of
a
love
of
your
country
out
of
a
sense
of
patriotism
and
out
of
a
belief
in
the
system
when
that
system
isn't
necessarily
working
the
way
that
it's
designed
to
work
that
has
to
give
you
extra
pause
cutz
said
are
you
prepared
to
dedicate
essentially
your
entire
life
to
a
system
that
isn't
going
to
actually
respect
you
finding
policy
to
fit
trump's
rhetoric
several
current
and
former
officials
described
the
challenge
of
coming
up
with
policies
that
could
match
the
president's
words
they
pointed
to
being
pressed
to
find
military
options
in
venezuela
despite
a
near
consensus
among
senior
leaders
of
opposition
to
military
action
they
cited
trump's
lack
of
interest
in
intelligence
information
particularly
on
russia
and
they
also
talked
about
trump's
willingness
to
ignore
advice
from
foreign
policy
professionals
others
cited
the
president's
braggadocio
and
said
his
language
and
style
haven't
helped
secure
foreign
policy
wins
on
trade
or
headed
off
iran's
nuclear
ambitions
many
senior-level
nsc
staffers
are
trying
either
to
go
overseas
and
to
ride
out
the
administration
or
to
find
jobs
in
the
department
that
are
detailed
to
other
places
said
brett
bruen
who
served
as
the
white
house
director
of
global
engagement
in
the
obama
administration
and
remains
in
contact
with
nsc
and
state
department
officials
basically
anything
that
you
can
get
to
avoid
having
to
be
in
a
serious
policy
job
which
is
almost
a
from
the
way
those
jobs
were
looked
at
beforehand
some
of
the
current
and
former
officials
interviewed
for
this
story
blame
bolton
for
installing
too
many
political
appointees
and
eliminating
much
of
the
coordination
with
other
parts
of
the
government
a
request
for
a
comment
from
bolton
was
declined
but
others
say
even
before
bolton
became
national
security
adviser
trump
had
already
undercut
the
nsc's
relevance
in
shaping
policy
positions
eschewing
the
advice
of
top
officials
in
favor
of
his
own
gut
instincts
last
week
trump
said
being
national
security
adviser
is
an
easy
job
it's
a
great
job
it's
great
because
it's
a
lot
of
fun
to
work
with
donald
trump
trump
said
and
it's
very
easy
actually
to
work
with
me
you
know
why
it's
easy
because
i
make
all
the
decisions
they
don't
have
to
work
after
announcing
on
wednesday
that
o'brien
would
be
his
new
national
security
adviser
trump
downplayed
his
previous
comments
saying
the
position
is
a
very
important
role
it's
really
a
role
that
if
the
president
respects
the
person
that's
the
adviser
i
think
it
really
plays
an
important
role
the
senior
nsc
official
said
the
nsc
continues
to
attract
some
of
the
most
talented
people
in
the
federal
government
staffers
seek
to
stay
away
from
politics
he
said
they
are
proud
of
the
work
done
in
the
middle
east
reducing
tensions
with
north
korea
and
bringing
home
u.s.
hostages
from
abroad
people
come
here
because
they
believe
in
the
policies
they
work
on
the
official
said
it's
not
a
highly
political
place
another
senior
administration
official
who
wasn't
authorized
to
speak
publicly
dismissed
the
concerns
and
said
the
nsc
sometimes
asks
for
volunteers
and
sometimes
it
hand-picks
candidates
other
officials
who
worked
with
bolton
said
that
he's
wrongly
being
blamed
as
the
main
problem
at
the
nsc
and
that
while
bolton
curtailed
coordination
with
other
parts
of
the
government
it
eased
the
workload
and
he
wasn't
personally
difficult
he
wasn't
some
jerk
or
anything
like
that
said
one
former
nsc
official
he
wasn't
tough
on
the
staff
he
was
very
nice
to
all
of
us
he
was
approachable
tradition
of
service
like
in
many
parts
of
the
federal
government
there's
a
long
tradition
at
the
nsc

that

you

you
can't
get
away
from
it
said
a
former
white
house
official
who
served
in
the
trump
administration
until
last
year
you
are
literally
part
of
the
administration
responsible
and
if
you
can't
compartmentalize
it's
a
very
difficult
emotional
cross
to
bear
some
turned
to
professional
counseling
for
help
as
they
wrestled
over
emotions
of
whether
they
were
protecting
u.s.
interests
or
enabling
bad
behavior
one
veteran
foreign
service
officer
who
served
under
multiple
administrations
including
the
trump
administration
said
there
is
now
an
unspoken
belief
among
some
top
career
officials
that
it's
important
to
preserve
talent
for
future
administrations
by
keeping
them
away
from
assignments
too
closely
tied
to
the
white
house
you've
got
a
really
bright-eyed
bushy-tailed
person
like
somebody
who
you
know
can
go
far
in
this
business
you're
not
going

want
them
to
get
mowed
down
the
foreign

officer
said
and
you're
going
to
say
they
know
we
all
live
to
serve
but
it's
really
important
to
be
around
to
fight
another
day
and
you
are
going
to
carry
the
institution
going
forward
so
let's
go
hide
you
in
the
past
park
the
foreign
service
officer
who
resigned
said
nsc
jobs
were
so
prestigious
that
many
ambitious
foreign
service
officers
would
make
a
bid
for
an
opening
even
if
they
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
get
it
this
is
the
kind
of
position
where
people
take

in

they
