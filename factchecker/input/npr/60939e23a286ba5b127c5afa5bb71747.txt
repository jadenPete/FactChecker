silvio
gesell
hated
money
a
german
entrepreneur
who
moved
to
argentina
for
business
in
the
late
th
century
he
witnessed
a
massive
financial
crash
in
that
convinced
him
that
money
was
behind
the
world's
economic
problems
poverty
inequality
unemployment
stagnation
the
problem
gesell
believed
was
that
money
served
two
roles
that
often
came
into
conflict
it
was
a
way
for
people
to
store
wealth
and
it
was
the
thing
everybody
needed
to
conduct
business
the
fact
that
money
could
store
wealth
meant
its
holders
had
a
reason
to
cling
to
it
especially
in
crises
like
the
one
he
saw
in
argentina
when
opportunities
to
safely
put
that
money
elsewhere
looked
grim
it
was
a
typical
story
when
people
got
scared
they
hoarded
cash
and
brought
business
to
a
standstill
it
led
gesell
said
to
a
situation
of
poverty
amid
plenty
gesell
wanted
to
create
a
new
kind
of
money
a
money
that
would
rot
like
potatoes
and
rust
like
iron
so
no
one
would
want
to
hoard
it
a
money
that
was
an
instrument
of
exchange
and
nothing
else
and
the
crazy
part
is
that
he
did
create
it
through
a
series
of
pamphlets
articles
and
books
gesell
inspired
a
worldwide
movement
that
introduced
a
completely
new
form
of
money
it's
one
of
the
most
fascinating
and
largely
forgotten
stories
in
economic
history
but
after
years
of
obscurity
gesell
is
making
a
comeback
all
of
a
sudden
this
obscure
radical
from
another
age
has
his
name
and
ideas
popping
up
in
unlikely
places
like
speeches
of
leaders
at
the
u.s.
federal
reserve
research
papers
of
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
pages
of
the
financial
times
as
the
industrialized
world
grapples
with
stagnation
and
as
markets
signal
another
recession
policymakers
are
struggling
to
figure
out
what
to
do
could
gesell
provide
an
answer
money
with
an
expiration
date
gesell
was
born
in
to
a
german
father
and
a
french
mother
and
he
was
raised
in
what
is
now
belgium
back
then
it
was
part
of
the
expanding
prussian
empire
at
he
moved
to
buenos
aires
argentina
where
he
worked
as
an
importer
and
manufacturer
and
did
well
for
himself
on
the
side
he
taught
himself
economics
in
hoping
to
end
the
depression
in
argentina
gesell
published
his
first
work
currency
reform
as
a
bridge
to
the
social
state
he
proposed
a
new
kind
of
paper
money
that
would
have
an
expiration
date
to
avoid
expiration
the
bills
would
have
to
be
periodically
stamped
for
a
fee
with
no
new
stamp
they
would
become
worthless
in
this
system
saving
money
would
cost
you
money
savings
in
other
words
would
have
a
negative
interest
rate
only
by
spending
or
investing
it
would
you
be
able
to
avoid
stamp
fees
gesell
called
it
free
money
or
freigold
free
because
he
believed
it
would
be
freed
from
hoarding
and
also
because
it
would
encourage
bankers
to
lend
money
without
charging
interest
the
logic
was
this
if
you're
holding
on
to
something
that's
dropping
in
value
you'll
happily
part
with
it
even
if
it
means
that
it
won't
make
you
more
money
than
you
started
with
it's
like
a
game
of
hot
potatoes
you
want
to
pass
it
on
gesell
believed
this
would
keep
money
whizzing
through
the
system
preventing
future
depressions
and
increasing
public
prosperity
it
was
a
completely
radical
idea
especially
during
a
time
when
nations
were
on
the
gold
standard
that
system
latched
money
to
the
stable
value
of
gold
which
meant
currency
was
a
pretty
safe
place
to
store
wealth
gesell
was
saying
he
didn't
want
money
to
be
like
gold
he
wanted
it
to
be
like
most
other
objects
which
decay
and
rust
and
go
bad
of
course
many
people
hated
this
idea
especially
people
with
a
lot
of
money
in
gesell
began
moving
back
and
forth
between
europe
and
argentina
spreading
the
gospel
of
free
money
and
writing
extensively
on
other
matters
as
well
he
had
a
bunch
of
eccentric
views
criticizing
monogamous
relationships
and
advocating
free
love
he
lived
in
a
vegetarian
commune
near
berlin
for
a
time
he
was
a
bohemian
utopian
who
advocated
for
peace
between
nations
he
was
critical
of
big
business
and
finance
but
he
believed
in
individual
freedom
and
market
competition
and
he
was
a
committed
anti-racist
as
fascism
rose
in
germany
gesell
would
call
the
scapegoating
of
jews
for
the
nation's
problems
a
colossal
injustice
after
world
war
i
gesell
watched
europe
descend
into
political
and
economic
chaos
in
anarchist
revolutionaries
in
munich
germany
took
the
helm
of
the
short-lived
bavarian
republic
and
they
persuaded
gesell
to
become
their
finance
minister
led
by
pacifist
poets
and
playwrights
it
has
been
called
one
of
the
strangest
governments
in
the
history
of
any
country
gesell
began
pursuing
a
program
that
included
land
reform
a
basic
income
for
women
with
children
and
of
course
stamped
money
but
the
job
lasted
less
than
a
week
ending
after
another
group
of
revolutionaries
this
time
led
by
hard-line
communists
overthrew
the
anarchist
poets
and
playwrights
a
year
later
after
the
german
government
reasserted
control
gesell
was
tried
for
treason
but
successfully
arguing
that
his
only
role
and
purpose
was
to
rescue
the
bavarian
economy
he
was
acquitted
after
a
one-day
trial
and
went
back
to
writing
free
money
becomes
real
money
for
decades
money
that
expired
unless
stamped
was
mostly
a
theory
it
took
the
great
depression
to
make
it
a
reality
as
the
economy
went
into
a
free-fall
people
scrambled
to
find
solutions
and
in
towns
scattered
throughout
europe
and
the
united
states
they
found
their
solution
in
gesell
the
money
reformer
who
died
in
of
pneumonia
would
not
live
to
see
it
in
in
the
small
town
of
w
rgl
austria
a
town
leader
michael
unterguggenberger
got
w
rgl
to
issue
stamped
money
as
a
way
to
combat
skyrocketing
unemployment
and
business
closures
the
town
used
it
to
pay
the
unemployed
to
do
public
works
and
by
all
contemporary
accounts
the
system
worked
to
lift
the
town
out
of
misery
the
press
dubbed
it
the
miracle
of
w
rgl
and
it
was
one
in
a
series
of
local
experiments
with
stamped
money
these
experiments
inspired
many
other
struggling
cities
like
hawarden
iowa
and
anaheim
calif
to
do
the
same
it
was
around
then
that
gesell's
work
was
finally
published
in
english
with
classical
economics
discredited
by
the
prolonged
depression
and
with
leading
economists
scrambling
to
figure
out
what
to
do
many
were
inspired
by
gesell
among
them
were
irving
fisher
and
john
maynard
keynes
two
of
the
most
influential
economists
of
the
th
century
in
fisher
wrote
a
short
book
inspired
by
gesell's
ideas
called
stamp
scrip
fisher
was
an
economist
at
yale
university
and
he's
now
somewhat
unfairly
remembered
for
making
overly
optimistic
predictions
before
the
crash
of
he
lobbied
congress
to
institute
stamped
money
to
provide
relief
to
a
distressed
america
u.s.
senators
introduced
a
bill
s.
that
would
have
issued
a
billion
dollars
of
stamped
money
to
be
distributed
nationally
but
it
did
not
end
up
becoming
law
perhaps
that's
because
that
year
was
already
seeing
huge
changes
with
newly
elected
president
franklin
d.
roosevelt
implementing
the
new
deal
and
taking
the
u.s.
off
the
gold
standard
keynes
in
dedicated
five
pages
to
gesell
in
a
concluding
chapter
of
his
magnum
opus
the
general
theory
of
employment
interest
and
money
while
critiquing
some
of
gesell's
overall
theory
keynes
concluded
the
idea
behind
stamped
money
is
sound
why
do
we
care
about
this
now
after
world
war
ii
the
industrialized
world
entered
a
remarkable
period
of
economic
growth
and
central
banks
now
off
a
rigid
gold
standard
played
a
greater
role
in
managing
money
to
ease
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
market
negative-interest
money
lost
its
allure
and
gesell
was
mostly
forgotten
but
the
world's
central
banks
are
now
thinking
about
how
to
keep
money
moving
again
when
the
economy
enters
a
downturn
they
usually
cut
interest
rates
to
encourage
spending
but
interest
rates
are
already
close
to
zero
which
could
be
a
huge
problem
in
another
recession
for
a
long
time
economists
believed
rates
couldn't
go
negative
for
a
simple
reason
if
saving
in
places
like
a
bank
costs
people
money
they
will
instead
just
hoard
cash
which
won't
cost
them
money
cash
becomes
a
roadblock
to
economic
stimulus
one
way
around
this
is
higher
inflation
which
devalues
or
taxes
money
in
real
terms
but
central
banks
like
the
fed
have
been
showing
that
they
have
much
less
power
to
increase
inflation
than
previously
thought
central
banks
in
europe
and
japan
have
been
experimenting
with
teeny-tiny
negative
interest
rates
as
a
way
to
stimulate
the
economy
but
the
issue
still
remains
that
people
will
start
hoarding
cash
if
rates
go
significantly
negative
it's
why
serious
economic
thinkers
consider
gesell
relevant
again
in
our
technological
age
a
gesellian
system
of
unhoardable
cash
wouldn't
actually
have
to
involve
stamping
paper
bills
for
a
fee
it
could
involve
high-tech
physical
cash
such
as
magnetic
strips
that
allow
the
government
to
impose
a
gesell
tax
on
holding
cash
as
one
economist
proposed
some
years
ago
harvard
university's
kenneth
rogoff
has
been
advocating
we
get
rid
of
paper
money
altogether
and
move
almost
completely
to
a
system
of
electronic
cash
he
believes
it
could
give
central
banks
the
power
to
impose
negative
interest
rates
deep
enough
to
rescue
our
economy
from
future
recessions
in
all
of
this
gesell
was
a
pioneer
silvio
gesell
has
been
called
everything
from
a
libertarian
socialist
to
an
anarchist
to
a
free
spirit
to
a
crank
john
maynard
keynes
had
a
much
more
affectionate
term
for
him
a
strange
unduly
neglected
prophet
