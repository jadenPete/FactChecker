as
more
democrats

the
topic
of
impeachment
is
back
and
hotter
than
ever
in
washington
but
is
it
back
by
popular
demand
will
the
issue
simmer
into
the
fall
or
will
the
heat
dissipate
in
the
days
ahead
more
democrats
than
ever
a
majority
now
favor
opening
formal
proceedings
to
remove
president
trump
from
office
more
joined
the
chorus
over
the
weekend
after
reports
suggested
trump
pressured
an
ally
to
support
a
certain
line
of
attack
on
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
but
the
fever
for
impeachment
has
yet
to
be
felt
by
much
of
the
public
at
large
polling
over
the
first
months
of
trump's
tenure
has
occasionally
shown
his
approval
ratings
fall
measurably
as
they
did
after
the
charlottesville
white
supremacy
march
in
and
during
the
government
shutdown
earlier
this
year
in
the
wake
of
robert
mueller's
spring
report
on
russian
interference
in
the
campaign
some
polls
even
showed
support
for
impeachment
rising
through
the
s
or
touching
but
other
polls
including
those
that
did
not
reference
the
mueller
report
found
support
for
impeachment
proceedings
still
well
under
after
that
as
in
previous
instances
the
moment
faded
and
other
stories
intruded
and
impeachment
support
subsided
the
truth
is
impeachment
has
almost
never
been
popular
it
tends
to
pump
up
the
partisans
in
either
party
but
has
far
less
allure
for
the
less
politically
inclined
independent
voters
it
should
be
noted
have
been
especially
slow
to
take
up
the
impeachment
cry
it
may
be
aversion
to
the
disruption
or
dread
of
the
all-consuming
nature
of
the
process
that
devours
the
congressional
agenda
and
relentlessly
dominates
the
news
media
surely
those
are
among
the
memories
that
linger
from
the
impeachment
of
president
bill
clinton
two
decades
ago
the
clinton
impeachment
in
december
was
never
supported
by
anything
close
to
a
majority
in
the
gallup
poll
a
year
later
it
was
more
popular
and
supported
by
in
the
month
he
was
impeached
by
the
house
of
representatives
only
of
americans
supported
removing
him
from
office
remarkably
in
the
same
poll
nearly
two-thirds
said
they
thought
clinton
was
guilty
of
the
charges
involved
the
following
month
a
republican
senate
could
not
muster
the
needed
two-thirds
vote
or
even
a
simple
majority
to
convict
clinton
on
either
of
the
articles
of
impeachment
backed
by
the
house
from
time
to
time
members
of
the
house
have
since
proposed
impeaching
clinton's
successors
george
w.
bush
and
barack
obama
any
individual
member
can
go
to
the
floor
and
do
this
but
that
came
to
nothing
in
both
cases
the
lesson
both
parties
clearly
had
taken
away
from
the
clinton
case
was
that
the
public
is
cool
at
best
to
the
whole
business
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
been
adamant
in
her
resistance
to
impeachment
proceedings
that
have
neither
bipartisan
backing
nor
broad
public
support
she
had
already
served
a
decade
of
her
house
career
at
the
time
of
clinton's
impeachment
and
acquittal
and
she
saw
how
his
approval
ratings
actually
rose
at
that
time
and
through
his
remaining
time
in
office
that
is
clearly
not
a
scenario
she
would
wish
to
reprise
in
the
next
months
but
pelosi
was
also
around
for
that
other
impeachment
process
of
the
th
century
the
one
involving
richard
nixon
though
not
yet
a
candidate
for
office
pelosi
was
a
california
mom
in
her
early
s
and
active
in
democratic
politics
her
father
had
been
a
congressman
and
the
mayor
of
baltimore
she
surely
remembers
how
difficult
it
had
been
to
sell
the
public
on
the
case
against
nixon
a
case
so
overwhelming
by
the
summer
of
that
he
chose
to
resign
in
the
face
of
certain
impeachment
with
senators
from
his
own
party
telling
him
he
had
to
go
yet
even
as
nixon's
washington
power
base
eroded
and
then
collapsed
the
public
accepted
the
change
only
grudgingly
in
a
pew
research
center
study
the
center's
director
and
pollster
andrew
kohut
noted
how
long
the
public
had
resisted
nixon's
impeachment
even
as
his
approval
rating
declined
to
historic
lows
even
after
a
long
summer
of
televised
senate
hearings
in
began
the
slide
in
his
approval
gallup
found
only
about
in
americans
thought
nixon
should
go
even
after
nixon
fired
the
special
prosecutor
attorney
general
and
deputy
attorney
general
in
the
saturday
night
massacre
that
fall
the
gallup
percentage
for
removal
went
up
only
percentage
points
and
remained
below
that
figure
would
drift
upward
through
the
winter
and
spring
of
a
time
when
it
moved
in
a
range
similar
to
the
current
impeachment
numbers
for
president
trump
only
in
early
august
following
the
house
judiciary
committee's
recommendation
that
nixon
be
impeached
and
the
supreme
court's
decision
that
he
surrender
his
audio
tapes
did
a
clear
majority
come
to
the
view
that
the
president
should
be
removed
from
office
kohut
wrote
but
the
actual
trauma
of
these
impeachment
episodes
would
not
be
the
full
story
for
politicians
of
pelosi's
generation
they
have
lived
through
nearly
half
a
century
of
subsequent
political
hurly-burly
witnessing
how
the
backlash
to
impeachment
has
colored
american
politics
since
the
nixon
ouster
may
have
seemed
a
resounding
end
to
that
scandal
but
it
may
also
have
set
in
motion
some
of
the
political
forces
that
have
roiled
american
politics
since
rick
perlstein
is
a
historian
and
journalist
whose
books
include
nixonland
the
rise
of
a
president
and
the
fracturing
of
america
he
has
argued
that
the
takedown
of
nixon
who
had
won
states
in
was
traumatic
for
much
of
the
nation
but
in
different
ways
in
an
interview
published
last
month
in
mother
jones
perlstein
argues
that
for
a
more
sizable
portion
of
the
population
than
was
apparent
at
the
time
nixon's
departure
engendered
deep
resentment
spawning
much
of
the
energy
and
tactics
seen
on
the
right
in
the
decades
since
including
in
the
rise
of
trump
it
felt
somehow
the
liberals
were
kind
of
putting
one
over
on
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
reversing
the
results
of
the
election
he
wrote
in
retrospect
the
kind
of
things
they
were
saying
then
about
this
liberal
coup
to
unseat
a
popular
president
sound
a
lot
like
what
you
hear
on
fox
news
now
