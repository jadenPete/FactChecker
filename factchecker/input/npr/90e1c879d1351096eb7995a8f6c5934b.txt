nobody's

is
at

after
national

contradicted
president

claim
last
week
that
the
state
would
be

by

dorian
jacobs
delivered
a
keynote
speech
tuesday
at
the
national
weather
association's
annual
meeting
in
huntsville
ala
he
defended
a
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
statement
issued
friday
that
was
widely
seen
as
backing
the
president
but
he
also
expressed
support
for
the
national
weather
service
and
its
forecasters
the
unsigned
statement
from
the
nws's
parent
agency
was
meant
to
clarify
the
technical
aspects
of
dorian's
potential
impact
jacobs
said
what
it
did
not
say
however
is
that
we
understand
and
fully
support
the
good
intent
of
the
birmingham
weather
forecast
office
he
added
which
was
to
calm
fears
in
support
of
public
safety
jacobs
continued
i
am
proud
of
the
outstanding
work
performed
by
all
of
the
weather
forecast
offices
including
birmingham
during
the
span
of
the
storm
the
speech's
tone
was
markedly
different
from
that
of
noaa's
statement
which
appeared
to
criticize
the
birmingham
office
by
saying
it
had
spoken
in
absolute
terms
that
were
inconsistent
with
probabilities
from
the
best
forecast
products
available
at
the
time
among
those
listening
to
jacobs
remarks
was
kevin
laws
science
and
operations
officer
for
the
nws
office
in
birmingham
afterward
when
asked
why
he
thought
noaa
released
that
statement
laws
said
you
know
i
really
have
no
idea
i
mean
they
didn't
talk
to
us
about
why
they
did
it
so
it's
hard
to
say
why
they
did
but
i
don't
think
anybody
here
takes
it
personally
noaa's
statement
followed
an
uproar
over
the
president's
extraordinary
use
of
a
modified
nws
map
in
an
oval
office
video
an
official
forecast
for
dorian's
potential
path
toward
the
u.s.
that
included
what
looked
to
be
a
hand-drawn
black
bubble
adding
part
of
alabama
on
monday
the
controversy
flared
again
on
news
that
noaa's
acting
chief
scientist
craig
mclean
is
investigating
why
the
agency's
leadership
endorsed
trump's
incorrect
tweet
about
the
danger
for
alabama
despite
the
pushback
from
the
birmingham-based
meteorologists
that
same
day
the
new
york
times
reported
that
noaa
took
the
action
after
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
allegedly
threatened
to
fire
top
employees
at
the
agency
which
is
part
of
the
commerce
department
if
they
didn't
back
the
president
a
commerce
department
spokesman
denied
those
allegations
in
an
email
to
npr
in
his
remarks
tuesday
jacobs
sought
to
ease
concerns
that
climate
data
and
weather
forecasts
are
at
risk
of
being
politicized
under
the
trump
administration
there
is
no
pressure
to
change
the
way
we
communicate
forecast
risk
in
the
future
jacobs
said
no
one's
job
is
under
threat
not
mine
not
yours
he
added
that
the
national
weather
service
has
his
full
support
along
with
the
support
of
the
commerce
department
and
jacobs
said
it
is
critically
important
for
nws
agencies
to
communicate
information
about
risks
in
a
variety
of
ways
including
through
social
media
it's
also
worth
noting
that
unlike
other
keynote
speeches
at
the
national
weather
association
meeting
including
two
other
addresses
tuesday
jacobs
speech
was
not
livestreamed
on
facebook
the
association
confirmed
that
decision
tuesday
morning
without
offering
an
explanation
jacobs
spent
large
portions
of
his
nearly
minute
speech
commending
the
nws's
work
on
hurricane
dorian
which
he
described
as
a
particularly
tough
storm
to
forecast
up
until
advisory
the
risk
to
the
gulf
states
exceeded
that
in
north
carolina
jacobs
said
but
as
everyone
in
this
room
knows
forecast
models
change
jacobs
did
not
mention
that
the
national
hurricane
center
issued
advisory
around
a
m
et
on
saturday
aug
some
hours
before
president
trump
said
this
via
twitter
in
addition
to
florida
south
carolina
north
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
will
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
looking
like
one
of
the
largest
hurricanes
ever
already
category
the
president's
warning
set
off
alarm
bells
along
the
gulf
coast
where
residents
scrambled
to
find
information
about
the
threat
posed
by
dorian
at
the
nws
office
in
birmingham
calls
began
to
pour
in
people
were
actually
frightened
laws
said
i
mean
they
were
wanting
to
cancel
surgeries
and
they
were
wanting
to
go
pick
up
elderly
parents
at
the
coastline
because
they
were
generally
scared
to
ease
those
fears
laws
said
we
felt
like
we
needed
to
make
a
statement
on
where
the
storm
was
going
to
go
and
to
reassure
our
people
and
that's
what
our
mandate
is
just
minutes
after
trump's
tweet
the
birmingham
office
issued
its
own
tweet
saying
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
on
monday
national
weather
service
director
louis
uccellini
said
at
the
weather
association's
meeting
that
the
birmingham
office
had
acted
only
to
quash
rumors
and
they
responded
not
knowing
where
this
information
was
coming
from
uccellini
said
only
later
when
the
retweets
and
politically
based
comments
came
into
their
office
did
they
learn
the
sources
of
the
disinformation
on
tuesday
jacobs
ended
his
remarks
by
singling
out
the
nws
team
in
birmingham
for
praise
thanking
them
for
the
job
that
you
do
and
for
the
lives
that
you
save
a
sentiment
that
drew
prolonged
applause
at
one
point
in
tuesday's
speech
jacobs
asked
what
did
i
learn
over
the
last
week
from
now
on
the
national
weather
service
should
be
at
the
table
with
emergency
managers
and
fema
at
all
briefings
presumably
referring
to
high-level
briefings
in
washington
calling
it
critically
important
for
the
agency
to
be
represented
when
forecasts
are
being
analyzed
jacobs
said
we
need
somebody
there
who
understands
how
to
interpret
after
jacobs
speech
laws
was
asked
whether
he
still
has
faith
in
the
leadership
at
noaa
absolutely
he
said
