imported
about
billion
worth
of
american
flags
from

last
year
trump
said
the
decision
to
delay
some
tariffs
followed
a
telephone
conversation
with
chinese
officials
on
monday
we
had
a
very
good
talk
yesterday
with
china
trump
said
very
very
productive
call
i
think
they
want
to
do
something
frustrated
with
the
slow
pace
of
trade
talks
trump
had
ordered
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
earlier
this
month
the
move
heightened
trade
tensions
and
triggered
a
sharp
selloff
on
wall
street
investors
and
retailers
welcomed
news
of
the
tariff
delay
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
was
up
nearly
points
in
early
trading
clearly
the
administration
understands
the
importance
of
avoiding
higher
taxes
on
american
families
during
the
holiday
season
said
david
french
senior
vice
president
of
the
national
retail
federation
still
continued
uncertainty
for
u.s.
businesses
and
consumers
is
a
drag
on
the
economy
what
we
really
need
is
an
effective
strategy
to
address
china's
unfair
trade
practices
