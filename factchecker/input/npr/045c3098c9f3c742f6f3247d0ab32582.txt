the

an

not

part
of

is
a

on
the

insurance
plans
those
that
cost
more
than
per
year
for
an
individual
policy
or
for
family
coverage
the
politics
of
health
care
are
changing
and
one
of
the
most
controversial
parts
of
the
affordable
care
act
the
so-called
cadillac
tax
may
be
about
to
change
with
it
the
cadillac
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
most
generous
employer-provided
health
insurance
plans
those
that
cost
more
than
per
year
for
an
individual
policy
or
for
family
coverage
it
was
a
tax
on
employers
and
was
supposed
to
take
effect
in
but
congress
has
delayed
implementation
twice
and
the
house
now
controlled
by
democrats
recently
voted
overwhelmingly
to
repeal
that
part
of
the
aca
entirely
a
senate
companion
bill
is
bipartisan
and
now
has
a
total
of
co-sponsors
more
than
enough
to
ensure
passage
the
tax
was
always
an
unpopular
and
controversial
part
of
the
health
law
because
the
expectation
was
that
employers
would
cut
benefits
to
avoid
the
tax
still
aca
backers
initially
said
the
tax
was
necessary
to
help
pay
for
the
law's
nearly
trillion
cost
and
help
stem
the
use
of
what
was
seen
as
potentially
unnecessary
care
in
the
ensuing
years
however
public
opinion
has
shifted
decisively
as
premiums
and
out-of-pocket
costs
for
patients
have
soared
now
the
biggest
health
issue
is
not
how
much
the
nation
is
spending
on
health
care
but
how
much
individuals
are
voters
deeply
care
about
health
care
still
says
heather
meade
a
spokeswoman
for
the
alliance
to
fight
the
a
coalition
of
business
labor
and
patient
advocacy
groups
urging
repeal
of
the
cadillac
tax
but
it
is
about
their
own
personal
cost
and
their
ability
to
afford
health
care
stan
dorn
a
senior
fellow
at
families
usa
recently
wrote
in
the
journal
health
affairs
that
the
backers
of
the
aca
thought
the
tax
was
necessary
to
sell
the
law
to
people
concerned
about
its
price
tag
and
to
cut
back
on
overly
generous
benefits
that
could
drive
up
health
costs
but
transitions
in
health
care
such
as
the
increasing
use
of
high-deductible
plans
in
the
workplace
make
that
argument
less
compelling
he
said
nowadays
few
observers
would
argue
that
employer-sponsored
insurance
gives
most
workers
and
their
families
excessive
coverage
he
wrote
the
possibility
that
the
tax
might
be
implemented
has
been
casting
a
statutory
shadow
over
million
americans
health
plans
which
we
know
from
hr
administrators
and
employee
reps
in
real
life
has
added
pressure
to
shift
coverage
into
higher-deductible
plans
says
rep
joe
courtney
d-conn
and
that
he
adds
falls
on
the
backs
of
working
americans
support
or
opposition
to
the
cadillac
tax
has
never
broken
down
cleanly
along
party
lines
for
example
economists
from
across
the
ideological
spectrum
supported
its
inclusion
in
the
aca
and
many
continue
to
endorse
it
if
people
have
insurance
that
pays
for
too
much
they
don't
have
enough
skin
in
the
game
they
may
be
too
quick
to
seek
professional
medical
care
they
may
too
easily
accede
when
physicians
recommend
superfluous
tests
and
treatments
wrote
n.
gregory
mankiw
an
economics
adviser
in
the
george

bush
administration
and
lawrence
summers
an
economic
aide
to
president
barack
obama
in
a
column
in
the
new
york
times
such
behavior
can
drive
national
health
spending
beyond
what
is
necessary
and
desirable
at
the
same
time
however
the
tax
has
been
bitterly
opposed
by
organized
labor
a
key
constituency
for
democrats
many
unions
have
been
unable
to
bargain
for
higher
wages
but
they
have
been
taking
more
generous
health
benefits
instead
for
years
says
robert
blendon
a
professor
at
the
harvard
school
of
public
health
who
studies
health
and
public
opinion
now
unions
say
those
benefits
are
disappearing
while
premiums
deductibles
and
other
cost-sharing
moves
are
rising
as
employers
scramble
to
stay
under
the
threshold
for
the
impending
tax
employers
are
using
the
tax
as
justification
to
shift
more
costs
to
employees
raising
costs
for
workers
and
their
families
said
a
letter
to
members
of
congress
from
the
service
employees
international
union
in
july
deductibles
in
health
insurance
plans
have
been
rising
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
possibility
of
the
tax
among
them
according
to
a
survey
by
the
federal
government's
national
center
for
health
statistics
nearly
half
of
americans
under
age
had
high-deductible
health
plans
those
are
plans
that
have
deductibles
of
at
least
for
individual
coverage
or
for
family
coverage
it's
not
yet
clear
whether
the
senate
will
take
up
the
house-passed
bill
or
one
like
it
the
senators
leading
the
charge
in
that
chamber
mike
rounds
r-s
d.
and
martin
heinrich
d-n
m.
have
already
written
to
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
to
urge
him
to
bring
the
bill
to
the
floor
following
the
house's
overwhelming
vote
at
a
time
when
health
care
expenses
continue
to
go
up
and
congress
remains
divided
on
many
issues
the
repeal
of
the
cadillac
tax
is
something
that
has
true
bipartisan
support
their
letter
said
still
there
is
opposition
to
repealing
the
tax
a
letter
to
the
senate
on
july
from
health
care
economists
and
others
argued
that
implementing
it
instead
would
help
curtail
the
growth
of
private
health
insurance
premiums
by
encouraging
employers
to
limit
the
costs
of
plans
to
the
tax-free
amount
that
letter
also
pointed
out
that
repealing
the
tax
would
add
directly
to
the
federal
budget
deficit
an
estimated
billion
over
the
next
decade
according
to
the
joint
committee
on
taxation
if
mcconnell
does
bring
the
bill
up
there
is
little
doubt
it
will
pass
despite
support
for
the
tax
from
economists
and
budget
watchdogs
when
employers
and
employees
agree
in
lockstep
that
they
hate
it
there
are
not
enough
economists
out
there
to
outvote
them
says
former
senate
gop
aide
rodney
whitlock
now
a
health
care
consultant
harvard
professor
blendon
agrees
voters
are
saying
we
want
you
to
lower
our
health
costs
he
says
the
cadillac
tax
at
least
for
those
affected
by
it
would
do
