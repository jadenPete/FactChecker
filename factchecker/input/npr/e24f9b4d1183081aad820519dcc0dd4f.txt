on

it
may
be
strange
for
tourists
to
land
in
hong
kong
to
find
throngs
of
impassioned
protesters
they
might
wonder
what
do
they
expect
me
to
do
about
the
chinese
government
tourists
come
from
all
over
the
world
to
see
the
elegantly
industrious
city-state
it
is
like
a
cauldron
jan
morris
wrote
in
her
book
hong
kong
seething
hissing
hooting
arguing
enmeshed
in
a
labyrinth
of
tunnels
and
overpasses
with
those
skyscrapers
erupting
everywhere
into
view
with
those
ferries
churning
and
hovercraft
splashing
and
great
jets
flying
in
but
there
are
also
visitors
coming
to
hong
kong
from
china's
mainland
they
are
citizens
of
a
country
in
which
they
have
no
political
freedom
and
little
uncensored
information
and
live
under
threat
of
imprisonment
if
they
dissent
they
come
from
the
country
the
hong
kong
protesters
don't
want
to
be
their
future
even
as
they
know
each
day
brings
them
closer
to
when
hong
kong
is
to
be
absorbed
into
the
whole
of
china
president
trump
is
vocal
when
he
decries
china's
trade
policies
china
was
killing
us
with
unfair
trade
deals
he
said
again
this
month
but
he
has
not
raised
his
voice
against
china's
human
rights
crimes
including
the
mass
detention
of
chinese
uighurs
in
reeducation
camps
or
the
widespread
imprisonment
of
political
dissidents
to
be
sure
even
those
u.s.
and
world
leaders
who
criticize
china
about
human
rights
have
been
reluctant
to
risk
losing
any
of
the
lucrative
trade
with
the
country
their
moral
indignation
has
mostly
stayed
rhetorical
but
when
trump
was
asked
about
the
protests
in
hong
kong
this
week
he
once
more
praised
chinese
president
xi
jinping
as
a
very
great
leader
and
called
for
a
happy
and
enlightened
ending
to
the
hong
kong
problem
which
seems
to
say
protesters
are
the
problem
not
china's
increasingly
steely
rule
of
a
place
to
which
it
had
promised
autonomy
for
years
i
think
a
reason
protesters
descended
on
hong
kong's
vast
international
airport
was
to
appeal
personally
to
people
from
all
over
the
world
their
protest
might
have
inconvenienced
tourists
but
it
might
also
pierce
their
conscience
and
make
them
consider
if
china's
vast
wealth
can
buy
the
silence
of
the
world
the
protesters
have
made
a
song
from
les
mis
rables
a
western
musical
their
anthem
as
they
sing
who
will
be
strong
and
stand
with
me
