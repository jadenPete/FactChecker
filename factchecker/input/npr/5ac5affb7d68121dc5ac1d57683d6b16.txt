debates
not
voters
begin
sending
democratic
presidential
candidates
packing
the
current
tally
of
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
is
enough
to
set
a
record
in
any
previous
primary
season
but
even
with
the
giant
number
of
candidates
the
reality
is
that
the
winnowing
has
already
begun
the
field
is
shrinking
slowly
but
what's
different
this
time
compared
to
past
campaigns
is
what's
driving
candidates
to
pack
it
in
here's
what
it's
not
voters
iowa
really
isn't
the
first
winnowing
process
in
the
primary
anymore
said
brad
anderson
a
veteran
iowa
campaign
operative
it's
now
the
debates
he
argues
this
next
debate
which
has
essentially
halved
the
field
at
least
for
one
night
is
really
the
first
contest
anderson
said
the
iowa
caucuses
on
feb
will
still
be
the
first
time
actual
voters
will
weigh
in
followed
by
the
new
hampshire
primary
on
feb
those
will
inevitably
shrink
the
field
drastically
as
usual
but
the
weeding
out
isn't
waiting
until
then
because
of
the
new
tightened
criteria
for
the
democratic
presidential
debates
instituted
by
the
national
party
the
more
rigorous
standards
in
at
least
four
polls
and
unique
donors
across
states
and
at
least
in
each
state
have
forced
multiple
democratic
candidates
to
face
the
music
five
candidates
who
would
not
clear
that
pair
of
hurdles
to
be
eligible
to
join
those
big
debates
on
cable
television
have
dropped
out
debates
are
a
place
to
boost
a
campaign
with
a
big
moment
in
front
of
a
big
tv
audience
but
this
time
they
are
also
practically
functioning
as
gatekeepers
in
the
process
it's
simple
really
anderson
said
if
you
do
not
make
that
dnc
debate
stage
you
are
not
a
part
of
the
national
conversation
anymore
and
if
you're
not
part
of
the
national
conversation
the
downward
spiral
takes
hold
you
can't
rise
in
the
polls
which
makes
it
even
harder
to
raise
money
which
means
your
campaign
has
no
oxygen

sen
michael

went
so
far
as
to
say
the
democratic
national
committee
is
in
fact
stifling
debate
and
he
said
that
on

right
in

of
dnc
chairman
tom
perez
former
montana
gov
steve
bullock
has
been
outspoken
about
the
rules
too
he
said
they
have
turned
the
primary
into
the
hunger
games
contended
that
they
are
hurting
governors
like
himself
and
gov
jay
inslee
of

state
who
dropped
out
and
benefiting
people
with
money
like
tom
steyer
a
billionaire
venture
capitalist
steyer
did
not
qualify
for
the
september
debate
but
he
is
close
to
qualifying
for
the
october
one
he
spent
million
on
ads
which
helped
raise
his
name
identification
and
gather
the
donors
needed
he
just
needs
one
more
poll
to
show
him
at
to
qualify
for
the
next
debate
we're
kidding
ourselves
if
we're
calling
a
million
purchase
of
donors
a
demonstration
of
grassroots
support
bullock
said
in
a
statement
it's
not
serving
the
candidates
and
it
sure
isn't
helping
the
voters
who
will
actually
decide
this
election
in
response
dnc
war
room
director
adrienne
watson
noted
the
debate
rules
have
been
public
for
months
and
candidates
have
been
given
more
opportunities
and
more
time
to
qualify
for

howard
dean
a
former
dnc
chairman
and
presidential
candidate
defended
the
committee's
rules
it's
controversial
and
everybody
complains
because
the
stakes
are
so
high
when
they're
not
doing
well
dean
said
but
he
added
i
think
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
figure
out
how
you
can
bring
some
sort
of
order
otherwise
he
argues
you'd
have
two
dozen
candidates
heading
into
the
iowa
caucuses
which
would
make
even
the
logistics
of
the
event
difficult
avoiding
the
downward
spiral
for
the
first
two
rounds
of
debates
the
qualification
thresholds
were
half
as
rigorous
so
the
stage
was
jam-packed
with
candidates
per
night
over
two
separate
nights
that
made
for
total
candidates
a
cornucopia
of
candidates
for
some
voters
though
it
was
an
overabundance
for
months
democratic
voters
at
campaign
events
have
said
they
are
undecided
and
think
there
are
too
many
candidates
it's
a
lot
of
work
jake
poorman
of
iowa
told
the
ap
of
his
effort
to
get
each
of
the
candidates
to
sign
a
commemorative
baseball
he's
gotten
to
sign
so
far
and
already
had
to
get
another
ball
because
they
didn't
all
fit
there's
starting
to
be
a
bit
of
fatigue
other
democrats
worry
that
the
infighting
will
help
president
trump's
chances
of
being
reelected
so
this
week's
debate
has
served
the
purpose
of
slicing
down
the
field
of
candidates
with
only
making
the
cut
of
those
not
in
five
saw
the
writing
on
the
wall
and
dropped
out
ahead
of
the
deadline
to
qualify
the
dropouts
so
far
are
inslee
as
well
as
sen
kirsten
gillibrand

new
york
former
gov
john
hickenlooper
of
colorado
rep
seth
moulton
of
massachusetts
and
rep

swalwell

most
now
go
back
to
their
old
jobs

though
is
challenging
colorado
sen
cory
gardner
who's
among
the
most
vulnerable
gop
incumbents
in
here's
his
first
video
in
the
race
in
search
of
a
viral
moment
the
increased
influence
of
the
debates
has
meant
the
candidates
need
to
essentially
run
two
campaigns
at
once
they
need
to
show
up
in
living
rooms
in
union
halls
and
at
parades
and
labor
day
picnics
in
the
early
voting
states
iowa
new
hampshire
nevada
and
south
carolina
but
they
also
need
to
establish
a
national
presence
in
order
to
compete
for
donors
and
to
demonstrate
support
in
the
polls
that
help
them
qualify
for
the
debates
if
done
right
one
strategy
can
help
the
other
have
a
big
moment
on
cable
tv
for
example
like
the
one
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
did
in
a
cnn
town
hall
when
he
challenged
vice
president
pence's
version
of
christianity
how
could
he
allow
himself
to
become
the
cheerleader
of
the
porn
star
presidency
buttigieg
said
of
his
fellow
hoosier
is
it
that
he
stopped
believing
in
scripture
when
he
started
believing
in
donald
trump
the
audience
in
the
theater
roared
its
approval
but
more
importantly
for
buttigieg
the
moment
went
viral
on
social
media
as
he
result
an
early
visit
to
des
moines
iowa
that
was
expected
to
draw
maybe
to
people
drew
more
than
prior
to
that
buttigieg
was
little
known
since
then
he's
been
in
the
top
five
of
the
democratic
field
though
he's
faded
from
his
boom
after
that
town
hall
because
of
a
controversy
back
in
his
hometown
over
race
and
policing
a
moment
that
spreads
to
facebook
pages
and
smartphones
everywhere
can
make
campaign
cash
registers
ring
fueling
small
donations
from
supporters
that
happened
for
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
after
a
breakout
moment
in
the
very
first
debate
she
directly
took
on
front-runner
joe
biden
on
his
past
opposition
to
busing
to
integrate
public
schools
harris
got
a
bump
in
the
polls
and
in
fundraising
but
she
too
has
had
a
hard
time
sustaining
both
in
the
months
since
it's
going
to
be
a
little
loud
right
now
this
year's
democratic
race
highlights
a
generational
divide
within
the
party
it's
evident
on
the
debate
stage
among
candidates
that
range
in
age
from
buttigieg
to
sanders
and
it's
also
clear
with
voters
at
rallies
they
are
visual
reminders
of
how
the
democratic
party
has
greater
diversity
across
age
and
racial
lines
than
the
gop
but
it
also
can
make
for
some
disagreements
if
not
on
direction
but
on
policy
boldness
and
tactics
including
whether
the
party
should
tip
the
scales
to
shrink
the
number
of
candidates
i
think
we've
got
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
it's
going
to
be
a
little
loud
right
now
said
jessica
byrd
a
democratic
campaign
strategist
who
runs
the
firm
three
point
strategies
she's
one
of
those
younger
voices
emerging
as
a
force
in
the
party
she
argues
the
dnc
should
not
be
taking
steps
to
shrink
the
size
of
the
presidential
field
before
voters
get
their
say
byrd
who
started
volunteering
on
campaigns
when
she
was
a
year-old
growing
up
in
ohio
said
she
thinks
a
larger
field
is
a
good
thing
she
believes
it
would
pay
off
in
the
long
run
to
hear
ideas
from
more
people
because
it
will
energize
voters
come
november
and
they'll
feel
like
they
got
a
fair
shot
what
it's
allowing
us
to
do
is
to
build
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
voices
into
the
process
by
giving
them
a
person
to
cheer
for
she
said
and
if
that
means
a
crowded
debate
stage
or
ballot
in
her
view
so
be
it
the
flip
side
to
that
is
the
risk
the
party
doesn't
fully
unify
around
and
be
excited
to
vote
for
whoever
becomes
the
eventual
nominee
either
way
because
of
the
debates
in
large
measure
by
the
time
the
first
votes
are
cast
the
field
will
be
smaller
than
it
is
now
and
for
as
much
that
has
changed
the
democratic
primary
contest
dean
notes
i
think
still
think
that
iowa
new
hampshire
south
carolina
and
nevada
are
going
to
be
key
places
