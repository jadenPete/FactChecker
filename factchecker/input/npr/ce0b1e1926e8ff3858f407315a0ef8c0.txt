of

a
difficult
choice
seeing
trump's
event
at
the
ethane
cracker
plant
operated
by
royal
dutch
shell
in

i'll
tell
ya
what
broadbent

do
photo
ops
all

is
industry

for
a
facility
that
converts
oil
and

into
tiny
pellets
that
can
be
used
in
plastic
products
when
construction
is
complete
and
the
plant
is
operational
in
the
coming
years
it
is
expected
to
employ
about
permanent
workers
shell
spokesman
curtis
smith
said
the
company
did
not
write
the
notice
to
workers
broadbent
said
it
was
devised
by
a
construction
site
contractor
which
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
smith
said
if
workers
chose
not
to
attend
the
president's
speech
they
had
the
option
to
either
stay
home
without
pay
or
take
a
paid-time-off
day
missing
a
day
of
work
could
amount
to
in
pay
benefits
and
a
per
diem
payment
that
out-of-town
workers
receive
a
union
leader
told
the
pittsburgh
post-gazette
tuesday
was
treated
as
a
training
work
day
with
a
guest
speaker
who
happened
to
be
the
president
smith
told
npr
in
a
statement
it
was
understood
some
would
choose
not
to
attend
the
presidential
visit
and
were
given
the
option
to
take
paid
time
off
pto
instead
the
memo
which
was
first
reported
by
the
post-gazette
instructed
workers
to
show
up
at
a
m
scan
their
id
cards
and
stand
for
hours
through
lunch
workers
were
told
not
to
shout
protest
or
do
anything
that
could
be
viewed
as
resistance
the
newspaper
reported
trump's
visit
was
an
official
white
house
event
not
a
speech
connected
to
the
president's
reelection
campaign
in
the
talk
trump
applauded
natural
gas
extraction
across
appalachia
you're
sitting
on
gold
and
we're
taking
advantage
of
it
trump
said
the
president
told
workers
at
the
plant
one
of
the
largest
construction
sites
in
the
united
states
that
he
was
depending
on
their
votes
in
i'm
going
to
speak
to
some
of
your
union
leaders
to
say
i
hope
you're
going
to
support
trump
ok
trump
said
and
if
they
don't
vote
them
the
hell
out
of
office
because
they're
not
doing
their
job
to
broadbent
the
union
business
manager
any
politician
willing
to
fight
for
more
jobs
is
something
his
members
can
support
we
back
politicians
whether
republican
or
democrat
who
help
create
jobs
that's
the
most
important
thing
it
gives
us
health
coverage
it
gives
us
pension
vehicles
it
gives
people
a
middle-class
way
of
life
so
the
building
trades
and
the
steamfitters
are
pro-jobs
broadbent
said
trump
won
beaver
county
a
largely
agricultural
region
about
miles
north
of
pittsburgh
in
with
roughly
of
the
vote
