bank's
manager
of
public
programs
says
she
and
her
colleagues
are
at
the
state
fair
to
teach
minnesotans
about
what
the
fed
does
beyond
the
cattle
barn
the
oink
booth
the
haunted
house
and
meat-on-a
stick
the
minnesota
state
fair
has
a
new
attraction
this
year
tucked
away
in
the
education
building
at
the
fairgrounds
near
st
paul
is
an
exhibit
featuring
something
anybody
would
love
free
dough
how
often
do
you
get
free
money
genuine
u.s.
currency
shouted
karmi
mattson
who
manages
public
programs
for
the
minneapolis
federal
reserve
bank
which
set
up
its
first-ever
booth
at
the
fair
sound
too
good
to
be
true
yup
it's
not
spendable
cash
that
the
fed's
giving
away
it's
shredded
worn-out
money
the
bank
has
taken
out
of
circulation
at
the
fair
which
attracted
more
than
million
visitors
last
year
the
minneapolis
fed
is
helping
introduce
the
bank
to
thousands
of
minnesotans
at
a
time
many
people
are
concerned
about
the
economy
we
know
that
a
lot
of
folks
out
there
don't
understand
the
mission
of
the
fed
and
all
of
our
many
activities
so
we're
just
hear
to
raise
a
little
bit
of
awareness
mattson
said
fed
officials
get
questions
like
is
now
a
good
time
to
refinance
my
house
visitors
to
the
fair
booth
learn
that
the
federal
reserve
system
of
which
the
minneapolis
fed
is
just
a
part
sets
interest
rates
manages
the
currency
including
destroying
worn
bills
and
oversees
banks
one
visitor
peter
andersen
of
st
paul
learned
the
federal
reserve
system
is
divided
into
twice
as
many
districts
as
the
six
he
thought
existed
unlike
president
trump
who's
likened
fed
chairman
jay
powell
to
an
enemy
andersen
has
a
favorable
opinion
of
the
central
bank
and
its
mission
they
monitor
money
and
they
watch
interest
rates
and
watch
over
the
economy
and
make
sure
the
inflation
is
not
overdone
andersen
said
i
think
they
do
a
good
job
and
they
need
to
remain
separate
the
president
should
not
in
my
opinion
have
any
influence
on
the
fed
in
addition
to
getting
a
free
bag
of
finely
shredded
currency
visitors
to
the
fed
booth
can
spin
a
big
trivia
wheel
for
a
chance
to
win
a
fed
fanny
pack
maggie
catambay
landed
on
a
question
about
the
average
daily
value
of
the
electronic
transfers
the
fed
handles
for
banks
the
wheel
offered
three
options
billion
billion
and
billion
catambay
went
with
the
largest
figure
the
correct
answer
she
too
said
she
has
no
beef
with
the
fed
she
thinks
trump's
attacks
on
the
central
bank
for
not
lowering
interest
rates
more
are
for
personal
reasons
it's
ridiculous
it's
all
about
trump
and
trump's
money
and
trump's
debts
catambay
said
she
said
it's
a
good
idea
for
the
minneapolis
bank
to
raise
its
profile
with
a
fair
booth
you
can
never
have
enough
information
she
said
mattson
said
catambay
and
andersen
are
typical
of
visitors
she
said
she
and
her
colleagues
are
not
getting
any
pushback
from
fairgoers
we're
seeing
quite
the
opposite
a
lot
of
support

said
people
thanking
us
for
what
we
do
thanking
us
for
being
here
