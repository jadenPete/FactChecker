austria's
youngest-ever
chancellor
year-old
sebastian
kurz
is
poised
to
reclaim
his
job
after
his
party
received
its
biggest
victory
in
years
according
to
partial
results
of
parliamentary
elections
his
conservative
austrian
people's
party
received
more
than
percent
of
the
vote
five
percentage
points
higher
than
its
showing
in
when
it
teamed
up
with
the
far-right
freedom
party
to
form
a
government
it's
been
a
difficult
four
months
but
today
the
people
have
chosen
us
again
kurz
told
a
crowd
of
cheering
supporters
i'm
rarely
at
a
loss
for
words
but
i'm
practically
speechless
we
didn't
expect
such
a
result
kurz's
first
government
came
crashing
down
in
may
after
his
coalition
partner
the
freedom
party
became
embroiled
in
a
cash-for-contracts
scandal
the
conservatives
do
not
have
enough
seats
to
govern
alone
so
they
will
need
a
coalition
partner
kurz
could
team
up
with
the
green
party
which
won
percent
of
the
vote
a
significant
improvement
from
when
it
failed
to
get
enough
votes
to
enter
parliament
he
could
also
team
up
again
with
the
freedom
party
which
saw
its
support
drop
t
percent
percent
lower
than
kurz
might
consider
reuniting
with
the
far-right
party
because
it's
very
good
at
being
in
opposition
which
creates
headaches
for
mr
kurz
says
reinhard
heinisch
a
professor
of
comparative
politics
at
the
university
of
salzburg
but
the
freedom
party
is
also
very
problematic
kurz
invited
the
freedom
party
into
his
government
in
with
the
intention
of
taming
its
worst
tendencies
the
party
is
known
in
austria
for
populist
rhetoric
that
vilifies
migrants
and
muslims
it
has
ties
to
radical
right
extremist
groups
like
generation
identity
which
has
links
with
the
christchurch
terrorist
who
murdered
people
at
two
mosques
in
new
zealand
in
march
instead
the
partnership
was
an
month
roller-coaster
of
disturbing
headlines
about
the
far-right
party's
links
to
the
kremlin
a
deeply
anti-semitic
songbook
and
a
poem
likening
migrants
to
rats
the
final
straw
for
kurz
came
in
may
his
vice
chancellor
heinz-christian
strache
then
freedom
party
leader
was
forced
to
resign
after
the
german
magazine
der
spiegel
obtained
and
published
a
video
from
which
was
filmed
secretly
as
part
of
a
sting
showing
him
spending
a
boozy
evening
on
the
spanish
island
of
ibiza
with
a
woman
posing
as
the
niece
of
a
rich
russian
close
to
the
kremlin
in
the
video
strache
offers
the
woman
government
contracts
if
she
supports
the
freedom
party
enough
is
enough
kurz
said
then
strache
resigned
the
freedom
party
left
the
government
and
kurz
lost
a
no-confidence
vote
in
parliament
a
caretaker
government
led
by
former
supreme
court
judge
brigitte
bierlein
the
first
female
chancellor
in
history
has
run
the
country
all
summer
with
a
quiet
competence
that's
won
her
admiration
people
like
having
a
government
that's
not
always
in
the
media
heinisch
says
scrutiny
of
an
unabashedly
nationalist
party
the
freedom
party
has
made
headlines
for
years
most
recently
partly
because
of
the
ibiza
video
its
ties
to
russia
have
come
under
scrutiny
while
austria
has
warm
ties
with
russia
the
freedom
party
openly
admires
the
kremlin
raising
eyebrows
in
the
nato-supporting
west
it's
in
our
interests
to
have
a
balanced
worldwide
network
of
allies
and
not
to
be
a
u.s.
colony
says
johannes
huebner
a
longtime
freedom
party
member
during
an
interview
in
june
the
thing
is
in
europe
there
is
overwhelming
u.s.
influence
through
nato
through
the
control
of
the
financial
system
through
the
media
through
the
entertainment
industry
like
other
radical
right
parties
they
also
oppose
immigration
and
are
unabashedly
nationalist
which
means
something
in
austria
the
birthplace
of
adolf
hitler
many
in
the
freedom
party
see
the
defeat
of
nazi
germany
not
as
a
victory
for
democracy
but
as
a
defeat
for
their
cause
heinisch
says
hitler
annexed
the
country
in
but
austria
did
not
go
through
the
same
process
of
post-war
re-education
as
germany
there
was
an
anti-nazi
political
consensus
in
the
years
after
but
there
was
never
a
consensus
that
you
cannot
cooperate
politically
with
the
far
right
says
bernhard
weidinger
at
the
documentation
center
for
the
austrian
resistance
in
vienna
so
the
two
big
parties
the
center-right
people's
party
and
the
social
democrats
they've
always
been
flirting
with
the
far
right
and
that
of
course
contributed
massively
to
normalize
policies
of
this
party
co-opting
an
anti-migrant
message
sunday's
election
results
show
that
the
ibiza
scandal
hurt
the
party
more
than
expected
public
opinion
polls
had
showed
about
one
in
five
austrians
supporting
the
party
one
is
retired
it
administrator
kurt
blind
who
runs
a
monthly
meeting
of
party
faithful
at
a
beer-and-schnitzel
restaurant
in
vienna
we
may
not
have
as
many
members
as
the
other
parties
yet
he
said
in
an
interview
in
june
but
each
month
we
grow
the
party
had
won
support
with
its
anti-migrant
rhetoric
polished
in
when
a
million
asylum-seekers
and
migrants
arrived
in
europe
kurz
rose
to
prominence
in
austrian
politics
by
trying
co-opt
that
hardline
rhetoric
and
serve
it
up
through
his
clean-cut
millennial
blandness
as
a
way
to
make
it
more
palatable
says
nina
horaczek
an
investigative
reporter
at
the
austrian
weekly
falter
who
co-wrote
a
biography
of
kurz
he
did
not
understand
that
repeating
hardline
anti-immigrant
rhetoric
in
a
nicer
tone
does
not
defeat
far-right
populists
she
says
it
makes
them
stronger
the
freedom
party's
influence
was
most
obvious
in
migration
policy
the
government
cut
benefits
for
migrant
families
banned
headscarves
in
elementary
schools
and
threatened
to
force
new
asylum-seekers
to
work
for
less
than
an
hour
dormitories
housing
asylum-seekers
were
renamed
departure
centers
in
the
town
of
traiskirchen
just
outside
vienna
afghan
asylum-seeker
daoud
saidi
got
the
message
i'm
not
wanted
here
he
says
i
told
the
austrian
authorities
that
the
taliban
took
over
my
village
and
that
it's
not
safe
they
told
me
i
had
to
leave
austria
can
the
freedom
party
reconcile
with
kurz
the
caretaker
government
axed
the
departure
center
signs
and
cancelled
plans
to
pay
new
asylum-seekers
sweatshop
wages
migration
is
not
the
top
issue
in
this
election
austrians
are
nowadays
more
interested
in
issues
such
as
climate
change
but
the
freedom
party
still
brings
it
up
on
the
issue
of
immigration
the
freedom
party
has
posters
saying
mr
kurz
is
learning
from
us
says
heinisch
the
politics
professor
in
salzburg
as
media
have
speculated
that
kurz
might
team
up
with
the
greens
which
is
pro-migration
in
a
new
coalition
government
the
freedom
party
has
told
voters
that
if
they
stay
home
that
means
the
conservatives
are
going
to
do
a
deal
with
the
greens
and
then
they'll
throw
the
borders
open
the
immigrants
will
pour
in
heinisch
says
the
slogan
that
the
freedom
party
is
posting
is
we
need
to
be
strong
so
we
can
keep
the
conservatives
on
the
right
path
for
the
freedom
party
that
means
reconciling
with
kurz
who
remains
popular
he's
no
longer
the
messianic
figure
of
austrian
politics
he
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
heinisch
says
but
he's
handsome
he's
rhetorically
gifted
he's
young
and
to
a
lot
of
conservatives
represents
the
future
there's
even
a
campaign
commercial
showing
the
new
freedom
party
leader
norbert
hofer
in
couples
therapy
with
an
actor
portraying
kurz
the
men
tell
a
therapist
how
much
they
like
and
respect
each
other
and
how
they
share
ideas
they
sometimes
answer
questions
in
unison
we
have
so
much
in
common
hofer
says
in
the
video
we
just
need
a
little
push
to
get
back
together
