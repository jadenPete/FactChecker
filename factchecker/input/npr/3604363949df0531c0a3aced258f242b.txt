last

senators
thawed
a
long-frozen
dispute
over
election
security
this
week
with
an
agreement
to
provide
more
funding
ahead
of
election
day
next
year
but
not
as
much
as
some
democrats
and
outside
activists
say
is
necessary
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
agreed
to
add
million
for
election
security
after
having
held
up
earlier
legislation
the
money
will
be
used
by
the
federal
government
and
the
states
he
said
and
in
a
way
that
mcconnell
argues
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
system
and
without
unreasonable
new
mandates
from
congress
the
trump
administration
has
made
enormous
strides
to
help
states
secure
their
elections
without
giving
washington
new
power
to
push
the
states
around
mcconnell
said
that's
how
we
continue
the
progress
we
saw
in
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
doing
the
majority
leader
had
objected
to
what
he
called
a
washington
takeover
of
elections
that
he
said
was
contained
in
earlier
proposals
for
a
time
it
appeared
that
mcconnell
would
permit
no
movement
on
any
legislation
after
holding
up
earlier
legislation

after

senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
agreed
to
million
for
election
security
that
prompted
months
of
hectoring
by
democrats
activists
and
others
ranging
from
teases
about
moscow
mitch
in
part
because
he
was
ostensibly
helping
russia
interfere
in
another
u.s.
election
to
calls
for
action
from
some
of
the
majority
leader's
own
ideological
allies
critics
say
it's
not
enough
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
welcomed
the
million
allocation
but
said
it
isn't
enough
and
democrats
maintained
their
support
for
what
they
called
comprehensive
bipartisan
election
security
legislation
that
would
include
changes
to
policy
proposals
include
a
mandate
that
every
ballot
in
the
united
states
have
a
paper
backup
requiring
campaigns
to
report
contacts
with
foreign
officials
automatic
sanctions
for
nations
that
interfere
in
elections
and
more
although
officials
at
every
level
in
the
united
states
have
worked
to
improve
election
security
since
the
election
which
was
attacked
systematically
by
russian
active
measures
millions
of
americans
in
are
still
expected
to
vote
using
machines
with
no
paper
record
or
other
potential
insecurities
marian
k.
schneider
president
of
verified
voting
which
supports
further
changes
to
u.s.
elections
said
mcconnell's
support
for
the
additional
funding
was
better
than
nothing
but
she
underscored
how
much
more
she
said
must
be
done
this
amount
falls
short
of
the
million
that
passed
in
the
house
which
is
much
closer
to
meeting
the
need
for
proper
investment
in
election
security
she
said
congress
has
the
obligation
to
protect
the
country
from
threats
to
national
security
and
has
the
opportunity
to
act
on
this
nonpartisan
issue
after
all
everyone
votes
on
the
same
equipment
larry
norden
director
of
the
electoral
reform
program
at
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
new
york
university
said
he
hoped
that
members
of
congress
would
build
on
the
consensus
reached
for
this
agreement
about
more
funding
to
also
incorporate
some
policy
changes
the
house
funding
bill
provides
more
money
than
offered
by
the
senate
and
includes
parameters
on
spending
to
ensure
the
most
critical
election
security
priorities
are
addressed
first
like
replacing
paperless
voting
machines
and
implementing
audits
that
check
electronic
results
with
paper
records
of
votes
he
said
norden
said
lawmakers
should
now
try
to
get
elements
like
that
into
law
along
with
the
approval
for
the
additional
money
as
both
chambers
negotiate
a
final
spending
bill
it's
heartening
to
see
bipartisan
agreement
that
more
resources
are
needed
now
for
election
security
now
they
must
do
the
work
to
get
the
final
bill
done
right
threats
expected
to
endure
national
security
officials
have
said
they
expect
active
measures
to
return
in
the
election
and
that
foreign
interference
in
the
u.s.
information
environment
never
truly
stopped
after
worries
include
more
disinformation
or
agitation
on
social
media
cyberattacks
against
political
targets
and
the
prospect
for
interference
with
voter
databases
election
machines
or
other
systems
chris
krebs
director
of
the
cybersecurity
and
infrastructure
security
agency
which
operates
within
the
department
of
homeland
security
said
the
work
in
the
senate
was
a
good
start
but
said
that
election
security
would
be
an
ongoing
issue
for
the
united
states
what
state
and
local
election
supervisors
need
he
said
is
a
regular
stream
of
support
not
one-time
periodic
infusions
of
cash
the
thing
they
want
is
consistency
something
they
can
set
their
budget
clocks
to
said
krebs
if
the
federal
government
is
going
to
play
in
this
space
we
have
to
be
dependable
partners
