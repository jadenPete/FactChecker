urged
the
israeli
leader
on
twitter
to
block
reps
ilhan

been
vocal
critics
of
the
israeli
government
and
trump's
unwavering
support
of
netanyahu
they
also
voted
against
a
nonbinding

condemning
a
palestinian-led
movement
calling
for
boycotts
divestment
and
sanctions
in
israel
which
they
have
repeatedly
defended
tlaib

racist
policies
israeli
law
bars
visits
by
people
who
support
the
global
boycott
movement
against
israel
over
its
treatment
of
the
palestinians
israel
says
the
boycott
challenges
the
country's
legitimacy
but
as
recently
as
last
month
israeli
ambassador
ron
dermer
said
tlaib
and
omar
would
be
allowed
to
visit
israel
out
of
respect
for
the
u.s.
congress
and
the
great
alliance
between
israel
and
america
in
a
statement
thursday
netanyahu
said
they
planned
a
visit
whose
sole
objective
is
to
strengthen
the
boycott
against
us
and
deny
israel's
legitimacy
miftah
the

that

trip
called
the
ban
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
and
hostility
based
on
political
views
and
ethnic
background
deserving
of
moral
indignation
and
unequivocal
condemnation
in
palestine
and
the
united
states
officials
said
they
had
worked
hard
to
organize
a
well-rounded
visit
for
the
congresswomen
as
well
as
rep
stacey
plakett
d-virgin
islands
in
order
to
facilitate
their
engagement
with
palestinian
civil
society
and
to
provide
them
with
an
opportunity
to
see
the
reality
of
occupation
for
themselves
omar
tweeted
thursday
afternoon
that
trump's
muslim
ban
is
what
israel
is
implementing
this
time
against
two
duly
elected
members
of
congress
trump
has
singled
out
the
representatives
in
the
past
as
part
of
his
accusation
that
democrats
are
anti-israel
and
anti-semitic
the
president
ignited
a
massive
controversy
last
month
after
he
lashed
out
tlaib
and
omar
as
well
as
freshman
reps
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
ayanna
pressley
tweeting
that
they
should
go
back
to
where
they
came
from
and
that
he
doesn't
believe
they
are
capable
of
loving
the
country
several
pro-israel
groups
promptly
criticized
israel's
decision
including
j
street
president
jeremy
ben-ami
called
it
dangerous
unacceptable
and
wrong
as
sitting
members
of
congress
representing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
americans
in
their
districts
reps
omar
and
tlaib
have
the
same
right
as
every
one
of
their
colleagues
to
visit
israel
and
the
occupied
palestinian
territory
ben-ami
said
in
a
statement
democratic
speaker
of
the
house
nancy
pelosi
said
in
a
statement
she
was
deeply
saddened
by
the
news
and
prays
that
the
government
of
israel
will
reverse
its
denial
israel's
denial
of
entry
to
congresswomen
tlaib
and
omar
is
a
sign
of
weakness
and
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
great
state
of
israel
pelosi
wrote
the
president's
statements
about
the
congresswomen
are
a
sign
of
ignorance
and
disrespect
and
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
office
of
the
president
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
said
in
a
statement
that
israel's
decision
is
outrageous
regardless
of
the
itinerary
or
their
views
he
said
discussions
are
underway
that
could
allow
tlaib
to
visit
relatives
in
the

it
would
consider
if
she
reapplied
for
a
personal
visit
