walmart
is
going

to
its

heritage
and
getting
rid
of
anything
that's

this

walmart
is
dramatically
cutting
back
sales
of
ammunition
and
asking
shoppers
to
refrain
from
openly
carrying
firearms
in
its
stores
these
are
a
few
of
the
changes
walmart
is
making
to
its
gun-sales
policy
following
two
shootings
a
month
ago
at
two
walmart
stores
within
one
week
as
a
company
we
experienced
two
horrific
events
in
one
week
and
we
will
never
be
the
same

ceo

mcmillon
wrote
to
employees
on
tuesday
walmart
has
been
in
the
middle
of
the
gun-policy
debate
as
it
faces
new
calls
to
tighten
sales
of
guns
and
ammunition
a
month
ago
people
were
killed
in
a
shooting
at
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
an
incident
that's
being
treated
as
domestic
terrorism
and
four
days
earlier
a
disgruntled
employee
killed
two
walmart
workers
in
southaven
miss
it's
clear
to
us
that
the
status
quo
is
unacceptable
mcmillon
wrote
in
tuesday's
memo
it
marks
one
of
the
strongest
statements
from
walmart
the
powerful
largest
retailer
in
the
u.s.
walmart
plans
to
stop
selling
ammunition
for
handguns
and
short-barrel
rifles
which
are
commonly
used
for
hunting
but
they
can
also
be
used
with
military-style
weapons
walmart
will
also
phase
out
the
sale
of
handguns
in
the
only
state
where
it
still
sells
them
alaska
walmart
says
its
current
market
share
in
ammunition
is
about
and
the
new
cutbacks
will
reduce
its
profile
in
that
market
to
around
to
the
retailer
is
also
asking
shoppers
to
refrain
from
openly
carrying
guns
in
its
stores
even
if
cities
and
states
allow
guns
in
stores
unless
they're
authorized
law
enforcement
officers
we
know
these
decisions
will
inconvenience
some
of
our
customers
and
we
hope
they
will
understand
mcmillon
wrote
adding
that
walmart's
retail
focus
will
now
shift
further
to
the
needs
of
hunting
and
sport
shooting
enthusiasts
the
moves
are
the
most
far-reaching
move
by
walmart
since
the
el
paso
shooting
which
prompted
loud
calls
from
gun-control
advocates
democratic
politicians
and
some
shoppers
and
employees
for
the
retailer
to
stop
all
gun
sales
last
month
walmart
instructed
workers
to
take
down
displays
of
video
games
with
violent
imagery
and
make
sure
none
of
the
screens
in
stores
display
violence
walmart's
most
significant
decision
on
gun
sales
came
in
when
the
retailer
quietly
stopped
selling
military-style
or
assault-style
rifles
the
retailer
cited
weak
sales
last
year
walmart
also
stopped
selling
guns
and
ammunition
to
people
younger
than
on
the
same
day
when
dick's
sporting
goods
announced
that
it
would
stop
selling
military-style
rifles
and
end
sales
of
guns
and
ammo
those
under
at
the
time
dick's
took
a
political
stand
on
the
issue
with
ceo
ed
stack
calling
for
common-sense
reforms
stricter
background
checks
and
other
changes
to
gun
laws
the
shooter
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
parkland
fla
had
purchased
a
different
gun
not
used
in
the
shooting
at
dick's
on
tuesday
walmart's
mcmillon
said
that
he's
also
writing
to
congress
and
the
white
house
urging
action
on
common
sense
measures
he
called
for
more
debate
on
the
re-authorization
of
the
assault-weapons
ban
we
encourage
our
nation's
leaders
to
move
forward
and
strengthen
background
checks
and
to
remove
weapons
from
those
who
have
been
determined
to
pose
an
imminent
danger
he
wrote
as
we've
seen
before
these
horrific
events
occur
and
then
the
spotlight
fades
we
should
not
allow
that
to
happen
