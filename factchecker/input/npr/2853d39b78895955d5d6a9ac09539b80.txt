presidential
campaign
season
the
fate
of
the
filibuster
a
vote
threshold
for
most
legislation
in
the
u.s.
senate
is
again
an
issue
of
controversy
among
democratic
presidential
candidates
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
said
the
supermajority
requirement
is
preventing
congress
from
passing
popular
bills
such
as
a
background
check
bill
we
have
a
congress
that
is
beholden
to
the
gun
industry
said
warren
during
thursday
night's
debate
and
unless
we're
willing
to
address
that
head-on
and
roll
back
the
filibuster
we're
not
going
to
get
anything
done
on
guns
i
was
in
the
united
states
senate
when
senators
said
let's
do
background
checks
let's
get
rid
of
assault
weapons
and
with
senators
it
failed
because
of
the
filibuster
speaking
immediately
after
her
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
rejected
ending
the
filibuster
but
also
said
he
would
not
wait
for
votes
to
pass
priorities
of
his
such
as
medicare
for
all
or
climate
change
legislation
instead
he
suggested
existing
parliamentary
tactics
to
get
bills
through
congress
without
being
filibustered
but
warren's
argument
is
one
that
many
liberals
have
become
attuned
to
after
seeing
how
effectively
now-senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
wielded
the
filibuster
when
he
was
minority
leader
during
much
of
barack
obama's
presidency
many
progressive
activists
fear
that
a
lot
of
the
ideas
democrats
have
been
debating
won't
actually
become
law
if
a
democrat
becomes
president
in
unless
the
party
either
has
of
the
senate's
seats
an
impossibly
tall
order
or
changes
the
chamber's
rules
to
make
it
easier
to
pass
bills
without
the
cooperation
of
the
other
party
here's
how
npr's
ron
elving
explained
the
filibuster
in
in
the
modern
era
the
filibuster
has
been
used
at
record
rates
making
almost
nothing
passable
without
votes
as
npr
reported
in
a
number
of
democratic
presidential
candidates
want
to
get
rid
of
the
filibuster
although
warren
is
the
only
senator
who
embraces
the
idea
and
it's
a
rare
idea
that
president
trump
agrees
with
them
on
having
experienced
his
own
frustrations
trying
to
get
bills
through
congress
only
to
see
them
die
in
the
senate
despite
receiving
majority
support
but
many
long-serving
lawmakers
disagree
warning
that
a
no-holds-barred
approach
would
take
hold
in
the
senate
and
that
the
minority
could
block
nothing
even
things
the
party
finds
odious
delaware
sen
chris
coons
told
npr
in
march
that
it's
not
about
senate
power
it's
about
giving
minority
parties
protection
and
encouraging
bipartisanship
it's
a
terrible
idea
said
coons
who
has
long
defended
the
filibuster
democrats
would
reap
the
whirlwind
almost
immediately
