trump
flanked

wilbur
ross
back
and
u.s.
attorney
general
william
barr
delivers
remarks
on
citizenship
data
in
the
rose
garden
at
the
white
house
in
washington
d.c.
in
july
after
its
failed
attempt
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
the
trump
administration
has
forged
ahead
with
ordering
the
census
bureau
to
use
government
records
to
produce
data
about
the
u.s.
citizenship
status
of
every
person
living
in
the
country
in
july
the
bureau
quietly
filed
a
regulatory
document
confirming
that
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
who
oversees
the
federal
government's
largest
statistical
agency
had
directed
it
to
produce
citizenship
voting
age
population
information
that
states
may
use
in
redistricting
last
december
the
bureau
announced
it
was
formally
collecting
feedback
from
state
redistricting
officials
on
the
type
of
demographic
information
needed
to
redraw
voting
districts
after
the
census
if
those
stakeholders
indicate
a
need
for
tabulations
of
citizenship
data
on
the
census
public
law
redistricting
data
file
the
census
bureau
will
make
a
design
change
to
include
citizenship
as
part
of
that
data
the
bureau
said
in
a
federal
register
notice
it
turns
out
that
not
a
single
stakeholder
told
the
census
bureau
there
was
a
need
to
include
citizenship
information
in
the
redistricting
data
the
bureau
announced
this
week
in
a
regulatory
document
filed
with
the
white
house's
office
of
management
and
budget
but
the
bureau
is
still
planning
to
release
citizenship
information
separate
from
the
redistricting
data
file
by
march
the
announcement
raises
questions
about
exactly
why
trump
administration
officials
have
cited
state
redistricting
as
a
reason
to
push
for
the
release
of
citizenship
data
that
are
more
detailed
than
the
estimates
from
the
bureau's
american
community
survey
before
he
died
gop
redistricting
strategist
thomas
hofeller
concluded
in
an
unpublished
study
that
detailed
citizenship
information
could
allow
for
the
redrawing
of
voting
districts
that
would
be
advantageous
to
republicans
and
non-hispanic
whites
trump
administration
attorneys
however
have
argued
that
hofeller
played
little
if
any
role
in
advocating
for
a
citizenship
question
that
would
have
produced
detailed
citizenship
data
still
president
trump
has
emphasized
the
potential
implications
of
this
data
on
state
redistricting
through
an
executive
order
released
in
july
trump
directed
all
federal
agencies
including
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
social
security
administration
to
share
their
citizenship
records
with
the
commerce
department
i
understand
that
some
state
officials
are
interested
in
such
data
for
districting
purposes
trump
said
in
the
executive
order
on
collecting
citizenship
information
this
order
will
assist
the
commerce
department
in
securing
the
most
accurate
and
complete
citizenship
data
so
that
it
can
respond
to
such
requests
from
the
states
the
white
house
has
not
responded
to
npr's
questions
about
which
state
officials
the
president
was
referring
to
in
the
executive
order
the
commerce
department's
office
of
public
affairs
has
also
not
responded
to
npr's
questions
about
ross
decision
to
order
the
data
produced
one
notable
reason
for
citizenship
data
that
is
not
mentioned
in
the
executive
order
is
enforcing
the
voting
rights
act
protections
against
the
discrimination
of
racial
and
language
minorities
throughout
the
legal
battle
over
the
now-blocked
citizenship
question
the
administration
used
that
civil
rights-era
law
as
its
stated
motivation
a
rationale
that
federal
courts
rejected
with
one
judge
calling
it
a
sham
justification
the
order
does
reference
a
u.s.
supreme
court
ruling
in
evenwel
v
abbott
that
left
unresolved
whether
it
is
legal
for
states
to
redraw
legislative
districts
based
on
the
number
of
eligible
voters
in
an
area
rather
than
all
residents
we
need
not
and
do
not
resolve
whether
as
texas
now
argues
states
may
draw
districts
to
equalize
voter-eligible
population
rather
than
total
population
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wrote
on
behalf
of
the
court
majority
that
decision
set
up
this
issue
for
a
future
supreme
court
fight
and
the
trump
administration's
efforts
around
citizenship
data
have
helped
pave
the
path
to
a
potential
political
battle
the
bureau's
chief
scientist
john
abowd
recently
announced
that
by
next
march
the
bureau
plans
to
finalize
how
it
will
release
the
citizenship
data
in
