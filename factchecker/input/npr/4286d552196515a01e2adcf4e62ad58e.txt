president
trump
and
vice
president
pence
are
taking
one
small
step
that
they
hope
will
mark
a
giant
leap
toward
the
military
branch
they
want
for
outer
space
at
a
ceremony
thursday
at
the
white
house
the
pair
plan
to
take
part
in
a
ceremony
commemorating
the
return
of
the
u.s.
space
command
after
a
year
hiatus
space
command
is
a
division
within
the
defense
department
tasked
with
unifying
and
directing
national
security
operations
in
space
it's
not
to
be
confused
with
the
trump-proposed
sixth
military
branch
that's
come
to
be
known
as
space
force
a
plan
that
faces
a
much
more
complicated
path
because
creating
a
branch
of
the
armed
forces
requires
congressional
approval
nevertheless
the
trump
administration
is
hailing
the
revival
of
space
command
as
a
milestone
in
its
quest
to
dedicate
troops
to
the
final
frontier
to
ensure
the
protection
of
america's
interests
in
space
we
must
apply
the
necessary
focus
energy
and
resources
to
the
task
and
that
is
exactly
what
space
command
will
do
defense
secretary
mark
esper
said
at
a
news
conference
wednesday
with
gen
joseph
dunford
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
as
a
unified
combatant
command
the
united
states
space
command
is
the
next
crucial
step
towards
the
creation
of
an
independent
space
force
as
an
additional
armed
service
space
command
traces
its
roots
back
to
when
it
was
established
by
the
air
force
to
coordinate
missile
defense
and
surveillance
efforts
at
a
time
when
the
cold
war
was
again
heating
up
but
times
and
presidential
priorities
change
and
after
the
attacks
of
sept
federal
authorities
turned
their
attentions
to
combating
terrorism
space
command
was
merged
into
the
unified
strategic
command
in
when
it
was
repurposed
to
focus
on
the
u.s.
led
invasion
of
afghanistan
it
wasn't
until
late
last
year
that
president
trump
formally
ordered
the
pentagon
to
strip
the
strategic
command
of
its
space
related
responsibilities
and
give
them
to
a
separate
entity
one
tasked
with
overseeing
all
u.s.
military
and
intelligence
efforts
in
space
that
includes
defending
american
satellites
supporting
american
troops
from
orbit
and
planning
how
future
combat
might
be
conducted
in
space
air
force
gen
john
raymond
has
been
tapped
and
senate-confirmed
to
lead
the
reestablished
group
raymond
was
a
natural
candidate
for
the
role
for
the
past
three
years
he
has
led
the
air
force
space
command
the
confusingly
similarly
named
office
that
focuses
solely
on
air
force
operations
in
space
that
division
has
been
around
since
splitting
it
from
the
air
force
and
making
it
an
independent
entity
has
been
floated
by
some
as
one
possible
means
of
creating
a
sixth
armed
service
a
move
of
that
magnitude
also
would
require
congressional
approval
however
when
outlining
the
trump
administration's
vision
for
the
service
last
year
pence
said
they're
in
negotiations
to
stand
up
the
united
states
space
force
before
the
end
of
for
now
though
pence
and
his
counterpart
in
the
oval
office
are
embracing
the
revived
space
command
as
a
way
to
consolidate
leadership
structures
and
coordinate
missions
this
step
will
put
us
on
a
path
to
maintain
a
competitive
advantage
dunford
said
last
week
at
a
meeting
of
the
national
space
council
which
oversees
the
nation's
space
policy
the
direction
is
clear
we
understand
it
and
we're
moving
on
