trump
says
his
panel
will
be
working
through
the
scheduled
upcoming
two-week
congressional
recess
i
can
tell
you
it's
going
to
be
a
very
busy
couple
of
weeks
ahead
schiff
told
reporters
the
chairman
said
the
committee
is
scheduling
hearings
and
witness
interviews
as
well
as
working
on
document
requests
and
possible
subpoenas
the
foreign
affairs
intelligence
and
oversight
committees
issued
a
joint
subpoena
on
friday
for
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
to
compel
documents
that
the
state
department
has
so
far
declined
to
turn
over
to
congress
the
committees
want
state
department
records
of
the
president's
communications
with
ukraine
that
are
now
the
central
focus
of
an
impeachment
investigation
your
failure
or
refusal
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
shall
constitute
evidence
of
obstruction
of
the
house's
impeachment
inquiry
the
chairmen
of
the
three
committees
warned
pompeo
in
a
letter
pompeo
is
facing
an
oct
deadline
the
committee
says
it
will
also
take
depositions
over
the
course
of
the
next
two
weeks
from
five
state
department
officials
who
have
some
knowledge
of
the
events
that
transpired
they
are

former

ukraine
marie
masha

special

sondland
volker
resigned
his
position
as
special
envoy
friday
the
depositions
will
be
conducted
jointly
by
the
three
committees
asked
how
congress
will
respond
if
the
white
house
stonewalls
congressional
requests
as
it
has
on
virtually
all
other
lines
of
inquiry
schiff
responded
they'll
just
strengthen
the
case
of
obstruction
rep
jim
himes
d-conn
a
senior
member
of
the
intelligence
committee
said
he
will
spend
part
of
the
recess
on
a
codel
a
trip
abroad
for
lawmakers
but
he
declined
to
identify
the
locale
or
whether
the
trip
is
to
include
ukraine
for
security
reasons
we
don't
like
to
talk
about
destinations
himes
said
but
he
echoed
schiff
that
the
panel
would
be
working
throughout
the
recess
and
that
panel
members
may
return
to
washington
the
speaker
has
made
it
very
clear
that
we
are
not
to
let
momentum
drop
in
this
two
weeks
he
said
himes
said
the
committee
would
like
to
hear
from
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
who
is
involved
in
the
issues
raised
by
the
july
call
that
sparked
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
has
led
to
the
impeachment
inquiry
giuliani
has
met
with
ukrainian
officials
in
regard
to
the
president's
request
to
investigate
the
biden
family
but
he
has
forcefully
denied
any
wrongdoing
in
a
number
of
dramatic
media
interviews
in
recent
days
in
a
spiral
of
accusations
giuliani
alleges
a
conspiracy
involving
the
obama
administration
the
clinton
foundation
the
biden
family
the
ukrainian
government
and
ukrainian
business
interests
giuliani
told
fox
news
on
thursday
that
he
had
to
investigate
it
because
the
justice
department
would
not
i
got
this
because
the
fbi
wouldn't
take
it
he
told
fox
i
think
we
need
to
understand
who
giuliani
talked
to
and
what
he
said
himes
said
my
hope
would
be
that
we
could
do
that
without
creating
the
kind
of
public
spectacle
that
seems
to
be
his
reason
for
being
himes
said
the
committee
wants
to
know
why
a
private
citizen
was
conducting
foreign
policy
and
talking
to
foreign
leaders
on
behalf
of
the
president
i
do
think
we're
going
to
need
to
understand
what
he
said
and
to
whom
he
said
it
he
said
schiff
has
been
assuring
rank-and-file
lawmakers
that
he
will
keep
them
up
to
speed
on
the
committee's
progress
this
is
very
fast-moving
every
single
day
information
is
coming
out
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
explain
to
our
constituents
what's
going
on
said
rep
pramila
jayapal
d-wash
who
said
schiff
met
with
a
faction
of
progressive
lawmakers
and
told
them
he
will
make
sure
the
caucus
is
updated
regularly
generally
party
leaders
will
convene
conference
calls
during
recess
weeks
if
a
need
arises
i
have
a
feeling
those
conference
calls
will
be
packed
jayapal
said
of
the
next
two
weeks
democrats
so
far
have
largely
shrugged
off
whether
the
impeachment
inquiry
will
derail
the
party's
ability
to
talk
about
anything
else
i'm
not
concerned
about
us
slowing
down
our
business
in
the
house
said
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
noting
the
house
has
sent
many
bills
over
to
the
senate
if
the
senate
was
actually
being
productive
and
being
worth
their
weight
then
i'd
be
concerned
but
they
haven't
done
a
damn
thing
all
year
she
said
there's
no
leverage
there
in
terms
of
their
productivity
they
haven't
been
doing
anything
rep
gerry
connolly
d-va
who
sits
on
the
foreign
affairs
and
oversight
committees
says
this
recess
will
allow
lawmakers
to
let
constituents
know
the
gravity
of
the
impeachment
probe
don't
we
want
to
go
home
and
talk
with
our
constituents
about
this
momentous
decision
that
has
been
made
he
said
we
have
a
legislative
agenda
we've
been
pushing
i
think
going
home
and
talking
about
those
other
things
too
is
the
surest
way
to
reassure
people
that
we
are
capable
of
doing
more
than
one
thing
at
one
time
