president
trump
said
wednesday
that
the
push
for
his
impeachment
is
a
hoax
again
denying
any
wrongdoing
during
a
july
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
during
which
he
pushed
for
an
investigation
into
former
vice
president
joe
biden
a
potential
rival
no
push
no
pressure
no
nothing
it's
all
a
hoax
folks
it's
all
a
big
hoax
trump
said
trump's
remarks
capped
a
whirlwind
day
of
revelations
allegations
and
counterclaims
that
have
rocked
washington
and
are
likely
to
play
a
pivotal
role
in
the
runup
to
the
presidential
election
an
account
of
his
scrutinized
july
call
with
the
ukrainian
president
was
released
wednesday
morning
and
trump's
republican
allies
contend
that
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
made
a
fatal
error
by
pursuing
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
the
president
over
the
allegations
the
democrats
meanwhile
say
they
believe
the
account
of
the
call
provides
sufficient
evidence
of
trump's
alleged
wrongdoing
at
a
news
conference
in
new
york
trump
also
said
that
he
has
spoken
with
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
and
republicans
and
that
he
fully
supports
transparency
on
the
whistleblower
information
he
took
few
questions
about
the
ukraine
call
instead
opining
mostly
about
the
economy
trade
meetings
with
world
leaders
and
other
matters
congressional
members
review
whistleblower
account
on
wednesday
afternoon
congressional
leaders
and
members
of
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
committees
were
allowed
to
view
the
still-classified
whistleblower
account
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
said
he
found
the
allegations
set
forth
deeply
disturbing
very
credible
well-written
and
a
road
map
for
follow-up
from
other
witnesses
rep
eric
swalwell
d-calif
said
the
report
was
serious
urgent
and
credible
and
we
should
hear
from
the
whistleblower
via
testimony
he
also
told
npr's
all
things
considered
that
he
did
not
see
the
full
report
and
that
the
committee
will
ask
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
for
more
materials
in
a
meeting
thursday
it's
really
unfortunate
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
whistleblower
law
for
the
intelligence
community
that
we
are
being
blocked
from
hearing
from
the
whistleblower
or
having
the
full
report
swalwell
said
rep
raja
krishnamoorthi
d-ill
said
he
plans
to
push
maguire
for
answers
on
what
the
motivations
were
behind
not
turning
the
whistleblower
report
over
to
congress
it's
very
well
done
it's
thorough
krishnamoorthi
said
it
raises
a
lot
of
questions
about
what
else
is
out
there
republicans
were
largely
silent
on
wednesday
evening
but
sen
ben
sasse
r-neb
told
cnn's
jeff
zeleny
that
there
were
real
troubling
things
in
the
complaint
republicans
ought
not
just
circle
the
wagons
and
democrats
ought
not
be
using
words
like
impeach
before
they
knew
anything
about
the
actual
substance
sasse
who
once
frequently
criticized
trump
but
has
since
garnered
his
endorsement
said
rough
transcript
contradicts
trump
denials
trump
has
been
defending
the
call
saying
the
record
proves
he
did
not
pressure
the
ukrainian
leader
but
that
isn't
quelling
the
movement
toward
impeachment
in
congress
in
fact
top
house
democrats
say
it
confirms
the
need
for
an
inquiry
the
president
said
he
decided
to
release
the
call
recap
saying
i
was
just
getting
such
fake
news
i
just
thought
it
would
be
better
trump
also
said
he
would
be
willing
to
release
a
prior
call
with
zelenskiy
along
with
conversations
that
vice
president
pence
had
with
the
foreign
leader
earlier
on
wednesday
trump
appeared
alongside
zelenskiy
from
new
york
where
both
denied
that
trump
tried
to
pressure
ukraine
into
investigating
biden's
son
hunter
trump
emphasized
that
there
was
no
pressure
and
repeated
stories
that
he
and
his
private
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
have
told
that
insinuate
the
younger
biden
took
part
in
corrupt
activities
in
china
and
ukraine
as
explained
here
trump
and
giuliani
have
not
provided
any
evidence
of
wrongdoing
when
asked
whether
he
had
been
pushed
to
investigate
hunter
biden
zelenskiy
said
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
want
to
be
involved
in
democratic
open
elections
in
usa
he
described
the
phone
call
as
good
and
normal
we
spoke
about
many
things
zelenskiy
said
adding
later
nobody
pushed
me
but
the
rough
transcript
contradicts
those
denials
trump
notes
at
the
outset
that
we
do
a
lot
for
ukraine
he
asks
zelenskiy
about
a
favor
later
going
on
to
tell
him
i
would
like
you
to
find
out
what
happened
with
this
whole
situation
in
ukraine
and
the
bidens
democrats
move
forward
on
impeachment
inquiry
earlier
wednesday
pelosi
said
in
a
statement
that
the
transcript
and
the
justice
department's
acting
in
a
rogue
fashion
in
being
complicit
in
the
president's
lawlessness
confirm
the
need
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
pelosi
added
i
respect
the
responsibility
of
the
president
to
engage
with
foreign
leaders
as
part
of
his
job
it
is
not
part
of
his
job
to
use
taxpayer
money
to
shake
down
other
countries
for
the
benefit
of
his
campaign
schiff
called
the
president's
conversation
with
his
ukrainian
counterpart
a
classic
mafialike
shakedown
of
a
foreign
leader
the
notes
of
the
call
reflect
a
conversation
far
more
damning
than
i
or
many
others
had
imagined
he
said
wednesday
on
capitol
hill
trump
pushed
back
during
his
news
conference
calling
it
a
perfect
and
beautiful
call
he
argued
that
pelosi
was
allowing
more
liberal
members
of
her
caucus
to
push
her
toward
impeachment
proceedings
when
nancy
pelosi
allows
her
position
to
be
taken
over
by
radical
far-left
socialists
or
worse
that's
pretty
bad
the
president
said
trump
also
said
he
had
thought
that
impeachment
talk
was
dead
after
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
released
his
report
into
russian
interference
in
the
election
what
these
democrats
have
done
to
ruin
lives
is
so
sad
trump
said
schiff
said
he
didn't
want
to
get
ahead
of
ourselves
when
asked
whether
the
house
would
definitely
vote
on
articles
of
impeachment
it
will
be
a
decision
for
us
once
we
conclude
our
investigative
work
whether
to
bring
this
or
other
matters
in
the
form
of
articles
to
a
vote
he
said
and
we'll
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it
but
no
one
should
have
any
illusions
he
continued
about
the
seriousness
of
what
is
already
uncontested
and
that
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
betrayed
his
oath
of
office
and
sacrificed
our
national
security
in
doing
so
in
a
joint
statement
schiff
and
other
house
committee
chairmen
including
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
elijah
cummings
d-md
and
eliot
engel
d-n
y.
said
no
quid
pro
quo
is
required
to
betray
our
country
trump
asked
a
foreign
government
to
interfere
in
our
elections
that
is
betrayal
enough
the
corruption
exists
whether
or
not
trump
threatened
explicitly
or
implicitly
that
a
lack
of
cooperation
could
result
in
withholding
military
aid
utah
sen
mitt
romney
a
frequent
gop
critic
of
the
president
called
the
memo
deeply
troubling
speaking
at
a
conference
in
washington
romney
said
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
asks
or
presses
the
leader
of
a
foreign
country
to
carry
out
an
investigation
of
a
political
nature
that's
troubling
republicans
defend
trump
other
republicans
however
rallied
to
the
president's
defense
rep
matt
gaetz
r-fla
a
fervent
support
of
trump's
said
the
memo
of
the
call
showed
that
pelosi
has
been
functionally
catfished
into
a
politically
fatal
impeachment
proceeding
based
on
rumors
based
on
faulty
evidence
and
based
on
a
bloodlust
for
the
president
politically
that
does
not
serve
our
nation
well
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
called
the
rough
transcript
of
the
call
underwhelming
graham
said
impeachment
over
this
what
a
nothing
non-quid
pro
quo
burger
democrats
have
lost
their
minds
when
it
comes
to
president
trump
a
dozen
gop
members
of
the
house
and
senate
were
given
an
advance
view
of
the
memo
at
a
white
house
meeting
attended
by
white
house
counsel
pat
cipollone
one
of
those
present
sen
ron
johnson
r-wis
said
we
certainly
saw
no
quid
pro
quo
and
also
employing
the
culinary
metaphor
it's
turning
into
a
real
nothingburger
the
document
released
by
the
white
house
is
labeled
a
memorandum
that
is
not
a
verbatim
transcript
of
a
discussion
the
text
in
this
document
records
the
notes
and
recollections
of
situation
room
duty
officers
and
national
security
council
policy
staff
assigned
to
listen
and
memorialize
the
conversation
in
written
form
as
the
conversation
takes
place
pelosi
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
on
tuesday
without
having
access
to
the
transcript
but
she
said
earlier
in
the
day
that
evidence
of
a
quid
pro
quo
was
not
a
requirement
pelosi
called
trump's
actions
a
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
betrayal
of
our
national
security
and
betrayal
of
the
integrity
of
our
elections
the
president
must
be
held
accountable
pelosi
said
no
one
is
above
the
law
she
had
previously
resisted
pressure
from
more
liberal
members
of
her
caucus
who
have
been
pushing
for
impeachment
impeachment
the
formal
charging
of
wrongdoing
against
a
president
could
likely
pass
in
a
democratic-controlled
house
just
two
presidents
have
been
impeached
in
history
andrew
johnson
and
bill
clinton
president
richard
nixon
was
staring
down
an
impeachment
vote
amid
the
watergate
scandal
but
resigned
before
formal
impeachment
articles
were
brought
forward
however
no
president
has
ever
been
convicted
in
the
senate
and
subsequently
removed
from
office
and
such
a
feat
would
be
tough
in
the
gop-controlled
senate
where
votes
would
be
required
