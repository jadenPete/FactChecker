the
national
rifle
association
is
suing
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
and
its
board
of
supervisors
over
a
unanimous
vote
to
designate
the
nra
a
domestic
terrorist
organization
the
pro-gun
group
says
lawmakers
are
trying
to
discriminate
against
people
based
on
the
viewpoint
of
their
political
speech
in
its
sept
resolution
the
board
said
san
francisco
should
take
every
reasonable
step
to
limit
any
vendors
and
contractors
with
which
it
does
business
from
also
doing
business
with
the
nra
it
also
said
it
is
urging
other
cities
states
and
the
federal
government
to
do
the
same
the
nra
calls
the
terrorist
designation
a
frivolous
insult
but
it
adds
that
the
lawmakers
actions
also
pose
a
nonfrivolous
constitutional
threat
the
group
says
san
francisco
is
violating
u.s.
laws
that
protect
free
speech
and
association
the
terrorist-designation
resolution
is
not
yet
official
as
mayor
london
breed
has
not
signed
it
if
she
doesn't
endorse
the
bill
within
days
of
passage
it
will
take
effect
without
any
other
action
but
she
could
also
veto
the
resolution
responding
to
questions
from
npr
about
breed's
position
on
the
matter
the
mayor's
office
said
on
tuesday
as
a
matter
of
practice
the
mayor
does
not
sign
policy
resolutions
that
are
passed
by
the
board
of
the
supervisors
it
then
referred
any
further
questions
about
the
lawsuit
to
city
attorney
john
cote
the
nra
suit
also
warns
against
reasonably
expected
chilling
effects
accusing
the
san
francisco
board
of
using
mccarthyist
elements
in
an
attempt
to
silence
it
and
carry
out
a
political
vendetta
the
nra
says
the
resolution
would
chill
a
person
of
ordinary
firmness
from
continuing
to
speak
against
gun
control
or
from
associating
with
the
nra
the
resolution
accuses
the
nra
of
using
its
money
and
influence
to
promote
gun
ownership
and
incite
gun
owners
to
acts
of
violence
adding
that
the
group
spreads
propaganda
that
misinforms
and
aims
to
deceive
the
public
about
the
dangers
of
gun
violence
san
francisco's
resolution
which
lacks
explicit
enforcement
tools
describes
the
u.s.
as
being
plagued
by
an
epidemic
of
gun
violence
including
over
deaths
and
injuries
each
year
it
also
notes
the
mass
shooting
in
july
at
the
gilroy
garlic
festival
south
of
san
francisco
in
which
a
gunman
killed
three
people
including
two
children
the
measure's
sponsor
supervisor
catherine
stefani
is
a
former
prosecutor
and
a
current
gun
violence
prevention
activist
she
is
a
leader
in
the
group
moms
demand
action
for
gun
sense
in
america
when
her
resolution
was
approved
last
week
stefani
was
quoted
by
member
station
kqed
as
saying
the
nra
uses
intimidation
and
threats
to
promote
its
agenda
when
they
use
phrases
like
i'll
give
you
my
gun
when
you
pry
it
from
my
cold
dead
hands
on
bumper
stickers
they
are
saying
reasoned
debate
about
public
safety
should
be
met
with
violence
stefani
said
san
francisco's
move
against
the
nra
follows
recent
efforts
in
los
angeles
and
new
york
state
where
officials
have
sought
to
pressure
businesses
to
cut
ties
with
the
group
in
its
lawsuit
the
nra
notes
courts
have
sustained
first
amendment
claims
in
both
los
angeles
and
new
york
as
his
group
responds
to
the
san
francisco
resolution
nra
ceo
wayne
lapierre
says
this
lawsuit
comes
with
a
message
to
those
who
attack
the
nra
we
will
never
stop
fighting
for
our
law-abiding
members
and
their
constitutional
freedoms
in
their
resolution
the
san
francisco
lawmakers
state
all
countries
have
violent
and
hateful
people
but
only
in
america
do
we
give
them
ready
access
to
assault
weapons
and
large-capacity
magazines
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
national
rifle
association's
influence
