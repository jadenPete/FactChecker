community
groups
based

are
suing
to
block
the
trump
administration
from
collecting
government
records
for
the
production
of
data
concerning
the
u.s.
citizenship
status
of
every
person
living
in

the
lawsuit
marks
the
first
legal
challenge
in
response
to
trump's
july
executive
order
about
citizenship
data
extending
a
legal
fight
that
began
with
the
administration's
push
for
the
now-blocked
citizenship
question
a
major
gop
strategist
had
concluded
that
information
which
the
census
bureau
has
been
directed
to
produce
by
using
citizenship
records
from
other
federal
agencies
and
state
governments
could
be
used
by
state
redistricting
officials
after
the
census
to
redraw
voting
districts
that
are
advantageous
to
republicans
and
non-hispanic
whites
in
a

friday
by
npr
attorneys
with
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and

fund
and
asian
americans
advancing
justice
aajc
outline
allegations
that
are
similar
to
their
earlier
lawsuit
against
the
addition
of
the
citizenship
question
they
argue
that
the
trump
administration's
efforts
are
part
of
a
conspiracy
intended
to
prevent
latinx
communities
noncitizens
and
other
immigrants
from
receiving
fair
representation
when
state
and
local
voting
lines
are
redrawn
after
the
census
the
challengers
also
allege
that
the
administration
is
violating
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
trying
to
carry
out
trump's
executive
order
thomas
saenz
maldef's
president
and
general
counsel
describes
the
efforts
as
a
way
of
saving
face
for
the
president
after
the
supreme
court
ruled
to
keep
the
citizenship
question
off
the
census
forms
we
know
that
effectively
no
process
was
followed
saenz
tells
npr
it
was
an
announcement
made
in
reaction
to
the
president
having
to
abandon
his
effort
to
include
a
citizenship
question
the
justice
department
declined
to
comment
on
the
lawsuit
according
to
doj
spokesperson
kelly
laco
npr
has
also
reached
out
to
the
census
bureau
and
commerce
department
which
oversees
the
bureau
for
comment
the
complaint
was
filed
with
the
u.s.
district
court
in
greenbelt
md
where
earlier
this
year
maldef
and
other
groups
successfully
challenged
the
trump
administration's
attempt
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
compiling
the
records
of
federal
agencies
to
create
citizenship
data
was
originally
proposed
by
census
bureau
researchers
as
an
alternative
to
the
administration's
request
in
late
for
a
census
citizenship
question
including
the
question
the
bureau's
chief
scientist
warned
could
jeopardize
the
accuracy
of
census
information
which
is
used
to
determine
the
distribution
of
congressional
seats
electoral
college
votes
and
federal
funding
among
the
states
but
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
overruled
the
recommendations
of
the
researchers
and
pushed
to
add
the
citizenship
question
to
forms
for
the
upcoming
national
head
count
in
his
memo
announcing
the
question's
addition
in
march
ross
directed
the
bureau
to
begin
gathering
citizenship
records
from
other
federal
agencies
in
order
to
match
them
with
responses
to
the
question
to
provide
more
comprehensive
information
for
the
population
ultimately
however
three
federal
judges
including
one
in
maryland
blocked
the
question
in
part
because
they
found
that
ross
violated
a
legal
requirement
to
rely
on
existing
government
records
for
demographic
information
before
resorting
to
adding
a
census
question
the
executive
order
makes
no
mention
of
the
voting
rights
act
the
administration's
original
stated
reason
for
why
it
wants
citizenship
data
that
are
more
detailed
than
the
estimates
the
government
has
used
to
enforce
the
civil
rights-era
law
since
it
was
first
enacted
in
instead
the
order
said
the
information
could
be
used
for
understanding
the
effects
of
immigration
on
the
u.s.
evaluating
the
potential
effects
of
proposals
to
alter
the
eligibility
rules
for
public
benefits
producing
a
more
reliable
count
of
unauthorized
immigrants
and
for
allowing
states
to
redraw
voting
districts
based
on
the
number
of
eligible
voters
in
an
area
rather
than
all
residents
i
understand
that
some
state
officials
are
interested
in
such
data
for
districting
purposes
trump
said
in
the
order
this
order
will
assist
the
department
in
securing
the
most
accurate
and
complete
citizenship
data
so
that
it
can
respond
to
such
requests
from
the
states
this
week
the
census
bureau
announced
that
not
a
single
state
redistricting
official
asked
for
citizenship
information
to
be
included
in
the
redistricting
data
the
bureau
plans
to
release
after
the
census
the
agency
however
said
that
it
is
still
working
to
put
out
citizenship
data
for
state
redistricting
in
