et
president
trump
said
monday
that
his
door
might
be
open
for
meetings
with
iran's
president
and
china's
leader
as
he
concluded
his
visit
to
the
g-
summit
in
france
but
it
isn't
clear
what
if
any
action
may
come
next
trump
said
he
believes
beijing
wants
a
deal
very
badly
to
end
its
trade
war
with
washington
and
that
he'd
consider
meeting
with
iran's
president
if
tehran
came
to
terms
over
its
nuclear
program
if
the
circumstances
were
correct
or
right
i
would
certainly
agree
to
that
trump
said
what
isn't
clear
is
what
precisely
that
might
require
and
whether
trump
or
the
american
side
are
willing
to
exert
themselves
to
make
either
conference
happen
french
president
emmanuel
macron
with
whom
trump
appeared
on
monday
after
the
global
leaders
summit
has
been
trying
to
broker
new
talks
between
iran
and
the
united
states
including
an
invitation
to
iran's
foreign
minister
to
visit
france
as
the
g-
nations
were
meeting
macron
said
trump
and
the
americans
were
kept
in
the
loop
about
those
overtures
trump
said
he
would
be
open
to
some
concessions
including
giving
iran
a
line
of
credit
to
help
its
economy
which
he
said
would
be
secured
by
the
nation's
oil
supplies
if
it
were
willing
to
make
new
concessions
on
its
nuclear
program
regarding
china
trump
said
he
is
willing
to
reach
an
agreement
on
trade
only
if
it's
a
good
deal
and
a
fair
deal
but
he
said
he
believes
the
chinese
are
eager
and
i
think
we're
going
to
get
there

on
sunday
summit
host
and
french
president
emmanuel
macron
and
president
trump
held
a
joint
news
conference
on
monday
trump
defended
the
erratic
course
corrections
that
have
characterized
his
handling
of
the
china
trade
and
other
matters
for
example
trump
announced
additional
tariffs
on
china
last
friday
and
said
he
was
ordering
american
businesses
to
assess
withdrawing
from
china
that
prompted
a
huge
sell-off
on
wall
street
then
he
made
more
conciliatory
remarks
monday
at
the
g-
sorry
trump
said
that's
the
way
i
negotiate
back
and
forth
the
remarks
on
monday
followed
a
day
of
seemingly
contradictory
comments
about
the
ongoing
trade
war
with
china
and
the
unexpected
appearance
by
iran's
foreign
minister
on
sunday
trump
was
asked
if
he
was
having
second
thoughts
about
the
tariffs
he
responded
yeah
sure
why
not
might
as
well
might
as
well
i
have
second
thoughts
about
everything
hours
later
white
house
officials
said
trump
was
being
misinterpreted
and
that
what
he
meant
was
that
he
had
second
thoughts
about
not
imposing
even
more
punitive
tariffs
on
goods
in
other
words
he
was
having
second
thoughts
about
not
having
been
even
harsher
by
monday
trump
cited
statements
that
he
said
were
coming
from
chinese
leaders
that
he
said
suggested
they
were
eager
to
negotiate
and
that
he
was
prepared
to
move
ahead
to
settle
the
dispute
over
imports
exports
and
tariffs
we'll
see
what
happens
but
i
think
we're
going
to
make
a
deal
trump
told
reporters
trump
and
macron's
news
conference
followed
the
unexpected
arrival
on
sunday
of
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif

met
with
france's
delegation

attempting
to
ease
tensions
following
the
u.s.
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
in
asked
about
zarif's
appearance
on
sunday
trump
gave
a
rare
no
comment
but
on
monday
trump
again
faulted
reporters
saying
they
mischaracterized
what
had
happened
he
insisted
that
he
was
not
surprised
and
that
he
did
not
feel
that
macron
had
been
disrespectful
by
inviting
zarif
in
fact
he
had
been
consulted
trump
said
he
spoke
to
me
he
asked
me
trump
said
of
macron
i
said
if
you
want
to
do
that
that's
ok
also
over
the
weekend
trump
announced
a
preliminary
trade
deal
with
japan
will
be
great
for
our
farmers
ranchers
and
more
really
big
corn
purchase
trump
tweeted
u.s.
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
said
the
agreement
outline
includes
agriculture
industrial
tariffs
and
digital
trade
the
stated
focus
of
the
summit
was
inequality
but
macron
said
ahead
of
time
there
would
be
no
official
communique
after
the
talks
after
the
summit
trump
withdrew
u.s.
endorsement
of
that
year's
joint
communique
