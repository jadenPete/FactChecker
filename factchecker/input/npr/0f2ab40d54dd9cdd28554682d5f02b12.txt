a

in

away
from
unsecure

judge
amy
totenberg
thursday
also
requires
the
state
to
cease
using
its
direct-recording
electronic

machines
after
and
expresses
doubts
about
the

ability
to
roll

totenberg
also
directs
the
georgia
secretary
of

to
develop
a
plan
to
address
errors
and
discrepancies
in
the
voter
registration
database
and
have
paper
copies
of

at

the
state
must
also
create
a
contingency
plan
for
the
elections
in
case
the
new
system
is
not
completely
rolled
out
that
includes
designating
several
pilot

that
will
use
hand-marked

with

in
their

this
fall
a
group
of
election
integrity
advocates
and
georgia
voters
sued
the
secretary
of
state's
office
in
alleging
that
the
current
dre
system
is
not
secure
and
is
vulnerable
to
hacking
last
year
totenberg
denied
a
similar
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
that
would
have
blocked
the
dres
from
being
used
in
the
midterm
election
the
current
motion
sought
to
prevent
the
machines
from
being
used
this
fall
in
several
hundred
local
elections
after
a
two-day
hearing
in
july
totenberg
said
deciding
on
the
matter
was
very
daunting
as
she
heard
cybersecurity
experts
express
serious
concerns
about
the
security
of
georgia's
elections
and
the
logistical
concerns
local
elections
officials
had
about
switching
to
hand-marked
paper
ballots
under
a
tight
timeline
ultimately
totenberg
wrote
that
she
deferred
to
the
state's
legislative
and
procurement
processes
to
select
and
implement
a
new
system
in
time
for
next
year's
elections
the
court
remains
concerned
based
upon
the
entirety
of
the
record
evidence
about
the
state's
capacity
to
manage
a
transition
to
paper
ballots
for
the
elections
while
overseeing
and
undergoing
a
simultaneous
transition
to

newly
enacted
