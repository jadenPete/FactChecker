the
trump
administration
struck
a
tentative
deal
to
lift
tariffs
on
imported
tomatoes
from
mexico
but
importers
warn
the
agreement
could
still
put
protectionist
roadblocks
in
the
path
of
billion
worth
of
the
produce
mexico
supplies
more
than
half
the
fresh
tomatoes
sold
in
the
u.s.
and
imports
have
more
than
doubled
since
florida
growers
who
used
to
dominate
the
market
for
tomatoes
in
the
winter
and
spring
have
long
complained
that
mexico
unfairly
subsidizes
its
tomato
crop
in
may
the
trump
administration
slapped
a
tariff
on
imported
tomatoes
and
resumed
an
investigation
into
whether
mexico
is
dumping
the
fruit
at
artificially
low
prices
the
new
agreement
if
finalized
next
month
will
suspend
that
investigation
and
lift
the
tariffs
this
draft
agreement
meets
the
needs
of
both
sides
and
avoids
the
need
for
antidumping
duties
secretary
of
commerce
wilbur
ross
said
in
a
statement
florida
growers
welcomed
the
deal
the
agreement
establishes
unprecedented
measures
and
enforcement
provisions
that
will
help
protect
american
tomato
farmers
from
injurious

a

the

represents
more
than
companies
in
the
produce-importing
hub
of
nogales
ariz
warned
the
agreement
could
require
border
inspection
of
more
than
of
imported
tomatoes
at
that
level
the
inspections
are
not
only
unnecessary
they
also
have
the
potential
to
destabilize
the
u.s.
tomato
market
said
lance
jungmeyer
president
of
the
importers
group
the
commerce
department
disputes
that
saying
only
about
of
imported
tomatoes
would
be
subject
to
inspection
at
the
border
the
agreement
specifically
excludes
one
popular
category
of
imports
tomatoes
on
the
vine
the
agreement
also
sets
new
minimum
prices
for
imports
florida
lawmakers
led
by
sen
marco
rubio
and
rep
ted
yoho
pressed
the
administration
to
adopt
a
hard
line
on
mexican
tomatoes
yoho
told
the
president
he
would
not
vote
to
ratify
a
new
trade
agreement
with
mexico
unless
the
seasonal
produce
conflict
was
addressed
first
