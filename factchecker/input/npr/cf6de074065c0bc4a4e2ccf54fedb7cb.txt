president
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
has
coffee
with
ukrainian-american
businessman
lev
parnas
at
the
trump
international
hotel
in
washington
on
sept
long
before
president
trump's
now-famous
call
with
ukraine's
president
in
july
rudy
giuliani
was
regularly
meeting
with
ukrainian
officials
in
pursuit
of
dirt
against
democratic
opponents
he
was
not
alone
there
was
a
guy
with
him
in
the
news
business
we
call
them
fixers
guides
who
know
local
people
and
can
make
introductions
set
up
meetings
and
translate
interviews
lev
parnas
a
businessman
who
says
he
splits
his
time
between
florida
and
new
york
was
one
of
giuliani's
fixers
parnas
says
he
is
a
u.s.
citizen
but
was
born
in
odessa
ukraine
back
when
it
was
part
of
the
soviet
union
parnas
helped
giuliani
search
for
evidence
to
promote
a
theory
of
corruption
in
ukraine
by
joe
biden
who
could
become
trump's
democratic
rival
in
the
election
biden's
son
hunter
who
was
on
the
board
of
a
gas
company
in
ukraine
also
was
a
focus
that
corruption
theory
isn't
holding
up
under
scrutiny
as
npr's
lucian
kim
has
reported
parnas
argues
not
all
the
facts
about
this
and
other
conspiracies
are
known
yet
and
he
is
not
ready
to
release
all
the
information
now
while
he's
keeping
that
information
secret
parnas
has
confirmed
a
few
things
outlined
in
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
was
made
public
this
week
there
was
a
skype
call
in
late
with
former
ukrainian
prosecutor
general
viktor
shokin
who
is
key
to
the
corruption
theory
i
arranged
the
shokin
call
with
the
mayor
parnas
tells
npr
referring
to
giuliani
by
his
title
from
when
he
was
mayor
of
new
york
city
there
also
were
meetings
in
late
january
in
new
york
and
mid-february
in
warsaw
with
yuriy
lutsenko
i
was
present
but
i'm
not
going
to
comment
on
what
was
discussed
in
those
meetings
says
parnas
lutsenko
was
ukraine's
prosecutor
general
until
august
and
once
suggested
hunter
biden
broke
the
law
he
later
walked
back
that
allegation
the
start
of
a
friendship
parnas
is
a
little
more
forthcoming
about
how
his
relationship
with
giuliani
started
about
two
years
ago
he
says
they
attended
the
same
political
functions
and
really
got
to
know
each
other
when
a
mutual
friend
set
up
a
meeting
to
discuss
parnas
investment
fraud
insurance
business
that
meeting
didn't
result
in
doing
business
together
but
parnas
says
it
sparked
their
relationship
we're
good
friends
we
spend
time
together
parnas
says
we
play
golf
together
about
a
year
ago
parnas
says
he
began
receiving
information
from
people
in
ukraine
about
meddling
in
the
u.s.
election
and
about
hunter
biden's
work
with
the
natural
gas
company
burisma
at
first
we
also
thought
it
couldn't
be
true
that
it
was
a
conspiracy
theory
but
parnas
says
the
information
kept
coming
he
says
some
of
it
was
in
the
form
of
solid
evidence
like
financial
records
and
stuff
like
that
where
you
can't
dispute
parnas
is
a
big
fan
of
trump
calling
him
one
of
the
greatest
presidents
we
have
but
lest
you
think
parnas
did
all
this
to
help
trump
in
the
election
he
says
absolutely
not
i
was
doing
it
because
i
felt
as
a
u.s.
citizen
it
was
my
patriotic
duty
says
parnas
playing
with
the
big
boys
parnas
actions
don't
always
seem
to
be
as
noble
as
his
stated
intentions
however
consider
one
of
his
business
enterprises
called
global
energy
producers
the
company
was
formed
to
sell
liquefied
natural
gas
from
the
u.s.
to
countries
around
the
world
especially
ukraine
doing
that
requires
permits
and
licenses
that
can
take
years
to
acquire
parnas
sought
to
jump-start
that
process
by
making
big
political
contributions
including
a
donation
to
a
pro-trump
political
action
committee
called
america
first
action
i
wanted
to
get
notoriety
for
my
energy
company
and
i
felt
it
might
be
a
great
way
to
play
with
the
big
boys
says
parnas
parnas
made
the
contribution
with
a
business
partner
igor
fruman
he
reportedly
has
also
helped
giuliani
npr
wasn't
able
to
reach
him
for
this
story
the
contribution
was
wired
from
an
account
that
did
not
belong
to
global
energy
producers
which
caught
the
attention
of
the
campaign
legal
center
the
organization
labeled
the
company
shady
and
filed
a
complaint
with
the
federal
election
commission
fruman
and
parnas
appear
to
have
bought
access
to
trumpworld
by
directing
a
six-figure
contribution
to
a
pro-trump
superpac
through
a
shell
corporation
says
brendan
fischer
an
attorney
with
the
clc
fischer
says
the
fec
is
still
considering
the
complaint
parnas
says
no
one
in
the
administration
has
promised
to
help
his
business
because
of
the
contribution
he
says
the
way
the
money
was
wired
to
the
pac
was
a
mistake
and
he
has
learned
to
do
it
differently
next
time
it's
a
whole
big
misunderstanding
that
my
attorneys
are
going
to
clear
up
says
parnas
and
he
says
the
plan
to
get
attention
didn't
work
anyway
with
all
this
publicity
it's
been
difficult
to
do
any
business
obviously
in
ukraine
now
says
parnas
contributing
to
the
publicity
are
this
week's
developments
including
the
impeachment
inquiry
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
announced
on
tuesday
parnas
says
he
is
spending
a
lot
of
time
fielding
calls
from
reporters
i'm
a
little
upset
with
the
way
the
news
is
coming
out
because
i
don't
think
our
president
did
anything
wrong
says
parnas
he
is
optimistic
the
outcome
will
favor
his
side
of
the
country's
political
divide
we
have
god
and
the
truth
on
our
side
so
i
think
that
will
prevail
says
parnas
