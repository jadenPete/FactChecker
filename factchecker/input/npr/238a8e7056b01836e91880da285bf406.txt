a
group
of
guys
are
staring
into
a
laptop
exchanging
excited
giggles
every
couple
minutes
there's
an
oooooh
that
morphs
into
an
expectant
hush
the
las
vegas
scene
seems
more
like
a
college
dorm
party
than
a
deep
dive
into
the
democratic
process
cans
of
pabst
blue
ribbon
are
being
tossed
around
one
is
cracked
open
and
spews
foam
all
over
a
computer
keyboard
that's
a
new
vulnerability
someone
yells
the
laptop
that's
drawing
the
most
attention
in
this
moment
is
plugged
into
a
voting
machine
that
was
used
just
last
year
in
virginia
right
now
we're
trying
to
develop
a
way
to
remotely
control
the
voting
machine
said
a
hacker
named
alex
he's
seated
next
to
ryan
and
like
a
lot
of
the
hackers
at
the
defcon
conference
they
didn't
feel
comfortable
giving
their
full
names
what
they're
doing
messing
around
with
voting
equipment
the
innards
of
democracy
falls
into
a
legal
gray
area
the
voting
machine
looks
sort
of
like
a
game
of
operation
the
cover
is
off
and
dozens
of
cords
are
sticking
out
leading
to
multiple
keyboards
and
laptop
computers
no
one
could
get
that
kind
of
access
on
a
real
election
day
which
is
when
most
people
come
into
contact
with
voting
machines
for
a
few
minutes
at
most
election
supervisors
are
quick
to
point
out
that
any
vulnerabilities
found
under
these
conditions
aren't
indicative
of
problems
that
actually
could
be
exploited
during
an
election
all
the
same
hackers
like
alex
and
ryan
say
the
work
they're
doing
is
important
because
it's
the
highest
profile
public
investigation
of
the
equipment
u.s.
citizens
use
to
vote
and
if
they
can
exploit
it
so
could
government-sponsored
specialists
working
for
another
nation's
intelligence
agency
governments
contract
with
private
companies
to
provide
voting
equipment
and
other
services
and
there
are
no
laws
requiring
any
sort
of
breach
disclosure
or
third
party
security
auditing
even
the
governments
themselves
are
usually
barred
from
hiring
a
security
firm
to
investigate
the
machines
they
serve
to
voters
at
this
year's
defcon
it
was
alex's
first
time
looking
at
the
technology
that
voters
use
to
cast
their
ballots
and
he
wasn't
impressed
the
machine
he's
investigating
is
a
ballot-marking
device
used
to
help
people
with
physical
impairments
or
language
barriers
vote
and
it's
running
a
version
of
windows
that
is
more
than
years
old
these
systems
crash
at
your
wal-mart
scanning
your
groceries
and
we're
using
those
systems
here
to
protect
our
democracy
which
is
a
little
bit
unsettling
he
said
i
wouldn't
even
use
this
to
control
a
camera
at
my
house
or
my
toaster
the
paradox
russian
cyberattacks
targeted
a
number
of
voter
databases
election
vendors
and
other
such
systems
in
the
presidential
election
there's
no
evidence
anyone's
vote
was
changed
but
the
russians
did
compromise
a
few
key
systems
and
extract
some
data
and
less
than
six
months
before
voters
head
to
the
polls
in
early
primary
states
for
the
election
american
voting
is
stuck
in
a
paradox
states
have
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
security
improvements
and
yet
the
overall
system
remains
vulnerable
in
some
of
the
same
ways
it
was
four
years
ago

cybersecurity
expert
bruce
schneier
a
fellow
with
harvard's
berkman
center
for
internet
and
society
and
the
author
of
more
than
a
dozen
books
was
asked
how
much
security
has
improved
since
he
cut
off
the
question
oh
we
have
done
nothing
schneier
told
npr
we've
done
absolutely
nothing
he
isn't
being
literal
but
this
sentiment
was
pervasive
at
def
con
people
who
spend
their
lives
thinking
about
computer
security
said
they
feel
the
government
still
isn't
taking
the
threat
of
a
major
breach
seriously
enough
congress
allocated
million
towards
election
improvements
in
but
even
at
the
time
technical
experts
scoffed
at
what
they
called
such
a
low
number
because
technology
is
constantly
changing
cyber
advocates
say
new
funding
needs
to
arrive
regularly
not
as
a
once-in-a-decade
outpouring
of
cash
but
anxiety
about
election
security
has
run
headlong
into
broader
decades-old
partisan
divisions
about
practicing
democracy
gridlock
republicans
led
by
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
have
resisted
calls
for
large
amounts
of
new
funding
or
legislation
one
reason
is
principle
mcconnell
and
some
of
his
colleagues
argue
that
congress
should
not
federalize
a
practice
in
which
responsibility
now
rests
with
state
and
local
jurisdictions
around
the
country
another
objection
is
practical
the
government
did
a
good
job
safeguarding
the
midterm
elections
mcconnell
argues
which
ran
comparatively
smoothly
so
although
the
door
isn't
completely
closed
to
more
grants
or
other
work
by
congress
the
system
in
this
view
is
working
as
it
should
critics
tease
that
the
senate
majority
leader
is
moscow
mitch
alluding
to
supposed
softness
on
russia
that
nickname
rankles
mcconnell
who
called
it
over
the
top
in
an
interview
on
tuesday
with
hugh
hewitt
the
parties
differences
in
outlook
are
vast
oregon
democrat
sen
wyden
says
the
federal
government
should
take
control
over
how
the
country
votes
and
he
disagrees
with
the
every-state-for-itself
argument
i'll
be
damned
if
when
we're
up
against
the
russians
and
all
their
military
and
all
their
cybersecurity
might
we're
going
to
send
out
the
county
it
guy
wyden
told
a
crowded
conference
room
in
the
keynote
address
at
defcon
house
democrats
approved
a
bill
earlier
this
summer
that
would
authorize
more
than
million
in
election
security
grants
but
republicans
in
the
senate
have
made
it
clear
that
the
bill
has
no
future
why
hasn't
congress
fixed
the
problem
wyden
asked
rhetorically
two
words
mitch
mcconnell
the
confidence
issue
in
addition
to
the
money
allocated
by
congress
many
states
and
localities
have
also
put
their
own
resources
into
improving
their
election
systems
but
experts
say
the
system
is
only
as
strong
as
its
weakest
jurisdiction
so
improvements
done
in
a
piecemeal
way
could
just
make
it
clearer
which
states
and
counties
to
target
for
future
attacks
the
senate
intelligence
committee's
report
on
russian
election
interference
says
one
of
moscow's
goals
may
have
been
to
undermine
confidence
in
the
u.s.
elections
simply
through
the
discovery
of
their
activity
in
other
words
one
breach
even
without
actually
affecting
overall
results
can
give
the
impression
that
nothing
anywhere
can
be
trusted
the
other
side
of
that
coin
however
is
increased
awareness
one
of
the
largest
improvements
over
the
past
four
years
isn't
quantifiable
says
matt
olney
the
director
of
threat
intelligence
and
interdiction
at
cisco
he
says
general
awareness
of
cybersecurity
as
a
paramount
concern
for
election
officials
makes
the
u.s.
significantly
safer
heading
into
there's
no
conversations
anymore
about
whether
or
not
this
is
a
problem
said
olney
paper
one
glaring
vulnerability
which
cybersecurity
experts
have
been
talking
about
for
years
and
yelling
about
for
the
past
decade
are
paperless
voting
machines
experts
agree
that
these
machines
are
insecure
because
they
record
votes
electronically
and
could
either
be
manipulated
or
malfunction
without
detection
they
can't
truly
be
audited
and
they
leave
room
for
some
doubt
in
the
result
we
need
paper
ballots
percent
this
isn't
hard
this
isn't
controversial
as
scientists
we
know
exactly
what
we
need
schneier
said
getting
it
done
is
hard
the
u.s.
is
improving
in
this
area
but
work
isn't
complete
in
approximately
percent
of
voters
used
electronic
voting
equipment
that
didn't
provide
a
paper
trail
in
that
number
will
be
around
percent
according
a
recent
report
from
the
brennan
center
for
justice
the
largest
state
that
was
exclusively
using
paperless
electronic
machines
in
georgia
is
slated
to
replace
its
machines
with
touchscreen
equipment
that
provides
a
paper
record
before
but
even
after
the
election
it's
unclear
whether
there
will
be
the
urgency
to
overhaul
the
rest
of
the
systems
that
are
in
use
unless
there's
another
election-related
cyberattack
just
last
month
politico
reported
that
election
officials
in
counties
in
texas
will
either
be
sticking
with
their
existing
paperless
machines
some
of
them
almost
years
old
or
buying
new
paperless
ones
several
counties
said
they
wouldn't
upgrade
until
the
state
legislature
mandated
it
