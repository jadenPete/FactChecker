at

auditorium
in

last

elizabeth
warren
is
on
the
rise
among
democratic
voters
but
she
and
other
democrats
are
less
popular
with
the
overall
electorate
raising
concerns
about
a
bruising
primary
that
could
go
on
for
the
better
part
of

warren
on
the
rise
warren
finds
herself
in
a
strong
position
with
democratic
voters
ahead
of
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
seventy-five
percent
of
democratic
voters
now
say
they
have
a
favorable
impression
of
warren
that's
up
from
in
january
a
point
jump
from
the
last
time
the
poll
asked
the
favorability
of
candidates
or
potential
candidates
what's
more
the
percent
of
those
saying
they
have
a
negative
impression
has
gone
down
from
to
elizabeth
warren
seems
to
be
on
the
verge
of
starting
to
make
significant
and
serious
inroads
into
this
contest
said
lee
miringoff
director
of
the
marist
institute
for
public
opinion
which
conducts
the
poll
he
added
heading
into
the
debate
she's
very
well-positioned
biden
holding
up
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
leads
in
most
national
polls
of
the
democratic
contest
is
also
well-liked
but
he
has
seen
a
decline
since
january
of
democrats
say
they
have
a
positive
impression
of
biden
a
point
drop
and
don't
an
point
increase
in
his
negative
rating
one
of
the
initial
senses
of
what
joe
biden
presented
was
that
he
seemed
to
be
less
of
a
risk
miringoff
said
but
his
performance
so
far
has
not
been
gaffe-proof
and
as
a
result
people
are
not
as
comfortable
and
that
opened
up
the
door
for
others
and
particularly
warren
biden
has
been
taking
most
of
the
slings
and
arrows
of
his
democratic
opponents
given
his
lead
in
the
race
and
his
campaign
would
argue
that
he
has
held
up
well
considering
the
broader
electorate
isn't
quite
sold
on
either
biden
or
warren
biden
has
the
higher
name
recognition
and
voters
overall
give
him
just
a
favorable
unfavorable
rating
voters
are
similarly
split
on
warren
who
gets
a
favorable
and
unfavorable
rating
sanders
popular
with
the
base
but
not
the
general
electorate
bernie
sanders
who
has
retained
his
loyal
following
has
seen
an
increase
in
his
favorability
rating
among
democrats
since
officially
declaring
his
candidacy
the
vermont
senator
has
gone
from
positive
in
january
to
now
but
it's
a
different
story
with
the
broader
electorate
of
voters
say
they
have
an
unfavorable
impression
of
sanders
while
just
have
a
positive
one
bernie
sanders
having
over
negative
has
to
be
concerning
to
democrats
looking
for
electability
miringoff
noted
harris
is
now
better
known
but
also
unpopular
with
general
electorate
california
sen
kamala
harris
was
also
tested
but
the
difference
of
views
of
her
between
the
primary
and
general
election
electorate
are
most
striking
harris
has
gone
up
points
with
democrats
as
she
has
increased
her
name
recognition
going
from
favorable
in
january
to
now
back
then
more
than
half
of
democrats
were
either
unsure
or
never
heard
of
her
that's
down
to
just
a
quarter
of
democrats
now
so
she's
worn
well
with
democrats
but
not
with
a
general
electorate
so
far
among
registered
voters
she
has
a
favorable
unfavorable
rating
the
poll
did
not
test
the
favorability
of
the
candidates
with
a
general-election
electorate
back
in
january
when
you
look
at
the
national
electorate
miringoff
said
there's
still
a
lot
of
work
to
be
done
on
the
part
of
democrats
to
start
attracting
a
positive
reaction
democrats
want
to
beat
trump
how
the
candidates
fare
with
a
general-election
audience
could
be
critical
as
democrats
are
increasingly
saying
beating
trump
is
more
important
than
whether
a
candidate
shares
their
position
on
most
issues
in
this
poll
said
that
an
increase
from
in
july
and
in
june
the
broader
electorate
continues
to
be
split
on
whether
the
ideas
they've
heard
from
democrats
are
going
to
take
the
country
in
the
right
direction
or
the
wrong
one
that's
a
slight
improvement
from
july
when
it
was
the
mirror
opposite
still
more
independents
say
their
ideas
move
the
country
in
the
wrong
direction
than
right
one
president
trump
doesn't
fare
much
better
than
his
potential
democratic
opponents
his
overall
approval
rating
is
low
a
near-record
number
of
people
strongly
disapprove
of
the
job
he's
doing
a
record
number
disapprove
of
his
handling
of
foreign
policy
and
a
majority
say
they
will
definitely
vote
against
him
in
it's
the
economy
don't

what's
more
while
the
economy
is
buoying
trump
overall
and
of
independents
rate
it
as
excellent
or
good
he
has
seen
something
of
a
bad
economic
summer
while
the
economy
is
still
growing
and
unemployment
is
low
economic
forecasts
have
turned
gloomy
with
warning
signs
of
a
coming
recession
trump's
economic
handling
has
taken
a
hit
more
now
disapprove
than
approve
of
it
a
turnaround
from
july
when
a
majority
approved
of
his
handling
of
the
economy
don't

overall
americans
who
responded
were
split
to
on
whether
trump's
policies
have
strengthened
or
weakened
the
economy
and
the
number
of
people
who
think
his
policies
have
weakened
the
economy
has
increased
points
since
july
and
yet
don't

despite
all
that
more
americans
think
trump
will
win
reelection
than
lose
just
of
republicans
think
he
will
lose
while
of
democrats
think
he
will
win
and
are
unsure
independents
to
think
he's
going
to
win
methodology
the
survey
of
adults
was
conducted
with

callers
via

by
the
marist
poll
