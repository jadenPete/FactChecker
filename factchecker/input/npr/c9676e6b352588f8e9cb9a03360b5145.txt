after

recess
members
of
congress
return
to
washington
to
a
long
list
of
legislative
items
to

but
little
bipartisan
cooperation
to

lawmakers
are
back
on
capitol
hill
on
monday
after
an
extended
summer
recess
with
a
short
window
to
tackle
major
legislative
priorities
before
the
presidential
campaign
takes
center
stage
republicans
and
democrats
in
the
senate
and
house
need
to
approve
spending
bills
to
avoid
another
government
shutdown
they
also
hope
to
make
progress
on
policy
debates
that
have
been
languishing
for
months
the
white
house
is
pushing
congress
to
ratify
a
new
trade
deal
with
mexico
and
canada
and
leaders
want
to
show
voters
they
are
serious
about
proposals
to
lower
health
care
costs
a
string
of
mass
shootings
in
august
that
left
more
than
dead
also
added
a
contentious
debate
about
gun
control
measures
to
the
fall
agenda
but
the
ongoing
battle
royal
between
president
trump
and
house
democrats
about
investigations
into
his
administration
and
increasing
calls
for
his
impeachment
make
bipartisan
cooperation
a
tall
order
in
a
divided
congress
here's
an
overview
of
what
congress
plans
to
address
this
fall
guns
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
a
longtime
supporter
of
second
amendment
rights
ignored
the
bill
expanding
federal
background
checks
that
the
democrat-controlled
house
passed
in
february
but
after
several
late
summer
mass
shootings
president
trump
publicly
said
he
wanted
congress
to
act
in
early
august
and
mcconnell
said
the
senate
would
debate
a
range
of
issues
after
the
summer
break
democrats
spent
weeks
urging
mcconnell
to
call
the
senate
back
but
he
emphasized
that
he
would
only
advance
gun
legislation
that
the
president
backed
in
an
interview
last
week
mcconnell
reiterated
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
president
to
clarify
which
proposals
he
would
get
behind
in
september
before
allowing
votes
on
the
senate
floor
the
white
house
has
been
talking
with
sen
pat
toomey
r-pa
and
sen
joe
manchin
d-w
va
the
two
senators
pushing
a
background
check
bill
about
their
bill
there
are
also
bipartisan
efforts
to
pass
legislation
that
gives
grants
to
states
to
implement
red
flag
laws
measures
that
allow
law
enforcement
to
temporarily
remove
guns
from
those
who
could
pose
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
but
the
president
has
reversed
himself
in
the
weeks
following
the
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
and
without
his
express
support
the
debate
is
stalled
the
leadership
of
the
national
rifle
association
has
had
a
direct
line
to
president
trump
and
is
opposed
to
the
current
proposals
circulating
on
the
hill
republicans
have
largely
stayed
silent
on
what
they
are
ready
to
support
without
cover
from
trump
few
lawmakers
are
eager
to
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
nra
which
has
been
a
powerful
force
in
national
election
cycles
house
democrats
aren't
waiting
on
a
deal
with
the
white
house
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
expected
to
advance
three
bills
this
week
one
giving
incentives
to
states
for
red
flag
laws
one
banning
high
capacity
magazines
for
firearms
and
one
banning
firearm
sales
to
individuals
with
misdemeanor
hate
crime
convictions
the
committee
is
also
holding
a
hearing
later
in
the
month
on
legislation
banning
assault
weapons
it's
likely
the
full
house
will
vote
on
those
proposals
this
fall
in
an
effort
to
pressure
the
senate
to
act
spending
president
trump
signed
a
two-year
budget
bill
earlier
this
summer
setting
the
top-line
numbers
for
defense
and
domestic
programs
that
deal
removes
a
major
hurdle
for
negotiators
on
the
appropriations
committees
who
are
allocating
specific
agency
budgets
but
both
chambers
still
need
to
approve
the
spending
bills
for
federal
agencies
the
house
has
already
passed
the
bulk
of
these
but
the
senate
still
has
to
move
its
own
versions
with
the
deadline
to
avoid
another
shutdown
looming
on
sept
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
announced
the
house
would
vote
in
mid-september
on
a
stopgap
funding
bill
to
keep
agencies
funded
through
sometime
later
this
fall
as
the
two
chambers
negotiate
final
spending
bills
as
we
wait
for
them
to
complete
their
work
so
that
we
can
begin
conference
negotiations
a
continuing
resolution
will
be
necessary
to
prevent
another
government
shutdown
like
the
one
we
experienced
earlier
this
year
which
harmed
thousands
of
american
families
hoyer
said
in
a
letter
to
house
democrats
last
week
senate
republicans
have
not
said
whether
they
support
the
house's
bill
or
whether
they
will
move
a
separate
measure
any
effort
to
tack
on
money
for
a
border
wall
or
other
gop
priorities
to
a
spending
bill
could
potentially
trigger
another
shutdown
prescription
drug
prices
republicans
and
democrats
both
say
one
of
voters
chief
concerns
is
the
high
cost
of
prescription
drugs
but
their
policy
proposals
on
how
to
bring
costs
down
are
significantly
far
apart
democrats
want
to
impose
government
regulations
while
gop
lawmakers
are
reluctant
to
interfere
in
free
markets
president
trump
has
vowed
that
lowering
drug
costs
is
a
key
theme
heading
into
his
reelection
bid
the
trump
administration
has
taken
some
executive
action
to
impose
new
rules
for
drug
companies
but
they
have
had
little
impact
so
far
because
they
are
still
going
through
the
rule-making
process
or
mired
in
legal
challenges
efforts
to
tackle
the
issue
have
faltered
for
years
with
the
powerful
drug
lobby
spending
millions
to
oppose
major
reforms
on
capitol
hill
senate
finance
committee
chairman
chuck
grassley
r-iowa
led
the
effort
to
move
a
bipartisan
bill
through
his
committee
in
july
but
most
republicans
on
the
panel
opposed
that
plan
it
included
price
controls
on
the
pharmaceutical
industry
limiting
their
ability
to
raise
drug
prices
faster
than
the
rate
of
inflation
house
democrats
are
planning
to
unveil
their
own
proposal
later
this
month
that
will
focus
on
medicare
negotiating
drug
prices
in
an
approach
designed
to
lower
costs
for
consumers
in
both
government
and
private
health
care
systems
it's
likely
the
issue
will
be
a
central
one
in
congressional
races
next
fall
it's
the
focus
of
a
political
campaign
commercial
in
a
special
election
for
a
house
seat
in
north
carolina
where
the
democratic
candidate
is
accusing
his
gop
opponent
of
siding
with
wealthy
drug
company
ceos
over
cancer
patients
trade
the
president
is
aggressively
pushing
congress
to
ratify
the
united
states-mexico-canada
agreement
known
as
usmca
this
fall
a
trade
war
with
china
ratcheted
up
over
the
summer
and
lawmakers
representing
farmers
and
manufacturers
impacted
by
new
tariffs
are
eager
to
finalize
the
deal
they
hope
will
significantly
increase
u.s.
exports
and
boost
job
creation
but
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
insists
that
the
deal
needs
stronger
enforcement
provisions
she
has
specifically
called
for
those
related
to
labor
standards
prescription
drug
prices
and
environmental
protections
the
president's
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
has
been
in
regular
contact
with
pelosi
for
months
a
working
group
of
house
democrats
tapped
in
june
by
the
speaker
has
been
working
to
get
the
administration
to
make
changes
to
the
agreement
pelosi
has
also
talked
with
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
about
her
concerns
mcconnell
continues
to
press
pelosi
to
move
forward
with
the
deal
saying
there
is
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
for
it
in
the
senate
the
formal
agreement
hasn't
been
transmitted
to
congress
and
if
it
slips
into
it
is
far
less
likely
that
it
will
get
approved
democrats
will
be
reluctant
to
give
the
president
a
win
on
one
of
his
key
campaign
promises
just
months
before
voters
decide
whether
he
deserves
a
second
term
investigations
and
impeachment
multiple
house
committees
continue
to
investigate
president
trump's
finances
businesses
and
administration
policies
despite
a
flurry
of
subpoenas
to
top
white
house
officials
and
former
campaign
aides
the
democrats
efforts
to
obtain
documents
have
been
largely
stonewalled
and
few
witnesses
have
agreed
to
appear
even
during
the
summer
recess
both
the
house
judiciary
and
oversight
panels
continued
to
pile
on
more
issues
they
are
examining
including
the
vice
president's
decision
to
stay
at
a
trump-owned
resort
during
an
official
visit
to
ireland
proponents
of
impeaching
the
president
hoped
to
use
the
summer
recess
to
drum
up
pressure
on
those
democrats
who
haven't
publicly
backed
moving
ahead
one
marker
impeachment
advocates
can
hold
up
is
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
house
democrats
are
now
publicly
calling
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
but
recent
public
opinion
polls
indicate
that
the
majority
of
americans
oppose
impeachment
pelosi
who
will
ultimately
determine
whether
the
house
proceeds
is
against
any
formal
impeachment
effort
until
the
strong
case
is
built
and
the
public
is
on
board
she
recently
restated
her
view
to
house
democrats
on
a
conference
call
emphasizing
that
the
public
support
isn't
there
yet
