president
trump
spoke
with
reporters
before
departing
from
the
white
house
on
marine
one
he
said
he
is
open
to
changes
to
gun
purchase
policies
but
those
prospects
aren't
clear
president
trump
said
he
is
willing
to
get
behind
some
changes
to
background
checks
for
gun
buyers
as
long
as
democrats
don't
move
the
goalposts
and
lead
him
down
a
slippery
slope
the
president
told
reporters
on
wednesday
that
he
continues
to
support
new
or
altered
checks
without
going
into
detail
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
has
been
taking
counsel
on
the
issue
from
the
national
rifle
association
trump
confirmed
he
had
spoken
with
nra
ceo
wayne
lapierre
on
tuesday
but
not
some
news
accounts
that
suggested
the
two
men
had
agreed
there
would
be
no
movement
on
background
checks
instead
trump
said
he
and
lapierre
mostly
talked
about
concepts
and
certain
weaknesses
we
want
to
fix
in
the
current
process
for
buying
guns
trump
suggested
he
was
willing
to
negotiate
something
with
democrats
assuming
they
really
want
to
get
this
done
we
can
get
this
done
precisely
what
this
might
involve
isn't
clear
as
trump
and
democrats
appear
far
apart
on
gun
proposals
following
the
mass
shootings
earlier
this
month
in
texas
and
ohio
political
leaders
on
either
end
of
pennsylvania
avenue
have
suggested
they
would
be
open
to
new
gun
policies
including
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
but
one
difficulty
in
understanding
the
state
of
play
has
been
trump's
own
changing
position
two
weeks
ago
he
wrote
on
twitter
that
republicans
and
democrats
must
come
together
and
get
strong
background
checks
after
his
phone
call
with
the
nra
leader
on
tuesday
trump
played
down
the
need
for
such
action
we
have
very
very
strong
background
checks
right
now
trump
told
reporters
in
the
oval
office
continued
trump
but
we
have
sort
of
missing
areas
and
areas
that
don't
complete
the
whole
circle
and
we're
looking
at
different
things
and
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
is
a
mental
problem
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
person
that
pulls
the
trigger
then
on
wednesday
the
president
repeated
some
of
those
points
and
added
that
what
he
feared
was
a
tactic
by
democrats
in
which
they
opened
negotiations
but
then
insisted
on
elements
that
would
take
any
bill
beyond
the
point
he
was
willing
to
support
opponents
call
for
new
action
democrats
say
the
recent
shootings
reinforce
the
need
for
significant
new
action
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
announced
it
will
return
to
washington
early
to
take
up
legislation
on
red
flag
laws
and
assault
weapons
for
years
democrats
have
worked
with
the
survivors
of
gun
violence
on
legislation
and
promised
that
we
would
never
stop
until
we
got
the
job
done
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
wrote
to
lawmakers
this
month
public
sentiment
is
in
favor
of
gun
violence
prevention
she
said
the
american
people
must
weigh
in
with
the
congress
and
the
president
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
also
faulted
what
they
called
trump's
capitulation
to
gun
rights
groups
trump
isn't
in
charge
the
nra
is
wrote
california
sen
kamala
harris
former
vice
president
joe
biden
vowed
that
if
he
is
elected
not
only
will
he
pursue
universal
background
checks
but
he
will
also
reinstate
the
assault
weapons
ban
trouble
inside
the
association
the
president's
adoption
of
the
nra's
leitmotif
that
guns
don't
kill
people
people
kill
people
underscored
the
enduring
influence
of
the
gun
rights
group
even
as
it
also
undergoes
significant
internal
turmoil
for
example
on
the
same
day
that
lapierre
spoke
with
the
president
two
nra
board
members
decided

resign

childress

not
refer
to
the
internal
power
struggles

the
multiple

it
is
necessary
for

to
fully

letter
obtained
by

my
hope
is
that
the
nra
will
move
forward
with
a
focus
on
its
important
mission
amid
allegations
of
financial
impropriety
the
new
york
and
washington
d.c.
attorneys
general
have
launched
investigations
into
the
organization
this
comes
in
addition
to
numerous
congressional
probes
into
its
finances
morgan's
and
childress
resignations
bring
the
number
of
resignations
from
the
board
to
seven
out
of
a
total
of
board
members
a
number
of
board
members
have
resigned
in
recent
weeks
in
part
because
of
what
they
claim
is
an
inability
to
get
straight
answers
about
the
group's
financial
situation
