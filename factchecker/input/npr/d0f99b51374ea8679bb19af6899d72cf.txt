oct
federal
election
said
the
prime
minister's
photo
was
racist
in
and
is
racist
in
what
canadians
saw
this
evening

someone
with
a
complete
lack
of
judgment
and
integrity
and
someone
who
is
not
fit
to
govern
this
country
scheer
was
quoted
as
saying
by
the
associated

trudeau

of
his
life
against

and
intolerance

he
recognizes
the
brownface
makeup
was
racist
