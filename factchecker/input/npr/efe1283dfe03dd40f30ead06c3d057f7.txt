something
is
strange
with
the
economy
normally
in
good
times
the
government
seeks
to
balance
its
books
a
bit
borrowing
less
paying
off
some
debt
or
gasp
maybe
even
aiming
for
a
budget
surplus
and
right
now
on
some
important
measures
economic
times
are
good
but
the
government
has
been
increasing
spending
and
cutting
taxes
and
the
budget
deficit
is
projected
to
grow
to
nearly
trillion
an
increase
of
over
since
the
tax
cuts
and
jobs
act
was
passed
in
meanwhile
the
federal
reserve
would
normally
be
raising
interest
rates
to
make
sure
the
price
of
everything
doesn't
get
out
of
control
but
high
inflation
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
fed
is
now
cutting
interest
rates
we're
living
in
the
upside
down
you
know
like
that
shadowy
land
in
stranger
things
where
the
laws
of
physics
don't
apply
and
monsters
might
eat
you
it's
an
alternate
dimension
where
economic
textbooks
are
being
thrown
out
the
window
a
scary
place
where
despite
big
deficits
and
easy
money
the
economy
is
slowing
down
to
a
rate
below
historical
averages
and
wage
growth
remains
disappointing
and
it's
a
place
where
frightening
monsters
or
demogorgons
continue
to
scare
away
investment
and
productivity
slaying
these
monsters
is
the
key
to
growth
and
prosperity
but
we
seem
to
be
stuck
in
this
new
world
where
investment
and
productivity
will
not
come
roaring
back
can
we
escape
in
economist
alvin
hansen
then
the
president
of
the
american
economic
association
gave
a
speech
in
detroit
at
the
organization's
annual
meeting
it
had
been
almost
a
decade
since
a
stock
market
crash
had
ushered
in
the
great
depression
the
recovery
had
been
puny
and
the
economy
had
just
dipped
into
yet
another
recession
things
were
looking
bad
this
is
the
essence
of
secular
stagnation
hansen
said
sick
recoveries
which
die
in
their
infancy
and
depressions
which
feed
on
themselves
and
leave
a
hard
and
seemingly
immovable
core
of
unemployment
hansen
used
the
term
secular
not
in
the
way
normal
people
use
it
he
didn't
mean
nonreligious
he
meant
the
third
definition
provided
by
merriam-webster
of
or
relating
to
a
long
term
of
indefinite
duration
and
so
by
secular
stagnation
he
meant
a
long-term
period
of
crappy
economic
growth
this
upside
down
economy
was
the
product
hansen
said
of
a
shriveling
population
the
closing
of
the
frontier
and
the
maturing
of
industries
the
economy
had
basically
grown
up
there
was
nowhere
left
to
go
this
situation
depressed
economic
demand
and
in
particular
demand
for
investment
factories
machines
houses
cubicles
and
other
stuff
capital
that
expands
the
economy
he
looked
spot
on
for
a
bit
but
then
came
world
war
ii
which
saw
an
explosion
of
government
spending
and
when
the
war
ended
america
saw
a
baby
boom
technological
innovations
and
a
huge
growth
in
demand
for
new
products
from
wood-paneled
station
wagons
to
tv
dinners
to
slinkys
this
booming
economy
fed
higher
investment
and
productivity
and
wage
growth
and
america
transported
back
to
the
pretty
world
of
standard
economic
theory
the
postwar
years
proved
to
be
far
from
stagnant
and
the
idea
of
secular
stagnation
was
thrown
in
a
newly
patented
trash
compactor
fast-forward
to
and
former
treasury
secretary
larry
summers
fresh
from
his
stint
as
director
of
the
national
economic
council
in
the
obama
administration
resurrected
the
term
at
a
speech
at
the
international
monetary
fund
in
washington
d.c.
and
he
has
been
warning
the
world
about
it
ever
since
secular
stagnation
he
says
may
be
the
defining
macro-economic
challenge
of
our
times
like
hansen
in
the
s
summers
points
to
declining
population
growth
as
one
source
of
stagnation
but
he
also
points
to
other
factors
a
big
one
our
economy
might
require
less
investment
than
it
used
to
think
kodak
the
old
economy
vs
instagram
the
new
economy
kodak
required
factories
and
assembly
line
workers
and
trucks
and
film
and
film
developers
and
a
bunch
of
other
resources
to
give
us
photography
instagram
basically
needs
just
an
office
with
laptops
and
a
few
hundred
smart
workers
it
needs
much
less
investment
meanwhile
there
are
a
lot
of
savings
out
there
looking
for
a
return
and
there
don't
seem
to
be
enough
investment
opportunities
to
sop
it
all
up
as
we
explained
in
last
week's
planet
money
newsletter
a
shortage
of
investment
relative
to
a
glut
of
savings
is
why
we're
now
in
the
upside-down
world
of
super-low
interest
rates
summers
warns
that
this
world
of
disappointing
growth
and
super-low
interest
rates
means
it
will
be
hard
for
traditional
tools
like
the
fed's
cutting
of
interest
rates
to
rescue
us
from
future
recessions
and
it
could
mean
the
only
way
we'll
get
solid
growth
is
if
the
government
attaches
the
rocket
boosters
of
deficit
spending
and
cheap
credit
to
the
economy
even
then
it
might
look
just
ok-ish
secular
stagnation
does
have
an
upside
actually
low
interest
rates
mean
it's
supercheap
to
borrow
that
includes
for
the
government
not
only
that
but
the
government
might
be
able
to
rack
up
big
deficits
and
give
us
tons
of
cheap
credit
and
not
cause
runaway
inflation
that's
why
respected
folks
like
the
former
chief
economist
of
the
imf
olivier
blanchard
are
discarding
the
old
rules
and
saying
that
deficits
don't
matter
like
they
used
to
secular
stagnationistas
are
arguing
that
now
is
the
time
to
spend
big
on
things
like
roads
bridges
and
a
green
new
deal
that's
one
way
to
increase
investment
in
the
economy
and
get
us
out
of
this
hole
of
course
many
disagree
they
have
faith
that
new
technologies
in
the
pipeline
will
expand
industry
increase
investment
and
productivity
and
rescue
us
from
stagnation
summers
makes
clear
that
he
believes
secular
stagnation
is
not
new
japan
has
seen
it
for
decades
before
the
financial
crisis
the
u.s.
had
tax
cuts
deficit
spending
two
wars
and
massive
housing
and
debt
bubbles
and
the
economy
still
didn't
look
amazing
in
other
words
it's
possible
that
we're
not
living
in
the
upside
down
this
is
the
right-side
up
the
normal
place
and
those
roaring
periods
of
the
past
when
job-creating
technologies
baby
booms
and
expanding
frontiers
all
rocketed
our
economy
to
good
times
were
in
fact
the
alternate
dimension
