speaks
with
reporters
about

whistleblower
complaint
on
thursday
ahead
of
a
week
when
president
trump
will
have
his
first
face-to-face
meeting
with
the
ukrainian
president
democratic
calls
for
investigation
of
trump's
communications
with
ukraine
have
intensified
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
agreed
to
testify
in
open
session
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
about
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
has
deemed
credible
and
urgent
multiple
news
outlets
have
reported
that
the
complaint
concerns
trump's
communications
with
ukraine
trump
urged
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
to
investigate
joe
biden's
son
hunter
about
eight
times
in
a
july
phone
call
according
to
reporting
in
the
wall
street
journal
house
democrats
are
also
investigating
whether
that
pressure
coincided
with
the
withholding
of
military
aid
from
ukraine
the
trump
administration
approved
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
this
month
but
lawmakers
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
had
expressed
concern
about
the
administration's
delay
in
approving
that
money
the
trump
administration
has
doubled
down
on
its
insistence
that
trump
did
nothing
wrong
but
the
allegations
about
trump's
requests
of
ukrainian
leadership
have
led
some
democrats
to
reaffirm
calls
for
impeachment
by
failing
to
act
congress
is
complicit
in
trump's
latest
attempt
to
solicit
foreign
interference
to
aid
him
in
us
elections
presidential
candidate
elizabeth
warren
tweeted
on
friday
do
your
constitutional
duty
and
impeach
the
president
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
told
cnn
on
sunday
that
he
has
previously
been
hesitant
to
advocate
for
impeaching
trump
schiff
said
he
thinks
it's
important
to
make
clear
to
the
public
that
impeachment
is
something
democrats
pursue
reluctantly
but
schiff
said
if
trump
did
pressure
ukraine
into
investigating
a
political
opponent
impeachment
could
be
appropriate
this
would
be
i
think
the
most
profound
violation
of
the
presidential
oath
of
office
certainly
during
this
presidency
which
says
a
lot
but
perhaps
during
just
about
any
presidency
schiff
said
notably
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
still
has
not
called
for
impeachment
pelosi
did
however
issue
a
statement
on
sunday
warning
the
administration
against
withholding
the
full
contents
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
if
the
administration
persists
in
blocking
this
whistleblower
from
disclosing
to
congress
a
serious
possible
breach
of
constitutional
duties
by
the
president
they
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
pelosi
wrote
house
democrats
say
they
are
legally
entitled
to
see
the
full
complaint
in
remarks
delivered
thursday
schiff
said
the
director
of
national
intelligence
is
supposed
to
provide
that
information
to
congress
but
so
far
has
not
we
do
not
have
the
complaint
we
do
not
know
whether
the
press
reports
are
accurate
or
inaccurate
about
the
contents
of
that
complaint
said
schiff
constitutional
law
expert
jonathan
turley
told
npr's
rachel
martin
that
there
could
be
a
court
fight
over
whether
the
trump
administration
is
required
to
disclose
to
congress
the
substance
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
there's
good
arguments
on
both
sides
turley
said
but
congress
clearly
has
legitimate
interest
in
finding
greater
details
as
to
what
was
said
to
this
ukrainian
figure
speaking
sunday
on
cnn
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
a
congressional
investigation
into
the
whistleblower
complaint
would
set
a
terrible
precedent
conversations
between
world
leaders
are
meant
to
be
confidential
mnuchin
said
if
every
time
someone
for
political
reasons
raised
a
question
and
all
of
a
sudden
those
conversations
were
disclosed
publicly
then
why
would
world
leaders
want
to
have
conversations
together
trump
told
reporters
on
sunday
that
his
phone
call
with
zelenskiy
was
absolutely
perfect
and
that
he
did
absolutely
nothing
wrong
trump
said
his
conversation
with
zelenskiy
focused
on
corruption
and
on
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
contributing
to
the
corruption
already
in
ukraine
when
asked
whether
his
administration
would
release
a
transcript
of
his
conversation
with
zelenskiy
trump
said
he's
going
to
talk
about
it
i
love
it
he
said
referring
to
the
contents
of
the
conversation
but
you
have
to
be
a
little
bit
shy
about
doing
that
trump
emphasized
his
belief
that
world
leaders
should
be
able
to
speak
freely
in
conversations
with
each
other
trump
also
told
reporters
that
he
would
have
no
problem
with
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
testifying
before
congress
asked
late
thursday
night
whether
he
asked
ukraine
to
look
into
joe
biden
giuliani
responded
of
course
i
did
trump
and
his
allies
claim
that
while
joe
biden
was
vice
president
he
inappropriately
sought
to
have
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
fired
the
prosecutor
was
reportedly
looking
into
biden's
son
hunter's
business
affairs
because
in
hunter
biden
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
energy
company
ukraine's
prosecutor
general
has
said
there
was
no
evidence
that
either
biden
had
done
anything
improper
i
do
not
want
ukraine
to
again
be
the
subject
of
u.s.
presidential
elections
ukrainian
prosecutor
general
yuriy
lutsenko
told
bloomberg
news
in
may
hunter
biden
did
not
violate
any
ukrainian
laws
at
least
as
of
now
we
do
not
see
any
wrongdoing
it
seems
that
for
the
moment
ukraine
is
very
much
again
the
subject
of
a
u.s.
presidential
election
at
the
polk
county
iowa
steak
fry
on
saturday
joe
biden
said
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
biden
said
trump
confirmed
sunday
that
he
will
meet
with
zelenskiy
the
ukrainian
president
this
week
at
the
u.n.
general
assembly
in
new
york
when
asked
by
reporters
sunday
whether
he
will
mention
joe
biden
at
that
meeting
trump
said
i
won't
be
mentioning
much
