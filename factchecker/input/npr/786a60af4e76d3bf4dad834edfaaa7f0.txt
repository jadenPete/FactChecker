options
for
small

in

gathering
at

in

while
many
capitol
hill
republicans
would
like
to
avoid
another
public
debate
about
whether
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
president
trump
and
his
appointees
keep
bringing
it
up
promising
their
own
health
plan
that
would
be
phenomenal
and
make
the
gop
the
party
of
health
care
we're
actively
engaged
in
conversations
on
what
to
do
medicare
chief
seema
verma
said
last
month
and
trump
adviser
kellyanne
conway
has
indicated
a
health
care
announcement
might
come
in
september
behind
the
pronouncements
lies
a
dilemma
whether
or
not
to
stray
beyond
efforts
underway
to
improve
the
nation's
health
care
system
loosening
insurance
regulations
talking
about
drug
prices
and
expanding
tax-free
health
savings
accounts
to
develop
an
overarching
plan
for
the
white
house
it's
a
fraught
decision
a
comprehensive
plan
could
serve
as
a
lightning
rod
for
opponents
conversely
not
having
a
plan
for
replacing
some
of
the
most
popular
parts
of
obamacare
such
as
its
coverage
protections
for
people
with
preexisting
medical
conditions
could
leave
the
gop
flatfooted
if
an
administration-supported
lawsuit
now
before
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
were
to
invalidate
the
sweeping
health
law
this
is
a
real
conundrum
says
dean
rosen
a
washington
d.c.
health
policy
consultant
who
often
advises
republicans
there
is
a
risk
with
action
or
inaction
no
matter
how
the
th
circuit
rules
its
decision
which
could
come
soon
is
likely
to
be
stayed
while
the
issue
heads
to
the
supreme
court
such
a
delay
would
give
the
trump
administration
time
to
flesh
out
a
proposal
if
the
appeals
judges
throw
out
the
aca
but
it
would
also
ensure
that
a
health
care
debate
is
front
and
center
during
the
presidential
campaign
right
now
polls
show
the
public
is
focused
on
health
costs
says
professor
robert
blendon
director
of
the
harvard
opinion
research
program
which
studies
public
knowledge
of
health
care
and
policy
issues
consumers
are
concerned
about
what
they
pay
at
the
pharmacy
counter
or
about
the
sum
of
their
insurance
premiums
and
deductibles
most
voters
are
not
interested
in
another
debate
on
a
new
health
plan
blendon
says
but
if
the
th
circuit
upholds
a
texas
ruling
overturning
the
entire
aca
that
changes
the
entire
framework
he
adds
the
administration
could
not
just
say
oh
we'll
have
something
great
they
would
have
to
have
something
outlined
supporters
and
critics
say
likely
elements
are
already
in
plain
sight
both
in
executive
actions
and
proposals
in
the
president's
budget
as
well
as
in
a
little-noticed
interagency
white
paper
released
late
last
year
called
reforming
american's
health
care
system
through
choice
and
competition
the
president
has
won
praise
both
from
conservatives
and
from
liberals
for
initiatives
such
as
his
proposal
to
require
hospitals
to
post
their
actual
negotiated
prices
and
some
strategies
to
lower
drug
prices
but
legal
battles
from
industry
could
thwart
such
initiatives
on
these
topics
a
lot
of
what
they've
proposed
has
been
pretty
smart
says
shawn
gremminger
senior
director
of
federal
relations
at
the
liberal
families
usa
advocacy
group
still
gremminger
points
to
other
administration
actions
such
as
loosening
rules
on
health
insurers
to
allow
sales
of
what
critics
call
junk
insurance
policies
because
they
don't
have
all
the
consumer
protections
of
aca
policies
or
promoting
work
requirements
for
medicaid
recipients
as
strong
hints
to
what
might
be
in
any
eventual
election-related
plan
i
think
what
we'll
see
is
a
lot
of
that
same
sort
of
stuff
warmed
over
and
put
into
a
new
package
gremminger
says
we
fully
expect
it
will
include
a
lot
of
really
terrible
ideas
for
other
policy
clues
some
trump
advisers
like
brian
blase
a
former
special
assistant
to
the
president
at
the
national
economic
council
now
with
the
texas
public
policy
foundation
say
look
no
further
than
that
interagency
report
the
page
document
a
joint
publication
of
the
u.s.
departments
of
labor
treasury
and
health
and
human
services
includes
more
than
two
dozen
recommendations
that
broadly
focus
on
loosening
federal
and
state
regulations
limiting
hospital
and
insurer
market
power
and
prompting
patients
to
be
more
price-conscious
shoppers
many
are
long-standing
free
market
favorites
of
republicans
such
as
increasing
the
use
of
health
savings
accounts
which
allow
consumers
to
set
aside
money
tax-free
to
cover
medical
expenses
other
ideas
are
not
typically
associated
with
the
gop
such
as
increased
federal
scrutiny
of
mergers
of
hospitals
and
insurers
such
mergers
have
driven
up
prices
the
white
paper
also
calls
for
easing
restrictions
on
medicare
advantage
plans
which
offer
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
fee-for-service
medicare
the
trump
proposal
would
allow
the
advantage
program
to
have
smaller
networks
of
doctors
and
hospitals
presumably
ones
that
agreed
to
charge
less
the
administration
knows
where
it
is
going
on
health
care
blase
says
if
the
court
strikes
down
the
aca
he
expects
the
administration
to
release
a
plan
supporting
generously
funded
state-based
high-risk
pools
such
pools
existed
in
most
states
before
the
aca
they
helped
provide
coverage
for
people
with
preexisting
conditions
who
were
denied
policies
by
insurers
but
the
pools
were
expensive
so
they
often
were
underfunded
capping
members
benefits
and
producing
long
waiting
lists
not
everyone
thinks
the
white
paper
is
a
plan
but
more
of
a
combination
of
policy
ideas
and
political
statements
says
joe
antos
at
the
conservative-leaning
american
enterprise
institute
still
he
doubts
the
gop
needs
a
comprehensive
health
proposal
republicans
are
more
likely
to
gain
politically
by
merely
attacking
the
democrats
ideas
antos
says
especially
if
the
democratic
nominee
backs
proposals
for
a
fully
government-funded
health
care
system
such
as
the
medicare
for
all
plans
some
candidates
support
republicans
will
have
their
own
one-liners
saying
they
are
dedicated
to
protecting
people
with
preexisting
conditions
that
might
be
enough
for
a
lot
of
people
antos
says
politically
taking
on
the
affordable
care
act
or
not
taking
it
on
are
both
risky
while
many
voters
don't
understand
all
that
the
federal
health
law
does
some
of
its
rules
enjoy
broad
support
that's
particularly
true
of
the
protections
for
people
with
medical
problems
under
the
current
law
insurers
are
barred
from
rejecting
them
for
coverage
or
charging
them
more
than
people
without
such
conditions
the
republican
effort
to
repeal
the
aca
galvanized
activists
during
the
midterm
elections
and
is
credited
with
boosting
democrats
to
victory
in
many
house
districts
analysts
on
both
sides
expect
concerns
about
health
costs
and
health
law
to
play
a
large
role
again
in
for
republicans
the
risk
of
doing
nothing
potentially
leaves
no
port
in
a
storm
if
the
aca
is
overturned
legally
rosen
says
but
a
more
limited
version
which
is
what
most
republicans
are
for
is
likely
to
be
met
with
the
same
concerns
no
matter
what
the
president
says
it
won't
be
enough
for
the
democrats
opinion
poll
analyst
blendon
says
there
is
an
additional
unknown
which
democrat
will
win
the
nomination
and
what
type
of
coverage
will
she
or
he
back
even
as
the
gop
is
split
on
how
to
address
health
care
concerns
so
too
are
the
democrats
if
they
are
reading
the
same
polling
data
as
i
am
they
would
have
serious
proposals
for
lowering
drug
and
hospital
costs
but
not
offer
a
national
health
plan
blendon
says
the
democrats
most
progressive
wing
led
by
sens
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
and
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
wants
medicare
for
all
which
would
essentially
eliminate
private
and
job-based
coverage
recent
polls
have
shown
voters
are
not
keen
on
losing
private
insurance
the
party's
center
led
by
former
vice
president
joe
biden
wants
to
keep
the
aca
but
apply
fixes
to
make
insurance
purchased
by
individuals
more
affordable
if
the
democratic
nominee
is
running
on
keeping
the
aca
the
republican
will
have
to
have
an
alternative
blendon
says
but
if
the
nominee
supports
medicare
for
all
blendon
predicts
simply
a
gop
anti-campaign
targeting
the
democrat's
idea
as
unworkable
socialist
or
a
danger

medicare
