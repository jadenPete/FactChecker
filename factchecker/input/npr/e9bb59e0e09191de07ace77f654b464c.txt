the
first
thing
melissa
hanham
did
when
she
saw
president
trump's
tweet
last
week
was
take
a
screen
grab
my
reaction
was
to
immediately
save
the
image
to
my
phone
just
in
case
it
got
taken
down
she
says
the
wording
on
the
tweet
was
cryptic
the
united
states
of
america
was
not
involved
in
the
catastrophic
accident
during
final
launch
preparations
for
the
safir
space
launch
vehicle
launch
at
semnan
launch
site
one
in
iran
the
president
said
i
wish
iran
best
wishes
and
good
luck
in
determining
what
happened
at
site
one
but
it
was
the
photo
that
left
hanham
a
satellite
imagery
expert
gobsmacked
the
day
before
on
aug
a
rocket
had
exploded
at
the
imam
khomeini
space
center
in
northern
iran
trump's
tweet
contained
an
incredibly
sharp
image
of
the
aftermath
visible
were
burned-out
vehicles
and
lettering
around
the
edge
of
the
pad
that
couldn't
be
seen
clearly
in
commercial
satellite
photos
hanham
deputy
director
of
the
open
nuclear
network
in
vienna
says
she
has
seen
lots
of
images
over
the
years
but
never
anything
like
this
it
was
so
crystal
clear
and
high-resolution
that
i
did
not
believe
it
could
have
come
from
a
satellite
she
says
there
are
still
few
details
about
how
the
image
made
its
way
to
trump's
twitter
account
the
president
received
his
daily
intelligence
briefing
at
a
m
et
about
two
hours
before
the
tweet
cnbc
reported
that
trump
was
shown
the
photo
during
the
briefing
a
flash
visible
in
the
center
of
the
image
suggests
trump
or
someone
else
took
a
photo
of
the
original
image
which
hanham
says
might
have
been
the
intelligence
briefing
slide
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
referred
questions
about
the
image
to
the
white
house
we
had
a
photo
and
i
released
it
which
i
have
the
absolute
right
to
do
trump
told
reporters
late
friday
such
a
disclosure
of
classified
information
by
anyone
but
the
president
would
end
in
jail
time
says
bruce
klingner
a
former
cia
officer
now
at
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
anyone
else
who
revealed
it
would
be
sitting
in
leavenworth
prison
serving
out
a
prison
term
klingner
says
but
in
the
world
of
classified
secrets
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
absolute
power
the
classification
system
for
national
security
information
is
not
based
in
a
law
it
derives
from
the
president's
own
status
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
armed
forces
says
steven
aftergood
who
studies
government
secrecy
at
the
federation
of
american
scientists
the
rules
about
classification
are
laid
out
in
very
detailed
presidential
orders
as
part
of
a
system
run
by
the
executive
branch
and
trump
is
the
boss
he
therefore
has
the
authority
to
decide
unilaterally
what
will
be
disclosed
what
will
be
declassified
and
what
will
not
aftergood
says
past
presidents
have
used
this
power
sparingly
president
bill
clinton
authorized
the
release
of
some
satellite
images
during
the
balkans
conflict
in
the
s
in
secretary
of
state
colin
powell
used
satellite
photos
in
his
speech
at
the
u.n.
to
build
a
case
for
war
with
iraq
but
aftergood
thinks
the
images
in
those
instances
were
deliberately
blurred
to
hide
what
u.s.
satellites
could
really
do
there's
a
good
reason
for
that
these
satellites
are
in
the
billion-to-multibillion-dollar
range
they
are
worth
more
than
their
weight
in
gold
he
says
the
photos
they
produce
are
so
good
they're
at
the
limits
of
the
laws
of
physics
it's
the
best
picture
you
can
possibly
take
from
space
aftergood
thinks
the
president's
decision
to
tweet
what
looks
like
an
unblurred
photo
of
the
iranian
accident
was
a
bad
idea
in
chess
terms
he
has
sacrificed
a
bishop
for
a
pawn
or
less
he
says
what
the
president
did
is
pretty
sporty
says
rebeccah
heinrichs
with
the
conservative
hudson
institute
but
she
also
thinks
it
was
done
deliberately
the
text
of
the
tweet
was
clearly
written
by
or
vetted
by
someone
with
an
intelligence
background
heinrichs
says
noting
the
use
of
abbreviations
such
as
slv
for
space
launch
vehicle
and
she
thinks
the
tweet
sends
a
powerful
message
to
iran
he
is
communicating
that
we
are
carefully
watching
and
that
we
are
using
restraint
and
that
if
we
wanted
to
do
more
we
could
she
says
at
least
some
experts
agree
nations
are
not
suddenly
going
to
say
oh
no
we
had
no
idea
they
could
watch
us
this
closely
says
one
senior
satellite
imaging
expert
who
asked
to
remain
anonymous
because
of
the
furor
around
trump's
tweet
yes
there
is
clearly
more
detail
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
useful
information
beyond
what
the
best
commercial
imagery
provides
but
aftergood
thinks
iran
will
be
able
to
learn
from
the
image
a
group
of
independent
satellite
spotters
says
it
has
already
determined
which
u.s.
satellite
took
the
picture
usa
one
of
america's
most
advanced
spy
satellites
passed
over
the
launch
site
shortly
after
the
accident
now
that
the
satellite
has
been
pinpointed
aftergood
worries
that
iran
can
evade
it
for
example
he
says
in
the
runup
to
an
indian
nuclear
weapons
test
in
india
tracked
u.s.
satellites
and
made
sure
not
to
move
any
major
equipment
while
they
were
overhead
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
was
caught
off
guard
by
the
test
when
it
happened
and
klingner
the
former
cia
officer
notes
that
iran
wasn't
the
only
one
that
saw
the
tweet
our
adversaries
russia
china
north
korea
iran
syria
and
others
will
be
looking
at
this
trying
to
figure
out
how
good
our
capabilities
are
klingner
says
he
worries
they
just
might
learn
something
