young
democrats
there's
clear
evidence
that
the
face
of
texas
is
changing
about
young
adults
almost
all
minorities
are
crammed
into
a
side
room
of
a
bubble
tea
cafe
in
the
houston
suburbs
on
a
steamy
august
evening
as
local
and
congressional
candidates
make
their
pitch
to
the
new
group
there
are
roaring
cheers
and
a
sense
of
optimism
that
wasn't
here
even
a
decade
ago
ali
hasanali
a
year-old
assistant
district
attorney
has
been
involved
in
local
politics
in
his
hometown
since
and
he
remembers
a
much
lonelier
scenario
back
then
my
first
democratic
party
meeting
there
was
maybe
of
us
i
was
probably
the
youngest
person
there
by
three
decades
i
was
definitely
the
only
asian-american
in
the
room
hasanali
said
we
didn't
have
enough
people
to
run
for
office
let
alone
participate
in
getting
people
out
to
vote
but
aided
by
both
rapid
demographic
shifts
and
a
backlash
to
president
trump
that's
permeating
many
suburban
areas
this
area
is
quickly
changing
and
becoming
ripe
for
democrats
in
democrats
flipped
two
congressional
seats
in
texas
now
they're
eyeing
at
least
six
more
gop-held
districts
that
may
be
vulnerable
including
the
nd
district
which
is
anchored
in
fort
bend
county
along
with
parts
of
harris
and
brazoria
counties
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
has
already
opened
an
office
in
texas
with
field
staff
to
help
them
toward
that
task
republican
worries
are
mounting
here
too
and
have
grown
just
over
the
past
month
after
four
gop
incumbents
announced
they
won't
run
again
in
democrats
see
backlash
to
trump
as
a
silver
lining
rice
university
political
science
professor
mark
jones
says
this
area
in
the
southwest
houston
suburbs
and
exurbs
has
seen
major
growth
particularly
among
its
hispanic
and
asian
populations
and
is
on
pace
to
become
even
more
diverse
given
that
most
younger
residents
who
have
yet
to
turn
are
minorities
but
over
the
past
few
years
even
voting-age
minorities
who
may
not
have
been
engaged
are
being
spurred
to
register
and
vote
in
fort
bend
county
we've
seen
trump's
unique
ability
to
alienate
asian-american
who
in
the
past
had
voted
republican
and
latinos
who
voted
at
much
lower
rates
than
anglos
said
jones
republican
strategist
brian
walsh
a
former
aide
to
texas
sen
john
cornyn
says
his
party
needs
to
be
worried
about
diversifying
areas
like
the
nd
district
and
that
trump
is
hurting
any
efforts
to
reach
out
to
these
changing
suburban
districts
texas
exemplifies
sort
of
a
larger
problem
and
conversation
the
republican
party
needs
to
have
within
itself
not
just
looking
ahead
to
but
beyond
as
well
walsh
said
so
republicans
if
they
want
to
continue
to
hold
texas
will
need
to
look
back
and
having
a
big
tent
philosophy
which
is
not
currently
happening
at
the
moment
fort
bend
county
judge
k.p.
george
is
a
prime
example
of
the
area's
new
diversity
and
political
change

george
grew
up
in
poverty
in
a
remote
indian
village
before
coming
to
the
u.s.
in
last
year
he
became
the
first
democrat
to
win
the
top
countywide
position
in
nearly
years
and
he's
the
first
minority
ever
to
hold
the
office
the
county
commission
also
flipped
from
gop
to
democratic
control
president
trump
coming
into
office
it
influenced
a
lot
of
people
because
they
all
of
a
sudden
realize
being
an
immigrant
their
existence
is
being
challenged
and
being
an
immigrant
your
existence
is
the
most
important
thing
george
said
a
lot
of
people
came
out
and
voted
and
i'm
hoping
we
are
going
to
continue
that
strength
in
when
cynthia
ginyard
took
over
the
fort
bend
county
democratic
party
in
spring
of
she
knew
the
party
had
to
reach
out
beyond
its
traditional
base
of
african-americans
like
herself
and
some
more
liberal
whites
we
are
every
color
race
creed
religion
we
make
up
the
democratic
party
but
all
of
them
were
not
always
a
part
of
or
were
welcomed
or
felt
welcome
to
come
and
join
she
said
from
the
party's
new
permanent
headquarters
cynthia
ginyard

george
ginyard
says
trump
has
been
a
blessing
in
disguise
because
he's
prodded
people
who
may
not
vote
to
now
become
active
they
always
say
that
there
is
a
silver
lining
behind
every
cloud
well
trump
is
the
silver
lining
in
this
black
cloud
he's
brought
to
our
country
because
he
has
energized
this
side
of
the
party
ginyard
said
the
battleground
but
there's
still
more
work
to
do
local
democrats
are
quick
to
point
out
their
next
big
target
is
the
nd
congressional
district
it
went
for
mitt
romney
by
points
in
but
in
trump
only
carried
it
by
points
and
last
month
republican
rep
pete
olson
announced
he
was
retiring
during
his
campaign
against
olson
former
foreign
service
officer
sri
preston
kulkarni
tried
to
tap
into
those
changing
demographics
especially
the
nd's
foreign
born
population
a
quarter
of
the
district
a
key
part
of
his
strategy
last
year
was
reaching
out
to
immigrants
often
in
their
native
languages
after
realizing
that
almost
three-quarters
of
those
voters
had
never
been
contacted
by
a
democrat
or
a
republican
kulkarni
came
within
five
points
of
beating
the
gop
incumbent
i
studied
linguistics
in
college
i
speak
six
language
myself
they
said
don't
bother
with
those
voters
because
they
don't
vote
i
said
maybe
they
don't
vote
because
we
don't
bother
and
so
we
tried
it
and
we
brought
out
more
people
than
anybody
had
ever
imagined
kulkarni
said
according
to
numbers
from
rice's
jones
the
changing
demographic
shifts
are
significant
in
of
the
district's
voting
age
population
was
anglo
by
it's
dropped
to
with
about
latino
asian-american
and
african-american
and
jones
expects
the
upcoming
census
next
year
to
give
an
even
clearer
reflection
of
the
monumental
shifts
kulkarni
himself
personifies
the
changes
at
play
in
this
part
of
texas
his
father
was
an
indian
immigrant
his
mother
is
actually
a
descendant
of
sam
houston
the
first
president
of
the
republic
of
texas
if
elected
in
kulkarni
would
not
only
be
the
first
asian-american
to
represent
texas
he'd
be
the
first
hindu
too
this
stereotype
that
texans
only
look
one
way
they
only
have
one
religion
they
only
talk
one
way
that's
from
or
years
ago
look
around
you
look
around
at
fort
bend
look
around
at
houston
look
around
at
this
state
