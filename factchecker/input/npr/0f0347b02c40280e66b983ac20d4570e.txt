cokie
roberts
died
on
tuesday
of
complications
from
breast
cancer
our
newsroom
is
in
tears
my
phone
and
email
are
bursting
with
more
tears
the
country
has
lost
a
great
journalist
but
i
and
so
many
thousands
of
others
have
lost
a
great
friend
yes
thousands
of
others
cokie
roberts
was
the
embodiment
of
our
better
angels
whether
it
was
her
work
for
save
the
children
or
the
millions
of
kindnesses
large
and
small
that
she
dispensed
daily
without
ever
thinking
that
what
she
was
doing
was
unusual
or
remarkable
the
country
knew
her
as
this
always
polite
political
reporter
willing
to
ask
the
impolitic
question
if
necessary
this
funny
wise
smart
woman
who
could
write
circles
around
most
reporters
for
the
past
three
years
as
she
battled
the
return
of
a
cancer
vanquished
some
years
earlier
she
carried
on
always
with
that
infectious
laugh
she
gave
speeches
appeared
on
tv
and
radio
and
even
called
me
a
few
days
ago
from
the
hospital
to
get
a
fill
on
my
reporting
about
the
new
npr
president
indeed
she
was
planning
to
go
to
houston
for
the
debates
last
week
until
her
disease
finally
trumped
her
grit
she
didn't
want
people
to
know
she
was
sick
she
loved
life
and
she
was
determined
to
live
it
as
long
as
she
could
and
that
meant
doing
what
she
always
did
including
being
a
super
wife
mother
and
grandmother
there
was
not
a
chance
she
was
going
to
cancel
commitments
no
matter
how
rotten
she
felt
there
was
not
a
chance
she
would
just
lie
in
bed
just
days
ago
she
insisted
on
going
to
the
movies
as
usual
on
saturday
night
with
me
linda
wertheimer
and
our
husbands
by
then
she
could
barely
eat
and
was
in
significant
pain
but
we
all
had
a
lovely
time

in
our
last
time
like
that
to
know
cokie
was
to
see
the
personification
of
human
decency
there
is
a
reason
she
was
asked
to
speak
at
so
many
funerals
people
felt
such
a
deep
connection
to
her
because
she
touched
their
lives
casual
friends
would
find
cokie
visiting
them
in
the
hospital
people
in
terrible
financial
straits
would
find
her
bailing
them
out
hiring
them
for
work
that
perhaps
she
did
not
need
but
work
that
left
them
with
their
dignity
and
i
well
i
am
not
sure
how
i
would
have
survived
the
long
illness
and
death
of
my
first
husband
without
cokie
she
went
with
me
to
doctors
meetings
took
notes
gave
people
hell
if
promised
services
were
not
delivered
and
if
on
occasion
she
heard
my
voice
faltering
on
the
phone
she
would
magically
appear
to
bolster
my
spirits

on
a
larger
scale
she
was
always
the
voice
of
people
with
less
power
and
the
voice
of
what
is
right
i
remember
one
day
many
years
ago
when
we
were
in
negotiations
with
npr
management
over
a
labor
contract
management
didn't
want
to
extend
health
care
coverage
to
one
group
and
we
were
at
an
impasse
then
cokie
who
was
working
on
a
piece
of
embroidery
looked
up
at
the
management
team
and
said
you
know
the
position
you
are
taking
isn't
immoral
it
is
simply
amoral
the
room
got
very
quiet
and
soon
the
impasse
was
over

and

and
of
course
she
was
the
voice
of
women
she
understood
injustices
large
and
small
she
understood
the
hurdles
that
blue-
pink-
and
white-collar
women
face
in
raising
and
providing
for
a
family
in
dealing
with
husbands
and
bosses
she
understood
the
whole
balance
of
life
i
went
to
see
her
monday
night
in
the
hospital
i
am
not
sure
that
she
could
hear
me
but
when
i
said
goodbye
i
told
her
i'd
see
her
on
the
other
side
at
that
big
broadcasting
studio
somewhere
and
that
i
knew
she
would
still
be
a
star
