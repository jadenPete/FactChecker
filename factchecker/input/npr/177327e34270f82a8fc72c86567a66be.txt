a
federal
judge
is
allowing
a
new
york-led
coalition
of
states
and
other
groups
to
defend
the
census
bureau
in
a
lawsuit
brought
by
alabama
the
new
york
state
attorney
general's
office
said
friday
alabama
is
challenging
more
than
years
of
precedent
in
how
the
federal
government
divides
up
congressional
seats
using
population
counts
that
include
unauthorized
immigrants
the
decision
by
u.s.
district
judge
r.
david
proctor
of
birmingham
ala
who
released
a
formal
court
ruling
on
sept
raises
the
profile
of
this
census
lawsuit
which
was
once
overshadowed
by
the
more-than-yearlong
legal
battle
over
the
trump
administration's
failed
attempt
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
census
forms
attorneys
for
the
coalition
headed
by
the
new
york
state
attorney
general's
office
say
they
were
prompted
in
part
to
intervene
by
comments
in
july
from
u.s.
attorney
general
william
barr
that
raised
questions
about
whether
the
trump
administration
would
fully
defend
the
bureau
in
the
lawsuit
we
are
intervening
in
this
case
because
the
federal
government
is
failing
its
obligation
to
represent
the
american
people
and
this
lawsuit
deserves
a
robust
defense
new
york
state
attorney
general
letitia
james
said
friday
in
a
written
statement
we
will
continue
to
fight
to
ensure
that
every
person
residing
in
this
country
is
counted
just
as
the
framers
intended
since
the
first
national
head
count
in
the
federal
government
has
always
included
both
u.s.
citizens
and
noncitizens
without
regard
to
immigration
status
in
the
once-a-decade
population
counts
of
persons
living
in
the
u.s.
as
required
by
the
constitution
the
number
of
congressional
seats
and
electoral
college
votes
each
state
receives
is
determined
by
those
numbers
but
the
state
of
alabama
along
with
u.s.
rep
mo
brooks
a
republican
from
the
state
filed
the
lawsuit
last
year
arguing
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
for
unauthorized
immigrants
to
be
counted
as
persons
for
apportionment
in
july
barr
took
part
in
the
trump
administration's
announcement
that
it
would
rely
on
existing
government
records
to
produce
detailed
citizenship
data
rather
than
adding
a
citizenship
question
to
census
forms
referring
to
alabama's
lawsuit
the
attorney
general
said
those
data
could
be
relevant
to
a
current
dispute
over
whether
illegal
aliens
can
be
included
for
apportionment
purposes
we
will
be
studying
this
issue
barr
added
on
friday
the
census
bureau's
chief
scientist
john
abowd
confirmed
that
the
agency
is
planning
to
release
apportionment
counts
next
year
that
include
citizens
unauthorized
immigrants
and
other
noncitizens
the
census
bureau
has
not
changed
the
method
by
which
apportionment
calculations
will
be
calculated
from
census
data
and
its
processing
abowd
said
during
a
meeting
of
the
council
of
professional
associations
on
federal
statistics
in
washington
d.c.
abowd's
statements
came
after
more
than
three
weeks
of
silence
from
the
bureau
on
its
plans
for
the
apportionment
count
while
the
agency's
website
says
that
congressional
apportionment
is
based
upon
the
total
resident
population
citizens
and
non-citizens
of
the
states
the
bureau
had
not
directly
responded
to
npr's
question
last
month
about
whether
unauthorized
immigrants
would
be
included
proctor
is
also
permitting
the
city
of
atlanta
and
virginia's
arlington
county
to
join
the
lawsuit
in
defense
of
the
bureau
attorney
dorian
spence
of
the
lawyers
committee
for
civil
rights
under
law
one
of
the
legal
organizations
representing
the
local
governments
tells
npr
outside
of
the
lawyers
committee
other
groups
that
have
also
said
they
don't
trust
the
administration
to
properly
defend
the
bureau
have
already
stepped
in
to
intervene
in
the
case
including
groups
represented
by
the
mexican
american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
attorneys
for
the
coalition
of
states
say
they
are
uniquely
positioned
to
defend
the
bureau's
policy
because
the
states
are
at
risk
of
losing
congressional
seats
and
as
a
potential
result
of
reduced
voting
power
on
capitol
hill
their
fair
share
of
federal
funding
