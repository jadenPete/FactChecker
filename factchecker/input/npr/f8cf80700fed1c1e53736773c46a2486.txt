senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
and
other
senators
received
a
message
from
business
leaders
thursday
urging
them
to
take
action
on
gun
violence
in
the
u.s.
the
ceos
of
companies
issued
a
new
call
for
gun
safety
thursday
sending
a
letter
to
members
of
the
senate
on
thursday
stating
that
it
is
simply
unacceptable
to
do
nothing
about
gun
violence
and
mass
shootings
in
the
u.s.
saying
the
country
is
in
a
public
health
crisis
the
ceos
say
new
laws
that
would
require
background
checks
on
all
gun
sales
are
a
common-sense
solution
with
overwhelming
public
support
and
are
a
critical
step
toward
stemming
the
gun
violence
epidemic
in
this
country
to
save
lives
the
letter
states
the
senate
must
follow
the
house's
lead
by
passing
bipartisan
legislation
that
would
update
the
background
checks
law
the
ceos
come
from
a
variety
of
companies
including
amalgamated
bank
and
the
royal
caribbean
cruise
line
the
heads
of
airbnb
yelp
and
dick's
sporting
goods
also
signed
the
letter
along
with
stronger
background
checks
the
business
leaders
are
calling
for
a
strong
red
flag
law
which
could
prevent
shootings
in
cases
where
family
members
or
law
enforcement
report
concerns
about
someone
who
may
be
at
risk
of
harming
themselves
or
others
the
letter
doesn't
mention
the
financial
losses
from
violence
citing
recent
tragedies
in
dayton
ohio
el
paso
texas
gilroy
calif
and
elsewhere
the
ceos
say
that
millions
of
americans
have
had
their
lives
changed
by
gun
violence
and
that
it's
time
for
lawmakers
to
respond
every
day
americans
are
shot
and
killed
and
hundreds
more
are
wounded
the
letter
states
several
senators
offices
confirmed
to
npr
that
they've
received
the
letter
and
the
topic
came
up
when
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
talked
with
reporters
thursday
morning
what
i've
said
consistently
is
let's
see
if
we
can
actually
make
a
law
here
mcconnell
said
and
making
a
law
when
you
have
divided
government
is
challenging
we
all
have
different
points
of
view
mcconnell
added
that
a
new
law
would
need
president
trump's
approval
the
senate
leader's
remarks
came
two
days
after
he
said
the
white
house
is
working
on
a
proposal
to
respond
to
recent
deadly
shootings
he
did
not
provide
details
earlier
this
year
the
house
approved
two
pieces
of
gun
legislation
that
would
require
background
checks
for
all
firearm
sales
under
the
current
laws
a
federally
licensed
dealer
must
conduct
a
background
check
but
private
sellers
people
who
are
not
licensed
dealers
can
sell
guns
without
conducting
a
background
check
as
ucla
law
professor
adam
winkler
told
npr
last
month
this
law
would
close
that
loophole
the
main
difference
between
the
two
house
bills
is
the
amount
of
time
they
allow
for
a
waiting
period
after
a
gun
purchaser
can
acquire
a
firearm
one
version
calls
for
three
days
and
the
other
for
days
the
letter
is
the
american
business
community's
latest
attempt
to
push
back
on
guns
after
people
died
in
mass
killings
in
the
u.s.
during
the
month
of
august
last
week
the
ceo
of
walmart
which
suffered
a
shooting
at
an
el
paso
store
that
left
people
dead
called
on
washington
to
strengthen
background
checks
and
make
sure
people
who
are
found
to
pose
a
danger
can't
access
firearms
a
growing
number
of
stores
from
walmart
to
cvs
publix
kroger
and
others
are
also
asking
shoppers
to
refrain
from
openly
carrying
guns
in
their
stores
whether
local
or
states
laws
allow
it
or
not
in
the
wake
of
the
recent
shootings
president
trump
repeatedly
urged
republicans
and
democrats
to
work
together
on
background
checks
saying
on
twitter
we
cannot
let
those
killed
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
die
in
vain
days
after
issuing
that
message
trump
said
serious
discussions
are
taking
place
between
house
and
senate
leadership
on
meaningful
background
checks
but
the
president's
stance
on
gun
issues
has
also
wavered
for
instance
he
has
recently
insisted
u.s.
background
checks
are
already
strong
and
in
early
august
trump
said
he's
in
favor
of
red
flag
laws
but
that
push
seems
limited
to
having
congress
back
states
attempts
to
enact
their
own
laws
rather
than
codifying
the
approach
in
federal
law
those
statements
came
more
than
a
year
after
trump
made
pledges
about
tighter
gun
control
after
saying
he
supported
comprehensive
background
checks
trump
said
in
march
very
strong
improvement
and
strengthening
of
background
checks
will
be
fully
backed
by
white
house
the
president
added
legislation
moving
forward
while
there
has
been
little
forward
progress
for
background
checks
the
trump
administration
has
followed
through
on
one
of
the
president's
other
initiatives
to
curb
gun
violence
as
the
justice
department
said
last
december
that
it
was
banning
the
type
of
bump
stock
devices
used
in
the
las
vegas
shooting
despite
legal
challenges
that
ban
remains
in
effect

walmart
is
among
npr's
recent
sponsors
