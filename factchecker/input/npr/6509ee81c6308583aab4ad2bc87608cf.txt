president
trump
speaks
to
about
contractors
at
the
shell
chemicals
petrochemical
complex
on
tuesday
in
monaca
pa
following
two
recent
mass
shootings
about
half
a
dozen
democratic
presidential
candidates
are
not
mincing
their
words
when
it
comes
to
president
trump
they're
calling
him
a
white
supremacist
he
is
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
said
on
msnbc
he
had
already
called
trump
a
racist
and
was
asked
whether
he
thought
trump
was
a
white
supremacist
he
is
a
dehumanizer
he
has
been
very
clear
about
who
he
prefers
to
be
in
this
country
and
who
he
literally
wants
to
keep
out
with
walls
and
cages
and
militarization
and
torture
and
cruelty
and
again
we
in
el
paso
have
born
the
brunt
of
all
of
that
twenty-two
people
were
killed
in
el
paso
texas
earlier
this
month
when
a
gunman
opened
fire
in
a
walmart
people
from
both
sides
of
the
u.s.
mexico
border
were
killed
and
the
shooter
is
believed
to
have
written
a
screed
deriding
immigrants
as
invaders
the
language
in
that
manifesto
is
similar
to
the
kind
of
language
trump
has
used
leading
many
to
blame
the
president
for
using
irresponsible
rhetoric
that
could
inspire
people
at
the
fringes
the
progressive
left
has
pressed
candidates
and
the
media
to
call
trump
a
liar
and
a
racist
in
fact
in
a
recent
quinnipiac
poll
more
than
half
of
americans
said
they
believe
the
president
is
a
racist
and
the
country
has
been
bitterly
divided
through
partisan
lenses
on
race
in
this
country
but
calling
the
president
an
actual
white
supremacist
is
an
escalation
that
has
driven
a
wedge
between
some
of
the
candidates
vice
president
joe
biden
has
said
trump
has
fanned
the
flames
of
white
supremacy
and
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
said
trump
empowers
white
supremacists
and
condones
their
behavior
for
others
though
that
doesn't
go
far
enough
count
o'rourke
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
indiana
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
of
new
york
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
among
those
who
have
said
the
president
is
in
fact
a
white
supremacist
not
everyone
even
some
of
those
tasked
with
tracking
hate
groups
thinks
that's
responsible
i
think
it
misses
the
point
and
overlooks
the
role
that
the
president
should
be
playing
said
oren
segal
director
of
anti-defamation
league's
center
on
extremism
but
that
doesn't
mean
segal
thinks
the
president
has
been
responsible
with
his
rhetoric
segal
points
out
that
using
terms
like
invasion
when
talking
about
immigrants
and
peddling
conspiracies
about
caravans
are
all
in
line
with
foundational
ideologies
of
white
supremacists
that's
problematic
and
gives
a
degree
of
comfort
to
those
groups
he
said
calling
him
a
white
supremacist
based
on
those
segal
added
misses
a
larger
point
of
what
white
supremacy
is
they're
calling
for
a
white
ethno
state
and
are
clear
about
their
opposition
to
minorities
in
some
cases
many
don't
like
trump
some
are
disappointed
for
example
that
he
has
a
jewish
son-in-law
and
hasn't
gone
as
far
as
they
would
have
liked
he
added
it's
understandable
to
call
out
public
officials
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
whose
language
seeks
to
mainstream
the
narratives
that
feed
white
supremacist
ideas
it's
completely
acceptable
to
call
out
any
public
official
when
they
are
echoing
those
statements
and
ask
them
to
tone
it
down
but
going
straight
for
this
person
as
a
white
supremacist
is
a
little
too
simple
and
in
fact
distracts
from
the
calls
for
many
of
those
public
officials
to
use
their
positions
to
call
out
hatred
and
white
supremacy
by
name
you
know
you
can't
call
someone
a
white
supremacist
and
ask
them
to
condemn
it
others
disagree
most
notably
the
writer
ta-nehisi
coates
coates
penned
a
piece
in
the
atlantic
just
months
after
trump
was
inaugurated
titled
the
first
white
president
he
defended
his
stance
on
television
i
think
if
you
own
a
business
that
attempts
to
keep
black
people
from
renting
from
you
coates
said
if
your
response
to
the
first
black
president
is
that
they
weren't
born
in
this
country
despite
all
proof
if
you
say
they
weren't
smart
enough
to
go
to
harvard
law
school
and
then
demand
to
see
their
grades
if
that's
the
essence
of
your
entire
political
identity
you
might
be
a
white
supremacist
akiba
solomon
co-author
with
kenrya
rankin
of
how
we
fight
white
supremacy
a
field
guide
to
black
resistance
notes
the
president
traffics
in
white-supremacist
rhetoric
and
pushes
polices
that
are
white
supremacist
in
impact
i
don't
know
his
heart
or
soul
i've
never
met
him
but
there
is
a
pattern
of
white-supremacist
decision
making
throughout
his
entire
career
she
adds
that
in
her
book
white
supremacy
is
defined
as
a
political
cultural
and
economic
system
premised
on
the
subjugation
of
people
who
are
not
white
so
she
said
according
to
that
description
i
would
call
the
president
a
white
supremacist
trump
defends
himself
and
denounces
white
supremacy
trump
condemned
white
supremacy
in
a
speech
from
the
white
house
last
week
after
the
el
paso
shooting
the
shooter
in
el
paso
posted
a
manifesto
online
consumed
by
racist
hate
trump
said
in
one
voice
our
nation
must
condemn
racism
bigotry
and
white
supremacy
these
sinister
ideologies
must
be
defeated
hate
has
no
place
in
america
the
trump
reelection
campaign
tweeted
examples
of
the
president
denouncing
hate
and
racism
including
white
supremacy
the
campaign
declined
to
say
whether
it
thought
democrats
labeling
the
president
a
white
supremacist
was
helping
the
president's
campaign
for
two
years
democrats
called
the
president
a
russian
agent
trump
campaign
communications
director
tim
murtaugh
said
in
a
statement
since
that
failed
they've
moved
on
to
calling
him
a
racist
white
supremacist
mass
murderer
it's
false
and
absurd
on
its
face
and
americans
will
see
that
democrats
are
trying
to
divide
americans
they're
also
claiming
that
anyone
who
supports
president
trump
is
racist
calling
half
of
the
country
racist
is
not
a
winning
strategy
and
is
not
unifying
trump
himself
told
reporters
he
didn't
think
it
helps
him
i
don't
think
it
helps
he
said
first
of
all
i
don't
like
when
they
do
it
because
i
am
not
any
of
those
things
i
think
it's
a
disgrace
and
i
think
it
shows
how
desperate
the
democrats
are
words
that
ring
hollow
heidi
beirich
director
of
the
intelligence
project
at
the
southern
poverty
law
center
said
trump's
words
denouncing
white
supremacy
at
best
ring
hollow
i
felt
like
they
were
the
right
words
and
definitely
the
wrong
messenger
she
said
because
he's
pushed
out
one
white
supremacist
meme
or
talking
point
after
another
since
he
came
down
the
escalator
for
his
campaign
kickoff
announcement
in
she
notes
that
the
debate
over
the
language
democratic
presidential
candidates
are
using
misses
a
larger
point
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
trump
seems
to
be
using
these
nasty
tactics
as
a
way
to
rally
the
base
beirich
said
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
matter
what's
in
his
heart
his
mainstreaming
them
white
supremacists
and
legitimizing
them
that's
the
problem
and
this
stuff
is
blossoming
it's
a
dangerous
game
that
trump
is
playing
to
beirich's
point
about
white
supremacy's
rise
the
anti-defamation
league
has
found
that
in
just
the
first
five
months
of
there
has
been
an
increase
in
white
supremacist
recruitment
segal
said
he
noted
that
white
supremacists
are
pushing
propaganda
in
public
spaces
which
speaks
to
a
comfort
level
they
have
he
said
and
hate-related
murders
connected
to
right-wing
extremists
segal
said
are
a
consistent
threat
and
have
risen
over
the
last
decade
many
of
the
statements
trump
has
made
are
exactly
what
a
white
supremacist
would
say
whether
talking
about
immigrants
invading
or
african
countries
being
s
holes
or
mexicans
are
rapists
beirich
noted
he's
tweeted
out
material
that
came
from
white
supremacists
and
a
lot
of
his
views
are
indirectly
views
from
white
nationalists
i
don't
know
if
that
makes
him
a
white
nationalist
but
he's
talking
from
their
scripts
and
beirich
added
there
is
a
link
between
this
kind
of
rhetoric
and
violence
segal
agrees
but
notes
overall
we
need
to
understand
the
impact
of
these
narratives
on
the
white
supremacy
movement
but
without
having
to
ascribe
white
supremacist
intent
on
the
president
