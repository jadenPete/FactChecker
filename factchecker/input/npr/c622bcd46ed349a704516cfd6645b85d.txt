much
of
the
fleet
of
electronic
voting
machines
in
the
united
states
was
designed
without
security
in
mind
in
response
to
the
last
big
national
flap
over
an
election
in
voting
systems
in
the
united
states
have
come
a
long
way
since
the
hanging
chads
of
the
recount
in
florida
but
now
cybersecurity
is
as
big
a
concern
as
ballot
fidelity
here's
what
you
need
to
know
the
good
news
there
are
about
counties
or
their
equivalents
across
the
united
states
and
its
territories
ranging
in
size
from
los
angeles
county
with
around
million
residents
to
kalawao
county
hawaii
with
fewer
than
most
counties
more
than
have
populations
under
about
says
the
national
association
of
counties
that
huge
breadth
and
diversity
means
that
most
elections
truly
are
local
and
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
for
a
foreign
adversary
to
touch
them
all
with
a
single
effort
elections
in
the
united
states
remain
as
then-fbi
director
james
comey
famously
told
congress
a
bit
of
a
hairball
the
bad
news
a
huge
breadth
and
diversity
of
counties
means
a
huge
breadth
and
diversity
of
security
capabilities
also
every
jurisdiction
that
runs
elections
in
the
united
states
doesn't
present
the
same
kind
of
appeal
to
a
foreign
interference
campaign
the
results
of
a
close
election
can
depend
on
turnout
in
only
a
few
key
states
or
other
locations
meaning
some
locations
are
under
much
more
pressure
than
others
at
the
same
time
evidence
about
successful
interference
in
an
election
system
anywhere
in
the
united
states
would
raise
questions
about
the
integrity
of
elections
everywhere
russian
cyberattackers
have
been
able
to
gain
access
to
voter
databases
and
other
systems
around
country
but
u.s.
officials
say
they
believe
no
votes
have
been
changed
risk
of
compromised
votes
a
worst-case
fear
is
that
a
cyber-compromise
could
allow
a
foreign
adversary
to
change
americans
votes
and
throw
results
in
key
places
twelve
states
include
jurisdictions
that
use
paperless
voting
machines
according
to
a
report
by
the
brennan
center
although
efforts
are
underway
across
the
country
to
upgrade
machines
by
election
day
some
experts
fear
that
without
a
paper
record
for
a
person's
ballot
there's
no
way
to
audit
an
election
after
the
fact
and
verify
the
total
but
there
are
other
worries
about
cybervulnerabilities
including
the
systems
used
to
check
voters
in
on
election
day
called
e-pollbooks
and
databases
of
voter
data
used
by
officials
or
vendors
that
the
public
doesn't
see
russian
cyberattackers
accessed
those
kinds
of
databases
in
some
places
in
their
attack
on
the
election
according
to
the
findings
of
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
risk
of
spreading
false
information
foreign
election
interference
in
recent
years
has
mostly
been
about
influencing
the
information
environment
within
the
united
states
that
could
be
a
way
in
which
voters
behavior
is
affected
without
a
compromise
to
elections
systems
imagine
a
highly
convincing
fake
video
that
went
viral
on
social
networks
just
hours
before
a
key
milestone
in
an
election
there
are
other
older
types
of
mischief
that
could
influence
people
emails
circulating
ahead
of
election
day
that
offered
people
a
link
to
vote
online
tricking
someone
into
thinking
they'd
cast
a
ballot
and
staying
home
on
the
real
election
day
or
a
text
message
that
said
republicans
vote
on
tuesday
democrats
day
to
vote
is
wednesday
this
chicanery
often
takes
place
in
elections
but
it's
getting
new
attention
following
the
russian
interference
in
vulnerable
voting
machines
voting
machines
are
like
any
other
computer
the
older
they
get
the
less
current
they
remain
much
of
the
fleet
of
electronic
voting
machines
in
the
united
states
was
designed
without
security
in
mind
in
response
to
the
last
big
national
flap
over
an
election
in
the
last
big
national
focus
on
voting
machines
was
about
making
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
voters
to
understand
and
record
their
intentions
and
ease-of-use
remains
a
major
priority
the
tension
between
accessibility
and
security
could
remain
a
big
theme
ahead
of
the
big
vote
in
high
cost
of
replacing
voting
machines
the
brennan
center
estimates
that
it
might
cost
somewhere
between
million
and
billion
to
replace
all
the
voting
machines
in
the
united
states
although
there
are
no
official
estimates
from
the
government
there
also
isn't
legislation
that
would
authorize
the
spending
of
that
kind
of
money
and
there
probably
isn't
time
even
if
congress
supported
doing
so
to
recapitalize
all
voting
equipment
before
election
day
about
million
americans
will
use
paperless
voting
machines
in
the
election
congress
may
not
act
before
election
day
congress
has
authorized
about
million
to
upgrade
voting
machines
around
the
united
states
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
agencies
say
they're
working
to
help
safeguard
against
foreign
interference
and
strengthen
cybersecurity
lawmakers
also
have
discussed
mandating
a
paper
ballot
backup
for
every
vote
increasing
restrictions
and
disclosure
for
social
media
platforms
and
requiring
u.s.
campaigns
to
report
to
the
fbi
when
they
make
contact
with
foreign
government
agents
there's
no
consensus
about
the
details
however
and
it
isn't
clear
whether
any
bill
could
take
effect
before
election
day
