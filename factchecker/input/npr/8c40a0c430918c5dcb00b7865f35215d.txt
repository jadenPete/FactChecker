republican
dan
bishop
eked
out
a
victory
in
a
closely
watched
north
carolina
special
congressional
election
on
tuesday
night
a
scandal-plagued
race
that
was
actually
the
final
uncalled
contest
of
the
midterms
bishop
a
state
senator
narrowly
defeated
democrat
dan
mccready
by
fewer
than
votes
to
this
suburban
charlotte
district
had
voted
for
trump
by
points
in
and
has
been
held
by
republicans
for
more
than
years
the
president
held
an
election
eve
rally
to
help
save
the
seat
that
appeared
to
have
the
intended
boost
especially
when
looking
at
the
election
day
turnout
president
trump
partially
credited
himself
for
bishop's
victory
in
a
tweet
tuesday
night
no
public
or
private
polling
ever
showed
bishop
down
by
that
much
and
both
parties
acknowledged
throughout
the
race
that
it
was
a
neck-and-neck
contest
trump
later
called
the
race
a
big
night
for
the
republican
party
the
close
margin
of
victory
should
be
incredibly
worrisome
for
republicans
showing
that
democratic
enthusiasm
especially
in
the
suburbs
hasn't
dissipated
much
since
the
november
elections
when
the
house
flipped
control
but
mccready
actually
ended
up
losing
ground
in
some
rural
areas
compared
to
his
margins
it's
further
evidence
that
democrats
haven't
yet
found
a
way
to
make
gains
outside
of
their
strongholds
and
further
highlighting
the
growing
urban
suburban
vs
rural
divide
in
the
country
this
was
actually
the
final
election
of
the
midterms
thanks
to
months-long
drama
due
to
allegations
of
ballot
tampering
by
an
aide
to
then-gop
nominee
mark
harris
the
final
total
showed
harris
with
a
slim
vote
lead
over
mccready
but
the
state
board
of
elections
threw
out
that
result
and
ordered
a
new
election
harris
bowed
out
and
republicans
picked
a
new
less-tainted
nominee
in
bishop
mccready
a
marine
corps
veteran
who
pitched
himself
as
a
centrist
who
was
focused
on
health
care
and
pocketbook
issues
had
a
head
start
in
the
race
and
heavily
outraised
bishop
that's
why
republican
outside
groups
poured
more
than
million
in
outside
spending
to
level
the
playing
field
and
salvage
a
win
bishop
ran
a
campaign
where
he
closely
tied
himself
to
trump
and
promised
to
be
a
faithful
ally
of
the
president
in
congress
he
tied
bishop
to
progressive
democrats
such
as
new
york
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
minnesota
rep
ilhan
omar
in
ads
utilizing
trump's
rhetoric
to
brand
them
and
mccready
as
socialists
national
republican
congressional
committee
chairman
tom
emmer
said
that
bishop's
victory
showed
that
their
messaging
so
far
in
the
cycle
was
working
north
carolinians
rejected
the
democrats
socialist
agenda
and
elected
a
representative
who
will
defend
north
carolina
values
and
will
always
fight
for
freedom
and
against
socialism
emmer
said
in
a
statement
but
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
chairwoman
cheri
bustos
pointed
out
that
this
was
already
a
far
more
conservative
seat
than
most
of
the
ones
democrats
flipped
in
there
are
republican-held
districts
that
are
more
favorable
to
democrats
than
north
carolina's
ninth
tonight's
razor-thin
result
in
this
ruby-red
district
solidifies
the
fact
that
democrats
are
pushing
further
into
republican
strongholds
and
are
in
a
commanding
position
to
protect
and
expand
our
house
majority
in
