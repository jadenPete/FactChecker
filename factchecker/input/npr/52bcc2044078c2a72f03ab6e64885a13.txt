democratic

candidates
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
say
corporate
america
has
put
profits
before
workers
by
shifting
jobs
to
other
countries
democrats
running
for
president
next
year
have
worked
hard
to
differentiate
themselves
from
president
trump
on
issues
such
as
immigration
tax
cuts
and
health
care
when
it
comes
to
trade
that
hasn't
been
so
easy
trump
after
all
came
to
office
as
a
fierce
critic
of
u.s.
trade
policy
arguing
that
previous
administrations
had
been
duped
into
signing
free
trade
agreements
that
had
cost
americans
millions
of
manufacturing
jobs
i
pledge
to
never
sign
any
trade
agreement
that
hurts
our
workers
or
that
diminishes
our
freedom
and
independence
he
said
to
enthusiastic
applause
in
his
nomination
speech
at
the
republican
national
convention
at
times
trump's
rhetoric
on
trade
has
sounded
pretty
much
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
most
liberal
democrats
and
since
taking
office
trump
has
veered
sharply
away
from
traditional
republican
policy
on
trade
through
a
series
of
tariffs
and
trade
wars
that
have
upended
relations
with
the
most
important
u.s.
trading
partners
it's
like
donald
trump
has
co-opted
democratic
trade
policy
says
dan
ikenson
director
of
the
trade
policy
center
at
the
libertarian
cato
institute
democrats
have
long
been
seen
as
the
party
of
the
working
class
and
labor
unions
and
many
shared
a
strong
skepticism
about
trade
agreements
president
bill
clinton
signed
nafta
into
law
but
he
did
so
over
the
opposition
of
most
of
his
fellow
democrats
in
congress
by
the
time
president
barack
obama
spearheaded
the
trans-pacific
partnership
a
massive
trade
pact
involving
a
dozen
pacific
rim
nations
opposition
to
trade
agreements
had
only
hardened
among
both
democrats
and
many
republicans
after
years
of
watching
u.s.
manufacturing
jobs
flee
overseas
american
voters
who
were
once
open
to
free
trade
increasingly
see
it
as
it
harmful
to
american
interests
says
elaine
kamarck
a
former
aide
to
clinton
even
before
trump
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
sort
of
left-right
consensus
that
we
needed
to
do
something
about
trade
and
particularly
something
about
china
says
kamarck
now
a
senior
fellow
at
the
brookings
institution
that
has
left
democratic
politicians
who
once
backed
agreements
like
nafta
in
something
of
a
bind
they
have
responded
by
trying
to
thread
the
needle
arguing
that
trade
is
still
beneficial
as
long
as
it's
done
fairly
in
obama's
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton
went
from
supporting
the
trans-pacific
partnership
to
arguing
that
it
needed
to
be
renegotiated
a
position
now
shared
by
current
front-runner
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
democrats
that
are
running
for
president
are
largely
reflecting
where
democrats
in
congress
have
been
for
decades
and
the
democratic
base
says
lori
wallach
director
of
public
citizen's
global
trade
watch
candidates
like
biden
who
have
been
great
defenders
of
the
failed
status
quo
and
promoters
of
it
and
may
still
on
policy
grounds
believe
in
it
recognize
that
politically
they
just
can't
be
there
anymore
she
adds
other
democratic
candidates
have
sought
to
outflank
trump
with
even
harsher
opposition
to
trade
policy
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
argues
that
trump's
revised
nafta
agreement
with
mexico
and
canada
didn't
go
far
enough
she
has
proposed
a
much
stricter
set
of
regulations
that
would
essentially
bar
the
u.s.
from
trading
with
countries
that
fail
to
uphold
labor
and
environmental
standards
trade
pacts
like
nafta
are
written
by
multinational
corporations
for
their
own
benefit
warren
said
at
a
cnn
debate
in
july
they
have
no
loyalty
to
america
they
have
no
patriotism
if
they
can
save
a
nickel
by
moving
a
job
to
mexico
they'll
do
it
in
a
heartbeat
she
said
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
who
has
long
been
a
fierce
critic
of
u.s.
trade
policy
agreed
if
anybody
here
thinks
that
corporate
america
gives
one
damn
about
the
average
american
worker
you're
mistaken
he
said
other
democrats
have
criticized
trump's
tactics
if
not
his
goals
by
imposing
or
just
threatening
tariffs
against
traditional
u.s.
allies
such
as
canada
europe
and
japan
trump
has
undercut
his
own
negotiating
position
and
made
it
harder
to
take
on
the
real
bad
actor
china
several
candidates
have
said
tariffs
are
a
huge
mistake
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
said
at
the
cnn
debate
they
constitute
the
largest
tax
increase
on
the
american
consumer
hitting
the
middle
class
and
the
working
poor
especially
hard
and
farmers
in
iowa
and
across
the
country
are
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
consequences
the
chaotic
nature
of
trump's
trade
agenda
gives
democrats
an
opening
to
argue
that
despite
his
harsh
rhetoric
he
hasn't
really
delivered
on
trade
kamarck
says
there's
still
no
trade
agreement
with
china
and
the
new
nafta
hasn't
made
it
through
congress
yet
he's
been
on
and
off
and
around
and
up
and
down
and
nobody
knows
where
the
negotiations
stand
and
he
says
things
that
aren't
true
and
so
i
think
on
trade
this
will
come
down
to
a
matter
of
the
president's
competence
kamarck
says
to
ikenson
of
the
pro-trade
cato
institute
the
tenor
of
the
current
debate
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
as
trump
fights
with
china
and
democrats
ramp
up
their
own
rhetoric
no
one
is
left
to
argue
for
the
economic
benefits
of
trade
what
happened
to
the
abandoned
center
ikenson
asks
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
place
where
a
lot
of
good
things
can
happen
