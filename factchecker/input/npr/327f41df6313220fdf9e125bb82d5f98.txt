aug
at
p
m
et
starting
this
month
tens
of
thousands
of
census
bureau
workers
are
knocking
on
doors
across
the
country
to
make
sure
the
bureau
has
a
complete
list
of
addresses
of
where
people
live
in
the
u.s.
those
addresses
determine
where
the
bureau
will
mail
instructions
and
send
the
next
major
deployment
of
workers
in
for
the
constitutionally
mandated
head
count
of
every
resident
which
is
conducted
by
household
if
the
census
bureau
does
not
even
have
the
address
what
they
miss
is
not
just
one
person
it's
the
entire
household
so
it's
serious
stuff
says
jim
chang
arizona's
state
demographer
whose
office
is
working
to
make
sure
all
of
the
state's
home
addresses
are
included
this
canvassing
for
addresses
is
expected
to
be
the
most
visible
on-the-ground
preparation
to
date
for
the
upcoming
census
which
is
set
to
officially
kick
off
in
remote
parts
of
alaska
in
january
before
rolling
out
to
the
rest
of
the
country
by
april
carrying
laptops
and
black
messenger
bags
around
temporary
census
bureau
employees
known
as
listers
are
expected
to
comb
through
neighborhoods
through
october
mainly
in
the
evening
and
during
the
weekend
to
verify
more
than
million
addresses
or
about
a
third
of
all
of
the
country's
home
addresses
the
bureau
has
created
a
map
to
show
which
neighborhoods
it
plans
to
visit
in
person
for
the
other
addresses
the
bureau
agency
has
been
using
satellite
images
from
the
national
geospatial-intelligence
agency
department
of
agriculture
and
digitalglobe
a
private
company
to
check
for
new
homes
and
other
changes
in
neighborhoods
from
computer
screens
at
the
bureau's
headquarters
in
suitland
md
by
comparing
bird's-eye
view
images
from
around
with
more
current
ones
the
bureau
has
been
verifying
home
addresses
it
has
compiled
from
the
u.s.
postal
service
as
well
as
tribal
state
and
local
governments
it's
a
method
that
makes
sense
for
rural
areas
where
many
single-family
homes
are
difficult
to
reach
in
person
says
wenlin
liu
the
chief
economist
for
the
state
of
wyoming
many
of
the
roads
are
not
paved
so
you
may
miss
some
ranch
roads
liu
explains
many
of
our
communities
live
in
open
grassland
plains
areas
so
for
the
satellite
image
you
can
clearly
identify
relying
more
on
satellite
images
for
the
count
than
for
past
censuses
is
also
expected
to
help
the
bureau
cut
down
on
the
cost
of
sending
workers
to
verify
addresses
one
of
the
most
expensive
parts
of
conducting
a
census
along
with
deploying
door
knockers
to
interview
households
that
don't
respond
to
questionnaires
themselves

for
the

the
bureau
is
hiring
about
a
third
of
the
close
to
temporary
workers
needed
in
to
canvass
just
about
every
street
in
the
states
and
puerto
rico
for
around
million
the
bureau
estimates
the
current
fieldwork
to
total
million
these
workers
will
be
needed
to
check
addresses
in
more
densely
populated
parts
of
the
country
as
well
as
areas
where
homes
are
obscured
by
trees
or
clouds
in
satellite
images
the
photos
are
also
not
effective
for
identifying
homes
within
high-rise
buildings
and
usually
cannot
help
detect
what
the
bureau
calls
hidden
housing
such
as
converted
garages
and
basements
people
can
put
up
sheetrock
and
turn
the

probably
it's

have
all
kinds

that's
why
sending
listers
to
look
in
person
for
clues
such
as
multiple
doorbells
or
mailboxes
outside
a
home
has
been
critical
to
getting
an
accurate
census
in
the
past
especially
within
ethnic
enclaves
and
other
hard-to-count
communities
living
in
densely
populated
areas
perlich
is
concerned
however
that
distrust
of
the
government
in
light
of
increased
immigration
enforcement
and
the
current
political
climate
may
make
it
difficult
for
the
bureau
to
verify
addresses
with
all
the
things
that
you
hear
the
language
that's
being
used
around
new
americans
it's
gonna
be
difficult
to
get
them
to
even
answer

door
perlich
says
this
just
compounds
that
probability
that
people
are
going

be
missed
cesar
espinosa
executive
director
of
the
houston-based
immigrant
advocacy
group
fiel
says
he
is
worried
that
the
damage
has
already
been
done
by
controversy
over
the
now-blocked
citizenship
question
the
trump
administration
failed
to
add
to
the
census
which
he
fears
will
lead
to
a
bad
census
count
in
the
houston
area
home
to
the
third-largest
unauthorized
immigrant
population
in
the
u.s.
according
to
estimates
by
the
pew
research
center
still
fiel
is
preparing
to
answer
questions
from
community
members
about
whether
they
should
open
their
doors
once
address
canvassing
ramps
up
while
espinosa's
organization
is
encouraging
members
to
talk
to
census
bureau
workers
whose
employment
they
can
verify
through
photo
ids
and
on
the
bureau's
website
fiel
has
also
advised
houston
residents
to
be
extra
cautious
about
letting
strangers
inside
their
homes
in
light
of
recent
reports
of
expected
raids
by
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
officers
we
still
haven't
found
a
way
to
really
counteract
that
in
the
long
run
and
we
know
that
that's
going
to
be
an
issue
with
the
census
espinosa
says
after
address
canvassing
is
complete
in
october
there
is
still
a
chance
for
states
to
fill
in
any
gaps
the
bureau
is
planning
to
consult
with
officials
like
perlich
through
a
program
for
reviewing
any
addresses
that
may
have
been
left
out
