on

polls
closed
saturday
in
afghanistan's
presidential
election
amid
reports
of
historically
low
voter
turnout
due
to
taliban
threats
chaos
among
candidates
and
flawed
voting
procedures
about
million
afghans
are
registered
to
vote
but
only
a
fraction
were
expected
to
cast
a
ballot
fewer
than
the
presidential
election
or
the
parliamentary
elections
reporter
jennifer
glasse
told
npr's
weekend
edition
a
report
from
the
afghanistan
analysts
network
puts
rough
estimates
of
turnout
from
the
independent
election
commission
or
iec
at
under
million
voters
this
means
a
small
percentage
of
the
country
will
determine
the
democracy's
fate
the
two
front-runners
incumbent
president
ashraf
ghani
and
his
chief
executive
abdullah
abdullah
have
shared
power
since
the
presidential
elections
in
a
compromise
negotiated
by
former
u.s.
secretary
of
state
john
kerry
in
that
race
abdullah
had
accused
ghani
of
rigging
the
election
citing
an
alleged
million
fraudulent
votes
and
again
warned
of
a
possible
illegitimate
ghani
victory
in
saturday's
election
the
american
officials
are
adamant
that
they
will
not
ride
to
the
rescue
again
said
kate
clark
the
co-director
of
afghanistan
analysts
network
a
kabul-based
policy
research
organization
adding
that
the
sentiment
stems
from
a
stronger
opinion
in
washington
that
afghans
have
to
sort
things
out
themselves
preliminary
results
are
expected
on
oct
and
final
results
on
nov
with
candidates
on
the
ballot
there
is
a
chance
that
no
one
candidate
will
receive
a
majority
of
votes
which
will
force
a
second
ballot
between
the
top
two
candidates
another
prominent
candidate
and
former
warlord
gulbuddin
hekmatyar
warned
that
if
the
vote
wasn't
fair
and
transparent
he
would
call
on
his
thousands
of
supporters
across
the
country
to
perhaps
go
back
to
the
battlefield
according
to
glasse
hekmatyar
is
running
on
behalf
of
his
hezb-e-islami
party
a
former
militia
that
signed
a
peace
deal
with
the
ghani
administration
in
in
an
interview
with
the
associated
press
former
president
hamid
karzai
who
still
wields
significant
political
power
in
afghanistan
said
that
saturday's
election
has
all
the
potential
and
possibilities
to
lead
the
country
further
down
to
the
abyss
of
crisis
and
insecurity
and
divisions
karzai
said
he
believes
elections
should
be
held
after
peace
is
negotiated
between
the
u.s.
the
afghan
government
and
the
taliban
glasse
said
that
many
afghans
thought
peace
talks
would
preclude
the
presidential
elections
the
one
thing
everyone
agrees
with
wherever
you
go
in
afghanistan
is
they
want
the
fighting
to
stop
they
would
like
to
see
peace
glasse
said
the
election
which
had
already
been
pushed
back
twice
comes
after
peace
talks
between
the
u.s.
and
the
taliban
collapsed
earlier
this
month
prompting
a
spate
of
attacks
throughout
the
country
by
the
islamic
insurgent
group
the
concessions
made
looked
like
a
withdrawal
agreement
in
the
end
clark
said
referring
to
the
failed
peace
deal
the
taliban
didn't
give
what
they
needed
to
give
and
if
it
had
been
signed
many
within
the
taliban
were
thinking
it
gave
them
carte
blanche
to
march
into
kabul
they
didn't
see
it
as
a
peace
agreement
they
saw
it
as
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
their
main
and
most
deadly
opponent
on
sept
the
taliban
claimed
responsibility
for
two
suicide
bombings
that
killed
people
one
of
the
bombings
targeted
a
ghani
campaign
rally
where
ghani
himself
was
present
the
taliban
had
warned
afghan
civilians
not
to
vote
go
to
polling
centers
or
participate
in
any
election-related
efforts
the
ap

that
tens
of
thousands
of
afghan
security
officers
were
deployed
throughout
the
country
to
ensure
that
the
polling
centers
are
protected
from
taliban
attacks

decision
leave
