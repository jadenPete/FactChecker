president
trump
and

opponents
jockeyed
for
advantage
on
monday
as
washington
girded
for
a
drawn-out
conflict
over
the
white
house
and
ukraine
trump
and
his
aides
sought
to
throw
the
spotlight
on
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
who
they
said
might
be
connected
with
what
they
called
corruption
in
ukraine
although
biden's
camp
insists
those
allegations
have
been
debunked
democrats
meanwhile
blasted
the
white
house
over
its
conversations
with
ukrainian
leaders
conversations
that
may
have
sought
political
dirt
on
the
bidens
for
use
in
the
u.s.
presidential
election
that's
not
only
inappropriate
but
potentially
impeachable
they
said
raising
the
temperature
within
a
party
already
divided
over
how
or
whether
to
try
to
hold
trump
accountable
for
moderate
members
of
congress
watching
events
unfold
via
news
reports
citing
unnamed
sources
the
incipient
ukraine
imbroglio
became
a
waiting
game
predicated
upon
lawmakers
receipt
of
more
solid
information
via
official
channels
if
the
president
asked
or
pressured
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
his
political
rival
either
directly
or
through
his
personal
attorney
it
would
be
troubling
in
the
extreme
critical
for
the
facts
to
come
out

democratic
rep
vicente
gonzalez
who
had
not
previously
supported
impeachment
shifted
his
position
when
pressed
by
cnn
on
monday
about
reports
that
the
president
pushed
a
foreign
leader
to
find
damaging
information
on
his
opponent
i
don't
think
we
have
a
choice
he
said
under
the
constitution
we
must
move
forward
with
impeachment
proceedings
i
don't
think
we'll
have
much
of
a
choice
the
next
milestone
is
scheduled
for
thursday
when
the
house
intelligence
committee
is
scheduled
to
hear
from
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
one
question
is
whether
maguire
will
give
lawmakers
a
copy
of
a
complaint
filed
by
a
whistleblower
within
the
intelligence
community
about
trump's
conversation
with
a
foreign
leader
if
the
complaint
is
revealed
and
it
pertains
to
trump's
talks
with
ukraine
or
if
members
of
congress
learn
something
else
that
changes
the
dynamics
of
this
story
the
next
question
is
what
that
may
mean
for
the
positions
taken
by
romney
and
others
about
how
congress
should
respond
unanswered
questions
if
the
outlines
of
the
story
are
coming
into
focus
however
the
details
are
still
far
from
clear
trump
has
acknowledged
that
he
spoke
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
about
biden
but
trump
also
says
his
conversation
was
aboveboard
and
an
attorney
for
trump
rudy
giuliani
says
he
too
has
been
talking
with
ukrainian
officials
but
giuliani
says
trump
didn't
threaten
to
curtail
military
aid
flowing
to
kyiv
unless
zelenskiy
ginned
up
political
ammunition
against
the
bidens
what
giuliani
did
tell
fox
news
on
sunday
was
that
biden's
family
has
been
taking
money
from
his
public
office
for
years
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
also
appeared
on
fox
news
said
he
hopes
the
government
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
whether
there
was
any
wrongdoing
by
biden
in
ukraine
trump
held
up
aid
to
ukraine
from
the
summer
until
this
month
following
years
of
u.s.
support
prompted
by
russia's
invasion
in
but
it
isn't
clear
whether
a
transcript
of
the
president's
phone
call
or
other
material
might
connect
the
assistance
to
ukraine
with
the
biden
discussions
trump
hasn't
ruled
out
releasing
a
transcript
of
his
conversation
with
zelenskiy
or
permitting
giuliani
to
appear
before
congress
although
it
wasn't
clear
when
or
if
either
might
happen
biden
called
for
trump
to
release
the
transcript
in
a
post
on
twitter
on
monday
afternoon
in
remarks
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
on
monday
trump
alluded
to
corruption
in
ukraine
in
one
gaggle
with
reporters
and
later
said
that
what
he
called
biden's
transgressions
had
been
serious

president

up

volume

in
the
day
after
a
meeting
with

president
andrzej
duda
joe
biden

his

trump
said
but
the
fake
news
doesn't
want
to

it
because
they

mcconnell
said
in
a
speech
on
the
senate
floor
that
the
senate
intelligence
committee
is
doing
its
own
work
looking
into
the
whistleblower
matter
but
he
didn't
say
when
it
might
hear
from
maguire
or
whether
that
might
take
place
in
an
open
session
the
majority
leader
also
defended
what
he
called
republicans
record
on
assistance
to
ukraine
against
russian
aggression
and
observed
that
he'd
urged
then-president
barack
obama
to
supply
kyiv
with
weapons
not
just
nonlethal
assistance
which
obama
declined
to
do
but
which
trump
has
critics
see
an
abuse
of
power
for
democrats
trump's
actions
in
the
ukraine
matter
have
amounted
to
an
abuse
of
his
office
made
all
the
more
flagrant
since
it
ignored
months
of
back-and-forth
about
foreign
influence
in
u.s.
elections
justice
department
special
counsel
robert
mueller
documented
the
russian
attack
on
the
election
and
the
many
contacts
between
trump's
camp
and
russians
but
did
not
establish
a
conspiracy
between
the
two
to
throw
the
election
what
mueller
did
establish
democrats
argue
is
that
it's
improper
and
illegal
for
americans
to
solicit
foreign
help
for
a
political
campaign
as
they
charge
trump
may
have
done
in
the
ukraine
affair
that
was
enough
for
some
of
the
president's
toughest
critics
to
insist
he
be
removed
as
california
sen
kamala
harris
did
for
example
over
the
weekend
the
most
anti-trump
members
in
the
house
said
that
what
they
called
the
president's
transgressions
were
being
emboldened
by
a
failure
of
congress
to
respond
the
integrity
of
our

isn't
threatened

the
impeachment
dilemma
what
remains
unclear
however
is
whether
the
ukraine
affair
might
move
the
needle
on
impeachment
inside
washington
with
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
or
broadly
among
the
american
people
although
many
democrats
support
impeaching
trump
most
americans
have
told
pollsters
they
don't
and
although
many
members
of
the
democratic
majority
in
the
house
want
some
kind
of
impeachment
process
to
move
forward
mcconnell
and
his
majority
continue
to
control
the
senate
trump
has
counted
on
that
bulwark
and
even
seemed
to
dare
democrats
to
move
ahead
with
impeachment
proceedings
on
the
expectation
that
whatever
their
result
in
the
house
they'd
stall
in
the
senate
and
wind
up
doing
more
damage
to
pelosi
