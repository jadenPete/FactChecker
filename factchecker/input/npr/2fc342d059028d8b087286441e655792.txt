polls
so

n.h.
last

there's
lots
being
made
of
the
fact
that
this
is
the
first
time
during
this
presidential
campaign
that
biden
and
warren
will
share
the
debate
stage
the
question
is
whether
they
engage
and
on
what
they
signaled
that
they
might
mix
it
up
warren
has
gotten
attention
for
her
myriad
plans
but
a
biden
adviser
told
cnn
that
the
former
vice
president
will
likely
argue
in
the
debate
that
we
need
more
than
plans
one
area
ripe
for
debate
is
on
bankruptcy
law
an
issue
where
they
have
a
history
can
biden
take
the
heat

during

mich
in
the
first
two
debates
varying
candidates
have
picked
fights
with
biden
harris
on
busing
booker
on
criminal
justice
and
so
on
and
he'll
likely
be
the
focus
of
criticism
from
other
candidates
because
of
his
continued
lead
in
the
polls
but
despite
some
missteps
on
the
campaign
trail
and
a
lackluster
first
debate
his
brand
has
shown
resiliency
he
not
only
leads
the
race
nationally
and
in
many
state
polls
but
he's
also
extremely
well
liked
among
the
democratic
base
something
you'd
likely
never
know
if
you
only
read
twitter
a
point
his
campaign
makes
repeatedly
that
makes
him
a
target
for
the
other
candidates
who
have
to
be
wondering
what
it
will
take
to
dislodge
him
still
democratic
strategists
see
biden
as
a
fragile
front-runner
and
he
has
to
have
solid
outings
in
these
coming
debates
that
will
likely
get
more
attention
than
the
first
couple
of
rounds
will
the
candidates
double
down
on
positions
unpopular
with
general-election
voters
a
lot
of
the
moderate
democratic
candidates
are
not
on
the
stage
for
this
debate
montana
gov
steve
bullock
colorado
sen
michael
bennet
and
former
maryland
rep
john
delaney
did
not
qualify
and
former
colorado
gov
john
hickenlooper
dropped
out
to
run
for
the
senate
that
means
the
progressives
are
likely
to
again
target
biden
and
focus
on
issues
unpopular
outside
of
democrats
like
medicare
for
all
as
a
replacement
to
private
insurance
health
care
for
immigrants
in

earlier
this

warren
is
getting
lots
of
attention
and
was
not
only
the
most
popular
candidate
among
democrats
in
the
latest
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
she's
now
caught
up
with
and
even
passed
in
some
instances
fellow
progressive
sanders
in
an
average
of
the
polls
that
has
to
grate
on
sanders
even
if
people
close
to
him
continue
to
say
that
he
sees
warren
as
an
ally
for
the
kind
of
change
he
wants
to
see
in
the
country
they
have
maintained
that
sanders
will
not
go
after
warren
unless
they
are
the
last
two
standing
but
they
also
privately
point
out
differences
such
as
on
foreign
policy
and
party
politics
it's
probably
not
the
time
yet
for
sanders
to
need
to
go
after
warren
but
could
some
prickliness
begin
to
emerge
what
kind
of
chances
do
candidates
needing
a
breakout
take
if
a
candidate
hasn't
had
a
moment
yet
they
now
have
a
chance
to
do
something
to
gain
attention
and
create
a
spark
for
their
campaign
before
a
large
audience
yang
for
one
is
promising
to
do
something
no
one's
done
what
exactly
no
one
knows
but
yang
is
hoping
you
tune
in
at
the
same
time
it's
not
clear
how
many
people
will
tune
in
the
latest
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
found
that
more
people
said
they
weren't
going
to
watch
than
