the
cherokee
nation
has
named
its
first
delegate
to
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
former
obama
appointee
kimberly
teehee's
nomination
was
approved
by
the
tribe's
council
on
thursday
although
the
treaty
that
created
this
nonvoting
position
is
almost
years
old
it
had
never
been
filled
the
article
outlining
the
right
to
a
delegate
is
in
the
treaty
of
new
echota
the
treaty
is
also
the
document
that
led
to
the
trail
of
tears
something
that
has
been
top
of
mind
for
teehee
she
points
out
the
treaty
gave
up
the
cherokee's
homelands
and
cost
the
tribe
thousands
of
lives
literally
blood
sweat
and
tears
teehee
said
we
can't
ignore
that
history
and
what
it
meant
for
us
to
have
a
provision
like
that
put
in
place
given
the
devastation
that
occurred
and
the
deaths
that
occurred
teehee
grew
up
in
oklahoma
and
cut
her
teeth
in
politics
in
the
s
interning
for
wilma
mankiller
the
first
woman
to
become
chief
of
the
cherokee
nation
mankiller
led
the
tribe
at
a
time
when
it
was
reasserting
its
sovereignty
on
both
a
state
and
national
level
teehee
says
watching
mankiller
become
one
of
the
most
effective
cherokee
chiefs
in
modern
history
was
inspiring
she
let
me
go
to
meetings
with
her
i
got
to
travel
with
her
got
to
research
for
her
she
said
she
was
so
hands-on
with
me
i
loved
it
mankiller
advised
teehee
that
when
she
returned
to
college
from
her
internship
the
young
woman
should
consider
getting
a
law
degree
because
there's
a
lot
of
indian
issues
being
litigated
in
the
federal
courts
and
those
decisions
are
having
an
impact
on
tribes
and
it's
going
to
become
more
complicated
to
lead
teehee
said
law
school
and
political
appointments
teehee
would
go
on
to
get
that
law
degree
and
later
she
worked
for
the
democratic
national
committee
as
a
hill
staffer
and
then
an
obama
appointee
teehee
has
been
an
outsize
figure
on
capitol
hill
for
decades
when
it
comes
to
indian
country
policy
her
fingerprints
are
on
a
wide
variety
of
policy
and
laws
affecting
indigenous
people
from
the
violence
against
women
act
to
the
creation
of
congress
first
native
american
caucus
as
a
delegate
in
congress
who
can
attend
committee
meetings
teehee
would
have
the
opportunity
to
advocate
not
just
for
the
cherokee
nation
but
for
all
tribes
said
lindsay
robertson
who
teaches
federal
indian
law
at
the
university
of
oklahoma
college
of
law
you'd
have
somebody
in
the
halls
of
congress
all
the
time
with
access
and
rights
of
participation
and
debate
who
is
raising
native
american
issues
constantly
he
said
the
appointment
still
needs
congressional
approval
and
robertson
says
it
will
likely
take
time
for
congress
to
figure
out
exactly
how
to
seat
teehee
but
the
treaty
language
is
very
clear
the
cherokee
nation
is
entitled
to
a
delegate
bipartisan
connections
one
thing
that
could
help
teehee's
chances
of
being
seated
is
her
reputation
on
the
hill
for
bipartisan
work
she
has
close
relationships
with
oklahoma
republicans
markwayne
mullin
also
a
member
of
the
cherokee
nation
and
tom
cole
a
member
of
the
chickasaw
nation
newly
elected
chief
of
the
cherokee
nation
chuck
hoskin
jr
made
teehee's
appointment
one
of
his
administration's
first
priorities
he
said
her
ability
to
reach
across
the
aisle
on
a
number
of
important
areas
for
indian
country
is
what
led
him
to
choose
teehee
for
the
position
one
thing
that
i
have
learned
is
that
you
never
know
what
the
next
issue
will
be
and
so
we
need
somebody
that
is
nimble
has
studied
up
on
the
issues
and
is
a
quick
study
when
those
things
come
up
hoskin
said
for
her
part
teehee
says
she
understands
her
appointment
will
help
bring
visibility
to
a
nearly
invisible
part
of
american
society
and
that
could
have
a
lasting
impact
on
areas
like
indian
health
services
funding
education
expansion
on
tribal
lands
and
treaty
rights
like
the
one
that
led
to
her
appointment
the
education
piece
of
it
also
means
what
do
treaty
rights
actually
mean
why
do
these
old
documents
still
live
today
in
this
case
the
treaty
of
new
echota
a
document
that
led
to
the
horrors
of
genocide
nearly
years
ago
could
today
lead
to
a
new
chapter
in
relations
between
the
u.s.
and
the
cherokee
nation
