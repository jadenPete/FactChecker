updated

house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
vowed
thursday
he
is
willing
to
sue
the
trump
administration
over
a
dispute
about
the
content
of
an
as-yet-unknown
complaint
to
the
intelligence
community's
official
watchdog
schiff
told
reporters
after
a
closed-door
meeting
with
the
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
that
the
justice
department
has
opined
that
the
material
is
shielded
by
privilege
and
can
be
withheld
from
lawmakers
not
so
schiff
argued
and
if
we
have
to
go
to
court
to
get
this
we
will
have
a
good
case
the
dispute
is
over
a
complaint
to
atkinson
brought
by
someone
inside
the
spy
world
over
activity
involving
someone
high-ranking
which
schiff
said
very
likely
means
trump
or
someone
close
to
him
newspapers
have
reported
the
basis
of
the
complaint
involved
something
trump
said
to
a
foreign
leader
schiff
said
on
thursday
he
doesn't
know
whether
that
is
accurate
but
he
argued
the
law
and
practice
are
clear
congress
oversees
the
spy
agencies
and
in
this
case
it
must
see
the
materials
at
issue
if
any
party
whether
it's
the
department
of
justice
or
the
white
house
or
someone
indeed
who
may
be
the
subject
of
the
complaint
is
able
to
deprive
congress
of
that
information
simply
because
they
choose
to
then
the
whistleblower
statute
doesn't
work
at
all
and
it
chills
people
from
coming
forward
schiff
told
npr
thursday
afternoon
trump
scoffs
president
trump
denied
on
thursday
he
said
anything
inappropriate
to
a
foreign
leader
the
washington
post
reported
that
trump
in
a
phone
call
with
an
unnamed
foreign
leader
made
an
unspecified
promise
that
so
alarmed
one
member
of
the
intelligence
community
it
yielded
the
complaint
in
a
series
of
tweets
trump
called
the
report
fake
news
virtually
anytime
i
speak
on
the
phone
to
a
foreign
leader
i
understand
that
there
may
be
many
people
listening
from
various
u.s.
agencies
not
to
mention
those
from
the
other
country
itself
trump
wrote
adding
no
problem
trump
went
on
to
wonder
is
anybody
dumb
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
say
something
inappropriate
with
a
foreign
leader
while
on
such
a
potentially
heavily
populated
call
i
would
only
do
what
is
right
anyway
and
only
do
good
for
the
usa
schiff
said
in
an
earlier
statement
that
the
intelligence
community's
ig
determined
that
this
complaint
is
both
credible
and
urgent
and
that
it
should
be
transmitted
to
congress
under
the
clear
letter
of
the
law
the
committee
places
the
highest
importance
on
the
protection
of
whistle-blowers
and
their
complaints
to
congress
schiff
said
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
will
testify
in
an
open
session
before
the
panel
next
week
we
will
hear
more
we
will
learn
more
he
said
and
if
that
hearing
does
not
answer
some
of
these
questions
schiff
said
he
will
confer
with
the
house's
general
counsel
about
legal
action
the
committee
later
released
letters
it
received
from
the
inspector
general
the
panel
also
released
a
letter
from
schiff
to
acting
dni
maguire
the
alleged
phone
call
the
post
reported
that
the
as-yet-unknown
intelligence
official
filed
a
formal
complaint
to
the
ig
on
aug
and
that
records
show
the
president
had
conversations
or
interactions
with
five
foreign
leaders
in
the
preceding
weeks
including
a
phone
call
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
two
letters
from
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
other
members
of
congress
away
from
schiff's
committee
say
they
are
waiting
to
learn
more
about
what's
behind
all
the
hubbub
sen
john
cornyn
r-texas
who
sits
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
said
he
believes
his
panel
may
be
next
in
line
i'm
anxious
to
hear
more
about
it
but
i
expect
we
will
in
due
course
he
said
new
battle
old
war
the
contretemps
over
the
ig
complaint
is
the
latest
political
battle
between
schiff
and
trump
who
skirmished
for
months
during
the
height
of
the
russia
imbroglio
schiff
was
among
democrats
who
said
there
was
evidence
that
trump's
camp
colluded
with
the
russian
attack
on
the
election
citing
the
meeting
that
donald
trump
jr
and
other
top
aides
took
with
a
delegation
from
moscow
that
year
at
trump
tower
but
schiff
also
alluded
to
evidence
that
wasn't
public
including
with
questions
about
whether
trump
jr
s
phone
records
from
before
the
trump
tower
meeting
might
suggest
that
he
had
spoken
with
his
father
as
it
was
being
arranged
as
it
turned
out
they
did
not
and
trump
jr
and
the
president
have
made
schiff
a
target
of
mockery
and
one
of
the
faces
of
what
trump
says
is
baseless
hounding
the
president
revived
that
leitmotif
on
thursday
with
another
post
on
twitter
that
complained
about
presidential
harassment
