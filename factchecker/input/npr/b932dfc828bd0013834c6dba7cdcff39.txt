of

and
human

earlier
this

prohibit

acting
president
in
a
conference
call
monday
the
impact
of
the
trump
administration's
gag
rule
will
reverberate
across
the
country
officials
say
that
means
patients
are
likely
to
see
longer
wait
times
or
increased
costs
for
reproductive
health
services
planned
parenthood
and
other
medical
groups
say
the
rule
is
unethical
and
interferes
with
the
doctor-patient
relationship
abortion-rights
opponents
meanwhile
have
long
argued
for
a
complete
separation
between
federal
dollars
and
any
organization
involved
in
providing
or
facilitating
abortions
the
announcement
follows
a
letter
submitted
by
planned
parenthood
last
week
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
th
circuit
an
attorney
for
planned
parenthood
said
the
organization
had
hoped
to
remain
in
the
program
but
stop
using
title
x
funds
while
the
matter
is
being
litigated
but
the
letter
says
recent
guidance
from
hhs
informed
grantees
that
they
would
have
to
leave
the
program
if
they
could
not
show
good-faith
efforts
to
comply
the
letter
expresses
deep
regret
but
says
planned
parenthood
clinics
now
have
no
option
but
to
withdraw
from
the
title
x
program
in
a
statement
to
npr
monday
hhs
officials
said
every
grantee
had
the
choice
to
accept
the
grant
and
comply
with
the
program's
regulations
or
not
accept
the
grant
if
they
did
not
want
to
comply
some
grantees
are
now
blaming
the
government
for
their
own
actions
having
chosen
to
accept
the
grant
while
failing
to
comply
with
the
regulations
that
accompany
it
and
they
are
abandoning
their
obligations
to
serve
their
patients
under
the
program
planned
parenthood's
withdrawal
from
the
million
federal
program
represents
a
significant
shift
in
the
way
the
family
planning
program
operates
the
organization
has
been
involved
in
the
program
since
its
inception
and
officials
say
it
serves
about
of
the
nation's
million

doreen
denny
senior
director
of
government
relations
for
concerned
women
for
america
which
opposes
abortion
rights
called
the
news
a
day
of
reckoning
and
decision
for
planned
parenthood
i
think
that
planned
parenthood
certainly
knew
that
they
had
a
choice
to
make
when
they
first
applied
for
grants
this
round
they
knew
that
these
rules
could
take
effect
denny
said
so
this
isn't
a
surprise
to
them
abortion-rights
opponents
have
called
on
political
leaders
to
defund
planned
parenthood
and
have
praised
president
trump
for
his
administration's
efforts
to
deliver
on
his
campaign
promise
to
do
just
that
the
impact
of
the
rule
change
is
not
limited
to
planned
parenthood
maine's

is
also
withdrawing
in
a
letter
to
hhs
ceo
george
hill
said
his
group
is
leaving
the
program
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
emily
nestler
is
an
attorney
with
the
center
for
reproductive
rights
which
is
representing
maine
family
planning
in
its
own
legal
challenge
to
the
trump
administration
rules
she
said
the
move
could
force
as
many
as
clinics
to
close
in
the
largely
rural
state
today
is
the
tipping
point
i
think
and
you're
going
to
really
see
the
unwinding
of
a
program
that
has
provided
extraordinary
care
and
been
a
huge
success
for
decades
nestler
said
in
an
interview
with
npr
anti-abortion
advocates
say
they
hope
the
changes
to
the
title
x
program
will
open
up
funding
for
other
groups
including
religiously
based
organizations
and
crisis
pregnancy
centers
that
counsel
women
against
abortions
some
of
those
groups
do
not
provide
a
full
range
of
contraceptive
services
