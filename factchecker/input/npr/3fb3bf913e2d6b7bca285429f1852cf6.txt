president
trump
says
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
and
major
taliban
leaders
were
set
to
meet
with
him
at
camp
david
on
sunday
but
he
canceled
the
negotiations
after
learning
about
a
taliban
attack
trump
added
that
he
called
off
further
peace
negotiations
with
the
taliban
talks
that
had
been
ongoing
for
months
and
were
said
to
be
near
completion
in
a
series
of
tweets
on
saturday
the
president
said
the
camp
david
talks
were
supposed
to
be
a
secret
unbeknownst
to
almost
everyone
the
major
taliban
leaders
and
separately
the
president
of
afghanistan
were
going
to
secretly
meet
with
me
at
camp
david
on
sunday
they
were
coming
to
the
united
states
tonight
the
president
wrote
before
the
meeting
could
take
place
trump
said
the
taliban
admitted
to
an
attack
in
kabul
that
killed
people
including
a
u.s.
soldier
if
they
cannot
agree
to
a
ceasefire
during
these
very
important
peace
talks
and
would
even
kill
innocent
people
then
they
probably
don't
have
the
power
to
negotiate
a
meaningful
agreement
anyway
trump
tweeted
the
white
house
and
the
state
department
both
declined
to
offer
any
further
details
about
trump's
statement
a
spokesman
for
the
taliban
said
that
the
group
had
learned
of
the
cancellation
only
through
the
media
and
that
u.s.
officials
had
not
formally
notified
them
suhail
shaheen
the
insurgents
spokesman
said
taliban
officials
wanted
to
meet
and
discuss
the
latest
developments
before
responding
further
this
is
not
the
first
time
an
announcement
by
trump
has
disrupted
negotiations
on
aug
trump
told
fox
news
radio
that
he
was
planning
to
wind
down
troop
numbers
in
afghanistan
to
for
the
time
being
that
outraged
taliban
officials
who
told
npr
that
they
were
negotiating
for
a
full
not
partial
withdrawal
of
foreign
forces
in
exchange
for
promises
that
they
would
not
allow
the
country
to
become
a
base
for
global
terrorism
the
announcement
of
the
talks
cancellation
may
be
a
partial
relief
to
many
afghans
who
fear
that
a
withdrawal
of
u.s.
troops
would
embolden
insurgents
to
step
up
their
violent
attacks
against
afghan
security
forces
which
would
be
badly
weakened
in
the
case
of
any
withdrawal
the
taliban
already
contest
or
control
more
than
half
of
afghanistan
a
u.s.
withdrawal
could
encourage
the
group
to
march
onto
kabul
triggering
an
even
more
violent
and
chaotic
round
of
conflict
and
activists
fear
that
the
taliban
gaining
more
power
would
quickly
erode
fragile
gains
for
women's
rights
and
democracy
until
now
it
had
appeared
that
the
u.s.
was
nearing
a
deal
with
the
taliban
that
would
bring
home
some
if
not
all
of
the
u.s.
troops
still
stationed
in
afghanistan
the
u.s.
and
the
taliban
have
held
multiple
rounds
of
talks
this
year
in
qatar
trump
has
argued
repeatedly
that
it's
time
to
end
the
war
that
has
dragged
on
for
nearly
two
decades
