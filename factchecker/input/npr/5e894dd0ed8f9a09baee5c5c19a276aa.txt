cokie
roberts
makes
a
speech
at
the
buell
theatre
in
denver
cokie
roberts
was
fierce
and
funny
hard-nosed
and
kindhearted
she
was
steeped
in
politics
as
the
daughter
of
two
louisiana
pols
hale
and
lindy
boggs
and
enjoyed
the
game
but
she
also
elevated
politics
with
her
elegant
reporting
cokie
wasn't
fooled
by
the
blather
of
politicians
but
also
wasn't
smug
about
journalism
we
covered
a
few
primaries
and
papal
trips
together
and
cokie
used
to
caution
young
reporters
with
preconceptions
stories
are
so
simple
until
you
actually
cover
them
it
may
be
hard
for
many
to
understand
today
how
great
female
reporters
used
to
often
be
assigned
just
to
cover
flower
shows
dog
pageants
and
recipes
but
cokie
roberts
covered
the
u.s.
congress
for
a
fledgling
npr
while
linda
wertheimer
reported
on
politics
and
nina
totenberg
covered
the
nation's
highest
court
susan
stamberg
gave
npr
a
distinctive
voice
astute
and
warm
not
sonorous
they've
been
called
npr's
founding
mothers
who
brought
the
voices
of
women
into
the
news
and
made
npr
into
a
fixture
of
american
life
there
are
women
with
vital
jobs
all
over
america
today
who
came
of
age
hearing
cokie
and
those
other
voices
but
in
a
profession
that
can
consume
people
cokie
roberts
stayed
herself
she
had
a
genius
for
friendship
she
wrote
notes
and
made
calls
she
brought
food
and
books
to
friends
when
they
were
sick
or
sad
she
remembered
birthdays
and
wrote
job
recommendations
she
laughed
she
cackled
at
all
kinds
of
jokes
cokie
once
called
a
hospital
when
she
heard
i'd
been
brought
in
with
typhoid
fever
contracted
while
covering
a
war
and
demanded
to
speak
to
the
chief
physician
he
found
me
in
the
emergency
room
and
said
with
astonishment
you
know
cokie
roberts
she
called
to
tell
me
to
take
care
of
you
my
hospital
food
improved
immediately
our
mothers
died
within
days
of
each
other
a
few
summers
ago
both
of
our
mothers
had
taught
us
the
importance
of
writing
notes
so
cokie
and
i
sent
emails
that
crossed
at
almost
the
same
instant
we
both
woke
up
this
morning
without
a
mother
said
cokie
but
two
classy
gals
will
be
friends
up
there
she
told
people
she
certainly
told
me
and
she
exemplified
it
to
make
time
in
your
life
and
space
in
your
heart
for
family
friendships
and
faith
cokie
blazed
a
trail
in
this
business
and
a
trail
of
friendship
in
so
many
lives
