there
is
widespread
support
among
americans
democrats
republicans
and
gun
owners
alike
for
a
number
of
initiatives
to
curb
gun
violence
they
would
like
to
see
congress
pass
according
to
a
new
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
laws
that
would
screen
for
the
types
of
people
who
could
use
a
gun
are
broadly
popular
but
when
it
comes
to
bans
on
certain
types
of
weapons
and
ammunition
a
divide
emerges
increasing
funding
for
mental
health
screenings
and
treatment
universal
background
checks
red
flag
laws
and
requiring
gun
licenses
all
get
broad
bipartisan
support
as
well
as
the
support
of
a
majority
of
gun
owners
red
flag
laws
also
known
as
extreme-risk
protection
orders
allow
police
or
family
members
to
request
that
a
judge
temporarily
remove
guns
from
people
who
may
be
a
danger
to
themselves
or
others
you'd
be
hard-pressed
to
find
something
where
the
gap
between
public
sentiment
and
legislative
action
or
inaction
is
wider
because
you've
got
a
clear
consensus
across
party
lines
said
lee
miringoff
director
of
the
marist
institute
for
public
opinion
which
conducted
the
poll
the
gap
is
huge
and
the
congressional
crowd
is
very
much
out
of
step
with
where
public
opinion
is
on
this
and
therein
lies
the
frustration
of
many
americans
as
the
frequency
of
these
shootings
increases
after
a
summer
that
saw
high-profile
mass
shootings
in
dayton
ohio
el
paso
texas
and
odessa
texas
congress
is
back
and
there
is
a
renewed
push
to
pass
gun
restrictions
but
republican
congressional
leadership
is
deferring
to
president
trump
democrats
have
made
implementing
gun
restrictions
a
top
priority
but
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
declined
to
bring
anything
to
the
senate
floor
until
he
is
certain
of
what
trump
will
support
they
the
white
house
are
working
on
coming
up
with
a
proposal
that
the
president
will
sign
until
that
happens
all
of
this
is
theatrics
mcconnell
said
on
tuesday
after
a
briefing
with
white
house
legislative
affairs
director
eric
ueland
trump
has
wavered
on
whether
he
even
wants
universal
background
checks
passed
without
the
president's
support
passage
of
any
gun
restrictions
is
highly
unlikely
bans
and
overall
sentiment
on
guns
prove
more
divisive
majorities
of
americans
support
bans
on
high-capacity
ammunition
magazines
and
assault-style
weapons
but
there
are
gaps
between
the
parties
men
and
women
where
people
live
and
whether
they
own
a
gun
while
democrats
and
independents
want
congress
to
pass
them
republicans
do
not
men
and
women
also
divide
here
of
women
are
in
favor
of
banning
assault-style
weapons
while
of
men
are
against
it
gun
owners
majorities
of
whom
support
congress
passing
legislation
to
increase
mental
health
funding
require
background
checks
institute
a
national
red
flag
law
and
require
licensing
before

it
comes
to
the
general
sentiment
around
guns
and
whether
it's
more
important
to
control

violence
or
protect

a
majority
of
americans
say
it's
more
important
to
control
gun
violence
to
that
margin
has
been
been
consistent
since

when
former
president
barack

declared
it

republicans
however
when
it
comes
to
mandatory

programs
of

which
they
