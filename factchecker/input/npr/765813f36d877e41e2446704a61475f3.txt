the
department
of
homeland
security
and
its
federal
emergency
management
agency
said
tuesday
they
will
move
million
in
funds
to
support
president
trump's
border
enforcement
efforts
the
department
of
homeland
security
said
it
will
transfer
the
emergency
funds
including
million
from
fema's
disaster
relief
fund
to
support
new
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
detention
beds
as
well
as
facilities
for
related
court
cases
according
to
documents
obtained
by
npr
in
a
july
notification
to
congress
about
the
transfer
dhs
said
the
million
comes
from
recoveries
of
prior-year
funds
and
that
absent
significant
new
catastrophic
events
the
department
believes
the
fund
will
still
have
enough
money
to
operate
congressional
democrats
slammed
the
move
which
came
at
the
peak
of
hurricane
season
and
as
tropical
storm
dorian
was
poised
to
reach
hurricane
levels
the
trump
administration's
plan
to
divert
money
away
from
fema
at
the
start
of
hurricane
season
to
continue
its
efforts
to
separate
and
jail
migrant
families
is
backwards
and
cruel
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
said
taking
these
critical
funds
from
disaster
preparedness
and
recovery
efforts
threatens
lives
and
weakens
the
government's
ability
to
help
americans
in
the
wake
of
natural
disasters
congress
appropriated
these
funds
to
meet
the
american
people's
priorities
and
i
strongly
oppose
this
effort
to
undermine
our
constitutional
authority
dhs
alerted
congress
to
the
move
in
a
page
notification
dated
july
which
nbc
first
reported
earlier
tuesday
the
agency
is
required
to
give
congress
a
day
notice
to
the
plans
democrats
opposed
to
the
move
waited
to
respond
until
the
end
of
that
notification
period
in
hopes
of
delaying
the
costly
action
a
congressional
source
familiar
with
the
plans
said
i
have
significant
concerns
about
the
intended
use
of
funds
and
consequently
about
the
trade-offs
between
that
use
and
activities
that
would
otherwise
be
funded
from
the
source
accounts
california
rep
lucille
roybal-allard
chair
of
a
house
appropriations
subcommittee
told
dhs
acting
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
in
an
aug
letter
roybal-allard
said
the
the
reprogramming
was
unnecessary
and
the
trump
administration
was
overstepping
its
authority
she
noted
that
dhs
components
such
as
the
u.s.
coast
guard
could
be
hampered
by
the
move
she
added
that
she
was
concerned
about
implementation
of
the
agency's
immigration
enforcement
operations
which
often
ignore
its
budget
directives
from
congress
and
lack
transparency
she
urged
mcaleenan
to
work
with
the
house
appropriations
committee
to
restore
their
partnership
i
am
greatly
concerned
that
during
the
course
of
this
administration
there
has
been
a
growing
disconnect
between
the
will
of
congress
as
represented
by
ice
funding
levels
in
enacted
appropriations
bills
signed
by
the
president
and
the
department's
immigration
enforcement
operations
which
often
lack
justification
roybal-allard
said
sen
jeff
merkley
d-ore
also
slammed
the
move
tuesday
once
again
this
administration
is
endangering
america
by
moving
funds
away
from
emergency
management
for
their
extremist
border
agenda
he
said
president
trump
and
his
administration
are
not
just
endangering
the
lives
of
the
children
and
families
they
seek
to
harm
in
the
name
of
deterrence
by
shortchanging
preparedness
they're
endangering
the
lives
of
millions
of
americans
who
live
in
hurricane
zones
as
well
the
dhs
notification
to
congress
expired
on
sunday
the
agency
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
the
department
also
defended
the
move
saying
it
is
necessary
to
deal
with
the
influx
of
migrants
given
the
rise
of
single
adults
crossing
the
border
ice
has
already
had
to
increase
the
number
of
detention
beds
above
what
congress
funded
dhs
said
in
its
statement
without
additional
funding
for
single
adult
detention
beds
and
transportation
from
the
u.s.
border
patrol
to
ice
detention
facilities
ice
will
not
be
able
to
support
the
influx
of
migrants
from
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
apprehensions
in
its
notification
dhs
cited
a
security
and
humanitarian
crisis
on
the
southern
border
and
the
high
volume
of
aliens
presenting
themselves
at
ports
of
entry
or
entering
illegally
and
being
released
into
the
interior
of
the
united
states
while
they
wait
sometimes
years
for
a
final
resolution
of
their
case
the
shift
in
the
funds
would
help
dhs
address
the
crisis
the
department
says
under
authority
provided
in
the
fiscal
year
dhs
appropriations
act
as
a
result
dhs
said
it
will
transfer
funds
from
its
fema
disaster
relief
fund
and
other
accounts
to
the
new
border
effort
in
a
statement
issued
by
a
fema
spokesman
wednesday
afternoon
the
agency
said
its
disaster
relief
fund
will
still
have
million
remaining
in
its
base
account
after
the
transfer
another
fema
account
used
for
ongoing
recovery
efforts
which
now
totals
billion
won't
be
impacted
by
the
plans
to
divert
money
to
the
southern
border
operations
the
agency
said
this
amount
will
be
sufficient
to
support
operational
needs
and
will
not
impact
ongoing
long
term
recovery
efforts
across
the
country
the
agency
said
of
the
overall
million
total
to
be
diverted
dhs
said
it
will
move
million
to
establish
and
operate
temporary
migrant
protection
protocol
immigration
hearing
facilities
along
the
southwest
border
an
additional
million
will
be
used
to
pay
for
new
detention
beds
the
agency
said
mpp
court
docket
backlogs
will
continue
to
grow
and
ice
will
not
be
able
to
effectively
and
efficiently
move
single
adult
migrants
between
detention
centers
and
courtrooms
without
the
funding
the
agency
said
this
realignment
of
resources
allows
dhs
to
address
ongoing
border
emergency
crisis
by
alleviating
the
surge
along
the
nation's
southwest
border
while
minimizing
the
risk
to
overall
dhs
mission
performance
supporters
of
the
administration's
immigration
policies
say
democrats
have
left
the
administration
little
choice
but
to
take
this
action
jessica
vaughan
director
of
policy
studies
for
the
center
for
immigration
studies
who
is
in
regular
discussions
with
the
administration
said
the
transfer
of
funds
is
necessary
because
ice
is
so
over
budget
from
the
border
crisis
it
has
to
find
the
money
from
somewhere
because
congress
hasn't
given
it
what
it
needs
she
said
ice's
priority
caseload
is
growing
but
the
democratic
majority
in
the
house
does
not
support
the
level
of
enforcement
that
they
consider
to
be
the
bare
minimum
for
public
safety
and
maintaining
the
most
basic
integrity
of
the
law
she
said
the
border
influx
has
strained
ice
capacity
she
said
under
the
law
their
detention
capacity
is
set
by
congress
they
have
to
balance
the
criminal
cases
border
cases
and
other
priorities
like
worksite
operations
and
fugitives
and
on
top
of
that
some
people
are
mandatory
to
be
detained
such
as
aggravated
felons
and
prior
deportees
