mike
pompeo
the
nation's
top
diplomat
took
to
the
sunday
news
talk
shows
to
defend
the
administration's
cancelling
of
a
secret
summit
between
the
leadership
of
the
taliban
and
the
president
of
afghanistan
the
meetings
had
been
set
to
take
place
at
camp
david
days
before
the
anniversary
of
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
in
an
appearance
on
fox
news
sunday
pompeo
the
u.s.
secretary
of
state
said
it
was
the
president's
idea
to
hold
the
talks
at
the
presidential
retreat
in
maryland
adding
it
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
place
to
do
so
president
trump
ultimately
made
the
decision
pompeo
said
adding
that
trump
wanted
to
look
both
the
president
of
afghanistan
ashraf
ghani
and
taliban
leaders
in
the
eye
to
determine
if
a
final
agreement
could
be
signed
off
on
so
we
found
that
arrangement
acceptable
that
the
verification
was
adequate
and
we
concluded
it
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
place
pompeo
said
it's
almost
always
the
case
that
you
don't
get
to
negotiate
with
good
guys
pompeo
also
confirmed
that
not
only
was
the
meeting
scrubbed
but
that
months-long
peace
negotiations
with
taliban
leadership
are
dead
for
now
and
the
lead
u.s.
negotiator
is
being
called
back
home
for
the
time
being
that
is
absolutely
the
case
pompeo
said
on
nbc's
meet
the
press
we've
recalled
ambassador
zalmay
khalilzad
back
to
washington
the
now-canceled
secret
meetings
at
camp
david
were
first
made
public
in
a
series
of
tweets
by
trump
saturday
evening
he
cited
the
recent
taliban
attack
where
a
dozen
people
were
killed
including
an
american
soldier
as
justification
for
scuttling
the
talks
unbeknownst
to
almost
everyone
the
major
taliban
leaders
and
separately
the
president
of
afghanistan
were
going
to
secretly
meet
with
me
at
camp
david
on
sunday
trump
tweeted
he
added
unfortunately
in
order
to
build
false
leverage
they
admitted
to
an
attack
in
kabul
that
killed
one
of
our
great
great
soldiers
and
other
people
i
immediately
cancelled
the
meeting
and
called
off
peace
negotiations
following
trump's
statements
on
twitter
a
series
of
taliban
statements
suggested
how
close
the
two
sides
had
come
to
announcing
an
agreement
and
the
way
it
would
have
played
out
suhail
shaheen
the
taliban
negotiations
spokesman
said
on
twitter
the
group
already
finalized
an
agreement
with
the
americans
a
few
days
ago
shaheen
says
the
gulf
state
of
qatar
which
has
been
hosting
the
talks
would
announce
the
agreement
trump's
cancellation
he
says
was
baffling
president
trump's
surprising
tweets
surprised
everybody
he
writes
certainly
he
has
harmed
his
credibility
in
a
longer
statement
the
taliban
said
they
had
been
invited
to
washington
in
august
to
meet
the
trump
but
they
delayed
it
until
the
agreement
was
ready
to
sign
the
insurgents
said
talks
with
other
afghans
on
the
future
of
their
country
were
set
to
begin
sept
cancelling
the
talks
the
taliban
said
was
a
bigger
loss
for
american
than
anybody
else
the
taliban
said
it
believes
the
united
states
would
ultimately
return
to
negotiations
in
an
interview
sunday
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
pompeo
said
trump
made
the
right
decision
to
walk
away
from
the
meetings
when
the
taliban
tried
to
gain
negotiating
advantage
by
conducting
terror
attacks
inside
of
the
country
president
trump
made
the
right
decision
to
say
that's
not
going
to
work
pompeo
said
it's
not
appropriate
the
taliban
killed
an
american
and
it
made
no
sense
for
the
taliban
to
be
rewarded
for
that
kind
of
bad
behavior
pompeo
also
reiterated
that
even
though
the
u.s.
was
engaged
in
talks
with
the
taliban
the
fight
on
the
battlefield
never
quit

pompeo
says
on

this
week
we
have
been
fighting
and
talking
in
a
way
that
america
often
doesn't
do
pompeo
stresses
he
hopes
negotiations
will
resume
at
some
point
but
says
actions
by
the
taliban
did
not
match
commitments
the
sides
were
working
toward
in
the
talks
but
we
finally
reached
a
point
where
we
were
close
we
had
made
real
progress
and
then
the
taliban
failed
to
live
up
to
a
series
of
commitments
that
they
had
made
pompeo
said
the
announcement
of
such
high
profile
talks
were
planned
between
a
sitting
president
and
leaders
of
an
insurgent
organization
on
u.s.
soil
is
astonishing
the
meeting
was
set
to
take
place
just
days
before
the
th
anniversary
of
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
the
attacks
were
carried
out
by
the
al-qaida
which
took
up
refuge
inside
afghanistan
and
was
provided
a
safe
haven
by
ruling
taliban
government
reporting
from
islamabad
npr
pentagon
correspondent
tom
bowman
said
on
npr's
weekend
edition
that
the
planned
meeting
was
highly
unusual
we
had
been
hearing
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
peace
deal
it
would
be
signed
likely
in
kabul
with
zalmay
khalilzad
being
there
possibly
president
ashraf
ghani
and
a
member
of
the
taliban
bowman
said
the
fact
that
they
planned
to
bring
it
to
u.s.
soil
is
highly
unusual
news
of
the
taliban's
planned
visit
to
the
u.s.
drew

calls

a
great
american
and
says
his
death
is
a
reminder
that
the
u.s.
has
got
to
the
peace
agreement
right
we've
got
to
protect
american
national
security
interests
so
that
terror
can
never
strike
again
from
afghanistan
at
the
same
time
reduce
america's
treasure
and
blood
and
that
we've
given
for
now
almost
two
