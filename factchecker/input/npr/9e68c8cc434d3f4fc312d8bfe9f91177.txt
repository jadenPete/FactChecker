the
energy
department
is
reversing
energy-efficiency
standards
for
lightbulbs
that
were
set
to
take
effect
next
year
the
trump
administration
is
rolling
back
requirements
for
new
energy-efficient
lightbulbs
the
energy
department
announced
the
move
on
wednesday
withdrawing
standards
that
were
to
be
put
in
place
to
make
commonly
used
bulbs
more
efficient
the
new
standards
were
included
in
energy
legislation
implemented
under
president
george
w.
bush
and
finalized
under
the
obama
administration
they
were
set
to
go
into
effect
in
january
and
gradually
phase
out
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
this
includes
the
everyday
pear-shaped
bulbs
as
well
as
bulbs
used
for
items
such
as
bathroom
vanities
recessed
lighting
and
candle-shape
lights
to
be
replaced
with
energy-efficient
led
versions
which
are
illuminated
by
light-emitting
diodes
in
its
announcement
of
the
rollback
the
energy
department
says
the
new
lightbulb
standards
were
established
in
in
a
manner
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
last
march
npr's
jeff
brady
reported
thanks
to
a
law
signed
by
president
george
w.
bush
shelves
these
days
are
largely
stocked
with
led
bulbs
that
look
more
like
the
traditional
pear-shape
incandescent
version
but
use
just
one-fifth
the
energy
a
second
wave
of
lightbulb
changes
was
set
to
happen
but
now
the
trump
administration
wants
to
undo
an
obama-era
regulation
designed
to
make
a
wide
array
of
specialty
lightbulbs
more
energy-efficient
critics
of
the
reversal
say
it
will
mean
higher
energy
bills
and
more
pollution
the
rollback
will
eliminate
energy-efficient
standards
for
lightbulbs
that
were
slated
to
take
effect
in
january
that
would
save
consumers
billions
of
dollars
and
reduce
millions
of
tons
of
climate
change
carbon
dioxide
emissions
says
andrew
delaski
executive
director
of
the
appliance
standards
awareness
project
the
trump
administration
is
trying
to
protect
technology
that
was
first
invented
in
the
s
it's
like
trying
to
protect
the
horse
and
buggy
from
the
automobile
technology
it
makes
no
sense
to
go
back
to
technology
from
two
centuries
ago
when
we
have
new
technology
today
which
saves
consumers
money
and
helps
protect
the
environment
by
reducing
the
amount
of
power
that
we
need
delaski
said
according
to
the
natural
resources
defense
council
the
affected
bulbs
account
for
billions
of
light
sockets
that
are
currently
in
use
in
the
u.s.
the
rollback
will
lead
to
higher
energy
bills
for
homes
and
businesses
plus
significantly
more
pollution
harming
our
health
and
the
environment
due
to
all
the
extra
electricity
that
will
need
to
be
generated
the
nrdc
said
in
a
statement
some
companies
that
manufacture
lightbulbs
opposed
the
expansion
to
higher
standards
of
energy
efficiency
delaski
says
every
time
a
consumer
shifts
to
an
led
that
lightbulb
is
going
to
last
years
or
longer
so
the
lightbulb
manufacturers
are
trying
to
save
technology
that
keeps
the
consumer
coming
back
to
buy
another
bulb
every
year
but
still
wastes
a
lot
of
energy
the
rollback
is
likely
to
face
legal
challenges
from
environmental
groups
which
said
they
would
sue
if
the
standards
were
reversed
