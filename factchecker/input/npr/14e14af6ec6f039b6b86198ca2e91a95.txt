attorneys
for
virginia's
democratic
lieutenant
governor
justin
fairfax
filed
a
million
defamation
lawsuit
against
cbs
on
thursday
accusing
the
network
of
amplifying
sexual
assault
claims
that
fairfax
says
are
false
defamatory
and
politically-motivated
the
lawsuit
centers
on
cbs
this
morning's
airing
of
two
interviews
with
meredith
watson
and
vanessa
tyson
who
in
february
accused
fairfax
of
separate
incidents
of
sexual
assault
fairfax's
attorneys
allege
the
network
didn't
fully
vet
the
accusers
claims
and
omitted
information
that
would
exonerate
him
the
suit
repeats
fairfax's
claims
that
the
women
unambiguously
expressed
their
consent
the
suit
also
alleges
that
a
cbs
lawyer
who
knew
fairfax
from
college
knew
the
encounter
with
watson
was
consensual
because
he
was
told
about
it
by
an
eyewitness
in
a
statement
cbs
news
said
we
stand
by
our
reporting
and
we
will
vigorously
defend
this
lawsuit
tyson's
attorneys
debra
katz
and
lisa
banks
called
the
lawsuit
yet
another
desperate
stunt
by
mr
fairfax
to
preserve
his
political
career
at
the
expense
of
survivors
of
sexual
assault
nancy
erika
smith
an
attorney
for
watson
said
in
a
statement
that
we
look
forward
to
everyone
testifying
under
oath
now
that
this
matter
is
in
court
watson
says
fairfax
raped
her
in
while
they
were
students
at
duke
university
tyson
said
fairfax
forced
her
to
perform
oral
sex
during
an
encounter
in
a
boston
hotel
room
at
the
democratic
national
convention
the
women
told
their
stories
in
tearful
interviews
with
gayle
king
that
aired
april
and
april
watson
and
tyson
have
asked
that
virginia's
general
assembly
hold
bipartisan
hearings
into
their
accounts
democrats
have
so
far
blocked
republican
efforts
to
do
that
saying
the
body
isn't
equipped
to
handle
proceedings
the
allegations
came
forward
days
after
a
racist
yearbook
photo
surfaced
on
democratic
gov
ralph
northam's
medical
school
yearbook
page
that
revelation
and
the
governor's
bungled
response
led
to
calls
for
northam's
resignation
seemingly
creating
an
opening
for
fairfax
to
assume
the
top
post
instead
northam
withstood
the
calls
to
step
down
as
tyson
and
then
watson
came
forward
with
their
stories
proof
fairfax
says
of
an
orchestrated
campaign
against
him
the
complaint
says
that
effort
is
led
by
supporters
of
richmond
mayor
levar
stoney
who
fairfax
claims
threatened
to
blackmail
him
last
year
by
publicly
releasing
the
tyson
allegations
stoney
spokesman
jim
nolan
called
the
claims
untrue
and
offensive
the
suit
seeks
damages
caused
by
the
intentional
and
reckless
publishing
and
propagation
by
cbs
of
patently
false
allegations
the
complaint
notes
that
fairfax
lost
his
job
with
a
prestigious
law
firm
at
which
he
would
have
earned
millions
of
dollars
over
the
years
university
of
richmond
law
professor
carl
tobias
said
courts
have
set
high
bars
for
defamation
cases
out
of
deference
to
the
first
amendment
fairfax's
attorneys
will
have
to
prove
cbs
acted
out
of
malice
there
are
allegations
to
that
effect
but
they
may
be
difficult
to
prove
tobias
said
the
suit
elaborates
on
some
of
fairfax's
past
defenses
it
says
fairfax's
encounter
with
watson
occurred
in
the
room
of
a
fraternity
brother
who
he
claims
was
present
throughout
the
encounter
and
observed
an
entirely
consensual
encounter
the
eyewitness
repeated
that
claim
with
friends
after
it
occurred
according
to
the
complaint
one
of
those
friends
today
is
a
cbs
attorney
he
was
a
fraternity
brother
of
fairfax's
and
the
eyewitness
at
duke
according
to
the
suit
and
previously
dated
watson
the
complaint
which
does
not
name
the
attorney
says
the
lawyer
knew
about
the
eyewitness's
story
but
was
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
stop
the
king
interviews
from
airing
the
network
failed
to
interview
other
individuals
who
may
have
been
able
to
confirm
or
contradict
the
allegations
according
to
the
complaint
the
suit
also
reiterates
fairfax's
claims
that
tyson
contacted
him
after
their
encounter
and
never
mentioned
the
assault
in
public
appearances
tyson
who
is
an
associate
professor
of
politics
at
scripps
college
in
california
has
said
the
alleged
assault
caused
humiliation
that
she
struggled
to
overcome
i
like
most
survivors
suppressed
those
memories
and
emotions
as
a
necessary
means
to
continue
my
studies
and
to
pursue
my
goal
of
building
a
successful
career
as
an
academic

in
a
statement
