andrew
yang
at
a
campaign
event
at
a
public
library
in
plaistow
n.h.
last
week
andrew
yang
is
running
for
president
with
a
message
that
automation
and
artificial
intelligence
have
already
destroyed
millions
of
american
jobs
will
destroy
millions
more
and
there's
little
anyone
can
do
to
stop
it
he
says
climate
change
is
much
worse
than
even
the
most
pessimistic
projections
and
yet
in
an
interview
with
the
npr
politics
podcast
and
new
hampshire
public
radio
the
year-old
serial
entrepreneur
says
he
is
an
optimist
i'm
not
someone
holed
up
in
my
basement
waiting
for
the
waters
to
overtake
me
yang
said
i'm
trying
to
fight
it
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
and
that
to
me
speaks
to
my
sense
of
the
possibilities
still
in
front
of
us
yang
drew
a
packed
crowd
to
a
public
library
in
a
small
town
in
southern
new
hampshire
on
friday
night
a
diverse
group
in
terms
of
age
race
and
gender
some
were
curious
voters
trying
to
see
as
many
candidates
as
they
could
some
were
part
of
the
yang
gang
shorthand
for
those
all-in
on
andrew
yang's
candidacy
for
someone
who
has
no
history
in
politics
and
was
largely
unknown
until
he
launched
his
presidential
campaign
yang
was
greeted
with
a
rock
star
reception
and
unlike
some
governors
and
members
of
congress
yang
has
already
qualified
for
the
fall
debate
stage
yang's
answer
to
his
doom
and
gloom
descriptions
of
the
economy
and
many
other
problems
is
a
universal
basic
income
proposal
he's
calling
the
freedom
dividend
a
month
to
every
u.s.
citizen
years
and
older
donald
trump
is
our
president
today
in
large
part
because
he
got
some
of
the
problems
right
but
his
solutions
are
the
opposite
of
what
we
need
his
solutions
were
we're
going
to
build
a
wall
we're
going
to
turn
the
clock
back
we're
going
to
bring
the
old
jobs
back
yang
said
we
have
to
do
the
opposite
of
all
that
we
have
to
turn
the
clock
forward
we
have
to
accelerate
our
economy
and
society
as
fast
as
possible
we
have
to
evolve
in
the
way
we
see
work
and
value
on
attracting
donald
trump
voters
i
talk
a
lot
about
the
problems
in
people's
communities
that
they
can
recognize
and
to
me
it's
a
mystery
why
other
democrats
aren't
focused
on
the
same
problems
when
i
grew
up
i
thought
of
the
democrats
as
the
party
of
the
working
class
the
party
of
the
little
guy
or
gal
and
to
me
who
are
the
little
guys
and
gals
in
our
economy
today
it
is
the
retail
clerk
the
fast
food
worker
the
truck
driver
the
call
center
worker
the
people
who
feel
like
their
futures
are
being
pushed
more
and
more
to
the
side
i
think
that
many
people
who
voted
for
donald
trump
felt
like
the
democratic
party
was
not
speaking
to
them
and
the
problems
they
saw
in
their
communities
and
i
am
so
that's
winning
me
a
critical
mass
of
donald
trump
supporters
which
is
to
me
crucial
for
the
democratic
nominee
the
whole
point
is
to
beat
donald
trump
on
reclaiming
an
asian
stereotype
it
was
something
a
supporter
said
to
me
initially
he
said
you're
the
opposite
of
donald
trump
you're
an
asian
man
who
likes
math
and
i
thought
oh
that's
actually
pretty
clever
and
so
then
i
used
it
at
the
next
event
and
it
got
raucous
applause
and
laughter
and
then
said
ok
not
being
a
total
idiot
i
should
probably
say
that
again
and
in
my
case
i
am
an
asian
man
who
likes
math
i
think
most
americans
are
savvy
enough
to
know
that
that's
not
true
of
every
asian
person
but
it
does
to
me
reclaim
a
stereotype
that
happens
to
be
true
in
my
case
on
climate
change
as
an
existential
threat
to
our
way
of
life
most
politicians
will
say
we
can
do
it
we
can
beat
it
i
just
told
the
truth
at
the
second
democratic
debate
which
is
that
we're
only
of
the
world's
emissions
even
if
we
were
to
go
zero
carbon
the
earth
would
continue
to
warm
in
all
likelihood
because
of
the
energy
composition
of
other
countries
now
i
take
climate
change
very
very
seriously
it's
an
existential
threat
to
our
way
of
life
apparently
i
might
take
it
more
seriously
than
even
some
other
people
who
believe
it's
serious
because
i
think
it's
worse
than
anyone
thinks
so
i
think
we
should
move
toward
renewable
energy
sources
as
fast
as
possible
but
also
proactively
try
and
mitigate
the
worst
effects
and
even
try
and
restore
our
habitat
in
various
ways
by
reforesting
tracts
of
land
and
reseeding
the
ocean
with
kelp
marine
permaculture
arrays
and
things
that
can
help
rehabilitate
what
we've
done
because
right
now
the
atlantic
ocean
is
losing
to
of
its
biomass
every
year
then
you
can
do
the
math
on
that
it's
a
catastrophe
in
the
making
on
whether
he's
an
optimist
or
a
pessimist
i've
started
several
multimillion-dollar
organizations
i'm
running
for
president
and
i'm
currently
either
in
fifth
or
sixth
place
depending
upon
where
you
look
you
don't
do
any
of
those
things
if
you're
not
an
optimist
i
believe
we
can
arrest
the
decline
of
our
civilization
i
believe
we
can
evolve
in
the
way
we
think
about
work
and
value
i
think
we
can
give
every
american
a
freedom
dividend
of
if
a
majority
of
us
get
together
and
say
that's
what
we
want
to
do
i'd
say
these
are
profoundly
optimistic
decisions
and
actions
i'm
not
someone
holed
up
in
my
basement
waiting
for
the
waters
to
overtake
me
i'm
trying
to
fight
it
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
and
that
to
me
speaks
to
my
sense
of
the
possibilities
still
in
front
of
us
i'm
a
parent
i've
got
two
young
boys
and
i'll
be
damned
if
i
just
rest
while
the
future
i
see
coming
up
just
overtakes
us
all
on
being
intimate
with
defeat
i
have
failed
so
many
times
in
my
life
from
when
i
was
young
to
now
i
mean
just
so
many
humiliating
defeats
i
mean
the
ones
that
you
think
of
as
most
significant
is
my
first
company
totally
flopped
and
if
you
start
a
company
you
have
to
tell
everyone
you
know
you're
doing
it
so
then
everyone
knows
it
flopped
there's
no
hiding
it
there's
no
like
oh
it
went
ok
it's
like
no
everyone
knows
when
i
was
young
i
tried
out
for
soccer
team
didn't
make
it
basketball
team
didn't
make
it
school
play
didn't
make
it
like
i
was
constantly
getting
cut
losing
whatever
it
was
certainly
my
profile
was
not
like
oh
you
know
star
of
the
high
school
play
student
body
president
that
was
not
the
profile
so
i
feel
like
i'm
very
intimate
with
defeat
and
i
think
it's
actually
good
training
as
an
entrepreneur
because
one
of
the
things
we're
doing
with
our
young
people
is
we're
treating
them
to
fear
failure
let's
say
you're
a
salesperson
if
you
can
sell
of
the
time
then
you're
actually
doing
great
even
now
when
i
talk
to
new
hampshire
voters
if
i
talk
to
a
group
of
voters
i
don't
expect
of
them
to
be
like
yeah
