down
on

a
perfectly
fine
and
routine
conversation
where
nothing
was
said
that

in
any
way
wrong
as
npr
reported
friday
president
trump
dismissed
the
whistleblower
allegations
as
a
political
hackjob
the

street
journal
reported
on
friday
that
trump
repeatedly
pressured
the
ukrainian
leader
about
eight
times
to
work
with
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
on
a
probe
of
hunter
biden
the
washington

reported
that
the

also
included
an
unspecified
promise
made
by

trump
a
little
more
than
two
weeks
after
that
conversation
on
aug
the
acting
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
michael
atkinson
said
his
office
received
a
disclosure
involving
an
alleged
urgent
concern
the
trump
administration
has
so
far
ignored
calls
to
release
the
contents
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
even
though
congressional
democrats
say
they
are
legally
entitled
to
the
information
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
said
in
a
statement
friday
that
congress
must
be
sure
the
administration
is
engaging
in
national
security
and
foreign
policy
that's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
american
people
the
administration's
blocking
of
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
from
providing
congress
with
the
whistleblower
complaint
violates
the
federal
statute
which
unequivocally
states
that
the
dni
shall
provide
congress
this
information
pelosi
said
trump
on
saturday
accused
the
media
and
democrats
of
trying
to
protect
the
democratic
front-runner
he
even
gave
the
controversy
a
new
moniker
the
ukraine
witch
hunt
