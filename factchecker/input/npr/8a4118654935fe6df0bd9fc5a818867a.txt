with
a
growing
number
of
imports
from
china
facing
tariffs
some
companies
are
trying
to
avoid
those
costs
by
falsely
labeling
chinese
products
as
manufactured
elsewhere
the
search
for
the
origin
of
the
pencils
led
to
a
dusty
factory
in
the
philippines
an
american
investigator
traveled
there
last
year
trying
to
find
out
if
the
factory
really
produced
the
pencils
as
a
u.s.
importer
claimed
or
was
simply
repackaging
pencils
from
china
as
a
competitor
suspected
chinese
pencils
have
long
been
subject
to
a
stiff
anti-dumping
tariff
which
would
have
more
than
doubled
the
importer's
cost
an
unannounced
factory
visit
yielded
damning
evidence
according
to
a
u.s.
customs
report
the
manufacturing
equipment
at
the
philippine
plant
appeared
to
have
been
covered
in
dust
and
cobwebs
indicating
that
they
had
not
been
used
for
some
time
the
inspector
saw
no
evidence
of
manufacturing
though
some
pencils
were
being
sharpened
and
there
were
boxes
and
boxes
of
finished
pencils
with
labels
saying
they
were
made
in
china
the
inspector
witnessed
staff
repacking
what
appeared
to
be
chinese
origin
products
into
boxes
labeled
made
in
philippines
the
report
said
mislabeling
the
source
of
products
to
avoid
tariffs
is
not
a
new
scam
but
it's
likely
to
grow
more
prevalent
as
the
trade
war
between
the
u.s.
and
china
drags
on
and
tariffs
are
extended
to
nearly
everything
china
exports
each
new
brick
in
the
president's
tariff
wall
brings
new
incentives
for
unscrupulous
businesspeople
to
tunnel
under
customs
officials
say
plenty
of
suppliers
in
china
are
willing
to
help
customers
avoid
those
tariffs
by
falsely
claiming
their
products
are
manufactured
elsewhere
sometimes
the
goods
are
actually
shipped
to
that
third
country
on
their
way
to
the
u.s.
to
add
a
veneer
of
legitimacy
it's
no
secret
it's
definitely
an
open
cottage
industry
in
china
big
time
said
a
spokesman
for
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
tariff
enforcement
policy
it's
not
uncommon
to
hear
stories
of
chinese
brokers
charging
a
nominal
extra
fee
to
somebody
to
essentially
say
don't
worry
about
it
i'll
make
sure
it
doesn't
say
china
on
it
roberto
durazo
helps
set
up
factories
in
mexico
lately
he
has
been
getting
a
lot
of
calls
from
chinese
companies
eager
to
avoid
the
mounting
import
taxes
imposed
by
the
trump
administration
they
tell
us
like
hey
i
build
a
tv
durazo
said
and
i
want
that
tv
to
be
made
in
mexico
so
i
don't
have
to
pay
the
duties
durazo
is
happy
to
help
firms
that
actually
want
to
relocate
their
manufacturing
to
mexico
but
some
don't
want
to
go
that
far
they
want
to
keep
making
tvs
and
other
products
in
china
but
pass
them
off
as
made
in
mexico
to
avoid
paying
the
tariffs
they
just
want
to
put
it
in
the
box
add
labels
and
claim
that
it's
made
in
mexico
durazo
said
and
we
tell
them
it
doesn't
work
like
that
sometimes
however
it
does
work
like
that
because
not
everyone
is
as
honest
as
durazo
is
attorney
benjamin
bucy
says
he's
seeing
more
of
these
cases
as
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
mount
bucy
co-authored
a
law
review
article
last
year
called
trade
fraud
the
wild
new
frontier
of
white
collar
crime
often
he
says
it's
up
to
competitors
to
blow
the
whistle
if
they're
paying
a
tariff
and
being
undercut
by
someone
where
they
know
the
export
price
and
the
tariff
price
in
something
isn't
matching
up
that's
often
the
kind
of
knowledge
that
a
competitor
uses
to
build
a
case
bucy
said
the
search
of
the
philippine
factory
last
year
began
when
dixon
ticonderoga
filed
a
complaint
with
customs
and
border
protection
about
one
of
its
competitors
royal
brush
manufacturing
dixon
ticonderoga
suspected
that
royal
brush
was
buying
cheap
chinese
pencils
but
claiming
they
were
made
in
the
philippines
to
avoid
paying
the
anti-dumping
tariff
of
after
a
month
investigation
customs
agreed
and
royal
brush
was
ordered
to
repay
the
avoided
tariffs
the
company
is
appealing
the
customs
ruling
and
has
stopped
doing
business
with
its
philippine
supplier
this
has
been
a
costly
time-consuming
really
psychologically
painful
process
said
ronald
oleynik
royal
brush's
lawyer
they're
struggling
to
clear
their
name
oleynik
conceded
that
his
client
may
have
been
duped
along
with
everyone
else
about
the
origin
of
the
pencils
it's
hard
to
know
for
certain
when
a
supplier's
factory
is
an
ocean
away
the
trump
administration
i
keep
saying
doesn't
have
a
trade
war
it's
in
some
ways
got
a
war
on
trade
oleynik
said
bucy
who
often
represents
companies
bringing
complaints
about
tariff
evasion
argues
that
whatever
one
thinks
of
the
president's
trade
war
scofflaws
should
be
pursued
once
those
laws
are
passed
and
law-abiding
importers
or
others
are
subject
to
paying
those
then
those
laws
need
to
be
enforced
he
said
foreign
suppliers
often
make
little
effort
to
cover
their
tracks
customs
officials
say
that
in
some
cases
they
find
only
a
vacant
lot
where
a
factory
is
supposed
to
be
these
unscrupulous
actors
in
some
of
these
foreign
countries
are
not
used
to
scrutiny
bucy
said
they're
not
expecting
to
be
investigated
at
all
nevertheless
customs
officials
say
vetting
the
growing
number
of
complaints
is
a
challenge
when
the
u.s.
imposes
tariffs
on
china
it's
only
natural
that
some
production
really
does
move
to
other
countries
customs
investigators
grow
suspicious
when
they
see
what
appear
to
be
abrupt
moves
especially
those
that
involve
complex
manufacturing
or
heavy
machinery
if
on
monday
a
company
is
sourcing
all
their
product
from
china
and
on
tuesday
all
of
it
is
suddenly
now
coming
from
vietnam
or
some
other
country
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
commodity
that's
just
not
realistic
the
customs
spokesman
said
if
that
abrupt
shift
occurs
the
day
after
chinese
tariffs
are
raised
that's
another
indicator
u.s.
imports
from
vietnam
jumped
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
compared
with
the
same
period
a
year
ago
policing
tariff
fraud
in
far-flung
places
is
expensive
and
even
when
the
customs
cops
succeed
in
shutting
down
one
fraudulent
factory
another
pops
up
to
take
its
place
much
like
a
game
of
whack-a-mole
there
are
no
strong
consequences
at
least
in
their
home
country
said
university
of
north
carolina
economist
patrick
conway
who
has
followed
tariff
enforcement
for
decades
it
is
difficult
to
have
a
long-term
impact
even
if
you
find
evidence
of
an
almost
open-and-shut
case
