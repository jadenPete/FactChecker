the
federal
election
commission
will
be
effectively
prevented
from
doing
much
of
its
work
at
the
end
of
august
after
it
loses
a
quorum
of
its
commissioners
barring
some
kind
of
miraculous
last-minute
reprieve
friday
will
be
the
last
business
day
that
the
federal
election
commission
will
be
able
to
function
for
quite
a
while
leaving
the
enforcement
of
federal
campaign
finance
laws
unattended
ahead
of
the
election
the
commission's
vice
chairman
matthew
petersen
announced
his
resignation
earlier
this
week
to
take
effect
at
the
end
of
the
month
with
petersen
gone
the
fec
will
be
down
to
three
members
and
won't
have
a
quorum
in
addition
to
collecting
campaign
finance
data
the
fec
investigates
potential
campaign
finance
violations
issues
fines
and
gives
guidance
to
campaigns
about
following
election
law
but
not
without
a
working
quorum
of
at
least
four
commissioners
to
not
have
the
fec
able
to
take
action
right
now
is
deeply
concerning
says
daniel
weiner
a
former
senior
counsel
at
the
fec
who's
now
with
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
new
york
university
law
school
in
particular
weiner
is
concerned
about
another
attempt
by
russia
or
other
actors
to
interfere
in
the
election
after
it's
become
very
clear
that
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
russian
government
and
potentially
other
u.s.
rivals
will
seek
to
interfere
in
the
u.s.
election
including
through
online
propaganda
cybersecurity
incursions
and
other
tactics
weiner
told
npr
as
the
regulator
for
campaign
spending
he
describes
the
fec
as
one
of
the
front-line
agencies
combating
foreign
interference
the
fec
has
been
in
the
midst
of
strengthening
disclosure
and
transparency
requirements
for
online
political
ads
of
the
sort
that
russian
operatives
used
to
manipulate
voters
in
the
lack
of
a
quorum
weiner
says
will
make
that
impossible
until
that
seat
is
filled
it's
not
clear
how
long
the
fec
will
be
effectively
shut
down
president
trump
nominated
republican
trey
trainor
to
serve
on
the
commission
but
the
senate
has
not
yet
acted
on
the
nomination
in
the
past
nominees
have
been
paired
with
one
from
each
party
congressional
democrats
have
yet
to
announce
any
nominees
from
their
party
former
fec
chair
michael
toner
says
he
fears
there
is
a
real
possibility
the
fec
could
lack
a
quorum
through
the
election
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
agency
will
completely
go
dark
public
disclosure
reports
will
continue
to
be
due
and
will
need
to
be
filed
by
campaigns
and
pacs
and
committees
and
those
reports
will
be
reviewed
by
the
fec
staff
just
as
they
always
are
so
that's
important
said
toner
similarly
the
agency's
popular
website
will
continue
to
operate
allowing
people
to
get
information
on
campaign
fundraising
and
spending
toner
argues
the
agency's
inability
to
act
without
four
commissioners
won't
mean
that
campaign
finance
will
become
a
legal
free
zone
there's
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations
on
campaign
finance
violations
and
fec
complaints
can
still
be
filed
with
the
agency
at
some
point
presumably
the
agency
will
regain
a
quorum
said
toner
and
will
be
able
take
action
on
enforcement
cases
so
campaigns
and
committees
still
have
to
follow
the
law
but
meredith
mcgehee
executive
director
of
issue
one
a
campaign
reform
group
isn't
so
sure
they
will
it's
kind
of
like
saying
there's
a
law
against
robbing
banks
she
said
ninety-nine
point
nine
percent
of
the
population
will
still
not
rob
a
bank
if
there
wasn't
a
policeman
but
there's
always
that
element
there
that's
going
to
be
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
get
away
with
it
and
i
think
what's
really
different
about
politics
is
that
there's
both
so
much
gray
area
and
there
is
political
disagreement
about
the
laws
anyway
the
fec
is
not
the
only
government
agency
unable
to
act
because
of
a
lack
of
a
quorum
the
merit
systems
protection
board
which
investigates
allegations
of
violations
of
federal
personnel
practices
including
the
hatch
act
hasn't
had
one
for
over
two
years
