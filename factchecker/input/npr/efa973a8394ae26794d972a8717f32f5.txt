president
trump's
depiction
of
urban
life
in
america
is
often
grim
and
the
tension
between
the
president
and
big
city
mayors
is
often
filled
with
name-calling
and
lawsuits
for
many
mayors
who
end
up
in
the
president's
crosshairs
it's
a
balancing
act
as
they
try
to
determine
how
to
ward
off
criticism
as
well
as
trump
administration
policies
they
think
may
be
harmful
while
not
jeopardizing
federal
funds
earmarked
for
city
projects
for
example
trump
raised
plenty
of
hackles
with
his
recent
comments
about
the
homeless
in
california
hurting
the
prestige
of
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
darrell
steinberg
chairperson
of
california's
state
commission
on
homelessness
and
supportive
housing
calls
the
president's
statements
hypocritical
this
is
a
president
who
is
calling
for
the
elimination
of
the
community
development
block
grant
program
which
is
a
primary
source
of
funding
for
affordable
housing
says
steinberg
who
is
also
the
mayor
of
sacramento
last
week
steinberg
signed
a
letter
on
behalf
of
california's
big
cities
along
with
california
gov
gavin
newsom
it
asked
the
president
to
increase
housing
vouchers
by
the
thousands
for
the
state's
low-income
residents
steinberg
says
it's
time
for
any
adversarial
relationship
between
cities
and
the
trump
administration
to
end
when
it
comes
to
homelessness
there's
only
one
thing
that
matters
and
that
is
bringing
as
many
people
under
a
roof
as
possible
and
helping
them
reclaim
their
lives
steinberg
says
however
the
trump
administration
rejected
california's
request
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
ben
carson
wrote
back
saying
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
its
part
homelessness
though
is
just
one
issue
where
the
president
has
been
on
the
attack
he
has
disparaged
big
cities
led
by
democrats
for
a
variety
of
other
problems
recently
he
blasted
baltimore
for
its
economic
and
crime
problems
he
has
been
particularly
harsh
in
condemning
sanctuary
cities
for
putting
limits
on
cooperating
with
ice
the
country's
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
trump
tried
to
block
some
of
those
cities
including
chicago
from
receiving
justice
department
funds
often
used
to
hire
police
officers
and
obtain
services
that
law
enforcement
could
not
otherwise
afford
he
lost
that
battle
in
court
chicago
mayor
lori
lightfoot
says
that
obviously
the
city
needs
help
from
the
federal
government
but
we
are
not
going
to
compromise
our
values
in
pursuit
of
federal
dollars
lightfoot
says
the
president
loses
nothing
by
attacking
cities
because
he's
not
going
to
get
any
votes
of
large
urban
centers
like
the
city
of
chicago
some
but
nothing
that's
actually
going
to
profit
him
in
albuquerque
n.m.
federal
money
helped
fund
a
bus
expansion
program
mayor
tim
keller
says
the
city
appreciates
federal
funds
but
that
they
make
up
only
a
small
percentage
of
albuquerque's
nearly
billion
budget
we're
talking
about
less
than
of
our
budget
so
we're
not
worried
about
that
funding
keller
says
because
the
city
can
get
those
dollars
elsewhere
but
also
we
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
and
that's
why
we've
joined
the
lawsuits
with
the
u.s.
conference
of
mayors
to
resist
against
the
president
trying
to
leverage
funding
for
equipment
for
our
law
enforcement
folks
in
exchange
for
immigration
policy
while
the
relationship
between
trump
and
some
big
cities
remains
adversarial
bryan
barnett
the
head
of
the
u.s.
conference
of
mayors
and
also
mayor
of
rochester
hills
mich
says
the
goal
is
to
actually
be
partners
with
the
president
our
first
posture
is
always
to
collaborate
and
work
together
and
find
a
shared
success
barnett
says
but
if
need
be
we
will
make
sure
our
voices
are
heard
and
that
we
represent
the
people
who
live
in
our
cities
no
rapprochement
is
likely
anytime
soon
more
than
two
dozen
cities
and
states
are
joining
california
and
suing
the
trump
administration
over
rolling
back
emission
standards
