president
trump
arrives
at
joint
base
andrews
in
maryland
on
thursday
aboard
air
force
one
well
that
escalated
quickly
at
the
beginning
of
this
week
it
wasn't
at
all
clear
that
the
country
was
heading
toward
another
impeachment
investigation
years
after
republicans
filed
articles
of
impeachment
against
democratic
president
bill
clinton
but
by
the
end
of
this
week
that's
exactly
what
was
happening
democrats
launched
an
impeachment
inquiry
against
president
trump
after
the
release
of
an
official
transcript
of
a
call
between
trump
and
the
president
of
ukraine
and
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
detailed
allegations
of
a
pressure
campaign
from
trump
and
his
allies
toward
ukraine
to
help
investigate
joe
biden
here
are
eight
things
that
have
become
clear
in
this
murky
story
and
where
politically
this
all
might
be
heading
the
president
of
the
united
states
solicited
help
from
a
foreign
country
to
investigate
a
potential
political
rival
while
withholding
military
aid
to
that
country
if
that
sounds
like
a
jaw-dropping
bombshell
that's
because
it
is
i
would
like
you
to
do
us
a
favor
though
president
trump
told
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
according
to
the
official
white
house
account
of
the
call
between
trump
and
zelenskiy
in
july
that
ask
came
after
zelenskiy
thanked
trump
for
u.s.
military
support
and
said
he'd
like
to
buy
more
the
favor
investigate
a
debunked
conspiracy
theory
that
russia
wasn't
really
behind
the
hack
of
the
democratic
national
committee
and
the
other
thing
trump
said
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
trump
urged
zelenskiy
to
work
with
attorney
general
bill
barr
and
his
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
on
an
investigation
into
the
biden
family
zelenskiy
agreed
and
said
he
is
appointing
a
new
prosecutor
who
will
be
my
person
and
he
or
she
will
look
into
the
situation
a
week
before
the
call
trump
admits
he
held
up
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
already
allocated
by
congress
trump
changed
his
reasoning
for
why
he
delayed
the
aid
from
corruption
in
ukraine
to
wanting
european
countries
to
pay
more
trump
and
republicans
defend
the
call
saying
there
was
no
explicit
quid
pro
quo
democrats
note
that
is
beside
the
point
as
it
relates
to
impeachment
ukraine
is
largely
dependent
on
the
united
states
for
aid
and
support
as
it
faces
a
continued
threat
from
neighboring
russia
one
question
raised
by
all
of
this
why
was
aid
really
held
up
and
are
there
emails
or
communications
illuminating
the
reasoning
trump
and
the
white
house
are
already
trying
to
discredit
the
whistleblower
expect
more
of
that
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
is
not
known
to
the
public
but
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
said
the
whistleblower
and
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
acted
in
good
faith
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
done
everything
by
the
book
and
followed
the
law
he
said
in
a
congressional
hearing
thursday
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
that's
important
to
keep
in
mind
as
trump
and
those
backing
him
aim
to
discredit
the
whistleblower
trump
tweeted
friday
that
the
whistleblower
who
went
through
official
channels
is
sounding
more
and
more
like
he
or
she
isn't
a
whistleblower
at
all
talking
to
u.s.
diplomatic
officials
in
new
york
trump
equated
the
people
who
talked
to
the
whistleblower
as
almost
a
spy
and
then
said
you
know
what
we
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
smart
right
the
spies
and
treason
we
used
to
handle
it
a
little
differently
than
we
do
now
the
whistleblower
complaint
raises
a
lot
more
questions
democrats
might
dig
into
trump
and
republicans
are
right
when
they
say
the
whistleblower
is
giving
a
secondhand
account
the
individual
said
so
in
the
complaint
but
the
person
gathered
lots
of
information
talked
to
numerous
people
who
were
on
the
call
and
the
inspector
general
said
the
complaint
is
credible
here
are
some
of
the
questions
the
complaint
raises
that
may
well
become
part
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
was
the
white
house
account
of
the
call
compiled
from
contemporaneous
notes
of
those
in
the
room
or
on
the
call
removed
from
the
computer
system
where
transcripts
are
typically
stored
to
one
normally
used
to
store
and
handle
classified
information
of
an
especially
sensitive
nature
as
the
whistleblower
alleges
if
true
why
was
that
done
if
as
the
whistleblower
notes
the
call
did
not
contain
anything
remotely
sensitive
from
a
national
security
perspective
has
the
white
house
attempted
to
lock
down
other
calls
or
interactions
that
might
be
deemed
politically
problematic
for
trump
and
will
those
come
to
light
or
be
released
either
through
official
means
or
leaks
from
others
concerned
in
the
intelligence
community
what
is
the
depth
of
rudy
giuliani's
involvement
and
did
the
state
department
help
the
president's
personal
attorney
in
setting
up
a
meeting
with
the
ukrainians
to
pressure
them
to
begin
an
investigation
of
the
bidens
why
was
the
u.s.
ambassador
to
ukraine
really
removed
democrats
are
likely
to
look
into
at
least
some
of
these
questions
in
fact
on
friday
as
part
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
democrats
subpoenaed
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
for
documents
related
to
ukraine
the
house
intelligence
committee
will
hold
a
closed
briefing
with
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
next
friday
and
the
whistleblower
could
testify
as
soon
as
next
week
something
three-quarters
of
americans
said
they
want
to
see
happen
according
to
the
latest
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
support
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
has
gone
up
that
npr
poll
found
that
of
americans
are
now
in
favor
of
moving
forward
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
in
april
said
the
mueller
report
should
lead
to
impeachment
hearings
a
politico
morning
consult
poll
out
this
week
also
showed
support
for
impeachment
on
the
rise
in
that
survey
said
impeachment
proceedings
should
begin
up
points
from
the
previous
poll
there
needs
to
be
more
data
to
tell
us
where
public
opinion
is
and
where
it
will
be
the
npr
poll
was
conducted
over
one
night
after
the
call
notes
were
released
but
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
was
made
public
developments
in
this
story
have
been
fast-moving
and
the
details
are
still
settling
in
for
the
american
public
democrats
will
have
to
work
to
win
over
independents
support
for
beginning
an
impeachment
inquiry
may
be
trending
upward
but
the
poll
also
found
that
democrats
have
some
work
to
do
to
win
over
key
groups
such
as
independents
and
suburban
voters
just
of
independents
said
they
approved
of
the
inquiry
while
said
they
didn't
and
suburban
voters
were
split
approve
disapprove
the
messaging
fight
and
how
all
of
this
is
framed
over
the
next
many
weeks
will
be
key
more
on
that
below
still
the
center
appears
to
have
moved
as
to
be
expected
the
overwhelming
majority
of
democratic
lawmakers
are
in
favor
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
and
most
republicans
are
saying
there's
nothing
to
see
here
but
what
about
the
middle
many
key
moderate
democrats
those
critical
to
democrats
taking
back
the
house
in
centrist
districts
in
are
in
favor
of
the
inquiry
and
even
some
republicans
are
saying
the
call
is
troubling
so
you
don't
need
a
poll
to
tell
you
that's
where
the
center
is
immediately
following
the
release
of
the
call
notes
and
whistleblower
complaint
the
messaging
fight
is
on
this
is
so
key
democratic
strategists
acknowledge
their
party's
deficiency
with
independents
on
the
impeachment
question
and
they
say
it's
important
for
their
party
to
keep
the
message
simple
and
focused
the
call
what
transpired
and
the
favor
trump
was
asking
for
they
say
is
understandable
for
most
americans
that's
something
that
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
noted
as
well
and
that's
what
they
need
to
stay
laserlike
focused
on
they
say
they
worry
that
if
democrats
get
too
far
afield
with
other
grievances
against
trump
it
could
confuse
and
distract
republicans
in
trump's
corner
for
their
part
are
going
to
question
the
whistleblower's
character
talk
about
how
there
was
no
explicit
quid
pro
quo
and
continue
to
pivot
back
to
the
bidens
we
will
likely
know
whether
trump
will
be
impeached
by
the
end
of
the
year
democrats
don't
want
the
impeachment
inquiry
to
drag
on
voting
in
the
democratic
primary
begins
in
february
in
just
over
four
months
congressional
democrats
would
prefer
that
this
is
wrapped
up
before
then
that's
partially
why
they
are
likely
to
stay
narrowly
focused
on
the
ukraine
call
and
whistleblower
complaint
with
the
inquiry
spearheaded
by
rep
adam
schiff
and
the
house
intelligence
committee
instead
of
bringing
in
things
like
the
potential
obstruction
of
justice
incidents
laid
out
in
the
mueller
report
and
trump's
personal
financial
conflicts
the
potential
impeachment
of
a
sitting
president
will
be
front
and
center
and
will
overshadow
everything
else
so
get
ready
for
a
very
intense
focus
on
every
detail
trump
is
in
a
fight
for
his
political
life
and
the
country
is
about
to
see
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
impact
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
on
a
president
up
for
reelection
