democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
spoke
about
ukraine
and
president
trump
on
tuesday
updated
at
p
m
et
former
vice
president
joe
biden
called
for
president
trump's
impeachment
unless
the
white
house
complies
with
congressional
requests
for
information
about
a
call
the
president
made
to
a
ukrainian
leader
we
have
a
president
who
believes
there
is
no
limit
to
his
power
biden
said
we
have
a
president
who
believes
he
can
do
anything
and
get
away
with
it
we
have
a
president
who
believes
he
is
above
the
law
biden
said
trump
has
been
stonewalling
congress
about
the
ukraine
call
and
said
impeachment
would
be
a
tragedy
of
his
own
making
the
support
for
impeachment
is
a
shift
for
biden
unlike
most
of
the
presidential
field
he
had
resisted
calling
for
it
earlier
this
year
biden
said
impeachment
proceedings
would
be
a
gigantic
distraction
but
biden
now
calls
trump's
conduct
in
holding
up
aid
to
ukraine
an
abuse
of
power
the
allegation
that
trump
blocked
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
congressionally
approved
aid
to
another
country
unless
ukraine's
leader
agreed
to
smear
a
political
opponent
is
not
the
conduct
of
an
american
president
biden
said
it's
an
abuse
of
power
biden
made
the
remarks
hours
ahead
of
a
planned
meeting
by
house
democrats
at
which
they
are
expected
to
take
a
decision
about
next
moves
on
impeachment
biden
is
a
particularly
important
piece
of
this
puzzle
as
he
has
been
at
the
center
of
trump's
tactic
to
try
to
deflect
attention
from
the
controversy
without
evidence
and
furthering
a
conspiracy
theory
populated
in
conservative
circles
trump
has
accused
biden
of
strong-arming
ukraine
with
funding
to
help
his
son
hunter
who
was
serving
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
while
many
point
to
hunter
biden
as
cashing
in
on
the
biden
name
joe
biden
was
carrying
out
obama
administration
policy
in
calling
for
the
removal
from
office
of
a
prosecutor
whom
western
alliance
countries
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
world
bank
saw
as
corrupt
so
biden
was
hardly
freelancing
the
allegations
of
corruption
against
the
gas
company
burisma
predated
hunter
biden's
joining
its
board
in
fact
burisma
brought
hunter
biden
on
board
in
an
effort
to
look
like
it
was
cleaning
up
its
act
joe
biden
on
tuesday
again
denied
any
wrongdoing
what's
more
the
fired
prosecutor's
investigation
into
burisma
had
been
completed
before
biden
acting
on
behalf
of
the
obama
administration
asked
for
him
to
be
removed
and
many
in
ukraine
credit
joe
biden
with
helping
in
the
effort
to
clean
up
corruption
in
the
country
while
hunter
biden's
involvement
in
the
gas
company
threatens
to
continue
to
be
a
headache
for
biden
and
his
campaign
the
controversy
surrounding
trump
has
actually
had
the
effect
of
insulating
biden
at
least
for
now
in
the
democratic
primary
for
months
biden
who
has
been
leading
in
the
polls
had
been
facing
withering
criticism
from
other
democratic
candidates
because
of
his
more
moderate
policies
and
restorative
vision
for
the
country
but
democratic
candidates
haven't
been
able
to
criticize
him
for
days
now
the
saga
could
end
up
hardening
some
of
his
support
and
increasing
sympathy
for
him
among
democratic
primary
voters
a
growing
number
of
house
democrats
including
civil
rights
icon
john
lewis
and
seven
freshmen
are
throwing
their
support
behind
an
impeachment
inquiry
