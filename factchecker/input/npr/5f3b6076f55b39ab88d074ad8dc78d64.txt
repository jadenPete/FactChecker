lawmakers
in
california
have
advanced
a
bill
aimed
at
ensuring
minimum
wage
workers
compensation
and
other
benefits
for
contract
workers
in
the
gig
economy
the
state
senate
passed
the
measure
known
as
assembly
bill
on
tuesday
evening
the
move
is
likely
to
have
major
ramifications
for
on-demand
delivery
and
ride-hailing
companies
such
as
uber
doordash
and
lyft
which
classify
most
of
their
workers
as
independent
contractors
the
bill
passed
on
the
strength
of
democratic
support
on
a
party-line
vote
of
now
the
bill
heads
to
the
state
assembly
where
it
is
expected
to
be
approved
as
well
and
california
gov
gavin
newsom
who
endorsed
the
bill
in
an
op-ed
earlier
this
month
has
indicated
that
he
will
sign
it
this
is
a
huge
win
for
workers
across
the
nation
the
california
labor
federation
said
in
a
statement
posted
to
twitter
it's
time
to
rebuild
the
middle
class
and
ensure
all
workers
have
the
basic
protections
they
deserve
the
bill
authored
by
lorena
gonzalez
a
democratic
assemblywoman
from
san
diego
aims
to
codify
a
ruling
last
year
from
the
state
supreme
court
in
its
page
opinion
the
court
applied
a
test
to
distinguish
contractors
from
employees
the
bill
sums
up
this
distinction
in
the
following
way
as
an
employee
rather
than
an
independent
contractor
a
worker
is
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
and
is
expected
to
deposit
money
into
the
statewide
fund
in
his
op-ed
published
in
the
sacramento
bee
newsom
asserted
that
the
misclassification
of
employees
as
contractors
has
helped
exacerbate
income
inequality

are

the
bill
he
wrote
reversing
the
trend
of
misclassification
is
a
necessary
and
important
step
to
improve
the
lives
of
working
people
a
number
of
companies
have
expressed
their
vehement
opposition
to
the
bill
maintaining
that
such
a
massive
shift
in
worker
status
will
hamper
the
flexibility
needed
to
allow
their
businesses
to
operate
effectively
reclassification
misses
two
important
points
first
most
drivers
prefer
freedom
and
flexibility
to
the
forced
schedules
and
rigid
hourly
shifts
of
traditional
employment
and
second
many
drivers
are
supplementing
income
from
other
work

logan

and
john

wrote
in
a
joint
op-ed
published
in
the
san
francisco
chronicle
in
june
it's
also
no
secret
that
a
change
to
the
employment
classification
of
ride-share
drivers
would
pose
a
risk
to
our
businesses
they
added
lyft
uber
and
doordash
have
pledged
to
put
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
toward
a
possible
ballot
initiative
to
undo
the
bill's
effects
the
bill
does
carve
out
exceptions
for
some
occupations
including
licensed
insurance
agents
commercial
fishermen
and
investment
advisers
among
others
construction
truckers
are
also
exempt
from
the
bill's
provisions
though
the
trucking
industry
in
general
is
not
the
fact
that
so
many
of
these
fields
were
excepted
is
very
telling
lyft
said
in
a
statement
after
tuesday's
vote
we
are
fully
prepared
to
take
this
issue
to
the
voters
of
california
to
preserve
the
freedom
and
access
drivers
and
riders
want
and
need
uber
and
lyft
currently
employ
an
estimated
drivers
classified
as
contractors
in
the
state
according
to
sacramento
member
station
capital
public
radio
but
the
reverberations
of
the
bill
are
not
expected
to
end
at
state
lines
everyone
is
looking
to
california
right
now
labor
attorney
monique
ngo-bonnici
told
npr's
yuki
noguchi
earlier
this
month
and
they're
all
following
it
with
bated
breath
because
they
recognize
that
likely
whatever
happens
in
california
is
going
to
sweep
across
the
country
