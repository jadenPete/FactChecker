federal

chairman
jerome
powell
said
the
central
bank
will
act
as
appropriate
to
sustain
the
economic
expansion
as
the
trade
war
with
china
takes
a
toll
on

and
the
u.s.
economy
in

friday

powell
said
the
economy
faces
significant
risks
and
cited
several
developments
that
have
roiled
financial
markets
in
recent
weeks
those
developments
include
new
u.s.
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
signs
of
a
global
slowdown
namely
in
the
economic
powerhouses
germany
and
china
and
the
growing
possibility
that
the
united
kingdom
will
leave
the
european
union
without
a
deal
trade
policy
uncertainty
seems
to
be
playing
a
role
in
the
global
slowdown
and
in
weak
manufacturing
and
capital
spending
in
the
united
states
powell
said
he
said
the
u.s.
economy
has
continued
to
perform
well
driven
by
consumer
spending
but
job
creation
has
slowed
based
on
our
assessment
of
the
implications
of
these
developments
we
will
act
as
appropriate
to
sustain
the
expansion
powell
said
last
month
the
fed
cut
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
decade
lowering
the
cost
of
borrowing
for
credit
cards
auto
loans
and
mortgages
president
trump
has
repeatedly
pressured
the
fed
to
lower
interest
rates
further
to
boost
the
economy
and
this
week
he
called
for
a
dramatic
one-percentage-point
cut
on
friday
trump
again
tweeted
his
criticism
of
the
central
bank
we
have
a
very
strong
dollar
and
a
very
weak
fed
my
only
question
is
who
is
our
bigger
enemy
jay
powell
or
chairman
xi
trump's
tweets
came
shortly
after
china
announced
retaliatory
tariffs
against
billion
in
u.s.
goods
in
his
remarks
powell
said
that
while
monetary
policy
is
a
powerful
tool
that
works
to
support
consumer
spending
business
investment
and
public
confidence
it
cannot
provide
a
settled
rulebook
for
international
trade
he
also
addressed
another
issue
on
the
mind
of
market
watchers
whether
the
long
u.s.
expansion
is
leading
banks
and
other
financial
firms
to
take
more
risks
we
have
not
seen
unsustainable
borrowing
financial
booms
or
other
excesses
of
the
sort
that
occurred
at
times
before
the
great
recession
and
i
continue
to
judge
overall
financial
stability
risks
to
be
moderate
he
said
but
we
remain
vigilant
