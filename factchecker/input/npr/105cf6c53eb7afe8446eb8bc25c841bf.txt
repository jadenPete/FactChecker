a
federal
judge
has
blocked
the
trump
administration's
effort
to
expand
fast-track
deportation
regulations
for
undocumented
immigrants
without
the
use
of
immigration
courts
the
procedure
known
as
expedited
removal
has
previously
been
used
to
deport
undocumented
immigrants
who
cross
into
the
u.s.
by
land
without
an
immigration
hearing
or
access
to
an
attorney
if
they
are
arrested
within
miles
of
the
border
within
two
weeks
of
their
arrival
in
july
the
administration
expanded
the
rule
to
include
undocumented
immigrants
who
couldn't
prove
they
had
been
in
the
u.s.
continuously
for
two
years
or
more
no
matter
where
they
were
in
the
country
in
a
page
report
issued
just
before
midnight
on
friday
u.s.
district
judge
ketanji
brown
jackson
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
on
the
policy
change
she
stated
that
the
administration
did
not
follow
the
correct
decision-making
procedures
such
as
the
formal
notice-and-comment
period
required
for
major
federal
rule
changes
and
likely
violated
federal
law
in
failing
to
do
so
she
said
that
no
good
cause
exists
for
the
agency
to
have
not
complied
with
these
mandates
in
this
instance
jackson
who
is
an
obama-era
appointee
also
said
that
the
july
notice
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
seemed
arbitrary
and
capricious
put
in
common
parlance
if
a
policy
decision
that
an
agency
makes
is
of
sufficient
consequence
that
it
qualifies
as
an
agency
rule
then
arbitrariness
in
deciding
the
contours
of
that
rule
e
g
decision
making
by
ouija
board
or
dart
board
rock
paper
scissors
or
even
the
magic
ball
simply
will
not
do
jackson
wrote
there
are
well-established
legal
constraints
on
the
manner
in
which
an
agency
exercises
its
discretion
to
make
discretionary
policy
decisions
and
there
are
also
legally
established
consequences
if
an
agency
does
not
adhere
to
these
procedural
requirements
when
it
determines
the
policies
that
it
imposes
the
department
of
homeland
security
had
argued
that
the
policy
change
would
relieve
overburdened
immigration
courts
and
harmonize
existing
regulations
to
apply
equally
to
undocumented
immigrants
whether
they
arrive
by
land
or
sea
the
effect
of
that
change
will
be
to
enhance
national
security
and
public
safety
while
reducing
government
costs
by
facilitating
prompt
immigration
determinations
dhs
said
in
the
july
notice
we
are
past
the
breaking
point
and
must
take
all
appropriate
action
to
enforce
the
law
along
the
u.s.
borders
and
within
the
country's
interior
said
acting
secretary
of
homeland
security
kevin
mcaleenan
when
the
new
policy
was
announced
this
designation
makes
it
clear
that
if
you
have
no
legal
right
to
be
here
we
will
remove
you
the
american
civil

union
american

council

llp
sought
the
preliminary
injunction
the
court
rejected
the
trump
administration's
illegal
attempt
to
remove
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
from
the
u.s.
without
any
legal
recourse
aclu
attorney
anand
balakrishnan
who
argued
the
case
said
in
a
statement
this
ruling
recognizes
the
irreparable
harm
of
this
policy
in
a
statement
saturday
afternoon
a
department
of
justice
spokesman
said
the
preliminary
injunction
blocks
the
expanded
expedited
removal
policy
from
being
applied
until
the

has
finished

on
the
matter
