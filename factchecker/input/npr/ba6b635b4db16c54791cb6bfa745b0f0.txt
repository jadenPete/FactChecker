the
report
will
be
studied
closely
by
forecasters
trying
to
gauge
the
strength
of
the
u.s.
economy
which
has
been
sending
mixed
signals
in
recent
days
surveys
this
week
from
the
institute
for
supply
management
painted
starkly
different
pictures
of
the
manufacturing
sector
which
has
been
battered
by
the
u.s.
trade
war
with
china
and
the
much
larger
services
side
of
the
economy
which
continues
to
show
strong
growth
factories
added
just
jobs
last
month
manufacturing
activity
shrank
in
august
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
we've
certainly
seen
a
divide
where
the
manufacturing
sector
has
weakened
much
more
notably
said
senior
economist
sarah
house
of
wells
fargo
securities
but
we
have
seen
some
softening
in
the
broader
service
sector
as
well
employers
added
fewer
than
two-thirds
as
many
service
jobs
in
august
as
in
the
two
previous
months
still
manufacturing
is
more
sensitive
than
the
services
sector
to
global
forces
such
as
the
trade
war
if
the
manufacturing
slowdown
is
contained
the
fallout
could
be
limited
we
haven't
had
a
manufacturing-led
recession
for
years
said
jared
bernstein
an
economist
with
the
center
on
budget
and
policy
priorities
it
doesn't
mean
we
couldn't
but
we're
now
talking
about
a
sector
that's
of
employment
and
of
output
those
numbers
used
to
be
three
times
that
bernstein
said
that
while
the
manufacturing
sector
is
probably
in
a
recession
already
that
need
not
bring
down
the
larger
economy
don't
see

it's
not
pretty
and
it's
not
something
i
like
to
see
and
it's
a
totally
self-inflicted
wound
so
it's
really
dumb
said
bernstein
who
served
as
economic
adviser
to
former
vice
president
joe
biden
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
recessionary
at
this
point
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
also
downplayed
recession
fears
friday
during
an
appearance
in
switzerland
we
see
the
most
likely
case
for
the
u.s.
and
for
the
world
too
as
continued
moderate
growth
powell
said
we're
going
to
continue
to
act
as
appropriate
to
sustain
this
expansion
the
fed
is
widely
expected
to
cut
interest
rates
by
a
quarter
percentage
point
when
officials
meet
later
this
month
but
powell
acknowledged
differences
among
his
colleagues
about
how
much
monetary
medicine
the
slowing
economy
needs
there
will
always
be
questions
about
how
much
to
do
and
how
fast
to
move
powell
said
sometimes
things
are
relatively
clear
other
times
it's
murky
out
there
there's
a
range
of
views
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
times
the
jobs
report
seemed
likely
to
reinforce
those
fed
officials
who
are
calling
for
a
modest
dose
of
additional
stimulus
average
hourly
wages
rose
by
cents
in
august
to
an
average
annual
increase
of
wage
gains
and
low
unemployment
helped
to
fuel
strong
consumer
spending
during
the
spring
and
summer
household
consumption
right
now
is
propping
up
the
u.s.
economy
said
joe
brusuelas
chief
economist
for
the
audit
and
consulting
firm
rsm
we'll
see
if
the
uncertainty
tax
that's
been
placed
on
the
economy
by
trade
policy
begins
to
adversely
influence
consumer
attitudes
a
significant
chunk
of
consumer
spending
is
now
going
to
nontraditional
retailers
the
retail
sector
continued
to
hemorrhage
workers
shedding
jobs
in
august
there
was
some
positive
news
in
the
monthly
jobs
report
the
labor
force
participation
rate
jumped
two-tenths
of
a
percentage
point
to
and
the
average
workweek
rose
by
a
tenth
of
an
hour
