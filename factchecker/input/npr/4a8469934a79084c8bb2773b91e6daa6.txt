twisting
emma

famous
words
on
a
bronze
plaque
at
the
statue
of
liberty
cuccinelli
was
speaking
to
npr's
morning
edition
about
a
new
regulation
he
announced
monday
that
targets
legal
immigration
the
rule
denies
green
cards
and
visas
to
immigrants
if
they
use
or
are
deemed
likely
to
need
federal
state
and
local
government
benefits
including
food
stamps
housing
vouchers
and
medicaid
the
change
stands
to
impact
hundreds
of
thousands
of
immigrants
who
come
to
the
united
states
legally
every
year
the
final
version
of
the
public
charge
rule
is
scheduled
to
be
published
wednesday
in
the
federal
register
a
public
charge
refers
to
a
person
who
relies
on
public
assistance
for
help
on
tuesday
cuccinelli
described
the
public
charge
as
a
burden
on
the
government
he
told
npr
the
new
regulation
was
a
prospective
rule
part
of
president
trump
keeping
his
promises
the
new
rule
will
go
into
effect
oct
and
only
government
aid
used
after
that
point
will
be
assessed
cuccinelli
said
welfare
benefits
will
be
just
one
factor
that
immigration
service
officers
use
to
determine
an
applicant's
fate
in
the
united
states
in
addition
to
age
health
education
and
financial
status
if
they
don't
have
future
prospects
of
being
legal
permanent
residents
without
welfare
that
will
be
counted
against
them
cuccinelli
said
all
immigrants
who
can
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
self-sufficient
pull
themselves
up
by
their
bootstraps
would
be
welcome
he
added
asked
if
that
changes
the
definition
of
the
american
dream
cuccinelli
said
no
one
has
a
right
to
become
an
american
who
isn't
born
here
as
an
american
then
he
clarified
it
is
a
privilege
to
become
an
american
not
a
right
for
anybody
who
is
not
already
an
american
citizen
that's
what
i
was
referring
to
he
said
the
welcoming
words
from
the
plaque
at
the
statue
of
liberty
give
me
your
tired
your
poor
were
put
there
at
almost
the
same
time
as
when
the
first
public
charge
law
was
passed
in
critics
have
denounced
the
rule
as
a
sweeping
attempt
to
stem
immigration
and
favor
wealthy
migrants
the
regulation
is
expected
to
be
challenged
by
immigration
groups
in
court
leon
fresco
a
former
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
obama
administration
said
the
case
could
wind
up
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
i
also
expect
lawsuits
from
individuals
who
say
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
congress
provided
certain
benefits
to
be
accessible
by
certain
groups
of
immigrants
that
meant
that
they
did
not
want
them
then
banned
under
the
public
charge
rule
fresco
told
npr
rumors
that
the
trump
administration
was
considering
the
regulation
already
led
to
a
chilling
effect
on
immigrants
looking
to
put
down
roots
through
legal
and
permanent
residency
public

and
housing
aid
for
themselves
and
their
children
who
may
be
u.s.
citizens
cuccinelli
a
former
virginia

long
held
a
hard-line
stance
against
immigration
and
asylum
policies
