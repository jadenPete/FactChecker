apologized
after
after

a
young
man
saying
he
has
no
plans
to
resign

continue
his
campaign
for

in
october
darkening
your
face
regardless

the

face
trudeau
said
at
a
news
conference
thursday
in
a
public
park
in
winnipeg
i
should
have
understood
that
then

i
never
should

done
it
his
remarks

a
white

laughing
with
his

trudeau
sidestepped
questions
thursday
about
how
many
times
he
has
worn
blackface
or
brownface
obviously
this
is
deeply
regrettable
trudeau
said
i'm
wary
of
being
definitive
about
this
because
the
recent
pictures
that
came
out
i
had
not
remembered
and
i
think
the
question
is
how
could
you
not
remember
that
pausing
he
added
i
didn't
understand
how
hurtful
this
is
to
people
who
live
with
discrimination

single
day

and
disappointed
in
the
prime
minister
calling

the
country
reactions
from
the
ranks
of
trudeau's

party
seemed
to
be
mixed

and
fellow
liberal

a
record
of
promoting
diversity

too
were
disappointed
and

on
