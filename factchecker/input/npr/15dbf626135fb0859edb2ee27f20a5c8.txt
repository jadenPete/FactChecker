outside

u.s.
capitol
building
on
thursday
americans
are
split
on
whether
they
approve
of
democrats
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
trump
and
independents
at
this
point
are
not
on
board
a
new
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
finds
but
the
pollsters
warn
that
the
new
developments
could
change
public
opinion
quickly
especially
with
in
saying
they
are
paying
attention
to
the
news
democrats
in
the
house
have
work
to
do
to
convince
people
of
the
usefulness
of
their
case
said
lee
miringoff
director
of
the
marist
institute
for
public
opinion
which
conducted
the
survey
of
americans
the
poll
was
conducted
wednesday
night
with
live
phone
interviewers
that
was
one
day
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
announced
the
impeachment
inquiry
but
before
a
whistleblower
complaint
about
the
president's
call
with
the
ukrainian
leader
was
released
to
the
public
miringoff
added
that
while
independents
still
need
to
be
convinced
the
next
few
days
are
going
to
be
crucial
for
both
democrats
and
republicans
who
will
be
making
their
cases
about
the
validity
of
the
inquiry
it's
very
important
miringoff
said
because
this
is
sort
of
like
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
potential
storm
here
americans
are
also
split
on
whether
the
impeachment
inquiry
is
a
serious
matter
or
just
politics
and
whether
it's
worth
going
through
with
if
the
senate
doesn't
convict
and
trump
gets
to
stay
in
office
by
a
point
margin
they
say
it's
not
worth
it
important
for
democrats
half
of
independents
disapprove
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
and
don't
think
it's
worth
it
if
the
senate
doesn't
convict
people
who
live
in
the
suburbs
whom
democrats
relied
on
for
support
in
the
midterms
to
take
back
the
house
are
largely
split
on
each
of
those
questions
on
the
impeachment
inquiry
of
those
living
in
the
suburbs
approve
while
disapprove
and
on
whether
it's
worth
it
they
divide
evenly
familiar
fissures
also
emerge
by
party
gender
education
and
place
democrats
women
especially
college-educated
women
and
people
who
live
in
big
cities
are
in
favor
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
republicans
people
who
live
in
rural
areas
and
men
largely
are
not
don't

overall
say
they
have
been
paying
very
close
or
fairly
close
attention
to
the
news
about
the
house
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
more
republicans
said
they've
at
least
followed
the
news
on
this
fairly
closely
than
democrats
or
independents
but
overwhelmingly
people
want
to
hear
more
with
three-quarters
of
americans
including
a
majority
of
republicans
saying
the
whistleblower
should
testify
before
congress
a
majority
also
think
there
needs
to
be
investigation
into
the
ukraine
call
and
the
president
asking
about
the
bidens
with
of
voters
calling
it
a
very
serious
matter
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
fight
between
the
two
parties
waging
a
messaging
war
to
try
to
win
over
persuadable
voters
and
right
now
independents
are
saying
they
don't
approve
of
the
job
trump
is
doing
but
they
disapprove
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
more
what's
more
the
president's
base
is
more
behind
him
than
pelosi's
is
behind
her
of
republicans
approve
of
trump's
job
as
opposed
to
of
democrats
saying
the
same
about
pelosi
trump's
overall
approval
rating
is
about
where
it's
been
but
pelosi
comes
off
worse
at
viewed
worst
of
all
of
the
leaders
in
washington
however
is
mitch
mcconnell
just
approve
of
the
job
he
is
doing
so
it's
pretty
clear
whose
party
the
gop
is
methodology
the
poll
of
americans
was
conducted
with
live
telephone
callers
the
night
of
sept
the
margin
of
error
for
the
overall
sample
is
percentage
points
party
affiliation
results
reflect
the
respondents
who
identified
as
registered
voters
and
the
margin
of
error
is
percentage
points
