on

the
dnc
has
scrapped
a

plan
for

et
security
concerns
have
prompted
the
democratic
national
committee
to
recommend
nixing
a
plan
that
would
have
allowed
iowans
and
nevadans
to
remotely
caucus
for
candidates
next
year
supporters
have
long
argued
that
virtual
caucuses
would
open
up
iowa's
first-in-the-nation
presidential
contest
which
requires
caucusers
to
physically
attend
sometimes
hours-long
events
to
declare
their
choice
for
president
but
upon
the
recommendations
of
security
consultants
the
democratic
national
committee
said
friday
that
it
is
recommending
its
rules
and
bylaws
committee
reject
iowa's
and
nevada's
plans
when
it
votes
next
week
there
is
no
tele-caucus
system
available
that
meets
our
standard
of
security
and
reliability
given
the
scale
needed
for
the
iowa
and
nevada
caucuses
and
the
current
cybersecurity
climate
said
dnc
leadership
in
a
statement
for
these
reasons
we
are
recommending
to
the
committee
that
virtual
caucus
systems
not
be
used
in
the
iowa
and
nevada
caucus
processes
iowa's
caucuses
require
voters
to
go
out
in
brutally
cold
february
weather
and
because
the
caucuses
take
place
at
set
times
and
set
places
people
with
inflexible
hours
at
work
also
have
trouble
attending
predictably
all
this
has
suppressed
turnout
and
led
to
many
calls
for
reform
in
the
iowa
caucus
turnout
rate
was
under
percent
for
the
primary
elections
the
plan
proposed
by
the
state
party
would
have
allowed
people
to
participate
in
one
of
six
virtual
caucuses
in
late
january
or
early
february
the
technical
details
had
not
been
made
public
but
an
initial
plan
released
earlier
this
year
said
the
virtual
caucuses
may
include
a
teleconference
online
virtual
conference
or
another
secure
method
in
july
iowa
party
officials
said
the
caucus
would
be
accessible
by
phone
the
associated
press
reported
nevada
had
proposed
a
similar
plan
for
its
caucuses
later
in
february
some
polling
suggested
that
virtual
participation
could
have
increased
turnout
in
the
iowa
caucus
by
almost
percent
but
after
reviewing
preliminary
technical
plans
data
flow
designs
and
vendor
contracts
that
the
state
parties
provided
the
dnc's
chief
security
officers
said
in
a
memo
that
they
concluded
that
currently
there
is
no
tele-caucus
system
available
that
is
sufficiently
secure
and
reliable
accessibility
vs
security
the
veto
by
the
national
democratic
party
underscores
the
constant
tension
in
voting
practices
between
accessibility
and
security
as
well
as
the
tricky
political
balance
that
comes
with
weighing
both
at
the
same
time
security
experts
say
that
it
is
not
yet
possible
to
truly
secure
voting
over
the
phone
or
internet
if
you're
doing
phone
voting
or
internet
voting
it's
pretty
much
garbage
in
garbage
out
you
don't
really
know
what
you're
getting
in
or
what's
coming
out
the
other
side
said
joseph
lorenzo
hall
the
chief
technologist
at
the
center
for
democracy
and
technology
this
is
why
we
often
demand
a
paper
record
a
software-independent
indelible
record
that
can
be
recounted
later
it
can't
be
hacked
a
source
familiar
with
the
dnc's
decision
said
iowa's
plan
would
pose
a
huge
risk
of
foreign
interference
and
that
several
democratic
candidates
had
voiced
concern
about
that
risk
as
well
hall
agreed
with
that
assessment
democrats
divided
notably
presidential
campaigns
were
hesitant
to
weigh
in
publicly
on
the
dnc's
decision
in
the
initial
hours
after
it
was
first
reported
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
was
among
the
first
to
respond
friday
issuing
a
statement
blasting
the
national
party's
move
as
a
decision
that
will
disenfranchise
tens
of
thousands
for
years
our
party
has
fought
for
increased
access
to
the
ballot
most
recently
evidenced
by
the
legal
struggles
in
georgia
north
carolina
and
my
home
state
of
texas
this
decision
goes
against
everything
our
party
says
we
stand
for
castro
said
he
said
the
hawkeye
state
needs
to
reform
the
way
it
selects
candidates
as
i've
campaigned
in
every
corner
of
iowa
i've
heard
from
teachers
home
care
workers
nurses
single
parents
shift
workers
and
senior
citizens
who
tell
me
the
same
thing
one
night
of
caucusing
is
not
enough
castro
said
but
sen
ron
wyden
d-ore
who
is
not
running
for
president
but
has
become
an
outspoken
supporter
of
election
security
upgrades
said
the
dnc
has
made
the
right
decision
expanding
caucus
participation
is
a
worthy
goal
however
phone
and
internet-based
caucusing
is
simply
too
vulnerable
to
attack
by
foreign
hackers
wyden
said
other
options
like
hand-marked
ranked-choice
paper
ballots
for
absentee
caucusgoers
would
also
increase
turnout
while
providing
strong
protections
against
hacking
he
said
democrats
are
on
high
alert
over
cybersecurity
risks
following
a
election
that
saw
russian
hackers
break
into
party
networks
and
release
internal
emails
that
were
damaging
to
hillary
clinton's
presidential
campaign
attackers
also
targeted
election
systems
in
multiple
states
successfully
breaking
into
the
voter
registration
system
in
illinois
and
two
county
government
networks
in
florida
there
is
no
evidence
any
votes
were
changed
in
the
election
or
any
data
were
manipulated
even
so
a
senate
intelligence
committee
report
released
this
summer
alluded
to
the
possibility
of
future
attacks
that
could
target
voting
systems
iowa
democratic
party
chair
troy
price
said
in
a
statement
that
he
was
disappointed
in
the
party's
decision
but
that
he
remains
confident
the
iowa
caucuses
will
be
our
best
yet
and
set
the
standard
for
years
to
come
while
only
five
months
remain
before
the
caucuses
we
will
explore
what
alternatives
may
exist
to
securely
increase
accessibility
from
previous
years
given
the
time
allowed
price
said
observers
said
the
dnc
made
the
right
decision
to
rein
in
the
iowa
virtual
caucus
showing
restraint
usually
isn't
exciting
or
flashy
wrote
joshua
geltzer
a
former
official
with
the
national
security
council
after
news
of
the
dnc's
decision
became
public
but
it
can
be
admirable
