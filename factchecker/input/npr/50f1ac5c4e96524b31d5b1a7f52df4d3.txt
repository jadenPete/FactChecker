president
trump
has
called
the
danish
prime
minister's
comments
nasty
after
she
rejected
the
idea
of
selling
greenland
to
the
united
states
as
absurd
in
an
escalation
of
diplomatic
tensions
that
began
suddenly
last
week
trump
complained
wednesday
at
the
white
house
that
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen's
statement
was
not
nice
and
showed
disrespect
all
she
had
to
do
was
say
no
we
wouldn't
be
interested
he
told
reporters
she's
not
talking
to
me
she's
talking
to
the
united
states
of
america
the
president
announced
in
a
tuesday
night
tweet
that
he
was
calling
off
his
visit
to
denmark
he
said
denmark
is
a
very
special
country
with
incredible
people
but
that
based
on
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen's
comments
that
she
would
have
no
interest
in
discussing
the
purchase
of
greenland
i
will
be
postponing
our
meeting
he
said
he
would
reschedule
his
visit
and
thanked
frederiksen
for
saving
a
great
deal
of
expense
for
both
the
united
states
and
denmark
by
being
so
direct
the
responses
from
greenland
and
denmark
have
ranged
from
frustration
to
anger
helle
thorning-schmidt
who
served
as
denmark's
first
female
prime
minister
from
to
expressed
incredulity
is
this
some
sort
of
joke
she
wrote
on
twitter
deeply
insulting
to
the
people
of
greenland
and
denmark
lars
lokke
rasmussen
who
became
prime
minister
after
thorning-schmidt
said
it
is
no
shame
not
to
show
up
if
you
haven't
been
invited
but
if
you
have
invited
yourself
rasmus
jarlov
a
member
of
danish
parliament
agreed
that
the
cancellation
was
insulting
tweeting
as
a
dane
and
a
conservative
it
is
very
hard
to
believe
are
parts
of
the
us
for
sale
alaska
please
show
more
respect
morten
ostergaard
the
leader
of
denmark's
social
liberal
party
said
trump's
move
shows
why
more
than
ever
we
should
consider
the
eu
countries
as
our
closest
allies
he
added
the
man
is
incalculable
greenlandic
politician
aaja
chemnitz
larsen
said
trump's
cancellation
showed
how
important
greenland
was
before
she
commended
denmark
for
rejecting
circus
trump
earlier
this
week
trump
confirmed
a
story
first
reported
in
the
wall
street
journal
that
he
had
asked
aides
to
look
into
the
idea
of
buying
greenland
a
self-governing
danish
overseas
territory
speaking
to
reporters
on
sunday
he
compared
the
idea
to
a
large
real
estate
deal
and
said
it's
something
we've
talked
about
he
suggested
that
the
island
which
is
financially
reliant
on
denmark
had
become
a
burden
for
copenhagen
and
that
it
was
strategically
interesting
to
the
united
states
in
a
tweet
on
monday
the
president
posted
a
digitally
altered
photo
of
a
golden
trump
tower
superimposed
on
a
seaside
village
with
the
caption
i
promise
not
to
do
this
to
greenland
trump
who
was
invited
to
visit
denmark
by
queen
margrethe
ii
and
was
scheduled
to
arrive
there
on
sept
had
said
sunday
that
any
visit
to
the
scandinavian
country
would
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
a
greenland
deal
a
claim
he
appeared
to
contradict
by
canceling
the
trip
in
denmark
and
greenland
reaction
to
the
president's
suggestion
ranged
from
a
polite
no
to
open
derision
greenland
is
not
for
sale
frederiksen
said
while
on
a
trip
to
greenland
earlier
this
week
i
strongly
hope
that
this
is
not
meant
seriously
when
the
story
first
surfaced
former
prime
minister
rasmussen
tweeted
incredulously
that
the
idea
must
be
an
april
fool's
day
joke
