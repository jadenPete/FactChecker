lessons
learned
american
officials
acknowledge
they
were
caught
a
bit
flat-footed
in
by
russia's
active
measures
operation
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
saw
various
pieces
of
what
the
russians
were
up
to
officials
say
but
did
not
put
it
all
together
until
it
was
too
late
in
the
eyes
of
some
observers
that
was
a
failure
of
imagination
on
the
part
of
the
national
security
community
for
example
russian
hacking
into
the
democratic
national
committee
was
seen
as
a
problem
but
the
conventional
wisdom
at
the
time
within
officialdom
was
that
moscow
was
doing
it
for
intelligence
purposes
spying
not
interfering
that
of
course
turned
out
to
be
wrong
the
russians
weaponized
the
stolen
information
by
publicly
releasing
it
via
wikileaks
and
others
once
it
hit
the
internet
it
was
quickly
sucked
up
into
media
reporting
and
the
broader
campaign
narrative
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
have
gone
back
and
studied
russia's
playbook
page
by
page
to
try
understand
what
they
did
and
how
they
did
it
to
prevent
a
repeat
performance
last
summer
one
of
the
things
that
we
immediately
did
was
we
went
back
and
look
at
and
thoroughly
understood
our
adversary
national
security
agency
director
gen
paul
nakasone
said
at
a
recent
security
conference
and
what
we
knew
coming
out
of
that
is
that
we
had
to
do
something
different
something
different
a
lot
has
changed
since
on
the
election
security
front
for
one
the
u.s.
government
has
its
eyes
focused
on
the
issue
this
time
around
that
on
its
own
is
a
significant
shift
from
three
years
ago
there
are
several
examples
of
how
election
security
is
a
priority
for
departments
and
agencies
tasked
with
keeping
the
country
safe
shortly
before
he
stepped
down
then-director
of
national
intelligence
dan
coats
appointed
shelby
pierson
to
oversee
and
coordinate
election
security
for
the
intelligence
community
the
fbi
meanwhile
has
had
a
foreign
influence
task
force
up
and
running
since
to
counter
efforts
to
undermine
elections
in
the
u.s.
the
bureau
also
has
briefed
democratic
candidates
about
cybersecurity
and
other
threats
to
their
campaigns
these
initial
briefings
were
basic
and
general
in
nature
people
familiar
with
them
say
but
they
did
provide
a
reminder
to
the
campaigns
of
potential
cyberthreats
and
ways
to
guard
against
them
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
also
getting
in
on
the
act
its
cybersecurity
and
infrastructure
security
agency
is
working
with
five
major
election
vendors
that
make
voting
and
election
management
systems
to
ensure
those
systems
are
as
secure
as
possible
for
according
to
a
dhs
official
and
finally
the
feds
have
taken
strides
to
make
sure
that
information
about
cyberthreats
gets
to
the
people
who
need
it
at
the
state
and
local
level
that's
important
because
elections
are
run
by
state
and
local
officials
not
the
federal
government
in
the
fbi
and
dhs
struggled
to
get
relevant
often
classified
information
to
those
officials
to
help
them
secure
their
systems
now
certain
state
election
officials
have
been
given
clearance
to
receive
classified
information
making
it
easier
to
read
them
in
about
reporting
from
the
intelligence
community
it's
working
really
well
the
level
of
information
and
intelligence
sharing
with
state
and
local
officials
fbi
associate
deputy
director
paul
abbate
said
at
a
recent
conference
staying
ahead
of
the
threat
not
after
something
has
occurred
has
been
an
incredible
shift
not
just
playing

officials
say
that
securing
the
elections
from
outside
interference
isn't
just
about
playing
defense
anymore
the
u.s.
is
also
going
on
the
offensive
that
is
what
the
national
security
agency
calls
persistent
engagement
what
that
means
in
essence
is
tracking
online
adversaries
wherever
they
are
and
more
and
more
taking
action
against
them
the
midterm
elections
provided
a
glimpse
of
what
that
looks
like
during
the
midterms

took

period

the

farm
behind
moscow's
disinformation
campaign
according
to
reports
that
operation
combined
with
efforts
by
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
helped
make
the
election
perhaps
the
most
secure
ever
from
a
cyber
perspective
officials
have
said
social
media
russian
influence
specialists
used
social
media
platforms
including
twitter
and
facebook
to
push
disinformation
and
sow
discord
during
the
campaign
the
companies
like
the
u.s.
government
were
slow
to
catch
on
to
what
the
russians
were
up
to
once
the
extent
of
the
russian
abuse
became
clear
the
tech
firms
came
under
fire
for
allowing
it
to
happen
anxious
to
avoid
a
repeat
the
tech
firms
are
now
working
with
the
government
to
try
to
protect
social
media
platforms
from
foreign
manipulation
the
fbi
has
been
working
with
the
companies
to
alert
them
to
the
tradecraft
tactics
and
procedures
that
foreign
adversaries
are
using
the
bureau
and
the
tech
firms
are
also
sharing
information
on
what
they're
seeing
from
foreign
adversaries
it
goes
both
ways
the
fbi's
abbate
said
we're
pushing
information
and
intelligence
out
to
the
companies
to
help
them
spot
bad
actors
on
their
platforms
and
remove
them
and
they're
giving
information
back
to
us
to
inform
our
efforts
so
we
can
aggressively
go
out
and
take
action
against
them
and
cut
them
off
at
the
knees
looming
over
all
of
the
government's
efforts
to
protect
the
election
from
foreign
interference
is
the
understanding
that
while
the
u.s.
is
taking
steps
to
secure
the
vote
the
russians
and
other
adversaries
are
likely
to
change
up
their
playbook
too
