updated
at
p
m
et
a
government
whistleblower
received
information
from
multiple
officials
that
president
trump
is
using
the
power
of
his
office
to
solicit
interference
from
a
foreign
country
in
the
u.s.
election
an
unclassified
version
of
the
whistleblower's
complaint
made
public
thursday
by
the
house
intelligence
committee
says
that
the
president's
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
is
a
central
figure
in
this
effort
attorney
general
william
barr
appears
to
be
as
well
the
complaint
centers
on
trump's
july
call
with
the
president
of
ukraine
an
account
of
which
was
released
wednesday
by
the
white
house
that
memorandum
shows
trump
asking
the
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
for
a
favor
to
investigate
potential
rival
former
vice
president
joe
biden
what
the
complaint
released
thursday
further
reveals
is
that
the
whistleblower
was
told
by
officials
that
the
record
of
the
call
was
handled
differently
than
other
such
transcripts
it
was
placed
in
an
electronic
system
that
is
used
to
store
especially
sensitive
classified
information
also
officials
told
the
whistleblower
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
such
an
action
had
taken
place
for
apparently
political
rather
than
security
reasons
trump
and
the
white
house
dismissed
the
complaint
and
stood
by
the
phone
call
democratic
lawmakers
meanwhile
have
new
threads
to
pursue
with
an
ongoing
impeachment
inquiry
what
the
complaint
says
the
whistleblower
says
that
during
the
call
trump
sought
to
pressure
the
ukrainian
leader
to
take
actions
to
help
the
president's
reelection
bid
according
to
the
whistleblower
white
house
officials
were
deeply
disturbed
by
what
had
transpired
in
the
phone
call
the
complainant
said
that
afterward
senior
white
house
officials
had
intervened
to
lock
down
all
records
of
the
phone
call
which
the
whistleblower
says
underscored
to
me
that
white
house
officials
understood
the
gravity
of
what
had
transpired
in
the
call
the
whistleblower
said
that
according
to
officials
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
presidential
transcript
was
placed
into
a
codeword-level
system
solely
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
politically
sensitive
rather
than
national
security
sensitive
information
translation
white
house
officials
added
security
to
restrict
the
circle
of
people
who
might
be
able
to
view
them
that
is
likely
to
raise
questions
about
just
what
other
information
might
be
so
protected
relating
to
trump's
other
conversations
with
foreign
leaders
white
house
pushes
back
on
thursday
trump
repeated
his
characterization
of
the
call
with
his
ukrainian
counterpart
as
perfect
he
said
democrats
investigation
of
the
call
and
related
activities
shouldn't
be
allowed
there
should
be
a
way
of
stopping
it
maybe
legally
through
the
courts
earlier
trump
harshly
denounced
those
who
provided
the
details
of
the
white
house
activities
pertaining
to
the
call
to
the
whistleblower
according
to
an
account
in
the
los
angeles
times
trump
told
a
private
gathering
of
u.s.
united
nations
staff
thursday
in
new
york
i
want
to
know
who's
the
person
who's
the
person
who
gave
the
whistleblower
the
information
because
that's
close
to
a
spy
trump
said
you
know
what
we
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
smart
right
the
spies
and
treason
we
used
to
handle
it
a
little
differently
than
we
do
now

eliot

adam
schiff
and

and
government
reform's
elijah
cummings
issued
a
statement
thursday
evening
saying
trump's
comments
had
crossed
a
line
into
reprehensible
witness
intimidation
and
an
attempt
to
obstruct
congress
impeachment
inquiry
threats
of
violence
from
the
leader
of
our
country
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
entire
whistleblower
process
with
grave
consequences
for
our
democracy
and
national
security
the
chairmen
said
in
the
statement
the
white
house
issued
a
statement
earlier
on
thursday
portraying
the
whistleblower's
complaint
as
unremarkable
nothing
has
changed
with
the
release
of
this
complaint
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
third-hand
accounts
of
events
and
cobbled-together
press
clippings
all
of
which
shows
nothing
improper

wrote
this
on

there
is
a
lot
in
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
is
concerning
we
need
to
fully
investigate
all
of
the
allegations
addressed
in
the
letter
and
the
first
step
is
to
talk
to
the
whistleblower
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
said
after
reading
the
whistleblower's
complaint
this
is
a
cover-up
pelosi
who
announced
the
start
of
formal
impeachment
inquiry
tuesday
called
it
a
sad
week
adding
this
is
nothing
that
we
take
lightly
will
washington
hear
from
the
whistleblower
although
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
committees
are
negotiating
with
an
attorney
for
the
person
whose
identity
remains
unknown
it
isn't
clear
when
congress
may
talk
with
the
person
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
told
the
house
intelligence
panel
on
thursday
that
he
didn't
know
the
person's
identity
senate
intelligence
committee
chairman
richard
burr
r-n
c.
and
vice
chairman
mark
warner
d-va
left
a
closed
session
with
maguire
signaling
that
they're
continuing
to
gather
information
but
declining
to
give
a
firm
timetable
this
will
generate
more
questions
than
we
asked
today
so
the
next
two
weeks
will
probably
be
spent
trying
to
get
answers
to
those
burr
said
but
we
are
started
in
the
process
don't
expect
us
to
move
at
light
speed
that'll
probably
happen
in
the
house
warner
praised
the
bipartisan
nature
of
the
committee
and
said
that
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
came
out
of
today
is
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
whistleblower
process
people
need
to
be
able
to
come
forward
when
they've
seen
incidents
of
waste
fraud
abuse
or
inappropriate
behavior
and
feel
like
there
are
not
going
to
be
reprisals
as
to
whether
the
whistleblower
will
appear
before
the
committee
member
sen
roy
blunt
r-mo
said
he
wants
to
hear
from
the
person
and
i
think
we
will
beyond
the
whistleblower
the
discussions
about
the
actions
of
state
department
or
other
officials
in
the
complaint
offer
other
threads
for
members
of
congress
to
pursue
the
whistleblower
wrote
that
multiple
officials
told
me
that
ukrainian
leadership
was
led
to
believe
that
a
meeting
or
phone
call
between
trump
and
zelenskiy
would
be
contingent
on
whether
he
showed
willingness
to
play
ball
a
day
after
the
july
call
u.s.
diplomats
met
with
zelenskiy
and
other
ukrainian
political
officials
the
whistleblower
said
the
diplomats
reportedly
provided
advice
to
the
ukrainian
leadership
about
how
to
navigate
the
demands
that
the
president
had
made
of
mr
zelenskyy
lawmakers
likely
want
to
hear
more
about
how
american
diplomats
dealt
with
zelenskiy
or
other
ukrainians
before
or
after
the
phone
call
with
trump
separately
around
aug
giuliani
traveled
to
madrid
to
meet
with
one
of
zelenskiy's
advisers
in
what
the
whistleblower
says
multiple
u.s.
officials
characterized
as
a
direct
follow-up
to
the
president's
call
with
the
ukrainian
president
about
the
cases
they
had
discussed
earlier
in
may
the
complainant
reports
hearing
from
multiple
u.s.
officials
that
they
were
deeply
concerned
by
what
they
viewed
as
mr
giuliani's
circumvention
of
the
national
security
decision-making
processes
as
he
relayed
messages
back
and
forth
between
kyiv
and
the
president
