plans
to
terminate
a
military
intelligence-sharing
agreement
with
japan
prompting
concerns
about
security
cooperation
between
seoul
tokyo
and
washington
as
north
korea's
nuclear
and
missile
threats
loom
over
the
korean
peninsula
it's
the
latest
breakdown
between
seoul
and
tokyo
earlier
this
month
japan
removed
south
korea
from
its
whitelist
of
favored
trade
partners
prompting
a
retaliation
in
kind
the
blue
house
south
korea's
presidential
residence
in
seoul
announced
thursday
that
it
will
end
the
general
security
of
military
information
agreement
a
pact
pushed
by
the
obama
administration
and
signed
in
as
a
way
for
the
two
countries
to
exchange
valuable
information
on
potential
threats
posed
by
north
korea
china
and
russia
the
government
of
the
republic
of
korea
decided
that
maintaining
this
agreement
which
was
signed
to
facilitate
the
exchange
of
sensitive
military
information
does
not
serve
our
national
interest
kim
you-geun
deputy
director
of
the
country's
national
security
office
said
in
a
statement
seoul's
decision
was
made
public
before
a
saturday
deadline
that
would
have
automatically
renewed
the
agreement
for
another
year
south
korea
appeared
to
be
preparing
for
an
extension
but
that
changed
after
japan
abruptly
dropped
the
country
from
its
list
of
preferred
trade
partners
on
thursday
kim
blamed
tokyo
for
altering
their
relationship
through
the
downgrade
providing
no
concrete
evidence
for
the
decision
japan
has
also
imposed
export
controls
on
products
that
are
essential
to
south
korea's
booming
technology
industry
tokyo
said
the
move
was
made
on
national
security
grounds
but
the
two
countries
disputes
also
trace
back
to
japan's
colonial
occupation
of
korea
between
and
a
south
korean
supreme
court
ruling
last
year
allowed
korean
victims
of
forced
labor
during
world
war
ii
to
seek
compensation
from
japanese
firms
south
korea
also
shut
down
a
japanese-funded
foundation
that
supported
korean
comfort
women
who
were
forced
into
sexual
slavery
during
the
war
both
actions
incensed
the
japanese
government
japan's
downgrading
of
trade
ties
with
south
korea
escalated
tensions
between
the
countries
and
triggered
protests
outside
the
japanese
embassy
in
seoul
south
korean
president
moon
jae-in
vowed
that
we
will
never
again
lose
to
japan
and
the
prospect
of
pulling
out
of
the
military
intelligence-sharing
agreement
began
according
to
south
korea's
joongang
daily
newspaper
seoul
and
tokyo
have
communicated
about
military
intelligence
matters
at
least
seven
times
this
year
that
includes
exchanges
on
the
north's
recent
spate
of
short-range
missile
tests
even
after
tokyo's
decision
to
downgrade
its
trade
relationship
with
seoul
last
month
japan's
foreign
minister
taro
kono
said
tokyo
would
prefer
to
continue
sharing
intelligence
especially
on
north
korea
on
thursday
taro
said
seoul's
decision
completely
misreads
the
security
situation
in
northeast
asia
according
to
the
kyodo
news
agency
south
korean
foreign
minister
kang
kyung-wha
told
reporters
on
thursday
that
the
decision
amounted
to
a
trust
issue
she
said
seoul
is
preparing
to
explain
the
decision
to
both
japan
and
washington
and
that
the
decision
is
a
separate
issue
from
the
south
korea-u
s.
alliance
stressing
the
importance
of
the
two
u.s.
allies
relationship
with
each
other
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
thursday
that
they're
both
great
partners
and
friends
of
the
u.s.
we're
disappointed
to
see
the
decision
that
the
south
koreans
made
about
that
information-sharing
agreement
pompeo
said
during
a
visit
to
canada
we're
urging
each
of
the
two
countries
to
continue
to
engage
to
continue
to
have
dialogue
washington
has
long
sought
to
build
accord
between
seoul
and
tokyo
as
another
mechanism
to
confront
north
korea
and
a
burgeoning
china
pentagon
spokesman
lt
col
dave
eastburn
told
npr
that
the
department
of
defense
encourages
japan
and
south
korea
to
work
together
to
resolve
their
differences
and
he
said
he
hoped
it
could
be
done
quickly
we
are
all
stronger
and
northeast
asia
is
safer
when
the
united
states
japan
and
korea
work
together
in
solidarity
and
friendship
eastburn
said
intel
sharing
is
key
to
developing
our
common
defense
policy
and
strategy
both
pompeo
and
special
envoy
on
north
korea
steve
biegun
have
reportedly
nudged
america's
allies
to
patch
up
their
differences
but
critics
accuse
washington
of
letting
the
bad
blood
boil
between
tokyo
and
seoul
for
too
long
before
intervening
foreign
policy
experts
also
note
that
the
u.s.
faces
a
challenge
in
countering
the
deep
veins
of
nationalism
that
both
moon
and
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
have
mined
for
their
own
political
gains
whether
or
not
there
is
an
immediate
response
from
north
korea
china
or
russia
those
countries
are
likely
pleased
with
the
growing
rift
inside
the
u.s.
