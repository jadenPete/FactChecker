without

it's
been
eight
months
since
president
donald
trump's
first
secretary
of
defense
jim
mattis
handed
in
his
resignation
now
the
retired
four-star
general
has
written
his
first
book
co-authored
by
former
marine
bing
west
spoiler
alert
call
sign
chaos
learning
to
lead
is
not
as
the
title
might
suggest
a
tell-all
expos
of
mattis
tense
tenure
at
the
helm
of
the
pentagon
with
trump
as
commander
in
chief
i'm
old
fashioned
mattis
writes
i
don't
write
about
sitting
presidents
mattis
mentions
trump
by
name
only
four
times
all
in
the
prologue's
first
two
pages
each
instance
taking
place
prior
to
the
president's
taking
office
that
said
he
does
imply
criticism
without
directly
taking
shots
all
americans
need
to
recognize
that
our
democracy
is
an
experiment
and
one
that
can
be
reversed
mattis
writes
we
all
know
that
we
are
better
than
our
current
politics
mattis
maddening
refusal
to
offer
direct
thoughts
about
trump
does
not
apply
to
past
commanders
in
chief
his
war
stories
from
liberating
kuwait
to
invading
afghanistan
to
battling
insurgents
in
iraq
are
also
a
refighting
of
old
battles
with
officers
and
others
whose
wartime
guidance
he
portrays
as
deferring
more
to
presidential
whims
than
to
theater-of-war
realities
enjoying
his
perch
as
a
visiting
scholar
at
stanford
university's
hoover
institution
mattis
never
expected
trump
to
offer
him
the
pentagon's
top
job
i
figured
that
my
strong
support
of
nato
and
my
dismissal
of
the
use
of
torture
on
prisoners
would
have
the
president-elect
looking
for
another
candidate
he
writes
but
when
trump
who
had
never
met
mattis
before
interviewing
him
for
the
job
called
him
the
real
deal
and
asked
that
he
join
his
cabinet
the
self-described
political
independent
agreed
on
the
spot
in
my
view
when
the
president
asks
you
to
do
something
you
don't
play
hamlet
on
the
wall
wringing
your
hands
trump
may
have
believed
he
was
hiring
a
latter-day
gen
george
c.
patton
a
made-for-tv
war
hero
the
president-elect
would
repeatedly
refer
to
as
mad
dog
that
moniker
which
mattis
abhors
goes
unmentioned
in
his
book
instead
what
trump
got
was
the
seasoned
well-read
and
thoughtful
warrior-scholar
who
penned
this
memoir
the
only
cabinet
member
who
failed
to
laud
his
boss
in
front
of
tv
cameras
at
the
president's
first
full
staff
meeting
i
did
as
well
as
i
could
for
as
long
as
i
could
mattis
writes
he
left
about
halfway
into
what
he
expected
to
be
a
four-year
tenure
when
my
concrete
solutions
and
strategic
advice
especially
keeping
faith
with
allies
no
longer
resonated
it
was
time
to
resign
despite
the
limitless
joy
i
felt
serving
alongside
our
troops
in
defense
of
our
constitution
mattis
informs
us
this
book
has
been
in
the
works
since
he
previously
parted
ways
with
his
former
commander
in
chief
barack
obama
in
that
episode
he
was
fired
in
late
as
head
of
the
u.s.
central
command
call
sign
chaos
is
ostensibly
part
of
the
well-trodden
genre
of
leaders
keen
to
share
their
insights
on
what
it
takes
to
lead
my
purpose
in
writing
this
book
is
to
convey
the
lessons
i
learned
for
those
who
might
benefit
whether
in
the
military
or
in
civilian
life
mattis
writes
and
the
book
indeed
is
chockablock
with
insights
and
aphorisms
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
good
leader
it
begins
with
a
death-scraping
tumble
down
a
steep
icy
ridge
in
mattis
home
state
of
washington
when
he
was
alone
and
badly
battered
he
refused
a
stranger's
offer
for
a
lift
home
opting
instead
to
camp
by
himself
for
a
couple
of
days
and
nurse
his
wounds
that
fall
and
his
proud
insistence
on
recovering
alone
would
be
as
he
writes
a
metaphor
for
my
subsequent
career
in
the
marines
you
make
mistakes
or
life
knocks
you
down
either
way
you
get
up
and
get
on
with
it
you
deal
with
life
you
don't
whine
about
it
or
perhaps
you
write
about
it
chapter
by
chapter
mattis
takes
us
through
a
steady
rise
through
the
ranks
of
the
u.s.
marine
corps
an
ascent
he
self-deprecatingly
finds
inexplicable
every
time
i
made
a
mistake
and
i
made
many
he
writes
the
marines
promoted
me
mattis
tells
us
very
little
about
his
personal
life
there
is
nary
a
word
for
example
about
this
lifelong
bachelor's
broken
engagement
to
a
woman
who
could
not
countenance
a
life
of
constant
relocations
with
a
man
dedicated
to
an
often
lethal
job
he
does
disclose
that
as
a
mediocre
student
with
a
partying
attitude
at
central
washington
state
college
in
he
served
time
in
a
local
jail
on
weekends
as
punishment
for
underage
drinking
there
he
met
another
inmate
you
don't
always
control
your
circumstances
mattis
concludes
about
his
jailhouse
epiphany
but
you
can
always
control
your
response
his
book
is
a
compendium
of
circumstances
often
beyond
his
control
what
makes
it
a
compelling
read
is
how
this
warrior-monk
dealt
with
and
learned
from
the
jams
he
found
himself
in
his
call
sign
chaos
irreverently
bestowed
by
a
more
junior
marine
officer
is
an
acronym
does
the
colonel
have
another
outstanding
solution
the
gulf
war
was
mattis
first
battlefield
experience
it
would
become
his
touchstone
for
how
a
winning
war
should
be
waged
as
the
least
astute
battalion
commander
in
the
marine
corps
mattis
trained
his
charges
my
young
wolves
for
battle
in
the
desert
of
southern
california
and
the
peaks
of
the
sierra
nevada
farther
north
each
week
he
writes
the
blade
got
sharper
my
intent
was
to
rehearse
until
we
could
improvise
on
the
battlefield
like
a
jazzman
in
new
orleans
relocated
to
the
saudi
desert
mattis
would
walk
the
lines
after
dark
chatting
with
his
charges
and
learning
their
state
of
mind
troops
will
tell
you
things
when
they're
on
guard
duty
at
night
despite
leading
his
troops
into
an
ambush
at
one
point
after
three
days
with
almost
no
rest
mattis
took
part
in
a
clear
victory
the
u.s.
chased
the
iraqi
army
out
of
kuwait
during
hours
of
ground
combat
in
my
military
judgment
he
writes
president
george
h.w.
bush
knew
how
to
end
a
war
on
our
own
terms
he
approved
of
deploying
overwhelming
forces
to
compel
the
enemy's
withdrawal
or
swiftly
end
the
war
and
in
a
clear
dig
at
bush's
successors
mattis
added
that
bush
avoided
sophomoric
decisions
like
imposing
a
ceiling
on
the
number
of
troops
or
setting
a
date
when
we
would
have
to
stop
fighting
or
leave
a
decade
later
mattis
was
itching
to
avenge
the
sept
attacks
but
landlocked
afghanistan
was
not
a
place
where
the
marines
a
maritime
expeditionary
force
could
be
expected
to
make
a
forced
entry
by
sea
still
he
convinced
his
superiors
that
he
could
fly
marines
through
miles
of
pakistani
airspace
separating
afghanistan
and
the
arabian
sea
to
a
remote
airstrip
near
kandahar
it
never
entered
my
mind
that
we
might
fail
mattis
writes
marines
don't
know
how
to
spell
the
word
our
lads
were
ready
for
the
brawl
but
mattis
forced
entry
into
afghanistan
soon
had
him
clashing
with
gen
tommy
franks
the
top
u.s.
military
commander
in
afghanistan
he
writes
bitterly
of
being
told
by
franks
to
hold
his
troops
back
from
going
after
osama
bin
laden
in
the
al-qaida
leader's
mountain
hideout
of
tora
bora
rather
than
blaming
president
george
w.
bush
for
not
sending
in
the
marines
mattis
faulted
himself
for
failing
to
build
understanding
up
the
chain
of
command
of
how
his
forces
might
have
prevented
bin
laden's
escape
mattis
thoughts
on
bush's
decision
to
go
to
war
with
iraq
a
year
later
were
another
matter
invading
iraq
stunned
me
mattis
writes
why
were
we
fighting
them
again
toppling
the
iraqi
army
which
mattis
compares
to
a
tall
dead
tree
was
the
easy
part
left
unclear
he
writes
was
what
would
happen
after
that
i
had
no
specific
policy
guidance
the
chafing
by
mattis
against
his
superiors
is
sharpest
in
his
account
of
trying
to
seize
fallujah
after
four
americans
were
hanged
and
burned
there
by
sunni
insurgents
with
his
forces
poised
outside
the
city
for
street-to-street
combat
mattis
received
the
order
to
desist
bush
had
decided
to
have
american
commanders
work
with
local
leaders
to
create
an
all-iraqi
security
force
for
fallujah
i
believe
the
president's
goal
was
idealistic
and
tragically
mistaken
mattis
writes
based
on
misguided
assessments
that
appeared
impervious
to
my
reporting
much
of
the
general's
pushback
is
over
restrictive
rules
of
engagement
that
made
little
sense
to
him
there
are
some
jerks
in
the
world
that
need
to
be
shot
he
says
he
told
his
lads
patrolling
anbar
province
be
polite
be
professional
but
have
a
plan
to
kill
everyone
you
meet
the
book
reprises
other
unbridled
comments
by
mattis
you
go
into
afghanistan
you
got
guys
who
slap
women
around
for
five
years
because
they
didn't
wear
a
veil
he
recalls
telling
an
audience
of
sailors
marines
and
civilian
contractors
in
san
diego
in
you
know
guys
like
that
ain't
got
no
manhood
left
anyway
so
it's
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
fun
to
shoot
them
actually
it's
quite
fun
to
fight
them
it's
a
hell
of
a
hoot
it's
fun
to
shoot
some
people
i'll
be
right
up
there
with
you
i
like
brawling
the
remark
was
widely
reported
and
criticized
frankly
i
was
surprised
and
found
their
comments
bizarre
mattis
writes
of
his
critics
i
never
moderated
my
words
or
apologized
knowing
our
enemies
also
read
my
words
i
wanted
them
to
know
that
america
had
troops
who
were
not
tormented
about
fighting
people
who
murder
in
the
name
of
religion
or
deny
human
rights
to
others
mattis
was
investigated
in
by
a
u.s.
military
team
for
possible
murder
charges
after
he
ordered
an
airstrike
on
what
he
says
was
an
al-qaida
team
that
had
crossed
from
syria
into
iraq
his
team's
account
of
killing
insurgents
had
been
contradicted
by
the
guardian
which
published
a
report
alleging
that
women
and
children
had
been
the
ones
killed
because
the
gathering
was
actually
a
wedding
party
the
official
investigation
concluded
the
airstrike
mattis
ordered
had
in
fact
hit
a
war
camp
and
he
was
not
charged
but
by
then
it
was
too
late
he
laments
the
initial
false
reports
had
become
ground
truth
correcting
it
was
not
considered
news
we
had
once
again
lost
the
battle
of
the
narrative
no
administration
catches
more
flak
in
this
book
than
that
headed
by
obama
in
a
chapter
titled
snatching
defeat
from
the
jaws
of
victory
mattis
describes
a
losing
battle
as
head
of
the
u.s.
central
command
appointed
by
obama
in
to
keep
a
contingent
of
troops
in
iraq
beginning
with
president
bush
and
continuing
through
the
obama
administration
the
white
house
was
set
on
a
total
troop
withdrawal
for
political
reasons
he
writes
the
national
security
staff
put
no
stock
in
our
forecast
that
if
we
pulled
out
the
enemy
would
resurrect
a
visit
to
iraq
by
vice
president
joe
biden
in
the
summer
of
gets
mixed
reviews
from
mattis
he
quotes
a
teasing
question
biden
put
to
him
there
know
why
you're
at
centcom
biden
asks
him
because
no
one
else
was
dumb
enough
to
take
the
job
mattis
writes
he
found
biden
an
admirable
and
amiable
man
and
liked
him
but
the
vice
president
was
not
to
be
swayed
he
didn't
want
to
hear
more
he
wanted
our
forces
out
of
iraq
whatever
path
led
there
fastest
he
favored
mattis
writes
he
exuded
the
confidence
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
made
up
perhaps
even
indifferent
to
considering
the
consequences
were
he
judging
the
situation
incorrectly
when
obama
announced
in
that
u.s.
troops
were
being
withdrawn
from
iraq
his
assertion
that
we're
leaving
behind
a
sovereign
stable
and
self-reliant
iraq
rankled
his
military
commander
for
the
region
the
words
sovereign
stable
and
self-reliant
had
never
been
used
by
the
pentagon
or
the
state
department
mattis
writes
and
i
had
never
seen
them
in
any
intelligence
report
rhetoric
he
concludes
acidly
doesn't
end
conflicts
obama's
efforts
to
end
the
u.s.
fighting
in
afghanistan
fare
no
better
in
mattis
account
he
notes
that
while
obama
had
however
reluctantly
sent
an
additional
u.s.
forces
there
in
the
president
had
also
promised
those
troops
would
begin
to
come
home
after
months
my
thought
was
that
exiting
a
war
was
a
by-product
of
winning
that
war
mattis
writes
unless
you
want
to
lose
you
don't
tell
an
enemy
when
you
are
done
fighting
and
you
don't
set
an
exit
unrelated
to
the
situation
on
the
ground
things
went
downhill
from
there
at
a
meeting
with
then-defense
secretary
leon
panetta's
defense
policy
board
former
defense
secretary
james
schlesinger
asks
mattis
what
the
larger
strategy
is
behind
the
pentagon's
force
deployments
i
don't
know
what
our
integrated
strategy
is
mattis
recalls
responding
or
specifically
what
it
is
for
my
region
that
earned
him
a
chewing
out
from
a
high-ranking
dod
official
mattis
says
he
ignored
the
scolding
it
had
become
too
clear
that
i
was
supposed
to
sit
quietly
in
the
back
of
the
bus
as
it
careened
off
a
strategic
cliff
mattis
also
clashed
with
the
obama
administration
over
its
insistence
on
wanting
human
rights
to
be
the
singular
criterion
for
our
foreign
policy
a
stance
that
put
washington
at
odds
with
nations
mattis
considered
key
allies
among
them
saudi
arabia
egypt
and
the
united
arab
emirates
the
arab
monarchies
and
strongman
leaders
were
not
reforming
at
the
pace
our
human
rights
idealists
insisted
upon
mattis
writes
but
those
nations
that
had
stood
by
us
after
had
records
far
better
than
those
of
hostile
oppressive
regimes
like
iran
and
syria
it
was
mattis
enduring
enmity
toward
iran
that
abruptly
ended
his
tenure
as
centcom
commander
he
criticizes
the
obama
administration's
failure
to
respond
more
forcefully
to
a
failed
plot
to
bomb
a
georgetown
restaurant
where
saudi
arabia's
ambassador
would
be
dining
while
obama's
attorney
general
eric
holder
publicly
pointed
at
iran's
quds
force
as
being
behind
the
plot
we
treated
an
act
of
war
as
a
law
enforcement
violation
mattis
fumes
jailing
the
low-level
courier
late
in
mattis
writes
i
received
an
unauthorized
phone
call
telling
me
in
an
hour
the
pentagon
would
be
announcing
my
relief
he
did
not
go
gladly
i
was
leaving
a
region
aflame
and
in
disarray
he
writes
the
lack
of
an
integrated
regional
strategy
has
left
us
adrift
and
our
friends
confused
we
will
possibly
have
to
wait
for
another
administration
before
learning
mattis
thoughts
about
his
months
as
trump's
defense
secretary
but
he
lets
some
of
those
views
slip
toward
the
end
of
his
book
nations
with
allies
thrive
and
those
without
wither
he
writes
a
polemicist's
role
is
not
sufficient
for
a
leader
strategic
acumen
must
incorporate
a
fundamental
respect
for
other
nations
that
have
stood
with
us
as
trouble
loomed
a
parting
shot
perhaps
mattis
clearly
has
another
book
to
write
that
many
will
