former
vice
president
joe
biden
has
heavily
courted
union
votes
but
a
powerful
labor
union
in
his
campaign's
home
base
of
philadelphia
crucial
in
a
general
election
is
feeling
snubbed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
plays
up
his
pennsylvania
roots
as
much
as
anything
and
has
heavily
courted
organized
labor
in
his
presidential
campaign
but
a
key
union
in
biden's
backyard
is
feeling
neglected
by
the
leading
democratic
candidate
at
issue
is
a
forum
the
afl-cio's
philadelphia
branch
is
holding
sept
which
the
union
is
branding
a
workers
presidential
summit
seven
candidates
have
agreed
to
attend
so
far
including
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
billionaire
activist
tom
steyer
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
but
biden
is
not
among
them
he
always
calls
himself
a
pennsylvanian
at
heart
his
headquarters
are
here
in
philadelphia
but
his
folks
haven't
found
the
importance
of
coming
together
and
talking
to
our
workers
and
so
that's
very
disappointing
afl-cio
philadelphia
council
president
pat
eiding
told
npr
there's
got
to
be
some
respect
for
the
working
people
if
they
want
their
vote
the
member
union
is
a
key
political
player
in
the
most
important
democratic
region
of
what
could
be
the
most
important
swing
state
of
the
presidential
campaign
where
total
union
membership
in
was
about
over
of
the
state's
workforce
the
leadership
has
been
feeling
slighted
by
biden
since
the
opening
hours
of
his
presidential
run
the
day
he
announced
his
candidacy
in
a
video
biden
traveled
to
philadelphia
for
a
high-dollar
fundraiser
organized
by
david
l.
cohen
the
senior
executive
vice
president
of
comcast
biden
held
his
first
campaign
rally
at
a
pittsburgh
union
hall
three
days
later
but
eiding
and
his
members
were
annoyed
our
good
friend
joe
biden
from
down
the
road
a
bit
he
makes
his
announcement
in
philadelphia
eiding
said
first
place
he
goes
is
the
home
of
the
head
of
comcast
no
connection
with
labor
and
they
go
forward
and
it
was
a
little
disturbing
because
i
thought
well
here
we
go
again
eiding
like
many
labor
leaders
including
national
afl-cio
president
richard
trumka
faults
former
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton's
presidential
campaign
with
taking
union
support
for
granted
biden's
campaign
spokesman
andrew
bates
rejected
the
notion
that
biden
is
neglecting
labor
vice
president
biden
is
as
proud
to
call
patrick
eiding
a
friend
as
his
campaign
is
to
call
philadelphia
home
he
said
in
a
statement
shortly
after
he
received
the
endorsement
of
the
international
association
of
firefighters
the
very
first
rally
of
joe
biden's
campaign
was
held
at
a
teamsters
hall
in
pittsburgh
where
he
shouted-out
the
unions
represented
in
the
audience
joe
biden
has
fought
for
working
people
his
entire
life
and
as
he
said
at
his
official
campaign
launch
in
philadelphia
as
president
he
would
strive
every
day
to
build
an
economy
that
rewards
work
not
just
wealth
biden
has
attended
several
labor-focused
candidate
forums
including
recent
events
in
iowa
and
las
vegas
biden
allies
in
pennsylvania
politics
attribute
the
forum
snub
to
scheduling
conflicts
though
the
biden
campaign
doesn't
deny
that
it
has
strategically
avoided
several
multiple-candidate
forums
in
an
apparent
effort
to
maintain
the
former
vice
president's
image
as
an
above-the-fray
front-runner
still
a
group
that
should
be
a
key
ally
is
upset
and
eiding
has
made
it
clear
he
thinks
the
afl-cio's
statewide
chapter
should
hold
off
on
endorsing
biden
or
any
other
democratic
candidate
for
now
if
he
ends
up
as
the
democratic
nominee
biden
will
need
strong
labor
support
in
southeastern
pennsylvania
democrats
traditionally
carry
the
state
by
running
up
their
margins
in
philadelphia
and
the
surrounding
suburbs
clinton's
net
philadelphia
vote
total
in
was
about
votes
smaller
than
former
president
barack
obama's
margin
a
difference
that
accounted
for
about
half
of
president
trump's
narrow
statewide
victory
many
factors
contributed
to
that
including
lower
enthusiasm
among
african
american
voters
but
study
after
study
showed
trump
did
better
among
union
members
than
most
recent
republican
presidential
candidates
and
eiding
says
labor
in
philadelphia
moves
the
vote
biden's
going
to
have
to
decide
to
what
extent
he's
got
to
reach
out
said
terry
madonna
a
longtime
pennsylvania
political
observer
and
pollster
who
runs
the
center
for
politics
and
public
affairs
at
franklin
and
marshall
college
my
sense
is
if
he
reaches
out
properly
i
think
he
can
heal
those
wounds
madonna
argues
biden
is
a
natural
ally
for
most
labor
groups
but
points
out
that
bernie
sanders
has
really
made
appeals
to
labor
sanders
has
visited
several
picket
lines
and
union
rallies
this
year
including
an
appearance
last
month
protesting
the
closure
of
a
philadelphia
hospital
his
campaign
says
it
has
sent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
emails
and
a
half-million
texts
to
supporters
urging
them
to
participate
in
strikes
and
other
union
actions
it's
something
eiding
made
a
point
to
raise
noting
in
the
interview
that
senator
sanders
certainly
sees
philadelphia
as
important
enough
to
talk
here
