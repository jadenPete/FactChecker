marjorie

of

anthony
list
and

have
argued
that
no
tax
dollars
should
go
to
organizations
that
have
any
involvement
with
abortion
in
a
statement
to
npr
on
wednesday
afternoon
a
department
of
health
and
human
services
spokesperson
wrote
to
the
extent
that
planned
parenthood
claims
that
it
must
make
burdensome
changes
to
comply
with
the
final
rule
it
is
actually
choosing
to
place
a
higher
priority
on
the
ability
to
refer
for
abortion
instead
of
continuing
to
receive
federal
funds
to
provide
a
broad
range
of
acceptable
and
effective
family
planning
methods
and
services
to
clients
in
need
of
these
services
critics
call
the
trump
administration
regulations
a
gag
rule
imagine
if
you
show
up
as
a
patient
to
a
health
center
and
the
doctor's
only
ability
is
to
refer
you
to
prenatal
care
and
you
may
have
already
decided
that
you
want
to
have
an
abortion
mcgill
johnson
said
federal
regulations
will
ban
that
doctor
from
actually
giving
you
advice
and
referring
you
to
abortion
planned
parenthood's
withdrawal
from
title
x
would
mark
a
major
shift
for
the
program
the
group
has
been
involved
since
title
x's
creation
in
the
early
s
and
its
affiliates
serve
about
percent
of
recipients
nationwide
officials
say
over
time
title
x
has
grown
from
a
million
program
in
to
more
than
million
this
year
federal
funding
for
abortion
already
is
prohibited
in
most
cases
but
the
new
rules
issued
by
health
and
human
services
this
year
forbid
any
group
involved
in
providing
abortions
or
counseling
patients
about
them
to
receive
title
x
funding
to
pay
for
other
services
such
as
contraception
and
health
screenings

officials
say
they
had
been
holding
out
hope
that
a
federal
court
would
intervene
or
that
congress
would
act
to
preserve
their
funding
a
spending
packaged
passed
by
the
democratic-controlled
house
in
june
included
language
reversing
the
trump
administration
rule
that
language
would
have
faced
formidable
odds
in
the
republican-led
senate
but
in
light
of
new
guidance
sent
to
grantees
by
health
and
human
services
in
recent
days
officials
say
they
will
be
forced
out
of

said
it

at
