on

in
guatemala's
presidential
elections
guatemalans
have
chosen
alejandro
giammattei
a
conservative
who
once
led
the
country's
prison
system
to
be
their
next
president
voter
turnout
in
the
runoff
was
low
on
sunday
in
the
small
central
american
country
preliminary
results
showed
giammattei
won
nearly
of
the
vote
and
that
fewer
than
half
of
eligible
guatemalans
had
cast
ballots
according
to
the
country's
electoral
tribunal
a
year-old
surgeon
giammattei
tried
three
times
previously
to
become
president
before
succeeding
on
his
fourth
attempt
he
campaigned
on
a
promise
to
fight
crime
and
build
a
permanent
political
force
with
a
deep
love
for
god
family
and
guatemala
with
his
vamos
political
party
when
he
takes
office
on
jan
giammattei
will
face
a
range
of
serious
issues
that
include
rampant
corruption
widespread
poverty
and
unemployment
he
will
also
need
to
negotiate
with
president
trump
who
last
month
threatened
to
impose
a
travel
ban
tariffs
on
exports
and
taxes
on
migrants
remittances
if
guatemala
did
not
comply
with
his
immigration
ambitions
the
trump
administration
wants
to
reduce
the
numbers
of
migrants
at
the
southern
border
by
shifting
the
burden
to
central
american
countries
from
which
many
migrants
have
fled
the
administration
expected
guatemala
to
become
a
safe
third-party
country
which
would
require
migrants
who
travel
through
guatemala
to
request
asylum
there
instead
of
seeking
protection
in
the
united
states
the
deal
was
unpopular
in
guatemala
and
a
high
court
blocked
the
country's
president
jimmy
morales
from
signing
the
agreement
last
month
morales
blamed
the
court
for
harming
his
good
relationship
with
washington

himself
as
ready
for
the
job

carrie
kahn
on
sunday
as
he
addressed
reporters
moments

the
winner
giammattei
told
reuters
he
hoped
to
modify
the
migration
deal
with
the
united
states
i
hope
that
during
this
transition
the
doors
will
open
to
get
more
information
so
we
can
see
what
from
a
diplomatic
point
of
view
we
can
do
to
remove
from
this
deal
the
things
that
are
not
right
for
us
or
how
we
can
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
united
states
he
said
if
we
don't
have
the
capacity
to
look
after
our
own
people
imagine
what
it
will
be
like
for
foreigners

in
guatemala
the
case
against
him
was
eventually
dismissed
he
announced
in
the
spring
that
he
was
taking
legal
action
against
the
organization
which
had
steadily
earned
the
trust
of
guatemalans
by
investigating
military
and
government
elites
for
stealing
public
funds
last
year
morales
announced
that
he

uncertainty
about
what
comes
next
with
giammattei
at
the
country's
helm
really
the
future
is
in
his
hands
and
we
don't
know
exactly
what
he's
going
to
do
she
said
that's
really
scary

must
improve
its
diplomatic
relations
with
the
united

we
have
a
lot
to
lose

relationship
with
the
