completed
a
three-week
course
of
stereotactic
ablative
radiation

center
in
new
york
city
a
statement
from
the
supreme
court
read
the
focused
radiation
treatment
began
on
august
and
was
administered
on
an
outpatient
basis
to
treat
a
tumor
on
her
pancreas
the
abnormality
was
first
detected
after
a
routine
blood
test
in
early
july
and
a
biopsy
performed
on
july
at
sloan
kettering
confirmed
a
localized
malignant
tumor
as
part
of
her
treatment
a
bile
duct
stent
was
placed
the
justice
tolerated
treatment
well
she
cancelled
her
annual
summer
visit
to
santa
fe
but
has
otherwise
maintained
an
active
schedule
the
tumor
was
treated
definitively
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
disease
elsewhere
in
the
body
justice
ginsburg
will
continue
to
have
periodic
blood
tests
and
scans
no
further
treatment
is
needed
at
this
time
the
supreme
court's
statement
refers
to
a
stereotactic
ablative
radiation
dr
timothy
cannon
a
gastrointestinal
oncology
specialist
at
inova
schar
cancer
institute
in
virginia
who
was
not
involved
in
ginsburg's
treatment
said
that
is
the
cutting-edge
new
cancer
treatment
but
it
is
not
a
cure
for
a
pancreatic
mass
the
statement
from
the
court
does
not
say
what
type
of
tumor
it
is
the
mystery
is
what
kind
of
cancer
this
is
cannon
said
is
it
a
slow-growing
metastases
of
her
lung
cancer
is
it
a
recurrence
of
her
pancreatic
cancer
from
years
ago
or
is
it
a
new
cancer
in
someone
predisposed
to
getting
cancer
as
he
left
for
the
g-
meeting
in
france
president
trump
said
of
the
justice
our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
her
we
wish
her
well
she's
strong
she's
tough
she's
pulled
through
a
lot
shortly
before
her
new
round
of
treatment
ginsburg
sat
for
an
interview
with
npr
and
her
resilience
was
on
full
display
there
was
a
senator
i
think
it
was
after
my
pancreatic
cancer
who
announced
with
great
glee
that
i
was
going
to
be
dead
within
six
months
ginsburg
said
that
senator
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
is
now
himself
dead
and
i
she
added
with
a
smile
am
very
much
alive
during
ginsburg's
three
weeks
of
treatment
in
new
york
she
kept
up
a
busy
schedule
in
new
york
often
going
out
in
the
evening
to
the
movies
the
opera
and
the
theater
at
the
off-broadway
theater
stage
where
fiddler
on
the
roof
is
playing
word
spread
during
intermission
that
ginsburg
was
there
and
the
audience
stood
for
several
minutes
applauding
the
diminutive
justice
also
in
the
audience
that
night
was
kate
mckinnon
whose
frequent
portrayal
of
ginsburg
on
nbc's
saturday
night
live
has
become
a
marquee
event
on
the
show
soon
the
justice
and
her
imitator
were
caught
in
photos
clasping
hands
for
the
first
time
the
justice
also
continued
to
work
during
her
time
in
new
york
according
to
court
sources
and
she
has
been
spotted
frequently
window
shopping
even
going
in
to
try
on
shoes
and
other
items
that
have
interested
her
ginsburg
has
public
events
planned
for
september
and
has
not
canceled
any
of
them
to
date
the
supreme
court
is
set
to
open
a
new
term
on
the
first
monday
in
october
and
the
justices
routinely
return
to
work
in
september
president
trump
has
already
named
two
conservative
justices
to
the
court
thus
ensuring
a
five-justice
conservative
majority
in
most
controversial
cases
were
ginsburg
to
leave
the
court
prior
to
the
election
or
even
the
inauguration
senate
republican
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
made
clear
the
gop
would
move
immediately
to
fill
the
vacancy
that
would
ensure
a
to-
conservative
majority
on
the
court
all
but
guaranteeing
a
conservative
grip
on
the
court
for
decades
to
come
