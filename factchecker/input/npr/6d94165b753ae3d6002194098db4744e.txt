it's

horner
a
republican
is
shaping
democracy
and
generally
having
a
ball
it's
like
a
video
game
the
senator
exclaims
as
another
chunk
of
voters
moves
into
the
swath
that
he
represents
north
carolina's
th
senate
district
he's
moving
the
voters
in
an
effort
to
make
the
district
as
compact
as
possible
it
is
sort
of
like
a
video
game
the
staffer
laughs
as
he
moves
the
mouse
but
with
much
larger
consequences
horner
along
with
the
rest
of
north
carolina's
legislature
has
spent
the
past
two
weeks
in
the
midst
of
a
massive
undertaking
remaking
the
state's
house
and
senate
districts
after
a
three-judge
panel
in
state
court
unanimously
found
that
the
previous
maps
were
unconstitutional
the
court
order
said
the
old
maps
violated
citizens
right
to
fair
elections
because
republicans
who
control
the
state
legislature
drew
them
for
explicit
partisan
gain
in
the
maps
helped
republicans
win
of
seats
in
the
state
senate
and
of
seats
in
the
house
despite
receiving
less
than
half
of
the
overall
vote
the
court's
ruling
was
the
first
such
victory
in
a
state
court
for
anti-gerrymandering
advocates
since
the
u.s.
supreme
court
ruled
this
year
that
extreme
partisanship
in
the
drawing
of
districts
isn't
up
to
federal
courts
to
police
the
result
means
lawmakers
here
in
one
of
the
most
polarized
state
capitals
in
the
u.s.
are
tasked
with
redrawing
the
lines
without
basing
those
lines
on
whom
voters
are
likely
to
support
with
a
wednesday
deadline
fast
approaching
it's
a
process
that
could
have
massive
implications
statewide
and
nationally
in
north
carolina
elections
are
often
decided
by
razor-thin
margins
last
week
a
special
election
for
the
state's
th
congressional
district
was
decided
by
fewer
than
votes
closely
divided
states
are
where
partisans
can
gain
the
most
by
committing
a
gerrymander
wrote
sam
wang
the
leader
of
the
princeton
gerrymandering
project
in
his
analysis
of
the
new
house
map
that
north
carolina
looks
likely
to
approve
nationally
the
process
could
offer
a
preview
of
the
next
round
of
redistricting
across
the
country
to
come
after
the
elections
and
census
experts
say
voters
understand
redistricting
in
a
way
they
didn't
after
the
elections
and
that
may
lead
to
demands
for
more
transparency
and
less
partisanship
in
a
process
that
takes
place
once
every
years
a
number
of
states
passed
laws
in
to
amend
how
the
process
works
going
forward
most
transparent
redistricting
process
in
history
in
their
decision
this
month
three
superior
court
judges
in
wake
county
ruled
that
all
aspects
of
the
mapmaking
process
need
to
be
public
a
clear
rebuke
of
the
backroom
conversations
through
which
redistricting
negotiations
traditionally
are
conducted

that
lawmakers
worked

in

the

dan

a

released
a
statement
calling
the
week
the
most
transparent
redistricting
process
in
history
the
full
legislature
is
slated
to
vote
on
the
senate
maps
on
monday
night
after
a
public
comment
period
in
the
afternoon
the
maps
produced
in
this
room
in
the
last
several
days
are
fair
and
nonpartisan
the
lawmakers
said
on
the
house
side
lawmakers
ran
into
more
issues
the
body
voted
to
pass
the
maps
friday
night
but
a
number
of
democrats
cried
foul
saying
republicans
made
unnecessary
changes
for
political
gain
the
senate
is
also
slated
to
vote
on

maps
on
monday
partisan
mistrust
despite
the
assertions
of
senate
leaders
there
remains
some
skepticism
about
whether
the
court
will
agree
to
enact
the
maps

approves
stanford
university
professor
and
election
law
expert
nathaniel
persily
was
appointed
friday
to
help
the
court
review
the
maps
and
help
draw
new
maps
if
the
general
assembly's
lines
are
deemed
unlawful
i
would
be
surprised
if
this
court
accepts
the
maps
that
this
general
assembly
develops
said
freshman
democrat
sen
michael
garrett
i
think
the
behavior
of
this
body
and
the
nearly
decade
of
gamesmanship
that's
gone
on
there's
just
too
much
mistrust
that
mistrust
has
been
amplified
in
recent
months
with
the
unearthing
of
files
from
longtime
republican
strategist
thomas
hofeller
who
died
in
hofeller
was
thought
of
as
something
of
a
gerrymandering
wizard
and
the
files
which
have
been
reviewed
by
the
new
yorker
and
the
new
york
times
added
new
details
about
his
involvement
in
helping
north
carolina
lawmakers
draw
the
maps
to
such
a
republican
advantage
in
may
after
receiving
news
that
he
had
cancer
hofeller
wrote
an
email
to
a
friend
according
to
the
new
yorker
that
read
i
still
have
time
to
bedevil
the
democrats
with
more
redistricting
plans
before
i
exit
look
my
name
up
on
the
internet
and
you
can
follow
the
damage
last
week
republicans
tried
to
address
some
of
the
doubts
that
they
would
adhere
to
the
nonpartisan
rules
set
by
the
court
rather
than
draw
new
maps
from
scratch
they
picked
base
maps
from
models
created
by
university
of
michigan
professor
jowei
chen
who
actually
testified
against
them
in
the
court
case
that
invalidated
the
maps
a
state
lottery
machine
was
brought
in
to
randomly
select
from
a
subset
of
those
maps
but
an
analysis
done
by
wang
of
the
princeton
gerrymandering
project
found
that
the
house
map
still
contained
between
one-half
and
two-thirds
of
the
partisan
advantage
that
was
present
in
the
illegal
gerrymander
to
make
an
analogy
to
card
games
a
stacked
deck
can't
produce
a
fair
deal
wang
wrote
and
i
have
some
questions
about
the
deck
the
whole
process
took
place
against
a
backdrop
of
extreme
divide
and
tension
last
week
that
culminated
on
wednesday
when
republicans
sprang
a
surprise
vote
on
democrats
that
had
lawmakers
screaming
at
each
other
on
the
house
floor
later
that
day
a
democratic
senator
grabbed
a
reporter's
phone
and
threw
it
and
all
week
accusations
flew
about
maps
being
drawn
in
secret
and
violations
of
the
court
order
it
is
a
very
intense
very
partisan
very
polarized
environment
that
the
state
has
been
going
through
since
really
said
j.
michael
bitzer
a
political
scientist
at
catawba
college
in
north
carolina
whether
voters
are
happy
at
the
end
of
this
round
of
redistricting
bitzer
said
probably
won't
be
determined
by
what
the
maps
look
like
or
how
transparent
the
process
is
but
by
the
election
results
in
if
your
party
loses
or
doesn't
have
control
of
one
of
the
two
chambers
then
you
will
continue
to
say
this
is
a
rigged
system
bitzer
said
