and

david
koch
who
built
one
of
the
nation's
largest
private
businesses
with
his
brother
charles
and
pumped
money
into
conservative
groups
to
help
reshape
american
politics
has
died
charles
koch
confirmed
the
news
in
a
statement
on
friday
that
referenced
david's
long-running
ailment
twenty-seven
years
ago
david
was
diagnosed
with
advanced
prostate
cancer
and
given
a
grim
prognosis
of
a
few
years
to
live
david
liked
to
say
that
a
combination
of
brilliant
doctors
state-of-the-art
medications
and
his
own
stubbornness
kept
the
cancer
at
bay
we
can
all
be
grateful
that
it
did
because
he
was
able
to
touch
so
many
more
lives
as
a
result
charles
koch
wrote
no
precise
cause
was
given
for
david
koch's
death
he
was
david
koch
helped
his
brother
charles
build
koch
industries
into
a
behemoth
that
incorporates
brands
such
as
georgia
pacific
plywood
the
company
is
one
of
the
biggest
ethanol
producers
in
the
country
its
cordura
cloth
is
used
to
make
military
uniforms
and
equipment
the
two
brothers
also
created
the
koch
political
network
famous
and
infamous
for
its
secret
funding
and
fiercely
negative
advertising
which
often
aimed
at
president
barack
obama
and
other
democrats
their
group
americans
for
prosperity
was
funded
with
koch
brothers
money
as
well
as
contributions
from
other
rich
donors
they
recruited
and
although
david
denied
giving
money
to
tea
party
candidates
in
the
brothers
efforts
helped
republicans
win
a
net
gain
of
seats
in
the
house
the
koch
network
also
had
groups
aimed
at
veterans
women
seniors
and
latinos
ostensibly
nonpolitical
the
groups
exploited
a
lack
of
transparency
under
u.s.
law
weak
enforcement
by
the
irs
and
openings
created
by
supreme
court
decisions
the
system
was
part
of
what
was
called
a
stream
of
dark
money
by
its
critics
so
called
because
it
could
be
unclear
who
was
bankrolling
which
causes
for
as
much
energy
as
the
koch
network
expended
against
democrats
since
the
turn
of
the
st
century
the
brothers
did
not
support
donald
trump
in
leading
to
fissures
within
the
conservative
donor
world
trump
responded
by
slamming
what
he
called
the
globalist
koch
brothers
and
vowing
to
pursue
the
tariffs
and
immigration
crackdowns
they
opposed
robin
and
batman
the
koch
network
amassed
as
much
clout
as
the
republican
national
committee
or
perhaps
even
more
all
the
same
david
koch
was
not
a
doctrinaire
republican
in
he
was
the
libertarian
nominee
for
vice
president
and
although
the
brothers
network
backed
conservative
lawmakers
who
opposed
abortion
access
and
gay
rights
koch
supported
them
i'm
a
social
liberal
koch
told
abc's
barbara
walters
in
he
also
was
a
fiscal
hawk
and
outlined
one
of
his
core
concerns
in
that
interview
i'm
very
worried
that
if
the
budget
is
not
balanced
that
inflation
could
occur
and
the
economy
of
our
country
could
suffer
terribly
he
said
david
koch
and
his
three
brothers
grew
up
in
wichita
kan
sons
of
oil
industry
tycoon
fred
koch
charles
and
david
eventually
became
co-owners
of
koch
industries
charles
ran
the
company
but
david
stayed
involved
even
after
he
moved
to
new
york
city
he
was
a
fixture
on
the
manhattan
social
scene
and
a
major
donor
to
the
city's
cultural
institutions
including
the
david
h.
koch
theater
at
lincoln
center
and
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
daniel
schulman
author
of
sons
of
wichita
how
the
koch
brothers
became
america's
most
powerful
and
private
dynasty
told
npr
that
david
koch
often
was
the
follower
and
charles
the
leader
david
koch
has
always
been
the
robin
to
charles
koch's
batman
more
or
less
the
sidekick
schulman
said
up
into
his
late
s
maybe
even
early
s
schulman
said
david
was
kind
of
living
this
new
york
socialite
playboy
lifestyle
and
he
loved
that
sort
of
thing
in
koch
was
aboard
an
airliner
that
collided
with
another
aircraft
on
a
runway
at
los
angeles
international
airport
more
than
people
died
and
koch
barely
escaped
as
he
later
told
barbara
walters
i
felt
the
good
lord
was
sitting
on
my
shoulder
the
year
following
the
plane
crash
he
was
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
the
philanthropist
koch
turned
to
philanthropy
giving
mainly
to
causes
he
was
familiar
with
including
medical
research
the
arts
and
museums
in
he
recounted
how
he
persuaded
his
alma
mater
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
to
build
a
center
to
research
prostate
cancer
with
tears
running
down
my
face
i
begged
the
mit
corporation
to
commit
to
this
essential
project
i
was
treated
to
a
standing
ovation
he
said
koch
left
politics
and
koch
industries
in
citing
unspecified
health
issues
