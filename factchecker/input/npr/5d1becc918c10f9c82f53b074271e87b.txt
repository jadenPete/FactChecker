u.s.
farmers
who
have
been
hard
hit
by
president
trump's
trade
wars
got
some
relief
wednesday
when
trump
signed
an
interim
trade
deal
with
japan
the
agreement
calls
for
lower
japanese
tariffs
on
u.s.
farm
exports
such
as
beef
and
pork
it
also
locks
in
tariff-free
digital
commerce
but
it
does
not
address
the
president's
threat
to
level
punishing
tariffs
on
imported
cars
from
japan
a
top
trade
negotiator
says
trump
has
no
plans
to
act
on
that
threat
for
now
trump
signed
the
partial
trade
agreement
along
with
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
in
new
york
where
the
two
men
are
attending
the
united
nations
general
assembly
it's
a
tremendous
trade
deal
trump
told
reporters
it's
a
very
big
trade
deal
the
partial
agreement
is
scheduled
to
take
effect
in
january
with
negotiations
on
a
larger
trade
deal
beginning
four
months
later
trump
was
flanked
by
american
farmers
and
ranchers
whose
exports
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
president's
hard-edged
trade
policies
china
in
particular
has
curtailed
its
purchases
of
pork
and
soybeans
putting
downward
pressure
on
prices
what
we
need
in
the
future
is
more
agreements
like
this
all
around
the
world
said
zippy
duvall
president
of
the
american
farm
bureau
federation
what
we
need
is
trade
that's
what
makes
rural
america
grow
u.s.
beef
and
pork
producers
have
been
at
a
disadvantage
in
japan
after
trump
withdrew
from
the
trans-pacific
partnership
a
nation
deal
negotiated
during
the
obama
administration
the
other
countries
went
ahead
with
that
agreement
giving
competitors
such
as
australia
and
new
zealand
preferential
access
to
the
japanese
market
once
implemented
the
agreement
signed
today
puts
u.s.
pork
back
on
a
level
playing
field
with
our
competitors
in
japan
said
david
herring
a
hog
farmer
from
north
carolina
who
leads
the
national
pork
producers
council
the
advocacy
group
farmers
for
free
trade
also
praised
the
agreement
with
japan
as
a
step
in
the
right
direction
our
farmers
need
trade
wins
not
trade
wars
the
group
said
in
a
statement
we
hope
this
new
agreement
leads
to
more
wins
as
well
as
progress
in
achieving
a
better
trade
relationship
with
china
the
agreement
also
guarantees
that
digital
commerce
between
the
u.s.
and
japan
can
flow
freely
without
tariffs
or
other
trade
barriers
what
we've
really
done
is
lock
in
the
best
possible
standards
you
can
have
said
u.s.
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
while
the
farm
provisions
affect
a
powerful
political
constituency
the
digital
agreement
may
have
more
lasting
impact
on
the
u.s.
economy
digital
is
the
big
growth
area
in
world
commerce
today
said
gary
hufbauer
a
senior
fellow
at
the
peterson
institute
for
international
economics
the
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
said
the
deal
would
give
a
lift
to
economies
on
both
sides
of
the
pacific
but
cautioned
that
the
partial
agreement
doesn't
go
far
enough
a
comprehensive
trade
deal
with
japan
would
provide
some
much-needed
predictability
not
only
for
the
u.s.
and
japan
but
for
all
our
trade
allies
myron
brilliant
the
chamber's
executive
vice
president
said
in
a
statement
benefits
for
japan
in
the
partial
agreement
include
lower
tariffs
on
some
exports
such
as
machine
tools
bicycles
and
musical
instruments
japan
wanted
a
commitment
from
the
u.s.
that
trump
would
not
impose
tariffs
on
japanese
cars
which
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
one
of
the
country's
major
industries
the
agreement
does
not
make
any
guarantee
on
auto
tariffs
but
lighthizer
did
offer
japan
some
reassurance
at
this
point
it
certainly
is
not
our
intention
the
president's
intention
to
do
anything
on
autos
with
respect
to
japan
lighthizer
told
reporters
