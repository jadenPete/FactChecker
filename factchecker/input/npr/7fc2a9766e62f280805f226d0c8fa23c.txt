thursday

after

voted
down

members

sunrise

interrupted
the
meeting
by
standing
on
their
chairs
and
singing
a
version
of
the
song
which
side
are
you
on
they
then
walked
out
amid
a
rise
in
extreme
weather
events
and
increasingly
dire
scientific
reports
climate
change
has
already
received
more
attention
than
in
all
debates
combined
in
the
last
presidential
election
but
sunrise
activists
are
among
those
who
think
it
deserves
even
more
the
climate
crisis
is
an
emergency
and
we
need
the
dnc
to
start
acting
like
it
says
nicole
karsch
action
lead
for
the
sunrise
movement
in
philadelphia
at
a
recent
protest
the
group
staged
there
a
few
dozen
young
people
held
yellow
and
black
signs
calling
for
a
climate
debate
their
focus
was
a
building
where
they
thought
pennsylvania's
democratic
party
had
an
office
protesters
staged
a
sit-in
in
the
building
lobby
police
arrested
people
and
led
them
out
to
a
van
in
plastic
handcuffs
the
group
says
the
activists
were
released
a
short
time
later
there
was
a
hitch
though
there
is
no
democratic
party
office
in
that
building
sunrise
organizers
say
they
got
bad
information

if
you
can't
figure
out
where
the

offices
are
before
you
show
up
for
the
protest
i'm
not
sure
that
i
trust
your
analysis
of
the
climate
science
much
less
what
to
actually
do
about
the
problem
says
ted
nordhaus
founder
and
executive
director
of
the
breakthrough
institute
nordhaus
has
been
critical
of
environmental
groups
that
focus
much
of
their
work
on
opposing
fossil
fuels
his
group
instead
looks
to
technological
solutions
including
nuclear
energy
to
address
climate
change
still
the
sunrise
movement
has
been
effective
at
getting
media
coverage
it
made
a
splash
last
november
when
the
group's
activists
occupied
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
office
and
drew
high-profile
support
from
newly-elected
representative
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
the
sunrise
movement
comes
at
just
a
perfect
moment
for
them
to
get
a
lot
of
attention
says
anthony
leiserowitz
director
of
the
yale
program
on
climate
change
communication
leiserowitz
says
more
americans
see
climate
change
as
something
that
is
happening
now
and
harming
people
at
the
same
time
he
says
the
most
liberal
democratic
voters
the
party's
base
rank
the
environment
and
climate
change
as
their
top
issues
behind
only
healthcare
that's
never
been
the
case
for
either
political
party
in
american
history
where
climate
change
was
truly
one
of
the
top
priority
voting
issues
he
says
now
nearly
every
democratic
presidential
candidate
has
a
detailed
climate
change
plan
and
most
say
they
support
the
green
new
deal
which
has
been
a
specific
focus
for
the
sunrise
movement
on
thursday
bernie
sanders
released
his
climate
plan
calling
for
a
whopping
trillion
to
pay
for
it
multiple
times
what
other
candidates
have
proposed
in
general
the
green
new
deal
would
speed
the
country's
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
it
also
aims
to
remake
the
economy
by
guaranteeing
people
good
paying
jobs
and
healthcare
a
main
goal
will
be
electing
candidates
to
office
who
are
green
new
deal
champions
in
the
house
and
the
senate
and
supporting
democrats
to
win
elections
says
sunrise
co-founder
and
executive
director
varshini
prakash
the
group
plans
to
register
thousands
of
voters
especially
young
voters
who
are
more
likely
to
vote
democratic
and
to
make
sure
they
cast
ballots
next
november
prakash
says
organizers
will
focus
on
key
swing
states
including
michigan
and
pennsylvania
and
we
will
also
be
supporting
whoever
the
presidential
candidate
is
to
defeat
trump
she
says
first
sunrise
leaders
have
to
maintain
momentum
and
they
plan
to
do
that
by
building
an
activist
infrastructure
that
includes
so-called
movement
houses
where
activists
live
eat
and
work
together
sunrise

has
so-called
movement
houses
in
key
swing
states
like
pennsylvania
and
michigan
activists
live
work

for

though
the

is
focused

its
campaign
for
a

democratic
party
chair
tom
perez
has
resisted
the
idea
in
an
opinion
piece
in
june
he
said
guidelines
for
the
debates
were
established
early
and
changing
them
now
wouldn't
be
fair
to
people
who
have
requested
single-subject
debates
on
other
topics
still
perez
wrote
i
made
clear
to
our
media
partners
that
the
issue
of
climate
change
must
be
featured
prominently
in
our
debates
that
didn't
happen
in
and
it
was
wrong
even
though
the
democratic
party
has
rejected
the
sunrise
movement's
request
for
a
climate
debate
cnn
plans
to
hold
a
climate

town
hall
with
candidates
next

the
georgetown
institute
of

service
also
plans
to
hold
a

forum
with

that
will
air
on

a
