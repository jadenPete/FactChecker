thursday's
debate
in
houston
there
was
something
different
about
the
democratic
debate
this
week
compared
with
the
earlier
rounds
this
summer
something
was
happening
that
was
hard
to
pin
down
but
it
was
palpable
not
the
contrast
of
night
and
day
but
perhaps
the
difference
between
dusk
and
dawn
it's
a
critical
difference
and
it
comes
at
a
crucial
time
because
the
trump
presidency
these
candidates
are
competing
to
truncate
has
reached
what
may
be
a
critical
juncture
but
more
of
that
in
a
moment
this
week
the
democratic
nomination
fight
once
again
took
the
form
of
a
tv
quiz
show
with
too
many
contestants
to
fit
onscreen
at
once
once
again
the
candidates
sounded
a
lot
alike
peddling
much
the
same
wares
as
in
june
and
july
and
yes
three
hours
was
too
long
yet
something
different
happened
the
debate
left
a
clearer
imprint
the
effect
was
at
least
somewhat
more
energizing
than
the
summer
meetings
or
perhaps
just
a
bit
less
dispiriting
there
were
still
candidates
onstage
but
at
least
they
were
the
candidates
most
people
wanted
to
see
and
best
of
all
there
was
not
the
prospect
of
more
contestants
doing
it
all
over
on
the
following
night
that
made
a
difference
the
earlier
affairs
had
the
feel
of
the
nfl
exhibition
season
this
week
felt
more
like
playing
for
keeps
on
the
substantive
side
the
candidate's
answers
and
thoughts
seemed
more
fully
formed
and
more
clearly
expressed
some
of
this
is
just
practice
some
of
these
candidates
are
new
to
the
big
leagues
and
veterans
such
as
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
bernie
sanders
are
getting
used
to
new
roles
some
of
the
upgrade
also
seemed
attributable
to
the
abc
moderators
all
four
of
whom
were
crisp
they
had
challenging
questions
and
they
probed
in
their
follow-ups
but
they
did
not
intrude
on
the
dynamic
among
the
candidates
like
good
referees
they
pretty
much
let
the
players
play
to
the
benefit
of
all
benefiting
most
were
the
candidates
who
got
the
most
airtime
biden
sanders
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
much
was
made
of
it
being
the
first
time
that
viewers
had
a
chance
to
see
biden
and
warren
face
off
with
sanders
the
other
candidate
consistently
in
double
digits
right
there
as
well
it
gave
democratic
consumers
their
best
chance
for
a
taste
test
to
date
among
the
three
warren
seemed
to
make
the
most
of
it
she
had
the
freshest
energy
onstage
and
she
is
getting
better
at
pressing
a
point
her
share
of
the
airtime
this
week
was
nearly
minutes
second
to
biden
but
only
by
a
few
seconds
and
she
was
showing
passion
on
a
range
of
outrages
rather
than
intellectual
irritation
at
the
way
things
are
she
also
responded
to
questions
and
to
the
answers
of
her
rivals
with
apparent
spontaneity
even
when
she
was
recycling
what
might
have
been
a
practiced
response
most
observers
gave
biden
the
putative
front-runner
middling
marks
for
some
he
was
just
ok
a
left-handed
compliment
at
best
for
others
he
was
good
enough
which
isn't
much
better
all
seemed
to
agree
he
wasn't
bad
it's
hard
to
know
how
biden
soon
to
be
would
look
to
the
democratic
electorate
based
solely
on
this
debate
performance
given
how
long
he
has
been
around
even
more
of
a
factor
is
the
defensiveness
many
democrats
feel
about
the
guy
they
still
think
has
the
best
chance
of
beating
president
trump
but
more
of
that
in
a
moment
sanders
who
is
already
came
across
as
every
bit
his
age
and
just
as
irascible
as
he
was
at
just
and
challenging
hillary
clinton
for
the
last
presidential
nomination
he
once
again
made
a
strong
case
for
the
national
health
care
system
he
calls
medicare
for
all
a
concept
that
now
gets
at
least
lip
service
from
many
of
his
rivals
as
well
as
pushback
from
a
few
even
though
sanders
goal
is
to
make
the
famous
health
program
available
to
everybody
it
is
for
now
still
primarily
associated
with
old
folks
it's
likely
to
be
the
democratic
party
vehicle
for
getting
to
national
health
care
sooner
or
later
so
it
could
use
and
likely
will
have
more
age-appropriate
champions
still
it
was
biden's
age
that
was
called
into
question
in
this
debate
when
he
had
talked
about
who
would
qualify
under
his
amendments
to
obamacare
juli
n
castro
at
one
end
of
the
stage
objected
to
what
sounded
like
biden
contradicting
himself
when
biden
interrupted
with
a
denial
castro
fired
back
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
minutes
ago
without
that
word
already
that
question
might
have
stood
on
its
own
instead
it
seemed
a
shot
at
biden's
age
and
past
lapses
of
memory
the
audience
reacted
with
a
mix
of
groans
and
applause
they
took
it
as
a
shot
and
it
played
as
such
endlessly
on
broadcast
highlights
and
in
panel
post-mortems
castro
may
have
been
the
victim
of
his
own
need
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
pack
a
problem
shared
by
all
but
the
three
candidates
at
center
stage
he
was
anchoring
the
end
of
the
lineup
because
his
polls
and
fundraising
are
barely
meeting
the
criteria
for
inclusion
also
in
endangered
status
was
the
candidate
at
the
other
far
side
of
the
stage
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
who
continues
to
emphasize
her
middle-of-the-country
roots
and
middle-of-the-road
positions
her
focus
on
the
middle
surely
includes
the
early-caucus
state
of
iowa
her
neighbor
to
the
south
where
she
needs
a
breakout
showing
just
inside
from
the
two
ends
onstage
were
two
candidates
who
were
expected
to
make
more
noise
than
either
has
to
date
one
was
cory
booker
the
senator
from
new
jersey
a
tall
and
commanding
figure
who
got
the
night's
best
laugh
and
said
many
eloquent
things
on
gun
violence
and
the
status
of
his
fellow
black
americans
the
booker
campaign
professes
to
be
unworried
but
it
is
hard
to
fathom
why
booker
has
not
broken
through
in
the
early
states
or
the
national
polls
the
same
might
be
said
of
beto
o'rourke
the
former
congressman
from
el
paso
whose
campaign
has
drawn
new
impetus
from
last
month's
massacre
in
that
city
o'rourke
was
saluted
by
his
rivals
for
his
strong
stance
and
he
had
a
viral
moment
saying
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
referring
to
the
military-style
weapons
used
in
many
recent
mass
shootings
that
promise
however
does
not
reflect
the
position
of
most
of
the
other
candidates
or
of
the
democratic
caucus
in
the
house
or
the
senate
moving
in
toward
the
centerpiece
trio
one
found
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
ind
who
used
every
chance
he
got
to
insert
thoughtful
answers
with
a
fine-chiseled
edge
he
used
his
closing
remarks
to
say
how
much
it
had
meant
to
his
life
to
come
out
as
gay
and
marry
his
husband
the
fact
that
his
age
may
be
more
of
a
weight
for
his
candidacy
than
his
sexuality
is
one
measure
of
how
life
in
america
has
changed
in
mirroring
status
across
the
stage
stood
andrew
yang
a
young
entrepreneur
making
a
splash
with
younger
voters
and
casting
a
wider
net
with
ideas
for
guaranteed
federal
income
payments
in
lieu
of
other
programs
and
democracy
dollars
to
supplant
lobbyists
actual
dollars
which
leaves
us
with
kamala
harris
the
one
candidate
who
stood
aside
from
the
threesome
at
center
stage
but
was
not
part
of
the
trio
on
either
wing
the
california
senator
tried
a
good-natured
jab
at
biden
regarding
his
oft-repeated
ties
to
president
barack
obama
it
worked
in
its
way
especially
with
the
crowd
at
texas
southern
university
a
historically
black
school
but
it
didn't
have
nearly
the
bite
of
her
june
debate
challenge
to
biden
for
his
opposition
to
busing
for
school
integration
in
the
s
one
thing
harris
succeeded
in
doing
was
returning
the
debate
again
and
again
to
the
subject
of
donald
trump
one
after
another
the
candidates
would
acknowledge
that
beating
trump
was
everyone's
ultimate
goal
an
existential
necessity
for
the
party
and
the
overarching
unifying
element
in
this
contest

yet
curiously
not
one
candidate
mentioned
the
impeachment
debate
currently
raging
within
the
house
of
representatives
where
most
democrats
now
want
a
formal
impeachment
proceeding
but
speaker
nancy
pelosi
does
not
at
least
not
yet
neither
did
anyone
in
the
debate
mention
the
recession
jitters
that
polls
show
many
americans
feeling
if
only
because
the
length
of
the
current
expansion
and
indications
it
may
be
ending
that's
important
because
recessions
beat
incumbent
presidents
more
often
than
the
opposing
party's
nominee
does
no
incumbent
lost
between
the
depression
election
of
and
when
democrat
jimmy
carter
talked
of
an
economic
misery
index
in
ousting
republican
gerald
ford
that
same
index
was
even
worse
when
ronald
reagan
ousted
carter
four
years
later
george
h.w.
bush
also
lost
as
an
incumbent
in
the
victim
of
a
brief
recession
and
an
independent
candidate
ross
perot
who
got
of
the
popular
vote
since
then
three
incumbent
presidents
have
been
re-elected
and
none
has
lost
despite
the
efforts
of
well-known
well-financed
and
party-backed
challengers
robert
dole
john
kerry
and
mitt
romney
that
is
largely
why
polls
taken
this
week
by
cnn
and
by
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
found
a
plurality
of
americans
expect
trump
to
win
a
second
term
even
though
far
fewer
think
he
deserves
it
trump's
approval
number
is
now
among
the
lowest
ever
for
presidents
after
months
in
office
but
some
have
come
back
from
comparable
low
points
including
obama
and
reagan
who
came
back
to
win
states
it's
going
to
take
more
than
good
debate
performances
and
more
than
winning
the
nomination
for
one
of
these
democratic
contenders
to
defeat
this
incumbent
only
bad
economics
or
the
actions
of
the
incumbent
himself
are
likely
to
accomplish
that
but
to
make
themselves
attractive
as
a
reasonable
option
the
democrats
need
to
present
coherent
clear
alternatives
in
policy
and
persona
this
week's
debate
was
at
least
a
longer
step
in
that
direction
