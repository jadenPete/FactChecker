he
will
be
resigning
from
his
senate
seat
at
the
end
of
the
year
isakson
has
been
battling
parkinson's
disease
and
cited
health
problems
for
why
he's
stepping
aside
with
three
years
left
in
his
current
term
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
the
senator
said
it
has
been
the
honor
of
a
lifetime
to
serve
the
residents
of
georgia
after
much
prayer
and
consultation
with
my
family
and
doctors
i
have
made
the
very
tough
decision
to
leave
the
u.s.
senate
at
the
end
of
it
has
been
the
honor
of
a
lifetime
serving
the
state
of
georgia
this
decision
pains
me
greatly
but
i
know
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
isakson
was
reelected
to
a
third
term
in
georgia's
republican
gov
brian
kemp
will
appoint
a
interim
senator
to
serve
through
the
end
of
next
year
the
seat
will
then
be
subject
to
a
special
election
in
and
another
election
in
for
a
full
six-year
senate
term
senator
isakson's
list
of
accomplishments
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
he
loves
is
long
and
revered
kemp
said
in
a
statement
but
what
georgia
should
be
most
thankful
for
is
the
high
standard
that
johnny
held
as
a
true
gentleman
a
fighter
for
his
constituents
a
trusted
advocate
for
our
nation's
veterans
and
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
to
ever
answer
the
call
of
service
to
our
country
isakson's
retirement
means
a
second
georgia
seat
for
republicans
to
defend
next
year
sen
david
perdue
is
up
for
reelection
the
national
republican
senate
committee
chairman
todd
young
of
indiana
said
isakson
has
served
georgians
with
the
highest
integrity
and
distinction
in
the
u.s.
senate
he
will
be
missed
but
we
look
forward
to
the
men
and
women
of
georgia
electing
another
strong
republican
leader
in
alongside
david
perdue
young's
statement
said
in
recent
years
democrats
have
been
making
strides
in
typically
deep-red
georgia
democrat
stacey
abrams
lost
by
a
razor-thin
margin
to
kemp
in
georgia's
gubernatorial
election
in
isakson's
retirement
lead
to
near-instant
speculation
that
abrams
might
make
a
run
at
the
soon-to-be-open
senate
seat
but
she
quickly
knocked
down
those
pinning
hopes
on
her
candidacy
a
spokesman
said
on
abrams
official
twitter
account
our
thoughts
are
with
senator
isakson
and
his
family
while
she
will
not
be
a
candidate
herself
she
is
committed
to
helping
democratic
candidates
win
both
senate
races

against
every
fiber
of
my
being
to
