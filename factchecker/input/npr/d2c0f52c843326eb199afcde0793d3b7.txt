the

democratic

stage
is
set
with
just

ensuring
there
will
be
a
one-night
event
in
which
the
front-runners
will
finally
come
face

it's
the
third
debate
so
far
this
cycle
and
will
take
place
in
houston
hosted
by
abc
news
and
univision
stricter
qualification
rules
from
the
democratic
national
committee
required
candidates
to
hit
both
polling
and
fundraising
benchmarks
that
means
the
debate
field
from
june
and
july
has
been
slashed
in
half
the
biggest
demarcation
yet
in
the
race
to
determine
who
will
take
on
president
trump
for
democrats
frustrated
by
the
massive
field
of
candidates
the
smaller
focus
on
those
running
who
have
the
best
shot
to
actually
win
the
nomination
is
a
welcome
development
just
over
five
months
before
the
first
votes
are
cast
i'm
looking
forward
to
getting
to
the
place
assuming
i'm
still
around
that
it
gets
down
to
a
smaller
number
of
people
so
we
can
have
more
of
a
discussion
instead
of
one-minute
assertions
biden
told
reporters
after
a
campaign
event
in
spartanburg
s.c.
on
wednesday
notably
biden
will
finally
face
off
against
a
surging
warren
who
is
quickly
emerging
as
his
top
rival
thanks
to
a
random
drawing
to
determine
debate
order
for
the
first
two
meetings
the
two
have
yet
to
share
the
same
stage
i'm
just
gonna
be
me
and
she'll
be
her
let
people
make
their
judgments
i
have
great
respect
for
her
the
former
vice
president
said
of
a
matchup
with
the
massachusetts
senator
there
have
already
been
ramifications
from
the
dnc's
decision
to
curtail
the
debate
size
next
month
with
the
past
two
weeks
seeing
the
most
departures
yet
from
struggling
candidates
new
york
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
on
wednesday
became
the
latest
to
drop
out
citing
failure
to
make
the
stage
as
part
of
her
calculus

also
recently
ended
their
long
shot
bids
other
candidates
however
are
vowing
to
stay
and
fight
despite
the
decreased
exposure
and
mounting
odds
they
face
now
that
the
field
is
beginning
to
winnow
colorado
sen
michael
bennet's
campaign
sent
a
letter
to
dnc
chairman
tom
perez
demanding
clarification
on
how
the
debate
criteria
were
chosen
reaching
at
least
in
four
state
or
national
surveys
from
pollsters
recognized
from
the
dnc
along
with
hitting
unique
donors
from
at
least
states
to
date
the
dnc
has
not
provided
information
on
how
or
why
its
unprecedented
debate
qualification
requirements
were
set
nor
what
the
criteria
will
be
for
the
eight
future
debates
bennet
adviser
craig
hughes
wrote
the
least
we
owe
the
democratic
voters
is
transparency
about
why
and
how
decisions
are
being
made
on
their
behalf
to
ensure
a
fair
process

the
primary
continues

steve
bullock
bemoaned
that
there
won't
be
a
rural
voice
onstage
he's
touted
his
victory
in
a
state
trump
carried
by
points
if
you
look
at
really
being
the
only
one
that's
won
in
a
red
state
if
we
can't
win
michigan
wisconsin
pennsylvania
if
we
can't
make
a
difference
in
those
areas
even
those
that
voted
obama-obama-trump
it's
going
to
be
that
much
harder
to
win
this
election
bullock
argued
others
who
narrowly
missed
out
tried
to
see
a
silver
lining
the
same
rules
will
be
in
place
for
the
october
debate
meaning
that
while
the
same
candidates
are
guaranteed
a
spot
others
have
more
time
to
qualify
that
could
mean
an
expansion
back
to
two
debate
nights
instead
of
one
billionaire
activist
tom
steyer
is
the
latest
major
candidate
to
enter
the
race
reversing
an
earlier
decision
not
to
run
he
used
his
wealth
and
contacts
he
built
over
a
long
campaign
for
trump's
impeachment
to
hit
the
donor
requirements
he
hit
in
three
polls
but
missed
out
on
the
crucial
fourth
now
he
has
several
more
weeks
to
hit
that
mark
while
we
believe
that
voters
in
these
states
deserve
to
see
tom
on
the
debate
stage
in
houston
we
understand
the
rules
established
by
the
dnc
and
respect
the
process
steyer
campaign
manager
heather
hargreaves
said
in
a
statement
hawaii
rep
tulsi
gabbard
has
also
hit
the
fundraising
threshold
but
needs
two
more
polls
to
make
the
stage
in
october
author
and
spiritual
adviser
marianne
williamson
has
also
acquired
enough
donors
but
needs
three
more
surveys
where
she
registers
at
