president
trump
blamed
a
political
hack
job
for
reports
that
a
whistleblower
has
charged
he
had
an
improper
conversation
with
a
foreign
leader
the
washington
post
on
friday
reported
that
the
conversation
in
question
involves
ukraine
trump
dismissed
the
reporting
as
a
ridiculous
story
and
said
he
did
not
know
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
but
i
hear
it's
a
partisan
person
trump
said
it
was
a
totally
appropriate
conversation
it
was
actually
a
beautiful
conversation
although
he
did
not
specify
with
whom
asked
if
he
mentioned
former
vice
president
and
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
in
the
conversation
trump
said
somebody
ought
to
look
into
joe
biden's
statement
because
it's
disgraceful
trump
alleged
that
biden
talked
about
billions
of
dollars
that
he's
not
giving
to
a
certain
country
unless
a
certain
prosecutor
was
taken
off
the
case
trump
supporters
have
alleged
that
biden
while
in
office
urged
the
firing
of
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
who
was
allegedly
looking
into
son
hunter
biden's
business
dealings
the
younger
biden
joined
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
burisma
in
the
wall
street
journal
meanwhile
reported
friday
that
trump
during
a
july
phone
call
urged
ukraine
president
volodymyr
zelensky
about
eight
times
to
work
with
his
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
on
an
investigation
of
hunter
biden
joe
biden
told
reporters
on
the
campaign
trail
that
not
one
single
credible
outlet
has
given
any
credibility
to
his
assertions
not
one
single
one
and
so
i
have
no
comment
except
the
president
should
start
to
be
president
later
friday
evening
biden
released
a
fuller
statement
about
the
whistleblower
report
saying
if
they
are
true
then
there
is
truly
no
bottom
to
president
trump's
willingness
to
abuse
his
power
and
abase
our
country
this
behavior
is
particularly
abhorrent
because
it
exploits
the
foreign
policy
of
our
country
and
undermines
our
national
security
for
political
purposes
it
means
that
he
used
the
power
and
resources
of
the
united
states
to
pressure
a
sovereign
nation
a
partner
that
is
still
under
direct
assault
from
russia
pushing
ukraine
to
subvert
the
rule
of
law
in
the
express
hope
of
extracting
a
political
favor
such
clear-cut
corruption
damages
and
diminishes
our
institutions
of
government
by
making
them
tools
of
a
personal
political
vendetta
biden
called
for
trump
to
immediately
release
the
transcript
of
the
call
and
to
direct
the
office
of
the
director
national
intelligence
to
release
the
notification
to
congress
the
row
over
the
intelligence
community
whistleblower
mushroomed
after
the
ic's
top
watchdog
told
house
lawmakers
on
thursday
he
would
not
reveal
the
details
about
it
the
ukraine
connection
and
other
aspects
of
the
story
are
so
far
unverified
by
officialdom
trump
addressed
the
story
on
friday
when
he
took
questions
from
reporters
in
the
oval
office
prior
to
a
meeting
with
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
trump
said
of
the
whistleblower's
report
which
is
not
public
or
in
the
hands
of
congress
everybody's
read
it
they
laughed
at
it
it's
another
media
disaster
and
the
media
has
lost
so
much
credibility
in
this
country
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
said
on
friday
that
the
reports
of
what
she
labeled
a
reliable
whistleblower
complaint
raise
grave
urgent
concerns
for
our
national
security
we
must
be
sure
that
the
president
and
his
administration
are
conducting
our
national
security
and
foreign
policy
in
the
best
interest
of
the
american
people
not
the
president's
personal
interest
her
statement
added
that
the
administration's
blocking
of
acting
dni
joseph
maguire
from
providing
congress
with
the
complaint
violates
the
federal
statute
which
unequivocally
states
that
the
dni
shall
provide
congress
this
information
if
the
president
has
done
what
has
been
alleged
then
he
is
stepping
into
a
dangerous
minefield
with
serious
repercussions
for
his
administration
and
our
democracy
