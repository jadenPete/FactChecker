president

and
the
u.s.

are
trying
to

down
questions
about
conflicts
of
interest
that
erupted
over
stays
by
air
force
personnel
at
trump's
luxury
golf

in

the

says
the

is
reviewing
all
guidance
pertaining
to
selection
of
airports
and
lodging
accommodations
during
international
travels
the
reviews
follow
a
politico
report
about
a
seven-member
crew
of
a
c-
globemaster
iii
cargo
plane
staying
at
turnberry
earlier
this
year
the
crew
was
flying
the
c-
from
alaska
to
kuwait
and
stopped
for
refueling
at
glasgow
prestwick
airport
a
struggling
commercial
airport
that
is
key
to
turnberry's
business
model
the
airport
entered
into
an
official
partnership
with
the
trump
organization
in
before
taking
office
president
trump
turned
day-to-day
operations
of
his
companies
over
to
his
adult
sons
but
breaking
with
the
practice
of
past
presidents
he
did
not
divest
or
otherwise
distance
himself
from
his
businesses
trump
has
continued
to
promote
his
properties
and
brand
visiting
his
golf
resorts
repeatedly
and
he
even
publicly
suggested
that
next
year's
g-
summit
be
held
at
one
of
his
golf
resorts
in
florida
vice
president
pence
was
criticized
last
week
for
staying
at
a
trump
golf
resort
on
the
western
coast
of
ireland
instead
of
in
dublin
where
he
had
meetings
in
a
tweet
trump
claimed
to
know
nothing
about
an
air
force
plane
landing
at
an
airport
which
i
do
not
own
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
near
turnberry
resort
which
i
do
own
he
added
that
the
service
members
staying
at
his
resort
have
good
taste
it
wasn't
just
one
plane
since
president
trump
took
office
military
aircraft
stops
at
prestwick
airport
have
increased
dramatically
according
to
air
force
statistics
air
mobility
command
aircraft
stopped
at
prestwick
times
in
so
far
this
year
there
have
been
stops
of
them
involving
overnight
stays
the
air
force
didn't
indicate
how
many
of
the
overnight
stays
were
at
the
trump
turnberry
resort
but
that
figure
does
include
the
stay
earlier
this
year
by
the
c-
crew
highlighted
by
politico
thomas
the
air
force's
top
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
that
while
initial
reviews
indicate
that
aircrew
transiting
through
scotland
adhered
to
all
guidance
and
procedures
we
understand
that
u.s.
service
members
lodging
at
higher-end
accommodations
even
if
within
government
rates
might
be
allowable
but
not
advisable
the
house
oversight
committee
which
in
june
requested
documents
from
the
secretary
of
defense
said
in
a
letter
that
given
the
president's
continued
financial
stake
in
his
scotland
golf
courses
there
are
questions
about
the
president's
potential
receipt
of
u.s.
or
foreign
government
emoluments
in
violation
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
other
serious
conflict
of
interest
concerns
a
democratic
national
committee
aide
told
npr
that
the
committee
has
been
investigating
the
incident
outlined
in
the
politico
report
and
other
similar
reports
the
aide
added
that
so
far
the
defense
department
has
not
produced
a
single
document
in
this
investigation
the
committee
will
be
forced
to
consider
alternative
steps
if
the
pentagon
does
not
begin
complying
voluntarily
in
the
coming
days
when
the
partnership
between
prestwick
airport
and
the
trump
organization
was
announced
a
press
release
explained
that
people
visiting
turnberry
which
is
miles
from
the
airport
would
be
provided
transfers
via
the
luxurious
trump
helicopter
executive
cars
or
private
hire
the
synergy
of
trump
turnberry
and
prestwick
airport
working
together
is
crucial
for
both
parties
as
we
further
develop
golf
and
tourism
in
ayrshire
and
scotland
ralph
porciani
the
general
manager
of

turnberry
was

thomas
explained
that
c-
aircraft
have
increasingly
used
prestwick
as
a
stopover
because
it
has
hour
operations
making
it
a
more
viable
option
for
aircraft
headed
to
and
from
the
middle
east
and
afghanistan
many
military
stopover
locations
he
explained
have
imposed
increasingly
restrictive
operating
hours
in
he
said
air
mobility
command
issued
a
directive
to
flight
crews
to
increase
efficiency
prestwick
was
listed
as
a
top-five
stopover
location
due
to
favorable
weather
and
less
traffic
from
other
aircraft
according
to
the
house
oversight
committee
letter
since
october
the
defense
logistics
agency
has
purchased
million
in
jet
fuel
from
prestwick
airport
this
airport
has
a
large
parking
area
is
open
and
has
been
contracted
by
dod
for
fuel
at
standardized
prices
thomas
explained
ethics
watchers
cry
foul
even
with
all
these
explanations
ethics
watchers
who
have
been
repeatedly
critical
of
president
trump
say
this
episode
is
another
reminder
of
the
hazards
of
a
president
who
continues
to
own
a
private
business
and
profit
from
government
business
to
believe
usaf's
claim
that
stays
at
turnberry
were
normal
you'd
have
to
believe
it's
a
coincidence
trump
owns
it
emoluments
are
ok
no
hotels
under
were
within
miles
of
the
airport
the
cost
of
meals
incidentals
is
irrelevant
and
an
appearance
of
corruption
is
fine
