joe
biden
wants
voters
to
look
at
the
big
picture
his
campaign
is
focused
on
a
mission
to
restore
the
soul
of
this
nation
that's
also
why
the
former
vice
president
does
not
think
anyone
should
get
bogged
down
in
the
small
details
he
mixes
up
on
the
campaign
trail
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
judgment
of
whether
or
not
you
send
troops
to
war
the
judgment
of
whether
you
bring
someone
home
the
judgment
of
whether
you
decide
on
a
health
care
policy
biden
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
and
iowa
public
radio
in
a
wide-ranging
interview
biden
is
prone
to
flubs
and
gaffes
and
has
been
for
years
most
recently
the
washington
post
reported
that
a
dramatic
story
he
told
about
the
war
in
afghanistan
conflated
and
confused
facts
from
multiple
different
incidents
biden
has
said
that
he
was
not
intentionally
trying
to
mislead
anyone
with
that
story
and
he
argues
that
kind
of
mistake
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
ability
to
serve
as
president
the
details
are
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
biden
told
npr
what
a
biden
presidency
would
look
like
on
the
campaign
trail
biden
often
touts
his
relationship
with
former
president
barack
obama
telling
voters
particularly
african
americans
about
his
buddy
barack
biden's
agenda
also
builds
on
the
obama
administration
he
is
arguing
for
an
expansion
of
the
affordable
care
act
rather
than
a
medicare
for
all
system
advocated
by
some
of
his
rivals

if

wanted
a
third

of

would
they
not
have
chosen
hillary

in
biden
disagreed
with
that
assessment
i
campaigned
like
the
devil
for
hillary
but
hillary
had
different
positions
than
the
president
had
and
she
emphasized
different
aspects
of
what
would
have
occurred
had
i
been
the
nominee
said
biden
that
doesn't
mean
i
would've
won
i
don't
mean
that
and
he
says
this
is
a
very
different
campaign
because
of
donald
trump
we
weren't
facing
anything
that
we're
facing
today
with
this

three
years

said
biden
the
next
president
is
going
to
have
to
be
able
to
pull
the
world
back
together
not
a
joke
literally
not
figuratively
pull
the

four
more
years
of

president
there
will

no
nato
resetting
u.s.
trade
policy
and
addressing
climate
change
are
key
priorities
for
biden
and
an
opportunity
for
distinction
from
obama
the
idea
that
we
would
have
another
trade
agreement
without
environmentalists
and
labor
sitting

us
will
not
happen

he
said
biden
has
said
if
elected
he
would
renegotiate
the
trans-pacific
partnership
rather
than
fully
supporting
the
initial
plan
as
proposed
as
vice
president
he
had
been
a
vocal
supporter
of

foreign
policy
decisions
the
year-old
former
vice
president
and
longtime
delaware
senator
defended
his
broader
record
on
foreign
policy
pointing
out
that
he
has
more
experience
than
all
of
his
opponents
combined
with
that
long
record
biden
has
faced
criticism
over
the
years
for
his
judgment
on
key
foreign
policy
decisions
such
as
voting
to
authorize
the
iraq
war
trying
to
partition
the
country
along
ethnic
and
sectarian
lines
opposing
a
troop
surge
and
overseeing
the
withdrawal
in
that
some
say
created
a
power
vacuum
that
allowed
isis
to
flourish
in
iraq
he's
been
wrong
on
nearly
every
major
foreign
policy
and
national
security
issue
over
the
past
four
decades
former
defense
secretary
robert
gates
wrote

biden
told
npr
he
explained
that
his
rationale
in
authorizing
the
use
of
military
force
in
iraq
in
was
based
on
a
commitment
he
had
received
from
then-president
george

bush
that
he
would
not
go
to
war

looked

in

not

before
you

we
had
shock

awe
bush's
office
denied
biden's
version
of
events
i'm
sure
it's
just
an
innocent
mistake
of
memory
but
this
recollection
is
flat
wrong
said
spokesman
freddy
ford
in
an
email
to
npr
the
biden
campaign
pointed
to
numerous
remarks
from
bush
at
the
time
where
he
said
he
hoped
to
go
through
the
u.n.
security
council
to
avoid
a
military
conflict
with
iraq
immediately
that
moment
it
started
i
came
out
against
the
war
at
that
moment
biden
told
npr
but
in
multiple
public
remarks
made
after
the
invasion
began
in
biden
openly
supported
the
effort
biden
publicly
said
his
vote
was
a
mistake
as
early
as
but
not
immediately
when
the
war
began
in
nine
months
ago
i
voted
with
my
colleagues
to
give
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
authority
to
use
force
and
i
would
vote
that
way
again
today
biden
said
in
a
speech
at
the
brookings
institution
on
july
it
was
a
right
vote
then
and
it'll
be
a
correct
vote
today
a
former
senior
policy
adviser
to
biden
clarified
that
he
was
highly
critical
of
the
bush
administration's
strategy
and
intelligence
failures
from
the
outset
but
once
the
u.s.
military
was
deployed
biden
supported
resources
for
the
troops
biden
is
also
clear
now
that
he
thinks
his
vote
was
a
mistake
