but
it's
not
clear
what
the
senate

president

will
accept
a
house
committee
will
take
up
legislation
on
tuesday
aimed
at
preventing
mass
shootings
as
lawmakers
and
the
white
house
move
to
respond
to
a
recent
spate
of
attacks
across
the
country
the
bills
being
considered
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
include
measures
that
would
limit
access
to
high-capacity
gun
magazines
and
block
any
person
convicted
of
a
hate
crime
from
obtaining
a
firearm
another
measure
under
consideration
would
provide
incentives
for
states
to
adopt
policies
for
extreme
risk
protection
orders
also
known
as
red
flag
laws
to
allow
the
government
to
temporarily
bar
someone
in
crisis
from
obtaining
guns
while
the
house
is
moving
forward
on
these
bills
it's
unclear
what
legislation
may
come
up
for
a
vote
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
made
clear
that
he
will
not
hold
any
votes
on
the
issue
until
president
trump
outlines
what
he
will
support
so
far
trump
has
called
for
action
but
has
not
publicly
identified
what
policies
he
would
back
the
absence
of
detail
has
created
frustration
for
some
of
his
allies
in
the
senate
the
president
needs
to
step
up
here
and
set
some
guidelines
for
what
he
would
do
said
sen
roy
blunt
r-mo
on
nbc's
meet
the
press
on
sunday
the
white
house
has
been
meeting
with
members
of
congress
and
those
affected
by
mass
shootings
to
gather
feedback
on
next
steps
we
hope
the
president
can
take
the
lead
said
tony
montalto
president

was
killed
in
the
shooting
at
marjory

fla
he
and
other
family
members
affected
by
the
shooting
visited
the
white
house
at
the
end
of
august
to
discuss
next
steps
this
is
clearly
a
time
for
statesmanship
not
partisanship
we
need
all
our
congressional
leaders
to
work
together
for
the
good
of
americans
and
help
make
us
safer
montalto
said
he
said
background
checks
and
federal
support
for
red
flag
laws
were
both
discussed
during
their
meeting
after
back-to-back
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
killed
people
trump
called
for
strong
action
on
expanding
background
checks
but
in
recent
weeks
trump
has
talked
more
about
the
need
to
address
mental
health
issues
and
raised
concerns
about
the
effectiveness
of
universal
background
checks
we
have
to
protect
our
second
amendment
very
strongly
trump
told
reporters
on
monday
when
asked
about
gun
control
the
white
house
says
that
various
measures
are
being
weighed
at
this
point
it's
a
deliberative
process
said
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
we
want
do
something
that
will
actually
help
not
just
something
that
will
make
people
feel
good
max
schachter
attended
the
august
white
house
meeting
his
son
alex
was
killed
in
the
parkland
shooting
he
said
he
was
told
that
the
white
house
wants
to
do
something
substantial
i'm
hoping
that
really
happens
said
schachter
schachter
said
he
supports
closing
loopholes
in
background
checks
for
gun
buyers
and
also
expediting
the
death
penalty
for
mass
murderers
democrats
in
congress
are
saying
that
they
do
not
plan
to
give
up
on
pushing
for
gun
control
measures
we
are
not
taking
no
for
an
answer
we
are
not
going
away
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
vowed
at
a
news
conference
on
monday
she
touted
recent
public
opinion
polls
that
indicated
overwhelming
support
for
proposals
like
the
house-passed
bill
requiring
background
checks
for
almost
all
gun
sales
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
said
he's
spoken
to
the
president
several
times
in
the
past
month
and
he's
all
over
the
lot
on
the
gun
issue
he
argued
that
the
public
support
for
new
gun
control
measures
means
it's
a
different
era
from
previous
times
when
congress
failed
to
advance
any
legislation
