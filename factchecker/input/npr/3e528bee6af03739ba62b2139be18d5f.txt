president
trump
has
fired
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
the
lifelong
proponent
of
american
hard
power
after
months
of
division
between
the
men
over
the
direction
of
foreign
and
national
security
policy
trump
announced
the
news
tuesday
on
twitter
bolton
responded
with
his
own
post
on
twitter
asserting
that
he
had
initiated
the
idea
that
he
would
step
down
but
that
trump
decided
to
wait
until
the
following
day
bolton
was
trump's
third
national
security
adviser
and
continued
the
pattern
of
departures
by
advisers
who
proved
a
bad
fit
for
a
white
house
led
by
the
rare
president
with
no
prior
experience
with
the
military
national
security
or
elected
office
deputy
white
house
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
told
reporters
that
bolton's
deputy
charles
kupperman
now
will
serve
as
an
acting
national
security
adviser
as
a
protege
of
bolton
kupperman
is
unlikely
to
last
very
long
in
the
job
trump
said
he
would
name
a
new
adviser
next
week
the
position
does
not
require
senate
confirmation
so
trump
can
pick
whoever
he
likes
but
it
was
unclear
on
tuesday
who
the
white
house
considers
to
be
among
the
potential
candidates
as
for
bolton
his
priorities
and
policies
just
don't
line
up
with
the
president
gridley
said
there
is
no
one
issue
here
they
just
didn't
align
on
many
issues
the
summit
that
never
was
the
dismissal
followed
a
head-spinning
turn
of
events
that
began
over
the
weekend
with
an
announcement
on
twitter
by
trump
that
he
had
invited
delegations
from
afghanistan
including
the
taliban
to
camp
david
for
peace
talks
but
then
canceled
the
meeting
before
it
could
take
place
trump
then
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
on
monday
that
he
considered
the
peace
negotiations
to
be
dead
the
president
appeared
to
have
taken
on
the
afghanistan
portfolio
himself
and
cut
some
of
his
advisers
including
bolton
out
of
the
matter
tensions
reached
a
point
at
which
bolton
reportedly
was
excluded
from
meetings
about
the
war
in
afghanistan
an
issue
that
might
otherwise
have
obviously
fallen
into
the
purview
of
the
national
security
adviser
but
trump
had
become
a
dove
and
wanted
to
reach
a
peace
agreement
that
would
permit
the
withdrawal
of
most
or
all
american
forces
from
afghanistan
the
president's
allies
felt
they
couldn't
trust
bolton
not
to
blow
up
the
process
in
the
way
bolton
also
may
have
complicated
earlier
talks
by
pushing
for
a
tougher
stance
with
north
korea
at
one
point
special
envoy
zalmay
khalilzad
would
not
agree
to
let
bolton
take
a
draft
copy
of
the
afghanistan
agreement
out
of
the
conference
room
where
they
were
meeting
the
washington
post
reported
i
knew
there
were
some
concerns
about
the
whole
taliban
meeting
but
i
didn't
know
for
sure
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
told
reporters
on
tuesday
graham
a
sometime
ally
of
the
president
but
who
has
been
skeptical
of
the
afghanistan
talks
said
he
thought
trump
should
have
the
adviser
he
wants
in
the
job
these
kinds
of
differences
between
trump
and
bolton
eventually
spun
the
two
men
too
far
apart
the
president
been
signaling
his
displeasure
with
him
for
a
while
said
fernando
cutz
who
served
as
senior
director
at
the
national
security
council
in
the
trump
administration
until
last
year
we
saw
a
lot
of
the
telltale
signs
that
the
president
uses
when
he
doesn't
like
somebody
being
used
on
bolton
for
a
while
now
isolating
him
from
meetings
sending
him
to
mongolia
when
he
went
to
north
korea
and
sending
him
to
warsaw
when
he
wanted
to
make
a
key
decision
on
the
taliban
hawk
bolton's
aggressive
positions
on
venezuela
north
korea
and
afghanistan
clashed
with
the
comparative
reluctance
of
his
boss
to
entertain
new
confrontations
and
his
enthusiasm
about
winding
down
some
old
ones
trump
promised
to
cut
bait
on
the
long-running
war
in
afghanistan
faulted
the
u.s.
invasion
of
iraq
and
rattled
the
foundations
of
america's
security
posture
around
the
world
including
its
forward
deployment
of
forces
and
system
of
alliances
in
europe
and
asia
bolton
meanwhile
communicated
in
old-school
terms
to
leaders
in
caracas
pyongyang
and
tehran
with
threats
about
the
prospect
of
direct
action
by
the
u.s.
military
in
one
episode
he
displayed
a
legal
pad
that
mused
about
sending
the
equivalent
of
an
army
brigade
to
venezuela's
neighbor
colombia
during
a
chill
in
relations
with
iran
bolton
couched
the
long-planned
deployment
of
an
aircraft
carrier
the
uss
abraham
lincoln
as
a
quick
response
to
ostensible
threats
by
iranian
forces
to
american
troops
in
the
middle
east
u.s.
commanders
also
sent
other
units
including
b-
bombers
in
what
they
called
a
move
to
try
to
deter
an
iranian
attack
and
bolton
also
was
said
to
have
been
a
crucial
force
in
torpedoing
an
agreement
between
trump
and
north
korean
dictator
kim
jong
un
seeking
broad
concessions
from
kim
about
his
weapons
of
mass
destruction
angry
north
korean
officials
later
called
bolton
dim-sighted
the
sum
of
positions
like
these
and
others
was
a
national
security
adviser
with
a
view
about
american
strategic
ways
means
and
goals
that
wound
up
at
stark
odds
with
that
of
the
president
in
all
three
north
korea
iran
and
venezuela
bolton
wanted
a
war
and
the
president
didn't
cutz
said
prolonged
estrangement
trump
administration
officials
have
been
quoted
for
some
time
in
press
reports
describing
the
unease
with
which
the
president
began
to
see
bolton's
moves
trump
appeared
to
have
been
focused
elsewhere
including
on
trade
negotiations
with
china
and
then
become
dismayed
when
he
checked
back
in
with
the
issues
in
bolton's
portfolio
trump
who
has
mocked
what
he
has
called
the
wasted
sacrifice
and
money
involved
with
america's
wars
in
the
middle
east
especially
since
the
united
states
hadn't
taken
any
oil
for
itself
or
some
other
economic
recompense
was
not
pleased
to
see
news
coverage
about
bolton
bringing
the
united
states
to
the
brink
of
a
crisis
with
iran
trump
eventually
admitted
that
for
as
much
as
he
said
he
liked
bolton
he
was
aware
of
his
own
need
to
rein
him
in
he
has
strong
views
on
things
but
that's
ok
i
actually
temper
john
which
is
pretty
amazing
trump
said
on
may
i'm
the
one
that
tempers
him
that's
ok
i
have
different
sides
i
have
john
bolton
and
other
people
that
are
a
little
more
dovish
than
him
i
like
john
the
mustache
and
the
line
bolton
followed
army
lt
gen
h.r.
mcmaster
a
widely
respected
but
straight-laced
strategist
who
never
clicked
with
trump
personally
and
retired
lt
gen
mike
flynn
who
was
forced
out
of
the
administration
early
as
part
of
the
russia
imbroglio
bolton
already
was
a
well-known
conservative
apostle
of
intervention
and
regime
change
who
had
earlier
served
as
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
in
the
administration
of
president
george
w.
bush
he
went
on
to
became
a
senior
fellow
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
and
served
as
a
commentator
in
the
press
and
on
fox
news
when
mcmaster's
departure
created
the
opening
for
him
in
early
trump
liked
bolton's
tv
appearances
and
sought
his
counsel
unofficially
before
bringing
him
formally
into
the
administration
bolton
reportedly
was
instrumental
in
shaping
trump's
tough
iran
policy
even
before
he
reentered
the
government
he
might
have
been
recruited
even
sooner
but
the
president's
hand
was
reportedly
stayed
for
some
time
in
part
because
of
bolton's
mustache
once
trump
overcame
his
objections
the
new
national
security
adviser
seized
his
new
position
at
the
top
of
the
official
national
security
decision-making
apparatus
shaping
the
staff
with
his
own
appointees
and
leaning
into
shaping
policy
gaps
opened
almost
immediately
between
bolton
and
trump
based
on
the
president's
freewheeling
style
that
included
making
policy
via
twitter
or
in
impromptu
remarks
by
the
summer
trump
was
saying
that
we'll
have
to
see
whether
washington
would
recognize
the
borders
of
ukraine
since
russia's
invasion
in
crimea
and
the
eastern
border
bolton
was
then
asked
whether
the
administration
actually
would
concede
the
claims
made
by
russia
based
on
its
use
of
force
the
national
security
adviser
no
fan
of
moscow
sought
to
draw
a
distinction
between
trump's
musings
and
what
might
be
produced
by
the
national
security
council
or
the
defense
department
that's
not
the
position
of
the
united
