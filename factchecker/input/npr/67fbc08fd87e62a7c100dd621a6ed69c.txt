supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
is
facing
a
new
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
leading
some
democrats
to
call
for
his
impeachment
above
he
listens
to
a
discussion
at
a
washington
event
there
are
renewed
calls
for
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
to
be
impeached
after
an
essay
in
the
new
york
times
excerpting
a
book
by
times
reporters
was
published
this
weekend
the
essay
includes
a
previously
unreported
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
against
kavanaugh
involving
a
female
student
while
he
was
at
yale
university
npr
has
not
confirmed
the
allegation
the
reporters
include
the
name
of
someone
who
said
he
witnessed
it
but
that
person
has
declined
to
speak
publicly
about
it
and
has
not
responded
to
npr's
attempts
to
reach
him
according
to
the
times
the
female
student
also
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
her
friends
say
she
doesn't
recall
the
incident
kavanaugh
is
also
not
speaking
the
justice
declines
to
comment
a
supreme
court
spokeswoman
told
npr
he
has
denied
past
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
some
democrats
running
for
president
including
kamala
harris
juli
n
castro
and
elizabeth
warren
are
now
calling
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
there
has
not
been
an
investigation
with
the
level
of
attention
that
normally
would
occur
around
these
kinds
of
allegations
and
especially
related
to
the
subject
at
hand
which
is
the
appropriateness
of
this
individual
serving
on
the
highest
court
of
our
land
for
a
lifetime
appointment
harris
said
monday
on
npr's
morning
edition
calls
for
impeachment
though
put
democrats
in
a
political
pickle
their
base
believes
kavanaugh
lied
about
these
incidents
in
his
testimony
before
congress
and
they
are
dissatisfied
with
what
they
believe
was
a
cursory
investigation
by
the
fbi
sen
chris
coons
for
example
sent
the
very
allegation
reported
on
in
the
times
essay
to
the
fbi
on
oct
of
last
year
nonetheless
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
four
days
later
but
the
democratic
leadership
believes
impeachment
of
kavanaugh
or
president
trump
for
that
matter
can't
be
done
without
hard
evidence
that
can
sway
public
opinion
and
some
republicans
to
its
side
otherwise
democratic
leaders
see
it
as
a
futile
effort
expending
too
much
political
capital
distracting
from
their
policy
agenda
and
jeopardizing
their
chances
to
retain
the
house
and
beat
trump
in
so
how
would
impeachment
work
and
more
importantly
how
likely
is
it
that
he
would
be
impeached
hint
not
very
can
a
supreme
court
justice
be
impeached
yes
the
u.s.
constitution
lays
it
out
in
article
ii
section
judges
fall
under
all
civil
officers
of
the
united
states
what
does
the
constitution
say
about
judges
behavior
there's
a
reference
to
judges
behavior
in
article
iii
section
i
emphasis
ours
but
that
does
not
mean
that
bad
behavior
is
necessarily
grounds
for
impeachment
here
is
how
the
legal
information
institute
at
cornell
law
school
explains
it
how
would
the
process
work
it
would
be
the
same
as
removing
a
president
which
democrats
currently
are
also
struggling
with
how
to
address
given
that
the
majority
of
house
democrats
now
favor
beginning
the
impeachment
process
against
president
trump
the
house
would
need
to
bring
it
up
and
charges
would
need
to
be
filed
having
to
do
with
treason
bribery
or
other
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
the
house
would
need
just
a
majority
for
impeachment
but
to
remove
the
official
two-thirds
of
the
u.s.
senate
would
need
to
vote
to
do
so
the
house
is
controlled
by
democrats
and
the
senate
is
controlled
by
republicans
has
a
supreme
court
justice
ever
been
impeached
yes
but
only
one
it
was
more
than
years
ago
and
he
wasn't
removed
from
office
the
justice
was
samuel
chase
he
criticized
president
thomas
jefferson's
policies
before
a
grand
jury
in
baltimore
and
with
jefferson's
party
controlling
congress
jefferson
gave
the
green
light
to
impeach
chase
the
house
impeached
him
in
but
the
senate
in
did
not
affirm
it
and
remove
him
that
established
a
high
bar
for
impeaching
or
removing
a
justice
and
established
that
their
decisions
should
not
matter
in
impeaching
or
removing
them
from
office
then-chief
justice
william
rehnquist
wrote
a
book
on
judicial
impeachment
and
as
cited
by
douglas
keith
at
the
brennan
center
for
justice
noted
about
chase's
impeachment
that
it
was
enormously
important
in
securing
the
kind
of
judicial
independence
contemplated
by
the
constitution
have
any
judges
been
removed
from
office
yes
eight
have
been
removed
from
office
after
convictions
in
the
senate
fifteen
have
been
impeached
mostly
for
making
false
statements
favoritism
toward
litigants
or
special
appointees
intoxication
on
the
bench
and
abuse
of
the
contempt
power
the
brennan
center
notes
the
last
to
be
removed
from
office
was
g.
thomas
porteous
a
federal
judge
in
new
orleans
in
he
was
convicted
on
four
articles
of
impeachment
the
ap
wrote
at
the
time
a
year
earlier
a
federal
judge
out
of
texas
samuel
kent
was
impeached
by
the
house
after
admitting
to
sexually
harassing
and
abusing
two
female
members
of
his
staff
as
npr
reported
at
the
time
he
was
also
convicted
of
obstruction
of
justice
kent
however
resigned
before
the
senate
could
vote
to
remove
him
from
office
will
house
democrats
push
forward
to
impeach
kavanaugh
it's
highly
unlikely
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
of
new
york
told
wnyc
on
monday
that
he
has
questions
for
fbi
director
christopher
wray
on
how
the
fbi
handled
the
investigation
into
the
kavanaugh
allegations
but
he
is
focused
on
trump
also
kavanaugh's
removal
is
a
near
impossibility
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
sen
lindsey
graham
chair
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
tweeted
monday
i
promise
you
justice
kavanaugh
will
not
be
impeached
over
these
scurrilous
accusations
so
going
out
on
that
limb
has
to
weigh
on
democrats
as
well
trump
and
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
both
have
leaped
to
kavanaugh's
defense
trump
tweeted
about
kavanaugh
several
times
on
monday
defending
the
justice
he
appointed
and
saying
that
democrats
are
looking
to
destroy
and
influence
his
opinions
and
that
they
should
be
sued
mcconnell
called
the
allegations
against
kavanaugh
uncorroborated
and
unsubstantiated
not
even
all
senate
democrats
are
totally
on
board
sen
doug
jones
of
alabama
noted
on
msnbc
that
kavanaugh
could
be
impeached
if
he
in
fact
lied
to
congress
but
he
added
at
some
point
though
i
mean
he
was
confirmed
that
is
what
our
constitution
says
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
who
is
also
running
for
president
said
on
abc's
this
week
that
it
was
premature
to
say
kavanaugh
should
be
impeached
but
she
criticized
the
confirmation
process
that
played
out
as
a
sham
and
is
calling
for
more
documents
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
impeachment
hearings
without
getting
the
documents
she
said
if
the
impeachment
process
is
unlikely
to
result
in
kavanaugh's
removal
why
do
some
democrats
want
to
go
through
with
it
anyway
harris
acknowledged
on
npr
that
kavanaugh
is
unlikely
to
be
removed
from
office
but
she
still
believes
congress
should
act
i
don't
think
in
the
united
states
senate
that
the
leader
of
the
senate
would
allow
that
there
would
be
a
vote
if
the
house
returned
articles
of
impeachment
to
actually
convict
she
said
tying
in
trump
as
well
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
process
shouldn't
take
hold
and
this
relates
to
the
topic
of
impeachment
as
it
relates
to
another
individual
she
added
if
you
gauge
what
the
united
states
senate
has
done
to
the
current
leadership
it
has
been
coddling
and
frankly
not
holding
it
to
account
this
administration
on
a
number
of
levels
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
those
of
us
who
have
a
responsibility
to
act
shouldn't
act
