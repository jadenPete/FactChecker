president
trump
walks
off
stage
after
a
campaign
rally
at
the
snhu
arena
in
manchester
n.h.
last
month
many
heads
got
scratched
this
week
when
president
trump
doubled
down
on
his
erroneous
claim
that
alabama
had
been
in
the
path
of
hurricane
dorian
apparently
relying
on
a
map
that
warned
of
high
winds
or
another
showing
hypothetical
paths
for
the
storm
the
president
over
the
weekend
insisted
alabama
was
in
the
crosshairs
at
midweek
sitting
in
the
oval
office
he
held
up
a
map
on
which
someone
using
a
marking
pen
had
ballooned
the
area
of
actual
hurricane
threat
to
include
alabama
the
question
had
to
be
asked
wouldn't
it
be
enough
to
be
worried
about
florida
georgia
and
the
rest
of
the
southeastern
coast
without
dragging
in
alabama
a
state
outside
the
current
danger
zone
perhaps
but
in
seeking
to
understand
the
moment
it
was
tempting
to
observe
that
alabama
is
arguably
the
cornerstone
of
the
president's
base
of
support
in
seeking
a
second
term
while
states
have
consistently
shown
the
president
at
job
approval
or
better
according
to
gallup
alabama
is
one
of
just
three
states
where
trump's
approval
has
often
topped
since
inauguration
day
according
to
the
morning
consult
tracking
poll
trump's
approval
is
points
positive
in
west
virginia
and
in
wyoming
in
alabama
it
is
and
alabama
has
more
votes
in
the
electoral
college
than
those
two
other
states
combined
do
such
things
matter
to
a
president
seeking
reelection
they
just
might
especially
when
that
president
is
struggling
to
raise
his
public
approval
nationwide
the
president
is
setting
his
course
on
issues
from
guns
and
trade
to
immigration
and
abortion
and
his
stances
on
those
make
it
clear
he
is
playing
to
his
base
all
politicians
want
as
many
voters
as
they
can
get
and
all
begin
their
calculations
by
relying
on
a
core
of
support
but
in
american
presidential
politics
the
ultimate
question
is
not
just
how
many
voters
one
has
but
where
they
live
because
in
american
presidential
politics
the
electoral
college
rules
while
much
time
and
attention
is
devoted
to
tracking
the
president's
approval
rating
nationwide
and
his
supporters
can
be
found
in
any
part
of
the
country
all
that
matters
in
the
end
is
the
president's
standing
state
by
state
examining
trends
in
individual
states
offers
a
clearer
picture
of
trump's
reelection
prospects
a
little
more
than
a
year
from
now
and
a
rationale
for
his
strategy
it
also
highlights
the
degree
to
which
the
country's
issue
conflicts
and
partisan
rivalries
are
defined
by
differences
in
population
density
where
the
urban-
and
inner-suburban
metro
areas
are
politically
dominant
democrats
prevail
otherwise
the
president
and
the
republican
party
hold
sway
and
where
the
city-country
balance
is
closer
to
even
we
have
a
swing
state
that
sets
the
landscape
for
with
president
trump
hoping
to
again
win
the
states
he
won
in
with
votes
in
the
electoral
college
that
gives
him
a
margin
of
electoral
college
votes
because
it
takes
to
win
for
a
majority
electors
who
make
up
the
electoral
college
so
how's
he
faring
in
the
effort
to
do
it
again
when
being
popular
isn't
the
answer
it's
nice
to
win
the
popular
vote
and
the
popular
vote
usually
underscores
the
final
decision
not
always
though
see
and
in
reality
the
national
popular
vote
has
no
role
in
the
choice
of
the
president
that
choice
is
determined
by
the
electoral
college
guided
by
the
popular
vote
in
each
state
note
if
no
one
gets
a
majority
in
the
electoral
college
the
choice
is
made
in
the
house
of
representatives
where
for
just
this
one
decision
each
state
gets
one
vote
with
this
in
mind
defining
trump's
base
requires
both
defining
his
voters
and
counting
the
states
where
they
will
cast
at
least
a
plurality
of
the
vote
in
trump
won
those
states
with
electoral
votes
though
there
were
two
faithless
electors
in
texas
who
voted
for
ohio
gov
john
kasich
and
kentucky
sen
rand
paul
leaving
trump
technically
with
looking
ahead
to
though
trump
looks
to
only
be
able
to
count
on
a
little
more
than
half
of
those
states
to
continue
backing
him
come
what
may
trump's
approval
rating
averaged
just
nationwide
in
according
to
gallup
and
his
approval
rating
was
above
in
states
all
of
which
he
had
carried
in
the
trump
are
tennessee
missouri
south
carolina
alabama
kentucky
oklahoma
utah
arkansas
mississippi
kansas
west
virginia
idaho
montana
south
dakota
north
dakota
alaska
and
wyoming
these
numbers
are
based
on
the
gallup
tracking
poll
that
takes
soundings
times
a
year
it
is
generally
corroborated
by
the
readings
done
by
morning
consult
although
morning
consult
had
sub-
readings
for
trump
in
utah
at
several
points
in
the
first
two
years
it
was
above
this
summer
as
are
texas
and
missouri
in
the
first
weeks
of
during
the
government
shutdown
both
gallup
and
morning
consult
found
trump
dipping
below
by
a
point
or
two
in
some
of
the
larger
states
in
this
core
but
in
each
the
rating
quickly
snapped
back
above
when
the
shutdown
ended
and
has
remained
there
since
these
states
then
would
have
to
be
regarded
as
the
purest
definition
of
trump's
geographic
base
the
firmest
foundation
for
his
reelection
beyond
that
they
easily
provide
most
of
the
senators
who
make
republican
mitch
mcconnell
the
senate
majority
leader
the
current
senate
has
republican
members
of
whom
hail
from
those
same
states
as
a
measure
of
how
american
politics
has
changed
consider
that
there
were
democrats
from
these
states
when
bill
clinton
became
president
one
democrat
from
that
era
richard
shelby
of
alabama
is
still
around
but
he
switched
to
the
gop
in
right
after
that
party
became
the
senate
majority
he
symbolizes
how
populists
from
largely
rural
states
in
the
south
and
west
have
migrated
from
one
party
to
the
other
and
become
the
hard
base
for
trump
it
has
long
been
noted
that
trump
a
former
manhattan
socialite
and
billionaire
makes
an
odd
champion
for
these
voters
and
these
regions
of
the
country
but
his
willingness
to
take
up
their
causes
has
largely
won
them
over
and
in
his
emergence
from
a
field
of
candidates
to
win
the
republican
party
nomination
installed
him
atop
a
party
that
now
commands
the
loyalty
of
rural
america
as
never
before
the
more
rural
the
more
pro-trump
within
the
states
and
across
the
national
map
party
loyalties
can
be
perceived
as
a
function
of
population
density
all
the
social
changes
that
have
pulled
cities
and
rural
areas
apart
since
the
s
have
come
to
be
expressed
in
the
party
system
writes
jonathan
rodden
a
political
scientist
at
stanford
university
american
geographic
polarization
has
emerged
in
large
part
because
our
political
institutions
have
created
a
strict
two-party
system
that
has
gradually
come
to
reflect
a
set
of
social
cleavages
that
are
highly
correlated
with
population
density
and
will
wilkinson

president

research

the
niskanen
center
a
washington
think
tank
has
added
the
filtering
sorting
dynamic
of
urbanization
has
produced
a
lower-density
mainly
white
rural
population
that

increasingly
uniform

personality
aversion
to
diversity
relative
disinclination
to
migrate
and
seek

and
republican
party

trump's
most
loyal
states
have
in
common
a
relatively
low
population
the

and

major

that

but
the
urban
characteristics
of
nashville
and
memphis
and
st
louis
and
kansas
city
are
not
enough
to
counterbalance
the
exurban
and
rural
characteristics
of
those
states
overall
more
typical
of
the
group
in
population
is
kansas
with
a
little
under

residents
last
year
and

montana

alaska
and
wyoming
a
glance
at
these
pro-trump
states
on
a
map
makes
them
appear
to
dominate
the
landscape
and
indeed
they
do
in
a
strictly
geographic
sense
they
comprise
some
of
the
largest
expanses
of
sparsely
inhabited
land
america
has
to
offer
that
impression
only
strengthens
when
you
add
texas
a
megastate
where
trump
has
not
always
been
above
approval
in
the
gallup
but
has
never
been
far
from
it
while
the
state
is
becoming
more
competitive
few
doubt
it
will
be
in
the
president's
column
again
in
tacking
on
texas
also
greatly
expands
the
footprint
of
trump's
hardcore
states
in
the
electoral
college
without
texas
their
collective
contribution
is
only
electoral
votes
with
texas
they
reach
just
over
half
of
what
trump
will
need
to
secure
a
second
term
on
the
contrary
the
other
side
of
the
coin
in
the
gallup
approval
map
is
the
group
of
plus
the
district
of
columbia
states
where
trump's
approval
was
below
in
his
first
two
years
in
office
here
again
the
morning
consult
tracking
data
generally
corroborate
these
findings
and
extend
them
into
not
surprisingly
these
have
a
lot
more
people
than
the
core
trump
as
the
below-
states
include
three
of
the
nation's
most
populous
five
california
new
york
and
illinois
and
nine
of
the
top
that
translates
to
electoral
votes
or
nearly
three-fourths
of
what
a
democrat
might
need
to
win
it
is
tempting
to
say
this
is
the
built-in
base
of
trump's
opponent
whoever
that
may
be
but
that
still
leaves
a
whopping
electoral
votes
in
the
states
that
are
not
distinctly
pro-trump
or
con
the
states
where
he
has
been
at
to
approval
again
relying
primarily
on
the
gallup
tracking
in
trump
was
able
to
pick
off
just
enough
states
in
the
great
lakes
region
starting
with
pivotal
ohio
to
win
despite
losing
the
popular
vote
by
million
votes
he
could
win
again
even
losing
by
millions
in
the
popular
vote
if
he
can
reassemble
the
same
bloc
of
states
or
close
to
it
there
seems
little
point
in
campaigning
at
all
in
the
deeper
blue
states
such
as
california
new
york
and
illinois
while
millions
of
voters
live
there
the
president
has
little
or
no
chance
of
translating
their
votes
into
the
electoral
votes
he
needs
to
supplement
his
base
in
the
rest
of
the
country
the
president
will
campaign
in
the
states
where
he
has
been
polling
in
the
s
including
previously
reliable
blue
states
he
shocked
the
world
by
winning
in
pennsylvania
michigan
and
wisconsin
he
won
those
three
by
fractions
of
a
percentage
point
each
just
under
votes
aggregate
total
all
three
states
elected
democratic
governors
in
but
the
president
maintains
a
loyal
republican
base
in
each
and
will
again
appeal
to
non-republicans
who
found
him
the
better
choice
in
he
hopes
they
hold
and
lift
him
again
next
year
needless
to
say
the
president
will
emphasize
that
strategic
handful
of
purple
states
that
have
swung
back
and
forth
in
recent
presidential
cycles
most
important
are
the
ones
he
captured
last
time
florida
ohio
north
carolina
arizona
and
iowa
but
he
will
also
be
looking
to
compete
in
swing
states
he
lost
to
hillary
clinton
virginia
colorado
nevada
and
new
hampshire
with
all
this
predictable
effort
however
trump
will
not
neglect
the
base
states
that
have
stood
by
him
most
loyally
so
far
and
he
should
find
it
natural
enough
to
enlarge
this
group
with
the
states
that
have
at
least
kept
him
near
approval
through
his
first
months
in
office
these
include
the
megastates
of
texas
and
georgia
no
and
no
plus
louisiana
and
indiana
he
has
held
rallies
in
these
states
and
stressed
their
issues
and
concerns
from
inauguration
day
forward
and
he
knows
that
without
all
these
states
on
board
all
other
strategies
and
outreach
will
not
be
enough
to
ensure
a
second
inauguration
