president
trump
defended
the
idea
of
buying
greenland
derided
by
critics
within
the
united
states
and
rejected
by
denmark
which
controls
it
in
part
by
saying
the
idea
first
came
from
president
harry
truman
is
that
so
the
short
answer
yes
but
it's
complicated
the
long
answer
trump's
acknowledgment
that
he
really
has
been
talking
about
the
united
states
buying
greenland
and
that
he
was
offended
when
denmark's
prime
minister
called
the
idea
absurd
were
the
jaw-dropping
coda
from
an
aug
report
in
the
wall
street
journal
the
newspaper
reported
that
the
greenland
idea
has
been
a
pet
project
of
trump's
for
some
time
once
it
broke
into
the
open
trump
not
only
owned
up
to
the
idea
but
said
he
was
wounded
when
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
rejected
it
as
beneath
consideration
i
thought
the
prime
minister's
statement
was
nasty
trump
said
on
wednesday
it
was
not
a
nice
way
of
doing
it
she
could
have
just
said
no
we'd
rather
not
do
it
they
can't
say
how
absurd
trump
sought
to
make
the
case
that
his
plan
to
buy
greenland
was
not
in
fact
absurd
because
he
wasn't
the
first
to
come
up
with
the
idea
the
administration
of
president
harry
truman
pitched
a
sale
to
copenhagen
in
in
a
story
told
in
documents
contained
in
the
national
archives
and
revealed
in
by
the
associated
press
but
the
truman
administration
did
so
under
cold
war
secrecy
and
no
one
learned
about
it
for
decades
there
was
no
open
bid
and
rejection
as
with
trump's
attempt
from
stettin
in
the
baltic
to
trieste
in
the
adriatic
the
situation
in
truman's
time
also
was
very
different
for
other
reasons
a
dangerous
chill
was
settling
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
following
the
conclusion
of
war
in
europe
truman
and
his
soviet
counterparts
were
arranging
pieces
on
a
strategic
chessboard
for
what
would
become
the
cold
war
that's
why
according
to
the
ap's
account
of
the
national
archives
papers
truman's
advisers
prized
the
geographic
advantage
greenland
could
afford
to
defend
against
soviet
strategic
bombers
that
might
fly
over
the
arctic
circle
toward
targets
in
north
america
the
united
states
opened
negotiations
with
denmark
about
using
greenland
and
at
one
point
the
american
side
proposed
buying
the
island
outright
for
million
in
gold
and
the
rights
to
a
patch
of
alaskan
oil
all
this
took
place
in
confidence
but
even
then
as
now
the
idea
shocked
the
danes
here's
how
the
ap's
w.
dale
nelson
described
the
national
archive
documents
account
of
the
exchange

an

greenland
seen
in
ultimately
the
u.s.
and
danish
governments
agreed
on
other
ways
to
incorporate
greenland
into
america's
defenses
washington's
use
of
global
diplomacy
was
able
to
get
the
access
the
truman
administration
wanted
without
an
outright
sale
and
greenland
remains
a
self-governing
overseas
territory
of
denmark
nato
project
iceworm
and
the
thule
monitor
one
milestone
was
the
creation
of
the
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
in
in
which
the
united
states
and
denmark
were
founding
allies
nato's
goal
was
for
western
european
countries
to
stand
together
with
the
united
states
against
the
soviet
union
an
attack
on
one
would
be
considered
an
attack
on
them
all
another
was
with
bilateral
agreements
between
the
united
states
and
denmark
over
access
to
greenland
in
the
s
the
u.s.
army
explored
using
glacial
ice
on
the
island
as
the
base
for
strategic
missiles
aimed
at
the
soviet
union
although
it
ultimately
didn't
deploy
any
missiles
the
army
did
build
a
top
secret
nuclear-powered
base
on
the
ice
pack
as
part
of
that
project
the
base
camp
century
was
abandoned
and
sank
and
one
day
it
could
be
in
danger
of

used
thule

base
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
island
as
an
important
outpost
in
the
strategic
contest
with
the
soviets
the
base
not
only
hosted
nuclear-armed
strategic
bombers
it
also
served
as
a
high-stakes
tripwire
american
commanders
expectation
was
that
thule's
proximity
might
make
it
the
first
base
that
soviet
forces
would
attack
in
a
war
so
america's
strategic
posture
within
the
continental
united
states
was
positioned
to
go
on
high
alert
if

was
