has
ended

for

nomination
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
ended
his
campaign
for
president
on
friday
morning
acknowledging
that
he
was
unable
to
successfully
pitch
his
progressive
ideas
to
the
democratic
electorate
i
feel
like
i
have
contributed
all
i
can
to
this
primary
election
it's
clearly
not
my
time
so
i'm
going
to
end
my
presidential
campaign
de
blasio
said
on
msnbc's
morning
joe
de
blasio's
exit
makes
him
the
sixth
candidate
to
drop
out
of
the
field
bringing
the
total
number
of
democrats
seeking
the
nomination
to
the
mayor
of
america's
largest
city
was
one
of
the
last
major
candidates
to
enter
the
race
not
officially
announcing
until
mid-may
even
some
de
blasio
allies
had
cautioned
him
about
the
futility
of
such
a
run
and
he
never
was
able
to
stand
out
among
the
massive
field
while
he
did
make
the
first
two
primary
debates
in
june
and
july
his
polls
and
fundraising
weren't
enough
to
qualify
him
for
the
september
faceoff
de
blasio
was
unlikely
to
make
the
next
debate
in
october
de
blasio
also
felt
a
perpetual
pull
between
his
day
job
as
mayor
and
trying
to
run
for
president
and
polls
had
shown
the
vast
majority
of
new
yorkers
didn't
want
him
to
seek
the
white
house
he
had
already
come
under
fire
back
home
for
subway
conditions
and
tensions
between
new
york
city
police
and
minorities
the
latter
is
a
subject
that
permeated
the
final
july
debate
with
protesters
interrupting
and
demanding
that
de
blasio
fire
the
officer
who
was
involved
in
the
death
of
eric
garner
just
weeks
later
the
officer
was
terminated
and
despite
overseeing
such
a
large
city
de
blasio
didn't
even
crack
into
the
top
tier
unlike
pete
buttigieg
was
able
to
do
earlier
in
the
summer
buttigieg
is
mayor
of
south
bend
ind
which
has
about
the
population
of
new
york
city
