challenge

that
just
got
harder

former
south
carolina
congressman
mark
sanford
says
he's
running
for
president
making
him
the
latest
republican
to
attempt
a
long-shot
bid
against
president
trump
in
the
gop
primary
sanford
who
was
also
south
carolina's
governor
made
the
announcement
on
fox
news
sunday
he
called
for
a
conversation
about
what
it
means
to
be
a
republican
and
criticized
trump
over
adding
to
the
national
debt
sanford
lost
reelection
to
the
house
in
when
the
president
endorsed
his
primary
challenger
who
narrowly
lost
to
a
democrat
in
the
general
election
i
think
that
the
republican
party
has
lost
its
way
on
what
were
traditional
benchmarks
to
what
the
party
had
been
about
sanford
said
in
an
interview
with
npr's
all
things
considered
i
think
the
republican
party
has
profound
problems
ahead
given
the
change
in
demographics
and
given
the
tone
that
voters
see
coming
out
of
the
white
house
he
added
sanford
joins
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
and
former
illinois
congressman
joe
walsh
as
republican
challengers
to
trump
all
three
have
little
chance
of
winning
but
it
seems
that
isn't
their
only
goal
every
time
a
president
has
had
an
opponent
within
their
own
party
that
president
has
gone
on
to
lose
the
general
election
weld
said
in
an
interview
with
npr's
morning
edition
trump's
opponents
are
well
aware
of
this
history
and
are
hoping
for
a
repeat
of
what
happened
to
one-term
presidents
such
as
george
h.w.
bush
jimmy
carter
and
gerald
ford
each
faced
a
major
primary
challenger
from
within
his
own
party
and
each
went
on
to
be
denied
a
second
term
trump's
campaign
and
allies
also
know
this
history
and
are
working
to
leave
as
little
daylight
for
these
challengers
as
possible
at
the
state
level
that
means
moving
to
change
the
rules
and
even
eliminate
or
scale
back
republican
primaries
and
caucuses
on
saturday
the
republican
party
in
south
carolina
sanford's
home
state
voted
to
scrap
its
gop
presidential
primary
while
in
kansas
and
nevada
the
gop
voted
to
replace
presidential
nominating
caucuses
in
with
an
internal
party
process
similar
action
is
expected
in
arizona
this
month
the
trump
campaign
did
not
respond
to
numerous
requests
for
comment
but
it
has
tried
to
downplay
and
distance
itself
from
the
state
party
moves
they're
more
worried
than
they
let
on
said
bill
kristol
a
nevertrump
republican
who
is
trying
to
encourage
primary
challengers
if
you
are
confident
if
you're
donald
trump
if
these
are
just
minor
irritants
you
know
what
you
beat
them
all
you
crush
them
all
in
the
primaries
and
everyone
says
wow
look
how
strong
donald
trump
is
kristol
said
if
you're
shutting
down
primaries
you're
a
little
nervous
about
how
the
dynamic
of
these
primary
challenges
could
go
kristol's
hope
is
that
one
of
these
long-shot
candidates
starts
to
gain
traction
or
that
someone
else
gets
into
the
race
with
an
even
better
chance
and
that
somehow
trump
is
denied
the
nomination
kristol
readily
admits
that's
unlikely
so
a
secondary
goal
is
to
bruise
trump
enough
to
hurt
his
chances
come
november
that's
what
happened
most
recently
in
when
pat
buchanan
challenged
bush
in
the
republican
primary
and
earned
enough
delegates
to
get
a
prominent
speaking
slot
at
the
party's
convention
bush
lost
that
november
to
bill
clinton
since
then
presidents
of
both
parties
have
successfully
avoided
a
similar
fate
today
the
republican
national
committee
is
operating
in
lockstep
with
the
trump
campaign
and
state
party
organizations
are
now
led
by
trump
supporters
as
would
be
expected
with
an
incumbent
president
the
three
long-shot
challengers
trump
has
bashed
his
challengers
on
twitter
as
three
stooges
pointing
to
their
weaknesses
and
boasting
about
his
support
within
the
republican
party
approval
he
claimed
it's
unclear
where
trump
got
that
figure
from
the
latest
gallup
polling
numbers
have
him
at
approval
among
republicans
that
figure
incidentally
is
one
percentage
point
lower
than
george
h.w.
bush's
approval
was
among
republicans
at
the
same
point
in
his
presidency
still
by
just
about
every
measure
the
republican
party
is
the
party
of
trump
and
weld
knows
that
the
trump
organization
in
every
one
of
the
states
is
the
state
republican
party
now
weld
said
weld
ran
for
vice
president
on
the
libertarian
party
ticket
in
he
is
fiscally
conservative
and
more
moderate
on
social
issues
than
most
republicans
favoring
abortion
rights
and
marijuana
legalization
in
an
interview
with
morning
edition
he
insisted
he
is
trying
to
be
president
and
he's
trying
to
get
there
by
winning
the
new
hampshire
primary
but
given
the
steep
odds
against
him
hurting
trump's
reelection
chances
would
be
an
alternate
outcome
in
or
around
february
of
this
year
i
just
felt
it
was
intolerable
and
i
had
to
do
everything
i
could
to
make
sure
that
he's
not
reelected
president
of
the
united
states
for
four
more
years
he
said
but
this
year
the
massachusetts
republican
party
changed
its
rules
for
assigning
delegates
in
a
way
that
could
make
it
harder
for
weld
and
easier
for
trump
to
win
the
state
under
the
new
rules
all
the
state's
republican
delegates
will
be
awarded
to
any
candidate
who
gets
a
majority
of
the
vote
in
the
primary
weld's
campaign
argues
that
this
could
have
unintended
consequences
that
benefit
the
former
governor
it's
an
underdog
challenge
but
the
best
ones
are
said
stuart
stevens
who
worked
on
mitt
romney's
presidential
campaign
in
and
is
running
a
pro-weld
superpac
his
theory
of
the
case
is
that
if
trump
stops
looking
like
a
winner
he'll
be
in
trouble
he
pointed
to
trump's
tweet
about
his
approval
among
republicans
taking
it
as
a
challenge
of
sorts
it
seems
to
me
if
you
get
you've
done
twice
as
good
as
he
thought
you
would
stevens
said
he's
setting
the
bar
let's
see
how
he
does
walsh
who
served
one
term
in
the
house
as
a
tea
party
republican
from
illinois
supported
trump
in
and
promoted
birtherism
before
that
but
now
he
says
he
was
wrong
am
i
a
flawed
candidate
hell
yes
walsh
said
in
an
interview
with
morning
edition
but
i
know
i've
got
the
message
that
this
president
is
unfit
that
needs
to
be
heard
sanford
brings
his
own
flaws
a
decade
ago
he
became
a
national
punchline
as
his
hike
on
the
appalachian
trail
turned
out
to
be
a
cover
story
for
an
extramarital
affair
his
political
revival
was
cut
short
when
as
a
congressman
he
tangled
with
trump
and
then
lost
in
a
primary
republican
state
parties
scale
back
nominating
processes
sanford's
nascent
run
took
a
hit
before
he
even
announced
it
when
south
carolina's
state
republican
party
moved
to
drop
its
primary
meaning
that
he
won't
even
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
state
where
he
is
known
best
i
think
all
of
us
should
find
it
a
little
bit
curious
sanford
told
npr
about
the
decision
in
the
world
of
politics
if
you
can
stack
up
a
win
you
go
with
it
particularly
if
it's
the
first
in
the
south
primary
given
the
signals
it
will
send
to
subsequent
states
and
subsequent
primaries
that
will
take
place
that
will
follow
south
carolina
but
they
elected
not
to
do
that
in
a
statement
to
npr
the
state
party
chairman
said
the
decision
to
not
hold
a
primary
was
not
about
sanford
or
any
other
challenger
to
trump
whether
or
not
to
hold
a
presidential
primary
is
a
decision
made
by
our
state
executive
committee
every
four
years
said
south
carolina
gop
chairman
drew
mckissick
there
is
strong
precedent
on
the
part
of
both
parties
to
not
hold
a
primary
when
they
control
the
white
house
a
south
carolina
state
party
official
said
there
would
be
savings
to
taxpayers
and
listed
years
when
either
democrats
or
republicans
in
the
state
didn't
hold
primaries
when
their
party
held
the
presidency
the
exception
the
year
buchanan
challenged
bush
in
kansas
the
state's
republican
party
tweeted
on
friday
that
under
its
rule
change
it
will
not
organize
a
caucus
for
the
election
because
president
trump
is
an
elected
incumbent
from
the
republican
party
arizona's
republican
party
has
a
vote
scheduled
next
weekend
and
again
the
party
chairman
insists
that
this
isn't
about
protecting
trump
this
is
nothing
new
despite
the
media's
inauthentic
attempt
to
portray
it
as
such
said
kelli
ward
chairman
of
the
arizona
republican
party
arizona
republicans
are
fired
up
to
reelect
president
trump
to
a
second
term
and
will
continue
to
work
together
to
keep
america
and
arizona
great
josh
putnam
a
political
scientist
who
runs
the
blog
frontloading
hq
and
closely
follows
the
delegate
selection
rules
for
the
nomination
process
said
the
changes
so
far
aren't
outside
the
norm
when
a
president
is
seeking
reelection
in
fact
both
democrats
and
republicans
in
various
states
have
canceled
caucuses
or
otherwise
scaled
back
the
nominating
process
when
a
president
from
their
own
party
has
been
on
the
ballot
but
you
can't
ignore
the
context
of
a
nationally
unpopular
president
who
has
had
talk
of
impeachment
and
possible
primary
challenges
hanging
over
him
for
most
of
his
term
putnam
said
that
threat
has
loomed
over
him
and
his
administration
the
whole
time
i
think
they
kind
of
felt
the
need
to
exercise
some
muscle
on
the
state
level
putnam
said
and
the
challenges
we
should
say
aren't
the
problem
they're
a
symptom
of
the
unpopularity
of
the
president
both
nationally
and
to
some
extend
within
the
party
