visitors
look

escalade
at
the
china
auto
show
in
beijing
in
for
general
motors
china
is
a
bigger
market
than
the
united
states
when
president
trump
announced
a
new
round
of
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
last
week
he
made
clear
he
was
ready
to
sever
ties
between
the
united
states
and
china
if
necessary
to
win
the
trade
war
we
don't
need
china
the
president
tweeted
and
frankly
would
be
far
better
off
without
them
but
a
growing
number
of
american
companies
need
china
very
much
and
stand
to
lose
if
the
trade
war
lasts
too
long
u.s.
firms
such
as
starbucks
nike
and
boeing
now
make
a
large
part
of
their
profits
serving
the
vast
and
growing
chinese
middle
class
china
has
become
the
largest
market
to
sell
into
for
many
of
america's
largest
companies
says
shaun
rein
managing
director
of
the
china
market
research
group
which
advises
u.s.
companies
doing
business
in
china
the
growing
importance
of
china's
consumer
market
is
often
overlooked
in
u.s.
political
debate
which
tends
to
focus
on
the
huge
number
of
jobs
lost
as
u.s.
companies
have
shifted
overseas
in
search
of
low-wage
labor
says
patrick
chovanec
chief
strategist
at
silvercrest
asset
management
who
taught
in
china
for
years
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
often
forgotten
when
we
talk
about
the
trade
war
because
usually
it's
framed
in
terms
of
outsourcing
which
yes
does
exist
but
there's
this
whole
business
of
being
in
china
in
order
to
be
in
china
chovanec
says
consider
this
to
be
sure
american
companies
still
face
plenty
of
barriers
in
china
industries
such
as
banking
remain
closed
to
outsiders
and
many
american
companies
that
want
to
operate
in
china
are
still
forced
into
joint
ventures
with
chinese
partners
intellectual
property
theft
remains
a
big
problem
but
china's
middle
class
is
now
bigger
than
the
entire
u.s.
population
and
opportunities
to
make
money
abound
there
says
anna
ashton
senior
director
of
government
affairs
at
the
us-china
business
council
the
vast
majority
of
our
companies
have
consistently
reported
and
continue
to
report
every
year
that
their
china
operations
are
profitable
and
not
just
profitable
but
more
profitable
than
their
operations
overall
she
says
the
market
in
china
i
am
so
bullish
on
it
for
the
long
term
starbucks
ceo
kevin
johnson
told
bloomberg
last
month
we're
going
to
be
able
to
accelerate
and
build
new
stores
for
a
long
long
time
in
china
but
the
ongoing
trade
war
tosses
a
new
element
of
uncertainty
into
the
best-laid
plans
of
ceos
china
has
shown
in
the
past
that
it
will
retaliate
against
companies
it
is
displeased
with
after
marriott
referred
to
taiwan
as
a
separate
country
on
its
website
the
beijing
government
shut
down
its
online
reservation
site
in
china
for
a
week
rein
says
more
recently
the
chinese
government
took
aim
at
hong
kong
companies
such
as
airline
cathay
pacific
because
of
the
political
turmoil
there
the
government
could
easily
make
life
difficult
for
american
companies
by
slowing
down
the
permitting
process
for
new
stores
or
imposing
stiff
fines
for
minor
infractions
for
example
it
could
even
encourage
consumers
to
boycott
companies
to
punish
their
home
countries
after
south
korea
installed
a
u.s.
made
anti-missile
system
beijing
ordered
travel
agencies
to
stop
sending
group
tours
there
which
hurt
tourism
in
south
korea
china
hasn't
done
anything
like
that
to
american
companies
so
far
in
part
because
it
sees
u.s.
business
leaders
many
of
whom
have
criticized
trump's
trade
policies
as
allies
rein
says
but
if
trade
tensions
get
bad
enough
beijing
won't
hesitate
to
take
aim
at
u.s.
businesses
hurting
u.s.
stock
prices
and
perhaps
forcing
trump
to
reconsider
the
trade
war
chovanec
says
if
that
happens
some
companies
could
end
up
as
casualties
trump
has
shown
little
concern
for
the
vagaries
suffered
by
u.s.
companies
in
china
chovanec
says
u.s.
companies
in
china
doing
business
to
serve
the
chinese
market
have
basically
been
orphaned
by
this
trade
war
