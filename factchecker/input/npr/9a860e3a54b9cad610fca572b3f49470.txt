the
trump
administration
has
escalated
its
fight
with
california
over
environmental
regulations
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
sent
a
letter
monday
to
the
california
air
resources
board
threatening
to
withdraw
billions
of
dollars
in
federal
highway
money
unless
the
state
clears
a
backlog
of
air
pollution
control
plans
california
has
the
worst
air
quality
in
the
united
states
with
nonattainment
areas
and
million
people
living
in
areas
that
do
not
meet
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
wheeler
wrote
california's
population
topography
weather
and
other
factors
do
worsen
air
pollution
there
but
the
state
also
is
widely
recognized
as
a
leader
in
improving
air
quality
under
the
clean
air
act
states
that
don't
meet
federal
air
quality
standards
are
required
to
submit
state
implementation
plans
wheeler
says
california
represents
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
backlog
of
such
plans
since
the
s
california
has
failed
to
carry
out
its
most
basic
tasks
under
the
clean
air
act
said
wheeler
he
then
laid
out
the
penalties
for
failing
to
meet
federal
requirements
which
include
losing
federal
highway
dollars
california
is
expected
to
receive
about
billion
in
fiscal
years
and
the
trump
administration
has
been
picking
fights
with
california
over
environmental
regulations
recently
last
week
the
administration
said
it
will
revoke
a
waiver
that
allows
california
to
set
stricter
car
emission
standards
a
senior
epa
official
said
the
two
actions
were
not
linked
and
that
california
is
the
focus
now
because
it
represents
the
largest
share
of
backlogged
plans
even
though
other
states
have
similar
backlogs
the
administration
has
not
sent
letters
to
them
gov
gavin
newsom
has
been
critical
of
president
trump's
environmental
record
and
challenged
the
administration
in
court
newsom
called
wheeler's
letter
a
brazen
political
stunt
the
white
house
has
no
interest
in
helping
california
comply
with
the
clean
air
act
to
improve
the
health
and
well-being
of
californians
this
letter
is
a
threat
of
pure
retaliation
newsom
says
former
epa
officials
say
they
were
surprised
wheeler
sent
the
letter
to
california
i
just
think
it's
so
ironic
that
the
epa
is
chastising
california
which
has
been
so
progressive
in
working
towards
cleaner
air
more
than
any
other
place
in
the
country
says
janet
mccabe
who
was
an
epa
official
during
the
obama
administration
and
now
directs
indiana
university's
environmental
resilience
institute
mccabe
says
it's
unusual
for
the
epa
to
publicly
criticize
a
state
in
this
way
she
says
typically
the
agency
would
communicate
with
a
state
privately
and
work
out
differences
to
encourage
a
cooperative
rather
than
adversarial
relationship
