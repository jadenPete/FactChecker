a
new
legislative
proposal
by
sen
josh
hawley
r-mo
would
ban
elements
of
social
media
he
views
as
addictive
as
americans
are
spending
more
and
more
time
glued
to
social
media
apps
like
instagram
facebook
and
youtube
concerns
with
technological
addiction
are
merging
with
rising
political
anger
against
big
tech
and
it's
leading
to
some
out-of-the-box
thinking
their
business
model
is
increasingly
exploitative
in
nature
and
i
think
that
these
are
companies
that
are
trying
to
evade
accountability
hawley
told
npr
the
freshman
missouri
senator
drafted
a
bill
that
would
require
social
media
companies
to
tell
users
every
minutes
how
long
they've
been
on
a
platform
each
day
further
the
legislation
would
make
illegal
the
concept
of
infinite
scroll
which
endlessly
populates
apps
with
additional
content
it
would
also
prohibit
the
auto-play
of
video
and
audio
the
big
tech
platforms
have
adopted
a
business
model
that
takes
our
private
information
without
telling
us
sells
it
without
our
consent
and
then
it
tries
to
use
exploitative
and
addictive
practices
in
order
to
get
us
to
spend
more
time
on
their
platform
so
they
can
take
more
stuff
from
us
he
said
hawley's
proposal
strikes
at
the
heart
of
how
social
media
companies
make
money
their
business
model
is
based
on
user
engagement
and
time
spent
on
the
platform
certainly
they're
using
sophisticated
psychological
measures
like
the
auto-play
feature
and
others
to
keep
people
on
the
platform
said
lindsay
gorman
a
fellow
for
emerging
technologies
at
the
german
marshall
fund
explaining
just
how
crucial
these
sorts
of
features
are
to
the
big
tech
companies
hawley's
legislation
isn't
likely
to
pass
so
far
he
doesn't
have
any
co-sponsors
in
the
senate
but
the
openness
with
which
this
legislation
has
been
greeted
illustrates
something
deeper
about
the
mood
in
washington
the
lack
of
regulations
on
social
media
companies
as
compared
to
their
power
is
nudging
conservatives
to
go
against
their
general
principle
a
hands-off
approach
to
business
hawley's
bill
would
have
government
micromanage
which
features
these
tech
companies
can
use
but
texas
republican
sen
ted
cruz
a
champion
of
free
markets
seems
at
least
open
to
it
nobody
wants
to
see
a
federal
speech
police
but
at
the
same
time
allowing
a
handful
of
silicon
valley
billionaires
to
be
the
censors
of
all
political
speech
in
america
is
a
terrible
outcome
and
so
i
think
sen
hawley's
bill
is
a
positive
step
in
the
right
direction
cruz
said
democrats
have
also
increasingly
turned
against
big
tech
but
for
different
reasons
sen
mark
warner
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
said
he
sees
elements
of
hawley's
proposal
that
he
could
support
like
in
any
business
there
are
already
prohibitions
about
deceptive
practices
basic
consumer
protections
warner
said
we
don't
have
any
of
that
in
the
social
media
world
the
rub
comes
in
how
you
define
those
practices
all
of
this
is
to
say
that
hawley's
proposal
is
more
than
a
long-shot
bill
his
proposal
represents
the
changing
nature
of
the
conversation
around
technology
in
washington
d.c.
and
a
converging
frustration
about
big
tech
that
is
bringing
lawmakers
out
of
their
comfort
zones
to
propose
unorthodox
solutions
