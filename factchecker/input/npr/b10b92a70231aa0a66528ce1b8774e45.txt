this

the
planet
money
movie
reviews
desk
is
normally
a
pretty
sleepy
place
there
aren't
a
lot
of
blockbusters
about
economics
but
we
sure
woke
up
when
we
recently
watched
american
factory
now
streaming
on
netflix
it's
directed
by
julia
reichert
and
steven
bognar
its
backers
include
participant
media
and
the
obamas
higher
ground
productions
which
is
a
partner
of
netflix
american
factory
doesn't
sound
like
a
barn
burner
disney
probably
doesn't
have
an
avengers
american
factory
in
the
works
and
yes
american
factory
really
is
a
documentary
about
a
plant
in
dayton
ohio
that
makes
windshields
but
it's
a
challenging
strange
eye-opening
film
here
at
planet
money
we've
all
been
watching
it
as
our
colleague
alex
goldmark
said
after
he
finished
it
my
wife
and
i
sat
there
and
looked
at
each
other
and
we
just
didn't
know
how
to
feel
it
would
be
easy
to
know
how
to
feel
about
it
if
it
were
just
the
thing
it
looks
like
it
set
out
to
be
the
usual
sympathetic
story
about
the
american
blue-collar
worker
with
the
expected
problems
and
questions
factories
are
shutting
down
the
unions
are
in
retreat
the
bosses
stay
powerful
and
rich
these
are
important
stories
but
they
quickly
fall
into
a
kind
of
pattern
of
hard
work
and
hopelessness
we
mostly
know
how
to
feel
it
looks
like
it's
going
to
be
the
same
at
the
glass
plant
in
dayton
but
then
a
chinese
company
fuyao
glass
america
shows
up
to
reopen
it
chinese
companies
buy
american
companies
all
the
time
at
this
point
that
shouldn't
be
that
interesting
either
but
fuyao
let
the
filmmakers
film
everything
and
so
american
factory
is
only
nominally
a
film
about
america
the
part
that
is
astonishing
about
american
factory
is
seeing
everything
about
the
united
states
through
the
eyes
of
chinese
factory
workers
and
managers
arriving
to
reopen
and
restaff
a
plant
in
the
rust
belt
american
factory
is
the
view
we
never
get
americans
know
how
they
feel
about
competing
with
china
but
we
don't
know
how
china
feels
about
working
with
america
just
minutes
in
two
workers
from
china
a
couple
stand
on
a
ledge
overlooking
dayton
they
marvel
at
the
houses
which
seem
like
antique
wonders
to
them
they
think
it's
beautiful
and
on
second
watching
i
took
a
moment
to
look
at
the
view
too
and
yeah
dayton
may
be
an
opportunity
zone
but
it's
underrated
we
eavesdrop
as
a
manager
tries
to
explain
america
to
a
cafeteria
filled
with
chinese
workers
at
long
white
tables
eating
food
out
of
foam
boxes
and
wearing
neon
yellow
vests
he
wants
to
help
them
acclimate
america
is
a
place
to
let
your
personality
run
free
he
says
as
long
as
you're
not
doing
anything
illegal
you're
free
to
follow
your
heart
you
can
even
joke
about
the
president
nobody
will
do
anything
to
you
he
also
notes
that
americans
are
very
obvious
and
that
everything
is
practical
and
realistic
any
jealousy
over
freedom
of
expression
quickly
gives
way
to
a
general
disappointment
in
the
americans
as
workers
the
chairman
comes
to
visit
and
a
manager
explains
what
the
americans
are
like
as
workers
they're
pretty
slow
he
explains
they
have
fat
fingers
we
keep
training
them
over
and
over
americans
also
like
to
take
off
weekends
the
chairman
cho
tak
wong
is
a
forbidding
presence
alternating
between
lofty
language
about
character
and
serious
complaints
about
unions
the
motherland
is
like
a
mother
he
says
in
one
address
to
the
chinese
staff
this
is
eternal
noting
that
they
aren't
there
for
the
money
but
to
represent
their
country
he
tells
them
it's
down
to
every
one
of
you
here
in
the
next
scene
he's
on
a
plane
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
labor
i
can't
manage
them
he
complains
when
we
try
to
manage
them
they
threaten
to
get
help
from
the
union
there
is
so
much
more
to
this
movie
there's
a
visit
to
headquarters
in
china
which
starts
with
the
executive
staff
singing
the
company
anthem
noble
sentiments
are
transparent
for
the
sake
of
transparency
and
it
gets
more
unfamiliar
from
there
the
directors
take
their
loving
time
with
process
too
this
is
a
movie
for
activists
but
also
for
people
who
think
it's
interesting
to
see
how
glass
goes
from
hot
sand
to
polished
windows
and
it
spends
a
few
moments
on
the
challenges
and
pleasures
of
forklift
driving
it's
not
exactly
an
uplifting
film
but
it's
one
of
the
most
interesting
ones
to
come
along

a
while
