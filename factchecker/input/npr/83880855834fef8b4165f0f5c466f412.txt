against
gop
criticism
that

the
federal

negotiate
drug
prices
interfered
with
the
free
market
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
unveiled
legislation
this
week
that
would
give
the
federal
government
sweeping
new
authority
to
regulate
and
lower
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
declared
the
bill
dead
on
arrival
and
told
politico
it
amounts
to
socialist
price
controls
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
npr
pelosi
suggested
mcconnell
was
in
the
pocket
of
the
pharmaceutical
industry
and
noted
that
president
trump
shares
her
view
that
negotiating
drug
prices
is
good
policy
as
the
president
said
in
the
course
of
his
run
for
office
and
since
we're
going
to
negotiate
like
crazy
we're
going
to
negotiate
like
crazy
so
perhaps
mitch
is
talking
about
the
president
as
well
the
speaker
distanced
herself
from
the
central
health
care
policies
of
two
leading
candidates
for
the
democratic
nomination
for
president
sens
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
and
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
are
advocating
for
eliminating
private
insurers
in
favor
of
a
government-run
health
care
system
for
all
asked
if
she
believed
that
was
the
right
direction
for
her
party
to
take
on
health
care
pelosi
was
succinct
no
i
do
not
the
speaker
is
leading
her
party's
efforts
in
congress
on
prescription
drugs
on
that
front
she
said
that
if
she
and
the
president
can
cut
a
deal
trump
will
be
able
to
get
the
votes
necessary
to
pass
the
bill
if
the
president
says
he
supports
a
path
similar
to
this
you
will
see
some
of
the
republicans
come
around
she
said
most
republicans
and
the
drug
lobby
oppose
the
house
bill
and
mcconnell's
socialist
line
of
attack
echoes
the
broader
argument
republicans
are
trying
to
make
against
the
democratic
party
ahead
of
the
elections
pelosi
pushed
back
on
this
line
of
attack
noting
that
the
government
in
some
cases
already
directly
negotiates
drug
prices
for
instance
she
noted
the
department
of
veterans
affairs
is
legally
allowed
to
negotiate
drug
costs
but
medicare
is
not
we
are
not
intervening
in
the
free
market
we
believe
in
the
free
market
pelosi
said
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
free
market
should
have
the
exploitation
of
consumers
in
our
country
with
the
support
of
the
government
by
banning
the
ability
for
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
negotiate
for
lower
prices
pelosi
told
npr
she
wanted
to
expand
access
for
health
care
but
opposed
the
medicare
for
all
proposals
touted
by
two
leading
democratic
presidential
candidates
the
speaker
said
strengthening
the
affordable
care
act
was
a
more
practical
approach

pelosi
emphasized
that
health
care
was
the
leading
issue
in
the
last
election
pressed
on
what
democrats
should
do
instead
of
medicare
for
all
pelosi
said
she
supports
expanding
the
affordable
care
act
to
include
a
public
option
that
can
compete
with
the
private
market
the
speaker
was
a
chief
architect
of
the
health
care
law
former
vice
president
joe
biden
is
campaigning
on
a
similar
policy
democrats
tried
and
failed
to
include
a
public
option
in
the
original
version
of
obamacare
we
believe
that
the
path
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
the
way
to
go
pelosi
said
pelosi
praised
the
democrats
who
are
advocating
for
medicare
for
all
and
said
she
shares
the
goal
of
universal
coverage
but
it's
not
the
practical
way
to
get
it
done
again
i
salute
them
and
if
that's
what
they
believe
god
bless
them
for
that
but
that
is
i
think
not
the
practical
path
to
getting
something
done
