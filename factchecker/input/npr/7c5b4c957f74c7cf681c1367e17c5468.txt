lawmakers
hakeem
jeffries
and
doug
collins
couldn't
be
more
different
jeffries
is
a
democrat
and
an
avid
hip-hop
devotee
while
collins
is
a
republican
who
favors
country
music
jeffries
hails
from
a
largely
urban
new
york
district
and
collins
represents
a
largely
rural
pocket
much
farther
south
in
georgia
yet
somehow
this
duo
found
common
ground
this
past
year
to
pass
a
major
policy
initiative
and
now
one
of
the
oldest
schools
in
the
country
will
award
them
with
its
prize
for
civility
in

life
they
sat
down

thursday
a

allegheny

awards
them
the
joint
prize

says

jeffries
in
a
hip-hop
reference
from
his
capitol
hill
office
this
man
right
here
you
want
to
partner
with
him
jeffries
returns
the
favor
although
i
appreciate
doug
collins
quoting
one
of
the
philosophical
underpinnings
of
hip-hop
which
is
game
recognizes
game
jeffries
says
between
collins
laughs
it
shows
you
how
much
game
doug
collins
has
at
the
end
of
the
day
as
they
sit
recounting
their
bipartisan
bond
it's
a
brief
respite
from
the
controversy
broiling
just
outside
collins
office
door
moments
earlier
a
whistleblower
complaint
against
president
trump
had
been
released
detailing
concerns
that
the
white
house
attempted
to
lock
down
transcripts
of
calls
with
the
president
of
ukraine
and
other
foreign
officials
that
release
was
followed
by
hours-long
committee
testimony
of
joseph
maguire
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
collins
and
jeffries
both
sit
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
ground
zero
for
an
ongoing
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
and
on
opposite
sides
of
a
bitter
partisan
fight
yet
they
were
able
to
score
a
major
legislative
win
this
year
their
first
was
a
bill
to
protect
songwriters
in
and
later
the
two
even
posted
a
joint
spotify
list
of
their
favorite
songs
however
their
much
tougher
work
collaboration
came
with
criminal
justice
reform
signed
into
law
in
december
that
helped
shorten
sentences
for
some
inmates

jeffries
and
collins
say
the
prize
for
that
work
is
a
major
honor
it's
reflective
of
the
fact
that
we
were
able
to
come
together
which
meant
leadership
from
doug
collins
to
get
things
done
and
make
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
the
american
people
in
both
criminal
justice
reform
and
as
it
relates
to
the
music
modernization
act
jeffries
said
and
i
was
proud
to
partner
with
him
in
that
regard
allegheny
college
president
hilary
link
says
jeffries
and
collins
exemplify
something
in
dire
need
today
civility
they
come
from
drastically
different
backgrounds
geographic
backgrounds
racial
backgrounds
political
backgrounds
and
socioeconomic
backgrounds
and
they
know
that
they
stand
at
very
opposite
sides
of
the
political
spectrum
from
each
other
she
said
but
they
also
know
that
by
finding
some
form
of
commonality
whether
that's
their
faith
their
taste
in
music
or
an
appreciation
of
what
the
other
side
for
lack
of
a
better
term
is
trying
to
do
they
know
that
through
finding
some
form
of
commonality
they
can
overcome
those
differences
to
really
make
a
difference
for
our
political
landscape
and
really
for
the
country
as
a
whole
she
says
her
school
found
a
dramatic
decline
in
students
interests
to
serve
in
public
life
in
recent
years
those
same
students
would
rather
volunteer
at
a
shelter
than
work
in
city
hall
and
that
public
service
and
corresponding
need
for
civility
must
continue
to
be
spotlighted
it
is
the
ninth
year
the
school
will
issue
the
award
i
think
what
we're
trying
to
do
with
the
civility
prize
is
really
draw
attention
to
people
who
are
not
falling
prey
to
the
incivility
and
the
demonization
link
said
so
that
we
can
present
models
to
our
students
at
allegheny
as
well
as
to
anyone
else
that
it
is
possible
to
do
this
and
to
solve
really
big
issues
working
with
someone
with
whom
you
may
not
agree
at
all
collins
and
jeffries
will
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
previous
recipients
such
as
the
the
late
sen
john
mccain
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
as
well
as
supreme
court
justices
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
late
antonin
scalia
they
met
after
joining
the
same
freshman
class
of
house
lawmakers
in
and
serving
on
the
judiciary
committee
jeffries
remembers
it
was
collins
who
reached
out
to
work
together
and
it's
that
bond
that
makes
this
duo
think
their
bipartisan
relationship
can
survive
even
a
bitter
partisan
fight
over
impeachment
we
are
obviously
in
a
very
intense
hyperpartisan
era
but
that's
not
unlike
previous
moments
in
american
history
where
there
were
intense
disagreements
jeffries
said
and
the
resiliency
and
the
power
of
american
exceptionalism
has
always
gotten
us
through
prior
instances
of
intense
internal
conflict
and
so
i'm
confident
that
the
same
will
happen
as
we
move
forward
collins
agrees
if
i
was
no
longer
serving
tomorrow
the
ability
that
we've
had
to
work
together
to
get
this
prize
together
he
said
is
just
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
my
time
in
public
service
