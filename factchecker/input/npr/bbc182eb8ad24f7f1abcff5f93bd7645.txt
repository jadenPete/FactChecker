a

prays
at
a
makeshift
memorial
for
shooting
victims
at
the
cielo

mall
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
after
back-to-back
mass
shootings
residents
in
one
houston
suburb
are
demanding
members
of
congress
finally
take
action
to
stop
a
deadly
trend
in
america
fort
bend
county
is
home
to
sugar
land
and
other
cities
where
demographics
and
political
stripes
are
dramatically
changing
and
voters
in
the
nd
congressional
district
who
have
elected
republicans
opposed
to
major
gun
restrictions
in
recent
years
may
be
considering
giving
a
democrat
the
job
in
it's
pressure
like
this
from
these
suburban
communities
in
other
parts
of
the
country
that
could
shift
the
debate
on
gun
measures
in
congress
this
fall
criticism
of
gun
lobby
i
don't
think
the
nra
is
doing
its
job
that
it
was
originally
set
out
to
do
they've
become
far
too
strident
and
second
amendment
more
guns
screw
everybody
else
said
fort
bend
county
resident
tom
a
longtime
nra
member
who
spoke
to
npr
but
declined
to
give
his
last
name
out
of
fear
for
his
family's
safety
i
don't
think
they
are
doing
a
good
job
representing
us
i
personally
this
is
really
gonna
get
me
in
trouble
i
personally
don't
have
any
need
for
the
ar-
and
ak-style
weapons
tom
who
made
the
comments
from
fort
bend
county
gun
range
thinks
if
high-capacity
magazines
behind
mass
shootings
can't
be
banned
then
it's
time
to
ban
assault-style
weapons
earlier
this
month
were
killed
and
more
than
were
injured
at
a
walmart
in
the
border
community
of
el
paso
texas
by
a
suspected
gunman
from
northeast
texas
the
next
day
nine
were
killed
in
a
mass
shooting
that
lasted
less
than
one
minute
at
a
popular
dayton
ohio
nightclub
district
the
incidents
have
led
some
texas
suburban
residents
who
live
in
what
was
once
a
solidly
gop
suburb
to
revisit
their
positions
on
the
gun
control
fort
bend
county
is
now
one
of
the
most
diverse
counties
in
the
country
but
it
wasn't
always
that
way
this
is
crazy
when
kelly
fox
first
moved
to
sugar
land
in
she
was
a
pretty
lonely
democrat
in
the
area
which
was
much
less
ethnically
diverse
by
then
the
last
of
the
texas
democratic
giants
the
late
gov
ann
richards
was
defeated
by
a
rising
political
star
from
the
bush
family
george
w.
bush
and
republican
rep
tom
delay
a
powerful
house
gop
leader
represented
fox's
district
my
husband
i
always
joke
that
we're
like
these
little
blue
dots
in
a
sea
of
red
because
fort
bend
county
well
texas
you
know
we
were
blue
and
things
changed
fox
said
during
a
recent
visit
to
a
nearby
farmers
market
fort
bend
county
in
particular
was
very
very
red
the
county
was
largely
white
in
the
s
but
by
it
was
considered
the
most
ethnically
diverse
county
in
the
state
according
to
rice
university's
kinder
institute
for
urban
research
by
fort
bend
had
an
ethnic
breakdown
of
percent
anglo
percent
latino
percent
african-american
and
percent
asian
according
to
an
annual
study
by
the
institute
fort
bend
county
is
undergoing
a
new
political
metamorphosis
thanks
to
its
newfound
ethnic
diversity
and
with
that
comes
increasing
interest
in
the
democratic
party
and
some
say
it's
a
symptom
of
a
greater
tide
turning
in
texas
last
month
republican
rep
pete
olson
the
four-term
congressman
representing
fort
bend
county
and
surrounding
areas
said
he
was
retiring
that
news
made
the
nonpartisan
cook
political
report
shift
the
nd
congressional
district
into
the
toss
up
column
in
its
ratings
now
that
more
texas
suburbs
may
be
turning
purple
or
blue
in
some
cases
some
voters
in
suburban
areas
like
sugar
land
think
democrats
could
have
the
answers
in
the
wake
of
mass
shootings
like
el
paso
where
were
left
dead
those
voters
say
democrats
are
more
likely
to
push
forward
with
plans
to
expand
background
checks
for
firearm
purchases
and
add
restrictions
on
assault-style
weapons
they've
really
got
to
look
at
things
that
they
can
do
as
preventative
measures
without
actually
taking
people's
rights
away
i
don't
want
to
take
all
guns
away
because
that's
not
what
most
of
us
are
pushing
for
when
we
talk
about
it
fox
said
it's
more
like
this
is
crazy
there
are
things
that
we
could
do
to
make
it
a
little
more
difficult
for
people
of
these
mindsets
that
are
thinking
these
ways
to
get
their
hands
on
these
weapons
that
can
kill
people
in
a
matter
of
seconds
concerns
about
mental
health
at
another
fort
bend
county
gun
range
air
force
veteran
mike
smith
says
he's
worried
he
could
lose
his
gun
smith
was
taking
his
year-old
daughter
mikenzie
shooting
for
the
first
time
after
a
break-in
at
his
richmond
texas
neighborhood
smith
who
works
two
blue-collar
jobs
is
for
some
gun
restrictions
for
example
he
thinks
the
age
limit
should
be
raised
for
owners
of
assault-style
weapons
and
some
should
undergo
a
psychological
profile
do
they
need
to
raise
the
age
limit
on
it
yes
it
needs
to
be
raised
to
about
and
then
if
you're
purchasing
a
weapon
for
your
child
your
child
needs
to
go
through
the
same
thing
that
the
parent
goes
through
smith
said
basically
let's
give
them
a
psychological
exam
not
saying
it's
going
to
be
percent
but
let's
give
it
time
to
see
if
they're
even
capable
of
owning
a
weapon
after
el
paso
eileen
huang
of
sugar
land
worried
her
community
could
be
targeted
next
she
attended
a
recent
community
meeting
on
gun
violence
for
a
nearby
democratic
congressional
district
searching
for
answers
at
the
forum
huang
who
is
president
of
the
sino
professional
association
which
represents
asian
american
business
workers
asked
houston
police
department
leaders
for
help
huang
said
she
wants
members
of
her
community
prepare
to
learn
what
to
do
next
if
they
come
face
to
face
with
a
mass
shooter
the
suspected
shooter
in
el
paso
is
accused
of
targeting
the
border
community
because
for
its
large
latino
population
if
there
is
any
training
huang
told
two
houston
police
department
officials
in
attendance
maybe
you
can
host
it
for
our
community
houston
police
department
assistant
chief
henry
gaw
told
those
at
the
forum
that
those
are
the
right
questions
to
ask
we
need
everyone's
eyes
and
ears
involved
gaw
said
i
hate
to
say
this
but
it's
not
a
matter
of
if
it's
going
to
happen
it's
just
a
matter
of
when
and
we
just
have
to
be
very
prepared
to
mitigate
any
casualties
that
might
happen
we've
got
to
do
better
by
each
other
rhonda
scott
just
moved
from
ohio
the
state
where
another
recent
mass
shooting
left
nine
dead
to
the
stafford
texas
area
to
be
with
her
son
stafford
is
also
in
the
nd
congressional
district
scott
is
not
a
fan
of
president
trump
or
what
she
described
as
his
racially
charged
rhetoric
she
wants
to
see
lawmakers
take
real
action
on
mass
shooters
and
stop
the
language
that
may
be
driving
them
to
kill
others
it's
sad
that
the
way
we're
going
right
now
you
have
to
look
over
my
shoulder
scott
said
you
want
to
try
and
enjoy
an
events
outdoor
event
and
it
shouldn't
have
to
be
this
way
visiting
a
the
farmers
market
next
to
a
bustling
first
colony
mall
fox
says
she's
continuing
to
educate
herself
on
the
politics
of
her
district
and
the
issues
that
matter
to
her
most
like
gun
control
fox
is
also
not
a
fan
of
trump
and
worries
that
his
rhetoric
has
fueled
a
divisiveness
and
a
rise
in
the
language
of
hate
for
example
she's
proud
that
fort
bend
county
independent
school
district
schools
are
designated
no
place
for
hate
by
the
international
anti-defamation
league
i
feel
like
government
can
work
in
a
positive
way
in
people's
lives
maybe
that's
idealistic
and
naive
but
i
feel
like
that
is
the
purpose
of
government
fox
said
so
everything
is
happening
now
just
kind
of
strengthens
that
feeling
it
just
makes
me
want
to
dig
my
heels
in
and
say
you
know
we've
got
to
do
better
by
each
other
and
for
our
country
as
a
whole
