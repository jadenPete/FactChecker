after
hurricane

on
great

island
bahamas
president
trump
has
promised
to
help
the
bahamas
recover
from
hurricane
dorian
the
devastating
storm
that
has
decimated
parts
of
the
island
nation
the
united
states
is
not
only
concerned
about
the
bahamian
people
but
also
the
national
security
implications
if
china
steps
in
to
help
fill
the
country's
vast
needs
according
to
current
and
former
u.s.
officials
parts
of
the
bahamas
are
only
about
miles
off
the
coast
of
florida
raising
concerns
about
the
potential
for
such
a
powerful
economic
and
political
adversary
to
gain
a
greater
foothold
in
such
proximity
the
trump
administration
officially
says
it
is
focused
right
now
on
the
bahamas
immediate
recovery
but
u.s.
officials
tell
npr
on
background
that
they're
also
concerned
about
the
long-term
impact
including
security
implications
of
china's
presence
in
the
region
former
officials
echo
those
concerns
the
concern
is
reflective
of
the
administration's
broader
anxiety
around
china's
influence
on
the
u.s.
and
the
world
from
the
economy
and
trade
to
surveillance
there
are
certainly
concerns
about
the
chinese
having
full
access
to
the
region
said
fernando
cutz
who
served
as
senior
director
at
the
national
security
council
in
the
trump
administration
until
last
year
you
could
imagine
a
situation
where
they
would
develop
intelligence
capabilities
intelligence
gathering
capabilities
he
added
and
of
course
they
could
potentially
one
day
have
a
base
a
naval
base
or
some
sort
of
chinese
military
base
that
close
to
our
shore
that
would
pose
a
very
significant
national
security
issue
for
the
united
states
the
concerns
were
first
reported
by
axios
emergency
teams
from
the
united
states
have
been
sent
to
help
in
the
bahamas
where
tens
of
thousands
of
people
need
food
thirty
people
have
been
confirmed
dead
but
the
numbers
are
expected
to
rise
as
recovery
efforts
continue
the
administration
is
encouraging
donations
via
the
center
for
international
disaster
information
website
this
is
part
of
a
broader
international
response
effort
that
includes
caribbean
partners
the
united
kingdom
and
canada
so
that
the
government
of
the
bahamas
can
provide
lifesaving
and
life
sustaining
care
to
their
people
said
national
security
council
spokesman
garrett
marquis
the
chinese
have
made
no
secret
of
their
interest
in
expanding
their
influence
in
latin
america
after
trump
was
elected
and
vowed
to
withdraw
from
the
nation
trans-pacific
partnership
chinese
president
xi
jinping
declared
to
latin
american
business
leaders
at
a
summit
in
peru
that
china
was
ready
to
deal
china
will
not
shut
the
door
to
the
outside
world
but
will
open
it
even
wider
xi
told
leaders
the
communist
government
using
its
massive
resources
and
ability
to
move
cash
quickly
has
already
become
a
force
in
latin
america
unlike
what
many
considered
possible
even
a
decade
or
two
ago
the
chinese
moved
aggressively
into
the
region
following
the
last
financial
crisis
when
there
was
an
incentive
for
latin
american
countries
to
sell
their
minerals
and
commodities
to
the
rapidly
growing
asian
power
they
have
spent
billions
building
roads
and
telecommunications
networks
more
recently
they
have
extended
their
reach
into
the
cultural
and
political
arenas
such
as
blocking
u.s.
efforts
at
the
united
nations
to
put
more
pressure
on
venezuela
john
dermody
who
served
as
a
deputy
legal
adviser
at
the
national
security
council
until
june
said
parts
of
the
administration
will
be
focused
on
the
disaster
effort
and
committed
to
the
people
of
the
islands
but
others
will
be
committed
to
looking
at
more
long-term
security
concerns
the
administration
will
see
this
as
part
of
a
broader
concern
about
china
investing
in
countries
as
a
threat
to
make
potentially
those
countries
beholden
to
china
or
indebted
to
china
and
to
diminish
the
united
states's
influence
in
the
western
hemisphere
said
dermody
who
is
now
at
the
law
firm
of
o'melveny
myers
and
i
would
say
that
the
concern
is
particularly
acute
where
the
investment
is
going
to
be
in
information
technology
and
in
light
of
the
catastrophic
damage
of
the
bahamas
i
think
that
is
going
to
be
an
issue
jos
c
rdenas
who
served
in
the
national
security
council
under
george
w.
bush
and
regularly
speaks
with
trump
administration
officials
called
the
situation
complicated
it's
very
likely
that
the
chinese
will
have
some
role
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
bahamas
and
the
united
states
does
not
want
to
be
critical
of
any
foreign
government
offering
aid
to
the
bahamas
but
he
said
the
concerns
are
real
what's
important
he
said
is
that
the
united
states
continue
its
campaign
speaking
to
the
broader
region
that
the
chinese
presence
isn't
all
sweetness
and
light
the
temptation
is
so
great
to
take
advantage
of
chinese
largesse
he
said
but
to
the
peoples
of
the
hemisphere
the
united
states
ought
to
be
very
clear
in
a
public
diplomacy
campaign
that
the
chinese
government
largesse
comes
with
a
lot
of
baggage
it
comes
with
a
lot
of
strings
attached
and
it
has
implications
for
democratic
institutions
and
rule
of
law
