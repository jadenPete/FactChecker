president
trump
returns
to
the
white
house
last
week
as
the
ukraine
scandal
was
growing
and
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
launched
by
democrats
in
the
u.s.
house
president
trump's
white
house
is
struggling
with
how
to
respond
to
the
ever-growing
ukraine
scandal
as
the
house
democrats
impeachment
inquiry
is
set
to
take
depositions
from
key
witnesses
this
week
instead
of
defending
trump
from
inside
the
white
house
all
signs
suggest
that
trump's
reelection
campaign
will
take
an
outsize
role
in
pushing
back
on
his
impeachment
aggressively
and
with
millions
of
dollars
behind
it
talking
to
reporters
on
friday
about
the
scandal
white
house
adviser
kellyanne
conway
blurted
out
a
truth
about
the
white
house's
apparatus
to
defend
trump
i'm
like
the
only
person
out
here
taking
your
questions
said
conway
whose
job
doesn't
even
technically
include
being
a
spokesperson
for
the
white
house
but
in
an
administration
where
the
president
views
himself
as
his
own
best
messenger
trump
has
been
the
loudest
voice
defending
his
actions
over
the
weekend
he
tweeted
about
the
ukraine
scandal
and
impeachment
more
than
times
it's
a
stark
contrast
to
the
last
time
a
president
was
impeached
facing
impeachment
in
then-president
bill
clinton
had
a
war
room
of
lawyers
and
communications
professionals
doing
battle
for
him
in
real
time
aggressively
pushing
back
on
the
house
republicans
who
ultimately
impeached
him
but
did
not
remove
him
from
office
the
trump
white
house
currently
has
no
similar
operation
set
up
which
conway
insists
isn't
needed
why
do
we
need
an
impeachment
war
room
when
the
other
people
have
the
burden
of
showing
why
they're
impeaching
the
president
nbc
reported
sunday
that
top
white
house
officials
including
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
are
set
to
present
plans
to
trump
for
how
to
defend
him
this
week
but
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
told
npr
the
nbc
story
is
wrong
i'm
not
sure
this
white
house
is
prepared
the
trump
white
house
communications
operation
is
sparsely
staffed
compared
to
past
administrations
even
compared
to
earlier
in
the
trump
administration
grisham
wears
three
hats
including
communications
director
and
chief
spokesperson
for
first
lady
melania
trump
i
think
this
is
just
the
beginning
and
i'm
not
sure
this
white
house
is
prepared
for
it
said
chris
ruddy
ceo
of
newsmax
and
an
informal
adviser
to
president
trump
in
an
interview
with
all
things
considered
last
week
it
doesn't
have
the
communication
staff
for
the
response
that's
going
to
be
necessary
for
an
impeachment
ordeal
it's
six
committees
opening
guns
up
on
the
president
there's
staff
that
still
needs
to
be
appointed
in
the
white
house
it's
just
not
a
good
situation
in
the
white
house
counsel's
office
the
lawyer
with
significant
impeachment
expertise
emmett
flood
left
after
the
conclusion
of
the
mueller
report
and
there's
no
indication
that
president
trump's
outside
legal
team
in
place
to
deal
with
the
russia
probe
is
bulking
up
for
the
rapidly
intensifying
house
impeachment
inquiry
well
i
thought
we
won
i
thought
it
was
dead
trump
said
on
thursday
the
mueller
report
no
obstruction
no
collusion
this
is
a
political
issue
not
really
a
legal
one
said
jay
sekulow
who
has
been
heading
up
trump's
private
legal
team
the
lawyers
involved
need
to
have
some
political
savvy
and
the
team
that
we
have
in
place
are
prepared
to
meet
any
inquiries
appropriately
another
of
trump's
lawyers
who
was
helping
him
deal
with
the
mueller
investigation
is
rudy
giuliani
who
is
deeply
involved
in
the
ukraine
matter
giuliani's
name
appears
repeatedly
in
the
july
call
at
the
heart
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
in
the
clinton
white
house
the
war
room
was
part
of
an
effort
to
wall
off
the
president
and
his
policy
agenda
from
the
impeachment
conflagration
threatening
to
consume
his
presidency
we
would
have
of
the
staff
remain
focused
on
policy
during
the
impeachment
proceedings
said
jennifer
palmieri
who
worked
in
the
clinton
white
house
during
impeachment
and
it
was
that
focus
on
doing
his
job
that
kept
him
afloat
but
it
isn't
and
donald
trump
isn't
bill
clinton
while
clinton's
trademark
was
policy
trump's
presidency
has
been
characterized
by
a
string
of
feuds
and
fights
with
everyone
from
professional
football
players
to
the
squad
to
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
battling
is
an
end
in
itself
and
impeachment
is
the
biggest
battle
of
them
all
ron
bonjean
a
republican
strategist
who
has
advised
the
white
house
says
impeachment
is
going
to
be
the
no
issue
in
washington
over
the
next
several
months
and
will
inevitably
consume
the
trump
white
house
this
is
it
this
is
all
hands
on
deck
he
said
adding
that
it
will
be
the
same
for
democrats
the
campaign
is
the
amplifier
unlike
clinton
and
former
president
richard
nixon
who
both
dealt
with
impeachment
in
their
second
terms
trump
is
facing
this
inquiry
in
the
midst
of
reelection
trump
has
claimed
that
the
house
investigation
will
help
his
campaign
by
solidifying
his
base
a
person
familiar
with
the
campaign's
thinking
says
they
do
not
welcome
impeachment
but
will
be
able
to
lean
on
the
campaign
to
defend
trump
and
shore
up
his
base
while
the
clinton
impeachment
war
room
was
on
the
white
house
grounds
for
trump
it's
in
his
campaign
headquarters
in
a
high-rise
office
building
in
northern
virginia
there
are
researchers
surrogates
and
a
rapid
response
team
boosting
trump's
message
there's
even
a
twitter
account
called
trump
war
room
the
campaign
is
the
amplifier
the
person
said
this
is
what
it
does
evidence
of
this
came
over
the
weekend
when
the
trump
campaign
along
with
the
republican
national
committee
announced
a
combined
million
cable
ad
buy
the
ads
go
after
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
house
democrats
and
are
an
attempt
to
sway
public
opinion
as
the
impeachment
inquiry
gets
going
it's
not
clear
yet
how
saturated
the
airwaves
will
be
but
it
is
a
significant
buy
this
ad
buy
is
just
the
beginning
of
an
all-out
fight
to
defend
our
democracy
and
our
president
rnc
chairman
ronna
mcdaniel
said
in
a
statement
bonjean
who
is
also
a
republican
veteran
of
the
clinton
impeachment
battle
said
to
expect
millions
more
to
be
unleashed
in
the
coming
months
putting
pressure
on
lawmakers
and
amplifying
voter
anxiety
and
fatigue
along
the
way
