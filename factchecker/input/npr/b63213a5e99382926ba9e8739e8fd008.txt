after

earlier

china's

friday's
tit-for-tat
announcements
mark
an
escalation
in
a
trade
war
that

rippled
through
the

economy
and
raised

a
u.s.
recession

my
only
question
is
who
is
our
bigger
enemy
jay
powell
or
chairman
xi
trump
tweeted
earlier
friday
referring
to
the
federal
reserve
chairman
whom
he
has
been
urging
to
cut
interest
rates
and
chinese
leader
xi
jinping
trump
tweeted
the
united
states
has
stupidly
lost
trillions
of
dollars
to
china
over
the
years
citing
the
theft
of
intellectual
property
we
don't
need
china
and
frankly
would
be
far
better
off
without
them
he
said
trump
said
u.s.
firms
doing
business
with
china
should
look
elsewhere
our
great
american
companies
are
hereby
ordered
to
immediately
start
looking
for
an
alternative
to
china
including
bringing
your
companies
home
and
making
your
products
in
the
usa
he
said
it
was
unclear
what
trump
could
do
to
force
u.s.
companies
to
make
such
a
move
the
president
has
no
authority
to
order
companies
to
pull
out
of
china
said
jennifer
hillman
a
professor
at
the
georgetown
law
center
those
companies
have
already
invested
in
china
for
reasons
that
they
chose
to
go
into
china
china's
finance
ministry
called
the
new
tariffs
a
forced
move
to
deal
with
u.s.
unilateralism
and
trade
protectionism
last
september
china
set
tariffs
on
billion
in
u.s.
goods
in
retaliation
for
u.s.
duties
the
billion
in
goods
affected
by
china's
latest
tariffs
would
represent
more
than
of
the
billion
worth
of
u.s.
goods
exported
to
china
last
year
u.s.
and
chinese
negotiators
are
due
to
meet
in
september
for
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
but
have
not
confirmed
a
date
