updated
thursday
a
m
et
president
trump
continues
to
defend
his
now
four-day
old
assertion
that
alabama
was
once
in
the
projected
path
of
hurricane
dorian
in
a
new
tweet
thursday
morning
the
president
insisted
alabama
was
going
to
be
hit
or
grazed
and
then
hurricane
dorian
took
a
different
path
the
president
then
lashed
out
at
the
news
media
saying
the
fake
news
knows
this
very
well
that's
why
they're
the
fake
news
on
wednesday
during
an
oval
office
briefing
on
hurricane
dorian
president
trump
displayed
what
appeared
to
be
an
official
national
weather
service
map
from
last
thursday
in
which
the
storm's
projected
path
was
extended
to
alabama
by
someone
using
a
black
marker
we
got
lucky
in
florida
very
very
lucky
indeed
we
had
actually
our
original
chart
was
that
it
was
going
to
be
hitting
florida
directly
trump
said
trump
then
asked
for
and
was
handed
a
large
forecast
map
that
was
the
original
chart
you
see
it
was
going
to
hit
not
only
florida
but
georgia
and
was
going
toward
the
gulf
that's
what
was
originally
projected
and
it
took
a
right
turn
and
ultimately
hopefully
we're
going
to
be
lucky
it's
heading
up
the
coast
and
florida
was
grazed
he
said
meteorologists
and
others
zoomed
in
on
the
apparent
sharpie
mark
and
reaction
to
the
alteration
as
well
as
trump's
use
of
an
old
map
was
swift
at
a
subsequent
event
trump
was
asked
about
the
apparent
addition
to
the
map
i
don't
know
he
answered
i
know
that
alabama
was
in
the
original
forecast
they
thought
it
would
get
it
as
a
piece
of
it
he
said
he
again
insisted
there
were
forecasts
in
which
alabama
was
considered
in
the
storm's
path
some
on
twitter
also
noted
that
under
law
knowingly
issuing
a
false
weather
report
is
a
violation
of
the
law
subject
to
imprisonment
and
or
fine
while
alabama
remains
out
of
dorian's
path
coastal
areas
of
georgia
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
are
under
hurricane
warnings
as
the
storm
is
now
projected
to
move
up
the
southeastern
coast
over
the
weekend
president
trump
also
insisted
that
dorian's
projected
path
included
alabama
alabama
could
even
be
in
for
at
least
some
very
strong
winds
and
something
more
than
that
it
could
be
he
said
sunday
this
just
came
up
unfortunately
it's
the
size
of
the
storm
that
we're
talking
about
so
for
alabama
just
please
be
careful
also
at
the
end
of
last
week
the
national
hurricane
center
did
include
alabama
in
its
prediction
for
tropical-force
winds
but
by
sunday
the
national
weather
service
in
birmingham
ala
clarified
that
the
state
would
not
feel
any
affects
of
dorian
trump
is
known
to
use
sharpies
to
sign
bills
and
to
mark
up
newspaper
and
magazine
articles
but
the
white
house
has
so
far
not
commented
on
who
altered
the
weather
map
or
if
indeed
a
sharpie
was
used
later
wednesday
trump
tweeted
a
map
from
the
south
florida
water
management
district
from
aug
saying
it
was
the
originally
projected
path
of
the
hurricane
in
its
early
stages
though
he
said
the
map
shows
almost
all
models
predicted
it
to
go
through
florida
also
hitting
georgia
and
alabama
the
paths
drawn
out
on
the
map
mostly
miss
alabama
the
map
also
notes
at
the
bottom
national
hurricane
center
advisories
and
county
emergency
management
statements
