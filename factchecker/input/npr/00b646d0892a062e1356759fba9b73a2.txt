sens
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
are
campaigning
on
big
structural
change
and
political
revolution
former
vice
president
joe
biden
thinks
voters
will
weigh
the
soul
of
america
as
they
decide
whom
to
support
sen
kamala
harris
is
making
a
different
bet
the
california
senator's
campaign
is
increasingly
focused
on
economic
challenges
that
as
she
framed
it
at
the
iowa
state
fair
this
weekend
wake
voters
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
usually
has
to
do
with
one
of
just
a
very
few
things
our
personal
health
the
health
of
our
children
and
parents
she
said
for
so
many
can
i
get
a
job
keep
a
job
pay
the
bills
by
the
end
of
the
month
even
though
democrats
credit
a
focus
on
health
care
and
income
inequality
as
the
reason
for
winning
back
the
house
of
representatives
last
year
presidential
campaigns
are
often
won
on
big
sweeping
narratives
defined
by
memorable
slogans
yes
we
can
for
example
or
make
america
great
again
speaking
to
npr
as
her
sleek
campaign
bus
barreled
between
fort
dodge
and
clear
lake
iowa
harris
argued
otherwise
listen
i
think
that
people
want
a
president
who
is
going
to
be
interested
in
the
things
that
keep
them
up
at
night
the
things
that
are
weighing
on
them
the
things
that
are
debilitating
and
can
be
addressed
harris
was
in
the
middle
of
a
five-day
bus
tour
designed
as
a
show
of
force
with
a
clear
message
the
candidate
is
a
serious
contender
who
could
take
on
president
trump
in
a
general
election
it
had
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
big
top-tier
campaign
swing
the
big
black
bus
with
kamala
written
down
the
side
in
yellow
blue
and
red
the
swarm
of
media
following
the
candidate
from
event
to
event
the
rollout
of
endorsements
from
high-profile
iowa
activists
harris
had
one
of
the
biggest
crowds
at
the
fair
as
she
flipped
pork
chops
on
the
big
grill
and
quipped
i
think
i
can
also
flip
republicans
but
for
all
those
telltale
signs
of
a
front-runner
harris
still
hasn't
established
herself
as
democrats
top
choice
yet
a
monmouth
university
poll
of
iowans
released
thursday
found
harris
in
third
with
behind
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
a
surging
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
in
most
national
surveys
harris
is
also
trailing
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
at
event
after
event
potential
voters
and
caucusgoers
often
sound
like
dale
liska
who
came
to
see
her
speak
in
fort
dodge
i
like
her
he
told
npr
but
i'm
kind
of
in
between
about
three
candidates
right
now
that's
fine
with
harris
i'm
going
to
keep
on
working
to
get
up
just
keep
working
up
that
list
she
said
i
need
to
keep
spending
time
with
folks
you
know
i've
never
run
before
so
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
just
don't
know
the
background
they
don't
know
our
work
they
don't
know
the
plan
harris
hasn't
rolled
out
as
many
plans
as
warren
no
one
has
but
like
so
many
other
democrats
she's
released
policy
after
policy
a
tax
credit
for
families
earning
less
than
a
federal
effort
to
boost
teacher
pay
regulations
designed
to
force
big
companies
to
eliminate
gender
pay
gaps
but
in
the
midst
of
an
election
where
democrats
are
instead
focused
on
the
intangible
qualities
of
a
candidate
who
can
simply
beat
trump
it's
telling
that
sue
dvorsky
a
longtime
iowa
democratic
organizer
and
former
party
chair
who
endorsed
harris
over
the
weekend
said
she
was
drawn
to
harris
stage
presence
more
than
anything
else
when
you
watch
her
in
a
room
she's
just
electrifying
dvorsky
said
when
she
meets
people
when
people
hear
her
she's
exciting
indeed
many
democrats
drawn
to
harris
say
it's
not
the
policies
they
like
but
instead
just
the
way
she's
gone
after
opponents
on
debate
stages
and
in
high-profile
senate
hearings
i
could
imagine
her
doing
that
to
donald
trump
and
just
cutting
him
off
at
the
knees
said
shelly
escobido
as
she
waited
for
harris
in
fort
dodge
but
like
many
other
democrats
escobido
is
out
shopping
and
intends
to
keep
shopping
for
a
while
harris
is
on
her
list
but
so
are
four
other
candidates
she
said
when
harris
has
those
moments
like
in
the
first
debate
when
she
confronted
biden
over
his
previous
opposition
to
federal
busing
requirements
she
rises
on
escobido's
list
but
other
times
when
harris
isn't
taking
as
clear
or
as
bold
a
policy
stance
as
other
democrats
she
drops
down
on
the
list
again
she
needs
to
be
more
forceful
escobido
said
i
always
feel
like
she's
she's
forceful
in
given
moments
and
then
i
always
feel
like
she
hesitates
she
pulls
back
lay
it
out
there
just
go
for
it
you
know
