hickenlooper
dropped
his
bid
for
president
thursday
today
i'm
ending
my
campaign
for
president
but
i
will
never
stop
believing
that
america
can
only
move
forward
when
we
work
together
hickenlooper
tweeted
he
had
been
urged
to
run
for
senate
in
colorado
challenging
sen
cory
gardner
in
a
video
attached
to
his
tweet
he
said
he
would
give
that
serious
thought
but
made
no
announcement
as
a
presidential
candidate
hickenlooper
had
painted
himself
as
a
relative
centrist
in
the
crowded
mostly
progressive
presidential
field
of
more
than
candidates
but
he
wasn't
able
to
gain
much
traction
he
had
not
met
the
polling
or
fundraising
requirements
to
participate
in
the
september
debate
earlier
thursday
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
recast
his
campaign
as
one
that
will
more
forcefully
take
on
president
trump
o'rourke
who
has
qualified
for
the
september
debate
has
also
struggled
and
is
now
relaunching
his
campaign
for
the
second
time
after
taking
some
time
off
from
the
campaign
trail
after
a
mass
shooting
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
killed
people
o'rourke
now
says
the
renewed
focus
of
his
campaign
will
be
about
taking
the
fight
to
donald
trump
o'rourke
called
the
president
the
greatest
threat
to
this
country

of

relaunches
his
campaign
from
his
hometown
of
el
paso
after
a
mass
shooting
that
killed
nearly
two
dozen
people
there
speaking
from
a
rooftop
overlooking
el
paso
o'rourke
said
i
don't
know
that
i've
been
doing
a
good
enough
job
to
match
that
threat
with
the
urgency
and
the
honesty
and
the
clarity
that
it
deserves
the
houston
chronicle
wrote
an
editorial
earlier
this
week
urging
o'rourke
to
drop
out
of
the
presidential
race
and
return
to
texas
to
challenge
incumbent
republican
sen
john
cornyn
but
o'rourke
never
entertained
that
idea
said
lauren
hitt
o'rourke's
national
director
of
rapid
response
hitt
called
the
editorial
frustrating
and
said
o'rourke
has
no
intent
of
dropping
out
what's
more
the
honest
reality
is
it's
really
hard
for
beto
or
anyone
else
to
take
back
the
senate
seat
if
trump
wins
by
points
in
texas
again
no
democrat
jesus
reincarnated
is
not
going
to
win
texas
with
trump
at
the
top
of
the
ballot
in
texas
and
if
trump
were
to
win
by
again
it's
just
too
big
of
a
swing
needed
hitt
pointed
out
o'rourke
she
said
believes
the
best
way
to
beat
trump
in
texas
of
course
is
for
him
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
ticket
saying
goodbye
to
a
pragmatic
candidate
on
the
debate
stage
in
july
hickenlooper
spoke
less
than
any
other
candidate
on
the
first
night
of
that
round
but
he
tried
to
position
himself
as
a
foil
to
the
progressive
front-runners
especially
sens
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
now
i
share
their
progressive
values
but
i'm
a
little
more
pragmatic
he
said
he
added
that
he
doesn't
think
massive
government
expansions
are
a
good
idea
and
argued
that
being
moderate
is
the
sure
way
to
beat
trump
in
states
he
won
in
drawing
lines
between
progressives
on
stage
hickenlooper
did
not
support
medicare
for
all
and
called
the
proposed
green
new
deal
which
would
aggressively
address
climate
change
a
disaster
at
the
ballot
box
it's
so
risky
he
argued
that
democrats
who
support
it
might
as
well
fedex
the
election
to
donald
trump
a
former
petroleum
geologist
he
has
been
a
strong
supporter
of
colorado's
gas
and
oil
industry
in
june
he
was
booed
by
california
democrats
for
saying
if
we
want
to
beat
donald
trump
and
achieve
big
progressive
goals
socialism
is
not
the
answer
speaking
to
npr
in
february
he
said
democrats
would
also
need
more
than
deep
anger
at
trump
to
win
in
i
think
there
might
be
a
kind
of
a
new
silent
majority
he
said
of
people
that
are
also
going
to
want
to
see
achievement
some
leading
democrats
including
new
york
sen
chuck
schumer
urged
hickenlooper
to
forgo
a
presidential
bid
and
instead
run
against
republican
gardner
of
colorado
who
is
considered
one
of
the
top
targets
of
democrats
working
to
regain
control
of
the
senate
recent
polls
showed
hickenlooper
ahead
of
gardner
even
as
he
was
still
campaigning
for
president
one
of
his
aides
said
the
former
governor
was
not
foreclosing
a
run
for
the
senate
hickenlooper
is
also
a
former
mayor
of
denver
and
a
successful
beer
brewer
when
he
announced
his
bid
in
march
he
touted
growing
the
state's
economy
expanding
medicaid
and
enacting
gun
restrictions
in
his
two
terms
as
colorado's
governor
standing
tall
when
it
matters
he
said
is
one
of
the
things
that
really
drives
me
