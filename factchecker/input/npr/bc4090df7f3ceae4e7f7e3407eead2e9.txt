city
president
trump
stepped
into
the
role
of
a
tycoon
on
a
television
reality
show
before
he
was
elected
president
of
the
united
states
the
path
of
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
of
ukraine
may
be
even
more
improbable
mr
zelenskiy
played
vasyl
a
nebbishy
high
school
teacher
who
lives
with
his
parents
in
a
cramped
old
soviet-style
apartment
in
a
television
series
called
servant
of
the
people
one
day
vasyl
erupts
with
an
impassioned
classroom
harangue
about
ukraine's
pervasive
corruption
i'm
sick
and
tired
of
it
he
exclaims
do
you
know
why
we
have
a
dog's
life
these
bastards
come
to
power
and
steal
and
steal
and
steal
a
student
posts
the
video
of
his
teacher's
rant
it
goes
viral
and
is
seen
by
millions
of
ukrainians
who
elect
vasyl
president
that
scripted
tirade
helped
make
servant
of
the
people
a
hugely
popular
show
that
popularity
led
mr
zelenskiy
to
form
a
political
party
called
servant
of
the
people
and
to
actually
run
for
president
of
ukraine
life
imitates
sitcom
vasyl
the
sitcom
character
was
elected
with
of
the
vote
the
actor
volodymyr
zelenskiy
got
of
the
vote
this
spring
to
become
the
real
president
of
ukraine
too
president
zelenskiy
whose
words
appear
in
the
summary
of
his
july
call
with
president
trump
doesn't
sound
much
like
the
anti-establishment
agitator
he
once
played
he
flatters
the
powerful
u.s.
president
telling
him
how
he
once
stayed
in
trump
tower
and
extols
his
political
skills
we
used
quite
a
few
of
your
skills
and
knowledge
and
were
able
to
use
it
as
an
example
for
our
election
president
zelenskiy
tells
president
trump
we
are
trying
to
work
hard
because
we
wanted
to
drain
the
swamp
here
in
our
country
you
are
a
great
teacher
for
us
and
in
that
what
you
may
see
in
his
words
is
another
performance
mr
zelenskiy
is
no
longer
just
a
sitcom
president
he
is
the
elected
leader
of
a
needy
country
that
sits
next
door
to
a
ferocious
russia
that
seized
crimea
from
ukraine
in
and
now
aids
paramilitary
groups
in
eastern
ukraine
he
spoke
with
president
trump
as
trump
was
holding
back
almost
million
in
aid
so
when
president
trump
tells
president
zelenskiy
i
would
like
you
to
do
us
a
favor
was
a
reality
show
president
telling
a
sitcom
president
in
language
from
a
melodrama
that
there
would
be
a
price
for
the
aid
his
country
so
urgently
needs
