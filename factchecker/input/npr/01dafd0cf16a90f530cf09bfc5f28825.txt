former
wives
and
partners
of
servicemen
who
survived
domestic
abuse
told
their
harrowing
stories
before
the
house
armed
services
military
preparedness
subcommittee
as
they
pressed
for
more
attention
to
and
resources
for
the
growing
problem
within
the
armed
forces
we
are
here
today
because
domestic
violence
has
become
a
forgotten
crisis
in
our
military
chairwoman
jackie
speier
d-calif
said
in
her
opening
remarks
before
the
military
preparedness
subcommittee
the
department
of
defense
must
learn
to
believe
women
and
take
action
based
on
their
claims
and
evidence
favoritism
and
a
complex
bureaucracy
cannot
shield
dangerous
perpetrators
she
continued
three
survivors
of
domestic
violence
shared
their
stories
with
the
subcommittee
they
say
the
military
turned
a
blind
eye
toward
domestic
abusers
and
in
some
cases
actively
protect
them
by
overlooking
complaints
of
physical
violence
and
emotional
abuse
kate
ranta
said
that
despite
reporting
physical
abuse
to
her
husband's
commanding
officer
he
was
protected
by
the
system
because
he
might
lose
his
pension
so
near
to
retirement
while
he
was
referred
to
a
court
martial
he
faced
no
charges
she
was
instead
told
the
issue
was
handled
administratively
but
then
her
husband
showed
up
at
her
house
with
a
gun
shooting
both
herself
and
her
father
right
in
front
of
their
toddler
thomas
did
this
in
front
of
william
his
own
son
who
was
only
his
own
son
who
screamed
don't
do
it
daddy
don't
shoot
mommy
ranta
said
by
some
miracle
we
all
lived
that
led
to
a
civilian
conviction
for
attempted
murder
and
a
sentence
of
years
in
prison
but
ranta
said
it
didn't
have
to
come
to
that
if
the
military
had
simply
listened
to
her
we
saw
justice
on
the
civilian
side
not
the
military
side
she
said
the
military
knew
he
was
dangerous
but
they
chose
to
do
nothing
about
it
army
major
leah
olszewski
was
living
with
her
air
force
boyfriend
when
he
became
repeatedly
violent
and
emotionally
controlling
while
she
was
pregnant
he
kicked
her
in
the
stomach
causing
her
to
miscarry
but
he
has
yet
to
face
any
type
of
consequences
for
domestic
abuse
with
the
air
force
inspector
general
dismissing
her
complaints
as
they
always
have
the
air
force
turned
a
blind
eye
olszewski
said
there
was
no
demotion
no
court
martial
no
consequences
outrage
was
bipartisan
on
the
committee
after
hearing
the
womens
testimony
rep
paul
mitchell
r-mich
zeroed
in
on
how
commanding
officers
repeatedly
failed
to
respond
to
domestic
violence
complaints
from
women
against
servicemen
they
don't
want
to
damage
someone's
career
they're
damaging
their
own
career
mitchell
said
they're
damaging
the
military
and
families
speier
lamented
an
abuse
of
command
discretion
that
has
been
allowed
to
fester
deferring
to
protecting
service
members
over
their
families
and
children
and
the
chairwoman
said
it
was
troubling
that
most
of
the
women
who
testified
didn't
know
there
were
resources
available
for
them
through
the
family
advocacy
program
that
exists
in
each
military
branch
a.t.
johnston
the
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
military
community
and
family
policy
said
in
her
testimony
that
hearing
the
women's
heartbreaking
stories
of
how
they
fell
through
the
cracks
is
a
call
to
action
to
us
to
better
educate
military
wives
partners
and
families
of
the
resources
to
help
you've
got
to
look
at
another
way
of
communicating
with
families
because
the
existence
of
your
resource
is
there
it's
being
underutilized
or
not
utilized
at
all
and
i
think
we
need
you
to
show
greater
accountability
speier
told
her
