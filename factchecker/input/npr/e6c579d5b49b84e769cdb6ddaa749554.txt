using
the
power

this
interference
includes
among

of
the

the
july
presidential
phone
call
early
in
the
morning
of
july
the
president
spoke
by
telephone
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskyy
i
do
not
know
which
side
initiated
the
call
this
was
the
first
publicly
acknowledged
call
between
the
two
leaders
since
a
brief
congratulatory
call
after
mr
zelenskyy
won
the
presidency
on
april
multiple
white
house
officials
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
call
informed
me
that
after
an
initial
exchange
of
pleasantries
the
president
used
the
remainder
of
the
call
to
advance
his
personal
interests
namely
he
sought
to
pressure
the
ukrainian
leader
to
take
actions
to
help
the
president's
reelection
bid
according
to
the
white
house
officials
who
had
direct
knowledge
of
the
call
the
president
pressured
mr
zelenskyy
to
inter
alia
the
president
also
praised
ukraine's
prosecutor
general
mr
yuriy
lutsenko
and
suggested
that
mr
zelenskyy
might
want
to
keep
him
in
his
position
note
starting
in
march
mr
lutsenko
made
a
series
of
public
allegations
many
of
which
he
later
walked
back
about
the
biden
family's
activities
in
ukraine
ukrainian
officials
purported
involvement
in
the
u.s.
election
and
the
activities
of
the
u.s.
embassy
in
kyiv
see
part
iv
for
additional
context
the
white
house
officials
who
told
me
this
information
were
deeply
disturbed
by
what
had
transpired
in
the
phone
call
they
told
me
that
there
was
already
a
discussion
ongoing
with
white
house
lawyers
about
how
to
treat
the
call
because
of
the
likelihood
in
the
officials
retelling
that
they
had
witnessed
the
president
abuse
his
office
for
personal
gain
the
ukrainian
side
was
the
first
to
publicly
acknowledge
the
phone
call
on
the
evening
of
july
a
readout
was
posted
on
the
website
of
the
ukrainian
president
that
contained
the
following
line
translation
from
original
russian-language
readout
aside
from
the
above-mentioned
cases
purportedly
dealing
with
the
biden
family
and
the
u.s.
election
i
was
told
by
white
house
officials
that
no
other
cases
were
discussed
based
on
my
understanding
there
were
approximately
a
dozen
white
house
officials
who
listened
to
the
call
a
mixture
of
policy
officials
and
duty
officers
in
the
white
house
situation
room
as
is
customary
the
officials
i
spoke
with
told
me
that
participation
in
the
call
had
not
been
restricted
in
advance
because
everyone
expected
it
would
be
a
routine
call
with
a
foreign
leader
i
do
not
know
whether
anyone
was
physically
present
with
the
president
during
the
call
ii
efforts
to
restrict
access
to
records
related
to
the
call
in
the
days
following
the
phone
call
i
learned
from
multiple
u.s.
officials
that
senior
white
house
officials
had
intervened
to
lock
down
all
records
of
the
phone
call
especially
the
official
word-for-word
transcript
of
the
call
that
was
produced
as
is
customary
by
the
white
house
situation
room
this
set
of
actions
underscored
to
me
that
white
house
officials
understood
the
gravity
of
what
had
transpired
in
the
call
i
do
not
know
whether
similar
measures
were
taken
to
restrict
access
to
other
records
of
the
call

the

with
mr

is
going

make
a

he
will
be
invited

look
forward

seeing
him

already
been
invited

the
white

he
wants
to
come
and
i
think
he
will

a
very
reasonable
guy

wants
to
see
peace
in

round
of
ukraine's
presidential

on
march
by
that
time
mr
lutsenko's
political
patron

be
defeated

known
his
desire

the
ukrainian
leadership
was
led
to
believe
that
a
meeting
