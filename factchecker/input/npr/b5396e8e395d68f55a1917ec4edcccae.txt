mississippi
voters
will
be
choosing
a
governor
and
other
statewide
offices
in
november
under
a
unique
set
of
election
rules
that
date
to
the
th
century
a
federal
lawsuit
by
four
african-american
citizens
is
challenging
the
system
as
racially
discriminatory
the
target
of
the
lawsuit
is
what
was
called
the
mississippi
plan
codified
in
the
state's
constitution
to
take
political
power
out
of
the
hands
of
african-americans
and
it
was
extremely
effective
says
paloma
wu
an
attorney
with
the
southern
poverty
law
center's
mississippi
office
the
constitutional
convention
was
called
after
reconstruction
when
african-americans
were
winning
elected
office
after
the
civil
war
the
framers
explicitly
stated
it
is
the
manifest
intention
of
this
convention
to
secure
to
the
state
of
mississippi
white
supremacy
according
to
the
journal
of
the
proceedings
it
was
headlined
to
keep
political
power
in
the
hands
of
white
people
who
were
outnumbered
by
free
black
people
and
their
descendants
wu
says
to
that
end
they
adopted
a
two-tiered
path
to
win
statewide
office
like
governor
or
attorney
general
candidates
must
get
both
a
majority
of
the
popular
vote
and
win
in
a
majority
of
mississippi's
state
house
districts
only
of
which
are
majority
black
otherwise
the
state
house
of
representatives
gets
to
decide
who
wins
longtime
mississippi
congressman
bennie
thompson
a
black
democrat
calls
it
the
end
of
a
line
of
notorious
jim
crow
disenfranchisement
tools
whether
it
was
the
poll
tax
or
the
black
code
there
were
a
lot
of
things
put
in
place
that
down
through
the
years
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
says
thompson
to
our
knowledge
this
is
the
last
vestige
of
southern
discrimination
in
the
electoral
process
african-americans
are
about
of
mississippi's
population
and
tend
to
vote
democratic
while
republicans
dominate
the
political
landscape
including
control
of
the
legislature
since
reconstruction
in
mississippi
the
state
with
the
highest
percentage
population
of
african-americans
there
has
not
been
a
single
black
statewide
office
holder
thompson
says
the
election
system
has
been
effective
in
limiting
the
opportunity
for
black
politicians
to
seek
statewide
office
under
the
present
terms
there's
just
no
way
that
i
could
win
says
thompson
i
could
win
the
popular
vote
and
lose
the
vote
of
the
mississippi
legislature
and
it
would
nullify
the
will
of
the
people
that's
one
of
the
arguments
from
four
african-americans
who
are
suing
in
a
case
backed
by
the
national
democratic
redistricting
committee's
foundation
the
political
action
committee
headed
by
former
u.s.
attorney
general
eric
holder
when
you
have
a
system
like
this
that
was
conceived
as
part
of
a
discriminatory
plan
and
it
still
plays
out
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
african-american
voters
to
elect
candidates
of
their
choice
that's
a
violation
of
the
constitution
explains
rob
mcduff
a
civil
rights
lawyer
with
the
mississippi
center
for
justice
who
is
working
on
the
case
the
lawsuit
names
as
defendants
mississippi
house
speaker
philip
gunn
and
secretary
of
state
delbert
hosemann
both
republicans
they
declined
to
comment
on
the
lawsuit
as
did
democratic
attorney
general
jim
hood
who
is
running
for
governor
and
could
be
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
case
in
a
court
filing
private
lawyers
representing
gunn
and
hosemann
wrote
neither
the
speaker
nor
the
secretary
wish
to
defend
the
motivations
behind
a
law
allegedly
enacted
with
racial
animus
though
they
are
seeking
to
have
the
case
dismissed
arguing
in
part
the
timing
of
the
complaint
demonstrates
it's
about
partisan
politics
not
race
mcduff
the
plaintiff's
attorney
acknowledges
the
political
nature
of
the
lawsuit
in
an
election
year
but
says
that
doesn't
change
the
argument
that
mississippi's
system
dilutes
the
power
of
black
voters
because
of
the
way
mississippi's
house
of
representative
districts
are
drawn
which
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
candidate
of
choice
of
black
voters
to
win
a
majority
of
the
electoral
districts
than
the
candidate
of
choice
of
white
voters
mcduff
says
legislation
to
change
the
system
has
never
gained
traction
i
think
we're
wasting
time
if
we
have
that
kind
of
language
in
our
constitution
we
need
to
remove
it
says
state
sen
david
jordan
a
democrat
from
greenwood
miss
i
don't
think
i
should
be
barred
by
something
that
was
part
of
keeping
me
from
reaching
my
potential
based
on
simply
because
my
ancestors
were
slaves
communications
director
nicole
webb
said
in
a
statement
that
the
mississippi
republican
party
has
no
opposition
to
amending
the
constitution
to
remove
the
contested
election
requirements
but
questions
the
sincerity
of
eric
holder's
interest
in
the
case
calling
it
a
continuation
of
national
democrats
attempts
to
delegitimize
elections
they
do
not
win
mississippi's
two-tiered
election
test
from
the
constitution
has
only
come
into
play
once
in
democrat
ronnie
musgrove
won
the
popular
vote
for
governor
but
fell
short
of
winning
a
majority
of
house
districts
he
was
voted
into
office
by
a
then-democratic-controlled
house
of
representatives
but
heading
into
this
year's
election
republicans
hold
about
percent
of
mississippi's
state
house
seats
and
a
tight
race
is
anticipated
between
republican
lt
gov
tate
reeves
and
democratic
attorney
general
jim
hood
