iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
called
for
saudi
arabia
to
reject
u.s.
intervention
during
his
speech
at
the
u.n.
general
assembly
in
new
york
city
on
wednesday
iran
is
facing
off
with
rival
saudi
arabia
in
yemen
trading
barbs
with
president
trump
and
threatening
the
movement
of
oil
but
none
of
those
things
prevented
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
from
unveiling
something
a
bit
unexpected
at
the
u.n.
general
assembly
on
wednesday
a
regional
peace
proposal
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
middle
east
is
burning
in
the
flames
of
war
bloodshed
aggression
occupation
and
religious
and
sectarian
fanaticism
and
extremism
rouhani
said
iran
could
help
secure
the
persian
gulf
region
and
guarantee
the
flow
of
oil
through
the
strategically
important
strait
of
hormuz
rouhani
said
if
he
added
those
benefits
extend
to
all
countries
equally
he
invited
countries
in
the
region
to
join
what
he
called
the
security
coalition
of
hope
a
rough
acronym
he
said
for
the
hormuz
peace
endeavor
details
about
that
coalition
would
be
forthcoming
rouhani
said
but
he
summarized
it
by
saying
peace
in
the
persian
gulf
can't
be
achieved
through
foreign
intervention
the
security
of
our
region
shall
be
provided
when
american
troops
pull
out
rouhani
said
he
added
security
shall
not
be
supplied
with
american
weapons
and
intervention
rouhani's
comments
come
after
president
trump
ordered
the
pentagon
last
friday
to
deploy
additional
u.s.
forces
to
the
middle
east
to
strengthen
defenses
around
saudi
arabia
rouhani
said
that
years
after
the
sept
attack
the
u.s.
has
failed
to
reduce
acts
of
terrorism
he
claimed
credit
for
iran
in
dismantling
isis
saying
it
did
so
with
the
help
of
neighboring
countries
and
he
said
the
solutions
to
the
the
arabian
peninsula's
conflicts
must
come
from
within
the
region
the
security
of
saudi
arabia
shall
be
guaranteed
with
the
termination
of
aggression
to
yemen
rather
than
by
inviting
foreigners
he
said
citing
lingering
clashes
in
afghanistan
iraq
and
syria
rouhani
said
of
the
u.s.
such
a
government
is
clearly
unable
to
resolve
more
sophisticated
issues
of
today
after
calling
on
saudi
arabia
to
end
hostilities
in
yemen
and
urging
the
u.s.
to
withdraw
rouhani
warned
our
region
is
on
the
edge
of
collapse
as
a
single
blunder
can
fuel
a
big
fire
accusing
the
u.s.
of
merciless
economic
terrorism
against
his
country
rouhani
said
the
current
round
of
u.s.
sanctions
against
iran
are
meant
to
keep
the
country
from
participating
in
the
global
economy
the
u.s.
rouhani
said
has
resorted
to
international
piracy
by
misusing
the
international
banking
system
since
arriving
in
new
york
rouhani
has
met
with
leaders
such
as
u.k.
prime
minister
boris
johnson
french
president
emmanuel
macron
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
and
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
he
has
not
met
separately
with
trump
but
the
iranian
leader
did
appear
tuesday
night
on
the
president's
favorite
tv
channel
sitting
for
an
interview
with
chris
wallace
of
fox
news
rouhani
telegraphed
the
tone
of
wednesday's
speech
in
the
interview
pushing
iran's
narrative
that
it
supports
freedom
fighters
not
terrorists
when
it
gives
millions
of
dollars
and
military
support
to
hezbollah
hamas
militants
in
iraq
and
houthis
in
yemen
iran
during
the
last
four
decades
fought
against
terrorism
unequivocally
rouhani
told
wallace
he
later
added
iran
is
a
country
that
has
brought
peace
in
the
region
at
the
u.n.
rouhani
said
we
iranians
have
been
pioneers
of
freedom-seeking
movements
in
the
middle
east
saying
that
iran
has
never
surrendered
to
foreign
aggression
rouhani
said
his
country
doesn't
believe
the
u.s.
invitations
to
negotiate
a
new
nuclear
deal
while
the
trump
administration
touts
the
harshness
of
its
sanctions
the
u.s.
has
accused
iran
of
playing
a
central
role
in
the
sept
strike
on
saudi
arabia's
aramco
oil
facilities
an
attack
that
knocked
out
more
than
half
of
the
saudi
oil-exporting
capability
and
roiled
markets
worldwide
last
week
saudi
arabia's
military
said
its
investigation
shows
iran
had
unquestionably
sanctioned
the
attack
iran
has
repeatedly
denied
mounting
the
attack
pointing
instead
to
its
houthi
allies
in
yemen
who
claimed
responsibility
for
it
but
saudi
officials
say
the
weapons
are
iranian
in
origin
and
that
their
direction
and
range
suggest
they
were
launched
from
the
north
not
from
yemen
in
the
south
but
the
kingdom
has
stopped
short
of
directly
accusing
iran
of
launching
the
strike
on
monday
france
germany
and
the
united
kingdom
issued
a
statement
attributing
the
strike
to
iran
but
in
a
reflection
of
iran's
complicated
relationship
with
the
rest
of
the
world
representatives
from
those
same
countries
along
with
russia
and
china
met
with
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
at
the
united
nations
on
wednesday
for
talks
about
the
nuclear
agreement
known
as
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
on
his
way
to
that
meeting
zarif
said
their
goal
was
to
preserve
this
important
achievement
of
diplomacy
the
jcpoa
meeting
was
chaired
by
the
european
union's
top
diplomat
federica
mogherini
who
said
afterward
that
the
participants
want
to
see
the
deal
fully
implemented
and
that
they
confirmed
their
determination
to
continue
all
efforts
to
preserve
the
agreement
noting
that
the
agreement
had
been
endorsed
by
the
u.n.
security
council
mogherini
said
the
pact
remains
a
key
element
of
the
global
nuclear
nonproliferation
architecture
and
a
significant
achievement
of
multilateral
diplomacy
the
u.s.
has
recently
increased
sanctions
on
iranian
figures
and
enterprises
targeting
zarif
iran's
central
bank
its
revolutionary
guard
and
its
sovereign
wealth
fund
as
the
trump
administration
seeks
to
impose
its
campaign
of
maximum
pressure
against
the
country
rouhani
said
that
despite
the
u.s.
stance
iran
has
attempted
to
give
european
signatories
to
the
jcpoa
a
chance
to
fulfill
its
terms
but
he
said
at
the
u.n.
unfortunately
we
only
heard
beautiful
words
while
witnessing
no
effective
measures
saying
that
iran's
patience
has
a
limit
rouhani
said
his
government
won't
negotiate
while
it's
being
punished
by
sanctions
the
only
way
for
talks
to
begin
is
to
return
to
commitments
and
compliance
of
the
jcpoa
and
to
lift
sanctions
on
iran
he
said
hours
before
rouhani
spoke
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
iran
is
the
aggressor
not
the
aggrieved
party
on
the
international
stage
speaking
in
new
york
at
an
event
held
by
united
against
nuclear
iran
pompeo
defended
the
trump
administration's
decision
to
abandon
the
international
nuclear
deal
saying
the
country
maintained
its
support
for
hezbollah
hamas
and
shiite
militias
iran
has
rampaged
for
four
decades
and
sadly
with
too
few
consequences
pompeo
said
as
the
u.s.
attempts
to
spike
the
jcpoa
iran
has
begun
to
suspend
some
of
the
commitments
it
made
under
the
deal
including
keeping
more
low-enriched
uranium
than
is
allowed
and
in
june
iran's
military
shot
down
a
u.s.
global
hawk
surveillance
drone
near
the
gulf
of
oman
the
u.s.
military
has
said
the
aircraft
was
in
international
airspace
