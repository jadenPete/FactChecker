the
federal
budget
deficit
is
expected
to
grow
to
billion
this
year
the
congressional
budget
office
said
congressional
budget
forecasters
are
predicting
more
red
ink
nearly
trillion
this
year
as
a
result
of
the
bipartisan
spending
agreement
lawmakers
struck
this
summer
the
nonpartisan
congressional
budget
office
now
says
the
federal
deficit
will
hit
billion
in
fiscal
and
average
trillion
in
each
of
the
next
years
the
cbo
raised
its
forecast
for
this
year's
deficit
by
billion
after
lawmakers
agreed
to
boost
spending
on
both
defense
and
domestic
programs
the
nation's
fiscal
outlook
is
challenging
cbo
director
phillip
swagel
said
in
a
statement
to
put
it
on
a
sustainable
course
lawmakers
will
have
to
make
significant
changes
to
tax
and
spending
policies
by
boosting
revenues
cutting
spending
or
adopting
some
combination
of
the
two
he
said
as
a
share
of
the
economy
the
deficit
is
expected
to
range
from
to
over
the
next
decade
well
above
the
average
for
the
past
half-century
the
deficit
would
have
been
even
bigger
but
the
cbo
reduced
its
forecast
for
interest
rates
lowering
the
government's
anticipated
borrowing
costs
by
the
accumulated
federal
debt
is
projected
to
exceed
trillion
or
of
gdp
the
highest
ratio
since
just
after
world
war
ii
the
cbo
said
the
recent
budget
deal
was
a
budget
buster
and
now
we
have
further
proof
said
maya
macguineas
president
of
the
committee
for
a
responsible
federal
budget
in
a
statement
between
the
budget
deal
the
tax
cuts
and
other
recent
unpaid-for
legislation
policymakers
have
roughly
doubled
near-term
deficits
over
just
the
past
few
years
the
cbo
expects
economic
growth
to
slow
from
last
year
to
this
year
and
about
in
each
of
the
next
four
years
swagel
said
the
trump
administration's
trade
policies
are
a
drag
on
growth
reducing
next
year's
gross
domestic
product
by
an
estimated
tariffs
reduce
domestic
gdp
mostly
by
raising
domestic
prices
thereby
reducing
the
purchasing
power
of
consumers
and
increasing
the
cost
of
business
investment
swagel
said
tariffs
also
affect
business
investment
by
increasing
uncertainty
about
future
barriers
to
trade
