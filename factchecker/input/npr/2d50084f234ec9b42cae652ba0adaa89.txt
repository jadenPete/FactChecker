president
trump
speaks
to
supporters
at
a
rally
in
manchester
on
thursday
in
manchester
n.h.
at
his
first
campaign
rally
after
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
president
trump
appeared
to
back
away
from
supporting
a
possible
expansion
of
background
checks
in
favor
of
a
push
for
more
attention
to
mental
illness
there
is
a
mental
illness
problem
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
person
holding
the
gun
trump
said
to
roars
and
a
standing
ovation
from
the
manchester
n.h.
crowd
trump
used
a
similar
line
immediately
after
the
dual
shootings
earlier
this
month
at
a
walmart
in
texas
and
outside
a
bar
in
ohio
saying
that
mental
illness
and
hatred
pulls
the
trigger
not
the
gun
in
the
weeks
since
the
president
has
urged
congress
to
strengthen
background
checks
despite
opposition
from
the
national
rifle
association
he
backed
red
flag
laws
which
would
permit
law
enforcement
officers
to
temporarily
take
weapons
away
from
people
determined
to
be
a
danger
to
themselves
or
others
republicans
and
democrats
must
come
together
and
get
strong
background
checks
perhaps
marrying
this
legislation
with
desperately
needed
immigration
reform
trump
tweeted
just
after
the
deadly
attacks
which
happened
within
a
hour
span
we
will
see
where
nra
will
be
but
we
need
meaningful
background
checks
trump
said
just
last
week
adding
that
on
background
checks
we
have
tremendous
support
for
really
common-sense
sensible
important
background
checks
but
at
the
rally
trump
didn't
mention
any
of
those
policies
as
he
was
heading
to
new
hampshire
on
thursday
trump
first
signaled
he
was
pivoting
to
mental
health
despite
the
fact
that
authorities
say
that
the
alleged
el
paso
shooter
was
motivated
by
a
white
supremacist
ideology
and
a
desire
to
kill
mexicans
we
don't
want
to
see
crazy
people
owning
guns
the
president
said
to
reporters
in
new
hampshire
he
told
the
crowd
that
there
was
a
need
to
build
new
facilities
for
those
in
need
similar
to
mental
institutions
that
were
shut
down
decades
ago
we
will
be
taking
mentally
deranged
and
dangerous
people
off
the
streets
so
we
won't
have
to
worry
so
much
about
that
trump
said
we
can't
make
it
harder
for
good
solid
law
abiding
citizens
to
protect
themselves
we
will
always
uphold
the
right
to
self
defense
and
we
will
always
uphold
the
nd
amendment
the
president
went
on
to
pledge
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
rebuffed
calls
from
democrats
to
end
the
august
recess
early
and
call
senators
back
to
tackle
gun
violence
he
has
instead
said
lawmakers
should
use
this
time
back
home
to
think
through
proposals
and
that
the
senate
will
debate
the
issues
in
september
he
expects
background
checks
assault
weapons
and
red
flag
laws
to
be
part
of
that
debate
