feeling
sluggish
having
trouble
achieving
and
maintaining
productivity
growth
does
it
feel
like
investment
will
never
ever
go
up
you
may
be
experiencing
secular
stagnation
symptoms
include
persistently
low
interest
rates
and
weak
inflation
also
mediocre
economic
growth
despite
a
diet
of
huge
deficits
and
cheap
credit
it
may
be
time
to
consult
a
former
u.s.
treasury
secretary
in
larry
summers
gave
a
speech
at
the
international
monetary
fund
offering
an
explanation
for
what
seems
like
never-ending
sluggishness
in
the
economy
summers
who
is
currently
a
professor
at
harvard
kennedy
school
has
been
a
u.s.
treasury
secretary
the
president
of
harvard
head
of
the
national
economic
council
and
we
could
keep
going
ever
since
that
speech
at
the
imf
he's
been
using
his
microphone
to
say
we're
witnessing
a
period
of
secular
stagnation
it's
a
term
coined
by
an
economist
alvin
hansen
in
the
s
we
spoke
with
summers
about
it
this
q
a
has
been
edited
for
clarity
in
you
resurrected
this
pretty
wonky
and
obscure
term
secular
stagnation
from
the
s
first
in
plain
terms
what
is
secular
stagnation
secular
stagnation
is
a
situation
where
the
private
sector
of
an
economy
has
a
tendency
to
save
a
great
deal
and
a
limited
propensity
to
invest
so
that
there's
all
this
cash
that
needs
to
be
absorbed
and
trouble
in
absorbing
it
interest
rates
fall
to
low
levels
growth
has
a
tendency
to
be
sluggish
and
inflation
has
a
tendency
to
decline
and
that's
not
a
temporary
cyclical
situation
it's
a
secular
or
longer
term
situation
unless
policy
intervenes
very
strongly
so
on
important
measures
and
i
mean
we
hear
this
all
the
time
the
economy
looks
good
what
are
the
specific
aspects
or
measures
of
the
economy
that
concern
you
yes
the
vehicle
is
moving
along
reasonably
well
but
in
order
to
get
it
to
move
along
reasonably
well
we
have
to
have
the
accelerator
on
the
floor
with
epically
low
interest
rates
with
extremely
high
levels
of
borrowing
and
inflated
asset
prices
and
with
very
very
large
for
peacetime
unprecedented
levels
of
budget
deficits
that
are
only
projected
to
increase
and
so
it's
not
that
the
economy
is
stagnant
it's
that
in
order
to
keep
it
moving
we
need
to
make
extraordinary
steps
and
those
extraordinary
steps
raise
questions
about
what
we'll
do
when
the
next
recession
comes
we
essentially
won't
have
room
to
cut
interest
rates
what
in
your
view
is
the
cause
or
causes
of
secular
stagnation
more
inequality
longer
retirement
periods
more
uncertainty
all
cause
the
household
sector
to
save
more
investment
is
reduced
by
a
more
slowly
growing
labor
force
by
much
cheaper
capital
goods
by
changes
in
technology
and
tastes
people
for
example
want
to
live
in
apartments
in
cities
rather
than
big
houses
in
the
suburbs
law
firms
used
to
require
square
feet
of
space
per
lawyer
now
they
require
square
feet
of
space
per
lawyer
because
they
no
longer
need
filing
cabinets
there's
no
longer
a
need
for
malls
because
of
e-commerce
all
of
this
attenuates
investment
even
as
saving
goes
up
and
the
result
is
extreme
downwards
pressure
on
interest
rates
we
recently
published
a
newsletter
about
secular
stagnation
and
it
got
quite
a
few
responses
one
commenter
framed
this
trend
in
terms
of
the
end
of
growth
he
wrote
maybe
just
maybe
and
hear
me
out
here
an
economy
that
relies
on
the
extraction
of
physical
materials
from
a
physical
system
is
physically
limited
and
cannot
grow
indefinitely
is
it
wrong
to
believe
that
growth
can
continue
forever
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
it
can
and
perhaps
the
strongest
evidence
is
that
commodity
prices
on
average
have
trended
downwards
and
if
they
were
all
being
exhausted
and
consumed
you'd
expect
them
to
be
becoming
scarcer
and
that
they
would
trend
upwards
but
the
result
has
been
that
better
exploration
better
extraction
technologies
better
ways
of
using
commodities
efficiently
has
done
more
to
perpetuate
the
supply
than
depletion
has
done
to
run
the
supply
out
and
the
best
forecast
looking
ahead
i
think
suggests
that
those
trends
are
likely
to
continue
back
in
when
you
first
raised
the
specter
of
secular
stagnation
i
recall
people
saying
oh
this
is
just
larry
summers
making
excuses
for
the
track
record
of
the
obama
administration
we
interviewed
former
trump
economic
adviser
kevin
hassett
and
he
basically
said
that
the
real
problem
is
there's
all
this
red
tape
on
corporations
and
that
was
his
argument
for
the
tax
cuts
and
jobs
act
that
if
we
lower
the
tax
rate
on
corporations
that
will
spur
investment
but
if
you
look
at
the
data
investment
hasn't
come
roaring
back
where
do
you
see
the
debate
now
in
macroeconomics
relative
to
what
the
consensus
thought
in
we
have
far
lower
interest
rates
that
should
have
accelerated
the
economy
more
than
people
expected
we
have
far
higher
budget
deficits
that
should
have
accelerated
the
economy
relative
to
what
people
expected
then
we
had
far
more
so-called
supply
side
tax
cuts
than
people
expected
then
that
should
have
accelerated
the
economy
and
we've
had
three
years
of
donald
trump's
deregulation
that
should
have
accelerated
the
economy
on
the
conventional
wisdom
and
yet
whether
you
look
at
inflation
or
whether
you
look
at
the
growth
of
gdp
it's
been
much
slower
than
people
expected
so
when
you
push
all
the
pedals
and
pull
all
the
levers
harder
than
anybody
expected
and
the
vehicle
goes
slower
than
anybody
expected
then
you
know
that
something's
wrong
so
i
think
the
evidence
for
secular
stagnation
is
far
clearer
today
than
it
was
in
