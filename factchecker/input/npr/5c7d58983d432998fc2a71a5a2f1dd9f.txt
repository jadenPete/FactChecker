hall
event
on

in
aiken
s.c.
back
in
april
things
looked
a
little
different
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
elizabeth
warren's
first-quarter
fundraising
was
disappointing
she
was
eschewing
big-money
fundraisers
and
her
campaign
was
spending
a
lot
cents
of
every
dollar
it
was
taking
in
on
or
so
staffers
in
early
states
setting
up
a
big
campaign
was
starting
to
look
like
a
high-risk
gamble
that
wasn't
paying
off
for
the
massachusetts
senator
she
was
not
polling
very
well
down
around
in
fifth
place
and
struggling
to
get
out
of
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
shadow
as
they
competed
for
the
progressive
left
but
times
have
changed
warren
is
now
surging
she
has
plugged
away
with
plans
retail
campaigning
more
than
selfies
so
far
and
two
solid
debate
performances
as
a
result
she's
raked
in
million
still
without
big-money
fundraisers
and
more
than
doubled
her
support
polling
consistently
second
or
third
nationally
and
on
sunday
she
drew
her
largest
crowd
of
the
campaign
yet
in
seattle
that
even
got
the
attention
monday
of
president
trump
rising
to
his
focus
is
perhaps
one
of
the
better
weather
vanes
of
who's
doing
well
in
the
democratic
primary
surveys
in
some
crucial
early
states
also
show
warren
within
striking
distance
second
place
in
iowa
behind
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
third
in
new
hampshire
but
questions
linger
about
her
long-term
chances
following
hillary
clinton's
loss
to
donald
trump
in
voters
on
the
campaign
trail
continue
to
say
they
like
warren
but
they
aren't
sure
she
can
win
it's
something
researchers
and
democratic
strategists
think
she
can
get
past
and
they
say
her
rise
might
be
proving
the
naysayers
wrong
already
she's
so
good
at
explaining
her
ideas
in
a
way
that
makes
sense
to
the
audience
said
karen
finney
a
democratic
strategist
who
worked
on
the
hillary
clinton
presidential
campaign
and
stacey
abrams
georgia
bid
for
governor
but
is
not
currently
affiliated
with
any
presidential
campaign
and
she's
winning
people
over
the
challenge
will
be
all
the
money
that
will
be
spent
to
make
her
ideas
sound
scary
debbie
walsh
director
of
the
center
for
american
women
and
politics
at
rutgers
university
said
the
questions
about
warren's
electability
are
something
of
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
in
some
ways
it
seems
like
it's
a
story
that
is
self-perpetuating
walsh
said
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
say
they're
enthusiastic
about
her
but
afraid
others
aren't
and
that
creates
this
notion
that
she
or
a
woman
in
general
won't
become
electable

warren's
rise

what's
more
since
may
warren
has
gotten
more
popular
while
biden
has
gotten
slightly
less
popular
and
sanders
is
about
where
he's
been
more
democrats
have
an
opinion
of
biden
and
sanders
than
they
do
of
warren
meaning
warren
has
some
room
to
grow
democratic
polling
has
also
found
warren
is
democratic
voters
magic-wand
choice
according
to
a
survey
from
avalanche
strategy
in
other
words
she
may
not
be
leading
in
the
polls
but
she's
the
one
more
democrats
want
to
actually
be
president
if
they
could
pick
someone
biden
led
in
the
horse-race
choice
with
sanders
was
second
with
and
warren
was
third
with
but
when
it
came
to
asking
them
who
they
would
make
president
with
a
magic
wand
biden
dropped
points
to
and
warren
jumped
points
to
the
poll
was
conducted
before
the
first
rounds
of
debates
and
democratic
voters
gave
warren
top
marks
for
her
performance
in
them
the
poll
however
also
found
some
doubt
among
democratic
voters
almost
said
it
was
extremely
important
to
beat
president
trump
but
their
confidence
that
a
democrat
would
win
was
a
different
story
less
than
a
third
said
they
believed
the
likely
democratic
nominee
would
certainly
win
republicans
on
the
other
hand
were
far
more
locked
in
believing
president
trump
will
win
reelection
said
trump
would
certainly
win
what
explains
this
gap
largely
gender
the
poll
asked
respondents
what
their
magic
wand
candidate
could
do
to
make
them
more
electable
the
researchers
looked
specifically
for
mentions
of
many
qualities
frequently
discussed
as
potentially
driving
electability
including
ideology
age
race
sexual
orientation
and
gender
gender
is
mentioned
the
most
of
any
factor
and
get
this
among
the
respondents
who
mention
gender
are
female
some
of
the
respondents
said
things
like
i'm
not
sure
a
woman
can
beat
trump
honestly
the
misogyny
and
racism
in
this
country
right
now
is
heartbreaking
i
hope
one
day
she's
president
though
she
is
amazing
said
a
year-old
female
from
kentucky
i
don't
know
i
don't
think
men
will
vote
for
her
or
any
woman
said
a
year-old
female
from
north
carolina
part
of
warren's
challenge
and
opportunity
is
to
convince
women
that
she
is
electable
women
have
been
a
driving
force
behind
the
resistance
to
president
trump
they
were
the
fuel
to
taking
back
the
house
in
the
midterm
elections
and
they
make
up
a
strong
majority
of
democratic
voters
in
the
primary
for
example
women
made
up
of
democratic
primary
voters
and
caucusgoers
according
to
exit
polls
it's
a
similar
potential
path
for
president
barack
obama's
victory
over
clinton
in
the
primary
key
to
his
win
was
convincing
african
americans
that
white
voters
would
back
him
after
winning
the
iowa
caucuses
which
were
more
than
white
obama
took
off
with
black
voters
leading
to
his
crucial
victory
in
south
carolina
michiah
prull
ceo
of
avalanche
strategy
and
the
former
field
director
of
obama's
florida
campaign
in
points
out
that
warren
seems
to
be
starting
to
convince
democrats
that
she
can
win
her
rise
is
very
likely
due
to
an
increased
belief
that
she
is
viable
prull
said
it
really
is
that
perception
of
other
people's
perception
it's
a
concern
that
other
people
would
not
support
a
female
candidate
if
we
see
warren
really
rising
that
likely
indicates
a
shift
in
how
people
are
perceiving
how
electable
she
is
the
hillary
clinton
factor
a
lot
of
the
trepidation
about
whether
warren
can
win
stems
from
the
results
of
the
election
where
hillary
clinton
lost
to
president
trump
despite
winning
million
more
votes
that's
something
walsh
said
that
is
short-sighted
it's
this
idea
that
women
are
risky
because
one
woman
lost
her
election
for
president
of
the
united
states
walsh
said
and
yet
we're
looking
back
at
an
election
like
where
democrats
did
pretty
well
by
having
women
candidates
they
had
a
pretty
good
return
on
investment
women
were
responsible
for
flipping
the
house
from
red
to
blue
finney
points
out
that
clinton's
run
as
the
first
woman
to
be
a
major-party
nominee
may
have
actually
helped
lay
the
groundwork
that
would
help
a
woman
win
the
white
house
in
the
future
there's
something
different
about
being
the
second
not
the
first
finney
said
as
the
first
to
run
and
win
the
nomination
hillary
bore
a
lot
of
the
brunt
of
and
showed
it
was
possible
walsh
agrees
noting
that
if
warren
were
to
win
the
nomination
she
would
have
the
benefit
of
having
a
woman
run
before
hillary
clinton
did
not
but
above
all
warren
just
isn't
clinton
at
the
beginning
walsh
said
of
warren
there
was
this
narrative
of
her
being
school
marm
and
that's
faded
because
she
comes
bounding
out
in
this
just
enthusiastic
whatever-your-problem-i've-got-a-plan-for-that
way
enthusiasm
exudes
from
her
clinton
on
the
other
hand
had
built
more
of
a
protective
barrier
between
herself
and
the
public
and
some
of
that
is
totally
understandable
walsh
noted
given
attacks
over
decades
from
the
right
but
there
was
a
cautiousness
about
her
that
you
don't
necessarily
feel
with
elizabeth
warren
there
are
still
lots
of
questions
about
warren's
candidacy
in
particular
how
will
she
handle
the
inevitable
scrutiny
from
all
sides
that
comes
with
a
rise
in
the
polls
but
walsh
thinks
democrats
should
focus
on
a
different
e
word
over
electability
enthusiasm
there
is
this
panic
mode
on
the
democratic
side
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
win
the
election
she
said
but
i
don't
know
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
someone
lukewarm
does
it
and
gets
someone
to
turn
out
at
the
polls
