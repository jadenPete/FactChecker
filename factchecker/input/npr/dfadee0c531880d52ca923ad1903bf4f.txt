and
who
has
close
relatives
in
the
west
bank

omar
apparently
in
response
to
tweets
from
trump
saying
that

hate
israel
all
jewish
people

that
israel
would
show
great
weakness
by
letting

he
said
israel
does
not

us
how
the
israeli
occupation
treats
us
they
want
our
lives
to
be
a
secret
tlaib's
uncle
said
he
added
that
the
trip
would
have
showed
the
realities
of
the
west
bank
and
that
now
israel
and
the
u.s.
won
my
family
and
i
have
cried
together

promised
to
keep
my
grandmother
alive
until
i
can
one
day
reunite
with
her

with
their
strength
and
heart
that

am
a
duly
elected
united
states
congresswoman
and
i
will
not
allow
the
israeli
government
to
humiliate
me
and
my
family
or
take
away
our
right
to
speak
out
nour
odeh
who
helped
to
plan
the
original
trip
for
the
congresswomen
told
npr
that
tlaib's
experience
reflects
a
reality
facing
palestinians
palestinians
of
all
walks
of
life
are
put
in
the
impossible
situation
of
having
to
choose
between
championing
their
principles
between
defending
their
cause
for
freedom
between
speaking
their
mind
and
enjoying
the
basic
humanitarian
conditions
that
everybody
is
entitled
to
including
having
access
to
their
families
she
said
there
was
no
word
on
whether
israel
had
changed
its
position
on
omar
a
somali-born
american
she
had
been
scheduled
to
arrive
on
saturday
in
israel
where
she
and
tlaib
planned
to
tour
the
west
bank
and
visit
the
al-aqsa
mosque
in
jerusalem
tlaib
and
omar
were
to
have
traveled
under
the
auspices
of
the
palestinian
initiative
for
the
promotion
of
global
dialogue
and
democracy
or
miftah
a
ramallah-based
nongovernmental
organization
promoting
an
independent
palestinian
state
earlier
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
said
in
a
lengthy
statement
that
the
trip
sought
to
harm
israel
and
increase
incitement
against
it
israel
initially
barred
the
congresswomen's
visit
on
the
basis
of
a
law
that
allows
authorities
to
ban
advocates
of
a
palestinian-led
movement
to
boycott
israel
the
move
elicited
a
strong
backlash
from
individuals
in
both
parties
democratic
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
called
the
move
deeply
disappointing
florida
republican
sen
marco
rubio
tweeted
that
while
he
disagreed
with
rep
tlaib
omar
on
israel
denying
them
entry
to
israel
is
a
mistake
even
aipac
the
powerful
pro-israel
lobby
group
tweeted
that
every
member
of
congress
should
be
able
to
visit
and
experience
our
democratic
ally
israel
firsthand
