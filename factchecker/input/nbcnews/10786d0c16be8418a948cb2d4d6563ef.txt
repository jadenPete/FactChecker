washington
former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton's
abrupt
departure
on
tuesday
came
after
president
donald
trump
suggested
he
might
lift
some
u.s.
sanctions
on
iran
as
an
incentive
for
tehran
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
according
to
a
person
close
to
bolton
this
person
said
trump
raised
the
idea
of
lifting
sanctions
during
a
discussion
with
bolton
in
the
oval
office
on
monday
afternoon
bolton
made
clear
to
the
president
that
he
strongly
disagreed
with
the
idea
this
person
said
bolton
was
out
as
national
security
adviser
the
following
morning
though
he
and
trump
disagree
over
who
made
that
decision
the
president
has
said
he
fired
him
while
bolton
has
said
he
resigned
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
as
national
security
adviser
bolton
was
a
leading
advocate
of
the
trump
administration's
so-called
maximum
pressure
campaign
designed
to
squeeze
iran's
economy
until
its
leadership
was
forced
to
curtail
its
aggression
in
the
region
and
concede
to
u.s.
demands
to
dismantle
its
nuclear
program
trump
withdrew
the
u.s.
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
last
year
iran
has
since
decided
not
to
comply
with
the
agreement
trump
recently
has
said
he
would
meet
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
perhaps
later
this
month
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
session
in
new
york
without
preconditions
iran
has
said
it
won't
negotiate
with
the
u.s.
until
sanctions
are
lifted
this
was
not
the
first
time
trump
has
brought
up
the
idea
of
easing
sanctions
to
bring
iran
to
the
negotiating
table
according
to
a
u.s.
official
familiar
with
the
iran
policy
discussions
the
president
has
thrown
out
the
idea
before
because
he
believes
if
he
gets
iranian
officials
to
talk
he
can
make
a
deal
but
the
discussion
on
monday
was
more
than
just
a
suggestion
the
official
said
as
the
president
seemed
to
really
be
considering
the
idea
ahead
of
a
hoped-for
meeting
with
the
iranians
at
the
united
nations
later
this
month
french
president
emmanuel
macron
has
proposed
providing
iran
with
billion
in
non-u
s.
funds
to
jump-start
talks
trump
has
suggested
he
might
sign
off
on
such
a
proposal
which
would
require
the
u.s.
to
advise
financial
institutions
that
they
would
not
face
penalties
if
they
facilitate
such
transactions

but
the
person
close
to
bolton
said
the
president
went
further
during
a
p
m
meeting
on
monday
in
suggesting
he
would
lift
u.s.
sanctions
the
possibility
of
iran
sanctions
relief
was
in
part
what
prompted
bolton
to
submit
a
resignation
letter
to
the
president
the
following
morning
this
person
said
trump
indicated
on
wednesday
that
he
might
be
open
to
sanctions
relief
we'll
see
what
happens
he
told
reporters
when
asked
about
possibly
easing
sanctions
on
iran
