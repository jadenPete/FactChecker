the

of
life

in
the

hits
stores
in
october
washington
a
former
cia
officer
who
says
she
spent
years
under
deep
cover
has
written
what
appears
to
be
one
of
the
most
revealing
memoirs
ever
put
to
paper
by
an
american
intelligence
operative
a
book
so
intriguing
that
apple
bought
the
television
rights
even
before
its
october
publication
date
but
the
book
life
undercover
coming
of
age
in
the
cia
by
amaryllis
fox
has
become
embroiled
in
dual
controversies
some
former
cia
officers
who
have
learned
about
its
contents
are
questioning
its
veracity
saying
key
details
don't
ring
true
some
are
casting
doubt
on
the
book's
climactic
scene
fox's
recounting
of
a
dramatic
solo
meeting
she
says
she
had
in
karachi
pakistan
with
al
qaeda-linked
extremists
and
in
an
extraordinary
move
fox
submitted
her
memoir
to
publisher
knopf
doubleday
without
getting
approval
from
the
cia's
publication
review
board
in
violation
of
the
nondisclosure
agreement
every
agency
officer
signs
according
to
three
u.s.
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
that
agreement
says
the
cia
must
review
anything
a
former
officer
writes
about
intelligence
matters
to
insure
that
she
is
not
revealing
secrets
or
endangering
lives
the
cia
says
it
must
complete
the
review
before
the
material
is
shared
with
publishers
blog-subscribers
a
tv
audience
ghost-writers
co-authors
editors
family
members
assistants
representatives
or
anyone
else
not
authorized
to
receive
or
review
such
classified
information
fox
has
given
the
manuscript
to
the
agency
but
has
not
received
approval
for
publication
the
cia
had
no
immediate
comment
paul
bogaards
a
spokesman
for
knopf
doubleday
told
nbc
news
fox
has
written
a
rich
and
resonant
work
about
the
path
one
takes
and
the
duty
one
assumes
to
live
a
life
of
service
and
honor
to
country
an
excerpt
of
the
book
has
appeared
in
vogue
magazine
and
a
review
copy
has
circulated
widely
including
to
nbc
news
it
contains
the
sort
of
details
the
cia
has
censored
from
previous
memoirs
for
example
fox
writes
about
posing
as
an
international
art
dealer
while
living
in
shanghai
and
seeking
to
infiltrate
nuclear
weapons
procurement
networks
in
europe
and
the
middle
east
she
offers
details
about
how
the
cia
uses
secret
software
covcom
for
covert
communications
to
message
sources
in
foreign
countries
she
describes
disguises
surveillance
avoidance
techniques
and
how
the
cia
obtained
false
identifications
from
motor
vehicle
and
passport
agencies
the
details
are
particularly
sensitive
because
fox
says
she
operated
under
nonofficial
cover
meaning
she
posed
as
a
private
citizen
not
a
diplomat
so-called
nocs
put
themselves
at
greater
risk
because
they
lack
diplomatic
immunity
and
can
be
arrested
and
jailed
if
caught
spying
the
cia
doesn't
discuss
how
it
uses
nocs
nor
does
the
agency
typically
allow
officers
to
name
countries
in
which
they
operated
other
than
war
zones
fox
who
is
now
married
to
a
grandson
of
robert
f.
kennedy
acknowledged
to
nbc
news
that
the
advance
copy
did
not
have
final
approval
from
the
cia
but
she
said
she
submitted
a
manuscript
more
than
a
year
ago
and
the
agency
has
so
far
requested
only
minor
changes
that
she
agreed
to
she
said
she
will
make
further
changes
to
the
final
version
to
mollify
agency
censors
they
know
where
to
find
me
she
said
they
have
had
a
copy
for
over
a
year
and
they
have
never
identified
a
single
sentence
or
section
they
wanted
to
redact
she
said
in
a
telephone
interview
that
she
changed
certain
facts
to
protect
national
security
including
names
places
and
operational
details
but
she
said
any
fictionalization
was
mostly
inconsequential
my
aim
was
really
to
capture
the
kind
of
capital
t
truth
the
emotional
truth
of
going
through
this
transformation
she
said
speaking
of
her
emotional
journey
as
she
came
to
empathize
with
some
of
the
people
the
cia
was
hunting
and
killing
and
that
is
something
you
can
do
and
still
maintain
accuracy
by
not
only
changing
names
and
places
but
by
having
compelling
characters
and
situations
i
met
along
the
way
without
identifying
them
directly
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
fox
said
two
of
the
characters
in
the
book
have
composite
characteristics
to
mask
their
identities
the
fact
that
fox's
book
was
submitted
to
her
publisher
without
the
agency's
approval
was
first
reported
thursday
by
yashar
ali
in
his
newsletter
fox
who
says
she
served
roughly
from
to
says
her
book
is
largely
a
positive
portrayal
of
the
cia
an
ode
to
the
unsung
heroes
of
the
intelligence
world
current
and
former
cia
officials
confirmed
that
fox
worked
for
the
cia
though
all
contacted
by
nbc
news
were
either
unfamiliar
with
or
unwilling
to
discuss
the
details
of
her
career
she
writes
that
she
was
recruited
while
a
graduate
student
at
georgetown
university
after
she
developed
an
algorithm
that
predicted
the
likelihood
that
an
area
would
be
used
as
a
terrorist
safe
haven
she
provided
nbc
news
with
a
copy
of
her
thesis
but
her
thesis
adviser
the
terrorism
expert
dan
byman
told
nbc
news
he
did
not
recall
the
algorithm
but
did
remember
that
fox
was
a
bright
and
capable
student
fox
says
she
was
helped
into
the
agency
by
dallas
jones
who
was
then
the
cia
analyst
in
residence
at
georgetown
a
person
familiar
with
jones's
account
says
he
did
help
her
get
hired
at
the
agency
fox
writes
that
she
spent
a
stint
as
an
analyst
at
cia
headquarters
before
being
recruited
into
what
was
then
known
as
the
national
clandestine
service
the
cia's
operations
arm
the
division
that
spies
overseas
according
to
her
book
she
was
sent
to
the
agency
training
base
in
virginia
known
as
the
farm
where
she
learned
how
to
spot
surveillance
develop
rapport
with
potential
sources
and
shoot
an
m
rifle
she
says
she
was
assigned
to
the
section
of
the
cia's
counterterrorism
center
that
focuses
on
terrorist's
pursuit
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
ctc
wmd
in
agency
parlance
fox
writes
that
she
was
allowed
to
design
her
own
non-official
cover
and
she
picked
the
art
world
because
her
family
had
ties
to
it
she
ultimately
was
sent
to
live
in
shanghai
she
writes
not
to
spy
there
but
to
bolster
her
cover
as
an
art
dealer
and
disassociate
herself
from
washington
she
says
she
lived
with
her
husband
dean
fox
a
cia
case
officer
who
served
in
afghanistan
fox
writes
powerfully
about
the
stresses
of
living
under
cover
including
what
that
life
does
to
relationships
she
married
her
first
husband
a
british
subject
mainly
because
it
was
a
choice
between
marriage
and
breaking
up
that
marriage
was
annulled
and
her
marriage
to
fox
didn't
survive
either
one
thing
that
came
between
them
she
writes
was
her
increasing
conviction
that
the
cia
was
too
quick
to
use
lethal
force
against
terrorists
i
find
that
building
trust
simply
works
better
than
exerting
force
she
writes
detention
simply
works
better
than
assassination
fox
details
the
recruitment
of
a
source
in
the
illicit
arms
dealing
world
a
hungarian
named
jakab
who
sells
nuclear
precursors
to
terror
groups
jakab
ultimately
tells
her
about
a
plan
to
detonate
a
radiation
bomb
in
karachi
pakistan
she
writes
in
the
book's
climatic
scene
she
describes
meeting
in
karachi
with
armed
extremists
affiliated
with
al
qaeda
and
the
taliban
in
an
effort
to
convince
them
to
stop
their
compatriots
from
setting
off
the
bomb
she
portrays
the
meeting
as
a
success
in
part
because
she
offered
a
jihadi
some
clove
oil
to
help
with
his
baby
daughter's
asthma
she
doesn't
mention
any
security
team
or
coordination
with
pakistani
intelligence
four
former
cia
case
officers
raised
questions
about
that
account
saying
the
agency
would
never
have
sent
an
american
case
officer
alone
to
a
meeting
with
dangerous
extremists
in
pakistan
typically
cia
operations
in
pakistan
during
that
period
were
conducted
in
coordination
with
pakistani
intelligence
said
the
officers
including
one
who
played
a
key
role
in
the
same
section
in
which
fox
says
she
worked
if
someone
proposed
an
operation
like
that
to
me
i
would
send
them
back
for
remedial
training
he
said
even
if
the
cia
decided
to
meet
a
source
in
pakistan
without
telling
the
pakistanis
the
former
officers
said
it
would
have
made
no
sense
to
send
a
nonofficial
cover
officer
instead
of
one
operating
under
diplomatic
cover
who
would
have
a
measure
of
legal
protection
if
caught
if
that
and
other
scenes
in
the
book
really
happened
fox
may
be
revealing
sensitive
information
agency
veterans
say
and
if
it
didn't
she
may
be
violating
one
of
the
core
tenets
of
nonfiction
writing
says
samuel
freedman
who
teaches
courses
in
ethics
and
nonfiction
writing
as
a
journalism
professor
at
columbia
university
freedman
said
any
changes
of
fact
in
a
nonfiction
book
raise
questions
if
she
wants
to
write
that
kind
of
a
book
why
not
do
it
as
a
work
of
fiction
he
said
fox
says
her
book
is
true
even
if
every
detail
isn't
the
cia's
right
of
review
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
in
in
the
case
of
former
officer
frank
snepp
whose
book
about
the
agency's
role
in
vietnam
did
not
go
through
agency
censors
the
cia's
prepublication
review
process
has
been
roundly
criticized
as
slow
and
conservative
but
agency
veterans
say
they
recall
only
one
other
time
in
recent
history
when
a
former
operative
totally
bypassed
it
in
a
former
officer
writing
under
the
pseudonym
ishmael
jones
published
a
highly
critical
memoir
without
cia
approval
after
he
said
the
agency
review
board
sought
to
block
almost
all
of
it
the
cia
sued
him
and
won
a
judgment
seizing
all
revenues
the
officer
had
or
would
derive
from
the
book
including
tv
and
movie
rights
one
of
the
reasons
cia
leaders
were
so
concerned
with
jones
account
former
officers
tell
nbc
news
was
that
he
described
operating
under
nonofficial
cover
in
a
lesser-known
case
in
the
cia
went
to
court
once
again
to
seize
book
revenues
from
a
contractor
who
published
without
going
through
the
review
process
in
theory
the
agency
could
file
a
similar
lawsuit
against
fox
though
doing
so
would
call
more
attention
to
her
book
in
a
former
cia
case
officer
who
served
in
afghanistan
published
a
memoir
left
of
boom
that
was
heavily
redacted
by
the
cia
his
description
of
an
operation
to
take
down
a
bomb-making
network
was
rendered
practically
incomprehensible
by
blacked-out
portions
which
he
chose
to
leave
in
the
final
copy
last
year
former
cia
analyst
nada
bakos
sued
the
agency
over
what
she
viewed
as
unreasonable
delays
in
the
approval
of
her
book
the
targeter
my
life
in
the
cia
hunting
terrorists
and
challenging
the
white
house
bakos
told
nbc
news
that
as
frustrated
as
she
was
she
never
considered
publishing
without
cia
approval
she
negotiated
a
mutually
agreeable
set
of
redactions
what
fox
has
done
she
said
is
so
irresponsible
it's
not
up
to
her
to
decide
what
is
classified
and
what
isn't
fox
says
her
book
reveals
no
secrets
there
is
nothing
in
here
that
is
a
surprise
to
anyone
who
follows
this
she
said
i
wrote
this
book
to
share
the
lessons
i
learned
in
the
field
about
peacemaking
and
finding
common
ground
many
think
of
cia
as
adversarial
and
war-mongering
my
experience
was
very
different
at
its
best
it's
an
organization
dedicated
to
the
subtle
and
challenging
art
of
building
trust
and
nurturing
relationships
to
save
lives
and
prevent
attacks
