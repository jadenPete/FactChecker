a

has
sided

the
trump
campaign's
request
to
halt
a
california
law
that's
aimed
at
forcing
the
president
to

lawyers
for
trump
and
republicans
argue
that
it
violates
the
u.s.
constitution
by
adding
an
additional
requirement
to
run
for
president
they
also
said
a
federal
law
requiring
presidents
to
disclose
financial
information
supersedes
state
law
we
are
encouraged
that
the
federal
court
tentatively
concluded
that
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted
trump's
lawyer
jay
sekulow
said
in
a
statement
we
look
forward
to
the
court's
written
order
it
remains
our
position
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
states
are
not
permitted
to
add
additional
requirements
for
candidates
for
president
and
that
the
law
violates
the
constitution
