joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden
during

no
actually
i
didn't
giuliani

into
joe
biden
cuomo
asked
moments
later
of
course
i
did
giuliani
said
democrats
have
launched
an
investigation
into
guiliani
and
trump's
involvement
in
ukraine
and
whether
they
tried
to
press
the
ukrainian
government
into
aiding
trump's
reelection
campaign
by
digging
up
dirt
on
an
opponent
democrats
have
also
been
demanding
more
information
regarding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
a
member
of
the
intelligence
community
that
is
now
the
subject
of
a
weeks-long
standoff
with
the
administration
according
to
the
new
york
times
and
other
outlets
the
complaint
stemmed
from
a
july
phone
call
during
which
trump
is
said
to
have
asked
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
investigate
biden's
son's
ties
to
a
ukrainian
energy
company
on
sunday
trump
confirmed
with
reporters
that
he
invoked
biden
during
the
july
call
but
denied
any
wrongdoing
the
conversation
i
had
was
largely
congratulatory
was
largely
corruption
all
of
the
corruption
taking
place
was
largely
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
to
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine

said
