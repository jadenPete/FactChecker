rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
is
the
latest
high-profile
democrat
to
take
the
unusual
step
of
opposing
a
colleague
s
re-election
by
endorsing
a
progressive
challenger
to
illinois
democratic
rep
dan
lipinski
ocasio-cortez
who
herself
defeated
a
long-serving
democrat
in
a
primary
backed
insurgent
marie
newman
on
tuesday
against
lipinksi
a
moderate
who
has
broken
with
party
orthodoxy
on
abortion
and
other
issues
while
representing
a
democratic-leaning
district
in
chicago
i
am
thrilled
to
receive
the
endorsement
of
congresswoman
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
newman
said
in
a
statement
her
unwavering
dedication
to
fighting
for
social
climate
and
economic
justice
is
a
true
inspiration
ocasio-cortez
joins
some
of
the
country's
most
prominent
progressive
names
in
backing
newman
including
presidential
candidates
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
rep
ro
khanna
d-calif
and
liberal
groups
like
planned
parenthood
emily's
list
moveon
and
indivisible
newman
challenged
lipinski
last
year
and
fell
short
but
quickly
declared
she
would
run
again
in
in
the
re-match
newman
has
garnered
institutional
support
quicker
than
she
did
in
but
lipinski
is
also
better
prepared
for
the
challenge
and
vowed
to
fight
hard
in
a
statement
lipinski
called
newman
an
extreme
candidate
who
is
completely
out
of
step
with
the
voters
and
said
his
constituents
do
not
want
to
be
represented
by
a
fifth
member
of
the
squad
referring
to
the
group
of
four
progressive
women
lawmakers
that
includes
ocasio-cortez
the
democratic
party
and
our
country
cannot
afford
an
obstructionist
tea
party
of
the
left
when
we
need
to
focus
on
winning
this
next
election
and
passing
policies
that
will
truly
help
working
families
and
all
who
are
struggling
in
america
today
lipinski
added
slamming
newman's
support
for
medicare
for
all
and
the
green
new
deal
newman
responded
to
lipinski
on
twitter
saying
he's
the
one
who
is
extreme
and
out
of
step
for
voting
against
the
affordable
care
act
and
parroting
absolutely
false
president
donald
trump
talking
points
attacking
medicare
for
all
ocasio-cortez
also
fired
back
at
lipinski
tweeting
aggressive
statements
like
these
are
so
casually
thrown
from
corporate
candidates
towards
grassroots
ones
yet
they
never
get
branded
as
divisive
despite
their
rhetoric
the
congressman
has
the
backing
of
party
campaign
leaders
in
washington
who
have
threatened
to
blacklist
any
vendors
who
do
work
for
newman's
campaign
high-profile
democratic
primaries
are
becoming
more
common
thanks
in
part
to
the
attention
garnered
by
ocasio-cortez
and
others
although
the
new
york
lawmaker
herself
has
not
been
as
quick
to
support
primary
challenges
as
some
expected
she
would
we
are
so
proud
that
marie
newman
is
the
first
justice
democrat
of
this
cycle
to
receive
an
endorsement
from
congresswoman
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
said
alexandra
rojas
the
executive
director
of
justice
democrats
which
has
supported
many
of
the
anti-establishment
primary
bids
the
momentum
is
growing
in
our
movement
to
make
the
democratic
party
fight
for
solutions
as
big
as
the
problems
we
face
and
create
a
party
of
voters
not
corporate
donors
