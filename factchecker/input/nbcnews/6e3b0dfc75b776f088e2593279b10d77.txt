share
this
off
the
charts
white
house
turnover
is
breaking
records
i
think
we
have
tremendous
stability
trump
told
reporters
last
week
the
top
echelon
of
the
trump
administration
has
become
a
high-speed
revolving
door
with
turnover
in
percent
of
the
positions
a
new
study
has
found
and
percent
of
those
white
house
a-team
jobs
have
turned
over
more
than
once
the
study
by
the
brookings
institution
shows
it's
historic
it's
unprecedented
it's
off
the
charts
the
study's
author
kathryn
dunn
tenpas
told
nbc
news
i've
never
seen
this
kind
of
turnover
before
in
just
months
president
donald
trump's
rate
of
change
has
surpassed
all
of
his
predecessors
who
served
four-year
terms
she
said
the
report
focuses
on
the
top
positions
in
the
executive
office
of
the
president
which
includes
jobs
like
national
security
adviser
chief
of
staff
communications
director
press
secretary
and
director
of
national
intelligence
the
study
found
of
the
positions
have
turned
over
since
trump
took
office
sixteen
of
those
positions
have
turned
over
twice
or
more
the
study
found
the
most
recent
departee
was
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
trump's
third
permanent
pick
for
the
job
who
was
forced
out
earlier
this
month
trump's
first
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
was
pushed
out
for
lying
about
contacts
with
russia
and
is
currently
awaiting
sentencing
for
lying
to
the
fbi
about
those
same
dealings
his
successor
h.r.
mcmaster
was
ousted

make

tenpas
who's
studied
white
house
staffing
since
the
s
attributed
the
high
rate
of
the
change
to
the
president
himself
in
all
of
my
studies
i've
never
seen
a
chief
executive
who
fires
staff
more
frequently
and
more
publicly
than
president
trump
it's
extraordinary
she
said
the
a-team
figures
do
not
include
trump's
cabinet
where
there's
also
been
an
unprecedented
amount
of
tumult
and
turnover
nine
out
of
the
cabinet
positions
that
are
in
the
presidential
line
of
succession
have
turned
over
at
least
once
tenpas
found
that
number
surpasses
the
amount
of
change
during
entire
first
terms
of
presidents
ronald
reagan
bill
clinton
george
w.
bush
and
barack
obama
and
the
one
term
of
george
h.w.
bush
the
elder
bush
is
the
only
president
who
came
close
to
the
amount
of
cabinet
turnover
eight
but
that
was
over
four
years
prior
to
trump
the
trends
in
cabinet
and
a-team
turnover
were
similar
tenpas
said
there's
a
little
turnover
in
the
first
year
a
bigger
uptick
in
year
two
slightly
bigger
in
year
three
and
then
smaller
in
year
four
with
staff
and
cabinet
members
generally
staying
on
during
a
president's
re-election
campaigns
the
problems
at
the
top
are
emblematic
of
a
larger
problem
plaguing
the
trump
administration
a
large
number
of
vacancies
in
high-level
positions
across
the
federal
government
trump
has
not
nominated
people
to
fill
positions
that
require
senate
confirmation
according
to
an
online
tracker
by
the
washington
post
and
the
partnership
for
public
service
a
nonpartisan
nonprofit
that
monitors
presidential
appointments
the
number
of
vacancies
and
employees
temporarily
filling
other
jobs
leads
to
upheaval
and
chaos
and
is
hampering
the
president's
ability
to
get
the
most
out
of
his
agencies
tenpas
said
asked
about
the
churn
during
an
event
at
the
southern
border
last
week
trump
had
a
different
take
i
think
we
have
tremendous
stability
trump
told
reporters
in
california
he
added
that
having
acting
agency
heads
instead
of
ones
confirmed
by
the
senate
gives
him
flexibility
and
an
opportunity
to
see
if
they're
the
right
people
for
the
jobs
i'm
seeing
how
i
like
them
