the

the

the
ways

the

the

are
orphan
programs
that
are
critically
necessary

not

the

an

later
that

the
federal

scaled
up
rural

across
the
country
as
part
of
the

on

it
gave

in

said
larry
anderson

official
who

in

s
it's
not
the
objective
of
the
program
to
have
them
living
in
squalor
the
agency's
inspection
system
though
is
less
rigorous
and
transparent
than
the
one
that
hud
uses
to
evaluate
public
housing
in
suburbs
and
cities
the
usda's
inspection
report
does
not
tally
the
total
number
of
violations
at
a
property
or
provide
numerical
scores
and
no
information
about
inspection
results
is
readily
available

the
public
the

said
it
was
prohibited
from
releasing
more
detailed
data
without
a
freedom
of

act
request
nbc
news
filed
foia
requests
months
ago
but
the
usda
has
yet
to
release
any
documents
in
response
the
usda
intentionally
designed
the
system
to
be
less
codified
than
hud's
to
empower
its
field
staff
and
encourage
a
hands-on
approach
to
supervising
its
loans
said
anderson
who
currently
works
as
a
housing
consultant
for
rural
property
owners
but
years
of
staff
cutbacks
which
accelerated
under
the
obama
administration
have
undermined
the
system
leaving
the
usda
without
enough
experienced
field
staff
members
according
to
some
housing
advocates
and
former
officials
like
anderson
the
usda
also
stopped
using
worksheets
that
indicated
the
frequency
and
severity
of

as
part
of
a
transition
to
a
digital
inspection
system
that
was
completed
in
according

information
provided

a
change
that
makes
the

thorough
and
more
subjective

standards

have
not

a
casual

covered

one
home
was
in
such
poor
shape
that
the
usda
said
in
a
july
letter
to
the
complex's
owner
that
the
tenant
need
ed
to
be
moved
to
a
different
unit
immediately
but
on
the
inspection
report
that
year
given
to
the
housing
authority
the
usda
did
not
mark
any
official
violations
instead
the
agency
simply
provided
the
owner
with
a
bullet-pointed
list
of
findings
which
the
usda
later
acknowledged
weren't
addressed
in
a
letter
to
the
housing
authority
the
following
year
living
conditions
appeared
to
be
deteriorating
according
to
agency
documents
in
general
the
units
are
in
extremely
poor
condition
and
in
need
of
substantial
rehabilitation
the
usda
said
in
august
the
usda
can
take
forceful
action
in
response
to
violations
including
foreclosing
on
the
property
or
issuing
fines
to
avoid
such
measures
which
could
displace
tenants
the
usda
recommends
asking
owners
to
create
a
formal
workout
plan
for
correcting
serious
problems
but
such
a
plan
never
came
together
in

according
to
agency
records
and

with
staff
and

in

usda
staff
visited

times
but
only
spoke
in
general
terms
about

and
minor
upkeep
such
as
cleaning
up
stray
beer
cans
said
alan
sullivan
executive
director
of
the
belle

no
one
demanded
a
comprehensive

to
fix
the
longstanding
problems
he
said
the
usda
held
the
meetings
to
discuss
concerns
with
the
unacceptable
level
of
deferred
maintenance
of
the
property
the
agency
wrote
in
its
letter
to
the
housing
authority
but
says
the
owner
had
not
taken
the
proper
steps
to
submit
an
assessment
of
the
property's
repair
needs
sullivan
contests
this
providing
nbc
news
with
his
correspondence
with
the

the
current
problems
caught
the
attention
of

this

county
a

heard
about

predicament
rats
were
biting
their

roaches
skittered

the

prompted
an
immediate
response
from
sens
rick
scott
r-fla
and
marco
rubio
r-fla
as
well
as
the
usda
which
demanded
a
repair
plan
from
the

in

these
are
some
of
the
poorest
families
in
my
community
who
are
doing
some
of
the
hardest
work
said
melissa
mckinlay
a
palm
beach
county
commissioner
they
don't
deserve
to
live
like
this
the
conditions
were
so
grim
that
mckinlay
enlisted
the
county
health
department
to
assess
the
properties
in
august
the
county's
inspection
reports
describe
damaged
walls
widespread
mold
rodent
droppings
roaches
exposed
wires
missing
smoke
detectors
and
a
sewer
line
discharging
sewage
onto
the
ground
among
other
serious
violations
the
usda
says
that
it
followed
all
standard
policies
and
procedures
in
belle
glade
noting
that
the
government
had
poured
millions
into
the
complex
over
the
years
to
expand
and
rehabilitate
the
buildings
the
property's
owner
has
million
in
reserves
that
it
should
have
spent
on
repairs
long
ago
the
usda
said
faulting
the
housing
authority
for
failing
to
fix
the
problems
promptly
the
belle
glade
housing
authority
submitted
a
written
plan
to
the
usda
in
mid-august
explaining
how
it
was
stepping
up
on
our
care
of
the
property
and
is
now
waiting
for
a
response
but
the
management
also
blames
some
of
the
most
egregious
health
and
safety
violations
on
tenants
themselves
if
they
don't
take
care
of
it
if
they
leave
their
food
sitting
out
they're
unfortunately
going
to
have
problems
whether
it
be
roaches
or
rats
sullivan
said
he
added
that
cultural
differences
have
exacerbated
the
chronic
mold
and
mildew
we
have
a
big
problem
with
the
people
that
are
from
haiti
they
don't
want
to
run
the
air
conditioning
the
struggle
to
fix
the
okeechobee
center
echoes
shortcomings
that
government
watchdogs
have
flagged
as
well
in
a
report
the
government
accountability
office
found
that
percent
of
all
usda
properties
dedicated
to
agricultural
workers
had
violations
related
to
their
physical
condition
finances
or
management
without
a
formal
workout
plan
in
place
to
address
them
or
were
in
default
which
meant
the
owner
was
at
risk
of
losing
them
while
only
a
handful
of
those
properties
were
in
high
levels
of
disrepair
the
usda
routinely
let
problems
languish
and
was
unable
to
identify
or
track
the
most
severe
problems
compel
owners
to
make
fixes
or
direct
funds
toward
high-need
properties
the
watchdog's
report
said
under

threats
to
the
usda's
rural

programs
have
been
mounting
despite
growing
concerns
that

the

usda

anderson
said
advocates
want
the

have
suggested
bringing
in
third-party
inspectors
to
assess
the

instead
of

making
long-term

can
be
costly

and

states

the

has
developed
a

of

estimated
to

finding

like
to
be
there

as
a
charitable

we
can't

foot
the
