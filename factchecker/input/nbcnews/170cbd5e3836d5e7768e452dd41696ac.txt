share
this
impeachment
proceedings
against
trump
seem
more
likely
than
ever
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
after
the
news
over
the
last
hours
it
sure
seems
that
impeachment
proceedings
against
president
trump
are
more
likely
than
ever
before
it's
time
break
out
that
old
ron
paul
gif
because
it's
all
happening
or
it
at
least
looks
that
way
this
morning
by
the
way
of
those
seven
freshmen
democrats
who
wrote
that
wapo
op-ed
all
flipped
seats
previously
held
by
republicans
four
won
by
less
than
percentage
points
and
four
also
currently
hold
seats
won
by
trump
in
the
election
notably
however
all
of
that
recent
impeachment
action
is
on
the
democratic
side
for
republicans
outside
of
the
concerns
by
mitt
romney
pat
toomey
and
maybe
lindsey
graham
it's
been
a
much
different
story
vice
news
elizabeth
landers
asked
sen
ben
sasse
r-neb
if
he
had
concerns
about
the
trump-ukraine-whistleblower
story
you're
welcome
to
talk
to
james
in
my
office
replying
to
an
earlier
question
by
landers
sasse
said
he's
not
doing
interviews
on
the
topic
right
now
since
he
sits
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
another
reporter
yesterday
asked
sen
shelley
moore
capito
r-w
v.
if
a
u.s.
president
should
be
talking
to
foreign
leaders
about
domestic
political
opponents
the
senator's
response
probably
not
huffpost
reporter
arthur
delaney
asked
sen
josh
hawley
r-mo
if
it
was
ok
for
a
president
to
ask
a
foreign
government
to
help
him
win
an
election
is
that
what
he
did
hawley
responded
he
asked
them
for
help
with
an
election
can
you
send
me
that
and
marco
rubio
said
that
trump
shouldn't
have
raised
biden
with
ukraine's
president
he
added
however
but
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
an
impeachable
offense
as
some
people
claim
now
the
second
thing
you
raise
a
quid
pro
quo
he
denies
and
so
do
the
ukrainians
if
alternative
information
emerges
we
have
a
different
set
of
circumstances
but
that's
not
before
us
right
now
several
months
ago
during
the
russia
investigation
we
told
you
that
if
impeachment
did
happen
it
would
freeze
the
democratic
race
in
place
well
guess
what's
going
to
happen
if
house
democrats
go
down
impeachment
road
answer
it's
going
to
remove
the
contest
from
the
main
stage
at
least
for
a
while
outside
of
that
we
only
have
questions
to
pose
bernie
sanders
and
pete
buttigieg
continue
their
tours
through
iowa
mark
sanford
also
is
in
the
hawkeye
state
beto
o'rourke
is
in
ohio
and
bill
weld
and
joe
walsh
participate
in
a
gop
primary
debate
sponsored
by
business
insider
pete
buttigieg
yesterday
campaigned
in
iowa
where
he
endorsed
the
dnc's
new
debate
requirements
nbc's
priscilla
thompson
reports
buttigieg's
remarks
there's
been
a
fair
amount
of
time
now
for
candidates
to
make
our
case
and
to
demonstrate
the
kind
of
strength
that
is
required
we
can
quibble
over
where
we're
going
to
draw
the
line
we
know
they've
got
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
so
there's
a
manageable
number
bernie
sanders
spent
the
day
on
his
bernie
beats
trump
tour
where
hit
president
trump
for
manufacturing
goods
in
other
countries
per
nbc's
gary
grumbach
donald
trump
who
is
telling
corporations
to
hire
american
workers
does
his
clothing
line
in
mexico
donald
trump
who
loves
american
workers
makes
his
furniture
line
in
turkey
sanders
said
so
i
say
to
trump
before
you
tell
corporations
all
over
the
world
to
come
back
to
america
why
don't
you
lead
by
example
percent
that's
the
share
of
all
voters
other
than
democratic
primary
voters
who
say
they
want
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
for
president
to
propose
larger
scale
policies
that
bring
major
change
on
issues
like
health
care
climate
change
and
college
affordability
even
if
they
may
cost
more
and
be
harder
to
pass
a
larger
share
of
all
voters
percent
say
they
prefer
proposals
on
those
issues
that
would
create
less
change
but
be
easier
to
pass
and
percent
say
they
prefer
neither
small
nor
large
scale
policies
on
those
issues
to
bring
about
change
at
all
that's
according
to
our
recent
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
which
also
found
that
a
majority
of
democratic
primary
voters
percent
said
they
prefer
large
scale
change
compared
to
percent
who
prefer
policies
on
a
smaller
scale
don't
miss
the
pod
from
yesterday
when
we
reported
on
trump's
historically
low
personal
likeability
ratings
and
why
they
matter
the
newest
calls
for
impeachment
could
give
nancy
pelosi
cover
to
take
the
next
step
per
nbc's
heidi
pryzbyla
geoff
bennett
and
alex
moe
and
the
new
york
times
on
trump
instead
of
no
collusion
trump
now
seems
to
be
saying
so
what
if
i
did
a
federal
judge
has
ruled
that
the
trump
administration
violated
the
law
by
failing
to
resolve
visa
applications
for
afghans
and
iraqis
who
worked
with
american
troops
and
diplomats
meanwhile
across
the
pond
britain's
highest
court
has
ruled
that
prime
minister
boris
johnson's
suspension
of
parliament
was
illegal
here
are
the
new
dnc
qualification
rules
for
the
november
debate
jonathan
allen
writes
that
the
impeachment
dam
could
break
this
week
a
u.s.

awful
lot
about
the
nobel
prize
politico
looks
at
what
pete
buttigieg
is
up
to
with
his
all-access
bus

house
