democrats
and

advocates
are
weighing
last-minute
challenges
to
the
state's
congressional
voting
maps
after
a
three-judge
panel
rebuked
extreme
partisan
gerrymandering
in
the
state
the
judges
in
a
page
sharply
worded
ruling
tuesday
threw
out
the
state's
legislative
districts
maps
writing
that
gop
lawmakers
partisan
intent
in
drawing
the
maps
the
surgical
precision
with
which
they
were
executed
and
the
distinct
advantage
the
maps
gave
to
republicans
violated
the
state's
constitution
while
the
ruling
does
not
directly
apply
to
the
state's
congressional
district
maps
experts
and
voting
rights
advocates
said
the
implications
are
clear
north
carolina
democratic
party
communications
director
robert
howard
told
nbc
news
on
wednesday
that
the
party
is
considering
a
suit
to
push
for
new
house
voting
maps
ahead
of
the
election
we
do
believe
that
the
precedent
set
by
yesterday's
decision
applies
to
the
congressional
districts
howard
said
we're
evaluating
all
our
options
common
cause
the
watchdog
group
that
filed
the
lawsuit
over
the
state's
legislative
maps
is
also
considering
a
challenge
to
the
congressional
maps
said
dan
vicu
a
the
organization's
national
redistricting
manager
vicu
a
said
it
was
unclear
if
common
cause
would
team
up
with
democrats
north
carolina
a
purple
state
is
currently
represented
by
nine
republicans
and
three
democrats
in
congress
thanks
to
careful
republican-drawn
districts
that
advocates
say
are
heavily
gerrymandered
any
challenge
would
have
to
be
mounted
fast
however
there's
just
six
months
left
before
the
primary
in
the
state
and
candidates
are
already
running
for
congress
based
on
the
old
maps
maps
secured
through
litigation
would
be
short-lived
after
the
census
a
completely
new
set
of
maps
will
be
drawn
in
but
howard
said
democrats
are
eager
for
fairer
maps
even
if
it
means
some
short-term
discomfort
in
the
upcoming
primary
we're
still
kind
of
digesting
the
decision
from
last
nights
he
said
if
we
did
go
down
that
path
it
would
be
within
the
coming
weeks
tuesday's
ruling
was
a
huge
win
for
voting
rights
advocates
who
say
that
gerrymandering
the
process
of
drawing
district
maps
to
favor
a
party
or
politician
undermines
democracy
by
allowing
lawmakers
to
pick
the
voters
though
the
supreme
court
declined
to
weigh
in
on
partisan
gerrymandering
in
north
carolina's
congressional
districts
earlier
this
summer
saying
federal
courts
shouldn't
police
the
issue
the
state
court's
smackdown
has
revived
advocates
hopes
of
a
remedy
there's
no
reason
why
these
clauses
wouldn't
apply
with
legal
force
for
the
drawing
of
congressional
districts
michael
li
senior
counsel
at
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
new
york
university
told
nbc
news
the
state
court
found
that
the
republican-drawn
legislative
maps
violated
the
state's
constitutional
protections
of
free
elections
free
speech
and
assembly
and
equal
protection
under
the
law
it
doesn't
make
sense
logically
for
those
to
be
limited
to
legislative
districts
li
added
so
far
republican
lawmakers
have
not
made
public
plans
to
appeal
tuesday's
ruling
while
the
court
said
it
reserved
the
right
to
move
the
primary
if
needed
to
accommodate
the
new
state
legislative
districts
moving
primaries
is
disruptive
and
any
new
legal
challenge
would
have
to
weigh
that
it's
later
in
the
cycle
than
we
would
have
liked
to
start
litigation
since
we
initially
challenged
in
federal
court
vicu
a
said
adding
that
common
cause
would
make
a
decision
in
weeks
tops
elisabeth
theodore
one
of
the
lead
attorneys
in
the
common
cause
suit
said
past
legal
challenges
to
north
carolina's
congressional
districts
would
aid
a
future
suit
there's
been
a
lot
of
work
done
to
show
that
the
congressional
maps
in
north
carolina
were
partisan
gerrymanders
she
told
nbc
news
so
anybody
bringing
that
challenge
would
have
a
lots
of
facts
already
established
ready
to
rely
on
li
said
that
the
evidence
of
partisan
gerrymandering
in
the
state's
congressional
districts
is
starker
than
it
was
in
the
case
of
the
state
legislative
districts
that
were
thrown
out
on
tuesday
they
were
really
brazen
li
said
pointing
to
a
remark
from
a
republican
lawmaker
on
the
aims
of
the
congressional
maps
i
propose
that
we
draw
the
maps
to
give
a
partisan
advantage
to
republicans
and
three
democrats
because
i
do
not
believe
it's
possible
to
draw
a
map
with
republicans
and
two
democrats
state
rep
david
lewis
senior
chairman
of
the
north
carolina's
house
of
representatives
redistricting
committee
was
quoted
as
saying
in
a
transcript
of
a
committee
meeting
when
the
legislature
was
forced
by
courts
to
rework
the
maps
for
a
second
time
in
they
weren't
trying
to
hide
it
they
were
almost
bragging
about
it
li
said
advocates
say
the
north
carolina
ruling
a
stinging
condemnation
of
partisan
gerrymandering
also
offers
a
model
for
other
state's
gerrymandering
lawsuits
at
this
point
there
are
two
state
level
decisions
finding
that
partisan
gerrymandering
violates
state
constitutions
there's
the
pennsylvania
decision
and
this
decision
they
really
provide
a
roadmap
for
further
state
level
challenges
at
the
legislative
level
and
the
congressional
challenge
said
theodore
according
to
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
some
states
have
fair
election
clauses
in
their
state
constitutions
that
could
be
targeted
in
gerrymandering
legislation
in
the
future
but
theodore
said
the
court's
ruling
that
partisan
gerrymandering
violated
free
speech
and
equal
protections
clauses
is
particularly
significant
those
are
provisions
that
every
state
in
the
country
has
in
their
constitution
theodore
told
nbc
news
the
north
carolina
court
analysis
really
provides
a
road
map
for
success
in
other
states
vicu
a
said
common
cause
is
already
looking
toward
identifying
where
partisan
gerrymandering
may
take
place
and
where
state
constitutions
might
give
them
an
opening
to
challenge
it
it's
going
to
be
an
exciting
time
for
voter
empowerment
after
the
next
lines
are
drawn
vicu
a
said
we
have
a
good
handle
on
where
there's
going
to
be
single-party
control
where
the
state
constitution
has
been
interpreted
in
a
pro-voter
matter
where
we
can
ask
the
court
to
change
precedent
where
that's
the
case
