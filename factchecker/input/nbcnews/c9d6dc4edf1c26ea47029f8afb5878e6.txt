share
this
pentagon
is
last
holdout
as
stephen
miller
tries
to
slash
number
of
refugees
allowed
in
u.s.
the
pentagon
is
the
lone
voice
inside
the
trump
admin
defending
the
u.s.
refugee
program
washington
the
pentagon
is
fighting
against
proposals
by
white
house
officials
to
drastically
cut
the
number
of
refugees
allowed
into
the
u.s.
and
has
called
for
reserving
visas
for
iraqis
who
risked
their
lives
working
for
u.s.
troops
according
to
five
people
familiar
with
the
plan
in
internal
discussions
the
defense
department
has
expressed
opposition
to
any
further
reductions
to
the
current
annual
ceiling
of
for
refugee
admissions
which
already
is
at
a
historic
low
for
the
year-old
u.s.
refugee
program
the
sources
told
nbc
news
defense
officials
also
proposed
setting
aside
about
slots
specifically
for
iraqi
applicants
who
worked
for
u.s.
troops
as
interpreters
or
in
other
jobs
according
to
one
current
u.s.
official
one
former
u.s.
official
and
three
refugee
advocates
briefed
on
the
deliberations
the
pentagon
has
emerged
as
the
lone
voice
in
internal
debates
defending
the
traditional
role
of
a
refugee
program
overseen
by
the
state
department
an
unusual
twist
that
reflects
the
administration's
aggressive
stance
on
immigration
and
refugees
the
pentagon's
stance
is
at
odds
with
white
house
senior
adviser
stephen
miller
the
architect
of
the
president's
sweeping
crackdown
on
immigration
and
his
allies
at
the
state
department
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
who
are
all
proposing
deep
cuts
or
even
a
halt
to
refugee
admissions
for
the
next
fiscal
year
starting
in
october
the
white
house
however
is
weighing
one
option
that
would
reduce
overall
refugee
admissions
possibly
lowering
the
cap
to
or
lower
while
setting
aside
a
certain
number
of
openings
for
iraqi
applicants
similar
to
what
the
pentagon
has
proposed
the
sources
said
defense
officials
are
making
the
case
that
accepting
refugees
is
in
the
country's
national
security
interest
arguing
that
it
provides
a
way
to
support
allies
who
are
inundated
with
refugees
fleeing
conflict
and
to
promote
stability
in
volatile
areas
the
pentagon
declined
to
discuss
its
position
in
the
administration's
deliberations
current
ongoing
discussions
for
this
year's
refugee
ceiling
are
pre-decisional
and
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
comment
at
this
time
said
pentagon
spokesperson
lt
col
carla
gleason
gleason
added
that
the
department
recognized
iraqis
and
afghans
who
had
worked
for
the
u.s.
government
had
put
their
lives
at
risk
and
deserved
to
be
taken
into
account
for
that
reason
leadership
of
the
department
of
defense
and
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
want
to
ensure
that
we
fulfill
our
commitments
to
those
who
have
provided
support
to
our
diplomatic
and
military
efforts
abroad
to
protect
the
homeland
and
support
key
aspects
of
the
president's
national
security
strategy
she
said
it
remained
unclear
how
hard
the
new
defense
secretary
mark
esper
and
his
deputies
were
ready
to
push
in
the
interagency
debate
one
republican
congressional
aide
said
it's
time
to
step
forward
in
the
fight
in
the
interagency
and
to
speak
out
the
aide
said
i
haven't
seen
that
leadership
yet
from
the
department
since
president
donald
trump
entered
office
the
number
of
former
iraqi
interpreters
allowed
into
the
u.s.
has
slowed
to
a
trickle
with
only
two
obtaining
visas
last
year
nbc
news
previously
reported
military
veterans
and
lawmakers
have
voiced
outrage
over
the
issue
saying
the
administration
is
turning
its
back
on
iraqis
who
now
face
threats
over
their
association
with
americans
a
special
visa
program
designed
to
help
iraqis
who
worked
with
u.s.
forces
resettle
in
the
united
states
expired
in
since
then
iraqis
have
been
treated
like
other
refugee
applicants
but
can
apply
directly
to
the
united
states
instead
of
having
to
register
with
the
united
nations
former
defense
secretary
james
mattis
last
year
unsuccessfully
argued
against
scaling
back
refugee
admissions
citing
the
service
of
iraqis
and
the
need
to
support
allies
abroad
in
a
september
memo
mattis
said
washington
owed
a
debt
to
iraqis
who
have
risked
their
own
lives
and
their
families
lives
by
aligning
with
our
diplomats
and
warfighters
providing
essential
mission
support
in
an
open
letter
to
the
white
house
this
month
retired
generals
and
admirals
called
on
president
trump
to
raise
the
ceiling
for
refugee
admissions
in
line
with
previous
administrations
to
support
what
they
called
critical
national
security
interests
when
america
turns
its
back
on
refugees
we
are
challenged
to
call
on
our
allies
to
accept
them
ultimately
risking
premature
returns
like
those
of
syrians
back
to
an
unstable
syria
somalis
back
to
an
unstable
somalia
and
afghans
back
to
an
unstable
afghanistan
the
officers
wrote
in
a
break
with
both
republican
and
democratic
presidents
trump
has
slashed
the
annual
ceiling
on
refugees
since
entering
the
white
house
at
the
end
of
the
obama
administration
the
cap
was
at
trump
cut
it
to
for
the
fiscal
year
and
then
to
for
the
current
fiscal
year
both
caps
represented
record
lows
since
the
introduction
of
the
refugee
act
the
average
level
for
refugee
admissions
has
hovered
around
over
four
decades
the
refugee
program
traditionally
falls
under
the
authority
of
the
state
department
and
in
previous
administrations
discussions
about
refugee
ceilings
were
overseen
by
the
national
security
council
but
under
the
trump
administration
miller
and
white
house
officials
have
treated
it
as
a
domestic
issue
as
part
of
a
wider
policy
designed
to
limit
both
legal
and
illegal
immigration
administration
officials
have
defended
cuts
to
refugee
admissions
citing
the
need
to
vet
applicants
for
any
possible
terrorist
links
as
well
as
the
need
to
focus
administrative
manpower
on
handling
an
increase
in
asylum
cases
asked
about
the
internal
debate
over
refugee
admissions
a
state
department
spokesperson
said
we
do
not
discuss
internal
and
interagency
deliberations
or
communications
involved
in
those
deliberations
but
the
spokesperson
added
we
will
continue
to
resettle
the
most
vulnerable
refugees
including
those
who
have
fled
religious
persecution
while
prioritizing
the
safety
and
security
of
the
american
people
the
dhs
and
white
house
declined
to
comment
for
decades
the
united
states
led
the
world
in
refugee
admissions
but
that
is
no
longer
the
case
since
trump
entered
office
the
dramatic
drop
in
u.s.
admissions
coincides
with
a
global
refugee
crisis
with
million
people
fleeing
war
famine
and
persecution
the
most
since
world
war
ii
the
trump
administration
has
come
under
criticism
over
its
refugee
policy
not
only
from
retired
military
officers
but
from
evangelical
leaders
and
organizations
a
constituency
that
otherwise
has
steadfastly
supported
the
president
evangelical
activist
tony
perkins
president
of
the
conservative
family
research
council
and
a
strong
supporter
of
president
trump
said
earlier
this
month
he
was
alarmed
that
the
administration
was
considering
more
dramatic
reductions
in
refugee
admissions
we
strongly
urge
the
administration
to
extend
its
admirable
commitment
to
advancing
religious
freedom
to
its
refugee
resettlement
policy
perkins
said
in
a
statement
on
sept
as
chairman
of
the
u.s.
commission
on
international
religious
freedom
a
bipartisan
body
mandated
by
congress
to
track
religious
freedom
abroad
in
a
letter
in
july
nine
evangelical
leaders
appealed
to
the
administration
to
back
up
its
frequent
public
statements
on
religious
freedom
and
helping
persecuted
christians
abroad
by
raising
the
cap
on
refugee
admissions
the
drastic
decline
in
the
number
of
refugees
we
are
resettling
in
the
u.s.
is
really
troubling
and
it
goes
against
everything
that
we
believe
about
what
our
faith
teaches
us
said
jenny
yang
vice
president
for
advocacy
and
policy
at
world
relief
an
evangelical
organization
that
helps
resettle
refugees
in
the
united
states
it's
extremely
concerning
that
the
administration
is
not
heeding
the
views
of
a
lot
of
evangelicals
