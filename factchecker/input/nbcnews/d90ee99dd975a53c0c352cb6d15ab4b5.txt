pressure
on

says
the
whistleblower
needs
to
come

washington
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
on
sunday
called
on
an
anonymous
whistleblower
from
the
intelligence
community
to
come
forward
as
congressional
democrats
investigate
whether
president
donald
trump
improperly
pressured
the
president
of
ukraine
to
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
for
political
purposes
i
think
if
an
american
president
is
asking
another
foreign
leader
to
interfere
in
an
american
election
murphy
said
in
an
interview
on
meet
the
press
then
there
has
to
be
consequences
for
that
this
whole
timeline
is
hard
to
figure
out
and
there
may
be
someone
who
can
tell
us
more
about
all
of
it
and
that
whistleblower
individual
has
to
come
before
congress
the
call
comes
after
reports
that
a
u.s.
intelligence
officer
had
filed
a
whistleblower
complaint
related
to
a
promise
made
by
trump
to
a
foreign
leader
on
a
phone
call
little
is
known
about
the
content
of
the
complaint
the
washington
post
has
reported
that
the
phone
discussion
involved
ukraine
the
justice
department's
office
of
legal
counsel
advised
the
dni
whether
to
disclose
the
complaint
said
an
official
who
would
not
say
if
attorney
general
william
barr
was
involved
as
congressional
democrats
spar
with
the
white
house
over
the
release
of
the
complaint
much
of
their
concern
has
centered
whether
there's
a
connection
between
an
administration
decision
to
temporarily
freeze
military
aid
to
ukraine
and
the
push
by
trump's
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
to
promote
an
investigation
into
a
ukrainian
energy
company
with
ties
to
biden's
son
hunter
murphy
told
meet
the
press
that
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
raised
concerns
about
the
aid
during
a
meeting
earlier
this
month
and
that
the
ukrainian
president
later
spoke
with
the
delegation
about
what
murphy
referred
to
as
overtures
from
the
trump
administration
he
added
that
zelensky
gave
me
a
very
strong
answer
he
said
they
had
no
intention
to
get
involved
in
an
american
election
trump
and
his
allies
have
denied
any
wrongdoing
also
appearing
on
meet
the
press
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
that
while
he
wasn't
on
the
call
in
question
there
was
no
connection
between
the
aid
and
questions
about
biden
and
trump
dismissed
the
reports
during
friday
comments
in
the
oval
office
where
he
called
for
more
scrutiny
into
biden
it's
ridiculous
it's
a
partisan
whistleblower
they
shouldn't
even
have
information
he
said
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
discussed
but
i
will
say
this
somebody
ought
to
look
into
joe
biden's
statement
because
it
was
disgraceful
where
he
talked
about
billions
of
dollars
that
he's
not
giving
to
a
certain
country
unless
certain
prosecutors
are
taken
off
the
case
the
biden
campaign
has
denied
any
impropriety
by
the
former
vice
president
in
a
memo
released
this
weekend
the
campaign
pointed
to
fact-checkers
and
a
report
from
a
ukrainian
outlet
that
all
say
biden
had
been
fairly
expressing
the
american
government's
position
when
he
pressured
a
prosecutor
to
resign
and
the
former
vice
president
addressed
the
controversy
in
iowa
this
weekend
accusing
trump
of
ginning
up
controversy
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
is
using
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
smear
me
as
democrats
continue
to
call
for
an
investigation
sen
pat
toomey
r-pa
preached
caution
on
meet
the
press
it
is
not
appropriate
for
any
candidate
for
federal
office
certainly
including
a
sitting
president
to
ask
for
assistance
from
a
foreign
country
that's
not
appropriate
but
i
don't
know
that
that's
what
happened
here
he
said
there
might
be
a
reasonable
explanation
for
this
and
there
might
be
a
troublesome
one
and
we
should
understand
why
that
happened
he
added
when
asked
about
the
delay
of
the
foreign
aid
