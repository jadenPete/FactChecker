to

lasted
for
minutes
president
donald
trump
in
a
midsummer
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
asked
him
to
look
into
why
that
country's
top
prosecutor
apparently
had
ended
an
investigation
of
the
business
dealings
of
joe
biden's
son
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
then-vice
president
joe
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
prosecution
so
if
you
can
look
into
it
it
sounds
horrible
to
me
trump
told
zelenskiy
during
the
minute
july
phone
call
a
description
of
the
call
was
made
public
wednesday
by
the
trump
administration
under
pressure
from
democrats
who
have
launched
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
president
sought
the
help
of
a
foreign
leader
to
boost
his
campaign
the
white
house
noted
that
the
summary
of
the
call
was
not
a
verbatim
transcript
and
that
it
represented
a
record
of
the
notes
and
recollections
of
situation
room
duty
officers
and
national
security
council
policy

the
president's
phone
call
made
from
the
white
house
residence
to
zelenskiy
began
with
trump
congratulating
zelenskiy
on
his
election
victory
later
trump
veers
into
the
biden
issue
i
heard
you
had
a
prosecutor
who
was
very
good
and
he
was
shut
down
and
that's
really
unfair
trump
says
on
the
call
according
to
the
description
trump
then
says
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
that
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
he
then
asked
zelenskiy
to
look
into
it
zelenskiy
replies
that
he's
appointing
a
new
prosecutor
who
will
look
into
the
situation
that
is
the
only
mention
about
biden
in
the
memo
about
the
call
the
call
description
is
five
pages
long
trump
said
in
the
call
that
he
wanted
rudy
giuliani
his
personal
lawyer
and
attorney
general
william
barr
to
talk
to
zelenskiy
zelenskiy
replies
by
saying
he
has
the
ability
to
make
sure
that
the
next
prosecutor
will
be
percent
my
person
and
that
he
or
she
will
look
into
the
situation
zelenskiy
also
asks
trump
to
provide
any
additional
information
it
would
be
very
helpful
for
the
investigation
he
said
the
department
of
justice
said
barr
found
out
about
the
call
several
weeks
after
it
was
made
the
matter
was
then
referred
to
the
doj
the
doj
said
trump
has
not
spoken
with
barr
about
having
ukraine
investigate
anything
relating
to
biden
or
his
son
and
the
department
said
the
president
has
not
asked
barr
to
contact
ukraine
on
this
or
any
other
matter
nor
has
barr
has
communicated
with
ukraine
about
this
or
any
other
subject
or
has
he
discussed
this
matter
or
anything
related
to
ukraine
with
giuliani
though
it
was
not
explicit
trump
also
appears
to
tie
the
award
of
aid
to
ukraine
to
zelenskiy's
willingness
to
cooperating
with
trump
i
will
say
that
we
do
a
lot
for
ukraine
we
spend
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
time
much
more
than
the
european
countries
are
doing
trump
says
in
the
description
he
adds
that
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
reciprocal
necessarily
because
things
are
happening
that
are
not
good
but
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
at
another
point
in
the
call
trump
appears
to
ask
zelenskiy
whether
someone
in
the
ukraine
might
possess
a
server
that
contained
some
of
former
presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton's
emails
i
would
like
you
to
do
us
a
favor
though
because
our
country
has
been
through
a
lot
and
ukraine
knows
a
lot
about
it
i
would
like
you
to
find
out
what
happened
with
this
whole
situation
with
ukraine
they
say
crowdstrike
i
guess
you
have
one
of
your
wealthy
people
the
server
they
say
ukraine
has
it
trump
said
on
the
call
according
to
the
transcript
trump
goes
on
to
say
he
would
like
to
have
barr
call
you
or
your
people
and
i
would
like
you
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
he
added
whatever
you
can
do
it's
very
important
that
you
do
it
if
that's
possible
though
it
wasn't
exactly
clear
what
trump
was
referring
to
crowdstrike
is
the
name
of
the
cybersecurity
firm
that
was
hired
to
investigate
the
hack
of
the
democratic
national
committee
in
doj
officials
were
not
able
to
shed
any
light
on
the
matter
crowdstrike
in
a
statement
said
that
it
had
already
provided
all
forensic
evidence
and
analysis
to
the
fbi
regarding
its
dnc
hack
investigation
we
stand
by
our
findings
and
conclusions
that
have
been
fully
supported
by
the
us
intelligence
community
the
company
added
in
the
same
exchange
trump
takes
a
shot
at
now-former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
who
had
testified
before
two
house
committees
the
day
before
the
call
on
july
as
you
saw
yesterday
that
whole
nonsense
ended
with
a
very
poor
performance
by
a
man
named
robert
mueller
an
incompetent
performance
trump
says
according
to
the
memo
at
another
point
in
the
call
zelenskiy
says
he
stayed
in
trump
tower
near
central
park
the
last
time
he
traveled
to
the
u.s.
trump
speaking
at
the
united
nations
wednesday
told
reporters
that
he
applied
no
pressure
whatsoever
in
his
phone
call
with
ukraine's
president
he
said
it
was
friendly
and
that
the
media
built
it
up
to
be
the
call
from
hell
and
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
democrats
however
widely
expressed
outrage
over
the
transcript's
contents
biden
said
it
was
a
tragedy
for
this
country
that
trump
put
personal
politics
above
his
sacred
oath
and
accused
the
president
of
having
put
his
own
political
interests
over
our
national
security
interest
which
is
bolstering
ukraine
against
russian
pressure
congress
must
pursue
the
facts
and
quickly
take
prompt
action
to
hold
donald
trump
accountable
in
the
meantime
i
will
continue
to
focus
my
campaign
not
on
how
donald
trump
abused
his
power
to
come
after
my
family
but
on
how
he
has
turned
his
back
on
america's
families
biden
said
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
who
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
tuesday
against
trump
criticized
the
president
wednesday
for
asking
a
foreign
government
to
help
him
in
his
political
campaign
at
the
expense
of
our
national
security
house
intelligence
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
said
the
transcript
reads
like
a
classic
mob
shakedown
biden's
fellow
contender
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
said
the
notes
represented
a
smoking
gun
the
late
july
discussion
between
trump
and
zelenskiy
emerged
as
a
flash
point
following
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
media
reports
said
was
tied
to
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
nbc
news
has
not
confirmed
that
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
the
whistleblower
issue
an
intelligence
community
employee
heard
about
the
call
from
white
house
officials
according
to
the
employee's
complaint
to
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
and
suggested
it
could
be
a
violation
of
campaign
finance
law
as
soliciting
a
foreign
campaign
contribution
doj's
office
of
legal
counsel
concluded
that
the
complaint
did
not
meet
the
standard
for
passing
the
complaint
on
to
congress
because
it
concerned
neither
an
intelligence
activity
or
intelligence
employee's
conduct
but
doj
said
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
was
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
justice
department's
criminal
division
according
to
doj
officials
the
criminal
division
including
career
employees
concluded
that
there
was
no
campaign
finance
violation
a
doj
official
said
the
criminal
division
concluded
last
week
that
what
trump
was
asking
for
did
not
amount
to
a
thing
of
value
as
the
law
requires
in
conducting
its
analysis
doj
asked
the
white
house
for
the
notes
of
the
president's
conversation
the
so-called
transcript
and
the
white
house
voluntarily
turned
it
over
doj
officials
say
they
do
not
know
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
