share
this
extreme
weather
events
and
the
costs
are
piling
up
when
you
tally
it
all
up
the
costs
are
likely
to
end
up
at
three
quarters
of
a
trillion
dollars
or
more
and
that's
just
for
this
decade
washington
two
weeks
ago
it
was
hurricane
dorian
this
week
tropical
storm
humberto
is
working
its
way
through
the
atlantic
toward
florida
and
there
are
several
other
systems
behind
it
if
it
feels
like
big
weather
events
are
becoming
more
common
in
the
last
few
decades
it's
because
they
are
and
it's
not
just
hurricanes
since
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
data
show
extreme
weather
events
are
starting
to
pile
up
with
big
impacts
on
people
and
property
and
as
the
climate
debate
rages
on
in
washington
those
are
the
kind
of
impacts
that
seem
likely
to
catch
the
attention
of
politicians
start
by
looking
at
the
topic
on
everyone's
minds
this
time
of
year
hurricanes
and
tropical
storms
since
the
s
the
number
of
tropical
depressions
getting
big
enough
to
acquire
a
name
has
been
growing
pretty
steadily
systems
receive
names
when
they
become
strong
enough
to
be
tropical
storms
there
were
named
storms
in
the
atlantic
in
the
s
there
were
named
storms
in
the
atlantic
in
the
s
and
a
whopping
in
the
first
decade
of
this
century
the
tally
sits
at
for
the
current
decade
and
we
are
still
at
the
peak
of
the
season
the
number
of
major
hurricanes
above
category
is
also
up
since
though
down
a
bit
from
the
last
decade
so
far
but
the
growth
of
extreme
weather
extends
beyond
hurricanes
an
analysis
of
weather
disasters
that
did
more
than
billion
in
damage
from
the
national
centers
for
environmental
information
finds
that
such
high-cost
events
are
up
markedly
since
the
s
the
dollar
figures
for
the
events
were
adjusted
for
inflation
there
have
been
such
events
since
and
almost
half
them
have
occurred
in
the
current
decade
and
the
figure
does
not
include
any
events
after
may
so
dorian
is
not
on
the
list
yet
there
were
only
billion-dollar
weather
events
in
the
s
there
is
a
wide
range
of
events
in
that
extreme
weather
calculation
besides
hurricanes
it
includes
floods
droughts
freezes
severe
storms
wildfires
and
winter
storms
and
there
are
some
trends
in
the
data
for
instance
there
were
seven
freeze
winter
storm
events
on
the
list
in
the
s
but
only
six
so
far
in
the
current
decade
but
there
were
only
seven
severe
storms
on
the
s
list
and
in
the
current
decade
but
the
most
consequential
trend
in
the
eyes
of
washington
might
be
the
costs
associated
with
these
events
the
high-impact
weather
events
in
the
s
cost
a
total
of
about
billion
in
inflation-adjusted
dollars
but
the
current
set
of
storms
this
decade
has
cost
a
total
of
more
than
billion
dollars
again
that
does
not
include
the
costs
of
dorian
and
of
two
other
events
on
the
list
the
march
floods
in
the
midwest
and
may
floods
of
the
southern
plains
when
you
tally
it
all
up
the
costs
are
likely
to
end
up
at
three-quarters
of
a
trillion
dollars
or
more
and
that's
just
for
this
decade
at
this
pace
the
number
seems
all
but
certain
to
climb
over
the
trillion-dollar
mark
in
the
s
and
then
there
are
the
human
costs
the
number
of
fatalities
from
these
extreme
weather
events
has
largely
been
climbing
from
in
the
s
to
almost
this
decade
again
before
dorian's
damage
is
added
in
there
could
be
forces
at
play
under
those
data
more
expensive
homes
and
buildings
being
hit
leading
to
higher
costs
in
some
places
poor
construction
leading
to
more
deaths
in
others
maybe
communities
are
building
too
much
in
places
that
are
too
prone
to
dangerous
weather
events
but
the
reasons
are
largely
moot
the
numbers
show
much
more
in
the
way
of
financial
damage
and
lives
lost
this
decade
than
in
the
past
those
are
the
kind
of
numbers
that
upset
constituents
and
those
concerns
tend
to
make
their
way
up
to
lawmakers
and
ultimately
spur
action
you
may
not
want
to
talk
about
global
environmental
changes
but
if
you
represent
florida
or
texas
or
north
carolina
voters
are
going
to
want
to
talk
to
you
about
increasing
hurricane
risk
and
damage
if
you
represent
iowa
or
nebraska
or
kansas
you
can
bet
your
constituents
are
going
to
have
floods
and
droughts
on
their
minds
if
serve
the
good
people
of
california
or
montana
or
colorado
chances
are
you
are
going
to
hear
about
wildfire
risks
climate
change
is
the
kind
of
large-scale
topic
washington
likes
to
talk
to
death
but
growing
real-world
dollars-and-cents
impact
of
severe
weather
events
is
harder
to
ignore
and
the
evidence
for
it
is
mounting
