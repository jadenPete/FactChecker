at

page
but
during
his
confirmation
hearings
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
january
barr
was
not
questioned
about
the
blurb
which
suggested
men
are
often
railroaded
by
a
politically
correct
campus
mob
in
the
blurb
barr
praises
the
book
for
examining
multiple
cases
where
as
he
described
male
students
are
sacrificed
to
the
mob
with
academic
leaders
happily
serving
as
the
hangmen
barr's
professed
skepticism
about
some
campus
sexual
assault
claims
surfaced
after
trump's
call
this
week
for
the
justice
department
to
rescue
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
after
the
new
york
times
published
an
excerpt
of
a
new
book
detailing
asexual
assault
allegation
against
kavanaugh
while
a
student
at
yale
that
he
had
previously
denied
the
book
also
includes
information
about
a
new
allegation
several
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
have
called
for
further
investigation
or
for
the
impeachment
of
kavanaugh
in
light
of
the
allegations
barr's
endorsement
of
the
book
includes
a
broadside
on
the
obama
administration's
approach
to
the
issue
of
campus
sexual
assault
during
obama's
presidency
colleges
and
universities
were
directed
to
aggressively
pursue
sexual
misconduct
allegations
under
title
ix
the
federal
civil
rights
law
that
bans
sex
discrimination
in
education
in
the
trump
administration
ordered
those
obama-era
protections
to
be
reversed
president
obama's
education
department
promulgating
regulations
beyond
its
statutory
authority
invoking
erroneous
data
and
fanning
the
false
narrative
of
a
rape
culture
on
college
campuses
has
created
a
regime
of
kangaroo
justice
barr
wrote
in
the
blurb
kerri
kupec
a
spokeswoman
for
barr
at
the
justice
department
declined
comment
the
book
by
johnson
and
taylor
and
barr's
endorsement
of
it
were
part
of
the
administrative
record
education
secretary
betsy
devos
relied
on
to
make
her
decision
to
roll
back
the
obama-era
rules
according
to
records
ordered
released
by
a
judge
in
response
to
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
rollback
devos
not
barr
has
led
the
trump
administration's
effort
to
change
campus
sexual
assault
policy
taylor
told
nbc
news
that
now
that
barr
is
attorney
general
i
am
hopeful
he
will
help
move
policy
in
the
direction
betsy
devos
is
trying
to
do
while
acknowledging
that
many
of
devos's
proposals
could
easily
be
undone
by
a
future
administration
the
changes
include
requiring
schools
to
disclose
the
identity
of
accusers
to
alleged
assailants
and
allowing
the
accused
to
question
alleged
victims
during
campus
investigations
in
light
of
trump's
recent
tweet
about
the
justice
department
and
kavanaugh
it's
unclear
barr
has
the
power
to
do
anything
to
rescue
kavanaugh
or
any
male
student
accused
of
sexual
misconduct
most
sexual
offenses
are
prosecuted
locally
not
by
the
justice
department
which
handles
sex
trafficking
and
child
exploitation
cases
in
an
interview
taylor
said
barr
had
agreed
to
write
a
blurb
for
his
book
at
a
time
when
neither
expected
barr
would
serve
in
the
justice
department
again
barr
was
attorney
general
under
president
george
h.w.
bush
from
to
barr's
blurb
has
also
raised
concerns
among
some
democrats
on
the
senate
judiciary
committee
who
said
it
should
have
been
raised
during
his
confirmation
hearings
last
january
a
spokesman
for
judiciary
democrats
said
they
had
not
been
aware
of
the
blurb
at
the
time
sen
richard
blumenthal
d-conn
a
member
of
the
committee
is
among
those
who
say
they
would
have
wanted
to
question
barr
about
the
statement
due
process
is
always
important
blumenthal
told
nbc
news
but
barr's
comments
are
way
over
the
top
emily
martin
vice
president
for
education
and
workplace
justice
at
the
national
women's
law
center
said
barr's
comments
are
incredibly
disturbing
coming
from
someone
who
is
now
the
nation's
chief
law
enforcement
officer
his
statement
really
discounts
the
experiences
of
survivors
and
the
challenges
they
face
martin
said
she
went
on
to
raise
concerns
that
barr's
comments
would
mean
his
justice
department
would
leave
schools
less
safe
especially
for
women
and
girls
sens
sheldon
whitehouse
d-r
i.
and
mazie
hirono
d-hawaii
also
members
of
the
committee
agreed
that
barr
should
have
been
pressed
on
the
matter
during
his
confirmation
this
statement
seems
very
out
of
step
with
the
improvements
that
have
been
made
in
recent
decades
around
how
victims
of
rape
are
taken
seriously
said
whitehouse
trump
and
a
number
of
administration
officials
have
come
under
scrutiny
for
expressing
skepticism
about
whether
females
alleging
sexual
assault
should
be
believed
in
july
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
education
candace
jackson
told
the
new
york
times
that
percent
of
accusations
fall
into
the
category
of
we
were
both
drunk
we
broke
up
and
six
months
later
i
found
myself
under
a
title
ix
investigation
she
later
apologized
for
the
comments
earlier
devos
delivered
a
policy
address
in
which
she
said
if
everything
is
harassment
then
nothing
is
at
least
women
have
accused
trump
of
inappropriate
behavior
including
allegations
of
sexual
harassment
or
assault
trump
has
strongly
denied
the
accusations
multiple
times
taylor
the
book's
author
said
he
doesn't
believe
barr's
endorsement
of
his
book
has
any
bearing
on
how
he
would
pursue
prosecution
of
sex
crimes
as
attorney
general
taylor
said
that
he
and
his
co-author
are
strong
critics
of
trump
adding
i'm
quite
willing
to
believe
a
lot
of
the
accusations
against
him
are
true
