washington
the
trump
administration
is
weighing
a
range
of
options
for
a
retaliatory
action
against
iran
including
a
cyberattack
or
physical
strike
on
iranian
oil
facilities
or
revolutionary
guard
assets
u.s.
officials
and
others
briefed
on
the
deliberations
told
nbc
news
in
a
national
security
meeting
on
monday
u.s.
military
leaders
provided
president
donald
trump
with
a
menu
of
possible
actions
against
iran
but
the
president
seeking
a
narrowly
focused
response
that
wouldn't
draw
the
u.s.
into
broader
military
conflict
with
iran
asked
for
more
options
people
briefed
on
the
meeting
said
that
could
entail
a
strike
by
saudi
arabia
whose
oil
facilities
were
hit
sunday
in
an
unprecedented
attack
that
the
u.s.
would
support
with
intelligence
targeting
information
and
surveillance
capabilities
but
without
the
u.s.
actually
firing
any
weapons
at
iran
one
person
familiar
with
the
planning
said
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
still
in
the
wake
of
sunday's
attack
u.s.
military
planners
have
revisited
a
long-identified
list
of
potential
iranian
targets
that
could
constitute
a
proportional
response
those
include
a
strike
on
iran's
abadan
oil
refinery
one
of
the
world's
largest
or
kharg
island
iran's
biggest
oil
export
facility
attacks
on
either
location
would
significantly
impede
iran's
ability
to
process
and
sell
oil
which
the
trump
administration
has
already
been
working
to
restrict
after
pulling
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
other
possibilities
include
hitting
missile
launch
sites
bases
or
other
assets
belonging
to
the
islamic
revolutionary
guard
corps
the
elite
iranian
military
unit
blamed
for
much
of
iran's
paramilitary
operations
against
adversaries
outside
of
the
country
there
were
no
indications
that
any
u.s.
military
action
was
imminent
and
officials
said
that
no
decision
has
been
made
but
the
defense
department
is
also
working
through
options
to
increase
its
presence
in
the
region
by
sending
more
forces
and
military
assets
to
the
persian
gulf
officials
familiar
with
the
planning
said
trump's
desire
for
more
options
comes
amid
growing
confidence
by
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
iran
was
behind
sunday's
unprecedented
attack
on
saudi
oil
facilities
some
of
that
intelligence
pointing
to
iran
as
the
culprit
has
now
been
made
available
to
u.s.
senators
in
a
classified
reading
room
senators
and
their
aides
said
tuesday
i'm
like
percent
convinced
senate
homeland
security
committee
chairman
ron
johnson
r-wis
said
after
reading
the
intelligence
report
he
said
the
intelligence
made
available
was
about
three
pages
long
it's
very
brief
which
means
to
me
it's
pretty
cut
and
dry
although
trump
has
tweeted
that
the
united
states
is
locked
and
loaded
both
he
and
the
defense
department
are
deeply
reluctant
to
get
drawn
into
a
military
conflict
with
iran
those
concerns
have
prompted
a
renewed
look
at
non-military
responses
to
iran
such
as
a
covert
cyber
action
or
increased
sanctions
that
would
be
coordinated
with
other
countries
european
governments
have
condemned
the
attacks
but
have
stopped
short
of
pinning
the
blame
on
iran
a
european
official
told
nbc
news
it
was
highly
likely
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
though
governments
were
still
studying
intelligence
reports
the
trump
administration's
response
to
the
attacks
so
far
had
created
confusion
and
it
was
unclear
if
trump
still
wanted
to
pursue
talks
with
tehran
the
official
said
bradley
bowman
a
former
army
officer
and
senate
national
security
aide
said
the
goal
for
u.s.
military
planners
as
they
review
longstanding
options
should
be
to
re-establish
the
threat
of
deterrence
without
inflicting
significant
iranian
casualties
which
could
be
exploited
by
iran's
government
clearly
those
who
conducted
this
attack
were
not
deterred
that
means
inflicting
pain
said
bowman
now
a
senior
director
at
the
hawkish
think
tank
foundation
for
defense
of
democracies
but
we
want
that
pain
to
be
inflicted
in
a
wise
way
that
does
not
increase
the
credibility
in
the
eyes
of
the
iranian
people
of
a
regime
that
is
not
credible
any
u.s.
military
action
to
retaliate
for
a
strike
against
saudi
arabia
could
also
face
resistance
in
congress
lawmakers
of
both
parties
have
repeatedly
defied
the
president
by
pushing
to
limit
u.s.
military
cooperation
with
the
saudis
following
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
and
the
kingdom's
bloody
military
intervention
in
yemen
yet
the
trump
administration
has
worked
to
maintain
close
ties
to
saudi
arabia
and
its
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
in
a
conference
call
monday
with
house
and
senate
national
security
aides
brian
hook
the
top
state
department
official
handling
iran
policy
said
that
saudi
officials
had
impressed
on
the
u.s.
that
they
view
the
oil
facility
strikes
as
their
equivalent
to
sept
according
to
an
individual
who
participated
in
the
call
the
comparison
raised
eyebrows
among
congressional
staffers
considering
that
there
do
not
appear
to
have
been
any
casualties
in
sunday's
strike
and
that
of
the
hijackers
on
were
saudis
we
don't
have
defense
treaty
with
saudi
arabia
said
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
we
are
under
no
obligation
to
defend
saudi
arabia
and
we
have
no
interest
in
getting
involved
in
an
escalating
regional
conflict
between
those
two
countries
such
skepticism
about
military
action
has
also
extended
to
republicans
sen
john
barrasso
of
wyoming
said
he
did
not
favor
intervention
at
this
time
while
sen
mitt
romney
a
utah
republican
said
direct
u.s.
intervention
would
be
a
grave
mistake
trump
for
his
part
has
suggested
publicly
he
is
not
eager
for
war
and
that
he
did
not
definitively
blame
the
iranians
it's
looking
that
way
trump
said
monday
of
iran's
culpability
that's
being
checked
out
right
now
trump
said
the
u.s.
is
prepared
for
war
but
with
all
that
being
said
we'd
certainly
like
to
avoid
it
adding
that
he
believes
the
iranians
want
to
make
a
deal
complicating
trump's
deliberations
is
the
absence
of
a
full-fledged
national
security
adviser
whose
role
entails
coordinating
among
the
various
national
security
agencies
following
john
bolton's
departure
from
the
white
house
last
week
trump
has
named
deputy
national
security
adviser
charles
kupperman
as
his
acting
national
security
adviser
while
promising
to
select
a
replacement
soon
on
tuesday
trump
told
reporters
on
air
force
one
that
he
had
settled
on
five
potential
candidates
to
replace
bolton
