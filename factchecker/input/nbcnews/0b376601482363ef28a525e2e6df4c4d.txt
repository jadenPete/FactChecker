by

times
more

and

rural
states
meanwhile
have
the
highest
rates
of
gun
deaths
and
bear
the
largest
costs
as
a
share
of
their
economies
nationally
the
cost
of
gun
violence
in
the
u.s.
runs
billion
a
year
or
percent
of
the
gross
domestic
product
the
report
said
the
human
cost
is
beyond
our
ability
to
comprehend
it
is
tragic
it
is
sickening
and
it
is
a
crisis
rep
carolyn
maloney
d-n
y.
the
vice-chair
of
the
committee
said
in
a
news
conference
wednesday
the
gun
violence
needs
to
stop
and
we
need
to
make
it
happen
there
is
also
a
substantial
economic
cost
the
report
said
with
directly
measurable
costs
that
include
lost
income
and
spending
employer
costs
police
and
criminal
justice
responses
and
health
care
treatment
and
indirect
costs
that
include
reduced
quality
of
life
due
to
pain
and
suffering
gun
homicides
are
also
associated
with
fewer
jobs
lost
businesses
and
lower
home
values
in
local
economies
and
communities
across
the
nation
the
report
said
the
report
noted
however
that
the
economic
toll
of
gun
violence
is
difficult
to
measure
because
of
a
decades-old
federal
prohibition
on
funding
for
research
into
the
problem
since
congress
has
added
a
little-known
amendment
to
spending
legislation
that
prohibits
the
use
federal
funds
to
advocate
or
promote
gun
control
while
lawmakers
clarified
the
provision
in
a
spending
package
last
year
stating
that
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
can
conduct
research
on
the
causes
of
gun
violence
no
money
was
allocated
for
such
research
in
the
wake
of
multiple
mass
shootings
this
year
gun
control
advocates
and
a
growing
number
of
democrats
have
been
calling
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
to
take
up
legislation
to
combat
the
problem
congress
remains
at
an
impasse
over
gun-control
legislation
in
part
because
president
donald
trump
has
not
yet
made
clear
what
measures
he
would
be
willing
to
back
mcconnell
said
tuesday
that
he
is
awaiting
guidance
from
the
white
house
about
what
the
president
who
previously
expressed
some
interest
in
expanding
gun
background
checks
is
comfortable
signing
while
a
bipartisan
background
check
bill
passed
the
democrat-controlled
house
in
february
trump
has
threatened
to
veto
it
the
joint
congressional
committee's
report
largely
complied
with
data
from
the
giffords
law
center
to
prevent
gun
violence
and
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
urged
immediate
action
there
have
been
mass
shootings
in
america
in
so
far
according
to
the
gun
violence
archive
a
nonprofit
that
tracks
gun-related
deaths
and
injuries
based
on
official
records
the
committee
report
found
that
alaska
montana
alabama
louisiana
and
missouri
have
the
highest
rate
of
gun
deaths
with
an
economic
cost
of
roughly
billion
however
suicides
make
up
the
majority
of
firearm-related
deaths
about
percent
the
report
said
and
suicides
by
young
americans
have
trended
upward
over
the
last
decade
the
report
found
that
states
with
high
rates
of
gun
ownership
alaska
arkansas
idaho
montana
west
virginia
and
wyoming
have
the
highest
rates
of
gun
suicide
and
for
every
percent
increase
in
household
gun
ownership
the
youth
suicide
rate
increases
by
more
than
percent
it
found
it
also
found
economically
deprived
areas
outside
of
rural
america
are
also
hit
hard
about
african
americans
die
from
gun
violence
every
year
the
report
said
making
it
times
more
likely
that
a
young
black
male
will
die
by
a
firearm
homicide
than
a
white
peer
the
committee
held
a
hearing
on
the
report
