share
this
what
trump
got
right
and
wrong
about
his
new
border
barrier
after
two
and
a
half
years
the
u.s.
border
wall
hasn't
grown
it's
just
been
fixed
up
president
donald
trump
toured
a
section
of
newly-upgraded
border
barrier
along
the
california-mexico
border
on
wednesday
boasting
about
giving
the
nation
the
strong
impressive
wall
he
promised
during
his
campaign
for
many
years
people
have
wanted
a
proper
wall
trump
told
reporters
predicting
he'd
finish
building
miles
by
the
end
of
next
year
we're
building
it
at
a
breakneck
speed
trump
spoke
with
reporters
in
between
two
sets
of
fencing
primary
foot
tall
fencing
and
secondary
foot
tall
fencing
in
otay
mesa
california
trump
acknowledged
that
much
of
the
work
completed
under
his
administration
amounted
to
renovation
but
he
also
inaccurately
suggested
that
he
had
built
walls
in
certain
areas
where
before
nothing
existed
and
changed
his
story
about
how
mexico
is
paying
for
the
wall
while
misstating
details
about
the
new
barrier
itself
we
had
very
low
fencing
it
was
like
a
sheet
metal
people
would
knock
it
over
like
routinely
we
ripped
it
out
we
had
a
lot
of
areas
where
we
had
that
or
less
than
that
and
we
had
some
areas
where
we
had
nothing
he
told
reporters
at
one
point
so
far
under
trump
the
u.s.
has
replaced
or
reinforced
miles
of
fencing
including
miles
of
new
secondary
fencing
like
the
kind
the
president
stood
in
front
of
on
wednesday
but
trump's
administration
has
yet
to
extend
the
border
wall
there
are
miles
of
border
wall
in
the
u.s.
according
to
customs
and
border
protection
data
the
same
number
of
miles
that
existed
at
the
start
of
his
term
trump
when
asked
by
a
reporter
about
his
campaign
promise
that
mexico
would
pay
for
his
wall
trump
claimed
mexico
was
paying
with
its
decision
to
police
the
border
with
soldiers
well
they're
paying
for
soldiers
i
am
we're
all
thrilled
mexico
has
never
done
anything
to
impede
people
from
pouring
into
our
country
trump
said
but
if
i
charged
a
percent
tariff
on
mexico
for
six
months
that
would
fully
pay
for
the
wall
mexico
deployed
soldiers
to
the
u.s.
mexican
border
this
summer
not
speaking
to
reporters
trump
pointed
to
the
interior
of
the
steel
bollard
fencing
which
has
reinforcing
bars
and
concrete
inside
and
said
the
walls
were
wired
to
detect
attempts
to
cross
he
said
three
countries
had
sent
representatives
to
study
the
wall
declining
to
name
those
nations
it's
a
very
powerful
wall
the
likes
of
which
to
this
extent
has
not
been
built
before
he
said
he
inaccurately
suggested
that
the
kind
of
wall
being
built
behind
him
was
based
on
the
climb-ability
of
the
prototypes
he
had
constructed
early
in
his
term
none
of
the
prototypes
passed
cbp's
operational
testing
and
the
steel
bollard
design
has
been
used
for
years
lawmakers
actually
specifically
wrote
into
the
funding
bill
that
new
designs
couldn't
be
used
after
congress
refused
to
pony
up
enough
money
for
the
border
wall
trump
sought
out
alternate
funding
from
the
defense
department
the
pentagon
said
this
month
it
would
use
billion
in
military
construction
funding
to
build
the
wall
while
the
defense
department
also
made
billions
of
counter-drug
money
available
cbp
predicted
they'll
be
able
to
build
total
miles
with
this
boost
of
funding
on
top
of
congressional
appropriations
but
just
of
that
barrier
will
be
new
primary
wall
and
levee
walls
where
no
barrier
existed
before
there
are
some
signs
that
truly
new
border
wall
is
in
the
works
last
month
cbp
awarded
a
contract
for
an
mile
section
of
levee
wall
writing
for
the
first
time
in
a
press
release
that
construction
will
take
place
in
locations
where
no
barriers
currently
exist
it
just
hasn't
happened
yet
