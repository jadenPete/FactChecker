story

the

the

efforts

intervene
in
the

probe
washington
corey
lewandowski's
congressional
testimony
on
tuesday
may
have
felt
a
bit
circus-like
at
times
for
house
democrats
but
it
was
a
disaster
for
president
donald
trump
the
first
hearing
of
the
democratic-led
house
judiciary
committee's
effort
to
develop
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
was
a
contentious
affair
in
which
lewandowski
trump's
campaign
manager
and
the
lone
witness
said
democrats
hate
this
president
more
than
they
love
their
country
but
no
one
not
lewandowski
nor
committee
republicans
seriously
disputed
the
central
theme
of
the
day
that
trump
had
gone
to
extreme
lengths
in
circumventing
the
entirety
of
the
federal
government
to
get
lewandowski
to
instruct
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
publicly
announce
that
the
president
had
done
nothing
wrong
and
limit
the
scope
of
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
probe
in
ultimately
lewandowski
put
flesh
on
the
bones
that
mueller
gave
the
committee
in
his
report
and
as
nbc's
geoff
bennett
reports
democrats
believe
trump's
efforts
to
exercise
control
over
lewandowski's
testimony
through
its
assertion
of
executive
privilege
and
the
use
of
white
house
lawyers
to
monitor
his
remarks
may
open
a
new
pathway
to
an
impeachable
obstruction
of
justice
offense
they
liken
trump's
moves
to
actions
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
third
article
of
impeachment
the
judiciary
committee
drafted
against
president
richard
nixon
who
ultimately
resigned
before
the
full
house
could
vote
on
whether
to
impeach
him
either
way
lewandowski's
appearance
delivered
what
the
democrats
wanted
and
the
process
wasn't
pretty
for
trump
over
the
course
of
several
hours
lewandowski
slowly
and
perhaps
unwittingly
added
movie-like
color
and
a
few
new
morsels
to
mueller's
dry
narrative
of
trump's
decision
to
lean
on
a
trusted
confidant
to
carry
out
a
special
mission
that
all
the
president's
men
and
women
had
refused
to
execute
for
fear
of
breaking
the
law
the
cloak-and-dagger
details
included
lewandowski
taking
down
careful
notes
in
the
oval
office
sticking
them
in
a
safe
at
home
and
trying
once
to
schedule
a
meeting
with
sessions
outside
the
justice
department
and
its
visitor
logs
only
to
be
frustrated
by
sessions
canceling
trump
asked
lewandowski
to
do
that
after
then-white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
declined
to
fire
mueller
at
trump's
direction
according
to
mueller's
report
barry
berke
a
consultant
serving
as
counsel
for
committee
democrats
later
asked
lewandowski
about
passages
in
lewandowski's
book
let
trump
be
trump
the
inside
story
of
his
rise
to
the
presidency
that
detail
white
house
deliberations
about
bringing
in
lewandowski
to
run
the
russia
investigation
just
weeks
earlier
lewandowski
said
the
job
was
then-white
house
chief
of
staff's
reince
priebus's
idea
not
trump's
and
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
trump
was
not
intentionally
dangling
the
possibility
of
a
high-ranking
west
wing
post
in
front
of
lewandowski
while
asking
him
to
gut
the
special
counsel
probe
asked
by
rep
steve
cohen
d-tenn
whether
he
was
picked
for
the
sessions
assignment
because
trump
thought
you
would
play
whatever
role
he
wanted
because
it
was
illegal
lewandowski
curiously
chose
not
to
criticize
the
premise
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
president
congressman
lewandowski
replied
he
had
said
moments
earlier
that
he
believed
he
was
never
asked
to
do
anything
illegal
but
also
repeatedly
asserted
that
he
is
not
a
lawyer
what
democrats
were
trying
to
show
was
that
lewandowski
was
an
essential
player
in
an
attempt
by
trump
to
obstruct
justice
by
sabotaging
the
mueller
probe
though
lewandowski
denied
it
they
contended
the
longtime
political
operative's
sense
of
self-preservation
his
understanding
that
he
was
putting
himself
at
legal
risk
stopped
him
from
carrying
out
orders
from
trump
the
president
never
asked
me
to
do
anything
illegal
and
he
never
asked
me
to
keep
anything
secret
lewandowski
said
at
a
second
white
house
conclave
a
month
later
lewandowski
told
the
president
that
he
would
tell
sessions
what
to
do
if
sessions
wouldn't
meet
with
him
trump
said
lewandowski
should
tell
sessions
he
would
be
fired
i
took
that
as
a
joke
lewandowski
testified
but
rather
than
meeting
with
sessions
or
threatening
that
he
would
be
fired
lewandowski
passed
that
job
off
to
rick
dearborn
a
white
house
official
dearborn
sat
on
it
democrats
said
their
behavior
was
evidence
that
they
knew
the
president
was
acting
improperly
rick
dearborn
knew
delivering
the
message
was
wrong
you
knew
it
was
wrong
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
said
as
he
questioned
lewandowski
that's
why
even
after
being
asked
to
deliver
it
and
saying
you
would
handle
it
soon
you
passed
it
off
to
him
and
you
never
followed
up
i
think
the
president
asking
a
private
citizen
to
try
to
scare
his
attorney
general
into
ending
the
investigation
into
the
president's
conduct
is
obstruction
of
justice
plain
and
simple
at
times
the
hearing
was
a
partisan
food
fight
with
democrats
accusing
lewandowski
of
using
his
time
to
prep
a
senate
run
in
new
hampshire
lewandowski
and
rep
eric
swalwell
d-calif
engaged
in
several
minutes
of
third-grade
quarreling
over
who
would
read
a
quotation
from
a
video
screen
and
republicans
called
for
several
dilatory
roll-call
votes
over
various
injustices
real
or
perceived
democrats
on
the
committee
repeatedly
asked
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
whether
he
would
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
of
the
committee
and
nadler
scolded
him
for
repeatedly
declining
to
answer
questions
by
citing
a
controversial
assertion
of
executive
privilege
by
the
white
house
lewandowski
has
never
worked
for
trump
in
the
administration
and
democrats
contend
that
his
conversations
with
trump
cannot
legally
be
protected
from
testimony
by
an
executive
privilege
when
the
hearing
was
turned
over
to
hired
lawyers
lewandowski
acknowledged
that
he
sometimes
misrepresents
facts
when
he's
not
under
oath
berke
played
a
clip
of
lewandowski
telling
msnbc's
ari
melber
that
the
president
hadn't
asked
him
to
engage
with
sessions
on
the
russia
probe
i
have
no
obligation
to
be
honest
with
the
media
lewandowski
said
adding
that
the
media
are
just
as
dishonest
as
anyone
else
in
the
end
trump
who
had
praised
lewandowski
on
twitter
earlier
in
the
day
was
left
worse
for
wear
lewandowski
had
effectively
colored
in
the
outlines
mueller
had
left
of
one
set
of
trump's
efforts
to
interfere
in
the
russia
probe
the
only
question
one
for
congress
to
decide
after
it
has
collected
more
testimony
is
whether
that
picture
looks
like
criminal
obstruction
of
justice
by
the
president
