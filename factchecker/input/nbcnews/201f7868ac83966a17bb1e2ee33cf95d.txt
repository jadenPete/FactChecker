financial
services
general
government
bill
will
include
a
bipartisan
amendment
providing
another
million
for
the

of
their

improve
their
defenses
and
shore
up
their

mcconnell
said
i
am
proud
to
have
helped
develop
this
amendment
and
to
co-sponsor
it
in
committee
mcconnell's
backing
comes
after
democrats
have
been
putting
political
pressure
on
him
and
republicans
for
more
than
a
year
to
get
behind
additional
provisions
including
new
funding
to
protect
against
hacking
and
interference
in
the
elections
this
morning
after
months
and
months
and
months
of
republican
resistance
and
months
of
insistent
democratic
pressure
senate
republicans
have
finally
agreed
to
support
our
democratic
request
for
additional
election
security
funding
in
advance
of
the
elections
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
said
on
the
senate
floor
democrats
brought
up
a
similar
measure
last
year
that
would
have
also
provided
an
additional
million
to
the
states
but
mcconnell
and
most
republicans
opposed
it
a
senior
republican
leadership
aide
said
the
measure
was
brought
up
when
states
still
had
not
determined
how
they'd
spend
the
million
they
were
given
in
in
july
democrats
attempted
again
to
bring
election
security
legislation
to
the
floor
mcconnell's
opposition
to
the
measure
that
would
have
made
broad
changes
to
the
election
system
led
in
part
to
critics
giving
him
the
moniker
of
moscow
mitch
republicans
pointed
to
an
election
briefing
by
intelligence
officials
in
july
as
reason
that
more
money
wasn't
necessary
all
the
money
hadn't
been
spent
that
we
gave
to
the
states
sen
richard
burr
r-n
c.
chair
of
the
senate
intelligence
committee
told
nbc
news
at
the
time
referring
to
funds
granted
to
the
states
ahead
of
the
elections
now
that
mcconnell
is
backing
the
funding
democrats
and
election
security
experts
say
that
million
is
a
good
start
but
not
enough
sen
mark
warner
d-va
vice
chair
of
the
senate
intelligence
committee
which
wrote
a
report
on
the
security
vulnerabilities
in
the
election
said
that
million
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
part
of
securing
our
elections
against
foreign
attack
aaron
scherb
director
of
legislative
affairs
at
common
cause
said
that
far
more
is
needed
to
secure
the
election
system
providing
million
in
additional
election
security
funding
is
like
asking
an
army
to
go
fight
a
war
with
horses
and
bayonets
scherb
said
the
house
passed
a
bill
that
would
give
states
nearly
three
times
more
million
a
republican
senator
on
background
acknowledges
that
this
million
is
a
fig
leaf
republicans
attempt
to
keep
democrats
from
obtaining
the
hundreds
of
millions
more
they
want
for
election
security
what
changed
for
some
people
was
that
democrats
would
probably
pass
an
amount
of
money
that
was
substantially
bigger

senator
said
