hours
after

environmental
activist
greta
thunberg

emotional
speech
at
the
united

president
donald
trump
appeared
to
mock
her
on

own
at
him
she
seems
like
a
very
happy
young
girl
looking
forward
to
a
bright
and

to

trump
wrote
late
monday
retweeting
a
video
of
the
teen
giving
an
impassioned
plea
at
the
united
nations
climate
action
summit
thunberg
did
not
respond
directly
to
trump
but
several
hours
later
she
updated
her
twitter
bio
to
mimic
his
tweet
a
very
happy
young
girl
looking
forward
to
a
bright
and
wonderful
future
her
bio
read
an
update
from
her
previous
description
which
said
year
old
climate
activist
with
asperger's
join
the
global
climate
strikes
on
sept
th
fridaysforfuture
in
her
speech
a
tearful
and
sometimes
trembling
thunberg
accused
world
leaders
of
stealing
her
dreams
and
her
childhood
with
their
inaction
on
climate
change
a
cause
she
has
championed
and
turned
into
a
global
movement
through
the
fridays
for
future
school
strikes
she
launched
i
shouldn't
be
up
here
i
should
be
back
at
school
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
said
the
year-old
from
sweden
yet
you
all
come
to
us
young
people
for
hope
how
dare
you
you
have
stolen
my
dreams
and
my
childhood
with
your
empty
words
we
are
in
the
beginning
of
a
mass
extinction
and
all
you
can
talk
about
is
money
and
fairy
tales
of
eternal
economic
growth
she
added
for
more
than
years
the
science
has
been
crystal
clear
how
dare
you
continue
to
look
away
and
come
here
saying
that
you're
doing
enough
when
the
politics
and
solutions
needed
are
still
nowhere
in
sight
after
the
speech
thunberg's
name
was
trending
worldwide
on
social
media
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
from
nbc
news
regarding
trump's
comments
thunberg's
appeal
to
the
u.n.
was
widely
praised
among
those
who
voiced
support
was
democratic
presidential
contender
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
who
wrote
on
twitter
that
thunberg
was
right
we
are
currently
failing
our
nation's
youth
by
not
taking
swift
action
to
combat
the
climate
crisis
but
it
also
became
a
flashpoint
for
some
on
fox
news
on
monday
night
the
daily
wire's
michael
knowles
called
thunberg
who
has
asperger's
syndrome
a
diagnosis
she
has
embraced
as
her
superpower
mentally
ill
if
it
were
about
science
it
would
be
led
by
scientists
rather
than
by
politicians
and
a
mentally
ill
swedish
child
who
is
being
exploited
by
her
parents
and
by
the
international
left
he
said
the
network
later
issued
an
apology
to
thunberg
calling
knowles
comment
disgraceful
and
sebastian
gorka
former
deputy
assistant
to
trump
compared
thunberg
to
a
victim
of
a
maoist
re-education
camp
tweeting
that
the
adults
who
brainwashed
her
should
be
charged
with
child
abuse
trump's
stance
on
climate
change
which
he
has
referred
to
as
a
hoax
has
drawn
ire
from
many
in
the
international
community
in
he
announced
the
u.s.
would
pull
out
of
the
paris
agreement
a
landmark
global
accord
to
curb
emissions
throughout
his
administration
he
has
rolled
back
and
reversed
a
series
of
environmental
protections
thunberg
has
not
held
back
in
the
past
about
her
contempt
for
trump
last
month
she
told
the
new
york
times
my
message
to
him
is
just
to
listen
to
the
science
and
he
obviously
doesn't
do
that
a
gif
of
thunberg
glaring
at
trump
as
he
passed
by
her
at
the
summit
on
monday
in
a
brief
surprise
appearance
got
almost
as
much
attention
online
as
her
speech
did
thunberg
initially
began
her
climate
protest
on
her
own
sitting
outside
swedish
parliament
in
august
following
sweden's
hottest
summer
on
record
she
is
a
nominee
for
the
nobel
peace
prize
which
is
awarded
in
october
thunberg
arrived
in
the
united
states
late
last
month
due
to
high
levels
of
emissions
from
air
travel
she
abstains
from
flying
and
instead
traveled
across
the
atlantic
ocean
by
sailboat
to
attend
the
climate
summit
