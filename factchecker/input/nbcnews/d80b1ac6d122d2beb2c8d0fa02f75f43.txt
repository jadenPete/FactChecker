the
afghan
government
has
clashed
with
president
donald
trump's
envoy
over
a
proposed
troop
withdrawal
deal
with
the
taliban
just
as
washington
is
preparing
to
unveil

foreign

afghan
officials
and
former
u.s.
officials
said
afghan
officials
and
u.s.
special
envoy
zalmay
khalilzad
had
tense
exchanges
in
kabul
over
the
past
few
days
after
the
american
diplomat
briefed
president
ashraf
ghani
and
his
advisers
on
the
proposed
deal
with
the
taliban
a
foreign
diplomat
and
two
former
u.s.
officials
said
ghani's
government
responded
to
the
briefing
badly
and
the
discussions
were
marked
by
raging
arguments
said
one
foreign
diplomat
familiar
with
the
talks
the
state
department
declined
to
comment
on
the
discussions
in
kabul
or
on
details
of
the
proposed
u.s.
taliban
deal
the
proposed
agreement
in
principle
with
the
taliban
would
see
the
phased
withdrawal
of
u.s.
troops
in
return
for
the
taliban
agreeing
to
enter
into
peace
talks
with
the
afghan
government
and
pledging
not
to
allow
areas
under
their
control
to
be
used
as
a
launching
pad
for
al
qaeda
islamic
state
or
other
terrorist
groups
khalilzad
said
this
week
that
if
the
agreement
is
approved
by
president
trump
the
united
states
would
initially
pull
out
about
troops
in
days
the
afghan
government
which
has
long
been
wary
of
the
u.s.
taliban
talks
and
was
never
invited
to
take
part
worries
that
american
troops
could
be
withdrawn
before
a
peace
agreement
is
firmly
in
place
and
that
washington
may
have
made
too
many
concessions
to
their
adversaries
foreign
diplomats
and
afghan
officials
said
the
concerns
are
very
high
not
just
for
the
government
but
also
for
the
people
of
afghanistan
because
the
people
of
afghanistan
have
been
bitten
by
this
snake
before
waheed
omer
a
senior
adviser
to
the
afghan
president
told
a
press
briefing
in
kabul
on
thursday
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
we
are
still
not
assured
of
what
the
agreement's
consequences
could
have
for
afghanistan's
future
omer
said
our
position
is
that
we
need
more
debate
on
this
agreement
state
department
officials
said
that
on
thursday
khalilzad
flew
to
the
qatari
capital
of
doha
where
he
has
previously
held
talks
with
the
taliban
the
taliban
maintain
a
political
office
in
qatar
it
was
unclear
if
khalilzad
would
attempt
to
secure
substantial
changes
to
the
deal
which
follows
nearly
a
year
of
unprecedented
negotiations
between
the
taliban
and
the
united
states
to
reassure
the
afghan
government
the
u.s.
is
considering
a
separate
joint
statement
or
declaration
that
would
make
clear
existing
bilateral
agreements
between
the
two
countries
would
remain
in
effect
according
to
a
foreign
diplomat
and
a
u.s.
source
familiar
with
the
matter
in
addition
the
afghan
government
would
acknowledge
but
not
endorse
the
u.s.
taliban
deal
the
sources
said
if
the
taliban
deal
enters
into
force
the
taliban
and
the
afghan
government
would
start
peace
talks
in
oslo
later
this
month
but
a
major
sticking
point
is
president
ghani's
vow
to
hold
elections
as
scheduled
on
sept
which
some
western
governments
worry
could
cause
more
political
turmoil
and
leave
afghan
negotiators
divided
as
they
try
to
hammer
out
a
peace
accord
with
the
taliban
some
of
ghani's
political
rivals
also
oppose
going
ahead
with
the
polls
the
talks
with
the
afghan
government
this
week
coincided
with
a
series
of
deadly
attacks
including
a
suicide
bombing
in
kabul
on
monday
and
a
bombing
thursday
near
an
afghan
intelligence
office
that
killed
civilians
and
two
nato
service
members
a
romanian
and
an
american
the
trump
administration
has
offered
few
details
about
the
taliban
talks
and
has
rarely
explained
its
approach
publicly
khalilzad
who
struck
an
optimistic
note
earlier
this
week
faces
increasing
criticism
over
the
negotiations
from
both
ends
of
the
political
spectrum
including
from
conservative
commentators
former
military
commanders
and
diplomats
and
u.s.
lawmakers
rep

on
thursday
of
stonewalling
congress
and
failing
to
keep
the
public
informed
about
negotiations
aimed
at
ending
america's
longest
war
engel
in
a
letter
to

demanded
the

testify
before
the
committee
so
that
congress
and
the
american
people
will
have
the
long-overdue
opportunity
to
understand
the
contours
of
your
negotiations
with

skeptics

charged
the
trump
administration
with
backing
away
from
tougher
positions
over
the
past
several
months
including
an
earlier
insistence
on
ensuring
the
taliban
agree
to
a
countrywide
ceasefire
