the
department
of
the
interior
has
decided
to
halt
its
sponsorship
of
all
house
trips
to
various
agency
sites
around
the
country
until
a
resolution
can
be
found
to
a
dispute
over
the
rules
of
engagement
between
congressional
staff
and
the
career
and
political
officials
who
facilitate
the
oversight
visits
according
to
a
senior

official
the
interior

oversees
the
bureau
of
land
management
the
national
park
service
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
several
other
agencies
the
decision
which
had
not
officially
been
rendered
to
capitol
hill
as
of
early
wednesday
evening
was
driven
by
interior
department
chief
of
staff
todd
willens
according
to
the
official
who
spoke
to
nbc
news
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
internal
deliberations
it
was
willens
who
requested
that
house
appropriations
committee
staff
member
peter
kiefhaber
return
immediately
to
washington
after
an
incident
during
a
house
appropriations
staff
tour
of
blm
sites
in
nevada
in
late
august
in
which
willens
described
kiefhaber's
behavior
toward
a
washington-based
blm
official
as
overly
aggressive
and
unprofessional
as
you
are
an
official
on
travel
paid
by
the
department
we
have
determined
that
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
return
to
your
duty
station
in
washington
dc
on
the
next
available
flight
willens
wrote
in
an
email
sent
to
kiefhaber
and
provided
to
nbc
news
this
decision
was
made
in
the
best
interest
of
the
safety
and
well-being
of
our
employees
and
to
ensure
that
the
trip
can
continue
without
further
incident
evan
hollander
spokesman
for
the
house
appropriations
committee
fired
back
in
an
email
to
nbc
news
senior
staff
at
interior
have
concocted
this
entire
incident
to
stymie
the
house's
critical
oversight
work
hollander
wrote
fabricating
a
story
to
block
congressional
oversight
is
another
example
of
the
trump
administration's
trampling
of
democratic
norms
and
congressional
democrats
will
not
stand
for
this
illegal
and
outrageous
conduct
on
sept
willens
sent
a
letter
to
the
house
ethics
committee
about
the
incident
requesting
an
investigation
in
which
he
alleged
kiefhaber
had
blocked
acting
blm
chief
of
staff
amanda
kaster
from
entering
a
meeting
called
her
a
minder
to
the
media
and
verbally
accosted
and
bullied
her
the
democratic-run
house
appropriations
committee
has
defended
its
work
and
kiefhaber
a
longtime
aide
to
appropriators
on
both
sides
of
the
capitol
committee
staff
portrayed
his
interaction
with
kaster
as
him
telling
her
she
was
rude
because
she
didn't
inform
him
ahead
of
time
that
she
would
be
joining
meetings
with
agency
officials
in
the
field
democrats
also
believe
the
battle
is
a
proxy
fight
in
a
larger
war
between
subcommittee
chairwoman
betty
mccollum
d-minn
and
secretary
david
bernhardt
over
the
department's
plans
to
relocate
interior
staff
from
washington
to
grand
junction
colorado
and
mccollum's
efforts
to
intervene
more
broadly
the
administration
and
the
democratic-led
house
have
been
grappling
over
congressional
oversight
power
since
january
house
appropriations
staff
noted
thursday
that
a
law
dating
back
as
far
as
requires
that
some
of
the
funds
congress
spends
on
agencies
must
be
made
available
to
examine
how
appropriated
money
is
being
used
in
the
field
