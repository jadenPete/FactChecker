help
him
in
the
election

harm
the
country
two
hundred

almost
the
entire
member
caucus

type
of
impeachment
action
in
light
of
president
donald
trump's
burgeoning
ukraine
scandal
the
fast-expanding
list
includes
nearly
lawmakers
who
have
come
out
in
favor
of
action
since
reports
last
week
that
the
president
pushed
ukraine
to
investigate
the
biden
family
in
addition
to
the
democrats
rep
justin
amash
a
michigan
independent
also
favors
an
impeachment
investigation
read
the
full
list
here
some
on
this
list
have
called
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
or
hearings
some
believe
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
already
undertaking
an
inquiry
and
are
supportive
of
that
investigation
while
others
have
gone
further
and
called
for
drafting
articles
of
impeachment
lawmakers
are
using
different
terms
when
they
talk
about
the
issue
with
pressure
growing
within
her
caucus
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
on
tuesday
night
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
into
the
president's
actions
which
she
said
seriously
violated
the
constitution
and
revealed
the
dishonorable
fact
of
the
president's
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
betrayal
of
our
national
security
and
betrayal
of
the
integrity
of
our
elections
pelosi
made
the
announcement
after
meeting
with
the
democratic
leadership
key
committee
chairmen
and
the
rest
of
the
caucus
earlier
in
the
afternoon
trump
responded
on
twitter
within
minutes
calling
the
announcement
witch
hunt
garbage
and
presidential
harassment
the
president
earlier
told
reporters
that
an
impeachment
inquiry
would
help
him
in
the
election
but
would
harm
the
country
the
recent
impeachment
drive
follows
days
of
revelations
surrounding
trump's
apparent
push
to
have
the
ukrainian
government
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
who
had
business
dealings
in
the
country
nbc
news
confirmed
that
trump
instructed
his
chief
of
staff
to
place
a
hold
on
about
million
in
military
aid
for
ukraine
in
the
days
before
a
late
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
as
reported
by
the
washington
post
and
other
media
outlets
monday
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
article
monday
night
seven
freshman
house
democrats
called
for
impeachment
hearings
in
response
to
the
controversy
which
three
sources
told
nbc
news
might
give
pelosi
cover
to
back
a
formal
impeachment
proceeding
against
the
president
this
is
major
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
an
inflection
point
one
source
said
in
the
op-ed
article
reps
gil
cisneros
of
california
jason
crow
of
colorado
chrissy
houlahan
of
pennsylvania
mikie
sherrill
of
new
jersey
elaine
luria
and
abigail
spanberger
both
of
virginia
and
elissa
slotkin
of
michigan
said
their
experiences
in
the
military
defense
and
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
helped
shape
their
decision
these
allegations
are
stunning
both
in
the
national
security
threat
they
pose
and
the
potential
corruption
they
represent
they
wrote
speaking
with
msnbc's
morning
joe
on
tuesday
spanberger
and
slotkin
expanded
upon
their
op-ed
saying
the
ukraine
allegations
are
a
threat
to
u.s.
democracy
and
by
the
way
i
mean
people
don't
remember
it
but
there's
a
hot
war
going
on
in
eastern
ukraine
slotkin
said
so
you
start
holding
back
security
assistance
that's
a
real
lever
to
use
with
people
but
the
very
basic
idea
of
getting
foreign
help
to
influence
american
political
process
that
is
beyond
the
pale
other
signs
of
a
shift
in
approach
on
the
impeachment
question
became
apparent
tuesday
speaking
on
the
house
floor
rep
john
lewis
d-ga
a
close
pelosi
ally
said
that
he
is
deeply
concerned
about
the
future
of
our
democracy
and
that
people
approach
him
everywhere
saying
that
they
believe
our
nation
is
descending
into
darkness
i
share
their
concerns
for
the
future
of
our
country
he
said
i
believe
i
truly
believe
the
time
to
begin
impeachment
proceedings
against
this
president
has
come
to
delay
or
to
do
otherwise
would
betray
the
foundation
our
democracy
a
senior
aide
to
a
house
democrat
told
nbc
news
on
tuesday
morning
that
to
or
more
democrats
could
announce
support
for
impeachment
action
through
the
day
i
think
we
may
have
critical
mass
by
the
end
of
the
week
assuming
the
administration
continues
to
refuse
on
the
whistleblower
docs
the
source
said
citing
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
sparked
the
wave
of
scrutiny
regarding
the
president
and
ukraine
senate
democratic
whip
dick
durbin
of
illinois
also
joined
the
calls
for
beginning
an
impeachment
inquiry
saying
tuesday
i
think
this
may
be
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back
there's
so
much
cumulative
evidence
here
and
many
of
us
have
wondered
if
this
would
ever
see
the
light
of
day
in
an
impeachment
inquiry
durbin
added
but
i
think
now
we
have
to
move
forward
trump
defends
his
actions
on
ukraine
in
response
to
the
outcry
over
his
call
with
zelensky
and
the
timing
of
the
delay
in
ukraine
aid
trump
announced
tuesday
that
he
would
release
the
complete
fully
declassified
and
unredacted
transcript
of
his
conversation
with
the
ukrainian
president
you
will
see
it
was
a
very
friendly
and
totally
appropriate
call
trump
tweeted
no
pressure
and
unlike
joe
biden
and
his
son
no
quid
pro
quo
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
the
greatest
and
most
destructive
witch
hunt
of
all
time
speaking
to
reporters
at
the
united
nations
earlier
tuesday
trump
called
the
ratcheting
up
of
impeachment
talk
a
ridiculous
witch
hunt
and
insisted
his
call
with
zelensky
was
perfect
the
president
claimed
the
only
way
democrats
could
defeat
him
in
is
through
impeachment
saying
this
has
never
happened
to
a
president
before
and
this
is
nonsense
asked
about
the
hold
on
military
aid
trump
said
he
wants
other
countries
in
europe
to
pay
for
ukraine's
aid
as
well
but
he
said
he
released
the
hold
when
other
people
called
him
and
said
oh
let
it
go
trump
has
already
admitted
to
talking
about
biden
with
zelensky
and
in
discussing
that
conversation
with
reporters
on
monday
tied
the
military
aide
to
the
country's
probing
of
corruption
we
want
to
make
sure
that
country
is
honest
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
corruption
trump
said
monday
if
you
don't
talk
about
corruption
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
corrupt
later
in
the
day
trump
denied
any
quid
pro
quo
where
he
pledged
to
give
ukraine
the
money
in
exchange
for
further
probing
of
the
bidens
i
put
no
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
he
said
i
could
have
i
think
it
would
probably
possibly
have
been
ok
if
i
did
but
i
didn't
i
didn't
put
any
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
the
trump-zelensky
discussion
came
under
sharp
scrutiny
following
the
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
media
reports
said
was
tied
to
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
the
administration
is
refusing
to
turn
that
complaint
over
to
congress
in
a
letter
to
colleagues
on
sunday
pelosi
threatened
a
new
stage
of
investigation
if
the
trump
administration
and
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
fail
to
provide
the
whistleblower
complaint
when
maguire
testifies
in
front
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
she
said
tuesday
that
the
house
would
vote
a
resolution
on
wednesday
expressing
disapproval
of
the
administration's
effort
to
block
the
release
of
the
whistleblower's
complaint
maguire
and
the
national
intelligence
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
are
also
set
to
appear
before
the
senate
intelligence
committee
behind
closed
doors
thursday
afternoon
biden
who
like
pelosi
had
been
hesitant
to
call
for
impeachment
proceedings
against
the
president
said
tuesday
that
he
would
support
doing
so
if
trump
fails
to
comply
with
congressional
investigators
if
the
president
does
not
comply
with
such
a
request
from
the
congress
if
he
continues
to
obstruct
congress
and
flout
the
law
donald
trump
will
leave
congress
in
my
view
no
choice
but
to
initiate
impeachment
biden
said
during
brief
remarks
at
the
hotel
du
pont
in
wilmington
delaware
that
would
be
a
tragedy
but
a
tragedy
of
his
own
making
on
saturday
ukrainian
foreign
minister
vadym
prystaiko
said
he
didn't
think
trump
pressured
zelensky
during
the
phone
call
trump
and
zelensky
were
set
to
meet
face
to
face
this
week
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
session
in
new
york
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
have
engaged
in
a
monthslong
effort
to
have
ukraine
probe
the
bidens
an
effort
aided
by
the
state
department
it
centers
on
the
former
vice
president's
call
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
that
included
a
call
to
remove
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
one
of
the
cases
that
shokin
was
investigating
involved
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
at
the
time
included
biden's
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
and
politifact
reported
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
