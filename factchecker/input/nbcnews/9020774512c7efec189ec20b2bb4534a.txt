slated
to

r-utah
said
he
was
disappointed
by
the
move
funding
the
border
wall
is
an
important
priority
and
the
executive
branch
should
use
the
appropriate
channels
in
congress
rather
than
divert
already
appropriated
funding
away
from
military
construction
projects
and
therefore
undermining
military
readiness

that
the
president
has
been
forced
to
divert
funding
for
our
troops
to
address
the
crisis
thornberry
said
it
is
important
that
congress
now
restore
the
military
