share
this
status
quo
remains
intact
after
third
democratic
debate
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
for
everything
that
was
different
about
last
night's
democratic
presidential
debate
finally
just
one
night
joe
biden
and
elizabeth
warren
sharing
the
same
stage
so
much
seemed
the
same
the
same
opening
questions
on
health
care
and
medicare
for
all
the
same
divide
between
progressives
and
pragmatists
pretty
much
the
same
questions
on
race
and
immigration
and
the
same
dynamic
with
a
low-polling
young
candidate
this
time
juli
n
castro
taking
a
not-so-subtle
shot
at
biden's
age
now
there
were
some
other
differences
biden
despite
his
characteristic
verbal
tics
and
unclear
syntax
had
his
strongest
performance
to
date
elizabeth
warren
had
another
solid
outing
but
also
struggled
answering
direct
questions
on
her
support
for
a
medicare
for
all
single-payer
plan
bernie
sanders
had
a
raspy
throat
cory
booker
pete
buttigieg
and
beto
o'rourke
invoking
the
el
paso
shooting
punched
above
their
polling
weight
kamala
harris
vacillated
between
her
strong
first
debate
performance
when
addressing
trump
and
her
weak
second
performance
and
andrew
yang
said
he
would
start
giving
away
his
a-month
plan
to
american
families
but
if
anyone
thinks
last
night
debate
changes
the
overall
dynamics
of
this
democratic
presidential
race
they
saw
something
we
didn't
last
night
only
reinforced
what
we've
already
seen
including
at
past
debates
and
if
you're
the
trump
campaign
or
fox
news
last
night's
debate
also
reinforced
an
image
of
a
democratic
party
that's
gone
too
far
to
the
left
o'rourke
said
he
would
take
away
your
ar-
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
had
no
qualms
about
ending
private
health
insurance
in
america
i've
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
warren
said
and
pete
buttigieg
emphasized
his
plan
to
bring
immigrants
to
small
town
america
in
some
of
the
most
conservative
rural
areas
of
iowa
i
have
seen
communities
that
embraced
immigration
grow
well
guess
who
didn't
talk
about
taking
away
your
ar-
or
your
private
health
insurance
answer
joe
biden
and
if
you
want
to
know
why
he
remains
the
democratic
frontrunner
and
why
he's
viewed
as
the
most
electable
dem
by
most
voters
that's
a
big
part
of
the
reason
right
now
biden
is
dominating
the
lane
of
democratic
primary
voters
who
believe
replacing
trump
is
the
no
priority
the
most
contentious
portion
of
last
night's
debate
was
when
castro
took
on
biden
castro
the
difference
between
what
i
support
and
what
you
support
vice
president
biden
is
that
you
require
them
to
opt
in
and
i
would
not
require
them
to
opt
in
they
would
automatically
be
enrolled
biden
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
castro
you
just
said
that
you
just
said
that
two
minutes
ago
you
just
two
minutes
ago
that
they
would
have
to
buy
in
snip
castro
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
two
minutes
ago
i
mean
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
you're
forgetting
that
but
per
nbc's
mike
memoli
here's
what
biden
did
say
earlier
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
bottom
line
it
sure
looks
like
castro
got
his
attack
wrong
nbc's
benjy
sarlin
adds
that
it
appears
biden
and
castro
were
talking
past
each
other
with
castro
highlighting
a
significant
difference
in
their
plans
while
biden
was
accurate
in
describing
his
own
plan
still
talking
past
each
other
doesn't
justify
a
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said

minutes
ago

after

debate
ended
arguably
the
real
debate
began
in
the
spin
room
where
candidates
and
surrogates
tried
to
maximize
certain
parts
of
their
night
and
spin
some
other
ones
per
nbc's
gary
grumbach
and
priscilla
thompson
bernie
sanders
said
he
doesn't
believe
vice
president
joe
biden's
vote
on
the
iraq
war
is
disqualifying
but
sanders
helped
lead
the
opposition
to
what
turned
out
to
be
the
worst
foreign
policy
blunder
in
the
modern
history
of
america
during
the
debate
biden
expressed
regret
at
voting
for
the
war
andrew
yang
commented
on
the
legality
of
his
freedom
dividend
on
the
debate
stage
yang
promised
to
give
people
per
month
for
one
year
we
have
an
army
of
lawyers
who
signed
off
on
this
and
said
it
was
perfectly
legal
but
i
want
everyone
to
reflect
for
a
moment
that
we
are
at
a
point
in
time
when
a
billionaire
can
spend
million
plus
buying
his
way
onto
the
debate
stage
and
everyone
thinks
that
is
a-okay
but
then
us
literally
giving
money
to
americans
somehow
that
is
problematic
wink
wink
tom
steyer
percent
that's
the
share
of
americans
who
are
in
favor
of
a
mandatory
buyback
program
of
assault-style
weapons
according
to
an
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
almost
exactly
the
same
share
percent
are
opposed
seven-in-
democrats
favor
the
buyback
plan
but
just
percent
of
independents
and
percent
of
republicans
say
the
same
don't
miss
the
pod
from
yesterday
when
we
offered
the
good
news
that
americans
know
a
little
bit
more
about
how
the
government
works
than
they
used
to
the
bad
news
it's
still
not
that
much
miss
the
debate
here
are
the
highlights
from
our
video
team
meanwhile
the
president
had
his
own
lengthy
speech
in
baltimore
as
counter-programming
to
the
debate
dan
balz
writes
that
biden
got
the
debate
performance
he
needed
even
though
it
was
far
from
perfect
the
air
force
says
it
sent
crews
to
trump's
scotland
resort
as
many
as
times
since
boris
johnson
says
he
didn't
lie
to
the
queen
about
his
reasons
for
wanting
to
suspend
parliament
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
has
issued
a
subpoena
to
trump's
envoy
who
was
negotiating
with
the
taliban
ivanka
trump
says
she
got
her
moral
compass
from
her
dad
rudy
giuliani's
divorce
is
getting
ugly
and
public
john
lewis
may
be
close
to
announcing
support
for
impeachment
trump
says
he
wants
to
tackle
homelessness
in
california
but
the
plans
are
hitting
lots
of
snags
what's
next
for
andrew
mccabe
the
cheney
v
paul
twitter
wars
are
still
flaming
so
is
andrew
yang's
giveaway
legal
the
new
york
times
looks
at
the
new
urgency
on
the
democratic
debate
stage
is
joe
biden
still
the
frontrunner
