this
white
house

release
whistleblower
complaint
against
trump
to
congress
by
thursday
source
says
trump
has
been
under
fire
for
the
midsummer
call
after
a
whistleblower
complaint
alleged
the
president
may
have
made
inappropriate
comments
on
the
call
president
donald
trump
said
tuesday
he
had
authorized
the
release
of
the
complete
fully
declassified
and
unredacted
transcript
of
a
july
phone
call
he
had
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
that
is
at
the
center
of
questions
stemming
from
reports
that
trump
pressured
him
to
investigate
the
family
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
trump
has
been
under
fire
for
the
midsummer
call
after
a
whistleblower
complaint
alleged
that
the
president
may
have
made
inappropriate
comments
on
the
call
the
call
prompted
questions
about
whether
trump
may
have
tied
aid
to
ukraine
to
the
country's
willingness
to
investigate
business
dealings
of
biden's
son
you
will
see
it
was
a
very
friendly
and
totally
appropriate
call
no
pressure
and
unlike
joe
biden
and
his
son
no
quid
pro
quo
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
the
greatest
and
most
destructive
witch
hunt
of
all
time
trump
tweeted
the
release
of
the
transcript
by
the
white
house
isn't
likely
to
appease
democrats
who
have
demanded
that
the
administration
provide
the
whistleblower
complaint
to
congress
and
who
in
increasing
numbers
are
coming
out
in
support
of
some
form
of
impeachment
action
against
trump
house

nancy
pelosi
announced
a

afternoon

approached

for
guidance
on

intelligence
committees
the
senate
on
tuesday
voted
unanimously
on
a
nonbinding
resolution
calling
on
trump
to
release
the
whistleblower
complaint
earlier
tuesday
trump
had
confirmed
reports
that
his
administration
froze
almost
million
in
aid
to
ukraine
but
he
gave
a
new
reason
for
doing
so
he
said
he
wanted
european
countries
to
contribute
money
too
and
did
not
want
the
united
states
to
do
so
alone
as
far
as
withholding
funds
those
funds
were
paid
trump
said
they
were
fully
paid
but
my
complaint
has
always
been
and
i'd
withhold
again
and
i'll
continue
to
withhold
until
such
time
as
europe
and
other
nations
contribute
to
ukraine
because
they're
not
doing
it
very
important
i
want
other
countries
to
put
up
money
he
added
i
think
it's
unfair
that
we
put
up
the
money
then
other
people
call
me
they
said
oh
let
it
go
and
i
let
it
go
but
we
paid
the
money
the
money
was
paid
full
coverage
trump
impeachment
inquiry
he
said
he
wants
germany
france
and
other
nations
to
contribute
more
funds
and
that's
been
my
complaint
from
the
beginning
he
said
trump's
tuesday
explanation
was
a
sharp
turn
from
remarks
he
made
on
monday
tying
the
freezing
of
funds
to
ukraine's
efforts
to
combat
corruption
we
want
to
make
sure
that
country
is
honest
trump
told
reporters
on
monday
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
corruption
if
you
don't
talk
about
corruption
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
corrupt
trump's
latest
remarks
come
amid
revelations
surrounding
the
president's
apparent
push
to
have
the
ukrainian
government
investigate
biden's
son
hunter
who
had
business
dealings
in
the
country
the
late
july
discussion
between
trump
and
zelensky
has
been
scrutinized
following
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
media
reports
said
was
tied
to
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
the
administration
had
refused
to
turn
that
complaint
over
to
congress
on
monday
the
washington
post
and
other
media
outlets
reported
that
trump
instructed
his
acting
chief
of
staff
to
place
a
hold
on
about
million
in
military
aid
for
ukraine
in
the
days
before
the
late
july
phone
call
with
zelensky
the
white
house
labeled
the
reporting
as
untrue
but
in
the
weeks
before
the
existence
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
became
public
knowledge
the
trump
administration
froze
the
military
aid
to
ukraine
for
unclear
reasons
then
just
before
democrats
revealed
the
existence
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
administration
released
the
hold
on
the
aid
the
administration
put
a
hold
on
the
money
during
the
week
of
july
one
week
prior
to
trump's
phone
call
with
zelensky
two
administration
officials
told
nbc
news
tuesday
the
administration
official
who
directed
the
state
department
to
withhold
the
ukrainian
aid
was
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
according
to
a
senior
democratic
aide
briefed
last
week
by
the
state
department
the
episode
has
led
to
an
increased
impeachment
push
among
house
democrats
by
tuesday
afternoon
over
house
democrats
over
three-quarters
of
the
member
caucus
said
they
now
back
some
type
of
impeachment
action
in
light
of
the
burgeoning
ukraine
scandal
more
than
a
dozen
lawmakers
have
announced
such
support
since
the
reports
emerged
about
the
president's
conversation
with
zelensky
speaking
to
reporters
ahead
of
his
speech
to
the
u.n.
on
tuesday
trump
called
the
ratcheting
up
of
impeachment
talk
ridiculous
and
a
witch
hunt
before
insisting
that
his
call
with
zelensky
was
perfect
trump
has
admitted
to
talking
about
biden
his
political
rival
with
zelensky
but
denied
putting
any
pressure
on
the
ukrainian
leader
