had
been
a
closely
guarded
secret

complaint
by

had
no
comment
wednesday
night
about
the
report
over
the
last
several
days
the
secret
whistleblower
complaint
has
been
the
subject
of
an
increasingly
acrimonious
standoff
between
maguire
and
schiff
who
has
demanded
maguire's
testimony
and
a
copy
of
the
complaint

is
both
credible
and
urgent
schiff

released
wednesday
evening
the
committee
places
the
highest
importance
on
the
protection
of
whistleblowers
and
their
complaints
to
congress
the
matter
burst
into
public
view
friday
when
schiff
disclosed
that
an
unspecified
whistleblower
complaint
had
been
filed
with
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
but
was
being
withheld
from
his
committee
that
independent
watchdog
deemed
the
matter
an
urgent
concern
that
he
was
required
by
law
to
turn
over
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
but
maguire
after
consulting
with
the
justice
department
overruled
him
according
to
a
series
of
letters
between
a
dni
lawyer
and
schiff
that
have
been
made
public
schiff
said
that
was
illegal
and
raised
the
specter
of
a
coverup
the
dni
argued
it
was
acting
legally
jason
klitenic
the
dni
general
counsel
said
in
a
letter
to
congressional
leaders
on
tuesday
that
the
activity
covered
in
the
complaint
involves
confidential
and
potentially
privileged
communications
schiff
said
maguire
told
him
he
was
withholding
the
complaint
pursuant
to
a
higher
authority
but
the
dni
has
not
explained
whether
he
was
acting
on
orders
from
the
white
house
