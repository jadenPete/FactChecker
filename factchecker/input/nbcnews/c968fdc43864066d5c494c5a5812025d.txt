told
reporters
in

that
his
administration
will
be
adding
some
very
significant
sanctions
on
iran
within
the
next
two
days
nbc
news
reported
tuesday
that
the
administration
was
weighing
a
range
of
options
to
retaliate
against
iran
including
a
cyberattack
or
physical
strikes
u.s.
officials
briefed
on
recent
deliberations
said
military
leaders
presented
trump
with
multiple
possible
actions
in
a
national
security
meeting
monday
but
trump
asked
for
additional
choices
people
briefed
on
that
meeting
said
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
saudi
arabia
should
see
the
attack
on
its
oil
facilities
as
a
warning
to
end
the
war
in
yemen
while
insisting
the
attack
came
from
yemeni
forces
the
president
tweeted
over
the
weekend
that
the
u.s.
was
locked
and
loaded
in
preparation
for
some
sort
of
retaliatory
action
in
response
to
the
oil
field
attack
saudi
arabia
oil
supply
was
attacked
he
tweeted
sunday
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
speaking
with
reporters
in
the
oval
office
on
monday
however
trump
said
he
doesn't
want
war
with
anybody
i'm
somebody
that
would
like
not
to
have
war
he
added
saying
that
the
u.s.
has
to
sit
down
with
the
saudis
and
work
something
out
the
president
has
ratcheted
up
economic
sanctions
on
iran
after
withdrawing
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
last
year
previous
sanctions
have
targeted
iranian
oil
its
automotive
and
civil
aviation
industries
and
the
trade
of
gold
and
other
metals
while
a
number
of
gop
lawmakers
applauded
trump
for
his
decision
to
impose
further
sanctions
on
iran
other

appeared
split
sen
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
suggested
to
reporters
wednesday
that
sanctions
won't
send
a
strong
enough
message
i
am
looking
for
a
response
that
will
be
unequivocal
if
they
don't
pay
a
price
for
bombing
a
neighbor's
oil
fields
then
all
hell
is
going
to
break
loose
in
the
mideast
graham
said
i
appreciate
building
a
coalition
i
think
that's
smart
i'm
not
looking
for
a
response
immediately
but
i
am
looking
for
a
response
that
would
restore
deterrence
and
my
belief
is
that
additional
sanctions
will
fall
short
sen
mitt
romney
r-utah
meanwhile
told
reporters
wednesday
that
while
he
has
seen
intelligence
and
believes
iran
was
behind
the
attacks
on
saudi
oil
facilities
the
kingdom
must
be
the
one
to
respond
this
is
up
to
saudi
arabia
he
said
we've
been
selling
them
weapons
over
the
years
so
they're
able
to
defend
themselves
but
we're
not
the
policemen
of
the
world
and
if
iran
attacks
saudi
arabia
saudi
arabia
should
be
the
nation
that
decides
exactly
how
they're
going
to
respond
