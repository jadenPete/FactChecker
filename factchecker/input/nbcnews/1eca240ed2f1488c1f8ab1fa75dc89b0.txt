da
spar
over
release
of
trump's
tax
returns
the
case
centers
on
the
manhattan
district
attorney's
office
probe
of
trump's
involvement
in
hush-money
payments
to
two
women
claiming
affairs
with
him
a
federal
judge
on
wednesday
ordered
a
one-day
freeze
on
a
state
subpoena
seeking
eight
years
of
president
donald
trump's
personal
and
corporate
tax
returns
u.s.
district
judge
victor
marrero
issued
the
ruling
after
an
extraordinary
court
hearing
that
pitted
manhattan
district
attorney
cyrus
vance's
office
against
the
president's
attorneys
and
manhattan
federal
prosecutors
in
a
dispute
over
whether
state
officials
have
any
authority
to
bring
a
legal
action
against
a
sitting
president
vance's
prosecutors
and
the
president's
lawyers
now
have
hours
to
come
to
an
interim
agreement
over
what
information
can
be
handed
over
to
a
state
grand
jury
if
no
agreement
is
reached
the
judge
will
decide
whether
to
extend
the
deadline
or
issue
a
ruling
the
case
centers
on
vance's
attempt
to
obtain
trump's
tax
records
as
part
of
a
criminal
investigation
into
the
trump
organization
about
hush
money
payments
made
to
two
women
who
have
alleged
affairs
with
trump
before
he
became
president
the
president's
lawyers
filed
a
lawsuit
last
week
seeking
to
block
the
subpoena
the
suit
says
vance
isn't
entitled
to
the
returns
and
a
sitting
president
cannot
be
criminally
investigated
trump
also
named
his
accountant
mazars
usa
as
a
defendant
in
the
suit
as
part
of
his
bid
to
prevent
his
financial
records
from
being
turned
over
to
state
prosecutors
the
case
took
a
turn
tuesday
night
when
federal
prosecutors
filed
court
papers
saying
they
backed
trump's
effort
to
pause
the
release
of
the
tax
documents
the
manhattan
federal
prosecutors
said
the
president
has
raised
weighty
constitutional
issues
and
they
want
time
to
review
them
before
deciding
whether
to
join
the
legal
battle
during
the
wednesday
hearing
trump's
attorney
william
consovoy
argued
that
the
constitution
immunizes
the
president
from
criminal
investigations
he
said
that
if
vance
were
allowed
to
proceed
with
his
subpoena
every
state
would
have
the
green
light
to
pursue
a
case
against
the
president
this
is
untenable
said
consovoy
who
also
expressed
concerns
about
the
documents
being
leaked
solomon
shinerock
arguing
for
vance's
office
rejected
the
argument
that
the
president
cannot
be
investigated
they
have
no
authority
for
the
breathtaking
breadth
in
their
immunity
shinerock
said
the
true
risk
of
harm
here
falls
on
the
state
judicial
process
shinerock
also
resisted
the
attempt
by
federal
prosecutors
to
intervene
in
the
case
we
question
whether
they
should
be
allowed
to
appear
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
said
shinerock
who
pushed
for
a
quick
decision
given
the
ongoing
grand
jury
probe
and
concerns
over
the
statute
of
limitations
after
hearing
the
arguments
the
judge
raised
the
idea
of
a
compromise
the
handing
over
of
records
that
don't
deal
directly
with
the
president
marrero
suggested
a
model
mirroring
the
michael
cohen
case
in
which
a
magistrate
is
selected
to
review
documents
to
filter
out
those
specific
to
the
president
we
cannot
in
good
conscious
agree
to
that
said
carey
dunne
of
vance's
office
marrero
said
he'd
give
the
parties
one
day
to
see
if
they
can
resolve
their
impasse
and
agree
to
a
compromise
the
judge
also
set
monday
as
a
deadline
for
the
justice
department
to
decide
if
it
wanted
to
formally
join
the
case
vance's
office
is
probing
hush
money
payments
made
during
the
election
to
adult
film
star
stormy
daniels
and
ex-playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
both
of
whom
have
alleged
affairs
with
trump
the
president
has
denied
the
affairs
the
scope
of
the
d.a.
s
probe
is
unclear
one
of
the
d.a.
s
filings
notes
that
the
investigation
targets
new
york
conduct
and
has
yet
to
conclude
as
to
specific
charges
or
defendants
that
section
is
followed
by
two
pages
that
have
been
redacted
in
the
public
filing
to
date
the
filings
say
the
trump
organization
has
provided
responsive
pages
already
to
the
d.a.
s
subpoenas
and
inquiries
into
the
hush
money
payments
but
no
tax
records
