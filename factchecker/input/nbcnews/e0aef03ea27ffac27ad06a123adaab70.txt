this
is
america
ready
for
an
year-old
commander
in
chief
analysis
the
age
issue
hits
close
to
home
for
biden
whose
shaky
debate
performances
have
raised
questions
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
was
open
and
it
was
the
vice
president's
turn
at
long
last
his
loyalty
to
the
administration
was
unquestionable
his
credentials
were
unimpeachable
and
his
politics
aligned
with
the
dominant
forces
within
the
party
there
was
no
glaring
reason
for
democrats
not
to
turn
to
him
except
for
this
he
was
old
this
was
in
more
than
a
half-century
ago
when
alben
w.
barkley
harry's
truman's
year-old
vice
president
came
to
the
chicago
convention
convinced
that
his
moment
at
the
top
of
the
ticket
was
finally
at
hand
only
to
be
greeted
by
union
leaders
who
had
the
power
to
thwart
him
and
who'd
decided
to
do
just
that
we
can't
sell
barkley
to
labor
one
of
them
announced
not
because
of
his
record
but
because
of
his
age
and
that
was
that
lashing
out
at
certain
self-appointed
political
labor
leaders
barkley
withdrew
from
the
race
and
gave
up
his
dream
two
years
later
intent
on
disproving
the
notion
that
he
was
too
frail
for
national
politics
barkley
won
back
his
old
senate
seat
from
kentucky
but
he
soon
suffered
a
fatal
heart
attack
while
delivering
a
speech
his
death
came
nearly
a
year
before
his
term
as
president
would
have
ended
when
it
comes
to
serving
as
president
the
constitution
sets
only
a
minimum
age
not
a
maximum
one
but
barkley
was
butting
up
against
a
notion
that
prevailed
until
recently
in
american
history
that
there
was
an
informal
limit
on
how
old
a
president
could
be
and
that
it
was
roughly
speaking
the
late
s
this
had
something
to
do
with
life
expectancy
and
with
the
widespread
adoption
by
the
early
th
century
of
as
a
standard
retirement
age
there
was
also
the
cautionary
case
of
william
henry
harrison
who
was
years
and
days
old
when
he
was
inaugurated
as
president
in
march
and
years
and
days
old
when
he
died
a
month
later
the
three
septuagenarian
democrats
now
running
bernie
sanders
joe
biden
and
elizabeth
warren
and
the
current
year-old
occupant
of
the
white
house
all
demonstrate
that
it's
no
longer
remarkable
for
someone
over
to
seek
the
presidency
or
even
to
win
it
clearly
that
old
informal
age
cap
has
been
raised
but
just
how
high
remains
unclear
and
it
looms
as
a
potentially
crucial
variable
as
democrats
choose
their
nominee
the
standards
changed
because
of
the
election
ronald
reagan
was
the
next-in-line
republican
candidate
the
runner-up
in
the
nomination
fight
that
went
all
the
way
to
the
convention
but
he
was
also
approaching
his
th
birthday
a
number
that
was
still
thought
to
be
prohibitive
when
it
came
to
launching
a
campaign
columnists
roland
evans
and
robert
novak
declared
him
by
an
objective
reckoning
too
old
to
run
for
president
again
reagan
went
ahead
and
ran
anyway
and
questions
about
his
age
featured
prominently
in
the
campaign
at
one
point
year-old
sen
gaylord
nelson
a
wisconsin
democrat
announced
that
reagan
had
inspired
him
to
make
his
own
re-election
campaign
in
his
last
if
i
am
elected
and
serve
out
my
term
nelson
said
i
would
be
as
old
as
reagan
is
now
and
that's
too
old
to
run
it
was
the
growing
power
of
television
that
allowed
reagan
a
trained
actor
to
assuage
these
fears
with
command
performances
in
highly
visible
moments
there
was
the
republican
primary
debate
where
he
dusted
off
an
old
movie
line
i
am
paying
for
this
microphone
to
turn
the
new
hampshire
race
in
his
favor
and
there
was
his
single
showdown
with
president
jimmy
carter
when
reagan
used
a
pair
of
devastating
lines
there
you
go
again
and
are
you
better
off
today
than
you
were
four
years
ago
to
transform
a
close
contest
into
a
landslide
critics
said
he
was
mangling
facts
but
the
reagan
that
millions
of
americans
encountered
in
was
sharp
confident
and
quick-witted
four
years
later
running
for
re-election
at
age
reagan's
lead
over
democrat
walter
mondale
was
briefly
threatened
when
he
appeared
confused
during
an
october
debate
and
gave
a
series
of
halting
and
meandering
responses
with
the
country
watching
closely
in
the
next
debate
reagan
returned
to
his
form
and
famously
defused
the
matter
of
age
with
a
joke
about
not
making
an
issue
of
his
year-old
opponent's
youth
and
inexperience
the
reagan
years
hardly
ended
the
debate
over
age
and
the
presidency
his
second
term
produced
further
concerns
about
possible
mental
decline
and
later
after
he
left
the
white
house
came
his
alzheimer's
diagnosis
nonetheless
reagan
remained
in
office
for
two
full
terms
and
departed
just
short
of
years
old
with
strong
popularity
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
age
his
presidency
absolutely
shifted
the
goal
posts
since
reagan
three
more
septuagenarians
have
been
nominated
for
president
year-old
bob
dole
in
year-old
john
mccain
in
and
year-old
donald
trump
in
there
was
also
year-old
george
h.w.
bush
in
and
year-old
hillary
clinton
in
both
would
have
governed
as
septuagenarians
had
they
won
now
there's
the
possibility
that
in
both
parties
will
field
candidates
who
are
something
but
this
campaign
may
still
test
limits
a
recent
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
found
that
more
than
six
in
americans
say
they'd
have
reservations
about
a
candidate
over
years
old
neither
party
has
yet
nominated
someone
that
old
but
both
biden
and
sanders
are
past
that
threshold
assuming
good
health
they'd
each
reach
in
a
first
term
uncharted
territory
for
a
commander
in
chief
will
this
matter
to
voters
jimmy
carter
said
this
week
he
hoped
there
would
be
an
age
limit
for
the
presidency
and
confessed
he
couldn't
have
done
the
job
at
the
question
is
particularly
key
when
it
comes
to
biden
the
democratic
front-runner
on
policy
he's
largely
in
line
with
today's
democratic
orthodoxy
and
polls
continue
to
show
him
outpacing
his
rivals
in
match-ups
against
trump
in
many
ways
he's
the
logical
heir
to
his
party's
nomination
but
in
the
most
widely
seen
moments
of
the
campaign
the
televised
debates
biden
has
so
far
delivered
shaky
performances
that
have
aroused
concerns
about
whether
his
age
is
showing
too
much
the
example
of
reagan
is
worth
returning
to
here
because
he
excelled
when
the
spotlight
was
brightest
he
could
convince
voters
that
his
age
didn't
matter
if
biden
continues
to
struggle
in
the
spotlight
he
risks
voters
deciding
that
his
age
does
