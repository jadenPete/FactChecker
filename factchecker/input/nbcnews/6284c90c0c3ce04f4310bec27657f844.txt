new

city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
race
friday
ending
a
long
shot
bid
for
the
democratic
nomination
that
never
went
anywhere
i
feel
like
i
have
contributed
all
i
can
to
this
primary
election
and
it's
clearly
not
my
time
so
i'm
going
to
end
my
presidential
campaign

said
in
an
interview
on
msnbc's
morning
joe
we
have
a
chance
to
get
it
right
in
de
blasio
added
whoever
our
nominee
is
let's
make
sure
we're
talking
to
the
hearts
of
working
people
de
blasio
said
he
would
not
be
endorsing
any
of
his
fellow
candidates
today
but
that
he
would
think
about
doing
so
in
the
future
he
added
that
he
would
of
course
support
whoever
the
eventual
nominee
is
in
a
piece
for

news
think
de
blasio
explained
that
he
would
continue
fighting
for
working
people
and
ensuring
that
new
york
city
remains
the
vanguard
of
progressivism
will
continue
to
be
my
missions
president
donald
trump
a
frequent
critic
of
de
blasio
immediately
chimed
in
jeering
in
a
post
on
twitter
that
the
exit
from
the
race
by
the
part
time
mayor
was
big
political
news
perhaps
the
biggest
story
in
years
and
that
nyc
is
devastated
that
he's
coming
home
de
blasio's
bid
launched
in
may
ultimately
lasted
just
over
four
months
and
was
largely
mocked
for
most
of
its
short
life
he
was
widely
unpopular
in
new
york
city
with
an
april
quinnipiac
poll
showing
that
more
than
three-quarters
of
new
yorkers
felt
he
shouldn't
run
and
faced
a
stiff
upward
climb
in
a
crowded
field
of
democratic
candidates
download
the
nbc

app
for

and
politics
de
blasio
had
attempted
to
run
on
a
record
of
progressive
accomplishments
including
enacting
universal
pre-kindergarten
and
helping
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
an
hour
but
his
campaign
never
took
off
a
slew
of
national
polls
showed
him
stuck
with
just
percent
support
and
often
times
even
less
a
siena
college
poll
released
earlier
this
week
showed
him
with
percent
even
in
new
york
city
de
blasio
failed
to
qualify
for
the
democratic
debate
earlier
this
month
and
was
all
but
certain
to
fail
to
qualify
for
the
one
scheduled
for
october
his
brief
campaign
was
marred
with
sparsely
attended
events
and
a
bevy
of
unforced
errors
he
made
headlines
in
august
after
an
event
in
iowa
drew
only
about
people
de
blasio
attempted
to
use
twitter
to
brand
trump
as
condon
but
that
too
drew
mockery
because
it
means
condom
in
spanish
and
he
continued
earning
the
scorn
of
his
fellow
new
yorkers
for
being
on
the
campaign
trail
during
crises
in
new
york
city
including
a
widespread
power
outage
in
july
even
his
entrance
into
the
race
in
may
was
bogged
down
with
challenges
a
missouri
teenager
stole
the
spotlight
from
his
campaign
when
he
scooped
the
new
york
city
mayor's
announcement
in
dropping
out
