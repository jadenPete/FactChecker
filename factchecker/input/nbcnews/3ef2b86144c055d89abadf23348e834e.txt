guns
the
disputes
at
the
third

were
too
much
for
pete

who
said
the
event
was
unwatchable
for
voters
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
clashed
with
joe
biden
on
health
care
at
the
third
presidential
debate
thursday
as
lower-profile
candidates
tried
to
knock
the
front-runner
from
his
perch
the
former
vice
president
said
the
progressive
senators
are
turning
their
back
on
the
legacy
of
former
president
barack
obama
by
wanting
to
replace
the
affordable
care
act
with
a
single-payer
medicare
for
all
plan
i
know
the
senator
says
she's
for
bernie
well
i'm
for
barack
biden
said
of
warren
at
the
start
of
the
debate
while
adding
that
sanders
wasn't
being
honest
about
how
he
would
pay
for
his
plan
it
was
the
first
time
the
leading
candidates
appeared
on
stage
together
after
two
earlier
debates
this
summer
that
had
to
be
held
over
two
nights
to
accommodate
all
candidates
those
events
did
little
to
dislodge
biden
from
the
top
of
the
polls
but
the
large
field
of
candidates
has
begun
to
winnow
and
voters
are
increasingly
tuning
in
to
the
race
so
challengers
hoped
to
shake
things
up
in
houston
at
the
abc-sponsored
debate
the
front-runners
biden
sanders
and
warren
approached
the
third
debate
more
cautiously
not
wanting
to
risk
their
position
leaving
room
for
other
candidates
to
step
forward
and
they
showed
little
deference
to
the
former
vice
president
meanwhile
president
donald
trump
speaking
to
republican
lawmakers
in
baltimore
said
he
had
attacked
warren
too
early
in
the
process
i
thought
she
was
gone
the
president
said
she's
emerged
from
the
ashes
and
now
it
looks
like
she
could
beat
sleepy
joe
former
housing
secretary
juli
n
castro
attacked
biden
personally
suggesting
the
year-old
was
losing
his
memory
and
forgetting
what
he
had
just
said
moments
earlier
and
he
argued
a
young
person
of
color
like
him
is
the
true
heir
of
the
obama
legacy
i'm
fulfilling
the
legacy
of
barack
obama
and
you're
not
castro
said
to
mixed
reaction
from
the
crowd
he
wants
to
take
credit
for
obama's
work
without
having
to
answer
any
questions
others
tried
to
interject
and
urge
unity
with
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
indiana
warning
the
debate
was
becoming
unwatchable
because
of
the
arguing
and
attacks
that's
called
an
election
castro
shot
back
the
candidates
had
a
more
substantive
discussion
on
guns
health
care
and
foreign
policy
sanders
whose
voice
was
noticeably
hoarse
launched
a
fervent
if
familiar
defense
of
medicare
for
all
while
warren
tried
to
thread
the
needle
by
saying
her
plan
is
the
best
way
to
expand
obamacare
we
all
owe
a
huge
debt
to
obama
warren
said
arguing
people
wouldn't
miss
their
insurer
i've
never
actually
met
anybody
who
likes
their
insurance
company
i've
met
people
who
like
their
doctor
the
only
difference
here
is
where
to
send
the
bill
the
rest
of
the
stage
including
california
sen
kamala
harris
who
has
supported
medicare
for
all
warned
sanders
and
warren's
plan
would
kick
over
million
americans
off
their
health
insurance
plans
in
favor
of
a
government-run
program
buttigieg
called
that
plan
my
way
or
the
highway
and
said
sanders
and
warren
don't
trust
the
american
people
on
guns
several
candidates
suggested
biden's
approach
was
too
cautious
hey
joe
instead
of
saying
no
we
can't
let's
say
yes
we
can
harris
said
quoting
obama's
campaign
slogan
biden
said
he
was
the
only
candidate
on
stage
to
have
beaten
the
national
rifle
association
referring
to
the
passage
of
the
assault
weapon
ban
in
but
said
the
executive
action
that
harris
and
others
favor
would
not
stand
up
in
court
after
weaker
performances
in
the
past
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
stood
out
on
guns
and
received
praise
from
his
rivals
for
his
conduct
after
a
mass
shooting
this
summer
in
his
native
el
paso
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
o'rourke
said
to
cheers
of
his
mandatory
gun
buyback
plan
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
them
to
be
used
against
other
americans
anymore
but
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
suggested
o'rourke
was
late
to
the
issue
and
embraced
programs
that
booker
champions
like
national
gun
licensing
only
after
violence
touched
his
hometown
it
is
time
for
a
movement
on
this
issue
and
i
will
lead
it
booker
said
later
sanders
and
biden
sparred
briefly
on
foreign
policy
after
biden
acknowledged
that
he
never
should
have
voted
to
give
president
george
w.
bush
authority
to
invade
iraq
but
sanders
said
that
hindsight
wasn't
good
enough
one
of
the
big
differences
between
you
and
me
i
never
believed
what
cheney
and
bush
said
sanders
replied
i
voted
against
the
war
in
iraq
and
helped
lead
the
opposition
otherwise
the
candidates
rarely
attacked
one
another
and
mostly
used
the
stage
as
a
platform
to
promote
their
own
plans
and
deliver
their
own
talking
points
and
jokes
harris
said
trump
was
like
the
wizard
of
oz
because
when
you
pull
back
the
curtain
it's
a
really
small
dude
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
who
announced
onstage
that
he
would
be
giving
away
a
month
to
random
people
for
a
year
as
a
pilot
of
his
universal
basic
income
plan
quipped
that
he
understands
health
care
because
i'm
asian
so
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
and
klobuchar
warned
about
the
danger
of
climate
change
by
saying
you
know
that
movie
the
day
after
tomorrow
it's
today
eight
other
candidates
did
not
qualify
for
this
debate
but
will
have
another
shot
to
make
the
one
next
month
in
ohio
