trump
administration
set
to
end
california's
ability
to
regulate
auto
emissions
the
move
comes
after
the
justice
department
opened
an
antitrust
investigation
into
a

standards
washington
the
trump
administration
is
poised
to
revoke
california's
authority
to
set
auto
mileage
standards
asserting
that
only
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
fuel
economy
conservative
and
free-market
groups
have
been
asked
to
attend
a
formal
announcement
of
the
rollback
set
for
wednesday
afternoon
at
environmental
protection
agency
headquarters
in
washington
gloria
bergquist
spokeswoman
for
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
said
tuesday
that
her
group
was
among
those
invited
to
the
event
featuring
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
and
transportation
secretary
elaine
chao
the
move
comes
after
the
justice
department
recently
opened
an
antitrust
investigation
into
a
deal
between
california
and
four
automakers
for
tougher
pollution
and
related
mileage
requirements
than
those
sought
by
president
donald
trump
trump
also
has
sought
to
relax
obama-era
federal
mileage
standards
nationwide
weakening
a
key
effort
by
his
democratic
predecessor
to
slow
climate
change
top
california
officials
and
environmental
groups
pledged
legal
action
to
stop
the
rollback
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
tuesday
referring
questions
to
epa
epa's
press
office
did
not
respond
to
a
phone
message
and
email
seeking
comment
but
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
told
the
national
automobile
dealers
association
on
tuesday
that
the
trump
administration
would
move
in
the
very
near
future
to
take
steps
toward
establishing
one
nationwide
set
of
fuel-economy
standards
we
embrace
federalism
and
the
role
of
the
states
but
federalism
does
not
mean
that
one
state
can
dictate
standards
for
the
nation
he
said
adding
that
higher
fuel
economy
standards
would
hurt
consumers
by
increasing
the
average
sticker
price
of
new
cars
and
requiring
automakers
to
produce
more
electric
vehicles
word
of
the
pending
announcement
came
as
trump
traveled
to
california
on
tuesday
for
an
overnight
trip
that
includes
gop
fundraising
events
near
san
francisco
los
angeles
and
san
diego
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
tougher
emissions
standards
goes
back
to
a
waiver
issued
by
congress
during
passage
of
the
clean
air
act
in
the
state
has
long
pushed
automakers
to
adopt
more
fuel-efficient
passenger
vehicles
that
emit
less
pollution
a
dozen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
also
follow
california's
fuel
economy
standards
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
tuesday
that
the
trump
administration's
action
will
hurt
both
u.s.
automakers
and
american
families
he
said
california
would
fight
the
administration
in
federal
court
you
have
no
basis
and
no
authority
to
pull
this
waiver
becerra
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
trump
we're
ready
to
fight
for
a
future
that
you
seem
unable
to
comprehend
california
gov
gavin
newsom
said
the
white
house
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
the
rest
of
the
world
on
cutting
emissions
and
fighting
global
warming
california
won't
ever
wait
for
permission
from
washington
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
children
and
families
said
newsom
a
democrat
the
deal
struck
in
july
between
california
and
four
of
the
world's
largest
automakers
ford
honda
bmw
and
volkswagen
bypassed
the
trump
administration's
plan
to
freeze
emissions
and
fuel
economy
standards
adopted
under
obama
at
levels
the
four
automakers
agreed
with
california
to
reduce
emissions
by
per
year
starting
with
the
model
year
through
that
compares
with
yearly
reductions
through
under
the
obama
standards
emissions
standards
are
closely
linked
with
fuel
economy
requirements
because
vehicles
pollute
less
if
they
burn
fewer
gallons
of
fuel
the
u.s.
transportation
sector
is
the
nation's
biggest
single
source
of
planet-warming
greenhouse
gasses
wheeler
said
tuesday
california
will
be
able
to
keep
in
place
and
enforce
programs
to
address
smog
and
other
forms
of
air
pollution
caused
by
motor
vehicles
but
fuel
economy
has
been
one
of
the
key
regulatory
tools
the
state
has
used
to
reduce
harmful
emissions
environmentalists
condemned
the
trump
administration's
expected
announcement
everyone
wins
when
we
adopt
strong
clean
car
standards
as
our
public
policy
said
fred
krupp
president
of
environmental
defense
fund
strong
clean
car
standards
give
us
healthier
air
to
breathe
help
protect
us
from
the
urgent
threat
of
climate
change
and
save
americans
hundreds
of
dollars
a
year
in
