this
house
passes
million
bill
requiring
carbon
monoxide
detectors
in
public
housing
an
nbc
news
investigation
found
that
at
least
public
housing
residents
have
died
from
carbon
monoxide
poisoning
since
the
house
passed
a
bill
tuesday
requiring
carbon
monoxide
detectors
in
public
housing
after
more
than
a
dozen
tenants
died
from
the
gas
in
the
last
years
it
will
prevent
tragic
and
completely
needless
deaths
said
rep
jes
s
chuy
garc
a
d-ill
the
lead
sponsor
of
the
bill
which
provides
about
million
over
three
years
to
install
carbon
monoxide
detectors
in
federally
subsidized
housing
for
poor
families
this
is
a
bill
that
will
save
lives
and
help
make
us
all
safer
rep
steve
stivers
r-ohio
said
a
similar
proposal
has
been
introduced
in
the
senate
the
bill
follows
an
nbc
news
investigation
that
exposed
the
lack
of
protections
for
millions
of
low-income
families
living
in
federally
subsidized
housing
since
at
least
public
housing
residents
have
died
from
carbon
monoxide
poisoning
with
four
deaths
this
year
alone
nbc
news
found
the
gas
is
odorless
colorless
and
tasteless
so
public
health
experts
strongly
recommend
installing
detectors
to
protect
residents
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
however
does
not
require
detectors
in
federally
subsidized
properties
that
it
supervises
for
more
than
million
poor
families
despite
its
mandate
to
ensure
that
all
public
housing
is
decent
safe
and
sanitary
it
is
unconscionable
that
the
very
people
our
government
seeks
to
provide
shelter
for
are
dying
in
their
homes
garc
a
said
tuesday
on
the
house
floor
following
nbc
news
reporting
hud
secretary
ben
carson
announced
that
the
agency
would
propose
a
new
rule
to
require
co
detectors
but
the
rule-making
process
is
time-consuming
and
the
department
said
it
would
be
able
to
act
more
quickly
if
congress
passed
a
law
requiring
detectors
the
bill
also
requires
detectors
in
rural
rental
properties
overseen
by
the
department
of
agriculture
the
house
bill
has
attracted
support
from
industry
groups
that
initially
raised
concerns
about
the
cost
of
installing
new
detectors
the
proposal
takes
a
thoughtful
and
evenhanded
approach
to
tackle
preventable
deaths

of
congressional
relations
for
the

sens
tim
scott
r-s
c.
and
bob
menendez
d-n
j.
have
introduced
a
similar
bipartisan
proposal
in
the
senate
to
require
detectors
that
has
yet
to
advance
though
aides
said
they
were
hopeful
it
would
move
forward
soon
scott
who
worked
closely
with
hud
staff
on
the
bill
called
the
legislation
a
top
priority
to
ensure
the
safety
of
all
families
moving
forward
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
who
introduced
an
earlier
bill
requiring
detectors
called
on
the
senate
to
act
quickly
right
now
too
many
vulnerable
families
across
the
country
are
living
without
carbon
monoxide
detectors
in
their
homes
needlessly
putting
lives
at
risk
harris
said
in
a
statement
hud
has
also
been
supportive
of
the
legislative
effort
in
congress
as
the
secretary
has
said
many
times
any
death
is
one
too
many
a
hud
spokesperson
said
in
a
statement
we've
got
to
get
this
done
