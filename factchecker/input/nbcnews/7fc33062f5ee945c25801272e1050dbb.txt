this
there's
good
news
and
bad
news
for
the
gop
after
a
narrow
north
carolina
win
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
the
last
race
of
pretty
much
played
out
the
way
the
other
ones
did
the
last
cycle
especially
when
it
comes
to
special
elections
the
good
news
for
the
gop
they
won
last
night's
special
election
in
north
carolina's
ninth
district
with
republican
dan
bishop
narrowly
defeating
democrat
dan
mccready
percent
to
percent
that
keeps
the
magic
number
of
seats
they
need
to
flip
to
win
back
the
chamber
in
at
a
net
of
instead
of
raising
it
to
it
also
means
republicans
won't
have
to
spend
the
same
kind
of
resources
next
november
to
defeat
mccready
which
would
have
been
a
definite
target
that
money
can
now
go
elsewhere
the
bad
news
they
barely
won
a
district
that
both
donald
trump
and
mitt
romney
carried
by
points
suggesting
at
least
for
this
one
special
that
the
overall
political
environment
hasn't
changed
much
since
indeed
the
cook
political
report
identifies
more
than
gop-held
house
seats
that
are
less
friendly
to
republicans
than
nc-
per
nbc's
ed
demaria
they
include
tx-
the
open
will
hurd
seat
pa-
brian
fitzpatrick
mi-
fred
upton
ne-
don
bacon
il-
mike
bost
oh-
steve
chabot
and
fl-
vern
buchanan
speaking
of
a
political
environment
that
hasn't
changed
that
much
since
last
november
three
new
national
polls
all
have
trump's
job
rating
below
percent
so
nearly
a
year
after
the
midterms
the
president's
approval
rating
is
still
stuck
in
pretty
much
the
same
place
democrats
are
making
more
and
more
races
competitive
but
the
bottom
still
hasn't
fallen
out
for
the
gop
and
in
districts
with
just
enough
trump
supporters
the
president
can
still
show
up
for
a
rally
and
make
the
difference
the
question
for
the
gop
is
of
course
whether
there
are
enough
of
those
trump-friendly
areas
in
by
the
way
this
unchanged
political
environment
is
bad
news
for
backers
of
new
gun
legislation
too
without
a
jarring
loss
in
nc-
there's
no
reason
to
think
republicans
will
have
any
incentive
to
make
policy
concessions
on
guns
or
anything
else
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
is
out
after
a
series
of
disagreements
with
trump
most
recently
over
potential
negotiations
with
the
taliban
at
camp
david
bolton
is
the
fourth
person
to
hold
the
job
during
the
president's
tenure
he
served
just
days
per
foreign
policy
which
still
made
him
the
longest-tenured
official
in
the
position
during
the
trump
administration
michael
flynn
held
it
for
just
days
before
stepping
down
and
later
pleading
guilty
to
lying
to
the
fbi
h.r.
mcmaster
was
in
the
job
for
days
and
keith
kellogg
briefly
served
as
acting
nsa
for
seven
days
trump
has
tried
to
make
the
case
that
the
constant
churn
is
shaking
things
up
but
does
he
have
anything
to
show
for
it
especially
on
foreign
policy
other
than
the
public
dismissal
of
people
he
hired
as
our
colleague
benjy
sarlin
points
out
there's
no
one
reason
why
trump's
approval
isn't
great
but
everyone
i
hire
ends
up
being
an
incompetent
loser
who
betrays
me
continues
to
be
an
interesting
choice
of
re-election
theme
percent
versus
percent
that's
democrat
dan
mccready's
margin
of
victory
in
north
carolina's
robeson
county
in
the
election
and
the
special
election
redo
respectively
robeson
is
a
majority-minority
county
due
in
part
to
about
percent
of
residents
who
identify
as
native
american
black
residents
make
up
another
percent
and
but
it's
worth
noting
that
the
turnout
in
the
special
election
was
far
lower
by
nearly
votes
in
robeson
county
alone
compared
with
by
the
way
trump
won
robeson
in
by
points

asked
how

plans
to

if
she
plans

take

directly
during

debate
on
thursday
instead

pivoted
