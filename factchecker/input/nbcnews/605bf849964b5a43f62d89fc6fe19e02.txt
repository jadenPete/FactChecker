this
is
andrew
yang
ready
for
prime
time
the
crowds
are
bigger
the
energy
is
higher
yang
told
nbc
news
the
questions
are
more
about
what
you
would
do
as
president
gene
bishop
said
his
father
a
life-long
republican
is
turning
over
in
his
grave
right
now
over
his
steadfast
support
of
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
diane
kendall
herself
a
longtime
republican
said
she's
never
been
so
excited
for
a
candidate
as
she
is
now
for
a
democrat
bishop
a
new
hampshire
retiree
and
kendall
a
new
hampshire
administrator
have
fallen
for
the
same
contender
andrew
yang
an
entrepreneur
and
son
of
taiwanese
immigrants
yang
began
his
presidential
campaign
in
to
little
fanfare
but
made
a
name
for
himself
by
promising
to
give
every
american
adult
a
month
he's
an
intellectual
bishop
told
nbc
news
he's
not
a
politician
he
has
fantastic
insight
into
how
to
solve
today
and
tomorrow's
problems
he's
the
best
out
there
to
me
hands
down
yang
is
one
of
the
top
six
polling
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
field
heading
into
thursday's
abc
debate
behind
former
vice
president
joe
biden
sens
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
kamala
harris
of
california
and
mayor
pete
buttigieg
south
bend
indiana
one
of
the
lesser-known
candidates
yang
still
faces
long
odds
his
fortunes
changed
drastically
over
the
past
few
months
though
he
began
the
year
being
left
out
of
some
democratic
primary
polls
and
is
now
regularly
polling
ahead
of
sitting
senators
congressman
and
governors
the
crowds
are
bigger
the
energy
is
higher
yang
told
nbc
news
in
a
recent
interview
over
twitter
the
questions
are
more
about
what
you
would
do
as
president
the
growth
makes
everything
on
the
trail
feel
more
vital
and
exuberant
these
recent
days
have
been
the
best
yet
and
we
are
continuing
to
grow
yang
has
locked
himself
into
not
only
thursday's
debate
but
october's
as
well
after
meeting
both
polling
and
fundraising
requirements
while
yang
only
narrowly
leads
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
of
texas
and
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
in
the
polls
his
candidacy
has
outpaced
both
of
theirs
o'rourke
entered
the
race
with
much
fanfare
only
to
see
his
numbers
evaporate
and
booker
has
struggled
to
take
off
though
he
opposes
president
donald
trump
yang
credits
the
president
for
tapping
into
the
economic
insecurity
that
ripples
through
the
country
yang's
worldview
can
be
described
as
dystopian
one
in
which
the
country
is
past
the
point
of
no
return
on
issues
like
climate
change
and
automation
this
darker
view
calls
for
dealing
with
the
issues
existing
in
this
dystopia
rather
than
offering
policies
in
hope
of
averting
them
yang
has
cultivated
a
rabid
online
fan
base
and
his
events
are
flooded
with
supporters
clad
in
math
hats
and
signs
standing
for
make
america
think
harder
he
cracks
jokes
both
to
his
online
following
through
his
ever-frequent
tweeting
and
at
his
events
this
is
a
candidate
who
went
viral
this
week
for
crowdsurfing
and
last
month
for
doing
the
cupid
shuffle
i
think
things
like
andrew
yang
not
wearing
a
tie
to
the
debate
had
some
people
start
noticing
him
i
think
when
he
talks
like
a
real
person
he
gets
people
to
notice
him
rebecca
katz
a
democratic
strategist
told
nbc
news
especially
when
he's
on
the
stage
with
nine
other
politicians
and
he
talks
in
real
people
terms
i
think
that
resonates
with
folks
for
yang
the
question
now
isn't
how
he
can
keep
the
likes
of
o'rourke
and
booker
at
bay
it's
how
he
can
undertake
the
much
more
monumental
task
of
breaking
into
the
seemingly
unmovable
upper-ranks
of
the
primary
race
and
if
he's
willing
to
adapt
or
make
changes
needed
to
do
so
katz
said
to
keep
progressing
in
the
field
where
he
currently
trails
buttigieg
and
harris
by
a
handful
of
percentage
points
yang
needs
to
keep
creating
moments
that
separate
him
from
the
field
andrew
yang's
challenge
is
to
do
things
that
make
him
seem
reasonable
without
seeming
like
a
politician
she
said
and
that's
how
he
gets
noticed
steve
marchand
a
senior
adviser
to
the
yang
campaign
said
he's
seen
yang
grow
into
his
candidacy
as
the
primary
contest
has
dragged
along
every
day
is
a
lesson
for
someone
who
has
never
run
for
public
office
before
marchand
added
pointing
to
yang's
improvement
from
the
june
debate
to
his
july
effort
which
the
campaign
credits
with
a
boost
in
enthusiasm
and
support
as
yang
told
nbc
news
i've
learned
a
lot
on
the
trail
i've
found
that
the
more
i
lean
into
what
makes
me
human
the
more
people
respond
he
said
this
campaign
has
been
on
some
level
an
exploration
of
my
own
humanity
as
one
new
hampshire
supporter
sam
hayden
told
nbc
news
last
month
seeing
how
yang
interacts
with
crowds
and
how
genuine
he
seems
to
be
as
an
individual
has
absolutely
motivated
me
to
come
out
and
support
as
much
as
i
can
marchand
said
that
observers
can
expect
to
see
the
campaign
mature
more
in
the
months
ahead
though
yang
gained
notice
for
posting
dozens
upon
dozens
of
obscure
policies
on
his
website
in
the
early
stages
of
his
campaign
his
most
recent
policy
roll-out
was
more
traditional
last
month
yang
presented
his
climate
plan
in
front
of
a
picturesque
portsmouth
new
hampshire
background
with
media
and
supporters
present
it
was
the
first
time
that
we
had
rolled
out
a
plan
on
a
policy
point
like
that
marchand
said
adding
what
you're
going
to
find
in
the
weeks
to
come
is
that
we're
going
to
be
consolidating
some
of
these
ideas
some
of
these
policies
that
are
thematically
similar
economics
health
care
education
climate
and
so
forth
foreign
policy
and
consolidating
them
and
expanding
upon
them
so
as
to
make
them
more
thematically
pure
so
that
will
look
different
but
it'll
be
deeper
and
will
probably
be
more
cohesive
in
terms
of
how
all
these
policies
fits
together
he
continued
yang
and
his
followers
frequently
lament
the
lack
of
media
attention
his
candidacy
has
received
with
the
candidate
often
highlighting
cable
news
packages
involving
the
democratic
primary
field
that
exclude
him
but
with
more
media
attention
comes
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
both
of
his
ideas
and
his
business
background
as
a
curiosity
candidate
yang
didn't
face
much
scrutiny
katz
said
but
she
said
that's
about
to
change
he
could
just
kind
of
skate
around
on
the
edges
she
said
but
now
he's
making
it
onto
the
big
debate
stage
he's
making
it
over
many
more
qualified
elected
officials
and
now
it's
his
time
to
answer
some
of
the
hard
questions
with
regard
to
yang's
career
before
politics
reports
have
highlighted
how
the
nonprofit
yang
founded
and
led
for
much
of
the
past
decade
has
fallen
short
of
its
goals
within
the
past
month
yang
also
faced
scrutiny
over
paid
speeches
he
made
while
a
presidential
candidate
yang's
plan
to
provide
a
universal
basic
income
which
he
would
pay
for
by
creating
what
amounts
to
a
tax
on
the
gains
of
automation
has
received
a
healthy
dose
of
skepticism
and
the
environmental
group
greenpeace
gave
his
climate
change
platform
which
includes
a
section
titled
move
to
higher
ground
the
lowest
score
of
the
candidates
it
graded
they
just
need
to
flesh
out
his
issues
more
katz
said
i
think
from
what
i
can
tell
his
position
on
climate
is
terrible
we're
all
going
to
die
so
let's
move
to
higher
land
i
think
some
of
these
ideas
that
might
have
gotten
a
laugh
or
gotten
folks
a
little
bit
intrigued
will
now
get
some
tougher
pushback
yang
says
he's
prepared
for
pushback
i
ran
a
nonprofit
for
seven
years
that
helped
create
thousands
of
jobs
and
had
to
file
its
numbers
every
year
he
said
i
live
a
pretty
boring
life
i
would
be
thrilled
for
more
attention
to
be
paid
to
my
ideas
because
people
would
see
how
positive
an
impact
they
would
have
on
our
day-to-day
lives
that
is
the
point
of
this
campaign
his
supporters
are
even
more
sure
he
can
take
it
jay
delarosa
a
student
from
new
york
city
told
nbc
news
bring
it
on
we
would
love
it
he
is
bulletproof
you
can't
stump
the
guy
yang's
appearance
in
thursday's
third
debate
is
his
best
opportunity
yet
to
break
through
as
for
the
first
time
he
shares
a
stage
with
each
of
the
candidates
he
is
trying
to
chase
down
yang
called
it
a
great
opportunity
to
give
more
americans
a
sense
of
my
campaign
and
how
we
can
improve
our
own
lives
it's
also
a
great
chance
to
convey
a
sense
of
how
i
compare
to
the
top
contenders
since
we
will
all
be
on
stage
he
added
i
think
that
my
vision
for
the
country
compares
favorably
to
that
of
other
candidates
