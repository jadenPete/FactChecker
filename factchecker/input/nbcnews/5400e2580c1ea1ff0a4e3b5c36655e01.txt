brought
out
another
favored
trail
nickname
for
a
democratic
rival
calling
sen

sanders
i-vt
crazy
bernie
and
mocked
the
pronunciation
of

repeatedly
saying
boot-edge-edge
the

seemingly
trying
to
imitate
the
chinese
leader
and
here's
sleepy
joe
wha
where
am
i
where
am
i
he
said
trying
to
imitate
biden
trump
said
xi
would
then
say
just
sign
here
sleepy
joe
he
said
the
president
again
suggested
that
his
record
on
the
economy
would
be
his
ticket
to
another
term
in
i
wonder
if
that
will
be
mentioned
tonight
during
the
debate
i
don't
know
i
have
feeling
i
don't
know
what
do
you
think
steve
kevin
do
you
think
they'll
be
talking
about
that
i
don't
think
so
trump
said
referring
to
house
minority
whip
steve
scalise
r-la
and
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-calif
that's
a
good
debate
point
he
said
as
they
hit
me
left
and
right
i'll
say
african
american
unemployment
is
the
lowest
it's
ever
been
and
just
leave
the
stage
and
say
thank
you
very
much
good
luck
he
said
drawing
laughter
and
applause
from
republican
lawmakers
he
added
his
usual
economic
campaign
pitch
that
african
american
and
overall
u.s.
poverty
rates
have
reached
record
lows
i
mean
how
do
you
lose
this
debate
how
do
you
lose
this
debate
that's
a
tough
one
to
beat
also
he
said
earlier
in
the
night
trump
said
that
he
would
have
to
miss
watching
the
democratic
debate
and
predicting
that
one
of
the
three
candidates
leading
in
the
polls
will
ultimately
win
the
party's
nomination
next
year
it's
too
bad
i'm
going
to
miss
it
i'm
going
to
have
to
somehow
have
it
taped
i
didn't
even
tell
them
about
that
so
maybe
it's
not
that
important
but
it
is
important
trump
told
reporters
on
the
south
lawn
of
the
white
house
as
he
left
to
speak
at
the
house
gop
retreat
in
baltimore
this
summer
trump
called
baltimore
the
most
unsafe
city
in
the
country
and
a
disgusting
rat
and
rodent-infested
mess
trump
added
that
he
looked
forward
to
returning
home
and
watching
a
rerun
of
the
debate
the
president
would
not
say
who
he
thought
his
strongest
opponent
might
be
they
all
have
their
weaknesses
and
their
strengths
i
think
that
they're
very
different
he
said
you
certainly
have
a
lot
of
different
voices
out
there
it
would
look
to
me
that
it
would
be
elizabeth
warren
and
it
looks
like
joe
may
will
be
able
to
get
there
maybe
not
i
don't
know
certainly
bernie
is
there
he's
number
three
they're
so
far
in
the
lead
the
three
of
them
trump
added
then
that
he
thought
biden
will
be
able
to
make
it
to
the
nomination
beating
warren
and
sanders
but
only
if
he
doesn't
make
any
major
mistakes
asked
if
he
respected
any
of
the
democrats
debating
thursday
night
trump
responded
that
he
did
i
respect
all
of
them
i
respect
every
one
let
me
tell
you
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage
to
run
for
office
i
respect
all
of
them
see
that
i'm
getting
to
be
much
better
as
a
politician
you
never
thought
you'd
hear
that
answer
around
the
time
he
spoke
the
president's
re-election
campaign
blasted
out
a
poll
to
its
supporters
that
asked
people
to
choose
between
trump
and
a
slew
of
derogatory
adjectives
used
to
describe
