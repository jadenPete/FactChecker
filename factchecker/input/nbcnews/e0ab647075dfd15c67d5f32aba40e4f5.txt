in

pursuing

politically
motivated
investigations
under
the
guise
of

president
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
appear
to
have
increased
pressure
on
the
ukrainian
government
and
its
justice
system
in
service
of
president
trump's
re-election
campaign
and
the

adam
schiff

wrote
noting
that
one
of
the
targets
of
this
alleged
activity
appears
to
be
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
family
the
new
york
times
has
reported
extensively
on
an
effort
by
giuliani
to
push
the
ukrainian
government
to
investigate
whether
there
was
anything
improper
about
the
overlap
between
biden's
diplomatic
efforts
in
ukraine
and
his
son's
role
with
a
gas
company
there
giuliani
also
sought
to
have
the
country's
government
look
into
whether
ukrainian
officials
tried
to
harm
trump's
campaign
by
releasing
damaging
information
on
the
president's
former
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
the
times
reported
biden
has
insisted
there
was
nothing
amiss
giuliani
and
officials
at
the
white
house
and
the
state
department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
from
nbc
news
giuliani
has
said
he
is
acting
as
a
private
citizen
he
told
the
times
in
may
that
his
efforts
in
ukraine
had
the
president's
full
support
adding
he
basically
knows
what
i'm
doing
sure
as
his
lawyer
the
chairman
cited
a
recent
cnn
report
that
the
trump
administration
is
threatening
to
withhold
security
assistance
to
ukraine
which
they
said
was
only
the
latest
in
a
series
of
actions
in
which
president
trump
appears
to
undermine
u.s.
foreign
policy
to
placate
russia
and
place
his
personal
interests
above
the
national
interest
the
house
democrats
cited
a
july
call
between
trump
and
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
in
which
they
said
trump
apparently
focused
on
the
investigations
telling
zelensky
that
he
is
convinced
the
new
ukrainian
government
will
be
able
to
quickly
improve
the
image
of
ukraine
and
complete
the
investigation
of
corruption
cases
which
inhibited
the
interaction
between
ukraine
and
the
usa
the
next
day
kurt
volker
the
u.s.
special
representative
for
ukraine
was
dispatched
to
meet
with
zelensky
the
democrats
say
days
later
they
say
giuliani
met
andriy
yermak
an
aide
to
zelensky
in
spain
where
the
ukrainian
president's
personal
attorney
who
has
no
official
administration
or
diplomatic
position
reportedly
suggested
a
possible
heads
of
state
meeting
between
trump
and
zelensky
the
state
department
subsequently
acknowledged
that
volker
used
his
office
to
facilitate
the
meeting
between
the
two
the
democrats
say
although
officials
say
giuliani
does
not
speak
on
behalf
of
the
u.s.
government
yermak
publicly
stated
that
it
was
not
clear
to
him
whether
mr
giuliani
was
representing
mr
trump
in
their
talks
the
democrats
wrote
if
the
president
is
trying
to
pressure
ukraine
into
choosing
between
defending
itself
from
russian
aggression
without
u.s.
assistance
or
leveraging
its
judicial
system
to
serve
the
ends
of
the
trump
campaign
this
would
represent
a
staggering
abuse
of
power
a
boon
to
moscow
and
a
betrayal
of
the
public
trust
the
chairmen
wrote
that
the
state
department
has
apparently
acted
as
a
broker
between
president
trump's
personal
attorney
and
ukrainian
officials
raises
serious
concerns
that
the
department
is
complicit
in
a
corrupt
scheme
that
undercuts
u.s.
foreign
policy
and
national
security
interests
in
favor
of
the
president's
personal
agenda
