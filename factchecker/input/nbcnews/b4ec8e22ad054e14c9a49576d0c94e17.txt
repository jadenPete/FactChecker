appeals
court
revives
lawsuit
against
trump
over
his
businesses
in
july
a
federal
appeals
court
tossed
a
similar
challenge
to
trump's
ownership
of
a
luxury
hotel
near
the
white
house
washington
a
federal
appeals
court
friday
breathed
new
life
into
a
lawsuit
claiming
that
president
donald
trump's
profiting
from
restaurants
and
hotels
patronized
by
government
officials
violates
the
constitution
in
late
a
judge
threw
the
case
out
concluding
that
the
groups
behind
the
lawsuit
did
not
have
a
legal
right
to
bring
the
challenge
over
a
violation
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
which
forbids
a
president
to
receive
financial
benefits
from
foreign
or
domestic
governments
but
by
a
vote
a
panel
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
said
the
judge
was
wrong
to
dismiss
the
case
and
sent
it
back
with
instructions
to
continue
with
the
lawsuit
it
was
brought
by
a
group
of
restaurant
and
hotel
owners
who
say
that
both
foreign
and
state
government
officials
patronize
trump
hotels
and
restaurants
to
curry
favor
from
the
president
putting
them
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
and
hurting
their
businesses
the
president's
establishments
offer
government
patrons
something
that
the
plaintiffs
cannot
the
opportunity
by
enriching
the
president
to
obtain
favorable
governmental
treatment
from
the
president
and
the
executive
branch
the
appeals
court
said
in
dissent
judge
john
walker
said
the
courts
have
never
clearly
defined
the
constitution's
emoluments
clauses
he
called
the
lawsuit
deeply
political
president
trump
was
democratically
elected
by
the
american
people
and
he
was
elected
with
his
business
holdings
and
brand
prominence
in
full
view
a
group
called
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
in
washington
which
originally
filed
the
lawsuit
applauded
friday's
ruling
we
never
wanted
to
be
in
a
position
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
to
court
to
compel
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
follow
the
constitution
the
group
said
in
a
statement
however
president
trump
left
us
no
choice
and
we
will
proudly
fight
as
long
as
needed
to
ensure
americans
are
represented
by
an
ethical
government
under
the
rule
of
law
the
ruling
runs
counter
to
a
decision
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
tossed
out
a
similar
lawsuit
in
july
brought
by
the
attorneys
general
of
washington
d.c.
and
maryland
on
behalf
of
businesses
that
compete
with
the
trump
international
hotel
in
washington
that
ruling
said
there
was
no
clear
proof
that
trump's
ownership
of
the
luxury
hotel
situated
five
blocks
from
the
white
house
was
creating
competition
with
local
convention
centers
and
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
the
local
governments
couldn't
show
how
any
such
competition
if
it
existed
could
be
legally
prevented
but
friday's
decision
took
a
different
view
saying
courts
are
not
powerless
and
could
require
public
disclosure
of
the
president's
private
business
dealings
with
government
officials
through
the
trump
establishments
which
may
discourage
presidential
action
that
appears
to
improperly
reward
such
patronage
another
emoluments
clause
challenge
has
been
brought
by
members
of
congress
claiming
that
the
president's
acceptance
of
foreign
emoluments
without
congressional
approval
violates
the
constitution
