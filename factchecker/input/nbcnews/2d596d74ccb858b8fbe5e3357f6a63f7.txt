follow
the
procedures

president
trump
went
to
great
lengths
to
obstruct
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
including
the
president's
attempts
to
remove
the
special
counsel
and
encourage
witnesses

lie
and
to
destroy
or
conceal
evidence
nadler

anyone

face
federal
criminal

above
the

nadler
added
the
unprecedented
corruption
coverup
and
crimes
by
the
president
are
under
investigation
by
the
committee
as
we
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
or
other
article
remedies
the
adoption
of
these
additional
procedures
is
the
next
step
in
that
process
and
will
help
ensure
our
impeachment
hearings
are
informative
to
congress
and
the
public
while
providing
the
president
with
the
ability
to
respond
to
evidence

him
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
said
the
resolution
was
just
the
latest
gambit
in
a
wider
effort
to
hamstring
the
president
sadly
it's
just
more
of
the
same
from
the
democrats
she
said
in
a
statement
they
should
be
focusing
on
the
needs
of
our
country
instead
their
obsessive
vendetta
against
this
president
continues
the
decision

draft
a

step
in
the

it
represents
a
significant
step
forward
this
committee

absolutely
in

impeachment
investigation

falsely
assume
this
means
the
house
is
impeaching
trump
it's
going
to
be
a
media
circus
and
you'll
have
all
these
confused
constituents
who
think
impeachment
is
happening
but
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
the
democratic
leadership
aide
said
of
the
resolution

sarcastically
let's
set
the
table
in
case
we
have
dinner
but
we
haven't
started
making
the
food
the
release
comes
just
as
members
return
from
a
six-week
recess
during
that
time
the
committee
has
expanded
their
probe
to
include
potential
violations
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
and
hush
payments
made
during

presidential
campaign
to
two
women

affairs
with
trump
relationships
