share
this
alarm
bells
should
be
ringing
at
trump
hq
after
n.c.
house
scare
analysis
it's
always
better
to
win
than
lose
but
republicans
holding
onto
a
gop
seat
by
a
hair
is
reason
for
the
president
to
worry
heading
into
washington
republican
rep
elect
dan
bishop's
narrow
victory
in
a
north
carolina
special
election
had
drawn
a
half-dozen
excited
tweets
from
president
donald
trump
by
early
wednesday
morning
dan
bishop
was
down
points
weeks
ago
he
then
asked
me
for
help
we
changed
his
strategy
together
and
he
ran
a
great
race
trump
tweeted
big
rally
last
night
a
point
win
in
a
district
that
trump
carried
by
points
in
qualified
as
monumental
he
said
in
a
phone
call
with
bishop
and
on
one
level
it's
hard
to
argue
with
that
interpretation
in
the
context
of
trump's
sub-
percent
national
approval
rating
the
drubbing
his
party
took
in
the
midterm
elections
and
an
ever-more-chaotic
administration
atmosphere
that
saw
the
firing
of
his
third
national
security
adviser
in
less
than
three
years
on
tuesday
north
carolina
special
election
full
results
and

but
as
a
matter
of
measuring
his
standing
before
he
faces
voters
next
year
barely
holding
onto
turf
that's
been
in
republican
hands
for
decades
where
he
himself
jetted
in
for
a
last-minute
rally
to
pump
energy
into
the
gop
base
monday
night
should
be
cause
for
the
president
to
sound
alarm
bells
in
his
ranks
rather
than
blast
triumphant
notes
from
his
own
horn
republicans
should
feel
relieved
they
avoided
a
loss
but
here's
why
bishop's
win
isn't
encouraging
there
are
gop-held
house
seats
less
republican
than
north
carolina's
th
district
david

tuesday
night
while
trump's
charge
is
different
than
that
of

he
has
to

an

for

and
yet
trump
could
take
satisfaction
in
one
obvious
subplot
the
district
includes
a
portion
of
fayetteville's
cumberland
county
and
those
precincts
had
favored
the
democrat
in
the
last
house
election
they
were
trump's
target
when
he
held
the
rally
for
bishop
on
monday
at
the
crown
expo
center
in
fayetteville
tucked
just
inside
the
th
district
on
tuesday
bishop
won
the
cumberland
county
part
of
the
district
by
six
votes
no
two
races
are
exactly
alike
but
this
one
was
a
reasonably
good
bellwether
because
it
was
a
do-over
of
a
tainted
contest
from
november
in
which
republican
mark
harris
defeated
democrat
dan
mccready
by
four-tenths
of
a
point
amid
allegations
of
election
fraud
this
time
fewer
than
people
voted
compared
to
almost
in
november
the
key
takeaways
bishop
out-performed
harris
in
rural
areas
and
mccready
beat
his
own
numbers
in
suburban
mecklenburg
county
increasing
his
share
of
the
vote
there
from
percent
to
percent
trump
strategy
for
winning
re-election
relies
heavily
on
massive
rural
republican
turnout
in
swing
states
as
it
did
in
but
some
republicans
have
privately
questioned
whether
he
can
win
if
he
doesn't
find
a
way
to
reclaim
some
of
the
suburban
voters
he's
alienated
during
his
presidency
frank
luntz
a
veteran
pollster
and
message-maker
for
gop
candidates
likened
bishop's
win
to
a
heavily
favored
college
football
team
hanging
on
in
the
final
minutes
against
an
opponent
that
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
ballgame
conservative
twitter
celebrating
a
point
win
in
a
gop
district
from
is
like
michigan
celebrating
a
win
over
army
in
double-overtime
he
wrote
on
twitter
of
course
tuesday
night's
election
was
just
one
of
house
races
run
in
the
vacuum
of
a
special
election
in
an
off-year
between
midterms
and
the
next
presidential
contest
but
it
serves
as
another
data
point
along
with
many
months
of
polling
on
the
president's
approval
rating
voters
attitudes
and
head-to-head
matchups
between
trump
and
potential
democratic
foes
that
suggests
he
has
a
lot
of
work
to
do
to
reclaim
voters
and
political
turf
he's
lost
since
nothing
trump
has
done
so
far
including
taking
a
self-congratulatory
victory
lap
tuesday
night
and
wednesday
morning
suggests
he's
heard
that
wake-up
call
yet
