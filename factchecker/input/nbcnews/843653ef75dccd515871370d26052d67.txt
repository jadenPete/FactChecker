includes

to
help
women
who

like
the

of

to
and
from
a

city
council
members
in
austin

voted

to
allocate
to
make
abortion
care
more
accessible
to
low-income
women
by
funding
services
like
travel
lodging
child
care
and
other
logistical
support
for

the
procedure
the
funding
part
of
the
municipal
budget
package
passed
tuesday
night
by
the
austin
city
council
makes
the
texas
capital
the
first-ever
u.s.
city
to
publicly
fund
logistical
support
for
abortion
care
experts
said
the
move
follows
several
other
high-profile
efforts
by
progressive
cities
and
states
in
recent
months
to
provide
women
with
financial
and
other
assistance
for
easier
access
to
abortions
every
day
the
anti-abortion
elements
in
texas
in
washington
d.c.
and
elsewhere
wake
up
and
think
how
can
we
restrict
access
to
abortion
today
that
makes
it
our
job
every
day
to
work
to
expand
access
to
abortion
and
health
care
and
other
basic
services
related
to
abortion
austin
city
council
member
greg
casar
a
co-sponsor
of
the
budget
amendment
told
nbc
news
austin
mayor
steve
adler
added
in
statement
that
the
city
of
austin
has
taken
action
to
address
challenges
people
are
facing
as
a
result
of
state
and
federal
laws
that
make
it
difficult
for
families
seeking
an
abortion
this
budget
amendment
will
help
ensure
austinites
can
make
the
best
choices
for
themselves
and
their
families
adler
said
under
austin
city
rules
adler
votes
on
budget
proposals
with
the
rest
of
the
council
but
does
not
need
to
sign
a
passed
budget
into
law
under
the
provisions
of
the
budget
amendment
the
will
be
given
to
austin's
public
health
department
which
will
then
make
it
available
via
a
competitive
bidding
process
for
groups
that
are
already
providing
so-called
logistical
support
for
poor
women
who
need
abortion
care
that
support
includes
access
to
services
that
effectively
act
as
barriers
to
abortion
for
poor
women
including
the
cost
of
travel
to
and
from
abortion
clinics
lodging
if
the
woman
wants
to
keep
the
procedure
private
from
the
people
she
lives
with
and
child
care
the
money
cannot
be
used
for
abortion
care
itself
this
is
a
really
creative
way
to
meet
some
very
serious
unmet
needs
said
amanda
williams
the
executive
director
of
the
lilith
fund
an
abortion
fund
in
central
texas
that
advised
city
lawmakers
on
the
measure
under
the
measure
the
money
will
only
be
made
available
to
people
from
austin
if
the
abortion
can
be
performed
at
a
clinic
in
austin
under
texas
law
abortions
are
illegal
after
the
th
week
of
pregnancy
it
will
be
and
the
money
will
be
applied
toward
logistics
facilitating
care
in
the
city
but
if
there
is
a
scenario
where
a
woman
would
need
to
travel
to
a
state
where
abortion
care
is
legal
after
the
th
week
of
pregnancy
an
increasingly
common
trend
as
more
states
pass
laws
to
limit
or
ban
abortion
the
money
can
be
used
to
help
the
woman
travel
out
of
state
advocates
of
the
funding
told
nbc
news
it
would
not
violate
any
of
texas
restrictive
abortion
laws
rather
they
explained
the
bill
would
merely
help
low-income
women
who
need
abortion
care
navigate
a
complicated
landscape
when
you're
seeking
abortion
care
in
texas
there
are
a
host
of
laws
on
the
books
that
create
additional
barriers
delays
and
costs
said
national
institute
for
reproductive
health
president
andrea
miller
those
laws
include
the
requirement
that
a
pregnant
woman
visit
an
abortion
clinic
twice
a
woman
must
undergo
a
sonogram
and
then
wait
hours
after
to
have
the
abortion
this
requirement
means
someone
might
have
to
miss
at
least
two
days
of
work
in
addition
texas
law
bans
private
insurance
from
covering
abortion
care
meaning
all
such
care
must
be
paid
for
out
of
pocket
casar
miller
and
others
told
nbc
news
they
were
confident
the
funding
would
also
not
violate
sb
a
state
bill
enacted
earlier
this
year
banning
any
municipality
in
texas
from
allocating
public
funding
to
groups
that
provide
abortion
care
because
it
does
not
actually
fund
the
procedure
the
measure
was
inspired
by
one
put
into
place
by
the
new
york
city
council
which
was
approved
earlier
this
year
new
york
city's
council
members
allocated
for
abortions
for
poor
women
who
live
in
or
who
have
traveled
to
the
city
specifically
to
receive
the
procedure
the
first
time
a
municipality
directly
allocated
money
for
abortion
that
could
be
explicitly
used
for
residents
from
other
locales
we
may
not
be
able
to
fund
abortion
with
city
money
like
new
york
did
but
definitely
we
knew
we
could
help
fund
the
transportation
the
accommodations
the
child
care
people
needed
said
naral
pro-choice
texas
executive
director
aimee
arrambide
the
measure
comes
as
a
rash
of
states
have
passed
restrictive
abortion
laws
intended
to
strike
at
roe
v
wade
while
many
of
those
laws
have
already
been
challenged
in
court
casar
said
he
hopes
that
austin's
action
can
provide
a
model
for
how
blue
cities
in
red
states
can
still
advance
abortion
rights
it's
really
important
for
our
progressive
cities
to
not
just
be
sites
of
resistance
but
to
also
be
places
of
progress
to
be
examples
of
what
governance
could
look
like
if
progressives
ran
more
of
our
states
he
said
so
that
people
see
what
we're
fighting
for
not
just
what
we're
fighting
against
