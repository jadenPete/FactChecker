the
numbers
of
black
rhinos
have
been
increasing
in
recent
years
with
stricter
conservation
management
but
dozens
are
still
illegally
poached
each
year
for
their
horns
which
are
sold
on
the
black
market
for
use
in
traditional
chinese
medicine
and
as
a
status
symbol
the
horns
are
composed
largely
of
the
protein
keratin
also
the
chief
component
in
hair
and
fingernails
legal
well-regulated
hunting
as
part
of
a
sound
management
program
can
benefit
the
conservation
of
certain
species
by
providing
incentives
to
local
communities
to
conserve
the
species
and
by
putting
much-needed
revenue
back
into
conservation
said
laury
parramore
spokeswoman
for
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
decades
federal
regulators
issued
no
import
permits
for
black
rhinos
but
as
populations
rebounded
in
africa
the
obama
administration
issued
three
starting
in
the
trump
administration
has
issued
another
two
though
president
donald
trump
derided
trophy
hunting
in
a
tweet
as
a
horror
show
his
adult
sons
are
avid
big-game
hunters
and
his
administration
reversed
obama-era
restrictions
on
the
import
of
endangered
elephant
and
lion
trophies
from

countries

peyerk
was

get
a

a
louisiana
attorney
who
provides
free

assistance
to
trophy
hunters
through
a

called

a
trophy
hunting

that
has
lobbied
the
trump

to
loosen
import

jackson
was
appointed
in

the
international
wildlife
conservation
council
an
advisory
board
set
up
by

to

jackson
said
he
sees
no
conflict
between
advising
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
on
policy
issues
while
also
petitioning
the
agency
on
the
behalf
of
his
legal
clients
the
permitting
is
just
one
cog
in
the
conservation
wheel
of
what
we
do
jackson
said
friday
we
establish
and
support
programs
on
the
ground
that
enhance
the
survival
of
the
particular
specie
our
mission
is
the
recovery
of
the
species
population
not
the
private
interest
of
the
hunter
the
paid
by
peyrek
went
to
a
trust
fund
set
up
by
the
namibian
government
for
wildlife
management
conservation
rural
development
and
other
activities
aimed
at
promoting
the
coexistence
of
humans
and
wildlife
the
humane
society
criticized
the
federal
decision
to
allow
peyerk
to
import
the
black
rhino's
taxidermied
remains
we
urge
our
federal
government
to
end
this
pay-to-slay
scheme
that
delivers
critically
endangered
rhino
trophies
to
wealthy
americans
while
dealing
a
devastating
blow
to
rhino
conservation
said

humane
society
of
the
united
states
and
humane
society
international
while
we
cannot
turn
back
the
clock
to
save
this
animal
the
administration
can
stop
the
u.s.
from
further
contributing
to
the
demise
of
this
species
by
refusing
future
import
permits
of
black
rhino
trophies
