this
elizabeth
warren
won
the
summer
but
still
has
a
big
challenge
in
front
of
her
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
the
summer
before
the
contests
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
a
liberal
candidate
from
a
new
england
state
is
climbing
in
the
polls
attracting
big
crowds
plus
in
seattle
raising
lots
of
money
from
small
donors
and
campaigning
in
bold
colors
sounds
like
elizabeth
warren's
summer
of
right
well
it
also
applies
to
howard
dean
in
check
out
this
new
york
times
dispatch
from
aug
the
staggering
seemingly
spontaneous
crowds
turning
up
to
meet
dean
about
in
seattle
on
sunday
and
a
similar
number
in
bryant
park
in
manhattan
last
night
are
unheard
of
in
the
days
of
the
race
when
most
candidates
concentrate
on
the
early-voting
states
of
iowa
and
new
hampshire
and
would
seem
formidable
even
in
october
more
yesterday
morning
the
campaign
took
another
audacious
step
saying
that
it
would
broadcast
television
advertisements
in
six
new
states
beginning
on
friday
and
that
it
expected
to
raise
million
in
the
three
months
ending
sept
more
than
any
other
democrat
in
a
similar
period
save
for
president
bill
clinton
in
now
there
are
important
differences
between
dean
and
warren
she's
much
more
disciplined
for
instance
also
bush
s
numbers
were
much
stronger
than
trump's
back
then
when
there
was
concern
about
the
former
vermont
governor's
electability
but
right
now
there's
a
common
theme
between
dean
and
warren
to
their
credit
they've
captivated
rank-and-file
white
democratic
liberals
that
as
dean
and
bernie
sanders
and
gary
hart
all
discovered
isn't
enough
to
win
a
democratic
nomination
and
it's
even
more
true
now
with
the
democratic
party
growing
more
diverse
like
obama
was
able
to
do
in
you
have
to
combine
this
wine
track
with
another
part
of
the
democratic
coalition
and
it's
why
bernie
sanders
isn't
the
dem
candidate
standing
in
warren's
way
right
now
it's
joe
biden
with
that
support
from
african-american
voters
earlier
this
week
we
told
you
that
we'd
be
keeping
our
eyes
on
more
house
gop
retirements
and
yesterday
we
got
two
more
reps
bill
flores
r-texas
and
jim
sensebrenner
r-wis
that
makes
it
house
republicans
and
five
from
texas
alone
who've
said
they
won't
run
for
re-election
in
and
that
doesn't
include
those
who
have
resigned
and
will
have
the
seat
filled
by
a
special
election
yesterday
also
brought
us
the
fourth
house
democrat
who
won't
be
seeking
re-election
rep
susan
davis
d-calif
the
good
news
for
republicans
is
that
the
flores
and
sensenbrenner
seats
should
be
easy
to
defend
in
trump
won
them
by
about
points
each
in
the
bad
news
is
that
these
gop
retirements
probably
won't
be
the
last
we'll
see
last
night
the
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
who
will
participate

have
the
main
takeaways
from
each
candidate
juli
n
castro
towards
the
end
of
his
appearance
he
acknowledged
that
he
might've
done
some
things
differently
as
mayor
of
san
antonio
but
that
he
stood
up
for
clean
water
a
story
where
he
quit
his
job
as
a
lawyer
to
in
order
to
vote
against
a
land
deal
on
city
council
andrew
yang
he
often
brought
up
his
signature
campaign
idea
of
universal
basic
income
arguing
it
would
help
galvanize
americans
by
giving
them
financial
security
to
dedicate
time
and
money
to
fight
climate
change
kamala
harris
she
started
off
her
appearance
by
saying
she
would
declare
an
emergency
on
clean
drinking
water
harris
added
she
would
take
on
the
issue
through
executive
action
in
addition
to
also
re-entering
the
paris
climate
agreement
amy
klobuchar
she
said
in
her
first
week
she'd
bring
the
u.s.
back
into
the
international

bring
back
the
clean
power

in

he
was
pressed
on
whether
he
could
hold
fossil

and
energy
companies
accountable
if
he
attended
a
fundraiser
held
by
andrew
goldman
an
energy
investor
who
co-founded
western
l
g
biden
initially
rejected
the
premise
of
the
audience
question
saying
that
goldman
is
not
a
fossil
fuel
executive
bernie
sanders
he
was
asked
how
he'd
deal
with
the
congressional
filibuster
when
it
came
to
climate
legislation
if
your
question
is
are
we
going
to
need
votes
to
save
the
planet
the
answer
is
no
we
will
not
sanders
said
elizabeth
warren
she
split
from
sen
sanders
on
the
nationalization
of
public
utilities
saying
gosh
you
know
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
gets
you
to
the
solution
pete
buttigieg
he
was
asked
about
the
he
spent
on
private
air
travel
in
his
campaign's
second
fundraising
quarter
buttigieg
said
while
he's
all
for
decarbonizing
jet
fuel
he
doesn't
believe
america
will
ever
abolish
air
travel
beto
o'rourke
he
said
he
would
work
to
meet
a
net-zero
emissions
goal
by
implementing
a
cap-and-trade
system
not
a
carbon
tax
cory
booker
he
said
that
his
plan
calls
for
being
at
zero
carbon
by
the
year
and
he
would
ban
offshore
drilling
as
well
as
ban
fracking

down
on

defense
of
his
numerous
recent
verbal
slip-ups
saying
that
he
has
not
mistaken
policy
substance
per
nbc's
marianna
sotomayor
i
think
it's
fair
to
go
after
a
political
figure
for
anything
he
said
but
here's
the
deal
any
gaffe
that
i
have
made
and
i've
made
gaffes
like
every
politician
i
know
has
have
been
not
about
the
substantive
issue
but
been
about
other
