according
to
multiple
sources
president
donald
trump
cycled
through
a
range
of
conflicting
reactions
tuesday
as
democrats
moved
swiftly
toward
concrete
congressional
action
on
impeachment
the
president
moved
from
dismissing
the
renewed
push
by
democrats
for
impeachment
proceedings
early
in
the
day
to
bemoaning
the
effort's
impact
while
holding
meetings
with
world
leaders
at
the
united
nations
just
a
few
hours
later
to
expressing
social
media
outrage
over
presidential
harassment
as
evening
fell
pelosi
nadler
schiff
and
of
course
maxine
waters
can
you
believe
this
he
asked
in
a
late
afternoon
tweetstorm
shortly
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
announced
the
launch
of
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
by
wednesday
morning
trump
lamented
on
twitter
that
there
has
been
no
president
in
the
history
of
our
country
who
has
been
treated
so
badly
as
i
have
the
democrats
are
frozen
with
hatred
and
fear
he
continued
additionally
calling
the
new
impeachment
push
a
witch
hunt
meanwhile
the
day's
impeachment
developments
were
being
met
inside
his
inner
circle
with
a
mix
of
trepidation
and
defiance
as
the
president
and
his
allies
entered
what
they
acknowledged
was
uncharted
territory
according
to
multiple
sources
familiar
with
their
thinking
pelosi's
move
followed
growing
outrage
among
democrats
at
trump's
reported
pressure
on
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
rival
joe
biden
while
that
country
was
awaiting
u.s.
aid
he'd
delayed
including
a
request
during
a
summer
phone
call
between
the
two
leaders
early
tuesday
trump
dismissed
the
democratic
outrage
as
partisan
posturing
i
think
it's
a
ridiculous
witch
hunt
trump
said
ahead
of
his
morning
remarks
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
reviving
some
of
the
same
pushback
he
used
during
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
i'm
leading
in
the
polls
the
only
way
they
can
stop
me
is
impeachment

news
and
politics
as
news
broke
later
in
the
day
that
pelosi
planned
to
announce
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
trump
said
that
he
would
release
a
transcript
wednesday
morning
you
will
see
it
was
a
very
friendly
and
totally
appropriate
call
he
tweeted
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
the
greatest
and
most
destructive
witch
hunt
of
all
time
democrats
have
called
for
the
full
release
of
a
complaint
by
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower
that
is
said
to
include
but
not
be
limited
to
that
call
a
senior
administration
official
said
the
white
house
was
preparing
to
turn
over
the
whistleblower
complaint
by
this
thursday
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
who
heads
the
house
intelligence
committee
said
a
lawyer
for
the
whistleblower
had
contacted
his
committee
saying
they
would
like
to
testify
and
that
the
panel
has
requested
guidance
from
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
on
how
to
move
forward
later
tuesday
afternoon
ahead
of
a
meeting
by
democratic
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
to
discuss
potential
action
the
president
accused
the
party
of
failing
to
take
action
on
a
range
of
issues
including
gun
safety
due
to
presidential
investigations
so
bad
for
our
country
he
tweeted
the
democratic
house
has
passed
several
gun
safety
measures
the
gop
senate
is
waiting
for
the
president
to
indicate
his
preferred
policy
solutions
on
the
issue
before
taking
action
in
the
wake
of
several
mass
shootings
this
summer
then
during
a
meeting
with
the
iraqi
president
he
ran
through
a
list
of
u.s.
economic
indicators
saying
the
country's
doing
the
best
it's
ever
done
and
i
just
heard
that
pelosi
would
like
to
impeach
if
she
does
that
they
all
say
that's
a
positive
for
me
in
the
election
he
said
you
could
also
say
who
needs
it
it's
bad
for
the
country
trump's
damage
control
efforts
on
the
domestic
front
tuesday
came
as
he
looked
to
make
his
mark
on
the
world
stage
making
a
speech
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
and
holding
a
string
of
meetings
with
world
leaders
such
an
important
day
at
the
united
nations
he
tweeted
tuesday
afternoon
moments
after
pelosi's
announcement
so
much
work
and
so
much
success
and
the
democrats
purposely
had
to
ruin
and
demean
it
with
more
breaking
news
witch
hunt
garbage
so
bad
for
our
country
full
coverage
trump
impeachment
inquiry
while
democrats
have
spent
the
last
two
years
calling
for
various
lines
of
impeachment
pelosi
is
now
triggering
an
official
process
that
could
translate
to
months
of
hearings
subpoenas
and
witness
testimony
and
potentially
both
new
revelations
and
the
passage
of
articles
of
impeachment
as
the
president
battles
for
re-election
there
is
no
indication
yet
that
trump
could
be
removed
from
office
which
would
require
a
two-thirds
vote
from
the
republican-led
senate
more
than
two-thirds
of
house
democrats
now
back
some
type
of
impeachment
action
still
not
enough
to
claim
the
simple
house
majority
needed
to
pass
articles
of
impeachment
if
the
rest
of
the
caucus
does
not
go
along
but
a
significant
increase
since
last
week
on
monday
the
washington
post
and
other
media
outlets
reported
that
trump
instructed
his
chief
of
staff
to
place
a
hold
on
million
in
military
aid
for
ukraine
in
the
days
before
a
late
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
trump
told
reporters
tuesday
that
his
request
to
withhold
the
aid
was
due
to
his
desire
to
see
greater
european
contributions
to
ukraine's
defense
and
not
linked
to
whether
the
country
would
investigate
the
biden
family
which
media
outlets
have
reported
trump
brought
up
on
the
call
with
zelensky
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
tuesday
he
was
never
given
an
explanation
for
why
the
funds
were
being
withheld
despite
pressing
senior
administration
officials
about
it
at
the
time
the
white
house
has
publicly
sought
to
link
the
latest
controversy
over
whether
trump
sought
help
from
a
foreign
country
to
go
after
one
of
his
chief
political
rivals
to
the
russia
election
meddling
investigation
which
they
have
asserted
exonerated
the
president
though
it
listed
numerous
instances
of
possible
obstruction
of
justice
the
media
pushed
the
russia
lie
for
almost
three
years
with
no
evidence
and
now
they
are
doing
it
all
over
again
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
told
nbc
news
in
a
statement
monday
these
allegations
are
completely
false
but
because
the
media
wants
this
story
to
be
true
so
badly
they'll
once
again
manufacture
a
frenzy
and
drive
ignorant
fake
stories
to
attack
this
president
trump's
campaign
has
also
argued
that
the
latest
effort
is
another
attempt
by
the
democrats
to
overturn
the
election
results
they've
always
wanted
to
impeach
him
and
they've
just
been
shopping
around
for
an
excuse
said
trump
campaign
communications
director
tim
murtaugh
mcconnell's
reaction
to
the
news
late
tuesday
echoed
the
white
house's
line
of
attack
accusing
democrats
of
searching
for
ways
to
reverse
their
election
defeat
since
before
president
trump
was
even
inaugurated
and
a
rush
to
judgment
and
saying
the
move
simply
confirms
that
house
democrats
priority
is
not
making
life
better
for
the
american
people
but
their
nearly
three-year-old
fixation
on
impeachment
so
did
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy's
i
realize
did
not
turn
out
the
way
speaker
pelosi
wanted
it
to
happen
said
mccarthy
r-calif
but
she
cannot
change
the
laws
of
this
congress
she
cannot
unilaterally
decide
we're
in
an
impeachment
inquiry
house
minority
whip
steve
scalise
like
the
president
called
the
impeachment
push
a
witch
hunt
that
was
being
used
to
try
to
go
and
usurp
the
results
of
an
election
in
while
sources
close
to
the
president
said
they
didn't
want
to
see
impeachment
they
were
prepared
to
argue
it
could
be
helpful
in
mobilizing
the
core
supporters
inside
the
president's
base
some
allies
predicted
the
move
would
backfire
on
democrats
particularly
if
the
transcript
being
released
wednesday
failed
to
show
a
smoking
gun
and
the
president's
campaign
was
already
working
to
capitalize
on
the
upcoming
impeachment
fight
over
the
course
of
several
hours
the
campaign
sent
multiple
fundraising
pitches
to
supporters
including
the
launch
of
an
official
impeachment
defense
task
force
it
also
released
a
video
attacking
democrats
calling
for
impeachment
which
murtaugh
said
had
been
ready
for
weeks
in
case
the
democrats
were
that
dumb
and
they
were
inside
the
white
house
this
round
of
impeachment
talks
was
viewed
as
more
politically
perilous
than
during
the
russia
investigation
said
one
white
house
aide
whether
and
how
the
white
house
is
able
to
spin
the
transcript
and
what
the
polling
indicates
over
the
next
few
days
will
determine
if
this
is
yet
another
scandal
to
weather
or
a
marked
shift
in
public
sentiment
the
aide
said
ahead
of
the
pelosi
announcement
republicans
in
congress
had
been
largely
silent
on
the
issue
with
allies
backing
his
allegations
of
corruption
by
biden
the
most
critical
gop
reaction
came
from
sen
mitt
romney
r-utah
who
told
nbc
news
monday
that
trump
should
make
available
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
has
been
deemed
to
be
credible
and
urgent
i
think
it'd
be
very
helpful
to
get
the
bottom
of
the
facts
romney
said
if
they
don't
it
will
be
up
to
the
house
to
decide
how
to
proceed
