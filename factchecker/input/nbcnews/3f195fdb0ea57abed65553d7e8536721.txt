washington
the
number
of
americans
without
health
insurance
edged
up
in
the
first
evidence
from
the
government
that
coverage
gains
from
president
barack
obama's
health
care
plan
might
be
eroding
under
president
donald
trump
the
census
bureau
also
said
in
an
annual
report
tuesday
that
household
income
rose
last
year
at
its
slowest
pace
in
four
years
and
finally
matched
its
previous
peak
set
in
median
household
income
rose
in
to
an
inflation-adjusted
from
in
the
data
suggest
that
the
economic
expansion
now
the
longest
on
record
at
more
than
years
is
still
struggling
to
provide
widespread
benefits
to
the
u.s.
population
solid
gains
in
household
incomes
in
the
past
four
years
have
returned
the
median
only
to
where
it
was
two
decades
ago
and
despite
strong
growth
last
year
in
the
number
of
americans
working
full
time
and
year-round
the
number
of
people
with
private
health
insurance
remained
flat
one
bright
spot
in
the
report
was
that
the
poverty
rate
fell
for
a
fourth
straight
year
to
its
lowest
point
since
the
proportion
of
households
led
by
women
that
were
poor
fell
to
a
record
low
while
any
reduction
in
poverty
or
increase
in
income
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
most
families
have
just
barely
made
up
the
ground
lost
over
the
past
decade
said
elise
gould
senior
economist
at
the
liberal
economic
policy
institute
though
income
inequality
narrowed
last
year
it
remains
near
record
levels
reached
in
last
year
the
richest
of
the
u.s.
population
captured
of
household
income
an
estimated
million
people
of
the
population
went
without
health
insurance
in
that
was
an
increase
of
million
uninsured
people
or
percentage
point
more
people
were
covered
by
medicare
reflecting
the
aging
of
the
baby
boomers
but
medicaid
coverage
declined
the
number
of
uninsured
children
also
rose
and
there
were
more
uninsured
adults
ages
though
the
increase
in
the
number
of
uninsured
americans
last
year
was
modest
it
could
be
a
turning
point
the
first
real
sign
that
coverage
gains
under
obama
could
be
at
least
partly
reversed
this
year
the
number
of
uninsured
could
rise
again
because
a
previous
republican-led
congress
repealed
fines
under
the
affordable
care
act
for
people
who
remain
uninsured
if
they
can
afford
coverage
the
census
report
is
sure
to
play
into
presidential
politics
health
care
is
the
leading
issue
for
democrats
with
proposals
including
sen
bernie
sanders
call
for
a
government-run
system
to
cover
everyone
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
idea
for
expanding
obama's
law
and
adding
a
government
plan
open
to
virtually
anyone
democrats
are
laying
the
blame
trump
long
accusing
his
administration
of
deliberately
undermining
obama's
health
care
law
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
tuesday
blamed
trump's
cruel
health
care
sabotage
for
the
rising
number
of
uninsured
people
in
a
statement
the
california
democrat
said
trump's
ongoing
efforts
to
erode
obama's
health
law
have
forced
americans
to
live
in
constant
fear
of
an
accident
or
injury
that
could
spell
financial
ruin
for
their
families
trump
spent
most
of
his
first
year
in
office
unsuccessfully
trying
to
get
a
republican
congress
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
he
is
now
asking
a
federal
appeals
court
to
overturn
it
as
unconstitutional
the
president
also
slashed
the
program's
sign-up
season
ad
budget
and
scaled
back
funding
to
help
people
navigate
the
enrollment
process
trump
also
removed
a
subsidy
for
insurers
thereby
triggering
a
jump
in
premiums
yet
aca
enrollment
has
held
fairly
steady
with
about
million
people
covered
by
its
mix
of
subsidized
private
plans
and
a
medicaid
expansion
for
low-income
individuals
the
census
report
found
that
medicaid
coverage
declined
by
percent
from
