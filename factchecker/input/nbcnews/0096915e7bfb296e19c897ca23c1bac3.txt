officials
called
on
the

to
increase
the
value
of
those
vouchers
to
account
for

rent
newsom
said
in
the
letter
dated
monday
that
state
and
local
governments
have
increased
their
support
for
homeless
programs
but
in
contrast
your
administration
proposed
significant
cuts
to
public
housing
and
programs
like
the
community
development
block
grant
but
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
ben
carson

saying
that
california's
policies
on
law
enforcement
an
overregulated
housing
market
and
sanctuary
policies
regarding
people
living
in
the
country
illegally
have
driven
up
housing
costs
while
increasing
demand
your
letter
seeks
more
federal
dollars
for
california
from
hardworking
american
taxpayers
but
fails
to
admit
that
your
state
and
local
policies
have
played
a
major
role
in
creating
the
current
crisis
carson
wrote
carson
said
that
nearly
california
households
already
receive
some
kind
of
federal
housing
assistance
and
that
federal
taxpayers
are
clearly
doing
their
part
to
help
solve
the
crisis
courts
have
limited
what
cities
can
do
to
clean
up
homeless
encampments
the
ap

the
los
