the

the

matchup
for
thursday
night's
debate
here
at

former

biden
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
a
test
of
the
establishment
front-runner
against
the
rising
liberal
insurgent
was
mostly
a
dud
that
was
good
for
both
of
them
bad
for
the
also-rans
and
is
unlikely
to
change
the
basic
dynamics
of
a
race
in
which
no
candidate
is
close
to
carrying
a
majority
nationally
or
in
any
of
the
early

sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
she
kept
to
her
game
plan
which
is
to
communicate
directly
to
voters
largely
ignoring
her
opponents
and
moderators
warren
still
hasn't
answered
big
questions
about
how
she
plans
to
implement
some
of
her
more
ambitious
agenda
items
or
to
pay
for
them
but
that
hasn't
arrested
her
rise
so
far
former
vice
president
joe
biden
he
came
to
fight
and
his
fans
had
good
reason
to
be
reassured
by
both
his
more
aggressive
posture
toward
his
foes
and
his
energy
but
his
a
game
still
had
some
weak
spots
he
fumbled
on
a
question
about
race
at
the
historically
black
college
and
offered
up
word
salad
on
some
answers
former
hud
secretary
juli
n
castro
his
punchy
performance
may
have
been
the
most
noteworthy
of
the
night
and
would
score
highest
on
a
volatility
index
many
observers
thought
his
attacks
on
biden
over
immigration
and
even
the
former
vice
president's
instant
recall
would
backfire
but
others
saw
him
saying
out
loud
what
biden
critics
are
thinking
and
possibly
opening
a
path
to
donations
and
new
voters
south
bend
mayor
pete
buttigieg
no
one
had
ever
told
the
story
of
coming
out
as
gay
during
a
presidential
debate
before
buttigieg
did
thursday
night
a
historic
political
first
he
gave
the
kind
of
smart
thoughtful
answers
to
various
questions
that
democrats
have
come
to
expect
from
him
but
didn't
seize
control
of
the
stage
for
long
periods
of
time
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
harris
had
several
awkward
moments
including
when
she
made
a
joke
about
president
donald
trump's
size
comparing
him
to
the
wizard
in
the
wizard
of
oz
it
was
trump
she
focused
on
this
time
instead
of
her
democratic
rivals
and
that
may
have
kept
her
out
of
damaging
scrapes
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
d-texas
he's
at
the
point
at
which
other
candidates
are
praising
him
for
his
handling
of
shooting
massacres
in
his
home
state
both
a
sign
of
their
respect
for
his
dedication
and
sincerity
on
the
issue
but
also
perhaps
an
indication
that
they
are
not
threatened
by
the
prospect
that
they
might
aid
him
o'rourke
spoke
passionately
about
gun
control
thursday
night
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
if
his
goal
was
to
offend
no
one
he
succeeded
but
that
may
be
too
little
to
convince
many
voters
to
jump
ship
from
other
candidates
and
join
his
cause
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
her
best
moment
of
the
night
came
in
her
closing
when
she
described
fighting
for
longer
guaranteed
hospital
stays
for
new
mothers
in
her
home
state
she
opened
aggressively
alluding
to
warren's
refrain
of
i've
got
a
plan
for
that
and
saying
i've
got
a
better
way
but
klobuchar
didn't
get
much
air
time
and
didn't
distinguish
herself
much
from
the
pack
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
sanders
became
visibly
agitated
during
some
of
his
exchanges
with
biden
over
health
insurance
plans
as
well
as
their
past
votes
on
the
iraq
war
and
other
issues
but
there
wasn't
much
new
from
sanders
or
from
the
candidates
who
portray
his
policies
as
out
of
the
mainstream
andrew
yang
the
businessman-turned-neophyte
politician
talked
about
a
plan
to
give
away
a
month
to
more
families
as
he
promotes
his
universal
basic
income
idea
he
racially
stereotyped
himself
and
he
made
several
jokes
that
fell
flat
it
remains
unlikely
that
he
will
win
the
democratic
nomination
