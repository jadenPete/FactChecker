share
this
north
carolina
will
remain
a
hot
spot
through
november
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
for
all
of
the
attention
that
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
get
due
to
president
trump's
surprising
victories
in
those
states
in
don't
forget
that
north
carolina
with
its
electoral
votes
remains
an
important
battleground
state
in
that's
the
foot
reminder
when
it
comes
to
today's
nc-
congressional
do-over
election
where
democrat
dan
mccready
faces
off
against
republican
dan
bishop
in
a
district
that
trump
won
by
points
in
trump
carried
the
tar
heel
state
by
points
in
and
the
polling
especially
before
the
comey
letter
in
the
last
two
weeks
had
it
even
closer
than
that
so
in
addition
to
north
carolina
being
a
presidential
battleground
state
in
it
also
features
a
competitive
senate
race
with
vulnerable
sen
thom
tillis
r-n
c.
up
for
re-election
a
competitive
gubernatorial
race
with
dem
roy
cooper
up
for
re-election
and
the
gop
presidential
convention
which
will
take
place
in
charlotte
oh
and
the
state
is
going
to
have
new
state
legislative
district
lines
after
state
judges
ruled
that
the
current
ones
are
illegal
partisan
gerrymanders
so
don't
sleep
on
north
carolina
over
the
next
months
that
was
the
margin
in
the
original
nc-
race
last
november
when
republican
mark
harris
received
votes
and
democrat
dan
mccready
got
the
results
were
thrown
out
after
the
state
discovered
illegal
ballot
harvesting
but
given
that
close
margin
here
are
the
major
county-by-county
percentages
if
you
want
to
see
how
mccready
is
performing
in
tonight's
nc-
do-over
compared
with

sharpie-gate
has
produced
plenty
of
laughs
but
yesterday's
report
by
the
new
york
times
wasn't
funny
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
threatened
to
fire
top
employees
at
the
federal
scientific
agency
responsible
for
weather
forecasts
last
friday
after
the
agency's
birmingham
office
contradicted
president
trump's
claim
that
hurricane
dorian
might
hit
alabama
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
discussion
the
paper
writes
mr
ross
phoned
neil
jacobs
the
acting
administrator
of
noaa
from
greece
where
the
secretary
was
traveling
for
meetings
and
instructed
dr
jacobs
to
fix
the
agency's
perceived
contradiction
of
the
president
the
time
adds
and
dr
jacobs
objected
to
the
demand
and
was
told
that
the
political
staff
at
noaa
would
be
fired
if
the
situation
was
not
fixed
according
to
the
three
individuals
who
requested
anonymity
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
episode
a
commerce
department
spokesperson
disputed
the
nyt
report
in
a
statement
to
nbc

the
new

times
story
is
false

not
threaten
