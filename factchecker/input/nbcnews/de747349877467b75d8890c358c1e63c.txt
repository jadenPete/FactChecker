share
this
called
out
by
meteorologists
trump
clings
to
claim
dorian
could
have
hit
alabama
what
i
said
was
accurate
trump
tweeted
thursday
morning
a
day
after
showing
reporters
a
week-old
hurricane
map
that
had
apparently
been
doctored
under
fire
from
prominent
meteorologists
for
giving
out
incorrect
information
on
the
path
of
hurricane
dorian
president
donald
trump
on
thursday
doubled
down
on
his
assertion
that
the
storm
was
at
one
point
headed
for
alabama
he
said
coverage
of
his
claim
including
the
moment
when
he
showed
a
week-old
map
that
had
been
doctored
with
a
sharpie
was
meant
to
demean
him
in
the
early
days
of
the
hurricane
when
it
was
predicted
that
dorian
would
go
through
miami
or
west
palm
beach
even
before
it
reached
the
bahamas
certain
models
strongly
suggested
that
alabama
georgia
would
be
hit
as
it
made
its
way
through
florida
to
the
gulf
trump
tweeted
instead
it
turned
north
and
went
up
the
coast
where
it
continues
now
in
the
one
model
through
florida
the
great
state
of
alabama
would
have
been
hit
or
grazed
he
continued
in
the
path
it
took
no
read
my
full
fema
statement
what
i
said
was
accurate
all
fake
news
in
order
to
demean
trump
returned
to
the
subject
again
about
two
hours
later
tweeting
alabama
was
going
to
be
hit
or
grazed
and
then
hurricane
dorian
took
a
different
path
up
along
the
east
coast
the
fake
news
knows
this
very
well
that's
why
they're
the
fake
news
he
followed
this
up
late
thursday
afternoon
with
more
tweets
in
defense
of
his
position
including
additional
maps
that
also
dated
to
last
week
hours
later
the
white
house
released
an
additional
statement
from
a
homeland
security
adviser
rear
admiral
peter
brown
in
which
brown
claimed
trump
had
been
briefed
on
the
possibility
of
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
southeastern
alabama
the
sharpie
is
mightier
trump
mocked
after
that
map
of
dorian's
path
the
president
has
faced
pushback
from
weather
analysts
over
his
fixation
on
the
hurricane
possibly
hitting
alabama
bill
karins
a
meteorologist
for
nbc
news
broke
down
the
president's
inaccurate
comments
on
msnbc's
the
rachel
maddow
show
on
wednesday
night
at
this
point
should
we
apologize
to
everyone
the
national
hurricane
center
all
the
emergency
managers
and
everyone
that
evacuated
in
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
that
may
be
watching
right
now
trying
to
get
some
facts
and
information
karins
asked
ryan
maue
a
meteorologist
told
the
associated
press
that
trump
must
strive
for
accuracy
if
he
wants
to
provide
helpful
information
to
the
public
facing
a
potential
emergency
if
he's
going
to
be
a
provider
of
up-to-date
information
he
needs
to
be
up
to
date
maue
said
phil
klotzbach
a
research
scientist
in
the
department
of
atmospheric
science
at
colorado
state
university
emailed
the
ap
saying
trump
should
have
just
admitted
he
made
a
mistake
and
moved
on
to
the
confusion
of
some
when
the
hurricane's
path
was
projected
sunday
to
go
up
the
east
coast
avoiding
alabama
trump
tweeted
in
addition
to
florida
south
carolina
north
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
will
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
about
minutes
later
the
national
weather
service
in
birmingham
alabama
tweeted
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
because
the
storm
will
remain
too
far
east
later
that
day
trump
twice
told
reporters
that
alabama
was
in
the
storm's
path
first
saying
outside
of
marine
one
that
alabama
is
going
to
get
a
piece
of
it
it
looks
like
and
later
at
a
federal
emergency
management
agency
briefing
saying
the
storm
may
get
a
little
piece
of
a
great
place
it's
called
alabama
trump
continued
to
press
the
issue
on
monday
upset
over
an
abc
news
report
fact-checking
the
alabama
claim
the
president
tweeted
such
a
phony
hurricane
report
by
lightweight
reporter
jonkarl
of
abcworldnews
i
suggested
yesterday
at
fema
that
along
with
florida
georgia
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
even
alabama
could
possibly
come
into
play
which
was
true
then
on
wednesday
trump
displayed
an
apparently
doctored
map
in
the
oval
office
that
showed
alabama
to
be
within
dorian's
path
the
map
trump
displayed
was
the
same
as
a
model
produced
by
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
last
week
well
before
its
path
along
the
east
coast
had
materialized
showing
the
hurricane's
projected
path
cutting
through
central
florida
but
there
was
one
key
difference
where
the
original
projection
ended
a
smaller
black
circle
that
appeared
to
be
hand-drawn
with
a
sharpie
included
alabama
in
the
model
asked
later
that
day
about
the
discrepancy
with
the
original
map
trump
said
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
karins
addressed
the
episode
on
the
rachel
maddow
show
that
night
saying
national
hurricane
center
personnel
had
left
their
families
on
labor
day
weekend
when
the
storm
really
started
getting
really
nasty
and
do
you
know
how
many
media
inquiries
they
got
today
hey
will
you
guys
comment
on
this
will
you
guys
comment
on
the
president
doing
this
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
he
continued
they're
supposed
to
be
nonpolitical
they're
just
trying
to
give
science
and
then
we've
got
someone
doodling
on
their
maps
that
the
emergency
managers
use
for
preparations
and
evacuations
to
save
people's
lives
the
doctored
map
sparked
internet
users
to
post
an
array
of
memes
under
the
hashtag
sharpiegate
on
twitter
wednesday
evening
trump
tweeted
another
map
dated
aug
a
day
older
than
the
map
he
displayed
in
the
oval
office
showing
alabama
in
the
crosshairs
the
image
credited
to
the
south
florida
water
management
district
includes
fine
print
that
said
national
hurricane
center
advisories
and
county
emergency
management
statements
supersede
this
project
this
graphic
should
complement
not
replace
nhc
discussions
if
anything
on
this
graphic
causes
confusion
ignore
the
entire
product
the
image
notes
speaking
with
the
ap
brian
mcnoldy
a
hurricane
researcher
at
the
university
of
miami
said
of
the
president's
wednesday
evening
tweet
he
has
no
clue
what
he's
talking
about
or
what
is
plotted
on
that
map
at
the
time
of
that
cycle
alabama
was
at
even
lower
risk
than
before
and
it
was
barely
anything
to
start
with
