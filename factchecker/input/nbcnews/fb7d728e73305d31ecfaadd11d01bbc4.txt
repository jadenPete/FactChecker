special
election

is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
the
last
congressional
race
of
is
tuesday's
do-over
in
north
carolina's
ninth
district
after
the
state
discarded
november's
results
due
to
illegal
ballot-tampering
harvesting
this
nc-
special
election
between
democrat
dan
mccready
and
republican
dan
bishop
could
let
us
know
if
the
political
winds
are
still
blowing
in
the
same
direction
they
were
last
november
when
democrats
ended
up
flipping
house
seats
and
winning
control
of
the
chamber
or
it
could
reveal
if
those
winds
have
changed
a
win
by
bishop
and
the
gop
in
a
district
that
president
trump
won
by
points
in
would
keep
the
republicans
magic
number
of
winning
back
the
house
next
year
at
seats
still
even
a
narrow
republican
win
should
be
a
cause
of
concern
a
la
the
special
elections
of
since
the
cook
political
report
identifies
more
than
gop-held
house
seats
being
less
republican
leaning
in
nature
than
nc-
but
a
win
by
mccready
and
the
democrats
and
observers
view
the
contest
as
a
coin
flip
would
not
only
raise
the
gop's
magic
number
to
seats
for
it
would
also
be
a
disastrous
sign
for
republicans
especially
in
a
presidential
battleground
state
like
north
carolina
which
also
will
host
competitive
senate
and
gubernatorial
contests
in
and
guess
who's
headed
to
campaign
for
bishop
tonight
president
trump
who
holds
a
rally
in
fayetteville
n.c.
at
pm
et
after
inspecting
damage
from
hurricane
dorian
in
the
state
that's
the
ad-spending
advantage
that
democrats
enjoy
over
republicans
in
the
nc-
special
general
election
overall
dems
have
spent
over
the
tv
and
radio
airwaves
per
data
from
advertising
analytics
while
republicans
have
spent
but
the
mccready
campaign
has
a
to-
ad-spending
edge
over
the
bishop
campaign
million
to
million
which
is
consistent
with
what
we
saw
in
outside
groups
like
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
and
the
congressional
leadership
fund
have
propped
up
the
gop
side
here
are
the
top
advertisers
in

former
south
carolina
gov
and
congressman
mark
sanford
said
he'll
be
jumping
into
the
republican
presidential
race
joining
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
and
former
rep
joe
walsh
r-ill
who
have
already
announced
bids
to
challenge
trump
next
year
but
this
comes
after
the
south
carolina
republican
party's
executive
committee
voted
to
forgo
its
presidential
primary
next
year
and
nevada
kansas
and
arizona
have
done
signaled
the
same
we're
old
enough
to
remember
when
trump
was
the
one
complaining
about
rigged
democratic
primaries
and
this
morning
trump
tweeted
about
sanford
joining
the
race
secretary
of

certainly
didn't

so

could
do

sherman-esque
deal
you

say
if

i
will
not
serve
all
of
that
business
you
have
not
done
that
why
pompeo
i've
been
pretty
clear

think
it's
unambiguous

more
than
i
do

incredibly
focused
on
what
i'm
doing
it's
not
just

got
opportunities
all
across

world
that's
what
i'm
focused
on
and
i
intend
to
continue
to
do
that
so
long
as
president
trump
asks
me
to
