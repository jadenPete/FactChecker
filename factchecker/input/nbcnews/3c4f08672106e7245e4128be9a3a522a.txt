tests
political
capital
in
last-minute
north
carolina
election
push
a
loss
by
republican
dan
bishop
could
foreshadow
an
uphill
climb
for
republicans
in
fayetteville
n.c.
president
donald
trump
put
his
political
prowess
on
the
line
on
monday
campaigning
here
on
the
eve
of
a
special
election
seen
as
a
bellwether
for
his
own
contest
next
year
the
president's
gamble
that
the
last-minute
stop
where
he
painted
a
dark
picture
of
threats
from
immigration
crime
and
socialism
could
help
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
house
republican
candidate
dan
bishop
tomorrow
is
your
chance
to
send
a
clear
message
to
the
america-hating
left
trump
told
the
crowd
in
fayetteville
on
paper
despite
the
electoral
controversy
that's
rocked
the
district
over
the
past
year
the
race
between
bishop
and
democrat
dan
mccready
should
be
a
shoo-in
for
bishop
who
is
after
all
running
in
a
district
trump
won
by
points
in
instead
it's
a
dead
heat
fueling
jitters
among
republicans
still
reeling
from
heavy
losses
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
a
win
by
mccready
would
send
a
dramatic
warning
sign
to
republicans
over
their
chances
even
a
narrow
gop
victory
in
the
deep-red
district
would
be
cause
for
concern
sparking
even
more
anxiety
for
the
party
is
the
fact
that
north
carolina
which
trump
won
by
less
than
points
in
is
seen
as
a
key
swing
state
for
back
in
washington
trump
faced
renewed
investigations
by
democrats
as
they
returned
monday
from
their
summer
recess
members
showed
no
signs
that
the
break
in
their
district
had
convinced
them
to
let
up
on
their
probes
the
house
judiciary
committee
laid
out
specific
committee
procedures
that
could
set
the
stage
for
a
vote
this
week
to
define
the
committee's
impeachment
investigation
trump
only
made
passing
mentions
to
the
prospect
of
impeachment
they
tried
the
recession
thing
they
tried
the
russia
thing
didn't
work
trump
said
accusing
those
warning
of
a
weakening
economy
or
pushing
for
investigation
of
russian
efforts
to
aid
his
campaign
of
looking
to
those
issues
to
prevent
him
from
getting
re-elected
house
democrats
also
said
they
are
investigating
both
vice
president
mike
pence's
stay
at
trump's
ireland
resort
and
an
overnight
stop
by
air
force
crew
members
at
the
president's
scotland
property
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
separately
investigating
whether
the
president
has
run
afoul
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
he
made
no
mention
of
those
or
two
other
controversies
that
have
encompassed
his
presidency
in
recent
days
a
breakdown
in
talks
with
the
taliban
and
his
continued
insistence
that
hurricane
dorian
was
set
to
hit
alabama
days
after
meteorologists
had
ruled
out
that
possibility
while
trump
trailed
off-topic
at
times
musing
about
how
he
looks
better
under
the
light
of
incandescent
bulbs
and
surveying
the
crowd
on
whether
they
prefer
to
hear
an
item
is
made
in
america
or
made
in
the
usa
he
mostly
stuck
to
his
scripted
talking
points
and
avoided
shifting
attention
away
from
the
purpose
of
his
rally
keeping
republicans
in
the
house
from
losing
yet
another
seat
to
the
democratic
majority
