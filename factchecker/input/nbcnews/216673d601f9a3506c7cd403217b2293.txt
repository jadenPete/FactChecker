hack

confidence
may
be

chief
said
the
greatest
threat
to
the
presidential
election
may
not
be
hacking
of
voting
systems
but
the
hacking
of
americans
faith
in
their

insiders
said
at
a
department
of
homeland
security
cybersecurity
summit
in
washington
this
week
if
we
keep
telling
voters
that
elections
are
screwed
up
then
they're
going
to
start
believing
us
and
stop
voting
said
ohio
secretary
of
state
frank
larose
having
american
citizens
occupied
with
that
narrative
is
what
foreign
autocracies
want
they
want
americans
to
lose
faith
that
their
vote
counts
he
added
during
the
presidential
election
between
hillary
clinton
and
then-candidate
donald
trump
russian-backed
agents
launched
a
sweeping
attempt
to
penetrate
and
disrupt
the
u.s.
election
system
from
all
angles
including
sowing
discord
through
social
media
and
probing
state
voter
registration
databases
according
to
intelligence
community
assessments
and
senate
intelligence
reports
there
is
no
evidence
the
hackers
which
included
russian
military
cyberattack
units
according
to
the
report
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
penetrated
any
non-internet
connected
systems
during
the
race
especially
actual
voting
or
tabulation
machines
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
single
vote
being
changed
but
the
information
about
the
penetration
attempts
as
well
as
the
steps
taken
to
fix
them
can
have
the
unintended
consequences
of
shaking
americans
faith
that
their
vote
counts
when
that
news
is
amplified
and
distorted
by
partisans
and
bad
actors
speakers
at
the
summit
warned
that's
especially
true
if
voters
aren't
happy
with
how
the
vote
turned
out
forty
percent
of
voters
will
feel
a
vote
was
not
fair
if
their
candidate
loses
said
david
becker
executive
director
and
founder
of
the
nonprofit
center
for
election
innovation
and
research
while
shaken
voter
confidence
is
of
paramount
concern
security
experts
warned
of
very
real
ongoing
threats
to
the
election
process
in
the
u.s.
and
other
global
democracies
threats
include
social
media
disinformation
cyber
espionage
against
key
participants
hack
and
leak
operations
and
attacks
on
critical
infrastructure
to
tamper
with
or
alter
votes
said
katelyn
marie
bailey
an
intelligence
analyst
with
cybersecurity
firm
fireeye
which
has
a
partnership
with
the
department
of
homeland
security
to
share
actionable
information
while
the
firm
has
seen
limited
indication
of
successful
attempts
on
election
systems
themselves
it
has
observed
numerous
instances
where
actors
have
targeted
related
organizations
and
entities
including
election
commissions
and
state
boards
of
elections
conducting
recon
potentially
to
look
for
logins
and
pivot
to
be
able
to
intrude
into
other
systems
said
bailey
for
pacs
social
media
platforms
and
news
organizations
the
firm
has
observed
that
actors
target
and
try
to
obtain
info
for
hack
and
leak
campaigns
and
attempts
to
sway
public
opinion
she
said
the
need
for
voting
machines
with
paper
ballot
backups
was
stressed
by
many
speakers
including
chris
krebs
director
of
the
cybersecurity
and
infrastructure
security
agency
cisa
the
recently
created
federal
agency
under
dhs
tasked
with
protecting
the
nation's
critical
infrastructure
in
the
obama
administration
designated
election
systems
as
critical
infrastructure
offering
additional
levels
of
federal
protection
i
want
the
receipts
said
krebs
i
like
the
physical
i
want
the
ability
to
go
back
and
touch
the
ballots
krebs
also
warned
that
the
recent
spike
in
ransomware
attacks
could
extend
to
internet-connected
voter
registration
databases
while
states
have
fallback
plans
including
same-day
registration
in
some
states
it
could
cause
some
confusion
and
delay
at
the
polls
federal
agencies
states
local
municipalities
private
companies
and
academic
researchers
are
sharing
information
while
respecting
each
others
roles
and
responsibilities
in
a
completely
new
way
since
participants
stressed
a
vast
improvement
sometimes
that
response
could
even
include
u.s.
forces
acting
on
intelligence
to
stop
threats
from
malicious
actors
before
they
reach
the
homeland
said
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
describing
an
aggressive
cybersecurity
doctrine
termed
defending
forward
by
the
defense
department
during
the
recent
midterm
elections
a
newly
empowered
u.s.
cyber
command
temporarily
cut
off
the
internet
access
for
the
internet
research
agency
the
kremlin-linked
troll
farm
that
spread
millions
of
divisive
messages
using
false
online
personas
before
during
and
after
the
previous
presidential
election
it
was
a
warning
sign
and
a
proof
of
concept
just
as
we
do
on
land
at
sea
and
in
the
air
we
must
posture
our
forces
in
cyberspace
where
we
can
most
effectively
accomplish
our
mission
defending
forward
allows
us
to
disrupt
threats
at
the
initial
source
before
they
reach
our
networks
and
systems
that's
music
to
the
ears
of
the
states
and
localities
in
charge
of
actually
running
the
elections
defend
forward
to
me
that
sounds
like
offense
said
west
virginia
secretary
of
state
mac
warner
states
which
have
the
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
to
determine
the
time
place
and
manner
of
their
elections
unless
congress
legislates
otherwise
have
found
themselves
thrust
to
the
front
lines
of
defending
against
dedicated
malicious
hackers
backed
by
the
overwhelming
resources
of
adversarial
foreign
governments
the
u.s.
is
finally
taking
some
offensive
operations
for
what
happened
in
said
warner
that
was
the
first
good
news
to
hear
basic
and
cheap
cybersecurity
practices
can
go
quite
a
long
way
to
limit
many
cyberattack
risks
participants
said
that
can
include
using
physical
key
two-factor
authentication
across
equipment
and
accounts
including
front-facing
websites
and
social
media
communication
accounts
the
challenge
is
getting
that
message
down
to
and
executed
across
the
more
than
election
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states
the
event
billed
as
the
