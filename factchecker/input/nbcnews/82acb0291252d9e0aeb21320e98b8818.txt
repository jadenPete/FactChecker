for
possibly
violating
foreign
lobbying
rules
for
work
on
a
ukrainian
public
relations
campaign
organized
by
manafort
federal
prosecutors
have
ended
an
investigation
into
democratic
lobbyist
tony
podesta
and
former
rep
vin
weber
r-minn
in
a
case
connected
to
lobbying
for
ukraine
and
paul
manafort
without
filing
criminal
charges
multiple
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
tell
nbc
news
the
investigation
by
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
focused
on
whether
several
prominent
washington
lobbyists
violated
foreign
lobbying
rules
grew
out
of
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
inquiry
into
the
finances
of
manafort
a
former
trump
campaign
chairman
who
is
now
serving
a
year
sentence
in
federal
prison
manafort
had
organized
a
public
relations
campaign
for
a
nonprofit
called
the
european
centre
for
a
modern
ukraine
which
promoted
ukraine's
image
in
the
west
from
to
podesta's
democratic-leaning
lobbying
firm
the
podesta
group
was
one
of
many
firms
that
worked
on
the
campaign
including
weber's
firm
mercury
public
affairs
nbc
news
was
the
first
to
report
in
that
podesta
and
his
firm
had
been
ensnared
in
mueller's
probe
because
of
their
work
on
the
campaign
podesta
is
the
chairman
of
the
podesta
group
and
the
brother
of
john
podesta
who
was
hillary
clinton's
presidential
campaign
chairman
john
podesta
has
not
been
affiliated
with
the
podesta
group
since
the
s
and
was
not
a
subject
of
the
investigation
both
firms
were
being
investigated
for
possibly
failing
to
file
foreign
agents
registration
act
reports
for
their
work
with
the
ecmu
and
on
behalf
of
ukraine
nbc
news
has
previously
reported
according
to
an
october
indictment
the
two
lobbying
firms
were
paid
million
from
offshore
accounts
controlled
by
manafort
for
their
work
on
the
campaign
in
a
statement
to
nbc
news
vin
weber's
attorney
said
they
had
been
notified
the
investigation
was
over
as
we
have
previously
stated
at
all
times
mr
weber
acted
in
good
faith
and
in
keeping
with
the
legal
advice
his
company
received
from
its
outside
counsel
weber's
attorney
robert
trout
said
we
are
obviously
pleased
by
this
development
trout
added
podesta
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
spokesperson
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
declined
to
comment
the
dropping
of
the
investigation
comes
on
the
heels
of
the
not
guilty
verdict
in
the
trial
of
former
obama
white
house
counsel
greg
craig
another
case
that
mueller's
office
had
passed
to
federal
prosecutors
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
that
case
the
new
york
attorneys
decided
not
to
prosecute
sources
said
and
the
case
was
ultimately
brought
by
federal
prosecutors
in
washington
only
to
result
in
an
acquittal
for
craig
several
people
briefed
on
the
podesta
and
weber
probe
told
nbc
news
they
thought
that
the
investigation
into
the
two
lobbyists
had
a
better
chance
of
succeeding
than
the
probe
into
craig
but
in
the
end
the
legal
hurdles
would've
been
too
high
