biden's
smaller
events
what
crowd
size
can
tell
you
the
headcount
in
early-voting

doesn't
always
indicate
who's

joe
biden
recently
spoke
to
a
crowd
of
some
people
at
the
grass
wagon
a
warehouse
event
space
here
but
just
a
few
weeks
earlier
another
top
contender
elizabeth
warren
packed
more
than
into
the
same
spot
around
the
same
time
in
des
moines
a
more
intimate
crowd
of
about
people
stood
in
the
platinum
signature
barbershop
to
hear
cory
booker
hoarsely
deliver
his
stump
speech
as
attendees
chowed
on
locally
prepared
barbecue
the
new
jersey
senator
closed
out
the
event
with
an
impromptu
charity
drive
shaving
three
people's
heads
and
personally
donating
to
others
non-profit
of
choice
in
an
era
where
president
donald
trump
has
made
crowd
size
a
proxy
for
popularity
and
as
he
continues
to
boast
on
social
media
of
his
power
to
draw
vast
throngs
the
democrats
running
to
challenge
him
in
vary
widely
in
their
approach
to
conducting
campaign
events
and
building
crowds
while
some
like
warren
and
fellow
progressive
bernie
sanders
clearly
thrive
at
large
rallies
others
including
biden
mostly
draw
smaller
gatherings
it's
in
settings
like
this
those
campaigns
say
that
voter
interaction
happens
best
crowds
give
you
first
and
foremost
a
snapshot
of
the
energy
in
a
campaign
said
matt
paul
who
ran
hillary
clinton's
winning
iowa
caucus
effort
in
not
just
are
they
attracting
large
crowds
but
are
those
crowds
enthused
are
they
responding
to
the
key
messages
from
the
candidate
warren's
crowds
have
been
growing
bigger
still
as
polls
show
her
candidacy
gaining
steam
she
held
a
rally
in
new
york's
famed
washington
square
park
with
a
crowd
estimated
at
people
and
then
stayed
four
hours
more
to
pose
for
photos
with
people
who
lined
up
after
the
speech
the
selfie
line
has
become
a
distinguishing
feature
of
warren's
campaign
appearances
warren's
crowds
have
caught
trump's
attention
they
do
stories
so
big
on
elizabeth
pocahontas
warren's
crowd
sizes
adding
many
more
people
than
are
actually
there
and
yet
my
crowds
which
are
far
bigger
get
no
coverage
at
all
fake
news
he
tweeted
last
month
large
crowds
of
course
don't
always
predict
a
winning
candidacy
in
clinton
outpaced
sanders
for
the
democratic
nomination
even
though
the
vermont
senator
consistently
drew
bigger
crowds
but
clinton
went
on
to
lose
to
trump
in
the
general
election
having
never
attracted
the
kind
of
enthusiastic
turnout
to
her
rallies
that
trump
or
sanders
drew
to
theirs
biden's
team
insists
his
relatively
modest
crowds
are
mostly
by
design
our
campaign
aims
for
a
sweet
spot
of
attendees
so
that
the
vp
can
personally
connect
with
every
voter
in
the
room
said
julia
krieger
biden's
iowa
communications
director
that
sweet
spot
usually
falls
between
attendees
which
typically
limits
the
level
of
excitement
compared
to
the
crowds
of
thousands
warren
often
attracts
yet
warren's
photo
lines
in
which
supporters
sometimes
wait
for
hours
for
a
selfie
with
the
candidate
help
bring
a
measure
of
intimacy
to
her
large
rallies
paul
noted
it's
giving
her
direct
time
with
key
voters
to
hear
from
them
to
engage
with
them
directly
and
that's
important
and
personalizes
these
large
events
he
said
biden
campaign
aides
can
sound
defensive
when
discussing
crowd
size
there
is
often
an
implicit
suggestion
that
because
voters
believe
joe
biden
is
the
most
electable
democratic
candidate
that
there
is
not
also
genuine
and
passionate
support
for
his
candidacy
and
his
message
it's
wrong
one
senior
biden
official
told
nbc
news
the
official
said
that
what
biden
may
lack
in
crowd
size
is
made
up
for
in
voter
enthusiasm
measured
not
only
by
head
count
but
also
by
polling
across
demographics
especially
among
african
americans
enthusiasm
can't
be
defined
just
by
who
excites
white
progressives
the
official
said
engaging
with
various
voter
blocs
strategists
say
is
more
important
than
the
attendees
who
show
up
in
any
particular
room
older
people
for
instance
vote
in
large
numbers
relative
to
other
populations
but
may
be
less
likely
to
come
to
campaign
rallies
as
you're
looking
at
the
crowd
sizes
and
the
energy
that's
there
you
should
also
be
looking
at
who's
not
there
paul
said
what
voters
aren't
you
reaching
how
does
that
sync
up
with
the
research
and
the
polling
and
the
focus
groups
that
you're
doing
sanders
for
his
part
has
altered
his
approach
to
crowds
compared
with
in
addition
to
large
rallies
exemplified
by
a
recent
crowd
of
more
than
in
denver
the
candidate
balances
the
variety
of
events
often
attending
casual
backyard
ice
cream
socials
and
smaller
town
halls
their
goal
is
to
drill
down
on
issues
affecting
specific
communities
and
allow
for
more
audience
engagement
another
contender
kamala
harris
curates
her
crowd
sizes
around
time
of
day
the
campaign
will
often
host
medium-sized
events
of
people
or
less
during
the
day
saving
larger
rallies
for
evenings
when
more
voters
are
able
to
attend
juli
n
castro
among
others
tries
to
build
crowds
on
the
sidelines
of
multi-candidate
cattle
calls
in
the
early-voting
states
his
crowd
numbers
have
grown
over
time
but
are
often
connected
to
a
larger
event
like
a
state
labor
convention
which
attract
hundreds
of
attendees
booker
goes
for
small
to
mid-size
events
overall
we
want
voters
to
walk
away
having
met
cory
booker's
iowa
state
director
mike
frosolone
told
nbc
news
whenever
cory
has
a
chance
to
speak
one
on
one
or
in
smaller
groups
we
see
folks
sign
on
to
the
campaign
the
biggest
thing
is
that
we
see
crowds
grow
over
time
and
that's
absolutely
what's
happening
for
us
pete
buttigieg
who
was
all
but
unknown
to
most
voters
just
months
ago
has
attracted
good-sized
crowds
that
continue
to
grow
the
south
bend
mayor
started
off
hosting
modest
gatherings
in
backyards
across
iowa
and
his
appearances
lately
turn
out
numbers
in
the
hundreds
while
the
buttigieg
campaign
still
emails
tweets
and
calls
voters
to
invite
them
to
events
his
campaign
strategists
say
crowd
size
isn't
their
main
focus
our
field
organization
isn't
about
building
crowds
said
brendan
mcphillips
buttigieg's
iowa
state
director
it's
about
capturing
the
crowds
when
they
show
up
and
getting
them
plugged
into
our
organizing
program
andrew
yang
has
largely
relied
on
digital
tools
to
produce
real-world
crowds
the
entrepreneur's
supporters
who
call
themselves
the
yang
gang
largely
came
together
on
social
media
platforms
and
via
joe
rogan's
podcast
which
is
popular
among
reddit
and
chan
users
yang
drew
a
young
and
diverse
audience
of
people
at
a

party
in
north
hampton
new
hampshire
in
august
far
outpacing
many
other
candidates
at
similar
events
in
the
granite
state
while
iowa
new
hampshire
and
other
states
that
vote
early
in
the
calendar
naturally
draw
most
candidate
visits
places
that
don't
get
the
first
in
the
nation
treatment
are
eager
to
see
the

warren
