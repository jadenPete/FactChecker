washington
president
donald
trump
now
has
three
gop
primary
challengers
but
they
won't
be
given
a
chance
to
compete
in
at
least
four
states
after
republicans
there
decided
to
scrap
their
presidential
nominating
contests
in
favor
of
supporting
trump
the
republican
parties
of
nevada
and
south
carolina
both
crucial
early
nominating
states
voted
this
weekend
not
to
hold
contests
as
did
kansas
and
arizona
with
no
legitimate
primary
challenger
and
president
trump's
record
of
results
the
decision
was
made
to
save
south
carolina
taxpayers
over
million
and
forgo
an
unnecessary
primary
south
carolina
gop
chairman
drew
mckissick
said
in
a
statement
president
trump
and
his
administration
have
delivered
for
south
carolinians
and
we
look
forward
to
ensuring
that
republican
candidates
up
and
down
the
ballot
are
elected
in
south
carolina's
move
is
an
attempt
to
sideline
the
state's
former
republican
governor
mark
sanford
who
on
sunday
declared
his
intention
to
challenge
the
president
in
the
gop
primary
also
in
the
running
against
trump
are
former
illinois

trump
was
asked
monday
if
he
would
debate
any
of
his
republican
rivals
i
don't
know
them
the
president
responded
i
would
say
this
they
are
all
at
less
than
percent
i
guess
it's
a
publicity
stunt
we
just
got
a
little
while
ago
a
poll
showing
percent
popularity
or
approval
within
the
republican
party
so
to
be
honest
i'm
not
looking
to
get
them
any
credibility
they
have
no
credibility
he
added
one
was
a
person
that
voted
for
obama
ran
as
a
vice
president
four
years
ago
and
was
soundly
defeated
another
one
got
thrown
out
after
one
term
in
congress
and
he
lost
in
a
landslide
and
the
third
one
mr
appalachian
trail
he
wasn't
on
the
appalachian
trial
he
was
in
argentina
sanford
a
conservative
who
clashed
with
trump
when
he
served
in
congress
said
on
msnbc
on
monday
that
he's
running
because
republicans
have
turned
their
back
on
their
values
in
favor
of
personal
allegiance
to
trump
right
now
the
sun
moon
and
stars
too
often
basically
orbit
around
donald
trump
sanford
said
of
the
attitude
of
the
gop
and
if
it's
not
personal
allegiance
to
him
not
issue
allegiance
or
idea
allegiance
but
if
it's
not
personal
allegiance
it's
not
good
enough
sanford
said
he
would
consider
legal
or
other
challenges
to
south
carolina
gop's
action
but
acknowledged
his
entire
campaign
is
an
uphill
battle
against
the
incumbent
trump
fired
back
at
sanford
by
bringing
up
his
much-publicized
infidelity
scandal
and
knocked
the
three
stooges
running
against
him
as
a
all
badly
failed
candidates
republicans
pushed
back
on
the
idea
that
there
was
anything
unusual
about
the
state
parties
decisions
to
scrap
primaries
and
caucuses
noting
that
both
parties
have
made
similar
moves
when
they
have
incumbent
presidents
up
for
re-election
these
are
decisions
made
entirely
by
state
parties
and
there
are
volumes
of
historical
precedents
to
support
them
said
trump
campaign
communications
director
tim
murtaugh
nevertheless
president
trump
will
dominate
and
prevail
in
whatever
contest
is
placed
before
him
but
in
most
recent
cases
that
the
trump
campaign
cited
such
as
barack
obama's
re-election
in
there
was
no
declared
primary
challenger
to
the
incumbent
in
contrast
trump
now
has
three
rivals
who
have
served
in
the
top-levels
of
elective
office
in
nevada
the
state's
gop
at
a
convention
saturday
also
decided
to
forgo
their
caucus
which
typically
comes
right
after
iowa
and
new
hampshire
in
the
nominating
calendar
it
would
be
malpractice
on
my
part
to
waste
money
on
a
caucus
to
come
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
president
trump
will
be
getting
all
our
delegates
in
charlotte
nevada
republican
party
chairman
michael
mcdonald
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
the
city
where
the
republican
national
convention
will
be
held
next
year
kansas
gop
also
came
to
the
same
decision
on
friday
the
kansas
republican
party
will
not
organize
a
caucus
for
the
election
because
president
donald
trump
is
an
elected
incumbent
from
the
republican
party
the
party
announced
on
twitter
the
state
party
estimated
it
would
cost
to
hold
the
presidential
caucus
and
said
the
money
could
be
better
spent
on
contesting
tough
races
arizona
republican
party
chairman
kelli
ward
made
a
similar
argument
after
his
party
also
voted
this
weekend
to
nix
their
primary
this
is
nothing
new
despite
the
media's
inauthentic
attempt
to
portray
it
as
such
ward
said
referring
to
other
times
parties
with
incumbent
presidents
have
forgone
primaries
arizona
republicans
are
fired
up
to
re-elect
president
trump
to
a
second
term
and
will
continue
to
work
together
to
keep
america
and
arizona
great
more
states
could
follow
as
they
set
their
presidential
nominating
plans
for
the
future
but
iowa
and
new
hampshire
the
two
most
important
states
in
the
nominating
process
are
planning
to
go
ahead
with
their
contests
iowa
gop
chairman
jeff
kaufmann
told
radio
iowa
that
state
party
leaders
have
never
considered
canceling
their
famed
caucus
new
hampshire's
first-in-the-nation
primary
meanwhile
is
governed
by
state
law
not
the
parties
so
there
wouldn't
an
option
for
new
hampshire
to
cancel

sweeney
