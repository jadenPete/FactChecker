arguing
that
it's
misusing

and
unfairly
promote
the
positive
aspects
of

not

orders
the

for

to
revise
its
offerings
by

or
risk
losing
future
funding
from
a
federal
grant
that's
awarded
to
dozens
of
universities
to
support
foreign

instruction
the
consortium
received
from
the
grant
last
year
according
to
education
department
data
a
statement
from
the
unc-chapel
hill
says
the
consortium
deeply
values
its
partnership
with
the
department
of
education
and
is
committed
to
working
with
the
department
to
provide
more
information
about
its
programs
officials
at
duke
declined
to
comment
the
education
department
declined
to
say
if
it's
examining
similar
programs
at
other
schools
academic
freedom
advocates
say
the
government
could
be
setting
a
dangerous
precedent
if
it
injects
politics
into
funding
decisions
some
said
they
had
never
heard
of
the
education
department
asserting
control
over
such
minute
details
of
a
program's
offerings
is
the
government
now
going
to
judge
funding
programs
based
on
the
opinions
of
instructors
or
the
approach
of
each
course
said
henry
reichman
chairman
of
a
committee
on
academic
freedom
for
the
american
association
of
university
professors
the
odor
of
right
wing
political
correctness
that
comes
through
this
definitely
could
have
a
chilling
effect
more
than
a
dozen
universities
receive
national
resource
center
grants
for
their
middle
east
programs
including
columbia
georgetown
yale
and
the
university
of
texas
the
duke-unc
consortium
was
founded
in
and
first
received
the
grant
nearly
a
decade
ago
education
secretary
betsy
devos
ordered
an
investigation
into
the
program
in
june
after
north
carolina
rep
george
holding
a
republican
complained
that
it
hosted
a
taxpayer-funded
conference
with
severe
anti-israeli
bias
and
anti-semitic
rhetoric
the
conference
titled
conflict
over
gaza
people
politics
and
possibilities
included
a
rapper
who
performed
a
brazenly
anti-semitic
song
holding
said
in
an
april
letter
in
a
response
devos
said
she
was
troubled
by
holding's
letter
and
would
take
a
closer
look
at
the
consortium
the
inquiry
joins
a
broader
education
department
effort
to
root
out
anti-semitism
at
u.s.
universities
speaking
at
a
summit
on
the
topic
in
july
devos
attacked
a
movement
to
boycott
israel
over
its
treatment
of
palestinians
calling
it
a
pernicious
threat
on
college
campuses
last
year
the
department
reopened
an
investigation
at
rutgers
university
in
which
an
outside
group
was
accused
of
charging
jewish
attendees
for
admission
while
allowing
others
in
for
free
in
the
unc-duke
case
the
department's
findings
did
not
directly
address
any
bias
against
israel
but
instead
evaluated
whether
the
consortium's
proposed
activities
met
the
goals
of
the
national
resource
center
program
which
was
created
in
to
support
language
and
culture
initiatives
that
prepare
students
for
careers
in
diplomacy
and
national
security
investigators
concluded
that
the
consortium
intended
to
use
federal
money
on
offerings
that
are
plainly
unqualified
for
taxpayer
support
adding
that
foreign
language
and
national
security
instruction
have
taken
a
back
seat
to
other
priorities
the
department
cited
several
courses
conferences
and
academic
papers
that
it
says
have
little
or
no
relevance
to
the
grant's
goals
although
a
conference
focused
on
love
and
desire
in
modern
iran
and
one
focused
on
middle
east
film
criticism
may
be
relevant
in
academia
we
do
not
see
how
these
activities
support
the
development
of
foreign
language
and
international
expertise
for
the
benefit
of
u.s.
national
security
and
economic
stability
the
letter
said
investigators
also
saw
a
disconnect
between
the
grant's
mission
and
some
academic
papers
by
scholars
at
the
consortium
they
objected
to
one
paper
titled
performance
gender-bending
and
subversion
in
the
early
modern
ottoman
intellectual
history
and
another
titled
radical
love
teachings
from
islamic
mystical
tradition
the
letter
accused
the
consortium
of
failing
to
provide
a
balance
of
perspectives
on
religion
it
said
there
is
a
considerable
emphasis
placed
on
understanding
the
positive
aspects
of
islam
while
there
is
an
absolute
absence
of
any
similar
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
christianity
judaism
or
any
other
religion
or
belief
system
in
the
middle
east
it
added
that
there
are
few
offerings
on
discrimination
faced
by
religious
minorities
in
the
middle
east
including
christians
jews
baha'is
yadizis
kurds
druze
and
others
department
officials
said
the
grant's
rules
require
programs
to
provide
a
full
understanding
of
the
regions
they
study
jay
smith
a
history
professor
at
unc
and
vice
president
of
its
chapter
of
the
american
association
of
university
professors
said
the
letter
amounts
to
ideologically
driven
harassment
he
said
the
education
department
official
who
signed
the
letter
robert
king
should
stay
in
his
lane
and
allow
the
experts
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
full
understanding
of
the
middle
east
but
holding
the
republican
who
sparked
the
investigation
said
it's
clear
the
consortium
stepped
outside
the
bounds
of
the
grant
the
education
department
has
an
obligation
to
ensure
its
funding
is
used
as
intended
he
said
adding
that
other
schools
should
make
sure
they're
following
the
rules
this
has
fallen
through
the
cracks
and
this
could
be
going
on
at
other
educational
institutions
he
said
in
an
interview
if
the
department's
providing
the
money
and
giving
guidance
on
how
the
money
is
to
be
used
i
think
they
can
be
as
in
the
weeds
as
they
need
to
be
the
national
resource
center
grant
program
provided
a
total
of
million
to
language
programs
at
about
universities
last
year
of
that
total
about
million
was
for
middle
east
programs
along
with
its
objection
to
the
nature
of
the
unc-duke
offerings
the
department
also
said
it
is
concerned
that
out
of
students
enrolled
in
the
consortium's
courses
just
were
enrolled
in
middle
east
language
classes
and
that
only
of
the
program's
graduates
pursue
careers
in
government
while
takes
jobs
in
academia
department
officials
instructed
the
consortium
to
provide
a
revised
schedule
of
activities
for
the
next
year
and
to
explain
how
each
offering
promotes
foreign
language
learning
and
advances
national
security
interest
