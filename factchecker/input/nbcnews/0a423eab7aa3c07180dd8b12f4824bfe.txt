the
democrats
trump
challenge
analysis
the
president
has
honed
clear
sharp
lines
of
attack
on
his
rivals
they're
still
figuring
out
the
best
way
to
land
return
punches
the
thursday
night
campaign
trail
was
a
tale
of
two
cities
houston
where
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
battled
in
their
third
debate
and
baltimore
where
the
man
they're
running
to
beat
had
the
stage
all
to
himself
at
roughly
the
same
time
the
democratic
faceoff
began
president
donald
trump
strode
into
a
republican
gathering
halfway
across
the
country
unashamed
to
show
up
in
a
city
he'd
called
rat-infested
a
few
weeks
ago
and
launched
into
well-honed
attacks
on
his
would-be
replacements
he
trotted
out
the
set
of
derogatory
nicknames
he's
rolled
out
over
months
of
re-election
rallies
sleepy
joe
pocahontas
crazy
bernie
while
warning
that
a
grim
specter
of
socialism
is
descending
on
the
democrat
party
full
of
radicals
who
will
destroy
america's
economic
and
physical
security
it
was
a
well-practiced
performance
honed
over
more
than
a
year
of
repetition
the
same
one-liners
the
same
personal
insults
and
policy
barbs
meanwhile
in
houston
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
democratic
debate
the
candidates
struggled
to
figure
out
who
their
main
opponent
was
they
battled
each
other
over
health
care
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
echoing
trump's
narrative
that
the
universal
health
care
plan
advocated
by
several
candidates
would
cause
millions
of
people
to
lose
their
private
health
insurance
boosting
the
tax
burden
for
working
americans
that's
a
reality
biden
said
now
it's
not
a
bad
idea
if
you
like
it
i
don't
like
it
the
split
screen
highlighted
the
challenge
democrats
face
as
they
seek
a
solid
strategy
to
beat
trump
despite
the
primary
season
reality
that
the
only
way
to
become
their
party's
nominee
is
to
score
points
against
one
another
whether
or
not
the
president's
message
is
effective
he
seems
to
have
settled
on
it
even
without
knowing
exactly
whom
his
opponent
will
be
democrats
face
the
opposite
challenge
they
know
who
they'll
need
to
beat
after
they
vanquish
one
another
they
just
haven't
decided
precisely
the
best
way
to
take
him
on
or
how
to
battle
one
another
without
occasionally
echoing
the
incumbent's
attacks
it
wasn't
that
democrats
didn't
have
plenty
of
criticism
for
trump
at
thursday
night's
debate
they
just
struggled
throughout
the
night
to
find
a
clear
focused
unified
line
of
attack
against
him
while
clashing
amid
the
early
sparring
over
health
care
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
zeroed
in
on
the
field's
joint
challenge
directing
the
conversation
back
to
the
president
they
were
auditioning
to
replace
here's
the
thing
everybody
on
this
stage
i
do
believe
is
well
intentioned
and
wants
that
all
americans
have
coverage
and
recognizes
that
right
now
million
americans
don't
have
coverage
she
said
but
at
least
five
people
have
talked
some
repeatedly
on
this
subject
and
not
once
have
we
talked
about
donald
trump
others
on
stage
sounded
similar
concerns
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
and
that
is
not
how
we're
going
to
win
this
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
said
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
appealed
to
party
spirit
look
everyone
we
know
we're
on
the
same
team
here
we
know
we're
on
the
same
team
we
all
have
a
better
vision
for
health
care
than
our
current
president
he
said
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
warned
that
shots
taken
now
could
do
damage
next
year
this
must
be
a
moment
where
we
as
democrats
can
begin
to
show
that
we
cannot
only
stake
and
stand
our
ground
but
find
common
ground
because
we've
got
one
shot
to
make
donald
trump
a
one-term
president
he
said
and
we
cannot
lose
it
by
the
way
we
talk
about
each
other
or
demonize
and
degrade
each
other
we
can
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the
same
time
after
the
pack
decided
to
focus
more
of
their
fire
on
trump
than
on
one
another
they
lobbed
more
than
two
dozen
different
lines
of
attack
against
the
president
accusing
him
of
everything
from
racism
and
inciting
violence
to
being
generally
clueless
on
trade
immigration
and
national
security
on
immigration
former
obama
secretary
for
housing
and
urban
development
juli
n
castro
said
the
president
has
a
dark
heart
on
the
issue
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
indiana
said
anyone
who
supports
trump's
agenda
on
immigration
is
supporting
racism
but
on
pocketbook
issues
such
as
trade
their
contrast
message
was
less
clear
despite
criticism
of
trump's
approach
on
tariffs
some
contenders
would
not
say
they
planned
to
immediately
eliminate
them
with
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
and
yang
saying
they
wouldn't
repeal
all
the
trade
penalties
right
away
buttigieg
mocked
trump's
inability
to
get
a
deal
done
with
china
you
know
when
i
first
got
into
this
race
i
remember
president
trump
scoffed
and
said
he'd
like
to
see
me
making
a
deal
with
xi
jinping
i'd
like
to
see
him
making
a
deal
with
xi
jinping
buttigieg
said
is
it
just
me
or
was
that
supposed
to
happen
in
like
april
in
baltimore
trump
had
his
own
mocking
jabs
ready
on
the
same
situation
he
again
acted
out
an
imaginary
negotiating
session
with
the
chinese
leader
to
make
the
case
that
he
was
the
leader
best-suited
for
the
role
xi
he
said
was
a
furious
kind
of
a
guy
great
guy
he's
dying
to
see
he
wants
sleepy
joe
here's
sleepy
joe
wha
where
am
i
where
am
i
he
said
trying
to
imitate
biden
discussing
a
potential
deal
xi
said
trump
would
just
say
just
sign
here
sleepy
joe
democrats
have
appeared
focused
on
proving
they're
not
merely
running
as
a
field
of
anti-trumps
that
their
trail
priority
is
providing
an
alternative
policy
vision
they're
far
more
likely
to
attack
the
agenda
they'd
like
to
dismantle
than
the
president
behind
it
in
the
third
round
of
the
democratic
debate
season
this
translated
into
far
more
narrow
hits
on
policy
differences
and
value
gaps
with
the
current
commander
in
chief
than
broadsides
addressing
the
whirlwind
of
chaos
and
dysfunction
that
has
characterized
much
of
trump's
white
house
tenure
in
houston
there
was
little
to
no
mention
of
complaints
that
the
president
may
be
profiting
from
his
office
in
unprecedented
ways
or
of
the
congressional
push
to
hold
him
accountable
of
the
regulatory
rollbacks
benefiting
many
of
trump's
industry
supporters
or
of
the
russian
efforts
to
aid
his
last
campaign
and
his
seeming
indifference
to
the
prospect
that
they
might
do
so
again
across
the
country
it
was
clear
that
trump
had
taken
a
sharply
different
approach
deciding
he
doesn't
need
to
know
which
candidate
he'll
face
to
make
the
race
a
personal
one
and
paint
a
dire
picture
of
who
they
are
or
what
they'd
do
and
just
how
they'd
fall
short
in
the
race
against
him
next
year
democrats
have
embraced
a
dangerous
agenda
radical
socialism
and
open
borders
trump
told
gop
lawmakers
as
his
rivals
faced
off
democrats
are
determined
to
replicate
the
most
catastrophic
failures
of
world
history
right
here
in
the
united
states
on
thursday
the
president
was
already
looking
past
that
night's
debate
stage
to
the
one
where
he'll
face
the
democratic
nominee
next
fall
as
they
hit
me
left
and
right
i'll
say
african
american
unemployment
is
the
lowest
it's
ever
been
and
just
leave
the
stage
and
say
thank
you
very
much
good
luck
he
said
drawing
laughs
and
applause
from
republican
lawmakers
i
mean
how
do
you
lose
this
debate
how
do
you
lose
this
debate
that's
a
tough
one
to
beat
