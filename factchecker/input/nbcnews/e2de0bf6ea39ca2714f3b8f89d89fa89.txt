the
democratic
party
is
still
barack
obama's
party
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
if
you
spend
enough
time
on
twitter
or
read
enough
opinion
columns
from
the
left
you
might
get
the
impression
that
democrats
and
progressives
have
grown
dissatisfied
with
barack
obama
and
his
presidency
but
that
impression
distorts
the
actual
reality
in
the
latest
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
a
whopping
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
said
they
were
satisfied
that
obama's
presidency
did
as
much
as
was
possible
at
the
time
in
addressing
the
issues
facing
the
country
that's
compared
with
percent
who
said
they
were
not
satisfied
because
more
should
have
been
done
even
among
self-described
liberal
democrats
in
the
poll
the
numbers
are
essentially
the
same
percent
satisfied
percent
dissatisfied
what's
more
obama's
fav
unfav
rating
among
all
democratic
primary
voters
in
the
poll
is
percent
positive
percent
negative
so
you
now
know
why
democrats
have
gone
out
of
their
way
at
the
debates
to
praise
obama
like
elizabeth
warren
did
last
week
or
get
criticized
when
they
don't
this
isn't
to
say
that
democratic
primary
voters
want
their
presidential
nominee
to
pursue
obama's
same
policies
a
poll
from
fox
news
yesterday
found
percent
of
dem
voters
wanting
a
candidate
who
will
build
on
obama's
legacy
versus
percent
who
want
a
new
and
different
approach
but
if
you
believe
that
democratic
voters
don't
like
obama
or
don't
look
back
fondly
at
his
presidency
you're
greatly
mistaken
and
that's
going
to
be
one
of
the
central
dynamics
at
play
in
the
democratic
race
just
like
it
was
in
by
the
way
here's
the
democratic
horserace
in
the
nbc
wsj
poll
among
those
satisfied
with
obama's
presidency
joe
biden
percent
warren
percent
bernie
sanders
percent
and
here's
the
horserace
among
those
dissatisfied
with
obama
warren
percent
biden
percent
sanders
percent
as
tensions
and
violence
rise
in
the
middle
east
it's
worth
mapping
out
the
political
consequences
if
the
united
states
and
president
trump
take
action
against
iran
an
international
crisis
could
very
well
help
joe
biden
in
the
democratic
race
elevating
foreign
policy
and
experience
subjects
that
have
received
little
attention
so
far
yet
trump
not
taking
action
could
subject
him
to
criticism
within
his
own
party
remember
trump's
foreign-policy
instincts
especially
as
it
relates
to
war
in
the
middle
east
put
him
at
odds
with
much
of
the
interventionist
wing
of
the
republican
party
here's
the
story
that
has
everyone
in
washington
talking
today
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
an
intelligence
officer
that
the
trump
administration
is
withholding
from
congress
involves
a
phone
conversation
had
by
the
president
a
former
u.s.
intelligence
official
familiar
with
the
matter
confirmed
to
nbc
news
on
wednesday
night
nbc's
ken
dilanian
writes
more
the
washington
post
citing
two
former
u.s.
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
first
reported
that
the
complaint
was
by
an
intelligence
official
troubled
by
a
promise
trump
made
during
communication
and
interaction
with
a
foreign
leader
the
fact
that
the
complaint
had
been
filed
by
an
intelligence
official
was
known
but
the
subject
had
been
a
closely
guarded
secret
a
fox
news
poll
released
wednesday
shows
a
slightly
different
democratic
race
than
our
nbc

from

the

this
means
the
