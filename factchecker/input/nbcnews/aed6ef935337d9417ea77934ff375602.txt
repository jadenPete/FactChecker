of

response
drew
rebuke
online
the
exchange
took
place
at
a
friday
town
hall
in
new
hampshire
where
a
man
who
identified
himself
as
being
from
chennai
india
said
somehow
a
racist
bigot
gets
into
the
white
house
and
then
he
says
if
you're
not
my
color
you
need
to
go
back
to
your
own
country
so
i
am
scared
for
this
country
the
man
continued
i
am
scared
for
the
people
of
color
in
this
country
he
then
asked
what
harris
would
do
to
diminish
trump's
mentally
retarded
actions
the
crowd
applauded
the
answer
while
harris
laughed
and
said
well
said
well
said
i
plan
to
win
this
election
i'll
tell
you
that
harris
responded
it's
going
to
be
about
working
as
hard
as
i
possibly
can
to
get
there
because
over
the
course
of
this
next
year
that's
what
it's
going
to
take
to
unseat
him
thank
you
for
having
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
say
it
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
with
extreme
fear
right
now
in
our
country
extreme
fear
speaking
with
cbs
news
harris
denied
hearing
the
phrase
i
heard
him
talk
about
the
other
stuff
she
said
and
then
that
came
later
and
it
was
not
something
that
i
really
heard
or
processed
you
know
in
any
way
she
called
the
remark
incredibly
offensive
adding
that
you'd
assume
in
that
people
would
have
a
much
better
understanding
of
how
hurtful
a
term
like
that
can
be
