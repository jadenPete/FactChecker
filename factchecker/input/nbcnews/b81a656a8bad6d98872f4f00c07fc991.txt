share
this
five
takeaways
from
republicans
narrow
escape
in
north
carolina's
th
district
analysis
if
trump
were
to
replicate
dan
bishop's
performance
all
over
the
state
next
november
he'd
clearly
lose
north
carolina
republicans
narrowly
averted
disaster
on
tuesday
night
as
gop
state
sen
dan
bishop
eked
out
a
percent
to
percent
win
over
democrat
dan
mccready
in
north
carolina's
th
congressional
district
where
an
absentee
ballot
fraud
scandal
last
fall
required
a
new
election
but
tuesday's
results
were
nothing
to
brag
about
bishop
and
republican
groups
spent
over
million
to
barely
hang
onto
a
district
president
donald
trump
had
carried
by
points
bishop's
win
along
with
gop
state
rep
greg
murphy's
expected
victory
in
north
carolina's
rd
district
leaves
the
house
with
democrats
republicans
and
one
independent
rep
justin
amash
of
michigan
that
means
republicans
will
need
to
gain
seats
to
win
the
house
back
next
fall
a
task
made
more
difficult
by
gop
retirements
that
have
enhanced
democratic
pick-up
opportunities
especially
in
texas
here
are
five
takeaways
from
republicans
narrow
escape
in
north
carolina's
th
district
despite
the
president's
twitter
victory
lap
tuesday's
photo
finish
illustrates
that
the
political
environment
hasn't
gotten
much
better
for
republicans
since
the
midterms
bishop
lost
charlotte
suburbs
trump
had
carried
in
even
though
bishop
hails
from
those
suburbs
and
carried
them
on
his
way
to
re-election
to
the
state
senate
as
recently
as
last
fall
if
trump
were
to
replicate
bishop's
performance
all
over
the
state
next
november
he'd
clearly
lose
north
carolina
a
state
critical
to
his
re-election
path
it's
also
clear
that
to
match
his
success
trump
will
need
a
democratic
opponent
he
can
demonize
much
more
effectively
than
mccready
a
moderate
marine
corps
veteran
who
downplayed
social
issues
like
abortion
and
emphasized
high
prescription
drug
costs
although
a
loss
would
have
been
disastrous
for
gop
morale
bishop's
win
won't
do
anything
to
persuade
house
republicans
many
of
whom
are
on
the
fence
about
running
again
in
that
they're
in
position
to
take
back
control
next
year
according
to
the
cook
report's
partisan
voter
index
there
are
gop-held
seats
less
republican
than
north
carolina's
th
district
trump
held
an
election
eve
rally
for
bishop
in
fayetteville
but
bishop
still
underperformed
trump's
margin
in
the
district
by
points
it's
a
sign
that
just
as
in
many
trump
voters
aren't
jazzed
about
showing
up
for
down-ballot
gop
politicians
when
trump's
not
on
the
ballot
himself
the
silver
lining
for
red-seat
republicans
trump
will
be
back
on
the
ballot
next
fall
one
of
the
most
economically
distressed
places
in
north
carolina
is
robeson
county
home
to
the
lumbee
tribe
and
a
sixth
of
the
th
district's
population
by
party
registration
democrats
outnumber
republicans
by
a
massive
percent
to
percent
but
in
trump's
appeal
to
forgotten
america
helped
him
carry
the
county
by
points
in
robeson
county
reverted
to
form
voting
for
mccready
by
a
healthy
points
according
to
one
local
source
mccready
benefited
from
a
lumbee
democrat
running
for
the
state
house
on
the
same
ballot
last
fall
but
on
tuesday
mccready
won
robeson
county
by
just
point
potentially
costing
him
victory
an
analysis
by
j.
miles
coleman
showed
the
biggest
swing
occurred
in
heavily
lumbee
precincts
so
how
did
bishop
whose
charlotte-area
state
senate
district
is
nowhere
near
robeson
county
do
so
well
there
it
turns
out
that
in
march
when
bishop
was
just
launching
his
bid
for
the
do-over
congressional
election
he
sponsored
a
bill
to
open
more
grant
opportunities
for
the
lumbees
by
clarifying
state
recognition
of
the
tribe
bishop's
picture
appeared
in
the
robesonian
and
it
likely
paid
off
on
tuesday
mccready
exceeded
his
showing
in
the
charlotte
suburbs
of
mecklenburg
county
stretching
his
margin
from
to
points
and
he
matched
his
showing
in
union
county
which
contains
charlotte's
more
conservative
exurbs
but
in
the
six
more
rural
counties
mccready
underperformed
last
fall's
showing
significantly
this
widening
gap
is
the
same
pattern
we've
observed
in
virtually
every
house
special
election
held
in
the
past
five
years
and
it
suggests
that
is
likely
to
continue
that
trend
to
beat
trump
democrats
will
need
to
nominate
a
candidate
who
can
capitalize
on
the
president's
increasingly
toxic
standing
in
prosperous
suburbs
without
losing
too
many
small
town
and
rural
voters
like
those
in
robeson
county
