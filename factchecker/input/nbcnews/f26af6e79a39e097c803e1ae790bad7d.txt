this
booker's
history
with
devos
under
scrutiny
as
democrats
invoke
her
on
the
trail
while
other
candidates
pile
on
the
education
secretary
in
campaign
speeches
cory
booker
is
defending
his
past
ties
to
her
organization
washington
as
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
pile
on
education
secretary
betsy
devos
one
is
facing
new
scrutiny
over
his
past
ties
to
her
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
although
booker's
record
as
an
advocate
for
public
school
reform
has
long
been
known
his
past
work
with
devos
continues
to
dog
him
on
the
campaign
trail
as
democrats
invoke
her
name
with
more
and
more
frequency
turning
her
into
their
preferred
bogeyman
of
the
trump
cabinet
the
issue
has
put
booker
a
former
mayor
of
newark
new
jersey
in
the
position
of
defending
his
past
while
candidates
like
sens
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
and
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
are
emphasizing
their
pro-active
plans
on
education
and
public
schools
last
week
while
taking
questions
in
las
vegas
booker
was
confronted
by
the
vice
president
of
the
milwaukee
teachers
education
association
ingrid
walker
henry
who
accused
him
of
diverting
funding
away
from
public
schools
for
charter
schools
she
called
him
out
for
having
served
with
betsy
devos
on
the
board
of
directors
of
a
devos-affiliated
school
choice
organization
will
you
say
you've
been
wrong
walker
henry
asked
him
at
a
forum
hosted
by
the
working
families
party
booker
pushed
back
saying
much
of
what
has
been
said
about
his
record
on
the
issue
is
wrong
of
devos
he
said
he
was
on
the
senate
floor
fighting
against
her
nomination
in
i
sat
on
a
board
with
her
with
other
democrats
looking
for
solutions
and
i
will
never
fault
myself
for
trying
to
find
solutions
that
work
booker
said
but
from
iowa
to
new
hampshire
and
south
carolina
the
candidates
have
been
increasingly
turning
devos
name
into
a
proxy
for
incompetence
and
cronyism
in
the
trump
administration
although
other
trump
cabinet
chiefs
had
higher
profiles
before
entering
government
it's
devos
who
has
attracted
the
most
intense
ire
from
trump's
opponents
warren
calls
her
the
worst
education
secretary
ever
and
says
if
she
gets
to
pick
the
next
cabinet
devos
need
not
apply
beto
o'rourke
called
friday
to
replace
betsy
devos
while
sanders
likes
to
tell
voters
that
in
his
administration
we
will
no
longer
tolerate
billionaires
like
betsy
devos
mayor
pete
buttigieg's
standard
attack
on
devos
that
the
u.s.
needs
an
education
secretary
who
actually
believes
in
public
education
has
reliably
become
the
biggest
applause
line
of
his
entire
stump
speech
it's
such
a
crowd-pleaser
that
last
week
he
launched
facebook
ads
accusing
her
of
having
turned
her
back
on
lower-income
and
middle-class
americans
booker
as
a
presidential
candidate
has
been
sharply
critical
of
devos
and
when
the
senate
took
up
her
nomination
in
he
voted
against
her
citing
her
widely
criticized
performance
in
her
confirmation
hearing
and
her
policies
on
special
education
and
civil
rights
but
booker's
association
with
devos
and
the
pro-school-choice
organizations
she
had
spearheaded
actually
dates
back
nearly
two
decades
to
before
booker
became
mayor
of
newark
in
and
was
serving
on
the
city
council
a
decade
later
he
was
keynoting
the
annual
conference
for
the
devos-organized
american
federation
of
children
praising
the
group
effusively
as
friends
of
mine
who
were
there
for
me
in
some
of
my
darkest
hours
people
who
have
sustained
me
through
their
inspiration
people
who
instructed
me
through
their
example
i
kind
of
knew
that
this
was
going
to
be
preaching
to
the
choir
booker
then
in
his
third
term
as
mayor
said
at
the
may
dinner
the
folk
in
this
room
are
just
dedicated
many
of
you
veterans
in
the
effort
to
open
up
opportunities
for
all
children
in
america
the
unlikely
alliance
between
booker
and
devos
emerged
as
both
ascended
nationally
as
champions
of
school
choice
and
charter
schools
as
alternatives
to
chronically
underperforming
public
schools
booker
took
over
a
system
in
newark
so
deeply
troubled
and
for
so
long
that
the
state
had
taken
it
over
years
earlier
a
vocal
advocate
for
school
choice
in
those
years
booker
teamed
up
with
then-gov
chris
christie
and
facebook
founder
mark
zuckerberg
who
donated
million
to
improve
the
schools
in
new
jersey's
largest
city
at
the
same
time
devos
and
her
husband
amway
heir
dick
devos
were
investing
millions
into
national
organizations
to
advocate
for
school
choice
policies
across
the
country
including
state
laws
and
ballot
measures
to
expand
access
to
government
vouchers
to
attend
nonpublic
schools
those
efforts
elevated
them
as
key
enemies
of
teachers
unions
and
other
public
school
advocates
who
oppose
what
they
describe
as
the
draining
of
critical
funds
out
of
the
public
school
system
by
booker's
second
term
as
mayor
he
and
devos
were
serving
together
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
alliance
for
school
choice
a
group
closely
affiliated
with
the
american
federation
for
children
that
devos
later
chaired
and
in
when
booker
won
the
democratic
primary
in
his
first
race
for
the
senate
the
american
federation
for
children
put
out
a
press
release
congratulating
our
good
friend
cory
and
anointing
him
an
educational
choice
champion
three
years
later
he
returned
to
the
annual
event
for
the
american
federation
for
children
with
devos
now
serving
as
chairwoman
video
of
his
remarks
reviewed
by
nbc
news
show
he
lavished
praise
on
the
group
although
not
devos
by
name
the
mission
of
this
organization
is
aligned
with
the
mission
of
our
nation
booker
said
he
added
that
it
was
personal
saying
it
was
the
first
time
i've
been
able
to
come
back
to
this
incredible
organization
since
i've
been
elected
to
the
united
states
senate
there
are
some
people
in
this
room
who
really
were
the
difference
makers
as
i
was
climbing
the
ladder
in
newark
new
jersey
with
a
vision
for
transforming
that
city
booker
said
sabrina
singh
a
spokesperson
for
booker's
presidential
campaign
said
his
efforts
as
mayor
improved
newark's
schools
and
noted
he's
been
endorsed
in
the
past
by
the
new
jersey
education
association
the
state's
largest
teachers
union
unquestionably
newark's
kids
are
better
off
now
than
they
were
before
cory
booker
ran
toward
the
tough
challenge
of
turning
around
the
city's
failing
schools
singh
said
in
a
statement
singh
didn't
mention
booker's
past
relationship
with
devos
but
instead
pointed
to
his
refusal
to
support
her
as
education
secretary
cory
vocally
opposed
the
nomination
of
betsy
devos
as
secretary
of
education
and
has
remained
a
strong
critic
of
secretary
devos
and
the
trump
administration's
efforts
to
undermine
public
schools
and
public
school
educators
singh
said
devos
declined
to
comment
through
a
spokeswoman
these
days
booker
doesn't
regularly
bring
up
charter
schools
or
vouchers
controversial
topics
in
a
democratic
primary
where
other
candidates
are
focused
on
raising
up
traditional
public
schools
though
additional
federal
funding
higher
pay
for
teachers
and
expanded
access
to
special
education
and
early
childhood
programs
booker's
campaign
website
does
not
include
any
mention
of
the
word
charter
and
his
issues
page
focuses
on
the
need
to
pay
teachers
more
stop
republican
attacks
on
public
education
and
invest
in
our
schools
