share
this
nbc
wsj
poll
shows
both
biden
and
warren
building
formidable
coalitions
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
the
latest
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
survey
is
a
good
poll
for
only
two
democrats
joe
biden
and
elizabeth
warren
want
evidence
that
biden
is
more
durable
than
the
conventional
wisdom
suggests
well
he's
leading
the
democratic
horserace
at
percent
up
points
since
july
he
also
has
a
substantial
lead
with
african-american
democratic
primary
voters
and
he's
dominating
the
party's
moderate
conservative
smaller
change
lane
which
he
has
pretty
much
all
to
himself
want
evidence
that
warren
has
the
momentum
and
could
very
well
be
the
nominee
next
year
well
she's
on
biden's
heels
at
percent
up
points
since
two
months
ago
she
has
the
most
enthusiasm
around
her
percent
of
dem
primary
voters
say
they're
enthusiastic
about
voting
her
versus
biden's
percent
and
she
gets
the
most
second-choice
support
in
the
poll
suggesting
that
she
has
crossover
appeal
in
the
race
maybe
most
important
of
all
the
nbc
wsj
poll
shows
that
both
biden
and
warren
have
potentially
winning
coalitions
biden
enjoys
significant
advantages
with
african
americans
older
dem
primary
voters
those
traditionally
most
likely
to
show
up
and
moderates
and
conservatives
warren
on
the
other
hand
has
the
strong
edge
with
liberal
democrats
women
with
college
degrees
and
those
who
want
large-scale
change
bottom
line
you
can
make
the
case
that
either
is
the
frontrunner
right
now
to
win
the
dem
nomination
now
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
call
it
a
two-person
race
or
even
a
three-person
race
when
you
add
bernie
sanders
and
his
percent
support
as
our
poll
shows
only
percent
of
dem
primary
voters
have
definitely
made
up
their
minds
about
their
choice
so
these
numbers
aren't
set
in
stone
but
we
are
seeing
the
beginning
of
a
sorting
process
in
the
dem
race
with
older
more
moderate
and
african
american
voters
flocking
to
biden
and
with
liberals
women
and
the
college
educated
increasingly
breaking
warren's
way
even
with
days
until
iowa
that
sorting
process
is
hard
to
ignore
want
to
see
how
divided
democratic
primary
voters
are
by
age
well
joe
biden
is
the
first
choice
among
just
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
ages
versus
his
overall
percent
conversely
he
gets
percent
among
those
and
a
whopping
percent
among
those
and
older
meanwhile
bernie
sanders
is
at
percent
support
among
those
compared
with
his
overall
percent
but
he's
at
just
percent
among
those
and
percent
among
those
and
older
the
good
news
for
warren
in
this
poll
is
that
she
straddles
this
divide
getting
percent
among
those
percent
among
those
percent
among
those
and
another
percent
among
those
plus
no
matter
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
however
a
fight
over
the
direction
of
the
party
between
younger
and
older
voters
is
already
here
and
it
likely
will
only
intensify
it's
striking
that
what's
playing
out
after
israel's
election
yesterday
could
also
occur
in
november
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
appeared
to
fall
short
of
a
governing
majority
in
israel's
election
wednesday
raising
doubts
over
whether
he
could
maintain
his
decade-long
grip
on
power
per
nbc
news
early
wednesday
morning
netanyahu
refused
to
concede
defeat
and
vowed
to
form
a
new
government
that
excludes
arab
parties
facing
the
end
of
his
political
career
and
potentially
even
jail
netanyahu
pulled
out
all
the
stops
throughout
the
campaign
war
to
the
last
minute
he
said
on
twitter
on
tuesday
in
a
late
attempt
to
get
supporters
to
the
polls
we
will
lose
if
you
do
not
wake
up
of
course
don't
count
out
netanyahu
until
all
of
the
votes
have
been
counted
but
if
loses
it's
a
reminder
that
political
gravity
eventually
catches
up
to
everyone
the
other
big
finding
from
the
nbc
wsj
poll
was
kamala

to
peak
at

the
warmest

by

a

ovation

of
bernie
bernie
throughout
his
remarks
and
andrew

seemed
to
miss
the
mark
when
he
mentioned
uaw
a
number
of
times
as
if
to
build
a
relationship
with
people
in
the
crowd
however
there
are
no
uaw
members
here
as
afl-cio

uaw
are
totally
separate
entities
joe
biden
made
light
of
the
scrutiny
of
his
career
especially
about
the
length
of
his
political
career
biden
said
the
bad
news
is
i've
been
around
a
long
time
the
good
news
is
i've
been

a
long
time
you
all

i've
never
not
been
with
you
i've
never
not
taken
the
risk
of
being
with
you
bill

spoke
at

poll
for

is
very
positive
while
just

view
but
clinton
whose
presidency
is
now
being
viewed
through
more
modern
lenses
including
the
metoo
movement
and
the
fallout
from
his
anti-crime
reforms
hasn't
fared
as
well
just
percent
of
democratic

say
they
have
a
very
positive

of
