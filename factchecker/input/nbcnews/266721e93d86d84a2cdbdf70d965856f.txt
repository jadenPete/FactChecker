said
on

that
he
will
run
for

giving
president
donald
trump
another
longshot
primary
challenger
i
plan
to
announce
that
back
home
this
week
sanford
told
fox
news
sunday
host
chris
wallace
adding
but
i
am
here
to
tell
you
now
that
i
am
going
to
get
in
sanford
is
the
third
republican
to
announce
a
primary
challenge
to
trump
joining
former
rep
joe
walsh
r-ill
and
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
sanford
who
had
for
months
been
hinting
at
a
presidential
bid
said
he
is
going
to
run
because
i
think
we
need
to
have
a
conversation
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
republican
i
think
that
as
a
republican
party
we
have
lost
our
way
he
continued
and
i'd
say
so
on
a
couple
of
different
fronts
i'd
say
first
and
sort
of
the
epicenter
of
where
i'm
coming
from
is
that
we
have
lost
our
way
on
debt
and
deficits
and
spending
sanford
faces
an
uphill
battle
against
trump
who
enjoys
widespread
support
among
republican
voters
after
wallace
pointed
out
that
the
former
congressman
has
basically
no
shot
sanford
said
the
same
could've
been
said
for
trump
ahead
of
adding
you
never
know
what
could
happen
i'm
listing
my
goals
my
primary
goal
is
to
say
let's
go
out
and
force
or
try
and
create
a
conversation
on
that
which
is
not
being
talked
about
in
this
presidential
cycle
sanford
added
sanford
served
as
a
congressman
for
south
carolina's
st
congressional
district
from
and
again
from
he
served
as
the
state's
governor
from
where
he
faced
scandal
over
an
extramarital
affair
sanford
said
he
was
hiking
the
appalachian
trail
while
in
actuality
he
was
in
argentina
with
a
mistress
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
sanford
lost
a
reelection
bid
to
his
congressional
seat
after
trump
endorsed
south
carolina
state
rep
katie
arrington
who
won
the
primary
before
losing
the
race
to
now-rep
joe
cunningham
d-s
c.
sanford
and
trump
have
a
history
of
trading
barbs
can
you
believe
it
i'm
at
approval
in
the
republican
party
and
have
three
stooges
running
against
me
trump
tweeted
last
month
one
is
mr
appalachian
trail
who
was
actually
in
argentina
for
bad
reasons
another
is
a
one-time
bad
congressman
from
illinois
who
lost
in
his
second
term
by
a
landslide
then
failed
in
radio
the
third
is
a
man
who
couldn't
stand
up
straight
while
receiving
an
award
i
should
be
able
to
take
them
addressing
his
affair
sanford
said
he
learned
a
level
of
humility
a
level
of
empathy
that
i
didn't
have
before
a
level
of
judgment
in
its
aftermath
it
is
something
of
great
regret
he
said
it
is
something
i've
apologized
extensively
for
and
in
contrast
to
the
president
where
he
says
there's
not
a
single
thing
that
he
sort
of
regrets
or
apologizes
for
i
profoundly
apologize
for
that
and
i
believe
in
the
christian
model
of
repentance
and
renewal
and
a
second
chance
and
what's
been
interesting
in
the
wake
of
all
of
that
this
is
years
ago
is
that
subsequent
of
that
the
folks
who
knew
me
best
back
home
said
look
we
don't
approve
of
that
chapter
of
life
or
how
you
handled
it
but
we're
going
to
give
you
a
second
chance
and
we're
going
to
send
you
to
congress
to
represent
us
which
i
did
for
the
following
six
years
he
continued
sanford's
announcement
comes
as
his
home
state's
gop
canceled
its
primary
following
other
states
canceling
their
republican
primaries
i
think
we
need
to
have
a
conversation
on
the
degree
to
which
institutions
and
political
culture
are
being
damaged
by
this
president
sanford
said
adding
those
institutions
and
that
political
culture
are
really
the
glue
that
holds
together
our
balance
of
power
that's
a
longer
conversation
and
finally
i
think
we
need
to
have
a
conversation
on
humility
and
one's
approach
to
politics
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
tweet
is
interesting
it
may
be
newsworthy
but
it's
not
leadership
and
we're
not
going
to
solve
some
of
the
profound
problems
that
we
have
as
americans
by
tweet
republicans
haven't
had
a
choice
on
trump
sanford
said
and
that's
why
i'm
running
he
continued
i
think
that
americans
deserve
and
need
a
choice
