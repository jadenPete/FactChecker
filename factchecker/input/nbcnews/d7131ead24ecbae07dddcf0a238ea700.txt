with

international
hotel
in

in

i
have
a

i
read
in
the
paper
to
this
day
i
haven't
spoken
to
him
about
it
but
he's
using
the
hotel
and
people
like
my
product
what

it

sought
to
distance
himself
from

had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
of
our
great
vp
mike
pence
to
stay
overnight
at
one
of
the
trump
owned
resorts

mike's
family

he
thought
that
during
his
very
busy
european
visit
he
would
stop
and
see
his
family
