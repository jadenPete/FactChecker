claims
amid
backlash

the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration's
acting
chief
scientist
said
that
he
would
investigate
why
the
agency
backed
president
donald
trump's
claims
about
hurricane
dorian
hitting
alabama
over
its
own
forecasters
in
an
internal
email
obtained
by
nbc
news
noaa's
craig
mclean
wrote
sunday
that
an
unsigned
friday
statement
issued
by
the
agency
in
defense
of
trump
inappropriately
and
incorrectly
contradicted
the
national
weather
service
forecaster
the
friday
statement
referred
to
a
tweet
from
national
weather
service's
birmingham
alabama
office
last
weekend
rebutting
the
president
who
had
claimed
earlier
in
the
day
that
alabama
was
in
the
path
of
the
storm
my
understanding
is
that
this
intervention
to
contradict
the
forecaster
was
not
based
on
science
but
on
external
factors
including
reputation
and
appearance
or
simply
put
political
mclean
wrote
our
noaa
scientific
integrity
policy
and
code
of
scientific
conduct
make
clear
that
all
noaa
employees
shall
approach
all
scientific
activities
with
honesty
objectively
and
completely
without
allegiance
to
individuals
organizations
or
ideology
he
called
the
content
of
the
release
very
concerning
as
it
compromises
the
ability
of
noaa
to
convey
life-saving
information
necessary
to
avoid
substantial
and
specific
danger
to
public
health
and
safety
if
the
public
cannot
trust
our
information
or
we
debase
our
forecaster's
warnings
and
products
that
specific
danger
arises
he
continued
you
know
that
the
value
of
our
science
is
in
the
complexity
of
our
understanding
our
ability
to
convey
that
understanding
to
a
wide
audience
of
users
of
this
information
and
to
establish
and
sustain
the
public
trust
in
the
truth
and
legitimacy
of
that
information
unfortunately
the
press
release
of
last
friday
violated
this
trust
and
violated
noaa's
policies
of
scientific
integrity
mclean
said
he
is
pursuing
the
potential
violations
of
our
noaa
administrative
order
on
scientific
integrity
adding
i
have
a
responsibility
to
pursue
these
truths
the
email
was
first
reported
by
the
washington
post
noaa's
friday
statement
caused
an
uproar
in
the
weather
community
the
unsigned
statement
defended
trump's
claims
that
the
hurricane
would
affect
alabama
adding
that
nws
birmingham
was
wrong
to
speak
in
absolute
terms
regarding
its
tweet
insisting
alabama
was
not
at
risk
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
letter
is
also
being
reviewed
by
the
inspector
general
for
the
commerce
department
which
oversees
noaa
the
kerfuffle
over
trump's
alabama
remarks
has
now
gone
on
for
more
than
a
week
well
after
the
storm
devastated
the
bahamas
and
caused
major
damage
in
the
carolinas
it
began
with
trump
tweeting
on
sept
that
alabama
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
at
that
time
the
southeastern
corner
of
alabama
stood
at
a
minuscule
risk
of
receiving
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
excess
of
miles
per
hour
but
the
state
was
not
in
the
national
hurricane
center's
projected
path
for
the
storm
or
its
cone
of
uncertainty
which
by
that
point
showed
the
hurricane
moving
up
the
east
coast
about
minutes
after
trump's
tweet
nws
birmingham
tweeted
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
because
the
storm
will
remain
too
far
east
trump
doubled
down
later
that
day
twice
telling
reporters
that
the
storm
was
threatening
alabama
then
on
wednesday
trump
displayed
an
apparently
doctored
map
in
the
oval
office
that
showed
alabama
circled
in
black
marker
that
looked
to
be
from
a
sharpie
to
be
within
dorian's
path
trump
would
lament
coverage
of
his
alabama
remarks
in
the
days
to
come
tweeting
that
the
coverage
was
meant
to
demean
him
the
new
york
times
on
monday
reported
that
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
threatened
to
fire
top
employees
at
the
noaa
over
the
birmingham
office's
statement
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
discussion
according
to
the
times
that
threat
led
to
noaa's
statement
on
friday
backing
up
the
president's
claims
a
commerce
department
spokesperson
called
the
times
report
false
the
friday
statement
was
met
with
derision
from
forecasters
and
industry
leaders
dan
sobien
president
of
the
national
weather
service
employees
organization
the
union
that
represents
nws
forecasters
blasted
the
statement
in
a
friday
tweet
calling
it
disgusting
and
disingenuous
the
head
of
the
national
weather
service
on
monday
issued
a
strong
defense
of
the
alabama
forecasters
who
contradicted
trump
earning
a
round
of
applause
at
a
national
weather
association
event
in
birmingham
the
associated
press
reported
nws
director
louis
uccellini
said
local
forecasters
made
the
right
call
in
tweeting
that
alabama
faced
no
threat
saying
that
they
had
fielded
calls
from
concerned
citizens
and
only
later
found
out
that
the
president
was
the
source
of
the
misinformation
uccellini
said
those
forecasters
did
what
any
office
would
do
to
protect
the
public
responding
to
mclean's
email
scott
smullen
the
noaa's
deputy
director
of
communications
said
the
agency's
senior
career
leaders
are
free
to
express
their
opinions
about
matters
of
agency
operations
and
science
the
agency
will
not
be
providing
further
official
comment
and
will
not
speculate
on
internal
reviews

added
