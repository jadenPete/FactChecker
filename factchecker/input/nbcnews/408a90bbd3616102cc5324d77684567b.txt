lawmakers
blast
trump
plan
to
use
puerto
rico
funds
for
his
border
wall
trump
has
a
history
of
making
disparaging
remarks
about
the
u.s.
territory
lawmakers
on
thursday
blasted
president
donald
trump's
plan
to
siphon
million
from
military
construction
projects
in
puerto
rico
to
help
pay
for
his
long-promised
wall
along
the
southern
border
the
repurposing
of
these
funds
will
make
puerto
ricans
less
safe
by
reducing
u.s.
military
readiness
and
diverting
resources
from
puerto
rico's
national
guard
rep
nydia
vel
zquez
d-ny
said
in
a
statement
the
million
is
part
of
billion
in
military
construction
money
that's
being
diverted
by
the
department
of
defense
to
pay
for
miles
of
fencing
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
half
the
money
is
being
taken
from
domestic
projects
and
the
other
half
from
international
projects
puerto
rico
a
u.s.
territory
that's
been
repeatedly
criticized
by
the
president
was
targeted
for
the
biggest
diversion
of
funds
domestically
despite
its
struggle
to
rebuild
after
s
hurricane
maria
and
a
corruption
scandal
that
forced
its
governor
from
office
among
the
projects
affected
are
power
substation
and
a
national
guard
readiness
center
not
only
will
the
reprogramming
of
these
funds
make
puerto
rico
less
prepared
in
the
event
of
disasters
but
it
would
likely
harm
the
local
economy
by
depriving
on-island
contractors
of
job-creating
opportunities
vel
zquez
said
calling
the
move
shameful
the
president
intends
to
steal
money
from
an
already
impoverished
island
to
finance
his
coldhearted
persecution
of
immigrants
she
said
rep
jenniffer
gonz
lez-colon
the
island's
non-voting
member
in
congress
and
a
republican
said
puerto
rico
is
an
insular
jurisdiction
that
primarily
relies
on
assets
maintained
on
the
ground
as
we
continue
evaluating
lessons
learned
by
the
hurricane
season
and
the
consequences
it
had
on
my
constituents
we
need
to
allow
military
units
on
the
island
to
have
the
resources
they
need
as
they
are
the
first
line
of
defense
in
the
aftermath
of
any
natural
or
man
made
disaster
rep
darren
soto
d-fla
told
nbc
news
in
an
e-mailed
statement
that
trump's
plans
to
put
off
military
construction
in
puerto
rico
and
florida
show
that
he
is
willing
to
put
national
security
in
jeopardy
hurt
our
troops
and
derail
disaster
recovery
to
fund
his
ineffective
medieval
border
wall
over
million
puerto
ricans
live
in
florida
trump
whose
response
to
the
hurricane
received
widespread
criticism
has
complained
since
that
the
territory's
politicians
weren't
grateful
enough
for
the
aid
they'd
received
and
has
sought
to
cut
the
amount
of
aid
it
will
get
in
the
future
he
has
also
repeatedly
vastly
overstated
the
amount
of
disaster
aid
that
has
gone
to
the
island
claiming
it
had
received
billion
in
aid
when
it'd
actually
gotten
billion
and
reportedly
privately
joked
about
trading
the
island
to
denmark
in
return
for
greenland
last
week
trump
complained
on
twitter
that
then-tropical
storm
dorian
appeared
to
be
headed
to
puerto
rico
as
usual
he
went
on
to
call
it
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
their
political
system
is
broken
and
their
politicians
are
either
incompetent
or
corrupt
congress
approved
billions
of
dollars
last
time
more
than
anyplace
else
has
ever
gotten
and
it
is
sent
to
crooked
pols
no
good
he
added
that
fema
and
all
others
are
ready
and
will
do
a
great
job
when
they
do
let
them
know
it
and
give
them
a
big
thank
you
not
like
last
time
in
total
the
pentagon
is
redirecting
money
for
military
projects
in
states
u.s.
territories
and
foreign
countries
towards
wall
construction
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
noted
on
twitter
that
some
of
the
money
being
diverted
in
europe
could
impact
allies
abilities
to
protect
themselves
from
russia
trump
is
defunding
hurricane
recovery
in
puerto
rico
and
laying
off
of
russia
in
europe
to
fund
his
racist
border
wall
the
former
texas
congressman
tweeted
the
border
wall
has
been
one
of
trump's
signature
promises
as
both
a
candidate
and
later
as
president
he
repeatedly
promised
that
american
taxpayers
wouldn't
have
to
foot
the
bill
mexico
will
pay
for
the
wall
he
tweeted
three
years
ago
this
week
