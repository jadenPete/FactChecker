insists
giveaway
contest
is
perfectly
legal
if
i
gave
a
million
dollars
to
a
media
company

hired
like
a

yang
said
democratic
presidential
candidate
andrew
yang
insisted
sunday
that
his
contest
to
provide
americans
monthly
for
one
year
which
would
come
from
campaign
donations
is
perfectly
legal
even
as
campaign
finance
experts
have
expressed
skepticism
yes
we
have
an
army
of
lawyers
who
signed
off
on
it
yang
the
year-old
businessman
who
has
seen
his
upstart
presidential
campaign
gain
momentum
in
recent
months
told
cnn's
state
of
the
union
and
we're
sure
that
this
is
perfectly
legal
yang
added
that
if
i
gave
a
million
dollars
to
a
media
company
or
consultants
or
hired
like
a
small
army
of
canvassers
no
one
would
blink
an
eye
but
if
we
give
the
money
directly
to
the
american
people
somehow
that's
problematic
he
continued
so
it
just
speaks
to
how
messed
up
our
system
is
where
giving
money
directly
to
americans
actually
raises
eyebrows
during
thursday's
democratic
primary
debate
yang
vowed
to
provide
winners
of
an
online
raffle
with
a
month
for
an
entire
year
even
if
his
presidential
campaign
has
ended
by
that
point
the
cash
contest
echoes
the
central
proposal
of
his
campaign
the
freedom
dividend
which
calls
for
the
government
to
provide
in
universal
basic
income
to
all
americans
over
the
age
of
yang
has
already
been
paying
out
such
freedom
dividends
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
three
families
one
in
new
hampshire
one
in
iowa
and
one
in
florida
but
the
use
of
campaign
funds
to
do
so
has
come
under
scrutiny
from
campaign
finance
experts
who
say
it
may
not
be
legal
the
federal
election
commission
prohibits
the
use
of
campaign
funds
for
personal
use
stating
that
such
funds
cannot
be
used
to
pay
for
any
expenses
to
fulfill
a
commitment
obligation
or
expense
of
any
person
that
would
exist
irrespective
of
the
candidate's
campaign
or
responsibilities
as
a
federal
officeholder
this
is
known
as
the
irrespective
test
the
personal
use
restrictions
apply
to
anyone
not
just
the
candidate
not
just
the
candidate's
family
or
staff
former
fec
chairman
michael
toner
told
nbc
news
you
have
to
use
those
funds
for
campaign
purposes
yang
and
his
campaign
argue
the
contest
passes
the
irrespective
test
because
he
would
not
be
making
these
payments
if
not
for
his
presidential
campaign
as
the
payments
are
meant
to
highlight
his
campaign's
signature
pledge
experts
have
offered
varying
positions
on
the
legality
of
the
contest
ann
ravel
a
former
federal
election
commission
chief
told
time
you
can't
just
give
cash
if
it's
just
given
for
no
work
done
for
nothing
at
all
just
a
gift
that
is
inappropriate
she
said
university
of
california
irvine
professor
rick
hasen
an
election
law
expert
tweeted
he
didn't
see
a
legal
problem
so
long
as
it
is
not
tied
to
voting
or
registering
