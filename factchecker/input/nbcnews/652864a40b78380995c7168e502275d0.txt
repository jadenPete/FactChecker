tweeted
why
are
you
lending
guns
to
people
unsupervised
who
can't
pass
a
basic
background
check
two
of
the
most
outspoken
freshmen
representatives
tangled
on
twitter
on
wednesday
over
universal
background
checks
the
tussle
began
when
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d.n.y.
slammed
rep
dan
crenshaw
r-texas
for
claiming
that
universal
background
checks
would
prevent
him
from
lending
his
gun
to
friends
who
needed
it
for
self-defense
you
are
a
member
of
congress
ocasio-cortez
tweeted
at
crenshaw
why
are
you
lending
guns
to
people
unsupervised
who
can't
pass
a
basic
background
check
the
people
you're
giving
a
gun
to
have
likely
abused
their
spouse
or
have
a
violent
criminal
record
you
may
not
know
it
why
on
earth
would
you
do
that
crenshaw
shot
back
just
so
i'm
clear
you
think
my
friends
are
domestic
abusers
criminals
seriously
that's
your
argument
that
they
can't
pass
a
background
check
wrong
people
lend
guns
to
friends
esp
if
they
don't
own
a
gun
for
self-defense
and
hunting
purposes
this
is
america
outside
nyc
ocasio-cortez
responded
you
said
w
universal
background
checks
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
lend
guns
to
friends
if
a
background
check
would
be
a
problem
then
you
shouldn't
lend
a
gun
she
said
adding
that
new
york
is
one
of
the
safest
states
in
the
country
when
it
comes
to
guns
she
then
added
that
crenshaw
wouldn't
necessarily
know
if
any
of
his
friends
were
domestic
abusers
this
idea
of
i
know
the
guy
there's
no
way
he
beats
his
wife
as
the
way
we
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
abusers
is
ridiculous
any
person
who
has
been
abused
assaulted
etc
knows
that
abusers
often
present
as
upstanding
she
wrote
most
domestic
abuse
is
hidden
you
could
know
an
abuser
have
no
clue
i've
had
friends
come
out
to
me
as
victims
it's
not
obvious
crenshaw's
initial
tweet
referred
to
a
local
news
story
about
a
houston
woman
who
shot
a
man
who'd
tried
to
steal
her
purse
situations
like
this
story
are
why
we
protect
the
nd
amendment
he
wrote
side
note
with
universal
background
checks
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
met
friends
borrow
my
handgun
when
they
travel
alone
like
this
we
would
make
felons
out
of
people
for
just
defending
themselves
the
pair
have
tussled
on
twitter
before
including
in
february
when
crenshaw
mocked
ocasio-cortez's
tax
proposal
crenshaw
on
tuesday
lashed
out
at
another
democrat
in
the
house
rep
adam
schiff
who
had
pointed
out
that
the
gunman
in
saturday's
deadly
mass
shooting
in
texas
had
gotten
his
weapon
in
a
private
sale
that
didn't
require
a
background
check
law
enforcement
sources
told
nbc
news
that
the
gunman
failed
a
background
check
in
over
mental
health
issues
this
is
the
st
mass
shooting
where
a
universal
background
check
possibly
would
have
prevented
him
from
having
a
gun
if
and
only
if
they
decided
to
self-enforce
that
law
crenshaw
wrote
guys
who
shoot
cops
tend
not
to
self-enforce
laws
and
we
don't
make
sweeping
policy
on
one
situation
