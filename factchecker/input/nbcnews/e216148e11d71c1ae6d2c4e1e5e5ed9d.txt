peace
talks
at
camp
david
floated
scrapped
within
a
week
u.s.
officials
say
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
vehemently
opposed
the
idea
but
the
state
department
argued
it
could
move
the
parties
closer
to
an
agreement
president
donald
trump's
decision
to
hold
a
meeting
in
washington
with
taliban
leaders
and
afghanistan
president
ashraf
ghani
to
try
to
solidify
a
peace
deal
to
end
the
year-long
war
was
first
discussed
about
a
week
ago
according
to
u.s.
officials
and
others
briefed
on
the
discussion
the
idea
raised
sept
during
a
situation
room
meeting
with
the
president
was
vehemently
opposed
by
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
even
as
officials
at
the
state
department
argued
it
could
move
the
parties
closer
to
an
agreement
officials
said
bolton
had
an
ally
in
vice
president
mike
pence
who
also
made
the
case
against
a
meeting
at
camp
david
a
location
trump
suggested
officials
said
bolton
and
pence
were
in
warsaw
together
around
the
time
of
the
internal
discussions
using
the
presidential
retreat
in
maryland
to
host
the
meeting
was
floated
by
trump
after
he
warmed
to
the
idea
of
a
sit-down
in
washington
the
officials
and
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
bolton's
office
declined
to
comment
pence's
office
and
a
spokesperson
for
the
president
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
among
the
concerns
of
administration
officials
who
opposed
the
meeting
was
that
it
might
take
place
around
the
anniversary
of
the
attacks
the
officials
and
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
pence
argued
at
one
point
that
such
a
meeting
could
send
the
wrong
message
to
members
of
the
u.s.
military
who
have
fought
and
been
killed
by
the
taliban
for
years
one
senior
administration
official
said
there
also
was
concern
among
some
u.s.
officials
that
ghani
would
not
show
up
for
such
a
meeting
and
they
argued
it
was
better
for
the
president
to
cancel
first
than
be
stood
up
the
officials
and
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
there
has
been
broad
skepticism
within
the
national
security
team
even
among
those
supporting
the
deal
that
it
would
hold
even
if
finalized
they
said
the
view
was
that
the
taliban
couldn't
be
trusted
to
live
up
to
its
commitments
and
that
a
deal
would
very
quickly
collapse
once
the
afghan
government
was
brought
into
the
talks
one
concern
among
some
administration
officials
was
that
elevating
the
negotiations
to
a
meeting
with
the
president
at
camp
david
might
later
embarrass
trump
if
a
deal
fell
apart
officials
said
bolton
has
been
deeply
skeptical
of
negotiations
with
the
taliban
which
are
being
led
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo's
envoy
on
the
issue
former
ambassador
zalmay
khalilzad
u.s.
negotiators
have
been
working
under
the
president's
demand
that
a
drawdown
occur
before
november
when
he's
up
for
re-election
the
taliban
has
offered
a
different
version
of
events
a
senior
taliban
leader
told
nbc
news
monday
that
trump
appears
to
have
cancelled
the
negotiations
after
the
group
refused
to
travel
to
camp
david
to
hold
direct
talks
with
the
afghan
leadership
we
have
informed
zalmay
khalilzad
a
number
of
times
that
we
don't
consider
ashraf
ghani
and
his
administration
as
a
legitimate
government
and
therefore
we
refused
to
hold
direct
talks
with
them
the
taliban
leader
based
in
qatar
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
declining
the
invitation
apparently
provoked
the
president
and
he
suspended
peace
talks
in
reaction
he
added
nbc
news
could
not
confirm
the
claims
and
the
taliban
offered
no
evidence
to
back
them
up
and
is
known
for
being
untruthful
and
for
exaggerating
claims
pompeo
said
sunday
that
the
afghanistan
peace
talks
were
dead
for
now
but
he
left
the
door
open
for
negotiations
to
resume
his
comments
came
after
trump
both
first
disclosed
plans
for
the
camp
david
meeting
and
called
it
off
tweeting
that
it
was
because
of
the
taliban's
claim
of
responsibility
for
a
car
bombing
in
kabul
that
killed
a
member
of
the
u.s.
military
marking
the
th
american
combat
death
in
afghanistan
this
year
how
many
more
decades
are
they
willing
to
fight
trump
tweeted
referring
to
the
taliban
