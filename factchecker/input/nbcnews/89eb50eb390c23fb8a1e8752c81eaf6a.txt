you
might
be
surprised
at
who's
opposed
conservatives
have
found
some
surprising
allies
as
they
fight
efforts
to
raise
the
marriage
age
a
bill
that
would
have
ended
child
marriage
in
idaho
which
has
no
minimum
age

couples
who
want
to
wed
died
in
the
statehouse
this
year
republican
lawmakers
who
control
the
legislature
opposed
it
including
state
rep
bryan
zollinger
who
said
it
went
too
far
obviously
i'm
against
child
marriage
the
gop
lawmaker
told
nbc
news
but
basically
marriage
is
a
contract
between
people
that
shouldn't
require
government
permission
even
as
more
states
take
action
to
end
child
marriage
concerns
about
government
overreach
along
with
scant
data
about
the
extent
of
the
problem
have
driven
skepticism
to
reform
across
the
country
the
divide
has
sometimes
created
unlikely
alliances
between
conservative
politicians
and
liberal-leaning
groups
including
the
aclu
and
planned
parenthood
in
california
and
louisiana
opponents
of
change
have
argued
that
raising
the
minimum
marriage
age
is
an
ineffective
solution
since
other
child
welfare
laws
already
can
prevent
young
girls
from
being
exploited
and
other
states
such
as
massachusetts
have
raised
doubts
about
the
extent
of
the
problem
even
as
experts
note
that
survivors
are
often
reluctant
to
come
forward
idaho
has
the
highest
rate
of
child
marriages
in
the
u.s.
according
to
a
national
report
from
unchained
at
last
an
organization
dedicated
to
ending
the
practice
in
the
u.s.
the
democratic
sponsor
of
the
idaho
legislation
which
would
have
set
the
marriage
age
at
said
that
she
thought
her
bill
was
a
modest
compromise
however
idaho
state
rep
christy
zito
who
voted
alongside
zollinger
against
the
measure
said
she
was
concerned
about
protecting
the
sanctity
of
family
she
added
that
there
are
sufficient
safeguards
in
state
law
such
as
a
judicial
review
of
underage
marriages
to
prevent
older
men
from
exploiting
young
girls
an
issue
she
said
she
has
not
seen
evidence
of
in
idaho
in
california
a
bill
to
set
the
minimum
marriage
age
at
the
state's
age
of
consent
failed
in
after
objections
from
lawmakers
and
liberal
groups
such
as
the
state's
american
civil
liberties
union
the
state
currently
has
no
minimum
marriage
age
and
collects
little
to
no
data
on
child
marriages
the
aclu
argued
that
the
bill
unnecessarily
and
unduly
intrudes
on
the
fundamental
rights
of
marriage
without
sufficient
cause
adding
that
largely
banning
marriage
under
before
we
have
evidence
regarding
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
problem
however
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse
other
groups
like
planned
parenthood
and
the
national
center
for
youth
law
a
youth
advocacy
organization
agreed
in
new
hampshire
it
took
cassandra
levesque
and
other
advocates
several
tries
to
raise
the
minimum
marriage
age
to
after
levesque
learned
that
the
state's
minimum
marriage
age
was
for
boys
and
for
girls
she
made
the
issue
a
focus
of
a
girl
scout
project
compiling
research
contacting
her
state
representatives
and
reaching
out
to
advocacy
groups
in
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
state
house
to
raise
the
marriage
age
to
the
state's
statutory
age
of
consent
i
was
just
trying
to
get
as
many
people
behind
this
as
possible
levesque
now
told
nbc
news
but
a
legislative
maneuver
killed
the
bill
indefinitely
after
state
gop
rep
david
bates
and
others
raised
concerns
about
whether
teens
could
marry
while
one
was
deployed
for
military
service
bates
lambasted
levesque
and
scolded
his
colleagues
in
a
speech
on
the
state
house
floor
at
the
time
we're
asking
the
legislature
to
repeal
a
law
that's
been
on
the
books
for
over
a
century
that's
been
working
without
difficulty
on
the
basis
of
a
request
from
a
minor
doing
a
girl
scout
project
he
said
despite
the
opposition
levesque
faced
she
was
able
to
work
with
representatives
to
draft
a
new
bill
setting
the
age
limit
at
which
later
passed
and
last
year
at
age
she
decided
more
needed
to
be
done
on
the
issue
and
ran
for
a
house
seat
in
the
state
she
won
and
is
now
working
to
raise
the
minimum
marriage
age
to
this
time
i
had
all
my
bases
covered
levesque
said
it's
definitely
a
big
issue
i'm
trying
to
fight
idaho
and
california
are
not
alone
in
not
having
a
minimum
marriage
age
a
majority
of
states
which
issue
marriage
licenses
allow
and
year-olds
to
marry
a
few
allow
year-olds
and
states
have
no
minimum
marriage
age
as
of
september
before
when
virginia
became
the
first
state
to
put
its
marriage
age
into
law
more
than
half
of
the
states
had
no
minimum
marriage
age
fixed
by
statute
fraidy
reiss
a
survivor
of
forced
marriage
and
the
founder
of
unchained
at
last
told
nbc
news
that
she
finds
some
of
the
rationales
against
raising
the
minimum
marriage
age
in
all
states
to
baffling
because
the
federal
government
considers
marriage
under
in
foreign
countries
a
human
rights
abuse
according
to
the
group
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
children
were
married
in
the
u.s.
from
to
the
majority
of
whom
were
young
girls
marrying
older
men
this
is
happening
and
it's
happening
at
an
alarming
rate
she
said
in
louisiana
a
heated
debate
erupted
in
the
legislature
this
year
as
lawmakers
haggled
over
whether
to
set
a
minimum
marriage
age
in
the
state
republicans
and
a
handful
of
democrats
argued
that
teens
should
be
allowed
to
marry
in
certain
instances
such
as
pregnancy
or
military
service
if
they're
both
years
old
and
they
both
consent
to
sexual
relations
and
they're
about
to
have
a
baby
why
wouldn't
we
want
them
to
be
married
state
rep
nancy
landry
a
republican
said
at
the
time
kathleen
benfield
the
legislative
director
for
the
louisiana
family
forum
an
influential
conservative
nonprofit
in
the
state
said
that
her
organization
was
also
concerned
about
forcing
a
teen
mother
to
give
birth
out
of
wedlock
if
the
age
was
set
at
with
no
exceptions
we
would
oppose
any
exploitation
of
young
girls
by
older
men
that's
the
bottom
line
benfield
said
but
we
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
value
of
marriage
as
a
cherished
institution
was
supported
in
the
end
the
group
gave
the
bill
lukewarm
support
thanks
to
provisions
such
as
requiring
that
the
age
difference
between
a
minor
and
an
adult
be
no
more
than
three
years
placing
stringent
guidelines
for
judges
to
review
each
case
and
mandating
the
collection
of
marriage
data
in
the
state
to
study
the
extent
of
child
marriage
the
bill
passed
in
june
setting
the
minimum
marriage
age
at
and
the
law
was
set
to
take
effect
in
august
reiss
who
lobbies
lawmakers
as
part
of
her
group's
advocacy
work
against
child
and
forced
marriage
said
she
has
seen
some
success
in
direct
outreach
where
we
have
less
luck
is
legislators
who
say
i
don't
care
i
don't
care
a
girl
gets
pregnant
she's
got
to
get
married
she
added
or
the
ones
who
look
at
me
and
say
i've
had
this
in
multiple
states
well
joseph
married
mary
when
she
was
if
it
was
good
enough
for
god
why
shouldn't
it
be
good
enough
for
us
she
believes
lawmakers
often
conflate
the
maturity
of
some
teens
with
the
legal
capacity
to
enter
a
marriage
which
is
considered
a
legal
contract
that
many
laws
specify
only
adults
can
enter
into
or
annul
for
someone
to
say
if
you're
and
you're
mature
and
in
love
that
it's
somehow
ok
for
you
to
marry
no
it's
not
because
you're
still
not
an
adult
she
said
you
cannot
be
allowed
to
marry
before
you
were
allowed
to
file
for
divorce
that's
just
so
obvious
