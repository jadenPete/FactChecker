share
this
trump
reportedly
put
freeze
on
aid
before
call
with
ukraine
president
the
president
has
denied
leveraging
military
aid
for
an
investigation
into
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
washington
president
donald
trump
ordered
his
staff
to
freeze
nearly
million
in
aid
to
ukraine
a
few
days
before
a
phone
call
in
which
he
pressured
the
eastern
european
nation's
leader
to
investigate
the
family
of
political
rival
joe
biden
a
new
revelation
that
comes
as
more
democrats
move
toward
impeachment
proceedings
trump's
order
was
first
reported
by
the
washington
post
and
was
confirmed
to
the
associated
press
by
two
people
familiar
with
but
not
authorized
to
discuss
private
conversations
they
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
late
monday
an
influential
group
of
freshmen
democrats
who
served
in
the
military
and
national
security
before
winning
office
said
trump's
actions
cut
to
the
core
of
the
country's
defenses
their
views
as
centrist
lawmakers
from
previously
republican-held
districts
where
trump
has
been
popular
hold
sway
with
party
leadership
at
issue
is
a
summer
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
voldymyr
zelenskiy
in
which
trump
is
said
to
have
pushed
for
investigations
into
biden
in
the
days
before
that
call
trump
ordered
the
aid
to
ukraine
frozen
trump
has
insisted
he
did
nothing
wrong
and
has
denied
that
any
requests
for
help
in
procuring
damaging
information
about
biden
were
tied
to
the
aid
freeze
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
on
monday
night
denied
reports
about
withholding
military
funds
the
media
pushed
the
russia
lie
for
almost
three
years
with
no
evidence
and
now
they
are
doing
it
all
over
again
he
told
nbc
news
these
allegations
are
completely
false
but
because
the
media
wants
this
story
to
be
true
so
badly
they'll
once
again
manufacture
a
frenzy
and
drive
ignorant
fake
stories
to
attack
this
president
democrats
and
some
republicans
urged
the
white
house
to
be
open
about
his
actions
which
are
the
center
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
but
with
no
new
information
from
the
administration
forthcoming
more
than
a
dozen
democrats
including
some
in
house
leadership
added
their
names
to
those
calling
for
impeachment
proceedings
the
sudden
rush
of
activity
shows
the
extent
to
which
trump's
call
to
the
foreign
leader
and
his
subsequent
comments
about
the
conversation
are
raising
further
questions
about
whether
the
president
improperly
used
his
office
to
pressure
another
country
as
a
way
of
helping
his
own
re-election
prospects
these
allegations
are
stunning
both
in
the
national
security
threat
they
pose
and
the
potential
corruption
they
represent
wrote
the
seven
freshmen
who
include
a
former
navy
pilot
soldiers
officers
and
intelligence
analysts
we
do
not
arrive
at
this
conclusion
lightly
the
lawmakers
wrote
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
the
lawmakers
include
reps
gil
cisneros
of
california
jason
crow
of
colorado
chrissy
houlahan
of
pennsylvania
elaine
luria
of
virginia
mikie
sherrill
of
new
jersey
elissa
slotkin
of
michigan
and
abigail
spanberger
of
virginia
these
new
allegations
are
a
threat
to
all
we
have
sworn
to
protect
we
must
preserve
the
checks
and
balances
envisioned
by
the
founders
and
restore
the
trust
of
the
american
people
in
our
government
and
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do
congress
on
monday
pressed
for
full
disclosure
of
a
whistleblower's
complaint
about
trump
and
pushed
the
white
house
to
release
a
transcript
of
trump's
call
with
the
ukraine
president
the
president
has
acknowledged
the
phone
call
on
monday
he
said
he
didn't
want
to
give
money
to
ukraine
if
there
were
corruption
issues
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
corruption
trump
told
reporters
as
he
opened
meetings
at
the
united
nations
if
you
don't
talk
about
corruption
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
is
corrupt
later
monday
trump
denied
telling
the
ukraine
president
that
his
country
would
only
get
u.s.
aid
if
it
investigated
biden's
son
i
didn't
do
it
he
said
trump
has
sought
without
evidence
to
implicate
biden
and
his
son
hunter
in
the
kind
of
corruption
that
has
long
plagued
ukraine
hunter
biden
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
at
the
same
time
his
father
was
leading
the
obama
administration's
diplomatic
dealings
with
kyiv
though
the
timing
raised
concerns
among
anti-corruption
advocates
there
has
been
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
either
the
former
vice
president
or
his
son
the
matter
is
under
new
scrutiny
following
the
whistleblower's
mid-august
complaint
which
followed
trump's
july
call
with
ukraine
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
the
person
who
filed
the
complaint
did
not
have
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
call
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
lawmakers
are
demanding
details
of
the
complaint
but
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
refused
to
share
that
information
citing
presidential
privilege
he
is
set
to
testify
thursday
before
the
house
let's
see
the
transcript
said
sen
mitt
romney

trump's
call
with
the
ukraine
president
the
chairmen
of
the
house
intelligence
foreign
affairs
and
oversight
and
government
reform
committees
are
threatening
to
subpoena
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
if
he
does
not
produce
information
about
whether
trump
and
his
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
inappropriately
tried
to
influence
the
ukraine
government
for
political
gain
meanwhile
senate
democratic
leader

called
on
republican
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
to
investigate
the
whistleblower's
complaint
in
a
letter
to
mcconnell
he
said
that
the
republicans
see
no
evil
hear
no
evil
attitude
toward
the
president's
actions
is
unacceptable
and
must
change
republican
sen
marco
rubio
of
florida
doesn't
think
trump's
actions
are
grounds
for
impeachment
but
said
he
wouldn't
have
called
a
foreign
leader
to
discuss
a
rival
i
don't
think
he
should
have
raised
the
topic
of
joe
biden
with
the
ukraine
president
rubio
said
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
monday
the
matter
is
best
left
behind
closed
doors
in
the
classified
setting
of
the
intelligence
committee
though
he
did
push
into
the
spotlight
his
own
role
in
securing
the
ukraine
aid
mcconnell
said
he
had
been
personally
pressuring
the
trump
administration
this
summer
in
calls
to
pompeo
and
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
to
release
the
u.s.
aid
money
trump
said
monday
he
may
or
may
not
release
details
or
a
transcript
of
the
call
but
has
stressed
that
foreign
leaders
should
feel
free
to
speak
frankly
with
an
american
president
without
fear
that
the
details
of
their
conversations
will
later
be
disclosed
hunter
biden
was
hired
by
the
ukrainian
gas
company
burisma
holdings
in
april
two
months
after
ukraine's
russia-friendly
former
president
was
ousted
by
protesters
and
as
biden's
father
was
heavily
involved
in
u.s.
efforts
to
support
the
new
pro-western
government
the
move
immediately
raised
concerns
that
the
ukrainian
firm
whose
owner
was
a
political
ally
of
the
ousted
president
was
seeking
to
gain
influence
with
the
obama
administration

and
zelenskiy
plan
to
meet
on
the
sidelines
of
the
u.n.
