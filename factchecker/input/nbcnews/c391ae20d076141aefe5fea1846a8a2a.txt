wealthy
people
don't
often
invite
socialists
to
speak
at
their
conferences
but
most
gatherings
of
the
rich
are
not
like
the
way
to
win
network
ofdeep-pocketed
progressive
donors
run
almost
entirely
by
women
who
don't
fit
the
typical
mold
of
other
big-money
political
givers
the
network
which
recommends
where
donations
should
be
directed
has
placed
more
than
million
to
political
nonprofit
groups
and
candidatessince
its
founding
in
and
plans
to
expand
on
that
significantly
to
at
least
million
in
next
election
cycle
while
sticking
to
its
approach
of
remaking
the
democratic
party
by
sending
money
to
small
local
groups
run
predominantly
by
people
of
color
and
women
at
a
conference
in
scottsdale
arizona
on
monday
the
group
is
unveiling
its
plan
to
win
in
shared
early
with
nbc
news
which
explicitly
rejects
the
focus
many
democrats
have
on
beating
president
donald
trump
by
winning
back
working-class
white
voters
in
the
rust
belt
instead
the
plan
favors
expanding
turnout
among
minorities
and
other
democratic-leaning
demographic
groups
in
rapidly
diversifying
states
like
arizona
georgia
north
carolina
texas
and
florida
we
can
win
the
white
house
without
taking
the
midwestern
states
that
slipped
in
and
where
demographic
trends
are
unfavorable
the
plan
says
laying
out
a
strategy
to
support
grassroots
organizing
efforts
the
group
hopes
will
help
democrats
win
everything
from
school
boards
to
the
white
house
by
bringing
new
voters
into
the
process
you
have
a
president
who
is
attacking
birthright
citizenship
putting
people
in
cages
if
these
don't
persuade
you
that
he
is
not
the
right
person
to
lead
the
country
then
i
don't
know
what
persuasion
campaign
will
said
way
to
win
co-founder
tory
gavito
he's
got
a
base
mobilization
strategy
which
means
we
need
to
too
in
addition
to
an
opening
keynote
address
from
tiffany
cab
n
the
year-old
democratic
socialist
who
narrowly
lost
a
recent
district
attorney
race
in
queens
the
conference
features
appearances
from
left-wing
groups
like
justice
democrats
which
recruited
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
to
run
for
congress
and
the
climate
group
sunshine
movement
known
for
their
frequent
protests
of
republicans
and
democrats
alike
needless
to
say
these
are
not
your
typical
joe
biden
donors
they
probably
have
more
in
common
with
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
even
though
those
candidates
have
sworn
off
big
donors
i
think
there's
a
new
generation
of
donors
who
are
open
to
taking
more
risks
and
who
have
lived
through
past
mistakes
said
another
of
the
group's
co-founders
leah
hunt-hendrix
an
heiress
to
a
texas
oil
fortune
founded
by
her
late
grandfather
h.l.
hunt
who
made
a
name
for
himself
by
promoting
right-wing
causes
i
always
knew
from
a
young
age
that
wealth
did
not
equal
happiness
said
hunt-hendrix
who
was
involved
with
the
occupy
wall
street
movement
that
people
with
wealth
are
often
isolated
and
struggling
and
lonely
and
that
by
really
being
involved
in
something
bigger
than
yourself
and
contributing
to
the
arc
of
history
that
you
can
find
so
much
more
happiness
and
community
sacrificing
some
of
one's
wealth
or
power
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
world
that
is
more
just
and
fair
and
where
those
resources
and
shared
she
has
attracted
other
prominent
liberal
donors
with
an
approach
that
prioritizes
long-term
investments
in
grassroots
organizing
to
bring
new
voters
into
the
process
instead
of
dumping
a
ton
of
money
on
tv
ads
to
win
the
next
election
after
the
infamous
election
i
think
many
of
us
were
so
taken
sideways
that
there
was
a
very
strong
feeling
that
the
old
ways
weren't
working
said
susan
stowell
pritzker
a
member
of
one
the
wealthiest
families
in
the
country
the
pritzkers
who
own
hyatt
hotels
are
prominent
democratic
donors
closely
associated
with
former
president
barack
obama
and
relations
include
the
current
governor
of
illinois
j.b.
pritzker
and
obama's
former
commerce
secretary
penny
pritzker
pritzker
said
she
has
had
trouble
convincing
other
wealthy
benefactors
that
investing
in
communities
of
color
is
the
best
way
to
secure
the
democratic
party's
future
they
nod
and
stare
but
i
have
had
a
hard
time
getting
in
she
told
nbc
news
i
don't
want
to
say
that
it's
implicit
bias
or
a
white
person's
fear
of
the
brown
horde
because
it
wouldn't
be
conscious
it'd
be
unconscious
but
it
might
be
there
the
mostly
white
members
of
way
to
win
can
be
an
unlikely
partner
with
minority-focused
groups
they
support
but
a
valuable
one
said
nse
ufot
the
executive
director
of
the
new
georgia
project
it's
clear
that
they
shared
our
analysis
said
ufot
whose
group
was
founded
by
former
gubernatorial
candidate
stacey
abrams
we
can
bring
the
wealthy
often
white
donor
and
operative
class
along
with
us
hunt-hendrix
and
her
colleagues
scour
the
country
for
groups
and
leaders
they
think
are
doing
the
best
job
organizing
voters
who
aren't
likely
to
turn
out
in
key
states
in
important
races
up
and
down
the
ballot
three-quarters
of
the
group
way
to
win
supports
are
run
by
people
of
color
and
percent
are
run
by
women
most
traditional
big-money
groups
meanwhile
are
not
ready
to
give
up
on
swing
voters
in
places
like
wisconsin
we
know
that
by
every
measurement
there's
a
host
of
undecided
voters
who
are
open
to
being
persuaded
said
guy
cecil
the
chairman
of
the
democrats
largest
super
pac
priorities
usa
at
a
recent
briefing
for
reporters
hunt-hendrix
said
it's
fine
if
other
groups
want
to
chase
swing
voters
but
added
that
she
wants
to
focus
on
getting
fans
to
the
stadium
instead
of
convincing
people
to
switch
teams
it's
a
missed
opportunity
when
we
use
elections
to
focus
on
people
who
are
not
sure
what
they
stand
for
she
said
rather
than
people
who
really
do
believe
in
progressive
priorities
but
have
not
been
brought
into
the
political
process
