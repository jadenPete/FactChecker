share
this
what
is
impeachment
and
how
does
it
work
two
presidents
andrew
johnson
and
bill
clinton
were
impeached
but
the
senate
voted
not
to
convict
either
of
them
washington
the
congressional
power
to
remove
a
president
from
office
through
the
process
known
as
impeachment
is
the
ultimate
check
on
the
executive
no
president
has
ever
been
forced
from
the
white
house
that
way
though
richard
nixon
resigned
rather
than
have
to
face
the
prospect
on
tuesday
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
announced
the
house
of
representatives
is
moving
forward
with
an
official
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
donald
trump
congress
gets
the
authority
from
the
constitution
the
term
impeachment
is
commonly
used
to
mean
removing
someone
from
office
but
it
actually
refers
to
the
filing
of
formal
charges
the
house
impeaches
the
senate
then
holds
a
trial
on
those
charges
to
decide
whether
the
officer
a
president
or
any
other
federal
official
should
be
removed
and
barred
from
holding
federal
office
in
the
future
the
house
has
impeached
people
mostly
federal
judges
two
presidents
andrew
johnson
and
bill
clinton
were
impeached
but
the
senate
voted
not
to
convict
either
of
them
any
member
of
the
house
can
seek
to
start
the
process
by
proposing
a
resolution
of
impeachment
it
would
be
referred
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
which
decides
whether
to
investigate
the
allegations
if
it
does
so
the
committee
would
then
vote
on
whether
grounds
for
impeachment
exist
a
yes
vote
would
report
one
or
more
charges
known
as
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
the
constitution
provides
that
a
president
can
be
impeached
for
treason
bribery
or
other
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
treason
and
bribery
are
well
understood
but
the
constitution
does
not
define
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
congress
has
identified
three
types
of
conduct
that
constitute
grounds
for
impeachment
including
misusing
an
office
for
financial
gain
but
the
misdeeds
need
not
be
crimes
a
president
can
be
impeached
for
abusing
the
powers
of
the
office
or
for
acting
in
a
manner
considered
incompatible
with
the
office
when
gerald
ford
was
a
member
of
the
house
he
famously
defined
an
impeachable
offense
as
whatever
a
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
considers
it
to
be
at
a
given
moment
in
history
in
other
words
impeachment
and
conviction
by
congress
is
a
political
punishment
not
a
criminal
one
once
the
house
judiciary
committee
acts
the
full
house
votes
a
simple
majority
of
those
present
and
voting
is
required
to
impeach
if
the
impeachment
vote
passes
house
managers
are
appointed
to
serve
as
prosecutors
in
the
senate
when
a
president
has
been
impeached
by
the
house
the
supreme
court's
chief
justice
presides
over
the
senate
trial
the
office
holder
is
entitled
to
defense
lawyers
and
each
side
can
call
witnesses
and
present
evidence
when
the
case
has
been
presented
the
senate
meets
in
closed
session
to
deliberate
the
senate
vote
is
conducted
in
open
session
and
a
two-thirds
majority
is
required
for
conviction
if
the
senate
votes
to
convict
the
public
official
on
trial
is
immediately
removed
from
office
the
senate
can
conduct
a
separate
vote
on
whether
to
disqualify
the
official
from
ever
again
holding
federal
office
which
requires
a
simple
majority
the
senate's
vote
is
final
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
because
the
constitution
gives
the
senate
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachments
a
conviction
on
impeachment
cannot
be
appealed
to
any
court
in
all
of
u.s.
history
only
eight
people
have
been
convicted
after
senate
impeachment
trials
and
all
were
federal
judges
pelosi
said
the
congressional
committees
currently
investigating
trump
oversight
intelligence
ways
and
means
financial
services
foreign
services
and
judiciary
would
continue
their
probes
under
that
umbrella
of
impeachment
inquiry
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
said
we
will
continue
to
pursue
the
facts
and
follow
them
wherever
they
lead
including
to
articles
of
impeachment
how
long
that
process
will
take
is
unclear
but
a
source
told
nbc
news
that
pelosi
told
lawmakers
they
need
to
move
expeditiously
the
president
must
be
held
accountable
she
said
in
remarks
after
the
meeting
she
accused
the
president
of
violating
his
oath
of
office
national
security
and
the
integrity
of
our
elections
after
his
admission
that
he
asked
the
president
of
ukraine
to
take
actions
which
would
benefit
him
politically
in
september
the
washington
post
reported
that
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
had
filed
a
whistleblower
complaint
over
trump's
communications
with
a
foreign
leader
the
newspaper
went
on
to
report
that
trump
had
urged
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
investigate
business
dealings
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
hunter
biden
in
order
to
dig
up
dirt
on
a
leading
democratic
contender
the
younger
biden
worked
for
a
ukrainian
gas
company
from
to
and
the
president
has
argued
that
his
father
acted
corruptly
to
benefit
his
son
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
the
president's
call
came
days
after
he
froze
an
million
aid
package
for
the
country
and
democrats
allege
it
is
a
sign
that
the
president
abused
the
presidency
to
try
and
bolster
his
reelection
chances
by
seeking
the
help
of
a
foreign
government
