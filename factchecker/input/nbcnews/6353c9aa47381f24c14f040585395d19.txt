wednesday
the

includes
extensions
of
several

senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
has
said
that
the
senate
plans
to
take
up
the
cr
but
hasn't
yet
announced
timing
for
a
vote
the
vote
will
likely
be
held
next
week
since
congress
will
go
on
recess
the
week
after
the
spending
package
lawmakers
will
craft
for
the
next
fiscal
year
will
abide
by
a
budget
deal
that
president
donald
trump
signed
into
law
in
early
august
that
included
a
billion
increase
for
military
and
funding
for
domestic
program
over
the
next
two
years
this
is
a
welcome
development
and
i
will
urge
the
senate
to
take
up
this
bill
and
pass
it
next
week
and
allow
the
committee
more
time
to
negotiate
bipartisan
bills
to
implement
the
bipartisan
budget
agreement
reached
in
july
sen
patrick
leahy
d-vt
ranking
member
of
the
senate
appropriations
committee
said
in
a
statement
late
wednesday
negotiations
however
could
likely
become
contentious
as
republicans
seek
to
help
trump
fund
his
wall
at
the
u.s.
mexico
border
the
standoff
over
wall
funding
last
year
resulted
in
a
day
shutdown
that
lasted
into
and
an
impasse
over
wall
funding
this
fall
will
likely
increase
the
chances
of
another
shutdown
in
november
