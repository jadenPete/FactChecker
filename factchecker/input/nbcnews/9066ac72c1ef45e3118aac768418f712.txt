dnc
raises
qualification
threshold

debate

how
much
washington
the
democratic
national
committee
is
raising
the
qualification
threshold
for
the
november
presidential
debate
but
the
jump
is
less
steep
than
previous
increases
to
qualify
candidates
will
need
to
hit
percent
support
in
at
least
four
early
state
or
national
polls
that
meet
the
dnc's
methodological
requirements
up
from
percent
for
the
september
and
october
debates
the
number
of
unique
online
donors
needed
to
qualify
will
climb
to
up
from
for
the
previous
two
debates
that's
smaller
than
the
jump
from
the
debates
this
summer
to
the
early
fall
when
the
polling
and
donor
thresholds
doubled
the
new
criteria
will
most
likely
winnow
the
debate
stage
though
it's
unclear
by
how
much
candidates
will
once
again
need
to
hit
both
the
polling
and
grassroots
donor
threshold
but
there
will
be
a
new
option
for
candidates
to
meet
the
polling
threshold
they
can
now
check
that
box
by
getting
at
least
percent
in
two
polls
of
early
states
iowa
new
hampshire
nevada
and
south
carolina
instead
of
percent
in
four
polls
according
to
an
nbc
news
analysis
candidates
appear
to
have
qualified
so
far
for
the
october
debate
in
ohio
using
the
previous
threshold

needs

poll

on

the

debate
could
go
back
to
be
two
nights
after
the
last
debate
shrunk
to
just
one
when
only
candidates
had
qualified
the
debate
hosted
by
cnn
and
the
new

is
scheduled
for
oct
and
potentially
the
dates
location
and

sponsors
for
the

debate
have
yet
to
be
announced
so
far
there
have
only
been
three
qualifying
polls
released
since
the
start
of
the
november
debate's
polling
window
sept
but
biden
harris
warren
sanders
and
buttigieg
appear
to
be
locks
for
the
november
stage
they're
well
above
the
unique
donor
threshold
and
have
hit
at
least
percent
in
virtually
every
dnc
qualifying
poll
since
july
o'rourke's
campaign
has
the
donors
and
one
qualifying
poll
right
now
but
his
trajectory
in
recent
polls
also
puts
him
in
solid
shape
to
qualify
the
odds
are
a
murkier
for
the
rest
of
the
field
booker
already
has
two
qualifying
polls
of
at
least
percent
and
his
campaign
recently
began
an
aggressive
fundraising
push
but
his
campaign
manager
sounded
alarms
over
the
weekend
saying
in
a
memo
that
without
a
fundraising
surge
to
close
out
this
quarter
we
do
not
see
a
legitimate
long-term
path
forward
yang
only
hit
percent
in
one
of
the
three
qualifying
polls
though
he
had
previously
hit
that
mark
in
five
polls
over
the
past
six
weeks
klobuchar
has
only
hit
the
three
percent
threshold
twice
since
aug
once
since
the
start
of
the
november
window
both
castro
and
steyer
have
only
hit
that
percent
threshold
once
since
july
gabbard
has
never
hit
percent
in
a
qualifying
poll
it
also
seems
highly
unlikely
