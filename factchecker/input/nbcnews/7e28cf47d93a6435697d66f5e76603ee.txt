washington
president
donald
trump
showed
off
construction
of
part
of
his
border
wall
on
wednesday
during
a
trip
to
otay
mesa
california
calling
it
an
amazing
project
and
a
world-class
technology
system
i
think
really
the
success
is
going
to
be
when
the
wall's
built
when
the
human
traffickers
can't
come
through
trump
said
speaking
to
reporters
during
the
quick
visit
to
the
border
after
a
day
of
fundraisers
in
california
this
is
certainly
a
tremendous
national
emergency
trump
said
repeating
disputed
claims
about
the
threat
level
at
the
southern
border
during
the
tour
trump
praised
the
wall's
features
encouraging
tv
cameras
to
get
an
up-close
picture
of
the
slats
which
officials
said
were
constructed
out
of
steel
and
concrete
virtually
impenetrable
trump
described
them
trump
also
claimed
that
three
other
countries
were
currently
studying
the
u.s.
border
wall
but
declined
to
name
them
trump
said
that
world-class
mountain
climbers
tested
different
prototypes
of
the
wall
and
the
one
he
visited
wednesday
was
the
most
difficult
to
climb
this
is
the
one
that
was
hardest
to
climb
trump
said
this
wall
can't
be
climbed
trump
also
noted
that
the
wall
was
constructed
to
absorb
heat
making
the
surface
hot
to
the
touch
and
even
more
difficult
for
a
person
to
scale
you
can
fry
an
egg
on
that
wall
trump
said
his
visit
wednesday
intended
to
highlight
progress
on
his
signature
campaign
promise
came
in
the
wake
of
reporting

he
had
told
aides
that
he
would
pardon
those
found
to
have
taken
illegal
actions
in
an
effort
to
build
the
wall
the
president
also
faced
recent
criticism
that
his
focus
on
the
wall
might
be
jeopardizing
national
security
after
he
diverted
funds
from
over
military
construction
projects
to
pay
for
the
wall
earlier
this
week
the
washington
post
reported
that
trump's
wall
could
damage
archaeological
sites
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
according
to
a
report
from
the
national
park
service
when
asked
by
reporters
wednesday
if
he
had
hoped
to
have
more
of
the
wall
completed
by
this
point
in
his
presidency
trump
said
that
he
had
not
adding
that
you
couldn't
even
build
a
wall
across
the
entire
border
gesturing
to
natural
barriers
that
would
prevent
such
construction
trump
praised
mexico
for
their
dedication
to
border
security
wednesday
telling
reporters
that
they're
paying
for
soldiers
the
president
