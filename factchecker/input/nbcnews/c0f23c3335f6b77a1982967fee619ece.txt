washington
jason
greenblatt
is
leaving
as
president
donald
trump's
envoy
for
brokering
an
israeli-palestinian
peace
deal
senior
officials
told
nbc
news
on
thursday
his
departure
confirmed
by
the
president
on
twitter
is
the
latest
sign
that
optimism
within
the
trump
administration
for
the
long-awaited
plan's
prospects
may
be
fading
release
of
the
plan
under
development
since
the
start
of
administration
has
already
been
delayed
several
times
most
recently
until
sometime
after
the
israeli
elections
on
sept
avi
berkowitz
a
longtime
aide
to
trump
senior
adviser
and
son-in-law
jared
kushner
will
replace
greenblatt
in
his
role
as
special
adviser
for
international
negotiations
the
administration
officials
said
and
state
department
senior
adviser
brian
hook
who
has
spearheaded
the
administration's
iran
policy
efforts
is
expected
to
take
on
a
larger
role
on
the
peace
plan
and
work
more
closely
with
kushner
as
the
administration's
iran
policy
increasingly
merges
with
kushner's
peace
initiative
trump
confirmed
greenblatt's
departure
midday
thursday
saying
that
his
former
attorney
would
be
leaving
to
pursue
work
in
the
private
sector
greenblatt
is
expected
to
remain
with
the
administration
for
the
coming
weeks
if
not
months
officials
said
the
substance
of
the
plan
that
the
white
house
has
been
championing
for
months
remains
opaque
though
it
has
two
parts
one
to
address
economic
issues
and
the
other
dedicated
to
political
divides
the
economic
portion
of
the
plan
was
released
in
june
to
little
fanfare
during
a
u.s.
organized
summit
in
bahrain
that
neither
israeli
nor
palestinian
officials
attended
it
called
for
an
investment
of
about
billion
to
lift
up
palestinians
economically
yet
since
then
there
has
been
little
sign
of
progress
toward
rolling
out
the
broader
plan
that
will
address
the
thorniest
issues
such
as
whether
the
palestinians
will
get
an
independent
state
the
status
of
palestinian
refugees
the
city
of
jerusalem
and
jewish
settlements
in
the
west
bank
palestinian
officials
incensed
by
the
administration's
policies
toward
palestinians
have
already
rejected
the
plan
palestinian
leaders
and
the
white
house
have
not
formally
communicated
since
when
trump
infuriated
the
palestinians
by
recognizing
jerusalem
as
israel's
capital
and
moving
the
u.s.
embassy
there
in
a
reversal
of
longstanding
u.s.
policy
that
jerusalem's
future
should
be
determined
by
negotiations
the
palestinians
claim
part
of
jerusalem
for
the
capital
of
a
future
independent
state
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu's
political
troubles
at
home
have
also
created
significant
complications
for
the
plan
now
israel's
longest-serving
prime
minister
netanyahu
failed
to
put
together
a
governing
coalition
after
israel's
last
elections
in
april
leading
to
the
new
elections
this
month
i
would
like
to
thank
jason
greenblatt
for
his
dedicated
work
for
security
and
peace
and
for
never
hesitating
for
a
moment
to
speak
the
truth
about
the
state
of
israel
in
front
of
all
its
abusers
netanyahu
said
in
a
statement
in
hebrew
the
shift
coincides
with
rising
u.s.
iran
tensions
and
trump
saying
he's
willing
to
meet
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
within
weeks
iran
also
is
expect
to
be
a
large
focus
of
the
gathering
of
world
leaders
including
trump
in
new
york
this
month
for
the
united
nations
general
assembly
greenblatt
a
real
estate
lawyer
who
worked
for
trump's
business
for
roughly
two
decades
did
not
have
any
formal
diplomatic
experience
before
being
tapped
for
the
mideast
peace
envoy
role
at
the
start
of
the
trump
administration
