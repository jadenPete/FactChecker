judges
slam
gop
gerrymandering
in
stinging
ruling
reject
district
maps
the
ruling
found
state
legislative
boundaries
were
so
partisan
they
violated
the
state
constitution
a
panel
of
three
judges
in
north
carolina
threw
out
the
state's
legislative
district
maps
on
tuesday
ruling
that
the
maps
were
such
an
extreme
partisan
gerrymander
that
they
violated
the
state
constitution
lawmakers
partisan
intent
in
drawing
the
maps
the
surgical
precision
with
which
they
were
executed
and
the
distinct
advantage
the
maps
gave
to
republicans
violated
the
state's
constitutional
protections
of
free
elections
free
speech
and
assembly
and
equal
protection
under
the
law
the
judges
wrote
in
a
page
ruling
that
reads
as
a
stinging
condemnation
of
partisan
gerrymandering
the
enacted
maps
as
drawn
do
not
permit
voters
to
freely
choose
their
representative
but
rather
representatives
are
choosing
voters
based
upon
sophisticated
partisan
sorting
the
judges
wrote
it
is
not
the
free
will
of
the
people
that
is
ascertained
through
extreme
partisan
gerrymandering
rather
it
is
the
carefully
crafted
will
of
the
map
drawer
that
predominates
the
ruling
is
a
huge
win
for
voting
rights
advocates
who
say
that
gerrymandering
the
process
of
drawing
district
maps
to
favor
a
party
or
politician
undermines
democracy
by
allowing
lawmakers
to
pick
the
voters
while
racial
gerrymandering
is
illegal
the
supreme
court
declined
to
weigh
in
on
partisan
gerrymandering
earlier
this
summer
partisan
gerrymandering
in
north
carolina
presented
political
questions
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
courts
the
supreme
court
said
in
june
leaving
advocates
to
focus
their
fight
on
gerrymandering
in
state
courts
the
suit
was
filed
by
common
cause
a
watchdog
group
which
heralded
tuesday's
ruling
as
part
of
a
growing
list
of
victories
in
the
fight
to
end
gerrymandering
nationwide
in
a
statement
the
legislature
must
immediately
start
drawing
new
maps
the
court
said
demanding
that
they
be
drawn
based
on
criteria
like
population
contiguity
and
county
lines
they
must
be
drawn
without
partisan
considerations
and
election
results
data
the
judges
wrote
and
done
so
in
plain
view
a
pointed
departure
from
the
closed-door
processes
the
ruling
eschews
at
a
minimum
that
would
require
all
map
drawing
to
occur
at
public
hearings
with
any
relevant
computer
screen
visible
to
legislators
and
public
observers
the
ruling
said
new
maps
must
be
completed
in
two
weeks
the
judges
said
the
court
also
said
it
reserved
the
right
to
move
the
primary
election
if
needed
the
ruling
could
have
far-reaching
effects
it
both
demands
fairer
maps
and
also
has
the
potential
to
change
who
is
charged
with
drawing
north
carolina's
next
set
of
redistricting
maps
because
lawmakers
will
redraw
the
maps
after
the
census
control
of
the
north
carolina
legislature
is
much
more
a
jump
ball
under
new
maps
michael
li
senior
counsel
at
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
new
york
university
told
nbc
news
the
new
legislature
that's
elected
in
will
draw
the
maps
in
stanton
jones
an
attorney
for
common
cause
said
tuesday's
ruling
could
affect
the
state's
congressional
districts
too
north
carolina
a
purple
state
is
currently
represented
by
republicans
and
three
democrats
in
congress
thanks
to
careful
republican-drawn
districts
that
advocates
say
are
heavily
gerrymandered
today's
decision
does
not
directly
address
the
congressional
district
however
this
decision
interprets
and
applies
the
north
carolina
constitution
to
prohibit
partisan
gerrymandering
and
that
ruling
should
apply
equally
in
the
constitution
to
state
legislative
district
sand
congressional
districting
plans
jones
told
reporters
north
carolina's
maps
are
among
some
of
the
most
gerrymandered
in
the
nation
something
that
was
highlighted
by
the
election
the
ruling
said
in
the
house
and
senate
elections
republican
candidates
won
a
minority
of
the
two-party
statewide
vote
but
still
won
majority
of
state
house
and
senate
seats
lawmakers
have
been
gerrymandering
for
centuries
in
the
u.s.
but
sophisticated
data
computer
modeling
and
hyper
partisanship
has
made
gerrymandered
maps
more
effective
over
the
years
making
the
maps
more
powerful
and
their
effect
on
democracy
more
profound
