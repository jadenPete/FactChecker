this
supreme
court
allows
trump
administration
to
enforce
toughest
restriction
yet
on
asylum
requests
a
lawsuit
to
stop
the
new
policy
is
still
working
its

through
the
lower
courts
the
u.s.
supreme
court
late
wednesday
gave
the
trump
administration
permission
to
enforce
its
toughest
restriction
yet
on
asylum
seekers
at
the
southern
border
even
though
a
lawsuit
to
stop
the
new
policy
is
still
working
its
way
through
the
lower
courts
as
a
result
the
government
can
now
refuse
to
consider
a
request
for
asylum
from
anyone
who
failed
to
apply
for
it
in
another
country
after
leaving
home
but
before
coming
here
the
order
means
for
instance
that
migrants
from
honduras
guatemala
and
el
salvador
cannot
seek
asylum
in
the
u.s.
if
they
didn't
first
ask
for
it
in
mexico
justices
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
sonia
sotomayor
dissented
saying
the
court
acted
too
quickly
and
should
allow
the
case
to
work
its
way
through
the
normal
judicial
process
the
administration
said
the
new
restriction
is
needed
to
respond
to
an
unprecedented
surge
of
people
who
enter
the
country
illegally
and
seek
asylum
if
they're
caught
but
officials
said
only
a
small
fraction
of
them
are
eventually
found
to
be
qualified
the
rule
thus
screens
out
asylum
seekers
who
declined
to
request
protection
at
their
first
opportunity
said
solicitor
general
noel
francisco
he
said
it
allows
immigration
officials
to
concentrate
on
the
asylum
seekers
who
most
need
protection

immigration
courts
now
face
a
backlog
of
asylum
requests
but
given
how
few
are
actually
granted
it's
reasonable
to
ask
whether
those
applicants
genuinely
fear
persecution
or
torture
or
are
simply
economic
migrants
francisco
said
after
the
new
policy
was
announced
in
july
a
federal
judge
in
california
blocked
its
enforcement
ruling
that
it
would
violate
existing
immigration
law
and
was
improperly
rushed
into
effect
the
justice
department
took
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco
but
also
asked
the
supreme
court
to
let
the
government
carry
out
the
restrictions
while
the
case
is
on
appeal
the
aclu
representing
immigrant
rights
groups
said
the
new
policy
would
violate
a
federal
law
in
effect
since
that
allows
denying
asylum
claims
only
when
applicants
who
have
been
firmly
resettled
in
a
third
country
or
when
the
us
has
signed
a
safe-third-country
agreement
with
another
nation
no
such
agreement
has
been
signed
with
mexico
the
trump
administration's
restriction
bars
virtually
every
non-mexican
asylum
seeker
who
enters
through
the
southern
land
border
the
aclu
told
the
supreme
court
regardless
of
whether
the
applicant
could
have
safely
sought
asylum
in
another
country
the
court
should
not
permit
such
a
tectonic
change
to
us
asylum
law
especially
at
this
early
stage
in
the
legal
battle
the
group
said
it's
the
second
recent
immigration-related
victory
for
the
trump
administration
before
the
supreme
court
in
july
the
justices
lifted
a
lower
court
order
that
had
blocked
the
government
from
using
pentagon
construction
money
to
build
part
of
the
border
wall
on
the
mexican
border
the
trump
administration
celebrated
the
victory
later
on
wednesday
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
will
commence
implementing
the
asylum
rule
asap
the
agency's
acting
director
ken
cuccinelli
said
in
a
tweet
asylum
is
a
form
of
humanitarian
relief
recognized
under
international
law
as
a
signatory
to
an
international
asylum
treaty
the
u.s.
has
a
legal
obligation
to
provide
protection
and
certain
rights
to
people
who
arrive
at
the
border
seeking
asylum
people
may
request
it
if
they
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
return
to
their
home
countries
because
they
have
been
persecuted
there
in
the
past
or
have
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
if
they
return
and
the
reason
for
the
persecution
is
connected
to
race
religion
nationality
membership
in
a
particular
social
group
or
political
opinion
an
earlier
move
by
the
trump
administration
to
restrict
asylum
remains
blocked
by
the
courts
it
would
have
denied
the
protection
to
anyone
who
did
not
enter
the
us
through
a
legal
port
of
entry
dissenting
from
wednesday's
order
justices
sotomayor
joined
by
justice
ginsburg
said
the
new
asylum
policy
seeks
to
upend
longstanding
practices
regarding
refugees
who
seek
shelter
from
persecution
although
this
nation
has
long
kept
its
doors
open
to
refugees
and
although
the
stakes
for
asylum
seekers
could
not
be
higher
the
govern
ment
implemented
its
rule
without
first
providing
the
pub
lic
notice
and
inviting
the
public
input
generally
required
by
law
