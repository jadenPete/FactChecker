asks
judge
to
toss
trump
bid
to
keep
tax
returns
secret
trump
is
seeking
to
invent
and
enforce
a
new
presidential
tax
return
privilege
the
new
york
prosecutors
said
prosecutors
from
the
manhattan
district
attorney's
office
want
a
judge
to
throw
out
president
donald
trump's
bid
to
block
them
from
looking
at
his
personal
and
corporate
tax
returns
the
office
of
manhattan
d.a.
cyrus
vance
subpoenaed
trump's
accountants
for
the
returns
late
last
month
as
part
of
a
criminal
investigation
into
the
trump
organization
over
hush
money
payments
made
to
two
women
who
had
alleged
affairs
with
the
president
trump
has
denied
the
affairs
trump's
lawyers
filed
suit
in
federal
court
to
block
the
request
arguing
in
part
that
vance
isn't
entitled
to
the
returns
and
that
v
irtually
all
legal
commenters
agree
that
a
sitting
president
of
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
the
criminal
process
while
he
is
in
office
in
its
filing
with
the
judge
on
monday
vance's
office
said
the
argument
lacks
merit
and
must
be
dismissed
trump's
claims
rely
on
the
remarkable
proposition
that
a
sitting
president
enjoys
not
only
a
blanket
immunity
from
criminal
prosecution
but
that
this
blanket
immunity
also
protects
a
president
from
having
to
respond
to
any
routine
lawful
grand
jury
request
for
information
about
his
conduct
or
that
of
his
businesses
or
employees
before
he
took
office
that
the
blanket
immunity
also
extends
to
any
person
or
entity
who
happened
to
be
associated
with
or
employed
by
the
president
before
he
took
office
and
that
this
blanket
immunity
also
prevents
any
third
party
from
providing
information
to
the
grand
jury
about
such
prior
conduct
or
transactions
involving
the
president
or
his
companies
or
former
employees
the
filing
says
t
he
law
provides
no
such
sweeping
immunity
the
prosecutors
said
they
also
argued
that
the
case
should
be
tossed
because
it's
a
state
case
not
federal
and
that
the
argument
by
trump's
lawyers
that
he'd
be
irreparably
harmed
by
the
handover
is
without
merit
trump
the
filing
says
is
seeking
to
invent
and
enforce
a
new
presidential
tax
return
privilege
on
the
theory
that
disclosing
information
in
a
tax
return
will
necessarily
reveal
information
that
will
somehow
impede
the
functioning
of
a
president
sufficiently
to
meet
the
test
of
irreparable
harm
they
noted
that
they
want
the
returns
for
their
investigation
not
to
make
them
public
the
scope
of
the
d.a.
s
probe
is
unclear
prosecutors
have
asked
for
years
of
tax
returns
which
would
pre-date
the
payments
to
porn
star
stormy
daniels
and
playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
one
of
the
d.a.
s
filings
notes
that
the
investigation
targets
new
york
conduct
and
has
yet
to
conclude
as
to
specific
charges
or
defendants
that
section
is
followed
by
two
pages
that
have
been
redacted
in
the
public
filing
to
date
the
filings
say
the
trump
organization
has
provided
responsive
pages
already
to
the
d.a.
s
subpoenas
and
inquiries
into
the
hush
money
payments
but
no
tax
records
