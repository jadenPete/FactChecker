voters
go
center-left
on
issues
but
not
on
candidates
if
democratic
candidates
push
too
hard
in
the
primaries
they
may
find
themselves
with

in
the
general
election
washington
when
it
comes
to
issues
and
issue
agendas
there
is
good
news
and
bad
news
for
democrats
in
in
the
latest
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
on
the
good
news
side
of
the
ledger
there
some
key
issues
where
voters
seem
supportive
of
left-leaning
ideas
and
approaches
the
bad
news
a
leftward-lean
does
not
mean
a
leftward
rush
if
democratic
candidates
push
too
hard
in
the
primaries
they
may
find
themselves
with
problems
in
the
general
election
the
issue
agreements
and
differences
with
registered
voters
and
democratic
primary
voters
are
eye-opening
and
in
some
cases
surprising
one
number
that
jumps
out
of
the
data
percent
of
registered
voters
in
the
survey
say
they
support
providing
free
tuition
at
state
colleges
and
universities
that's
lower
than
the
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
who
support
the
idea
and
there's
a
lot
of
wiggle
room
in
how
respondents
may
have
interpreted
the
question
would
it
be
means-tested
but
it's
still
a
majority
and
there
are
a
series
of
issues
like
that
one
where
democrats
seem
to
have
registered
voters
in
their
corner
on
topics
ranging
from
immigration
and
student
debt
to
health
care
and
the
environment
for
instance
percent
of
registered
voters
and
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
say
they
favor
allowing
young
adults
who
were
brought
illegally
to
this
country
to
stay
here
to
attend
college
on
student
debt
percent
of
registered
voters
and
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
favor
forgiving
student
loans
after
someone
has
paid
percent
of
their
income
every
year
for
years
the
two
groups
are
also
in
agreement
on
offering
a
health
insurance
public
option
for
people
younger
than
who
want
to
buy
into
it
percent
and
percent
favor
that
idea
respectively
and
both
registered
voters
and
democratic
primary
voters
favor
shifting
the
country
to
percent
renewable
energy
and
stopping
the
use
of
coal
oil
natural
gas
and
nuclear
power
by
the
year
percent
and
percent
support
that
idea
those
are
numbers
that
should
bring
smiles
to
the
faces
of
democrats
they
show
a
lot
of
broad
support
on
some
major
issues
that
democrats
say
they
favor
and
seem
to
suggest
democrats
are
in
a
good
spot
to
win
voters
in
for
the
record
the
data
also
show
that
both
registered
voters
and
democratic
primary
voters
oppose
building
a
wall
on
the
u.s.
mexico
border
and
oppose
eliminating
the
affordable
care
act
but
there
is
another
set
of
numbers
in
the
poll
that
show
the
challenges
democrats
could
face
on
these
same
issues
if
their
nominee
heads
down
a
path
that
goes
a
little
further
to
the
left
on
immigration
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
want
to
give
undocumented
immigrants
government
health
care
only
percent
of
registered
voters
want
that
when
it
comes
to
student
debt
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
say
they
favor
immediately
canceling
and
forgiving
all
current
student
loan
debt
but
only
percent
of
registered
voters
support
that
idea
a
solid
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
back
a
medicare
for
all
single-payer
health
care
system
in
which
private
health
insurance
would
be
eliminated
only
percent
of
registered
voters
agree
and
while
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
support
an
end
to
the
practice
of
fracking
for
oil
and
gas
production
only
percent
of
registered
voters
feel
the
same
way
those
are
some
wide
gaps
and
the
splits
show
that
winning
general
election
support
is
not
just
about
talking
about
the
right
issues
clean
energy
fixing
student
debt
it's
about
talking
about
them
in
the
right
way
the
registered
voter
answers
on
these
questions
suggest
that
the
u.s.
electorate
become
a
center-left
entity
in
the
last
few
elections
one
that
is
embracing
more
liberal
action
on
issues
such
as
climate
change
health
care
and
college
costs
but
these
numbers
also
suggest
that
the
center-left
is
not
the
left
and
that's
where
many
democratic
primary
voters
reside
the
next
six
to
eight
months
will
determine
where
the
democratic
nominee
eventually
ends
up
on
these
issues
and
if
the
party's
nominee
moves
too
far
too
fast
to
placate
primary
voters
he
or
she
may
end
up
standing
on
uncomfortable
ground
next
november
