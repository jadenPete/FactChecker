gen
joseph
f.
dunford
jr
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of

described
the
troop
deployment
as
modest
and
not
thousands

said
he
planned
to
confer
with
u.s.
central

and
saudi
officials
to
work
out
details
of
the
deployment
which
he
said

and

the
defense
secretary
said
the
troop
deployment
to
those
nations
is
happening
as
iran
has
engaged
in
a
significant
escalation
of
violence
in
the
region
on
wednesday
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
that
while
yemen's
iranian-backed
houthi
rebels
claimed
responsibility
for
the
saudi
oil-site
attack
the
fingerprints
of
tehran's
ayatollah
were
evident
in
the
drone
strikes
esper
on
friday
took
that
line
of
thinking
further
saying
the
weapons
used
in
the
iranian
attack
were
iranian
produced
and
were
not
launched
from
yemen
as
was
initially
claimed
however
he
emphasized
that
saudi
arabia
is
leading
the
investigation
into
the
attack
we
will
keep
them
in
the
lead
with
regard
to
the
forensics
so
we
need
to
let
that
play
out
let
the
evidence
play
out
esper
said
iran's
powerful
revolutionary
guard
responded
saturday
with
its
chief
commander

it
is
ready
for
combat

any
scenario

iran

said
that
his
forces
have
carried
out
war
exercises
and
are
ready
for
any
scenario
he
added
if
anyone
crosses
our
borders
we
will
hit
them
the
troop
buildup
in
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
supplements
sanctions
against
the
iranian
banking
system
on
friday
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
told
reporters
the
central
bank
of
iran
and
the
country's
sovereign
wealth
fund
the
national
development
fund
will
be
cut
off
from
our
banking
system
we
are
continuing
the
maximum
pressure
campaign
he
said
esper
expressed
hope
that
the
military
show
of
force
would
prevent
further
escalation
as
the
president
has
made
clear
the
united
states
does
not
seek
conflict
with
iran
esper
said
that
said
we
have
many
other
military
options
available
should
they
be
necessary
saudi
arabia
requested
what
the
secretary
described
as
extra
defensive
support
he
said
and
it
will
send
a
clear
message
that
the
united
states
supports
our
partners
in
the
region
the
move
was
also
made
with
commerce
in
mind
as
the
attack
included
as
a
target
the
world's
largest
oil
processing
facility
the
extra
troops
would
help
ensure
the
support
free
flow
or
resources
necessary
to
support
the
global
economy
