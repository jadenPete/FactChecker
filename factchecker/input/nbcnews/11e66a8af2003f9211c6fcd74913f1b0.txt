share
this
trump
administration
allows
pork
slaughterhouses
to
have
fewer
usda
inspectors
the
new
rule
also
allows
plants
to
run
their
processing
lines
as
fast
as
they
like
the
trump
administration
will
allow
pork
plants
to
reduce
the
number
of
department
of
agriculture
line
inspectors
assigned
to
them
and
run
their
slaughter
lines
without
any
speed
limit
under
a
new
rule
intended
to
modernize
an
antiquated
inspection
system
but
the
changes
have
alarmed
consumer
advocates
who
believe
the
rule
will
make
food
less
safe
and
endanger
workers
the
new
rule
will
let
factory
workers
rather
than
usda
inspectors
remove
unsuitable
carcasses
and
trim
defects
in
plants
that
opt
into
the
new
inspection
system
usda
inspectors
will
still
examine
the
carcasses
but
they
will
be
stationed
farther
down
the
line
and
off-line
inspectors
will
be
roaming
the
factory
to
conduct
other
kinds
of
safety
checks
this
regulatory
change
allows
us
to
ensure
food
safety
while
eliminating
outdated
rules
and
allowing
for
companies
to
innovate
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
unveiling
the
new
rule
the
usda
says
that
the
rule
is
the
first
time
in
more
than
years
that
pork
inspections
will
be
modernized
making
food
safer
by
focusing
inspectors
attention
on
more
targeted
safety
checks
rather
than
visual
line
inspections
the
agency
estimates
that
the
change
will
reduce
the
total
number
of
usda
inspectors
at
pork
plants
by
percent
saving
about
million
a
year
industry
groups
cheered
the
usda's
announcement
which
comes
more
than
years
after
the
federal
government
launched
a
pilot
program
to
test
the
new
system
we
applaud
the
usda
for
introducing
a
new
inspection
system
that
incentivizes
investment
in
new
technologies
while
ensuring
a
safe
supply
of
wholesome
american
pork
david
herring
president
of
the
national
pork
producers
council
said
in
a
statement
but
consumer
advocates
fear
that
factory
workers
will
not
be
as
well
trained
or
independent
as
usda
inspectors
and
that
they
could
miss
critical
signs
of
disease
and
contamination
endangering
the
public
this
rule
puts
industry
profits
ahead
of
public
health
said
thomas
gremillion
director
of
food
policy
for
the
consumer
federation
of
america
an
advocacy
group
he
called
the
rule
a
recipe
for
food
safety
disaster
the
usda
insists
that
public
health
will
continue
to
be
protected
as
agency
inspectors
will
still
be
stationed
close
to
factory
employees
to
oversee
the
work
that
they
do
in
the
pilot
program
the
agency
said
usda
inspectors
conducted
more
checks
for
contaminants
than
under
the
old
system
the
obama
administration
made
a
similar
change
to
modernize
poultry
inspections
in
but
decided
against
raising
the
maximum
line
speed
limit
after
an
outcry
from
worker
safety
advocates
the
trump
administration
by
contrast
is
doing
away
with
speed
limits
altogether
in
pork
plants
that
participate
in
the
new
inspection
system
debbie
berkowitz
a
former
labor
department
official
under
the
obama
administration
says
the
change
will
harm
workers
who
are
already
laboring
under
dangerous
conditions
in
traditional
plants
which
are
currently
allowed
to
process
up
to
hogs
per
hour
the
rule
will
lead
to
an
increase
in
serious
and
often
crippling
injuries
to
tens
of
thousands
of
slaughterhouse
workers
who
already
endure
exceedingly
harsh
conditions
to
provide
cheap
pork
to
american
consumers
said
berkowitz
a
program
director
at
the
national
employment
law
project
a
research
and
advocacy
group
the
trump
administration
is
rigging
the
rules
against
our
nation's
packinghouse
workers
and
sacrificing
their
health
to
benefit
narrow
corporate
interests
advocates
also
criticized
the
usda
for
moving
forward
with
the
rule
amid
a
probe
by
the
agency's
inspector
general
who
is
examining
whether
the
usda
used
faulty
data
and
hid
information
about
the
new
rule's
impact
on
worker
safety
the
usda
is
currently
developing
similar
changes
to
beef
inspections
