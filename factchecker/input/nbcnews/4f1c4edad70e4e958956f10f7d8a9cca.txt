washington
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
sunday
that
the
u.s.
has
withdrawn
its
special
envoy
to
peace
talks
in
afghanistan
after
president
donald
trump
scuttled
plans
for
negotiations
with
the
taliban
and
afghan
government
at
camp
david
sunday
and
pompeo
warned
that
things
are
about
to
get
worse
for
the
taliban
in
the
wake
of
an
attack
that
killed
a
u.s.
service
member
last
week
during
an
appearance
on
nbc's
meet
the
press
pompeo
said
that
talks
are
absolutely
off
between
the
parties
for
the
time
being
after
trump
canceled
a
planned
secret
summit
on
saturday
in
a
series
of
tweets
the
president
specifically
blamed
the
decision
to
scrap
a
planned
meeting
at
camp
david
on
a
recent
car
bomb
attack
in
afghanistan
which
the
taliban
took
credit
for
and
killed
a
u.s.
service
member
we
had
been
working
on
this
meeting
for
a
little
while
pompeo
said
but
the
attack
was
something
president
trump
could
never
stand
for
and
we
informed
both
president
ashraf
ghani
and
our
taliban
interlocutors
that
these
meetings
were
not
going
to
take
place
he
said
pompeo
said
that
american
forces
have
killed
over
taliban
in
the
last
ten
days
and
that
while
this
is
not
a
war
of
attrition
i
want
the
american
people
to
know
that
president
trump
is
taking
it
to
the
taliban
and
he
warned
that
the
recent
attack
and
the
lack
of
negotiations
would
prove
damaging
to
the
taliban
if
you're
the
taliban
conditions
have
been
worsening
and
are
about
to
get
worse
he
said
we
are
going
to
make
sure
everyone
in
the
region
understands
that
america
will
always
protect
its
national
security
interests
i'll
leave
to
the
department
of
defense
to
talk
about
specifics
but
no
one
should
underestimate
president
trump's
commitment
during
his
interview
pompeo
repeatedly
pointed
to
the
car
bomb
attack
as
the
reason
for
the
cancellation
of
the
planned
peace
talks
and
denied
that
any
hesitation
by
the
afghan
government
prompted
the
decision
instead
a
senior
taliban
leader
in
afghanistan
told
nbc
news
that
the
group
was
surprised
by
the
cancelation
the
scuttled
meeting
had
been
part
of
the
trump
administration's
attempts
to
negotiate
a
peace
deal
in
afghanistan
that
could
wind
down
america's
presence
in
the
country
american
troops
have
been
a
constant
presence
in
afghanistan
since
the
weeks
after
the
attacks
about
americans
have
been
killed
in
afghanistan
and
american
troops
remain
in
the
country
but
those
negotiations
have
been
rocky
former
u.s.
diplomats
warned
earlier
this
month
that
withdrawing
american
troops
before
the
taliban
and
the
afghan
government
reached
a
peace
deal
could
lead
to
a
return
to
the
total
civil
war
that
consumed
afghanistan
and
nbc
news
reported
last
week
that
u.s.
special
envoy
zalmay
khalilzad
clashed
with
afghan
government
officials
over
a
proposed
deal
to
withdraw
troops
in
order
to
bring
the
taliban
to
the
negotiating
table
pompeo
said
sunday
that
khalilzad
was
recalled
back
to
america
in
response
to
the
scuttled
talks
sen
roy
blunt
r-mo
told
meet
the
press
that
he
believes
the
situation
in
afghanistan
would
get
worse
if
american
troops
pulled
out
and
raised
concerns
about
negotiating
with
the
taliban
backing
away
from
where
we
were
just
dealing
with
the
taliban
was
the
right
thing
to
do
leaving
troops
there
for
now
is
the
right
thing
to
do
blunt
said
the
taliban
as
the
president
pointed
out
yesterday
even
in
the
middle
of
a
negotiation
has
to
brag
about
killing
an
american
soldier
if
we
leave
there
that
becomes
the
same
haven
it
was
