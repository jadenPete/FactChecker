democrats
speak
out
about
impeachment
as
house
inquiry
ramps
up
i
really
feel
confident
that
they
are
in
the
process
of
getting
everybody
else
who
is
still
lagging
to
come
along
said
rep
ilhan
omar
d-minn
democrats
on
sunday
addressed
the
mounting
confusion
over
the
house
impeachment
probe
following
a
key
vote
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
this
week
which
came
as
lawmakers
delivered
mixed
messages
on
the
panel's
high-profile
inquiry
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
confusion
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
told
fox
news
sunday
the
judiciary
committee
has
been
engaged
in
the
work
of
our
committee
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
we're
looking
at
obstruction
of
justice
abuse
of
power
corruption
broadly
we've
engaged
in
hearings
we're
going
to
continue
to
bring
witnesses
before
the
committee
compel
the
production
of
documents
to
make
clear
no
one
in
this
country
is
above
the
law
cicilline
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
said
the
panel
will
follow
the
facts
and
at
the
conclusion
make
a
recommendation
on
thursday
the
judiciary
committee
passed
a
resolution
along
party
lines
setting
procedures
and
rules
for
future
impeachment
investigation
hearings
at
the
time
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
said
some
people
called
the
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
while
others
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
he
said
lawmakers
are
split
on
whether
the
investigation
counts
as
an
impeachment
probe
without
a
house
vote
authorizing
it
as
such
nadler
contends
that
it
can
be
designated
as
an
impeachment
investigation
simply
because
they
are
considering
articles
of
impeachment
that
distinction
could
play
a
role
in
the
committee's
ability
to
obtain
grand
jury
information
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
probe
while
there
is
no
deadline
for
recommending
articles
of
impeachment
democratic
aides
have
signaled
that
the
goal
is
to
come
to
a
decision
by
the
end
of
the
year
more
than
half
of
house
democrats
favor
an
impeachment
probe
in
an
interview
with
cbs's
face
the
nation
on
sunday
house
intelligence
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
was
asked
if
he
could
clarify
whether
or
not
an
impeachment
investigation
is
taking
place
as
opposed
to
standard
committee
oversight
yes
we're
doing
an
investigation
that
will
ultimately
determine
whether
the
president
should
be
impeached
he
said
adding
there's
certainly
an
investigation
underway
now
this
is
about
more
than
just
message
he
added
there
are
some
of
our
members
who
are
ready
to
vote
to
impeach
and
remove
the
president
tomorrow
and
there
are
some
who
believe
that
we
should
not
impeach
him
because
it
will
be
a
failed
exercise
in
the
senate
but
the
vast
majority
of
our
caucus
including
our
leadership
is
of
the
view
that
we
should
do
the
investigation
before
we
determine
whether
the
president
should
be
impeached
that's
the
category
that
i
fit
in
and
that's
the
work
that
we're
doing
elsewhere
on
face
the
nation
rep
ilhan
omar
d-minn
said
it
wasn't
if
we
were
going
to
impeach
it's
when
we
were
going
to
impeach
and
i
think
it
is
okay
for
some
people
to
have
hesitations
for
other
people
to
catch
up
to
where
some
of
us
have
been
for
a
really
long
time
omar
said
decisions
are
being
made
as
more
than
half
of
democrats
support
an
inquiry
this
is
why
they
took
the
vote
to
begin
the
investigation
she
said
and
i
really
feel
confident
that
they
are
in
the
process
of
getting
everybody
else
who
is
still
lagging
to
come
along
