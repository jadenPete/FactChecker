of
error
among

caucus-goers
warren
percent
up
points
since
june
biden
percent
down
sanders
percent
down
but
warren
overtaking
biden
in
iowa
within
the
margin
of
error
shouldn't
be
surprising
given
that
much
of
biden's
strength
in
national

comes
from

nbc's
benjy
sarlin
observes
most
of
the
top-polling
democrats
have
put
out
climate
plans
in
the
last
month
that
call
for
phasing
out
production
of
fossil-fueled
cars
by
a
set
date
either
or
warren
harris
sanders
buttigieg
and
booker
all
are
on
board
with
the
concept
biden
doesn't
name
a
year
but
his
plan
calls
for
big
spending
on
charging
stations
and
purchase
incentives
the
trump
administration
is
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
trying
to
undo
obama-era
efficiency
regulations
and
block
california
and
automakers
from
negotiating
stricter
rules
on
their
own
the
president
seems
very
personally
invested
in
this
fight
why
democrats
should
be
concerned
a
poll
by
left-leaning
data
for
progress
in
march
found
americans
opposed
an
electric
car
mandate
by
a
point
margin
cars
seem
like
a
natural
culture
war
front
and
trump
is
already
mocking
electric
vehicles
at
rallies
why
democrats
should
be
optimistic
big
business
might
actually
be
on
the
party's
side
on
this
one
at
least
in
the
auto
industry
the
major
car
companies
are
betting
hard
on
electric
vehicles
in
part
because
countries
in
europe
and
asia
are
already
pursuing
similar
rules
expect
a
lot
of
ad
dollars
selling
customers
on
the
concept
as
more
electric
models
roll
out
amazon

just
announced
it
