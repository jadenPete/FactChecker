tweet
sparked
controversy
online
and
on
television
including
a
tense
exchange
tuesday
on
abc's
the
view
during
which
whoopi
goldberg
compared
messing's
demand
to
mccarthy's
hollywood
blacklist
of
the
s
which
led
to
the
denial
of
employment
to
hundreds
of
people
in
the
movie
and
television
industry
who
were
believed
to
be
associated
with
communism
in
his
tweets
on
thursday
trump
also
wrote
that
messing
was
being
accused
of
being
a
racist
because
of
the
terrible
things
she
said
about
blacks
and
mental
illness
that
apparently
referred
to
another
saturday
post
by
messing
in

she
re-tweeted
a
story
about
an
alabama
church
that
had
erected
a
sign

a
black
vote
for
trump

mental
illness
messing
has
since
deleted
that
re-tweet
in
his
tweets
trump
went
on
to
call
on
nbc
to
fire
messing
and
compared
her
situation
to
the
one
that
unfolded
for
roseanne
barr
who
was
fired
from
abc
last
year
after
posting
a
racist
tweet
if
roseanne
barr
said
what
she
did
even
being
on
a
much
higher
rated
show
she
would
have
been
thrown
off

under
a
different

without
