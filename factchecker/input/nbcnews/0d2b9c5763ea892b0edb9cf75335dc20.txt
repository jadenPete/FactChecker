share
this
impressive
and
a
little
scary
how
amazon
and
jeff
bezos
made
washington
a
second
home
many
companies
have
cozied
up
to
the
nation's
capital
but
none
have
accrued
the
kind
of
presence
and
reach
that
amazon
will
soon
boast
in
just
about
every
direction
the
white
house
is
surrounded
by
e-commerce
giant
amazon
and
its
ceo
jeff
bezos
almost
due
west
from
the
executive
mansion
is
amazon
books
a
brick-and-mortar
version
of
its
e-commerce
destination
the
million
mansion
owned
by
amazon
ceo
jeff
bezos
is
a
minute
drive
to
the
northwest
the
washington
post
owned
by
bezos
is
a
short
walk
to
the
northeast
amazon's
washington
headquarters
is
just
to
the
east
head
a
bit
farther
south
across
the
potomac
river
into
virginia
and
there's
crystal
city
soon
to
be
renamed
national
landing
once
amazon
makes
it
home
to
its
massive
second
headquarters
or
hq
investment
even
beyond
that
the
outskirts
of
the
city
a
northern
virginia
area
that
has
been
described
as
the
bull's-eye
of
america's
internet
is
home
to
of
the
company's
amazon
web
services
data
centers
on
a
map
it
can
look
like
a
pending
invasion
of
the
nation's
capital
but
amazon
is
already
deeply
embedded
in
washington
and
has
plans
to
further
entrench
itself
in
the
nation's
capital
putting
it
close
to
power
brokers
as
well
as
billions
of
dollars
in
government
contracts
while
major
tech
companies
have
ingrained
themselves
in
the
capital
in
recent
years
none
are
as
present
as
amazon
according
to
policy
and
lobbying
experts
who
spoke
to
nbc
news
many
companies
have
cozied
up
to
washington
but
none
have
accrued
the
kind
of
presence
and
reach
that
amazon
will
soon
boast
and
with
good
reason
amazon's
government
interests
expand
well
beyond
lobbying
it
is
now
facing
growing
calls
to
be
broken
up
by
the
federal
government
while
also
bidding
for
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
government
contracts
i
think
they
see
there
is
a
lot
of
profit
to
be
made
in
government
contracts
and
want
to
be
part
of
that
said
frank
pasquale
a
university
of
maryland
law
professor
maybe
some
of
the
amazon
executives
in
the
area
will
end
up
going
to
the
same
country
club
as
antitrust
or
tax
policymakers
and
end
up
offering
jobs
or
internships
to
bureaucrats
or
political
appointees
kids
or
engage
in
similar
soft
corruption
there
are
a
lot
of
opportunities
for
influence
once
you
get
your
own
people
insinuated
into
the
elite
clubs
schools
and
other
social
venues
in
d.c.
amazon's
washington
operation
is
headlined
by
the
upcoming
arrival
of
hq
which
the
company
opted
to
place
in
the
area
after
what
amounted
to
a
nationwide
competition
amazon
initially
announced
a
separate
second
headquarters
in
new
york
city
but
withdrew
amid
political
pressure
over
subsidies
the
state
had
offered
to
lure
the
company
as
a
result
of
hq
amazon
has
pledged
to
deliver
new
jobs
in
the
virginia
area
over
the
next
decade
david
fontana
a
george
washington
university
law
professor
said
the
company
was
making
fairly
standard
moves
early
on
building
up
a
lobbying
presence
and
hiring
washington
insiders
to
do
d.c.
work
but
with
hq
the
company
is
bringing
the
business
side
of
their
operation
in
as
well
as
he
put
it
there's
nothing
like
the
influx
of
private
sector
jobs
amazon
is
planning
in
the
nation's
capital
in
the
city's
history
that's
a
big
line
to
cross
fontana
said
an
amazon
spokesperson
said
the
company
decided
to
locate
in
virginia
because
of
the
state's
business-friendly
environment
and
its
belief
that
it
will
be
able
to
attract
world-class
talent
to
the
area
its
proximity
to
d.c.
did
not
influence
our
hq
decision
the
spokesperson
said
when
it
comes
to
lobbying
amazon
lobbied
more
government
entities
than
any
tech
company
last
year
bloomberg
reported
so
far
in
it's
spent
more
on
lobbying
than
any
tech
company
at
more
than
million
after
spending
a
record
million
in
according
to
the
center
for
responsive
politics
as
bloomberg
noted
amazon
has
increased
its
lobbying
spending
by
more
than
percent
since
while
the
company's
roster
of
in-house
lobbyists
has
nearly
tripled
since
the
company
has
lobbied
the
government
on
an
array
of
issues
like
taxes
trade
immigration
and
defense
while
amazon's
lobbying
efforts
are
expansive
and
growing
they
are
comparable
to
companies
like
facebook
northrop
grumman
and
at
t.
and
though
amazon's
expansion
into
the
washington
market
will
outpace
other
private
sector
employers
defense
contractors
and
other
large
businesses
have
populated
the
land
between
the
anacostia
and
potomac
rivers
for
some
time
viewing
the
nation's
capital
as
essential
to
their
core
business
amazon
provides
a
wide
range
of
products
and
services
for
our
customers
and
we're
always
looking
for
ways
to
innovate
on
their
behalf
an
amazon
spokesperson
told
nbc
news
our
washington
d.c.
team
is
focused
on
ensuring
we
are
advocating
on
issues
that
are
important
to
our
customers
our
employees
and
policymakers
but
amazon
isn't
quite
comparable
to
other
companies
according
to
terry
schilling
executive
director
of
the
american
principles
project
a
conservative
think
tank
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
a
corporation
like
a
single
corporation
have
this
type
of
impact
and
influence
on
public
policy
from
a
federal
all
the
way
down
to
a
state
and
local
level
schilling
said
and
it's
very
impressive
and
a
little
scary
what
does
amazon
care
about
for
starters
getting
government
agencies
to
use
its
cloud
computing
services
and
buy
supplies
from
its
site
observers
say
the
company
dove
headfirst
into
the
government
contracting
competition
most
prominently
seeking
a
cloud
computing
contract
with
the
pentagon
worth
up
to
billion
after
having
locked
down
a
similar
slightly
less-lucrative
contract
with
the
cia
earlier
in
the
decade
but
that
contract
has
also
shown
that
some
politicians
are
growing
wary
of
amazon's
power
last
month
defense
secretary
mark
esper
launched
a
review
of
the
bidding
process
after
amazon's
competitors
like
ibm
and
oracle
complained
that
the
terms
for
the
contract
were
unfairly
designed
to
benefit
amazon
a
claim
that
a
federal
judge
and
the
government
accountability
office
ruled
against
that
also
came
after
the
white
house
demanded
such
a
review
something
that
leading
republicans
on
capitol
hill
like
sen
marco
rubio
r-fla
have
pushed
for
as
well
rubio
wrote
esper
multiple
times
on
the
subject
and
as
one
senior
senate
aide
told
nbc
news
has
been
aggressively
lobbying
fellow
senators
to
further
scrutinize
the
contract
a
rubio
spokesperson
told
nbc
news
that
the
senator
spoke
to
trump
and
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
about
the
contract
and
his
staff
has
worked
with
the
defense
department
on
the
issue
prior
to
its
announcement
of
a
review
of
note
billionaire
oracle
co-founder
larry
ellison
donated
millions
to
rubio's
presidential
campaign
an
amazon
spokesperson
called
the
claims
of
unfairness
meritless
and
a
desperate
attempt
to
distort
the
facts
pointing
to
the
federal
court
ruling
that
battle
might
pale
in
comparison
to
other
headwinds
the
company
may
face
depending
on
the
results
of
the
next
presidential
election
while
trump
has
repeatedly
taken
aim
at
the
company
because
of
bezos
ownership
of
the
post
other
contenders
like
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
who
has
also
been
critical
of
the
post
bezos
nexus
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
have
discussed
breaking
up
the
company
meanwhile
the
federal
trade
commission
and
department
of
justice
are
currently
investigating
amazon
for
possible
antitrust
violations
and
should
a
democrat
win
the
white
house
in
there's
likely
to
be
increased
scrutiny
over
the
rules
that
allow
amazon
to
avoid
paying
federal
income
taxes
look
when
you
are
the
biggest
retailer
on
the
planet
there's
going
to
be
some
overlap
on
the
government
stuff
and
it
also
puts
this
huge
bull's-eye
on
you
said
one
washington
insider
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
he
counts
blue
origin
bezos
space
exploration
company
among
his
clients
walmart's
probably
sitting
back
saying
oh
thank
god
because
it
used
to
be
everybody
trashed
walmart
while
amazon
is
often
grouped
in
with
fellow
tech
giants
like
facebook
and
google
in
terms
of
the
scrutiny
it
receives
matt
stoller
a
fellow
at
the
open
markets
institute
a
liberal
think
tank
that
has
long
urged
much
tougher
regulation
of
the
big
tech
companies
said
amazon
is
in
a
unique
position
to
influence
washington
now
you
have
the
richest
man
in
the
country
running
one
of
the
biggest
companies
in
the
country
owning
the
washington
post
and
bringing
massive
numbers
of
employees
to
d.c.
stoller
said
that's
really
breaking
down
a
wall
that
has
existed
since
the
founding
of
the
country
which
is
that
we
keep
our
business
centers
and
our
political
centers
separate
