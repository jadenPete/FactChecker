mayor
jorge
elorza
has
not
been
shy
about
bringing
his
baby
to
work
and
in
doing
so
has
ignited
a
debate
about
the
role
of
children
in
the
workplace
and
cast
a
spotlight
on
the
struggles
of
balancing
a
career
and
child
care
to
some
elorza's
workday
appearances
with
year-old
omar
set
an
example
for
how
to
juggle
jobs
and
parenting
at
a
time
when
many
people
are
working
long
hours
away
from
their
children
and
paying
skyrocketing
costs
for
day
care
his
detractors
say
elorza
is
using
the
child
as
a
prop
and
benefiting
from
a
double
standard
that
would
make
it
impossible
for
a
working
mother
to
do
what
the
mayor
is
doing
i
do
think
that
if
a
female
elected
official
was
doing
the
same
thing
the
amount
of
push
back
that
we
would
be
getting
would
be
huge

council

people
would
say
that
we're
not
capable
of
doing
both
jobs
elorza
is
not
the

brought
her
day-old

to
the
senate
floor
to
cast
a
vote
last
year
but
the
chamber
had
to
change
its
rules
to
allow
it
what's
new
in
elorza's
case
is
that
he
has
incorporated
child
care
into
his
job
in
a
way
rarely
seen
in
the
american
public
sphere
his
tenure
as
mayor
of
rhode
island's
largest
city
comes
amid
a
growing
movement
to
let
parents
bring
their
babies
to
work
as
an
alternative
to
leaving
infants
at
day
care
for
long
stretches
while
they're
still
nursing
at
least
employers
have
baby
programs
including
government
offices
in
more
than
half
a
dozen
states
such
as

washington
and
vermont
according
to

institute
which
helps

and
track
baby-friendly
policies
california
is
considering
a
similar
policy
for
state
workers
in
an
interview
with
the
associated
press
elorza
said
bringing
his
child
to
work
was
a
decision
that
he
and
his
wife
stephanie
gonzalez
made
after
assessing
their
busy
unpredictable
schedules
he
wants
time
with
his
son
and
he
says
the
cost
of
day
care
is
too
high
for
their
budget
he
and
gonzalez
a
law
student
were
floored
by
the
per
week
price
tag
for
a
day
care
they
toured
before
omar
was
born
we
can't
afford
that
said
the
mayor
whose
annual
salary
is
i
don't
see
how
most
families
in
our
city
can
afford
that
instead
they
do
what
many
parents
do
split
up
child
care
duties
and
lean
on
the
baby's
grandmother
to
help
out
the
mayor's
calendars
for
disclosed
to
the
ap
after
a
public
records
request
show
that
elorza
often
spent
his
wednesdays
out
of
the
office
dialing
in
to
meetings
or
on
skype
calls
with
department
heads
such
as
the
schools
superintendent
or
public
safety
commissioner
the
mayor
confirmed
he
had
been
home
with
the
baby
on
wednesdays
but
that
now
that
his
son
is
older
and
more
mobile
working
has
become
more
difficult
now
he
spends
one
morning
a
week
with
omar
before
handing
him
off
to
the
boy's
grandmother
the
decision
has
put
elorza
in
the
hot
seat
the
head
of
the
teachers
union
who
is
frequently
at
odds
with
the
mayor
went
after
him
on
twitter
pointing
out
that
teachers
don't
get
the
same
opportunity
critics
also
have
accused
the
mayor
of
being
unprofessional
and
sometimes
even
inappropriate
it
happened
when
elorza
testified
about
legislation
to
strengthen
the
right
to
an
abortion
while
holding
omar
in
his
lap
and
again
when
he
brought
omar
to
a
news
conference
about
a
shooting
and
the
boy
made
goo
goo
noises
and
a
fuss
as
the
public
safety
commissioner
spoke
elorza
brushes
off
criticism
that
he
can't
perform
his
mayoral
duties
and
care
for
a
child
as
ridiculous
during
a
meeting
with
the
governor
and
other
mayors
on
high-stakes
legislation
one
of
elorza's
senior
staffers
director
of
communications
emily
crowell
left
the
room
for
a
phone
call
then
ended
up
helping
care
for
the
baby
outside
crowell
told
the
ap
it
was
her
choice
and
that
she
has
never
been
asked
to
take
the
baby
elorza
acknowledged
his
staff
sometimes
cares
for
the
child
while
he
works
he
said
no
one
had
ever
lost
out
on
professional
opportunities
or
had
to
put
aside
work
obligations
to
do
so
he
said
some
staffers
have
become
like
extensions
of
my
family
as
workplaces
around
the
country
try
to
accommodate
working
parents
without
going
too
far
the
parenting
in
the
workplace
institute
suggests
that
babies
at
work
policies
end
at
six
months
of
age
around
the
time
when
babies
start
to
crawl
brad
harrington
who
leads
the
boston
college
center
for
work
and
family
and
studies
the
changing
role
of
fathers
said
co-workers
like
to
see
children
in
the
workplace
but
it
starts
to
wear
thin
if
it
becomes
an
everyday
event
harrington
said
fathers
are
often
praised
more
than
mothers
for
being
involved
parents
but
studies
have
shown
that
if
men
do
conspicuous
caregiving
such
as
saying
they
are
leaving
every
day
at
to
pick
up
a
child
they
are
marginalized
at
work
harrington
whose
center
works
with
fortune
companies
added
that
depending
on
co-workers
to
care
for
a
child
is
inappropriate
elorza
said
he
has
tried
to
support
working
parents
both
in
city
policy
and
in
his
own
office
he
has
put
in
place
a
program
that
offers
per
week
toward
summer
camps
for
providence
kids
and
says
he
allows
people
in
his
office
to
bring
in
a
child
in
a
pinch
it's
really
brought
home
how
difficult
it
is
to
raise
a
child
and
not
sacrifice
your
career
he
said
