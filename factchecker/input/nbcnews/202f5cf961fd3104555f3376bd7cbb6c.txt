share
this
they're
telling
us
there's
a
chance
why
the
debate
nonqualifiers
won't
quit
yet
why
the
longest
long
shots
of
the
still-bloated
democratic
presidential
field
say
they're
staying
in
the
fray
manchester
n.h.
bill
de
blasio
runs
american's
biggest
city
oversees
a
budget
bigger
than
ireland's
and
commands
a
police
force
larger
than
the
army
george
washington
needed
to
win
america's
independence
at
yorktown
but
right
now
all
the
mayor
of
new
york
city
needs
is
something
much
more
humble
and
so
far
elusive
a
measly
bump
in
the
polls
from
to
percent
look
i've
been
at
percent
like
times
he
said
while
waiting
backstage
for
his
turn
to
be
number
of
presidential
candidates
to
address
a
gathering
of
new
hampshire
democrats
last
weekend
this
is
what's
so
tantalizing
and
aggravating
about
this
just
go
up
one
more
percent
and
you're
in
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
full
coverage
and
alerts
about
the
debate
de
blasio
is
one
of
eight
candidates
in
the
democrats
bloated
presidential
field
who
have
been
more
or
less
left
for
dead
because
they
failed
to
qualify
for
thursday's
debate
after
falling
short
of
the
percent
polling
threshold
we
at
least
know
looking
at
that
stage
that
the
nominee
will
emerge
from
that
group
said
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
a
city
about
times
smaller
than
new
york
south
bend
indiana
who
did
make
the
stage
if
you
read
what
people
say
about
de
blasio
online
he
says
he
doesn't
you
might
wonder
if
he's
a
glutton
for
punishment
we're
all
humans
you're
going
to
feel
negativity
and
all
of
its
forms
he
said
but
like
a
gambler
convinced
their
luck
is
about
to
change
de
blasio
and
his
fellow
extra-long
shots
keep
showing
up
because
every
speech
is
another
pull
of
the
lever
every
interview
another
deal
of
the
cards
and
every
trip
to
an
early
state
another
chance
to
catch
the
moment
that
changes
everything
an
hour
from
now
one
of
those
special
moments
could
happen
de
blasio
said
i'm
not
meaning
that
to
be
like
believing
in
magic
i'm
just
saying
we
just
don't
know
so
the
way
you
maximize
the
chance
for
that
is
to
keep
staying
out
there
and
saying
what
you
believe
spoiler
alert
it
didn't
happen
but
hey
there's
another
candidate
cattle
call
next
week
and
there's
another
debate
coming
up
soon
that
he
still
maybe
has
a
shot
of
qualifying
for
he'll
reassess
by
oct
the
odds
are
clearly
against
me
he
conceded
but
the
odds
have
been
against
me
in
every
election
i've
been
in
and
i've
managed
to
prevail
of
course
one
man's
dream
is
another
man's
delusion
we
tend
to
make
movies
about
people
overcoming
the
odds
and
proving
the
naysayers
wrong
even
though
according
to
the
math
most
people
do
not
beat
the
odds
and
the
kinds
of
people
who
get
into
politics
and
especially
the
ones
who
think
they
should
be
in
charge
of
the
nuclear
arsenal
tend
to
think
the
movie
is
about
them
after
all
they've
all
already
hit
the
jackpot
by
making
it
the
upper
echelons
of
politics
or
business
despite
plenty
of
people
telling
them
they
were
crazy
along
the
way
still
most
will
end
up
as
background
characters
in
someone
else's
against-all-odds
story
of
this
election
and
voters
patience
for
the
dreams
may
be
wearing
thin
a
majority
of
democrats
say
the
candidates
on
stage
thursday
are
already
too
many
just
percent
want
more
according
to
a
new
politico
morning
consult
survey
so
how
do
you
keep
going
when
all
the
evidence
tells
you
to
stop
nbc
news
asked
these
candidates
just
what
gets
them
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
when
plenty
of
democrats
would
be
happy
if
they
stayed
there
turns
out
there
are
a
few
simple
rules
of
survival
tim
ryan
is
an
optimist
at
a
clinical
level
he
joked
over
beer
and
escargot
at
a
manchester
restaurant
packed
with
political
medium
wigs
such
as
jimmy
carter's
former
finance
guy
and
the
mayor
of
a
new
jersey
town
you
have
to
be
ryan
an
ohio
congressman
said
there
are
too
many
hurdles
there
are
too
many
tough
days
but
it's
a
choice
the
background
of
his
iphone
was
a
quote
from
joel
osteen
the
celebrity
televangelist
pastor
about
destiny
it
began
this
is
your
time
this
is
your
moment
he
was
missing
his
son's
football
game
to
be
here
which
clearly
pained
the
former
high
school
quarterback
who
went
into
every
game
convinced
he
would
win
and
is
now
convinced
he
has
the
best
chance
of
beating
president
donald
trump
the
polls
don't
necessarily
agree
so
why
keep
putting
himself
through
this
because
people
always
tell
you
why
not
to
do
something
ryan
said
there
are
always
a
million
reasons
why
not
to
do
something
but
i
would
much
rather
be
in
the
position
of
following
my
own
instincts
my
own
heart
even
if
didn't
work
out
as
opposed
to
listening
to
some
dumb
bastard
who
didn't
know
what
they
hell
they
were
talking
about
and
if
i
didn't
take
my
chance
wondering
what
could
have
been
aside
from
money
which
is
of
course
a
real
concern
the
other
major
limiting
factor
on
a
presidential
candidate's
ability
to
stay
in
the
race
when
things
aren't
going
well
is
his
or
her
ability
to
absorb
chernobyl-level
doses
of
public
humiliation
tom
steyer
the
billionaire
former
hedge
funder
who
has
pledged
to
spend
million
of
his
own
money
on
his
campaign
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
money
do
i
take
it
personally
steyer
paused
reflecting
on
the
online
mockery
of
his
campaign
no
i'm
doing
it
for
a
reason
i'm
not
wondering
about
whether
i'm
right
about
that
reason
i
think
it's
really
important
so
i'm
not
going
to
be
deterred
steyer
insists
this
is
fun
at
least
the
talking
to
voters
part
even
though
most
people
with
his
kind
of
wealth
would
rather
use
it
to
be
on
a
beach
in
fiji
sipping
a
mai
tai
than
getting
grilled
by
reporters
in
their
own
suite
at
a
doubletree
in
manchester
if
i
were
in
fiji
sipping
a
mai
tai
i
would
be
despondent
he
said
ok
so
maybe
he's
not
a
beach
guy
what
about
his
acre
cattle
ranch
on
the
beautiful
california
coast
there
is
nothing
to
do
there
except
work
seriously
there's
no
recreational
activities
he
said
he
ended
up
making
the
october
debate
stage
after
missing
it
in
september
so
his
non-fiji
vacation
will
have
to
wait
the
key
to
success
is
stay
off
twitter
and
be
with
voters
go
where
you're
loved
author
marianne
williamson
said
any
time
i
get
whiny
i
slap
myself
across
the
face
indeed
nearly
every
candidate
said
they
don't
read
their
own
press
clippings
and
they
can
all
recall
a
particular
voter
who
came
up
to
them
with
an
encouraging
message
and
finding
succor
in
that
interaction
for
days
or
weeks
to
come
still
williamson
acknowledged
she
has
to
fight
the
urge
to
respond
to
detractors
and
was
recently
outed
dming
the
author
erica
jong
to
complain
about
her
daughter
molly
jong-fast's
criticism
of
williamson
online
you
need
a
lot
of
emotional
and
psychological
discipline
to
run
for
office
williamson
said
there
are
days
you
wake
up
and
hope
not
to
see
your
picture
in
the
news
and
maybe
don't
watch
the
debate
supporters
of
hawaii
rep
tulsi
gabbard
held
signs
outside
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
convention
urging
attendees
to
seek
alternative
media
sept
the
day
of
the
debate
in
which
she
was
not
included
would
she
be
tuning
in
we're
still
working
that
out
gabbard
said
as
she
walked
away
running
for
president
is
hard
there
are
flight
delays
and
missed
family
time
the
pool
of
people
who
feel
comfortable
yelling
at
you
about
politics
has
expanded
from
just
constituents
to
the
entire
country
everyone
and
you
can't
please
everyone
if
you
want
to
feel
good
about
yourself

steve
bullock
as
he
looped
through
the
hallways
underneath
the
arena
stands
where
new
hampshire
democrats
stood
waving
opposing
candidates
signs
he
didn't
really
have
any
when
he
ended
up
on
the
same
flight
as
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
out
of
new
hampshire
later
that
night
even
american
airlines
seemed
to
understand
the
dynamics
of
the
race
placing
him
in

back

klobuchar
qualified
for
the
debate
on
thursday
while
bullock
did
not
what
keeps
me
grounded
or
reinvigorated
is
getting
like
that
hour
of
alone
time
to
go
running
said
bullock
who
has
run
marathons
he
was
late
to
a
big
iowa
candidate
event
in
june
because
he
had
run
the
governor's
cup
half-marathon
in
montana
earlier
that
day
he
came
in
rd
in
a
time
of
any
day
that
i'm
not
having
fun
it's
my
own
fault
right
he
said
like
i
don't
have
to
do
this
it's
just
the
future
of
representative
democracy
at
stake
if
the
media
won't
cover
your
stump
speeches
get
creative
ryan
dropped
a

endorsement
from

of
those
rare
losing
presidential
candidates
who
got
a
consolation
prize
of
helping
to
change
his
party's
direction
de
blasio
found
an
unlikely
ally
in
fox
news
host
tucker
carlson
when
he
appeared
on
carlson's
show
last
week
to
talk
about
his
robot
tax
two
days
after
carlson
called
him
the
worst
mayor
in
new
york
history
i
am
completely
with
you
on
that
one
right
there
carlson
said
it's
easier
now
than
when
it
happened
john
delaney
said
reflecting
on
being
booed
for
criticizing
medicare
for
all
at
the
california
democratic
convention
in
june
in
san
francisco
sure
delaney
a
former
congressman
from
maryland
would
love
to
be
the
nominee
but
as
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
and
his
much
larger
entourage
brushed
by
him
in
a
hallway
delaney
was
candid
about
how
he
sees
his
purpose
in
the
race
i
really
do
believe
when
i
stood
on
stage
in
san
francisco
and
said
medicare
for
all
is
a
bad
policy
and
bad
politics
and
i
was
booed
i
really
do
believe
that
started
to
change
the
debate
on
that
issue
and
i'm
happy
about
that
he
said
delaney
who
is
financing
his
own
campaign
said
he'll
say
in
through
at
least
the
iowa
caucuses
in
february
i
am
gratified
that
i
changed
the
debate
he
said
that
has
been
in
many
ways
a
very
positive
thing
for
me
personally
in
terms
of
my
headset
because
you
actually
start
seeing
tangible
results
at
least
in
some
areas
it
may
not
be
in
the
polls
he
added
