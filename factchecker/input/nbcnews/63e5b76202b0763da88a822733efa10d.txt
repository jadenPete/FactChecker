share
this
for
pelosi
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
was
the
easy
part
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
at
the
end
of
the
candidate
robert
redford's
character
asks
this
important
question
after
winning
an
election
in
that
movie
what
do
we
do
now
that's
the
same
question
now
facing
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
after
she
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
against
president
trump
over
this
ukraine-whistleblower-biden
story
who's
in
charge
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
pelosi
yesterday
said
she
was
formally
directing
the
house's
six
committees
that
have
jurisdiction
over
impeachment
oversight
and
other
related
matters
to
proceed
with
their
investigations
under
that
umbrella
per
nbc's
heidi
przybyla
and
adam
edelman
but
what
does
that
mean
who's
in
charge
house
judiciary
chair
nadler
house
intel
chair
adam
schiff
someone
else
what
are
the
actual
potential
charges
against
trump
we
know
this
all
stems
from
the
allegations
against
and
admissions
from
president
trump
that
he
discussed
joe
biden
and
his
son
on
a
call
with
ukraine's
president
and
that
he
had
withheld
aid
from
ukraine
but
what
are
the
potential
specific
charges
the
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
against
trump
as
nbc's
pete
williams
reminds
us
the
term
impeachment
is
commonly
used
to
mean
removing
someone
from
office
but
it
actually
refers
to
the
filing
of
formal
charges
more
from
williams
the
house
impeaches
the
senate
then
holds
a
trial
on
those
charges
to
decide
whether
the
officer
a
president
or
any
other
federal
official
should
be
removed
and
barred
from
holding
federal
office
in
the
future
what's
the
timetable
for
democrats
remember
the
iowa
caucuses
take
place
on
feb
the
day
after
the
super
bowl
for
an
nfl
season
that's
entering
week
when
do
house
democrats
want
to
wrap
this
up
because
the
clock
is
ticking
when
it
comes
to
the
presidential
election
so
we
get
the
similarities
between
this
ukraine-whistleblower-biden
story
and
the
russia
investigation
allegations
of
election
interference
dirt
on
the
political
opposition
charges
and
countercharges
but
here's
what's
different
but
maybe
most
importantly
this
is
potentially
a
much
easier
story
for
democrats
to
tell
as
the
new
york
times
carl
hulse
puts
it
his
refusal
so
far
to
provide
congress
with
an
intelligence
official's
whistle-blower
complaint
as
required
by
law
coupled
with
the
possibility
that
mr
trump
dangled
american
military
aid
as
a
bargaining
chip
to
win
investigation
of
a
political
rival
by
a
foreign
government
strikes
them
as
a
stark
case
of
presidential
wrongdoing
what's
also
different
about
this
ukraine
story
is
that
democrats
appear
to
be
getting
immediate
results
from
trump
after
they
made
it
clear
they
were
going
to
pursue
impeachment
president
donald
trump
said
tuesday
he
had
authorized
the
release
of
the
complete
fully
declassified
and
unredacted
transcript
of
a
july
phone
call
he
had
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
per
nbc
news
also
the
white
house
is
preparing
to
turn
over
the
whistleblower
complaint
by
this
thursday
according
to
a
senior
administration
official
it's
worth
asking
had
democrats
resisted
impeachment
again
would
they
be
getting
these
results
thirteen
that's
at
least
the
number
of
house
democrats
who
currently
represent
districts
that
trump
won
who
have
now
come
out
for
some
type
of
action
regarding
impeachment
according
to
an
nbc
news
count
of
the
have
formally
announced
their
support
for
the
move
just
this
week
first
came
elizabeth
warren's
lead
within
the
margin
of
error
in
the
des
moines
register
cnn
poll
then
came
her
slight
advantage
again
within
the
moe
in
monmouth's
new
hampshire
survey
and
now
quinnipiac's
national
poll
shows
her
ahead
albeit
within
the
margin
of
error
the
results
warren
percent
joe
biden
percent
bernie
sanders
percent
pete
buttigieg
percent
and
kamala
harris
percent
no
one
else
gets
more
than

however

was

about

some
like
one
student
from

ohio
attending

said
i'm
excited
to
see
the
impeachment
proceedings
begin
because
i
think
that
they're
important
in
protecting
our
national
security
and
continued
that
impeachment
could
be
an
opportunity
to
unite
people
others
cautioned
that
impeachment
would
be
a
back
burner
issue
a
woman
from
texas
attending
osu
said
i
think
that
had
they
wanted
to
impeach
president
trump
they
should
have
done
it
before
the
primaries
and
before
the
election
because
it'll
just
you

question
on
a
possible

saying
he
is
in

to
win
it

we

and
republican
establishment
