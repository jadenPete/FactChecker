doubts
about

most
progressive
policy
proposals
and
many
worry
joe

isn't
up
for
the
job
washington
as
democratic
candidates
compete
for
the
opportunity
to
take
on
president
donald
trump
the
incumbent
they
hope
to
oust
is
more
personally
disliked
than
any
of
his
recent
predecessors
and
half
of
voters
say
they're
very
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
of
his
re-election
but
the
electorate
at
large
also
expresses
doubts
about
some
of
the
progressive
policies
being
backed
by
candidates
like
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
and
the
party's
more
moderate
frontrunner
joe
biden
also
faces
questions
about
his
fitness
for
the
job
those
are
the
major
findings
in
the
latest
release
from
the
september
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
which
also
shows
that
percent
of
americans
give
trump
credit
for
what
they
call
an
improving
economy
the
highest
share
of
his
presidency
the
democrats
want
a
referendum
on
trump
the
gop
wants
a
comparative
choice
and
therein
lies
the
rub
said
democratic
pollster
peter
hart
who
conducted
this
survey
with
republican
pollster
bill
mcinturff
and
his
firm
public
opinion
strategies
the
poll
found
trump's
approval
rating
at
percent
among
registered
voters
virtually
unchanged
from
last
month
and
consistent
with
where
former
presidents
barack
obama
and
bill
clinton
stood
in
public
approval
at
this
point
in
their
presidencies
but
it
also
showed
that
trump
faces
historically
poor
personal
favorability
ratings
even
among
those
who
approve
of
the
plans
he
has
pursued
in
office
a

percent
of
registered

say
they
don't
like
trump
personally
regardless

their
feelings
about
his
policy
agenda
a
record
percent
say
they
dislike

his
policies
just
percent
say
they
like
trump
personally
with
percent
saying
they
also
approve
of
his
policy
agenda
and
percent
saying
they
disapprove
on
this
measure
the
high
degree
of
personal
dislike
for
trump
differentiates
him
from
his
five
most
recent
predecessors
majorities
of

said
they
personally
liked
obama
clinton
george
w.
bush
george

and
ronald
reagan
even
though
they
might
disagree
vigorously
with
their
political
agenda
in
fact
prior
to
trump's
presidency
the
highest
share
of

apiece
who
say
the

trump
also
continues
to
benefit
from
the
upside
of
the
polarization
of
the
electorate
around
him
commanding
more
enthusiasm
than
his
democratic

public
just
percent

support
the

cited
his

and
what
they

is
an
over-reliance
on
obama's
legacy
in
making
his
own
case
for
the
job
overall
i
like
joe
biden
a
lot
but
i
think
his
performance
at
the
debate
gave
me
the
feeling
that
he
might
be
a
little
bit
past
his
prime
for
the
position
said
one
male
democratic
respondent
from
new
york
a
white
female
democrat
from
illinois
put
it
more
bluntly
basically
he's
an
old
white
man
who
i
don't
think
is
going
to
help
our
country
advance
she
said
because
our
country
is
not
just
a
bunch
of
white
people
