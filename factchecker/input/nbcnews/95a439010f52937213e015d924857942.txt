could
break
on
impeachment
this
week
analysis
democrats
had
been
holding
back
as
they
ready
a
slew
of
charges
against
president
donald
trump
the
ukraine
affair
may
force
them
forward
impeachment
is
getting
a
jump-start
sure
some
intervention
divine
political
or
otherwise
could
still
stop
the
house
from
voting
on
the
political
equivalent
of
an
indictment
on
crimes
against
the
nation
but
house
democrats
have
been
pulling
together
a
wide-ranging
case
to
impeach
president
donald
trump
on
a
series
of
alleged
past
and
ongoing
crimes
against
the
country
a
set
of
charges
that
goes
far
beyond
the
mueller
report
and
all
signs
point
to
a
possible
public
inflection
point
later
this
week
when
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
testifies
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
the
dam
could
break
on
thursday
said
one
senior
house
democratic
aide
whose
boss
has
not
endorsed
impeachment
the
panel's
chairman
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
has
been
the
most
reluctant
of
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
top
lieutenants
to
move
toward
impeaching
the
president
but
democrats
say
schiff
is
spitting
hot
vinegar
over
maguire's
decision
at
the
insistence
of
the
justice
department
to
withhold
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower's
complaint
about
trump's
dealings
with
ukraine
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
said
democrats
should
move
forward
quickly
with
impeachment
if
maguire
doesn't
turn
over
the
complaint
that's
independent
grounds
to
file
articles
of
impeachment
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
with
nbc
news
monday
that
relates
to
this
ongoing
obstruction
and
stonewalling
cicilline
and
other
democrats
say
it
appears
that
trump
abused

power

for

and

over
the
summer
as
he
held

congressionally

aid

ukraine
trump
spoke
with
that
country's
new
president

about
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
hunter
whom
trump
has
accused
without
evidence
of
benefiting
from
corruption
in
ukraine
trump
has
acknowledged
that
much
he
appears
to
relish
bringing
biden's
name
into
the
mix
as
he
has
spoken
about
the
controversy
repeatedly
and
publicly
while
trying
to
gain
political
advantage
over
the
elder
biden
the
front-runner
for

democratic
presidential
nomination

has
his
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
who
has
been
an
emissary
to
ukraine
on
the
matter
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
trump
repeatedly
asked
zelensky
in
a
july
phone
call
to
open
an
investigation
into
hunter
biden
also
saying
citing
the
same
source
that
trump
did
not
offer
a
quid
pro
quo
in
the
conversation
if
it
is
shown
that
trump
held
back
aid
to
force
ukraine
to
go
after
the
younger
biden
impeachment
may
be
the
only
remedy
schiff
told
cnn
on
sunday
democrats
contend
that
the
trump
administration
is
illegally
obstructing
congress
work
by
blocking
schiff
from
access
to
the
whistleblower
complaint
which
if
it
didn't
involve
the
president
would
normally
be
shared
with
the
chairman
of
the
committee
if
maguire
doesn't
turn
it
over
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
told
her
colleagues
in
a
letter
over
the
weekend
the
impeachment
investigation
will
enter
a
whole
new
stage
trump
has
said
he
may
be
willing
to
release
a
transcript
of
his
call
but
democrats
are
insistent
that
they
want
the
complaint
which
could
include
more
information
than
the
substance
of
the
discussion
between
the
two
leaders
and
which
is
what
democrats
believe
schiff
is
entitled
to
see
under
the
law
if
anything
pelosi
is
still
holding
back
the
public
edge
of
a
process
that
has
been
moving
apace
behind
closed
doors
her
staff
was
scheduled
to
meet
monday
as
it
does
every
week
with
aides
to
the
six
committees
currently
involved
in
investigating
the
president
the
scope
of
the
impeachment
charges
under
consideration
by
democrats
is
breathtaking
according
to
those
familiar
with
the
discussions
russian
interference
in
the
election
and
the
trump
family's
efforts
to
hide
its
dealings
with
moscow
has
become
a
shrinking
piece
of
the
impeachment
puzzle
as
trump
has
taken
ever-bolder
actions
to
frustrate
the
basic
oversight
work
of
congress
in
its
investigation
into
that
matter
and
others
involving
the
president
democrats
are
also
gathering
evidence
for
possible
obstruction
of
justice
charges
stemming
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
including
the
eyewitness
testimony
the
judiciary
committee
received
from
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
last
week
lewandowski
testified
that
the
president
twice
directed
him
to
tell
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
un-recuse
himself
and
shut
down
mueller's
investigation
of
trump
the
other
buckets
of
potentially
impeachable
offenses
include
obstruction
of
congress
a
category
that
covers
a
laundry
list
of
efforts
by
trump
to
prevent
the
house
from
obtaining
testimony
and
documents
from
various
federal
officials
agencies
and
even
people
who
do
not
work
for
the
government
like
lewandowski
over
whom
trump
has
sought
to
limit
disclosures
by
asserting
executive
privilege
then
there
are
allegations
that
trump
has
used
his
office
to
enrich
himself
in
violation
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
which
prohibits
federal
officeholders
from
benefiting
financially
from
their
positions
democrats
say
the
president's
interactions
with
ukraine's
leader
and
the
administration's
push
to
conceal
them
from
congress
have
created
another
pot
of
potentially
impeachable
offenses
that
overlap
with
existing
abuse-of-power
and
obstruction
allegations
and
finally
there's
a
miscellaneous
category
that
involves
such
headings
as
the
president's
alleged
failure
to
defend
the
country
from
enemies
and
his
re-appropriation
of
congressionally
approved
funds
to
build
a
border
wall
it's
unlikely
that
all
of
those
counts
would
end
up
in
articles
of
impeachment
only
the
strongest
would
survive
and
they
could
be
sliced
and
diced
in
any
number
of
permutations
to
arrive
at
only
a
handful
of
actual
charges
but
the
universe
of
possibilities
is
large
and
it
has
expanded
considerably
in
just
the
last
couple
of
weeks
as
the
president
has
chosen
to
fight
congressional
investigators
rather
than
cooperate
with
them
for
trump
who
is
unlikely
to
be
removed
from
office
by
the
senate
under
any
circumstances
the
main
war
is
about
what
impeachment
means
for
his
re-election
chances
he
and
his
allies
are
pursuing
a
narrative
that
biden
used
his
influence
as
vice
president
to
shut
down
an
investigation
into
a
company
that
his
son
worked
for
and
that
hunter
biden
improperly
received
millions
of
dollars
even
though
that
probe
apparently
was
no
longer
active
at
the
time
in
an
op-ed
in
the
washington
post
lawyers
george
conway
and
neal
katyal
argued
that
the
ukraine
affair
is
more
demanding
of
trump's
impeachment
than
the
evidence
from
the
russia
probe
the
current
whistleblowing
allegations
however
are
even
worse
they
wrote
unlike
the
allegations
of
conspiracy
with
russia
before
the
election
these
concern
trump's
actions
as
president
not
as
a
private
citizen
and
his
exercise
of
presidential
powers
over
foreign
policy
with
ukraine
they
continued
moreover
with
russia
at
least
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
the
facts
through
the
mueller
investigation
here
the
white
house
is
trying
to
shut
down
the
entire
inquiry
from
the
start
depriving
not
just
the
american
people
but
even
congressional
intelligence
committees
of
necessary
information
for
house
democrats
the
question
of
impeachment
has
suddenly
become
more
pressing
said
an
aide
to
a
lawmaker
who
has
long
favored
moving
forward
on
impeachment
if
this
isn't
the
moment
then
what
is
