of

expect
from
a
crowded
fall
session
immediately
after
the
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
last
month
republicans
appeared
ready
to
take
action
and
craft
a
bipartisan
compromise
with
democrats
to
try
to
reduce
gun
violence
trump
himself
suggested
several
times
that
he
would
favor
stronger
background
checks
but
later
wavered
after
the
latest
shooting
in
odessa
texas
there
has
been
little
talk
of
potential
movement
in
the
negotiations
on
capitol
hill

still
slated
to
make
the
issue
a
priority

it
go
away
the
house
judiciary
committee

week
because
of
hurricane
dorian
on
several
democratic-sponsored
bills
to
prevent
gun
violence
one
would
ban
high-capacity
magazines
another
would
prevent
people
who
are
considered
a
risk
to
themselves
or
others
from
accessing
guns
and
still
another
would
prevent
individuals
who
are
convicted
of
misdemeanor
hate
crimes
from
owning
firearms

also
hold
a

last

that
the

if
the

is
in
favor
of
a
number
of
things

publicly
and
i
know
that
if
we
pass
it
it'll
become
law
i'll
put
it
on

floor
democrats
added
a
few
hot-button
items

careful
stance

not
changed
the
public
isn't
there
on

she
reiterated
to
house
democrats
during
a
conference
call
in
late
august
though
she
didn't
close
the
door
on
the
possibility
of
moving
forward
in
the
future
it's
your
voice
and
constituency
but
give
me
the
leverage
i
need
to
make
sure
that
we're
ready
and
it
is
as
strong
as
it
can
be
she
told
rank-and-file
members
if
and
when
we
act
people
will
know
he
gave
us
no
choice
if
he
cannot
respect
the
constitution
we'll
have
to
deal
with
that
nadler
has
acknowledged
that
his
committee
is
already
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
which
will
determine
whether
they
decide
to
recommend
the
filing
of
articles

nadler
issued
a
subpoena
to
acting
homeland
security
secretary
kevin

for
documents
related
to
trump's
alleged
attempts
to
offer
pardons
to
people
carrying
out
the
administration's
immigration
policies
he
said
that
the
move
was
part
of
his
panel's
impeachment
probe
as
the
committee
continues
its
investigation
into
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
it
is
imperative
that
we
are
able
to
obtain
information
about
ongoing
presidential
misconduct
and
abuses
of
power
nadler
said
in
a
statement
about
the
subpoena
and
as
part
of
the
committee's
wide-ranging
investigation
into
whether
to
recommend

campaign's
alleged
hush
money
payments
to
playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
and
adult-film
star
stormy
daniels
during
the
campaign
a
committee
aide
familiar
with
the
matter
told
nbc
news
democrats
are
also
investigating
what
they
say
are
the
president's
violations
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
by
accepting
and
encouraging
foreign
governments
to
pay
to
stay
at
trump
resort
properties
without
congressional
approval
the
house
oversight
and
judiciary
committees
sent
a
series
of
letters
last
week
requesting
documents
and
information
regarding
vice
president
mike
pence's
trip
last
week
to
the
trump
international
golf
links
and
hotel
in
doonbeg

pushing
the
trump
national
doral
miami
as
the
next
venue
to
host
the
g
summit
the
house
is
expected
to
consider
a
short-term
spending
bill
next
week
that
would
keep
the
government
funded
past
sept
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
said
in
a
letter
to
house
democrats
last
week
hoyer
said
that
the
house
has
done
its
work
by
sending
appropriations
bills
to
the
senate
that
would
cover
percent
of
government
funding
but
the
senate
has
failed
to
introduce
similar
spending
bills
as
we
wait
for
them
to
complete
their
work
so
that
we
can
begin
conference
negotiations
a
continuing
resolution
will
be
necessary
to
prevent
another
government
shutdown
like
the
one
we
experienced
earlier
this
year
which
harmed
thousands
of
american
families
hoyer
wrote
in
the
letter
in
previous
years
congress
has
extended
government
funding
into
december
placing
the
odds
of
a
shutdown
closer
to
the
holidays
trump
last
signed
a
spending
bill
into
law
in
mid-february
which
funded
the
government
through
september
that
followed
a
lengthy
government
shutdown
fight
this
year
over
the
president's
request
that
congress
fund
a
wall
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
but
democrats
rejected
his
demands
prompting
the
president
eventually
to
declare
a
national
emergency
on
the
border
the
administration
is
now
in
the
process
of
raiding
money
from
the
military
in
order
to
finance
the
wall's
construction
trump
and
many
key
congressional
republicans
have
been
calling
for
the
approval
of
the
united
states-mexico-canada
agreement
known
as
the
usmca
that
was
negotiated
between
the
three
countries
last
year
on
a
third
conference
call
with
house
democrats
during
the
august
recess
pelosi
reiterated
that
she
had
key
concerns
with
the
deal
because
of
labor
standards
prescription
drug
prices
environmental
protections
and
concrete
enforcement
mechanisms
house
ways
and
means
chairman
richard
neal
d-mass
said
during
the
call
that
there
is
good
momentum
for
a
deal
with
the
administration
and
republicans
on
the
renegotiated
trade
deal
he
said
that
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
has
been
receptive
to
proposals
to
address
some
of
the
democratic
caucus
concerns
and
that
the
ball
is
now
in
the
administration's
court
with
everything
else
on
congress's
plate
it
could
be
difficult
for
democrats
and
the
administration
to
ultimately
come
to
an
agreement
especially
with
the
presidential
race
heating
up
