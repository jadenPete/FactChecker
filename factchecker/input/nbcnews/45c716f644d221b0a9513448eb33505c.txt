share
this
what
was
going
on
between
biden
and
castro
on
health
care
the
candidates
were
largely
talking
past
each
other
castro
articulated
a
real
divide
but
biden
described
his
plan
largely
accurately
things
got
a
little
confusing
in
the
debate
when
former
housing
secretary
juli
n
castro
accused
former
vice
president
joe
biden
of
forgetting
what
he
had
said
earlier
on
health
care
an
exchange
that
drew
attention
for
perhaps
implying
an
attack
on
biden's
age
and
memory
the
clash
came
after
castro
criticized
biden's
health
care
plan
for
not
automatically
enrolling
all
uninsured
americans
in
a
medicare-like
plan
as
castro
says
his
plan
would
do
the
difference
between
what
i
support
and
what
you
support
vice
president
biden
is
that
you
require
them
to
opt
in
and
i
would
not
require
them
to
opt
in
they
would
automatically
be
enrolled
they
wouldn't
have
to
buy
in
castro
said
that's
a
big
difference
because
barack
obama's
vision
was
not
to
leave
million
people
uncovered
when
biden
protested
that
they
would
not
have
to
buy
in
castro
said
he
was
contradicting
an
earlier
claim
that
people
would
have
to
buy
in
to
medicare
biden
responded
i
said
if
they
can't
afford
it
two
issues
are
at
play
here
one
is
the
narrow
issue
of
what
biden
said
earlier
two
is
a
disagreement
between
the
two
on
health
care
policy

app
for
full
coverage
of
the
third
democratic
debate
to
parse
this
requires
an
understanding
about
the
difference
between
their
plans
castro
according
to
the
outline
published
on
his
website
would
enroll
newborns
and
people
who
lose
their
insurance
automatically
in
a
medicare-like
plan
as
a
default
biden's
proposal
is
a
little
different
according
to
his
campaign
people
who
qualify
for
medicaid
under
affordable
care
act
expansion
would
automatically
qualify
for
a
zero-premium
medicare-like
plan
as
opposed
to
people
at
higher
incomes
who
would
have
to
pay
at
least
some
premium
and
he
would
automatically
enroll
individuals
when
they
interact
with
certain
institutions
such
as
public
schools
or
other
programs
for
low-income
populations
such
as
snap
before
the
exchange
with
castro
biden
said
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
which
is
true
if
you
accept
his
plan's
definition
of
can't
afford
it
he
also
said
you
automatically
can
buy
into
this
if
you
lose
your
job
and
insurance
which
is
also
true
in
that
someone
who
lost
his
or
her
job
would
be
given
the
opportunity
to
buy
a
medicare-like
plan
with
government
help
although
would
not
be
enrolled
automatically
this
reference
to
two
situations
one
a
person
who
loses
their
job
and
two
a
person
who
can't
afford
insurance
created
a
mix-up
later
when
they
argued
over
both
issues
simultaneously
when
castro
referenced
million
residents
who
would
potentially
be
without
insurance
under
biden's
plan
biden
protested
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
castro
took
his
initial
answer
to
mean
biden
was
backtracking
but
biden
immediately
and
repeatedly
clarified
he
was
referring
to
people
at
low
incomes
who
would
get
their
plans
for
free
and
be
automatically
enrolled
if
they
made
use
of
anti-poverty
programs
castro
kept
challenging
him
on
the
supposed
contradiction
anyway
even
after
he
had
cleared
it
up
castro
was
also
making
a
separate
point
which
he
articulated
at
the
end
which
is
that
biden's
plan
would
not
automatically
enroll
everyone
in
a
medicare-like
plan
who
doesn't
have
insurance
leaving
some
people
uncovered
this
would
potentially
be
by
choice
though
not
just
by
oversight
some
americans
would
elect
not
to
pay
the
premium
for
a
medicare-like
plan
even
if
it
was
capped
at
percent
of
their
income
as
biden's
plan
would
do
biden's
campaign
estimates
percent
of
people
would
be
covered
it
automatically
enrolls
people
regardless
of
whether
they
choose
to
opt
in
or
not
castro
said
if
you
lose
your
job
for
instance
his
health
care
plan
would
not
automatically
enroll
you
you
would
have
to
opt
in
here
castro
was
correct
but
they
didn't
get
to
debate
it
further
people
who
lost
their
job
would
have
access
to
a
medicare-like
plan
under
biden's
approach
but
wouldn't
be
automatically
enrolled
unless
they
hit
those
other
qualifiers
in
his
proposal
but
biden
also
described
his
plan
throughout
their
exchange
largely
accurately
noting
it
was
free
and
enrollment
was
automatic
only
at
lower
incomes
however
the
main
issue
castro
was
raising
whether
biden's
plan
truly
covered
everyone
or
left
millions
without
insurance
was
not
just
about
automatic
enrollment
a
lot
of
it
has
to
do
with
biden's
decision
not
to
subsidize
care
for
undocumented
immigrants
in
his
plan
which
they
didn't
discuss
onstage
the
end
result
was
a
debate
where
two
candidates
with
some
differences
were
largely
talking
past
each
other
castro
articulated
a
real
divide
but
biden
also
described
his
plan
largely
accurately
and
did
not
appear
to
backtrack
on
his
earlier
answers
in
a
significant
way
