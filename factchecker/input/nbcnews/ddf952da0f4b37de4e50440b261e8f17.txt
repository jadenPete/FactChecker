former
vice
president
joe
biden
on
tuesday
said
president
donald
trump
and
his
administration
must
comply
with
congressional
investigations
or
face
impeachment
hearings
over
allegations
that
trump
sought
to
pressure
ukraine
to
investigate
biden's
family
the
allegations
center
around
phone
conversations
trump
had
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
in
which
the
president
reportedly
pressured
zelensky
to
probe
biden's
son
who
had
business
dealings
in
ukraine
in
a
tuesday
speech
biden
repeatedly
said
trump's
actions
were
not
the
conduct
of
an
american
president
and
said
they
amounted
to
an
abuse
of
power
that
violates
his
oath
of
office
and
strikes
at
the
sworn
responsibility
of
an
american
president
i
can
take
the
political
attacks
he
said
they'll
come
and
they'll
go
and
in
time
they'll
soon
be
forgotten
but
if
we
allow
a
president
to
get
away
with
shredding
the
united
states
constitution
that
will
last
forever
if
trump
and
his
administration
does
not
comply
with
congressional
probes
biden
said
it
will
leave
congress
with
no
choice
but
to
initiate
impeachment
saying
that
would
be
a
tragedy
but
a
tragedy
of
his
own
making
he
said
the
allegations
regarding
trump's
actions
toward
ukraine
rise
above
being
a
democratic
or
republican
political
issue
we
know
who
donald
trump
is
biden
said
now
we
need
to
show
the
world
who
we
are
later
on
tuesday
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
who
had
for
months
resisted
impeachment
calls
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
more
than
two
dozen
democrats
have
come
out
in
favor
of
impeachment
action
since
the
ukraine
reports
came
to
light
last
week
with
many
of
them
announcing
support
within
the
past
hours
at
least
house
democrats
over
three-fourths
of
the
caucus
now
support
some
sort
of
impeachment
action
against
the
president
biden
was
far
from
the
only
presidential
candidate
to
address
impeachment
on
tuesday
though
many
of
his
democratic
counterparts
simply
reasserted
their
calls
for
impeachment
that
stood
before
the
latest
ukraine
allegations
billionaire
presidential
candidate
tom
steyer
who
ran
a
pro-impeachment
advocacy
group
before
running
for
office
told
nbc
news
tuesday
of
trump
if
we
don't
hold
him
accountable
now
he
will
get
worse
asked
whether
he
thought
the
house
democrats
were
capable
of
presenting
a
compelling
case
against
trump
to
the
public
steyer
said
that's
a
challenge
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
president
that
this
justice
department
will
do
anything
they
can
inside
or
outside
the
law
to
protect
this
president
he
said
it
will
be
a
fight
other
candidates
have
long
called
on
the
house
to
begin
impeachment
hearings
mostly
based
on
the
findings
from
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
into
questions
about
obstruction
of
justice
and
collusion
with
russia's
interference
into
the
election
many
of
them
renewed
their
calls
over
the
weekend
in
iowa
where
most
were
gathered
for
the
state
party's
steak
fry
event
the
house
must
impeach
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
tweeted
tuesday
it
must
start

other

for
impeachment
now

already
supported

to
the
latest
allegations

it
was

as
well
as
former

beto
o'rourke
d-texas
and
rep
tim
ryan
d-ohio
have
all
reiterated
their
calls
for
the
house
to
act
while
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
has
also
said
he
supports
impeachment
he
tempered
that
call
with
skepticism
that
republicans
would
follow
through
with
removing
trump
from
office
i
support
the
house
in
taking
on
impeachment
proceedings
i
also
think
that
the
only
real
resolution
to
this
will
be
defeating
this
president
and
his
enablers
in
the
congressional
republican
caucuses
buttigieg
said
monday
several
of
the
remaining
holdouts
including
self-help
guru
marianne
williamson
former
maryland
congressman
john
delaney
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
came
out
in
support
of
an
inquiry
on
tuesday
i
have
decided
that
impeachment
is
the
only
responsible
way
that
we
as
citizens
can
take
a
stand
against
the
president's
egregious
overreach
and
careless
use
of
the
powers
of
the
presidency
williamson
said
in
a
statement
sen
michael
bennet
d-colo
called
for
more
investigations
into
the
president's
conduct
but
stopped
short
of
calling
for
impeachment
proceedings
to
begin
in
the
wake
of
the
ukrainian
allegations
rep
tulsi
gabbard
d-hawaii
who
has
not
supported
impeaching
trump
did
not
change
her
position
during
a
tuesday
appearance
on
fox
saying
impeachment
would
be
terribly
divisive
for
the
country
for
his
part
trump
has
denied
the
allegations
and
called
the
growing
push
for
impeachment
a
ridiculous
witch
hunt
i'm
leading
in
the
polls
the
only
way
they
can
stop
me
is
impeachment
he
said
tuesday
while
attending
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
earlier
on
tuesday
trump
announced
he
would
declassify
and
release
the
full
transcript
of
his
late
july
phone
call
with
zelensky
so
far
the
administration
has
refused
to
turn
over
his
complaint
to
congress
biden
finds
himself
at
the
center
of
the
president's
ukraine
ordeal
as
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
have
for
months
tried
to
get
ukraine
to
probe
the
bidens
an
effort
which
was
aided
by
the
state
department
the
push
centers
on
biden's
call
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
including
removing
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
shokin
was
investigating
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
then
included
biden's
son
but
as
bloomberg
news
reported
earlier
this
year
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
and
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
that
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
politifact
meanwhile
reported
that
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
