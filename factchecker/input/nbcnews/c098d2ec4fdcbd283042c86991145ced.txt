share
this
around
the
world
disruption
is
beating
out
stability
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
disruption
not
stability
has
become
the
new
norm
whether
here
in
the
united
states
or
across
the
world
think
about
it
trump
and
everything
he
represents
the
democratic
resistance
boris
johnson
and
brexit
the
rebel
conservative
party
members
who
forced
johnson
to
lose
a
key
vote
yesterday
the
hong
kong
protests
that
just
extracted
a
key
concession
from
the
government
the
trade
wars
if
you're
looking
for
an
example
of
stability
in
the
world
good
luck
what
we've
learned
the
last
three
years
since
the
election
and
original
brexit
vote
is
that
disruption
tactics
work
especially
for
political
parties
and
movements
that
appear
to
be
at
a
crossroads
what
we
don't
know
is
how
disruption
movements
end
do
voters
around
the
world
crave
for
stability
or
do
they
prefer
to
fight
disruption
with
more
disruption
that
in
fact
is
one
of
the
essential
debates
in
the
democratic
presidential
race
with
joe
biden
campaigning
on
stability
and
bernie
sanders
elizabeth
warren
calling
for
revolution
structural
change
that's
the
number
of
conservative
members
of
parliament
who
broke
from
prime
minister
boris
johnson
yesterday
to
back
the
first
stage
of
legislation
meant
to
stop
a
no
deal
brexit
the
defections
meant
that
johnson
lost
a
crucial
vote
to
which
could
force
him
to
seek
an
extension
to
brexit
from
the
european
union
beyond
an
oct
deadline
it's
now
increasingly
likely
that
the
government
will
call
a
snap
election
in
the
u.k.
in
october
speaking
of
disrupting
forces
walmart
yesterday
said
it
would
stop
selling
ammunition
used
for
military-style
weapons
and
it
asked
its
customers
not
to
openly
carry
firearms
in
its
stores
the
news
follows
mass
shootings
across
the
country
including
people
who
were
killed
last
month
in
a
walmart
and
the
surrounding
area
in
el
paso
texas
per
nbc
news
in
july
a
disgruntled
walmart
employee
in
mississippi
killed
two
colleagues
and
wounded
a
responding
officer
the
nra
fired
back
at
the
company
it
is
shameful
to
see
walmart
succumb
to
the
pressure
of
the
anti-gun
elites
lines
at
walmart
will
soon
be
replaced
by
lines
at
other
retailers
who
are
more
supportive
of
america's
fundamental
freedoms
the
truth
is
walmart's
actions
today
will
not
make
us
any
safer
rather
than
place
the
blame
on
the
criminal
walmart
has
chosen
to
victimize
law-abiding
americans
still
you
see
where
the
needle
is
moving
in
corporate
america
meanwhile
in
north
carolina
yesterday
a
panel
of
three
judges
threw
out
the
state's
legislative
district
maps
on
tuesday
ruling
that
the
maps
were
such
an
extreme
partisan
gerrymander
that
they
violated
the
state
constitution
nbc's
jane
timm
writes
and
new
maps
must
be
completed
in
two
weeks
the
judges
said
the
court
also
said
it
reserved
the
right
to
move
the
primary
election
if
needed
so
how
can
north
carolina
judges
rule
that
new
maps
for
the
state's
legislative
districts
are
an
unconstitutional
partisan
gerrymander
when
the
u.s.
supreme
court
said
in
june
that
it's
not
an
issue
the
federal
courts
can
resolve
the
answer
is
simple
from
yesterday's
ruling
per
nbc's
pete
williams
this
result
is
based
on
the
state
constitution
not
the
federal
one
buckle
up
political
world
ten
democratic
presidential
candidates
the
same
ones
who'll
be
participating
at
the
upcoming
debate
in
houston
will
speak
at
a
cnn
forum
on
climate
change
it
starts
at
pm
et
and
each
candidate
gets
minutes
so
the
forum
in
total
will
last
almost
seven
hours
and
ahead
of
the
forum
several
of
the
candidates
elizabeth
warren
kamala
harris
pete
buttigieg
and
julian
castro
released
their
climate
plans
given
all
of
these
plans
however
here's
our
question
which
of
the
candidates
will
make
climate
their
first
or
second
priority
plans
are
one
thing
priorities
are
another
ten
of
the
democrats
speak
at
a
cnn
forum
on

beginning
at
pm
et

and

booker
john
delaney
held
a
town
hall
yesterday
in
new
hampshire
where
he
tied
president
trump's
trade
war
with
china
to
the
fires
in
the
amazon
rainforest
nbc's
julia
jester
reports
delaney
argued
that
since
china
is
the
largest
buyer
of
soybeans
in
the
world
farmers
are
burning
trees
to
clear
cut
farmland
because
we're
engaged
in
this
trade
war
suddenly
farmers
around
the
world
believe
they
actually
have
an
opportunity
to
sell
soybeans
to
china
so
they're
burning
trees
to
do
this
so
in
a
way
this
terrible
event
is
tied
to
an
action
that
the
potus
is
taking
with
respect
to
our
trade
deficit
with
china
don't

trump
said
that
he
granted
a
disaster
declaration
at
the
request
of
thom
tillis
but
it
actually
came
from
the
state's
democratic
governor
newsy
looks
at
a
group
of
young
conservatives
who
are
trying
to
change
how
republicans
talk
about
climate
change
the
president
says
china
is
the
one
suffering
from
the
trade
war
but
data
