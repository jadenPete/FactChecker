donald
trump
blasted
beto
o'rourke
on
wednesday
morning
over
his
plan
to
buy
back
assault
weapons
saying
o'rourke's
pledge
during
last
week's
democratic
primary
debate
has
hampered
efforts
to
pass
gun-control
legislation
dummy
beto
made
it
much
harder
to
make

trump
wrote
convinced
many
that
dems
just
want
to
take
your
guns
away
will
continue
forward
during
thursday's
democratic
debate
o'rourke
said
hell

ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to

any
more
he
added
o'rourke's
call
for
mandatory
gun
buybacks
came
under
swift
criticism
from
conservatives
and
some
democrats
who
felt
it
was
counterproductive
to
passing
gun-control
measures
in
the
aftermath
of
three
mass
shootings
last
month
that
left
dozens
dead
i
frankly
think
that
that
clip
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
sen
chris
coons
d-del
told
cnn
last
week
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
told
fox
news
sunday
that
o'rourke's
message
doesn't
help
with
passing
legislation
and
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
also
a
presidential
candidate
said
yes
when
asked
if
the
remarks
played
into
republicans
hands
we
have
agreement
among
the
american
people
for
not
just
universal
background
checks
but
we
have
a
majority
in
favor
of
red-flag
laws
high-capacity
magazines
banning
the
new
sale
of
assault
weapons
buttigieg
said
this
is
a
golden
moment
to
finally
do
something
when
even
this
president
and
even
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hands
he
continued
let's
make
the
most
of
it
and
get
these
things
done
o'rourke
a
former
texas
congressman
who
is
polling
at
about
percent
in
the
realclearpolitics
polling
average
of
the
democratic
primary
field
responded
to
buttigieg's
remarks
criticizing
the
mayor
for
being
afraid
to
push
the
envelope
on
guns
leaving
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
because
trump
and
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
o'rourke
tweeted
that
calculation
and
fear
is
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
let's
have
the
courage
to
say
what
we
believe
and
fight
for
it
o'rourke
further
addressed
the
pushback
to
his
remarks
during
a
campaign
stop
in
texas
on
tuesday
donald
trump
and
mitch
mcconnell
pretending
to
be
interested
in
something
that
is
literally
a
life-or-death
issue
for
americans
that's
how
many
are
killed
every
year
through
gun
violence
is
simply
not
enough
o'rourke
said
we've
got
to
represent
the
urgency
the
big
ideas
the
boldness
of
people
that
we're
listening
to
here
today
in
plano
but
really
all
over
the
country
right
now
so
yes
i
hope
that
the
field
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
most
of
the
rest
of
this
country
has
reached
which
is
we
need
action
on
this
issue
and
we
need
it
urgently
i
just
don't
think
that
this
is
a
time
for
half
steps
or
half
measures
or
being
afraid
of
half
the
country
he
added
engage
with
everyone
republicans
gun
owners
nongun
owners
alike
but
come
up
with
a
solution
that
will
address
endemic
violence
that
has
taken
the
lives
of
more
than
of
our
fellow
americans
last
year
o'rourke's
campaign
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
from
nbc
news
trump's
tweet
comes
as
congress
remains
at
an
impasse
over
gun-control
legislation
in
part
because
the
president
has
not
yet
made
clear
what
he
would
be
willing
to
sign
on
wednesday
mcconnell
the
senate
majority
leader
reiterated
that
congress
was
in
a
holding
pattern
on
gun-control
measures
until
he
hears
what
trump
will
sign
i
know
i'm
the
majority
leader
but
i'm
telling
you
i
want
to
know
what
the
president
supports
mcconnell
told
reporters
it's
not
unimportant
to
my
members
and
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
what
he
thinks
would
make
some
progress
and
he
would
sign
trump
has
said
he
would
veto
a
house-passed
background-check
expansion
and
leading
democrats
said
mcconnell
and
trump
were
blocking
action
following
the
shootings
last
month
the
president
initially
said
he
might
support
measures
to
tighten
background
checks
on
gun
buyers
polls
including
one
last
month
by
nbc
news
and
the
wall
street
journal
have
shown
that
the
vast
majority
of
americans
support
such
checks
on
all
firearm
purchases
and
transfers
this
is
the
moment
for
the
president
to
do
something
different
and
courageous
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
said
schumer
and
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
said
sunday
that
any
gun-control
package
must
include
that
house-passed
background
check
bill
democratic
candidates
and
prominent
gun
safety
groups
have
been
mostly
unwilling
to
embrace
the
idea
of
mandatory
gun
buybacks
with
some
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
calling
for
making
any
buyback
programs
voluntary
other
democratic
candidates
have
sought
other
proposals
to
make
themselves
stand
out
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
has
called
for
a
threefold
and
fourfold
tax
increase
on
guns
and
ammunition
respectively
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
has
made
requiring
a
federal
license
to
buy
firearms
a
centerpiece
of
his
campaign
and
others
like
o'rourke
warren
and
buttigieg
have
adopted
similar
plans
