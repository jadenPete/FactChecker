a

progressive
democratic
congresswomen
of
color
known
as
the

who
have
been
frequent
targets
of
president
donald

and
his
supporters
know
that
this
wasn't
an
ad
for
young
conservatives
of

that
was
the
pretense
ocasio-cortez
continued
on

on
thursday
night
what
you

was
a
love
letter
to
the
gop's
white
supremacist
case
heng
responded
by
asking
in
a
tweet
are
you
really
calling
me
a
racist
aoc
i'm
calling
all
democrats
out
for
supporting
an
evil
ideology
heng
wrote
in
the
tweet
or
are
you
just
in
congress
to
hang
out
with
celebrities
and
tweet
out
ridiculous
ideas
like
the
green
new
deal
the
new
faces
pac's
website
says
its
goal
is
to
help
elevate
the
next
generation
of
republicans
so
that
we
can
not
only
survive
as
a
party
but
expand
beyond
the
boundaries
we've
set
for
ourselves
and
identify
the
new
faces
of
the
gop
who
will
lead
us
into
tomorrow
heng
says
in
her
bio
on
the
site
in
one
generation
i
saw
firsthand
the
power
of
the
american
dream
that's
why
i
am
going
to
continue
to
fight
for
freedom
of
speech
free-market
capitalism
and
the
founding
principles
of
our
country
that
has
allowed
families
like
mine
to
dream
bigger
and
achieve
more
than
we
ever
imagined
possible
