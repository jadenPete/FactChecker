for
months
resisted
efforts
to
launch
impeachment
proceedings
against
president
donald
trump
announced

would
benefit

politically

fact
of
the
president's
betrayal
of

pelosi
said
she
was
formally
directing
the
house's
six
committees
that
have
jurisdiction
over
impeachment
oversight
and
other
related
matters
to
proceed
with
their
investigations
under
that
umbrella
the
president
must
be
held
accountable
she
said
no
one
is
above
the
law
pelosi's
change
of
heart
comes
as
dozens
of
house
democrats
now
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
caucus
have
come
out
in
support
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
in
the
wake
of
reports
that
trump
may
have
withheld
aid
to
ukraine
to
pressure
officials
there
to
investigate
the
son
of
political
rival
joe
biden
the
impeachment
drive
follows
days
of
revelations
surrounding
trump's
apparent
push
to
have
the
ukrainian
government
investigate
the
former
vice
president's
son
hunter
biden
who
had
business
dealings
in
the
country
on
monday
the
washington
post
and
other
media
outlets
reported
that
trump
instructed
his
acting
chief
of
staff
to
place
a
hold
on
about
million
in
military
aid
for
ukraine
in
the
days
before
a
late
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
trump
responded
on
twitter
within
moments
of
pelosi's
announcement
calling
it
witch
hunt
garbage
they
never
even
saw
the
transcript
of
the
call
a
total
witch
hunt
he
wrote
earlier
trump
told
reporters
that
an
impeachment
inquiry
would
help
him
in
the
election
but
would
harm
the
country
if
she
does
that
they
all
say
that's
a
positive
for
me
in
the
election
you
could
also
say
who
needs
it
it's
bad
for
the
country
he
said
top
republicans
expressed
frustration
at
pelosi's
move
washington
democrats
have
been
searching
for
ways
to
reverse
their
election
defeat
since
before
president
trump
was
even
inaugurated
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
said
in
a
statement
the
result
has
been
a
two-and-a-half-year
impeachment
parade
in
search
of
a
rationale
when
investigations
by
special
counsel
mueller
and
the
senate
select
committee
on
intelligence
deflated
their
breathless
accusations
of
a
campaign
conspiracy
with
russia
democrats
have
simply
shifted
to
new
arguments
for
their
predetermined
conclusion
he
added
rep
doug
collins
r-ga
the
top
republican
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
said
on
twitter
that
pelosi's
announcement
changes
absolutely
nothing
merely
claiming
the
house
is
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
doesn't
make
it
so
until
the
full
house
votes
to
authorize
an
inquiry
nobody
is
conducting
a
formal
inquiry
he
said
later
in
brief
remarks
to
reporters
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
r-calif
criticized
democrats
for
investigating
this
president
even
before
he
got
elected
i
realize
did
not
turn
out
the
way
speaker
pelosi
wanted
he
said
as
of
tuesday
afternoon
more
than
democrats
supported
some
type
of
impeachment
action
more
than
three-quarters
of
the
member
caucus
an
op-ed
article
by
seven
freshman
house
democrats
in
the
washington
post
calling
for
impeachment
hearings
to
address
allegations
about
trump
and
ukraine
had
been
expected
to
give
pelosi
the
cover
she
needed
to
back
a
more
formal
impeachment
proceeding
against
the
president
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
nbc
news
on
monday
night
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
told
reporters
tuesday
afternoon
that
he
felt
pelosi
was
handling
the
situation
appropriately
the
late
july
discussion
between
trump
and
zelensky
has
been
scrutinized
following
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
media
reports
said
was
tied
to
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
the
white
house
is
preparing
to
turn
over
the
whistleblower
complaint
by
this
thursday
according
to
a
senior
administration
official
that
official
tells
nbc
news
the
complaint
will
undergo
a
classification
review
and
be
provided
to
congress
by
thursday
over
the
weekend
trump
admitted
he
discussed
biden
a
possible
challenger
with
zelensky
on
tuesday
he
said
he
would
release
the
transcript
of
the
call
and
confirmed
reports
that
his
administration
temporarily
froze
almost
million
in
aid
to
ukraine
but
he
gave
a
new
reason
for
doing
so
he
said
he
wanted
european
countries
to
contribute
money
too
and
did
not
want
the
united
states
to
do
so
alone
pelosi
for
her
part
said
tuesday
that
trump's
alleged
intervention
marked
actions
that
undermine
both
our
national
security
and
our
intelligence
our
protections
of
whistleblowers
trump
on
tuesday
denied
putting
any
pressure
on
the
ukrainian
leader
to
probe
a
political
rival
i
put
no
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
he
said
i
could
have
i
think
it
would
probably
possibly
have
been
ok
if
i
did
but
i
didn't
i
didn't
put
any
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
trump's
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
however
has
engaged
in
a
months-long
effort
to
have
ukraine
probe
the
bidens
an
effort
aided
by
the
state
department
that
effort
centers
on
biden's
calls
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
during
his
time
as
vice
president
that
included
a
call
to
remove
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
one
of
the
cases
that
shokin
was
investigating
involved
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
at
the
time
included
biden's
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
and
politifact
reported
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
