two
decades
how
to

adequate
government
oversight
of
the
industry
has
emerged

a
major
campaign
topic
among
democratic
contenders

advocates
and
democrats
have
accused
the
education
department
under
the
trump
administration
of
failing
to
clamp
down
on
student
loan
companies
and
for-profit
colleges
accused
of
preying
on
students
about
percent
of
student

is
owed
to
the

contracts
with

nbc
news
reported
monday
that
the
education
department
is
intervening
on
behalf
of
student
loan
servicers
some
accused
of
illegally
exploiting
borrowers
by
declining
to
turn
over
information
to
law
enforcement
agencies
in
multiple
states
investigating
the
businesses
the
department
has
argued
that
federal
oversight
supersedes
state
regulations
and
therefore
states
don't
have
the
ability
to
hold
loan
servicers
accountable
a
viewpoint
being
challenged
in
courts
nationwide
while
the
department
denied
having
a
blanket
policy
of
not
sharing
data
with
state
law
enforcement
agencies
it
said
that
data
is
released
on
a
case-by-case
if
information
is
being
requested
as
part
of
an
effort
to
regulate
a
student
loan
servicer
and
the
department
believes
that
regulation
is
pre-empted
by
federal
law
then
the
data
won't
be
released
a
department
spokesman
said
both
democrats
and
republicans
on
the
house
financial
services
committee
agreed
there
are
systemic
problems
within
the
student
loan
industry
and
house
financial

chair

d-calif
said
lawmakers
are
discussing
a
series
of
bills
including
creating
a
comprehensive
borrower
bill
of
rights
and
helping
borrowers
purchase
first
homes
waters
accused
the
trump
administration
of
undermining
the
protection
of
student
borrowers
with
the
appointment
last
month
of
a
new
student
loan
ombudsman
who
was
a
top
official
at
the
pennsylvania
higher
education
assistance
agency
a
federal
student
loan
servicer
that
has
been
the
target
of
consumer
lawsuits
and
state
investigations
in
lawsuits
against
student
loan
servicers
the
companies
have
been
accused
of
steering
struggling
borrowers
into
higher-cost
payment
plans
or
overusing
forbearance
which
allows
students
to
temporarily
postpone
repayment
while
still
being
charged
interest
the
committee's
ranking
member
rep
patrick
mchenry
r-n
c.
blamed
democratic
policies
that
have
nationalized
student
debt
lending
for
creating
a
problem
that
has
grown
to
more
than
trillion
worth
of
student
debt
this
is
a
crisis
but
a
crisis
that
congress
created
and
foisted
upon
a
generation
he
said
adding
that
laws
need
to
be
reexamined
but
that
student
lending
is
not
within
the
financial
services
committee's
jurisdiction
in
his
testimony
jason
delisle
a
resident
fellow
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
a
conservative
think
tank
agreed
that
the
policies
of
the
education
department
must
be
re-examined
and
that
the
department
and
congress
which
set
repayment
terms
for
loans
are
driving
the
problem
more
than
student
loan
servicers
if
student
debt
is
harming
people
it
means
higher
education
is
harming
people
that's
what
it
paid
for
delisle
said
other
republican
lawmakers
also
laid
the
blame
on
congress
i
know
everyone
wants
a
bogeyman
and
the
student
loan
servicers
are
a
convenient
bogeyman
but
guess
what
look
in
the
mirror
congress
congress
created
this
crisis
rep
andy
barr
r-ky
said
the
panel
of
consumer
advocates
however
told
the
committee
to
focus
on
stopping
predatory
lenders
in
the
market
crafting
a
borrower
bill
of
rights
seeking
more
accountability
from
for-profit
colleges
and
studying
the
disparities
that
the
debt
crisis
has
yielded
like
kerosene
on
a
fire
student
debt
is
driving
the
systemic
economic
and
racial
inequality
that
is
tearing
our
communities
apart
and
tearing
our
country
apart
said
seth
frotman
who
started
the
nonprofit
student
borrower
protection
center
to
advocate
for
students
after
resigning
last
summer
as
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau's
student
loan
ombudsman
regardless
of
where
your
presuppositions
of
blame
for
this
crisis
lie
we
should
all
agree
on
one
thing
if
you
are
taking
on
debt
to
chase
the
american
dream
you
should
not
be
ripped
off
in
the
process
frotman
added
