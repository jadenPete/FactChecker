david
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
some
national
security
council
officials
were
caught
off
guard
by
bolton's
firing
learning
about
it
only
when
it
flashed
on
tv
screens
reports
over
the
weekend
that
bolton
and
vice
president
mike
pence
disagreed
with
trump's
camp
david
plan
were
the
last
straw
for
bolton
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
on
monday
pence
tweeted
that
the
stories
were
fake
but
bolton
did
not
and
that
according
to
the
officials
upset
trump
one
person
familiar
with
the
breakdown
between
the
two
men
said
trump
didn't
want
bolton
attending
the
u.n.
general
assembly
in
new
york
with
him
later
this
month
asked
if
the
disagreement
over
the
taliban
talks
led
to
bolton's
dismissal
grisham
said
that
there
was
no
final
straw
there
were
several
issues
he
said
they
had
policy
disagreements
but
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
one
official
said
afghanistan
broke
open
the
bottom
of
the
bag
in
a
relationship
that
had
been
eroding
another
official
confirmed
that
sharp
disagreement
over
the
afghanistan
deal
was
the
final
issue
that
ruptured
the
relationship
bolton
known
as
a
fierce
infighter
had
few
loyal
allies
internally
he
had
clashed
with
many
senior
members
of
the
administration
at
times
including
pence
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
but
he
could
also
build
alliances
when
needed
he
worked
closely
with
pence
on
multiple
issues
including
efforts
to
replace
venezuelan
leader
nicol
s
maduro
and
aligned
with
pompeo
on
encouraging
a
hard-line
stance
on
china
said
a
former
administration
official
he
was
one
of
the
loudest
hawks
inside
the
west
wing
perpetually
skeptical
of
the
country's
adversaries
and
unafraid
of
the
prospect
of
military
conflict
few
others
in
the
upper
ranks
of
the
administration
were
as
deeply
versed
in
the
nuances
of
foreign
policy
a
void
that
pompeo
will
now
have
an
outsize
role
in
filling
particularly
when
it
comes
to
iran
china
and
venezuela
said
the
former
official
most
recently
the
two
had
sparred
over
trump's
desire
to
have
leaders
of
the
taliban
visit
camp
david
in
the
days
before
the
anniversary
of
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
to
finalize
peace
talks
the
idea
was
strongly
opposed
by
bolton
even
as
officials
at
the
state
department
argued
it
could
move
the
parties
closer
to
an
agreement
officials
said
bolton
had
been
deeply
skeptical
of
negotiations
with
the
taliban
u.s.
negotiators
have
been
working
under
the
president's
demand
that
a
drawdown
occur
before
november
when
he's
up
for
re-election
asked
if
he
had
been
startled
by
bolton's
quick
exit
pompeo
told
reporters
he
had
not
i'm
never
surprised
and
i
don't
mean
that
on
just
this
issue
he
said
bolton's
departure
could
pave
the
way
for
a
more
flexible
approach
by
the
trump
administration
on
north
korea
iran
venezuela
and
afghanistan
former
u.s.
officials
and
two
current
u.s.
officials
said
bolton
had
pushed
trump
to
take
a
harder
line
on
other
regimes
he
has
deemed
untrustworthy
trump
on
the
other
hand
campaigned
on
the
promise
to
get
the
u.s.
out
of
conflicts
while
bolton
had
previously
pushed
for
striking
iran
in
an
effort
at
regime
change
trump
has
indicated
he
would
like
to
sit
down
with
iranian
officials
and
that
regime
change
is
off
the
table
pompeo
confirmed
tuesday
that
the
president
is
likely
to
speak
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
when
the
u.n.
general
assembly
meets
in
new
york
the
president
has
made
it
very
clear
he's
prepared
to
meet
with
no
preconditions
said
pompeo
some
officials
in
the
administration
had
also
grown
frustrated
with
bolton's
stance
on
venezuela
in
which
he
pushed
for
the
imposition
of
harsh
sanctions
on
the
maduro
regime
and
opposed
renewing
a
waiver
to
allow
the
energy
company
chevron
to
keep
operating
in
the
country
when
asked
earlier
about
his
differences
with
bolton
trump
indicated
he
didn't
have
a
problem
with
his
national
security
adviser
giving
an
opinion
that
diverged
from
his
own
i
have
some
hawks
the
president
said
in
a
meet
the
press
interview
this
summer
yeah
john
bolton
is
absolutely
a
hawk
if
it
was
up
to
him
he'd
take
on
the
whole
world
at
one
time
ok
but
that
doesn't
matter
because
i
want
both
sides
bolton
has
had
his
fair
share
of
detractors
in
congress
many
of
those
critics
praised
his
departure
with
even
some
who
held
a
favorable
view
of
him
said
the
change
could
be
a
positive
one
i
like
john
bolton
i
think
he
sees
the
world
for
what
it
is
i've
always
had
a
similar
view
of
threats
that
we
face
said
graham
r-s
c.
but
the
personal
relationship
between
the
president
and
national
security
adviser
is
important
i
think
the
view
that
there's
some
public
discussions
about
bolton
being
on
the
other
side
of
meeting
with
the
taliban
probably
was
a
bridge
too
far
but
sen
mitt
romney
r-utah
said
bolton's
departure
was
a
huge
loss
for
the
country
his
view
was
not
always
the
same
as
everybody
else
in
the
room
that's
why
you
wanted
him
there
romney
told
reporters
the
fact
that
he
was
a
contrarian
from
time
to
time
is
an
asset
not
a
liability
this
is
the
third
national
security
adviser
that
trump
will
have
to
replace
his
first
michael
flynn
was
in
court
for
a
status
hearing
on
tuesday
before
his
sentencing
for
lying
to
u.s.
officials
flynn's
successor
army
lt
gen
h.r.
mcmaster
said
he
was
retiring
after
repeated
disagreements
with
trump
it
is
unclear
what
will
now
happen
with
the
team
of
foreign
policy
experts
bolton
had
built
over
more
than
a
year
a
state
of
affairs
adding
yet
more
instability
to
the
national
security
ranks
under
trump's
presidency
trump
named
bolton
the
former
u.s.
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
and
undersecretary
of
state
for
international
security
to
the
post
in
a
tweet
in
march
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
bolton
said
in
a
fox
news
interview
that
he
was
taken
off
guard
trump
said
tuesday
that
he
would
name
a
new
national
security
adviser
next
week
gidley
said
tuesday
afternoon
that
deputy
national
security
adviser
charlie
kupperman
would
replace
bolton
as
the
acting
national
security
adviser
among
