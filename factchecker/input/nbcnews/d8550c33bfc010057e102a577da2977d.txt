president
donald
trump
on
monday
attempted
to
distance
himself
from
fresh
controversies
involving
his
businesses
the
latest
in
a
longstanding
debate
about
whether
he
is
using
the
presidency
to
enhance
his
personal
wealth
trump
referred
to
both
vice
president
mike
pence's
recent
stay
at
the
president's
irish
golf
resort
and
a
report
that
air
force
crewmembers
stayed
at
the
president's
scottish
golf
club
i
know
nothing
about
an
air
force
plane
landing
at
an
airport
which
i
do
not
own
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
near
turnberry
resort
which
i
do
own
in
scotland
and
filling
up
with
fuel
with
the
crew
staying
overnight
at
turnberry
they
have
good
taste
he
tweeted
nothing
to
do
with
me
trump's
all-caps
concluding
remark
quickly
began
trending
on
twitter
minutes
later
he
sent
a
second
tweet
claiming
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
of
our
great
vp
mike
pence
to
stay
overnight
at
one
of
the
trump
owned
resorts
in
doonbeg
ireland
mike's
family
has
lived
in
doonbeg
for
many
years
and
he
thought
that
during
his
very
busy
european
visit
he
would
stop
and
see
his
family
both
incidents
have
brought
renewed
attention
in
congress
to
trump's
relationship
with
his
business
house
democrats
are
probing
both
the
pence
stay
and
the
air
force
sleepover
the
latter
of
which
they
claimed
the
white
house
was
stonewalling
the

committee
is
separately
investigating
whether
the

has
run
afoul
of
the
emoluments

said
in
a
statement
last
week
that
trump's
properties
are
a
cesspool
of
corruption
and
a
black
hole
for
taxpayers
money
the
first
incident
to
catch
attention
was
pence's
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
which
required
him
to
fly
across
ireland
for
official
meetings
in
dublin
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
on
tuesday
said
that
pence
chose
the
area
based
on
family
ties
and
trump
made
a
suggestion
that
pence
stay
at
the
resort
by
wednesday
pence's
team
said
in
a
statement
that
trump
did
not
direct
the
vice
president
to
stay
at
the
golf
club
and
the
decision
was
solely
made
by
pence's
office
later
that
day
trump
said
he
had
no
involvement
with
pence's
decision
to
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
telling
reporters
people
like
my
product
what
can
i
tell
you
i
don't
suggest
anything
trump
said
i

suggest
it
nor
did
i
with
the
attorney
general
i
never
spoke
to
the
attorney
general
about

general
william
barr
booked
a
holiday
party
at
trump
international
hotel
in
washington
in
december
i
have
a
lot
of
hotels
all
over
the
place
and
people
use
them
because
they're
the
best
trump
added
and
i
know
the
attorney
general
is
using
it
as
i
read
in
the
paper
to
this
day
i
haven't
spoken
to
him
about
it
but
he's
using
the
hotel
and
people
like
my
product

can
i
tell
you
can't
help
it
on
friday

on
a
previously
undisclosed

trump
turnberry
the
president
has
come
under
scrutiny
for
the
use
of
taxpayer
dollars
at
his
properties
as
president
trump
has
spent
roughly
days
at
trump
properties
according
to
an
nbc
news
count
ahead
of
his
inauguration
trump
chose
to
turn
control
of
his
company
over
to
his
two
adult
sons
and
a
senior
trump
organization
executive
rather
than
divest
from
his
large
portfolio
last
month
the
president
suggested
that
next
year's
g-
summit
should
be
hosted
at
his
miami
golf
resort
insisting
he
would
not
profit
off
such
a
venture
we've
reached
a
point
where
the
corruption
of
the
trump
presidency
pervades
all
facets
of
the
government
jordan
libowitz
communications
director
for
the
left-leaning
watchdog
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
in
washington
told
nbc
news
people
can
no
longer
ignore
it
it
seems
now
clear
that
he
is
using
the
presidency
for
his
own
personal
profits
there
is
a
reason
we
are
now
seeing
movement
on
a
congressional
impeachment
inquiry
