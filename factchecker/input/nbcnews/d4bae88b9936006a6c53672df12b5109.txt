the

iowa

conducted
by
des

pollster
ann

widely
considered

be
the

surged

sanders

the
data
in
this

seem
to
suggest
the

is
narrowing
but
my
sense
is
there's
still
opportunity
aplenty
selzer
told
the
register
the
leaders
aren't
all
that
strong
the
universe
is
not
locked
in

the
data
is
unquestionably
good
news
for
warren
who
is
now
both
the
