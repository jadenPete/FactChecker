share
this
here's
how
kavanaugh
denied
the
ramirez
allegations
under
oath
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
a
year
ago
the
new
yorker
reported
on
deborah
ramirez's
claim
that
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
when
they
were
students
at
yale
exposed
himself
to
her
at
a
drunken
party
and
thrust
his
penis
in
her
face
over
the
weekend
two
new
york
times
reporters
corroborated
ramirez's
claim
at
least
seven
people
including
ms
ramirez's
mother
heard
about
the
yale
incident
long
before
mr
kavanaugh
was
a
federal
judge
two
of
those
people
were
classmates
who
learned
of
it
just
days
after
the
party
occurred
suggesting
that
it
was
discussed
among
students
at
the
time
the
reporters
write
this
is
significant
due
to
the
denials
that
kavanaugh
made
under
oath
about
the
allegation
before
his
confirmation
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court
as
well
as
to
the
gop
insistence
that
there
was
no
corroboration
sen
john
kennedy
r-la
are
ms
ramirez's
allegations
about
you
true
kavanaugh
those
are
not
she
no
no
none
of
the
witnesses
in
the
room
support
that
the
if
that
that
had
happened
that
would
have
been
the
talk
of
campus
in
our
freshman
dorm
the
new
york
times
reported
that
as
recently
as
last
week
she
was
calling
other
classmates
seeking
to
well
i'm
not
going
to
characterize
it
but
calling
classmates
last
week
and
just
seemed
very
i'll
just
stop
there
but
that's
not
true
that's
not
true
sen
dianne
feinstein
d-calif
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
it
is
that
the
allegations
by
dr
ford
ms
ramirez
and
ms
swetnick
are
wrong
kavanaugh
yes
that
that
is
emphatically
what
i'm
saying
emphatically
the
swetnick
thing
is
a
joke
that
is
a
farce
more
kavanaugh
i'm
painfully
aware
for
my
family
and
me
to
read
about
this
breathless
reporting
sen
john
cornyn
r-texas
of
course
the
the
sexual
assault
that
dr
ford
claims
that
you've
denied
then
the
claims
of
ms
ramirez
that
not
even
the
new
york
times
would
report
because
it
couldn't
corroborate
it
the
two
new
york
times
reporters
also
uncovered
another
story
similar
to
ramirez's
that
kavanaugh
at
another
drunken
yale
party
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hands
of
another
female
student
according
to
fellow
classmate
max
stier
the
times
says
it
corroborated
the
story
with
others
but
the
female
student
in
question
says
she
doesn't
remember
the
episode
yet
nbc's
heidi
przbyla
and
leigh
ann
caldwell
confirm
that
the
fbi
was
notified
of
stier's
claim
during
the
kavanaugh
confirmation
process
on
sunday
after
the
reporting
kamala
harris
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
i
sat
through
those
hearings
brett
kavanaugh
lied
to
the
u.s.
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
she
tweeted
he
must
be
impeached
elizabeth
warren
joined
her
as
did
bernie
sanders
and
beto
o'rourke
but
other
dems
didn't
go
that
far
the
most
important
thing
to
do
first
is
to
get
the
documents
so
that
you
can
actually
look
at
them
to
make
a
decision
about
impeachment
amy
klobuchar
said
per
nbc's
priscilla
thompson
you
can't
make
that
decision
just
on
news
reports
you
have
to
actually
get
those
documents
and
here
was
michael
bennet
on
msnbc
yesterday
well
i
don't
think
he
should
have
been
on
the
court
in
the
first
place
i
voted
against
him
but
i
do
think
we
need
to
have
due
process
here
we
can't
give
up
on
that
and
we
know
that
there
are
number
of
people
that
were
not
interviewed
and
i
think
they
should
be
interviewed
the
senate
and
the
house
should
see
what
the
results
of
that
investigation
are
trump
responds
to
attack
on
saudi
oil
facilities
oil
prices
spiked
shortly
after
trading
began
monday
after
an
attack
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
saturday
that
knocked
out
more
than
five
percent
of
global
oil
supply
and
halted
output
of
more
than
half
of
saudi
arabia's
daily
exports
per
nbc
news
president
trump
responded
to
the
attack
in
a
series
of
tweets
based
on
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia
which
may
have
an
impact
on
oil
prices
i
have
authorized
the
release
of
oil
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
if
needed
in
a
to-be-determined
amount
he
said
and
saudi
arabia
oil
supply
was
attacked
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
on
meet
the
press
yesterday
beto
o'rourke
double-downed
on
his
claim
that
there
should
be
a
mandatory
buyback
for
weapons
like
ar-
s
especially
with
dem
and
gop
senators
saying
o'rourke's
position
doesn't
help
their
current
negotiations
i
think
this
just
shows
you
how
screwed
up
the
priorities
in
washington
dc
are
i
think
what's
truly
awful
is
a
month-old
baby
shot
in
the
face
with
an
ar-
as
happened
in
odessa
what's
truly
awful
is
people
killed
in
a
walmart
the
saturday
before
school
starts
that
next
monday
buying
their
school
supplies
innocent
of
any
crime
or
any
threat
to
this
country
he
said
on
cnn
pete
buttigieg
said
that
o'rourke's
call
was
playing
into
gop
hands
right
now
we
have
an
amazing
moment
on
our
hands
buttigieg
said
we
have
agreement
among
the
american
people
for
not
just
universal
background
checks
but
we
have
a
majority
in
favor
of
red
flag
laws
high-
capacity
magazines
banning
the
new
sale
of
assault
weapons
this
is
a
golden
moment
to
finally
do
something
because
we
have
been
arguing
about
this
for
as
long
as
i
have
been
alive
when
even
this
president
and
even
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hands
and
then
o'rourke
responded
to
buttigieg
on
twitter
leaving
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
because
trump
and
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
that
calculation
and
fear
is
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
let's
have
the
courage
to
say
what
we
believe
and
fight
for
it

joe

courted
latino
voters
in

historic
cuban
district
per
nbc's
marianna
sotomayor
where
voters
told
nbc
they
were
enthusiastic
but
not
necessarily
committed
to
biden
they
are
interested
in
him
given
his
experience
conservative
family
values
and
electability
but
many
cited
mayor
pete
buttigieg
as
a
second
choice
notably
the
most
enthusiastic
biden
supporters
were
registered
republicans
or
independents
who
voted
for
trump
amy
klobuchar
distanced
herself
from
beto
o'rourke's
viral
debate
moment
when
he
called
for
a
mandatory
buyback
of
assault
rifles
like
ar-
s
nbc's
priscilla
thompson
reports
in
iowa
klobuchar
said
she
doesn't
look
at
the
issue
politically
noting
none
of
that
would
even
matter
if
we
don't
have
an
assault
weapons
ban
the
senator
would
however
support
a
voluntary
buyback
program
that's
roughly
the
number
of

workers
who
went
on
strike
