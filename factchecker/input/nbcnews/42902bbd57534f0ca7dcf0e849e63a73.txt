it's

vice
president
mike
pence's
decision
to
spend
two
nights
at
president
donald
trump's
golf
resort
outside
doonbeg
ireland
this
week
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
country
from
the
official
meetings
in
dublin
has
renewed
debate
about
whether
trump
is
violating
the
constitution's
emoluments
clauses
when
the
federal
government
pays
to
use
his
hotels
pence
defended
the
back-and-forth
itinerary
by
pointing
out
he
had
previously
visited
family
in
doonbeg
and
stayed
at
the
resort
before
trump
was
elected
president
and
he
wanted
to
have
dinner
on
this
trip
with
his
family
at
a
pub
owned
by
a
cousin
he
also
said
it
was
necessary
to
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
to
accommodate
the
unique
footprint
that
comes
with
our
security
detail
and
other
personnel
and
he
called
the
decision
logical
ethics
watchdogs
and
democrats
however
decried
the
move
as
another
example
of
what
they
say
is
the
president's
penchant
for
personally
profiting
from
official
business
a
criticism
that
elicited
even
more
explanation
after
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
had
said
trump
had
suggested
pence
stay
at
the
club
which
brings
us
to
the
u.s.
constitution
there
are
two
emoluments
clauses
in
the
document
the
purpose
of
these
provisions
is
to
prevent
corrupt
influence
on
federal
officials
a
recurring
mission
of
the
framers
that's
evident
from
the
text
of
the
rest
of
the
constitution
for
example
the
two
specifically
identified
high
crimes
warranting
impeachment
are
not
crimes
of
violence
or
theft
but
of
corruption
the
foreign
emoluments
clause
provides
that
no
u.s.
official
shall
accept
any
present
emolument
office
or
title
from
any
foreign
state
the
domestic
emoluments
clause
says
the
president
shall
receive
compensation
for
his
services
but
not
any
other
emolument
from
the
united
states
or
any
state
emolument
is
an
outdated
word
largely
unknown
to
the
public
in
a
pre-trump
era
if
broadly
defined
it
could
mean
a
benefit
of
any
kind
paid
to
any
entity
related
to
the
president
from
which
he
profits
narrowly
defined
it
might
mean
only
the
compensation
received
for
personal
performance
of
services
as
an
employee
of
that
entity
the
definition
of
this
outmoded
word
ultimately
adopted
by
the
courts
will
be
critical
at
first
glance
this
pence
controversy
might
appear
to
be
a
foreign
emoluments
clause
issue
because
the
trump
hotel
is
in
ireland
but
the
fact
that
the
u.s.
government
is
paying
for
the
stay
makes
it
more
likely
a
domestic
emoluments
clause
issue
litigation
related
to
the
domestic
provision
is
pending
in
several
federal
courts
and
deals
with
similar
issues
among
these
is
whether
trump
international
hotel's
continuing
lease
with
the
general
services
administration
the
federal
government
violates
the
domestic
emoluments
clause
another
issue
is
whether
the
provision
is
implicated
when
a
state
e
g
maine
spends
money
at
the
hotel
and
also
when
the
substantial
tax
concessions
are
received
from
the
district
of
columbia
these
examples
are
closer
to
the
pence-doonbeg
situation
because
the
benefit
is
coming
from
state
and
federal
governments
and
not
foreign
powers
at
least
one
court
has
suggested
that
these
instances
are
receipts
of
emoluments
from
the
federal
and
state
governments
under
the
domestic
emoluments
clause
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
payment
by
the
federal
government
to
the
trump
hotel
in
ireland
is
the
same
as
the
trump
hotel
in
washington
receiving
emoluments
from
the
state
of
maine
this
is
where
the
definition
of
emolument
becomes
critical
a
broad
definition
could
be
a
problem
for
the
president
maine's
money
is
a
benefit
trump
owns
the
hotel
trump
receives
a
benefit
from
maine
and
the
domestic
emoluments
clause
is
violated
but
a
strict
definition
of
the
word
leads
to
a
different
conclusion
one
in
trump's
favor
because
trump
himself
was
not
bringing
up
room
service
or
turning
down
the
beds
in
ireland
the
president
himself
was
not
being
compensated
for
the
personal
performance
of
services
when
the
u.s.
government
paid
for
pence's
stay
in
ireland
