this
pelosi
gets
squeezed
on
impeachment
analysis
the
house
speaker
has
stood
up
to
pressure
from
all
sides
this
year
will
her
strategy
hold
now
that
it's
mounting
quickly
washington
the
impeachment
vise
is
closing
on
speaker
nancy
pelosi
as
it
gets
tighter
pelosi's
fortitude
and
the
strength
of
her
strategy
will
be
tested
after
a
string
of
house
democrats
endorsed
beginning
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
over
congress
august
recess
the
judiciary
committee
moved
last
week
to
bless
its
own
investigation
without
the
imprimatur
of
a
vote
on
the
house
floor
as
a
result
of
that
and
of
individual
political
messaging
needs
democrats
have
been
wildly
inconsistent
in
describing
whether
they
are
pursuing
impeachment
or
not
nonetheless
the
probe
will
ramp
up
with
a
hearing
featuring
trump
campaign
manager
cory
lewandowski
on
tuesday
at
the
same
time
trump's
justice
department
is
using
mixed
messages
coming
from
house
democrats
about
their
impeachment
intentions
as
part
of
the
case
against
giving
lawmakers
access
to
secret
grand
jury
testimony
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
probe
all
of
that
amounts
to
a
squeeze
on
the
strategy
devised
by
pelosi
the
california
democrat
charged
with
the
constitutional
role
of
leading
the
house
and
the
political
role
of
keeping
her
party's
majority
all
year
pelosi
has
been
trying
to
balance
between
her
political
base's
demand
to
move
against
a
president
it
sees
as
criminally
corrupt
and
her
priority
of
avoiding
a
series
of
impeachment-related
floor
votes
that
expose
her
party's
most
vulnerable
incumbents
to
anger
back
home
from
either
liberal
constituents
or
swing
voters
she
appears
to
have
landed
on
a
one-vote
strategy
let
judiciary
draft
articles
of
impeachment
and
then
conduct
just
one
house
floor
vote
or
series
of
votes
so
that
lawmakers
in
tough
districts
don't
have
to
walk
the
plank
over
and
over
again
there
are
some
of
our
members
who
are
ready
to
vote
to
impeach
and
remove
the
president
tomorrow
and
there
are
some
who
believe
that
we
should
not
impeach
him
because
it
will
be
a
failed
exercise
in
the
senate
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
the
chairman
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
said
in
an
interview
on
cbs's
face
the
nation
on
sunday
but
the
vast
majority
of
our
caucus
including
our
leadership
is
of
the
view
that
we
should
do
the
investigation
before
we
determine
whether
the
president
should
be
impeached
that's
the
category
that
i
fit
in
and
that's
the
work
that
we're
doing
pelosi's
approach
will
give
an
avenue
to
pro-impeachment
democrats
to
air
their
case
while
keeping
it
off
the
floor
and
out
of
the
minds
of
swing
voters
for
now
but
the
issue
is
sure
to
get
thornier
for
her
soon
in
part
because
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
contest
is
heating
up
while
the
topic
was
ignored
in
last
thursday's
candidate
debate
on
abc
news
billionaire
activist
tom
steyer
who
built
his
public
image
and
campaign
on
calling
for
trump's
ouster
has
qualified
for
an
oct
debate
in
the
columbus
ohio
area
tom
steyer
will
hit
the
presidential
debate
stage
two
years
after
he
first
began
running
impeachment
ads
said
rebecca
katz
a
veteran
democratic
strategist
and
former
congressional
aide
house
democrats
have
already
twisted
themselves
into
quite
the
incoherent
pickle
on
impeachment
and
steyer's
prominence
only
puts
them
more
on
the
defensive
but
pelosi
has
been
unmoved
by
political
pressure
on
her
left
flank
acting
as
a
bulwark
against
the
passions
of
partisans
and
the
various
political
and
legal
arguments
advanced
by
colleagues
who
favor
impeachment
former
rep
donna
edwards
d-md
wrote
in
the
washington
post
a
week
ago
that
trump's
actions
not
only
merit
impeachment
by
the
house
but
demand
it
if
lawmakers
don't
ask
she
argued
his
successors
will
be
unfettered
in
their
use
and
abuse
of
power
should
house
democrats
choose
not
to
act
on
this
laundry
list
of
obstruction
abuse
of
power
and
emoluments
violations
they
alone
bear
the
responsibility
of
forever
changing
the
lines
of
demarcation
for
future
presidents
edwards
wrote
it
really
is
that
simple
it
could
be
that
frustration
with
pelosi
among
democrats
inside
and
outside
congress
boils
over
and
she
is
forced
to
change
her
course
but
if
pelosi's
calculations
are
right
she
is
suffering
short-term
pain
in
service
of
a
plan
that
will
have
trump
replacing
her
between
the
jaws
of
the
impeachment
vise
in
due
time
