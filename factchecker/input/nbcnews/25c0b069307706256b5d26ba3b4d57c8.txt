legal
analysis
the
singling
out
of
joe
biden's
son
ultimately
could
compromise
the
president's
possible
defense
president
donald
trump
can
no
longer
avoid
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
his
actions
regarding
pressure
on
ukraine
on
thursday
speaker
nancy
pelosi
announced
she
will
allow
the
house
to
formally
investigate
reports
that
the
president
might
have
ordered
ukraine
military
aid
frozen
to
pressure
the
country's
government
to
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
who
had
business
dealings
in
the
country
trump's
defense
options
narrow
every
day
that
he
makes
damaging
admissions
but
the
president
might
still
avoid
criminality
if
his
intangible
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs
ultimately
is
considered
broad
enough
the
question
is
whether
that
defense
is
enough
to
avoid
impeachment
congress
holds
the
express
constitutional
authority
to
regulate
public
and
private
dealings
with
other
nations
in
its
war
and
foreign
commerce
powers
even
though
the
president's
power
to
act
in
foreign
affairs
isn't
really
articulated
in
the
constitution
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
the
president's
vast
share
of
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
relations
and
the
independent
authority
to
act
sometimes
without
congressional
authority
but
even
with
what
the
supreme
court
has
called
the
unique
responsibility
and
the
lead
role
for
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
does
the
president
have
the
power
to
withhold
foreign
aid
at
a
whim
sometimes
yes
he
might
congress
has
previously
passed
legislation
dealing
with
foreign
economic
assistance
some
legislation
purports
to
instruct
the
president
to
prevent
disbursements
to
foreign
nations
that
have
engaged
in
disapproved
conduct
examples
include
seizing
the
property
of
or
breaching
contracts
with
u.s.
citizens
one
law
prohibits
the
use
of
foreign
assistance
to
pay
for
abortions
of
course
there
are
possible
applications
of
federal
criminal
law
to
the
president's
alleged
conduct
such
as
the
extortion
or
bribery
statutes
or
even
the
campaign
finance
law
used
against
trump's
former
attorney
michael
cohen
but
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
essentially
recognized
the
president's
expansive
executive
power
as
overriding
what
might
be
criminal
if
any
other
citizen
took
the
same
action
it
also
reaffirmed
the
department
of
justice's
view
of
the
president's
immunity
while
in
office
all
reasonable
doubts
as
to
criminality
would
likely
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
executive
especially
given
that
the
justice
department's
policy
is
not
to
charge
cases
based
upon
probable
cause
but
rather
when
the
government
believes
it
can
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
so
then
if
this
conduct
is
not
a
crime
does
that
mean
it's
not
impeachable
no
impeachable
conduct
is
not
necessarily
criminal
conduct
some
academics
disagree
with
that
position
harvard
law
professor
alan
dershowitz
takes
the
view
that
the
constitution
requires
an
actual
crime
to
impeach
but
history
suggests
that
abuse
of
power
alone
will
suffice
for
an
article
of
impeachment
and
that
no
crime
is
required
there's
also
plenty
of
support
for
the
notion
that
corruption
of
the
electoral
process
is
an
impeachable
offense
even
if
it
is
not
a
crime
the
president's
possible
defense
emerges
from
foreign
affairs
history
he
could
claim
that
he
has
broad
authority
to
conduct
foreign
affairs
even
though
congress
has
enumerated
foreign
affairs
powers
the
constitution
is
silent
on
whether
he
can
withhold
foreign
aid
some
statute
somewhere
allows
him
to
withhold
foreign
aid
and
even
possibly
the
law
lets
him
condition
such
aid
on
another
country
doing
something
beneficial
for
the
united
states
such
as
and
especially
rooting
out
corruption
which
could
harm
the
u.s.
assume
for
the
moment
that
all
of
those
are
true
and
that
the
president
enjoys
the
broadest
possible
power
to
condition
foreign
aid
to
a
country
on
that
nation
prosecuting
crimes
that
harm
the
u.s.
even
so
the
president
still
has
a
problem
it's
the
singling
out
of
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden's
son
that
ultimately
could
compromise
this
defense
no
reasonable
impartial
observer
would
believe
that
any
investigation
into
the
former
vice
president's
son
would
represent
a
corruption
prosecution
that
trump
believed
affected
national
security
or
even
merited
mention
on
a
phone
call
with
a
head
of
state
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
it's
bribery
extortion
or
a
violation
of
campaign
finance
law
it
ultimately
looks
like
an
abuse
of
power
and
a
corruption
of
the
electoral
process
both
of
which
are
impeachable
events
that's
why
this
latest
controversy
might
not
pose
a
real
criminal
threat
to
the
president
but
it
really
could
pose
an
impeachment
threat
