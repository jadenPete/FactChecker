republicans
may
have
found
a
crafty
way
to
keep
democrats
down
in
texas
the
gop
changed
the
rule
for
third
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
and
that
could
have
a
big
impact
on
state
and
federal
races
keep
texas
red
republicans
may
have
a
new
law
for
that
age-
and
race-related
demographic
changes
as
well
as
a
statewide
blue-wave
fueled
by
opposition
to
president
donald
trump
threaten
to
put
numerous
state
and
federal
races
in
play
for
democrats
after
decades
of
republican
wins
but
under
a
rule
that
went
into
effect
this
month
the
threshold
for
third
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
texas
was
lowered
in
a
way
that
watchdog
groups
nonpartisan
experts
and
progressive
activists
all
say
is
designed
to
siphon
votes
from
democratic
candidates
and
boost
the
prospects
of
the
gop
in
contests
where
the
margin
of
victory
in
is
expected
to
be
razor-thin
this
is
part
of
a
very
clear
strategy
by
the
texas
gop
to
keep
the
demographic
changes
we're
seeing
in
texas
from
being
reflected
at
the
ballot
box
said
anthony
gutierrez
the
executive
director
of
the
texas
branch
of
the
government
watchdog
group
common
cause
this
is
one
of
the
ways
they
could
use
a
third-party
candidacy
to
knock
off
a
percentage
point
or
two
from
a
democrat
allowing
republicans
to
retain
power
for
a
bit
longer
than
maybe
they
otherwise
would
have
texas
house
bill
passed
along
party
lines
by
the
state's
republican-controlled
legislature
in
may
and
signed
into
law
by
republican
gov
greg
abbott
in
june
lowers
the
threshold
that
minor
political
parties
defined
in
the
law
as
parties
that
nominate
by
convention
as
opposed
to
by
primary
must
meet
to
have
their
candidates
appear
on
the
ballot
under
the
new
law
a
third
party's
candidates
can
qualify
to
appear
on
the
ballot
if
any
one
of
them
got
percent
of
the
vote
in
a
statewide
race
in
the
last
five
elections
previously
a
third
party's
candidates
earned
a
spot
on
the
ballot
if
any
one
of
them
won
percent
of
the
vote
in
any
of
the
most
recent
statewide
elections
the
law
also
requires
minor
parties
to
pay
a
filing
fee
to
ensure
their
candidate
actually
appears
on
the
ballot
or
collect
the
required
amount
of
signatures
under
existing
texas
ballot
access
laws
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
for
under
state
statute
the
number
of
signatures
would
be
more
than
the
equivalent
of
percent
of
the
total
votes
cast
in
the
last
governor's
race
previously
filing
fees
had
only
been
required
for
the
two
major
political
parties
republican
supporters
of
hb
say
it
bolsters
the
electoral
system
by
both
making
it
easier
for
smaller
parties
to
have
access
to
the
ballot
and
by
evening
the
playing
field
for
such
access
but
a
far
greater
number
of
critics
including
political
scientists
democratic
party
and
progressive
strategists
as
well
as
the
two
most
prominent
third
parties
in
texas
say
the
bill
is
designed
to
pull
votes
from
democratic
candidates
by
making
it
easier
for
green
party
candidates
who
are
more
likely
to
attract
disaffected
democratic
voters
to
appear
on
the
ballot
the
result
could
prove
to
make
a
defining
difference
in
a
handful
of
closely
watched
races
in
an
increasingly
purple
texas
including
its
u.s.
senate
race
where
sen
john
cornyn
is
up
for
re-election
a
number
of
state
house
races
and
possibly
even
the
presidential
race
although
green
party
presidential
candidate
jill
stein
won
percent
of
the
vote
in
and
only
percent
in
when
you
hear
about
republicans
trying
to
get
green
party
candidates
on
the
ballot
it
really
makes
you
wonder
what's
going
on
because
obviously
they're
not
aligned
today's
gop
is
not
engaged
at
all
with
issues
dear
to
the
green
party
said
paul
brace
a
political
science
professor
at
rice
university
in
houston
who
specializes
in
state
politics
and
the
reality
is
that
allowing
the
greens
on
the
ballot
helps
republicans
and
so
there's
good
reason
to
be
cynical
about
this
brace
and
several
other
experts
pointed
to
recent
returns
to
make
their
point
green
party
candidates
had
for
years
qualified
under
the
prior
ballot
access
rules
to
appear
on
the
ballot
in
texas
but
in
for
the
first
time
since
the
elections
in
the
state
the
party
failed
to
qualify
owing
to
the
fact
that
no
green
party
candidates
running
in
statewide
races
in
had
cleared
the
percent
threshold
without
any
candidates
on
the
ballot
in
none
would
have
been
allowed
to
appear
in
either
but
by
enacting
hb
republicans
have
thrown
the
green
party
a
lifeline
leading
experts
to
conclude
that
their
timing
was
squarely
intended
to
help
the
greens
and
themselves
it
would
be
one
hell
of
a
coincidence
if
that
weren't
the
case

republican
state

drew
springer
who
sponsored
the

told
nbc

that
the
measure
was
designed

even
the

and
that
the

as
it
was

the
two-party

too
much
the

around
the

said
springer
who
represents
a

rural
northern

of
the

glen
maxey
the
legislative
affairs
director
for
the
texas
democratic
party
said
the
bill
will
absolutely
hurt
his
party
the
talk
of
texas
being
a
battleground
state
has
really
come
to
the
forefront
in
the
public's
mind
recently
and
i
think
republicans
are
just
looking
for
something
anything
that
can
help
them
in
their
races
he
said
maxey
also
expressed
concern
that
conservative
groups
and
individuals
might
quietly
fund
the
new
filing
fees
that
green
party
candidates
will
be
required
to
pay
texas's
libertarian
party
which
for
decades
has
had
no
trouble
qualifying
for
the
ballot
at
the
higher
threshold
and
will
continue
qualifying
under
the
new
more
relaxed
rule
told
nbc

it
strongly
opposes
the
the
law
too
due
to
the
filing

component
even
the

alfred
molison
the
co-chair
of
the

told
nbc
news
that
it's
only
there
by
the
whim
and
caprice
of
the
powers
that
be
and
slammed
it
as
a
tool
by
one
major
political
party
whose
only
purpose
is
to
hurt
the
other
major
political
party
the
state's
green
and
libertarian
parties
even
teamed
up
to
sue
the
state
over
the
bill
alleging
that
it
violates
their
constitutional
rights
by
creating
severely
burdensome
requirements
on
minor
political
parties
libertarians
cite
the
filing
fee
while
greens
cite
the
signature
requirements
but
unless
the
suit
advances
the
law
seems
destined
to
remain
in
effect
likely
placing
an
added
onus
on
democrats
in
the
state
to
earn
every
vote
in
texas
in
the

each
major
party
will
need
every
