not

washington
russian
spies
in
the
u.s.
conducted
a
massive
operation
to
track
and
collect
encrypted
fbi
radio
traffic
but
there
is
no
evidence
they
ever
cracked
the
codes
and
obtained
the
contents
of
the
communications
two
former
senior
fbi
officials
tell
nbc
news
nonetheless
the
russian
intelligence
success
first
reported
by
yahoo
news
provided
vladimir
putin's
government
unprecedented
insights
into
the
activities
of
secret
fbi
surveillance
teams
tracking
russian
operatives
in
the
u.s.
the
former
officials
said
the
breach
occurred
sometime
around
and
was
well
understood
by
the
former
officials
said
much
of
the
message
traffic
the
russians
collected
was
processed
in
two
russian
diplomatic
facilities
that
the
obama
administration
closed
in
citing
russia's
interference
in
the
presidential
election
we
knew
that
they
were
on
to
us
in
terms
of
radio
traffic
one
former
senior
official
told
nbc
news
they
had
a
huge
effort
they
threw
at
it
but
we
never
saw
content
yahoo
news
cited
former
officials
who
said
the
russians
had
access
to
likely
the
actual
substance
of
fbi
communications
but
the
two
former
officials
told
nbc
news
they
did
not
believe
that
to
be
true
the
two
former
senior
officials
said
they
had
seen
nothing
to
suggest
russia
successfully
decoded
encrypted
u.s.
government
communications
rather
the
russians
were
able
to
detect
and
locate
secret
fbi
radio
transmissions
they
said
what
they
saw
was
traffic
around
certain
meetings
with
people
who
were
talking
to
them
one
former
official
said
in
some
cases
the
insights
the
russians
gleaned
from
the
location
and
movements
of
fbi
surveillance
teams
led
them
to
stop
meeting
with
sources
in
the
u.s.
the
former
official
said
the
former
official
added
that
the
fbi
and
cia
learned
of
the
russian
success
through
some
espionage
successes
of
their
own
which
he
declined
to
detail
the
russian
operation
came
at
a
time
when
the
u.s.
was
developing
its
own
capability
to
identify
covert
russian
communications
from
march
through
may
of
fbi
agents
in
new
york
were
able
to
detect
specialized
encrypted
communications
sent
from
the
laptop
of
a
russian
spy
anna
chapman
to
a
minivan
driven
by
a
russian
government
official
according
to
her
indictment
chapman
was
arrested
along
with
nine
other
russians
who
were
accused
of
acting
as
a
network
of
sleeper
agents
sent
to
live
in
the
u.s.
under
non-official
cover
they
were
deported
to
russia
in
a
spy
swap
it
was
long
known
that
the
russians
were
using
their
diplomatic
compounds
in
maryland
and
new
york
as
listening
posts
which
is
why
the
obama
administration
seized
them
in
december
officials
said
but
the
cia
and
fbi
also
learned
that
wives
of
russian
diplomats
were
working
in
the
facilities
to
process
fbi
radio
traffic
said
the
former
senior
official
who
had
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
news
of
the
russian
success
comes
after
revelations
that
the
cia's
method
of
communicating
with
its
informants
had
been
compromised
nbc
news
and
other
organizations
reported
in
that
a
secret
fbi
cia
task
force
investigating
the
case
of
an
american
cia
officer
spying
for
china
concluded
that
the
chinese
government
penetrated
the
cia's
method
of
clandestine
communication
with
its
spies
using
that
knowledge
to
arrest
and
execute
at
least
cia
informants
according
to
multiple
current
and
former
government
officials
yahoo
news
then
reported
in
november
that
iran
also
had
cracked
the
cia's
covert
communications
system
resulting
in
a
cascading
crisis
that
put
at
risk
foreigners
around
the
world
who
had
been
recruited
by
the
american
spy
agency
to
provide
information
both
of
these
matters
are
known
to
the
congressional
oversight
committees
officials
tell
nbc
news
but
since
they
are
classified
there
has
been
no
public
accountability
