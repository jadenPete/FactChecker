you
will

and
sooner
than
you
think
that's
the
upshot
of
the
climate
plans
coming
out
of
the
democratic
field
several
candidates
are
calling
for
phasing
out
sales
of
fossil
fuel-burning
vehicles
within
the
next
two
decades
and
would
encourage
the
shift

and

andrew
yang
said
at
a
cnn
climate
forum
he's
suggested
a
voluntary
buyback
program
for
fossil-fueled
cars
the
candidates
approaches
set
up
a
general
election
clash
with
president
donald
trump
who
has
mocked
electric
cars
and
taken
steps
to
deregulate
the
industry
to
allow
vehicles
to
pollute
more
even
as
automakers
increasingly
bank
on
a
battery-powered
future
with
or
without
his
support
the
democratic
proposals
reflect
the
party's
bolder
approach
in
animated
by
activism
around
the
green
new
deal
but
also
by
the
brutal
math
of
climate
change
getting
to
zero-emissions
around
the
world
by
which
the
united
nation's
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
says
is
necessary
to
limit
global
warming
to
a
degree
celsius
increase
in
temperature
degrees
fahrenheit
requires
moving
past
fossil-fuel
burning
vehicles
they
make
up
about
percent
of
all
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
united
states
when
we
look
at
the
pollution
reductions
we
need
transportation
is
the
largest
source
of
emissions
out
of
any
sector
of
the
u.s.
economy
don
anair
who
manages
research
on
clean
vehicles
at
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
told
nbc
news
it's
critical
to
tackling
climate
change
but
for
democrats
the
politics
of
mandating
the
trend
ahead
of
the
u.n.
panel's
recommended
schedule
could
be
tricky
as
republicans
look
to
portray
their
opponents
as
virtue-signaling
scolds
who
want
to
tell
voters
how
to
live
and
eat
opposition
to
enviro-friendly
paper
straws
has
already
become
a
rallying
cry
for
conservatives
in
the
trump
campaign
even
sells
plastic
ones
on
its
website
with
the
pitch
liberal
paper
straws
don't
work
but
straws
unlike
cars
are
mostly
irrelevant
to
stopping
climate
change
and
they're
not
ingrained
in
the
american
identity
in
a
way
that
slots
perfectly
into
a
culture
war
nobody
ever
said
the
perfect
country
and
western
song
has
to
have
a
straw
in
it
but
they
have
said
that
about
trucks
even
before
the
latest
democratic
proposals
trump
spent
months
deriding
electric
cars
as
part
of
a
broader
denunciation
of
the
green
new
deal
and
similar
efforts
they
want
you
to
have
one
car
instead
of
two
and
it
should
be
electric
ok
the
president
said
in
a
speech
to
the
conservative
political
action
conference
this
year
at
another
event
in
michigan
he
did
an
impression
of
a
husband
asking
his
wife
darling
where
do
i
get
a
charge
after
running
out
of
juice
on
the
road
in
theory
people
want
to
be
more
sustainable
republican
strategist
matt
gorman
told
nbc
news
when
you
get
into
practice
that's
when
the
rubber
meets
the
road
and
it
can
get
troublesome
very
quickly
public
polling
has
shown
the
green
new
deal
and
related
climate
proposals
are
relatively
popular
but
a
poll
by
the
left-leaning
think
tank
data
for
progress
in
march
also
found
that
requiring
new
cars
to
be
electric
by
was
the
least
popular
environmental
policy
they
tested
with
voters
opposing
it
by
point
margin
we
live
in
a
car-triarchy
the
think
tank's
founder
sean
mcelwee
told
nbc
news
this
has
been
pretty
consistent
in
the
polling
we've
done
democrats
have
one
big
advantage
however
the
industry
is
already
preparing
for
something
like
a
post-green
new
deal
world
while
electric
vehicles
made
up
just
over
percent
of
american
sales
in
with
tesla
dominating
the
market
major
automakers
are
planning
to
roll
out
an
array
of
electric
vehicles
in
the
coming
years
industry
analysts
see
a
potential
tipping
point
in
the
next
few
years
as
battery
technology
improves
and
allows
the
cost
of
new
electric
cars
to
drop
below
gas-powered
ones
general
motors
ceo
mary
barra
declared
last
year
that
the
company's
future
is
zero
emissions
an
announcement
that
drew
a
rebuke
from
trump
volkswagen
plans
to
launch
nearly
electric
car
models
over
the
next
decade
the
overall
automotive
sector
globally
is
progressively
moving
toward
electric
vehicles
scott
shepard
a
london-based
auto
industry
analyst
for
navigant
consulting
inc
said
the
main
triggers
for
that
are
regulatory
policies
to
mcelwee
this
creates
an
opportunity
for
democrats
a
progressive
white
house
might
spur
electric
vehicles
with
policy
but
it's
automakers
who
will
be
making
the
strongest
case
to
the
public
with
a
marketing
budget
that
dwarfs
political
spending
there
is
a
sort
of
sense
of
electric
vehicles
now
as
these
coastal-elite-type
things
mcelwee
said
that's
the
kind
of
thing
an
advertising
campaign
would
be
designed
to
solve
there
are
signs
this
is
starting
to
happen
as
companies
get
ready
to
unveil
more
electric
models
aimed
at
broader
markets
they're
pitching
customers
on
potential
upsides
like
no
more
gas
costs
easier
maintenance
and
more
responsive
handling
rather
than
depicting
the
vehicles
as
a
sacrifice
to
save
the
planet
ford
for
example
is
preparing
customers
for
a
pivot
with
a
campaign
to
counter
myths
about
new
electric
vehicles
like
its
upcoming
mustang-inspired
suv
it
recently
put
out
a
video
of
an
electric
prototype
version
of
its
iconic
f-
pickup
truck
hauling
more
than
million
pounds
of
freight
countering
the
image
of
electric
vehicles
as
an
urban
commuter
phenomenon
this
helps
explain
the
unusual
dynamic
of
the
trump
administration
trying
to
loosen
regulations
to
allow
cars
to
burn
more
gasoline
only
to
get
pushback
from
the
same
auto
companies
that
would
supposedly
benefit
from
the
change
trump
has
raged
on
twitter
about
the
move
recently
and
his
administration
has
launched
an
antitrust
inquiry
into
four
automakers
who
came
to
an
agreement
with
regulators
in
california
the
center
of
the
electric-vehicle
boom
on
stricter
mileage
standards
on
wednesday
trump
announced
his
administration
is
revoking
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
vehicle
emissions
standards
which
effectively
required
automakers
to
produce
zero-emissions
vehicles
a
widely
anticipated
move
that
came
as
the
administration
also
prepares
to
roll
back
the
strict
corporate
average
fuel
economy
standards
set
under
president
barack
obama
but
it's
not
just
american
regulatory
issues
that
car
companies
have
to
think
about
france
and
the
united
kingdom
are
planning
to
phase
out
sales
of
gas
and
diesel
vehicles
by
china
is
making
a
big
push
to
build
out
its
own
electric
car
industry
and
india's
government
is
aggressively
pursuing
a
transition
as
well
norway
wants
to
phase
out
fossil-fuel
vehicles
by
and
it's
making
rapid
progress
about
percent
of
new
car
sales
were
electric
in
march
getting
too
far
behind
the
times
could
mean
not
being
able
to
sell
cars
in
major
markets
around
the
world
there's
still
skepticism
about
how
quickly
electric
vehicles
could
replace
gas-powered
ones
in
america
brett
smith
a
director
at
the
center
for
automotive
research
said
he's
seen
predictions
in
the
past
of
a
hockey
stick
effect
where
customers
suddenly
flock
to
electric
vehicles
at
an
exponential
pace
it's
never
come
smith
said
but
this
is
the
first
time
where
i
see
the
automotive
industry
putting
unimaginable
amounts
of
money
into
it
the
transition
requires
convincing
customers
not
used
to
electric
vehicles
to
adopt
a
new
way
of
thinking
about
energy
one
in
which
they
mostly
keep
their
car
topped
off
with
a
charging
station
at
home
or
work
experts
also
say
a
psychological
roadblock
remains
for
people
worried
they
won't
be
able
to
find
a
charging
station
on
a
long
trip
or
will
be
stuck
for
a
long
time
waiting
for
batteries
to
recharge
especially
in
rural
areas
this
is
where
democratic
proposals
could
make
a
big
dent
in
the
timeline
for
adopting
electric
vehicles
virtually
all
the
front-runners
in
the
polls
including
candidates
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
have
not
proposed
a
firm
date
for
phasing
out
fossil-fueled
cars
have
plans
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
on
new
charging
infrastructure
for
electric
vehicles
expanding
tax
credits
for
purchases
of
the
vehicles
could
also
encourage
people
to
switch
the
economic
case
is
very
likely
to
tip
to
electric
vehicles
soon
said
anair
of
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
the
next
step
is
charging
support
and
what
state
and
federal
policies
can
put
into
the
market
in
the
end
the
ability
of
democrats
to
win
the
political
argument
over
electric
cars
might
come
down
to
whether
customers
like
the
product
with
paper
straws
it
was
a
case
where
people
abruptly
changed
to
it
and
it's
just
plainly
not
a
good
product
gorman
the
republican
strategist
said
with
cars
they
need
to
continue
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
as
seamless
as
possible
for
people
to
do
it
