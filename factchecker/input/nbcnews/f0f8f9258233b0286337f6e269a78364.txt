soon
as
this
week
the
president
said
he
was
working
with

washington
president
donald
trump
was
set
to
be
briefed
thursday
on
potential
gun
control
measures
and
may
make
a
decision
shortly
after
on
what
path
forward
he
will
get
behind
an
administration
official
said
trump
was
to
be
given
summaries
of
the
various
ideas
endorsed
by
members
of
congress
and
white
house
aides
but
he
won't
be
immersed
in
any
specific
legislative
language
the
official
said
the
president
who
spoke
thursday
with
senators
advocating
for
stricter
background
checks
said
after
that
meeting
that
he
was
working
with
them
to
come
up
with
something
that
is
acceptable
to
everybody
and
that
there
would
be
additional
meetings
wednesday
and
thursday
so
we're
looking
at
background
checks
and
we
are
looking
at
putting
everything
together
in
a
unified
way
so
that
we
can
have
something
that's
meaningful
at
the
same
time
the
president
said
following
a
minute
call
with
trump
and
his
staff
wednesday
sens
pat
toomey
r-pa
chris
murphy
d-conn
and
joe
manchin
d-w
va
said
they
were
told
to
expect
something
from
the
white
house
on
thursday
though
the
president
had
not
specifically
signaled
what
bills
he
was
likely
to
support
it
was
a
very
engaging
conversation
for
quite
a
period
of
time
and
everybody
was
able
to
have
their
back-and-forths
on
this
and
the
president
is
still
very
encouraging
manchin
said
i
believe
he
sincerely
wants
to
move
forward
and
do
something
we're
going
to
know
hopefully
by
tomorrow
if
there's
something
that
we
can
all
agree
on
and
once
we
agree
on
something
we're
going
to
hold
to
it
and
fight
for
it
so
we'll
see
what
happens
white
house
and
congressional
staffers
have
spent
the
past
month
trying
to
find
a
bill
or
package
of
bills
that
could
pass
the
senate
narrowing
down
what
could
gain
the
necessary
support
from
democrats
and
republicans
trump
who
has
appeared
to
waffle
on
how
far
he's
willing
to
go
in
support
of
gun
control
measures
has
yet
to
make
any
decision
on
substance
or
on
whether
to
back
a
package
of
bills
a
new
piece
of
legislation
or
an
existing
bill
the
official
said
republicans
in
congress
will
need
backing
from
trump
to
provide
them
cover
and
help
sell
any
bill
to
their
base
of
pro-second
amendment
voters
there
have
been
several
sticking
points
in
talks
vice
president
mike
pence
has
been
pushing
for
legislation
to
include
changes
to
the
death
penalty
that
would
speed
up
executions
of
people
convicted
of
mass
shootings
a
move
that
might
be
a
deal
breaker
for
many
democrats
there
is
also
a
partisan
divide
on
how
far
background
checks
should
be
expanded
the
white
house
has
been
looking
at
a
failed
bill
that
would
have
expanded
background
checks
to
sales
of
guns
online
and
at
gun
shows
but
did
not
go
as
far
as
a
measure
that
recently
passed
the
house
that
would
include
sales
between
private
individuals
democrats
are
pushing
for
the
house
bill
which
white
house
officials
have
said
trump
would
veto
among
the
other
measures
the
white
house
has
been
exploring
are
ways
to
help
states
implement
so-called
red
flag
laws
that
would
take
guns
away
from
people
deemed
a
potential
threat
and
a
bill
to
increase
penalties
for
those
who
buy
a
gun
for
someone
else
in
order
to
help
them
evade
background
checks
another
bill
would
notify
local
law
enforcement
officials
if
someone
fails
a
background
check
to
purchase
a
gun
the
white
house
has
been
looking
at
possible
mental
health
measures
but
a
legislative
solution
to
that
has
been
harder
to
find
it
has
ruled
out
supporting
any
bill
that
would
limit
sales
of
any
type
of
guns
and
ammunition
such
as
an
assault
weapons
ban
