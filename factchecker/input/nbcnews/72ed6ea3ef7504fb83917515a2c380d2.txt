share
this
air
force
reviews
all
layovers
after
crew
stayed
at
trump's
scotland
hotel
we
must
still
be
considerate
of
perceptions
of
not
being
good
stewards
of
taxpayer
funds
the
service's
top
spokesman
says
the
air
force
said
sunday
that
it
doesn't
appear
any
regulations
were
broken
when
a
military
crew
flying
from
alaska
to
kuwait
stopped
off
in
scotland
and
stayed
overnight
at
a
resort
owned
by
president
donald
trump
but
it
has
decided
to
investigate
all
such
sleepovers
anyway
it
said
because
of
a
possible
perception
that
it's
not
being
good
stewards
of
taxpayer
funds
the
stop
in
march
at
trump
turnberry
about
miles
southwest
of
glasgow
has
been
the
subject
of
an
ethics
investigation
by
the
house
oversight
and
government
reform
committee
for
weeks
but
it
wasn't
publicly
disclosed
until
politico
reported
the
trip
on
friday
in
a
letter
in
june
to
patrick
shanahan
who
was
acting
defense
secretary
at
the
time
committee
leaders
said
they
were
investigating
whether
trump
may
have
benefited
from
receipt
of
emoluments
in
violation
of
the
u.s.
constitution
in
a
statement
sunday
the
air
force's
chief
spokesman
brig
gen
ed
thomas
said
the
trip
was
booked
routinely
through
the
defense
travel
system
using
the
closest
available
and
least
expensive
accommodations
to
the
airfield
within
the
crews
allowable
hotel
rates
while
thomas
didn't
explain
why
the
joint
air
force-alaska
air
national
guard
flight
was
routed
through
scotland
to
get
to
kuwait
thomas
stressed
that
in
general
the
stopover
of
a
u.s.
air
force
c-
in
glasgow
scotland
is
not
unusual
we
have
found
nothing
that
falls
outside
the
guidelines
associated
with
selecting
stopover
airports
on
travel
routes
and
hotel
accommodations
for
crew
rest
he
said
still
thomas
acknowledged
that
appearances
matter
and
he
said
the
air
force's
in-house
travel
agency
air
mobility
command
was
reviewing
all
guidance
pertaining
to
selection
of
airports
and
lodging
accommodations
during
international
travels
we
understand
that
u.s.
service
members
lodging
at
higher-end
accommodations
even
if
within
government
rates
might
be
allowable
but
not
advisable
he
said
even
when
usaf
aircrews
follow
all
directives
and
guidance
we
must
still
be
considerate
of
perceptions
of
not
being
good
stewards
of
taxpayer
funds
that
might
be
created
through
the
appearance
of
aircrew
staying
at
such
locations
thomas
told
nbc
news
that
c-
s
have
increasingly
used
glasgow
prestwick
airport
as
a
stopover
location
since
because
it's
open
around
the
clock
while
other
military
stopover
locations
aren't
it
also
has
better
weather
and
is
less
crowded
than
comparable
scottish
airports
he
said
and
thomas
said
aircrews
regularly
stay
at
commercial
properties
when
military
billeting
is
unavailable
due
to
capacity
limits
on
this
mission
the
crew
seven
active-duty
air
force
personnel
and
alaska
guard
members
stayed
at
turnberry
on
its
way
to
kuwait
and
at
a
marriott
hotel
on
its
way
back
the
cost
for
both
hotels
was
below
the
air
force's
allowable
daily
rate
of
