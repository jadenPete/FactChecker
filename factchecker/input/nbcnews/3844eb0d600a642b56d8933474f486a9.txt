share
this
key
questions
about
the
trump
impeachment
inquiry
political
fallout
democrats
republicans
and
the
president
enter
uncharted
territory
as
the
race
heats
up
president
donald
trump
is
facing
allegations
that
he
tried
to
strong-arm
a
foreign
leader
into
launching
an
investigation
that
might
hurt
democratic
contender
joe
biden
in
response
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
tuesday
for
the
first
time
endorsed
impeachment
proceedings
she
joins
a
slew
of
swing
district
democrats
who'd
previously
stayed
away
from
the
subject
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
the
third
in
modern
history
now
looms
and
especially
if
democrats
end
up
rolling
this
inquiry
into
a
formal
impeachment
vote
so
do
questions
about
the
political
fallout
here
are
four
of
the
biggest
so
far
impeachment
has
not
been
popular
among
voters
in
polling
but
the
context
of
the
discussion
has
been
the
mueller
investigation
now
something
different
is
at
issue
the
president's
conduct
with
ukraine
this
raises
the
possibility
that
public
opinion
will
shift
the
immediate
place
to
look
is
among
democrats
a
recent
monmouth
university
poll
found
that
percent
of
them
didn't
think
trump
should
be
impeached
compared
to
only
percent
of
republicans
who
said
he
should
with
pelosi
now
leading
a
more
concerted
democratic
impeachment
drive
the
question
is
whether
previously
reluctant
democratic
voters
follow
along
if
they
do
overall
polling
on
the
question
of
impeachment
will
grow
tighter
than
it's
been
there's
also
the
question
of
whether
the
ukraine
story
will
resonate
outside
of
the
democratic
base
will
independent
voters
who
opposed
impeachment
percent
in
the
monmouth
poll
shift
in
a
significant
way
will
there
be
any
kind
of
movement
among
republicans
the
less
unpopular
impeachment
becomes
obviously
the
less
risk
democrats
will
face
of
stirring
a
backlash
and
if
the
ukraine
story
were
to
evolve
in
a
way
that
created
majority
support
for
impeachment
they
could
end
up
on
solid
political
ground
trump
is
not
a
particularly
popular
president
his
approval
rating
is
generally
in
the
high
s
to
the
mid-
s
it's
never
broken
percent
in
the
real
clear
politics
average
his
disapproval
number
is
often
over
percent
this
is
why
the
public's
aversion
to
impeachment
so
far
has
been
striking
in
monmouth's
poll
for
example
percent
of
voters
said
that
trump
shouldn't
be
re-elected
in
and
that
it's
time
for
someone
else
to
be
president
and
yet
only
percent
said
they
wanted
to
see
him
impeached
and
removed
from
office
now
it's
possible
this
reflects
a
sense
among
some
voters
that
impeachment
would
represent
overreach
and
that
the
question
of
trump's
fate
should
be
adjudicated
by
the
public
in
november
and
not
by
congress
before
then
this
is
a
variable
that
was
not
in
play
during
the
last
two
impeachment
drives
with
bill
clinton
and
richard
nixon
both
of
them
were
in
their
second
terms
free
from
facing
the
voters
again
if
polling
on
impeachment
does
not
budge
after
this
week's
developments
it
will
raise
the
possibility
that
voters
feel
strongly
that
the
final
decision
on
trump
should
be
theirs
democrats
if
they
still
went
ahead
with
impeachment
would
be
ignoring
this
at
their
own
peril
impeachment
in
the
house
requires
only
a
simple
majority
something
democrats
could
attain
without
a
single
republican
vote
but
conviction
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
would
require
a
two-thirds
supermajority
meaning
democrats
would
need
a
lot
of
gop
help
to
get
there
this
is
where
the
clinton
impeachment
fell
apart
in
republicans
had
the
votes
in
the
house
but
democrats
closed
ranks
around
the
president
and
prevented
a
conviction
in
the
senate
a
key
reason
democrats
stayed
in
line
sen
joe
lieberman
of
connecticut
then
a
widely
respected
voice
on
morality
in
public
life
lieberman
was
a
clinton
ally
and
when
clinton
admitted
that
he'd
lied
about
an
affair
with
monica
lewinsky
democrats
looked
to
lieberman
for
guidance
there
was
speculation
that
he
would
demand
the
president's
resignation
but
when
he
went
to
the
senate
floor
on
sept
he
stopped
short
of
that
decrying
clinton's
conduct
but
refusing
to
back
his
removal
from
office
lieberman's
decision
provided
cover
to
other
democrats
and
clinton
never
faced
a
stampede
of
defections
if
there's
a
republican
who
might
play
the
lieberman
role
now
it
could
be
sen
mitt
romney
of
utah
who
has
so
far
gone
further
than
other
republicans
in
expressing
concern
over
the
ukraine
story
whether
romney
would
ever
endorse
trump's
impeachment
is
unclear
it's
also
unclear
if
such
a
move
from
him
or
from
any
other
individual
republican
would
set
off
a
cascade
of
gop
impeachment
calls
republicans
in
washington
believe
trump
has
a
strong
grip
on
their
party's
base
and
have
demonstrated
repeatedly
that
they
view
crossing
him
as
akin
to
crossing
their
own
voters
impeachments
are
rare
in
history
and
are
supposed
to
be
seismic
political
events
trump
impeachment
hearings
to
say
nothing
of
a
full-fledged
senate
trial
will
attract
massive
public
attention
and
dominate
the
landscape
for
months
and
yet
it
seems
at
least
possible
that
no
minds
will
end
up
being
changed
after
all
the
trump
presidency
has
been
defined
by
swirling
controversy
and
chaos
but
for
all
of
the
tumult
his
job
approval
rating
has
been
remarkably
stable
in
many
ways
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
the
intense
polarization
of
this
era
if
a
monthslong
impeachment
saga
produced
party-line
votes
in
the
house
and
senate
and
a
president
who
is
neither
weakened
nor
strengthened
by
the
exercise
