trump
administration
rolls
back
obama-era
lightbulb
energy
regulations
environmental
groups
said
the
actions
will
raise
utility
bills
and
increase
the
amount
of
greenhouse
gases
emitted
by
power
plants
the
trump
administration
is
rolling
back
requirements
for
energy-efficient
lightbulbs
eliminating
an
environmentally
friendly
policy
that
was
put
in
place
by
the
two
previous
presidents
under
one
action
the
energy
department
will
repeal
a
regulation
enacted
under
president
barack
obama
set
to
take
effect
on
jan
requiring
an
expanded
number
of
lightbulbs
in
the
u.s.
to
be
in
compliance
with
stricter
energy
efficiency
standards
that
regulation
change
was
spun
off
of
a
law
signed
by
president
george
w.
bush
that
aimed
to
gradually
phase
out
energy
inefficient
bulbs
like
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
the
regulation
that's
being
eliminated
would
have
redefined
four
categories
of
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
so
that
they
would
be
subject
to
existing
energy
efficiency
rules
from
which
they
were
previously
exempt
it
would
have
applied
to
about
half
of
the
billion
lightbulbs
used
in
the
u.s.
experts
have
said
the
trump
administration
said
that
the
obama
rule
is
a
misreading
of
the
law
trump's
energy
department
also
nixed
new
energy
efficiency
standards
for
all
pear-shaped
lightbulbs
that
were
also
scheduled
to
go
into
effect
jan
the
administration's
decision
on
the
regulations
was
made
public
online
wednesday
environmental
groups
argue
that
ending
the
regulations
will
result
in
higher
utility
bills
for
americans
and
the
production
of
more
electricity
by
greenhouse-gas
emitting
power
plants
at
least
one
group
is
considering
challenging
the
trump
administration
in
court
we
will
explore
all
options
including
litigation
to
stop
this
completely
misguided
and
unlawful
action

horowitz
the
director

the
natural

defense
council's
center
for
energy
efficiency
standards
said
in
a
statement
today's
action
sets
the
united
states
up
to
become
the
world's
dumping
ground
for
the
inefficient
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
being
phased
out
around
the
world
the
rule
changes
first
proposed
in
february
are
just
the
latest
example
of
president
donald
trump
rolling
back
energy-
or
climate-related
policies
put
into
place
before
he
took
office
last
year
the
environmental
protection
agency
announced
it
was
rolling
back
restrictions
on
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
coal-fired
power
plants
a
cornerstone
of
obama's
landmark
clean
power
plan
in
august
the
administration
rolled
back
obama-era
fuel
economy
standards
meant
to
reduce
air
pollution
and
last
week
the
administration
proposed
cutting
regulations
on
methane
emissions

key
contributor
to
climate
change
