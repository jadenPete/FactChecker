over
subpoena

president
president
donald
trump
filed
a
lawsuit
thursday
against
manhattan
district
attorney
cyrus
vance
who
subpoenaed
trump's
accounting
firm
for
eight
years
of
trump's
personal
and
corporate
tax
returns
earlier
this
month
the
subpoena
stems
from
vance's
criminal
investigation
into
the
trump
organization
about
hush
money
payments
made
to
two
women
who
have
alleged
affairs
with
the
president
trump
has
strongly
denied
the
affairs
the
lawsuit
filed
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
names
vance
and
the
president's
tax
preparer
mazars
usa
as
defendants
it
argues
that
the
manhattan
district
attorney
should
not
receive
trump's
tax
returns
because
v
irtually
all
legal
commenters
agree
that
a
sitting
president
of
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
the
criminal
process
while
he
is
in
office
the
framers
of
our
constitution
understood
that
state
and
local
prosecutors
would
be
tempted
to
criminally
investigate
the
president
to
advance
their
own
careers
and
to
advance
their
political
agendas
the
lawsuit
adds
and
they
likewise
understood
that
having
to
defend
against
these
actions
would
distract
the
president
from
his
constitutional
duties
that
is
why
the
framers
eliminated
this
possibility
and
assigned
the
task
to
supermajorities
of
congress
acting
with
the
imprimatur
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
jay

the
president's

the
constitutionality
of

in
response
to
the
subpoenas
issued
by
the
new

county

we
have
filed
a

this
morning
in
federal
court
on
behalf
of
the
president
in
order
to
address
the
significant
constitutional
issues
at
stake
in
this
case
vance's
spokesman
danny
frost
said
in

to
the

we
have
received
the

and
will
respond
as

which
he
has
denied
in
addition
to
trump's
company
vance's
office
has
also
subpoenaed
the
publisher
of
the
national
enquirer
the
new

reported
the
publication
was
involved
in
negotiations
with
adult
daniels
whose
real
name
is
stephanie
giffords
and
paid
to
silence
mcdougal
according
to
federal
prosecutors
the
president's
former
personal
attorney
michael
cohen
admitted
in
august
of
last
year
to
making
an
illegal
payment
to
daniels
in
order
to
keep
her
quiet
in
the
days
ahead
of
the
election
cohen
is
currently
serving
a
three-year
prison
sentence
for
tax
evasion
bank
fraud
breaking
campaign
finance
laws
with
the
hush
money
payments
and
lying
to
congress
prior
to
his
congressional
testimony
earlier
this
year
cohen
released
copies
of
two
checks
with
the
president's
signature
which
he
said
was
used
to
reimburse
him
for
his
payment
to

has
previously
reported
that
cohen
was
cooperating
with
prosecutors
in
the
manhattan
district
attorney's
office
last
year
american
media
inc
the
enquirer's
parent
company
entered
into
a
nonprosecution
agreement
with
federal
prosecutors
and
admitted
that
it
worked
with
the
trump
campaign
to
buy
the
rights
to
the
women's
stories
in
order
to
silence
them
the
practice
known
in
the
industry
as
catch-and-kill
involves
paying
for
the
exclusive
rights
to
stories
with
the
intention
of
never
actually
publishing
them
at
his
sentencing
last
year
cohen
said
that
time
and
time
again
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
cover
up
trump's
dirty
deeds
trump
tweeted
after
the
sentencing
that
he
never
directed
michael
cohen
to
break
the
law
he
was
a
lawyer
and
he
is
supposed
to
know
the
law
it
is
called
advice
of
counsel
and
a
lawyer
has
great
liability
if
a
mistake
is
made
that
is
why
they
get
paid
