renew
questions
about

apparent
work
for
foreign
governments
democrats
want
to
know
whether
the
president's
personal
lawyer
is
registered
as
a
foreign
agent
as
focus
grows
on
giuliani's
role
in
ukraine
conversations
washington
leading
democratic
senators
are
renewing
their
calls
for
the
justice
department
to
review
whether
rudy
giuliani
is
complying
with
a
federal
law
requiring
him
to
disclose
his
work
on
behalf
of
foreign
governments
the
latest
sign
of
how
the
president's
personal
lawyer
is
becoming
a
major
focus
of
lawmakers
in
a
letter
to
the
justice
department's
national
security
division
the
senators
said
the
former
new
york
mayor's
effort
to
work
with
the
ukrainian
government
in
an
investigation
into
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
raises
serious
additional
questions
about
the
legality
of
his
work
as
a
foreign
agent
while
also
representing
and
working
on
behalf
of
the
president
regarding
official
u.s.
policy
the
letter
lists
four
publicly
reported
accounts
of
giuliani's
other
interactions
with
foreign
governments
including
attending
a
pro-russian
conference
in
armenia
in
october
a
meeting
with
the
king
of
bahrain
in
december
that
preceded
the
signing
of
a
security
consulting
contract
and
two
appearances
at
conferences
hosted
by
an
iranian
group
advocating
regime
change
mek
these
are
just
a
handful
of
new
and
continued
activities
by
mr
giuliani
which
appear
to
be
paid
by
foreign
entities
and
government
with
a
desire
to
influence
u.s.
policy
the
senators
wrote
like
any
other
american
mr
giuliani
has
legal
obligations
to
report
his
work
on
behalf
of
foreign
clients
and
the
department
of
justice
should
not
give
him
preferential
treatment
or
exempt
him
from
his
obligation
just
because
he
is
the
president's
personal
attorney
the
democratic
senators
who
sent
the
letter
were
dick
durbin
of
illinois
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
tom
udall
of
new
mexico
tammy
duckworth
of
illinois
sheldon
whitehouse
of
rhode
island
richard
blumenthal
of
connecticut
and
jeff
merkley
of
oregon
they
first
raised
concerns
about
whether
giuliani
was
in
compliance
with
the
foreign
agent
registration
act
or
fara
more
than
a
year
ago
but
say
they
received
no
response
to
their
requests
separately
wednesday
sen
jeanne
shaheen
d-n
h.
a
member
of
the
foreign
relations
committee
called
for
giuliani
to
testify
before
the
panel
under
oath
about
his
interactions
with
ukrainian
officials
and
whether
he
was
acting
as
he
told
fox
news
tuesday
night
at
the
request
of
the
state
department
first-time
filings
related
to
fara
have
spiked
in
recent
years
since
high-profile
trump
associates
including
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
and
former
trump
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
faced
charges
stemming
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
probe
related
to
alleged
fara
violations
