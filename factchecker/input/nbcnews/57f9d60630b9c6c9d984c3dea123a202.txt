we
linsey
the

are
very
basic

have
been

by

them
right
there
indicating
how

time
they

candidates
who
interrupt
will
be
subject
to
having
their
time
reduced
later
on
but
this
is
democracy
the
great
american
experiment
and
the
candidates
are
here
tonight
to
make
their
case
stephanopoulos
the
podium
placement
was
based
on
their
current
standings
in
nationally
recognized
polls
with
the
leading
candidates
in
the
center
all
candidates
have
been
told
they
can
have
one
minute
to
make
an
opening
statement
and
we're
going
to
begin
in
reverse
polling
order
with
secretary
julian
castro
applause
castro
good
evening
y
bienvenidos
a
texas
welcome
to
texas
applause
it's
great
to
be
here
at
tsu
home
of
the
tigers
you
know
on
january
at
p
m
we're
going
to
have
a
democratic
president
a
democratic
house
and
a
democratic
senate
applause
there
will
be
life
after
donald
trump
but
the
truth
is
that
our
problems
didn't
start
just
with
donald
trump
and
we
won't
solve
them
by
embracing
old
ideas
we
need
a
bold
vision
universal
pre-k
and
universal
health
care
unleashing
millions
of
new
jobs
in
the
clean
energy
economy
a
tax
system
that
rewards
people
who
have
to
work
for
a
living
but
first
we
have
to
win
and
that
means
exciting
a
young
diverse
coalition
of
americans
who
are
ready
for
a
bold
future
that's
what
kennedy
did
it's
what
carter
did
it's
what
clinton
did
it's
what
barack
obama
did
and
it's
what
i
can
do
in
this
race
get
back
michigan
wisconsin
and
pennsylvania
florida
georgia
and
arizona
and
finally
turn
texas
blue
and
say
goodbye
to
donald
trump
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
klobuchar
klobuchar
good
evening
texas
southern
i
believe
that
what
unites
us
up
here
the
of
us
is
much
stronger
than
what
divides
us
and
i
think
that's
true
of
our
country
too
now
i
may
not
be
the
loudest
person
up
here
but
i
think
we've
already
got
that
in
the
white
house
applause
houston
we
have
a
problem
this
we
have
a
guy
there
that
is
literally
running
our
country
like
a
game
show
he
would
rather
lie
than
lead
i
think
we
need
something
different
i
am
someone
that
tells
the
truth
i
don't
make
promises
that
i
can't
keep
i
have
people's
back
and
i
believe
that
to
win
you
bring
people
with
you
and
that
is
how
you
govern
as
well
so
you're
going
to
hear
a
lot
of
ideas
up
here
some
will
be
great
but
if
you
see
that
some
of
them
seem
a
little
off-track
i've
got
a
better
way
if
you
feel
stuck
in
the
middle
of
the
extremes
in
our
politics
and
you
are
tired
of
the
noise
and
the
nonsense
you've
got
a
home
with
me
because
i
don't
want
to
be
the
president
for
half
of
america
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
all
of
america
applause
stephanopoulos
congressman
beto
o'rourke
o'rourke
it's
an
honor
to
be
on
this
debate
stage
it
is
wonderful
to
be
back
in
texas
in
houston
back
here
at
tsu
on
august
rd
in
el
paso
texas
two
things
became
crystal
clear
for
me
and
i
think
produced
a
turning
point
for
this
country
the
first
is
just
how
dangerous
donald
trump
is
the
cost
and
the
consequence
of
his
presidency
a
racism
and
violence
that
had
long
been
a
part
of
america
was
welcomed
out
into
the
open
and
directed
to
my
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
where
people
were
killed
dozens
more
grievously
injured
by
a
man
carrying
a
weapon
he
should
never
have
been
able
to
buy
in
the
first
place
inspired
to
kill
by
our
president
the
second
is
how
insufficient
our
politics
is
to
meet
the
threat
that
we
have
right
now
the
bitterness
the
pettiness
the
smallness
of
the
moment
the
incentives
to
attack
one
another
and
try
to
make
differences
without
distinctions
mountains
out
of
mole
hills
we
have
to
be
bigger
we
have
to
see
clearly
we
have
to
speak
honestly
and
we
have
to
act
decisively
that's
what
i
want
to
do
for
you
as
president
of
the
united
states
thank
you
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
cory
booker
booker
it
was
over
years
ago
that
i
was
a
law
student
and
moved
to
inner
city
newark
new
jersey
to
serve
as
a
tenants
rights
lawyer
to
try
to
address
the
challenges
in
my
community
and
i
was
sobered
by
them
the
gun
violence
the
sub-standard
housing
but
it
was
my
greatest
mentor
a
woman
named
ms
virginia
jones
who
challenged
me
she
said
boy
if
all
you
see
in
this
neighborhood
is
problems
that's
all
there's
ever
going
to
be
but
if
you're
stubborn
and
defiant
and
can
put
forth
a
vision
that
can
unify
people
then
we
can
make
transformative
change
she
was
a
church
woman
that
said
without
vision
the
people
will
perish
well
that's
exactly
what
we
did
we
created
extraordinary
unity
in
our
community
and
we
did
things
that
other
people
think
thought
was
impossible
that's
the
story
of
america
at
our
best
we
unify
we
find
common
cause
and
common
purpose
the
differences
amongst
us
democrats
on
the
stage
are
not
as
great
as
the
urgency
for
us
to
unite
as
a
party
not
just
to
beat
donald
trump
but
to
unite
america
in
common
cause
and
common
purpose
that's
why
i'm
running
for
president
and
that's
how
i
will
lead
this
nation
applause
stephanopoulos
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
yang
in
america
today
everything
revolves
around
the
almighty
dollar
our
schools
our
hospitals
our
media
even
our
government
it's
why
we
don't
trust
our
institutions
anymore
we
have
to
get
our
country
working
for
us
again
instead
of
the
other
way
around
we
have
to
see
ourselves
as
the
owners
and
shareholders
of
this
democracy
rather
than
inputs
into
a
giant
machine
applause
when
you
donate
money
to
a
presidential
campaign
what
happens
the
politician
spends
the
money
on
tv
ads
and
consultants
and
you
hope
it
works
out
it's
time
to
trust
ourselves
more
than
our
politicians
that's
why
i'm
going
to
do
something
unprecedented
tonight
my
campaign
will
now
give
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
for
an
entire
year
to
american
families
someone
watching
this
at
home
right
now
if
you
believe
that
you
can
solve
your
own
problems
better
than
any
politician
go
to
yang
com
and
tell
us
how
a
month
will
help
you
do
just
that
this
is
how
we
will
get
our
country
working
for
us
again
the
american
people
applause
stephanopoulos
mayor
pete
buttigieg
buttigieg
it's
original
i'll
give
you
that
the
american
people
are
divided
and
doubtful
at
the
very
moment
we
need
to
rise
to
some
of
the
greatest
challenges
we've
ever
seen
as
a
mayor
of
an
industrial
city
coming
back
from
the
brink
as
a
veteran
of
the
war
in
afghanistan
i
know
what's
at
stake
in
our
national
leadership
we
keep
sending
politicians
to
washington
asking
them
to
fight
for
us
but
then
when
they
get
there
they
seem
more
interested
in
the
part
about
fighting
than
the
part
about
us
good
politics
is
supposed
to
be
not
about
the
day-to-day
fights
of
the
politicians
but
about
the
day-to-day
lives
of
americans
we
just
marked
the
anniversary
of
all
day
today
i've
been
thinking
about
september
th
the
way
it
felt
when
for
a
moment
we
came
together
as
a
country
imagine
if
we
had
been
able
to
sustain
that
unity
imagine
what
would
be
possible
right
now
with
ideas
that
are
bold
enough
to
meet
the
challenges
of
our
time
but
big
enough
as
well
that
they
could
unify
the
american
people
that's
what
presidential
leadership
can
do
that's
what
the
presidency
is
for
and
that
is
why
i'm
asking
for
your
vote
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
kamala
harris
harris
thank
you
it's
great
to
be
back
at
tsu
so
i
plan
on
spending
tonight
talking
with
you
about
my
plans
to
address
the
problems
that
keep
you
up
at
night
but
first
i
have
a
few
words
for
donald
trump
who
we
all
know
is
watching
laughter
so
president
trump
you've
spent
the
last
two-and-a-half
years
full-time
trying
to
sow
hate
and
division
among
us
and
that
is
why
we've
gotten
nothing
done
you
have
used
hate
intimidation
fear
and
over
lies
as
a
way
to
distract
from
your
failed
policies
and
your
broken
promises
the
only
reason
you've
not
been
indicted
is
because
there
was
a
memo
in
the
department
of
justice
that
says
a
sitting
president
cannot
be
charged
with
a
crime
but
here's
what
you
don't
get
what
you
don't
get
you
is
that
the
american
people
are
so
much
better
than
this
and
we
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
us
have
so
much
more
in
common
than
what
separates
us
regardless
of
our
race
where
we
live
or
the
party
with
which
we're
registered
to
vote
and
i
plan
on
focusing
on
our
common
issues
our
common
hopes
and
desires
and
in
that
way
unifying
our
country
winning
this
election
and
turning
the
page
for
america
and
now
president
trump
you
can
go
back
to
watching
fox
news
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
bernie
sanders
senator
sanders
sanders
let
me
be
blunt
and
tell
you
what
you
don't
hear
much
about
in
congress
or
in
the
media
and
that
is
it
goes
without
saying
that
we
must
and
will
defeat
trump
the
most
dangerous
president
in
the
history
of
this
country
applause
but
we
must
do
more
we
must
do
more
we
have
got
to
recognize
that
this
country
is
moving
into
an
oligarchic
form
of
society
where
a
handful
of
billionaires
control
the
economic
and
political
life
of
this
country
and
as
president
i
am
prepared
to
take
them
on
yes
we
will
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
a
living
wage
yes
we
will
finally
make
sure
that
every
american
has
health
care
as
a
human
right
not
a
privilege
and
yes
we
will
address
the
catastrophic
crisis
of
climate
change
and
transform
our
energy
system
away
from
fossil
fuel
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
elizabeth
warren
warren
so
i
was
born
and
raised
in
oklahoma
but
i'm
sure
glad
to
be
in
texas
tonight
applause
all
three
of
my
brothers
served
in
military
bases
here
in
texas
that
was
their
ticket
to
the
middle
class
me
i
got
my
big
opportunity
about
a
half-mile
down
the
road
from
here
at
the
university
of
houston
back
when
it
cost
a
semester
applause
for
a
price
that
i
could
pay
for
on
a
part-time
waitressing
job
i
got
to
finish
my
four-year
degree
and
i
became
a
special
needs
teacher
and
after
law
school
my
first
big
job
was
back
here
in
houston
by
then
i
had
two
little
kids
and
when
childcare
nearly
brought
me
down
my
aunt
bee
moved
in
and
saved
us
all
the
paths
to
america's
middle
class
have
gotten
a
lot
smaller
and
a
lot
narrower
today
service-members
are
preyed
upon
by
predatory
lenders
students
are
crushed
by
debt
and
families
cannot
afford
childcare
applause
i
know
what's
broken
i
know
how
to
fix
it
and
i'm
going
to
lead
the
fight
to
get
it
done

joe
biden
joe
biden
d
former
vice
president
presidential
candidate
you
know
when
president
kennedy
announced
the
moon
shot
he
used
a
phrase
that
sticks
with
me
my
whole
life
he
said
we're
doing
it
because
we
refuse
to
postpone
well
i
refuse
to
postpone
one
more
minute
spending
billions
of
dollars
on
curing
cancer
alzheimer's
and
other
diseases
which
if
we
invest
in
them
we
can
find
cures
i
refuse
to
postpone
giving
single
child
in
america
no
matter
their
zip
code
pre-k
all
the
way
through
high
school
and
beyond
i
refuse
to
postpone
any
longer
taking
on
climate
change
and
leading
the
world
in
taking
on
climate
change
look
this
is
the
united
states
of
america
there
has
never
been
a
single
solitary
time
when
we've
set
our
mind
to
something
we've
been
unable
to
do
it
we're
walking
around
with
our
heads
down
like
woe
is
me
we're
the
best-equipped
nation
in
the
world
to
take
this
on
it's
no
longer
time
to
postpone
we
should
get
moving
there's
enormous
enormous
opportunities
once
we
get
rid
of
donald
trump
applause
stephanopoulos
candidates
thank
you
several
of
you
said
you
are
more
united
than
divided
and
that
is
certainly
true
all
of
you
agree
on
one
big
thing
the
goal
of
defeating
president
trump
driving
the
country
in
a
new
direction
but
out
on
the
campaign
trail
you
have
outlined
big
differences
over
how
far
to
go
and
how
fast
to
go
and
vice
president
biden
the
differences
between
you
and
the
senators
on
either
side
of
you
tonight
strike
at
the
heart
of
this
primary
debate
both
senators
warren
and
sanders
want
to
replace
obamacare
with
medicare
for
all
you
want
to
build
on
obamacare
not
scrap
it
they
propose
spending
far
more
than
you
to
combat
climate
change
and
tackle
student
loan
debt
and
they
would
raise
more
in
taxes
than
you
to
pay
for
their
programs
are
senators
warren
and
sanders
pushing
too
far
beyond
where
democrats
want
to
go
and
where
the
country
needs
to
go
biden
that
will
be
for
the
voters
to
decide
that
question
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
we
should
have
a
debate
on
health
care
i
think
i
know
that
the
senator
says
she's
for
bernie
well
i'm
for
barack
i
think
the
obamacare
worked
i
think
the
way
we
add
to
it
replace
everything
that
has
been
cut
add
a
public
option
guarantee
that
everyone
will
be
able
to
have
affordable
insurance
number
one
number
two
i
think
we
should
be
in
a
position
of
taking
a
look
at
what
costs
are
my
plan
for
health
care
costs
a
lot
of
money
it
costs
billion
it
doesn't
cost
trillion
trillion
a
year
it
turns
out
is
twice
what
the
entire
federal
budget
is
that's
before
exists
now
without
interest
on
the
debt
how
are
we
going
to
pay
for
it
i
want
to
hear
that
tonight
how
that's
happened
thus
far
my
distinguished
friend
the
senator
on
my
left
has
not
indicated
how
she
pays
for
it
and
the
senator
has
in
fact
come
forward
and
said
how
he's
going
to
pay
for
it
but
it
gets
him
about
halfway
there
there's
a
lot
of
other
things
that
need
to
be
done
i
have
a
bold
plan
to
deal
with
making
sure
we
triple
the
money
for
at-risk
schools
that
are
title
i
schools
from
to
billion
a
year
but
i
go
down
the
line
and
these
are
things
we're
talking
about
i
lay
out
how
i
can
pay
for
it
how
i
can
get
it
done
and
why
it's
better
stephanopoulos
senator
warren
let
me
take
that
to
you
particularly
on
what
senator
biden
was
saying
there
about
health
care
he
has
actually
praised
bernie
sanders
for
being
candid
about
his
health
care
plan
that
senator
says
that
sanders
has
been
candid
about
the
fact
that
middle
class
taxes
are
going
to
go
up
and
most
of
private
insurance
is
going
to
be
eliminated
will
you
make
that
same
admission
warren
so
let's
be
clear
about
health
care
and
let's
actually
start
where
vice
president
did
we
all
owe
a
huge
debt
to
president
obama
who
fundamentally
transformed
health
care
in
america
and
committed
this
country
to
health
care
for
every
human
being
applause
and
now
the
question
is
how
best
can
we
improve
on
it
and
i
believe
the
best
way
we
can
do
that
is
we
make
sure
that
everybody
gets
covered
by
health
care
at
the
lowest
possible
cost
how
do
we
pay
for
it
we
pay
for
it
those
at
the
very
top
the
richest
individuals
and
the
biggest
corporations
are
going
to
pay
more
and
middle
class
families
are
going
to
pay
less
that's
how
this
is
going
to
work
applause
stephanopoulos
direct
question
you
said
middle
class
families
are
going
to
pay
less
but
will
middle
class
taxes
go
up
to
pail
for
pay
for
the
program
i
know
you
believe
that
the
deductibles
and
the
premiums
will
go
down
will
middle
class
taxes
go
up
will
private
insurance
be
eliminated
warren
look
what
families
have
to
deal
with
is
cost
total
cost
that's
what
they
have
to
deal
with
and
understand
families
are
paying
for
their
health
care
today
families
pay
every
time
an
insurance
company
says
sorry
you
can't
see
that
specialist
every
time
an
insurance
company
says
sorry
that
doctor
is
out
of
network
sorry
we
are
not
covering
that
prescription
families
are
paying
every
time
they
don't
get
a
prescription
filled
because
they
can't
pay
for
it
they
don't
have
a
lump
checked
out
because
they
can't
afford
the
co-pay
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what's
going
to
happen
in
families
pockets
what's
going
to
happen
in
their
budgets
and
the
answer
is
on
medicare
for
all
costs
are
going
to
go
up
for
wealthier
individuals
and
costs
are
going
to
go
up
for
giant
corporations
but
for
hard-working
families
across
this
country
costs
are
going
to
go
down
and
that's
how
it
should
work
under
medicare
for
all
in
our
health
care
system
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
sanders
you
were
invoked
by
the
vice
president
also
take
on
that
question
about
taxes
sanders
well
joe
said
that
medicare
for
all
would
cost
over
trillion
that's
right
joe
status
quo
over
years
will
be
trillion
every
study
done
shows
that
medicare
for
all
is
the
most
cost-effective
approach
to
providing
health
care
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
country
i
who
wrote
the
damn
bill
if
i
may
say
so
applause
intend
to
eliminate
all
out-of-pocket
expenses
all
deductibles
all
co-payments
nobody
in
america
will
pay
more
than
a
year
for
prescription
drugs
because
we're
going
to
stand
up
to
the
greed
and
corruption
and
price-fixing
of
the
pharmaceutical
industry
applause
we
need
we
need
a
health
care
system
that
guarantees
health
care
to
all
people
as
every
other
major
country
does
not
a
system
which
provides
billion
a
year
in
profit
for
the
drug
companies
and
the
insurance
companies
and
i'll
tell
you
how
absurd
the
system
is
tonight
on
abc
the
health
care
industry
will
be
advertising
telling
you
how
bad
medicare
for
all
is
because
they
want
to
protect
their
profits
that
is
absurd
applause
stephanopoulos
vice
president
biden
klobuchar
if
i
could
respond
george
stephanopoulos
you
get
a
response
and
then
we're
going
to
broaden
out
the
discussion
biden
ok
number
one
my
health
care
plan
does
significantly
cut
the
costs
of
the
largest
out-of-pocket
payment
you'll
pay
is
you'll
be
able
to
get
into
a
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
et
cetera
but
guess
what
of
the
million
people
who
like
their
health
care
now
they
can
keep
it
if
they
don't
like
it
they
can
leave
number
one
number
two
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we're
in
a
situation
where
if
you
notice
he
hasn't
answered
the
question
this
is
about
candor
honesty
big
ideas
let's
have
a
big
idea
the
tax
of
percent
that
the
senator
is
talking
about
that
raises
about
billion
guess
what
that
leaves
you
billion
short
the
senator
said
before
it's
going
to
cost
you
in
your
pay
there
will
be
a
deductible
in
your
paycheck
you're
going
to
the
middle
class
person
someone
making
grand
with
three
kids
they're
going
to
end
up
paying
more
they're
going
to
end
up
paying
percent
more
on
their
income
tax
that's
a
reality
now
it's
not
a
bad
idea
if
you
like
it
i
don't
like
it
stephanopoulos
ok
now
i
want
everybody
to
keep
to
the
time
but
you
did
invoke
both
senators
i
have
to
get
responses
from
them
biden
sure
no
that's
good
stephanopoulos
and
then
we
will
broaden
it
out
senator
warren
you
go
first
warren
so
let's
be
clear
i've
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
applause
i've
met
people
who
like
their
doctors
i've
met
people
who
like
their
nurses
i've
met
people
who
like
their
pharmacists
i've
met
people
who
like
their
physical
therapists
what
they
want
is
access
to
health
care
and
we
just
need
to
be
clear
about
what
medicare
for
all
is
all
about
instead
of
paying
premiums
into
insurance
companies
and
then
having
insurance
companies
build
their
profits
by
saying
no
to
coverage
we're
going
to
do
this
by
saying
everyone
is
covered
by
medicare
for
all
every
health
care
provider
is
covered
and
the
only
question
here
in
terms
of
difference
is
where
to
send
the
bill
stephanopoulos
senator
sanders
sanders
let
us
be
clear
joe
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
spending
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
health
care
as
the
canadians
or
any
other
major
country
on
earth
biden
this
is
america
sanders
yes
but
americans
don't
want
to
pay
twice
as
much
as
other
countries
and
they
guarantee
health
care
to
all
people
under
my
medicare
for
all
proposal
when
you
don't
pay
out-of-pocket
and
you
don't
pay
premiums
maybe
you've
run
into
people
who
love
their
premiums
i
haven't
what
people
want
is
cost-effective
health
care
medicare
for
all
will
save
the
average
american
substantial
sums
of
money
on
his
or
her
health
care
bill
stephanopoulos
senator
klobuchar
you
said
in
your
opening
statement
you
don't
you
want
to
represent
the
people
stuck
in
the
middle
of
the
extremes
who
represents
the
extreme
on
this
stage
klobuchar
i
think
you
know
that
i
don't
agree
with
some
of
these
proposals
up
here
george
so
i'm
talking
about
stephanopoulos
which
ones
klobuchar
if
i
could
if
i
could
respond
to
some
of
the
proposals
from
my
friends
first
of
all
senator
sanders
and
i
have
worked
valiantly
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
pharmaceuticals
that
was
a
klobuchar-sanders
amendment
to
allow
for
drugs
to
come
in
from
less
expensive
countries
like
canada
we
have
worked
to
bring
down
the
cost
by
fighting
to
allow
million
seniors
that's
a
bill
i
lead
to
negotiate
for
better
prices
under
medicare
i
figure
that's
a
lot
of
seniors
and
they
should
be
allowed
to
get
a
better
price
but
when
it
comes
to
our
health
care
and
when
it
comes
to
our
premiums
i
go
with
the
doctor's
creed
which
is
do
no
harm
and
while
bernie
wrote
the
bill
i
read
the
bill
and
on
page
eight
on
page
eight
of
the
bill
it
says
that
we
will
no
longer
have
private
insurance
as
we
know
it
and
that
means
that
million
americans
will
no
longer
be
able
to
have
their
current
insurance
that's
in
four
years
i
don't
think
that's
a
bold
idea
i
think
it's
a
bad
idea
and
what
i
favor
is
something
that
what
barack
obama
wanted
to
do
from
the
very
beginning
and
that
is
a
public
option
a
non-profit
choice
that
would
bring
down
the
cost
of
insurance
cover
million
more
people
and
bring
down
the
prices
for
million
more
people
that
is
a
bold
idea
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
warren
page
eight
of
the
bill
she
says
people
will
lose
their
health
insurance
warren
i'm
sorry
stephanopoulos
she
said
page
eight
of
the
bill
million
people
will
lose
their
health
insurance
klobuchar
current
health
insurance
biden
one
hundred
forty-nine
million
stephanopoulos
million
excuse
me
warren
so
let's
be
clear
about
this
people
will
have
access
to
all
of
their
doctors
all
of
their
nurses
their
community
hospitals
their
rural
hospitals
doctors
won't
have
to
hire
people
to
fill
out
crazy
forms
they
won't
have
to
spend
time
on
the
phone
arguing
with
insurance
companies
people
who
have
sick
family
members
won't
have
to
get
into
these
battles
what
this
is
about
is
making
sure
that
we
have
the
most
efficient
way
possible
to
pay
for
health
care
for
everyone
in
this
country
insurance
companies
last
year
sucked
billion
in
profits
out
of
the
system
how
did
they
make
that
money
every
one
of
those
billion
was
made
by
an
insurance
company
saying
no
to
your
health
care
coverage
stephanopoulos
mayor
buttigieg
buttigieg
the
problem
senator
sanders
with
that
damn
bill
that
you
wrote
and
that
senator
warren
backs
is
that
it
doesn't
trust
the
american
people
i
trust
you
to
choose
what
makes
the
most
sense
for
you
not
my
way
or
the
highway
now
look
i
think
we
do
have
to
go
far
beyond
tinkering
with
the
aca
i
propose
medicare
for
all
who
want
it
we
take
a
version
of
medicare
we
make
it
available
for
the
american
people
and
if
we're
right
as
progressives
that
that
public
alternative
is
better
then
the
american
people
will
figure
that
out
for
themselves
i
trust
the
american
people
to
make
the
right
choice
for
them
why
don't
you
stephanopoulos
senator
sanders
seconds
sanders
george
you
talked
about
was
it
million
people
on
private
insurance
fifty
million
of
those
people
lose
their
private
insurance
every
year
when
they
quit
their
jobs
or
they
go
unemployed
or
their
employer
changes
their
insurance
policy
medicare
for
all
is
comprehensive
health
care
covers
all
basic
needs
including
home
health
care
it
allows
you
to
go
to
any
doctor
you
want
which
many
private
insurance
company
programs
do
not
so
if
you
want
comprehensive
health
care
freedom
of
choice
regarding
doctor
or
hospital
no
more
than
a
year
for
prescription
drugs
taking
on
the
drug
companies
and
the
insurance
companies
moving
to
medicare
for
all
is
the
way
to
go
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
harris
you
startled
out
co-sponsoring
senator
sanders's
bill
you
now
say
you're
uncomfortable
with
it
why
harris
i
want
to
give
credit
first
to
barack
obama
for
really
bringing
us
this
far
we
would
not
be
here
if
he
hadn't
the
courage
the
talent
or
the
will
to
see
us
this
far
i
want
to
give
credit
to
bernie
take
credit
bernie
you
know
you
brought
us
this
far
on
medicare
for
all
i
support
medicare
for
all
i
always
have
but
i
wanted
to
make
the
plan
better
which
i
did
which
is
about
offering
people
choice
not
taking
that
from
them
so
under
my
medicare
for
all
plan
people
have
the
choice
of
a
private
plan
or
a
public
plan
because
that's
what
people
want
and
i
agree
we
shouldn't
take
choice
from
people
but
here's
the
thing
everybody
on
this
stage
i
do
believe
is
well
intentioned
and
wants
that
all
americans
have
coverage
and
recognizes
that
right
now
million
americans
don't
have
coverage
but
at
least
five
people
have
talked
some
repeatedly
on
this
subject
and
not
once
have
we
talked
about
donald
trump
so
let's
talk
about
the
fact
that
donald
trump
came
into
office
and
spent
almost
the
entire
first
year
of
his
term
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
affordable
care
act
we
all
fought
against
it
and
then
the
late
great
john
mccain
at
that
moment
at
about
o'clock
in
the
morning
killed
his
attempt
to
take
health
care
from
millions
of
people
in
this
country
applause
fast
forward
to
today
and
what
is
happening
donald
trump's
department
of
justice
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
affordable
care
act
donald
trump's
administration
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
ban
that
we
placed
on
denying
people
who
have
pre-existing
conditions
coverage
donald
trump
is
trying
to
say
that
our
kids
up
to
the
age
of
can
no
longer
be
on
our
plans
and
frankly
i
think
this
discussion
has
given
the
american
public
a
headache
what
they
want
to
know
is
that
they're
going
to
have
health
care
and
cost
will
not
be
a
barrier
to
getting
it
but
let's
focus
on
the
end
goal
if
we
don't
get
donald
trump
out
of
office
he's
going
to
get
rid
of
all
of
it
biden

let
me
get
to
congressman
o'rourke
and
then
bring
you
go
ahead
mr
vice
president
biden
fifteen
seconds
look
everybody
says
we
want
an
option
the
option
i'm
proposing
is
medicare
for
all
medicare
for
choice
if
you
want
medicare
if
you
lose
the
job
from
your
insurance
from
your
employer
you
automatically
can
buy
into
this
you
don't
have
no
pre-existing
condition
can
stop
you
from
buying
in
you
get
covered
period
and
if
you
notice
nobody's
yet
said
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
the
taxpayer
i
hear
this
large
savings
the
president
thinks
my
friend
from
vermont
thinks
that
the
employer's
going
to
give
you
back
if
you
negotiated
as
a
union
all
these
years
got
a
cut
in
wages
because
you
got
insurance
they're
going
to
give
back
that
money
to
the
employee
sanders
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
will
in
our
bill
biden
well
let
me
tell
you
something
for
a
socialist
you've
got
for
a
socialist
you've
got
a
lot
more
confidence
in
corporate
america
than
i
do
stephanopoulos
senator
sanders
sanders
ok
one
minute
george
stephanopoulos
go
ahead
sanders
all
right
two
points
you
got
to
defend
the
fact
that
today
not
only
do
we
have
million
people
uninsured
and
underinsured
you
got
to
defend
the
fact
that
americans
are
going
bankrupt
you
know
why
they're
going
bankrupt
because
they
suffered
a
terrible
disease
cancer
or
heart
disease
under
my
legislation
people
will
not
go
into
financial
ruin
because
they
suffered
with
a
diagnosis
of
cancer
and
our
program
is
the
only
one
that
does
that
biden
i
know
a
lot
about
cancer
let
me
tell
you
something
it's
personal
to
me
let
me
tell
you
something
every
single
person
who
is
diagnosed
with
cancer
or
any
other
disease
can
automatically
become
part
of
this
plan
they
will
not
go
bankrupt
because
of
that
they
will
not
go
bankrupt
because
of
that
they
can
join
immediately
and
we're
talking
four
six
eight
ten
years
depending
on
who
you
talk
about
before
we
get
to
medicare
for
all
come
on
i've
been
there
you've
been
there
you
know
what
it's
like
people
need
help
now
hope
now
and
do
something
now
applause
stephanopoulos
congressman
o'rourke
o'rourke
yeah
thank
you
listen
i'm
grateful
that
we
all
agree
about
the
urgency
of
this
challenge
and
the
fact
that
donald
trump
is
undermining
the
limited
protections
that
we
have
right
now
but
i
also
think
we're
being
offered
a
false
choice
between
those
who
propose
an
all-or-nothing
gambit
forcing
tens
of
millions
off
of
insurance
that
they
like
that
works
for
them
to
force
them
onto
medicare
and
others
who
want
to
as
the
vice
president
does
incrementally
improve
what
we
have
which
will
still
leave
many
maybe
millions
uninsured
and
uncared
for
in
a
state
like
texas
where
the
largest
provider
of
mental
health
care
services
is
the
county
jail
system
we've
got
to
do
better
in
my
proposal
medicare
for
america
says
everyone
who's
uninsured
will
be
enrolled
in
medicare
everyone
who's
insufficiently
insured
cannot
afford
it
can
move
over
to
medicare
and
those
like
members
of
unions
who've
fought
for
the
health
care
plans
that
work
for
them
and
their
families
are
able
to
keep
them
this
is
the
best
possible
path
forward
biden
you
just
described
my
plan
ph
stephanopoulos
this
is
health
care
is
the
top
issue
for
everyone
in
the
country
i
want
to
make
sure
everyone
gets
one
minute
to
respond
so
secretary
castro
andrew
yang
and
then
senator
booker
you
will
get
a
minute
castro
thank
you
and
you
know
i
also
want
to
recognize
the
work
that
bernie
has
done
on
this
and
of
course
we
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
president
barack
obama
of
course
i
also
worked
for
president
obama
vice
president
biden
and
i
know
that
the
problem
with
your
plan
is
that
it
leaves
million
people
uncovered
now
on
the
last
debate
stage
in
detroit
you
said
that
wasn't
true
when
senator
harris
brought
that
up
there
was
a
fact
check
of
that
and
they
said
that
was
true
you
know
i
grew
up
with
a
grandmother
who
had
type
diabetes
and
i
watched
her
condition
get
worse
and
worse
but
that
whole
time
she
had
medicare
i
want
every
single
american
family
to
have
a
strong
medicare
plan
available
if
they
choose
to
hold
on
to
strong
solid
private
health
insurance
i
believe
they
should
be
able
to
do
but
the
difference
between
what
i
support
and
what
you
support
vice
president
biden
is
that
you
require
them
to
opt
in
and
i
would
not
require
them
to
opt
in
they
would
automatically
be
enrolled
they
wouldn't
have
a
buy
in
that's
a
big
difference
because
barack
obama's
vision
was
not
to
leave
million
people
uncovered
he
wanted
every
single
person
in
this
country
covered
my
plan
would
do
that
your
plan
would
not
biden
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
castro
you
just
said
that
you
just
said
that
two
minutes
ago
you
just
two
minutes
ago
that
they
would
have
to
buy
in
biden
do
not
have
to
buy
in
if
you
can't
afford
it
castro
you
said
they
would
have
to
buy
in
biden
your
grandmother
would
not
have
to
buy
in
if
she
qualifies
for
medicaid
she
would
automatically
be
enrolled
castro
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
two
minutes
ago
i
mean
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
you're
forgetting
that
biden
i
said
anyone
like
your
grandmother
who
has
no
money
castro
i
mean
look
look
we
need
a
health
care
system
biden
she
you're
automatically
enrolled
castro
it
automatically
enrolls
people
regardless
of
whether
they
choose
to
opt
in
or
not
if
you
lose
your
job
for
instance
his
health
care
plan
would
not
automatically
enroll
you
you
would
have
to
opt
in
my
health
care
plan
would
that's
a
big
difference
i'm
fulfilling
the
legacy
of
barack
obama
and
you're
not
biden
that'll
be
a
surprise
to
him
stephanopoulos
andrew
yang
yang
come
on
guys
buttigieg
this
is
why
presidential
debates
are
becoming
unwatchable
klobuchar
yeah
buttigieg
this
reminds
everybody
of
what
they
cannot
stand
about
washington
scoring
points
against
each
other
poking
at
each
other
and
telling
each
other
that
my
plan
your
plan
look
we
all
have
different
visions
for
what
is
better
castro
yeah
that's
called
the
democratic
primary
election
pete
that's
called
an
election
applause
that's
an
election
you
know
this
is
what
we're
here
for
it's
an
election
klobuchar
yes
but
a
house
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
and
that
is
not
how
we're
going
to
win
this
applause
yang
look
everyone
we
know
we're
on
the
same
team
here
we
know
we're
on
the
same
team
we
all
have
a
better
vision
for
health
care
than
our
current
president
and
i
believe
we're
talking
about
this
the
wrong
way
as
someone
who
has
run
a
business
i
know
that
our
current
health
care
system
makes
it
harder
to
hire
people
makes
it
harder
to
give
them
benefits
and
treat
them
as
full-time
employees
you
instead
pretend
their
contractors
it's
harder
to
change
jobs
it's
certainly
harder
to
start
a
business
the
pitch
we
have
to
make
to
the
american
people
is
we
will
get
the
health
care
weight
off
of
your
backs
and
then
unleash
the
hopes
and
dreams
of
the
american
people
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
booker
yang
now
i
am
asian
so
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
and
they
tell
me
that
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
paperwork
avoiding
being
sued
and
navigating
the
insurance
bureaucracy
we
have
to
change
the
incentives
so
instead
of
revenue
and
activity
people
are
focused
on
our
health
in
the
health
care
system
and
the
cleveland
clinic
where
they're
paid
not
based
upon
how
many
procedures
they
prescribe
shocker
they
prescribe
fewer
procedures
and
patient
health
stays
the
same
or
improves
that
is
the
pitch
to
the
american
people
stephanopoulos
senator
booker
close
out
this
discussion
booker
thank
you
very
much
look
there
are
a
lot
of
people
watching
at
home
right
now
listening
to
us
that
are
afraid
because
they
are
in
crisis
they
don't
have
health
insurance
their
health
insurance
doesn't
go
far
enough
they
can't
afford
their
prescription
drugs
look
i'm
clear
in
what
i
believe
i
believe
in
medicare
for
all
i
believe
it's
the
best
way
to
rationalize
the
system
but
dear
god
i
know
every
one
of
my
colleagues
on
this
stage
is
in
favor
of
universal
health
coverage
and
comes
at
this
with
the
best
of
intentions
and
i'll
tell
you
there
is
an
urgency
right
now
in
this
nation
everybody
feels
it
and
as
a
person
who
has
an
ideal
i
know
we
cannot
sacrifice
progress
on
the
altar
of
purity
because
people
in
my
community
they
need
help
right
now
they
have
high
blood
pressure
right
now
they
have
unaffordable
insulin
right
now
and
this
must
be
a
moment
where
we
as
democrats
can
begin
to
show
that
we
cannot
only
stake
and
stand
our
ground
but
find
common
ground
because
we've
got
one
shot
to
make
donald
trump
a
one-term
president
applause
and
we
cannot
lose
it
by
the
way
we
talk
about
each
other
or
demonize
and
degrade
each
other
we
can
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the
same
time
if
i
am
the
leader
i
will
work
towards
the
ideal
of
health
insurance
health
coverage
being
a
right
for
all
americans
but
every
single
day
i'll
join
with
other
democrats
to
make
progress
happen
in
our
nation
for
the
people
that
are
struggling
and
suffering
today
stephanopoulos
candidates
thank
you
linsey
davis
davis
thanks
george
since
we're
here
at
an
hbcu
i'd
like
to
start
with
young
black
voters
several
recent
polls
indicate
their
number-one
concern
is
racism
this
campus
this
state
and
this
nation
are
still
raw
from
that
racially
motivated
attack
on
latinos
in
el
paso
now
we
know
that
the
racial
divide
started
long
before
president
trump
and
president
obama
but
each
of
you
on
this
stage
has
said
that
president
trump
has
made
that
divide
worse
congressman
o'rourke
coming
to
you
first
why
are
you
the
most
qualified
candidate
to
address
this
divide
o'rourke
you
know
i
called
this
out
in
no
uncertain
terms
on
august
rd
and
every
day
since
then
and
i
was
talking
about
it
long
before
then
as
well
racism
in
america
is
endemic
it
is
foundational
we
can
mark
the
creation
of
this
country
not
at
the
fourth
of
july
but
august
when
the
first
kidnapped
african
applause
was
brought
to
this
country
against
his
will
and
in
bondage
and
as
a
slave
built
the
greatness
and
the
success
and
the
wealth
that
neither
he
nor
his
descendants
would
ever
be
able
to
fully
participate
in
and
enjoy
we
have
to
be
able
to
answer
this
challenge
and
it
is
found
in
our
education
system
where
in
texas
a
year-old
child
in
kindergarten
is
five
times
as
likely
to
be
disciplined
or
suspended
or
expelled
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin
applause
in
our
health
care
system
where
there's
a
maternal
mortality
crisis
three
times
as
deadly
for
women
of
color
or
the
fact
that
there's
times
the
wealth
in
white
america
than
there
is
in
black
america
i'm
going
to
follow
sheila
jackson
lee's
lead
and
sign
into
law
a
reparations
bill
that
will
allow
us
to
address
this
at
its
foundation
applause
but
we
will
also
call
out
the
fact
that
we
have
a
white
supremacist
in
the
white
house
and
he
poses
a
mortal
threat
to
people
of
color
all
across
this
country
applause
davis
secretary
castro
seconds
to
respond
castro
look
you
know
i
want
to
commend
beto
for
how
well
he
has
spoken
to
the
passion
and
the
frustration
and
the
sadness
after
what
happened
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
he's
done
a
great
job
with
that
look
a
few
weeks
ago
a
shooter
drove
miles
inspired
by
this
hours
inspired
by
this
president
to
kill
people
who
look
like
me
and
people
who
look
like
my
family
white
supremacy
is
a
growing
threat
to
this
country
and
we
have
to
root
it
out
i'm
proud
that
i
put
forward
a
plan
to
disarm
hate
i'm
also
proud
that
i
was
the
first
to
put
forward
a
police
reform
plan
because
we're
not
going
to
have
any
more
laquan
mcdonalds
or
eric
garners
or
michael
browns
or
pamela
turners
or
walter
scotts
or
sandra
bland
here
from
the
houston
area
we
need
to
root
out
racism
and
i
believe
that
we
can
do
that
because
that
doesn't
represent
the
vast
majority
of
americans
who
do
have
a
good
heart
they
also
need
a
leader
to
match
that
and
i
will
be
a
president
that
matches
that
davis
senator
booker
you
have
said
quote
the
real
question
isn't
who
is
or
isn't
a
racist
it's
who
is
going
to
do
something
about
it
senator
what
do
you
plan
to
do
about
it
booker
well
first
and
foremost
i
want
to
hit
that
point
because
we
know
donald
trump's
a
racist
but
there
is
no
red
badge
of
courage
for
calling
him
that
racism
exists
the
question
isn't
who
isn't
a
racist
it's
who
is
and
isn't
doing
something
about
racism
and
this
is
not
just
an
issue
that
started
yesterday
it's
not
just
an
issue
that
we
hear
a
president
that
can't
condemn
white
supremacy
we
have
systemic
racism
that
is
eroding
our
nation
from
health
care
to
the
criminal
justice
system
and
it's
nice
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
slavery
but
dear
god
we
have
a
criminal
justice
system
that
is
so
racially
biased
we
have
more
african-americans
under
criminal
supervision
today
than
all
the
slaves
in
we
have
to
come
at
this
issue
attacking
systemic
racism
having
the
courage
to
call
it
out
and
having
a
plan
to
do
something
about
it
if
i
am
president
of
the
united
states
we
will
create
an
office
in
the
white
house
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
white
supremacy
and
hate
crimes
applause
and
we
will
make
sure
that
systemic
racism
is
dealt
with
in
substantive
plans
from
criminal
justice
reform
to
the
disparities
in
health
care
to
even
one
that
we
don't
talk
about
enough
which
is
the
racism
that
we
see
in
environmental
injustice
in
communities
of
color
all
around
this
country
applause
davis
mayor
buttigieg
you've
been
struggling
with
issues
around
race
in
your
own
community
you've
also
said
that
anyone
who
votes
to
re-elect
president
trump
is
at
best
looking
the
other
way
on
racism
does
that
sort
of
talk
alienate
voters
and
potentially
deepen
divisions
in
our
country
buttigieg
i
believe
what's
deepened
divisions
in
the
country
is
the
conduct
of
this
president
and
we
have
a
chance
to
change
all
of
that
look
systemic
racism
preceded
this
president
and
even
when
we
defeat
him
it
will
be
with
us
that's
why
we
need
a
systemic
approach
to
dismantle
it
it's
it's
not
enough
to
just
take
a
racist
policy
replace
it
with
a
neutral
one
and
expect
things
will
just
get
better
on
their
own
harms
compound
in
the
same
way
that
a
dollar
saved
compounds
so
does
a
dollar
stolen
and
we
know
that
the
generational
theft
of
the
descendants
of
slaves
is
part
of
why
everything
from
housing
to
education
to
health
to
employment
basically
puts
us
in
two
different
countries
i
have
proposed
the
most
comprehensive
vision
to
tackle
systemic
racism
in
every
one
of
these
areas
marshaling
as
many
resources
as
went
into
the
marshall
plan
that
rebuilt
europe
but
this
time
a
douglass
plan
that
we
invest
right
here
at
home
to
make
sure
that
we're
not
only
dealing
with
things
like
the
overincarceration
of
black
americans
but
also
black
solutions
entrepreneurship
raising
to
percent
applause
the
target
for
the
federal
government
to
do
business
with
minority-owned
businesses
investing
in
hbcus
that
are
training
and
educating
the
next
generation
of
entrepreneurs
applause
we
can
and
must
do
that
but
that
means
transcending
this
framework
that
pits
us
against
each
other
that
pits
a
single
black
mother
of
three
against
a
displaced
auto
worker
because
when
i
where
i
come
from
a
lot
of
times
that
displaced
auto
worker
is
a
single
black
mother
of
three
we've
got
to
say
that
applause
and
bring
people
together
davis
also
a
concern
for
people
of
color
is
criminal
justice
reform
senator
harris
you
released
your
plan
for
that
just
this
week
and
it
does
contradict
some
of
your
prior
positions
among
them
you
used
to
oppose
the
legalization
of
marijuana
now
you
don't
you
used
to
oppose
outside
investigations
of
police
shootings
now
you
don't
you've
said
that
you
changed
on
these
and
other
things
because
you
were
quote
swimming
against
the
current
and
thankfully
the
currents
have
changed
but
when
you
had
the
power
why
didn't
you
try
to
effect
change
then
applause
ph
harris
so
there
have
been
there
have
been
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
this
question
and
there
have
been
many
distortions
of
my
record
let
me
be
very
clear
i
made
a
decision
to
become
a
prosecutor
for
two
reasons
one
i've
always
wanted
to
protect
people
and
keep
them
safe
and
second
i
was
born
knowing
about
how
this
criminal
justice
system
in
america
has
worked
in
a
way
that
has
been
informed
by
racial
bias
and
i
could
tell
you
extensively
about
the
experiences
i
and
my
family
members
have
personally
had
but
i
made
a
decision
that
if
i
was
going
to
have
the
ability
to
reform
the
system
i
would
try
to
do
it
from
the
inside
and
so
i
took
on
the
position
that
allowed
me
without
asking
permission
to
create
one
of
the
first
in
the
nation
initiatives
that
was
a
model
and
became
a
national
model
around
people
who
were
arrested
for
drugs
and
getting
them
jobs
i
created
one
of
the
first
in
the
nation
requirements
that
a
state
law
enforcement
agency
would
have
to
wear
cameras
and
keep
them
on
full-time
i
created
one
of
the
first
in
the
nation
trainings
for
a
police
officer
on
the
issue
of
racial
bias
and
the
need
to
reform
the
system
was
i
able
to
get
enough
done
absolutely
not
but
my
plan
has
been
described
by
activists
as
being
a
bold
and
comprehensive
plan
that
is
about
ending
mass
incarceration
about
taking
the
profit
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system
i
plan
on
shutting
down
for-profit
prisons
on
day
one
applause
it
will
be
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
hold
law
enforcement
including
prosecutors
accountable
and
finally
my
plan
is
about
making
sure
that
in
america's
criminal
justice
system
we
de-incarcerate
women
and
children
that
we
end
solitary
confinement
and
that
we
work
on
keeping
families
intact
and
as
president
of
the
united
states
knowing
the
system
from
the
inside
i
will
have
the
ability
to
be
an
effective
leader
and
get
this
job
complete
davis
thank
you
senator
harris
applause
senator
klobuchar
during
your
eight
years
as
a
prosecutor
in
minnesota
there
were
dozens
of
incidents
where
black
men
were
killed
by
police
critics
say
that
too
often
you
sided
with
police
in
these
cases
the
aclu's
legal
director
in
minnesota
has
said
that
you
showed
no
interest
in
racial
justice
do
you
wish
now
that
you
had
done
more
klobuchar
that's
not
my
record
unknown
inaudible
klobuchar
we
are
here
at
a
historically
black
college
and
i
think
of
an
alum
of
that
college
barbara
jordan
and
something
that
she
once
said
she
said
what
the
people
want
is
simple
they
want
a
country
as
good
as
its
promise
and
that
same
can
be
said
of
the
criminal
justice
system
so
when
i
was
there
the
way
we
handled
these
police
shootings
i
actually
took
a
stand
to
make
sure
outside
investigators
handled
them
i
took
on
our
major
police
chief
in
minneapolis
but
in
the
prosecutor's
office
they
were
handled
with
a
grand
jury
that's
how
they
were
all
handled
across
our
state
i
now
believe
it
is
better
for
accountability
if
the
prosecutor
handles
them
and
makes
those
decisions
herself
that
aside
i
am
proud
of
the
work
our
staff
did
people
in
our
office
the
cases
that
came
to
us
the
african-american
community
that
came
to
us
they
said
there
was
no
justice
for
their
little
kids
there
was
a
kid
named
byron
phillips
that
was
shot
on
his
front
porch
no
one
had
bothered
to
figure
out
who
did
it
when
i
came
into
that
office
we
worked
with
the
community
groups
we
put
up
billboards
we
found
the
shooter
and
we
put
him
in
jail
we
did
the
same
for
the
killer
of
a
little
girl
named
tyesha
edwards
who
was
doing
her
homework
at
her
kitchen
table
and
was
shot
through
the
window
what
changes
did
we
make
go
after
white-collar
crimes
in
a
big
way
diversity
the
office
in
a
big
way
work
with
the
innocence
project
to
make
sure
we
do
much
better
with
eyewitness
id
and
as
a
senator
and
as
your
president
i
will
make
sure
that
we
don't
just
do
the
first
step
act
when
it
comes
to
criminal
sentencing
that
we
move
to
the
second
step
act
which
means
the
percent
of
people
that
are
incarcerated
in
local
and
state
jails
let's
reduce
those
sentences
for
nonviolent
offenders
and
let's
get
them
jobs
and
let
them
vote
when
they
get
out
of
prison
applause
davis
thank
you
senator
klobuchar
you
all
believe
that
the
war
on
drugs
has
put
too
many
americans
behind
bars
vice
president
biden
you
have
a
plan
to
release
many
nonviolent
drug
offenders
from
prison
senator
booker
says
that
your
plan
is
not
ambitious
enough
your
response
biden
well
first
of
all
let
me
say
that
when
i
came
back
from
law
school
i
had
a
job
with
a
great
a
big-time
law
firm
i
left
and
became
a
public
defender
because
my
state
was
under
siege
when
dr
king
was
assassinated
we
were
occupied
by
the
national
guard
for
months
i've
been
involved
from
the
beginning
as
a
young
congressman
as
a
young
councilman
i
introduced
legislation
to
try
to
keep
them
from
putting
a
sewer
plant
in
a
poor
neighborhood
i
made
sure
that
we
dealt
with
redlining
banks
should
have
to
lend
where
they
operate
et
cetera
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
what's
happened
is
that
we're
in
a
situation
now
where
there
are
so
many
people
who
are
in
jail
and
shouldn't
be
in
jail
the
whole
means
by
which
this
should
change
is
the
whole
model
has
to
change
we
should
be
talking
about
rehabilitation
nobody
should
be
in
jail
for
a
nonviolent
crime
as
when
we
were
in
the
white
house
we
released
people
from
the
federal
prison
system
nobody
should
be
in
jail
for
a
drug
problem
they
should
be
going
directly
to
a
rehabilitation
we
build
more
rehabilitation
centers
not
prisons
applause
we
i'm
the
guy
that
put
in
the
drug
courts
to
divert
people
from
the
criminal
justice
system
and
so
we
have
to
change
the
whole
way
we
look
at
this
when
we
put
people
in
prison
we
have
to
equip
them
that
when
they
get
out
nobody
who
got
in
prison
for
marijuana
for
example
immediately
upon
being
released
they
shouldn't
be
in
there
that
should
be
a
misdemeanor
they
should
be
out
and
their
record
should
be
expunged
every
single
right
should
be
returned
when
you
finish
your
term
in
prison
you
should
be
able
not
only
to
vote
but
have
access
to
pell
grants
have
access
to
be
able
to
get
housing
applause
have
access
to
be
able
to
move
along
the
way
i've
laid
out
a
detailed
plan
along
those
lines
and
the
fact
is
we've
learned
so
much
more
more
davis
thank
you
mr
vice
president
biden
thank
you
davis
senator
booker
seconds
to
respond
booker
our
criminal
justice
system
is
so
savagely
broken
there's
no
difference
in
america
between
blacks
whites
and
latinos
for
using
drugs
or
dealing
drugs
but
if
you
are
african-american
you
are
almost
four
times
more
likely
to
be
arrested
and
incarcerated
destroying
your
lives
and
so
much
of
this
comes
down
to
privilege
we
have
a
criminal
justice
system
that
brian
stephenson
ph
says
treats
you
better
if
you're
rich
and
guilty
than
if
you're
poor
and
innocent
and
so
i
have
challenged
this
whole
field
we
can
specifically
and
demonstrably
now
show
that
there
are
people
unjustly
incarcerated
in
america
and
all
of
us
should
come
forward
and
say
when
we
are
president
of
the
united
states
when
i
am
president
of
the
united
states
we
will
release
them
and
let
me
be
specific
i
joined
together
and
led
in
the
united
states
senate
the
only
major
bipartisan
bill
to
pass
under
this
president
for
criminal
justice
reform
that
has
already
led
to
thousands
of
people
coming
out
of
jail
if
members
of
the
united
states
senate
says
that
these
sentences
are
way
too
long
and
we
changed
it
but
we
didn't
make
it
retroactive
we
could
literally
point
to
the
people
that
are
in
jail
unjustly
right
now
everyone
on
this
stage
should
say
that
we
are
going
to
give
clemency
to
these
people
and
i
challenge
you
don't
just
say
a
big
statement
back
it
up
with
details
of
the
people
in
prison
right
now
looking
for
one
of
the
most
sacrosanct
ideals
of
this
nation
which
is
liberty
and
freedom
we
need
to
reform
this
system
and
we
must
do
it
now
every
day
we
wait
is
too
long
davis
thank
you
senator
booker
applause
david
muir
thank
you
linsey
i
want
to
turn
to
the
deadly
mass
shootings
here
in
this
country
and
of
course
we
are
all
mindful
tonight
of
where
we
stand
we
are
here
in
texas
tonight
where
people
have
lost
their
lives
in
just
the
last
month
alone
el
paso
which
we've
discussed
in
odessa
and
i
know
there
are
survivors
from
el
paso
right
here
in
the
hall
tonight
vice
president
biden
i
do
want
to
direct
this
to
you
because
we
all
remember
sandy
hook
twenty-six
people
died
in
that
school
of
them
children
those
first
graders
would
be
in
eighth
grade
today
muir
at
the
time
there
was
a
groundswell
in
this
country
to
get
something
done
president
obama
asked
you
to
lead
the
push
for
gun
control
you
have
often
pointed
to
your
ability
to
reach
across
the
aisle
to
get
things
done
but
four
months
after
sandy
hook
a
measure
to
require
expanded
background
checks
died
on
the
senate
floor
if
you
couldn't
get
it
done
after
sandy
hook
why
should
voters
give
you
another
chance
biden
because
i
got
it
done
before
i'm
the
only
one
up
here
that's
ever
beat
the
nra
only
one
ever
to
beat
the
nra
nationally
i'm
the
guy
that
brought
the
brady
bill
into
into
focus
and
became
law
and
so
that's
number
one
number
two
after
sandy
hook
a
number
of
things
happened
it
went
from
a
cause
to
a
movement
look
what's
happened
now
mothers
the
organization
mothers
against
violence
gun
violence
we've
seen
what's
happened
again
now
we
have
all
these
young
people
marching
on
washington
making
sure
that
things
are
going
to
change
there
has
been
a
sea
change
those
proposals
i
put
forward
for
the
president
had
over
percent
of
gun
of
gun
of
members
of
the
nra
supporting
them
and
overwhelmingly
the
rest
of
the
people
supporting
them
now
the
numbers
are
much
higher
because
they
realize
what
i've
been
saying
and
we've
all
been
saying
is
correct
over
of
the
american
people
think
we
have
to
get
assault
weapons
off
the
street
period
and
we
have
to
get
buy-backs
and
get
them
out
of
their
basements
applause
so
the
point
is
things
have
changed
and
things
have
changed
a
lot
and
now
what's
happening
is
and
by
the
way
the
way
beto
handled
excuse
me
for
saying
beto
what
the
congressman
o'rourke
that's
all
right
beto's
good
applause
biden
the
way
he
handled
what
happened
in
his
hometown
is
meaningful
to
look
in
the
eyes
of
those
people
to
see
those
kids
applause
to
understand
those
parents
you
understand
the
heartache
unknown
but
this
is
the
problem
biden
we
are
ready
to
do
this
applause
muir
mr
vice
president
unknown
this
is
the
problem
o'rourke
thank
you
applause
muir
you
did
bring
up
assault
weapons
here
applause
you
did
bring
up
assault
weapons
here
and
many
of
you
on
this
stage
have
talked
about
executive
order
senator
harris
you
have
said
that
you
would
take
executive
action
on
guns
within
your
first
days
harris
correct
muir
including
banning
imports
of
ar-
assault
weapons
harris
that's
right
muir
president
obama
after
sandy
hook
more
than
executive
actions
and
yet
here
we
all
are
today
in
recent
days
former
vice
president
biden
has
said
about
executive
orders
some
really
talented
people
are
seeking
the
nomination
they
said
i'm
going
to
issue
an
executive
order
biden
saying
there's
no
constitutional
authority
to
issue
that
executive
order
when
they
say
i'm
going
to
eliminate
assault
weapons
saying
you
can't
do
it
by
executive
order
any
more
than
trump
can
do
things
when
he
says
he
can
do
it
by
executive
order
does
the
vice
president
have
a
point
there
biden
some
things
you
can
many
things
you
can't
muir
let's
let
the
senator
answer
harris
well
i
mean
i
would
just
say
hey
joe
instead
of
saying
no
we
can't
let's
say
yes
we
can
laughter
applause
biden
let's
be
constitutional
we've
got
a
constitution
harris
and
yes
we
can
because
i'll
tell
you
something
the
way
that
i
think
about
this
is
i've
seen
more
autopsy
photographs
than
i
care
to
tell
you
i
have
attended
more
police
officer
funerals
than
i
care
to
tell
you
i
have
hugged
more
mothers
of
homicide
victims
than
i
care
to
tell
you
and
the
idea
that
we
would
wait
for
this
congress
which
has
just
done
nothing
to
act
is
just
it
is
overlooking
the
fact
that
every
day
in
america
our
babies
are
going
to
school
to
have
drills
elementary
middle
and
high
school
students
where
they
are
learning
about
how
they
have
to
hide
in
a
closet
or
crouch
in
a
corner
if
there
is
a
mass
shooter
roaming
the
hallways
of
their
school
i
was
talking
about
this
at
one
of
my
town
halls
and
and
this
child
who
was
eight
years
old
probably
came
up
to
me
it
was
like
it
was
a
secret
between
the
two
of
us
and
he
tugged
on
my
jacket
and
he
said
i
had
to
have
one
of
those
drills
it
is
traumatizing
our
children
el
paso
and
beto
god
love
you
for
standing
so
courageously
in
the
midst
of
that
tragedy
you
know
people
asked
me
applause
in
el
paso
they
said
you
know
because
i
have
a
long-standing
record
on
this
issue
they
said
well
do
you
think
trump
is
responsible
for
what
happened
and
i
said
well
look
i
mean
obviously
he
didn't
pull
the
trigger
but
he's
certainly
been

you
vice
president
biden

you
still
stand
by
what
you
said
on
an
executive
order
biden
no
what
i
said
was
the
question
speak
to
constitutional
scholars
if
in
fact
we
could
say
by
the
way
you
can't
own
the
following
weapons
period
they
cannot
be
sold
anymore
check
with
constitutional
scholars
now
you
can
say
muir
mr
vice
president
thank
you
congressman
o'rourke
i
want
to
get
to
you
on
this
crosstalk
harris
john
could
i
tell
you
what
you
could
do
in
days
muir
i'm
going
to
i'm
going
to
work
down
the
row
here
but
i
do
want
to
come
to
congressman
o'rourke
because
i
know
this
is
personal
to
you
el
paso
is
your
hometown
some
on
this
stage
have
suggested
a
voluntary
buy-back
for
guns
in
this
country
you've
gone
further
you've
said
quote
americans
who
own
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
will
have
to
sell
them
to
the
government
all
of
them
you
know
that
critics
call
this
confiscation
are
you
proposing
taking
away
their
guns
and
how
would
this
work
o'rourke
i
am
if
it's
a
weapon
that
was
designed
to
kill
people
on
a
battlefield
applause
if
the
high
impact
high
velocity
round
when
it
hits
your
body
shreds
everything
inside
of
your
body
because
it
was
designed
to
do
that
so
that
you
would
bleed
to
death
on
a
battlefield
and
not
be
able
to
get
up
and
kill
one
of
our
soldiers
when
we
see
that
being
used
against
children
and
in
odessa
i
met
the
mother
of
a
year-old
girl
who
was
shot
by
an
ar-
and
that
mother
watched
her
bleed
to
death
over
the
course
of
an
hour
because
so
many
other
people
were
shot
by
that
ar-
in
odessa
and
midland
there
weren't
enough
ambulances
to
get
to
them
in
time
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
applause
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
applause
muir
congressman
thank
you
o'rourke
and
i
want
to
say
this
i'm
listening
to
the
people
of
this
country
the
day
after
i
proposed
doing
that
i
went
to
a
gun
show
in
conway
arkansas
to
meet
with
those
who
were
selling
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
and
those
who
were
buying
those
weapons
and
you
might
be
surprised
there
was
some
common
ground
there
folks
who
said
i
would
willingly
give
that
up
cut
it
to
pieces
i
don't
need
this
weapon
to
hunt
to
defend
myself
it
is
a
weapon
of
war
so
let's
do
the
right
thing
but
let's
bring
everyone
in
america
into
the
conversation
republicans
democrats
gun-owners
and
non-gun
owners
alike
unknown
may
i
make
a
point
muir
congressman
thank
you
i
want
to
bring
in
senator
klobuchar
on
this
because
you've
often
talked
about
your
uncle
and
the
proud
hunters
back
home
in
minnesota
so
i
wanted
to
get
your
response
to
congressman
o'rourke
tonight
where
do
you
stand
on
mandatory
gun
buybacks
klobuchar
i
so
appreciate
what
the
congressman's
been
doing
and
i
want
to
remind
people
here
that
what
unites
us
is
so
much
bigger
than
what
divides
us
everyone
up
here
favors
an
assault
weapon
ban
everyone
up
here
favors
magazine
limitations
which
by
the
way
would
have
made
a
huge
difference
if
that
was
in
place
in
el
paso
in
that
store
where
all
those
ordinary
people
showed
such
extraordinary
courage
and
certainly
in
dayton
ohio
where
in
seconds
one
man
guns
down
innocent
people
the
cops
got
there
in
one
minute
and
it
still
wasn't
enough
to
save
those
people
that's
what
unites
us
you
know
what
else
unites
us
and
i'll
tell
you
this
what
unites
us
is
that
right
now
on
mitch
mcconnell's
desk
are
three
bills
universal
background
checks
closing
the
charleston
loophole
and
passing
my
bill
to
make
sure
that
domestic
abusers
don't
get
ak-
s
applause
muir
senator
klobuchar
klobuchar
so
if
we
want
to
get
something
done
and
i
personally
think
we
should
start
with
a
voluntary
buyback
program
that's
what
i
think
david
but
i
want
to
finish
this
because
if
you
want
action
now
if
you
want
action
now
we
got
to
send
a
message
to
mitch
mcconnell
we
can't
wait
until
one
of
us
gets
in
the
white
house
we
have
to
pass
those
bills
right
now
to
get
this
done
muir
senator
klobuchar
klobuchar
because
we
cannot
spare
another
innocent
life
muir
thank
you
thank
you
i
want
to
turn
to
senator
booker
because
you
have
said
just
this
week
about
guns
and
about
the
candidates
on
this
stage
that
the
differences
do
matter
those
were
your
words
you
have
argued
if
you
need
a
license
to
drive
a
car
in
this
country
you
should
have
a
license
to
buy
a
gun
gun-owners
would
not
only
have
to
pass
a
background
check
they
would
have
to
obtain
a
federal
license
to
buy
a
gun
this
would
require
as
you
know
congress
to
pass
legislation
if
democrats
can't
get
universal
background
checks
how
would
you
get
this
done
and
can
you
name
one
republican
colleague
of
yours
in
the
senate
right
now
who
would
be
onboard
with
this
idea
booker
so
background
checks
and
gun
licensing
these
are
agreed
to
by
overwhelmingly
the
majority
of
americans
eighty-three
percent
of
americans
agree
with
licensing
this
is
the
issue
look
i
grew
up
in
the
suburbs
it
was
about
years
ago
that
i
came
out
of
my
home
when
i
moved
to
inner
city
newark
new
jersey
and
witnessed
the
aftermath
of
a
shooting
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
shooting
after
shooting
after
shooting
in
neighborhoods
like
mine
for
decades
this
has
been
a
crisis
for
me
it's
why
i
was
the
first
person
to
come
out
for
gun
licensing
and
i'm
happy
that
people
like
beto
o'rourke
are
showing
such
courage
now
and
coming
forward
and
also
now
supporting
licensing
but
this
is
what
i'm
sorry
about
i'm
sorry
that
it
had
to
take
issues
coming
to
my
neighborhood
or
personally
affecting
beto
to
suddenly
make
us
demand
change
this
is
a
crisis
of
empathy
in
our
nation
we
are
never
going
to
solve
this
crisis
if
we
have
to
wait
for
it
to
personally
affect
us
or
our
neighborhood
or
our
community
before
we
demand
action
you
want
to
know
how
we
get
this
done
we
get
this
done
by
having
a
more
courageous
empathy
where
people
don't
wait
for
this
hell
to
visit
upon
their
communities
they
stand
up
and
understand
the
truth
of
what
king
said
that
injustice
anywhere
is
a
threat
to
justice
everywhere
i
will
lead
change
on
this
issue
because
i
have
seen
what
the
carnage
creates
in
communities
like
mine
because
we
forget
national
shootings
these
mass
shootings
are
tragedies
but
the
majority
of
the
homicide
victims
come
from
neighborhoods
like
mine
nobody
has
ascended
to
the
white
house
that
will
bring
more
personal
passion
on
this
issue
i
will
fight
this
and
bring
a
fight
to
the
nra
and
the
corporate
gun
lobby
like
they
have
never
seen
before
applause
muir
senator
booker
thank
you
a
quick
follow-up
though
because
americans
watching
tonight
know
the
reality
of
congress
in
washington
i
asked
do
you
have
a
republican
colleague
in
the
senate
who
would
be
onboard
with
this
idea
to
get
this
done
booker
you
know
if
that
was
the
attitude
when
strom
thurmond
had
the
longest
filibuster
ever
on
civil
rights
if
it
was
this
idea
that
we
can't
get
it
done
because
of
the
situation
in
the
senate
i'm
looking
to
lead
a
movement
the
number-one
reason
why
governments
are
formed
is
to
protect
the
citizenry
think
about
this
we
have
had
more
people
die
due
to
gun
violence
in
my
lifetime
than
every
single
war
in
this
country
combined
from
the
revolutionary
war
until
now
this
is
not
a
side
issue
to
me
it
is
a
central
issue
to
me
that
is
the
kind
of
fight
because
the
majority
of
homicide
victims
we
have
a
mass
shooting
every
single
day
in
communities
like
mine
we
must
awaken
a
more
courageous
empathy
in
this
country
so
that
we
stand
together
and
fight
together
and
overwhelm
those
republicans
who
are
not
even
representing
their
constituency
because
the
majority
of
americans
the
majority
of
gun-owners
agree
with
me
not
the
corporate
gun
lobby
it
is
time
for
a
movement
on
this
issue
and
i
will
lead
it
applause
biden
go
beat
them
ph
muir
senator
booker
thank
you
senator
warren
i
want
to
come
to
you
next
because
you
have
actually
said
in
recent
days
that
there
are
things
you
can
get
done
with
republicans
in
the
senate
what
can
you
get
done
on
gun
control
warren
so
let's
start
by
framing
the
problem
the
right
way
we
have
a
gun
violence
problem
in
this
country
the
mass
shootings
are
terrible
but
they
get
all
the
headlines
children
die
every
day
on
streets
in
neighborhoods
on
playgrounds
people
die
from
violence
from
suicide
and
domestic
abuse
we
have
a
gun
violence
problem
in
this
country
and
we
agree
on
many
steps
we
could
take
to
fix
it
my
view
on
this
is
we're
going
to
it's
not
going
to
be
one
and
done
on
this
we're
going
to
do
it
and
we're
going
to
have
to
do
it
again
and
we're
going
to
have
to
come
back
some
more
until
we
cut
the
number
of
gun
deaths
in
this
country
significantly
but
here's
the
deal
the
question
we
need
to
ask
is
when
we've
got
this
much
support
across
the
country
percent
of
americans
want
to
see
us
do
i
like
registration
want
to
see
us
do
background
checks
want
to
get
assault
weapons
off
the
streets
why
doesn't
it
happen
and
the
answer
is
corruption
pure
and
simple
applause
we
have
a
congress
that
is
beholden
to
the
gun
industry
and
unless
we're
willing
to
address
that
head-on
and
roll
back
the
filibuster
we're
not
going
to
get
anything
done
on
guns
i
was
in
the
united
states
senate
when
senators
said
let's
do
background
checks
let's
get
rid
of
assault
weapons
and
with
senators
it
failed
because
of
the
filibuster
until
we
attack
the
systemic
problems
we
can't
get
gun
reform
in
this
country
we've
got
to
go
straight
against
the
industry
and
we've
got
to
change
congress
so
it
doesn't
just
work
for
the
wealthy
and
well-connected
so
it
works
for
the
people
applause
muir
senator
warren
thank
you
you
bring
up
eliminating
the
filibuster
which
means
you
would
need
simply
a
simple
majority
in
a
republican
senate
to
get
something
done
i
want
to
turn
to
senator
sanders
on
this
because
you've
said
before
of
this
if
donald
trump
supports
ending
the
filibuster
which
he's
talked
about
himself
you
should
be
nervous
would
you
support
ending
the
filibuster
sanders
no
but
what
i
would
support
absolutely
is
passing
major
legislation
the
gun
legislation
the
people
here
are
talking
about
medicare
for
all
climate
change
legislation
that
saves
the
planet
i
will
not
wait
for
votes
to
make
that
happen
and
you
can
do
it
in
a
variety
of
ways
you
can
do
that
through
budget
reconciliation
law
you
have
a
vice
president
who
will
in
fact
tell
the
senate
what
is
appropriate
and
what
is
not
what
is
in
order
and
what
is
not
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
a
point
that
elizabeth
made
and
that
in
fact
in
terms
of
gun
issues
picking
up
on
cory
and
beto
and
everybody
else
what
we
are
looking
at
is
a
corrupt
political
system
and
that
means
whether
it
is
the
drug
companies
or
the
insurance
companies
or
the
fossil
fuel
industry
determining
what's
happening
in
washington
or
in
this
case
you've
got
an
nra
which
has
intimidated
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
republican
leadership
applause
i
am
proud
i
am
proud
that
year
after
year
i
had
an
f
rating
from
the
nra
and
as
president
i
will
not
be
intimidated
by
the
nra
muir
senator
sanders
thank
you
harris
may
i
respond
ramos
we've
been
hearing
a
lot
about
what's
been
happening
here
in
texas
only
a
few
weeks
ago
the
deadliest
massacre
of
latinos
latinos
in
modern
u.s.
history
happened
in
this
state
in
el
paso
so
the
fear
among
latinos
and
you
know
this
is
very
real
so
let
me
start
with
an
issue
that
is
causing
a
lot
of
division
in
this
country
immigration
vice
president
biden
as
a
presidential
candidate
in
you
supported
the
border
wall
saying
unlike
most
democrats
i
voted
for
miles
of
fence
this
is
what
you
said
then
you
served
as
vice
president
in
an
administration
that
deported
million
people
the
most
ever
in
u.s.
history
did
you
do
anything
to
prevent
those
deportations
i
mean
you've
been
asked
this
question
before
and
refused
to
answer
so
let
me
try
once
again
are
you
prepared
to
say
tonight
that
you
and
president
obama
made
a
mistake
about
deportations
why
should
latinos
trust
you
biden
what
latinos
should
look
at
is
comparing
this
president
to
the
president
we
have
is
outrageous
number
one
we
didn't
lock
people
up
in
cages
we
didn't
separate
families
we
didn't
do
all
of
those
things
number
one
number
two
number
two
by
the
time
this
is
a
president
who
came
along
with
the
daca
program
no
one
had
ever
done
that
before
this
is
the
president
that
sent
legislation
to
the
desk
saying
he
wants
to
find
a
pathway
for
the
million
undocumented
in
the
united
states
of
america
this
is
a
president
who's
done
a
great
deal
so
i'm
proud
to
have
served
with
him
what
i
would
do
as
president
is
several
more
things
because
things
have
changed
i
would
in
fact
make
sure
that
there
is
we
immediately
surge
to
the
border
all
those
people
who
are
seeking
asylum
they
deserve
to
be
heard
that's
who
we
are
we're
a
nation
who
says
if
you
want
to
flee
and
you're
freeing
oppression
you
should
come
i
would
change
the
order
that
the
president
just
changed
saying
women
who
were
being
beaten
and
abused
could
no
longer
claim
that
as
a
reason
for
asylum
and
by
the
way
retrospectively
you
know
the
th
anniversary
of
the
violence
against
women
act
is
up
the
republican
congress
has
not
reauthorized
it
let's
put
pressure
on
them
to
pass
the
violence
against
women
act
now
inaudible
back
ramos
yeah
but
you
didn't
answer
the
question
biden
well
i
did
answer
the
question
ramos
no
did
you
make
a
mistake
with
those
deportations
biden
the
president
did
the
best
thing
that
was
able
to
be
done
at
the
time
ramos
how
about
you
biden
i'm
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
ramos
secretary
castro
would
you
want
to
respond
to
vice
president
biden
castro
i
mean
look
ramos
and
let
me
put
this
in
context
because
your
party
controlled
the
white
house
and
congress
in
and
didn't
pass
immigration
reform
and
this
broke
a
promise
made
by
president
barack
obama
to
latinos
so
why
should
voters
trust
democrats
now
i
mean
now
it
is
even
more
difficult
as
you
know
because
you
need
republican
votes
in
the
senate
so
are
you
willing
for
instance
to
give
up
daca
or
give
up
a
path
to
citizenship
or
even
agree
to
build
a
wall
in
order
to
legalize
million
undocumented
immigrants
castro
jorge
thank
you
very
much
for
that
question
and
look
i
agree
that
barack
obama
was
very
different
from
donald
trump
donald
trump
has
a
dark
heart
when
it
comes
to
immigrants
he
built
his
whole
political
career
so
far
on
scapegoating
and
fearmongering
and
otherizing
migrants
and
that's
very
different
from
barack
obama
but
my
problem
with
vice
president
biden
and
cory
pointed
this
out
last
time
is
every
time
something
good
about
barack
obama
comes
up
he
says
oh
i
was
there
i
was
there
i
was
there
that's
me
too
and
then
every
time
somebody
questions
part
of
the
administration
that
we
were
both
part
of
he
says
well
that
was
the
president
i
mean
he
wants
to
take
credit
for
obama's
work
but
not
have
to
answer
to
any
questions
i
mean
applause

that's
not
what
i
said

biden
that's
not
what
i
said
castro
jorge
let
me
just
say
that
i
would
i
was
the
first
candidate
in
early
april
to
put
forward
an
immigration
plan
you
know
why
because
i'm
not
afraid
of
donald
trump
on
this
issue
i'm
not
going
to
back
pedal
i'm
not
going
to
pretend
like
i
don't
have
my
own
vision
for
immigration
so
we're
not
going
to
give
up
daca
we're
not
going
to
give
up
protections
for
anybody
i
believe
that
on
january
we're
going
to
have
a
democratic
president
we're
going
to
throw
out
mitch
mcconnell
and
john
cornyn
and
have
a
democratic
senate
and
a
democratic
house
and
we're
going
to
pass
immigration
reform
within
the
first
days

ramos
ok
senator
warren
hundreds
of
children
have
been
separated
from
their
parents
at
the
border
and
recently
in
mississippi
we
saw
the
largest
immigration
raid
in
a
decade
you
want
ice
the
agency
in
charge
of
rounding
up
undocumented
immigrants
so
how
would
you
deal
with
the
millions
of
immigrants
who
arrive
legally
but
overstay
their
visas
and
how
would
you
stop
hundreds
of
thousands
of
central
americans
who
want
to
migrate
to
the
u.s.
warren
well
i
start
with
a
statement
of
principles
and
that
is
in
this
country
immigration
does
not
make
us
weaker
immigration
makes
us
stronger
applause
i
want
to
see
us
expand
legal
immigration
and
create
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
our
dreamers
but
also
for
their
grandparents
and
for
their
cousins
for
people
who
have
overstayed
student
visas
and
for
people
who
came
here
to
work
in
the
fields
i
want
to
have
a
system
that
is
a
path
to
citizenship
that
is
fair
and
achievable
down
at
the
border
we've
got
to
rework
this
entirely
a
system
right
now
that
cannot
tell
the
difference
in
the
threat
posed
by
a
terrorist
a
criminal
and
a
year-old
girl
is
not
a
system
that
is
keeping
us
safer
and
it
is
not
serving
our
values
applause
ramos
mr
yang
warren
we
need
i
want
to
add
one
more
part
on
this
because
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
all
the
pieces
why
do
we
have
a
crisis
at
the
border
in
no
small
part
because
we
have
withdrawn
help
from
people
in
central
america
who
are
suffering
applause
we
need
to
restore
that
help
we
need
to
help
establish
and
re-establish
the
rule
of
law
so
that
people
don't
feel
like
they
have
to
flee
for
their
lives
we
have
a
crisis
that
donald
trump
has
created
and
hopes
to
profit
from
politically
we
have
to
have
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
fight
back
applause
ramos
mr
yang
it
is
true
that
in
the
last
few
years
we
have
seen
the
most
severe
anti-immigrant
measures
from
putting
kids
in
cages
to
limiting
asylum
for
people
fleeing
gangs
and
domestic
violence
but
it
is
also
true
about
million
immigrants
enter
the
u.s.
legally
every
year
so
are
you
willing
to
raise
the
number
of
legal
immigrants
from
million
to
million
per
year
and
should
there
be
a
merit
system
as
president
trump
wants
warren
so
yes
oh
i'm
sorry
did
you
me
or
yang
it
was
me
warren
oh
he
said
it
ok
sorry
yang
my
my
father
grew
up
on
a
peanut
farm
in
asia
with
no
floor
and
now
his
son
is
running
for
president
that
is
the
immigration
story
that
we
have
applause
to
be
able
to
share
with
the
american
people
if
you
look
at
our
history
almost
half
of
fortune
companies
were
founded
by
either
immigrants
or
children
of
immigrants
and
rates
of
business
formation
are
much
higher
in
immigrant
communities
we
have
to
say
to
the
american
people
immigrants
are
positive
for
our
economic
and
social
dynamism
and
i
would
return
the
level
of
legal
immigration
to
the
point
it
was
under
the
obama-biden
administration
i
think
we
have
to
compete
for
talent
and
i
am
the
opposite
of
donald
trump
in
many
ways
he
says
build
a
wall
i'm
going
to
say
to
immigrants
come
to
america
because
if
you
come
here
your
son
our
daughter
can
run
for
president
the
water
is
great
and
this
is
where
you
want
to
build
a
company
build
a
family
and
build
a
life
this
country
has
been
a
magnet
for
human
capital
for
generations
if
we
lose
that
we
lose
something
integral
to
our
continued
success
and
that
is
where
i
would
lead
as
president

to

has
called
mexican

rapists

you

are

anyone
who
supports
this
is
supporting

applause
speaking

the
only
people
though
who
actually
buy
into
this
president's
hateful
rhetoric
around
immigrants
are
people
who
don't
know
any
we
have
an
opportunity
to
build
an
american
majority
around
immigration
reform
in
my
community
a
group
of
conservative
republicans
rallied
around
an
individual
a
beloved
local
individual
who
was
deported
when
he
went
into
ice
to
try
to
get
his
paperwork
sorted
out
because
they
never
thought
it
would
happen
to
him
in
some
of
the
most
conservative
rural
areas
of
iowa
i
have
seen
communities
that
embraced
immigration
grow
and
that's
why
part
of
my
plan
for
revitalizing
the
economies
of
rural
america
includes
community
renewal
visas
that
would
allow
cities
and
towns
and
counties
that
are
hurting
not
only
for
jobs
but
for
population
to
embrace
immigration
as
we
have
in
my
city
you
know
the
only
reason
that
south
bend
is
growing
right
now
after
years
of
shrinking
is
immigration
it's
one
of
the
reasons
we
acted
not
waiting
for
washington
to
create
city-issued
municipal
ids
so
that
people
regardless
of
immigration
status
in
our
city
had
the
opportunity
to
have
the
benefits
of
identification
we
have
an
opportunity
to
actually
get
something
done
but
we
cannot
allow
this
continue
to
be
the
same
debate
with
the
same
arguments
and
the
same
clever
lines
often
among
the
same
people
since
the
last
real
reform
happened
in
the
s
we
have
to
actually
engage
the
american
majority
around
the
opportunities
for
not
just
growth
in
small
communities
but
our
values
values
of
welcome
values
of
faith
that
all
argue
for
us
to
manage
this
humanely
and
in
a
way
that
marries
our
values
with
our
laws
ramos
speaking
spanish
in
an
interview
eight
months
ago
you
were
asked
to
asked
what
to
do
with
the
so-called
over-stayers
people
who
come
with
a
visa
and
then
stay
and
you
said
i
don't
know
do
you
have
an
answer
now
o'rourke
i
do
and
if
you
read
the
rest
of
that
article
in
the
washington
post
i
talked
about
harmonizing
our
entry
exit
system
with
mexico
in
the
same
way
that
we
do
with
canada
i
think
that
could
help
us
to
keep
a
handle
on
visa
over-stays
but
i
think
the
larger
question
that
we're
trying
to
get
at
is
how
do
we
rewrite
this
country's
immigration
laws
in
our
own
image
in
the
image
of
houston
texas
the
most
diverse
city
in
the
united
states
of
america
applause
in
the
image
of
el
paso
texas
one
of
the
safest
cities
in
the
united
states
of
america
safe
not
despite
the
fact
that
we
are
a
city
of
immigrants
safe
because
we
are
a
city
of
immigrants
speaking
spanish
applause
i
will
lead
an
effort
to
make
sure
that
we
rewrite
our
immigration
laws
in
that
way
never
cage
another
child
make
sure
that
there
is
accountability
and
justice
for
the
seven
lives
lost
under
our
care
and
our
custody
but
also
face
the
fact
that
democrats
and
republicans
alike
voted
to
build
a
wall
that
has
produced
thousands
of
deaths
of
people
trying
to
cross
to
join
family
or
to
work
a
job
that
we
have
been
part
of
deporting
people
hundreds
of
thousands
just
in
the
obama
administration
alone
who
posed
no
threat
to
this
country
breaking
up
their
families
democrats
have
to
get
off
the
back
foot
we
have
to
lead
on
this
issue
because
we
know
it
is
right
legalize
america
begin
with
those
more
than
million
dreamers
make
them
u.s.
citizens
right
now
in
this
their
true
home
country
applause
and
extend
that
to
their
parents
their
sisters
and
their
brothers
and
ensure
that
we
have
a
legal
safe
orderly
system
to
come
to
this
country
and
add
to
our
greatness

stephanopoulos
welcome
back
we
want
to
turn
now
to
national
security
and
the
foreign
policy
issue
that
has
such
a
direct
impact
here
at
home
the
u.s.
relationship
with
china
trade
and
president
trump's
tariffs
we
received
more
than
questions
from
viewers
wanting
to
know
how
all
of
you
are
going
to
handle
these
tariffs
and
mr
yang
let
me
begin
with
you
would
you
repeal
the
tariffs
on
your
first
day
in
office
and
if
so
would
you
risk
losing
leverage
in
our
trade
relationship
with
china
yang
i
would
not
repeal
the
tariffs
on
day
one
but
i
would
let
the
chinese
know
that
we
need
to
hammer
out
a
deal
because
right
now
the
tariffs
are
pummeling
producers
and
farmers
in
iowa
who
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
imbalances
that
we
have
with
china
a
ceo
friend
of
mine
was
in
china
recently
and
he
said
that
he
saw
pirated
u.s.
intellectual
property
on
worker
workstations
to
the
tune
of
thousands
of
dollars
per
head
and
he
said
one
how
can
my
workers
compete
against
that
and
two
think
about
all
the
lost
revenue
to
american
companies
so
the
imbalances
are
real
but
we
have
to
let
the
chinese
know
that
we
recognize
that
president
trump
has
pursued
an
arbitrary
and
haphazard
trade
policy
that
has
had
victims
on
both
sides
so
no
to
repealing
the
tariffs
immediately
but
yes
to
making
sure
we
come
to
a
deal
that
addresses
the
concerns
of
american
companies
and
american
producers
stephanopoulos
mayor
pete
let
me
take
that
question
let
me
take
that
question
to
you
because
you've
seen
president
trump's
tweets
he
says
what's
going
to
happen
here
is
the
chinese
are
just
going
to
wait
him
out
so
that
they
can
get
a
democrat
who
they
can
take
advantage
of
how
do
you
think
about
china
we've
seen
president
trump
call
president
xi
both
an
enemy
and
a
friend
buttigieg
well
the
president
clearly
has
no
strategy
you
know
when
i
first
got
into
this
race
i
remember
president
trump
scoffed
and
said
he'd
like
to
see
me
making
a
deal
with
xi
jinping
i'd
like
to
see
him
making
a
deal
with
xi
jinping
laughter
is
it
just
me
or
was
that
supposed
to
happen
in
like
april
it's
one
more
example
of
a
commitment
not
made
when
that
happens
on
the
international
stage
people
take
note
not
just
our
competitors
our
adversaries
but
also
our
allies
take
note
of
the
inability
of
the
united
states
to
keep
its
word
or
follow
through
on
its
plans
and
when
that
happens
there
are
serious
consequences
we
saw
it
at
the
g
the
leaders
of
some
of
the
greatest
powers
and
economies
of
the
world
sitting
to
talk
about
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
in
the
world
climate
change
and
there
was
literally
an
empty
chair
where
american
leadership
could
have
been
the
problem
is
this
is
a
moment
when
american
leadership
is
needed
more
than
ever
whether
it's
in
hong
kong
where
those
protesters
for
democracy
need
to
know
that
they
have
a
friend
in
the
united
states
or
anywhere
around
the
world
where
increasingly
we
see
dictators
throwing
their
weight
around
the
world
needs
america
but
it
can't
be
just
any
america
stephanopoulos
would
you
repeal
the
tariffs
buttigieg
i
would
have
a
strategy
that
would
include
the
tariffs
as
leverage
but
it's
not
about
the
tariffs
look
what's
going
on
right
now
is
a
president
who
has
reduced
the
entire
china
challenge
into
a
question
of
tariffs
when
what
we
know
is
that
the
tariffs
are
coming
down
on
us
more
than
anybody
else
and
there's
a
lack
of
a
bigger
strategy
stephanopoulos
senator
klobuchar
you've
actually
supported
the
tariffs
on
steel
klobuchar
what
we've
got
right
now
though
george
it's
not
a
focused
tariff
on
steel
what
he
has
done
here
he
has
assessed
these
tariffs
on
our
allies
he
has
put
us
in
the
middle
of
this
trade
war
and
he
is
treating
our
farmers
and
our
workers
like
poker
chips
in
one
of
his
bankrupt
casinos
and
if
we
are
not
careful
he
is
going
to
bankrupt
this
country
one
forecast
recently
says
that
it
has
already
cost
us
jobs
all
right
there
is
soybeans
that
are
mounting
up
in
bins
all
over
the
midwest
in
my
state
of
minnesota
and
in
iowa
so
what
i
think
we
need
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
the
negotiating
table
that's
what
i
would
do
i
wouldn't
have
put
all
these
tariffs
in
place
and
i
wouldn't
have
had
a
trade
policy
where
on
august
st
he
announces
he's
going
to
have
tariffs
on
billion
of
goods
on
august
th
he
cuts
it
in
half
a
week
later
he
says
he's
going
to
reduce
taxes
the
day
after
that
he
says
he's
going
to
do
it
the
leaders
of
the
world
are
watching
this
and
it
undermines
our
strength
as
a
nation
and
yes
we
want
fair
trade
but
we
must
work
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
he
has
made
a
mockery
of
focused
trade
policy
which
i
think
means
enforcement
like
we've
done
in
northern
minnesota
passing
bills
getting
president
obama
to
do
more
on
that
so
that
our
workers
can
benefit
so
we
are
importing
exporting
goods
and
making
sure
that
it's
a
competitive
policy
where
our
goal
is
that
we
are
making
things
inventing
things
and
exporting
to
the
world
he
is
defeating
that
goal
stephanopoulos
secretary
castro
you
actually
in
one
of
the
previous
debates
identified
china
as
the
most
serious
national
security
threat
to
our
country
i
want
to
pick
up
on
what
senator
klobuchar
was
saying
she
said
she
would
go
back
to
the
negotiating
table
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
for
leverage
where
do
you
get
it
castro
well
look
i
agree
with
those
who
have
said
that
this
erratic
haphazard
trade
war
is
hurting
american
families
as
senator
klobuchar
said
american
jobs
it's
estimated
that
it's
cost
to
the
average
american
family
just
a
couple
of
days
ago
percent
of
americans
said
that
they
believe
that
we're
in
for
a
recession
next
year
so
when
i
become
president
i
would
immediately
begin
to
negotiate
with
china
to
ratchet
down
that
trade
war
we
have
leverage
there
i
also
believe
though
that
we
need
to
return
to
a
leader
when
it
comes
to
things
like
human
rights
we
have
millions
of
uighurs
for
instance
in
china
that
right
now
are
being
imprisoned
and
mistreated
applause
and
in
north
korea
this
president
is
elevating
a
dictator
we
need
to
stop
that
we
need
to
return
to
ensuring
that
america
leads
again
on
human
rights
when
it
comes
to
this
trade
war
i
would
immediately
begin
ratcheting
that
trade
war
down
we
have
leverage
in
that
discussion
stephanopoulos
senator
warren
let
me
bring
you
in
on
this
conversation
president
obama
signed
the
trans-pacific
partnership
in
part
it
was
designed
to
rein
in
china
to
bring
china
into
some
kind
of
regulation
what
do
you
think
he
got
wrong
warren
so
our
trade
policy
in
america
has
been
broken
for
decades
and
it
has
been
broken
because
it
works
for
giant
multinational
corporations
and
not
for
much
of
anyone
else
these
are
giant
corporations
that
shoot
if
they
can
save
a
nickel
by
moving
a
job
to
a
foreign
country
they'll
do
it
in
a
heartbeat
and
yet
for
decades
now
who's
been
whispering
in
the
ears
of
our
trade
negotiators
who
has
shaped
our
trade
policy
it's
been
the
giant
corporations
it's
been
their
lobbyists
and
their
executives
the
way
we
change
our
trade
policy
in
america
is
first
the
procedures
who
sits
at
the
table
i
want
to
negotiate
trade
with
unions
at
the
table
i
want
to
negotiate
it
with
small
farmers
at
the
table
i
want
to
negotiate
it
with
environmentalists
at
the
table
i
want
to
negotiate
with
human
rights
activists
at
the
table
and
you
asked
the
question
about
leverage
if
i
can
just
respond
to
that
one
the
leverage
are
you
kidding
everybody
wants
access
to
the
american
market
that
means
that
we
have
the
capacity
to
say
right
here
in
america
you
want
to
come
sell
goods
to
american
consumers
then
you
got
to
raise
your
standards
you've
got
to
raise
your
labor
standards
you've
got
to
raise
your
environmental
standards
applause
so
our
companies
can
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
we
can
use
trade
not
to
undermine
american
workers
and
not
to
undermine
american
farms
and
not
to
undermine
small
businesses
in
this
country
we
can
use
trade
to
help
build
a
stronger
economy
applause
stephanopoulos
senator
harris
how
would
your
trade
policy
differ
from
president
obama's
harris
well
first
of
all
i
have
no
criticism
of
that
more
than
just
looking
at
where
we
are
now
which
is
we've
got
a
guy
in
the
white
house
who
has
been
erratic
on
trade
policy
he
conducts
trade
policy
by
tweet
frankly
born
out
of
his
fragile
ego
it
has
resulted
in
farmers
in
iowa
with
soybeans
rotting
in
bins
looking
at
bankruptcy
when
we
look
at
this
issue
my
trade
policy
under
a
harris
administration
is
always
going
to
be
about
saying
we
need
to
export
american
products
not
american
jobs
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
have
a
meaningful
trade
policy
i
am
not
a
protectionist
democrat
look
we
need
to
sell
our
stuff
and
that
means
we
need
to
sell
it
to
people
overseas
that
means
we
need
trade
policies
that
allow
that
to
happen
you
asked
earlier
about
china
it's
a
complicated
relationship
we
have
to
hold
china
accountable
they
steal
our
products
including
our
intellectual
property
they
dump
substandard
products
into
our
economy
they
need
to
be
held
accountable
we
also
need
to
partner
with
china
on
climate
and
the
crisis
that
that
presents
we
need
to
partner
with
china
on
the
issue
of
north
korea
i
am
on
and
i
think
the
only
person
on
this
stage
the
senate
intelligence
committee
and
the
senate
homeland
security
committee
we
need
a
partner
on
the
issue
of
north
korea
but
the
bottom
line
is
this
donald
trump
in
office
on
trade
policy
you
know
he
reminds
me
of
that
guy
in
the
wizard
of
oz
you
know
when
you
pull
back
the
curtain
it's
a
really
small
dude
laughter
stephanopoulos
ok
i'm
not
even
going
to
take
the
bait
senator
harris
but
i
am
going
to
take
harris
oh
george
it
wasn't
about
you
stephanopoulos
i'm
going
to
take
this
to
senator
sanders
right
now
sanders
well
there
is
a
reason
there
is
a
reason
why
in
the
last
years
the
average
american
today
despite
an
explosion
of
technology
and
worker
productivity
is
not
making
a
penny
more
than
he
or
she
made
years
ago
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
for
decades
we
have
had
disastrous
trade
policies
i
got
to
say
to
my
good
friend
joe
biden
joe
and
i
strongly
disagree
on
trade
i
helped
lead
the
opposition
to
nafta
and
pntr
which
cost
this
country
over
million
good-paying
jobs
applause
and
what
happened
is
people
who
had
those
jobs
ended
up
getting
other
jobs
making
percent
of
what
they
made
in
manufacturing
so
trump
obviously
hasn't
a
clue
trump
thinks
that
trade
policy
is
a
tweet
at
o'clock
in
the
morning
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
develop
a
trade
policy
that
represents
workers
represents
the
farmers
in
the
midwest
and
elsewhere
who
are
losing
billions
right
now
because
of
trump's
policy
a
trade
policy
which
understands
that
if
a
company
shuts
down
in
america
and
goes
abroad
and
then
thinks
they're
going
to
get
online
to
get
a
lucrative
federal
contract
under
bernie
sanders
they
got
another
guess
coming
stephanopoulos
vice
president
biden
he
invoked
your
name
biden
yeah
well
look
we're
either
going
to
make
policy
or
china's
going
to
make
the
rules
of
the
road
we
make
up
percent
of
the
world
economy
we
need
another
percent
to
join
us
and
i
think
elizabeth
senator
warren
is
correct
at
the
table
has
to
be
labor
and
at
the
table
have
to
be
environmentalists
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
china
the
problem
isn't
the
trade
deficit
the
problem
is
they're
stealing
our
intellectual
property
the
problem
is
they're
violating
the
wto
they're
dumping
steel
on
us
that's
a
different
issue
than
whether
or
not
they're
dumping
agricultural
products
on
us
in
addition
to
that
we're
in
a
position
where
if
we
don't
set
the
rules
we
in
fact
are
going
to
find
ourselves
with
china
setting
the
rules
and
that's
why
you
need
to
organize
the
world
to
take
on
china
to
stop
the
corrupt
practices
that
are
underway
stephanopoulos
senator
booker
close
out
this
round
booker
sure
there's
one
point
we're
really
missing
on
the
stage
right
now
which
is
the
fact
that
donald
trump's
america
first
policy
is
actually
an
america
isolated
an
america
alone
policy
biden
exactly
right
booker
from
trade
to
battling
china
to
the
global
crisis
of
climate
change
the
challenges
in
the
middle
east
he
is
pulling
us
away
from
our
allies
out
of
the
iran
deal
out
of
the
paris
climate
accords
and
on
trade
he's
deciding
to
take
on
china
while
at
the
same
time
taking
on
tariff
battles
with
all
of
our
allies
you
literally
have
him
using
a
national
security
waiver
to
put
tariffs
on
canada
now
look
i'm
the
only
person
on
this
stage
that
finds
trudeau's
hair
very
menacing
but
they
are
not
a
national
security
threat
laughter
we
cannot
go
up
against
china
alone
this
is
a
president
that
has
a
better
relationship
with
dictators
like
duterte
and
putin
than
he
does
with
merkel
and
macron
we
are
the
strongest
nation
on
the
planet
earth
and
our
strength
is
multiplied
and
magnified
when
we
stand
with
our
allies
in
common
cause
and
common
purpose
that's
how
we
beat
china
that's
how
we
beat
climate
change
on
the
planet
earth
and
that's
how
american
values
are
the
ones
that
lead
on
issues
of
trade
and
workers
rights
applause
stephanopoulos
david
muir
george
thank
you
i
want
to
turn
now
to
our
troops
overseas
and
to
america's
longest
war
in
afghanistan
u.s.
talks
with
the
taliban
are
dead
according
to
the
president
secret
talks
at
camp
david
have
been
canceled
before
they
could
happen
many
of
you
have
weighed
in
on
that
already
so
i
want
to
move
past
that
tonight
to
what
all
of
you
have
promised
on
the
campaign
trail
many
of
you
on
this
stage
have
said
you'd
bring
the
troops
home
in
your
first
term
others
have
said
in
your
first
year
senator
warren
we
all
know
the
presidency
is
much
different
from
the
campaign
trail
president
obama
wanted
to
bring
the
troops
home
president
trump
promised
to
bring
the
troops
home
and
you
have
said
of
afghanistan
let's
help
them
reach
a
peace
settlement
it
is
time
to
bring
our
troops
home
in
your
words
starting
right
now
would
you
keep
that
promise
to
bring
the
troops
home
starting
right
now
with
no
deal
with
the
taliban
warren
yes
and
i'll
tell
you
why
what
we're
doing
right
now
in
afghanistan
is
not
helping
the
safety
and
security
of
the
united
states
it
is
not
helping
the
safety
and
security
of
the
world
it
is
not
helping
the
safety
and
security
of
afghanistan
we
need
to
bring
our
troops
home
and
then
we
need
to
make
a
big
shift
we
cannot
ask
our
military
to
keep
solving
problems
that
cannot
be
solved
militarily
applause
we're
not
going
to
bomb
our
way
to
a
solution
in
afghanistan
we
need
to
treat
the
problem
of
terrorism
as
a
worldwide
problem
and
that
means
we
need
to
be
working
with
all
of
our
allies
our
european
allies
our
canadian
allies
our
asian
allies
our
allies
in
africa
and
in
south
america
we
need
to
work
together
to
root
out
terrorism
it
means
using
all
of
our
tools
it
means
economic
investment
it
means
expanding
our
diplomatic
efforts
instead
of
hollowing
out
the
state
department
and
deliberately
making
it
so
we
have
no
eyes
and
ears
in
many
of
these
countries
we
need
a
foreign
policy
that
is
about
our
security
and
about
leading
on
our
values
stephanopoulos
senator
warren
a
quick
follow
on
that
because
top
u.s.
leaders
military
leaders
on
the
ground
in
afghanistan
told
me
you
can't
do
it
without
a
deal
with
the
taliban
you
just
said
you
would
you
would
bring
them
home
what
if
they
told
you
that
would
you
listen
to
their
advice
warren
i
was
in
afghanistan
with
john
mccain
two
years
ago
this
past
summer
i
think
it
may
have
been
senator
mccain's
last
trip
before
he
was
sick
and
i
talked
to
people
we
did
we
talked
to
military
leaders
american
and
local
leaders
we
talked
to
people
on
the
ground
and
asked
the
question
the
same
one
i
ask
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
every
time
one
of
the
generals
comes
through
show
me
what
winning
looks
like
tell
me
what
it
looks
like
and
what
you
hear
is
a
lot
of
uh
because
no
one
can
describe
it
and
the
reason
no
one
can
describe
it
is
because
the
problems
in
afghanistan
are
not
problems
that
can
be
solved
by
a
military
i
have
three
older
brothers
who
all
served
in
the
military
i
understand
firsthand
the
kind
of
commitment
they
have
made
they
will
do
anything
we
ask
them
to
do
but
we
cannot
ask
them
to
solve
problems
that
they
alone
cannot
solve
we
need
to
work
with
the
rest
of
the
world
we
need
to
use
our
economic
tools
we
need
to
use
our
diplomatic
tools
we
need
to
build
with
our
allies
and
we
need
to
make
the
whole
world
safer
not
keep
troops
bombing
in
afghanistan
muir
senator
warren
thank
you
applause
i
do
want
to
stay
on
this
and
i
want
to
turn
to
mayor
buttigieg
because
you're
the
only
veteran
on
this
stage
you
served
in
afghanistan
we
heard
in
recent
days
from
general
joseph
dunford
the
chair
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
who
said
in
recent
days
i'm
not
going
to
use
the
word
withdrawal
right
now
it's
our
judgment
the
afghans
need
support
to
deal
with
the
level
of
violence
if
he's
not
even
using
the
word
withdrawal
would
you
put
your
promise
to
bring
troops
home
in
the
first
year
on
hold
to
follow
the
advice
buttigieg
you
know
i
served
under
general
dunford
way
under
general
dunford
in
afghanistan
laughter
and
today
september
means
that
today
you
could
be
years
old
old
enough
to
serve
and
had
not
been
alive
on
we
have
got
to
put
an
end
to
endless
war
and
the
way
we
do
it
is
see
to
it
that
that
country
will
never
again
be
used
for
an
attack
against
our
homeland
and
that
does
not
require
an
open-ended
commitment
of
ground
troops
let
me
say
something
else
because
if
there's
one
thing
we've
learned
about
afghanistan
from
afghanistan
it's
that
the
best
way
not
to
be
caught
up
in
endless
war
is
to
avoid
starting
one
in
the
first
place
applause
and
so
when
i
am
president
an
authorization
for
the
use
of
military
force
will
have
a
built-in
three-year
sunset
congress
will
be
required
to
vote
and
a
president
will
be
required
to
go
to
congress
to
seek
an
authorization
because
if
our
troops
can
summon
the
courage
to
go
overseas
the
least
our
members
of
congress
should
be
able
to
do
is
summon
the
courage
to
take
a
vote
on
whether
they
ought
to
be
there
applause
by
the
way
we
also
have
a
president
right
now
who
seems
to
treat
troops
as
props
or
worse
tools
for
his
own
enrichment
we
saw
what's
going
on
with
flights
apparently
being
routed
through
scotland
just
so
people
can
stay
at
his
hotels
i'll
tell
you
as
a
military
officer
the
very
first
thing
that
goes
through
your
mind
the
first
time
you
ever
make
eye
contact
with
somebody
that
you
are
responsible
for
in
uniform
is
do
not
let
these
men
and
women
down
this
president
is
doing
exactly
that
i
will
not
applause
muir
mayor
buttigieg
thank
you
i
want
to
turn
to
vice
president
biden
because
the
concerns
about
any
possible
vacuum
being
created
in
afghanistan
if
you
pulled
the
u.s.
troops
out
has
been
heightened
by
what
we've
seen
in
recent
days
on
the
ground
in
iraq
when
you
were
vice
president
president
obama
turned
to
you
to
bring
the
troops
home
from
iraq
you
have
said
on
the
campaign
trail
quote
i
made
sure
the
president
turned
to
me
and
said
joe
get
our
combat
troops
out
of
iraq
there
was
a
major
drawdown
of
u.s.
troops
and
then
isis
seized
by
some
estimates
percent
of
the
territory
in
iraq
you
then
had
to
send
thousands
of
troops
back
in
was
it
wrong
to
pull
out
of
iraq
that
quickly
and
did
the
move
actually
help
isis
take
hold
biden
no
it
wasn't
wrong
to
pull
out
but
i
want
to
answer
your
afghanistan
question
i've
been
in
and
out
of
afghanistan
not
with
a
gun
and
i
admire
my
friend
for
his
service
but
i've
been
out
of
afghanistan
i
think
more
than
anybody
on
this
and
it's
an
open
secret
you
reported
a
long
time
ago
george
that
i
was
opposed
to
the
surge
in
afghanistan
the
whole
purpose
of
going
to
afghanistan
was
to
not
have
a
counterinsurgency
meaning
that
we're
going
to
put
that
country
together
it
cannot
be
put
together
let
me
say
it
again
it
will
not
be
put
together
it's
three
different
countries
pakistan
owns
the
three
counties
the
three
provinces
in
the
east
they're
not
any
part
of
the
haqqanis
run
it
i
will
go
on
and
on
but
here's
the
point
the
point
is
that
it's
a
counterterrorism
strategy
we
can
prevent
the
united
states
from
being
the
victim
of
terror
coming
out
of
afghanistan
by
providing
for
bases
insist
the
pakistanis
provide
bases
for
us
to
air
lift
from
and
to
move
against
what
we
know
we
don't
need
those
troops
there
i
would
bring
them
home
and
joe
dunford's
a
fine
guy
but
this
has
been
an
internal
argument
we've
had
for
eight
years
with
regard
to
with
regard
to
iraq
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
you
know
i
should
have
never
voted
to
give
bush
the
authority
to
go
in
and
do
what
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
the
aumf
was
designed
he
said
to
go
in
and
get
the
security
council
to
vote
to
allow
inspectors
to
go
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
anything
was
being
done
with
chemical
weapons
or
nuclear
weapons
and
when
that
happened
he
went
ahead
and
went
anyway
without
any
of
that
proof
i
said
something
that
was
not
meant
the
way
i
said
it
i
said
from
that
point
on
what
i
was
argued
against
in
the
beginning
once
he
started
to
put
the
troops
in
was
that
in
fact
we
were
doing
it
the
wrong
way
there
was
no
plan
we
should
not
be
engaged
we
didn't
have
the
people
with
us
we
didn't
have
our
we
didn't
have
allies
with
us
et
cetera
and
it
was
later
when
we
came
into
office
that
barack
turned
the
president
turned
to
me
and
said
joe
when
they
said
we've
got
a
plan
to
get
out
he
turned
to
the
whole
security
and
said
joe
will
organize
this
get
the
troops
home
my
son
spent
a
year
in
iraq
and
i
understand
it
made
and
we
were
right
to
get
the
combat
troops
out
the
big
mistake
that
was
made
which
we
predicted
was
that
you
would
not
have
a
circumstance
where
the
shia
and
the
kurds
would
work
together
to
keep
isis
from
coming
from
moving
in
muir
mr
vice
president
thank
you
i
want
to
turn
to
senator
sanders
on
this
because
the
concern
over
afghanistan
is
very
similar
to
what
we
saw
in
iraq
when
the
troops
came
out
isis
filled
that
vacuum
what
do
you
make
of
people
out
there
who
are
worried
that
if
we
pull
out
u.s.
troops
too
quickly
from
afghanistan
it
will
create
safe
haven
all
over
again
like
the
plotters
of
sanders
david
let
me
answer
that
but
let
me
just
comment
on
something
that
the
vice
president
said
you
talked
about
the
big
mistake
in
iraq
and
the
surge
the
truth
is
the
big
mistake
the
huge
mistake
and
one
of
the
big
differences
between
you
and
me
i
never
believed
what
cheney
and
bush
said
about
iraq
applause
biden
you're
right
sanders
i
voted
against
the
war
in
iraq
applause
and
helped
lead
the
opposition
and
it's
sad
to
say
i
mean
i
kind
of
you
know
had
the
feeling
that
there
would
be
massive
destabilization
in
that
area
if
we
went
into
that
war
as
the
former
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
veterans
affairs
i
want
to
pick
up
on
what
pete
said
we
cannot
express
our
gratitude
to
all
of
the
men
and
women
who
have
put
their
lives
on
the
line
to
defend
them
defend
us
who
have
responded
to
the
call
of
duty
but
i
think
also
i
am
the
only
person
up
here
to
have
voted
against
all
three
of
trump's
military
budgets
applause
i
don't
think
we
have
to
spend
billion
a
year
on
the
military
when
we
don't
even
know
who
our
enemy
is
applause
i
think
that
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
bring
this
world
together
bring
it
together
on
climate
change
bring
it
together
in
fighting
against
terrorism
and
make
it
clear
that
we
as
a
planet
as
a
global
community
will
work
together
to
help
countries
around
the
world
rebuild
their
struggling
economies
and
do
everything
that
we
can
to
rid
the
world
of
terrorism
but
dropping
bomb
on
afghanistan
and
iraq
was
not
the
way
to
do
it
muir
senator
sanders
thank
you
applause
i
want
to
take
this
to
mr
yang
you
share
the
stage
as
you
know
when
when
we
talk
about
troops
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
with
the
vice
president
who
was
in
the
situation
room
with
senators
who
were
on
the
senate
armed
services
the
foreign
relations
committees
with
an
afghanistan
veteran
who
is
on
the
stage
tonight
as
you
share
the
stage
with
these
candidates
what
makes
you
the
most
qualified
on
this
stage
to
be
commander
in
chief
yang
i've
signed
a
pledge
to
end
the
forever
wars
we've
been
in
a
state
of
continuous
armed
conflict
for
years
which
is
not
what
the
american
people
want
we
have
to
start
owning
what
we
can
and
can't
do
we're
not
very
good
at
rebuilding
countries
and
if
you
want
proof
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
within
our
own
country
of
puerto
rico
applause
we've
spent
trillions
of
dollars
to
unclear
benefits
lost
thousands
of
lives
and
thank
you
pete
for
your
service
and
the
goal
has
to
be
to
rebuild
the
relationships
that
have
made
america
strong
for
decades
i
would
lead
our
armed
forces
with
restraint
and
judgment
what
the
american
people
want
is
simply
a
president
who
has
the
right
values
and
point
of
view
and
they
can
trust
to
make
the
right
decisions
when
it
comes
to
putting
our
young
men
and
women
into
harm's
way
and
that's
what
i
would
do
as
president
muir
mr
yang
thank
you
applause
jorge
ramos
thank
you
very
much
speaking
in
spanish
ph
you
haven't
been
asked
about
latin
america
in
the
previous
debates
so
let's
begin
senator
sanders
one
country
where
many
immigrants
are
arriving
from
is
venezuela
a
recent
u.n.
fact-finding
mission
found
that
thousands
have
been
disappeared
tortured
and
killed
by
government
forces
in
venezuela
you
admit
that
venezuela
does
not
have
free
elections
but
still
you
refuse
to
call
nicolas
maduro
a
dictator
a
dictator
can
you
explain
why
and
what
are
the
main
differences
between
your
kind
of
socialism
and
the
one
being
imposed
in
venezuela
cuba
and
nicaragua
sanders
well
first
of
all
let
me
be
very
clear
anybody
who
does
what
maduro
does
is
a
vicious
tyrant
what
we
need
now
is
international
and
regional
cooperation
for
free
elections
in
venezuela
so
that
the
people
of
that
country
can
make
can
create
their
own
future
in
terms
of
democratic
socialism
to
equate
what
goes
on
in
venezuela
with
what
i
believe
is
extremely
unfair
i'll
tell
you
what
i
believe
in
terms
of
democratic
socialism
i
agree
with
goes
on
in
canada
and
in
scandinavia
guaranteeing
health
care
to
all
people
as
a
human
right
applause
i
believe
that
the
united
states
should
not
be
the
only
major
country
on
earth
not
to
provide
paid
family
and
medical
leave
applause
i
believe
that
every
worker
in
this
country
deserves
a
living
wage
and
that
we
expand
the
trade
union
movement
applause
i
happen
to
believe
also
that
what
to
me
democratic
socialism
means
is
we
deal
with
an
issue
we
do
not
discuss
enough
jorge
it's
not
in
the
media
and
not
in
congress
you've
got
three
people
in
america
owning
more
wealth
than
the
bottom
half
of
this
country
you've
got
a
handful
of
billionaires
controlling
what
goes
on
in
wall
street
the
insurance
companies
and
in
the
media
maybe
just
maybe
what
we
should
be
doing
is
creating
an
economy
ramos
thank
you
sanders
that
works
for
all
of
us
not
percent
that's
my
understanding
of
democratic
socialism
applause
ramos
secretary
you
wanted
to
say
a
quick
response
seconds
castro
sure
thank
you
jorge
i'll
call
maduro
a
dictator
because
he
is
a
dictator
applause
and
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
along
with
our
allies
make
sure
that
the
venezuelan
people
get
the
assistance
that
they
need
that
we
continue
to
pressure
venezuela
so
that
they'll
have
free
and
fair
elections
and
also
here
in
the
united
states
offer
temporary
protected
status
tps
to
venezuelans
applause
that
is
something
that
the
trump
administration
has
failed
to
do
for
all
of
his
big
talk
about
supporting
the
venezuelan-american
community
he
has
failed
i
will
not
i
also
believe
that
we
need
to
do
things
like
a
st
century
marshall
plan
for
honduras
el
salvador
and
guatemala
applause
so
that
people
can
find
safety
and
opportunity
at
home
instead
of
having
to
make
the
dangerous
journey
to
the
united
states
and
under
my
administration
we're
going
to
put
renewed
focus
on
latin
america
it
makes
sense
they're
our
neighbors
and
we
have
a
lot
of
things
in
common
it
also
makes
sense
that
because
we
have
a
country
like
china
that
is
going
around
the
world
to
places
like
africa
and
latin
america
making
their
own
relationships
strengthening
those
the
united
states
needs
to
strengthen
its
partnerships
in
latin
america
immediately
ramos
thank
you
senator
castro
and
i
will
ramos
senator
booker
let
me
ask
you
about
brazil
after
the
recent
fires
in
the
amazon
some
experts
suggested
that
eating
less
meat
is
one
way
to
help
the
environment
you
are
a
vegan
since
that's
obviously
a
personal
choice
but
president
trump
and
brazil's
president
bolsonaro
are
concerned
that
climate
change
regulations
could
affect
economic
growth
so
should
more
americans
including
those
here
in
texas
and
in
iowa
laughter
follow
your
diet
laughter
booker
um
ph
you
know
first
of
all
i
want
to
say
no
actually
i
want
to
translate
that
into
spanish
no
laughter
applause
look
on
let's
just
be
clear
the
factory
farming
going
on
that's
assaulting
this
corporate
consolidation
of
the
agricultural
industry
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
have
a
bill
to
put
a
moratorium
on
this
kind
of
corporate
consolidation
is
because
this
factory
farming
is
destroying
and
hurting
our
environment
and
you
see
independent
family
farmers
being
pushed
out
of
business
because
of
the
kind
of
incentives
we
are
giving
that
don't
line
up
with
our
values
that's
what
i'm
calling
for
applause
but
i
want
to
i
want
to
switch
because
we
don't
have
a
crowded
debate
stage
we
were
talking
about
afghanistan
and
iraq
it
annoys
me
that
we
had
a
conversation
about
our
troops
overseas
and
we
didn't
say
one
word
about
veterans
in
our
country
applause
we
have
a
shameful
reality
in
america
that
we
send
people
off
to
war
and
they
often
come
home
with
invisible
wounds
hurts
and
harms
they're
disproportionately
homeless
you
hear
stories
about
women
waiting
for
months
for
gynecological
care
through
the
va
it
is
very
important
that
as
we
as
a
country
understand
that
we
are
not
going
to
solve
every
problem
with
this
outrageous
increased
militarism
that
we
also
make
sure
that
we
stand
up
for
the
people
that
stood
for
us
we
end
our
national
anthem
with
home
of
the
brave
it's
about
time
we
make
this
a
better
home
for
our
bravest
laughter
ramos
congressman
o'rourke
hurricane
harvey
hit
this
town
two
years
ago
and
not
only
is
the
amazon
burning
greenland
is
melting
at
a
record
pace
the
last
five
years
have
been
the
hottest
ever
recorded
and
we
have
a
viewer's
question
about
this
what
meaningful
action
will
you
take
to
reverse
the
effect
of
climate
change
and
can
we
count
on
you
to
follow
through
if
your
donors
are
against
it
o'rourke
yes
we
will
follow
through
regardless
of
the
political
consequences
or
who
it
offends
because
this
is
the
very
future
of
our
planet
and
our
ability
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
to
be
able
to
survive
on
it
we
will
make
sure
that
we
get
to
net
zero
greenhouse
gas
emissions
no
later
than
the
year
that
we
are
halfway
there
by
that
we
mobilize
trillion
over
the
next
years
to
do
that
that
we
invest
here
in
houston
texas
with
pre-disaster
mitigation
grants
to
protect
those
communities
that
are
vulnerable
to
flooding
given
the
fact
that
this
town
has
seen
three
year
floods
in
just
five
years
you'd
like
to
think
you're
good
for
years
but
you're
not
they're
coming
faster
and
larger
and
more
devastating
than
ever
we're
also
going
to
make
sure
that
we
free
ourselves
from
a
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
and
embrace
renewable
wind
and
solar
energy
technology
as
well
as
the
high-paying
high-skill
high-wage
jobs
that
come
along
with
that
and
that
we're
going
to
pay
farmers
for
the
environmental
services
they
want
to
provide
planting
cover
crops
keeping
more
land
under
conservation
using
no-till
farming
regenerative
agriculture
can
pull
carbon
out
of
the
air
and
can
drive
it
and
sequester
it
into
the
soil
that's
the
way
that
we're
going
to
meet
this
challenge
and
we're
going
to
bring
everyone
into
the
solution
ramos
many
of
you
want
to
comment
let's
see
if
we
can
go
very
fast
senator
klobuchar
klobuchar
thank
you
this
is
the
existential
crisis
of
our
time
it's
you
know
that
movie
the
day
after
tomorrow
it's
today
we
have
seen
a
warming
in
our
world
like
never
before
we're
seeing
flooding
in
the
midwest
flooding
in
houston
fires
in
the
west
and
i
think
having
someone
leading
the
ticket
from
the
midwest
will
allow
us
to
talk
about
this
in
a
different
way
and
get
it
done
on
day
one
i
will
get
us
back
into
the
international
climate
change
agreement
on
day
two
i
will
bring
back
the
clean
power
rules
that
president
obama
had
worked
on
on
day
three
i
will
bring
back
the
gas
mileage
standards
you
can
do
all
that
without
congress
which
is
good
on
day
four
five
and
six
i
will
working
with
congress
and
mayors
and
business
people
all
over
the
country
introduce
sweeping
legislation
to
get
at
that
goal
and
on
day
seven
you're
supposed
to
rest
but
i
won't
this
is
what
we
need
to
do
if
we're
going
to
get
at
climate
change
we
have
to
take
this
on
as
a
crisis
that's
happening
right
now
ramos
senator
warren
should
american
foreign
policy
be
based
around
the
principle
of
climate
change
warren
yes
we
need
to
work
on
every
front
on
climate
change
it
is
the
threat
to
every
living
thing
on
this
planet
and
we
are
running
out
of
time
every
time
the
scientists
go
back
they
say
we
have
less
and
less
time
than
we
thought
we
had
but
that
means
we've
got
to
use
all
the
tools
one
of
the
tools
we
need
to
use
are
our
regulatory
tools
i
have
proposed
following
governor
inslee
that
we
by
cut
all
carbon
emissions
from
new
buildings
by
carbon
emissions
from
cars
and
by
all
carbon
emissions
from
the
manufacture
of
electricity
that
alone
those
three
will
cut
our
emissions
here
in
the
united
states
by
percent
we
can
do
this
we
also
need
to
help
around
the
world
to
clean
but
understand
this
one
more
time
why
doesn't
it
happen
as
long
as
washington
is
paying
more
attention
to
money
than
it
is
to
our
future
we
can't
make
the
changes
we
need
to
make
we
have
to
attack
the
corruption
head-on
so
that
we
can
save
our
planet
applause
ramos
senator
harris
seconds
harris
when
i
think
about
this
issue
it
really
is
through
the
lens
of
my
baby
nieces
who
are
one-and-a-half
and
three
years
old
when
i
look
at
what
is
going
to
be
the
world
if
we
do
nothing
when
they
turn
i
am
really
scared
and
when
i've
been
in
the
united
states
senate
for
now
the
last
two-and-a-half
years
and
i
look
at
our
counterparts
the
republicans
in
the
united
states
senate
they
must
be
looking
at
their
children
and
then
when
they
look
at
the
mirror
i
don't
know
what
they
see
but
it's
a
lack
of
courage
and
this
is
an
issue
that
yes
it
represents
a
existential
threat
it
is
also
something
that
we
can
do
something
about
this
is
a
problem
that
was
created
by
human
behaviors
and
we
can
change
our
behaviors
in
a
way
that
saves
our
planet
i've
seen
it
happen
in
california
i
took
on
as
the
attorney
general
of
california
i
ran
the
second-largest
department
of
justice
in
the
united
states
second
only
to
the
united
states
department
of
justice
i
took
on
the
big
oil
companies
and
we
saw
progress
if
any
of
you
have
been
to
los
angeles
years
ago
you'll
remember
that
sky
was
brown
you
go
there
now
the
sky
is
blue
and
you
know
why
because
leaders
decided
to
lead
and
we
took
on
these
big
fossil
fuel
companies
we
have
some
of
the
most
important
and
strongest
laws
in
the
country
and
we
made
a
difference
and
my
point
being
i've
done
it
before
and
i
will
lead
as
president
on
this
issue
because
we
have
no
time
the
clock
is
ticking
but
we
need
courage
and
we
need
courageous
leadership
we
can
get
this
done
ramos
mr
yang
yang
so
to
follow
up
on
what
elizabeth
said
why
are
we
losing
to
the
fossil
fuel
companies
warren
yes
yang
why
are
we
losing
to
the
gun
lobby
and
the
nra
and
is
answer
is
this
we
all
know
everyone
on
this
stage
knows
that
our
government
has
been
overrun
by
money
and
corporate
interests
now
everyone
here
has
a
plan
to
try
to
curb
those
corporate
interests
but
we
have
to
face
facts
money
finds
a
way
money
will
find
its
way
back
in
so
what
is
the
answer
the
answer
is
to
wash
the
money
out
with
people-powered
money
applause
my
proposal
is
that
we
give
every
american
democracy
dollars
that
you
can
only
give
to
candidates
and
causes
that
you
like
this
would
wash
out
the
lobbyist
cash
by
a
factor
of
eight
to
one
that
is
the
only
way
we
will
win
and
as
someone
running
for
president
i'll
tell
you
there's
the
people
on
one
side
and
the
money
on
the
other
the
only
way
for
us
to
win
is
if
we
bring
them
together
applause
ramos
thank
you
mr
yang
linsey
davis
i'd
like
to
have
an
academic
discussion
now
about
education
mr
yang
we'll
stay
with
you
here
in
houston
the
school
district
is
facing
yet
another
year
of
spending
cuts
like
schools
across
the
country
the
system
faces
many
challenges
one
of
them
thousands
of
students
are
leaving
traditional
public
schools
and
going
to
charter
schools
you're
the
most
vocal
proponent
on
this
stage
for
charter
schools
you
have
said
that
democrats
who
want
to
limit
them
are
quote
just
jumping
into
bed
with
teachers
unions
and
doing
kids
a
disservice
why
isn't
taxpayer
money
better
spent
on
fixing
traditional
public
schools
yang
let
me
be
clear
i
am
pro-good
school
i've
got
a
kid
one
of
my
little
boys
just
started
public
school
last
week
and
i
was
not
there
because
i
was
running
for
president
laughter
so
we
need
to
pay
teachers
more
because
the
data
clearly
shows
that
a
good
teacher
is
worth
his
or
her
weight
in
gold
applause
we
need
to
lighten
up
the
emphasis
on
standardized
tests
which
do
not
measure
anything
fundamental
about
our
character
or
human
worth
applause
but
here's
the
big
one
the
data
clearly
shows
that
to
percent
of
our
students
outcomes
are
determined
outside
of
the
school
we're
talking
about
time
spent
at
home
with
the
parents
words
read
to
them
when
they're
young
stress
levels
in
the
house
income
type
of
neighborhood
we're
putting
money
into
schools
and
educators
know
this
we're
saying
you're
percent
responsible
for
educating
your
kids
but
you
can
only
control
percent
they
all
know
this
the
answer
is
to
put
money
directly
into
the
families
and
neighborhoods
to
give
our
kids
a
chance
to
learn
and
our
teachers
a
chance
to
teach
applause
davis
mayor
buttigieg
seconds
to
respond
buttigieg
step
one
is
appoint
a
secretary
of
education
who
actually
believes
in
public
education
applause
i
believe
in
public
education
and
in
order
to
strengthen
it
some
things
are
very
complex
for
preparing
for
a
future
where
knowledge
is
at
your
fingertips
but
we
have
got
to
teach
more
to
do
with
critical
thinking
and
social
and
emotional
learning
some
of
it
is
extremely
simple
we
have
just
got
to
pay
teachers
more
and
we
have
got
to
lift
up
the
teaching
profession
i
always
think
of
a
story
from
south
bend
of
friends
who
hosted
exchange
students
from
japan
they
had
a
student
one
year
who
wanted
to
be
a
teacher
and
they
kept
in
touch
with
her
when
she
went
back
to
japan
and
to
college
she
took
the
exam
to
try
to
become
a
teacher
in
a
society
that
really
regards
teachers
and
compensates
teachers
well
and
she
came
up
just
short
so
you
know
what
she
did
since
she
was
academically
good
but
couldn't
quite
make
the
cut
to
be
a
teacher
she
had
a
fall-back
plan
she
became
a
doctor
that
is
how
seriously
some
countries
treat
the
teaching
profession
if
we
want
to
get
the
results
that
we
expect
for
our
children
we
have
to
support
and
compensate
the
teaching
profession
respect
teachers
the
way
we
do
soldiers
and
pay
them
more
like
the
way
we
do
doctors
applause
davis
senator
warren
to
use
mr
yang's
term
are
you
just
jumping
into
bed
with
teachers
unions
warren
you
know
i
think
i'm
the
only
person
on
this
stage
who
has
been
a
public
school
teacher
applause
i
had
wanted
to
be
a
public
school
teacher
since
i
was
in
second
grade
and
let's
be
clear
in
all
the
ways
we
talk
about
this
money
for
public
schools
should
stay
in
public
schools
not
go
anywhere
else
applause
i've
already
made
my
commitment
i
will
we
will
have
a
secretary
of
education
who
has
been
a
public
school
teacher
applause
i
think
this
is
ultimately
about
our
values
i
have
proposed
a
two-cent
wealth
tax
on
the
top
one-tenth
of
one
percent
in
this
country
that
would
give
us
enough
money
to
start
with
our
babies
by
providing
universal
child
care
for
every
baby
age
zero
to
five
universal
pre-k
for
every
three-year-old
and
four-year-old
in
this
country
davis
thank
you
senator
warren
raise
the
wages
of
every
childcare
worker
and
preschool
teacher
in
this
country
cancel
student
loan
debt
for
percent
of
the
folks
who've
got
it
applause
davis
thank
you
senator
warren
and
strengthen
our
unions
this
is
how
we
build
an
america
that
reflects
our
values
not
just
where
the
money
comes
from
with
the
billionaires
and
corporate
executives
davis
senator
harris
seconds
to
respond
harris
my
first
grade
teacher
mrs
frances
wilson
ph
god
rest
her
soul
attended
my
law
school
graduation
i
think
most
of
us
would
say
that
we
are
not
where
we
are
without
the
teachers
who
believed
in
us
i
have
offered
in
this
campaign
a
proposal
to
deal
with
this
which
will
be
the
first
in
the
nation
federal
investment
in
closing
the
teacher
pay
gap
which
is
a
year
because
right
now
in
our
public
schools
our
teachers
percent
of
them
are
coming
out
of
their
own
pocket
to
help
pay
for
school
supplies
and
that
is
wrong
i
also
want
to
talk
about
where
we
are
here
at
tsu
and
what
it
means
in
terms
of
hbcus
i
have
as
part
of
my
proposal
that
we
will
put
trillion
into
investing
in
our
hbcus
for
teachers
because
applause
because
because
one
as
a
proud
graduate
of
a
historically
black
college
and
university
i
will
say
i
will
say
that
it
is
our
hbcus
that
disproportionately
produce
teachers
and
those
who
serve
in
these
may
professions
but
also
davis
thank
you
senator
harris
but
this
is
a
critical
point
if
a
black
child
has
a
black
teacher
before
the
end
of
third
grade
they're
percent
more
likely
to
go
to
college
applause
if
that
child
has
had
two
black
teachers
before
the
end
of
third
grade
they're
percent
more
likely
to
go
to
college
so
when
we
talk
about
investing
in
our
public
education
system
it
is
at
the
source
of
so
much
when
we
fix
it
that
will
fix
so
many
other
things
we
must
invest
in
the
potential
of
our
children
davis
thank
yo
senator
senator
sanders
seconds
harris
and
i
strongly
believe
you
can
judge
a
society
based
on
how
it
treats
its
children
and
we
are
failing
on
this
issue
davis
thank
you
senator
applause
sanders
guess
what
laughter
you're
guessing
all
right
here's
the
answer
we
are
the
wealthiest
country
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
yet
we
have
the
highest
child
poverty
rate
of
almost
any
country
on
earth
we
have
teachers
in
this
country
who
are
leaving
education
because
they
can't
work
two
or
three
jobs
to
support
themselves
which
is
why
under
my
legislation
we'll
move
to
see
that
every
teacher
in
america
makings
at
least
a
year
applause
what
we
will
also
do
is
not
only
have
universal
pre-k
we
will
make
public
colleges
and
universities
and
hbcus
debt-free
and
what
we
will
always
also
do
because
this
is
an
incredible
burden
on
millions
and
millions
of
young
people
who
did
nothing
wrong
except
try
to
get
the
education
they
need
we
are
going
to
cancel
all
student
debt
in
this
country
applause
davis
thank
you
senator
thank
you
senator
sanders
and
we
are
going
to
do
that
by
imposing
a
tax
on
wall
street
speculation
applause
davis
thank
you
senator
mr
vice
president
i
want
to
come
to
you
and
talk
to
you
about
inequality
in
schools
and
race
in
a
conversation
about
how
to
deal
with
segregation
in
schools
back
in
you
told
a
reporter
i
don't
feel
responsible
for
the
sins
of
my
father
and
grandfather
i
feel
responsible
for
what
the
situation
is
today
for
the
sins
of
my
own
generation
and
i'll
be
damned
if
i
feel
responsible
to
pay
for
what
happened
years
ago
you
said
that
some
years
ago
but
as
you
stand
here
tonight
what
responsibility
do
you
think
that
americans
need
to
take
to
repair
the
legacy
of
slavery
in
our
country
biden
well
they
have
to
deal
with
the
look
there's
institutional
segregation
in
this
country
and
from
the
time
i
got
involved
i
started
dealing
with
that
red-lining
banks
making
sure
that
we
are
in
a
position
where
look
you
talk
about
education
i
propose
that
what
we
take
is
those
very
poor
schools
the
title
i
schools
triple
the
amount
of
money
we
spend
from
to
billion
a
year
give
every
single
teacher
a
raise
the
equal
raise
to
getting
out
the
level
number
two
make
sure
that
we
bring
in
to
help
the
teachers
deal
with
the
problems
that
come
from
home
the
problems
that
come
from
home
we
need
we
have
one
school
psychologist
for
every
kids
in
america
today
it's
crazy
the
teachers
are
i'm
married
to
a
teacher
my
deceased
wife
is
a
teacher
they
have
every
problem
coming
to
them
we
have
make
sure
that
every
single
child
does
in
fact
have
and
year-olds
go
to
school
school
not
daycare
school
we
bring
social
workers
in
to
homes
and
parents
to
help
them
deal
with
how
to
raise
their
children
it's
not
want
they
don't
want
to
help
they
don't
they
don't
know
quite
what
to
do
play
the
radio
make
sure
the
television
excuse
me
make
sure
you
have
the
record
player
on
at
night
the
the
make
sure
that
kids
hear
words
a
kid
coming
from
a
very
poor
school
a
very
poor
background
will
hear
million
words
fewer
spoken
by
the
time
they
get
there
davis
thank
you
mr
vice
president
biden
there's
so
much
we
no
i'm
going
to
go
like
the
rest
of
them
do
twice
over
ok
applause
because
here's
the
deal
the
deal
is
that
we've
got
this
a
little
backwards
and
by
the
way
in
venezuela
we
should
be
allowing
people
to
come
here
from
venezuela
i
know
maduro
i've
confronted
maduro
number
two
you
talk
about
the
need
to
do
something
in
latin
america
i'm
the
guy
that
came
up
with
million
to
see
to
it
those
three
countries
in
fact
changed
their
system
so
people
don't
have
to
chance
to
leave
you're
all
acting
like
we
just
discovered
this
yesterday
thank
you
very
much
davis
thank
you
very
much
secretary
castro
castro
thank
you
very
much
well
that's
that's
quite
a
lot
biden
off-mike
laughter
castro
but
you
know
i
grew
up
in
one
of
those
neighborhoods
that
folks
have
talked
about
and
a
neighborhood
that
was
grappling
with
the
legacy
of
segregation
in
fact
in
two
public
school
districts
that
were
involved
in
a
supreme
court
case
challenging
how
texas
financed
its
schools
and
i
know
that
today
our
schools
are
segregated
because
our
neighborhoods
are
segregated
now
i
have
an
education
plan
like
a
lot
of
folks
up
here
that
would
pay
teachers
more
that
would
recruit
diverse
ranks
of
teachers
that
would
invest
in
our
public
schools
but
i
also
believe
that
we
have
to
connect
the
dots
to
uplift
the
quality
of
life
to
invest
in
housing
opportunity
to
invest
in
job
opportunity
to
invest
in
community
schools
that
offer
resources
like
parents
able
to
go
back
and
get
their
ged
and
health
care
opportunities
and
those
things
that
truly
ensure
that
the
entire
family
can
prosper
those
are
the
types
of
things
that
we
need
to
do
in
addition
to
lifting
up
our
public
schools
you
asked
a
second
ago
about
charter
schools
look
it
is
a
myth
that
charter
schools
are
better
than
public
schools
they're
not
applause
davis
thank
you
secretary
castro
and
so
while
i'm
not
categorically
against
charter
schools
i
would
require
more
transparency
and
accountability
from
them
than
is
required
right
now
davis
senator
booker
coming
to
you
now
it
was
years
ago
this
year
that
the
supreme
court
outlawed
racial
segregation
in
public
schools
yet
for
millions
of
students
of
color
today
segregation
remains
a
reality
nonwhite
districts
typically
receive
less
per
student
than
those
in
white
districts
this
means
older
books
less
access
to
computers
and
often
worse
outcomes
what
is
your
plan
to
address
segregation
and
i'm
not
just
talking
about
the
achievement
gap
but
i'm
talking
about
the
opportunity
gap
in
education
booker
so
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
conversations
on
the
stage
that
and
the
way
we
talk
about
communities
of
color
look
i
live
in
a
black
and
brown
community
below
the
poverty
line
i've
lived
in
public
housing
projects
almost
for
a
decade
and
saw
the
anguish
of
parents
who
are
just
so
deeply
frustrated
that
they
don't
have
a
school
that
serves
their
genius
i
think
i'm
the
only
person
on
the
stage
even
though
i
had
no
formal
authority
as
mayor
to
run
a
school
system
i
stepped
up
and
took
responsibility
for
our
schools
and
we
produced
results
a
lot
of
folks
here
are
talking
about
raising
teacher
salary
we
actually
did
it
in
newark
new
jersey
and
we
didn't
stop
there
yeah
we
closed
poor-performing
charter
schools
but
dagnabbit
we
expanded
high-performing
charter
schools
we
were
a
city
that
said
we
need
to
find
local
solutions
that
work
for
our
community
the
results
speak
for
themselves
we're
now
the
number-one
city
in
america
for
beat
the
odds
schools
from
high
poverty
to
high
performance
strategies
like
investing
in
our
children
work
and
i'll
tell
you
this
i
am
tired
of
us
thinking
about
these
problems
isolated
disconnected
from
other
issues
that's
why
my
friend
secretary
castro
is
percent
right
we
are
in
the
reality
we
are
right
now
because
mr
vice
president
of
overtly
racist
policies
not
years
ago
just
in
my
lifetime
that
were
red-lining
communities
disinvesting
in
communities
and
more
than
just
that
my
kids
are
not
only
struggling
with
racial
segregation
and
housing
and
the
challenges
of
underfunded
schools
but
they're
also
struggling
with
environmental
injustice
if
you've
talked
to
someone
who's
a
parent
of
a
child
has
had
permanent
brain
damage
because
of
lead
you'll
know
this
is
a
national
problem
because
there's
over
jurisdictions
in
america
where
children
have
more
than
twice
the
blood

davis
thank
you
senator
booker
and
so
if
i'm
president
of
the
united
states
it
is
a
holistic
solution
to
education
from
raising
teacher
salary
fully
funded
special
education
but
combatting
the
issues
of
poverty
combatting
the
issues
of
racial
segregation
combatting
the
issues
of
a
criminal
justice
system
davis
thank
you
senator
booker
that
takes
parents
away
from
their
kids
and
dealing
with
environmental
justice
as
a
major
pillar
of
any
climate
policy
stephanopoulos
thank
you
linsey
one
final
question
coming
up
we'll
be
right
back
commercial
break
stephanopoulos
and
we
are
now
back
now
for
a
final
round
of
questions
one
question
for
each
candidate
we're
going
to
go
in
reverse
order
from
the
opening
statement
and
candidates
the
question
is
on
the
quality
of
resilience
no
president
can
succeed
without
resilience
every
president
confronts
crises
defeats
and
mistakes
so
i
want
to
ask
each
of
you
what's
the
most
significant
professional
setback
you've
had
to
face
how
did
you
recover
from
it
and
what
did
you
learn
from
it
vice
president
biden
biden
i
i
never
counted
any
professional
setback
like
i
have
as
a
serious
setback
there's
things
that
are
important
things
that
are
unimportant
protesters
off-mike
stephanopoulos
we're
going
to
clear
the
protesters
now
just
one
minute
senator
biden
we'll
start
the
clock
again
protesters
off-mike
biden
i'm
sorry
stephanopoulos
we're
sorry
go
ahead
biden
there's
setbacks
and
there's
setbacks
and
i
think
the
most
critical
setback
that
can
occur
to
anyone
is
to
lose
well
my
dad
had
an
expression
he
said
joey
it's
not
a
question
of
succeeding
whether
you
get
knocked
down
it's
how
quickly
you
get
up
and
he
said
you
never
explain
and
never
complain
and
then
he
would
go
on
to
say
that
the
only
obligation
that
really
matters
the
most
important
thing
is
family
and
so
i
was
raised
to
believe
that
that
was
the
center
of
everything
family
and
could
be
judged
on
based
how
you
treatment
your
family
and
how
you
went
from
there
and
i
it
took
you
know
kierkegaard
said
faith
sees
best
in
the
dark
right
after
i
got
elected
my
wife
and
daughter
were
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
and
my
two
sons
were
badly
injured
and
i
just
had
been
elected
not
sworn
in
and
i
lost
my
faith
for
a
while
i
came
back
and
then
later
when
my
son
beau
came
home
from
iraq
and
with
a
terminal
disease
and
a
year
later
year-and-a-half
later
losing
him
was
like
losing
part
of
my
soul
but
the
fact
is
that
i
learned
that
the
way
you
deal
with
it
is
you
deal
with
finding
purpose
purpose
in
what
you
do
and
that's
why
i
hope
i
hope
he's
proud
of
me
today
because
he
wanted
to
make
sure
i
didn't
run
for
president
but
i
stayed
engaged
because
when
you
get
hit
badly
whether
you're
losing
a
job
or
you're
raising
a
family
like
my
dad
where
you
have
to
make
that
longest
walk
up
the
stairs
to
tell
your
kid
you
can't
live
here
anymore
dad
lost
his
job
you
know
we've
all
been
through
that
in
some
form
or
another
and
it
just
takes
it
just
for
me
the
way
i've
dealt
with
it
is
finding
purpose
and
my
purpose
is
to
do
what
i've
always
tried
to
do
and
stay
engaged
in
public
policy
and
but
there's
a
lot
of
people
been
through
a
lot
worse
than
i
have
who
get
up
every
single
morning
put
their
feet
one
foot
in
front
of
another
without
the
help
i
had
there
are
real
heroes
out
there
some
real
heroes

i
mentioned
earlier
i've
known
what
i
wanted
to
be
since
second
grade
i
wanted
to
be
a
public
school
teacher
and
i
invested
early
i
used
to
line
my
dollies
up
and
teach
school
i
had
a
reputation
for
being
tough
but
fair
laughter
by
the
time
i
graduated
from
high
school
my
family
didn't
have
money
for
a
college
application
much
less
to
send
me
off
to
four
years
at
a
university
and
my
story
like
a
lot
of
stories
has
a
lot
of
twists
and
turns
got
a
scholarship
and
then
at
i
got
married
dropped
out
of
school
took
a
minimum
wage
job
thought
my
dream
was
over
i
got
a
chance
down
the
road
at
the
university
of
houston
and
i
made
it
as
a
special
needs
teacher
i
still
remember
that
first
year
as
a
special
needs
teacher
i
could
tell
you
what
those
babies
looked
like
i
had
to
year-olds
but
at
the
end
of
that
first
year
i
was
visibly
pregnant
and
back
in
the
day
that
meant
that
the
principal
said
to
me
wished
me
luck
and
hired
someone
else
for
the
job
so
there
i
am
i'm
at
home
i
got
a
baby
i
can't
have
a
job
what
am
i
going
to
do
here's
resilience
i
said
i'll
go
to
law
school
and
the
consequence
was
i
practiced
law
for
about
minutes
and
then
went
back
to
my
first
love
which
was
teaching
but
it
let
me
get
into
fights
it
gave
me
new
tools
and
the
reason
i'm
standing
here
today
is
because
i
got
back
up
i
fought
back
i
know
what's
broken
i
want
to
be
in
the
fight
to
fix
it
in
america
that's
why
i'm
here

resilience
to
me
means
growing
up
in
a
rent-controlled
apartment
in
brooklyn
new

the
son
of
an
immigrant
who
came
to
this
country
without

resilience
means

running
for

and
getting
percent

finally
becoming
mayor
of
burlington
vermont
with
a

margin
what
resilience
means
to
me
is
that
throughout
my
political
career
i
have
taken
on
virtually
every
powerful
special
interest
in
this
country
whether
it
is
wall

whether
it
is
the
insurance

whether
it
is

corruption

is
killing
people
today
whether
it
is
a

i
feel
confident
that
given
a
lifelong
record
of
taking
on
powerful
special
interests
of
standing
up
for
the
working
families
of
this
country
that
i
will
be
able
to
take
on
the
greed
and
corruption
of
the

create
a

senator
harris
harris
you
know
every
office
i've
run
for
whether
it
be
district
attorney
or
attorney
general
i
was
told
each
time
it
can't
be
done
they
said
nobody
like
you
has
done
it
before
nobody's
ready
for
you
when
i
ran
for
d.a.
i
won
and
became
the
first
black
woman
elected
d.a.
in
a
state
of
million
people
in
san
francisco
when
i
ran
for
attorney
general
of
california
i
was
elected
because
i
didn't
listen
and
i
was
the
only
black
elected
woman
black
elected
attorney
general
in
the
state
in
the
country
and
each
time
people
would
say
it's
not
your
time
it's
not
your
turn
it's
going
to
be
too
difficult
they're
not
ready
for
you
and
i
didn't
listen
and
a
part
of
it
probably
comes
from
the
fact
that
i
was
raised
by
a
mother
who
said
many
things
that
were
life
lessons
for
me
including
don't
you
let
anybody
ever
tell
you
who
you
are
you
tell
them
who
you
are

and
when
i
look
around
the
town
halls
that
we
do
in
this
race
for
president
of
the
united

and
i
look
at
the
the
meetings
that
we
do
and
the
community
meetings
and
i
see
these
little
girls
and
boys
sometimes
even
brought
by
their
fathers
and
they
bring
them
to
me
and
i
talk
to
them
during
these
events
and
they
smile
and
they're
full
of
joy
and
their
fathers
tell
them
see
don't
you
ever
listen
and
let
anybody
ever
tell
you
what
you
can
or
cannot
be
you
have
to
believe
in

can

unburdened

has
been

you
very

mayor
buttigieg
buttigieg
you
know
as
a
military
officer
serving
under
don't
ask
don't
tell
and
as
an
elected
official
in
the
state
of
indiana
when
mike
pence
was
governor
at
a
certain
point
when
it
came
to
professional
setbacks
i
had
to
wonder
whether
just
acknowledging
who
i
was
was
going
to
be
the
ultimate
career-ending
professional
setback
i
came
back
from
the
deployment
and
realized
that
you
only
get
to
live
one
life
and
i
was
not
interested
in
not
knowing
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
love
any
longer
so
i
just
came
out
i
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
professional
setback
it
would
be
especially
because
inconveniently
it
was
an
election
year
in
my
socially
conservative
community
what
happened
was
that
when
i
trusted
voters
to
judge
me
based
on
the
job
that
i
did
for
them
they
decided
to
trust
me
and
re-elected
me
with
percent
of
the
vote
and
what
i
learned
was
that
trust
can
be
reciprocated
and
that
part
of
how
you
can
win
and
deserve
to
win
is
to
know
what's
worth
more
to
you
than
winning
and
i
think
that's
what
we
need
in
the
presidency
right
now
we
have
to
know
what
we
are
about
and
this
election
is
not
about
any
of
us
up
here
it
is
not
about
this
president
even
though
it's
hard
to
talk
of
anything
else
some
days
it's
about
the
people
who
trust
us
with
their
lives
a
kid
wondering
if
we're
actually
going
to
make
their
schools
safe
when
they've
learned
active
shooter
drills
before
they've
learned
to
read
a
generation
wondering
we
will
actually
get
the
job
done
on
climate
change
and
if
we
hold
to
that
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
each
of
us
professionally
together
we
will
win
a
better
era
for
our
country
stephanopoulos
mayor

thank
you

mr
yang
yang
i
was
an
unhappy
lawyer
for
five
whole
months
and
i
left
to
start
a
business
and
i'm
going
to
share
with
you
all
one
of
the
secrets
to
entrepreneurship
if
you
want
to
start
something
tell
everyone
you
know
you're
going
to
do
it
and
then
you
don't
have
a
choice
you
put
your
heart
and
soul
into
that
and
even
though
i
did
that
my
company
flopped
had
its
mini-rise
and
maximum
fall
i
lost
investors
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
still
owed
in
school
debt
my
parents
still
told
people
i
was
a
lawyer
it
was
a
little
easier
so
i
remember
lying
on
my
floor
looking
up
wondering
how
did
it
come
to
this
eventually
i
picked
myself
back
up
i
kept
working
in
small
growth
companies
for
another
years
and
eventually
had
some
success
then
after
i
did
have
some
success
i
still
remembered
how
hard
it
was
how
isolating
it
was
how
it
feels
like
your
friends
no
longer
want
to
spend
time
with
you
and
so
i
spent
seven
years
starting
and
running
a
nonprofit
that
helped
train
young
entrepreneurs
around
the
country
including
sean
nguyen
ph
who's
here
in
the
audience
tonight
who
left
his
gilded
wall
street
job
to
become
a
food
entrepreneur
in
san
antonio
sean
i
hope
i
made
the
process
a
little
bit
easier
for
you
than
it
was
for
me
but
the
goal
of
my
campaign
is
to
make
this
an
economy
that
allows
us
to
live
our
human
values
and
aspirations
stephanopoulos
thank
you
thank
you
mr
yang
applause
senator
booker
booker
so
my
biggest
professional
setback
is
embarrassing
because
a
lot
of
folks
know
about
it
i
with
a
bunch
of
tenant
leaders
in
newark
new
jersey
in
took
on
the
political
machine
and
boy
did
they
fight
back
i
had
tires
on
my
car
slashed
our
campaign
offices
were
broken
into
my
phones
were
tapped
it
became
a
spectacle
and
we
lost
that
election
and
here's
a
bit
of
advice
to
everybody
if
you're
going
to
have
a
spectacular
failure
have
a
documentary
team
there
to
capture
it
because
it
made
for
an
oscar-nominated
documentary
called
street
fight
but
then
unfortunately
another
setback
it
lost
in
the
oscars
to
a
movie
called
march
of
the
dagnab
penguins
for
crying
out
loud
laughter
the
people
in
my
community
living
in
the
projects
told
me
don't
give
up
on
the
people
and
the
people
won't
give
up
on
you
create
bigger
and
bolder
coalitions
and
you're
going
to
win
and
you
know
what
we
came
back
four
years
later
and
won
the
largest
lopsided
victory
in
our
city's
history
but
more
than
that
the
lesson
was
there
we
didn't
give
up
we
were
taking
on
america's
toughest
problems
from
crime
to
poverty
and
we
transformed
our
city
creating
tens
of
thousands
of
new
jobs
the
biggest
economic
expansion
in
our
city
and
as
i
said
before
turned
around
our
school
system
there's
more
work
to
do
but
i
haven't
given
up
on
the
people
i
still
live
in
that
community
but
this
is
a
big
lesson
my
staff
and
my
friends
and
my
community
told
me
if
you
want
to
go
fast
you
may
have
won
the
mayor's
race
but
that's
not
what
life
is
about
there's
an
old
african
saying
that
says
if
you
want
to
go
fast
go
alone
but
if
you
want
to
go
far
go
together
the
lesson
i
learned
of
resilience
is
to
trust
people
because
the
power
of
the
people
is
always
greater
than
the
people
in
power
and
the
test
of
america
right
now
is
not
a
referendum
on
donald
trump
it's
a
referendum
on
us
and
who
we
are
and
who
we're
going
to
be
together
we
need
to
use
this
moment
in
history
to
unite
in
common
cause
and
common
purpose
and
then
there's
nothing
we
can't
do
together
as
a
nation

everything
that
i've
learned
about
resilience
i've
learned
from
my
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
in
the
face
of
this
act
of
terror
that
was
directed
at
our
community
in
large
part
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
killed
people
and
injured
many
more
we
were
not
defeated
by
that
nor
were
we
defined
by
that
the
very
thing
that
drew
that
killer
to
us
is
the
very
thing
that
helps
us
set
the
example
for
the
rest
of
this
country
we
don't
see
our
differences
as
disqualifying
or
dangerous
we
see
them
as
foundational
to
our
success
to
our
strength
and
to
our
security
and
to
our
safety
yesterday
i
was
visiting
with
one
of
those
victims
he's
the
head
coach
of
the
fusion
this
is
a
girls
soccer
team
of
and
year-old
girls
his
name
is
luis
he
was
shot
in
the
legs
multiple
times
he
was
shot
in
the
side
multiple
times
he's
still
healing
from
his
wounds
in
the
hospital
but
from
his
hospital
bed
he's
still
trying
to
coach
the
fusion
girls
soccer
team
memo
his
co-coach
is
still
fighting
for
his
life
right
now
at
del
sol
hospital
those
two
men
jessica
and
marcella
ph
their
wives
they
exemplify
resilience
to
me
and
when
we
end
this
scourge
of
gun
violence
in
this
country
when
we
finally
confront
the
racism
that
exists
in
america
when
we're
defined
not
by
our
fears
but
instead
by
our
aspirations
and
our
ambitions
it
will
be
in
large
part
i
think
thanks
to
the
example
that
el
paso
has
set
stephanopoulos
congressman
thank
you
senator
klobuchar
applause
klobuchar
thank
you
my
challenges
and
resilience
have
brought
me
up
here
i
grew
up
with
a
dad
who
struggled
with
alcoholism
his
whole
life
and
after
his
third
dwi
he
had
a
choice
between
jail
and
treatment
he
chose
treatment
with
his
faith
with
his
friends
with
our
family
and
in
his
words
he
was
pursued
by
grace
and
that
made
me
interested
in
public
service
because
i
feel
like
everyone
should
have
that
same
right
to
be
pursued
by
grace
i
then
got
married
my
husband's
out
there
somewhere
hopefully
smiling
and
our
daughter
when
our
daughter
was
born
i
had
this
expectation
we're
going
to
have
this
perfect
perfect
birth
and
she
was
really
sick
and
she
couldn't
swallow
and
she
was
in
and
out
of
hospitals
for
a
year-and-a-half
but
when
she
was
born
they
had
a
rule
in
place
that
you
got
kicked
out
of
the
hospital
in
hours
she
was
in
intensive
care
and
i
was
kicked
out
and
i
thought
this
could
never
happen
to
any
other
mom
again
so
i
went
to
the
legislature
our
state
legislator
not
an
elected
official
a
mom
and
i
advocated
for
one
of
the
first
laws
in
the
country
guaranteeing
new
moms
and
their
babies
a
hour
hospital
stay
and
when
they
tried
to
delay
the
implementation
of
that
law
i
brought
six
pregnant
friends
to
the
conference
committee
so
they
outnumbered
the
lobbyists
to
and
when
they
said
when
should
it
take
place
they
all
raised
their
hands
and
said
now
that
is
what
motivated
me
to
go
into
public
service
and
when
i
got
to
that
gridlock
of
washington
d.c.
i
got
to
work
and
pass
over
bills
and
i
know
a
lot
of
my
friends
here
from
the
left
but
remember
i
am
from
the
middle
of
the
country
and
i
believe
if
we're
going
to
get
things
done
that
we
have
to
have
someone
leading
the
ticket
with
grit
someone
who's
going
to
not
just
change
the
policies
but
change
the
tone
in
the
country
and
someone
who
believes
in
america
and
believes
it
from
their
heart
because
of
where
they
came
from
that
everyone
should
have
that
same
opportunity
stephanopoulos
senator
thank
you
secretary
castro
castro
and
thank
you
george
to
jorge
to
linsey
and
to
david
and
to
all
of
y'all
for
tuning
in
tonight
in
many
ways
i
shouldn't
be
here
on
this
stage
you
know
castro
is
my
mother's
name
and
was
my
grandmother's
name
before
her
i
grew
up
in
a
single-parent
household
on
the
west
side
of
san
antonio
going
to
the
public
schools
eventually
my
brother
joaquin
and
i
became
the
first
in
our
family
to
become
professionals
and
when
i
got
home
i
took
a
job
at
the
biggest
law
firm
in
town
i
was
making
a
year
in
the
year
a
few
months
later
i
got
elected
to
the
san
antonio
city
council
and
the
city
council
at
the
time
was
only
paying
a
year
so
everybody
had
another
job
and
my
job
was
at
the
law
firm
well
a
few
months
after
i
got
elected
the
law
firm
got
a
client
and
the
client
wanted
those
of
us
on
the
city
council
to
vote
for
a
land
deal
the
land
deal
was
that
they
wanted
to
build
a
golf
course
over
our
water
supply
because
we
relied
on
an
underground
aquifer
i
didn't
think
the
environmental
protection
plan
was
strong
enough
so
i
wanted
to
vote
against
it
and
my
constituents
wanted
me
to
vote
against
it
but
under
the
ethics
rules
for
lawyers
in
texas
because
believe
it
or
not
lawyers
have
ethics
rules
you
can't
just
go
against
the
interest
of
a
client
so
i
was
stuck
on
the
one
hand
i
wanted
to
do
the
right
thing
on
the
other
hand
my
livelihood
my
student
loans
my
new
house
payment
my
car
payment
depended
on
me
shutting
up
being
conflicted
out
so
one
day
i
walked
into
my
law
firm
and
i
quit
my
job
and
then
i
went
and
i
voted
against
that
land
deal
on
the
city
council
applause
and
you
know
it
was
the
first
test
that
i
had
and
i
think
back
to
that
because
oftentimes
we
think
of
politics
and
you
think
of
politics
as
dirty
or
corrupting
i
wondered
before
i
went
in
it
whether
it
was
change
who
i
was
and
i
was
proud
that
when
that
first
test
came
that
i
stood
up
for
the
people
that
i
was
there
to
represent
and
not
for
big
special
interests
there's
nobody
that
gets
tested
more
in
a
position
of
public
trust
than
the
president
of
the
united
states
this
president
has
failed
that
test
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
if
you
elect
me
president
i
won't
i
won't
serve
anybody
except
you
and
your
family
and
together
we
can
create
an
american
that's
better
than
ever
thank
you
very
much
stephanopoulos
thank
you
secretary
castro
thank
you
to
all
of
our
candidates
it
was
a
great
debate
i
think
we
learned
a
lot
tonight
thanks
to
you
thanks
to
texas
southern
university
for
hosting
us
tonight
it
was
a
great
crowd
as
well
tonight
thanks
to
you
applause
thanks
to
everyone
at
home
the
debate
is
over
our
coverage
continues
with
tom
llamas
end
