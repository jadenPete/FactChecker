migrants
passing
through

must
seek
asylum
there
before
asking
u.s.
el
salvador
isn't
safe
for
its
own
citizens
to
deem
it
safe
for
refugees
seeking
asylum
would
be
laughable
if
it
wasn't
so
dangerous
one
advocate
said
washington
the
trump
administration
will
now
require
asylum-seekers
who
pass
through
el
salvador
on
their
way
to
the
u.s.
to
seek
asylum
in
the
violent
central
american
country
first
the
latest
in
a
series
of
steps
to
stymie
the
efforts
of
migrants
seeking
asylum
at
the
u.s.
border
acting
secretary
of
homeland
security
kevin
mcaleenan
signed
the
agreement
on
friday
with
el
salvador's
foreign
minister
alexandra
hill
under
the
accord
the
u.s.
will
work
with
the
united
nations
to
improve
the
system
for
claiming
asylum
in
el
salvador
hill
emphasized
that
the
u.s.
would
be
helping
el
salvador
increase
its
security
and
fight
against
gang
violence
as
part
of
the
agreement
el
salvador
has
not
been
able
to
give
our
people
enough
security
or
opportunities
so
that
they
can
stay
and
thrive
said
hill
adding
that
el
salvador
needs
help
fighting
gang
violence
as
well
as
investment
from
the
united
states
and
other
parts
of
the
world
mcaleenan
said
the
agreement
would
further
u.s.
efforts
to
provide
opportunities
to
seek
protection
for
political
racial
religious
or
social
group
persecution
but
immigration
rights
groups
say
the
agreement
will
make
things
harder
for
asylum-seekers
crossing
through
el
salvador
which
has
one
of
the
highest
homicide
rates
in
the
world
and
those
crossing
through
it
the
deal
would
primarily
affect
migrants
from
countries
south
of
el
salvador
such
as
nicaragua
and
venezuela
el
salvador
isn't
a
safe
place
for
its
own
citizens
so
to
deem
it
safe
for
refugees
seeking
asylum
would
be
simply
laughable
if
it
wasn't
so
dangerous
and
deadly
this
agreement
not
only
belittles
the
dangers
these
vulnerable
people
face
but
it
threatens
the
safety
of
refugees
fleeing
from
cuba
nicaragua
venezuela
and
other
countries
said
eleanor
acer
of
human
rights
first
previously
the
trump
administration
has
said
immigrants
passing
through
guatemala
which
is
north
of
el
salvador
must
first
attempt
to
claim
asylum
there
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
protections
in
the
u.s.
but
that
deal
has
yet
to
be
implemented
mexico
has
refused
to
sign
such
a
deal
although
the
trump
administration
has
said
it
may
return
migrants
who
pass
through
any
country
where
they
could
claim
asylum
the
supreme
court
recently
ruled
the
administration
can
go
forward
with
this
policy
while
the
issue
plays
out
in
lower
courts
record
numbers
of
asylum-seekers
from
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
crossed
into
the
u.s.
this
year
overwhelming
courts
border
agents
and
detention
space
those
numbers
have
begun
to
wane
slightly
which
law
enforcement
officials
attribute
to
seasonal
affects
and
a
policy
that
forces
asylum-seekers
to
wait
in
mexico
until
their
day
in
u.s.

courts
