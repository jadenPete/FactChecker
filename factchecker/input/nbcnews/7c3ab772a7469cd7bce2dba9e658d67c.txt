this
pelosi
threatens
new
stage
of
probe
as
trump
admin
stonewalls
whistleblower
complaint
pelosi
said
that
any
further
obstruction
from
the
administration
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
sunday
assailed
the
trump
administration's
efforts
to
block
a
whistleblower
complaint
involving
president
donald
trump's
apparent
effort
to
have
ukraine
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
family
in
a
letter
to
colleagues
pelosi
said
the
administration
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
if
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
fails
to
provide
the
complaint
when
he
testifies
in
front
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
the
complaint
reportedly
centers
around
trump's
july
conversation
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
during
which
trump
is
accused
of
pressuring
zelensky
to
investigate
biden's
son
hunter's
role
at
a
ukrainian
energy
company
pelosi's
letter
comes
as
frustration
is
increasing
among
lawmakers
they
are
frustrated
not
only
with
what
they
see
as
the
president's
obstruction
of
the
congressional
investigation
but
also
with
the
slow-moving
probe
into
him
lawmakers
and
aides
say
frustration
escalated
after
former
trump
aide
corey
lewandowski's
day
of
mostly
stonewalling
on
friday
during
a
meeting
of
judiciary
committee
democrats
two
democratic
aides
said
committee
leadership
tried
to
calm
members
who
were
angry
that
the
panel
didn't
hold
him
in
contempt
on
the
spot
during
the
hearing
as
the
new
york
times
and
others
reported
trump's
phone
call
led
to
a
whistleblower
complaint
which
is
now
at
the
center
of
a
standoff
between
congress
and
the
administration
the
administration
has
refused
to
turn
over
to
congress
details
of
the
complaint
though
the
washington
post
has
reported
that
the
allegation
centers
on
a
promise
trump
made
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
questioned
sunday
that
if
trump's
conversation
involved
no
wrongdoing
why
doesn't
the
president
simply
release
the
transcript
of
that
call
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
whistleblower
complaint
is
on
this
allegation
but
if
it
is
and
even
if
it
isn't
why
doesn't
the
president
just
say
release
the
whistleblower
complaint
schiff
told
cnn's
state
of
the
union
clearly
he's
afraid
for
the
public
to
see
either
one
of
those
things
and
we're
determined
to
make
sure
the
public
does
the
nation
is
protected
administration
officials
said
sunday
that
such
transcripts
are
not
released
so
that
foreign
leaders
and
the
president
can
discuss
matters
candidly
but
schiff
said
there
should
be
no
privilege
afforded
to
discussions
that
involve
potential
corruption
or
criminality
this
would
be
the
most
profound
violation
of
the
presidential
oath
of
office
certainly
during
this
presidency
which
says
a
lot
but
perhaps
just
about
during
any
presidency
schiff
said
there
is
no
privilege
that
covers
corruption
no
privilege
to
engage
in
underhanded
discussions
schiff
added
that
the
only
remedy
to
such
behavior
is
impeachment
former
secretary
of
state
john
kerry
speaking
with
cbs's
face
the
nation
called
the
push
for
ukraine
to
probe
biden
a
fundamental
profound
and
deeply
concerning
abuse
of
power
adding
it
was
unprecedented
and
that
the
transcript
should
be
released
to
show
whether
trump
colluded
with
a
foreign
government
to
influence
the
upcoming
presidential
election
on
nbc's
meet
the
press
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
said
that
if
the
president
is
asking
another
foreign
leader
to
interfere
in
an
american
election
then
there
has
to
be
consequences
murphy
a
member
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
recently
met
with
zelensky
in
kiev
he
said
the
ukrainian
president
didn't
understand
whether
this
was
an
official
government
position
these
requests
to
investigate
the
former
vice
president
some
republicans
also
expressed
concern
about
the
phone
call
sen
pat
toomey
r-pa
told
meet
the
press
that
while
he
didn't
know
the
context
of
the
phone
call
between
trump
and
zelensky
or
what
was
said
it
is
not
appropriate
for
any
candidate
to
ask
for
assistance
from
a
foreign
government
sen
mitt
romney
r-utah
said
in
a
sunday
tweet
that
if
trump
asked
or
pressured
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
his
political
rival
either
directly
or
through
his
personal
attorney
it
would
be
troubling
in
the
extreme
critical
for
the
facts
to
come
out
he
said
meanwhile
trump
and
his
allies
sought
to
deny
any
wrongdoing
by
the
president
responding
to
romney
in
a
text
message
to
nbc
news
the
president's
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
said
romney
is
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened
to
him
when
that
candy
lady
whacked
him
around
in
the
debate
with
then-president
barack
obama
referencing
a
moment
from
a
presidential
debate
moderated
by
former
cnn
anchor
candy
crowley
giuliani
said
the
ukrainian
efforts
were
simply
what
presidents
do
who
care
about
the
selling
of
public
office
and
on
the
sunday
show
circuit
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
told
state
of
the
union
that
he
would
not
speculate
on
what
trump
discussed
with
zelensky
though
he
said
he
didn't
expect
there
were
any
issues
whatsoever
mnuchin
told
host
jake
tapper
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
president
pressured
adding
later
there
is
really
no
issue
here
releasing
the
transcript
of
that
phone
call
would
be
a
terrible
precedent
he
said
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
abc's
this
week
that
if
biden
behaved
inappropriately
if
he
was
protecting
his
son
and
intervened
with
the
ukrainian
leadership
in
a
way
that
was
corrupt
i
do
think
we
need
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
he
said
he'd
allow
the
white
house
to
explain
why
they
have
not
released
the
transcript
of
the
phone
call
calling
it
rare
that
such
a
transcript
would
be
released
trump
told
reporters
sunday
that
he
did
discuss
biden
with
zelensky
but
said
there
was
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
the
call
he
told
reporters
later
sunday
that
he
might
provide
a
transcript
of
the
conversation
to
a
respected
source
the
conversation
i
had
was
largely
congratulatory
with
largely
corruption
all
of
the
corruption
taking
place
and
largely
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine
and
ukraine
has
got
a
lot
of
problems
trump
said
the
new
president
is
saying
that
he's
going
to
be
able
to
rid
the
country
of
corruption
and
i
said
that
would
be
a
great
thing
we
had
a
great
conversation
the
president
also
said
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
there
was
nothing
and
it
was
a
perfect
conversation
in
a
campaign
memo
sent
sunday
afternoon
biden's
deputy
campaign
manager
kate
bedingfield
wrote
that
the
ukraine
episode
showed
trump
and
his
campaign
are
terrified
of
facing
vice
president
biden
in
a
general
election
the
president
and
his
lackeys
are
so
terrified
of
that
prospect
and
have
abandoned
any
pretense
of
having
an
iota
of
truth
on
their
side
as
they
flail
and
try
to
distract
from
what
may
be
the
greatest
presidential
malfeasance
since
watergate
that
they
fell
all
over
themselves
lying
on
the
sunday
shows
today
she
added
the
president's
focus
on
biden
and
ukraine
comes
amid
giuliani's
monthslong
effort
to
get
ukraine
to
further
investigate
the
former
vice
president
an
effort
which
was
aided
by
the
state
department
as
nbc
news
reported
last
month
the
push
centers
on
biden's
call
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
including
removing
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
one
of
the
cases
that
shokin
was
investigating
involved
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
at
the
time
included
biden's
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
politifact
meanwhile
reported
that
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
house
democrats
have
already
announced
an
investigation
into
giuliani's
ukrainian
efforts
on
wednesday
trump
is
set
to
meet
face
to
face
with
zelensky
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
in
the
weeks
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
became
public
the
trump
administration
froze
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
for
unclear
reasons
then
just
before
democrats
revealed
the
existence
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
administration
released
the
hold
on
the
ukrainian
military
aid
on
saturday
ukrainian
foreign
minister
vadym
prystaiko
said
he
didn't
think
trump
pressured
zelensky
a
former
comedian
during
their
july
phone
call
i
know
what
the
conversation
was
about
and
i
think
there
was
no
pressure
he
said
there
was
talk
conversations
are
different
leaders
have
the
right
to
discuss
any
problems
that
exist
this
conversation
was
long
friendly
and
it
touched
on
a
lot
of
questions
including
those
requiring
serious
answers
speaking
to
reporters
in
iowa
on
saturday
biden
said
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
