aimed
at
opening
the
way
to
the
withdrawal
of

from
afghanistan
after
years
of
war
the
subpoena
reflects
growing
frustration
in
congress
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
about
the
administration's
reluctance
to
discuss
the
negotiations
at
an
open
hearing
or
in

a
year
of
negotiations
the

khalilzad
a
former
ambassador
to
afghanistan
who
has
rarely
spoken
publicly
about
the

president
trump
called
off
negotiations
with

he
said
he
had
planned

representatives
and
the
afghan
government
at
the
camp
david
presidential
retreat
on
monday
he
said
the
talks
with
the
insurgents
were
dead
engel
said
he
issued
the
subpoena
because
he
said
the
state
department
failed
to
respond
to
numerous
requests
for
briefings
by
the
presidential
envoy
more
than
american
troops
have
died
in
afghanistan
and
i'm
fed
up
with
this
administration
keeping
congress
and
the
american
people
in
the
dark
on
the
peace
process
and
how
we're
going
to
bring
this
long
war
to
a
close
engel
said
in
a
statement
for
months
we
haven't
been
able
to
get
answers
on
the
afghanistan
peace
plan
and
now
the
president
is
saying
the
plan
is
dead
engel
added
we
need
to
hear
directly
from
the
administration's
point
person
on
afghanistan
to
understand
how
this
process
went
off
the
rails
engel
said
the
state
department
declined
requests
from
his
committee
in
february
april
and
earlier
this
month
before
trump
called
off
the
talks
the
proposed
deal
between
the
united
states
and
the
taliban
outlined
a
timetable
for
the
phased
withdrawal
of
u.s.
troops
in
return
for
the
militants
agreeing
to
hold
peace
talks
with
the
afghan
government
and
promising
to
prevent
the
country
from
being
used
as
a
staging
ground
for
terrorist
attacks
according
to
current
and
former
u.s.
