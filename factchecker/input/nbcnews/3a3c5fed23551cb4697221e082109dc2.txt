thursday
with
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
and
others
promising
bold
action
on
an
issue
that
has
become
a
defining
one
for
democrats
ahead

in
total
presidential
candidates

the
two-day
town-hall
style
event
taking
place
at
georgetown
university's
institute
of
politics
and
public
service
in
washington
the

hayes
and
ali
velshi
comes
amid
a
week-long
series
of
climate
coverage
from
nbc
news
msnbc
telemundo
and
nbc
news
digital
activists
lawmakers
and
presidential
candidates
such
as
washington
gov
jay
inslee
who
ended
his
campaign
last
month
have
pushed
the
democratic
national
committee
to
hold
a
climate-specific
primary
debate
so
far
the
dnc
has
not
agreed
to
do
so
as
some
pressure
builds
for
candidates
to
zero-in
on
the
issue
cnn
hosted
a
similar
climate
event
earlier
this
month
hayes
and
velshi
interviewed
the
participating

former
rep
john
delaney
d-md
rep
tim
ryan
d-ohio
and
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
castro
promoted
his
sweeping
trillion
climate
plan
that
he
said
would
result
in
the
country
having
net-zero
emissions
in
the
next
years
his
plan
calls
for
a
public-private
partnership
and
he
said
it
would
result
in
million
new
jobs
i
believe
we
can
reach
our
goals
if
this
is
all
hands
on
deck
all
across
the
federal
government
and
private
sector
castro
said
we
have
to
begin
immediately
a
key
component
of
his
plan
is
undoing
the
damage
the
trump
administration
is
doing
by
loosening
environment
regulations
castro
said
the
next
president
is
going
to
have
spend
the
next
two
and
half
years
rolling
back
the
bad
things
this
administration
has
done
he
said
adding
that
he'd
have
people
who
believe
in
science
leading
the
fight
against
climate
change
the
former
san
antonio
texas
mayor
would
also
create
a
new
category
of
refugee
climate
refugees
for
people
in
other
countries
who
are
being
displaced
by
global
changes
he
cited
a
report
that
found
over
million
people
could
be
displaced
worldwide
by
the
former
housing
secretary
was
optimistic
that
the
country
would
turn
its
back
on
the
trump
era
texas
is
going
to
go
blue
in
so
is
arizona
he
said
ryan
focused
on
how
an
aggressive
climate
policy
would
help
bring
back
manufacturing
jobs
to
struggling
industrial
and
rural
areas
let's
get
away
from
the
left-right
conversation
and
get
into
the
new
and
better
conversation
the
ohio
congressman
said
he
said
he
would
tie
financial
incentives
with
environmental
incentives
in
a
bid
to
spur
investment
and
invest
federal
funding
into
infrastructure
to
provide
jobs
for
displaced
coal
and
fossil
fuel
workers
people
can
start
making
money
from
this
stuff
ryan
said
touting
the
success
he's
already
seen
around
the
country
with
regenerative
agriculture
which
captures
carbon
from
the
air
enriches
the
soil
and
reduces
flood
risks
increased
reliance
on
solar
and
wind
power
would
lead
to
more
manufacturing
as
would
building
more
electric
cars
and
charging
stations
he
said
there's
a
new
economy
that's
ready
to
bust
out
and
is
ready
to
go
ryan
said
unlike
some
of
the
other
candidates
he
said
he
would
not
look
to
immediately
ban
fracking
noting
it's
brought
a
number
of
jobs
to
his
home
state
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
power
the
country
in
two
years
on
renewables
he
said
i
think
natural
gas
has
got
to
be
the
bridge
the
former
congressman
from
maryland
took
aim
at
trump
criticizing
the
current
administration's
economic
isolationism
and
calling
for
a
return
to
the
old-fashioned
u.s.
business
of
having
alliances
i'll
sign
us
back
into
paris
before
i
sit
down
in
the
chair
in
the
oval
office
he
promised
referring
to
the
landmark
paris
agreement
that
set
goals
for
a
coalition
of
nations
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
limit
global
warming
trump
withdrew
the
u.s.
from
the
agreement
in
delaney
outlined
a
three-point
climate
change
plan
that
would
aim
to
achieve
net
zero
carbon
emissions
by
promote
the
global
development
of
clean
technologies
and
remove
percent
of
the
atmosphere's
carbon
dioxide
through
a
midwest
pipeline
which
he
referred
to
as
the
co
thruway
the
cornerstone
of
his
plan
according
to
delaney
is
a
carbon
fee
and
dividend
that
would
place
a
trillion
dollar
tax
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
redistribute
the
money
back
to
american
citizens
he
likened
this
model
to
the
alaska
permanent
fund
which
pays
an
annual
dividend
to
alaskan
citizens
from
investment
earnings
on
mineral
royalties
delaney
also
envisioned
the
u.s.
leading
a
paris
a
global
consortium
in
which
countries
would
contribute
intellectual
capital
and
build
the
energy
solutions
that
are
needed
for
the
developing
world
the
vermont
senator
said
that
he
would
be
the
enemy
of
the
fossil
fuel
industry
because
unlike
trump
i
do
believe
in
science
he
said
that
one
of
his
first
acts
a
president
would
include
signing
an
executive
order
that
would
end
fossil
fuel
extraction
on
public
land
which
he
said
would
swiftly
and
severely
disrupt
the
industry
sanders
also
made
the
case
that
as
president
he
would
visit
states
in
which
fossil
fuels
are
dominant
such
as
coal
in
west
virginia
and
mobilize
its
residents
around
the
issue
i
intend
to
be
commander-in-chief
of
the
military
but
i
will
also
be
the
organizer
in
chief
he
said
we're
going
to
help
rebuild
states
like
west
virginia
and
states
all
over
this
country
sanders
said
that
one
of
his
plans
include
job
training
for
people
working
in
industries
that
contribute
to
climate
change
and
transition
many
to
green
jobs
through
job
training
he
said
his
plan
would
also
include
providing
health
care
and
other
services
to
ease
the
shift
we
are
paying
a
lot
of
attention
to
those
workers
but
we
also
understand
that
we
are
going
to
create
some
million
good-paying
green
jobs
he
said
sanders
also
pointed
out
his
plan
would
also
combat
environmental
pollution
in
the
air
and
water
particularly
in
economically
struggling
areas
of
the
country
where
many
minorities
live
i
happen
to
believe
what
the
scientist
are
telling
us
and
that
means
if
we
are
going
to
save
the
planet
we
have
to
be
extremely
bold
and
extremely
aggressive
he
said
sanders
made
the
case
that
there
needs
a
world
war
ii
type
of
mobilization
in
america
to
fight
climate
change
across
the
country
and
the
globe
he
said
that
he
would
welcome
more
refugees
into
the
country
who
have
been
displaced
because
of
the
effects
of
climate
change
these
type
of
extreme
weather
disturbances
hitting
us
more
and
more
frequently
with
greater
intensity
think
about
people
all
over
the
world
driven
from
their
homes
because
they
can't
grow
crops
anymore
they
can't
find
drinking
water
they
are
going
to
go
elsewhere
he
said
we
have
to
welcome
people
all
over
the
world
i
mean
we
are
talking
about
god
knows
how
many
of
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
people
who
are
going
to
be
dispossessed
as
a
result
of
climate
change
it's
a
huge
issue
he
also
said
that
as
president
he
would
sanction
countries
that
do
not
take
steps
to
reduce
emissions
that
contribute
to
climate
change
williamson
told
the
audience
it's
time
for
some
radical
truth-telling
in
america
including
on
the
issue
of
climate
change
the
best-selling
self-help
author
made
the
case
for
a
revolution
to
push
back
against
corporations
and
fossil
fuel-friendly
lawmakers
to
combat
the
issue
i
want
to
tell
the
american
people
it's
as
bad
as
you
fear
and
we
are
going
to
get
through
this
because
were
american
and
we're
going
to
have
a
season
of
repair
she
said
we
are
going
to
mobilize
and
it's
not
during
wwii
it
wasn't
democrats
versus
republicans
left
versus
right
we
are
all
americans
and
we
are
going
to
mobilize
but
she
also
said
a
williamson
administration
would
work
with
oil
gas
and
fossil-fuel
industries
to
combat
the
warming
of
the
planet
there
is
more
money
to
be
made
in
green
energy
there
is
more
money
to
be
made
in
green
jobs
she
said
invoking
year-old
swedish
climate
activist
greta
thunberg
williamson
also
made
the
case
for
a
one-year
mandatory
national
service
for
young
americans
ages
to
to
work
on
climate
issues
i
wanna
go
to
washington
and
be
a
grown-up
greta
thunberg
she
said
adding
that
she
wants
to
be
a
president
with
moral
influence
and
the
highest
ideals
of
humanitarian
concern
she
said
that
it
takes
american
voters
to
stand
up
against
both
parties
so
that
washington
can
take
the
issue
seriously
she
called
president
donald
trump
is
an
opportunistic
infection
and
he
won
the
presidency
because
american
voters
had
become
disengaged
from
the
political
process
she
also
pushed
back
against
the
assertion
that
she
is
anti-science
because
of
a
now-deleted
tweet
in
which
she
suggested
prayer
could
deter
hurricane
dorian
i'm
jewish
i
go
to
the
doctor
there's
nothing
anti-doctor
about
me
there's
nothing
anti-science
about
me
she
said
mock
and
make
fun
of
everybody
who
believes
that
god
is
powerful
i
am
a
woman
who
believes
in
god
it
doesn't
mean
i
don't
believe
in
science
it
doesn't
mean
i
lost
some
brain
cells
doesn't
mean
i'm
less
intelligent
it's
already
too
late
to
curb
some
of
the
warming
that
will
affect
the
earth
yang
said
adding
that
decades
ago
would
have
been
the
right
time
to
deal
with
a
changing
climate
the
world
will
continue
to
warm
more
areas
will
become
uninhabitable
and
there
is
nothing
humans
can
do
to
stop
it
he
said
still
yang
said
he
wants
to
address
the
environment
with
big
moves
and
called
it
problem
a
that
the
u.s.
needs
to
address
we
should've
been
doing
this
work
years
ago
but
the
second
best
time
is
now
he
said
yang
has
proposed
taxing
carbon
production
by
corporations
subsidizing
and
investing
in
nuclear
power
alternatives
and
passing
a
constitutional
amendment
to
safeguard
the
environment
yang
on
thursday
called
climate
change
the
clearest
existential
threat
to
our
way
of
life
and
our
entire
species
adding
that
climate
change
and
automation
are
closely
tied
together
for
him
yang
has
proposed
a
sort
of
universal
basic
income
he
calls
a
freedom
dividend
which
would
amount
to
a
monthly
payment
to
every
american
adult
aimed
at
offsetting
some
of
the
disruption
caused
by
a
changing
economy
bennet
said
climate
change
should
be
treated
as
the
biggest
problem
facing
society
at
the
moment
not
just
one
problem
among
many
still
the
colorado
senator
repeatedly
stressed
the
need
to
shape
climate
policy
in
a
way
that
will
appeal
in
swing
districts
and
states
democrats
can
offer
no
compromise
on
the
science
but
we
have
to
produce
a
set
of
policy
choices
for
the
american
people
that
can
allow
us
to
win
these
races
and
produce
an
enduring
coalition
to
pass
climate
legislation
bennet
told
hayes
he
noted
the
importance
particularly
in
of
not
losing
the
economic
debate
on
climate
change
and
said
too
often
democrats
are
painted
as
anti-jobs
and
anti-infrastructure
with
their
environmental
efforts
we
can't
lose
an
economic
debate
to
a
climate
denier
he
said
pointing
to
trump
he
should
never
have
won
that
economic
argument
and
he
did
if
elected
president
bennet
said
he
would
convene
all
people
we
needed
to
convene
to
begin
to
draft
the
legislative
plan
on
climate
change
if
after
nine
months
the
senate
was
unable
to
or
refused
to
pass
such
legislation
bennet
said
he
would
use
the
authority
within
his
power
to
begin
addressing
climate
change
through
executive
action
the
two
biggest
challenges
with
climate
policy
is
transitioning
the
economy
which
he
said
he
is
completely
confident
will
be
able
to
happen
and
whether
our
democracy
is
up
to
this
task
bennet
was
much
less
optimistic
on
the
latter
point
