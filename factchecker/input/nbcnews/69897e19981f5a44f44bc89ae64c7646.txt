race
carries
unlikely
hangover
from

the
closely-watched
special
u.s.
house
election
being
held
here
tuesday
is
taking
place
in
the
shadow
of
a
political
scandal
that
according
to
the
candidates
is
having
a
real
impact
on
the
race
but
this
time
around
the
issue
is
not
the
illegal
ballot
harvesting
that
marred
last
year's
contest
it's
the
fact
the
one
of
the
candidates
has
been
effectively
running
for
over
two
years
democratic
candidate
dan
mccready
likes
to
tell
his
supporters
that
he
began
running
for
the
th
congressional
district
seat
when
his
wife
laura
was
pregnant
with
their
fourth
child
their
daughter
recently
celebrated
her
second
birthday
the
republican
candidate
state
sen
dan
bishop
agrees
saying
that
mccready's
marathon
campaign
is
why
the
race
is
by
all
accounts
neck-and-neck
in
a
district
that
president
donald
trump
won
by
points
in
the
media
sorta
relentlessly
asks
me
well
why
is
this
race
close
and
i
have
to
remind
them
dan
mccready
has
been
running
for
months
bishop
told
a
small
gathering
of
supporters
recently
at
a
refurbished
barn
in
union
county
outside
of
charlotte
mccready's
nearly
two-and-a-half
year
campaign
and
bishop's
late
entrance
into
the
race
is
the
result
of
a
mail-in
absentee
ballot
scheme
that
led
the
north
carolina
state
board
of
elections
to
throw
out
the
results
of
the
election
after
an
investigation
and
a
four-day
trial
the
board
called
for
a
new
election
then-republican
candidate
mark
harris
dropped
his
candidacy
after
admitting
to
misstatements
during
the
emotional
hearing
that
led
to
a
new
primary
election
which
bishop
a
conservative
state
senator
won
nearly
four
months
ago
the
scandal
of
which
occurred
in
the
more
rural
parts
of
the
district
with
fewer
voters
is
not
in
the
forefront
of
this
election
but
the
district's
history
of
absentee
ballot
fraud
isn't
ignored
either
mccready
mentioned
it
at
a
get-out-the-vote
rally
for
supporters
at
the
beer
bar
brawley's
beverage
on
this
final
weekend
of
the
campaign
a
subtle
reminder
that
the
fraud
happened
at
the
behest
of
republicans
this
election
on
september
is
the
people's
chance
to
get
justice
and
have
their
vote
heard
mccready
told
nbc
news
tuesday's
election
which
has
become
known
as
the
battle
of
the
dans
is
being
closely
watched
by
national
democrats
and
republicans
to
help
gauge
voters
mood
less
than
months
before
the
election
mccready
a
solar
energy
entrepreneur
and
former
marine
is
running
as
a
moderate
democrat
country
over
party
in
this
district
that
hasn't
seen
a
democrat
in
congress
since
he's
squaring
off
against
bishop
who
authored
the
controversial
bathroom
bill
that
prohibited
transgender
people
from
using
the
bathrooms
and
locker
rooms
of
their
gender
identity
both
campaigns
are
closely
watching
the
early
vote
numbers
especially
absentee
ballots
returned
by
mail
both
sides
are
also
watching
the
vote
data
closely
and
are
armed
with
lawyers
on
staff
as
well
as
volunteer
lawyers
in
each
of
the
eight
counties
to
ensure
a
fair
election
republicans
and
democrats
working
with
the
campaigns
as
well
as
independent
watchers
say
they
have
seen
nothing
abnormal
in
this
election's
early
vote
or
absentee
ballot
numbers
the
state
board
of
election
has
mandated
new
forms
to
be
used
at
the
county
boards
of
elections
to
track
who
requests
absentee
mail-in
ballots
and
who
submits
them
they
board
also
provides
extensive
detail
on
absentee
ballots
online
and
they
have
a
team
of
investigators
to
follow
up
on
complaints
if
there's
an
anomaly
in
the
absentee
ballot
data
it
will
be
found
said
pat
gannon
spokesperson
for
the
state
board
of
elections
michael
bitzer
professor
of
southern
politics
at
catawba
college
in
salisbury
n.c.
who
tracks
voter
data
in
north
carolina
elections
says
that
of
all
the
early
votes
cast
fewer
than
three
percent
have
been
cast
via
mail
which
he
said
is
on
par
with
the
expected
state
average
i
haven't
seen
any
kind
of
mysterious
trends
appear
like
exorbitant
absnetee
by-mail
absentee
ballot
requests
bitzer
said
i
just
think
brought
such
a
spot
light
that
everybody
is
on
their
best
behavior
still
the
election
is
on
the
back
of
minds
of
voters
mccready
supporter
mary
lou
cagle
said
that
mccready
should
have
declared
the
winner
instead
of
calling
for
a
new
election
that
is
likely
to
have
lower
voter
turnout
i
wish
what
they
would
have
done
is
let
dan
win
she
said
i
mean
just
throw
those
ballots
out
and
let
dan
win
bishop
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
absentee
ballot
scandal
said
he
doesn't
think
the
republican
party
is
tainted
because
of
it
but
he
did
acknowledge
that
some
frustration
among
voters
about
holding
a
new
election
i
do
think
that
people
were
very
discouraged
that
votes
were
cast
aside
on
an
issue
that
involved
very
very
few
bishop
told
nbc
news
referring
to
the
amount
of
votes
cast
in
the
election
in
a
tainted
vote
count
mccready
was
behind
republican
mark
harris
in
the
race
by
fewer
than
votes
when
democrats
swept
congressional
districts
across
the
country
now
that
democrats
control
the
house
of
representatives
political
watchers
are
anxious
to
see
how
voters
respond
to
democrats
in
more
conservative
districts
bishop
thinks
it
will
give
him
an
advantage
he
told
nbc
news
that
voters
are
seeing
what
the
democrats
are
all
about
pointing
to
the
green
new
deal
and
some
democrats
position
to
de-criminalize
crossing
the
border
he
is
tying
mccready
to
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
mccready
meanwhile
has
attempted
to
distance
himself
from
national
democrats
and
instead
run
a
campaign
focused
on
health
care
his
biography
and
education
repurposing
the
playbook
successfully
deployed
by
scores
of
democrats
who
won
in
bishop's
campaign
is
also
working
to
put
a
dent
into
mccready
who
has
high
name
recognition
after
nearly
months
on
the
campaign
trail
mccready
has
built
his
image
running
biographical
positive
television
ads
bishop
has
resorted
to
a
mostly
negative
campaign
in
an
attempt
to
shift
public
opinion
of
mccready
bishop
told
supporters
that
his
campaign
is
working
we
are
surging
we've
caught
him
and
we're
going
to
beat
him
bishop
said
to
applause
bishop
is
also
hanging
on
the
president's
popularity
in
the
district
insisting
that
trump's
support
here
remains
strong
trump
has
been
campaigning
from
afar
for
bishop
with
tweets
and
emails
to
supporters
he'll
hold
a
trump-style
rally
monday
night
in
fayetteville
and
vice
president
mike
pence
will
host
an
event
in
union
county
earlier
in
the
day
in
an
attempt
to
rally
support
to
push
bishop
over
the
finish
line
