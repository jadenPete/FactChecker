trump
turns
to
his
scandal
playbook
once
again
analysis
the
president
has
a
canned
approach
for
trying
to
fend
off
bad
news
this
time
it's
a
whistleblower
report
president
donald
trump
is
turning
to
what's
become
a
tried-and-true
pattern
of
defending
himself
against
scandal
in
the
latest
controversy
over
a
whistleblower's
accusation
that
he
made
a
disturbing
promise
to
a
foreign
leader
it
goes
like
this
step
one
deny
the
reports
while
arguing
that
even
if
true
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
what
was
done
step
two
divert
attention
to
a
subplot
that
implicates
political
rivals
step
three
discredit
investigators
by
accusing
those
involved
of
a
deep
state
or
partisan
witch
hunt
the
playbook
has
been
used
by
trump
and
his
surrogates
repeatedly
against
various
accusations
including
whether
his
campaign
held
an
improper
meeting
with
russians
promising
dirt
on
hillary
clinton
that
he
paid
hush
money
to
an
adult
film
actress
and
that
he
is
profiting
off
the
presidency
through
his
private
businesses
the
strategy
played
out
in
the
oval
office
on
friday
when
trump
was
pressed
about
a
whistleblower
report
by
an
intelligence
officer
who
raised
concerns
after
learning
of
an
alleged
promise
trump
made
during
a
phone
call
to
a
foreign
leader
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
the
complaint
the
washington
post
reported
on
thursday
evening
trump
denied
knowing
who
the
whistleblower
is
or
the
date
of
the
conversation
in
question
but
said
he
never
did
anything
wrong
anyway
it
was
a
totally
appropriate
conversation
it
was
actually
a
beautiful
conversation
trump
told
reporters
when
trump
was
asked
about
speculation
he
asked
the
ukrainian
president
to
investigate
joe
biden
the
president
deflected
he
tried
to
shift
to
his
own
accusation
that
biden
had
been
involved
in
a
quid
pro
quo
with
ukraine
connected
to
the
former
vice
president
son's
involvement
in
a
ukrainian
gas
company
it
was
the
same
pattern
of
defense
trump
used
when
media
reports
came
out
about
a
meeting
arranged
between
his
eldest
son
donald
trump
jr
and
a
russian
lawyer
whom
he
believed
had
dirt
on
hillary
clinton
trump
initially
denied
knowing
about
the
meeting
and
his
lawyer
denied
he
knew
anything
about
his
son's
response
to
the
media
reports
when
it
was
later
reported
and
eventually
confirmed
by
trump's
lawyers
that
trump
helped
his
son
write
a
misleading
statement
about
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
the
president
and
his
lawyers
shifted
their
defense
to
saying
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
having
such
a
meeting
throughout
the
russia
investigation
trump
and
his
allies
sought
to
discredit
any
findings
saying
they
were
a
politically
motivated
witch
hunt
accusing
robert
mueller's
investigators
of
being
angry
democrats
white
house
lawyers
have
since
stonewalled
subpoenas
by
house
democrats
into
the
trump
campaign's
connections
with
russia
and
now
trump's
used
a
similar
tactic
to
attempt
to
discredit
the
intelligence
community
whistleblower
it's
ridiculous
it's
a
partisan
whistleblower
he
said
like
with
the
russia
investigation
where
trump
tried
to
push
a
counter-narrative
about
obama
administration
spying
and
rogue
justice
department
officials
he
is
using
the
controversy
to
try
to
further
his
accusations
that
biden
was
involved
in
nefarious
deals
in
ukraine
it
was
a
pattern
he
also
followed
when
reports
came
out
that
trump
paid
hush
money
to
adult
film
actress
stormy
daniels
to
keep
quiet
about
an
affair
days
before
the
election
in
that
case
trump
denied
knowing
about
the
payments
but
as
more
reporting
came
out
suggesting
he
likely
was
aware
of
them
the
president
told
fox
news
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
because
no
campaign
funds
were
used
a
few
weeks
later
trump
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
told
fox
news
that
trump
had
indeed
reimbursed
cohen
for
the
payments
which
were
perfectly
legal
trump
then
shifted
the
blame
to
cohen
saying
as
his
lawyer
he
should
have
known
better
giuliani
on
thursday
night
dusted
off
the
playbook
he
used
for
months
defending
trump
against
accusations
his
campaign
coordinated
with
russian
election
interference
efforts
and
that
the
president
obstructed
justice
giuliani
appeared
to
both
admit
and
deny
asking
the
ukraine
officials
to
launch
an
investigation
into
biden
and
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
by
alleging
without
evidence
that
there
was
wrongdoing
by
the
former
vice
president
and
presidential
candidate
