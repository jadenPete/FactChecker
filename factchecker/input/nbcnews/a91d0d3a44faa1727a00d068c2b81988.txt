share
this
the
sharpie
is
mightier
trump
mocked
after
that
map
of
dorian's
path
even
the
city
council
in
washington
d.c.
got
in
on
the
act
tweeting
that
the
white
house
has
changed
its
mailing
address
to
alabama
avenue
president
donald
trump's
display
of
an
apparently
doctored
map
showing
alabama
in
the
path
of
hurricane
dorian
has
inspired
a
spate
of
satire
on
social
media
under
the
hashtag
sharpiegate
trump
showed
the
map
on
wednesday
in
the
oval
office
after
repeatedly
pressing
his
assertion
earlier
this
week
that
alabama
was
in
the
storm's
projected
path
the
national
weather
service
tweeted
soon
after
his
initial
claim
that
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
the
map
trump
displayed
was
the
same
as
a
model
produced
by
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
last
week
well
before
its
path
along
the
east
coast
had
become
clear
with
a
key
difference
a
smaller
black
circle
that
appeared
to
be
hand-drawn
with
a
sharpie
included
alabama
in
the
mode
meme
artists
joked
that
trump
might
next
try
to
add
a
few
inches
of
height
to
make
himself
taller
than
former
president
barack
obama
or
draw
himself
on
to
mount
rushmore
or
twitter
users
suggested
the
president
might
use
a
sharpie
to
display
his
proposed
wall
on
the
mexican
border
or
to
add
stick
figures
to
bolster
his
previously
disputed
claims
about
attendance
at
his
inaugural
it
was
just
so
obviously
ridiculous
impromptu
political
cartoonist
carrie
smith
told
nbc
news
on
thursday
about
her
image
of
the
crowd
at
the
president's
january
inauguration
with
stick
figures
drawn
in
trump
insisted
at
the
time
that
the
ceremony
drew
the
largest
audience
to
ever
witness
an
inauguration
period
both
in
person
and
around
the
globe
smith
a
year-old
marketing
consultant
from
raleigh
north
carolina
put
herself
into
trump's
mind
it
just
popped
into
my
head
well
the
media's
report
on
the
inaugural
was
obviously
a
lie
so
let's
dress
that
up
even
the
washington
d.c.
city
council
got
in
on
the
act
tweeting
a
sharpie-defaced
downtown
map
trump
might
not
live
at
pennsylvania
ave
anymore
the
council
said
according
to
this
change
of
address
postcard
we
received
the
white
house
has
announced
its
new
mailing
address
will
be
alabama
avenue
se
the
council
joked
with
a
sharpie
trump
recently
flirted
with
the
notion
of
buying
greenland
from
denmark
even
though
copenhagen
cannot
unilaterally
sell
the
north
atlantic
island
without
approval
of
the
largely
autonomous
greenlandic
government
at
least
one
netizen
believed
trump
could
just
try
drawing
greenland
into
united
states
control
got
greenland
the
commentator
wrote
trump
back
on
the
fourth
of
july
misspoke
and
said
the
continental
army
took
over
the
airports
in
their
fight
against
the
british
during
the
american
revolution
so
one
online
commentary
helped
the
president
by
drawing
airplanes
into
the
famed
painting
surrender
of
lord
cornwallis
which
illustrated
gen
george
washington's
decisive
win
at
yorktown
they
took
the
airports
