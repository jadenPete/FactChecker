this

indian
pm
modi
comes
to
the
u.s.
kashmiri
americans
fear
for
life
back
home
tensions
have
risen
and
daily
life
there
has
worsened
since
india
revoked
the
contested
region's
autonomy
last
month
as
indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
visits
houston
on
sunday
some
kashmiri
americans
are
there
to
thank
him
others
come
in
protest
the
split
in
the
community
comes
after
the
indian
government
revoked
the
kashmir
province's
special
status
in
early
august
the
move
revoked
article
of
the
indian
constitution
which
grants
indian-administered
muslim-majority
kashmir
a
degree
of
autonomy
it
had
allowed
the
province
its
own
decision-making
powers
and
barred
indians
outside
kashmir
from
buying
land
or
permanently
settling
there
modi
said
last
month
the
revocation
would
bring
stability
boost
the
area
economically
ensure
equal
rights
for
all
and
prevent
corruption
but
critics
of
india's
hindu
nationalist-led
government
see
the
move
as
an
attempt
to
dilute
the
demographics
of
kashmir
with
hindu
settlers
one
of
the
most
militarized
places
in
the
world
with
a
population
of
roughly
million
kashmir
is
nestled
among
the
nuclear
powers
of
india
pakistan
and
china
and
has
been
a
source
of
contention
in
the
region
for
decades
india
and
pakistan
and
both
claim
the
region
in
its
entirety
and
two
of
the
three
wars
they
have
fought
since
their
independence
from
british
rule
were
over
kashmir
rebels
in
indian-controlled
kashmir
have
been
fighting
indian
control
since
most
kashmiris
support
the
rebels
demand
that
the
territory
be
united
either
under
pakistani
rule
or
as
an
independent
country
while
also
participating
in
civilian
street
protests
against
indian
control
about
people
have
been
killed
in
the
uprising
and
the
ensuing
indian
crackdown
but
this
time
with
the
revocation
of
article
things
are
different
according
to
sameer
yasir
a
journalist
based
in
kashmir
it's
nothing
like
before
yasir
said
there's
so
much
of
silence
that
it
looks
like
a
graveyard
with
the
revocation
of
article
came
the
suspension
of
internet
and
cell
service
enactment
of
a
curfew
and
the
detention
of
some
political
leaders
and
separatists
many
point
out
that
such
restrictions
are
not
new
to
daily
kashmiri
life
while
the
region
has
been
facing
an
ongoing
violent
insurgency
the
last
major
flare-up
occurred
in
when
a
kashmiri
separatist
commander
was
killed
by
indian
security
forces
at
the
time
militants
and
separatists
turned
to
facebook
and
whatsapp
for
information
and
violent
clashes
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
about
civilians
during
those
tensions
some
parts
of
kashmir
were
put
under
curfew
for
several
months
rajiv
pandit
a
surgeon
in
dallas
whose
family
is
one
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
kashmiri
hindus
who
were
forced
to
flee
in
supports
the
revocation
of
article
but
said
he
understands
the
concerns
with
the
clampdown
because
it
happened
so
suddenly
he
and
other
kashmiri
pandits
in
the
u.s.
argue
that
it
will
bolster
the
region's
struggling
economy
and
ensure
equal
rights
for
kashmir's
religious
minorities
i
can
understand
why
the
people
would
feel
why
they
cannot
trust
these
latest
moves
by
the
government
but
in
the
long
run
this
is
going
to
be
good
said
pandit
a
board
member
of
the
indo-american
kashmir
forum
and
the
hindu-american
foundation
we
just
want
to
go
home
like
anyone
who
lost
generations
of
property
we
lost
our
culture
we
lost
our
jobs
we
lost
our
livelihood
we
want
to
go
back
but
we
want
to
go
back
to
that
secular
place
that
we
thought
was
part
of
the
fabric
of
kashmir
yet
while
some
are
celebrating
others
have
a
different
vision
for
the
future
of
kashmir
wasim
dar
an
associate
professor
of
surgery
base
in
houston
plans
to
be
at
the
modi
event
to
protest
and
bring
his
community's
narrative
to
the
table
somebody
has
to
speak
for
them
said
dar
an
organizer
with
stand
with
kashmir
a
diaspora-led
organization
that
is
fighting
for
the
right
to
self-determination
for
kashmir
on
sunday
the
group
planned
to
protest
modi's
sold-out
appearance
at
nrg
stadium
in
houston
with
president
donald
trump
which
is
expected
to
draw
an
audience
of
as
many
as
busloads
of
people
will
be
coming
from
dallas
to
protest
dar
said
the
protests
are
important
to
some
kashmiri
americans
not
just
because
of
the
situation
in
the
province
but
also
because
of
the
historical
narrative
of
kashmir
and
how
it's
been
largely
framed
as
a
political
conflict
between
india
and
pakistan
as
a
result
many
kashmiris
feel
as
though
their
cultural
narratives
have
been
lost
that's
where
the
diaspora
comes
in
said
ather
zia
an
assistant
professor
of
gender
studies
and
anthropology
at
the
university
of
northern
colorado
in
greeley
because
we
have
a
long
collective
memory
it's
a
legacy
it's
a
trauma
that's
been
handed
over
to
us
in
kashmir
today
the
picture
is
grim
several
families
huddle
together
in
one
home
taking
turns
making
phone
calls
using
the
only
available
landline
they
journey
miles
on
foot
to
visit
family
members
and
must
travel
elsewhere
including
to
delhi
to
get
the
medicines
they
once
could
order
online
it's
very
dystopic
said
zia
who
has
lived
in
the
united
states
for
over
years
but
still
has
many
family
members
in
kashmir
including
her
parents
we
didn't
have
any
contact
for
almost
a
month
zia
said
the
landline
in
her
parent's
home
one
of
the
few
in
the
neighborhood
finally
started
working
again
last
week
although
service
is
spotty
there's
a
huge
amount
of
uncertainty
dar
said
there's
no
predicting
what's
going
to
happen
next
zia
added
i
look
at
the
kids
growing
up
there
right
now
everyone
is
worried
about
their
education
everyone
is
worried
about
their
mental
health
we
were
those
kids
because
we
have
also
gone
through
similar
sieges
similar
crackdowns
similar
constraints
similar
agitations
similar
uprisings
normal
is
not
normal
in
kashmir
