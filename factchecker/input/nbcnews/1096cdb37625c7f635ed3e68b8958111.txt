share
this
from
crowd
size
to
sharpie-gate
it's
all
about
debase
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
it's
one
thing
for
a
politician
to
embarrass
themsleves
it's
another
for
that
politician
to
actually
use
government
employees
and
taxpayer
funds
to
further
that
embarrassment
and
that's
precisely
what
president
trump
has
done
to
justify
his
claim
that
alabama
was
somehow
a
target
of
hurricane
dorian
when
dorian
has
been
hitting
other
states
like
the
carolinas
the
white
house
yesterday
released
this
letter
from
the
president's
homeland
security
and
counter-terrorism
adviser
rear
adm
peter
j.
brown
while
speaking
to
the
press
sunday
september
the
president
addressed
hurricane
dorian
and
its
potential
impact
on
multiple
states
including
alabama
the
president's
comments
were
based
on
that
morning's
hurricane
dorian
briefing
which
including
the
possibility
of
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
southeastern
alabama
in
fact
from
the
evening
of
tuesday
august
until
the
morning
of
monday
september
forecasts
from
the
national
hurricane
center
showed
the
possibility
of
tropical
storm
force
winds
hitting
parts
of
alabama
and
it's
not
the
first
time
trump
has
done
this
with
government
personnel
and
resources
it's
been
the
pattern
since
the
very
first
day
of
his
administration
when
he
sent
out
his
press
secretary
to
show
edited
photos
inflating
his
inaugural
crowd
size
as
nbc's
shannon
pettypiece
writes
or
a
few
months
later
when
he
created
a
commission
to
search
for
evidence
of
widespread
voter
fraud
after
falsely
claiming
there
were
millions
of
illegal
votes
in
or
in
between
when
he
requested
congress
investigate
a
baseless
allegation
that
president
barack
obama
had
his
phones
at
trump
tower
wiretapped
what
we
still
don't
get
is
how
these
bureaucrats
and
politicians
including
those
with
sterling
reputations
allow
themselves
to
get
used
in
this
embarrassment
why
by
the
way
the
washington
post
reports
that
it
was
trump
himself
who
used
the
black
sharpie
to
mark
up
that
official
hurricane
map
remember
howard
schultz
the
former
starbucks
ceo
considering
an
independent
white
house
bid
well
he
won't
be
running
for
president
after
all
schultz
released
a
statement
this
morning
citing
vitriol
his
back
surgeries
and
the
possibility
that
yes
a
moderate
could
become
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
cough
joe
biden
cough
it
has
become
more
likely
that
the
democratic
nominee
will
not
be
known
before
the
deadlines
to
submit
the
required
number
of
signatures
for
an
independent
to
get
on
the
ballot
if
i
went
forward
there
is
a
risk
that
my
name
would
appear
on
ballots
even
if
a
moderate
democrat
wins
the
nomination
and
that
is
not
a
risk
i
am
willing
to
take
schultz
writes
you
can
tell
which
democratic
er
has
a
midwestern
constituency
and
which
one
doesn't
in
how
they
answered
the
same
cheeseburger
climate
change
during
cnn's
town
halls
on
wednesday
question
climate
change
has
been
linked
to
to
agriculture
and
the
over
consumption
of
red
meat
and
also
the
over
production
of
crops
certain
countries
have
changed
the
dietary
deadlines
to
reduce
the
consumption
of
red
meat
in
light
of
the
impact
of
of
the
climate
change
if
elected
will
you
be
supporting
change
in
dietary
guidelines
and
then
how
will
you
plan
on
implementing
the
changes
so
that
people
effectively
change
the
diets
kamala
harris
yes
i
mean
it's
and
thank
you
carol
for
your
work
on
the
question
there
is
i
think
of
the
point
that
you're
raising
in
the
in
a
broader
context
which
is
that
as
a
nation
we
actually
have
to
have
a
real
priority
at
the
highest
level
of
government
around
what
we
eat
and
in
terms
of
health
eating
because
we
have
a
problem
in
america
snip
i
mean
just
to
be
very
honest
with
you
i
love
cheeseburgers
from
time
to
time
right
i
mean
i
i
just
do
and
and
i
think
that
but
there
is
but
there
has
to
be
also
what
we
do
in
terms
of
creating
incentives
that
we
will
eat
in
a
healthy
way
that
we
will
encourage
moderation
and
that
we
will
be
educated
about
the
effects
of
our
eating
s
habits
on
our
environment
and
we
have
to
do
a
much
better
job
of
that
and
the
government
has
to
do
a
much
better
job
of
that
versus
question
the
amazon
rainforest
is
currently
burning
after
being
cleared
for
the
cattle
and
dairy
industry
to
expand
and
livestock
being
grown
irresponsibly
has
caused
an
accumulation
of
co
in
the
atmosphere
as
a
senator
from
minnesota
an
agricultural
state
that
produces
large
amounts
of
cheese
and
beef
how
can
young
climate
change
activists
like
myself
trust
you
to
take
on
the
beef
and
dairy
industries
that
have
so
much
influence
in
our
government
amy
klobuchar
i
am
hopeful
that
we're
going
to
be
able
to
do
this
in
a
way
especially
when
i
am
president
that
we
can
continue
to
have
hamburgers
and
cheese
but
at
the
same
time
understand
that
there
are
many
people
that
choose
to
eat
vegan
and
that
is
great
too
but
let
me
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
a
different
perspective
on
our
farmers
and
what
we
can
do
to
make
them
part
of
the
solution
because
i
have
seen
in
rural
america
many
incredible
farmers
and
ones
that
are
struggling
right
now
to
keep
going
