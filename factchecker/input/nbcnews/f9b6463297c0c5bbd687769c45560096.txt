praises
alabama

that
contradicted

acting

neil
jacobs
said
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration's
acting
chief
on
tuesday
sought
to
explain
a
controversial
unsigned
statement
his
agency
put
out
last
week
defending
president
donald
trump's
claim
that
hurricane
dorian
could
hit
alabama
but
also
thanked
the
alabama
weather
office
that
had
contradicted
the
president's
assertion
in
a
speech
to
the
national
weather
association
in
huntsville
ala
noaa
acting
administrator
neil
jacobs
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
agency's
unsigned
statement
on
friday
in
defense
of
trump
was
was
to
clarify
the
technical
aspects
and
potential
impacts
of
dorian
what
it
did
not
say
however
is
that
we
understand
and
fully
support
the
good
intent
of
the
birmingham
weather
forecast
office
which
was
to
calm
fears
and
support
public
safety
jacobs
added
attendees
of
the
speech
said
jacobs
voice
cracked
multiple
times
during
his
remarks
and
he
appeared
near
tears
at
some
points
noaa's
friday
statement
defended
trump's
claims
that
the
hurricane
would
affect
alabama
adding
that
national
weather
service's
birmingham
office
was
wrong
to
speak
in
absolute
terms
that
were
inconsistent
with
probabilities
from
the
best
forecast
products
available
at
the
time
regarding
its
tweet
insisting
alabama
was
not
at
risk
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
statement
is
being
reviewed
by
the
inspector
general
of
the
commerce
department
which
oversees
noaa
noaa
is
in
charge
of
the
national
weather
service
sen
jeanne
shaheen
d-n
h.
the
ranking
democrat
on
the
appropriations
subcommittee
that
funds
noaa
has
also
called
on
the
commerce
department
inspector
general
to
investigate
the
statement
trump
tweeted
on
sept
that
alabama
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
by
the
storm
at
that
time
the
southeastern
corner
of
alabama
stood
at
a
minuscule
risk
of
receiving
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
excess
of
miles
per
hour
but
the
state
was
not
in
the
national
hurricane
center's
projected
path
for
the
storm
or
its
cone
of
uncertainty
which
by
that
point
showed
the
hurricane
moving
up
the
east
coast
about
minutes
after
trump's
tweet
the
national
weather
service's
office
in
birmingham
tweeted
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
because
the
storm
will
remain
too
far
east
trump
however
doubled
down
later
that
day
twice
telling
reporters
that
the
storm
was
threatening
alabama
then
on
wednesday
trump
displayed
an
apparently
doctored
map
in
the
oval
office
that
showed
alabama
circled
in
black
marker
that
looked
to
be
from
a
sharpie
to
be
within
dorian's
path
during
his
speech
tuesday
jacobs
discussed
hurricane
dorian
and
the
difficulties
of
forecasting
such
an
incredibly
intimidating
storm
at
one
point
alabama
was
in
the
mix
as
was
the
rest
of
the
southeast
jacobs
said
he
added
that
the
forecasts
for
hurricane
dorian
could
have
moved
west
or
north
in
any
direction
as
everyone
in
this
room
knows
forecast
models
change
he
said
it's
very
hard
to
quantify
possibilities
and
to
translate
that
to
what
information
the
public
needs
meanwhile
noaa's
acting
chief
scientist
has
said
he
would
investigate
why
the
agency
backed
trump's
claims
about
hurricane
dorian
hitting
alabama
over
its
own
forecasters
in
an
internal
email
obtained
by
nbc
news
noaa's
craig
mclean
wrote
sunday
that
the
friday
statement
issued
by
the
agency
in
defense
of
trump
inappropriately
and
incorrectly
contradicted
the
national
weather
service
forecaster
mclean
posted
the
full
text
of
his
message
to
the
noaa
website
tuesday
he
said
that
the
statement
friday
violated
noaa's
policies
of
scientific
integrity
