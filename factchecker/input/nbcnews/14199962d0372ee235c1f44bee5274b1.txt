too
busy
impeaching
trump
to
focus
on
kavanaugh
claims
we
have
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
right
now
and
that's
going

take
up

washington
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
responded
to
calls
for
an
investigation
into
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
in
light
of
new
sexual
misconduct
allegations
by
saying
that
the
panel
has
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
in
a
radio
interview
with
wnyc
on
monday
nadler
was
asked
if
he'd
be
concerned
with
democrats
thinking
he's
not
taking
the
kavanaugh
allegations
seriously
enough
he
said
his
committee
has
too
much
on
its
plate
we
have
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
right
now
and
that's
going
to
take
up
our
limited
resources
and
time
for
a
while
nadler
said
asked
about
whether
he
plans
to
keep
his
promise
from
last
october
of
investigating
kavanaugh
over
his
senate
confirmation
hearing
nadler
was
candid
about
his
position
on
impeaching
the
president
frankly
we
are
concentrating
our
resources
on
determining
whether
to
impeach
the
president
personally
i
think
the
president
ought
to
be
impeached
but
we
have
to
concentrate
on
that
for
the
next
few
months
he
said
over
the
weekend
a
pair
of
new
york
times
reporters
in
an
opinion-section
article
previewing
their
upcoming
book
on
kavanaugh's
confirmation
said
they
found
new
corroboration
for
accusations
that
kavanaugh
exposed
himself
to
deborah
ramirez
a
classmate
at
yale
nbc
news
has
not
verified
that
reporting
the
reporters
said
that
former
yale
classmate
max
stier
told
senators
and
the
fbi
about
a
different
episode
of
alleged
sexual
misconduct
two
people
with
first-hand
knowledge
confirm
to
nbc
news
that
the
fbi
was
notified
of
stier's
claim
the
chairman
said
that
his
committee
plans
to
question
fbi
director
christopher
wray
next
month
including
about
the
agency's
investigation
into
kavanaugh
nadler
continued
by
saying
he
personally
believes
impeaching
the
president
is
imperative
so
that
democrats
can
vindicate
the
constitution
acknowledging
that
its
purpose
would
not
be
removing
trump
from
office
because
the
gop-controlled
senate
wouldn't
do
that
nadler
said
that
while
he
feels
there
is
already
enough
information
to
impeach
the
president
he
believes
the
committee
needs
to
educate
the
public
to
get
behind
impeachment
before
moving
forward
we
have
to
show
that
there
are
adequate
grounds
for
impeachment
that
there
are
imperative
grounds
for
impeachment
and
convince
people
if
that
happens
if
people
are
convinced
after
the
hearings
that
the
president
should
be
impeached
then
we
will
be
able
to
get
the
votes
if
that
doesn't
happen
we
won't
be
able
to
get
the
votes
nadler
said
the
judiciary
committee
approved
a
resolution
last
thursday
that
set
procedures
and
rules
for
future
impeachment
investigation

first
such
hearing
will
be
held

light
of
the
new
allegations
