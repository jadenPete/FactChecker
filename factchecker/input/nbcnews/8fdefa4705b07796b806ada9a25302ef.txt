the
former
starbucks
ceo
who
had
been
weighing
an
independent
presidential
bid
announced
friday
that
he
will
not
run
for
president
my
belief
in
the
need
to
reform
our
two-party
system
has
not
wavered
but
i
have
concluded
that
an
independent
campaign
for
the
white
house
is
not
how
i
can
best
serve
our
country
at
this
time
schultz
said
in
statement
schultz
added
that
the
money
he
would
have
allocated
to
a
campaign
will
instead
be
used
to
invest
in
people
organizations
and
ideas
that
promote
honesty
civility
and
results
in
our
politics
and
that
move
the
country
beyond
two-party
gridlock

he
was
exploring
a
run
for
president
as
an

ambitions
were
widely
criticized
by
democrats
concerned
that
his
bid
would
end
up
helping
president
donald
trump
retain
control
of
the
white
house
in
april
schultz
announced
he
would
be
taking
a
break
from
