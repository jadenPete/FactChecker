jimmy
carter
says
he
couldn't
have
handled
presidency
at
two
leading
democratic
candidates
joe
biden
and
bernie
sanders
would
turn
during
their
terms
if
elected
atlanta
weeks
shy
of
his
th
birthday
former
president
jimmy
carter
said
he
doesn't
believe
he
could
have
managed
the
most
powerful
office
in
the
world
at
years
old
carter
who
earlier
this
year
became
the
longest-lived
chief
executive
in
american
history
didn't
tie
his
comments
to
any
of
his
fellow
democrats
running
for
president
in
but
two
leading
candidates
joe
biden
and
bernie
sanders
would
turn
during
their
terms
if
elected
biden
is
sanders
is
i
hope
there's
an
age
limit
carter
said
with
a
laugh
as
he
answered
audience
questions
on
tuesday
during
his
annual
report
at
the
carter
center
in
atlanta
if
i
were
just
years
old
if
i
was
years
younger
i
don't
believe
i
could
undertake
the
duties
i
experienced
when
i
was
president
carter's
observation
came
in
response
to
a
jovial
inquiry
about
whether
he
had
considered
running
in
since
he's
still
constitutionally
allowed
another
term
the
th
president
left
office
in
at
the
age
of
after
losing
his
reelection
bid
to
ronald
reagan
who
served
two
terms
and
left
office
as
the
oldest
sitting
president
in
history
at
either
biden
or
sanders
would
be
older
upon
their
inauguration
than
reagan
was
on
his
final
day
in
the
oval
office
at
president
donald
trump
is
a
record
setter
as
well
he
eclipsed
reagan's
mark
as
the
oldest
newly
elected
president
in
history
and
would
become
the
oldest
president
to
be
reelected
age
has
been
a
flashpoint
for
some
critics
of
trump
sanders
and
biden
carter
who
turns
on
oct
said
the
oval
office
requires
a
president
to
be
very
flexible
with
your
mind
particularly
on
foreign
affairs
he
was
speaking
on
the
st
anniversary
of
the
camp
david
accords
a
peace
agreement
he
negotiated
with
egyptian
president
anwar
sadat
and
israeli
prime
minister
menachem
begin
you
have
to
be
able
to
go
from
one
subject
to
another
and
concentrate
on
each
one
adequately
and
then
put
them
together
in
a
comprehensive
way
like
i
did
between
begin
and
sadat
with
the
peace
agreement
carter
said
the
things
i
faced
in
foreign
affairs
i
don't
think
i
could
undertake
them
at
years
old
he
continued
before
adding
with
a
smile
at
it's
out
of
the
question
i'm
having
a
hard
time
walking
carter
said
he
remains
undecided
in
the
primary
i'm
going
to
keep
an
open
mind
he
said
explaining
that
he
wants
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who
pledges
to
make
the
u.s.
the
world's
leading
champion
for
peace
human
rights
and
equality
one
of
the
major
factors
i
will
have
in
my
mind
is
who
can
beat
trump
he
added
noting
that
he'll
vote
for
the
democratic
nominee
in
the
general
election
regardless
still
carter's
assessments
on
age
could
leave
him
with
few
easy
choices
in
the
primary
carter
repeated
his
previous
disclosure
that
he
voted
for
sanders
over
hillary
clinton
in
siding
with
the
democratic
socialist
over
the
party
establishment
favorite
but
carter
has
since
warned
democrats
not
to
go
too
far
left
lest
they
risk
alienating
independents
and
moderate
republicans
who
can
help
the
party
defeat
trump
he
has
specifically
cited
proposals
like
a
single-payer
health
insurance
system
as
potential
deal-breakers
for
some
voters
inclined
to
vote
against
trump
sanders
and
another
leading
progressive
candidate
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
back
single-payer
health
insurance
run
by
the
federal
government
warren
is
years
old
meanwhile
biden
is
leading
most
national
and
early
state
primary
polls
in
part
because
of
his
strength
among
more
moderate
democrats
other
moderates
in
the
field
trail
far
behind
biden
sanders
and
warren
when
carter
ran
and
won
in
he
was
the
outsider
toppling
establishment
favorites
but
the
former
georgia
governor
also
represented
the
more
moderate
wing
of
a
party
that
had
been
dominated
by
northeastern
liberals
since
his
defeat
however
republicans
have
used
carter
as
a
liberal
caricature
and
carter
himself
through
his
work
at
the
carter
center
has
embraced
the
role
of
an
outspoken
human
rights
advocate
willing
to
criticize
the
world's
establishment
institutions
and
accepted
world
order
he's
long
blasted
israel's
treatment
of
palestinians
even
as
both
major
u.s.
parties
more
carefully
navigated
the
u.s.
alliance
with
israel
as
israel
tallies
votes
from
its
tuesday
elections
carter
lamented
that
returning
hard-line
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
to
power
could
end
the
peace
process
altogether
exit
polls
show
that
netanyahu's
party
fell
short
of
securing
a
parliamentary
majority
potentially
threatening
his
position
speaking
about
his
post-presidency
legacy
carter
said
he
wants
the
carter
center
which
has
focused
since
on
public
health
and
election
monitoring
to
be
more
willing
to
criticize
the
u.s.
government
advocate
for
policies
to
combat
the
climate
crisis
and
explicitly
take
sides
against
war
the
carter
center
has
been
basically
mute
on
the
subject
of
global
warming
carter
said
putting
blame
on
himself
he
also
warned
americans
against
the
consequences
of
perpetual
military
conflict
he
noted
that
china
the
major
economic
and
geopolitical
competitor
to
the
u.s.
has
spent
four
decades
at
peace
since
carter
normalized
relations
with
beijing
in
that
time
china
has
spent
trillions
of
dollars
on
infrastructure
and
education
carter
said
while
the
u.s.
has
spent
corresponding
amounts
on
military
engagement
that
just
shows
you
the
difference
between
peace
and
war
carter
said
later
adding
i
just
want
to
keep
the
world
at
peace
