washington
this
week
the
democratic
party
in
south
dakota
announced
it
was
closing
its
last
two
offices
in
the
state
the
move
surprised
some
analysts
and
brought
criticism
from
some
quarters
as
an
example
of
democrats
abandoning
difficult
political
terrain
but
a
look
at
the
numbers
over
the
past
years
shows
some
of
the
thinking
behind
those
moves
the
changes
in
culture
and
politics
in
that
time
have
left
an
election
map
that
is
full
of
communities
that
are
either
deep
red
or
deep
blue
with
little
room
for
the
political
space
between
the
presidential
elections
of
and
offer
some
remarkable
evidence
in
president
bill
clinton
won
re-election
by
a
large
margin
percentage
points
but
the
results
at
the
country
level
showed
a
much
more
purple
map
in
more
than
counties
the
margins
for
clinton
or
his
opponent
bob
dole
were
within
single
digits
in
the
national
results
were
very
tight
hillary
clinton
won
the
popular
vote
by
about
points
over
donald
trump
and
of
course
trump
won
the
electoral
college
vote
but
there
were
only
counties
where
the
margins
for
either
candidate
were
in
the
single-digit
range
that
means
in
years
the
number
of
competitive
counties
declined
by
about
percent
that's
a
huge
drop
but
it's
even
more
extraordinary
when
you
consider
than
the
election
was
much
closer
nationally
than
the
election
it's
a
set
of
numbers
that
show
how
much
the
territory
in
the
political
middle
has
shrunken
literally
yes
third-party
candidate
ross
perot
may
have
had
some
impact
on
those
numbers
around
the
edges
but
his
net
impact
was
not
large
and
the
data
show
something
bigger
going
on
driving
the
shift
seems
to
be
a
familiar
culprit
the
growing
divide
between
urban
and
rural
america
in
bill
clinton
did
well
in
urban
communities
he
won
six
of
the
largest
vote-producing
counties
but
in
hillary
clinton
did
even
better
she
won
nine
of
the
biggest
vote
producers
all
but
maricopa
the
home
of
phoenix
which
she
lost
by
just
three
points
the
reverse
is
true
in
rural
places
in
bob
dole
of
of
the
smallest
vote
producing
counties
but
in
donald
trump
won
of
the
smallest
vote
producers
urban
areas
have
gotten
more
blue
and
rural
ones
have
gotten
more
red
and
the
impact
of
that
shift
is
even
more
apparent
when
you
look
at
the
margins
in
some
of
the
places
consider
what's
happened
in
the
counties
holding
some
of
the
nation's
biggest
cities
in
marion
county
home
of
indianapolis
went
for
dole
by
points
in
it
gave
hillary
clinton
a
point
margin
dole
won
dallas
county
in
texas
by
one
point
hillary
clinton
won
it
by
points
and
mecklenburg
county
home
of
charlotte
nc
voted
for
bill
clinton
by
a
narrow
three-point
margin
in
but
voted
for
hillary
by
points
those
are
big
swings
toward
the
democrats
in
and
remember
bill
clinton
won
the
popular
vote
by
a
much
larger
margin
in
meanwhile
the
margins
have
moved
massively
in
the
other
direction
in
rural
places
in
dole
won
desoto
county
florida
dodge
county
wisconsin
and
ionia
county
michigan
each
by
one
point
in
trump
won
them
by
points
points
and
points
respectively
those
counties
and
others
like
them
were
key
elements
of
trump's
rural
surge
that
carried
those
states
does
all
of
this
mean
that
candidates
and
parties
shouldn't
try
to
win
over
voters
that
aren't
necessarily
aligned
with
them
of
course
not
building
an
actual
working
majority
in
politics
requires
reaching
beyond
just
one's
base
but
time
and
money
are
limited
and
these
numbers
suggest
that
in
very
real
terms
that
there
are
fewer
and
fewer
places
for
candidates
to
target
swing
voters
who
might
be
receptive
to
their
messages
it's
a
lot
easier
to
find
areas
full
of
base
supporters
where
candidates
can
focus
on
boosting
turnout
in
other
words
the
middle
ground
of
american
politics
may
be
literally
disappearing
but
to
a
large
extent
candidates
and
parties
are
playing
on
the
terrain
they've
been
given
