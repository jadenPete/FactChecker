research
compiled
one
year
ago
by
customs
and
border
protection
pointed
to
an
overwhelming
factor
driving
record-setting
migration
to
the

from
guatemala
crop
shortages
were
leaving
rural
guatemalans
especially
in
the
country's
western

in
extreme
poverty
and
starving
an
internal
report
that
was
circulated
to
senior
homeland
security
officials
and
obtained
by
nbc
news
showed
that
migration
surged
from
those
areas
of
guatemala
without
reliable
subsistence
farming
or
wages
from
commercial
farming
jobs
more
than
guatemalans
headed
north
last
year
and
many
more
followed
in
fiscal
year
making
guatemala
the
single
largest
country
contributing
to
undocumented
immigration
across
the
u.s.
southwest
border
this
year
scientists
have
said
the
increase
in
poverty
and
food
insecurity
driving
migration
are
due
to
multiple
factors
one
of
which
is
climate
change
the
acting
secretary
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
which
oversees
cbp
kevin
mcaleenan
has
publicly
sounded
the
alarm
about
guatemala's
food
scarcity
but
inside
the
trump
white
house
that
message
was
largely
ignored
in
both
policy
decisions
and
messaging
around
what
should
be
done
to
stem
the
flow
of
migrants
last
october
a
month
after
the
cbp
report
was
finalized
president
donald
trump
announced
he
was
considering
suspending
foreign
aid
to
guatemala
which
included
money
used
to
mitigate
the
affects
of
climate
change
on
small
farms
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
were
not
able
to
do
the
job
of
stopping
people
from
leaving
their
country
and
coming
illegally
to
the
u.s.
president
trump
tweeted
in
october
we
will
now
begin
cutting
off
or
substantially
reducing
the
massive
foreign
aid
routinely
given
to
them
in
april
the
administration
followed
through
undertaking
a
review
of
fiscal
year
assistance
and
freezing
million
in
foreign
aid
slated
for
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
over
million
in
fiscal
year
foreign
aid
will
also
be
reprogrammed
elsewhere
including
outside
the
western
hemisphere
with
evidence
of
a
correlation
between
acute
food
insecurity
and
migration
in
hand
the
trump
administration
instead
focused
on
an
agreement
with
the
government
of
guatemala
to
stem
the
flow
of
immigrants
through
law
enforcement
means
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
under
the
agreement
with
guatemala
an
outline
of
which
was
obtained
by
nbc
news
nearly
americans
from
immigration
and
customs
and
enforcement
and
cbp
are
slated
to
deploy
to
guatemala
to
stop
immigrants
from
other
central
american
countries
from
passing
through
their
borders
on
the
way
to
the
u.s.

and

guatemalan
law

are
also
included
in
the
deal
which
was
outlined
in

and
solidified
in
july
the

is
sought
in

to
reduce

carry

the
necessary

concrete
actions
to

and
the
interdiction
of
illicit

nowhere
in
the
agreement
is
food
insecurity
or
foreign
aid
mentioned
under
the
trump
administration
the
united
states
has
funded
million
through
the
overseas
private
investment
corporation
the
federal
government's
development
finance
institution
to
increase
housing
opportunities
in
guatemala
and
an
agreement
between
guatemala
and
the
department
of
labor
was
signed
in
july
to
ensure
that
guatemalan
farm
workers
coming
to
the
u.s.
on
temporary
visas
are
vetted
by
the
guatemalan
government
but
none
of
those
actions
take
on
the
impact
of
climate
change
and
variability
on
the
food
supply
in
guatemala's
highlands
between
and
the
u.s.
agency
for
international
development
usaid
committed
around
million
to
rural
development
programs
in
guatemala
according
to
a
usaid
document
reviewed
by
nbc

usaid
has
operated
programs
in

specifically
designed
to
help
to
mitigate

of

rust
a
climate
change-fueled
fungus
according
to
an
agency
spokesperson
we
continue
to
move
forward
on
the
president's
decision
regarding
foreign
assistance
for
guatemala
and
have
ceased
obligating
new
funds
for
guatemala
the
move
to
freeze
funding
frustrated
those
within
the
administration
and
outside
of
it
who
had
been
advocating
for
solutions
to
the
push
factors
of
immigration
over
law
enforcement-oriented
solutions
that
crack
down
on
pull
factors
like
building
a
wall
to
block
migrants
at
the
u.s.
border
but
a
dhs
official
said
the
high
turnover
inside
the
agency
has
made
officials
nervous
about
keeping
their
jobs
and
anxious
to
please
the
white
house
particularly
senior
adviser
stephen
miller
everyone
knows
miller
isn't
interested
in
hearing
about
climate
change
the
dhs
official
said
a
senior
federal
law
enforcement
official
echoed
those
sentiments
there
is
a
root
cause
of
migration
but
the
question
presupposes
that
if
you
know
there's
a
refugee
crisis
related
to
climate
change
you
should
do
something
about
it
in
an
interview
with
the
washington
post
in
september
then-cbp
commissioner
mcaleenan
said
food
insecurity
not
violence
seems
to
be
a
key
push
factor
informing
the
decision
to
travel
from
guatemala
where
we
have
seen
the
largest
growth
in
migration
flow
this
year
he
based
his
position
largely
on
interviews
conducted
by
border
patrol
agents
with
immigrants
at
the
border
where
they
are
routinely
asked
to
be
as
specific
as
possible
about
where
they
are
from
by
overlaying
that
information
with
data
about
food
insecurity
cbp
saw
clear
evidence
of
a
correlation
the
cbp
data
made
clear
that
in
areas
suffering
acute
food
insecurity
like
guatemala's
huehuetenago
chiquimula
and
zacapa
departments
the
rates
of
migration
were
higher
than
in
areas
without
food
shortage
concerns
scientists
say
food
insecurity
can
be
traced
to
several
factors
a
fungus
known
as
coffee
leaf
rust
is
rapidly
expanding
due
to
climate
change
throughout
the
dry
corridor
a
transnational
area
stretching
through
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
in
so
doing
it
is
killing
the
region's
cash
crop
coffee
that
along
with
global
competition
plus
a
years-long
drought
has
made
the
plant
virtually
worthless
other
crops
are
suffering
too
making
jobs
in
commercial
farming
to
supplement
income
hard
to
come
by
as
well
leaving
entire
communities
without
food
to
sell
or
money
to
buy
food
to
eat
our
research
suggests
that
the
main
driver
of
the
recent
migration
in
guatemala
is
increasing
socio-economic
vulnerability
said
diego
pons
an
applied
climatologist
with
columbia
university's
international
research
institute
for
climate
and
society
part
of
the
earth
institute
this
was
made
worse
because
of
a
multi-year
drought
that
cannot
be
explained
by
climate
change
alone
but
it's
a
part
of
a
larger
complex
climate
system
this
week
insivumeh
the
national
meteorological
service
of
guatemala
announced
the
launch
of
the
nextgen
seasonal
forecasting
system
with
the
scientific
support
of
the
actoday
initiative
led
by
columbia
world
projects
which
pons
said
is
the
type
of
program
that
could
mitigate
some
effects
of
climate
change
and
variability
on
the
lives
of
guatemalans
it
helps
farmers
determine
when
to
plant
and
it
does
not
rely
on
u.s.
foreign
aid
nextgen
will
help
make
guatemala
a
leader
in
the
region
when
it
comes
to
climate
forecasting
this
is
a
historic
step
forward
for
the
country
it
will
now
be
able
to
provide
climate
services
not
just
to
some
but
to
all
guatemalans
especially
those
who
depend
on
rain-fed
agriculture
for
food
and
income
while
visiting
chiquimula
and
zacapa
with
the
world

program

villages
where

were

where

today
the
