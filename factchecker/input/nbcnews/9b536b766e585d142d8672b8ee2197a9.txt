biden
said
former
vice
president
joe
biden
on
sunday
made
his
most
expansive
speech
yet
on
race
calling
on
the
nation
to
live
up
to
its
founding
ideals
and
saying
that
silence
on
racism
amounts
to
complicity
there
can
be
no
realization
of
the
american
dream
without
grappling
with
the
original
sin
of
slavery
biden
told
churchgoers
in
alabama
while
delivering
the
keynote
address
at
services
marking
the
th
anniversary
of
the
deadly
bombing
of
birmingham's
th
street
baptist
church
in
what
was
at
times
a
deeply
personal
address
biden
spoke
of
the
losses
he
has
faced
in
life
to
sympathize
with
the
community
in
birmingham
as
they
remember
four
young
girls
killed
the
birmingham
attack
he
spoke
of
how
the
domestic
terror
attack
here
laid
bare
the
lie
that
a
child
could
be
free
in
america
while
oppression's
long
shadow
darkened
our
cities
and
ruled
our
countryside
biden
highlighted
prominent
hate
crimes
of
the
past
decade
including
the
white
supremacist
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
the
mass
shooting
at
a
historic
black
church
in
charleston
south
carolina
and
the
mass
shooting
at
a
pittsburgh
synagogue
as
proof
that
violence
does
not
live
in
the
past
the
domestic
terrorism
of
white
supremacy
has
been
the
antagonist
of
our
highest
ideals
from
before
the
founding
of
this
country
biden
said
lynch
mobs
arsonists
bomb
makers
lone
gunmen
and
as
we
all
now
realize
this
violence
does
not
live
in
the
past
the
former
vice
president
said
the
u.s.
has
yet
to
live
up
to
its
promise
of
equality
for
all
and
that
any
silence
in
the
face
of
such
hatred
is
complicity
he
repeated
an
assertion
he
made
at
the
onset
of
his
campaign
that
the
country
is
in
a
battle
for
the
soul
of
america
now
hate
is
on
the
rise
again
and
we're
at
a
defining
moment
again
in
american
history
biden
said
the
former
vice
president
talked
about
his
own
journey
into
public
service
inspired
by
the
civil
rights
movement
and
how
the
attack
in
birmingham
helped
us
realize
working
on
the
fringes
of
the
movement
was
not
enough
he
said
he
became
a
public
defender
and
ultimately
ran
for
office
because
of
it
and
the
response
to
the
assassination
of
mlk
biden
said
he
believed
that
as
racial
violence
inspired
the
civil
rights
movement
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
landmark
civil
rights
act
and
voting
rights
act
in
the
mid-
s
americans
are
ready
to
take
another
step
in
response
to
recent
hate
he
said
that
while
those
of
us
are
white
try
but
we
can
never
fully
fully
understand
the
struggle
black
americans
have
faced
we
have
to
work
to
bring
this
country
together
the
vice
president
who
served
alongside
the
nation's
first
black
president
enjoys
strong
support
from
black
voters
but
his
speech
comes
as
he
himself
has
been
scrutinized
for
his
legislative
record
on
busing
and
criminal
justice
and
his
past
statements
on
racial
issues
this
summer
biden
has
come
under
criticism
for
june
comments
fundraiser
about
his
past
work
with
segregationist
senators
decades
ago
and
more
recently
for
an
answer
he
delivered
at
thursday's
presidential
debate
in
response
to
a
question
about
reparations
and
the
lasting
effect
of
slavery
biden
responded
in
part
that
social
workers
are
needed
to
help
parents
deal
with
how
to
raise
their
children
because
they
don't
know
quite
what
to
do
suggesting
solutions
such
as
keeping
a
record
player
on
at
night
so
that
young
children
can
learn
more
words
