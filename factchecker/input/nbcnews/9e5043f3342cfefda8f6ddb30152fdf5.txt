for
tuesday

that
is

to
tackle
next
steps
in
the
impeachment
inquiry
washington
house
democrats
began
a
potentially
pivotal
week
on
capitol
hill
monday
as
frustration
mounted
within
the
caucus
over
the
slow
pace
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
process
against
president
donald
trump
rank-and-file
members
demanded
the
release
of
a
recent
intelligence
community
whistleblower
complaint
against
the
president
the
pressure
on
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
to
accelerate
the
methodical
investigation
into
the
president
and
his
administration
a
pace
she
has
argued
is
necessary
to
build
a
case
strong
enough
to
win
over
public
support
on
impeachment
has
dramatically
escalated
over
the
past
week
after
democrats
were
told
that
the
whistleblower's
complaint
would
not
be
released
to
congress
as
required
by
law
house
leadership
called
a
members-only
caucus
meeting
for
tuesday
afternoon
that
is
expected
to
tackle
next
steps
in
both
the
impeachment
inquiry
and
the
various
congressional
investigations
involving
trump
multiple
sources
told
nbc
news
on
sunday
pelosi
hinted
that
democrats
might
expedite
their
investigation
writing
in
a
letter
to
the
caucus
that
they
may
be
entering
a
whole
new
stage
this
came
after
she
told
npr
on
friday
that
she
had
not
changed
her
position
on
impeachment
if
the
administration
persists
in
blocking
this
whistleblower
from
disclosing
to
congress
a
serious
possible
breach
of
constitutional
duties
by
the
president
they
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
she
wrote
in
the
letter
sent
sunday
she
added
that
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
would
need
to
hand
over
the
whistleblower's
complaint
to
congress
when
he
testifies
about
the
matter
at
a
public
hearing
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
we
also
expect
that
he
will
establish
a
path
for
the
whistleblower
to
speak
directly
to
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
committees
as
required
by
law
she
said
on
monday
rep
david
cicilline
d-r
i.
a
member
of
house
democratic
leadership
and
the
house
judiciary
committee
said
democrats
should
move
forward
quickly
with
impeachment
if
maguire
doesn't
turn
over
the
complaint
that's
independent
grounds
to
file
articles
of
impeachment
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
with
nbc
news
monday
that
relates
to
this
ongoing
obstruction
and
stonewalling
on
sunday
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
appeared
to
shift
his
approach
toward
impeachment
breaking
with
pelosi's
cautious
stance
saying
that
he
had
been
very
reluctant
to
go
down
the
path
but
with
the
president's
recent
actions
we
may
very
well
have
crossed
the
rubicon
here
if
the
president
is
essentially
withholding
military
aid
to
ukraine
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
trying
to
browbeat
a
foreign
leader
into
doing
something
illicit
that
is
providing
dirt
on
his
opponent
during
a
presidential
campaign
then
that
may
be
the
only
remedy
that
is
co-equal
to
the
evil
that
that
conduct
represents
schiff
said
in
an
interview
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
while
congress
has
been
blocked
from
learning
the
contents
of
the
complaint
the
new
york
times
and
other
outlets
have
reported
that
a
phone
call
between
trump
and
ukraine's
leader
led
to
the
complaint
which
the
washington
post
reported
focuses
on
a
promise
trump
made
rep
ro
khanna
d-calif
noted
the
evolving
tone
from
house
leaders
there
has
been
a
shift
he
said
on
msnbc's
kasie
dc
sunday
and
i
think
congressman
schiff
in
particular
talking
about
impeachment
is
a
big
deal
i
mean
if
these
allegations
are
true
it's
a
clear
abuse
of
the
president's
office
rep
harley
rouda
d-calif
noted
the
rising
pressure
within
the
caucus
for
action
as
this
continues
to
build
as
we
see
one
activity
after
another
with
clear
signs
of
corruption
you
are
going
to
see
more
and
more
people
within
the
democratic
caucus
come
to
the
side
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
he
said
on
kasie
dc
khanna
said
he
expected
the
house
judiciary
committee
will
refer
something
to
the
house
the
panel
is
currently
exploring
as
part
of
its
impeachment
inquiry
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
against
the
president
to
the
full
house
the
pressure
for
action
from
some
democratic
lawmakers
was
rising
fast
as
the
week
began
late
saturday
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
criticized
democratic
leaders
for
not
yet
moving
to
impeach
trump
at
this
point
the
bigger
national
scandal
isn't
the
president's
lawbreaking
behavior
it
is
the
democratic
party's
refusal
to
impeach
him
for
it
she
tweeted
it
wasn't
the
only
vocal
expression
of
frustration
from
within
the
caucus
over
the
past
several
days
on
monday
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
and
al
green
d-texas
joined
the
youth-led
group
by
the
people
to
demand
that
the
house
take
immediate
action
toward
impeaching
trump
he
is
jeopardizing
endangering
our
democracy
every
single
day
tlaib
said
at
the
event
we
have
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
was
filed
by
a
member
of
the
intelligence
community
and
the
director
of
the
intelligence
blocked
it
from
being
shared
to
the
united
states
congress
violating
the
law
enough
is
enough
asked
if
pelosi
is
doing
enough
as
speaker
green
said
the
question
is
if
congress
is
doing
enough
rep
pramila
jayapal
d-wash
a
co-chair
of
the
congressional
progressive
caucus
said
monday
that
democrats
are
becoming
more
frustrated
with
the
litigation
strategy
of
investigating
the
president
i
think
you're
going
to
see
in
the
caucus
what
i'm
already
seeing
there
are
many
who
are
realizing
that
this
president
is
going
to
tie
things
up
in
court
he
won't
accept
any
lower
court
rulings
jayapal
said
before
adding
that
the
court
cases
are
taking
too
much
time
jayapal
who
is
supportive
of
impeachment
said
that
democrats
should
be
wary
of
waiting
for
the
next
explosive
thing
to
help
make
the
case
for
impeachment
she
says
the
president's
own
words
are
enough
to
move
to
impeachment
the
smoking
gun
is
donald
trump
jayapal
said
and
we
have
to
be
careful
about
continually
looking
for
the
smoking
gun
he
is
shooting
that
gun
off
in
public
almost
every
single
day
before
last
week's
hearing
with
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
an
impassioned
rep
jackie
speier
d-calif
told
nbc
news
that
democrats
should
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
and
that
if
they
are
unwilling
to
do
so
democrats
should
stop
investigating
then
friday
during
a
meeting
of
judiciary
committee
democrats
two
democratic
aides
say
committee
leadership
tried
to
calm
members
who
were
angry
that
the
committee
didn't
hold
him
in
contempt
on
the
spot
during
the
hearing
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
only
threatened
to
do
so
after
lewandowski
stonewalled
democrats
questions
for
several
hours
more
than
half
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
has
voiced
support
for
the
impeachment
inquiry
already
underway
nadler
used
that
process
to
explain
why
leaders
would
be
unable
to
also
launch
a
simultaneous
impeachment
process
against
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
amid
new
allegations
we
have
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
right
now
and
that's
going
to
take
up
our
limited
resources
and
time
for
a
while
he
said
in
an
interview
last
week
meanwhile
in
the
senate
on
monday
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
called
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
and
gop
committee
chairmen
to
take
immediate
action
to
secure
the
whistleblower's
complaint
the
republican
senate's
see
no
evil
hear
no
evil
attitude
toward
such
a
serious
national
security
concern
is
unacceptable
and
must
change
schumer
wrote
in
a
letter
to
the
gop
leaders
calling
on
them
to
take
action
the
gop
has
largely
stayed
silent
regarding
the
whistleblower
complaint
with
several
members
defending
the
president
though
sen
mitt
romney
of
utah
became
the
first
republican
on
sunday
to
express
grave
concern
about
the
emerging
details
of
the
complaint
if
the
president
asked
or
pressured
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
his
political
rival
either
directly
or
through
his
personal
attorney
it
would
be
troubling
in
the
extreme
critical
for
the
facts
to
come
out
he
tweeted
