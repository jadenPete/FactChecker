share
this
buttigieg
and
o'rourke
fight
to
reinvigorate
their
presidential
campaigns
as
they
head
into
thursday's
debate
pete
buttigieg
and
beto
o'rourke
are
trying
to
recapture
the
early
excitement
of
their
early
campaign
days
when
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
descended
on
new
hampshire
last
weekend
beto
o'rourke
returned
to
the
campus
where
just
months
earlier
he'd
packed
hundreds
onto
multiple
floors
of
keene
state
college's
red-bricked
student
center
this
time
the
students
and
locals
who
came
to
hear
the
former
texas
congressman
friday
barely
filled
half
the
room
yet
when
asked
whether
the
deflated
turnout
was
disappointing
o'rourke
was
undeterred
i'm
really
grateful
for
everyone
who
would
forego
a
perfectly
fine
meal
or
a
dinner
date
to
spend
some
time
on
a
friday
night
with
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
o'rourke
said
halfway
across
the
country
pete
buttigieg
was
hitting
the
iowa
airwaves
with
the
first
tv
ads
of
his
campaign
deploying
some
of
the
eye-popping
million
he
raised
in
a
mere
three-month
span
but
he
too
was
fending
off
growing
concerns
that
his
campaign
once
an
unlikely
juggernaut
was
losing
steam
you
kind
of
got
lost
mayor
pete
said
radio
host
charlamagne
tha
god
as
he
interviewed
the
south
bend
indiana
mayor
on
his
show
the
breakfast
club
putting
a
finer
point
on
buttigieg's
performance
in
the
first
debates
he
added
do
you
think
you
sucked
two
boyish
democrats
from
conservative
states
with
their
eyes
on
the
oval
office
buttigieg
and
o'rourke
both
once
took
the
political
scene
by
storm
offering
a
fresh
face
and
innovative
tactics
in
a
field
dominated
by
septuagenarians
and
longtime
washington
denizens
now
as
they
prepare
to
participate
in
thursday
night's
presidential
debate
both
find
themselves
struggling
to
maintain
relevance
in
a
primary
field
led
by
three
front-runners
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
as
they
seek
to
reinvigorate
their
campaigns
buttigieg's
and
o'rourke's
contrasting
approaches
offer
a
window
into
the
broader
tension
pulsing
through
the
primary
whether
to
nominate
a
safe
choice
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
at
any
cost
or
hold
out
for
a
more
inspiring
unconventional
candidate
who
can
carry
the
democratic
party
into
the
future
ben
labolt
who
worked
on
both
of
former
president
barack
obama's
campaigns
said
both
buttigieg
and
o'rourke
are
campaigning
as
outsiders
and
generational
change
agents
skewering
the
traditional
rules
of
campaigning
and
thrusting
themselves
in
front
of
audiences
that
other
candidates
are
not
can
there
only
be
one
candidate
in
that
lane
over
time
labolt
said
yes
but
there
can
only
be
one
nominee
too
for
o'rourke
the
challenge
is
to
re-insert
himself
into
a
conversation
where
he
once
dominated
after
surging
into
double
digits
in
multiple
polls
in
march
he's
seen
his
numbers
dwindle
to
the
low
single
digits
notching
just
percent
in
a
new
washington
post-abc
news
poll
his
new
strategy
includes
abandoning
the
typical
laser-like
focus
on
iowa
and
new
hampshire
in
favor
of
a
guerilla-style
campaign
aimed
at
non-traditional
voters
in
unlikely
places
in
the
wake
of
a
devastating
mass
shooting
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
o'rourke
has
sought
to
reorient
his
campaign
squarely
around
the
issue
of
gun
control
hoping
that
if
he
can't
stand
above
his
competitors
at
least
he
can
stand
apart
buttigieg's
challenge
is
more
difficult
to
diagnose
flush
with
campaign
cash
he
raised
more
between
april
and
june
than
any
other
candidate
buttigieg
is
attracting
impressive
crowds
that
rival
those
of
the
front-runners
but
that
tangible
enthusiasm
on
the
campaign
trail
is
not
showing
up
when
pollsters
ask
who
voters
plan
to
pick
next
year
unlike
o'rourke
buttigieg
has
doubled
down
on
his
early-state
playbook
investing
as
much
as
possible
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
in
hopes
that
a
strong
showing
in
the
first
two
states
will
catapult
him
forward
next
year
as
the
race
thins
out
as
our
message
continues
to
land
i
think
that
we've
got
the
right
game
plan
to
consolidate
our
position
toward
the
top
and
make
our
way
to
the
nomination
buttigieg
told
nbc
news
in
a
recent
interview
while
campaigning
in
tipton
iowa
but
it's
not
going
to
happen
overnight
and
we
can't
get
too
caught
up
with
changes
from
week
to
week
in
poll
numbers
if
buttigieg's
path
to
victory
relies
on
patience
it's
one
borne
out
by
primary
voters
who
say
the
large
remaining
field
of
candidates
is
clouding
their
decision
kara
ewinger
an
iowa
resident
who
worked
for
former
president
obama's
and
campaigns
said
she
wasn't
sure
why
buttigieg's
poll
numbers
lag
so
far
behind
his
fundraising
and
crowd
sizes
but
surmised
it
was
because
when
it
comes
to
candidates
there's
just
so
many
to
choose
from
maybe
something
to
do
with
age
experience
not
knowing
enough
about
him
ewinger
said
of
the
millenial
mayor
after
hearing
his
stump
speech
for
the
first
time
in
burlington
iowa
although
undecided
she
added
all
they
have
to
do
is
come
listen
to
him
live
and
they
can
see
that
he
can
take
on
trump
o'rourke
who
had
burst
onto
the
national
stage
in
by
nearly
ousting
gop
sen
ted
cruz
crested
almost
immediately
after
entering
the
race
in
march
just
a
month
later
buttigieg
jumped
into
the
race
and
quickly
surged
past
of
nearly
other
competitors
into
third
place
in
new
hampshire
and
iowa
stealing
o'rourke's
thunder
and
perhaps
some
of
his
supporters
as
well
but
that
was
april
soon
a
fatal
shooting
of
a
black
man
by
a
south
bend
police
officer
and
an
ensuing
community
uproar
helped
crystalize
buttigieg's
challenge
in
appealing
to
black
voters
who
play
a
critical
role
in
the
democratic
primary
a
obstacle
buttigieg
has
yet
to
prove
he
can
overcome
months
later
the
forces
of
political
gravity
have
pulled
buttigieg
into
fifth
place
and
single
digits
even
as
he
builds
out
a
massive
campaign
infrastructure
of
more
than
people
eager
to
dispel
the
notion
that
he's
peaked
buttigieg's
aides
have
cast
his
current
interlude
away
from
the
limelight
as
part
of
the
plan
all
along
his
campaign
has
said
the
next
phase
of
his
effort
entails
ramping
up
a
campaign
capable
of
carrying
him
to
victory
by
converting
enthusiasm
into
actual
votes
this
month
he
opened
dozens
of
offices
in
the
early
states
and
now
has
more
in
new
hampshire
than
anyone
else
although
the
unflappable
small-town
mayor
and
the
frenetic
profanity-prone
texan
are
stylistic
opposites
it's
not
lost
on
some
voters
that
buttigieg
and
o'rourke
cross
into
similar
territory
when
it
comes
to
offering
a
break
from
the
status
quo
i've
been
really
looking
hard
at
beto
o'rourke
and
buttigieg
because
they
are
younger
michael
overacker
an
independent
said
after
hearing
o'rourke
speak
recently
in
bland
virginia
i
really
think
they
need
some
young
blood
in
politics
now
the
stop
in
bland
county
in
the
most
pro-trump
stretch
of
virginia
in
mirrored
others
o'rouke
has
made
in
reliably
conservative
states
in
recent
weeks
he's
also
visited
arkansas
where
he
touted
the
need
for
background
checks
while
at
a
gun
show
and
mississippi
where
immigration
was
his
focus
as
he
spoke
at
a
latino
grocery
store
blocks
from
a
food
processing
plant
recently
raided
by
u.s.
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
along
the
way
o'rourke
and
his
campaign
have
emphasized
his
unwillingness
to
write
anyone
off
it's
the
old
beto
really
former
obama
strategist
david
axelrod
noted
on
his
podcast
hacks
on
tap
he's
behaving
now
like
he
was
in
the
senate
race
he's
filled
with
a
moral
outrage
his
campaign
insists
it's
paying
off
o'rourke
press
secretary
aleigha
cavalier
told
nbc
news
that
his
online
fundraising
and
social
media
engagements
are
both
on
the
rise
the
post-el
paso
o'rourke
has
also
appeared
unburdened
by
typical
candidate
rhetorical
expectations
his
description
of
the
recent
mass
shooting
in
odessa
as
f-
ed
up
caused
some
pearl
clutching
among
washington
political
observers
but
the
campaign
doubled
down
it's
just
honest
and
i
think
it
describes
the
situation
o'rourke
told
cnn's
christiane
amanpour
we
have
to
shake
ourselves
out
of
this
complacency
we
have
to
shock
the
conscience
of
this
country
we
have
to
force
us
to
act
decisively
