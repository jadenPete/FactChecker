share
this
pelosi's
foregone
conclusion
problem
on
impeachment
analysis
it
seems
the
house
speaker
has
already
concluded
that
trump
betrayed
his
country
she
and
house
democrats
still
need
to
persuade
voters
washington
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
may
have
created
a
foregone
conclusion
problem
for
democrats
the
california
lawmaker
declared
president
donald
trump
guilty
tuesday
as
she
told
colleagues
that
the
house
should
complete
a
formal
investigation
into
his
conduct
in
speedy
fashion
trump
committed
a
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
national
security
and
election
integrity
by
urging
ukraine's
president
to
investigate
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
she
said
in
a
closed-door
meeting
of
the
democratic
caucus
a
summary
of
a
call
between
trump
and
russian
president
volodomyr
zelenskiy
released
by
the
white
house
on
wednesday
confirmed
that
the
request
happened
at
the
same
time
trump
was
withholding
aid
to
ukraine
trump's
solicitation
of
foreign
help
to
hurt
a
political
opponent
again
became
a
tipping
point
for
many
democrats
including
pelosi
now
the
speaker
seems
to
have
already
concluded
that
trump
betrayed
his
country
but
she
appeared
to
betray
something
about
motives
having
little
to
do
with
the
principles
of
justice
due
process
and
the
rule
of
law
that
the
president's
critics
fault
him
for
failing
to
honor
or
the
hour
diner
menu
of
impeachment
options
he
has
given
democrats
since
he
took
office
if
none
of
that
had
occurred
what
has
happened
this
week
is
grievous
and
serious
with
our
constitution
and
so
we
must
it
is
understandable
to
the
public
it
has
clarity
in
terms
of
what
he
did
she
told
democrats
according
to
excerpts
of
her
remarks
provided
to
nbc
by
a
senior
democratic
aide
who
was
in
the
room
right
now
we
must
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
in
other
words
don't
bore
the
people
with
a
trial
get
to
the
verdict
while
they're
still
paying
attention
democrats
are
reluctant
to
criticize
pelosi
publicly
both
in
general
and
particularly
amid
an
impeachment
frenzy
in
their
party
but
they
fret
privately
about
the
prospects
of
how
their
party
will
handle
republican
questions
about
the
bidens
during
an
impeachment
inquiry
whether
trump
would
be
more
likely
to
pay
a
price
for
seeking
political
help
from
ukraine
than
receiving
assistance
from
russia
during
the
election
and
what
the
plan
is
for
convincing
voters
that
impeaching
him
is
simply
the
right
thing
to
do
chris
kofinis
a
democratic
strategist
who
has
worked
on
presidential
campaigns
and
conducts
research
on
political
messaging
and
public
opinion
stopped
short
of
critiquing
pelosi's
tack
but
he
acknowledged
in
a
telephone
interview
with
nbc
news
that
it
may
not
be
as
obvious
to
voters
as
it
seems
to
democratic
lawmakers
that
trump's
conduct
merits
impeachment
given
the
historic
nature
of
this
action
there's
going
to
be
a
significant
responsibility
on
us
to
explain
to
the
american
people
exactly
what
he
did
wrong
kofinis
said
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
he
is
guilty
what
we
want
to
do
is
avoid
making
him
a
martyr
the
cautious
pelosi
who
once
warned
against
basing
impeachment
decisions
on
political
calculations
has
been
replaced
by
a
version
determined
to
lead
her
party's
charge
into
a
constitutional
showdown
with
trump
rather
than
get
trampled
by
it
in
doing
so
she
seemed
to
abandon
the
solemnity
she
had
observed
for
eight
months
as
rank-and-file
liberals
clamored
for
blood
and
grab
the
biggest
torch
she
could
find
but
in
political
terms
the
house's
target
audience
in
this
process
is
still
swing
voters
the
set
that
could
either
sway
congressional
republicans
on
impeachment
unlikely
or
punish
the
gop
at
the
ballot
box
but
there's
a
pretty
big
risk
in
a
scenario
that
some
see
as
democrats
bum-rushing
trump
for
partisan
gain
rather
than
seeking
justice
for
the
public
if
the
president
did
this
it's
an
impeachable
offense
and
everyone
should
take
it
seriously
said
kristen
hawn
a
democratic
consultant
who
has
long
worked
with
moderate
blue
dog
lawmakers
but
hawn
added
there
might
be
a
better
way
to
pursue
the
facts
members
should
establish
a
bipartisan
select
committee
to
look
into
what
the
president
did
or
didn't
do
with
regard
to
ukraine
she
said
pelosi
declined
to
take
that
step
tuesday
it
has
been
all
but
inevitable
since
at
least
the
release
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
which
detailed
evidence
he
found
that
trump
may
have
obstructed
justice
that
the
house
would
move
to
impeach
trump
the
manner
and
timing
have
been
more
in
doubt
ron
bonjean
a
founder
of
the
public
relations
firm
rokk
solutions
and
a
house
gop
aide
during
the
impeachment
of
president
bill
clinton
said
impeachment
will
now
overshadow
everything
else
pelosi
is
trying
to
get
done
and
to
her
disadvantage
by
endorsing
an
official
impeachment
inquiry
speaker
pelosi
has
greatly
risked
turning
the
democratic
agenda
into
a
singular
focus
of
removing
president
trump
from
office
he
said
she
has
allowed
president
trump
and
republicans
to
call
out
the
democratic
leadership
for
focusing
on
partisanship
instead
of
creating
bipartisan
solutions
thus
handing
them
political
gift
for
the
elections
but
pelosi
has
opted
not
to
waste
what
democrats
describe
as
momentum
for
impeachment
no
one
really
knows
how
the
politics
of
impeachment
will
ultimately
play
out
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
senate
will
vote
to
remove
trump
and
it
is
unclear
what
effect
if
any
a
house
vote
to
impeach
him
would
have
on
his
re-election
prospects
even
as
trump's
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
boasted
that
it
would
backfire
on
democrats
and
end
in
a
landslide
victory
for
trump
in
there
was
some
concern
about
the
potential
impact
in
the
president's
inner
circle
perhaps
the
substance
will
matter
more
than
the
politics
but
pelosi
is
staking
herself
to
the
politics
right
now
and
her
cart-before-the-horse
judgment
looked
likely
to
make
it
harder
for
democrats
to
defend
themselves
against
trump's
charge
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
witch
hunt
even
if
the
evidence
against
him
proves
to
demand
impeachment
as
many
democrats
now
contend
that
it
does
the
process
might
have
been
perceived
by
the
public
as
more
legitimate
if
pelosi
had
framed
the
house's
upcoming
work
as
an
investigation
rather
than
an
impeachment
inquiry
and
if
she
hadn't
reached
a
foregone
conclusion
about
whether
his
conduct
rises
to
the
level
of
impeachment
said
one
house
democrat
who
spoke
to
nbc
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
out
of
fear
of
reprisal
from
pelosi
as
recently
as
monday
afternoon
democratic
lawmakers
and
aides
were
predicting
that
there
would
be
a
sea
change
in
impeachment
sentiment
if
the
director
of
national
intelligence
refused
to
provide
the
full
whistleblower
complaint
on
trump's
interactions
with
ukraine
during
a
house
intelligence
committee
hearing
thursday
by
tuesday
morning
the
tide
already
had
turned
in
favor
of
moving
on
trump
before
the
hearing
a
reflection
in
part
of
a
belief
that
what
he
had
already
acknowledged
publicly
about
his
contacts
with
ukraine
was
bad
enough
without
whatever
lay
beneath
the
surface
in
the
complaint
the
democrats
after
all
are
still
smarting
from
trump's
public
courting
of
russia's
help
which
he
got
in
the
last
election
they
think
that
was
an
america-second
trump-first
move
now
the
trump
administration
is
expected
to
release
at
least
some
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
in
addition
to
the
transcript
pelosi
told
democrats
to
ignore
the
debate
over
whether
there
was
an
explicitly
stated
quid
pro
quo
in
the
president
withholding
aid
for
ukraine
while
he
and
his
team
were
pushing
for
an
investigation
into
hunter
biden
don't
get
caught
in
the
trap
of
oh
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
she
said
no
he
asked
for
assistance
from
the
foreign
government
that
is
wrong
that
is
his
actions
are
impeachable
in
her
view
even
if
they
don't
involve
the
legal
definition
of
extortion
or
bribery
moments
later
she
referred
to
trump's
betrayal
of
the
constitution
as
her
rationale
for
proceeding
with
the
impeachment
inquiry
in
the
federalist
papers
alexander
hamilton
defined
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
one
category
of
misdeeds
for
which
a
president
may
be
impeached
as
those
offences
which
proceed
from
the
misconduct
of
public
men
or
in
other
words
from
the
abuse
or
violation
of
some
public
trust
pelosi's
term
betrayal
is
perhaps
a
harsher
substitute
for
violation
but
her
construction
is
parallel
to
the
violation
of
some
public
trust
that
hamilton
foresaw
still
in
the
end
it
might
ultimately
be
most
important
to
ensure
the
public
doesn't
view
the
process
as
a
witch
trial
the
lawmaker
who
spoke
to
nbc
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
worried
that
crucial
swing
voters
are
not
particularly
tuned
into
the
ukraine
story
line
and
will
see
the
impeachment
now
as
partisan
warfare
the
rush
to
impeach
this
lawmaker
said
is
silly
momentum
