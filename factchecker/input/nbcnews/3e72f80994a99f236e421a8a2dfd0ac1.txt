share
this
sanders
campaign
starts
new
phase
focusing
on
minorities
early
states
amid
staff
shakeup
the
changes
including
a
hiring
spree
coincide
with
the
post-labor
day
start
of
the
fall
season
when
undecided
and
unaffiliated
voters
begin
to
tune
in
charleston
s.c.
when
bernie
sanders
took
the
stage
sunday
evening
in
south
carolina
things
were
different
the
senator's
staff
usually
scrambled
to
keep
him
on
his
busy
schedule
but
this
was
his
only
public
event
of
the
day
the
vermont
independent
and
self-described
democratic
socialist
took
the
advice
of
his
aides
canceling
events
and
appearances
to
go
home
and
rest
his
raspy
voice
he
would
be
off
the
trail
but
only
for
a
day
i've
been
giving
too
many
speeches
lately
sanders
told
nbc
news
on
saturday
flashing
a
smile
after
his
campaign
canceled
the
events
i
forget
that
microphones
work
pretty
well
the
brief
hiatus
was
a
sign
of
the
physical
toll
a
presidential
campaign
takes
but
it's
also
a
reflection
of
the
increased
intensity
level
of
his
campaign
as
it
enters
a
new
phase
now
the
big
rallies
are
back
last
monday
ahead
of
the
democratic
presidential
primary
debate
upward
of
people
packed
into
a
park
for
an
evening
rally
in
denver
the
capital
of
the
competitive
super
tuesday
state
of
colorado
the
campaign
has
rarely
held
rallies
of
this
magnitude
in
the
summer
months
opting
instead
for
smaller
more
personal
events
targeted
towards
specific
audiences
or
topics
there
has
been
a
hiring
spree
and
a
staff
shakeup
in
the
early
states
sanders
new
hampshire
director
is
moving
to
massachusetts
and
new
campaign
officials
have
been
brought
in
to
lead
operations
in
maine
and
new
hampshire
there's
also
a
surge
in
new
field
staff
a
hundred
staff
will
assist
the
campaign
in
iowa
in
the
next
few
weeks
and
nationwide
the
campaign
will
include
well
over
personnel
advisers
say
the
boost
in
staff
complements
a
shift
in
focus
the
campaign
will
home
in
on
the
first
four
caucus
and
primary
states
plus
delegate-rich
california
a
senior
adviser
says
but
this
will
likely
come
at
a
cost
to
candidate
forums
featuring
many
candidates
delivering
quick
stump
speeches
outside
those
key
states
another
aide
adds
campaign
officials
have
also
signaled
that
talks
are
well
underway
to
expand
early
state
media
advertising
beyond
the
digital
space
to
radio
and
television
the
changes
coincide
with
what
political
operatives
consider
a
key
marker
in
presidential
electoral
politics
labor
day
the
unofficial
start
of
the
fall
season
is
when
many
undecided
and
unaffiliated
voters
truly
begin
to
tune
in
after
summer
vacations
have
ended
schools
are
back
in
session
and
americans
have
returned
to
their
standard
routines
political
observers
and
operatives
say
for
sanders
whose
presidential
campaign
four
years
ago
challenged
hillary
clinton
for
the
democratic
nomination
the
landscape
at
this
key
point
is
much
different
as
are
the
resources
at
his
disposal
at
this
point
in
sanders
had
a
staff
of
about
according
to
jeff
weaver
who
ran
his
campaign
and
is
a
senior
adviser
to
his
current
operation
while
there
have
been
three
debates
so
far
this
cycle
the
first
debate
in
the
then
largely
unknown
candidate'a
previous
run
didn't
come
until
mid-october
in
that
race
the
campaign
didn't
have
a
full
time
air
charter
service
until
after
the
iowa
caucuses
this
time
around
sanders
team
is
taking
advantage
of
that
service
putting
him
on
fewer
commercial
flights
as
the
campaign
intensifies
it
becomes
logistically
impossible
to
go
everywhere
we
need
to
go
without
one
weaver
told
nbc
news
despite
the
added
resources
sanders
faces
similar
headwinds
in
trying
to
expand
his
base
beyond
his
strong
and
active
core
group
of
supporters
he's
been
unable
for
now
two
presidential
runs
to
diversify
his
support
beyond
the
demographics
of
his
populist
progressive
base
said
joe
trippi
a
longtime
democratic
strategist
who
ran
howard
dean's
presidential
campaign
sanders
momentum
was
thwarted
after
losing
in
the
more
diverse
contests
in
south
carolina
and
nevada
if
i
were
internally
with
them
that
would
be
something
i'd
be
very
very
worried
about
in
this
field
because
there
are
so
many
other
candidates
who
have
the
ability
to
do
that
trippi
said
trippi
acknowledged
the
campaign's
efforts
to
fix
the
issue
through
an
emphasis
on
outreach
to
minority
voters
and
campaign
aides
said
they
think
sanders
is
making
progress
the
campaign
and
sometimes
the
candidate
himself
regularly
touts
polling
to
suggest
the
strategy
is
working
including
a
pre-debate
polling
memo
that
they
say
showed
sanders
leading
nationally
with
latino
voters
in
the
crowded
primary
field
the
memo
included
recent
polls
from
cnn
and
univision
showing
sanders
about
even
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
in
support
from
hispanic
voters
among
african
americans
sanders
trails
behind
biden
but
he
is
doing
well
with
younger
black
voters
with
one
poll
showing
him
running
about
even
with
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
in
support
among
young
black
women
the
campaign's
efforts
also
show
in
its
schedule
nevada
and
south
carolina
were
the
first
two
states
sanders
campaigned
in
after
the
september
democratic
debate
in
las
vegas
sanders
led
an
invitation-only
town
hall
focused
entirely
on
latinx
issues
in
recent
weeks
he's
hosted
topical
events
for
union
workers
on
climate
change
and
on
medicare
for
all
issues
the
campaign
says
appeals
to
broad
demographics
despite
having
to
cancel
appearances
at
several
south
carolina
events
to
rest
his
hoarse
voice
sanders
is
already
scheduled
to
return
to
the
south
next
weekend
for
events
at
three
historically
black
colleges
another
post-labor
day
change
as
students
begin
the
fall
semester
sanders
is
taking
advantage
of
the
high
concentration
of
young
people
on
college
and
university
campuses
kicking
off
campus
tours
this
month
aimed
at
a
demographic
group
that
the
campaign
is
relying
on
in
order
to
succeed
speaking
to
nbc
news
at
a
labor
day
parade
sanders
acknowledged
an
increase
in
the
intensity
of
this
race
but
he
believes
he
has
a
key
advantage
we
have
a
lot
of
grassroots
energy
we
have
a
lot
volunteers
he
said
standing
in
front
of
a
group
of
volunteers
marching
with
him
in
milford
new
hampshire
what
really
matters
is
voter
turnout
what
matters
is
the
kind
of
enthusiasm
and
energy
you
have
and
i'm
feeling
pretty
good
about
that
