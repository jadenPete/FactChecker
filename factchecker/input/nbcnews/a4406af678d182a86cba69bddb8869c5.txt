and
allies
mull
next
steps
when
the
california
senator
returns
to
iowa
this
weekend
for
the
polk
county
democrats
steak
fry
it'll
be
her
first
trip
to
the
state
in
over
a
month
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
once
viewed
as
a
top-tier
contender
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
has
lost
considerable
ground
in
the
crowded
field
while
other
candidates
are
picking
up
steam
with
just
over
four
months
left
until
iowa's
leadoff
caucuses
harris
has
fallen
to
percent
support
in
the
latest
nbc
wsj
poll
released
tuesday
putting
her
in
fifth
place
behind
former
vice
president
joe
biden
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
and
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
it's
a
precipitous
drop
for
the
former
california
attorney
general
who
entered
the
presidential
race
with
a
huge
rally
in
her
hometown
of
oakland
in
january
she
jumped
to
prominence
after
the
first
nationally
televised
democratic
debate
in
june
where
she
called
out
biden
the
field's
front-runner
over
his
past
statements
on
public
school
busing
harris
has
faded
since
then
her
second
debate
performance
in
july
was
panned
as
she
defended
her
record
as
a
prosecutor
and
worked
to
explain
her
position
on
health
care
reform
she
did
little
to
bounce
in
the
third
debate
this
month
casting
much
of
her
attention
toward
president
donald
trump
and
she's
had
a
light
campaign
schedule
this
summer
when
harris
returns
to
iowa
this
weekend
for
the
polk
county
democrats
steak
fry
it'll
be
her
first
trip
to
the
state
in
over
a
month
she's
visited
just
of
iowa's
counties
so
far
it's
been
more
than
two
months
since
her
last
visit
to
south
carolina
where
harris
who
is
african
american
is
counting
on
a
robust
showing
among
black
voters
who
make
up
the
majority
of
the
state's
democratic
primary
voters
and
harris
has
been
in
new
hampshire
just
once
in
the
last
two
months
by
comparison
biden
has
campaigned
actively
in
the
early
contest
states
since
aug
the
former
vice
president
has
been
to
iowa
three
times
new
hampshire
twice
and
south
carolina
twice
he's
also
been
to
of
iowa's
counties
despite
having
entered
the
race
in
april
three
months
after
harris
and
through
the
summer
warren
has
held
well-attended
rallies
in
st
paul
minn
seattle
oakland
austin
texas
and
new
york
city
harris
however
has
spent
much
of
the
summer
on
a
fundraising
spree
she
held
fundraising
events
in
chicago
and
new
york
city
last
weekend
and
skipped
a
major
labor
summit
in
philadelphia
on
tuesday
to
raise
money
in
the
baltimore
area
instead
harris
advisers
say
she
will
continue
to
make
fundraising
a
priority
before
the
sept
third-quarter
fundraising
deadline
the
california
senator
raised
million
in
the
second
quarter
less
than
biden
warren
sanders
and
buttigieg
with
falling
poll
numbers
and
a
sparse
campaign
schedule
harris
is
in
need
of
a
healthy
fundraising
haul
to
sustain
a
robust
operation
heading
into
the
winter
campaign
spokesman
ian
sams
told
nbc
that
the
campaign
wants
to
make
sure
we
have
the
nest
egg
to
be
competitive
and
viable
through
march
and
insisted
the
candidate
will
be
on
the
trail
a
lot
more
come
october
we're
not
playing
to
win
a
summer
news
cycle
in
the
off-year
sams
said
we're
playing
to
win
an
election
we're
aiming
to
peak
at
the
turn
of
the
year
when
we're
approaching
votes
and
we're
built
to
do
that
horse-race
polling
be
damned
he
added
but
part
of
her
struggles
comes
down
to
voters
lack
of
familiarity
with
harris
who
is
only
in
her
third
year
in
the
senate
in
the
new
nbc
wsj
poll
percent
of
democratic
primary
voters
said
they
didn't
know
her
name
by
comparison
just
percent
said
that
about
warren
and
percent
said
that
about
biden
and
sanders
austin
healy
a
year-old
texan
who
voted
for
hillary
clinton
over
bernie
sanders
in
the
state's
primary
attended
an
early
september
campaign
rally
for
warren
in
austin
that
drew
thousands
he
told
nbc
news
that
he
liked
harris
in
the
beginning
but
followed
i
don't
really
know
what
she
stands
for
there's
not
really
a
clear
message
for
me
harris
an
oakland
native
who
first
served
as
san
francisco's
district
attorney
before
becoming
california's
attorney
general
has
also
struggled
to
change
perceptions
about
her
time
in
law
enforcement
it's
a
point
of
frustration
for
lateefah
simon
a
long-time
mentee
of
harris
who
said
she
was
yelling
at
the
tv
while
watching
the
third
debate
imploring
harris
to
tell
the
stories
that
define
her
record
as
a
progressive
prosecutor
simon
who
now
works
on
criminal
justice
reform
in
california
says
harris
needs
to
tell
it
raw
and
invoke
her
personal
experiences
simon
recalls
a
moment
when
harris
then
district
attorney
was
comforting
a
mother
whose
daughter
had
been
killed
when
the
victim's
mother
came
into
harris
office
sobbing
after
the
killer's
trial
harris
got
down
on
her
knees
with
her
i'm
here
with
you
look
at
me
i'm
here
with
you
harris
had
said
their
foreheads
touching
simon
recounted
i
have
watched
her
not
tell
these
stories
simon
recalls
why
don't
you
talk
about
claire
you
hired
me
why
don't
you
tell
that
story
deb
mesloh
a
longtime
harris
friend
and
campaign
adviser
told
nbc
news
that
she
has
learned
to
never
doubt
harris
because
she's
shown
resilience
in
tough
elections
for
her
district
attorney
and
attorney
general
posts
but
mesloh
acknowledged
the
scale
of
running
for
president
limits
the
opportunities
for
harris
to
make
personal
connections
with
voters
what
i'd
love
to
see
is
for
her
to
continue
to
share
her
personal
story
and
for
her
to
continue
to
talk
about
her
life
history
and
the
things
that
inform
her
leadership
and
connect
with
voters
in
a
one-on-one
sense
so
they
get
to
know
her
mesloh
said
sams
the
harris
campaign
spokesman
said
the
campaign
knows
it
is
working
against
candidates
namely
biden
sanders
and
warren
who
had
built-in
national
reputations
before
declaring
their
presidential
bids
voters
need
to
understand
who
you
are
they
need
to
understand
why
you're
running
sams
said
the
three
people
atop
the
polls
have
been
well
known
nationally
for
a
long
time
and
have
strong
brands
all
the
others
of
us
who
have
not
been
national
figures
before
have
to
do
even
more
to
tell
people
what
we're
about
and
get
it
to
stick
