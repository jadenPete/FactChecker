rep
steve
king
r-iowa
said
wednesday
that
during
a
recent
visit
to
a
migrant
detention
facility
he
drank
from
a
toilet
that
also
served
as
a
water
fountain
and
that
the
water
was
actually
pretty
good
i
actually
went
into
that
cell
where
it
was
reported
that
they
were
advised
they
had
to
drink
out
of
the
toilet
king
told
a
crowd
of
about
people
at
a
town
hall
in
eagle
grove
iowa
i
took
a
drink
out
of
there
and
actually
pretty
good
king's
story
was
in
reference
to
conditions
inside
immigration
detention
facilities
in
texas
that
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
as
well
as
members
of
the
congressional
hispanic
caucus
and
others
have
described
as
abysmal
in
july
following
a
visit
to
two
facilities
ocasio-cortez
said
she'd
learned
that
customs
and
border
patrol
officers
were
telling
detained
women
to
drink
out
of
the
toilet
toilets
that
also
serve
as
a
water
fountain
have
been
used
in
border
patrol
facilities
for
years
as
well
as
in
jails
around
the
u.s.
but
where
they
were
once
used
by
the
mostly
single
men
crossing
the
border
now
dozens
of
other
people
including
young
children
in
custody
are
being
forced
to
use
hybrid
device
meanwhile
king
who
has
a
long
history
of
inflammatory
statements
attempted
to
explain
how
the
devices
work
and
called
reports
of
people
having
to
drink
from
toilets
misinformation
that
was
a
result
of
detainees
not
being
able
to
speak
english
in
the
back
where
the
lid
would
be
on
our
toilet
that's
also
sealed
and
there's
a
water
fountain
there
you
push
the
button
the
water
comes
out
and
you
take
a
drink
it's
how
it
is
king
said
it's
not
drinking
out
of
the
toilet
it's
drinking
out
of
the
water
fountain
that's
integral
with
the
back
of
the
toilet
but
i
think
there
was
a
little
language
barrier
there
and
so
that's
how
come
we
got
that
misinformation
he
said
lawyers
immigrant
advocates
and
human
rights
activists
have
widely
decried
the
conditions
at
migrant
detention
facilities
as
inhumane
lawyers
who
recently
visited
two
texas
facilities
at
which
migrant
children
were
held
said
that
children
and
teens
had
not
been
able
to
shower
in
weeks
they
also
reported
an
inadequate
food
supply
and
flu
outbreaks
a
facility
meant
for
had
children
and
kids
as
young
as
or
were
forced
to
care
for
toddlers
