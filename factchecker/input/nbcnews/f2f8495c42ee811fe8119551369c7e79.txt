the
message
the
white
house
appears
to
have
inadvertently
sent
its
talking
points
on
president
donald
trump's
record
of
a
call
with
the
ukrainian
president
to
both
democratic
and
republican
offices
on
wednesday
the
email
was
sent
by
director
of
government
communications
tori
symonds
multiple
sources
told
nbc
news
then
in
a
separate
email
sent
shortly
after
and
obtained
by
nbc
news
symonds
sought
to
recall
the
message
symonds
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
among
the
talking
points
were
what
the
president
actually
talked
about
was
entirely
proper
the
real
scandal
here
is
that
leaks
about
a
second-hand
account
of
the
president's
confidential
telephone
call
with
a
foreign
leader
triggered
a
media
frenzy
of
false
accusations
against
the
president
and
forced
the
president
to
release
the
transcript
and
let's
be
clear
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
for
ukraine
to
get
us
aid
in
exchange
for
looking
into
biden
or
his
son
the
talking
points
were
sent
after
the
release
earlier
wednesday
of
a
summary
of
the
president's
late
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
which
blanketed
washington
this
week
scrutiny
of
the
call
led
to
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
announcement
tuesday
of
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
to
determine
whether
trump
sought
help
from
a
foreign
leader
to
boost
his
campaign
in
the
july
call
trump
asked
zelenskiy
if
he
could
do
a
favor
before
asking
him
to
further
probe
the
bidens
and
other
matters
involving
democrats
and
the
presidential
election
the
release
of
the
phone
call
came
after
intense
pressure
from
democrats
who
were
responding
to
reports
that
trump
pressured
zelenskiy
into
investigating
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
hunter
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
prosecution
so
if
you
can
look
into
it
it
sounds
horrible
to
me
trump
told
zelenskiy
during
the
minute
july
phone
call
according
to
the
call
log
which
the
white
house
noted
was
not
a
verbatim
transcript
i
heard
you
had
a
prosecutor
who
was
very
good
and
he
was
shut
down
and
that's
really
unfair
trump
says
on
the
call
according
to
the
description
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
that
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
zelenskiy
replied
that
he
planned
to
appoint
a
new
prosecutor
who
would
probe
the
matter
though
a
quid
pro
quo
was
not
explicit
trump
asks
for
the
favor
after
discussing
ukrainian
aid
with
zelenskiy
i
will
say
that
we
do
a
lot
for
ukraine
we
spend
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
time
much
more
than
the
european
countries
are
doing
trump
says
in
the
description
adding
the
u.s.
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
reciprocal
necessarily
because
things
are
happening
that
are
not
good
but
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
he
continued
trump
defended
the
conversation
on
wednesday
there
was
no
pressure
the
way
you
had
that
built
up
that
call
it
was
going
to
be
the
call
from
hell
trump
told
reporters
during
a
meeting
at
the
united
nations
after
the
summary
was
released
it
turned
out
to
be
a
nothing
call
other
than
a
lot
of
people
said
i
never
knew
you
could
be
so
nice
