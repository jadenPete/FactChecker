three
sources
familiar
with

is
major
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
an
inflection
point
one

said
another
described
it
as
a
big
shift
elaine
luria
of

in
the
washington

called

a
gamechanger
the
tide
is
changing
luria
told
rachel

on

luria

chrissy
houlahan
of
pennsylvania
mikie
sherrill
of
new
jersey
elissa
slotkin
of
michigan
and
abigail
spanberger
of
virginia
said
their
experiences
in
the
military
defense
and
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
helped
shape
their
decision
we
have
devoted
our
lives
to
the
service
and
security
of
our
country
and
throughout
our
careers
we
have
sworn
oaths
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
many
times
over
now
we
join
as
a
unified
group
to
uphold
that
oath
as
we
enter
uncharted
waters
and
face
unprecedented
allegations
against
president
trump
they
wrote
they
urged
pelosi
to
start
proceedings
to
examine
whether
the
president
used
his
position
to
pressure
a
foreign
county
into
investigating
a
political
opponent
and
if
he
sought
to
use
u.s.
taxpayer
dollars
as
leverage
to
do
it
trump
has
been
accused
of
threatening
to
cut
off
funding
for
ukraine
in
order
to
get
prosecutors
there
to
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
energy
company
on
monday
the
president
said
he
had
tied
funding
for
ukraine
to
the
way
that
nation
handles
corruption
which
he
has
alleged
biden's
family
was
engaged
in
there
before
denying
just
hours
later
he'd
made
any
such
demand
senior
administration
officials
told
the
washington
post
on
monday
that
in
the
days
before
a
phone
call
in
which
he
urged
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
look
into
biden's
son
trump
instructed
his
chief
of
staff
to
place
a
hold
on
close
to
million
in
military
aid
for
the
country
the
phone
call
is
said
to
have
happened
july
and
the
funds
were
released
earlier
this
month
the
post
reported
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
on
monday
night
denied
those
allegations
the
media
pushed
the
russia
lie
for
almost
three
years
with
no
evidence
and
now
they
are
doing
it
all
over
again
he
told
nbc
news
these
allegations
are
completely
false
but
because
the
media
wants
this
story
to
be
true
so
badly
they'll
once
again
manufacture
a
frenzy
and
drive
ignorant
fake
stories
to
attack
this
president
for
months
pelosi
has
tried
to
keep
talk
of
impeaching
trump
at
bay
dismissing
it
as
too
divisive
but
pelosi
is
now
asking
colleagues
whether
they
believe
trump's
own
admission
that
he
pressured
his
ukrainian
counterpart
to
investigate
biden
is
a
tipping
point
according
to
multiple
democratic
aides
as
first
reported
by
the
washington
post
pelosi's
office
is
refusing
to
comment
on
the
record
pelosi
and
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
on
monday
spoke
by
phone
today
about
the
trump
whistleblower
complaint
and
impeachment
on
sunday
in
a
letter
to
colleagues
pelosi
threatened
a
new
stage
of
investigation
if
the
trump
administration
and
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
fail
to
provide
a
whistleblower
complaint
centered
on
ukraine
when
maguire
testifies
in
front
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
maguire
and
inspector
general
atkinson
are
also
set
to
appear
before
the
senate
intelligence
committee
behind
closed
doors
thursday
afternoon
after
appearing
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
pelosi
has
called
an
all-caucus
meeting
for
p
m
tuesday
that
is
expected
to
cover
impeachment
but
no
decisions
on
how
to
proceed
have
been
made
according
to
a
senior
democratic
aide
the
idea
of
creating
a
select
panel
which
would
be
made
of
relevant
committee
chairs
to
investigate
trump
and
his
attempts
to
strongarm
ukraine
into
investigating
biden
and
his
son
is
among
the
options
the
aide
said
and
though
the
speaker
has
not
officially
blessed
anything
in
the
event
a
select
panel
is
needed
the
chairs
would
issue
a
report
to
the
judiciary
committee
which
would
handle
any
impeachment
referral
some
members
are
expected
to
publicly
endorse
this
idea
on
tuesday
according
to
the
senior
democratic
leadership
aide
the
democrats
who
wrote
the
opinion
editorial
in
the
washington
post
had
discussed
the
potential
collaboration
for
months
as
frustration
mounted
with
the
judiciary
committee
proceedings
and
how
nadler
has
handled
them
their
calls
for
impeachment
proceedings
were
echoed
by
two
other
democrats
who
had
not
previously
made
their
positions
known
on
monday
night
rep
veronica
escobar
of
texas
called
for
trump's
impeachment
as
did
rep
debbie
dingell
of
michigan
as
of
monday
night
house
democrats
had
expressed
support
for
some
type
of
action
regarding
impeachment
some
have
called
for
an
inquiry
or
hearings
while
others
have
gone
further
and
support
drafting
articles
of
impeachment
