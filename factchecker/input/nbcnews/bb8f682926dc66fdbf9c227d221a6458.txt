share
this
this
north
carolina
house
race
will
show
if
trump's
coalition
is
falling
apart
the
special
election
takes
place
tuesday
in
a
district
that
the
president
won
by
double
digits
in
the
last
time
a
president
was
denied
a
second
term
the
omen
came
a
full
year
before
election
day
it
was
back
in
november
when
the
supposedly
unbeatable
republican
candidate
richard
thornburgh
was
crushed
in
a
special
election
for
the
senate
a
few
days
later
thornburgh
went
to
george
h.w.
bush's
white
house
with
a
warning
boys
i'm
your
canary
and
there's
trouble
in
the
mine
enfeebled
politically
by
a
worsening
economy
bush
would
end
up
losing
both
pennsylvania
and
the
presidency
in
the
election
since
then
there
have
been
four
presidents
and
three
of
them
bill
clinton
george
w.
bush
and
barack
obama
were
able
to
win
re-election
president
donald
trump
is
the
fourth
his
fate
to
be
determined
by
the
voters
a
little
over
a
year
from
now
but
like
with
bush
a
potential
omen
looms
this
time
in
a
charlotte-area
congressional
district
at
stake
tuesday
night
north
carolina's
th
district
went
for
trump
by
points
in
the
election
to
percent
but
in
last
year's
midterm
elections
the
democratic
candidate
dan
mccready
battled
republican
mark
harris
who
had
ousted
incumbent
rep
robert
pittenger
in
the
gop
primary
to
a
near-draw
and
when
subsequent
revelations
of
absentee
ballot
fraud
on
harris
behalf
invalidated
the
election
a
new
race
was
scheduled
mccready
is
once
again
running
as
the
democratic
nominee
this
time
against
dan
bishop
a
republican
state
senator
the
limited
polling
that's
been
conducted
suggests
a
close
contest
and
anxiety
is
high
enough
among
republicans
that
trump
held
a
rally
on
bishop's
behalf
nearby
on
the
eve
of
the
tuesday
special
election
the
white
house
obviously
will
be
satisfied
with
any
kind
of
victory
for
bishop
even
if
it's
a
close
one
in
addition
in
the
wake
of
the
ballot
fraud
drama
and
after
years
of
local
republican
infighting
trump
and
his
allies
will
have
some
mitigating
factors
to
point
to
if
their
candidate's
performance
is
shaky
but
it's
also
possible
mccready
will
actually
win
this
race
and
if
he
does
it
will
invite
comparisons
to
that
fateful
upset
in
pennsylvania
years
ago
the
circumstances
back
then
were
much
different
than
they
are
now
bush
had
in
early
led
america
to
a
shockingly
efficient
victory
in
the
gulf
war
in
the
aftermath
of
that
triumph
his
approval
rating
climbed
past
percent
and
he
was
pronounced
invulnerable
in
but
the
economy
was
stalling
and
unemployment
was
rising
by
the
fall
of
bush's
approval
wasn't
far
above
percent
and
there
was
talk
that
just
maybe
he'd
be
in
for
a
real
fight
for
re-election
in
that
context
the
pennsylvania
special
election
was
clarifying
thornburgh
was
a
member
of
bush's
cabinet
serving
as
his
attorney
general
and
he
was
broadly
popular
in
the
state
after
two
terms
as
governor
his
opponent
democrat
harris
wofford
a
jfk-era
civil
rights
veteran
and
former
college
president
was
well-regarded
in
elite
circles
but
little-known
statewide
it
looked
like
a
gigantic
mismatch
and
initial
polls
confirmed
that
wofford
was
far
behind
wofford
built
his
campaign
on
criticism
of
bush's
economic
record
and
a
populist
pitch
for
universal
healthcare
steadily
he
gained
ground
ultimately
beating
thornburgh
by
points
to
the
political
world
it
was
dramatic
confirmation
of
a
suspicion
that
had
been
building
for
a
while
bush
really
was
in
trouble
in
and
bill
clinton
proved
it
trump's
political
standing
by
contrast
has
been
far
steadier
than
bush's
his
approval
rating
has
hovered
somewhere
between
the
high
s
and
the
mid
s
for
his
entire
presidency
his
disapproval
number
is
generally
above
percent
it's
been
clear
all
along
that
trump
will
be
vulnerable
in
any
re-election
campaign
but
just
how
vulnerable
after
all
as
a
candidate
in
trump's
poll
numbers
also
looked
atrocious
and
yet
he
still
found
a
narrow
path
to
victory
in
that
sense
the
special
election
in
north
carolina's
th
district
on
tuesday
could
also
be
clarifying
to
win
again
next
year
trump
can
ill-afford
any
slack
in
the
coalition
he
assembled
in
if
republicans
can't
hang
on
in
a
district
he
carried
by
double-digits
it
will
be
an
unmistakable
sign
that
there's
trouble
in
the
mine
