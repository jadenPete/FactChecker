this
there's
no
evidence
for
trump's
biden-ukraine
accusations
what
really
happened
trump's
claims
appear
to
be
at
the
center
of
a
scandal
involving
a
phone
call
with
ukraine's
president
in
which
trump
reportedly
pressed
for
a
probe
of
his
political
rival
president
donald
trump
says
he
discussed
political
rival
joe
biden
with
the
president
of
ukraine
a
phone
call
reportedly
at
the
heart
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
has
led
to
the
launch
of
formal
impeachment
proceedings
in
the
house
for
one
reason
a
desire
to
root
out
corruption
the
former
vice
president
trump
said
wielded
his
influence
to
benefit
his
son
hunter's
private-sector
work
in
ukraine
but
despite
trump's
continued
claims
there's
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
either
biden
what
joe
biden
did
for
his
son
that's
something
they
should
be
looking
at
trump
told
reporters
tuesday
deflecting
questions
about
the
renewed
push
by
house
democrats
for
impeachment
proceedings
in
the
wake
of
the
revelations
surrounding
his
dealings
with
ukraine
which
include
reports
that
he
pressured
ukraine's
leader
to
probe
biden
and
his
family
while
that
country
was
awaiting
u.s.
aid
he'd
delayed
here's
what
we
know
about
biden's
actions
as
vice
president
with
regard
to
ukraine
trump's
accusations
and
the
phone
call
and
trump's
own
dealings

the

biden
lead
the
u.s.
diplomatic
efforts
to
bolster
the
country's
fledgling
democracy
and
root
out
corruption
after
mass
protests
ousted
the
country's
pro-russia
president
viktor
yanukovych
biden
spoke
frequently
with
ukrainian
leaders
and
in
april
he
traveled
to
ukraine
bringing
financial
support
and
warning
the
russians
who
had
recently
annexed
crimea
to
stop
intervening
in
ukrainian
sovereignty
in
may
hunter
biden
was
hired
by
a
ukrainian
gas
company
burisma
holdings
as
a
board
member
reportedly
making
a
month
he
stopped
working
with
the
company
earlier
this
year
the
company
had
ties
to
yanukovych
raising
eyebrows
among
white
house
aides
and
others
who
saw
potential
for
a
conflict
of
interest
the
obama
white
house
said
at
the
time
that
the
younger
biden
was
a
private
citizen
and
that
there
was
no
conflict
of
interest
trump
whose
july
phone
conversation
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
was
reportedly
so
unusual
it
triggered
a
whistleblower
complaint
said
sunday
ahead
of
his
departure
for
an
event
in
texas
that
he
discussed
with
the
ukrainian
leader
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine
nbc
news
has
not
confirmed
that
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
the
whistleblower
issue
trump
reiterated
this
version
of
events
to
reporters
once
he
arrived
in
houston
he
said
i'm
not
going
to
give
billions
of
dollars
to
ukraine
unless
they
remove
this
prosecutor
and
they
removed
the
prosecutor
supposedly
in
one
hour
trump
claimed
referring
to
biden
and
the
prosecutor
was
prosecuting
the
company
of
the
son
and
the
son
he
just
shouldn't
have
said
that
now
as
far
as
my
conversation
it
was
perfect
it
was
a
perfect
conversation
on
monday
he
reiterated
this
claim
it
was
a
perfect
call
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
unlike
biden
trump
said
but
the
revelation
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
from
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
committee
first
reported
in
the
washington
post
reportedly
involving
the
call
came
after
a
monthslong
effort
by
the
president's
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
to
get
ukraine
to
probe
the
bidens
an
effort
aided
by
the
state
department
both
trump
and
giuliani
have
alleged
that
biden
used
the
prospect
of
u.s.
financial
support
to
pressure
the
ukrainian
government
to
fire
its
top
prosecutor
in
because
the
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
was
investigating
the
gas
company
burisma
and
allegedly
hunter
shokin
was
widely
believed
to
be
soft
on
corruption
however
and
the
united
states
and
other
western
countries
had
called
for
his
removal
the
country's
parliament
ultimately
voted
to
remove
shokin
biden
has
taken
credit
for
getting
the
prosecutor
removed
boasting
about
it
as
a
win
for
anticorruption
in
the
country
but
there's
little
evidence
he
acted
to
help
his
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
and
politifact
reported
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
additionally
the
most
recent
former
prosecutor
general
of
ukraine
yuriy
lutsenko
told
bloomberg
he
had
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
either
biden
other
investigations
into
burisma's
oligarch
owner
mykola
zlochevsky
proceeded
and
the
new
york
times
reported
sunday
that
former
associates
of
the
vice
president
have
said
biden
did
not
try
to
stop
them
a
week
before
the
president's
phone
call
with
the
ukrainian
leader
trump
instructed
his
acting
chief
of
staff
to
freeze
about
million
in
security
and
military
aid
two
administration
officials
told
nbc
news
this
timeline
was
first
reported
by
the
washington
post
the
administration
official
who
directed
the
state
department
to
withhold
the
aid
to
ukraine
was
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
according
to
a
senior
democratic
aide
who
was
briefed
by
the
state
department
last
week
according
to
a
memo
summarizing
the
call
released
by
the
white
house
trump
stressed
how
good
the
united
states
had
been
to
ukraine
i
will
say
that
we
do
a
lot
for
ukraine
we
spend
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
time
much
more
than
the
european
countries
are
doing
and
they
should
be
helping
you
more
than
they
are
trump
said
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
reciprocal
necessarily
because
things
are
happening
that
are
not
good
but
the
united
states
has
been
very
very
good
to
ukraine
then
he
asks
zelenskiy
to
look
into
the
bidens
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
biden's
son
what
biden
stopped
the
prosecution
and
a
lot
of
people
want
to
find
out
about
that
so
whatever
you
can
do
with
the
attorney
general
would
be
great
biden
went
around
bragging
that
he
stopped
the
prosecution
so
if
you
can
look
into
it
it
sounds
horrible
to
me
trump
said
according
to
the
the
white
house
notes
of
the
call
trump
also
says
he
wants
zelenskiy
to
meet
with
giuliani
and
noted
that
he
heard
the
prosecutor
was
treated
very
bad
and
he
was
a
very
fair
prosecutor
according
to
the
memo
in
fact
shokin
the
prosecutor
in
question
was
widely
believed
to
be
corrupt
and
bloomberg
news
has
reported
that
his
investigation
into
burisma
was
dormant
by
the
time
biden
called
for
his
resignation
pressed
tuesday
about
the
call
prior
to
the
public
release
of
the
summary
trump
said
he
did
it
in
protest
of
other
countries
actions
my
complaint
has
always
been
and
i'd
withhold
again
and
i'll
continue
to
withhold
until
such
time
as
europe
and
other
nations
contribute
to
ukraine
because
they're
not
doing
it
it's
the
united
states
we're
putting
up
the
bulk
of
the
money
and
i'm
asking
why
is
that
trump
said
referring
to
the
international
aid
that's
been
sent
to
bolster
ukraine
and
its
fledgling
democracy
against
russian
aggression
this
is
not
true
the
european
union
put
up
billion
in
financial
aid
according
to
a
fact
sheet
from
the
e.u.
s
diplomatic
arm
the
international
monetary
fund
said
it
would
put
forward
at
least
billion
in
a
bailout
as
well
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
biden
said
this
weekend
telling
reporters
that
trump
had
abused
his
power
and
violated
the
constitution
biden
also
said
he's
never
spoken
to
my
son
about
his
overseas
business
dealings
still
in
a
july
profile
in
the
new
yorker
hunter
biden
recalled
a
brief
conversation
with
his
father
about
his
work
in
ukraine
as
hunter
recalled
his
father
discussed
burisma
with
him
just
once
dad
said
i
hope
you
know
what
you
are
doing
and
i
said
i
do
biden
said
tuesday
he'd
support
impeachment
if
the
president
didn't
cooperate
with
congressional
oversight
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
democrats
had
decried
the
administration
for
failing
to
provide
the
complaint
to
congress
after
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
deemed
the
matter
an
urgent
concern
that
he
was
required
by
law
to
turn
over
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
if
the
president
does
not
comply
with
such
a
request
from
the
congress
if
he
continues
to
obstruct
congress
and
flout
the
law
donald
trump
will
leave
congress
in
my
view
no
choice
but
to
initiate
impeachment
that
would
be
a
tragedy
but
a
tragedy
of
his
own
making
biden
said
hours
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
announced
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
tuesday
evening
the
trump
administration
reversed
course
on
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
white
house
is
now
preparing
to
turn
over
the
complaint
to
congress
by
thursday
according
to
a
senior
administration
official
that
official
tells
nbc
news
the
complaint
will
first
undergo
a
classification
review
