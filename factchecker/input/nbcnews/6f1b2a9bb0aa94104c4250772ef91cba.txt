pompeo
defends
plan
to
host
taliban
leaders
at
camp
david
president
trump
ultimately
made
the
decision
pompeo
said
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
president
ghani
i
want
to
talk
to
these
taliban
negotiators
hours
after
president
donald
trump
called
off
a
secret
meeting
between
the
u.s.
afghan
leaders
and
the
taliban
at
camp
david
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
on
sunday
defended
the
decision
to
invite
taliban
leaders
to
the
u.s.
in
the
first
place
during
an
interview
with
nbc's
meet
the
press
host
chuck
todd
pressed
pompeo
on
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
have
the
taliban
set
foot
on
camp
david
given
the
area's
historical
significance
pompeo
responded
by
saying
that
while
there
were
lots
of
discussions
about
the
issue
the
president
ultimately
made
the
decision
that
if
we
could
get
that
if
we
could
get
commitments
and
then
put
in
place
a
verification
regime
that
would
give
us
confidence
that
we
could
observe
that
those
commitments
were
being
honored
that
it
was
a
useful
effort
to
try
and
get
all
of
those
parties
in
one
place
so
that
we
could
have
serious
conversations
about
how
to
reduce
america's
risk
so
that
there
won't
be
other
secretaries
of
state
that
have
to
travel
to
dover
to
go
see
these
amazing
american
heroes
who
have
given
so
much
for
our
country
pompeo
made
similar
comments
on
fox
news
sunday
telling
host
chris
wallace
that
president
trump
ultimately
made
the
decision
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
i
want
to
talk
to
these
taliban
negotiators
i
want
to
look
them
in
the
eye
i
want
to
see
if
we
can
get
to
the
final
outcome
that
we
needed
so
we
could
sign
off
on
the
deal
so
we
found
that
arrangement
acceptable
and
we
concluded
this
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
place
he
added
you
know
the
history
of
camp
david
lots
of
bad
folks
have
come
through
that
place
pompeo
spoke
with
all
five
of
the
major
sunday
political
talk
shows
in
interviews
that
were
set
to
take
place
prior
to
trump's
announcement
the
idea
of
hosting
taliban
leaders
had
come
under
fire
from
both
democrats
and
republicans
rep
liz
cheney
r-wyo
tweeted
that
no
member
of
the
taliban
should
set
foot
at
camp
david
ever
rep
adam
kinzinger
r-ill
tweeted
never
should
leaders
of
a
terrorist
organization
that
hasn't
renounced
and
continues
in
evil
be
allowed
in
our
great
country
never
full
stop
and
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
asked
what
the
point
was
of
dragging
ghani
and
taliban
leaders
all
the
way
to
camp
david
how
on
earth
would
legitimacy
of
a
deal
in
afghanistan
been
enhanced
by
it
being
signed
in
america
rather
than
afghanistan
he
tweeted
late
saturday
trump
tweeted
he
was
calling
off
the
planned
peace
negotiations
after
a
u.s.
service
member
was
killed
in
a
suicide
attack
in
kabul
afghanistan
the
president
said
he
planned
to
meet
secretly
with
taliban
leadership
and
separately
ghani
at
camp
david
on
sunday
as
the
sides
looked
to
reach
a
deal
on
how
to
end
the
years
of
conflict
in
the
country
unbeknownst
to
almost
everyone
the
major
taliban
leaders
and
separately
the
president
of
afghanistan
were
going
to
secretly
meet
with
me
at
camp
david
on
sunday
trump
tweeted
they
were
coming
to
the
united
states
tonight
unfortunately
in
order
to
build
false
leverage
they
admitted
to
an
attack
in
kabul
that
killed
one
of
our
great
great
soldiers
and
other
people
i
immediately
cancelled
the
meeting
and
called
off
peace
negotiations
he
added
what
kind
of
people
would
kill
so
many
in
order
to
seemingly
strengthen
their
bargaining
position
they
didn't
they
only
made
it
worse
if
they
cannot
agree
to
a
ceasefire
during
these
very
important
peace
talks
and
would
even
kill
innocent
people
then
they
probably
don't
have
the
power
to
negotiate
a
meaningful
agreement
anyway
how
many
more
decades
are
they
willing
to
fight
for
months
the
u.s.
has
been
working
toward
a
deal
that
would
allow
the
country
to
pull
troops
out
of
afghanistan
where
the
u.s.
has
been
fighting
its
longest
war
the
attack
trump
cited
was
one
of
multiple
that
the
taliban
has
carried
out
in
the
past
week
the
taliban
controls
or
heavily
influences
roughly
half
of
afghanistan
over
the
past
week
the
trump
administration
has
signaled
an
agreement
was
imminent
but
talks
between
the
u.s.
and
taliban
had
recently
hit
a
snag
and
the
afghan
government
was
displeased
with
not
being
invited
to
take
part
in
the
discussions
about
u.s.
troops
remain
in
afghanistan
where
roughly
americans
have
been
killed
since
the
onset
of
war
nearly
years
ago
the
u.s.
was
negotiating
with
the
taliban
to
withdraw
troops
initially
on
sunday
the
new
york
times
reported
that
the
meetings
was
called
off
because
negotiators
hit
a
wall
over
how
the
deal
should
be
finalized
and
announced
cnn
reported
that
the
administration
is
working
toward
rescheduling
the
meeting
speaking
with
cnn's
state
of
the
union
pompeo
said
real
progress
was
made
toward
a
deal
with
the
taliban
adding
however
that
the
administration
would
not
enter
into
any
deal
if
conditions
on
the
ground
weren't
appropriate
it
was
the
case
that
when
the
taliban
tried
to
gain
a
negotiating
advantage
by
conducting
terror
attacks
inside
the
country
president
trump
made
the
right
decision
to
cancel
the
meeting
pompeo
said
it
made
no
sense
for
the
taliban
to
be
rewarded
for
that
kind
of
bad
behavior
presidential
candidates
used
the
uncertainty
of
the
talks
to
call
out
the
president's
foreign
policy
strategy
to
me
this
is
just
no
way
to
conduct
foreign
policy
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
told
cnn's
state
of
the
union
on
sunday
this
isn't
a
game
show
these
are
terrorists
the
way
he
conducts
foreign
policy
this
reminds
me
exactly
of
north
korea
he
loves
the
showmanship
he
wants
to
have
that
moment
but
then
all
the
details
aren't
done
and
then
we
end
up
in
a
worse
place
on
the
world
stage
than
we
were
before
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
himself
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
said
the
ended
camp
david
peace
talks
were
another
bizarre
episode
for
the
administration
it's
more
of
his
erratic
behavior
that
people
are
tired
of
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
believe
that
he's
going
to
lose
in
castro
