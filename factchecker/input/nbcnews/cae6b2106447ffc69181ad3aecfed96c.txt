share
this
democratic
freshmen
holdouts
on
impeachment
face
rising
pressure
for
many
lawmakers
this
august
recess
there
was
no
dodging
the
issue
on
the
home
front
whether
their
districts
were
solidly
blue
or
more
closely
divided
miami
inside
a
packed
town
hall
meeting
late
last
month
in
a
democratic
district
the
first
three
out
of
four
questions
that
constituents
peppered
freshman
rep
donna
shalala
with
focused
on
just
one
issue
why
she
is
among
the
house
democrats
who
have
not
publicly
and
explicitly
backed
an
impeachment
inquiry
do
you
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
now
into
the
president's
activities
asked
one
man
in
miami's
city
hall
surrounded
by
palm
trees
along
the
shore
of
biscayne
bay
that's
precisely
what
we're
doing
now
shalala
responded
speaking
to
an
audience
of
about
people
the
judiciary
committee
is
doing
an
impeachment
inquiry
voters
at
the
town
hall
appeared
less
satisfied
with
her
careful
time
frame
than
shalala
was
and
they
returned
again
and
again
to
the
original
query
the
dwindling
number
of
democratic
lawmakers
who
haven't
taken
a
position
on
whether
they
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
president
donald
trump
used
to
have
a
ready
explanation
they
weren't
answering
the
question
they
said
because
their
constituents
back
home
weren't
asking
but
for
many
democratic
members
this
august
recess
there
was
no
dodging
the
issue
on
the
homefront
whether
their
districts
were
solidly
blue
or
more
closely
divided
at
a
town
hall
back
in
her
home
district
in
the
western
suburbs
of
chicago
rep
lauren
underwood
came
out
for
impeachment
rep
brad
schneider
also
of
illinois
did
the
same
just
hours
before
his
own
public
meeting
with
voters
rep
conor
lamb
of
pennsylvania
who
won
the
fierce
fight
for
his
formerly
red
seat
last
year
didn't
but
was
repeatedly
pressed
on
the
question
at
the
constituent
session
in
his
district
so
was
shalala
we
need
to
make
a
clear
narrative
and
then
judiciary
will
make
a
recommendation
to
the
house
of
representatives
to
our
caucus
on
whether
we
will
start
the
articles
of
impeachment
she
said
at
last
month's
town
hall
calling
the
president
a
racist
and
a
sexist
let
me
make
this
clear
there
is
no
one
in
this
room
that
wants
president
trump
to
go
away
more
than
me
said
shalala
who
was
elected
last
november
to
the
seat
held
for
years
by
retired
gop
rep
ileana
ros-lehtinen
shalala
echoed
the
argument
made
by
speaker
nancy
pelosi
of
california
that
democrats
are
gathering
information
and
methodically
going
through
the
process
by
issuing
subpoenas
for
documents
and
testimony
from
key
witnesses
now
that
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
has
said
that
he's
initiated
an
investigation
somehow
linked
to
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
democrats
in
congress
say
they
don't
have
to
explicitly
endorse
it
on
the
other
hand
many
constituents
including
several
at
shalala's
town
hall
seem
to
want
to
hear
their
representatives
do
just
that
especially
now
that
a
majority
of
the
democratic
caucus
has
taken
that
position
publicly
polls
including
a
monmouth
university
survey
released
the
week
before
shalala's
town
hall
have
suggested
that
around
in
democrats
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
well
under
half
the
independent
voters
surveyed
agreed
the
number
for
republicans
lies
in
the
single
digits
so
far
more
than
half
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
out
of
have
publicly
backed
an
impeachment
inquiry
with
the
pace
quickening
in
the
wake
of
the
release
of
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
this
spring
of
that
group
are
freshmen
of
whom
flipped
seats
last
november
that
had
previously
been
held
by
republicans
after
most
lawmakers
left
washington
for
the
six-week
august
recess
nadler
and
members
of
the
judiciary
committee
insisted
that
his
panel
has
already
in
effect
been
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
of
the
president
and
announced
in
a
court
filing
made
that
day
that
articles
of
impeachment
are
under
consideration
as
part
of
the
committee's
investigation
although
no
final
determination
has
been
made
that
committee
of
which
shalala
is
not
a
member
is
on
track
to
take
a
formal
vote
this
week
when
lawmakers
return
to
capitol
hill
after
their
monthlong
recess
to
set
the
impeachment
probe's
parameters
the
vote
expected
wednesday
and
confirmed
to
nbc
news
by
a
source
familiar
with
the
committee's
plans
will
include
language
that
is
expected
to
follow
the
procedures
the
judiciary
committee
used
in
during
the
nixon
impeachment
proceedings
shalala
is
among
the
freshman
democrats
who
have
not
publicly
favored
an
impeachment
inquiry
nearly
all
of
them
including
shalala
flipped
their
seats
in
last
year's
midterm
elections
cook
political
report
has
rated
of
their
races
as
toss-ups
next
year
ira
rubin
a
registered
democrat
pressed
shalala
further
at
her
town
hall
about
why
she
hasn't
explicitly
supported
an
impeachment
inquiry
imploring
her
to
explain
what
was
stopping
her
from
joining
more
than
half
of
her
caucus
it's
not
a
hard
call
to
say
do
you
support
impeachment
proceedings
it
may
be
a
harder
call
to
vote
for
impeachment
rubin
told
nbc
news
before
the
town
hall
that
position
wasn't
universal
among
those
present
i'm
ambivalent
about
it
said
charity
johnson
a
year-old
democrat
i
think
that
it
could
backfire
i
don't
doubt
that
there's
just
cause
for
it
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
going
to
accomplish
what
the
democrats
want
and
those
who
all
want
to
get
the
current
president
out
of
office
shalala
who
served
as
president
bill
clinton's
health
and
human
services
secretary
during
his
two
terms
and
the
clinton
impeachment
process
told
nbc
after
the
event
that
in
her
view
an
impeachment
inquiry
is
just
a
semantic
term
if
nadler
believes
there's
enough
evidence
to
justify
filing
articles
of
impeachment
she
said
he
will
make
that
recommendation
that
didn't
mean
she
would
necessarily
agree
with
it
asked
if
she
would
go
along
with
nadler's
recommendation
outright
she
demurred
nadler
is
pretty
careful
she
said
but
i
would
not
commit
myself
right
now
but
if
that's
the
recommendation
to
the
house
my
guess
is
the
votes
may
be
there
it
wasn't
clear
if
she
was
including
her
own
the
impeachment
query
actually
comes
accompanied
by
a
series
of
thorny
related
political
questions
for
freshman
democrats
whether
they
might
lose
re-election
if
they
back
an
impeachment
inquiry
or
will
be
primaried
by
another
democrat
if
they
don't
whether
a
vote
in
favor
of
articles
of
impeachment
could
cost
them
their
seat
or
thanks
to
base
passion
power
them
to
another
term
and
perhaps
the
biggest
question
of
all
one
republicans
have
raised
time
and
again
whether
any
house
vote
on
the
issue
risks
the
democratic
majority
still
some
freshman
democrats
facing
tough
re-election
fights
such
as
underwood
and
rep
katie
porter
of
california
have
made
their
bet
this
summer
on
backing
the
impeachment
inquiry
constituents
pressing
lawmakers
on
impeachment
last
month
weren't
alone
over
the
summer
a
coalition
of
progressive
advocacy
groups
including
indivisible
and
tom
steyer's
need
to
impeach
launched
impeachment
august
an
online
resource
that
tracked
where
members
of
congress
were
holding
public
events
urging
supporters
to
show
up
and
lobby
lawmakers
to
back
impeachment
the
groups
said
in
late
august
that
at
least
house
democrats
two
of
whom
are
freshmen
members
have
come
out
in
favor
of
the
inquiry
since
they
launched
the
effort
laurie
woodward-garcia
who
leads
broward
for
progress
a
florida
offshoot
of
indivisible
attended
shalala's
town
hall
afterward
she
held
a
large
orange
sign
outside
city
hall
that
read
impeachment
inquiry
now
she
told
nbc
news
that
she
and
a
handful
of
her
members
visited
all
of
the
congressional
offices
in
south
florida
over
the
previous
three
weeks
meeting
with
lawmakers
staffs
and
calling
on
the
members
to
back
an
impeachment
inquiry
i
said
i
promise
you
that
if
we
don't
hear
back
from
said
member
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
before
they
go
back
to
washington
i
will
return
with
more
people
and
we
will
start
to
get
louder
she
said
that's
what
i
consider
the
first
step
if
you
will
just
alerting
them
that
we're
watching
these
groups
are
focused
not
only
on
rank-and-file
members
they
want
to
influence
democratic
leaders
too
in
coordination
with
far-left
group
credo
action
free
speech
for
people
helped
promote
a
protest
last
month
outside
of
a
san
francisco
fundraiser
where
pelosi
was
being
honored
we're
focusing
pressure
on
speaker
pelosi
herself
who's
been
resistant
to
the
notion
that
the
house
should
proceed
in
this
way
said
free
speech
for
people
president
john
bonifaz
even
as
these
calls
for
impeachment
grow
louder
in
some
swing
districts
some
democratic
members
in
other
areas
of
the
country
remain
dead
set
against
it
at
least
for
now
i
don't
support
impeachment
freshman
rep
anthony
brindisi
of
new
york
said
by
phone
and
i
think
by
and
large
the
appetite
for
impeachment
is
not
there
by
the
american
people
and
by
the
people
in
the
district
that
i
represent
his
central
new
york
constituents
he
said
want
lawmakers
to
focus
instead
on
improving
the
lives
of
everyday
americans
i
don't
want
to
see
us
get
bogged
down
in
investigations
because
one
thing
i've
learned
over
my
time
in
washington
so
far
is
it's
very
easy
for
congress
to
get
sidetracked
on
issues
when
i
think
we
should
be
focused
on
health
care
and
other
important
issues
that
got
folks
like
myself
into
office
he
added
but
like
many
of
his
fellow
freshmen
holdouts
he
wouldn't
rule
anything
out
obviously
if
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
criminal
activity
by
the
president
that's
a
conversation
we
have
to
have
