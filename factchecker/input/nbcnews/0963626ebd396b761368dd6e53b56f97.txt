five
questions
to
ask
when
analyzing
political
polls
not

polls
are
created
equally
so
here
are
five
key
questions
to
ask
when
reading
them
washington
not
all
political
polls
are
created
equally
and
different
surveys
sometimes
show
different
results
as
the
presidential
race
kicks
into
another
gear
and
with
hundreds
of
different
polls
expected
to
be
released
between
now
and
election
day
here's
some
helpful
guidance
when
examining
the
horserace
numbers
was
it
a
reputable
news
organization
or
a
pollster
with
past
experience
measuring
public
opinion
in
political
races
or
none
of
the
above
the
nbc
news
wall
street
journal
poll
for
example
is
conducted
jointly
by
two
polling
outfits
the
democratic
firm
hart
research
associates
and
the
republican
firm
public
opinion
strategies
both
of
which
have
a
long
history
polling
for
political
candidates
and
parties
in
august
a
monmouth
university
poll
found
joe
biden
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
in
a
three-way
tie
for
first
place
in
the
democratic
horserace
contrary
to
other
polling
showing
biden
with
a
significant
lead
over
his
democratic
competitors
days
later
however
additional
polls
contradicted
the
monmouth
finding
all
showing
biden
with
a
double-digit
advantage
i
t
is
clear
that
the
monmouth
university
poll
published
monday
aug
is
an
outlier
said
patrick
murray
the
monmouth
poll's
director
this
is
a
product
of
the
uncertainty
that
is
inherent
in
the
polling
process
still
the
polling
averages
and
conventional
wisdom
aren't
always
right
in
for
instance
the
averages
had
hillary
clinton
narrowly
leading
donald
trump
in
the
crucial
battleground
states
of
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
trump
ended
up
winning
all
three
states
as
the
election
also
taught
us
the
national
popular
vote
doesn't
decide
the
presidency
the
electoral
college
does
and
so
while
clinton
won
the
popular
vote
by
more
than
percentage
points
confirming
the
national
polls
that
showed
her
ahead
trump
won
the
electoral
college
by
carrying
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
the
same
is
also
true
for
the
presidential-nomination
race
the
national
popular
vote
doesn't
decide
who
will
face
trump
in
november
instead
the
results
and
delegates
awarded
from
individual
state
contests
do
some
polls
show
different
results
because
they
were
conducted
during
different
timespans
and
thus
different
events
and
news
cycles
polls
also
have
different
samples
and
sample
sizes
was
it
conducted
among
adults
a
thousand
registered
voters
five-hundred
likely
voters
those
modeled
as
most
likely
to
vote
in
an
election
and
the
smaller
the
sample
size
the
larger
the
margin
of
error
also
note
that
a
margin
of
error
in
a
horserace
goes
in
both
directions
so
a
poll's
margin
of
error
of
plus-minus
percentage
points
would
require
a
candidate's
lead
to
be
greater
than
points
to
be
considered
outside
the
margin
of
error
maybe
the
biggest
difference
among
polls
is
how
they're
conducted
are
the
questioners
live
human
beings
which
nbc
news
prefers
or
are
they
automated
voices
a
methodological
no-no
for
nbc
respondents
also
are
reached
by
different
methods
landline
phone
cellphone
or
online
gold-standard
polls
like
the
nbc
wsj
survey
are
live-caller
polls
with
a
large
number
of
cellphone
interviews
