u.s.
security
agencies
are
working
closely
with
the
presidential
campaigns
to
safeguard
against
foreign
attacks
on
the
election
washington
perched
behind
government
computers
at
a
site
in
northern
virginia
hacking
experts
are
scanning
the
networks
of
democratic
presidential
campaigns
searching
for
vulnerabilities
and
openings
to
inject
malicious
code
for
weeks
at
a
time
they're
hitting
campaign
officials
with
phishing
emails
not
unlike
those
that
russian
hackers
used
to
infiltrate
the
democratic
national
committee
in
the
campaigns
not
only
know
about
it
they've
invited
it
part
of
a
sweeping
effort
by
u.s.
national
security
agencies
to
help
campaigns
of
both
parties
protect
themselves
against
cyberattacks
intelligence
operations
and
physical
threats
ahead
of
the
election
those
efforts
come
even
while
president
donald
trump
fighting
for
another
term
continues
to
downplay
the
risk
posed
by
foreign
interference
in
u.s.
elections
as
campaigns
work
to
safeguard
their
websites
databases
and
email
systems
the
federal
government
has
been
providing
defensive
briefings
to
all
the
democratic
campaigns
that
will
take
them
u.s.
and
campaign
officials
tell
nbc
news
the
effort
has
involved
the
fbi
the
homeland
security
department
and
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
which
oversees
all
the
u.s.
spy
agencies
with
the
presidential
candidates
headquarters
scattered
across
the
country
local
fbi
field
offices
have
made
contact
with
the
campaigns
and
the
big
political
committees
providing
counterintelligence
briefings
to
those
who
want
them
in
some
cases
campaign
officials
said
the
fbi
has
informed
them
of
specific
attempts
already
under
way
by
foreign
governments
to
hack
their
campaigns
and
advised
them
about
ways
to
respond
one
major
new
concern
raised
with
campaigns
and
party
officials
has
been
increasingly
sophisticated
deep-fake
technologies
including
the
possibility
of
voice
manipulation
in
cautioning
campaigns
about
the
most
significant
threats
the
fbi
has
focused
on
russia
but
has
also
mentioned
china
and
iran
campaigns
officials
said
asked
what
tops
its
concern
list
for
presidential
campaigns
the
fbi
said
that
the
threat
from
nation-state
actors
remains
a
persistent
concern
that
the
bureau
is
working
aggressively
to
uncover
and
stop
homeland
security
through
its
cybersecurity
and
infrastructure
security
agency
has
been
notifying
campaigns
about
its
cyber
incident
response
teams
that
can
be
immediately
deployed
to
help
them
in
a
crisis
a
few
campaigns
have
even
invited
the
agency's
protective
security
advisers
to
come
to
their
headquarters
and
offices
to
perform
physical
security
assessments
dhs
officials
said
all
of
the
services
are
free
they
complement
an
array
of
cybersecurity
services
and
advice
being
offered
by
the
dnc
and
by
digidems
a
democratic
group
formed
ahead
of
the
election
that
lends
experts
to
campaigns
for
short
periods
to
help
get
their
systems
up
and
running
but
while
the
democratic
campaigns
have
broadly
accepted
dnc
help
the
track
record
of
collaborating
with
the
trump
administration
has
been
more
mixed
some
campaigns
such
as
those
for
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
former
rep
john
delaney
confirmed
they'd
been
briefed
by
the
government
others
like
former
rep
beto
o'rourke's
campaign
said
they'd
had
minimal
to
no
contact
so
far
with
u.s.
cybersecurity
officials
a
few
campaigns
including
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg's
emphasized
that
they
have
a
full-time
cybersecurity
expert
on
staff
still
other
campaigns
like
sen
cory
booker's
d-n
j.
declined
to
comment
on
any
interaction
with
u.s.
security
agencies
homeland
security
and
the
fbi
wouldn't
say
exactly
how
many
campaigns
have
accepted
briefings
or
other
help
but
matt
masterson
a
senior
adviser
on
election
security
at
homeland
security
said
the
department
has
reached
out
to
all
the
campaigns
to
establish
points
of
contact
ahead
of
time
so
that
campaigns
aren't
left
scrambling
to
find
help
if
they
do
suffer
a
breach
we've
had
good
engagement
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
including
the
republican
national
committee
and
the
trump
campaign
masterson
said
in
an
interview
we've
done
outreach
to
them
and
had
absolutely
positive
responses
but
andrew
binns
the
chief
technology
officer
of
the
democratic
national
convention
and
founder
of
cybersecurity
firm
castle
point
technologies
noted
that
these
agencies
face
an
important
obstacle
the
lack
of
security
clearances
by
most
even
senior
campaign
staff
there
should
be
a
way
for
major
campaigns
and
committees
to
apply
and
get
security
clearances
so
that
they
can
be
a
part
of
this
conversation
he
said
right
now
the
fbi
and
cyber
security
folks
on
their
side
have
information
that
might
be
useful
but
they
can't
necessarily
share
it
even
if
they
got
to
the
point
where
they
wanted
to
democratic
campaign
officials
who
have
interacted
with
the
government
experts
universally
praised
their
professionalism
yet
privately
some
campaign
officials
have
expressed
concerns
that
trump
if
fully
aware
of
the
federal
government's
efforts
might
withhold
cybersecurity
assistance
to
his
democratic
rivals
for
political
reasons
it's
unclear
whether
the
president
is
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
federal
cybersecurity
assistance
available
to
campaigns
of
both
parties
a
white
house
spokesman
didn't
respond
when
nbc
news
asked
whether
trump
supports
the
efforts
these
days
you
can
imagine
quite
a
lot
sure
we
can
imagine
that
the
government
might
find
ways
to
not
step
up
when
they
need
to
said
bob
lord
chief
security
officer
for
the
dnc
but
from
my
experience
the
career
people
at
the
government
have
been
really
fantastic
these
people
have
the
greater
democratic
process
in
mind
trump
has
waffled
since
taking
office
on
whether
he
believes
russia
meddled
in
the
election
and
has
continued
to
refer
to
the
russian
hoax
he's
repeatedly
downplayed
the
severity
of
the
threat
even
cracking
a
joke
about
it
during
a
june
meeting
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
june
trump
drew
fresh
outrage
when
asked
whether
he'd
accept
foreign
help
in
his
re-election
and
replied
i
think
i'd
take
it
that
concern
has
been
heightened
in
recent
days
amid
revelations
that
a
u.s.
intelligence
official
lodged
a
whistleblower
complaint
a
presidential
phone
call
the
washington
post
citing
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
reported
the
communication
involved
ukraine
and
a
promise
trump
made
to
a
foreign
leader
the
revelations
come
as
democrats
in
the
house
are
already
scrutinizing
whether
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
tried
to
persuade
ukraine
to
help
trump's
re-election
campaign
by
investigating
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden's
business
with
a
ukrainian
gas
company
in
the
election
u.s.
intelligence
assessments
and
detailed
indictments
from
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
found
russia
mounted
a
multi-faceted
campaign
to
influence
the
u.s.
presidential
election
including
social
media
manipulation
and
cyberattacks
on
the
dnc
aides
to
hillary
clinton
and
others
thousands
of
stolen
emails
were
then
published
the
federal
government's
work
to
help
political
campaigns
protect
themselves
is
separate
from
other
efforts
spanning
multiple
u.s.
agencies
to
protect
elections
infrastructure
such
as
voter
registration
systems
voting
machines
and
state
and
local
government
networks
national
security
officials
have
said
they
expect
foreign
adversaries
to
target
those
systems
in
in
addition
to
attacking
individual
campaigns
many
of
the
campaigns
that
spoke
to
nbc
news
said
they
were
working
most
closely
on
cybersecurity
with
the
dnc
the
official
campaign
committee
of
the
democratic
party
the
dnc
has
a
keen
interest
in
preventing
the
types
of
attacks
that
plagued
the
committee
in
the
last
election
the
dnc's
program
centers
on
a
two-page
checklist
it
says
campaigns
should
follow
to
make
their
systems
far
less
vulnerable
to
intrusion
such
as
encrypting
hard
drives
using
lengthy
password
and
regularly
installing
software
updates
to
patch
known
security
holes
the
checklist
also
encourages
campaign
staffers
to
use
password
managers
that
securely
store
passwords
and
to
enable
two-factor
authentication
on
all
accounts
including
email
file
sharing
and
social
media
the
dnc
says
campaign
staffers
should
follow
the
checklist
not
only
for
their
work
accounts
computers
and
devices
but
also
their
personal
ones
given
enough
motivation
money
time
and
resources
a
well-trained
adversary
can
accomplish
a
lot
against
you
the
goal
isn't
to
be
perfect
percent
of
the
time
said
lord
the
former
head
of
information
security
for
yahoo
before
joining
the
dnc
but
there
are
actually
things
you
can
do
to
make
it
a
lot
harder
and
more
expensive
for
adversaries
to
do
their
work
binns
said
the
interactions
between
campaigns
and
federal
law
enforcement
will
continue
to
evolve
this
is
new
for
the
fbi
too
the
fbi
has
never
had
to
do
this
he
said
the
more
that
a
campaign
engages
saying
what
can
we
do
are
you
seeing
anything
the
more
that
they
start
to
have
that
process
