lawyers

ex-fbi
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
wrote
to
federal
prosecutors
late
thursday
urging
them
not
to
keep
pursuing
charges
amid
what
they
say
are
rumors
circulating
in
washington
that
he
would
not
be
indicted
if
the
grand
jury
voted
not
to
approve
the
charges
it
did
not
find
probable
cause
therefore
it
is
simply
not
reasonable
to
believe
that
a
trial
jury
would
find
mr
mccabe
guilty
of
any
charges
mccabe's
lawyers
said
in
an
email
to
federal
prosecutors
noting
they
did
not
know
the
basis
for
the
rumors
it
had
been
expected
thursday
that
a
federal
grand
jury
would
hand
up
an
indictment
on
mccabe
allowing
prosecutors
to
move
forward
with
a
trial
on
charges
related
to
lying
to
federal
agents
about
a
disclosure
he
made
to
the
media
in
but
when
no
such
indictment
was
publicly
released
after
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
closed
on
thursday
many
suspected
the
grand
jury
had
decided
not
to
indict
him
if
prosecutors
fail
to
convince
out
of
members
of
a
grand
jury
to
indict
a
situation
known
as
a
no
true
bill
it
would
be
a
rare
occurrence
a
vote
of
no
true
bill
is
considered
to
be
a
sign
that
prosecutors
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
a
conviction
at
a
trial
where
the
standard
of
proof
is
higher
the
jury
must
be
unanimous
and
the
defense
can
attack
the
government's

on
where

mccabe's
lawyers
cited
media
reports
including
articles
in
the
new
york
times
and
the
washington
post
that
speculated
the
grand
jury
had
failed
to
indict
him
if
a
grand
jury
does
not
indict
prosecutors
may
ask
to
convene
another
grand
jury
but
it
is
also
a
long-standing
justice
department
rule
that
no
u.s.
attorney
should
move
forward
with
a
case
unless
prosecutors
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
getting
a
conviction
mccabe's
lawyers
cited
that
policy
in
their
email
we
believe
that
given
the
length
of
this
investigation
and
the
resources
devoted
to
it
this
is
not
a
case
where
authorizing
resubmission
of
the
case
to
a
grand
jury
is
consistent
with
this
standard
if
the
evidence
presented
by
your
office
was
insufficient
to
convince
members
of
the
grand
jury
to
find
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr
mccabe
had
committed
any
crimes
no
attorney
can
reasonably
believe
that
the
admissible
evidence
is
sufficient
to
obtain
a
guilty
verdict
by
an
unbiased
trier
of
fact
they
said
deputy
attorney
general
jeff
rosen
told
mccabe
on
thursday
that
his
appeal
against
possible
criminal
charges
against
him
have
been
rejected
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
decision
mccabe
authorized
the
discussion
with
the
wall
street
journal
of
the
fbi's
investigation
into
the
clinton
foundation
in
order
to
rebut
a
story
that
he
was
impartial
in
the
investigation
the
wall
street
journal
reporter
had
previously
written
about
mccabe's
wife
who
took
campaign
donations
from
hillary
clinton's
close
political
ally
terry
mcauliffe
for
her
run
in
a
state
election
in
virginia
while
mccabe
had
the
authority
to
release
such
information
to
the
media
a
report
by
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
concluded
that
he
did
so
to
advance
his
personal
interest
and
violated
the
fbi's
media
policy
the
report
also
said
mccabe
contradicted
his
statements
about
his
involvement
in
the
disclosure
to
the
newspaper
when
questioned
by
investigators
in
the
report
led
to
mccabe's
firing
without
a
pension
in
march
by
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
the
investigation's
critics
and
mccabe
supporters
have
said
he
has
been
treated
unfairly
by
those
who
wish
to
retaliate
against
him
for
his
role
in
the
the
justice
department's
investigation
into
possible
collusion
between
the
trump
campaign
and
russia
mccabe
sued
the
fbi
and
the
justice
department
in
august
claiming
that
his
firing
from
the
fbi
was
part
of
the
trump's
unconstitutional
plan
and
scheme
to
discredit
and
remove
doj
and
fbi
employees
who
were
deemed
to
be
his
partisan
opponents
because
they
were
not
politically
loyal
to
him
