washington
the
trump
administration
formally
backed
away
from
plans
to
deport
critically
ill
immigrant
children
in
a
notification
sent
to
congress
thursday
in
a
letter
sent
to
the
house
oversight
committee
the
department
of
homeland
security
said
that
it
is
resuming
its
consideration
of
non-military
deferred
action
requests
on
a
discretionary
case-by-case
basis
the
administration
as
part
of
its
broader
immigration
crackdown
had
announced
in
august
it
would
shut
down
the
medically
deferred
action
program
which
allowed
families
of
critically
ill
children
to
receive
care
in
the
united
states
without
fear
of
deportation
families
had
been
told
the
program
was
being
terminated
and
that
they
had
days
to
leave
the
country
the
decision
prompted
enormous
backlash
from
lawmakers
and
advocates
leading
the
administration
to
signal
days
later
that
it
would
at
least
temporarily
continue
allowing
medical
requests
to
be
processed
last
week
the
oversight
committee
held
a
hearing
on
the
policy
where
children
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
other
illnesses
testified
they
could
die
if
sent
back
to
their
home
countries
the
committee
was
scheduled
to
hold
an
additional
hearing
on
the
matter
next
week
with
testimony
from
ken
cuccinelli
acting
director
of
the
citizenship
and
immigration
services
and
the
acting
ice
director
matthew
albence
it
appears
that
the
trump
administration
is
reversing
its
inhumane
and
disastrous
decision
to
deport
critically
ill
children
and
their
families
who
are
receiving
life-saving
medical
treatment
in
the
united
states
