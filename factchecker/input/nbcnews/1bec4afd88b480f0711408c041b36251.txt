the
clock
no
cursing
who
will
strike
first
the
third
faceoff
takes
place
in
houston
on
thursday
night
and
features
the
top
candidates
on
stage
together
for
the
first
time
the
top
democratic
candidates
for
president
will
take
the
debate
stage
together
on
thursday
night
and
each
member
of
the
diverse
field
is
trying
to
find
a
way
to
stand
out
of
the
pack
among
them
joe
biden
hunkered
down
for
mock
debates
bernie
sanders
has
no
interest
in
practice
sessions
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
was
planning
on
trying
to
stay
loose
by
playing
some
basketball
here's
a
look
at
how
they
and
the
other
seven
candidates
who
will
take
the
stage
are
preparing
for
the
abc-sponsored
face
off
in
houston
the
third
debate
among
the
democratic
hopefuls
while
the
former
vice
president
will
share
the
stage
for
the
first
time
with
strong
contender
sen
elizabeth
warren
joe
biden's
advisers
say
he's
more
likely
to
face
direct
attacks
from
other
candidates
who
are
seeking
to
make
a
splash
biden
has
been
studying
his
rivals
records
and
is
ready
to
defend
his
regardless
of
who
is
or
isn't
attacking
joe
biden
biden
is
focused
on
running
his
race
one
adviser
said
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
full
coverage
and
alerts
about
the
debate
nonetheless
some
of
his
strategies
are
clearly
geared
toward
contrasting
his
record
and
plans
from
sweeping
changes
proposed
by
challengers
on
the
left
warren
and
bernie
sanders
biden
intends
to
stress
there's
a
difference
between
rhetoric
and
results
running
for
president
is
about
making
people's
lives
better
and
that
only
happens
if
the
change
proposed
becomes
reality
the
adviser
said
aides
say
she
has
no
plans
to
go
after
biden
and
wants
to
use
the
nationally
televised
forum
to
continue
to
introduce
herself
to
voters
but
they
note
that
warren
expects
to
be
asked
about
their
past
disagreements
she'll
defend
herself
if
attacked
but
has
no
plans
to
fire
first
the
aides
said
biden
a
longtime
former
delaware
senator
and
warren
a
consumer
advocate
and
former
bankruptcy
lawyer
have
clashed
at
times
over
the
years
notably
on
the
issue
of
credit
cards
and
their
role
in
driving
some
holders
into
debt
many
banks
and
credit
card
companies
are
headquartered
in
delaware
and
biden
was
a
reliable
advocate
for
those
firms
on
capitol
hill
if
needed
warren
will
stress
differences
between
her
and
the
other
candidates
said
adam
green
co-founder
of
the
progressive
change
campaign
committee
which
is
pro-warren
if
biden
paints
a
picture
of
a
conservative
world
and
she
paints
a
progressive
one
it's
not
a
punch
but
there
is
a
clear
contrast
green
said
his
advisers
acknowledge
the
first
on-stage
match-up
of
biden
and
warren
will
get
much
of
the
focus
sanders
was
next
to
biden
for
the
first
debate
and
next
to
pal
warren
in
the
second
but
he'll
work
to
draw
attention
to
his
new
policy
proposals
sanders
who
doesn't
do
mock
debates
to
prepare
is
ready
for
the
more
moderate
candidates
to
go
on
the
attack
against
him
you
saw
in
the
second
debate
some
people
tried
to
come
at
him
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
said
he
was
prepared
and
he
was
ready
he
and
fellow
progressive
warren
had
each
other's
backs
in
the
last
debate
and
shakir
said
he
expects
that
will
be
the
case
again
the
situation
is
still
the
same
as
last
time
in
that
you
have
in
elizabeth
warren
someone
who's
been
a
good
ally
with
bernie
on
a
lot
of
these
key
fights
shakir
said
she
made
a
splash
in
the
first
debate
sponsored
by
nbc
with
a
pointed
attack
on
biden
but
harris
is
planning
to
target
president
donald
trump
in
the
third
debate
harris
will
focus
on
bringing
the
country
together
by
defeating
him
and
unifying
americans
around
solutions
to
our
common
challenges
said
campaign
spokesman
ian
sams
she'll
make
the
connection
between
his
hatred
and
division
and
our
inability
to
get
things
done
for
the
country
she
will
also
draw
attention
to
issues
that
impact
a
broad
part
of
the
electorate
like
gun
violence
living
costs
and
healthcare
sams
said
the
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
headed
down
to
houston
for
debate
preparation
on
tuesday
and
is
aiming
to
strike
a
delicate
balance
scoring
points
against
his
opponents
without
veering
into
personal
attacks
buttigieg
said
he
wasn't
interested
in
a
canned
made-for-tv
moment
in
order
to
you
know
he
the
talk
of
the
town
that
night
he's
looking
for
ways
to
differentiate
himself
from
his
opponents
on
policy
issues
rather
than
perceived
flaws
in
their
background
or
record
he
road-tested
that
approach
over
the
past
week
with
mild
critiques
of
sanders
on
economic
policies
he
says
are
unrealistic
for
the
houston
debate
we
have
to
draw
some
sharper
contrasts
for
people
to
show
why
mayor
pete
has
such
broad-based
appeal
how
he's
different
from
some
of
the
other
candidates
on
the
stage
said
jess
o'connell
a
senior
buttigieg
adviser
the
entrepreneur
was
working
on
getting
in
the
right
headspace
by
playing
a
game
of
basketball
the
day
before
the
houston
debate
yang's
risen
in
the
polls
since
the
first
faceoff
in
june
and
his
campaign
is
readying
him
to
expect
fire
from
other
candidates
we'd
like
the
debate
to
be
about
issues
and
problems
actually
facing
america
and
less
of
a
reality
tv
show
a
senior
campaign
official
told
nbc
news
one
of
the
worst
things
you
see
candidates
do
is
try
to
get
their
viral
attack
line
in
but
the
official
said
yang
will
be
doing
something
big
and
unprecedented
on
debate
night
declining
to
provide
specific
details
the
new
jersey
senator
who's
been
known
to
do
pushups
and
bicep
curls
during
debate
preps
is
looking
at
the
forum
as
an
opportunity
to
lay
out
his
vision
with
an
emphasis
on
unity
according
to
a
campaign
aide
the
idea
of
uniting
americans
together
is
something
that
is
certainly
what
we
want
to
convey
on
the
debate
stage
the
aide
told
nbc
news
he's
also
working
on
adapting
to
the
time
constraints
by
making
sure
he
is
being
concise
but
direct
returning
to
his
home
state
of
texas
the
former
congressman
is
not
going
to
engage
in
stunts
and
one-liners
or
indulge
attempts
by
the
moderators
to
pit
candidates
against
each
other
for
the
benefit
of
good
tv
a
campaign
spokesman
said
the
seriousness
of
the
moment
demands
more
than
that
the
spokesman
said
o'rourke
will
be
communicating
the
same
message
he's
been
bringing
to
the
trail
the
last
few
weeks
including
calling
out
trump
and
offering
solutions
on
gun
violence
but
o'rourke
who's
drawn
attention
on
social
media
for
cursing
on
the
campaign
trail
will
have
to
be
family
friendly
the
democratic
national
committee
sent
a
letter
at
abc's
request
to
candidates
this
week
asking
them
to
refrain
from
swearing
on
stage
dnc
communications
director
xochi
hinojosa
confirmed
to
nbc
news
the
other
texan
in
race
arrived
in
houston
with
his
team
on
sunday
and
is
prepping
the
same
way
he
did
for
the
first
two
debates
with
mock
debates
and
practice
on
explaining
his
policies
within
the
allotted
time
limits
while
the
rules
say
candidates
will
have
more
time
to
speak
than
in
the
first
two
debates
castro's
hoping
the
limit
will
apply
equally
to
all
candidates
in
the
last
debate
he
had
about
and
a
half
minutes
of
speaking
time
compared
with
biden's
i
hope
the
folks
at
abc
are
determining
how
they're
going
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
candidates
that
are
on
that
stage
that
met
the
threshold
are
able
to
get
roughly
equal
time
if
they
don't
do
that
that
is
a
failure
castro
told
reporters
this
week
the
minnesota
senator
has
been
lagging
in
the
polls
and
her
campaign
is
hoping
her
message
of
policy
pragmatism
and
democratic
unity
will
shine
through
in
her
performance
thursday
that
approach
was
on
full
display
this
past
weekend
in
new
hampshire
where
klobuchar
pushed
an
optimistic
economic
and
justice
agenda
to
a
fired-up
room
of
democrats
