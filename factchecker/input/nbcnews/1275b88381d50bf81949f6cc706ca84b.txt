share
this
why
does
trump's
hurricane
map
look
different
from
others
the
president
has
claimed
for
days
hurricane
dorian
was
projected
to
hit
alabama
forecasters
said
it
was
not
after
days
of
claiming
without
evidence
that
alabama
was
projected
to
be
hit
by
hurricane
dorian
president
donald
trump
displayed
an
apparently
doctored
map
in
the
oval
office
on
wednesday
that
showed
alabama
to
be
within
the
storm's
path
the
map
trump
displayed
was
the
same
as
a
model
produced
by
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
last
week
showing
the
hurricane's
projected
path
cutting
through
central
florida
with
one
key
difference
where
the
original
projection
ended
a
smaller
black
circle
that
appeared
to
be
drawn
in
sharpie
was
produced
to
include
alabama
in
the
model
we
had
actually
our
original
chart
that
it
was
going
to
end
up
hitting
florida
directly
trump
said
holding
the
map
as
he
sat
in
the
oval
office
wednesday
alongside
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
it
was
going
to
be
hitting
directly
that
would
have
affected
a
lot
of
other
states
but
that
was
the
original
chart
it
was
going
to
hit
not
only
florida
georgia
it
was
going
toward
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
was
what
was
originally
projected
and
it
took
a
right
turn
and
ultimately
hopefully
we're
going
to
be
lucky
i
know
that
alabama
was
in
the
original
forecast
they
thought
it
would
get
a
piece
of
it
trump
said
later
on
wednesday
we
have
a
better
map
in
all
cases
alabama
was
hit
if
not
lightly
in
some
cases
pretty
hard
they
gave
it
a
percent
chance
asked
about
the
discrepancies
with
the
original
map
trump
said
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
hours
later
he
tweeted
another
map
dated
aug
that
showed
alabama
in
the
cross-hairs
the
image
credited
to
a
local
agency
called
the
south
florida
water
management
district
includes
fine
print
that
says
nhc
advisories
and
county
emergency
management
statements
supersede
this
project
this
graphic
should
complement
not
replace
nhc
discussions
if
anything
on
this
graphic
causes
confusion
ignore
the
entire
product
the
image
notes
the
episode
was
the
latest
in
a
bizarre
cycle
where
trump
has
doubled
and
tripled
down
on
including
alabama
among
the
states
he
said
was
in
the
hurricane's
path
it
began
sunday
morning
when
trump
tweeted
in
addition
to
florida
south
carolina
north
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
will
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
by
that
point
the
hurricane's
path
was
projected
to
go
up
the
east
coast
avoiding
alabama
looking
like
one
of
the
largest
hurricanes
ever
he
added
already
category
be
careful
god
bless
everyone
about
minutes
later
the
national
weather
service
in
birmingham
alabama
tweeted
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
we
repeat
no
impacts
from
hurricane
dorian
will
be
felt
across
alabama
the
nws
added
the
system
will
remain
too
far
east
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
news
alerts
about
hurricane
dorian
soon
after
trump
told
reporters
outside
of
marine
one
that
the
hurricane
seems
to
be
going
up
to
toward
south
carolina
toward
north
carolina
georgia
is
going
to
be
hit
alabama
is
going
to
get
a
piece
of
it
it
looks
like
but
it
can
change
its
course
again
and
it
could
go
back
more
toward
florida
trump
said
so
we'll
be
knowing
we'll
be
learning
over
the
next
probably
less
than
hours
but
it
is
a
very
very
powerful
hurricane
then
at
a
federal
emergency
management
agency
briefing
trump
attended
the
president
said
the
hurricane
may
get
a
little
piece
of
a
great
place
it's
called
alabama
adding
the
state
could
even
be
in
for
at
least
some
very
strong
winds
and
something
more
than
that
it
could
be
this
just
came
up
unfortunately
on
monday
trump
was
upset
over
an
abc
news
report
pointing
out
the
alabama
claim
tweeting
such
a
phony
hurricane
report
by
lightweight
reporter
jonkarl
of
abcworldnews
i
suggested
yesterday
at
fema
that
along
with
florida
georgia
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
even
alabama
could
possibly
come
into
play
which
was
true
they
made
a
big
deal
about
this
when
in
fact
under
certain
original
scenarios
it
was
in
fact
correct
that
alabama
could
have
received
some
hurt
he
added
always
good
to
be
prepared
but
the
fake
news
is
only
interested
in
demeaning
and
belittling
didn't
play
my
whole
sentence
or
statement
bad
people
when
asked
about
the
map
issue
a
noaa
spokesperson
told
nbc
to
please
contact
the
white
house
press
office
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
the
map
from
nbc
news
in
a
statement
to
cnn
earlier
this
week
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
said
trump
was
told
during
a
briefing
at
camp
david
that
was
important
that
the
focus
shouldn't
be
on
the
line
or
track
of
the
hurricane
full
coverage
latest
stories
and
video
on
hurricane
dorian
that
despite
where
dorian
would
ultimately
make
landfall
the
expanse
of
the
wind
field
is
large
and
there
was
still
a
lot
of
uncertainty
she
added
his
comments
were
simply
noting
those
points
and
with
alabama's
proximity
to
florida
it
makes
sense
disseminating
knowingly
false
weather
reports
is
against
federal
law
whoever
knowingly
issues
or
publishes
any
counterfeit
weather
forecast
or
warning
of
weather
conditions
falsely

such
forecast
or
