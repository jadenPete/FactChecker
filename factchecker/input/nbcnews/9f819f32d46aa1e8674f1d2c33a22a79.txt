political
standing
was
on
the
line
in
the
closely

district
charlotte
n.c.
republican
dan
bishop
narrowly
defeated
democrat
dan
mccready
in
a
special
election
on
tuesday
in
north
carolina's
th
congressional
district
the
race
was
being
closely
watched
for
possible
signs
of
weakness
among
republican
voters
that
could
have
spelled
bad
news
nationally
in
for
president
donald
trump
who
endorsed
bishop
and
campaigned
for
him
on
monday
a
special
election
was
called
in
the
district
after
last
year's
results
weren't
certified
due
to
allegations
of
fraud
bishop
was
ahead
with
percent
or
votes
and
mccready
had
percent
or
votes
with
about
percent
of
the
tally
in
nbc
news
projected
bishop
as
the
winner
shortly
after
pm
et
full
results
available
here
democrats
said
trump's
unpopularity
is
the
only
reason
the
gop-leaning
district
was
competitive
in
the
first
place
and
that
republicans
needed
to
pull
out
all
the
stops
to
win
it
and
looking
ahead
to
next
year
democrats
say
there
are
republican-held
congressional
districts
that
are
more
competitive
than
this
one
but
trump's
rally
and
vocal
support
may
have
helped
push
bishop
over
the
line
and
the
president
was
quick
to
take
credit
for
the
win
bishop
thanked
trump
and
other
republicans
in
his
victory
speech
saying
his
first
act
in
congress
would
be
to
help
the
president
build
a
wall
along
the
mexican
border
under
this
president
america
is
great
again
he
said
we
stand
for
our
flag
and
we
kneel
for
our
maker
bishop
then
pulled
out
his
iphone
and
called
the
white
house
from
the
podium
to
put
the
president
on
speakerphone
so
his
supporters
could
hear
what
he
did
tonight
is
monumental
trump
said
as
bishop
held
his
phone
to
microphone
so
congratulations
every
one
of
the
dozen
voters
who
spoke
with
nbc
news
in
indian
trail
a
suburb
of
charlotte
said
the
president
was
a
factor
in
their
vote
i
recently
changed
my
affiliation
from
republican
said
dawn
leavesley
who
voted
for
trump
in
but
has
been
disappointed
with
him
dan
mccready
promises
to
vote
for
the
people
not
for
party
and
even
though
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
either
party
on
different
things
i
believe
that
he's
the
best
man
for
the
job
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
both
parties
poured
millions
of
dollars
into
the
race
with
democrats
spending
about
million
on
tv
and
radio
ads
while
republicans
spent
about
million
according
to
data
from

analytics
the
th
congressional
district
which
includes
parts
of
charlotte
and
fayetteville
suburbs
and
large
swath
of
rural
territory
in
between
has
been
held
by
republicans
since
trump
won
it
by
percentage
points
in
the
results
point
to
ongoing
trouble
for
both
parties
bishop
lost
ground
in
the
suburbs
while
mccready
underperformed
in
some
of
the
district's
rural
areas
mccready
a
solar
energy
entrepreneur
and
former
marine
ran
as
a
moderate
who
pledged
to
put
country
over
party
and
rejected
many
the
progressive
policies
of
his
party's
presidential
candidates
we
were
not
successful
tonight
but
i
want
you
to
remember
that
victory
postponed
is
not
defeat
he
told
supporters
tuesday
in
his
concession
speech
mccready
made
the
contest
in
conservative
district
competitive
thanks
to
a
head
start
and
the
national
undercurrent
of
blowback
against
trump
in
last
year's
race
gop
nominee
mark
harris
led
mccready
by
votes
but
was
never
given
a
seat
in
congress
after
allegations
emerged
that
a
consultant
working
for
him
had
improperly
handled
absentee
ballots
a
new
election
was
ordered
and
republicans
chose
a
different
nominee
for
the
do-over
bishop
a
state
senator
who
backed
the
state's
controversial
bathroom
bill
which
prohibited
transgender
people
from
using
the
bathrooms
and
locker
rooms
that
align
with
their
gender
identity
while
the
race
did
not
have
major
implications
for
the
balance
of
power
in
the
house
republicans
were
aware
that
losing
the
seat
would
have
required
them
to
win
one
extra
one
instead
of
to
reclaim
the
house
majority
in
bishop
and
gop
outside
groups
field-tested
the
kinds
of
attacks
they
may
use
against
other
democrats
next
year
especially
on
immigration
the
results
tonight
are
the
clearest
sign
yet
that
the
left's
embrace
of
socialism
is
putting
even
their
strongest
and
best-funded
candidates
in
dire
jeopardy
said
dan
conston
the
president
of
the
congressional
leadership
fund
a
gop
super
pac
that
argument
worked
for
voter
richard
swindler
who
said
he
wants
his
representative
in
congress
to
have
the
president's
back
i
know
that
the
other
dan
mccready
would
have
sided
with
pelosi
and
that
gang
and
dan
bishop
will
probably
side
with
trump
and
his
gang
and
i
believe
that's
the
right
side
of
the
fence
to
be
on
swindler
said
democrats
had
hoped
a
win
in
the
traditionally
republican
suburbs
here
would
not
only
help
protect
their
house
majority
but
energize
the
party
heading
into
next
year's
presidential
election
tonight's
razor-thin
result
in
this
ruby-red
district
solidifies
the
fact
that
democrats
are
pushing
further
into
republican
strongholds
and
are
in
a
commanding
position
to
protect
and
expand
our
house
majority
in
