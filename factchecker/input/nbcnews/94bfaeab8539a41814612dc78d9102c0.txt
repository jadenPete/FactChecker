the

ammunition
and
ask

to
no
longer
openly
carry
firearms
in
its
stores

expanding
its
campaign
nbc
news
has
learned
the
group
has
issued
an
open
letter
calling
on
u.s.
companies
to
break
financial
or
business
ties
with
the
national
rifle
association
and
to
stop
making
political
donations
to
nra-backed
lawmakers
after
the
recent
mass
shootings
in
ohio
and
texas
we
have
been
reminded
of
the
painfully
high
cost
we
all
pay
and
the
toll
gun
violence
takes
on
our
families
friends
communities
and
neighbors
wrote
leaders
of
the
coalition
that
includes
gun
safety
groups

moveon
among
others
if
congress
won't
act
it's
time
that
you
do
the
group
wrote
adding
american
employers
are
already
doing
more
than
congress
to
keep
us
safe
from
gun
violence
igor
volsky
director
of
guns
down
america
told
nbc
news
that
with
the
holiday
shopping
season
approaching
the
campaign
is
likely
to
target
some
of
the
nation's
other
large
retailers
after
walmart's
actions
the
coalition
is
choosing
specific
targets
now
before
building
campaigns
around
them
in
the
coming
weeks
he
said
the
effort
marks
a
hard
pivot
by
activists
long
frustrated
by
a
decades-long
stalemate
in
congress
over
stricter
gun
laws
to
press
corporate
america
to
take
the
lead
in
addressing
the
nation's
gun
violence
epidemic
u.s.
gun
deaths
have
reached
their
highest
level
in
nearly
years
according
to
the
u.s.
centers
for
disease
control
we
feel
like
conscripting
american
corporations
in
building
a
future
with
fewer
guns
is
where
the
future
is
trending
legislative
change
is
going
to
take
a
long
time
and
we
need
to
find
other
avenues
to
move
this
along
in
the
effort
of
saving
lives
volsky
said
on
tuesday
gop
congressional
leaders
met
at
the
white
house
about
the
legislative
agenda
for
fall
and
discussed
whether
it
would
include
action
on
guns
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
repeatedly
said
he
would
only
put
legislation
on
the
floor
that
president
trump
would
sign
yet
trump
has
gone
back
and
forth
on
whether
he
would
support
expanded
background
checks
the
democratic-controlled
house
passed
comprehensive
background
check
legislation
in
february
and
the
senate
shows
no
signs
of
taking
it
up
in
the
aftermath
of
the
shooting
in
an
el
paso
walmart
last
month
the
coalition
came
together
to
stage
rallies
launch
a
petition
and
urge
americans
to
hand
deliver
letters
to
local
walmart
managers
asking
them
to
end
all
gun
and
ammunition
sales
and
break
ties
with
the
nra
on
sept
walmart
the
nation's
largest
retailer
said
it
would
end
all
handgun
ammunition
sales
and
ask
customers
not
to
carry
guns
into
stores
it
will
continue
to
sell
long
barrel
deer
rifles
and
shotguns
and
much
of
the
ammunition
for
those
guns
it's
the
latest
step
from
walmart
to
scale
back
the
sale
of
weapons
and
ammunition
including
stopping
the
sale
of
handguns
everywhere
but
alaska
and
ending
sales
of
modern
sporting
rifles
and
starting
last
year
volsky
pointed
to
a
number
of
other
companies
that
have
already
taken
the
initiative
including
in
the
aftermath
of
the
shooting
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
parkland
florida
in
that
killed
people
first
national
bank
of
omaha
said
it
would
not
renew
a
contract
with
the
nra
to
issue
a
branded
visa
card
enterprise
holdings
inc
the
car
rental
company
announced
it
would
cut
off
discounts
for
nra
members
while
allied
and
north
american
van
lines
the
moving
service
providers
terminated
discounts
for
nra
members
citigroup
also
set
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
firearms
by
its
business
customers
becoming
the
first
wall
street
bank
to
take
such
a
stance
the
coalition
said
walmart's
actions
should
accelerate
corporate
america's
march
toward
gun
safety
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action
walmart's
actions
established
a
higher
standard
for
corporate
responsibility
in
the
gun
reform
arena
and
we're
glad
kroger
walgreens
wegmans
and
cvs
have
also
moved
in
the
right
direction
but
we
believe
that
every
major
american
employer
has
a
moral
and
patriotic
duty
to
go
even
further
