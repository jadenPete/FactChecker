children
not
exempt
from
trump's
toughest
asylum
policy
officials
say
the
new
enforcement
will
include
turning
back
children
who
arrive
at
the
southern
border
without
their
parents
following
the
supreme
court's
decision
to
allow
the
trump
administration
to
go
forward
with
its
toughest
asylum
policy
to
date
officials
from
the
department
of
justice
and
homeland
security
on
friday
detailed
how
they
would
begin
enforcement
including
by
turning
back
children
who
arrive
at
the
southern
border
without
their
parents
the
new
policy
would
make
asylum
seekers
ineligible
if
they
passed
through
another
country
on
their
way
to
the
united
states
and
did
not
first
seek
asylum
there
the
officials
said
they
will
return
immigrants
who
arrived
in
the
u.s.
on
or
after
july
to
their
home
countries
if
they
cannot
prove
they
sought
asylum
elsewhere
immigration
and
human
rights
advocates
have
decried
the
policy
claiming
it
is
in
violation
of
the
international
right
to
claim
asylum
regardless
of
how
one
arrives
in
the
country
where
they
are
seeking
protection
those
arguments
are
still
playing
out
in
lower
courts
which
could
ultimately
end
in
the
policy's
reversal
even
if
asylum
seekers
are
denied
protection
by
another
country
they
are
still
eligible
to
apply
in
the
united
states
a
dhs
official
said
if
they
can
prove
they
tried
to
seek
it
elsewhere
the
officials
said
unaccompanied
migrant
children
are
awarded
some
additional
protections
but
will
not
be
exempt
from
the
rule
some
exceptions
do
apply
for
example
if
an
asylum
seeker
can
prove
to
u.s.
authorities
that
he
or
she
has
a
fear
of
torture
if
returned
home
they
would
be
allowed
to
seek
protection
under
the
convention
against
torture
in
the
united
states
immigrants
can
also
appeal
their
deportation
decisions
to
an
immigration
judge
the
trump
administration
has
said
the
new
policy
is
necessary
to
weed
out
asylum
claims
that
are
not
likely
to
end
in
a
favorable
decision
in
court
currently
the
majority
of
initial
claims
for
asylum
are
accepted
but
then
ultimately
denied
by
a
judge
due
to
a
court
backlog
of
over
asylum
claims
many
asylum
seekers
live
in
the
united
states
for
years
before
their
court
date
or
do
not
show
up
for
their
hearing
