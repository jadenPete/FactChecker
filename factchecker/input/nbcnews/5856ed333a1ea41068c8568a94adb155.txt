said
he

it
to
be
the

political
gathering
a

among
the

win
the

buckley
hopes
to

record
of

at

it

which

they're

he
said
the

have

biden's

relies
on
his
existing
relationships
in
the
state
while
sharing
the
former
vice
president's
record
with
younger
voters
at
youth-oriented
events
the
team
has
spent
weeks
reaching
out
to
moderate
voters
including
republicans
in
traditionally
red
areas
they're
using
biden's
name
recognition
and
experience
to
make
an
electability
argument
as
did
his
wife
jill
when
she
campaigned
on
his
behalf
here
last
month
as
evidenced
by
the
vast
amount
of
public
polling
where
we
see
the
vp's
electability
as
one
of
his
top
strengths
in
winning
because
people
know
that
he's
our
best
shot
at
beating
trump
i
think
we're
seeing
a
really
positive
response
to
that
state
director
ian
moskowitz
said
warren's
power
in
numbers
while
buttigieg
recently
surpassed
warren's
infrastructure
in
size
she's
been
steadily
building
hers
for
the
past
eight
months
focusing
on
direct
voter
contact
the
campaign
doesn't
often
tout
or
even
release
staff
volunteer
or
endorsement
figures
but
uses
a
state-based
campaign
twitter
account
to
share
glimpses
of
its
ground
efforts
from
campus
events
to
parades
going
beyond
traditional

said
they
aim
to
build
the
strongest
organization
in
the
state
and
exceed
voter
turnout
expectations
estimating
their
aggressive
ground
operation
has
already
contacted
percent
of
likely
primary
voters
when
sanders
who
has
held
public
events
across
six
trips
here
isn't
in
the
state
the
campaign
relies
on
surrogates
like
california
rep
ro
khanna
sanders-affiliated
our
revolution
president
nina
turner
and
ben
cohen
co-founder
of
vermont-based
ben
jerry's
we
have
a
candidate
in
bernie
sanders
who
doesn't
really
love
talking
about
himself
shakir
said
oftentimes
it's
the
surrogates
it's
people
like
myself
who
interact
with
him
on
a
daily
basis
coming
here
and
telling
people
about
the
side
of
bernie

you
may
not
always
see
and
hear
about

and
love
new
phase
for
buttigieg
buttigieg
recently
entered
a
new
phase
of
his
state
campaign
featuring
a
heavy
field
office
and
staff
investment
he's
drawing
some
of
the
biggest
crowds
so
far
this
cycle
including
more
than
people
at
a
recent
town-hall-style
event
at
a
dover
park
buttigieg's
state
team
is
focusing
on
organizing
based
on
personal
relationships
and
ensuring
that
people
have
the
tools
and
language
to
communicate
with
their
own
friends
and
family

jess

a
senior

i
can
only
imagine
what
it's
like
to
be
a
voter
in
new
hampshire
getting
plus
calls
and
door
knocks
and
hearing
from
everyone
she
said
and
so
we're
really
focused
on
making
sure
that
friends
are
reaching
out
to
friends
and
family
is
talking
to
family
and
co-workers

less
than
most
of
the
candidates
with
events
across
four
trips
to
the
state
since
announcing
her
candidacy
but
her
new
hampshire
team
is
spreading
her
vibrant
brand
through
both
traditional
outreach
activities
like
nightly
phone
banks
and
weekends
volunteering
in
local
communities
and
youth-focused
programs
such
as

which
aims
to

isn't
a
top-polling
candidate
but
he
has
a
top-tier
infrastructure
with
staff
across
a
headquarters
and
three
field
offices
his
state
campaign
was
one
of
the
first
to
knock
on
doors
and
talk
directly
to
voters
the
campaign
has
gone
outside
the
box
holding
virtual

but
the
campaign
also
stresses
community
service
we've
had
a
lot
of
service
days
of
action
and
making
sure
we're
leaving
these
communities
better
than
where
they
are
state

said

that
investment
has
yet
to
pay
off

has
garnered
about

from
local

and
