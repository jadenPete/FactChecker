this
next
one
out
booker
memo
warns
he
may
not
be
in
race
much
longer
the
democratic
presidential
candidate's
campaign
manager
warned
the
nj
senator
might
not
stick
around
if
he
can't
raise
nearly
m
in
days
washington
sen
cory
booker
must
raise
nearly
million
in
the
next
days
or
the
presidential
candidate
has
no
legitimate
long-term
path
forward
according
to
a
memo
to
staff
from
the
campaign
manager
obtained
by
nbc
news
the
struggling
candidate's
campaign
manager
addisu
demissie
warned
that
after
weaker-than-expected
fundraising
in
the
early
part
of
september
the
campaign
needs
to
rake
in
another
million
before
the
last
day
of
the
financial
quarter
on
sept
without
a
fundraising
surge
to
close
out
this
quarter
we
do
not
see
a
legitimate
long-term
path
forward
demissie
wrote
in
the
saturday
memo
to
staff
and
supporters
the
next
days
will
determine
whether
cory
booker
can
stay
in
this
race
booker
was
one
of
the
first
candidates
to
build
a
substantial
operation
in
critical
early
states
and
his
ground
game
in
iowa
has
been
praised
by
local
activists
but
the
large
headcount
is
expensive
demissie
said
the
campaign
has
enough
money
to
keep
going
at
its
current
pace
if
it
wanted
to
but
not
enough
to
expand
operations
before
voting
starts
early
next
year
and
that
booker
doesn't
want
stay
in
the
race
if
he
doesn't
think
he
can
win
if
our
campaign
is
not
in
a
financial
position
to
grow
he's
not
going
to
continue
to
consume
resources
and
attention
that
can
be
used
to
focus
on
beating
donald
trump
which
needs
to
be
everyone's
first
priority
demissie
wrote
booker's
campaign
has
struggled
nationally
he
averages
at
just
under
percent
support
in
the
polls
according
to
real
clear
politics
he
warned
other
candidates
were
in
similar
situations
and
that
the
historically
large
field
is
about
to
narrow
dramatically
booker
might
not
be
in
this
race
for
much
longer
the
same
is
true
for
other
important
voices
in
the
field
demissie
wrote
he
argued
there
probably
only
four
campaigns
with
the
money
necessary
to
build
and
sustain
the
national
organization
needed
to
win
presumably
referring
to
former
vice
president
joe
biden
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
and
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
indiana
who
raised
more
money
last
quarter
than
any
other
candidate
candidates
often
use
sky-is-falling
language
in
fundraising
emails
but
demissie
insisted
that
is
not
the
case
for
booker
even
if
he
is
hoping
to
use
the
warning
to
raise
money
i
want
to
be
clear
this
isn't
an
end-of-quarter
stunt
or
another
one
of
those
memos
from
a
campaign
trying
to
spin
the
press
he
wrote
this
is
a
real
unvarnished
look
under
the
hood
of
our
operation
at
a
level
of
transparency
unprecedented
in
modern
presidential
campaigns
booker
and
the
rest
of
the
democratic
field
will
address
iowa
democrats
at
the
polk
county
steak
fry
saturday
as
some
candidates
have
begun
taking
more
drastic
action
to
try
to
shake
up
what
has
been
a
surprisingly
static
race
so
far
starting
there
booker
and
his
campaign
will
try
to
remind
democrats
why
they
made
the
former
newark
mayor
a
national
star
in
the
first
place
and
what
they
might
miss
if
he
were
to
exit
the
race
such
as
his
powerful
optimistic
oratory
and
roots
in
a
poor
inner-city
neighborhood
according
to
aides
the
fourth
quarter's
when
you
gotta
grow
booker
told
msnbc's
vaughn
hillyard
at
steak
fry
grow
or
get
out
and
we
are
not
in
this
for
an
ego
exercise
this
is
not
a
vanity
play
i'm
in
this
to
win
the
nomination
and
beat
donald
trump
and
so
if
you
believe
in
my
campaign
if
you
believe
in
my
voice
being
on
this
stage
this
is
a
determining
moment
for
us
we
either
are
going
to
reach
a
million
dollars
to
stay
in
this
race
or
we're
gonna
have
to
make
really
tough
decisions
at
the
end
of
this
quarter
and
in
a
bid
to
sell
transparency
the
campaign
will
keep
a
constantly
updating
tracker
of
their
progress
toward
the
million
goal
booker
is
a
crowd
favorite
at
candidate
events
and
he's
on
many
voters
list
of
potential
favorites
to
support
even
though
he
occupies
the
top
slot
for
a
much
smaller
number
but
his
campaign
will
lean
into
that
urging
rank-and-file
democrats
to
chip
into
to
keep
him
in
the
race
even
if
they're
not
planning
to
vote
for
him
minyon
moore
a
veteran
democratic
strategist
who
is
neutral
in
the
race
and
has
donated
to
multiple
candidates
said
while
she
understands
voters
fatigue
with
the
massive
field
booker
is
a
valuable
addition
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
travesty
not
to
have
him
in
the
race
she
said
we
need
him
in
the
race
his
race
is
one
factor
but
his
voice
is
another
factor
money
is
typically
what
forces
candidates
out
of
a
presidential
contest
new

city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
on
