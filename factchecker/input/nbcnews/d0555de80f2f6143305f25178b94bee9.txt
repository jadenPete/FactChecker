case
a
new
york
judge
on
friday
ordered
president
donald
trump
to
answer
questions
under
oath
for
a
civil
suit
in
the
bronx
involving
his
security
guards
state
supreme
court
justice
doris
gonzalez
ordered
trump
to
appear
for
a
videotaped
deposition
prior
to
the
trial
the
trial
which
involves
a
group
of
protesters
who
allege
they
were
assaulted
by
trump's
security
guards
outside
trump
tower
during
a
protest
over
the
then-candidate's
comments
about
mexican
immigrants
some
of
which
was
caught
on
video
is
slated
to
begin
on
thursday
sept
the
judge
rejected
the
argument
of
trump's
attorneys
that
he
should
not
have
to
testify
because
of
his
duties
as
president
lawyers
for
trump
and
the
trump
organization
which
is
also
a
defendant
in
the
case
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
attorney
benjamin
dictor
who's
representing
the
plaintiffs
said
the
decision
is
not
surprising
it
may
be
newsworthy
but
it's
not
surprising
no
one
is
above
the
law
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
ruling
says
trump's
testimony
is
indispensable
to
the
case
since
the
protesters
charge
that
the
bodyguards
were
working
on
trump's
behalf
the
judge
stopped
short
of
ordering
the
president
to
take
the
witness
stand
in
the
bronx
citing
a
u.s.
supreme
court
ruling
in
a
civil
case
involving
sexual
harassment
allegations
against
then-president
bill
clinton
that
ruling
said
the
testimony
of
president
may
be
taken
at
the
white
house
at
a
time
that
will
accommodate
his
busy
schedule
and
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
the
president
to
attend
in
person
though
he
could
elect
to
do
so
gonzalez
also
cited
a
more
recent
ruling
in
a
new
york
case
where
trump
was
ordered
to
sit
for
a
deposition
in
a
defamation
case
brought
against
him
by
a
former
apprentice
contestant
summer
zervos
after
the
ruling
was
handed
down
dictor
sent
trump
attorney
lawrence
rosen
a
letter
asking
that
he
advise
what
date
time
and
location
will
be
made
available
to
appear
to
testify
he
said
he
had
yet
to
hear
back
