share
this
things
to
watch
at
thursday's
democratic
debate
in
houston
analysis
biden
vs
the
left
and
four
more
subplots
as
the
culling
continues
houston
one
night
only
for
the
first
time
the
democratic
presidential
debate
field
has
been
culled
to
the
point
that
all
qualifiers
can
compete
on
a
single
stage
on
the
same
night
here
on
thursday
that
means
democratic
voters
will
get
a
look
at
the
front-runners
in
the
polls
former
vice
president
joe
biden
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
in
action
against
one
another
and
against
the
tiers
of
candidates
trying
to
break
through
before
the
iowa
caucuses
in
february
it
is
biden
and
warren
first
and
second
in
most
recent
national
polling
who
avoided
each
other
by
the
luck
of
the
draw
in
the
first
set
of
democratic
debates
in
miami
in
june
and
detroit
in
july
biden
and
his
aides
have
hinted
strongly
in
recent
days
that
he
may
go
after
warren
at
least
indirectly
but
she's
succeeded
in
two
previous
debates
by
sticking
to
her
policy
agenda
and
her
rollout
of
a
new
social
security
plan
on
thursday
suggests
she
doesn't
want
to
spend
much
time
talking
about
herself
or
the
other
candidates
here
are
five
things
to
watch
for
at
thursday
night's
abc
news-hosted
debate
at
texas
southern
university
last
time
they
were
on
stage
together
warren
and
sanders
essentially
locked
arms
and
formed
a
phalanx
against
more
centrist
candidates
with
warren
making
a
case
for
what
she
calls
big
structural
change
and
sanders
still
calling
for
a
political
revolution
biden
has
been
the
chief
counterweight
to
liberalism
in
the
primary
contest
so
far
but
heading
into
thursday's
debate
he's
been
losing
ground
at
his
peak
in
early
may
biden
crested
at
more
than
percent
in
the
real
clear
politics
average
of
national
polls
with
a
bigger
share
of
democratic
primary
support
than
the
next
five
candidates
combined
now
with
percent
biden
has
less
than
the
tandem
of
sanders
percent
and
warren
percent
it
doesn't
take
a
political
savant
to
understand
that
the
threat
from
his
left
has
grown
rather
than
subsided
or
that
most
of
the
change
has
come
from
warren
gaining
biden's
team
has
previewed
an
argument
that
warren's
vaunted
plans
aren't
plausible
he
may
try
to
tie
warren
to
sanders
and
argue
their
dreams
are
too
big
to
succeed
whether
that's
a
salient
point
in
the
time
of
president
donald
trump
and
whether
biden
can
sell
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
warren
wants
to
communicate
to
voters
is
simple
according
to
an
aide
how
she
plans
to
fix
what
she
sees
as
broken
in
america
that's
not
about
the
other
candidates
or
even
about
trump
except
to
the
extent
that
his
policies
have
contributed
in
her
telling
to
the
state
of
dysfunction
but
as
the
candidate
who
has
ascended
from
relatively
negligible
support
at
the
start
of
the
race
to
the
top
tier
she
can
expect
to
be
the
target
of
attacks
from
her
rivals
thursday
night
that
figures
to
test
her
ability
to
keep
her
focus
on
policies
and
not
personalities
and
on
what
she
thinks
are
the
right
remedies
to
help
voters
if
warren
gets
dragged
into
a
lot
of
back-and-forth
on
her
own
record
or
even
the
details
of
her
vision
rather
than
the
broader
messaging
that
has
worked
for
her
so
far
that's
territory
she
doesn't
want
to
be
in
in
sanders
had
the
anti-establishment
vote
all
to
himself
but
this
time
around
his
coalition
has
fractured
among
other
candidates
for
the
democrats
who
want
revolutionary
change
he's
struggled
to
differentiate
himself
enough
from
warren
to
prevent
her
rise
and
for
democrats
who
are
wary
of
nominating
a
woman
in
the
shadow
of
hillary
clinton's
defeat
he
hasn't
given
them
enough
of
a
reason
to
pick
him
over
biden
this
debate
gives
sanders
a
chance
to
carve
a
path
for
himself
that
pulls
voters
from
both
camps
toward
him
and
away
from
the
other
front-runners
but
he'll
have
to
draw
strong
contrasts
to
do
that
history
suggests
a
frontal
assault
on
rival
democrats
but
his
best
play
might
be
showing
that
he
can
take
a
democratic
socialist
fight
to
trump
as
well
as
or
better
than
warren
can
with
her
liberal
capitalist
approach
or
biden
can
with
his
center-left
platform
watch
for
him
to
go
after
the
donald
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
currently
fourth
in
the
polls
has
had
big
moments
good
and
bad
in
her
previous
two
debates
she's
shown
she
can
play
on
the
big
stage
and
command
attention
but
what
she
hasn't
demonstrated
is
consistency
either
in
the
debates
or
on
the
campaign
trail
democratic
voters
will
be
looking
to
see
whether
she's
able
to
turn
in
a
solid
performance
from
start
to
finish
that
includes
some
of
the
flashes
of
brilliance
they
like
on
political
questions
but
more
of
an
ability
to
sustain
her
presence
on
substance
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
indiana
faded
into
the
background
in
his
first
two
debate
performances
skilled
at
the
art
of
creating
big
moments
for
himself
when
he's
the
only
candidate
at
a
town
hall
or
on
the
campaign
trail
he's
struggled
for
oxygen
when
matched
against
rivals
can
he
step
up
and
show
he's
a
boss
rather
than
the
young
guy
who
gets
plaudits
for
winning
a
seat
at
the
adult
table
and
behaving
himself
for
the
candidates
on
the
edges
of
the
stage
those
polling
worst
and
in
danger
of
being
knocked
out
of
the
race
sooner
rather
than
later
it's
time
to
go
big
or
go
home
and
it's
probably
not
enough
to
just
land
a
punch
or
two
on
one
of
the
front-runners
there's
a
lot
of
risk
in
gimmicks
and
it's
likely
one
or
two
will
implode
with
a
grand
last
gasp
but
it's
possible
for
one
candidate
to
turn
in
the
performance
of
his
or
her
life
with
a
new
frame
and
new
policy
wrinkle
or
two
and
earn
a
second
look
from
voters
there's
not
much
reason
to
hold
back
now
