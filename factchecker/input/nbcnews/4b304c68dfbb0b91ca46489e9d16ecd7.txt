mcconnell
for
his
part
said
last
week
in
an
interview
with
radio
host
hugh
hewitt
that
he
expected
to
hear
from
the
white
house
within
a
week
what
type
of
legislative
response
the
president
might
accept
on
the
issue
after
the
spate
of
mass
shootings
last
month
trump
expressed
some
openness
to
stronger
background
checks
but
then
wavered
following
conversations
with
national
rifle
association
leaders
his
recent
statements
have
focused
more
on
proposals
to
address
mental
health
speaking
on
the
senate
floor
monday
afternoon
mcconnell
laid
out
what
the
upper
chamber
plans
to
address
this
fall
which
he
said
includes
approving
nominations
and
passing
government
funding
he
made
no
mention
of
gun
legislation
leader
mcconnell
did
not
even
mention
gun
violence
in
his
opening
remarks
today
after
promising
that
we
would
have
a
debate
in
the
senate
when
we
returned
we
await
word
from
the
leader
when
that
debate
might
take
place
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
said
on
the
senate
floor
afterward
one
thing
we
do
know
is
that
leader
mcconnell
has
said
that
the
question
of
background
checks
will
come
down
to
president
trump
if
the
president
took
a
position
on
a
bill
leader
mcconnell
said
i'd
be
happy
to
put
it
on
the
floor
that's
what
he
said
those
are
his
words
thune
leaving
a
meeting
of
senate
republican
leadership
monday
confirmed
the
caucus
was
waiting
for
guidance
from
trump
i
can
say
i
think
all
of
our
members
at
least
if
this
meeting
was
any
indication
believe
that
the
president
needs
to
indicate
what
it
is
he
would
be
for
we're
obviously
very
interested
in
knowing
what
they
are
what
his
plan
or
proposal
is
and
what
he
would
be
willing
to
sign
democrats
have
been
calling
on
mcconnell
to
take
up
a
bill
the
house
passed
in
february
that
would
expand
background
checks
but
the
white
house
issued
a
veto
threat
on
the
measure
some
proposals
that
the
white
house
is
considering
include
a
background
checks
bill
pushed
by
sens
joe
manchin
d-w
va
and
pat
toomey
r-pa
a
red
flag
bill
and
a
measure
that
would
increase
penalties
for
people
buying
a
gun
for
someone
else
to
circumvent
background
checks
vice
president
mike
pence
has
also
been
pushing
the
idea
of
accelerating
the
death
penalty
for
people
who
carry
out
a
mass
murder
though
most
mass
shooters
don't
survive
the
shootings
if
such
a
provision
is
tied
into
a
comprehensive
gun
package
that
could
be
a
deal-breaker
for
democrats
it
remained
unclear
what
measures
rank-and-file
senate
republicans
actually
supported
if
any
and
which
might
they
be
willing
to
vote
for
asked
monday
if
the
senate
should
take
up
some
kind
of
gun
control
measure
sen
john
kennedy
r-la
told
reporters
that
he's
willing
to
talk
about
possible
proposals
but
sounded
a
cautious
note
on
any
potential
action
here's
my
starting
point
i
said
it
the
other
day
i
do
believe
love
is
the
answer
but
i
own
a
handgun
just
in
case
kennedy
said
i'm
interested
in
facts
and
i
want
to
see
the
causal
scientific
evidence
with
gun
restriction
proposals
because
we're
dealing
with
people's
constitutional
rights
heading
into
a
closed-door
caucus
meeting
tuesday
morning
pelosi
gave
a
measured
response
when
asked
by
reporters
what
her
understanding
is
of
where
trump
stands
on
background
checks
i'm
hopeful
i'm
prayerful
she
said
in
an
interview
with
nbc
news
monday
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
rejected
the
idea
of
a
measure
floated
by
white
house
officials
that
would
only
take
guns
away
from
those
who
are
mentally
ill
it
is
not
an
acceptable
starting
point
nadler
said
the
president
said
after
one
of
the
mass
shootings
he
will
support
background
checks
then
he
spoke
with
the
nra
and
said
he
wouldn't
he
added
toomey
also
sounded
a
cautious
note
on
tuesday
look
i'm
still
hopeful
this
is
always
difficult
he
told
reporters
when
asked
if
he
was
optimistic
there
might
be
some
movement
on
the
issue
this
was
never
going
to
be
easy
the
pennsylvania
senator
said
he
had
spoken
with
the
president
many
times
about
potential
solutions
the
president
is
interested
in
doing
something
in
this
space
and
i
think
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
is
some
variation
on
manchin-toomey
he
said
i
think
the
idea
of
having
background
checks
on
commercial
gun
sales
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
and
is
very
broadly
supported
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
give
up
yet
and
i
don't
intend
to
