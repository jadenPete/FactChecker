the

made
a
rally
pitch
for
hispanic

lost

president
donald
trump
looking
to
put
new
mexico
in
play
in
sought
to
win
over
hispanic
voters
at
a
rally
here
monday
the
president's
pitch
to
hispanic
voters
seemed
to
silo
them
off
from
the
rest
of
the
electorate
including
the
rally
crowd
we
love
our
hispanics
it
featured
an
assertion
that
they
had
a
greater
understanding
of
the
source
of
the
drug
problem
than
other
americans
and
it
included
a
section
in
which
trump
wondered
how
cnn
contributor
steve
cortes
could
be
hispanic
even
though
the
president
said
he
appeared
to
be
of
northern
european
descent
he
happens
to
be
hispanic
but
i
never
quite
figured
it
out
because
he
looks
more
like
a
wasp
than
i
do
trump
said
of
cortes
who
was
in
the
audience
from
the
stage
he
asked
cortes
who
do
you
like
more
the
country
or
the
hispanics
cortes
appeared
to
mouth
country
to
which
trump
replied
i
don't
know
i
may
have
to
go
for
the
hispanics
to
be
honest
with
you
we
got
a
lot
of
hispanics
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
trump
later
said
hispanics
should
support
him
and
his
efforts
to
build
a
border
wall
because
they
understand
the
roots
of
the
drug
problem
better
than
other
voters
and
at
the
center
of
america's
drug
crisis
this
is
where
the
hispanics
know
it
better
than
anybody
people
said
oh
the
hispanics
won't
like
a
wall
i
said
i
think
they
are
going
to
love
it
trump
said
you
know
why
because
you
understand
it
better
than
other
people
but
at
the
whole
center
of
this
crisis
is
the
drugs
that
are
pouring
in
and
you
understand
that
when
other
people
don't
understand
it
nobody
loves
the
hispanics
more
trump
told
the
crowd
we
love
our
hispanics
get
out
and
vote
red
white
and
green
latinos
for
trump
signs
littered
the
crowd
with
a
directive
to
text
vamos
to
the
campaign
number
on
the
back
new
mexico's
population
is
nearly
percent
hispanic
according
to
the
census
bureau
trump
was
working
on
his
campaign
insurance
policy
with
the
monday
night
trip
to
new
mexico
making
a
risky
bet
he
could
pick
up
a
state
he
lost
by
points
and
where
republicans
suffered
significant
defeats
in
last
year's
midterm
elections
how
do
i
lose
new
mexico
explain
that
one
trump
asked
the
crowd
as
he
touted
his
support
from
hispanics
trump's
disapproval
rating
among
hispanics
stood
at
percent
in
a
pew
research
center
poll
last
month
republican
campaign
strategists
acknowledge
that
the
president
who
narrowly
won
a
handful
of
swing
states
to
propel
himself
to
the
white
house
needs
to
work
on
a
backup
plan
for
to
win
over
voters
in
states
he
lost
in
an
insurance
policy
should
other
battlegrounds
flip
in
favor
of
his
democratic
opponent
that
has
the
campaign
looking
to
states
like
new
mexico
new
hampshire
nevada
and
minnesota
to
potentially
make
up
the
difference
with
the
extra
time
and
money
they
have
while
democrats
battle
it
out
over
who
their
nominee
will
be
picking
up
those
three
states
for
example
would
offset
the
loss
of
wisconsin
where
polls
show
trump
trailing
in
potential
head-to-head
matchups
during
his
presidency
trump
has
rarely
traveled
to
states
he
didn't
win
though
that
has
been
starting
to
change
he
held
a
rally
in
august
in
new
hampshire
where
he
claimed
without
evidence
that
he
would
have
won
there
had
it
not
been
for
alleged
illegal
voting
in
the
state
it's
a
strategy
that's
less
a
fight
for
available
swing
states
than
a
push
to
turn
tough
terrain
into
battleground
territory
in
the
first
place
for
instance
new
mexico
with
five
electoral
college
votes
hasn't
backed
republican
for
president
since
when
then-president
george
w.
bush
narrowly
edged
out
john
kerry
and
republicans
suffered
significant
losses
in
three
other
states
that
share
a
border
with
mexico
california
texas
and
arizona
as
trump
made
a
migrant
caravan
coming
up
from
mexico
a
central
piece
of
his
closing
arguments
for
the
midterm
election
still
trump
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
maintained
ahead
of
the
president's
visit
that
the
administration's
policies
on
issues
such
as
immigration
and
trade
were
resonating
with
residents
of
this
border
state
and
continued
to
claim
the
campaign
had
data
suggesting
strength
here
and
support
from
latinos
monday's
rally
kicked
off
a
three-day
west
coast
swing
for
the
president
who
planned
to
travel
tuesday
to
california
for
fundraising
events
and
