frustration
with

to
ex-adviser

trump
told
his

that
he
missed

washington
as
president
donald
trump
began
losing
confidence
in
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
whom
he
fired
on
tuesday
he
reached
out
to
the
man
he
had
fired
to
give
bolton
the
job
retired
lt
gen
h.r.
mcmaster
in
phone
calls
to
mcmaster
the
first
of
which
took
place
last
fall
trump
told
his
second
national
security
adviser
that
he
missed
him
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
conversations
it's
a
sentiment
the
president
has
also
expressed
to
white
house
aides
they
said
trump
has
solicited
mcmaster's
advice
on
various
national
security
challenges
even
asking
mcmaster
whom
he
should
nominate
to
lead
the
pentagon
they
said
trump's
contacts
with
mcmaster
perhaps
presaged
his
decision
tuesday
to
unceremoniously
fire
bolton
they
also
were
a
remarkable
shift
for
the
president
that
is
emblematic
of
how
much
bolton
fell
out
of
favor
since
trump
welcomed
him
into
the
white
house
months
ago
at
that
time
trump
was
barely
speaking
to
mcmaster
and
regularly
did
derogatory
impressions
of
him
in
his
absence
according
to
current
and
former
white
house
officials
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
like
bolton
mcmaster's
firing
was
also
hasty
and
announced
publicly
by
the
president
on
twitter
bolton
later
said
he
had
resigned
and
was
not
fired
trump's
patience
for
bolton
ultimately
wore
thin
aides
say
trump
was
close
to
firing
bolton
earlier
this
year
even
putting
his
name
on
a
list
of
officials
he'd
like
to
get
rid
of
before
the
end
of
the
year
after
which
such
moves
might
have
a
negative
effect
on
his
re-election
campaign
officials
said
the
president
was
angered
by
what
he
viewed
as
bolton's
positioning
himself
in
the
news
media
as
the
decision-maker
on
key
issues
like
iran
and
venezuela
the
officials
said
and
it
didn't
help
that
trump
thought
those
policies
weren't
working
trump's
first
national
security
adviser
retired
lt
gen
michael
flynn
was
in
a
virginia
courtroom
tuesday
for
a
hearing
ahead
of
his
sentencing
in
december
flynn
pleaded
guilty
in
december
to
a
charge
of
lying
to
the
fbi
about
his
conversations
with
the
russian
ambassador
in
late
may
or
early
june
bolton
was
told
by
a
white
house
official
that
he
should
steer
clear
of
the
president
keep
a
low
profile
and
let
him
cool
off
amid
tensions
between
the
two
over
policy
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
conversation
the
official
suggested
bolton
travel
more
or
otherwise
find
matters
to
focus
on
that
would
keep
him
away
from
trump
a
spokesman
for
bolton
denied
such
a
conversation
took
place
and
dismissed
the
notion
of
tensions
with
the
president
or
any
other
administration
officials
when
asked
about
the
conversation
one
white
house
official
described
the
talk
as
good
advice
when
trump
is
unsatisfied
with
a
top
aide
he
sometimes
turns
to
that
aide's
predecessor
with
whom
he
was
at
odds
and
had
fired
for
example
trump
began
calling
his
first
chief
of
staff
reince
priebus
when
his
second
one
john
kelly
started
trying
to
get
him
to
do
things
he
didn't
want
to
do
trump's
phone
calls
to
mcmaster
began
in
the
fall
of
about
six
months
after
bolton
had
taken
the
job
the
most
recent
call
that
the
people
familiar
with
the
conversations
knew
of
was
a
few
months
ago
in
another
conversation
in
late
spring
when
trump
was
unsure
about
his
choice
of
then-acting
defense
secretary
patrick
shanahan
to
permanently
hold
the
job
the
president
wanted
to
know
what
mcmaster
thought
he
should
do
at
the
time
trump
was
asking
his
advisers
inside
and
outside
the
white
house
for
alternatives
to
shanahan
and
he
ultimately
switched
to
nominate
mark
esper
who
was
confirmed
by
the
senate
at
least
one
of
trump's
calls
with
mcmaster
focused
on
iran
an
issue
over
which
trump
and
bolton
have
clashed
because
the
president
felt
his
national
security
adviser
was
pushing
him
into
a
military
confrontation
bolton
has
long
been
one
of
the
republican
party's
leading
voices
on
taking
an
aggressive
approach
on
iran
including
advocating
for
regime
change
he
was
instrumental
in
trump's
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
has
advocated
positions
that
have
at
times
put
him
at
odds
with
trump
who
campaigned
on
ending
not
starting
military
conflicts
overseas
mcmaster
declined
to
comment
perhaps
most
detrimental
for
bolton
officials
said
trump
blamed
him
for
a
public
narrative
that
the
national
security
adviser
was
shaping
iran
policy
not
the
president
the
president's
view
is
i
run
iran
john
may
think
he
runs
iran
but
i
run
iran
a
former
white
house
official
said
trump
and
bolton
also
have
differed
over
north
korea
just
weeks
into
his
tenure
bolton
angered
the
president
by
suggesting
a
denuclearization
deal
with
north
korea
could
be
modeled
after
the
one
the
u.s.
had
achieved
with
libya
libya's
leader
muammar
gaddafi
was
killed
eight
years
later
after
the
u.s.
intervened
to
prevent
his
slaughter
of
pro-democracy
demonstrators
the
comparison
of
libya
and
north
korea
by
bolton
who
has
called
for
regime
change
in
pyongyang
didn't
go
over
well
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
whom
trump
was
arranging
to
meet
for
the
first
time
the
president
tried
to
clarify
saying
the
libya
model
isn't
the
model
that
we
have
at
all
when
we're
thinking
of
north
korea
bolton
took
a
far
different
approach
to
the
job
than
mcmaster
did
while
mcmaster
held
meetings
and
ran
a
policy
process
that
involved
meetings
with
officials
from
other
agencies
bolton
opted
to
work
policy
directly
with
the
president
he
hasn't
chaired
a
principals
committee
meeting
at
the
national
security
council
in
months
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
matter
his
strong
opinions
and
tensions
with
trump
have
made
him
increasingly
isolated
in
the
west
wing
with
few
allies
in
the
administration
still
the
president's
outreach
to
mcmaster
surprised
the
people
closest
to
him
he
must
be
getting
pretty
far
down
on
his
call
list
because
mcmaster
is
not
at
the
top
another
former
white
house
official
said
by
the
time
mcmaster
left
the
white
house
it
had
become
an
open
secret
that
trump
had
stopped
having
him
brief
him
because
he
didn't
like
his
style
and
would
cut
him
off
in
meetings
or
exclude
him
altogether
yet
while
the
two
weren't
close
officials
said
the
president
didn't
have
the
sort
of
animosity
toward
mcmaster
that
he'd
developed
for
others
on
his
national
security
team
such
as
former
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
who
had
called
trump
a
moron
i
never
got
the
impression
that
trump
hated
mcmaster
he
just
made
fun
of
him
he
was
the
general
in
the
suits
that
didn't
fit
that
were
off
the
rack
who
didn't
understand
business
the
former
white
house
official
said
he
didn't
take
him
seriously
the
official
added
but
there
never
was
this
sort
of
hostility
like
there
was
with
a
tillerson
a
senior
administration
official
said
that
the
president
supported
bolton's
recent
trip
to
london
for
meetings
with
british
officials
largely
focused
on
the
u.k.
s
plan
to
exit
the
european
union
this
fall
but
as
bolton
began
his
talks
with
officials
there
the
president
called
the
new
prime
minister
boris
johnson
a
move
that
made
clear
who
is
in
charge
