share
this
biden
and
warren
had
a
long
history
of
squabbles
before
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
tonight's
democratic
presidential
debate
will
be
the
first
time
when
frontrunner
joe
biden
will
share
the
same
stage
with
elizabeth
warren
due
to
random
drawings
from
the
two
previous
rounds
of
debates
but
this
isn't
the
first
time
they've
squared
off
in
fact
their
history
goes
back
at
least
years
in
a
new
york
times
op-ed
warren
then
a
harvard
law
professor
blasted
biden
then
a
u.s.
senator
for
supporting
legislation
making
it
harder
for
individuals
to
file
bankruptcy
perhaps
due
to
that
op-ed
and
history
biden
was
cold
with
warren
at
a
feb
senate
judiciary
committee
hearing
over
the
same
bankruptcy
bill
biden
maybe
we
should
i'm
being
deadly
earnest
here
because
you
make
a
very
compelling
and
mildly
demagogic
argument
that
talks
about
what
is
true
all
of
these
things
are
true
and
so
my
question
is
is
it
from
a
philosophic
standpoint
is
it
the
responsibility
of
the
gas
company
and
the
drug
store
and
whoever
else
you
name
to
make
sure
that
these
people
do
not
have
to
make
these
hard
choices
or
is
that
a
responsibility
of
the
government
or
the
people
at
large
and
that's
my
only
question
i'll
ask
and
i'm
asking
you
professor
warren
senator
i
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
the
heart
of
what
the
bankruptcy
bill
or
bankruptcy
in
general
not
this
bill
biden
forget
bankruptcy
i'm
asking
a
larger
question
forget
about
bankruptcy
and
warren
with
these
and
others
i
submit
senator
that
there
are
many
in
the
credit
industry
right
now
who
are
getting
their
bankruptcies
prepaid
that
is
they
have
squeezed
enough
out
of
these
families
in
interest
and
fees
and
payments
that
never
biden
sounds
like
you're
talking
about
usury
rates
then
maybe
that's
what
we
should
talk
about
not
bankruptcy
warren
senator
i'll
be
the
first
invite
me
biden
i
know
you
will
but
let's
call
a
spade
a
spade
your
problem
with
the
credit
card
companies
is
usury
rates
from
your
position
it's
not
about
the
bankruptcy
bill
warren
but
senator
but
if
it's
not
going
to
fix
that
problem
you
can't
take
away
the
last
shred
of
protection
for
these
families
biden
i
got
it
okay
you're
very
good
professor
thank
you
given
that
back-and-forth
over
the
bankruptcy
bill
biden
joked
when
he
swore
in
warren
to
be
a
u.s.
senator
in
jan
you
gave
me
hell
then
as
biden
jumped
into
the
race
back
in
april
warren
said
he
was
on
the
side
of
credit
card
companies
and
last
night
top
biden
surrogate
ed
rendell
accused
warren
of
being
a
hypocrite
for
gladly
accepting
campaign
donations
from
wealthy
donors
like
him
in
past
cycles
but
criticizing
biden
from
doing
it
now
so
as
biden
and
warren
finally
go
toe-to-toe
tonight
there's
plenty
of
current
and
past
disagreements
for
the
debate
moderators

among

was
year-old

making
his
first
run

other

included
michael
