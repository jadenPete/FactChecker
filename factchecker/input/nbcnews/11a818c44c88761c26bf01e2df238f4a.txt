share
this
democratic
debate
fact-check
candidates
take
the
stage
in
houston
here's
what
the
candidates
said
that
was
true
less
than
true
and
flat-out
false
for
the
first
time
the
democratic
presidential
debate
field
was
culled
to
just
qualifiers
meaning
they
competed
on
a
single
stage
on
the
same
night
in
houston
thursday
voters
finally
got
the
chance
to
see
front-runners
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
and
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
face
off
against
one
another
and
we
fact-checked
all
the
candidates
statements
in
real
time
see
all
the
claims
and
the
facts
below
at
one
point
sanders
claimed
we
have
the
highest
child
poverty
rate
of
almost
any
country
on
earth
this
is
hyperbole
there
are
numerous
less-developed
nations
with
higher
child
poverty
rates
america's
child
poverty
rate
is
above
the
organisation
for
economic
co-operation
and
development
average
but
a
slew
of
other
countries
have
even
higher
child
poverty
rates
including
russia
spain
india
israel
brazil
and
china
pete
buttigieg
told
a
story
about
a
japanese
exchange
student
in
indiana
who
returned
to
her
home
country
and
after
failing
to
pass
a
teacher's
exam
became
a
doctor
seeming
to
imply
that
teachers
in
japan
are
compensated
on
par
with
those
in
the
medical
profession
she
took
the
exam
to
try
to
become
a
teacher
in
a
society
that
really
regards
teachers
and
compensates
teachers
well
and
she
came
up
just
short
so
you
know
what
she
did
since
she
was
academically
good
but
couldn't
quite
make
the
cut
to
be
a
teacher
she
had
a
fall-back
plan
she
became
a
doctor
that
is
how
seriously
some
countries
treat
the
teaching
profession
if
we
want
to
get
the
results
that
we
expect
for
our
children
we
have
to
support
and
compensate
the
teaching
profession
respect
teachers
the
way
we
do
soldiers
and
pay
them
more
like
the
way
we
do
doctors
buttigieg
said
according
to
data
from
the
intergovernmental
organisation
for
economic
co-operation
and
development
oecd
american
teachers
are
actually
paid
better
than
japanese
teachers
primary
school
teachers
in
japan
with
years
experience
make
approximately
usd
a
year
american
primary
school
teachers
with
the
same
level
of
experience
make
approximately
a
year
luxembourg
might
have
been
a
better
example
teachers
at
this
level
make
a
year
elizabeth
warren
in
defending
her
campaign
position
that
she
would
roll
back
the
legislative
filibuster
a
move
that
would
allow
senate
bills
to
advance
to
a
full
vote
with
a
simple
majority
instead
of
the
the
modern
filibuster
requires
to
end
debate
on
a
bill
and
move
on
to
the
vote
made
the
claim
that
we're
not
going
to
get
anything
done
on
guns
without
her
proposed
rollback
i
was
in
the
united
states
senate
when
senators
said
let's
do
background
checks
let's
get
rid
of
assault
weapons
and
with
senators
it
failed
because
of
the
filibuster
she
said
this
isn't
exactly
true
warren
appears
to
be
conflating
two
separate
votes
in
following
the
december
newtown
connecticut
massacre
at
sandy
hook
elementary
school
the
senate
held
several
votes
on
gun
control
bills
at
the
time
democrats
as
well
as
independents
that
aligned
with
democrats
controlled
seats
in
the
senate
one
vote
was
for
a
bill
to
expand
and
strengthen
background
checks
on
gun
sales
another
vote
was
for
a
bill
to
ban
assault
weapons
both
failed
the
so-called
manchin-toomey
compromise
on
background
checks
failed
meaning
it
could
have
passed
a
filibuster-free
senate
as
warren
claimed
thursday
but
only
senators
voted
for
the
assault
weapons
ban
it
failed
meaning
a
filibuster-free
senate
could
have
not
saved
it
over
percent
of
the
american
people
think
we
have
to
get
assault
weapons
off
the
street
period
and
we
have
to
get
buybacks
and
get
them
out
of
their
basements
biden
said
during
thursday
night's
debate
this
is
an
exaggeration
americans
tend
to
support
banning
the
sale
of
assault
rifles
but
mandatory
buybacks
are
another
question
according
to
a
politico
morning
consult
poll
conducted
last
month
percent
of
americans
said
they
support
banning
assault-style
weapons
a
monmouth
university
survey
this
month
found
that
percent
of
americans
approve
of
a
ban
on
assault
rifles
but
support
falls
dramatically
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
the
guns
they
already
own
just
percent
of
respondents
supported
a
mandatory
buyback
program
in
the
monmouth
survey
and
when
gallup
asked
in
if
respondents
would
be
for
or
against
a
law
making
it
illegal
to
manufacture
sell
or
possess
semi-automatic
guns
known
as
assault
rifles
just
percent
of
respondents
said
they
favored
such
a
law
there's
over
jurisdictions
in
america
where
children
have
more
than
twice
the
blood
lead
levels
than
flint
michigan
booker
said
this
is
accurate
according
to
studies
published
in
the
past
few
years
a
analysis
by
reuters
of
lead
testing
results
across
the
u.s.
found
almost
neighborhoods
with
lead
poisoning
rates
in
children
at
least
double
of
those
in
flint
reuters
continued
conducting
their
analysis
into
and
an
updated
study
published
that
year
found
that
the
number
had
increased
to
more
than
the
majority
of
homicide
victims
come
from
neighborhoods
like
mine
booker
said
referencing
his
newark
new
jersey
home
during
a
discussion
on
gun
violence
this
is
true
according
to
data
from
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
from
percent
of
firearm
homicides
occurred
in
a
metropolitan
area
right
now
million
americans
don't
have
coverage
harris
said
of
the
state
of
health
care
in
the
u.s.
thursday
night
this
is
mostly
true
the
census
bureau
released
data
this
week
that
found
that
million
people
were
uninsured
for
all
of
while
another
million
reported
they
had
health
care
for
less
than
the
entire
year
the
number
of
uninsured
americans
rose
from
sanders
said
the
effects
of
nafta
combined
with
the
effects
of
granting
permanent
normal
trade
relations
status
to
china
often
referred
to
as
pntr
cost
the
u.s.
million
jobs
joe
and
i
strongly
disagree
on
trade
i
helped
lead
the
opposition
the
nafta
the
pntr
which
cost
this
country
over
million
good-paying
jobs
sanders
said
of
biden's
views
this
appears
to
be
true
according
to
several
reputable
analyses
as
nbc
news
carrie
dann
reported
in
february
during
president
donald
trump's
state
of
the
union
address
job
losses
resulting
from
nafta
tend
to
be
overstated
but
one
major
study
found
that
more
than
jobs
were
displaced
by
the
pact
robert
e.
scott
of
the
pro-labor
economic
policy
institute
found
that
about
u.s.
jobs
were
displaced
by
the
u.s.
trade
deficit
with
mexico
between
shortly
before
nafta
was
implemented
and
that's
a
data
point
that
was
cited
by
sanders
during
his
campaign
when
he
frequently
decried
job
losses
due
to
nafta
other
studies
however
have
found
the
job
losses
to
be
far
less
when
it
comes
to
granting
pntr
status
to
china
which
president
george
w.
bush
formally
granted
in
after
china
entered
the
world
trade
organization
u.s.
job
losses
have
been
larger
according
to
studies
the
nonpartisan
congressional
research
service
wrote
in
citing
a
study
by
the
economic
policy
institute
that
growth
in
the
u.s.
goods
trade
deficit
with
china
between
and
eliminated
or
displaced
million
u.s.
jobs
three-fourths
of
which
were
in
manufacturing
if
you
add
the
figure
with
the
million
figure
you
would
see
a
figure
that
approximates
the
million
figure
that
sanders
referred
to
thursday
night
let
us
be
clear
joe
in
the
united
states
of
america
we
are
spending
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
health
care
as
the
canadians
and
any
other
major
country
on
earth
sanders
said
on
thursday
overall
this
claim
is
exaggerated
the
u.s.
actually
spent
more
than
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
health
care
as
canada
but
the
nation
isn't
spending
twice
as
much
as
any
other
major
country
on
earth
the
u.s.
spends
per
capita
on
health
care
according
to
data
from
the
intergovernmental
organization
for
economic
co-operation
and
development
oecd
it's
twice
as
much
or
more
per
capita
on
health
care
as
many
other
countries
but
not
all
of
them
switzerland
for
instance
pays
per
capita
the
u.s.
also
far
outspends
countries
like
russia
which
spends
on
health
care
per
capita
comparing
obama
to
the
president
we
have
is
outrageous
number
one
we
didn't
lock
people
up
in
cages
we
didn't
separate
families
we
didn't
do
all
of
those
things
biden
said
defending
the
obama
administration's
record
on
immigration
after
a
question
about
deportations
biden
is
half
right
the
obama
administration
did
detain
people
in
cage-like
structures
earning
criticism
from
activists
last
year
democratic
activists
circulated
photos
of
children
inside
chain
link
fenced
spaces
in
an
attack
on
president
donald
trump
only
for
onlookers
to
later
realize
the
photos
were
from
biden
is
correct
to
say
that
the
obama
administration
did
not
separate
families
as
a
policy
the
obama
administration
detained
whole
families
together
while
the
trump
administration
made
it
a
policy
last
year
to
detain
children
including
babies
and
toddlers
without
their
parents
leaving
other
children
to
tend
to
them
and
sometimes
losing
track
of
their
parents
the
problem
with
your
plan
is
that
it
leaves
million
people
uncovered
juli
n
castro
said
during
thursday's
debate
criticizing
biden's
health
care
proposal
this
is
mostly
true
according
to
the
text
of
biden's
own
plan
his
plan
estimates
that
his
expansion
of
the
affordable
care
act
would
insure
more
than
an
estimated
percent
of
americans
there's
an
estimated
million
people
living
in
america
percent
of
the
population
is
approximately
million
estimates
on
the
number
of
non-citizens
vary
and
it's
unclear
how
biden's
proposal
would
affect
immigrant
communities
in
practice
which
could
change
these
numbers
still
biden
has
said
he
wants
to
give
everyone
a
chance
to
be
covered
klobuchar
poked
at
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
for
inaction
on
gun
control
measures
saying
that
the
kentucky
republican
has
three
bills
on
his
desk
right
now
universal
background
checks
closing
the
charleston
loophole
and
passing
my
bill
to
make
sure
domestic
abusers
don't
get
ak-
s
this
is
true
but
all
three
bills
face
an
unclear
if
not
flat-out
bleak
fate
in
the
gop-controlled
senate
in
february
the
democratic-controlled
house
passed
a
law
closing
the
so-called
charleston
loophole
which
allows
the
sale
of
a
firearm
to
proceed
if
a
background
check
is
not
completed
within
three
days
it's
a
loophole
that
allowed
dylann
roof
to
obtain
his
weapon
with
which
he
murdered
nine
people
at
the
emanuel
ame
church
in
charleston
south
carolina
in
in
march
the
house
passed
a
bill
that
would
expand
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
to
include
buys
made
at
gun
shows
online
and
other
private
sales
and
in
april
the
house
voted
to
reauthorize
the
violence
against
women
act
with
new
language
that
would
close
the
so-called
boyfriend
loophole
under
current
law
it
is
illegal
for
spouses
or
ex-spouses
who
have
been
convicted
of
abuse
or
who
are
under
a
restraining
order
to
buy
a
gun
but
the
law
doesn't
apply
to
romantic
partners
who
aren't
legally
married
booker
talking
about
a
savagely
broken
criminal
justice
system
said
african
americans
are
almost
four
times
more
likely
to
be
incarcerated
than
other
americans
he's
right
in
fact
it's
more
than
four
times
when
it
comes
to
white
americans
according
to
the
naacp
african
americans
are
incarcerated
more
than
five
times
the
rate
of
whites
and
according
to
a
analysis
by
the
sentencing
project
a
criminal
justice
nonprofit
and
research
group
african
americans
are
times
as
likely
to
be
incarcerated
than
whites
drawing
a
contrast
between
his
health
care
plan
and
sanders
medicare
for
all
plan
biden
said
my
plan
for
health
care
costs
billion
dollars
it
doesn't
cost
trillion
dollars
trillion
a
year
turns
out
is
twice
what
the
entire
federal
budget
is
that's
before
it
exists
now
without
interest
on
the
debt
biden's
math
is
off
while
medicare
for
all
could
cost
trillion
a
year
according
to
one
estimate
the
federal
budget
is
larger
in
the
federal
budget
was
trillion
including
billion
going
toward
interest
additionally
biden's
campaign
estimates
the
cost
of
the
candidate's
plan
at
billion
over
a
decade
while
estimates
have
put
the
cost
of
sanders
plan
at
trillion
or
more
over
a
decade
sanders
amid
a
contentious
back-and-forth
about
medicare
for
all
with
biden
and
warren
said
that
every
study
done
shows
that
medicare
for
all
is
the
most
cost-effective
approach
for
providing
health
care
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
this
country
this
isn't
true
a
handful
of
studies
do
show
sanders
plan
to
be
a
more
cost-effective
alternative
to
the
current
system
but
even
more
indicate
the
opposite
sanders
medicare
for
all
plan
would
insure
an
additional
million
people
so
it'd
be
a
huge
selling
point
if
it
was
also
cheaper
than
the
current
system
but
of
five
major
medicare
for
all
studies
reviewed
in
detail
by
the
new
york
times
just
two
found
overall
health
care
expenditures
would
be
lower
than
current
costs
and
what's
more
there
are
sizable
variables
that
could
affect
the
math
should
his
plan
be
implemented
