checks
the
white
house
stressed
that
president

had
yet
set
to
settle
on
any
formal
position
or
proposal
on
guns
as
talks
with
congress
continued
wednesday
a
justice
department
proposal
being
circulated
on
capitol
hill
would
expand

include
all
gun
show
sales
and
create
a
system
for
sellers
who
aren't
licensed
dealers
to
complete
the
background
check
process
the
proposal
which
has
not
been
endorsed
by
president
donald
trump
is
similar
to
the
failed
manchin-toomey
background
checks
bill
from
and
would
apply
to
all
commercial
sales
including
sales
at
gun
shows
according
to
a
copy
of
talking
points
obtained
by
nbc
news
attorney
general
william
barr
and
white
house
director
of
legislative
affairs
eric
ueland
are
meeting
with
republican
senators
this
week
to
discuss
the
way
forward
on
gun
legislation
including
this
proposal
and
others
the
white
house
is
still
searching
for
some
legislation
either
new
or
existing
that
could
get
the
necessary
support
from
democrats
and
republicans
in
order
to
pass
the
senate
a
justice
department
official
confirmed
the
agency
had
drafted
the
background
check
proposal
the
president
has
not
signed
off
on
anything
yet
but
has
been
clear
he
wants
meaningful
solutions
that
actually
protect
the
american
people
and
could
potentially
prevent
these
tragedies
from
ever
happening
again
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
who
emphasized
the
document
wasn't
from
the
white
house
said
in
a
statement
a
senior
administration
official
described
the
meetings
as
an
effort
to
hear
from
senators
and
get
their
reaction
to
various
ideas
saying
this
proposal
was
pulled
together
by
the
department
of
justice
in
response
to
previous
conversations
about
various
commercial
background
check
concepts
ueland
told
reporters
that
he
and
barr
were
on
capitol
hill
seeking
general
lawmaker
input
on
the
issue
the
president
has
asked
us
to
come
to
the
hill
to
engage
in
conversations
and
seek
feedback
from
members
on
the
question
of
what
ideas
they
have
and
reactions
to
policy
ideas
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
gun
violence
he
said
that's
what
we're
up
here
today
working
on
barr
also
said
officials
were
meeting
with
members
to
solicit
thoughts
not
relay
information
or
any
presidential
plans
i'm
up
here
just
kicking
around
some
ideas
getting
perspectives
so
i
can
be
in
a
better
position
to
advise
the
president
but
the
president
has
made
no
decision
yet
on
these
issues
he
said
barr
and
ueland
were
expected
to
continue
their
meetings
on
capitol
hill
this
week
under
the
proposal
a
gun
seller
who
isn't
a
licensed
firearms
dealer
would
be
required
to
conduct
a
background
check
through
either
an
existing
firearms
dealer
or
a
newly
created
entity
called
a
licensed
transfer
agent
which
would
be
authorized
to
initiate
checks
for
private
sellers
the
doj
plan
seeks
to
address
concerns
by
gun-rights
advocates
that
background
checks
could
create
a
paper
trail
that
would
eventually
lead
to
a
national
gun
registry
in
a
one-page
summary
of
the
proposal
it
says
sellers
would
be
responsible
for
keeping
a
record
of
the
sale
with
the
buyer's
information
but
only
the
seller
would
retain
that
information
the
only
documentation
reflecting
the
identity
of
the
buyer
would
be
the
bill
of
sale
in
the
custody
of
the
seller
the
proposal
says
sen
josh
hawley
r-mo
who
met
with
barr
and
ueland
in
his
office
in
the
russell
senate
office
building
on
tuesday
said
that
barr
was
not
really
trying
to
sell
him
on
the
proposal
but
presenting
it
as
an
idea
they
were
working
on
hawley
said
he
had
concerns
about
the
original
manchin-toomey
bill
something
that
barr
tried
to
address
i
am
concerned
about
anything
that
creates
anything
that
gets
us
along
down
the
road
towards
a
national
registry
that
has
been
a
long
standing
concerns
of
what
manchin-toomey
is
trying
to
do
or
the
kind
of
proposal
manchin-toomey
embraces
hawley
told
reporters
wednesday
i
think
the
attorney
general's
proposal
was
an
attempt
to
address
some
of
those
concerns
frankly
which
i
think
is
interesting
and
helpful
so
maybe
there's
some
compromise
sen
joe
manchin
d-w
va
said
he
had
seen
the
document
but
had
yet
to
meet
with
barr
on
it
though
he
expected
to
have
that
discussion
soon
it's
just
an
outline
of
what
they're
trying
to
do
manchin
told
reporters
these
are
just
outlines
at
least
the
republicans
are
still
engaged
and
talking
and
that's
very
very
hopeful
for
me
but
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
who
has
spearheaded
democratic
outreach
to
the
white
house
on
gun
legislation
expressed
skepticism
it
reflects
some
of
the
discussions
we
have
been
having
but
there
are
also
some
new
ideas
that
may
not
be
great
ideas
murphy
said
of
the
document
murphy
would
not
say
which
ideas
he
was
referring
to
i'm
not
sure
the
utility
of
shopping
a
proposal
with
republicans
that
the
president
may
not
support
murphy
said
that's
an
odd
way
to
go
about
trying
to
get
consensus
is
leaving
the
question
of
the
president's
position
open
republicans
said
the
administration
visits
could
help
advance
the
process
my
impression
is
that
the
white
house
is
still
mulling
things
over
and
they're
doing
a
lot
of
listening
sen
john
kennedy
r-la
said
after
his
meeting
with
barr
wednesday
i
think
the
white
house
is
smart
to
send
the
attorney
general
the
attorney
general
has
a
lot
of
credibility
over
here
and
i
think
he's
a
good
person
to
look
at
this
in
a
cool
and
dispassionate
way
the
hurdle
said
sen
john
cornyn
r-texas
lay
in
the
movement
from
theory
to
execution
there
are
a
lot
of
good
ideas
there
the
challenge
is
too
many
ideas
and
not
enough
consensus
he
said
so
that's
what
our
job
is
now
is
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
build
consensus
cornyn
said
a
decision
from
trump
would
help
a
lot
the
meetings
could
go
on
forever
he
said
