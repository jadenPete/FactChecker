unusal
statement
from

minutes
before
the

video
mocking
cnn
about
the
bizarre
alabama
controversy
as
hurricane
dorian
lashed
the
east
coast
on
friday
president
donald
trump
tweeted
four
times
about
sharpie-gate
while
the
government
agency
in
charge
of
weather
forecasting
took
a
swipe
at
its
own
weather
service
in
a
bid
to
bolster
trump's
claims
that
alabama
could
have
been
affected
in
an
unsigned
statement
released
early
friday
evening
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
said
that
information
it
provided
from
aug
through
monday
to
trump
and
the
public
demonstrated
that
tropical-storm-force
winds
from
hurricane
dorian
could
impact
alabama
and
noaa
which
is
in
charge
of
the
national
weather
service
also
chided
the
nws
in
birmingham
alabama
for
tweeting
on
sunday
after
the
president's
claim
that
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
we
repeat
no
impacts
from
hurricane
dorian
will
be
felt
across
alabama
the
system
will
remain
too
far
east
in
its
unusual
statement
friday
noaa
said
the
birmingham
office
spoke
in
absolute
terms
that
were
inconsistent
with
probabilities
from
the
best
forecast
products
available
at
the
time
dan
sobien
president
of
the
national
weather
service
employees
organization
the
union
that
represents
nws
forecasters
ripped
the
noaa
statement
in
a
tweet
friday
evening
let
me
assure
you
the
hard
working
employees
of
the
nws
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
utterly
disgusting
and
disingenuous
tweet
sent
out
by
noaa
management
tonight
he
tweeted
minutes
after
the
noaa
statement
was
released
trump
tweeted
an
edited
cnn
clip
from
wednesday
aug
warning
that
alabama
could
feel
dorian's
effects
he
also
tweeted
three
times
about
coverage
of
his
warning
on
friday
morning
around
the
same
time
dorian
made
landfall
in
north
carolina
buffeting
cape
hatteras
with
mph
winds
and
knocking
out
power
to
households
the
fake
news
media
was
fixated
on
the
fact
that
i
properly
said
at
the
beginnings
of
hurricane
dorian
that
in
addition
to
florida
other
states
alabama
may
also
be
grazed
or
hit
they
went
crazy
hoping
against
hope
that
i
made
a
mistake
which
i
didn't
trump
wrote
in
the
first
of
the
tweets
trump's
insistence
that
he
didn't
make
a
mistake
with
his
alabama
warning
has
become
known
as
sharpie-gate
after
he
held
up
a
map
in
the
oval
office
during
a
hurricane
briefing
earlier
this
week
that
looked
like
it
had
been
altered
with
the
black
pen
to
include
alabama
in
the
area
of
danger
the
president
has
continued
to
complain
about
the
coverage
in
the
days
since
on
thursday
the
white
house
issued
a
statement
from
a
homeland
security
adviser
who
said
that
trump
had
been
briefed
sunday
on
the
possibility
of
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
southeastern
alabama
his
campaign
has
embraced
the
bizarre
controversy
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
tweeted
out
a
link
earlier
in
the
day
for
supporters
to
buy
sets
of
official
trump
sharpie-style
pens
buy
the
official
trump
marker
which
is
different
than
every
other
marker
on
the
market
because
this
one
has
the
special
ability
to
drive
cnn
and
the
rest
of
the
fake
news
crazy
