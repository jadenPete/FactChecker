share
this
why
trump's
storm
over
alabama
was
the
hurricane's
most
predictable
pattern
analysis
the
president's
use
of
false
or
misleading
evidence
to
back
up
inaccurate
claims

than
back
down

had

washington
the
precise
path
of
hurricane
dorian
may
have
been
uncertain
for
much
of
the
week
but
president
donald
trump's
decision
to
highlight
rather
than
retreat
from
his
early
forecast
misstatement
was
entirely
predictable
a
weather
map
doctored
to
fit
trump's
false
assertion
that
a
hurricane
had
been
heading
toward
alabama
was
the
latest
attempt
by
the
president
or
the
white
house
to
create
misleading
evidence
to
support
his
version
of
events
while
trump
routinely
makes
false
statements
sometimes
dozens
a
week
his
administration
has
repeatedly
gone
even
further
by
creating
evidence
to
support
the
president's
alternative
reality
in
some
cases
marshaling
government
resources
in
the
task
it's
been
the
pattern
since
the
first
day
of
his
administration
when
he
sent
out
his
press
secretary
to
show
edited
photos
inflating
his
inaugural
crowd
size
or
a
few
months
later
when
he
created
a
commission
to
search
for
evidence
of
widespread
voter
fraud
after
falsely
claiming
there
were
millions
of
illegal
votes
in
the
commission
was
quickly
dissolved
or
in
between
when
he
asked
congress
to
investigate
a
baseless
allegation
that
his
predecessor
barack
obama
had
wiretapped
his
phones
at
trump
tower
the
president
has
repeatedly
dug
in
claiming
the
right
to
his
own
personal
preference
on
otherwise
uncooperative
reality
on
everything
from
wind
direction
to
the
progress
of
his
top
policy
priority
after
he
was
unable
to
get
new
wall
funding
from
congress
trump
tweeted
out
photos
that
he
suggested
depicted
the
debut
of
his
border
wall
with
mexico
but
actually
showed
the
replacement
of
the
existing
s-era
barrier
trump's
false
statements
on
everything
from
the
economy
to
windmills
have
been
well-documented
but
his
team
sometimes
caught
off-guard
initially
has
generally
scrambled
to
back
him
up
with
white
house
counselor
kellyanne
conway
famously
describing
the
inauguration
claims
as
alternative
facts
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
they
have
also
employed
some
of
the
same
tactics
to
boost
their
version
of
events
as
when
then-press
secretary
sarah
sanders
tweeted
out
a
video
of
cnn
reporter
jim
acosta
refusing
to
turn
over
the
microphone
to
a
white
house
intern
during
a
news
conference
that
had
been
altered
by
a
right-wing
commentator
in
a
way
that
exaggerated
the
exchange
trump
has
also
shared
misleading
videos
made
by
third
parties
as
false
evidence
to
back
his
claims
the
president's
own
use
of
false
or
misleading
evidence
to
back
up
inaccurate
claims
rather
than
back
down
from
them
has
had
the
effect
of
super-charging
his
falsehoods
creating
entire
news
cycles
of
their
own
often
personally
reviving
stories
in
a
bid
for
vindication
just
when
a
news
storm
had
seemingly
passed
three
days
after
trump
was
criticized
for
warning
alabama
residents
that
they
could
be
affected
by
a
storm
that
wasn't
on
track
to
hit
the
state
he
displayed
an
apparently
doctored
map
in
the
oval
office
on
wednesday
to
support
his
inaccurate
claim
the
map
trump
displayed
was
the
same
as
a
model
produced
by
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
last
week
showing
the
hurricane's
projected
path
cutting
through
central
florida
but
where
the
original
projection
ended
a
smaller
black
circle
drawn
in
black
sharpie
was
added
to
include
a
small
part
of
alabama
in
the
model
hours
later
trump
tweeted
another
map
dated
four
days
before
his
alabama
comments
that
showed
a
small
number
of
projected
routes
for
the
storm
that
could
take
it
through
parts
of
alabama
but
the
image
credited
to
a
local
agency
called
the
south
florida
water
management
district
includes
fine
print
that
says
nhs
advisories
and
county
emergency
management
statements
supersede
this
project
this
graphic
should
complement
not
replace
nhc
discussions
and
if
anything
on
this
graphic
causes
confusion
ignore
the
entire
product
nonetheless
trump
tweeted
the
image
again
demanding
an
apology
from
the
media
for
pointing
out
his
original
misstatement
followed
by
a
series
of
other
images
that
showed
early
projections
for
tropical
storm
force
winds
in
alabama
but
those
models
had
been
out
of
date
by
sunday
when
trump
tweeted
that
alabama
could
be
hit
while
the
doctored
map
might
not
have
convinced
anyone
trump
was
correct
in
his
assertion
it
was
effective
in
getting
himself
in
the
news
during
a
period
when
most
media
coverage
would
be
focused
on
the
storm
for
a
president
whose
career
has
been
dedicated
to
the
motto
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bad
publicity
trump
shows
no
signs
of
wanting
the
media
storm
to
dissipate
spending
a
fifth
day
on
thursday
repeatedly
tweeting
his
defense
and
calling
fox
news
reporter
john
roberts
into
the
oval
office
to
make
his
case
and
he
retweeted
a
storm
readiness
message
from
the
alabama
national
guard
one
from
before
labor
day
weekend
i
was
with
you
all
the
way
alabama
the
fake
news
media
was
not
he
said
on
friday
he
launched
another
tweetstorm
slamming
coverage
of
his
storm
track
misstatement
accusing
reporters
of
going
crazy
hoping
against
hope
that
i
made
a
mistake
which
i
didn't
even
as
hurricane
dorian
finally
weakened
the
clouds
inside
the
oval
office
only
darkened
and
with
his
map
a
fresh
flood
of
defiant
tweets
and
his
staff's
support
trump
spent
days
making
a
hurricane
story
about
himself
positioning
himself
as
a
victim
at
the
center
of
the
week's
main
news
event
