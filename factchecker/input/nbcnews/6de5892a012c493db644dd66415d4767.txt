huge
for
families
the
entrepreneur
who'd
vowed
to
do
something
never
before
seen
on
a
debate
stage
went
full
oprah
promising
to
pay
a
month
to
random
american
families
for
a
year
i'm
going
to
do
something
unprecedented
tonight
yang
said
my
campaign
is
now
going
to
give
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
to
american
families
for
an
entire
year
someone
watching
this
at
home
right
now
the
recipient
will
be
chosen
in
an
online
raffle
it's
original
i'll
give
you
that
said
the
next
candidate
to
speak
after
yang's
opening
statement
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
freedom
dividends
are
the
linchpin
of
yang's
surprising
campaign
he's
proposing
that
the
government
should
pay
every
american
over
the
age
of
a
no-string-attached
a
month
yang
has
been
paying
the
dividend
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
three
families
one
in
new
hampshire
one
in
iowa
and
one
in
florida
his
campaignsaid
the
new
payments
would
come
from
his
campaign
funds
the
campaign
is
excited
to
work
together
with
our
supporters
to
help
create
more
stories
about
what
the
freedom
dividend
means
for
american
families
it
will
enable
and
empower
citizens
to
pay
their
bills
switch
jobs
take
care
of
loved
ones
and
plan
for
the
future
said
campaign
manager
zach
graumann
as
inventive
as
the
pitch
may
be
it's
not
clear
the
raffle
is
legal
under
campaign
finance
law
campaign
funds
can't
be
used
to
pay
for
any
expenses
to
fulfill
a
commitment
obligation
or
expense
of
any
person
that
would
exist
irrespective
of
the
candidate's
campaign
or
responsibilities
as
a
federal
officeholder
according
to
the
federal
election
commission
yang's
campaign
could
argue
that
this
passes
legal
muster
because
the
raffle
is
a
part
of
his
campaign
and
the
campaign
said
in
a
statement
that
its
lawyers
have
declared
the
raffle
fully
compliant
with
all
fec
regulations
but
some
campaign
finance
experts
have
thrown
cold
water
on
that
reading
if
it's
just
given
for
no
work
done
for
nothing
at
all
just
a
gift
that
is
inappropriate
ann
ravel
a
former
federal
election
commission
chief
told
time
you
can't
just
give
cash
election
law
expert
rick
hasen
had
a
different
take
i
don't
see
a
legal
problem
so
long
as
it
is
not
tied
to
voting
or
registering
he
tweeted
yang
had
been
teasing
the
announcement
in
recent
days
tweeting
on
tuesday
that
he
had
something
big
in
store
for
the
houston
debate
he
then
made
several
jokes
about
what
that
would
be
for
those
wondering
i
will
be
crowdsurfing
in
sandals
at
thursday's
debate
