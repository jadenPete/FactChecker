share
this
what
we
know
and
don't
know
about
the
trump-whistleblower
story
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
the
political
scandal
of
was
the
trump
campaign
gladly
accepting
assistance
from
russia's
interference
in
the
election
to
hurt
hillary
clinton's
candidacy
is
the
political
scandal
of
one
day
after
robert
mueller's
july
testimony
on
capitol
hill
president
trump's
phone
conversation
with
ukraine's
new
president
in
which
trump
allegedly
tied
together
foreign
aid
and
investigating
joe
biden's
family
here's
what
we
do
know
here's
what
we
don't
know
if
this
is
what
this
looks
like
and
again
we
don't
know
the
actual
substance
of
the
july
call
then
it's
arguably
worse
than
watergate
when
the
dirty
tricks
were
being
conducted
by
americans
against
americans
but
this
time
is
the
dirty
trick
a
sitting
president
dangling
aid
to
a
foreign
country
to
get
it
to
investigate
a
rival
campaign
we
learned
from
that
the
trump
campaign
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
win
do
national
democrats
who
believe
defeating
trump
in
not
impeaching
him
is
the
best
way
to
remove
him
from
office
understand
what
else
we
might
see
over
the
next
months
at
a
m
et
from
the
white
house
president
trump
will
have
a
joint
press
availability
with
australia's
prime
minister
so
trump
will
get
asked
about
this
