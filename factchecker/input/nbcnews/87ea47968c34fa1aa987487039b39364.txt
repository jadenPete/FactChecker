this
in
the

apple
a
big
contrast
between
two
campaigns
first
read
is
your
briefing
from
meet
the
press
and
the
nbc
political
unit
on
the
day's
most
important
political
stories
and
why
they
matter
washington
last
night
was
a
tale
of
two
different
democratic
presidential
campaigns
in
new
york
city
one
kamala
harris
was
raising
money
appearing
on
msnbc's
rachel
maddow
as
well
as
with
jimmy
fallon
the
other
elizabeth
warren's
turned
out
new
yorkers
in
washington
square
park
nine
months
ago
when
the
dem
race
just
started
it
was
unclear
who
was
going
to
leave
the
largest
mark
between
these
two
female
candidates
and
it
was
just
nine
months
ago
when
harris
turned
out
for
her
launch
in
oakland
how
things
have
changed
by
the
way
while
warren
joe
biden
and
bernie
sanders
all
hit
the
campaign
trail
right
after
debate
night
in
houston
voters
won't
see
kamala
harris
at
a
public
event
until
this
thursday
in
iowa
per
nbc's
vaughn
hillyard
and
deepa
shivaram
the
last
time
harris
held
a
public
event
was
sept
in
new
hampshire
where
she
attended
the
votevets
forum
ahead
of
the
state
convention
so
that'll
be
days
off
the
trail
for
her
when
it
comes
to
public
events
instead
harris
is
spending
the
week
on
a
fundraising
swing
through
the
east
coast
holding
events
in
new
york
connecticut
and
baltimore
as
the
third
quarter
fundraising
deadline
approaches
on
sept
harris
faces
pressure
to
haul
in
big
numbers
especially
after
bringing
in
just
million
in
the
last
quarter
but
the
last
time
harris
has
been
to
iowa
try
aug
hillyard

israelis
vote
tuesday
in
an
unprecedented
repeat
election
that
will
decide
whether
longtime
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
stays
in
power
despite
a
looming
indictment
on
corruption
charges
the
ap
writes
netanyahu
the
longest
serving
leader
in
israeli
history
is
seeking
a
fourth
consecutive
term
in
office
and
fifth
overall
but
he
faces
a
stiff
challenge
from
retired
military
chief
benny
gantz
whose
centrist
blue
and
white
party
is
running
even
with
netanyahu's
likud
if
you're
thinking
that
israel
just
had
an
election
you're
not
wrong
netanyahu
and
gantz
faced
off
back
in
april
but
avigdor
lieberman
his
mercurial
ally-turned-rival
refused
to
join
the
new
coalition
citing
excessive
influence
it
granted
the
ultra-orthodox
jewish
parties
the
ap
adds
without
a
parliamentary
majority
netanyahu
dissolved
parliament
and
called
a
new
election

friendly
ribbing

one
thing
a
comes
before
b.
buttigieg
spent
his
time
going
after
president
trump
per
sotomayor
and
jackson
he
ridiculed
trump
for
thinking
he
can
change
the
weather
by
taking
out
a
sharpie
and
rewriting
the
map
he
also
talked
about
how
trump
will
never
build
the
physical
border
wall
but
has
managed
to
build
metaphorical
walls
between
americans
biden
was
the
only
candidate
to
noticeably
read
from
his
notes
but
in
doing
so
he
managed
to
deliver
his
stump
speech
succinctly
and
passionately
biden
then
said
his
campaign
isn't
just
a
campaign
to
beat
donald
trump

this
has
to
be
a
movement
rounded
in
the
values
and
ideals
that
define
this
nation
at
its
best

blasio
