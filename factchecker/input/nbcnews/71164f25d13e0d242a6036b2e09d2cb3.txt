used
his
speech
at
the
united
nations

foreign
policy
agenda
and
urged
his
fellow
heads
of
state
to
follow
suit

them

put
the

of

trump
continued
the
future
does
not

to
globalists
the
future
belong
to
patriots
he
added
that
globalism
had
exerted
a
religious
pull
over
past
leaders
causing
them
to
ignore
their
own
national
interests
but
as
far
as
america
is
concerned
he
said
those
days
are
over
running
through
a
laundry
list
of
topics
that
frequently
appear
in
his
campaign
speeches
trump
touted
the
u.s.
economy
claiming
that
his
pro-growth
agenda
had
resulted
in
historically
low
unemployment
and
blasted
open
borders
and
those
who
advocate
for
them
your
policies
are
not
just
your
policies
are
cruel
and
evil
trump
said
you
put
your
own
false
sense
of
virtue
before
the
lives
well-being
and
countless
innocent
people
when
you
undermine
border
security
you
are
undermining
human
rights
and
human
dignity
and
he
boasted
about
the
united
states
being
the
no
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
world
and
ripped
a
small
number
of
social
media
platforms
that
have
acquired
immense
power
over
what
we
can
see
and
over
what
we
are
allowed
to
say
even
when
it
came
to
international
issues
trump
largely
discussed
american
priorities
singling
out
china
on
trade
he
pointed
to
the
massive
tariffs
he
placed
on
chinese-made
goods
decisive
action
he
claimed
would
end
the
grave
economic
injustice
of
the
large
trade
deficit
the
u.s.
has
with
the
country
trump
however
added
that
he
was
carefully
monitoring
the
situation
in
hong
kong
how
china
chooses
to
deal
with
this
situation
will
say
a
great
deal
about
its
role
in
the
world
in
the
future
he
said
later
in
the
speech
trump
turned
his
attention
to
other
nations
taking
aim
at
venezuela
and
iran
whose
regime
he
called
one
of
the
greatest
threats
facing
peace-loving
nations
today
he
accused
iran
of
fueling
tragic
wars
in
both
syria
and
yemen
the
united
states
does
not
seek
conflict
with
any
other
country
but
i
will
never
fail
to
defend
america's
interests
trump
said
he
said
that
the
punishing
sanctions
his
administration
has
levied
on
tehran
will
not
be
lifted
as
long
as
its
menacing
behavior
continues
trump
also
called
embattled
venezuelan
dictator
nicolas
maduro
a
cuban
puppet
as
for
north
korea
trump
said
that
the
u.s.
has
never
believed
in
permanent
enemies
but
that
the
regime
must
denuclearize
but
he
ended
his
speech
on
the
same
nationalism-tinged
note
he
began
on
imploring
his
fellow
leaders
to
lift
up
your
nations
make
your
countries
strong
and
prosperous
and
righteous
honor
the
dignity
of
your
people
he
said
