inquiry
ramps
up
as
judiciary
panel
adopts
procedural
guidelines
the
house
committee
passed
a
resolution
thursday
that
sets
the
outlines
for
future
impeachment
investigation
hearings
washington
the
house
judiciary
committee
took
a
big
step
thursday
morning
in
its
ongoing
investigation
into
whether
to
recommend
the
filing
of
articles
of
impeachment
against
president
donald
trump
passing
a
resolution
that
set
procedures
and
rules
for
future
impeachment
investigation
hearings
the
resolution
passed
along
party
lines
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
said
in
his
opening
statement
thursday
but
let
me
clear
up
any
remaining
doubt
the
conduct
under
investigation
poses
a
threat
to
our
democracy
we
have
an
obligation
to
respond
to
this
threat
and
we
are
doing
so
earlier
this
week
nadler
told
nbc
news
that
the
purpose
of
the
resolution
was
to
put
into
effect
certain
procedures
to
make
that
investigation
more
effective
a
necessary
move
given
that
the
inquiry
is
getting
more
serious
under
the
resolution
which
does
not
need
to
be
approved
by
the
full
house
nadler
can
designate
hearings
run
by
the
full
committee
and
its
subcommittees
as
part
of
the
impeachment
investigation
the
committee's
lawyers
are
also
able
to
question
witnesses
for
an
additional
hour
beyond
the
five
minutes
that
are
allotted
to
each
member
of
congress
on
the
panel
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
additionally
the
president's
lawyers
will
be
able
to
respond
in
writing
to
evidence
and
testimony
presented
to
the
committee
and
evidence
can
be
received
in
closed
session
the
top
republican
on
the
judiciary
committee
rep
doug
collins
r-ga
attacked
the
resolution
insisting
it
was
not
enabling
nadler
to
do
anything
he
wasn't
already
empowered
to
do
the
judiciary
committee
has
become
a
giant
instagram
filter
making
it
appear
that
something
greater
than
what
is
happening
has
taken
place
collins
said
the
first
hearing
that
the
judiciary
committee
has
scheduled
in
which
the
procedures
will
be
in
effect
is
slated
for
sept
when
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
is
scheduled
to
testify
the
committee
has
also
subpoenaed
rick
dearborn
former
white
house
deputy
chief
of
staff
for
policy
and
rob
porter
former
white
house
staff
secretary
to
testify
that
day
as
well
the
white
house
has
previously
blocked
key
witnesses
from
appearing
before
congress
while
democrats
have
not
set
a
deadline
for
recommending
articles
of
impeachment
staffers
have
suggested
a
pre-election
year
timeframe
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
it's
the
goal
by
the
end
of
the
year
but
it's
not
a
hard
and
fast
deadline
that's
our
goal
the
aide
said
nadler
himself
has
been
less
definitive
on
a
potential
timeline
telling
nbc
news
this
week
i
don't
know
i'd
like
to
do
it
rather
rapidly
as
the
committee
meeting
was
underway
trump
tweeted
we
can't
beat
him
so
let's
impeach
him
a
quote
he
attributed
to
rep
al
green
d-texas
one
of
the
first
and
most
fervent
supporters
of
impeachment
it's
not
clear
whether
green
has
ever
actually
said
that
in
may
he
told
msnbc
i'm
concerned
that
if
we
don't
impeach
the
president
he
will
get
re-elected
in
response
to
trump
green
tweeted
because
no
one
is
above
the
law
we
must
impeach
and
if
the
senate
does
not
convict
we
will
defeat
realdonaldtrump
you
will
not
have
a
second
term
there
has
been
significant
confusion
among
lawmakers
about
the
status
of
the
investigation
nadler
said
before
congress's
six-week
summer
recess
that
the
panel
was
already
in
the
midst
of
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
other
lawmakers
have
said
that
that
hasn't
been
made
clear
nadler
reiterated
on
thursday
that
legally
there
is
no
difference
between
an
impeachment
inquiry
and
impeachment
investigation
and
said
beginning
next
week
the
committee
would
start
an
aggressive
series
of
hearings
yet
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
not
backed
down
on
her
public
stance
shying
away
from
full-blown
impeachment
the
public
isn't
there
on
impeachment
she
told
house
democrats
during
a
conference
call
in
late
august
though
she
didn't
close
the
door
on
the
possibility
of
moving
forward
in
the
future
asked
monday
if
she
agreed
with
nadler's
statement
that
impeachment
proceedings
have
already
been
taking
place
she
avoided
answering
directly
i
really
don't
know
what
the
chairman
said
i
do
know
that
we
have
been
on
a
path
of
investigation
and
that
includes
the
possibility
of
legislation
or
impeachment
she
told
reporters
pelosi
also
said
she
had
signed
off
on
nadler's
decision
to
hold
the
vote
on
the
resolution
thursday
to
establish
the
panel's
impeachment
investigation
procedures
we
have
been
in
an
impeachment
investigation
in
that
we
have
been
investigating
whether
or
not
the
judiciary
committee
is
going
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
rep
pramila
jayapal
d-wash
a
member
of
the
judiciary
panel
told
reporters
this
week
this
allows
us
to
formalize
that
and
also
allows
us
to
utilize
slightly
different
procedures
that
will
be
helpful
to
us
as
we
go
through
an
investigation
because
the
five-minute
back
and
forth
is
very
difficult
the
congressional
progressive
caucus
of
which
jayapal
is
a
co-chair
took
an
official
position
tuesday
supporting
an
impeachment
investigation
more
than
half
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
out
of
have
publicly
backed
an
impeachment
inquiry
including
out
of
the
democrats
on
the
judiciary
committee
impeachment
was
a
major
issue
during
congressional
town
halls
over
the
august
congressional
recess
as
a
significant
number
of
house
democrats
especially
freshmen
members
continued
to
wrestle
with
the
issue
republicans
continued
to
argue
that
democrats
need
to
take
an
official
vote
to
begin
any
type
of
inquiry
the
house
of
representatives
is
not
engaged
in
formal
impeachment
proceedings
as
house
democrat
leaders
continue
to
note
formal
impeachment
proceedings
have
always
been
authorized
by
a
vote
of
the
full
house
which
speaker
pelosi
has
been
careful
not
to
allow
the
top
republican
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
rep
doug
collins
r-ga
said
wednesday
calling
the
panel's
planned
thursday
action
a
meaningless
reiteration
of
existing
committee
authorities
allowing
the
chairman
to
keep
this
story
in
the
news
when
moderate
democrats
simply
want
it
to
go
away
