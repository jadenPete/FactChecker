a

washington
if
a
secret
whistleblower
complaint
covers
president
donald
trump's
dealings
with
the
president
of
ukraine
as
two
major
newspapers
have
reported
it
raises
profound
constitutional
questions
about
whether
congress
can
police
the
president's
conversations
with
foreign
leaders
legal
experts
say
a
former
intelligence
official
familiar
with
the
matter
tells
nbc
news
the
complaint
concerns
a
trump
phone
call
the
washington
post
has
reported
that
it
involves
a
promise
by
trump
centering
on
ukraine
the
new
york
times
has
also
reported
that
the
complaint
deals
in
part
with
ukraine
much
remains
unclear
but
the
reporting
on
ukraine
has
led
analysts
to
focus
on
a
phone
call
that
is
already
in
the
news
one
that
occurred
two
and
a
half
weeks
before
the
complaint
was
filed
in
august
in
that
call
trump
spoke
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
even
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
became
known
house
democrats
were
investigating
whether
trump
and
his
lawyer
rudolph
giuliani
tried
to
pressure
the
ukrainian
government
into
helping
trump's
reelection
campaign
by
re-opening
an
investigation
involving
democratic
candidate
joe
biden
lawmakers
from
several
committees
have
demanded
a
transcript
of
the
call
if
the
complaint
by
the
intelligence
official
is
about
something
trump
said
on
that
call
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
explaining
the
legal
disagreement
over
whether
the
whistleblower
complaint
should
be
turned
over
to
the
congressional
intelligence
oversight
committees
what
it
comes
down
to
it
appears
is
that
the
justice
department
and
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
are
arguing
that
what
trump
did
however
inappropriate
did
not
involve
an
intelligence
activity
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
does
not
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
intelligence
committees
this
argument
would
make
some
sense
if
the
allegation
is
that
trump
improperly
sought
to
pressure
a
foreign
leader
for
personal
gain
in
other
words
that
he
used
the
awesome
power
of
the
u.s.
presidency
in
an
effort
to
target
his
political
opponent
if
trump
didn't
specifically
promise
to
use
intelligence
agencies
or
capabilities
to
help
or
hurt
ukraine
and
instead
talked
about
military
aid
for
example
the
lawyers
may
have
concluded
that
the
complaint
did
not
cover
an
intelligence
activity
protected
by
the
intelligence
community
whistleblowers
protection
act
some
legal
scholars
such
as
harvard's
jack
goldsmith
are
making
an
even
broader
argument
that
the
president
can
say
and
do
anything
he
wants
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
which
is
purely
an
executive
branch
function
putting
it
brutally

goldsmith
a
former
bush
administration
lawyer
said
on
twitter
that
is
a
very
dangerous
discretion
to
be
sure
but
has
long
been
thought
worth
it
on
balance
those
arguing
the
other
side
say
not
if
what
trump
was
doing
was
for
his
own
personal
interests
rather
than
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
if
trump
was
trying
to
abuse
his
power
of
the
presidency
to
solicit
foreign
help
for
his
campaign
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
more
impeachable
offense
tweeted
ben
rhodes
a
former
national
security
adviser
to
president
obama
and
an
nbc
news
contributor
the
inspector
general
for
the
intelligence
community
michael
atkinson
contends
that
the
complaint
must
be
turned
over
to
the
intelligence
committees
in
a
carefully
worded
letter
explaining
his
position
he
writes
the
complainant's
disclosure
not
only
falls
within
the
dni's
jurisdiction
but
relates
to
one
of
the
most
significant
and
important
of
the
dni's
responsibilities
to
the
american
people
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
trump-ukraine
allegation
that
line
could
be
a
reference
to
the
dni's
responsibility
to
preserve
and
defend
the
constitution
and
uphold
the
rule
of
law
the
upshot
is
that
the
debate
over
whether
the
complaint
must
be
turned
over
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
is
a
narrow
one
and
not
the
whole
story
it
may
well
be
that
as
a
legal
matter
this
complaint
doesn't
properly
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
intelligence
committees
if
schiff
takes
this
to
court
he
may
not
win
the
larger
question
scholars
say
is
trump
did
something
improper
in
negotiating
with
a
foreign
leader
does
congress
have
a
right
to
learn
about
it
and
conduct
oversight
if
so
how
if
not
the
intelligence
committees
who
has
a
right
to
learn
about
this
and
investigate
