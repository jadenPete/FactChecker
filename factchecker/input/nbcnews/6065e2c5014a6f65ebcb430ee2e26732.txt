energy
efficiency
on
a
night
that
featured
the
democratic
debate
president
donald
trump
said
he's
being
cast
in
a
harsh
light
trump's
complaint
wasn't
about
the
candidates
vying
for
the
nomination
and
the
chance
to
make
the
th
president
a
one-termer
but
was
rather
was
directed
at
light
bulbs
people
said

trump
said
during
a
speech
at
a
house
republican
retreat
dinner
the
audience
at
the
house
republican
conference
member
retreat
dinner
laughed
at
the
comment
it's
not
the
first
time
the
president
has
been
described
as
orange
the
hue
of
his
hair
and
skin
are
often
a
source
of
jokes
among
his
critics
he
said
he's
not
the
only
one
that
the
bulbs
affect
he
told
the
crowd
that
they
too
take
on
an
orange
tone
under
the
lights
the
trump
administration
last
week
said
it
would
roll
back
requirements
for
energy-efficient
light
bulbs
under
two
previous
administrations
under
one
action
the
department
of
energy
plans
to
repeal
a
regulation
enacted
under
president
obama
requiring
an
expanded
number
of
light
bulbs
in
the
u.s.
to
be
in
compliance
with
stricter
energy
efficiency
standards
and
nixed
new
energy
efficiency
standards
for
all
pear-shaped
light
bulbs
that
were
also
scheduled
to
go
into
effect
jan
the
first
regulation
being
targeted
was
spun
off
of
a
law
signed
by
president
george
w.
bush
that
aimed
to
gradually
phase
out
energy
inefficient
bulbs
like
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
the
light
is
the
worst
trump
said
at
the
retreat
dinner
he
also
said
that
it's
many
times
more
expensive
than
that
old
incandescent
bulb
that
worked
very
well
and
the
light
is
not
as
good
the
president
said
adding
that
we're
going
to
sell
that
but
we're
also
going
to
sell
incandescent
bulbs
environmental
groups
argue
that
ending
the
regulations
will
result
in
higher
utility
bills
for
americans
and
the
production
of
more
electricity
by
greenhouse-gas
emitting
power
plants
trump
at
thursday's
annual
retreat
also
took
aim
at
several
democratic
presidential
candidates
