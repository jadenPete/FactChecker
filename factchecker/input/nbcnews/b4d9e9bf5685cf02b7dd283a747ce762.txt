son
pelosi
on
wednesday
said
that
the
release
of
the
notes
of
the

by
the

confirms
that
the
president
engaged
in
behavior
that
undermines
the
integrity
of
our
elections
the
dignity
of
the
office
he
holds
and
our
national
security
the
president
has
tried
to
make
lawlessness
a
virtue
in
america
and
now
is
exporting
it
abroad
biden
released
a
statement
later
on
wednesday
saying
it
is
a
tragedy
for
this
country
that
our
president
put
personal
politics
above
his
sacred
oath
he
has
put
his
own
political
interests
over
our
national
security
interest
which
is
bolstering
ukraine
against
russian
pressure
it
is
an
affront
to
every
single
american
and
the
founding
values
of
our
country
congress
must
pursue
the
facts
and
quickly
take
prompt
action
to

accountable

tweeted
this
transcript
itself
is
a
smoking
gun
if
this
is
the
version
of
events
the
president's
team
thinks
is
most
favorable
he
is
in
very
deep
jeopardy
we
need
to
see
the
full
whistleblower
complaint
and
the
administration
needs
to
follow
the
law
now
the
july
call
was
thrust
into
the
spotlight
following
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
new
york
times
and
other
outlets
said
was
tied
to
the
call
the
complaint
has
been
the
subject
of
a
weeks-long
standoff
between
congress
and
the
white
house
nbc
news
has
not
confirmed
that
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
the
whistleblower
issue
sen
cory
booker
another

issued
a
statement
saying
we
said
trump
has
been
corrupting
the
office
since
the
beginning
and
today
the
white
house
said
they
agreed
this
document
is
apparent
proof
that
trump
pressured
a
foreign
nation
to
meddle
in
our
democracy
again
and
in
doing
so
he
again
disrespected
our
constitution
subverted
the
rule
of
law
and
ultimately
undermined
the
very
ideals
of
our
country
congressional
republicans
were
far
less
critical
of
the
president
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
on
wednesday
took
to
the
senate
floor
to
decry
democrats
impeachment
efforts
he
accused
the
democrats
of
a
rush
to
judgment
to
sate
their
impeachment
addiction
he
never
explicitly
mentioned
the
call
summary
in
his
remarks
but
chided
the
democrats
for
their
never
ending
impeachment
parade
in
search
of
a
rationale
trump
ally
and
senate
judiciary
head
lindsey
graham
said
democrats
had
lost
their
minds
wow
impeachment
over
this
what
a
nothing
non-quid
pro
quo
burger
graham
tweeted
shortly
after
summary
was
made
public
sen
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
also
brushed
off
wednesday's
news
i've
read
the
transcript
in
its
entirety
he
said
in
a
statement
it
shows
that
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
the
ukrainian
president
admitted
problems
with
corruption
in
the
country
and
agreed
that
the
issue
at
hand
warranted
looking
into
further
rep
matt
gaetz
of
florida
a
close
ally
of
trump's
told
msnbc's
hallie
jackson
that
he
and
some
other
gop
lawmakers
were
invited
to
the
white
house
in
the
morning
to
review
the
call
summary
and
that
they
spoke
to
trump
on
the
phone
about
what
it
contained
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
in
this
transcript
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
there
is
no
improper
leverage
and
the
overall
tone
of
this
transcript
is
that
it
is
mutual
laudatory
he
said
the
ranking
republican
on
the
house
oversight
committee
jim
jordan
of
ohio
maintained
the
summary
shows
no
wrongdoing
and
that
the
real
scandal
involves
biden
and
his
son
sen
mitt
romney
of
utah
however
sounded
a
note
of
concern
telling
nbc
news
that
he
found
the
call
summary
troubling
in
the
extreme
deeply
troubling
asked
if
he
supported
the
impeachment
proceedings
the
former
republican
presidential
nominee
said
he
wouldn't
give
advice
to
pelosi
but
noted
that
the
senate
was
continuing
to
look
into
the
whistleblower
complaint
pennsyvlania
sen
pat
toomey
said
in
a
statement
that
the
call
was
inappropriate
but
that
the
summary
released
wednesday
reveals
no
quid
pro
quo
and
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
an
impeachable
offense
