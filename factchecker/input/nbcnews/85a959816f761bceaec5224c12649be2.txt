this
schiff
trump
or
people
around
him
likely
behind
effort
to
keep
whistleblower
details
from
congress
i
believe
that
there
is
an
effort
to
prevent

information
getting

the
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
said
thursday
of
a
recent
whistleblower
complaint
washington
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
said
thursday
that
he
believed
it
was
likely
that
president
donald
trump
or
his
aides
were
working
to
keep
the
details
of
an
urgent
complaint
by
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower
from
congress
i
believe
that
there
is
an
effort
to
prevent
this
information
getting
to
congress
and
if
the
assertion
is
accurate
that
the
department
of
justice
has
made
and
the
dni
has
affirmed
that
this
involves
a
potentially
privileged
communication
then
at
one
level
or
another
it
likely
involves
either
the
president
or
people
around
him
schiff
told
reporters
following
a
closed-door
briefing
with
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
and
the
intelligence
committee's
members
that
lasted
several
hours
a
congressional
source
tells
nbc
news
that
atkinson
declined
to
reveal
to
lawmakers
the
substance
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
nbc
news
and
others
have
confirmed
pertains
to
a
phone
call
by
the
president
the
news
was
first
reported
by
the
new
york
times
trump
has
denied
the
allegation
atkinson
a
former
career
justice
department
lawyer
who
was
appointed
by
trump
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
believed
the
complaint
should
be
turned
over
to
congress
but
was
overruled
according
to
documents
made
public
in
recent
days
we
do
not
have
the
complaint
we
do
not
know
whether
the
press
reports
are
accurate
or
inaccurate
about
the
contents
of
that
complaint
schiff
said
following
the
closed-door
session
but
what
i
do
know
is
this
if
in
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
you
have
an
employee
of
that
community
or
a
contractor
or
a
detailee
who
follows
the
law
makes
the
complaint
and
it
is
possible
for
the
subject
of
that
complaint
to
essentially
botch
the
complaint
or
keep
it
from
congress
then
this
system
is
badly
broken
schiff
said
that
atkinson
had
not
been
authorized
to
disclose
the
information
to
the
lawmakers
because
his
boss
the
director
of
national
intelligence
has
taken
the
position
that
the
complaint
does
not
fall
under
the
intelligence
community
whistleblower
protection
act
which
requires
that
urgent
concern
complaints
about
intelligence
matters
be
turned
over
to
congress
lawyers
for
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
consulted
with
the
justice
department's
office
of
legal
counsel
in
making
that
determination
a
doj
official
acknowledged
to
nbc
news
the
senate
intelligence
committee
expects
to
be
briefed
next
week
by
both
maguire
and
atkinson
on
the
whistleblower
complaint
maguire
is
also
scheduled
to
testify
next
thursday
in
a
public
session
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
we're
determined
to
do
everything
we
can
to
determine
what
this
urgent
concern
is
to
make
sure
that
the
national
security
is
protected
and
to
make
sure
that
this
whistleblower
is
protected
schiff
said
schiff
read
one
line
from
one
of
the
letters
from
atkinson
about
the
whistleblower's
complaint
that
stated
the
subject
matter
involved
not
only
falls
within
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
jurisdiction
but
relates
to
the
most
significant
and
important
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
responsibilities
to
the
american
people
this
is
what's
being
withheld
from
congress
right
now
schiff
said
asked
what
type
of
action
might
be
taken
to
obtain
the
contents
of
the
complaint
the
chairman
said
that
democrats
are
exploring
their
options
with
house
general
counsel
including
legal
ones
we
will
have
a
very
good
case
to
seek
a
mandatory
restraining
order
he
said
giving
one
example
it's
not
a
situation
where
we
can
afford
to
go
through
weeks
or
months
of
litigation
in
this
court
or
that
court
there's
an
urgency
here
that
i
think
the
courts
will
recognize
