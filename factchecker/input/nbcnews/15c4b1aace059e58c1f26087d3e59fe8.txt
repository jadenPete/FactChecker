share
this
trump
praises
rollout
of
pelosi's
drug
pricing
bill
after
mcconnell
rejects
the
measure
mcconnell
said
in
an
interview
hours
before
trump's
tweet
that
pelosi's
measure
is
dead
on
arrival
in
the
senate
washington
president
donald
trump
and
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
don't
appear
to
be
on
the
same
page
regarding
the
house
democrats
drug
pricing
proposal
trump
praised
the
rollout
of
the
plan
by
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
on
thursday
tweeting
that
it's
great
to
see
speaker
pelosi's
bill
today
let's
get
it
done
in
a
bipartisan
way
he
also
said
that
he
very
much
likes
drug
pricing
legislation
proposed
by
senate
finance
committee
chairman
chuck
grassley
r-iowa
and
ranking
member
ron
wyden
d-ore
just
hours
earlier
mcconnell
told
politico
that
pelosi's
measure
however
is
dead
on
arrival
in
the
senate
socialist
price
controls
will
do
a
lot
of
left-wing
damage
to
the
health
care
system
and
of
course
we're
not
going
to
be
calling
up
a
bill
like
that
mcconnell
said
sen
john
cornyn
r-texas
echoed
that
sentiment
on
the
senate
floor
the
speaker's
plan
is
just
the
latest
example
of
a
partisan
messaging
document
masquerading
as
legislation
and
it
has
absolutely
no
chance
zero
zip
nada
no
chance
of
passing
the
senate
or
becoming
law
cornyn
said
unlike
the
house
we've
been
considering
bills
that
have
broad
bipartisan
support
as
i
said
which
means
they
have
the
potential
to
actually
become
law
to
get
something
done
pelosi's
bill
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
negotiate
the
prices
of
at
least
and
potentially
as
many
as
brand-name
drugs
for
medicare
beneficiaries
we're
saying
is
the
floor
pelosi
said
at
a
news
conference
after
introducing
the
measure
we'd
like
it
to
be
the
highest
number
possible
of
the
highest
cost
drugs
that
make
the
biggest
difference
those
drugs
without
competition
so
it
is
transformative
pelosi
added
that
she
hopes
to
have
white
house
buy-in
acknowledging
that
they
would
need
trump's
endorsement
to
garner
votes
in
the
senate
trump
has
made
reducing
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
a
priority
as
he
seeks
re-election
and
like
the
house
democratic
proposal
his
administration
has
considered
tying
drug
prices
to
the
costs
of
the
drugs
in
several
developed
countries
grassley
and
wyden's
bill
which
trump
praised
also
shares
some
similarities
with
the
democrats
measure
both
bills
would
require
drug
companies
to
issue
rebates
to
medicare
if
they
increase
drug
costs
faster
than
inflation
and
it
would
cap
out-of-pocket
costs
for
seniors
under
medicare
the
senate
bill
also
faces
opposition
from
republicans
and
most
of
those
on
the
finance
committee
voted
against
the
legislation
in
july
when
the
panel
advanced
the
measure
