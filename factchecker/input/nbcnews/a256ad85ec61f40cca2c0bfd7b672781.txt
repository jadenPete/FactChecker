said
critics
warn
it
will

of
good

for
decades
gun
politics
have
had
a
familiar
rhythm
democrats
ask
for
modest
restrictions
on
certain
firearms
and
their
sales
and
gun
rights
groups
warn
voters
that
they're
coming
to
take
your
guns
away
beto
o'rourke
threw
those
terms
out
the
window
at
thursday
night's
democratic
primary
debate
confidently
staking
out
a
new
left
pole
on
guns

jumping
off
a
proposal
by
rep
eric
swalwell
d-calif
who
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
contest
earlier
this
year
o'rourke
has
called
for
a
mandatory
buyback
of
firearms
covered
under
a
prospective
assault
weapons
ban
the
idea
also
has
support
from
activist
survivors
of
the
parkland
high
school
shooting
and
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
has
backed
the
broad
framework
in
the
past
a
prior
assault
weapons
ban
and
proposed
new
ones
grandfathered
in
guns
that
had
already
been
purchased
the
nra
estimates
upwards
of
million
firearms
that
would
be
considered
assault
weapons
are
in
circulation
today
on
msnbc's
morning
joe
on
friday
o'rourke
made
clear
he
didn't
envision
a
scenario
in
which
federal
agents
actively
confront
noncomplying
gun
owners
in
their
homes
nor
is
there
a
registry
of
individual
firearms
they
would
be
able
to
consult
to
do
so
it
is
mandatory
it
will
be
the
law
o'rourke
said
you
will
be
required
to
comply
with
the
law
so
as
with
many
of
our
laws
we
don't
go
door-to-door
searching
people's
homes
to
see
if
they
are
in
fact
breaking
the
law
we
expect
people
to
comply
with
the
law
but
there
are
still
serious
concerns
including
from
gun
safety
advocates
about
how
to
implement
such
a
buyback
especially
if
many
gun
owners
refuse
to
comply
as
democrats
debate
mass
incarceration
and
whether
the
government
has
gone
too
far
in
prosecuting
and
jailing
americans
in
the
past
a
ban
on
existing
weapons
could
suddenly
open
up
millions
of
residents
to
gun
charges
if
they
come
into
contact
with
police
investigating
lesser
crimes
some
activist
groups
have
suggested
an
alternate
approach
that
treats
assault
weapons
like
machine
guns
which
are
required
to
be
registered
and
taxed
but
are
still
legal
to
own
and
rarely
used
in
crime
in
both
cases
though
compliance
could
still
be
a
significant
issue
on
msnbc
o'rourke
predicted
most
americans
are
going
to
comply
with
the
law
if
his
proposal
were
to
be
enacted
based
on
his
conversations
with
gun
owners
and
only
the
far
outlier
is
going
to
be
a
challenge
that's
not
totally
clear
however
so
far
state
laws
that
require
gun
owners
to
register
guns
or
get
rid
of
extended
magazines
have
appeared
to
generate
low
levels
of
participation
what
you're
doing
is
turning
good
guys
into
criminals
jon
caldara
a
gun
rights
activists
who
is
refusing
to
comply
with
a
local
assault
weapons
ban
in
boulder
colorado
told
nbc
news
last
month
thursday
night
offered
a
grim
preview
of
how
this
dynamic
could
get
ugly
a
texas
state
lawmaker
tweeted
at
o'rourke
my
ar
is
ready
for
you
which
o'rourke
labeled
a
death
threat
and
said
was
proof
that
clearly
you
shouldn't
own
an
ar-
and
neither
should
anyone
else
