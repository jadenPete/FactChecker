drops

officials
in

decided
it's
not

money
to
fight
for

ordinance
banning

from
appearing

in
public
fort
collins
colorado
has
decided
it's
not
worth
the
money
to
fight
for
its
ordinance
banning
women
from
appearing
topless
in
public
it's
a
victory
for
free
the
nipple
a
global
movement
seeking
equal
treatment
for
women
in
february
when
it
was
cold
enough
that
few
would
want
to
go
topless
in
the
community
north
of
denver
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
upheld
a
federal
judge's
conclusion
that
the
law
amounted
to
unconstitutional
discrimination
it
was
based
on
negative
stereotypes
depicting
women's
breasts
but
not
men's
breasts
as
sex
objects
the
court
concluded
the
ruling
rejected
the
city's
concern
that
striking
down
the
ordinance
would
lead
to
women
parading
in
front
of
elementary
schools
or
swimming
topless
in
the
public
pool
the
nearby
communities
of
boulder
and
denver
allow
female
toplessness
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
harmful
fallout
in
those
cities
the
court
said
fort
collins
decided
this
month
not
to
appeal
the
decision
having
spent
more
than
defending
the
law
and
now
the
city
has
formally
removed
the
law
from
its
public
nudity
statutes
the
prohibition
on
public
exposure
of
breasts
by
women
and
girls
over
years
old
is
now
gone
from
the
city
code
as
of
this
week
with
no
guarantee
of
success
in
the
supreme
court
the
city
council
concluded
that
the
money
was
just
better
spent
on
other
city
priorities
said
tyler
marr
a
fort
collins
government
spokesman
the
decision
not
to
fight
the
ban
effectively
makes
it
legal
for
women
to
go
topless
in
the
six
states
that
fall
under
the
th
circuit
wyoming
utah
colorado
kansas
new
mexico
and
oklahoma
most
other
courts
have
rejected
equal-protection
challenges
to
bans
on
female
toplessness
as
the
tenth
circuit
acknowledged
in
its
february
ruling
saying
ours
is
the
minority
viewpoint
but
the
ruling
said
the
trend
has
been
toward
requiring
more
not
less
judicial
scrutiny
when
asserted
physical
differences
are
raised
to
justify
gender-based
discrimination
a
challenge
to
a
local
topless
ban
in
new
hampshire
is
now
pending
before
the
us
supreme
court
brought
by
three
women
who
appeared
topless
at
a
lakeside
beach
the
state
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
the
law
threats
men
and
women
differently
but
it
said
public
exposure
of
the
female
breast
almost
invariably
conveys
sexual
overtones
the
u.s.
supreme
court
will
announce
later
this
year
whether
it
will
hear
the
case
