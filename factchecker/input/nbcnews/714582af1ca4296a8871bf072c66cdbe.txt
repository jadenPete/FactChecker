threatening

against

for

and

d-r
i.
told
lewandowski
cicilline
later
suggested
that
lawmakers
hold
the
former
trump
aide
in
contempt
of
congress
as
the
section
of
the
hearing
featuring
member
questions
drew
to
a
close
nadler
made
the
same
threat
telling
lewandowski
that
his
behavior
tuesday
was
unacceptable
nadler
himself
said
as
the
hearing
began
that
the
white
house's
effort
to
stop
or
limit
former
staff
from
speaking
fully
before
congress
amounted
to
a
shocking
and
dangerous
assertion
of
executive
privilege
and
absolute
immunity
the
white
house
is
advancing
a
new
dangerous
theory
of
crony
privilege
it
makes
absolute
immunity
look
good
by
comparison
where
are
the
limits
he
asked
at
the
hearing
this
is
a
cover-up
plain
and
simple
the
white
house
on
monday
night
invoked
executive
privilege
over
any
discussions
lewandowski
might
have
had
with
president
donald
trump
and
other
top
white
house
staff
that
were
not
already
included
in
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
the
white
house
also
ordered
two
former
top
aides
to
defy
congressional
subpoenas
with
white
house
counsel
pat
cipollone
writing
to
nadler
that
constitutional
immunity
protected
rob
porter
the
ex-white
house
staff
secretary
and
rick
dearborn
who
served
as
deputy
chief
of
staff
from
having
to
testify
the
white
house
was
backed
up
by
the
justice
department
porter
dearborn
and
lewandowski
had
all
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
committee
for
tuesday's
hearing
titled
presidential
obstruction
of
justice
and
abuse
of
power
a
top
democratic
house
judiciary
committee
source
told
nbc
news
tuesday
that
the
point
of
the
hearing
had
been
to
expose
trump
to
another
possible
pathway
to
impeachment
obstructing
congress
by
not
fully
complying
with
a
subpoena
this
source
pointed
to
what
democratic
committee
leadership
saw
as
lewandoski's
repeated
refusal
to
answer
direct
questions
the
baseless
privilege
constraints
the
white
house
put
on
lewandowski's
testimony
and
the
two
white
house
lawyers
seated
behind
him
who
effectively
enforced
it
lewandowski
said
the
staffer
had
spent
the
day
providing
perfect
evidence
for
what
comprised
article
of
the
nixon
impeachment
in
his
opening
statement
at
the
hearing
lewandowski
told
the
panel
that
democrats
had
sold
americans
a
false
narrative
about
possible
collusion
between
the
campaign
and
russia
during
the
presidential
race
what
there
has
been
however
is
harassment
of
the
president
from
the
day
he
won
the
election
lewandowski
said
nadler
asked
lewandowski
whether
he
had
met
with
trump
alone
in
the
oval
office
in
june
as
referred
to
in
mueller's
report
and
discussed
limiting
the
scope
of
the
mueller
investigation
lewandowski
asked
for
the
committee
to
provide
him
with
a
particular
citation
in
the
report
before
he
would
answer
the
question
lewandowski
dodged
other
questions
asked
by
democrats
the
white
house
has
directed
me
that
i
not
disclose
the
substance
of
any
conversations
with
the
president
or
his
advisers
he
said
during
an
exchange
with
rep
steve
cohen
d-tenn
lewandowski
said
that
trump's
request
that
he
deliver
a
message
to
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
limit
the
mueller
inquiry
had
not
violated
any
laws
i
didn't
think
the
president
asked
me
to
do
anything
illegal
he
said
the
hearing
was
the
first
the
committee
had
held
since
it
passed
a
measure
defining
the
process
of
investigating
the
president's
possible
obstruction
of
justice
with
a
view
to
determining
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
to
the
full
house
trump
appeared
satisfied
with
his
former
aide's
opening
comments
tweeting
a
few
minutes
later
that
lewandowski's
remarks
at
the
top
of
the
hearing
had
been
beautiful
gop
lawmakers
on
the
committee
defended
lewandowski's
decision
to
follow
the
white
house's
orders
to
withhold
information
and
accused
democrats
of
treating
trump's
former
aide
unfairly
nadler
had
blasted
the
white
house's
limits
ahead
of
the
hearing
the
president
would
have
us
believe
that
he
can
willfully
engage
in
criminal
activity
and
prevent
witnesses
from
testifying
before
congress
even
if
they
did
not
actually
work
for
him
or
his
administration
nadler
said
in
a
statement
on
monday
night
if
he
were
to
prevail
in
this
cover-up
while
the
judiciary
committee
is
considering
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
he
would
upend
the
separation
of
powers
as
envisioned
by
our
founders
he
added
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
steven
groves
with
regard
to
porter
and
dearborn
said
that
previous
administrations
had
taken
similar
legal
positions
regarding
their
staff
groves
added
that
while
lewandowski
would
testify
about
what
was
in
mueller's
report
information
about
his
communications
with
trump
or
the
president's
senior
advisers
not
already
disclosed
in
the
mueller
report
remains
confidential
congress
cannot
compel
disclosure
of
the
substance
of
those
communications
and
mr
lewandowski
has
been
directed
not
to
testify
about
them
rob
porter's
lawyer
brant
w.
bishop
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
that
his
client
was
under
conflicting
and
contradictory
directives
from
two
coequal
branches
congress
has
instructed
him
to
testify
and
the
president
has
instructed
him
not
to
do
so
mr
porter's
absence
today
reflects
his
respect
for
the
constitutional
responsibilities
of
all
three
branches
of
the
federal
government
in
resolving
this
conflict
congress
and
the
president
may
reach
an
accommodation
or
the
judiciary
may
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
courts
bishop
said
as
mr
porter
communicated
to
chairman
nadler
yesterday
evening
if
and
when
this
conflict
is
resolved
he
will
fulfill
his
duty
whether
that
means
to
provide
appropriate
testimony
or
to
uphold
the
prerogatives
of
the
office
of
the
presidency
the
widely
expected
white
house
moves
on
porter
dearborn
and
lewandowski
each
of
whom
were
featured
prominently
in
mueller's
report
echoed
earlier
attempts
to
curtail
or
prevent
former
staffers
from
testifying
before
congress
such
as
former
white
house
counsel
donald
mcgahn
rebecca
shabad
and
alex
moe
reported
from
washington
and
allan
smith
from
new
york
