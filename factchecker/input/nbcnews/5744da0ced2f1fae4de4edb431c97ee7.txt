washington
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
defended
his
call
for
mandatory
buybacks
of
certain
semi-automatic
weapons
in
an
exclusive
interview
on
meet
the
press
sunday
pushing
back
on
criticism
from
republicans
as
well
as
some
from
within
his
own
party
who
think
the
democratic
presidential
hopeful's
proposal
has
gone
too
far
o'rourke
said
the
opposition
to
his
proposal
shows
how
screwed
up
the
priorities
in
washington
d.c.
are
while
evoking
recent
high-profile
mass
shootings
like
the
one
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
i
refuse
to
even
acknowledge
the
politics
or
the
polling
or
the
fear
or
the
nra
that
has
purchased
the
complicity
and
silence
of
members
of
congress
he
said
and
this
weak
response
to
a
real
tragedy
in
america
gun
deaths
a
year
we've
got
to
do
something
about
it
and
i'm
proposing
we
do
something
about
it
o'rourke's
plan
would
ban
weapons
classified
as
assault
weapons
as
well
as
high-capacity
magazines
and
silencers
it
would
also
mandate
that
people
who
own
weapons
that
become
illegal
under
the
new
policy
sell
their
guns
back
to
the
government
when
asked
why
his
position
shifted
from
beyond
his
initial
call
for
an
assault
weapon
ban
with
no
mandatory
buyback
the
texan
pointed
to
the
recent
tragedy
in
his
hometown
that
prompted
him
to
take
a
break
from
campaigning
before
returning
as
an
even
more
vocal
proponent
of
reforming
gun
laws
on
aug
in
el
paso
with
people
killed
and
dozens
more
grievously
injured
i
could
no
longer
accept
that
would
be
enough
because
there
are
still
more
than
million
assault
weapons
weapons
of
war
out
on
the
street
he
said
if
we
agree
they
are
dangerous
to
sell
and
that
we
should
stop
selling
them
then
we
also
have
to
agree
that
these
are
instruments
of
terror
that
are
still
out
there
and
have
to
be
brought
back
home
or
they
are
going
to
be
used
against
us
o'rourke's
proposal
has
become
central
to
his
presidential
bid
after
he
passionately
defended
his
buyback
proposal
on
the
debate
stage
last
week
his
campaign
attempted
to
seize
on
the
moment
to
fill
its
fundraising
coffers
offering
a
shirt
on
its
online
store
that
reads
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
but
that
direct
call
has
prompted
criticism
from
republicans
as
well
as
concern
from
within
his
own
party
delaware
democratic
sen
chris
coons
who
has
endorsed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
told
cnn
on
friday
that
he
thinks
the
plan
plays
into
the
talking
point
from
republicans
that
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
and
said
that
he
thinks
the
proposal
isn't
wise
and
pennsylvania
republican
sen
patrick
toomey
who
has
been
one
of
the
more
prominent
republican
voices
working
to
strengthen
gun
background
check
requirements
called
the
plan
an
awful
and
extreme
idea
that
undermines
and
hurts
bipartisan
efforts
to
actually
make
progress
on
commonsense
gun
safety
efforts
asked
about
that
criticism
o'rourke
brushed
it
aside
to
argue
there's
more
bipartisan
consensus
on
the
issue
than
it
might
seem
this
is
constitutionally
sound
this
is
absolutely
necessary
if
we
care
about
the
lives
of
our
fellow
americans
he
said
not
only
is
this
constitutionally
sound
i
think
there's
support
beyond
the
democratic
party
to
include
republicans
and
independents
gun-owners
and
non-gun
owners
alike
to
do
the
right
thing
