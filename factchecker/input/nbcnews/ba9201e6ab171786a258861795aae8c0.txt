president
donald
trump's
visit
to
the
border
with
mexico
here
was
attended
by
only
a
handful
of
supporters
and
protesters
some
saying
that
a
border
wall
would
protect
the
nation
and
others
that
it
won't
address
the
area's
real
problem
of
smuggling
tunnels
trump's
stop
in
the
otay
mesa
community
was
announced
monday
night
leaving
little
time
to
plan
organized
events
for
his
p

arrival
the
first
time
he
came
to
this
neighborhood
in
early
dozens
of
anti-trump
protesters
shouted
at
the
president
from
both
sides
of
the
border
a
few
die-hard
trump
fans
were
there

supporter
danny
duran
had
an
american
flag
draped
over
his
shoulders
as
the
president's
motorcade
of
armored
chevrolet
suburban
suvs
rolled
by
en
route
to
a
dirt
road
that
would
take
him
to
a
section
of
upgraded
border
barriers
unveiled
last
month
the
wall
duran
said
is
good
for
his
campaign
but
it's
good
for
america
though
the
barrier
is
part
of
a
long-planned
fence
replacement
duran
was
convinced
this
was
trump's
wall
we
need
the
wall
he
said
why
not
protect
our
country
i
got
a
fence
on
my
property
the
trump
well-wishers
were
confined
to
a
neighborhood
of
industrial
parks
about
a
half
mile
from
the
president's
appearance
at
the
border
some
of
the
trump
supporters
there
didn't
want
to
talk
to
reporters
for
fear
of
having
their
words
misconstrued
one
called
a
reporter
fake
news
or
because
they
believed
it
would
endanger
their
families
duran
a
latino
who
speaks
spanish
was
proud
to
speak
out
i
don't
agree
with
everything
trump
says
he
said
but
he's
doing
a
good
job
luis
garcia
who
owns
a
packaging
supplies
business
nearby
wasn't
as
enthused
he
said
the
president's
past
threats
to
shut
down
the
border
and
place
tariffs
on
some
mexican
goods
has
been
bad
news
for
a
border
economy
dependent
on
trade
between
both
nations
i'm
from
the
border
he
said
i
deal
with
both
countries
people
here
don't
like
the
president
a
border
wall
won't
stop
legitimate
trade
he
said
but
neither
would
it
protect
the
otay
mesa
community
from
its
true
scourge
tunnels
that
run
from
mexico
to
warehouses
here
and
attract
cartel
traffic
he
said
they've
been
used
to
ship
drugs
wholesale
into
the
united
states
it
makes
no
sense
garcia
said
of
trump's
wall
the
wall
doesn't
work
it's
a
campaign
tactic
trump
wrapped
up
a
two-day
trip
to
california
that
included
campaign
fundraisers
in
san
francisco
beverly
hills
and
san
diego
the
million
replacement
barrier
he
observed
wednesday
runs
for
miles
from
imperial
beach
to
otay
mesa
trump
plans
to
use
billion
earmarked
for
the
pentagon
to
help
construct
miles
of
wall
along
the
southern
border
last
year
trump
vowed
that
a
new
border
wall
would
stop
percent
of
unauthorized
crossings
along
the
border
at
san
diego
now
we
have
a
world
class
security
system
at
the
border

said
