wrote
kelly
is
likely
to
be
the
democratic
nominee

one
of
the

closely
watched
contests
of

sen
martha
mcsally
who
was
appointed

seen
as
vulnerable
before
her

mcsally
was
defeated
last

in
the
race
for
arizona's
other
senate
seat
this
dangerous
rhetoric
has
absolutely
no
place

what's
wrong
with
our
politics

mark
kelly
is
running
for
senate
to
overcome
this
type
of
nasty
divisiveness
that
does
nothing
for
arizonans

defended
her
email
on
twitter
and
blasted
journalists
for
reporting
on
the
controversy
she
said
she
doesn't
wish
kelly
any
harm
dishonest
stories
like
this
are
dangerous
and
irresponsible
she
wrote

was
known
for
inflammatory
rhetoric
during
her
own
two
unsuccessful
campaigns
for
the
u.s.
senate
both
of
which
she
lost
in
the
primary
she
took
over
as
