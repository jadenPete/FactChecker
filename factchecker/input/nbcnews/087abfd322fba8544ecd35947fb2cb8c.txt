hostage
taking

for
global
action
the
u.n.

there
are
dozens
of
foreign
nationals
detained
in
iran
but
many
families
choose
not
to
make
their
cases
public
families
of
americans
and
a
british
citizen
held
in
iran
appealed
for
international
action
tuesday
to
win
the
release
of
their
loved
ones
accusing
the
regime
in
tehran
of
engaging
in
hostage
taking
a
few
blocks
from
where
world
leaders
including
iran's
president
gathered
at
the
u.n.
general
assembly
this
week
relatives
of
prisoners
in
tehran
spoke
to
reporters
to
try
to
draw
more
attention
to
the
plight
of
those
held
behind
bars
in
iran
and
to
urge
governments
to
show
more
urgency
in
winning
their
release
babak
namazi
whose
iranian
american
brother
siamak
has
been
imprisoned
since
and
whose
year-old
father
baquer
has
been
held
since
said
the
plight
of
foreign
detainees
was
too
often
overlooked
amid
iran's
confrontation
with
the
united
states
he
and
other
relatives
of
detainees
said
they
had
given
up
on
adopting
a
low
profile
and
were
now
ready
to
speak
out
publicly
to
ensure
their
loved
ones
were
not
forgotten
we
can't
do
this
alone
please
step
up
don't
leave
us
alone
in
this
cause
that
is
fully
and
morally
justified
namazi
told
reporters
this
is
not
an
american
a
british
or
an
iranian
problem
namazi
said
this
is
becoming
endemic
and
becoming
extremely
important
to
view
as
an
international
problem
the
relatives
said
they
had
formed
an
organization
the
families
alliance
to
raise
awareness
of
what
they
called
the
growing
phenomenon
of
state
hostage
taking
by
iran
and
other
governments
richard
ratcliffe
whose
british
iranian
wife
nazanin
zaghari-ratcliffe
has
been
imprisoned
since
said
western
governments
needed
to
publicly
confront
iran
over
its
detention
of
foreigners
which
he
said
was
clearly
an
effort
to
take
hostages
to
gain
leverage
the
biggest
criticism
i
have
for
the
british
government
and
other
governments
is
there's
a
real
reluctance
to
name
what's
going
on
here
ratcliffe
told
reporters
ratcliffe
said
he
thinks
iran's
approach
seems
to
be
working
because
it's
not
being
called
out
by
the
world
it's
become
the
norm
he
said
ratcliffe
carried
out
a
hunger
strike
in
london
outside
the
iranian
embassy
this
year
in
solidarity
with
his
wife
who
was
on
hunger
strike
in
prison
zaghari-ratcliffe
ended
her
strike
after
days
human
rights
groups
have
accused
iran
of
arbitrarily
arresting
foreigners
often
those
with
dual
nationality
and
convicting
them
on
baseless
charges
in
secretive
trials
the
united
nations
working
group
on
arbitrary
detention
has
declared
the
imprisonment
of
the
namazis
and
zaghari-ratcliffe
illegal
and
demanded
their
unconditional
release
there
are
about
known
cases
of
foreign
or
dual
nationals
detained
in
iran
since
and
many
others
whose
families
have
chosen
not
to
make
their
cases
public
according
to
a
report
from
the
u.n.
special
rapporteur
on
iran
this
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
of
the
people
that
are
being
held
there
illegally
for
no
reason
said
ali
rezaian
whose
brother
jason
a
washington
post
journalist
was
imprisoned
for
more
than
a
year
in
iran
before
being
released
iran's
u.n.
mission
in
new
york
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
iranian
officials
have
previously
rejected
charges
from
rights
groups
and
the
u.n.
saying
foreigners
imprisoned
in
the
country
were
found
guilty
in
legal
proceedings
some
of
the
relatives
expressed
disappointment
with
the
approach
of
the
united
states
and
other
western
governments
saying
the
detention
cases
appeared
to
be
given
a
lower
priority
i
really
think
that
this
whole
issue
has
been
sidelined
by
our
governments
xua
qu
said
her
husband
princeton
university
scholar
xiyue
wang
has
been
imprisoned
since
it's
all
about
the
political
will
of
the
u.s.
government
she
said
the
state
department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
trump
administration
has
said
it
is
working
tirelessly
to
secure
the
release
of
americans
imprisoned
in
iran
and
has
called
for
their
unconditional
release
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad

has
floated
the
possibility
of
swapping
foreigners
held
in
iran
for
iranian
nationals
imprisoned
in
the
u.s.
xua
qu
said
prisoner
exchanges
have
been
carried
out
in
the
past
and
she
was
open
to
any
solution
that

bring
her
husband
home
but
she
said
she
was
not
aware
of
any
secret
talks
along
