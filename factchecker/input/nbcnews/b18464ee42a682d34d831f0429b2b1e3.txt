share
this
warren
and
clinton
talk
behind
the
scenes
as
race
intensifies
analysis
neither
camp
wants
to
talk
about
it
but
the
two
women
have
recently
grown
closer
washington
elizabeth
warren's
team
doesn't
want
to
talk
about
hillary
clinton
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
presidential
candidate
isn't
talking
with
her
party's
nominee
the
two
women
have
kept
a
line
of
communication
open
since
the
massachusetts
senator
decided
to
run
for
president
though
only
a
conversation
around
the
time
of
warren's
launch
has
been
previously
reported
according
to
several
people
familiar
with
their
discussions
who
spoke
to
nbc
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
political
sensitivity
of
private
interactions
it's
hard
to
know
exactly
how
many
times
they've
reached
out
to
each
other
or
precisely
what
they've
discussed
in
part
because
neither
camp
wants
to
reveal
much
of
anything
about
their
interaction
and
in
part
because
they
have
each
other's
phone
numbers
and
there
are
many
ways
for
two
high-powered
politicians
to
communicate
that
don't
involve
their
staffs
one
source
was
aware
of
just
one
additional
call
between
warren
and
clinton
since
then
but
a
person
who
is
close
to
clinton
said
the
contact
has
been
substantial
enough
to
merit
attention
describing
a
conversation
between
the
two
as
seemingly
recent
because
it
was
front
of
mind
for
her
that
has
clearly
not
gone
unnoticed
and
i
think
she
really
appreciates
that
the
person
close
to
clinton
said
clinton
is
a
fraught
subject
for
the
democratic
contenders
perhaps
for
none
so
much
as
warren
who
in
the
shadow
of
clinton's
defeat
is
seeking
to
become
the
second
woman
to
win
the
party's
nod
and
the
first
woman
elected
president
as
she
seeks
to
blend
her
movement-based
progressive
campaign
with
a
democratic
establishment
long
wary
of
her
populist
brand
of
politics
warren
has
been
maintaining
and
creating
relationships
with
a
wide
array
of
democratic
establishment
figures
and
if
the
race
for
nomination
goes
long
as
many
democrats
now
predict
clinton
could
become
pivotal
as
an
ally
an
adversary
or
a
neutral
observer
more
immediately
warren
would
no
doubt
like
to
win
over
support
from
clinton
voters
particularly
women
and
women
of
color
as
she
battles
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
the
rest
of
a
field
that
trails
the
top-tier
triumvirate
but
warren
has
made
little
effort
to
publicly
highlight
ties
to
clinton
who
is
perceived
by
many
on
the
left
as
too
centrist
and
who
was
defeated
in
an
election
clinton
and
her
allies
believe
was
heavily
colored
by
president
donald
trump
waging
a
misogynistic
campaign
to
the
extent
that
democratic
primary
voters
fear
a
repeat
scenario
in
and
to
the
extent
that
she's
competing
with
sanders
for
the
votes
of
progressives
there
may
be
good
reason
for
warren
to
keep
her
distance
from
clinton

the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
at
the
same
time
people
who
know
and
like
both
women
say
there
are
more
similarities
between
them
than
some
of
their
partisans
would
like
to
admit
each
is
a
policy
powerhouse
with
an
uncommon
command
of
details
and
possess
the
ability
to
master
new
material
quickly
with
a
deep
intellectual
curiosity
like
clinton
warren
focused
the
early
part
of
her
campaign
on
developing
a
raft
of
policy
proposals
and
rolling
them
out
more
important
an
explicit
or
implicit
blessing
from
clinton
could
help
warren
if
she
finds
herself
battling
for
delegates
and
superdelegates
at
a
contested
democratic
convention
next
summer
hillary
clinton
would
absolutely
have
influence
over
a
number
of
delegates
to
this
convention
said
deb
kozikowski
the
vice
chair
of
the
massachusetts
democratic
party
warren
aides
declined
to
discuss
the
relationship
between
the
two
women
the
dates
or
content
of
their
conversations
or
the
campaign's
strategic
thinking
about
whether
to
show
proximity
to
or
distance
from
clinton
clinton's
spokesman
did
not
return
a
call
or
a
text
message
from
nbc
before
publication
though
warren
harshly
criticized
clinton's
vote
for
a
overhaul
of
bankruptcy
laws
the
two
have
developed
a
healthy
respect
for
each
other
in
recent
years
when
clinton
was
developing
policies
for
her
own
campaign
in
her
aides
kept
in
close
contact
with
warren
to
give
her
an
opportunity
to
raise
concerns
before
they
were
rolled
out
by
that
point
warren
already
had
opted
out
of
mounting
her
own
campaign
disappointing
many
progressives
when
she
signed
a
letter
along
with
other
democratic
women
in
the
senate
encouraging
clinton
to
run
later
as
clinton
reviewed
her
options
for
a
vice
presidential
running
mate
warren
made
a
late
ascent
onto
the
short
list
on
the
strength
of
the
excitement
clinton
and
her
advisers
thought
warren
might
bring
to
the
ticket
warren
told
bloomberg
businessweek
this
summer
that
she
would
have
accepted
the
offer
but
it
went
to
sen
tim
kaine
d-va
clinton
has
been
impressed
with
warren's
campaign
so
far
according
to
a
democratic
strategist
who
has
spoken
with
her
she
has
applauded
her
about
being
serious
and
disciplined
and
loves
that
she
is
sticking
to
her
guns
the
strategist
said
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
clinton's
remarks
were
intended
to
remain
private
clinton
has
relationships
with
most
if
not
all
of
the
democratic
candidates
and
she
met
with
or
spoke
to
many
of
them
at
the
start
of
this
campaign
cycle
mayor
pete
buttigieg
of
south
bend
indiana
sat
down
with
clinton
in
new
york
several
months
ago
when
his
star
was
rising
and
he
needed
to
clear
the
air
following
a
report
on
his
criticism
of
clinton's
campaign
but
the
contact
with
warren
appears
to
have
been
more
than
a
courtesy
call
or
a
trip
to
the
principal's
office
with
a
progressive
base
behind
her
warren's
political
need
is
to
make
establishment
democrats
comfortable
with
her
candidacy
clinton
whose
politics
arguably
have
been
closer
to
biden's
over
the
course
of
her
career
has
deep
credibility
in
those
circles
but
clinton
and
biden
developed
a
rivalry
when
they
worked
in
the
obama
administration
and
as
they
both
prepared
for
a
campaign
that
biden
ultimately
didn't
enter
she
also
might
take
into
consideration
factors
other
than
proximity
on
policy
if
she
decides
to
back
a
candidate
at
some
point
kozikowski
who
has
not
endorsed
a
presidential
candidate
said
it
would
make
sense
for
clinton
to
be
helpful
to
one
of
the
women
running
if
she
can
put
her
over
the
top
it
would
be
counterproductive
for
the
first
woman
nominee
of
the
party
to
not
be
supportive
of
a
woman
who
may
go
over
that
threshold
kozikowski
