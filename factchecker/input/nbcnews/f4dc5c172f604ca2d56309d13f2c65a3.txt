trump
defends
nothing
call
after
memo
shows
him
requesting
biden
probe
it
turned
out
to
be
a
nothing
call
other
than
a
lot
of
people
said
i
never
knew
you
could
be
so
nice
the
president
said
defending
the
conversation
amid
sharp
congressional
scrutiny
president
donald
trump
called
a
phone
conversation
where
he
asked
the
ukrainian
president
to
investigate
a
political
rival
a
perfect
call
and
a
nothing
call
on
wednesday
as
he
doubled
down
on
his
defense
there
was
no
pressure
the
way
you
had
that
built
up
that
call
it
was
going
to
be
the
call
from
hell
trump
told
reporters
during
a
meeting
at
the
united
nations
after
a
summary
of
the
call
was
released
it
turned
out
to
be
a
nothing
call
other
than
a
lot
of
people
said
i
never
knew
you
could
be
so
nice
the
president
then
looked
to
divert
attention
to
allegations
he
has
made
against
democrats
and
to
the
strength
of
the
u.s.
economy
he
also
revived
attacks
he
used
during
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
calling
the
ukraine
controversy
the
single
great
witch
hunt
in
american
history
it's
all
a
hoax
trump
told
reporters
wednesday
i
call
it
the
hoax
it's
just
a
continuation
of
the
witch
hunt
trump
in
a
midsummer
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
asked
him
to
explore
why
that
country's
top
prosecutor
apparently
had
ended
an
investigation
into
the
business
dealings
of
joe
biden's
son
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
a
memo
with
a
detailed
description
of
the
call
was
made
public
wednesday
by
the
trump
administration
under
pressure
from
democrats
who
have
launched
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
president
sought
the
help
of
a
foreign
leader
to
boost
his
campaign
the
white
house
noted
that
the
summary
of
the
call
was
not
a
verbatim
transcript
and
that
it
represented
a
record
of
the
notes
and
recollections
of
situation
room
officers
and
national
security
council
policy
staff
who
listen
to
official
conversations
as
trump
met
with
zelenskiy
wednesday
in
new
york
the
ukrainian
president
told
reporters
he
felt
no
pressure
from
trump
on
the
call
and
hadn't
pushed
anyone
to
take
action
on
an
investigation
into
biden
following
the
conversation
we
had
i
think
a
good
phone
call
zelenskiy
told
reporters
with
trump
seated
beside
him
it
was
normal
we
spoke
about
many
things
i
think
you
read
nobody
pushed
me
trump
said
he
wanted
zelenskiy
to
do
whatever
he
can
on
corruption
adding
that
his
own
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
has
every
right
to
be
investigating
possible
misdeeds
in
the
ukraine
trump
had
said
in
the
july
call
that
he
wanted
giuliani
and
attorney
general
william
barr
to
speak
with
zelenskiy
in
a
tweetstorm
following
the
release
trump
sought
to
divert
attention
to
a
story
about
several
democrats
in
congress
writing
to
the
ukrainian
government
related
to
the
mueller
investigation
quoted
a
fox
news
anchor
saying
there
was
no
direct
quid
pro
quo
and
fumed
that
democrats
owed
him
an
apology
trump
has
tweeted
or
posted
retweets
about
the
ukraine
controversy

the
united

assembly
will
the
democrats
apologize
after
seeing
what
was
said
on

with
the
ukrainian

should
a
perfect
call

nancy
pelosi
announced
a
formal
inquiry
on
tuesday
saying
that
the
president's
growing
ukraine
scandal
marked
a
breach
of
his
constitutional
responsibilities
the
fact
is
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
breach
of
his
constitutional
responsibilities
has
asked
a
foreign
government
to
help
him
in
his
political
campaign
at
the
expense
of
our
national
security
as
well
as
undermining

integrity
of
our
elections
that
cannot
stand

utah
has
raised
concern
with
the

far
calling
the
conversation
detailed
in

troubling
in
the
extreme
trump's
campaign
along
with

is
another

the
facts
prove

nothing
wrong
the

said
in

this
is
just
another

from

and
the
media
contributing
to
the
landslide
re-election
of
