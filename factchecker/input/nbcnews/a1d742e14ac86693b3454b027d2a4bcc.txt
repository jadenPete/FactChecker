he
did

the

of
the
person
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
a
complaint
made
by
a
whistleblowing
intelligence
officer
who
filed
the
report
after
learning
of
a
promise
president
donald
trump
made
to
a
foreign
leader
the
washington
post
reported
thursday
evening
the
newspaper
cited
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
whom
it
did
not
name
the
trump
administration
has
withheld
the
details
of
the
report
from
congress
though
it
was
known
that
the
complaint
involved
a
foreign
leader
the
post
was
the
first
to
report
the
country
involved
nbc
news
has
not
confirmed
that
ukraine
is
at
the
center
of
the
issue
a
request
for
comment
from
the
white
house
was
not
immediately
returned
taking
questions
from
reporters
alongside
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
friday
trump
defended
himself
calling
the
complaint
a
political
hack
job
he
contended
that
the
whistleblower
was
a
partisan
before
telling
reporters
he
did
not
know
the
identity
of
the
person
it's
ridiculous
it's
a
partisan
whistleblower
they
shouldn't
even
have
information
trump
said
in
the
oval
office
i've
had
conversations
with
many
leaders
that
are
always
appropriate
i
think
scott
can
tell
you
that
always
appropriate
at
the
highest
level
always
appropriate
and
anything
i
do
i
fight
for
this
country
i
fight
so
strongly
for
this
country
it's
just
another
political
hack
job
that's
all
it
is
he
also
pushed
back
on
a
question
about
whether
the
complaint
involved
discussions
about
former
vice
president
and
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
discussed
but
i
will
say
this
somebody
ought
to
look
into
joe
biden's
statement
because
it
was
disgraceful
where
he
talked
about
billions
of
dollars
that
he's
not
giving
to
a
certain
country
unless
certain
prosecutors
are
taken
off
the
case
trump
said
the
president
was
apparently
referring
to
an
erroneous
internet
meme
which
claimed
biden
threatened
to
cut
off
billion
in
aid
to
ukraine
if
the
country
did
not
fire
a
prosecutor
allegedly
looking
into
a
gas
company
where
his
son
was
an
executive
however
politifact
found
no
evidence
that
the
former
vice
president
threatened
to
cut
off
aid
in
his
son's
interest
instead
the
site
said
biden
urged
ukraine
to
fire
its
prosecutor
or
risk
losing
aid
because
that
was
the
wider
u.s.
government's
position
the
gas
company
was
not
under
investigation
trump
also
ripped
the
report
in
a
tweet
friday
morning
tweeting
that
the
radical
left
democrats
and
their
fake
news
media
partners
headed
up
again
by
little
adam
schiff
were
at
it
again
the
newspaper
first
reported
this
week
that
the
complaint
was
made
by
an
intelligence
officer
troubled
by
a
promise
trump
had
made
during
communication
and
interaction
with
a
foreign
leader
a
former
u.s.
intelligence
official
familiar
with
the
matter
confirmed
to
nbc
news
wednesday
night
that
the
whistleblower
complaint
involves
a
phone
conversation
that
trump
had
two
and
a
half
weeks
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
was
filed
trump
spoke
with
ukraine's
new
president
volodymyr
zelensky
the
post
reported
house
democrats
announced
last
week
that
they
will
investigate
the
role
of
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
in
what
they
characterized
as
efforts
to
influence
the
government
of
ukraine
to
help
the
trump
re-election
campaign
the
post's
editorial
board
on
sept
had
suggested
that
trump
was
withholding
military
aid
to
ukraine
to
pressure
it
to
investigate
joe
biden
and
his
son
hunter
biden
who
is
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
in
a
combative
interview
with
cnn
on
thursday
giuliani
initially
denied
being
in
touch
with
ukraine
officials
about
the
former
vice
president
but
minutes
later
he
appeared
to
contradict
himself
after
anchor
chris
cuomo
repeated
the
question
asking
so
you
did
ask
ukraine
to
look
into
joe
biden
of
course
i
did
giuliani
said
the
new
york
times
reported
thursday
that
the
details
of
the
allegation
remain
opaque
but
involve
at
least
one
instance
of
trump
making
an
unspecified
commitment
to
a
foreign
leader
and
include
other
actions
and
that
at
least
part
of
the
allegation
deals
with
ukraine
it
cited
interviews
and
two
people
familiar
with
the
complaint
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
been
withholding
the
whistleblower
complaint
from
house
intelligence
committees
download
the
nbc
news
app
for
breaking
news
and
politics
maguire's
decision
infuriated
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
who
has
demanded
maguire's
testimony
and
a
copy
of
the
complaint
the
inspector
general
for
the
intelligence
community
an
independent
watchdog
deemed
the
complaint
an
urgent
concern
that
he
was
required
by
law
to
turn
over
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
but
maguire
after
consulting
with
the
justice
department
overruled
him
according
to
a
series
of
letters
between
a
dni
lawyer
and
schiff
that
have
been
made
public
it
is
not
clear
from
the
post's
report
and
other
reporting
by
nbc
news
what
the
alleged
promise
to
a
foreign
leader
entailed
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
an
intelligence
official
about
a
private
presidential
phone
call
would
be
an
extraordinary
development
likely
without
precedent
in
u.s.
history
trump
on
thursday
disputed
reports
about
the
whistleblower
complaint
involving
communication
with
a
foreign
leader
calling
them
fake
news
he
said
that
when
he
speaks
on
the
phone
to
foreign
leaders
there
may
be
others
from
the
u.s.
listening
in
and
that
he
would
never
say
anything
inappropriate
to
a
foreign
leader
on
such
a
call
virtually
anytime
i
speak
on
the
phone
to
a
foreign
leader
i
understand
that
there
may
be
many
people
listening
from
various
u.s.
agencies
not
to
mention
those
from
the
other
country
itself
no
problem
trump
tweeted
knowing
all
of
this
is
anybody
dumb
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
say
something
inappropriate
with
a
foreign
leader
while
on
such
a
potentially
heavily
populated
call
i
would
only
do
what
is
right
anyway
and
only
do
good
for
the
usa
trump
continued
the
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
was
in
a
closed-door
briefing
with
members
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
for
several
hours
thursday
but
a
congressional
source
tells
nbc
news
that
atkinson
declined
to
reveal
to
lawmakers
the
substance
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
schiff
said
thursday
night
on
msnbc
after
the
post
published
its
report
that
we
haven't
received
the
complaint
and
did
not
confirm
that
it
involved
ukraine
he
said
that
the
dispute
between
the
dni
and
his
committee
is
not
one
over
policy
but
over
information
that
congress
has
a
right
to
know
this
involves
an
allegation
of
serious
wrongdoing
something
that
the
inspector
general
felt
needed
to
be
presented
to
congress
schiff
told
rachel
maddow
thursday
night
it
is
unprecedented
for
a
director
to
withhold
that
information
from
congress
schiff
said
if
whistleblowers
file
complaints
under
the
law
and
the
complaint
is
withheld
from
congress
he
said
it
could
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
system
and
that
important
information
about
wrongdoing
could
go
unreported
in
the
cnn
interview
giuliani
agreed
that
whistleblowers
deserve
protection
but
said
that
some
whistleblowers
are
liars
this
whistleblower
could
be
telling
the
truth
or
this
whistleblower
could
be
a
democrat
holdover
who
is
trying
to
destroy
donald
trump
