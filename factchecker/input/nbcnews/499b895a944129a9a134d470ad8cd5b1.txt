share
this
it
was
a
joke
says
tennessee
senator
who
said
colleges
should
be
banned
while
republican
kerry
roberts
said
colleges
should
be
banned
to
save
america
he
co-sponsored
legislation
this
year
to
promote
higher
education
a
state
senator
in
tennessee
on
monday
night
said
it
should
have
been
obvious
that
he
was
joking
when
he
suggested
that
higher
education
be
abolished
because
it's
a
liberal
breeding
ground
sen
kerry
roberts
a
republican
who
represents
a
suburban
district
north
and
west
of
nashville
was
discussing
a
legislative
session
on
an
abortion
measure
on
his
weekly
radio
show
last
week
when
he
recounted
a
diatribe
that
he
said
was
delivered
by
a
woman
who
goes
off
on
white
lawmakers
the
woman
complained
that
we've
never
done
anything
for
black
people
roberts
said
on
wdbl-am
of
springfield
he
said
the
woman
accused
lawmakers
of
being
just
hate-filled
idiots
his
voice
rising
to
a
shout
roberts
said
if
there's
one
thing
that
we
can
do
to
save
america
today
it's
to
get
rid
of
our
institutions
of
higher
education
right
now
and
cut
the
liberal
breeding
ground
off
good
grief
roberts
didn't
identify
the
woman
or
indicate
how
he
knew
her
educational
background
but
he
added
this
is
a
woman
who
is
a
product
of
higher
education
she's
learned
all
of
this
stuff
that
flies
in
the
face
of
what
we
stand
for
as
a
country
and
here
we
are
as
legislators
paying
for
this
garbage
to
be
taught
to
our
children
the
remarks
went
unnoticed
until
monday
when
the
political
website
the
tennessee
holler
reported
them
and
an
associated
press
version
of
the
report
was
widely
circulated
on
social
media
and
amplified
by
political
news
and
commentary
sites
adopting
the
tone
of
a
patient
schoolteacher
roberts
said
on
facebook
on
monday
night
that
my
listeners
clearly
understood
the
humor
and
hyperbole
of
it
roberts
own
history
and
legislative
record
suggest
that
he
was
indeed
joking
according
to
his
senate
biography
roberts
received
a
bachelor's
degree
in
accounting
from
lipscomb
university
a
christian
college
near
nashville
in
during
this
legislative
session
roberts
co-sponsored
a
measure
to
develop
a
statewide
master
plan
to
foster
strategic
future
development
of
public
universities
community
colleges
and
colleges
of
applied
technology
the
measure
which
passed
the
senate
in
may
specified
that
state
prison
inmates
should
be
a
focus
population
in
order
to
increase
the
degree
attainment
of
such
individuals
hyperbole
exaggerated
statements
or
claims
not
meant
to
be
taken
literally
roberts
said
in
a
tweet
that
he
posted
about
the
same
time
as
he
posted
his
facebook
message
monday
night
especially
common
on
