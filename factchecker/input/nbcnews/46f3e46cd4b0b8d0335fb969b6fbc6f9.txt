share
this
the
student
debt
crisis
and
what
democratic
candidates
propose
doing
about
it
from
tuition-free
college
to
canceling
all
student
loans
at
once
contenders
have
a
variety
of
ideas
over
the
last
four
years
college
affordability
and
student
debt
have
taken
on
a
bigger
role
in
presidential
politics
but
how
to
deal
with
the
problem
is
still
a
contentious
issue
among
the
candidates
in
just
about
every
democrat
running
for
president
has
endorsed
one
of
a
variety
of
plans
to
make
at
least
some
public
colleges
or
technical
schools
tuition-free
or
debt-free
all
have
proposed
ways
to
reduce
or
even
cancel
student
debt
public
higher
education
institutions
are
run
by
state
and
local
governments
and
the
federal
government
is
limited
in
how
much
it
can
affect
their
decisions
a
plan
by
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
would
have
the
federal
government
pay
two-thirds
of
the
cost
of
free
tuition
about
billion
per
year
according
to
his
office's
estimate
and
put
states
on
the
hook
for
the
remaining
third
to
collect
the
funds
states
would
have
to
pledge
to
eliminate
tuition
and
fees
while
maintaining
their
current
funding
levels
for
education
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
has
put
forward
a
similar
plan
of
course
it's
possible
some
states
would
choose
not
to
participate
other
candidates
have
proposed
different
approaches
several
including
sens
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
kamala
harris
of
california
and
warren
are
signed
onto
a
bill
that
would
provide
matching
funds
to
states
that
commit
to
use
the
money
to
pursue
debt-free
public
college
for
students
to
help
them
graduate
without
taking
on
loans
still
others
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
have
backed
making
college
tuition-free
but
only
for
two-year
community
colleges
an
idea
president
barack
obama
proposed
on
student
debt
sanders
and
warren
again
represent
the
left
flank
of
the
party
warren
put
out
a
means-tested
plan
to
cancel
up
to
in
student
debt
per
individual
households
making
as
much
as
could
qualify
for
at
least
some
debt
cancellation
which
would
cover
percent
of
student
debt
holders
by
warren's
estimate
and
wipe
out
all
loans
for
percent
of
student
debt
holders
sanders
has
gone
even
further
proposing
a
wholesale
elimination
of
all
trillion
in
student
debt
at
once
financed
by
new
taxes
on
financial
transactions
warren
estimates
her
plan
would
remove
billion
of
debt
other
candidates
have
proposed
more
limited
changes
to
student
debt
like
allowing
people
to
refinance
loans
at
lower
rates
or
putting
new
limits
on
how
much
needs
to
be
paid
back
each
month
as
a
share
of
their
income
many
democratic
candidates
also
have
proposed
making
it
easier
to
discharge
student
loans
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
where
it's
harder
to
eliminate
in
comparison
to
other
kinds
of
debt
some
like
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
have
called
for
allowing
students
to
eliminate
debt
by
working
in
public
service
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
of
texas
has
called
for
canceling
all
student
debt
held
by
public
school
teachers
harris
has
a
plan
to
allow
people
who
start
a
business
in
underserved
communities
to
eliminate
their
debt
americans
looking
for
work
are
stuck
in
an
increasingly
difficult
spot
to
obtain
many
high-paying
jobs
they
need
a
college
education
or
technical
degree
but
the
costs
of
education
are
rising
and
total
student
debt
has
more
than
doubled
over
the
last
decade
this
situation
was
made
worse
by
the
great
recession
which
forced
many
state
governments
to
cut
education
budgets
and
raise
tuition
at
public
colleges
and
universities
to
make
up
for
a
decline
in
tax
revenue
with
job
opportunities
more
limited
during
the
recovery
many
students
were
saddled
with
a
combination
of
high
student
debt
and
relatively
low
wages
supporters
of
a
one-time
mass
cancellation
of
student
loans
argue
that
these
circumstances
created
a
unique
buildup
of
debt
that
is
preventing
younger
americans
from
buying
a
home
having
children
or
starting
new
businesses
by
removing
the
burden
they
argue
these
groups
would
be
free
to
spend
more
and
boost
the
economy
older
americans
who
are
increasingly
affected
by
student
debt
would
also
have
an
easier
path
to
retire
what
folks
need
to
understand
is
that
there
have
been
some
major
policy
mistakes
said
sara
goldrick-rab
professor
of
higher
education
policy
and
sociology
at
temple
university
and
an
advocate
for
tuition-free
college
and
debt
cancellation
it's
led
to
a
lot
of
people
being
in
bad
shape
proponents
of
debt
cancellation
have
also
made
the
case
that
it
would
help
close
the
racial
wealth
gap
in
america
since
black
and
latino
households
are
disproportionately
affected
by
student
debt
and
college
costs
many
of
the
candidates
also
propose
boosting
funding
for
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
and
minority-serving
institutions
even
as
many
college
graduates
are
struggling
though
the
overall
benefits
of
higher
education
are
still
clear
workers
with
college
degrees
on
average
earn
higher
wages
and
are
less
likely
to
be
unemployed
than
those
without
them
because
higher
education
has
become
a
prerequisite
for
so
many
good-paying
jobs
proponents
of
tuition-free
college
say
it
should
be
treated
similarly
to
k-
education
as
a
public
right
applying
the
benefits
broadly
across
a
wide
range
of
incomes
will
reinforce
that
idea
they
argue
and
help
build
political
traction
with
middle-class
voters
who
might
object
to
spending
exclusively
on
low-income
households
it
will
also
free
up
existing
state
and
federal
aid
to
provide
additional
help
to
low-income
students
with
costs
besides
tuition
such
as
housing
making
it
more
likely
they'll
be
able
to
attend
and
graduate
critics
of
tuition-free
college
and
broad
student
debt
cancellation
argue
that
the
benefits
will
flow
to
too
many
americans
who
are
relatively
well
off
and
that
the
money
would
be
better
spent
on
more
vulnerable
groups
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
summed
it
up
in
the
second
democratic
debate
saying
my
problem
with
some
of
these
plans
is
they
literally
would
pay
for
wealthy
kids
for
wall
street
kids
to
go
to
college
klobuchar
has
called
for
financing
tuition-free
two-year
degrees
which
would
be
more
likely
to
attract
lower
income
students
looking
to
improve
their
job
prospects
proposals
for
debt-free
college
also
touch
on
this
split
since
wealthier
families
would
presumably
require
less
aid
or
none
at
all
to
limit
their
loans
students
with
extremely
high
debt
or
even
more
would
benefit
the
most
in
raw
dollars
from
proposals
by
sanders
and
warren
to
eliminate
large
swaths
of
student
debt
at
once
but
they
may
be
the
least
in
need
of
that
assistance
since
they
tend
to
be
graduates
with
advanced
or
professional
degrees
which
account
for
percent
of
all
student
debt
a
graduate
with
in
debt
after
attending
an
ivy
league
law
school
may
look
bad
on
a
balance
sheet
but
their
long-term
outlook
tends
to
be
far
better
than
a
worker
who
is
struggling
to
pay
off
a
few
thousand
dollars
of
debt
after
dropping
out
of
community
college
there's
also
growing
concern
that
americans
without
a
college
degree
are
becoming
more
disconnected
from
the
economy
and
more
vulnerable
to
health
problems
addiction
and
suicide
some
candidates
have
suggested
that
investing
trillions
in
free
tuition
debt
cancellation
programs
could
divert
funding
and
attention
from
these
workers
we
can't
give
everyone
money
so
it's
a
question
of
to
whom
we
give
that
money
said
sandy
baum
a
senior
fellow
for
the
center
on
education
data
and
policy
at
the
urban
institute
discussing
mass
debt
cancellation
if
you
didn't
go
to
college
you
don't
get
money
if
you
went
for
a
little
while
and
borrowed
a
little
you
get
a
little
money
but
if
you
went
a
long
time
and
got
a
good
degree
you
get
politically
some
candidates
like
buttigieg
have
argued
that
a
one-time
debt
cancellation
would
be
unfair
and
stir
resentment
among
people
who
did
not
benefit
from
loan
cancellation
either
because
they
had
already
paid
off
their
debt
or
because
they
had
missed
the
cutoff
and
were
still
in
school
democrats
who
have
raised
these
concerns
have
gravitated
around
more
targeted
benefits
like
refinancing
student
loans
at
lower
rates
or
further
limiting
how
much
students
are
expected
to
pay
each
month
as
a
portion
of
their
income
president
donald
trump
has
also
put
forward
another
approach
with
the
white
house
proposing
rules
aimed
at
preventing
students
from
taking
out
more
student
loans
than
they
can
afford
while
also
consolidating
repayment
options
to
make
the
process
less
confusing
critics
argue
the
plan
could
close
off
low-income
students
from
pursuing
advanced
degrees
that
require
greater
loans
