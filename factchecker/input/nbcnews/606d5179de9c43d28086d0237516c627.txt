sens
mike

is
serious

concentration
hawley

pressed
zuckerberg
about
political
bias
a
frequent
complaint
in
conservative
online
circles
we
also
talked
about
the
censorship
issue
and
i
just
want
to
underscore
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
censorship
and
political
bias
issue
is
so
pressing
is
because
facebook
is
so
big
it's
because
they
are
monopoly
size

missouri
senator
told
reporters
despite
trump's
past
criticism
of

continued
paying
big
bucks
to
advertise
on

over
million
between

than
million
ads
