this
trump
suggests
he
tied
ukraine
funding
to
corruption
cites
biden
allegations
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
corrupt
the
president
asked
monday
when
asked
what
he
had
spoken
about
during
his
summer
call
with
ukraine's
leader
president
donald
trump
on
monday
said
he
had
tied
vital
funding
for
ukraine
to
that
country's
handling
of
corruption
which
he
has
alleged
vice
president
joe
biden's
family
was
engaged
in
there
before
denying
just
hours
later
he'd
made
any
such
demand
we
want
to
make
sure
that
country
is
honest
it's
very
important
to
talk
about
corruption
if
you
don't
talk
about
corruption
why
would
you
give
money
to
a
country
that
you
think
is
corrupt
trump
told
reporters
monday
morning
in
new
york
when
asked
what
he
had
spoken
about
with
ukraine's
new
president
in
a
july
phone
call
it's
very
important
that
on
occasion
you
speak
to
somebody
about
corruption
he
said
moments
after
telling
journalists
let
me
just
tell
you
let
me
just
tell
you
what
biden
did
was
wrong
but
later
in
the
day
during
a
meeting
with
the
polish
president
trump
denied
that
he
told
zelensky
that
ukraine
could
only
have
the
military
aid
they
were
seeking
if
they
investigated
the
biden
family
i
put
no
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
i
could
have
i
think
it
would
probably
possibly
have
been
ok
if
i
did
but
i
didn't
i
didn't
put
any
pressure
on
them
whatsoever
trump
said
i
did
not
make
a
statement
that
you
have
to
do
this
or
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
aid
i
wouldn't
do
that
i
wouldn't
do
that
he
also
said
with
that
being
said
what
i
want
is
i
want
you
know
we're
giving
a
lot
of
money
away
to
ukraine
and
other
places
you
want
to
see
a
country
that's
going
to
be
not
corrupt
he
then
accused
the
media
of
having
a
double
standard
on
coverage
of
corruption
claims
if
a
republican
did
what
joe
biden
did
if
a
republican
ever
said
what
joe
biden
said
they
would
be
getting
the
electric
chair
by
right
now
he
said
look
at
the
double
standards
you
people
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
trump
said
he
hoped
reporters
would
get
to
see
a
transcript
of
the
call
before
appearing
to
back
away
from
a
willingness
to
release
it
the
president
has
the
authority
to
release
that
information
i
hope
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
see
a
call
because
i
didn't
do
it
he
said
but
added
that
he
didn't
think
it
is
a
great
precedent
to
be
releasing
calls
with
foreign
countries
heads
of
foreign
countries
so
i
don't
think
it
is
a
great
precedent
so
i
didn't
say
that
i
was
going
to
release
it
at
all
trump's
conversation
with
zelensky
has
come
under
sharp
scrutiny
following
a
whistleblower
complaint
by
a
member
of
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
that
multiple
outlets
reported
was
tied
to
the
summer
call
between
the
two
leaders
the
wall
street
journal
and
others
have
reported
that
trump
pressed
the
new
ukrainian
leader
to
investigate
the
business
dealings
of
biden's
son
hunter
in
ukraine
and
whether
they
affected
the
former
vice
president's
diplomatic
efforts
for
months
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
have
sought
to
pressure
ukraine
to
investigate
biden
one
of
the
president's
leading
challengers
in
giuliani
told
fox
business
on
monday
that
he
couldn't
be
percent
certain
the
president
didn't
threaten
to
cut
off
military
aid
to
ukraine
during
the
july
phone
with
zelensky
did
the
president
threaten
to
cut
off
aid
to
the
ukraine
fox
business
host
maria
bartiromo
asked
giuliani
no
no
that
was
a
false
story
he
responded
one
hundred
percent
she
replied
well
i
can't
tell
you
if
it's
percent
giuliani
said
because
the
phone
call
occurred
while
ukraine
was
awaiting
military
aid
from
the
u.s.
critics
have
raised
the
possibility
trump
was
attempting
a
quid
pro
quo
arrangement
in
the
weeks
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
became
public
the
trump
administration
froze
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
for
unclear
reasons
then
just
before
democrats
revealed
the
existence
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
administration
released
the
hold
on
ukrainian
military
aid
and
pitched
in
an
additional
million
the
controversy
has
sparked
a
new
round
of
calls
for
impeachment
by
democrats
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
sunday
assailed
the
trump
administration's
efforts
to
block
a
whistleblower
complaint
involving
trump's
apparent
effort
to
have
ukraine
investigate
biden
and
hunter
biden's
role
at
a
ukrainian
energy
company
family
in
a
letter
to
colleagues
pelosi
said
the
administration
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
if
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
fails
to
provide
the
complaint
when
he
testifies
in
front
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
thursday
the
complaint
reportedly
centers
around
trump's
july
conversation
with
zelensky
it's
just
a
democrat
witch
hunt
trump
said
on
monday
here
we
go
again
speaking
to
reporters
sunday
morning
trump
denied
anything
improper
but
said
he
did
discuss
biden
with
zelensky
in
the
july
phone
call
no
quid
pro
quo
there
was
nothing
trump
told
reporters
on
the
white
house
south
lawn
it
was
a
perfect
conversation
the
conversation
i
had
was
largely
congratulatory
with
largely
corruption
all
of
the
corruption
taking
place
and
largely
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine
and
ukraine
has
got
a
lot
of
problems
he
added
speaking
to
reporters
later
on
sunday
in
texas
trump
said
i
know
when
i
give
pressure
on
saturday
ukrainian
foreign
minister
vadym
prystaiko
said
he
didn't
think
trump
pressured
zelensky
during
the
phone
call
trump
and
zelensky
are
set
to
meet
face
to
face
on
wednesday
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
session
in
new
york
trump
and
giuliani's
monthslong
effort
to
get
ukraine
to
further
investigate
biden
and
his
son
an
effort
aided
by
the
state
department
centers
on
biden's
call
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
that
included
a
call
to
remove
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
one
of
the
cases
that
shokin
was
investigating
involved
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
at
the
time
included
biden's
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
politifact
meanwhile
reported
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
