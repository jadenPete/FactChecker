good
afternoon
last
tuesday
we
observed
the
anniversary
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
on
september
th
sadly
on
that
day
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
formally
notified
the
congress
that
the
administration
was
forbidding
him
from
turning
over
a
whistleblower
complaint
on
constitution
day
this
is
a
violation
of
the
law
shortly
thereafter
press
reports
began
to
break
of
a
phone
call
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
calling
upon
a
foreign
power
to
intervene
in
his
election
this
is
a
breach
of
his
constitutional
responsibilities
the
facts
are
these
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
who
was
appointed
by
president
trump
determined
that
the
complaint
is
both
of
urgent
concern
and
credible
and
its
disclosure
he
went
on
to
say
relates
to
one
of
the
most
significant
and
important
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
responsibility
to
the
american
people
on
thursday
the
inspector
general
testified
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
stating
that
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
barred
him
from
disclosing
the
whistleblower
complaint
this
is
a
violation
of
law
the
law
is
unequivocal
the
dni
staff
it
says
the
dni
dni
director
of
national
intelligence
shall
provide
congress
the
full
whistleblower
complaint
for
more
than
years
i've
served
on
the
intelligence
committee
as
a
member
as
the
ranking
member
as
part
of
the
gang
of
four
even
before
i
was
in
the
leadership
i
was
there
when
we
created
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
that
did
not
exist
before
i
was
there
even
earlier
in
the
s
when
we
wrote
the
whistleblower
laws
and
continue
to
write
them
to
improve
them
to
ensure
the
security
of
our
intelligence
and
the
safety
of
our
whistleblowers
i
know
what
their
purpose
was
and
we
proceeded
with
balance
and
caution
as
we
wrote
the
laws
i
can
say
with
authority
the
trump
administration's
actions
undermine
both
our
national
security
and
our
intelligence
and
our
protections
of
the
whistleblowers
more
than
both
this
thursday
the
acting
dni
will
appear
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
at
that
time
he
must
turn
over
the
whistleblower's
full
complaint
to
the
committee
he
will
have
to
choose
whether
to
break
the
law
or
honor
his
responsibility
to
the
constitution
on
the
final
day
of
the
constitutional
convention
in
when
our
constitution
was
adopted
americans
gathered
on
the
steps
of
independence
hall
to
await
the
news
of
a
government
our
founders
had
crafted
they
asked
benjamin
franklin
what
do
we
have
a
republic
or
a
monarchy
franklin
replied
a
republic
if
you
can
keep
it
our
responsibility
is
to
keep
it
our
public
endures
because
of
the
wisdom
of
our
constitution
enshrined
in
three
co-equal
branches
of
government
serving
as
checks
and
balances
on
each
other
the
actions
taken
to
date
by
the
president
have
seriously
violated
the
constitution
especially
when
the
president
says
article
ii
says
i
can
do
whatever
i
want
for
the
past
several
months
we
have
been
investigating
in
our
committees
and
litigating
in
the
courts
so
the
house
can
gather
all
of
the
relevant
facts
and
consider
whether
to
exercise
its
full
article
i
powers
including
a
constitutional
power
of
the
utmost
gravity
approval
of
articles
of
impeachment
and
this
week
the
president
has
admitted
to
asking
the
president
of
ukraine
to
take
actions
which
would
benefit
him
politically
the
action
of
the
trump
the
actions
of
the
trump
presidency
revealed
a
dishonorable
fact
of
the
president's
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
betrayal
of
our
national
security
and
betrayal
of
the
integrity
of
our
elections
therefore
today
i'm
announcing
the
house
of
representatives
moving
forward
with
an
official
impeachment
inquiry
i
am
directing
our
six
committees
to
proceed
with
their
investigations
under
that
umbrella
of
impeachment
inquiry
the
president
must
be
held
accountable
no
one
is
above
the
law
getting
back
to
our
founders
in
the
darkest
days
of
the
american
revolution
thomas
paine
wrote
that
times
have
found
us
that
times
found
them
to
fight
for
and
establish
our
democracy
the
times
have
found
us
today
not
to
place
ourselves
in
the
same
category
of
greatness
as
our
founders
but
to
place
us
in
the
urgency
of
protecting
and
defending
our
constitution
from
all
enemies
foreign
and
domestic
in
the
words
of
ben

thank
you
all
shortly
before
pelosi's
public
remarks
she
made
a
statement
in
a
meeting
with
her
caucus
read
those
remarks
below
now
let
me
just
put
you
in
a
place
i
assume
that
you
all
know
this
but
just
to
confirm
last
tuesday
was
constitution
day
constitution
day
the
day
we
observe
and
honor
our
constitution
sadly
on
that
day
was
the
day
that
news
broke
because
of
our
leadership
of
chairman
schiff
of
what
the
republicans
were
doing
now
here
it
is
there
is
a
complaint
from
a
whistleblower
about
a
conversation
that
the
president
had
on
the
phone
with
a
foreign
leader
we
know
of
at
least
one
example
and
that
is
ukraine
the
dna
the
dni
blocked
by
the
administration
has
chosen
to
break
the
law
the
law
is
very
clear
it
says
shall
just
as
it
does
in
the
taxes
it
says
shall
it
doesn't
say
may
should
could
shall
the
law
is
clear
there
is
no
question
president
trump
has
admitted
that
he
brought
up
the
investigation
of
the
biden
family
in
his
call
he
is
asking
a
foreign
government
to
help
him
in
his
campaign
that
is
a
betrayal
of
his
our
national
security
and
a
betrayal
of
the
integrity
of
our
elections
that
is
that
is
really
the
essence
of
it
now
all
of
the
work
that
has
been
done
before
by
our
chairman
and
i
commend
them
and
we
had
ourselves
on
a
path
seeking
the
truth
there
and
that
work
must
still
go
on
however
if
none
of
that
had
ever
occurred
what
has
happened
this
past
week
is
grievous
and
serious
with
our
constitution
and
so
we
must
it
is
understandable
to
the
public
it
has
clarity
in
terms
of
what
he
did
but
the
quid
pro
quo
don't
get
caught
in
the
trap
of
oh
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
no
he
asked
for
assistance
from
the
foreign
government
that's
wrong
but
it
would
be
my
intention
with
the
consent
of
this
caucus
to
go
forward
in
saying
what
the
president
has
done
and
his
betrayal
of
the
constitution
challenges
us
to
proceed
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
so
the
committees
are
tasked
to
do
their
work
under
an
impeachment
inquiry
under
oath
but
right
now
we
have
to
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
this
is
a
national
security
issue
and
we
cannot
let
him
think
that
this
is
a
casual
thing
so
that's
where
i'm
at
so
i
know
what
the
intent
of
the
law
was
and
what
the
intent
of
the
law
was
to
secure
in
cases
like
this
to
secure
our
intelligence
and
to
protect
our
whistleblowers
let
me
just
tell
you
this
i
had
a
conversation
with
the
president
this
morning
he
said
you
know
i
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
that
i
said
well
then
undo
it
undo
it
because
you
are
asking
the
dni
to
break
the
law
i
mean
it's
just
outrageous
in
any
event
our
messaging
is
the
president
admits
to
this
he
doesn't
even
see
anything
wrong
with
asking
a
foreign
government
for
aid
the
president
admits
to
this
he
has
taken
this
to
another
place
of
betrayal
of
his
oath
of
office
our
foreign
policy
our
national
security
and
the
integrity
of
our
elections
therefore
we
are
moving
forward
with
this
inquiry
and
we
want
this
to
be
done
expeditiously
expeditiously
our
founders
understood
that
there
could
be
some
abuse
of
powers
they
built
guardrails
into
the
constitution
they
never
suspected
that
a
president
could
undo
the
nor
did
we
when
we
were
writing
our
bill
on
whistleblowers
and
dni
ever
expect
that
the
director
of
national
intelligence
would
disobey
the
law
