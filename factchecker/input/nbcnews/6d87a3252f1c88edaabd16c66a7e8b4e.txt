they're
the
best
trump
says
he
can't
help
it
that
pence
other
officials
stay
at
his
hotels
pence's
chief
of
staff
told
reporters
trump
suggested
the
vice
president
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
trump
denied
that
president
donald
trump
told
reporters
wednesday
that
he
had
no
involvement
with
vice
president
mike
pence's
decision
to
stay
at
his
golf
resort
near
doonbeg
ireland
adding
people
like
my
product
what
can
i
tell
you
well
i
had
no
involvement
other
than
it's
a
great
place
trump
told
reporters
in
the
oval
office
before
explaining
that
pence's
family
hails
from
that
area
which
is
really
amazing
but
from
what
i
understood
he
was
going
there
trump
said
then
i
heard
he
was
going
there
but
i
didn't
it
wasn't
my
idea
for
mike
to
go
there
mike
went
there
because
his
family's
there
that's
my
understanding
of
it
pressed
on
whether
he
suggested
pence
stay
at
the
hotel
as
the
vice
president's
chief
of
staff
told
reporters
tuesday
trump
said
he
did
not
no
i
didn't
the
president
said
i
don't
suggest
anything
i
don't
suggest
it
nor
did
i
with
the
attorney
general
i
never
spoke
to
the
attorney
general
about
using
my
hotel
referring
to
reports
that
attorney
general
william
barr
has
booked
a
holiday
party
at
trump
international
hotel
in
washington
d.c.
in
december
i
have
a
lot
of
hotels
all
over
the
place
and
people
use
them
because
they're
the
best
trump
said
and
i
know
the
attorney
general
is
using
it
as
i
read
in
the
paper
to
this
day
i
haven't
spoken
to
him
about
it
but
he's
using
the
hotel
and
people
like
my
product
what
can
i
tell
you
can't
help
it
i
guess
they
said
we
want
to
stay
at
a
place
that's
better
than
someplace
else
the
president
continued
but
with
mike
pence
i
never
spoke
about
it
and
with
bill
i
never
spoke
about
attorney
general
barr
we
never
spoke
about
it
but
that's
what
they
choose
trump's
comments
followed
efforts
by
pence's
office
earlier
in
the
day
to
distance
the
president
from
the
vice
president's
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
during
his
visit
to
ireland
in
a
statement
the
vice
president's
office
said
trump
did
not
direct
the
vice
president
to
stay
at
the
golf
club
and
the
decision
was
solely
made
by
pence's
office
the
statement
was
the
third
time
within
the
past
day
that
pence
or
his
team
sought
to
clarify
why
he
stayed
at
the
president's
irish
golf
club
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
country
as
its
capital
city
dublin
where
pence's
meetings
were
set
to
take
place
with
irish
officials
rather
than
stay
in
dublin
pence
opted
to
make
the
back-and-forth
trip
from
doonbeg
more
than
an
hour
flight
each
way
pence's
stay
has
revived
accusations
that
trump
is
personally
profiting
from
being
president
through
use
of
his
hotel
in
washington
mar-a-lago
in
palm
beach
florida
and
other
properties
originally
pence
who
is
traveling
with
his
wife
sister
and
mother
was
set
to
conclude
his
european
trip
in
doonbeg
where
he
has
familial
ties
his
schedule
changed
as
a
result
of
trump
canceling
his
european
travel
because
of
hurricane
dorian
because
of
some
misreporting
we
want
to
clarify
that
the
decision
to
stay
at
trump
national
in
doonbeg
ireland
was
solely
a
decision
by
the
office
of
the
vice
president
and
was
based
on
the
requirement
to
find
accommodations
near
the
vice
president's
ancestral
hometown
that
could
satisfy
official
meetings
on
both
coasts
of
the
emerald
isle
the
statement
said
the
vice
president's
family
previously
stayed
at
the
same
resort
in
prior
to
the
trump
organization's
acquisition
of
the
property
and
the
office
was
aware
of
its
proximity
to
the
ancestral
home
where
his
great
grandmother
lived
before
migrating
to
the
united
states
it
continued
our
original
schedule
contemplated
one
night
in
doonbeg
after
official
meetings
in
dublin
when
hurricane
dorian
required
our
office
to
change
the
schedule
on
short
notice
the
decision
was
made
to
overnight
in
doonbeg
for
two
nights
to
accommodate
official
business
and
public
events
on
both
coasts
at
no
time
did
the
president
direct
our
office
to
stay
at
his
doonbeg
resort
and
any
reporting
to
the
contrary
is
false
on
tuesday
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
said
trump
had
suggested
pence
stay
at
his
irish
golf
club
on
the
official
trip
i
don't
think
it
was
a
request
like
a
command
i
think
that
it
was
a
suggestion
it's
like
when
we
went
through
the
trip
it's
like
well
he's
going
to
doonbeg
because
that's
where
the
pence
family
is
from
short
said
before
describing
the
president's
suggestion
it's
like
well
you
should
stay
at
my
place
it
wasn't
like
a
you
must
short
added
it
wasn't
like
you
have
to
it's
a
facility
that
could
accommodate
the
team
keep
in
mind
the
secret
service
has
protected
that
facility
for
him
too
so
they
sort
of
know
the
realities
they
know
the
logistics
around
that
facility
after
speaking
to
reporters
short
told
a
new
york
times
reporter
that
pence
is
personally
paying
all
family
expenses
later
in
the
day
pence
said
it
was
a
necessity
to
stay
at
trump
doonbeg
in
order
to
accommodate
the
unique
footprint
that
comes
with
our
security
detail
and
other
personnel
the
vice
president
called
the
decision
logical
we
checked
it
with
the
state
department
pence
added
they
approved
us
staying
there
the
president
has
come
under
scrutiny
for
using
taxpayer
dollars
at
his
properties
he
even
suggested
last
month
that
next
year's
g-
summit
should
be
hosted
at
his
miami
golf
resort
insisting
he
would
not
profit
off
such
a
venture
the
president
has
spent
roughly
days
at
trump
properties
since
taking
office
according
to
an
nbc
news
count
ahead
of
his
inauguration
trump
chose
to
turn
control
of
his
company
over
to
his
two
adult
sons
and
a
senior
trump
organization
executive
rather
than
divest
from
his
large
portfolio
