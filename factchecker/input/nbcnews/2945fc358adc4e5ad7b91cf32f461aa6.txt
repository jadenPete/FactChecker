with

powers
unravels
under
pressure
from

pull

and
re-impose

rouhani's
highly
anticipated
remarks
at
the
u.n.
came
a
day
after
trump
described
iran
as
one
of
the
greatest
threats
to
the
planet
the
escalating
crisis
has
raised
concerns
that
direct
conflict
with
iran
at
the
center
could
break
out
in
the
region
a
scenario
that
all
concerned
parties
including
iran
and
saudi
arabia
have
stressed
they
want
to
avoid
the
united
states
has
sent
military
reinforcements
and
beefed
up
its
security
presence
in
the
middle
east
in
past
months
amid
the
rising
tensions
with
iran
rouhani's
manner
during
the
speech
was
measured
but
the
words
he
delivered
were
ominous
our
region
is
on
the
edge
of
collapse
as
a
single
blunder
can
fuel
a
big
fire
he
said
the
region
will
become
secure
when
u.s.
troops
withdraw
he
said
rouhani
spent
much
time
appealing
to
iran's
neighbors
saying
that
their
destinies
are
intertwined
and
they
should
consider
each
other
rather
than
pinning
their
hopes
on
the
involvement
of
the
united
states
security
shall
not
be
supplied
with
american
weapons
and
intervention
he
said
security
cannot
be
purchased
or
supplied
by
foreign
governments
rouhani's
remarks
come
as
the
u.s.
and
its
allies
accuse
iran
of
being
behind
a
major
drone-and-missile
strike
on
saudi
arabia's
key
oil
sites
earlier
this
month
iran
has
denied
any
involvement
and
says
any
strikes
by
the
u.s.
or
saudi
arabia
will
lead
to
all-out
war
the
sept
attack
followed
months
of
lower-level
attacks
on
oil
tankers
and
the
shooting
down
of
a
u.s.
surveillance
drone
over
the
strait
of
hormuz
the
u.s.
and
its
regional
allies
blame
those
attacks
on
iran
which
it
also
denies
trump
speaking
at
the
u.n.
on
tuesday
left
open
the
possibility
of
diplomatic
engagement
with
iran
that
was
the
same
day
that
rouhani
insisted
that
he'd
only
consider
meeting
after
sanctions
against
his
country
are
lifted
but
as
he
ended
his
general
assembly
speech
rouhani
suggested
there
was
still
some
room
for
diplomacy
this
is
the
message
of
the
iranian
nation
let's
invest
on
hope
toward
a
better
future
rather
than
on
war
and
violence
he
said
let's
return
to
justice
to
peace
to
law
commitment
and
promise
and
finally
to
the
negotiating
table
