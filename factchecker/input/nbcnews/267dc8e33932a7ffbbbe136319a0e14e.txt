importantly
to
the
american
people
he
was
put
on
the

through
a
sham
process

his
place

days
of

new
allegations
tore
through
washington
on
sunday
with
many
democrats
calling
for
congress
to
take
action
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
tweeted
that
confirmation
is
not
exoneration
and
these
newest
revelations
are
disturbing
like
the
man
who
appointed
him
kavanaugh
should
be
impeached
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
also
a
presidential
hopeful
tweeted
that
the
revelations
today
confirm
what
we
already
knew
during
his
hearing
kavanaugh
faced
credible
accusations
and
likely
lied
to
congress
i
support
any
appropriate
constitutional
mechanism
to
hold
him
accountable
trump
lashed
out
at
the
new
reporting
calling
kavanaugh
an
innocent
man
he
is
an
innocent
man
who
has
been
treated
horribly
trump
said
on
twitter
referring
to
the
accusations
as
lies
the
president
also
accused
critics
of
attempting
to
influence
kavanaugh's
opinions
and
suggested
that
kavanaugh
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
kavanaugh
told
the
senate
judiciary
committee
under
oath
last
year
that
the
first
time
he
heard
of
ramirez's
allegation
was
in
a
sept
article
in
the
new
yorker
but
according
to
text
messages
obtained
last
year
by
nbc
news
in
the
days
leading
up
to
ramirez
public
allegation
kavanaugh
and
his
team
were
communicating
behind
the
scenes
with
friends
to
refute
the
claim
the
fbi
opened
an
expanded
background
investigation
into
kavanaugh
after
pressure
from
democrats
in
congress
initially
delayed
his
confirmation
process
but
dozens
of
people
with
potential
information
into
the
allegations
against
him
were
not
contacted
according
to
multiple
sources
that
include
friends
of
both
the
nominee
and
his
accusers
sen
mazie
hirono
d-hawaii
who
grilled
kavanaugh
during
his
confirmation
hearing
said
on
sunday
that
the
new
reporting
is
more
proof
that
brett
kavanaugh
should
never
have
been
confirmed
to
the
supreme
court
it
was
plain
to
me
and
many
others
at
the
time
that
the
fbi
investigation
into
the
serious
corroborated
allegations
of
sexual
assault
by
justice
kavanaugh
was
a
sham
the
house
judiciary
committee
should
immediately
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry
to
determine
whether
justice
kavanaugh
lied
to
congress
and
why
the
fbi
wasn't
permitted
to
investigate
all
credible
allegations
against
him
she
added
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
defended
kavanaugh
on
sunday
tweeting
the
far
left's
willingness
to
seize
on
completely
uncorroborated
and
unsubstantiated
allegations
during
last
year's
confirmation
process
was
a
dark
and
embarrassing
chapter
for
the
senate
fortunately
a
majority
of
senators
and
the
american
people
rallied
behind
timeless
principles
such
as
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
he
wrote
i
look
forward
to
many
years
of
service
to
come
from
justice
kavanaugh
