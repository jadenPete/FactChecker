omar
defends
comments
after
criticism
from
mourner
i
think
it
is
really
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we
are
not
forgetting
right
the
aftermath
of
what
happened
after
omar
said
rep
ilhan
omar
d-minn
sought
on
sunday
to
clarify
a
comment
she
made
about
the
september
th
terror
attacks
after
one
mourner
referenced
the
remark
during
a
memorial
event
this
week
was
an
attack
on
all
americans
omar
told
cbs's
face
the
nation
it
was
an
attack
on
all
of
us
and
i
certainly
could
not
understand
the
weight
of
the
pain
that
the
victims
of
the
families
of
must
feel
but
i
think
it
is
really
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we
are
not
forgetting
right
the
aftermath
of
what
happened
after
many
americans
found
themselves
now
having
their
civil
rights
stripped
from
them
she
continued
and
so
what
i
was
speaking
to
was
the
fact
that
as
a
muslim
not
only
was
i
suffering
as
an
american
who
was
attacked
on
that
day
but
the
next
day
i
woke
up
as
my
fellow
americans
were
now
treating
me
a
suspect
at
a
manhattan
memorial
commemorating
the
anniversary
of
the
attacks
on
wednesday
nicholas
haros
jr
of
new
jersey
took
the
stage
wearing
a
t-shirt
emblazoned
with
some
people
did
something
highlighting
a
past
remark
from
omar
today
i
am
here
to
respond
to
you
exactly
who
did
what
to
whom
haros
who
lost
his
mother
francis
haros
in
the
attack
said
we
know
who
and
what
was
done
there's
no
uncertainty
about
that
haros
also
called
out
the
rest
of
the
squad
a
group
of
progressive
freshman
congresswomen
of
color
that
include
reps
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
and
ayanna
pressley
d-mass
and
omar
our
constitutional
freedoms
were
attacked
and
our
nation's
founding
on
judeo-christian
principles
were
attacked
haros
said
that's
what
some
people
did
got
that
now
we
are
here
today
congresswoman
to
tell
you
and
the
squad
just
who
did
what
to
whom
during
a
march
speech
at
a
council
on
american-islamic
relations
cair
event
omar
highlighted
how
many
american
muslims
saw
their
civil
liberties
curtailed
in
the
aftermath
of
the
attacks
here's
the
truth
omar
said
for
far
too
long
we
have
lived
with
the
discomfort
of
being
a
second-class
citizen
and
frankly
i'm
tired
of
it
and
every
single
muslim
in
this
country
should
be
tired
of
it
cair
was
founded
after
because
they
recognized
that
some
people
did
something
and
that
all
of
us
were
starting
to
lose
access
to
our
civil
liberties
so
you
can't
just
say
that
today
someone
is
looking
at
me
strange
and
that
i
am
trying
to
make
myself
look
pleasant
she
added
you
have
to
say
that
this
person
is
looking
at
me
strange
i
am
not
comfortable
with
it
and
i
am
going
to
talk
to
them
and
ask
them
why
because
that
is
the
right
you
have
a
representative
for
omar
later
said
she
misspoke
about
cair's
founding
the
organization
was
established
in
but
expanded
its
civil
rights
advocacy
after
on
wednesday
omar
tweeted
september
th
was
an
attack
on
all
of
us
we
will
never
forget
the
thousands
of
americans
who
lost
their
lives
in
the
largest
terror
attack
on
u.s.
soil
