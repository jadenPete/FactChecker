to
discussing

scrutinized
talk
with
ukrainian
leader
no

there
was

trump
said
the
call
it
was
a
perfect
conversation
president
donald
trump
on
sunday
acknowledged
that
he
discussed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
during
a
july
phone
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
but
denied
accusations
that
he
is
using
the
power
of
his
office
to
hurt
a
major
political
rival
no
quid
pro
quo
there
was
nothing
trump
told
reporters
on
the
white
house
south
lawn
it
was
a
perfect
conversation
the
phone
call
has
ignited
a
political
maelstrom
in
washington
this
week
as
the
latest
revelation
about
a
months-long
effort
to
get
ukraine
to
investigate
biden
who
is
running
for
president
against
trump
and
his
son
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
and
other
outlets
trump
pressed
the
new
ukrainian
leader
to
investigate
hunter
biden's
business
dealings
in
ukraine
and
whether
they
affected
the
former
vice
president's
diplomatic
efforts
because
the
phone
call
occurred
while
ukraine
was
still
awaiting
military
aid
from
the
u.s.
critics
have
raised
the
possibility
that
trump
was
attempting
a
quid
pro
quo
arrangement
i'm
not
looking
to
hurt
biden
or
even
hold
him
to
it
trump
said
on
sunday
adding
now
me
on
the
other
hand
my
conversation
with
the
new
president
of
ukraine
was
perfect
trump
said
that
while
he
discussed
the
bidens
on
the
phone
call
there
was
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
the
conversation
the
conversation
i
had
was
largely
congratulatory
with
largely
corruption
all
of
the
corruption
taking
place
and
largely
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine
and
ukraine
has
got
a
lot
of
problems
the
new
president
is
saying
that
he's
going
to
be
able
to
rid
the
country
of
corruption
and
i
said
that
would
be
a
great
thing
we
had
a
great
conversation
speaking
to
reporters
later
on
sunday
in
texas
trump
said
he
might
provide
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
a
respected
source
adding
everyone
will
say
the
conversation
between
him
and
ukraine's
president
was
perfectly
fine
i
know
when
i
give
pressure
trump
said
trump
weighed
in
again
sunday
night
with
a
pair
of
tweets
disputing
the
journal
report
and
describing
his
call
with
the
ukrainian
leader
as
nice
the
phone
call
reportedly
led
to
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
within
the
intelligence
community
the
existence
of
which
was
first
revealed
earlier
this
month
the
washington
post
reported
on
wednesday
that
the
complaint
centered
around
a
promise
that
trump
made
to
a
foreign
leader
over
the
next
few
days
the
post
and
other
media
outlets
reported
that
the
complaint
involved
ukraine
the
president's
focus
on
biden
and
ukraine
comes
amid
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani's
months-long
effort
to
get
ukraine
to
further
investigate
the
former
vice
president
an
effort
which
was
aided
by
the
state
department
as
nbc
news
reported
last
month
the
push
centers
on
biden's
call
widely
backed
by
the
international
community
for
ukraine
to
crack
down
on
corruption
including
removing
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
was
seen
as
ineffective
and
was
later
removed
by
the
country's
parliament
one
of
the
cases
that
shokin
was
investigating
involved
burisma
holdings
a
natural
gas
company
whose
board
at
the
time
included
biden's
son
earlier
this
year
bloomberg
news
citing
documents
and
an
interview
with
a
former
ukrainian
official
reported
the
burisma
investigation
had
been
dormant
for
more
than
a
year
by
the
time
biden
called
for
the
crackdown
on
corruption
the
then-ukrainian
prosecutor
general
told
the
news
agency
that
he
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
and
his
son
politifact
meanwhile
reported
that
it
found
no
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
joe
biden
advocated
with
his
son's
interests
in
mind
giuliani
as
he's
noted
learned
of
the
biden
episode
through
his
efforts
to
have
ukraine
examine
whether
the
democratic
national
committee
worked
in
connection
with
ukrainian
officials
to
harm
trump's
campaign
by
releasing
damaging
information
on
the
president's
former
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
who
is
now
serving
a
lengthy
prison
sentence
as
part
of
mueller's
investigation
house
democrats
have
already
announced
an
investigation
into
giuliani's
ukrainian
efforts
in
a
cnn
interview
from
thursday
giuliani
denied
asking
ukrainian
officials
to
probe
biden
but
moments
later
said
of
course
i
did
on
wednesday
trump
is
set
to
meet
face
to
face
with
zelensky
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
in
the
weeks
before
the
whistleblower
complaint
became
public
the
trump
administration
froze
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
for
unclear
reasons
then
just
before
democrats
revealed
the
existence
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
administration
released
the
hold
on
ukrainian
military
aid
on
saturday
ukrainian
foreign
minister
vadym
prystaiko
said
he
didn't
think
trump
pressured
zelensky
a
former
comedian
during
their
july
phone
call
i
know
what
the
conversation
was
about
and
i
think
there
was
no
pressure
he
said
there
was
talk
conversations
are
different
leaders
have
the
right
to
discuss
any
problems
that
exist
this
conversation
was
long
friendly
and
it
touched
on
a
lot
of
questions
including
those
requiring
serious
answers
meanwhile
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
been
withholding
the
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
which
has
demanded
his
testimony
and
the
complaint
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
regarded
the
complaint
as
an
urgent
concern
that
the
law
required
him
to
provide
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
but
the
justice
department
ruled
the
complaint
did
not
need
to
be
turned
over
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
on
sunday
implored
maguire
to
release
the
complaint
saying
that
further
stonewalling
would
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
trump
spent
much
of
the
past
few
days
denying
any
wrongdoing
as
part
of
his
conversation
with
ukraine
initially
saying
thursday
that
he
knows
many
people
listen
into
his
phone
calls
asking
is
anybody
dumb
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
say
something
inappropriate
with
a
foreign
leader
while
on
such
a
potentially
heavily
populated
call
and
insisting
that
he
would
only
do
what
is
right
anyway
and
only
do
good
for
the
usa
on
saturday
though
the
president
appeared
to
question
whether
someone
on
the
phone
call
was
spying
on
him
quoting
analysis
from
a
fox
news
analyst
the
president
deemed
this
new
scandal
the
ukraine
witch
hunt
echoing
language
he
used
regarding
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
into
russian
interference
in
the
presidential
election
if
trump
or
associates
conspired
with
russian
officials
and
whether
trump
sought
to
obstruct
the
probe
democrats
have
been
up
in
arms
in
recent
days
about
the
allegations
speaking
to
reporters
in
iowa
on
saturday
biden
said
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
biden
called
trump
a
serial
abuser
whose
call
to
investigate
the
former
vice
president's
family
crosses
the
line
this
crosses
the
line
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
a
presidential
contender
said
in
iowa
saturday
that
trump
has
solicited
another
foreign
government
to
attack
our
election
system
it
is
time
for
us
to
call
out
this
illegal
behavior
and
start
impeachment
proceedings
right
now
and
on
twitter
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
said
at
this
point
the
bigger
national
scandal
isn't
the
president's
lawbreaking
behavior
it
is
the
democratic
party's
refusal
to
impeach
him
for
it
a
senior
aide
to
a
house
democrat
told
nbc
news
in
an
email
i
have
always
thought
that
the
pro-impeachment
crowd
made
a
big
tactical
mistake
by
focusing
on
pelosi
she
is
just
expressing
her
sense
of
what
the
caucus
has
the
votes
to
do
in
the
same
vein
the
crucial
question
with
ukraine
is
how
people
who
haven't
previously
supported
impeachment
feel
about
it
the
aide
added
ukraine
was
also
the
topic
of
the
day
on
sunday's
political
talk
shows
speaking
with
nbc's
meet
the
press
sen
pat
toomey
r-pa
said
congress
should
find
out
why
the
administration
withheld
aid
from
ukraine
adding
it
is
not
appropriate
for
any
candidate
to
ask
for
assistance
from
a
foreign
government
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
told
the
program
that
if
a
u.s.
president
is
asking
another
foreign
leader
to
interfere
in
an
american
election
then
there
has
to
be
consequences
regardless
of
if
there
was
a
direct
quid
pro
quo
