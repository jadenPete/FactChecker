problem
a
federal
judge
has
ruled
that
the
trump
administration
violated
the
law
by
failing
to
promptly
resolve
visa
applications
for
thousands
of
afghans
and
iraqis
who
worked
for
american
troops
and
diplomats
and
ordered

u.s.
district
court
judge
tanya
chutkan
of
washington
d.c.
said
the
government
offered
no
convincing
explanation
why
it
has
failed
to
abide
by
legislation
requiring
authorities
to
deliver
a
decision
on
visa
applications
for
afghans
and
iraqis
within
nine
months
instead
many
applicants
who
risked
their
lives
working
for
u.s.
troops
or
other
government
agencies
have
had
to
wait
for
several
years
to
get
an
answer
on
their
visa
requests
the
court
said
in
the
ruling
handed
down
on
friday
this
ruling
could
finally
bring
relief
to
these
men
and
women
and
their
families
who
have
been
waiting
in
fear
for
far
too
long

one
of
the
lawyers
who
argued
the
case
they
served
bravely
in
support
of
our
missions
abroad
and
we
promised
them
a
pathway
to
safety
in

this
ruling
ensures
that
we
keep
our
promise

said
calling
the
government's
arguments
untenable
the
court
ordered
the
trump
administration
to
produce
a
plan
within
days
on
how
it
plans
to
remedy
the
problem
with
the
visa
applications
a
state
department
official
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
on
the
record
said
we
are
aware
of
the
court's
decision
and
are
reviewing
with
our
colleagues
at
the
u.s.
department
of
justice
the
ruling
against
the
administration
came
as
the
white
house
weighs
how
many
refugees
including
former
iraqi
interpreters
to
admit
to
the
u.s.
in
the
next
fiscal
year
starting
in
october
the
pentagon
has
argued
against
further
reducing
refugee
admissions
that
are
already
at
historic
lows
and
cited
the
plight
of
iraqis
who
worked
with
u.s.
soldiers
and
diplomats
at
great
personal
risk
the
special
immigrant
visa
siv
program
was
set
up
to
help
iraqis
and
afghans
who
worked
for
u.s.
troops
or
diplomats
to
resettle
in
the
u.s.
but
the
program
has
been
plagued
by
delays
in
both
republican
and
democratic
administrations
frustrated
lawmakers
introduced
a
law
in
ordering
the
state
department
and
other
agencies
to
process
visa
applications
within
nine
months
and
to
report
back
to
congress
on
any
reason
for
delay
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
defendants
u.s.
government
an
unbounded
open-ended
timeframe
in
which
to
adjudicate
siv
applications
the
federal
judge
said
in
her
ruling
administration
lawyers
had
argued
in
court
that
evaluating
visa
applications
was
a
complex
task
and
officials
had
to
weigh
the
need
to
safeguard
national
security
and
not
only
the
deadline
imposed
by
congress
but
judge
chutkan
dismissed
the
administration's
argument
saying
the
law
adopted
by
congress
recognized
the
complexity
of
the
process
and
that
it
allowed
for
exceptions
in
cases
deemed
to
pose
a
high
risk
the
judge
wrote
that
the
fact
that
the
adjudication
process
is
a
complex
one
does
not
excuse
delays
of
such
magnitude
because
congress
explicitly
referenced
that
complexity
in
the
month
provision
documents
revealed
during
the
course
of
the
case
showed
virtually
all
siv
applicants
have
faced
delays
beyond
the
nine-month
limit
for
an
answer
on
their
visas
and
that
an
applicant
can
expect
about
a
four-year
wait
the
class
action
suit
was
filed
last
year
by
a
group
of
five
unnamed
afghans
and
iraqis
against
secretary
of
state
michael
pompeo
as
well
as
officials
leading
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
the
plaintiffs
had
said
they
were
forced
to
flee
their
homes
and
faced
death
threats
from
militants
due
to
their
work
with
the
u.s.
government
ryan
crocker
a
retired
senior
diplomat
and
former
ambassador
to
both
afghanistan
and
iraq
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
the
iraqi
and
afghan
plaintiffs
saying
failure
to
resolve
visa
applications
damaged
the
country's
national
security
interests
the
perception
that
our
country
cannot
or
will
not
honor
its
promises
to
those
who
have
risked
literally
everything
to
help
our
soldiers
and
diplomats
is
by
itself
an
irreparable
harm
to
our
operational
capacities
crocker
wrote
moreover
those
perceptions
have
already
become
a
propaganda
tool
that
will
certainly
risk
diminishing
our
ability
to
recruit
allies
in
future
conflicts
the
number
of
siv
visas
being
issued
has
declined
under
the
trump
administration
and
refugee
advocates
believe
it's
a
result
of
wider
restrictions
on
immigration
and
refugee
admissions
after
iraqis
could
no
longer
qualify
for
the
siv
program
and
now
have
to
apply
as
refugees
last
year
the
u.s.
government
only
admitted
two
former
iraqi
interpreters
despite
a
backlog
of
tens
of
thousands
nbc
news
previously
reported
members
of
congress
have
accused
the
administration
of
rebuffing
requests
for
information
on
why
applicants
are
in
limbo
and
several
lawmakers
have
raised
questions
about
the
case
of
one
afghan
interpreter
muhammad
kamran
who
has
been
denied
a
visa
despite
facing
death
threats
