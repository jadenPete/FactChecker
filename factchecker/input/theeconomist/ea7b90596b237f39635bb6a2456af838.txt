eduardo

one
of
the
litigants
in
nielsen
v
preap
came
to
america
in

convicted
for

conviction
mr
padilla
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
being
deported
to
mexico
a
country
he
left
when
he
was
months
old
the
question
the
justices
tackled
in
preap
was
how
to
interpret
a
law
of
requiring
the
detention
of
certain
immigrants
when
the
alien
is
released
from
criminal
custody
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
that
green-card
holders
may
not
be
nabbed
and
held
indefinitely
without
a
bail
hearing
long
after
being
released
the
law
the
appeals
court
said
permitted
ice
to
swoop
in
only
at
the
time
of
the
immigrant's
release
if
authorities
wanted
to
detain
an
alien
later
they
would
have
to
give
him
a
hearing
for
justice
samuel
alito
author
of
the
majority
in
the
latest
ruling
that
reading
is
hard
to
swallow
requiring
that
the
alien
must
be
arrested
on
the
day
he
walks
out
of
jail
unreasonably
constrains
ice
authority
he
says
the
law
would
amount
to
nonsense
if
it
were
understood
to
favour
mr
padilla
and
his
fellow
plaintiffs
mandatory
detention
would
be
downright
incoherent
if
it
did
not
require
the
detention
of
every
alien
who
has
committed
an
offence
listed
at
any
time
in
dissent
justice
stephen
breyer
wrote
that
the
case
concerns
basic
american
legal
values
it
has
consequences
for
green-card
holders
who
have
established
families
and
put
down
roots
in
a
community
the
ruling
threatens
to
deprive
people
of
their
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
and
to
strip
them
of
the
longstanding
right
of
virtually
all
persons
to
receive
a
bail

held
in

a

breyer

frames
a
long-running
disagreement
fuels
the
split
between
the
court's
liberals
and
conservatives
how
to
read
statutes
whereas
the
alito
majority
in
preap
takes
a
magnifying
glass
to
the
words
on
the
page
and
strives
to
understand
them
without
reference
to
anything
else
an
approach
known
as
textualism
the
breyer
dissent
takes
a
broader
view
considering
the
purposes
that
lie
behind
the
law
