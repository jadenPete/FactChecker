california's
teachers
strikes
conceal
a
conflict
of
generations
teachers
are
striking
over
pay
as
pensions
and
health-care
costs
are
eating
up
budgets
i
like
cats
unicorns
and
peace
but
i
love
my
teacher
declares
one
sign
with
two
rainbows
held
by
a
young
pupil
at
crocker
highlands
elementary
school
in
oakland
on
a
weekday
morning
she
should
have
been
at
school
but
instead
she
joined
her
mother
and
thousands
of
oakland's
teachers
outside
city
hall
oakland's
teachers
are
asking
for
higher
salaries
support
staff
and
more
teachers
in
nearby
sacramento
may
be
next
to
put
down
chalk
and
pick
up
placards
such
strikes
have
become
a
national
phenomenon
teachers
in
los
angeles
denver
and
west
virginia
have
gone
on
strike
this
year
after
action
in
arizona
colorado
kentucky
north
carolina
and
oklahoma
in
last
year
around
teachers
and
staff
went
on
strike
they
accounted
for
about
three-quarters
of
the
total
number
of
american
workers
who
downed
tools
as
a
result
saw
the
highest
number
of
workers
involved
in
strikes
since
the
complaints
differ
by
school
district
but
one
common
refrain
on
picket
lines
is
that
teachers
are
not
paid
enough
for
their
hard
work
the
wage
gap
between
teachers
and
similarly
educated
workers
has
certainly
widened
since
the
mid-
s
in
many
states
teachers
are
paid
less
than
other
public-sector
employees
such
as
prison
guards
and
police
officers
the
financial
crisis
a
decade
ago
caused
some
states
to
gut
spending
on
education
suppressing
teachers
wages
teachers
in
west
virginia
and
oklahoma
where
strikes
have
occurred
are
among
the
worst-paid
in
the
nation
in
parts
of
california
where
the
average
public-school
teacher
earns
what
might
appear
to
be
a
plum
salary
of
around
a
third
higher
than
the
national
average
the
cost
of
living
is
an
animating
issue
many
teachers
struggle
to
live
without
room-shares
and
within
an
hour's
commute
of
their
schools
a
supreme
court
decision
has
also
played
a
part
unions
are
particularly
intent
on
proving
their
value
to
members
after
janus
v
american
federation
of
state
county
and
municipal
employees
deemed
it
illegal
to
compel
union
dues
from
public
employees
the
strikes
have
helped
unions
re-establish
their
relevance
for
younger
members
after
the
janus
case
says
andy
rotherham
of
bellwether
education
partners
a
non-profit
finally
the
continued
rise
of
charter
schools
is
also
fuelling
protests
in
around
of
all
american
pupils
attended
a
charter
school
more
than
double
the
share
in
along
with
private
schools
charters
are
seen
as
responsible
for
declining
enrolments
which
deprive
public-school
districts
of
funds
because
they
are
paid
per
student
but
the
villainisation
of
charter
schools
is
not
the
whole
story
behind
the
teachers
strikes
is
a
broader
angst
and
frustration
with
the
status
quo
according
to
one
superintendent
of
a
large
school
district
that
has
weathered
a
strike
the
idea
that
school
districts
should
quickly
meet
the
demands
of
teachers
may
sound
as
uncontroversial
as
the
rainbows
and
unicorns
on
the
pupil's
sign
in
oakland
but
in
many
instances
settling
with
teachers
will
not
address
the
long-term
problems
facing
public
schools
some
school
districts
have
been
badly
mismanaged
oakland's
has
been
somewhere
between
m
and
m
in
debt
for
the
past
years
and
has
not
taken
the
necessary
steps
to
bring
its
costs
into
line
with
declining
enrolment
three-quarters
of
pupils
qualify
for
free
or
cheaper
lunches
which
they
get
when
schools
are
open
and
rely
on
free
tutoring
to
prepare
them
for
the
upcoming
sat
exams
making
the
strikes
there
particularly
painful
the
district
operates
nearly
twice
as
many
schools
as
pupil
numbers
justify
but
teachers
who
are
striking
oppose
efforts
to
close
any
and
reduce
costs
a
report
from
a
civil
grand
jury
last
year
chastised
the
district
for
a
laundry
list
of
errors
and
poor
decisions
contributing
to
the
fiscal
crisis
settling
the
current
strike
by
agreeing
to
salary
increases
and
backing
away
from
school
closures
would
exacerbate
the
district's
various
problems
another
issue
that
gets
too
little
attention
is
the
cost
of
retired
teachers
pensions
and
health-care
costs
which
are
rising
in
many
states
including
california
in
the
state
approved
a
increase
in
income-tax
rates
in
part
to
fund
schools
more
efficiently
but
all
the
extra
revenue
went
on
pensions
and
health
care
for
pensioners
rather
than
on
pupils
or
teachers
salaries
according
to
david
crane
of
govern
for
california
a
non-partisan
political
outfit
the
state
could
enact
some
reforms
for
example
california
which
educates
of
america's
public-school
pupils
chooses
to
subsidise
health
care
for
retired
teachers
and
their
families
who
could
otherwise
qualify
for
the
affordable
care
act
aca
and
medicare
eliminating
that
subsidy
could
save
the
state
bn
allowing
it
to
pay
teachers
more
in
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
alone
this
change
would
translate
into
around
more
pay
for
every
teacher
says
mr
crane
young
teachers
are
probably
unaware
that
they
are
forgoing
higher
salaries
to
support
pensions
and
benefits
for
their
older
peers
and
it
is
not
a
topic
that
teachers
tend
to
talk
about
the
last
thing
unions
want
to
introduce
into
the
conversation
is
something
their
younger
members
would
be
pissed
off
about
explains
mr
rotherham
of
bellwether
frustration
with
an
underperforming
system
is
not
confined
to
schools
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
can
be
found
in
many
corners
of
american
life
but
they
risk
eroding
what
could
be
a
constructive
conversation
about
how
to
reinvigorate
public
schools
and
do
better
by
pupils
my
concern
is
that
it's
become
a
political
war
of
us
versus
them
versus
doing
right
by
our
kids
says
ted
lempert
of
children
now
a
non-profit
we
are
breaking
apart
consensus
and
reframing
the
debate
about
education
in
a
way
that
makes
reforms
harder
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
