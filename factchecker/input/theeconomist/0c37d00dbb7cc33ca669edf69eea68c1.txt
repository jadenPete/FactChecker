cory
booker
helped
turn
round
newark's
schools
taking
credit
for
that
in
the
democratic
primary
is
tricky
on
september
th
the
oprah
winfrey
show
hosted
the
unlikely
trio
of
cory
booker
who
was
then
the
democratic
mayor
of
newark
chris
christie
who
was
then
the
republican
governor
of
new
jersey
and
a
skittish-looking
mark
zuckerberg
they
were
there
to
announce
a
m
donation
from
the
facebook
founder
to
help
newark's
beleaguered
schools
mr
booker
promised
it
would
be
a
bold
new
paradigm
for
educational
excellence
in
the
country
and
helped
raise
another
m
in
matching
donations
now
that
mr
booker
is
a
new
jersey
senator
running
for
president
in
a
crowded
democratic
primary
he
seldom
brings
up
the
zuckerberg
donation
that
is
not
because
the
schools
have
failed
to
improve
they
have
done
so
significantly
though
not
to
the
degree
envisioned
by
mr
booker
who
exclaimed
that
you
could
flip
a
whole
city
instead
it
is
because
the
ingredients
of
newark's
education
turnaround
the
closing
of
bad
schools
renegotiating
teacher
contracts
to
include
merit
pay
and
expanding
high-performing
charter
networks
are
anathema
to
the
democratic
primary
voting
base
outside
newark
the
public
perception
of
the
school
reforms
remains
widely
negative
much
of
that
is
due
to
dale
russakoff
a
journalist
who
wrote
an
influential
and
stinging
portrayal
of
the
efforts
in
her
book
the
prize
cami
anderson
the
hard-charging
superintendent
appointed
to
oversee
the
plan
was
widely
criticised
and
then
resigned
after
mr
booker
decamped
from
newark
to
washington
in
ras
baraka
a
former
high-school
principal
who
is
the
current
mayor
won
election
after
making
the
contest
a
referendum
over
ms
anderson's
popularity
a
review
of
the
recent
evidence
suggests
this
pessimism
is
misplaced
for
district
schools
the
high-school
graduation
rate
has
climbed
to
up
from
in
a
study
done
by
researchers
at
harvard
found
an
initial
drop-off
in
test
scores
and
then
after
the
reforms
set
in
a
big
improvement
in
english
tests
though
not
in
maths
two-thirds
of
the
growth
was
attributable
to
changes
in
the
composition
of
schools
the
closing
down
of
a
third
of
the
city's
public
schools
and
expansion
of
high-performing
charters
today
of
black
pupils
attend
schools
that
exceed
the
state
average
compared
with
in
all
this
even
though
newark
remains
profoundly
poor
nearly
of
the
children
live
with
families
making
less
than
the
federal
poverty
line
currently
for
a
family
of
three
the
vast
majority
of
schoolchildren
are
poor
enough
to
qualify
for
free
or
reduced-price
school
lunches
if
mr
booker
believes
deeply
in
anything
it
is
school
choice
in
when
he
was
still
a
little-known
city
councillor
he
founded
excellent
education
for
everyone
which
advocates
charter
schools
and
voucher
programmes
he
sat
on
the
board
of
alliance
for
school
choice
a
national
organisation
alongside
betsy
devos
who
would
become
education
secretary
under
president
donald
trump
school
choice
has
always
scrambled
the
usual
left-right
divide
in
american
politics
mr
booker's
belief
in
it
differs
strongly
from
ms
devos's
and
as
a
senator
he
voted
against
her
confirmation
whereas
those
on
the
right
see
parental
choice
as
a
good
in
itself
and
as
a
way
to
expand
religious
education
progressives
favour
charter
schools
as
a
path
to
opportunity
for
poor
black
and
hispanic
children
whom
urban
school
systems
have
failed
for
decades
what
do
middle-class
people
do
they
don't
wait
for
the
district
to
fix
itself
if
school
choice
is
good
enough
for
middle-class
people
then
poor
people
should
be
able
to
as
well
says
shavar
jeffries
a
civil-rights
lawyer
who
runs
democrats
for
education
reform
a
pro-charter
group
ms
anderson
the
former
superintendent
who
now
runs
a
school-discipline
initiative
feels
vindicated
the
results
speak
for
themselves
she
says
the
fact
that
the
establishment
has
been
quiet
is
because
it's
working
the
rhetoric
from
mr
baraka
the
mayor
who
pushed
her
out
has
changed
from
outright
hostility
to
comfortable
neutrality
ms
anderson
describes
an
ingrained
culture
of
cronyism
before
she
arrived
requests
to
hire
as
a
teacher
the
girlfriend
of
someone
politically
connected
even
though
she
could
not
write
a
cover
letter
or
not
to
sack
another
grandee's
nephew
for
punching
someone
in
a
school
cafeteria
ms
anderson
fired
most
of
the
district's
principals
whom
she
found
unsatisfactory
and
hired
her
own
handpicked
ones
disruption
was
also
especially
threatening
because
the
school
district
was
one
of
the
largest
employers
in
the
city
the
budget
was
nearly
bn
a
year
meaning
that
even
the
impressive-seeming
m
donation
which
was
spent
over
five
years
represented
only
a
annual
increase
in
funding
some
of
the
jobs
supported
by
the
big
budget
seemed
superfluous
in
her
book
ms
russakoff
describes
a
gogol-like
setting
in
which
the
clerks
had
clerks
more
than
half
of
the
district's
funding
a
not-paltry
per
pupil
was
gobbled
up
in
central-bureaucracy
costs
before
it
reached
classrooms
a
third
of
pupils
in
newark
now
attend
charter
schools
according
to
an
assessment
done
by
credo
a
research
outfit
at
stanford
university
in
newark's
charters
were
the
second
highest-performing
in
the
country
they
delivered
gains
in
maths
and
reading
almost
equivalent
to
a
full
additional
year
of
instruction
the
researchers
estimated
the
latest
state
assessments
for
reading
and
maths
for
pupils
in
the
third
to
eighth
grades
roughly
between
the
ages
of
and
still
show
stark
differences
of
pupils
in
newark's
charter
schools
were
proficient
in
english
compared
with
just
in
the
traditional
public
schools
for
maths
the
numbers
were
compared
with
in
both
cases
the
charters
beat
the
state
average
a
remarkable
achievement
given
the
impoverishment
of
newark
and
the
high
quality
of
the
state's
other
schools
as
a
result
demand
for
charters
from
parents
is
high
before
a
common
enrolment
system
was
in
place
the
waiting
list
for
kipp
schools
a
high-performing
charter
network
had
children
on
it
says
ryan
hill
the
co-founder
one
of
the
top-ranked
high
schools
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
north
star
academy
charter
which
is
non-white
and
poor
its
most
recent
valedictorian
is
heading
to
princeton
not
all
charters
are
so
good
on
average
their
outcomes
are
similar
to
those
of
traditional
public
schools
they
do
better
in
cities
and
worse
elsewhere
the
problem
is
that
teachers
unions
are
at
their
strongest
in
precisely
the
places
where
charters
are
best
making
the
politics
of
school
reform
treacherous
for
democrats
elizabeth
warren
the
massachusetts
senator
also
running
for
the
democratic
nomination
favoured
school
choice
before
she
was
a
public
figure
on
similar
progressive-minded
grounds
she
worried
that
the
zero-sum
race
to
buy
property
near
good
schools
was
endangering
middle-class
finances
but
she
opposed
a
referendum
to
increase
the
number
of
charters
in
boston
despite
the
fact
that
these
are
the
highest-performing
in
the
country
mr
booker
is
trying
to
navigate
these
treacherous
waters
his
proposed
education
manifesto
for
is
to
increase
funding
for
educating
special-needs
children
and
to
pay
teachers
more
these
proposals
are
fine
yet
mr
booker
is
the
only
candidate
with
a
serious
educational
achievement
under
his
belt
and
the
essential
ingredients
of
that
turnaround
are
not
what
he
is
promising
now
his
campaign
replies
that
there
is
no
one-size-fits-all
solution
for
education
reform
mr
booker
is
already
taking
flak
for
his
record
in
newark
cory
booker
hates
public
schools
blusters
a
headline
from
jacobin
a
widely
read
democratic-socialist
magazine
he
has
some
defenders
too
though
it
is
a
shame
to
deride
the
good
work
that
was
done
in
newark
as
a
defect
of
his
candidacy
or
his
worldview
says
derrell
bradford
a
long-time
advocate
of
education
reform
who
worked
with
mr
booker
early
in
his
career
newark
now
is
better
than
when
i
took
my
job
in
if
you're
a
poor
kid
a
black
kid
your
opportunity
to
succeed
is
much
higher
than
before
is
it
what
it
should
be
or
ought
to
be
still
no
but
there's
been
tremendous
progress
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
