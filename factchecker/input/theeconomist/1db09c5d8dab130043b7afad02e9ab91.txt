straight
pride
struggles
to
catch
on
gay
activists
ponder
how
to
respond
to
an
event
which
aims
to
outrage
them
it's
harder
to
come
out
as
conservative
than
gay
complains
david
elkins
a
pensioner
whose
t-shirt
reads
it's
ok
to
be
white
straight
and
male
luckily
he
found
acceptance
at
boston's
first
straight-pride
parade
behind
him
a
clown
with
a
rainbow
wig
and
green
face-paint
wandered
past
a
truck
festooned
with
trump
posters
and
a
child
held
a
sign
that
says
make
normalcy
normal
again
the
music
in
the
background
veers
from
ymca
an
odd
choice
to
god
bless
the
usa
before
settling
on
a
disco
number
whose
chorus
is
just
the
word
freedom
sung
over
and
over
we
don't
hate
gay
people
insists
dawn
who
is
reluctant
to
give
her
surname
and
stands
amid
a
sea
of
american
flags
some
of
us
used
to
be
gay
the
event
held
on
august
st
was
organised
by
a
group
called
super
happy
fun
america
which
says
it
campaigns
for
heterosexuals
america's
oppressed
majority
as
the
group's
name
suggests
its
intention
was
partly
to
troll
critics
and
provoke
them
into
outrage
the
language
on
its
website
often
mockingly
mirrors
that
used
by
social-justice
activists
some
lgbt
activists
thought
it
was
best
to
ignore
the
parade
and
starve
it
of
attention
others
felt
compelled
to
oppose
it
the
roughly
people
who
attended
it
were
vastly
outnumbered
not
just
by
the
almost
counter-protesters
but
also
by
the
police
keeping
the
groups
apart
debates
over
gay
rights
have
largely
taken
a
back
seat
in
the
current
round
of
america's
culture
wars
compared
with
issues
of
race
and
gender
this
is
less
true
of
transgender
rights
polling
by
the
pew
research
centre
shows
that
almost
two-thirds
of
americans
including
nearly
half
of
republicans
now
support
gay
marriage
straight
pride
which
has
lived
for
years
on
the
fringes
of
social
media
has
struggled
to
catch
on
analogous
movements
like
men's-rights
activism
and
white
nationalism
both
of
which
have
inspired
acts
of
terrorism
are
far
better
known
even
among
those
at
the
parade
motivations
varied
a
few
like
lois
who
had
travelled
from
los
angeles
warned
darkly
of
gay
domination
and
schools
teaching
anal
sex
to
five-year-olds
others
like
kristy
a
transgender
woman
said
they
just
wanted
to
support
free
speech
some
brought
signs
supporting
the
president's
proposed
border
wall
i'm
only
here
to
make
the
left
look
ridiculous
to
draw
them
out
and
expose
their
true
colours
said
patrick
many
spent
the
entire
parade
filming
the
counter-marchers
attitudes
like
patrick's
made
it
tricky
for
the
event's
critics
to
decide
how
to
respond
the
organisers
of
boston's
gay-pride
parade
which
drew
people
this
year
released
a
statement
saying
they
were
not
interested
in
responding
to
their
bait
the
counter-marchers
chanting
slogans
like
boston
hates
you
disagreed
i
know
they
want
to
go
home
and
say
i
triggered
a
snowflake
but
it's
a
stronger
message
to
oppose
them
said
meghan
self
a
schoolteacher
to
do
nothing
is
to
say
it's
ok
many
described
their
opponents
rightly
or
wrongly
as
white
supremacists
like
a
lot
of
the
parade-goers
they
saw
this
march
as
just
another
front
in
the
culture
wars
or
the
resistance
to
the
president
the
parade
ended
with
speeches
outside
boston's
city
hall
the
small
audience
cheered
as
one
roared
i
want
to
say
it's
not
ok
to
be
gay
but
they
seemed
more
hesitant
when
another
an
african-american
woman
introduced
only
as
barbara
from
harlem
said
thank
god
for
slavery
her
tribute
to
america's
judeo-christian
principles
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
of
not
judeo
a
later
speaker
declared
we
are
living
in
a
time
when
bad
is
good
and
good
is
bad
many
of
the
counter-protesters
kept
far
away
with
multiple
layers
of
barricades
would
probably
have
agreed
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
