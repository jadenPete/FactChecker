the
gripping
case
of
scott
warren
is
offering
assistance
to
illegal
immigrants
a
protected
religious
practice
one
trouble
with
liberty
is
that
you
never
know
what
people
will
do
with
it
in
recent
years
american
conservatives
have
been
passionate
defenders
of
individual
religious
freedoms
such
as
the
right
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
same-sex
weddings
but
scott
warren
pictured
an
idealistic
geographer
who
is
facing
felony
charges
for
succouring
migrants
in
the
arizona
desert
has
now
become
a
standard-bearer
for
a
very
different
sort
of
conscientious
objection
on
june
th
his
trial
which
has
been
closely
watched
at
the
liberal
end
of
america's
religious
spectrum
reached
deadlock
after
jurors
failed
to
agree
despite
three
days
of
deliberation
that
was
a
better
result
than
mr
warren
and
his
many
supporters
feared
prosecutors
may
seek
a
retrial
lawyers
for
mr
warren
who
has
taught
at
arizona
state
university
have
insisted
that
a
generically
spiritual
motive
lay
behind
the
actions
he
took
which
involved
feeding
and
sheltering
two
migrants
he
has
been
charged
with
conspiring
to
harbour
and
transport
illegal
aliens
crimes
punishable
by
up
to
years
in
jail
with
the
help
of
some
eminent
scholars
his
defenders
had
made
an
unsuccessful
but
plausible
enough
effort
to
shelter
him
behind
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
of
a
measure
intended
to
protect
a
broad
variety
of
religiously
motived
acts
from
the
heavy
hand
of
the
law
where
does
religion
come
in
mr
warren
is
a
leading
light
in
no
more
deaths
an
ngo
associated
with
the
universalist
unitarian
church
a
liberal
denomination
which
tries
to
reduce
the
number
of
would-be
migrants
who
perish
in
the
desert
nearly
bodies
have
been
found
in
southern
arizona
since
although
not
formally
religious
himself
mr
warren
has
much
to
say
about
the
numinous
nature
of
the
desert
and
the
rituals
he
performs
when
as
has
happened
times
he
discovers
a
dead
body
on
june
th
robed
representatives
of
more
conventional
faiths
including
a
rabbi
and
an
imam
as
well
as
many
protestant
churches
came
to
the
courthouse
in
tucson
to
show
their
solidarity
jim
wallis
a
prolific
writer
who
is
one
of
the
best-known
figures
on
america's
religious
left
says
the
case
was
crystal-clear
he
is
being
prosecuted
for
following
the
command
of
jesus
which
is
to
feed
the
hungry
refresh
the
thirsty
and
invite
in
the
stranger
the
case
was
so
simple
that
it
should
not
be
a
matter
of
political
contention
he
thought
but
the
cause
of
religious
freedom
which
is
one
of
america's
founding
ideals
has
mutated
ideologically
in
odd
ways
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
rfra
drew
near-unanimous
support
in
congress
and
was
signed
by
bill
clinton
it
laid
down
that
the
government
could
not
substantially
burden
an
individual's
religious
liberty
unless
it
had
a
compelling
interest
in
doing
so
the
law
was
a
counterweight
to
a
supreme
court
ruling
concerning
the
use
of
intoxicants
in
native-american
rituals
which
had
made
it
a
bit
easier
for
the
government
to
override
individual
liberty
in
matters
of
belief
then
in
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
rfra
could
not
constrain
the
behaviour
of
state
governments
that
prompted
states
to
pass
their
own
versions
of
the
rfra
of
which
the
most
controversial
was
the
one
signed
in
indiana
by
governor
mike
pence
now
the
vice-president
which
was
denounced
as
a
charter
for
discrimination
against
gay
people
as
elizabeth
sepper
of
the
university
of
texas
points
out
the
clinton
rfra
was
intended
to
protect
small
idiosyncratic
minorities
or
individuals
recently
rfra-type
laws
have
been
used
to
shield
members
of
the
christian
majority
from
having
to
obey
anti-discrimination
laws
that
has
made
the
religious
freedom
slogan
so
unpopular
on
the
left
that
house
democrats
introduced
a
bill
over
the
winter
that
would
limit
the
scope
of
freedom-of-conscience
cases
to
harm
third
parties
mr
warren
is
by
no
means
the
only
progressive
hero
invoking
religious
liberty
in
court
the
clinton
law
is
also
being
cited
by
seven
left-wing
catholic
activists
from
the
anti-nuclear
plowshares
movement
who
face
the
possibility
of
years
in
jail
after
entering
a
naval
submarine
base
in
in
some
ways
the
use
of
religious-freedom
laws
in
left-wing
causes
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
tactics
energetically
employed
by
conservatives
by
rooting
successfully
for
the
right
of
devout
employers
to
opt
out
of
contraceptive
coverage
conservatives
have
loosened
the
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
substantial
burden
and
reduced
the
onus
of
proof
if
the
pious
owners
of
a
corporation
can
argue
that
their
freedom
is
substantially
burdened
by
a
health-care
plan
then
it
becomes
a
bit
more
plausible
for
an
altruistic
aid
worker
or
even
a
pacifist
nun
to
say
that
freedom
is
being
curtailed
unless
they
too
are
free
to
act
on
their
ideals
as
brie
loskota
of
the
university
of
southern
california
puts
it
conservatives
have
turned
religious
freedom
into
a
super-right
that
undermines
all
others
their
new
idea
is
that
an
individual
conscience
can
override
absolutely
anything
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
