sour
in
one
respect
president
donald
trump
who
at
times
likes
to
claim
swedish
ancestry
is
true
to
his
german
origins
like
most
german
family
companies
his
business
has
a
hausbank
a
go-to
bank
with
whom
he
has
a
long-standing
relationship
but
unlike
those
companies
he
did
not
choose
his
hausbank
because
of
geographical
proximity
or
family
tradition
he
did
business
with
deutsche
bank
because
no
other
big
bank
would
lend
him
millions
after
several
of
his
businesses
went
bankrupt
in
the
s
germany's
biggest
bank
was
so
keen
to
be
a
prominent
player
in
new
york
property
that
it
ignored
multiple
red
flags
about
the
financial
health
of
mr
trump's
empire
it
reportedly
lent
him
bn
over
nearly
two
decades
the
once-cordial
relationship
between
mr
trump
and
deutsche
has
soured
when
he
became
a
serious
contender
for
the
presidency
in
deutsche
stopped
lending
him
money
he
still
owes
the
bank
tens
of
millions
deutsche
has
started
to
hand
over
financial
documents
related
to
mr
trump's
business
dealings
to
letitia
james
new
york's
attorney-general
who
is
investigating
the
president
since
january
the
bank's
lawyers
have
been
co-operating
with
investigators
from
the
democratic-controlled
house
intelligence
and
financial
services
committees
who
are
probing
the
president's
financial
affairs
after
the
committees
served
a
subpoena
on
april
th
the
bank
signalled
it
would
share
decades
of
financial
records
with
them
by
may
th
unless
a
court
intervened
on
april
th
mr
trump
sued
deutsche
and
capital
one
an
american
bank
in
a
federal
court
in
new
york
to
stop
the
banks
from
complying
with
the
subpoenas
the
lawsuit
asks
the
court
to
declare
the
committees
subpoenas
invalid
it
claims
they
were
issued
to
harass
mr
trump
no
grounds
exist
to
establish
any
purpose
other
than
a
political
one
says
the
suit
why
is
mr
trump
so
keen
to
prevent
records
held
by
his
primary
lender
from
coming
to
light
because
deutsche's
documents
include
internal
company
memos
estimates
of
the
value
of
mr
trump's
assets
and
parts
of
his
personal
and
business-tax
returns
which
the
treasury
department
which
oversees
the
irs
has
been
reluctant
to
divulge
deutsche
bank
says
the
president's
lawsuit
reflects
a
dispute
between
mr
trump
and
congressional
committees
and
that
the
bank
is
not
accused
of
any
wrongdoing
we
remain
committed
to
providing
appropriate
information
to
all
authorised
investigations
says
the
bank
adam
schiff
chair
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
praised
deutsche
for
its
assiduous
co-operation
with
congressional
investigators
the
ailing
lender
is
trying
to
salvage
its
reputation
it
hopes
that
by
providing
more
transparency
it
will
help
to
end
unfounded
speculation
that
it
helped
to
channel
russian
money
to
mr
trump
deutsche
also
vows
to
abide
by
a
court
order
regarding
the
congressional
investigation
the
president's
suit
seems
unlikely
to
succeed
courts
tend
to
stay
away
from
questioning
lawmakers
motives
for
investigations
and
the
executive-privilege
defence
that
may
fend
off
other
subpoenas
does
not
apply
to
things
the
president
did
in
his
private
life
before
he
was
elected
this
suggests
that
the
two
committees
should
get
some
fresh
reading
material
before
too
long
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
