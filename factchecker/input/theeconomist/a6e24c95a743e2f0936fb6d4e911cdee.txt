incumbency
ain't
what
it
used
to
be
the
president
is
using
his
office
to
impress
his
supporters
and
annoy
everyone
else
donald
trump's
campaign
rallies
have
had
a
makeover
though
most
of
their
signature
features
are
still
evident
the
maga
hats
on
sale
the
testaments
to
mr
trump's
generosity
by
warm-up
speakers
his
dramatic
arrival
by
helicopter
elton
john
and
the
stones
blaring
out
to
make
everyone
feel
young
again
the
production
has
been
brought
up
to
presidential
standards
the
merchandise
stands
at
the
trump
rally
lexington
attended
last
week
in
panama
city
beach
in
florida's
panhandle
were
nfl
quality
everyone
in
the
large
crowd
seemed
to
have
visited
one
the
praise
singers
who
once
consisted
of
a
bunch
of
oddballs
and
jeff
sessions
were
florida's
congressional
delegation
thank
god
for
president
trump
hollered
senator
rick
scott
he
cares
about
florida
like
nobody
else
the
helicopter
is
now
marine
to
the
seventies
music
mr
trump's
stage
managers
added
a
magnificent
firework
display
when
trump
comes
to
town
it's
the
th
of
july
in
a
panhandle
county
that
gave
him
of
the
vote
in
he
could
count
on
a
warm
welcome
even
so
the
emotions
the
president
induced
in
the
lily-white
crowd
wearing
trump-branded
t-shirts
and
shorts
on
a
balmy
evening
were
impressive
i
love
him
i
love
i
love
him
said
darrell
an
air-force
veteran
i
love
him
because
he
cares
the
most
about
the
people
democrats
don't
care
they
want
to
take
money
away
instead
of
giving
it
to
our
people
he
must
have
liked
what
he
was
about
to
hear
mr
trump
began
his
speech
by
boasting
of
the
billions
in
disaster
relief
his
administration
has
given
to
florida
after
its
recent
hurricanes
and
he
promised
there
would
be
more
to
come
despite
he
falsely
claimed
democratic
efforts
to
stop
him
by
way
of
a
gratuitous
comparison
he
then
slammed
puerto
rico
which
has
suffered
even
worse
storm
damage
unleashing
a
vast
exodus
of
islanders
to
florida
for
being
greedy
and
corrupt
candidate
trump
dog-whistled
on
race
by
making
wild
claims
about
immigration
as
president
he
can
merely
cite
his
spending
priorities
ninety
minutes
into
mr
trump's
speech
in
which
he
talked
up
the
latest
jobs
numbers
lambasted
his
enemies
and
joined
in
the
hilarity
that
a
heckler
caused
by
suggesting
he
shoot
latino
immigrants
the
crowd
was
still
cheering
him
there
has
been
much
speculation
about
the
electoral
boost
mr
trump
could
get
next
year
from
being
the
sitting
president
this
is
understandable
he
won
in
by
a
whisker
few
of
his
supporters
have
since
deserted
him
and
the
benefits
of
incumbency
in
terms
of
name
recognition
the
mystique
of
the
office
and
the
many
opportunities
it
presents
to
blend
governing
and
campaigning
have
long
been
recognised
throughout
presidential
history
by
one
calculation
incumbency
has
been
worth
around
three
percentage
points
on
average
no
president
has
failed
to
win
re-election
since
george
h.w.
bush
in
and
before
him
jimmy
carter
in
both
of
whom
were
saddled
with
an
economic
downturn
moreover
as
his
performance
in
florida
suggested
mr
trump
will
milk
his
office
for
every
advantage
he
can
he
will
claim
to
have
done
things
for
his
audiences
that
he
has
not
the
disbursement
of
relief
spending
to
florida
has
in
fact
been
slow
and
promise
incredible
things
he
will
mix
politics
and
governing
shamelessly
the
pretext
for
his
panhandle
visit
was
his
desire
to
inspect
a
storm-damaged
air-force
base
that
the
pentagon
thought
about
closing
but
which
he
has
vowed
to
rebuild
at
vast
cost
yet
though
he
stands
to
benefit
from
such
ploys
the
incumbency
effect
in
will
probably
be
weaker
than
in
the
past
that
is
because
what
mr
trump's
supporters
love
about
him
including
the
bullying
public
persona
he
has
used
his
office
to
inflate
almost
everyone
else
loathes
he
has
therefore
gained
even
fewer
supporters
than
he
has
lost
his
approval
ratings
are
as
stable
as
they
are
low
and
the
democrats
as
their
bumper
turnout
in
the
mid-terms
indicated
are
as
motivated
to
remove
him
as
his
supporters
are
to
keep
him
in
place
mr
trump
is
therefore
unlikely
to
get
a
three-point
boost
from
his
incumbency
or
anything
close
to
that
because
it
is
unclear
whether
such
a
large
group
of
swing
voters
even
exists
the
election
is
likely
to
be
decided
by
whichever
side
does
a
better
job
of
mobilising
its
supporters
just
as
barack
obama's
re-election
was
in
with
the
presidency
among
the
tools
that
mr
trump
will
have
at
his
disposal
this
is
risky
for
a
republican
because
the
democrats
have
more
supporters
which
is
why
they
tend
to
win
the
popular
vote
yet
the
electoral
college
mitigates
that
advantage
which
is
how
mr
trump
won
in
it
should
also
be
noted
that
even
if
mr
trump's
hyper-partisanship
makes
him
an
extreme
case
his
two
immediate
predecessors
both
ran
less
inclusive
campaigns
the
second
time
round
this
underlines
the
fact
that
the
depletion
of
swing
voters
and
consequent
reduction
in
the
incumbency
advantage
is
a
long-running
trend
even
in
the
alternative
universe
in
which
mr
trump
could
restrain
himself
and
count
on
incumbency
and
the
strong
economy
to
see
him
home
there
might
not
be
enough
persuadable
centrists
left
for
the
strategy
to
pay
off
despite
his
low
ratings
mr
trump's
more
divisive
style
could
turn
out
to
be
a
better
bet
at
this
juncture
in
particular
it
might
be
his
best
hope
of
tying
in
the
voters
who
have
gone
most
wobbly
on
him
a
group
of
working-class
whites
the
so-called
obama-trump
voters
in
midwestern
states
such
as
michigan
and
pennsylvania
which
he
won
by
tiny
margins
and
needs
to
win
again
given
that
these
voters
have
not
felt
much
of
a
boom
in
their
wages
and
had
no
great
qualms
about
mr
trump's
boorishness
in
it
is
not
obvious
that
they
would
be
likelier
to
stick
with
him
if
he
were
to
tone
it
down
and
lead
with
the
economy
ripping
into
his
opponents
after
all
is
what
mr
trump
is
best
at
and
he
is
anxious
to
get
on
with
that
i'll
take
any
enthused
the
president
in
florida
after
denigrating
the
main
democratic
primary
contenders
let's
just
pick
somebody
please
and
let's
start
this
thing
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle

and
