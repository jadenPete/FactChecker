mar-a-lago
massage
parlours
and
selling
access
to
the
president
the
trump
administration
collects
chancers
influence
peddlers
maybe
worse
ever
since
diners
at
mar-a-lago
snapped
pictures
of
president
donald
trump
plotting
america's
response
to
a
north
korean
missile
test
with
his
japanese
counterpart
there
have
been
national-security
concerns
about
the
president's
winter
white
house
yet
reports
about
a
mar-a-lago
frequenter
called
li
yang
who
also
goes
by
cindy
yang
suggest
they
underestimated
the
risks
of
mr
trump's
freewheeling
style
bearing
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
trump
scandal
the
revelations
from
the
miami
herald
mother
jones
and
others
are
salacious
worrying
and
bizarre
ms
yang
a
year-old
entrepreneur
and
immigrant
from
china
and
her
family
have
founded
massage
parlours
across
florida
robert
kraft
the
owner
of
the
new
england
patriots
was
charged
last
month
with
soliciting
oral
sex
in
one
of
them
orchids
of
asia
which
the
yang
family
no
longer
owned
mr
kraft
is
a
longtime
trump
pal
coincidentally
ms
yang
recently
launched
a
business
peddling
access
to
the
president
and
other
republican
politicians
to
chinese
investors
indeed
she
was
snapped
alongside
mr
trump
at
a
super
bowl
party
in
mar-a-lago
at
which
the
president
was
supporting
mr
kraft's
team
mr
kraft's
arrest
caused
a
media
storm
it
followed
a
months-long
police
operation
against
massage
parlours
in
florida
which
were
alleged
to
be
involved
in
trafficking
sex
workers
yet
on
the
evidence
gathered
from
hidden
police
cameras
over
customers
including
mr
kraft
were
arrested
for
soliciting
and
a
dozen
employees
on
charges
related
to
prostitution
no
one
has
been
charged
with
trafficking
or
anything
more
serious
than
involvement
in
turning
occasional
tricks
at
a
low-end
massage
joint
ms
yang's
recent
business
ventures
which
have
been
much
less
covered
appear
far
more
troubling
according
to
the
herald
she
had
no
involvement
in
politics
before
the
election
she
had
not
voted
for
a
decade
yet
she
suddenly
became
a
fixture
at
high-level
republican
events
her
facebook
page
is
filled
with
photos
of
ms
yang
alongside
the
president
his
two
sons
florida's
governor
ron
desantis
and
other
senior
republicans
she
and
her
relatives
donated
to
the
president's
campaign
and
a
related
political
action
committee
and
her
efforts
appear
to
have
secured
some
of
the
influence
her
company
gy
us
investments
claims
to
have
last
year
she
was
invited
by
the
white
house
to
take
part
in
an
event
organised
by
mr
trump's
asian-american
and
pacific-islander
initiative
the
herald
also
reports
that
she
arranged
for
chinese
businessmen
to
attend
an
exclusive
trump
fund-raiser
in
manhattan
it
is
not
clear
whether
this
amounts
to
an
embarrassing
mess
or
a
serious
security
breach
either
way
it
stinks
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
