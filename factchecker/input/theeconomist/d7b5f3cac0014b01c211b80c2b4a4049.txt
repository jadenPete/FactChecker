manhattan
embraces
road
pricing
nyc
should
copy
singapore
rather
than
london
new
york's
congestion
is
among
the
worst
in
the
world
according
to
an
advisory
panel's
report
published
in
january
last
year
crossing
midtown
by
car
is
soul-destroying
in
the
average
speed
was
miles
per
hour
not
much
quicker
than
a
brisk
stroll
but
relief
is
in
sight
on
april
st
no
really
state
lawmakers
agreed
to
implement
congestion-pricing
making
new
york
the
first
big
american
city
to
do
so
by
vehicles
will
have
to
pay
to
enter
manhattan
south
of
th
street
similar
proposals
go
back
years
but
have
always
stalled
the
regional
plan
association
proposed
road-pricing
in
michael
bloomberg's
plan
was
not
even
debated
on
the
state
legislature
floor
this
time
with
andrew
cuomo
the
state
governor
at
the
wheel
and
bill
de
blasio
new
york's
mayor
riding
shotgun
it
looks
as
if
this
time
is
different
much
of
the
detail
including
how
much
drivers
will
have
to
pay
how
they
will
pay
and
how
often
they
will
pay
have
yet
to
be
decided
a
traffic
mobility
review
board
will
be
set
up
to
work
all
this
out
new
yorkers
living
in
the
fee
zone
who
make
less
than
a
year
will
be
exempt
other
drivers
including
motorcyclists
the
city's
civil
servants
disabled
drivers
the
trucking
industry
new
jersey's
governor
and
commuters
all
want
discounts
credits
or
exemptions
too
which
bodes
ill
if
done
right
congestion-pricing
could
be
expanded
beyond
manhattan
new
york
can
learn
from
other
cities
singapore
for
instance
which
has
had
pricing
for
decades
adjusts
prices
regularly
it
can
also
learn
from
mistakes
london
which
rolled
out
its
pricing
in
bizarrely
is
only
starting
to
charge
on-demand
car
hires
like
uber
stockholm
exempted
too
many
vehicles
which
caused
a
drop
in
fee
revenue
other
car-clogged
cities
considering
tolls
including
los
angeles
philadelphia
portland
san
francisco
and
seattle
are
watching
new
york
a
mayor-appointed
task
force
in
boston
recommended
a
fee
but
so
far
marty
walsh
the
mayor
is
pumping
the
brakes
we
really
have
to
be
a
good
example
says
nicole
gelinas
of
the
manhattan
institute
a
new
york
think-tank
moody's
a
credit-rating
agency
said
the
plan
is
a
credit
positive
for
the
city
the
state
and
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
the
only
possible
roadblock
to
the
scheme
is
new
yorkers
themselves
oppose
fees
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
