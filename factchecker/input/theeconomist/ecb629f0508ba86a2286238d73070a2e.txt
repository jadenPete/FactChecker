black
men
in
america
are
living
almost
as
long
as
white
men
the
chasm
in
life-expectancy
that
once
existed
has
nearly
closed
back
in
when
harlem
was
still
a
byword
for
poverty
criminality
and
the
decline
of
new
york
city
black
men
in
the
neighbourhood
had
a
worse
chance
of
living
to
the
age
of
than
men
in
bangladesh
did
at
that
time
harlem's
residents
almost
all
of
them
black
and
many
of
them
poor
died
of
heart
disease
at
double
the
rate
of
whites
they
died
of
liver
cirrhosis
brought
on
by
alcoholism
or
hepatitis
at
ten
times
the
rate
of
whites
and
they
were
times
likelier
to
be
murdered
today
the
prominent
corner
of
malcolm
x
boulevard
and
west
th
street
houses
a
whole
foods
an
upmarket
grocery
chain
and
life
expectancy
is
up
to
years
that
is
still
five
years
behind
the
rest
of
the
city
but
the
gap
is
no
longer
so
egregious
the
case
of
harlem
exemplifies
a
remarkable
trend
in
american
public
health
that
is
seldom
noticed
the
persistent
gap
in
life
expectancy
between
whites
and
blacks
has
closed
substantially
and
is
now
at
its
narrowest
ever
in
the
earliest
date
for
which
the
centres
for
disease
control
and
prevention
cdc
publishes
statistics
the
life
expectancy
for
black
boys
at
birth
was
years
shorter
than
for
white
boys
put
another
way
the
typical
black
boy
had
less
life
to
live
incremental
progress
however
fitful
was
made
for
the
next
century
but
epidemics
of
crack
hiv
and
urban
violence
threatened
to
reverse
it
by
a
peak
year
for
violent
crime
the
life-expectancy
gap
between
black
and
white
men
had
widened
again
by
nearly
three
years
to
years
but
then
it
began
a
sustained
steady
fall
in
the
black-white
gap
had
narrowed
to
years
for
men
less
and
just
years
less
for
women
though
progress
then
levelled
off
until
the
most
recent
year
available
from
the
cdc
the
trend
is
stable
and
not
reversing
the
downward
trajectory
can
be
explained
by
several
simultaneous
phenomena
not
all
of
them
cheerful
among
the
elderly
more
of
whom
die
after
all
than
the
rest
the
narrowing
is
due
to
mortality
from
heart
disease
and
cancer
declining
faster
for
blacks
than
for
whites
but
for
premature
deaths
racial
gaps
especially
between
black
and
white
men
have
also
narrowed
because
of
substantially
reduced
mortality
from
homicide
the
result
of
the
great
crime
decline
and
hiv
the
result
of
improved
medical
therapies
yet
the
emergence
of
the
opioid
epidemic
which
kills
whites
at
higher
rates
than
other
races
has
also
hastened
the
racial
convergence
criminologists
still
do
not
know
why
violent
crime
and
homicides
began
to
decline
in
the
mid-
s
a
wide
array
of
theories
have
been
proposed
the
eroding
appeal
of
crack
cocaine
mass
incarceration
actually
working
as
intended
legalisation
of
abortion
less
lead
poisoning
of
children
and
the
improving
economy
but
the
public-health
consequences
are
abundantly
clear
particularly
for
black
men
who
were
and
remain
the
most
frequent
victims
of
murder
patrick
sharkey
and
michael
friedson
two
sociologists
conducted
a
thought
experiment
showing
that
life
expectancy
for
black
men
would
have
been
years
lower
if
homicide
rates
had
persisted
at
their
levels
in
that
is
a
remarkably
large
health
effect
on
the
order
of
entirely
eliminating
obesity
among
black
men
the
authors
calculate
that
of
the
narrowing
of
the
life-expectancy
gap
for
black
and
white
men
between
and
could
be
explained
by
the
unexpected
halving
of
the
murder
rate
over
that
period
considerable
improvement
in
the
treatment
of
hiv
has
also
decreased
premature
deaths
for
black
men
who
were
hammered
by
the
epidemic
an
estimated
of
the
m
americans
living
with
hiv
today
are
black
triple
their
share
of
the
population
at
the
peak
of
the
epidemic
around
the
virus
was
killing
blacks
at
an
age-adjusted
rate
of
nearly
per
or
three
times
the
rate
at
which
opioid
overdoses
killed
whites
in
though
blacks
still
make
up
a
majority
of
americans
killed
by
hiv
the
overall
rates
of
death
have
plummeted
to
around
per
at
the
same
time
as
lifespans
have
been
increasing
for
blacks
prospects
for
whites
especially
the
non-elderly
have
sagged
this
is
mainly
because
of
the
rapid
increase
in
deaths
from
drug
overdoses
opioids
chief
among
them
death
rates
for
whites
caused
by
all
drugs
more
than
quadrupled
from
to
and
are
now
higher
than
for
blacks
historically
drug
epidemics
have
disproportionately
hit
non-white
americans
but
of
the
people
killed
by
opioids
in
were
white
opioid
addiction
suicide
and
overdose-related
deaths
all
affect
whites
at
much
higher
rates
than
blacks
some
of
the
reason
for
this
may
ironically
enough
lie
in
racial
discrimination
about
three
in
four
heroin
addictions
began
with
a
legitimate
prescription
the
hotspots
of
the
opioid
crisis
the
tri-state
meeting
of
ohio
kentucky
and
west
virginia
as
well
as
rural
new
england
where
blizzards
of
pills
were
later
followed
by
a
rise
in
overdose
deaths
are
much
whiter
than
the
rest
of
the
country
it
is
consistent
with
pretty
different
rates
of
prescribing
opioids
we
supplied
it
very
differently
to
whites
versus
blacks
in
these
areas
says
ellen
meara
a
health
economist
at
dartmouth
college
but
we
also
know
that
there's
a
lot
of
racial
discrimination
in
our
health-care
system
wherever
they
lived
blacks
were
less
likely
to
obtain
legal
opioids
in
the
first
place
a
study
of
pain-related
visits
to
emergency
departments
between
and
a
period
that
overlaps
with
the
run-up
to
the
crisis
shows
that
whites
were
substantially
more
likely
to
obtain
an
opioid
prescription
even
after
controlling
for
the
reported
severity
of
pain
and
other
factors
a
wealth
of
studies
have
found
similar
effects
doctors
are
also
much
more
likely
to
stop
prescribing
opioids
for
blacks
after
detecting
illicit
drug
use
in
the
case
of
opioids
racial
bias
probably
saved
lives
despite
improvements
in
the
racial
gap
inequality
in
life
expectancy
by
class
and
income
still
remains
the
cdc
has
begun
publishing
estimates
of
life
expectancy
at
the
census-tract
or
neighbourhood
level
life
expectancy
at
the
th
percentile
is
years
compared
with
years
at
the
th
in
chicago
census
tracts
a
few
miles
apart
can
differ
in
average
life
expectancies
by
two
decades
the
estimates
are
quite
closely
related
to
measures
of
income
and
poverty
a
simple
regression
shows
that
a
five-percentage-point
increase
in
the
poverty
rate
is
associated
with
a
one-year
decline
in
life
expectancy
research
by
raj
chetty
an
economist
and
his
colleagues
shows
that
the
income
gap
in
life
expectancy
has
been
growing
even
as
the
racial
one
has
been
declining
so
has
the
education
gap
although
people
have
long
assumed
that
higher
socioeconomic
status
bought
better
health
that
was
not
as
true
for
blacks
as
it
was
for
whites
says
arline
geronimus
a
public-health
professor
at
the
university
of
michigan
now
that
is
changing
the
convergence
is
due
to
more
affluent
educated
blacks
living
longer
while
less-affluent
less-educated
whites
are
not
living
as
long
it
shouldn't
be
interpreted
as
though
we've
made
great
strides
she
says
even
so
the
improvements
for
black
men
run
counter
to
the
drumbeat
of
pessimism
about
race
in
america
black
lives
are
longer
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
