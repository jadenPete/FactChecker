the
era
of
divided
government
in
washington
begins
inauspiciously
will
the
president
be
able
to
see
the
wood
for
the
subpoenas
since
america's
government
partially
shut
down
on
december
nd
roughly
federal
employees
have
been
furloughed
or
compelled
to
work
without
pay
not
since
has
a
government
shutdown
lasted
this
long
none
has
spanned
a
shift
in
partisan
control
of
congress
as
this
one
has
republicans
held
both
legislative
chambers
when
congress
adjourned
in
december
when
it
convened
on
january
rd
democrats
two
months
after
their
mid-term
victory
regained
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
this
messy
opening
to
a
new
era
of
divided
government
matters
not
just
because
federal
workers
are
going
unpaid
and
agencies
unstaffed
it
also
signals
an
end
to
the
congressional
supineness
that
defined
donald
trump's
first
two
years
in
office
behind
the
shutdown
is
mr
trump's
insistence
on
bn
for
a
wall
on
the
southern
border
the
one
that
mexico
was
supposed
to
pay
for
david
cicilline
a
congressman
from
rhode
island
who
heads
the
democratic
party's
messaging
arm
says
there
is
zero
chance
that
mr
trump
will
get
that
much
money
late
last
year
senate
democrats
offered
bn
for
border
security
and
even
that
much
set
house
democrats
snarling
there
is
no
disagreement
that
we
need
to
secure
our
border
says
mr
cicilline
but
we
have
a
responsibility
to
appropriate
funds
in
a
cost-effective
way
a
wall
he
argues
is
a
th-century
solution
to
a
st-century
problem
for
a
time
mr
trump
seemed
to
agree
shortly
before
the
shutdown
he
began
referring
to
a
beautiful
steel
slat
barrier
john
kelly
his
outgoing
chief
of
staff
said
that
we
left
a
solid
concrete
wall
early
on
in
the
administration
in
early
december
mr
trump
backed
off
on
his
demand
for
his
bn
suggesting
he
would
approve
a
short-term
continuing
resolution
without
wall
funding
to
keep
government
open
then
right-wing
talk-show
hosts
attacked
him
for
backing
down
and
he
reversed
course
shutting
down
the
government
and
reiterating
his
demand
for
an
all
concrete
wall
each
side
believes
the
other
will
pay
a
greater
political
price
republicans
have
a
structural
advantage
they
are
suspicious
of
government
while
democrats
have
styled
themselves
the
party
of
good
governance
but
democrats
point
to
mr
trump
saying
during
a
televised
meeting
in
december
with
nancy
pelosi
and
chuck
schumer
democratic
leaders
in
the
house
and
senate
i
will
shut
down
the
government
if
i
don't
get
my
wall
they
may
also
suspect
that
however
loyal
congressional
republicans
appear
in
public
privately
they
are
weary
of
mr
trump's
intemperance
and
unpredictability
and
may
pressure
him
as
the
shutdown
drags
on
some
argue
that
what
mr
trump
really
wants
is
not
the
wall
but
the
fight
over
the
wall
after
all
if
he
really
wanted
his
bn
he
could
negotiate
a
deal
with
democrats
to
get
it
perhaps
by
agreeing
to
provide
dreamers
undocumented
immigrants
brought
to
america
as
children
a
path
to
citizenship
but
his
base
prizes
his
pugnacity
above
any
realistically
attainable
concrete
achievement
and
he
sees
attacking
democrats
as
weak
on
crime
and
immigration
as
a
better
strategy
than
compromise
we
have
the
issue
border
security
he
crowed
on
twitter
two
days
after
christmas
he
believes
not
without
reason
that
his
hawkish
views
on
immigration
won
him
the
presidency
in
and
remain
his
strongest
suit
but
that
theory
was
tested
in
when
republican
congressional
candidates
around
the
country
ended
their
campaigns
by
stoking
fears
of
in
mr
trump's
words
death
and
destruction
caused
by
people
who
shouldn't
be
here
leaving
aside
the
fact
that
immigrants
commit
crimes
at
lower
rates
than
the
native-born
that
tactic
failed
republicans
lost
more
seats
in
last
year's
mid-terms
than
in
any
election
since
watergate
now
ms
pelosi
is
once
again
house
speaker
and
democrats
are
committee
chairmen
with
subpoena
power
how
they
will
use
that
power
will
quickly
become
clear
they
have
spent
months
preparing
matt
bennett
of
third
way
a
centrist
democratic
think-tank
believes
the
committees
will
fire
subpoenas
like
machine
guns
there
will
be
full-blown
investigations
by
the
middle
of
january
elijah
cummings
the
incoming
chair
of
the
house
oversight
committee
has
already
requested
information
about
among
other
things
the
use
of
personal
email
for
government
work
and
payments
to
the
trump
organisation
jerry
nadler
who
will
chair
the
house
judiciary
committee
plans
to
hold
hearings
on
the
administration's
family-separation
policy
and
russian
interference
in
adam
schiff
who
will
head
the
house
intelligence
committee
wants
to
investigate
mr
trump's
business
interests
richard
neal
who
will
run
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
plans
to
compel
the
release
of
mr
trump's
tax
returns
mr
trump's
approval
ratings
remain
stuck
around
unlike
most
presidents
he
has
barely
tried
to
expand
his
appeal
meanwhile
robert
mueller's
investigation
is
grinding
inexorably
forward
the
president
cannot
afford
to
lose
his
cheerleaders
support
now
which
may
explain
his
refusal
to
negotiate
over
the
wall
but
that
need
not
mean
permanent
gridlock
one
can
imagine
democrats
agreeing
to
modestly
increase
border-security
funding
beyond
bn
enough
to
let
mr
trump
save
face
claim
victory
and
reopen
government
beyond
that
the
parties
could
spend
the
next
two
years
battling
over
immigration
while
finding
common
ground
where
they
can
on
infrastructure
for
instance
or
prescription-drug
pricing
for
mr
trump
personal
relationships
can
supersede
partisan
policy
disagreements
he
seems
genuinely
to
respect
ms
pelosi's
toughness
and
accomplishment
he
also
appears
fond
of
the
cut-and-thrust
with
mr
schumer
a
fellow
outer-borough
new
yorker
but
his
personalisation
of
politics
cuts
the
other
way
too
bill
clinton
was
able
to
shrug
off
republican
efforts
to
impeach
him
as
just
business
while
keeping
focused
on
policy
goals
mr
trump
a
famous
counter-puncher
has
shown
no
such
ability
to
compartmentalise
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
