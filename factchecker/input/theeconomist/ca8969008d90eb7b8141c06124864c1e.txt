what
to
expect
after
john
bolton's
exit
john
bolton's
successor
as
national
security
adviser
is
unlikely
to
change
america's
foreign
policy
for
three
years
president
donald
trump's
foreign
policy
has
seesawed
between
threats
to
bomb
enemies
and
moon-shot
diplomacy
the
president
has
flirted
with
nuclear
war
with
north
korea
only
to
become
the
first
sitting
president
to
step
onto
its
soil
he
has
strangled
iran's
economy
and
ordered
bombers
into
the
air
then
offered
talks
a
troop
surge
in
afghanistan
gave
way
to
a
proposed
summit
with
the
taliban
john
bolton's
appointment
as
national
security
adviser
in
april
seemed
to
tilt
the
scales
towards
the
hawks
his
acrimonious
departure
on
september
th
fired
by
presidential
tweet
suggests
that
mr
trump
is
now
in
a
dealmaking
mood
ahead
of
next
year's
election
that
is
likely
to
have
consequences
for
america's
relations
with
enemies
and
allies
alike
in
recent
months
mr
bolton
has
clashed
with
the
president
on
many
fronts
mr
trump
grew
impatient
with
his
adviser's
dogged
opposition
to
making
concessions
during
negotiations
with
kim
jong
un
of
north
korea
and
his
fixation
with
sanctions
on
iran
nicol
s
maduro's
hold
on
power
in
venezuela
also
proved
more
durable
than
mr
bolton
advertised
mr
trump
sees
economic
and
military
muscle-flexing
as
part
of
a
bargaining
process
in
which
foes
he
hopes
morph
quickly
into
interlocutors
mr
bolton
would
settle
for
nothing
less
than
their
surrender
he
forcefully
opposed
mr
trump's
proposal
to
ease
sanctions
against
iran
in
order
to
secure
a
meeting
with
hassan
rouhani
iran's
president
but
the
last
straw
appears
to
have
been
mr
bolton's
dissent
over
mr
trump's
invitation
later
rescinded
to
the
taliban
to
sign
a
peace
agreement
at
camp
david
the
presidential
retreat
mr
bolton's
influence
should
not
be
overstated
he
was
more
irritant
than
obstacle
he
could
not
prevent
mr
trump
from
pulling
troops
out
of
syria
pursuing
talks
with
the
taliban
and
charming
mr
kim
even
so
his
departure
is
a
statement
of
presidential
intent
though
mr
trump
considers
himself
a
master
tactician
and
accomplished
dealmaker
he
has
yet
to
secure
a
big
diplomatic
deal
after
three
years
in
office
meanwhile
mr
maduro
remains
firmly
in
power
while
arms
control
with
russia
is
collapsing
north
korea
continues
to
churn
out
bomb
fuel
and
iran's
nuclear
programme
is
expanding
once
more
violence
against
civilians
in
afghanistan
stands
at
near-record
levels
mr
trump
eager
for
a
first-term
legacy
is
therefore
likely
to
renew
his
pursuit
of
grand
bargains
probably
punctuated
by
set
pieces
like
the
trio
of
encounters
with
mr
kim
iran
looks
to
be
first
on
the
list
mike
pompeo
the
secretary
of
state
a
hardliner
himself
who
nevertheless
feuded
with
mr
bolton
hinted
on
september
th
that
mr
trump
could
meet
mr
rouhani
with
no
preconditions
during
the
un
general
assembly
which
begins
on
september
th
that
would
be
the
first
meeting
between
american
and
iranian
leaders
since
iran's
islamic
revolution
in
and
a
route
to
easing
six
months
of
growing
tensions
although
mr
trump
said
that
talks
with
the
taliban
were
dead
they
may
well
be
resuscitated
it
is
hard
to
know
why
they
collapsed
perhaps
because
the
president
saw
a
deficiency
in
the
agreement
or
because
of
insurgent
violence
which
has
killed
thousands
of
afghans
since
talks
began
perhaps
because
an
american
soldier
was
killed
at
an
inopportune
moment
or
because
of
the
poor
optics
of
hosting
the
taliban
at
camp
david
the
weekend
before
september
th
the
biggest
prize
of
all
would
be
russia
whose
covert
intervention
in
america's
election
was
intended
to
help
nudge
mr
trump
into
office
in
august
mr
trump
unnerved
several
allies
at
the
g
summit
in
france
by
reiterating
his
demand
that
russia
be
readmitted
to
the
club
the
president
will
be
encouraged
by
a
thaw
in
the
ukraine
crisis
following
the
exchange
of
prisoners
between
russia
and
ukraine
on
september
th
and
recent
efforts
by
emmanuel
macron
france's
president
to
repair
europe's
own
frayed
ties
with
russia
here
mr
trump
might
see
arms
control
as
an
opportunity
mr
bolton
a
veteran
saboteur
of
nuclear
diplomacy
urged
the
president
to
quit
the
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
inf
treaty
and
played
down
the
prospects
that
new
start
the
linchpin
of
arms
control
between
america
and
russia
would
be
renewed
in
though
the
inf
treaty
died
on
august
nd
new
start
now
looks
a
little
likelier
to
limp
on
mr
bolton's
departure
leaves
mr
pompeo
as
the
administration's
dominant
foreign-policy
voice
he
lacks
mr
bolton's
familiarity
with
the
federal
bureaucracy
but
he
has
a
skill
vital
for
survival
in
this
administration
a
willingness
to
accommodate
mr
trump's
views
shaping
them
if
necessary
rather
than
blocking
or
sabotaging
their
implementation
mr
pompeo
also
possesses
an
ability
to
turn
the
president's
gut
instincts
into
policy
mr
trump
says
he
will
name
mr
bolton's
replacement
the
fourth
national
security
adviser
in
three
years
a
record
within
days
several
names
have
been
floated
each
typifying
a
different
approach
mr
trump
could
choose
a
veteran
bureaucrat
such
as
brian
hook
the
state
department's
point
man
on
iran
if
he
wants
someone
skilled
at
selling
his
policy
on
fox
news
he
might
choose
richard
grenell
america's
undiplomatic
ambassador
to
germany
or
he
may
opt
for
military
expertise
in
which
case
the
prize
might
go
to
keith
kellogg
a
national
security
adviser
to
the
vice-president
who
filled
in
after
mike
flynn
left
the
administration
whoever
takes
over
their
most
urgent
task
will
be
to
reinvigorate
the
national-security
bureaucracy
that
mr
bolton
who
has
long
held
dim
views
of
bureaucrats
who
are
not
john
bolton
sidelined
to
give
himself
and
his
views
maximum
influence
with
the
president
that
process
is
deliberately
unwieldy
but
it
provides
the
president
with
the
range
of
perspectives
to
inform
his
decisions
and
the
structure
to
enforce
them
if
mr
trump
is
to
have
any
hope
of
striking
advantageous
deals
with
his
adversaries
he
will
need
a
functional
policymaking
apparatus
unfortunately
that
apparatus
cannot
save
mr
trump
from
himself
no
matter
how
proficient
his
adviser
mr
trump
will
still
make
foreign
policy
on
the
fly
tweet
by
tweet
worse
his
obvious
thirst
for
a
legacy-defining
deal
puts
iran
north
korea
and
russia
at
an
advantage
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
