why
hollywood's
writers
are
sacking
their
representatives
the
principal-agent
problem
strikes
again
krista
vernoff
a
television
writer
and
the
executive
producer
of
the
television
drama
grey's
anatomy
called
her
agent
of
years
on
april
th
and
told
him
tearfully
that
he
could
no
longer
represent
her
he
has
done
his
job
well
guided
and
supported
my
career
and
made
me
a
lot
more
money
than
i
would
have
made
without
him
ms
vernoff
wrote
in
the
hollywood
reporter
nevertheless
ms
vernoff
sacked
him
as
part
of
an
acrimonious
standoff
between
the
association
of
talent
agents
a
trade
association
made
up
of
talent
agencies
and
the
writers
guild
of
america
wga
a
union
of
television
and
film
writers
the
guild
complains
that
agencies
are
prospering
at
the
expense
of
the
screenwriters
they
are
supposed
to
represent
following
several
months
of
heated
negotiations
the
guild
instructed
its
active
members
to
dismiss
agents
at
companies
that
had
not
committed
to
its
new
code
of
conduct
which
the
majority
of
hollywood's
biggest
agencies
have
not
many
writers
did
so
dolefully
john
august
who
wrote
the
film
big
fish
wrote
on
twitter
my
agent
of
years
is
a
great
friend
and
a
fighter
for
my
career
i
would
give
him
a
kidney
tomorrow
but
this
isn't
about
him
or
any
single
agent
before
hanging
up
with
her
longtime
representative
ms
vernoff
plaintively
quoted
the
hamilton
playwright
lin-manuel
miranda
telling
him
see
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
war
while
the
entertainment
industry
is
booming
with
companies
such
as
disney
fox
time
warner
comcast
cbs
and
viacom
hauling
in
more
than
bn
in
operating
profits
in
each
of
the
past
three
years
the
writers
guild
reports
that
screenwriters
median
weekly
earnings
dropped
between
and
and
that
compared
with
the
late
s
per
episode
fees
have
declined
when
adjusted
for
inflation
while
the
union
has
previously
directed
its
ire
about
pay
at
production
studios
staging
a
strike
in
and
nearly
striking
again
in
it
is
now
targeting
agencies
agents
used
to
make
money
from
television
writers
by
taking
a
commission
usually
when
their
writers
were
hired
to
work
on
a
show
but
for
the
past
few
decades
agents
have
preferred
to
waive
their
commissions
and
instead
collect
fees
from
studios
in
exchange
for
offering
packages
of
television
contributors
such
as
a
showrunner
a
director
and
several
writers
that
studios
can
hire
at
once
by
forgoing
commissions
and
instead
taking
pay
from
the
studios
they
are
supposed
to
be
negotiating
against
writers
feel
agents
have
no
incentive
to
wrangle
them
the
best
deals
one
television
writer
says
she
has
heard
of
agents
offering
to
accept
lower
salaries
for
a
writer
in
order
to
get
a
show
on
the
air
and
secure
packaging
fees
the
writers
also
complain
that
three
large
talent
agencies
william
morris
endeavor
entertainment
creative
artists
agency
and
united
talent
agency
have
launched
affiliated
companies
that
finance
shows
themselves
they
wonder
how
agents
can
possibly
haggle
for
high
salaries
for
their
clients
while
at
the
same
time
fretting
over
production
costs
according
to
research
conducted
by
the
writers
guild
almost
of
scripted
series
in
the
television
season
were
packaged
with
william
morris
or
creative
artists
involved
in
four-fifths
of
those
packaged
series
agency
practices
are
not
the
only
thing
hurting
writers
salaries
streaming
services
have
also
played
a
role
writers
used
to
derive
a
significant
part
of
their
income
from
residuals
which
are
fees
that
television
networks
pay
writers
for
replaying
their
work
netflix
amazon
prime
and
hulu
have
upended
that
model
paying
writers
far
less
in
such
fees
they
have
also
inspired
an
industry-wide
move
to
television
seasons
with
fewer
episodes
meaning
that
writers
are
guaranteed
work
for
shorter
periods
even
though
agency
practices
are
not
entirely
to
blame
for
dwindling
salaries
there
is
a
sense
among
writers
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
agents
to
alter
their
behaviour
when
harvey
weinstein
came
tumbling
down
says
ms
vernoff
with
an
eye
on
the
story
arc
the
idea
that
old
hollywood
can't
be
changed
crumbled
with
him
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
