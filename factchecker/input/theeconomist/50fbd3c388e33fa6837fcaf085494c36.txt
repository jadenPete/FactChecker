another
shutdown
shut
down
the
federal
government
will
remain
open
thanks
to
the
art
of
the
retreat
deals
are
my
art
form
president
donald
trump
once
wrote
i
like
making
deals
preferably
big
deals
that's
how
i
get
my
kicks
they
are
also
how
he
gets
kicked
as
the
economist
went
to
press
mr
trump
appeared
poised
to
sign
a
spending
bill
that
averted
another
government
shutdown
but
at
further
cost
to
his
reputation
as
an
ace
negotiator
late
last
year
mr
trump
initiated
the
longest
government
shutdown
in
recent
history
because
congress
would
not
approve
the
bn
requested
for
his
border
wall
after
watching
his
approval
ratings
drop
a
few
points
he
agreed
on
january
th
to
reopen
the
government
for
three
weeks
without
funding
for
his
wall
to
give
a
bipartisan
group
of
lawmakers
time
to
hammer
out
a
compromise
on
border-security
spending
both
sides
being
familiar
with
the
president's
earlier
writings
staked
out
maximalist
positions
mr
trump
insisted
on
his
bn
democrats
wanted
to
cap
the
number
of
beds
available
for
undocumented
immigrants
arrested
within
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
while
crossing
the
border
at
around
per
day
well
below
both
current
levels
and
what
the
administration
wanted
the
number
of
beds
matters
because
of
a
bed
mandate
that
requires
america's
immigration
police
to
fill
all
the
beds
in
immigration
detention
centres
that
have
been
paid
for
by
congress
the
pool
of
people
who
are
eligible
for
deportation
from
america
under
this
administration
is
far
greater
than
the
number
of
people
these
places
can
warehouse
so
the
more
beds
there
are
the
more
can
be
detained
for
deportation
later
the
agreement
provides
funding
for
more
than
twice
as
many
beds
as
democrats
wanted
but
it
includes
around
bn
for
new
physical
fencing
along
the
southern
border
not
just
less
than
mr
trump
demanded
but
less
than
then
bn
democrats
offered
him
just
before
the
shutdown
mr
trump
initially
grumbled
that
he
was
not
happy
about
the
deal
sean
hannity
a
fox
news
personality
who
is
among
mr
trump's
strongest
backers
called
it
a
garbage
compromise
while
mark
meadows
who
chairs
the
hard
right
house
freedom
caucus
said
he
could
not
imagine
mr
trump
applauding
something
so
lacking
a
few
days
later
the
spin
had
changed
laura
ingraham
a
hannity-ish
pundit
spun
the
modest
amount
of
wall
funding
as
a
victory
because
nancy
pelosi
the
house
majority
leader
had
initially
said
she
would
not
give
mr
trump
a
single
dollar
for
his
wall
mr
trump
tweeted
that
the
funding
provided
by
congress
will
be
hooked
up
with
lots
of
money
from
other
sources
will
be
getting
almost
billion
regardless
of
wall
money
it
is
being
built
as
we
speak
what
those
other
sources
might
be
or
where
the
figure
of
bn
comes
from
is
a
mystery
the
president
could
yet
declare
a
national
emergency
at
the
border
and
direct
pentagon
funds
to
wall-building
but
the
white
house
would
almost
certainly
be
sued
and
anyway
many
conservatives
quail
at
the
prospect
after
all
what
would
stop
a
future
democratic
president
from
doing
the
same
thing
and
filling
texas
with
solar
panels
and
if
the
wall
is
according
to
mr
trump
already
being
built
then
why
declare
an
emergency
still
if
the
deal
allows
mr
trump
to
claim
victory
while
continuing
to
thump
democrats
on
immigration
that
may
be
optimal
for
him
diplomacy

the
crossfire
of

trump's
