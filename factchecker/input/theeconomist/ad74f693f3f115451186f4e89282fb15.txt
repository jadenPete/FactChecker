why
american
cities
are
so
weirdly
shaped
how
strange
municipal
boundaries
came
about
and
how
they
hold
cities
back
birmingham
england
is
shaped
like
a
kidney
taller
than
it
is
wide
curving
eastwards
slightly
on
its
longer
sides
it
is
contiguous
blob-like
sensible
birmingham
alabama
founded
in
and
named
after
its
english
ancestor
looks
as
if
it
was
imagined
by
a
deranged
computer
straight
lines
and
sharp
angles
and
missing
bits
in
the
middle
see
illustration
above
one
pseudopodium
extends
to
the
west
long
and
thin
until
it
widens
out
a
bit
and
ends
in
a
box
to
the
east
is
a
tumorous
outgrowth
thin
then
wide
then
thin
again
doubling
back
on
itself
several
times
from
san
jose
in
the
west
to
savannah
in
the
east
and
from
tiny
minot
in
north
dakota
to
sprawling
fort
worth
in
texas
odd
city
maps
can
be
found
all
across
america
with
some
exceptions
these
boundaries
are
administrative
confections
that
make
few
allowances
for
geography
population
density
or
common
sense
los
angeles
is
a
striking
example
the
county
is
home
to
incorporated
cities
ranging
in
population
from
vernon
to
m
los
angeles
itself
beverly
hills
population
is
its
own
city
with
its
own
police
force
fire
department
and
school
district
so
is
santa
monica
even
vernon
has
a
police
department
with
some
odd
staff
all
told
the
county
has
about
fire
departments
more
than
police
departments
and
school
districts
los
angeles
is
extreme
but
not
unusual
alabama's
jefferson
county
which
is
one
of
seven
counties
in
the
birmingham
area
is
home
to
municipalities
including
cardiff
population

clarifies
matters
somewhat
dozens
of
independent
cities
slot
neatly
into
the
gaps
around
birmingham
like
a
tricky
jigsaw
puzzle
from
the
air
it
may
appear
that
birmingham
sprawls
but
in
an
administrative
sense
the
city
is
constrained
this
is
a
problem
cities
that
are
unable
easily
to
expand
their
boundaries
are
poorer
more
segregated
have
higher
concentrations
of
poverty
lower
growth
worse
municipal
bond
ratings
and
less
well-educated
workforces
america's
constitution
goes
to
great
lengths
to
demarcate
state
and
federal
powers
the
tenth
amendment
explicitly
reaffirms
that
powers
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
nor
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
cities
derive
their
power
from
state
governments
says
david
rusk
a
former
mayor
of
albuquerque
whose
book
on
annexation
cities
without
suburbs
is
in
its
fourth
edition
all
but
states
follow
dillon's
rule
named
after
a
th-century
judge
which
holds
that
municipalities
only
possess
powers
specifically
granted
to
them
by
state
law
for
municipal
officials
one
way
around
this
is
to
annex
commercial
territory
such
as
shopping
malls
ports
as
in
la
or
airports
chicago
where
there
are
few
resident
voters
to
irk
and
the
tax
returns
are
substantial
in
the
s
birmingham
annexed
overton
a
shopping
centre
there
called
the
summit
contributes
about
of
the
city's
total
revenues
says
darrell
o'quinn
a
birmingham
city
councillor
some
states
including
alabama
require
cities
to
be
contiguous
explaining
the
skinny
tentacles
that
reach
out
to
capture
territory
the
result
is
the
higgledy-piggledy
mess
of
urban
boundaries
most
states
make
it
difficult
for
a
city
to
force
its
neighbours
to
join
it
only
eight
states
allow
municipalities
to
annex
territory
unilaterally
eight
require
the
state
legislature
to
change
municipal
boundaries
the
overwhelming
majority
states
require
a
referendum
in
the
areas
to
be
annexed
according
to
an
analysis
by
greg
lindsey
of
the
university
of
minnesota
these
votes
often
fail
residents
of
unincorporated
areas
resist
annexation
fearing
a
greater
tax
burden
those
in
already
rich
suburbs
fret
about
sharing
their
taxes
with
the
poorer
core
city
and
merging
of
school
districts
municipalities
avoid
annexing
poor
neighbourhoods
because
they
cost
more
to
service
than
they
provide
in
revenue
in
places
like
birmingham
blacks
worry
that
rich
white
suburbanites
will
usurp
their
hard-won
power
the
result
is
duplication
and
waste
as
municipalities
each
pay
councillors
police
and
fire
departments
waste-collection
agencies
and
school
administrators
to
perform
the
same
services
cities
are
reluctant
to
co-operate
even
on
menial
things
like
waste
collection
fearing
an
erosion
of
their
independence
fragmentation
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
many
cities
are
poor
at
providing
public
transport
businesses
use
fragmentation
to
their
advantage
making
known
their
interest
in
moving
to
a
metropolitan
area
and
playing
its
constituent
cities
off
against
each
other
we
get
into
a
bidding
war
trying
to
attract
companies
and
the
only
one
who
wins
is
these
companies
says
mr
o'quinn
firms
win
tax
breaks
and
other
enticements
employees
use
of
infrastructure
puts
a
further
burden
on
the
whole
conglomeration
the
jigsaws
also
deepen
inequality
small
wealthy
cities
can
afford
better
schools
no
matter
how
much
young
white
couples
enjoy
living
in
restored
downtown
lofts
and
strolling
to
artisan
coffee
shops
full
of
reclaimed
wood
they
eventually
move
to
suburban
houses
in
superior
school
districts
when
they
have
children
taking
their
taxes
with
them
struggling
cities
get
poorer
comfortable
ones
get
richer
it
is
for
families
a
sensible
decision
four
of
the
five
best
school
districts
in
alabama
are
in
the
suburbs
of
birmingham
according
to
niche
a
website
mountain
brook
a
birmingham
suburb
is
home
to
the
highest-ranked
school
system
in
the
state
its
median
household
income
is
four
times
that
of
the
mother
city
its
poverty
rate
is
one-seventh
overcoming
restrictive
state
laws
requires
creativity
in
the

minneapolis

their
surrounding

as
they

legislated
that
all
municipalities
in
the
region
had
to
put
part
of
their
commercial
taxes
into
one
kitty
today
the
twin
cities
area
is
one
of
america's
most
successful
with
a
rare
mix
of
well-off
residents
and
affordable
homes
a
more
recent
example
is
charlotte
north
carolina
another
southern
city
that
shares
some
characteristics
with
birmingham
north
carolina
had
some
of
the
most
liberal
annexation
laws
in
the
country
until
recently
it
allowed
cities
to
annex
contiguous
land
more
or
less
unilaterally
between
and
charlotte's
area
grew
by
today
it
is
the
economic
powerhouse
of
north
carolina
its
median
income
is
higher
by
two-thirds
the
unemployment
rate
is
lower
by
a
third
and
the
poverty
rate
is
almost
half
that
of
its
alabaman
counterpart
according
to
a
report
by
the
public
affairs
research
council
of
alabama
parca
a
non-partisan
think-tank

system

there
are
other
templates
for
cities
hobbled
by
fragmentation
pittsburgh
is
only
one
of
allegheny
county's
municipalities
but
it
spent
decades
working
with
the
county
and
its
many
neighbours
to
foster
regional
co-operation
which
is
bearing
fruit
as
it
emerges
as
a
tech
hub
louisville
merged
with
jefferson
county
in
kentucky
uniting
its
neighbouring
municipalities
as
greater
louisville
such
examples
are
less
common
than
they
ought
to
be
yet
change
is
not
impossible
americans
have
long
trusted
local
government
over
the
state
or
federal
sort
local
governments
are
also
largely
non-partisan
as
parca
said
in
its
report
governmental
forms
are
not
handed
down
from
on
high
they
are
created
by
citizens
banding
together
in
enlightened
self-interest
for
birmingham
as
for
many
ailing
cities
the
imperative
is
to
overcome
decades
of
narrow
self-interest
in
pursuit
of
a
more
expansive
sort
