the
best
line
in
the
first
televised
debate
may
hurt
the
democrats
the
eventual
nominee
will
need
to
retain
the
support
of
the
of
democrats
who
say
they
are
conservative
in
their
first
televised
debates
of
the
nominating
contest
democratic
presidential
candidates
made
one
thing
clear
they
will
not
be
hiding
their
enthusiasm
for
policies
that
delight
the
party's
activists
the
most
memorable
moment
came
when
kamala
harris
the
junior
senator
from
california
confronted
former
vice-president
joe
biden
for
his
record
on
school
busing
mr
biden
introduced
legislation
in
that
would
have
curbed
the
practice
if
passed
you
know
there
was
a
little
girl
in
california
who
was
part
of
the
second
class
to
integrate
her
public
schools
and
she
was
bused
to
school
every
day
ms
harris
told
mr
biden
and
that
little
girl
was
me
ms
harris's
barbs
appear
to
have
won
favour
from
democratic
primary
voters
according
to
a
poll
conducted
on
behalf
of
the
economist
by
yougov
their
support
for
ms
harris
increased
by
percentage
points
in
the
week
following
the
first
debates
this
is
no
fluke
other
pollsters
have
also
detected
a
boomlet
in
support
for
the
senator
the
share
of
democratic
primary
voters
picking
ms
harris
as
their
first
choice
doubled
from
in
polls
fielded
during
the
two
weeks
before
the
debate
to
in
those
taken
after
mr
biden
has
taken
a
direct
hit
slumping
an
average
of
points
since
last
week
one
poll
now
has
them
neck-and-neck
although
in
our
poll
mr
biden
is
still
the
first
choice
of
a
plurality
of
democratic
voters
what
might
happen
if
he
or
a
similarly
moderate
candidate
were
to
lose
to
someone
seen
as
more
progressive
some
democrats
are
worried
that
nominating
a
candidate
with
views
on
race
that
are
too
far
to
the
left
of
the
average
voter
could
scare
off
the
remaining
conservative
members
of
their
coalition
this
worry
is
justifiable
in
an
article
published
last
year
tyler
reny
of
ucla
loren
collingwood
of
uc
riverside
and
ali
valenzuela
of
princeton
wrote
that
white
voters
with
racially
conservative
or
anti-immigrant
attitudes
switched
votes
to
donald
trump
in
at
a
higher
rate
than
those
with
more
liberal
views
on
these
issues
according
to
the
authors
those
losses
could
have
been
enough
to
cost
hillary
clinton
the
election
ms
harris
might
also
face
a
backlash
for
holding
views
on
economics
that
are
too
liberal
for
the
electorate
the
senator
supports
lefty
proposals
like
the
green
new
deal
and
abolishing
private
health
insurance
for
example
in
another
paper
last
year
andrew
hall
and
daniel
thompson
both
of
stanford
found
that
candidates
perceived
as
ideologically
extreme
face
a
penalty
at
the
ballot
box
because
they
fire
up
the
other
side
this
is
another
possible
explanation
for
mrs
clinton's
loss
in
although
she
was
no
bernie
sanders
voters
viewed
her
as
more
extreme
than
mr
trump
according
to
a
poll
in
by
the
pew
research
centre
of
voters
thought
ms
clinton
was
liberal
on
most
or
almost
all
issues
whereas
just
thought
mr
trump
was
mostly
or
almost
always
conservative
a
plurality
believed
the
now-president
to
be
a
mix
of
liberal
and
conservative
whereas
just
thought
the
same
of
mrs
clinton
whoever
wins
the
democratic
nomination
will
need
to
retain
the
support
of
a
small
but
still
important
band
of
conservative
democrats
according
to
yougov's
polling
they
still
make
up
of
the
party
today
yet
nominating
a
candidate
just
to
assuage
this
group
comes
with
a
trade-off
the
democratic
nominee
also
needs
to
get
non-white
voters
to
the
polls
after
having
the
largest
voter
turnout
of
any
racial
group
in
both
and
of
black
voters
who
cast
ballots
for
barack
obama
stayed
home
in
according
to
the
economist's
analysis
of
survey
data
from
the
cooperative
congressional
election
study
a
bi-annual
survey
administered
by
harvard
they
might
have
been
the
difference
in
vital
states
like
michigan
and
wisconsin
whomever
the
democrats
nominate
will
have
to
mimic
the
campaign
style
of
mr
obama
who
owed
his
wins
to
a
multiracial
coalition
he
simultaneously
convinced
whites
of
his
moderation
and
excited
african-americans
in
march
mr
obama
delivered
the
most
memorable
speech
of
his
campaign
americans
he
said
need
to
come
together
to
solve
a
set
of
problems
that
are
neither
black
or
white
or
latino
or
asian
but
rather
problems
that
confront
us
all
whether
they
like
it
or
not
democrats
need
votes
from
white
americans
who
did
not
attend
college
if
ms
harris
were
the
nominee
in
she
would
have
to
replicate
mr
obama's
formula
or
else
see
her
prospects
threatened
by
the
electoral
divide
over
racial
attitudes
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
