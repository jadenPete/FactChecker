russia
america
and
the
inf
russia's
suspicion
of
america
is
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
the
white
house
was
draped
with
a
red
flag
with
hammer
and
sickle
inside
the
soviet
delegation
led
by
mikhail
gorbachev
sang
moscow
nights
and
celebrated
a
landmark
agreement
to
eliminate
an
entire
class
of
nuclear
weapons
that
had
threatened
europe
for
years
it
was
december
th
the
next
day
america's
great
and
good
a
group
which
included
a
pushy
entrepreneur
called
donald
trump
flocked
to
lunch
at
the
state
department
to
hear
mr
gorbachev
speak
two
world
wars
an
exhausting
cold
war
plus
small
wars
all
destroying
millions
of
lives
isn't
this
a
high
enough
price
to
pay
for
adventurism
arrogance
contempt
for
the
interests
and
rights
of
others
the
soviet
leader
said
how
far
we
had
come
from
the
days
of
tension
george
shultz
reagan's
secretary
of
state
mused
to
himself
neither
russian
nor
american
military
and
security-service
bosses
shared
the
festive
mood
russia's
top
brass
who
had
spent
their
entire
lives
fighting
america
felt
betrayed
america's
cold
warriors
feared
that
mr
gorbachev
was
trying
to
smother
them
with
kindness
and
lure
them
into
a
trap
thirty
years
later
the
revanchists
view
has
finally
prevailed
while
the
inf
treaty
has
in
effect
been
eroding
for
years
its
scrapping
is
symbolic
of
the
distrust
that
now
permeates
relations
between
america
and
russia
the
problem
is
that
you
america
have
been
playing
the
winner
for
too
long
says
evgeny
buzhinsky
a
former
senior
general
and
member
of
the
russian
general
staff
putin
is
not
gorbachev
he
adds
whereas
the
white
house
sees
the
end
of
the
inf
treaty
as
a
recognition
of
reality
and
the
treaty's
failure
to
restrain
russia
and
china
along
with
several
other
countries
from
developing
the
banned
missiles
the
kremlin
sees
it
as
the
manifestation
of
american
triumphalism
and
a
vindication
of
mr
putin's
inbred
distrust
of
america
the
soviet
union
is
not
a
weak
poor
country
that
can
be
pushed
around
vladimir
kriuchkov
the
head
of
soviet
intelligence
told
his
american
counterparts
in
mr
putin
a
student
of
mr
kriuchkov
has
made
that
his
policy
before
she
joined
the
national
security
council
fiona
hill
an
expert
on
russia
wrote
that
for
mr
putin
the
paradigm
has
not
changed
so
much
yes
communism
is
gone
and
the
soviet
union
has
crumbled
but
from
his
vantage
point
russia
did
not
go
anywhere
military
might
still
makes
right
mr
putin
saw
treaties
such
as
the
inf
agreement
not
as
evidence
of
goodwill
between
the
two
countries
but
as
a
sign
of
russia's
relative
weakness
which
he
has
tried
to
correct
as
a
former
kgb
operative
ms
hill
argued
he
is
obsessed
with
security
or
bezopasnost
literally
the
absence
of
threats
and
constantly
fights
dangers
which
in
his
mind
come
almost
exclusively
from
america
so
what
america
sees
as
russia's
aggression
whether
in
ukraine
and
syria
or
in
presidential
elections
mr
putin
sees
as
a
way
of
deterring
america
and
preserving
russia's
freedom
to
act
without
restraint
in
its
sphere
of
influence
the
problem
ms
hill
argued
is
that
american
politicians
find
it
hard
to
comprehend
that
russia
still
sees
the
united
states
as
a
threat
after
the
end
of
cold-war
competition
this
leads
to
a
spiral
which
has
dragged
down
the
inf
treaty
russia
has
long
cheated
on
its
obligations
but
cried
foul
when
america
decided
to
suspend
the
treaty
and
is
now
presenting
that
decision
as
proof
of
america's
disregard
for
the
post-cold-war
security
architecture
few
western
policymakers
have
much
hope
of
improving
relations
with
mr
putin
as
a
former
kgb
operative
he
prefers
clandestine
actions
and
feints
to
direct
confrontation
these
include
engaging
in
covert
operations
such
as
spreading
disinformation
encouraging
cyber-crime
or
using
mercenaries
all
masked
as
non-state
actors
in
the
words
of
one
senior
american
official
the
task
is
not
to
win
over
mr
putin
but
to
manage
the
conflict
and
professionalise
the
relationship
the
administration
may
hope
that
dismantling
the
treaty
will
lead
to
a
more
sincere
conversation
about
security
so
far
however
there
is
little
indication
that
mr
putin
will
go
along
instead
the
kremlin
is
using
america's
move
for
propaganda
purposes
russian
military
strategists
say
russia
should
assume
that
america
will
place
new
missiles
in
europe
and
get
ready
to
respond
should
america
proceed
we'll
have
to
think
not
only
about
missiles
in
kaliningrad
but
also
those
in
chukotka
that
can
at
least
reach
seattle
mr
buzhinsky
says
the
presence
of
nuclear-armed
missiles
in
eastern
europe
he
adds
would
trigger
a
replay
of
the
cuban
missile
crisis
then
as
our
officers
say
it's
time
to
think
not
about
a
retaliatory
strike
but
about
a
pre-emptive
one
russia
and
america
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
from
the
days
of
gorbachev
and
reagan
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
