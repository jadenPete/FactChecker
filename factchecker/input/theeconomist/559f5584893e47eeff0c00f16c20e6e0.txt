violent
crime
is
down
the
more
petty
sort
remains
stubbornly
high
two
surprises
greet
first-time
visitors
to
california's
bay
area
the
first
is
that
silicon
valley
is
not
a
specific
place
but
a
booming
mini-region
with
no
sign
advertising
when
one
has
arrived
or
left
the
second
is
that
despite
its
beauty
and
wealth
san
francisco
is
one
of
america's
grittiest
cities
in
some
neighbourhoods
people
openly
use
drugs
defecate
on
the
street
and
flagrantly
steal
it
feels
as
though
law
enforcement
has
turned
a
blind
eye
to
many
lesser
offences
while
violent
crime
has
been
on
the
decline
some
non-violent
crimes
have
been
rising
like
one
of
the
city's
hills
see
chart
among
the
nation's
largest
cities
san
francisco
now
has
the
highest
rate
of
property
crime
which
includes
things
like
theft
shoplifting
and
vandalism
per
inhabitant
in
there
were
around
incidents
of
theft
from
cars
triple
the
number
in
it
feels
like
an
epidemic
because
it
is
an
epidemic
says
leif
dautch
a
young
prosecutor
who
is
running
for
district
attorney
in
san
francisco
some
of
those
who
have
been
victims
complain
that
they
are
not
taken
seriously
by
the
justice
system
according
to
one
report
from
charges
are
filed
in
a
mere
of
vehicle
burglaries
in
san
francisco
several
factors
seem
to
explain
the
rise
in
san
francisco's
property
crime
one
is
inequality
with
the
wealth
of
well-heeled
tech
executives
and
visitors
in
plain
sight
of
those
with
little
money
and
fewer
opportunities
the
number
of
unsheltered
homeless
people
in
the
city
rose
by
between
and
policing
is
another
the
presence
of
police
officers
plays
a
strong
role
in
deterrence
says
magnus
lofstrom
of
the
public
policy
institute
of
california
a
think-tank
but
since
the
financial
crisis
and
ensuing
budget
cuts
the
number
of
officers
per
residents
in
san
francisco
has
declined
by
around
broader
statewide
pressures
to
reduce
the
number
of
those
incarcerated
may
also
be
a
factor
california
has
been
undertaking
a
radical
and
welcome
experiment
with
reforming
its
criminal
justice
system
and
reducing
its
vast
prison
population
in
californians
passed
proposition
which
downgraded
a
variety
of
non-serious
non-violent
crimes
to
misdemeanours
instead
of
felonies
this
measure
has
had
no
impact
on
violent
crime
but
it
has
coincided
with
an
uptick
in
property
crime
in
san
francisco
local
prosecutors
are
less
inclined
to
bring
charges
when
there
is
pressure
not
to
incarcerate
people
for
non-violent
crimes
and
police
do
not
want
to
pursue
cases
that
are
unlikely
to
result
in
charges
tolerant
attitudes
towards
crime
may
also
be
a
factor
in
explaining
why
arrests
and
prosecutions
for
property
crime
have
declined
the
bay
area
has
a
culture
that's
very
tolerant
of
disorder
culture
is
holding
up
general
safety
says
justin
mccrary
who
recently
moved
from
the
law
school
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
to
columbia
law
school
a
continued
rise
in
property
crime
would
test
san
francisco's
progressive
values
many
people
have
tolerant
attitudes
towards
crime
because
they
think
it
is
committed
by
the
homeless
mentally
ill
and
those
who
are
down
on
their
luck
but
in
the
case
of
vehicle
break-ins
organised
criminal
gangs
are
behind
of
incidents
in
san
francisco
according
to
the
city
government
in
all
likelihood
the
gangs
are
emboldened
by
the
absence
of
prosecution
business
owners
share
stories
of
people
walking
through
shops
with
calculators
open
on
their
phones
adding
up
the
price
of
merchandise
they
plan
to
steal
with
proposition
california
more
than
doubled
the
value
of
property
required
for
shoplifting
to
count
as
a
felony
to
some
thieves
feel
confident
that
so
long
as
their
haul
falls
below
that
threshold
they
will
face
few
consequences
changes
to
existing
laws
could
help
with
enforcement
for
example
california
currently
has
a
loophole
where
a
car
break-in
with
windows
smashed
and
something
stolen
from
inside
is
treated
as
a
misdemeanour
unless
it
can
be
proved
that
the
car
was
definitely
locked
lawmakers
are
also
considering
tweaking
a
law
to
make
it
easier
to
prosecute
people
for
serial
theft
from
shops
including
those
who
act
in
concert
with
others
cleaning
up
san
francisco
will
not
be
easy
failure
to
do
so
will
carry
big
consequences
for
the
city
and
its
residents
tourists
contribute
around
bn
a
year
to
san
francisco's
economy
and
are
frequent
victims
of
theft
at
least
one
large
conference
has
cancelled
its
plans
to
host
a
big
gathering
in
san
francisco
because
its
participants
expressed
concern
about
their
safety
depriving
the
city
of
around
m
in
spending
would
san
francisco
ever
embrace
a
zero-tolerance
plan
as
new
york
city
did
in
the
s
it
seems
unlikely
but
it
also
seems
unlikely
that
san
francisco
can
keep
going
the
way
it
is
either
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
