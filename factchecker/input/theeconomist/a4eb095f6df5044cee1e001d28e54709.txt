new
york's
proposed
bottle
bill
may
actually
hurt
recycling
scavengers
will
benefit
at
the
expense
of
municipal
programmes
juan
is
grateful
for
new
york's
bottle
bill
which
imposes
a
refundable
nickel
deposit
on
bottles
and
cans
of
water
soda
and
beer
he
and
his
wife
earn
about
a
week
by
collecting
empties
from
recycling
bins
bars
and
restaurants
in
bushwick
brooklyn
which
they
trade
for
money
at
a
local
redemption
centre
their
jangling
cart
is
among
the
many
that
helped
the
state
recycle
over
bn
drinks
containers
in
new
york's
governor
andrew
cuomo
now
wants
to
expand
the
bill
to
cover
most
non-alcoholic
containers
to
help
fight
litter
and
boost
recycling
throughout
the
state
juan
and
his
wife
are
delighted
companies
that
handle
the
state's
recycling
however
are
howling
most
municipal
recycling
programmes
work
because
the
costs
of
collecting
and
sorting
recyclables
are
largely
offset
by
the
value
of
these
materials
on
commodity
markets
but
china
once
the
leading
buyer
of
america's
recyclables
upended
these
markets
last
year
by
banning
most
waste
imports
prices
for
scrap
paper
cardboard
and
plastic
have
plunged
recycling
companies
that
once
turned
a
tidy
profit
are
now
losing
money
and
sending
material
to
landfills
local
governments
are
debating
whether
to
cancel
their
recycling
services
or
charge
residents
for
what
had
always
been
free
some
argue
that
bottle
bills
offer
a
handy
way
to
boost
recycling
without
adding
real
costs
in
the
ten
states
where
container
deposits
are
already
in
effect
most
of
them
introduced
well
before
municipal
recycling
began
they
reduce
litter
raise
recovery
rates
and
create
a
cleaner
stream
of
recyclables
says
susan
collins
of
the
container
recycling
institute
an
advocacy
group
unredeemed
deposits
often
help
pad
state
coffers
new
york
for
example
earns
around
m
in
revenue
from
its
bottle
bill
every
year
the
problem
is
that
these
bills
encourage
people
to
divert
valuable
materials
like
aluminium
and
pet
plastic
away
from
kerbside
bins
to
a
separate
system
run
primarily
by
beverage
manufacturers
and
distributors
this
not
only
creates
inefficiencies
more
trucks
more
bureaucracy
but
also
shrinks
revenues
for
recycling
companies
left
with
less
valuable
materials
tom

has
a
long-term
contract
to
process
all
the
metal
glass
and
plastic
collected
by
new
york
city's
sanitation
department
says
new
york's
current
bill
introduced
in
already
cuts
the
value
of
every
tonne
of
material
sims
receives
by
he
estimates
that
the
governor's
expanded
bill
could
cost
another
per
tonne
the
new
york
state
association
for
reduction
reuse
and
recycling
estimates
that
the
expanded
bill
would
cost
recyclers
m
in
lost
commodity
value
on
top
of
m
in
new
costs
because
of
china-related
turmoil
instead
of
putting
a
bounty
on
materials
that
recycling
companies
need
to
stay
afloat
eric
goldstein
of
the
natural
resources
defence
council
a
conservation
group
recommends
placing
redemption
values
on
things
that
are
difficult
to
recycle
such
as
more
glass
wine
and
liquor
bottles
for
example
batteries
paints
and
carpets
collecting
these
materials
will
not
be
easy
but
at
least
it
will
spare
local
recycling
operators
a
financial
headache
china's
