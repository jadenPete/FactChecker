young
apple
trees
are
dying
and
no
one
understands
why
how
do
you
like
them
apples
chris
baugher's
great-grandfather
first
planted
apple
trees
in
adams
county
pennsylvania
in
in
mr
baugher
planted
fuji
apple
trees
in
the
orchard
which
supplies
apples
to
market
and
for
making
apple
sauce
three
years
later
just
when
the
trees
should
have
been
bearing
fruit
he
noticed
that
a
few
of
them
had
yellow
leaves
within
weeks
they
were
dead
the
next
year
the
problem
had
spread
to
more
than
a
few
trees
by
last
year
of
mr
baugher's
new
trees
were
dead
mr
baugher
has
the
worst
case
of
rapid
apple
decline
rad
in
the
county
but
he
is
not
alone
the
mysterious
disease
has
been
plaguing
growers
across
america's
north-east
in
north
carolina
and
in
canada
for
at
least
six
years
science
a
magazine
reports
that
up
to
of
north
carolina's
orchards
may
have
been
affected
kari
peter
a
fruit-tree
pathologist
at
penn
state
university
first
observed
massive
die-offs
in
her
research
orchard
in
she
came
up
with
the
term
rad
but
her
attempts
to
explain
it
have
not
produced
much
fruit
the
usual
reasons
for
the
death
of
a
tree
mould
infestation
a
known
virus
blight
fungi
an
early
frost
didn't
fit
the
symptoms
her
investigation
only
ruled
things
out
the
dead
trees
tend
to
be
younger
two-
to
eight-years-old
they
are
nearing
the
prime
of
production
dwarf
trees
which
are
commonly
used
by
commercial
growers
seem
to
be
the
most
susceptible
historically
orchards
held
apple
trees
an
acre
but
most
are
now
under
high-producing
dwarf
trees
which
are
more
compact
growers
now
plant
trees
per
acre
commercial
apple
trees
typically
have
two
parts
the
scion
the
apple
variety
such
as
gala
or
honeycrisp
and
the
rootstock
the
trunk
base
and
roots
of
the
tree
the
scion
is
grafted
onto
the
rootstock
where
the
two
join
is
the
tree's
most
vulnerable
spot
and
where
the
decline
appears
to
originate
although
the
rootstock
is
healthy
ms
peter
says
one
sort
of
rootstock
known
as
malling
is
the
most
affected
working
with
the
research
arm
of
the
department
of
agriculture
she
found
a
new
latent
apple
virus
in
the
infected
trees
but
they
cannot
be
sure
if
this
new
virus
has
any
connection
with
the
decline
researchers
at
cornell
university
led
by
awais
khan
published
a
paper
last
month
examining
the
role
of
soil
weather
fungi
and
bacteria
they
found
that
severe
cold
followed
by
drought
could
have
weakened
the
trees
leaving
them
susceptible
to
pathogens
or
boring-insect
infestation
mr
khan
says
more
research
is
needed
other
scientists
speculate
that
herbicides
may
be
to
blame
dan
donahue
a
fruit-tree
specialist
at
cornell
university's
co-operative
extension
says
it
could
be
any
or
all
of
those
theories
he
speculates
that
quality
control
could
be
a
basic
cause
in
a
recent
sampling
he
found
that
of
young
trees
had
latent
viruses
these
do
not
show
symptoms
but
they
could
affect
vitality
older
larger
apple
trees
were
better
at
shrugging
off
the
viruses
rad
is
a
big
worry
for
the
bn
apple
industry
mark
seetin
of
usapple
association
a
trade
group
says
his
growers
are
concerned
trade
wars
have
already
upset
the
apple
cart
mexico
america's
largest
export
market
has
imposed
a
tariff
on
american
apples
and
customer
taste
is
changing
traditional
varieties
like
red
delicious
are
no
longer
a
customer
favourite
so
growers
are
having
to
invest
in
new
varieties
most
orchard
growers
operate
on
very
tight
margins
few
are
able
to
absorb
the
losses
stemming
from
more
typical
causes
such
as
bad
weather
an
infestation
or
a
known
pathogen
never
mind
unexplained
ones
like
rad
mr
baugher
found
some
relief
in
the
tree
assistance
programme
through
which
the
federal
government
provides
financial
assistance
to
orchard-owners
and
nursery
owners
whose
trees
are
damaged
by
natural
disasters
the
sudden
death
of
apple
trees
may
not
seem
as
dramatic
as
a
hurricane
but
in
its
insidiousness
it
is
perhaps
even
more
dangerous
americans
have
given
considerably
more
before
in
the
defence
of
apple
pie
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
