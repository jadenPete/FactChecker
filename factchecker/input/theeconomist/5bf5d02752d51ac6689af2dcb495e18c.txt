bernie
sanders
jumps
into
a
crowded
pool
his
success
in
pulling
democrats
to
the
left
may
be
his
undoing
bernie
sanders
the
self-declared
socialist
senator
from
vermont
had
a
good
long
run
against
hillary
clinton
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
his
left-wing
pitch
has
fared
even
better
slogans
that
were
lampooned
then
medicare
for
all
a
nationwide
minimum
wage
free
tuition
at
public
colleges
are
now
mainstream
among
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
fealty
to
these
mantras
can
even
seem
mandatory
in
his
announcement
video
an
minute
monologue
mr
sanders
sounded
triumphant
three
years
ago
during
our
campaign
when
we
brought
forth
our
progressive
agenda
we
were
told
that
our
ideas
were
radical
and
they
were
extreme
mr
sanders
says
well
three
years
have
come
and
gone
he
sees
a
successful
run
in
as
a
coda
to
his
revolution
the
antagonists
remain
the
same
this
time
round
billionaires
especially
president
donald
trump
multinational
companies
bad
trade
deals
but
mr
sanders
also
seems
keen
to
talk
about
sexism
towards
women
and
racism
against
blacks
two
groups
that
did
not
warm
to
him
in
this
time
he
enters
a
busy
field
with
an
agenda
that
is
no
longer
outlandish
elizabeth
warren
a
massachusetts
senator
is
another
longtime
idol
of
the
left
who
brings
other
flashy
ideas
such
as
a
wealth
tax
and
universal
child-care
along
with
a
stronger
command
of
detail
even
kamala
harris
the
californian
senator
who
took
pains
to
say
that
she
is
not
a
democratic
socialist
has
nonetheless
endorsed
medicare
for
all
the
green
new
deal
and
a
minimum
wage
mr
sanders
may
stand
out
with
his
broadsides
against
banks
and
trade
deals
but
his
ideological
lane
has
become
uncomfortably
crowded
what
that
means
for
his
chances
of
winning
is
unclear
if
democratic
primary
voters
are
looking
for
a
contest
over
ideological
purity
then
mr
sanders
as
the
medicare-for-all
hipster
who
supported
the
idea
before
it
was
cool
is
favourably
positioned
he
is
performing
well
in
early
polls
on
the
morning
of
his
announcement
punters
on
predictit
a
political-betting
market
thought
him
a
leading
candidate
trailing
only
ms
harris
and
joe
biden
who
has
not
yet
announced
his
plans
they
rated
him
twice
as
likely
to
be
the
candidate
as
ms
warren
but
if
voters
prize
electability
mr
sanders
has
less
of
a
chance
even
if
there
is
now
little
daylight
between
him
and
his
primary
rivals
the
label
of
out-and-out
socialist
could
hinder
him
mr
trump's
strategists
see
fear-mongering
over
socialism
as
a
winning
strategy
his
re-election
campaign
quickly
released
a
statement
denouncing
an
agenda
of
sky-high
tax
rates
government-run
health
care
and
coddling
dictators
like
those
in
venezuela
if
elected
mr
sanders
would
be
inaugurated
at
the
spry
age
of
his
democratic
rivals
might
be
too
courteous
to
bring
that
up
but
mr
trump
though
just
five
years
younger
surely
would
in
an
interview
with
a
local
radio
station
mr
sanders
was
eager
to
tackle
that
criticism
we
have
got
to
look
at
candidates
not
by
the
colour
of
their
skin
not
by
their
sexual
orientation
or
by
gender
and
not
by
their
age
he
also
noted
that
he
has
a
great
deal
of
energy
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
