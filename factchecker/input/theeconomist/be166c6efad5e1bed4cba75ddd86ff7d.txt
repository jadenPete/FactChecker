baseball
and
american
exceptionalism
the
national
pastime
reflects
america's
easily
mocked
but
often
successful
desire
to
be
different
you
might
not
get
this
crazy
game
warned
tom
heitz
a
historian
before
attempting
to
induct
a
crowd
of
baseball
scholars
into
the
mysteries
of
town
ball
an
early
form
of
baseball
played
in
north-eastern
states
until
around
the
s
town
ball
is
recognisable
to
modern
americans
by
its
rounded
bat
four
bases
or
stakes
and
the
batsman's
need
to
get
around
them
yet
the
fact
that
he
may
hit
all
around
the
plate
must
run
if
he
so
much
as
foul-tips
the
ball
and
that
fielders
wear
no
protective
glove
was
perplexing
to
some
of
the
scholars
as
the
crowd
divided
into
two
teams
on
the
grounds
of
james
fenimore
cooper's
garden
in
cooperstown
new
york
this
gave
lexington
a
sly
advantage
though
he
had
never
played
baseball
he
had
played
cricket
and
rounders
two
english
games
to
which
town
ball
is
closely
related
it
follows
that
baseball
is
a
close
cousin
to
them
too
which
has
been
even
more
confounding
to
the
game's
aficionados
indeed
the
baseball
hall
of
fame
in
cooperstown
whose
annual
symposium
on
baseball
and
american
culture
the
town-ballers
were
attending
is
testament
to
the
lengths
americans
have
gone
to
to
deny
their
national
pastime's
foreign
roots
to
this
day
many
of
the
thousands
who
visit
the
museum
to
stand
in
awe
before
a
bust
of
babe
ruth
or
jackie
robinson
believe
baseball
was
invented
in
cooperstown
one
day
in
by
abner
doubleday
the
symposium's
participants
were
wise
to
that
hoax
of
course
but
not
entirely
to
a
related
myth
many
believed
baseball's
th-century
rise
to
displace
cricket
formerly
america's
most
popular
game
was
propelled
by
its
singularly
american
qualities
that
is
another
sort
of
nonsense
and
both
sorts
are
revealing
as
is
the
way
with
baseball
of
broader
national
traits
baseball's
rise
from
a
village-green
activity
with
tangled
roots
in
english
games
to
one
of
the
first
professional
sports
was
propelled
by
elite
organisers
and
entrepreneurs
in
america's
growing
cities
such
as
albert
spalding
the
sporting-goods
tycoon
they
saw
the
political
and
commercial
gains
to
be
had
from
promoting
a
uniquely
american
game
they
therefore
raided
cricket
clubs
of
which
there
were
in
philadelphia
alone
for
talent
while
promoting
baseball's
native
qualities
it
was
our
game
the
america
game
crowed
walt
whitman
who
loved
a
national
myth
anglophobia
stirred
by
britain's
trade
with
the
confederacy
during
the
civil
war
and
the
prominence
of
irish-americans
among
early
ballplayers
assisted
this
process
so
did
a
flexible
view
of
what
baseball's
intrinsic
qualities
were
mostly
the
game
was
held
to
be
dynamic
where
cricket
was
languid
yet
at
least
one
commentator
in
the
s
considered
baseball
less
dangerous
the
doubleday
scam
completed
the
mythologising
alarmed
by
the
persistent
claim
that
baseball
evolved
from
rounders
spalding
bankrolled
a
commission
to
produce
a
better
explanation
patriotism
and
research
its
chairman
declared
in
indicated
that
the
game
was
invented
by
doubleday
the
soldier
credited
with
firing
the
first
shot
for
the
union
at
fort
sumter
this
fiction
was
wildly
popular
and
still
is
the
hall
of
fame
acknowledges
on
a
plaque
in
its
inner
sanctum
that
the
doubleday
myth
is
untrue
yet
the
fact
that
the
plaque
also
describes
cooperstown
as
baseball's
spiritual
home
helps
keep
its
spirit
alive
there
are
two
major
morals
to
this
history
the
first
is
that
america
is
less
exceptional
because
like
baseball
more
of
a
european-accented
hybrid
than
it
often
considers
itself
to
be
and
there
are
costs
to
that
self-deception
including
as
the
flip-side
of
american
exceptionalism
isolation
in
sport
and
otherwise
few
americans
will
be
aware
that
ten
finalist
countries
are
currently
contesting
the
quadrennial
cricket
world
cup
followed
by
bn
people
in
those
countries
alone
baseball
which
has
spread
more
modestly
and
remains
fundamentally
a
domestic
game
is
parochial
by
comparison
yet
america's
belief
in
its
exceptionalism
exaggerated
as
it
may
be
is
at
the
heart
of
the
country's
achievements
it
may
be
baseball
suggests
their
essential
feature
that
is
not
merely
because
the
game
reflects
the
triumphs
and
tensions
of
the
society
that
plays
it
all
national
sports
do
that
thus
brazilian
football
and
indian
cricket
represent
the
binding
of
disparate
peoples
by
a
common
culture
and
the
problems
that
plague
them
brazilian
football
is
riven
with
inequality
as
brazil
is
indian
cricket
is
factional
and
corrupt
that
american
baseball
is
the
story
of
america
over
the
past
years
a
common
endeavour
marred
by
periodic
storms
between
communities
between
capital
and
labour
inside
and
outside
the
ballpark
is
in
that
sense
momentous
but
unsurprising
what
sets
it
apart
is
the
cultural
heights
to
which
the
game's
mythologising
has
lifted
it
this
is
most
obvious
in
its
literature
from
the
novels
of
bernard
malamud
and
philip
roth
to
the
non-fiction
of
roger
kahn
and
michael
lewis
american
sports-writing
is
generally
superior
because
america
takes
popular
culture
so
seriously
the
gathering
of
academics
to
a
conference
on
baseball
was
another
sign
of
that
yet
the
boundless
themes
of
national
identity
striving
and
becoming
of
real
and
imagined
americas
and
more
that
flow
from
baseball's
unique
status
make
its
canon
the
richest
by
far
they
are
also
reflected
in
the
game's
popularity
especially
among
those
with
the
most
detached
view
of
america
the
millions
of
immigrants
who
have
arrived
over
baseball's
history
for
jews
mexicans
irish
among
others
baseball
has
been
a
point
of
entry
to
american
culture
roth
called
it
this
game
that
i
loved
with
all
my
heart
not
simply
for
the
fun
of
playing
it
but
for
the
mythic
and
aesthetic
dimension
that
it
gave
to
an
american
boy's
life
particularly
to
one
whose
grandparents
could
hardly
speak
english
baseball
is
a
fun
game
indeed
and
also
as
the
english
say
of
cricket
more
than
a
game
it
is
a
symbol
of
americans
belief
in
their
own
extraordinariness
it
also
represents
what
a
splendidly
self-fulfilling
prophecy
that
delusion
has
often
turned
out
to
be
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
