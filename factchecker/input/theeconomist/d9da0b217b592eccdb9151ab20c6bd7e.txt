tech
giants
face
new
threats
from
the
government
and
regulators
congress
prosecutors
and
bureaucrats
are
in
the
mood
to
move
fast
and
break-up
things
anniversaries
are
often
happy
occasions
but
not
this
one
march
th
will
mark
a
year
since
the
new
york
times
and
the
observer
published
expos
s
about
how
facebook
enabled
the
personal
data
of
tens
of
millions
of
facebook-users
to
leak
to
an
outside
political
firm
cambridge
analytica
the
resulting
scandal
has
plagued
the
social-networking
firm
and
provoked
scepticism
among
politicians
and
consumers
that
big
tech
firms
can
be
trusted
to
police
themselves
many
republicans
and
democrats
who
share
little
in
common
ideologically
agree
that
the
tech
giants
need
to
be
reined
in
software
may
be
eating
the
world
as
the
technology
investor
marc
andreessen
famously
said
but
the
world
is
starting
to
bite
back
says
bruce
mehlman
a
lobbyist
in
washington
elizabeth
warren
a
senator
vying
to
become
the
democratic
nominee
for
president
recently
suggested
breaking
up
big
tech
companies
including
facebook
google
and
amazon
and
unwinding
some
of
their
previously
allowed
mergers
such
as
facebook's
purchases
of
the
apps
instagram
and
whatsapp
she
has
declared
that
big
tech
firms
have
too
much
power
over
our
economy
our
society
and
our
democracy
as
if
to
underscore
her
concern
facebook
temporarily
blocked
some
of
ms
warren's
anti-tech
advertisements
from
appearing
on
the
social
network
reportedly
because
of
trademark
issues
with
facebook's
logo
before
they
were
restored
nor
is
this
animus
confined
to
democrats
ted
cruz
a
republican
senator
from
texas
says
ms
warren
is
right
that
big
tech
has
too
much
power
to
silence
free
speech
and
is
a
serious
threat
to
our
democracy
mr
cruz
added
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
agreed
with
ms
warren
about
anything
much
as
wall
street
animated
the
presidential
election
antitrust
will
feature
prominently
in
the
campaign
amy
klobuchar
another
senator
and
presidential
hopeful
has
sponsored
bills
that
would
toughen
america's
antitrust
laws
for
example
by
requiring
merging
firms
to
prove
their
deals
would
not
harm
competition
ms
warren's
views
on
tech
will
oblige
other
democratic
candidates
to
clarify
where
they
stand
and
may
drag
other
candidates
towards
more
extreme
positions
as
her
stance
on
wealth
taxes
did
it
does
not
require
a
sophisticated
algorithm
to
detect
a
growing
unease
with
big
tech
firms
this
month
at
south
by
southwest
a
conference
in
austin
that
attracts
many
techies
margrethe
vestager
the
european
commissioner
for
competition
who
has
led
the
way
on
punishing
tech
firms
for
anti-competitive
behaviour
asked
whether
there
should
be
more
government
intervention
against
them
most
of
the
several
hundred
people
in
the
room
raised
their
hands
how
best
to
take
on
tech
is
a
conundrum
facing
many
governments
a
new
report
by
a
panel
of
experts
led
by
the
harvard
economist
jason
furman
which
was
published
on
march
th
looks
at
how
britain
can
encourage
digital
competition
it
recommends
a
series
of
things
including
developing
a
code
of
conduct
for
tech
firms
tweaking
merger
rules
making
it
easier
for
customers
to
move
their
data
to
rival
firms
and
creating
a
new
competition
unit
with
technology
expertise
but
britain's
ability
to
tame
tech
firms
is
limited
far
more
responsibility
falls
on
america
the
homeland
of
big
tech
democrats
and
republicans
may
both
poke
at
tech
but
they
often
have
different
worries
democrats
are
more
interested
in
issues
of
market
power
and
privacy
republicans
share
their
concerns
about
privacy
but
focus
less
on
antitrust
and
more
on
the
supposed
political
bias
of
firms
like
google
and
facebook
which
they
believe
suppress
conservative
views
however
in
the
year
since
the
cambridge
analytica
scandal
neither
party
can
claim
much
has
been
done
yet
to
constrain
big
tech
firms
could
that
be
changing
the
federal
trade
commission
ftc
a
consumer
watchdog
is
believed
to
be
nearing
completion
of
its
investigation
into
whether
the
cambridge
analytica
fiasco
is
evidence
that
facebook
violated
a
agreement
not
to
share
data
without
consumers
express
consent
some
think
a
massive
fine
perhaps
as
high
as
bn
could
be
forthcoming
the
effectiveness
of
the
ftc
is
is
going
to
be
weighed
to
a
large
degree
by
their
actions
on
facebook
says
barry
lynn
of
the
open
markets
institute
a
think-tank
that
argues
for
more
forceful
use
of
antitrust
laws
the
ftc
has
also
launched
a
task-force
focused
specifically
on
tech
firms
which
could
play
a
role
in
unwinding
past
tech
mergers
separately
federal
prosecutors
are
reported
to
be
considering
a
criminal
investigation
into
facebook's
sharing
of
data
with
other
firms
another
place
to
watch
for
signs
of
tech
firms
falling
under
tighter
control
is
federal
privacy
legislation
which
is
currently
being
drafted
in
washington
dc
senators
are
weighing
how
best
to
write
a
national
bill
which
would
give
consumers
greater
control
over
how
their
data
are
collected
and
used
online
california
forced
the
federal
government's
hand
by
drafting
and
passing
its
own
privacy
law
which
goes
into
effect
in
january
most
businesses
don't
want
a
patchwork
of
state
laws
that
are
hard
to
implement
and
make
no
sense
says
jon
leibowitz
former
chairman
of
the
ftc
who
is
now
a
lawyer
at
davis
polk
a
new
federal
privacy
bill
seems
unlikely
in
the
short
term
but
never
before
has
there
been
so
much
consensus
about
the
need
for
privacy
legislation
says
mr
leibowitz
the
other
principal
worry
is
that
big
tech
firms
suppress
competition
that
can
be
addressed
by
enforcing
antitrust
law
america
has
not
brought
a
big
antitrust
case
against
a
tech
giant
for
years
since
it
went
after
microsoft
for
anti-competitive
behaviour
those
in
favour
of
the
big
case
tradition
of
antitrust
as
ms
warren
is
believe
that
break-up
attempts
even
if
they
are
not
ultimately
successful
put
tech
firms
on
guard
and
can
allow
innovative
upstarts
to
thrive
while
the
giant
is
distracted
by
court
cases
proponents
of
this
school
of
thought
point
out
that
new
firms
arose
after
government
actions
against
at
t
ibm
and
microsoft
but
not
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
a
good
idea
to
try
to
break
up
tech
firms
it
is
better
to
prevent
mergers
happening
in
the
first
place
than
attempt
to
untangle
them
after
the
fact
a
big
move
against
a
tech
giant
seems
unlikely
until
after
but
even
if
the
elected
president
does
not
have
ms
warren's
enthusiasm
for
breaking
up
these
companies
there
could
be
pressure
to
do
so
state
attorneys-general
are
increasingly
agitating
to
take
action
against
big
tech
firms
over
privacy
infringements
and
anti-competitive
behaviour
there
are
rumours
that
some
have
singled
out
facebook
if
they
band
together
attorneys-general
could
hurt
tech
firms
and
provoke
action
by
the
federal
government
just
as
they
did
launching
investigations
and
going
on
to
pressure
the
government
in
the
cases
against
big
tobacco
and
microsoft
that
started
in
the
s
in
the
coming
year
antitrust
policy
and
tech
regulation
will
be
debated
fiercely
but
will
not
be
the
first
election
in
which
antitrust
policy
will
play
a
role
the
issue
famously
featured
in
when
the
contenders
talked
about
the
powerful
companies
of
their
day
called
trusts
and
whether
they
should
be
dismembered
woodrow
wilson
who
believed
there
needed
to
be
new
legislation
to
strengthen
antitrust
enforcement
beat
the
more
cautious
theodore
roosevelt
to
the
presidency
today's
contenders
may
want
to
take
note
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
