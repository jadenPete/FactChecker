nebraska
faces
a
prison-crowding
emergency
longer
sentences
for
violent
crimes
are
why
prisons
are
full
in
a
prison
in
nebraska
was
taken
over
by
its
inmates
for
several
hours
two
were
killed
before
staff
regained
control
the
riot
was
worsened
by
the
fact
that
the
state's
prisons
were
horrifically
overcrowded
nobody
was
surprised
it
happened
says
jason
witmer
who
was
serving
a
year
sentence
for
robbery
and
home
invasion
at
the
time
trying
to
contain
things
they
got
more
restrictive
then
the
restrictions
became
new
norms
that
year
the
nebraska
legislature
unanimously
passed
a
sentencing-reform
bill
that
was
designed
among
other
things
to
ease
that
overcrowding
it
was
forecast
to
get
the
prison
population
down
to
around
people
or
of
capacity
by
four
years
later
however
things
are
worse
nebraska's
prison
system
today
holds
more
people
than
it
ever
has
seven
of
its
ten
prisons
are
stuffed
to
more
than
of
their
designed
capacity
its
most
crowded
holds
more
than
three
times
as
many
inmates
as
it
should
if
the
situation
does
not
improve
by
july
st
the
governor
will
have
to
declare
an
emergency
that
would
impel
officials
to
consider
immediate
parole
for
all
eligible
inmates
between
and
america's
imprisonment
rate
fell
by
some
hope
that
the
era
of
mass
incarceration
that
began
in
the
s
may
be
nearing
its
end
but
nebraska's
troubles
show
that
reducing
prison
populations
is
not
always
as
simple
as
mustering
political
will
the
state's
legislature
judiciary
and
multiple
governors
have
all
agreed
that
they
need
to
trim
its
prison
population
to
no
avail
nebraska
illustrates
the
complex
incentives
at
work
in
america's
harsh
penal
system
the
state's
sentencing-reform
bill
failed
to
work
as
intended
for
several
reasons
one
aim
was
to
improve
parole
and
post-release
supervision
to
reduce
the
risk
of
reoffending
the
bill
ruled
that
people
who
violate
the
terms
of
their
parole
should
be
returned
to
prison
for
brief
periods
rather
than
as
often
happened
the
duration
of
their
sentences
but
according
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
of
nebraska
the
number
of
people
returning
to
prison
for
parole
revocations
rose
by
between
and
the
bill
also
did
nothing
to
change
a
principal
driver
of
prison
population
long
sentences
for
felonies
most
americans
agree
that
non-violent
drug
offenders
are
better
served
by
treatment
than
prison
in
recent
years
nebraska
has
expanded
its
use
of
drug
courts
for
just
that
reason
but
violent
crimes
pose
a
more
difficult
political
problem
few
hot-headed
young
men
remain
so
into
middle
age
keeping
people
locked
up
for
decades
is
not
an
effective
way
of
reducing
crime
but
arguing
that
murderers
should
spend
less
time
in
prison
carries
immense
political
risks
in
nebraska
the
average
length
of
sentence
rose
by
from
to
almost
entirely
as
a
result
of
longer
sentences
for
violent
crimes
the
state's
habitual
criminal
statute
imposes
a
mandatory-minimum
sentence
of
at
least
ten
and
up
to
years
for
a
third
conviction
on
any
felony
prosecutors
like
such
laws
because
they
help
to
compel
suspects
to
co-operate
but
they
keep
people
in
prison
far
longer
than
public
safety
dictates
they
also
push
back
a
prisoner's
parole
eligibility
as
does
persistent
understaffing
in
nebraska
prisoners
become
eligible
for
parole
after
completing
half
of
their
sentences
minimum
term
however
they
also
have
to
complete
rehabilitation
programmes
such
as
anger-management
or
substance-abuse
counselling
in
order
to
be
released
high
turnover
and
staff
shortages
mean
that
the
state
has
too
few
counsellors
to
teach
those
programmes
and
often
too
few
guards
to
transport
prisoners
a
booming
economy
does
perverse
damage
in
rural
areas
where
prisons
usually
are
workers
are
scarce
the
state
has
been
busing
people
to
its
maximum-security
prison
in
tecumseh
from
omaha
more
than
minutes
away
staff
shortages
can
become
self-sustaining
mandatory
overtime
lowers
morale
which
increases
turnover
nebraska
pays
its
prison
employees
more
than
neighbouring
states
do
but
county
jails
often
pay
more
with
better
conditions
in
state
prisons
working
double
eight-hour
shifts
many
times
a
week
is
common
union
officials
complain
about
inadequate
pay
increases
for
seniority
few
believe
nebraska
will
be
able
to
avoid
having
to
declare
an
emergency
next
year
the
aclu
has
sued
nebraska
arguing
that
its
prison
conditions
violate
the
eighth
amendment's
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
a
similar
argument
led
the
supreme
court
to
order
california
to
cut
its
prison
population
and
on
april
nd
the
justice
department
found
that
staff
shortages
and
overcrowding
contributed
to
unconstitutional
conditions
in
alabama's
prisons
pete
ricketts
the
state's
governor
talks
of
changing
the
culture
to
help
our
inmates
get
back
to
society
his
proposed
budget
includes
m
for
increasing
prison
staffing
and
rehabilitation
programmes
he
also
wants
m
to
build
two
new
high-security
units
with
an
additional
beds
at
a
prison
in
lincoln
the
state
capital
but
even
if
they
were
available
and
filled
tomorrow
nebraska
would
still
run
at
of
designed
capacity
ultimately
reducing
prison
overcrowding
requires
more
than
just
building
more
cells
states
have
to
make
a
concerted
effort
to
send
fewer
people
to
prison
for
less
time
mike
lawlor
who
helped
engineer
connecticut's
sizeable
decline
in
prison
population
and
now
teaches
law
at
the
university
of
new
haven
says
it
took
a
reassessment
of
risk
we
said
let's
figure
out
who
the
dangerous
people
are
and
reserve
our
incarceration
for
them
shorter
sentences
were
a
large
part
of
the
reform
since
connecticut's
prison
population
has
declined
by
its
to-
year-old
population
has
fallen
by
more
than
the
goal
of
our
public
policy
explains
mr
lawlor
was
to
reduce
crime
maybe
your
goal
is
more
punishment
if
you
do
that
you'll
get
more
crime
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry

up

to
