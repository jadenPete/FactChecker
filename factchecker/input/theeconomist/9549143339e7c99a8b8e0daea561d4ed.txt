what
a
republican
victory
in
north
carolina
means
for
both
parties
may
recalibrate
after
a
close
house
race
up
close
political
enthusiasm
is
gloriously
strange
at
the
rally
held
by
president
donald
trump
in
fayetteville
on
the
eve
of
election
night
in
north
carolina's
th
congressional
district
the
atmosphere
was
festive
i
haven't
been
in
a
crowd
like
this
since
i
saw
fleetwood
mac
said
a
retired
marine
who
was
unaware
that
the
democrat
running
in
the
district
was
also
a
retired
marine
before
the
president
spoke
there
was
discussion
among
other
things
of
whether
it
was
still
ok
to
play
michael
jackson
songs
at
such
an
occasion
i
hope
he
doesn't
come
on
stage
to
this
it's
a
bit
off
it's
probably
just
s
spotify
a
tall
african-american
man
dressed
head-to-toe
in
pyjamas
with
the
president's
face
all
over
them
capped
with
a
trump
wig
lifted
his
top
to
reveal
a
t-shirt
underneath
with
grab
her
by
the
pussy
written
on
it
a
trans
woman
waved
a
banner
that
read
women
for
trump
there
were
speeches
from
the
president's
son
and
from
the
president's
son's
girlfriend
who
said
that
the
trump
family
has
sacrificed
so
much
for
america
because
they
love
the
people
yet
when
it
comes
to
election
time
voters
behave
in
ways
all
too
easy
to
generalise
about
between
the
previous
election
in
north
carolina's
th
district
in
november
and
the
special
election
on
september
th
which
dan
bishop
the
republican
candidate
won
narrowly
the
news
cycle
has
been
dizzying
the
trade
war
with
china
has
intensified
the
mueller
investigation
concluded
the
president
has
sent
tweets
the
net
effect
of
all
this
at
least
in
nc-
was
that
the
republican
increased
his
vote
share
by
one
percentage
point
for
all
the
effort
poured
into
campaigning
and
the
speculation
over
whether
this
or
that
will
hurt
or
help
mr
trump
with
voters
the
overwhelming
majority
of
people
just
voted
for
the
party
they
supported
last
time
such
stability
might
be
a
relief
to
republican
congressmen
art
pope
a
former
republican
state
representative
with
a
fearsome
reputation
among
democrats
as
a
political
operator
reckons
the
result
shows
that
the
democratic
wave
of
is
now
receding
in
he
says
the
democratic
candidate
dan
mccready
the
former
marine
and
current
entrepreneur
was
free
to
define
himself
in
the
eyes
of
voters
a
year
on
with
nancy
pelosi
basking
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
the
socialist
wing
of
the
party
mr
pope
says
it
was
easier
to
pin
him
down
that
interpretation
is
kind
to
republicans
no
democrat
ought
to
have
been
competitive
in
the
district
which
stretches
from
suburban
charlotte
to
fayetteville
in
the
east
the
most
patriotic
city
in
the
usa
is
just
outside
the
gates
of
fort
bragg
a
military
base
which
covers
acres
and
is
home
to
soldiers
and
of
their
family
members
nc-
has
returned
a
republican
in
each
election
since
mr
trump
won
it
by
points
in
yet
the
republican
candidate
would
probably
have
lost
but
for
a
particularly
good
result
in
robeson
county
see
chart
robeson
is
home
to
the
lumbee
tribe
of
native
americans
who
were
courted
by
both
candidates
mr
bishop
overcoming
a
reflexive
republican
aversion
to
handouts
sponsored
a
bill
signed
into
law
in
july
in
north
carolina's
statehouse
to
funnel
money
for
health
care
and
poverty
alleviation
to
the
lumbee
turnout
in
robeson
was
low
because
the
tribe's
members
are
mostly
poor
but
it
may
have
been
decisive
one-off
elections
are
not
always
good
predictors
of
what
comes
next
but
the
mid-term
results
in
were
in
line
with
the
special
elections
that
preceded
them
if
the
democratic
party
were
to
do
as
well
next
year
as
its
candidate
did
in
nc-
it
would
secure
a
huge
majority
in
congress
there
are
seats
currently
held
by
republicans
that
mr
trump
won
by
fewer
than
points
given
democrats
already
have
a
majority
of
a
repeat
of
the
outcome
in
nc-
would
give
them
the
biggest
majority
held
by
either
party
in
the
house
since
the
early
s
for
their
part
the
state's
republicans
are
not
exactly
behaving
like
a
party
that
knows
it
commands
the
support
of
a
majority
of
north
carolinians
the
day
after
the
election
they
pushed
through
an
important
budget
vote
in
the
state
legislature
while
most
of
the
democratic
members
were
at
a
ceremony
to
mark
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
th
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
