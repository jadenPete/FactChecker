tony
evers
seems
to
be
following
scott
walker's
playbook
democrats
are
drawing
battle
lines
in
wisconsin
tony
evers
wisconsin's
governor
and
a
former
teacher
is
so
gently
spoken
you
might
wonder
how
he
used
to
hush
a
class
of
pesky
pupils
a
cancer
survivor
with
a
shock
of
white
hair
he
ran
for
office
promising
to
focus
on
solving
problems
not
picking
fights
his
calm
manner
appealed
to
many
after
eight
years
of
scott
walker
a
republican
governor
who
relished
confrontation
as
he
cut
public
spending
and
battered
unions
but
few
fights
are
now
likely
to
go
unpicked
in
wisconsin
mr
evers
who
took
office
in
january
has
set
out
a
lengthy
list
of
proposals
notably
for
a
two-year
budget
that
will
define
much
of
his
administration
there
are
likely
to
be
months
of
combat
given
the
opposition
from
republicans
who
control
both
the
state
assembly
and
the
senate
the
governor
will
spar
too
for
he
can
veto
legislation
he
dislikes
mr
evers
is
turning
out
to
be
more
combative
than
expected
his
proposals
include
legalising
medical
marijuana
and
decriminalising
its
recreational
use
boosting
renewable
energy
withdrawing
wisconsin's
national
guard
from
deployment
on
america's
southern
border
and
a
plan
to
make
it
easier
for
migrants
including
the
undocumented
to
get
driving
licences
and
access
to
higher
education
he
also
wants
to
scrap
a
right-to-work
law
that
is
much-despised
on
the
left
because
it
lets
those
employed
in
unionised
workplaces
avoid
paying
anything
to
the
union
he
proposes
that
an
independent
commission
should
decide
on
electoral
redistricting
after
a
census
in
rather
than
leaving
it
as
usual
to
the
legislature
the
idea
is
to
reduce
flagrant
gerrymandering
that
favoured
republicans
who
won
of
assembly
seats
in
november
despite
getting
less
than
half
the
votes
and
far
fewer
than
the
democrats
the
average
voter
seems
to
agree
that
this
is
unjust
a
recent
poll
found
that
support
his
plan
for
a
non-partisan
redistricting
body
then
there
are
promises
of
substantial
policy
change
over
of
voters
back
mr
evers's
promise
to
expand
medicaid
to
poor
families
something
mr
walker
doggedly
opposed
some
people
are
expected
to
benefit
many
also
like
his
plans
to
spend
more
after
years
of
austerity
on
roads
and
education
meanwhile
a
cut
in
income
tax
is
promised
for
middle-income
families
funded
by
ending
part
of
a
tax
break
for
manufacturers
higher
tax
on
petrol
should
help
state
finances
though
at
present
these
enjoy
a
surplus
what
explains
mr
evers's
newfound
taste
for
confrontation
some
had
expected
him
to
try
co-operating
with
moderate
republicans
given
his
slender
victory
last
year
dan
kaufman
author
of
the
fall
of
wisconsin
a
damning
and
entertaining
account
of
mr
walker's
eight
years
instead
sees
a
reckoning
under
way
as
mr
evers
undoes
the
many
changes
of
recent
years
people
misread
his
temperament
for
his
policy
agenda
he
doesn't
do
fiery
rhetoric
but
he
is
from
a
good-government
tradition
of
progressive
ideas
he
says
mr
kaufman
adds
that
wisconsin
democrats
like
boldness
noting
that
many
are
populists
who
backed
bernie
sanders
in
voters
in
out
of
counties
preferred
him
to
hillary
clinton
in
the
primary
and
any
urge
to
be
conciliatory
was
undermined
when
republicans
broke
a
democratic
norm
last
year
by
passing
laws
aimed
at
curtailing
the
power
of
the
incoming
governor
after
their
candidate
lost
such
behaviour
invites
retaliation
barry
burden
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
in
madison
sees
mr
evers
learning
from
mr
walker
in
pushing
several
controversial
plans
early
when
his
mandate
is
strongest
it
seems
so
dramatic
and
with
many
moving
parts
it
is
hard
to
focus
as
the
opposition
says
mr
burden
in
the
turmoil
some
measures
such
as
spending
on
education
and
roads
plus
medicaid
expansion
may
pass
as
the
opposition
concentrates
on
blocking
more
controversial
plans
fierce
partisan
scraps
can
bring
other
benefits

locals
this
week

anxiously
to
hear
if
milwaukee
will
host
the
democratic
national
convention
next

that
would
be
interpreted
as
a
signal
that
the
midwest
won't
be
forgotten
in
mr
trump
was
not
popular
in
wisconsin
in
he
won
fewer
votes
than
mitt
romney
had
managed
four
years
earlier
nonetheless
he
carried
the
state
by
a
sliver
a
long
and
noisy
battle
in
wisconsin
state

could
spur
democratic
supporters
to
rally
around
mr
evers

and

later
