nancy
pelosi
launches
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
donald
trump
as
the
trump
administration
stonewalls
congress
democrats
reach
for
their
most
potent
weapon
nancy
pelosi
has
long
been
a
republican
bogeyman
in
republican
congressional
candidates
across
america
built
her
into
a
caricature
of
a
wild-eyed
out-of-touch
coastal
liberal
in
fact
mrs
pelosi
is
among
america's
most
calculating
politicians
that
has
frustrated
some
of
those
on
the
left
of
her
caucus
but
the
leader
of
the
house
of
representatives
knows
that
she
owes
her
majority
to
moderates
from
conservative
districts
for
months
progressives
pushed
to
open
impeachment
proceedings
against
donald
trump
while
mrs
pelosi
urged
caution
on
september
th
though
she
joined
their
calls
announcing
that
the
house
was
moving
forward
with
an
official
impeachment
inquiry
support
for
impeachment
has
spread
from
the
democratic
caucus's
left
flank
to
its
centre
on
the
morning
of
mrs
pelosi's
announcement
the
washington
post
published
an
op-ed
by
seven
moderate
democrats
from
swing
districts
with
military
or
national-security
backgrounds
arguing
that
the
president
may
have
committed
an
impeachable
offence
the
previous
day
adam
schiff
the
reserved
chair
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
said
that
impeachment
may
be
the
only
remedy
to
address
mr
trump's
conduct
actually
impeaching
the
president
remains
a
long
way
off
and
is
by
no
means
certain
but
it
has
moved
from
a
theoretical
to
an
actual
possibility
the
shift
has
been
prompted
by
a
whistleblower's
report
that
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
odni
is
withholding
from
congress
its
precise
contents
are
unknown
but
it
appears
to
concern
mr
trump
allegedly
putting
pressure
on
ukraine
to
launch
a
corruption
investigation
into
hunter
biden
who
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
oil
firm
and
whose
father
joe
is
the
democratic
presidential
front-runner
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
mr
trump
pressed
volodymyr
zelensky
ukraine's
newly-elected
president
eight
times
in
one
phone
call
to
work
with
rudolph
giuliani
the
president's
personal
lawyer
on
a
probe
into
the
younger
mr
biden
according
to
the
washington
post
one
week
before
that
call
mr
trump
ordered
that
m
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
be
withheld
and
administration
officials
were
told
to
lie
about
the
reason
it
was
being
withheld
the
money
was
released
two
months
later
after
a
democratic
senator
threatened
to
freeze
bn
in
pentagon
funding
the
whistleblower's
report
came
to
light
on
september
th
when
mr
schiff
announced
that
he
had
subpoenaed
it
and
all
related
documents
from
joseph
maguire
the
acting
dni
mr
schiff
argues
that
its
withholding
violates
the
intelligence
community
whistleblower
protection
act
that
law
passed
in
states
that
if
a
whistleblower
brings
an
urgent
concern
to
the
office
of
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
icig
and
the
icig
determines
the
complaint
to
be
credible
he
will
forward
it
to
the
odni
which
has
seven
days
to
forward
it
to
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
communities
the
icig
received
a
complaint
on
august
th
determined
it
to
be
credible
then
sent
it
to
the
odni
on
august
th
there
it
has
remained
in
mr
schiff's
words
in
a
manner
neither
permitted
nor
contemplated
under
the
statute
the
odni
contends
that
the
complaint
does
not
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
an
urgent
concern
it
refers
to
conduct
by
someone
outside
the
intelligence
community
hence
unrelated
to
any
intelligence
activity
that
dni
supervises
and
it
therefore
need
not
be
sent
to
congress
the
odni
did
not
reveal
who
someone
was
though
the
president
being
outside
the
intelligence
community
could
fit
the
bill
mr
maguire
will
testify
before
the
house
on
september
th
mr
trump
has
begun
fighting
back
initially
by
offering
a
fusillade
of
denials
and
rationalisations
of
his
behaviour
first
he
said
he
withheld
the
funds
because
he
was
worried
about
corruption
in
ukraine
potentially
a
legitimate
concern
but
presidents
tend
not
to
not
use
their
personal
lawyers
for
anti-corruption
initiatives
he
then
said
he
withheld
aid
because
europe
and
other
nations
did
not
contribute
to
ukraine's
defence
though
that
was
not
a
condition
of
their
appropriation
in
the
space
of
two
sentences
he
denied
putting
pressure
on
ukraine
but
then
admitted
there
was
pressure
put
on
with
respect
to
joe
biden
that
is
one
of
two
arguments
at
the
heart
of
mr
trump's
defence
that
mr
biden
put
pressure
on
ukraine's
former
president
to
get
him
to
fire
a
prosecutor
investigating
his
son
mr
biden
did
urge
ukraine
to
more
effectively
combat
corruption
and
he
urged
the
sacking
of
a
prosecutor-general
whom
america
and
other
western
nations
viewed
as
corrupt
but
that
prosecutor
was
not
investigating
hunter
biden's
firm
and
he
was
fired
as
a
ukrainian
anti-corruption
activist
explained
not
because
he
wanted
to
do
that
investigation
but
because
he
failed
that
investigation
a
ukrainian
court
found
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
at
mr
biden's
firm
so
on
the
face
of
it
mr
trump
was
not
so
much
asking
ukraine
to
dig
up
evidence
as
he
was
demanding
that
they
manufacture
it
hunter
biden
earning
per
month
while
his
father
was
vice-president
is
certainly
unseemly
but
if
it
is
disqualifying
for
a
politician's
children
to
trade
on
his
name
mr
trump
should
look
closer
to
home
mr
trump's
second
argument
is
that
there
was
no
explicit
quid
pro
quo
that
he
never
overtly
made
aid
to
ukraine
conditional
on
its
investigating
mr
biden's
son
but
a
quid
pro
quo
need
not
be
explicitly
stated
only
understood
by
both
parties
and
that
is
not
the
only
impeachable
offence
being
investigated
if
what
is
alleged
is
true
mr
trump
invited
a
foreign
nation
to
interfere
in
an
american
election
and
in
contrast
to
when
he
could
argue
he
was
simply
the
passive
recipient
of
foreign
aid
here
he
initiated
contact
he
leaned
on
a
weaker
country
that
desperately
needed
american
money
to
fend
off
a
stronger
rival
that
had
already
invaded
and
claimed
a
significant
chunk
of
territory
he
used
the
power
of
his
office
and
twisted
american
foreign
policy
for
his
personal
benefit
mr
trump
said
on
september
th
he
would
release
a
transcript
of
his
perfect
call
with
mr
zelensky
but
the
complaint
certainly
concerns
more
than
just
a
single
call
and
democrats
will
remember
that
before
releasing
robert
mueller's
complete
report
mr
trump
dispatched
his
attorney-general
william
barr
to
provide
a
misleading
summary
they
will
no
doubt
fear
a
similar
tactic
this
time
a
couple
of
hours
after
mrs
pelosi's
announcement
the
white
house
relented
and
said
it
would
release
the
whistleblower's
complaint
and
let
the
whistleblower
talk
to
congressional
investigators
but
that
is
just
the
end
of
the
beginning
it
marks
yet
another
misstep
caused
by
mr
trump's
reflexive
hostility
to
oversight
had
the
odni
simply
released
the
report
it
may
well
have
faded
into
the
background
as
evidence
of
just
another
breaking
of
norms
from
a
norm-breaking
president
but
by
starting
a
fight
that
he
has
now
lost
mr
trump
got
everyone
to
focus
on
the
substance
of
the
complaint
democrats
hope
to
decide
on
impeachment
by
the
end
of
the
year
that
augurs
a
busy
next
couple
of
months
for
chairs
of
the
committees
holding
impeachment
hearings
including
jerry
nadler
of
judiciary
elijah
cummings
of
oversight
maxine
waters
of
financial
services
and
adam
schiff
of
intelligence
the
sheer
number
of
mr
trump's
deeds
being
investigated
introduces
a
risk
of
sprawl
mrs
pelosi
will
need
to
keep
her
caucus
focused
and
her
chairmen
on
task
they
will
have
to
prosecute
the
case
before
the
american
people
not
just
preach
to
the
converted
winning
over
republicans
will
be
difficult
but
shortly
before
mrs
pelosi
spoke
the
republican-controlled
senate
voted
that
the
icig
should
release
the
complaint
to
their
intelligence
committee
it
was
a
sense
of
the
senate
resolution
so
it
was
neither
binding
nor
a
law
but
it
passed
unanimously
and
mitch
mcconnell
the
majority
leader
did
not
object
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
