happiness
and
voting
why
picking
a
party
is
like
following
a
sports
team
as
any
sports
fan
will
admit
supporting
your
team
is
agony
not
only
must
all
but
one
side
lose
in
any
competition
but
humans
seem
hard-wired
to
feel
the
pain
of
a
loss
more
keenly
than
the
pleasure
of
a
win
this
phenomenon
is
called
loss
aversion
and
crops
up
in
many
areas
of
life
most
people
would
rather
forgo
the
chance
of
winning
than
risk
losing
even
capuchin
monkeys
it
is
said
show
loss
aversion
a
new
study
by
sergio
pinto
of
the
university
of
maryland
and
others
finds
it
in
american
politics
too
political
engagement
is
correlated
with
happiness
that
may
seem
hard
to
believe
at
a
time
when
most
political
activity
seems
to
increase
the
sum
of
human
misery
but
the
recent
world
happiness
report
an
annual
survey
backed
by
the
un
lays
out
compelling
evidence
a
sample
of
american
respondents
shows
a
link
between
reported
levels
of
life
satisfaction
and
turnout
at
elections
even
when
controlling
for
age
and
income
in
britain
the
propensity
to
vote
rises
as
people
become
happier
perhaps
this
explains
why
british
turnout
went
down
steadily
for
decades
a
study
from
in
the
review
of
economic
studies
found
that
people
are
considerably
happier
when
the
party
they
support
is
in
power
it
is
not
clear
why
these
two
things
should
be
linked
it
could
be
that
people
who
are
unhappy
about
their
lives
are
more
likely
to
be
dissatisfied
with
the
political
system
and
opt
out
or
the
two
factors
could
be
linked
to
a
third
which
influences
voting
such
as
marriage
married
people
report
higher
levels
of
happiness
and
vote
more
reliably
or
perhaps
voting
just
makes
people
happier
charitable
giving
and
altruism
certainly
make
people
feel
better
about
themselves
studies
have
found
this
is
true
even
for
infants
perhaps
engaging
in
politics
has
a
similar
effect
whatever
the
reason
the
impact
of
happiness
on
political
engagement
is
substantial
in
america
it
has
as
big
an
effect
on
voting
as
education
does
in
both
cases
the
higher
the
level
the
higher
the
turnout
so
it
was
more
surprising
than
it
might
appear
when
mr
pinto
and
his
colleagues
found
that
the
two
recent
presidential
elections
have
produced
a
net
decrease
in
american
happiness
the
day
after
the
vote
in
saw
a
big
and
understandable
crash
in
the
reported
life
satisfaction
of
democrats
two
months
later
democrats
were
still
more
miserable
than
they
had
been
before
the
vote
there
was
an
offsetting
rise
in
republican
satisfaction
but
it
was
only
a
third
as
large
as
the
democratic
fall
and
it
dissipated
quickly
on
some
measures
such
as
people's
expectations
about
the
election's
impact
on
their
community
republicans
became
more
pessimistic
as
with
happiness
and
voting
the
trump
effect
was
substantial
the
reduction
in
democrats
current
and
expected
life
satisfaction
was
as
large
as
that
which
happens
when
people
lose
their
jobs
or
get
health
problems
which
prevent
normal
activities
the
results
cannot
be
explained
away
as
based
on
poor
data
they
are
drawn
from
a
large
sample
and
from
unusually
detailed
data
by
gallup
healthways
which
surveys
people
a
month
so
what
is
the
explanation
there
are
three
possibilities
not
mutually
exclusive
it's
very
much
a
loss-aversion
story
says
carol
graham
of
the
brookings
institution
a
think-tank
who
is
one
of
the
study's
authors
on
the
african
savannah
early
humans
benefited
only
a
little
from
an
extra
meal
but
might
starve
if
they
missed
one
so
they
evolved
to
avoid
potential
losses
in
contemporary
politics
loss
aversion
may
moderate
the
happiness
effect
next
donald
trump
magnifies
the
impact
as
an
iconoclast
surprise
winner
and
self-declared
offender
against
all
things
liberals
hold
dear
mr
trump
was
always
likely
to
make
democrats
more
upset
than
any
other
republican
victor
would
have
done
on
the
republican
side
a
study
in
by
jeph
herrin
of
the
yale
school
of
medicine
found
that
counties
which
voted
for
mr
trump
had
lower
levels
of
reported
well-being
than
average
and
saw
big
falls
in
that
well-being
between
and
perhaps
mr
trump's
victory
simply
meant
that
these
areas
reverted
to
the
mean
third
different
dimensions
of
happiness
seem
to
matter
psychologists
distinguish
between
evaluative
and
hedonic
well-being
evaluative
means
how
you
assess
your
life
are
you
very
happy
somewhat
happy
and
so
on
hedonic
well-being
refers
to
specific
emotions
did
you
experience
stress
enjoyment
or
anger
yesterday
evaluative
well-being
is
more
stable
than
the
hedonic
kind
it
is
possible
that
the
political
system
and
basic
democratic
procedures
being
part
of
people's
long-term
make-up
influence
feelings
of
evaluative
happiness
which
do
not
change
so
much
whereas
the
results
of
particular
polls
trigger
more
volatile
emotions
of
anger
worry
and
stress
that
suggests
that
if
picking
a
party
is
like
following
a
sports
team
political
engagement
is
more
akin
to
liking
sports
in
general
if
so
the
current
president
might
reduce
american
happiness
without
necessarily
doing
much
damage
to
contentment
about
the
political
system
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
