new
york's
measles
outbreak
puts
vaccination
rules
on
the
spot
many
states
have
a
misinformed-parent
exemption
signs
warning
people
to
stay
away
if
they
have
fever
and
rash
are
posted
at
medical
practices
and
pharmacies
in
parts
of
brooklyn
a
borough
of
new
york
city
where
health
authorities
have
struggled
to
stop
a
measles
outbreak
that
began
in
october
more
than
people
have
contracted
the
disease
so
far
and
new
cases
show
no
sign
of
abating
with
outbreaks
going
on
in
several
other
states
measles
cases
in
america
this
year
are
on
track
to
reach
the
highest
number
since
most
cases
in
brooklyn
have
been
in
an
ultra-orthodox
jewish
enclave
where
many
parents
have
refused
to
vaccinate
their
children
pockets
with
vaccination
rates
lower
than
the
level
that
stops
measles
from
spreading
exist
across
america
but
brooklyn
is
densely
populated
and
that
has
made
the
disease
easier
to
spread
on
a
sunday
afternoon
playgrounds
in
a
neighbourhood
that
has
been
the
centre
of
the
outbreak
are
so
packed
that
there
is
hardly
any
space
for
children
to
run
around
large
families
are
the
norm
among
ultra-orthodox
jews
and
their
social
life
is
largely
confined
within
their
community
the
outbreak
in
brooklyn
began
with
an
unvaccinated
child
who
contracted
measles
on
a
visit
to
israel
there
is
no
religious
reason
why
jews
should
not
get
the
measles
vaccine
says
david
niederman
a
rabbi
in
brooklyn
like
him
most
rabbis
in
the
area
support
vaccination
and
even
urge
people
to
get
the
jab
but
that
advice
stands
against
anti-vaccine
propaganda
from
parents
educating
and
advocating
for
child
health
peach
a
group
that
has
aimed
its
publications
at
jewish
families
it
blanketed
parts
of
brooklyn
with
a
brochure
claiming
that
vaccines
are
harmful
and
unnecessary
attaching
letters
by
rabbis
in
support
of
its
cause
peach
also
runs
a
call-line
with
recorded
lectures
one
is
by
andrew
wakefield
author
of
a
discredited
study
from
that
linked
vaccines
with
autism
on
april
th
new
york
city
declared
a
public
health
emergency
making
vaccination
against
measles
mandatory
in
the
parts
of
brooklyn
where
cases
have
been
concentrated
residents
were
given
hours
to
comply
or
pay
a
fine
the
authorities
are
also
cracking
down
on
child-care
centres
and
yeshivas
religious
schools
that
have
flouted
a
ban
on
attendance
by
unvaccinated
children
that
the
city
issued
in
december
nearly
cases
of
measles
were
traced
to
unvaccinated
children
in
one
such
school
that
defied
the
ban
on
april
th
the
health
department
shut
down
a
day-care
centre
for
children
for
non-compliance
the
outbreak
in
new
york
has
charged
an
ongoing
debate
in
america
whether
to
abolish
the
exemptions
to
vaccination
for
schoolchildren
new
york
and
other
states
currently
allow
unvaccinated
children
to
attend
school
if
their
parents
claim
that
they
object
to
vaccines
on
religious
grounds
a
further
states
have
broader
philosophical
exemptions
too
in
such
non-medical
exemptions
were
used
for
of
american
schoolchildren
double
the
rate
in
paul
offit
of
the
vaccine
education
centre
at
the
children's
hospital
of
philadelphia
says
that
the
religious
exemption
to
vaccines
is
in
fact
a
misinformed
parent
exemption
vaccines
were
invented
long
after
the
main
religious
texts
had
been
written
and
no
widespread
religious
doctrine
says
people
cannot
be
vaccinated
says
dr
offit
proposals
to
abolish
non-medical
exemptions
have
been
introduced
in
several
state
legislatures
this
lawmaking
season
but
such
bills
as
well
as
some
that
would
make
it
easier
to
avoid
vaccines
are
a
perennial
feature
in
many
states
some
never
get
to
a
vote
by
and
large
the
trend
in
recent
years
has
been
to
make
non-medical
exemptions
harder
to
obtain
by
asking
parents
for
more
paperwork
or
to
renew
the
request
every
year
for
example
california
bucked
the
trend
and
abolished
non-medical
exemptions
in
in
response
to
a
big
measles
outbreak
vaccination
rates
went
up
but
so
did
the
rate
of
medical
exemptions
it
turned
out
that
some
doctors
were
writing
bogus
ones
and
parents
would
go
to
great
lengths
to
find
them
one
child
who
came
down
with
measles
had
received
an
exemption
from
all
vaccines
from
a
doctor's
practice
in
a
town
several
hundred
miles
away
there
is
more
that
can
be
done
most
parents
who
worry
about
the
safety
or
efficacy
of
vaccines
are
convincible
and
will
choose
to
vaccinate
their
children
if
doctors
answer
their
questions
with
patience
and
compassion
says
dr
offit
a
small
minority
of
parents
however
will
remain
strong
believers
in
conspiracy
theories
about
vaccines
no
matter
what
the
imprint
of
peach
in
brooklyn
suggests
that
paranoia
and
superstition
can
still
cast
a
spell
over
science
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
