why
elizabeth
warren
remains
vague
on
health
care
the
senator
from
massachusetts
usually
big
on
detail
does
not
have
a
plan
of
her
own
speaking
to
a
crowd
of
from
beneath
the
arch
of
washington
square
park
in
new
york
on
september
th
elizabeth
warren
received
the
loudest
cheers
when
she
declared
i
know
what's
broken
and
i've
got
a
plan
to
fix
it
in
a
democratic
presidential
primary
contest
in
which
there
has
been
little
movement
in
the
candidates
positions
in
the
polls
ms
warren
a
senator
from
massachusetts
has
engineered
an
exceptional
rise
thanks
in
part
to
her
plans
both
wonkish
and
attention-grabbing
for
universal
child
care
a
wealth
tax
a
trn
climate-change
plan
and
the
break-up
of
america's
biggest
technology
firms
but
on
health
care
which
may
be
the
biggest
issue
of
the
election
ms
warren
does
not
have
a
plan
of
her
own
nor
it
seems
does
she
intend
to
release
one
throughout
the
primary
ms
warren
has
signalled
unwavering
fealty
to
the
medicare
for
all
proposal
advanced
by
senator
bernie
sanders
a
fellow
progressive
but
she
was
once
more
open
to
other
positions
though
all
the
democratic
party's
primary
candidates
agree
on
the
need
for
universal
coverage
m
americans
or
of
the
population
still
lack
health
insurance
they
disagree
on
the
best
way
to
achieve
it
medicare
for
all
which
has
become
the
default
progressive
plan
envisages
a
single-payer
system
free
at
the
point
of
service
abolishing
private
health-insurance
schemes
altogether
the
moderates
who
dislike
mr
sanders's
ideas
like
joe
biden
pete
buttigieg
and
amy
klobuchar
propose
improvements
to
private
health-insurance
exchanges
created
by
obamacare
and
the
creation
of
a
public
option
for
those
who
want
it
ms
warren
previously
seemed
persuaded
by
such
a
policy
her
consumer
health
insurance
protection
act
reintroduced
in
april
of
this
year
sensibly
focuses
on
shoring
up
exchanges
ending
surprise
billing
and
closing
some
loopholes
for
sub-standard
health
insurance
at
a
town-hall
meeting
broadcast
on
cnn
in
march
she
sounded
open
to
different
pathways
to
medicare
for
all
she
has
remained
vague
on
the
subject
though
she
is
famous
for
her
attention
to
detail
she
often
talks
about
health
care
in
no
more
than
generalities
on
september
th
mr
buttigieg
took
a
swipe
at
her
for
being
extremely
evasive
when
she
was
asked
whether
medicare
for
all
would
increase
middle-class
taxes
ms
warren
seems
reluctant
to
talk
about
details
like
costs
and
implementation
timelines
perhaps
because
remaking
the
enormous
american
health-care
sector
in
the
image
of
britain's
national
health
service
could
realistically
take
a
decade
this
uncertain
positioning
is
not
unique
to
ms
warren
kamala
harris
has
performed
a
tortured
dance
of
support
for
the
medicare
for
all
plan
flip-flopping
several
times
on
whether
or
not
she
would
ban
private
insurance
as
the
plan
dictates
yet
even
ms
harris
who
has
been
much
woollier
on
policy
than
ms
warren
has
released
her
own
version
of
medicare
for
all
other
candidates
who
are
further
down
in
the
polls
like
cory
booker
a
new
jersey
senator
and
andrew
yang
a
businessman
have
embraced
mr
sanders's
plan
without
offering
their
own
the
drawback
of
ms
warren's
vague
approach
is
that
mr
sanders's
specific
vision
for
achieving
universal
coverage
goes
unchallenged
both
germany
and
australia
have
done
what
he
proposes
through
a
mix
of
public
and
private
options
a
model
that
may
be
more
easily
accomplished
in
america
than
a
single-payer
option
at
the
same
time
medicare
in
its
current
form
also
has
some
disagreeable
attributes
it
is
far
from
free
at
the
point
of
service
it
pays
for
many
expensive
drugs
without
conducting
cost-benefit
analyses
and
it
involves
some
onerous
billing
paperwork
preliminary
costings
of
a
sanders-style
plan
suggest
new
government
expenditures
of
trn
or
more
over
the
course
of
a
decade
that
is
times
the
optimistically
estimated
revenue
brought
in
by
ms
warren's
wealth-tax
idea
suggesting
that
most
of
the
balance
would
have
to
be
raised
from
less
wealthy
americans
her
general
retort
to
this
sort
of
point
that
aggregate
health
costs
would
still
drop
for
middle-class
families
is
both
fair
and
deserving
of
more
detail
yet
vagueness
could
be
politically
advantageous
for
ms
warren
her
steadfast
support
for
medicare
for
all
allows
her
to
attract
progressive
voters
within
the
democratic
electorate
especially
the
college-educated
whites
who
have
fuelled
her
rise
in
the
polls
criticism
of
the
plan
from
moderates
has
been
directed
at
mr
sanders
that
dynamic
was
on
vivid
display
in
the
last
presidential
debate
held
in
houston
on
september
th
yet
if
the
primaries
deliver
ms
warren
the
presidential
nomination
she
will
need
to
be
prepared
for
voters
to
give
her
health-care
plans
a
more
thorough
examination
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
