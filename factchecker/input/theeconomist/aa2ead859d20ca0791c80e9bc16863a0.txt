america's
government
shutdown
took
a
toll
some
republicans
would
prefer
a
national
emergency
to
a
repeat
performance
terrible
traffic
packed
metro
cars
full
restaurants
washington
returned
to
work
this
week
after
the
longest-ever
government
shutdown
ended
at
least
for
now
despite
vowing
not
to
reopen
government
without
the
bn
he
demanded
for
his
border
wall
donald
trump
did
just
that
signing
a
spending
bill
that
funds
the
government
through
february
th
and
creates
a
bipartisan
bicameral
commission
to
develop
a
border-security
proposal
ann
coulter
a
far-right
commentator
and
supporter
of
mr
trump
called
him
the
biggest
wimp
ever
to
serve
as
president
of
the
united
states
a
headline
on
the
daily
caller
a
conservative
website
blared
trump
caves
polls
showed
that
more
americans
blamed
mr
trump
for
the
shutdown
than
blamed
house
democrats
perhaps
because
days
before
it
began
he
boasted
that
he
would
be
proud
to
shut
down
the
government
if
congress
failed
to
give
him
exactly
what
he
wanted
when
it
was
over
the
non-partisan
congressional
budget
office
cbo
released
a
report
on
the
shutdown's
economic
effects
it
estimated
that
american
gdp
was
bn
lower
in
the
last
quarter
of
and
will
be
bn
lower
in
the
first
quarter
of
than
it
would
have
been
without
the
shutdown
that
pain
was
not
evenly
distributed
federal
workers
and
businesses
that
rely
on
them
felt
the
effects
more
strongly
than
the
economy
as
a
whole
though
much
of
that
activity
should
eventually
be
recovered
the
cbo
forecast
that
around
bn
or
of
projected
annual
gdp
has
been
permanently
lost
businesses
that
could
not
receive
permits
or
loans
because
the
relevant
agency
was
closed
probably
delayed
hiring
and
investment
unpaid
workers
who
had
to
take
out
loans
will
see
their
future
spending
constrained
by
debt
servicing
a
lack
of
published
economic
data
increased
economic
uncertainty
while
funding
gaps
probably
began
to
reduce
the
credibility
of
the
federal
government
making
it
harder
to
attract
talent
and
more
expensive
to
make
contracts
with
private
business
and
though
the
furloughed
or
unpaid
federal
workers
will
receive
back
wages
private-sector
workers
that
depend
on
government
suppliers
contractors
restaurants
near
government
offices
and
the
like
may
not
nor
is
america
out
of
the
woods
mr
trump
threatened
to
force
another
shutdown
if
the
commission
fails
to
come
up
with
a
recommendation
that
he
likes
bills
to
prevent
the
effects
of
a
shutdown
through
automatic
continuing
resolutions
meaning
that
funding
will
continue
at
current
levels
if
lawmakers
fail
to
agree
on
spending
levels
have
been
floated
in
both
houses
of
congress
by
members
of
both
parties
mr
trump
also
threatened
to
declare
a
national
emergency
a
prospect
some
congressional
republicans
find
more
appealing
than
another
shutdown
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
