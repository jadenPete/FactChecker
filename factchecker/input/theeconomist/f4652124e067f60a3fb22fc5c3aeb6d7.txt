donald
trump
made
a
dreadful
miscalculation
over
the
shutdown
he
will
suffer
less
for
it
than
the
democrats
think
when
donald
trump
shut
down
the
government
just
before
christmas
his
opponents
privately
shuddered
illegal
immigration
the
issue
he
had
chosen
to
stand
on
was
his
most
powerful
weapon
and
though
bloodied
in
the
mid-terms
he
retained
some
of
the
imposing
aura
that
his
stunning
election
loyal
base
and
two
years
without
serious
political
opposition
conferred
yet
five
weeks
later
with
daily
reports
of
coast
guards
visiting
food
banks
irs
desertions
and
fbi
indictments
postponed
for
want
of
cash
democratic
opinion
has
been
dramatically
revised
mr
trump's
opponents
think
they
have
got
him
at
last
a
democratic
congressman
told
lexington
it
was
unimaginable
that
mr
trump
will
be
re-elected
next
year
a
more
dispassionate
reading
of
the
shutdown's
political
fallout
as
senate
negotiations
point
to
a
possible
end
suggests
that
mr
trump
may
suffer
no
worse
than
a
bruising
stalemate
that
is
not
to
underrate
how
badly
he
has
handled
the
episode
indeed
it
has
been
a
case-study
in
presidential
incompetence
the
sketchiest
knowledge
of
recent
shutdowns
could
have
told
mr
trump
that
whoever
instigates
one
rarely
gets
what
he
wants
voters
are
liable
to
blame
him
at
which
point
his
imagined
leverage
becomes
a
handicap
and
this
was
especially
likely
to
happen
to
mr
trump
given
that
most
americans
don't
want
his
promised
border-wall
and
don't
need
convincing
that
the
democrats
the
party
of
government
are
not
keen
to
deprive
government
workers
of
pay
especially
so
moreover
given
that
mr
trump
boasted
that
he
would
happily
take
the
mantle
of
responsibility
for
the
shutdown
before
it
began
even
in
the
rundown
factory-towns
of
trump
country
voters
have
been
quoting
his
words
back
to
reporters
ever
since
the
shutdown
was
plainly
a
terrible
idea
mr
trump
launched
it
in
response
to
goading
from
immigration
hawks
and
with
the
prospect
of
a
new
democratic
house
looming
at
what
he
thought
was
his
last
moment
of
unrivalled
power
yet
the
incoming
democrats
house
majority
had
already
reduced
his
bargaining
room
including
any
chance
of
the
deal
that
he
turned
down
last
year
billions
for
the
wall
in
return
for
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
the
illegal
immigrants
known
as
dreamers
even
if
those
or
similar
terms
were
on
offer
moreover
mr
trump
seems
too
cowed
by
his
right-wing
critics
to
accept
them
this
leaves
a
more
modest
fix
as
a
likelier
conclusion
to
the
stand-off
the
democrats
offer
a
bit
more
money
for
border-security
provided
mr
trump
reopens
the
government
first
that
is
embarrassing
for
mr
trump
even
so
he
has
suffered
less
damage
than
his
opponents
think
his
ratings
though
down
a
few
points
are
well
within
the
remarkably
stable
range
they
have
maintained
ever
since
his
inauguration
with
around
of
voters
approving
of
his
performance
he
is
more
popular
than
he
was
in
december
when
he
signed
off
on
the
tax
cut
that
is
his
administration's
single
main
legislative
achievement
the
history
of
shutdown
polling
also
suggests
the
knock
to
his
ratings
will
be
short-lived
no
party
blamed
for
a
shutdown
has
paid
a
heavy
electoral
price
for
it
political
loyalties
are
too
baked
in
the
federal
government
too
remote
from
most
people's
lives
after
shutting
down
the
government
for
days
in
republicans
swept
the
mid-terms
the
next
year
moreover
the
nature
of
mr
trump's
appeal
on
immigration
issues
which
is
based
more
on
a
sense
of
shared
cultural
anxiety
with
his
voters
than
the
promise
of
a
concrete
wall
makes
them
even
less
likely
to
desert
him
as
things
stand
the
trump
shutdown
already
the
longest
and
costliest
of
recent
times
is
more
likely
to
entrench
america's
political
division
than
alter
it
that
might
end
up
as
a
win
for
the
democrats
mr
trump's
base
as
the
mid-terms
indicated
is
too
small
to
keep
him
in
power
and
yet
the
nativist
politics
he
feeds
it
with
including
the
wall
are
off-putting
to
the
more
discerning
conservatives
he
needs
elected
by
a
minority
of
americans
and
ever
fearful
of
the
handful
of
hard-right
pundits
who
seem
to
speak
for
them
mr
trump
has
in
reality
always
been
a
weak
president
yet
instead
of
celebrating
prematurely
democrats
need
to
reflect
more
carefully
on
why
the
man
who
bested
them
in
might
be
pursuing
such
an
apparently
self-defeating
strategy
compulsion
to
be
sure
is
part
of
the
answer
mr
trump
is
facing
a
storm
of
investigations
as
special
counsel
robert
mueller
approaches
his
end-game
and
house
democrats
let
fly
their
subpoenas
in
response
he
needs
his
conservative
cheerleaders
to
be
not
sulkily
willing
to
roll
out
the
vote
for
him
next
year
but
boiling
over
with
protective
fury
yet
mr
trump's
willingness
to
forsake
moderation
is
also
fuelled
by
his
confidence
that
the
democrats
recoiling
against
him
to
the
hard-left
will
do
likewise
and
that
mr
trump
trusts
will
persuade
voters
who
don't
much
care
for
him
to
vote
for
him
anyway
this
is
how
the
trump
team
believes
he
won
in
it
considers
hillary
clinton's
contemptuous
reference
to
trump
voters
as
deplorables
more
helpful
than
anything
the
russians
did
it
is
an
over-simplification
at
best
but
one
democrats
should
be
more
mindful
of
than
they
are
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
sanctimonious
reference
to
mr
trump's
border-wall
as
an
immorality
sounded
too
much
like
mrs
clinton
and
meanwhile
the
left-wing
positions
adopted
by
most
early
runners
for
the
democratic
presidential
ticket
including
free
college
and
medicare
for
all
offers
additional
encouragement
for
mr
trump's
calculation
as
the
ultimate
manifestation
of
america's
political
dysfunction
shutdowns
represent
a
lack
of
mutual
comprehension
as
well
as
goals
the
democrats
are
right
to
marvel
at
how
the
current
one
reveals
mr
trump's
ignorance
of
their
new
strength
but
they
should
be
careful
mutual
incomprehension
cuts
both
ways
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
