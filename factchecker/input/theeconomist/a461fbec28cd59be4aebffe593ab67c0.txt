imagine
there's
no
politics
it's
easy
if
you
try
but
it's
not
a
good
way
for
democrats
to
devise
badly
needed
climate
policy
now
into
its
th
season
the
self-parody
act
that
is
the
republican
party
on
global
warming
is
still
playing
to
a
loyal
audience
with
the
nomination
of
kelly
knight
craft
to
be
ambassador
to
the
un
americans
can
expect
to
be
represented
in
the
world's
premier
climate-policy
forum
by
the
wife
of
a
billionaire
coal
magnate
and
trump
donor
who
claims
to
admire
both
sides
of
the
science
on
global
warming
reports
meanwhile
emerged
of
a
white
house
scheme
to
commission
a
panel
of
sceptics
to
attack
the
government's
own
national
climate
assessment
the
latest
iteration
of
this
quadrennial
review
of
america's
changing
climate
launched
in
by
george
h.w.
bush
the
last
republican
leader
to
play
it
straight
on
global
warming
irked
donald
trump
released
in
november
while
california
was
battling
its
worst
wildfire
of
modern
times
it
did
not
support
the
president's
claim
that
insufficient
raking
of
the
forest
floor
was
to
blame
no
wonder
many
democrats
want
to
cut
the
republicans
out
of
climate
policymaking
altogether
their
two
past
attempts
to
curb
greenhouse-gas
emissions
a
legislative
effort
in
and
the
regulatory
steps
taken
by
barack
obama
both
foundered
on
republican
resistance
the
first
the
waxman-markey
cap-and-trade
bill
passed
the
house
but
was
not
taken
up
in
the
senate
after
the
democrats
lost
their
vote
majority
there
the
second
is
being
dismantled
by
the
fossil-fuel
lobbyists
mr
trump
hired
to
run
the
environmental
protection
agency
the
democrats
nascent
third
effort
the
green
new
deal
gnd
championed
by
representative
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
endorsed
by
kamala
harris
and
other
presidential
hopefuls
is
therefore
designed
differently
it
is
intended
to
have
the
durability
of
legislation
but
to
be
so
broadly
appealing
to
democrats
it
can
be
passed
without
republican
support
thus
its
main
innovation
targeting
climate
change
and
social
inequities
together
a
blueprint
released
by
ms
ocasio-cortez
and
senator
ed
markey
one
of
the
architects
of
the
bill
promises
universal
health
care
and
affordable
housing
as
well
as
extremely
steep
emissions
cuts
this
has
been
viewed
as
a
naive
effort
to
cure
all
the
ills
of
modern
capitalism
at
a
stroke
yet
it
is
also
intended
in
theory
more
pragmatically
to
expand
democratic
support
for
emissions
cuts
by
harnessing
the
two
main
parts
of
the
party's
coalition
college
graduates
who
want
climate-change
policy
and
blue-collar
workers
whose
jobs
are
threatened
by
it
resistance
from
those
workers
representatives
for
example
joe
manchin
of
west
virginia
the
ranking
democrat
on
the
senate
energy
committee
was
another
reason
why
waxman-markey
failed
the
social
policy
in
the
gnd
blueprint
is
designed
to
win
them
over
the
enthusiasm
the
green
deal
has
generated
from
the
climate
activists
who
invaded
mitch
mcconnell's
senate
office
this
week
as
well
as
the
contenders
is
testament
to
more
than
ms
ocasio-cortez's
salesmanship
its
emissions
targets
which
would
include
decarbonising
electricity
generation
within
a
decade
are
at
once
vastly
ambitious
and
merely
commensurate
with
what
scientists
recommend
that
makes
it
hard
for
anyone
concerned
about
global
warming
to
gainsay
the
proposal
it
has
a
powerful
moral
allure
yet
the
gravity
of
climate
change
also
means
the
world
cannot
afford
another
failed
effort
by
america
to
curb
its
tide
of
carbon
pollution
and
the
green
deal
appears
to
have
no
chance
of
success
only
a
unified
democratic
government
with
a
filibuster-proof
majority
or
no
filibuster
to
worry
about
could
entertain
passing
it
this
is
not
simply
because
the
climate-related
proposals
in
ms
ocasio-cortez's
draft
are
left-wing
in
fact
by
allowing
a
possible
role
for
carbon
pricing
nuclear
power
and
carbon
capture-and-storage
they
are
more
moderate
than
many
activists
would
like
a
bigger
problem
is
that
by
lumping
together
climate
and
social
policy
the
proposal
appears
to
confirm
one
of
the
main
republican
arguments
for
inaction
on
global
warming
a
contention
that
democrats
are
using
the
issue
as
a
smokescreen
for
a
left-wing
economic
agenda
this
has
hitherto
been
an
exaggeration
democrats
have
been
pushing
carbon
pricing
a
market-based
solution
for
a
decade
yet
the
green
deal
provides
compelling
evidence
for
it
which
makes
the
prospects
of
republicans
returning
to
sanity
on
global
warming
even
more
remote
it
might
therefore
seem
sensible
that
the
deal's
architects
are
only
counting
on
democratic
votes
yet
moderates
such
as
mr
manchin
who
says
the
gnd
is
not
a
deal
it's
a
dream
seem
unlikely
to
support
it
the
proposal
is
already
being
used
to
attack
such
democrats
in
rural
states
with
lots
of
extractive
industries
opposing
it
would
offer
them
a
relatively
low-cost
opportunity
to
define
themselves
against
their
party
it
is
therefore
hard
to
imagine
anything
resembling
ms
ocasio-cortez's
blueprint
passing
into
law
and
if
it
did
republicans
would
unite
to
overturn
it
just
as
they
did
in
response
to
mr
obama's
much
less
provocative
health-care
reform
the
inconvenient
truth
for
democrats
is
that
they
cannot
impose
their
policies
by
legislative
fiat
any
more
than
mr
obama
could
do
so
by
executive
order
it
is
a
tough
conclusion
because
the
prospects
for
bipartisan
climate
action
are
modest
at
best
and
it
would
be
hard
to
maintain
enthusiasm
on
the
left
for
the
incremental
steps
such
as
limited
carbon
pricing
such
action
might
entail
while
privately
conceding
the
unreality
of
the
green
deal
some
democratic
lawmakers
therefore
view
it
as
a
powerful
slogan
to
be
replaced
by
more
achievable
policy
in
due
course
that
could
make
tactical
sense
if
it
helps
ensure
the
next
democratic
president
prioritises
the
issue
but
it
risks
underestimating
how
hard
it
will
be
to
pass
any
serious
climate
policy
opposition
politicians
who
duck
the
painstaking
work
of
developing
credible
policy
are
liable
to
come
to
power
with
no
serious
plan
as
the
republicans
demonstrated
in
their
opposition
to
obamacare
it
is
an
example
ms
ocasio-cortez
and
her
supporters
are
closer
to
emulating
than
they
think
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
