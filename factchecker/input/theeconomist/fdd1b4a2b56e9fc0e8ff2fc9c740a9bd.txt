floods
and
storms
are
altering
american
attitudes
to
climate
change
the
midwest
is
soaked
and
less
sceptical
four
generations
of
one
family
run
riverdock
restaurant
in
hardin
a
small
town
on
a
spit
of
wooded
land
between
the
swollen
illinois
and
mississippi
rivers
the
matriarch
is
sara
heffington
in
red
t-shirt
and
jeans
she
says
the
illinois
river
usually
passes
feet
metres
from
the
long
ground-floor
room
where
they
serve
biscuits
and
sausage
gravy
today
water
laps
at
the
front
door
she
recalls
a
previous
deluge
as
they
prepared
to
open
in
back
then
a
levee
broke
and
neck-high
muddy
water
submerged
them
that
was
a
one-in-
year
flood
she
says
in
years
when
lots
of
snow
melts
upstream
or
increasingly
stormy
spring
rain
overfills
midwestern
rivers
the
heffingtons
get
gravel
from
a
nearby
quarry
fill
bags
and
build
a
defensive
wall
at
the
moment
an
oozing
white
barrier
again
surrounds
their
restaurant
as
diesel-pumps
spit
defiant
jets
back
towards
the
river
they
just
about
keep
nature
at
bay
even
as
a
fast-moving
torrent
almost
wets
the
roadway
on
hardin's
green
metal
bridge
when
that
closed
years
ago
the
town
was
all
but
cut
off
for
five
months
the
illinois
is
likely
to
crest
again
next
week
at
almost
the
same
high
level
it's
starting
to
scare
us
admits
mrs
heffington
asked
why
a
one-in-
year
flood
is
back
so
soon
she
first
blames
a
recent
lack
of
dredging
and
then
talks
of
extraordinary
rains
up
north
she
sees
a
long-term
cycle
as
the
climate
changes
but
the
lord
has
a
plan
and
she
doubts
people
affect
the
weather
much
the
youngest
waitress
skylar
giberson
disagrees
with
her
older
relative
denial
won't
do
she
says
humans
and
carbon
emissions
are
changing
the
climate
permanently
her
plan
we
should
just
move
ms
giberson
just
out
of
high
school
may
be
proved
right
america
has
just
notched
up
its
wettest
months
ever
and
floods
are
worsening
across
the
midwest
in
the
past
century
annual
precipitation
has
risen
by
across
the
region
a
faster
increase
than
for
america
as
a
whole
the
great
lakes
region
heated
up
by
an
average
of
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
in
the
years
to
concluded
scientists
from
the
region
in
a
report
in
march
that
was
also
faster
than
the
national
trend
because
warmer
air
holds
more
moisture
and
can
suddenly
release
it
precipitation
will
keep
rising
a
increase
in
the
region
is
possible
this
century
if
global
carbon
emissions
go
unchecked
according
to
the
federal
agencies
who
produced
the
national
climate
assessment
nca
late
last
year
this
warned
that
more
winter
and
spring
downpours
will
mean
more
sodden
soil
leaching
of
nutrients
and
delays
to
farmers
planting
season
robert
criss
a
hydrogeologist
at
washington
university
in
st
louis
says
rain
bursts
are
most
destructive
and
can
go
crazy
in
smaller
river
basins
but
even
huge
rivers
like
the
mississippi
can
struggle
with
higher
overall
flows
decades
of
building
levees
close
to
rivers
has
narrowed
them
blocked
flood
plains
and
lifted
water
no
year
has
yet
surpassed
a
huge
flood
in
but
he
says
the
mississippi
in
st
louis
has
reached
historically
high
water
marks
in
four
of
the
past
seven
years
rivers
are
being
constrained
like
never
before
he
says
the
missouri
river
for
example
is
on
average
half
the
width
of
its
former
natural
state
narrowed
channels
plus
rising
rainfall
make
sudden
collapses
of
levees
more
likely
such
as
the
one
that
wrecked
the
riverdock
restaurant
in
or
another
that
struck
part
of
davenport
an
iowan
city
on
the
mississippi
early
in
may
this
year
sudden
floods
can
tear
asphalt
off
roads
strip
top
soil
away
smash
grain
silos
making
them
more
destructive
than
gradual
ones
as
waters
rise
politicians
across
the
midwest
are
starting
to
speak
more
about
climate
change
in
part
that
is
because
several
democrats
took
over
governors
mansions
after
elections
last
year
by
late
april
governors
including
those
of
industry-heavy
places
like
illinois
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
had
joined
an
alliance
of
states
formed
in
to
combat
climate
change
members
vow
to
meet
emissions
targets
set
in
the
paris
climate
accord
defying
president
donald
trump's
promise
to
pull
america
out
of
it
tony
evers
wisconsin's
democratic
governor
for
example
says
he
has
brought
science
back
to
his
state
after
eight
years
of
climate-change
deniers
under
his
republican
predecessor
scott
walker
he
did
so
because
he
worries
about
the
amount
of
water
that's
been
dumped
on
the
state
as
the
crazy
weather
happenings
continue
we're
having
hundred-year
floods
every
couple
of
years
he
has
also
beefed
up
the
state's
once-neglected
environmental
agency
illinois
democratic
governor
j.b.
pritzker
declared
in
january
that
climate
change
is
real
and
that
the
state's
emissions
would
fall
by
at
least
compared
with
by
democrats
are
also
responding
to
voters
who
tell
pollsters
they
care
more
about
the
subject
than
ever
several
aspiring
presidential
candidates
support
some
form
of
a
green
new
deal
jay
inslee
washington's
governor
is
basing
his
presidential
run
on
the
issue
pete
buttigieg
from
indiana
says
climate
change
is
happening
in
the
midwest
now
it
is
not
theoretical
he
says
even
catholic
conservatives
in
indiana
warmed
to
the
topic
after
a
papal
encyclical
on
the
environment
in
mr
trump
remains
as
hostile
as
ever
the
new
york
times
reports
that
his
administration
has
told
scientists
not
to
include
worst-case
scenarios
of
climate
change
in
the
next
nca
due
before
some
were
told
not
to
make
any
forecasts
for
changes
beyond
when
the
biggest
disruption
is
likeliest
yet
ever
more
voters
can
see
what
is
happening
first-hand
older
polling
by
pew
had
suggested
that
coast-dwellers
were
more
alarmed
by
climate
change
than
those
living
miles
or
more
inland
but
inlanders
views
seem
to
be
shifting
too
a
survey
published
this
year
by
the
energy
policy
institute
part
of
the
university
of
chicago
found
that
of
americans
believe
climate
change
is
real
nearly
half
are
also
more
persuaded
by
warnings
from
climate
scientists
than
they
were
five
years
earlier
many
said
that
witnessing
extreme
weather
events
like
the
tornadoes
storms
and
floods
battering
the
midwest
did
most
to
form
their
views
michael
greenstone
who
runs
the
institute
says
the
midwest
is
already
affected
by
hotter
summers
and
it
is
more
challenging
for
agriculture
the
region's
farmers
are
already
at
the
sharp
end
of
change
mr
greenstone's
current
research
not
yet
published
points
to
spikes
in
summer
temperature
that
could
threaten
the
viability
of
the
region's
two
staple
crops
corn
and
soyabeans
possibly
even
before
mid-century
unless
geneticists
can
develop
heat-resistant
strains
planting
will
march
steadily
northwards
other
researchers
at
indiana
university
warned
late
last
year
that
more
frequent
summer
droughts
plus
the
spread
of
pests
in
warmer
winters
also
threaten
agricultural
productivity
across
the
midwest
one
summer

the
region
an
estimated
bn
down
by
the
river
there
are
some
compensations
at
riverdock
mrs
heffington
says
a
few
tourists
who
come
to
gawp
at
the
floods
stop
for
a
meal
downriver
at
alton
high-flood
marks
adorn
white
grain
silos
opposite
the
tourist
centre
molly
price
who
runs
it
says
the
floods
at
least
provide
a
lively
topic
of
conversation
and
then
everyone
talks
about
climate
change
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the

court's
