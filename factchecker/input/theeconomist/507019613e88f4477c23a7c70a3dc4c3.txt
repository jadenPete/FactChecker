was
jeffrey
epstein's
plea
deal
fishy
it
was
soft
enough
to
jeopardise
the
job
of
a
current
trump
cabinet
member
editor's
note
alexander
acosta
announced
his
resignation
on
july
th
the
indictment
of
jeffrey
epstein
on
charges
of
sex-trafficking
described
a
pyramid
scheme
for
the
sexual
abuse
of
minors
mr
epstein
would
pay
hundreds
of
dollars
apiece
for
sexual
encounters
with
adolescent
girls
at
his
mansion
in
manhattan's
upper
east
side
and
then
pay
them
to
recruit
other
underage
girls
when
police
searched
the
residence
they
uncovered
hundreds
of
pictures
of
nude
young-looking
women
some
on
cds
kept
in
a
locked
safe
with
names
like
misc
nudes
and
girl
pics
nude
three
personal
employees
apparently
aided
in
the
scheme
this
is
all
revolting
but
it
is
hardly
a
great
surprise
more
than
a
decade
ago
police
and
prosecutors
stumbled
across
a
similar
pattern
of
conduct
in
palm
beach
florida
where
mr
epstein
owns
another
mansion
in
a
later
civil
case
the
victims
alleged
that
hundreds
of
young
girls
had
been
abused
yet
mr
epstein
got
off
remarkably
lightly
his
plea
deal
which
was
not
first
shown
to
the
victims
as
required
by
federal
law
included
charges
of
soliciting
prostitution
from
a
girl
as
young
as
and
thus
well
below
the
state
age
of
consent
he
received
a
sentence
of
months
of
which
he
served
months
in
the
private
wing
of
a
county
jail
mr
epstein
was
released
for
six
days
out
of
the
week
to
go
to
work
harsher
sentences
are
doled
out
for
forging
a
check
the
case
has
thus
come
to
symbolise
something
larger
about
unequal
justice
for
those
with
the
right
connections
or
who
can
afford
an
all-star
defence
team
mr
epstein
is
routinely
described
as
a
billionaire
forbes
which
chronicles
america's
nine-zeroed
class
says
he
is
not
and
points
out
that
his
money-management
firm
registered
in
the
virgin
islands
produced
no
public
records
and
no
list
of
clients
the
magazine
has
never
included
him
in
its
list
of
the
richest
americans
what
is
true
is
that
mr
epstein
had
money
for
private
jets
a
private
island
and
a
handful
of
houses
he
was
also
on
first-name
terms
with
two
presidents
bill
clinton
jeffrey
is
both
a
highly
successful
financier
and
a
committed
philanthropist
he
once
said
and
donald
trump
i've
known
jeff
for
years
terrific
guy
he's
a
lot
of
fun
to
be
with
it
is
even
said
that
he
likes
beautiful
women
as
much
as
i
do
and
many
of
them
are
on
the
younger
side
mr
trump
told
a
magazine
almost
two
decades
ago
since
he
was
charged
in
both
men
have
distanced
themselves
from
mr
epstein
wealth
child
abuse
and
presidents
are
powerful
ingredients
for
conspiracy
theories
the
truth
may
be
more
prosaic
mr
epstein's
original
defence
team
included
alan
dershowitz
and
kenn
starr
two
lawyers
skilled
in
defending
the
indefensible
the
evidence
in
the
original
case
appears
overwhelming
in
an
interview
with
the
miami
herald
the
lead
detective
recounted
phone
records
flight
logs
and
instructions
for
delivering
flowers
to
one
of
mr
epstein's
young
fixations
alongside
her
high-school
report
card
but
the
difficulties
of
securing
convictions
in
cases
of
rape
or
sexual
abuse
are
well
known
nor
is
it
obvious
that
the
top
federal
prosecutor
who
negotiated
the
deal
alexander
acosta
had
better
options
available
that
may
not
save
him
mr
acosta
is
currently
serving
as
mr
trump's
labour
secretary
democrats
would
now
like
him
ousted
nancy
pelosi
the
democratic
speaker
of
the
house
and
chuck
schumer
the
senate's
minority
leader
have
called
for
his
resignation
so
too
have
many
of
those
vying
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
mr
trump
so
far
has
lent
his
support
saying
he
feels
very
badly
for
mr
acosta
and
noting
that
he's
been
a
great
really
great
secretary
of
labour
when
past
cabinet
secretaries
have
attracted
negative
headlines
mr
trump
has
often
started
out
strongly
supportive
and
then
soured
as
the
withering
critiques
continued
turbulence
in
the
trump
administration
is
no
new
phenomenon
much
of
it
results
from
a
lack
of
due
diligence
mr
acosta
was
not
properly
vetted
until
after
he
was
nominated
for
the
post
following
the
withdrawal
of
mr
trump's
previous
nominee
andrew
puzder
amid
allegations
of
domestic
abuse
and
failure
to
pay
taxes
among
the
portfolios
mr
acosta
now
oversees
are
enforcement
of
child-labour
and
human-trafficking
laws
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
