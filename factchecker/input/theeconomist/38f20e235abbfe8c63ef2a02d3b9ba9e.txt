the
surprising
revival
of
the
hawaiian
language
could
that
success
be
replicated
elsewhere
so
sing
the
children
at
hawaii's
punana
leo
o
hilo
kindergarten
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
it
is
raining
on
the
uplands
it
is
raining
by
the
sea
the
chant
is
much
like
any
other
rain
rain
go
away
nursery
rhyme
but
it
has
an
unusual
power
it
is
one
of
the
tools
that
has
brought
about
the
revival
of
a
near-dead
language
the
decline
of
hawaiian
was
not
as
is
the
case
with
most
disappearing
languages
a
natural
demise
caused
by
migration
and
mass
media
in
after
the
overthrow
of
the
hawaiian
monarchy
by
american
business
interests
schools
were
banned
from
using
the
language
and
children
were
beaten
for
speaking
it
by
the
late
th
century
aside
from
a
couple
of
hundred
people
on
one
tiny
island
english
had
replaced
hawaiian
and
only
the
old
spoke
the
language
to
each
other
the
civil-rights
movement
brought
a
revival
of
interest
among
the
young
centred
on
the
university
of
hawaii
at
hilo
larry
kimura
a
professor
there
was
not
satisfied
that
the
language
should
be
merely
a
subject
taught
at
college
he
and
his
students
wanted
to
bring
it
back
to
life
the
idea
for
how
to
do
that
came
from
a
visiting
maori
who
suggested
language
nests
which
had
been
successfully
used
to
revive
new
zealand's
native
language
in
when
educating
children
in
hawaiian
was
still
banned
kauanoe
kamana
and
her
husband
pila
wilson
both
students
of
kimura's
created
the
first
punana
leo
which
means
language
nest
at
hilo
neither
was
a
native
speaker
but
both
were
determined
to
bring
up
their
children
as
such
they
gathered
together
a
small
group
of
children
including
their
own
son
and
daughter
and
elderly
native
speakers
the
movement
grew
there
are
now
kindergartens
and
schools
some
of
them
stand-alone
hawaiian-medium
schools
some
hawaiian-medium
strands
within
english-medium
schools
the
number
of
children
being
educated
in
hawaiian
has
risen
from
in
to
in
along
with
japanese
hawaiian
is
the
non-english
language
most
commonly
spoken
among
children
the
success
has
been
hard-won
campaigners
had
to
get
the
law
changed
and
they
also
had
to
fight

people
in
the
community
even
in
our
families
were
saying
you'll
ruin
your
children's
future
they
won't
be
able
to
go
to
college
they'll
be
total
failures
such
fears
turned
out
to
be
unfounded

focus
says
mr
wilson
we
value
our
connection
with
our
ancestors
more
than
we
value
being
millionaires
he
says
mr
kimura
explains
that
the
schools
have
allowed
hawaiians
to
pass
on
their
culture
including
the
creation

by

stories
says
that
the
wobbly
moment
for
young
hawaiian-speakers
comes
at
the
beginning
of
high
school
at
the
age
of
we
tend
to
speak
english
a
lot
it's
kind
of
like
a
virus
but
hawaiian
has
a
different
sort
of
power
we
like
to
use
it
outside
school
just
to
communicate
in
a
secret
language
so
other
kids
want
to
learn
it
she
is
teaching
it
to
the
non-hawaiian-speakers
in
her
football
team
efforts
have
been
made
to
revive
other
american
languages
the
most
notable
has
been
the
rebirth
of
a
truly
dead
language
wopanaak
which
used
to
be
spoken
by
the
mashpee
wampanoag
tribe
of
massachusetts
but
died
out
in
the
th
century
fortunately
a
th-century
translation
of
the
bible
into
wopanaak
made
reclamation
possible
and
it
is
now
the
medium
of
instruction
in
a
kindergarten
modelled
on
punana
leo
but
none
has
got
as
far
as
hawaiian
if
you
look
around
the
world
it's
a
very
rare
success
says
andrew
cowell
of
the
university
of
colorado
he
attributes
that
to
the
advantage
of
exclusivity
it
is
the
only
native
american
language
in
hawaii
whereas
many
states
have
a
number
of
different
tribes
each
with
its
own
language
and

support
from
the
university
kalamanamana
harman
recalls
a
sense
of
isolation
when
she
was
brought
up
as
a
hawaiian-speaker
it's
hard
being
different
from
other
kids
she
says
but
you
see
the
value
of
it
over
time
she
intends
to
bring
up
her
children
as
hawaiian-speakers
recalling
her
kindergarten
days
she

of

points
out
that
