bet
on
o'rourke
the
texan
democrat
has
a
rare
ability
to
control
his
own
narrative
less
than
a
week
into
his
presidential
campaign
beto
o'rourke
is
stirring
strong
emotions
among
the
thousands
who
have
flocked
to
hear
the
skateboarding
bilingual
texan
in
the
small
rallies
he
has
already
held
in
iowa
michigan
ohio
pennsylvania
and
new
hampshire
they
seem
to
be
largely
positive
youngish
tall
and
more
charismatic
than
any
of
his
rivals
as
he
demonstrated
during
his
losing
senate
campaign
last
year
the
year-old
former
congressman
is
democratic
box
office
during
a
pit-stop
at
penn
state
university
in
central
pennsylvania
midway
between
iowa
and
new
hampshire
he
received
half
the
adulation
senator
bernie
sanders
would
have
got
with
a
tenth
of
the
planning
there
is
a
gushier
edge
to
betomania
too
like
swede
levov
george
clooney
and
yes
barack
obama
whose
pensive
pauses
fluid
perorations
and
optimism
mr
o'rourke
has
repurposed
for
a
dress-down
generation
he
has
passed
the
first
test
of
american
heroism
women
and
men
seem
equally
prone
to
admire
or
love
him
as
he
tried
to
exit
the
crush
of
a
couple
of
thousand
students
while
standing
head
and
shoulder
above
them
your
columnist
overheard
one
express
amorous
thoughts
for
him
while
another
loudly
invited
the
candidate
to
join
his
punk
band
yet
mr
o'rourke
whose
music
is
these
days
confined
to
air-drumming
behind
the
wheel
has
also
attracted
more
and
nastier
criticism
than
his
dozen
rivals
put
together
his
unofficial
campaign
announcement
a
cover-interview
in
vanity
fair
with
pictures
by
annie
leibovitz
was
panned
as
preening
and
entitled
commentators
on
the
right
have
piled
into
his
underwhelming
record
as
a
once-aimless
youth
with
a
drunk-driving
charge
who
married
money
then
served
three
low-key
terms
in
the
house
of
representatives
those
on
the
left
were
scandalised
when
mr
o'rourke
in
an
early
stump
speech
made
a
joke
of
his
absentee
fathering
and
there
is
a
bipartisan
consensus
that
mr
o'rourke
who
has
launched
himself
at
america
in
a
self-driven
rental
truck
with
tearaway
passion
no
campaign
manager
and
few
firm
policy
ideas
shows
an
unbefitting
want
of
seriousness
when
are
we
going
to
get
an
actual
policy
from
you
instead
of
platitudes
and
nice
stories
asked
a
sanders
supporter
in
the
crowd
at
penn
state
much
of
this
is
warranted
mr
o'rourke
is
an
undistinguished
democratic
front-runner
and
his
sketchiness
on
large
areas
of
policy
seems
almost
wilful
surely
on
the
journey
of
introspection
that
followed
his
texas
defeat
during
which
mr
o'rourke
ate
sacred
dirt
in
new
mexico
and
blogged
religiously
he
could
have
found
time
to
form
a
view
on
brexit
yet
he
says
he
has
no
opinion
on
it
and
he
has
little
more
to
say
on
the
environmental
and
other
economic
policies
he
claims
to
prioritise
having
sounded
unenthusiastic
about
the
green
new
deal
preached
by
left-wingers
he
was
asked
in
pennsylvania
how
he
would
change
it
his
reply
included
much
emphasis
on
the
seriousness
of
the
climate
emergency
as
if
his
audience
needed
convincing
on
that
a
joke
about
not
wanting
to
be
seen
as
one
of
the
pendejos
who
failed
to
deal
with
it
a
shout-out
to
texan
wind
turbines
and
little
else
yet
it
is
possible
to
exaggerate
mr
o'rourke's
cluelessness
he
has
conventional
progressive
positions
on
criminal
justice
and
immigration
reform
and
a
more
interesting
emerging
one
on
health
care
having
backed
medicare
for
all
he
now
wants
to
expand
it
while
protecting
the
private-insurance
market
as
most
of
his
rivals
rush
to
the
left
that
is
a
notable
statement
of
realism
it
is
also
moot
whether
mr
o'rourke's
hot
air
on
climate
change
is
less
serious
than
the
hallucination
masquerading
as
policy
that
is
the
green
new
deal
mr
o'rourke
has
been
so
condemned
mainly
because
his
diverse
critics
view
him
as
a
threat
for
professional
politickers
the
consultants
pollsters
and
columnists
who
shape
political
news
his
campaign
is
heretical
he
disdains
polling
depicts
his
rallies
as
brainstorming
sessions
and
generates
and
distributes
much
of
his
own
media
and
his
methods
work
his
slim
defeat
in
texas
was
not
the
stunning
achievement
he
claims
yet
it
gave
him
a
national
profile
and
sanders-esque
command
of
online
fundraising
his
methods
also
work
for
reasons
none
of
his
democratic
rivals
looks
able
to
replicate
in
place
of
policy
smarts
mr
o'rourke
projects
a
mood
that
many
find
appealing
his
optimistic
talk
of
america's
genius
is
familiar
yet
mingled
with
a
rarer
call
for
humility
and
atonement
though
america's
shortcomings
its
injustices
and
political
dysfunction
are
experienced
unevenly
fixing
them
starts
with
acknowledging
that
everyone
is
responsible
not
least
the
candidate
thank
you
for
the
accountability
he
replied
sadly
when
asked
to
explain
the
mismatch
between
his
idealistic
rhetoric
and
more
pragmatic
voting
record
it
was
almost
moving
mr
o'rourke
who
is
reading
joseph
campbell's
treatise
on
heroism
the
power
of
myth
is
not
only
the
master
of
his
narrative
because
of
his
quirkiness
it
is
also
because
his
frailties
are
as
integral
to
it
as
his
inspirational
strengths
he
comes
across
as
a
reformed
drifter
vying
to
turn
a
personal
quest
for
self-improvement
into
a
political
cause
if
he
fails
it
will
be
because
democrats
find
his
shortcomings
too
risky
mr
obama
one
notes
had
to
convince
them
he
had
serious
policy
chops
besides
the
feel-good
yet
democrats
face
bigger
challenges
today
than
they
did
back
then
to
which
mr
o'rourke
offers
a
possibly
flawed
yet
perhaps
unrivalled
answer
the
hard
left
is
stronger
which
makes
his
obama-like
ability
to
cloak
his
pragmatism
in
soaring
rhetoric
and
a
few
progressive
pledges
especially
valuable
and
donald
trump
who
tries
to
turn
any
contest
into
a
brawl
is
a
fierce
opponent
a
democratic
challenger
who
could
not
merely
dust
himself
off
as
mr
obama
could
but
make
his
patience
and
fortitude
seem
more
important
than
the
president's
boorishness
as
mr
o'rourke
would
try
to
do
might
be
awkward
that
the
lanky
texan
would
then
get
back
on
his
skateboard
while
vlogging
about
it
would
be
another
plus
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
