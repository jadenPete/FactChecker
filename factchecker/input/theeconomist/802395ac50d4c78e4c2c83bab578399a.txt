foreign
travellers
to
america
face
scrutiny
of
their
online
activity
people
applying
for
a
visa
must
disclose
email
addresses
and
social-media
accounts
most
travellers
to
america
know
never
to
joke
with
immigration
officials
consider
the
miserable
fate
of
a
young
briton
leigh
van
bryan
who
warmed-up
for
a
holiday
in
los
angeles
seven
years
ago
by
posting
some
excited
tweets
before
flying
he
trumpeted
plans
to
destroy
america
meaning
he
would
party
hard
drink
lots
of
alcohol
and
possibly
wake
up
with
a
tiger
in
the
bathroom
he
also
joked
about
digging
up
the
grave
of
marilyn
monroe
dour
officials
from
the
department
of
homeland
security
who
spotted
his
posts
saw
nothing
to
snigger
about
on
arrival
he
and
a
friend
were
detained
and
interrogated
for
hours
as
investigators
accused
them
of
plotting
crimes
both
were
expelled
despite
protesting
their
innocence
in
the
years
since
would-be
travellers
have
grown
warier
of
what
they
post
online
most
western
europeans
for
example
may
visit
without
a
visa
after
making
an
online
request
for
a
waiver
in
over
m
travellers
did
but
since
december
applicants
have
been
asked
not
only
to
list
countries
they
have
visited
woe
betide
those
who
have
been
to
iran
but
also
to
volunteer
details
of
their
social-media
accounts
and
usernames
the
idea
apparently
is
for
officials
to
screen
for
wrongdoers
and
terrorist
sympathisers
the
brennan
centre
for
justice
a
think-tank
has
just
published
a
report
on
officials
scrutiny
of
travellers
social-media
posts
it
frets
that
president
donald
trump's
call
for
extreme
vetting
of
foreigners
is
turning
into
an
ever
more
intrusive
policy
regime
it
notes
that
a
national
vetting
centre
opened
in
december
describing
it
as
a
presidentially
created
clearing-house
and
co-ordination
centre
for
vetting
information
mostly
for
those
visa
waivers
this
initiative
does
look
troubling
information
once
voluntarily
provided
now
becomes
obligatory
in
may
the
state
department
made
it
compulsory
for
certain
types
of
visa
applicants
comprising
some
people
a
year
to
give
every
detail
of
their
social-media
activity
including
their
usernames
on
different
platforms
over
the
previous
five
years
that
appeared
to
be
aimed
at
applicants
from
muslim
countries
affected
by
a
travel
ban
the
order
has
been
expanded
to
almost
every
visitor
from
this
month
the
state
department
now
obliges
all
visitors
to
offer
details
of
their
identities
on
any
of
different
social-media
platforms
as
well
as
any
email
addresses
phone
numbers
and
other
personal
contact
information
the
new
process
affects
some
m
travellers
a
year
mostly
non-immigrant
temporary
visitors
it
is
not
clear
how
officials
will
store
share
and
use
that
information
does
this
amount
to
unacceptable
scrutiny
even
an
authoritarian
turn
it
is
not
new
in
kind
as
the
hapless
mr
van
bryan
learned
nothing
previously
stopped
officials
from
checking
on
visitors
public
online
statements
but
the
new
regime
is
different
in
scale
so
could
make
such
scrutiny
easier
officials
retort
that
a
decision
to
deny
anyone
entry
will
never
be
based
solely
on
social-media
statements
several
worries
linger
the
brennan
centre
frets
that
wholesale
monitoring
of
social
media
creates
serious
risks
to
privacy
and
free
speech
that
includes
the
privacy
and
speech
of
americans
since
scrutiny
online
looks
at
how
foreigners
interact
with
those
already
inside
america
how
masses
of
personal
data
are
shared
between
security
agencies
is
opaque
it
seems
likely
that
foreigners
applying
for
visas
will
self-censor
online
for
fear
of
having
their
applications
rejected
more
practical
concerns
also
exist
bureaucrats
may
be
ill-equipped
to
study
five
years
of
online
posts
in
hundreds
of
different
languages
of
m
people
each
year
instead
the
online
activity
of
certain
individuals
such
as
young
muslim
men
could
be
unfairly
targeted
migration
lawyers
also
say
paperwork
for
applicants
coming
to
america
already
long
and
tedious
is
getting
too
unwieldy
equally
troubling
is
a
fear
of
retaliation
what
stops
immigration
officials
in
russia
turkey
china
or
elsewhere
demanding
that
all
american
travellers
give
up
details
of
their
emails
and
social-media
accounts
