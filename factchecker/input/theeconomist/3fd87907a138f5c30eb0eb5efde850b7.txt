a

paper
quantifies
how
quickly

elites
recovered

took
hold
in

john
steinbeck
allegedly
quipped
because
the
poor
saw
themselves
not
as
an
exploited
proletariat
but
as
temporarily
embarrassed
millionaires
yet
in
the
case
of
southern
slaveholders
who
lost
much
of
their
wealth
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
america
and
general
william
sherman's
scorched-earth
march
to
the
sea
those
millionaires
who
were
indeed
temporarily
embarrassed
seemed
to
recover
quite
quickly
that
is
the
surprising
result
of
a
meticulous
study
of
historical
census
data
by
three
economists
philipp
ager
leah
boustan
and
katherine
eriksson
before
the
civil
war
the
south
was
deeply
unequal
among
white
households
those
at
the
th
percentile
of
the
wealth
distribution
owned
times
as
much
as
those
at
the
median
by
contrast
in
today's
seemingly
inegalitarian
times
the
ratio
among
white
households
is
just
to
one
roughly
of
the
wealth
in
the
antebellum
south
was
held
in
slaves
after
the
surrender
of
the
confederacy
in
all
this
disappeared
wealth
for
the
top
dropped
by
between
the
censuses
of
and
this
had
the
effect
of
reducing
inequality
but
only
temporarily
by
the
next
census
in
the
sons
of
slaveholders
had
recovered
the
wealth
standings
of
their
fathers
compared
with
those
who
grew
up
in
non-slaveholding
households
by
they
had
surpassed
them
after
ruling
out
other
possible
explanations
such
as
greater
skills
or
business
acumen
the
economists
interpret
this
recovery
as
the
result
of
elite
networks
acting
as
an
invisible
safety-net
the
sons
of
slaveholders
married
into
wealthy
families
and
obtained
well-compensated
white-collar
work
reversing
even
large
declines
in
fortunes
a
long
line
of
economists
from
john
maynard
keynes
to
thomas
piketty
have
noted
that
wealth
begets
wealth
but
an
opposite
dynamic
has
been
observed
in
studies
of
black
americans
more
than
years
after
the
end
of
slavery
a
study
of
all
americans
born
between
and
by
economists
raj
chetty
nathaniel
hendren
maggie
jones
and
sonya
porter
found
that
even
the
black
sons
of
wealthy
parents
exhibited
extraordinary
downward
mobility
relative
to
whites
they
also
had
much
higher
rates
of
incarceration
unlike
white
slaveholders
after
the
civil
war
intergenerational
transmission
of
black
wealth
one
century
later
seems
much
more
fragile

intergenerational
effects
of
a
large
wealth
shock
