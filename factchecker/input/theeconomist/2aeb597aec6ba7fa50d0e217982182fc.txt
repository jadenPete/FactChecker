after
robert
mueller's
report
for
the
time
being
the
president
is
above
the
law
the
day
after
robert
mueller's
report
was
made
public
elizabeth
warren
a
contender
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
who
is
polling
in
the
single
digits
tried
to
distinguish
herself
from
the
pack
by
calling
for
donald
trump's
impeachment
a
couple
of
other
candidates
including
kamala
harris
weakly
echoed
her
call
democratic
congressional
leaders
by
contrast
did
not
nancy
pelosi
the
speaker
of
the
house
has
spent
the
days
since
april
th
when
mr
mueller's
report
came
out
tamping
down
calls
from
her
left
flank
to
start
impeachment
proceedings
her
second-in-command
steny
hoyer
believes
that
going
forward
on
impeachment
is
not
worthwhile
mr
mueller
described
a
level
of
presidential
misbehaviour
that
would
be
shocking
were
it
not
for
the
frog-boiling
nature
of
living
through
the
trump
presidency
yet
republicans
overwhelmingly
back
the
president
which
makes
removing
mr
trump
from
office
a
dim
prospect
democrats
fear
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
remove
mr
trump
would
help
the
president
but
just
moving
on
as
if
it
were
business
as
usual
seems
unacceptable
too
signalling
as
it
would
that
the
only
limit
to
the
power
of
presidents
is
what
they
can
get
away
with
politically
how
congress
and
american
political
institutions
respond
in
the
coming
weeks
to
mr
mueller's
report
will
set
precedents
that
could
last
for
decades
mr
trump
insists
that
he
is
not
even
a
little
bit
worried
about
impeachment
only
high
crimes
and
misdemeanours
can
lead
to
impeachment
he
tweeted
there
were
no
crimes
by
me
no
collusion
no
obstruction
so
you
can't
impeach
this
is
an
imperfect
reading
of
the
evidence
against
him
and
of
historical
precedent
in
andrew
johnson
was
impeached
for
among
other
things
bringing
the
presidency
into
contempt
ridicule
and
disgrace
which
is
not
a
crime
presidential
campaigns
often
pay
fines
for
violating
campaign-finance
laws
but
no
rational
person
would
argue
that
those
peccadillos
constitute
impeachable
offences
gerald
ford
who
became
president
after
richard
nixon
resigned
rather
than
face
impeachment
cynically
but
accurately
said
that
an
impeachable
offence
is
whatever
a
majority
of
the
house
of
representatives
considers
it
to
be
at
a
given
moment
in
history
in
the
house
decided
that
lying
to
a
grand
jury
and
tampering
with
witnesses
constituted
impeachable
offences
against
bill
clinton
in
the
house
felt
that
obstructing
a
federal
investigation
abusing
executive
power
and
ignoring
subpoenas
constituted
impeachable
offences
committed
by
nixon
neither
president
was
removed
nor
was
johnson
who
escaped
by
a
single
senate
vote
where
does
the
behaviour
chronicled
in
the
mueller
report
stand
on
the
johnson-nixon-clinton
scale
mr
mueller's
investigation
did
not
establish
that
members
of
the
trump
campaign
conspired
or
co-ordinated
with
the
russian
government
in
its
election
interference
activities
yet
the
two
sides
were
working
towards
the
same
goal
mr
trump's
election
and
were
eager
to
help
each
other
russian
outreach
began
not
long
after
mr
trump
announced
his
candidacy
by
spring
a
russian-linked
professor
was
offering
dirt
on
hillary
clinton's
campaign
to
one
of
mr
trump's
foreign-policy
advisers
that
summer
donald
trump
junior
jared
kushner
mr
trump's
son-in-law
and
adviser
and
paul
manafort
his
campaign
chairman
met
a
russian
lawyer
who
promised
official
documents
and
information
that
would
incriminate
hillary
mr
manafort
shared
internal
campaign
data
with
konstantin
kilimnik
an
employee
of
his
who
both
american
intelligence
and
rick
gates
mr
manafort's
right-hand
man
believed
had
links
to
russian
intelligence
meanwhile
russian
military-intelligence
officers
were
hacking
into
and
stealing
documents
from
democratic
party
servers
and
email
accounts
of
people
working
for
mrs
clinton's
campaign
and
employees
of
the
internet
research
agency
a
company
based
in
st
petersburg
were
building
fake
social-media
accounts
that
reached
as
many
as
m
people
both
spooks
and
trolls
repeatedly
helped
mr
trump
the
trolls
staged
pro-trump
rallies
in
at
least
three
states
five
hours
after
mr
trump
asked
russia
if
you're
listening
to
find
emails
that
mrs
clinton
supposedly
deleted
the
spooks
began
targeting
mrs
clinton's
personal
office
an
hour
after
a
television
network
released
a
video
of
mr
trump
boasting
about
sexual
assault
wikileaks
released
thousands
of
emails
stolen
from
mrs
clinton's
campaign
chairman
by
the
gru
russia's
military-intelligence
agency
had
mr
trump
not
dulled
the
word
collusion
through
overuse
it
might
seem
to
describe
the
relationship
between
his
campaign
and
the
russian
government
mutual
aid
coupled
with
persistent
dissembling
two
former
trump
campaign
officials
have
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
federal
investigators
about
their
contacts
with
russia
the
president's
personal
lawyer
testified
that
mr
trump
knew
of
and
directed
the
trump-moscow
negotiations
to
build
a
tower
there
throughout
the
campaign
and
lied
about
it
mr
mueller
says
that
his
report
may
not
provide
a
full
picture
of
trump-russia
links
because
people
they
interviewed
sometimes
provided
information
that
was
false
or
incomplete
while
others
deleted
relevant
communications
the
second
part
of
mr
mueller's
report
concerns
obstruction
of
justice
before
becoming
attorney
general
william
barr
wrote
a
memo
arguing
that
a
president
could
not
obstruct
justice
through
the
lawful
exercise
of
his
powers
mr
mueller
demolishes
that
theory
in
his
summary
mr
barr
cited
the
absence
of
an
underlying
crime
conspiring
with
russia
and
mr
trump's
habit
of
carrying
out
his
obstructive
acts
in
public
often
via
twitter
as
mitigating
circumstances
mr
mueller
did
not
have
time
for
that
either
mr
barr
said
that
the
president
was
frustrated
and
angered
by
a
sincere
belief
that
the
investigation
was
undermining
his
presidency
but
there
is
no
exception
for
hurt
feelings
in
the
obstruction
statutes
mr
barr
also
said
that
the
white
house
fully
co-operated
with
the
probe
in
fact
mr
trump
refused
to
be
interviewed
submitting
only
written
answers
mr
mueller
sniffed
at
the
insufficiency
of
those
responses
noting
that
mr
trump
claimed
some
form
of
memory
failure
more
than
times
other
answers
were
incomplete
or
imprecise
mr
barr
decided
that
the
evidence
failed
to
establish
that
mr
trump
obstructed
justice
mr
mueller
does
not
seem
so
certain
while
this
report
does
not
conclude
that
the
president
committed
a
crime
it
also
does
not
exonerate
him
certainly
the
president
engaged
in
conduct
that
a
layman
might
consider
obstructive
he
fired
james
comey
the
fbi
director
after
mr
comey
did
not
accede
to
mr
trump's
request
that
he
lift
the
cloud
of
this
russia
business
and
publicly
state
that
the
president
was
not
under
investigation
he
tried
to
get
jeff
sessions
his
former
attorney
general
to
curtail
mr
mueller's
investigation
he
repeatedly
tried
to
compel
subordinates
to
lie
about
matters
under
investigation
he
told
don
mcgahn
the
white
house
counsel
to
sack
mr
mueller
mr
mcgahn
who
comes
out
rather
well
refused
complaining
that
the
president
had
asked
him
to
do
crazy
shit
the
president's
efforts
to
influence
the
investigation
were
mostly
unsuccessful
mr
mueller
wrote
but
that
is
largely
because
the
persons
who
surrounded
the
president
declined
to
carry
out
orders
or
accede
to
his
requests
mr
mueller
declined
to
recommend
prosecution
because
justice
department
guidelines
warn
against
indicting
a
sitting
president
but
he
left
open
the
prospect
of
a
post-presidential
indictment
noting
that
he
gathered
evidence
now
when
memories
were
fresh
and
documentary
materials
were
available
and
he
recognised
that
the
separation-of-powers
doctrine
authorises
congress
to
protect
official
proceedings
from
corrupt
obstructive
acts
regardless
of
their
source
congressional
democrats
do
not
agree
on
what
such
protection
means
in
practice
the
progressive
wing
was
already
keen
to
impeach
mr
mueller's
report
just
added
some
petrol
to
their
fire
but
that
makes
impeachment
look
partisan
rather
than
evidence-based
which
will
make
joining
them
harder
for
the
moderates
from
swing
districts
that
democrats
rely
on
for
their
majority
a
politico
morning
consult
poll
taken
after
the
mueller
report's
release
shows
mr
trump's
approval
rating
at
tying
an
all-time
low
but
still
five
points
higher
than
support
for
impeachment
that
could
change
if
further
malfeasance
comes
to
light
democrats
are
chasing
mr
trump's
tax
returns
and
may
start
yanking
on
threads
mr
mueller
left
dangling
who
destroyed
evidence
and
why
if
mr
trump
really
is
innocent
why
was
his
reaction
on
learning
of
mr
mueller's
appointment
to
slump
back
in
his
chair
and
say
oh
my
god
this
is
terrible
this
is
the
end
of
my
presidency
i'm
fucked
the
white
house
is
already
resisting
the
democrats
efforts
to
subpoena
some
of
those
named
in
mr
mueller's
report
contending
that
they
are
politically
motivated
legally
that
argument
is
weak
but
the
political
salience
of
obstruction
may
wane
during
a
long
court
fight
others
have
tried
to
minimise
mr
mueller's
findings
mr
kushner
said
that
the
investigation
harmed
america
more
than
russian
election-meddling
did
rudy
giuliani
one
of
mr
trump's
lawyers
said
that
he
saw
nothing
wrong
in
accepting
help
from
russia
impeding
a
federal
investigation
and
accepting
help
from
a
foreign
adversary
are
precisely
the
sorts
of
offences
that
the
founders
would
have
considered
impeachable
james
madison
considered
impeachment
a
remedy
for
perfidy
peculation
self-dealing
from
public
funds
and
betray
ing
trust
to
foreign
powers
the
justice
department
warns
against
indicting
a
president
because
the
impeachment
process
ensures
that
the
immunity
from
indictment
would
not
place
the
president
above
the
law
but
if
that
process
is
not
applicable
to
a
president
whose
party
controls
a
chamber
of
congress
then
in
practical
terms
the
president
is
protected
from
both
indictment
and
impeachment
he
is
above
the
law
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the

court's

term
