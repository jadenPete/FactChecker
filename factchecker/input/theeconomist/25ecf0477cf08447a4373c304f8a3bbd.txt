democrats
should
take
a
good
look
at
amy
klobuchar
the
senator
for
minnesota
may
be
the
opponent
donald
trump
would
least
like
to
face
two
supporters
showed
up
on
norwegian
cross-country
skis
another
pair
stomped
about
happily
in
snow
shoes
dogs
came
wrapped
in
brightly
coloured
winter
gear
amy
klobuchar's
campaign
launch
in
minneapolis
was
not
for
the
faint-hearted
or
anyone
who
had
forgotten
to
bring
their
gloves
ms
klobuchar
is
not
widely
known
early
polls
which
are
not
worth
much
anyway
do
not
put
her
near
the
front
of
the
pack
in
the
democratic
primary
yet
of
all
the
candidates
who
have
so
far
declared
the
senator
for
minnesota
may
be
the
opponent
donald
trump
would
least
like
to
face
in
a
general
election
if
that
is
the
most
important
consideration
for
democratic
primary
voters
ms
klobuchar
should
be
taken
very
seriously
just
as
it
is
hard
to
kindle
a
fire
in
wet
snow
she
could
struggle
to
generate
much
heat
or
light
in
a
busy
democratic
field
ms
klobuchar
is
not
from
a
rich
family
nor
is
she
backed
by
big
donors
most
of
whom
are
found
in
cities
on
the
coasts
in
a
brief
chat
with
the
economist
she
says
i
don't
pretend
that
i'm
the
one
with
all
the
money
right
now
but
we
will
raise
the
money
that's
necessary
once
people
see
me
out
in
the
snow
i
don't
know
how
they
can't
help
but
give
me
money
lack
of
dollars
is
not
her
only
problem
as
a
quietly
industrious
toiler
and
sometimes
uninspiring
orator
she
is
not
well-known
she
has
some
other
disadvantages
in
a
crowded
primary
field
younger
or
more
left-wing
democrats
have
grabbed
attention
by
promising
universal
health
care
soon
ms
klobuchar
talks
more
carefully
of
that
as
an
eventual
goal
some
want
to
abolish
ice
the
federal
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
she
talks
instead
of
welcoming
migrants
and
ending
hatred
towards
foreigners
others
are
likelier
than
ms
klobuchar
to
appeal
to
african-american
voters
who
will
have
a
big
say
in
the
early
primary
states
despite
all
that
do
not
write
off
ms
klobuchar
she
combines
a
wonkish
seriousness
with
easy
joke-making
in
a
way
that
has
broad
appeal
she
was
the
first
female
senator
from
minnesota
and
has
won
each
victory
by
impressively
large
margins
over
credible
opponents
ms
klobuchar
scores
highly
on
measures
of
electability
an
effort
to
quantify
a
candidate's
electoral
success
when
allowing
for
national
trends
the
benefits
of
incumbency
and
other
factors
in
when
she
was
re-elected
as
one
of
minnesota's
senators
she
performed
vastly
better
in
the
state
than
hillary
clinton
had
two
years
earlier
ms
klobuchar
even
won
the
two
house
districts
in
minnesota
that
switched
from
democratic
in
to
republican
in
she
does
well
in
rural
areas
including
winning
in
in
counties
that
mr
trump
took
easily
in
plot
obama-trump
voters
those
who
switched
from
barack
obama
in
to
mr
trump
in
on
a
map
and
you
will
find
a
high
concentration
in
the
midwest
ms
klobuchar
has
already
been
a
fairly
frequent
visitor
to
neighbouring
iowa
campaigning
for
fellow
democrats
in
territory
which
is
a
similar
mixture
of
farming
industry
and
growing
cities
to
that
found
in
minnesota
it
is
possible
that
her
consensual
centrist
demeanour
will
go
down
well
with
many
iowans
if
polls
there
and
in
turn
caucuses
next
year
show
the
minnesotan
is
popular
in
the
midwest
then
her
name
recognition
will
improve
and
her
money
problems
will
ease
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
