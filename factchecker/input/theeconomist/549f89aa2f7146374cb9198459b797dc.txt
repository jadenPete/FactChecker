before
the
federal
government
did
not
shut
down
jimmy
carter's
attorney-general
changed
how
america
is
governed
public-relations
professionals
know
that
the
best
time
to
release
bad
news
is
late
on
friday
afternoons
hacks
and
their
editors
have
one
foot
out
of
the
door
nobody
wants
to
put
their
weekend
plans
on
hold
to
start
a
new
story
america
has
recently
discovered
that
a
similar
rule
holds
true
for
government
shutdowns
if
it
happens
just
before
christmas
when
federal
workers
are
already
on
holiday
and
nobody
is
paying
much
attention
to
the
news
then
the
waste
and
pain
will
not
seep
into
the
headlines
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now
that
quiet
period
has
passed
rubbish
is
piling
up
in
national
parks
farmers
cannot
get
their
loans
processed
food-stamp
programmes
are
running
out
of
funds
tax
refunds
may
be
delayed
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
federal
workers
remain
either
stuck
at
home
or
forced
to
work
without
pay
to
reopen
the
government
president
donald
trump
demands
bn
for
his
border
wall
nancy
pelosi
who
presides
over
the
most
polarised
house
of
representatives
in
recent
memory
does
not
want
to
give
it
to
him
if
this
shutdown
the
third
in
the
past
year
stretches
into
next
week
it
will
become
the
longest
in
american
history
how
did
the
world's
most
powerful
government
become
so
dysfunctional
the
roots
of
this
shutdown
lie
in
two
places
an
attorney-general's
memo
written
in
and
mr
trump's
campaign
before
federal
agencies
often
operated
during
funding
gaps
meaning
before
congress
had
appropriated
the
required
money
they
tried
to
stay
lean
to
avoid
going
too
far
into
the
red
but
reasoned
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
close
them
it
merely
had
not
yet
got
around
to
formally
providing
their
funding
in
however
benjamin
civiletti
then
the
attorney-general
opined
that
the
only
way
that
agencies
could
avoid
violating
the
antideficiency
act
which
forbids
the
government
from
spending
money
that
has
not
been
appropriated
is
to
cease
operating
until
congress
funds
them
the
act's
authority
stems
from
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
government
spending
public
money
unless
the
people
via
their
representatives
have
authorised
it
to
do
so
the
only
exceptions
concerned
the
safety
of
human
life
or
the
protection
of
property
which
exempts
active-duty
military
who
are
still
working
and
getting
paid
and
federal
airport-security
workers
who
are
working
but
not
getting
paid
mr
civiletti's
determination
made
funding
gaps
less
frequent
they
were
no
longer
technical
and
ignorable
glitches
they
became
in
effect
temporary
closure
orders
which
made
them
costly
and
embarrassing
but
it
also
turned
government
funding
into
a
hostage-taking
mechanism
in
late
the
republican-controlled
house
led
by
newt
gingrich
produced
a
spending
bill
with
deep
cuts
to
social-welfare
programmes
that
were
anathema
to
then-president
bill
clinton
mr
clinton
refused
to
sign
it
and
the
government
shut
down
first
for
six
days
and
then
for
the
shutdown
ended
when
congress
and
the
white
house
hammered
out
a
budget
deal
with
modest
spending
cuts
and
tax
hikes
in
effect
republicans
caved
although
mr
gingrich
received
most
of
the
blame
for
the
shutdown
and
mr
clinton
was
easily
re-elected
it
arguably
pushed
the
president's
agenda
rightward
still
the
opprobrium
resulting
from
the
government
ceasing
to
function
for
nearly
a
month
was
sufficient
for
mr
gingrich
never
to
try
it
again
another
generation
of
republican
insurgents
tried
in
when
they
insisted
as
a
condition
of
passing
a
budget
that
the
affordable
care
act
barack
obama's
signature
achievement
be
delayed
or
defunded
that
shutdown
which
lasted
days
also
ended
with
republicans
surrendering
without
getting
what
they
demanded
but
neither
did
they
pay
a
political
cost
the
next
year
they
took
control
of
the
senate
like
these
two
previous
shutdowns
this
one
is
republican-led
unlike
the
past
two
however
it
stems
from
the
president
trying
to
impose
his
will
on
congress
rather
than
the
inverse
absent
mr
trump's
insistence
on
bn
for
his
wall
a
spending
bill
could
easily
pass
both
houses
of
congress
this
is
not
a
hard
shutdown
says
michael
steel
who
was
a
spokesman
for
john
boehner
the
house
speaker
during
the
shutdown
put
any
number
of
bipartisan
senators
in
a
room
with
a
cocktail
napkin
and
they
could
figure
this
out
instead
of
senators
huddled
around
a
cocktail
napkin
america
was
treated
to
mr
trump
and
democratic
congressional
leaders
making
their
cases
on
prime-time
tv
mr
trump
called
the
border
a
pipeline
for
vast
quantities
of
illegal
drugs
though
most
come
through
ports
of
entry
and
a
wall
would
not
stop
them
the
number
of
migrants
apprehended
at
the
border
rose
late
last
year
but
from
record
lows
overall
numbers
are
far
below
where
they
were
a
decade
ago
if
there
is
a
crisis
it
is
in
america's
creepingly
slow-moving
asylum
system
yet
that
is
a
far
less
compelling
argument
than
mr
trump's
assertion
that
foreigners
are
sneaking
across
the
border
to
behead
american
citizens
and
that
the
only
way
to
stop
them
is
to
build
a
big
wall
chuck
schumer
the
democratic
leader
in
the
senate
reiterated
his
party's
offer
continue
negotiating
over
border
security
and
pass
bills
to
reopen
the
other
shuttered
parts
of
the
government
most
senate
republicans
would
happily
accept
this
deal
some
who
are
up
for
re-election
in
two
years
such
as
cory
gardner
of
colorado
and
susan
collins
of
maine
have
begun
pushing
for
a
resolution
without
a
wall
even
john
cornyn
of
texas
the
majority
whip
until
recently
backed
the
sort
of
hybrid
solution
physical
barriers
along
with
technology
drones
and
more
personnel
that
democrats
could
support
but
far
more
republican
senators
face
re-election
in
solidly
republican
states
next
year
and
they
fear
a
primary
challenge
from
the
right
more
than
losing
to
a
democrat
hence
mitch
mcconnell
the
senate
majority
leader
vowed
not
to
bring
forward
a
bill
that
the
president
does
not
support
despite
having
called
shutdowns
a
failed
policy
in
when
he
also
urged
the
then-democratic
senate
to
set
national
priorities
rather
than
simply
waiting
on
the
white
house
to
do
it
for
his
part
mr
trump
feels
he
holds
a
winning
hand
immigration
hawkishness
helped
propel
him
to
victory
in
and
remains
crucial
to
satisfying
his
base
though
a
recent
reuters
poll
showed
that
most
americans
blame
him
for
the
shutdown
perhaps
because
he
accepted
blame
in
a
televised
interview
earlier
polling
data
suggest
that
may
fade
by
during
the
two
previous
extended
shutdowns
approval
ratings
for
the
incumbent
presidents
both
fell
but
they
rebounded
relatively
quickly
yet
that
pattern
may
not
hold
if
this
shutdown
lasts
months
members
of
both
parties
fear
that
mr
trump
will
reach
not
for
mr
schumer's
solution
but
a
more
drastic
one
invoking
emergency
powers
to
circumvent
congress
and
build
a
wall
using
previously
authorised
military
funds
that
would
set
a
precedent
that
terrifies
conservative
senators
what
is
to
stop
a
future
democratic
president
from
doing
the
same
thing
to
deal
with
climate
change
or
guns
it
would
also
precipitate
a
genuine
constitutional
crisis
and
a
fierce
court
battle
perversely
that
could
suit
mr
trump
well
he
may
not
get
his
wall
but
he
would
get
to
keep
fighting
for
it
and
he
would
still
have
useful
enemies
judges
democrats
to
blame
for
it
having
not
been
built
yet
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
