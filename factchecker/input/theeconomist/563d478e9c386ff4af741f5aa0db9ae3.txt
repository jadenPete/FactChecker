donald
trump
does
away
with
another
member
of
his
cabinet
the
president
will
struggle
to
get
what
he
wants
at
the
border
secretary
of
homeland
security
kirstjen
nielsen
will
be
leaving
her
position
and
i
would
like
to
thank
her
for
her
service
tweeted
donald
trump
on
the
afternoon
of
april
th
ms
nielsen
stepped
down
on
april
th
but
she
had
been
twisting
in
the
wind
for
months
though
she
had
publicly
defended
mr
trump's
immigration
policies
the
president
thought
her
weak
her
departure
seems
to
presage
a
harsher
turn
on
immigration
from
a
president
who
considers
the
issue
central
to
his
re-election
strategy
few
on
the
left
will
sympathise
with
ms
nielsen
she
was
one
of
the
faces
of
the
trump
administration's
zero
tolerance
policy
under
which
anyone
who
crossed
america's
border
illegally
was
referred
to
the
justice
department
for
prosecution
that
resulted
in
the
separation
of
thousands
of
children
from
their
parents
identifying
all
the
families
thus
sundered
said
the
government
in
a
court
document
filed
last
week
could
take
up
to
two
years
she
also
defended
two
policies
halted
to
mr
trump's
fury
by
federal
courts
one
that
would
have
prevented
anyone
who
crossed
the
border
illegally
from
claiming
asylum
and
another
that
would
force
asylum
seekers
to
wait
in
mexico
rather
than
america
while
their
claims
were
evaluated
she
reportedly
almost
resigned
last
year
after
mr
trump
publicly
berated
her
for
failing
to
stop
illegal
immigration
then
she
improved
her
standing
with
the
president
last
autumn
after
the
border
patrol
fired
tear-gas
into
mexico
at
unarmed
protesters
but
the
president
had
grown
increasingly
agitated
in
recent
months
as
the
number
of
border
apprehensions
rose
though
they
remain
far
below
their
levels
of
a
decade
ago
the
administration's
decision
last
week
to
withdraw
the
nomination
of
ronald
vitiello
to
lead
the
border
patrol
which
ms
nielsen
had
backed
suggested
the
writing
was
on
the
wall
mr
trump
said
he
wanted
to
go
in
a
tougher
direction
after
returning
from
a
visit
to
the
southern
border
last
weekend
he
demanded
and
received
ms
nielsen's
resignation
her
departing
letter
sounded
a
trumpian
tone
blaming
congress
and
the
courts
for
not
fixing
the
laws
which
have
impeded
our
ability
to
fully
secure
america's
borders
and
which
have
contributed
to
discord
in
our
nation's
discourse
her
departure
and
that
on
april
th
of
claire
grady
the
acting
deputy
secretary
leaves
mr
trump's
chosen
successor
kevin
mcaleenan
as
acting
homeland-security
secretary
he
thus
becomes
the
sixth
current
interim
holder
of
a
cabinet-level
position
how
long
he
will
last
is
unclear
as
is
the
full
scope
of
his
power
on
april
th
mr
trump
announced
that
there's
only
one
person
running
immigration
policy
you
know
who
that
is
it's
me
the
problem
is
that
mr
trump
seems
to
want
to
do
things
that
american
law
does
not
allow
and
among
the
things
that
reportedly
soured
him
on
ms
nielsen
were
her
reminders
that
legal
constraints
existed
the
new
york
times
reported
that
he
demanded
that
ms
nielsen
should
stop
migrants
from
claiming
asylum
which
is
both
illegal
and
impossible
shortly
before
his
most
recent
visit
to
the
border
the
president
said
america
needs
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
asylum
system
and
get
rid
of
judges
he
reportedly
told
border
policemen
to
break
the
law
and
deny
asylum-seekers
entry
to
america
our
country
is
full
mr
trump
declared
on
april
th
at
the
mexican
border
we
can't
take
you
any
more
so
turn
around
that's
the
way
it
is
more
departures
from
homeland
security
may
soon
follow
including
the
department's
general
counsel
and
the
head
of
citizenship
and
immigration
services
on
april
th
mr
trump
also
announced
that
randolph
alles
would
step
down
as
head
of
the
secret
service
though
that
may
be
connected
to
an
embarrassing
security
breach
at
mar-a-lago
his
florida
country
club
stopping
the
tide
of
migrants
completely
is
beyond
the
power
of
any
homeland-security
secretary
but
it
is
not
beyond
their
power
to
try
or
at
least
to
appear
on
television
to
be
trying
and
then
blame
democrats
and
feckless
judges
for
any
failures
the
president
seems
to
like
that
sort
of
performance
more
than
any
realistic
policy
throughout
his
time
in
office
mr
trump
has
preferred
fighting
public
battles
on
immigration
and
much
else
to
the
unglamorous
work
of
compromise
and
governance
as
next
year's
election
approaches
that
attitude
may
become
even
more
apparent
immigration
policy
offers
the
sharpest
possible
contrast
between
mr
trump
and
most
democrats
that
helped
put
him
in
office
two
years
ago
ms
nielsen's
departure
and
the
tougher
direction
he
claims
to
want
suggest
that
he
is
gearing
up
to
fight
the
same
battle
again
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
