the
irish
conquest
of
america
this
st
patrick's
day
irish-americans
can
celebrate
the
blarneyfication
of
their
democracy
when
john
hearne
ireland's
ambassador
to
washington
sent
harry
truman
a
box
of
shamrocks
on
st
patrick's
day
in
he
could
not
have
imagined
he
was
launching
the
greatest
exercise
in
soft
power
yet
it
is
hard
to
think
of
a
rival
to
the
annual
shamrock
ceremony
and
its
attendant
rituals
on
march
th
leo
varadkar
the
sixth
consecutive
irish
taoiseach
to
conduct
them
will
celebrate
st
patrick's
day
by
breakfasting
with
vice-president
mike
pence
he
will
be
feted
at
a
lunch
on
capitol
hill
attended
by
donald
trump
he
will
proceed
with
the
president
wearing
a
green
tie
possibly
on
the
long
side
to
the
white
house
for
the
plant
handover
they
will
meanwhile
hold
the
only
annually
scheduled
substantive
talks
america
affords
any
foreign
leader
this
is
great
for
ireland
for
the
inconvenience
of
having
to
buy
lots
of
green
ties
the
current
ambassador
has
around
its
representatives
enjoy
unrivalled
access
to
the
superpower
the
notion
that
america
might
favour
britain
over
ireland
in
any
post-brexit
wrangle
a
fear
mr
varadkar
is
expected
to
raise
is
untenable
yet
ireland's
soft-power
triumph
is
mainly
testament
to
the
continued
enthusiasm
of
m
irish-americans
for
their
roots
and
to
their
equally
remarkable
dominance
of
american
politics
besides
mr
pence
two
of
whose
grandparents
were
born
in
ireland
the
republican
house
leader
kevin
mccarthy
is
irish-american
as
was
his
predecessor
paul
ryan
and
their
senate
counterpart
mitch
mcconnell
among
the
many
other
irish-americans
who
have
served
mr
trump
are
his
sometime
advisers
steve
bannon
and
kellyanne
conway
and
his
current
and
former
chiefs
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
and
john
kelly
mr
mulvaney
whose
daughter
is
studying
in
dublin
helped
organise
a
tree-planting
on
capitol
hill
to
commemorate
the
centenary
of
the
easter
rising
this
is
in
a
sense
par
for
the
course
barack
obama's
administration
was
also
full
of
irish-americans
including
joe
biden
his
yeats-quoting
deputy
who
is
expected
to
announce
a
presidential
run
shortly
mr
o'bama
geddit
also
promoted
his
own
irish
ancestry
as
did
his
five
immediate
predecessors
there
are
a
few
reasons
for
this
celtic
pre-eminence
they
include
the
role
of
the
catholic
church
the
english
language
and
the
relatively
even
gender-balance
of
the
m
irish
who
came
to
america
between
and
they
helped
keep
irish-american
communities
intact
the
fact
that
many
were
and
are
in
political
hotspots
such
as
ohio
and
pennsylvania
also
boosted
their
political
relevance
and
activity
so
does
a
propensity
to
talk
we
do
communications
politics
italians
cook
joshes
niall

of
irish
america
magazine
yet
the
most
significant
factor
because
it
says
a
lot
about
the
broader
state
of
politics
is
a
strong
irish-american
political
culture
rooted
in
anti-elitism
outsiderism
and
grievance
generations
after
most
irish-americans
lost
touch
with
the
old
country
it
is
still
evident
indeed
especially
evident
on
the
right
and
left
today
to
understand
this
consider
that
the
th-century
hordes
were
not
quite
the
naive
starvelings
they
are
often
described
as
they
left
a
country
already
mobilised
by
nationalists
such
as
daniel
o'connell
whose
monster
meetings
drew
hundreds
of
thousands
and
the
heavy
use
irish
nationalists
made
of
america
as
a
rear-base
and
source
of
funds
through
to
the
late
th
century
nurtured
that
awakening
the
easter
rising
was
part-organised
in
america
a
lecture
by
yeats
drew
new
yorkers
in
the
discrimination
irish-americans
faced
at
home
as
the
last
whites
to
become
white
it
is
sometimes
said
politicised
them
further
yet
it
is
notable
that
irish-american
politicians
harped
on
the
feeling
this
inspired
of
struggle
and
two
fingers
to
the
bloody
establishment
long
after
ireland
was
free
and
most
irish-americans
comfortably
middle
class
ireland's
chief
export
has
been
neither
potatoes
nor
linen
but
exiles
and
immigrants
who
have
fought
with
sword
and
pen
for
freedom
enthused
bobby
kennedy
and
that
mutinous
sentiment
is
as
effective
today
for
example
to
display
the
common
touch
of
politicos
such
as
mr
biden
as
it
was
in
launching
the
fenian
movement
or
hiding
the
excesses
of
tammany
hall
mr
biden
who
has
spent
half
a
century
in
front-line
politics
expresses
it
by
quoting
his
mother
jean
finnegan
show
me
the
guy
that
says
something
about
you
joey
she
reportedly
said
ever
since
john
f.
kennedy
drew
the
votes
of
of
irish-americans
they
have
been
peeling
off
to
the
right
about
half
vote
republican
now
growing
prosperity
the
demise
of
organised
labour
and
the
union
of
conservative
catholics
and
the
religious
right
explain
this
yet
despite
switching
parties
and
objectives
their
politicians
retain
the
same
old
spirit
and
tropes
william
f.
buckley
one
of
the
founders
of
modern
conservatism
griped
about
the
greedy
liberal
elite
like
a
dispossessed
peasant-intellectual
mr
bannon
a
former
investment
banker
who
dresses
like
a
scruffy
boyo
rails
against
globalisation
with
the
same
resentful
fury
so
does
the
billionaire
mr
trump
whom
mr
bannon
calls
the
third
irish
president
despite
his
scotch-german
roots
the
style
and
themes
of
irish-american
politics
now
dominate
american
politics
rival
irish-americans
even
sometimes
express
their
political
differences
in
a
parallel
row
over
authentic
irishness
the
catholic
overseers
of
the
st
patrick's
day
parade
in
new
york
barred
gay
irish-americans
until
recently
progressive
irish-americans
hammer
restrictionists
like
mr
bannon
for
betraying
their
migrant
history
this
might
be
considered
the
final
stage
of
the
irish
triumph
in
america
the
blarneyfication
of
its
democracy
and
as
that
phrase
suggests
it
should
be
viewed
cautiously
because
politicians
like
mr
biden
and
mr
bannon
are
not
only
resorting
to
a
proud
political
tradition
to
describe
new
problems
they
have
also
identified
in
irish-american
political
methods
a
time-worn
means
of
self-promotion
as
a
rule
of
thumb
the
more
irish
a
multi-generation
irish-american
politician
sounds
the
more
scepticism
he
or
she
warrants
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
