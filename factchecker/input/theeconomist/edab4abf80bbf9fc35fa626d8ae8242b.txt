what
small-town
america
can
learn
from
a
town
called
hell
an
unusually-named
settlement
in
michigan
escapes
eternal
damnation
the
road
to
hell
is
paved
with
good
tarmac
water
runs
clear
in
its
creek
the
township
in
michigan
has
only
residents
hellians
but
offers
attractions
aplenty
post-office
staff
singe
cards
and
stamp
them
in
blood-red
ink
from
hell
two
bars
the
hell
hole
and
hell
saloon
bustle
with
customers
both
of
them
and
a
mini-golf
course
are
decorated
with
ghouls
and
monsters
chuckling
tourists
browse
a
shopful
of
perdition-themed
souvenirs
most
popular
are
t-shirts
with
slogans
such
as
hell
is
my
happy
place
john
colone
owns
screams
an
ice-cream
stall
and
much
of
the
commercial
centre
his
red-roofed
wedding
chapel
last
year
hosted
marriage
ceremonies
including
ten
same-sex
ones
he
also
threw
three
living
wakes
for
sick
customers
who
wanted
to
party
in
hell
before
they
died
some
people
a
year
pay
to
be
declared
hell's
mayor
for
a
day
tourist-money
generates
local
jobs
the
township
founded
in
supposedly
got
its
name
from
a
visiting
german
who
declared
the
local
weather
hell
or
wonderfully
bright
it
thrived
by
hosting
a
sawmill
and
tavern
but
like
much
of
rural
america
its
economic
prospects
slumped
as
farm
jobs
vanished
hell's
only
church
burned
down
in
and
was
never
rebuilt
says
mr
colone
a
lifelong
resident
he
frets
that
youngsters
leave
and
the
only
people
moving
in
are
senior
citizens
hell
nonetheless
is
a
success
the
midwest's
landscape
is
littered
with
has-been
towns
says
richard
longworth
who
wrote
a
book
about
the
decline
of
similar
places
he
notes
other
settlements
dwindling
much
faster
such
as
gravity
a
farming
town
in
southern
iowa
it
once
had
more
than
people
but
has
steadily
lost
its
pull
especially
after
the
school
and
local
businesses
closed
it
now
has
an
estimated
residents
many
of
them
elderly
rural
towns
survive
by
adapting
hellians
are
creative
in
luring
tourists
preferring
families
who
shop
and
eat
with
gusto
rather
than
the
biker
gangs
that
used
to
flock
in
the
township
won
national
attention
on
june
th
by
hosting
a
strong
party
to
mark
in
especially
cold
weather
when
hell's
creek
freezes
over
television
journalists
are
invited
to
report
from
its
banks
each
autumn
it
hosts
hearsefest
a
spooky
parade
the
result
says
mr
colone
is
visitors
yearly
what
could
others
learn
from
the
boomlet
in
hell
james
and
deborah
fallows
who
visited
towns
and
small
cities
across
america
last
year
published
a
popular
book
celebrating
the
most
successful
they
say
towns
need
local
patriots
often
in
business
who
are
energetic
set
out
grand
plans
and
excite
others
they
also
need
a
clear
civic
story
myth
or
a
lie
that
residents
can
organise
around
being
open
both
to
migrants
and
visitors
is
important
it
pays
too
not
to
be
truly
remote
being
in
the
orbit
of
a
city
with
a
thriving
university
is
best
of
all
much
of
this
applies
to
hell
half
an
hour
from
ann
arbor
home
to
the
university
of
michigan
some
things
however
are
unique
to
a
town
with
an
odd
name
mr
colone
doubts
that
earlier
generations
would
have
been
as
keen
on
shopping
in
hell
but
says
public
attitudes
have
grown
more
relaxed
hell
