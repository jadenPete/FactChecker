elizabeth
warren
saviour
of
capitalism
the
senator
from
massachusetts's
strong
primary
campaign
suggests
that
ideas
still
matter
there
is
a
revealing
tradition
of
apostasy
in
american
politics
ronald
reagan's
disingenuous
claim
never
to
have
left
the
democratic
party
it
left
me
helped
him
woo
millions
of
blue-collar
democrats
hillary
clinton's
decision
to
downplay
her
early
republicanism
by
contrast
signalled
her
lack
of
ambition
to
win
votes
from
the
other
side
that
donald
trump
switched
camps
at
least
five
times
before
entering
the
republican
primary
suggested
his
disloyalty
to
any
party
elizabeth
warren's
gravitation
from
right
to
left
and
the
use
she
is
making
of
it
in
her
increasingly
fancied
presidential
campaign
is
another
telling
case
unlike
mrs
clinton
she
is
leaning
into
her
republican
past
her
stump
speech
which
lexington
heard
in
a
sun-dappled
new
hampshire
garden
last
week
opens
with
a
description
of
her
conservative
upbringing
in
oklahoma
her
three
brothers
in
uniform
her
frugal
parents
it
testifies
to
her
experience
rare
in
a
former
harvard
law
professor
of
working-class
concerns
and
the
heartland
even
if
she
escaped
both
long
ago
yet
she
remained
a
registered
republican
into
her
late
s
many
democrats
would
find
that
embarrassing
yet
ms
warren
who
entered
politics
over
a
decade
later
after
making
a
name
for
herself
as
a
critic
of
wall
street
after
the
financial
crisis
has
no
need
to
prove
her
left-wing
credentials
she
has
used
her
conversion
story
to
help
distinguish
herself
from
bernie
sanders
her
rival
on
the
left
and
to
try
to
broaden
her
appeal
she
stuck
with
the
republicans
she
has
said
because
she
believed
their
claim
to
be
the
best
market
managers
unlike
the
socialist
from
vermont
she
says
she
is
a
capitalist
to
my
bones
she
left
the
right
after
researching
surging
individual
bankruptcies
which
turned
out
to
be
caused
not
by
fecklessness
but
ill
health
and
other
misfortunes
why
were
so
many
hardworking
people
like
her
parents
living
so
precariously
she
asked
and
why
were
companies
their
soaring
profits
suggested
more
protected
like
mr
sanders
she
considers
the
economy
to
be
not
merely
skewed
but
rigged
in
the
corporate
interest
stagnant
wages
rising
economic
insecurity
outsourced
jobs
are
a
product
of
who
government
works
for
she
said
in
new
hampshire
but
where
mr
sanders
promises
a
revolution
her
proposals
are
more
measured
detailed
and
various
indeed
ms
warren
who
in
a
couple
of
recent
polls
was
ahead
of
mr
sanders
in
second
place
behind
joe
biden
has
unveiled
more
policies
than
her
main
rivals
put
together
her
signature
proposal
is
a
wealth
tax
of
two
cents
on
the
dollar
on
assets
over
m
she
optimistically
claims
this
would
raise
trn
in
a
decade
a
windfall
she
would
splurge
on
progressive
priorities
including
universal
free
childcare
free
public
college
fees
and
writing
off
college
debt
that
is
sanders-esque
with
a
tonal
difference
unlike
mr
sanders
whose
recent
entry
into
the
millionaire
class
seems
not
to
have
lessened
his
dislike
of
rich
people
ms
warren
claims
not
to
begrudge
them
their
success
she
just
wants
them
to
chip
in
more
two
cents
just
two
cents
is
one
of
her
slogans
to
help
expand
opportunity
which
is
another
believe
that
or
not
her
other
main
proposals
are
regulatory
fixes
that
are
far-reaching
and
radical
but
mostly
within
the
democratic
mainstream
channelling
the
spirit
of
her
hero
theodore
roosevelt
she
vows
to
curb
lobbying
campaign-finance
extravagance
carbon
emissions
and
much
else
she
has
hedged
her
support
for
mr
sanders's
promise
of
medicare
for
all
setting
aside
the
merits
of
her
proposals
her
focus
on
policy
is
clever
politics
and
unusual
mrs
clinton's
loss
to
a
candidate
with
no
serious
policies
though
she
had
reams
of
them
has
deterred
most
democratic
candidates
from
issuing
detailed
proposals
mr
biden
the
front-runner
has
two
policies
including
a
cut-and-paste
climate
plan
ms
warren
apprehends
that
mrs
clinton
failed
not
because
she
had
too
many
policies
but
because
she
had
no
theme
to
make
sense
of
them
her
commitment
to
saving
capitalism
from
the
capitalists
is
an
answer
to
that
her
wonkishness
also
helps
her
deal
with
specific
weaknesses
it
has
revised
her
former
image
as
a
one-trick
pony
banging
on
about
wall
street
it
has
moderated
her
reputation
as
a
left-winger
it
has
made
mr
sanders
look
lightweight
by
comparison
it
has
also
helped
neutralise
an
impression
exacerbated
by
sexism
no
doubt
that
she
is
rather
hectoring
she
reminds
me
of
my
sister-in-law
said
one
of
her
listeners
in
new
hampshire
guiltily
but
she
knows
what
she's
talking
about
mrs
clinton's
supporters
were
often
unwilling
to
acknowledge
her
weaknesses
as
a
campaigner
if
ms
warren's
are
more
willing
it
is
because
she
also
has
strengths
she
may
well
supplant
mr
sanders
as
the
main
threat
to
mr
biden
from
the
left
whether
she
could
woo
enough
moderate
voters
to
mount
a
serious
challenge
is
harder
to
predict
it
is
certainly
possible
yet
such
voters
are
mainly
concerned
with
beating
mr
trump
and
may
consider
ms
warren
too
left-wing
for
that
which
would
be
reasonable
or
they
might
consider
her
too
like
mrs
clinton
as
a
woman
in
her
s
which
would
not
be
that
suggests
ms
warren's
ideas
may
get
less
attention
than
they
deserve
on
the
left
meanwhile
they
are
being
studied
by
reform-minded
republicans
grappling
with
the
rejection
of
conservative
verities
that
mr
trump
represents
tucker
carlson
of
fox
news
described
ms
warren's
industrial
policy
as
like
donald
trump
at
his
best
senator
marco
rubio
wrote
a
column
applauding
its
aims
while
concluding
that
a
radical
progressive
movement
would
not
fulfil
them
this
illustrates
a
paradoxical
feature
of
the
political
divide
a
combination
of
intellectual
flux
and
partisan
rigidity
despite
her
past
republicanism
ms
warren
could
not
win
votes
on
the
right
without
repudiating
her
party
in
some
way
by
opposing
mass
immigration
for
example
yet
her
critique
of
american
capitalism
is
quietly
inspiring
conservative
thinkers
it
is
an
odd
time
when
ideas
cross
parties
more
easily
than
people
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
