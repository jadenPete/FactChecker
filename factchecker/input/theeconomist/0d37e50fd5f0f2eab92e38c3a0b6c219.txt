music
lyrics
toil
and
grit
have
been
replaced
by
blonde
hair
and
blue
eyes
with
its
lilting
banjo
cowboy
theme
and
lyrics
like
ridin
on
a
tractor
and
wrangler
on
my
booty
not
to
mention
an
extremely
catchy
refrain
lil
nas
x's
old
town
road
should
be
a
country-music
hit
yet
it
was
kicked
off
the
billboard
country-music
chart
for
not
embracing
enough
elements
of
today's
country
music
billboard
later
told
rolling
stone
magazine
that
its
decision
to
take
the
song
off
the
chart
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
race
of
the
artist
lil
nas
x
the
year-old
african-american
who
blended
hip-hop
rock
and
country
in
his
earworm
of
a
song
does
not
look
like
the
typical
country
star
those
tend
to
be
white
and
most
are
male
one
of
country
music's
greatest
strengths
is
its
ability
to
celebrate
working
folk
in
america
but
that
has
also
been
its
greatest
liability

a
recent
paper
in
rural
sociology
an
academic
journal
examined
how
men
talk
about
themselves
in
mainstream
country
music
its
author
braden
leap
of
mississippi
state
university
analysed
the
lyrics
of
the
top
songs
on
the
weekly
billboard
country-music
charts
from
the
s
until
the
s
and
found
that
the
near-routine
depiction
of
men
as
breadwinners
and
stand-up
guys
has
changed
over
the
past
decade
more
songs
objectify
women
and
are
about
hooking
up
mr
leap's
examination
of
lyrics
also
found
that
masculinity
and
whiteness
had
become
more
closely
linked
references
to
blue
eyes
and
blond
hair
for
example
were
almost
completely
absent
in
the
s
in
the

they
featured
in
of
the
chart-topping

country

is
the

powerful
gatekeeper

much
until
recently
nor
are
they
playing
as
many
women
as
before
jada
watson
of
the
university
of
ottawa
recently
found
that
in
a
third
of
country
songs
on
country
radio
were
sung
by
women
in
the
share
was
only
even
the

that
of

a

such
as
charley

darius

and

been

some

a

using

weeks
mr
hughes
the
historian
says
the
fact
that
lil
nas
x
has
had
to
force
his
way
in
is
a
real
commentary
on
country
music's
long-term
racial
politics
which
has
always
had
a
very
uneasy
relationship
with
blackness
