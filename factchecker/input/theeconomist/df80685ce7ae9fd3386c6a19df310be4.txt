the
silver
lining
of
america's
opioid
tragedy
transplants
from
people
killed
by
drug
overdoses
are
soaring
the
opioid
addiction
sweeping
america
is
devastating
it
kills
around
people
annually
far
more
than
the
number
who
die
in
traffic
accidents
or
from
gun
violence
it
has
contributed
to
three
years
of
falling
american
life
expectancy
the
first
such
sustained
fall
since
the
first
world
war
but
there
is
one
small
but
significant
silver
lining
organ
donations
in
one
in
eight
deceased
organ
donors
in
america
died
from
an
overdose
compared
to
one
in
in
fatal
drug
overdoses
usually
kill
by
starving
the
brain
of
oxygen
as
far
as
organ
donation
is
concerned
brain
death
is
the
more
useful
kind
that
is
because
it
takes
some
time
for
the
heart
to
register
the
loss
of
brain
function
and
stop
beating
at
which
point
organs
begin
to
deteriorate
rapidly
moreover
the
opioid
epidemic
has
been
concentrated
among
younger
middle-class
people
who
are
in
otherwise
good
overall
health
these
are
extremely
high-quality
organs
says
dorry
segev
a
transplant
surgeon
at
the
johns
hopkins
school
of
medicine
in
baltimore
yet
until
recently
they
were
often
discarded
for
fear
of
blood-borne
diseases
many
of
the
people
who
die
from
a
heroin
overdose
have
at
some
point
shared
needles
with
other
users
that
spreads
viruses
the
most
common
is
hepatitis
c
which
leads
to
liver
disease
but
there
is
also
a
risk
of
hiv
at
some
transplants
centres
now
as
many
as
half
of
transplanted
organs
are
from
such
infectious-risk
donors
as
they
are
called
in
medical
circles
that
luckily
is
becoming
less
of
a
problem
thanks
to
new
technology
it
is
easier
to
know
whether
a
donor
was
infected
with
a
disease
in
the
past
tests
were
not
sensitive
enough
to
pick
up
hiv
or
hepatitis
c
if
the
infection
had
been
acquired
in
the
previous
six
months
or
so
the
testing
methods
used
today
may
miss
only
infections
picked
up
in
the
previous
week
and
if
they
were
infected
it
matters
less
too
in
recent
years
medicines
for
hepatitis
c
have
improved
to
the
point
where
almost
everyone
is
cured
completely
as
a
result
more
patients
agree
to
transplants
from
donors
who
they
know
are
infected
last
year
they
included
robert
montgomery
a
transplant
surgeon
at
the
new
york
university
langone
medical
centre
who
got
a
heart
transplant
from
a
donor
who
he
knew
had
hepatitis
c.
dr
montgomery
became
infected
and
then
cured
of
the
virus
a
study
of
more
than
people
on
the
kidney
waiting
list
in
found
that
five
years
afterwards
those
who
accepted
such
organs
were
on
average
more
likely
to
have
survived
than
those
who
declined
the
low
chance
that
a
better
offer
would
come
along
meant
that
taking
the
risk
was
worth
it
a
study
published
on
april
rd
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
adds
to
growing
evidence
that
such
transplants
are
indeed
safe
in
that
study
people
got
hearts
or
lungs
from
donors
with
hepatitis
c
and
a
four-week
course
of
antiviral
drugs
for
it
six
months
later
all
these
patients
were
clear
of
the
virus
and
they
were
doing
as
well
as
the
patients
in
a
comparison
group
who
had
transplants
from
donors
without
hepatitis
c.
other
studies
have
shown
similar
results
for
kidney
and
liver
transplants
although
they
have
also
been
small
and
with
short
follow-up
periods
all
this
is
good
news
for
the
americans
who
die
on
the
waiting
list
for
transplants
each
year
as
well
as
for
the
who
are
currently
on
the
list
most
of
whom
will
not
get
lucky
this
year
see

and
for
some
of
the
families
bereaved
by
the
opioids
tragedy
the
possibility
that
their
loved
ones
may
give
a
new
lease
of
life
to
others
may
be
a
flicker
of
light
