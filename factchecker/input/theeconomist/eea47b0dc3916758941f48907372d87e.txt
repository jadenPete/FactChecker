the
idea
of
reparations
for
slavery
is
morally
appealing
but
flawed
democrats
should
drop
it
mitch
mcconnell
is
not
known
for
his
views
on
racial
justice
but
when
asked
last
week
whether
he
thought
african-americans
should
receive
restitution
for
slavery
and
the
decades
of
lawful
discrimination
that
followed
it
the
republican
senate
leader's
response
was
sound
he
was
against
the
idea
he
said
in
part
for
practical
reasons
for
how
would
the
recipients
of
compensation
be
selected
he
also
objected
in
principle
if
african-americans
received
reparations
what
about
the
other
victims
of
discrimination
including
america's
many
waves
of
immigrants
continued
incremental
improvements
in
the
lives
of
black
americans
seemed
a
more
credible
response
to
our
original
sin
said
mr
mcconnell
we've
elected
an
african-american
president
i
think
we're
always
a
work
in
progress
in
this
country
democrats
who
were
about
to
hold
the
first
congressional
hearing
on
slavery
reparations
in
over
a
decade
hit
the
roof
senator
cory
booker
one
of
at
least
seven
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
to
have
given
their
support
for
a
bill
to
launch
a
congressional
probe
into
the
issue
slammed
mr
mcconnell's
ignorance
another
candidate
marianne
williamson
a
self-help
guru
who
has
proposed
making
reparations
to
african-americans
of
up
to
half
a
trillion
dollars
questioned
his
gradualist
view
of
racial
progress
you
can't
have
the
future
that
you
want
until
you're
willing
to
clean
up
your
past
yet
mr
mcconnell's
view
of
the
matter
was
similar
to
that
of
the
first
black
president
he
referred
to
barack
obama
considered
the
idea
of
reparations
to
be
politically
fantastical
because
a
majority
of
americans
would
never
agree
to
it
and
otherwise
flawed
that
was
not
to
downplay
the
terrible
legacy
of
slavery
and
jim
crow
among
black
americans
including
persistent
white-black
wealth
income
and
education
gaps
but
as
a
policy
prescription
mr
obama
told
the
writer
ta-nehisi
coates
whose
essay
in
favour
of
reparations
published
in
the
atlantic
had
revived
the
issue
it
was
a
distraction
why
are
we
even
having
the
abstract
conversation
when
we've
got
a
big
fight
on
our
hands
just
to
get
strong
universal
anti-poverty
programmes
and
social
programmes
in
place
and
we're
still
fighting
to
make
sure
that
basic
anti-discrimination
laws
are
enforced
this
also
represented
a
belief
in
the
hard
slog
of
incremental
improvement
ingrained
in
mr
obama
by
his
study
of
history
as
well
as
by
the
political
moment
the
new
deal
and
civil-rights
era
were
rare
explosions
of
liberal
progress
in
special
circumstances
which
his
election
alone
did
not
augur
that
many
democrats
are
nonetheless
now
embracing
the
reparations
distraction
shows
how
much
the
party
has
changed
since
mr
obama
last
secured
the
white
house
in
that
should
worry
anyone
who
hopes
it
will
repeat
the
feat
against
president
donald
trump
next
year
the
right's
racially
charged
opposition
to
mr
obama
has
helped
encourage
the
shift
blowhards
such
as
rush
limbaugh
and
glenn
beck
characterised
his
spending
proposals
as
reparations
congressional
republicans
led
by
mr
mcconnell
obstructed
him
to
an
unprecedented
degree
left-wing
critics
of
mr
obama
including
black
activists
dismayed
by
his
pragmatism
had
previously
warned
that
his
attempts
to
meet
republicans
in
the
centre
ground
would
cause
them
to
shift
it
to
the
right
the
fact
that
this
happened
when
mr
obama
adopted
a
republican
health-care
plan
republicans
called
it
socialism
is
a
reason
many
now
cite
for
demanding
a
bolder
agenda
yet
the
idea
that
mr
obama
would
have
been
more
successful
if
he
had
tried
to
do
the
left-wing
things
his
critics
falsely
accused
him
of
defies
reason
in
the
case
of
reparations
this
would
mean
democrats
propounding
an
idea
even
more
unpopular
than
mr
trump's
policy
of
tearing
migrant
children
from
their
parents
over
of
whites
oppose
it
republicans
are
liable
to
dismiss
any
democratic
racial-justice
scheme
as
identity
politics
in
this
case
they
would
be
right
mr
coates
who
appeared
alongside
mr
booker
at
the
recent
congressional
hearing
argues
that
black
americans
legacy
of
injustice
is
incomparably
worse
than
that
of
any
other
group
yet
native
americans
a
smaller
and
less
democratic
group
would
beg
to
differ
and
though
some
democrats
propose
giving
them
reparations
too
last
week
california's
governor
gavin
newsom
announced
the
launch
of
a
commission
to
study
the
issue
and
elizabeth
warren
has
said
she
might
support
it
that
is
less
a
solution
than
a
warning
against
embarking
on
the
endeavour
at
all
it
would
be
liable
to
keep
spreading
maybe
to
poor
hispanics
next
that
such
a
clearly
impractical
and
politically
no-win
scheme
made
it
through
the
democratic
policy
machine
might
seem
amazing
but
it
did
not
it
flew
more
or
less
straight
from
mr
coates's
pen
to
congress
and
the
presidential
primary
where
ms
williamson
added
noughts
to
it
no
think-tank
or
policy
unit
appears
to
have
given
real
thought
to
slavery
reparations
its
sudden
prominence
reflects
a
lack
of
rigour
characteristic
of
the
party's
activist
fringe
the
green
new
deal
and
medicare-for-all
two
other
fashionable
ideas
on
the
left
received
similarly
scant
consideration
before
being
pushed
by
activists
into
the
mainstream
in
their
defence
democratic
candidates
have
mostly
made
far
more
measured
commitments
to
all
three
ideas
than
the
activists
would
like
asked
for
his
reparations
policy
mr
booker
points
to
his
proposal
to
fight
wealth
inequality
by
giving
cash
in
the
form
of
baby
bonds
to
poor
families
that
is
the
sort
of
colour-blind
anti-poverty
measure
which
would
have
benefited
african-americans
disproportionately
and
which
mr
obama
would
have
approved
of
mr
booker
should
describe
it
as
such
by
flirting
with
reparations
the
democrats
have
already
provided
mr
trump
with
racially
incendiary
attack
lines
and
to
what
end
the
issue
is
not
even
all
that
popular
with
african-americans
only
a
small
majority
of
whom
support
it
they
tend
to
be
as
pragmatic
as
mr
obama
was
and
so
must
know
that
it
is
a
pipe-dream
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
