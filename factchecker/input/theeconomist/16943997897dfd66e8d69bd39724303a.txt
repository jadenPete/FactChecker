california
was
the
first
state
to
allow
sales
of
medical
cannabis
in
and
harborside
one
of
the
first
shops
in
america
to
sell
pot
legally
since
january
last
year
the
firm
has
also
been
able
to
sell
pot
for
purely
recreational
purposes
thanks
to
its
large
number
of
medical
users
california's
is
the
largest
legal
cannabis
market
in
the
world
but
since
the
legalisation
of
adult
sales
that
market
has
been
shrinking
allowing
legal
sales
is
supposed
to
increase
the
size
of
the
market
as
they
force
illicit
sellers
out
of
business
that
is
the
way
it
has
happened
in
other
states
where
cannabis
is
legal
but
according
to
bds
analytics
and
arcview
market
research
legal
sales
in
california
were

in
down
from

in
josh
drayton
spokesman
for
the
california
cannabis
industry
association
says
that
the
state
has
gone
from
being
the
most
loosely
regulated
market
in
the
world
to
one
of
the
most
tightly
regulated
moreover
he
says
the
regulations
go
above
and
beyond
those
for
other
products
bringing
a
messy
market
under
control
is
likened
by
many
in
the
industry
to
putting
the
toothpaste
back
in
the
tube
many
firms
operating
in
the
medical
market
find
the
new
regulations
challenging
and
the
fees
to
get
permits
and
licences
too
expensive
on
top
of
regulations
come
taxes
in
great
abundance
there
is
a
retail
excise
tax
of
in
addition
to
a
sales
tax
that
starts
at
rising
according
to
the
levels
set
by
county
and
city
governments
taxes
on
cultivation
are
many
and
inventive
too
on
top
of
this
federal
taxes
must
still
be
paid
even
though
the
product
remains
illegal
under
federal
law
the
federal
government
declines
to
allow
firms
to
make
deductions
for
running
costs
cannabis
firms
are
thus
taxed
on
gross
profits
the
upshot
is
that
legal
weed
is
expensive
andrew
berman
boss
of
harborside
says
your
correspondent
should
she
want
to
could
get
an
ounce
of
cannabis
delivered
outside
his
store
for
in
his
shop
the
same
product
legally
bought
would
cost
these
factors
go
a
long
way
to
explaining
california's
incredible
shrinking
legal
cannabis
market
another
hindrance
is
that
most
cities
across
the
state
have
decided
initially
not
to
allow
recreational
sales
some
cities
like
los
angeles
have
allowed
shops
but
have
been
slow
to
issue
licences
other
states
planning
to
legalise
cannabis
seem
likely
to
learn
from
this
experience
in
june
illinois
became
the
th
state
to
legalise
recreational
use
the
law
comes
into
effect
at
the
start
of
despite
the
problems
in
the
country's
largest
legal
cannabis
market
pot
continues
to
gain
acceptance
around
the
country
lisa
hurwitz
of
grassroots
cannabis
a
retailer
says
purchases
are
increasing
fastest
among
the
boomer-and-older
generations
they
are
either
rediscovering
it
or
using
it
for
a
variety
of
ailments
that
they
face
in
older
age
she
says
the
plant
she
says
is
useful
for
everything
from
pain
to
poor
sleep
to
anxiety
it
seems
that
cannabis
is
moving
from
the
black
market
to
the
grey
