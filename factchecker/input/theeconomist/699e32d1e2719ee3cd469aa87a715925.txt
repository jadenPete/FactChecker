alaska's
changing
climate
this
year
alaska
has
seen
record
temperatures
up
to
degrees
celsius
above
normal
around
a
recent
backyard
bonfire
on
the
outskirts
of
this
small
fishing
and
tourism
town
in
the
south-central
part
of
alaska
local
residents
debated
whether
a
massive
release
of
spruce
pollen
which
accumulated
on
every
surface
including
car
bonnets
picnic
tables
and
the
nearby
kachemak
bay
amounted
to
a
golden
sheen
or
a
yellow
scum
the
fine
dust
turned
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
colour
of
butter
and
left
a
bright
lemony
line
on
shore
that
marked
the
extent
of
high
tide
and
gave
off
a
sickly
sweet
smell
eric
clarke
manages
trails
at
the
nearby
kachemak
bay
state
park
a
rugged
coastal
area
of
dense
spruce
forests
he
has
been
with
the
park
for
years
i
haven't
seen
a
pollen
dump
like
this
in
years
he
said
this
huge
release
of
pollen
might
be
yet
another
symptom
of
a
rapidly
changing
environment
spruce
pollen
is
made
up
of
microscopic
double-lobed
orbs
that
look
a
bit
like
mickey
mouse
heads
the
ears
are
minute
air
sacks
that
help
the
pollen
grains
disperse
over
hundreds
of
miles
which
in
this
region
of
alaska
means
across
mountains
glaciers
and
bays
spruce
trees
release
pollen
annually
but
every
three
to
five
years
there
is
a
natural
bump
in
pollen
production
this
cyclical
process
is
called
masting
and
it
flushes
the
forests
every
few
years
with
spruce
seeds
overwhelming
seed-eating
animals
like
red
squirrels
and
white-winged
crossbills
and
thereby
ensuring
many
uneaten
seeds
go
on
to
germinate
climate
change
is
also
affecting
how
trees
and
other
plants
release
pollen
rising
temperatures
and
increasing
atmospheric
carbon-dioxide
concentrations
are
intensifying
pollen
seasons
much
to
the
chagrin
of
allergy
sufferers
in
alaska
where
temperatures
are
warming
at
twice
the
national
average
the
change
is
getting
up
people's
noses
increased
carbon
dioxide
will
drive
pollen
levels
says
jeffrey
demain
of
the
allergy
asthma
and
immunology
centre
of
alaska
who
began
pollen
counts
here
nearly
years
ago
his
clinic
treats
patients
with
especially
pernicious
pollen-related
symptoms
more
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
spurs
plant
growth
the
pollen
season
is
extending
as
well
trees
release
pollen
in
the
spring
after
a
short
stretch
of
frost-free
days
because
the
last
frosts
of
spring
are
occurring
earlier
in
the
year
trees
are
blasting
out
pollen
earlier
as
well
and
because
warming
temperatures
are
keeping
autumn
frosts
at
bay
later
into
the
year
plants
continue
to
release
pollen
for
weeks
longer
than
in
years
past
and
in
alaska
where
trees
are
moving
north
into
formerly
treeless
landscapes
the
geographic
reach
of
pollen
is
changing
already
this
year
alaska
has
seen
record
temperatures
more
than
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
above
normal
and
each
year
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
increase
while
spruce
pollen
is
irritating
to
local
residents
the
massive
pollen
release
could
be
a
boon
to
the
region's
forests
which
have
been
decimated
in
recent
years
by
beetle
and
aphid
infestations
brought
on
by
rising
temperatures
the
yellow
mist
rising
from
the
trees
looks
like
an
indicator
of
a
rapidly
changing
environment
which
is
leaving
its
mark
on
human
health
local
forests
and
the
tideline
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
