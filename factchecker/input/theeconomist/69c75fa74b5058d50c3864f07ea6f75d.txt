when
lincoln

a
church
in
the
shaw
neighbourhood
of
washington
dc
closed
this
year
it
signalled
the
end
of
an
important
chapter
in
african-american
history
founded
in
by
a
group
that
included
many
newly
freed
slaves
it
became
a
hub
of
the

shaw
has
lost
around
of
its
churches
most
of
them
with
predominantly
black
congregations
since
in
capitol
hill
it
reckons
over
of
religious
properties
have
closed
one
of
the
reasons
behind
the
disappearance
of
washington's
churches
is
familiar
across
the
west
fewer
people
are
going
to
church
but
as
in
other
big
cities
that
change
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
departure
of
african-americans
to
the
suburbs
what
began
in
part
as
a
search
for
more
space
and
a
better
life
has
been
accelerated
by
gentrification
in
the
proportion
of
black
residents
in
washington
dropped
below
of
the
population
for
the
first
time
in
decades
many
of
those
who
left
took
their
religion
with
them
as
the
mushrooming
of
churches
in
some
maryland
suburbs
shows
some
tried
not
to
jeanne
cooper
who
attended
lincoln
temple
for
five
decades
says
many
congregants
would
drive
in
from
the
suburbs
on
sunday
she
did
so
herself
until
the
church's
last
service
but
as
parking
spaces
were
swallowed
up
by
development
or
claimed
by
new
residents
who
had
lobbied
the
city
for
parking
restrictions
the
journey
became
too
much
for
many
of
its
ageing
members
elsewhere
in
washington
old
churches
have
been
flattened

developed

blocks
shaw
where
victorian
row
houses
sit
alongside
renovated
industrial
lofts
has
become
one
of
the
city's
trendiest
neighbourhoods
demand
for
land
is
high
but
mrs
cooper
says
the
church's
management
team
which
she
leads
hopes
to
continue
renting
out
the
building
to
groups
that
serve
the
area's
poor
that
way
it
almost
feels
as
if
the
church
is
returning
to
its
original
purpose
she
says
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
