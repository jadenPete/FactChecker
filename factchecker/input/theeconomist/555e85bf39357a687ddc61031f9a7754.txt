philadelphia
politics
are
stuck
in
the
era
of
prog
rock
the
indictment
of
john
dougherty
has
a
strangely
retro
feel
philadelphia's
city
hall
is
an
immense
room
building
even
taller
than
the
capitol
in
washington
dc
a
statue
of
william
penn
the
city's
founder
stands
on
top
of
it
until
no
building
in
the
city
was
higher
than
the
top
of
penn's
hat
high-rises
now
dwarf
the
statue
john
johnny
doc
dougherty
head
of
the
local
electrical
union
has
long
helped
shaped
philadelphia's
politics
as
well
as
its
skyline
how
he
did
so
is
outlined
in
a
page
federal
indictment
containing
counts
of
embezzlement
fraud
and
public
corruption
which
reads
like
a
relic
from
the
mid-
s
i
got
a
different
world
than
most
people
ever
exist
in
i
am
able
to
take
care
of
a
lot
of
people
all
the
time
said
mr
dougherty
in
a
conversation
caught
by
an
fbi
wiretap
the
indictment
alleges
that
he
and
seven
pals
including
a
city
councilman
embezzled
more
than
of
union
money
collected
from
members
dues
to
fund
personal
shopping
sprees
a
security
system
and
dinners
in
new
york
and
atlantic
city
among
other
things
as
well
as
controlling
the
electrical
union
mr
dougherty
is
head
of
the
building
trades
council
which
represents
local
unions
if
a
construction
site
attempted
to
use
non-union
workers
he
ordered
a
giant
inflatable
rat
to
be
put
outside
he
funnelled
millions
of
dollars
to
help
democrats
his
support
helped
two
mayors
win
elections
including
the
incumbent
jim
kenney
his
brother
kevin
dougherty
won
a
state
supreme
court
seat
with
union
help
then
helped
strike
down
the
state's
congressional
map
for
being
unconstitutionally
gerrymandered
donating
to
campaigns
boosting
candidates
and
supporting
policies
are
not
illegal
but
mr
dougherty's
clout
went
further
bobby
henon
who
was
also
indicted
on
january
th
stayed
on
the
union
payroll
even
after
he
was
elected
to
the
city
council
this
is
not
illegal
either
but
the
indictment
alleges
that
he
used
his
position
to
do
mr
dougherty's
bidding
in
philadelphia
became
the
first
big
city
to
impose
a
tax
on
fizzy
drinks
text
messages
between
the
two
men
indicate
that
mr
henon's
position
was
part
of
a
vendetta
against
the
teamsters
union
which
feared
the
loss
of
delivery
jobs
according
to
the
indictment
mr
dougherty
said
to
a
union
official
let
me
tell
you
what
bobby
henon's
going
to
do
put
a
tax
on
soda
again
and
that
will
cost
the
teamsters
jobs
in
philly
the
lowest
point
in
the
indictment
describes
mr
dougherty
allegedly
strong-arming
a
children's
hospital
because
the
manufacturer
of
an
mri
machine
required
its
own
non-union
workers
to
install
it
mr
dougherty
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
charges
it
is
a
municipal
election
year
and
politicians
still
need
his
money
and
his
members
to
get
out
the
vote
they
also
suspect
he
is
vengeful
according
to
the
fbi
mr
dougherty
once
got
mr
henon
to
investigate
a
towing
company
that
seized
his
car
he
remains
head
of
his
union
still
if
he
is
convicted
that
would
shake
up
the
democratic
party's
wheezing
political
machine
says
david
thornburgh
of
the
committee
of
seventy
a
government
watchdog
in
any
case
he
may
be
philadelphia's
last
powerful
local
union
leader
the
national
ironworkers
union
has
already
taken
control
after
its
local
leaders
ordered
a
quaker
meeting
house
built
by
non-union
workers
to
be
torched
the
national
carpenters
union
also
kicked
out
the
city's
union
leader
who
had
led
the
local
branch
since
mr
dougherty
has
damaged
the
local's
reputation
members
may
have
difficulty
securing
work
and
contracts
who's
the
rat
now
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
