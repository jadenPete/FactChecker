tv
format
for
politics
braddock
needed
a
mayor
so
it
held
an
audition
the
casting
call
went
out
last
month
braddock
a
small
steel
town
ten
miles
from
pittsburgh
needed
a
new
mayor
john
fetterman
who
had
held
the
post
for
years
had
stepped
down
to
become
pennsylvania's
lieutenant-governor
interested
candidates
had
five
minutes
each
to
wow
the
borough
council
in
a
special
public
session
and
convince
them
that
they
should
be
the
next
mayor
only
five
applicants
who
included
a
former
chef
and
a
wig-seller
auditioned
on
january
th
chardae
jones
a
year-old
business
analyst
sporting
pink
dreads
was
the
unanimous
winner
the
town
does
not
usually
hold
open
auditions
for
vacant
political
posts
its
council
has
the
power
to
appoint
an
interim
mayor
but
an
attempt
to
do
this
last
month
derailed
when
questions
emerged
about
the
eligibility
of
the
chosen
candidates
and
the
vetting
process
so
the
council
decided
to
open
the
contest
to
any
resident
of
the
borough
who
is
registered
to
vote
and
has
not
been
convicted
of
a
felony
braddock
has
struggled
for
generations
the
hardscrabble
town
where
andrew
carnegie
opened
his
first
steel
mill
and
first
carnegie
library
is
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
at
its
height
in
the
s
the
population
exceeded
today
it
is
less
than
braddock
avenue
the
main
commercial
artery
once
had
bustling
shops
hotels
and
restaurants
today
it
is
a
parade
of
empty
lots
and
closed
storefronts
braddock's
mayor
has
few
powers
the
borough
has
been
under
state
financial
oversight
since
the
council
not
the
mayor
operates
the
budget
and
hires
borough
employees
the
mayor
has
public-safety
responsibilities
but
the
police
department
is
only
part-time
and
its
budget
is
tight
the
outgoing
mayor
mr
fetterman
a
graduate
of
harvard
kennedy
school
of
government
did
much
to
shine
a
spotlight
on
braddock
including
giving
ted
talks
appearing
on
the
colbert
report
a
comedy
news
programme
and
hustling
to
attract
businesses
and
investors
when
he
became
mayor
in
the
town
didn't
even
have
an
atm
he
went
on
national
television
to
beg
subway
a
restaurant
chain
to
open
new
restaurants
eventually
came
though
still
no
subway
but
braddock's
renaissance
is
still
some
way
off
carnegie's
mill
miraculously
is
still
in
operation
its
chimneys
dominate
the
skyline
but
not
the
city's
economy
it
employs
only
of
the
workers
it
once
did
and
few
of
them
live
in
braddock
the
victor
of
braddock's
talent
contest
ms
jones
intends
to
continue
much
of
mr
fetterman's
promotion
but
warns
that
redevelopment
means
nothing
if
the
community
is
not
safe
she
will
have
to
audition
again
to
keep
her
new
job
she
faces
a
primary
and
then
a
more
conventional
election
in
november
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
