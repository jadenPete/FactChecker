appeals
sexual-orientation
bias
the
judges
held
is
a
subset
of
sex
discrimination
because
it
is
based
on
notions
about
how
persons
of
a
certain
sex
can
or
should
be
mr
bostock's
similar
contention
was
rejected

wrote
to

her
boss
explaining
that
she
planned
to
transition
and
would
present
herself
as
a

at
work
two
weeks
later
mr
rost
fired
ms
stephens
failing
to
wear
the
suit
and

required
of
male

presenting
as
a

would

a
negative
impact
on
his

healing

mr

lawyers
say
and
the
original
public
meaning
of
sex
discrimination
when
congress
wrote
title
vii
in

not
require
transgender
people
to
be
treated

a

panel
of
the
sixth

court
of
appeals
disagreed
mr
rost
illegally
discriminated
against
ms
stephens
the
panel
held
unanimously
by
treating
her
differently
from
how
he
would
have
treated
a
female
employee
and
by
requiring
her
to
conform
to
male
stereotypes
the
trump
administration
has
taken
the
employers
side
in
the
title
vii
cases
contrary
to
the
view
of
another

of

the

whether
a

agent
can
be
sued
for
shooting

killing
a

across

the
justices
will
also
sort
out
a
two-year-long
fight
over
donald

a

case
involving
a
gun
regulation
in
new
york
city
is
scheduled
for
argument
on
december
nd
but
after
the
supreme
court
said
it
would
review
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
which
prohibits
new
york
city
residents
with
firearms
licences
from
taking
their
guns
to
the
suburbs
the
rule
was
rescinded
the
plaintiffs
anxious
to
fortify
the
individual
right
to
bear
arms
have
implored
the
supreme
court
to
keep
the
case
on
its
docket
but
new
york
says
there
is
no
ongoing
injury
to
the
aggrieved
gun
owners
and
no
controversy
left
to
adjudicate
on
october
st
when
the
justices
meet
privately
to
review
reams
of
petitions
that
have
piled
up
over
the
summer
they
will
discuss
whether
to
scrap

carry

other

to
hear
include

privacy
row
in
kansas
fallout
from
the
bridgegate
scandal
in
new
jersey
and
a

several
budding
petitions
could
make
headlines
too
an
immigration
case
that
stephen
vladeck
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
texas
says
may
have
sweeping
ramifications
asks
if
undocumented
immigrants
on
american
soil
have
a
constitutional
right
to
judicial
review
when
being
detained
or
deported
a
case
involving
louisiana
abortion-clinic
regulations
nearly
identical
to
rules
the
court
struck
down
as
an
undue
burden
in
gives
the
new
conservative
bloc
a
first
swipe
at
pushing
back
abortion
rights
according
to
kate
shaw
a
professor
at
cardozo
law
school
it
seems
almost
certain
that
the
limits
of
presidential
power
will
soon
be
another
point
of
contention
likely
subjects
include
the
president's
push
for
the
power
to
remove
the
director
of
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
executive
privilege
in
battles
over
tax
returns
a
crackdown
on
asylum
emergency
funding
for
a
border
wall
and
the
president's
ability
to
block
critics
on
twitter
in
april
mr
trump
tweeted
that
if
the
partisan
dems
ever
tried
to
impeach
he
would
first
head
to
the
us
supreme
court
by
narrow
votes
the
justices
have
backed
several
of
the
president's
controversial
moves
but
mr
trump
should
not
expect
them
to
come
to
his
rescue
during
impending
impeachment
proceedings
in
chief
justice
william
rehnquist
wrote
for
a
unanimous
court
that
impeachment
authority
is
reposed
in
congress
and
nowhere
else
still
if
the
house
of
representatives
winds
up
impeaching
mr
trump
the
politics-shy
chief
justice
john
roberts
will
find
himself
playing
a
constitutionally
required
role
he
is
unlikely
to
relish
presiding
over
the
president's
removal
trial
in
the
united
states
senate
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's

slowdown
shows
no
sign
of

to
expect
