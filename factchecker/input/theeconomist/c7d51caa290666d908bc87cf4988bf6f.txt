republicans
may
learn
to
love
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
if
democrats
ever
embraced
socialism
america
would
probably
stay
conservative
the
choice
isn't
what
i'm
breathing
in
the
choice
is
what
i'm
exhaling
said
representative
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
at
a
celebration
of
martin
luther
king
day
in
the
riverside
church
in
manhattan
this
week
and
i
think
that
the
situation
right
now
with
this
administration
with
the
abdication
of
responsibility
by
so
many
powerful
people
even
people
who
abdicate
that
responsibility
by
calling
themselves
liberal
or
democratic
i
feel
a
need
for
all
of
us
to
breathe
fire
the
year-old
congresswoman's
many
critics
on
the
right
are
more
concerned
by
what
they
think
ms
ocasio-cortez
may
be
smoking
since
her
demolition
of
joe
crowley
a
moderate
democratic
leader
last
year
in
a
primary
bid
for
his
safe
bronx-queens
district
she
has
become
a
hate-figure
of
seemingly
limitless
interest
to
conservative
media
outlets
fox
news
debuts
premium
channel
for
hour
coverage
of
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
snarked
the
onion
exaggerating
only
slightly
her
rare
combination
of
success
and
hard-left
views
is
the
ostensible
reason
in
the
mould
of
her
fellow
democratic
socialist
bernie
sanders
on
whose
presidential
campaign
she
worked
she
is
for
universal
medicare
a
federal
job
guarantee
making
tertiary
education
free
and
forgiving
college
debt
yet
a
relentless
focus
on
ms
ocasio-cortez's
appearance
person
and
spirited
behaviour
suggests
the
vituperation
is
fuelled
by
darker
forces
than
policy
disagreement
this
makes
the
activist
left
including
many
at
the
riverside
a
stage
for
civil-rights
leaders
including
martin
luther
king
through
the
ages
love
her
all
the
more
they
also
love
the
fire-breathing
rhetoric
she
showed
off
in
an
on-stage
chat
with
the
author
ta-nehisi
coates
best
of
all
they
love
her
ability
to
sock
it
to
her
right-wing
detractors
typically
for
the
benefit
of
her
m
twitter
followers
don't
hate
me
cause
you
ain't
me
fellas
she
tweeted
to
house
republicans
after
they
booed
her
vote
for
nancy
pelosi
as
speaker
that
incident
also
exemplified
the
only
way
that
ms
ocasio-cortez
may
actually
matter
the
right-wing
hate-craze
for
her
is
fuelled
by
a
fear
that
she
could
be
about
to
turn
america
socialist
that
rather
under-rates
the
fact
that
freshmen
house
members
have
a
long
way
to
rise
that
most
of
the
new
intake
of
democrats
are
moderate
and
many
have
had
enough
of
her
attention-grabbing
and
that
if
their
party
ever
did
nominate
a
democratic
socialist
for
president
she
would
be
much
likelier
to
keep
america
conservative
by
far
the
biggest
threat
ms
ocasio-cortez
represents
is
to
her
own
party
republicans
ought
really
to
love
her
for
that
the
hard-left
activist
world
she
springs
from
mainly
exists
to
shunt
democrats
to
the
left
there
are
signs
in
the
emerging
democratic
presidential
primary
that
it
is
succeeding
all
three
of
the
senators
who
have
so
far
declared
their
candidacies
kirsten
gillibrand
kamala
harris
and
elizabeth
warren
support
medicare-for-all
an
idea
that
also
sprang
from
mr
sanders's
campaign
and
ms
harris
and
mrs
warren
have
endorsed
the
concept
of
ms
ocasio-cortez's
signature
proposal
the
green
new
deal
a
suite
of
policies
to
address
both
climate
change
and
inequality
yet
ms
ocasio-cortez
wants
to
cause
a
much
bigger
shakeup
on
the
left
as
her
on-stage
reference
to
colleagues
ducking
their
moral
responsibility
suggested
she
celebrated
her
election
last
november
by
backing
a
campaign
by
justice
democrats
an
activist
group
founded
by
her
chief-of-staff
and
fellow
sanders
alumnus
saikat
chakrabarti
to
unseat
democratic
incumbents
deemed
insufficiently
left-wing
she
has
since
tried
to
make
nice
with
the
democratic
leadership
as
her
vote
for
mrs
pelosi
illustrated
i
do
see
my
situation
evolving
i
take
my
oath
of
office
very
seriously
she
said
at
the
riverside
i
was
giving
myself
a
little
more
permission
to
be
a
little
more
out-of-pocket
before
my
swearing
in
yet
keeping
ms
ocasio-cortez
sweet
will
be
an
important
task
for
mrs
pelosi
who
has
three
decades
more
congressional
experience
but
half
a
million
fewer
twitter
followers
the
veteran
speaker
has
made
a
decent
start
but
given
that
aoc
as
the
congresswoman
is
known
appears
to
have
no
interest
in
leadership
positions
or
other
plums
within
mrs
pelosi's
gift
she
will
have
to
work
harder
indeed
the
real
challenge
of
ms
ocasio-cortez's
populist
ideas
to
both
parties
but
to
the
democrats
most
urgently
is
the
way
they
expose
the
inadequacy
of
mainstream
policy
responses
to
the
big
problems
including
inequality
and
global
warming
she
describes
on
climate
most
obviously
republicans
have
no
basis
to
call
her
an
extremist
her
diagnosis
of
the
looming
disaster
is
in
line
with
scientific
orthodoxy
theirs
a
corporate-funded
denial
routine
is
the
outlier
democratic
leaders
by
contrast
agree
with
her
diagnosis
of
the
problem
yet
they
are
alarmed
by
the
profligacy
of
her
proposals
which
are
based
on
an
improbable
ambition
to
decarbonise
the
energy
sector
by
their
alarm
is
justified
yet
it
would
carry
more
weight
if
they
had
more
serious
alternatives
to
offer
republican
denial
of
climate
change
has
led
to
democratic
complacency
on
the
issue
this
is
our
world
war
ii
ms
ocasio-cortez
said
at
the
riverside
and
your
biggest
issue
is
how
are
we
going
to
pay
for
it
to
check
her
left-wing
enthusiasm
and
perhaps
save
the
planet
house
democrats
need
a
better
answer
to
that
question
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
