the
benefits
of
america's
hot
economy
have
been
unevenly
spread
unemployment
rates
for
african-americans
have
fallen
farthest
and
fastest
our
economy's
on
fire
says
tamara
atkinson
head
of
austin's
workforce
development
board
workers
there
are
being
fought
over
with
signing
bonuses
paid
internships
and
help
with
tuition
fees
ms
atkinson
sees
formerly
incarcerated
workers
being
given
second
chances
with
employers
asking
how
severe
their
crime
really
was
she
even
worries
that
wages
for
flipping
burgers
are
now
so
high
that
they
are
pulling
people
away
from
education
as
ms
atkinson
heard
the
economy
humming
unemployment
statistics
revealed
a
blip
january's
figures
published
by
the
texas
workforce
commission
on
march
th
revealed
that
austin's
unemployment
rate
had
ticked
up
from
in
december
to
in
january
on
the
same
day
the
bureau
of
labour
statistics
generated
some
sharp
intakes
of
breath
when
it
revealed
that
in
february
the
whole
economy
generated
just
new
jobs
far
below
january's
bumper
haul
of
both
figures
are
probably
statistical
anomalies
austin's
figure
was
not
seasonally
adjusted
and
average
jobs
growth
for
the
country
as
a
whole
over
the
past
three
months
has
been
a
healthy
i
wouldn't
interpret
this
as
the
labour
market
softening
says
betsey
stevenson
of
the
university
of
michigan
the
former
chief
economist
at
the
department
of
labour
rather
than
causing
panic
these
new
numbers
should
be
a
reminder
of
both
the
extraordinary
benefits
of
the
recovery
so
far
and
the
human
cost
if
it
falters
the
particular
benefits
provided
by
a
hot
economy
were
laid
out
by
an
economist
called
arthur
okun
in
he
argued
that
lowering
unemployment
would
generate
benefits
far
beyond
just
creating
jobs
reckoning
that
it
would
raise
a
submerged
iceberg
pulling
people
off
the
sidelines
and
into
work
pushing
part-timers
into
full-time
engagements
and
boosting
productivity
such
would
be
the
power
of
a
vibrant
economy
that
it
would
draw
people
and
resources
towards
where
they
could
be
most
useful
the
experience
of
the
past
decade
has
confirmed
much
of
mr
okun's
thesis
the
nature
of
employment
has
shifted
towards
full-time
jobs
and
fewer
people
are
working
fewer
hours
than
they
would
like
young
women
have
rejoined
the
workforce
with
much
more
enthusiasm
than
men
after
america's
disability
rolls
swelled
during
the
recession
many
feared
that
those
leaving
the
labour
force
would
never
return
those
fears
were
clearly
misguided
says
ernie
tedeschi
an
economist
at
evercore
isi
an
investment
bank
the
share
of
people
aged
saying
that
they
are
out
of
work
because
of
illness
or
disability
was
lower
in
than
it
was
back
in
the
change
has
accounted
for
almost
half
of
the
increase
in
labour-force
participation
over
the
past
year
a
new
study
presented
at
the
brookings
institution
almost
years
later
tests
mr
okun's
thesis
with
data
from
the
most
recent
recovery
it
finds
that
the
higher
the
unemployment
rate
is
for
any
particular
group
the
more
sensitive
that
group
will
be
to
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
economy
african-americans
for
example
tend
to
have
higher
unemployment
rates
than
whites
and
they
suffered
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
job
losses
during
the
recession
see
chart
notwithstanding
a
recent
wobble
they
have
since
enjoyed
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
gains
groups
with
lower
levels
of
education
find
themselves
in
a
similar
situation
as
they
too
suffered
a
harder
blow
than
most
during
the
recession
and
more
recently
have
enjoyed
a
faster
fall
in
their
unemployment
rate
for
the
likes
of
ms
atkinson
who
worries
about
the
people
flipping
burgers
to
pay
their
rent
these
basic
measures
of
success
are
not
good
enough
if
a
hot
economy
pulls
people
into
dead-end
jobs
then
they
will
fall
right
back
out
of
them
when
the
next
recession
strikes
the
evidence
on
this
from
austin
is
mixed
according
to
indeed
com
an
online
jobs
platform
local
searches
for
jobs
such
as
shop
assistant
warehouse
worker
and
waitress
rose
by
more
than
between
the
end
of
and
the
end
of
but
searches
for
learning
and
development
opportunities
rose
even
more
quickly
nationwide
mr
tedeschi
is
not
worried
pointing
out
that
the
share
of
people
who
say
that
they
are
out
of
work
because
they
are
in
education
is
higher
than
it
was
in
and
has
persistently
been
so
it
is
possible
that
as
wage
growth
puts
pressure
on
companies
profit
margins
they
will
respond
by
investing
in
productivity-boosting
measures
in
line
with
mr
okun's
third
prediction

they

about

another

by
julie
hotchkiss
of

bank
of
atlanta
and
robert
moore
of

found
that
the
benefits
to

from
hot

have
tended
to
be
smaller
than
their
penalties
in
colder
times
it's
not
a
matter
of
if
there's
going
to
be
another
recession
warns
ms
atkinson
it's
a
matter
of
when
if
february's
jobs
numbers
turn
out
to
be
more
than
a
hiccup
then
those
who
have
