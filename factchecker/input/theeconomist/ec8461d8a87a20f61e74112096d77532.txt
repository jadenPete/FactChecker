bars
are
coming
to
a
city
near
you
hold
still
you
can
change
someone's
life
with
a
bit
of
lip

dr
alexander
blinski
the
co-founder
and
chief
medical
officer
of
plump
cosmetics
and
injectables
a
beauty
salon
in
new
york
his
practice
which
feels
more
like
a
cross
between
a
cupcake
shop
and
a
soulcycle
studio
than
a
place
where
people
willingly
go
to
let
needles
full
of
neurotoxins
gently
paralyse
the
muscles
in
their
faces
is
one
of
a
growing
number
of
establishments
in
america
aimed
at
making
injectable
cosmetic
treatments
seem
less
clinical
west
coast
lips
are
a
favourite
with
more
volume
than
east
coast
lips
they
are
fuller
and
appear
more
enhanced
than
the
subtle
work-with-what-you've-got
plump
of
their
east-coast
cousin
which
is
more
rosebud
than
rhododendron
instaready
cheeks
are
another
popular
treatment
among
those
who
want
a
more
influencer-worthy
contour
to
their
jowls
they
are
achieved
with
a
dose
of
an
injectable
filler
and
cost
just
over
more
modestly
priced
treatments
include
the
goodbye
gummy
smile
which
restrains
the
muscles
in
the
upper
lip
and
is
for
those
who
want
to
flash
more
white
in
their
posts
a
treatment
helps
those
who
wish
to
minimise
their
underarm
sweat
production
in
ways
that
the
humble
antiperspirant
has
yet
to
master
celebrities
like
the
kardashians
bella
hadid
and
the
real
housewives
are
credited
with
the
mainstreaming
of
injectables
which
are
the
most
common
minimally
invasive
cosmetic
procedure
performed
according
to
data
from
the
american
society
of
plastic
surgeons
clients
are
mostly
millennials

of
a
plumper

keen
to
banish
an
angry-looking
furrowed
brow
or
drag
queens
in
search
of
more
dramatic
cheeks
i
liked
that
the
filler
was
natural-looking

didn't
want

a

editor
decided
to
get
a
few
shots
around
his
th
birthday

did
so
because
his
preferred
hairstyle
a
man
bun
gave
him
no
place
to
hide
the
wrinkles
creeping
across
his
forehead
although
nearly
m
of
these
procedures
were
performed
in
america
in

is
reason
to
approach
them
with
prudence
