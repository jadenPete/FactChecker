there
is
a
need
for
fresh
thinking
on
human
rights
but
mike
pompeo's
new
commission
looks
like
a
partisan
stunt
mary
ann
glendon
is
not
used
to
having
her
bona
fides
questioned
the
year-old
harvard
professor
is
an
eminent
legal
scholar
whose
books
on
comparative
law
and
human
rights
are
widely
respected
a
former
ambassador
to
the
holy
see
she
is
also
a
conservative
catholic
whose
opposition
to
gay
marriage
and
abortion
have
drawn
flak
but
her
view
of
abortion
is
nuanced
she
is
not
for
a
blanket
ban
and
her
contribution
to
human
rights
is
significant
she
was
active
in
the
civil-rights
struggle
and
had
a
child
with
an
african-american
in
the
s
her
book
on
the
conservative
and
christian
roots
of
the
rights
movement
is
seminal
yet
since
her
former
student
mike
pompeo
the
secretary
of
state
announced
that
she
will
lead
a
new
commission
on
unalienable
rights
both
she
and
it
have
been
savaged
over
rights
religious
and
academic
bodies
as
well
as
obama
and
bush
administration
officials
such
as
david
kramer
and
susan
rice
signed
a
letter
asking
the
panel
to
be
scrapped
before
it
has
even
met
in
a
lengthy
email
exchange
ms
glendon
sounded
understandably
bruised
i
really
hope
that
those
who
have
rushed
to
judgment
about
the
commission
before
it
gets
off
the
ground
will
one
day
understand
how
far
off
the
mark
they
were
yet
that
does
seem
unlikely
the
opposition
stems
from
a
belief
that
mr
pompeo
launched
the
commission
to
promote
religious
liberty
with
which
evangelical
christians
the
trump
administration's
most
important
constituency
are
obsessed
at
the
expense
of
reproductive
and
gay
rights
which
they
abhor
this
is
a
fair
deduction
religious
liberty
is
the
only
right
in
which
mr
pompeo
who
is
evangelical
and
highly
ambitious
has
shown
any
serious
interest
he
has
also
previously
linked
it
to
the
archaic
phrase
unalienable
right
which
conservatives
use
to
denote
the
rights
to
liberty
and
property
enshrined
in
america's
founding
documents
by
contrast
many
people
seemingly
including
mr
pompeo
view
more
recent
protections
for
gays
and
other
minorities
as
mere
interests
or
goods
doled
out
by
liberals
for
political
gain
ms
glendon
is
also
among
them
she
once
called
gay
marriage
a
demand
for
special
preference
so
are
at
least
some
of
her
fellow
commissioners
they
are
a
mainly
conservative
group
of
academics
and
faith
leaders
few
of
whom
have
any
expertise
in
human
rights
and
as
if
those
were
not
sufficient
grounds
for
scepticism
the
commission
is
viewed
with
suspicion
by
the
state
department's
own
human-rights
division
which
has
had
no
hand
in
it
still
ms
glendon
insists
that
the
pre-emptive
criticism
is
wrong
nowhere
in
our
charge
is
there
anything
about
reprioritising
rights
and
someone
of
her
stature
deserves
a
serious
hearing
in
her
view
there
are
many
reasons
to
reappraise
the
rights
agenda
it
is
widely
recognised
in
the
human-rights
community
that
the
great
post-
human-rights
project
is
in
crisis
she
says
to
underline
that
she
quotes
a
list
of
liberals
including
salil
shetty
a
former
boss
of
amnesty
international
and
samuel
moyn
of
yale
university
who
have
expressed
similar
concerns
one
is
that
governments
are
not
defending
rights
the
erosion
of
the
fragile
consensus
that
once
supported
the
un
declaration
on
human
rights
has
benefited
and
been
exploited
by
the
world's
worst
rights
violators
writes
ms
glendon
like
mr
moyn
she
has
argued
for
recognising
socioeconomic
rights
as
european
countries
do
but
america
does
not
as
well
as
civil
and
political
ones
her
emails
also
touched
on
her
more
controversial
views
pandering
to
special
interests
has
led
rights
groups
to
disavow
established
rights
that
do
not
suit
their
agendas
she
wrote
applied
to
gay
rights
that
is
an
illiberal
view
yet
ms
glendon
can
at
least
cite
more
history
in
support
of
it
than
her
critics
allow
with
their
conservative
christian
roots
the
framers
of
the
un
declaration
did
not
envisage
gay
marriage
conservatives
like
her
therefore
believe
they
are
not
reactionaries
as
liberals
claim
but
rather
keepers
of
the
rights
movement's
true
flame
crisis
may
be
too
strong
a
word
but
ms
glendon
is
right
to
note
the
strain
human
rights
are
under
including
from
authoritarian
leaders
ineffective
international
institutions
and
rights
proliferation
an
administration
that
wanted
to
lead
a
good-faith
review
of
such
worries
could
have
drawn
support
from
across
the
political
spectrum
ms
glendon's
illiberal
views
should
not
disqualify
her
from
leading
such
an
effort
gay
rights
are
a
settled
issue
in
america
and
mr
pompeo
would
struggle
to
restrict
state
department
support
for
them
by
more
than
the
minimal
steps
he
has
already
taken
by
denying
some
embassies
permission
to
fly
flags
to
celebrate
gay
pride
for
example
the
problem
is
that
there
is
not
much
reason
to
think
the
new
commission
is
a
good-faith
effort
even
beyond
mr
pompeo's
evangelical
crowd-pleasing
the
trump
administration
has
shown
little
interest
in
standing
up
to
the
worst
rights-violators
mr
pompeo
only
ever
castigates
abusers
such
as
iran
or
cuba
when
it
is
politically
convenient
mr
trump
appears
to
have
no
interest
in
the
issue
and
the
administration's
attacks
on
international
rights
institutions
look
equally
self-serving
its
argument
for
pulling
out
of
the
un
human
rights
commission
a
troubled
body
that
had
nevertheless
been
improving
under
american
influence
was
bogus
the
administration
has
a
record
of
convening
expert
panels
to
score
political
points
one
was
given
the
impossible
task
of
substantiating
mr
trump's
claim
that
his
election
saw
massive
vote-rigging
another
has
been
proposed
under
one
of
the
few
climate-change
deniers
in
an
ivy
league
science
faculty
on
global
warming
that
ms
glendon's
panel
looks
like
the
latest
example
is
in
a
sense
nothing
unusual
despite
the
lofty
ideals
that
attend
them
rights
claims
are
always
made
and
resisted
as
part
of
broader
political
battles
mr
moyn
calls
them
politics
by
other
means
yet
what
is
depressing
in
this
case
is
how
small
the
politics
seem
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
