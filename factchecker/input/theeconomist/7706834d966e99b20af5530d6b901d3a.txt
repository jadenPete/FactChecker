nemesis
pelosi
the
house
speaker
is
the
best
judge
of
whether
to
impeach
donald
trump
nancy
pelosi
appears
to
be
in
a
somewhat
contradictory
position
in
her
second
stint
as
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
year-old
californian
has
won
plaudits
for
keeping
the
enlarged
democratic
house
caucus
united
passing
over
bills
in
five
months
and
intimidating
donald
trump
as
no
other
politician
has
done
remarkably
given
that
the
republicans
have
spent
a
decade
pinning
her
face
to
a
metaphorical
dartboard
the
president
has
largely
refrained
from
badmouthing
mrs
pelosi
he
is
said
in
private
to
express
admiration
for
her
grip
on
her
party
meanwhile
mrs
pelosi
is
denying
a
growing
minority
of
democratic
lawmakers
and
more
democratic
voters
what
they
most
want
mr
trump's
impeachment
this
balancing
act
is
likely
to
get
harder
after
congress
reconvenes
next
week
ever
since
six
democratic
house
members
drafted
impeachment
proceedings
against
mr
trump
months
ago
mrs
pelosi
has
claimed
to
be
open-minded
on
the
matter
while
manifestly
against
it
a
witness
to
newt
gingrich's
effort
to
oust
bill
clinton
which
led
to
a
wave
of
sympathy
for
the
president
a
boost
in
his
ratings
and
his
acquittal
by
the
senate
she
fears
impeaching
mr
trump
a
politician
whose
entire
modus
is
based
on
grievance
could
have
the
same
effect
it
would
almost
certainly
not
lead
to
his
removal
given
his
own
control
of
his
party
hence
mrs
pelosi
has
offered
a
series
of
reasons
to
avoid
pressing
the
button
after
robert
mueller
refrained
from
accusing
mr
trump
of
the
obstruction
of
justice
that
his
report
describes
simply
because
justice
department
guidelines
forbade
him
to
do
so
the
enigmatic
prosecutor
suggested
on
may
th
mrs
pelosi
said
that
further
house
investigations
were
required
after
the
president
began
defying
the
democrats
subpoenas
and
last
week
promised
to
end
all
bipartisan
co-operation
while
they
continued
their
probes
she
claimed
mr
trump
was
so
obviously
goading
democrats
to
impeach
him
that
they
must
not
take
the
bait
yet
some
house
democrats
have
had
enough
of
this
around
are
committed
to
launching
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
mr
trump
the
preliminary
step
to
impeachment
as
an
indication
of
which
way
the
party
is
moving
around
half
of
the
democrats
sitting
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
which
has
borne
the
brunt
of
mr
trump's
obstruction
are
among
them
including
a
senior
pelosi
lieutenant
david
cicilline
pro-impeachment
groups
such
as
stand
up
america
which
has
recruited
over
m
members
in
the
past
two
years
are
planning
a
media
blitz
in
democratic
districts
at
a
town-hall
meeting
in
michigan
this
week
justin
amash
a
republican
congressman
gave
them
additional
encouragement
by
arguing
that
mr
trump's
incredible
dishonesty
made
impeachment
necessary
i
think
you
have
to
have
proceedings
to
deter
this
kind
of
conduct
he
said
before
a
crowd
of
outraged
republicans
and
grateful
democrats
in
a
state
that
mr
trump
won
by
a
narrow
margin
this
is
liable
to
get
ugly
not
least
because
most
democratic
proponents
of
impeachment
are
on
the
left
which
sees
mrs
pelosi's
reticence
on
the
issue
as
part
of
a
broader
want
of
conviction
i
think
that
at
a
certain
point
this
is
no
longer
about
politics
says
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
but
that
is
not
true
impeachment
is
almost
always
about
politics
and
mrs
pelosi
as
her
standing
in
her
party
indicates
is
a
better
judge
of
its
interests
than
her
critics
the
decision
to
impeach
is
a
political
one
informed
by
legal
precedent
in
other
words
even
when
it
is
obvious
as
in
mr
trump's
case
that
an
official
has
met
past
impeachment
standards
the
speaker
is
under
no
compulsion
to
impeach
indeed
if
mrs
pelosi
believes
impeaching
a
malfeasant
president
would
make
him
stronger
she
is
entitled
to
argue
that
her
constitutional
duty
is
not
to
do
so
when
mr
amash
accused
her
of
trying
to
play
it
both
ways
in
seeking
to
hold
mr
trump
to
account
while
protecting
democratic
interests
he
was
in
a
sense
merely
describing
her
job
only
if
mrs
pelosi
had
downplayed
mr
trump's
wrongdoing
in
order
not
to
impeach
him
would
she
be
failing
in
her
duty
and
she
has
not
she
says
mr
trump
is
so
obviously
committing
impeachable
offences
that
he
is
becoming
self-impeachable
whether
they
know
it
or
not
most
of
her
democratic
critics
are
also
making
political
calculations
most
democratic
voters
representing
around
of
americans
now
say
mr
trump
should
be
impeached
and
ms
ocasio-cortez
represents
one
of
the
safest
democratic
districts
in
the
country
which
to
boot
she
has
vowed
to
represent
by
putting
a
firecracker
up
the
sort
of
washington
consensus-building
mrs
pelosi
is
engaged
in
yet
to
win
a
majority
in
the
house
and
probably
also
the
presidency
democrats
need
over
of
the
electorate
because
of
the
uneven
distribution
of
their
votes
and
mrs
pelosi
has
that
margin
of
flakier
democrats
and
independents
who
are
much
less
likely
to
consider
impeaching
mr
trump
warranted
or
important
strongly
in
mind
that
is
why
she
has
taken
more
pains
to
promote
and
mollify
the
concerns
of
the
many
new
democratic
members
elected
in
competitive
districts
last
november
than
lefties
such
as
ms
ocasio-cortez
the
torrent
of
bills
house
democrats
have
passed
has
been
designed
to
honour
promises
on
health
care
fighting
corruption
and
so
forth
that
these
majority-making
democrats
made
on
the
trail
so
far
few
of
them
have
said
they
want
to
impeach
mr
trump
this
may
well
change
the
mueller
report
has
had
little
impact
on
public
opinion
mainly
because
hardly
anyone
even
in
congress
according
to
mr
amash
has
read
it
yet
in
his
frenzied
effort
to
shut
down
legitimate
congressional
probes
into
his
affairs
mr
trump
is
threatening
to
re-enact
in
plain
sight
the
obstructive
behaviour
it
describes
if
that
starts
to
interest
marginal
voters
in
impeaching
him
expect
mrs
pelosi
to
do
so
but
don't
try
second-guessing
her
the
democratic
speaker
knows
her
caucus
better
than
her
critics
do
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
