a
jail
in
denver
offers
some
lessons
for
criminal-justice
reformers
as
new
york's
incarceration
rate
falls
the
city
is
casting
around
for
smaller
jails
to
copy
on
june
th
layleen
polanco
a
year-old
transgender
woman
was
found
dead
in
her
cell
at
rikers
island
jail
she
was
being
held
on
bail
for
a
misdemeanour
prostitution
offence
and
the
lowest-level
drug
charge
and
she
was
being
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
fighting
the
death
was
not
unusual
in
a
jail
renowned
for
corruption
and
cruelty
where
mostly
poor
defendants
can
languish
for
years
while
awaiting
trial
bill
de
blasio
new
york's
mayor
plans
to
shut
rikers
by
and
replace
it
with
four
smaller
jails
near
courthouses
in
brooklyn
the
bronx
manhattan
and
queens
among
other
things
this
fresh
start
offers
a
chance
to
rethink
prison
architecture
in
the
city
america's
prison-builders
have
mostly
wrestled
with
basic
questions
such
as
whether
to
house
prisoners
separately
or
together
and
how
to
manage
them
with
as
few
staff
as
possible
in
the
second
half
of
the
th
century
tough-on-crime
laws
sparked
a
boom
in
low-cost
jail-building
by
one
in
every
adults
was
typically
housed
in
an
isolated
cinder-block
compound
surrounded
by
barbed
wire
more
recently
there
has
been
a
fashion
for
high-rise
prisons
in
the
middle
of
struggling
cities
milwaukee
has
a
storey
jail
in
new
york
awareness
of
the
high
costs
of
incarceration
has
spurred
demand
for
more
humane
spaces
this
is
a
watershed
moment
says
david
ziskind
a
criminal-justice
expert
at
stv
an
architecture
firm
the
new
jails
are
expected
to
emphasise
rehabilitation
over
retribution
and
be
used
more
sparingly
the
goal
is
to
house
under
inmates
at
each
facility
which
means
reducing
the
total
prisoner
population
to
under
this
is
far
less
than
the
nearly
housed
at
rikers
but
it
is
in
line
with
current
trends
new
york's
prisoner
count
has
already
fallen
since
mr
de
blasio
took
office
in
jail
admissions
are
down
nearly
meanwhile
crime
continues
to
fall
architects
will
submit
proposals
in
but
the
city
is
already
casting
about
for
models
officials
have
visited
the
bed
van
cise-simonet
detention
centre
in
denver
colorado
this
building
which
opened
in
offers
some
lessons
with
its
limestone
fa
ade
van
cise-simonet
looks
more
like
a
museum
or
a
university
library
the
interior
is
notable
for
its
open
spaces
and
the
natural
light
from
its
bar-less
windows
a
booking
area
for
new
inmates
resembles
a
bus
terminal
with
a
few
holding
cells
for
those
who
misbehave
instead
of
long
grey
corridors
lined
with
clanging
metal-doored
cells
inmates
stay
in
smaller
units
that
hold
up
to
people
plus
a
deputy
in
theory
this
reduces
violence
among
inmates
and
against
staff
because
officers
get
to
know
the
prisoners
and
can
see
problems
before
they
arise
the
pods
have
areas
for
meals
classes
and
recreation
which
limits
the
risk
that
comes
from
taking
inmates
to
and
from
their
beds
several
times
a
day
the
facility
also
has
a
full
medical
unit
a
mental-health
unit
and
two
courtrooms
to
handle
misdemeanours
and
preliminary
hearings
environments
cue
behaviour
says
ken
ricci
of
cgl
a
consulting
firm
who
was
a
principal
designer
of
van
cise-simonet
and
is
a
member
of
the
mayor's
taskforce
to
close
rikers
sunlight
and
better
acoustics
improve
life
for
the
staff
the
denver
jail
suggests
design
has
its
limits
though
overcrowding
and
short-staffing
dogged
the
facility
for
years
and
a
report
in
the
denver
post
in
found
that
the
number
of
assaults
between
inmates
and
against
staff
had
started
going
up
the
city
spent
around
m
to
settle
claims
from
the
deaths
of
two
inmates
in
and
one
of
whom
was
mentally
ill
mr
ricci
is
quick
to
concede
that
the
design
of
van
cise-simonet
is
not
perfect
zoning
constraints
on
the
height
and
width
of
the
building
left
inmates
and
staff
with
less
elbow
room
and
made
view-obscuring
pillars
structurally
necessary
an
architect's
nightmare
attracting
and
retaining
staff
is
hard
when
the
unemployment
rate
is
so
low
especially
as
the
job
now
demands
an
ability
to
manage
psychiatric
emergencies
and
behave
more
like
a
social
worker
rather
than
merely
booting
recalcitrant
inmates
in
the
stomach
our
goal
is
to
send
these
people
back
to
the
community
in
better
shape
than
how
they
came
to
us
says
elias
diggins
the
denver
sheriff
department
chief
and
the
president
of
the
american
jail
association
better
design
is
a
good
start
but
only
that
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
