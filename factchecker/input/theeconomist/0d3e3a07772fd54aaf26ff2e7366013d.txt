sound
like
the
doodlings
of
a

boy
both
appear
in
the
trump
administration's
missile-defence
review
published
on
january
th
it
lays
out
a
celestial
vision
of
homeland
defence
that
looks
cosmically
expensive
and
technologically
dubious
america
does
not
skimp
on
shooting
missiles
out
of
the
sky
its
budget
allocated
bn
to
the
task
roughly
equivalent
to
the
entire
defence
budget
of
canada
or
turkey
since
it
has
splashed
out
over
bn
some
of
that
is
spent
on
ship-based

america
has

gmd
directed
at

at

and
rising
it
is
the
pentagon's
fourth-most-expensive
weapon
system
launches
are
spotted
by
infrared
satellites
and
a
radar
network
stretching
from
cape
cod
to
japan
and
then
in
theory
struck
by
one
of
interceptors
in
alaska
and
california
though
gmd
was
declared
ready
in
it
was
not
tested
against
an
icbm-type
target
until
and
then
under
generous
conditions
using
four
interceptors
against
one
warhead
is
assumed
to
give
a
chance
of
a
hit
that
sounds
promising
but
if
merely
a
dozen
missiles
were
volleyed
at
america
not
only
would
it
soak
up
more
than
bn
of
interceptors
but
a
single
warhead
would
still
have
a
chance
of
getting
acquainted
with
an
american
city
the
average
revolver
offers
better
odds
for
a
game
of
russian
roulette
the
trump
administration
has
been
adding
interceptors
beefing
up
radars
and
conducting
new
tests
but
the
latest
missile-defence
review
the
first
in
nine
years
makes
some
more
radical
proposals
one
is
to
shoot
down
missiles
in
their
boost
phase
as
they
take
off
when
they
are
slower
and
harder
to
disguise
rather
than
above
the
atmosphere
as
gmd
aims
to
do
since
the
boost
phase
lasts
for
only
a
few
minutes
that
requires
spotting
launches
and
pouncing
quickly
the
suggestion
is
that
fighter
jets
like
the
f-
or
even
drones
could
be
surged
towards
enemy
launchpads
in
a
crisis
armed
with
new
interceptor
missiles
or
compact
lasers
that
carries
obvious
risks
so
the
second
strategy
is
to
do
more
sensing
and
shooting
from
space
this
fits
with
mr
trump's
galactic
proclivities
in
december
he
ordered
the
creation
of
a
new
space
command
to
run
military
operations
in
space
a
new
space
force
and
space
development
agency
are
in
the
works
the
pentagon
is
especially
keen
to
put
larger
numbers
of
smaller
and
cheaper
satellites
into
lower
orbit
for
birth
to
death
tracking
from
detecting
tell-tale
plumes
at
launch
to
establishing
whether
an
intercept
is
successful
officials
are
also
beginning
a
six-month
study
into
the
feasibility
of
putting
the
interceptors
themselves
whether
rockets
or
lasers
into
space
few
of
these
ideas
are
new
an
airborne
laser
was
successfully
tested
against
missiles
in
the
obama
administration
poured
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
into
space
sensors
the
vision
of
orbiting
lasers
harks
back
to
the
reagan
administration's
strategic
defence
initiative
widely
dubbed
star
wars
in
the
national
research
council
published
a
detailed
and
scathing
judgment
of
such
methods
boost-phase
defence
it
said
is
not
practical
or
cost
effective
under
real-world
conditions
for
the
foreseeable
future
it
pointed
out
that
rocket
motors
burn
out
so
quickly
that
interceptors
would
have
to
get
unfeasibly
close
to
the
launch-pad
space-based
interceptors
might
deal
with
that
problem
but
would
require
a
preposterously
large
constellation
of
satellites
costing
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
the
pentagon
insists
that
new
commercially
available
technology
will
bring
down
costs
its
task
is
to
persuade
congress
that
the
budget
at
least
is
not
headed
to
infinity
and
beyond
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
