the
right
way
to
help
poor
children
and
their
mothers
why
cash
beats
government-funded
childcare
daniel
patrick
moynihan
the
sociologist
and
senator
who
died
in
once
said
that
america's
longstanding
preference
for
bureaucratic
social
services
for
the
poor
over
simply
handing
them
cash
was
like
feeding
the
sparrows
by
feeding
the
horses
the
universal
child-care
plan
offered
by
elizabeth
warren
a
senator
from
massachusetts
and
democratic
candidate
for
falls
into
such
a
snare
given
the
cost
of
american
child
care
which
is
the
least
affordable
among
developed
countries
some
plan
is
clearly
needed
her
ambitious
proposal
calls
for
publicly
funded
child-care
centres
nationwide
which
would
be
free
to
those
making
less
than
of
the
poverty
line
or
for
a
family
of
four
and
cost
no
more
than
of
income
for
those
above
it
the
complicated
infrastructure
it
envisions
would
be
less
efficient
than
simple
cash
transfers
to
poor
families
with
children
and
would
give
uncertain
returns
in
the
late
s
the
canadian
province
of
quebec
introduced
a
universal
child-care
scheme
backed
by
large
subsidies
out-of-pocket
costs
were
limited
to
a
day
when
social
scientists
tracked
the
life
outcomes
for
the
children
and
parents
who
took
part
in
the
programme
the
results
were
unexpectedly
terrible
children
came
out
no
cleverer
and
with
worse
health
life
satisfaction
and
rates
of
criminal
offence
although
women
worked
more
the
taxes
generated
on
their
additional
labour
fell
far
short
of
the
costs
of
running
the
programme
studies
of
european
programmes
have
found
more
positive
results
but
the
outcomes
of
the
recent
experiment
in
north
america
are
troubling
it
tells
us
that
a
poorly
funded
programme
that
was
rapidly
rolled
out
did
not
generate
the
benefits
that
were
promised
says
amitabh
chandra
a
professor
of
economics
at
harvard
and
we
have
a
history
of
underfunding
programmes
in
the
us
when
they
disproportionately
benefit
the
poor
in
practice
the
universal
child
care
envisioned
by
ms
warren
would
operate
as
more
of
a
middle-class
entitlement
than
a
well-targeted
anti-poverty
programme
the
costs
of
child
care
vary
enormously
by
place
in
washington
dc
it
costs
around
a
year
assuming
identical
costs
ms
warren's
plan
would
grant
a
well-to-do
professional
couple
in
the
city
making
an
subsidy
to
deposit
junior
in
day
care
and
although
it
is
true
that
a
poor
working
mother
would
receive
the
same
service
free
of
charge
the
public
costs
of
looking
after
her
child
might
well
exceed
her
annual
earnings
giving
even
a
fraction
of
that
amount
in
cash
to
mother
and
child
would
probably
be
better
for
both
poor
and
ethnic-minority
mothers
are
also
less
likely
to
use
formal
day-care
centres
in
the
first
place
they
tend
to
stay
at
home
to
look
after
children
or
to
use
informal
child
care
such
as
relatives
there's
this
amazing
tone-deafness
to
the
cultural
implications
it's
not
just
a
technocratic
policy
to
close
the
female
wage
gap
or
to
grow
the
earnings
of
kids
says
sam
hammond
of
the
niskanen
centre
a
think-tank
the
quebec
experiment
showed
a
significant
crowding
out
of
informal
child-care
arrangements
in
favour
of
cheap
government-run
facilities
ms
warren
herself
once
grasped
this
conundrum
in
her
book
the
two-income
trap
co-written
with
her
daughter
in
she
dismissed
the
sacred
cow
of
free
day
care
subsidised
day
care
benefits
only
some
kids
those
whose
parents
both
work
outside
the
home
day-care
subsidies
offer
no
help
for
families
with
a
stay-at-home
mother
ms
warren
wrote
then
she
also
recognised
its
possible
exacerbating
effect
on
inequality
every
dollar
spent
to
subsidise
the
price
of
day
care
frees
up
a
dollar
for
the
two-income
family
to
spend
in
the
bidding
wars
for
housing
tuition
and
everything
else
she
continued
a
better
way
to
reduce
child
poverty
is
to
provide
a
basic
monthly
child
allowance
which
could
be
spent
on
food
rent
or
formal
child
care
michael
bennet
and
sherrod
brown
two
democratic
senators
have
proposed
paying
families
per
child
each
month
which
would
cut
the
child-poverty
rate
by
almost
half
and
at
the
same
cost
as
ms
warren's
plan
if
child
care
is
to
be
subsidised
it
is
probably
better
done
through
means-tested
tax
credits
sadly
the
phrase
fully
refundable
child
tax
credits
does
not
stir
the
soul
of
democratic
primary
voters
quite
like
universal
child-care
does
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
