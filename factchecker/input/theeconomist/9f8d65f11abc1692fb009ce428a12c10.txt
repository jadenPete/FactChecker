college
athletes
in
america
may
be
allowed
to
profit
from
their
talent
california
is
leading
the
way
on
paying
students
in
sport
tune
in
to
a
college
football
match
in
america
and
you
might
think
that
you
were
watching
a
professional
rather
than
an
amateur
sport
the
biggest
stadiums
routinely
fill
over
seats
corporate
sponsorships
are
common
television
broadcasts
are
supersaturated
with
ads
for
expensive
pick-up
trucks
and
beers
all
told
america's
college
athletic
departments
brought
in
a
combined
bn
of
revenue
in
up
from
bn
in
despite
the
popularity
of
their
output
college
athletes
receive
no
remuneration
the
national
college
athletic
association
ncaa
which
governs
college
sports
has
long
forbidden
its
players
to
receive
any
compensation
these
ordinances
have
always
been
controversial
but
after
years
of
legal
challenges
and
intense
public
scrutiny
the
ncaa's
clampdown
on
paying
jocks
is
at
last
starting
to
crack
on
september
th
california
passed
a
bill
which
would
allow
athletes
at
colleges
in
the
state
with
lucrative
sports
programmes
to
hire
agents
and
earn
money
on
the
side
through
sponsorship
deals
or
autograph
sales
the
bill
still
needs
to
be
signed
by
the
governor
and
would
not
come
into
effect
until
similar
legislation
is
being
considered
in
other
states
and
at
the
federal
level
some
lawmakers
would
like
to
go
one
step
further
senator
bernie
sanders
a
presidential
candidate
put
it
plainly
when
he
tweeted
college
athletes
are
workers
pay
them
yet
treating
athletes
as
employees
could
create
complications
title
ix
a
federal
law
prevents
colleges
from
discriminating
between
students
by
sex
would
this
mean
that
colleges
would
have
to
pay
their
female
basketball
players
as
much
as
males
for
example
even
if
the
men
bring
in
more
revenue
richard
borghesi
an
economist
at
the
university
of
south
florida-sarasota
has
written
a
pair
of
papers
looking
at
how
much
top
athletes
would
make
if
they
were
paid
according
to
their
ability
to
generate
revenue
for
their
colleges
in
addition
to
ticket
and
merchandise
sales
college
athletes
also
play
a
role
in
soliciting
donations
from
rich
alumni
taking
these
factors
into
account
mr
borghesi
estimates
that
the
top
of
football
and
of
basketball
players
would
be
paid
around
and
a
year
respectively
the
ncaa
opposes
california's
efforts
the
association
notes
that
college
athletes
already
receive
compensation
in
the
form
of
scholarships
and
argues
that
any
further
remuneration
would
jeopardise
the
integrity
of
what
is
meant
to
be
an
amateur
endeavour
the
ncaa
has
also
threatened
to
ban
californian
colleges
from
competing
in
national
championships
although
the
ncaa's
objections
may
have
been
valid
at
some
point
they
make
little
sense
today
the
two
most
lucrative
college
sports
american
football
and
basketball
are
highly
competitive
many
universities
are
willing
to
bend
over
backwards
to
enroll
talented
players
and
the
argument
that
university
athletics
remains
amateur
would
hardly
earn
passing
marks
in
even
an
introductory
college
course
china's

europe's
