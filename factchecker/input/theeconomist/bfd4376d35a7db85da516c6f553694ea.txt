defy
abba
bernie
sanders
a
contender
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
will
face
plenty
of
opposition
to
his
latest
plan
to
force
companies
to
hand
over
shares
to
workers
but
at
least
he
will
not
have
to
compete
with
abba
when
the
swedish
social
democrats
proposed
the
same
idea
in
the
pop
group
behind
the
winner
takes
it
all
and
money
money
money
helped
lead
opposition
to
the
proposal
producing
pamphlets
and
even
hosting
an
open
air
gig
to
protest
in
the
end
abba
saw
off
the
socialist
menace
the
idea
was
watered
down
by
the
swedish
government
then
scrapped
in
the
s
under
the
scheme
being
considered
by
the
sanders
campaign
businesses
will
issue
a
small
chunk
of
equity
each
year
to
a
fund
controlled
by
current
workers
the
fund
will
pay
dividends
to
employees
while
also
giving
them
the
same
say
as
other
shareholders
supporters
argue
that
companies
rewarding
bosses
with
equity
has
been
the
norm
for
years
if
this
is
a
sensible
way
to
incentivise
management
they
ask
why
not
do
the
same
for
workers
critics
argue
that
it
amounts
to
de
facto
confiscation
by
the
state
the
idea
first
devised
by
rudolf
meidner
a
swedish
economist
in
the
s
lay
dormant
until
it
was
rediscovered
by
british
wonks
who
pitched
it
to
an
increasingly
left-wing
labour
opposition
in
britain
john
mcdonnell
the
shadow
chancellor
adopted
it
and
announced
that
under
a
labour
government
workers
at
businesses
with
more
than
staff
would
be
gradually
handed
of
the
stock
also
involved
in
blowing
the
dust
off
the
idea
have
been
democracy
collaborative
a
think-tank
which
has
lobbied
heavily
for
the
proposal
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
one
of
their
main
backers
is
the
novo
foundation
a
fund
set
up
by
peter
and
jennifer
buffett
with
the
cash
fronted
by
peter's
dad
warren
a
new
model
of
business
ownership
is
being
developed
with
cash
left
over
from
the
old
one
british
businesses
have
started
eyeing
the
scheme
nervously
now
that
mr
mcdonnell's
labour
party
has
a
decent
chance
of
taking
power
executives
grumble
that
it
is
causing
more
of
a
headache
than
britain
leaving
the
eu
if
mr
sanders
ends
up
in
the
white
house
they
will
face
a
transatlantic
pincer
movement
for
lefties
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
this
is
part
of
the
plan
american
thinkers
hoping
to
shove
the
democratic
party
further
left
can
point
to
britain
as
a
laboratory
of
left-wing
ideas
meanwhile
british
politicos
whose
bookshelves
bulge
with
biographies
of
dead
american
presidents
and
boxsets
of
the
west
wing
crave
american
approval
an
idea
backed
by
a
presidential
candidate
seems
less
outlandish
how
far
the
proposal
will
go
under
mr
sanders
has
yet
to
be
decided
it
is
flexible
in
effect
the
policy
creates
a
knob
which
can
be
twiddled
between
a
redistribution
of
capital
and
control
all
the
way
to
handing
the
means
of
production
to
workers
wholesale
as
was
mr
meidner's
original
intention
until
abba
intervened
polling
for
democracy
collaborative
indicates
that
people
like
the
idea
about
of
american
voters
support
putting
up
to
half
of
a
company's
shares
in
a
trust
for
workers
even
of
republicans
support
such
a
scheme
with
only
opposed
an
idea
that
was
rejected
as
too
left-wing
in
s
sweden
is
being
revived
in
the
twin
engines
of
the
anglo-saxon
economy
nevertheless
with
abba
on
tour
again
in
america
this
summer
maybe
mr
sanders
should
watch
out
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
