harvard's
policy
against
single-sex
clubs
was
meant
to
protect
women
it
seems
to
be
doing
the
opposite
i
joined
the
delta
gamma
sorority
at
harvard
university
because
i
was
looking
for
a
group
like
my
high-school
friends
that
shared
the
same
values
and
would
come
together
regardless
of
major
or
extra-curriculars
says
becca
ramos
who
was
chapter
president
of
delta
gamma
in
there
were
so
many
nights
when
we
studied
together
into
the
small
hours
we'd
go
to
each
other's
thesis
presentations
i
went
to
one
of
my
sisters
presentation
on
volcanoes
i
knew
nothing
about
volcanoes
except
that
they
exploded
but
i
was
so
proud
of
her
that
support
network
is
no
longer
available
under
new
rules
introduced
in
members
of
what
harvard's
administration
calls
unrecognised
single-gender
social
organisations
are
no
longer
eligible
for
campus
leadership
positions
such
as
captaincy
of
sports
teams
or
for
dean's
letters
of
recommendation
for
scholarships
if
the
organisations
went
mixed
their
members
could
escape
these
sanctions
delta
gamma
has
closed
all
but
one
of
the
other
sororities
have
either
followed
suit
or
in
a
few
cases
gone
mixed
but
the
remaining
single-sex
organisations
have
not
given
up
last
month
a
group
of
them
filed
lawsuits
one
in
a
federal
court
and
one
in
a
massachusetts
court
the
university
will
respond
next
month
despite
scandals
involving
sexual
misbehaviour
and
drunkenness
america's
fraternities
and
sororities
are
flourishing
plenty
of
universities
welcome
them
on
campus
for
the
support
they
provide
to
students
says
dani
weatherford
executive
director
of
the
national
panhellenic
conference
the
biggest
umbrella
organisation
of
sororities
undergraduate
membership
of
the
npc's
sororities
has
increased
by
over
the
past
ten
years
but
a
few
universities
have
clamped
down
on
fraternities
amherst
has
banned
them
altogether
harvard's
policy
is
nearly
as
stringent
the
motivation
for
harvard's
action
seems
mixed
in
her
letter
to
harvard
college's
dean
the
university's
then
president
drew
faust
cited
deeply
rooted
gender
attitudes
and
the
related
issues
of
sexual
misconduct
for
which
the
sororities
were
presumably
not
being
held
responsible
as
well
as
forms
of
privilege
and
exclusion
at
odds
with
our
deepest
values
which
she
accused
sororities
fraternities
and
final
clubs
the
most
exclusive
single-sex
social
clubs
of
perpetuating
the
policy
has
plenty
of
support
but
many
oppose
it
too
students
marched
in
protest
and
a
sizeable
minority
of
faculty
are
against
it
including
harry
lewis
a
former
dean
of
the
college
and
a
computer-science
professor
for
years
who
taught
both
bill
gates
and
mark
zuckerberg
he
has
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
the
women
in
his
discipline
who
join
sororities
it's
a
way
of
getting
away
from
the
guys
who
are
always
looking
at
them
there'll
be
two
women
in
a
class
of
men
he
characterises
the
battle
as
the
old
liberal
left
libertarians
and
the
right
against
the
new
more
authoritarian
left
and
the
university
authorities
the
argument
against
the
administration
is
in
part
one
of
principle
a
former
harvard
administrator
who
regards
the
clubs
as
pretty
obnoxious
if
i
had
a
kid
at
harvard
who
belonged
to
one
i'd
tell
him
he
could
pay
his
own
tuition
nevertheless
argues
that
freedom
of
association
is
important
if
we'd
happily
write
letters
for
people
who
were
members
of
the
communist
party
or
the
nra
it
seems
lunacy
to
say
that
we'd
refuse
that
to
somebody
who
wanted
to
join
one
of
these
clubs
opponents
also
argue
that
abolishing
the
organisations
is
not
going
to
fulfil
the
administration's
aims
if
the
problem
is
gender
attitudes
which
presumably
means
discrimination
against
women
then
the
policy
is
counter-productive
women
are
losing
out
more
than
men
while
the
sororities
have
almost
all
closed
the
men's
organisations
have
not
the
men's
groups
are
older
and
therefore
have
a
larger
alumni
base
explains
ellen
rothschild
a
former
president
of
harvard's
alpha
phi
chapter
they're
able
to
turn
away
from
the
scholarships
because
they
can
rely
on
these
outside
networks
if
the
aim
is
to
reduce
sexual
harassment
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
shutting
down
single-sex
clubs
would
achieve
that
a
harvard
task
force
on
combating
sexual
harassment
which
urged
ms
faust
to
address
the
distinctive
problems
presented
by
the
final
clubs
based
its
concerns
on
a
survey
in
which
of
harvard
women
who
had
taken
part
in
final
clubs
events
had
experienced
sexual
harassment
compared
with
of
the
female
student
body
as
a
whole
critics
point
out
that
correlation
does
not
imply
causation
and
that
the
same
survey
showed
that
of
non-consensual
penetration
involving
physical
force
at
harvard
took
place
in
dorms
which
are
run
by
the
university
if
the
problem
the
university
wants
to
address
is
class
exclusivity
rather
than
gender
discrimination
then
the
university's
policy
would
not
mitigate
it
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
mixed-sex
clubs
would
be
any
less
socially
exclusive
than
single-sex
ones
ms
ramos
says
she
and
her
sisters
at
delta
gamma
surveyed
the
sorority
and
found
that
it
was
more
socio-economically
diverse
than
the
university
whoever
wins
in
the
courts
one
sort
of
freedom
will
be
the
loser
if
the
administrators
win
the
students
right
to
belong
to
whatever
organisations
they
like
will
be
constrained
if
harvard
loses
the
right
of
a
private
organisation
to
run
itself
as
it
pleases
will
be
limited
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
