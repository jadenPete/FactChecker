andrew
yang
prophet
of
doom
pessimism
delights
primary
voters
andrew
yang
the
new
york
entrepreneur
running
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
cannot
be
accused
of
lacking
confidence
i
only
see
two
outcomes
in
this
race
one
i
win
or
two
someone
else
wins
and
takes
the
vast
majority
of
my
ideas
into
the
white
house
he
says
from
his
campaign
headquarters
in
midtown
manhattan
by
branding
himself
a
doomsayer
of
the
impending
automation
apocalypse
which
he
warns
will
destroy
most
jobs
and
roil
society
mr
yang
has
cultivated
a
devoted
following
leapfrogging
better-known
candidates
like
bill
de
blasio
the
city's
mayor
and
kirsten
gillibrand
one
of
new
york's
senators
in
such
a
crowded
field
with
roughly
two
dozen
contenders
scoring
in
the
polls
is
no
small
feat
but
becoming
a
serious
contender
is
a
different
matter
mr
yang
hopes
his
break
will
come
in
the
upcoming
primary
debate
in
miami
where
he
will
share
the
stage
with
heavyweights
like
joe
biden
kamala
harris
and
bernie
sanders
his
appeal
hinges
on
an
economic
anxiety
that
borders
on
outright
fear
mr
yang
decided
to
call
his
campaign
book
the
war
on
normal
people
in
it
he
describes
the
advent
of
automation
and
artificial
intelligence
as
very
scary
he
warns
that
millions
of
truck-drivers
forced
out
of
work
by
self-driving
cars
and
retail
workers
done
in
by
automated
kiosks
could
riot
if
we
don't
start
getting
ahead
of
that
curve
we're
going
to
be
doomed
to
worse
than
donald
trump
over
time
he
says
the
antidote
to
this
impending
calamity
is
a
universal
basic
income
ubi
of
a
month
for
each
and
every
american
adult
which
mr
yang
calls
a
freedom
dividend
because
that
polls
better
at
times
mr
yang's
freedom
dividend
is
almost
a
universal
panacea
it
is
his
first
answer
when
asked
about
combating
poverty
spurring
entrepreneurship
narrowing
the
racial
wealth
gap
and
reversing
educational
disparities
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
but
the
idea
has
cross-ideological
appeal
both
to
libertarians
who
think
the
government
does
least
harm
by
shovelling
cash
to
people
and
to
bleeding
hearts
concerned
with
the
plight
of
the
poor
and
downtrodden
devotees
who
call
themselves
the
yang
gang
throng
his
rallies
wearing
hats
emblazoned
with
the
word
math
for
which
the
acronym
make
america
think
harder
has
been
devised
this
is
not
a
lefty
idea
mr
yang
says
noting
that
the
country's
red-leaning
rural
interior
would
gain
most
from
his
proposal
the
one
state
that
has
a
dividend
right
now
is
alaska
which
is
a
deep-red
conservative
state
alaska's
universal
benefit
paid
out
of
oil
revenues
is
typically
less
than
per
year
mr
yang's
proposal
is
six
times
as
generous
offering
per
year
and
would
cost
roughly
trn
the
entire
annual
budget
encompassing
defence
spending
social
security
medicare
and
everything
else
is
trn
how
this
will
be
paid
for
is
unclear
mr
yang
has
proposed
introducing
a
value-added
tax
and
extracting
sufficiently
large
sums
from
the
tech
firms
automating
jobs
away
its
cost
does
not
make
the
freedom
dividend
an
outlier
in
the
primary
debate
most
of
the
democratic
candidates
are
pitching
multi-trillion
plans
of
one
sort
or
another
mr
sanders
wants
medicare
for
all
which
mr
yang
and
many
of
his
competitors
also
endorse
while
elizabeth
warren
would
like
to
channel
a
few
trillion
towards
green
manufacturing
free
college
and
universal
child
care
see
lexington
all
these
ideas
would
have
seemed
like
fringy
leftism
to
mainstream
democrats
just
four
years
ago
mr
yang's
chief
contribution
might
follow
similar
lines
he
could
hope
to
inject
his
ideas
into
the
mainstream
of
democratic
politics
his
most
valuable
policy
contributions
may
lie
elsewhere
however
mr
yang
argues
more
persuasively
than
most
politicians
that
he
chooses
his
positions
on
data
and
evidence
his
campaign
website
sports
at
last
count
proposals
running
from
the
consequential
imposing
a
tax
on
carbon
pollution
legalising
marijuana
decriminalising
opioids
and
reforming
zoning
rules
to
the
zany
like
offering
free
marriage
counselling
to
all
many
of
them
are
quite
sensible
a
good
few
are
refreshingly
unorthodox
too
mr
yang
has
not
shied
away
from
pointing
out
the
errors
in
the
thinking
of
his
competitors
he
thinks
a
federal
jobs
guarantee
embedded
in
the
widely
accepted
proposal
for
a
green
new
deal
is
a
well-intended
but
terrible
idea
the
liberal
training
fantasy
turning
coal
miners
into
coders
is
mere
wish-fulfilment
as
policy
talk
he'd
like
to
break
the
stranglehold
that
college
has
on
learning
that
pushes
democrats
to
prefer
free
university
tuition
to
vocational
training
he
is
one
of
the
few
candidates
willing
to
publicly
admit
that
charter
schools
which
are
government-funded
but
privately
run
are
not
abominable
i'm
pro-good
school
and
there
are
some
very
good
charters
i
think
the
democrats
who
are
frankly
just
jumping
into
bed
with
the
teachers
unions
are
doing
our
kids
a
disservice
among
the
ideas
that
an
eventual
white
house
occupant
will
inevitably
steal
from
him
those
would
be
the
right
ones
to
start
with
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
