donald
trump
wants
a
loyalist
as
america's
top
intelligence
official
dan
coats
is
likely
to
be
replaced
by
a
fierce
partisan
for
decades
america's
top
intelligence
official
responsible
for
assessing
and
co-ordinating
information
from
the
country's
multiple
intelligence
agencies
was
the
director
of
central
intelligence
who
also
headed
the
cia
many
had
qualms
about
this
arrangement
running
an
agency
as
large
and
complex
as
the
cia
was
a
formidable
job
in
its
own
right
combining
it
with
cross-government
information
assessment
and
being
the
president's
chief
intelligence
analyst
was
somewhere
between
unwieldy
and
impossible
those
misgivings
grew
after
the
september
th
attacks
and
the
commission
recommended
creating
a
director
of
national
intelligence
dni
to
head
an
office
focused
solely
on
intelligence
co-ordination
and
reducing
bureaucratic
barriers
to
sharing
intelligence
the
job
is
something
of
a
poisoned
chalice
it
combines
tremendous
responsibility
with
scant
authority
america
has
different
intelligence
agencies
not
including
the
dni's
office
the
dni
cannot
order
them
to
do
anything
except
for
the
cia
the
heads
of
those
agencies
all
report
to
other
bosses
the
defence
agencies
to
the
defence
secretary
the
fbi
chief
to
the
attorney-general
and
so
forth
the
dni's
task
is
to
give
the
president
honest
intelligence
assessments
even
if
they
are
not
what
he
wants
to
hear
dan
coats
did
that
he
defended
the
assessment
that
russia
interfered
in
the
election
even
as
donald
trump
publicly
accepted
vladimir
putin's
denial
he
testified
that
islamic
state
which
mr
trump
claims
to
have
defeated
remains
capable
of
causing
harm
in
syria
for
such
sins
his
relationship
with
mr
trump
suffered
he
will
step
down
on
august
th
mr
trump
intends
to
replace
him
with
john
ratcliffe
a
conservative
congressman
from
texas
who
has
in
the
words
of
mike
morell
a
former
deputy
cia
director
the
least
national
security
experience
and
the
most
partisan
political
experience
of
any
previous
dni
he
was
mayor
of
a
small
town
in
texas
for
eight
years
served
briefly
as
interim
us
attorney
for
the
eastern
district
of
texas
the
district's
lead
federal
prosecutor
and
is
in
his
third
term
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
first
on
the
intelligence
committee
by
contrast
mr
coats
spent
years
in
congress
was
ambassador
to
germany
and
nearly
became
george
w.
bush's
defence
secretary
his
predecessor
james
clapper
ran
two
intelligence
agencies
and
oversaw
four
as
undersecretary
of
defence
for
intelligence
the
first
dni
john
negroponte
spent
years
in
the
foreign
service
before
serving
as
america's
first
post-saddam
ambassador
to
iraq
but
what
mr
ratcliffe
lacks
in
experience
he
makes
up
for
in
devotion
to
mr
trump
mr
ratcliffe
falsely
accused
robert
mueller
during
his
congressional
testimony
of
having
exceeded
his
brief
as
special
counsel
he
propounded
the
conspiracy
theory
that
there
may
have
been
a
secret
society
of
federal
agents
working
against
mr
trump
the
new
york
times
uncovered
embellishments
to
his
biography
including
one
claim
that
he
arrested
illegal
aliens
in
a
single
day
prosecutors
do
not
have
powers
of
arrest
and
another
that
he
convicted
individuals
funnelling
money
to
hamas
he
did
not
mr
ratcliffe's
nomination
is
not
assured
earlier
this
year
mr
trump
tried
to
nominate
two
unqualified
partisans
stephen
moore
and
herman
cain
to
the
federal
reserve's
board
of
governors
both
withdrew
their
names
because
they
lacked
enough
congressional
support
at
least
a
few
republican
senators
may
similarly
quail
at
handing
a
difficult
non-partisan
job
to
a
lightly
qualified
politician
yet
just
the
floating
of
mr
ratcliffe's
name
highlights
the
contempt
that
mr
trump
has
for
america's
intelligence
services
he
says
mr
ratcliffe's
job
would
be
to
rein
in
the
intelligence
services
that
have
run
amok
by
which
he
seems
to
mean
that
they
offered
views
that
displease
him
that
is
worrying
some
of
america's
greatest
foreign-policy
debacles
have
stemmed
from
politicised
intelligence
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
