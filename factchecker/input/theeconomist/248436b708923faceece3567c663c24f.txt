texan
politicians
put
money
into
sensible
policies
the
state
legislature
long
known
for
its
love
of
culture
wars
is
funding
schools
better
there's
no
compromise
in
washington
right
now
but
the
good
thing
is
there's
compromise
in
texas
says
michael
hinojosa
superintendent
of
the
dallas
independent
school
district
on
may
th
texan
legislators
who
meet
for
days
every
other
year
concluded
their
session
having
passed
several
bills
with
bipartisan
support
including
ones
related
to
public
education
and
property
tax
it
was
the
most
productive
legislative
session
in
a
decade
much
of
the
credit
for
that
should
go
to
voters
in
the
election
who
introduced
political
competition
into
the
legislature
with
democrats
winning
two
state
senate
seats
and
seats
in
the
house
republicans
now
control
of
seats
in
the
state
house
and
in
the
senate
this
prodded
republicans
to
work
on
issues
of
consequence
to
voters
and
to
broker
consensus
far-right
proposals
on
social
issues
that
had
sparked
battles
during
the
legislative
session
including
regulations
on
which
toilets
transgender
people
could
use
were
less
frequent
this
spring
the
major
story
is
what
this
session
wasn't
about
which
is
the
conservative
issues
that
have
been
bandied
about
for
the
last
decade
there
was
a
real
effort
to
get
substantive
things
done
says
jason
sabo
of
frontera
strategies
a
lobbying
firm
the
chief
accomplishment
in
this
legislative
session
was
a
school
finance
bill
which
puts
bn
in
new
state
funding
towards
public
schools
and
bn
towards
reducing
texans
property
taxes
the
additional
school
funding
will
have
the
biggest
impact
around
of
american
children
are
educated
in
texas
but
the
parsimonious
state
has
lagged
behind
for
years
in
funding
and
exam
results
the
republican-led
legislature
cut
over
bn
in
education
funding
in
school
districts
have
sued
the
state
several
times
for
underfunding
education
and
they
have
won
in
texas
ranked
th
in
the
country
in
fourth-grade
reading
proficiency
down
five
places
since
according
to
the
national
assessment
of
educational
progress
which
measures
pupil
achievement
a
report
by
the
texas
commission
on
public
school
finance
released
in
december
concluded
that
the
state
was
failing
roughly
four
out
of
five
texas
pupils
every
year
who
were
leaving
school
without
the
qualifications
to
earn
a
living
wage
this
it
said
was
both
a
poor
return
on
the
invested
in
each
pupil's
education
from
pre-kindergarten
and
a
missed
opportunity
to
capture
the
tremendous
unrealised
potential
of
our
texas
youth
the
new
bill
will
increase
most
school
districts
funding
by
around
but
the
systemic
reforms
will
matter
even
more
says
todd
williams
who
runs
the
commit
partnership
an
educational
non-profit
and
served
on
the
commission
these
include
money
for
full-day
pre-kindergarten
for
poor
pupils
and
those
learning
english
funds
for
elementary
schools
that
elect
to
extend
the
academic
year
by
days
into
the
summer
and
a
merit-pay
programme
that
rewards
top-performing
teachers
and
those
willing
to
work
in
difficult
schools
the
bill
pays
school
districts
more
for
each
high-school
graduate
who
goes
on
to
earn
a
higher
degree
or
certificate
or
joins
the
armed
forces
within
six
months
it
also
requires
school
districts
to
set
five-year
goals
for
third-grade
eight-to-nine-year-olds
reading
and
maths
broken
down
by
race
and
income
and
to
publish
results
annually
what
gets
measured
gets
fixed
and
this
bill
will
require
all
school
districts
to
hold
themselves
accountable
to
specific
goals
says
mr
williams
in
an
effort
to
appease
voters
concerned
not
just
about
school
quality
but
also
their
tax
bills
the
legislature
also
agreed
to
reduce
property
taxes
school
districts
will
no
longer
be
able
to
raise
them
above
a
certain
threshold
each
year
without
holding
a
special
election
boosting
education
spending
while
thinning
revenue
streams
is
a
delicate
balancing
act
but
because
the
state
has
promised
to
step
in
and
cover
the
cost
of
the
tax
cuts
for
homeowners
this
should
not
deal
a
big
blow
to
schools
where
will
the
money
to
increase
funding
while
cutting
taxes
come
from
the
texan
economy
is
booming
and
so
legislators
were
able
to
reshuffle
money
to
fund
education
and
tax
cuts
for
the
next
two
years
without
identifying
a
permanent
new
revenue
source
they
have
to
count
on
this
robust
economy
continuing
says
mr
hinojosa
of
the
dallas
school
district
who
says
that
in
the
short
term
we're
better
off
but
i'm
more
worried
about
four
or
five
years
from
now
texas
does
not
have
an
income
tax
so
the
state
and
local
governments
rely
disproportionately
on
sales
and
property
taxes
in
order
to
ensure
sustainable
funding
for
education
the
state
should
do
all
it
can
to
prevent
small
amounts
of
money
from
slipping
away
says
dick
lavine
of
the
centre
for
public
policy
priorities
a
left-leaning
think-tank
in
austin
but
a
couple
of
other
tax
cuts
made
it
through
this
legislative
session
including
a
bill
that
caps
the
sales
tax
that
can
be
collected
on
purchases
of
boats
and
yachts
up
to
feet
long
which
will
cost
the
state
m
in
forgone
revenue
from
to
governor
greg
abbott
lieutenant-governor
dan
patrick
and
the
house
speaker
dennis
bonnen
known
as
the
state's
big
three
have
enjoyed
mostly
smooth
sailing
they
faced
only
two
setbacks
this
session
first
although
the
three
of
them
supported
a
proposal
to
increase
the
sales-tax
rate
to
fund
property-tax
cuts
the
legislature
killed
the
idea
because
it
would
disproportionately
hurt
the
poor
second
mr
abbott's
nominee
for
secretary
of
state
david
whitley
was
ensnared
in
a
scandal
earlier
this
year
mr
whitley
compiled
a
list
of
people
the
state
suspected
were
not
citizens
and
encouraged
local
election
officials
to
purge
them
from
the
rolls
even
though
some
were
recently
naturalised
the
incident
prompted
a
federal
inquiry
and
court
battle
and
texas
agreed
to
settle
mr
whitley
resigned
after
the
legislature
did
not
vote
to
confirm
him
is
this
focus
on
bread-and-butter
issues
in
the
texas
legislature
the
new
normal
that
will
not
be
clear
until
when
the
legislature
next
convenes
in
the
interim
there
will
be
another
election
that
could
further
alter
the
state's
political
alignment
as
more
young
urban
and
hispanic
voters
go
to
the
polls
in
if
this
session
is
any
guide
this
may
make
texas
politics
comparatively
boring
in
a
good
way
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
