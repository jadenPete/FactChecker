democrats
clamour
again
for
rent
control
some
of
their
ideas
will
have
no
effect
others
will
actually
reduce
the
supply
of
new
housing
american
cities
took
up
rent
control
in
a
moment
of
crisis
during
the
second
world
war
when
workers
migrated
en
masse
to
factories
just
as
the
building
of
new
housing
was
sharply
restricted
to
conserve
materials
in
response
the
federal
government
froze
prices
on
of
the
country's
rental
stock
today
america's
thriving
cities
face
a
homemade
crisis
the
typical
one-bedroom
flat
in
new
york
now
rents
for
the
equivalent
in
san
francisco
rents
for
although
the
building
of
new
housing
is
no
longer
constrained
by
a
massive
war
effort
only
by
rules
and
regulations
of
questionable
design
democrats
in
charge
of
high-cost
cities
are
trying
to
revive
these
old
ideas
oregon
passed
a
statewide
rent-control
measure
in
february
new
york
passed
a
complicated
bill
over
the
objections
of
its
powerful
property
lobby
in
june
gavin
newsom
the
governor
of
california
is
expected
to
sign
one
into
law
soon
even
though
voters
rejected
a
rent-control
expansion
effort
last
november
bernie
sanders
a
socialist
senator
running
for
president
included
nationwide
rent-control
as
part
of
his
housing-policy
plan
at
a
cost
of
trn
over
ten
years
mr
sanders's
proposal
suggests
a
nationwide
cap
of
either
or
of
inflation
whichever
is
higher
elizabeth
warren
has
said
that
states
should
not
pre-empt
local
efforts
at
rent
control
but
has
not
gone
so
far
as
to
propose
a
national
standard
rent
control
is
reviled
by
almost
all
economists
because
of
the
distortions
it
creates
in
housing
markets
while
some
people
benefit
the
resulting
shortages
harm
non-subsidised
residents
and
incentivise
flat-hoarding
by
tenants
and
neglect
by
landlords
the
most
recent
crop
of
efforts
which
are
better
designed
may
not
be
so
bad
but
they
are
in
the
end
a
means
of
temporary
political
appeasement
because
the
true
underlying
problem
supply
is
harder
for
democrats
to
tackle
rather
than
enabling
bureaucrats
to
fix
the
price
of
all
one-bedroom
flats
in
the
city
new
efforts
at
rent
control
instead
aim
to
limit
the
annual
rate
of
increase
on
specified
units
the
higher
this
cap
is
set
the
less
distorting
and
therefore
more
pointless
the
policy
becomes
oregon
has
set
its
annual
cap
at
plus
inflation
california
would
place
it
at
plus
local
inflation
neither
of
these
is
likely
to
apply
outside
the
hottest
rental
markets
the
typical
flat
in
portland
oregon
would
not
have
been
affected
last
year
according
to
data
from
zillow
a
property
website
though
those
in
los
angeles
would
have
been
even
with
more
careful
design
problems
still
arise
when
three
stanford
economists
rebecca
diamond
franklin
qian
and
timothy
mcquade
studied
san
francisco's
rent-control
scheme
they
found
that
though
the
lucky
renters
stayed
put
affected
landlords
cut
supply
by
driving
up
rents
by
citywide
more
than
half
of
rental
stock
in
new
york
city
is
either
rent-controlled
or
rent-stabilised
though
prices
have
surged
all
the
same
when
the
economist
examined
the
most
recent
new
york
housing
and
vacancy
survey
conducted
in
we
found
households
in
manhattan
with
annual
incomes
greater
than
living
in
rent-controlled
and
rent-stabilised
flats
landlords
with
such
affluent
tenants
could
petition
to
get
rid
of
rent
restrictions
but
this
mechanism
has
now
been
removed
by
the
state
legislature
at
least
the
little
people
are
being
looked
after
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
