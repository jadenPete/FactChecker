the
president
stands
accused
of
rape
again
among
the
most
gloomy
things
about
e.
jean
carroll's
accusation
is
how
unsurprising
it
is
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
a
man
is
alleged
to
have
raped
a
woman
in
the
changing
rooms
of
bergdorf
goodman's
lingerie
department
it
was
not
the
first
time
this
woman
had
been
raped
but
it
was
the
last
and
she
has
not
had
sex
since
she
never
went
to
the
police
though
she
did
tell
two
friends
about
the
rape
at
the
time
he
denies
the
allegation
she
is
an
agony
aunt
who
dispenses
upbeat
advice
to
women
urging
them
to
put
troubles
behind
them
and
move
on
he
is
the
sitting
president
of
the
united
states
e.
jean
carroll
is
the
th
woman
to
credibly
accuse
the
president
of
some
kind
of
sexual
molestation
and
the
second
to
accuse
him
of
rape
the
first
donald
trump's
ex-wife
ivana
claimed
during
a
divorce
settlement
in
that
he
had
raped
her
but
later
recanted
ms
carroll
described
her
encounter
with
mr
trump
in
a
searing
essay
called
hideous
men
for
the
cut
a
website
she
explains
her
previous
silence
thus
i
am
a
member
of
the
silent
generation
we
do
not
flap
our
gums
we
laugh
it
off
and
get
on
with
life
getting
on
with
life
is
what
most
washington
politicians
have
been
doing
since
the
accusation
was
made
republicans
have
hardly
bothered
to
defend
mr
trump
nor
democrats
to
denounce
him
among
the
more
gloomy
things
about
ms
carroll's
accusation
is
how
unsurprising
it
is
whether
they
approve
of
him
or
not
only
of
americans
say
the
president
is
a
person
they
admire
according
to
gallup
his
defence
she's
not
my
type
with
its
implication
that
had
she
been
more
attractive
he
might
have
done
it
is
a
reminder
of
why
that
is
so
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
