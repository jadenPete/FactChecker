the
federal
bureaucracies
were
already
creaking
then
donald
trump
became
their
master
when
donald
trump
took
office
in
january
joel
clement
was
entering
his
seventh
year
running
the
interior
department's
office
of
policy
analysis
mr
clement
worked
on
climate-change
preparedness
particularly
for
alaskan
natives
in
low-lying
coastal
villages
he
knew
that
mr
trump
was
a
climate-change
sceptic
but
he
explains
i
didn't
think
there
would
be
a
problem
these
were
actual
people
at
risk
it's
not
a
question
of
what
caused
climate
change
it's
what
was
already
happening
i
was
naive
they
came
out
swinging
in
june
mr
clement
who
has
experience
in
neither
accounting
nor
the
fossil-fuel
industry
was
reassigned
to
an
office
that
collects
royalty
checks
from
oil
gas
and
mining
firms
mr
clement
was
one
of
senior
officials
reassigned
he
resigned
soon
afterwards
perhaps
he
should
not
have
been
surprised
different
administrations
do
things
differently
mr
trump
ran
as
a
climate-change
sceptic
and
made
jeff
sessions
his
first
attorney-general
of
course
his
environmental
and
civil-rights
policies
would
be
different
from
barack
obama's
yet
even
those
who
wish
the
federal
government
were
much
smaller
have
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
its
bureaucracies
can
perform
the
tasks
that
most
americans
agree
are
vital
from
air-traffic
control
to
co-ordinating
the
response
to
natural
disasters
the
federal
government's
ability
to
do
these
things
was
in
question
long
before
then
mr
trump
happened
criticising
the
federal
government
which
employs
around
m
civilians
making
it
america's
single
biggest
employer
is
the
hardiest
perennial
of
american
politics
to
many
outside
washington
dc
it
is
an
abstraction
and
hence
easy
to
caricature
mock
or
blame
its
most
visible
bits
namely
congress
tend
to
be
unpopular
while
its
essential
functions
often
go
unseen
americans
seldom
encounter
the
scientists
ensuring
their
water
stays
clean
or
that
nuclear
waste
is
properly
disposed
of
most
people
do
not
think
of
the
men
and
women
they
salute
at
football
games
as
employees
of
the
federal
government
despite
many
republican
presidents
running
on
government-shrinking
platforms
and
many
democrats
doing
the
opposite
the
size
of
the
federal
workforce
has
remained
relatively
constant
since
the
s
since
the
federal
government
has
added
five
departments
and
multiple
agencies
that
collectively
employ
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
it
has
also
endured
long
hiring
freezes
the
total
number
of
workers
matters
less
to
effective
governance
than
what
those
workers
do
and
here
alarm
bells
have
been
ringing
for
some
time
max
stier
who
heads
the
partnership
for
public
service
a
nonpartisan
group
that
advocates
for
an
effective
civil
service
says
that
the
legacy
government
has
not
kept
up
with
the
world
around
it
and
has
not
been
updated
to
address
the
problems
of
tomorrow
the
government
accountability
office
gao
which
audits
the
federal
government
has
long
warned
of
problems
in
recruiting
and
retaining
public-spirited
workers
the
compensation
system
was
designed
in
and
has
barely
since
been
altered
this
can
make
it
hard
to
offer
competitive
salaries
to
say
cyber-security
experts
civil-service
rules
have
not
been
updated
since
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
the
government
frequently
recruits
for
positions
whose
descriptions
were
written
years
ago
and
do
not
reflect
the
actual
work
being
done
according
to
mr
stier
the
federal
it
workforce
has
five
times
as
many
people
over
the
age
of
as
under
and
most
of
the
bn
spent
on
federal
it
goes
to
patching
and
maintaining
ancient
systems
and
while
low
and
mid-level
government
workers
earn
salaries
comparable
to
or
better
than
what
they
could
make
in
the
private
sector
senior
officials
earn
far
less
government
workers
must
also
endure
hiring
freezes
furloughs
and
government
shutdowns
until
fairly
recently
federal
workers
did
at
least
receive
non-monetary
compensation
such
as
reputational
boosts
or
the
satisfaction
of
contributing
to
the
common
good
teresa
gerton
who
heads
the
national
academy
of
public
administration
says
this
bargain
has
started
to
fray
we
saw
it
during
the
shutdown
last
year
the
impact
that
had
on
the
morale
of
the
current
and
future
public
workforce
was
devastating
nor
does
serving
for
the
most
divisive
president
in
modern
history
provide
the
same
social
compensation
as
serving
a
reagan
or
a
clinton
morale
in
the
intelligence
community
and
state
department
both
frequent
targets
of
mr
trump's
ire
is
lower
than
the
badwater
basin
intelligence
officers
usually
battle
to
get
their
work
included
in
the
president's
daily
brief
today
says
a
source
familiar
with
american
intelligence
they
fight
to
stay
off
it
lest
their
analysis
set
the
president
off
because
it
clashes
with
his
fixed
beliefs
former
foreign-service
officers
fsos
complain
about
a
lack
of
direction
and
months
of
painstaking
work
being
nullified
by
a
presidential
tweet
in
recent
weeks
two
ex-fsos
have
written
op-eds
in
newspapers
explaining
why
they
could
no
longer
serve
this
white
house
that
is
rarely
done
fsos
understand
they
will
serve
administrations
whose
policies
they
may
dislike
but
they
represent
something
greater
than
themselves
and
few
slam
the
door
on
the
way
out
often
the
people
leaving
have
good
offers
in
the
private
sector
and
are
the
sort
of
people
that
a
government
should
want
to
retain
nor
is
the
problem
limited
to
departing
personnel
mr
trump's
penchant
for
installing
people
on
an
acting
basis
rather
than
formally
nominating
them
the
unusually
high
number
of
unfilled
positions
the
headspinning
rate
of
turnover
among
senior
staff
and
the
number
of
nominees
he
has
had
to
withdraw
compared
with
for
mr
obama
at
this
point
in
his
presidency
render
government
unstable
agencies
attention
turns
toward
senior-staff
turnover
rather
than
their
missions
recruits
do
not
know
who
they
will
work
for
in
six
months
of
course
not
everyone
in
government
is
running
for
the
exits
mr
trump
has
plenty
of
fans
among
immigration
police
whose
former
acting
head
praised
the
president
for
taking
the
handcuffs
off
morale
measured
in
annual
surveys
is
also
comparatively
high
at
the
departments
of
transportation
and
health
and
human
services
agencies
that
mr
trump
has
either
boosted
or
ignored
if
the
trump
administration
is
upset
about
the
hollowing
out
of
american
government
it
does
not
show
the
agriculture
department
is
losing
researchers
after
sonny
perdue
the
secretary
announced
that
two
research
agencies
would
move
to
kansas
city
not
an
unreasonable
request
in
itself
but
one
which
some
see
as
a
way
to
sideline
inconvenient
personnel
mick
mulvaney
the
president's
acting
chief
of
staff
celebrated
their
departure
at
a
republican
fundraiser
calling
it
a
wonderful
way
to
streamline
government
but
there
is
a
difference
between
streamlining
government
and
just
not
governing
which
is
what
seems
to
be
happening
in
swathes
of
america's
single-largest
organisation
china's
