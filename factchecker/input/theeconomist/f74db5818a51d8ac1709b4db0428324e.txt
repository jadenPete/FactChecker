if
donald
trump
gets
another
supreme
court
pick
amy
coney
barrett
a
staunch
anti-abortion
judge
appears
to
be
next
in
line
conservatives
may
not
love
everything
about
donald
trump
but
the
th
president's
record
of
installing
federal
judges
has
delighted
them
in
barely
two
years
in
the
white
house
with
guidance
from
the
federalist
society
a
conservative
legal
organisation
mr
trump
has
seated
judges
on
the
district
and
circuit
courts
and
won
confirmation
battles
for
two
supreme
court
justices
the
high-court
picks
neil
gorsuch
replacing
a
like-minded
antonin
scalia
and
brett
kavanaugh
taking
the
seat
of
the
more
moderate
anthony
kennedy
have
bolstered
a
conservative
majority
with
one
more
appointment
mr
trump
could
capture
a
third
of
the
highest
court
and
tilt
it
conservative
for
generations
will
he
get
the
chance
clarence
thomas
who
at
is
the
longest-serving
and
most
thoroughly
conservative
justice
recently
swatted
away
rumours
of
retirement
two
of
the
four
liberal
justices
stephen
breyer
and
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
octogenarians
in
january
a
third
bout
with
cancer
led
ms
ginsburg
to
miss
work
for
the
first
time
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
when
she
returned
to
the
bench
her
posture
and
voice
were
perkier
but
some
liberals
rue
ms
ginsburg's
decision
not
to
retire
a
few
years
ago
when
barack
obama
could
have
chosen
her
successor
if
she
leaves
the
bench
under
mr
trump's
tenure
she
could
be
replaced
by
a
rising
star
of
the
conservative
judicial
movement
amy
coney
barrett
was
born
in
just
as
a
young
ms
ginsburg
started
teaching
law
at
columbia
and
was
launching
the
women's
rights
project
at
the
american
civil
liberties
union
now
in
her
second
year
as
a
judge
on
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
chicago
ms
barrett
was
a
short-lister
last
june
when
mr
kennedy
announced
his
retirement
a
mother
of
seven
and
a
devout
roman
catholic
with
ties
to
people
of
praise
a
charismatic
christian
community
ms
barrett
is
the
product
of
a
catholic
girls
school
in
new
orleans
she
is
a
phi
beta
kappa
graduate
of
rhodes
college
a
presbyterian
liberal-arts
institution
in
tennessee
and
received
top
honours
as
a
law
student
at
notre
dame
she
clerked
for
two
prominent
conservative
jurists
including
mr
scalia
and
after
a
brief
stint
practising
law
in
washington
dc
returned
to
notre
dame
to
teach
in
ms
barrett's
academic
writing
sparked
concerns
among
democrats
when
mr
trump
nominated
her
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
i
would
never
impose
my
own
personal
convictions
upon
the
law
ms
barrett
insisted
when
quizzed
about
catholic
judges
in
capital
cases
a
law-review
article
she
wrote
with
john
garvey
now
president
of
catholic
university
of
america
senator
dianne
feinstein
told
ms
barrett
she
was
concerned
that
it
seemed
the
dogma
lives
loudly
within
you
she
fretted
that
in
light
of
mr
trump's
goal
of
appointing
judges
who
would
automatically
overturn
roe
v
wade
she
would
threaten
abortion
rights
ms
barrett
had
a
ready
answer
she
would
have
no
opportunity
to
be
a
no
vote
on
roe
as
a
circuit-court
judge
she
said
i
would
faithfully
apply
all
supreme
court
precedent
the
same
constraint
does
not
bind
supreme
court
justices
and
in
several
law-review
articles
ms
barrett
has
argued
for
a
more
flexible
conception
of
stare
decisis
the
principle
that
justices
should
ordinarily
respect
the
court's
previous
decisions
there
may
be
a
very
strong
presumption
that
precedents
should
stand
she
wrote
in
but
when
a
prior
decision
clearly
misinterprets
the
statutory
or
constitutional
provision
it
purports
to
interpret
judges
should
overrule
the
precedent
couple
that
declaration
with
ms
barrett's
favourable
even
fawning
view
of
mr
scalia's
jurisprudence
and
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
she
would
vote
to
uphold
roe
and
planned
parenthood
v
casey
a
decision
re-affirming
abortion
rights
in
an
article
in
in
the
notre
dame
law
review
ms
barrett
detailed
the
instances
when
mr
scalia
repeatedly
urged
the
overruling
of
roe
v
wade
and
closed
with
an
embrace
of
the
late
originalist
nothing
is
flawless
she
wrote
but
i
for
one
find
it
impossible
to
say
that
justice
scalia
did
his
job
badly
in
speeches
ms
barrett
shares
her
belief
that
life
begins
at
conception
as
a
circuit-court
judge
though
she
has
yet
to
brush
up
against
reproductive
rights
or
many
hot-button
controversies
she
has
mainly
seen
eye-to-eye
with
her
colleagues
of
the
opinions
she
has
written
on
three-judge
panels
only
three
have
been
dissents
all
but
three
of
her
majority
opinions
have
been
unanimous
but
on
the
few
occasions
where
she
has
departed
from
her
fellow
judges
or
inspired
a
colleague
to
dissent
ms
barrett
has
shown
flashes
of
strident
conservatism
in
may
she
took
a
narrower
view
of
a
criminal's
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
than
two
of
her
colleagues
the
seventh
circuit's
only
judges
appointed
by
democratic
presidents
in
february
she
took
another
hard
line
against
a
criminal
defendant
dissenting
from
a
ruling
for
a
convict
who
complained
that
the
state
had
withheld
evidence
favourable
to
his
case
in
march
ms
barrett
filed
a
forceful
page
dissent
from
a
judgment
against
a
wisconsin
felon
whose
crime
under
state
and
federal
law
barred
him
from
owning
a
gun
according
to
supreme
court
precedent
the
right
to
bear
arms
may
be
denied
to
dangerous
people
she
wrote
but
not
to
all
felons
since
there
is
no
evidence
that
disarming
all
non-violent
felons
does
much
good
and
the
criminal
in
question
showed
no
proclivity
for
violence
it
is
a
violation
of
the
second
amendment
to
strip
all
felons
of
their
firearms
ms
barrett's
expansive
view
of
gun
rights
juxtaposed
with
a
narrower
interpretation
of
immigrants
rights
puts
her
to
the
right
of
the
two
reagan
appointees
who
formed
the
majority
in
the
case
but
her
dissent
is
couched
in
dispassionate
straightforward
terms
with
none
of
the
barbs
that
often
spiked
mr
scalia's
opinions
and
are
now
popping
up
in
other
trump
appointees
rulings
in
the
view
of
ross
guberman
an
expert
on
legal
writing
ms
barrett's
prose
is
relentlessly
clear
and
logical
free
of
political
diatribes
and
betrays
little
that
would
pin
her
as
an
ideologue
there
may
be
method
to
her
caution
you'd
almost
think
mr
guberman
says
she
has
her
eye
on
a
higher
court
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
