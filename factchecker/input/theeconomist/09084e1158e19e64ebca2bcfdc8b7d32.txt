donald
trump
foreign-policy
showman
the
president's
frenetic
unstable
administration
has
created
stuck
policies
and
immovable
politics
july
th
could
not
come
a
day
too
soon
for
donald
trump
as
lexington
sat
down
to
write
the
president
was
finalising
plans
for
the
salute
to
america
pageant
he
had
dreamed
of
presiding
over
ever
since
witnessing
emmanuel
macron's
columns
of
armoured
cars
and
strapping
legionnaires
two
years
ago
tanks
planes
and
other
things
that
go
were
promised
plus
mr
trump
teased
by
tweet
an
address
by
your
favourite
president
me
trump
devotees
including
the
donors
and
other
cheerleaders
for
whom
a
section
of
the
national
mall
had
been
cordoned
off
were
in
for
a
treat
equally
delightful
for
the
president
his
critics
were
outraged
there
were
reports
that
m
in
national
park
receipts
had
been
siphoned
off
to
help
foot
the
jamboree's
bill
and
that
mr
trump's
tanks
could
damage
the
underground
vaults
of
the
lincoln
memorial
to
see
independence
day
being
so
politicised
was
sad
for
a
president
who
has
elevated
owning
the
libs
from
a
twitter
meme
to
a
governing
strategy
this
was
both
part
of
the
plan
and
a
timely
distraction
from
more
damning
events
mr
trump
has
issued
a
series
of
bold
foreign-policy
pledges
for
his
first
term
including
to
improve
america's
trade
with
china
deal
with
the
nuclear
threats
of
north
korea
and
iran
wind
down
the
war
in
afghanistan
pacify
the
middle
east
and
restore
order
to
america's
southern
border
and
it
has
become
apparent
in
a
recent
cascade
of
bad
news
for
his
dealmaking
ambitions
that
he
has
a
diminishing
chance
of
honouring
any
of
them
in
a
meeting
with
his
chinese
counterpart
at
the
g
summit
in
osaka
he
agreed
to
extend
trade
negotiations
with
china
but
only
after
making
concessions
including
the
reversal
of
his
decision
to
blacklist
huawei
a
chinese
telecoms
firm
his
administration
accuses
of
spying
president
xi
jinping
also
adopted
a
less
conciliatory
public
tone
than
he
had
before
the
two
leaders
previous
meeting
last
year
in
argentina
the
prospects
of
a
substantial
china
settlement
appear
remote
mr
trump's
subsequently
arranged
trip
to
meet
kim
jong
un
on
the
front-line
between
the
two
koreas
looked
like
an
effort
to
divert
attention
from
this
climb-down
his
korea
trip
in
turn
provided
a
reminder
that
despite
mr
trump's
affectionate
encouragement
mr
kim
has
taken
no
step
to
denuclearise
the
peninsula
nor
even
within
the
administration
is
he
expected
to
happily
for
mr
trump
the
much-criticised
efforts
of
his
daughter
ivanka
to
promote
herself
on
the
korean
front-line
provided
an
additional
diversion
ms
trump's
parading
for
the
cameras
was
the
distraction
from
the
main
distraction
the
list
goes
on
iran
said
this
week
that
it
had
stockpiled
more
than
kg
of
enriched
uranium
mr
trump
having
torn
up
its
promise
to
america
not
to
do
so
america's
negotiators
meanwhile
prepared
to
rejoin
peace
talks
with
the
taliban
in
the
absence
at
the
militants
insistence
of
any
representative
of
afghanistan's
elected
government
the
insurgents
are
also
stepping
up
attacks
across
the
country
if
mr
trump
goes
ahead
with
the
troop
withdrawal
he
claims
has
already
taken
place
he
risks
triggering
an
explosion
as
for
the
middle
east
better
not
ask
the
summit
in
bahrain
last
week
at
which
jared
kushner
unveiled
his
economic
blueprint
for
peace
was
a
farce
the
president
gave
it
a
wide
berth
no
plausible
palestinian
attended
which
leaves
the
border
and
this
may
be
mr
trump's
most
damaging
failure
of
all
despite
his
effort
to
push
mexico
into
deterring
border
crossings
they
are
soaring
which
is
dismaying
his
base
even
as
the
administration's
brutal
treatment
of
poor
migrants
angers
everyone
else
this
is
not
all
mr
trump's
fault
he
has
taken
on
major
problems
some
of
which
defeated
his
predecessors
and
on
china
and
afghanistan
especially
his
approach
has
been
novel
good
in
parts
and
may
yet
form
a
basis
for
progress
the
problem
is
his
relentless
divisiveness
hitherto
more
damaging
at
home
than
abroad
is
hurting
his
prospects
his
iran
north
korea
and
middle
east
polices
were
launched
largely
in
an
effort
to
repudiate
his
democratic
predecessor
this
has
encouraged
the
democrats
to
oppose
all
his
efforts
even
as
on
afghanistan
and
china
where
they
share
his
aims
that
partisan
schism
is
in
turn
encouraging
mr
trump's
foreign
counterparts
to
play
a
long-game
to
think
they
can
hold
out
for
better
terms
from
a
future
democratic
administration
or
that
such
an
administration
would
in
any
event
scrap
whatever
deals
mr
trump
might
have
done
the
only
way
the
president
looks
able
to
unlock
the
dramatic
progress
he
craves
on
any
of
these
fronts
would
be
by
making
further
concessions
for
example
by
agreeing
to
a
weak
trade
pact
with
china
or
a
replica
of
mr
obama's
iran
deal
yet
he
could
in
that
case
expect
a
backlash
from
within
his
own
party
marco
rubio
one
of
several
republican
senators
who
consider
foreign
policy
a
safe
space
from
which
to
criticise
the
president
called
the
concessions
on
huawei
a
catastrophic
mistake
this
reflects
a
broader
dilemma
for
mr
trump
because
he
now
has
little
prospect
of
expanding
his
support
beyond
the
large
minority
of
americans
who
are
not
offended
by
him
he
must
at
all
costs
keep
the
republican
coalition
together
he
is
therefore
constrained
by
politics
as
well
as
the
poor
progress
of
his
deal-making
efforts
both
are
stuck
the
daily
controversies
mr
trump
generates
including
this
week's
trump
show
on
the
steps
of
the
lincoln
memorial
are
meant
to
mask
that
reality
it
is
depressing
how
well
the
tactic
is
working
by
rising
to
the
daily
bait
mr
trump's
opponents
are
doing
as
he
is
whipping
up
their
supporters
without
in
any
way
impressing
the
other
side
to
be
fair
it
is
hard
not
to
be
thus
riled
the
controversies
mr
trump
stirs
including
over
his
politicising
of
independence
day
are
often
real
scandals
yet
his
critics
risk
losing
sight
of
his
actual
record
it
suggests
an
administration
that
is
less
unstable
than
many
believe
but
one
with
weak
support
and
signature
policies
fully
months
out
from
an
election
that
are
mostly
running
into
the
sand
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
