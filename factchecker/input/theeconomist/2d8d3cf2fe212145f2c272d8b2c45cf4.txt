a
full-court
press
the
prospect
of
another
trump
election
causes
an
unwarranted
panic
among
political
journalists
notwithstanding
the
help
he
got
from
fake
news
reports
donald
trump
probably
owes
his
presidency
more
to
the
traditional
kind
only
a
small
minority
of
voters
absorbed
made-up
accounts
of
hillary
clinton's
endorsement
by
islamic
state
lesbianism
and
links
to
a
child-sex
ring
yet
most
were
subject
indirectly
or
directly
to
an
incessant
drumbeat
of
negative
reporting
by
mainstream
outlets
such
as
the
new
york
times
washington
post
and
network
news
channels
on
the
democratic
candidate's
wooden
public
speaking
and
the
largely
confected
scandals
she
was
said
to
be
embroiled
in
in
a
multi-part
study
of
the
media's
role
in
the
election
thomas
patterson
of
harvard's
kennedy
school
of
government
found
that
mrs
clinton's
use
of
a
private
email
account
at
the
state
department
among
lesser
supposed
scandals
received
four
times
as
much
coverage
as
mr
trump's
alleged
record
of
harassing
women
that
unrelenting
focus
opened
the
gates
for
mr
trump's
wilder
attacks
on
his
opponent
it
also
helped
persuade
many
voters
who
had
initially
balked
at
the
republican's
character
that
the
two
candidates
were
comparably
flawed
if
everything
and
everyone
is
portrayed
negatively
there's
a
levelling
effect
that
opens
the
door
to
charlatans
wrote
mr
patterson
could
history
be
about
to
repeat
itself
hostile
coverage
of
joe
biden's
presidential
campaign
suggests
it
might
the
septuagenarian
former
vice-president
is
increasingly
coming
across
in
the
same
mainstream
outlets
as
outdated
forgetful
and
sloppy
with
the
truth
the
question
of
his
relative
fitness
for
mr
trump's
office
by
contrast
has
rarely
surfaced
last
month
an
inaccurate
account
mr
biden
gave
of
a
conversation
with
a
war
hero
in
which
he
conflated
exchanges
with
two
different
medal-winners
mashing
up
their
heroism
made
the
washington
post's
front
page
meanwhile
the
paper
consigned
to
page
ten
the
president's
use
of
a
crudely
doctored
government
map
to
try
to
justify
his
false
and
apparently
politically
motivated
insistence
that
alabama
lay
in
the
path
of
a
hurricane
such
coverage
will
exacerbate
an
existing
argument
among
left-leaning
journalists
and
academics
over
whether
america's
mainstream
journalistic
traditions
which
strive
for
non-partisanship
and
balance
can
handle
such
an
unconventional
figure
as
mr
trump
it
was
evident
in
the
leaked
transcript
of
a
meeting
of
the
new
york
times
newsroom
last
month
in
which
the
paper's
executive
editor
dean
baquet
fielded
criticism
from
reporters
who
wanted
to
call
the
president
a
racist
more
unambiguously
and
often
mr
baquet
pushed
back
because
as
a
native
of
the
segregated
south
he
said
the
word
lost
its
power
with
frequent
use
in
a
subsequent
interview
he
suggested
that
preserving
the
times's
hard-pressed
reputation
for
non-partisanship
was
another
concern
we
don't
want
to
change
all
our
structures
and
rules
so
much
that
we
can't
put
them
back
together
we
don't
want
to
be
oppositional
to
donald
trump
yet
that
is
what
many
left-wing
commentators
and
perhaps
a
good
few
in
mr
baquet's
newsroom
want
some
consider
the
risk
of
becoming
aligned
with
the
democratic
party
worth
running
in
an
effort
to
give
the
most
accurate
measure
of
mr
trump's
failings
others
just
want
to
be
aligned
with
it
either
out
of
political
conviction
or
as
nathan
robinson
of
current
affairs
magazine
has
argued
because
they
also
believe
the
increasing
strain
apparent
in
the
mainstream
outlets
claim
to
be
non-partisan
is
undermining
public
trust
in
them
only
by
being
more
upfront
about
their
leanings
as
the
republican
party
moves
to
the
right
and
their
newsrooms
to
the
left
it
is
argued
can
such
outlets
hope
to
restore
it
without
wishing
to
minimise
the
challenges
of
covering
american
politics
with
which
this
newspaper
also
grapples
not
always
successfully
these
arguments
should
be
dismissed
as
the
attempted
left-wing
power-grab
they
are
the
media
has
much
less
potential
to
give
mr
trump
an
unwarranted
advantage
over
his
opponent
next
year
than
it
had
in
the
election
is
likely
to
be
a
referendum
on
his
presidency
not
a
face-off
between
two
novel
candidates
and
most
voters
have
already
made
up
their
minds
on
that
this
is
not
ground
for
emergency
media
measures
americans
calamitous
loss
of
trust
is
also
fuelled
by
the
extreme
partisanship
that
has
made
their
politics
and
related
institutions
so
dysfunctional
the
fact
that
a
dwindling
number
of
mainstream
outlets
have
retained
readers
and
viewers
from
both
sides
of
the
divide
makes
them
despite
their
imperfections
the
closest
thing
to
a
neutral
arbiter
going
this
was
underlined
by
a
study
suggesting
mr
trump
performed
best
in
in
areas
with
the
lowest
levels
of
subscription
to
newspapers
whether
of
the
centre-left
or
centre-right
a
more
partisan
media
environment
is
the
last
thing
america
needs
those
who
doubt
that
should
consider
that
it
would
be
squarely
in
mr
trump's
interest
the
president's
attempt
to
gin
up
his
supporters
by
depicting
the
media
as
biased
is
one
of
his
most
powerful
lines
why
vindicate
it
for
him
retrofitting
american
political
journalism
to
defend
it
against
populists
to
which
mind
the
left
has
historically
been
as
susceptible
as
the
right
calls
for
more
modest
change
it
should
start
with
an
acknowledgment
that
the
country's
style
of
election
coverage
can
seem
frivolous
especially
compared
to
the
rigour
of
its
reporting
on
government
the
characteristic
features
including
an
obsessive
focus
on
the
candidate's
personality
and
details
of
the
campaign
especially
glitches
are
as
entertaining
as
any
soap-opera
but
rarely
useful
in
appraising
the
relative
merits
of
a
politician's
qualities
for
public
office
this
is
a
lesson
with
broad
application
mr
trump's
relentless
attacks
on
america's
institutions
have
by
and
large
done
damage
only
where
he
has
hit
on
some
pre-existing
weakness
for
those
who
would
defend
them
steely
self-criticism
may
be
more
effective
than
outrage
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
