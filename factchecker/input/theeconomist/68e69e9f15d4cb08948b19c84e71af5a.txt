alabama
the
remains
of
the
last
slave
ship
to
arrive
in
america
are
found
near
africatown
it
began
with
a
bet
timothy
meaher
a
rich
plantation
owner
thought
he
could
defy
a
decades-old
federal
ban
on
importing
africans
as
slaves
he
was
right
on
july
th
the
clotilda
a
two-masted
schooner
whose
journey
meaher
financed
docked
in
mobile
bay
it
was
the
last
ship
to
bring
enslaved
africans
to
america
less
than
five
years
after
its
arrival
the
union
defeated
the
confederacy
which
seceded
from
the
united
states
to
preserve
slavery
in
the
south
in
america's
civil
war
in
her
hold
were
about
men
women
and
children
who
survived
a
harrowing
journey
from
ouidah
a
notorious
slaving
port
in
what
is
today
benin
they
joined
the
roughly
of
alabama's
population
that
was
then
enslaved
to
escape
detection
the
captain
burned
and
sank
the
clotilda
in
the
bay
her
bones
lay
undiscovered
amid
mud
and
maritime
detritus
until
now
on
may
nd
the
alabama
historical
commission
announced
that
a
sunken
wreck
which
divers
and
archaeologists
had
been
examining
for
the
past
several
months
was
the
clotilda
nothing
in
the
wreck
bore
the
ship's
name
but
it
matches
construction
and
dimensional
details
gleaned
from
insurance
documents
the
metal
and
wood
match
historical
practice
and
it
appears
to
have
been
burned
what
happens
next
is
unclear
after
the
civil
war
ended
many
of
those
brought
to
america
on
the
clotilda
wanted
to
return
home
but
could
not
raise
enough
money
instead
they
bought
land
from
meaher
and
established
a
community
known
as
africatown
which
today
is
a
proud
but
poor
neighbourhood
in
northern
mobile
around
people
live
there
including
numerous
descendants
of
the
original
inhabitants
the
last
survivor

died
two
years
earlier
not
long
after
sitting
for
a
series
of
interviews
with
zora
neale
hurston
that
became

a
searing
biography
africatown
is
an
ageing
neighbourhood
sorely
lacking
in
private
businesses
many
hope
the
discovery
will
provide
a
much-needed
economic
boost
denizens
have
suggested
raising
the
wreck
and
building
a
museum
round
it
though
that
may
prove
difficult
the
ship
is
mostly
buried
and
the
surrounding
waters
are
alligator-ridden
and
dangerous
yet
the
discovery
itself
has
moved
africatown
residents
whatever
ultimately
comes
of
it
