america's
government
shutdown
is
an
act
of
economic
self-harm
its
costs
are
mounting
beer
brewers
are
facing
bottlenecks
airline
passengers
are
facing
queues
around
federal
employees
are
not
being
paid
these
are
the
casualties
of
america's
government
shutdown
which
began
on
december
st
and
is
now
the
longest
on
record
it
shows
few
signs
of
ending
its
costs
are
climbing
historically
such
shutdowns
seem
barely
to
have
budged
the
juggernaut
that
is
the
american
economy
economists
at
the
bureau
of
economic
analysis
bea
estimated
that
the
day
funding
lapse
in
october
lowered
real
gdp
growth
in
that
quarter
by
percentage
points
this
time
as
only
around
of
federal
employees
are
affected
most
estimates
of
the
weekly
impact
are
even
smaller
economists
at
moody's
a
rating
agency
reckon
that
for
each
week
it
continues
the
dent
to
gdp
growth
will
be
percentage
points
there
are
reasons
to
think
that
these
numbers
understate
the
impact
of
the
shutdown
kevin
hassett
chairman
of
the
trump
administration's
council
of
economic
advisers
said
on
january
th
that
after
taking
into
account
unpaid
government
contractors
his
officials
had
recently
doubled
their
estimates
to
a
hit
worth
percentage
points
per
week
congress
has
passed
legislation
to
ensure
that
federal
employees
receive
back
pay
although
the
government
will
have
to
pay
its
contractors
with
interest
once
the
shutdown
ends
in
the
past
many
of
those
companies
did
not
pass
the
cash
along
to
workers
another
caveat
is
that
these
figures
measure
the
economic
impact
of
the
shutdown
by
valuing
the
public
services
that
the
government
is
no
longer
paying
for
when
the
government
reopens
the
assumption
is
that
gdp
will
be
bumped
up
by
roughly
the
same
amount
it
was
depressed
by
with
few
lasting
effects
this
is
quite
a
narrow
view
of
the
impact
of
shutting
down
government
functions
that
support
other
economic
activity
the
closure
of
the
tax
and
trade
bureau
for
example
means
that
no
new
labels
for
nationally
distributed
beer
can
be
approved
creating
a
headache
for
john
laffler
of
off
color
an
illinois-based
brewer
he
wants
to
launch
a
new
beer
and
is
keen
to
package
it
as
soon
as
possible
he
could
gamble
pay
for
packaging
and
hope
that
the
approval
arrives
but
that
is
risky
as
there
is
no
knowing
what
the
regulators
will
approve
he
recalls
a
droopy-eyed
fish
being
rejected
demonic
ladies
dancing
with
goats
were
fine
a
wrong
decision
would
cost
him
money
beyond
beer
the

commission

stopped

th
reported
unscheduled
absences
at
a
national
rate
of
higher
than
the
rate
a
year
earlier
gummed-up
airports
cost
passengers
time
and
airlines
money
then
there
is
the
hardship
faced
by
workers
who
are
not
being
paid
in
past
shutdowns
the
impact
on
consumption
was
softened
as
people
expected
them
to
be
temporary
and
in
the
event
they
were
brief
this
one
has
lasted
longer
and
the
poorest
among
those
affected
may
not
have
savings
to
dip
into

thousands

regulators

necessary
but
such
services
are
unlikely
to
be
free
the
longer
the
shutdown
lasts
the
harder
it
will
be
to
escape
its

on

the

department
of
agriculture
is
handing
out
food
stamps
for
february
early
to
avoid
tens
of
millions
of
americans
going
without
that
month
if
such
loopholes
run
out
and
the
shutdown
extends
until
march
then
payments
for
food
stamps
worth
bn
per
month
will
cease
flowing
according
to
the
economists
at
moody's
that
alone
would
sap
gdp
by
bn
per
month
given
how
quickly
it
would
bite
into
spending
shutdowns
are
non-linear
one
that
lasts
twice
as
long
will
incur
more
than
twice

cost
