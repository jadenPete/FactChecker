adventures
with
long-shot
candidates
a
dispatch
from
the
iowa
state
fair
nearly
two
dozen
presidential
candidates
descended
on
iowa's
state
fair
which
began
on
august
th
each
with
a
different
style
and
number
of
supporters
elizabeth
warren's
were
young
loud
and
pre-loaded
with
chants
kamala
harris's
formed
a
yellow-shirted
fresh-faced
hyper-enthusiastic
wave
that
left
stickered
dazed-looking
iowans
in
its
wake
jay
inslee's
fan
club
comprised
channing
dutton
an
amiable
personal-injury
lawyer
from
des
moines
who
held
up
a
home-made
sign
that
read
talk
climate
referring
to
mr
inslee's
signature
issue
mr
inslee
served
eight
terms
in
congress
and
is
in
his
second
as
washington's
governor
where
he
has
enacted
a
democratic
wish-list
of
policies
including
a
moratorium
on
capital
punishment
expanded
parental
leave
and
an
impressively
detailed
path
to
clean
energy
by
he
is
tall
square-jawed
handsome
and
married
to
his
high-school
sweetheart
yet
he
has
struggled
in
a
crowded
field
and
is
polling
below
both
nationally
and
in
iowa
in
fact
just
three
candidates
ms
warren
ms
harris
and
joe
biden
are
polling
in
double
digits
in
the
state
nationally
ms
harris
drops
to
in
the
economist's
average
of
polls
while
bernie
sanders
is
at
a
bit
lower
in
iowa
sixteen
candidates
are
bumbling
along
at
thus
there
were
two
contests
playing
out
at
the
fair
four
or
five
front-runners
fought
to
be
top
dog
while
the
rest
fought
for
a
bit
of
attention
for
some
that
was
hard
to
come
by
mike
schweiger
a
lean
white-haired
electrician
wearing
a
t-shirt
emblazoned
with
the
name
of
his
union
said
he
supports
ms
warren
because
she
talks
about
the
need
for
a
union
resurgence
and
that's
my
issue
it's
not
abortion
not
the
influx
of
aliens
that
will
bring
back
the
middle
class
as
he
was
explaining
himself
tim
ryan
a
congressman
from
youngstown
ohio
and
a
fervent
union
advocate
was
on
stage
just
a
few
feet
away
mr
schweiger
said
he
had
never
heard
of
mr
ryan
his
wife
asked
if
he
was
the
one
who
ran
with
hillary
clinton
that
was
tim
kaine
every
time
a
poll
comes
out
and
i'm
at
i
think
oh
my
god
in
the
next
one
am
i
going
to
be
at
says
john
hickenlooper
a
former
governor
of
colorado
who
is
stuck
on
mr
hickenlooper
touts
his
record
of
bipartisan
achievement
i'm
the
only
candidate
who
does
what
everyone
talks
about
he
tells
reporters
after
his
speech
his
omnipresent
smile
hardening
into
a
rictus
if
i
keep
saying
it
often
enough
it'll
get
through
their
heads
there
is
still
time
to
say
it
often
enough
iowa's
caucuses
in
february
are
the
primary
season's
first
contest
winners
do
not
always
capture
their
party's
nomination
as
tom
harkin
mike
huckabee
and
ted
cruz
can
attest
but
a
poor
performance
can
end
a
campaign
some
democrats
grumble
about
the
size
of
the
field
but
short
of
running
out
of
money
no
candidate
yet
has
a
strong
enough
incentive
to
drop
out
the
field
is
more
open
than
it
seems
mr
biden
holds
a
comfortable
lead
but
he
is
gaffe-prone
and
would
take
office
at
which
would
make
him
the
oldest
man
to
do
so
his
performances
on
the
trail
have
been
meandering
and
unimpressive
he
seems
to
inspire
more
affection
than
genuine
enthusiasm
if
he
begins
leaking
support
every
other
candidate
wants
to
be
there
with
a
bucket
still
short
of
an
incredible
run
of
luck
none
of
the
stragglers
seems
likely
to
break
through
as
long
as
the
field
remains
so
crowded
mr
dutton
believes
that
mr
inslee
is
a
wildfire
just
waiting
for
a
spark
but
asked
what
that
spark
might
be
he
is
circumspect
if
i
knew
i'd
light
it
myself
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
