real
criminal-justice
reform
is
local
and
not
easy
a
few
prosecutors
offer
lessons
for
political
candidates
after
dan
conley
announced
last
year
that
he
would
not
seek
re-election
as
the
district
attorney
da
for
suffolk
county
massachusetts
which
includes
boston
and
a
few
surrounding
towns
five
democrats
and
an
independent
vied
to
replace
him
mr
conley
endorsed
greg
henning
who
worked
for
him
for
ten
years
mr
henning
also
received
endorsements
and
plenty
of
campaign
contributions
from
local
police
unions
such
support
usually
creates
a
glide-path
to
victory
in
this
case
it
did
not
mr
henning
lost
to
rachael
rollins
one
of
a
wave
of
das
trying
to
reform
the
criminal-justice
system
from
within
ms
rollins
has
identified
charges
including
shoplifting
receiving
stolen
property
drug
possession
and
trespassing
best
addressed
through
diversion
or
declined
for
prosecution
entirely
her
office
requests
cash
bail
only
when
the
accused
is
a
flight
risk
she
has
created
a
panel
that
includes
a
defence
lawyer
and
a
public-health
expert
to
review
all
fatal
shootings
by
police
these
positions
are
all
unusual
for
an
elected
da
traditionally
the
toughest-on-crime
candidate
wins
but
the
american
conversation
on
criminal
justice
is
changing
ms
rollins
may
be
in
the
vanguard
but
she
is
not
alone
her
companions
come
from
both
parties
for
years
right
on
crime
an
advocacy
campaign
run
by
the
conservative
texas
public
policy
foundation
and
the
american
conservative
union
foundation
has
advanced
conservative
arguments
for
criminal-justice
reform
the
trump
administration's
only
significant
bipartisan
legislative
achievement
has
been
passing
the
first
step
act
championed
by
jared
kushner
donald
trump's
adviser
and
son-in-law
that
bill
passed
in
december
among
other
things
banned
the
shackling
of
pregnant
prisoners
and
made
thousands
of
prisoners
eligible
for
early
release
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
sought
to
build
on
this
momentum
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
have
released
particularly
ambitious
reform
plans
aimed
at
reducing
mass
incarceration
but
much
of
what
they
propose
will
either
not
work
or
be
impossible
without
democrats
taking
control
of
both
houses
of
congress
which
seems
unlikely
mr
sanders
for
example
wants
to
spend
bn
a
year
on
public
defence
lawyers
that
is
an
admirable
idea
but
one
that
a
republican-controlled
senate
is
unlikely
to
approve
ms
warren
wants
to
repeal
most
of
the
crime
bill
which
increased
incarceration
rates
but
one
of
the
ways
it
did
that
was
by
incentivising
states
to
pass
truth
in
sentencing
laws
which
require
prisoners
to
serve
at
least
of
their
sentences
repealing
a
federal
bill
will
not
change
those
state-level
laws
both
candidates
want
to
ban
private
prisons
but
say
nothing
about
prison-guards
unions
which
are
more
effective
drivers
of
mass
incarceration
the
work
being
done
by
das
like
ms
rollins
show
how
real
criminal-justice
reform
can
be
achieved
the
primary
lesson
is
that
reform
produces
resistance
kevin
graham
who
heads
the
police
union
in
chicago
home
to
kim
foxx
another
reformist
prosecutor
says
he
does
not
believe
that
a
prosecutor
is
going
to
achieve
social
justice
in
america
the
job
of
a
prosecutor
is
to
prosecute
people
we
have
defence
attorneys
if
we
choose
not
to
prosecute
then
the
laws
don't
mean
anything
others
think
that
ms
rollins
is
making
decisions
that
should
be
left
to
legislatures
if
your
idea
is
to
basically
decriminalise
certain
statutes
run
for
your
state
general
assembly
says
duffie
stone
a
prosecutor
who
heads
the
national
district
attorneys
association
ms
rollins
replies
that
her
predecessors
often
declined
to
prosecute
low-level
cases
she
just
made
practice
into
policy
and
that
policy
is
not
absolute
she
distinguishes
between
three
hypothetical
trespassers
a
homeless
person
sleeping
on
public
property
someone
who
falls
asleep
while
high
in
a
city
hospital
and
a
violent
felon
caught
with
a
gun
outside
his
ex-girlfriend's
house
the
first
two
she
argues
need
help
not
a
criminal
record
the
third
deserves
the
charge
in
a
speech
to
police
officers
on
august
th
william
barr
the
attorney-general
derided
anti-law-enforcement
das
who
refuse
to
enforce
broad
swathes
of
criminal
law
most
disturbing
is
that
some
are
refusing
to
prosecute
cases
of
resisting
police
as
it
happens
resisting
arrest
when
not
combined
with
more
serious
charges
is
on
ms
rollins's
do-not-prosecute
list
here
too
she
draws
a
distinction
if
you're
charged
with
armed
robbery
and
resisting
arrest
that's
very
different
than
a
stand-alone
resisting-arrest
charge
which
is
often
just
you've
pissed
this
police
officer
off
annoying
a
police
officer
may
not
be
good
practice
but
it
is
not
a
crime
the
results
of
ms
rollins's
approach
mr
barr
warns
will
be
predictable
more
crime
more
victims
most
reformist
prosecutors
have
not
been
in
office
long
enough
to
tell
but
ms
rollins
does
not
pretend
to
be
a
fortune-teller
like
many
reformers
she
has
invested
in
data
her
department
has
hired
a
technologist
to
update
the
creaky
computer
system
and
she
promises
to
be
responsive
to
it
if
my
policies
through
data
show
things
are
getting
worse
why
in
god's
name
would
i
want
to
make
anything
worse
than
it
is
and
if
the
boston
patrolmen's
association
wants
to
say
see
we
told
you
i'm
going
to
say
you're
right
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
