democrats
push
for
washington
dc
to
become
the
st
state
republicans
unsurprisingly
are
less
keen
four
years
ago
alan
amsterdam
co-authored
a
ballot
initiative
that
made
it
legal
to
own
use
and
grow
marijuana
in
america's
capital
as
an
investor
in
the
dope
trade
the
aptly-named
mr
amsterdam
co-owns
capitol
hemp
a
shop
that
flogs
bongs
and
pipes
he
had
a
strong
private
motive
the
referendum
passed
yet
it
remains
illegal
to
sell
weed
in
washington
and
though
marijuana
peddlers
tend
to
get
around
that
by
overpricing
other
goods
and
throwing
a
pungent-smelling
gift
into
the
bargain
this
requirement
remains
a
serious
dampener
on
mr
amsterdam's
business
washington
is
one
of
the
most-visited
places
in
america
he
notes
with
frustration
a
lot
of
that
is
kids
going
to
museums
but
think
what
their
parents
would
like
to
do
in
the
evening
the
fact
that
washingtonians
are
free
to
smoke
marijuana
but
not
buy
it
is
a
reflection
of
their
peculiar
political
circumstance
because
america's
founders
did
not
want
a
state
government
to
exercise
undue
influence
over
the
capital
they
made
the
district
of
columbia
a
federal
jurisdiction
more
than
two
centuries
later
its
odd
residents
more
americans
than
live
in
wyoming
or
vermont
have
no
voting
representation
in
congress
and
their
city
budget
must
be
approved
by
congressmen
after
the
ballot
initiative
was
passed
a
congressional
rider
was
attached
to
dc's
budget
forbidding
officials
from
spending
federal
or
local
funds
to
legalise
or
regulate
the
market
such
meddling
by
lawmakers
in
the
city's
affairs
is
one
reason
why
fresh
momentum
is
gathering
behind
a
movement
for
dc
statehood
in
march
the
house
of
representatives
passed
the
for
the
people
act
a
long
list
of
measures
to
expand
voting
access
that
includes
a
statement
of
support
for
the
statehood
effort
in
the
senate
a
similar
bill
is
backed
by
the
many
democrats
there
who
are
running
for
the
presidency
on
april
th
democratic
attorneys-general
from
california
to
virginia
said
in
a
statement
the
first
of
its
kind
that
they
backed
the
push
for
dc
statehood
democrats
support
for
the
movement
is
in
part
principled
nearly
half
of
the
population
is
african-american
in
worries
about
the
disenfranchisement
of
black
americans
led
to
a
constitutional
amendment
allowing
district
residents
to
vote
in
presidential
elections
democrats
remain
exercised
by
such
concerns
it
is
also
self-interested
since
district
dwellers
won
the
right
to
pick
presidents
they
have
plumped
for
democrats
by
big
margins
in
hillary
clinton
took
more
than
of
dc's
vote
republicans
are
understandably
less
anxious
for
dc
to
get
its
own
congressmen
and
senators
even
if
statehood
did
not
require
a
constitutional
amendment
which
three-quarters
of
states
would
have
to
back
this
means
dc
is
unlikely
to
become
america's
st
state
any
time
soon
