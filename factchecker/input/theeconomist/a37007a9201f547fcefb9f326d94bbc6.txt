what
budget
cuts
during
the
great
recession
did
to
pupils
test
scores
a
flurry
of
recent
research
points
to
a
clear
conclusion
lawmakers
sometimes
cut
education
budgets
in
the
hope
of
forcing
schools
to
become
more
efficient
given
the
difficulty
of
measuring
the
effects
of
education
spending
on
test
scores
it
can
be
hard
to
know
whether
this
is
as
bad
an
idea
as
at
first
glance
it
might
seem
to
be
yet
america
ran
a
large
albeit
unintended
experiment
along
these
lines
in
when
school
budgets
were
cut
during
the
recession
what
happened
to
the
pupils
according
to
a
study
by
kirabo
jackson
of
northwestern
university
and
his
colleagues
recession-era
budget
cuts
did
lead
to
lower
maths
and
reading
scores
imagine
that
a
school
district
replaced
all
its
average
teachers
with
near-bottom-quality
teachers
mr
jackson
says
that
the
recession
had
a
similar
effect
on
pupil
scores
the
researchers
also
found
that
the
budget
cuts
during
the
recession
reduced
graduation
rates
a
reduction
in
spending
per-pupil
in
all
four
years
of
high
school
reduced
the
likelihood
of
a
student
graduating
by
percentage
points
america's
public
schools
are
paid
for
with
a
combination
of
federal
state
and
local
funding
most
state
revenue
comes
from
personal-income
and
general
sales
taxes
which
decreased
during
the
recession
when
m
jobs
were
lost
wealthier
districts
can
depend
on
local
property
taxes
to
fund
schools
during
economic
downturns
but
poorer
districts
mostly
rely
on
state
funds
as
a
result
poor
schools
that
depended
heavily
on
state
revenue
faced
the
largest
budget
cuts
since
children
from
racial
minorities
disproportionately
attend
low-income
schools
they
endured
the
brunt
of
the
consequences
test
scores
in
poor
and
minority
school
districts
suffered
most
according
to
kenneth
shores
of
pennsylvania
state
university
and
matthew
steinberg
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
the
schools
hit
hardest
by
budget
cuts
were
already
struggling
academically
and
financially
although
the
cuts
may
have
led
some
schools
to
trim
otherwise
wasteful
spending
mr
jackson
and
colleagues
found
that
many
schools
were
forced
to
cut
funding
of
core
activities
one
of
the
most
noticeable
effects
was
on
class
size
william
n.
evans
of
notre
dame
university
and
his
co-authors
found
that
nearly
school
personnel
mostly
teachers
lost
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
the
recession
salaries
and
employee
benefits
make
up
approximately
of
school
expenditures
per
pupil
so
they
are
often
the
first
cuts
made
when
budgets
tighten
small
class
sizes
improve
test
scores
future
college
attendance
and
future
job
quality
the
cuts
increased
class
sizes
in
schools
that
already
had
the
poorest
test
scores
the
lowest
college
attendance
rates
and
the
worst
employment
rates
according
to
the
centre
on
budget
and
policy
priorities
a
think-tank
states
had
not
returned
to
pre-recession
funding
levels
by
rebecca
sibilia
of
edbuild
a
non-profit
organisation
that
advocates
more
equal
funding
for
schools
reckons
that
funding
cuts
during
the
recession
provide
one
of
the
clearest
examples
of
how
current
school-funding
formulas
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
children
who
need
most
help
she
recommends
changing
the
system
for
example
by
redrawing
school
districts
so
that
they
are
more
equal
this
would
require
wealthier
places
with
higher
property
taxes
to
share
their
funds
with
needier
schools
within
the
same
district
however
redistricting
is
unlikely
since
more
than
wealthy
neighbourhoods
have
agitated
to
secede
from
school
districts
in
an
attempt
to
hoard
resources
of
those
were
successful
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
