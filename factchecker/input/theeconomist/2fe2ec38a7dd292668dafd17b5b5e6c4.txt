brian

an
oregon
state
senator
and
fugitive
of
sorts
does
not
take
his
pursuers
lightly
send
bachelors
and
come
heavily
armed
he
warned
from
his
hideout
which
is
allegedly
in
idaho
i'm
not
going
to
be
a
political
prisoner
in
the

of
oregon
he
added
since
june
th
mr
boquist
and
the
rest
of
his
republican
colleagues
in
the
state
senate
have
fled
from
the
capitol
in
salem
as
part
a
final
effort
to
derail
a
climate-change
bill
kate
brown
the
democratic
governor
who
is
keen
to
sign
the
bill
has
invoked
her
constitutional
authority
to
haul
the
absentee
lawmakers
back
thus
giving
democrats
a
quorum
threats
from
armed
militias
then
forced
the
closure
of
the
capitol
altogether
when
the
western
stand-off
subsides
oregon
may
emerge
as
the
latest
state
to
pass
ambitious
emissions-reductions
legislation
in
this
case
a
cap-and-trade
programme
for
carbon
pollution
new
york
is
poised
to
approve
its
own
ambitious
climate
targets
carbon-free
electricity
by
and
a
carbon-neutral
economy
by
a
long
line
of
states
including
colorado
washington
and
new
mexico
have
already
enacted
clean-energy
laws
this
year
all
this
as
federal
environmental
policy
languishes
under
an
administration
that
denies
climate
change
is
a
problem
worth
tackling
and
is
keen
to
undo
regulations
aimed
at
slowing
it
down
more
and
more
states
are
following
california
which
began
instituting
stringent
environmental
rules
decades
ago
rigorous
efficiency
standards
for
appliances
businesses
and
vehicles
have
brought
the
golden
state's
emissions
down
from
to
california's
emissions
fell
by
even
as
its
economy
and
population
grew
since
renewable-energy
standards
which
mandate
that
a
steadily
increasing
percentage
of
electricity
must
come
from
renewable
sources
have
spurred
innovations
and
since
the
state
has
had
a
cap-and-trade
programme
which
prices
carbon
by
capping
maximum
emissions
this
scheme
covers
of
total
greenhouse-gas
emissions
the
current
price
of
a
metric
ton
of
carbon
dioxide
is
sizeable
but
less
than
the
total
cost
of
carbon
pollution
which
is
estimated
to
be
about
per
metric
ton
so
far
the
specific
contribution
of
the
cap-and-trade
scheme
to
emissions
reductions
is
hard
to
measure
says
dallas
burtraw
of
resources
for
the
future
who
chairs
the
programme's
market
advisory
committee
but
it
should
become
more
important
as
the
cap
tightens
and
prices
rise
for
the
newer
members
of
the
green-state
coalition
policies
vary
greatly
on
the
west
coast
plans
are
fairly
detailed
jay
inslee
the
governor
of
washington
state
who
is
running
a
long-shot
bid
for
president
on
a
climate-centred
agenda
signed
a
bill
in
may
which
would
make
the
state's
energy
supply
coal-free
by
washington
which
already
makes
much
use
of
hydroelectric
power
plans
to
accomplish
this
by
reorganising
power
generation
the
plan
goes
further
though
the
state's
energy
supplies
must
be
carbon-neutral
by
a
year
which
is
not
so
far
away
and
carbon-free
by
states
like
washington
with
democratic
legislatures
and
governors
have
gravitated
more
towards
renewable
targets
and
clean-energy
subsidies
than
to
outright
carbon-pricing
twice
during
mr
inslee's
six
years
in
office
washingtonians
have
rejected
carbon
taxes
by
referendum
mr
inslee
blames
the
oil
and
gas
industry
that
had
not
yet
come
to
terms
with
this
need
for
transition
carbon
taxes
though
much
touted
by
economists
have
never
been
popular
with
voters
if
not
thwarted
by
fleeing
republican
lawmakers
oregon's
plan
would
take
account
of
that
aversion
its
centrepiece
is
a
cap-and-trade
programme
like
california's
which
could
eventually
be
integrated
into
the
same
regional
electricity
market
it
aims
to
reduce
emissions
levels
to
below
levels
by
and
to
below
by
for
a
small
state
to
implement
a
cap-and-trade
scheme
on
its
own
is
a
tricky
proposition
businesses
may
find
it
hard
to
leave
california
if
energy
prices
rise
but
can
more
easily
spurn
smaller
places
administrative
costs
are
higher
for
a
smaller
carbon
market
as
is
the
chance
of
major
disruptions
new
york's
approach
is
different
both
because
its
targets
are
so
ambitious
and
because
the
methods
for
achieving
them
are
unclear
the
state
was
already
awash
with
regulations
and
programmes
to
support
cleaner
power
such
as
solar
and
offshore
wind
farms
the
new
bill
which
andrew
cuomo
the
governor
is
expected
to
sign
into
law
strengthens
them
it
includes
a
binding
goal
to
achieve
of
electricity
generation
through
renewables
by
by
all
power
would
need
to
be
emissions-free
by
the
entire
new
york
economy
would
need
to
have
emissions
below
levels
the
remaining
would
need
to
be
offset
for
instance
through
carbon-capture
technology
legislators
declined
to
get
into
the
details
bestowing
that
task
on
a
new
climate
action
council
that
must
create
recommendations
kathryn
wylde
the
head
of
the
partnership
for
new
york
city
a
business
group
says
she
supports
efforts
to
fight
climate
change
but
is
wary
of
the
looming
practical
challenge
supplying
enough
energy
to
new
york
city
when
a
giant
nuclear
plant
shuts
down
last
month
the
state
rejected
a
new
natural-gas
pipeline
which
opponents
had
said
would
undermine
new
york's
climate
goals
state
efforts
have
speeded
up
in
response
to
the
intransigence
of
the
trump
administration
since
massachusetts
v
epa
a
supreme
court
ruling
issued
in
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
has
been
legally
required
to
regulate
carbon-dioxide
emissions
which
the
ruling
classified
as
a
dangerous
pollutant
under
barack
obama
the
agency
adopted
far-reaching
regulation
known
as
the
clean
power
plan
which
targeted
reductions
in
emissions
from
electricity
generation
by
phasing
out
coal
the
rule
was
tied
up
in
the
courts
and
never
went
into
effect
last
week
president
donald
trump
finalised
its
replacement
the
strangely
named
affordable
clean
energy
ace
rule
this
will
not
resuscitate
the
coal
industry
as
mr
trump
claims
but
any
future
democratic
president
would
find
that
undoing
it
will
require
another
lengthy
rule-making
process
which
will
take
several
years
the
ace
rule
might
also
prove
to
be
a
headache
for
the
owners
of
power
stations
in
part
because
of
its
poor
drafting
the
trump
administration
is
also
trying
to
delay
fuel-economy
standards
for
cars
put
in
place
by
the
obama
administration
and
is
tussling
with
california
over
its
ability
to
set
even
higher
standards
carmakers
who
are
the
alleged
beneficiaries
of
the
proposal
are
lukewarm
or
outrightly
opposed
to
the
idea
oil
producers
however
are
elated
this
is
despite
frequent
pronouncements
from
the
current
epa
on
the
virtues
of
co-operative
federalism
in
environmental
policy
and
the
undesirability
of
dictating
one-size-fits-all
mandates
from
washington
that
outlook
seems
to
apply
more
when
states
are
racing
to
get
rid
of
regulations
than
when
they
are
trying
to
add
more
america
accounts
for
of
global
emissions
the
states
and
cities
passing
ambitious
climate-change
programmes
account
for
a
fraction
of
this
fraction
emissions
have
declined
from
historical
levels
in
america
due
simply
to
costs
natural
gas
has
become
cheaper
and
the
cost
of
renewables
has
dropped
significantly
in
the
past
decade
the
cost
of
wind
energy
has
fallen
by
while
that
of
solar
energy
has
dropped
by
more
than
states
and
cities
can
depress
this
national
trajectory
a
bit
further
a
bifurcated
country
in
which
prosperous
democratic
states
with
hefty
environmental
rules
go
one
way
and
republican-leaning
states
go
another
is
not
ideal
but
state
programmes
will
generate
valuable
know-how
before
the
rest
of
the
country
moves
says
severin
borenstein
an
economist
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
they
will
also
provide
an
example
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
study
china
accounts
for
nearly
twice
as
many
greenhouse-gas
emissions
as
america
chinese
bureaucrats
have
dropped
in
on
california
to
inspect
its
programme
many
times
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
