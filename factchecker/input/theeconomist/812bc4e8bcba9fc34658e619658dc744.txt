why
america's
real-estate
brokers
are
such
a
rip-off
selling
a
house
in
the
united
states
is
extremely
expensive
the
past
decade
has
not
been
great
for
middlemen
who
match
buyers
and
sellers
for
a
slice
of
the
transaction
value
travel
agents
have
had
their
margins
crushed
by
flight-search
and
hotel-booking
websites
stockbrokers
have
been
squeezed
out
by
whizzy
algorithms
that
carry
out
transactions
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
taxi
dispatchers
have
been
replaced
by
uber
and
lyft
there
is
an
exception
however
even
though
there
are
plenty
of
sites
like
zillow
and
redfin
which
offer
home-buyers
in
america
the
chance
to
search
for
properties
commission
rates
for
real-estate
brokers
estate
agents
in
britain
have
not
fallen
much
staying
close
to
for
the
buyer's
agent
for
the
seller's
americans
pay
twice
as
much
as
people
in
most
other
developed
markets
where
similar
sites
have
done
much
to
depress
residential-property
transaction
fees
see
chart
this
irks
many
why
is
it
that
residential
real-estate
brokers
fees
are
two
to
three
times
higher
in
the
us
than
in
any
other
developed
country
in
the
world
asks
jack
ryan
who
founded
rex
homes
a
property
brokerage
that
offers
to
sell
homes
for
just
commission
he
believes
the
problem
lies
in
the
anti-competitive
practices
of
the
multiple
listing
service
mls
through
which
nearly
every
broker
in
america
lists
and
searches
for
homes
and
the
national
association
of
realtors
nar
a
trade
association
with
m
broker
members
in
america
which
regulates
it
that
opinion
is
growing
in
popularity
two
class-action
lawsuits
have
been
filed
against
the
nar
and
some
of
the
largest
real-estate
brokerages
such
as
realogy
and
keller
williams
in
america
a
practice
called
tying
is
common
whereby
home-sellers
are
forced
to
agree
upfront
on
the
rate
they
will
pay
the
buyer's
broker
the
lawsuits
allege
that
sellers
brokers
put
pressure
on
homeowners
to
offer
the
industry
standard
of
if
they
refuse
buyers
brokers
may
refuse
to
show
their
home
to
clients
this
is
possible
because
of
the
mls
in
april
the
department
of
justice
doj
began
to
subpoena
information
about
how
brokers
use
the
system
looking
for
evidence
that
they
search
for
homes
by
commission
rate
if
found
it
would
corroborate
the
idea
that
buyers
brokers
invariably
steer
buyers
to
homes
that
offer
the
juiciest
commission
the
nar
moved
to
dismiss
both
suits
in
early
august
john
smaby
the
president
of
the
national
association
of
realtors
says
the
lawsuits
are
wrong
on
the
facts
wrong
on
the
economics
and
wrong
on
the
law
but
the
market
seems
to
think
there
is
plenty
to
worry
about
many
large
real-estate
brokerages
are
privately
held
but
the
share
price
of
realogy
one
of
the
brokerages
named
in
the
suit
has
fallen
by
half
since
the
end
of
april
just
after
news
of
the
doj
investigation
leaked
the
value
of
re
max
another
listed
brokerage
has
fallen
over
the
same
period
if
transaction
fees
are
being
kept
artificially
high
by
these
practices
that
is
bad
news
for
homeowners
some
trn
worth
of
homes
change
hands
every
year
if
anticompetitive
practices
are
elevating
american
brokerage
fees
by
two
to
three
percentage
points
above
where
they
might
be
otherwise
this
is
costing
consumers
as
much
as
bn
per
year
or
of
gdp
the
costs
to
the
american
economy
are
probably
higher
than
that
when
moving
house
is
so
expensive
many
people
may
not
bother
that
means
less
spending
on
services
associated
with
moving
home
such
as
gardening
and
decorating
worse
it
may
also
be
suppressing
mobility
in
america
ben
harris
who
was
the
chief
economist
for
joe
biden
when
he
was
vice-president
argues
that
average
incomes
in
poorer
cities
are
not
catching
up
with
those
in
rich
ones
in
part
because
people
aren't
moving
any
more
extortionate
real-estate
commissions
are
hardly
the
only
problem
wealthy
cities
such
as
san
francisco
need
to
build
new
housing
if
people
are
to
move
to
better-paying
jobs
there
but
they
certainly
do
not
help
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
