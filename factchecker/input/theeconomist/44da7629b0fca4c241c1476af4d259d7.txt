america
is
turning
against
facial-recognition
software
but
that
isn't
the
most
promising
use
of
technology
the
salesmen
and
women
at
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
technology
conference
last
week
were
as
enthusiastic
as
ever
this
in-car
tablet
had
a
tougher
coating
and
less
intrusive
bezel
that
radar
gun
had
a
clearer
display
and
a
faster
processor
but
conference
veterans
noted
the
lack
of
truly
ground-breaking
gear
attitudes
to
police
technology
are
changing
not
only
among
american
civilians
but
among
the
cops
themselves
until
recently
americans
seemed
willing
to
let
police
deploy
new
technologies
in
the
name
of
public
safety
as
they
saw
fit
but
crime
is
much
rarer
than
it
was
in
the
s
and
technological
scepticism
is
growing
on
may
th
san
francisco
became
the
first
american
city
to
ban
its
agencies
from
using
facial-recognition
systems
that
decision
was
profoundly
unpopular
at
the
police
conference
jack
marks
who
manages
panasonic's
public-safety
products
called
it
short-sighted
and
reactive
the
technology
exists
he
said
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
help
shape
it
other
cities
including
somerville
in
massachusetts
may
soon
follow
san
francisco's
lead
all
the
same
companies
are
under
scrutiny
too
on
may
nd
amazon
saw
off
two
challenges
by
activist
shareholders
they
wanted
the
board
to
commission
an
independent
study
to
determine
whether
rekognition
its
facial-recognition
platform
imperils
civil
human
and
privacy
rights
the
activists
also
wanted
to
ban
the
firm
from
selling
rekognition
to
governments
until
the
company's
board
concludes
after
an
evaluation
using
independent
evidence
that
it
does
not
erode
those
rights
senior
police
officers
argue
that
the
technology
is
a
useful
crime-fighting
tool
daniel
steeves
chief
information
officer
for
the
ottawa
police
service
says
that
a
robbery-investigation
unit
spent
six
months
testing
a
facial-recognition
system
it
lowered
the
average
time
required
for
an
officer
to
identify
a
subject
from
an
image
from
days
to
three
minutes
the
officers
could
simply
run
an
image
through
a
database
of
mugshot
photos
rather
than
leafing
through
them
manually
or
sending
a
picture
to
the
entire
department
and
asking
if
anybody
recognised
the
suspect
other
officers
stress
that
a
facial-recognition
match
never
establishes
guilt
it
is
just
a
lead
to
be
investigated
yet
officers
sense
that
the
technology
is
in
bad
odour
a
deputy
police
chief
from
an
american
suburb
with
a
security
system
that
uses
facial
recognition
around
the
local
high
school
says
we
knew
that
facial
recognition
wasn't
going
to
fly
so
we
called
it
an
early
warning
detection
system
many
distinguish
between
the
sort
of
facial-recognition
software
that
mr
steeves's
department
used
which
matches
suspects
to
mugshots
already
in
a
police
database
to
the
more
widely
feared
version
used
in
china
for
instance
that
blankets
cities
with
cameras
that
employ
facial
recognition
and
monitors
citizens
accused
of
no
crime
others
think
the
distinction
less
clear-cut
matt
cagle
a
lawyer
with
the
american
civil
liberties
union
of
northern
california
fears
that
facial
recognition
is
vulnerable
to
mission-creep
and
growth
even
a
system
like
the
one
in
ottawa
requires
building
a
database
that
could
be
used
for
less
ethical
purposes
testifying
before
congress
on
may
nd
clare
garvie
a
facial-recognition
expert
at
georgetown
law's
centre
on
privacy
and
technology
argued
that
because
facial
recognition
can
subject
people
to
persistent
secret
surveillance
it
presents
a
unique
threat
to
our
civil
rights
and
liberties
ms
garvie's
research
has
found
that
conservatively
half
of
all
americans
have
their
faces
in
databases
to
which
the
police
can
get
access
often
the
image
is
a
drivers
licence
photo
she
also
noted
that
the
technology
is
bad
at
identifying
non-white
faces
sometimes
scepticism
about
technology
comes
from
the
cops
earlier
this
year
the
washington
post
reported
that
many
small
police
departments
were
abandoning
body-worn-camera
programmes
because
of
the
cost
although
the
cameras
are
cheap
officers
can
generate
gigabytes
of
video
per
shift
storage
costs
mount
police
unions
often
oppose
body-worn
cameras
fearing
they
imperil
their
members
by
giving
superior
officers
licence
to
search
them
for
punishable
behaviour
other
officers
complain
about
the
amount
of
time
required
to
review
and
redact
footage
in
response
to
public-information
requests
they
also
seem
not
to
work
a
study
from
george
mason
university
released
in
march
found
that
body-worn
cameras
had
no
statistically
significant
or
consistent
effects
on
people's
views
on
police
or
on
police
or
civilian
behaviour
none
of
this
means
that
policing
will
become
less
technologically
sophisticated
however
even
as
the
public
and
the
police
turn
against
some
visible
technologies
other
ones
are
quietly
being
deployed
the
most
important
innovations
are
invisible
to
most
citizens
police
have
long
gathered
immense
amounts
of
data
but
have
not
always
organised
them
well
police
complain
about
the
amount
of
time
they
spend
doing
paperwork
others
lament
how
hard
it
is
to
get
accurate
data
from
police
departments
several
firms
fishing
for
business
at
the
conference
in
jacksonville
offered
tools
designed
to
organise
the
huge
amounts
of
information
that
police
take
in
rather
than
gadgets
that
generate
more
of
it
such
tools
are
supposed
to
present
officers
with
as
much
information
as
possible
as
soon
as
they
need
it
and
make
data
taken
from
disparate
sources
easily
accessible
and
searchable
they
are
also
supposed
to
organise
data
in
such
a
way
that
the
cops
can
see
where
they
need
to
improve
chris
fisher
executive
director
of
strategic
initiatives
for
the
seattle
police
department
recently
oversaw
the
building
of
a
data
system
linking
previously
siloed
streams
of
information
such
as
emergency-call
records
stops
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
and
police
use
of
force
this
let
the
department
know
precisely
where
disparities
occur
before
says
mr
fisher
they
often
relied
on
guesswork
and
anecdotal
evidence
to
fill
in
the
blanks
now
we
can
know
in
how
many
of
our
dispatches
did
it
end
up
that
a
person
was
in
crisis
and
in
that
subset
how
often
did
we
use
force

makes
body-worn
cameras
and
tasers
the
police
weapon
that
gave
the
firm

former
name

building
a
system
for
managing
records
jenner
holden
the
firm's
chief
information-security
officer
says
that
what
we
can
do
to
help
officers
improve
most
isn't
the
sexy
stuff
it's
helping
them
be
more
efficient
and
spend
more
time
on
the
