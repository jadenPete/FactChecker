the
mexican-american
population
is
shrinking
a
stand-off
at

southern
border
has
distracted
attention
from
a
much
bigger
change
walk
through
pilsen
a
chicago
neighbourhood
that
is
home
to
successive
waves
of
immigrants
and
two
stories
unfold
in
the
surrounding
streets
the
first
is
seen
in
the
abundance
of
taquer
as
in
bright
murals
of
mexican
cowboys
and
dancing
women
or
in
remittance
and
travel
shops
that
advertise
their
business
ties
to
mexico
the
other
story
is
punctuated
by
vinyl
record
shops
and
vegan
caf
s
on
fashionable
th
street
in
the
district's
population
was
hispanic
and
notably

now
as
it
gets
wealthier
mexicans
are
themselves
being
replaced
sometimes
by
immigrants
notably

often
by

in

head
office
of
the

alliance
an
activist
group
passionately
vows
direct
action
and
to
fight
back
against
rampant
development
but
many
locals
are
phlegmatic
seeing
a
routine
turn
in
the
fortunes
of
the
current
population
from
the
s
onwards
mexican
immigrants
poured
into
pilsen
they
replaced
poles
czechs
and
italians
filling
pews
in
their
brick
churches
and
acquiring
their
businesses
now
they
too
are
moving
up
and
on
each
ethnic
group
and
city
has
its
own
renovation
time
says
julio
vlazquez
a
resident
for
years
we're
relocating
nobody
is
being
pushed
out
mr
vlazquez
is
lucky
brought
to
america
as
a
child
he
prospered
and
bought
his
shop
from
a
departing
pole
a
few
doors
on
sonia
sauceda
tells
of
similar
success
she
arrived
in
and
recalls
meeting
a
pair
of
towering
ancient
polish
women
kittie
and
rosie
who
ran
a
bar
they
disliked
mexicans
like
her
she
became
a
university
graduate
and
accountant
and
invested
her
savings
to
run
a
creper
a
from
their
former
bar
her
year-old
father
owns
and
runs
a
bakery
next
door
business
is
fine
she
says
but
rising
costs
may
prompt
both
to
sell
and
go
now
we
see
the
same
changes
as
poles
did
before
she
says
such
stories
reflect
broader
changes
for
many
mexican-americans
especially
in
bigger
cities
like
chicago
for
one
thing
their
overall
numbers
are
falling
after
four
decades
of
growth
andrew
selee
of
the
migration
policy
institute
mpi
in
washington
points
out
that
since
a
tidal
wave
of
mexicans
going
to
america
has
slowed
to
a
dribble
as
unauthorised
migrants
have
been
replaced
by
legal
ones
data
from
the
pew
research
centre
show
that
patrolmen
on
the
southern
border
arrested
m
mexicans
in
of
all
those
who
were
detained
since
then
mexicans
have
mostly
given
up
frontier-hopping
last
year
the
border
patrol
seized
only
mexicans
just
of
a
much
smaller
total
it
is
a
different
story
for
guatemalans
hondurans
and
other
central
americans
who
do
still
come
illegally
or
claiming
asylum
in
large
numbers
in
fact
the
total
number
of
mexican-born
immigrants
in
america
has
stopped
climbing
and
started
to
fall
notes
randy
capps
also
from
mpi
in
alone
the
number
fell
from
m
to
m
a
sharp
dip
that
is
probably
continuing
that
is
despite
the
lowest
unemployment
in
america
in
half
a
century
previous
spells
of
strong
growth
always
drew
in
mexican
labour
no
longer
higher
incomes
more
jobs
and
an
ageing
population
in
mexico
have
all
shrunk
its
pool
of
potential
migrants
fewer
mexican
migrants
in
all
and
more
who
come
with
papers
america
probably
now
has
more
legal
than
illegal
mexican
migrants
a
notable
tipping
point
have
other
effects
one
is
that
new
arrivals
are
better
educated
than
the
people
who
crossed
earlier
who
were
generally
low-skilled
a
report
published
on
may
th
by
mpi
points
out
that
whereas
only
of
recent
mexican
arrivals
had
a
college
degree
in
some
had
one
by
see
chart
the
institute
estimates
that
there
are
mexican
graduates
in
america
one
of
the
biggest
stocks
of
skilled
immigrants
and
perhaps
most
important
for
successful
integration
such
newcomers
are
also
the
most
likely
to
have
good
english
skills
whereas
mexicans
historically
were
slow
to
acquire
the
language
what
does
this
mean
for
america
mr
selee
is
hopeful
he
sees
mexicans
following
the
path
set
by
southern
and
eastern
europeans
predicting
a
huge
change
in
the
next
years
as
far
fewer
spanish-speaking
migrants
come
in
that
could
be
a
boon
to
those
already
there
one
lesson
after
previous
decades
of
high
migration
ended
as
when
a
law
abruptly
choked
inflows
of
asians
and
some
europeans
is
that
it
can
herald
a
period
when
existing
migrants
and
importantly
their
american-born
children
integrate
successfully
mr
capps
also
sees
mexicans
in
a
situation
analogous
to
european
countries
before
there
was
plenty
of
discrimination
against
italians
and
poles
a
century
ago
for
being
catholic
jewish
or
insufficiently
white
in
the
eyes
of
protestant
americans
but
when
a
slowdown
in
arrivals
is
followed
by
social
mixing
intermarrying
better
education
and
rising
incomes
among
migrants
discrimination
begins
to
disappear
he
says
in
effect
the
designation
of
a
group
as
white
depends
less
on
their
skin
colour
than
their
fortunes
that
is
relevant
for
a
debate
that
periodically
grips
america
in
which
demographers
white
nationalists
and
others
speculate
about
when
the
country's
non-white
population
will
become
the
majority
a
census
estimate
suggests
that
might
happen
as
early
as
the
s
perhaps
but
any
calculation
depends
on
who
is
defining
a
given
group
as
white
or
not
by
then
instead
that
category
may
include
the
biggest
single
group
of
migrants
mexican-americans
just
as
it
now
includes
descendants
of
poles
and
italians
for
all
its
upheaval
pilsen
may
show
a
path
ahead

pharmaceuticals
industry
is

up
europe's

slowdown

sign
