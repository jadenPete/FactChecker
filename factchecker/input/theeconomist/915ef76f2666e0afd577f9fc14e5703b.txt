republican
state
legislatures
are
overturning
ballot
initiatives
the
conservative
suspicion
of
the
demos
is
alive
and
well
in
his
autobiography
memoirs
of
a
superfluous
man
albert
jay
nock
had
this
to
say
about
america's
system
of
self-government
i
could
see
how
democracy
might
do
very
well
in
a
society
of
saints
and
sages
led
by
an
alfred
or
an
antoninus
pius
short
of
that
i
was
unable
to
see
how
it
could
come
to
anything
but
an
ochlocracy
of
mass-men
led
by
a
sagacious
knave
nock
was
among
the
first
writers
to
call
himself
a
libertarian
and
via
william
f.
buckley
and
the
national
review
exercised
significant
influence
on
american
conservatism
given
that
the
republican
party
the
closest
thing
to
a
vehicle
for
the
promotion
of
conservative
ideas
is
in
the
business
of
gathering
votes
the
equivocal
feelings
of
some
conservatives
about
the
demos
are
usually
kept
quiet
occasionally
though
they
break
cover
this
is
what
seems
to
be
happening
around
the
country
in
state
legislatures
with
republican
majorities
last
november
voters
in
several
states
approved
an
array
of
policies
in
ballot
initiatives
these
policies
included
establishing
voting
rights
for
ex-prisoners
the
expansion
of
medicaid
health
insurance
for
the
poor
and
legalising
medical
marijuana
state
governments
were
supposed
to
enact
those
reforms
but
instead
the
republican-controlled
ones
are
seeking
to
roll
them
back
in
utah
voted
in
november
in
favour
of
proposition
a
ballot
initiative
to
expand
medicaid
eligibility
to
everyone
earning
up
to
of
the
federal
poverty
level
which
is
about
a
year
for
a
family
of
four
some
families
who
would
have
received
coverage
under
this
proposal
have
since
had
to
go
without
that
is
because
propositions
passed
via
ballot
initiative
in
utah
are
the
same
as
any
other
laws
passed
by
the
legislature
they
can
be
modified
replaced
or
just
good
old-fashioned
repealed
by
lawmakers
in
this
case
the
utah
state
government
replaced
the
proposal
passed
by
ballot
initiative
with
a
new
one
that
expands
coverage
for
a
smaller
group
those
earning
up
to
of
the
federal
poverty
level
according
to
researchers
at
the
university
of
utah's
kem
c.
gardner
policy
institute
the
revised
bill
therefore
extends
medicaid
to
fewer
residents
than
the
ballot
initiative
that
was
passed
by
the
voters
would
have
done
republican-controlled
state
legislatures
are
also
restricting
medicaid
expansion
in
other
states
where
voters
gave
it
the
go-ahead
in
november
a
widespread
method
for
doing
so
is
to
require
recipients
to
work
to
receive
their
coverage
in
idaho
state
legislators
of
whom
are
republican
passed
a
law
that
removes
a
recipient's
coverage
for
two
months
if
they
do
not
work
volunteer
or
study
for
at
least
hours
per
week
in
nebraska
which
is
moderately
left-leaning
compared
with
the
others
in
the
bunch
republican
governor
pete
ricketts
plans
to
do
the
same
a
similar
rule
enacted
in
arkansas
caused
thousands
of
poor
arkansans
to
lose
their
care
the
most
controversial
case
though
is
in
florida
where
of
voters
passed
constitutional
amendment
in
november
this
amendment
allows
felons
who
had
been
banned
from
voting
in
florida
to
register
to
vote
so
long
as
they
had
completed
all
terms
of
their
sentence
including
parole
or
probation
republican
state
legislators
in
florida's
statehouse
have
since
introduced
a
bill
that
would
add
an
additional
requirement
for
so-called
returning
citizens
to
pay
all
their
fines
and
legal
fees
before
being
allowed
to
register
supporters
of
the
bill
in
the
state
legislature
point
to
the
fact
that
the
measure
is
in
line
with
the
language
lawyers
used
when
explaining
the
amendment
to
florida's
supreme
court
but
the
measure
is
not
what
voters
voted
for
the
florida
rights
restoration
coalition
which
led
the
fight
for
the
amendment
argues
that
legislation
proposed
should
neither
limit
the
rights
created
by
amendment
nor
infringe
upon
the
will
of
florida
voters
the
additional
prerequisite
has
been
likened
by
some
to
a
st-century
poll
tax
a
reference
to
a
scheme
used
to
deny
african
americans
the
right
to
vote
in
the
early
th
century
one
estimate
suggests
it
could
disenfranchise
as
many
as
floridians
a
significant
total
given
that
last
year's
gubernatorial
election
came
down
to
a
margin
of
just
over
votes
somewhere
along
the
road
toward
representative
government
republican
lawmakers
have
decided
to
nock
popular
sovereignty
they
may
well
have
a
point
but
when
a
majority
has
already
decided
in
favour
of
something
it
is
odd
for
a
party
that
is
in
the
election-winning
business
to
fight
so
hard
against
it
