the
democratic
coalition
is
split
over
housing
costs
in
cities
long
ignored
the
yimbys
are
gaining
ground
san
francisco
liberals
are
the
kind
of
people
who
abhor
nativism
in
all
its
forms
and
recoil
at
statements
like
those
recently
made
by
president
donald
trump
that
america
is
full
yet
in
their
own
neighbourhoods
they
often
act
as
if
the
country
were
packed
to
the
brim
the
city
council
acting
unanimously
recently
rejected
a
unit
housing
complex
because
it
would
cast
a
shadow
on
an
adjacent
park
in

berkeley
zoning
officers
can
deny

that
would
unreasonably
obstruct

or

local
residents
in
a
posh
part
of
the
city
have
raised
over
to
contest
plans
for
a
new
homeless
shelter
claiming
that
the
new
megashelter
will
breed
crime
and
violence
drug
users
and
pets
including
those
designated
as
vicious
will
be
allowed
they
warn
these
tactics
along
with
excessive
environmental
reviews
have
hampered
new
development
in
the
city
since
the
city
has
averaged
a
mere
new
housing
units
each
year

where

a

only
the
most
pathological
example
west

cities
which
are
under
near-total
control
of
the
leftiest
democrats
around
rank
among
the
least
affordable
for
middle-class
americans
and
most
inhospitable
to
the
poor
every
morning
traffic
in
the
bay
area
is
clogged
by
service-sector
commuters
some
of
whom
live
far
off
in
the
state's
central
valley
and
must
make
three-hour
long
treks
in
each
direction
the
smog
from
the
cars
settles
in
the
valley
resulting
in
some
of
the
worst
air
quality
in
the
country
fixing
this
is
proving
fractious
democrats
are
increasingly
unified
on
issues
of
national
ideology
surveys
show
that
a
majority
now
self-identify
as
liberals
but
the
politics
of
land
use
in
thriving
cities
scrambles
this
harmony
three
jockeying
coalitions
each
cling
to
the
label
of
liberal
first
there
is
the
landed
gentry
older
residents
who
bought
at
the
right
time
and
are
precious
about
maintaining
their
housing
value
then
come
the
leftist
activists
who
favour
rent
control
massive
public-housing
spending
and
who
think
gentrification
is
terrible
last
are
the
market-oriented
urbanists
who
want
cities
to
fix
their
housing-supply
shortages
by
building
more
the
rent-control
faction
appears
newly
emboldened
in
february
oregon
passed
the
first-ever
statewide
rent-control
law
the
new
legislation
will
limit
rent
increases
to
plus
inflation
meaning
that
it
will
be
largely
irrelevant
except
in
cities
like
portland
kate
brown
the
governor
said
that
it
would
provide
immediate
relief
to
oregonians
struggling
to
keep
up
with
rising
rents
and
a
tight
rental
market
that
might
be
true
of
current
renters
lucky
enough
to
qualify
but
rent
controls
also
work
to
constrain
housing
supply
hurting
future
renters
a
study
by
three
stanford
economists
of
a
rent-control
law
change
in
in
san
francisco
found
that
affected
landlords
decreased
supply
by
increasing
rents
citywide
nearly
m
flats
in
new
york
city
roughly
of
the
housing
stock
are
either
rent-stabilised
or
rent-controlled
yet
it
is
hardly
cheap
in
california
the
degree
of
rent
control
that
cities
can
impose
is
limited
by
a
state
law
known
as
costa-hawkins
in
activists
launched
an
effort
to
repeal
the
rule
by
referendum
they
were
defeated
the
proposition
attracted
its
highest
level
of
support
in
san
francisco
county
unbowed
state
legislators
have
proposed
a
suite
of
bills
that
would
increase
local
rent-control
capacities
in
seattle
also
thriving
due
to
a
tech
boom
kshama
sawant
a
socialist
city
councillor
is
pushing
an
ordinance
that
would
limit
rent
increases
to
move
in
step
with
inflation
housing
prices
are
high
because
demand
has
grown
more
quickly
than
supply
supporters
of
rent
control
pay
no
heed
to
the
opportunities
they
deny
to
poor
and
middle-class
people
to
move
to
thriving
cities
and
yet
the
market-urbanist
coalition
which
pushes
for
relaxed
zoning
rules
and
more
building
had
little
sway
over
local
politics
their
plans
smelled
suspiciously
neoliberal
ideas
that
economists
are
fond
of
seldom
inspire
popular
movements
but
that
has
changed
with
the
emergence
of
the
yimby
movement
a
loosely
organised
bloc
of
those
who
say
yes
in
my
backyard
to
new
development
the
most
ambitious
yimby
proposal
comes
from
scott
wiener
a
former
san
francisco
city
councillor
who
is
now
in
the
state
senate
he
has
written
a
bill
known
as
sb
that
would
pre-empt
local
zoning
rules
and
allow
high-density
building
near
transit
stations
and
centres
of
job
growth
or
high-quality
schooling
for
many
cities
in
the
bay
area
this
would
essentially
legalise
high-density
building
citywide
among
top
local
democrats
the
reaction
has
been
polarised
the
mayors
of
san
francisco
oakland
and
sacramento
are
all
in
favour
the
san
francisco
city
council
is
overwhelmingly
opposed
purportedly
to
slow
gentrification
have
they
looked
around
as
is
the
mayor
of
palo
alto
a
neighbouring
low-slung
town
where
the
median
home
value
is
m
sb
is
a
modified
version
of
legislation
mr
wiener
submitted
last
year
only
to
have
it
die
in
committee
the
new
version
contains
concessions
to
activist
concerns
like
delaying
implementation
in
poor
neighbourhoods
and
adding
tenant
protections
and
looks
politically
hardier
as
a
result
rather
than
having
these
two
camps
or
sub-camps
divided
and
fighting
with
each
other
they
should
be
unified
says
mr
wiener
in
the
end
the
common
opponent
is
the
no-growth
people
who
do
not
want
any
development
in
our
community
they
want
to
freeze
their
communities
in
amber
even
though
their
children
won't
be
able
to
live
where
they
grew
up
in
california
the
success
of
sb
will
depend
on
gavin
newsom
the
new
governor
who
has
shown
a
desire
to
fix
the
state's
deep
housing
problems
during
his
campaign
mr
newsom
pledged
to
build
m
new
housing
units
by
he
has
also
ordered
his
administration
to
sue
huntington
beach
an
attractive
small
town
near
los
angeles
for
failing
to
build
sufficient
affordable
housing
a
requirement
of
a
largely
unenforced
state
law
the
intra-party
politics
of
housing
reform
remain
difficult
sb
has
cleared
one
committee
hurdle
but
has
yet
to
emerge
from
the
state
legislature
and
for
all
his
efforts
elsewhere
mr
newsom
has
yet
to
weigh
in
on
whether
he
would
actually
sign
it
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a

hike
