america's
porous
wall
between
church
and
state
a
supreme
court
case
could
make
the
holes
bigger
in
when
the
supreme
court
first
interpreted
the
constitution's
bar
on
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
the
justices
consulted
thomas
jefferson
the
first
amendment
erects
a
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state
the
third
president
had
written
in
this
means
the
court
said
a
century
and
a
half
later
that
the
government
may
neither
prefer
one
religion
over
another
take
part
in
the
affairs
of
any
religious
organisations
nor
impose
taxes
to
support
religious
activities
or
institutions
justice
hugo
black
explained
in
a
decision
why
this
wall
did
not
stand
in
the
way
of
a
new
jersey
law
covering
the
bus
fares
of
catholic-school
students
in
dissent
justice
robert
jackson
called
the
majority
opinion
utterly
discordant
the
ruling
for
him
brought
to
mind
julia
who
according
to
byron's
reports
whispering
i
will
ne'er
consent
consented
the
battle
over
the
church-state
line
is
no
less
divisive
and
even
more
muddled
years
on
prayer
in
school
was
tossed
out
in
the
s
stand-alone
nativity
scenes
inside
government
buildings
were
struck
down
in
the
s
but
other
biblical
verses
crosses
and
menorahs
in
the
public
square
have
won
the
court's
blessing
on
one
day
in
the
supreme
court
upheld
a
ten
commandments
monument
near
a
capitol
building
while
rejecting
another
outside
a
courthouse
when
the
justices
last
ruled
on
the
matter
in
they
found
no
trouble
with
a
town
board
launching
its
meetings
with
christian
prayers
as
long
as
the
government
does
not
relentlessly
denigrate
or
proselytise
dissenters
justice
anthony
kennedy
wrote
again
for
a
majority
it
respects
america's
church-state
balance
on
february
th
a
new
flashpoint
came
before
the
court
in
the
guise
of
an
old
memorial
to
first-world-war
soldiers
since
bladensburg
in
maryland
has
been
home
to
a
foot
latin
cross
honouring
men
from
prince
george's
county
who
died
in
the
fighting
upon
its
rededication
in
the
peace
cross's
reach
was
extended
to
veterans
of
all
wars
for
rachel
laser
president
of
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state
it
is
remarkable
that
the
cross
which
stands
at
the
intersection
of
two
big
motorways
on
public
ground
is
thought
to
be
anything
but
a
clear
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
the
memorial
is
a
sectarian
symbol
she
says
and
denies
equal
dignity
to
non-christian
soldiers
who
died
when
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
the
cross
in
it
invoked
a
precedent
set
in
lemon
v
kurtzman
a
ruling
that
states
could
not
pay
the
salaries
of
teachers
at
private
catholic
schools
in
pennsylvania
justice
antonin
scalia
once
likened
lemon
to
a
ghoul
in
a
late
night
horror
movie
that
just
won't
die
at
the
supreme
court
hearing
justices
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh
both
professed
a
desire
to
drive
a
stake
through
its
heart
whether
or
not
lemon
gets
the
squeeze
the
oral
arguments
added
credence
to
the
widespread
hunch
that
the
supreme
court
will
save
the
peace
cross
the
question
is
how
bold
the
justices
will
be
late
in
the
hearing
inklings
of
possible
compromise
came
from
justices
elena
kagan
and
stephen
breyer
in
justice
breyer
had
found
it
determinative
that
years
passed
before
anyone
raised
an
objection
to
a
ten
commandments
display
in
texas
his
vote
saved
that
monument
likewise
the
historical
context
of
the
peace
cross
counts
he
said
what
message
would
it
send
he
asked
if
people
see
crosses
all
over
the
country
being
knocked
down
justice
kagan
said
she
too
finds
something
quite
different
about
the
historic
moment
in
time
when
the
cross
was
built
perhaps
the
justices
could
let
the
maryland
memorial
stand
while
saying
no
more
to
future
crosses
on
public
land
a
third
way
could
avoid
bulldozed
crosses
while
respecting
america's
religious
diversity
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
of
the
country
now
identifies
as
something
other
than
christian
gregory
lipper
author
of
a
brief
criticising
the
cross
thinks
justice
breyer's
proposal
could
form
the
basis
of
a
deal
between
the
liberal
justices
and
chief
justice
roberts
it
may
he
says
ward
off
more
grievous
harm
but
with
the
court's
new
conservative
majority
the
chief
may
be
tempted
to
make
a
more
dramatic
statement
when
the
decision
comes
this
spring
thomas
jefferson's
wall
could
be
up
for
a
redo
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
