impeachment
looks
even
less
likely
now
than
before
robert
mueller's
testimony
six
hours
of
i
refer
you
to
what
is
written
in
the
report
will
not
change
the
politics
of
firing
donald
trump
for
two
years
robert
mueller
has
loomed
over
american
politics
nearly
unseen
and
largely
silent
mr
mueller
who
was
appointed
to
investigate
russian
interference
in
the
presidential
election
after
president
donald
trump
sacked
james
comey
the
then-fbi
director
stayed
silent
throughout
the
month
inquiry
in
march
after
indicting
people
executing
searches
and
issuing
subpoenas
his
office
submitted
a
page
report
summarising
its
findings
and
then
closed
mr
mueller
gave
brief
public
remarks
after
the
report's
release
stating
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
him
to
testify
before
congress
because
the
report
is
my
testimony
despite
that
admonishment
on
july
th
mr
mueller
was
hauled
before
two
committees
of
the
house
of
representatives
which
is
controlled
by
the
democrats
and
made
to
testify
for
six
hours
he
did
not
deviate
much
from
his
pledge
democrats
were
hoping
mr
mueller
would
recount
the
president's
misdeeds
in
clear
shareable
sound
bites
that
would
interest
the
voting
public
again
after
the
muted
reception
of
the
report
although
close
associates
of
the
president
were
charged
with
crimes
over
the
course
of
the
investigation
the
report
did
not
turn
up
proof
of
a
conspiracy
with
russia
the
second
half
of
the
report
detailed
repeated
efforts
by
the
president
to
derail
the
investigation
including
by
trying
to
sack
jeff
sessions
the
attorney-general
at
the
time
so
that
mr
mueller
could
be
reined
in
because
of
an
existing
legal
opinion
stating
that
a
sitting
president
cannot
be
indicted
the
report
did
not
reach
a
judgment
on
whether
mr
trump
should
be
prosecuted
for
obstruction
of
justice
the
final
sentence
of
the
report
notes
that
while
this
report
does
not
conclude
that
the
president
committed
a
crime
it
also
does
not
exonerate
him
a
hefty
minority
of
the
party
hankering
after
impeachment
against
the
wishes
of
the
democratic
leadership
had
hoped
to
bolster
their
stalled
case
they
repeated
the
most
damning
excerpts
of
the
report
especially
one
in
which
the
president
slumped
in
chair
and
said
oh
my
god
this
is
terrible
this
is
the
end
of
my
presidency
hoping
that
the
former
special
counsel
would
chime
in
and
help
them
along
but
mr
mueller
who
stammered
asked
for
questions
to
be
repeated
and
answered
questions
with
either
clipped
one-word
replies
or
legalistic
language
did
not
help
their
case
he
refused
to
read
portions
of
the
report
aloud
for
fear
of
becoming
a
political
prop
in
their
campaign
adverts
some
of
which
were
uploaded
online
before
he
had
left
his
chair
leaving
the
various
questioning
congressmen
to
stage
their
own
dramatic
readings
throughout
much
of
the
day
it
appeared
that
the
congressmen
were
testifying
to
mr
mueller
rather
than
the
other
way
around
for
house
democrats
this
was
deflating
an
impeachment
effort
last
week
called
by
representative
al
green
over
the
president's
racist
remarks
died
after
being
turned
back
by
a
majority
of
democrats
it
also
comes
after
months
of
oversight
authority
and
the
subpoena
authority
that
comes
with
leadership
of
the
house
have
failed
to
turn
up
as
much
scandal
as
was
expected
at
the
start
of
the
year
jerrold
nadler
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
committees
already
has
a
primary
challenger
who
charges
that
he
has
been
too
tame
in
his
oversight
of
the
administration
the
republicans
were
almost
uniformly
in
trump-defence
mode
though
they
took
nearly
every
speaking
opportunity
to
assail
mr
mueller's
credibility
and
impartiality
they
did
gleefully
accept
the
conclusion
that
the
investigation
did
not
establish
that
members
of
the
trump
campaign
conspired
or
coordinated
with
the
russian
government
in
its
election
interference
activities
without
question
several
including
devin
nunes
the
senior
republican
on
the
intelligence
committee
advanced
the
conspiracy
theory
that
the
entire
affair
had
been
a
hoax
concocted
by
democrats
and
russia
if
an
aim
of
congressional
democrats
had
been
to
present
the
public
with
a
clear
and
convincing
view
of
presidential
misconduct
this
seesawing
from
one
sympathetic
democrat
to
the
next
republican
inquisitor
will
not
have
helped
stuck
at
the
epicentre
of
a
political
storm
mr
mueller
sought
to
extricate
himself
as
painlessly
as
possible
it
was
an
understandable
strategy
political
showmanship
reigned
in
this
congressional
hearing
as
it
does
in
many
his
few
flashes
of
emotion
came
when
discussing
the
prospect
of
recurring
electoral
interference
over
the
course
of
my
career
i've
seen
a
number
of
challenges
to
our
democracy
the
russian
government's
efforts
to
interfere
in
our
election
is
among
the
most
serious
he
said
in
his
opening
remarks
later
on
he
remarked
that
it
wasn't
a
single
attempt
they're
doing
it
as
we
sit
here
and
they
expect
to
do
it
during
the
next
campaign
nor
did
he
sound
hopeful
that
congress
would
heed
the
warning
asked
whether
the
meddling
of
foreign
governments
in
elections
was
a
permanent
feature
of
american
politics
he
answered
i
hope
this
is
not
the
new
normal
but
i
fear
it
is
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
