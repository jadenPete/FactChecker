new
research

politics
plays
a
big
role
in
choosing
flatmates
for
apartment-hunters

a

an
hour
south

might

the
apartment
which
is
shared
among
four
and
somethings
is
spacious
tidy
and
only
minutes
from

it
comes

of

one
might
assume
that
such
political
preferences
would
be
held
only
among
staunch
partisans
but
a
new
paper
by
richard
shafranek
a
political
science
phd
student
at
northwestern
university
suggests
they
are
relatively
common
in
his
study
published
last
month
in
the
journal
political
behaviour
mr
shafranek
surveyed
a
group
of
students
at
a
large
midwestern
university
he
asked
them
to
answer
a
series
of
demographic
questions
followed
by
questions
about
their
politics
interests
and
personal
habits
subjects
in
the
study
were
then
presented
with
two
fictitious
flatmates
and
asked
to
rate
each
on
a
scale
of
one
to
seven
based
on
the
same
set
of
demographic
and
personal
characteristics
this
was
repeated
for
ten
hypothetical
housemate
pairs
the
results
were
striking
among
the
odd
attributes
included
in
mr
shafranek's
survey
partisan
affiliation
specifically
whether
a
potential
roommate
was
a
member
of
another
party
had
the
biggest
effect
reducing
ratings
by
points
see
chart
this
was
true
even
after
controlling
for
traits
normally
associated
with
support
for
the
two
political
parties
other
undesirable
characteristics
proved
less
influential
subjects
who
described
themselves
as
not
at
all
clean
and
tidy
for
example
were
rated
points
lower
those
who
said
they
preferred
going
to
bed
early
were
downgraded
points
to
ensure
his
results
were
robust
mr
shafranek
estimated
how
a
match
with
a
potential
roommate
on
a
given
characteristic
affected
their
rating
using
this
approach
party
political
affiliation
once
again
came
out
on
top
a
match
on
cleanliness
boosted
scores
by
only
half
as
much
jewish
sports
fans
who
listen
to
hip-hop
are
the
platonic
ideal
of
a
flatmate
does
this
study
say
anything
broader
about
american
politics
the
temptation
is
to
conclude
that
americans
like
living
with
those
who
are
politically
like-minded
in
fact
it
is
more
that
they
dislike
living
with
those
who
think
about
politics
differently
in
an
illustration
of
a
phenomenon
political
scientists
call
negative
partisanship
the
tendency
for
voters
to
be
defined
more
by
their
hatred
of
the
other
side
than
love
for
their
own
the
desire
not
to
live
with
someone
who
votes
for
the
other
party
is
much
greater
than
the
desire
to
live
with
a
fellow
democrat
or
republican
indeed
according
to
mr
shafranek's
estimates
it
is
about
seven
times
as
large
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
