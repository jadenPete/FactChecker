the
stratolaunch
look
burt
rutan
up
on
wikipedia
and
it
will
claim
he
has
retired
this
aeroplane
casts
doubt
on
that
statement
mr
rutan
is
probably
the
most
original
aircraft
designer
in
the
world
and
stratolaunch
as
the
craft
is
known
is
perhaps
his
pi
ce
de
r
sistance
it
made
its
maiden
flight
on
april
th
from
the
mojave
air
and
space
port
in
california
by
wingspan
metres
it
is
the
largest
plane
ever
to
have
flown
it
was
built
by
mr
rutan's
company
for
stratolaunch
systems
a
firm
he
founded
jointly
with
the
late
paul
allen
who
in
turn
had
co-founded
microsoft
its
purpose
is
to
carry
rockets
which
will
fit
between
the
two
fuselages
as
close
to
space
as
possible
before
they
are
launched
into
orbit
thus
saving
fuel
when
commercial
operations
will
start
is
not
yet
clear
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
