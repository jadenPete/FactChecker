democratic
mayors
and
governors
pitch
reforms
to
health
care
their
ideas
range
from
sensible
to
pie-in-the-sky
no
wonk
asked
to
describe
their
ideal
health
system
would
reach
for
the
adjective
american
those
who
can
afford
it
have
access
to
the
best
care
in
the
world
but
costs
are
high
and
the
country's
rate
of
health-insurance
coverage
is
second
to
last
among
the
oecd
club
of
mostly
rich
countries
only
greece
does
a
poorer
job
things
would
look
worse
had
the
affordable
care
act
aca
better
known
as
obamacare
not
become
law
in
of
americans
lacked
health
insurance
compared
with
in
reducing
that
to
zero
would
require
the
kind
of
universal
scheme
democrats
crave
but
that
will
not
come
soon
meanwhile
democrats
in
charge
of
big
states
and
cities
are
taking
it
upon
themselves
to
reduce
their
uninsured
rates
even
further
their
ideas
range
from
sensible
to
pie-in-the-sky
the
share
of
people
lacking
health
insurance
varies
enormously
from
state
to
state
those
that
chose
not
to
expand
medicaid
government
health
insurance
for
the
very
poor
out
of
their
disdain
for
obamacare
have
a
higher
proportion
of
uninsured
people
more
than
twice
as
high
as
those
that
did
expand
having
large
numbers
of
illegal
immigrants
who
are
four
times
likelier
to
be
uninsured
than
citizens
also
affects
the
number
texas
a
state
with
a
large
undocumented
population
and
tight
eligibility
criteria
for
medicaid
has
the
nation's
highest
uninsured
rate
at
in
massachusetts
by
contrast
it
is
most
democrat-led
states
have
already
expanded
their
medicaid
programmes
though
they
must
still
contend
with
high
health-care
costs
and
the
problem
of
uninsured
undocumented
people
gavin
newsom
the
new
governor
of
california
issued
a
plan
on
day
one
of
the
job
mr
newsom
would
like
to
reinstate
the
requirement
that
everyone
must
have
health
insurance
or
else
pay
a
penalty
republicans
killed
that
in
the
tax
legislation
of
with
those
funds
he
would
increase
subsidies
for
people
purchasing
insurance
on
the
exchanges
set
up
under
the
aca
he
would
use
state
funds
to
expand
medicaid
coverage
for
young
undocumented
people
up
to
the
age
of
the
current
cut-off
is
mr
newsom
also
suggested
that
california
should
negotiate
directly
with
pharmaceutical
firms
over
drug
prices
a
common
tactic
in
other
developed
countries
bill
de
blasio
the
mayor
of
new
york
turned
heads
when
he
announced
a
seemingly
groundbreaking
proposal
to
guarantee
health
care
for
the
city's
uninsured
people
mr
de
blasio
who
appears
to
be
flirting
with
a
presidential
run
chose
morning
joe
a
television
talk
show
to
unveil
his
most
comprehensive
plan
in
the
nation
perhaps
the
kind
of
announcement
aimed
at
democratic
primary
voters
who
swoon
at
those
three
magic
words
medicare
for
all
it
certainly
seemed
welcome
to
people
like
michelle
fraser
a
home-health
aide
in
the
city
who
looks
after
people
for
a
living
but
cannot
afford
her
own
insurance
yet
on
inspection
the
plan
is
less
grand
it
is
a
moderate
expansion
of
existing
programmes
providing
access
to
city
hospitals
pharmacies
primary
care
and
addiction-treatment
services
for
the
undocumented
and
uninsured
the
estimated
cost
of
the
proposal
about
m
a
year
also
hints
at
its
modesty
that
works
out
at
an
expenditure
of
per
uninsured
person
the
average
new
yorker
spent
on
health
care
in
according
to
the
health
care
cost
institute
which
collects
data
from
large
insurers
other
democratic
states
are
not
sitting
out
jay
inslee
the
governor
of
washington
has
proposed
a
public
option
on
the
state's
health-insurance
exchanges
to
provide
choice
in
rural
areas
and
control
costs
from
new
mexico
to
minnesota
democratic
governors
may
allow
residents
to
buy
medicaid
each
of
these
approaches
could
move
america
closer
towards
universal
coverage
while
avoiding
the
trap
of
trying
to
remake
its
health-care
system
overnight
those
democrats
vying
for
the
presidential
nomination
are
sure
to
run
on
a
message
of
radical
upheaval
their
lesser-known
comrades
might
actually
get
something
done
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
