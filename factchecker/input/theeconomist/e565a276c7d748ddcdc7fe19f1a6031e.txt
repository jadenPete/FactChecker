the
democratic
primary
is
already
the
most
left-wing
in
decades
this
looks
like
a
bad
strategy
for
beating
donald
trump
moderate
democrats
have
had
a
good
few
months
they
dominated
the
democratic
primaries
ahead
of
the
mid-term
elections
duly
delivered
a
democratic
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
have
been
quietly
getting
their
way
there
too
for
all
the
hoopla
over
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
the
house
agenda
looks
pragmatic
with
a
focus
on
fiscal
prudence
infrastructure
development
and
not
impeaching
president
donald
trump
house
democrats
think
this
approach
will
keep
on
board
the
centrist
voters
they
won
last
year
that
looks
like
a
more
promising
way
to
get
rid
of
mr
trump
so
why
are
the
early
democratic
runners
for
next
year's
presidential
election
flocking
to
the
left
in
hillary
clinton
said
senator
bernie
sanders's
promise
of
universal
state-provided
health
care
could
never
ever
come
to
pass
most
democratic
candidates
in
competitive
mid-terms
races
also
rejected
it
yet
all
three
heavyweights
who
have
so
far
declared
for
the
senators
kirsten
gillibrand
kamala
harris
and
elizabeth
warren
are
for
it
so
are
several
big
names
expected
to
announce
shortly
including
senator
cory
booker
and
mr
sanders
himself
only
ms
warren
and
mr
sanders
among
them
have
a
record
of
taking
populist
positions
the
rest
have
leapt
to
them
indeed
the
uniformity
of
their
proposals
is
striking
most
offer
some
version
of
mr
sanders's
free
college
pledge
all
are
for
giving
a
federal
job
to
whomever
wants
one
as
first
suggested
by
mr
booker
these
proposals
are
not
necessarily
crazy
the
health-care
system
is
a
mess
but
the
idea
that
they
could
form
a
realistic
agenda
for
a
governing
system
choked
by
partisanship
is
absurd
the
light-headed
fashion
in
which
the
early
runners
are
airing
their
proposals
adds
to
that
impression
slammed
on
social
media
for
having
promised
only
two
years
of
free
college
juli
n
castro
once
barack
obama's
centrist
housing
secretary
shot
back
that
he'd
push
for
four
then
pressed
for
her
view
of
private
medical
insurance
ms
harris
said
she'd
scrap
it
she
later
tried
to
walk
that
back
yet
what
was
she
what
are
they
all
thinking
of
ms
ocasio-cortez
for
one
inspired
by
the
demise
of
the
centralised
party
structure
and
the
rise
of
social
media
the
left-wing
activist
world
she
represents
has
rarely
been
more
vibrant
or
intimidating
to
the
democratic
establishment
some
compare
it
to
the
supercharged
activism
that
pushed
the
democrats
leftward
in
the
s
and
s
the
alacrity
with
which
ms
harris
and
ms
warren
praised
ms
ocasio-cortez's
signature
policy
the
green
new
deal
supports
that
so
does
the
fact
that
a
year-old
freshman
congresswoman
is
considered
to
have
a
signature
policy
that
is
one
of
two
structural
changes
behind
the
new
populism
the
other
is
the
growing
importance
of
online
fundraising
which
most
democratic
consultants
think
requires
bold
left-wing
pledges
especially
in
a
crowded
primary
field
in
which
cash-hungry
populists
will
compete
to
be
the
boldest
that
contest
promises
in
turn
to
make
online
fundraising
even
more
important
to
those
involved
because
it
will
make
wall
street
donors
less
generous
ms
warren's
proposed
wealth
tax
on
households
worth
over
m
has
already
given
them
something
to
hate
still
the
effect
of
these
structural
factors
can
be
overstated
as
the
mid-terms
indicate
the
activists
are
not
in
step
with
most
democratic
voters
who
appear
more
focused
on
opposing
mr
trump
than
on
remaking
the
health-care
system
historical
comparisons
underline
this
the
leftward
lurches
of
the
s
and
s
were
also
spurred
by
events
in
the
form
of
the
great
depression
and
the
civil-rights
struggle
which
convinced
millions
of
the
need
for
radical
change
there
is
little
evidence
that
most
democratic
voters
think
today's
more
complicated
socioeconomic
inequities
warrant
the
big
expansion
of
the
state
that
the
populist
candidates
are
promising
even
in
fairly
liberal
states
such
as
colorado
voters
have
rejected
proposals
for
a
single-payer
health-care
scheme
mr
sanders's
better-than-expected
run
in
said
more
about
dissatisfaction
with
mrs
clinton
than
the
power
of
his
ideas
this
also
suggests
the
consultants
may
be
wrong
to
demand
hard-left
pledges
for
the
purpose
of
fundraising
of
the
three
past
masters
of
online
fundraising
mr
obama
beto
o'rourke
and
mr
sanders
only
the
last
is
an
outright
left-winger
the
disruptive
effect
of
mr
trump
offers
more
fundamental
explanations
for
the
democrats
lurch
to
the
left
activists
think
his
ideological
nonconformity
and
unpopularity
afford
them
an
opportunity
to
shift
the
overton
window
to
the
left
establishment
figures
such
as
mr
booker
and
ms
harris
still
seem
mesmerised
by
his
ability
to
make
headline-grabbing
pronouncements
with
which
mrs
clinton
could
not
compete
for
attention
this
seems
to
underappreciate
his
subsequent
weakness
over
half
of
voters
roughly
the
portion
the
democratic
candidate
would
need
say
they
will
definitely
not
vote
for
him
it
is
not
obvious
why
such
voters
sick
of
mr
trump's
antics
would
warm
to
a
democrat
offering
a
different
set
of
implausible
promises
if
we
try
to
out-crazy
the
policy
announcements
of
a
troubled
president
we
will
do
nothing
to
restore
confidence
warns
senator
chris
coons
of
delaware
trying
to
improve
on
mrs
clinton
may
be
a
better
strategy
and
her
proposals
were
the
least
of
her
problems
voters
rejected
her
because
they
didn't
like
or
identify
with
her
not
because
her
jobs
plan
was
small-bore
the
new
populists
reluctance
to
grapple
with
that
hints
at
a
lack
of
confidence
in
their
own
ability
to
win
voters
trust
it
is
surely
no
coincidence
that
they
represent
the
main
cohort
of
hated
washington
insiders
in
the
contest
more
outsiderish
candidates
perhaps
including
mr
o'rourke
who
like
mr
obama
before
him
is
not
primarily
associated
with
washington
despite
his
time
in
congress
may
be
better
at
talking
to
voters
without
promising
them
the
moon
but
there
is
no
sign
of
them
yet
for
now
the
race
is
dominated
by
senators
offering
the

swiss

other

china's
