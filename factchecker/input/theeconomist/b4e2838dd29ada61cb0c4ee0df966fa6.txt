the
supreme
court
wraps
up
its
term
inching
to
the
right
justice
kavanaugh
was
a
bit
more
moderate
than
court-watchers
expected
the
supreme
court
opened
for
business
in
october
amid
high
drama
over
president
donald
trump's
nominee
to
replace
justice
anthony
kennedy
a
year
veteran
following
testimony
from
a
high-school
classmate
that
he
had
assaulted
her
as
a
teenager
brett
kavanaugh
mr
kennedy's
more
conservative
former
clerk
squeaked
through
the
senate
by
a
vote
in
some
ways
justice
kavanaugh
has
met
expectations
he
voted
to
preserve
a
gigantic
cross
on
public
land
in
maryland
he
rebuffed
several
last-minute
stay
requests
in
death-penalty
cases
the
conservative
justices
took
turns
joining
the
liberal
justices
in
nine
victories
and
they
chalked
up
only
half
as
many
wins
in
closely
divided
cases
as
they
did
a
year
ago
it
seems
the
partisan
confirmation
fight
may
have
tamed
mr
kavanaugh
a
bit
in
his
first
go-round
the
junior
justice
disappointed
abortion
opponents
when
he
joined
the
liberals
and
john
roberts
the
chief
in
refusing
to
hear
two
challenges
to
funding
for
planned
parenthood
he
broke
with
the
conservative
bloc
in
an
antitrust
lawsuit
against
apple
holding
that
consumers
could
sue
the
company
for
gouging
them
on
its
app
store
and
in
flowers
v
mississippi
provoking
an
irate
dissent
from
justices
neil
gorsuch
and
clarence
thomas
he
sided
with
a
black
death-row
inmate
whose
trials
were
infected
by
racial
bias
in
jury
selection
remarkably
justice
kavanaugh
broke
with
his
fellow
trump
appointee
neil
gorsuch
in
nearly
a
third
of
the
term's
rulings
meanwhile
reflecting
a
preference
for
the
centre-right
he
and
chief
justice
roberts
voted
the
same
way
over
of
the
time
among
the
highest
buddy
rates
of
any
pair
of
justices
the
most
indelible
mark
of
justice
kavanaugh's
first
year
was
his
vote
to
abandon
his
predecessor's
ambition
announced
years
ago
to
rein
in
the
business
of
rigging
elections
the
judiciary
should
be
prepared
to
order
relief
justice
kennedy
wrote
in
providing
that
a
workable
standard
for
policing
partisan
gerrymandering
could
be
found
it
now
seems
that
quest
is
dead
despite
voicing
concerns
about
the
dangers
to
democracy
posed
by
gerrymandering
in
two
redistricting
hearings
justice
kavanaugh
anchored
a
majority
in
rucho
v
common
cause
to
preserve
extreme
gerrymandering
from
constitutional
objections
chief
justice
roberts
author
of
the
rucho
opinion
did
not
applaud
skewed
district
lines
they
are
he
acknowledged
pointing
to
the
seat
advantage
for
north
carolina
republicans
in
the
house
of
representatives
despite
the
state's
fairly
even
republican-democratic
split
highly
partisan
but
that
does
not
mean
the
practice
is
unconstitutional
federal
judges
cannot
stop
stunts
like
north
carolina's
even
those
that
may
reasonably
seem
unjust
because
challenges
to
engineered
maps
present
political
questions
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
courts
in
a
thunderous
dissent
justice
elena
kagan
wrote
that
what
the
court
says
can't
be
done
has
been
done
lower-court
judges
from
wisconsin
to
ohio
to
maryland
have
largely
converged
on
a
standard
for
adjudicating
partisan
gerrymandering
claims
and
struck
down
maps
drafted
by
both
parties
that
are
extreme
outliers
rucho
she
wrote
will
embolden
state
legislators
who
have
debased
and
dishonoured
our
democracy
turning
upside-down
the
core
american
idea
that
all
governmental
power
derives
from
the
people
the
conservative
bloc's
decision
she
concluded
with
deep
sadness
risks
irreparably
damag
ing
our
system
of
government
another
challenge
to
the
integrity
of
america's
democracy
was
averted
in
a
row
over
the
trump
administration's
wish
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
after
the
oral
argument
it
seemed
certain
the
five
conservative
justices
would
hand
the
government
a
win
despite
evidence
the
question
would
spur
a
pronounced
undercount
of
people
in
mostly
democratic
states
the
stakes
were
high
population
data
from
the
decennial
census
direct
the
flow
of
billions
of
federal
dollars
and
set
the
number
of
congressional
representatives
allocated
to
each
state
chief
justice
roberts
knocked
down
the
challengers
legal
arguments
one
by
one
but
saved
a
plot-twist
for
the
end
while
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
federal
law
stopping
the
government
from
asking
census-takers
if
they
are
citizens
he
wrote
wilbur
ross
the
commerce
secretary
violated
administrative
law
when
he
gave
a
contrived
reason
for
the
change
enforcing
the
voting
rights
act
of
the
official
justification
was
a
distraction
the
chief
wrote
this
is
as
close
as
a
chief
justice
gets
to
calling
a
cabinet
secretary
a
liar
the
ruling
left
open
a
small
window
for
mr
ross
to
come
up
with
a
genuine
rationale
but
on
july
nd
he
closed
it
saying
the
census
form
was
rolling
off
the
presses
without
the
citizenship
question
pandemonium
ensued
on
july
rd
after
a
defiant
tweet
from
mr
trump
the
government
now
says
it
will
give
the
question
another
go
however
this
circus
ends
melissa
murray
of
new
york
university
cautions
that
the
supreme
court
ruling
does
not
foreclose
such
a
question
being
included
in
a
future
census
and
predicts
that
if
republicans
hold
the
white
house
in
it
will
be
on
there
she
also
notes
that
the
lawsuit
may
depress
response
rates
even
with
no
citizenship
query
china's
