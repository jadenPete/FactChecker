elizabeth
warren's
ideas
get
noticed
michael
bennet's
are
better
the
senator
from
colorado
deserves
more
attention
to
simplify
just
a
bit
the
democratic
presidential
primary
has
two
competing
ideological
factions
the
first
is
the
brand
of
leftism
assertive
and
ascendant
championed
by
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
which
preaches
ideas
like
protectionism
medicare
for
all
a
green
new
deal
and
decriminalising
illegal
border
crossings
arrayed
against
this
is
a
squishy
moderation
exemplified
by
joe
biden
the
former
vice-president
and
current
front-runner
and
kamala
harris
the
senator
from
california
both
of
them
have
attempted
to
please
what
they
assume
is
an
increasingly
left-wing
primary
electorate
while
not
going
so
far
as
to
alienate
moderates
the
results
have
been
mixed
mr
biden
began
his
campaign
with
a
flip-flop
on
whether
the
federal
government
should
pay
for
abortions
no
then
yes
apparently
and
ms
harris
flip-flop-flip-flopped
on
whether
private
health
insurance
should
be
abolished
no
yes
no
yes
apparently
meanwhile
the
candidate
perhaps
most
intellectually
capable
of
challenging
the
party's
leftward
creep
senator
michael
bennet
of
colorado
is
gaining
little
traction
my
worry
is
that
if
we're
going
down
the
road
of
medicare
for
all
and
open
borders
that
could
disqualify
us
with
the
american
people
going
into
the
election
in
he
says
many
in
the
field
are
fixated
on
medicare
for
all
an
idea
for
universal
coverage
pitched
by
mr
sanders
in
which
the
government
programme
for
the
elderly
becomes
a
single-payer
for
everyone's
care
that
is
free
at
the
point
of
use
private
insurance
would
no
longer
exist
i
think
what
we're
creating
here
is
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem
says
mr
bennet
who
notes
that
m
americans
get
health
insurance
through
work
and
that
the
estimated
tax
needed
for
mr
sanders's
idea
trn
over
ten
years
is
of
current
federal
revenues
his
competing
plan
known
as
medicare
x
and
unlike
others
unveiled
years
not
months
before
his
presidential
run
would
try
to
achieve
universal
coverage
by
allowing
people
to
buy
health
insurance
from
the
government
and
by
shoring
up
the
insurance
exchanges
set
up
under
the
affordable
care
act
better
known
as
obamacare
and
if
the
american
people
hate
private
insurance
as
much
as
bernie
thinks
they
do
we
might
end
up
with
medicare
x
displacing
the
private
market
i
suspect
that's
not
where
the
american
people
will
be
mr
bennet
adds
rather
than
being
defined
just
in
relief
mr
bennet
also
differs
in
what
he
would
spend
money
on
he
has
put
two
objectives
at
the
centre
of
his
economic
pitch
investing
in
the
of
american
workers
without
a
college
degree
and
eroding
childhood
poverty
both
are
big
progressive-sounding
ideas
except
that
they
are
not
much
discussed
by
progressives
help
for
non-college-educated
americans
which
he
estimates
would
cost
bn
over
ten
years
would
come
in
the
form
of
wage
subsidies
wage
insurance
and
grants
for
training
by
concentrating
on
work
mr
bennet
takes
note
of
the
perennial
worry
about
welfare
traps
his
other
big
proposal
monthly
cash
transfers
of
for
each
american
child
has
gone
unnoticed
beside
flashier
offers
like
a
universal
basic
income
from
andrew
yang
or
universal
child
care
paid
for
by
a
wealth
tax
from
ms
warren
for
of
the
costs
of
medicare
for
all
you
could
reduce
childhood
poverty
in
america
by
and
end
a-day
childhood
poverty
in
america
says
mr
bennet
because
interventions
to
improve
economic
mobility
are
most
effective
early
in
life
my
starting
point
would
be
free
preschool
not
free
college
ms
warren
has
risen
in
the
polls
by
creating
the
brand
of
a
wonkish
populist
with
a
plan
for
everything
including
one
inquiring
supporter's
love
life
mr
bennet's
ideas
are
a
foil
to
these
they
are
just
as
rigorous
and
technocratic
but
more
rooted
in
pragmatism
unfortunately
few
voters
have
taken
notice
yet
after
attending
the
first
two
debates
mr
bennet
failed
to
qualify
for
the
television
debate
that
will
be
held
on
september
th
because
of
its
more
stringent
polling
and
fundraising
requirements
still
mr
bennet
has
pledged
to
continue
his
campaign
until
the
first
actual
votes
which
are
not
for
five
months
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
