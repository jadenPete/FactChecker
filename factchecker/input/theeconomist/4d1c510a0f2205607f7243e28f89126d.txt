says
saad

in

he
sees
a

of
two
parts
more
numerous
are
the

including
parents
often
mothers

are
insufficiently

anti-vaxxers
views
do
not
come
out
of
the
blue
mr
omer
says
underlying
values
lead
people
in
different
ways
to
scepticism
about
science
some
aspire
to
live
a
more
natural
life
or
may
be
religious
and
fret
over
untrue
rumours
that
tissue
from
aborted
fetuses
goes

doses
some
like
dr

say
they
are
not
anti-science
only
anti-big

cherish
liberty
above

that

no
right

for

robert
krakow
a
lawyer
in
new
york
and
prominent
anti-vaxxer
agrees
that
the
movement
is
diverse
it
cuts
across
all
political
ideologies
all
demographics
you
can't
pin
it
down
but
all
share
a
deep
mistrust
of
public-health
bodies
nor
is
it
associated
with
one
party
although
president
donald
trump
and
some
other
republican
politicians
have
been
sympathetic
others
like
mr
kennedy
lean
left
meghan
moran
at
johns
hopkins
university
says
the
biggest
battle
may
prove
to
be
online
studying
avowedly
anti-vaccine
websites
she
tracked
how
many
made
powerful
use
of
anecdotes
a
tragic
story
to
stir
fear
and
sympathy
in
a
parent
can
be
a
more
effective
spur
to
action
than
any
number
of
statistics
many
sites
strive
to
spread
mistrust
in
government
or
other
authorities
she
says
tracking
who
funds
online
activity
or
promotes
sometimes
shrill
debate
on
social
media
is
harder
a
few
family
foundations
donate
to
anti-vaxxers
under
the
guise
of
promoting
vaccine
choice
non-profit
groups
the
children's
medical
safety
research
institute
has
funded
research
into
vaccines
the
institute
is
backed
by
the
dwoskin
family
foundation
the
charitable
arm
of
a
property
developer
and
a
regular
donor
to
democratic
causes
the
dwoskins
have
paid
for
meetings
and
films
on
vaccines
claire
dwoskin's
personal
stance
is
clear
she
once
called
vaccines
a
holocaust
of
poison
on
our
children's
brains
responding
effectively
to
all
this
requires
the
pro-vaccine
camp
to
learn
to
communicate
with
more
warmth
and
fewer
statistics
peter
hotez
a
renowned
vaccine
expert
in
houston
says
a
feeble
public
response
is
partly
to
blame
for
anti-vaxxers
creeping
from
fringe
to
mainstream
in
recent
years
adopting
the
anecdotal
approach
he
has
published
a
moving
book
telling
of
his
own
daughter's
autism
and
how
vaccines
did
not
cause
it
he
sees
anti-vaxxers
making
a
concerted
effort
to
break
into
party
politics
for
example
in
texas
where
a
newish
vaccine-choice
political
action
committee
backed
candidates
for
state
elections
last
year
similar
pacs
have
been
formed
in
oklahoma
and
michigan
despite
that
it
seems
likelier
that
more
states
will
tighten
requirements
that
schoolchildren
get
their
jabs
mr
omer
says
the
strongest
lesson
to
take
from
anti-vaxxers
is
to
stop
being
passive
most
of
us
are
pro-vaccine
but
we
are
often
silent
bystanders
speaking
up
early
for
vaccines
say
by
offering
emotional
stories
of
lives
saved
to
parents-to-be
might
be
one
way
ahead
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
