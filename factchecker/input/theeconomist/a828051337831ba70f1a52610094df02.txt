the
politicisation
of
white
evangelical
christianity
is
hurting
it
a
group
of
disenchanted
evangelicals
the
exvies
is
among
the
denomination's
biggest
threats
arms
outstretched
the
congregation
at
hyde
park
baptist
church
welcomed
the
holy
spirit
into
their
two-storey
stained-glass
sanctuary
along
with
the
spirit
came
their
pastor
kie
bowman
accompanied
by
a
full
jazz
orchestra
he
summed
up
his
sermon
as
to
impact
culture
love
the
bible
but
interspersed
with
this
joyful
invitation
to
share
the
gospel
were
some
spiky
remarks
such
his
assertion
that
you
have
to
be
convinced
by
the
media
that
god
does
not
exist
such
has
been
the
transformation
of
white
evangelical
christianity
over
the
past
half-century
but
conservative
politics
in
church
have
also
caused
a
backlash
mr
bowman's
statements
reflect
the
battle
that
evangelical
denominations
have
been
fighting
since
the
s
when
evangelical
leaders
began
to
move
past
discussions
about
morality
and
embraced
conservative
rhetoric
about
individual
rights
andrew
lewis
author
of
a
book
about
this
phenomenon
called
the
rights
turn
says
that
republicans
and
conservative
christians
now
have
a
shared
approach
to
the
law
as
examples
he
points
to
the
use
of
free-speech
rights
to
defend
anti-abortion
legislation
and
to
argue
against
regulating
campaign
finance
that
fusion
seemed
complete
in
when
of
white
born-again
christians
voted
for
donald
trump
according
to
data
from
the
democracy
fund
voter
study
group
yet
this
coupling
seems
to
be
hurting
membership
of
evangelical
churches
several
polling
firms
have
detected
a
decline
in
the
share
of
americans
who
describe
themselves
as
white
evangelicals
over
the
past
decade
the
pew
research
centre
found
a
two-percentage-point
drop
from
to
prri
found
a
six-percentage-point
drop
in
the
share
of
the
population
that
identify
as
white
evangelicals
from
in
to
in
abc
and
the
washington
post
found
a
still
larger
decline
of
eight
percentage
points
larger
than
the
drop
among
mainline
white
protestants
the
problem
is
partly
generational
in
the
prri
data
just
of
young
americans
aged
say
they
are
white
evangelicals
while
of
those
aged
or
older
are
white
evangelical
protestants
together
with
the
decline
in
the
share
of
whites
who
identify
as
catholics
this
has
caused
anxiety
among
some
of
the
faithful
that
white
christian
america
is
under
threat
the
argument
about
how
to
restore
lost
greatness
has
been
running
for
years
in
the
late
s
the
southern
baptist
convention
sbc
an
umbrella
organisation
for
evangelical
churches
was
roiled
by
a
confrontation
between
modernisers
who
were
in
charge
of
the
organisation
and
traditionalists
who
blamed
them
for
presiding
over
a
levelling-off
in
church
attendance
the
traditionalists
won
but
on
their
watch
the
malaise
has
worsened
nor
are
falling
numbers
the
only
problem
an
exhaustive
investigation
by
the
houston
chronicle
and
the
san
antonio
express-news
identified
more
than
church
leaders
who
have
been
accused
of
sexually
abusing
people
who
worshipped
at
sbc
churches
many
churches
remain
committed
to
preaching
conservative
politics
from
the
pulpit
on
sundays
the
sbc's
leadership
however
has
been
critical
of
mr
trump
russell
moore
a
theologian
who
heads
its
work
on
public
policy
is
among
the
president's
most
eloquent
critics
this
may
be
too
little
too
late
for
a
group
of
former
evangelicals
who
are
trying
to
organise
ex-vangelicals
or
exvies
into
a
nascent
political
movement
christopher
stroop
a
journalist
has
emerged
as
a
leader
among
the
exvies
mr
stroop
was
raised
in
a
fundamentalist
evangelical
household
where
he
went
to
non-denominational
christian
schools
and
was
surrounded
mostly
by
friends
who
shared
his
beliefs
in
high-school
biology
lessons
about
dna
would
be
interspersed
with
preaching
from
the
teacher
and
sometimes
with
documentaries
on
flood
geology
and
the
search
for
noah's
ark
there
was
strong
pressure
to
be
a
young-earth
creationist
mr
stroop
says
he
also
recalls
a
class
field-trip
during
school
hours
to
a
prototype
tea
party
convention
mr
stroop
says
his
education
was
all
about
isolating
children
in
the
subculture
so
they'll
grow
up
to
be
the
culture
warriors
the
church
wants
them
to
be
he
typifies
a
larger
pattern
in
a
paper
published
in
paul
djupe
jacob
neiheisel
and
anand
sokhey
all
political
scientists
found
that
people
stop
attending
church
when
they
have
intellectual
disagreements
with
their
religion
and
when
they
lose
social
attachments
to
their
congregations
since
americans
have
become
yoked
to
their
political
tribe
with
an
intensity
that
often
rivals
religious
fervour
those
with
moderate
political
disagreements
frequently
find
their
faith
hard
to
reconcile
with
their
politics
and
end
up
leaving
their
churches
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
