the
fund
for
victims
of
the

is
struggling
to
meet
all
claims
on
september
th
john
feal
a
demolition
worker
went
to
the
fiery
pit
that
was
ground
zero
to
help
recover
those
lost
and
to
help
clean
up
the
rubble
of
the
world
trade
centre
five
days
later
an
lb
kg
piece
of
steel
fell
on
his
foot
crushing
it
after
nearly
dying
from
infections
and
losing
part
of
his
foot
mr
feal
found
out
that
he
was
not
eligible
for
financial
help
for
his
medical
care
he
created
the
feal
good
foundation
and
became
an
advocate
for
his
fellow
first
responders
travelling
with
busloads
of
firefighters
and
other
sick
or
injured
survivors
to
washington
to
urge
congress
to
pass
a
bill
paying
for
medical
care
and
monitoring
after
years
of
lobbying
in
congress
passed
the
james
zadroga
september
health
and
compensation
act
to
provide
free
medical
care
and
create
both
a
health
registry
and
a
victim
compensation
fund
vcf
the
need
was
great
thousands
of
first
responders
and
survivors
as
well
as
those
who
worked
and
lived
downtown
were
not
well
when
the
towers
fell
a
cloud
of
dust
made
up
of
glass
fibres
asbestos
lead
pulverised
cement
and
a
host
of
other
carcinogens
was
spewed
into
the
air
some
first
responders
got
sick
right
away
developing

trade
centre
cough
a
persistent
hacking
for
many
illnesses
often
deadly
ones
did
not
reveal
themselves
for
years
some
are
battling
several
ailments
simultaneously
from
gastrointestinal
illness
and
respiratory
disease
to
an
array
of
rare
cancers
james
zadroga
a
police
officer
who
worked
for
more
than
hours
in
the
debris
developed
a
cough
and
later
was
unable
to
breathe
without
an
oxygen
tank
his
death
in
was
the
first
to
be
attributed
to
exposure
to
the
dust
at
ground
zero
it
was
not
the
last
more
than
officers
exposed
to
the
hazardous
materials
have
since
died
more
than
firefighters
and
fbi
agents
have
died
from
illnesses
related
to
the
disaster
according
to
the
vcf's
administrator
the
fund
saw
a
increase
in
death
claims
in
compared
with
claims
from
the
sick
have
soared
too
saw
a
record
number
of
claims
and
the
largest
amount
of
compensation
bn
awarded
in
a
year
claim-filing
has
increased
markedly
in
the
past
four
months
see

on
february
th
rupa
bhattacharyya
the
fund's
special
master
announced
that
there
is
not
sufficient
funding
to
pay
the
pending
claims
and
the
thousands
more
expected
the
bn
fund
is
running
out
of
money
so
far
bn
has
been
distributed
to
eligible
claimants
leaving
just
bn
to
compensate
all
pending
and
anticipated
future
claims
through
to
the
end
of
to
ensure
everyone
gets
some
compensation
ms
bhattacharyya
is
reducing
the
awards
claims
made
before
february
st
will
be
reduced
by
claims
made
after
will
be
reduced
by
michael
barasch
a
lawyer
who
represents
claimants
said
he
has
been
fielding
calls
from
panicked
clients
many
of
them
very
ill
battling
multiple
illnesses
related
to
the
exposure
to
the
toxins
released
that
terrible
day
mr
zadroga
was
one
of
his
clients
ms
bhattacharyya
is
painfully
aware
of
the
inequity
of
the
situation
but
said
that
the
law
really
left
her
no
choice
mr
feal
does
not
blame
her
no
one
envisioned
the
explosion
of
the
number
of
cancers
and
deaths
he
blames
congress
he
will
soon
head
to
washington
to
push
for
more
money
and
a
fund
extension

th
kirsten
gillibrand
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
and
a
new
york
senator
along
with
cory
gardner
a
republican
senator
from
colorado
intend
to
introduce
a
bill
to
ensure
all
first
responders
and
survivors
receive
full
compensation
well
into
the
future

they
become
ill
the

permanent
authorisation
of
the
september
th
victim

act
would
close
the
vcf's
current
funding
gap
despite
some
bipartisan
support
the
bill
will
probably
face
opposition
mitch
mcconnell
the
senate
majority
leader
objected
to
the
fund's
original
cost
and
opposed
extending
the
fund's
deadline
days
after
the
attacks
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency
epa
said
the

in

was

it
was
a
reassuring
announcement
for
the
thousands
of
office
workers
who
returned
to
work
and
for
the
pupils
who
returned
to
school
but
the
air
was
not
safe
a

ruled
that
the
