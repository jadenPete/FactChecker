what
caused
the
shameful
scenes
at
america's
southern
border
circumstances
beyond
the
white
house's
control
deliberate
policy
choices
and
plain
old
incompetence
it
is
always
the
best
of
times
and
the
worst
of
times
in
america
for
president
donald
trump
various
things
have
simultaneously
never
been
worse
owing
to
democratic
meddling
but
also
never
been
better
thanks
to
his
own
intervention
our
country
has
a
hole
nobody
sees
anything
like
it
but
we've
stopped
them

schoolchildren
across
the
country
are
being
threatened
by
the
vicious
gang
ms-
that
ice
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
by
the
way
is
taking
out
of
the
country
and
dropping
them
back
home
by
the
thousands
another
problem
solved
meanwhile
in
the
real
world
american
border
police
apprehended
migrants
in
may
the
most
recent
month
for
which
data
has
been
officially
released
that
is
the
highest
recorded
number
in
years
and
a
ninefold
increase
from
may
when
border
arrests
were
at
the
lowest
levels
in
nearly
years
preliminary
data
collected
by
the
us
customs
and
border
protection
agency
and
released
by
the
mexican
government
suggests
that
arrests
declined
by
in
june
to
that
decline
might
be
owing
to
a
deal
cut
with
the
mexican
government
after
mr
trump
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
unless
the
migration
surge
subsided
it
might
be
owing
to
the
heat
since
fewer
cross
the
desert
in
summer
yet
this
is
still
more
than
double
the
number
of
people
detained
the
previous
june
an
unusually
large
share
of
recent
arrivals
are
children
according
to
the
migration
policy
institute
a
think-tank
more
than
half
of
those
arriving
at
the
border
are
coming
as
families
and
are
unaccompanied
children
this
all
presents
a
problem
for
american
authorities
after
they
are
apprehended
migrants
are
processed
in
facilities
run
by
the
customs
and
border
patrol
they
are
not
supposed
to
stay
there
for
longer
than
three
days
adults
and
children
who
arrived
with
their
parents
or
guardians
are
then
dispatched
to
facilities
run
by
ice
until
a
hearing
can
be
held
unaccompanied
children
are
supposed
to
be
cared
for
by
a
separate
agency
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
hhs
at
least
that
is
how
it
is
meant
to
work
in
fact
just
judges
nationwide
hear
these
cases
there
are
cases
outstanding
says
trac
a
research
outfit
at
syracuse
university
and
hundreds
of
thousands
more
are
pending
this
logjam
creates
a
problem
across
the
country

city
an
especially
overburdened
court
system
are
being
set
for

the
backlog
of
cases
and
the
unexpected
migration
surge
has
filled
both
ice
and
hhs
facilities
to
overflowing
immigration
detention
centres
were
built
to
handle
single
adult
men
not
to
house
families
and
children
partly
because
of
this
the
border
patrol
is
not
releasing
detainees
to
these
longer-term
facilities
a
doctor
visiting
detained
children
reported
that
they
had
not
been
given
toothpaste
or
soap
and
were
being
kept
in
freezing
rooms
where
the
lights
were
kept
on

visited

in
the
texas
towns

clint
and
mcallen
encountered
babies
who
were
sick
and
losing

and
described
the
conditions
as
comparable
to
torture
facilities
the
border
patrol
has
insisted
that
reports
of
deplorable
conditions
for
migrants
were
exaggerated
that
was
then
contradicted
by
another
report
from
the
department
of
homeland
security's
inspector-general
it
found
detainees
were
being
kept
in
overcrowded
conditions
for
much
longer
than
three
days
many
children
had
been
held
longer
than
a
week
most
of
the
facilities
visited
by
government
inspectors
did
not
give
children
showers
and
little
access
to
fresh
clothing
they
were
not
fed
hot
food
some
adults
were
being
held
in
standing-room-only
conditions
for
as
long
as
a
week
detainees
had
started
to
clog
their
toilets
with
blankets
so
they
could
at
least
leave
their
confinement
while
the
pipes
were
unblocked
they
pressed
notes
to
the
windows
as
the
inspectors
passed
by

congress
has
had
to
scramble
to
respond

th
both
the
republican-led
senate
and
the
democratic-led
house
had
agreed
to
the
figure
requested
by
immigration
agencies
bn
for
emergency
humanitarian
spending
but
they
differed
on
how
it
ought
to
be
spent
the
house
version
of
the
funding
bill
had
more
restrictions
aimed
at
preventing
the

from
using
the
money
to
round
up
more
migrants
after

democrats
revolted
nancy

the
speaker
of
the
house
had
to
concede
defeat
and
pass
the
senate
bill
over
the
howls
of
the
party's
hispanic
caucus
then
a
delegation
from
the
caucus
managed
to
tour
two
of
the
customs
and
border
facilities
they
described
sordid
conditions

the
hispanic
caucus
described
the
border-funding
bill
as
a
betrayal
of
our
american
values
embarrassing
as
this
was
for
ms
pelosi
the
emergency
funding
is
a
temporary
reprieve
for
a
recurring
problem
mr
trump's
administration
has
tried
various
methods
to
quell
the
influx
first
the
short-lived
practice
of
deterring
family
migration
by
separating
children
from
their
parents
now
other
tactics
designed
to
scare
off
potential
migrants
and
the
strong-arming
of
the
mexican
government
into
detaining
many
more
central
americans
on
their
way
to
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
prospective
challengers
vying
to
be
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
are
adopting
ever-leftier
ideas
several
democratic
contenders
have
recently
embraced
decriminalising
border
crossing

position
held
by
juli
n
castro
a
former
federal
housing
secretary
and
primary
candidate
cory
booker
a
senator
from
new
jersey
says
he
would
like
to
virtually
eliminate
immigrant
detention
and
wrote
that
america
must
guarantee
hormone
therapy
for
detained
transgender
migrants
who
seek
asylum
as
mr
trump's
election
showed
sympathy
for
migrants
at
the
southern
border
ebbs
and
flows
but
there
is
always
demand
for
draconian
border
enforcement
democrats
need
to
tread
carefully
china's
