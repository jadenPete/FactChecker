political
speed-dating
in
new
hampshire
the
granite
state's
political
culture
is
wonderfully
strange
spend
more
than
ten
minutes
talking
to
a
political
junkie
in
new
hampshire
and
you
will
hear
some
version
of
this
old
chestnut
ask
a
new
hampshirite
if
he
plans
to
vote
for
candidate
x
for
president
and
he'll
say
i
don't
know
i've
only
seen
her
three
times
the
granite
state
holds
the
first
presidential
primary
iowa
selects
a
candidate
a
week
earlier
but
through
caucuses
rather
than
an
election
so
voters
there
expect
and
receive
in
profusion
face-to-face
contact
with
anyone
who
wants
their
vote
during
a
recent
five-day
stretch
eight
candidates
popped
up
across
the
state
their
appearances
fostered
by
groups
of
dedicated
local
volunteers
this
fits
well
with
the
state's
political
culture
which
is
equal
parts
charming
and
lunatic
larry
drake
who
chairs
the
rockingham
county
democrats
a
republican-leaning
region
in
the
state's
south-eastern
corner
and
reckons
he
has
seen
declared
and
prospective
candidates
so
far
in
this
cycle
explains
that
new
hampshire
has
kept
its
methods
of
political
administration
relatively
unchanged
for
the
past
few
centuries
to
ensure
that
ordinary
citizens
can
take
part
in
the
political
process
the
state
begins
its
legislative
sessions
in
winter
when
farms
lie
fallow
the
bedrock
political
entity
is
the
town
rather
than
the
county
or
region
and
as
in
much
of
new
england
town
boards
of
selectmen
in
effect
powerful
city
councils
make
virtually
all
political
decisions
state
legislators
pay
was
set
at
a
year
in
and
there
it
has
remained
new
hampshire
has
a
famously
libertarian
ethos
it
has
no
income
or
general
sales
tax
preferring
to
gouge
outsiders
with
hefty
hotel
restaurant
and
hire-car
taxes
and
tolls
where
highways
cross
the
state
border
since
the
free
state
project
has
been
asking
libertarians
to
move
to
the
state
to
put
their
ideas
into
practice
somehow
this
ethos
has
produced
a
profusion
of
government
new
hampshire
has
state
legislators
or
one
for
every
residents
of
voting
age
if
california
used
the
same
ratio
it
would
have
a
person
legislature
this
makes
it
not
just
the
biggest
state
legislature
in
america
but
the
third-biggest
legislative
body
in
the
anglophone
world
behind
only
the
united
states
congress
and
britain's
parliament
in
addition
to
the
legislature
and
governor
it
elects
an
executive
council
a
five-member
body
first
convened
in
to
check
the
royal
governor's
power
the
council
today
approves
and
monitors
agency
budgets
and
can
veto
the
governor's
pardons
and
appointments
it
is
in
short
a
state
that
takes
participatory
democracy
seriously
that
is
where
mr
drake
comes
in
he
is
a
compact
genial
retired
labour
economist
who
spent
years
studying
employment
patterns
at
the
bureau
of
labour
statistics
in
washington
dc
before
retiring
to
southern
new
hampshire
he
has
been
politically
active
since
attending
an
anti-war
march
in
and
has
chaired
the
rockingham
county
democrats
for
seven
years
over
breakfast
at
a
country
club
in
atkinson
where
donald
trump
held
one
of
his
last
pre-election
rallies
george
hamblen
a
party
chairman
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
plaistow
credits
mr
drake
with
building
something
out
of
nothing
on
a
recent
presidential-election
map
southern
new
hampshire
is
solidly
republican
republicans
outnumber
democrats
in
of
rockingham's
towns
mr
drake's
job
entails
building
local
party
organs
where
none
existed
before
and
persuading
people
to
run
for
local
office
even
though
they
will
probably
lose
it
helps
that
he
is
a
self-described
people
person
with
a
warm
patient
manner
and
an
easy
laugh
over
one
weekend
in
mid-march
mr
drake
attended
two
town
caucuses
where
local
party
committees
chose
leaders
as
well
as
town
hall
meetings
with
two
presidential
candidates
amy
klobuchar
who
spoke
in
a
gym
at
a
local
school
and
john
hickenlooper
who
made
a
deeply
on-brand
appearance
at
a
deconsecrated
church
that
is
now
a
bar
mr
hickenlooper
once
owned
a
brew
pub
a
caucus
made
mr
drake
miss
a
third
tulsi
gabbard
drew
a
crowd
to
a
public
library
in
plaistow
he
will
undoubtedly
see
them
again
if
they
don't
come
here
says
mr
drake
it's
political
malpractice
new
hampshire
is
small
but
an
early
victory
lets
a
candidate
build
momentum
and
then
a
war-chest
the
state
also
lets
candidates
hone
their
retail
skills
debates
and
huge
rallies
come
later
new
hampshire
events
are
intimate
before
ms
klobuchar
took
the
stage
the
chairman
of
the
rye
democrats
thanked
mr
philbrick
for
letting
us
use
the
bank's
parking
lot
and
asked
how
many
people
had
children
who
played
basketball
in
the
gym
a
lot
of
hands
went
up
asked
which
candidate
he
favours
mr
drake
will
not
be
drawn
i
made
a
conscious
decision
to
be
neutral
in
the
primary
he
explains
the
primary
between
hillary
clinton
and
bernie
sanders
fractured
friendships
and
bad
feelings
lingered
in
between
supporters
of
mrs
clinton
and
barack
obama
most
democrats
seem
to
understand
that
harbouring
grudges
this
year
could
hand
the
white
house
back
to
mr
trump
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
