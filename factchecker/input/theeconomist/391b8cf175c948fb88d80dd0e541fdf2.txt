should
political
parties
really
let
anyone
run
for
president
less
direct
democracy
in
the
nominating
process
might
produce
less
polarisation
more
unity
and
more
qualified
nominees
twenty-five
candidates
are
running
for
the
democratic
party's
nomination
twenty
of
them
will
take
the
stage
in
next
week's
televised
primary
debates
so
large
a
slate
could
fill
two
football
teams
provide
five
sets
of
starters
in
the
nba
or
be
the
primary
cast
for
a
broadway
musical
though
fields
of
this
size
are
atypical
compared
with
primaries
in
the
th
century
they
are
becoming
the
new
normal
see
chart
in
the
republican
field
that
included
donald
trump
contained
other
candidates
party
bosses
recognise
that
having
so
many
choices
overwhelms
voters
and
encourages
candidates
to
take
extreme
positions
but
doing
something
about
it
will
require
them
to
act
in
a
way
that
to
many
seems
undemocratic
the
parties
current
nomination
rules
allow
almost
anyone
who
wishes
to
run
for
president
to
do
so
to
try
to
minimise
the
chaos
this
invites
the
democratic
national
committee
set
minimum
thresholds
in
terms
of
polling
numbers
and
fundraising
that
had
to
be
met
in
order
to
be
included
in
the
televised
debates
these
are
hard
to
calibrate
precisely
in
advance
in
this
case
the
system
has
thrown
up
too
many
candidates
for
voters
to
evaluate
it
rewards
name
recognition
and
social-media
prowess
and
asks
activists
to
make
decisions
about
people
about
whom
they
know
little
absent
from
the
candidates
who
were
selected
for
the
democrats
first
televised
debates
was
steve
bullock
the
governor
of
monatana
and
the
only
democratic
governor
of
a
state
won
by
mr
trump
in
the
race
because
he
was
lower
in
the
polls
and
had
fewer
individual
campaign
donors
than
other
candidates
meanwhile
marianne
williamson
spiritual
guru
whose
assertion
that
there's
no
higher
art
than
living
a
beautiful
life
may
not
be
the
winning
message
democrats
are
searching
for
in
was
allowed
to
speak
on
the
party's
platform
to
millions
of
americans
it
does
not
have
to
be
like
this
party
leaders
used
to
exercise
more
sway
over
primaries
they
could
do
so
again
republicans
and
democrats
lack
of
control
over
their
nominating
process
is
a
uniquely
american
phenomenon
nowhere
else
in
the
world
do
political
parties
engage
in
years-long
campaign
battles
between
candidates
vying
for
the
approval
of
hyper-engaged
partisans
most
other
countries
allow
some
combination
of
legislators
party
members
and
interest
groups
to
select
party
leaders
this
is
the
case
in
parliamentary
democracies
such
as
britain
where
conservative
mps
chose
a
slate
of
two
candidates
to
put
to
party
members
canada
and
australia
as
well
as
in
presidential
systems
like
france
and
mexico
where
most
parties
choose
their
leaders
from
a
more
restricted
list
the
current
system
can
trace
its
roots
back
to
the
democratic
convention
in
miami
beach
this
was
the
first
contest
in
which
the
rules
of
the
mcgovern-fraser
commission
were
adopted
that
commission
was
tasked
with
creating
more
open
rules
after
hubert
humphrey
was
nominated
in
a
contentious
convention
despite
not
competing
in
any
of
primary
races
in
the
five
decades
since
the
adoption
of
more
democratic
rules
the
democratic
party
has
won
fewer
presidential
elections
than
in
the
five
decades
before
when
candidates
were
chosen
in
smoke-filled
rooms
republicans
were
persuaded
by
similar
pro-democracy
arguments
and
enacted
plebiscitary
reforms
in
the
s
and
s
increasing
the
number
of
primaries
at
the
expense
of
caucuses
and
binding
delegates
to
the
voters
decisions
fans
of
the
current
system
consider
it
a
plus
that
the
two
parties
are
open
to
outsiders
like
mr
trump
or
bernie
sanders
they
also
point
out
that
the
candidates
on
the
democratic
side
will
be
winnowed
down
to
a
more
manageable
number
yet
although
candidates
have
already
started
dropping
out
their
reasons
for
doing
so
do
not
suggest
a
process
that
is
working
well
eric
swalwell
a
congressman
suspended
his
campaign
because
he
was
spending
so
much
money
on
fundraising
to
pull
in
enough
individual
donors
to
qualify
for
the
debates
in
one
month
we
spent
ish
to
get
so
it's
like
you're
like
spending
money
to
get
less
money
just
to
meet
a
threshold
mr
swalwell
said
after
dropping
out
of
the
race
he
may
be
no
great
loss
but
if
democrats
lose
mr
bullock
or
michael
bennet
an
impressive
centrist
senator
from
colorado
in
the
next
round
of
winnowing
they
may
find
they
lose
candidates
with
a
good
chance
of
beating
mr
trump
months
before
the
first
actual
primary
takes
place
in
february
elaine
kamarck
of
the
brookings
institution
a
think-tank
and
author
of
primary
politics
everything
you
need
to
know
about
how
america
nominates
its
presidential
candidates
believes
this
system
makes
it
far
too
easy
for
parties
to
be
hijacked
by
outsiders
no
other
political
process
in
the
modern
world
ms
kamarck
writes
has
so
abandoned
this
critical
vetting
function
of
the
political
party
in
the
nominating
process
a
system
of
peer
review
by
elected
officeholders
before
candidates
were
put
before
primary
voters
would
she
argues
work
better
what
would
this
look
like
in
practice
ms
kamarck
presents
three
possible
solutions
first
both
parties
could
increase
the
role
that
superdelegates
convention
delegates
who
can
vote
whichever
way
they
please
play
in
the
process
currently
republicans
do
not
use
superdelegates
in
their
selection
process
and
democrats
have
recently
cut
their
power
second
parties
might
consider
a
national
convention
to
endorse
a
limited
number
of
candidates
before
the
choice
between
them
is
presented
to
the
voters
the
third
option
would
be
to
let
a
party's
members
of
congress
present
a
slate
of
endorsed
candidates
to
primary
voters
julia
azari
an
associate
professor
of
political
science
at
marquette
university
says
that
the
ideal
system
probably
lies
somewhere
between
the
brokered
conventions
of
the
s
and
the
nearly
fully
democratised
system
of
today
it
is
too
late
for
reformers
to
affect
the
system
that
will
be
used
in
but
it
is
not
unimaginable
that
they
may
do
so
later
on
both
parties
already
enact
restrictions
on
who
may
run
and
even
the
constitution
includes
some
anti-democratic
requirements
such
as
the
need
to
be
years
or
older
to
run
for
president
nor
is
it
abnormal
for
the
parties
to
exercise
a
heavy
hand
in
their
nomination
processes
in
the
primary
for
example
the
democratic
national
committee
voted
to
strip
michigan
and
florida
of
all
their
pledged
delegates
after
they
scheduled
their
primary
elections
earlier
in
the
year
than
originally
agreed
the
rules
committees
of
the
two
parties
still
have
the
power
and
flexibility
to
reform
a
system
that
is
failing
to
work
they
should
use
it
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
