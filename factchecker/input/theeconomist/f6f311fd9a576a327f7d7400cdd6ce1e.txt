the
pentagon
changes
its
focus
to
russia
and
china
after
years
of
ieds
in
the
middle
east
america's
armed
forces
are
planning
for
high-tech
warfare
patrick
shanahan
draws
his
finger
down
a
list
of
his
priorities
for
the
pentagon
hypersonics
directed
energy
space
cyber
quantum
science
and
autonomy
it
could
not
be
further
from
the
dusty
battlegrounds
of
the
past
years
when
we
talk
about
space
this
is
not
designed
for
counter-terrorism
he
says
mr
shanahan
a
former
boeing
executive
was
propelled
into
the
job
of
secretary
of
defence
in
january
having
served
as
understudy
to
james
mattis
for
less
than
months
he
has
taken
the
helm
of
an
organisation
that
is
in
the
throes
of
change
as
it
prepares
for
life
after
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
in
january
the
trump
administration
published
its
national
defence
strategy
nds
officials
lamented
that
nearly
two
decades
of
whack-a-mole
against
insurgents
and
jihadists
had
eroded
the
country's
military
edge
resulting
in
exhausted
and
under-trained
units
armed
for
the
wrong
enemy
so
the
nds
decreed
that
america
would
henceforth
focus
on
long-term
strategic
competition
between
nations
namely
china
and
russia
mr
shanahan
was
charged
with
implementing
the
vision
while
mr
mattis
travelled
around
the
world
calming
ruffled
allies
this
is
the
first
time
since
the
reagan
era
where
the
united
states
has
been
motivated
to
modernise
its
war-fighting
architecture
its
technologies
says
michael
griffin
the
pentagon's
technology
chief
the
first
time
we've
been
forced
to
think
about
how
we
fight
war
one
priority
is
to
re-tool
the
armed
forces
with
the
weapons
they
need
mr
griffin
paints
a
picture
of
each
service
wielding
its
own
ultra-fast
and
long-range
hypersonic
missiles
fed
information
from
a
vast
satellite
network
girdling
the
skies
all
of
it
supported
by
a
procurement
process
that
can
spit
out
high-tech
weapons
in
years
rather
than
decades
david
norquist
mr
shanahan's
acting
deputy
and
the
pentagon's
finance
chief
points
to
rising
investments
in
firepower-heavy
platforms
like
the
virginia-class
submarine
and
new
b
bomber
but
he
also
acknowledges
that
big
planes
and
ships
may
not
survive
for
long
under
a
hailstorm
of
chinese
or
russian
missiles
so
money
is
also
going
to
larger
numbers
of
smaller
cheaper
and
dispersible
platforms
like
an
unmanned
boat
the
second
priority
is
ensuring
that
the
armed
forces
not
only
have
the
arms
they
need
but
also
the
training
and
readiness
to
use
them
in
the
sort
of
fighting
they
would
face
in
eastern
europe
and
the
western
pacific
disaster
relief
is
nice
says
one
general
but
this
is
a
warfighting
operation
ryan
mccarthy
undersecretary
of
the
army
says
that
half
his
brigade
combat
teams
freed
from
what
was
an
intense
pace
of
deployments
are
now
at
the
highest
level
of
readiness
up
from
a
small
fraction
of
that
two
years
ago
basic
training
is
being
increased
from
to
weeks
training
and
exercise
scenarios
are
adapting
too
they
increasingly
reflect
large
force-on-force
conflict
against
very
high-end
adversaries
says
john
rood
the
pentagon's
policy
chief
soldiers
who
once
practised
dealing
with
terrorists
roadside
bombs
now
drill
in
dodging
enemy
air
strikes
or
chemical
weapons
the
army
is
raising
new
battalion-sized
forces
one
apiece
for
russia
and
china
which
integrate
cyber
electronic
warfare
and
space
capabilities
skills
that
were
lost
or
neglected
in
the
counter-insurgency
years
a
third
focus
is
changing
what
the
pentagon
actually
does
with
its
troops
planes
and
ships
the
basic
concept
says
mr
rood
is
that
we're
going
to
give
priority
to
the
indo-pacific
he
points
out
that
saw
the
longest
absence
of
an
aircraft
carrier
from
the
persian
gulf
since
two
carriers
were
instead
sent
to
the
pacific
a
working
group
at
the
joint
staff
has
been
poring
through
odd
global
execution
orders
directives
to
commanders
around
the
world
that
have
accumulated
over
the
years
weeding
out
those
which
do
not
fit
with
the
nds's
focus
on
great
power
competition
seven
out
of
eight
advise-and-assist
missions
in
africa
command
have
already
been
cut
central
command
which
covers
everything
from
egypt
to
pakistan
will
have
more
fat
shaved
off
but
rebalancing
is
only
part
of
the
story
the
most
significant
element
of
the
nds
says
mr
shanahan
is
dynamic
force
employment
dfe
in
mil-speak
that
refers
to
moving
forces
around
the
world
quickly
and
unpredictably
to
bamboozle
adversaries
last
year
for
instance
the
uss
harry
s.
truman
an
aircraft-carrier
that
usually
hangs
around
the
middle
east
was
abruptly
called
home
midway
through
her
deployment
cycle
and
then
suddenly
sailed
into
the
arctic
circle
the
first
carrier
to
do
so
in
years
to
join
massive
nato
exercises
for
a
carrier
whose
movements
are
planned
years
ahead
that
is
warp-speed
similar
surprise
deployments
of
bombers
fighter
aircraft
and
surface-to-air
missiles
are
being
planned
under
dfe
despite
all
this
insiders
grumble
that
civilians
have
not
forced
services
to
change
spending
patterns
drastically
enough
rear-admiral
mark
montgomery
former
policy
director
for
the
senate
armed
services
committee
is
concerned
that
the
army
is
still
buying
too
many
vehicles
initially
designed
for
low-end
war
such
as
light
tanks
chris
brose
the
committee's
former
staff
director
says
the
pentagon
is
not
doing
anywhere
near
enough
to
develop
build
and
test
the
huge
numbers
of
autonomous
unmanned
systems
it
needs
mr
shanahan
urges
sceptics
to
wait
for
the
budget
which
he
has
called
a
masterpiece
what
you'll
see
in
these
budgets
is
a
sizeable
investment
in
these
critical
technologies
and
programmes
whether
it's
autonomy
artificial
intelligence
hypersonics
cyber
the
critics
haven't
had
exposure
to
those
plans
yet
he
adds
coyly
that
there's
a
good
portion
of
the
budget
you
won't
ever
see
implying
that
more
radical
efforts
may
be
buried
in
classified
spending
and
he
is
confident
that
he
can
remould
a
strong
bureaucracy
people
like
myself
we
spend
our
whole
life
implementing
we
know
how
to
move
large
organisations
we
know
where
to
place
our
bets
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
