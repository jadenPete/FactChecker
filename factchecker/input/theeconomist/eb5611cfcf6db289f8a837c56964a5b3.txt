swatting
could
become
a
federal
crime
false
reports
leading
to
swat
team
deployments
have
doubled
since
anyone
tempted
to
cry
wolf
might
ponder
the
fate
of
tyler
barriss
on
january
th
a
federal
judge
will
sentence
the
californian
to
at
least
years
in
prison
for
dozens
of
hoax
emergency
calls
including
one
which
resulted
in
the
police
in
wichita
kansas
fatally
shooting
an
innocent
and
unarmed
young
father
but
while
mr
barriss's
mischief-making
is
over
at
least
for
a
spell
police
swat
special
weapons
and
tactics
teams
which
make
use
of
military
hardware
and
techniques
can
expect
plenty
more
swatting
calls
as
bogus
reports
of
violence
have
become
known
due
to
the
lack
of
a
uniform
reporting
category
no
nationwide
tally
exists
but
kevin
kolbye
a
former
fbi
swatting
expert
who
is
now
assistant
police
chief
of
arlington
texas
reckons
annual
swatting
incidents
have
climbed
from
roughly
in
to
more
than
today
part
of
this
increase
can
be
chalked
up
to
smartphone
apps
and
online
services
that
mask
a
caller's
location
and
identity
diminishing
the
risk
of
the
swatter
being
caught
another
factor
is
the
popularity
of
streaming
videogame
play
to
an
online
audience
a
swatter
who
targets
a
rival
gamer
during
a
streaming
session
can
watch
the
victim's
reaction
as
his
room
is
stormed
by
cops
in
tactical
gear
weapons
drawn
the
voyeuristic
frisson
thus
obtained
seems
to
have
outclassed
the
thrill
of
generating
a
news
report
of
a
swat
raid
on
a
celebrity's
home
an
approach
that
was
more
common
in
years
past
stars
subjected
to
a
swatting
include
justin
bieber
russell
brand
tom
cruise
miley
cyrus
clint
eastwood
and
paris
hilton
most
swatters
then
are
seeking
kicks
or
the
settling
of
a
score
some
however
are
pursuing
profit
drug
dealers
sometimes
swat
rivals
hoping
their
unexpected
brush
with
the
law
will
end
up
reducing
competition
says
robert
pusins
who
until
recently
worked
for
the
sheriff's
office
in
broward
county
florida
the
risk
of
violence
seems
to
rise
in
the
swatting
of
victims
who
have
not
committed
a
crime
in
the
confusion
of
a
raid
a
law-abiding
citizen
is
more
likely
to
reckon
that
his
home
must
be
under
attack
by
thugs
thus
unnerved
he
is
more
likely
to
brandish
and
use
a
weapon
which
may
draw
police
fire
mr
kolbye
says
during
the
response
to
a
fake
bomb
threat
in
the
police
chief
of
sentinel
oklahoma
was
shot
four
times
by
a
resident
who
investigators
said
was
not
charged
because
he
believed
the
intrusion
was
criminal
a
ballistic
vest
saved
the
officer's
life
of
late
swatters
seem
to
have
become
better
at
making
their
calls
appear
to
come
from
near
the
supposed
scene
of
the
crime
says
carrie
braun
spokeswoman
for
the
sheriff's
office
in
orange
county
california
but
even
fishy
reports
of
violence
must
be
treated
as
real
we
will
always
respond
she
says
all
this
hits
taxpayers
hard
the
bill
for
a
swat
raid
complete
with
bomb
squad
and
paramedics
can
run
into
six
figures
according
to
the
michigan
association
of
police
more
than
a
few
swatters
end
up
bragging
online
an
unwise
move
to
make
prosecuting
them
easier
congresswoman
katherine
clark
a
massachusetts
democrat
is
pushing
a
bill
in
congress
that
would
make
swatting
a
federal
crime
in
not
long
after
she
had
introduced
the
initial
version
of
the
legislation
police
with
rifles
appeared
outside
her
house
near
boston
a
caller
had
said
that
a
shooter
was
inside
her
home
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist

re-elected
as
indonesia's

go
what
to
expect
from

court's
