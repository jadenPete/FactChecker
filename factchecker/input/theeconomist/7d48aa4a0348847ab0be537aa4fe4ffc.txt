the
rise
in
american
high-school
graduation
rates
looks
puffed-up
online
credit-recovery
classes
have
been
implicated
in
many
school
scandals
the
public
high
schools
in
washington
dc
were
once
looked
on
with
wonder
overcoming
deep-seated
poverty
three
in
four
pupils
are
classified
as
poor
and
racial
segregation
the
district
dramatically
increased
its
graduation
rate
in
only
of
high-school
students
graduated
by
that
rate
had
climbed
to
arne
duncan
barack
obama's
education
secretary
touted
the
district's
results
as
an
example
of
what
can
happen
when
schools
embrace
innovative
reforms
then
the
truth
emerged
it
began
with
media
reports
on
shenanigans
at
ballou
high
school
an
all-minority
and
entirely
poor
high
school
in
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
nation's
capital
graduation
rates
had
gone
from
in
to
in
when
auditors
examined
the
district's
records
they
found
that
of
all
diplomas
in
year
were
improperly
awarded
many
went
to
students
who
seldom
showed
up
at
school
graduation
rates
at
ballou
have
since
sunk
back
to
earth
nationally
high-school
graduation
rates
have
increased
at
a
steady
clip
even
while
other
measures
of
learning
and
achievement
international
exams
state-mandated
standardised
tests
college-admissions
test
scores
have
been
flat
or
even
slightly
negative
that
could
be
because
children
are
doing
better
or
because
schools
are
lowering
standards
there
are
some
pockets
of
real
success
high-performing
charters
in
cities
have
helped
many
poor
minority
students
most
at
risk
of
dropping
out
if
left
in
traditional
public
schools
but
for
the
rest
of
the
country
the
warning
lights
are
starting
to
flash
the
state
of
alabama
which
posted
a
remarkable
percentage-point
increase
in
graduation
rates
between
and
has
since
admitted
that
its
numbers
were
inflated
from
charlotte
north
carolina
and
atlanta
georgia
to
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
credible
accusations
of
graduation-rate
inflation
have
emerged
an
ever-present
element
in
these
stories
is
the
reliance
on
online
credit-recovery
classes
these
are
remedial
courses
delivered
via
computer
that
students
can
take
if
they
fail
a
class
rather
than
attending
summer
school
or
being
forced
to
repeat
a
grade
jeremy
noonan
a
former
science
teacher
in
douglas
county
georgia
was
assigned
to
supervise
a
credit-recovery
course
in
mr
noonan
says
a
colleague
told
him
that
his
responsibility
was
to
manage
the
course
so
that
students
received
an
average
grade
of
or
higher
which
would
enable
them
to
graduate
even
if
they
failed
the
end-of-term
exams
the
computer
programme
doing
the
teaching
allowed
students
to
retake
exams
they
failed
with
many
of
the
same
questions
i
realised
right
away
it
was
all
about
manipulating
the
system
he
says
most
teachers
just
gave
the
students
the
answers
without
bothering
to
explain
the
course
content
says
ayde
davis
a
former
public-school
teacher
in
del
rio
texas
who
reported
violations
to
the
state
education
agency
students
could
finish
their
courses
at
accelerated
rates
the
administration
was
happy
and
credit-recovery
teachers
who
co-operated
were
feted
students
completed
exams
at
unreasonably
fast
speeds
one
finished
a
physics
exam
in
four
minutes
and
earned
an
score
according
to
records
she
saved
in
the
school
year
credits
were
given
for
recovery
courses
completed
in
less
than
ten
hours
ms
davis's
documents
show
according
to
the
makers
of
credit-recovery
software
each
course
has
between
and
hours
of
instruction
it
is
not
possible
to
know
how
many
credit-recovery
programmes
are
being
used
as
diploma
mills
but
these
courses
are
now
widespread
the
fordham
institute
an
education
think-tank
estimates
that
of
all
high
schools
in
america
use
them
some
high
schools
have
more
than
half
of
their
students
enrolled
in
credit-recovery
programmes
they
are
especially
popular
in
urban
high
schools
attended
by
poor
and
minority
students
in
other
words
