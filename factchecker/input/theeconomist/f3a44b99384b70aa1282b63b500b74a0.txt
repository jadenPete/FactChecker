new
research
probes
eviction's
causes
and
consequences
a
reinvigorated
debate
focuses
on
the
link
between
housing
instability
and
poverty
at
nine
o'clock
on
a
recent
friday
some
people
mostly
black
waited
on
pew-like
benches
for
the
start
of
their
eviction
cases
at
housing
court
the
few
lawyers
in
attendance
all
white
were
present
to
bring
the
day's
cases
on
behalf
of
landlords
often
several
dozen
at
a
time
the
people
who
did
not
show
up
for
court
received
default
eviction
orders
in
the
span
of
a
few
minutes
those
present
could
choose
to
mount
legal
defences
most
did
not
similar
scenes
play
out
almost
daily
in
courtrooms
across
the
country
in
there
were
an
estimated
m
eviction
cases
filed
in
america
and
nearly
completed
according
to
the
eviction
lab
a
research
outfit
at
princeton
university
led
by
matthew
desmond
a
sociologist
his
bestselling
book
evicted
poverty
and
profit
in
the
american
city
argues
that
eviction
is
a
cause
not
just
a
condition
of
poverty
it
won
the
pulitzer
prize
in
and
has
reinvigorated
the
neglected
field
of
eviction
research
it
is
rare
for
a
sociology
book
to
be
widely
read
let
alone
acted
on
yet
since
the
publication
of
mr
desmond's
book
new
york
city
has
become
the
first
place
to
guarantee
a
right
to
legal
counsel
in
eviction
proceedings
like
several
other
cities
it
has
also
strengthened
its
emergency
rental-assistance
programme
the
city's
eviction
numbers
have
plummeted
from
a
high
of
in
to
just
in
landlords
have
the
right
to
enforce
tenants
legal
obligation
to
pay
rent
almost
all
eviction
filings
are
caused
by
a
tenant
failing
to
meet
these
obligations
yet
it
has
become
clear
that
the
engine
behind
evictions
is
poverty
and
that
they
are
bad
for
tenants
the
looming
question
for
researchers
now
is
how
bad
housing
instability
wrecks
credit
histories
and
disrupts
work
and
school
seeing
one's
possessions
thrown
onto
the
street
can
be
scarring
but
quantifying
the
effects
on
tenants
and
consequently
the
benefit
of
forestalling
evictions
is
difficult
that
is
because
those
facing
removal
from
their
homes
are
often
already
in
dire
straits
however
economists
have
recently
found
that
the
financial
consequences
of
eviction
look
less
dismal
than
might
be
expected
in
a
recent
working
paper
from
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
entitled
does
eviction
cause
poverty
four
economists
examined
every
eviction
filing
made
in
cook
county
which
includes
the
city
of
chicago
the
researchers
compared
financial
outcomes
for
tenants
who
were
evicted
with
those
who
were
not
they
found
that
both
groups
were
in
remarkably
poor
financial
shape
in
the
years
leading
up
to
their
eviction
cases
they
both
remained
similarly
destitute
in
the
years
after
taking
advantage
of
the
random
assignment
of
judges
some
of
whom
are
more
lenient
than
others
also
let
the
researchers
isolate
the
unique
effect
of
eviction
on
measures
such
as
credit
scores
debt
loads
use
of
payday
lenders
and
neighbourhood
poverty
levels
as
expected
the
authors
found
negative
effects
on
people
who
had
been
evicted
but
these
were
not
very
large
credit
scores
declined
somewhat
yet
debt
out
for
collection
use
of
payday
lenders
and
neighbourhood
poverty
levels
appeared
unchanged
regardless
of
whether
residents
had
been
evicted
or
not
the
small
causal
impacts
mean
that
merely
avoiding
the
eviction
itself
is
unlikely
to
alleviate
a
lot
of
the
financial
distress
that
low-income
tenants
are
facing
says
winnie
van
dijk
an
economist
at
the
university
of
chicago
who
is
also
one
of
the
study's
authors
the
unfortunate
event
of
an
eviction
in
their
view
is
better
understood
as
a
culminating
indicator
of
long
multi-year
financial
strains
another
recent
study
by
robert
collinson
and
davin
reed
two
economists
applied
a
similar
methodology
to
research
on
evictions
in
new
york
they
found
very
small
negative
effects
on
evicted
residents
employment
and
earnings
at
the
same
time
they
did
not
see
markedly
higher
use
of
government
benefits
such
as
welfare
or
food
stamps
overall
these
results
suggest
that
formal
evictions
may
have
a
quantitatively
small
direct
effect
on
poverty
they
wrote
still
an
eviction
seemed
to
increase
the
chances
of
using
both
homeless
shelters
and
hospitals
for
mental-health
treatment
uniquely
among
american
cities
new
york
maintains
a
right
to
shelter
for
all
homeless
residents
including
single
adults
which
may
explain
some
of
the
findings
it
is
possible
that
evictions
may
not
substantially
worsen
the
financial
states
of
those
at
risk
even
if
eviction
does
not
appear
to
trigger
calamitous
financial
insecurity
if
only
because
it
was
pre-existing
that
does
not
mean
the
newfound
attention
to
the
problem
is
undeserved
homelessness
and
hospitalisation
present
enormous
costs
to
the
rest
of
society
in
new
york
the
typical
eviction
case
is
filed
over
back
rent
of
this
amount
pales
in
comparison
with
the
the
city
spends
on
each
homeless
resident
each
year
the
long-run
consequences
of
eviction
on
poor
children
have
not
yet
been
thoroughly
studied
but
are
unlikely
to
be
good
what
the
new
findings
suggest
is
that
intervention
should
not
happen
only
when
a
case
is
filed
in
housing
court
the
nascent
movement
towards
providing
free
legal
counsel
by
right
is
a
good
one
because
tenants
with
lawyers
are
able
to
negotiate
better
terms
but
measures
such
as
these
can
only
slow
the
pace
of
evictions
they
will
continue
because
for
a
significant
share
of
the
population
particularly
for
black
women
whose
incomes
remain
low
housing
costs
remain
high
and
access
to
housing
subsidies
remains
sporadic
the
second
problem
might
be
the
most
immediately
remedied
if
there
was
the
will
approximately
one
in
four
americans
who
are
poor
enough
to
qualify
for
rental
vouchers
actually
receive
them
because
housing
assistance
is
not
an
entitlement
instead
it
is
a
literal
lottery
in
which
a
mere
of
randomly
selected
hopefuls
receive
vouchers
the
losers
get
nothing
and
the
waiting
list
for
a
voucher
in
high-cost
areas
such
as
washington
dc
is
more
than
a
decade
long
there's
a
hollowing
out
says
daniel
clark
a
lawyer
at
rising
for
justice
a
free
service
which
provides
advice
to
tenants
facing
eviction
those
people
who
do
qualify
have
been
insulated
but
those
who
do
not
get
squeezed
out
he
adds
when
asked
where
those
people
go
mr
clark
gestures
to
an
elderly
black
man
who
has
just
shuffled
into
the
hallway
dragging
a
suitcase
he
was
a
former
client
who
had
been
evicted
but
is
now
homeless
every
few
days
he
comes
by
to
linger
