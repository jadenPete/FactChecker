the
democratic
front-runners
respond
to
the
green
new
deal
a
loopy
policy
has
moved
the
debate
in
a
helpful
direction
one
of
elizabeth
warren's
formative
political
tangles
which
prompted
her
move
from
law
professor
at
harvard
to
senator
from
massachusetts
occurred
in
over
a
bankruptcy
reform
bill
ms
warren
was
concerned
about
the
repercussions
for
middle-class
americans
especially
women
who
would
have
a
harder
time
filing
for
bankruptcy
as
a
result
of
the
bill
a
particular
target
of
her
ire
was
joe
biden
then
a
senator
from
delaware
and
one
of
the
bill's
strongest
backers
senators
like
joe
biden
should
not
be
allowed
to
sell
out
women
in
the
morning
and
be
heralded
as
their
friend
in
the
evening
she
wrote
at
the
time
to
this
day
the
two
are
seen
as
ideological
foes
ms
warren
appeals
to
the
left
of
the
party
while
mr
biden
has
made
a
concerted
effort
to
court
moderate
democratic
voters
yet
both
contenders
who
are
placed
second
and
first
respectively
in
the
democratic
field
in
yougov's
most
recent
poll
for
the
economist
have
released
environmental
plans
the
striking
similarity
of
their
schemes
shows
how
the
politics
of
climate
change
has
evolved
from
a
niche
issue
among
democrats
to
one
of
great
urgency
those
who
called
for
a
green
new
deal
particularly
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
a
first-term
congresswoman
from
new
york
can
claim
some
credit
for
this
change
a
series
of
recent
calamitous
weather
events
fires
polar
vortices
hurricanes
and
floods
has
also
helped
in
a
recent
yougov
poll
of
democrats
said
the
environment
was
the
most
important
issue
for
them
that
is
second
only
to
health
care
the
green
new
deal
as
first
proposed
had
two
problems
the
first
is
that
it
was
only
a
sketch
with
handwaving
in
lieu
of
detail
on
the
massive
economic
reorganisation
it
envisages
the
second
is
that
it
included
a
gratuitous
list
of
progressive
measures
including
a
federal
jobs
guarantee
universal
basic
income
and
universal
health
insurance
that
are
only
tangentially
related
to
climate
policy
many
top-tier
democratic
candidates
who
would
no
doubt
balk
at
such
sweeping
changes
signed
on
to
the
green
new
deal
nonetheless
yet
with
the
release
of
mr
biden's
and
ms
warren's
plans
both
less
quixotic
and
more
scrupulous
than
the
earlier
sketches
the
debate
is
much
improved
mr
biden
was
one
of
the
few
leading
democratic
contenders
to
resist
endorsing
the
green
new
deal
he
would
instead
release
his
own
climate
plan
he
said
an
adviser's
comment
that
mr
biden
was
seeking
a
middle
ground
gave
rise
to
grumbling
among
activists
that
his
would
be
a
mishmash
that
offered
carbon
taxes
for
liberals
and
fracking
subsidies
for
conservatives
in
fact
mr
biden's
plan
is
more
ambitious
he
would
like
the
american
economy
to
be
a
net-zero
emitter
of
carbon
pollution
by
this
would
be
achieved
in
two
ways
including
executive
orders
and
actions
taking
barack
obama's
playbook
for
climate
policy
and
applying
it
much
more
aggressively
that
would
bypass
congress
the
second
way
which
would
require
legislation
is
through
trn
in
federal
funding
for
what
mr
biden
calls
a
clean
energy
revolution
there
are
other
proposals
in
there
too
like
developing
high-speed
rail
and
reforming
zoning
to
encourage
more
dense
energy-efficient
cities
one
innovation
is
to
threaten
tariffs
on
countries
without
adequate
environmental
policies
america
accounts
for
of
the
world's
greenhouse-gas
emissions
china
accounts
for
nearly
twice
that
mr
biden's
language
on
this
point
he
says
he
wants
strong
new
measures
to
stop
other
countries
from
cheating
on
their
climate
commitments
sounds
almost
trumpian
given
that
mr
biden
is
the
clear
front-runner
for
the
nomination
this
perhaps
paves
the
way
for
a
future
attack
on
the
president
for
focusing
his
trade
actions
on
the
wrong
problem
climate
change
is
a
more
serious
problem
for
america's
future
than
illegal
immigration
or
bilateral
trade
deficits
mr
biden
could
credibly
argue
ms
warren's
plan
has
a
trumpian
echo
too
it
was
released
under
the
banner
of
economic
patriotism
it
represents
according
to
her
my
commitment
to
a
green
new
deal
one
that
applies
the
analogy
of
wartime
mobilisation
during
franklin
roosevelt's
presidency
to
modern
times
hers
is
straightforward
industrial
policy
calling
for
trn
of
investment
over
the
next
ten
years
for
research
and
development
with
three-quarters
of
that
vast
sum
spent
through
federal
procurement
ms
warren
thinks
that
all
this
production
would
generate
m
jobs
which
would
pay
at
least
per
hour
and
guarantee
weeks
of
paid
family
and
medical
leave
about
bn
of
the
money
would
be
spent
on
a
green
marshall
plan
dedicated
to
exporting
the
clean-energy
technology
developed
in
america
to
other
countries
curiously
both
proposals
dodge
the
question
of
a
price
on
carbon
whether
through
direct
taxation
or
a
cap-and-trade
scheme
though
research
into
more
cost-effective
technology
for
carbon
capture
and
sequestration
or
solar
power
is
helpful
and
necessary
a
carbon
price
incorporating
the
negative
externality
of
pollution
would
seem
a
simple
first
step
mr
biden's
plan
only
nods
towards
the
principle
that
polluters
must
bear
the
full
cost
of
the
carbon
pollution
they
are
emitting
and
says
nothing
more
on
the
subject
ms
warren's
plan
does
not
mention
it
at
all
both
candidates
employ
clever
staffers
who
know
about
carbon
pricing
but
they
also
employ
strategists
who
note
that
carbon
taxes
are
easily
dismissed
as
energy
taxes
by
political
opponents
the
lessons
of
when
a
democratic
effort
to
create
a
carbon
market
collapsed
despite
unified
control
of
government
leading
to
an
electoral
backlash
have
been
well
learned
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
