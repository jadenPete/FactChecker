phone
manufacturers
have
taken
note
of
their
customers
woes
in
its
latest
software
release
apple
has
made
it
possible
for
iphone
users
to
send
all
unknown
callers
to
voicemail
automatically
although
the
feature
will
no
doubt
prove
useful
to
the
millions
of
customers
whose
peaceful
suppers
are
ruined
by
fake
calls
it
could
be
disastrous
for
the
faltering
public-polling
industry
the
challenges
telephone
pollsters
face
have
been
growing
polling
by
phone
has
become
very
expensive
as
the
number
of
americans
willing
to
respond
to
unexpected
or
unknown
callers
has
dropped
back
in
the
mid-to-late-
th
century
response
rates
were
as
high
as
according
to
ssrs
a
market
research
and
polling
firm
but
the
pew
research
centre
estimates
that
it
received
completed
interviews
from
a
mere
of
the
people
it
tried
to
survey
in
although
polls
with
low
response
rates
can
still
be
accurate
their
costs
increase
dramatically
as
pollsters
must
spend
more
time
and
money
calling
more
people
according
to
the
american
association
for
public
opinion
research
a
traditional
high-quality
survey
of
americans
costs
roughly
apple's
new
call-blocking
feature
could
push
costs
and
response
rates
into
more
perilous
territory
robert
griffin
research
director
for
the
democracy
fund
voter
study
group
a
group
of
public-opinion
researchers
says
the
software
poses
an
existential
problem
with
call-blocking
the
barrier
to
carrying
out
good
polls
shifts
from
people
not
picking
up
their
phones
to
people
not
even
getting
the
call
at
all
analysts
do
not
even
know
precisely
how
the
new
technology
will
affect
the
industry
but
with
response
rates
already
falling
sharply
whatever
is
in
store
for
pollsters
cannot
be
good
mr
griffin
does
his
best
to
see
a
bright
side
the
challenges
of
phone-based
public-opinion
polling
could
spur
researchers
to
adopt
newer
more
innovative
methods
including
online
polls
they
are
cheaper
and
quicker
than
telephone
surveys
and
provide
a
better
framework
for
studying
americans
attitudes
and
behaviour
surveys
conducted
over
the
internet
allow
researchers
to
check
in
on
the
same
individuals
over
time
a
method
that
allows
pollsters
to
conduct
what
they
call
panel
surveys
to
measure
actual
changes
in
opinions
and
to
focus
on
smaller
sections
of
the
population
both
these
practices
are
close
to
unaffordable
for
all
but
the
best-funded
telephone
pollsters
the
future
of
polling
has
yet
to
be
determined
it
pays
to
be
nimble
mr
griffin
says
online
surveys
rely
on
complex
statistical
adjustments
called
weighting
to
ensure
the
demographics
of
their
respondents
match
the
overall
portrait
of
americans
at
present
this
strategy
is
working
but
only
because
americans
political
behaviour
is
closely
related
to
their
demographic
group
african-americans
and
whites
differ
on
who
they
want
as
president
as
do
voters
with
and
without
college
degrees
changes
in
those
correspondences
can
catch
pollsters
off-guard
researchers
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
neglected
to
take
education
into
account
when
weighting
their
polls
for
the
presidential
election
over-counting
degree-holders
they
predicted
hillary
clinton
would
beat
donald
trump
in
the
state
by
percentage
points
in
the
end
she
won
by
points
the
truth
is
that
surveying
people
is
hard
mr
griffin
says
and
any
single
solution
is
probably
going
to
be
inadequate
the
only
way
to
future-proof
the
public-polling
industry
is
to
experiment
constantly
with
new
technologies
many
organisations
are
doing
just
that
because
of
the
speed
of
technological
change
the
ones
that
are
not
will
soon
be
forced
to
follow
suit
or
shut
their
doors
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's

go
what
to
expect
