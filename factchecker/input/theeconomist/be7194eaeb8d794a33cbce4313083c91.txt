congress
discovers
a
bill
with
bipartisan
support
that
the
president
will
sign
a
measure
to
modestly
reduce
incarceration
looks
likely
to
become
law
tough
anti-crime
rhetoric
has
been
part
of
donald
trump's
public
persona
for
decades
well
before
he
ran
for
office
in
he
took
out
full-page
ads
in
new
york
papers
that
said
muggers
and
murderers
should
be
forced
to
suffer
and
when
they
kill
they
should
be
executed
for
their
crimes
he
announced
his
candidacy
by
inveighing
against
mexicans
bringing
crime
then
courted
support
from
rank-and-file
police
officers
his
first
attorney-general
jeff
sessions
was
a
hoary
drug
warrior
who
reversed
justice
department
efforts
to
help
police
departments
reform
and
to
send
fewer
people
to
prison
william
barr
mr
sessions's
prospective
replacement
has
similar
views
in
he
chaired
a
commission
in
virginia
that
recommended
longer
imprisonment
and
the
abolition
of
parole
but
mr
trump
has
also
been
receptive
to
personal
arguments
against
harsh
criminal-justice
policies
at
the
urging
of
kim
kardashian
a
fellow
reality-television
star
he
commuted
the
life
sentence
of
alice
marie
johnson
a
year-old
woman
imprisoned
for
money
laundering
and
drug
trafficking
and
at
the
urging
of
his
son-in-law
and
adviser
jared
kushner
he
has
become
an
unlikely
champion
of
the
first
step
act
a
criminal-justice
bill
with
bipartisan
support
reversing
an
earlier
decision
mitch
mcconnell
the
senate
majority
leader
said
he
would
bring
it
up
for
a
vote
before
the
end
of
despite
gripes
from
some
on
the
right
who
deem
it
too
soft
on
criminals
and
some
on
the
left
who
feel
it
does
not
go
far
enough
its
passage
looks
likely
that's
right
a
bipartisan
bill
will
probably
make
it
through
congress
and
then
be
signed
by
the
president
the
first
step
act
is
a
sentencing-reform
bill
that
repeals
some
of
the
harsher
federal
laws
passed
in
the
s
and
s
in
congress
passed
the
fair
sentencing
act
which
among
other
things
reduced
the
sentencing
disparity
between
convictions
for
crack
and
powdered
cocaine
the
first
step
act
would
make
that
measure
retroactive
allowing
nearly
offenders
imprisoned
for
crack-cocaine
offences
to
petition
judges
for
early
release
it
would
also
reduce
the
mandatory-minimum
sentence
for
serious
drug
felonies
from
to
years
and
for
conviction
on
a
third
drug-trafficking
or
violent
felony
from
life
to
years
judges
would
have
more
discretion
to
sentence
people
with
minor
previous
convictions
to
less
than
the
mandatory
minimum
at
present
they
can
exercise
that
discretion
only
for
non-violent
drug
offenders
with
no
criminal
history
according
to
an
estimate
from
the
congressional
budget
office
more
than
people
a
year
would
be
affected
by
that
safety
valve
expansion
prisoners
would
no
longer
be
sent
to
facilities
more
than
miles
from
their
homes
and
pregnant
prisoners
would
no
longer
be
shackled
the
bill
allows
some
prisoners
though
not
those
convicted
of
most
violent
crimes
to
earn
time
off
their
sentences
by
participating
in
rehabilitative
programmes
and
it
expands
federal
funding
for
job-training
and
educational
programming
in
prisons
more
elderly
and
terminally
ill
prisoners
would
be
eligible
for
compassionate
release
and
all
prisoners
would
be
able
to
reduce
their
time
in
prison
by
up
to
days
per
year
of
their
sentence
for
good
behaviour
the
brennan
centre
a
think-tank
and
advocacy
group
estimates
the
bill
would
result
in
the
release
around
prisoners
and
shorten
sentences
for
roughly
more
though
welcome
this
would
only
nibble
at
the
prison
population
roughly
m
people
are
imprisoned
in
america
less
than
of
them
are
in
federal
prisons
and
federal
prisoners
are
the
only
ones
affected
by
the
first
step
act's
reforms
see
chart
still
inimai
chettiar
of
the
brennan
centre
calls
the
bill
a
good
compromise
the
resigned
view
held
by
many
advocates
of
criminal-justice
reform
given
the
rhetoric
of
mr
trump
and
policies
set
by
messrs
sessions
and
barr
it
is
probably
as
much
as
anyone
could
hope
for
from
this
administration
it
may
also
encourage
democrats
particularly
those
eyeing
a
presidential
run
to
argue
for
bolder
reforms
even
this
modest
change
has
its
critics
jonathan
thompson
executive
director
of
the
national
sheriffs
association
calls
the
bill
a
giant
social
experiment
and
argues
for
rational
prison
reform
that
doesn't
just
let
people
out
hoping
they
won't
recidivate
tom
cotton
a
republican
senator
from
arkansas
who
has
previously
said
that
america
has
an
under-incarceration
problem
blasted
the
first
step
act
for
allowing
early
release
for
many
categories
of
serious
violent
criminals
yet
while
carjackers
and
bank
robbers
would
indeed
be
eligible
for
sentence
reduction
by
completing
job-training
and
educational
programmes
mr
cotton
is
conflating
early
release
with
early
transfer
to
pre-release
custody
the
federal
prison
system
does
not
just
wash
its
hands
of
violent
criminals
who
manage
to
chip
away
at
their
sentences
they
are
instead
sent
to
halfway
houses
home
confinement
with
ankle-monitoring
and
other
types
of
supervised
conditional
release
the
bill's
opponents
may
find
themselves
shouting
into
the
wind
a
version
of
the
first
step
act
passed
the
republican-controlled
house
in
may
by
votes
to
and
may
have
as
many
as
supporters
in
the
senate
that
will
displease
mr
cotton
as
it
will
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouths
of
reform
advocates
who
wanted
more
but
that
is
the
nature
of
compromise
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
