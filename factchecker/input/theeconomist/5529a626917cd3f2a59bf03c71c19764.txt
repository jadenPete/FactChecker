what
the
mighty
dolphins
say
about
america
lessons
in
national
well-being
from
a
well-run
neighbourhood
swim
team
the
dolphins
contested
their
final
meet
of
the
summer
last
weekend
it
was
an
away
contest
so
held
at
the
neighbourhood
pool
of
a
different
maryland
suburb
from
lexington's
own
yet
it
was
much
the
same
as
the
dozen
meets
home
and
away
his
local
swim
team
had
competed
in
since
mid-june
there
was
an
early
start
with
swimmers
aged
required
for
warm-up
laps
by
am
swim
parents
mostly
both
parents
of
each
dolphins
swimmer
meanwhile
gathered
in
knee-length
shorts
and
polo
shirts
to
commiserate
one
another
on
the
early
morning
scramble
then
there
was
the
national
anthem
typically
sung
by
a
child
because
how
many
adults
can
manage
and
the
rockets
red
glare
but
this
time
played
by
a
teenage
swimmer
on
her
cello
several
hundred
parents
and
children
turned
solemnly
towards
the
national
flag
hanging
limp
by
the
pool
with
hands
and
goggles
on
hearts
then
to
a
burst
of
pop
music
and
cheesy
wisecracks
from
the
announcer
starters
timers
and
stroke-and-turn
judges
took
their
places
and
the
first
row
of
swimmers
took
their
marks
of
the
many
benefits
america
has
bestowed
on
your
british
columnist
few
beat
the
dolphins
the
neighbourhood
swim
team
is
one
of
his
family's
main
shared
activities
the
feeling
of
amused
satisfaction
as
the
boys
hands
reach
for
their
hearts
during
the
anthem
never
fades
it
also
affords
them
superb
competition
powered
by
its
local
teams
swimming
is
huge
in
maryland
its
swimmers
won
more
golds
at
the
olympics
than
australia
the
dolphins
and
their
home
pool
on
the
edge
of
washington
dc
are
also
a
source
of
friendships
part-funded
by
a
portion
of
the
local
property
taxes
they
are
the
heart
of
a
community
that
is
surprisingly
close-knit
given
how
busy
and
itinerant
its
residents
are
this
makes
the
dolphins
an
example
of
tocquevillean
america
a
nation
of
strong
communities
founded
on
voluntary
service
well-heeled
suburbs
are
where
it
still
thrives
that
might
seem
unlikely
american
wonks
have
fretted
about
declining
civic
participation
since
the
publication
of
robert
putnam's
groundbreaking
study
bowling
alone
two
decades
ago
the
main
explanations
included
growing
work
pressure
mainly
because
of
women's
entry
into
the
workforce
and
the
decline
of
social
institutions
such
as
mainline
protestant
churches
and
as
those
factors
have
proved
unremitting
so
the
decline
has
continued
figures
released
by
the
bureau
of
labour
statistics
suggest
a
quarter
of
americans
volunteer
for
community
or
charitable
endeavours
a
proportion
that
is
high
by
rich-world
standards
but
america's
lowest
level
for
two
decades
most
troublingly
the
decline
is
steepest
in
small
towns
and
rural
areas
whose
communities
were
once
ironclad
yet
the
overall
volume
of
voluntary
service
has
held
up
in
part
because
well-educated
suburbanites
such
as
your
columnist's
neighbours
are
doing
more
of
it
the
effort
behind
the
dolphins
illustrates
this
the
team's
director
jeff
mascott
estimates
that
almost
all
the
parents
of
around
swimmers
contribute
somehow
and
he
knows
who
does
not
around
have
a
formal
role
a
similar
number
volunteer
informally
as
timers
or
by
providing
meals
the
uncommon
property-tax
arrangement
is
a
huge
advantage
yet
the
biggest
investment
in
the
team
is
parental
time
this
setup
gives
rise
to
a
few
heroes
when
not
running
the
dolphins
and
until
recently
the
local
road
race
a
soccer
team
and
various
things
at
church
mr
mascott
manages
a
company
and
four
children
his
wife
is
merely
a
law
professor
who
helps
with
it
for
the
dolphins
and
sits
on
the
board
of
the
local
school
foundation
otherwise
for
most
of
the
parents
involved
volunteering
for
the
dolphins
is
not
at
all
altruistic
because
the
benefits
are
so
large
the
company
of
broadly
like-minded
people
is
amusing
and
could
constitute
useful
networking
as
well
as
being
great
fun
the
team
is
likewise
a
lesson
for
the
children
in
building
social
capital
for
working
parents
its
daily
training
sessions
are
a
solution
to
the
long
school-holiday
the
fact
that
less
well-educated
americans
have
struggled
to
replace
their
dwindling
methodist
churches
and
labour
unions
with
neo-tocquevillean
projects
like
the
dolphins
underlines
how
inadequate
income
is
as
a
measure
of
inequality
social
capital
is
a
huge
contributor
to
well-being
that
more
and
more
americans
are
missing
out
on
this
will
weigh
on
their
children's
prospects
too
lacking
experience
of
social
institutions
they
are
less
likely
to
participate
in
them
it
is
a
sobering
comparison
with
the
lucky
dolphins
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
such
community
activities
though
not
obviously
a
cause
of
inequality
are
much
less
of
a
solution
to
it
than
the
earlier
social
institutions
the
churches
and
unions
were
far
more
powerful
and
also
inclusive
and
evangelising
though
non-whites
were
often
excluded
the
swim
team
is
only
open
to
people
able
to
afford
the
local
property
prices
in
other
words
american
civil
society
is
not
so
much
declining
as
bifurcating
just
as
work
and
educational
opportunity
is
privilege
and
disadvantage
are
becoming
entrenched
that
suggests
it
will
be
hard
to
rebuild
social
capital
where
it
is
fading
fastest
its
demise
is
part
of
a
broader
story
of
stagnant
wages
poor
schools
and
shaky
confidence
which
in
turn
will
take
more
than
a
renewal
in
local
organising
to
arrest
yet
that
is
still
an
important
goal
and
the
vibrant
social
institutions
of
privileged
americans
should
at
least
be
easier
to
spread
around
than
their
other
advantages
because
they
draw
on
such
well-established
traditions
more
than
money
they
require
local
leadership
and
enthusiasm
qualities
as
old
as
america
and
as
the
country's
still-high
rates
of
volunteering
show
they
remain
characteristic
of
it
for
a
newcomer
to
the
tocquevillean
tradition
that
is
the
most
striking
thing
about
a
local
effort
like
the
dolphins
it
represents
a
culture
that
simply
does
not
exist
anything
like
so
vigorously
in
most
other
countries
it
is
america
for
richer
or
poorer
at
its
best
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
