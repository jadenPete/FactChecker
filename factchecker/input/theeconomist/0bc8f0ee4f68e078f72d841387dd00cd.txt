america
is
the
only
rich
country
without
a
law
on
paid
leave
for
new
parents
support
for
changing
this
is
growing
in
both
parties
the
president's
commission
on
the
status
of
women
was
unequivocal
in
its
recommendation
paid
maternity
leave
or
comparable
insurance
benefits
should
be
provided
for
women
workers
that
conclusion
was
reached
in
when
john
kennedy
was
president
but
america
still
has
no
federal
policy
in
place
to
guarantee
working
mothers
or
fathers
paid
time
off
to
care
for
their
new
babies
it
is
one
of
only
two
countries
in
the
world
along
with
papua
new
guinea
that
have
no
statutory
national
policy
of
paid
maternity
leave
the
average
member
of
the
oecd
a
club
of
mostly
rich
countries
offers
new
mothers
weeks
of
paid
leave
for
decades
paid
leave
was
dismissed
as
anti-business
and
marginalised
as
a
woman's
issue
says
ellen
bravo
who
runs
family
values
at
work
an
ngo
that
is
changing
the
race
was
the
first
time
both
presidential
candidates
publicly
lent
support
to
paid
parental
leave
and
the
issue
is
likely
to
feature
in
the
president's
most
recent
budget
included
a
proposal
for
six
weeks
of
paid
parental
leave
but
provided
no
details
on
funding
several
bills
have
been
introduced
in
congress
including
one
co-sponsored
by
kirsten
gillibrand
a
democratic
senator
who
is
running
for
president
which
would
provide
paid
leave
for
new
parents
and
caregivers
for
sick
family
members
and
another
co-sponsored
by
marco
rubio
a
republican
senator
which
focuses
exclusively
on
new
parents
neither
bill
has
passed
but
a
national
policy
will
pass
both
the
house
and
senate
in
the
next
three
to
five
years
ms
bravo
predicts
in
the
meantime
states
are
taking
action
connecticut
and
oregon
recently
became
the
seventh
and
eighth
states
to
guarantee
paid
family
leave
and
a
handful
of
others
including
colorado
minnesota
and
vermont
are
expected
to
take
up
the
issue
next
year
california
recently
extended
its
maximum
paid
family
leave
benefits
from
six
to
eight
weeks
and
its
governor
gavin
newsom
has
floated
the
idea
of
extending
parental
leave
to
six
months
to
promote
parental
bonding
with
new
children
and
to
help
families
save
on
child-care
costs
it's
the
next
gay
marriage
says
jason
sabo
of
frontera
strategy
a
lobbying
firm
in
texas
who
predicts
that
paid
leave
will
quickly
evolve
from
being
perceived
as
a
fringe
issue
to
gaining
mainstream
support
and
broader
acceptance
by
society
there
are
several
reasons
why
paid
leave
is
attracting
more
interest
from
lawmakers
first
it
is
a
popular
issue
with
people
of
all
political
persuasions
especially
younger
voters
and
women
who
think
new
parents
should
certainly
have
time
off
to
bond
with
their
babies
conservatives
concerned
about
the
health
of
families
have
fastened
on
to
it
men
who
want
to
be
more
involved
in
their
children's
lives
have
pushed
employers
to
offer
paternity
leave
second
it
has
become
more
apparent
that
existing
policies
do
not
reach
enough
american
workers
the
family
medical
leave
act
fmla
of
signed
into
law
by
bill
clinton
provides
unpaid
leave
for
a
limited
set
of
tasks
including
caring
for
a
new
baby
however
only
of
private-sector
workers
are
eligible
for
the
fmla
because
of
strict
requirements
about
firm
size
and
hours
previously
worked
nearly
half
struggle
to
afford
taking
unpaid
time
off
even
if
they
qualify
for
it
whereas
small
businesses
are
generally
loth
to
offer
paid
leave
larger
companies
have
started
to
do
so
voluntarily
especially
large
ones
that
can
afford
to
foot
the
bill
such
as
deloitte
nike
lowe's
walmart
and
many
of
silicon
valley's
technology
firms
but
only
of
private-sector
employees
nationally
have
access
to
paid
family
leave
through
their
firms
and
that
access
is
unequal
it
is
available
to
only
of
people
working
in
the
lowest
quartile
of
paid
jobs
compared
with
of
those
in
the
highest
quartile
third
there
is
mounting
evidence
from
states
that
have
already
extended
their
own
paid-leave
policies
that
the
policies
do
not
place
a
big
burden
on
companies
and
governments
relative
to
their
benefits
research
from
california
which
was
the
first
state
to
pass
a
paid
family-leave
policy
in
shows
that
most
firms
found
the
impact
either
neutral
or
positive
allowing
employees
to
take
paid
time
off
increases
the
chances
that
they
will
stay
which
is
especially
valuable
in
such
a
competitive
job
market
offering
paid
leave
also
reduces
the
likelihood
of
workers
going
into
debt
and
drawing
on
public
assistance
there
is
also
greater
understanding
of
the
health
benefits
of
paid
leave
for
babies
and
parents
fewer
babies
are
admitted
to
hospital
and
both
breast-feeding
and
vaccination
rates
increase
mothers
who
take
some
time
off
are
also
less
likely
to
suffer
from
depression
but
while
there
is
growing
support
for
offering
paid
leave
strong
disagreements
persist
even
among
advocates
of
a
federal
policy
one
concerns
whether
to
extend
leave
beyond
new
parents
to
those
who
need
to
care
for
a
sick
loved
one
parental
leave
accounts
for
only
about
of
the
m
absences
taken
each
year
under
the
fmla
caring
for
a
close
family
member
or
attending
to
one's
own
poor
health
account
for
of
cases
all
states
that
have
passed
paid-leave
laws
have
adopted
a
wider
definition
of
the
family
than
the
fmla
does
and
some
states
such
as
oregon
go
especially
far
in
extending
leave
not
just
to
family
members
but
to
close
friends
and
other
chosen
family
says
vicki
shabo
of
new
america
a
progressive
think-tank
republicans
such
as
mr
rubio
back
paid
parental
leave
more
strongly
than
paid
leave
more
broadly
defined
the
key
concern
folks
have
is
that
it's
much
harder
to
verify
people
worry
there's
more
scope
for
cheating
the
system
explains
maya
rossin-slater
of
stanford
university
though
she
doubts
that
there
is
much
cheating
in
states
with
paid
leave
the
biggest
obstacle
though
is
working
out
how
to
fund
paid
leave
the
states
that
have
embraced
their
own
policies
have
funded
them
through
payroll
taxes
on
employees
employers
or
some
split
between
the
two
with
rates
ranging
from
less
than
of
worker
wages
in
new
jersey
up
to
in
rhode
island
the
rates
are
small
enough
to
have
avoided
a
backlash
from
employers
and
workers
says
ms
shabo
of
new
america
the
bill
that
ms
gillibrand
has
introduced
in
the
senate
called
the
family
and
medical
insurance
leave
act
would
also
be
funded
by
a
new
payroll
tax
with
employers
and
employees
each
contributing
of
wages
voters
who
are
broadly
keen
on
paid
leave
may
be
less
so
if
it
comes
at
a
high
cost
to
them
around
three-quarters
of
americans
support
a
federal
paid-leave
programme
when
costs
are
not
mentioned
but
around
say
they
would
oppose
it
if
it
cost
them
a
year
in
higher
taxes
according
to
a
survey
for
the
cato
institute
a
libertarian
think-tank
another
way
to
finance
paid
leave
endorsed
by
mr
rubio
would
be
for
new
parents
to
withdraw
money
from
social
security
early
and
to
delay
retirement
but
that
is
controversial
this
route
would
disproportionately
hurt
women
who
take
leave
more
often
and
would
thus
be
forced
to
work
longer
before
retirement
it
would
also
drain
the
social
security
benefits
of
low-wage-earners
who
most
need
retirement
benefits
later
on
this
puts
advocates
for
a
national
paid-leave
policy
in
a
bind
is
it
better
to
accept
an
imperfect
solution
that
guarantees
progress
on
paid
leave
or
hold
out
in
the
hope
of
a
more
comprehensive
inclusive
and
generous
policy
later
on
advocates
would
be
wise
to
keep
momentum
going
with
a
strong
economy
and
bipartisan
interest
the
moment
is
right
for
action
better
years
late
than
never
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist

to
expect
