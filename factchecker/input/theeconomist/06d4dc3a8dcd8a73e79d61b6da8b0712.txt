at
this
stage
in
the
democratic
primary
polls
are
unreliable
but
they
can
predict
who
will
be
at
the
front
of
the
pack
with
some
accuracy
there
are
still
weeks
to
go
until
the
democratic
party
holds
its
nominating
convention
in
milwaukee
about
the
same
amount
of
time
a
rhinoceros
pregnancy
lasts
is
it
too
early
to
say
anything
meaningful
about
which
candidate
will
win
yes
it
is
at
this
point
in
the
cycle
donald
trump
had
not
even
announced
his
bid
for
the
presidency
but
although
the
most
widely
watched
information
about
the
race
public
polls
will
not
help
you
pick
a
winner
until
mid-summer
they
can
convey
useful
information
about
the
top-three
candidates
even
this
early
presidential
primaries
have
changed
greatly
over
the
past
half-century
it
was
once
relatively
easy
to
identify
a
winner
as
fewer
candidates
ran
and
elite
endorsements
could
make
or
break
a
campaign
with
ease
most
candidates
did
not
formally
announce
they
were
running
unless
they
already
knew
they
were
going
to
have
a
good
shot
at
the
nomination
the
so-called
invisible
primary
really
was
invisible
to
most
americans
contests
typically
had
just
a
handful
of
candidates
and
many
fewer
states
used
primaries
to
select
a
candidate
than
they
do
today
the
timetable
has
changed
too
william
g.
mayer
and
andrew
e.
busch
two
political
scientists
calculated
that
back
in
voters
had
selected
only
of
all
delegates
by
the
sixth
week
of
the
primary
season
by
that
point
in
just
shy
of
will
have
done
so
though
the
process
has
sped
up
it
is
still
possible
to
tune
in
too
early
election-watchers
querying
when
to
pay
attention
to
the
race
have
to
solve
three
puzzles
first
they
must
pick
a
point
when
the
main
candidates
can
be
identified
second
they
have
to
determine
when
voters
will
start
making
up
their
minds
about
which
candidates
to
support
third
they
must
factor
in
when
the
public
will
have
information
at
their
disposal
to
shape
those
intentions
the
best
single
indicator
that
offers
insight
into
all
three
questions
is
public
polling
according
to
the
economist's
analysis
of
polling
data
spanning
democratic
and
republican
presidential
primaries
from
to
polls
taken
this
far
away
from
nomination
conventions
are
more
wrong
than
right
our
statistical
model
estimates
that
just
of
primary
polls
fielded
weeks
before
a
party's
nomination
convention
put
the
eventual
winner
in
the
lead
there
is
a
caveat
though
although
polls
this
early
do
not
pick
the
winner
very
often
they
do
often
correctly
place
the
candidate
in
the
right
tier
in
polls
taken
as
far
in
advance
as
today
is
from
the
convention
the
eventual
winner
was
among
the
top
three
contenders
of
the
time
the
current
field
is
unusual
though
and
might
defy
this
pattern
there
are
a
lot
of
candidates
half
a
dozen
of
them
look
plausible
and
there
is
no
overwhelming
favourite
if
not
now
when
should
you
start
paying
attention
to
the
primaries
according
to
our
number-crunching
polls
start
picking
the
right
winner
more
than
half
of
the
time
weeks
before
the
convention
or
about
in
mid-july
of
this
year
by
that
point
most
candidates
have
announced
that
they
are
running
the
winners
and
losers
are
just
a
couple
of
spots
from
their
finishing
position
and
more
voters
have
tuned
in
until
then
the
day-to-day
and
week-to-week
fluctuations
in
the
race
are
not
as
important
as
headline
writers
and
washington
politicos
would
have
you
believe
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
