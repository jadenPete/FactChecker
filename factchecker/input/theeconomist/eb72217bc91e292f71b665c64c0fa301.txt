applying
lessons
from
war-torn
africa
to
chicago
concentrating
on
those
most
likely
to
kill
or
be
killed
may
help
to
bring
the
murder
rate
down
i
see
a
van
suspicious
as
hell
i
keep
walking
they
just
pull
up
get
to
shooting
i
was
just
trying
to
get
to
my
man's
crib

in
my
liver

they

back
damien
a
slender
man
in
sports
clothes
and
red
running
shoes
knows
dangers
lurk
in
some
neighbourhoods
in
the
basement
of
a
ymca
on
chicago's
south
side
he
tells
of
being
thrown
out
of
home
when
he
was
he
has
since
been
shot
pistol-whipped
and
imprisoned
several
friends
have
been
killed
including
two
in
a
span
of
just
eight
days
i
know
it's
time
to
do
something
different
i
just
want
to
see
my
daughter
grow
up
he
says
another
man
devon
nods
and
agrees
he
describes
living
amid
and
participating
in
frequent
gun
violence
i
been
shaking
i'm
shaking
now
he
says
a
few
days
after
a
friend
was
killed
in
december
he
also
recalls
being
present
when
a
stray
round
killed
a
young
girl
released
from
prison
not
long
before
after
serving
a
juvenile
life
term
for
murder
he
sheds
tears
and
talks
of
his
anguish
over
whether
to
seek
violent
revenge
he
also
describes
exhausting
efforts
to
evade
the
rivals
who
hunt
him
he
rises
at
am
walks
long
and
circuitous
routes
avoids
public
transport
many
targeted
killings
occur
at
bus
stops
or
remains
locked
indoors
devon
a
physically
imposing
man
with
close-cropped
hair
and
a
blue
hoodie
says
he
is
changing
i
came
too
far
i
did
too
much
you
want
to
wake
up
in
peace
but
you
going
to
sleep
with
it
a
gun
on
you
what
the
fuck
two
guns
you
went
to
bed
now
you
going
to
wake
up
devon
mentions
behaviour
today
unthinkable
for
him
a
few
years
ago
he
says
he
showed
restraint
shortly
before
another
interview
in
february
when
unknown
men
robbed
him
as
he
cashed
a
cheque
everything
went
too
fast
there's
a
gun
over
here
gun
over
here
rather
than
react
violently
he
says
he
use
a
method
called
control
alt
delete
cad
to
control
his
rage
it
saved
my
life
it
probably
saved
theirs
too
he
is
proud
of
walking
away
i'm
just
saving
lives
both
men
talk
of
growing
into
different
people
damien
having
said
it
ain't
nothing
to
do
it
after
describing
his
readiness
to
shoot
people
before
adds
i've
been
controlling
myself
lately
the
two
are
among
participants
in
an
month
m
experimental
programme
called
readi
which
tries
to
change
individuals
behaviour
in
the
most
violent
districts
of
chicago
it
is
one
response
funded
by
heartland
alliance
a
big
non-profit
group
and
philanthropists
to
a
surge
in
violence
in
when
chicago
saw
murders
since
big
hierarchical
gangs
fragmented
into
hundreds
of
tiny
cliques
of
hot-headed
and
heavily
armed
youngsters
the
city's
murder
rate
has
been
stubbornly
high
the
police
force
is
unable
to
solve
of
murders
and
of
all
shootings
readi
might
make
a
difference
it
mixes
job
training
with
months
of
intense
efforts
to
teach
habits
of
restraint
the
men
are
supposed
to
become
more
employable
and
better
able
to
control
tempers
it
is
also
led
by
a
figure
eddie
bocanegra
who
has
credibility
among
participants
having
himself
served
years
in
prison
for
a
gang
killing
unusually
the
scheme
applies
lessons
from
a
study
in
liberia
in
west
africa
after
years
of
civil
war
left
young
homeless
men
involved
in
crime
especially
in
monrovia
the
capital
researchers
there
recruited
hard-core
street
youth
picking
individuals
deeply
involved
in
crime
some
got
grants
to
start
a
business
others
a
few
weeks
of
therapy
to
change
impulsive
behaviour
and
teach
basic
skills
for
legal
ways
to
make
a
living
those
who
got
both
grants
and
therapy
turned
out
to
be
much
less
likely
to
be
involved
in
crime
a
year
later
says
chris
blattman
a
researcher
at
the
university
of
chicago
who
worked
in
liberia
he
now
helps
to
advise
the
readi
programme
which
began
in
and
ends
its
first
phase
this
year
as
in
liberia
the
programme
targets
the
hardest
cases
an
algorithm
developed
by
the
city's
crime
lab
trawled
police
data
for
individuals
arrest
history
age
address
social
networks
and
for
those
who
already
know
victims
of
violence
all
indicators
of
who
is
likeliest
to
pull
a
trigger
next
mr
bocanegra
says
of
participants
have
been
arrested
before
on
average
times
each
the
focus
makes
sense
one
study
found
of
non-fatal
shootings
and
of
fatal
ones
occur
inside
a
network
of
just
of
city
residents
readi
will
be
judged
on
whether
it
cuts
not
ends
such
violence
so
far
the
anecdotes
are
encouraging
but
at
least
five
of
its
participants
have
been
killed
including
one
man
on
april
th
mr
blattman
says
the
first
measure
of
success
will
be
whether
more
participants
survive
than
members
who
are
monitored
in
a
control
group
in
the
same
neighbourhoods
he
and
mr
bocanegra
are
cautious
but
hopeful
devon
is
already
convinced
because
of
the
robbery
that
did
not
end
in
murder
cad
worked
it
worked
i
was
happy
as
hell
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
