congress
is
trying
to
create
a
federal
privacy
law
the
fourth
attempt
in
years
turns
on
how
federal
law
will
supersede
state
laws
congress
first
tried
to
pass
a
privacy
law
in
lawmakers
succeeded
but
lobbying
from
financial
services
companies
ensured
that
it
applied
only
to
the
government
not
private
firms
impetus
to
regulate
privacy
in
the
private
sector
waxed
and
waned
over
the
next
years
building
with
the
first
tech
bubble
then
evaporating
in
the
horror
of
the
attacks
in
barack
obama
tried
again
and
failed
almost
half
a
century
after
their
first
effort
politicians
are
having
a
fourth
go
triggered
by
the
cambridge
analytica
scandal
some
have
already
offered
their
own
bills
and
work
is
now
under
way
to
knit
all
those
into
a
bipartisan
offering
ranking
republicans
and
democrats
held
two
hearings
on
capitol
hill
this
week
with
the
explicit
goal
of
informing
the
federal
privacy
bill
the
discussion
was
familiar
to
privacy
wonks
how
transparent
data
collection
should
be
what
limits
there
should
be
on
it
how
to
avoid
burdensome
regulation
but
the
environment
in
which
it
took
place
suggests
it
might
be
fourth
time
lucky
big
tech
companies
are
on
board
owing
to
a
mixture
of
self-interest
and
a
sincere
feeling
that
something
must
be
done
their
policy
teams
regularly
meet
the
congressional
staffers
who
are
drawing
up
the
legislation
a
bill
is
expected
to
be
introduced
before
the
august
recess
probably
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
what
all
sides
do
not
yet
agree
on
is
what
the
bill
should
say
the
core
controversy
is
over
whether
a
new
federal
law
should
override
what
some
states
have
already
done
the
disagreement
hinges
on
california
which
adopted
a
new
privacy
law
last
year
which
will
go
into
effect
in
and
is
broadly
aligned
with
european
regulations
republicans
and
tech
companies
want
the
federal
law
to
supersede
california's
rules
replacing
them
with
a
something
more
permissive
democrats
want
any
federal
law
to
match
california's
standard
california
is
not
the
only
state
threatened
by
pre-emption
it
would
also
kill
a
law
in
illinois
regulating
the
collection
of
biometrics
in
vermont
rules
that
regulate
the
opaque
business
of
data-brokers
would
disappear
rules
that
are
in
draft
form
in
at
least
ten
state
legislatures
would
be
wiped
away
those
who
oppose
pre-emption
see
this
as
a
step
backwards
away
from
strong
privacy
rules
those
in
favour
think
it
is
good
to
try
to
harmonise
a
complicated
patchwork
of
state
rules
including
pre-emption
in
the
federal
bill
presents
a
political
problem
regardless
of
beliefs
about
the
correct
level
of
privacy
regulation
any
federal
law
must
pass
through
a
house
presided
over
by
nancy
pelosi
from
california's
th
district
it
is
hard
to
imagine
the
house
which
contains
a
powerful
bloc
of
californian
democrats
undermining
the
speaker's
state
the
regulations
are
not
just
a
domestic
concern
european
courts
both
national
and
supranational
are
examining
whether
american
regulation
measures
up
to
that
in
europe
if
it
does
not
that
would
mean
that
the
personal
data
of
europeans
cannot
flow
to
america
for
processing
hurting
american
internet
companies
a
set
of
regulations
which
keeps
europe
happy
is
therefore
in
the
interests
of
both
politicians
and
tech
companies
it
seems
likely
that
some
common
ground
exists
there
is
broad
agreement
that
a
level
regulatory
playing
field
would
be
good
for
companies
and
citizens
while
the
need
to
keep
the
american
data-processing
market
open
to
europe
is
obvious
even
so
disagreements
about
just
how
sharp
to
make
america's
new
privacy
rules
may
yet
derail
their
creation
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
