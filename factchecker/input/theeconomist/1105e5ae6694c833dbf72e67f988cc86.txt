should
america
rule
out
first
use
of
nuclear
weapons
elizabeth
warren
thinks
so
america's
allies
do
not
president
barack
obama
promised
that
he
would
reduce
the
role
that
nuclear
weapons
played
in
america's
national
security
strategy
his
successor
has
done
the
opposite
in
a
review
of
nuclear
policy
published
in
february
donald
trump
seemed
to
expand
the
circumstances
in
which
america
might
use
nuclear
weapons
first
to
include
cyber-attacks
on
the
networks
that
transmit
presidential
orders
to
silos
submarines
and
bombers
he
also
ordered
the
manufacture
of
new
low-yield
warheads
these
are
equivalent
to
about
half
a
hiroshima
which
critics
fear
are
more
likely
to
be
used
and
he
has
issued
hair-raising
threats
against
north
korea
alarming
those
who
worry
about
his
impulsiveness
all
this
is
fuelling
a
debate
about
nuclear
risks
elizabeth
warren
a
democratic
presidential
contender
wants
to
start
with
american
nuclear
doctrine
every
president
since
harry
truman
has
reserved
the
right
to
use
nuclear
weapons
in
a
conflict
even
if
an
enemy
has
not
unleashed
them
first
in
january
ms
warren
introduced
a
senate
bill
that
would
mandate
a
policy
of
what
wonks
call
no
first
use
nfu
such
pledges
are
common
china
and
india
committed
themselves
to
versions
of
nfu
decades
ago
as
did
the
soviet
union
but
in
america
it
would
reverse
over
seven
decades
of
nuclear
thinking
proponents
of
nfu
argue
that
launching
nuclear
weapons
first
in
a
conflict
is
neither
necessary
nor
wise
it
is
not
necessary
because
america's
regular
armed
forces
are
strong
enough
to
defeat
enemies
without
recourse
to
weapons
of
mass
destruction
it
is
not
wise
because
an
adversary
that
fears
an
american
bolt
from
the
blue
is
more
likely
to
put
its
own
arsenal
on
hair-trigger
alert
increasing
the
risk
of
unauthorised
or
accidental
launch
an
adversary
might
also
be
tempted
to
pre-empt
america
by
going
even
faster
a
dangerous
dynamic
that
thomas
schelling
an
economist
and
nuclear
theorist
called
the
reciprocal
fear
of
surprise
attack
that
is
all
well
and
good
say
critics
of
nfu
but
america
is
in
a
different
position
from
china
and
india
it
not
only
defends
itself
but
also
extends
a
protective
nuclear
umbrella
over
allies
around
the
world
if
north
korea
were
to
invade
south
korea
with
its
ample
army
it
must
reckon
with
the
possibility
of
a
nuclear
response
from
america
the
south
korean
government
would
like
to
keep
it
that
way
estonia
and
taiwan
would
like
russia
and
china
respectively
to
face
similar
uncertainty
thus
when
mr
obama
toyed
with
the
idea
of
pledging
nfu
during
his
administration
britain
japan
france
and
south
korea
all
american
allies
facing
more
populous
foes
lobbied
successfully
against
such
a
move
nfu-sceptics
also
point
to
the
increasing
potency
of
non-nuclear
weapons
like
america
china
and
russia
are
both
developing
hypersonic
missiles
capable
of
crossing
oceans
at
over
five
times
the
speed
of
sound
some
might
destroy
targets
with
nothing
more
than
their
kinetic
energy
no
need
for
nuclear
tips
chemical
and
biological
weapons
could
also
wreak
havoc
without
splitting
atoms
that
would
put
an
nfu-bound
america
in
an
invidious
position
if
such
non-nuclear
missiles
were
falling
on
washington
should
a
nuclear
response
be
off
the
table
and
even
if
it
was
declared
to
be
so
would
adversaries
believe
it
after
all
pakistan
is
scornful
of
india's
own
nfu
pledge
just
as
america
is
sceptical
of
china's
talk
is
cheap
trust
is
in
short
supply
and
the
stakes
could
not
be
higher
whereas
ms
warren's
proposal
would
outlaw
first
use
under
any
circumstances
others
merely
wish
to
place
checks
on
this
untrammelled
presidential
launch
authority
america's
nuclear
chain
of
command
was
designed
to
concentrate
decision-making
in
the
white
house
and
to
keep
it
away
from
generals
james
mattis
mr
trump's
defence
secretary
until
last
year
reassured
outsiders
that
he
would
serve
as
a
check
telling
strategic
command
not
to
put
on
a
pot
of
coffee
without
letting
him
know
according
to
the
washington
post
but
he
had
no
foolproof
means
to
guarantee
he
could
do
this
the
weight
of
the
open
evidence
suggests
that
the
secretary
of
defence
is
not
just
unnecessary
but
not
even
in
the
nuclear
chain
of
command
says
alex
wellerstein
an
expert
on
nuclear
history
at
the
stevens
institute
of
technology
william
perry
a
former
defence
secretary
agrees
the
president
is
free
to
instruct
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
the
top
military
officer
as
he
wishes
we
built
a
system
that
depends
on
having
a
rational
actor
in
the
white
house
says
alexandra
bell
a
former
state
department
official
now
at
the
centre
for
arms
control
and
non-proliferation
we
now
know
the
system
is
flawed
in
january
congressman
ted
lieu
and
senator
ed
markey
both
democrats
reintroduced
a
bill
originally
proposed
in
that
would
force
the
president
to
seek
a
congressional
declaration
of
war
last
done
in
with
express
approval
for
nuclear
first
use
nancy
pelosi
the
democratic
leader
of
the
house
of
representatives
endorsed
the
idea
in
there
are
also
wider
efforts
to
prune
the
arsenal
adam
smith
the
chairman
of
the
house
armed
services
committee
and
co-sponsor
of
ms
warren's
nfu
bill
has
sought
to
cut
funding
for
mr
trump's
mini-nuke
and
to
limit
its
deployment
on
submarines
to
the
pentagon's
horror
he
has
also
suggested
scrapping
america's
silo-based
missiles
leaving
the
job
to
submarines
and
bombers
politicians
should
not
expect
clear
guidance
from
voters
a
survey
in
found
that
agreed
with
ms
warren
that
the
us
should
only
use
nuclear
weapons
in
response
to
a
nuclear
attack
by
another
nation
yet
it
turns
out
that
americans
also
quite
like
fire
and
fury
a
paper
by
scott
sagan
of
stanford
university
and
benjamin
valentino
of
dartmouth
college
published
in
found
that
a
clear
majority
approved
of
using
nuclear
weapons
first
if
doing
so
would
save
the
lives
of
american
soldiers
even
if
it
killed
m
iranian
civilians
the
conventional
wisdom
around
nuclear
weapons
remains
strongly
embedded
says
jon
wolfsthal
director
of
the
nuclear
crisis
group
and
a
former
official
in
mr
obama's
administration
i
am
not
sure
there
will
be
changes
but
big
changes
are
being
discussed
more
openly
now
than
in
a
long
time
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
