donald
trump
replaces
john
bolton
with
a
hostage
negotiator
robert
o'brien
has
similar
views
to
his
predecessor
but
a
less
combative
style
two
months
before
the
election
robert
o'brien
a
lawyer
from
los
angeles
opined
on
russian
interference
to
a
radio
talk-show
host
it's
clear
that
vladimir
putin
just
doesn't
like
hillary
clinton
and
is
going
to
do
what
he
can
to
help
donald
trump
after
the
election
mr
o'brien
who
had
advised
ted
cruz
scott
walker
and
mitt
romney
in
their
presidential
runs
changed
his
tune
praising
mr
trump
before
he
even
took
office
for
getting
nato
allies
to
boost
their
defence
spending
last
year
mr
trump
named
mr
o'brien
an
envoy
for
hostage
affairs
mr
o'brien
according
to
mr
trump
called
the
president
the
greatest
hostage
negotiator
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
flattery
works
on
september
th
mr
o'brien
became
mr
trump's
fourth
national
security
adviser
succeeding
john
bolton
who
was
fired
a
week
earlier
unlike
mr
bolton
mr
o'brien
is
relatively
unknown
in
foreign-policy
circles
jim
talent
a
former
republican
senator
who
worked
with
him
on
mr
romney's
campaign
says
mr
o'brien
absorbs
enormous
amounts
of
information
quickly
and
will
be
an
honest
broker
at
ensuring
options
for
the
president
the
opposite
model
to
mr
bolton
mr
o'brien
worked
under
mr
bolton
at
the
un
then
spent
four
years
at
the
state
department
spanning
the
administrations
of
george
w.
bush
and
barack
obama
working
on
the
justice
system
in
afghanistan
mr
trump
considered
him
for
secretary
of
the
navy
a
job
he
would
probably
have
held
had
mr
romney
won
in
while
america
slept
restoring
american
leadership
to
a
world
in
crisis
published
in
mr
o'brien
comes
off
as
a
garden-variety
hawk
he
criticises
the
obama
administration's
pusillanimity
condemns
the
iranian
nuclear
agreement
as
the
worst
diplomatic
deal
since
munich
and
warns
that
mr
obama
is
decimating
america's
unparalleled
armed
forces
he
urges
america
to
support
egypt's
despot
general
abdel
fattah
al-sisi
and
wants
to
wants
to
serve
notice
upon
north
korea
that
it
is
within
reach
of
american
naval
air
power
it
is
time
he
says
to
return
to
a
policy
of
peace
through
strength
such
views
resemble
mr
bolton's
though
mr
o'brien
unlike
his
predecessor
has
a
reputation
for
congeniality
that
may
help
restore
comity
and
morale
at
the
national
security
council
but
legal
work
and
diplomatic
dabbling
may
not
have
given
him
sufficient
expertise
to
guide
a
mercurial
president's
foreign
policy
a
former
senior
official
who
worked
with
mr
o'brien
describes
him
as
a
very
smart
very
nice
and
very
capable
lawyer
from
los
angeles
with
a
long-standing
interest
in
national
security
matters
but
there's
nothing
in
his
biography
that
suggests
he
has
the
experience
or
bandwidth
to
take
on
this
job
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
