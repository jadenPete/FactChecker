the

unpopular
about
three-quarters
of

surveyed

said
it
is
important
that
the

provides
funding
for

at
the
moment
most
forms
of
preventive
birth
control
must
be
prescribed
by
a

which

harder
but
a
consortium
of
medical
groups
including
the
american
college

obstetricians
and
gynecologists
has
long
endorsed
the
idea
of
making

consistently
shown
that

birth-control
pills
moving
birth
control
over

is
one
of
the
few
issues
where
democrats
and
republicans
agree
at

in
principle
but
the
parties
different
stances
on
crucial
details
such
as
age
limits
and
insurance
coverage
have
so
far
frozen
any
progress
moving
some
forms
of

control
over
the
counter
is
not
the
only
way
to
increase
access

of

they

that
