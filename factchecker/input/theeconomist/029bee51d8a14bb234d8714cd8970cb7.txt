republicans
and
democrats
are
taking
early
education
more
seriously
alabama
and
west
virginia
are
among
the
pioneers
from
hot
dogs
to
automobiles
to
diesel
fuel
americans
have
been
touched
by
plenty
of
german
inventions
kindergarten
children-garden
is
one
of
them
the
programme
for
educating
youngsters
through
playing
and
social
interaction
meant
as
a
transition
from
home
to
formal
schooling
was
first
brought
to
america
in
the
s
and
quickly
spread
kindergarten
has
flourished
becoming
so
entrenched
that
it
is
part
of
the
formal
education
system's
name
k
through
yet
the
garden
of
even
younger
americans
including
preschoolers
has
too
often
gone
uncultivated
the
share
of
three-
and
four-year-olds
enrolled
in
pre-school
has
not
changed
much
in
two
decades
while
the
average
country
in
the
oecd
a
club
of
rich
nations
enrolls
of
its
three-
and
four-year-old
children
in
school
america
enrolls
just
lagging
behind
chile
and
mexico
this
is
true
despite
abundant
evidence
of
the
benefits
of
early
education
especially
for
disadvantaged
children
high-quality
pre-school
programmes
can
have
lasting
benefits
including
improving
the
odds
of
graduating
from
school
earning
more
and
staying
away
from
drugs
and
out
of
prison
for
parents
there
are
gains
too
when
their
children
are
in
day
care
they
can
work
in
the
shadows
of
a
government
shutdown
and
chaotic
governance
generally
one
achievement
of
president
donald
trump's
administration
has
gone
unnoticed
in
congress
approved
more
than
bn
in
child
care
and
development
block
grants
which
subsidise
child
care
for
low-income
families
nearly
doubling
available
funding
and
indicating
a
rare
example
of
bipartisan
collaboration
head
start
a
federal
programme
that
educates
poor
children
before
they
enter
kindergarten
has
also
received
more
funding
at
federal
level
pre-school
is
still
perceived
as
more
of
a
democratic
issue
while
republicans
are
more
likely
to
support
subsidised
child
care
and
home
visits
says
libby
doggett
who
served
as
the
deputy
assistant
secretary
for
early
learning
at
the
department
of
education
under
barack
obama
meanwhile
in
the
various
states
pre-k
is
being
championed
by
both
political
parties
the
fact
that
cities
and
states
have
the
ability
to
implement
their
own
programmes
rather
than
wait
for
the
national
government
to
act
is
an
advantage
high
schools
spread
in
america
between
and
mainly
because
cities
promoted
and
paid
for
them
says
steven
barnett
of
the
national
institute
for
early
education
research
at
rutgers
university
which
compiles
an
annual
report
card
on
state
pre-school
programmes
in
the
gubernatorial
elections
held
last
november
winning
candidates
either
publicly
commented
on
the
importance
of
early
childhood
education
or
supported
such
programmes
this
includes
not
only
the
usual
suspects
democratic
governors
in
states
like
illinois
new
jersey
and
michigan
but
also
republicans
in
like-minded
states
including
arkansas
georgia
and
idaho
for
example
mike
dewine
the
republican
governor
of
ohio
who
assumed
office
this
month
promised
expanded
access
to
pre-school
during
his
campaign
in
a
politically
symbolic
move
his
first
staffing
announcement
was
to
choose
a
director
of
children's
initiatives
california's
new
governor
gavin
newsom
a
democrat
has
the
biggest
and
most
closely
watched
plans
of
any
state
he
recently
announced
bn
in
new
funding
directed
at
the
spectrum
of
young
children's
needs
from
home
visits
to
affordable
child
care
to
expanded
pre-k
whereas
many
states
have
invested
in
early
childhood
no
state
has
put
together
the
whole
continuum
into
a
birth-to-five
system
as
mr
newsom
hopes
to
do
says
ms
doggett
central
to
his
plan
is
providing
six
months
of
paid
leave
for
new
parents
so
that
they
can
bond
with
and
care
for
their
infants
this
is
not
radical
by
european
standards
but
it
is
by
american
ones
since
california
is
home
to
around
one
in
eight
american
children
aged
five
and
under
and
also
has
the
nation's
highest
poverty
rate
after
accounting
for
the
cost
of
living
what
happens
there
matters
a
great
deal
but
smaller
states
are
also
making
strides
in
west
virginia
passed
legislation
that
required
the
state
to
offer
pre-k
to
all
four-year-olds
by
alabama
is
another
bright
spot
in
alabama's
legislature
bolstered
pre-k
funding
by
around
m
the
state's
largest-ever
increase
kay
ivey
the
republican
governor
has
been
an
outspoken
advocate
delegations
from
other
states
have
travelled
there
to
study
its
success
one
lesson
to
draw
is
the
importance
of
companies
as
allies
businesses
in
alabama
have
been
prominent
supporters
of
increasing
funding
for
early
education
some
cities
are
also
making
strides
texas
does
not
have
a
highly
regarded
state
pre-school
programme
but
san
antonio
does
it
raised
the
local
sales
tax
from
to
to
invest
in
full-day
pre-school
under
its
former
mayor
juli
n
castro
having
rolled
out
pre-school
for
four-year-olds
new
york
city
is
now
expanding
access
to
three-year-olds
with
the
support
of
mayor
bill
deblasio
such
widespread
support
tends
to
mask
two
trade-offs
inherent
in
making
early-years
education
more
widely
available
first
researchers
believe
that
it
is
better
to
back
smaller
higher-quality
programmes
it's
always
easier
for
a
state
to
go
from
better
to
bigger
than
bigger
to
better
says
david
kirp
author
of
the
sandbox
investment
a
book
about
pre-school
and
politics
for
impatient
politicians
it
is
tempting
to
go
for
scale
first
second
early-years
teachers
are
often
paid
little
which
can
hurt
the
quality
of
the
programmes
on
offer
earnings
are
so
paltry
that
of
child-care
workers
in
california
qualify
for
some
form
of
public
assistance
such
as
food
stamps
says
deborah
stipek
of
stanford
university
this
contributes
to
extremely
high
turnover
around
a
quarter
of
child-care
workers
and
pre-school
teachers
leave
each
year
reckons
scott
moore
of
kidango
the
bay
area's
largest
preschool
provider
who
says
what
early
educators
make
is
unconscionable
but
making
programmes
available
to
everyone
makes
them
more
expensive
leaving
little
to
pay
teachers
more
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is

up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown

no
sign
of
