what
explains
donald
trump's
war
on
late-term
abortions
attacks
on
the
rare
but
controversial
procedures
are
designed
to
please
more
than
evangelicals
while
leroy
carhart
a
doctor
who
specialises
in
late-term
abortions
was
finishing
his
most
recent
termination
the
manager
of
his
clinic
in
bethesda
maryland
outlined
the
procedure
abortions
in
the
second
half
of
pregnancy
take
between
two
and
four
days
said
christine
spiegoski
a
nurse
wearing
a
t-shirt
that
read
don't
like
abortion
prevent
pregnancy
by
f
king
yourself
first
the
doctor
injects
potassium
chloride
or
digoxin
into
the
fetus's
heart
killing
it
within
minutes
if
he
is
unable
to
reach
the
heart
and
instead
pumps
the
drug
into
the
amniotic
sac
death
can
take
up
to
hours
dr
carhart
euthanises
the
fetus
at
the
beginning
of
the
procedure
because
its
tissue
and
skull
then
soften
and
contract
easing
removal
at
weeks
a
fetus
weighs
around
a
pound
and
a
half
and
is
over
a
foot
long
some
of
those
dr
carhart
aborts
are
older
over
the
next
two
or
three
days
medical
staff
at
the
clinic
one
of
only
three
in
america
to
provide
third-trimester
abortions
insert
small
sticks
into
the
woman's
cervix
to
stretch
it
open
then
the
woman
is
induced
and
the
fetus
delivered
the
goal
says
ms
spiegoski
is
a
delivery
as
much
like
regular
labour
as
possible
the
procedure
she
describes
is
quite
different
from
president
donald
trump's
oft-repeated
claim
that
late-term
abortions
involve
babies
being
ripped
from
their
mother's
womb
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
why
many
people
including
those
broadly
in
favour
of
abortion
choice
find
it
problematic
this
is
also
why
mr
trump
has
seized
upon
late-term
abortion
the
most
controversial
dimension
of
an
issue
that
has
inflamed
american
politics
for
almost
half
a
century
as
a
campaign
issue
data
on
abortion
late
in
pregnancy
in
america
are
patchy
not
all
states
are
required
to
report
abortion
statistics
to
the
centres
for
disease
control
cdc
a
federal
agency
and
the
states
that
do
provide
the
gestational
ages
of
aborted
fetuses
use
ranges
that
do
not
reveal
how
many
terminations
take
place
in
the
third
trimester
still
the
data
suggest
late
abortions
are
extremely
rare
in
of
abortions
took
place
after
weeks
but
they
carry
huge
political
weight
as
mr
trump
who
once
described
himself
as
very
pro-choice
is
keenly
aware
the
two
sides
in
america's
abortion
war
have
driven
each
other
to
new
extremes
this
year
a
flood
of
early-abortion
laws
in
conservative
states
some
tantamount
to
total
bans
have
prompted
other
socially
liberal
states
to
make
it
easier
to
have
an
abortion
at
the
other
end
of
pregnancy
meanwhile
the
trump
administration
has
set
new
rules
for
title
x
a
federal
family-planning
grant
programme
dating
back
to
the
nixon
administration
organisations
receiving
title-x
funding
are
no
longer
allowed
to
provide
abortions
or
refer
patients
to
doctors
for
them
on
august
th
planned
parenthood
responded
by
announcing
it
would
withdraw
from
the
programme
forgoing
some
m
in
funding
to
avoid
the
new
rules
mr
trump's
declaration
of
war
on
late
abortions
a
common
theme
at
his
rallies
is
not
only
designed
to
please
the
evangelicals
who
helped
elect
him
in
gallup
polling
suggests
that
whereas
a
majority
of
americans
think
abortion
should
generally
be
legal
in
the
first
trimester
only
think
it
should
in
the
third
dr
carhart
says
that
people
would
change
their
minds
sharpish
if
they
or
someone
they
loved
needed
a
late
abortion
he
vowed
a
decade
ago
to
continue
the
work
of
george
tiller
an
abortion
doctor
in
kansas
shot
dead
by
an
anti-abortion
zealot
in
dr
carhart
says
he
is
motivated
by
injustice
women
he
says
tend
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
an
unwanted
pregnancy
men
can
just
walk
away
if
they
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
it
he
says
it
should
be
both
of
their
responsibilities
if
a
woman
feels
she
cannot
she
shouldn't
be
punished
to
go
through
that
try
telling
that
to
those
on
the
debate's
opposite
side
in
the
first
seven
months
of
at
least
states
passed
or
introduced
early
abortion
bans
flouting
roe
v
wade
the
supreme
court
ruling
that
in
declared
abortion
a
constitutional
right
they
were
emboldened
to
do
so
by
mr
trump's
appointment
of
justice
brett
kavanaugh
which
gave
america's
highest
court
a
solidly
conservative
majority
they
hope
that
one
such
law
will
make
it
to
the
supreme
court
and
help
overturn
roe
socially
liberal
states
have
pushed
back
this
year
illinois
maine
new
york
rhode
island
and
vermont
have
passed
laws
loosening
restrictions
on
abortion
later
in
pregnancy
codifying
protections
for
abortion
rights
or
allowing
medical
workers
other
than
doctors
to
perform
them
these
measures
are
in
part
designed
to
ensure
uninterrupted
abortion
services
if
anti-abortionists
efforts
to
overturn
roeprove
successful
but
they
are
also
like
the
legislation
that
sparked
them
political
we
wanted
to
send
a
message
and
make
it
explicit
says
ann
pugh
a
democratic
congresswoman
in
vermont
who
co-sponsored
the
bill
there
that
the
very
private
personal
matter
of
abortion
should
be
decided
by
a
woman
and
a
medical
practitioner
vermont
is
one
of
seven
states
that
have
no
laws
governing
when
or
for
what
reason
a
woman
may
have
an
abortion
why
did
the
two
sides
become
so
polarised
the
main
reason
is
the
way
abortion
was
legalised
in
many
countries
abortion
laws
were
voted
for
by
elected
politicians
or
in
referendums
in
america
a
seven-to-two
majority
of
justices
declared
abortion
a
constitutional
right
anti-abortionists
question
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
that
produced
that
ruling
and
are
furious
their
voices
were
not
heard
abortion
advocates
remain
fired
up
by
the
knowledge
that
roe
could
yet
be
overturned
had
america's
abortion
laws
been
fought
over
in
congress
they
would
probably
have
been
more
restrictive
instead
they
are
among
the
most
liberal
in
the
world
another
reason
why
abortion
is
fertile
ground
for
mr
trump
of
countries
that
allow
abortion
on
demand
america
is
one
of
only
seven
that
allow
it
after
weeks
of
pregnancy
supreme
court
rulings
allow
it
until
the
fetus
is
viable
around
weeks
thereafter
according
to
another
ruling
handed
down
on
the
same
day
as
roe
abortions
are
allowed
if
the
fetus
has
an
anomaly
or
the
mother's
life
or
health
is
at
risk
doe
v
bolton
defines
health
in
capacious
terms
to
encompass
many
aspects
of
well-being
from
the
economic
to
the
familial
research
suggests
a
minority
of
abortions
later
in
pregnancy
are
performed
because
the
fetus
has
an
anomaly
or
the
woman's
life
is
endangered
so
most
come
down
to
the
health
exception
for
his
part
dr
carhart
says
that
a
woman
requesting
an
abortion
has
to
be
a
fairly
good
storyteller
she
has
to
convince
me
that
this
really
is
a
problem
the
fact
that
she
wants
to
get
into
a
size
eight
bathing
suit
next
week
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
for
that
he
will
always
refuse
to
perform
an
abortion
if
the
woman
is
not
certain
i'd
rather
do
an
abortion
at
weeks
than
have
her
come
in
at
eight
weeks
and
have
the
abortion
and
all
of
a
sudden
realise
i
wanted
to
have
that
baby
he
says
america's
comparatively
liberal
laws
do
not
mean
it
is
easy
to
get
an
abortion
since
lawmakers
have
chipped
away
at
roe
by
introducing
hundreds
of
state-level
regulations
many
of
them
seem
trivial
prescribing
say
the
precise
width
of
clinic
corridors
but
their
cumulative
effect
has
been
devastating
at
least
seven
states
have
only
one
abortion
clinic
left
the
result
of
that
may
be
more
late
abortions
data
are
limited
but
research
by
daniel
grossman
a
professor
of
gynaecology
and
reproductive
sciences
at
the
university
of
california
san
francisco
found
that
abortion
restrictions
introduced
in
texas
in
led
to
a
increase
in
second-trimester
abortions
the
following
year
america's
abortion
war
has
curtailed
access
to
abortion
in
other
ways
too
since
the
hyde
amendment
has
forbidden
the
use
of
federal
funds
for
abortion
some
women
may
have
to
delay
abortions
while
they
raise
cash
to
pay
for
it
dr
carhart
meanwhile
says
he
has
performed
abortions
late
in
pregnancy
because
pro-life
doctors
have
chosen
not
to
tell
their
patients
the
fetus
they
are
carrying
has
an
anomaly
and
then
a
few
weeks
before
the
due
date
warn
them
about
the
condition
he
says
that
women
often
ask
for
tips
on
how
to
disguise
their
abortions
from
their
doctors
for
fear
they
refuse
to
see
them
again
i
say
to
them
why
the
hell
do
you
want
to
see
that
doctor
anyway
he
advises
those
women
to
find
a
doctor
who
shares
their
beliefs
even
the
medical
profession
is
polarised
the
only
thing
that
could
end
america's
destructive
abortion
war
is
a
political
consensus
that
unfortunately
is
unimaginable
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
