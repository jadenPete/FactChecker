donald
trump
v
congress
when
it
comes
to
domestic
policy
the
president
is
less
powerful
than
he
seems
in
william
barr
then
a
white
house
lawyer
wrote
a
memorandum
warning
the
president
to
be
mindful
of
attempts
by
congress
to
encroach
on
his
authority
thirty
years
on
mr
barr
who
will
shortly
become
america's
attorney-general
has
had
to
defend
himself
in
his
senate
confirmation
hearings
against
the
charge
which
stems
partly
from
the
memo
that
he
holds
an
alarmingly
expansionist
theory
of
the
presidency
meanwhile
the
actual
president
cannot
extract
funds
from
congress
to
build
a
wall
along
the
southern
border
the
president's
main
set-piece
the
state
of
the
union
may
be
postponed
on
the
suggestion
of
nancy
pelosi
the
house
speaker
who
reminded
the
white
house
that
the
speech
is
given
at
the
invitation
of
her
office
and
that
perhaps
a
written
version
would
be
fine
this
time
the
conflict
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
that
has
given
america
its
longest-ever
shutdown
is
inherent
to
presidential
systems
juan
linz
a
sociologist
and
political
scientist
at
yale
who
died
in
argued
that
though
america's
constitution
has
been
much-imitated
it
only
seemed
to
work
in
one
place
everywhere
beyond
america
making
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
coequal
eventually
resulted
in
stalemate
in
latin
america
linz
observed
the
deadlock
was
often
broken
by
the
army
taking
power
the
only
presidential
democracy
with
a
long
history
of
constitutional
continuity
is
the
united
states
he
concluded
in
since
then
america's
government
has
suffered
three
prolonged
shutdowns
and
is
therefore
looking
a
bit
less
exceptional
than
it
once
did
when
the
two
political
parties
were
a
jumbled
collection
of
interest
groups
conflict
was
easier
to
manage
ronald
reagan
could
usually
find
enough
like-minded
democrats
to
work
with
since
then
each
party
has
become
more
ideologically
uniform
with
little
overlap
between
them
the
current
president
cannot
find
a
single
member
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
who
thinks
that
giving
him
bn
for
his
wall
so
the
shutdown
can
end
is
a
reasonable
deal
the
dominant
view
of
the
presidency
has
long
been
that
in
the
conflict
with
the
legislature
there
is
only
one
winner
arthur
schlesinger
argued
in
the
imperial
presidency
that
america
had
already
passed
the
point
of
no
return
in
the
s
the
accretion
of
presidential
power
could
not
be
undone
nor
the
office
returned
to
something
resembling
what
the
founders
intended
bruce
ackerman
writing
in
echoed
this
in
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
american
republic
neomi
rao
whom
president
donald
trump
has
nominated
to
be
a
judge
on
the
dc
circuit
published
a
paper
in
on
administrative
collusion
by
which
she
meant
the
spineless
tendency
of
lawmakers
to
give
away
powers
to
the
executive
yet
the
shutdown
is
a
reminder
of
how
powerful
congress
remains
in
some
ways
the
presidency
is
less
powerful
domestically
than
it
was
years
ago
the
white
house
has
built
up
its
own
legal
staff
suborning
the
justice
department
and
pushing
the
limits
of
presidential
authority
wherever
possible
judged
by
spending
though
the
executive
branch
is
actually
less
imperial
than
under
eisenhower
or
kennedy
the
part
of
the
budget
that
the
executive
actually
spends
non-defence
discretionary
spending
accounts
for
a
lower
share
of
gdp
now
than
in
the
s
congressional
deadlock
which
has
been
a
feature
of
government
since
the
mid-
s
empowers
the
president
in
one
way
inviting
him
to
attempt
rule
by
decree
it
has
also
weakened
the
whole
system
that
the
president
sits
on
top
of
the
concern
that
an
overmighty
potus
is
a
threat
to
the
republic
is
a
staple
of
american
politics
it
is
often
accompanied
by
a
side-order
of
hypocrisy
thomas
jefferson
insinuated
that
the
first
and
second
presidents
harboured
monarchical
ambitions
and
then
when
he
held
the
office
himself
concluded
a
deal
doubling
the
territory
of
the
republic
without
first
asking
congress
conservatives
have
tended
to
put
up
most
resistance
to
presidential
overreach
but
find
their
party
is
now
led
by
a
president
who
has
closed
down
a
quarter
of
the
federal
government
rather
than
bow
to
congress
and
wants
to
make
extensive
use
of
eminent
domain
to
build
his
wall
progressives
cheered
the
expansion
of
presidential
power
in
the
th
century
up
to
the
vietnam
war
and
watergate
since
then
they
have
worried
more
about
circumscribing
the
powers
of
the
white
house
before
he
published
the
imperial
presidency
schlesinger
held
a
conventionally
progressive
view
of
the
presidency
which
during
his
lifetime
had
vanquished
the
depression
the
nazis
and
jim
crow
when
nixon
left
the
white
house
democrats
in
congress
then
set
about
codifying
what
presidents
can
and
cannot
do
to
prevent
future
abuses
the
first
bill
introduced
by
the
new
democratic
majority
in
the
house
is
designed
to
accomplish
a
similar
cleanup
for
the
post-trump
era
that
would
be
a
sensible
prophylactic
but
it
is
also
worth
remembering
that
after
democrats
lost
their
majority
in
the
house
in
barack
obama
spent
the
remaining
six
years
of
his
presidency
issuing
executive
orders
most
of
which
were
then
undone
by
his
successor
brendan
nyhan
a
political
scientist
at
the
university
of
michigan
developed
what
he
called
the
green
lantern
theory
of
the
presidency
named
after
a
dc
comics
character
mr
nyhan
described
this
as
the
belief
that
the
president
can
achieve
any
political
or
policy
objective
if
only
he
tries
hard
enough
or
uses
the
right
tactic
progressives
who
lamented
the
limitations
of
mr
obama's
domestic
power
forgot
all
about
this
when
mr
trump
took
office
and
assumed
he
could
govern
by
force
of
will
he
cannot
and
so
the
shutdown
goes
on
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
