was
an
investigation
centred
on
william

an
enterprising
college
counsellor
who
earned
m
from

of
powerful
people
by
fraudulently
securing
spots
for
their
children
at
highly
selective
universities
like
stanford

the
lurid

have
provoked
embarrassment
for

and
schadenfreude
for
the
public
there
is
also
an
entirely
legal
way
to
corrupt
the
elite
admissions
system
which
for
some
reason
generates
less
outrage
mr
singer
grasped
this
dynamic
there
is
a
front
door
which
means
you
get
in
on
your
own
and
a
back
door
secured
by
multimillion-dollar
donations
to

he
explained
in
a
recorded
call
to
a
client
what
mr

did
for
buyers
he
claimed
is
create
a
side
door
by
bribing
university
officials
and
faking
test
scores
that
would
achieve
the
same
result
at
one-tenth

the
prosecutors
who
flipped
mr

enumerate
several
other
jaw-dropping
tales
backed
up
with
wiretaps
of
the
various
notables
admitting
the
finer
details
of
the
schemes
rich
children
are
already
unfairly
advantaged
in
the
game
of
elite
university
admissions
they
start
out
with
stabler

preferences
positive
discrimination
for
relatives
of

that
disproportionately
benefit
the
already

such
universities
also
have
lax
standards
for
recruited

which
helps
rich
children
opportunities

do
not
abound
in

ghetto
funding
a
new
building
just
as
a
mediocre
child
applies
to
college
in
the
hope
of
boosting
their
admission
chances
remains
perfectly
legal
so
long
as
there
is
no
established
quid
pro

the
strategy
seems
common
and
successful
emails
recently
revealed
by
a
lawsuit
show
one

simply
thrilled
about
admissions
decisions
because
one
unnamed
person
had
