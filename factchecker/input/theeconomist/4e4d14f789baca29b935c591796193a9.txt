david
lewis
an
architect
of
the
plan
said
the
electoral
map
was
designed
to
gain
partisan
advantage
the
statewide
vote
has
been
nearly
tied
in
recent
elections
but
the
republican
party's
cartographic
acumen
splitting
some
democratic
constituencies
and
stuffing
others
into
as
few
districts
as
possible
helped
to
win
the
party
ten
of
the
state's
congressional
seats
see

mr
lewis
lamented
only
that
it
wasn't
possible
to
draw
a
map
with
republicans
and
two
democrats
on
march
th
the
supreme
court
scrutinised
north
carolina's
map
and
another
brazen
gerrymander
that
turned

republican

democrats

of

congressional
seats
from
six
to
seven
no
justices
spoke
up
in
favour
of
politicians
warping
district
lines
to
entrench
their
own
power
justice
brett
kavanaugh
for
one
said
the
practice
is
a
real
problem
for
our
democracy
but
it
was
uncertain
after
more
than
two
hours
of
oral
arguments
whether
a
majority
of
the
justices
will
decide
that
even
ghastly
gerrymanders
violate
america's
constitution
in
the
court
also
heard
a
pair
of
partisan
redistricting
cases
an
earlier
iteration
of
the
same
matter
from
maryland
and
a
challenge
from
wisconsin
reformers
had
hoped
justice
anthony
kennedy
might
join
the
court's
liberal
bloc
to
rein
in
gerrymandering
but
both
cases
ended
in
a
procedural
fizzle
this
time
round
neither
rucho
v
common
cause
the
north
carolina
case
nor
lamone
v
benisek
out
of
maryland
included
more
than
a
whisper
about
eligibility
to
sue
the
matter
on
which
the
wisconsin
case
foundered
last
june
instead
the
justices
dwelt
on
the
question
of
justiciability
whether
gerrymandering
is
even
something
courts
can
tackle
the
lawyer
representing
north
carolina's
legislators
paul
clement
began
by
noting
that
the
supreme
court
has
never
pinpointed
a
justiciable
standard
for
partisan
gerrymandering
claims
that
is
true
in
a
case
from
justice
kennedy
held
open
the
possibility
that
a
workable
standard
might
one
day
emerge
to
distinguish
extreme
from
acceptable
levels
of
partisanship
in
map-making
that
the
court
has
never
arrived
at
one
mr
clement
said
is
not
for
lack
of
judicial
imagination
but
because
the
framers
entrusted
districting
to
state
legislatures
with
congress
playing
a
supervisory
role
all
three
authors
of
the
federalist
papers
were
concerned
about
gerrymandering
he
said
but
neither
alexander
hamilton
james
madison
nor
john
jay
prescribed
a
judicial
solution
justice
stephen
breyer
pressed
mr
clement
to
consider
a
way
to
catch
real
outliers
what
if
a
party
wins
a
majority
of
the
votes
in
a
state
he
mused
but
the
other
party
gets
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
seats
is
that
result
extreme
enough
to
warrant
judicial
intervention
perhaps
mr
clement
replied
if
the
constitution
had
a
one-standard-deviation-from-proportional-representation
clause
but
it
does
not
there
are
no
moorings
for
a
judicial
foray
into
the
waters
of
partisan
gerrymandering
luckily
mr
clement
said
citing
a
suggestion
from
retired
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
problem
is
largely
self-healing
as
voters
will
push
for
reforms
and
punish
excessive
gerrymanders
by
voting
out
governors
who
approve
them
justice
neil
gorsuch
picked
up
on
this
in
response
to
the
claim
that
the
supreme
court
must
act
because
nobody
else
can
about
states
he
noted
have
dealt
with
this
problem
through
citizen
initiatives
handing
over
map-drawing
to
bipartisan
or
independent
commissions
and
a
bunch
more
will
be
on
the
ballot
in
justice
kavanaugh
agreed
that
a
fair
amount
of
activity
in
the
states
may
free
the
supreme
court
from
the
big
lift
of
policing
partisan
gerrymandering
but
in
the
hearing
on
maryland's
gerrymander
justice
kavanaugh
who
grew
up
in
the
state
and
lives
in
chevy
chase
a
suburb
of
washington
dc
seemed
to
envision
a
role
for
the
courts
in
checking
legislators
who
penalise
voters
because
of
their
political
affiliation
teaming
up
with
justice
elena
kagan
who
said
a
ruling
against
extreme
partisanship
could
weed
out
the
worst
of
the
worst
gerrymanders
by
putting
legislators
on
notice
justice
kavanaugh
appeared
to
think
a
line
might
be
drawn
whereas
a
mild
partisan
effect
from
an
electoral
map
would
not
trigger
judicial
reprimand
he
said
something
that's
really
extreme
would
not
be
okay
some
justices
fret
that
gerrymandering
will
only
get
worse
with
as
justice
breyer
put
it
computers
in
the
future
drawing
districts
with
increasing
precision
but
none
of
the
nine
seems
hungry
for
an
avalanche
of
challenges
after
electoral
maps
are
redrawn
with
census
data
the
court's
decision
will
probably
turn
on
its
response
to
a
warning
from
mr
clement
once
you
get
into
the
political
thicket
he
cautioned
you
will
not
get
out
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
