why
california's
governor
is
suing
huntington
beach
can
a
lawsuit
compel
upscale
cities
to
build
more
housing
how
many
governors
start
their
administrations
suing
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
iconic
cities
in
the
state
asks
gavin
newsom
california's
new
governor
sitting
in
his
office
in
the
state
capitol
not
many
however
in
january
soon
after
mr
newsom
was
sworn
in
the
state
attorney-general's
office
at
the
governor's
behest
sued
huntington
beach
a
coastal
city
in
orange
county
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
state's
housing-supply
law
i
love
huntington
beach
mr
newsom
insists
now
i'm
going
to
have
a
hard
time
walking
the
streets
down
there
a
warm
welcome
to
surf
city
as
huntington
beach
is
known
may
not
be
in
mr
newsom's
future
but
that
is
not
what
he
was
hoping
for
anyway
california
has
a
severe
shortage
of
affordable
housing
and
he
wants
to
bring
a
sense
of
urgency
to
the
problem
the
state
has
the
highest
poverty
rate
in
america
when
adjusted
for
the
cost
of
living
one-third
of
renters
pay
more
than
half
of
their
income
towards
rent
and
homeownership
rates
in
the
state
are
at
their
lowest
level
since
the
s
the
state
saw
around
new
homes
built
annually
over
the
past
years
about
of
what
is
needed
local
governments
restrictions
slow
approval
and
permitting
processes
opposition
from
residents
and
high
development
costs
are
to
blame
the
lawsuit
against
huntington
beach
is
meant
to
be
a
warning
shot
to
cities
that
they
cannot
stonewall
development
fifty
years
ago
the
state
passed
a
housing
element
law
requiring
communities
to
plan
for
new
housing
for
all
income
groups
based
on
forecasts
for
population
growth
in
the
state
legislature
passed
several
bills
to
speed
up
housing
development
and
approvals
until
recently
many
cities
have
not
met
their
housing
numbers
but
faced
little
consequence
they
routinely
put
in
place
restrictions
that
make
development
harder
such
as
erecting
height
restrictions
and
lowering
caps
on
new
housing
developments
this
is
what
happened
in
huntington
beach's
case
according
to
the
state's
lawsuit
which
declares
the
time
for
empty
promises
has
come
to
an
end
the
city
should
not
be
allowed
to
avoid
its
statutory
obligations
any
longer
huntington
beach
is
fighting
back
it
claims
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
already
passed
and
is
asking
a
court
to
toss
out
the
lawsuit
a
hearing
to
decide
this
will
take
place
on
april
rd
the
city
has
itself
sued
the
state
on
several
occasions
in
february
it
filed
two
lawsuits
taking
aim
at
the
state's
housing
laws
last
year
the
city
sued
california
in
a
separate
instance
over
its
sanctuary
state
policy
arguing
that
the
state
cannot
require
the
city
to
comply
with
imposed
limitations
on
police
collaboration
with
immigration
authorities
the
case
is
now
on
appeal
perhaps
this
immigration
spat
is
part
of
why
huntington
beach
is
being
singled
out
now
muses
michael
gates
the
city
attorney
huntington
beach
is
the
only
city
that
has
been
sued
so
far
but
in
his
state
of
the
state
address
in
february
mr
newsom
called
out
cities
for
not
doing
enough
to
build
housing
such
public
shaming
coupled
with
the
huntington
beach
lawsuit
has
brought
dozens
of
local
representatives
to
agree
to
meet
with
the
governor
about
housing
policy
and
several
cities
are
working
to
come
into
compliance
swiftly
mr
newsom
has
also
threatened
to
withhold
funds
from
the
gas
tax
which
is
used
for
local
roads
and
infrastructure
from
cities
that
do
not
meet
housing
goals
everybody
is
upset
about
that
and
it's
exactly
why
i
did
it
there's
got
to
be
consequences
he
says
for
years
local
governments
have
been
able
to
slow-walk
development
with
no
fear
of
repercussion
not
on
mr
newsom's
watch
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
