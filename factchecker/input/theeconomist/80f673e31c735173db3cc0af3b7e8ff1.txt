michael
cohen's
turn
in
the
barrel
the
testimony
from
the
president's
former
fixer
was
at
once
familiar
and
shocking
for
ten
years
michael
cohen
was
donald
trump's
attack
dog
by
his
own
estimate
the
president's
former
fixer
threatened
more
than
people
or
entities
at
mr
trump's
request
but
in
sworn
testimony
before
the
house
oversight
committee
on
february
th
and
armed
with
documents
to
bolster
several
striking
accusations
mr
cohen
called
his
former
boss
a
racist
a
con
man
and
a
cheat
who
is
fundamentally
disloyal
and
a
threat
to
american
democracy
the
parties
responses
to
his
testimony
hinted
at
how
they
will
respond
to
robert
mueller's
imminently
expected
report
providing
a
preview
of
the
political
battles
likely
to
rage
for
the
rest
of
mr
trump's
term
none
of
mr
cohen's
accusations
were
entirely
new
but
hearing
them
made
openly
before
congress
under
penalty
of
perjury
crystallised
how
extraordinary
they
are
mr
cohen
said
that
mr
trump
knew
in
advance
courtesy
of
roger
stone
a
political
consultant
who
had
been
urging
mr
trump
to
seek
the
presidency
for
decades
that
wikileaks
would
release
stolen
emails
damaging
to
hillary
clinton's
campaign
that
may
have
violated
federal
campaign-finance
law
which
bars
americans
from
accepting
any
thing
of
value
from
foreign
nationals
more
importantly
it
would
make
the
campaign
complicit
in
an
attack
by
a
foreign
intelligence
service
mr
cohen
also
entered
into
evidence
a
pair
of
cheques
one
signed
by
mr
trump
from
his
personal
account
and
the
other
from
his
trust
account
each
for
both
from
after
he
took
office
which
he
said
were
reimbursements
for
hush
money
paid
to
a
pornographic-film
actress
mr
cohen
says
that
as
late
as
february
mr
trump
told
mr
cohen
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
about
these
payments
he
also
brought
three
financial-disclosure
statements
to
illustrate
his
claim
that
mr
trump
inflated
his
net
worth
when
he
wanted
people
to
think
he
was
rich
and
deflated
it
to
minimise
his
taxes
in
according
to
the
statements
his
net
worth
rose
from
bn
to
bn
due
largely
to
his
brand
value
which
mr
trump
did
not
mention
in
but
by
was
somehow
worth
bn
questioned
by
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
who
showed
that
she
was
almost
as
effective
an
interrogator
as
she
is
a
tweeter
mr
cohen
said
that
mr
trump
also
inflated
the
value
of
his
assets
to
an
insurance
firm
which
would
count
as
fraud
mr
cohen
said
mr
trump
knew
of
and
directed
the
trump
moscow
negotiations
throughout
the
campaign
and
lied
about
it
he
said
he
briefed
mr
trump
as
well
as
donald
junior
and
ivanka
about
the
project
around
ten
times
in
mr
cohen
said
he
knew
of
no
direct
evidence
that
mr
trump
or
his
campaign
colluded
with
russia
but
he
said
i
have
my
suspicions
noting
that
mr
trump's
desire
to
win
at
all
costs
made
it
conceivable
that
he
would
collude
with
a
foreign
power
republicans
on
the
committee
did
not
really
defend
the
president
from
these
accusations
instead
they
implied
that
mr
cohen's
testimony
was
some
sort
of
plot
to
land
a
lucrative
book
or
film
contract
and
they
impugned
his
character
noting
that
he
was
convicted
of
lying
to
congress
among
other
things
and
will
soon
begin
a
three-year
prison
sentence
but
literary
glory
aside
it
is
unclear
what
mr
cohen's
motivation
to
lie
to
congress
again
would
be
particularly
as
mr
mueller's
office
was
certainly
watching
and
would
doubtless
have
charged
him
again
had
he
done
so
mr
trump
can
take
comfort
in
the
justice
department
policy
which
warns
against
indicting
a
sitting
president
and
campaign-finance
convictions
are
hard
to
win
in
federal
prosecutors
failed
to
convict
john
edwards
a
democratic
politician
for
spending
donor
funds
on
hush-money
payments
to
a
mistress
still
mr
cohen
accused
the
president
of
conduct
more
serious
than
that
which
led
to
impeachment
for
bill
clinton
lying
about
an
extramarital
affair
and
which
is
comparable
to
richard
nixon's
covering-up
a
break-in
at
democratic
headquarters
for
mr
trump
that
ending
remains
a
long
way
off
while
he
has
solid
republican
support
democrats
will
shy
away
from
impeachment
but
the
prospect
is
closer
now
than
it
was
before
mr
cohen
testified
diplomacy

the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
