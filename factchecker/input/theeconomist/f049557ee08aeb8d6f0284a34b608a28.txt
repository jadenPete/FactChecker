what's
going
on
at
the
nra
political
infighting
is
tearing
america's
biggest
gun
lobby
group
apart
how
serious
is
the
mess
at
the
national
rifle
association
wayne
lapierre
who
has
led
the
outfit
since
said
earlier
this
year
that
it
might
be
forced
to
shut
forever
because
of
gun-shy
banks
and
business
owners
that
might
sound
hyperbolic
after
all
nra
propagandists
routinely
claim
some
bogeyman
communists
zombies
violent
anti-second-amendment
extremists
or
new
york's
governor
threaten
nra
members
and
their
constitutional
rights
scaremongering
drums
up
the
dues
that
pay
its
boss
lavishly
yet
this
time
the
lobby
seems
most
intent
on
self-harm
a
clash
of
personalities
is
partly
to
blame
its
ceremonial
president
oliver
north
of
iran-contra
fame
said
last
week
that
a
clear
crisis
besets
the
group
he
then
bungled
an
effort
to
topple
mr
lapierre
as
recently
as
last
week
the
nra
had
gushed
over
mr
north
as
a
rock-solid
purveyor
of
truth
and
defender
of
justice
relentless
in
the
face
of
wrongful
criticism
but
that
was
before
he
reportedly
told
mr
lapierre
to
quit
or
suffer
a
public
letter
about
the
organisation's
leaders
and
financial
practices
mr
lapierre
says
he
stared
down
the
lieutenant-colonel
who
has
now
been
replaced
as
president
that
showdown
took
place
in
indianapolis
where
nra
members
had
flocked
for
their
annual
convention
among
the
worried
supporters
was
president
donald
trump
who
tweeted
that
the
lobby
risks
being
destroyed
if
squabbling
leaders
fail
to
circle
their
wagons
against
a
serious
external
threat
he
meant
a
legal
push
by
new
york
state
where
the
lobby
has
been
registered
since
whose
attorney-general
letitia
james
is
dishing
out
subpoenas
while
asking
if
there
was
financial
malpractice
at
the
nra
no
friend
of
the
lobby
she
once
called
it
a
terrorist
group
at
stake
is
whether
the
legal
case
if
it
goes
against
the
nra
eventually
leads
the
gun
group
to
lose
its
designation
as
a
charity
and
thus
its
tax-free
status
without
those
advantages
the
nra
which
is
secretive
about
its
finances
but
seems
to
be
in
ever
more
serious
debt
could
go
broke
no
one
is
sure
whether
it
really
has
the
m
members
it
claims
survey
data
suggest
that
the
share
of
americans
who
own
guns
is
declining
although
people
who
do
possess
them
own
more
than
they
used
to
but
one
measure
of
the
nra's
straitened
condition
is
that
in
the
mid-terms
gun-control
groups
outspent
it
in
an
election
for
the
first
time
that
was
quite
a
turnaround
the
gun
lobby
dished
up
m
to
help
get
mr
trump
elected
in
the
greatest
problem
for
the
lobby
may
thus
prove
to
be
financial
an
investigation
by
the
trace
which
studies
the
firearms
industry
and
the
new
yorker
recently
provided
evidence
of
questionable
practices
involving
nra
bosses
and
ackerman
mcqueen
an
advertising
agency
in
oklahoma
the
firm
takes
a
hefty
m
a
year
from
the
nra
for
marketing
and
more
and
is
behind
some
big
and
costly
efforts
to
expand
its
media
presence
for
example
with
a
tv
channel
the
nra's
recent
decision
to
sue
its
agency
seems
to
have
triggered
mr
north's
putsch
against
mr
lapierre
no
wonder
that
opponents
of
the
nra
sound
gleeful
over
its
mishaps
andrew
cuomo
new
york's
governor
crowed
that
the
gig
is
up
for
the
nra
because
people
now
know
the
truth
as
more
members
learn
that
the
boss
reportedly
takes
home
m
each
year
their
enthusiasm
might
wane
but
don't
write
him
off
yet
in
the
s
mr
lapierre
made
an
enemy
of
a
sitting
republican
president
george
h.w.
bush
and
the
nra
was
said
to
be
insolvent
he
and
the
gun
lobby
bounced
back
from
that
they
could
do
