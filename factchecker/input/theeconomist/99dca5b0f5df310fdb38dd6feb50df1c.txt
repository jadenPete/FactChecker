donald
trump's
presidency
has
moved
america
left
the
right
nation
was
last
this
enthusiastic
about
left-wing
policies
in
americans
are
more
in
favour
of
big-government
policies
today
than
at
any
point
in
the
last
years
that
is
the
conclusion
of
james
stimson
a
political
scientist
who
has
analysed
long-running
polls
from
the
universities
of
chicago
and
michigan
to
come
up
with
annual
estimates
of
the
public
mood
mr
stimson
estimates
that
the
last
time
america
was
feeling
this
left-wing
was
in
when
the
civil-rights
movement
was
full-steam
ahead
and
alan
shepard
became
the
first
american
to
be
launched
into
outer
space
public
opinion
is
contradictory
many
more
americans
describe
themselves
as
conservative
than
as
liberal
yet
americans
prefer
left-leaning
policies
to
right-leaning
ones
even
when
these
are
accompanied
by
the
promise
of
higher
taxes
mr
stimson's
data
show
a
steady
leftward
shift
in
americans
views
on
the
scope
of
government
since
and
according
to
data
from
the
policy
agendas
project
an
academic
research
group
the
public
also
holds
views
that
are
more
tolerant
than
ever
on
social
issues
like
same-sex
marriage
worries
more
about
the
environment
and
is
more
enthusiastic
about
immigration
and
giving
a
helping
hand
to
african-americans
the
american
public's
preferences
on
policy
have
long
shown
an
allergy
to
whatever
the
occupant
of
the
white
house
is
trying
to
do
in
this
respect
public
opinion
is
like
a
thermostat
when
policy
gets
too
hot
americans
turn
the
temperature
down
when
the
government
drifts
too
far
right
americans
want
to
move
back
to
the
left
as
happened
in
the
mid-term
elections
mr
stimson
is
careful
not
to
suggest
that
the
leftward
swing
is
only
a
reaction
to
donald
trump's
presidency
he
points
out
that
the
policy
preferences
he
sees
now
are
the
issues
of
american
politics
of
earlier
generations
the
new
deal
and
great
society
agenda
mr
trump
has
done
little
to
shift
policy
on
social
security
for
example
so
increasing
leftiness
on
that
issue
may
reflect
real
attitude-changes
rather
than
thermostat-tweaking
on
policy
preferences
at
least
america
is
moving
leftwards
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
