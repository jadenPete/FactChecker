there
is
more
to
north
carolina's
special
election
than
donald
trump
nc-
has
been
becoming
more
competitive
for
a
decade
donald
trump
has
merely
speeded
that
up
the
mid-term
elections
in
filled
quietly
and
without
notable
controversy
nearly
all
of
the
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
election
in
north
carolina's
ninth
congressional
district
was
an
exception
in
the
ten
months
since
last
november's
contest
the
district
has
been
the
focus
of
several
trials
for
election
fraud
a
restructuring
of
the
state
election
supervisory
board
and
the
departure
of
a
discredited
would-be
congressman
after
september
th
if
all
goes
according
to
plan
residents
of
the
ninth
district
will
at
last
have
a
representative
in
congress
the
race
is
close
in
a
district
that
has
sent
republicans
to
washington
in
every
election
since
that
alone
is
remarkable
the
election
in
nc-
which
stretches
from
suburban
charlotte
through
the
backwoods
of
the
tar
heel
state
was
invalidated
in
february
after
campaign
operatives
for
the
republican
candidate
mark
harris
were
accused
of
falsifying
absentee
votes
leslie
mcrae
dowless
a
low-level
campaign
organiser
and
the
mastermind
of
the
operation
has
since
been
indicted
for
obstruction
of
justice
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice
and
unlawful
possession
of
absentee
ballots
mr
dowless
allegedly
ran
a
similar
scheme
in
the
general
election
and
the
primary
in
which
mr
harris
defeated
the
incumbent
republican
robert
pittenger
mr
pittenger
who
now
works
to
educate
parliamentarians
in
allied
countries
about
surveillance
counterterrorism
and
intelligence-sharing
blames
mr
dowless
for
his
loss
in
last
year's
primary
it
was
all
fraud
he
says
yet
although
he
misses
representing
his
fellow
carolinians
in
washington
i
loved
the
job
he
did
not
seek
the
republican
nomination
for
next
week's
special
election
instead
the
party
picked
dan
bishop
a
republican
state
senator
to
run
for
the
seat
in
more
normal
times
mr
bishop
ought
to
be
a
shoo-in
yet
with
every
election
seemingly
a
referendum
on
president
donald
trump
these
are
not
those
times
the
tightness
of
the
race
is
not
only
a
trump
phenomenon
though
nc-
which
was
once
as
friendly
to
republicans
as
a
church
picnic
on
the
lawn
of
a
country
club
to
celebrate
barry
goldwater's
birthday
has
been
becoming
steadily
more
competitive
for
a
decade
as
its
fields
and
trees
have
been
replaced
by
suburbs
and
parking
lots
in
voters
in
the
district
gave
the
republican
candidate
a
vote
share
that
was
points
higher
than
the
nationwide
republican
tally
in
the
district
was
leaning
to
the
right
by
just
percentage
points
see
chart
mr
harris
defeated
his
democratic
challenger
dan
mccready
an
ex-marine
by
a
mere
votes
last
year
and
that
includes
the
cheating
in
light
of
the
seat's
newfound
competitiveness
money
has
flooded
in
according
to
number-crunching
by
the
centre
for
responsive
politics
a
non-partisan
research
group
mr
mccready
has
raised
m
whereas
mr
bishop
has
raised
m
according
to
political
polling
the
race
remains
close
one
survey
from
harper
polling
found
mr
mccready
beating
mr
bishop
by
four
percentage
points
within
the
margin
of
error
while
another
survey
from
the
democratic
firm
alg
research
found
the
two
candidates
tied
on
each
mccready
appears
to
have
a
slight
edge
but
the
election
could
go
either
way
with
luck
this
time
nobody
will
stuff
the
ballot
boxes
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing

europe's
