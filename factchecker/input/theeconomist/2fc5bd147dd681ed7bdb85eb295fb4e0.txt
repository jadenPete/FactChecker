elizabeth
warren's
unusual
brand
of
wonkish
populism
if
democrats
awarded
prizes
for
detailed
policy
proposals
she
would
win
elizabeth
warren
the
massachusetts
senator
known
best
for
railing
against
big
banks
and
billionaires
was
a
registered
republican
for
a
spell
in
the
s
it
is
an
odd
bit
of
biography
for
mrs
warren
who
is
now
running
for
president
as
a
democrat
and
is
routinely
caricatured
as
the
anti-capitalist
antichrist
unlike
bernie
sanders
who
proudly
describes
himself
as
a
socialist
mrs
warren
has
said
she
is
a
capitalist
to
my
bones
government
she
thinks
should
be
in
the
business
of
repairing
market
failures
she
wishes
to
arrest
inequality
not
just
through
redistribution
by
boosting
welfare
and
entitlement
spending
but
predistribution
which
means
rewriting
rules
that
contribute
to
lopsided
incomes
in
the
first
place
a
brainy
wonk
with
a
populist
edge
she
has
pumped
out
ideas
that
are
at
times
brilliant
at
others
outlandish
but
seldom
half-baked
or
easily
dismissed
the
best
way
to
understand
mrs
warren's
worldview
is
to
examine
her
academic
work
before
she
went
to
washington
she
was
a
law
professor
at
harvard
having
grown
up
working-class
in
oklahoma
preoccupied
with
the
study
of
debt
credit
and
bankruptcy
her
scholarship
began
as
an
exploration
of
middle-class
financial
instability
she
published
research
in
the
early
s
revealing
an
extraordinary
increase
in
bankruptcy
filings
over
two
decades
with
many
by
middle-class
families
mrs
warren
showed
that
the
combination
of
precarious
family
finances
with
poorly
regulated
markets
created
opportunities
for
predatory
lending
says
elisabeth
jacobs
the
senior
director
for
family
economic
security
at
the
washington
centre
for
equitable
growth
a
left-leaning
think-tank
in
the
two-income
trap
a
book
written
with
her
daughter
in
mrs
warren
explored
the
reasons
for
this
even
though
more
women
were
going
to
work
boosting
household
incomes
family
finances
were
increasingly
fragile
armed
with
second
incomes
and
deregulated
credit
instruments
these
families
bid
up
the
cost
of
housing
in
areas
near
good
schools
making
them
more
vulnerable
financially
rather
than
less
interestingly
one
of
her
proposed
solutions
at
the
time
was
a
universal
school-choice
voucher
to
try
to
decouple
housing
and
schooling
an
intriguing
idea
that
would
be
less
than
welcome
in
contemporary
democratic
circles
that
book
was
a
nod
towards
mrs
warren's
future
fixations
in
it
she
also
introduced
her
toaster
analogy
no
regulator
would
allow
the
sale
of
a
toaster
with
a
one-in-five
chance
of
burning
down
a
house
yet
there
is
no
similar
concern
over
mortgages
with
a
one-in-five
chance
of
wrecking
a
family's
finances
this
would
become
the
founding
metaphor
for
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
a
federal
agency
which
was
her
brainchild
and
catapulted
her
from
academic
obscurity
to
national
fame
since
winning
her
senate
seat
in
mrs
warren
and
her
staff
have
busied
themselves
publishing
proposals
on
taxation
corporate
governance
lobbying
housing
and
health
care
she
proposes
a
wealth
tax
on
those
with
fortunes
above
m
to
stymie
the
growth
of
inequality
and
fund
other
programmes
thomas
piketty
the
french
economist
who
wrote
capital
in
the
twenty-first
century
has
long
advocated
a
similar
policy
an
accompanying
analysis
by
emmanuel
saez
and
gabriel
zucman
two
economists
and
collaborators
with
mr
piketty
suggests
that
such
a
tax
would
raise
trn
over
years
their
assumptions
are
probably
too
rosy
the
wealthy
are
good
at
avoiding
taxes
and
determining
the
size
of
fortunes
is
trickier
than
tracking
annual
incomes
mr
piketty's
native
france
has
ditched
its
wealth
tax
to
predistribute
income
mrs
warren
would
give
more
economic
power
to
workers
imitating
german
industry
by
letting
workers
elect
at
least
of
the
seats
on
corporate
boards
importing
the
german
context
of
less
adversarial
labour
relations
would
prove
harder
when
it
comes
to
fixing
america's
health-care
system
perhaps
the
industry
most
plagued
by
market
failure
mrs
warren
is
more
cautious
than
some
other
prominent
democrats
she
has
offered
proposals
to
shore
up
the
insurance
exchanges
set
up
under
obamacare
she
has
also
put
forward
legislation
which
would
inject
competition
into
the
generic-drugs
market
which
is
rife
with
anti-competitive
behaviour
by
setting
up
a
public
manufacturer
of
drugs
yet
she
also
co-sponsored
mr
sanders's
medicare
for
all
bill
which
would
upend
the
american
health
system
transforming
it
into
a
single-payer
model
by
eliminating
private
health
insurance
and
rapidly
increasing
taxes
the
two
approaches
cannot
coexist
but
paying
fealty
to
left-of-centre
slogans
that
stand
little
chance
of
becoming
law
may
be
the
price
of
running
in
the
democratic
primary
mrs
warren's
most
intriguing
plans
concern
housing
high
rents
in
productive
cities
limit
opportunity
and
economic
growth
fixing
this
with
federal
policy
is
difficult
since
planning
laws
are
so
decentralised
mrs
warren
proposes
to
coax
cities
into
changing
restrictive
development
rules
for
a
share
of
a
large
pot
of
money
bn
in
total
while
also
funding
large
public-housing
developments
a
paper
by
mark
zandi
chief
economist
for
moody's
analytics
claims
that
this
could
bring
rents
for
low-income
families
down
by
she
also
wants
the
federal
government
to
assist
first-time
homebuyers
in
formerly
segregated
neighbourhoods
on
matters
of
trade
and
foreign
policy
mrs
warren's
thinking
is
less
sophisticated
she
applies
her
domestic
mantra
that
market
failure
and
corporate
greed
are
the
taproots
of
dysfunction
to
international
affairs
with
peculiar
results
if
the
american
economy
is
rigged
then
trade
deals
are
meta-riggings
of
the
global
economy
crafted
by
multinational
firms
to
weaken
american
labour
relative
to
capital
in
a
recent
essay
for
foreign
affairs
mrs
warren
sketched
out
a
foreign-policy
manifesto
of
sorts
it
includes
standard
stuff
for
democrats
a
dislike
of
foreign
entanglements
and
a
suspicion
that
defence
spending
is
inflated
but
she
also
struggled
to
escape
domestic
concerns
her
bold
new
proposal
is
that
us
foreign
policy
should
not
prioritise
corporate
profits
over
american
families
daniel
drezner
a
professor
at
tufts
university
describes
this
as
trumpism
with
a
human
face
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
