race
plays
an
ever-more
important
role
in
voting
meanwhile
racial
prejudice
is
declining
more
than
a
decade
after
america
elected
its
first
black
president
fears
of
worsening
racial
tensions
are
palpable
a
poll
in
february
from
the
pew
research
centre
a
think-tank
found
that
of
americans
think
race
relations
are
generally
bad
and
believe
it
has
become
more
acceptable
to
express
racist
views
since
donald
trump
was
elected
president
some
have
used
these
data
to
assert
that
racists
have
been
emboldened
by
mr
trump's
victory
and
are
perpetrating
hate
crimes
against
their
neighbours
at
higher
rates
than
before
a
picture
that
seems
to
be
confirmed
by
attacks
on
synagogues
or
by
marching
white
supremacists
this
is
misleading
however
over
the
past
ten
years
racial
biases
have
become
less
pronounced
in
america
it
is
possible
that
its
citizens
are
more
tolerant
today
than
they
have
ever
been
before
america
has
faced
two
major
barriers
to
racial
equality
one
of
them
legal
with
slavery
and
racial
discrimination
at
its
core
and
the
other
psychological
the
first
of
these
walls
was
mostly
knocked
down
with
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
which
prevents
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
though
struggles
against
racism
remained
long
after
a
harder-to-solve
barrier
to
fairness
is
the
prevalence
of
bias
against
non-whites
researchers
call
known
attitudes
such
as
agreeing
with
the
statement
i
think
black
people
are
lazier
than
whites
explicit
biases
and
hidden
beliefs
such
as
unintentionally
associating
african-americans
with
fear
or
evil
more
often
than
whites
implicit
biases
both
kinds
are
a
problem
scholars
have
found
that
implicit
biases
impede
impartiality
in
the
education
system
for
example
and
can
cause
police
officers
to
stop
black
drivers
for
no
good
reason
much
more
often
than
white
ones
tessa
charlesworth
and
mahzarin
banaji
psychologists
at
harvard
university
recently
published
an
analysis
of
m
results
from
an
online
test
of
americans
biases
the
test
called
an
implicit-association
test
iat
scores
biases
based
on
how
quickly
a
person
associates
black
and
white
faces
with
nouns
like
good
and
bad
or
joyful
and
evil
if
someone
is
quicker
to
categorise
one
race
positively
or
the
other
negatively
they
are
said
to
be
biased
the
authors
found
that
implicit
biases
based
on
race
have
decreased
by
approximately
in
a
decade
they
also
found
that
explicit
biases
have
declined
by
an
even-larger
exactly
why
this
should
have
happened
remains
a
puzzle
ms
charlesworth
suggests
that
the
media
and
public
discussions
play
a
large
role
pundits
frequently
discuss
efforts
to
change
racial
biases
and
the
more
times
we
talk
about
trying
to
change
an
attitude
the
more
likely
we
are
to
succeed
in
actually
doing
so
declining
racial
bias
has
produced
a
host
of
changes
housing
patterns
show
some
of
the
clearest
signs
of
thawing
attitudes
whites
are
steadily
moving
into
predominantly
black
neighbourhoods
in
search
of
lower
house
prices
the
share
of
non-whites
in
suburban
and
rural
areas
is
increasing
too
pew's
data
show
that
the
share
of
republican-aligned
americans
who
say
the
country
needs
to
do
more
to
ensure
equal
rights
for
blacks
and
whites
climbed
from
in
to
in
that
shift
is
even
more
pronounced
in
the
democratic
party
over
the
same
period
the
share
of
democrats
who
said
the
same
increased
from
to
a
change
linked
to
the
greater
importance
of
anti-racism
for
democrats
now
compared
with
before
barack
obama's
election
as
noticeable
as
they
have
become
feelings
about
white
identity
have
actually
mellowed
on
some
measures
john
sides
a
political
scientist
and
co-author
of
a
book
on
identity
and
the
election
notes
that
the
share
of
respondents
to
the
american
national
election
studies
anes
a
survey
from
the
university
of
michigan
who
strongly
identify
as
white
and
perceive
discrimination
against
whites
fell
between
and
yet
while
all
this
progress
has
been
going
on
american
politics
has
become
more
polarised
on
racial
lines
rather
than
less
as
high-school-educated
whites
have
abandoned
the
democratic
party
racial
identity
has
melded
with
political
preferences
in
reaction
to
mr
obama's
election
and
threatened
by
the
rising
status
of
non-whites
a
significant
share
of
americans
have
embraced
the
politics
of
solidarity
with
other
whites
a
good
predictor
of
support
for
donald
trump
in
was
whether
or
not
a
voter
agreed
with
whether
it
was
extremely
or
very
important
for
whites
to
work
together
to
change
laws
that
are
unfair
to
whites
a
sentiment
shared
by
of
trump
voters
according
to
the
anes
this
does
not
mean
that
support
for
the
president
is
motivated
by
simple
racism
as
his
opponents
frequently
imply
those
who
say
they
identify
more
with
whites
do
not
always
prefer
white
to
black
americans
in
her
recent
book
white
identity
politics
ashley
jardina
a
political
scientist
finds
that
of
white
americans
are
unabashed
racists
a
much
larger
group
of
whites
of
the
total
feel
a
strong
attachment
to
their
whiteness
and
yet
do
not
express
racial
bias
at
least
one
route
exists
to
reducing
the
importance
of
race
in
politics
the
combination
of
mr
obama
leaving
office
and
mr
trump's
racist
remarks
on
the
campaign
trail
made
race
salient
in
if
other
issues
come
to
the
fore
in
then
racial
issues
could
have
less
impact
on
voters
decisions
than
they
did
in
says
mr
sides
america
has
become
politically
polarised
along
racial
lines
america
has
not
become
more
racist
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
