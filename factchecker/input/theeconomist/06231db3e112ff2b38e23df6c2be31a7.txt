democratic
presidential
candidates
are
making
promises
they
cannot
deliver
even
if
one
of
them
beats
donald
trump
their
most
ambitious
schemes
are
bound
to
be
undone
by
electoral
reality
to
be
noticed
in
the
crowded
democratic
presidential
primaries
it
helps
to
toss
out
a
sweeping
policy
proposal
or
two
bernie
sanders
the
socialist
senator
from
vermont
who
took
this
approach
in
his
unsuccessful
challenge
to
hillary
clinton
in
would
still
like
free
public
college
tuition
and
medicare
for
all
after
a
slow
start
elizabeth
warren
the
senior
senator
from
massachusetts
is
enjoying
a
little
polling
bounce
as
reward
for
her
proposals
to
break
up
big
tech
firms
impose
a
wealth
tax
on
the
ultra-rich
and
bring
in
universal
child
care
upstarts
have
latched
onto
the
strategy
too
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
would
like
to
pack
the
supreme
court
with
six
more
justices
andrew
yang
an
entrepreneur
with
a
large
online
following
has
made
a
universal
basic
income
his
defining
issue
actually
accomplishing
any
of
these
things
will
prove
much
harder
than
advertised
because
even
if
democrats
were
to
take
the
white
house
in
they
look
unlikely
to
take
control
of
the
senate
it
may
seem
obvious
to
point
out
that
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
will
first
have
to
defeat
mr
trump
before
remaking
the
american
health-care
system
yet
when
debating
their
two
dozen
and
counting
choices
party
activists
sometimes
sound
as
if
dethroning
mr
trump
whom
betting
markets
now
give
a
chance
of
re-election
is
inevitable
americans
usually
like
to
re-elect
their
presidents
when
the
economy
is
doing
well
in
april
the
unemployment
rate
hit
a
year
low
the
chance
of
some
presidential
meltdown
delivering
a
crushing
democratic
victory
seems
slight
though
mr
trump
remains
unpopular
with
approval
ratings
hovering
around
his
supporters
are
unyielding
a
slew
of
scandals
from
the
jailing
of
his
close
associates
to
the
caging
of
migrant
children
at
the
border
have
had
little
measurable
effect
on
his
popularity
even
if
mr
trump
lost
the
democrats
less-discussed
senate
problem
would
persist
although
it
is
theoretically
possible
for
a
future
democratic
president
to
assemble
cross-party
majorities
to
pass
legislation
continued
partisan
trench-warfare
seems
more
likely
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
single
republican
voting
for
a
wealth
tax
for
matt
bennett
of
third
way
a
centre-left
think-tank
chastened
republicans
could
revert
to
being
partisan
but
not
preposterous
after
trumpism
breaks
its
hold
over
the
party
the
debate
might
then
fall
between
kitchen-table
ideas
like
gradual
expansions
of
health-insurance
coverage
which
might
stand
a
chance
and
brooklyn
coffee-shop
thumb-sucker
ones
like
medicare
for
all
or
abolishing
the
country's
immigration-enforcement
agency
which
would
not
democrats
would
therefore
need
a
working
senate
majority
to
get
more
ambitious
schemes
through
out
of
senators
are
reliable
democrats
to
win
back
control
of
the
chamber
the
party
would
need
to
pick
up
a
minimum
of
three
seats
and
also
win
the
presidency
since
the
vice-president's
vote
breaks
ties
that
does
not
sound
too
hard
but
even
a
net
gain
of
three
seats
looks
a
stretch
because
of
the
way
the
upper
chamber
over-represents
rural
america
though
it
is
early
betting
markets
rate
democrats
chances
of
winning
a
senate
majority
at
to
wrest
seats
away
from
incumbents
in
difficult
territory
the
party
needs
high-quality
candidates
to
run
yet
top-tier
candidates
are
instead
opting
to
be
second-
or
third-tier
presidential
candidates
beto
o'rourke
who
nearly
upset
ted
cruz
in
his
run
for
the
texas
senate
would
be
the
prime
candidate
to
challenge
john
cornyn
the
state's
other
republican
senator
but
is
instead
aiming
for
the
white
house
at
least
mr
o'rourke
is
registering
a
few
percentage
points
in
the
polls
the
same
cannot
be
said
of
steve
bullock
the
popular
democratic
governor
of
montana
who
is
opting
to
run
for
president
rather
than
challenging
steve
daines
the
state's
lone
republican
senator
about
of
americans
do
not
yet
know
mr
bullock
well
enough
to
rate
his
favourability
according
to
a
recent
poll
from
yougov
stacey
abrams
who
lost
a
close
contest
for
governor
in
georgia
and
who
has
the
diary
schedule
of
someone
who
is
running
for
something
has
said
she
will
not
stand
for
the
senate
even
without
the
distracting
draw
of
the
white
house
recruiting
troubles
persist
josh
stein
the
attorney-general
of
north
carolina
would
be
the
obvious
candidate
to
challenge
thom
tillis
but
he
has
declined
tom
vilsack
a
prominent
former
governor
of
iowa
has
ruled
out
a
challenge
to
joni
ernst
even
if
they
were
to
win
a
narrow
senate
majority
that
would
not
automatically
result
in
the
kind
of
new
new
deal
that
democratic
activists
seem
to
dream
of
surmounting
the
filibuster
which
requires
a
super-majority
of
votes
for
legislation
will
be
impossible
without
republican
votes
ms
warren
has
endorsed
eliminating
the
filibuster
as
has
mr
buttigieg
her
senate
colleagues
and
competitors
cory
booker
kirsten
gillibrand
and
kamala
harris
are
more
skittish
even
though
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
some
of
their
signature
campaign
issues
gun
control
for
mr
booker
paid
family
leave
and
abortion
rights
for
ms
gillibrand
and
marijuana
legalisation
for
ms
harris
attracting
eight
or
so
breakaway
republican
supporters
many
current
policy
debates
would
be
rendered
practically
meaningless
by
divided
government
or
even
by
a
slim
democratic
majority
in
the
upper
chamber
a
hypothetical
president
joe
biden
and
a
president
elizabeth
warren
would
accomplish
much
the
same
in
legislative
terms
which
is
to
say
next
to
nothing
in
that
scenario
policy
differences
over
foreign
affairs
and
trade
where
the
president
does
have
a
lot
of
unilateral
power
would
matter
more
but
these
are
hardly
being
debated
the
people
chosen
by
a
president
biden
or
warren
to
run
the
regulatory
agencies
would
push
in
the
same
centre-left
direction
reversing
rollbacks
of
environmental
protections
under
this
administration
creating
more
expansive
definitions
of
civil
rights
and
pushing
anti-trust
regulators
to
be
bolder
these
are
not
insignificant
powers
but
proposals
for
sweeping
social
change
the
kind
that
will
be
offered
by
candidates
in
the
primary
debates
would
probably
languish
in
committees
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
