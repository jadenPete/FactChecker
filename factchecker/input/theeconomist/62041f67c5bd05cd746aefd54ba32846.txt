america
grapples
with
a
lethal
mix
of
terrorism
and
lax
gun
laws
after
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
calls
for
change
are
unlikely
to
yield
results
they
looked
like
something
out
of
donald
trump's
fever
dream
a
bunch
of
burly
bearded
tattooed
latinos
massed
outside
a
blood
bank
wielding
metal
objects
but
the
objects
were
spoons
and
spatulas
and
the
men
were
christians
on
a
mission
soon
after
a
gunman
killed
nearly
two
dozen
people
at
a
walmart
pastor
anthony
torres
and
members
of
his
flock
stocked
their
mobile
kitchen
and
drove
down
from
alamogordo
new
mexico
in
the
two
days
that
followed
they
served
hundreds
of
meals
to
el
pasoans
who
donated
badly
needed
blood
to
local
hospitals
asked
why
he
brought
nearly
a
dozen
people
a
mobile
kitchen
and
hundreds
of
dollars-worth
of
food
to
another
city
to
help
people
he
had
never
met
mr
torres
just
shrugs
we
felt
we
had
to
be
here
the
el
paso
massacre
was
the
deadliest
of
three
in
less
than
a
week
all
perpetrated
by
young
men
using
legally
purchased
semi-automatic
weapons
the
death
toll
including
two
shooters
stood
at
in
el
paso
four
at
a
festival
in
gilroy
california
and
ten
in
dayton
ohio
with
dozens
left
injured
america
has
grown
accustomed
to
such
events
there
have
been
shootings
with
three
or
more
deaths
in
on
average
according
to
a
research
outfit
called
the
gun
violence
archive
this
year
has
seen
one
shooting
in
which
four
or
more
people
were
killed
or
injured
every
day
two
of
these
attacks
in
gilroy
and
el
paso
are
being
investigated
as
domestic
terrorism
raising
questions
about
how
police
and
politicians
confront
the
threat
from
white-supremacist
terror
on
july
rd
christopher
wray
the
fbi
director
said
his
agency
had
made
around
domestic-terror
arrests
since
october
most
of
them
related
to
white
supremacists
yet
even
though
according
to
the
anti-defamation
league
an
ngo
right-wing
extremists
were
responsible
for
of
killings
apparently
motivated
by
some
extremist
ideology
in
america
between
and
the
counterterrorism
apparatus
remains
geared
more
towards
catching
foreign
terrorists
than
domestic
ones
that
stems
partly
from
a
legal
distinction
providing
money
or
personnel
to
a
designated
foreign-terrorist
group
such
as
al-qaeda
or
isis
is
illegal
no
such
statute
exists
for
domestic
terrorism
and
in
any
case
white-supremacist
attacks
are
carried
out
by
individuals
who
buy
their
own
guns
and
radicalise
themselves
online
initiating
a
terrorism
investigation
based
on
opinions
posted
on
web
forums
gets
into
murky
first
amendment
waters
but
the
imbalance
also
stems
from
priorities
set
at
the
top
former
counterterrorism
analysts
say
that
the
government
does
not
devote
nearly
as
much
intellectual
energy
to
understanding
the
ideology
of
domestic
white
supremacists
and
mapping
out
paths
from
ideology
to
action
as
it
does
to
jihadist
terrorism
even
though
as
clint
watts
a
former
fbi
special
agent
who
worked
on
terrorism
notes
the
two
ideologies
are
structurally
similar
both
argue
that
they
muslims
in
one
case
white
people
in
another
are
superior
and
need
their
own
separate
state
ruled
by
their
own
people
and
are
justified
in
committing
acts
of
violence
in
their
people's
name
despite
that
passing
similarity
the
path
to
radicalisation
seems
different
jihadist
groups
recruited
through
mainstream
platforms
such
as
facebook
twitter
and
youtube
where
they
comprised
a
negligible
share
of
these
firms
revenue
and
users
that
made
it
easy
for
companies
and
governments
to
kick
jihadists
off
these
sites
white-nationalist
extremists
use
smaller
platforms
that
have
no
interest
in
joining
the
mainstream
sometimes
their
service
providers
step
in
cloudflare
for
instance
withdrew
its
web-security
protections
from
chan
a
web
forum
popular
with
the
far
right
these
sites
then
pop
up
elsewhere
hosted
in
an
obscure
jurisdiction
shortly
before
he
began
his
attack
patrick
crusius
the
el
paso
shooter
appears
to
have
posted
a
manifesto
on
chan
he
wrote
that
his
attack
was
a
response
to
the
hispanic
invasion
of
texas
a
state
that
until
was
part
of
mexico
he
railed
against
immigration
and
environmental
damage
and
advocated
decreas
ing
the
number
of
people
in
america
using
resources
if
we
can
just
get
rid
of
enough
people
then
our
way
of
life
can
become
sustainable
towards
that
end
he
travelled
from
the
suburb
of
dallas
where
he
was
brought
up
to
el
paso
a
majority-hispanic
border
city
and
opened
fire
in
a
store
packed
with
back-to-school
shoppers
from
mexico
one
survivor
said
he
specifically
targeted
people
he
thought
were
hispanic
the
hispanic
community
he
wrote
was
not
my
target
until
i
read
the
great
replacement
this
refers
to
a
conspiracy
theory
that
blames
feckless
western
elites
for
replacing
people
of
european
ancestry
with
non-white
immigrants
the
great
replacement
was
the
title
of
a
book
by
a
french
polemicist
brenton
tarrant
an
australian
man
who
earlier
this
year
murdered
people
in
two
mosques
in
new
zealand
used
it
as
the
title
of
his
own
manifesto
which
mr
crusius
endorsed
this
is
an
updated
version
of
an
older
conspiracy
theory
known
as
white
genocide
which
propounds
that
the
world's
white
population
is
being
deliberately
shrunk
and
diluted
through
mass
immigration
low
fertility
rates
multiculturalism
and
miscegenation
mr
crusius
also
inveighed
against
race
mixing
unsurprisingly
many
on
the
far
right
believe
this
to
be
a
jewish
plot
these
beliefs
notes
oren
segal
of
the
anti-defamation
league
are
not
just
on
these
fringe
internet
forums
if
anyone
operating
there
turned
on
fox
news
they
would
hear
similar
sentiments
tucker
carlson
the
second-most-popular
host
on
cable
news
has
said
that
democrats
want
demographic
replacement
through
a
flood
of
illegals
laura
ingraham
another
host
has
argued
that
democrats
want
to
replace
you
the
american
voters
with
newly
amnestied
citizens
and
an
ever-increasing
number
of
chain
migrants
prominent
politicians
have
said
the
same
thing
steve
king
a
congressman
from
iowa
infamously
wrote
that
we
can't
restore
our
civilisation
with
somebody
else's
babies
on
the
house
floor
ted
yoho
and
louie
gohmert
both
republican
congressmen
have
compared
immigrants
to
invaders
during
a
trip
to
europe
in
donald
trump
said
that
immigration
has
changed
the
fabric
of
europe
and
told
a
british
tabloid
i
think
you
are
losing
your
culture
look
around
more
recently
his
facebook
campaign
ads
have
warned
we
have
an
invasion
it's
critical
that
we
stop
the
invasion
take
this
literally
and
violence
becomes
a
defensive
measure
correlation
is
not
causation
but
fbi
data
show
a
recent
uptick
in
reported
hate
crimes
men
who
killed
jews
in
synagogues
in
california
and
pittsburgh
blamed
jews
for
immigrant
invaders
and
the
genocide
of
the
european
race
despite
the
president's
occasional
disavowals
these
people
really
like
him
the
christchurch
shooter
called
mr
trump
a
symbol
of
renewed
white
identity
and
common
purpose
one
researcher
who
attends
extremist
rallies
in
disguise
reports
unanimous
support
for
trump
these
folks
rallied
around
him
they
saw
large
parts
of
their
messaging
getting
into
the
mainstream
to
his
credit
in
a
speech
on
august
th
mr
trump
denounced
racism
bigotry
and
white
supremacy
he
also
advocated
making
it
easier
to
commit
the
mentally
ill
to
hospital
stop
ping
the
glorification
of
violence
in
our
society
and
develop
tools
that
can
detect
mass-shooters
before
they
strike
missing
from
the
list
was
a
commitment
to
moderate
his
own
speech
or
anything
that
would
make
it
substantially
harder
for
angry
young
men
to
obtain
semi-automatic
weapons
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
