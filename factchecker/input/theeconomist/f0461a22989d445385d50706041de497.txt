donald
trump's
efforts
to
boost
the
saudi
alliance
risk
damaging
it
by
celebrating
a
peculiar
relationship
the
president
has
brought
it
into
domestic
politics
not
since
franklin
roosevelt
met
ibn
saud
aboard
the
uss
quincy
in
had
an
american
president
courted
saudi
arabia
as
zealously
as
barack
obama
did
he
visited
the
kingdom
four
times
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
and
twice
as
often
as
he
called
on
any
other
middle
eastern
country
on
his
watch
america
sold
the
saudis
bn-worth
of
arms
and
provided
intelligence
and
jet
fuel
for
their
war
against
yemen's
houthi
rebels
yet
mr
obama
left
office
a
saudi
hate-figure
the
saudis
loathed
his
attempted
pivot
to
asia
his
attempted
detente
with
iran
and
above
all
his
enthusiasm
for
the
pro-democracy
arab
spring
had
president
donald
trump
studied
the
contradictions
in
his
predecessor's
record
his
ambition
to
make
closer
saudi
relations
the
centrepiece
of
his
middle
east
policy
might
have
stood
a
chance
of
success
by
ignoring
them
as
part
of
his
default
effort
to
repudiate
mr
obama
as
he
thought
he
has
pitched
america's
oldest
middle
eastern
alliance
into
a
far
bigger
crisis
mr
obama
justly
described
united
states-saudi
relations
as
complicated
the
two
countries
share
interests
including
america's
desire
for
a
predictable
oil
supply
for
the
global
economy
the
saudis
for
security
and
both
countries
determination
to
peg
back
iran
yet
they
share
no
more
values
or
political
tradition
than
when
roosevelt
met
the
kingdom's
first
monarch
on
his
way
home
from
the
yalta
conference
saudi
arabia
is
an
absolute
monarchy
that
beheaded
people
in
the
first
four
months
of
this
year
and
has
just
throttled
and
dismembered
a
washington
post
columnist
in
its
istanbul
consulate
america
is
the
world's
oldest
democracy
the
result
over
the
past
seven
decades
has
been
a
near-constant
state
of
mutual
incomprehension
cross-cutting
interests
and
periodic
blow-ups
the
worst
of
these
writes
bruce
riedel
in
his
recent
history
of
the
relationship
kings
and
presidents
constituted
near-death
moments
they
include
the
saudi
oil
embargo
after
the
arab-israeli
war
of
and
a
threatened
second
embargo
during
the
second
intifada
in
the
fallout
from
khashoggi's
murder
almost
certainly
on
the
orders
of
the
kingdom's
crown
prince
muhammad
bin
salman
has
the
makings
of
another
more
complicated
existential
glitch
a
bipartisan
effort
in
the
senate
to
censure
mbs
has
become
a
broader
repudiation
of
the
relationship
and
mr
trump's
heightened
ambition
for
it
this
reflects
how
integral
the
crown
prince
is
to
both
the
administration
especially
mr
trump's
own
entitled
princeling
his
son-in-law
jared
kushner
bet
that
by
cultivating
mbs's
relaxed
view
of
israel
he
might
be
persuaded
to
get
the
palestinians
to
negotiate
by
encouraging
his
anti-iran
zeal
it
hoped
to
pile
pressure
on
the
regime
in
tehran
mr
trump
who
made
his
first
overseas
trip
to
riyadh
is
also
fixated
on
the
airy
promises
of
billions
in
investment
he
received
there
the
senate
led
by
republicans
such
as
lindsey
graham
and
marco
rubio
who
are
generally
onside
with
the
president
is
unimpressed
mr
rubio
predicted
khashoggi's
murder
would
blow
apart
mr
trump's
middle
east
strategy
mr
trump's
subsequent
effort
to
deny
mbs's
responsibility
for
the
killing
thereby
contradicting
america's
intelligence
agencies
has
riled
congress
further
it
recalls
for
many
republicans
his
effort
to
absolve
vladimir
putin
of
blame
for
election-hacking
an
issue
they
feel
anxious
about
but
less
able
to
counter
the
president
on
an
arcane
foreign-policy
row
has
thus
become
implicated
in
domestic
political
disagreements
that
will
make
it
harder
to
resolve
this
is
something
all
of
mr
trump's
predecessors
since
roosevelt
sought
to
avoid
by
two
means
by
coaxing
the
saudis
to
improve
their
human-rights
record
they
tried
to
mitigate
the
main
tension
in
the
relationship
only
john
kennedy
who
helped
persuade
them
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
year
the
beatles
recorded
please
please
me
had
much
success
with
that
yet
paying
lip-service
to
american
values
helped
maintain
bipartisan
support
for
the
relationship
by
keeping
relations
fairly
low-key
america's
leaders
also
sought
to
isolate
that
elite
consensus
from
broader
foreign
or
energy
policy
disagreements
as
a
result
every
previous
breakdown
in
the
relationship
has
been
between
the
kings
and
presidents
of
mr
riedel's
book
title
this
in
turn
allowed
for
the
possibility
of
a
revivifying
compromise
when
the
logic
of
shared
interest
kicked
in
again
to
end
the
oil
embargo
henry
kissinger
persuaded
israel
to
withdraw
from
a
scrap
of
syrian
territory
in
george
w.
bush
pledged
his
support
for
a
palestinian
state
mr
trump
ditched
both
time-honoured
precautions
instead
of
softening
the
transactional
nature
of
the
relationship
he
celebrated
it
many
believe
mbs
could
not
have
ordered
khashoggi's
murder
otherwise
instead
of
keeping
the
alliance
discreet
he
trumpeted
it
making
the
murder
even
more
politically
salient
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
if
mr
trump
ruled
as
a
saudi
monarch
this
might
not
matter
the
senate
pushback
shows
he
does
not
and
to
be
fair
even
monarchs
need
to
be
more
cautious
than
mbs
has
been
his
recklessness
of
which
khashoggi's
murder
is
only
the
latest
case
has
been
condemned
by
some
saudi
allies
including
morocco
and
may
foster
dissent
in
the
kingdom
it
is
bad
enough
that
the
us-saudi
relationship
is
now
hostage
to
american
politics
it
may
not
survive
being
hostage
to
saudi
politics
too
the
disaster
has
at
least
revealed
how
unrealistic
the
administration's
saudi
gambit
always
was
mbs
is
a
mercurial
figure
yet
the
notion
that
the
road
to
middle
east
peace
leads
through
riyadh
is
a
pipe-dream
even
royal
dictators
worry
about
public
opinion
and
in
saudi
arabia
it
is
against
compromise
with
israel
the
idea
that
the
saudis
could
help
topple
iran's
mullahs
was
similarly
exaggerated
the
arab
nato
the
saudis
have
floated
is
a
figment
and
the
notion
that
saudi
covert
action
is
formidable
was
exposed
for
all
the
world
by
cctv
images
of
a
bunch
of
saudi
thugs
traipsing
into
istanbul
with
a
bone-saw
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
