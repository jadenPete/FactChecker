joe
biden
is
not
the
best
person
to
take
on
donald
trump
democrats
need
someone
who
can
offer
a
fresh
face
and
new
ideas
joe
biden
was
first
off
a
flight
from
burlington
to
philadelphia
the
other
day
lexington
was
second
which
afforded
him
a
rare
moment
to
observe
the
former
vice-president
in
the
solitude
of
an
empty
jetway
perhaps
mr
biden
knew
he
was
being
spied
on
perhaps
he
always
expects
to
be
after
half
a
century
in
frontline
politics
even
so
to
watch
the
stiff-legged
year-old
stoop
to
pick
up
someone's
empty
soda
bottle
and
transport
it
softly
tutting
to
himself
to
the
nearest
rubbish
bin
was
to
glimpse
a
modesty
and
diligence
not
obvious
in
american
government
these
days
his
reputation
for
being
a
good
guy
has
helped
make
uncle
joe
a
hugely
popular
figure
on
the
left
recent
polls
make
him
the
favourite
for
the
next
democratic
presidential
ticket
the
latest
for
cnn
gives
him
of
the
democratic
vote
with
his
closest
rival
senator
bernie
sanders
trailing
on
mr
biden
who
had
been
speaking
in
burlington
on
a
book
he
published
last
year
promise
me
dad
says
he
will
decide
whether
to
embark
on
his
third
run
for
president
over
christmas
having
visited
states
this
year
he
is
clearly
tempted
to
it
would
be
a
mistake
if
he
did
that
is
not
to
underestimate
his
strengths
which
go
beyond
amiability
as
he
demonstrated
in
burlington
mr
biden
is
a
polished
turn
with
moderate
instincts
and
an
impressive
history
of
courage
in
adversity
newly
elected
to
the
senate
by
delaware
aged
he
suffered
the
death
of
his
wife
and
baby
daughter
in
a
car
crash
leaving
him
with
two
young
sons
to
care
for
the
eldest
beau
a
former
attorney-general
of
delaware
with
his
father's
features
and
easy
charm
died
of
brain
cancer
in
aged
that
deterred
mr
biden
in
the
depths
of
his
grief
from
running
in
as
he
explains
movingly
in
his
book
which
is
part-memoir
for
a
beloved
son
part-campaign
tome
he
was
also
dissuaded
by
barack
obama
who
believed
his
deputy
could
not
beat
hillary
clinton
in
the
primary
he
might
have
been
wrong
especially
if
mr
biden
had
entered
the
race
before
mr
sanders
began
kicking
up
a
storm
and
he
could
certainly
have
beaten
donald
trump
trading
on
his
working-class
roots
and
strong
ties
to
labour
unions
mr
biden
performs
best
in
the
post-industrial
states
such
as
his
native
pennsylvania
that
swung
the
election
for
mr
trump
he
would
also
have
presented
a
less
easy
target
for
the
hard-right
media
than
mrs
clinton
was
but
that
was
then
and
now
mr
biden
seems
too
old
his
supporters
say
his
faculties
are
as
sharp
as
ever
but
his
audiences
would
be
as
likely
to
remember
him
as
the
democrat
vying
to
be
the
oldest
man
ever
elected
president
he's
much
older
than
i
thought
he'd
be
murmured
the
woman
seated
behind
your
columnist
in
burlington
as
the
final
applause
faded
away
mr
trump
and
mr
sanders
the
standout
performers
of
were
also
old
yet
the
fact
that
they
were
politically
unknown
to
most
people
mitigated
the
effect
of
that
mr
sanders's
largely
unproductive
senate
career
also
meant
he
had
few
political
skeletons
to
hurt
him
in
the
primary
unlike
mr
biden
who
voted
for
many
things
during
his
decades
in
congress
that
he
would
be
forced
to
account
for
the
lesson
of
the
past
two
presidential
elections
is
that
voters
want
the
most
novel
candidate
available
to
them
this
suggests
that
mr
biden's
current
strength
his
superior
name
recognition
would
be
a
weakness
even
in
the
flush
of
youth
in
all
truth
he
was
a
lousy
presidential
candidate
his
first
run
in
the
year
before
the
democrats
youngest
incoming
house
member
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
was
born
started
weakly
and
fizzled
quickly
after
he
was
caught
plagiarising
a
speech
by
neil
kinnock
a
british
politician
his
second
in
went
the
same
way
after
several
gaffes
including
his
description
of
mr
obama
his
then
rival
as
unusually
bright
and
clean
for
a
black
candidate
there
is
a
post-trump
view
that
mr
biden's
foot-in-mouth
propensity
would
come
over
as
authentic
and
engaging
yet
his
infelicities
too
often
revive
racial
and
gender
stereotypes
that
no
democrat
could
get
away
with
let
alone
an
old
white
male
one
mr
biden's
tactility
could
be
a
similar
problem
after
a
welcoming
hug
from
the
vice-president
the
elderly
mother
of
one
of
his
then
colleagues
told
him
no
man
has
touched
me
like
that
apart
from
your
father
though
he
has
never
been
accused
of
anything
untoward
mr
biden's
notion
of
personal
space
does
not
accord
with
contemporary
standards
his
top
billing
today
probably
says
less
about
him
than
the
democrats
backward-looking
frame
of
mind
mr
biden
represents
a
lifeline
to
the
golden
days
of
the
obama
administration
the
biggest
cheers
in
burlington
came
when
he
mentioned
mr
obama
it
is
even
possible
to
read
his
book
of
real-life
grief
and
recovery
as
a
political
allegory
for
the
erasing
of
the
trump
blot
that
democrats
dream
of
the
fact
that
mr
biden's
strengths
his
conviviality
and
appeal
to
blue-collar
voters
map
mrs
clinton's
big
weaknesses
reinforces
the
sense
that
his
prominence
is
about
the
past
not
the
future
and
elections
are
the
other
way
round
there
is
more
than
mr
biden's
dignity
at
stake
in
this
the
tremendous
moral
courage
he
has
shown
in
circumstances
that
every
parent
dreads
should
resonate
far
beyond
politics
it
would
be
a
shame
to
see
it
reduced
to
a
footnote
in
a
fiercely
contested
primary
battle
that
he
seems
unlikely
to
win
that
would
also
be
a
waste
of
mr
biden's
potential
to
act
as
a
democratic
elder
statesman
unifying
the
party's
diverse
candidates
and
parts
meanwhile
his
prominence
in
the
primary
speculation
is
a
barrier
to
progress
that
is
most
obviously
because
the
left
has
fresher
potentially
better
working-class
champions
who
would
be
likelier
to
run
if
mr
biden
does
not
senator
sherrod
brown
of
ohio
is
one
more
broadly
it
is
unwise
to
think
that
mr
biden's
long-ago
working-class
roots
are
a
substitute
for
the
serious
reappraisal
of
economic
policy
that
the
trump
insurgency
makes
urgent
democrats
need
new
blood
they
also
need
new
ideas
the
admirable
mr
biden
offers
neither
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
