the
interminable
abortion
war
donald
trump
thinks
abortion
may
be
an
election-winner
the
democrats
might
even
prove
him
right
for
the
noisy
extremists
on
both
sides
of
america's
abortion
war
the
real
enemy
is
not
each
other
but
the
more
moderate
majority
in
between
them
despite
the
passions
the
issue
excites
on
the
margins
among
the
of
americans
who
think
abortion
should
be
legal
in
all
circumstances
and
the
who
want
it
banned
an
unyielding
majority
of
americans
take
a
more
nuanced
view
abortion
greys
as
they
are
sometimes
called
have
for
decades
thought
abortion
should
be
legal
they
are
strongly
against
repealing
roe
v
wade
the
supreme
court
ruling
that
recognised
abortion
as
a
constitutional
right
but
they
don't
like
the
grim
practice
suspect
it
is
wrong
and
want
it
to
be
restricted
especially
in
the
later
stages
of
pregnancy
hence
pro-lifers
have
seized
forcefully
upon
the
new
abortion
laws
recently
passed
in
new
york
and
drafted
in
virginia
which
would
make
it
easier
to
terminate
a
fetus
in
the
third
trimester
president
donald
trump
describes
the
laws
as
a
democratic
plot
to
allow
children
to
be
ripped
from
their
mother's
womb
right
up
until
the
moment
of
birth
such
rhetoric
has
traditionally
been
employed
by
anti-abortionists
along
with
pictures
of
dismembered
fetuses
and
threats
of
hellfire
as
an
argument
for
a
blanket
ban
yet
that
is
unimaginable
even
if
roe
were
overruled
by
the
new
conservative
majority
on
the
supreme
court
bench
around
states
run
by
democrats
or
moderate
republicans
would
carry
on
providing
abortions
regardless
indeed
the
new
york
and
virginia
initiatives
were
fuelled
in
part
by
a
desire
to
ensure
uninterrupted
abortion
services
in
those
states
in
the
event
that
roe
is
scrapped
the
more
limited
curb
on
late-term
abortions
mr
trump
says
he
wants
by
contrast
could
be
popular
polls
suggest
two
in
three
americans
who
consider
themselves
to
be
pro-choice
are
against
late-term
abortions
this
tactical
move
among
pro-lifers
is
part
of
a
recent
trend
and
broadly
welcome
trying
to
represent
the
view
of
the
majority
is
better
than
their
longtime
losing
battle
to
shift
public
opinion
to
the
extreme
but
it
is
notable
that
banning
late-term
abortion
would
have
little
impact
on
the
roughly
abortions
carried
out
in
america
each
year
only
about
take
place
after
weeks
and
they
are
often
a
response
to
the
sorts
of
exceptional
circumstances
including
threats
to
the
mother's
life
or
abnormalities
in
the
fetus
that
existing
state-level
bans
on
late-term
abortion
as
well
as
public
opinion
tend
to
allow
the
main
reason
mr
trump
is
harping
on
the
issue
is
political
in
a
tight
election
a
tiny
movement
of
well-placed
voters
can
be
decisive
and
the
voters
who
seem
likeliest
to
be
swayed
by
an
argument
against
late-term
abortions
are
likely
to
be
among
the
most
coveted
next
year
they
are
working-class
catholics
concentrated
in
the
midwestern
states
such
as
michigan
and
ohio
that
mr
trump
won
narrowly
in
hard-up
and
moderately
religious
they
tend
to
hold
socially
conservative
views
but
not
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
them
presented
with
an
uncompromising
democratic
champion
of
abortion
rights
pro-lifers
hope
they
might
be
persuaded
to
make
an
exception
to
that
and
with
the
democrats
veering
to
the
extreme
on
this
issue
among
others
that
is
possible
mr
trump's
emotive
language
as
many
have
noted
exaggerated
the
potential
effect
of
the
changes
in
new
york
and
virginia
hardly
any
abortions
are
or
would
be
carried
out
in
america
after
weeks
when
fetuses
are
considered
to
be
capable
of
feeling
pain
yet
such
nuance
is
equally
absent
from
the
way
leading
democrats
speak
about
abortion
according
to
senator
kirsten
gillibrand
a
hopeful
there
is
zero
place
for
politicians
to
be
involved
in
these
very
complicated
medical
decisions
the
obvious
lesson
which
pro-lifers
appear
at
least
temporarily
to
have
learned
is
that
politicians
willing
to
compromise
have
the
broadest
appeal
indeed
the
resistance
that
abortion
greys
have
shown
to
the
polemics
of
both
sides
over
three
decades
of
abortion
warring
is
impressive
some
liberals
anticipated
that
post-roe
americans
would
become
as
relaxed
about
abortion
rights
as
they
were
fast
becoming
about
civil
rights
gay
rights
and
other
liberal
matters
ruled
on
by
the
court
that
has
not
happened
in
part
because
of
the
abolitionists
but
also
because
of
factors
beyond
politicians
control
these
include
religious
faith
and
developments
in
medicine
which
have
made
fetuses
viable
at
an
earlier
stage
provided
more
graphic
pictures
of
their
emergence
and
made
even
difficult
pregnancies
less
daunting
such
progress
has
made
people
who
once
saw
abortion
primarily
as
a
medical
issue
or
in
the
case
of
formerly
pro-choice
republicans
as
a
social
welfare
and
fiscal
one
likelier
to
see
it
as
a
moral
one
in
which
the
mother
and
the
unborn
child
both
have
a
stake
yet
the
abortion
war
mainly
illustrates
how
far
from
moderation
politicians
have
nonetheless
been
pushed
first
on
the
right
but
increasingly
also
on
the
left
until
the
late
s
republicans
were
deeply
divided
on
the
issue
they
formed
a
unified
view
of
it
as
a
moral
crisis
only
after
the
party's
alignment
with
the
religious
right
the
endurance
of
that
position
even
as
the
abortion
rate
has
since
plunged
also
reflects
the
way
energetic
minorities
such
as
pro-lifers
have
been
able
to
control
internal
party
debate
through
the
primary
system
on
the
left
in
this
and
other
ways
the
extremist
drift
came
later
and
is
more
modest
yet
hillary
clinton's
gravitation
from
calling
abortion
sad
even
tragic
in
to
the
more
conventionally
pro-choice
line
she
espoused
in
was
a
significant
change
the
argument
over
late-term
abortions
is
worth
having
at
the
least
most
americans
seem
to
consider
it
important
and
necessary
but
the
abortion
war
looks
essentially
irresoluble
only
a
drastic
political
realignment
to
end
the
wider
culture
wars
it
has
done
so
much
to
inflame
could
terminate
it
as
a
barrier
to
more
productive
politics
the
resulting
deadlock
is
another
tragedy
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
