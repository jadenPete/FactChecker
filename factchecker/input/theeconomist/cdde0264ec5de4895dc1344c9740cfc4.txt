african-americans
are
the
democrats
most
loyal
constituency
they
are
now
at
the
centre
of
the
party's
strategy
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
base
voter
says
stacey
abrams
who
last
year
came
closer
than
any
democrat
this
century
to
becoming
georgia's
governor
ms
abrams
embraced
identity
politics
she
contributed
an
article
to
the
current
issue
of
foreign
affairs
entitled
identity
politics
strengthens
democracy
and
made
registration
and
mobilisation
of
young
and
non-white
voters
central
to
her
campaign
to
win
we
had
to
activate
voters
in
communities
that
had
been
discounted
because
they
were
seen
as
not
viable
republicans
didn't
worry
about
them
because
they
could
never
win
and
democrats
didn't
engage
because
they
didn't
vote
in
purely
strategic
terms
it
is
not
obvious
that
democrats
need
make
a
special
effort
to
court
black
voters
the
last
republican
to
win
a
majority
of
their
votes
was
herbert
hoover
in
no
american
ethnic
group
is
as
reliably
and
deeply
partisan
since
when
republicans
nominated
barry
goldwater
who
voted
against
that
year's
civil
rights
act
no
democratic
presidential
candidate
has
captured
less
than
of
the
black
vote
this
loyalty
leaves
many
african-americans
feeling
taken
for
granted
as
though
democrats
have
not
so
much
courted
their
votes
as
assumed
they
will
show
up
what
we've
seen
in
the
past
explains
dejuana
thompson
whose
group
woke
vote
helped
propel
doug
jones
to
victory
in
alabama's
senate
race
in
is
candidates
who
show
up
in
black
churches
two
weeks
before
election
day
expecting
parishioners
to
trust
vote
and
get
out
and
work
for
their
campaigns
for
free
things
are
different
as
the
democratic
party's
marathon
primary
gets
under
way
not
only
are
two
african-american
senators
cory
booker
and
kamala
harris
among
the
top
tier
of
democratic
candidates
both
they
and
their
rivals
have
discussed
racism
and
racial
inequities
openly
in
ways
that
previous
democratic
candidates
have
shied
away
from
the
democrats
directness
about
race
reflects
both
shifting
priorities
within
their
coalition
and
a
tactical
bet
on
how
to
best
mobilise
and
expand
their
base
as
recently
as
the
primaries
of
when
barack
obama
was
picking
up
delegates
thanks
to
his
strength
with
african-americans
and
white
progressives
hillary
clinton
was
appealing
to
hard-working
americans
white
americans
such
rhetoric
would
be
immediately
disqualifying
for
a
democrat
today
as
whites
without
a
college
degree
have
left
the
party
the
democratic
coalition
of
well-educated
whites
with
members
of
ethnic
minorities
has
grown
more
unified
around
questions
of
racism
in
just
of
democrats
agreed
with
the
statement
racial
discrimination
is
the
main
reason
why
black
people
can't
get
ahead
these
days
by
the
summer
of
that
share
had
risen
to
see
chart
rhetoric
from
the
party's
candidates
reflects
that
consensus
elizabeth
warren
mentioned
racial
wealth
gaps
in
the
first
minute
of
her
campaign
announcement
soon
after
kirsten
gillibrand
announced
she
acknowledged
systemic
institutional
and
daily
individual
acts
of
racism
and
decried
racial
income
gaps
as
did
ms
harris
in
her
announcement
speech
along
with
the
state
of
criminal
justice
and
police
killings
of
young
black
men
cory
booker
backs
baby
bonds
a
plan
to
give
each
child
at
birth
followed
by
annual
payments
tailored
to
family
wealth
until
the
child
turns
as
a
way
to
narrow
the
racial
wealth
gap
ms
harris
ms
warren
and
juli
n
castro
a
former
mayor
and
cabinet
secretary
also
seeking
the
nomination
have
all
endorsed
some
form
of
reparations
for
slavery
but
have
all
stopped
short
of
calling
for
direct
financial
transfers
some
might
consider
these
positions
pandering
but
as
leah
wright-rigueur
a
harvard
professor
who
wrote
the
loneliness
of
the
black
republican
notes
voters
might
ask
do
i
really
care
that
they're
pandering
maybe
i
want
to
be
pandered
to
republicans
pander
to
their
base
all
the
time
the
tactical
bet
that
lots
of
people
who
have
not
voted
before
can
be
led
to
the
polls
is
one
that
ms
abrams
and
andrew
gillum
made
in
their
governors
races
in
georgia
and
florida
respectively
according
to
this
theory
the
limited
time
and
energy
of
a
campaign
is
better
spent
mining
untapped
black
voters
than
trying
to
win
back
wavering
white
ones
some
fear
this
strategy
may
turn
off
white
voters
who
still
comprise
a
majority
of
the
electorate
after
all
both
ms
abrams
and
mr
gillum
lost
the
latter
in
a
swing
state
in
a
year
that
was
otherwise
favourable
to
democrats
that
suggests
the
bet
may
be
mistaken
it
may
also
be
a
category
error
when
it
comes
to
issues
black
democrats
are
not
very
different
from
democrats
of
other
hues
criminal-justice
reform
investing
in
public
education
and
expanding
access
to
health
care
all
have
particular
appeal
to
black
voters
who
bear
the
brunt
of
mass
incarceration
and
poor
schools
they
also
appeal
to
democratic
voters
of
all
stripes
ultimately
says
gilda
cobb-hunter
a
state
representative
from
south
carolina
black
democrats
are
looking
for
the
same
thing
as
every
other
democrat
in
the
past
it's
been
kind
of
like
a
beauty
contest
who's
speaking
to
your
heart
but
what
i'm
picking
up
now
is
a
real
sense
of
i
want
a
winner
and
the
winner
is
going
to
be
the
candidate
who
can
beat
that
candidate
need
not
be
black
to
win
black
votes
but
he
or
she
will
need
to
court
their
support
more
vigorously
than
in
past
cycles
that
is
not
only
an
acknowledgment
of
past
oversight
ms
abrams
argues
it
will
be
cost-efficient
these
communities
are
already
tilted
toward
the
value
system
and
policies
of
democrats
the
mission
isn't
to
get
someone
to
change
their
ideology
the
mission
is
to
get
them
to
act
on
their
beliefs
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
