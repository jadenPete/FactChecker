low
inflation
means
the
federal
reserve
is
changing
whom
it
listens
to
it
also
means
lower
interest
rates
heaven
help
anyone
who
complains
of
a
labour
shortage
to
neel
kashkari
president
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
minneapolis
we
just
don't
have
enough
people
to
build
said
the
head
of
an
affordable
housing
organisation
in
aberdeen
south
dakota
on
july
th
a
local
wind-turbine
maker
grumbled
about
his
struggles
to
expand
his
headcount
mr
kashkari
showed
little
sympathy
if
you
pay
more
they
will
come
he
says
mr
kashkari
has
been
sceptical
of
such
pleading
for
years
convinced
that
the
labour
market
could
be
hotter
his
doubts
appear
to
have
spread
when
testifying
to
congress
on
july
th
jerome
powell
the
fed's
chairman
said
that
while
we
hear
lots
of
reports
of
companies
having
a
hard
time
finding
qualified
labour
nonetheless
we
don't
see
wages
really
responding
it
may
seem
strange
that
anecdotes
would
matter
to
monetary
policymakers
given
the
swathes
of
statistics
at
their
disposal
but
the
fed
devotes
a
non-trivial
amount
of
energy
to
gathering
them
eight
times
a
year
they
are
compiled
in
a
publication
known
as
the
beige
book
based
on
interviews
with
business
folk
and
community
contacts
across
america
since
the
beige
book
has
been
released
two
weeks
before
each
meeting
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
fomc
the
gap
according
to
the
minneapolis
fed
was
supposed
to
send
the
message
that
the
information
was
not
timely
and
therefore
did
not
have
a
major
influence
on
policy
still
financial
analysts
pore
over
every
new
edition
anecdotes
from
the
beige
book
pepper
the
minutes
of
each
fomc
meeting
and
although
weathered
economists
will
say
that
data
and
models
determine
policy
the
stories
are
supposed
to
serve
as
reality
checks
for
years
the
beige
book
has
revealed
that
workers
are
neither
as
abundant
nor
as
cheap
as
employers
would
like
when
complaints
of
shortages
started
popping
up
in
it
in
they
were
laughable
the
unemployment
rate
was
then
above
but
they
became
more
plausible
as
unemployment
fell
and
when
theory
and
data
pointed
to
fears
that
a
burst
of
inflation
was
round
the
corner
gripes
from
business
owners
reinforced
the
view
that
a
rise
in
interest
rates
would
be
necessary
to
get
in
front
of
it
those
anecdotes
did
matter
says
tim
duy
of
the
university
of
oregon
adding
that
they
matter
less
now
this
is
because
the
inflation
that
was
supposed
to
arrive
in
never
did
as
unemployment
sank
below
wage
growth
remained
in
line
with
the
sum
of
inflation
and
productivity
growth
that
has
raised
doubts
about
whether
the
labour
market
is
as
hot
as
people
thought
on
july
th
mr
powell
quipped
that
to
call
something
hot
you
need
to
see
some
heat
signs
of
coolness
have
been
around
for
years
in
the
data
and
in
the
beige
book
in
september
contacts
in
new
england
reported
that
they
were
adapting
to
the
tight-supply
landscape
by
expanding
online
building
stronger
relationships
with
job-market
candidates
and
active
community
engagement
in
october
some
businesses
reported
non-wage
strategies
to
recruit
and
retain
workers
such
as
flexible
work
schedules
and
longer
holiday
time
if
employers
were
really
so
desperate
for
workers
mr
kashkari
has
argued
they
should
be
bidding
up
their
price
the
voices
found
in
the
beige
book
are
skewed
towards
businesses
who
will
tend
to
prefer
an
abundance
of
workers
and
resent
the
hassle
of
having
to
train
up
less-qualified
recruits
the
lack
of
excessive
wage
pressure
and
muted
inflation
have
allowed
a
new
set
of
stories
to
become
more
prominent
as
part
of
recent
listening
sessions
union
leaders
and
local
development
organisations
have
shared
their
tales
about
how
the
hot
economy
is
forcing
employers
to
pull
in
some
of
america's
most
marginalised
workers
in
a
speech
on
july
th
mr
powell
said
he
had
heard
loud
and
clear
about
the
benefits
of
the
long
recovery
for
low-
and
moderate-income
americans
previously
the
most
prominent
stories
supported
interest-rate
increases
the
newer
ones
highlight
the
risks
of
killing
off
the
expansion
if
inflation
were
rising
above
the
fed's
target
its
leadership
would
be
picking
different
tales
to
emphasise
and
if
as
investors
expect
the
fed
cuts
interest
rates
at
its
next
meeting
on
july
th
and
st
mr
powell
will
probably
cite
uncertainties
about
trade
and
global
growth
as
well
as
a
downward
drift
in
inflation
expectations
the
latest
beige
book
published
on
july
th
contains
plenty
to
support
him
but
if
mr
powell
wants
some
more
anecdotes
he
could
pick
them
up
from
the
rest
of
mr
kashkari's
trip
a
breakfast
to
discuss
substance
abuse
included
complaints
from
participants
that
despite
a
local
unemployment
rate
of
merely
employers
were
still
being
far
too
sniffy
about
hiring
ex-felons
they
can
stack
shelves
said
one
reproachfully
such
stories
might
mislead
and
they
can
easily
be
cherry-picked
but
at
the
moment
these
anecdotes
seem
to
be
carrying
more
weight
than
complaints
from
employers
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
