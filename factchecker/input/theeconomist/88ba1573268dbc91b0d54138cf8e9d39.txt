america
calls
time
on
the
inf
treaty
ushering
in
a
new
age
of
missiles
the
pact
signed
by
reagan
and
gorbachev
underpinned
bilateral
arms
control
for
years
patriot
park
in
kubinka
km
south-west
of
moscow
is
a
military
disneyland
families
can
picnic
among
rows
of
soviet-era
aircraft
children
can
frolic
over
tanks
those
doing
so
on
january
rd
might
have
noticed
a
long
green
tube
studded
with
ridges
and
dials
roped
off
and
watched
by
stern
guards
this
was
not
an
exhibit
it
was
supposedly
the
canister
for
the
m
missile
its
launcher
an
imposing
truck
stood
nearby
as
lieutenant-general
mikhail
matveyevsky
russia's
missile
chief
pointed
to
a
diagram
of
the
missile's
innards
all
tests
of
surface-to-surface
missiles
he
declared
were
conducted
to
a
range
that
is
less
than
the
inf
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
limit
the
show-and-tell
did
not
impress
america
whose
diplomats
had
turned
down
an
invitation
to
the
theme
park
on
february
st
america
declared
it
would
pull
out
of
the
inf
treaty
it
is
exasperated
not
only
with
ten
years
of
russian
cheating
but
also
with
the
rapid
growth
in
china's
unshackled
arsenal
of
over
missiles
of
which
are
of
the
range
forbidden
to
america
if
russia's
doing
it
and
if
china's
doing
it
and
we're
adhering
to
the
agreement
complained
donald
trump
in
october
that's
unacceptable
the
pact
will
die
once
america's
six
months
notice
expires
in
the
summer
the
likelihood
of
compromise
is
zero
says
adam
thomson
britain's
envoy
to
nato
until
that
brings
over
years
of
arms
control
to
a
close
the
inf
treaty
was
forged
in
to
defuse
a
missile
race
between
america
and
the
soviet
union
intermediate-range
nukes
were
appealing
because
they
could
hit
key
targets
while
remaining
a
safe
distance
away
from
the
front
line
without
resorting
to
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles
icbms
appealing
but
dangerous
icbms
took
minutes
to
reach
their
targets
mid-range
missiles
got
there
in
under
ten
it
was
like
holding
a
gun
to
our
head
remarked
mikhail
gorbachev
he
and
ronald
reagan
agreed
to
scrap
all
such
land-based
missiles
conventional
and
nuclear
by
the
s
the
treaty
began
to
chafe
russia
its
decrepit
armed
forces
could
not
afford
modern
warships
submarines
and
warplanes
to
carry
plentiful
missiles
whose
utility
america
had
demonstrated
with
bombing
campaigns
in
the
middle
east
and
the
balkans
to
russia's
south
and
east
countries
like
israel
iran
china
and
pakistan
were
accumulating
land-based
missiles
in
russia's
defence
minister
proposed
that
the
treaty
should
be
junked
not
long
after
came
russia's
first
test
of
the
m
since
four
battalions
roughly
missiles
have
been
deployed
to
two
bases
east
of
the
ural
mountains
and
near
the
caspian
sea
the
m
is
core
to
russian
military
thinking
in
terms
of
what
they
need
to
fight
a
regional
war
says
pranay
vaddi
who
worked
on
the
issue
for
the
state
department
until
october
american
officials
may
decry
the
cheating
but
they
surely
sympathise
with
the
impulse
in
recent
years
pentagon
officials
have
fretted
over
a
widening
missile
gap
in
the
pacific
china
has
a
massive
advantage
over
us
says
a
former
american
army
official
it
cannot
be
overstated
how
important
it
is
that
we
can
field
precision-guided
missiles
unlimited
by
range
the
inf
treaty
does
not
prohibit
putting
intermediate-range
missiles
on
ships
submarines
and
aircraft
but
these
are
expensive
a
modern
destroyer
costs
bn
demand
manpower
and
have
other
things
to
do
hence
the
appeal
of
land-based
missiles
a
mobile
tel
requires
a
couple
of
drivers
and
operators
says
the
former
official
referring
to
the
transporter-erector-launcher
trucks
used
to
fire
missiles
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
find
in
a
review
of
american
nuclear
posture
last
year
the
trump
administration
said
it
would
respond
to
russia's
violation
of
the
inf
treaty
by
building
a
nuclear-tipped
sea-launched
cruise
missile
which
would
be
inf-compliant
and
reviewing
concepts
and
options
for
a
conventional
land-based
one
which
would
not
be
but
a
deployable
weapon
is
some
way
off
the
us
army
is
already
working
on
a
precision
strike
missile
prsm
due
in
its
range
could
easily
be
extended
beyond
the
current
inf
ceiling
of
km
but
even
twice
that
would
not
get
from
warsaw
to
moscow
a
longer-legged
option
would
be
to
tweak
the
sea-based
tomahawk
to
fire
from
land
that
is
what
america
did
during
the
inf
crisis
in
the
s
to
produce
the
km-range
gryphon
but
pacific
geography
is
forbidding
guam
the
likeliest
host
for
american
missiles
in
asia
if
japan
demurs
is
over
km
away
from
shanghai
an
entirely
new
missile
would
be
required
hypersonic
boost-glide
missiles
which
skip
off
the
atmosphere
at
great
speed
might
fit
the
bill
but
ground-launched
ones
are
years
away
democrats
who
took
control
of
the
house
in
january
have
taken
a
dim
view
of
the
swelling
defence
budget
they
may
query
why
the
pentagon
cannot
make
do
with
air-
and
sea-launched
systems
already
in
the
pipeline
nor
is
it
obvious
where
new
missiles
would
be
put
in
europe
though
nato
strongly
backed
america
on
february
st
declaring
that
russia
will
bear
sole
responsibility
for
the
end
of
the
treaty
its
members
will
be
less
keen
on
welcoming
missiles
even
non-nuclear
ones
a
few
allies
like
poland
which
is
trying
to
seduce
mr
trump
into
setting
up
a
new
tank
base
would
probably
embrace
american
arms
on
their
soil
but
a
deal
with
poland
struck
over
nato's
head
would
compound
anxiety
over
america's
commitment
to
the
alliance
it
might
also
be
seen
as
destabilising
missiles
deployed
on
the
territory
of
newer
nato
members
could
reach
russia's
main
command
points
in
less
than
five
minutes
notes
pavel
zolotarev
of
the
russian
academy
of
sciences
that
he
warns
would
allow
the
destruction
of
its
critical
infrastructure
without
the
use
of
nuclear
warheads
in
a
crisis
a
jittery
russia
would
not
necessarily
make
wise
choices
another
option
for
nato
would
be
to
rejig
the
american-led
missile-defence
shield
in
poland
and
romania
so
that
it
could
cope
with
russian
cruise
missiles
like
the
m
rather
than
just
iranian
and
north
korean
ballistic
ones
yet
that
might
provoke
an
even
bigger
fight
in
nato
the
death
of
the
inf
treaty
marks
the
end
of
the
post-cold
war
era
says
bruno
tertrais
of
the
foundation
for
strategic
research
a
french
think-tank
what
is
clear
is
that
the
trump
administration
has
pulled
the
plug
without
a
clear
sense
of
how
to
navigate
the
era
to
come
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
