was
sentenced
to
years-to-life
in
a
new
york
prison
for
murder
attempted
robbery
and
assault
in
february
this
year
he
was
let
out
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
the
local
government
that
had
put
him
away
years
ago
his
conviction
was
overturned
after
the
brooklyn
district
attorney's
conviction
review
unit
cru
found
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
in
part
because
not
all
of
the
detectives
notes
had
been
shared
with
the
defence
mr
arroyo
was
the
th
person
to
have
his
conviction
quashed
by
brooklyn's

the
unit
which
until
then
had
only
investigated
troublesome
convictions

an
ad-hoc
basis
its
first
task
was
to
investigate
potentially
wrongful
convictions
in
cases
mostly
related
to
a
particular
disgraced
detective
the
unit
the
largest
in
the
country
has
since
become
a
model
for
other
jurisdictions
with
a
budget

steps
tracks
down
witnesses
including
those
in
other
states
or
behind
bars
and
sorts
through
mounds
of
evidence

lawyers
are
assigned
to
the

brooklyn's

a
page
report
detailing
all
the
missteps
and
problems

spells
out
lessons

overturning
wrongful
convictions
has
changed
the
da's
office
procedures
and
training
an
exoneration
makes
everyone
stop
and
pay
attention
and
learn
lessons
says
mr
gonzalez
most
of
the
overturned
convictions
have
been
for
murders
but
burglaries
and
rape
convictions
have
also
been
rubbed
out
mr
gonzalez
says
that
his

obligation
as
