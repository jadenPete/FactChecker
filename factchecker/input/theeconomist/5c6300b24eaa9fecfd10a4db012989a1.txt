trumped
by
the
taliban
donald
trump
has
created
an
opportunity
for
peace
that
he
looks
singularly
unable
to
capitalise
on
afghans
often
celebrate
auspicious
events
with
volleys
of
gunfire
the
taliban
went
one
further
on
september
nd
by
detonating
a
suicide-bomb
in
kabul
just
as
an
american
diplomat
zalmay
khalilzad
was
confirming
the
outline
of
the
draft
settlement
he
has
negotiated
with
the
jihadist
group
up
to
people
were
reported
killed
in
the
blast
half
a
dozen
more
were
shot
and
wounded
by
police
in
the
protests
that
followed
the
violence
underlined
why
the
draft
agreement
which
would
cover
an
initial
withdrawal
of
around
of
america's
troops
in
afghanistan
within
five
months
has
been
cautiously
welcomed
by
many
sceptics
the
taliban
control
much
of
the
country
cannot
be
defeated
and
the
war's
toll
on
afghans
is
intolerable
it
also
indicated
how
much
america
years
after
it
bombed
the
jihadists
from
power
has
capitulated
to
them
mr
khalilzad
a
former
ambassador
to
afghanistan
set
three
conditions
when
launching
peace
talks
with
the
militants
in
doha
a
year
ago
america
would
consider
withdrawing
only
if
they
agreed
to
a
ceasefire
recognised
afghanistan's
government
as
a
negotiating
partner
and
renounced
their
former
alliance
with
al-qaeda
this
offer
was
itself
a
significant
climb-down
under
george
w.
bush
america
refused
to
negotiate
with
the
taliban
under
barack
obama
it
started
to
but
stopped
after
afghanistan's
government
at
whose
behest
america
claims
to
be
operating
objected
donald
trump's
decision
to
revive
the
talks
over
president
ashraf
ghani's
more
vociferous
protests
was
therefore
a
big
concession
to
the
militants
even
if
justified
by
their
strength
yet
mr
khalilzad
seems
to
have
won
little
by
this
gamble
though
he
has
released
few
details
of
the
draft
agreement
he
appears
to
have
dropped
all
but
his
third
condition
the
taliban
have
agreed
to
participate
in
an
intra-afghan
dialogue
while
the
americans
draw
down
but
have
not
recognised
the
government
which
has
been
excluded
from
the
talks
last
weekend
mr
khalilzad
let
mr
ghani
read
a
copy
of
the
draft
provided
he
hand
it
back
afterwards
as
the
slaughter
in
kabul
indicates
the
militants
have
also
refused
to
countenance
a
ceasefire
or
discuss
a
more
lasting
settlement
beyond
maintaining
their
commitment
to
re-establishing
an
islamist
regime
they
have
not
indicated
what
power-sharing
or
constitutional
arrangement
they
might
be
willing
to
accept
short
of
total
victory
that
raises
obvious
concerns
about
their
commitment
to
peace
without
which
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
their
anticipated
promise
to
cut
their
cord
to
foreign
terrorists
could
be
verified
especially
in
the
absence
of
american
troops
this
is
dispiriting
but
not
surprising
as
the
war
has
dragged
on
the
american
government's
leverage
over
the
taliban
has
been
eroded
by
its
floundering
and
their
success
according
to
ronald
e.
neumann
a
former
ambassador
to
kabul
america
has
undertaken
nine
major
policy
shifts
in
afghanistan
or
three
per
sitting
president
since
launching
the
war
mr
bush
was
against
nation-building
then
for
it
mr
obama
ramped
up
the
war
then
ended
it
mr
trump
lambasted
the
war
for
years
seemed
momentarily
energised
by
the
prospect
of
succeeding
where
his
predecessor
failed
and
now
aching
for
a
foreign-policy
win
may
simply
want
the
troops
out
before
next
year's
election
no
wonder
the
taliban's
leaders
at
the
helm
of
a
profitable
insurgency
and
confident
of
victory
sooner
or
later
are
not
minded
to
compromise
to
stand
a
fair
chance
of
arresting
afghanistan's
descent
to
civil
war
america
will
have
to
persuade
the
militants
it
has
more
sticking-power
than
they
think
mr
khalilzad
implies
it
is
willing
to
he
maintains
the
withdrawal
will
be
conditions-based
which
suggests
it
could
go
into
reverse
if
the
taliban
do
not
get
more
enthusiastic
about
peacemaking
and
indeed
mr
trump
has
better
cards
than
the
militants
may
imagine
with
another
western
troops
in
afghanistan
the
alliances
that
sustain
america's
effort
look
solid
neighbouring
pakistan
and
china
helped
push
the
militants
to
the
table
and
america's
current
level
of
commitment
to
afghanistan
appears
sustainable
congress
and
the
media
generally
ignore
the
conflict
there
are
two
problems
with
this
somewhat
hopeful
case
mr
trump
may
prefer
to
fold
his
supporters
want
an
end
to
america's
wars
almost
as
much
as
a
border
wall
and
having
failed
to
wall
off
mexico
he
may
consider
the
former
campaign
promise
easier
to
keep
that
would
be
consistent
with
an
emerging
paradox
of
his
presidency
his
unorthodoxy
has
consistently
created
novel
opportunities
a
possible
splurge
on
infrastructure
at
home
a
peace
process
with
the
taliban
abroad
that
his
personal
shortcomings
make
him
especially
unlikely
to
realise
more
fundamentally
ushering
the
taliban
and
government
to
the
table
and
keeping
them
there
would
require
a
degree
of
political
nous
and
flexibility
that
america
lacks
above
all
else
in
afghanistan
its
efforts
have
been
disjointed
with
soldiers
diplomats
and
spies
pushing
conflicting
priorities
that
only
the
faraway
president
can
adjudicate
between
hence
the
policy
shifts
as
mr
bush
and
his
successors
flitted
from
one
recommendation
to
the
next
often
in
response
to
domestic
pressures
the
complex
politics
of
a
country
torn
by
war
and
ethnic
rivalry
and
between
modernity
and
tradition
have
rarely
penetrated
that
self-absorbed
process
the
limited
understanding
of
american
political
officers
cycled
in
every
six
months
or
so
has
made
matters
worse
mr
neumann
recalls
his
unsuccessful
effort
to
persuade
mr
ghani's
predecessor
to
sack
a
provincial
governor
convicted
of
selling
heroin
in
america
it
was
months
before
the
then
ambassador
learned
that
the
president
owed
a
big
favour
to
the
drug-pusher's
father
remember
that
next
time
you
hear
politicians
cudgelling
each
other
with
arguments
for
and
against
state-building
there
is
little
recent
evidence
that
america
is
capable
of
it
even
the
more
modest
task
of
saving
afghanistan's
current
shaky
structure
may
be
beyond
it
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
