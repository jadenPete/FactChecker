what
rahm
emanuel
has
done
for
chicago
his
global
city
still
has
deep-seated
fiscal
and
social
problems
rahm
emanuel
is
restless
he
swallows
an
indigestion
tablet
buttons
a
blue
cardigan
then
paces
his
office
on
the
fifth
floor
of
city
hall
on
february
th
voters
will
choose
between
candidates
vying
to
replace
him
as
mayor
of
chicago
how
does
he
think
his
two
terms
will
be
remembered
predecessors
let
problems
fester
he
says
but
there
wasn't
a
single
challenge
we
didn't
attack
city
debt
a
lack
of
corporate
investment
rotten
schools
violence
racial
segregation
corruption
all
have
long
blighted
america's
third-biggest
city
but
we
never
walked
away
he
says
take
his
boasts
with
a
pinch
of
salt
when
pressed
on
chicago's
large
lingering
fiscal
problems
he
is
scornful
slaps
your
correspondent's
knee
then
adds
a
sharp
kick
to
his
foot
nobody
in
public
life
solves
anything
they
improve
it
if
you're
here
to
solve
it
call
me
he
says
mr
emanuel
shrank
the
city's
structural
deficit
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
by
cutting
spending
and
increasing
taxes
he
has
also
been
prone
to
raising
new
debt
to
pay
off
old
a
bad
habit
known
locally
as
scoop
and
toss
but
chicago's
finances
never
deteriorated
as
much
as
say
detroit's
because
the
city's
economic
engine
kept
whirring
david
axelrod
an
ally
from
when
both
men
worked
for
barack
obama
praises
the
mayor
as
energetic
like
a
heat-seeking
missile
he
is
a
brilliant
guy
for
all
his
quirks
he
says
in
particular
mr
axelrod
admires
him
for
tackling
the
city's
enormous
fiscal
problems
credit-rating
agencies
have
grown
more
optimistic
about
chicago
after
listing
its
bonds
as
junk
but
the
city's
long-term
fiscal
health
is
still
doubtful
ed
bachrach
co-author
of
a
new
book
on
chicago
says
overall
city
debt
rose
from
bn
to
bn
in
seven
years
to
worse
is
a
colossal
unfunded
liability
of
some
bn
for
pensions
of
city
workers
even
mr
emanuel
admits
he
only
stopped
the
bleeding
the
wider
economy
is
doing
well
though
the
city
can
seem
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
chicagoland
as
the
cluster
of
suburban
cities
around
chicago
is
known
disputes
occasionally
flare
as
when
chicago
politicians
talk
of
expanding
city
limits
around
o'hare
airport
some
mayors
strive
to
co-operate
with
their
suburban
neighbours
to
get
things
done
john
hickenlooper
who
ran
denver
between
and
was
a
good
example
mr
emanuel
has
preferred
distant
horizons
branding
his
as
a
global
city
a
two-decade-old
chicagoland
mayors
caucus
does
little
at
least
chicago's
m
population
is
stable
after
decades
of
decline
its
jobless
rate
is
just
and
poverty
is
falling
last
year
nearly
m
tourists
came
for
theatre
comedy
sports
and
museums
new
walking
and
cycle
tracks
have
been
built
by
the
river
and
lake
by
one
measure
o'hare
again
claims
to
be
america's
busiest
airport
it
is
set
for
a
bn
expansion
mr
emanuel
prodded
firms
such
as
mcdonald's
to
bring
their
headquarters
to
chicago
the
metropolis
draws
more
foreign
direct
investment
projects
than
any
in
america
and
is
behind
only
london
paris
singapore
and
amsterdam
worldwide
manufacturing
which
still
employs
of
workers
is
surprisingly
strong
ford
announced
on
february
th
that
it
would
add
jobs
to
a
factory
in
the
city
chicago's
school
system
used
to
be
a
national
joke
it
was
long
dominated
by
intransigent
teachers
unions
and
almost
went
bust
at
last
that
is
changing
longer
school
days
shorter
holidays
and
the
belated
introduction
of
universal
pre-school
mean
that
children
spend
more
time
studying
mr
emanuel
claims
the
average
child
will
gain
the
equivalent
of
an
extra
four
years
in
school
as
a
result
the
mayor
also
closed
underused
schools
in
poor
depopulating
neighbourhoods
he
is
defensive
about
that
admitting
it
was
tough
on
them
on
families
on
me
politically
black
residents
almost
the
only
ones
affected
turned
on
him
mr
axelrod
says
he
should
have
found
a
way
to
soften
the
blow
in
already
suffering
districts
but
the
decision
made
sense
given
a
financially
strained
school
system
with
capacity
for
but
only
children
enrolled
as
important
head
teachers
got
more
autonomy
and
added
courses
for
high
achievers
children
are
enrolled
in
international
baccalaureate
programmes
results
are
improving
more
pupils
finish
a
pitiful
graduated
seven
years
ago
whereas
do
so
now
the
head
of
city
schools
janice
jackson
says
that
for
the
first
time
there
is
a
comprehensive
push
to
get
everyone
to
complete
high
school
if
mr
emanuel
thinks
everything
has
gone
so
well
why
did
he
back
out
of
his
well-funded
bid
for
a
third
term
last
september
he
says
he
was
dissuaded
by
seeing
polls
that
indicated
he
could
win
had
they
indicated
the
opposite
the
ultra-competitive
politician
claims
he
would
have
relished
the
challenge
because
that's
the
weird
psychology
of
a
middle
jewish
kid
instead
the
year-old
will
write
a
book
earn
money
somewhere
and
plot
an
eventual
return
to
public
life
more
probably
he
knew
he
faced
a
brutal
campaign
in
he
was
only
narrowly
re-elected
black
voters
one-third
of
the
electorate
used
to
support
him
but
many
resent
the
school
closures
and
the
persistence
of
violence
and
poverty
in
their
districts
chicago
has
failed
to
match
the
success
of
new
york
and
los
angeles
in
cutting
murder
rates
sharply
see
chart
the
police
chief
eddie
johnson
praises
a
surge
of
new
officers
and
other
efforts
like
the
becoming
a
man
programme
to
deter
school
pupils
from
being
drawn
into
gangs
but
many
think
the
mayor
has
failed
badly
on
crime
mr
emanuel
is
scorned
especially
for
a
delay
in
the
release
of
police
footage
of
a
policeman
shooting
laquan
mcdonald
a
black
teenager
times
in
after
the
video
at
last
emerged
in
november
violence
soared
and
mr
emanuel's
chances
of
re-election
slumped
the
policeman
involved
was
recently
found
guilty
the
first
murder
conviction
of
a
serving
officer
in
decades
that
trial
under
way
as
the
campaign
began
would
have
overwhelmed
mr
emanuel's
message
the
mayor
said
he
would
not
run
the
day
before
it
started
what
are
chicago's
prospects
after
him
mayors
usually
are
larger
than
life
and
embody
the
energy
of
a
mighty
urban
centre
says
mr
axelrod
that
hardly
seems
true
of
the
people
competing
to
succeed
mr
emanuel
only
bill
daley
a
stolid
man
who
is
the
son
and
brother
of
two
other
long-serving
mayors
might
be
recognised
outside
the
windy
city
he
is
backed
by
rich
donors
who
hope
he
will
extend
chicago's
economic
recovery
he
might
manage
that
but
he's
no
missile
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
