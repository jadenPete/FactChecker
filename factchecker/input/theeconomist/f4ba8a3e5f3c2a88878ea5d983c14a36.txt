simulators
teach
police
and
their
critics
when
to
shoot
our
correspondent
tried
one
out
with
disastrous
consequences
you
are
years
old
fresh
out
of
the
academy
and
eager
to
protect
and
serve
out
on
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
quiet
weekday-afternoon
patrol
you
pass
a
red
pickup
truck
which
your
partner
recognises
it
belongs
to
a
guy
with
a
couple
of
outstanding
arrest
warrants
you
pull
him
over
your
partner
gets
out
of
the
car
and
tells
the
guy
he
has
to
bring
him
in
the
guy
promises
to
come
in
later
this
afternoon
after
he
drops
off
his
daughter
who
is
in
the
truck
at
her
mother's
house
your
partner
refuses
he's
heard
it
before
the
guy
gets
agitated
suddenly
the
door
of
the
truck
opens
and
a
girl
maybe
or
years
old
starts
shouting
at
your
partner
for
taking
her
daddy
she
steps
out
of
the
truck
pointing
her
father's
hunting
rifle
at
your
partner
what
do
you
do
that
is
just
one
of
the
roughly
scenarios
on
the
fats
firearms
training
simulator
an
interactive
machine
designed
says
raul
hernandez
a
detective
who
puts
nearly
newark
officers
through
their
paces
on
the
fats
twice
a
year
to
train
our
officers
to
survive
an
encounter
with
a
person
with
a
weapon
around
agencies
in
america
and
hundreds
more
around
the
world
including
the
canadian
and
singaporean
armies
and
the
british
ministry
of
defence
use
these
machines
the
training
is
like
a
high-end
video
game
holding
a
gun
loaded
with
compressed
air
rather
than
bullets
trainees
face
a
bank
of
screens
as
the
scenarios
unfold
a
mentally
ill
man
shouts
threats
while
holding
a
weapon
outside
an
apartment
building
a
teenaged
girl
menaces
a
boy
with
a
knife
there
is
a
live
shooter
in
a
hospital
trainers
can
change
the
scenario
as
trainees
respond
the
weapon
held
by
the
mentally
ill
man
might
turn
out
to
be
a
hairbrush
sometimes
the
right
response
is
a
verbal
one
the
teenaged
girl
can
put
down
the
knife
if
ordered
repeatedly
and
firmly
to
drop
it
the
machine
teaches
police
when
to
pull
the
trigger
and
when
to
hold
off
but
it
also
shows
citizens
just
how
quickly
police
have
to
make
life-and-death
decisions
mr
hernandez
says
that
some
activists
and
critics
of
the
police
have
been
put
through
their
paces
on
the
machines
and
come
out
saying
i
didn't
realise
what
a
hard
job
you
have
an
officer
from
a
different
department
noted
wryly
that
citizens
let
loose
on
the
simulator
shoot
everybody
not
quite
your
correspondent
the
father
of
an
year-old
got
his
partner
killed
because
he
could
not
shoot
the
girl
with
the
rifle
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
