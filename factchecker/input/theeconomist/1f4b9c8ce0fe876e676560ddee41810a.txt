william
barr
executive
assistant
to
donald
trump
the
benefits
of
an
attorney-general
with
a
capacious
view
of
presidential
authority
many
democrats
are
dismayed
by
robert
mueller's
failure
to
take
down
the
president
yet
they
have
a
consolatory
new
hate
figure
in
the
form
of
william
barr
who
began
his
second
spell
as
attorney-general
last
month
a
grandfatherly
year-old
who
first
presided
over
the
justice
department
for
george
h.w.
bush
mr
barr
has
been
castigated
for
his
handling
of
mr
mueller's
report
which
remains
under
wraps
at
his
discretion
jerrold
nadler
democratic
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
called
his
summary
of
the
report
a
hasty
partisan
interpretation
of
the
facts
several
democrats
running
for
president
including
kamala
harris
and
elizabeth
warren
derided
mr
barr
as
donald
trump's
hand-picked
attorney-general
as
if
there
were
any
other
kind
this
is
partly
a
case
of
shooting
the
messenger
many
on
the
left
were
convinced
mr
trump
was
up
to
his
neck
in
the
russian
plot
that
helped
get
him
elected
they
also
had
an
almost
cultlike
faith
in
mr
mueller
the
ash-dry
prosecutor
would
be
amazed
to
see
how
many
t-shirts
bear
his
name
on
campus
as
in
mueller
time
justice
served
cold
the
instant
mr
barr
relayed
the
crushing
news
that
the
special
counsel
had
found
no
collusion
with
russia
by
mr
trump
he
was
suspected
of
skulduggery
which
seems
hysterical
a
close
friend
of
the
special
counsel
mr
barr
is
possibly
too
principled
and
certainly
too
canny
to
have
misrepresented
his
conclusions
if
he
had
done
so
they
would
leak
yet
the
attorney-general's
treatment
of
the
second
prong
of
mr
mueller's
investigation
concerning
mr
trump's
alleged
effort
to
obstruct
the
various
russia
investigations
is
more
troubling
it
is
not
clear
why
mr
mueller
refrained
from
ruling
on
the
evidence
against
mr
trump
on
this
issue
it
is
also
unclear
whether
he
expected
mr
barr
to
rule
for
him
perhaps
mr
mueller
felt
the
decision
was
above
his
paygrade
given
the
justice
department's
policy
of
not
indicting
a
sitting
president
perhaps
mr
barr
and
his
deputy
rod
rosenstein
who
supported
his
view
that
mr
mueller
had
not
made
a
convincing
obstruction
case
made
a
straightforward
decision
yet
that
would
make
the
emphasis
mr
mueller
laid
upon
the
possibility
of
mr
trump's
guilt
in
stressing
that
his
report
did
not
exonerate
the
president
even
odder
than
it
already
seems
the
result
absent
further
disclosure
to
provide
explanation
and
reassurance
is
just
the
sort
of
heaving
political
mess
of
intrigue
and
innuendo
mr
mueller
was
appointed
to
clear
up
whatever
they
intended
he
and
mr
barr
have
combined
to
damage
mr
trump
while
clearing
him
theirs
is
a
jumbled
two-handed
version
of
james
comey's
fateful
decision
to
criticise
hillary
clinton's
email
arrangements
even
as
he
announced
that
she
would
not
faces
charges
no
wonder
it
has
elicited
the
same
partisan
response
republicans
consider
mr
trump
exonerated
democrats
almost
as
understandably
think
he
hasn't
been
that
is
not
to
imply
mr
mueller
considered
mr
trump
guilty
of
obstruction
it
will
take
a
fuller
disclosure
of
his
report
to
grasp
how
difficult
he
considered
the
factual
and
legal
impediments
to
that
conclusion
to
be
but
it
at
least
seems
likely
that
he
wanted
his
starkly
worded
equivocation
on
this
issue
which
mr
barr
had
little
option
but
to
relay
to
be
heard
by
congress
which
is
the
only
body
empowered
to
hold
mr
trump
to
account
given
that
the
justice
department
will
not
that
makes
mr
barr's
final
ruling
appear
unnecessary
indeed
paul
rosenzweig
and
others
on
the
lawfareblog
can
find
no
legal
or
departmental
explanation
for
it
that
alone
risks
mr
barr's
intervention
seeming
partial
at
least
to
the
half
of
america
aching
to
see
mr
trump
in
irons
and
the
impression
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
mr
barr
prejudged
the
mueller
investigation
in
the
president's
favour
before
he
took
charge
of
it
in
an
unsolicited
page
memo
to
mr
rosenstein
last
year
mr
barr
argued
that
the
special
counsel's
obstruction
probe
was
fatally
misconceived
and
premised
on
a
novel
and
legally
insupportable
reading
of
the
law
barr
boosters
argue
that
one
of
his
strengths
as
a
member
of
mr
trump's
cabinet
is
that
he
is
too
old
successful
and
phlegmatic
to
be
pushed
around
his
memo
which
was
distributed
to
the
white
house
suggests
he
was
a
bit
more
eager
to
get
back
in
the
game
than
that
portrayal
has
it
this
is
a
salutary
lesson
especially
for
those
who
look
to
the
law
to
settle
political
disputes
democrats
and
many
republicans
too
were
not
wrong
to
contrast
mr
mueller's
integrity
with
the
president's
lack
of
it
yet
the
special
counsel
was
never
likely
to
be
the
antidote
they
craved
because
the
power
of
the
ballot
trumps
the
law
and
because
the
law
is
slippery
mr
trump
employs
alternative
facts
on
the
question
of
obstruction
mr
mueller's
report
appears
to
offer
alternative
realities
the
episode
also
underscores
concerns
about
mr
barr's
expansive
view
of
executive
power
in
his
memo
he
argued
that
the
president
could
not
obstruct
justice
however
malign
his
motives
for
a
given
action
in
the
lawful
performance
of
his
office
in
summarising
the
mueller
report
he
offered
a
less
radical
argument
that
mr
trump
could
not
have
obstructed
justice
because
he
did
not
collude
with
russia
yet
this
seemed
so
obviously
threadbare
given
the
many
russia-related
things
mr
trump
had
to
hide
short
of
a
grand
conspiracy
that
it
suggested
the
extent
to
which
he
remains
fundamentally
guided
by
extreme
deference
to
presidential
authority
it
is
a
view
formed
in
the
s
when
conservatives
considered
the
presidency
the
best
means
to
undo
the
government
expansion
of
recent
years
almost
four
decades
later
the
power
of
the
executive
has
soared
and
the
ability
of
lawmakers
to
hold
it
to
account
is
at
rock-bottom
to
the
extent
that
mr
trump
has
conducted
a
two-year
war
on
the
justice
department
which
most
republican
congressmen
dare
not
acknowledge
and
yet
mr
barr's
legal
and
political
priorities
are
unchanged
which
is
of
course
why
mr
trump
picked
him
for
his
job
if
dogged
consistency
is
the
great
virtue
of
elder
statesmen
in
changing
times
it
is
also
their
weakness
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
