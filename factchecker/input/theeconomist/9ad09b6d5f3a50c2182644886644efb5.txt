mobilised
before
christmas
in
amazon's
new
state-of-the-art
warehouse
in
staten

workers
launched
a
campaign
to
unionise
their
main
grievances
are
safety
pay
and
hour
shifts
with
insufficient
breaks
as
well
as
punishing
hourly
quotas
amazon
says
it
pays
its
workers
in
staten
island
an
hour
which
is
more
than
other
local
warehouses
as
well
as
providing
health
care
offering
workers
further
education

up
to
weeks
of
parental

activists
pushed
state
government
to
enforce
a
code
of
conduct
at
big
retailers
which
includes
the
right
to
unionise
will
workers
activism
lead
to
unionisation
at
the
country's
second-biggest
private
employer
if
past
experiences
at
walmart
the
world's
largest
retailer
that
is
america's
biggest
private
employer
is
anything
to
go
by
the
answer
is
no
walmart
fought
attempts
by
workers
to
form
a
union
as
soon
as
top
management
heard
rumblings
about
unionisation
through
a
hotline
that
local
managers
were
directed
to
call
the
retail
behemoth
sent
a
labour
team
from
its
headquarters
in
bentonville
arkansas
to
the
uppity
shop
writes
rick
wartzman
a
former
head
of
the
drucker
institute
a
researcher
of
corporate
management
the
team
took
over
the
shop's
management
and
showed
workers
a
steady
stream
of
strident
anti-union
videos
and
other
propaganda
if
these
efforts
failed
it
simply
closed
the
shop
amazon
learned
from
walmart
as
did
many
other
big
firms
and
is
likely
to
be
as
effective
as
the
bentonville
behemoth
in
influencing
its
workers
thinking
even
so
warehouse
workers
have
a
lot
of
latent
power
argues
brishen
rogers
of
temple
university
thousands
of
them
work
together
at
one
giant
site
where
they
can
easily
communicate
compared
with
say
janitors
who
work
in
isolation
warehouses
are
at
the
centre
of
amazon's
operation
and
they
are
hugely
expensive
to
build
so
management
cannot
simply
shut
down
a
warehouse
it
takes
weeks
to
train
top-notch
warehouse
workers
to
operate
the
technology
they
use
so
staff
cannot
be
replaced
from
one
day
to
another
unionisation
typically
succeeds
when
a
company
does
a
poor
job
in
addressing
grievances
of
workers
argues
paul
osterman
at
mit
amazon
reacted
quickly
after
bernie
sanders
a
senator
from
vermont
introduced
the
stop
bezos
act
which
would
have
required
amazon
and
walmart
to
pay
the
government
for
food
stamps
medicaid
public
housing
and
other
federal
assistance
received
by
their
workers
a
few
weeks
later
amazon
announced
it
would
increase
the
minimum
wage
for
all
its
workers
in
america
to
an
hour
amazon
cares
about
its
reputation
as
a
progressive
company
based
in
liberal
seattle
this
is
a
vulnerability
but
also
a
strength
the
company
is
likely
to
listen
more
to
its
workers
than
big
retailers
did
in
the
past
discouraging
anaemic
unions
to
take
on
the
goliath
of
the
industry
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
