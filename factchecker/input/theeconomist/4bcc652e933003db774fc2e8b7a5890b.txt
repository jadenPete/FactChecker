republican
states
loosen
their
gun
laws
following
mass
shootings
this
is
not
as
counter-intuitive
as
it
seems
on
august
st
a
man
armed
with
an
ar-
rifle
fired
indiscriminately
along
a
mile
stretch
spanning
odessa
and
midland
two
cities
in
texas
at
least
people
were
injured
seven
were
killed
three
days
later
a
year-old
in
alabama
confessed
to
killing
five
family
members
his
father
stepmother
and
three
siblings
with
a
handgun
there
is
no
great
mystery
as
to
why
such
incidents
regularly
happen
in
america
and
not
any
other
rich
country
yet
its
lawmakers
are
reluctant
to
reduce
access
to
firearms
new
research
confirms
that
if
anything
mass
shootings
tend
to
lead
to
looser
gun
laws
not
stricter
ones
michael
luca
deepak
malhotra
and
christopher
poliquin
three
economists
have
published
a
working
paper
matching
mass
shootings
from
until
with
state
legislation
on
gun
control
the
authors
find
that
in
year
immediately
following
a
mass
shooting
republican
legislatures
passed
twice
as
many
laws
expanding
access
to
guns
compared
with
other
years
in
contrast
mr
luca
and
his
colleagues
find
that
overall
mass
shootings
have
no
significant
effect
on
firearms
legislation
in
states
controlled
by
democrats
part
of
this
might
be
because
guns
are
simply
a
much
bigger
deal
for
republicans
than
democrats
surveys
conducted
by
the
pew
research
centre
a
think-tank
found
that
of
republicans
believed
it
was
important
to
protect
the
right
of
americans
to
own
guns
in
compared
with
of
democrats
the
share
of
republicans
who
see
gun
rights
as
a
priority
has
risen
to
since
then
whereas
the
share
of
democrats
has
hardly
changed
mass
shootings
seem
only
to
further
galvanise
people
along
party
lines
a
study
published
this
year
by
david
barney
and
brian
schaffner
two
political
scientists
found
that
among
those
who
lived
within
miles
of
a
mass
shooting
average
support
for
stricter
gun
control
among
democrats
increased
by
two
percentage
points
the
opposite
was
true
for
republicans
less
than
hours
after
the
most
recent
mass
shooting
in
texas
nine
new
laws
came
into
effect
in
texas
all
making
it
easier
for
civilians
to
carry
guns
they
were
not
motivated
by
the
killings
in
odessa
and
midland
but
rather
by
prior
mass
killings
it
will
now
be
easier
for
licensed
gun
owners
to
take
their
weapons
into
churches
and
other
places
of
worship
schools
will
no
longer
be
able
to
prevent
gun
owners
from
keeping
ammunition
in
their
car
parks
greg
abbott
texas's
governor
says
his
state's
newly
enacted
laws
will
make
communities
safer
this
might
sound
backward
but
for
anyone
who
believes
that
guns
equal
safety
more
guns
make
perfect
sense
as
a
response
to
a
mass
shooting
president
donald
trump's
administration
is
preparing
new
legislation
which
will
expedite
the
execution
of
perpetrators
found
guilty
of
mass
killings
and
introduce
a
number
of
new
gun
reforms
the
texan
shooter
had
previously
failed
a
background
check
which
meant
he
was
unable
to
buy
a
gun
from
a
retailer
yet
he
was
able
to
obtain
a
rifle
from
a
private
seller
a
process
which
does
not
require
a
background
check
mr
trump's
mooted
changes
are
unlikely
to
close
this
loophole
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
