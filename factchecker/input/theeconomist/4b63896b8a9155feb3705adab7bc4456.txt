gay
mayors
who
cares
the
success
of
gay
politicians
completes
a
rapid
change
in
social
attitudes
it
made
for
an
awkward
first-date
conversation
pete
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
in
indiana
recalls
that
he
and
chasten
glezman
talked
about
how
he
would
be
seeking
higher
political
office
how
would
his
boyfriend-to-be
now
husband
feel
about
the
public
scrutiny
and
how
might
voters
respond
to
a
same-sex
couple
on
the
campaign
trail
mr
buttigieg
had
an
inkling
voters
would
mostly
shrug
he
had
been
nervous
about
coming
out
as
the
incumbent
mayor
in
but
he
went
on
to
win
re-election
that
year
with
of
the
vote
in
south
bend
even
conservatives
and
catholics
cared
more
about
his
efforts
to
revive
a
once-struggling
industrial
city
or
his
spell
soldiering
in
afghanistan
almost
the
only
time
his
sexual
orientation
now
gets
mentioned
he
says
is
when
somebody
wants
to
tell
him
they
are
at
ease
with
it
attitudes
to
once
controversial
issues
can
flip
from
bold
to
normal
with
baffling
speed
he
says
the
year-old
mayor
is
testing
that
notion
nationally
trying
a
long-shot
run
to
become
the
democrats
presidential
candidate
he
raised
m
in
the
past
quarter
a
decent
sum
that
should
place
him
among
the
more
serious
contenders
in
a
crowded
field
he
reckons
his
identity
as
young
out
from
the
midwest
helps
win
initial
interest
then
voters
will
judge
him
on
his
skill
as
a
speaker
and
his
ideas
it
is
much
the
same
story
in
chicago
where
lori
lightfoot
a
year-old
african-american
woman
married
to
another
woman
won
a
landslide
victory
in
a
run-off
election
to
become
mayor
on
april
nd
i'm
an
out
lesbian
married
with
a
child
running
in
this
city
the
first
to
ever
make
the
ballot
from
the
lgbtq
community
she
says
recalling
her
arrival
in
chicago
in
the
s
she
says
such
a
thing
was
not
even
remotely
possible
back
in
those
days
her
mayoral
campaign
saw
tense
moments
in
one
debate
her
opponent
toni
preckwinkle
praised
her
openness
about
her
sexuality
a
comment
that
sounded
like
a
dogwhistle
intended
to
deter
more
conservative
african-american
voters
leaflets
also
appeared
outside
black
churches
warning
that
ms
lightfoot
would
oversee
a
gay
cabal
in
city
hall
but
voters
again
mostly
shrugged
more
appeared
interested
in
her
positioning
as
an
outsider
promises
to
tackle
corruption
and
her
pledge
to
cut
police
violence
as
mayor
of
america's
third-largest
city
she
can
help
to
shift
perceptions
of
gay
politicians
some

annise
parker
was
mayor
of
houston
from
to
and
now
leads
the
lgbtq
victory
fund
which
helps
to
advise
other
out
politicians
she
praises
ms
lightfoot's
disciplined
campaign
and
expects
the
success
will
further
move
the
national
imagination
deepening
acceptance
of
gay
politicians
and
giving
the
city
something
to
cheer
she
says
houston
came
to
be
seen
as
more
diverse
open
and
appealing
after
voters
repeatedly
elected
her
to
various
posts
gay
politicians
are
growing
unexceptional
colorado
has
a
gay
governor
jared
polis
and
oregon
has
a
lesbian
one
kate
brown
ms
parker
estimates
there
are
roughly
openly
gay
public
officials
nationally
including
two
senators
and
eight
members
of
congress
all
of
them
democrats
the
victory
fund
endorsed
candidates
in
november's
elections
of
these
ms
parker
says
only
five
were
republicans
and
all
five
lost
americans
have
had
years
to
get
used
to
gay
people
in
public
office
kathy
kozachenko
a
student
in
ann
arbor
michigan
was
the
first
successful
gay
candidate
anywhere
winning
a
city
council
seat
in
april
but
opinion
has
shifted
quickly
more
recently
along
with
popular
acceptance
of
gay
marriage
it
amounts
to
a
quiet
welcome
and
probably
irreversible
turn
in
social
attitudes
the
pew
research
centre
found
nearly
half
of
americans
were
still
put
off
by
a
candidate
known
to
be
gay
in
but
that
fell
to
just
by
and
is
probably
lower
now
younger
voters
are
least
bothered
among
democrats
republicans
and
members
of
every
large
religious
group
other
than
evangelicals
a
majority
of
respondents
said
a
candidate's
sexual
orientation
is
irrelevant
for
some
it
might
be
an
asset
mr
buttigieg
for
example
might
struggle
harder
to
get
a
sympathetic
hearing
from
some
progressive
voters
if
he
were
merely
white
male
highly
educated
and
a
former
management
consultant
why
have
attitudes
changed
the
aids
crisis
in
the
s
forced
many
gay
men
to
come
out
then
as
laws
ended
discrimination
more
felt
ready
to
do
the
same
once
most
people
realised
they
personally
knew
someone
who
was
gay
they
grew
less
likely
to
object
to
gay
politicians
jonathan
rauch
of
the
brookings
institution
and
a
former
economist
writer
says
gay
activists
started
by
demanding
equal
rights
from
the
s
and
then
from
the
s
also
sought
equal
responsibilities
such
as
the
chance
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
marry
and
become
parents
that
process
he
says
led
to
the
triumph
of
an
assimilationist
model
in
which
gay
people
are
accepted
by
others
as
fitting
into
an
existing
social
order
rather
than
seen
as
trying
to
up-end
it
mr
rauch
cheers
politicians
who
are
open
about
their
orientation
but
not
defined
by
it
renewed
hostility
is
possible
president
donald
trump
has
hounded
transgender
people
for
example
in
ordering
them
out
of
the
armed
forces
but
even
he
has
not
criticised
openly
gay
politicians
the
political
space
open
to
mr
buttigieg
and
others
should
thus
continue
to
grow
in
the
world
where
i
grew
up
it
was
inconceivable
an
openly
gay
and
married
person
could
run
for
president
says
mr
rauch
of
south
bend's
mayor
his
odds
remain
long
but
they
are
better
than
for
any
other
openly
gay
politician
in
american
history
and
by
running
mr
buttigieg
makes
it
easier
for
the
next
out
politician
to
try
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics

rags
to
