the
federal
minimum
wage
is
becoming
irrelevant
a
patchwork
approach
to
setting
a
floor
on
pay
has
its
advantages
it
is
normal
for
america's
federal
minimum
wage
to
go
through
periods
of
declining
influence
it
is
fixed
in
cash
terms
meaning
it
bites
hardest
whenever
congress
raises
it
then
declines
in
relevance
as
earnings
grow
between
and
for
example
the
federal
minimum
stayed
constant
at
per
hour
while
average
wages
grew
by
around
what
is
unusual
about
the
last
decade
is
that
another
force
is
also
causing
the
federal
pay
floor
to
be
left
behind
state
and
local
governments
according
to
the
university
of
california
berkeley's
labour
centre
a
research
hub
cities
and
counties
apply
their
own
minimum
wages

to

a
new
analysis
from
ernie
tedeschi
of
evercore
isi
a
consultancy
quantifies
just
how
much
more
assertive
state
and
city
governments
have
become
during
the
early
s
with
the
federal
floor
flat
they
raised
their
minimum
wages
but
not
by
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
broader
labour
market
as
a
result
the
share
of
hours
worked
at
minimum
pay
either
federal
state
or
local
and
excluding
tipped
or
salaried
workers
fell
from
in
to
a
little
over
but
since
despite
wage
growth
and
a
flat
federal
minimum
the
share
of
hours
worked
at
some
minimum
wage
has
stayed
constant
at
around
the
explanation
is
growing
intervention
outside
washington
in
state
and
local
minimum
wages
were
binding
for
around
of
hours
worked
at
some
pay
floor
in
that
share
is
fully
meanwhile
as
rich
cities
have
raised
their
minimum
wages
dramatically
their
minimum-wage
workers
have
as
a
group
been
climbing
up
the
nation's
income
distribution
the
average
pay
of
minimum-wage
workers
a
group
which
now
varies
a
lot
by
place
has
risen
to
of
the
national
median
wage
mr
tedeschi
finds
that
is
up
sharply
from
between
and
for
the
entire
period
between
and
there
are
advantages
to
the
emerging
patchwork
of
policies
the
risks
of
raising
the
minimum
wage
are
lower
in
rich
places
local
governments
might
fine-tune
their
wage
floors
to
economic
conditions
by
contrast
the
federal
minimum
wage
is
a
blunt
instrument
it
cannot
take
into
account
geographical
differences
in
productivity
economic
conditions
or
the
bargaining
power
of
workers
nonetheless
some
democrats
want
to
restore
the
prominence
of
the
federal
minimum
wage
by
boosting
it
to
senator
bernie
sanders
introduced
a
bill
earlier
this
year
that
would
do
just
that
by
but
it
has
yet
to
gather
enough
support
from
democrats
to
pass
even
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
would
have
no
hope
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
a
different
proposal
from
terri
sewell
a
democratic
congresswoman
would
allow
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
vary
regionally
with
the
cost
of
living
but
it
has
met
resistance
from
those
on
the
left
who
do
not
want
the
lower
wage
floors
for
workers
in
southern
states
and
rural
counties
that
regional
adjustments
would
bring
republican
scepticism
of
government
meddling
makes
it
likely
that
the
federal
minimum
wage
will
be
left
to
wither
for
a
few
more
years
for
workers
in
places
that
are
seeing
minimum-wage
increases
this
may
not
matter
much
so
long
as
their
employers
do
not
skip
town
the
rest
will
be
left
to
fend
for
themselves
if
they
are
lucky
the
hot
labour-market
will
force
their
employers
to
fork
out
for
higher
wages
anyway
they
might
then
ask
what
purpose
there
is
for
a
federal
minimum
wage
that
is
so
low
as
to
be
completely
irrelevant
