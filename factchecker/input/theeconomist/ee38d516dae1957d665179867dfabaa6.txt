donald
trump
fires
john
bolton
his
third
national
security
adviser
they
disagree
even
about
whether
he
was
sacked
or
resigned
many
were
justifiably
puzzled
when
donald
trump
named
john
bolton
national
security
adviser
mr
trump
entered
office
as
an
outsider
who
sneered
at
washington
mr
bolton
has
spent
his
career
ping-ponging
between
republican
administrations
and
conservative
think-tanks
mr
trump
is
sceptical
of
overseas
entanglements
mr
bolton
believes
in
force
projection
they
shared
a
disdain
for
barack
obama's
iran
deal
though
for
different
reasons
mr
trump
wants
to
erase
his
predecessor's
legacy
mr
bolton
never
trusted
iran
mr
bolton
supported
nato
and
mistrusted
russia's
president
vladimir
putin
mr
trump
held
opposite
views
on
both
a
rocky
marriage
which
lasted
months
has
now
ended
on
september
th
mr
trump
sacked
mr
bolton
in
his
usual
unceremonious
fashion
by
tweet
i
informed
john
bolton
last
night
that
his
services
are
no
longer
needed
at
the
white
house
said
the
president
adding
i
disagreed
strongly
with
many
of
his
suggestions
as
did
others
in
the
administration
mr
bolton
and
the
white
house
spent
the
ensuing
hours
disputing
the
terms
of
his
resignation
mr
bolton
says
he
offered
it
freely
mr
trump's
press
secretary
says
mr
trump
demanded
it
whatever
the
truth
his
departure
was
sudden
he
was
scheduled
to
brief
the
white
house
that
afternoon
and
indicative
more
of
mr
trump's
erratic
managerial
style
than
a
substantive
policy
shift
from
his
administration
mr
bolton
was
appointed
to
the
job
in
april
succeeding
h.r.
mcmaster
a
cerebral
general
whom
mr
trump
derided
as
a
boxy-suited
beer
salesman
mr
bolton
by
contrast
was
a
hardened
ideologue
and
political
bruiser
having
served
the
federal
bureaucracy
during
the
previous
three
republican
administrations
his
unapologetic
scorn
for
multilateralism
the
united
nations
and
international
accords
and
his
obsession
with
rogue
states
typified
a
muscular
and
pugnacious
strand
of
conservative
foreign-policy
thinking
predictably
that
appears
to
be
precisely
what
put
him
on
a
collision
course
with
mr
trump
who
had
joked
that
mr
bolton
was
going
to
get
us
into
a
war
on
north
korea
mr
bolton
was
sceptical
of
the
president's
charm
offensive
towards
the
country's
dictator
kim
jong
un
in
may
mr
bolton
complained
that
a
pair
of
short-range
missile
launches
by
north
korea
violated
un
security
council
resolutions
shortly
afterwards
mr
trump
insisted
that
the
small
weapons
had
disturbed
some
of
my
people
but
not
me
batting
away
his
adviser's
concerns
one
month
later
the
president
stepped
into
north
korean
territory
for
his
third
meeting
with
mr
kim
while
mr
bolton
was
pointedly
dispatched
to
mongolia
mr
bolton
had
more
luck
steering
american
policy
on
iran
tightening
sanctions
and
intensifying
a
campaign
of
maximum
pressure
in
june
it
was
mr
bolton
rather
than
the
president
who
announced
the
dispatch
of
an
aircraft-carrier
strike
group
and
bombers
to
the
middle
east
in
response
to
concerns
over
iran-backed
attacks
on
american
forces
in
the
region
but
soon
after
iran
shot
down
an
american
drone
mr
trump
called
off
airstrikes
that
mr
bolton
had
supported
in
the
end
it
was
afghanistan
that
brought
matters
to
a
head
mr
trump
exasperated
with
the
war
was
close
to
signing
an
agreement
with
the
taliban
that
would
have
begun
the
process
of
american
withdrawal
he
devised
a
plan
to
invite
the
taliban
and
afghanistan's
president
to
camp
david
the
presidential
retreat
the
weekend
before
september
th
though
mr
trump
reversed
course
after
a
taliban
suicide-bombing
killed
people
including
an
american
soldier
he
lost
patience
with
mr
bolton's
dogged
opposition
as
well
as
his
bellicose
views
mr
bolton
was
also
criticised
for
his
overbearing
style
he
was
known
for
keeping
dissenting
views
from
the
president
and
reducing
the
number
of
high-level
policy
meetings
he
has
few
allies
and
wears
out
his
welcome
a
member
of
mr
obama's
national-security
team
called
him
national-security
furniture
with
a
moustache
a
really
loud
couch
no
one
wanted
george
w.
bush
whom
mr
bolton
served
as
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
said
near
the
end
of
his
administration
that
he
did
not
consider
bolton
credible
mr
bolton
departs
as
mr
trump's
hunger
for
a
legacy-defining
international
deal
grows
more
apparent
notwithstanding
the
scotched
taliban
talks
mr
trump
is
still
playing
footsie
with
mr
kim
and
has
recently
expressed
a
willingness
to
meet
iran's
foreign
minister
if
the
administration
has
any
sceptical
voices
left
they
have
been
awfully
quiet
and
mr
bolton's
head
on
a
spike
will
keep
them
quieter
still
that
leaves
america
in
a
dangerous
place
with
a
mercurial
president
who
has
long
given
a
higher
priority
to
personal
interests
than
national
ones
eager
to
strike
a
historic
accord
to
cement
his
legacy
and
apparently
prizing
pliancy
above
honesty
in
his
staff
for
now
charles
kupperman
long
an
adviser
to
mr
bolton
is
acting
national
security
adviser
mr
trump
said
he
would
make
a
permanent
appointment
to
the
post
next
week
that
would
make
his
fourth
a
single-term
record
the
only
one
for
whom
he
seemed
to
harbour
genuinely
warm
feelings
was
mike
flynn
who
will
be
sentenced
in
december
for
lying
to
federal
investigators
mr
trump
publicly
derided
both
mr
mcmaster
and
mr
bolton
whomever
he
chooses
next
needs
either
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros
or
more
likely
an
ability
to
flatter
and
keep
below
the
parapet
but
america
has
probably
not
heard
the
last
of
mr
bolton
who
is
unlikely
to
replicate
the
dignified
silences
of
mr
mcmaster
or
james
mattis
an
ousted
defence
secretary
two
years
after
leaving
the
second
bush
administration
he
cast
a
withering
judgment
on
its
decision
to
engage
in
limited
diplomacy
with
north
korea
nothing
can
erase
the
ineffable
sadness
of
an
american
presidency
like
this
one
in
total
intellectual
collapse
little
did
he
then
know
how
much
further
things
could
go
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
