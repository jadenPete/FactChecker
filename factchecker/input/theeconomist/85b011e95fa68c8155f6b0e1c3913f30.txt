what
donald
trump's
campaign
swag
says
about
his
presidency
his
t-shirts
like
his
tweets
come
tinged
with
cultural
grievances
william
henry
harrison
was
in
when
he
became
the
whigs
presidential
candidate
his
rivals
mocked
his
advanced
age
calling
him
granny
and
joking
give
him
a
barrel
of
hard
cider
and
a
pension
of
two
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
he
will
sit
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
a
log
cabin
harrison
ran
with
the
insult
though
born
to
a
wealthy
family
he
styled
himself
the
log-cabin-and-cider
candidate
a
man
of
the
people
he
cast
his
opponent
martin
van
buren
as
an
out-of-touch
elitist
his
supporters
sold
trinkets
plates
lamps
and
handkerchiefs
with
log-cabin
designs
thus
began
the
american
political
tradition
of
producing
and
distributing
campaign
merchandise
usually
a
campaign
hands
out
yard
signs
buttons
and
stickers
with
the
candidate's
name
and
perhaps
an
anodyne
slogan
such
as
kamala
harris
for
the
people
or
warren
has
a
plan
for
that
donald
trump's
campaign
takes
a
different
approach
rather
than
bland
slogans
designed
not
to
offend
his
campaign
prefers
red
meat
for
the
base
earlier
this
summer
the
president's
campaign
began
selling
branded
trump
plastic
straws
after
his
campaign
manager
grew
frustrated
with
a
flimsy
paper
one
they
cost
for
a
pack
of
ten
but
sold
out
quickly
the
straws
are
not
just
straws
they
express
the
sort
of
cultural
grievance
that
has
defined
mr
trump's
presidency
liberals
want
to
ban
us
the
straws
say
to
his
supporters
but
we
work
better
than
the
politically
correct
alternative
you
like
us
and
using
us
lets
you
show
your
support
while
triggering
the
libs
mr
trump's
party
has
followed
suit
a
few
days
after
mr
trump
baffled
the
world
by
musing
about
buying
greenland
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
began
flogging
t-shirts
depicting
the
island
as
part
of
america
his
campaign
also
sells
material
such
as
pencil-neck
adam
schiff
t-shirts
which
depict
the
chairman
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
as
a
clown
and
fredo
unhinged
shirts
which
show
chris
cuomo
a
television
anchor
mid-meltdown
campaigns
usually
leave
such
mean
stuff
such
as
bill
clinton
corkscrews
you
can
guess
where
the
screw
protrudes
or
hillary
clinton
nutcrackers
to
third
parties
mr
trump's
campaign
is
nimble
the
cuomo
shirts
were
on
sale
a
day
after
the
anchor
threatened
to
shove
someone
down
a
flight
of
stairs
for
calling
him
fredo
the
weak
brother
in
the
godfather
films
politico
which
covers
washington
politics
reported
that
the
campaign
manager's
straw
broke
as
he
was
boarding
a
flight
by
the
time
he
landed
the
campaign
was
already
advertising
the
trump
straws
they
were
not
focus-grouped
or
run
through
committees
just
made
and
sold
that
works
for
trinkets
it
may
be
less
effective
for
policy
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
