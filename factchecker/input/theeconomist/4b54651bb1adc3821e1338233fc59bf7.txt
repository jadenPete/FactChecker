facebook
has
unleashed
a
new
dating
service
it
could
return
dating
to
its
pre-internet
ways
in
america
it
is
no
longer
merely
acceptable
to
meet
your
romantic
partner
on
the
internet
it
is
the
norm
the
latest
data
from
a
long-running
survey
by
researchers
at
stanford
released
this
summer
shows
that
of
new
heterosexual
couples
met
online
in
far
more
than
at
bars
through
friends
or
at
work
for
gay
couples
the
proportion
is
even
higher
at
little
wonder
then
that
facebook
is
bringing
a
dating
service
to
the
richest
denizens
of
its
internet
fief
facebook
dating
launched
in
america
on
september
th
having
been
tested
first
in
smaller
markets
such
as
colombia
and
canada
american
facebook
users
seeking
significant
others
can
now
find
the
dating
service
in
a
dedicated
tab
within
the
firm's
smartphone
app
willing
daters
must
explicitly
create
a
profile
and
fill
in
their
preferences
users
may
if
they
wish
tap
into
their
social
graph
to
look
for
matches
among
friends
of
friends
but
that
option
is
not
on
by
default
facebook
says
any
data
generated
while
searching
will
be
kept
separate
from
its
main
service
and
not
used
to
target
ads
facebook
dating
has
the
potential
to
break
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
internet
dating
most
dating
apps
pair
up
strangers
rather
than
friends
of
friends
for
instance
tinder
the
most
popular
dating
app
pairs
people
up
by
allowing
them
to
choose
from
a
menu
of
potential
partners
within
a
set
radius
of
where
they
are
okcupid
a
more
old-school
text-based
approach
asks
users
to
read
through
a
profile
real-life
pairings
are
usually
circumscribed
by
a
person's
social
sphere
and
the
chances
of
meeting
a
total
stranger
are
low
but
online
most
people
are
paired
with
strangers
some
sociology
research
suggests
that
this
means
that
online
dating
has
the
potential
to
create
couples
from
more
diverse
backgrounds
than
would
tend
to
form
in
real
life
possibly
helping
to
reduce
income
inequality
over
time
facebook's
effort
will
also
make
it
possible
to
match
anonymously
but
trawling
through
friends
of
friends
is
likely
to
prove
more
alluring
thus
facebook
is
remaking
the
old
world
that
was
governed
by
social
ties
probably
reducing
any
benefits
that
may
have
come
with
less
assortative
coupling
through
online
dating
these
are
inauspicious
times
for
mark
zuckerberg's
company
to
roll
out
a
dating
service
the
firm
is
under
antitrust
investigation
from
attorneys-general
in
eight
american
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
the
firm's
record
on
handling
user
data
is
poor
adding
dating
information
to
the
mix
which
includes
sexual
orientation
and
perhaps
hiv
status
seems
bold
at
best
misguided
at
worst
still
recent
history
suggests
facebook
dating
will
be
a
success
the
firm
has
more
tools
at
its
disposal
to
help
its
amorous
users
find
a
good
match
than
any
other
dating
service
thanks
to
its
huge
user
base
and
its
trove
of
their
data
although
user
growth
on
facebook
itself
is
slowing
users
seem
generally
unfazed
by
the
firm's
numerous
missteps
its
other
services
including
whatsapp
and
instagram
are
still
growing
strongly
if
that
success
is
anything
to
go
by
it
suggests
that
future
versions
of
the
stanford
survey
may
do
well
to
break
out
a
new
category
of
coupling
facebook
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
