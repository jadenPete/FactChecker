baltimore
needs
help
to
fix
its
crime
problems
charm
city
cannot
catch
a
break
at
seven
in
the
morning
on
july
th
david
caldwell
a
year-old
phlebotomist
was
shot
and
killed
in
the
methadone
clinic
on
maryland
avenue
where
he
worked
a
little
more
than
halfway
through
the
year
he
was
the
st
person
killed
in
the
city
of
baltimore
and
the
st
killed
by
a
gun
it
was
a
grisly
scene
the
suspected
shooter
a
year-old
man
demanding
methadone
was
shot
dead
in
the
standoff
with
police
one
officer
was
also
shot
though
he
is
expected
to
survive
based
on
historic
patterns
baltimore
is
on
track
to
have
murders
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
could
exceed
the
tally
in
new
york
a
city
with
times
as
many
people
the
number
has
passed
every
year
since
that
spring
freddie
gray
a
year-old
black
man
died
in
police
custody
and
the
city
exploded
in
protest
rioting
and
looting
tore
up
the
city's
poorest
neighbourhoods
victorian
row
houses
were
lit
by
the
glow
of
flames
it
does
not
appear
to
have
recovered
since
unfortunately
all
the
cameras
have
gone
but
the
socioeconomic
plight
of
the
community
has
remained
says
nick
mosby
a
maryland
state
delegate
who
was
the
city
councilman
for
sandtown-winchester
the
west
baltimore
neighbourhood
where
freddie
gray
lived
it
is
black
median
household
income
is
merely
and
a
third
of
the
buildings
are
vacant
or
abandoned
it
is
a
place
where
people
buy
their
groceries
in
liquor
stores
protected
by
bulletproof
glass
whether
it's
west
baltimore
or
north
philadelphia
urban
blight
looks
like
urban
blight
and
it's
as
american
as
apple
pie
says
mr
mosby
what
beset
baltimore
left-leaning
activists
explain
the
city's
slump
by
pointing
to
the
legacy
of
historic
segregation
the
city
pioneered
the
use
of
restrictive
covenants
to
prevent
blacks
from
moving
to
good
neighbourhoods
and
generations
of
concentrated
poverty
racist
policing
crumbling
infrastructure
and
failing
schools
all
this
is
true
but
none
has
worsened
enough
recently
to
explain
the
dramatic
rise
in
crime
since
gray's
death
when
i
think
of
april
i
think
about
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel's
back
says
brandon
scott
the
year-old
president
of
the
city
council
something
else
must
have
happened
the
most
prominent
candidate-theories
focus
on
the
police
the
baltimore
police
department
bpd
had
to
change
after
the
unrest
its
relationship
with
the
community
was
in
a
shambles
marilyn
mosby
the
state's
attorney
for
baltimore
who
is
also
married
to
mr
mosby
the
delegate
charged
the
six
officers
involved
with
gray's
death
but
none
was
convicted
a
scathing
report
from
the
department
of
justice
doj
extensively
documented
a
pattern
of
racial
discrimination
and
excessive
force
in
the
department
entered
a
consent
decree
with
a
federal
court
requiring
it
to
reform
some
members
of
the
baltimore
police
both
former
and
current
claim
that
the
falling
out
with
city
leaders
left
them
feeling
without
support
so
they
pulled
back
they
say
less
often
getting
out
of
their
cars
to
attempt
forceful
proactive
enforcement
the
idea
of
clearing
the
corner
was
central
to
baltimore
says
peter
moskos
a
former
patrol
officer
in
the
city
who
is
now
a
professor
of
criminology
but
cops
said
ok
if
you
don't
want
us
to
clear
the
corners
we
won't
the
data
bear
this
out
in
the
year
before
gray's
death
police
were
making
arrests
a
month
since
then
arrests
have
dropped
but
another
explanation
contends
that
the
more
important
shock
to
behaviour
after
the
unrest
was
not
among
the
police
but
among
baltimore's
residents
events
like
gray's
death
shake
community
trust
meaning
that
co-operation
with
police
investigations
and
even
reporting
of
criminal
offences
drops
in
the
aftermath
of
a
highly
publicised
incident
in
milwaukee
in
when
an
unarmed
biracial
man
was
severely
beaten
by
off-duty
white
cops
three
sociologists
found
that
residents
in
black
neighbourhoods
were
much
less
likely
to
call
to
report
crimes
for
up
to
a
year
afterwards
this
coincided
with
a
significant
spike
in
homicides
in
baltimore
there
are
good
reasons
to
distrust
the
police
last
year
federal
prosecutors
convicted
members
of
an
elite
police
squad
the
gun
trace
task
force
of
widespread
corruption
instead
of
taking
illegal
guns
off
the
streets
the
unit
planted
evidence
on
innocent
civilians
and
robbed
drug-dealers
and
then
resold
the
goods
in
this
account
of
things
a
frequent
target
of
ire
is
martin
o'malley
who
was
mayor
of
the
city
from
to
before
becoming
governor
of
maryland
for
his
policy
of
aggressive
policing
to
deter
violent
crime
mr
o'malley
who
still
lives
in
the
city
defends
his
record
he
notes
that
crime
declined
while
he
was
in
office
and
that
the
damning
doj
report
only
examined
conduct
after
mr
o'malley
gives
two
reasons
why
the
city
is
having
to
take
the
same
real
estate
twice
first
baltimore
stopped
policing
the
police
stopped
supervising
stopped
following
up
on
citizen
complaints
of
discourtesy
excessive
force
and
other
things
he
says
second
the
number
of
cops
fell
from
a
high
of
in
to
today
one
of
the
most
violent
cities
in
america
decided
to
cut
its
police
force
by
about
and
there
wasn't
even
a
whimper
of
objection
from
the
city
council
or
any
of
the
editorial
powers
in
town
he
says
the
riots
exposed
that
sort
of
soft
underbelly
in
the
police
department
says
jason
johnson
a
former
deputy
commissioner
for
the
bpd
from
to
the
homicide
department
has
barely
enough
detectives
to
solve
homicides
it
was
a
kind
of
awakening
to
the
criminal
underground
in
baltimore
shootings
and
homicides
increased
but
there
was
no
increase
in
the
number
of
detectives
nor
any
improvements
to
antiquated
technology
or
dilapidated
training
headquarters
in
only
of
homicide
cases
were
cleared
when
cases
start
to
pile
on
top
of
one
another
you
have
more
acts
of
violence
that
people
are
inclined
to
avenge
says
daniel
webster
a
professor
at
johns
hopkins
university
who
led
a
homicide
review
for
the
city
mr
webster
argues
that
although
most
people
want
more
cops
on
the
beat
the
real
need
is
more
resources
for
serious
investigations
compounding
the
problem
in
baltimore
was
a
nationwide
surge
in
demand
for
illicit
opioids
for
decades
baltimore
has
had
a
serious
heroin
problem
concentrated
among
poor
black
people
today
baltimore
has
morphed
into
a
drug
destination
officers
and
residents
describe
middle-class
teenagers
and
housewives
driving
in
from
the
suburbs
to
score
drugs
mr
scott
the
city
council
president
says
he
finds
it
ironic
that
after
decades
of
ignoring
heroin
epidemics
in
predominately
black
cities
such
as
baltimore
the
rest
of
america
is
now
suffering
nobody
really
knows
how
many
drug
users
there
are
in
baltimore
the
most
reliable
data
come
from
the
city
morgue
in
opioid
overdoses
claimed
the
lives
of
baltimoreans
four-fifths
from
heroin
by
that
number
had
more
than
tripled
to
deaths
as
fentanyl
an
extremely
potent
synthetic
opioid
supplanted
heroin
baltimore
has
the
highest
opioid
fatality
rate
of
any
city
in
the
country
twice
that
of
west
virginia
which
is
the
worst-affected
state
business
is
booming
from
the
drug
dealers
perspective
says
mr
johnson
the
former
deputy
police
commissioner
and
in
black-market
business
competition
usually
means
violence
violent
crime
in
baltimore
as
in
every
city
involves
a
small
network
of
people
and
a
clutch
of
city
blocks
much
of
it
revolves
around
the
drug
trade
and
avenging
past
deeds
whether
slights
or
slaughters
of
those
murdered
in
had
previous
arrest
records
as
did
of
the
suspects
the
problems
of
crime
and
addiction
are
difficult
but
they
should
not
be
insurmountable
sadly
baltimore
has
endured
so
much
turbulence
at
its
highest
echelons
of
power
in
recent
years
that
new
plans
have
scarcely
had
time
to
be
drafted
since
gray's
death
there
have
been
five
police
commissioners
some
fell
foul
of
the
mayor
while
others
fell
foul
of
the
law
in
may
the
mayor
herself
catherine
pugh
was
forced
to
resign
from
office
after
a
scandal
involving
bulk
purchases
of
her
insipid
children's
book
by
companies
who
did
business
with
the
city
she
is
the
second
mayor
to
have
to
resign
in
a
decade
the
next
mayor
will
face
huge
challenges
we
are
a
city
that
doesn't
have
a
transit
system
we
don't
have
fast
broadband
we
have
an
ageing
water
system
says
seema
iyer
of
the
university
of
baltimore
vacant
buildings
depress
property
values
provide
places
for
criminals
to
hide
and
scare
off
prospective
businesses
the
city's
schools
are
decrepit
having
stabilised
at
the
time
of
freddie
gray's
death
baltimore's
population
is
now
falling
again
it
is
tempting
for
lawmakers
in
annapolis
the
state
capital
and
nearby
washington
to
blame
the
city
for
its
troubles
corruption
and
poor
policing
are
certainly
unforced
errors
people
of
all
political
stripes
have
high
hopes
for
michael
harrison
the
freshly
appointed
police
commissioner
from
new
orleans
though
he
will
need
longer
than
the
now-customary
one-year
term
to
change
much
still
many
of
the
forces
buffeting
baltimore
and
its
poorest
residents
are
outside
its
control
history
weighs
heavily
to
dig
itself
out
of
its
rut
the
city
will
need
help
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
