arkansas
puts
work
requirements
on
medicaid
you'll
never
guess
what
happened
next
casey
copeland's
addiction
to
heroin
landed
him
in
jail
but
he
came
out
scared
straight
without
a
job
he
signed
up
for
health
insurance
through
medicaid
the
government
health-insurance
programme
for
the
poorest
and
took
up
volunteering
at
a
charity
that
helps
the
homeless
mr
copeland
thought
that
was
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
work
requirement
arkansas
had
recently
put
on
the
programme
and
didn't
notice
the
letters
from
the
state
that
were
piling
up
after
three
months
of
non-compliance
his
insurance
was
cancelled
mr
copeland
is
reapplying
but
in
the
meantime
he
is
uninsured
he
had
to
return
the
machine
to
treat
his
sleep
apnea
a
condition
which
causing
breathing
difficulties
mr
copeland
is
sanguine
about
this
even
as
he
recounts
that
without
the
machine
he
once
stopped
breathing
times
in
a
single
night
in
january
the
trump
administration
signalled
that
for
the
first
time
since
medicaid
was
introduced
in
it
would
grant
waivers
to
states
allowing
them
to
place
community
engagement
conditions
on
the
programme
able-bodied
adult
recipients
would
need
to
work
volunteer
or
study
for
a
set
number
of
hours
to
keep
their
coverage
it
is
the
most
significant
change
to
welfare
policy
of
donald
trump's
presidency
according
to
estimates
by
the
kaiser
family
foundation
a
think-tank
if
similar
requirements
were
implemented
nationwide
between
m
and
m
people
would
lose
coverage
fifteen
states
almost
all
republican-led
quickly
applied
arkansas
became
the
first
to
implement
the
new
rules
starting
in
june
the
big
reforms
to
cash
welfare
during
the
s
came
about
in
a
similar
way
states
were
granted
authority
to
experiment
with
making
benefits
conditional
on
work
and
introducing
lifetime
limits
eventually
these
were
codified
nationwide
under
bill
clinton
the
arguments
in
favour
are
the
same
now
this
is
an
effort
to
essentially
be
compassionate
and
not
to
trap
people
onto
government
programmes
or
to
create
greater
dependency
on
public
assistance
says
seema
verma
the
administrator
for
the
centres
for
medicare
and
medicaid
services
cms
if
you're
living
in
poverty
you
need
more
than
just
a
medicaid
card
you
need
a
pathway
out
of
poverty
notes
ms
verma
asa
hutchinson
the
governor
of
arkansas
takes
a
similar
line
it's
balancing
that
compassion
with
the
other
value
of
our
country
which
is
responsibility
he
says
the
preliminary
results
from
the
arkansas
experiment
look
alarming
people
lost
their
health
insurance
in
the
first
six
months
because
they
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
confusion
seems
widespread
many
only
realise
they
have
lost
insurance
in
the
pharmacy
after
trying
to
pick
up
a
prescription
they
can
no
longer
afford
in
some
months
more
than
of
those
required
to
report
their
activities
did
not
for
the
first
few
months
reporting
could
only
be
done
online
more
than
of
those
affected
did
not
have
access
to
the
internet
those
that
did
found
the
website
which
shuts
down
between
pm
and
am
clunky
and
complicated
in
theory
placing
work
requirements
on
welfare
programmes
can
result
in
higher
employment
and
less
government
spending
in
arkansas
though
the
labour-market
effects
are
hard
to
detect
state
officials
point
to
a
report
showing
that
over
the
first
six
months
of
the
new
policy
medicaid
participants
found
work
but
it
is
unclear
whether
people
are
moving
from
unemployment
to
work
or
merely
switching
jobs
similar
numbers
before
the
work
requirement
went
into
place
which
would
allow
for
comparison
are
unavailable
there
is
no
baseline
data
and
that
lack
of
data
is
really
concerning
says
kevin
de
liban
of
legal
aid
of
arkansas
which
is
suing
the
state
to
reverse
the
policy
in
practice
people
who
are
eligible
can
fail
to
jump
through
bureaucratic
hoops
and
end
up
with
neither
work
nor
welfare
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuit
against
the
state
is
adrian
mcgonigal
a
year-old
chicken-plant
worker
with
respiratory
problems
without
a
computer
smartphone
or
access
to
transport
to
a
public
library
he
failed
to
meet
the
work
requirements
and
lost
his
health
coverage
which
he
only
learned
after
trying
to
fill
the
prescription
for
his
medication
without
insurance
this
would
have
cost
which
he
did
not
have
mr
mcgonigal
went
without
got
sick
and
missed
several
days
at
work
for
which
he
was
then
sacked
because
of
the
volatile
nature
of
low-wage
work
in
which
earnings
and
hours
change
seasonally
or
erratically
the
chances
of
someone
working
insufficient
hours
to
meet
the
requirement
or
having
an
income
that
is
temporarily
over
the
limit
and
thereby
losing
health
coverage
is
fairly
high
more
than
of
able-bodied
adults
who
receive
medicaid
already
work
most
of
those
who
do
not
are
typically
in
poor
health
taking
care
of
young
children
or
disabled
relatives
or
in
school
all
of
which
exempt
them
from
the
work
requirements
another
analysis
from
the
kaiser
family
foundation
finds
that
only
of
adult
medicaid
recipients
are
currently
not
working
and
unlikely
to
fall
into
these
exempt
categories
understanding
whether
the
arkansas
experiment
is
successful
requires
knowing
whether
those
people
who
lost
their
coverage
after
the
new
rules
came
in
have
moved
on
to
other
health
insurance
or
employment
yet
that
is
strikingly
difficult
to
find
out
and
the
state
is
not
trying
too
hard
you're
asking
who
they
are
i
don't
have
the
statistical
information
it
hasn't
been
broken
down
says
mr
hutchinson
the
governor
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
of
those
somebody
out
there
is
healthy
has
received
a
notice
understands
the
responsibility
but
just
doesn't
do
it
and
what
do
you
do
at
that
point
he
asks
state
officials
did
launch
an
outreach
campaign
but
found
that
many
people
in
the
medicaid
programme
were
not
contactable
these
people
could
have
already
moved
up
the
income
ladder
received
insurance
through
an
employer
or
spouse
or
moved
out
of
state
says
cindy
gillespie
the
director
of
the
arkansas
department
of
human
services
because
the
coverage
lock-out
ends
every
calendar
year
those
barred
from
medicaid
last
year
can
reapply
only
have
done
so
which
state
officials
and
ms
verma
see
as
evidence
that
only
a
few
legitimately
claimed
the
coverage
ms
gillespie
also
points
out
that
hospitals
are
not
reporting
increased
uncompensated
care
we
would
expect
that
if
there
were
a
lot
of
people
who
were
actually
using
their
insurance
that
we
would
see
a
rise
in
uncompensated
care
she
says
mandy
davis
the
director
of
jericho
way
a
day
centre
for
the
homeless
sees
it
differently
the
people
she
helps
get
a
letter
and
they
don't
understand
it
or
they
try
to
fill
their
medication
and
are
denied
says
ms
davis
there's
the
assumption
that
people
are
computer
literate
or
just
literate
to
begin
with
she
has
helped
read
aloud
the
official
letters
giving
notice
of
lost
coverage
to
those
who
have
trouble
understanding
them
these
are
hard
letters
to
read
she
says
we're
having
to
find
the
nurses
and
doctors
who
will
provide
medical
care
for
free
the
same
ones
we
used
to
call
ten
years
ago
