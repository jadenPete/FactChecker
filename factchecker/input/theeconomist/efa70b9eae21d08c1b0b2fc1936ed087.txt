the
new
push
to
overturn
roe
v
wade
a
dozen
states
have
introduced
heartbeat
bills
that
would
ban
early
abortion
though
conservatives
are
by
and
large
taking
a
kicking
in
the
culture
wars
they
continue
to
hold
ground
on
one
front
abortion
americans
increasingly
accept
the
right
of
gays
to
adopt
children
and
marry
but
they
have
not
moved
in
a
similar
direction
on
women's
right
to
terminate
unwanted
pregnancies
abortion
is
as
controversial
as
it
was
years
ago
when
the
supreme
court
ruled
it
a
constitutional
right
in
roe
v
wade
hence
the
success
of
unplanned
a
low-grade
blood-spattered
film
about
an
abortion
nurse-turned
pro-lifer
that
has
become
a
box-office
hit
more
significant
fresh
evidence
of
americans
antipathy
to
abortion
comes
in
the
form
of
legislation
in
the
first
three
months
of
states
introduced
bills
that
ban
abortion
from
the
moment
a
fetal
heartbeat
is
detectable
that
happens
around
the
sixth
week
of
pregnancy
two
weeks
after
a
missed
menstrual
period
when
many
women
do
not
yet
know
they
are
pregnant
in
other
words
the
bills
come
close
to
being
total
abortion
bans
around
half
have
made
it
through
at
least
one
legislative
chamber
in
some
states
they
have
been
signed
into
law
in
march
a
heartbeat
bill
was
signed
by
mississippi's
republican
governor
georgia's
governor
also
a
republican
is
expected
to
approve
a
similar
bill
there
sparking
threats
of
a
hollywood
boycott
of
a
state
that
is
a
hub
for
film
and
tv
production
the
rush
of
state-level
heartbeat
bills
represents
a
shift
in
strategy
by
some
anti-abortionists
since
pro-lifers
have
for
the
most
part
focused
on
chipping
away
at
roe
by
introducing
burdensome
regulations
that
make
it
harder
to
obtain
an
abortion
these
range
from
imposing
waiting
periods
between
a
consultation
at
a
clinic
and
an
abortion
which
can
be
difficult
for
women
in
states
with
few
clinics
to
dictating
the
width
of
clinic
corridors
this
approach
has
been
successful
the
guttmacher
institute
a
pro-choice
research
group
says
abortion
restrictions
were
introduced
between
and
eight
states
have
only
one
abortion
clinic
heartbeat
bills
by
contrast
are
straightforward
violations
of
roe
and
so
liable
to
be
struck
down
by
the
courts
almost
as
soon
as
they
become
law
in
march
a
federal
judge
in
kentucky
blocked
a
heartbeat
bill
the
day
the
governor
signed
it
a
similar
law
was
blocked
in
iowa
in
january
mississippi's
will
almost
certainly
be
halted
before
it
comes
into
effect
in
july
pro-lifers
are
nonetheless
persisting
with
this
campaign
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
supreme
court
to
weigh
in
on
the
issue
excited
by
the
court's
new
conservative
majority
champions
of
heartbeat
bills
hope
the
justices
may
use
one
to
overturn
roe
as
donald
trump
promised
them
during
his
presidential
campaign
as
that
suggests
republican
politicians
are
aware
that
merely
dangling
that
prospect
is
a
big
vote-winner
in
reality
heartbeat
bills
are
unlikely
to
achieve
their
promised
goal
mr
trump's
new
justices
neil
gorsuch
and
brett
kavanaugh
are
conservative
christians
who
hate
abortion
but
neither
appears
ready
to
overturn
the
year
precedent
that
roe
represents
and
chief
justice
john
roberts
a
conservative
who
has
himself
expressed
scepticism
about
roe's
legal
basis
is
anxious
for
the
court
to
appear
non-partisan
it
is
more
likely
that
the
supreme
court's
conservative
majority
will
undermine
roe
by
upholding
stringent
anti-abortion
regulations
mary
ziegler
a
professor
at
the
florida
state
university
college
of
law
says
it
may
inflict
the
worst
damage
by
agreeing
that
regulations
do
not
create
an
undue
burden
on
women's
access
to
abortion
the
standard
used
by
courts
to
determine
whether
restrictions
are
constitutional
the
court
is
expected
to
rule
soon
on
one
such
law
passed
in
louisiana
it
requires
abortion
doctors
to
have
admitting
privileges
or
the
right
to
admit
patients
to
a
nearby
hospital
which
many
hospitals
do
not
allow
and
which
elsewhere
has
led
to
the
widespread
closure
of
clinics
in
the
supreme
court
struck
down
an
almost
identical
law
in
texas
saying
it
imposed
an
undue
burden
chief
justice
roberts
dissented
from
that
ruling
though
in
february
he
voted
to
temporarily
halt
the
law
in
louisiana
while
the
court
decided
whether
to
take
it
up
the
other
four
conservatives

to
uphold
