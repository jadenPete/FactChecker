how
close
does
the
ukraine
scandal
bring
donald
trump
to
impeachment
democrats
are
torn
the
president
may
have
abused
his
office
but
be
unimpeachable
each
trump
administration
scandal
is
different
but
the
questions
they
invite
are
the
same
has
another
president
done
something
similar
before
does
this
scandal
involve
a
breach
of
the
law
or
merely
of
norms
and
precedent
where
does
this
rank
on
the
trump-o-meter
with
fibbing
about
the
size
of
the
crowd
at
his
inauguration
at
one
end
and
obstruction
of
justice
at
the
other
finally
if
you
heard
that
a
president
had
done
something
but
you
were
not
told
which
president
how
would
you
judge
the
behaviour
if
donald
trump
did
indeed
put
pressure
on
the
president
of
ukraine
volodymyr
zelensky
to
produce
material
that
would
embarrass
a
political
rival
might
that
be
the
worst
trump
scandal
yet
as
max
boot
an
ex-republican
who
is
generally
a
reliable
guide
wrote
in
the
washington
post
or
is
it
not
even
worthy
of
comment
as
most
senate
republicans
seem
to
believe
at
least
in
their
public
statements
begin
with
what
we
know
in
august
the
government
of
ukraine
received
news
that
the
white
house
had
frozen
a
package
of
military
aid
to
the
value
of
m
this
was
unexpected
because
congress
had
already
appropriated
the
money
and
because
the
aid
supported
america's
interests
in
ukraine
which
are
to
see
a
country
that
is
as
peaceful
and
stable
as
possible
a
month
earlier
mr
trump
had
spoken
to
ukraine's
newly
elected
president
to
congratulate
him
on
his
election
win
something
said
by
mr
trump
in
that
call
reportedly
gave
rise
to
a
formal
complaint
from
a
whistleblower
in
america's
intelligence
services
we
do
not
know
for
sure
what
that
something
was
but
the
wall
street
journal
has
reported
that
mr
trump
asked
mr
zelensky
about
eight
times
during
the
call
to
investigate
hunter
biden
the
son
of
the
democratic
front
runner
for
the
presidential
nomination
who
had
business
interests
in
ukraine
mr
trump
has
recently
admitted
that
he
raised
the
issue
of
corruption
with
mr
zelensky
the
contents
of
that
call
were
probably
part
of
the
whistleblower's
complaint
which
itself
is
now
at
the
centre
of
a
wrangle
between
the
white
house
and
congress
the
law
states
that
such
reports
are
passed
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
to
congress
the
trump
administration
is
arguing
that
the
law
has
been
incorrectly
applied
and
that
in
any
case
the
president's
calls
with
foreign
leaders
should
enjoy
executive
privilege
the
administration
may
offer
a
compromise
of
sorts
by
releasing
the
transcript
of
the
call
but
not
the
whole
of
the
whistleblower's
report
that
would
not
clear
the
matter
up
so
far
most
of
the
focus
in
the
american
press
has
been
on
the
contents
of
that
one
phone
call
was
the
freezing
of
the
money
explicitly
linked
to
the
investigation
of
hunter
biden
probably
not
the
economist's
reporting
suggests
that
the
call
was
characteristically
trumpian
but
that
there
is
no
smoking
gun
in
the
transcript
a
former
lawyer
to
the
president
michael
cohen
has
spoken
of
how
he
often
makes
his
wishes
plain
without
making
explicit
requests
or
orders
from
the
ukrainian
perspective
the
main
channel
through
which
mr
trump
applied
pressure
to
help
him
out
politically
was
via
his
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
shortly
after
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
mr
giuliani
travelled
to
madrid
to
meet
an
adviser
to
mr
zelensky
andriy
yermak
he
urged
the
ukrainian
government
to
investigate
the
younger
mr
biden
and
dangled
the
possibility
of
a
state
visit
to
washington
dc
as
an
inducement
mr
giuliani
has
since
said
that
he
was
acting
merely
in
his
role
as
the
president's
private
lawyer
but
this
distinction
if
it
existed
was
lost
on
the
ukrainian
government
the
reason
this
scandal
rises
above
the
level
of
mr
trump's
others
is
that
on
the
face
of
it
the
president
appears
to
have
acted
against
america's
national
interest
by
freezing
aid
to
a
vulnerable
ally
in
order
to
pursue
a
vendetta
against
a
political
rival
at
home
if
the
administration
suggested
that
the
military
aid
would
come
if
ukraine's
government
investigated
the
younger
mr
biden
if
you
give
us
the
dirt
we
give
you
the
guns
that
would
be
tantamount
to
extortion
even
without
such
an
explicit
assurance
it
looks
as
if
the
president
failed
to
put
america
first
and
also
used
taxpayers
money
to
put
pressure
on
a
foreign
government
to
produce
material
that
would
help
his
re-election
campaign
if
in
barack
obama
had
given
the
government
of
azerbaijan
the
impression
that
american
aid
was
contingent
on
digging
up
dirt
on
mr
trump's
property
deals
there
would
that
have
been
a
betrayal
of
the
trust
that
america
put
in
him
yes
it
would
that
is
why
more
democratic
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
are
now
talking
about
impeachment
there
are
three
groups
the
convinced
impeachers
who
have
argued
for
getting
rid
of
mr
trump
almost
from
day
one
the
house
leadership
which
believes
that
impeaching
mr
trump
in
the
house
and
then
seeing
him
acquitted
in
the
senate
where
republicans
have
a
majority
would
be
a
political
own-goal
and
the
reluctant
impeachers
who
are
willing
to
believe
that
impeachment
is
not
in
their
narrow
political
interests
but
believe
that
to
duck
impeachment
because
it
is
politically
inconvenient
would
be
to
shirk
the
role
the
founders
gave
to
congress
this
is
the
group
to
watch
closely
over
the
next
few
days
as
for
the
senate
the
numbers
lined
up
against
any
possible
impeachment
trial
are
still
stacked
in
mr
trump's
favour
the
hunter
biden
story
is
hugely
helpful
for
mr
trump
and
gives
republicans
another
genuine
scandal
to
talk
about
when
the
subject
of
ukraine
comes
up
because
that
the
vice-president's
son
who
does
not
know
a
great
deal
about
hydrocarbons
sat
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
drawing
a
salary
of
as
much
as
a
month
while
his
father
was
not
just
the
sitting
vice-president
but
was
responsible
for
the
white
house's
ukraine
policy
was
if
not
illegal
then
the
kind
of
misjudgment
that
only
seems
normal
for
those
who
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
cash-for-influence
industry
in
washington
dc
in
moral
terms
what
hunter
biden
did
or
did
not
do
in
ukraine
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
president
offered
the
president
of
ukraine
guns
for
oppo
research
in
political
terms
the
two
are
linked
that
leaves
american
politics
in
a
bind
the
president
may
have
abused
his
office
yet
if
he
has
nothing
much
can
be
done
about
it
even
if
the
numbers
change
and
the
house
votes
to
impeach
mr
trump
would
probably
be
exonerated
in
the
senate
mr
trump
would
be
unimpeachable
the
glimmer
of
light
is
that
the
scrutiny
mr
trump
is
being
subjected
to
now
over
his
dealings
with
ukraine
might
make
him
think
twice
about
doing
something
similar
in
the
future
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
