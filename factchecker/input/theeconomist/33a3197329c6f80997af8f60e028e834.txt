hotshots
and
global
warming
in
alaska
a
few
thousand
wildfire
fighters
stand
between
america
and
a
terrible
reckoning
the
wildfire
is
half
a
mile
away
with
nothing
between
it
and
tim
hatfield's
fireline
except
flammable
spruce
trees
high
in
the
alaskan
arctic
smoke
fills
the
southern
horizon
stirred
by
a
light
southwesterly
breeze
that
is
a
source
of
irritation
to
the
year-old
chief
firefighter
he
is
anxious
to
complete
the
five-mile
defensive
buffer
he
and
his
firefighters
are
carving
into
the
boreal
forest
to
stop
fire
which
has
consumed
acres
since
it
was
started
by
a
lightning
strike
three
weeks
ago
that
would
entail
widening
the
fireline
by
burning
a
strip
of
forest
on
its
southern
edge
yet
in
these
winds
and
alaska's
record
high
temperatures
a
controlled
burn
could
get
out
of
hand
it
could
burn
the
patches
of
forest
owned
by
the
local
neetsaii
gwich'in
indians
that
mr
hatfield
and
his
team
have
been
dispatched
by
helicopter
and
boat
to
protect
under
the
terms
of
the
government's
settlement
with
the
tribe
you
have
to
be
patient
with
fire
he
says
sometimes
that's
the
hardest
thing
while
american
politicians
engage
in
a
hot
and
unproductive
debate
about
global
warming
the
country's
federal
wildfire
fighters
and
more
employed
by
state
and
local
agencies
are
fighting
it
every
day
hotter
drier
conditions
have
sent
the
natural
fire
cycle
on
which
the
forests
and
grasslands
of
alaska
and
the
western
states
depend
into
a
tailspin
the
wildfire
season
is
days
longer
than
it
was
five
decades
ago
in
california
which
last
year
saw
its
deadliest
and
two
biggest
wildfires
it
is
year-round
nowhere
is
the
fiery
new
normal
more
obvious
than
in
alaska
which
is
largely
forested
and
warming
at
twice
the
global
rate
of
the
m
acres
of
american
forest
incinerated
in
a
new
annual
record
over
half
were
in
the
northernmost
state
and
while
the
fire
season
in
the
lower
has
got
off
to
a
relatively
slow
start
this
year
alaska
is
again
ablaze
it
has
lost
over
m
acres
of
forest
so
far
this
puts
mr
hatfield
and
his
team
on
the
front
line
of
a
struggle
in
which
more
than
america's
forests
the
fourth
most
extensive
of
any
country's
are
at
stake
the
firefighters
represent
a
prominent
test
of
america's
effort
to
adapt
to
global
warming
and
in
the
process
some
hope
bring
sanity
to
the
political
debate
as
climate-change
pioneers
they
might
not
seem
all
that
impressive
bearded
and
intensely
grimy
after
days
of
work
and
sleep
in
smoke
and
dirt
mr
hatfield
inspects
the
arrow-straight
ride
the
firefighters
have
cut
with
chainsaws
and
pulaskis
a
cross
between
an
axe
and
an
adze
used
in
american
wildfire
fighting
for
almost
a
century
given
the
fire's
remoteness
and
low
priority
it
threatens
no
city
or
significant
installation
there
is
no
less
arduous
way
slouching
through
the
forest
in
his
filthy
uniform
of
yellow
shirt
and
green
combat
trousers
while
recalculating
wind
humidity
and
temperature
mr
hatfield
recalls
one
of
the
original
pioneers
an
impression
reinforced
by
the
all-american
miscellany
he
meets
along
the
fireline
first
a
man
crew
of
gwich'in
irregulars
struggling
with
a
water-pump
next
some
elite
hotshot
firefighters
from
oregon
leaning
on
their
pulaskis
they
call
me
first-gear
one
says
cause
i
don't
go
fast
but
i
never
stop
a
nearby
spruce
whooshes
into
flame
sparked
by
embers
from
an
earlier
aborted
effort
to
widen
the
line
mr
hatfield
ignores
it
the
diversity
of
his
team
in
fact
reflects
the
efficiency
of
america's
emergency
response
system
within
hours
of
the
national
interagency
fire
centre
in
boise
idaho
receiving
a
call
for
help
it
can
dispatch
one
or
more
of
the
hotshot
crews
employed
by
federal
agencies
and
state
and
county
governments
it
is
also
a
tribute
to
the
spirit
of
the
firefighters
of
which
there
were
further
illustrations
around
the
campfire
where
mr
hatfield
and
his
deputies
including
another
alaskan
a
californian
washingtonian
and
more
oregonians
gathered
to
grill
hot
dogs
and
steaks
on
sharpened
sticks
wildfire
fighters
are
an
unusual
lot
at
once
dedicated
and
free-spirited
many
are
drawn
to
working
long
hours
for
six
months
in
order
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
year
hunting
or
skiing
and
for
most
of
us
just
being
in
the
woods
is
huge
said
brita
west
an
alaskan
and
rare
female
firefighter
yet
the
stresses
of
the
new
normal
are
taking
a
toll
wildfire
fighters
are
racking
up
twice
as
much
overtime
as
they
were
a
few
years
ago
in
part
because
there
are
fewer
of
them
the
number
of
federal
firefighters
has
fallen
by
over
that
is
a
result
of
cost-cutting
and
also
increased
competition
for
free
spirits
from
fracking
and
other
extractive
industries
in
the
western
states
more
hazardous
infernos
are
another
disincentive
almost
wildlife
firefighters
have
perished
in
the
past
decade
america
is
therefore
starting
to
run
short
of
some
of
its
most
heroic
public
servants
even
as
its
need
for
them
soars
areas
formerly
prioritised
for
protection
including
native
american
forest
are
being
abandoned
in
times
of
high
activity
and
there
will
be
more
of
these
climate
models
augur
a
huge
increase
in
wildfires
frequency
and
range
yet
with
many
politicians
on
the
right
denying
the
reality
of
global
warming
no
government
or
agency
has
made
a
serious
effort
to
model
what
firefighting
resources
will
be
needed
to
defend
what
areas
and
at
what
cost
there
are
two
big
cautionary
lessons
here
one
is
that
beyond
the
dysfunction
in
washington
the
excellence
of
america's
institutions
is
creating
a
false
sense
of
security
about
the
long-term
threats
its
politicians
are
neglecting
that
is
starkly
true
of
america's
early
efforts
to
adapt
to
global
warming
but
much
the
same
could
be
said
for
its
armed
forces
diplomatic
service
judiciary
and
other
institutional
crutches
against
manifold
threats
this
is
not
sustainable
without
better
leadership
there
will
be
a
reckoning
the
second
lesson
given
how
little
public
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
wildfires
is
that
there
is
little
reason
to
think
increased
natural
disasters
alone
will
produce
the
necessary
leadership
many
americans
and
by
extension
their
politicians
are
already
becoming
inured
to
global
warming's
devastating
effects
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
