the
last
man
to
have
built
mount
rushmore
nick
clifford
still
works
at
the
monument
it
was
the
dust
that
he
hated
most
clouds
in
the
high
thin
south
dakotan
air
that
choked
him
as
he
dangled
in
a
harness
on
the
mountainside
the
men
wielded
jackhammers
drilling
holes
so
sticks
of
dynamite
could
be
pressed
into
the
rock
then
as
they
retreated
on
a
president's
head
for
a
lunch
of
meatloaf
sandwiches
if
lucky
fuses
fizzed
and
granite
blasted
off
below
few
bothered
with
masks
except
when
the
boss
gutzon
borglum
came
on
site
one
man
snipped
a
hole
in
his
to
let
him
smoke
as
he
drilled
in
any
case
the
damned
particles
got
into
your
eyes
ears
hair
nose
and
worst
of
all
your
throat
from
to
nick
clifford
was
on
mount
rushmore
first
as
dogsbody
and
wood-chopper
then
as
labourer
and
winchman
signed
up
before
he
was
a
man
he
suspected
they
sought
out
his
baseball
skills
the
chief's
son
loved
the
game
and
his
weekend
team
needed
a
pitcher
in
the
week
he
enjoyed
winching
best
for
that
you
perched
on
one
or
other
president's
skull
taking
in
a
grand
view
of
the
black
hills
and
moved
others
harnesses
into
place
hourly
pay
was
good
for
the
tail
end
of
the
depression
cents
rising
to
a
heady
for
a
skilled
sculptor
work
stopped
in
winter
no
one
got
overtime
some
men
were
on
site
at
some
point
or
other
from
to
they
blasted
tons
of
granite
so
the
sculptors
could
reveal
the
four
presidents
within
remarkably
no
one
was
killed
despite
explosions
twice
daily
dropped
tools
accidents
with
winches
and
one
terrifying
time
when
the
bucket
a
contraption
that
hoisted
men
and
gear
to
the
mountain
top
hurtled
unrestrained
back
to
earth
a
few
died
fairly
soon
afterwards
the
wife
of
one
worker
suspected
silicosis
perhaps
worsened
by
heavy
smoking
habits
mr
clifford
didn't
light
up
at
the
last
surviving
worker
remains
relatively
hale
and
won't
retire
three
days
each
week
he
attends
to
visitors
at
the
monument's
gift
shop
always
in
blue
denim
shirt
and
pale
baseball
cap
he
poses
for
photographs
although
carolyn
his
wife
confides
he
hates
cameras
i
couldn't
be
better
he
says
but
he
declines
even
handshakes
from
children
or
much
conversation
the
inquisitive
are
told
all
their
questions
have
already
been
answered
in
his
book
on
sale
for
it
includes
a
baseball
card
most
wonder
about
prosaic
matters
was
it
hard
toil
yes
was
he
scared
swaying
in
the
wind
by
lincoln's
beard
or
teddy
roosevelt's
chin
no
but
he
was
young
and
less
thoughtful
did
it
get
unbearably
cold
never
enough
to
need
long
underwear
to
those
curious
about
his
place
in
history
he
says
little
would
he
liken
himself
to
those
who
laboured
at
stonehenge
the
pyramids
or
china's
great
wall
he
hasn't
considered
it
a
ranger
addresses
one
topic
he
neglects
mount
rushmore
arguably
produces
the
greatest
returns
of
any
public
project
he
tells
a
small
crowd
the
grand
scheme
finished
under-budget
and
earlier
than
many
expected
it
cost
less
than
m
in
s
money
and
even
posted
back
a
surplus
to
the
federal
government
the
site
now
draws
m
tourists
yearly
quite
a
boon
in
a
rural
spot
visitors
may
come
for
centuries
yet
after
the
dust
settled
mr
clifford
and
his
fellow
workers
left
a
towering
legacy
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
