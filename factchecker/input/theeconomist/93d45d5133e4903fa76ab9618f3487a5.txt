alabama's
lawmakers
want
to
challenge
roe
v
wade
that
seems
unlikely
to
happen
until
at
the
earliest
never
has
the
war
sparked
by
roe
v
wade
the
supreme
court
ruling
that
declared
abortion
a
constitutional
right
been
as
intense
as
it
is
now
lawmakers
in
conservative
states
are
passing
heartbeat
bills
banning
abortion
from
the
moment
a
heartbeat
is
detectable
around
the
sixth
week
of
pregnancy
flagrantly
violating
roe
to
defend
abortion
rights
some
liberal
states
are
extending
them
making
it
easier
to
have
abortions
in
the
third
trimester
that
has
encouraged
president
donald
trump
to
mount
a
fresh
assault
on
late
abortions
which
he
routinely
characterises
as
babies
being
ripped
from
their
mothers
wombs
the
most
uncompromising
attack
on
roe
has
been
launched
in
alabama
on
may
th
the
state's
senate
passed
a
bill
that
would
in
effect
ban
abortion
outright
signed
into
law
by
the
governor
the
following
day
it
constitutes
the
harshest
abortion
legislation
passed
in
america
in
half
a
century
the
heartbeat
bills
don't
really
tackle
what
roe
is
about
says
eric
johnston
president
of
the
alabama
pro-life
coalition
alluding
to
roe's
protection
of
abortion
until
a
fetus
is
viable
at
around
weeks
it
seemed
like
the
right
time
to
challenge
it
properly
the
bill
which
the
softly
spoken
mr
johnston
wrote
does
not
mess
around
comparing
abortion
to
the
most
murderous
atrocities
of
the
th
century
german
death
camps
chinese
purges
stalin's
gulags
cambodian
killing
fields
and
the
rwandan
genocide
it
makes
performing
one
a
felony
punishable
by
up
to
years
in
prison
because
the
bill
defines
a
fetus
as
a
human
being
regardless
of
viability
its
sponsors
resisted
attempts
by
republican
as
well
as
democratic
senators
to
allow
exceptions
in
cases
of
rape
or
incest
the
law
will
be
struck
down
in
the
courts
just
as
heartbeat
bills
have
been
elsewhere
most
recently
in
kentucky
and
iowa
similar
laws
passed
earlier
this
year
in
mississippi
and
in
georgia
will
meet
the
same
fate
as
will
several
more
making
their
way
through
state
legislatures
if
they
become
law
that
is
the
purpose
of
extreme
abortion
laws
to
prompt
legal
cases
in
the
hope
that
one
might
come
before
the
new
conservative
majority
at
the
supreme
court
which
will
use
it
to
overturn
roe
until
recently
anti-abortionists
were
engaged
in
a
stealthier
battle
rather
than
challenging
roe
directly
they
chiselled
away
introducing
state-level
regulations
so
burdensome
that
clinics
were
forced
to
close
as
social
conservatives
retreated
in
the
culture
war
over
gay
marriage
they
advanced
over
abortion
between
and
more
than
abortion
restrictions
were
introduced
across
america
more
than
a
third
of
the
total
since
according
to
the
guttmacher
institute
eight
states
have
only
one
abortion
clinic
left
mr
trump's
appointment
of
two
conservative
supreme
court
justices
has
emboldened
some
pro-lifers
to
adopt
a
more
aggressive
strategy
their
hopes
of
directly
overturning
roe
were
boosted
on
may
th
when
the
justices
voted
along
ideological
lines
to
overturn
a
year-old
precedent
in
a
case
unrelated
to
abortion
the
move
wrote
stephen
breyer
one
of
the
liberal
justices
can
only
cause
one
to
wonder
which
cases
the
court
will
overrule
next
lest
anyone
wondered
what
sort
of
case
he
had
in
mind
he
cited
planned
parenthood
v
casey
a
ruling
from
that
upheld
roe
some
pro-life
activists
are
cautious
about
the
prospects
of
overturning
roe
clarke
forsythe
senior
lawyer
for
americans
united
for
life
which
has
drawn
up
successful
state-level
abortion
regulations
says
his
organisation
watches
carefully
every
time
the
court
overturns
a
precedent
it
happens
more
often
than
many
imagine
but
he
also
points
out
that
the
court
and
in
particular
chief
justice
john
roberts
seem
in
no
hurry
to
overturn
roe
he
does
not
expect
the
justices
to
take
on
a
direct
challenge
for
two
or
three
years
that
is
probably
right
casting
himself
as
a
pro-life
warrior
is
useful
for
mr
trump
who
needs
to
keep
the
support
of
conservative
evangelicals
in
but
actually
overturning
roe
before
the
next
presidential
election
would
be
an
electoral
disaster
for
republicans
since
a
large
majority
of
americans
believe
abortions
should
be
legal
up
to
the
third
trimester
undermining
early
abortion
rights
can
be
risky
for
state
lawmakers
too
georgia
which
last
week
became
the
fourth
state
this
year
to
pass
a
heartbeat
bill
has
long
been
deeply
conservative
but
it
is
becoming
more
diverse
and
urban
as
the
inroads
made
by
democrats
in
november's
mid-terms
attest
a
recent
poll
found
that
more
voters
in
the
state
opposed
the
heartbeat
bill
than
supported
it
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
