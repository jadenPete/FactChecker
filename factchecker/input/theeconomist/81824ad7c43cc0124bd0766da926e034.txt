rules

the

will
stay
in

until
all
appeals
are
exhausted
like
weeds
and
superheroes
the
affordable
care
act
aca
is
hard
to
kill
since
storming
congress
in
republicans
have
tried
their
darndest
to
take
down
the
aca
better
known
as
obamacare
only
to
find
themselves
stymied
by
internal
divisions
over
what
would
replace
it
on
december
th
a
federal
judge
in
texas
dealt
the
law
what
many
in
the
party
hope
will
be
a
fatal
blow
but
as
green-fingered
hobbyists
and
the
green
goblin
know
in
equal
measure
it
is
unlikely
to
be
so
simple
the
issue
is
over
a
legal
technicality
known
as
severability
what
happens
to
a
law
if
part
of
it
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional
or
unenforceable
as
originally
passed
the
aca
included
a
requirement
for
all
americans
to
obtain
health
insurance
or
pay
a
penalty
known
as
the
individual
mandate
when
the
supreme
court
was
asked
to
weigh
in
on
the
law's
constitutionality
in
it
held
that
this
was
a
legitimate
exercise
of
congress's
power
to
tax
but
as
part
of
their
tax-cut
bill
in
republicans
reduced
this
penalty
to
zero
killing
the
individual
mandate
republican
officials
from
states
then
sued
the
federal
government
arguing
that
without
the
mandate
the
entire
law
based
as
it
was
on
congress's
taxing
powers
should
be
struck
down
as
unconstitutional
for
many
constitutional-law
experts
including
libertarian
ones
who
do
not
much
like
obamacare
this
argument
was
frivolous
reed
o'connor
a
federal
judge
appointed
by
george
w.
bush
took
it
seriously
he
wrote
that
because
rewriting
the
aca
without
its
essential
feature
is
beyond
the
power
of
his
court
the
individual
mandate
was
inseparable
from
the
rest
of
the
law
all
of
which
would
need
to
be
dismantled
the
department
of
justice
declined
to
defend
the
law
leaving
the
task
to
democratic
state
attorneys-general
they
are
sure
to
appeal
until
these
efforts
are
exhausted
the
law
will
remain
in
force
if
the
ruling
were
to
stand
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
when
the
supreme
court
considered
the
law
obamacare
was
not
yet
fully
in
effect
today
it
is
embedded
in
american
society
compulsory
coverage
of
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
would
disappear
young

find
themselves

the

health-insurance
programme

the

would
be
undone
overnight
at
least
m
who
gained
coverage
would
lose
it
states
like
ohio
and
kentucky
that
are
heavily
reliant
on
medicaid
dollars
to
pay
for
counselling
and
treatment
for
those
addicted
to
opioids
would
also
be
dealt
a
blow
since
obamacare
went
into
effect
the
share
of
americans
without
health
insurance
has
dropped
from
to
the
decline
was
even
steeper
in
states
that
chose
to
expand
their
medicaid
programmes
without
the
aca
and
with
a
sensible
replacement
unlikely
to
pass
through
a
divided
congress
this
progress
would
reverse
an
appeals
court
is
likely
to
overturn
judge
o'connor's
ruling
even
for
republicans
that
would
probably
be
the
best
outcome
in
the
recent
mid-term
elections
the
party
was
pummelled
by
voters
nervous
about
health-care
costs
and
the
possible
evaporation
of
protections
for
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
having
just
demolished
those
protections
republicans
would
struggle
to
run
as
the
party
defending
people
with
such
conditions
americans
have
a
conflicted
relationship
with
facts
at
the
moment
but
even
the
most
partisan
voters
might
recoil
at
such
up-is-downism
