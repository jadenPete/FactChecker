why
some
american
states
are
locking
up
toddlers
it
is
probably
better
than
separating
mothers
and
children
like
many
people
in
prison
ada
lynn
listens
more
than
she
speaks
spends
most
of
her
time
with
people
she
knows
best
and
is
deeply
wary
of
strangers
in
fact
when
she
sees
one
she
tends
to
burst
into
tears
because
unlike
most
people
in
prison
she
is
ten
months
old

homicide
washington
is
one
of
just
a
few
states
that
offer
residential
nurseries
for
women
who
give
birth
while
behind
bars
ms
myers
loves
the
programme
this
is
the
best
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
me
she
says
i
always
thought
i'd
never
be
a
functional
person
because
i
dug
myself
into
such
a
hole
but
here
i'm
figuring
out
who
i
am
with
my
daughter
not
everyone
shares
her
optimism
carolyn
sufrin
a
professor
at
johns
hopkins
university
worries
about
the
effects
on
children's
development
prison
is
prison
no
matter
how
prettily
the
nurseries
are
decorated
others
believe
that
the
programmes
would
not
survive
a
court
challenge
brought
on
behalf
of
a
baby
imprisoned
without
due
process
according
to
the
bureau
of
justice
women
were
behind
bars
in
of
them
in
state
prisons
jails
contain
people
awaiting
trial
or
serving
short
sentences
whereas
prisons
house
people
convicted
of
more
serious
crimes
that
is
around
one-tenth
the
total
number
of
people
incarcerated
but
it
is
nearly
ten
times
as
many
women
as
were
locked
up
in
as
the
number
of
convicts
in
america
has
fallen
since
in
most
states
the
female
prison
population
has
either
continued
to
grow
or
declined
more
slowly
than
the
male
population
according
to
dr
sufrin's
study
as
of
december
of
newly
admitted
women
prisoners
were
pregnant
in
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
states
must
provide
health
care
for
prisoners
but
what
that
means
in
practice
varies
particularly
for
pregnant
women
they
are
sometimes
shackled
while
giving
birth
a
practice
that
often
continues
according
to
amy
fettig
a
lawyer
with
the
american
civil
liberties
union
even
after
states
outlaw
it
new
york
opened
the
first
prison
nursery
in
today
states
have
them
admission
rules
vary
but
in
general
women
convicted
of
child-related
or
violent
crimes
are
ineligible
as
are
women
with
behavioural
or
mental-health
problems
or
with
a
poor
disciplinary
record
in
prison
to
be
accepted
into
washington
state's
scheme
women
must
be
pregnant
at
the
time
of
their
imprisonment
and
have
less
than
months
to
serve
from
the
time
of
delivery
mothers
and
children
are
released
together
prison
nurseries
seem
to
be
the
best
of
several
bad
options
facing
pregnant
inmates
researchers
have
found
that
they
are
associated
with
lower
rates
of
reoffending
compared
with
women
forced
to
give
up
their
children
and
with
fewer
behavioural
and
disciplinary
problems
than
among
women
in
the
general
prison
population
but
whether
that
is
because
of
the
programmes
or
because
women
capable
of
complying
with
the
strictures
that
prison-nursery
programmes
impose
were
heading
down
the
right
path
anyway
is
unclear
that
raises
another
question
if
women
meet
these
conditions
what
are
they
doing
in
prison
wonders
dr
sufrin
i
think
it's
essential
to
find
ways
to
maintain
family
bonds
i
just
think
we
need
to
do
it
in
ways
that
don't
involve
barbed
wire
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
