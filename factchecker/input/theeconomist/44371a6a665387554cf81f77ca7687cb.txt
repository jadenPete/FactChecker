new
rules
in
california
could
reshape
the
gig
economy
firms
such
as
uber
and
lyft
may
have
to
treat
contractors
as
employees
in
a
jolt
to
california's
gig
economy
the
state's
lawmakers
approved
on
september
th
a
landmark
bill
ab
that
will
force
many
firms
to
classify
independent
contractors
as
employees
california's
governor
gavin
newsom
a
democrat
had
pushed
hard
for
the
change
as
he
argued
in
a
labour
day
op-ed
in
the
sacramento
bee
firms
must
no
longer
be
allowed
to
shirk
responsibility
and
should
cough
up
for
things
like
medical
benefits
unemployment
insurance
and
paid
sick
days
the
bill's
sponsor
democratic
assemblywoman
lorena
gonzalez
has
argued
it
will
help
workers
not
wall
street
and
their
get-rich-quick
ipos
whether
that
is
true
or
not
is
fiercely
debated
firms
that
rely
heavily
on
contract
workers
argue
that
a
requirement
to
treat
them
as
employees
will
put
many
out
of
work
the
bill's
authors
seemingly
admitted
as
much
inserting
dozens
of
exemptions
for
workers
including
accountants
architects
dentists
doctors
engineers
and
estate
agents
missing
from
the
exemptions
are
drivers
for
ride-sharing
firms
like
uber
and
lyft
since
the
bill's
authors
argue
the
ride-sharing
platforms
impose
rules
on
their
drivers
which
mean
that
they
are
not
truly
self-employed
only
a
small
fraction
of
lyft's
roughly
drivers
in
california
will
keep
working
if
the
law
takes
effect
as
expected
on
january
st
says
adrian
durbin
head
of
policy
communications
for
the
san
francisco-based
firm
some
experts
reckon
ride
fares
could
rise
by
as
much
as
demand
for
trips
could
therefore
slip
beyond
that
lyft
drivers
will
lose
the
ability
to
work
or
not
work
whenever
they
want
mr
durbin
notes
unions
such
as
teamsters
pressed
hard
for
the
legislation
which
promises
to
make
recruiting
members
easier
one
big
backer
of
the
bill
the
service

international
union
reckons
other
states
will
follow
suit
a
day
before
the
bill
passed
new
york's
governor
andrew
cuomo
a
democrat
lauded
california's
push
and
said
it
got
his
competitive
juices
flowing
democrats
running
for
president
who
have
endorsed
california's
bill
include
front-runners
such
as
kamala
harris
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
lyft
and
uber
have
lost
roughly
a
third
of
their
stockmarket
values
since
july
but
both
are
gearing
up
for
battle
the
firms
now
hope
to
strike
an
alternative
deal
with
unions
and
lawmakers
by
offering
drivers
certain
benefits
including
reimbursement
for
some
expenses
and
guaranteed
earnings
that
exceed
the
minimum
wage
should
that
fail
uber
for
its
part
reckons
it
may
still
manage
to
keep
its
drivers
as
contractors
in
a
conference
call
following
the
bill's
passage
uber's
top
lawyer
tony
west
said
the
idea
is
to
argue
in
court
that
its
main
business
is
being
a
technology
platform
that
distinction
could
waive
the
requirement
to
treat
drivers
as
employees
a
final
option
both
firms
say
is
to
gather
petition
signatures
to
kick-start
a
ballot
initiative
that
would
sidestep
california's
lawmakers
last
month
lyft
and
uber
each
put
m
into
a
joint
campaign
fund
for
that
effort
if
we
need
to
we'll
take
it
to
the
voters
says
lyft's
mr
durbin
uber
has
already
begun
to
hire
a
campaign
team
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
