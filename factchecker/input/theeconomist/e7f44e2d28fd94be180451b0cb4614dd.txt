pete
buttigieg
fuses
liberalism
and
tradition
this
is
a
natural
extension
of
his
marriage
newton's
third
law
of
motion
also
helps
predict
america's
presidential
succession
after
richard
nixon's
sleaze
voters
picked
a
georgian
sunday
school
teacher
who
promised
never
ever
to
lie
to
them
after
eight
years
of
interracial
progress
and
cool
intellectualism
from
barack
obama
they
chose
donald
trump
whoever
succeeds
him
is
liable
to
be
as
different
from
the
know-nothing
new
yorker
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
for
a
growing
number
of
excited
democrats
this
points
to
pete
buttigieg
the
year-old
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
is
the
anti-trump
of
the
moment
a
harvard
and
oxford
graduate
he
is
a
gifted
musician
linguist
and
scholar
he
is
also
unfailingly
genial
and
for
a
politician
almost
bashful
about
his
achievements
given
that
his
main
claim
to
the
presidency
which
he
only
recently
became
old
enough
to
occupy
is
his
experience
running
indiana's
fourth
biggest
city
he
might
seem
to
have
little
choice
even
so
at
a
packed
rally
in
brooklyn
this
week
the
gracious
way
he
referred
to
his
recent
rise
in
the
democratic
primary
pack
was
refreshing
the
diminutive
mayor
appearing
before
a
crowd
of
bearded
hipsters
in
his
regulation
shirtsleeves
and
tie
celebrated
the
fact
that
his
campaign
was
being
taken
seriously
he
did
not
spell
out
that
almost
unknown
three
months
ago
he
is
now
polling
in
third
place
in
iowa
and
pulling
in
as
much
cash
as
any
rival
except
bernie
sanders
after
his
launch
on
april
th
he
raised
a
million
dollars
in
four
hours
he
also
made
no
reference
to
his
accomplishments
though
another
emerged
at
the
rally
it
had
previously
transpired
after
he
was
approached
by
a
norwegian
television
crew
that
he
speaks
fair
norwegian
in
brooklyn
he
spoke
better
french
as
notre
dame
burned
he
assured
a
french
journalist
that
americans
partageons
la
douleur
mais
nous
remercions
aussi
de
ce
cadeau
la
civilisation
we
share
in
the
pain
but
we
also
thank
you
for
this
gift
to
civilisation
on
twitter
meanwhile
mr
trump
urged
the
french
to
get
hold
of
some
flying
water
tankers
american
voters
do
not
much
like
pointy-headed
francophones
yet
in
recompense
mr
buttigieg
offers
a
convincing
claim
to
public-spiritedness
and
decency
he
quit
a
job
with
mckinsey
to
seek
election
in
unglamorous
south
bend
a
city
of
best
known
for
a
studebaker
car
factory
that
closed
half
a
century
ago
and
served
as
a
naval
reserve
in
afghanistan
he
is
squeaky
clean
and
prone
to
moralise
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
alongside
his
youthfulness
and
relentless
futurism
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
honest
politics
that
revolves
around
the
word
again
he
says
he
sets
the
timeless
values
of
the
small-town
midwest
faith
family
community
and
a
love
of
fried
food
and
dogs
perhaps
not
since
bill
clinton
have
the
democrats
produced
an
intellectual
so
good
at
playing
the
regular
guy
moreover
where
mr
clinton's
skill
became
associated
with
his
intemperance
and
cynicism
mr
buttigieg's
underlines
the
most
significant
detail
of
his
candidacy
his
status
as
the
first
plausible
openly
gay
presidential
candidate
a
tacit
rebuke
to
mr
trump's
illiberalism
this
plays
a
contradictory
role
in
the
mayor's
campaign
it
is
in
a
sense
impressively
peripheral
that
mr
buttigieg
can
plausibly
offer
himself
as
the
candidate
of
restoring
honest
christian
values
as
jimmy
carter
did
shows
how
relaxed
americans
have
recently
become
about
sexuality
opinion
polls
suggest
they
are
readier
to
vote
for
a
gay
candidate
than
an
evangelical
christian
one
yet
mr
buttigieg's
openness
about
his
sexuality
ever
since
he
came
out
in
an
article
in
the
south
bend
tribune
before
his
re-election
in
is
at
the
same
time
central
to
his
appeal
it
has
earned
him
a
reputation
for
candour
integrity
and
courage
of
which
his
marriage
to
chasten
a
schoolteacher
who
is
by
far
the
most
prominent
political
spouse
in
the
primary
provides
a
constant
reminder
chasten
buttigieg
who
warmed
up
the
crowd
in
brooklyn
and
greeted
his
husband
to
the
stage
with
a
kiss
on
the
lips
is
by
turn
a
comic
sidekick
political
surrogate
and
personification
of
the
mayor's
old-school
values
this
is
consistent
with
mr
buttigieg's
broader
argument
that
democrats
need
to
reclaim
the
traditional
values
which
he
espouses
from
the
right
freedom
does
not
belong
to
just
one
political
party
he
said
in
his
launch
speech
a
liberal
scion
of
the
heartland
he
has
long
witnessed
democrats
ignore
that
truth
delight
themselves
with
socioeconomic
policy
on
which
he
has
hinted
at
pragmatism
but
said
little
and
lose
presenting
his
marriage
as
an
elusive
example
of
liberalism
fused
with
tradition
looks
like
a
promising
alternative
strategy
to
understand
why
recall
how
gay
marriage
proved
such
a
felicitous
exception
to
the
culture
wars
liberals
and
conservatives
alike
felt
their
values
were
vindicated
by
the
reform
mr
buttigieg's
campaign
can
be
viewed
as
an
effort
to
maximise
his
political
gain
from
that
niche
the
unusual
way
he
combines
freethinking
liberalism
with
punctilious
social
conformity
in
his
manners
religious
practice
and
otherwise
is
a
sort
of
extrapolation
of
it
a
feud
he
appears
to
be
trying
to
engineer
with
mike
pence
represents
another
bid
to
elevate
his
modest
record
in
south
bend
battling
potholes
and
derelict
housing
into
the
grander
fight
over
values
he
wants
to
the
evident
surprise
of
the
vice-president
who
backed
anti-gay
measures
while
governor
of
indiana
mr
buttigieg
refers
to
him
as
his
nemesis
this
could
be
the
making
of
a
spicy
vice-presidential
debate
it
also
deflects
attention
from
mr
trump
whose
provocations
mr
buttigieg
seems
keener
to
ignore
he
is
not
alone
in
that
beto
o'rourke
and
amy
klobuchar
are
also
reluctant
to
go
toe-to-toe
with
the
president
the
former
is
better-known
than
mayor
pete
the
latter
more
experienced
it
is
far
from
clear
that
he
can
emerge
from
the
democratic
pack
yet
the
early
interest
in
him
is
merited
mr
buttigieg
is
attuned
to
the
way
voters
actually
think
not
how
politicians
want
them
to
he
also
represents
great
liberal
progress
both
things
are
worth
celebrating
correction
may
th
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
described
mr
buttigieg
as
the
first
openly
gay
presidential
candidate
without
qualification
we
have
amended
that
description
in
view
of
fred
karger's
candidacy
in
the
republican
primary
mr
buttigieg
is
the
first
plausible
openly
gay
candidate
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist

re-elected
as

president
go

expect
