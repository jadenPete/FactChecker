foreign
policy
after
donald
trump
a
few
democrats
see
a
chance
for
a
brave
new
world
this
too
shall
pass
joe
biden
told
america's
allies
at
the
munich
security
conference
in
february
we
will
be
back
the
applause
he
received
reflects
a
longing
to
return
to
a
world
order
that
existed
before
president
donald
trump
started
swinging
his
wrecking
ball
now
that
mr
biden
vice-president
under
barack
obama
for
eight
years
has
entered
the
race
to
challenge
mr
trump
in
the
contest
has
acquired
a
foreign-policy
heavyweight
who
embodies
the
pre-trump
era
but
would
a
future
democratic
administration
simply
turn
the
clock
back
in
the
crowded
field
of
democratic
candidates
apart
from
mr
biden
only
senators
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
have
so
far
made
serious
forays
into
foreign
policy
still
those
efforts
and
stirrings
of
debate
among
activists
point
to
the
potential
for
a
future
american
foreign
policy
that
could
look
very
different
not
just
from
that
of
the
current
administration
but
also
from
the
consensus
that
prevailed
before
on
the
surface
the
thrust
of
the
democrats
approach
is
simple
reverse
much
of
what
mr
trump
has
done
jake
sullivan
who
was
an
adviser
to
hillary
clinton's
campaign
talks
of
a
back
to
basics
dimension
to
democrats
on
foreign
policy
value
alliances
stress
diplomacy
compared
with
domestic
policy
he
says
there
is
less
focus
on
new
ideas
democrats
would
take
america
back
into
the
paris
agreement
pressing
the
world
for
a
new
level
of
ambition
in
carbon-cutting
they
would
rejoin
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
though
some
may
want
to
set
conditions
for
lifting
sanctions
they
would
reassure
nato
allies
of
their
whole-hearted
commitment
they
would
not
reverse
mr
trump's
more
confrontational
approach
to
china
there
is
now
bipartisan
agreement
on
the
need
to
stand
up
to
the
rising
superpower
but
would
aim
to
work
in
a
more
collaborative
way
with
allies
mr
biden's
candidacy
will
draw
attention
to
the
foreign-policy
record
of
the
obama
administration
mr
biden
did
not
always
agree
with
his
boss
he
pressed
for
a
more
muscular
pushback
against
russia
including
arming
the
ukrainians
favoured
a
tougher
approach
to
china
opposed
the
surge
in
afghanistan
and
the
intervention
in
libya
but
broadly
he
supported
of
mr
obama's
policies
says
a
former
foreign-policy
adviser
as
president
mr
biden
would
be
internationalist
experienced
and
familiar
yet
there
are
rumbles
of
revisionism
in
the
party's
mainstream
mr
sullivan
and
ben
rhodes
another
senior
adviser
in
the
obama
administration
have
launched
national
security
action
a
ginger
group
to
attack
the
trump
administration's
reckless
policies
but
also
to
search
for
fresh
alternatives
a
number
of
voices
on
the
left
are
calling
for
a
more
radical
rethink
defending
the
rules
of
the
road
is
fine
but
it
won't
mobilise
anyone
believes
kate
kizer
policy
director
at
win
without
war
an
advocacy
group
post-trump
just
getting
back
to
business
as
usual
is
not
good
enough
she
says
some
on
the
left
want
to
reconceptualise
how
we
see
security
in
a
paper
published
last
month
by
the
centre
for
a
new
american
security
a
think-tank
she
argues
for
a
new
american
grand
strategy
driven
by
values
rather
than
military
muscle
and
involving
a
reorientation
of
national-security
spending
to
prioritise
human
needs
at
home
and
abroad
this
fits
with
a
broad
critique
of
american
policy
after
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
that
it
overreached
well-intentioned
moves
to
spread
democracy
became
counter-productive
involving
the
country
in
forever
wars
and
doing
enormous
collateral
damage
the
strategy
of
preserving
or
extending
american
dominance
around
the
world
is
increasingly
insolvent
concludes
peter
beinart
from
city
university
of
new
york
writing
in
the
atlantic
support
for
greater
restraint
is
gaining
ground
according
to
stephen
wertheim
a
historian
who
teaches
at
columbia
university
but
can
the
ideas
of
the
restrainers
as
he
calls
them
move
from
the
fringe
to
the
mainstream
three
reasons
suggest
this
might
be
more
than
mere
wishful
thinking
on
their
part
first
there
are
advocates
for
restraint
on
the
right
as
well
as
on
the
left
take
the
bill
passed
by
congress
to
end
america's
support
for
the
saudi-led
war
in
yemen
mr
trump
has
vetoed
the
resolution
which
was
energetically
championed
by
democrats
such
as
ro
khanna
in
the
house
and
mr
sanders
along
with
chris
murphy
in
the
senate
but
it
got
through
the
senate
because
it
also
had
support
from
several
republicans
including
the
bill's
libertarian-leaning
co-sponsor
mike
lee
from
utah
second
opinion
polls
suggest
there
is
fertile
ground
for
restrainers
ideas
to
flourish
a
survey
by
the
eurasia
group
foundation
found
a
big
gap
between
the
foreign-policy
experts
who
espouse
activism
and
the
wider
population
favouring
restraint
polling
by
the
chicago
council
on
global
affairs
shows
that
millennials
born
between
and
and
now
becoming
the
biggest
cohort
of
voters
take
a
more
modest
view
of
america's
role
in
the
world
than
baby-boomers
born
between
and
only
of
millennials
favour
increasing
defence
spending
and
support
maintaining
superior
military
power
worldwide
among
boomers
the
figures
are
and
respectively
the
third
reason
for
supposing
that
the
left's
foreign-policy
ideas
might
penetrate
the
democratic
mainstream
is
that
something
similar
has
already
happened
in
other
areas
such
as
medicare
for
all
we
need
to
stop
siloing
domestic
and
foreign
policy
says
matt
duss
mr
sanders's
adviser
on
foreign
affairs
one
promising
avenue
for
this
to
happen
is
an
attack
on
inequality
and
corruption
both
in
america
and
abroad
mr
sanders
said
in
a
well-crafted
speech
on
foreign
policy
last
october
the
struggle
for
democracy
is
bound
up
with
the
struggle
against
kleptocracy
and
corruption
mrs
warren
echoed
the
theme
in
an
article
in
foreign
affairs
urging
aggressive
promotion
of
transparency
around
the
world
treating
corruption
as
a
strategic
matter
offers
rich
pickings
for
policy
the
effort
could
begin
at
home
with
legislation
to
make
it
harder
to
launder
money
through
shell
companies
and
cash
property
deals
and
with
beefing
up
instruments
like
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act
america
would
then
be
in
a
strong
position
to
lead
a
fight
against
kleptocracy
around
the
world
identifying
tools
that
can
interrupt
the
corrupt
flows
of
money
that
empower
oligarchs
princes
and
china's
state-owned
enterprises
could
prove
popular
the
issue
of
corruption
is
unifying
the
world
more
than
anything
else
believes
tom
malinowski
a
congressman
who
sits
on
the
house
foreign-affairs
committee
tackling
it
he
says
may
be
one
way
america
gets
its
mojo
back
after
trump
another
favourite
theme
of
those
on
the
left
is
a
desire
to
see
greater
democratisation
of
foreign
policy-making
itself
a
domain
seen
as
excessively
controlled
by
an
establishment
clique
and
above
all
by
the
president
that
means
in
part
strengthening
congressional
scrutiny
something
that
has
begun
to
happen
with
democratic
control
of
the
house
but
it
also
means
welcoming
wider
participation
in
policy
debate
elizabeth
beavers
associate
policy
director
for
indivisible
which
cultivates
anti-trump
grassroots
movements
suggests
that
talking
about
democratising
foreign
policy
is
something
where
democrats
have
a
real
opportunity
grassroots
pressure
is
a
means
towards
the
objective
of
ending
wars
congress
has
put
down
a
marker
with
its
yemen
bill
ms
beavers
now
has
her
sights
on
the
authorisation
for
use
of
military
force
aumf
put
in
place
after
the
attacks
of
and
used
by
successive
presidents
to
facilitate
interventions
around
the
world
as
with
yemen
democrats
will
find
allies
among
restrainers
on
the
libertarian
right
rows
among
democrats
are
likely
for
example
over
military
spending
radicals
want
to
cut
it
mainstreamers
are
more
cautious
policy
towards
the
middle
east
and
israel
in
particular
could
also
prove
divisive
democrats
are
vulnerable
to
accusations
by
mr
trump
that
they
are
soft
on
defence
and
woolly
on
protecting
american
interests
republicans
stubbornly
outscore
democrats
when
it
comes
to
public
trust
to
protect
national
security
yet
some
democrats
are
keen
to
challenge
the
assumption
that
strength
has
to
be
demonstrated
by
spending
more
on
defence
and
a
willingness
to
use
military
force
we
have
an
opportunity
as
a
party
to
close
the
national-security
gap
insists
senator
murphy
we
have
to
talk
about
our
national-security
vision
so
far
most
of
the
democratic
presidential
contenders
prefer
to
talk
about
their
domestic
vision
yet
foreign
policy
will
creep
up
on
the
candidates
predicts
mr
wertheim
a
full-blown
debate
on
what
a
post-trump
foreign
policy
ought
to
look
like
would
be
healthy
it
could
also
prove
surprising
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
