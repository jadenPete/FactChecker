why
american
departments
are
sending
social
workers
to
answer
calls
two
studies
suggest
that
one
in
four
people
shot
dead
by
the
police
have
psychiatric
conditions
when
his
adult
son
began
suffering
an
acute
episode
of
mania
in
queens
new
york
ralph
called
although
he
tried
to
explain
over
the
phone
that
the
problem
was
a
mental-health
crisis
we
had
to
watch
as
a
small
army
of
police
took
down
my
son
like
he
was
a
terrorist
he
recalls
ralph's
son
panicked
but
was
co-operative
so
he
averted
a
situation
that
could
very
well
have
turned
lethal
others
are
not
so
lucky
since
june
emotionally
disturbed
people
have
died
at
the
hands
of
police
in
new
york
city
robust
numbers
on
what
proportion
of
those
shot
dead
by
the
police
are
suffering
from
a
mental
illness
are
hard
to
come
by
the
department
of
justice
is
supposed
to
collect
the
numbers
but
police
departments
are
not
obliged
to
share
them
two
studies
suggest
that
in
as
many
as
one
in
four
of
all
fatal
police
shootings
nationwide
the
victim
suffers
from
severe
psychiatric
problems
yet
most
police
officers
are
not
trained
to
deal
with
mentally
ill
people
few
are
even
warned
that
a
person
is
ill
before
they
arrive
on
the
scene
police
departments
around
the
country
are
coming
to
recognise
that
this
must
change
one
approach
that
is
gaining
ground
involves
getting
police
officers
and
social
workers
to
respond
to
emergency
calls
together
departments
that
use
these
co-response
teams
report
that
they
detain
fewer
people
and
take
fewer
disturbed
people
to
emergency
rooms
thereby
saving
money
they
may
also
shoot
fewer
of
the
citizens
they
are
sworn
to
protect
police
in
boston
denver
houston
minneapolis
and
los
angeles
have
either
launched
or
expanded
such
teams
in
recent
years
new
york
started
its
own
co-response
programme
in
but
only
for
non-emergencies
in
light
of
stories
like
ralph's
the
city's
department
has
said
it
may
experiment
with
using
co-response
teams
to
handle
calls
getting
these
programmes
established
is
a
challenge
boston
embedded
its
first
social
worker
with
a
response
team
in
but
it
took
him
a
full
year
to
gain
the
trust
of
the
officers
says
jenna
savage
deputy
director
of
the
department's
office
of
research
and
development
police
officers
can
be
clubby
and
hostile
to
outsiders
funding
for
the
programme
was
also
patchy
cobbled
together
from
state
and
federal
grants
which
meant
that
boston
lost
a
clinician
when
a
grant
expired
but
the
programme's
benefits
persuaded
boston's
city
council
to
set
aside
permanent
funding
in
now
five
social
workers
accompany
officers
on
emergency
calls
and
ms
savage
would
love
to
hire
more
although
police
departments
speak
highly
of
these
teams
measuring
their
value
is
tricky
rigorous
research
demands
funds
that
cities
rarely
have
and
many
are
experimenting
with
slightly
different
models
which
makes
it
hard
to
compare
programmes
anecdotally
departments
cite
the
value
of
reduced
hospitalisation
and
jail
time
and
describe
better
community
relations
officials
in
gainesville
florida
recently
boasted
that
their
new
co-response
programme
has
diverted
over
of
those
who
would
have
gone
to
jail
elsewhere
thereby
saving
in
boston
where
a
cost-benefit
analysis
is
under
way
ms
savage
says
their
programme
saves
the
city
money
but
she
concedes
it
is
hard
to
quantify
services
that
have
been
avoided
and
these
programmes
are
only
as
good
as
the
mental-health
services
they
offer
if
a
co-responder
team
cannot
link
people
with
regular
case
workers
or
supportive
housing
they're
going
to
see
the
same
people
over
and
over
again
says
amy
watson
an
expert
in
criminal
justice
and
mental-health
systems
at
the
university
of
illinois
people
who
are
experiencing
a
psychiatric
crisis
often
call
because
they
lack
alternatives
in
new
york
city
emergency
calls
reporting
emotional
disturbances
have
nearly
doubled
over
the
past
decade
they
are
particularly
high
in
poorer
non-white
districts
where
opportunities
for
psychological
help
are
thin
on
the
ground
without
more
support
before
problems
become
emergencies
police
officers
are
doomed
to
manage
situations
that
are
better
left
