america's
coal
capital
knows
it
must
rethink
its
future
in
gillette
wyoming
many
people
see
a
liberal
conspiracy
at
work
rusty
bell
climbs
a
roadside
platform
and
gazes
at
the
sweeping
flower-strewn
landscape
of
northern
wyoming
immediately
before
him
is
a
vast
hole
eagle
butte
a
canyon
of
grey
and
brown
rock
is
one
of
the
largest
coal
mines
in
america
the
commissioner
of
campbell
county
calls
it
a
mainstay
of
the
economy
nearby
gillette
for
example
has
a
swanky
recreation
centre
decent
public-health
services
a
community
college
and
more
all
thanks
to
coal
revenues
he
says
mr
bell's
problem
is
that
nothing
moves
in
the
hole
yellow
lorries
on
the
valley
floor
look
tiny
and
toylike
in
the
distance
each
is
really
a
giant
able
to
haul
a
payload
of
tons
the
tyres
on
each
one
are
more
than
twice
the
height
of
a
tall
man
but
where
a
shift
of
workers
usually
toils
all
is
still
where
trains
miles
km
long
used
to
leave
from
the
mine's
edge
their
cars
brimming
with
low-sulphur
coal
nothing
stirs
buses
that
bring
tourists
a
year
to
the
mine
are
also
locked
out
the
operator
blackjewel
last
year
shipped
m
tons
from
eagle
butte
and
a
sister
mine
about
bn
tons
of
recoverable
coal
remain
under
the
prairie
grass
of
the
wider
powder
river
basin
in
theory
that
means
hundreds
of
years
of
digging
yet
but
in
july
blackjewel
declared
bankruptcy
chained
its
gates
and
sent
home
over
workers
nationally
including
in
wyoming
officials
and
residents
in
gillette
lament
horrible
incompetence
by
its
boss
the
mayor
louise
carter-king
blames
complete
mismanagement
vowing
that
these
mines
will
reopen
in
reality
blackjewel's
troubles
reflect
industry-wide
woes
cloud
peak
energy
runs
three
mines
nearby
and
declared
bankruptcy
in
may
six
wyoming
operators
have
done
so
since
some
are
consolidating
others
have
restructured
and
reopened
nonetheless
production
is
slumping
america
consumes
less
coal
than
at
its
peak
in
just
over
a
decade
ago
thermal
coal
produced
half
the
nation's
electricity
today
it
accounts
for
little
more
than
a
quarter
many
investors
are
abandoning
coal
the
only
real
uncertainty
is
when
digging
it
will
cease
to
be
a
significant
business
the
mayor
gamely
says
that
for
to
years
the
nation
will
still
need
coal
in
the
mix
others
say
longer
the
overall
trend
either
way
is
downwards
as
steeply
as
the
edges
of
eagle
butte
almost
a
century
ago
coal
miners
toiled
in
america
by
january
just
did
roughly
including
those
employed
indirectly
are
in
wyoming
many
in
campbell
county
they
are
highly
skilled
and
typically
earn
almost
a
year
double
the
state
average
but
power
utilities
increasingly
shun
what
they
produce
the
sierra
club
estimates
that
coal-fired
plants
survive
down
from
in
around
the
corner
from
eagle
butte
is
dry
fork
one
of
the
newest
coal-fired
stations
it
cost
bn
and
opened
in
talk
of
a
second
plant
came
to
nothing
utilities
prefer
cheaper
and
cleaner
natural
gas
solar
or
wind
power
academics
from
columbia
university
forecast
coal
consumption
crumbling
by
another
in
the
coming
decade
for
campbell
county
which
digs
two-fifths
of
america's
coal
that
may
be
the
best
it
can
hope
for
many
power
plants
now
mix
gas
with
coal
cutting
demand
if
other
energy
sources
get
cheaper
or
if
congressional
democrats
succeed
in
passing
laws
designed
to
limit
carbon
emissions
demand
will
fall
faster
some
in
wyoming
which
overwhelmingly
backed
donald
trump
in
see
a
liberal
conspiracy
against
coal
workers
and
their
hardscrabble
way
of
life
one
gillette
resident
says
proponents
of
clean
energy
are
set
on
direct
attacks
on
the
good
people
who
work
there
many
scoff
at
curbing
carbon
emissions
i'm
not
sold
that
the
ice
caps
are
melting
most
people
aren't
persuaded
by
climate
change
says
phil
christopherson
boss
of
a
group
trying
to
diversify
gillette's
economy
such
denial
helps
nobody
jim
ford
another
local
who
works
on
diversifying
the
local
economy
away
from
mining
concedes
there
is
widespread
distaste
for
carbon-flavoured
kilowatts
so
it
doesn't
matter
what
we
think
locals
also
know
that
exports
alone
won't
save
the
county
governors
of
western
coastal
states
refuse
to
let
their
ports
be
used
or
a
new
one
be
built
for
shipping
wyoming
coal
michael
von
flatern
a
state
senator
expects
we'll
be
headed
for
bust
more
often
than
boom
as
the
industry
slows
he
praises
efforts
to
test
how
to
burn
coal
cleanly
by
catching
emissions
but
says
we're
years
too
late
in
starting
such
experiments
mr
ford
describes
a
m
international
effort
at
dry
fork
to
extract
carbon
from
flue
gases
while
producing
marketable
products
from
it
some
local
firms
hope
to
use
coal
to
make
asphalt
carbon
fibre
or
water
filters
such
activities
so
far
are
small-bore
mr
von
flatern
thus
expects
tighter
belts
and
rising
property
taxes
to
come
because
residents
cannot
expect
taxes
on
minerals
oil
gas
and
some
uranium
are
also
extracted
to
keep
paying
for
of
all
the
county's
bills
wyoming
gets
an
estimated
m
a
year
in
royalties
and
fees
from
coal
miners
that
sum
is
starting
to
fall
the
mayor
talks
of
luring
firearm-makers
or
other
industries
to
use
gillette's
railway
roads
airport
energy
skilled
labour
and
water
she
notes
how
trade
shows
tourism
and
conferences
are
growing
we
know
we
need
to
diversify
but
it
takes
time
she
says
and
time
is
short
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
