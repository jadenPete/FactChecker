hospital
prices
are
now
public
that
is
unlikely
to
push
them
down
from
the
day
it
became
law
the
affordable
care
act
better
known
as
obamacare
has
been
a
party
pi
ata
for
the
republicans
they
keep
bashing
it
from
all
sides
trying
to
tear
it
apart
but
one
of
its
provisions
was
embraced
and
even
bolstered
by
the
trump
administration
as
of
january
st
hospitals
are
obliged
to
post
online
the
standard
charges
for
all
of
their
services
the
idea
is
in
theory
laudable
patients
who
are
otherwise
mostly
blind
as
to
what
their
care
will
cost
until
the
bill
arrives
would
shop
around
for
lower
prices
the
biggest
winners
at
first
would
be
the
roughly
of
americans
who
do
not
have
health
insurance
and
the
covered
by
cheap
plans
that
require
them
to
pay
substantial
amounts
towards
medical
bills
before
their
insurance
kicks
in
known
as
high-deductible
plans
as
patients
flock
to
competitors
who
charge
less
hospitals
would
cut
prices
to
win
them
back
bringing
america's
exorbitant
prices
closer
to
those
in
other
rich
countries
see
chart
in
reality
none
of
this
is
likely
to
happen
the
price
lists
that
are
being
published
are
of
little
practical
use
for
patients
each
private
insurer
negotiates
discounted
rates
with
each
hospital
in
contracts
that
usually
neither
side
is
allowed
to
make
public
an
analysis
of
payments
for
uncomplicated
births
in
california
in
for
example
found
that
discounted
prices
paid
by
insurers
were
on
average
of
hospitals
list
prices
uninsured
patients
who
are
most
likely
to
pay
the
list
prices
face
a
headscratcher
working
out
which
of
the
thousands
of
items
on
the
price
lists
with
descriptions
like
echo
tee
guid
tcat
icar
vessel
structural
intvn
might
apply
for
their
treatment
even
if
they
manage
to
nail
down
the
big-ticket
items
they
will
still
be
missing
a
major
portion
of
the
final
bill
because
the
rates
charged
by
physicians
radiologists
and
other
specialists
are
not
included
in
hospitals
lists
to
dispel
confusion
hospitals
are
posting
alongside
their
price
lists
disclaimers
and
videos
explaining
that
they
are
useless
the
predicament
of
patients
trying
to
get
an
idea
of
what
something
like
a
big
operation
might
cost
them
is
laid
bare
by
a
study
conducted
in
in
which
researchers
called
hospitals
posing
as
a
grand-daughter
looking
for
information
on
the
cash
price
of
hip
replacement
for
her
grandmother
only
eight
of
the
hospitals
were
able
to
provide
a
full
price
inclusive
of
physician
charges
were
unable
to
provide
any
estimate
nearby
hospitals
often
have
widely
different
list
prices
even
for
things
as
standard
as
an
x-ray
or
an
aspirin
tablet
might
some
hospitals
lower
prices
when
they
see
what
their
competitors
are
charging
that
too
seems
unlikely
most
states
already
require
hospitals
to
publish
some
of
their
prices
when
prices
become
public
they
may
go
up
not
down
says
renee
hsia
of
the
university
of
california
in
san
francisco
antitrust
textbooks
teach
that
transparency
can
push
up
prices
because
firms
know
that
discounting
might
trigger
an
immediate
price
war
rather
than
boost
their
market
share
america's
health
care
market
poses
particular
challenges
hospitals
set
prices
using
various
multipliers
and
formulas
that
are
often
outdated
and
not
linked
to
costs
or
quality
a
process
that
the
late
uwe
reinhardt
an
economist
at
princeton
university
once
described
as
chaos
behind
a
veil
of
secrecy
studies
of
people
in
high-deductible
plans
show
that
when
they
have
access
to
prices
they
reduce
their
use
of
services
but
do
not
pay
less
for
them
patients
usually
go
for
tests
to
wherever
their
doctors
refer
them
the
fallacy
of
pinning
hopes
on
policies
such
as
the
new
price-transparency
rule
is
that
patients
in
america
are
viewed
as
consumers
who
can
easily
shop
around
rather
than
people
who
are
unwell
and
under
duress
says
dr
hsia
but
knowing
in
advance
how
much
their
care
will
cost
would
be
a
step
forward
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
