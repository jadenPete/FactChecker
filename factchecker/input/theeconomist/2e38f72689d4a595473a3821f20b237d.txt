america's
next
attorney-general
looks
equipped
for
the
trials
ahead
william
barr
is
no
sheep
under
any
president
but
the
current
one
the
appointment
of
william
barr
as
attorney-general
would
be
uncontentious
the
year-old
conservative
lawyer
is
plainly
up
to
a
job
he
has
already
performed
ably
for
george
h.w.
bush
from
to
yet
the
strains
of
being
chief
law-enforcement
officer
to
donald
trump
are
of
a
different
order
and
there
were
indications
ahead
of
his
senate
confirmation
hearing
on
january
th
and
th
that
mr
barr
might
yield
to
them
the
most
alarming
was
his
view
expressed
last
year
in
an
unsolicited
memo
to
the
justice
department
that
robert
mueller
had
no
business
investigating
mr
trump
for
possible
obstruction
of
justice
based
on
mr
barr's
sketchy
understanding
of
the
special
counsel's
inquiry
into
mr
trump's
controversial
decision
to
sack
james
comey
as
fbi
director
he
described
mr
mueller's
obstruction
theory
as
fatally
misconceived
the
president
was
entitled
to
sack
mr
comey
he
argued
so
he
could
not
have
obstructed
justice
by
doing
so
this
was
a
dubious
argument
most
legal
scholars
think
that
if
mr
trump
fired
his
fbi
director
in
a
malign
effort
to
stop
him
investigating
the
russian
election-hacking
that
is
now
central
to
mr
mueller's
bigger
probe
it
could
constitute
obstruction
yet
mr
barr's
view
was
consistent
with
his
expansive
view
of
presidential
power
and
within
the
boundaries
of
reasonable
debate
the
question
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
was
therefore
whether
his
comments
represented
ill-informed
venting
by
a
casual
observer
or
a
more
serious
threat
to
mr
mueller's
investigation
his
testimony
pointed
to
the
former
with
qualifications
mr
barr
praised
mr
mueller
personally
describing
him
as
a
good
friend
and
said
he
would
be
allowed
to
complete
his
work
refining
his
view
he
also
acknowledged
instances
in
which
mr
trump
might
transgress
while
exercising
his
legal
powers
for
example
if
he
ended
the
mueller
probe
to
protect
himself
or
his
family
it
seems
safe
to
assume
mr
barr
whose
confirmation
looked
unstoppable
as
the
economist
went
to
press
will
not
meddle
with
the
investigation
that
makes
him
an
improvement
on
the
acting
attorney-general
matthew
whitaker
who
seems
to
have
fewer
qualms
in
some
ways
too
he
may
improve
on
the
policies
of
his
permanent
predecessor
jeff
sessions
mr
barr
appears
to
have
a
more
pragmatic
view
of
marijuana
policy
for
example
though
against
legalising
pot
he
said
he
would
not
enforce
a
federal
prohibition
in
states
that
have
done
so
as
mr
sessions
threatened
to
do
on
sentencing
and
policing
he
may
also
be
less
hardline
than
mr
sessions
though
mr
barr
broadly
shares
the
former
attorney-general's
tough
approach
and
focus
on
violent
crime
he
said
his
views
had
moderated
a
bit
he
pledged
to
implement
a
criminal-justice
reform
passed
by
congress
last
year
which
mr
sessions
hated
yet
mr
barr's
testimony
did
not
allay
another
mueller-related
concern
about
how
he
will
manage
the
crucial
endgame
of
the
special
counsel's
investigation
asked
whether
he
would
make
mr
mueller's
final
report
public
mr
barr
said
he
would
try
to
he
also
rejected
a
suggestion
by
the
president's
chief
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
that
the
white
house
could
rewrite
bits
of
it
that
will
not
happen
yet
he
noted
that
the
special-counsel
regulations
would
make
the
report
confidential
in
the
first
instance
that
is
correct
and
sections
touching
on
sensitive
national
security
matters
might
have
to
stay
under
wraps
yet
this
is
also
the
likely
means
by
which
mr
trump
citing
executive
privilege
will
try
to
limit
whatever
damage
he
faces
from
mr
mueller's
findings
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
wonder
whether
mr
barr
will
resist
or
abet
him
in
that
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
