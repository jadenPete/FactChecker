why
more
undocumented
migrants
are
reaching
america
donald
trump's
habit
of
insulting
mexicans
appears
to
have
backfired
donald
trump
promised
to
resort
to
untested
measures
to
keep
mexican
migrants
from
crossing
america's
southern
border
the
promise
contained
at
least
two
nagging
flaws
the
first
is
an
outdated
view
migration
of
mexicans
is
down
by
from
its
peak
in
now
most
border-hoppers
come
from
the
northern
triangle
of
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
the
second
error
was
to
rile
mexico
with
insults
and
threats
when
america
relies
on
its
goodwill
to
police
its
own
southern
border
which
migrants
must
first
cross
before
continuing
on
to
america
in
february
the
number
of
migrants
stopped
while
trying
to
enter
america
from
mexico
a
proxy
for
overall
illegal
migration
levels
rose
to
that
is
the
highest
number
for
any
month
in
a
decade
the
increase
consisted
almost
entirely
of
central
americans
not
mexicans
meanwhile
mexican
authorities
have
been
deporting
less
than
half
as
many
central
americans
as
usual
since
andr
s
manuel
l
pez
obrador
a
left-winger
took
office
in
december
mexico
deported
one
migrant
for
every
four
that
were
apprehended
in
america
in
the
year
before
he
took
office
now
the
ratio
is
closer
to
one
to
ten
that
is
no
coincidence
mr
l
pez
obrador's
team
vows
to
depart
from
the
mass
deportations
of
migrants
that
mexico
has
carried
out
since
at
america's
behest
in
january
confronted
with
a
caravan
of
migrants
from
honduras
mexico
handed
out
wristbands
which
doubled
as
a
humanitarian
visa
allowing
migrants
to
stroll
across
into
mexico
from
guatemala
without
fuss
mexico
plans
to
roll
out
a
plan
later
this
year
allowing
central
americans
to
obtain
humanitarian
visas
from
mexican
consulates
in
their
home
countries
that
will
allow
safer
journeys
mexico
is
not
doing
this
purely
to
upset
mr
trump
it
wants
to
reduce
the
bn
that
mexican
organised
crime
reaps
from
trafficking
migrants
each
year
olga
s
nchez
cordero
mexico's
secretary
of
the
interior
recently
told
diplomats
that
by
history
tradition
and
conviction
mexicans
are
a
people
in
solidarity
with
those
who
arrive
in
our
country
mr
l
pez
obrador
believes
that
money
is
better
spent
tackling
the
causes
of
migration
than
on
border
security
and
wants
america
to
spend
more
to
create
jobs
and
strengthen
the
rule
of
law
for
a
while
mr
trump's
harsh
rhetoric
seemed
to
deter
migrants
border
apprehensions
dropped
after
his
victory
in
november
before
any
policies
were
implemented
for
months
many
chose
to
delay
the
journey
north
but
that
has
not
lasted
mr
trump
has
little
to
show
for
his
efforts
to
build
a
wall
let
alone
make
mexico
pay
for
it
or
to
cut
aid
to
central
american
countries
that
fail
to
stop
their
citizens
emigrating
even
his
most
hard-hearted
policies
like
caging
children
or
removing
gang
and
domestic
violence
as
grounds
for
asylum
have
not
worked
for
a
sense
of
why
this
is
so
look
at
tapachula
a
tropical
town
near
mexico's
border
with
guatemala
tales
of
gang
threats
and
dead
relatives
abound
a
farmer
from
honduras
complains
of
plunging
coffee
prices
reduced
rainfall
and
insect
plagues
destroying
his
crops
many
migrants
wait
in
the
hot
sun
to
apply
for
asylum
mexico
received
nearly
requests
in
january
and
february
more
than
all
the
requests
in
and
combined
many
migrants
first
enter
mexico
via
the
nearby
town
of
ciudad
hidalgo
just
m
away
from
a
mexican
immigration
office
is
a
bustling
river
border
guatemalans
come
and
go
on
small
rafts
for
quetzals
a
trip
others
use
them
to
ferry
loo
paper
and
coca-cola
across
children
bathe
in
the
stream
migrants
tend
to
cross
to
mexico
at
dawn
but
they
do
not
need
to
law-enforcement
officers
are
a
rare
sight
even
as
mexico
applies
a
softer
touch
on
its
southern
border
it
is
co-operating
with
america
in
its
north
it
is
abiding
by
a
new
programme
that
requires
migrants
seeking
asylum
in
america
to
wait
in
mexico
while
their
court
date
approaches
but
diplomatic
goodwill
may
fade
if
central
americans
keep
streaming
through
mexico
like
water
as
mr
trump
tweeted
last
year
that
seems
likely
especially
now
that
regular
caravans
offer
migrants
the
chance
to
travel
in
the
safety
of
a
large
group
oddly
though
that
may
not
drive
mr
trump
to
despair
failing
to
reduce
central
american
migration
may
ultimately
be
more
useful
to
him
politically
than
succeeding
ever
could
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
