mlk
was
more
complicated
than
his
myth
but
can
documents
from
an
agency
that
hounded
king
be
trusted
in
oliver
stone
released
a
terrible
film
about
john
f.
kennedy's
assassination
filled
with
conspiracy
theories
about
government
involvement
despite
or
rather
because
of
its
awfulness
the
film
contributed
to
the
passage
of
the
snappily
named
president
john
f.
kennedy
assassination
records
collection
act
of
the
law
compelled
anything
related
to
the
assassination
to
be
released
years
after
its
passage
a
date
which
fell
in
october
the
definition
of
relevance
was
broad
which
meant
that
a
large
collection
of
fbi
records
from
the
s
was
made
public
if
only
you
knew
where
to
look
for
them
david
garrow
a
historian
who
has
published
a
pulitzer-winning
biography
of
martin
luther
king
bearing
the
cross
as
well
as
a
book
about
king
and
the
fbi
did
know
where
to
look
last
summer
he
spent
two
months
going
through
new
documents
including
summaries
of
transcripts
from
the
fbi's
stasi-like
surveillance
of
king's
private
life
the
fbi
managed
to
persuade
the
attorney-general
bobby
kennedy
that
king
had
links
with
communists
and
that
the
g-men
must
therefore
wiretap
his
phones
and
bug
any
rooms
he
stayed
in
the
agents
did
not
find
reds
under
the
bed
but
they
did
overhear
salacious
stuff
about
what
was
happening
on
top
of
the
mattress
the
agency
made
tapes
and
transcribed
them
summaries
of
those
transcripts
were
subsequently
made
which
included
quotations
from
the
transcripts
these
are
the
files
that
were
released
in
can
documents
made
by
an
agency
that
was
out
to
get
king
really
be
trusted
mr
garrow
thinks
so
and
points
to
a
report
from
the
justice
department
which
says
that
the
transcripts
accurately
reflect
what
is
on
the
tapes
king
who
was
married
had
a
lot
of
affairs
which
was
known
already
but
the
documents
describe
powerful
men
arranging
nights
of
sex
with
women
and
make
for
uncomfortable
reading
one
of
the
documents
has
a
note
scribbled
in
pencil
in
the
margin
saying
that
king
was
present
when
a
parishioner
was
raped
in
a
hotel
room
that
detail
is
the
most
controversial
of
mr
garrow's
findings
because
of
the
nature
of
the
allegation
and
because
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
describes
something
on
tape
the
fbi
tried
to
spread
this
information
around
washington
but
in
an
age
when
men
including
a
sitting
president
could
get
away
with
coercing
women
into
having
sex
there
was
little
take-up
the
agency
then
tried
a
more
direct
route
agents
made
a
tape
and
sent
it
to
king
with
an
anonymous
note
you
are
a
colossal
fraud
and
an
evil
vicious
one
at
that
the
letter
said
you
could
not
believe
in
god
and
act
as
you
do
the
letter
went
on
to
instruct
king
to
commit
suicide
or
the
tape
would
be
released
king
there
is
only
one
thing
left
for
you
to
do
you
know
what
it
is
by
any
standards
the
discovery
of
these
documents
by
a
reputable
historian
is
newsworthy
because
king
was
probably
the
greatest
american
of
the
th
century
yet
mr
garrow
says
he
could
not
interest
a
mainstream
outlet
in
publishing
his
findings
which
instead
came
out
in
standpoint
a
small
right-wing
british
magazine
the
tapes
themselves
will
be
declassified
in
at
which
point
people
will
be
able
to
hear
them
and
decide
for
themselves
correction
an
earlier
version
of
this
story
states
that
david
garrow
was
working
from
transcripts
of
the
fbi's
tape
in
fact
the
files
he
found
were
summaries
of
the
transcripts
which
included
quotations
from
them
this
was
corrected
on
june
th
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the

president
go

to
expect
