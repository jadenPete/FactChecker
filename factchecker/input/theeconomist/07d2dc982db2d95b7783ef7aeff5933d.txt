police
officers
and
border
patrol
agents
say
racist
sexist
things
what
to
do
about
that
we
serve
the
american
people
with
vigilance
integrity
and
professionalism
is
part
of
the
ethos
of
the
customs
and
border
protection
the
agency
charged
with
guarding
america's
borders
on
july
st
propublica
an
investigative
journalism
non-profit
exposed
a
private
facebook
group
of
current
and
former
border
patrol
agents
who
have
been
sharing
comments
about
migrants
and
misogynist
memes
about
latina
lawmakers
the
group
which
has
some
members
is
called
i'm
code
for
aliens
in
custody
one
commenter
mocked
a
year-old
migrant's
death
another
made
fun
of
a
man
carrying
his
child
in
a
plastic
bag
to
cross
a
river
at
least
it's
already
in
a
trash
bag
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
a
new
york
representative
who
has
called
detention
centres
concentration
camps
was
crudely
photoshopped
into
a
sex
act
with
a
migrant
and
being
sexually
assaulted
by
the
president
the
border
patrol
agents
are
not
the
only
law-enforcement
officials
who
have
been
busy
online
the
plain
view
project
launched
by
emily
baker-white
a
philadelphia
lawyer
looked
at
the
social-media
accounts
of
officers
and
retired
officers
from
eight
police
departments
including
philadelphia
dallas
phoenix
and
st
louis
it
reviewed
tens
of
thousands
of
posts
and
discovered
reams
of
racist
misogynistic
and
anti-islamic
imagery
and
memes
some
posts
referred
to
muslims
as
goat-humpers
and
savages
many
posters
bashed
immigrants
and
refugees
some
applauded
violence
and
glorified
police
brutality
one
phoenix
officer
declared
it
was
a
good
day
for
a
chokehold
a
dangerous
and
largely
forbidden
police
tactic
at
least
of
the
philadelphia
police
officers
in
the
database
are
in
command
positions
such
as
captains
inspectors
and
sergeants
the
officers
may
have
thought
they
were
posting
private
thoughts
but
chuck
wexler
head
of
the
police
executive
research
forum
a
research
and
policy
group
says
the
postings
are
a
st-century
version
of
conduct
unbecoming
a
police
officer
a
police
disciplinary
rule
that
has
been
upheld
by
state
and
lower
federal
courts
law-enforcement
officers
are
rightly
held
to
a
high
standard
a
cop
is
still
a
cop
even
when
not
in
uniform
says
david
thornburgh
of
the
committee
of
seventy
a
philadelphia
government
watchdog
jerry
ratcliffe
a
former
metropolitan
police
officer
in
london
and
now
head
of
the
centre
for
security
and
crime
science
at
temple
university
finds
the
officers
posts
abhorrent
but
worries
about
policing
policemen's
thoughts
are
we
going
to
fire
people
for
having
views
we
don't
like
some
of
the
posts
are
political
in
nature
and
are
opinions
held
by
a
lot
of
americans
including
the
president
social-media
training
is
unlikely
to
change
thinking
though
policy
may
change
superficially
to
satisfy
critics
it
is
already
difficult
to
recruit
high-quality
officers
says
eugene
o'donnell
of
john
jay
college
of
criminal
justice
some
departments
have
had
to
lower
academic
requirements
perhaps
too
far
ten
police
cadets
in
philadelphia
resigned
this
week
after
they
admitted
cheating
in
an
exam
richard
ross
philadelphia's
police
commissioner
put
of
the
philadelphia
officers
identified
by
the
database
on
administrative
leave
he
expects
some
to
be
fired
the
department
intends
to
develop
social-media
training
and
will
monitor
officers
accounts
in
the
future
he
has
asked
an
outside
law
firm
to
conduct
a
probe
to
determine
whether
the
posts
are
protected
under
the
constitution's
first
amendment
which
protects
free
speech
prosecutors
meanwhile
are
refusing
to
work
with
some
officers
larry
krasner
philadelphia's
district
attorney
says
he
is
reviewing
the
database
some
officers
may
no
longer
be
asked
to
testify
in
court
because
they
lack
credibility
he
wants
to
avoid
having
to
notify
defence
lawyers
of
any
evidence
that
could
help
their
clients
such
as
that
the
arresting
officer
would
appear
to
be
racist
about
philadelphia
officers
in
the
database
have
had
federal
civil-rights
cases
filed
or
settled
against
them
st
louis's
prosecutor
also
refuses
to
work
with
certain
officers
she
has
banned
from
bringing
cases
to
her
office
that
ultimately
may
be
the
best
incentive
for
officers
to
change
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the

just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the

new
term
