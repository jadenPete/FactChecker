a
deadly
outbreak
casts
a
dark
cloud
over
e-cigarettes
researchers
are
trying
to
understand
the
effects
of
illicit
black-market
cartridges
with
six
people
dead
and
more
than
suffering
from
serious
pulmonary
disease
across
america
doctors
and
federal
officials
are
trying
to
identify
the
cause
of
a
mystery
illness
tied
to
e-cigarettes
although
the
dead
have
largely
been
older
the
wider
outbreak
is
unusual
in
hitting
young
and
otherwise
healthy
people
a
recent
study
of
cases
in
illinois
and
wisconsin
found
the
median
age
was
just
much
of
the
investigatory
work
is
focused
on
agents
that
may
have
been
added
to
illicit
black-market
cartridges
containing
cannabis
extracts
on
september
th
health
officials
in
new
york
issued
subpoenas
to
firms
selling
thickening
agents
such
as
vitamin
e
used
in
black-market
vaping
products
then
on
september
th
the
trump
administration
announced
plans
to
ban
flavoured
vaping
products
although
the
centres
for
disease
control
cdc
has
recommended
that
people
should
stop
vaping
until
the
source
of
the
outbreak
is
identified
the
food
and
drug
administration
fda
has
issued
different
advice
the
fda
now
conducting
product
testing
to
work
out
the
source
of
the
problem
has
advised
consumers
to
avoid
buying
vaping
products
on
the
street
and
to
stop
vaping
with
products
containing
cannabis
this
warning
includes
products
bought
legally
in
states
that
allow
cannabis
to
be
sold
many
of
the
patients
have
similar
symptoms
daniel
fox
a
pulmonologist
with
wakemed
a
health-care
system
in
north
carolina
says
a
small
cluster
of
cases
in
his
state
had
symptoms
such
as
shortness
of
breath
nausea
vomiting
and
fever
all
had
consumed
cannabis
by
vaping
dr
fox
says
the
diagnosis
was
lipoid
pneumonia
a
rare
non-infectious
condition
that
occurs
when
oils
or
lipid-containing
substances
enter
the
lungs
the
finding
that
immune
cells
in
the
lungs
have
oil
inside
them
also
indicates
that
oil
is
causing
the
injuries
the
current
outbreak
is
acute
and
seems
to
be
a
reaction
to
something
toxic
found
mostly
in
illicit
products
but
the
news
could
not
come
at
a
worse
time
for
vaping
firms
they
are
under
pressure
for
marketing
e-cigarettes
to
children
enticing
them
with
fruit
flavours
the
national
youth
tobacco
survey
found
that
e-cigarette
use
among
high-school
pupils
increased
by
between
and
from
to
among
american
teenagers
e-cigarettes
are
now
the
most
commonly
used
tobacco
product
bloomberg
philanthropies
said
this
week
that
it
would
spend
m
to
discourage
their
use
by
the
young
the
non-profit
organisation
will
back
the
end
to
flavoured
e-cigarettes
the
fda
is
on
the
warpath
too
on
september
th
it
sent
a
warning
letter
to
juul
labs
an
e-cigarette
firm
in
san
francisco
about
its
marketing
the
fda
wants
companies
to
show
evidence
that
vaping
is
less
harmful
than
smoking
cigarettes
before
claiming
as
much
a
message
the
agency
says
juul
has
given
to
students
gregory
conley
president
of
the
american
vaping
association
a
non-profit
group
called
the
letter
a
colossal
waste
of
resources
aimed
at
appeasing
congressional
democrats
although
public
concern
over
marketing
and
sales
to
children
is
understandable
vaping
by
adults
trying
to
quit
or
reduce
smoking
needs
to
be
put
in
perspective
e-cigarettes
have
been
on
the
market
around
the
world
for
over
a
decade
and
are
used
annually
by
about
m
adults
in
america
legal
regulated
vapes
typically
use
a
water-soluble
solvent
as
putting
oil
in
the
lungs
is
known
to
be
dangerous
while
e-cigarettes
are
not
harmless
evidence
from
trials
suggests
that
vaping
causes
no
serious
short-term
harm
though
in
the
long
term
it
may
public-health
experts
are
also
keen
to
point
out
that
vaping
is
less
harmful
than
smoking
contrary
to
the
fda's
scepticism
peter
hajek
an
expert
on
tobacco
dependence
at
queen
mary
university
of
london
says
the
scare
is
being
used
to
deter
cigarette
smokers
from
switching
to
less
risky
vapes
overall
smokers
die
each
year
in
america
dr
hajek
said
the
current
outbreak
of
serious
lung
disease
is
more
like
the
methanol
poisoning
that
occurs
when
contaminated
alcohol
is
sold
these
are
unusual
but
can
be
deadly
despite
the
evidence
in
the
unfolding
panic
facts
are
the
first
thing
to
go
up
in
smoke
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
