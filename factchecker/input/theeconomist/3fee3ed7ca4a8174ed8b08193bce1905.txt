american
foreign
policy
is
being
tested
on
four
fronts
mike
pompeo
is
more
visible
than
rex
tillerson
was
but
american
foreign
policy
is
still
all
about
the
president
these
days
american
foreign
policy
is
a
hard
sell
in
the
countries
polled
by
the
pew
research
centre
trust
in
donald
trump
to
do
the
right
thing
languishes
below
the
ratings
for
xi
jinping
and
vladimir
putin
when
vice-president
mike
pence
paused
for
applause
for
his
boss
at
the
munich
security
conference
he
was
met
by
an
embarrassing
silence
mike
pompeo
the
secretary
of
state
and
a
faithful
preacher
of
the
trump
gospel
has
his
work
cut
out
to
persuade
people
that
america
remains
an
enormous
force
for
good
all
across
the
world
as
he
told
this
newspaper
recently
mr
trump's
policies
will
in
the
end
be
judged
by
results
and
crucial
tests
loom
on
several
fronts
one
is
in
venezuela
where
he
is
championing
efforts
to
topple
nicol
s
maduro
he
was
quick
to
recognise
juan
guaid
who
declared
himself
interim
president
in
january
but
mr
maduro
is
refusing
to
budge
and
is
blocking
efforts
to
deliver
aid
despite
what
mr
pompeo
calls
the
largest
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
history
of
man
absent
armed
conflict
the
conflict
threatens
to
escalate
in
a
high-stakes
trial
of
america's
ability
to
prevail
in
its
own
region
the
stakes
are
even
higher
with
north
korea
mr
pompeo
accompanied
mr
trump
to
hanoi
with
mr
pompeo
for
a
second
summit
with
kim
jong
un
in
advance
mr
pompeo
said
he
hoped
for
a
substantial
step
forward
towards
the
full
and
final
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
little
progress
was
made
on
that
a
giant
test
also
looms
on
china
on
february
th
mr
trump
put
off
the
steep
rise
in
tariffs
on
bn-worth
of
chinese
goods
that
was
threatened
for
march
st
citing
progress
in
trade
talks
he
even
dangled
the
prospect
of
a
summit
soon
with
mr
xi
in
florida
to
sign
a
deal
but
any
deal
that
tackles
america's
trade
deficit
with
china
without
bringing
convincing
concessions
on
the
more
fundamental
ways
china
exerts
influence
through
state
involvement
in
the
economy
will
draw
accusations
that
mr
trump
has
allowed
himself
to
be
duped
then
there
is
iran
a
focus
of
mr
pompeo's
most
recent
trip
to
europe
in
mid-february
which
included
a
gathering
of
more
than
countries
in
warsaw
that
meeting
was
a
shambles
but
mr
pompeo
is
unfazed
he
has
devoted
a
lot
of
energy
to
iran
and
is
at
his
most
animated
when
speaking
about
it
he
rattles
off
a
long
list
of
things
iran
must
do
for
starters
including
stopping
arming
militias
in
yemen
ceasing
its
underwriting
of
hezbollah
and
defunding
qassem
soleimani
who
as
commander
of
iran's
quds
force
is
conducting
terror
attacks
all
around
the
world
whether
or
not
american-led
economic
sanctions
work
they
are
straining
relations
with
america's
european
allies
who
have
stuck
with
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
despite
mr
trump
dumping
it
mr
pompeo
says
he
sees
no
divide
over
iran
no
one
argues
with
the
central
thesis
that
iran
poses
the
greatest
risk
to
stability
in
the
middle
east
he
says
and
serious
conversations
are
under
way
with
european
countries
about
how
to
limit
iran's
missile
capability
but
he
also
warns
that
america
will
enforce
its
sanctions
regime
vigorously
whatever
machinations
anyone
tries
to
go
through
to
get
round
it
big
european
companies
have
already
pulled
out
of
iran
those
companies
are
gone
stresses
mr
pompeo
and
they
ain't
going
back
it
also
falls
to
mr
pompeo
to
try
to
preside
over
a
show
of
allied
unity
when
he
hosts
nato
foreign
ministers
in
washington
dc
on
april
th
the
alliance's
th
anniversary
mr
trump
has
shaken
nato
with
his
heavy-handed
demands
that
the
allies
must
spend
far
more
on
their
own
defence
even
threatening
that
america
might
go
it
alone
if
they
do
not
mr
pompeo
mixes
insistence
that
more
needs
to
be
done
with
recognition
of
the
remarkable
increase
in
spending
under
way
our
adversaries
see
that
our
nato
team
is
getting
on
the
field
mr
pompeo
himself
is
playing
on
he
has
ruled
out
a
senate
run
in
kansas
since
his
transfer
from
the
cia
last
april
he
has
tried
to
restore
swagger
to
the
state
department
not
boastfulness
he
stresses
but
pride
even
with
better
management
however
the
policies
remain
mr
trump's
and
they
are
entering
testing
times
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
