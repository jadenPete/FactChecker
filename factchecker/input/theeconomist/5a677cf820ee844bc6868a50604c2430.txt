how
a
small
city
is
responding
to
a
huge
influx
of
somali-americans
dark-skinned
muslims
discover
the
limits
of
minnesota
nice
young
men
take
sips
of
sweetened
tea
from
plastic
cups
their
hangout
is
the
somali
grocery
and
restaurant
a
scruffy
brightly
lit
spot
a
few
steps
from
the
mississippi
river
in
central
minnesota
the
men
while
eyeing
a
televised
football
game
discuss
the
difficulty
of
finding
well-paid
jobs
a
biochemistry
graduate
abdiweli
barre
says
career-building
is
tricky
in
st
cloud
a
city
of
barely
it
might
be
easier
an
hour
away
in
minneapolis
a
global
hub
for
the
east-african
diaspora
ilhan
omar
a
woman
from
minneapolis
just
became
the
first
somali-american
elected
to
congress
but
these
tea-drinkers
and
a
growing
number
of
somalis
prefer
smaller-town
living
they
say
st
cloud
is
safe
and
on
balance
congenial
that
is
despite
its
notoriety
after
a
incident
when
a
somali
refugee
stabbed
and
injured
ten
people
in
a
mall
he
was
shot
dead
the
caf
was
once
pelted
with
eggs
insults
and
bottles
have
been
thrown
at
women
wearing
hijabs
in
the
street
the
tea-drinkers
complain
of
racism
among
police
and
employers
and
they
laugh
at
others
misconceptions
people
who
believe
we
don't
pay
tax
that
we
drive
free
cars
and
live
in
free
houses
chuckles
mr
barre
the
graduate
but
he
suggests
that
among
locals
are
good
people
and
he
knows
discrimination
exists
elsewhere
in
late
november
a
gunman
in
eden
prairie
a
similar-sized
city
also
in
minnesota
was
arrested
for
threatening
a
group
of
somali
teens
whom
he
accused
of
buying
burgers
with
welfare
money
big
cities
draw
many
migrants
and
refugees
but
it
is
in
smaller
places
like
st
cloud
historically
of
german
and
nordic
stock
that
especially
dramatic
demographic
change
occurs
an
immigration
lawyer
estimates
the
metro
area
with
inhabitants
is
home
to
people
of
somali
descent
from
almost
none
two
decades
ago
a
pioneer
was
abdul
kadir
mohamed
who
is
wrapped
tight
in
a
grey
duffle
coat
hat
and
scarf
as
he
steps
into
the
caf
he
says
he
arrived
as
a
refugee
in
there
were
six
somalis
when
i
came
and
no
discrimination
no
hostility
he
calls
that
the
beginning
of
the
somalian
time
today
we
have
so
many
people
he
says
a
note
of
wonder
in
his
voice
some
settled
as
refugees
directly
from
east
africa
but
many
moved
from
within
america
drawn
to
jobs
in
meatpacking
sites
or
with
manufacturers
such
as
electrolux
america's
legal
immigration
rules
which
look
favourably
on
family
members
of
migrants
swelled
the
population
further
a
few
somalis
now
spill
out
to
tiny
agricultural
towns
such
as
nearby
coldspring
population
in
truly
rural
areas
concern
about
this
pattern
runs
through
a
recent
book
by
reihan
salam
an
author
of
bangladeshi-descent
he
argues
that
historically
high
rates
of
low-skilled
immigration
have
resulted
in
the
creation
of
ethnic
enclaves
and
helped
to
worsen
economic
inequality
by
keeping
down
wages
together
that
threatens
to
make
an
ever
more
dangerously
divided
society
split
between
groups
of
irreconcilable
strangers
he
argues
the
remedy
is
to
choke
off
low-skilled
immigration
only
if
fewer
outsiders
arrive
will
those
already
here
integrate
the
alternative
he
suggests
is
a
permanent
non-white
underclass
on
average
somalis
in
st
cloud
are
indeed
poorer
and
worse-educated
than
other
minnesotans
they
are
also
self-starters
the
city
is
home
to
dozens
of
small
firms
including
money-transfer
businesses
and
clothes
shops
at
a
somali
strip
mall
custom
is
brisk
at
the
mogadishu
meat
and
grocery
beside
a
low-rise
brick
mosque
crowded
with
women
in
bright
headscarves
that
suggests
dynamism
but
also
a
community
apart
from
the
mainstream
haji
yussuf
who
owns
a
communications
firm
says
mingling
happens
slowly
partly
because
of
somalis
strong
cultural
pride
just
like
for
jews
and
italians
yet
a
backlash
is
also
evident
to
see
it
visit
culver's
a
caf
five
minutes
from
the
first
it
is
a
neon-lit
fast-food
chain
with
jolly
staff
all
the
patrons
on
a
recent
day
are
white
in
a
corner
booth
his
black
tea
in
a
china
mug
is
john
palmer
a
retired
academic
from
st
cloud
university
he
calls
culvers
his
campaign
office
brandishes
a
red
make
st
cloud
great
again
cap
and
says
the
city
is
in
near-terminal
decline
mr
palmer
is
a
fan
of
the
president's
for
slashing
refugee
resettlement
he
says
that
somalis
will
not
assimilate
unlike
an
earlier
smaller
group
of
christian
hmong
refugees
and
complains
that
somali
women
dress
in
a
way
that
certainly
causes
fear
he
also
calls
low-income
newcomers
a
burden
even
if
many
have
jobs
a
rise
in
non-english
speakers
strains
public
schools
he
says
sending
better-off
taxpayers
away
that
qualifies
me
as
an
islamophobe
and
a
hater
apparently
he
adds
he
organises
as
part
of
a
group
called
c-cubed
for
concerned
community
citizens
he
blames
new
ghettos
for
violent
crime
violent
crime
is
falling
in
running
for
election
to
the
city
council
he
lost
narrowly
he
says
he
dared
not
canvas
near
somali-dominated
housing
he
promoted
a
ballot
initiative
it
failed
that
demanded
the
council
somehow
ban
settlement
of
any
more
refugees
others
are
more
extreme
some
churches
have
hosted
firebrand
anti-muslim
anti-refugee
speakers
natalie
ringsmuth
of
unite
cloud
a
charity
says
they
appeal
to
lower-income
anxious
white
residents
one
man
erected
a
sign
of
a
pig
on
his
lawn
then
screamed
at
a
neighbouring
muslim
family
ms
ringsmuth
calls
the
city
ground
zero
for
online
alt-right
extremists
but
like
the
tea-drinkers
in
the
somali
caf
she
is
phlegmatic
she
expects
strangers
to
reconcile
given
time
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the

re-elected

go
what

expect
from
