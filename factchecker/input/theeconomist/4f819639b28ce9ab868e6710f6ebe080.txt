american
life
is
improving
for
the
lowest
paid
come
back
capitalism
all
is
forgiven
brad
hooper
quit
his
previous
job
at
a
grocery
in
madison
because
his
boss
was
a
little
crazy
the
manager
threatened
to
sack
him
and
other
cashiers
for
refusing
orders
to
work
longer
than
their
agreed
hours
not
long
ago
mr
hooper's
decision
to
walk
out
might
have
looked
foolhardy
a
long-haired
navy
veteran
he
suffers
from
recurrent
ill-health
including
insomnia
he
has
no
education
beyond
high
school
early
this
decade
he
was
jobless
for
a
year
and
recalls
how
back
then
there
were
a
thousand
people
applying
for
every
mcdonald's
job
this
time
he
struck
lucky
finding
much
better
work
today
he
sells
tobacco
and
cigarettes
in
a
chain
store
for
hours
a
week
that
leaves
plenty
of
time
for
his
passion
reading
science
fiction
and
after
years
of
low
earnings
he
collects
an
hour
almost
double
the
state's
minimum
rate
and
better
than
the
grocer's
pay
his
new
employer
has
already
bumped
up
his
wages
twice
in
months
it's
pretty
good
he
says
with
a
grin
what's
really
rare
he
adds
is
his
annual
week
of
paid
holiday
the
firm
also
offers
help
with
health
insurance
his
improving
fortunes
reflect
recent
gains
for
many
of
america's
lowest-paid
handwritten
help
wanted
signs
adorn
windows
of
many
caf
s
and
shops
in
madison
a
few
steps
on
from
the
cigarette
shop
is
the
city's
job
centre
where
a
manager
with
little
else
to
do
points
to
a
screen
that
tallies
unfilled
vacancies
across
wisconsin
in
five
years
he
says
he
has
never
seen
such
demand
for
labour
he
says
some
employers
now

from
a

unemployment
in
wisconsin
is
below
which
is
a
record
across
america
it
was
last
this
low
at
half
a
century
ago
a
tight
labour
market
has
been
pushing
up
median
pay
for
some
time
fewer
unauthorised
immigrants
arriving
in
america
may
contribute
to
the
squeeze
though
this
is
disputed
official
figures
show
average
hourly
earnings
rising
by
on
an
annual
basis
right
now
part
time
it
seems
like
everyone
is
hiring
every
american
who
wants
a
job
right
now
can
get
a
job
says
another
shop
worker
in
merrillville
in
northern
indiana
in
any
economic
upturn
the
last
group
of
workers
to
prosper
are
typically
the
poorest
earners
such
as
low-skilled
shopstaff
food
preparers
care-givers
and
temps
their
pay
was
walloped
in
the
great
recession
a
decade
ago
and
the
recovery
since
has
been
unusually
slow
pay
has
leapt
recently
with
the
lowest-paid
enjoying
faster
gains
than
the
better-off
the
benefits
are
not
equally
spread
in
wisconsin
as
in
much
of
the
country
more
jobs
are
being
created
in
urban
areas
and
in
services
laura
dresser
a
labour
economist
points
to
a
very
big
racial
inequality
among
workers
wages
have
been
rising
fastest
for
african-americans
but
poorer
blacks
especially
those
with
felony
convictions
are
also
likelier
to
have
fallen
out
of
the
formal
labour
market
so
are
not
counted
in
unemployment
figures
the
wage
recovery
is
not
only
about
markets
policy
matters
too
some
states
typically
republican-run
have
been
reluctant
to
lift
minimum
wages
above
the
federal
level
of
an
hour
in
merrillville
a
worker
in
a
petshop
carries
a
husky
puppy
to
be
inspected
by
a
group
of
teenage
girls
staff
are
paid
a
dollar
or
two
above
the
minimum
wage
says
his
manager
despite
his
years
employment
and
over
hours
toil
each
week
his
pay
and
benefits
amount
to
little
he
calls
occasional
bonuses
a
carrot
at
the
end
of
the
road
he
could
munch
on
bigger
carrots
in
other
states
lawmakers
in
some
states
are
more
willing
to
lift
minimum
wages
where
they
do
the
incomes
of
the
lowest-paid
rise
particularly
fast
thirteen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
raised
the
minimum
wage
last
year
some
cities
like
chicago
and
new
york
occasionally
raise
it
too
elise
gould
of
the
economic
policy
institute
told
congress
in
march
that
in
states
which
put
up
minimum
wages
at
least
once
in
the
five
years
to
incomes
for
the
poorest
rose
by
an
average
of
in
the
remaining
states
by
contrast
the
poorest
got
a
rise
of
over
the
same
period
in
neither
case
however
do
the
increases
amount
to
much
better
long-term
prospects
for
the
worst-off
by
last
year
the
poorest
were
still
earning
only
a
miserly
more
per
hour
than
they
did
in
real
wages
years
ago
median
hourly
pay
for
america's
workers
was
up
a
little
more
by
one
study
in
wisconsin
suggests
that
caretakers
for
example
took
home
over
an
hour
by
last
year
so
were
only
just
getting
back
to
their
real
average
earnings
achieved
in
expansion
at
the
bottom
of
the
labour
market
is
finally
pulling
some
wages
up
but
it's
certainly
been
much
slower
in
this
boom
than
any
other
argues
tim
smeeding
a
poverty
expert
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
in
madison
he
describes
capital
winning
over
labour
for
several
decades
and
expects
the
trend
to
continue
given
weak
unions
more
automation
and
other
trends
the
poorest
get
some
hard-to-measure
benefits
in
addition
to
higher
hourly
pay
mr
hooper
is
not
alone
in
daring
to
walk
away
from
an
exploitative
boss
more
of
the
low-paid
get
a
bit
more
say
on
how
and
when
they
toil
many
crave
a
reduction
in
the
income
volatility
that
afflicts
them
since
sudden
swings
in
earnings
are
associated
with
poor
mental
health
high
stress
and
worry
over
losing
access
to
financial
assistance
or
food
stamps
one
study
of
households
by
pew
found
in
that
of
them
would
opt
for
lower
average
incomes
if
earnings
were
predictable
follow-up
research
late
last
year
suggested
the
same
trends
are
still
present
low-
and
middle-income
households
remain
anxious
about
volatile
earnings
most
have
almost
no
savings
many
would
struggle
with
a
financial
shock
of
just
a
few
hundred
dollars
lots
of
jobs
that
are
being
created
are
in
or
near
flourishing
cities
like
madison
where
low-paid
workers
are
squeezed
by
high
housing
costs
pew
has
estimated
that
of
all
tenant
households
spend
at
least
of
their
income
on
rent
living
in
more
affordable
places
such
as
janesville
an
hour
south
of
madison
may
be
an
option
for
the
lower-paid
but
that
means
commuting
to
the
city
or
taking
local
jobs
with
less
pay
and
fewer
benefits
few
workers
earning
less
than
an
hour
get
health
insurance
from
their
employer
whereas
most
do
so
above
that
threshold
katherine
cramer
who
studies
the
long-standing
causes
of
simmering
anger
among
poorer
rural
americans
says
resentment
is
worse
than
before
despite
the
recent
better
wages
rural
folk
complain
that
it's
been
like
this
for
decades
she
says
a
year
or
two
catching
up
has
not
yet
been
enough
to
change
their
minds
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
