mark
sanford
is
back
on
the
trail
the
former
luv
guv
looks
like
donald
trump's
most
serious
challenger
nowhere
in
america
is
more
synonymous
with
rebellion
than
charleston
harbour
where
mark
sanford
launched
his
tilt
at
president
donald
trump
this
week
glinting
in
the
sun
behind
the
veteran
republican
a
two-term
governor
of
south
carolina
and
five-term
congressman
was
fort
sumter
target
of
the
confederacy's
first
shots
farther
off
a
blur
on
the
horizon
was
fort
johnson
where
south
carolina's
state
flag
was
first
raised
in
defiance
during
the
revolutionary
war
but
mr
sanford
who
lives
round
the
corner
was
keen
not
to
imply
any
symbolism
which
was
understandable
his
primary
campaign
which
he
mounted
with
the
aid
of
a
life-size
cut-out
of
mr
trump
he
found
on
amazon
a
fake
cardboard
cheque
for
a
trillion
dollars
payable
to
burden
of
future
generations
and
a
couple
of
volunteers
to
hold
them
may
be
the
most
doomed
action
the
venerable
port
has
ever
witnessed
the
three
state-wide
rallies
mr
sanford
held
that
day
were
attended
by
a
few
journalists
and
fewer
bystanders
south
carolinians
have
little
reason
to
notice
his
campaign
the
state's
republicans
along
with
those
in
arizona
kansas
and
nevada
have
already
said
they
will
not
hold
a
presidential
primary
the
republican
national
committee
which
has
dissolved
its
primary
debate
committee
is
pressing
others
to
follow
suit
in
some
countries
with
all
respect
to
your
mother
country
they
have
coronations
said
mr
sanford
in
his
stump
speech
nodding
sensitively
to
lexington
who
had
joined
him
earlier
on
a
two-hour
drive
from
columbia
but
in
the
american
system
we
have
debate
and
elections
we
need
a
debate
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
republican
mr
trump's
tightening
grip
on
his
party
has
probably
spared
him
the
heavyweight
challenger
his
conservative
critics
have
been
longing
for
john
kasich
has
no
interest
in
a
losing
fight
nikki
haley
is
keeping
her
powder
dry
mitt
romney's
rebelliousness
is
confined
to
an
occasional
admonishing
tweet
as
things
stand
this
has
left
the
field
to
three
lesser
challengers
bill
weld
the
moderate
former
governor
of
massachusetts
joe
walsh
a
populist
former
congressman
from
illinois
and
mr
sanford
whose
record
warrants
most
respect
a
solid
small-government
conservative
for
whom
a
big
future
was
once
predicted
he
is
now
best-known
for
the
calamitous
denouement
to
his
governorship
and
marriage
a
decade
ago
he
was
found
to
have
snuck
off
to
visit
his
mistress
in
argentina
after
informing
aides
that
he
was
hiking
the
appalachian
trail
yet
an
improbable
return
to
politics
four
years
later
when
he
won
his
old
congressional
seat
in
charleston
helped
mend
his
reputation
and
so
in
some
quarters
did
his
subsequent
refusal
to
join
his
republican
colleagues
in
bending
the
knee
to
a
president
most
had
previously
denounced
and
still
abhorred
after
criticising
mr
trump's
divisiveness
protectionism
and
profligacy
mr
sanford
was
unseated
by
a
trump-endorsed
primary
opponent
last
year
it
was
his
first
electoral
defeat
he
says
his
refusal
to
genuflect
was
indirectly
a
result
of
his
humiliation
i
owed
it
to
the
people
who
gave
me
a
second
chance
to
shoot
straight
down
the
middle
his
disgrace
might
even
be
a
political
advantage
he
thinks
there's
almost
an
added
element
of
relatability
that
comes
with
public
failure
his
wrongdoing
certainly
made
him
more
famous
compared
with
some
of
the
things
mr
trump
stands
accused
of
it
also
looks
less
serious
now
of
the
three
conservative
groups
he
and
his
fellow
challengers
represent
moderates
working-class
populists
and
small-government
conservatives
mr
sanford's
is
probably
the
smallest
yet
it
may
be
the
most
mutinous
most
moderates
having
already
gone
democratic
while
he
almost
certainly
cannot
beat
mr
trump
it
is
therefore
not
all
that
hard
to
imagine
him
embarrassing
the
president
sufficiently
to
hurt
his
re-election
prospects
of
the
past
four
incumbent
presidents
to
face
a
primary
challenge
only
one
nixon
in
won
re-election
the
debate
mr
sanford
called
is
worth
having
too
while
he
glumly
acknowledges
how
most
republicans
have
cheered
as
mr
trump
abandoned
free
trade
and
fiscal
restraint
the
former
governor
clings
to
a
hope
that
this
shift
will
be
temporary
for
years
i've
been
out
there
talking
to
people
and
the
central
premise
of
this
campaign
is
that
all
those
conversations
about
the
debt
and
spending
issue
were
real
mr
trump's
remaking
of
his
party
has
been
exaggerated
he
suggests
by
the
president's
eccentric
personality
and
lucky
timing
republican
voters
picked
him
as
a
disrupter
and
are
now
rewarding
him
for
the
historic
growth
cycle
he
is
presiding
over
but
i
would
argue
the
value
proposition
with
trump
evaporates
the
minute
the
economy
goes
down
in
truth
there
was
never
much
evidence
that
republicans
cared
about
the
deficit
except
in
opposition
which
doesn't
count
yet
mr
sanford
is
probably
right
that
mr
trump
has
not
changed
their
thinking
for
good
on
other
issues
history
suggests
relatively
few
voters
care
about
trade
the
president's
obsession
for
example
and
as
mr
trump's
hold
on
power
is
less
firm
than
his
hold
on
his
party
this
points
to
a
great
uncertainty
about
what
republicans
will
stand
for
post-trump
in
some
ways
the
party
may
snap
back
in
others
probably
including
the
president's
antipathy
to
immigration
which
mr
sanford
also
deplores
it
will
not
and
no
doubt
that
rejig
will
again
be
shaped
by
electoral
happenstance
and
the
character
of
the
leaders
that
emerge
which
makes
it
worth
underlining
how
unlikely
mr
sanford's
new
role
as
saviour
of
the
republic
would
until
recently
have
seemed
the
recklessness
he
displayed
in
his
argentine
flit
was
not
a
one-off
he
was
accused
of
squandering
state
resources
for
example
by
commandeering
a
government
plane
to
go
for
a
haircut
his
divorce
papers
noted
his
habit
of
dive-bombing
his
children
in
a
family
plane
though
agreeable
to
lexington
he
also
has
a
mixed
reputation
as
a
boss
that
such
a
man
could
now
seem
so
heroic
does
not
say
much
for
the
state
of
the
republican
party
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
