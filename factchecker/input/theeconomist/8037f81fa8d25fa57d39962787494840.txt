rudy
giuliani's
ukrainian
adventure
president
trump's
personal
lawyer
appears
to
have
crossed
a
line
editor's
note
september
th
american
newspapers
have
reported
that
a
whistleblower
in
america's
intelligence
services
has
complained
about
an
unspecified
commitment
made
by
president
donald
trump
in
a
telephone
call
with
a
foreign
leader
among
other
actions
at
least
part
of
the
complaint
they
say
concerns
ukraine
this
article
from
this
week's
print
edition
explains
the
background
to
the
deepening
controversy
connecting
america's
domestic
politics
and
ukraine
of
all
the
meetings
that
will
take
place
between
heads
of
state
at
the
united
nations
in
new
york
next
week
the
one
between
presidents
donald
trump
and
volodymyr
zelensky
pictured
a
comedian
turned
president
of
ukraine
may
be
the
strangest
last
month
as
ukraine's
government
was
trying
to
negotiate
the
release
of
its
prisoners
from
russia
it
received
news
from
washington
the
white
house
had
frozen
m
of
military
assistance
to
ukraine
that
had
already
been
approved
by
congress
until
further
review
the
administration
set
no
criteria
or
time
frame
for
the
review
but
a
month
earlier
in
a
telephone
conversation
with
mr
zelensky
then
newly
elected
mr
trump
said
he
was
convinced
the
new
ukrainian
government
would
be
able
to
quickly
improve
the
image
of
ukraine
and
complete
the
investigations
of
corruption
cases
which
inhibited
the
interaction
between
ukraine
and
the
usa
there
were
two
cases
mr
trump
seemed
particularly
interested
in
the
first
involved
the
affairs
of
hunter
biden
son
of
the
candidate
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
who
sat
on
the
board
of
a
private
ukrainian
gas
firm
while
his
father
was
america's
vice-president
the
second
involved
the
downfall
of
paul
manafort
mr
trump's
former
campaign
chairman
who
took
a
m
off-the-books
payment
for
his
work
for
an
ex-president
of
ukraine
viktor
yanukovich
and
is
now
in
prison
it
was
up
to
the
new
president
to
satisfy
mr
trump
that
he
was
on
the
right
side
if
mr
zelensky
was
still
in
any
doubt
about
what
was
expected
of
him
rudy
giuliani
mr
trump's
personal
lawyer
was
there
to
help
a
few
days
after
the
telephone
conversation
between
the
two
presidents
mr
giuliani
flew
to
madrid
to
meet
mr
zelensky's
adviser
andriy
yermak
he
urged
mr
yermak
to
investigate
the
matters
that
were
of
interest
to
mr
trump
and
held
out
the
prospect
of
a
state
visit
to
america
and
a
meeting
with
the
president
that
meeting
in
madrid
was
arranged
by
kurt
volker
america's
special
envoy
whose
efforts
to
help
ukraine
restore
its
territorial
integrity
and
sovereignty
over
the
donbas
region
were
undermined
by
the
suspension
of
military
aid
although
the
state
department
insisted
mr
giuliani
was
merely
acting
in
his
private
capacity
rather
than
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
the
eyes
of
any
reasonable
person
particularly
the
one
from
ukraine
where
oligarchs
wield
much
informal
power
mr
giuliani
was
more
important
than
a
state
official
he
was
mr
trump's
consigliere
fittingly
mr
giuliani's
main
source
of
disinformation
on
ukraine
was
yuriy
lutsenko
a
controversial
former
prosecutor-general
mr
lutsenko
first
tried
to
sabotage
anti-corruption
efforts
by
ukrainian
activists
and
american-backed
investigators
then
accused
his
critics
of
conspiring
against
mr
trump
trying
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
white
house
and
settle
his
own
scores
mr
lutsenko
declared
that
the
stuff
about
mr
manafort
was
all
part
of
an
anti-trump
conspiracy
mr
lutsenko
also
dragged
marie
yovanovitch
an
experienced
american
career
diplomat
and
ambassador
to
ukraine
through
the
mud
alleging
she
was
acting
in
the
interests
of
the
democrats
ms
yovanovitch
who
supported
the
anti-corruption
fight
in
ukraine
a
fight
which
also
targeted
mr
lutsenko
was
recalled
before
the
end
of
her
term
despite
the
state
department's
statement
that
the
claims
against
her
were
an
outright
fabrication
mr
giuliani
liked
mr
lutsenko's
improbable
version
of
events
though
in
may
he
told
fox
news
that
he
had
cancelled
his
planned
trip
to
kiev
because
he
thought
he
was
about
to
walk
into
a
group
of
people
that
are
enemies
of
the
president
and
in
some
cases
enemies
of
the
united
states
one
of
the
enemies
named
was
serhiy
leshchenko
a
journalist
anti-corruption
campaigner
and
member
of
parliament
who
investigated
mr
manafort
mr
leshchenko
had
been
working
for
mr
zelensky's
team
advising
the
neophyte
president
on
foreign
affairs
but
mr
giuliani's
statement
made
the
new
president
uneasy
a
few
days
later
mr
leshchenko
was
told
that
he
could
not
be
offered
a
formal
position
in
mr
zelensky's
new
administration
since
this
would
jeopardise
ukraine's
relations
with
a
strategic
partner
as
a
result
of
all
this
mr
giuliani
and
his
boss
have
become
the
subject
of
an
investigation
by
the
house
committees
on
foreign
affairs
intelligence
and
oversight
he
denies
wrongdoing
i
wouldn't
do
an
unethical
thing
in
my
life
he
told
cnn
on
september
th
the
democratic
chairmen
of
the
three
committees
sent
a
formal
request
to
the
white
house
and
the
state
department
instructing
them
to
turn
over
the
documents
related
to
what
look
like
attempts
to
coerce
the
ukrainian
government
into
conducting
politically
motivated
investigations
if
mr
trump
really
had
pressured
ukraine
to
serve
the
ends
of
his
re-election
campaign
this
would
represent
a
staggering
abuse
of
power
a
boon
to
moscow
and
a
betrayal
of
the
public
trust
the
letter
says
less
than
a
week
after
the
launch
of
the
investigation
the
white
house
unfroze
the
funds
for
military
assistance
without
explaining
the
hold-up
there
were
a
lot
of
senior
republicans
who
were
asking
wtf
one
former
official
says
but
the
damage
has
been
done
mr
giuliani's
adventures
in
ukrainian
politics
undermined
the
american
government's
efforts
to
bolster
its
ally
militarily
and
subverted
its
anti-corruption
message
vladimir
putin
has
long
maintained
that
he
is
no
worse
than
his
american
partners
they
just
hide
things
better
mr
giuliani
and
mr
trump
are
in
danger
of
proving
him
right
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
