what
to
make
of
the
mueller
report
the
redacted
version
suggests
that
donald
trump
is
his
own
worst
enemy
the
most
eagerly
anticipated
work
of
american
literature
has
finally
been
published
albeit
with
a
few
parts
missing
which
only
make
it
seem
more
tantalising
robert
mueller's
report
has
been
downloaded
almost
times
from
government
websites
many
more
people
will
have
looked
at
copies
emailed
by
friends
or
hosted
on
media
websites
the
interest
in
a
government
report
more
than
pages
long
is
understandable
mr
mueller
spent
nearly
two
years
investigating
links
between
the
russian
government
and
president
donald
trump's
campaign
last
month
the
attorney-general
william
barr
released
a
four-page
summary
stating
that
the
report
did
not
establish
that
anyone
involved
with
mr
trump's
campaign
conspired
or
co-ordinated
with
russia
in
its
election-interference
efforts
nor
did
it
establish
that
mr
trump
committed
obstruction
of
justice
mr
trump
treated
that
summary
as
dispositive
no
collusion
no
obstruction
complete
and
total
exoneration
as
he
tweeted
the
full
report
paints
a
different
picture
the
first
pages
concern
russia
they
begin
by
laying
out
the
scope
of
russia's
influence
operation
some
of
this
may
be
familiar
to
those
who
perused
two
previous
indictments
issued
by
mr
mueller's
team
one
was
against
members
of
the
gru
russia's
military-intelligence
agency
who
hacked
into
and
stole
emails
from
servers
belonging
to
the
democratic
party
and
to
people
working
for
hillary
clinton's
campaign
the
other
was
against
the
internet
research
agency
ira
a
russian
troll
farm
run
by
a
russian
businessman
closely
linked
to
vladimir
putin
which
engaged
in
a
social-media
campaign
to
sow
discord
and
damage
mrs
clinton's
campaign
though
americans
have
understandably
been
focused
on
the
evidence
about
whether
the
president
was
complicit
in
a
foreign
power's
attempt
to
sway
the
election
this
part
of
the
report
is
arguably
the
most
important
part
from
the
point
of
view
of
protecting
future
elections
unfortunately
america's
deep
political
divisions
are
all
too
easy
to
exploit
ira
staff
sitting
in
st
petersburg
the
one
on
the
neva
rather
than
on
tampa
bay
pretended
to
be
americans
on
social
media
and
staked
out
divisive
positions
on
either
end
of
the
political
spectrum
passing
themselves
off
as
supporters
of
mr
trump
or
of
black
lives
matter
the
outfit
also
organised
multiple
real-world
events
starting
with
a
confederate
rally
in
houston
in
late
as
well
as
several
pro-trump
rallies
in
florida
new
york
and
pennsylvania
a
state
that
mr
trump
won
narrowly
and
unexpectedly
some
rallies
the
report
explains
drew
few
attendees
others
drew
hundreds
candidate
trump
pointed
to
one
event
organised
by
the
ira
in
florida
as
evidence
of
his
popularity
there
the
russian
government
and
the
trump
campaign
were
working
to
the
same
purpose
and
each
hoped
the
other
would
help
it
out
but
as
mr
barr
noted
in
both
his
written
summary
and
his
press
conference
mr
mueller's
team
did
not
establish
that
anyone
from
mr
trump's
campaign
conspired
or
coordinated
with
russia
in
those
efforts
here
is
how
mr
mueller's
team
put
it
although
the
investigation
established
that
the
russian
government
perceived
it
would
benefit
from
a
trump
presidency
and
worked
to
secure
that
outcome
and
that
the
campaign
expected
it
would
benefit
electorally
from
information
stolen
through
russian
efforts
the
investigation
did
not
establish
that
members
of
the
trump
campaign
conspired
or
coordinated
with
the
russian
government
in
its
election
interference
activities
this
judgment
turns
on
the
absence
of
any
agreement
explicit
or
implicit
between
the
parties
to
conspire
which
seems
fair
nevertheless
the
enthusiasm
of
trump
campaign
members
for
working
with
people
with
ties
to
a
government
that
kills
journalists
imprisons
political
rivals
and
had
recently
pulled
off
the
first
land
grab
in
europe
since
the
second
world
war
is
quite
something
to
see
when
it
is
all
put
in
the
same
place
paul
manafort
mr
trump's
campaign
chair
who
was
deep
in
debt
to
a
russian
oligarch
shared
internal
polling
data
with
konstantin
kilimnik
one
of
his
kiev-based
employees
with
apparent
links
to
both
that
oligarch
and
russian
intelligence
even
rick
gates
mr
manafort's
right-hand
man
believed
mr
kilimnik
was
a
spy
that
did
not
stop
mr
manafort
from
meeting
mr
kilimnik
george
papadopoulos
a
junior
foreign-policy
advisor
who
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
federal
investigators
tried
to
let
the
campaign
know
early
on
that
the
russians
had
compromising
material
on
mrs
clinton
nobody
thought
to
tell
the
fbi
donald
trump
junior
arranged
a
meeting
with
a
russian
lawyer
who
promised
dirt
on
mrs
clinton
and
of
course
mr
trump
himself
was
pursuing
a
trump
tower
moscow
project
until
just
five
months
before
the
election
while
simultaneously
pushing
for
better
relations
with
moscow
none
of
this
may
have
been
illegal
but
had
voters
known
about
it
they
might
have
made
a
different
choice
the
report's
second
part
deals
with
obstruction
of
justice
both
in
his
summary
and
again
in
his
press
conference
mr
barr
noted
that
mr
mueller
declined
to
make
a
traditional
prosecutorial
judgment
regarding
whether
to
bring
charges
guiding
that
reluctance
was
long-standing
policy
against
indicting
a
sitting
president
which
wrote
mr
mueller
led
him
not
to
apply
an
approach
that
could
potentially
result
in
a
judgment
that
the
president
committed
crimes
because
no
charges
could
be
brought
mr
trump
would
have
no
chance
to
clear
his
name
at
trial
but
mr
mueller
continues
if
we
had
confidence
after
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
facts
that
the
president
clearly
did
not
commit
obstruction
of
justice
we
would
so
state
accordingly
while
this
report
does
not
conclude
that
the
president
committed
a
crime
neither
does
it
exonerate
him
sustaining
an
obstruction
charge
requires
three
things
an
obstructive
act
a
connection
between
that
act
and
an
actual
or
contemplated
criminal
proceeding
and
corrupt
intent
mr
mueller
comes
closest
to
accusing
mr
trump
of
meeting
those
three
conditions
in
the
firing
of
james
comey
a
former
fbi
director
six
days
after
mr
comey
declined
to
publicly
state
that
mr
trump
was
not
personally
under
investigation
afterwards
he
told
the
russian
foreign
minister
i
faced
great
pressure
because
of
russia
that's
taken
off
that
could
be
an
obstructive
act
because
although
it
did
not
stop
the
investigation
into
his
campaign's
links
with
russia
it
could
affect
how
mr
comey's
successor
conducted
that
investigation
but
mr
mueller
leaves
open
whether
mr
trump's
motive
was
a
desire
to
impede
the
investigation
or
simple
anger
that
a
subordinate
failed
to
do
as
told
nor
is
that
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
president
tried
to
influence
the
investigation
he
tried
to
get
the
white
house
counsel
to
remove
mr
mueller
and
then
to
deny
that
he
had
made
that
request
he
tried
to
get
jeff
sessions
the
former
attorney-general
to
curtail
the
terms
of
mr
mueller's
investigation
and
to
rescind
his
recusal
from
overseeing
it
he
tried
to
prevent
the
disclosure
of
embarrassing
emails
he
seemed
to
dangle
a
pardon
before
mr
manafort
after
michael
cohen
his
former
lawyer
began
cooperating
with
mr
mueller
mr
trump
called
him
a
rat
and
publicly
insulted
his
family
as
mr
mueller
notes
the
president's
efforts
to
influence
the
investigation
were
mostly
unsuccessful
but
that
is
largely
because
the
persons
who
surrounded
the
president
declined
to
carry
out
orders
or
accede
to
his
requests
the
striking
thing
about
this
section
when
read
in
full
is
how
self-wounding
mr
trump's
behaviour
has
been
had
he
simply
kept
quiet
and
let
mr
mueller
complete
his
investigation
into
his
campaign's
links
into
russia
the
obstruction
investigation
never
would
have
happened
instead
he
interfered
clumsily
on
many
occasions
allowing
the
special
counsel
to
amass
a
damning
record
of
the
president's
truculence
dishonesty
and
contempt
for
federal
investigators
mr
barr
said
in
his
press
conference
that
mr
trump
was
frustrated
and
angered
by
a
sincere
belief
that
the
investigation
was
undermining
his
presidency
but
all
presidents
are
harassed
and
attacked
by
the
opposition
party
none
in
recent
memory
have
responded
as
mr
trump
has
mr
barr
also
said
that
the
white
house
has
fully
co-operated
with
mr
mueller's
investigation
but
mr
trump
never
agreed
to
be
interviewed
by
mr
mueller's
team
instead
he
provided
written
answers
to
questions
which
said
mr
mueller
were
insufficien
t
the
president
stated
on
more
than
occasions
that
he
does
not
recall
or
remember
or
have
an
independent
recollection
of
information
called
for
by
the
questions
other
answers
were
incomplete
or
imprecise
mr
barr
also
stated
that
mr
mueller
did
not
indicate
that
his
purpose
was
to
leave
the
decision
whether
mr
trump
obstructed
justice
to
congress
it
was
my
prerogative
as
attorney
general
to
make
that
decision
mr
mueller's
report
is
not
so
clear
congress
has
authority
he
wrote
to
prohibit
a
president's
corrupt
use
of
his
authority
the
conclusion
that
congress
may
apply
the
obstruction
laws
to
the
president's
corrupt
exercise
of
the
powers
of
office
accords
with
our
constitutional
system
of
checks
and
balances
and
the
principle
that
no
person
is
above
the
law
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
will
do
so
the
democratic
leadership
in
the
house
has
sensibly
concluded
that
impeachment
proceedings
could
backfire
politically
there
is
nothing
in
the
new
report
that
will
suddenly
persuade
republicans
in
the
senate
to
abandon
the
president
it
is
nonetheless
an
extraordinary
document
you
can
read
the
whole
thing
for
yourself
here
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
