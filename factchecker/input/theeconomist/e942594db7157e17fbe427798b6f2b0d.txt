will
the
democrats
green
schemes
make
any
difference
climate
issue
presidential
candidates
are
competing
to
show
off
their
environmental
ambitions
earlier
this
month
dozens
of
teenagers
gathered
in
a
new
york
city
park
to
paint
they
were
preparing
for
the
climate
strike
they
would
attend
on
september
th
one
of
the
rallies
to
be
held
in
more
than
countries
around
the
world
the
students
made
cardboard
waves
to
signify
rising
sea
levels
and
emblazoned
banners
with
demands
for
action
i
want
you
to
act
as
if
our
house
is
on
fire
because
it
is
one
sign
read
america
has
stood
out
to
date
for
being
the
largest
contributor
to
climate
change
and
for
its
leaders
reluctance
to
do
much
about
it
in
president
donald
trump
announced
that
america
would
withdraw
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
in
which
countries
pledged
to
limit
the
average
rise
in
temperatures
to
well
below
c.
in
the
past
four
weeks
alone
his
administration
has
loosened
regulation
of
methane
said
it
would
revoke
california's
right
to
set
emissions
standards
for
cars
and
rolled
back
rules
on
efficient
light
bulbs
i
look
better
under
an
incandescent
light
mr
trump
quipped
without
supporting
evidence
but
where
the
young
lead
a
growing
number
are
following
those
americans
who
think
global
warming
is
real
outnumber
those
who
do
not
by
more
than
five
to
one
for
the
first
time
climate
change
has
become
a
prominent
issue
in
a
democratic
presidential
campaign
on
september
th
cnn
spent
seven
hours
asking
democratic
contenders
what
they
would
do
about
it
candidates
are
tripping
over
themselves
to
convey
their
plans
ambition
from
joe
biden's
trn
proposal
for
a
clean-energy
revolution
to
bernie
sanders's
trn
nationwide
mobilisation
the
democrats
last
serious
legislative
climate
proposal
came
a
decade
ago
edward
markey
and
henry
waxman
two
congressmen
introduced
a
cap-and-trade
bill
originally
a
conservative
idea
cap-and-trade
puts
a
price
on
carbon
and
creates
a
market
in
the
right
to
emit
the
bill
passed
the
house
and
foundered
in
the
senate
climate
policies
have
had
greater
success
on
the
state
level
more
than
half
of
states
have
targets
for
clean
energy
these
policies
coupled
with
tax
credits
for
wind
and
solar
power
have
helped
spur
a
rush
of
investment
in
renewables
america's
shale
bonanza
has
created
a
glut
of
inexpensive
gas
that
has
been
the
main
force
putting
coal
plants
out
of
business
wind
and
solar
farms
have
become
cheap
enough
in
many
instances
to
outcompete
even
gas
democrats
are
now
presenting
broader
national
plans
for
several
reasons
warmer
oceans
are
linked
to
the
stronger
hurricanes
like
harvey
sandy
and
maria
that
have
battered
america's
coasts
last
year
three
wildfires
in
california
killed
people
and
caused
more
than
bn
in
damage
mr
trump's
own
director
of
national
intelligence
warned
that
climate
change
and
ecological
degradation
by
fuelling
competition
for
resources
and
social
discontent
pose
a
security
threat
and
yet
the
administration
has
ignored
or
tried
to
rubbish
such
warnings
which
is
another
reason
for
the
spike
of
interest
in
climate
on
the
left
the
pew
research
centre
reports
that
of
americans
view
climate
change
as
a
major
threat
up
from
in
among
democrats
the
share
is
the
contenders
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
are
also
responding
to
the
green
new
deal
a
proposal
unveiled
in
february
by
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
a
new
congresswoman
and
mr
markey
now
a
senator
the
resolution
calls
for
an
economy
with
net-zero
emissions
that
is
sucking
as
much
carbon
dioxide
out
of
the
atmosphere
as
it
puts
in
and
a
broader
social
transformation
with
universal
health
care
and
guaranteed
jobs
the
plans
proposed
by
the
top
candidates
for
the
democratic
nomination
are
more
detailed
than
this
mr
sanders's
plan
is
the
most
costly
but
elizabeth
warren
mr
biden's
closest
competitor
would
spend
trn
the
leading
contenders
aspire
to
net
zero
emissions
by
if
not
before
they
would
phase
out
subsidies
for
fossil
fuels
and
increase
spending
on
research
into
technologies
such
as
energy
storage
today's
batteries
cannot
balance
the
variable
power
from
the
sun
and
wind
over
long
periods
most
candidates
propose
ways
to
support
cleaner
power
abroad
these
include
sticks
taxes
on
goods
from
countries
without
robust
climate
policies
for
example
as
well
as
carrots
such
as
aid
for
zero-emissions
electricity
in
poor
countries
to
counter
china's
support
for
coal
three
candidates
kamala
harris
pete
buttigieg
and
julian
castro
support
a
carbon
tax
or
fee
which
economists
like
for
its
ability
to
spur
lower
emissions
across
the
economy
without
trying
to
anticipate
the
success
of
any
given
technology
four
former
federal
reserve
chairmen
and
nobel-prize-winning
economists
advocate
a
carbon
tax
whose
proceeds
are
distributed
to
americans
in
equal
lump
sums
this
also
has
the
backing
of
exxonmobil
total
and
other
oil
giants
mr
biden
and
mr
sanders
seem
to
favour
a
carbon
tax
too
though
their
plans
are
less
explicit
ms
warren
would
consider
a
tax
but
has
proposed
a
clean
energy
standard
requiring
electricity
generators
buildings
and
cars
to
bring
emissions
to
zero
this
would
not
span
the
economy
as
a
carbon
price
would
but
it
caps
emissions
for
certain
sectors
and
has
the
political
benefit
of
obscuring
costs
democrats
broader
goals
sometimes
clash
with
their
environmental
ones
top
candidates
espouse
plans
to
support
american
manufacturing
of
clean
technology
even
though
the
deployment
of
renewable
energy
has
benefited
so
much
from
cheap
batteries
and
solar
panels
made
in
asia
ms
warren
would
require
products
with
technology
from
federally
funded
research
to
be
made
in
america
with
union
labour
probably
increasing
its
cost
the
main
feature
of
her
green
marshall
plan
is
bn
of
federal
spending
to
help
other
countries
buy
such
american
tech
this
emphasis
on
jobs
would
risk
making
zero-carbon
power
more
expensive
slowing
its
take-up
mr
sanders
and
ms
warren
would
also
ban
nuclear
power
which
produces
no
greenhouse
gases
michael
bloomberg
a
former
mayor
of
new
york
who
has
spent
a
fortune
campaigning
for
the
closure
of
american
coal
plants
finds
most
democrats
proposals
maddening
what
on
earth
have
any
of
these
people
done
to
have
a
cogent
plan
that
is
doable
he
asks
climate
policy
should
be
made
palatable
especially
to
those
most
affected
by
a
fast
shift
to
clean
power
in
los
angeles
this
year
dismayed
workers
at
gas
plants
almost
scuttled
the
mayor's
plan
to
expand
solar
power
but
the
biggest
risk
to
a
better
policy
comes
from
lack
of
support
partly
from
democrats
in
coal-
and
gas-producing
states
like
west
virginia's
joe
manchin
and
mainly
from
republicans
pew's
polling
shows
that
just
of
republicans
consider
climate
change
a
major
threat
there
are
some
signs
of
a
generational
conflict
within
the
republican
party
that
could
eventually
lead
to
change
among
millennial
conservatives
say
that
climate
change
is
having
at
least
some
effect
on
america
more
than
support
expanding
the
use
of
wind
and
solar
power
alex
flint
a
longtime
senate
staffer
conducts
polls
and
focus
groups
to
help
advise
republicans
on
climate
change
in
one
swing
district
he
found
that
half
of
all
conservatives
were
more
likely
to
support
a
republican
incumbent
working
to
limit
climate
change
the
trend
was
particularly
pronounced
among
conservative
women
the
rhetoric
of
some
republicans
has
started
to
change
too
i
didn't
come
to
congress
to
argue
with
a
thermometer
congressman
matt
gaetz
declared
earlier
this
year
lindsey
graham
a
senator
from
south
carolina
insists
republicans
owe
it
to
the
country
to
have
an
alternative
to
the
green
new
deal
but
partisanship
is
working
against
this
shift
the
green
new
deal
has
prompted
some
republicans
to
portray
climate
policies
as
socialist
schemes
to
ban
hamburgers
for
now
those
republicans
who
worry
about
the
climate
venture
no
further
than
advocating
for
more
r
d
spending
as
lamar
alexander
mr
graham
and
lisa
murkowski
do
in
the
senate
democrats
view
these
proposals
warily
republican
support
for
long-term
research
can
give
the
impression
of
action
but
can
sap
efforts
to
deploy
the
technologies
available
now
only
two
of
the
republicans
in
congress
favour
a
carbon
tax
one
of
them
francis
rooney
has
held
town-hall
meetings
and
lunches
in
his
district
to
explain
himself
to
conservative
constituents
but
he
says
it
is
tough
going
climate
scepticism
he
says
is
identified
as
conservative
republican
doctrine
that
is
despite
republican-leaning
bits
of
the
country
being
at
greatest
risk
see
chart
eventually
more
republicans
may
support
action
as
the
effects
of
climate
change
become
clear
by
then
however
the
damage
would
be
even
harder
to
reverse
correction
september
th
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
stated
that
there
were
more

rallies
being
held
worldwide
in
fact
rallies
are
being
held
in
more
than
countries
sorry
china's
