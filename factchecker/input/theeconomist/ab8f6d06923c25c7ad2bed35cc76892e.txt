why
america's
biggest
charities
are
owned
by
pharmaceutical
companies
their
generosity
helps
their
bottom
line
when
a
patient
in
need
of
a
drug
in
america
goes
to
fulfil
their
prescription
the
price
they
have
to
pay
can
vary
wildly
for
generic
off-patent
drugs
prices
are
usually
low
for
the
uninsured
and
free
for
those
with
insurance
but
for
newer
patent-protected
therapies
prices
can
be
as
high
as
several
thousand
dollars
per
month
those
without
insurance
may
end
up
facing
these
lofty
list
prices
even
those
with
coverage
will
often
have
to
fork
out
some
of
the
cost
called
a
co-payment
while
their
insurance
covers
the
rest
these
co-payments
which
for
the
most
expensive
drugs
can
themselves
be
prohibitively
high
can
act
as
a
deterrent
to
collecting
a
prescription
into
this
gap
a
new
type
of
charity
has
emerged
one
that
offers
to
make
your
co-payment
for
you
they
come
in
two
main
types
independent
ones
like
the
patient
advocate
foundation
which
spent
m
on
co-payments
in
and
co-pay
charities
affiliated
with
drugmakers
themselves
according
to
public
tax
filings
for
the
last
year
for
which
data
are
available
total

the
largest

operating
in
america

bn
the
charity

by
abbvie

taken

the
third-largest

in

its
competitors

johnson

conglomerate

the
fifth-largest
half
of
america's
largest
charities
are
affiliated
with
pharmaceutical
companies
not
everyone
qualifies
for
their
help
unsurprisingly
pharma-affiliated
charities
fund
co-payments
only
on
prescriptions
for
drugs
that
they
manufacture
there
is
often
an
income
threshold
too
which
excludes
the
richest
americans
though
it
is
usually
set
quite
high
at
around
five
times
the
household
poverty
line
they
are
prohibited
from
funding
co-payments
for
those
on
medicaid
which
helps
the
poor
and
medicare
which
helps
the
elderly
by
the
anti-kickback
statute
which
prevents
private
companies
from
inducing
people
to
use
government
services
those
patients
can
accept
co-pay
support
from
independent
charities
such
as
the
patient
advocate
foundation
the
impact
of
these
charities
is
large
and
growing
most
of
them
are
less
than
years
old
in
just
five
drugmakers
operated
charities
spending
a
total
of
m
that
had
risen
fold
to
bn
by
according
to
ronny
gal
an
analyst
at
berstein
a
research
firm
the
co-payment
on
the
price
of
a
drug
is
usually
just
of
the
cost
the
pharmaceutical
company
ultimately
charges
to
the
insurance
provider
this
would
mean
that
bn
if
it
were
all
spent
on
co-payments
could
earn
drugmakers
bn
in
revenues
which
would
account
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
total
drug
spending
in
america
pharmaceutical
companies
will
often
claim
that
helping
patients
with
their
co-payments
is
a
way
of
making
costly
drugs
more
accessible
but
it
has
the
fortunate
consequence
of
making
their
customers
price-insensitive
because
insurance
companies
will
often
use
high
co-payments
to
nudge
their
customers
into
opting
for
generics
over
costlier
branded
drugs
no
co-pay
no
incentive
to
save
money
say
a
patient
is
prescribed
a
statin
a
type
of
drug
to
lower
cholesterol
which
has
proved
useful
in
reducing
heart
disease
they
could
take
lipitor
a
branded
drug
manufactured
by
pfizer
with
a
list
price
of
around
per
month
but
a
generic
atorvastatin
has
also
recently
become
available
for
just
per
month
in
the
absence
of
help
from
a
charity
a
patient
with
private
insurance
would
probably
be
able
to
get
atorvastatin
free
but
would
have
to
pay
some
of
the
cost
for
lipitor
with
help
from
pfizer's
co-pay
charity
both
are
free
it
is
entirely
to
their
advantage
because
consumers
only
care
about
what
it
costs
them
says
adriane
fugh-berman
of
georgetown
university
it's
not
charity
it's
cheating
there
is
also
evidence
that
pharmaceutical
companies
bump
up
the
scope
of
their
co-payment
programmes
shortly
after
they
increase
drug
prices
when
martin
shkreli
the
former
boss
of
turing
pharmaceuticals
who
has
since
been
imprisoned
for
securities
fraud
increased
the
price
of
daraprim
fold
in
he
also
donated
to
a
fund
to
cover
co-pays
for
patients
with
toxoplasmosis
a
disease
treated
using
daraprim
the
ability
of
insurance
companies
to
push
these
price
increases
back
onto
drugmakers
by
raising
co-payments
is
limited
american
authorities
are
trying
to
curb
the
effects
these
charities
may
be
having
on
prices
in
california
in
a
bill
was
passed
banning
companies
from
providing
co-pay
assistance
in
some
situations
such
as
if
a
patient's
insurance
company
offered
a
drug
on
a
lower
cost
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
america's
drug
regulator
had
deemed
therapeutically
identical
or
when
the
active
ingredient
is
available
over-the-counter
at
a
lower
cost
the

exchange
commission
sec
is
also
looking
more
closely
at
independent
charities
that
are
sometimes
sponsored
by
pharmaceutical
firms

lundbeck

using
co-pay
charities
to
support
high
prices
is
good
for
business
but
charitable
contributions
foster
healthy
profits
in
another
way
too
they
are
tax-deductible
the
corporate
tax
codes
of
most
countries
allow
companies
to
deduct
the
cost
of
any
charitable
giving
from
pre-tax
profits
but
in
america
the
system
is
more
generous
says
jason
factor

lawyer

gottlieb

companies
that
give
products
for
the
benefit
of
