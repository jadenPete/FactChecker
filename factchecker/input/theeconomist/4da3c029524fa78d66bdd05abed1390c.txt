rural
minnesota's
democratic
voters
are
shifting
allegiances
republicans
see
an
opening
with
voters
in
regions
like
the
iron
range
support
for
miners
is
ubiquitous
in
eveleth
minnesota
hand-painted
signs
on
roadsides
and
placards
in
bars
and
other
businesses
proclaim
mining
to
be
the
region's
lifeblood
bob
vlaisavljevich
the
mayor
of
this
small
town
in
the
north-eastern
corner
of
the
state
lauds
taconite
and
other
minerals
as
the
spine
of
the
local
economy
the
mining
rank
and
file
think
like
me
he
says
recounting
the
story
of
his
grandfather
who
migrated
to
the
area
from
serbia
a
century
ago
loyalty
to
resource
extraction
endures
in
eveleth
and
across
four
small
mining
cities
called
the
quad
cities
in
a
region
known
as
the
iron
range
but
much
else
is
shifting
mr
vlaisavljevich
who
was
first
elected
in
recalls
how
the
quad
cities
had
some
miners
in
the
s
that
has
dwindled
to
just
their
well-paid
jobs
once
sustained
a
roaring
regional
economy
eveleth
alone
boasted
several
car
dealerships
jewellery
and
furniture
shops
restaurants
and
houses
selling
like
crazy
no
more
back
then
it
was
hard
to
find
parking
says
the
mayor
gesturing
to
a
wide
near-deserted
street
by
the
town
hall
mr
vlaisavljevich
has
also
changed
he
and
his
family
were
long
proud
democrats
like
most
on
the
range
he
voted
for
barack
obama
as
president
today
he
has
a
placard
praising
donald
trump
glued
to
his
mayoral
desk
he
points
to
a
christmas
card
sent
from
the
president
on
his
wall
on
the
desk
a
joke
roll
of
toilet
paper
bears
an
image
of
hillary
clinton
you
know
what
i
am
i'm
a
democrat
that
supports
republican
policies
he
says
describing
his
political
transition
the
democrats
are
two
parties
in
one
and
the
left
has
abandoned
the
middle
class
he
lauds
republican
tariffs
on
imported
steel
saying
that
would
once
have
been
a
democratic
policy
he
thinks
democrats
are
soft
on
immigration
he
resents
rich
big-city
folk
in
minneapolis
for
selfishly
blocking
plans
to
establish
open-pit
mines
for
copper
and
other
materials
now
it's
a
survival
thing
with
all
the
environmental
groups
they
want
to
stop
all
that
mining
in
nearby
hibbing
todd
hall
is
also
from
a
mining
family
of
fervent
democrats
but
he
and
his
wife
kirstie
hall
have
jumped
party
calling
liberal-minded
democrats
out
of
touch
the
working
class
don't
recognise
the
democratic
party
claims
mrs
hall
she
calls
a
statewide
plan
to
increase
petrol
taxes
an
emblem
of
neglect
for
rural
concerns
the
halls
are
also
troubled
by
an
influx
of
somali
refugees
to
other
towns
in
the
state
so
for
three
years
she
has
organised
a
republican
float
for
hibbing's
annual
street
parade
at
first
she
says
the
float
was
met
with
no
more
than
boos
and
jeers
but
sympathy
is
growing
she
says
mr
hall
says
it
was
once
socially
unacceptable
to
admit
to
supporting
republicans
but
that
the
taboo
is
lifting
mr
vlaisavljevich
says
local
union
leaders
know
rank-and-file
members
are
drifting
to
support
that
guy
meaning
mr
trump
jennifer
carnahan
who
leads
the
republican
party
in
minnesota
calls
the
range
ripe
for
expansion
union
workers
need
to
take
advantage
of
resources
create
jobs
to
reinvigorate
the
area
she
says
using
the
sort
of
language
long
deployed
by
democratic
leaders
she
says
state
republicans
can
emulate
a
strategy
that
worked
in
neighbouring
wisconsin
by
winning
over
small
towns
and
blue-collar
voters
even
if
cities
remain
out
of
reach
but
could
gains
in
the
iron
range
help
to
tip
minnesota
republican
in
the
presidential
election
mr
trump
says
he
is
eyeing
the
state
he
came
within
only
votes
a
margin
of
taking
minnesota's
ten
electoral
votes
in
when
republicans
won
of
the
state's
counties
mrs
carnahan
wants
mr
trump
to
hold
three
big
rallies
across
the
north
south
and
west
of
minnesota
which
she
says
could
help
put
the
state
in
play
republicans
did
poorly
last
year
in
the
mid-terms
especially
in
suburbs
but
they
flipped
the
th
congressional
district
which
includes
the
iron
range
larry
jacobs
of
the
university
of
minnesota
agrees
a
tight
contest
is
likely
calling
the
state
a
toss
up
that
is
a
remarkable
judgment
considering
democrats
have
won
the
state
in
successive
presidential
elections
since
and
rarely
bother
to
campaign
much
there
he
points
to
frequent
republican
successes
in
statewide
legislative
races
farmers
in
the
south
and
west
of
the
state
along
with
miners
in
the
iron
range
are
leaving
the
democratic
fold
he
says
while
urban
and
suburban
voters
flock
to
it
much
is
in
flux
mr
trump's
attacks
on
ilhan
omar
which
have
raised
the
standing
of
the
first-time
congresswoman
of
somali
descent
in
minneapolis
have
also
helped
to
expose
an
urban-rural
fault
line
among
democrats
says
mr
jacobs
ms
omar
who
can
be
outspoken
in
criticising
mr
trump
and
his
policies
is
intensely
popular
among
her
urban
constituents
but
in
small-town
blue-collar
and
overwhelmingly
white
places
like
eveleth
and
hibbing
her
high
profile
makes
some
uneasy
the
state
is
white
and
has
a
relatively
fast-growing
non-white
population
some
voters
beyond
cities
anxious
about
racial
change
could
fall
in
with
mr
trump
how
might
democrats
respond
heidi
heitkamp
a
senator
in
north
dakota
until
this
year
is
leading
a
national
effort
called
one
country
to
persuade
rural
voters
that
democrats
have
their
interests
at
heart
she
cites
the
iron
range
as
typical
of
where
the
party
must
pay
more
attention
democrats
failed
to
show
up
and
listen
to
legitimate
concerns
in
such
places
she
says
the
party
should
offer
a
message
of
infrastructure
investment
and
of
tapping
rural
labour
for
white-collar
jobs
she
says
even
if
it
won't
commit
to
reviving
mining
ms
heitkamp
also
wants
democrats
to
change
their
tone
when
addressing
voters
in
towns
like
eveleth
i
think
miners
want
to
hear
the
truth
right
now
rural
america
depends
on
trade
aid
but
there
is
a
real
high
bullshit
factor
she
says
meaning
politicians
have
not
been
straight
when
explaining
that
a
changing
economy
requires
government
help
in
retraining
for
new
jobs
mr
trump
may
make
simple
vows
to
restore
old
mining
work
but
democrats
could
explain
how
tourism
technology
engineering
health
care
and
other
industries
can
bring
economic
revival
such
messages
won't
win
over
all
rural
voters
she
admits
but
they
are
better
than
silence
rural
america
is
movable
she
argues
pointing
to
the
appeal
of
laura
kelly
the
democratic
governor
of
kansas
in
suburbs
small
towns
and
cities
similar
successes
may
only
be
replicated
if
candidates
show
up
in
places
like
eveleth
it
is
a
game
of
inches
not
yards
says
ms
heitkamp
if
democrats
fail
to
play
republicans
will
make
the
running
on
the
range
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
