parts
of
america
may
already
be
facing
recession
slowdowns
in
housing
construction
and
manufacturing
are
ominous
it
can
be
hard
to
know
when
isolated
announcements
become
something
more
since
last
november
general
motors
has
cut
several
thousand
factory
jobs
at
plants
across
the
midwest
in
early
august
us
steel
said
it
would
lay
off

michigan
sales

camper
vans
dropped
by
in
the
months
ending
in
july
threatening
the
livelihoods
of
thousands
of
workers
in
indiana
where
many
are
made
factory
workers
are
not
the
only
ones
on
edge
lowes
a
retailer
recently
said
it
would
slash
thousands
of
jobs
halliburton
an
oil-services
firm
is
cutting
too
in
any
given
month
even
at
the
height
of
a
boom
more
than

americans
leave
a
job
nearly
m
are
laid
off
most
of
the
time
however
overall
employment
grows
but
not
all
the
time
america
may
or
may
not
be
lurching
towards
a
recession
now
for
the
time
being
employment
and
output
continue
to
grow
but
in
the
corners
of
the
economy
where
trouble
often
rears
its
head
earliest
there
are
disconcerting
portents
recessions
are
synchronised
declines
in
economic
activity
weak
demand
typically
shows
up
in
nearly
every
sector
in
an
economy
but
some
parts
of
the
economic
landscape
are
more
cyclical
than
others
that
is
they
have
bigger
booms
and
deeper
slumps
certain
bits
tend
to
crash
in
the
earliest
stages
of
a
downturn
whereas
others
weaken
later
every
downturn
is
different
those
caused
by
a
spike
in
oil
prices
for
example
progress
through
an
economy
in
a
different
way
from
those
precipitated
by
financial
crises
or
tax
increases
but
most
recessions
follow
a
cycle
of
tightening
monetary
policy
during
which
the
federal
reserve
raises
interest
rates
in
order
to
prevent
inflation
from
running
too
high
the
first
rumblings
of
downturns
usually
appear
in
areas
in
which
growth
depends
heavily
on
the
availability
of
affordable
credit
housing
is
often
among
the
first
sectors
to
wobble
as
rates
on
mortgages
go
up
this
chokes
off
new
housing
demand
in
a
paper
published
in
edward
leamer
an
economist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
declared
simply
that
housing
is
the
business
cycle
recent
history
agrees
residential
investment
in
america
began
to
drop
two
years
before
the
start
of
the
great
recession
and
employment
in
the
industry
peaked
in
april
conditions
in
housing
markets
were
rather
exceptional
at
the
time
but
in
the
downturn
before
that
typically
associated
with
the
implosion
of
the
dotcom
boom
housing
also
sounded
an
early
alarm
employment
in
residential
construction
peaked
precisely
a
year
before
the
start
of
the
downturn
and
now
residential
investment
has
been
shrinking
since
the
beginning
of
employment
in
the
housing
sector
has
fallen
since
march
things
may
yet
turn
around
the
fed
reduced
its
main
interest
rate
in
july
and
could
cut
again
in
september
if
buyers
respond
quickly
it
could
give
builders
and
the
economy
a
lift
but
housing
is
not
the
only
warning
sign
manufacturing
activity
also
tends
to
falter
before
other
parts
of
an
economy
when
interest-rate
increases
push
up
the
value
of
the
dollar
exporters
competitiveness
in
foreign
markets
suffers
durable
goods
like
cars
or
appliances
pile
up
when
credit
is
costlier
in
the
previous
cycle
employment
in
durable-goods
manufacturing
peaked
in
june
about
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
onset
of
recession
this
year
has
been
another
brutal
one
for
industry
an
index
of
purchasing
managers
activity
registered
a
decline
in
august
since
last
december
manufacturing
output
has
fallen
by
rather
ominously
hours
worked
considered
to
be
a
leading
economic
indicator
are
declining
some
of
this
is
linked
to
president
donald
trump's
trade
wars
which
have
hurt
manufacturers
worldwide
but
not
all
domestic
vehicle
sales
have
fallen
in
recent
months
suggesting
that
americans
are
getting
more
nervous
about
making
big
purchases
in
some
sectors
technological
change
makes
it
difficult
to
interpret
the
data
soaring
employment
in
oil
industries
used
to
be
a
bad
sign
for
the
american
economy
since
hiring
in
the
sector
tended
to
accompany
consumer-crushing
spikes
in
oil
prices
but
america
now
produces
almost
as
much
oil
as
it
consumes
thanks
to
the
shale-oil
revolution
a
recent
fall
in
employment
and
hours
in
oil
extraction
may
be
a
bad
omen
rather
than
a
good
one
by
contrast
a
fall
in
retail
employment
was
once
unambiguously
bad
news
but
retail
work
in
america
has
been
in
decline
for
two
and
a
half
years
ongoing
shrinkage
may
not
signal
recession
but
the
structural
economic
shift
towards
e-commerce
other
signals
are
less
ambiguous
in
recent
decades
employment
in
temporary
help
services
mostly
staffing
agencies
has
reliably
peaked
about
a
year
before
the
onset
of
recession
the
turnaround
in
temporary
employment
in
was
among
the
green
shoots
taken
to
augur
a
long-awaited
labour-market
recovery
since
december
it
has
fallen
by
jobs
even
if
america
avoids
a
recession
the
present
slowdown
may
prove
politically
consequential
weakness
in
some
sectors
like
retail
is
spread
fairly
evenly
across
the
country
but
in
others
like
construction
or
especially
manufacturing
the
nagging
pain
of
the
moment
is
more
concentrated
