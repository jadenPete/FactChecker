donald
trump
unveils
space
command
the
space
force
which
it
will
one
day
instruct
may
be
some
time
in
the
shadow
of
the
rocky
mountains
at
peterson
air
force
base
in
colorado
springs
an
officer
of
the
us
air
force
space
command
clutches
a
metallic
object
scarcely
larger
than
a
rubik's
cube
if
we
lose
this
cubesat
in
orbit
he
explains
it
could
be
someone
else's
attack
vehicle
in
the
past
satellite
operators
like
those
controlling
gps
satellites
from
nearby
schriever
air
force
base
would
have
blamed
problems
on
space
weather
or
communication
glitches
now
their
minds
leap
to
hacking
jamming
and
deliberate
collision
and
so
on
august
th
after
congressional
instruction
a
year
ago
president
donald
trump
unveiled
a
new
space
command
with
operational
control
of
nearly
all
american
space
assets
he
promised
that
a
space
force
the
first
new
military
service
since
the
air
force
was
established
in
would
follow
the
distinction
between
command
and
service
is
important
since
the
goldwater-nichols
act
in
america's
armed
forces
have
been
cleaved
into
two
parts
individual
services
train
and
equip
their
respective
forces
but
do
not
send
them
into
battle
instead
so-called
combatant
commands
divvy
the
world
up
into
six
geographical
chunks
and
five
functional
areas
such
as
cyber
special
operations
and
now
space
the
head
of
each
one
controls
all
the
forces
within
his
or
her
fief
whatever
their
service
thus
the
admiral
who
runs
the
indo-pacific
command
in
hawaii
rules
over
infantrymen
in
south
korea
air-force
pilots
in
japan
and
marines
in
australia
the
system
was
designed
specifically
to
avoid
the
sorts
of
inter-service
quarrels
that
contributed
to
a
botched
hostage-rescue
mission
in
iran
in
for
some
years
space
sat
awkwardly
in
this
structure
there
was
a
dedicated
space
command
between
and
but
after
the
september
th
attacks
an
emphasis
on
homeland
defence
led
to
the
creation
of
a
new
northern
command
covering
north
america
space
was
kicked
into
strategic
command
whose
primary
job
is
nuclear
weapons
there
was
some
logic
to
this
america's
most
vital
satellites
are
those
which
watch
for
missile
launches
detect
nuclear
detonations
and
pass
orders
from
the
president
to
nuclear
forces
but
as
space
threats
seemed
to
grow
china's
test
of
an
anti-satellite
missile
in
was
the
first
by
any
country
since
the
arrangement
looked
problematic
in
a
review
of
space
policy
by
the
obama
administration
concluded
that
it
was
critical
for
america
to
be
able
to
identify
threats
in
space
and
counter
other
countries
anti-satellite
weapons
the
trump
administration
intensified
public
warnings
of
those
vulnerabilities
in
february
general
john
hyten
commander
of
strategic
command
said
that
space
was
his
third
priority
after
the
modernisation
of
nuclear
forces
and
their
command
and
control
it
really
is
important
to
have
someone
who
comes
to
work
every
day
and
that's
all
they
think
about
space
operations
space
threats
and
defending
our
space
assets
says
matthew
donovan
the
acting
secretary
of
the
air
force
that
job
now
falls
to
general
john
jay
raymond
pictured
notably
he
will
have
wartime
control
of
the
national
reconnaissance
office's
fleet
of
highly
classified
spy
satellites
if
they
come
under
attack
not
everyone
is
convinced
that
the
reorganisation
is
urgently
needed
in
an
essay
published
in
july
on
war
on
the
rocks
a
website
brian
weeden
a
former
space-operations
officer
with
the
air
force
who
is
now
at
the
secure
world
foundation
a
think-tank
warned
that
general
raymond
might
wind
up
clashing
with
geographical-area
commanders
if
for
instance
china
jams
american
gps
signals
during
a
war
over
taiwan
space
command
and
indo-pacific
command
may
disagree
on
how
best
to
respond
the
pentagon
is
examining
how
such
co-ordination
will
work
mr
weeden
also
worries
that
a
dedicated
command
might
encourage
those
fixated
on
future
battles
in
space
satellite-on-satellite
combat
rather
than
the
more
pressing
task
of
using
devices
orbiting
earth
to
help
commanders
wage
war
on
its
surface
such
as
by
sharpening
gps
signals
or
redirecting
spy
satellites
before
space
command
can
get
stuck
into
cosmic
battles
a
more
conventional
war
over
federal
dollars
has
to
be
fought
mr
trump
did
not
disclose
which
of
six
shortlisted
bases
across
three
states
alabama
california
and
colorado
would
accommodate
space
command
the
debate
is
then
likely
to
shift
to
mr
trump's
space
force
which
like
the
other
services
would
train
and
equip
the
space
warfighters
as
the
pentagon
calls
them
for
general
raymond's
command
the
white
house
has
proposed
a
m-a-year
service
that
would
sit
demurely
within
the
air
force
much
as
the
marine
corps
is
a
component
of
the
navy
mr
weeden
says
that
this
not
space
command
ought
to
have
been
the
priority
he
points
out
that
there
is
a
pressing
need
to
train
more
space
experts
over
a
third
of
space
billets
at
strategic
command
are
said
to
be
unfilled
congress
is
broadly
in
favour
of
the
force
although
the
senate
and
house
are
haggling
over
details
the
senate
wants
to
put
off
creating
a
fully-fledged
service
for
at
least
a
year
to
avoid
bureaucratic
bloat
the
democrat-controlled
house
prefers
a
less
pugnacious
label
space
corps
whatever
it
is
called
the
aim
is
to
inculcate
a
galactic
esprit
de
corps
when
people
join
the
marines
it's
not
about
joining
the
navy
says
stephen
kitay
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
defence
for
space
policy
somebody
joins
the
marines
and
that's
in
their
culture
and
dna
and
ethos
and
we're
looking
to
create
that
for
space
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
