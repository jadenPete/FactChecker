is
this
man
the
missing
link
in
the
mueller
investigation
or
is
he
an
attention-seeking
mythmaker
or
could
he
be
both
these
things
the
first
time
roger
stone
talked
to
donald
trump
about
running
for
president
was
in
we're
sitting
in
the
office
he's
looking
at
the
newspaper
which
he
did
more
then
than
now
and
he
says
jesus
christ
george
bush
and
mike
dukakis
how
fuckin
pathetic
is
that
how
fuckin
pathetic
he
says
you
ever
shake
hands
with
george
bush
i
said
no
what's
it
like
he
said
let
me
show
you
dead-fish
handshake
he
said
and
this
dukakis
what
is
he
i
said
maybe
you
should
run
he
says
i'll
tell
you
this
i'm
not
interested
in
running
but
if
i
did
run
i'd
win
mr
stone's
role
in
mr
trump's
eventual
victory
has
been
a
source
of
speculation
ever
since
november
on
january
th
he
was
arrested
at
his
home
in
fort
lauderdale
and
indicted
by
robert
mueller
the
special
counsel
on
seven
counts
including
obstructing
an
official
proceeding
witness-tampering
and
making
false
statements
about
his
communication
with
wikileaks
and
the
trump
campaign
at
his
arraignment
mr
stone
in
democratic
blue
suit
tie
and
uncharacteristically
flabby
pocket-square
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
seven
counts
he
left
the
courthouse
through
throngs
of
supporters
and
detractors
waving
signs
that
read
dirty
traitor
lock
him
up
and
roger
stone
did
nothing
wrong
across
the
street
was
a
huge
inflatable
rat
with
a
blond
hairpiece
mueller-watchers
had
awaited
mr
stone's
indictment
eagerly
the
investigation
was
set
up
to
look
at
links
and
or
co-ordination
between
the
russian
government
and
the
trump
campaign
many
links
have
already
been
revealed
in
indictments
but
co-ordination
has
proved
more
elusive
mr
stone
who
both
worked
on
the
campaign
for
a
while
and
seemed
to
have
advance
knowledge
of
the
emails
stolen
from
the
democratic
national
committee
by
russian
military
intelligence
the
gru
looked
as
if
he
might
be
the
missing
link
cnn
was
so
sure
mr
stone's
indictment
was
coming
that
the
network
had
a
camera
team
outside
mr
stone's
house
when
the
fbi
turned
up
to
arrest
him
on
a
similar
hunch
the
economist
had
lunch
with
him
in
december
in
fort
lauderdale
asked
then
if
he
was
worried
about
the
special
counsel's
investigation
into
links
between
russia
and
mr
trump's
campaign
he
scoffed
worry
i
don't
worry
i
make
other
people
worry
mr
stone's
reputation
as
the
kind
of
political
operative
imagined
by
screenwriters
owes
much
to
his
own
mythmaking
for
a
race
he
worked
on
early
in
his
career
in
his
home
state
of
connecticut
he
and
other
volunteers
paced
the
platforms
at
a
commuter
railway
station
passing
out
flyers
with
hot
coffee
in
the
mornings
and
freshly
mixed
martinis
when
the
passengers
returned
in
the
evenings
his
break
came
when
working
for
richard
nixon
a
politician
mr
stone
admires
so
much
that
he
has
the
th
president's
face
tattooed
between
his
shoulder
blades
man
with
richard
nixon
tattoo
turns
out
to
be
a
criminal
was
the
headline
on
popdust
a
gossip
website
after
the
indictment
in
his
book
about
nixon
he
writes
i
was
drawn
to
richard
nixon
not
because
of
his
philosophy
he
had
none
it
was
his
resilience
and
his
indestructibility
that
attracted
me
mr
stone
says
that
nixon
was
exceptionally
kind
that
he
called
him
on
his
birthday
remembered
his
wife's
and
dogs
names
and
sent
letters
when
his
parents
died
after
tasting
success
of
a
sort
with
nixon
mr
stone
worked
on
ronald
reagan's
ill-starred
presidential
campaign
the
next
year
he
was
elected
president
of
young
republicans
in
a
campaign
managed
by
paul
manafort
convicted
by
mr
mueller's
team
for
felonies
too
numerous
to
list
in
a
paper
that
prizes
concision
when
reagan
won
at
the
second
attempt
mr
stone
set
up
a
lobbying
firm
black
manafort
and
stone
that
became
infamous
for
its
work
for
ferdinand
marcos
in
the
philippines
mobutu
sese
seko
in
zaire
and
jonas
savimbi
in
angola
among
others
the
two
men
parted
ways
after
selling
the
company
in
the
s
they
were
reunited
on
the
trump
campaign
which
mr
manafort
briefly
ran
while
mr
stone
flitted
about
laying
claim
to
an
influence
over
the
candidate
and
tactics
that
was
never
spelled
out
the
indictment
fills
in
some
gaps
it
alleges
that
in
june
and
july
of
after
his
official
role
with
the
campaign
had
ended
mr
stone
informed
senior
trump
campaign
officials
that
he
had
information
indicating
wikileaks
had
documents
whose
release
would
be
damaging
to
the
clinton
campaign
wikileaks
released
its
first
batch
of
emails
on
july
nd
four
days
later
mr
trump
had
nearly
erased
hillary
clinton's
lead
after
the
release
says
the
indictment
a
senior
trump
campaign
official
was
directed
to
contact
stone
about
any
additional
releases
and
what
other
damaging
information
wikileaks
had
regarding
the
clinton
campaign
stone
thereafter
told
the
trump
campaign
about
potential
future
releases
of
damaging
material
by
wikileaks
mr
mueller
names
neither
the
senior
campaign
official
nor
the
person
who
directed
him
or
her
to
contact
mr
stone
according
to
emails
published
by
the
new
york
times
mr
stone
and
stephen
bannon
the
campaign's
chief
executive
exchanged
emails
about
wikileaks
in
early
october
over
lunch
mr
stone
is
acerbic
about
mr
bannon
i
have
trouble
dealing
with
people
who
are
slovenly
says
mr
stone
a
renowned
clothes
horse
he
dressed
down
for
lunch
wearing
a
white
oxford
shirt
and
flat-fronted
trousers
but
did
drop
the
name
of
his
favourite
japanese
tailor
if
you
want
to
know
what
steve
bannon
had
for
lunch
just
look
at
the
front
of
his
shirt
the
indictment
further
alleges
that
mr
stone
made
several
other
false
statements
regarding
the
nature
of
his
communication
with
intermediaries
in
direct
contact
with
julian
assange
the
head
of
wikileaks
and
with
mr
trump's
campaign
the
witness-tampering
charge
stems
from
his
alleged
attempts
to
prevent
one
of
those
intermediaries
from
contradicting
his
testimony
mr
stone
advised
the
witness
to
stonewall
it
plead
the
fifth
and
later
i'm
not
talking
to
the
fbi
and
if
your
sic
smart
you
won't
either
when
the
intermediary
proved
less
tractable
than
he
desired
mr
stone
called
him
a
rat
a
stoolie
you
backstab
your
friends
run
your
mouth
my
lawyers
are
dying
rip
you
to
shreds
sic
he
also
threatened
the
witness's
therapy
dog
bianca
and
suggested
that
he
prepare
to
die
over
lunch
in
december
mr
stone
offered
a
lawyerly
expansive
defence
of
his
conduct
there's
no
evidence
or
proof
and
no
one
can
honestly
say
that
i
had
advance
notice
of
the
source
or
the
content
or
the
exact
release
date
of
the
wikileaks
material
either
stolen
or
i
should
say
allegedly
stolen
and
allegedly
hacked
the
word
exact
in
that
sentence
is
doing
a
great
deal
of
work
otherwise
says
mr
stone
i
am
not
guilty
of
any
other
crime
in
connection
with
the
election
and
besides
i'm
not
really
sure
receiving
material
from
wikileaks
would
have
been
a
crime
had
i
done
so
not
everyone
would
be
so
sanguine
campaign-finance
law
bars
foreign
nationals
from
contributing
and
campaigns
from
soliciting
from
them
money
or
any
thing
of
value
to
an
american
political
campaign
mr
stone
says
that
his
subsequent
testimony
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
another
possible
source
of
legal
trouble
for
him
was
completely
accurate
and
truthful
and
that
any
discrepancy
in
my
testimony
would
be
immaterial
the
indictment
alleges
otherwise
the
committee
asked
mr
stone
whether
he
had
any
documents
concerning
discussions
you
have
had
with
third
parties
about
mr
assange
mr
stone
replied
that
he
did
not
the
indictment
alleges
that
in
fact
he
had
multiple
emails
and
texts
about
mr
assange
including
one
to
a
trump
supporter
from
october
rd
that
read
spoke
to
my
friend
in
london
last
night
presumably
mr
assange
who
lives
at
the
ecuadorean
embassy
there
the
payload
is
still
coming
four
days
later
wikileaks
released
thousands
of
emails
stolen
from
john
podesta
mrs
clinton's
campaign
chairman
mr
trump's
spokesman
said
the
indictment
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
president
and
called
mr
stone
somebody
who
has
been
a
consultant
for
dozens
of
republican
presidents
and
candidates
that
is
true
but
it
conceals
the
duration
and
depth
of
the
relationship
between
messrs
trump
and
stone
they
have
been
close
since
mr
stone
solicited
donations
from
donald
and
his
father
fred
for
reagan's
campaign
in
mr
stone
oversaw
the
creation
of
a
draft
trump
for
president
committee
and
arranged
for
supporters
to
hold
trump
for
president
signs
at
a
speech
mr
trump
gave
in
new
hampshire
mr
stone
recalls
that
the
speech
was
about
how
our
nato
partners
are
ripping
us
off
and
our
trading
partners
are
fucking
us
after
he
was
released
on
bail
mr
stone
spent
the
weekend
talking
to
any
briefly
stationary
television
camera
to
a
local
news
station
in
florida
he
boasted
grinning
there
are
four
phases
of
fame
who
is
roger
stone
get
me
roger
stone
get
me
a
roger
stone-type
who
is
roger
stone
i
guess
i'm
in
phase
two
at
the
moment
outside
the
florida
courthouse
where
he
first
appeared
he
vowed
not
to
testify
against
mr
trump
two
days
later
he
said
he
would
consider
co-operating
with
mr
mueller
whose
case
against
him
he
described
as
thin
as
piss
on
a
rock
he
decried
the
gestapo
tactics
of
his
arrest
though
that
may
have
been
because
federal
agents
who
were
on
furlough
because
of
the
government
shutdown
but
reportedly
volunteered
for
the
job
feared
he
would
destroy
evidence
he
admitted
to
having
made
errors
in
his
testimony
but
said
they
were
inconsequential
within
the
scope
of
this
investigation
asked
whether
he
thought
mr
stone
did
what
was
he
has
been
accused
of
doing
a
former
colleague
was
circumspect
i
don't
know
but
i
think
he
would
have
liked
to
he
always
had
a
way
of
putting
himself
at
the
centre
of
things
and
in
this
case
he
may
have
talked
himself
into
a
jail
sentence
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the

just
re-elected

go
