why
legacy
places
should
be
abolished
giving
the
children
of
alumni
a
leg-up
makes
no
sense
i
am
simply
thrilled
about
all
the
folks
you
were
able
to
admit

charges
brought
against
rich
and
famous
people
who
are
accused
of
illegally
buying
university
places
for
their
children
has
focused
attention
on
an
oddity
in
american
higher
education
that
while
it
was
illegal
for
these
people
to
buy
places
others
can
do
so
quite
legally
this
issue
is
normally
hidden
behind
the
veil
of
the
holistic
admissions
policy
which
selective
universities
run
but
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
in
which
asian-american
plaintiffs
allege
that
harvard's
admissions
system
is
racially
biased
has
thrown
a
light
on
preference
given
to
different
groups
including
legacies
the
children
of
alumni
their
parents
do
not
have
to
fork
out
for
them
to
be
favoured
but
since
alumni
are
universities
principal
source
of
donations
after
foundations
institutions
that
practice
legacy
preference
defend
it
as
essential
a
survey
by
the
harvard
crimson
the
student
newspaper
found
that
of
the
class
of
had
a
close
relation
who
had
been
at
the
university
had
at
least
one
parent
there
nor
is
the
practice
confined
to
the
top
institutions
a
survey
of
admissions
directors
by
inside
higher
ed
found
that
of
those
at
private
universities
used
legacy
preference

it
flies
in
the

on
which
america
was

the
rejection
as

of
the
artificial

based
on

which
had
corrupted

in

of

on

would
yield

they
set
up

which
embedded
legacy
preference
in
the
egalitarianism
of
the
post-war
era
universities
tried
to
get
rid
of
legacies
but
were
defeated
by
passionate
opposition
from
their
alumni
no

money
and
alumni

university
administrators
point
out
that
legacy
applicants
sat

tend
to
be
higher
than
average
not
surprising
since
they
tend
to
be
richer
and
therefore
better-prepared
in
an
interview
with
the
crimson
mr
fitzsimmons
referred
to
legacy
as
a
tip
which
other
things
being
substantially
equal
could
win
an
applicant
a
place
but
recent
data
suggest
it
is
more
than
that
michael
hurwitz
then
at
harvard
calculated
that
controlling
for
all
relevant
characteristics
being
related
to
an
alumnus
of
one
of
america's
top
universities
increased
an
applicant's
chance
threefold

but
as
richard
reeves
of
the
brookings
institution
points
out
they
admit
so
few
poor
people
that
this
is
pocket
change
for
them
according
to

half
of

at

are
fenced

a
study
of
universities
found
that
the
presence
of
legacy
preference
policies
does
not
result
in
significantly
higher
alumni
giving
those
with
legacy
preference
got
more
money
from
alumni
but
that
was
because
they
had
richer
alumni
abandoning
the
practice
might
be
in
the
universities
interest
a
study
into
the
child-cycle
of
alumni
giving
found
that
donations
increased
when
alumni's
children
reached
their
early
teens
and
then
dropped
to
below
their
original
level
when
the
child
was
turned
down
hell
hath
no

like
an

whose

been
scorned
some
institutions
including
the
university
of
california
berkeley
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
and
texas
a
m
have
abandoned
the
practice
more
than
two-thirds
of
americans
are
against
it
mr
kahlenberg
notes
that
universities
are
increasingly
unpopular
among
americans
some
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
idea
that
these
are
liberal
bastions
where
students
are
being
indoctrinated
but
it
is
also
about
the
fact
that
these
are
seen
as
gated
communities
where
the
privileged
protect
their
positions
in
society
a
majority
of
the
admissions
directors
surveyed
by
inside
higher
ed
opposed
it
including
of
those
who
practised
it
the
crimson
wants
it
ended
it
would
make
it
a
happier
place
says
a
harvard
insider
so
many
of
the
students
have
impostor
syndrome
ron
wyden
a
democratic
senator
plans
to
help
legacy
preference
on
its
way
by
introducing
a
bill
to
limit
tax
breaks
on
donations
before
or
while
a
child
is
enrolled
it
is
a
condition
of
tax
exemption
that
a
donor
should
get
no
direct
benefit
from
a
donation
and
although
universities
are
very
careful
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
their
defence
of
legacy
preference
that
it
raises
money
implicitly
admits
the
connection
but
the
likeliest
impetus
for
change
is
the
affirmative-action
trial
at
present
the
universities
can
say
they
take
into
account
lots
of
factors
including
legacies
says
mr
kahlenberg
if
you
no
longer
have
them
for
minorities
then
it
becomes
harder
to
justify
that
indeed
is
what
happened
at
the
university
of
california
and
at
texas
a
m
when
racial
preferences
were
ended
legacy
preferences
looked
even
more
egregiously
unfair
and
were
binned
china's
