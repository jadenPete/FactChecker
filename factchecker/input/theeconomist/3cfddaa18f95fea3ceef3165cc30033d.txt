american
religion
is
starting
to
look
less
exceptional
to
be
young
is
not
quite
heaven
for
anyone
who
studies
americans
and
their
beliefs
the
most
startling
phenomenon
of
recent
times
has
been
the
rise
of
the
religious
nones
about
a
quarter
of
the
total
population
and
about
a
third
of
those
who
became
adults
in
the
new
millennium
identify
with
no
creed
some
new
figures
suggest
the
flight
from
organised
religion
is
even
quicker
than
previously
thought
the
share
of
americans
who
acknowledge
being
members
of
a
religious
group
is
falling
much
faster
than
the
proportion
who
perhaps
loosely
hew
to
one
faith
tradition
or
another
comparing
with
the
last
three
years
of
the
th
century
declared
participants
in
organised
religion
have
plunged
by
nearly
points
to
and
among
millennials
signing
up
to
a
church
is
a
minority
pursuit
according
to
gallup
a
venerable
pollster
membership
of
any
faith
is
plummeting
much
faster
among
democrats
to
than
among
republicans
to
and
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
why
the
closer
the
embrace
between
church
and
the
republican
party
the
less
appealing
faith
becomes
to
those
on
the
left
but
religion-watchers
see
a
vast
generational
change
which
transcends
political
loyalty
and
will
eventually
embrace
politically
conservative
youngsters
too
a
change
towards
what
exactly
according
to
mike
hout
a
sociology
professor
at
new
york
university
what
americans
are
rejecting
is
not
the
transcendent
but
simply
structures
and
organisation
younger
americans
are
more
atomised
and
provisional
in
everything
they
do
from
work
to
relationships
and
that
affects
religious
behaviour
he
finds
it
telling
that
some
polls
suggest
a
steady
to
slightly
rising
belief
in
an
afterlife
but
declining
faith
in
a
christian
heaven
people
often
prefer
things
to
be
vague
americans
in
their
s
have
long
been
less
devout
than
their
seniors
but
in
the
old
days
they
eventually
married
and
brought
their
children
to
church
many
of
today's
young
parents
were
raised
without
a
faith
so
they
have
none
to
go

the

is
