amid
the
opioid
crisis
a
different
drug
comes
roaring
back
deaths
caused
by
meth
use
have
risen
fold
this
decade
london
breed
the
mayor
of
san
francisco
recently
announced
a
new
drugs
task-force
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
mayors
do
this
task
force
though
was
unusual
because
it
was
not
aimed
at
opioids
but
at
methamphetamine
in
meth
overdoses
killed
people
in
the
city
more
than
twice
as
many
as
heroin
open-air
dealing
uninterrupted
by
the
police
is
a
common
sight
in
the
poor
tenderloin
district
use
is
widespread
among
the
city's
many
homeless
because
the
drug
induces
aggression
frenzy
and
paranoia
passers-by
often
feel
unsafe
half
the
people
now
admitted
for
psychiatric
emergencies
to
the
city's
general
hospital
are
suffering
from
the
effects
of
meth-induced
psychosis
the
problem
is
not
confined
to
san
francisco
although
politicians
and
journalists
are
understandably
transfixed
by
the
people
killed
by
opioids
each
year
the
rise
in
meth-overdose
deaths
has
attracted
less
attention
see
chart
in
only
americans
died
of
an
overdose
by
deaths
had
increased
fold
to
people
meth
addiction
mostly
afflicts
western
and
south-western
states
like
arizona
oklahoma
and
new
mexico
where
fentanyl
and
heroin
deaths
are
less
common
than
in
the
east
for
that
reason
states
tend
to
either
have
a
meth
problem
or
an
opioid
problem
with
the
exception
of
west
virginia
which
leads
the
nation
in
overdose
deaths
for
both
much
of
this
deadly
surge
is
caused
by
supply
little
meth
is
now
made
in
america
the
number
of
domestic
meth
labs
busted
by
police
dropped
from
in
to
in
most
of
these
are
amateurish
operations
that
cops
call
beavis
and
butthead
labs
incapable
of
producing
more
than
two
ounces
of
the
stuff
per
batch
mexican
cartels
dominate
the
market
they
manufacture
meth
in
superlabs
across
the
border
says
chris
nielsen
the
special
agent
in
charge
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration's
dea
san
francisco
division
left
unmolested
the
chemists
have
perfected
their
technique
the
purity
of
mexican-produced
meth
has
surged
from
in
to
today
at
the
same
time
competition
between
cartels
has
increased
supply
quartering
prices
they're
becoming
more
brazen
now
the
loads
are
becoming
bigger
says
mr
nielsen
his
division
seized
kg
of
meth
in
more
than
the
year
before
another
reason
for
the
meth
surge
is
the
growth
of
so-called
polydrug
abuse
half
of
those
who
died
of
meth
overdoses
in
also
had
opioids
in
their
system
users
usually
have
a
drug
of
choice
opioids
which
numb
feeling
or
stimulants
such
as
cocaine
and
meth
when
they
cannot
cheaply
or
easily
obtain
their
preferred
hit
or
if
they
are
afraid
that
the
local
batch
is
tainted
they
will
often
substitute
another
drug
in
robust
urban
markets
doses
of
fentanyl-laced
heroin
or
meth
can
be
obtained
for
as
little
as
one
factor
that
had
limited
the
spread
of
meth
is
that
it
is
a
pain
to
use
injecting
it
requires
dissolving
it
in
acid
and
high
heat
which
then
damages
veins
smoking
it
harms
the
lungs
but
that
too
may
now
be
changing
as
manufacturers
are
experimenting
with
putting
the
drug
in
pill
form
a
husband
and
wife
were
recently
arrested
for
running
a
meth-pill
operation
from
their
business
a
care
home
in
vallejo
california
they
had
lb
of
pills
embossed
with
reproductions
of
american
icons
like
the
kool-aid
man
tesla
and
donald
trump
widespread
introduction
of
such
pills
would
not
just
make
the
drug
easier
to
take
it
could
also
be
sold
as
a
party
drug
to
unsuspecting
youngsters
in
san
francisco
where
the
death
rate
in
was
nearly
triple
the
national
average
rates
of
use
are
especially
high
among
gay
residents
who
take
it
as
a
party
drug
and
the
homeless
its
cheapness
has
accelerated
a
problem
that
has
existed
for
decades
among
the
lgbt
community
around
meth
use
says
raphael
mandelman
a
member
of
the
city's
board
of
supervisors
it
is
also
used
by
folks
who
are
homeless
who
are
trying
to
get
through
a
cold
night
or
stay
awake
he
says
like
opioids
meth
is
highly
addictive
and
difficult
to
quit
but
unlike
opioids
it
lacks
effective
pharmacological
treatments
there
is
no
approved
medication-assisted
treatment
for
addiction
which
substantially
decreases
the
chance
of
relapse
there
is
also
no
equivalent
of
naloxone
a
life-saving
drug
that
reverses
an
opioid
overdose
meth
kills
by
overloading
blood
vessels
eventually
resulting
in
aneurysms
heart
failure
and
strokes
as
a
result
longtime
older
users
are
likeliest
to
die
in
san
francisco
the
average
age
of
those
who
die
of
a
meth
overdose
is
all
this
makes
treatment
difficult
one
week
programme
run
by
the
san
francisco
aids
foundation
has
found
success
by
giving
gift
cards
of
small
value
to
people
as
a
reward
for
negative
drug-test
results
after
completing
the
programme
of
participants
stopped
using
meth
the
city
has
at
least
managed
to
sidestep
some
of
the
most
serious
health
consequences
of
injection
drug
use
increased
