what
do
donald
trump's
immigration
raids
accomplish
they
are
a
show
of
force
for
a
president
trying
to
keep
his
deportation
numbers
up
the
school
day
on
august
th
was
just
beginning
when
a
counsellor
pulled
year-old
jos
out
of
class
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
agents
were
raiding
seven
poultry-processing
plants
did
he
know
anyone
who
worked
at
one
of
them
he
did
jos
worked
afternoon
shifts
his
parents
worked
days
were
then
at
the
plant
and
like
him
were
undocumented
they
brought
jos
not
his
real
name
and
his
family
to
america
four
years
ago
his
thoughts
ran
to
his
four
brothers
and
sisters
if
his
parents
were
detained
and
deported
who
would
feed
and
care
for
them
how
would
they
pay
rent
jos
s
parents
ended
up
among
the
people
released
after
being
arrested
that
day
another

louisiana

mississippi
father
roberto

parish
priest
of
st
michael's
church
in
nearby

says
his
parishioners
are
frightened
mark
bowman
a
pastor
in
neighbouring
carthage
says
that
when
his
parishioners
showed
up
to
donate
boxes
of
food
to
families
of
the
detained
some
wouldn't
come
to
the
door
because
they
thought
we
might
be
ice
barack
obama's
administration
deported
large
swathes
of
undocumented
immigrants
but
his
directives
to
ice
were
to
avoid
sweeping
raids
president
donald
trump
has
revived
them
and
has
moved
to
change
the
way
detained
migrants
are
treated
on
august
st
his
administration
unveiled
plans
that
could
allow
for
the
indefinite
detention
of
undocumented
families
including
children
who
cross
the
border
illegally
the
new
rules
would
replace
a
decades-old
agreement
on
levels
of
care
for
migrant
children
and
the
length
of
time
the
government
can
detain
them
in
tom
homan
who
then
headed
ice
ordered
workplace
enforcement
to
be
increased
four
or
five
times
over
then-current
levels
the
mississippi
raids
comprised
the
seventh
workplace
raid
since
april
in
which
more
than
people
have
been
arrested
it
was
the
biggest
since
a
raid
on
a
slaughterhouse
and
meatpacker
in
postville
iowa
yielded
nearly
arrests
on
may
th
near
the
end
of
george
w.
bush's
presidency
that
raid
occurred
in
a
different
political
world
muzaffar
chishti
a
lawyer
and
policy
analyst
with
the
migration
policy
institute
a
think-tank
contends
that
the
pottsville
raid
was
intended
to
nudge
congressional
republicans
into
supporting
immigration
reform
by
showing
them
how
inhumane
enforcement
would
be
without
an
agreement
the
current
raids
says
mr
chishti
are
the
signal
of
an
anti-immigration
president
to
his
base
bryan
cox
an
ice
spokesman
insists
that
ice
is
equally
focused
on
those
who
unlawfully
seek
employment
and
the
employers
who
knowingly
hire
them
but
between
march
and
march
just
employers
were
charged
for
hiring
undocumented
workers
none
has
yet
been
charged
after
the
raids
in
mississippi
koch
foods
one
of
the
raided
processors
noted
in
a
statement
that
employers
cannot
demand
more
documents
when
employees
present
authentic-looking
papers
and
that
e-verify
an
online
system
that
is
supposed
to
confirm
employees
legality
does
not
catch
workers
using
the
stolen
or
borrowed
identity
of
a
legal
migrant
as
a
show
of
force
such
raids
are
impressive
as
a
matter
of
policy
they
are
inefficient
requiring
large
resource
expenditures
to
arrest
a
few
hundred
workers
it
may
sound
tough
to
say
that
every
undocumented
immigrant
is
an
equal
priority
but
from
a
public-safety
perspective
it
makes
no
sense
a
workplace
raid
absorbs
time
that
then
cannot
be
spent
on
more
dangerous
undocumented
immigrants
there
are
signs
that
this
shift
in
priorities
is
having
consequences
the
number
of
deported
people
convicted
of
a
crime
fell
to
its
lowest
level
in
since
the
year
before
mr
obama
became
president
that
figure
has
started
to
climb
but
remains
below
the
average
from
mr
obama's
time
in
office
nor
is
it
just
immigrants
whom
these
raids
make
nervous
poultry
is
mississippi's
biggest
agricultural
industry
but
cutting
chickens
is
a
dangerous
job
and
processors
were
already
struggling
to
find
workers
allison
crittenden
the
congressional-relations
director
at
the
american
farm
bureau
federation
an
agricultural
lobbying
group
says
her
members
worry
about
raids
causing
a
potential
disruption
to
farming
operations
so
what
do
these
raids
accomplish
for
one
thing
they
help
mr
trump
keep
his
deportation
numbers
up
now
that
local
police
are
less
co-operative
than
they
used
to
be
between
mr
bush's
inauguration
and
the
start
of
mr
obama's
second
term
deportations
rose
markedly
from
in
to
in
see
chart
much
of
that
increase
stemmed
from
local
police
assistance
metro
areas
that
offer
sanctuary
to
illegal
immigrants
as
more
than
three-quarters
of
those
housing
most
of
america's
undocumented
population
do
limit
such
co-operation
ice
agents
cannot
simply
wander
through
immigrant
neighbourhoods
at
random
demanding
proof
of
citizenship
workplaces
provide
large
numbers
of
undocumented
people
at
a
single
predictable
site
mr
trump
may
believe
that
raids
deter
would-be
migrants
but
no
evidence
backs
him
up
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
someone
whose
children
have
been
targeted
by
gangs
in
honduras
will
factor
the
prospect
of
being
caught
in
a
raid
in
mississippi
or
ohio
into
their
decision
to
flee
raids
dominate
a
couple
of
news
cycles
scare
immigrants
and
let
mr
trump
project
toughness
on
a
recent
afternoon
jos
s
neighbourhood
was
deserted
yet
if
the
administration
had
set
itself
against
jos
and
his
family
his
neighbours
had
not
pastor
bowman
says
his
parishioners
tend
to
be
politically
conservative
but
also
believe
that
god
tells
us
explicitly
to
feed
the
hungry
to
clothe
those
in
need
of
clothes
to
provide
shelter
to
those
who
are
homeless
and
to
care
for
the
immigrant
population
within
the
boundaries
of
our
country
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
