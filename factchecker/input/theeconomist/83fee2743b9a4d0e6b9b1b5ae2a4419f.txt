will
transparent
pricing
make
america's
health
care
cheaper
a
new
executive
order
requires
hospitals
and
insurers
to
disclose
their
negotiated
prices
president
donald
trump
has
been
promising
to
bring
down
health-care
costs
ever
since
he
announced
his
campaign
for
the
white
house
so
far
his
policies
have
had
the
opposite
effect
as
contenders
to
stand
against
him
in
have
begun
to
refine
their
pitches
on
health
he
has
at
last
done
something
to
keep
his
promise
on
june
th
mr
trump
signed
an
executive
order
requiring
hospitals
to
disclose
the
hitherto
secret
prices
they
have
negotiated
with
insurance
companies
the
idea
is
that
transparent
pricing
will
spur
competition
and
force
high-price
hospitals
to
cut
margins
or
become
more
efficient
the
political
urgency
is
glaring
in
a
survey
earlier
this
year
of
americans
said
they
would
prefer
a
five-year
freeze
in
their
health-care
costs
to
a
increase
in
income
one
in
eight
had
borrowed
money
to
pay
for
health
care
in
the
past
year
even
among
households
making
a
year
or
more
a
third
fear
that
a
health
crisis
could
push
them
into
bankruptcy
the
presence
of
fat
for
competition
to
trim
is
evident
from
the
wide
variation
in
negotiated
prices
where
those
have
been
made
available
for
research
analysis
of
payments
data
from
three
big
insurance
companies
found
up
to
a
fold
difference
in
the
prices
they
paid
for
a
given
service
in
the
same
metropolitan
area
even
after
outlier
prices
were
excluded
whether
making
this
kind
of
information
public
will
push
prices
down
is
doubtful
one
way
it
could
do
so
is
if
people
use
it
to
price-shop
an
estimated
of
america's
health-care
spending
goes
on
things
considered
shoppable
meaning
that
the
situation
is
not
urgent
like
a
broken
leg
or
a
heart
attack
and
there
is
a
choice
of
medical
providers
but
almost
all
this
expenditure
is
paid
by
insurers
meaning
patients
have
no
incentive
to
shift
to
lower-price
providers
some
patients
may
see
high
prices
as
a
sign
of
quality
says
lynn
quincy
of
altarum
a
health-care
consultancy
even
though
research
in
america
shows
that
the
two
are
not
linked
pressure
from
insurance
companies
is
a
more
likely
way
to
reduce
prices
knowing
what
hospitals
are
charging
their
competitors
may
spur
some
insurers
to
bargain
for
better
deals
big
employers
who
buy
health-insurance
plans
in
bulk
will
press
them
on
that
the
problem
is
that
a
recent
boom
of
consolidation
in
america's
hospital
industry
has
left
buyers
of
health
care
with
fewer
choices
according
to
a
study
in
by
the
commonwealth
fund
a
think-tank
of
metropolitan
areas
in
america
have
hospital
markets
that
federal
competition
authorities
would
call
highly
concentrated
meaning
that
there
is
very
little
competition
although
the
insurance
market
is
also
highly
consolidated
at
local
level
that
rarely
gives
insurers
the
upper
hand
in
bargaining
with
medical
providers
the
market
concentration
of
insurers
is
higher
than
that
of
providers
in
only
of
metropolitan
areas
according
to
researchers
at
the
commonwealth
fund
nonetheless
experience
with
price
transparency
suggests
that
hospitals
charging
particularly
high
prices
may
blink
first
when
there
is
a
dispute
over
bargaining
says
ms
quincy
until
new
hampshire's
most
expensive
hospital
charged
nearly
more
than
its
competitors
that
year
the
state's
biggest
insurer
used
data
made
available
by
a
price-transparency
law
to
shame
the
hospital
as
a
pricing
outlier
getting
public
support
which
forced
the
hospital
to
lower
its
prices
after
california's
public-employee
fund
set
a
reference
price
for
joint
replacements
covering
costs
only
up
to
that
amount
its
payments
per
patient
fell
considerably
mostly
because
hospitals
lowered
prices
to
the
reference
amount
rather
than
because
patients
shifted
to
lower-priced
hospitals
hospital
and
health-insurance
lobby
groups
claim
that
mr
trump's
price-transparency
plan
will
backfire
and
prices
will
rise
what
happens
eventually
may
vary
from
place
to
place
but
shedding
light
on
what
everyone
pays
might
just
infuse
some
reason
into
the
seemingly
random
pricing
of
america's
health
care
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
