the
black-white
wealth
gap
is
unchanged
after
half
a
century
how
to
go
about
narrowing
it
few
americans
remember
greenwood
a
once-prosperous
african-american
neighbourhood
in
tulsa
oklahoma
that
was
known
as
black
wall
street
in
dick
rowland
a
black
shoeshiner
was
charged
with
attempting
to
rape
a
white
lift-girl
in
a
downtown
office
building
an
incensed
white
mob
gathered
at
the
courthouse
to
lynch
him
then
proceeded
to
greenwood
for
two
days
of
rioting
looting
and
murder
city
officials
aided
and
abetted
the
violence
in
the
end
blocks
were
destroyed
black
people
were
made
homeless
and
as
many
as
were
killed
residents
reported
aeroplanes
flying
overhead
dropping
explosives
it
was
one
of
the
worst
incidents
of
racial
violence
since
the
civil
war
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
black
wealth
were
destroyed
or
stolen
no
compensation
was
awarded
to
either
the
victims
or
their
descendants
american
history
is
replete
with
horrific
episodes
that
prevented
the
accumulation
of
black
wealth
for
centuries
first
slavery
then
indentured
servitude
under
jim
crow
segregated
housing
and
schooling
seizure
of
property
and
racial
discrimination
the
result
was
that
in
two
years
before
the
passage
of
landmark
civil-rights
legislation
and
the
great
society
programme
the
average
wealth
of
white
households
was
seven
times
greater
than
that
of
black
households
yet
after
decades
of
declining
discrimination
and
the
construction
of
a
modern
welfare
state
that
ratio
remains
the
same
the
mean
of
black
household
wealth
is
for
whites
that
number
is
median
wealth
is
smaller
but
even
more
lopsided
the
typical
black
family
has
just
compared
with
the
typical
white
one
which
has
the
discrepancies
are
caused
by
low
incomes
and
by
debt
compared
with
whites
black
americans
have
higher
debt
loads
of
black
households
have
net
wealth
at
or
below
compared
with
of
whites
there
had
been
slow
improvement
over
the
decades
but
the
great
recession
of
wiped
this
out
since
blacks
were
disproportionately
harmed
by
the
subprime
mortgage
blow-up
because
of
that
home-ownership
the
conventional
wealth-building
tool
of
the
middle
class
stands
at
among
blacks
only
one
percentage
point
higher
than
it
was
in
compared
with
for
whites
determining
what
lies
behind
the
persistent
wealth
gap
is
essential
to
fixing
it
the
thinking
ascendant
on
the
left
blames
both
present-day
discrimination
and
the
long
history
of
racist
public
policies
such
as
redlining
an
official
practice
that
made
it
harder
for
blacks
to
get
mortgages
and
so
permanently
disrupted
the
transmission
of
wealth
between
generations
one
cure
for
this
state
of
affairs
is
reparations
a
one-off
cash
transfer
to
compensate
for
the
lasting
effects
of
slavery
and
discrimination
the
idea
long
popular
on
the
political
fringe
has
emerged
as
a
faultline
among
the
democratic
presidential
primary
contenders
juli
n
castro
barack
obama's
former
housing
secretary
criticised
senator
bernie
sanders
for
dismissing
the
idea
elizabeth
warren
a
massachusetts
senator
says
she
is
on
board
and
suggested
that
native
americans
should
be
part
of
the
conversation
too
but
more
ordinary
forces
could
also
be
at
play
wealth
is
at
its
core
the
accumulation
of
savings
over
time
lower
salaries
and
lower
saving
rates
thus
limit
the
opportunity
for
wealth
growth
a
recent
study
by
dionissi
aliprantis
and
daniel
carroll
research
economists
at
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland
argues
that
the
persistent
racial
gap
in
wealth
can
be
almost
entirely
accounted
for
by
the
racial
gap
in
income
according
to
the
latest
figures
from
the
median
black
household
takes
in
a
year
compared
with
for
the
typical
white
one
calculations
by
edward
wolff
an
economist
at
new
york
university
suggest
that
inheritances
can
explain
about
of
the
racial
wealth
gap
his
research
suggests
that
the
gap
would
close
only
modestly
if
blacks
inherited
wealth
to
the
same
extent
as
whites
do
if
the
cause
of
the
persistent
wealth
gap
is
really
a
long-term
income
disparity
the
policies
needed
to
rectify
it
are
different
even
as
discrimination
has
declined
and
the
country
has
instituted
affirmative
action
programmes
in
university
admissions
and
some
job
hiring
the
black-white
income
gap
remains
high
a
portion
of
this
is
due
to
present-day
discrimination
there
is
strong
evidence
that
employers
are
less
likely
to
call
back
applicants
with
black-sounding
names
for
example
but
there
have
also
been
other
structural
changes
to
black
america
that
have
led
to
this
stagnant
outcome
deindustrialisation
which
hit
blacks
living
in
cities
especially
hard
rising
incarceration
rates
and
the
decline
of
stable
two-parent
families
these
are
all
tied
up
in
a
complex
tangle
of
pathology
all
of
which
is
to
some
degree
the
legacy
of
historical
racism
but
a
lump-sum
reparations
payment
even
if
sizeable
would
not
lead
to
wealth
convergence
if
present-day
racial
income
patterns
remained
fixed
and
the
politics
of
reparations
remains
treacherous
even
race-neutral
anti-poverty
programmes
like
cash
welfare
and
food
stamps
already
attract
fierce
opposition
in
no
small
part
because
they
are
often
seen
by
white
voters
as
handouts
to
minorities
and
immigrants
reparations
would
surely
worsen
the
racial
divide
perhaps
to
donald
trump's
electoral
benefit
a
more
promising
proposal
for
narrowing
the
inheritance
gap
offered
by
darrick
hamilton
and
william
darity
two
economists
is
baby
bonds
essentially
trust
accounts
for
every
child
born
in
america
which
could
not
be
accessed
until
adulthood
the
federal
government
would
top
up
these
accounts
each
year
depositing
more
for
poorer
families
cory
booker
a
new
jersey
senator
running
for
president
has
proposed
legislation
to
do
this
the
annual
cost
would
be
bn
according
to
one
analysis
from
columbia
university
for
context
the
budget
for
the
federal
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
is
bn
universal
access
to
the
trust
accounts
might
stave
off
opposition
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
is
replicating
what
happened
in
the
new
deal
with
the
gi
bill
and
the
federal
housing
loans
that
excluded
blacks
says
mr
hamilton
he
also
likens
the
idea
to
the
birth
of
the
social
security
pensions
programme
we
as
a
society
decided
that
we
didn't
want
our
elderly
to
be
economically
insecure
so
the
government
came
up
with
a
programme
we
don't
have
anything
for
young
people
except
subsistence
programmes
to
keep
them
from
being
destitute
he
says
one
vulnerability
is
that
the
policy
has
a
built-in
lag
time
of
years
and
benefits
a
constituency
that
cannot
vote
or
hire
lobbyists
britain
introduced
a
similar
scheme
only
to
cancel
it
six
years
later
and
although
a
government-funded
inheritance
would
go
some
way
to
making
up
for
historical
injustices
it
would
not
erase
the
black-white
income
gap
china's

industry

europe's
