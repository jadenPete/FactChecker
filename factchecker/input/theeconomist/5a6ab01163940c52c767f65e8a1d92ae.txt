facebook
turns
how
the
social-networking
giant
has
changed
america
on
february
th
a
young
website
with
a
baby-blue
banner
was
born
founded
in
a
dormitory
at
harvard
thefacebook
com
tapped
into
people's
instinctive
desire
to
see
and
be
seen
few
guessed
how
successful
it
would
become
in
rupert
murdoch
the
media
mogul
who
had
bought
the
social-networking
rival
myspace
called
facebook
the
flavour
of
the
month
the
following
year
this
newspaper
warned
in
an
article
about
facebook
that
it
is
awfully
easy
for
one
next
big
thing
to
be
overtaken
by
the
next
instead
facebook
has
stayed
on
top
by
spreading
wildly
across
america
and
the
world
and
buying
competitors
including
the
photo-sharing
app
instagram
and
the
messaging
firm
whatsapp
around
two-thirds
of
american
adults
use
its
original
social
network
at
its
peak
the
average
user
spent
nearly
an
hour
a
day
on
facebook's
platforms
few
companies
have
exerted
such
a
strong
influence
on
society
changing
people's
communication
habits
reuniting
lost
contacts
shaping
their
perception
of
world
events
and
redefining
the
meaning
of
the
word
friend
every
once
in
a
while
changes
in
technology
come
along
which
are
so
profound
that
there
is
a
before
and
an
after
facebook
is
one
of
those
says
roger
mcnamee
author
of
a
forthcoming
book
called
zucked
birthdays
are
an
occasion
for
reflection
in
the
years
since
its
founding
facebook
has
altered
america
in
three
notable
ways
first
it
has
shaped
what
it
means
and
feels
like
to
be
young
the
company
has
done
this
twice
once
with
its
flagship
social
network
which
became
the
pastime
and
addiction
of
college
students
and
high
schoolers
in
the
mid-
s
and
again
with
instagram
which
is
the
digital
drug
of
choice
for
their
successors
today
along
with
the
rival
app
snapchat
the
company
has
fostered
a
virtual
me-conomy
where
people
over
share
their
feelings
photos
and
comments
some
blame
facebook
for
fanning
teenage
narcissism
and
for
short
attention
spans
others
say
it
has
caused
anxiety
depression
and
insecurity
researchers
have
shown
that
people
who
spend
more
time
on
facebook
are
more
likely
to
think
other
people
have
it
better
than
they
do
and
that
life
is
unfair
the
lasting
effects
of
social
media
and
facebook
in
particular
on
young
people's
psyches
will
not
be
fully
understood
for
years
but
it
is
clear
that
facebook
has
changed
human
interaction
at
the
safe
remove
of
a
screen
bullying
on
social
media
has
become
painfully
common
some
of
american
teenagers
say
they
have
been
bullied
or
harassed
online
facebook
has
cultivated
far-flung
online
friendships
but
it
has
changed
the
nature
of
offline
ones
too
according
to
research
by
common
sense
media
a
non-profit
in
around
half
of
to
year-olds
said
their
favourite
way
to
communicate
with
friends
was
in
person
today
only
feel
that
way
with
preferring
texting
second
facebook
has
changed
attitudes
to
privacy
the
social
network
thrives
through
trust
after
facebook
was
launched
for
the
first
time
people
felt
comfortable
sharing
intimate
details
online
including
their
phone
number
relationship
status
likes
and
dislikes
location
and
more
because
they
felt
they
could
control
who
had
access
to
them
users
were
vaguely
aware
that
facebook
was
starting
to
make
a
fortune
mining
this
data
and
selling
advertisers
access
to
specific
types
of
users
but
they
mostly
did
not
object
opinions
about
privacy
may
be
shifting
again
at
facebook's
hands
this
time
in
reverse
public
scandals
about
outside
firms
getting
access
to
facebook
users
data
including
last
year's
cambridge
analytica
fiasco
have
shone
a
light
on
the
firms
massive
data
collection
around
half
of
american
adult
users
are
not
comfortable
with
facebook
compiling
such
detailed
information
about
them
according
to
a
survey
by
pew
research
centre
concerns
about
privacy
and
lax
oversight
probably
played
into
the
beating
that
facebook's
reputation
took
last
year
according
to
the
reputation
institute
a
consultancy
facebook's
standing
among
americans
fell
sharply
in
and
its
score
ranks
significantly
below
other
technology
companies
including
google
a
fresh
scandal
over
facebook
spying
on
users
online
activities
in
the
name
of
research
may
further
dent
the
company's
image
third
facebook
has
left
a
lasting
mark
on
politics
the
social-networking
firm
has
become
an
invaluable
tool
for
politicians
seeking
office
both
through
paid
advertisements
to
reach
voters
and
free
content
that
spreads
on
the
social
network
you'd
be
hard-pressed
to
find
a
politician
who's
been
elected
in
the
last
ten
years
who
didn't
use
facebook
says
david
kirkpatrick
author
of
the
facebook
effect
a
history
of
the
social
network
two
presidents
barack
obama
and
donald
trump
won
election
in
no
small
part
thanks
to
facebook
in
mr
obama's
case
facebook
helped
him
fundraise
and
drum
up
support
in
facebook's
role
was
more
controversial
false
news
spread
wildly
and
russians
meddled
with
messages
on
social
media
which
may
have
helped
mr
trump
gain
an
edge
the
rise
of
fake
news
and
spread
of
filter
bubbles
where
people
see
their
pre-conceptions
reinforced
online
have
probably
disillusioned
many
voters
facebook
has
had
a
hand
in
spreading
misinformation
terrorism
and
ethnic
violence
around
the
world
but
it
has
also
spurred
civil
engagement
black
lives
matter
a
campaign
against
police
violence
began
with
a
facebook
post
and
quickly
spread
through
the
social
network
much
of
the
grassroots
opposition
to
mr
trump
from
the
women's
marches
to
groups
like
indivisible
use
the
platform
to
organise
themselves
many
other
campaigns
and
movements
have
attracted
members
through
facebook
and
twitter
they
give
ordinary
people
a
voice
that's
a
net
positive
for
society
says
mr
kirkpatrick
can
the
social-media
giant
stay
as
influential
in
the
next
years
as
it
has
already
been
at
the
risk
of
being
wrong
about
facebook
again
that
seems
unlikely
this
is
partly
because
its
impact
has
already
been
so
extensive
but
it
is
also
because
of
growing
unease
with
the
platform
as
with
all
new
technologies
from
the
printed
book
to
the
telegraph
social
media
can
be
used
both
for
good
and
bad
critics
of
facebook
are
increasingly
vocal
about
the
harms
pointing
out
that
facebook
is
addictive
harmful
for
democracy
and
too
powerful
in
making
decisions
about
what
content
people
see
big
tobacco
is
what
the
bosses
of
several
top
tech
companies
have
started
calling
the
social
network
and
politicians
are
speaking
openly
about
regulation
though
it
has
just
posted
record
quarterly
profits
it
seems
unlikely
that
americans
are
going
to
increase
the
time
they
spend
on
facebook
proper
time
on
its
core
social
network
is
declining
probably
because
users
are
questioning
whether
it
is
as
enjoyable
as
it
used
to
be
adults
in
america
spent
of
their
online
time
on
facebook's
main
platform
a
fifth
less
than
two
years
earlier
according
to
brian
wieser
of
pivotal
research
instagram
use
is
rising
but
not
enough
to
make
up
for
the
core
social
network's
decline
as
more
people
question
whether
social
media
are
good
for
them
facebook
could
loosen
its
grip
on
america
the
relationship
with
facebook
continues
but
the
love
affair
is
over
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
