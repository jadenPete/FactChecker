american
states
have
criminalised

maryum
saifee
was
in
a
college
anthropology
seminar
when
she
realised
she
had
been
a
victim
of
female
genital
mutilation
fgm
as
a
classmate
described
the
practice
a
flood
of
memories
came
rushing
back
she
had
been
seven
and
living
with
family
in
india
for
the
summer
while
her
parents
stayed
at
home
in
texas
her
aunt
a
doctor
led
her
to
a
downstairs
clinic
cut
her
clitoris
without
anaesthetic
and
gave
her
a
chocolate
bar
as
a
reward
it
was
by
far
the
most
traumatic
thing
i've
ever
experienced
says
ms
saifee
but
like
most
survivors
she
never
talked
about
it
she
broke
her
silence
only
recently
when
she
grew
impatient
at
how
few
americans
seemed
to
know
about
the
issue
or
that
it
affected
well-off
educated
citizens
like
herself
everyone
thinks
this
is
happening
somewhere
far
away
but
it
touches
communities
you
wouldn't
expect
the
centres
for
disease
control
and
prevention
estimates
that
women
and
girls
in
america
have
either
endured
or
are
likely
to
suffer
the
procedure
which
involves
the
medically
unnecessary
removal
of
some
or
all
of
the
external
genitalia
but
this
figure
was
cobbled
together
from
immigration
rates
and
data
collected
from
abroad
and
few
believe
it
accurately
measures
the
phenomenon
it
is
hard
to
monitor
a
secret
act
performed
mainly
in
close-knit
immigrant
communities
many
women
are
too
ashamed
to
come
forward
those
who
do
are
often
shunned
or
accused
of
stoking
islamophobia
although
congress
banned
fgm
over
years
ago
the
subterranean
nature
of
the
practice
has
made
it
hard
to
crack
down
on
offenders
this
seemed
to
change
when
prosecutors
brought
the
first
federal
fgm
case
to
trial
the
justice
department
charged
jumana
nagarwala
a
doctor
with
cutting
the
genitals
of
nine
girls
all
of
them
members
of
the
dawoodi
bohra
sect
of
indian
shia
muslims
in
a
clinic
in
michigan
but
in
november
last
year
the
judge
dismissed
the
case
ruling
that
the
federal
ban
is
unconstitutional
because
congress
lacks
authority
over
criminal
law
federal
lawmakers
had
prohibited
fgm
as
an
interstate
commerce
under
the
commerce
clause
which
struck
the
judge
as
inapt
anti-fgm
advocates
have
argued
back
pointing
out
that
parents
of
girls
in
states
where
fgm
is
illegal
specifically
travelled
to
dr
nagarwala
for
the
procedure
because
michigan
lacked
a
ban
the
government
has
declined
to
pursue
an
appeal
despite
its
failure
the
case
has
helped
to
raise
awareness
of
fgm
and
has
pushed
states
to
get
laws
on
the
books
michigan
rushed
to
ban
the
practice
after
dr
nagarwala
was
arrested
in
and
other
states
quickly
followed
suit
that
is
despite
the
fact
that
this
issue
which
pits
people
who
are
anxious
to
be
friendly
to
muslim
immigrants
against
feminists
splits
the
democratic
coalition
down
the
middle
of
the
states
that
have
criminalised
fgm
nine
either
passed
enacted
or
amended
their
laws
this
year
and
a
further
nine
states
are
considering
legislation
because
the
michigan
case
showed
that
people
are
willing
to
cross
state
lines
to
avoid
arrest
lawmakers
now
see
the
need
for
bans
in
presumed
low-risk
states
