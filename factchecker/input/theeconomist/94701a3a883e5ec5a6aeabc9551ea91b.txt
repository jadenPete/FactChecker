jared
kushner's
peace
plan
is
supposedly
imminent
at
the
moment
it
is
stirring
more
fear
than
hope
two
and
a
half
years
after
jared
kushner
began
work
on
the
deal
of
the
century
in
his
father-in-law's
phrase
the
administration's
middle
east
peace
plan
is
complete
at
a
recent
event
of
the
washington
institute
for
near
east
policy
winep
mr
kushner
exuded
confidence
as
he
answered
questions
about
his
proposals
which
are
rumoured
to
be
scheduled
for
release
next
month
while
tight-lipped
on
the
details
he
confirmed
that
they
are
designed
to
deal
with
two
overriding
concerns
israel's
need
for
security
and
the
palestinians
for
economic
development
contrary
to
speculation
that
the
plan
will
bypass
thornier
issues
including
the
core
question
of
palestinian
sovereignty
mr
kushner
described
it
as
a
comprehensive
and
in-depth
operational
document
best
of
all
in
his
telling
it
represents
a
novel
approach
after
three
decades
of
failed
peace
proposals
by
pointy-headed
experts
whom
mr
kushner
disdains
he
describes
his
plan
as
an
effort
to
change
the
paradigm
of
middle
east
peace
diplomacy
people
will
be
surprised
with
what's
in
it
his
audience
including
many
of
said
pointy-heads
responded
with
curiosity
scepticism
and
a
heroic
effort
to
remain
open-minded
no
one
outside
the
trump
family
thinks
mr
kushner
can
bring
peace
to
the
middle
east
neither
the
israelis
nor
the
palestinians
seem
ready
for
it
yet
his
pitch
deserves
a
fair
hearing
past
efforts
to
solve
the
israeli-palestinian
conflict
followed
a
similar
course
long
on
negotiating
principles
short
on
detail
he
therefore
promises
to
do
the
opposite
to
avoid
applying
labels
to
divisive
issues
such
as
the
status
of
a
palestinian
state
or
quasi-state
and
instead
lay
out
possible
compromises
and
mutual
benefits
you
can't
say
two-state
i
realised
that
means
different
things
to
different
people
he
said
let's
just
not
say
it
let's
just
work
on
the
details
of
what
this
means
fresh
thinking
is
clearly
warranted
and
the
bar
for
success
low
if
mr
kushner's
plan
provided
a
useful
reference
for
future
negotiations
it
could
be
worthwhile
yet
there
are
also
reasons
to
worry
about
the
damage
it
might
do
coming
at
an
especially
combustible
time
in
the
middle
east
including
recent
fighting
in
gaza
and
a
renewed
iranian
nuclear
threat
the
plan
is
liable
to
have
the
sorts
of
second-order
effects
previous
administrations
tried
to
game
out
but
which
mr
kushner
appears
uninterested
in
mahmoud
abbas
president
of
the
palestinian
authority
has
already
vowed
to
reject
it
in
protest
at
the
administration's
pro-israel
bias
seen
for
example
in
its
recognition
of
jerusalem
as
israel's
capital
some
fear
this
rejection
could
be
used
by
his
israeli
counterpart
binyamin
netanyahu
as
a
pretext
to
annex
areas
of
the
west
bank
as
he
has
sworn
to
do
that
would
be
a
serious
setback
for
peace
it
could
even
jeopardise
mr
abbas's
administration
winep's
director
robert
satloff
fears
it
would
also
have
negative
regional
ramifications
by
emboldening
iran
for
example
he
therefore
wants
donald
trump
to
keep
the
plan
under
wraps
such
worries
could
prove
to
be
overblown
the
administration's
rough
treatment
of
the
palestinians
is
consistent
with
mr
trump's
tactic
of
applying
maximum
pressure
in
any
negotiation
having
lowered
mr
abbas's
expectations
of
his
plan
mr
kushner
might
conceivably
intend
to
disarm
him
with
an
unexpectedly
generous
proposal
for
palestinian
statehood
his
cosiness
with
mr
netanyahu
conversely
could
allow
him
to
wring
significant
compromises
from
the
israelis
but
don't
bet
on
this
mr
kushner's
regional
diplomacy
including
his
faltering
efforts
to
get
arab
support
for
his
plan
has
not
been
ingenious
he
is
unlikely
to
turn
the
screws
on
mr
netanyahu
a
close
family
friend
and
the
vainglorious
palestinians
would
anyway
be
unlikely
to
recalibrate
their
demands
in
response
to
american
rudeness
given
how
slim
the
chances
of
success
are
it
is
tempting
to
wonder
why
the
administration
is
bothering
with
this
at
all
mr
trump
launched
mr
kushner
on
his
quest
in
the
exuberant
aftermath
of
his
election
aware
that
his
predecessor
had
failed
to
fix
the
middle
east
but
with
little
understanding
of
how
hard
that
would
be
now
mired
in
scandal
and
a
negotiation
with
china
that
is
far
more
central
to
his
presidency
he
might
consider
mr
kushner's
plan
a
fruitless
distraction
some
suspect
the
president
will
indeed
shelve
it
yet
that
may
underestimate
the
degree
to
which
the
administration's
foreign
policy
is
fuelled
by
emotion
on
trade
with
china
peace
talk
with
north
korea
and
war
talk
with
iran
its
policies
are
defined
as
much
by
a
resentful
audacious
style
as
by
their
muddled
aims
mr
kushner
by
the
same
token
appears
to
be
motivated
in
part
by
the
prospect
of
thumbing
it
to
his
doubters
with
their
dreary
talk
of
history
and
risk
his
obsession
with
the
novelty
of
his
approach
points
to
this
if
we
fail
we
don't
want
to
fail
the
way
it's
been
done
in
the
past
he
says
mr
trump's
foreign
policy
tends
also
to
reflect
whatever
the
president
considers
to
be
in
his
short-term
political
interest
his
reliance
on
evangelical
christians
who
support
israeli
expansionism
therefore
presents
an
additional
uncertainty
it
is
not
impossible
to
imagine
him
blessing
mr
netanyahu's
threatened
land
grab
as
a
means
to
please
his
base
that
danger
should
warn
mr
abbas
against
rejecting
mr
kushner's
proposals
too
precipitously
the
palestinian
leader
should
also
be
aware
that
the
chances
of
america's
next
president
reverting
to
the
traditional
middle
east
peace
template
are
not
high
with
the
rise
of
iran
and
saudi
arabia
israeli-palestinian
peace
no
longer
seems
so
important
to
the
stability
of
the
middle
east
which
given
the
rise
of
china
no
longer
seems
so
crucial
to
the
world
much
as
the
palestinians
may
lament
mr
kushner's
personal
and
mr
trump's
political
attachments
to
israel
those
ties
may
be
all
that
is
keeping
america
as
engaged
with
the
israeli-palestinian
dispute
as
it
is
however
unsatisfactory
he
may
find
the
administration's
looming
proposals
mr
abbas
should
therefore
not
count
on
receiving
better
ones
soon
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
