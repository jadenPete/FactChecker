john
kasich
conservative
orphan
ohio's
departing
governor
is
a
credit
to
his
party
and
donald
trump's
biggest
critic
you
got
minutes
growled
john
kasich
the
governor
of
ohio
had
just
chaired
his
last
cabinet
meeting
and
was
impatient
to
leave
the
office
which
he
has
occupied
for
the
past
eight
years
and
will
vacate
permanently
this
week
several
hours
later
after
an
extended
discussion
of
his
state
america
why
he
lost
in
to
donald
trump
the
damage
done
by
his
presidency
politics
on
the
right
golf
faith
and
mr
kasich's
electric
car
it's
like
driving
a
space
rocket
lexington
bade
him
farewell
at
a
party
for
his
security
detail
on
the
other
side
of
columbus
he
had
reached
it
via
the
governor's
office
car
house
and
garage
with
pauses
to
chat
with
mr
kasich's
wife
and
teenage
twin
daughters
c'mere
girls
i
brought
you
a
brit
along
the
way
the
governor
who
is
mr
trump's
biggest
republican
critic
does
not
stand
on
ceremony
he
kicks
up
a
conversational
firestorm
racing
from
topic
to
topic
showing
the
same
fervent
interest
in
a
controversial
dam
project
as
in
his
home
suburb's
connection
to
the
underground
railroad
and
the
future
of
the
west
unlike
many
politicians
he
is
also
able
to
surprise
bullish
and
irascible
he
is
most
interested
in
his
own
views
trusts
his
gut
where
the
evidence
fails
him
and
sweeps
counter-arguments
aside
ignore
the
polls
evangelical
christians
are
not
the
solid
trump
constituency
many
say
he
insists
and
i
happen
to
know
this
yet
he
periodically
backs
up
as
if
suddenly
irritated
by
his
own
certainty
forget
that
what
do
you
think
do
you
think
any
of
us
really
knows
what
we're
doing
a
more
original
politician
than
he
appeared
to
be
in
when
his
upbeat
reaganite
message
found
few
takers
mr
kasich's
governing
record
reveals
the
same
mix
of
intensity
single-mindedness
and
sporadic
eccentricity
inheriting
a
state
in
economic
crisis
including
an
bn
budget
shortfall
he
slashed
spending
privatised
services
and
accepted
protest
as
proof
of
concept
doing
the
right
thing
no
matter
the
political
cost
is
one
of
his
mantras
that
usually
means
the
conservative
thing
fairly
solidly
pro-life
and
pro-gun
mr
kasich
is
not
the
squishy
centrist
he
is
sometimes
portrayed
as
except
when
he
is
when
it
comes
to
helping
the
poor
incarcerated
and
addicted
he
has
long
argued
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
his
decision
to
expand
medicaid
despite
opposition
from
republicans
illustrated
that
since
the
election
he
has
also
been
thumbing
it
to
republican
orthodoxy
more
often
he
signed
off
on
modest
gun
and
abortion
controls
and
campaigned
on
health
care
alongside
his
democratic
counterpart
from
colorado
john
hickenlooper
ideological
fixity
on
the
right
he
says
mainly
reflects
a
lack
of
new
ideas
that's
where
my
party
fell
short
maybe
there
is
something
in
the
conservative
dna
that
makes
it
easier
to
be
against
something
than
for
it
he
believes
mr
trump's
success
was
based
on
filling
the
void
it
follows
that
he
considers
republicans
to
be
open
to
a
course
correction
now
people
are
going
to
get
serious
about
what
they
want
to
see
in
the
country
he
says
so
do
i
think
someone
like
me
could
stand
up
and
change
the
whole
debate
i
do
mr
kasich
has
suggested
he
will
run
against
mr
trump
in
ideally
as
a
republican
or
else
as
an
independent
if
there
is
enough
money
and
other
encouragement
available
to
suggest
he
can
win
as
things
stand
there
won't
be
his
rather
self-serving
explanation
of
why
he
lost
in
is
a
clue
to
that
mr
kasich
says
he
was
drowned
out
by
the
media's
obsession
with
mr
trump
but
journalists
gave
him
more
time
than
most
republicans
even
after
his
mainstream
rivals
were
eliminated
he
raised
little
money
and
only
won
his
own
state
as
mr
kasich
acknowledges
a
resentful
republican
primary
audience
was
not
in
the
mood
for
his
talk
of
bipartisan
problem-solving
but
it
also
spurned
his
ideas
it
turned
out
many
republicans
had
long
preferred
mr
trump's
talk
of
border
walls
and
protectionism
to
mr
kasich's
support
for
immigration
and
trade
the
surveys
he
disdains
suggest
they
still
do
kasich
voters
tended
to
be
republicans
hostile
to
mr
trump
and
are
those
most
likely
to
have
quit
the
party
since
his
election
mr
kasich
is
still
popular
in
ohio
but
more
with
democrats
than
republicans
after
his
previous
break
from
politics
following
an
year
spell
in
congress
he
worked
for
fox
news
and
lehman
brothers
he
is
about
as
likely
to
return
to
one
as
the
other
his
party
has
left
him
his
record
in
ohio
which
had
cents
in
its
rainy
day
fund
in
and
now
has
bn
points
to
the
cost
of
that
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
most
successful
republican
governors
tend
to
be
moderates
or
that
they
are
generally
found
in
states
such
as
massachusetts
maryland
and
texas
where
republicans
need
independent
or
democratic
voters
to
win
statewide
as
the
republican
party
becomes
increasingly
inhospitable
to
such
figures
nationally
it
is
not
obvious
how
it
can
retain
them
at
the
state
level
either
it
will
have
to
reverse
course
from
trumpian
nationalism
which
may
take
longer
perhaps
including
a
couple
of
crushing
presidential
election
defeats
than
mr
kasich
predicts
or
else
the
democrats
may
seize
the
opportunity
they
have
been
given
to
expand
their
coalition
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
mr
kasich
in
the
same
party
as
mr
hickenlooper
he
thinks
about
things
pretty
much
the
same
way
i
do
mr
kasich
says
a
third
possibility
is
that
democrats
continue
marching
to
the
left
creating
an
opportunity
for
a
third-party
candidate
to
surge
through
the
middle
it
seems
unlikely
democratic
extremism
is
often
exaggerated
and
independent
candidates
face
big
financial
and
other
barriers
mr
kasich
seems
nonetheless
most
intrigued
by
this
prospect
and
in
the
event
of
a
presidential
face-off
between
say
mr
trump
and
senator
bernie
sanders
it
would
be
wrong
to
rule
it
out
but
he
might
in
that
case
consider
a
word
of
advice
he
is
an
innovator
who
in
came
across
as
rather
a
stick-in-the-mud
to
assemble
a
new
centrist
coalition
mr
kasich
should
unleash
the
political
cross-dressing
maverick
that
he
is
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics

rags
to
