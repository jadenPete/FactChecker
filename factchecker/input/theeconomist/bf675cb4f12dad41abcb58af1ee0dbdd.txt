america
mulls
regulating
facial
recognition
the
rare
issue
that
unites
left
and
right
when
thinking
about
police
use
of
facial
recognition
most
americans
probably
fall
somewhere
between
two
extremes
on
one
side
is
the
approach
taken
by
san
francisco
and
somerville
massachusetts
both
of
which
earlier
this
year
banned
municipal
agencies
including
the
police
from
using
facial
recognition
on
the
other
is
the
view
expressed
by
michael
mccaul
a
republican
congressman
from
texas
who
during
a
hearing
of
the
house
homeland
security
committee
on
july
th
announced
when
somebody
is
in
the
public
domain
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy
imagine
a
world
in
which
cameras
equipped
with
facial
recognition
were
ubiquitous
in
mr
mccaul's
view
a
permanent
government
record
of
everywhere
everyone
goes
would
be
the
price
people
pay
for
leaving
their
homes
the
supreme
court
has
rejected
versions
of
that
view
in
united
states
v
jones
a
case
in
which
held
that
police
violated
a
suspect's
fourth
amendment
rights
by
attaching
a
gps
device
to
his
car
without
a
warrant
carpenter
v
united
states
held
that
obtaining
a
suspect's
mobile-phone
metadata
without
a
warrant
also
violated
his
privacy
rights
john
roberts
the
chief
justice
noted
that
the
court
had
long
recognised
that
individuals
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
whole
of
their
physical
movements
a
person
may
have
attenuated
expectations
of
privacy
in
public
but
tracking
everywhere
they
go
violates
them
bennie
thompson
who
chairs
the
house
homeland
security
committee
charted
a
reasonable
path
between
those
views
in
last
week's
hearing
before
the
government
deploys
facial
recognition
further
he
said
it
must
be
scrutinised
and
the
american
public
needs
to
be
given
a
chance
to
weigh
in
his
committee's
hearing
on
how
the
department
of
homeland
security
uses
facial
recognition
and
other
biometrics
had
been
scheduled
for
some
time
but
news
that
broke
on
july
th
gave
it
extra
salience
the
washington
post
reported
that
over
the
past
several
years
federal
agents
have
conducted
almost
facial-recognition
searches
using
state
and
local
databases
including
collections
of
drivers
licence
photos
without
warrants
or
licence-holders
consent
among
the
searchers
were
agents
from
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
who
appear
to
have
trawled
drivers
licence
photos
in
utah
vermont
and
washington
all
states
that
provide
licences
to
undocumented
immigrants
these
states
invited
undocumented
immigrants
to
come
forward
the
federal
government
then
used
that
trust
against
them
in
may
the
house
oversight
committee
examined
the
civil-liberties
implications
of
the
technology
the
committee
chairman
elijah
cummings
plans
to
hold
another
hearing
before
calling
for
legislation
privacy
may
yet
prove
to
be
the
rare
issue
on
which
an
otherwise
largely
divided
american
public
can
agree
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
