donald
trump
is
not
the
first
president
to
fight
subpoenas
congress's
ability
to
scrutinise
the
executive
branch
rests
on
fragile
norms
in
a
senate
committee
investigating
the
teapot
dome
bribery
scandal
issued
a
subpoena
to
mal
daugherty
a
bank
president
and
brother
of
harry
daugherty
who
would
soon
resign
as
attorney-general
when
mal
failed
to
appear
the
senate
dispatched
its
deputy
sergeant-at-arms
to
ohio
to
arrest
him
daugherty
challenged
his
arrest
arguing
that
the
senate
had
exceeded
its
authority
the
supreme
court
disagreed
not
only
can
congress
compel
testimony
essential
to
a
legislative
function
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
congressional
investigations
are
intended
to
aid
congress
in
legislating
and
it
is
not
a
valid
objection
to
such
investigation
that
it
might
disclose
wrongdoing
or
crime
by
a
public
officer
president
donald
trump
has
sued
two
banks
to
stop
them
complying
with
house
subpoenas
see
article
and
asked
a
federal
court
to
block
another
to
an
accounting
firm
used
by
the
trump
organisation
he
has
vowed
to
fight
one
subpoena
issued
to
don
mcgahn
a
former
white
house
counsel
and
has
ordered
an
official
who
oversaw
white
house
security
clearances
not
to
comply
with
another
more
subpoenas
may
soon
follow
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
wants
mr
trump's
tax
returns
which
he
has
declined
to
turn
over
to
them
the
house
judiciary
committee
may
find
william
barr
mr
trump's
attorney-general
to
be
in
contempt
of
congress
for
ignoring
a
subpoena
demanding
the
unredacted
mueller
report
as
that
example
suggests
congressional
subpoenas
are
not
all-powerful
various
presidents
have
fought
them
for
different
reasons
the
usual
levers
brought
to
bear
against
private
citizens
who
ignore
subpoenas
fines
and
imprisonment
are
harder
to
use
against
executive-branch
officials
and
congressional
oversight
says
andrew
wright
an
associate
counsel
to
barack
obama
who
is
now
a
partner
with
k
l
gates
a
law
firm
is
a
quasi-political
quasi-legal
process
that
usually
resists
quick
resolution
this
does
not
mean
that
mr
trump
who
has
said
that
we're
fighting
all
the
subpoenas
because
the
house
democrats
issuing
them
aren't
like
impartial
people
can
simply
ignore
them
merely
that
this
fight
may
have
a
political
rather
than
a
legal
resolution
congress
can
charge
people
who
ignore
subpoenas
with
contempt
which
requires
a
majority
vote
in
a
single
chamber
enforcing
that
charge
is
trickier
the
days
of
apprehension
by
the
sergeant-at-arms
followed
by
detention
are
over
that
power
has
not
been
used
since
when
a
hoover
administration
official
was
held
at
the
willard
hotel
contempt
of
congress
has
been
a
federal
crime
since
but
mr
barr
is
unlikely
to
approve
prosecuting
either
his
boss
or
anyone
who
was
following
his
boss's
orders
including
himself
that
leaves
civil
contempt
as
a
possible
legal
avenue
congress
can
ask
a
federal
court
to
compel
obedience
to
a
subpoena
this
can
take
a
while
in
october
eric
holder
barack
obama's
attorney-general
received
a
congressional
subpoena
mr
obama
tried
to
block
it
by
declaring
executive
privilege
in
june
a
court
rejected
mr
obama's
blanket
claim
of
privilege
but
not
until
january
the
current
standoff
may
finish
faster
for
two
reasons
first
many
of
the
justiciability
concerns
that
took
courts
time
to
work
through
during
the
obama
and
bush
administrations
have
been
resolved
and
second
as
stephen
vladeck
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
texas
explains
mr
trump's
statement
of
blanket
refusal
suggests
that
case-specific
objections
are
post-hoc
rationalisations
which
courts
may
be
inclined
to
swiftly
reject
but
legal
battles
still
take
some
time
to
adjudicate
that
may
annoy
democrats
but
suit
mr
trump
perfectly
his
supporters
prize
his
pugnacity
and
he
prefers
table-pounding
defiance
to
the
intricacies
of
legal
compromise
also
political
salience
fades
over
time
he
may
reckon
that
if
he
loses
in
court
the
public
will
have
moved
on
to
the
next
outrage
and
congressional
subpoenas
expire
when
the
current
congress
does
making
a
successful
play
for
time
a
victory
of
sorts
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
