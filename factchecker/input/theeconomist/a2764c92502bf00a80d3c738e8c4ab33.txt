donald
trump
launches
a
familiar-sounding
re-election
campaign
identity
politics
with
a
focus
on
guns
crime
and
immigration
is
likely
to
dominate
to
describe
the
event
president
donald
trump
held
in
orlando's
amway
centre
on
june
th
as
his
re-election
campaign
launch
does
not
do
justice
to
its
strangeness
it
would
also
be
only
narrowly
true
because
he
has
never
stopped
campaigning
since
filing
his
re-election
papers
over
two
years
ago
on
the
day
he
took
office
mr
trump
has
held
over
maga
rallies
across
the
country
revelling
in
the
adulation
of
his
devoted
fans
this
week's
event
in
the
crowded
but
not
completely
full
home
of
the
orlando
magic
basketball
team
was
merely
an
extravagant
example
as
always
mr
trump
opened
with
a
shout-out
to
the
independent
witnesses
to
his
pending
performance
the
fake
news
outside
the
arena
a
trump
supporter
would
shortly
become
the
first
of
the
new
campaign
to
be
arrested
for
attacking
a
journalist
the
president
then
launched
into
the
improbable
balancing
act
extreme
triumphalism
mingled
with
extreme
grievance
that
represents
both
his
state
of
mind
and
his
political
method
he
claimed
to
have
accomplished
more
than
any
other
president
in
his
first
two
and
a
half
years
much
of
what
he
offered
in
support
of
that
claim
was
dubious
he
exaggerated
how
much
border
wall
he
is
building
to
keep
mexicans
out
he
falsely
represented
the
size
of
the
tax
cuts
he
signed
he
repeated
his
mischaracterisation
of
tariffs
as
a
cost
on
chinese
exporters
not
american
consumers
and
so
on
he
claimed
to
have
meanwhile
been
labouring
under
circumstances
that
no
president
has
had
to
deal
with
before
the
great
and
illegal
witch-hunt
the
mueller
investigation
unearthed
a
lot
of
evidence
of
malfeasance
by
the
president
yet
far
from
being
hounded
he
has
in
fact
faced
remarkably
little
comeuppance
his
democratic
opponents
are
averse
to
taking
up
articles
of
impeachment
as
previous
opposition
politicians
might
have
done
mr
trump
did
not
thank
them
for
their
restraint
our
radical
democrat
opponents
are
driven
by
hatred
prejudice
and
rage
he
cried
they
want
to
destroy
you
and
they
want
to
destroy
our
country
to
be
pro-trump
is
to
be
a
patriot
to
oppose
him
treason
it
was
nearly
an
hour
into
his
prepared
speech
before
he
turned
to
the
economy
including
growth
of
in
the
first
quarter
rising
wages
and
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
for
half
a
century
it
may
contravene
james
carville's
maxim
but
mr
trump's
re-election
campaign
is
not
primarily
about
the
economy
that
is
partly
a
reflection
of
his
character
because
his
sense
of
grievance
swamps
his
feelings
of
triumph
but
it
is
also
tactical
the
idea
that
elections
are
decided
by
the
state
of
the
economy
rests
on
an
assumption
that
there
is
a
critical
mass
of
swing
voters
persuadable
by
either
side
and
that
mass
had
been
dwindling
for
years
owing
to
partisanship
even
before
mr
trump's
extreme
divisiveness
accelerated
its
demise
only
of
americans
approve
of
his
performance
on
the
economy
despite
its
rude
health
and
the
economy
is
easily
his
strongest
measure
his
overall
approval
rating
has
rarely
reached
the
share
of
the
popular
vote
he
won
in
it
is
now
a
couple
of
points
below
that
he
is
the
only
president
never
to
have
reached
since
gallup
began
polling
on
the
issue
these
poor
numbers
make
it
hard
to
see
mr
trump
winning
any
state
he
lost
in
to
win
again
he
must
therefore
walk
the
same
path
to
an
electoral
college
majority
he
trod
that
year
through
florida
ohio
and
a
trio
of
formerly
democratic
rustbelt
states
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
the
fact
that
all
have
lots
of
older
white
people
his
most
reliable
constituency
is
why
he
remains
competitive
despite
his
low
ratings
yet
he
has
a
major
worry
while
florida
and
ohio
are
becoming
more
republican
the
more
northerly
states
appear
to
be
reverting
to
the
democrats
and
they
are
doing
so
results
in
the
mid-terms
suggested
because
the
working-class
voters
mr
trump
recruited
from
the
left
in
are
cooling
on
him
four
years
ago
he
wooed
them
with
a
combination
of
paternalistic
economic
promises
and
white
identity
politics
only
the
second
of
these
may
now
be
available
to
him
having
failed
to
provide
universal
free
health
care
bring
back
coal-mining
and
regenerate
long-shuttered
factory
towns
among
other
unlikely
pledges
he
is
now
struggling
to
repeat
them
mr
trump's
recent
vow
to
unveil
a
new
health-care
plan
in
about
two
months
carried
a
hint
of
desperation
mr
trump
may
yet
find
a
way
to
fill
this
void
a
trade
deal
with
china
or
a
cut
in
illegal
immigration
could
help
yet
it
is
likely
that
identity
politics
in
the
form
of
fierce
rhetoric
on
guns
crime
and
immigration
will
dominate
his
campaign
mr
trump
warmed
up
for
his
appearance
in
orlando
by
vowing
to
round
up
millions
of
illegal
aliens
starting
next
week
he
also
refused
to
retract
his
demand
for
five
black
teenagers
convicted
of
assaulting
and
raping
a
jogger
in
central
park
to
be
executed
though
they
were
exonerated
by
dna
evidence
and
freed
years
ago
outside
the
amway
centre
a
white
chauvinist
crew
called
the
proud
boys
flashed
white
power
signs
at
reporters
though
these
are
early
days
in
short
it
seems
highly
probable
that
mr
trump
will
re-run
his
previous
campaign
to
hear
him
it
seems
to
be
still
he
persists
in
whipping
up
his
supporters
with
denunciations
of
hillary
clinton
lock
her
up
they
screamed
in
orlando
by
far
the
biggest
uncertainty
perhaps
the
only
one
therefore
concerns
who
the
democrats
send
out
to
face
him
in
her
stead
betting
markets
put
his
chances
of
re-election
at
which
reflects
uncertainty
about
who
the
democrats
will
pick
though
incumbency
gives
him
a
boost
absent
some
game-changing
event
mr
trump
would
struggle
against
a
strong
opponent
his
hopes
may
depend
on
the
democrats
putting
forward
another
dud
too
weak
or
compromised
to
survive
his
attacks
do
not
put
it
past
them
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
