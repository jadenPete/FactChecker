build

even
if

do
this
will

what
ails
the

tweeted
about
the
attempted

of
illegals
through
large

into

carmen
sat
in

in

quietly
sobbing
five
years

she
and
her

who
was
then

fled
from

and
her
violent
husband
it's
difficult
to
leave
your
country
she
says
you
have
your
family
and
your
friends
your
whole
life
is
rooted
there
but
when
it
comes
to
your
child's
safety
i
don't

there
is

they
crossed
guatemala
mexico
and
the

before
presenting
themselves
to
immigration
cops
in

mexico
after
being
detained
she
applied
for
asylum
and
was
released
to
await
a
hearing
she
is
still
waiting
if
america
has
a
border
crisis
it
comes
not
from
any
sort
of
invasion
in
the
year
to
september
the
authorities
caught
people
trying
to
cross
the
southern
border
fewer
than
half
as
many
as
in
but
from
people
like
carmen
and
her

fleeing

in

america
to
seek
asylum
mr
trump's
steel-bollard
fencing
even
if
it
survives
a
legal
and
political
assault
will
do
nothing
to
fix
that
problem
mr
trump
wants
to
add
miles
of
fencing
to
the
roughly
that
already
exist
along
america's
border
with
mexico
he
has
identified
four
sources
to
pay
for
it
congress
gave
bn
he
also
plans
to
take
m
from
the
treasury
department's
asset-forfeiture
funds
and
bn
from
the
defence
department's
anti-drug
fund
his
administration
argues
that
declaring
a
national
emergency
which
he
did
on
february
th
gives
him
access
to
bn
appropriated
for
military-construction
projects
not
everyone
agrees
public
citizen
an
advocacy
group
filed
suit
in
a
federal
court
hours
after
mr
trump's
declaration
on
behalf
of
an
environmental
group
as
well
as
three
landowners
in
texas
who
believe
they
will
face
an
imminent
invasion
of
their
privacy
and
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
land
during
and
after
construction
of
the
wall
they
argue
that
historically
low
immigration
numbers
mean
that
no
national
emergency
exists
at
the
southern
border
mr
trump
seemed
to
acknowledge
that
during
a
press
conference
saying
i
didn't
need
to
do
this
but
i'd
rather
do
it
much
faster
they
also
argue
that
the
statute
mr
trump
has
cited
to
let
him
use
the
bn
does
not
apply
because
the
border
wall
is
neither
a
military-construction
project
nor
essential
to
support
the
mission
of
the
armed
forces
another
suit
filed
the
next
day
in
the
same
court
by
three
environmental
groups
centres
on
the
harm
to
wildlife
and
other
far-reaching
environmental
impacts
that
building
a
wall
could
cause
the
plaintiffs
acknowledge
that
the
national
emergencies
act
of
fails
to
define
emergency
but
they
contend
common
usage
of
the
term
involves
elements
of
suddenness
and
surprise
that
require
an
urgent
response
not
only
did
mr
trump
say
he
did
not
need
to
declare
an
emergency
he
bandied
the
idea
around
for
weeks
before
the
declaration
as
a
strategy
to
circumvent
congress
if
his
budget
negotiations
failed
on
february
th
a
group
of
states
sued
mr
trump
in
a
federal
court
in
san
francisco
they
argue
that
his
declaration
evinces
a
flagrant
disregard
of
fundamental
separation
of
powers
principles
ingrained
in
the
united
states
constitution
specifically
the
appropriations
clause
in
article
i
which
states
that
the
government
can
spend
only
money
provided
by
congress
the
states
also
argue
that
their
national
guard
units
stand
to
lose
millions
in
federal
funding
when
the
administration
reallocates
it
to
the
wall
at
least
one
of
these
cases
will
probably
end
up
before
the
supreme
court
where
precedent
cuts
both
ways
on
the
one
hand
courts
typically
defer
to
the
president
on
questions
of
national
security
on
the
other

when
a
president
takes
measures
incompatible
with
the
expressed
or
implied
will
of

his
power

at
its
lowest
ebb
mr
trump
seems
to
be
in
that
territory
congressional
democrats
will
try
to
pass
a
resolution
condemning
his
money
grab
yet
even
if
courts
invalidate
mr
trump's
emergency
declaration
he
is
likely
to
have
almost

to
spend
on
a
project
of
dubious
practical
utility
christopher
wilson
of
the

centre's
mexico

believes
the
discussion
over
where
to
erect
new
fencing
would
be
a
rational
conversation
years
ago
before
we
had
miles
of
fencing
along
the
border
now
we're
talking
about
where
to
put

only
a

what
mr

wants

that
is

probably

at

just

as

political
instability
and
violence
in
central
america
pushes
people
north
but
some
are
also
drawn
by
america's
inefficient
asylum
system
which
lets
people
stay
and
work
while
their
claims
are
assessed
the
real
problem
is
structural
america's
immigration-enforcement
system
was
designed
to
cope
with
the
sort
of

that
historically
came
from

eager
to
dodge

it
is

to
today's

which
consists

of

eager
to
present
themselves
to

so
they
can
claim
asylum
sadly
ambitious
immigration
reform
has
eluded
washington
for
years
and
this
administration
is
unlikely
to
take
up
that
poisoned
chalice
see

instead
it
is
poised
to
spend
billions
on
a
project
that
will
let
mr

fulfil
a
campaign
promise
while
changing
little
along
the
border
that
money
would
be
better
spent
on
technology
at
ports
of

and
on
improving
america's
asylum
system
so
that
it
draws
fewer
people
northward
and
leaves
fewer
