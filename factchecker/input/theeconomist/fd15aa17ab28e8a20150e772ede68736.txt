the
rising
clout
of
indian-americans
there
may
well
be
an
indian-american
president
before
there
is
an
american
indian
one
pramila
jayapal
a
congresswoman
from
washington
state
sees
rapid
change
in
american
politics
five
years
ago
she
was
the
first
south
asian
elected
to
her
state
legislature
in
she
made
it
to
congress
where
she
is
now
one
of
four
indian-americans
known
collectively
as
the
samosa
caucus
in
the
house
last
month
she
became
the
first
woman
of
south-asian
descent
to
preside
over
the
chamber
across
america
she
says
more
and
more
south-asian
faces
are
running
and
winning
her
successes
cheered
her
great-aunt
in
chennai
in
southern
india
who
had
much
to
gossip
about
over
tea
with
a
close
friend
in
the
city
the
aunt
of
another
american
politician
kamala
harris
the
senator
whose
mother
migrated
to
california
from
chennai
rarely
mentions
the
indian
side
of
her
family
while
campaigning
but
as
a
front-runner
in
the
race
for
the
democratic
nomination
she
is
undoubtedly
spurring
others
of
indian
descent
to
turn
to
politics
the
prominence
of
nikki
haley
a
republican
former
governor
of
punjabi
descent
who
served
until
last
year
as
america's
ambassador
to
the
un
also
fuels
interest
ram
villivalam
a
state
senator
in
illinois
says
having
a
half-indian
senator
running
to
be
president
gives
a
jolt
of
confidence
to
indian-americans
ms
jayapal
concurs
indian-americans
number
m
about
of
the
total
population
counting
both
migrants
and
their
children
most
have
arrived
in
america
over
the
past
two
decades
many
are
highly
educated
wealthy
and
in
professions
such
as
engineering
or
medicine
but
whereas
older
indian-americans
focused
on
becoming
model
citizens
and
making
money
ms
jayapal
says
that
those
below
are
much
more
engaged
and
take
democracy
and
voting
to
be
critical
raja
krishnamoorthi
an
illinois
congressman
of
tamil
descent
says
older
migrants
shunned
politics
worried
that
names
crammed
with
many
letters
would
seem
too
strange
to
voters
the
young
are
more
assured
and
politically
sophisticated
he
too
is
thrilled
by
ms
harris's
campaign
saying
she
puts
a
little
curry
into
the
narrative
of
the
presidential
race
a
decade
ago
few
south
asians
ran
for
office
of
any
sort
in
immigrant-heavy
suburbs
around
chicago
he
says
but
since
his
election
to
congress
in
he
estimates
that
or
so
candidates
have
sought
elected
office
of
some
sort
in
the
area
could
indian-americans
really
grow
into
a
significant
political
force
their
numbers
look
too
puny
to
matter
as
a
national
voting
bloc
devesh
kapur
at
johns
hopkins
university
estimates
that
only
m
voters
of
indian
descent
are
politically
active
that
number
could
double
within
two
decades
through
immigration
more
naturalisations
and
as
children
age
but
even
then
few
will
be
swing-voters
in
close-fought
states
unlike
say
cuban-americans
in
florida
most
are
reliably
democrats
of
indian-americans
backed
hillary
clinton
in
for
example
who
cluster
in
partisan
strongholds
such
as
california
new
york
and
illinois
yet
there
are
other
ways
to
amass
political
clout
mr
krishnamoorthi
and
mr
villivalam
both
suggest
indian-americans
look
to
jewish
americans
as
a
model
since
they
are
seen
as
active
in
charitable
and
civic
life
and
as
educated
organised
and
influential
in
politics
mr
kapur
who
wrote
a
book
about
the
indian
diaspora
in
america
also
calls
them
a
weak
equivalent
of
the
jewish-american
community
he
notes
that
capitol
hill
for
example
is
crammed
with
staff
and
interns
of
indian-american
heritage
they
also
appear
to
be
over-represented
in
academia
the
media
and
other
influential
posts
he
talks
of
the
growing
significance
of
informal
networks
as
well-connected
indian-americans
find
jobs
for
each
other's
offspring
ms
jayapal
also
points
to
the
prevalence
of
skilled
indian-americans
perhaps
subsidised
in
their
first
jobs
by
well-off
parents
who
work
as
assistants
to
senators
and
representatives
in
washington
karthick
ramakrishnan
who
runs
a
survey
of
asian-american
attitudes
from
the
university
of
california
argues
that
indian-americans
are
exceptional
when
compared
with
other
asian
groups
they
are
far
likelier
to
get
involved
in
politics
as
donors
voters
or
candidates
high
levels
of
education
english-language
proficiency
and
roots
in
a
country
with
its
own
long
democratic
tradition
all
help
them
to
take
part
in
america's
political
culture
money
is
also
a
factor
average
incomes
are
among
the
highest
of
any
minority
group
although
ms
jayapal
gently
grumbles
that
older
indian-americans
the
wealthiest
of
all
want
a
photo
with
a
politician
but
find
parting
with
cash
difficult
younger
ones
grasp
that
they
can
be
influential
as
donors
niraj
antani
a
young
republican
member
of
ohio's
state
legislature
who
is
of
gujarati
descent
says
indian-americans
are
responsible
for
a
portion
of
his
fundraising
and
sees
them
as
increasingly
skilled
in
bundling
donations
they
are
now
hosting
fundraising
events
not
just
attending
them
he
says
they
are
also
getting
better
organised
mr
antani
points
to
lobbies
such
as
aahoa
a
hotel
association
and
a
political
action
committee
pac
belonging
to
the
hindu-american
foundation
as
being
influential
among
indian-americans
more
significant
still
is
the
indian
american
impact
fund
a
democratic-leaning
pac
which
describes
its
mission
as
to
wield
political
power
to
fight
back
against
xenophobia
and
anti-immigrant
policies
under
president
donald
trump
indian-americans
have
a
drive
for
success
says
mr
antani
and
political
success
is
very
measurable
how
many
cabinet
secretaries
congressmen
school-board
members
and
state
legislators
do
we
have
he
and
his
colleagues
are
gung-ho
about
their
prospects
america
will
see
an
indian-american
president
before
too
long
he
predicts
it
might
even
be
the
next
one
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
