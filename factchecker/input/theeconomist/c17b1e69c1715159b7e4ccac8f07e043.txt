congress
is
winning
the
legal
battle
against
the
white
house
congress
is
likely
to
get
hold
of
information
on
the
president's
businesses
the
barricades
are
up
at
the
white
house
where
president
donald
trump
has
vowed
to
fight
all
the
subpoenas
flying
from
democrats
in
the
house
of
representatives
early
engagements
have
not
gone
well
for
mr
trump
this
week
he
lost
two
crucial
skirmishes
on
may
th
a
judge
in
washington
rejected
mr
trump's
request
to
block
a
subpoena
instructing
mazars
usa
his
accounting
firm
to
hand
over
financial
records
stretching
back
to
two
days
later
a
judge
in
new
york
thwarted
an
attempt
by
mr
trump
three
of
his
children
and
the
trump
organisation
to
stop
deutsche
bank
and
capital
one
from
delivering
banking
records
to
two
house
committees
in
the
first
case
a
committee
demanded
records
after
michael
cohen
mr
trump's
longtime
lawyer
testified
in
february
that
his
former
boss
altered
the
estimated
value
of
his
assets
and
liabilities
to
suit
his
needs
these
allegations
legislators
said
may
point
to
conflicts
of
interest
that
impair
his
ability
to
make
impartial
policy
decisions
they
could
also
provide
evidence
that
mr
trump
has
profited
from
his
office
in
violation
of
the
constitution's
foreign-emoluments
clause
the
president
assured
reporters
that
the
ruling
was
crazy
and
totally
the
wrong
decision
by
obviously
an
obama-appointed
judge
judge
amit
mehta
was
indeed
appointed
by
mr
trump's
predecessor
but
his
page
ruling
is
a
straightforward
application
of
a
year-old
supreme
court
precedent
recognising
that
congress's
power
to
secure
needed
information
is
an
attribute
of
the
power
to
legislate
it
is
not
fathomable
mr
mehta
wrote
that
the
constitution
would
grant
congress
the
power
to
remove
a
president
for
reasons
including
criminal
behaviour
but
deny
it
the
power
to
investigate
him
for
unlawful
conduct
both
mr
mehta
and
judge
edgardo
ramos
who
said
the
deutsche
bank
suit
did
not
raise
any
serious
questions
refused
to
put
their
rulings
on
hold
while
mr
trump
appeals
the
cases
could
eventually
go
to
the
supreme
court
where
mr
trump
has
installed
two
justices
but
laurence
tribe
a
scholar
of
constitutional
law
at
harvard
university
cannot
imagine
the
president
prevailing
there
and
if
the
president
defies
a
court
order
the
constitutional
crisis
that
some
americans
have
predicted
since
will
arrive
at
last
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a

hike

the
health
of
japan's
economy
