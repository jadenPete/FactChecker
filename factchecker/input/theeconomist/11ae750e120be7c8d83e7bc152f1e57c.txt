maine's
best-known
industry
is
being
pinched
blame
tariffs
and
the
endangered
right
whale
chris
welch
has
been
experimenting
for
months
restrictive
fishing
quotas
designed
to
protect
herring
the
preferred
bait
for
lobster
have
pushed
him
and
other
maine
lobstermen
to
various
expediencies
less
herring
different
bait
different
bait
bags
nothing
is
working
well
so
far
some
lobstermen
are
stockpiling
herring
expecting
prices
to
rise
during
the
summer
last
year
maine's
lobstermen
hauled
in
tonnes
of
the
critters
one
of
the
highest
landings
in
the
state's
history
so
important
is
it
to
maine's
economy
and
self-image
that
the
state
offers
a
licence
plate
depicting
the
crustacean
demand
remains
strong
says
john
sackton
an
analyst
and
publisher
of
seafood
news
lobster
is
not
just
for
posh
restaurants
and
new
england
lobster
shacks
any
more
mcdonald's
a
fast-food
chain
offers
lobster
rolls
but
this
season
has
been
stormy
the
bait
shortage
is
only
one
problem
in
the
european
union
lifted
the
tariff
on
canadian
lobster
while
keeping
it
for
the
american
kind
last
year
china
imposed
tariffs
on
american
goods
including
lobster
we
lost
of
our
business
in
mainline
china
and
saw
of
eu
sales
erode
says
tom
adams
of
maine
coast
one
of
the
largest
live-lobster
shippers
maine's
lobstermen
will
soon
have
to
rethink
how
they
catch
lobsters
for
more
than
years
they
have
used
baited
traps
also
known
as
pots
to
snare
lobsters
crawling
on
the
ocean
floor
lines
connect
the
traps
to
buoys
on
the
water
surface
scientists
say
that
these
lines
have
trapped
and
killed
some
north
atlantic
right
whales
an
endangered
species
maine
must
cut
the
number
of
lines
by
to
adhere
to
new
federal
regulations
designed
to
save
the
whales
how
this
will
be
achieved
has
yet
to
be
determined
one
possibility
is
to
insist
that
many
traps
are
attached
to
a
single
line
to
the
surface
something
that
is
easier
for
big
boats
to
handle
ropeless
options
are
expensive
and
time-consuming
a
collapsible
buoy
that
could
inflate
itself
using
compressed
air
might
work
better
lobstermen
have
a
history
of
conservation
and
self-regulation
in
they
stopped
catching
egg-bearing
females
kristan
porter
a
lobsterman
is
sympathetic
to
the
plight
of
the
right
whales
of
which
there
are
only
but
i've
never
even
seen
one
patrice
mccarron
founder
of
the
maine
lobstermen's
association
an
advocacy
group
has
not
witnessed
such
a
tumultuous
year
in
her
years
in
the
industry
as
for
mr
welch
whose
grandfather
was
a
lobsterman
and
who
has
been
fishing
since
he
was
he
is
not
sure
that
the
industry
as
he
knows
it
will
exist
for
his
son
that
is
often
the
fisherman's
lament
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
