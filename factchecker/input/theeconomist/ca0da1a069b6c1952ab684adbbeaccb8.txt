counting
america
in
the
supreme
court
seems
inclined
to
let
the
trump
administration
add
a
question
on
citizenship
to
the
census
last
june
when
his
vote
clinched
a
majority
blessing
president
donald
trump's
entry
ban
on
travellers
from
several
muslim
countries
justice
anthony
kennedy
subtly
wagged
his
finger
in
the
president's
direction
even
when
the
judiciary
grants
executive
officials
substantial
deference
justice
kennedy
wrote
it
is
an
urgent
necessity
that
they
respect
constitutional
guarantees
and
mandates
a
year
later
with
another
controversial
trump
administration
policy
blocked
by
a
trio
of
federal
district
courts
the
supreme
court
again
appears
poised
to
hand
the
executive
branch
a
victory
but
with
justice
brett
kavanaugh
in
justice
kennedy's
chair
the
conservative
majority
is
more
resolute
mr
trump
will
probably
score
a
party-line
win
the
case
department
of
commerce
v
new
york
asks
whether
wilbur
ross
the
commerce
secretary
lawfully
added
a
question
about
citizenship
to
the
census
despite
evidence
that
the
move
would
scare
off
millions
of
people
from
completing
the
form
the
constitution
requires
a
count
of
the
whole
number
of
persons
in
each
state
every
ten
years
the
census
dictates
how
the
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
are
allocated
and
thus
how
many
electoral-college
votes
should
go
to
each
state
hundreds
of
billions
of
federal
dollars
are
divided
up
according
to
state
population
too
areas
where
people
are
undercounted
will
suffer
until
at
least
soon
after
taking
office
in
february
mr
ross
sat
down
with
steve
bannon
mr
trump's
erstwhile
adviser
known
for
his
hard
line
against
immigration
to
discuss
adding
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
before
announcing
the
decision
the
commerce
secretary
undertook
a
belated
quest
to
find
a
legal
justification
for
doing
so
at
the
oral
argument
justice
elena
kagan
told
the
solicitor
general
noel
francisco
you
can't
really
read
this
record
without
sensing
that
the
need
for
a
citizenship
query
was
contrived
only
after
floating
the
concept
with
the
department
of
justice
doj
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
phoning
the
attorney-general
justice
kagan
recounted
did
the
attorney-general
come
through
with
a
letter
saying
the
question
was
needed
to
enforce
the
voting
rights
act
of
the
request
contradicted
the
view
of
experts
from
the
census
bureau
and
six
of
its
former
directors
who
served
under
both
democratic
and
republican
administrations
mr
ross's
stated
justification
for
querying
citizenship
the
lower
courts
found
was
just
a
pretext
the
rulings
did
not
mention
that
in
recent
years
conservatives
have
not
exactly
demonstrated
a
desire
to
maximise
turnout
from
ethnic
minorities
at
election
time
judge
jesse
furman
pointed
to
evidence
that
the
question
would
result
in
less
accurate
and
less
complete
citizenship
data
than
other
surveys
while
dampening
response
rates
disproportionately
in
immigrant
and
hispanic
households
together
with
similar
rulings
in
california
and
maryland
judge
furman
in
new
york
found
a
veritable
smorgasbord
of
procedural
irregularities
surrounding
the
addition
of
the
citizenship
question
given
those
deficiencies
he
found
mr
ross's
move
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
violation
of
administrative
law
at
the
hearing
the
five
republican-appointed
justices
including
mr
trump's
two
sounded
untroubled
by
mr
ross's
rationale
for
amending
the
census
form
justice
neil
gorsuch
noted
that
virtually
every
english-speaking
country
and
a
great
many
others
besides
ask
this
question
in
their
censuses
justice
kavanaugh
added
that
the
united
nations
recommends
asking
about
citizenship
the
census
asked
the
question
from
the
early
th
century
until
and
a
portion
of
households
were
asked
the
question
until
justices
samuel
alito
and
gorsuch
teamed
up
to
speculate
about
other
reasons
immigrants
might
not
fill
out
the
questionnaire
maybe
socioeconomic
status
education
or
language
ability
contribute
to
the
differential
response
rates
between
citizens
and
non-citizens
justice
alito
mused
mr
francisco
gratefully
received
this
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
tersely
parried
the
liberal
justices
arguments
it
really
does
boil
down
mr
francisco
said
to
whether
the
secretary's
judgment
here
is
a
reasonable
one
and
in
weighing
whether
to
sacrifice
a
decline
in
response
rates
for
more
citizenship
data
mr
ross
reasonably
chose
to
go
with
the
bird
in
the
hand
the
oral
argument
suggests
the
five
conservatives
have
a
clear
if
fraught
path
to
approving
the
question
the
justices
can
simply
defer
to
the
official
brushing
aside
evidence
about
his
motives
diplomacy

the
crossfire
