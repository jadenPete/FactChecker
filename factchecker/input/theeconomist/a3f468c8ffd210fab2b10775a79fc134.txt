what
it's
like
to
spend
half
a
life
in
solitary
confinement
tony
medina
has
spent
two
decades
in
a
concrete
box
in
texas
alone
tony
medina
is
a
polite
burly
man
with
heavily
tattooed
arms
like
all
those
confined
at
the
allan
b.
polunsky
unit
he
is
dressed
in
white
the
prison's
squat
grey
buildings
hold
death-row
convicts
locked
into
a
tiny
booth
in
a
visiting
room
handcuffs
off
he
compares
being
out
here
to
a
vacation
it
is
quiet
save
clangs
of
metal
doors
the
room
is
also
cooled
and
a
rarity
he
can
see
through
plexiglas
to
the
face
of
another
human
he
was
convicted
in
aged
for
a
drive-by
shooting
that
killed
two
children
at
a
new-year
party
since
then
for
years
he
has
been
awaiting
execution
in
texas
the
death
penalty
is
applied
to
those
found
guilty
of
a
heinous
crime
who
are
also
judged
to
be
a
threat
to
others
mr
medina's
legal
appeals
are
continuing
a
deafening
wall
of
noise
was
my
clearest
first
memory
of
death
row
he
says
it's
gates
slamming
the
steel
on
steel
prisons
are
all
concrete
and
steel
so
it
echoes
echoes
echoes
it
never
stops
on
his
first
night
he
was
placed
in
a
darkened
wing
full
of
shouting
inmates
a
dumbfounding
experience
like
thunderdome-type
noise
yelling
and
screaming
and
banging
and
everything
multiplied
at
first
he
shared
a
cell
then
after
other
prisoners
tried
an
escape
in
all
death-row
inmates
were
shifted
to
solitary
he
complains
that
this
is
agony
i
wasn't
sentenced
to
solitary
confinement
i
was
sentenced
to
death
every
day
since
for
years
he
has
been
alone
for
hours
inside
a
concrete
box
measuring
feet
by
feet
guards
pass
trays
of
food
through
a
slat
in
a
door
standing
on
his
bed
he
can
peer
from
a
vent-window
a
few
inches
high
near
the
ceiling
some
guys
spend
all
day
long
doing
so
he
says
he
never
does
shunning
what
is
out
there
that
i
can't
touch
he
gets
an
hour
in
an
enclosed
yard
most
days
for
recreation
again
he
is
alone
in
his
cell
he
reads
at
the
moment
a
series
about
survivalists
writes
or
sometimes
paints
relations
and
volunteers
mostly
european
women
visit
and
send
messages
inmates
shout
to
each
other
cell-to-cell
but
texas
unlike
some
states
denies
solitary
prisoners
any
physical
contact
other
than
frequent
body
inspections
by
guards
he
says
he
last
touched
a
relative
hugging
his
mother
on
august
st
other
states
with
the
death
penalty
and
federal
prisons
have
less
strict
conditions
in
many
young
inmates
and
those
with
mental-health
problems
are
no
longer
isolated
for
long
even
texas
with
more
prisoners
in
solitary
than
any
other
state
about
as
of
is
reducing
its
numbers
a
report
in
by
the
liman
centre
at
yale
estimated
that
inmates
were
kept
isolated
in
america
including
who
had
endured
six
years
or
more
that
tally
is
probably
lower
today
mr
medina
believes
texas
goes
on
isolating
its
death-row
prisoners
out
of
vindictiveness
not
because
of
security
he
calls
the
practice
outright
torture
cruel
and
inhumane
a
means
of
intimidation
to
break
a
person
mentally
before
his
execution
on
average
a
death-row
prisoner
in
texas
waits
nearly
years
before
being
put
to
death
the
longest
wait
was
years
it
is
hard
to
dispute
his
claims
dennis
longmire
of
sam
houston
state
university
in
nearby
huntsville
says
prolonged
use
of
solitary
cells
is
costly
and
needless
the
un
and
advocacy
groups
routinely
condemn
the
practice
he
has
testified
at
trials
that
older
inmates
are
not
especially
violent
to
others
he
recalls
that
his
own
visits
to
death
row
were
deafening
and
unpleasant
unsurprisingly
many
guards
demand
to
work
elsewhere
many
inmates
suffer
mental
deterioration
and
some
turn
to
suicide
says
mr
medina
whose
once
solid
immediate
neighbour
broke
after
years
prisoners
grow
anxious
from
isolation
and
sensory
deprivation
and
obsessed
by
what
they
see
as
official
petty
malevolence
inmates
in
polunsky
were
refused
permission
to
buy
nail-clippers
for
years
nor
are
they
supposed
to
decorate
their
cell
walls
some
crack
while
waiting
for
execution
when
close
friends
are
taken
away
sometimes
noisily
resisting
for
lethal
injections
there
is
added
turmoil
he
counts
executions
in
texas
since
he
arrived
on
death
row
including
guys
that
i've
considered
brothers
it
is
especially
distressing
he
says
hearing
guards
chat
and
joke
as
condemned
men
are
removed
for
execution
many
inmates
arrive
with
mental
difficulties
one
death-row
inmate
in
polunsky
andre
thomas
gouged
out
his
own
eyes
and
ate
one
in
conversation
mr
medina
is
articulate
and
measured
but
he
says
isolated
confinement
takes
a
toll
he
experiences
intense
rage
which
he
calls
beneficial
towards
the
system
the
way
i
hold
onto
my
sanity
is
by
reminding
myself
to
be
angry
at
the
people
that
put
me
here
the
anger
helped
him
build
a
lot
of
walls
very
high
in
my
mind
but
it's
not
very
healthy
for
it
can
eat
at
you
he
has
heard
of
inmates
in
texas
released
from
solitary
unable
to
cope
among
other
people
his
response
echoes
the
words
of
albert
woodfox
a
prisoner
kept
in
solitary
confinement
in
louisiana
for
years
before
being
released
in
aged
mr
woodfox
recently
published
a
book
solitary
in
which
he
writes
that
the
fight
for
sanity
never
goes
away
and
says
he
shut
my
emotional
system
down
to
cope
with
being
locked
away
alone
at
issue
is
not
whether
to
punish
the
guilty
though
mr
woodfox
did
eventually
prove
he
was
wrongfully
convicted
it
is
whether
america
should
treat
even
its
worst
offenders
like
this
i
feel
like
we're
seen
in
the
same
light
as
places
like
china
saudi
arabia
and
iran
that's
the
company
we
keep
says
mr
medina
human
beings
are
not
meant
to
be
isolated
in
this
way
correction
june
th
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
stated
that
inmates
in
america
had
endured
six
months
or
more
of
isolation
this
has
been
corrected
to
six
years
sorry
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
