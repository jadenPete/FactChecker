bernie
sanders's
permanent
revolution
the
obdurate
socialist
from
vermont
probably
cannot
win
the
democratic
ticket
but
he
could
hand
it
to
a
moderate
and
the
election
to
donald
trump
the
bernie
barnstorm
held
in
fort
collins
home
of
colorado
state
university
started
a
few
minutes
late
i
know
bernie
time
right
joshed
an
organiser
sent
from
washington
dc
to
the
crowd
of
who
had
turned
up
to
volunteer
for
bernie
sanders's
nascent
campaign
in
the
state
some
were
signed
up
to
host
a
phone
bank
which
involves
using
a
digital
system
known
as
the
bernie
dialler
others
pledged
to
canvass
and
to
put
the
results
into
a
database
called
the
bern
app
meanwhile
the
assembled
sandernistas
were
invited
to
come
to
the
mic
and
say
why
they
were
so
excited
about
bernie
with
a
little
steer
from
another
campaign
staffer
you
have
the
same
feeling
in
your
heart
that
i
have
and
you
are
dedicated
and
loyal
the
declarations
this
elicited
said
a
lot
about
the
senator
from
vermont's
effect
on
his
followers
several
described
mr
sanders
as
a
sort
of
benevolent
guru
bernie
is
a
humanist
and
a
visionary
and
a
radical
said
one
i'm
for
bernie
because
he's
for
me
said
another
all
considered
mr
sanders
to
be
more
authentic
than
other
politicians
donald
trump
pretends
to
be
a
populist
bernie's
the
real
thing
said
a
year-old
transgender
sanders
fan
many
stressed
their
suspicion
of
his
rivals
i'm
doing
my
best
not
to
dog
on
other
candidates
but
that
kamala
harris
health-care
plan
said
joe
salazar
a
failed
though
sanders-endorsed
candidate
for
colorado's
attorney-general
by
contrast
bernie's
plan's
been
refined
through
fire
he
claimed
he's
been
working
on
it
getting
all
the
numbers
down
for
years
not
since
eugene
mccarthy
in
have
democrats
faced
such
an
anomaly
after
the
unexpected
success
of
his
presidential
run
mr
sanders
has
developed
an
almost
cult-like
hold
on
a
small
but
meaningful
minority
of
the
democratic
electorate
by
tapping
it
for
cash
he
appears
also
to
have
a
durable
campaign
he
is
among
the
first
candidates
on
the
ground
in
colorado
a
state
he
won
easily
in
and
last
month
had
nearly
m
in
hand
even
if
he
looked
unable
to
win
the
nomination
he
would
be
able
to
stay
in
the
contest
and
having
pointedly
refused
to
commit
to
supporting
the
winning
candidate
he
might
well
do
so
that
could
matter
a
great
deal
because
the
chances
are
mr
sanders
cannot
win
the
of
the
vote
he
won
in
which
makes
that
contest
seem
closer
than
it
was
is
a
distant
memory
having
performed
strongly
in
early
polling
this
year
he
has
slid
as
elizabeth
warren
has
risen
the
senator
from
massachusetts
is
not
as
left-wing
as
mr
sanders
she
presents
herself
as
a
disappointed
capitalist
not
a
socialist
which
is
a
more
digestible
position
on
the
democratic
left
contrary
to
what
mr
salazar
thinks
she
also
has
a
much
firmer
grip
on
policy
above
all
she
is
a
democrat
not
an
aggrieved
independent
as
mr
sanders
is
who
would
support
any
of
her
rivals
if
she
lost
the
two
left-wingers
are
each
polling
at
around
of
the
vote
a
strikingly
poor
result
for
mr
sanders's
superior
resources
and
name
recognition
earlier
in
the
campaign
it
seemed
possible
that
he
could
emulate
mr
trump
by
sneaking
through
a
crowded
contest
with
a
loyal
minority
his
minority
now
looks
too
small
this
raises
a
fundamental
question
about
what
mr
sanders's
rise
and
fall
says
about
the
left
and
several
tactical
ones
starting
with
the
first
mr
sanders's
erstwhile
success
appears
to
have
owed
less
to
his
left-wing
proposals
than
a
vaguer
appetite
for
disruption
the
fact
that
of
his
supporters
in
voted
for
mr
trump
illustrates
that
those
who
care
mostly
about
health
care
or
education
policy
appear
since
to
have
shifted
to
ms
warren
the
remaining
diehards
seem
more
energised
by
anti-establishment
grievance
an
iranian-american
sanders
fan
in
fort
collins
drew
an
approving
cheer
for
hailing
his
hero
as
the
mossadegh
of
america
only
at
a
sanders
rally
could
an
iranian
nationalist
overthrown
by
a
cia-inspired
plot
count
as
a
point
of
reference
most
of
the
volunteers
said
they
expected
the
democratic
party
to
rig
the
election
against
mr
sanders
many
said
they
would
not
support
any
other
winning
candidate
democratic
politicians
still
believe
mr
sanders's
insurgency
showed
the
party
had
moved
in
a
big
way
to
the
left
hence
the
alacrity
with
which
many
of
his
rivals
have
aped
his
free-college-style
proposals
but
the
burn-it-down
iconoclasm
of
his
base
does
not
seem
so
consistent
or
easily
mollified
as
that
would
imply
elizabeth
warren
can
kiss
my
ass
said
rose
a
socialist
office
clerk
joe
biden
is
a
moderate
republican
they've
totally
infiltrated
the
democrats
said
remy
a
democratic-socialist
acupuncturist
who
offered
free
treatments
to
any
volunteer
who
showed
up
to
her
phone
bank
in
terms
of
tactics
mr
sanders
is
most
pressingly
a
problem
for
ms
warren
after
flirting
with
more
moderate
positions
notably
on
health
care
she
has
essentially
adopted
a
more
informed
and
nuanced
version
of
mr
sanders's
policies
in
other
words
she
is
going
after
his
supporters
yet
if
mr
sanders
stayed
in
the
race
come
what
may
dividing
the
democratic
left
that
could
prove
to
be
a
fatal
mistake
it
might
well
hand
the
ticket
to
a
moderate
most
probably
mr
biden
still
the
front-runner
thereafter
an
unreconciled
mr
sanders
would
become
a
general-election
problem
for
democrats
his
aggrieved
minority
is
easily
sufficient
to
deny
their
candidate
victory
in
close-fought
states
such
as
michigan
or
wisconsin
thus
did
mccarthy
help
ensure
hubert
humphrey's
defeat
by
richard
nixon
in
and
mr
sanders
help
ensure
hillary
clinton's
to
donald
trump
almost
all
the
sandernistas
in
fort
collins
who
admitted
to
having
voted
for
mrs
clinton
said
they
were
embarrassed
to
have
done
so
and
it
must
be
said
the
blithe
status
quo-ism
of
mr
biden
could
be
even
more
off-putting
to
mr
sanders's
supporters
than
her
wonkish
pragmatism
victory
for
mr
biden
then
for
mr
trump
that
would
be
a
poor
return
on
mr
sanders's
promise
of
political
revolution
yet
it
is
far
more
imaginable
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
