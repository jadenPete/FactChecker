the
kochtopus's
garden
plutocracy
is
a
feature
of
american
democracy
not
a
bug
few
industrialists
have
been
as
cruelly
self-serving
as
andrew
carnegie
fatal
accidents
at
his
steel
mills
accounted
for
a
fifth
of
all
male
deaths
in
pittsburgh
in
the
s
most
of
his
surviving
employees
ground
down
by
hour
shifts
seven
days
a
week
were
discarded
by
the
age
of
carnegie
did
not
much
mind
such
human
wastage
influenced
by
an
extreme
version
of
darwinism
he
considered
the
winnowing
of
the
feeble
and
thriving
of
the
ablest
in
this
case
himself
to
be
progress
yet
he
was
also
a
great
philanthropist
responsible
for
endowing
thousands
of
charities
libraries
and
in
a
sense
your
columnist
a
carnegie
scholarship
to
medical
school
was
the
lifeline
that
enabled
one
of
his
grandfathers
to
escape
his
glasgow
tenement
and
get
on
david
koch
who
died
last
week
presents
a
similar
study
in
contrasts
on
the
one
hand
the
richest
resident
of
manhattan
and
more
visible
of
the
fraternal
owners
of
koch
industries
did
a
lot
of
good
he
donated
a
fraction
of
his
bn
fortune
to
hospitals
and
universities
especially
for
research
into
cancer
the
disease
that
killed
him
at
and
the
arts
in
recent
years
he
and
his
elder
brother
charles
the
mastermind
behind
the
wichita-based
energy
and
chemicals
behemoth
also
splurged
on
campaigns
to
help
poor
migrants
and
for
criminal-justice
reform
yet
they
are
better-known
for
their
more
divisive
political
activism
as
the
vice-presidential
candidate
for
the
libertarians
in
mr
koch's
ticket
attracted
only
of
the
vote
yet
the
brothers
lobbying
against
regulation
unions
and
entitlements
in
almost
any
circumstance
a
position
so
extreme
that
william
f.
buckley
derided
it
as
anarcho-totalitarianism
helped
push
the
republican
party
much
further
to
the
right
than
most
of
its
supporters
knew
or
wanted
to
go
and
on
climate
change
in
particular
this
effort
was
underhand
while
acknowledging
the
reality
of
global
warming
the
brothers
both
mit
graduates
funded
lobbyists
junk
scientists
and
conspiracy
theorists
to
propagate
an
alternative
reality
in
which
climate
science
is
always
contestable
and
any
policy
response
to
it
a
socialist
power-grab
a
new
book
on
the
brothers
operations
by
christopher
leonard
suggests
this
disinformation
campaign
began
as
early
as
in
a
successful
bid
to
prevent
george
h.w.
bush
fulfilling
his
pledge
to
curb
carbon
emissions
thereby
the
brothers
helped
corrupt
the
american
right
mislead
the
public
and
destroy
a
healthy
bipartisan
consensus
on
the
issue
mr
koch's
obituarists
have
tended
to
stress
either
the
good
or
bad
he
did
according
to
their
politics
the
settled
view
of
carnegie
that
his
philanthropy
was
great
and
his
business
practices
unconscionable
suggests
history's
judgment
will
be
more
clear-eyed
no
amount
of
charity
can
negate
the
damage
the
brothers
have
done
to
americans
trust
in
expert
opinion
as
well
as
to
the
environment
moreover
mr
koch's
philanthropy
like
carnegie's
was
to
some
degree
expedient
the
brothers
work
on
migrants
and
criminal
justice
though
in
earnest
was
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
improve
their
awful
public
image
carnegie
is
also
a
reminder
that
the
plutocratic
tendency
the
kochs
represent
is
not
new
but
cyclical
it
reflects
america's
enduring
ability
to
generate
huge
fortunes
complacency
about
concentrations
of
power
and
the
many
opportunities
its
diffuse
and
multilayered
democracy
provides
for
influence-peddling
the
steel
magnate
and
other
robber
barons
warded
off
political
challenges
to
their
monopolies
for
decades
before
woodrow
wilson
ended
them
that
led
to
a
period
of
populist
ferment
hostile
to
fat
cats
including
mass
strikes
and
ultimately
the
new
deal
of
the
s
but
the
growth
and
changes
in
business
culture
of
the
s
re-establishing
the
power
of
owners
over
workers
fuelled
a
new
wave
of
corporate
activism
which
the
kochs
illustrate
they
were
more
consistent
in
their
beliefs
than
carnegie
a
protectionist
until
he
sold
his
steel
mills
then
a
free-trader
yet
their
war
on
regulation
especially
of
carbon
emissions
was
squarely
in
the
interests
of
their
shareholders
themselves
as
a
private
company
they
were
freer
than
their
rivals
to
make
long-term
investments
in
such
efforts
the
kochtopus
as
the
brothers
political
network
is
known
is
believed
to
have
employees
three
times
as
many
as
the
republican
national
committee
this
represents
the
broader
trend
a
relentless
and
generally
effective
increase
in
corporate
lobbying
but
is
the
tide
now
turning
against
it
the
extent
to
which
the
kochs
priorities
have
been
subsumed
by
donald
trump's
populism
suggests
it
could
be
the
president's
apprehension
that
the
brothers
anti-government
views
were
not
shared
by
many
republican
voters
was
his
major
insight
and
though
he
has
brought
about
some
things
they
like
chiefly
tax
cuts
and
the
dismantling
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
he
has
also
given
them
protectionism
and
insults
last
year
he
called
them
a
total
joke
meanwhile
in
the
democratic
primaries
elizabeth
warren
and
others
promise
a
new
campaign
against
billionaire
influencers
which
polls
suggest
would
be
wildly
popular
yet
though
neither
party
seems
likely
to
revert
to
the
republicans
former
state
of
corporate
vassalage
a
sweeping
corporate
retreat
is
unlikelier
still
in
part
that
is
because
the
left
is
almost
as
beholden
to
rich
people
as
the
right
its
most
free-spending
presidential
candidate
tom
steyer
is
a
billionaire
financier
who
also
promises
to
smite
the
powerful
and
well-connected
yet
it
is
mainly
because
the
political
economy
is
vastly
more
complicated
than
a
century
ago
and
its
institutions
including
political
parties
and
the
media
weaker
the
opportunities
for
buying
influence
this
throws
up
would
be
legion
even
if
a
democratic
administration
reformed
campaign-finance
laws
the
kochs
effort
to
spread
climate-change
scepticism
also
illustrates
this
it
is
said
to
have
cost
them
around
m
that
is
pocket-change
for
charles
koch
whose
political
commitments
will
in
no
way
be
lessened
by
his
brother's
demise
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
