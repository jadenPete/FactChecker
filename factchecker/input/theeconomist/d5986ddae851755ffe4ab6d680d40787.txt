patrick
shanahan
stands
aside
from
the
dod
this
is
not
the
usual
trump
administration
scandal
there
are
three
reasons
people
are
ejected
from
the
top
echelons
of
president
donald
trump's
administration
either
past
personal
failings
come
to
light
or
petty
self-dealing
scandals
emerge
while
in
office
or
they
suffer
a
sudden
decline
in
the
appraisal
of
a
mercurial
boss
who
likes
a
good
firing
now
and
again
ronny
jackson
the
president's
personal
doctor
who
was
appointed
to
run
the
department
of
veteran
affairs
bowed
out
after
allegations
emerged
of
drinking
on
the
job
and
carelessly
dispensing
opioids
scott
pruitt
the
former
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
tom
price
the
former
health
secretary
got
the
boot
after
their
lavish
spending
habits
overstuffed
security
details
private-plane
travel
caused
considerable
embarrassment
rex
tillerson
the
former
secretary
of
state
and
kirstjen
nielsen
the
former
homeland
security
secretary
irked
mr
trump
and
on
june
th
the
nomination
of
patrick
shanahan
the
acting
defence
secretary
to
succeed
to
the
permanent
post
imploded
after
details
of
mr
shanahan's
personal
life
were
published
by
american
newspapers
mr
shanahan
has
been
doing
the
job
since
general
jim
mattis
resigned
done
for
by
number
three
unlike
the
failed
nominations
of
andrew
puzder
as
labour
secretary
and
herman
cain
as
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve's
board
or
the
ignominious
sacking
of
rob
porter
the
white
house
staff
secretary
mr
shanahan
was
not
accused
of
groping
anyone
instead
there
were
two
episodes
in
the
first
mr
shanahan's
wife
at
the
time
was
arrested
in
on
domestic-violence
charges
after
she
punched
him
in
the
face
in
the
second
in
mr
shanahan's
year-old
son
beat
his
mother
with
a
baseball
bat
leaving
her
with
a
fractured
skull
and
needing
surgery
mr
shanahan
who
was
in
seattle
at
the
time
working
for
boeing
flew
to
florida
where
the
assault
occurred
and
tried
to
provide
a
legal
defence
for
his
son
to
spare
him
jail
time
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
assault
he
wrote
a
memo
claiming
that
his
son
had
acted
in
self-defence
he
told
the
washington
post
that
the
characterisation
was
made
before
he
had
all
the
facts
and
that
he
was
wrong
to
write
it
when
it
became
clear
that
the
news
would
break
mr
shanahan
travelled
to
the
oval
office
to
withdraw
his
nomination
mr
shanahan's
predicament
appears
agonising
his
difficulties
do
not
elicit
the
same
moral
outrage
as
some
of
mr
trump's
other
nominations
did
yet
they
do
illuminate
the
problem
of
a
patchy
vetting
process
and
an
impetuous
chief
executive
who
sometimes
picks
people
simply
because
they
look
the
part
of
the
top
posts
in
the
government
which
require
the
affirmation
of
the
senate
only
are
filled
by
confirmed
appointees
the
department
of
defence
is
perhaps
america's
most
important
ministry
particularly
now
tensions
with
iran
are
high
more
troops
have
just
been
dispatched
to
the
middle
east
the
temporary
replacement
to
the
previous
temporary
replacement
is
mark
esper
a
west
point
classmate
of
mike
pompeo
the
hawkish
secretary
of
state
mr
esper
is
a
supporter
of
dispatching
troops
to
the
southern
border
which
allows
mr
trump
to
portray
illegal
immigration
as
an
invasion
if
the
polls
are
tight
next
autumn
expect
to
see
mr
esper
deploy
more
soldiers
to
guard
the
rio
grande
supposing
he
lasts
that
long
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
