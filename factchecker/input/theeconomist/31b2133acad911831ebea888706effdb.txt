harvey
weinstein's
trials
the
case
that
started
metoo
demonstrates
the
difficulty
of
making
sexual-assault
accusations
stick
this
case
is
testing
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
our
country
harvey
weinstein's
then
defence
lawyer
jose
baez
told
reporters
last
january
cameras
shuttering
as
the
movie
mogul
shuffled
out
of
a
new
york
courthouse
for
a
man
who
the
state
attorney-general
says
required
his
drivers
to
keep
condoms
and
erectile
dysfunction
injections
in
the
car
at
all
times
that
is
undeniably
true
but
the
justice
system's
ability
to
hold
those
accused
of
sexual
crimes
to
account
is
also
being
tested
the
low
conviction
rates
for
rape
and
sexual
assault
are
often
blamed
on
under-reporting
less
than
a
quarter
of
estimated
sexual
assaults
are
reported
to
police
no
such
excuse
exists
in
the
weinstein
case
since
late-
he
has
been
accused
by
more
than
women
of
acts
ranging
from
harassment
to
rape
the
main
villain
of
metoo
has
lost
his
company
reputation
wife
and
some
hair
but
bar
an
ankle
tracker
he
retains
his
liberty
and
much
of
his
fortune
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
justice
system
will
take
either
most
of
mr
weinstein's
accusers
are
not
going
to
court
expired
statutes
of
limitation
or
other
legal
hurdles
prevent
some
others
do
not
wish
to
go
through
a
gruelling
public
trial
well
over
a
dozen
are
suing
for
damages
through
civil
procedures
though
the
new
york
attorney-general
has
also
filed
a
civil-rights
suit
against
mr
weinstein
his
brother
and
their
former
company
for
endangering
employees
and
the
year-old
faces
criminal
charges
for
allegedly
attacking
two
women
in
and
if
found
guilty
mr
weinstein
who
denies
all
charges
of
non-consensual
sex
could
spend
decades
in
prison
his
much-delayed
criminal
trial
is
set
for
september
th
it
may
be
delayed
again
after
mr
baez
asked
the
court
to
excuse
him
from
the
case
making
him
the
second
member
of
mr
weinstein's
defence
team
to
walk
away
in
quick
succession
women
in
america
britain
and
canada
are
suing
for
damages
related
to
what
one
of
their
lawyers
calls
weinstein
events
involving
allegations
such
as
rape
assault
false
imprisonment
for
instance
holding
a
woman
while
he
masturbated
and
career
sabotage
they
are
going
after
not
just
mr
weinstein
but
also
the
companies
that
employed
him
miramax
disney
and
the
weinstein
company
twc
at
twc
his
contract
included
an
unusual
clause
which
listed
escalating
financial
penalties
for
using
company
resources
to
pay
someone
off
if
he
acted
improperly
in
violation
of
the
company's
code
of
conduct
in
may
rumours
appeared
in
the
media
of
an
imminent
global
settlement
for
m
that
would
close
most
civil
suits
twc
is
currently
going
through
the
bankruptcy
process
and
some
attorneys
such
as
elizabeth
fegan
who
represents
several
plaintiffs
in
a
class
action
believe
this
is
the
best
hope
for
getting
compensation
several
accusers
including
actresses
ashley
judd
and
rose
mcgowan
quickly
distanced
themselves
from
any
rumoured
settlement
part
of
the
problem
was
the
amount
less
than
half
of
the
m
that
had
been
suggested
in
early
nearly
a
third
of
which
would
be
reserved
for
the
legal
fees
of
mr
weinstein's
co-accused
directors
and
board
members
going
after
mr
weinstein's
enablers
has
been
a
priority
for
financial
reasons
as
well
as
moral
ones
at
the
end
of
all
of
this
given
all
his
legal
fees
we
expect
that
mr
weinstein
himself
will
be
relatively
asset
light
says
ms
fegan
for
those
seeking
the
sort
of
justice
that
involves
steel
bars
mr
weinstein's
criminal
trial
will
be
the
one
to
watch
it
has
been
marred
by
delays
and
false
starts
charges
relating
to
a
third
woman
were
dropped
after
a
police
blunder
something
mr
weinstein's
lawyers
argue
taints
the
whole
case
the
remaining
five
criminal
charges
are
serious
they
concern
a
woman
who
claims
mr
weinstein
forcibly
performed
oral
sex
on
her
in
and
a
woman
who
says
he
raped
her
in
the
crimes
he
is
accused
of
include
predatory
sexual
assault
a
class
a
felony
rape
in
the
first
degree
and
rape
in
the
third
degree
proving
such
charges
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
criminal
court
will
be
hard
the
case
will
probably
centre
around
forcible
compulsion
or
for
the
least
serious
offence
whether
the
victim
clearly
expressed
non-consent
predicts
margo
kaplan
of
rutgers
university
she
believes
new
york's
broad
definition
of
consent
is
particularly
victim-unfriendly
the
assumption
that
women
by
default
always
consent
to
sex
unless
they
are
forced
or
clearly
state
otherwise
makes
rape
hard
to
prove
in
many
jurisdictions
prosecutors
less
likely
to
pursue
charges
and
convictions
of
watered-down
charges
more
likely
more
important
than
the
letter
of
the
law
will
be
the
mood
of
the
jury
cultural
norms
determine
judgments
in
rape
cases
far
more
than
legal
definitions
found
dan
kahan
a
professor
in
law
and
psychology
at
yale
in
a
study
working
in
mr
weinstein's
favour
is
the
fact
that
he
is
on
bail
which
studies
have
shown
greatly
increases
his
chances
of
acquittal
beyond
that
his
chances
now
directly
relate
to
his
lawyers
ability
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
his
accusers
predicts
daniel
hochheiser
a
criminal
defence
attorney
their
job
may
be
about
to
get
harder
as
the
court
considers
whether
other
women
should
be
allowed
to
testify
about
mr
weinstein
this
strategy
aimed
at
demonstrating
a
pattern
of
abuse
was
successful
in
helping
convince
the
jury
at
the
bill
cosby
retrial
last
year
of
the
comedian's
guilt
for
several
women
it
was
also
cathartic
but
it
is
controversial
and
mr
weinstein's
lawyers
have
fought
hard
against
it
one
problem
for
prosecutors
in
sexual-misconduct
cases
is
that
each
accusation
tends
to
be
treated
as
a
one-off
which
makes
it
far
easier
for
the
defence
to
argue
it
was
a
he
said
she
said
settlements
with
gag-clauses
make
it
yet
harder
to
give
a
jury
more
context
just
as
most
civil
cases
are
dismissed
or
settled
before
trial
so
over
of
criminal
cases
are
either
thrown
out
or
settled
with
a
plea-bargain
before
trial
lack
of
resources
or
the
hope
of
a
shortened
sentence
can
push
poorer
and
younger
suspects
into
taking
a
plea
but
are
less
likely
to
persuade
mr
weinstein
the
prospect
of
facing
not
just
two
isolated
women
but
a
couple
of
platoons
may
push
him
towards
a
deal
should
one
be
offered
yet
given
the
high-profile
nature
of
the
case
and
the
severity
of
the
charges
insiders
predict
that
the
prosecutor
is
unlikely
to
do
so
and
would
prefer
to
roll
the
dice
in
trial
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
