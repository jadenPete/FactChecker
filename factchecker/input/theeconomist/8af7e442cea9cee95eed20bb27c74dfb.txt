chicago's
troubled
police
force
gets
federal
oversight
how
much
difference
will
this
make
to
the
way
officers
behave
for
me
nothing's
gonna
change
says
a
police
sergeant
hands
on
hips
huddled
with
colleagues
in
a
station
in
a
scruffy
violent
district
on
chicago's
west
side
he
sounds
relaxed
as
the
city
begins
its
term
under
a
consent
decree
a
court-ordered
process
that
imposes
federal
monitors
to
oversee
police
reforms
if
you're
a
good
officer
it
won't
change
anything
agrees
another
man
in
uniform
as
they
will
soon
discover
much
in
fact
will
have
to
be
done
differently
if
a
history
of
often
unconstitutional
policing
in
the
windy
city
is
to
end
even
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
have
cut
murder
rates
to
historic
lows
over
the
past
three
decades
chicago's
remain
three
times
higher
officers
have
long
proved
trigger-happy
and
quick
to
cover
up
colleagues
wrongdoing
one
calculation
in
found
that
they
fired
at
a
member
of
the
public
every
five
days
and
had
killed
people
in
the
previous
six
years
and
young
black
men
are
overwhelmingly
the
victims
of
police
abuse
reform
in
chicago
has
been
hampered
by
strong
police
unions
and
politicians
who
dared
not
make
enemies
by
confronting
the
men
in
blue
chicago
long
failed
for
example
to
train
its
officers
properly
eddie
johnson
the
superintendent
recalls
he
was
educated
in
use-of-force
rules
as
a
novice
at
the
police
academy
in
but
not
retrained
for
years
until
he
became
the
top
cop
in
mr
johnson's
appointment
came
after
protests
over
an
egregious
killing
in
which
a
white
officer
was
filmed
shooting
a
disoriented
black
teenager
laquan
mcdonald
times
in
the
officer
was
convicted
of
murder
a
rarity
in
chicago
last
october
since
then
a
new
pointing
policy
discourages
quick
draws
though
it
has
caused
consternation
in
the
force
mr
johnson
said
recently
that
officers
grumbled
so
much
it
is
the
bane
of
my
life
though
he
talks
of
other
recent
improvements
such
as
officers
use
of
body
cameras
he
admits
that
difficulties
linger
these
include
ongoing
use
of
racist
techniques
and
the
fact
we
treat
part
of
the
city
inappropriately
he
means
his
police
are
most
likely
to
abuse
latino
or
black
residents
this
mr
johnson
reckons
is
the
fault
of
a
few
rotten
apples
we
need
to
identify
the
bad
actors
and
get
them
out
in
reality
the
problems
are
structural
the
compensation
doled
out
for
wrongdoing
by
his
force
provides
an
illustration
since
such
settlements
plus
interest
have
amounted
to
over
m
not
far
off
the
bn
annual
budget
for
the
police
in
the
city
agreed
to
pay
reparations
of
m
to
victims
of
a
detective
jon
burge
who
led
a
team
known
as
the
midnight
crew
for
much
of
the
s
and
s
they
beat
burned
raped
electrocuted
or
subjected
to
mock
executions
suspects
probably
many
more
to
get
confessions
such
systemic
failings
explain
why
the
mayor
rahm
emanuel
at
last
agreed
to
a
consent
decree
he
says
that
after
seven
attempts
in
years
to
reform
he
is
proud
that
bigger
changes
will
come
the
decree
was
in
the
works
for
two
years
as
first
the
justice
department
and
then
illinois's
attorney-general
demanded
it
it
allows
federal
monitors
to
insist
on
openness
and
accountability
across
many
departments
not
only
the
police
says
walter
katz
who
negotiated
for
the
city
the
experiences
of
other
cities
which
have
had
decrees
such
as
los
angeles
suggest
it
will
last
a
decade
or
more
consent
decrees
were
made
possible
by
legislation
from
passed
after
riots
in
in
los
angeles
sparked
by
the
acquittal
of
police
officers
who
had
beat
a
black
motorist
rodney
king
the
justice
department
each
year
has
typically
picked
two
or
three
targets
for
reform
from
police
departments
it
usually
responds
to
a
prominent
case
of
police
malpractice
according
to
a
justice
department
review
of
two
decades
use
of
decrees
there
have
been
formal
investigations
and
decrees
covering
police
departments
do
they
work
because
they
apply
to
only
a
few
of
america's
police
departments
it
is
hard
to
prove
that
consent
decrees
lead
to
fewer
police
shootings
america's
police
killed
people
in
on
a
par
with
recent
years
but
stephen
rushin
of
loyola
university
in
chicago
author
of
a
book
on
consent
decrees
says
their
benefits
far
outweigh
costs
he
says
police
use
less
categorical
force
when
being
monitored
meaning
acts
that
send
members
of
the
public
to
hospital
rather
than
a
morgue
surveys
also
often
show
that
public
support
for
the
police
rises
when
decrees
are
in
place
and
mr
rushin
argues
that
cities
can
expect
to
pay
less
in
civil
suits
after
decrees
take
effect
what
of
objections
that
constrained
police
are
less
able
to
get
on
with
arresting
criminals
heather
macdonald
author
of
the
war
on
cops
has
argued
that
violent
crime
rises
when
police
pull
back
from
proactive
measures
such
as
stop-and-frisks
of
potential
suspects
in
she
said
that
increases
in
violence
in
cities
like
chicago
or
baltimore
could
be
because
police
felt
hamstrung
mr
rushin
aided
by
evidence
from
the
past
couple
of
years
in
which
crime
began
to
fall
again
rejects
that
he
agrees
that
consent
decrees
hurt
police
morale
and
could
make
officers
leave
his
study
of
depolicing
did
suggest
a
short-lived
but
significant
uptick
in
some
crime
rates
when
police
complain
of
growing
pains
from
external
oversight
but
he
suggests
this
involves
property
crime
not
the
violent
sort
in
the
case
of
gun
violence
police
typically
reacted
to
shootings
and
did
not
act
proactively
to
prevent
them
nor
does
he
see
arrest
rates
generally
falling
beyond
chicago
the
chance
for
new
research
on
decrees
will
be
limited
under
barack
obama
the
justice
department
was
keen
on
decrees
but
donald
trump's
administration
has
frozen
them
saying
state
or
local
authorities
not
federal
ones
should
take
charge
that
stance
won
mr
trump
support
from
police
unions
just
as
it
infuriated
civil-rights
activists
that
need
not
mean
the
end
of
reforms
however
individual
cities
can
study
the
justice
departments's
investigations
of
police
departments
and
find
ideas
for
change
the
best
processes
are
often
the
most
open
in
chicago
the
first
draft
of
the
consent
decree
was
made
public
passed
round
focus
groups
including
police
officers
and
took
hundreds
of
hours
to
negotiate
mr
rushin
thinks
more
open-minded
police
departments
state
and
local
governments
can
find
lessons
to
apply
for
themselves
even
without
federal
pressure
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
