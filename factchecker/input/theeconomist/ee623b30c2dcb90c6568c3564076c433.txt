where
female
athletes
are
more
popular
than
male
ones
and
still
get
paid
less
excited
fans
in
bald
eagle
baseball
caps
watched
as
the
united
states
women's
football
team
beat
spain
to
progress
to
the
quarter-finals
of
the
world
cup
on
june
th
this
was
no
shock
upset
the
stars
and
stripes
are
the
most
successful
side
in
the
history
of
women's
football
having
won
the
world
cup
three
times
and
olympic
gold
four
this
year
they
romped
through
the
group
stages
with
an
aggregate
score
of
a
total
inflated
by
their
record-breaking
drubbing
of
lowly
thailand
this
on-pitch
success
however
is
marred
by
controversy
in
court
the
members
of
the
united
states
women's
team
marked
international
women's
day
on
march
th
by
filing
a
class-action
suit
against
their
employer
the
united
states
soccer
federation
ussf
the
suit
alleged
that
differences
in
pay
and
employment
conditions
between
the
women's
and
men's
team
violate
the
equal
pay
act
and
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
despite
engaging
in
substantially
equal
work
the
women's
team
is
paid
considerably
less
if
each
team
were
to
play
friendlies
over
the
course
of
a
year
and
win
them
all
the
women
would
receive
whereas
the
men
would
net
according
to
the
filing
it
is
common
for
female
athletes
to
be
paid
less
than
men
the
combined
salaries
of
the
women
playing
in
the
top
seven
football
leagues
add
up
to
m
just
slightly
less
than
the
m
salary
paid
to
neymar
a
brazilian
forward
by
paris
saint-germain
but
football
in
america
is
unusual
because
the
women's
team
is
paid
less
than
the
men
despite
more
people
tuning
in
to
watch
them
such
pay
differences
are
permissible
if
the
employer
can
prove
that
one
of
four
affirmative
defences
apply
a
seniority
system
a
merit
system
a
pay
system
based
on
quantity
or
quality
of
output
or
any
other
factor
apart
from
sex
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
ussf
to
prove
that
the
disparity
can
be
legitimately
explained
by
one
of
these
four
the
federation
has
attributed
the
discrepancy
to
differences
in
the
aggregate
revenue
generated
by
the
different
teams
and
or
any
other
factor
other
than
sex
the
success
of
the
lawsuit
depends
on
whether
this
is
true
a
wall
street
journal
investigation
into
audited
financial
reports
from
the
ussf
suggests
that
it
is
not
between
and
women's
games
generated
about
m
in
revenue
the
men
took
in
about
m
that
alone
is
not
enough
to
settle
the
case
this
money
came
mostly
from
ticket
sales
but
that
is
not
the
only
source
of
revenue
attributable
to
the
national
teams
much
of
it
comes
from
broadcast
rights
and
sponsorship
deals
as
these
are
bundled
together
it
is
difficult
to
assess
how
much
ought
to
be
attributed
to
each
team
it
is
however
hard
to
believe
that
the
men's
team
whose
best
result
has
been
third
place
in
the
world
cup
and
who
failed
to
qualify
last
time
round
is
such
a
sought-after
commodity
as
to
justify
the
pay
disparity
having
qualified
for
the
knockout
stages
of
the
world
cup
the
female
players
agreed
to
pursue
mediation
once
the
tournament
ends
this
is
unlikely
to
resolve
the
matter
legal
disputes
over
equal
pay
have
been
going
on
since
five
players
filed
a
complaint
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
march
this
has
effectively
been
subsumed
by
the
class-action
suit
a
previous
effort
at
mediation
fell
apart
in
march
the
team
is
now
two
matches
away
from
the
final
at
the
parc
olympique
lyonnais
whether
they
make
it
there
will
be
decided
on
the
pitch
how
they
are
compensated
for
their
efforts
is
likely
to
be
decided
in
court
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
