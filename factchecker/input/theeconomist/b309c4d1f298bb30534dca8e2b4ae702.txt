donald
trump's
real
target
is
not
illegal
immigration
but
diversity
that
battle
is
already
lost
when
juan
garcia
started
work
as
an
urban
planner
for
the
government
of
gaston
county
in
he
reckons
he
was
the
only
latino
among
its
employees
hub
of
a
dying
textiles
industry
on
the
western
edge
of
charlotte
the
county
was
missing
out
on
the
boom
already
rippling
through
the
periphery
of
north
carolina's
most
dynamic
city
for
that
reason
gastonia
its
altogether
less
zippy
capital
was
not
seeing
many
of
the
mexican
immigrants
then
pouring
into
the
state
to
labour
on
the
building
sites
erupting
in
charlotte
and
revive
the
poultry
industry
in
union
county
east
of
the
city
but
this
was
about
to
change
finding
opportunities
overlooked
by
others
in
gastonia's
run-down
factories
and
mills
migrants
started
settling
in
the
town's
trailer
parks
and
poor
black
neighbourhoods
its
hispanic
population
soared
to
around
or
of
the
total
within
a
few
years
this
caused
friction
with
gastonia's
white
majority

mr
garcia
who
was
born
in

they're

than

they
might
slaughter
a
chicken
in
their
yard
they
play
loud
music
there
but
the
ill-will
rarely
went
beyond
grumbling
about
the
migrants
poor
english
some
in
gastonia
said
this
reflected
the
much
deeper
tensions
in
the
south
between
whites
and
blacks
resentment
of
immigrants
was
only
a
brief
distraction
from
that
main
drama
in
any
event
the
migrants
many
of
whom
had
either
moved
from
texas
or
come
directly
from
the
rio
grande
expected
no
favours
so
long
as
you
treat
people
the
right
way
you're
all
right

the
influx

the
town
and
hundreds
of
unfashionable
cities
like
it
illustrates
how
much
they
have
changed
america
over
the
past
three
decades
the
hispanic
population
has
risen
ninefold
since
the
s
to
around
m
its
members
many
of
them
second-
and
third-generation
immigrants
are
dispersing
across
the
country
driving
growth
and
changing
the
social
fabric
wherever
they
go
while
the
white
population
is
on
the
cusp
of
declining
most
states
have
flourishing
hispanic
communities
north
carolina
which
had

in
now
has
almost
a

the
high
growth
rates
it
has
meanwhile
sustained
owe
a
lot
to
this
migrant
infusion
to
men
like

words

popped

surviving

thus
have
gastonia's
hispanics
filled
gaps
in
its
old
industries
taking
low-skilled
jobs
that
blacks
and
whites
no
longer
want
meanwhile
the
many
small
landscaping
and

businesses
they
launched
have
forged
an
overdue
connection
between
gastonia
and
the
new
services-based
economy

the
south

catawba
river
in

recognising
the
community's
importance
as
well
as
its
needs
gaston
county
now
employs
over
hispanic
public
servants
with
a
premium
on
bilingual
doctors
nurses
and
social
workers
this
transformation
is
the
essential
context
in
which
to
view
donald
trump's
talk
of
a
crisis
at
the
southern
border
the
president
appears
to
be
motivated
less
by
genuine
concern
for
the
state
of
the
border
than
by
his
white
supporters
feelings
of
anxiety
over
demographic
change
his
promise
of
a
border-wall
which
few
immigration
experts
think
america
needs
following
a
steep
decline
in
the
number
of
illegal
crossings
is
a
sign
of
that
in
fact
were
mr
trump
not
so
obviously
using
his
promised
border-wall
as
a
political
device
he
might
have
built
one
by
now
last
year
he
turned
down
an
offer
from
the
democrats
that
would
have
given
him
wall
money
in
return
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
far
more
money
than
his
emergency
is
likely
to
get
him
in
short
the
physical
promise
of
the
wall
is
largely
a
figment
it
is
a
symbol
of
mr
trump's
tacit
pledge
to
his
white
supporters
to
defend
them
against
the
diversifying
of
american
society
that
many
fear
it
is
too
late
for
that
however
most
of
the
growth
in
america's
hispanic
population
is
the
result
of
natural
increase
not
immigration
mr
trump's
nativist
stand
is
positively
canute-like
it
also
carries
great
costs
the
most
important
is
the
forgone
opportunity
to
cauterise
america's
immigration
sore
that
his
presidency
represents
the
anxiety
of
mr
trump's
followers
is
exacerbated
explained
even
by
the
chaotic
legacy
of
decades
of
illegal
immigration
it
stands
to
reason
that
america's
roughly
m
illegal
migrants
most
of
whom
are
hispanic
are
willing
to
work
harder
in
tougher
conditions
than
indigenous
people
economists
may
argue
over
the
effect
of
that
on
wages
but
it
is
a
theoretical
disadvantage
to
natives
that
they
are
bound
to
resent
meanwhile
the
insecurity
illegal
migrants
live
with
is
a
barrier
to
assimilation
which
also
causes
tension
it
was
fairly
amazing
that
most
of
the
shoppers
in
las
americas
despite
having
spent
years
in
america
spoke
little
or
no
english
the
answer
to
these
tangled
problems
has
long
been
clear
america
needs
to
regularise
the
status
of
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
while
further
improving
border
security
to
win
consent
for
that
change
given
mr
trump's
hold
on
the
nativist
right
he
could
have
done
this
yet
that
would
have
required
him
to
want
to
fix
the
mess
and
not
seek
to
profit
from
it
the
pay-off
for
his
party
will
be
short-lived
however
because
of
another
development
among
hispanics
for
several
reasons
including
the
fact
that
many
are
illegal
and
unable
to
vote
their
political
clout
has
lagged
behind
their
numerical
rise
in
north
carolina
they
are
of
the
population
and
of
registered
voters
yet
hispanic
citizens
are
now
entering
the
property-owning
middle-class
in
vast
numbers
the
looming
calamity
for
republicans
who
have
done
so
much
to
alienate
them
is
that
such
people
vote
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
