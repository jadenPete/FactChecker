congress
fails
to
claw
back
the
right
to
wage
war
president
donald
trump
vetoes
a
law
to
end
america's
role
in
the
yemen
war
were
the
founding
fathers
to
return
suggested
michael
beschloss
a
historian
in
last
year's
presidents
of
war
they
would
be
thunderstruck
to
discover
how
the
power
to
kick
off
major
wars
could
now
rest
on
the
whim
of
a
president
presidents
have
regularly
told
congress
to
go
to
hell
on
such
matters
as
harry
truman
admiringly
noted
of
his
predecessor
james
polk
donald
trump
is
keeping
up
that
tradition
on
april
th
he
wielded
his
veto
for
only
the
second
time
in
his
presidency
to
strike
down
a
groundbreaking
law
that
might
have
forced
him
to
end
america's
support
for
the
saudi-led
war
against
the
houthi
militia
in
yemen
the
fighting
has
caused
what
the
un
calls
the
world's
worst
humanitarian
crisis
that
the
bill
got
so
far
so
quickly
is
notable
in
itself
it
sped
through
congress
passing
even
the
republican-controlled
the
senate
on
th
march
and
the
house
on
th
april
because
of
expedited
procedures
never
before
used
granted
by
the
war
powers
resolution
wpr
this
act
was
passed
in
in
response
to
richard
nixon's
secretive
expansion
of
the
vietnam
war
in
theory
the
wpr
tied
presidents
hands
by
requiring
them
first
to
consult
congress
before
sending
forces
abroad
and
then
to
ask
congress
for
a
declaration
of
war
or
a
specific
mandate
to
keep
them
there
beyond
days
in
practice
most
presidents
have
either
stretched
or
ignored
the
law
much
of
the
recent
stretching
has
occurred
as
a
result
of
america's
sprawling
war
on
terror
three
days
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
th
congress
passed
an
authorisation
for
use
of
military
force
aumf
permitting
george
bush
to
go
after
those
who
planned
authorised
committed
or
aided
the
atrocity
that
was
clearly
a
reference
to
al-qaeda
then
holed
up
in
afghanistan
but
by
the
aumf
had
been
used
by
mr
bush
and
his
successor
barack
obama
times
to
justify
action
in
countries
even
against
groups
that
did
not
exist
on
points
out
christopher
anders
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
mr
obama
for
instance
deployed
the
aumf
in
defence
of
his
war
on
islamic
state
in
iraq
and
syria
even
though
the
group
angrily
split
from
al-qaeda
long
ago
however
the
wpr
was
gutted
long
before
the
elastic
aumf
created
loopholes
wide
enough
to
fly
f-
s
through
most
presidents
after
nixon
have
simply
ignored
it
declaring
its
demands
to
be
an
unconstitutional
infringement
on
their
executive
powers
some
presidents
have
tried
to
conjure
up
a
mandate
in
dubious
ways
when
the
kosovo
war
crossed
the
day
mark
in
bill
clinton
insisted
that
congress
had
expressed
approval
by
ponying
up
money
for
it
never
mind
that
the
wpr
explicitly
says
that
does
not
count
and
that
lawmakers
are
loth
to
cut
off
funds
for
troops
in
the
line
of
fire
the
most
inventive
approach
has
been
to
pretend
that
contrary
to
appearances
there
is
in
fact
no
war
in
mr
obama
said
he
was
free
to
bomb
libya
because
the
action
was
led
by
nato
did
not
involve
sustained
fighting
or
active
exchanges
of
fire
and
was
unlikely
to
escalate
and
so
did
not
meet
the
definition
of
hostilities
envisaged
by
the
wpr
mr
trump
has
put
forward
much
the
same
argument
for
his
own
entanglement
in
yemen
which
started
under
mr
obama
indeed
had
he
signed
the
yemen
bill
rather
than
nixing
it
it
is
likely
that
his
administration
would
have
claimed
its
provisions
did
not
apply
to
yemen
anyway
lawmakers
are
right
to
roll
their
eyes
at
such
make-believe
after
all
american
commanders
sit
in
an
operations
room
in
riyadh

to
their
saudi
counterparts
american

saudi

mid-flight

is

meanwhile
the
fighting
has
left
ten

yemenis
one

away

congress
though
exasperated
does
not
have
the
numbers
to
override
mr
trump's
veto
but
it
is
likely
to
continue
the
fight
in
other
ways
such
as
by
tacking
riders
onto
the
annual
national
defence
authorisation
act
which
is
much
trickier
for
the
president
to
quash
