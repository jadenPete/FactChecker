joe
biden
provides
a
fossil
record
of
how
the
democrats
have
changed
the
former
vice-president
will
have
to
show
he
has
changed
with
it
entering
to
bruce
springsteen's
we
take
care
of
our
own
as
his
friend
barack
obama
used
to
joe
biden
performed
a
dress
rehearsal
for
his
long-awaited
entry
to
the
democratic
primary
in
washington
dc
earlier
this
month
his
audience
burly
delegates
of
the
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers
were
the
sort
of
working-class
voters
the
year-old
former
vice-president
is
counting
on
to
nullify
the
hard-left
he
duly
regaled
them
with
familiar
lines
about
scranton
the
pennsylvanian
mining-town
his
family
fled
almost
seven
decades
ago
he
also
cracked
gags
about
the
recent
controversy
over
his
career-long
habit
of
sniffing
kissing
and
pawing
at
women
i
just
want
you
to
know
he
deadpanned
to
the
union
men
twinkly
old
uncle
joe
style
that
he
had
permission
to
hug
their
leader
if
that
is
how
mr
biden
who
enters
the
primary
this
week
as
the
front-runner
means
to
handle
his
long
and
spotted
history
of
statements
and
behaviour
anathema
to
the
modern
democratic
party
he
might
not
last
long
as
things
stand
he
owes
his
lead
status
to
propitious
circumstances
including
the
apparent
lack
of
an
outstanding
alternative
and
his
association
with
the
revered
mr
obama
there
is
an
obvious
risk
that
he
will
fizzle
as
he
did
during
two
previous
presidential
runs
when
he
was
an
outsider
and
much
less
of
a
target
to
his
opponents
than
he
is
now
mr
biden
is
knowledgeable
likeable
right-minded
hugely
experienced
and
polished
in
the
way
of
an
old-style
variety
show
host
the
way
he
glides
up
and
down
the
emotional
register
one
moment
seething
the
next
lachrymose
is
something
to
behold
he
is
also
garrulous
gaffe-prone
and
not
obviously
au
fait
with
modern
america
in
other
words
he
has
work
to
do
assuming
he
has
the
energy
for
it
meanwhile
the
suspicion
that
his
candidacy
is
an
anachronism
makes
it
an
extreme
test-case
for
the
democrats
biggest
dilemma
how
to
reconcile
the
ideological
purity
demanded
by
an
activist
wing
increasingly
dedicated
to
racial
gender
and
sexual
equality
with
the
real
world
of
muddy
compromises
and
more
mixed
social
attitudes
this
tension
in
the
party
is
in
part
a
product
of
the
erosion
of
its
unionised
base
which
has
left
it
with
a
more
fractured
coalition
of
hipsters
minorities
and
immigrants
such
diversity
requires
constant
management
leading
to
an
almost
fetishistic
attention
to
liberal
unifying
principles
by
democratic
activists
which
engenders
intolerance
this
is
at
odds
with
the
more
nuanced
views
of
most
voters
mr
biden's
partnership
with
mr
obama
the
hip
son
of
an
african
migrant
bridged
the
gap
the
question
is
whether
the
bridge
can
still
stand
in
the
absence
of
its
obama-sized
pier
hence
the
early
attention
to
the
many
ways
mr
biden
over
the
course
of
a
career
in
democratic
politics
that
began
when
the
party
still
contained
segregationists
has
offended
against
contemporary
liberal
standards
early
examples
include
his
dismissive
treatment
as
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
of
anita
hill
a
black
woman
who
accused
clarence
thomas
of
sexual
harassment
during
his
supreme
court
confirmation
hearing
mr
biden's
disdainful
attitude
towards
busing
as
a
means
to
racially
integrate
schools
and
his
support
for
bill
clinton's
draconian
criminal-justice
reforms
more
such
examples
will
arise
mr
biden
has
a
decades-long
reputation
for
stirring
controversy
and
his
current
main
rival
bernie
sanders
an
emerging
one
for
ruthlessness
certain
kinds
of
past
transgression
are
now
straightforwardly
disqualifying
among
democrats
in
light
of
metoo
mr
clinton
has
become
an
embarrassment
the
more
interesting
thing
about
mr
biden's
case
is
that
he
does
not
appear
guilty
of
anything
that
was
considered
inappropriate
at
the
time
his
mistreatment
of
ms
hill
reflected
the
usual
s
male
chauvinism
it
was
also
intended
to
help
a
black
man
reach
the
supreme
court
bench
similarly
some
of
his
policy
positions
have
come
to
seem
controversial
mainly
due
to
ignorance
about
their
circumstances
criminal-justice
reform
in
the
s
was
fuelled
by
a
fear
of
violent
crime
that
has
been
largely
forgotten
on
the
left
busing
was
in
many
places
counter-productive
it
exacerbated
racial
tension
and
left
schools
as
segregated
but
worse-run
than
they
were
before
these
contradictions
represent
a
challenge
to
the
democrats
liberal
mullahs
which
is
further
complicated
by
mr
biden's
mercurial
nature
american
politics
has
a
strong
redemption
tradition
yet
mr
biden's
career
is
not
merely
defined
by
a
relentless
and
contrite
movement
towards
more
liberal
positions
rather
he
has
always
been
broadly
liberal
but
with
a
propensity
to
lapse
he
started
work
on
the
violence
against
women
act
one
of
his
big
achievements
a
year
before
his
mishandling
of
ms
hill
this
makes
him
warts
and
all
as
contradictory
as
most
voters
and
in
that
sense
a
cautionary
lesson
for
the
purist
left
whether
it
can
learn
from
it
however
will
depend
less
on
mr
biden's
record
than
his
present
skill
at
explaining
defending
and
where
necessary
apologising
for
it
this
is
also
the
main
reason
to
worry
about
his
candidacy
the
past
is
never
past
it
is
always
present
mr
biden's
favourite
singer
mr
springsteen
once
said
in
the
same
way
political
skeletons
tend
to
do
damage
only
when
they
highlight
some
current
weakness
mr
sanders
had
no
trouble
brushing
off
his
patchy
history
on
gun
control
because
his
progressive
bona
fides
were
not
in
doubt
hillary
clinton's
callousness
towards
her
husband's
female
accusers
was
damaging
because
it
chimed
with
her
reputation
for
cynicism
mr
biden
who
enters
the
race
much-loved
on
the
left
despite
his
shortcomings
has
an
easier
opportunity
to
account
for
his
record
he
should
defend
his
support
for
criminal-justice
reform
explain
his
opposition
to
busing
and
apologise
to
ms
hill
and
to
anyone
upset
by
his
handsiness
but
does
he
have
the
contemporary
political
nous
to
make
such
necessary
judgments
and
the
discipline
to
stick
by
them
if
not
he
will
fail
because
those
are
also
the
biggest
questions
about
his
candidacy
that
is
why
his
recent
joking
about
groping
was
so
ominous
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
