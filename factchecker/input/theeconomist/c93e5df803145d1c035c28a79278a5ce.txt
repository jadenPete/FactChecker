america's
natural
kidneys
need
more
protection
not
less
why
draining
the
swamp
is
a
bad
idea
each
spring
visitors
flock
to
the
muscatatuck
wildlife
refuge
in
indiana
even
under
scudding
clouds
a
shallow
lake
shimmers
it
brims
with
aquatic
plants
and
is
lined
with
reeds
and
willows
at
least
types
of
dragonfly
jostle
for
space
four-toed
salamanders
muskrats
and
beavers
call
it
home
box
turtles
brave
roads
to
reach
it
even
the
odd
human
pops
by
farmers
gave
up
on
this
marginal
land
in
the
last
century
defeated
by
frequent
floods
in
the
s
the
area
won
national
protection
an
earthen
berm
was
built
to
keep
the
lake
in
place
the
restored
wetland
was
a
rare
success
tramping
around
its
muddy
edge
adam
ward
of
indiana
university
says
that
nine-tenths
of
the
state's
wetlands
have
been
filled
in
farmed
or
built
over
in
some
other
midwestern
states
the
loss
is
almost
total
insects
migrating
birds
and
other
wildlife
lose
their
habitats
as
a
result
and
humans
can
feel
the
loss
of
wetlands
too
todd
royer
also
of
indiana
university
points
out
that
they
have
many
uses
from
recreation
to
storing
flood
water
upstream
wetlands
once
slowed
the
release
of
rainwater
to
rivers
without
them
deluges
are
more
likely
downstream
such
as
those
now
swamping
cities
and
farms
along
the
mississippi
in
baton
rouge
louisiana
officials
said
this
week
that
the
river
had
been
at
flood
stage
for
more
than
days
surpassing
a
record
set
in
wetlands
also
clean
water
removing
pollutants
that
leach
into
rivers
and
contaminate
wells
mr
royer
calls
wetlands
the
kidneys
of
the
landscape
rivers
used
to
be
fouled
by

source
pollution
from
outlets
such
as
tanneries
or
factories
national
laws
like
the
clean
water
act
of
mostly
ended
that
the
lingering
problem
is
non-point
pollution
mostly
nitrates
washed
from
fields
and
suburban
lawns
or
phosphorus
pathogens
and
other
nasties
in
urban
wastewater
water
overloaded
with
nutrients
is
a
curse
it
takes
roughly
two
weeks
for
a
drop
entering
the
wabash
river
in
indiana
to
wend
its
way
via
the
mississippi
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
each
summer
algae
blooms
in
the
river
fed
by
nitrates
as
these
die
they
feed
bacteria
which
suck
oxygen
from
the
water
the
result
when
the
mississippi
gushes
into
the
brine
of
the
gulf
is
a
huge
oxygen-free
dead
zone
last
summer
the
hypoxic
area
covered
square
miles
as
the
cost
of
losing
wetlands
is
better
understood
the
case
for
protecting
them
should
strengthen
mr
ward
fears
the
reverse
is
happening
the
environmental
protection
agency
last
year
proposed
a
rule
to
redefine
and
almost
certainly
reduce
which
waters
come
under
the
clean
water
act
its
final
plan
which
will
probably
appear
this
autumn
is
expected
to
give
landowners
and
officials
rather
than
scientists
more
say
on
whether
a
body
of
surface
water
counts
as
a
flowing
stream
worth
looking
after
protection
of
many
wetlands
in
turn
depends
on
their
being
close
to
protected
streams
if
the
epa
pushes
on
with
its
plan
this
year
as
much
as
of
the
existing
wetlands
in
the
wabash
river
basin
could
lose
federal
protection
estimate
mr
ward
and
his
colleagues
in
a
recent
paper
states
could
continue
to
protect
water
but
without
strict
federal
rules
i
doubt
all
states
would
protect
wetlands
as
they
do
now
says
mr
ward
idyllic
corners
such
as
muscatatuck
may
become
more
precious
than
ever
and
the
dead
zone
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
may
grow
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the

go
what
to
expect
from
