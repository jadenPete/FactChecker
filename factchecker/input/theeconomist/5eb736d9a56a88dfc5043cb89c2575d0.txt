why
bull-riding
is
becoming
more
popular
it
is
america's
most
dangerous
sport
the
rider
is
young
pale
thin-boned
fragile-looking
in
a
narrow
pen
he
tightens
straps
and
lowers
himself
astride
the
bare
back
of
a
brown
kg
lb
bull
its
smell
and
that
of
a
dozen
more
behind
the
stage
is
intense
it
jolts
a
black
metal
gate
and
the
stage
vibrates
even
for
an
observer
standing
just
above
adrenalin
flows
thousands
roar
as
beast
and
man
fly
they
swirl
under
floodlights
the
bull
bucks
legs
high
off
the
sandy
arena
floor
until
the
rider
detaches
and
tumbles
upwards
mercifully
away
from
horns
and
wild
hooves
aloft
and
rotating
for
an
improbably
long
time
then
he
crumples
in
the
dirt
as
with
seven
out
of
ten
such
efforts
the
rider
did
not
stay
on
for
the
eight
seconds
considered
necessary
he
collects
bruises
but
no
points
bull
riding
used
to
be
one
of
seven
events
in
a
rodeo
for
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
it
has
also
been
a
spectator
sport
on
its
own
riders
tour
america's
cities
as
well
as
brazil
mexico
australia
and
canada
they
drew
big
crowds
to
shows
at
madison
square
garden
in
new
york
and
at
a
large
arena
in
chicago
in
january
a
million
television
viewers
also
tune
in
to
see
constant
sorrow
lethal
larry
and
other
taurines
send
riders
such
as
jess
lockwood
or
chase
outlaw
into
the
dirt
the
sport
is
absurdly
dangerous
despite
the
protective
gear
most
riders
wear
mason
lowe
a
rider
at
a
professional
bull
riding
pbr
event
in
denver
was
stamped
on
and
killed
on
january
th
yet
the
shows
go
on
researchers
say
injuries
occur
for
every
exposure
hours
a
rate
times
riskier
than
boxing
and
times
worse
than
in
american
football
last
july
mr
outlaw
broke
bones
in
his
face
in
one
ride
at
least
three
riders
were
killed
last
year
what's
the
appeal
riders
boast
of
thrills
money
and
fame
mr
lockwood
and
already
a
former
world
champion
won
this
month's
events
in
new
york
and
chicago
rather
shy
he
says
he
likes
the
adrenalin
rush
and
has
ridden
since
he
was
three
the
most
successful
earn
m
a
season
though
most
get
far
less
for
the
crowd
it
is
the
spectacle
olvia
alstadt
originally
from
puerto
rico
was
at
the
chicago
event
with
her
toddler
daughter
i'm
a
liberal
arts
professor
but
my
husband's
family
is
from
texas
and
they
like
to
come
she
says
nelson
willis
who
has
brought
his
grand-daughter
for
the
past
eight
years
relishes
the
combination
of
danger
and
family
fun
it
is
a
tough
life
exciting
he
says
sean
gleason
who
runs
pbr
estimates
that
half
of
any
crowd
at
a
big
event
like
chicago's
is
well
versed
in
the
riders
skills
even
if
many
also
want
to
see
the
wreck
the
guy
flying
through
the
air
many
of
his
viewers
he
thinks
also
enjoy
the
thrill
and
crashes
of
nascar
racing
is
his
sport
thus
an
extreme
case
of
the
toxic
masculinity
which
the
american
psychological
association
warns
can
harm
the
mental
and
physical
health
of
boys
and
men
we
are
masculinity
on
steroids
he
says
with
a
chuckle
if
you
think
that's
a
problem
then
don't
buy
a
ticket
we
are
tough
guys
riding
bulls
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
