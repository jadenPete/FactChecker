her
time
as
a
black

year-old
major-general
laura
yeager
assumed
command
of
the
division
she
is
the
first
female
leader
of
an
infantry
division
in
american
history
major-generals
who
sport
two
stars
on
their
uniform
typically
command
over
soldiers
general
yeager's
division
is
made
up
of
four
brigade
combat
teams
usually
over
strong
spread
across
western
states
and
pacific
territories
much
of
her
time
will
be
spent
managing
a
sprawling
network
of
bases
and
facilities
when
she
joined
the
armed
forces
in
the
s
first
applying
to
the
reserve
officers
training
corps
programme
for
college
students
at
the
los
alamitos
training
base
she
now
leads
women
were
not
allowed
to
drive
tanks
join
certain
special
operations
units
or
serve
in
any
combat
capacity
including
infantry
which
generally
engages
the
enemy
at
closer
range
than
artillery
and
tanks
in
a
study
by
the
rand
corporation
a
think-tank
with
close
ties
to
america's
armed
forces
found
that
the
integration
of
women
into
the
armed
forces
did
not
degrade
readiness
cohesion
and
morale
despite
dire
warnings
that
all
three
would
suffer
yet
progress
was
slow
until
canada
was
the
only
nato
country
which
accepted
women
into
combat
arms
in
the
obama
administration
eventually
followed
suit
in
january
the
pentagon
threw
open
all
military
positions
to
women
women
could
be
generals
and
admirals
and
do
all
sorts
of
things
but
until
the
removal
of
restrictions
on
women
in
combat
there
was
still
this
secluded
part
of
the
military
that
women
couldn't
enter
says
kara
dixon
vuic
of
texas
christian
university
it's
been
the
last
brass
ceiling
so
it
is
a
big
deal
that
a
woman
is
now
in
charge
of
an
infantry
division
according
to
the
centre
for
naval
analyses
cna
a
think-tank
the
share
of
women
serving
across
the
armed
services
rose
from
in
when
america
moved
from
conscription
to
an
all-volunteer
force
to
in
among
commissioned
officers
who
manage
enlisted
personnel
and
from
to
among
enlisted
members
speaking
at
the
division's
headquarters
a
few
days
before
she
took
command
general
yeager
who
is
amiable
but
direct
added
as
far
as
i'm
aware
there's
no
other
occupation
where
you
know
you're
going
to
make
exactly
the
same
amount
of
money
as
the
male
doing
the
work
that
you're
doing
and
i
didn't
have
to
negotiate
that
it's
just
part
of
the
plan
though
she
is
heartened
by
the
increasing
number
of
women
joining
military
ranks
she
says
she
is
keen
for
the
trend
to
continue
until
the
armed
forces
more
closely
resemble
the
country
they
serve
that
will
take
time
the
army
and
marine
corps
adopted
a
leaders
first
policy
in
prioritising
recruiting
female
officers
ahead
of
female
enlisted
personnel
with
the
intention
of
building
a
cadre
of
female
leaders
that
process
was
expected
to
take
two
decades
notes
monica
medina
of

university
although
over
women
now
hold
jobs
previously
closed
to
them
the
army
has
more
than
a
million
soldiers
tests
conducted
by
britain's
defence
ministry
suggested
that
only
of
serving
women
there
could
pass
physical
tests
for
service
in
the
infantry
even
so
having
witnessed
ms
yeager
make
history
on
a
sunny
saturday
morning
captain
gerrelaine
alcordo
a
year-old
who
works
in
public
affairs
for
the
th
infantry
division
was
overflowing
with
optimism
as
politicians
and
uniformed
men
and
women
milled
about
the
base
she
exclaimed
now
little
girls
can
say
oh
my
god
i
can
do
that
if
i
had
a
daughter
and
she
was
here
i
would
be
like
you
can
do
that
you
can
be
in
the
infantry
you
can
go
into
combat
roles
and
be
powerful
