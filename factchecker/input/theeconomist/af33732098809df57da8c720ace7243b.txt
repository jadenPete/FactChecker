the
federal
government
backtracks
on
mercury-emissions
rules
not
even
the
operators
of
power
stations
seem
to
want
the
epa's
latest
edict
children
fear
lumps
of
coal
during
christmas
the
adults
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
had
no
such
reservations
on
december
th
despite
general
merriment
and
a
government
shutdown
the
agency
issued
its
finding
that
obama-era
regulations
on
mercury
emissions
from
coal-fired
power
plants
were
no
longer
appropriate
and
necessary
it
is
the
latest
in
a
long
series
of
deregulatory
actions
taken
by
the
trump
administration
in
an
effort
to
resuscitate
the
limping
coal
industry
in
this
case
the
timing
was
off
since
barack
obama's
epa
implemented
the
rule
in
coal
plants
have
already
spent
billions
in
compliance
costs
mercury
emissions
have
since
fallen
by
nearly
the
money
cannot
be
unspent
and
many
utility
operators
have
written
to
the
epa
asking
for
the
rules
to
be
left
in
place
removing
the
mercury
rule
is
however
an
id
e
fixe
of
bob
murray
a
coal
baron
with
the
president's
ear
for
whom
andrew
wheeler
the
acting
administrator
of
the
epa
once
worked
as
both
a
lawyer
and
lobbyist
the
battle
is
being
waged
over
regulatory
maths
the
costs
of
mercury
pollution
are
hard
to
price
because
it
is
difficult
to
put
a
figure
on
the
cognitive
impairment
of
children
and
fetuses
due
to
mercury
contamination
conservative
estimates
put
them
at
just
m
per
year
the
compliance
costs
for
industry
however
run
into
the
billions
so
how
did
obama-era
epa
justify
its
regulation
it
noted
that
the
plan
for
cutting
mercury
emissions
would
also
reduce
power-plant
emissions
of
fine
particulate
matter
by
across
the
country
this
stuff
which
can
become
lodged
in
the
lungs
causes
respiratory
disease
and
premature
death
these
so-called
co-benefits
were
several
times
larger
than
the
costs
preventing
up
to
premature
deaths
each
year
the
obama-era
rule
also
affects
emissions
of
odd
acid
gases
and
heavy
metals
mr
wheeler's
epa
does
not
deny
the
benefits
of
reducing
these
it
simply
maintains
that
they
should
not
be
considered
when
costing
the
rule
it's
like
we
pretend
they're
not
there
but
how
we
can
pretend
that
arsenic
beryllium
and
cancer-causing
chromium
doesn't
exist
is
beyond
me
says
ann
weeks
senior
counsel
at
the
clean
air
task
force
an
environmental
group
more
recent
scientific
estimates
suggest
that
even
the
direct
effect
of
mercury
pollution
is
much
greater
than
reported
in
the
epa's
original
analysis
perhaps
as
high
as
bn
per
year
this
is
based
on
better
evidence
of
the
effects
of
low-level
mercury
toxicity
on
intelligence
and
earnings
despite
the
new
estimates
the
agency
is
sticking
to
the
older
much
smaller
number
mr
wheeler's
reasoning
could
be
vulnerable
to
an
inevitable
court
challenge
which
would
span
years
for
his
former
law-firm
colleagues
all
those
billable
hours
could
prove
a
fine
christmas
present
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
