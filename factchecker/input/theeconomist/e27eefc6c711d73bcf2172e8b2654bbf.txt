america's
most
interesting
sheriff
tom
dart
has
reimagined
what
a
sheriff
can
be
when
it
comes
to
the
treatment
of
mentally
ill
people
says
tom
dart
in
future
people
will
look
back
and
call
us
evil
mr
dart
who
serves
cook
county
in
illinois
may
be
the
most
interesting
sheriff
in
the
country
america
locks
up
the
mentally
frail
out
of
indifference
he
says
behind
bars
with
few
officers
trained
to
help
the
sick
grow
more
troubled
and
likely
to
reoffend
in
chicago
rahm
emanuel
the
previous
mayor
closed
six
of
public-health
clinics
in
sheriff
dart
thinks
that
resulted
in
more
ill
people
losing
their
way
going
off
medication
getting
arrested
and
being
dumped
in
his
gargantuan
crumbling
jail
on
the
city's
south
side
his
staff
say
that
of
nearly
people
who
pass
through
yearly
as
of
mid-july
suffer
some
form
of
mental
ailment
early
in
his
term
he
was
first
elected
in
the
sheriff
a
former
illinois
lawmaker
tried
raising
awareness
he
calls
the
neglect
of
mental
health
chronic
inhumane
and
costly
imagine
if
we
treated
diabetes
by
locking
sufferers
in
a
small
room
he
says
but
as
alisa
roth
writes
in
insane
published
last
year
the
prison
system
has
been
known
as
a
warehouse
for
the
mentally
ill
for
decades
she
cites
a
federal
study
that
suggests
of
female
detainees
suffer
mental
illness
the
sheriff's
response
has
been
to
try
making
his
jail
the
best
mental-health
hospital
possible
he
has
done
away
with
solitary
confinement
a
practice
which
has
long
been
known
to
cause
and
worsen
mental
woes
doing
so
has
also
cut
staff
assaults
he
says
he
appointed
psychologists
as
jail
directors
and
hired
medically
trained
staff
in
place
of
some
guards
inmates
can
take
courses
in
yoga
chess
and
other
activities
intended
to
rehabilitate
spend
a
day
in
his
jail
and
much
appears
unusual
for
a
place
of
detention
in
a
damp
and
gloomy
basement
prison
workers
hand
out
questionnaires
to
men
arrested
the
night
before
they
scramble
to
see
inmates
before
they
go
before
a
bail
judge
who
will
release
most
the
same
day
to
get
a
chance
to
diagnose
the
mentally
ill
see
who
gets
treatment
and
offer
care
for
those
kept
inside
the
jail
holds
some
detainees
at
a
time
many
for
three-to-six
months
further
diagnosis
and
treatment
follows
staff
in
a
beige
hospital
building
distinguish
between
inmates
currently
who
are
higher-functioning
for
example
with
depression
of
marginal
stability
perhaps
with
schizophrenia
and
who
suffer
the
most
acute
psychosis
the
last
are
the
hardest
to
manage
let
alone
release
safely
treatment
includes
antidepressants
and
other
medical
care
getting
sober
and
counselling
to
address
low
self-esteem
we
diagnose
prescribe
and
treat
offer
therapeutic
classes
hotlines
for
families
and
have
a
discharge
plan
like
a
hospital
says
mr
dart
in
one
cell
block
a
psychiatrist
leads
women
in
blue
jail
smocks
in
a
lively
if
scripted
discussion
of
how
to
seek
self-forgiveness
the
women
read
poetry
talk
of
betrayal
and
of
shaking
off
addiction
over
half
are
hooked
on
heroin
says
an
official
a
gaunt
detainee
tells
how
she
struggles
with
anger
but
i
don't
think
i'm
the
same
person
as
when
i
came
in
i
used
to
lash
out
at
every
little
thing
therapy
sessions
for
male
detainees
bring
forth
stories
of
isolation
absent
parents
addiction
violence
fear
and
arrests
a
year-old
jesus
saenz
says
he
has
been
to
the
county
jail
times
he
laments
years
lost
to
cocaine
and
pcp
gangs
depression
and
bi-polar
disorder
after
medical
care
and
months
of
counselling
he
now
vows
to
stay
clean
and
get
a
job
they
helped
me
stop
my
bullshit
hurting
other
people
he
says
what
chance
does
mr
dart
have
of
succeeding
some
anecdotes
are
cheering
but
measurement
is
tricky
beyond
looking
at
rates
of
rearrests
reoffending
in
the
first
ten
days
of
release
is
down
sharply
says
the
sheriff
a
pilot
project
gives
the
most
vulnerable
help
to
find
housing
food
and
clothing
on
release
some
are
driven
home
not
just
dumped
outside
the
jailhouse
door
but
longer-term
rates
of
rearrest
are
not
yet
noticeably
down
he
concedes
the
jail
population
has
shrunk
by
half
since
sheriff
dart
came
in
that
is
explained
by
many
things
including
generally
lower
rates
of
arrest
by
police
in
the
past
three
years
bond
reform
passed
in
is
also
a
factor
bail
is
rarely
set
at
thousands
of
dollars
so
fewer
are
jailed
merely
for
being
poor
this
has
freed
up
resources
for
better
health
care
as
did
closing
a
military-style
boot
camp
in
the
jail
mr
dart
is
convinced
data
will
eventually
show
overall
benefits
once
experts
from
the
university
of
chicago
and
elsewhere
have
had
time
to
track
outcomes
beyond
the
jail
walls
he
is
trying
other
experiments
rethinking
the
role
of
the
sheriff's
office
and
deploying
his
nearly
staff
in
ways
his
predecessors
never
imagined
there
are
over
sheriffs
across
america
law
officers
whose
duties
are
limited
mostly
to
policing
and
enforcing
court
orders
under
mr
dart's
expansive
view
the
office
can
be
a
form
of
alternative
government
his
mandate
is
so
nebulous
he
argues
it
amounts
to
outrageously
broad
powers
for
a
willing
sheriff
especially
beyond
city
borders
his
county
includes
towns
and
villages
outside
chicago
he
tries
what
he
calls
wildly
different
stuff
to
make
my
job
more
bizarre
examples
include
his
office
helping
the
mayor
of
a
depopulated
crime-ridden
and
poor
town
ford
heights
to
fix
its
public
lighting
and
water
build
a
baseball
diamond
and
replace
a
defunct
police
force
elsewhere
he
has
clashed
with
banks
by
refusing
to
evict
homeowners
who
are
behind
on
mortgages
he
resisted
even
facing
threats
of
contempt
orders
against
him
personally
he
called
the
evictions
unjust
for
a
thoughtful
society
mr
dart
campaigned
to
close
backpage
com
a
website
shuttered
by
federal
authorities
for
hosting
adverts
for
human
trafficking
and
prostitution
and
in
chicago
he
deployed
officers
to
promote
community
policing
to
build
trust
among
residents
in
especially
violent
areas
even
when
city
police
at
first
seemed
reluctant
to
accept
help
not
all
these
efforts
succeed
but
through
his
willingness
to
try
new
things
until
someone
stops
him
and
his
enthusiasm
for
clashing
with
democratic
power-brokers
in
springfield
like
the
house
speaker
mike
madigan
mr
dart
has
reimagined
what
a
sheriff
can
be
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
