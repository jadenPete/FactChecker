donald
trump
risks
undoing
decades
of
nuclear
arms
control
his
foray
into
north
korea
belies
the
gamble
he
is
taking
with
russia
on
june
th
when
president
donald
trump
took
a
few
paces
inside
north
korean
territory
with
kim
jong
un
at
panmunjom
the
symbolism
suggested
a
determined
new
push
towards
easing
nuclear
tensions
talks
between
america
and
north
korea
stalled
since
an
unsuccessful
summit
in
hanoi
in
february
were
due
to
resume
in
berlin
this
week
away
from
the
world's
cameras
however
the
broader
picture
on
nuclear
arms
control
looks
very
different
things
are
heading
not
forwards
but
backwards
at
an
accelerating
rate
after
the
cuban
missile
crisis
in
took
america
and
the
soviet
union
to
the
brink
they
grew
serious
about
nuclear
negotiations
in
they
signed
an
agreement
capping
the
number
of
each
other's
strategic
delivery
systems
and
a
treaty
to
limit
defences
against
ballistic
missiles
over
the
next
four
decades
they
mustered
seven
other
big
nuclear
deals
their
combined
destructive
potential
dropped
from
the
equivalent
of
m
hiroshima
bombs
in
to
about
hiroshimas
now
less
obscene
if
still
horrendous
yet
nuclear
deals
are
now
unravelling
mr
trump
pulled
america
out
of
the
multiparty
one
with
iran
known
as
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
jcpoa
hoping
to
press
that
country
into
a
bigger
better
accord
but
so
far
producing
only
heightened
tensions
iran
has
now
breached
the
deal's
limit
for
stockpiles
of
low-enriched
uranium
and
gone
above
the
level
of
enrichment
allowed
last
october
mr
trump
abruptly
declared
that
america
would
withdraw
from
the
treaty
on
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
inf
citing
russia's
violation
of
its
ban
on
ground-launched
missiles
with
a
range
of
km
miles
the
treaty
signed
by
ronald
reagan
and
mikhail
gorbachev
in
is
set
to
expire
on
august
nd
its
demise
could
open
the
way
for
a
new
arms
race
in
missiles
whether
nuclear
or
conventional
whose
time
to
target
is
mere
minutes
that
still
leaves
in
place
one
big
nuclear
treaty
between
america
and
russia
new
start
signed
by
presidents
barack
obama
and
dmitry
medvedev
in
it
limits
each
country
to
deployed
nuclear
warheads
across
delivery
systems
its
verification
regime
includes
on-site
inspections
each
year
and
copious
data
exchanges
but
new
start
will
lapse
in
months
time
unless
both
countries
agree
to
a
five-year
extension
which
their
leaders
can
do
without
congressional
approval
the
prospects
are
not
good
russia
is
keen
america
appears
not
to
be
there's
no
decision
mr
trump's
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
told
free
beacon
a
website
last
month
but
i
think
it's
unlikely
for
an
extension
to
be
agreed
upon
some
differences
would
have
to
be
settled
the
americans
worry
about
russia's
plans
for
new
weapons
such
as
the
avangard
hypersonic
boost-glide
system
the
russians
have
concerns
over
the
way
the
americans
got
within
start's
limits
converting
nuclear
delivery
systems
into
conventional
ones
rather
than
destroying
them
president
vladimir
putin
bemoans
the
absence
of
practical
moves
from
the
americans
despite
mr
trump's
earlier
expressions
of
interest
talks
need
to
start
now
mr
putin
told
the
financial
times
last
month
to
settle
matters
in
time
if
the
treaty
ceases
to
exist
he
said
there
would
be
no
instrument
in
the
world
to
curtail
the
arms
race
worse
each
side
would
be
left
blind
without
a
start
extension
america
and
russia
will
be
without
on-the-ground
insight
into
each
other's
nuclear
forces
for
the
first
time
in
about
years
which
is
incredibly
dangerous
says
alexandra
bell
of
the
centre
for
arms
control
and
non-proliferation
a
think-tank
the
verification
regime
enables
policymakers
to
plan
with
confidence
a
former
official
involved
in
negotiating
the
treaty
says
it
would
cost
multiple
billions
of
dollars
per
year
to
gather
the
intelligence
by
other
means
why
would
mr
trump
give
this
up
it
is
not
for
lack
of
interest
in
arms
control
as
far
back
as
he
is
said
to
have
wanted
to
ask
reagan
to
let
him
negotiate
a
nuclear
deal
and
quickly
end
the
cold
war
now
he
sees
an
obama
accord
and
believes
he
can
do
better
he
envisages
not
just
a
bilateral
deal
with
russia
but
a
broader
one
involving
china
and
perhaps
others
embracing
all
weapons
systems
he
has
asked
his
administration
to
explore
this
in
theory
this
makes
sense
bilateral
nuclear
deals
had
a
logic
during
the
cold
war
but
mr
bolton
has
argued
that
in
today's
multipolar
nuclear
world
that
is
conceptually
completely
backward
american
officials
expect
china's
arsenal
to
double
over
the
next
decade
arms-control
advocates
agree
that
hypersonic
weapons
and
cyber
capabilities
pose
new
threats
we're
facing
an
international
security
crisis
in
the
arms-control
arena
as
technologies
are
outpacing
the
diplomatic
and
legal
frameworks
that
in
the
past
served
us
well
in
nuclear
and
chemical
and
biological
weapons
says
daryl
kimball
director
of
the
arms
control
association
in
washington
dc
in
practice
though
mr
trump's
approach
looks
hopeless
for
one
thing
china
shows
no
interest
in
it
it
has
a
nuclear
arsenal
of
only
warheads
compared
with
america's
and
russia's
according
to
the
stockholm
international
peace
research
institute
it
sees
no
reason
to
submit
to
limits
just
yet
and
if
numbers
fell
much
more
russia
would
want
french
and
british
weapons
included
in
the
mix
arms-control
experts
doubt
that
the
trump
administration
has
the
bandwidth
to
conduct
serious
negotiations
with
the
russians
chinese
and
north
koreans
at
the
same
time
the
state
department
office
responsible
for
handling
nuclear
disarmament
has
shrunk
from
people
to
four
during
mr
trump's
presidency
the
guardian
recently
reported
they
detect
no
strategy
for
conducting
such
a
complex
negotiation
besides
they
view
mr
bolton
as
a
wily
operator
who
hates
arms
control
which
he
sees
as
constraining
america
under
george
w.
bush
in
he
helped
to
pull
america
out
of
the
anti-ballistic
missile
treaty
in
his
current
role
he
has
seen
off
the
iran
deal
and
the
inf
treaty
the
suspicion
is
that
he
is
using
the
idea
of
a
bigger
deal
as
a
diversion
to
kill
new
start
some
would
like
to
see
new
start
extended
first
thus
retaining
its
precious
verification
provisions
before
moving
on
to
a
broader
arms-control
effort
which
could
take
years
they
believe
both
sides
concerns
over
an
extension
could
be
quickly
sorted
out
if
there
was
clear
political
direction
from
the
top
on
that
mr
bolton
agrees
if
you
really
want
to
negotiate
you
can
do
it
fast
he
told
free
beacon
pressure
is
starting
to
come
from
congress
in
may
leaders
of
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
introduced
a
bipartisan
bill
urging
the
trump
administration
to
retain
the
limits
on
russia's
nuclear
forces
until
mr
trump
could
yet
find
himself
vulnerable
to
attack
on
the
nuclear
issue
by
democratic
candidates
for
his
job
he
also
risks
a
rough
ride
at
the
five-yearly
review
conference
next
spring
of
the
nuclear
non-proliferation
treaty
npt
it
will
be
an
acrimonious
affair
if
the
nuclear
powers
are
not
seen
to
be
doing
their
bit
to
contain
the
spread
of
weapons
there
is
already
a
deep
split
over
the
treaty
on
the
prohibition
of
nuclear
weapons
approved
by
the
un
general
assembly
in
which
seeks
to
delegitimise
nukes
if
the
united
states
and
russia
can't
show
up
in
and
at
least
say
we've
extended
new
start
and
hopefully
say
we've
extended
and
are
engaged
in
further
discussion
we're
going
to
be
in
bad
shape
says
lynn
rusten
of
the
nuclear
threat
initiative
an
advocacy
group
in
washington
dc
erosion
of
the
npt
could
give
more
countries
an
excuse
to
join
the
nuclear
club
the
number
of
nukes
in
the
world
has
come
down
but
could
swell
again
in
the
absence
of
controls
or
trust
alexey
arbatov
from
the
institute
of
world
economy
and
international
relations
in
moscow
bemoans
a
lack
of
understanding
of
the
history
of
nuclear
arms
control
among
the
world's
leaders
today
that
could
result
in
miscalculation
saving
the
inf
treaty
and
start
while
there
is
still
time
would
be
much
easier
and
more
productive
than
searching
for
palliatives
after
their
demise
he
concludes
in
the
current
issue
of
survival
the
journal
of
the
international
institute
for
strategic
studies
time
though
is
running
out
finding
a
way
to
re-engage
with
russia
before
it
is
too
late
will
not
be
easy
but
it
would
probably
matter
more
than
those
steps
across
the
border
at
panmunjom
china's

growing
up
europe's

no
