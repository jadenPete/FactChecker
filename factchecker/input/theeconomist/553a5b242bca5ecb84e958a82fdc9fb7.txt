the
island's
governor
announced
his
resignation
on
july
th
wanda
v
zquez
the
justice
secretary
was
theoretically
next
in
line
though
she
says
she
does
not
want
the
job
then
on
july
st
mr
rossell
nominated
pedro
pierluisi
who
lost
to
him
in
the
primaries
to
replace
him
as
the
economist
went
to
press
on
august
st
mr
pierluisi's
nomination
process
was
just
starting
and
seemed
sure
to
be
contested
in
the
legislature
it
was
unclear
who
will
actually
sit
in
the
governor's
mansion
next
mr
rossell
s
resignation
which
came
after
weeks
of
protests
sparked
by
the
leaking
of
text
messages
in
which
he
mocked
his
constituents
has
pushed
america's
biggest
territory
into
a
succession
crisis
removing
mr
rossell
was
cathartic
but
puerto
rico
has
deeper
problems
it
has
suffered
from
years
of
economic
mismanagement
a
bloated
public
sector
and
high
levels
of
poverty
the
island
has
long
failed
to
capitalise
on
its
many
assets
from
its
natural
beauty
to
the
artistic
creativity
of
its
people
which
was
on
display
in
the
placards
costumes
and
music
of
the
protests
hurricane
maria
which
hit
in
made
things
worse
sparking
mass
emigration
to
the
united
states
mainland
the
government
debt
which
exceeds
bn
including
pension
liabilities
is
suffocating
the
washington-appointed
oversight
board
has
completed
two
deals
to
restructure
some
of
the
debt
this
year
mr
rossell
s
departure
has
focused
attention
on
one
of
puerto
rico's
most
significant
problems
fuelled
by
two-party
machine
politics
corruption
has
been
endemic
for
generations
politicians
on
both
sides
offer
sweetheart
deals
to
their
friends
in
business
which
in
turn
generates
the
money
needed
to
get
elected
the
political
system
basically
created
an
institutional
infrastructure
that
promotes
behaviour
which
will
lead
to
corruption
sooner
or
later
explains
jos
villamil
an
economist
on
july
th
the
fbi
arrested
six
individuals
including
two
members
of
the
administration
for
directing
m
to
favoured
businessmen
douglas
leff
head
of
the
san
juan
division
of
the
fbi
told
radio
isla
it's
going
to
be
a
very
busy
summer
for
us
a
week
later
the
centre
of
investigative
journalism
cpi
from
its
spanish
initials
which
originally
published
the
leaked
messages
that
led
to
the
governor's
downfall
reported
that
three
of
his
associates
el
as
s
nchez
carlos
berm
dez
and
edwin
miranda
had
benefited
in
various
ways
from
their
friendship
with
mr
rossell
all
three
deny
wrongdoing
if
mr
pierluisi's
appointment
is
blocked
finding
a
better
replacement
for
mr
rossell
could
be
hard
few
prominent
politicians
are
free
from
accusations
of
corruption
it
is
not
just
ms
v
zquez
who
does
not
want
the
job
of
being
governor
several
others
have
ruled
themselves
out
until
puerto
rico
holds
elections
in
taking
the
job
is
political
suicide
says
carla
minet
the
chief
editor
of
the
cpi
whoever
becomes
governor
they
will
need
to
work
to
dismantle
the
system
of
patronage
that
has
built
up
over
years
apart
from
the
practice
of
favouring
allies
with
government
contracts
politicians
have
a
habit
of
replacing
officials
across
the
government
machinery
with
their
own
cronies
every
time
there
is
a
transfer
of
power
that
means
a
loss
of
expertise
each
time
the
new
governor
will
not
find
things
easy
reform
is
not
always
popular
especially
in
the
public
sector
which
is
a
sore
point
for
many
puerto
ricans
the
protests
that
helped
push
out
mr
rossell
could
easily
restart
traditionally
puerto
rico's
people
have
split
between
those
who
support
statehood
and
those
who
are
happy
to
see
it
remain
a
commonwealth
under
american
jurisdiction
but
with
no
vote
in
congress
but
anger
with
the
government
has
unified
both
sides
for
now
the
mood
on
the
island
is
elation
people
are
not
sleeping
any
more
says
gerardo
alvarado
le
n
a
reporter
for
el
nuevo
d
a
a
newspaper
fresh
from
his
first
solid
night's
sleep
in
weeks
but
when
the
buzz
fades
puerto
ricans
will
need
to
find
other
ways
to
keep
up
the
pressure
ending
graft
will
require
deep
civic
engagement
the
creativity
shown
in
the
protests
will
go
far
after
years
of
tolerating
corruption
puerto
ricans
have
decided
they
will
no
longer
put
up
with
it
they
need
a
leadership
which
agrees
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
