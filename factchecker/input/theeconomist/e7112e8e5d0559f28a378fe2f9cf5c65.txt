an

the
benefits
of

kathleen
merchant
was
already
on
probation
when
she
got
into
an
argument
with
her
room-mate
who
called
the
indianapolis
police
ms
merchant
was
taken
to
jail
where
she
languished
for
three
weeks
because
she
neither
had
nor
knew
anyone
with
for
her
bond
eventually
the
bail
project
a
national
non-profit
that
pays
people's
bail
came
to
her
rescue
but
as
a
condition
of
her
release
she
had
to
wear
an
ankle
monitor
in
this
marion
county
where
indianapolis
sits
behaves
like
many
other
counties
it
charges
those
who
wear
monitors
for
the
privilege
ms
merchant
paid
per
day
plus
a
activation
fee
this
is
a
hefty
burden
for
someone
like
ms
merchant
who
has
neither
a
job
nor
a
stable
home
her
lawyer
warned
that
if
she
objected
to
the
fee
she
would
be
sent
back
to
jail
so
she
kept
quiet
but
as
she
notes
just
because
you
say
i
have
to
pay
doesn't
make
me
have
ms
merchant's
story
is
not
unusual
electronic
monitoring
em
is
increasingly
seen
as
an
alternative
to
cash
bail
which
has
come
under
fire
recently
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
political
and
legal
winds
are
shifting
against
keeping
people
locked
up
simply
because
they
cannot
come
up
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
for
bail
second
because
bail
keeps
jails
overcrowded
whereas
em
lets
people
await
trial
at
home
most
places
that
use
em
charge
for
it
just
as
many
jurisdictions
charge
inmates
for
their
own
imprisonment
but
as
jurisdictions
reject
one
type
of
injustice
they
risk
instituting
another
em
tends
to
come
with
high
fees
and
at
times
impossible
conditions
the
fees
vary
by
jurisdiction
and
even
by
judge
finding
comprehensive
national
data
is
all
but
impossible
some
in
marion
county
which
a
number
of
experts
say
has
america's
highest
rates
of
em
use
pay
more
than
ms
merchant
though
fees
are
capped
at
an
hour
others
pay
less
if
they
can
convince
a
judge
that
they
are
poor
or
if
they
successfully
complete
what
ms
merchant
and
others
familiar
with
the
system
describe
as
a
burdensome
and
confusing
financial
application
for
relief
john
a
defendant
in
louisiana
says
he
paid
a
month
for
his
monitor
as
well
as
to
repay
the
loan
for
his
bail
officials
often
maintain
that
the
fees
are
intended
to
cover
costs
but
sometimes
they
exceed
them
the
sheriff
of
kane
county
illinois
told
a
local
newspaper
that
monitoring
costs
a
day
even
though
wearers
are
charged
conditions
also
vary
the
cook
county
sheriff's
office
says
that
wearers
are
often
granted
permission
to
work
or
attend
college
but
sharlyn
grace
director
of
the
chicago
community
bond
fund
says
that
though
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
get
permission
in
reality
it's
hard
to
obtain
and
although
granting
permission
for
regular
working
hours
is
easy
enough
many
low-wage
jobs
have
schedules
that
vary
often
with
little
notice
wearers
who
go
to
work
without
that
permission
could
be
returned
to
jail
monitors
are
gps-tagged
and
sound
an
alarm
when
the
wearer
is
not
where
he
is
supposed
to
be
john
says
he
was
fired
because
his
curfew
prevented
him
from
working
when
he
was
needed
then
there
are
child-care
emergencies
groceries
to
buy
and
errands
to
run
alarms
also
sound
when
a
device's
batteries
run
down
or
when
the
signal
is
lost
ms
merchant
said
she
was
on
an
unexpectedly
long
bus
ride
from
a
job
interview
when
her
device
began
beeping
she
was
reduced
to
pleading
with
businesses
to
let
her
plug
herself
into
the
wall
for
two
hours
to
recharge
her
monitor
trailers
metal
walls
can
block
the
signal
triggering
an
alert
in
these
situations
wearers
must
plead
their
cases
to
police
whose
disbelief
can
return
them
to
jail
em's
defenders
argue
correctly
that
remaining
at
home
with
an
ankle
monitor
is
better
than
going
to
jail
but
that
is
a
low
bar
to
clear
like
jail
which
charges
inmates
exorbitant
fees
for
essentials

stigmatises
people

when
people
see
someone
with
an
ankle
monitor
they
do
not

there's
an
innocent
person
they
wonder
what
that
person
did
and
the
burdens

stigma
imposes

why
