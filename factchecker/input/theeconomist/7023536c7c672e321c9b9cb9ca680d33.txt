how
many
civilians
does
america
kill
in
air
strikes
the
pentagon
does
not
really
know
america
has
conducted
air
strikes
in
somalia
since
killing
some
people
the
pentagon
says
they
were
all
jihadists
amnesty
international
a
human
rights
organisation
disagrees
it
has
gathered
detailed
evidence
suggesting
that
five
recent
strikes
alone
killed
civilians
that
discrepancy
between
the
civilians
that
external
observers
say
have
been
killed
in
american
air
strikes
and
the
number
the
government
owns
up
to
is
repeated
across
the
world
donald
trump
came
to
office
pledging
to
wind
down
america's
wars
instead
he
ramped
some
of
them
up
the
campaign
in
somalia
against
al-shabab
a
brutal
jihadist
group
which
is
aligned
to
al-qaeda
and
controls
a
quarter
of
the
country
saw
the
number
of
air
strikes
trebled
from
in
to
last
year
there
were
in
the
first
three
months
of
alone
in
part
that
may
reflect
looser
rules
barack
obama
had
decreed
that
commanders
in
places
like
somalia
and
pakistan
outside
of
formal
war
zones
like
iraq
required
near
certainty
that
a
target
was
a
high-value
terrorist
no
civilians
would
be
killed
or
injured
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances
and
decisions
would
be
informed
by
inter-agency
consultation
in
mr
trump
overhauled
these
rules
he
not
only
diluted
mr
obama's
special
restrictions
on
secret
wars
but
also
allowed
specific
countries
to
be
declared
an
area
of
active
hostilities
in
such
places
international
humanitarian
law
ihl
the
more
permissive
rules
that
apply
in
avowed
battlefields
like
iraq
and
afghanistan
would
be
in
force
in
somalia
this
meant
commanders
now
needed
only
reasonable
certainty
that
a
target
was
present
and
could
make
their
decision
without
recourse
to
officials
back
home
this
increased
the
risk
of
civilians
being
misidentified
as
combatants
separately
the
shift
to
ihl
also
meant
that
commanders
could
go
after
foot-soldiers
not
just
al-shabab
bigwigs
disputes
over
the
civilian
toll
from
air
campaigns
go
well
beyond
somalia
more
american
bombs
and
missiles
fell
on
afghanistan
in
than
in
any
year
since
published
records
began
a
decade
ago
more
than
five
times
as
many
as
in
civilian
deaths
from
air
strikes
correspondingly
rose
by
between
and
to
according
to
action
on
armed
violence
aoav
a
monitoring
group
that
includes
bombs
dropped
by
the
afghan
air
force
which
has
far
less
experience
in
using
precision
weapons
but
the
united
nations
assistance
mission
in
afghanistan
unama
whose
estimates
are
similar
to
those
of
aoav
says
that
of
aerial
casualties
deaths
and
injuries
were
inflicted
by
the
nato-led
coalition
whose
air
power
is
largely
american
nato
accepts
just
of
those
deaths
a
small
proportion
of
unama's
total
though
it
agrees
that
another
are
disputed
a
similar
story
has
played
out
in
the
middle
east
by
march
the
american-led
coalition
battling
islamic
state
across
iraq
and
syria
had
owned
up
to
at
least
civilian
deaths
since
the
start
of
the
war
airwars
a
london-based
ngo
says
the
figure
is
probably
six
times
higher
over
an
average
of
one
civilian
death
every
four
strikes
airwars
is
particularly
scathing
of
britain's
claim
to
have
killed
just
one
civilian
among
or
so
enemies
britain
it
says
is
seemingly
incapable
of
detecting
civilian
casualties
from
its
urban
actions
this
uncertainty
stems
in
part
from
the
nature
of
modern
war
on
most
of
its
battlefields
small
bands
of
american
and
allied
special
forces
quietly
direct
air
strikes
using
laser
guidance
and
other
high-tech
methods
but
america
also
outsources
the
job
to
regional
allies
such
as
kurdish
rebels
in
syria
and
secret
paramilitary
units
made
up
of
afghans
many
of
these
local
proxies
can
call
in
air
strikes
but
they
have
neither
the
inclination
nor
the
expertise
to
conduct
detailed
investigations
of
the
aftermath
on
the
ground
that
leaves
america
reliant
on
overhead
imagery
coupled
with
what
limited
human
or
electronic
intelligence
may
trickle
in
to
count
bodies
this
is
particularly
limiting
when
it
comes
to
evaluating
casualties
inside
buildings
in
built-up
areas
in
some
cases
the
people
on
the
ground
whether
al-shabab
in
somalia
or
pakistan's
intelligence
agency
deliberately
obfuscate
matters
keeping
the
press
away
from
bombed
areas
but
america's
own
rules
also
appear
to
be
part
of
the
problem
american
commanders
evaluate
casualty
claims
made
by
external
organisations
in
inconsistent
and
sometimes
restrictive
ways
one
study
of
iraq
and
syria
by
azmat
khan
and
anand
gopal
for
the
new
york
times
in
found
that
armed
forces
would
entertain
allegations
only
within
metres
of
an
air
strike
considerably
narrower
than
the
blast
radius
of
some
american
weapons
in
other
cases
they
were
more
reasonable
considering
claims
within
several
miles
american
commanders
may
also
be
primed
to
underestimate
figures
larry
lewis
a
former
official
who
led
seven
pentagon
studies
on
how
to
avoid
civilian
casualties
in
afghanistan
points
out
that
america's
pre-strike
process
for
estimating
collateral
damage
though
rigorous
has
never
been
calibrated
with
real
world
data
to
test
its
accuracy
the
pentagon
has
taken
note
of
all
this
criticism
in
february
it
partially
declassified
a
study
from
of
civilian
casualties
caused
over
the
previous
three
years
the
study
insisted
that
there
was
a
widespread
priority
to
minimise
civilian
casualties
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
levels
but
found
that
the
coalition
against
islamic
state
had
systematically
undercounted
the
report
said
that
of
civilian
casualties
assessed
as
credible
came
from
external
allegations
not
internal
sources
in
fact
america's
armed
forces
often
turn
to
the
very
same
ngos
that
hold
their
feet
to
the
fire
on
these
matters
in
the
vast
majority
of
civilian
casualty
assessments
published
by
the
coalition
over
alleged
events
were
sourced
to
airwars
the
ngo
based
in
london
airwars
now
liaises
closely
with
american
forces
and
both
sides
swap
data
on
a
regular
basis
progressively
over
time
we've
seen
improvements
in
our
relationship
and
the
standard
of
their
assessments
and
ours
says
chris
woods
airwars
founder
and
director
the
pentagon's
study
exhorted
officials
to
build
on
efforts
like
these
it
urged
officials
to
systematically
seek
out
additional
sources
of
information
on
potential
civilian
casualties
including
social
media
and
ngos
it
proposed
that
commanders
around
the
world
should
take
on
staff
to
reconcile
the
pentagon's
claims
with
those
of
others
and
standardise
their
process
for
making
assessments
its
general
thrust
was
to
encourage
transparency
mr
woods
says
that
the
americans
have
been
pioneering
on
addressing
civilian
harm
way
ahead
of
europeans
that
he
suggests
is
the
result
of
pressure
from
legislation
and
bipartisan
interest
from
congress
on
may
st
the
pentagon
is
due
to
publish
a
congressionally
mandated
report
on
global
civilian
casualties
but
not
everyone
seems
on
board
on
march
th
mr
trump
revoked
an
executive
order
by
mr
obama
which
had
required
intelligence
officials
to
publish
civilian
casualties
in
undeclared
war
zones
like
pakistan
and
yemen
mostly
from
cia
drone
strikes
superfluous
reporting
requirements
said
the
national
security
council
distract
our
intelligence
professionals
from
their
primary
mission
in
contrast
to
the
pentagon's
recent
efforts
to
improve
transparency
the
white
house
decision
is
a
dismaying
step
backwards
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
