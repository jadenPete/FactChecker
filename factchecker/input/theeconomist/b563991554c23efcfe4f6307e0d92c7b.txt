the
arrival
of
foxconn
in
wisconsin
divides
democrats
a
whopping
subsidy
to
america's
biggest
foreign
investment
splits
the
party
along
class
lines
from
kim
and
jim
mahoney's
kitchen
the
view
is
spectacular
reeds
edge
their
garden
beyond
those
large
lorries
trundle
past
roughly
once
a
minute
each
leaves
its
load
on
an
immense
rising
pyramid
of
orange
sand
machinery
clanks
as
yellow
diggers
and
bulldozers
toil
a
white
factory
a
multipurpose
space
for
robot
assemblers
say
the
mahoneys
recently
rose
where
a
copse
once
stood
the
couple
had
expected
a
bucolic
life
after
finishing
their
house
two
years
ago
it
was
not
to
be
soon
afterwards
scott
walker
then
wisconsin's
governor
said
their
neighbourhood
would
be
handed
to
a
taiwanese
manufacturer
foxconn
is
building
a
huge
bn
manufacturing
plant
on
much
of
mount
pleasant
originally
at
least
it
promised
to
churn
out
large
latest
model
lcd
televisions
there
things
moved
fast
last
year
president
donald
trump
a
golden
shovel
in
hand
celebrated
the
deal
just
beyond
the
mahoneys
garden
declaring
the
plant
will
be
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
it
will
reportedly
be
america's
biggest
single
foreign
direct
investment
local
homeowners
protested
but
most
sold
up
the
mahoneys
and
their
dog
stubborn
sorts
still
cling
on
kim
mahoney
says
politicians
abandoned
them
in
a
rushed
murky
process
republicans
trumpeted
economic
benefits
especially
foxconn's
promise
of
jobs
paying
an
average
of
over
for
low-skilled
locals
such
as
those
in
the
nearby
depressed
city
of
racine
with
a
venture
fund
and
other
activities
foxconn
could
transform
a
run-down
industrial
region
in
southern
wisconsin
once
famed
for
making
horlicks
and
tractors
into
a
bustling
hub
for
startups
democrats
in
opposition
did
not
resist
much
some
harrumphed
about
dodgy
favours
for
the
taiwanese
such
as
the
easing
of
a
rule
that
limits
smog
foxconn
unusually
is
allowed
to
soak
up
lots
of
water
from
nearby
lake
michigan
bizarrely
because
of
a
special
law
in
effect
it
can
even
operate
above
some
courts
it
may
instantly
appeal
against
any
lower
court
ruling
that
is
not
in
its
favour
to
the
state
supreme
court
tony
evers
a
democrat
who
has
just
replaced
mr
walker
as
governor
is
no
firebrand
he
has
been
cautious
about
the
deal
lest
he
be
seen
as
opposing
decent
manufacturing
jobs
in
office
he
is
loth
to
scare
investors
by
breaking
his
predecessor's
legal
contract
urbane
educated
and
liberal
types
in
madison
the
state
capital
may
wring
their
hands
but
the
blue-collar
wing
of
his
party
especially
near
racine
is
keen
cory
mason
a
philosophical
type
who
was
elected
mayor
of
racine
in
is
an
avid
supporter
who
hopes
foxconn
will
revive
his
shrinking
city
as
a
state
legislator
he
was
one
of
three
democrats
who
backed
mr
walker's
deal
he
saw
a
breakdown
within
democratic
voters
as
class
lines
defined
views
in
the
party
those
with
factory
jobs
or
who
wanted
them
cheered
foxconn
those
with
a
college
education
opposed
it
he
says
greta
neubauer
another
democrat
a
state
legislator
and
a
fifth-generation
resident
of
racine
agrees
she
disliked
the
deal
but
she
says
as
this
is
happening
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
it
but
democrats
run
a
risk
in
doing
so
the
foxconn
deal
looks
financially
nonsensical
mr
walker
pressed
by
mr
trump
pledged
an
immense
pile
of
taxpayers
money
for
a
foreign
firm
tim
bartik
an
economist
at
the
upjohn
institute
for
employment
research
in
michigan
estimates
that
state
governments
typically
offer
big
investors
subsidies
worth
of
wages
over
years
in
luring
amazon
last
year
new
york
offered
virginia
just
for
example
foxconn's
deal
in
wisconsin
he
says
is
worth
ten
times
the
average
wisconsin
has
pledged
almost
bn
to
foxconn
a
sum
mr
bartik
says
is
impossible
to
rationalise
in
years
people
will
point
to
this
as
an
example
of
what
not
to
do
he
says
as
wisconsin
barely
taxes
manufacturers
the
help
will
come
as
relief
on
sales
tax
free
provision
of
land
and
direct
payments
the
effect
will
be
to
divert
about
m
annually
from
the
state
budget
for
many
years
to
come
mr
evers
has
promised
no
tax
rises
so
spending
such
as
on
education
or
health
may
have
to
drop
worse
foxconn
which
is
struggling
with
weak
global
sales
of
smartphones
is
backing
off
its
first
bold
promises
it
will
not
make
those
big
lcd
televisions
after
all
its
local
supply
chain
can
shrink
doing
without
glassmakers
instead
goods
will
be
shipped
in
and
assembled
no
one
is
yet
sure
what
will
be
made
perhaps
small
screens
for
phones
to
lower
costs
robots
will
do
many
tasks
so
fewer
low-skilled
folk
from
nearby
racine
will
be
needed
than
expected
locals
are
also
short
on
the
necessary
skills
mark
muro
at
brookings
a
think-tank
has
analysed
automation
and
the
availability
of
workers
he
says
the
racine
area
is
exceptionally
short
of
engineering
computing
or
maths
skills
instead
the
firm
will
look
far
and
wide
for
engineers
and
developers
foxconn
rejects
reports
that
engineers
will
come
from
china
but
a
person
well
informed
about
the
deal
says
a
few
hundred
chinese
workers
already
in
america
may
have
to
move
to
wisconsin
could
the
democrats
yet
back
away
matt
flynn
an
ex-chairman
of
wisconsin's
democratic
party
hopes
to
lead
a
private
legal
challenge
claiming
the
taiwanese
firm
enjoys
unconstitutional
favours
over
its
special
legal
arrangements
and
he
wants
mr
evers
to
see
if
foxconn
is
in
breach
of
contract
for
changing
its
plans
his
attempts
are
unlikely
to
stop
the
trucks
and
diggers
the
mahoneys
expect
legal
mediation
over
their
home
next
month
soon
they
will
have
no
kitchen

stand
in
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
