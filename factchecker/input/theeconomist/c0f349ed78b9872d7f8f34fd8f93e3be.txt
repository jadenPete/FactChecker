kamala
harris
is
doing
better
than
she
deserves
she
is
a
natural
centrist
why
not
say
so
one
of
the
reasons
maybe
the
biggest
reason
why
joe
biden
is
ruling
the
democratic
primary
field
is
an
apparent
paucity
of
convincing
alternatives
pete
buttigieg
is
dripping
with
talent
but
struggling
to
reach
beyond
the
liberal
msnbc
crowd
elizabeth
warren
is
an
intellectual
heavyweight
yet
making
little
headway
in
a
contest
that
seems
increasingly
defined
by
a
single
question
can
you
beat
donald
trump
in
that
tremulous
environment
the
reassuringly
experienced
former
vice-president
is
putting
everyone
else
in
the
shade
he
leads
his
nearest
rival
bernie
sanders
by
points
yet
there
is
one
candidate
of
whom
more
brilliance
might
have
been
anticipated
kamala
harris
the
first-term
senator
from
california
is
stuck
in
single
digits
despite
a
strong
launch
and
early
fundraising
she
is
the
contest's
most
conspicuous
under-performer
lexington
went
to
watch
her
campaigning
in
las
vegas
last
week
to
try
to
work
out
why
her
events
there
first
a
meeting
with
asian-american
leaders
in
a
vietnamese
restaurant
then
a
gathering
of
hispanics
in
a
mexican
one
pointed
to
a
reason
why
much
is
expected
of
her
a
high-achieving
daughter
of
an
indian
mother
and
jamaican
father
whose
state
has
more
hispanics
than
any
other
ms
harris
encapsulates
the
changing
democratic
party
first
and
foremost
seeing
you
as
a
woman
who
identifies
as
indo-caribbean
makes
me
happy
said
a
woman
nursing
a
baby
at
the
first
rally
and
ms
harris's
focus
on
nevada
an
early-voting
state
next
to
california
reflects
a
primary
schedule
that
is
another
potential
strength
if
she
can
emerge
from
the
opening
contests
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
looking
competitive
the
next
tranche
including
large
and
diverse
states
such
as
california
could
put
her
over
the
top
her
room-grabbing
presence
also
on
show
in
vegas
is
a
bigger
advantage
a
diminutive
former
state
attorney-general
she
combines
the
authority
of
a
prosecutor
with
the
all-aglow
enthusiasm
for
whoever
is
put
in
front
of
her
of
a
skilful
retail
politician
it
helps
that
she
looks
and
sounds
good
a
quality
barack
obama
once
remarked
on
in
a
rare
faux
pas
when
introducing
her
as
by
far
the
best-looking
attorney-general
in
the
country
to
be
sure
a
black
woman
vying
to
take
on
donald
trump
also
faces
hurdles
after
the
president's
misogynistic
treatment
of
hillary
clinton
some
democrats
consider
an
elderly
white
man
per
se
a
safer
bet
for
their
nominee
the
fact
that
mr
trump
has
already
labelled
ms
harris
nasty
an
adjective
he
applied
to
mrs
clinton
suggests
they
might
be
right
yet
those
who
believe
ms
harris
is
being
unfairly
judged
on
her
race
and
sex
should
hold
fire
first
because
on
the
slippery
question
of
electability
her
profile
and
attributes
have
already
given
her
a
sizeable
not
particularly
fair
advantage
over
similarly
qualified
candidates
why
else
did
she
enter
the
race
with
such
a
lead
over
cory
booker
and
amy
klobuchar
accomplished
though
she
is
ms
harris's
senate
career
has
been
brief
and
unmemorable
aside
from
a
few
tough
exchanges
with
administration
officials
in
the
judiciary
committee
moreover
as
her
performance
in
las
vegas
also
attested
she
is
doing
an
indifferent
job
of
capitalising
on
her
opportunity
she
has
accrued
a
reputation
for
excessive
caution
asked
about
reparations
for
african-americans
votes
for
prisoners
or
any
other
hot-button
issue
she
almost
invariably
expresses
a
keenness
to
contemplate
the
matter
further
she
has
attributed
this
tendency
to
a
lawyerly
fastidiousness
about
the
facts
yet
she
is
sometimes
rash
under
the
tutelage
of
her
sister
maya
mrs
clinton's
former
policy
guru
she
seems
determined
not
to
get
outflanked
by
the
left
on
any
issue
whether
she
fully
grasps
it
or
not
hence
her
support
for
medicare
for
all
free
college
fining
companies
that
fail
to
narrow
their
gender
pay-gap
and
her
embarrassing
later
retracted
suggestion
that
she
would
scrap
private
health-care
insurance
and
still
no
one
believes
she
is
a
proper
leftie
she
spent
most
of
her
career
as
a
tough-on-crime
prosecutor
she
famously
criminalised
the
parents
of
truants
and
when
not
vowing
to
support
the
latest
left-wing
fad
she
sounds
strikingly
unideological
her
stump
speech
which
is
based
on
an
idea
that
america
needs
more
truth
and
justice
is
a
painfully
contrived
effort
to
marry
her
strengths
to
a
critique
of
mr
trump
it
neither
informs
nor
inspires
it
has
nothing
of
the
revolutionary
fire
that
consumes
mr
sanders
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
talented
centre-left
opportunist
who
has
not
quite
found
her
place
in
her
party
let
alone
the
distinctive
voice
voters
crave
her
attempt
to
fight
the
primaries
on
the
left
where
she
has
shallow
roots
has
only
made
this
more
obvious
it
is
probably
also
mistaken
given
mr
biden's
success
and
the
moderate
instincts
of
the
non-white
voters
she
is
banking
on
asians
just
want
someone
who
won't
throw
us
out
of
the
country
said
a
chinese-american
businessman
at
ms
harris's
first
event
ideally
he
said
that
person
would
be
a
moderate
as
he
thought
ms
harris
probably
was
at
least
the
ambiguity
surrounding
ms
harris
gives
her
room
for
manoeuvre
in
imitation
of
mr
biden
she
is
ramping
up
her
attacks
on
the
president
including
by
arguing
for
his
impeachment
this
is
another
bid
to
underline
her
ability
to
prosecute
the
case
against
trump
as
she
says
but
it
is
unclear
who
would
be
likelier
to
vote
for
her
as
a
result
most
democrats
want
the
candidate
they
consider
likeliest
to
beat
mr
trump
which
requires
general-election
votes
not
pugilism
yet
the
shift
could
at
least
give
her
space
if
she
is
wise
to
reappraise
her
default
leftishness
she
probably
cannot
beat
mr
biden
that
way
by
the
same
token
however
his
surge
looks
even
more
daunting
for
inflexible
leftists
such
as
mr
sanders
that
could
make
it
a
net
gain
for
ms
harris
ill-prepared
and
too
calculating
though
she
seems
she
still
looks
well-placed
to
take
over
from
mr
biden
if
he
stumbles
as
he
easily
may
ms
harris
seems
to
be
a
lucky
politician
whether
her
luck
would
hold
out
against
mr
trump
is
another
matter
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
