presidential
debates
seldom
move
opinion
polls
primary
debates
are
a
different
matter
for
devoted
election-watchers
the
onslaught
of
on-the-ground
reporting
and
analysis
from
feet
that
acccompanies
a
campaign
is
pleasurable
but
voter
preferences
tend
to
be
more
stable
than
front-page
coverage
which
typically
consists
of
assorted
gaffes
and
flip-flops
might
suggest
primary
debates
really
do
matter
though
the
democrats
hold
their
first
one
in
miami
next
week
an
increase
in
available
polling
over
the
decades
has
helped
the
economist
quantify
their
impact
primary
debates
are
responsible
for
changes
in
polling
that
rival
the
effects
of
the
iowa
caucuses
on
public
opinion
general-election
debates
rarely
move
opinion
polls
because
voters
choices
are
largely
dictated
by
their
partisan
allegiance
most
of
those
who
bother
to
tune
in
have
already
tuned
the
other
party
out
in
primary
debates
though
this
does
not
apply
partisan
allegiance
will
not
help
a
democrat
choose
between
senators
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
and
michael
bennet
of
colorado
primary
voters
are
also
more
receptive
to
arguments
about
policy
and
electability
than
the
wider
public
is
hillary
clinton's
lead
in
public
polling
increased
nearly
nine
percentage
points
in
the
two
weeks
that
followed
the
first
debate
of
the
democratic
nomination
according
to
data
made
available
by
charles
franklin
a
political
scientist
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
donald
trump
experienced
a
four-point
bump
in
the
two
weeks
after
his
first
debate
what
happened
in
the
years
before
were
the
bonuses
that
mrs
clinton
and
mr
trump
received
atypical
or
part
of
a
pattern
to
find
out
we
analysed
mr
franklin's
polling
data
which
span
all
presidential
primary
elections
from
to
using
a
technique
called
bayesian
change-point
analysis
to
calculate
a
polling
average
that
is
not
too
sensitive
to
outlier
polls
as
some
other
approaches
are
we
assume
it
takes
about
two
weeks
from
the
date
of
a
debate
for
any
new
information
arising
from
that
debate
to
be
reflected
in
public
opinion
and
for
pollsters
to
gather
their
data
our
calculation
shows
that
the
year
before
a
presidential
election
the
average
change
in
a
candidate's
polling
numbers
in
the
two
weeks
after
a
debate
was
debates
held
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
the
election
year
have
even
larger
effects
an
average
change
of
but
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
it
was
the
debates
that
made
the
difference
or
something
that
happened
at
the
same
time
as
the
debate
such
as
a
primary
election
or
caucus
admittedly
most
of
the
movement
in
polls
after
a
primary
debate
consists
of
small
fluctuations
spread
out
between
many
candidates
yet
primary
debates
do
sometimes
cause
an
obscure
candidate
to
become
a
star
or
a
star
candidate
to
implode
compared
with
a
regular
week
in
the
year
before
the
election
debates
are
six
times
as
likely
to
produce
a
large
increase
or
decrease
in
voting
intentions

primary
debates
are
one
of
the
most
important
events
of
a
campaign
and
match
other
disruptions
there
is
little
difference
between
a
debate
and

dramatic
event

that
they
are
almost
always
consequential
with
the
democratic
debates
kicking
off
next

the
candidates
who
will
appear
divided

two
separate
