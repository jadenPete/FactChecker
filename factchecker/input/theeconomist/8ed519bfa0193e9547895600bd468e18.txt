beleaguered
unions
seek
members
beyond
the
factory
floor
but
how
terrifying
is
a
striking
graduate
staffer
judging
by
recent
headlines
america's
unions
appear
stuck
in
time
consider
one
of
the
biggest
the
united
auto
workers
uaw
its
odd
members
include
nearly
who
work
at
detroit's
big
three
carmakers
gm
ford
and
fiat
chrysler
the
uaw's
boss
gary
jones
was
busy
this
week
hammering
out
a
four-year
labour
contract
for
them
starting
at
gm
before
the
current
one
expires
on
september
th
if
not
strikes
loom
yet
he
is
likely
to
feel
distracted
mr
jones
has
endured
intense
scrutiny
since
federal
investigators
in
late
august
raided
his
home
those
of
former
bosses
and
a
union
resort
in
michigan
the
feds
have
been
busy
exposing
bribery
at
the
uaw
in
a
case
that
has
rumbled
on
for
years
so
far
nine
union
leaders
have
been
charged
and
eight
convicted
for
taking
dodgy
payments
and
gifts
including
pairs
of
shoes
mr
jones
has
not
been
charged
but
fellow
bosses
graft
casts
a
poor
light
if
members
lose
trust
in
him
they
might
strike
rather
than
take
whatever
deal
he
extracts
from
carmakers
that
reputational
hit
could
weaken
union
efforts
elsewhere
the
uaw
and
others
long
dreamed
of
organising
workers
at
southern
foreign-owned
transplants
whose
car
factories
are
likelier
than
detroit's
to
grow
scandal
makes
it
harder
to
imagine
winning
them
over
at
the
same
time
overall
union
membership
has
been
declining
just
of
private-sector
employees
are
in
unions
from
a
peak
of
in
last
year
the
supreme
court
reduced
unions
ability
to
take
levies
from
public-sector
workers
beyond
recent
headlines
however
the
likes
of
the
uaw
have
some
reasons
to
cheer
as
unions
have
weakened
the
public's
sympathy
for
them
has
grown
a
gallup
poll
on
august
th
suggested
of
americans
approve
of
unions
close
to
a
year
high
see
chart
similarly
a
pew
study
last
year
said
see
less
unionisation
as
mostly
bad
for
working
people
this
uptick
probably
has
many
causes
for
one
workers
are
in
a
jauntier
mood
thanks
to
a
tightening
labour
market
with
rising
wages
in
the
past
few
years
harry
katz
of
cornell
university
suggests
unions
are
also
helped
by
their
remarkable
success
in
promoting
higher
minimum
wages
in
many
states
politics
may
be
shifting
attitudes
too
donald
trump
won
votes
of
of
union
households
in
a
historically
high
share
that
was
only
slightly
behind
hillary
clinton's
poor
for
a
democrat
this
year
democratic
candidates
not
just
the
leftiest
ones
are
falling
over
each
other
to
praise
unions
and
labour
rights
such
as
paid
parental
leave
sick
days
and
holidays
among
the
public
youngsters
look
the
most
supportive
points
out
steven
greenhouse
author
of
a
book
that
traces
unions
changing
fortunes
an
earlier
poll
shows
of
to
year-olds
approve
of
unions
he
argues
the
young
are
spurred
on
by
worries
over
income
inequality
and
burdens
of
student
debt
mr
katz
sees
other
drivers
such
as
the
rise
of
informal
affinity
groups
when
workers
organise
over
a
particular
issue
rather
than
pay
bargaining
for
example
last
november
google
staff
walked
out
to
protest
against
the
way
bosses
handled
charges
of
sexual
harassment
such
groups
mr
katz
thinks
might
stir
interest
in
unions
proper
industrial
unions
have
also
spent
the
past
few
decades
hunting
for
professional
members
overall
white-collar
unionisation
slid
to
last
year
down
from
a
decade
before
but
the
decline
has
been
less
rapid
than
for
blue-collar
workers
the
uaw
counts
white-collar
members
among
its
ranks
staff
at
the
brooklyn
academy
of
music
belong
to

this

the

more
journalists
appear
to
be
joining

the
newsguild
representing

workers
says
it
has
members
in
north
america
a
slight
increase
over
the
past
few

the

the

boasts
of
academic

mostly
junior

who
may
face
precarious
working
conditions
dan
parsons
president
of
a
strong
uaw
affiliate
at
the
university
of
washington
traces
a
pretty
rapid
increase
in
recent
membership
his
union
recently
signed
up
post-doctoral
staff
todd
wolfson
president
of
a
union
of
at
rutgers
says
in
the
past
year
he
has
seen
more
interest
than
for
a
decade
as
adjuncts
and
graduate
workers
enrolled
junior
instructors
feel
exploited
when
asked
to
work
hour
weeks
for
paltry
pay
he
says
as
universities
hire
fewer
tenured
staff
they
depend
on
such
non-faculty
so
we
are
all
just
widgets
that's
why
people
are
so
attracted
to
unions
if
the
uaw
and
others
sign
up
more
white-collar
workers
while
losing
blue
ones
will
the
clout
of
the
unions
change
not
for
a
while
mr
katz
points
out
that
academic
unions
remain
fragmented
across
the
country
and
as
marick
masters
at
wayne
state
university
notes
service
workers
have
less
bargaining
power
than
carmakers
who
can
threaten
as
in
detroit
this
month
to
close
massive
factories
strikes
by
casino
staff
or
graduate
lecturers
might
not
make
the
same
impression
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
