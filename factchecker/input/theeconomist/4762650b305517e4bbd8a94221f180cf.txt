remembering
senator
richard
lugar
an
old-school
republican
advancing
world
peace
does
not
play
well
in
a
primary
richard
lugar
who
died
on
april
th
was
not
a
colourful
senator
one
federal
bureaucrat
joked
that
mr
lugar
maintained
that
childhood
capability
of
walking
into
an
empty
room
and
blending
right
in
dick
was
looked
upon
as
being
one
smart
dude
said
rex
early
who
ran
one
of
mr
lugar's
campaigns
but
would
i
want
to
go
fishing
with
him
probably
not
deprived
of
potential
fishing
buddies
mr
lugar
had
to
settle
for
making
the
world
safer
he
helped
override
ronald
reagan's
veto
of
a
bill
imposing
hefty
sanctions
on
apartheid-era
south
africa
he
bucked
reagan
again
by
publicly
stating
that
ferdinand
marcos
owed
his
re-election
in
the
philippines
to
fraud
reagan
initially
backed
marcos
but
soon
withdrew
support
leading
to
marcos's
exile
during
mr
lugar's
second
stint
chairing
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
he
had
doubts
about
the
second
iraq
war
after
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
he
and
sam
nunn
a
centrist
democratic
senator
wangled
some
funds
from
congress
to
dismantle
weapons
of
mass
destruction
nunn-lugar
as
the
programme
is
known
funded
the
deactivation
of
thousands
of
weapons
as
well
as
tens
of
thousands
of
tonnes
of
chemical
agents
that
was
not
enough
to
save
him
from
his
party
in
he
lost
a
primary
to
a
tea-partying
republican
mr
lugar's
legacy
said
barack
obama
when
awarding
him
the
presidential
medal
of
freedom
in
is
the
thousands
of
missiles
and
bombers
and
submarines
and
warheads
that
no
longer
threaten
us
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
