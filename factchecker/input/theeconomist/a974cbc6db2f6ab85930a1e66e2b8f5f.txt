what
is
it
with
shoe
polish
in
virginia
scandals
ensnare
the
state's
top
three
elected
officials
as
the
economist
went
to
press
consumer-protection
offices
in
virginia
had
not
yet
announced
plans
to
affix
a
sticker
to
every
canister
of
shoe
polish
sold
in
the
state
reading
for
footwear
not
faces
that
the
stuff
should
be
used
to
brighten
shoes
rather
than
darken
faces
may
seem
obvious
to
most
but
not
to
ralph
northam
and
mark
herring
respectively
virginia's
governor
and
attorney-general
both
democrats
on
february
st
a
website
released
mr
northam's
page
from
his
medical-school
yearbook
on
which
a
picture
showed
a
man
in
blackface
grinning
next
to
a
man
in
a
ku
klux
klan
outfit
one
of
mr
northam's
former
classmates
angry
at
the
governor's
clumsily
worded
defence
of
a
bill
loosening
restrictions
on
abortion
reportedly
alerted
the
website
to
the
page
over
the
next
two
days
mr
northam
provided
an
object
lesson
in
how
not
to
respond
to
a
political
crisis
shortly
after
the
picture
emerged
he
apologised
for
the
decision
i
made
to
appear
as
i
did
he
did
not
say
whether
he
was
in
klan
robes
or
blackface
during
a
surreal
press
conference
he
then
said
that
in
fact
he
was
not
in
the
picture
though
he
admitted
to
once
having
darkened
my
face
as
part
of
a
michael
jackson
costume
he
appeared
ready
after
a
reporter's
question
to
start
moonwalking
until
his
wife
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
appropriate
circumstances
democrats
from
nancy
pelosi
to
mr
herring
have
urged
him
to
resign
he
has
so
far
resisted
and
is
reportedly
considering
leaving
the
democratic
party
and
serving
out
the
rest
of
his
term
virginia
governors
cannot
run
for
a
second
consecutive
term
as
an
independent
if
he
steps
down
he
will
be
replaced
by
justin
fairfax
the
year-old
african-american
lieutenant-governor
also
a
democrat
but
mr
fairfax
has
problems
of
his
own
vanessa
tyson
a
university
professor
said
he
sexually
assaulted
her
at
the
democratic
national
convention
in
mr
fairfax
admitted
to
knowing
ms
tyson
but
said
that
she
was
very
much
into
a
consensual
encounter
ms
tyson
said
that
he
physically
forced
her
to
perform
oral
sex
should
messrs
northam
and
fairfax
both
resign
mr
herring
is
next
in
line
but
on
february
th
mr
herring
admitted
that
he
too
attended
a
party
in
wigs
and
blackface
dressed
like
rappers
we
listened
to
at
the
time
like
kurtis
blow
mr
herring
apologised
profusely
and
left
open
the
possibility
of
resignation
but
for
the
moment
he
too
remains
in
office
if
all
three
leave
then
kirk
cox
the
republican
house
speaker
of
virginia's
general
assembly
would
become
the
state's
governor
mr
cox
holds
the
speakership
because
republicans
won
a
majority
in
the
lower
house
after
the
state's
board
of
elections
drew
a
name
out
of
a
hat
in
a
district
where
the
democratic
and
republican
candidates
received
exactly
the
same
number
of
votes
mr
cox
assuming
he
was
never
photographed
in
blackface
would
then
get
to
appoint
a
lieutenant-governor
and
the
republican-controlled
legislature
would
elect
an
attorney-general
republicans
who
have
not
won
a
statewide
race
in
virginias
since
are
salivating
at
the
prospect
of
claiming
all
three
top
posts
but
as
long
as
they
line
up
behind
a
president
whose
record
on
race
or
groping
is
not
exactly
woke
their
condemnations
of
messrs
northam
fairfax
and
herring
may
ring
a
little
bit
hollow
yet
if
the
democrats
position
is
that
doing
something
offensive
while
in
university
renders
someone
unfit
to
hold
office
regardless
of
whether
his
attitudes
and
political
views
have
since
changed
they
risk
setting
an
impossible
standard
perhaps
their
current
zeal
mirrors
the
lack
of
it
across
the
aisle
democrats
may
feel
that
they
must
be
less
forgiving
because
mr
trump
has
made
the
previously
unsayable
acceptable
perhaps
the
three
accused
men
have
also
taken
a
lesson
from
the
president
that
if
they
hunker
down
and
withstand
the
outrage
the
news
cycle
will
eventually
move
on
to
fresher
meat
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
