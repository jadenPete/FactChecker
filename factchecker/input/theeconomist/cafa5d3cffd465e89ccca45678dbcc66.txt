what
group
of
people
is
most
hostile
to
metoo
republican
women
over
the
age
of
no
group
has
swung
against
metoo
more
than
older
women
who
voted
for
donald
trump
they
have
gone
from
barely
worrying
about
false
accusations
of
sexual
assault
with
only
agreeing
in
november
that
these
were
worse
than
unreported
assaults
to
saying
so
according
to
two
polls
conducted
for
the
economist
by
yougov
a
pollster
they
are
now
the
most
likely
group
to
agree
that
a
man
who
harassed
a
woman
years
ago
should
keep
his
job
and
that
a
woman
who
complains
about
harassment
causes
more
problems
than
she
solves
two
things
stand
out
first
even
though
americans
on
average
and
republicans
in
particular
have
become
more
negative
about
metoo
over
the
past
year
the
change
among
this
particular
group
is
spectacular
chart
second
a
generational
gap
now
yawns
between
republican
women
who
are
over
and
those
under
the
cohort
least
hostile
to
metoo
within
the
republican
party
one
obvious
difference
between
the
two
groups
is
that
many
of
the
over-
s
have
grown-up
sons
in
some
of
them
fell
off
their
pedestals
as
hundreds
of
men
were
publicly
named
and
shamed
over
sexual
misconduct
allegations
many
more
feared
that
some
lady
from
the
past
could
with
one
accusation
destroy
them
and
their
family
this
lady
became
personified
in
christine
blasey
ford
when
in
september
she
accused
brett
kavanaugh
of
sexual
assault
threatening
to
derail
his
nomination
to
the
supreme
court
all
this
helped
fuel
a
backlash
against
metoo
and
not
just
among
men
many
twitter
threads
on
himtoo
the
hashtag
about
false
accusations
were
posted
by
worried
mothers
we
saw
the
split
among
republican
women
widen
around
the
kavanaugh
hearings
a
lot
of
the
rhetoric
illustrated
the
generational
gap
remembers
jennifer
pierotti
lim
from
republican
women
for
progress
a
campaign
group
there's
a
feeling
amongst
that
generation
that
a
little
light
sexual
assault
is
no
big
deal
for
women
of
our
generation
that's
hard
to
understand
carrie
lukas
of
the
independent
women's
forum
a
conservative
advocacy
group
recognises
what
the
movement
has
done
in
encouraging
people
to
speak
out
against
prominent
men
who
people
have
known
were
problems
but
wonders
whether
it
has
gone
too
far
i
don't
think
the
mantra
believe
all
women
is
sufficient
she
says
men
need
to
be
able
to
make
mistakes
and
have
conversations
with
women
and
not
be
walking
on
eggshells
yet
the
biggest
split
on
metoo
as
with
any
question
pollsters
ask
about
gender
is
not
between
genders
or
generations
but
between
political
affiliations
says
juliana
horowitz
from
the
pew
research
centre
democrats
have
barely
changed
their
views
on
metoo
over
the
past
year
even
as
republicans
have
grown
more
sceptical
no
split
separates
the
generation
of
nancy
pelosi
and
elizabeth
warren
from
younger
female
democrats
in
fact
boomer
clinton-voting
women
have
increased
their
support
for
metoo
over
the
past
year
the
partisan
gender
gap
has
already
widened
in
hillary
clinton
won
of
women
voters
in
the
mid-terms
of
women
voted
for
democrats
republicans
appear
unconcerned
a
recent
poll
found
that
of
likely
primary
voters
expressed
no
concern
that
only
of
the
party's
house
members
are
women
the
lowest
number
in
years
and
said
nothing
had
to
be
done
to
recruit
more
female
candidates
one
explanation
of
this
partisan
gap
is
that
it
reflects
a
difference
of
opinion
over
what
true
feminism
is
some
conservative
women
resist
what
they
see
as
special
treatment
for
women
as
vaguely
patronising
there
is
another
explanation
too
ms
pierotti
lim
of
republican
women
for
progress
remembers
campaigning
in
wisconsin
and
michigan
in
and
being
astonished
by
the
number
of
older
women
who
were
afraid
to
even
talk
to
her
and
who
let
their
republican-voting
husbands
fill
in
their
ballots
china's
