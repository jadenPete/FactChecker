america
withdraws
from
the
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
the
trump
administration's
latest
move
brings
back
cold-war
fears
the
intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
inf
has
been
a
pillar
of
arms
control
for
over
years
but
in
recent
years
it
has
been
crumbling
on
october
th
president
donald
trump
announced
that
he
intended
to
withdraw
america
from
the
treaty
and
build
up
missiles
until
russia
believed
to
be
cheating
on
the
pact
and
china
which
never
signed
it
came
to
their
senses
on
february
st
he
pulled
the
plug
after
russia
failed
to
meet
a
deadline
to
come
into
compliance
with
the
treaty
even
before
american
withdrawal
takes
effect
in
six
months
the
ripples
are
likely
to
be
felt
from
europe
to
asia
the
inf
treaty
has
its
origins
in
the
euromissile
crisis
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
the
soviet
union's
deployment
of
the
ss-
an
advanced
and
accurate
missile
that
could
strike
most
of
europe
from
deep
within
russia
alarmed
europe
america
had
short-range
missiles
in
europe
which
could
not
reach
soviet
territory
and
long-range
ones
at
home
and
aboard
submarines
but
nothing
in
this
middle
category
if
the
soviets
attacked
europe
with
the
ss-
america
would
be
forced
to
escalate
to
its
biggest
weapons
european
allies
fretted
that
it
would
not
do
so
to
assuage
these
concerns
and
to
force
the
soviet
union
to
change
course
america
deployed
the
pershing
ii
ballistic
missile
and
a
new
ground-launched
cruise
missile
into
europe
that
in
turn
worried
the
soviet
union
these
could
reach
moscow
in
under
ten
minutes
potentially
forcing
leaders
into
a
panicky
response
anti-nuclear
protests
roiled
europe
as
the
new
weapons
rolled
in
the
inf
treaty
cut
through
this
knot
it
prohibited
not
only
the
offending
soviet
and
american
missiles
but
also
the
flight-testing
development
and
deployment
of
all
ground-based
missiles
both
nuclear
and
conventional
with
ranges
between
and
miles
almost
existing
weapons
were
destroyed
with
the
soviet
union
getting
rid
of
twice
as
many
why
has
the
agreement
now
snapped
the
most
important
reason
is
russian
cheating
america
and
its
nato
allies
accuse
russia
of
flight-testing
and
then
deploying
an
inf-range
cruise
missile
called
the
m
russia
displayed
the
missile
at
a
military
theme-park
outside
moscow
on
january
rd
without
convincing
anyone
of
its
bona
fides
another
nail
in
the
pact's
coffin
was
china
in
the
s
vladimir
putin
toyed
with
the
idea
of
leaving
the
deal
as
other
states
including
a
rising
china
whose
relationship
with
russia
remained
testy
were
racking
up
non-nuclear
intermediate-range
missiles
as
ties
between
russia
and
china
warmed
these
concerns
faded
it
became
america's
turn
to
worry
that
china
was
accumulating
missiles
beyond
the
treaty's
grasp
while
america
had
to
put
its
own
aboard
expensive
and
scarce
ships
submarines
and
aircraft
many
in
the
pentagon
see
a
golden
opportunity
to
redress
the
missile
balance
in
asia
should
the
treaty
collapse
in
the
summer
as
now
seems
likely
there
would
be
several
consequences
russia
might
build
up
intermediate-range
missiles
aimed
at
europe
these
could
include
not
only
the
m
but
also
the
rs-
rubezh
an
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
that
has
been
tested
at
ranges
near
the
upper
limit
of
the
inf
hence
nato's
warning
on
february
st
of
significant
risks
to
euro-atlantic
security
in
turn
america
would
speed
up
its
pursuit
of
a
matching
capability
officials
admit
that
research
is
in
the
early
stages
a
working
missile
is
at
least
a
year
away
any
missile
race
might
also
spell
trouble
for
the
new
start
treaty
a
us-russian
arms-control
deal
that
covers
mostly
longer-range
weapons
due
to
be
renewed
in
if
such
missiles
do
materialise
putting
them
anywhere
useful
will
require
virtuoso
diplomacy
european
leaders
would
shy
away
from
accepting
them
perhaps
more
so
after
mr
putin's
threat
on
october
th
that
hosts
would
expose
their
territory
to
the
threat
of
a
possible
retaliatory
strike
if
america
were
to
cut
a
deal
with
one
or
two
more
enthusiastic
allies
like
poland
over
nato's
head
it
would
shake
the
alliance
a
major
summit
is
due
in
march
ahead
of
the
organisation's
th
birthday
in
april
it
is
less
clear
how
asian
allies
would
respond
japanese
diplomats
are
cagey
south
korea's
dovish
government
is
unlikely
to
play
ball
guam
a
heavily
forested
island
might
be
the
likeliest
option
though
its
distance
from
china
might
count
against
it
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival

bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
