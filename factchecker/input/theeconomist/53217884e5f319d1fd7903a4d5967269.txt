jim
mattis
and
john
kelly
had
little
influence
on
the
president
they
were
however
safeguards
against
calamity
shortly
after
his
inauguration
donald
trump
paused
during
an
awkward
address
to
congressmen
and
pointed
to
jim
mattis
and
john
kelly
two
of
the
five
retired
or
current
generals
who
served
in
his
administration
early
on
i
see
my
generals
he
said
proudly
these
are
central
casting
if
i'm
doing
a
movie
i'd
pick
you
general
general
mattis
that
shallow
idea
of
military
leadership
was
said
to
owe
much
to
george
c.
scott's
lead
performance
in
the
film
patton
a
trump
favourite
mr
mattis
the
incoming
defence
secretary
was
in
reality
better
known
for
his
intellectualism
than
his
craggy
looks
or
for
the
moniker
mad
dog
mattis
that
the
president
loved
and
he
hated
yet
mr
trump's
bigger
misjudgment
was
to
assume
that
the
generals
the
last
of
whom
mr
mattis
departed
his
administration
this
week
would
serve
as
ruthless
executors
of
his
will
that
mistaken
apprehension
signalled
by
the
gleeful
possessive
my
generals
was
one
of
several
reasons
why
he
hired
them
others
smacked
of
desperation
mr
trump
didn't
know
much
about
foreign
and
security
policy
most
republican
foreign-policy
experts
had
denounced
him
as
a
charlatan
and
he
cannot
forgive
a
slight
senior
military
officers
who
tend
to
refrain
from
commenting
on
politics
looked
like
a
convenient
alternative
they
also
fitted
with
mr
trump's
hazy
understanding
of
his
new
job
as
commander-in-chief
he
expected
to
issue
orders
with
the
olympian
majesty
of
a
hollywood
general
by
surrounding
himself
with
real-life
ones
he
assumed
he
would
have
a
disciplined
team
of
experts
in
carrying
orders
out
that
the
generals
tough-guy
cachet
would
glorify
his
imagined
own
was
an
additional
delight
it
did
not
work
out
that
way
mainly
because
mr
trump's
notion
of
presidential
power
was
as
realistic
as
his
idea
of
generalship
poor
ike
it
won't
be
a
bit
like
the
army
mused
harry
truman
on
his
incoming
successor
dwight
eisenhower
he'll
sit
here
and
he'll
say
do
this
do
that
and
nothing
will
happen
his
point
was
that
american
politicians
including
commanders-in-chief
have
less
power
than
responsibility
to
effect
change
even
popular
competent
ones
must
work
with
the
grain
of
the
law
and
establishment
opinion
and
around
congressional
and
other
interests
mr
trump
having
little
understanding
of
legal
boundaries
or
attention
span
or
interest
in
building
consensus
or
long-term
view
of
almost
anything
was
always
liable
to
be
even
more
constrained
an
excited
focus
on
mr
mattis
and
the
rest's
high-minded
efforts
to
foil
mr
trump
has
tended
to
obscure
this
reality
certainly
in
another
illustration
of
how
little
mr
trump
understood
whom
he
had
hired
the
generals
first
loyalty
was
not
to
him
but
to
the
national
interest
and
institutions
they
had
served
for
decades
they
therefore
advised
him
against
impulsive
moves
such
as
withdrawing
from
the
paris
climate
deal
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
the
syrian
and
afghan
conflicts
which
went
against
those
interests
yet
they
appear
to
have
won
few
of
those
arguments
as
mr
mattis
signalled
by
resigning
in
protest
last
month
at
times
to
be
sure
the
generals
came
close
to
openly
defying
the
president
mr
mattis's
slow-walking
of
his
demands
for
a
ban
on
transgender
soldiers
and
a
north
korea-style
military
parade
were
examples
of
that
yet
they
were
rare
the
generals
mostly
stymied
mr
trump
only
to
the
extent
that
any
halfway
responsible
cabinet
secretary
would
have
done
by
treating
his
tweets
lightly
reassuring
worried
underlings
that
they
had
their
backs
and
informing
the
president
of
the
limits
of
his
authority
why
can't
we
do
it
this
way
the
president
often
harrumphed
at
mr
kelly
straining
on
his
legal
and
constitutional
leash
yet
he
never
ordered
the
then
white
house
chief
of
staff
to
crack
on
and
break
the
law
set
against
the
consternation
excited
by
the
generals
departure
this
record
seems
moderately
reassuring
mr
trump
has
made
many
bad
moves
in
security
and
other
policy
against
the
generals
advice
that
he
has
nonetheless
done
less
damage
than
he
has
threatened
by
failing
to
go
to
war
with
north
korea
or
reinstitute
torture
for
example
is
probably
not
mostly
down
to
them
either
he
appears
to
dislike
war
he
has
for
the
most
part
followed
legal
advice
he
appears
too
ill-disciplined
to
pursue
a
complicated
policy
for
long
including
his
signature
ones
like
the
national
security
strategy
drawn
up
by
lieutenant-general
h.r.
mcmaster
as
national
security
adviser
which
makes
a
reasonable
fist
of
turning
america
first
into
a
coherent
world-view
there
is
no
strong
evidence
mr
trump
has
read
it
or
that
he
means
to
pursue
the
great-power
rivalry
with
china
that
is
its
central
promise
the
biggest
check
on
trumpian
disruption
good
or
bad
is
mr
trump
the
generals
absence
may
therefore
have
less
tangible
effect
than
many
fear
mr
mcmaster
and
mr
kelly
had
both
become
peripheral
figures
by
the
time
they
were
moved
on
the
former
white
house
chief
had
also
become
uniquely
disliked
by
both
the
president
and
the
media
and
mr
mattis
exhausted
by
his
efforts
to
reassure
allies
and
shield
colleagues
from
mr
trump
has
left
relatively
little
mark
on
his
department
having
been
chosen
by
mr
trump
against
his
advice
the
likely
next
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
general
mark
milley
might
even
have
more
sway
with
the
president
on
military
matters
than
mr
mattis
had
even
so
the
generals
will
be
missed
their
presence
meant
that
if
the
worst
happened
and
under
mr
trump
that
is
always
possible
america
would
have
strong
reliable
public
servants
close
to
the
helm
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
john
bolton
and
mike
pompeo
mr
trump's
remaining
national
security
chiefs
in
addition
the
presence
of
mr
mattis
especially
was
a
reminder
that
moral
leadership
is
still
prized
in
america
and
that
had
concrete
effects
when
the
former
defence
secretary
urged
american
allies
to
bear
with
us
at
this
uncertain
time
for
america's
traditional
alliances
they
listened
there
is
no
one
left
in
the
administration
who
could
provide
the
same
reassurance
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
