lessons
from
bloody
harlan
a
brief
reopening
of
the
class
struggle
in
deepest
appalachia
slams
shut
not
since
the
s
had
the
miners
of
bloody
harlan
county
been
so
united
in
fury
it
was
bad
enough
when
blackjewel
mining
one
of
the
main
employers
in
their
eastern
kentucky
community
and
the
sixth-biggest
mining
company
in
america
went
bust
in
july
with
their
wages
unpaid
but
then
word
got
out
that
the
bankrupt
company
had
sold
and
was
about
to
shift
almost
trucks
of
coal
that
the
unrecompensed
miners
had
dug
up
half
a
dozen
of
them
took
to
the
tracks
and
turned
the
train
back
another
score
with
wives
and
kids
and
neighbours
in
tow
helped
them
pitch
a
makeshift
camp
across
the
line
no
pay
we
stay
was
their
slogan
daubed
in
a
militant-rustic
style
on
a
bedsheet
banner
a
local
restaurateur
sent
provisions
bluegrass
musicians
provided
entertainment
and
journalists
brought
attention
to
the
fight
yet
it
was
when
the
miners
were
joined
by
a
group
of
transgender
anarchists
acknowledged
some
of
the
handful
still
camping
out
on
the
track
last
week
amid
vast
piles
of
donated
toiletries
and
food
and
a
rising
panic
about
bears
that
they
really
got
their
camp
organised
it
is
amazing
how
strange
this
impromptu
protest
has
turned
out
to
be
and
how
revealing
of
america's
culture
wars
that
is
in
part
because
of
history
the
miles-deep
coal
mines
of
harlan
county
a
region
of
wooded
appalachian
hills
rising
up
to
kentucky's
highest
point
were
for
decades
synonymous
with
violent
industrial
action
clashes
in
the
s
sparked
by
the
miners
efforts
to
unionise
gave
the
county
its
bloody
moniker
many
of
the
blackjewel
miners
fathers
and
grandfathers
were
involved
in
them
my
dad
told
me
about
it
gun
battles
and
company
gun
thugs
that
beat
you
to
death
recalled
darrell
raleigh
seated
beside
the
tracks
a
veteran
of
years
underground
he
himself
took
part
in
another
round
of
strikes
in
the
s
which
left
one
dead
and
was
the
subject
of
an
oscar-winning
documentary
publicised
on
social
media
as
bloodyharlan
the
blackjewel
blockade
looked
like
a
time-honoured
morally
unambiguous
stand-off
the
little
man
against
the
big
man
as
mr
raleigh
said
with
relish
the
harlan
miners
had
been
stiffed
their
community
had
rallied
around
them
splendidly
and
blackjewel's
ceo
jeff
hoops
looked
like
a
classic
fat-cat
villain
while
running
his
mining
company
into
the
ground
and
never
mind
its
miners
he
defaulted
on
corporate
taxes
while
pouring
millions
into
a
vanity
project
an
appalachian
resort
called
the
grand
patrician
named
after
his
wife
patricia
that
will
boast
a
seat
replica
of
the
coliseum
for
liberal
observers
including
journalists
activists
and
bernie
sanders
whose
campaign
sent
a
batch
of
pizzas
to
express
its
support
the
protest
represented
a
rare
opportunity
to
set
aside
the
vexed
and
divisive
realities
of
america's
dying
coal
industry
its
pollution
its
outsize
political
influence
its
unanimous
support
for
donald
trump
for
whom
of
bloody
harlanders
voted
and
reignite
the
class
war
the
arrival
of
the
anarchists
a
roving
band
of
hard-left
protesters
was
emblematic
of
that
effort
led
by
a
transgender
activist
called
lill
who
refused
to
give
a
second
name
and
preferred
to
be
referred
to
by
the
pronoun
they
these
efficient
activists
helped
install
a
solar
shower
and
camp
kitchen
while
dispensing
legal
advice
to
the
miners
they
were
just
a
big
bundle
of
joy
sighed
stacy
rowe
who
has
been
camping
out
with
her
miner-husband
chris
throughout
the
protest
yet
politics
impinged
early
this
month
the
anarchists
left
in
a
huff
after
the
miners
refused
to
bar
another
visitor
to
the
camp
a
member
of
a
group
of
activist
truckers
on
the
basis
that
he
wore
a
trump
t-shirt
and
espoused
far-right
views
ms
rowe
says
she
feels
for
them
but
i
can't
tell
someone
how
to
believe
politically
and
we
did
end
up
eating
bernie
sanders's
pizzas
which
i
didn't
have
a
problem
with
yet
since
the
anarchists
exit
coincidentally
or
not
the
protest
has
petered
out
most
of
the
miners
drifted
away
some
to
mines
in
other
states
others
to
retrain
as
truckers
or
in
hope
of
being
hired
by
the
company
seeking
to
reopen
blackjewel's
five
local
mines
mr
raleigh
insists
he
will
stay
put
until
we
get
paid
what's
owed
to
us
but
given
the
miners
poor
chance
of
recovering
the
full
sum
and
that
the
rowes
mainstays
of
the
camp
are
about
to
take
off
in
a
new
truck
that
seems
unlikely
in
a
few
days
the
bears
that
mr
raleigh
and
his
wife
are
sleeping
in
their
car
for
fear
of
will
probably
be
free
to
consume
the
camp's
leftover
reserves
of
cookies
and
watermelons
unmolested
for
those
on
the
left
such
as
mr
sanders
who
hope
to
win
back
the
white
working
class
with
economic
programmes
and
class-infused
rhetoric
this
is
a
cautionary
saga
the
industries
and
unions
that
made
those
politics
possible
are
too
diminished
kentucky
has
as
many
lawyers
as
it
has
miners
only
about
few
of
whom
are
unionised
that
helps
explain
why
those
in
harlan
are
still
awaiting
justice
even
after
the
state
governor
and
other
powerful
politicians
have
spoken
up
for
them
during
the
stand-off
the
social
decay
that
has
followed
that
institutional
retreat
is
another
reason
why
the
politics
of
economic
incentive
now
finds
little
purchase
among
them
the
population
of
east
kentucky
is
one
of
the
unhealthiest
most
addicted
prematurely
aged
and
otherwise
unemployable
in
america
mr
trump's
popularity
among
blue-collar
whites
in
harlan
and
elsewhere
is
not
based
on
his
promise
to
rebuild
their
shrunken
industries
having
long
since
given
up
hope
of
that
they
were
turning
to
the
republican
party's
quiet
white
identity
politics
long
before
he
upped
its
volume
that
is
why
hardly
any
miner
in
harlan
county
appeared
to
blame
a
president
who
promised
to
bring
back
coal
when
most
of
their
mines
closed
without
wishing
to
make
too
much
of
a
single
incident
it
was
also
why
a
row
at
the
blockade
between
a
trucker
in
a
trump
t-shirt
and
an
obliging
transgender
hippie
was
always
likely
to
go
the
trucker's
way
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
