the
legalisation
of
recreational
cannabis
is
weeding
out
teenaged
users
a
new
study
suggests
a
paradoxical
relationship
between
usage
and
the
law
when
justin
trudeau
promised
to
legalise
cannabis
use
across
the
border
in
canada
his
main
reason
for
doing
so
was
to
protect
the
young
cannabis
is
bad
for
the
developing
brain
and
a
worrying
number
of
minors
were
taking
the
drug
the
counterintuitive
proposal
was
based
on
the
idea
that
regulated
sales
would
drive
out
illegal
sellers
who
do
not
care
how
old
their
customers
are
legal
sellers
however
will
generally
abide
by
age
restrictions
in
sales
to
keep
their
licence
it
is
too
early
to
tell
whether
canada's
change
at
the
end
of
last
year
will
have
the
desired
effect
yet
there
is
a
wealth
of
historical
data
in
america
which
has
been
tinkering
with
various
forms
of
liberalisation
since
the
s
today
states
permit
medical
cannabis
and
have
legalised
recreational
use
the
most
recent
legalisation
bill
for
recreational
use
was
signed
in
illinois
on
june
th
until
now
the
evidence
on
youth
use
was
mixed
in
washington
state
one
study
found
increased
use
among
th
and
th
graders
after
legalisation
a
different
study
found
that
use
among
these
groups
actually
fell
however
a
new
study
in
the
journal
jama
pediatrics
attempts
a
more
comprehensive
national
analysis
using
data
from
biennial
appraisals
of
high-school
students
known
as
the
youth
risk
behaviour
surveys
it
found
that
relatively
permissive
laws
were
associated
with
a
decrease
in
frequent
cannabis
use
by
high-school
students
there
was
no
evidence
that
legalisation
of
cannabis
for
medical
purposes
encouraged
use
among
young
americans
although
the
drop
is
not
large
it
is
notable
given
policy
variation
between
states
some
states
will
have
been
more
successful
than
others
at
chipping
away
at
black-market
sales
regulating
licensed
sellers
and
getting
the
message
across
that
cannabis
is
damaging
to
young
brains
though
the
study
showed
only
that
a
correlation
between
policy
changes
and
a
dip
in
teenaged
use
a
causal
connection
is
plausible
across
the
country
cannabis
remains
a
big
and
flourishing
business
worth
nearly
bn
last
year
and
projected
to
rise
to
nearly
bn
by
yet
california
has
become
the
first
state
to
shrink
its
legal
market
after
legalisation
its
value
went
from
bn
in
to
just
bn
last
year
according
to
arcview
market
research
and
bds
analytics
the
finding
on
teenaged
use
will
put
wind
into
the
sails
of
advocates
for
liberalisation
most
of
the
public
across
many
demographic
groups
