jared
polis
colorado's
governor
is
an
unusual
breed
a
libertarian
democrat
he
must
strike
a
difficult
balance
if
colorado
were
a
piece
of
jewellery
it
would
be
a
mood
ring
changing
with
the
country's
political
temperature
or
at
least
that
used
to
be
the
case
today
colorado
looks
more
like
a
sapphire
featuring
varying
shades
of
blue
depending
on
one's
angle
after
the
election
it
became
a
democratic
trifecta
with
the
party
controlling
the
governor's
office
statehouse
and
senate
one
of
the
state's
two
senators
cory
gardner
is
a
republican
but
he
has
a
low
approval
rating
and
may
not
win
re-election
in
last
autumn's
election
was
the
most
significant
for
colorado's
political
realignment
in
more
than
years
says
floyd
ciruli
of
ciruli
associates
a
political
consulting
firm
the
type
of
republican
who
does
well
here
is
not
a
trump
republican
our
suburban
swing
electorate
is
more
attracted
to
the
reagan
version
of
republicanism
the
hopeful
version
of
republicanism
says
jared
polis
the
state's
new
governor
in
recent
years
colorado's
economy
has
boomed
with
the
state
attracting
young
and
educated
immigrants
from
other
states
who
tend
to
be
more
democratic
mr
polis
the
first
openly
gay
man
to
be
elected
as
governor
of
any
state
championed
a
progressive
agenda
on
the
campaign
trail
but
he
does
not
sound
like
your
average
democrat
he
backs
universal
health
care
an
expansion
of
full-day
kindergarten
paid
parental
leave
and
investments
in
renewable
energy
but
he
also
wants
to
lower
the
income-tax
rate
he
identifies
as
a
libertarian
the
less
government
intervention
in
our
private
lives
the
better
i
think
that's
a
value
many
coloradans
have
on
the
left
and
right
he
says
the
legislature
which
is
now
in
full
session
will
not
share
that
sense
of
moderation
and
is
likely
to
pull
mr
polis
further
left
than
he
wants
according
to
mr
ciruli
legislators
are
considering
bills
that
could
enrage
conservative
voters
including
eliminating
the
death
penalty
and
passing
a
red
flag
law
that
would
make
it
possible
to
seize
guns
from
someone
who
is
deemed
mentally
ill
after
a
judicial
process
lawmakers
are
unlikely
to
let
mr
polis
lower
income-tax
rates
which
he
wants
to
do
for
years
republicans
have
warned
that
colorado
could
become
like
california
if
democrats
got
too
much
power
that
prediction
sounded
far-fetched
since
the
start
of
this
legislative
session
however
the
state
stands
to
look
more
like
californian
than
it
ever
has
before
national
democrats
should
watch
what
solutions
colorado
adopts
on
questions
facing
all
states
such
as
health
care
parental
leave
public
education
and
the
environment
mr
polis
himself
deserves
some
credit
for
this
political
transformation
he
is
one
of
a
group
of
liberal
donors
called
the
gang
of
four
who
helped
democrats
flip
the
state
assembly
in
mr
polis
who
is
spent
his
youth
as
an
entrepreneur
building
companies
he
helped
to
transform
his
parents
company
blue
mountain
arts
into
an
online
greeting-card
firm
that
was
sold
for
around
m
in
and
built
up
proflowers
an
online
florist
which
was
sold
for
nearly
m
in
today
his
net
worth
is
estimated
at
several
hundred
million
dollars
and
he
has
freely
used
his
fortune
to
pursue
his
political
career
he
won
his
first
post
in
colorado
in
after
he
reportedly
spent
m
to
win
a
seat
on
the
board
of
education
his
opponent
spent
he
went
on
to
serve
five
terms
in
congress
before
running
for
governor
last
year
he
spent
more
than
m
of
his
own
money
on
his
campaign
or
around
of
the
total
raised
his
predecessor
in
the
governor's
mansion
john
hickenlooper
is
now
on
the
presidential
campaign
trail
hoping
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
some
wonder
whether
mr
polis
may
also
have
higher
aspirations
perhaps
to
be
the
country's
first
openly
gay
president
that
would
be
a
mount
elbert-sized
peak
to
climb
mr
polis
has
the
credentials
of
a
computer
geek
and
the
charisma
of
one
too
to
think
beyond
colorado
is
to
rush
ahead
in
the
story
the
state's
political
transformation
is
still
relatively
new
whether
it
lasts
will
depend
in
part
on
the
success
of
mr
polis's
reign
diplomacy
in
the
crossfire
of
donald
trump's
impeachment
battle
cummings
and
milne
rival
advisers
bent
on
disrupting
british
politics
from
rags
to
richer
a
tax
hike
threatens
the
health
of
japan's
economy
