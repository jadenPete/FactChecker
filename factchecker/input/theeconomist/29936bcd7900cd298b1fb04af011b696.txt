a
new
threat
to
new
orleans
more
snowmelt
to
the
north
plus
storms
in
the
gulf
equals
trouble
as
hurricanes
go
barry
hardly
qualified
for
the
title
poorly
organised
and
slow-moving
it
achieved
the
requisite
wind
speed
for
just
a
couple
of
hours
on
july
th
before
being
demoted
to
a
tropical
storm
but
for
new
orleans
mild
barry
was
a
wake-up
call
exposing
a
new
vulnerability
for
a
low-lying
city
the
possibility
that
the
vast
mississippi
still
swollen
in
july
months
after
it
typically
crests
could
be
pushed
over
its
banks
by
the
surge
a
tropical
storm
often
brings
in
flood-prone
new
orleans
floods
can
come
from
the
sea
from
the
river
or
from
the
sky
much
of
the
city
is
below
sea
level
and
its
topography
is
bowl-like
with
levees
forming
the
edges
when
torrential
rain
falls
as
it
often
does
there
is
nowhere
for
it
to
go
so
it
must
be
pumped
out
over
the
walls
the
potential
for
disaster
is
greater
when
a
levee
is
overtopped
or
worse
breached
by
tidal
lake
pontchartrain
or
the
river
which
bookend
the
city
hurricane
katrina
now
years
ago
was
the
modern
standard-setter
for
local
catastrophe
katrina's
formidable
surge
overwhelmed
a
system
of
levees
and
floodwalls
designed
to
keep
the
sea
at
bay
in
hurricanes
a
system
later
revealed
as
badly
flawed
eighty
percent
of
the
city
went
under
water
much
of
it
for
weeks
since
then
most
new
orleanians
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
which
oversees
the
system
of
levees
have
understandably
focused
their
attention
on
improving
the
defences
facing
the
sea
the
mississippi
river
the
very
reason
for
the
city's
precarious
siting
has
lately
been
an
afterthought
barry
helped
change
that
though
hurricane
season
runs
from
june
st
until
november
th
the
first
two
months
are
usually
quiet
in
the
gulf
barry
came
early
for
a
louisiana
cyclone
arriving
when
the
mississippi
which
rises
every
spring
with
snowmelt
and
rainfall
in
the
northern
states
and
canada
was
still
swollen
the
river's
height
as
it
passes
the
city
is
measured
against
sea
level
when
katrina
hit
in
august
it
was
around
three
feet
above
sea
level
when
barry
was
approaching
it
was
at
feet
above
just
as
they
do
to
the
seas
in
their
path
hurricanes
can
change
river
levels
when
katrina
churned
through
louisiana
the
river
level
shot
up
from
less
than
four
feet
to
nearly
in
the
city
not
enough
to
threaten
the
river
levees
but
close
early
forecasts
had
said
that
barry
might
raise
the
mississippi
by
four
feet
that
would
have
been
enough
to
reach
the
tops
of
some
of
the
city's
levees
scientists
are
still
trying
to
understand
how
the
extra
force
a
high
river
has
might
counteract
the
opposing
surge
a
powerful
hurricane
carries
but
had
barry
been
a
monster
like
katrina
or
even
a
less-catastrophic
storm
like
gustav
in
or
isaac
in
it
is
likely
that
the
flood
defences
along
the
river
would
have
failed
new
orleanians
are
used
to
thinking
about
stacked
threats
for
instance
the
possibility
that
a
slow-moving
hurricane
could
dump
tons
of
rain
flooding
the
city
from
within
even
as
a
storm
surge
menaces
from
without
barry
introduced
a
new
one
a
high
river
in
the
summer
pushed
over
its
banks
by
a
hurricane
this
new
menace
showed
itself
even
though
the
corps
of
engineers
has
taken
steps
this
year
to
lower
the
height
of
the
river
the
bonnet
carre
spillway
a
man-made
sluice
about
miles
upriver
from
new
orleans
that
diverts
water
to
lake
pontchartrain
is
not
put
into
service
in
most
years
this
year
it
has
been
open
for
days
a
new
record
and
yet
the
river
remains
high
for
new
orleanians
the
brush
with
hurricane
barry
was
a
reminder
that
their
city
has
been
made
more
vulnerable
by
global
warming
which
brings
rising
seas
and
an
increased
likelihood
of
powerful
hurricanes
oil
and
gas
exploration
has
hastened
the
erosion
of
the
wetlands
that
once
protected
the
region
and
the
river's
levees
while
keeping
the
mississippi
in
its
banks
have
starved
the
delta
of
sediment
and
led
it
to
sink
more
quickly
engineers
and
academics
are
starting
to
talk
about
ways
to
diminish
the
river's
flow
safely
in
the
future
by
creating
new
reservoirs
upstream
or
perhaps
restoring
wetlands
while
those
questions
are
debated
new
orleanians
will
be
keeping
an
eye
on
their
mighty
river
which
is
expected
to
remain
well
above
its
usual
height
as
the
peak
of

approaches
