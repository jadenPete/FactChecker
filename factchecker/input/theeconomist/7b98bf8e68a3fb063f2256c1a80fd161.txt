how
should
america
fight
the
next
downturn
the
recovery
is
ten
years
old
it
is
time
to
think
about
what
happens
next
on
june
st
the
expansion
will
pass
its
ten-year
anniversary
to
match
the
longest
on
record
america's
unemployment
rate
is
just
but
as
the
republican
party
basks
in
its
good
fortune
in
occupying
the
white
house
at
such
a
time
economists
a
doomy
bunch
are
suffering
a
sense
of
dread
they
fear
that
policymakers
are
missing
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
prepare
the
country
for
the
next
recession
no
one
knows
when
that
will
be
the
gaps
in
america's
economic
defences
are
not
so
hard
to
foresee
however
normally
when
recession
hits
monetary
policymakers
slash
interest
rates
in
response
to
a
downturn
with
interest
rates
as
low
as
they
are
today
there
is
little
room
to
do
so
legislation
to
provide
discretionary
stimulus
such
as
temporary
tax
cuts
or
spending
bumps
can
help
this
has
become
a
more
important
component
of
the
response
to
recession
in
america
agreeing
and
implementing
tax
cuts
and
spending
increases
takes
time
though
and
can
be
undermined
by
partisan
politicking
in
for
example
republican
politicians
forced
a
fiscal
policy
of
severe
contraction
on
an
economy
that
was
still
reeling
from
the
deepest
downturn
in
living
memory
with
the
result
that
the
recovery
was
probably
slower
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
if
politics
were
no
obstacle
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
respond
to
recessions
a
group
of
policy
wonks
convened
by
the
brookings
institution
and
the
washington
centre
for
equitable
growth
two
think-tanks
recently
proposed
an
array
of
fixes
for
congress
to
consider
rather
than
relying
on
politicians
to
do
the
right
thing
in
the
heat
of
a
crisis
they
reckon
that
america
needs
better
automatic
stabilisers
which
would
kick
in
quickly
when
a
recession
occurred
and
which
would
gradually
be
removed
when
the
economy
was
steady
enough
to
cope
without
them
claudia
sahm
of
the
federal
reserve
argued
in
favour
of
a
payment
to
all
americans
to
be
triggered
by
a
historically
accurate
and
timely
gauge
of
whether
the
economy
is
in
recession
the
idea
is
not
as
odd
as
it
sounds
the
payment
she
proposes
would
amount
to
of
gdp
around
half
of
the
typical
slowdown
in
consumer-spending
growth
in
a
recession
and
about
as
much
as
was
paid
out
to
american
families
as
part
of
the
economic
stimulus
act
of
perhaps
the
biggest
innovation
would
be
administrative
which
is
why
the
planning
would
need
to
start
now
recessions
tend
to
involve
downward
spirals
of
confidence
and
consumer
spending
separate
research
by
christina
patterson
of
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
has
found
that
the
people
whose
earnings
are
most
likely
to
crash
with
the
economy
young
black
men
say
cut
their
spending
most
sharply
when
their
income
falls
it
thus
might
make
sense
to
fight
future
recessions
by
putting
cash
straight
into
their
wallets
food
stamps
or
temporary
assistance
for
needy
families
two
welfare
programmes
that
have
an
immediate
impact
could
be
made
more
generous
in
recessions
for
example
or
unemployment
benefits
could
be
made
more
generous
or
more
widely
available
either
step
would
have
a
more
immediate
effect
than
extending
unemployment
benefits
for
longer
which
is
a
perennial
debate
in
congress
states
and
local
governments
have
historically
offset
around
a
quarter
of
federal-level
fiscal
stimulus
in
recessions
because
of
balanced-budget
requirements
that
force
them
to
tighten
their
belts
meaning
that
stimulus
from
the
federal
government
can
often
be
counteracted
at
a
local
level
in
theory
states
cities
and
counties
could
draw
on
rainy-day
funds
but
although
an
analysis
published
on
may
rd
by
moody's
analytics
a
consultancy
found
that
more
states
are
within
at
least
striking
distance
of
being
prepared
for
a
moderate
recession
it
found
that
many
states
were
not
even
close
one
solution
would
be
an
automatic
increase
in
federal
government
funds
for
state-level
medicaid
and
the
children's
health
insurance
programme
which
would
then
free
local
budgets
for
other
things
kevin
hassett
the
chairman
of
the
trump
administration's
council
of
economic
advisers
sees
merit
in
the
idea
of
strengthening
america's
automatic
stabilisers
as
it
can
take
too
long
to
realise
a
recession
is
happening
for
discretionary
stimulus
to
arrive
in
time
it's
a
good
time
to
think
about
it
he
muses
recalling
his
own
past
proposals
for
the
government
to
encourage
employers
to
share
out
hours
rather
than
make
workers
redundant
but
mr
hassett
points
out
that
the
trump
administration's
near-term
agenda
is
already
packed
he
also
seems
sceptical
about
the
idea
that
handing
out
lumps
of
cash
would
deliver
much
long-term
help
pointing
out
that
the
boost
to
gdp
may
just
be
temporary
and
then
only
the
bill
would
be
left
mr
hassett
argues
that
cuts
to
tax
rates
should
be
kept
on
the
table
some
wonks
still
hold
out
hope
for
change
in
the
more
distant
future
fixing
america's
defences
before
the
next
recession
looks
unlikely
but
if
congressional
staffers
get
to
work
on
drafting
legislation
now
then
when
the
next
recession
strikes
it
might
be
possible
to
introduce
better
automatic
stabilisers
just
in
time
for
the
recession
after
that
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
