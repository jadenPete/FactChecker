donald
trump
claims
vindication
over
the
mueller
report
but
it
may
not
prove
as
deflating
for
democrats
as
it
seems
for
two
years
democrats
have
reminded
voters
about
the
federal
investigators
pursuing
the
president
while
republicans
have
considered
that
investigation
to
be
a
distraction
from
the
vital
work
of
making
america
great
again
now
those
roles
are
reversed
robert
mueller's
investigation
is
over
and
according
to
a
summary
prepared
by
william
barr
the
attorney-general
mr
mueller
cleared
donald
trump
of
having
conspired
with
russia
and
did
not
recommend
charging
the
president
with
obstruction
of
justice
republicans
want
revenge
rand
paul
a
republican
senator
from
kentucky
wants
congress
to
investigate
barack
obama
the
white
house
wants
democrats
and
the
media
to
apologise
most
democrats
themselves
would
now
rather
talk
about
jobs
and
health
care
the
conclusion
of
the
investigation
will
not
heal
a
divided
country
before
the
mueller
report
landed
of
americans
thought
the
president
should
be
impeached
according
to
a
poll
of
people
by
the
voter
study
group
that
is
almost
identical
to
the
proportion
of
americans
who
approve
of
the
job
the
president
is
doing
in
the
economist
yougov
poll
one
rule
of
thumb
in
american
politics
in
is
that
nobody
changes
their
mind
and
indeed
post-mueller
the
president's
approval
rating
has
barely
budged
the
faction
that
wants
mr
trump
canonised
and
the
faction
that
wants
him
ejected
from
the
white
house
immediately
remain
about
equal
in
strength
and
they
still
loathe
each
other
mr
trump
at
least
has
cause
to
cheer
for
months
mr
mueller's
investigation
hung
over
his
administration
cable
news
offered
daily
speculation
about
just
how
damaging
it
would
be
for
the
president
he
can
now
point
to
some
of
the
pronouncements
from
former
officials
like
john
brennan
a
former
head
of
the
cia
turned
cable-news
talking-head
who
called
mr
trump
treasonous
and
in
the
pocket
of
putin
as
yet
more
evidence
of
an
incompetent
establishment
set
against
him
in
december
mr
brennan
had
warned
the
president
to
get
ready
for
the
forthcoming
exposure
of
your
malfeasance
corruption
after
mr
barr's
summary
landed
he
sounded
a
bit
sheepish
i
don't
know
if
i
received
bad
information
but
i
think
i
suspected
there
was
more
than
there
actually
was
mr
brennan
told
msnbc
in
the
short
term
then
mr
barr's
summary
is
a
boon
to
mr
trump
the
longer-term
effects
may
be
more
equivocal
while
the
investigation
was
under
way
two
views
of
mr
mueller's
work
prevailed
on
opposite
political
poles
mr
trump
insisted
it
was
a
witch
hunt
that
stemmed
from
democrats
inability
to
accept
that
he
had
defeated
hillary
clinton
and
the
washington
establishment's
disdain
for
his
outsider
status
his
contacts
with
russia
were
unusual
but
he
was
an
unorthodox
politician
guilty
of
nothing
more
than
trying
to
improve
relations
with
a
longtime
adversary
that
view
was
hard
to
square
with
the
indictments
and
seven
guilty
pleas
or
convictions
produced
by
mr
mueller's
digging
but
those
mr
trump
insisted
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
conversely
some
of
mr
trump's
opponents
embraced
mr
mueller
with
a
quasi-religious
zeal
witness
the
mueller-face
earrings
and
mueller
devotional
candles
available
on
etsy
the
e-commerce
equivalent
of
a
hippie
grandmother's
attic
beto
o'rourke
a
presidential
candidate
said
that
mr
trump
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
sought
to
collude
with
the
russian
government
to
undermine
and
influence
our
elections
many
hoped
that
mr
mueller's
digging
would
provide
the
requisite
proof
for
such
sentiments
it
did
not
according
to
mr
barr's
summary
mr
mueller
divided
his
report
into
two
parts
the
first
concerns
russia's
interference
in
the
election
mr
mueller's
probe
did
not
establish
that
members
of
the
trump
campaign
conspired
or
co-ordinated
with
the
russian
government
in
its
election
interference
activities
with
co-ordination
defined
as
an
agreement
tacit
or
express
between
the
trump
campaign
and
the
russian
government
on
election
interference
that
is
good
news
not
just
for
mr
trump
but
for
america
had
mr
mueller
turned
up
evidence
that
the
president
owed
his
election
to
a
conspiracy
with
a
hostile
foreign
power
it
would
have
plunged
the
country
into
crisis
mr
mueller
seems
to
have
found
no
proof
that
mr
trump
or
his
staff
worked
with
russia
in
its
hacking
and
disinformation
efforts
he
did
though
provide
plenty
of
evidence
that
they
welcomed
russia's
efforts
paul
manafort
the
campaign
chairman
shared
confidential
polling
data
with
a
ukrainian
political
consultant
whom
america's
intelligence
agencies
believe
has
links
to
russian
intelligence
roger
stone
who
worked
on
the
initial
stages
of
mr
trump's
campaign
seemed
to
know
that
emails
and
documents
stolen
by
russian
intelligence
would
be
released
at
times
favourable
to
mr
trump
donald
trump
junior
took
a
meeting
with
a
russian
lawyer
offering
dirt
on
mrs
clinton
and
mr
trump
himself
implored
russia
to
hack
into
hillary
clinton's
server
to
find
the
emails
that
are
missing
mr
mueller
may
have
found
more
such
instances
which
is
one
reason
democrats
want
the
full
report
to
be
released
even
if
that
fails
congress
will
continue
to
investigate
mr
trump
mr
mueller
appeared
to
concern
himself
with
whether
members
of
the
campaign
broke
criminal
law
congress
has
a
broader
remit
it
can
investigate
behaviour
it
deems
inimical
to
the
national
interest
even
when
such
behaviour
is
not
criminal
congressional
democrats
should
not
expect
to
find
clear-cut
evidence
that
mr
mueller
missed
but
america
has
traditionally
demanded
more
from
its
presidents
than
simply
not
being
a
criminal
or
an
agent
of
a
foreign
power
the
second
part
of
mr
mueller's
report
concerns
obstruction
of
justice
according
to
mr
barr
mr
mueller
examined
a
number
of
actions
by
the
president
as
potentially
raising
obstruction-of-justice
concerns
these
might
include
mr
trump
firing
james
comey
his
fbi
director
or
his
efforts
to
discredit
the
investigation
or
publicly
attacking
michael
cohen
his
former
lawyer
after
he
pled
guilty
and
implicated
mr
trump
in
a
hush-money
scheme
that
may
have
violated
federal
campaign-finance
law
in
the
end
for
reasons
that
were
foreseen
he
felt
that
he
could
not
recommend
that
mr
trump
be
prosecuted
for
obstructing
justice
see
article
republicans
have
treated
mr
barr's
conclusions
as
dispositive
democrats
they
say
misled
america
for
two
years
that
is
not
quite
right
some
in
the
fever
swamps
drew
unsupported
conclusions
and
made
up
elaborate
theories
that
now
appear
silly
but
mr
trump's
fondness
for
russia
really
is
unusual
and
he
entered
office
under
a
counter-intelligence
investigation
for
his
links
with
russia
that
had
to
be
completed
and
had
the
roles
been
reversed
republicans
would
certainly
have
made
just
as
much
noise
about
it
as
democrats
have
the
investigation's
completion
leaves
mr
trump
emboldened
and
the
presidency
more
powerful
mr
barr's
reasoning
that
the
president
cannot
obstruct
justice
through
the
lawful
exercise
of
his
power
is
now
precedent
future
presidents
will
be
even
less
hesitant
about
using
the
power
of
their
office
to
help
themselves
out
of
legal
trouble
no
sooner
had
mr
barr
issued
his
summary
than
a
political
battle
over
the
complete
release
of
mr
mueller's
report
began
democrats
want
everything
released
except
information
redacted
for
national-security
reasons
hakeem
jeffries
a
member
of
the
house
democratic
leadership
argues
that
compelling
public
interest
can
outweigh
the
need
for
grand-jury
secrecy
democrats
may
also
want
to
see
mr
trump's
written
answers
to
mr
mueller's
questions
which
will
also
be
a
battle
jay
sekulow
one
of
mr
trump's
lawyers
said
those
answers
were
confidential
beyond
the
mueller
report
mr
trump
is
not
out
of
the
woods
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
investigating
him
for
possible
campaign-finance
violations
new
york's
attorney-general
is
probing
allegations
of
bank
and
insurance
fraud
democratic-led
congressional
committees
are
looking
into
a
range
of
misdeeds
including
giving
his
son-in-law
a
security
clearance
despite
serious
vetting
concerns
possible
breaches
of
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
accusations
of
money-laundering
and
entanglements
with
russian
and
saudi
companies
at
the
same
time
democrats
are
eager
to
move
on
mr
mueller's
report
may
prove
a
blessing
in
disguise
because
it
relegates
talk
of
impeachment
to
the
party's
fringes
voters
did
not
much
care
about
the
russia
investigation
and
now
democrats
will
not
have
to
talk
about
it
on
the
campaign
trail
a
poll
from
navigator
research
taken
shortly
after
the
mid-terms
showed
it
was
the
seventh-most
important
issue
for
democratic
voters
the
second-most
important
was
government
corruption
which
those
state
federal
and
congressional
investigations
will
keep
current
the
most
important
was
health
care
toward
which
democrats
are
again
turning
their
attention
on
march
th
they
unveiled
reforms
designed
to
shore
up
the
affordable
care
act
including
an
expansion
of
tax
credits
the
creation
of
a
national
reinsurance
programme
and
an
obligation
for
the
white
house
to
persuade
people
to
sign
up
for
health
insurance
mr
jeffries
accused
republicans
of
launching
an
assault
on
health
care
he
has
found
an
unlikely
ally
in
mr
trump
to
the
consternation
and
surprise
of
many
in
his
own
party
on
march
th
the
justice
department
asked
a
federal
court
to
invalidate
the
affordable
care
act
mr
trump
has
long
been
determined
to
tear
down
the
legacy
of
his
predecessor
but
the
electoral
benefits
of
trying
to
strip
health
insurance
from
millions
of
americans
one
year
before
a
national
election
are
unclear
democrats
conversely
are
eager
to
fight
on
this
ground
with
mr
mueller's
report
finished
they
no
longer
have
to
engage
in
a
fruitless
debate
over
whether
mr
trump
is
treasonous
felon
now
they
can
simply
ask
voters
to
decide
whether
he
is
a
good
president
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's

go
what

expect
from
