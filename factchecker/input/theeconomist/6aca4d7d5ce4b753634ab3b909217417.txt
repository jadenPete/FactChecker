american
voters
don't
care
about
the
economy
if
you're
a
republican
it
looks
great
and
vice
versa
james
carville
who
worked
for
bill
clinton's
presidential
campaign
hung
a
sign
in
his
arkansas
headquarters
in
designed
to
keep
the
candidate
on-message
it
read
change
vs
more
of
the
same
the
economy
stupid
don't
forget
health
care
the
second
injunction
has
become
famous
it
is
common
knowledge
that
a
strong
economy
helps
an
incumbent
whereas
a
weak
one
is
a
liability
but
this
is
less
true
than
it
used
to
be
between
and
when
barack
obama
became
president
the
popularity
of
america's
leaders
was
quite
strongly
influenced
by
the
economy
excluding
the
first
six
months
of
every
president's
term
a
honeymoon
period
when
ratings
tend
to
be
high
a
quarter
of
the
variation
in
monthly
presidential
approval
ratings
could
be
explained
by
variation
in
the
index
of
consumer
sentiment
ronald
reagan
had
an
approval
rating
of
when
americans
were
suffering
under
high
inflation
in
the
summer
of
by
the
time
the
economy
rebounded
four
years
later
his
rating
had
increased
by
percentage
points
under
barack
obama
the
relationship
broke
down
after
the
highs
of
the
first
few
months
his
approval
rating
moved
between
and
the
low
s
americans
felt
much
the
same
about
him
in
good
times
and
in
bad
president
donald
trump
also
seems
stuck
in
the
polls
despite
a
booming
economy
if
the
normal
relationship
between
consumer
confidence
and
popularity
held
about
of
americans
would
approve
of
him
the
latest
gallup
poll
suggests
that
only
do
one
explanation
is
that
partisanship
now
colours
americans
reading
of
the
economy
as
it
colours
their
views
on
many
other
things
polling
on
behalf
of
the
economist
by
yougov
shows
that
republicans
are
four
times
as
optimistic
as
democrats
about
the
state
of
the
stockmarket
which
mr
trump
often
cheers
on
liberals
complain
about
high
housing
costs
and
low
wage
growth
never
mind
that
wages
are
growing
more
strongly
now
than
towards
the
end
of
mr
obama's
term
mr
trump's
election
in
was
followed
by
a
rapid
switch
in
attitudes
from
the
six
months
before
the
election
to
the
six
months
after
yougov
measured
a
percentage-point
increase
in
the
share
of
republican-aligned
americans
who
believed
the
economy
was
getting
better
democrats
became
sharply
more
pessimistic
so
it's
not
any
longer
the
economy
stupid
it's
the
partisanship
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
