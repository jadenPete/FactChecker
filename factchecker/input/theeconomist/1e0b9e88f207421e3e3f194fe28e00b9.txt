the
campaign
will
be
more
racially
divisive
than
was
there
is
method
behind
donald
trump's
go
home
tweets
donald
trump's
bigotry
is
such
an
established
part
of
american
public
discourse
that
in
retrospect
one
of
the
most
febrile
debates
of
looks
naive
back
and
forth
it
went
in
the
months
before
the
election
as
the
republican
candidate
issued
a
slur
against
a
mexican-american
judge
and
for
a
while
refused
to
disavow
the
endorsement
of
a
former
ku
klux
klan
grand
wizard
was
mr
trump
mainly
appealing
to
his
supporters
economic
concerns
in
spite
of
his
chauvinism
or
was
his
race-baiting
really
the
main
draw
the
answer
was
in
long
before
the
president
sent
an
especially
offensive
tweet
this
week
inviting
four
unnamed
but
by
inference
non-white
democratic
congresswomen
to
go
back
to
where
they
came
from
it
was
settled
before
he
refused
to
condemn
the
white
supremacists
of
charlottesville
two
years
ago
the
data
from
his
election
have
been
scrutinised
and
the
resulting
analyses
detailed
in
books
and
papers
are
in
agreement
political
scientists
find
no
clear
economic
rationale
for
mr
trump's
victory
many
states
such
as
georgia
and
maryland
which
had
moved
away
from
the
democrats
in
the
tough
times
of
drifted
back
towards
their
candidate
in
the
better
ones
of
the
millions
of
working-class
whites
whom
mr
trump
recruited
in
rustbelt
states
did
not
buck
that
trend
because
of
economic
anxiety
they
were
no
likelier
to
attribute
their
vote
to
it
than
they
had
been
in
rather
they
were
unified
by
nothing
so
much
as
antipathy
to
america's
growing
diversity
and
an
attendant
feeling
that
whites
were
losing
ground
both
were
expressed
in
hostility
to
immigration
immigrants
and
welfare
spending
which
many
wrongly
believed
was
being
slurped
up
by
migrants
no
doubt
these
feelings
were
exacerbated
by
economic
as
well
as
cultural
and
sometimes
personal
fears
people
are
complicated
and
america
is
changing
these
sentiments
also
predated
mr
trump
yet
they
had
not
been
such
a
big
factor
in
voting
decision-making
until
he
made
them
so
by
drawing
out
his
audience's
inner
grievances
like
a
magnet
tugging
at
a
metal
splinter
in
their
book
identity
crisis
john
sides
michael
tesler
and
lynn
vavreck
describe
the
rationalisation
such
trump
supporters
made
as
racialised
economics
only
a
small
minority
of
voters
hold
old-style
racist
views
on
questions
like
black-white
marriage
but
a
very
large
number
believe
that
undeserving
groups
are
getting
ahead
while
my
group
is
left
behind
an
earlier
study
by
the
voter
study
group
found
hostility
to
immigrants
to
be
the
best
predictor
of
a
trump
voter
one
by
the
public
religion
research
institute
found
much
the
same
there
has
been
no
serious
counter-argument
mr
trump's
race
card
was
the
winning
one
hence
his
inflammatory
comment
this
week
for
while
the
strength
of
the
economy
might
appear
to
have
given
him
a
better
electoral
option
mr
trump
is
intent
on
a
repeat
performance
there
is
no
prospect
of
him
toning
down
his
rhetoric
and
pocketing
the
grateful
majority
of
americans
who
consider
their
personal
finances
to
be
good
or
excellent
the
fact
is
his
behaviour
and
policies
have
already
repelled
a
majority
of
voters
he
wants
the
applause
of
his
adoring
base
too
much
to
change
style
and
his
view
that
america
is
essentially
a
white
country
messed
up
by
escapees
from
non-white
ones
appears
to
be
irrepressible
amid
the
continuing
outrage
his
racist
tweet
stirred
this
week
there
are
three
important
things
to
say
about
this
first
mr
trump's
campaign
will
be
more
racially
divisive
than
it
was
in
when
he
won
white
voters
by
percentage
points
he
was
still
feeling
his
way
then
looking
for
praise
from
the
new
york
times
and
msnbc's
morning
joe
and
when
he
did
ramp
up
the
rhetoric
he
was
criticised
by
republican
leaders
even
as
late
as
charlottesville
his
inflammatory
language
was
repudiated
by
elected
republicans
business
leaders
and
senior
aides
including
his
daughter
ivanka
and
gary
cohn
he
has
received
nothing
like
such
criticism
this
week
moreover
his
slur
against
the
four
congresswomen
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
ilhan
omar
rashida
tlaib
and
ayanna
pressley
of
whom
only
ms
omar
was
born
overseas
and
ms
pressley
is
not
even
of
recent
migrant
stock
merely
black
came
not
from
an
eccentric
candidate
but
the
president
if
mr
trump
only
repeated
his
divisive
lines
next
year
they
would
carry
more
weight
and
he
will
probably
say
worse
because
he
wants
vindication
for
himself
and
his
reviled
method
in
the
event
of
any
setback
he
is
liable
to
double
down
it
might
work
again
too
which
is
the
second
point
mr
trump's
approval
ratings
are
low
but
resilient
and
competitive
set
aside
the
state-level
polling
which
is
less
positive
for
him
and
he
is
only
a
few
points
short
of
the
he
won
in
he
need
not
be
loved
to
make
up
the
difference
he
needs
only
to
make
his
opponent
more
hated
which
was
his
other
ploy
in
this
makes
democratic
voters
whose
early
support
for
joe
biden
suggests
a
demand
for
a
plain-vanilla
moderate
whom
mr
trump
might
find
hard
to
demonise
more
sensible
than
the
party's
left-wing
activists
they
see
in
his
vulnerability
an
opportunity
to
bring
about
a
leftward
shift
that
most
americans
do
not
want
one
plausible
though
possibly
too
ingenious
theory
for
his
attack
on
ms
pressley
and
the
rest
all
of
whom
are
left-wingers
is
that
he
wanted
to
boost
their
prestige
within
the
party
that
may
in
any
event
be
the
result
democrats
must
resist
mr
trump
setting
their
agenda
in
any
way
they
do
not
need
revered
anti-trump
warriors
they
need
to
be
able
to
rebuke
his
divisiveness
smartly
keeping
in
mind
their
own
reputation
for
hyperventilating
the
bill
introduced
by
nancy
pelosi
to
censure
his
tweet
passed
that
test
its
citation
of
a
line
from
ronald
reagan's
last
presidential
address
if
we
ever
closed
the
door
to
new
americans
our
leadership
in
the
world
would
soon
be
lost
also
spoke
to
the
third
point
which
is
the
fundamental
one
mr
trump's
exclusionary
vision
of
america
is
a
travesty
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
