remembering
third-party
presidential
candidate
ross
perot
the
billionaire
had
a
moderating
effect
on
american
politics
sandwiched
between
bill
clinton
and
george
h.w.
bush
on
the
presidential
debate
platform
in
ross
perot
looked
like
a
grizzled
man-child
at
five
feet
five
inches
tall
he
was
almost
a
foot
shorter
than
the
thoroughbred
republican
president
and
democratic
governor
he
had
to
stand
while
they
slouched
on
their
bar
stools
to
look
them
in
the
eye
a
lesser
man
running
in
a
different
year
might
have
appeared
ridiculous
yet
the
texan
billionaire
whose
death
this
week
recalls
one
of
america's
strangest
and
most
fateful
political
careers
thrived
on
the
contrast
america
was
in
the
economic
doldrums
and
after
years
of
republican
rule
aching
for
a
change
that
slick
mr
clinton
was
not
quite
trusted
to
deliver
this
created
an
opportunity
for
an
outsider
that
mr
perot
pint-size
scrappy
and
quivering
with
contempt
for
both
parties
as
well
as
hostility
towards
the
president
a
yankee
interloper
to
his
beloved
state
seized
with
hyperactive
brio
he
had
two
major
policy
impulses
a
phobia
of
debt
on
which
he
blamed
most
of
america's
economic
troubles
and
an
embrace
of
protectionism
you
implement
that
nafta
he
warned
his
opponents
and
you're
going
to
hear
a
giant
sucking
sound
of
jobs
being
pulled
out
of
this
country
but
his
overarching
message
the
basis
for
the
most
successful
third-party
run
in
a
century
was
his
vow
to
tear
into
washington
dc
and
shake
things
up
he
was
not
the
first
to
make
that
promise
indeed
his
pugnacity
recalled
two
of
the
most
successful
third-party
candidates
before
him
theodore
roosevelt
and
george
wallace
yet
as
the
first
billionaire
populist
candidate
mr
perot
had
novel
credentials
and
other
advantages
at
a
time
when
the
downturn
and
bush's
spending
had
raised
doubts
about
the
reaganite
consensus
his
epic
success
as
a
pioneer
of
the
computer-services
industry
suggested
he
might
actually
know
what
to
do
about
the
economy
he
was
also
able
to
cover
his
campaign
costs
he
spent
m
in
he
retained
his
eye
for
economies
though
he
generated
publicity
by
appearing
on
tv
chat-shows
he
announced
his
run
on
larry
king
live
where
his
folksy
sometimes
perplexing
language
life
is
like
a
cobweb
not
an
organisation
chart
and
love
of
high
jinks
made
him
popular
in
he
launched
a
paramilitary
operation
to
spring
two
employees
from
an
iranian
jail
they
were
freed
by
a
mob
not
mr
perot's
daredevilry
but
that
did
not
spoil
the
story
or
the
thriller
by
ken
follett
and
subsequent
tv
miniseries
he
was
a
genius
salesman
and
like
many
men
who
tell
tales
for
a
living
his
grip
on
reality
could
be
strained
he
was
a
sucker
for
conspiracy
theories
his
belief
that
hundreds
of
american
prisoners
of
war
remained
in
vietnamese
jails
was
an
enduring
fantasy
his
company
headquarters
resembled
a
prison
camp
with
barbed-wire
fences
armed
guards
and
strict
dress
and
behavioural
codes
facial
hair
and
short
skirts
were
banned
but
when
an
employee
needed
help
with
a
sick
child
no
expense
was
spared
he
was
a
tycoon
from
another
age
a
paternalist
with
an
eccentric
edge
more
lord
leverhulme
than
bill
gates
that
blend
of
outlandish
achievement
and
disruptive
idiosyncrasy
was
central
to
his
appeal
americans
wanted
to
get
back
to
winning
and
in
the
absence
of
fresh
thinking
from
either
party
were
open
to
suggestions
after
leading
in
early
polling
mr
perot
eventually
persuaded
one
in
five
to
vote
for
him
that
was
despite
his
bizarre
decision
to
call
off
his
campaign
for
two
months
after
the
democratic
convention
because
he
variously
suggested
the
security
of
his
daughter's
wedding
was
threatened
or
he
had
been
blackmailed
or
the
democrats
had
impressed
him
the
similarities
with
another
paranoid
billionaire
populist
are
obvious
james
carville
mr
clinton's
former
strategist
called
mr
perot
john
the
baptist
to
the
disenchanted
displaced
non-college
white
voter
to
whom
donald
trump
appeals
it
really
is
hard
to
imagine
the
president
without
mr
perot
his
protectionist
rhetoric
is
almost
verbatim
yet
the
comparison
shows
too
how
much
has
changed
in
american
politics
mostly
not
for
the
better
it
may
also
more
positively
suggest
how
worse
can
avoided
mr
perot's
success
unlike
mr
trump's
was
based
on
appealing
across
the
parties
a
myth
on
the
right
that
he
cost
bush
the
election
has
been
serially
debunked
that
reflected
the
many
more
independent
voters
who
were
then
available
by
contrast
the
only
way
a
charismatic
independent
could
hope
to
win
power
in
was
by
capturing
one
of
the
party's
nominations
as
mr
trump
did
mr
perot
therefore
pitched
for
votes
in
the
centre
when
not
grandstanding
on
trade
he
offered
heterodox
and
mostly
worthy
ideas
he
backed
higher
spending
on
education
abortion
rights
and
modest
gun
control
as
well
deregulation
and
a
strong
defence
this
made
him
influential
in
both
parties
before
the
advent
of
mr
trump
his
most
enduring
effect
was
to
have
pushed
the
democrats
under
mr
clinton
then
barack
obama
to
embrace
fiscal
restraint
indeed
it
might
not
be
obvious
given
that
the
national
debt
has
almost
doubled
as
a
share
of
output
since
but
they
overlearned
that
lesson
the
obama
administration's
failure
to
apply
a
bigger
stimulus
in
the
depths
of
reflected
its
caution
as
well
as
republican
opposition
that
should
now
serve
as
a
warning
to
both
parties
as
in
an
effort
to
assuage
the
populist
passions
mr
trump
has
aroused
they
rush
to
embrace
mr
perot's
other
more
damaging
big
idea
protectionism
the
anti-establishment
tendency
in
american
politics
its
so-called
paranoid
style
which
mr
perot
and
mr
trump
represent
is
rooted
in
subversive
sentiment
not
policy
ideas
more
spasmodic
than
linear
it
has
always
been
hard
to
manage
but
mostly
short-lived
as
with
cooler
heads
in
both
parties
the
current
outbreak
could
be
if
only
it
could
expire
as
graciously
as
mr
perot
asked
in
his
last
interview
what
he
wanted
to
be
remembered
for
he
said
aw
i
don't
worry
about
that
his
political
legacy
is
a
mixed
bag
yet
his
record
of
good-humoured
public
service
was
great
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
