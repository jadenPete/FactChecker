two
new
members
of

are
accused
of
an
ancient
vice
if
your
enemy's
forces
are

them
since
taking
power
in
january
house
democrats
have
proved
surprisingly
united
discontent
with
nancy
pelosi's
speakership
fizzled
and
the
party
successfully
stared
down
president
donald
trump
over
his
demand
for
bn
for
his
border
wall
but
republicans
believe
they
have
found
an
issue
to
split
their
opponents
israel
and
two
new
congresswomen
rashida
tlaib
and
ilhan
omar
are
making
their
jobs
easier
ms
tlaib
and
ms
omar
are
the
first
two
muslim
women
to
be
elected
to
congress
both
support
boycotting
sanctioning
and
divesting
from
israel
both
have
been
attacked
and
derided
for
their
faith
but
both
have
also
trafficked
wittingly
or
not
in
anti-semitic
tropes
in
january
ms
tlaib
tweeted
that
backers
of
a
bill
that
would
allow
states
to
forgo
doing
business
with
companies
that
boycott
israel
have
forgot
which
country
they
represent
evoking
the
pernicious
myth
of
jewish
dual
loyalty
on
february
th
ms
omar
tweeted
that
american
politicians
defence
of
israel's
government
was
all
about
the
benjamins
from
aipac
the
american
israel
public
affairs
committee
implying
that
they
are
controlled
by
jewish
money
benjamins
being
slang
for
bills
on
which
the
great
benjamin
franklin
appears
ms
omar
apologised
though
stood
by
her
criticism
of
aipac
after
the
house
democratic
leadership
condemned
her
remarks
ms
tlaib
said
her
comments
were
not
aimed
at
jews
ms
omar's
defenders
on
the
left
point
out
that
aipac
is
indeed
a
fairly
effective
lobbying
group
but
there
is
a
difference
between
arguing
that
aipac
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
american
foreign
policy
and
claiming
that
american
support
of
israel
is
all
about
money
from
jewish
lobbyists
americans
from
both
parties
and
many
faiths
reflexively
support
israel's
government
for
a
variety
of
reasons
kevin
mccarthy
the
top-ranking
house
republican
had
already
accused
both
women
of
anti-semitism
ms
omar
for
a
tweet
that
evoked
stereotypes
of
jewish
manipulation
by
saying
that
israel
has
hypnotised
the
world
liz
cheney
chairwoman
of
the
house
republican
conference
urged
democrats
to
remove
ms
omar
from
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
as
has
the
republican
jewish
committee
mr
trump
called
on
her
to
resign
yet
ms
omar
did
not
accuse
michael
bloomberg
tom
steyer
and
george
soros
all
jews
or
of
jewish
extraction
of
trying
to
buy
the
mid-term
elections
as
mr
mccarthy
did
nor
did
ms
tlaib
accuse
a
jewish
audience
of
wanting
to
control
their
politicians
or
release
a
campaign
ad
featuring
three
prominent
jews
mr
soros
lloyd
blankfein
and
janet
yellen
who
control
the
levers
of
power
in
washington
and
don't
have
your
good
in
mind
as
mr
trump
did
in
neither
mr
trump
nor
mr
mccarthy
offered
as
thoughtful
an
apology
for
their
words
as
ms
omar
did
it
makes
political
sense
for
republicans
to
foment
dissent
among
democrats
they
are
more
divided
over
policy
towards
israel
than
republicans
are
but
if
they
were
really
concerned
about
anti-semitism
in
american
politics
they
would
look
to
the
beam
before
the
mote
