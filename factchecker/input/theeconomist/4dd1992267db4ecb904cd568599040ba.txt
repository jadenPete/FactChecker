donald
trump
is
a
pro
wrestler
masquerading
as
commander-in-chief
what
wrestlemania
says
about
the
president
and
american
voters
the
first
time
lexington
thought
of
donald
trump
at
wrestlemania
this
week
was
when
to
the
fading
strains
of
america
the
beautiful
a
helicopter
flyover
churned
the
night
sky
over
the
metlife
stadium
in
new
jersey
was
the
president
about
to
make
a
surprise
reappearance
at
the
annual
wwe
sports-entertainment
extravaganza
to
which
he
owes
so
much
of
his
political
method
the
second
time
well
into
the
seven-hour
grapplefest
was
as
the
veteran
star-wrestler
triple
h
was
ripping
out
his
grudge-rival's
nose-rings
with
a
pair
of
pliers
that
was
not
only
a
reflection
on
how
mr
trump
treats
his
cabinet
paul
levesque
as
triple
h
was
originally
known
these
days
spends
most
of
his
time
as
a
senior
executive
in
the
billion-dollar
wwe
business
having
married
into
the
mcmahon
clan
that
owns
it
in
reality-bending
wwe
style
he
first
married
and
divorced
stephanie
mcmahon
daughter
of
wwe
founder
vince
fictitiously
this
was
part
of
a
story-line
in
which
she
and
her
brother
shane
both
wwe
executives
who
appear
in
wwe
productions
as
villainous
executives
and
wrestlers
tried
to
steal
their
parents
business
triple
h
then
actually
married
and
had
three
children
with
her
those
developments
are
now
part
of
his
wrestling
character
as
triple
h
was
mock-torturing
his
rival
batista
this
week
a
wwe
commentator
broadcasting
live
to
countries
and
one
of
america's
biggest
television
audiences
said
mock-fearfully
that's
my
boss
this
disorienting
mix
of
business
dynasty
and
entertainment
scrambling
performance
and
reality
ham
interests
and
financial
ones
is
the
defining
characteristic
of
professional
wrestling
and
of
its
chief
emulator
the
president
mr
trump
is
another
sometime
wwe
performer
with
close
ties
to
the
mcmahons
a
longtime
fixture
at
wrestlemania
he
launched
a
semi-scripted
assault
on
vince
mcmahon
at
the
version
having
been
inducted
into
the
wwe
hall
of
fame
he
returned
the
favour
by
appointing
vince's
wife
linda
to
his
cabinet
as
head
of
the
small
business
administration
she
will
soon
leave
it
to
run
a
pro-trump
super
pac
yet
such
personal
links
do
not
begin
to
do
justice
to
mr
trump's
stylistic
debt
to
spoof
wrestling
to
appreciate
that
consider
why
it
has
proved
so
alluring
it
is
not
because
fans
think
the
fights
are
real
exactly
testifying
before
the
new
jersey
senate
in
when
the
mcmahons
were
trying
to
evade
regulations
on
competitive
sport
mrs
mcmahon
admitted
they
were
fake
after
this
unprecedented
flouting
of
kayfabe
as
wrestlers
call
their
scripted
reality
some
said
the
industry
was
finished
that
it
has
instead
grown
hugely
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
power
of
escapism
the
wwe
fans
at
the
metlife
typically
young
men
with
defiant
slogans
such
as
i'm
not
dead
yet
muthafucker
on
their
t-shirts
are
the
heroes
of
their
own
imaginations
many
carried
chunky
replicas
of
wwe
fake
championship
belts
it's
like
santa
claus
not
real
but
that's
not
the
point
said
jason
a
banker
from
manhattan
with
a
belt
over
his
shoulder
wwe
has
also
found
new
ways
in
its
scripting
and
use
of
digital
media
to
buttress
the
fantasy
most
important
it
constantly
shifts
between
different
registers
of
make-believe
from
real
to
credible
to
absurd
thus
for
example
its
use
of
executives
as
characters
similarly
its
stars
appear
in
and
out
of
character
on
social
media
in
a
pre-wrestlemania
rant
ronda
rousey
a
former
mixed
martial
arts
champion
slammed
wwe
as
not
real
and
vowed
henceforth
to
do
whatever
the
hell
i
want
such
tricks
create
sufficient
doubt
about
what
is
real
for
wwe
fans
to
keep
living
their
dream
a
blurring
of
the
age-old
distinction
between
faces
and
heels
also
supports
this
shift
towards
realism
triple
h
once
a
heel
is
now
considered
a
good
guy
so
does
the
frenetic
way
wwe
scriptwriters
distract
their
audience
with
new
talking-points
while
it
was
legal
for
triple
h
to
take
a
sledge
hammer
to
batista
did
it
make
sense
given
his
actual
torn
pectoral
muscle
tactically
mr
trump's
success
lies
in
applying
wwe
principles
where
the
line
between
performance
and
reality
is
even
finer
in
the
apprentice
he
played
a
successful
businessman
in
politics
he
saw
that
the
contest
of
ideas
its
participants
claimed
to
be
engaged
in
was
really
a
partisan
slugfest
almost
as
contrived
and
absurd
as
the
wwe
he
therefore
offered
a
more
ghoulishly
watchable
version
of
what
voters
were
already
getting
why
choose
jeb
bush
trying
to
be
a
pantomime
bad-ass
when
you
could
have
the
real
thing
the
president
also
employs
the
wwe's
new
stagecraft
mixing
family
business
and
politics
infuriates
sticklers
for
the
law
but
makes
his
fans
think
he
is
somehow
more
real
or
authentic
than
his
rivals
he
is
also
a
master
of
shifting
between
degrees
of
make-believe
i'm
not
supposed
to
say
this
he
interjects
into
his
speeches
but
what
the
hell
and
then
there
are
his
constantly
distracting
micro-dramas
breathlessly
echoed
by
a
commentariat
every
bit
as
emotionally
invested
in
the
drama
as
the
press
gallery
at
wrestlemania
which
often
erupted
into
spontaneous
gasps
or
applause
how
much
of
mr
trump's
behaviour
is
concocted
is
debatable
private
trump
is
also
pretty
pantomime
but
that
uncertainly
merely
adds
wwe
style
to
the
reality-tumbling
effect
mr
trump's
ham
performance
has
been
endangered
by
its
own
success
represented
by
two
years
of
unified
republican
government
a
wwe
performer
without
an
adversary
would
be
a
pitiful
spectacle
it
is
therefore
testament
to
the
president's
genius
that
he
was
able
to
fill
the
void
not
with
policies
obviously
but
rather
a
parade
of
new
enemies
immigrant
children
black
football
players
the
late
john
mccain
yet
with
the
democrats
soon
to
choose
a
new
champion
his
performance
may
be
about
to
get
easier
his
opponents
should
be
advised
by
this
the
wwe's
popularity
suggests
their
main
hope
that
voters
will
tire
of
mr
trump's
grim
clowning
may
be
wishful
more
specifically
they
should
recognise
that
no
professional
politician
can
beat
him
in
a
grudge
match
they
would
do
better
where
possible
to
ignore
him
china's
pharmaceuticals
industry
is
growing
up
europe's
manufacturing
slowdown
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
where
did
the
reformist
just
re-elected
as
indonesia's
president
go
what
to
expect
from
the
supreme
court's
new
term
