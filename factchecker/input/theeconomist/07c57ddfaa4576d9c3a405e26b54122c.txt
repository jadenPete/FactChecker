we're

a
visitor
from
the
s
marvels
at
the
social
conservatism
on
american
campuses
to
underline
his
theory
that
sexuality
is
a
construct
of
human
discourse
the
philosopher
michel
foucault
noted
that
people
talk
about
sex
a
lot
we
convince
ourselves
that
we
have
never
said
enough
on
the
subject
he
wrote
in
his
four-volume
the
history
of
sexuality
it
is
possible
that
where
sex
is
concerned
the
most
long-winded
the
most
impatient
of
societies
is
our
own
after
a
three-hour
discussion
of
sex
and
dating
with
students

your
columnist
felt
he
knew
why
few
fields
of
human
behaviour
and
none
more
important
are
so
hard
to
explain
lexington's
visit
was
spurred
by
the
latest
evidence
that
young
people
in
america
as
in
japan
and
some
other
rich
countries
are
having
much
less
sex
the
portion
of
americans
aged
to
who
claim
to
have
had
no
sex
for
months
has
more
than
doubled
in
a
decade
to
last
year
that
is
counter-intuitively
despite
the
removal
of
many
impediments
to
sex
young
americans
are
less
religious
and
more
relaxed
about
sexual
orientation
than
they
have
ever
been
they
are
also
readier
to
experiment
in
part
owing
to
the
deluge
of
free
porn
they
receive
on
smartphones
you
have
access
to
the
entire
body
of
porn
in
your
rucksacks

alexandra
solomon
a
clinical
psychologist
who
runs
northwestern's
renowned
marriage
course
in
a
subsequent
lecture
her
comment
elicited
hardly
any
amusement
indeed
the
most
striking
thing
about
the
students
to
lexington
in
effect
a
visitor
from
the
s
was
how
frank
and
unembarrassable
they
seemed
they
were
despite
their
shared
interest
in
studying
sex
at
an
elite
university
a
diverse
crowd
straight
and
gay
black
and
white
outgoing
and
reserved
about
half
were
from
religious
families
a
couple
from
migrant
ones
yet
all
seemed
willing
to
discuss
their
sexual
likes
dislikes
and
anxieties
including
use
of
porn
body
shyness
and
the
possible
role
of
both
in
fuelling
a
millennial
obsession
with
pubic
grooming
to
the
extent
that
they
represented
their
generation
diffidence
about
sex
is
not
the
problem
the
biggest
reasons
for
the
sex
recession
are
probably
straightforward
married
couples
have
more
sex
than
singletons
and
americans
are
marrying
later
economic
duress
is
another
dampener
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
slowdown
in
young
americans
sex
lives
began
during
the
great
recession
partly
as
a
result
of
it
many
of
them
still
live
with
their
parents
and
the
low
esteem
that
poor
prospects
engender
as
the
experience
of
many
japanese
tragically
attests
can
also
cause
mass
celibacy
the
recent
vigour
of
america's
economy
might
make
this
seem
less
relevant
especially
among
high-achievers
like
the
northwestern
students
yet
it
was
striking
how
many
mentioned
the
recession
including
their
memories
of
the
distress
it
caused
their
parents
as
a
reason
to
prioritise
their
careers
even
to
the
extent
of
forgoing
romance
entirely
we're
not
looking
to
get
married
any
more
so
what
are
we
doing
asked
one
woman
but
that
still
does
not
seem
to
explain
the
persistence
of
america's
sex
recession
or
its
most
extreme
feature
how
concentrated
it
is
among
men
since
there
has
been
almost
a
threefold
rise
in
the
share
of
men
under
the
age
of
who
claim
to
be
having
no
sex
at
the
same
time
the
portion
of
sexless
women
increased
by
only
a
range
of
possible
explanations
for
the
disparity
has
been
suggested
and
the
students
seemed
to
corroborate
several
of
them
many
felt
men's
social
skills
had
been
especially
eroded
by
over-reliance
on
technology
overindulgence
in
porn
meanwhile
offered
them
an
escape
route
from
reality
yet
the
most
compelling
answer
because
it
contains
elements
of
all
that
and
more
may
be
signalled
by
young
people's
increasing
reluctance
to
date
this
is
often
blamed
on
the
hook-up
culture
of
college
campuses
yet
casual
sex
and
dating
coexisted
in
the
s
it
is
also
easy
to
exaggerate
now
as
then
how
many
people
are
hooking
up
half
the
northwestern
students
said
they
rarely
or
never
did
yet
they
also
rattled
off
reasons
not
to
date
which
among
the
men
who
would
traditionally
take
the
lead
in
such
encounters
included
uncertainty
about
how
they
were
even
managed
many
considered
the
prospect
of
chatting
someone
up
in
a
bar
not
merely
daunting
but
possibly
offensive
revealing
that
your
intention
in
talking
to
someone
is
sexual
that's
hairy
shuddered
one
man
the
problem
seems
to
be
a
profound
anxiety
about
what
the
other
party
to
a
potential
coupling
might
want
and
expect
the
heavy
stress
that
all
the
students
laid
on
the
importance
of
mutually
agreeing
the
basis
of
any
relationship
at
every
stage
of
its
development
is
probably
both
a
cause
and
effect
of
this
dating
apps
which
around
half
the
students
had
used
can
mitigate
it
at
best
it
is
likely
a
response
to
increased
female
empowerment
the
major
change
in
sexual
politics
and
therefore
further
exacerbated
by
men's
dread
of
a
metoo-style
harassment
charge
in
short
young
american
men
with
rather
poor
interpersonal
skills
currently
face
a
historically
confusing
mating-game
even
as
they
worry
a
lot
about
their
careers
no
wonder
many
are
opting
to
stick
to
their
video
games
this
is
painful
but
it
does
at
least
suggest
that
sexual
relations
are
not
so
much
hitting
the
skids
in
america
as
in
flux
the
forces
that
govern
sexual
behaviour
are
dynamic
who
could
have
predicted
a
little
over
a
decade
ago
when
george
w.
bush
was
splurging
on
abstinence
schemes
that
america
would
soon
see
a
spike
in
celibacy
fuelled
by
economics
technology
female
empowerment
and
perhaps
even
casual
sex
and
that
cocktail
of
circumstances
will
not
last
the
economy
is
strong
the
currents
in
popular
culture
will
shift
and
once
young
americans
become
more
used
to
their
more
equal
gender
relations
they
might
re-embrace
the
degree
of
ambiguity
and
risk
that
romance
entails
that
is
the
hope
at
least
meanwhile
they
might
try
putting
down
their
phones
talking
face
to
face
a
bit
more
and
even
flirting

the
crossfire
