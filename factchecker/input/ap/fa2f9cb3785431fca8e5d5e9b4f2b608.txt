as
ms
emily
she
went
on
to
become
a

rep
clyburn
has
often
remarked
on
his
wife's
steady
influence
on
his
political
decision-making
through
the
years
including
the
notion
he
once
entertained
of
leaving
congress
after
republicans
took
back
the
u.s.
house
following
the
elections
due
to
a
frustration
at
failing
to
get
things
accomplished
emily
clyburn
talked
him
out
of
it
in
part
by
joking
she
didn't
need
him
around
the
house
all
the
time
playing
golf
but
also
telling
him
he
had
way
too
much
left
to
accomplish
as
always
she
was
right
clyburn
said
in
one
by
one
friends
and
colleagues

their
support
to
the
clyburn
family

calling
on
rep

to
turn
to
his
faith

his
time
of
loss

just
like
you
gave
her
to

what
he
needed

you
give
him
what
he
needs

with
her
for
the
rest
of
her
life
