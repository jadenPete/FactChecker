unc
denies
claims
of
bias
in
middle
east
studies
program
the
university
of
north
carolina
is
disputing
the
trump
administration's
accusations
of
bias
in
a
middle
east
studies
program
that
the
school
operates
with
duke
university
in
a
letter
sent
to
the
department
friday
and
obtained
by
the
associated
press
through
a
records
request
on
monday
unc's
research
chief
defends
the
duke-unc
consortium
for
middle
east
studies
saying
it
has
been
a
leader
in
middle
eastern
language
studies
for
years
unc
which
houses
the
consortium
was
responding
to
an
aug
letter
from
the
department
threatening
to
cut
federal
grant
money
the
department
said
the
program
focused
too
much
on
cultural
offerings
and
not
on
language
or
national
security
and
that
it
also
placed
too
much
emphasis
on
the
positive
aspects
of
islam
and
not
other
religions
terry
magnuson
the
school's
vice
chancellor
for
research
said
unc
and
duke
were
the
first
universities
in
the
southeast
to
teach
middle
eastern
languages
on
a
regular
basis
he
said
that
unc
started
offering
arabic
classes
in
and
that
it
now
has
the
nation's
highest
enrollment
in
the
urdu
langauge
and
the
eighth
highest
in
both
arabic
and
turkish
he
rebuffed
the
argument
that
the
consortium
fails
to
provide
adequate
instruction
on
national
security
and
economic
issues
saying
it
hosts
dozens
of
programs
a
year
on
the
topics
sometimes
featuring
former
national
security
officials
from
the
trump
obama
and
bush
administrations
magnuson
also
contested
the
trump
administration's
claim
that
certain
cultural
programs
including
one
on
iranian
art
and
film
should
not
be
supported
with
taxpayer
money
he
said
such
programs
help
improve
language
acquisition
and
attract
new
students
to
the
consortium's
courses
education
secretary
betsy
devos
had
ordered
an
investigation
into
the
program
in
june
following
complaints
of
anti-israel
bias
at
a
conference
hosted
by
the
consortium
critics
said
it
featured
a
rapper
who
performed
an
anti-semitic
song
the
department's
investigation
did
not
directly
take
a
stance
on
any
anti-semitism
but
instead
evaluated
if
the
consortium
was
meeting
rules
tied
to
a
federal
grant
for
language
programs
it
said
the
consortium
was
falling
short
of
the
grant's
goals
and
had
until
sept
to
revise
its
proposal
among
its
findings
the
department
said
the
program
failed
to
provide
a
balance
of
perspectives
on
religion
it
argues
that
the
consortium
promoted
the
positive
aspects
of
islam
but
not
christianity
judaism
or
other
religions
it
also
said
the
consortium
focused
too
much
on
islam
and
failed
to
teach
about
discrimination
faced
by
christians
jews
and
other
religious
minorities
in
the
middle
east
magnuson
countered
that
the
consortium
has
hosted
events
on
the
persecution
of
armenian
christians
and
other
religious
minorities
he
said
a
positive
appreciation
for
christianity
judaism
and
other
religions
suffuses
all
the
programs
in
question
noting
that
the
consortium
has
hosted
events
including
a
visit
to
a
jewish
center
to
explore
jewish
traditions
and
presentations
on
christianity
in
lebanon
academic
freedom
advocates
say
the
department's
letter
amounted
to
ideological
harassment
but
unc
makes
no
such
argument
in
its
letter
magnuson
said
the
school
deeply
values
its
partnership
with
the
department
and
has
always
been
strongly
committed
to
complying
with
the
grant
program
he
said
the
school
will
establish
an
advisory
board
to
review
the
consortium's
activities
and
will
keep
records
detailing
how
all
expenses
relate
to
the
goal
of
the
federal
grant
