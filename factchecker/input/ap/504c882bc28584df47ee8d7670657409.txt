explains
the
delay
in
us
aid
to
ukraine
washington
ap
the
trump
administration's
delayed
release
of
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
is
coming
under
new
scrutiny
in
light
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
about
president
donald
trump
here's
a
look
at
what's
known
about
the
gap
in
u.s.
assistance
help
against
russian
aggression
the
united
states
began
providing
military
aid
to
the
government
of
ukraine
shortly
after
russia
illegally
annexed
ukraine's
crimean
peninsula
in
with
ukraine's
new
president
still
grappling
with
separatist
rebels
in
the
east
the
aid
has
long
been
viewed
as
a
measure
of
washington's
determination
to
push
back
against
russian
president
vladimir
putin
but
over
the
summer
it
emerged
that
the
trump
administration
was
delaying
the
release
of
this
year's
million
installment
it
is
a
decision
cloaked
in
mystery
by
late
august
according
to
congressional
aides
the
white
house
budget
office
acknowledged
it
was
responsible
for
the
delays
saying
a
policy
review
was
underway
the
president
has
been
consulting
with
his
national
security
leadership
team
to
determine
the
best
use
of
ukraine
security
assistance
funds
to
achieve
us
national
security
interests
office
of
management
and
budget
staff
wrote
in
an
email
to
house
appropriations
committee
staff
aides
agencies
omb
said
must
wait
to
obligate
them
until
the
policy
review
process
is
complete
and
the
president
had
made
a
final
determination
omb
declined
to
comment
on
the
record
news
of
the
hold-up
alarmed
ukraine's
many
supporters
in
congress
including
members
of
the
house
and
senate
appropriations
committees
which
were
moving
on
separate
tracks
to
rebuke
the
administration
house
appropriations
committee
chairwoman
nita
lowey
added
a
provision
to
a
house
stopgap
spending
bill
to
ensure
the
ukraine
funds
would
remain
available
after
the
sept
end
of
the
fiscal
year
the
white
house
informed
lawmakers
sept
that
it
was
releasing
the
money
the
struggle
was
resolved
only
a
couple
of
days
after
lawmakers
returned
to
washington
from
their
summer
recess
with
the
administration
releasing
the
funds
why
does
the
delay
matter
the
timing
is
under
scrutiny
by
democrats
suspicious
that
president
donald
trump
may
have
used
the
security
money
as
leverage
in
dealing
with
ukraine's
new
president
voldymyr
zelenskiy
trump
and
his
personal
attorney
rudy
giuliani
have
acknowledged
efforts
to
prod
a
ukrainian
investigation
into
the
business
activities
of
hunter
biden
the
son
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
the
curious
temporary
halt
to
delivery
of
the
ukraine
aid
package
but
there
is
another
possible
explanation
for
the
temporary
suspension
of
aid
at
the
time
ukraine
was
transitioning
to
a
new
democratically-elected
government
and
a
review
of
the
aid
may
have
been
justified
under
such
circumstances
trump
has
repeatedly
said
u.s.
allies
need
to
spend
more
on
their
own
defense
asked
sept
about
ukraine
aid
vice
president
mike
pence
said
he
did
not
raise
the
bidens
at
a
meeting
with
zelenskiy
though
he
stressed
he
told
zelenskiy
that
the
u.s.
government
has
great
concerns
about
issues
of
corruption
to
invest
additional
taxpayer
money
in
ukraine
the
president
wants
to
be
assured
that
those
resources
are
truly
making
their
way
to
the
kind
of
investments
that
will
contribute
to
security
and
stability
in
ukraine
pence
said
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
united
states
has
carried
the
load
on
most
of
the
security
investments
in
ukraine
the
pattern
of
limited
facts
however
has
democrats
and
other
trump
critics
questioning
whether
the
president
pressed
zelenskiy
to
investigate
the
bidens
as
a
way
of
helping
his
own
reelection
bid
what's
next
in
a
monday
letter
to
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
demanded
the
assistance
of
the
senate's
gop
majority
in
getting
answers
about
the
ukrainian
aid
mystery
and
other
facets
of
the
brewing
controversy
involving
trump
and
ukraine
schumer
d-n
y.
asked
for
the
names
of
administration
officials
who
directed
that
million
of
military
aid
to
ukraine
be
delayed
and
request
that
all
records
related
to
this
decision
be
turned
over
to
congress
mcconnell
r-ky
countered
just
hours
later
that
the
senate
intelligence
panel
which
has
a
reputation
for
bipartisanship
especially
between
chairman
richard
burr
r-n
c.
and
top
democrat
mark
warner
of
virginia
is
the
proper
venue
for
any
investigation
noting
that
the
panel
is
working
to
get
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
before
the
committee
i
had
been
personally
pressing
them
to
release
security
assistance
funding
for
several
months
to
ensure
the
united
states
did
not
walk
back
our
important
commitments
to
ukraine
