democrats
increase
qualifying
thresholds
for
november
debate
the
democratic
national
committee
is
increasing
the
polling
and
fundraising
requirements
for
presidential
candidates
to
qualify
for
the
primary
campaign's
fifth
debate
in
november
but
in
a
nod
to
the
potential
for
late-surging
campaigns
the
increases
are
not
as
steep
as
those
from
the
first
and
second
debates
during
the
summer
to
the
third
and
fourth
debates
after
labor
day
the
party's
monday
announcement
comes
as
candidates
make
their
final
fundraising
pushes
to
qualify
for
the
oct
debates
in
ohio
the
requirements
from
debate
to
debate
have
been
heavily
scrutinized
by
candidates
and
party
activists
alike
as
dnc
chairman
tom
perez
juggles
potentially
conflicting
priorities
keeping
a
historically
large
field
from
being
too
unwieldy
for
voters
while
keeping
his
promise
that
everyone
running
would
have
a
fair
shot
to
make
a
case
on
the
national
stage
to
make
the
november
debate
candidates
must
have
at
least
unique
donors
with
at
least
each
in
at
least
states
that's
up
from
donors
with
donors
each
in
at
least
states
for
september
and
october
candidates
also
must
hit
in
at
least
four
national
or
early
state
polls
or
hit
in
two
early
state
polls
that
separate
early
state
threshold
is
a
new
polling
pathway
that
dnc
officials
say
is
meant
to
reward
candidates
who
may
be
generating
enthusiasm
in
states
like
iowa
or
new
hampshire
even
if
similar
support
isn't
registering
in
national
polls
the
dnc
has
not
yet
announced
the
date
or
location
of
the
november
debate
the
changes
are
immaterial
to
the
top
tier
of
candidates
joe
biden
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
a
few
candidates
trailing
behind
them
kamala
harris
pete
buttigieg
beto
o'rourke
also
have
met
or
are
within
striking
distance
of
those
november
marks
but
the
new
rules
represent
another
step
up
that
puts
pressure
on
candidates
teetering
in
the
second
tier
and
below
even
as
the
dnc
conceivably
opens
a
new
path
with
the
early
state
polling
that
could
benefit
underdogs
like
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
and
montana
gov
steve
bullock
both
of
whom
are
focusing
heavily
on
the
first
caucus
state
of
iowa
so
that
could
mean
a
further
culling
from
the
september
debate
that
featured
candidates
eleven
or
candidates
could
qualify
for
october's
debate
that's
already
down
from
the
candidates
who
qualified
in
june
and
july
when
the
qualifications
were
at
their
lowest
candidates
could
make
those
stages
by
hitting
just
in
polls
or
gathering
donors
and
they
didn't
have
to
do
both
perez
doubled
the
marks
for
the
next
two
debates
and
required
that
candidates
hit
both
the
chairman
has
defended
the
moves
throughout
the
campaign
saying
that
campaigns
had
plenty
of
notice
and
that
candidates
who
couldn't
meet
the
qualifications
weren't
building
the
support
necessary
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
next
year
anyway
but
some
longshot
candidates
have
blistered
perez
especially
governors
who
began
the
campaign
without
federal
campaign
accounts
or
national
donor
lists
making
it
harder
to
hit
the
grassroots
donor
marks
even
some
of
the
senators
who
were
able
to
transfer
money
from
their
federal
senate
campaign
accounts
to
sustain
their
initial
months
of
campaigning
said
the
donor
requirements
forced
them
to
spend
heavily
for
online
fundraising
consultants
rather
than
traveling
to
early
states
to
meet
voters
in
person
that
conundrum
already
helped
drive
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
from
the
race
and
sen
cory
booker's
campaign
manager
recently
published
a
memo
saying
he'd
have
to
raise
almost
million
in
a
matter
of
weeks
to
remain
viable
bullock
meanwhile
is
the
only
governor
or
former
governor
remaining
in
the
democratic
campaign
and
he's
qualified
only
for
the
july
debate
so
far
he
and
klobuchar
are
betting
heavily
on
their
moderate
appeal
connecting
with
iowa
caucusgoers
dnc
officials
did
not
name
any
current
candidates
but
gave
a
nod
to
the
iowa-specific
strategy
in
explaining
the
new
avenue
to
the
november
stage
they
pointed
to
previous
candidates
like
jimmy
carter
in
and
rick
santorum
in
both
were
afterthoughts
in
national
polling
in
the
early
fall
ahead
of
winter
voting
but
they'd
started
to
show
significant
movement
in
iowa
carter
won
more
votes
in
iowa
than
any
of
his
competitors
finishing
second
only
to
those
voting
uncommitted
he
went
on
to
win
the
nomination
and
the
presidency
santorum
edged
national
favorite
mitt
romney
in
the
gop
iowa
caucus
in
and
he
went
on
to
be
the
last
challenger
standing
before
romney
secured
the
nomination
