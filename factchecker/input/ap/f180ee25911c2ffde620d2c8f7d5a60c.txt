gov
jerry
brown
sees
a
way
to
bring
together
the
world's
largest
carbon
emitter
and
a
u.s.
state
that's
leading
the
way
in
energy
standards
climate
change
brown
and
xie
zhenhua
china's
top
climate
official
announced
a
new
university
partnership
focused
on
climate
research
and
policy
on
monday
as
part
of
the
united
nations
climate
action
summit
in
new
york
while
it
may
seem
like
an
unlikely
pairing
brown
has
been
building
a
partnership
with
china
for
years
and
china
which
emits
the
most
carbon
of
any
nation
has
been
investing
aggressively
in
renewable
energy
products
such
as
battery
storage
technology
and
reducing
its
reliance
on
coal
california
meanwhile
has
adopted
some
of
the
nation's
most
aggressive
climate
goals
including
an
effort
to
use
clean
energy
for
electricity
by
the
partnership
comes
amid
republican
president
donald
trump's
hostile
relationship
with
china
and
his
withdrawal
of
the
united
states
from
global
commitments
to
combat
rising
temperatures
trump
only
briefly
stopped
by
the
climate
summit
before
going
to
an
event
on
religious
freedom
our
goal
is
to
keep
an
open
door
of
constructive
conversation
at
the
very
moment
when
doors
are
closing
brown
a
democrat
who
left
office
in
told
the
associated
press
in
a
recent
interview
zhenhua
will
be
in
new
york
for
the
announcement
while
brown
planned
to
participate
in
discussions
remotely
from
california
california
under
brown
and
now
gov
gavin
newsom
a
fellow
democrat
has
sued
the
trump
administration
repeatedly
over
its
rollback
of
environmental
and
clean
air
regulations
brown
began
developing
partnerships
with
china
on
climate
during
his
governorship
with
trips
to
the
asian
nation
in
and
the
california-china
climate
institute
will
be
housed
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
and
work
in
partnership
with
tsinghua
university
in
beijing
while
china
is
prioritizing
fighting
global
warming
at
home
it's
also
investing
in
dirtier
energy
methods
such
as
coal
in
other
countries
as
it
looks
to
expand
its
global
influence
through
its
belt
and
road
infrastructure
initiative
still
brown
said
california
shouldn't
shy
away
from
opportunities
to
work
with
china
saying
a
research
partnership
will
be
beneficial
to
both
china
for
example
could
teach
california
more
about
its
research
on
battery
storage
brown
said
one
thing
i
think
is
important
and
still
available
for
further
development
is
our
climate
partnership
brown
said
that's
something
trump
can't
do
because
he
has
sworn
climate
denial
and
therefore
he
is
awol
on
one
of
the
most
important
challenges
facing
world
leaders
brown
noted
both
california
and
china
are
focused
on
tightening
emissions
of
pollutants
from
cars
and
trucks
the
trump
administration
last
week
revoked
california's
decades-old
ability
to
set
its
own
standards
but
california
is
punching
back
they
know
it's
the
future
and
they
also
know
the
biggest
market
in
the
world
will
be
following
similar
and
increasingly
more
difficult
emissions
standards
brown
said
speaking
of
china
for
trump
to
attempt
to
create
an
island
of
gas-guzzling
inefficiency
in
a
sea
of
increasingly
efficient
zero-emission
cars
is
insanity
alice
hill
a
senior
fellow
for
climate
change
policy
at
the
council
on
foreign
relations
said
china
has
led
in
finding
new
ways
to
deal
with
the
challenges
from
climate
change-related
floods
she
called
china
an
important
partner
for
the
united
states
on
climate
change
even
amid
concerns
about
intellectual
property
theft
by
china
you
have
to
walk
into
this
with
open
eyes
but
that
does
not
mean
you
may
not
have
a
relationship
hill
said
the
institute
will
invest
in
research
on
zero-emission
vehicles
and
low-carbon
transportation
carbon
pricing
climate
adaptation
sustainable
land
use
and
agriculture
carbon
capture
and
storage
and
long-term
climate
policy
enforcement
through
the
partnership
california
and
china
will
share
best
practices
on
how
to
scale
innovative
climate
solutions
it
will
also
train
researchers
and
scientists
from
both
places
and
host
a
series
of
subnational
climate
dialogues
with
business
government
and
climate
leaders
in
the
united
states
and
china
the
two
nations
held
a
similar
discussion
at
the
global
climate
action
summit
that
brown
hosted
last
year
in
san
francisco
china's
national
and
provincial
governments
as
well
as
california's
public
utilities
commission
air
resources
board
and
other
key
climate
decision
makers
will
work
with
the
institute
asked
if
it
was
problematic
for
a
state
to
team
up
with
a
foreign
country
brown
said
we're
not
negotiating
any
treaties
we're
not
making
foreign
policy
we're
working
on
climate
policy
global
climate
policy
and
as
free
people
we
are
able
to
do
that
former
vice
president
al
gore
and
washington
gov
jay
inslee
who
have
been
vocal
proponents
of
tackling
climate
change
are
expected
at
the
announcement
inslee
who
recently
ended
his
bid
for
the
democratic
nomination
for
president
teamed
up
with
brown
on
some
climate
efforts
while
brown
was
governor
