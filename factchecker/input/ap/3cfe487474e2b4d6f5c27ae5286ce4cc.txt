trump
heads
to
un
with
long
list
of
deals
he's
yet
to
close
washington
ap
president
donald
trump
a
self-described
deal-maker
is
saddled
with
a
long
list
of
unresolved
foreign
policy
deals
he
has
yet
to
close
heading
into
his
u.n.
visit
this
coming
week
there
are
challenges
with
iran
north
korea
the
afghan
taliban
israel
and
the
palestinians
not
to
mention
a
number
of
trade
pacts
some
are
inching
forward
some
have
stalled
trump
has
said
repeatedly
that
he
is
in
no
rush
to
wrap
up
the
deals
but
negotiations
take
time
he
is
nearly
three
years
into
his
presidency
and
the
election
looms
which
will
crimp
his
ability
to
tend
to
unfinished
foreign
business
i
don't
blame
the
president
for
having
so
many
deals
open
said
nicholas
burns
a
former
undersecretary
of
state
who
has
worked
for
republican
and
democratic
presidents
he
gives
trump
credit
for
going
after
china
on
its
trade
practices
and
talking
to
the
taliban
to
try
to
end
years
of
war
in
afghanistan
but
i
do
think
you
have
to
be
tough-minded
as
citizens
and
grade
him
burns
said
how's
he
doing
well
in
my
book
he
doesn't
have
a
single
major
foreign
policy
achievement
in
more
than
years
in
office
trump's
critics
say
that
lack
of
success
means
the
president
is
going
to
the
united
nations
in
a
weakened
position
some
foreign
policy
experts
give
trump
credit
for
opening
up
international
negotiations
yet
there
is
plentiful
criticism
of
his
brash
negotiating
style
blasting
foreign
leaders
one
day
making
nice
the
next
because
they
think
it
makes
the
global
chessboard
more
wobbly
in
his
defense
trump
says
it's
the
way
i
negotiate
it's
done
very
well
for
me
over
the
years
and
it's
doing
even
better
for
the
country
trump's
america
first
mantra
hasn't
gone
over
well
at
the
united
nations
before
now
as
tensions
escalate
between
the
u.s.
and
iran
the
president
needs
international
support
to
help
put
pressure
on
tehran
ever
since
trump
pulled
the
u.s.
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
reinstated
crippling
economic
sanctions
iran
has
lashed
out
iran
downed
an
american
drone
has
impounded
ships
in
the
persian
gulf
and
is
being
blamed
for
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
he's
argued
in
the
past
that
each
country
should
act
solely
in
its
own
interest
and
he's
argued
that
american
might
combined
with
his
negotiating
skill
would
build
u.s.
power
said
jon
alterman
middle
east
program
director
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
now
we
have
a
general
assembly
meeting
where
the
president
really
needs
allies
on
iran
the
prospect
of
trump
talking
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
on
the
sidelines
of
the
u.n.
general
assembly
has
evaporated
alterman
said
the
best-case
scenario
of
another
negotiation
with
iran
would
be
one
leading
to
the
end
of
tehran's
destabilizing
activities
in
the
mideast
new
limits
on
its
nuclear
program
and
greater
visibility
into
its
missile
program
the
worst-case
scenario
he
said
is
that
the
president
alienates
his
allies
and
iran
carries
out
more
attacks
on
u.s.
interests
and
allies
former
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
who
was
fired
by
trump
told
a
group
at
harvard
university
recently
that
successful
negotiations
occur
when
both
parties
leave
with
an
acceptable
outcome
in
a
comment
seemingly
aimed
at
trump
tillerson
said
if
you
ever
think
about
a
negotiation
as
a
win
lose
you're
going
to
have
a
terrible
experience
you're
going
to
be
very
dissatisfied
and
not
very
many
people
are
going
to
want
to
deal
with
you
trump's
other
disarmament
talks
with
north
korea
have
hit
a
wall
too
trump's
initial
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
in
singapore
was
a
first
as
was
trump's
historic
step
inside
north
korea
at
the
demilitarized
zone
dividing
north
and
south
korea
still
the
u.s.
and
north
korea
have
failed
to
gain
traction
on
nuclear
talks
negotiations
to
get
kim
to
give
up
his
nuclear
weapons
have
been
stalled
since
a
february
summit
in
hanoi
which
collapsed
over
disagreement
about
sanctions
relief
in
exchange
for
disarmament
measures
on
friday
trump
claimed
that
his
three-year
relationship
with
kim
is
the
best
thing
that's
happened
to
the
united
states
we'll
see
what
happens
trump
added
it
might
work
out
it
might
not
work
out
but
trump
stressed
that
since
they
started
talking
kim
has
not
conducted
nuclear
tests
and
has
only
fired
short-range
not
long-range
missiles
trump's
mideast
peace
negotiations
also
have
no
momentum
the
administration's
long-awaited
peace
plan
developed
by
trump
son-in-law
and
adviser
jared
kushner
has
not
come
out
and
the
path
forward
is
unclear
tentative
plans
to
release
the
proposal
had
been
scrapped
at
least
twice
the
plan
already
is
facing
rejection
by
the
palestinians
who
cut
off
ties
with
the
administration
after
trump
recognized
jerusalem
as
israel's
capital
the
palestinians
have
accused
his
administration
of
losing
its
standing
as
an
honest
broker
by
repeatedly
siding
with
israel
and
then
there
is
the
long-running
conflict
in
afghanistan
while
trump
has
public
backing
to
end
the
war
he
just
cut
off
nearly
a
year
of
u.s.
talks
with
the
taliban
he
said
the
taliban
were
ramping
up
violence
to
gain
leverage
in
the
negotiations
they
made
a
mistake
trump
said
friday
i
was
totally
willing
to
have
a
meeting
trump
has
the
public's
support
for
withdrawing
u.s.
troops
but
he
was
harshly
criticized
for
planning
to
host
the
taliban
at
the
camp
david
presidential
retreat
just
before
the
anniversary
of
the
sept
attacks
the
taliban
were
harboring
al-qaida
when
al-qaida
orchestrated
trump
biographer
michael
d'antonio
said
that
where
international
affairs
are
concerned
the
president
appears
more
interested
having
something
showy
to
announce
than
in
long-term
problem-solving
once
he
has
a
partner
engaged
he'll
likely
announce
something
that
sounds
important
d'antonio
said
others
will
clean
up
the
details
after
the
election
