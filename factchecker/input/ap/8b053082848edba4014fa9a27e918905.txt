france
and
germany
joined
the
united
states
on
monday
in
blaming
iran
for
attacks
on
key
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
but
the
iranian
foreign
minister
pointed
to
claims
of
responsibility
by
yemeni
rebels
and
said
if
iran
were
behind
this
attack
nothing
would
have
been
left
of
this
refinery
fallout
from
the
sept
attacks
is
still
reverberating
as
world
leaders
gather
for
their
annual
meeting
at
the
u.n.
general
assembly
and
international
experts
investigate
at
saudi
arabia's
request
what
happened
and
who
was
responsible
the
leaders
of
the
united
kingdom
france
and
germany
released
a
statement
reaffirming
their
support
for
the
iran
nuclear
deal
which
the
u.s.
exited
but
telling
iran
to
stop
breaching
it
and
saying
there
is
no
other
plausible
explanation
than
that
iran
bears
responsibility
for
this
attack
they
pledged
to
try
to
ease
tensions
in
the
middle
east
and
urged
iran
to
refrain
from
choosing
provocation
and
escalation
british
prime
minister
boris
johnson
said
late
sunday
while
flying
to
new
york
that
the
u.k.
would
consider
taking
part
in
a
u.s.
led
military
effort
to
bolster
saudi
arabia's
defenses
after
the
drone
and
cruise
missile
attacks
on
the
world's
largest
oil
processor
and
an
oil
field
iran's
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
denied
any
part
in
the
attacks
he
said
monday
that
yemen's
houthi
rebels
who
claimed
responsibility
have
every
reason
to
retaliate
for
the
saudi-led
coalition's
aerial
attacks
on
their
country
he
also
stressed
that
on
the
eve
of
president
hassan
rouhani's
visit
to
the
united
nations
in
new
york
city
it
would
be
stupid
for
iran
to
engage
in
such
activity
zarif
called
it
an
attack
with
high
precision
low
impact
and
no
casualties
in
the
refinery
there
were
facilities
that
would
have
taken
the
saudis
a
year
to
repair
he
said
why
did
they
hit
the
lowest
impact
places
zarif
asked
saying
if
iran
was
responsible
the
refinery
would
have
been
destroyed
france
has
been
trying
to
find
a
diplomatic
solution
to
u.s.
iranian
tensions
which
soared
after
the
saudi
attacks
and
has
carefully
avoided
assigning
blame
earlier
on
his
way
to
new
york
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
he
remained
cautious
about
attributing
responsibility
for
the
attacks
there
was
no
immediate
explanation
of
why
he
later
shifted
positions
and
blamed
iran
macron
said
at
a
u.n.
news
conference
not
long
before
the
statement
was
issued
that
he
planned
to
meet
separately
with
both
trump
and
rouhani
over
the
next
day
and
would
work
to
foster
the
conditions
for
discussion
and
not
escalation
macron
called
the
sept
strikes
a
game-changer
clearly
but
reiterated
france's
willingness
to
mediate
zarif
however
ruled
out
any
iran-u
s.
meeting
he
said
iran
had
received
no
request
from
the
u.s.
and
we
have
made
clear
that
a
request
alone
will
not
do
the
job
he
said
trump
closed
the
door
to
negotiations
with
the
latest
u.s.
sanctions
which
labeled
the
country's
central
bank
a
global
terrorist
institution
a
designation
the
iranian
minister
said
the
u.s.
president
and
his
successors
may
not
be
able
to
change
i
know
that
president
trump
did
not
want
to
do
that
i
know
he
must
have
been
misinformed
zarif
said
in
a
meeting
with
u.n.
correspondents
zarif
said
he
plans
to
meet
wednesday
with
ministers
of
all
five
countries
remaining
in
the
nuclear
deal
from
which
trump
withdrew
including
russia
and
china
johnson
the
u.k.
prime
minister
said
britain
still
backs
the
existing
nuclear
agreement
and
wants
iran
to
stick
to
its
terms
but
urged
trump
to
strike
a
new
deal
with
iran
whatever
your
objections
with
the
old
nuclear
deal
with
iran
it's
time
now
to
move
forward
and
do
a
new
deal
he
said
asked
about
johnson's
suggestion
trump
said
he
respects
the
british
leader
and
believes
the
current
agreement
expires
too
soon
the
joint
u.k.
france
germany
statement
urges
iran
to
reverse
its
rollback
on
key
provisions
in
the
nuclear
deal
and
calls
for
a
new
agreement
the
time
has
come
for
iran
to
accept
negotiation
on
a
long-term
framework
for
its
nuclear
program
as
well
as
on
issues
related
to
regional
security
including
its
missiles
program
and
other
means
of
delivery
the
three
countries
said
shortly
before
leaving
for
the
u.n.
meetings
monday
iran's
rouhani
said
on
state
television
that
his
country
will
invite
persian
gulf
nations
to
join
an
iranian-led
coalition
to
guarantee
the
region's
security
rouhani
said
the
plan
also
encompasses
economic
cooperation
and
an
initiative
for
long
term
peace
he
planned
on
presenting
details
while
at
the
united
nations
zarif
said
the
new
hormuz
peace
initiative
with
the
acronym
hope
would
be
formed
under
a
u.n.
umbrella
with
two
underlying
principles
nonaggression
and
noninterference
he
said
it
would
require
a
major
shift
from
countries
buying
security
from
other
nations
or
mercenaries
and
instead
promote
the
notion
that
you
can
gain
security
relying
on
your
own
people
and
working
with
your
neighbors
johnson
said
he
would
meet
rouhani
at
this
week's
u.n.
gathering
he
said
he
wanted
britain
to
be
a
bridge
between
our
european
friends
and
the
americans
when
it
comes
to
the
crisis
in
the
gulf
johnson
stressed
the
need
for
a
diplomatic
response
to
the
gulf
tensions
but
said
britain
would
consider
any
request
for
military
help
the
trump
administration
announced
friday
that
it
would
send
additional
u.s.
troops
and
missile
defense
equipment
to
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
as
part
of
a
defensive
deployment
officials
said
the
number
of
troops
was
likely
to
be
in
the
hundreds
we
will
be
following
that
very
closely
johnson
said
and
clearly
if
we
are
asked
either
by
the
saudis
or
by
the
americans
to
have
a
role
then
we
will
consider
in
what
way
we
could
be
useful
a
u.k.
official
told
the
associated
press
that
a
claim
of
responsibility
for
the
attacks
by
iran-allied
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
was
implausible
he
said
remnants
of
iran-made
cruise
missiles
were
found
at
the
attack
site
and
the
sophistication
points
very
very
firmly
to
iranian
involvement
the
official
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
intelligence
findings
did
not
say
whether
britain
believed
the
attack
was
launched
from
iranian
soil
iran
denies
responsibility
and
has
warned
any
retaliatory
attack
targeting
it
will
result
in
an
all-out
war
meanwhile
monday
iranian
government
spokesman
ali
rabiei
suggested
the
release
of
a
british-flagged
oil
tanker
held
by
tehran
since
july
would
be
imminent

doesn't
