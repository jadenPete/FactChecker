washington

while
many
democrats
are
focused
on
winning
back
several
rust
belt
states
that
backed
president
donald
trump
in
a
progressive
group
plans
to
spend
million
to
make
sure
the
party
doesn't
overlook
opportunities
in
the
sun
belt
the
group
way
to
win
will
focus
much
of
their
effort
on
helping
democrats
in
states
including
georgia
arizona
texas
florida
virginia
and
north
carolina
where
the
party
hopes
to
make
inroads
with
people
of
color
women
and
young
people
the
group's
leaders
will
outline
their
plans
at
a
donor
retreat
in
arizona
on
monday
an
advance
copy
of
their
blueprint
provided
to
the
associated
press
details
an
effort
focused
less
on
top-level
races
than
building
infrastructure
that
could
help
up
and
down
the
ballot
and
for
years
to
come
it's
preparing
to
win
not
just
in
but
to
build
power
in
the
long
term
said
tory
gavito
who
is
president
and
co-founder
of
way
to
win
which
was
founded
after
president
donald
trump's
win
their
task
will
be
difficult
to
achieve
democrats
haven't
carried
some
of
these
states
at
the
presidential
level
in
decades
and
have
had
only
limited
success
in
statewide
races
in
some
places
the
party's
organization
is
suffering
from
years
of
neglect
as
republicans
have
solidified
their
grip
on
power
but
way
to
win
says
trump's
unconventional
re-election
strategy
which
is
focused
on
driving
turnout
among
those
who
support
him
but
don't
often
vote
adds
a
degree
of
unpredictability
that
means
democrats
can't
take
any
state
for
granted
it's
a
threat
gavito
said
is
a
race
to
drive
up
the
most
new
voters
possible
our
job
is
driving
forward
the
new
electorate
in
the
south
and
southwest
florida
offers
a
cautionary
tale
group
leaders
say
the
state
is
a
perennial
battleground
but
republicans
have
consistently
held
power
in
recent
years
gavito
says
that's
because
national
democrats
have
historically
rolled
in
spent
big
on
tv
advertising
during
marquee
races
but
left
behind
an
infrastructure
that
atrophies
in
the
off-years
they
have
millions
of
young
people
and
people
of
color
sitting
on
the
sidelines
because
it's
an
every
four-to-two-year
proposition
she
said
that
not
community

that
doesn't
create
your
base
for
the
long-term
the
group
presents
itself
as
a
progressive
alternative
to
established
democratic
organizations
and
is
largely
funded
by
a
network

women

a

but
most
of
their
work
is
done
through
two
nonprofit

that

not

during
the
midterms
way

spent
million
and
partnered
with
existing
organizations
in
its
targeted
states
the
belief
they
say
is
that
local
organizations
know
their
communities
best
and
can
help
target
people
who
have
been
overlooked
for
years
democrats
have
talked
up
the
opportunity
presented
by
population
shifts
in
southern
states
though
success
has
often
been
elusive
a
once-in-decade
redistricting
that
will
follow
the
census
offers
a
chance
to
make
inroads
so
long
as
democrats
are
able
to
gain
more
power
in
legislatures
which
are
typically

the

of

white
according
to

arizona
georgia
north

and
texas
have
a
higher
share
of
minorities
than
those
midwestern
states
faster
growing
they've
attracted
younger
and
more
educated
people
from
other
parts
of
the
country
and
enjoy
booming
economies
while
the
rust
belt
states
are
managing
aging
populations
and
declining
industrial
towns
that
offers
an
opportunity
supporting
grassroots
organizations
that
are
there
all
the
time
and
focusing
giving
on
states
that
in
the
past
have
been
ignored
is
important
