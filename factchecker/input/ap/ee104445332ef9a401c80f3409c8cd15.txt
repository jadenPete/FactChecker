columbus

ap
the
republican
national
committee
is
putting
a
college
twist
on
its
grassroots
voter
registration
efforts
seeking
to
mobilize
president
donald
trump's
supporters
the
make
campus
great
again
initiative
is
offering
dozens
of
participants
training
and
free
pizza
plus
swag
like
campaign
buttons
and
drink
insulators
to
distribute
it
started
with
trainings
at
four
schools
in
ohio
last
week
organizers
describe
it
as
a
national
effort
with
similar
swing
state
training
sessions
already
held
or
planned
for
the
university
of
wisconsin-madison
the
university
of
denver
and
college
republicans
in
michigan
it's
aimed
at
building
on
young
voters
enthusiasm
and
higher-than-usual
turnout
in
last
year's
midterm
election
and
pushing
back
against
any
stifling
of
conservative
voices
in
campus
environments
said
mandi
merritt
a
regional
spokeswoman
for
the
trump-rnc
reelection
effort
it
serves
as
a
way
to
bring
conservative
supporters
out
of
the
shadows
of
college
campuses
and
show
that
they
have
a
home
in
the
republican
movement
merritt
said
in
the
midterms
of
voters
ages
to
voted
for
democratic
house
candidates
according
to
ap
votecast
which
surveyed
voters
in
last
year's
election
just
voted
for
republicans
the
outreach
and
mobilizing
also
show
how
the
gop
is
enlisting
the
youngest
voters
in
its
field
operations
and
fighting
for
republican
votes
outside
the
party's
base
in
a
demographic
that
favored
democrats
by
significant
margins
in
recent
elections
said
university
of
cincinnati
political
scientist
david
niven
if
you
think
the
election
is
going
to
be
close
this
is
the
margin
of
victory
niven
said
this
is
the
difference
that
helps
you
get
over
the
top
they
are
proclaiming
this
is
a
state
we
need
to
fight
for
in
akron
which
last
week
had
the
first
make
campus
great
again
session
for
more
than
students
from
several
northeastern
ohio
universities
junior
brooke
bihlman
said
she
and
fellow
members
of
the
university
of
akron
college
republicans
will
be
talking
with
students
between
classes
and
going
door-to-door
on
weekends
in
a
friendly
competition
with
their
democratic
counterparts
on
campus
to
see
who
can
register
the
most
voters
i
think
everyone
in
the
club
right
now
is
just
feeling
very
excited
about
the
future
and
what
we
can
do
to
help
said
bihlman
seeing
hard
work
pay
off
is
obviously
something
that
keeps
a
lot
of
us
going
so
it
starts
with
the
little
stuff
right
now
persuading
peers
to
actually
cast
ballots
might
be
tougher
eighteen-to-
year-olds
typically
have
a
much
lower
turnout
rate
than
older
voters
a
point
noted
by
some
of
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
already
organizing
heavily
on
campuses
in
iowa
which
has
the
first
caucuses
support
from
young
voters
helped
propel
democrat
barack
obama
to
victory
in
and
and
they
heavily
favored
hillary
clinton
over
trump
in
this
time
around
young
republicans
touting
trump
to
their
classmates
point
to
a
promising
job
market
with
the
u.s.
unemployment
rate
near
a
year
low
and
to
the
president's
executive
order
earlier
this
year
that
required
u.s.
colleges
to
protect
free
speech
on
their
campuses
or
risk
losing
federal
research
funding
even
for
a
generation
saturated
in
social
media
there
is
no
replacement
for
talking
about
the
issues
and
candidates
face-to-face
with
potential
voters
said
seth
koellner
a
kent
state
university
junior
who
leads
the
ohio
college
republican
federation
it's
different
than
someone
just
scrolling
past
a
post
on
twitter
he
said
so
it
really
grabs
someone's
attention
and
will
cause
them
to
actually
think
about
what
your
message
is
