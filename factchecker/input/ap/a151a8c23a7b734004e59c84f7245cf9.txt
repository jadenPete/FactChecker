in
which
he
pressured
the
eastern
european
nation's
leader
to
investigate
the
family
of

among
the
countries
that

put
up
money
the
matter
which
is
now
part
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
has
sparked
questions
about
whether
the
president
improperly
used
his
office
to
pressure
a
foreign
country
to
help
his
own
reelection
prospects
democrats
are
demanding
more
information
about
the
whistleblower's
allegations
and
more
than
a
dozen
have
for
the
first
time
raised
the
prospect
of
impeaching
the
president
they
include
a
group
of
moderate
house
freshmen
in
competitive
districts
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
who
has
resisted
calls
for
impeachment
proceedings
for
months
was
huddling
with
her
caucus
in
a
closed-door
meeting
tuesday
afternoon
pelosi
and
her
leadership
team
on
the
various
oversight
committees
are
considering
bringing
forward
a
resolution
that
would
put
the
house
on
the
record
on
this
matter
according
to
a
democratic
leadership
aide
who
was
granted
anonymity
to
discuss
the
private
talks
that
resolution
could
come
as
soon
as
wednesday
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
said
he
would
seek
a
vote
tuesday
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
on
a
resolution
calling
for
the
trump
administration
to
provide
congress
with
the
whistleblower's
government
complaint
at
issue
is
a
summer
phone
call
with
ukraine
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
in
which
trump
is
said
to
have
pushed
for
investigations
into
biden
and
his
son
in
the
days
before
that
call
trump
ordered
that
aid
to
ukraine
be
frozen
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
but
not
authorized
to
discuss
private
conversations
they
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
trump
has
insisted
he
did
nothing
wrong
and
has
denied
that
any
requests
for
help
in
procuring
damaging
information
about
the
bidens
were
tied
to
the
aid
freeze
former
vice
president
joe
biden
is
among
the
leading
candidates
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
trump
has
sought
without
evidence
to
implicate
biden
and
his
son
hunter
in
the
kind
of
corruption
that
has
long
plagued
ukraine
hunter
biden
served
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
at
the
same
time
his
father
was
leading
the
obama
administration's
diplomatic
dealings
with
kyiv
though
the
timing
raised
concerns
among
anti-corruption
advocates
there
has
been
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
either
the
former
vice
president
or
his
son
the
united
states
began
providing
military
aid
to
the
government
of
ukraine
shortly
after
russia
illegally
annexed
ukraine's
crimean
peninsula
in
with
ukraine's
new
president
still
grappling
with
separatist
rebels
in
the
east
the
aid
has
long
been
viewed
as
a
measure
of
washington's
determination
to
push
back
against
russian
president
vladimir
putin
democrats
and
some
republicans
have
urged
the
white
house
to
be
open
about
trump's
actions
but
with
no
new
information
from
the
administration
forthcoming
more
than
a
dozen
democrats
including
some
in
house
leadership
added
their
names
to
those
calling
for
impeachment
proceedings
seven
house
freshmen
who
include
a
former
navy
pilot
soldiers
officers
and
intelligence
analysts
wrote
in
a
joint
op-ed
that
the
allegations
against
trump
are
stunning
both
in
the
national
security
threat
they
pose
and
the
potential
corruption
they
represent
if
true
they
represent
an
impeachable
offense
the
lawmakers
said
these
new
allegations
are
a
threat
to
all
we
have
sworn
to
protect
we
must
preserve
the
checks
and
balances
envisioned
by
the
founders
and
restore
the
trust
of
the
american
people
in
our
government
and
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do

house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
has
declared
that
his

is
already
conducting
impeachment
hearings
but
the
committee
has
been
unable
to
get
many
key
witnesses
and
documents
from
the
trump
administration
one
idea
that
was
being
discussed
among
some
democrats
was
the
possibility
of
a
select
committee
that
could
handle
impeachment
hearings
virginia

abigail
spanberger
a
former
cia
agent
and
one
of
the
freshman
democrats
who
came
out
for
impeachment
proceedings
on
monday
said
the
notion
of
a
select
committee
is
likely
a
good
one
as
long
as
it
remains
bipartisan
we
should
all
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
allegations
and
know
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
our
president
is
either
innocent
or
he's
not
spanberger
