were
there
all
the
way
back
in
biden

referring
to
his
first

for
senate

which
president

is
one

of
former
gov
ed
rendell's
network
david
l.
cohen
who
hosted
biden's
kickoff
fundraiser
at
his
home
in
april
was
a
primary
host
of
the
event
he's
a
senior
vice
president
for

of
the
city's
largest
private
employers
who
runs

raise
millions
for
both
president

obama's

campaigns
but
he
has
also
given
generously
to
republicans
as
well
over
the
past
decade
he's
donated
at
least
to
the
campaign

records
show
the
cost
of
entrance
to
monday's
event
was
for
a
guest
for
a
friend
and
for
a
sponsor
which
included
a
photo
according
to
an
invitation
obtained
by
the
associated
press
those
who
raised
for
the
campaign
were
billed
a
co-host
and
allowed
to
attend
a
private
reception
and
given
a
photo
opportunity
a
separate
vip
reception
was
held
for
donors
who
bundled
the
event
invitation
stated
biden's
campaign
did
not
say
how
much
was
raised
at
the
event
two
of
biden's
top
rivals
sens
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
and
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
have
sworn
off
big-dollar
fundraisers
and
rely
instead
on
small
online
contributions
from
grassroots
supporters
but
despite
early
success
raising
money
that
way
online
biden's
small-dollar
operation
sputtered
last
quarter
records
show
that's
forced
him
to
rely
more
on
big-dollar
donors
who
are
an
object
of
scorn
for
many
democratic
party
activists
who
believe
corporate
interests
have
too
much
sway
in
politics
biden
spoke
for
roughly
minutes
but
did
not
directly
address
suggestions
trump
has
made
without
any
evidence
that
biden
and
his
son
hunter
should
be
investigated
over
work
hunter
did
for
a
gas
company
in
ukraine
but
he
did
vow
to
fight
back
against
trump's
attacks
i'm
not
going
to
take
a
punch
and
not
punch
back
