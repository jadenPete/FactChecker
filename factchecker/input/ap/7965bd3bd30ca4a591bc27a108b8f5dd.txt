president
donald
trump's
republican
allies
controlling
the
senate
are
awarding
him
his
full
billion
request
to
build
about
miles
kilometers
of
fencing
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
the
wall
money
is
contained
in
a
billion
draft
funding
bill
for
the
department
of
homeland
security
that
cleared
its
first
easiest
hurdle
in
a
senate
panel
on
tuesday
senate
homeland
security
appropriations
chair
shelley
moore
capito
r-w
va
announced
the
billion
figure
the
money
faces
an
uphill
slog
it's
sure
to
provoke
a
filibuster
by
senate
democrats
and
is
a
non-starter
with
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
tuesday's
subcommittee
vote
was
routine
but
a
heated
debate
awaits
on
thursday
when
the
legislation
is
voted
on
in
the
full
appropriations
committee
where
democrats
promise
votes
to
cut
the
wall
funding
trump
won
billion
earlier
this
year
through
the
regular
budget
process
he
almost
immediately
declared
a
national
emergency
that
triggered
his
ability
to
conduct
a
recently
announced
billion
transfer
from
military
base
construction
the
new
gop-backed
money
comes
after
trump
roiled
capitol
hill
by
transferring
billion
from
pentagon
accounts
to
get
around
lawmakers
opposed
to
his
border
wall
some
billion
of
the
wall
money
is
coming
through
trump's
controversial
emergency
declaration
earlier
this
year
which
permitted
him
to
raid
military
construction
projects
such
as
schools
and
target
ranges
to
finance
the
wall
sen
jon
tester
d-mont
said
the
border
wall
is
a
gross
waste
of
taxpayer
dollars
the
senate
is
slated
to
vote
wednesday
on
a
democratic
measure
to
nullify
trump's
emergency
powers
an
identical
bill
passed
congress
earlier
this
year
but
was
successfully
vetoed
by
trump
tuesday's
legislation
also
would
fund
detention
beds
for
immigrants
entering
the
country
illegally
a
panel
aide
said
which
is
higher
than
current
funding
but
is
roughly
equal
to
the
levels
presently
permitted
after
the
trump
administration
used
transfer
powers
to
finance
additional
beds
capito
said
the
border
wall
and
detention
beds
are
two
areas
where
republicans
and
democrats
can't
seem
to
agree
the
homeland
security
measure
is
one
of
four
bills
slated
for
initial
committee
votes
this
week
but
floor
action
is
on
hold
after
democrats
filibustered
a
huge
funding
package
last
week
that
was
anchored
by
an
almost
billion
pentagon
funding
bill
democrats
vow
that
the
defense
measure
which
is
a
top
priority
of
trump
and
his
gop
allies
won't
advance
until
there
is
bipartisan
progress
on
domestic
spending
measures
that
they
particularly
care
about
