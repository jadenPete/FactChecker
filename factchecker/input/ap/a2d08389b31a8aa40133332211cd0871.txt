that
got
away
washington
ap
as
president
donald
trump
visits
the
united
nations
building
in
new
york
this
week
he
won't
be
focused
only
on
the
global
challenges
facing
the
world
body
he's
still
reliving
the
real
estate
deal
there
that
got
away
more
than
a
decade
later
trump
vividly
recalls
the
overtures
he
made
to
rebuild
the
story
tower
in
the
early
s
and
posits
that
he
could
have
done
a
better
job
with
the
billion
project
which
took
about
three
years
longer
than
anticipated
and
came
in
more
than
million
over
budget
in
the
leadup
to
this
week's
u.n.
general
assembly
meetings
the
president
reminisced
with
reporters
on
air
force
one
this
past
week
about
his
efforts
to
win
the
project
i
offered
to
rebuild
it
at
a
tiny
fraction
of
what
they
were
going
to
build
it
for
he
said
in
then-developer
trump
went
before
a
u.s.
senate
committee
to
complain
that
the
u.n.
was
bungling
the
project
they
don't
know
what
they
want
they
don't
know
what
they
have
they
don't
know
what
they're
doing
trump
said
he
appealed
to
the
panel
to
let
him
manage
the
project
he
would
even
waive
his
fee
he
said
in
the
end
he
didn't
get
the
project
but
his
words
were
music
to
senators
concerned
about
costs
when
can
you
start
said
one
appreciative
lawmaker
sen
mark
dayton
d-minn
who
went
on
to
serve
as
the
state's
governor
for
two
terms
trump
is
scheduled
to
speak
to
the
u.n.
general
assembly
on
tuesday
he
was
asked
if
he'll
think
back
to
his
real
estate
days
when
he
returns
to
the
u.n.
compound
it
sounded
like
he
certainly
would
i
was
a
very
good
real
estate
developer
he
reminisced
he
added
that
he
had
correctly
predicted
it
will
end
up
being
much
more
than
expected
they
didn't
even
know
what
new
york
steam
was
versus
a
boiler
he
said
of
the
developers
they
knew
nothing
trump
said
an
ambassador
he
believed
from
sweden
contacted
him
to
ask
how
he
could
have
built
trump
world
tower
right
across
the
street
from
the
u.n.
compound
for
far
less
than
what
was
envisioned
for
the
smaller
u.n.
headquarters
i
said
because
i
know
how
the
game
is
played
trump
recalled
trump
said
he
could
have
completed
the
project
for
about
million
he
would
have
used
marble
instead
of
terrazzo
which
is
much
more
expensive
he
recalled
the
u.n.
compound
was
largely
built
between
and
over
time
it
no
longer
conformed
to
safety
and
fire
codes
or
to
security
needs
the
u.s.
provided
about
million
to
help
pay
for
the
renovations
according
to
a
government
accountability
office
report
trump
clearly
got
a
kick
out
of
rehashing
the
episode
it
gave
him
one
more
chance
to
relive
his
developer
days
it
would
have
been
a
great
job
he
declared
