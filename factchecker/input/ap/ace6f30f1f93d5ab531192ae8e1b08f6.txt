the
intersection
of
trump
ukraine
and
a
whistleblower
washington
ap
very
behind
the
scenes
a
whistleblower
from
the
intelligence
community
voiced
urgent
concern
about
a
matter
involving
a
conversation
between
ukraine's
leader
and
president
donald
trump
it's
so
hush-hush
that
even
democrats
won't
say
all
that
they
know
or
suspect
very
much
out
in
the
open
trump
is
calling
for
an
investigation
that
involves
ukraine
and
could
help
him
win
re-election
if
it
breaks
his
way
trump's
interest
in
getting
dirt
from
abroad
on
prospective
democratic
presidential
rival
joe
biden
has
been
hiding
in
plain
sight
for
months
his
fealty
to
standards
that
other
presidents
have
either
lived
by
or
pretended
to
as
when
it
comes
to
chats
with
foreign
leaders
for
example
is
thin
this
is
after
all
the
man
who
openly
encouraged
russia
to
snoop
on
hillary
clinton's
email
and
much
more
recently
said
that
sure
he'd
listen
to
foreigners
who
come
to
him
with
dirt
on
an
opponent
why
not
he
wondered
as
the
contours
of
the
episode
roiling
the
capital
begin
to
flesh
out
here
are
some
questions
and
answers
at
the
intersection
of
trump
ukraine
and
the
whistleblower
why
the
whistle
because
someone
in
the
government
who
is
under
the
umbrella
of
u.s.
intelligence
saw
or
heard
something
that
raised
a
credible
and
urgent
concern
about
how
someone
else
in
government
did
or
said
something
that
involves
confidential
and
potentially
privileged
communications
by
persons
outside
the
intelligence
community
that's
according
to
michael
atkinson
the
inspector
general
for
intelligence
it's
no
more
spelled
out
than
that
so
far
because
the
complaint
remains
a
closely
held
secret
but
the
complaint
was
based
on
a
series
of
events
one
of
which
was
a
july
call
between
trump
and
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
the
people
were
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
issue
by
name
and
were
granted
anonymity
what
does
trump
say
about
the
complaint
just
another
political
hack
job
i
have
conversations
with
many
leaders
it's
always
appropriate
as
for
the
july
phone
conversation
he
had
with
zelenskiy
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
discussed
what
do
democrats
say
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
says
if
reports
about
the
complaint
bear
out
trump
faces
serious
repercussions
and
the
nation
will
have
grave
urgent
concerns
for
our
national
security
as
the
leader
at
the
center
of
a
months-long
democratic
debate
over
whether
to
impeach
trump
she
has
resisted
pressure
from
members
to
do
so
pelosi
will
find
her
every
word
on
this
matter
scrutinized
for
signs
of
whether
this
makes
her
want
to
move
ahead
where
do
ukraine
and
biden
come
into
it
biden
was
vice
president
with
some
influence
over
u.s.
policy
on
ukraine
when
son
hunter
was
on
the
board
of
an
energy
company
owned
by
a
ukrainian
businessman
trump
for
months
has
been
calling
for
more
scrutiny
of
that
period
and
impugning
corrupt
motives
to
the
business
and
government
work
of
the
biden
family
without
putting
forward
evidence
of
wrongdoing
someone
ought
to
look
into
joe
biden
he
said
again
friday
undeterred
by
the
revelation
of
the
whistleblower
complaint
the
question
arising
from
this
matter
is
whether
trump
personally
pressed
zelenskiy
to
investigate
the
bidens
in
that
phone
call
or
other
times
and
if
so
whether
seeking
or
accepting
such
help
from
a
foreign
leader
to
benefit
his
re-election
constitutes
a
misuse
of
presidential
power
that
question
can't
be
answered
with
what's
known
so
far
is
this
russia
redux
just
a
different
country
there
are
some
similarities
with
the
episode
investigated
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
as
he
tracked
an
aggressive
effort
by
russia
to
tilt
the
u.s.
election
to
trump
there
are
also
differences
as
well
as
much
that
remains
unknown
the
mueller
report
informed
or
reminded
everyone
that
it's
illegal
for
a
political
campaign
to
accept
a
thing
of
value
from
a
foreign
government
it
could
be
argued
that
an
investigation
by
a
foreign
government
meant
to
harm
a
political
opponent
would
be
a
thing
of
value
and
pressing
for
one
could
be
perilous
for
a
u.s.
president
it
could
also
be
argued
that
it
is
not
the
trump
administration
has
had
longstanding
complaints
about
corruption
in
ukraine
and
asking
for
corruption
to
be
investigated
is
on
the
surface
different
than
the
potential
collusion
between
moscow
and
the
trump
campaign
that
mueller
looked
into
one
striking
twist
here
is
that
pressure
for
a
ukrainian
investigation
of
the
bidens
has
come
most
publicly
not
from
the
government
or
the
campaign
but
from
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
giuliani
has
been
working
for
months
to
get
ukraine's
leadership
to
probe
the
bidens
how
in
may
giuliani
scrapped
plans
to
take
his
case
for
a
biden
investigation
directly
to
authorities
in
kiev
when
word
got
out
about
the
trip
but
he's
been
talking
to
ukrainians
about
it
at
the
time
he
tweeted
explain
to
me
why
biden
shouldn't
be
investigated
if
his
son
got
millions
from
a
russian
loving
crooked
ukrainian
oligarch
while
he
was
vp
and
point
man
for
ukraine
trump
tag-teamed
him
on
the
biden
matter
telling
fox
news
i'm
hearing
it's
a
major
scandal
major
problem
asked
thursday
on
cnn
whether
he'd
pressed
ukrainian
leaders
to
probe
the
bidens
giuliani
said
of
course
i
did
seconds
after
saying
no
actually
i
didn't
where's
the
complaint
under
wraps
only
bits
and
pieces
of
information
about
it
have
emerged
because
the
administration
has
balked
at
showing
it
to
congress
much
less
to
the
public
the
timeline
is
this
atkinson
the
inspector
general
received
the
complaint
aug
reviewed
it
and
found
it
credible
and
urgent
and
forwarded
it
two
weeks
later
to
joseph
maguire
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
maguire's
office
decided
the
complaint
was
outside
the
agency's
jurisdiction
and
not
urgent
and
informed
congress
sept
of
the
situation
without
showing
it
the
complaint
atkinson
said
that
was
a
break
from
normal
procedure
which
is
to
disclose
the
contents
to
lawmakers
that's
when
house
democrats
began
to
suspect
that
trump
was
the
subject
of
the
complaint
and
quickly
followed
with
a
subpoena
yet
to
be
satisfied
atkinson
appeared
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
behind
closed
doors
thursday
but
declined
under
administration
orders
to
tell
lawmakers
the
substance
of
the
complaint
maguire
has
agreed
to
give
public
testimony
sept
and
both
are
expected
to
talk
to
the
senate
intelligence
committee
