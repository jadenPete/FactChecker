twisted

washington
ap
president
donald
trump
is
twisting
reality
on
gun
control
and
the
environment
pressed
over
the
weekend
for
his
position
on
gun
legislation
the
president
declined
to
answer
whether
he
would
support
expanded
background
checks
in
the
wake
of
deadly
mass
shootings
and
blamed
democrats
in
congress
for
doing
nothing
on
the
issue
that's
not
true
the
democratic-controlled
house
in
february
approved
legislation
which
has
since
stalled
because
the
senate
hasn't
acted
republican
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
he
won't
move
on
it
or
any
gun
legislation
until
trump
says
what
he
wants
and
on
the
environment
trump
and
his
team
are
dismissing
the
reality
of
stalled
u.s.
progress
in
air
quality
in
revoking
california's
authority
to
set
stricter
fuel
economy
standards
on
cars
than
washington
they
claimed
that
more
lenient
rules
would
be
good
for
the
environment
his
administration's
data
show
otherwise
the
claims
helped
mark
a
week
of
familiar
exaggerations
misstatements
and
fabrications
by
trump
on
topics
from
drug
prices
and
the
news
media
to
trade
a
recap
gun
control
trump
on
gun
legislation
it's
an
issue
that
frankly
congress
is
wasting
all
their
time
on
nonsense
the
democrats
in
congress
are
doing
nothing
remarks
to
reporters
sunday
the
facts
actually
trump
is
the
holdup
on
gun
control
legislation
the
house
passed
its
bill
in
february
that
would
require
background
checks
on
all
gun
sales
including
those
between
strangers
who
meet
online
or
at
gun
shows
but
mcconnell
r-ky
said
it's
not
clear
the
senate
would
be
able
to
pass
the
legislation
or
that
trump
would
sign
it
into
law
last
week
mcconnell
stressed
that
congress
would
remain
in
a
holding
pattern
on
gun
control
as
lawmakers
await
proposals
from
the
white
house
trump
had
previously
pledged
to
veto
the
house-passed
bill
but
has
since
offered
contradictory
messages
in
reacting
to
recent
mass
shootings
days
after
the
el
paso
shooting
last
month
he
said
he
was
eager
to
implement
very
meaningful
background
checks
on
guns
and
told
reporters
there
was
tremendous
support
for
action
he
later
backed
away
saying
the
current
system
of
background
checks
was
very
very
strong
a
proposal
being
floated
last
week
by
attorney
general
william
barr
on
capitol
hill
would
require
background
checks
on
all
commercial
gun
sales
including
at
gun
shows
trump
told
reporters
the
plan
was
one
of
many
ideas
under
consideration
and
he
would
go
very
slowly
he
and
white
house
aides
have
discussed
a
number
of
gun
control
measures
with
lawmakers
including
steps
to
go
after
fraudulent
buyers
notify
state
and
local
law
enforcement
when
a
potential
buyer
fails
a
background
check
issue
state-level
emergency
risk
protection
orders
boost
mental
health
assistance
and
speed
up
executions
for
those
convicted
of
mass
shootings
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
and
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
have
told
trump
that
gun-control
legislation
must
include
the
house-passed
bill
to
expand
background
checks
saying
that
any
other
proposal
could
leave
open
dangerous
loopholes

relative
to

cnn
on
sunday
the
facts
that's
not
true
while
the
trump
administration
is
entitled
to
its
opinion
that
the
landmark
paris
agreement
deal
hurts
american
workers
the
pact
did
not
put
the
u.s.
in
a
more
unfavorable
position
relative
to
the
rest
of
the
world
under
the
agreement
every
country
created
and
chose
its
own
goals
to
reduce
carbon
pollution
the
u.s.
goal
set
at
the
time
by
the
obama
administration
was
to
by
reduce
emissions
by
compared
with
which
translates
to
compared
with
levels
that
goal
was
less
stringent
than
britain
which
already
reduced
its
level
by
compared
with
levels
and
countries
in
the
european
union
whose
goal
was
to
achieve
reductions
of

by
according
to
stanford
university
professor
rob
jackson
who
chairs
the
global
carbon
project
of
scientists
who
track
worldwide
carbon
emissions
the
u.s.
commitment
was
frankly
not
particularly
too
ambitious
jackson
said
there
were
some
countries
that
set
lower
goals
than
the
u.s.
such
as
russia
but
trump
could
have
relaxed
the
u.s.
goal
if
he
considered
it
too
burdensome
rather
than
withdraw
from
the
deal
altogether
trump
rejected
the
paris
agreement
because
he's
not
committed
to
climate
action
not
because
the
u.s.

was
too
stringent
or

the

news
release
thursday
the
facts
trump
and
his
officials
are
inflating
the
projected
savings
to
consumers
under
his
plan
to
relax
fuel-efficiency
rules
and
may
be
exaggerating
the
safety
benefits
it's
not
clear
yet
what
the
trump
administration
will
propose
as
its
final
fuel-efficiency
rules
but
in
the
past
it
has
favored
freezing
obama-era
mileage
standards
at
levels
his
own
administration
contends
that
freezing
the
fuel
economy
standards
will
reduce
the
average
sticker
price
of
new
vehicles
by
about
by
but
that
number
is
disputed
by
environmental
groups
and
is
more
than
double
the
estimates
from
the
obama
administration
they
are
also
ignoring
money
that
consumers
would
save
at
the
gas
pump
under
the
obama-era
standards
if
cars
get
better
mileage
a
study
released
aug
by
consumer
reports
found
that
the
owner
of
a
vehicle
will
pay
over
more
for
gasoline
during
the
life
of
a
vehicle
if
the
standards
are
frozen
at
levels
the
administration's
proposed
freeze
would
hold
the
average
fuel
economy
for
the
new-vehicle
fleet
at
mpg
in
real-world
driving
while
the
obama-era
standards
would
raise
it
to
mpg
by
according
to
consumer
reports
trump's
assertion
that
cars
would
be
substantially
safer
also
is
in
dispute
his
administration
argues
that
lower-cost
vehicles
would
allow
more
people
to
buy
new
ones
that
are
safer
cutting
roadway
deaths
by
lives
through
the
model
year
but
the
associated
press
reported
last
year
that
internal
epa
emails
show
senior
career
officials
privately
questioned
the
administration's
calculations
saying
the
proposed
freeze
would
actually
modestly
increase
highway
fatalities
by
about
deaths
annually
consumer
reports
adds
that
any
safety
impact
from
changes
in
gas
mileage
standards
would
be
small
and
won't
vary
much
from
zero

andrew

it's

remarks
thursday
the
facts
while
electric
cars
are
currently
out
of
reach
for
most
people
that

changing
automakers

the

because
of
my
administration
drug
prices
are
down
for
the
first
time
in
almost
years
tweet
thursday
the
facts
he's
exaggerating
his
influence
on
drug
prices
most
of
his
administration's
ambitious
campaign
to
reduce
drug
prices
has
yet
to
be
completed
major
regulations
are
in
the
works
and
legislation
has
yet
to
be
passed
by
congress
a
rule
requiring
drugmakers
to
disclose
prices
in
tv
ads
has
been
blocked
for
now
by
the
courts
it's
true
that
harsh
criticism
of
the
industry
from
trump
and
lawmakers
of
both
parties
in
congress
may
be
having
some
effect
the
commerce
department's
inflation
index
for
prescription
drug
prices
has
declined
in
seven
of
the
past
eight
months
which
is
highly
unusual
that
index
includes
lower-cost
generic
drugs
which
account
for
of
prescriptions
filled
in
the
u.s.
prices
for
generics
have
been
declining
under
pressure
from
big
drug
distributors
but
for
brand-name
drugs
a
recent
analysis
by
the
associated
press
shows
that
on
average
prices
are
still
going
up
but
at
a
slower
pace
the
cost
of
brand-name
drugs
is
what's
most
concerning
to
consumers
with
insured
patients
facing
steep
copays
for
some
medications
the
ap
analysis
found
that
in
the
first
seven
months
of
drugmakers
raised
list
prices
for
brand-name
medicines
by
a
median
or
midpoint
of
that
does
reflect
a
slowing
in
price
increases
they
were
going
up
or
over
those
months
the
prior
four
years
but
it's
not
a
decrease
in
actual
prices
there
were
price
increases
for
every
decrease

first
seven

the

no

is
an
incorrect
statement
as

on

the
facts
he's
ignoring
his
own
words
and
those
of
his
aides
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
at
the
white
house
the
week
before
that
trump
made
clear
he
would
meet
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
without
setting
any
conditions
first
often
top-level
diplomacy
between
adversaries
only
proceeds
after
both
sides
agree
to
take
a
few
steps
to
ease
tensions
and
when
asked
by
nbc's
meet
the
press
in
june
whether
he'd
set
any
conditions
for
meeting
iranian
leadership
trump
replied
not
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
no
preconditions
a
year
earlier
trump
told
reporters
that
it
would
be
good
for
both
countries
if
the
leaders
talked
no
preconditions
if
they
wanna
meet
i'll
meet
after
his
tweet
trump
explained
that
sanctions
won't
be
taken
off
iran
as
a
requirement
for
talks
and
that's
what
he
meant
when
he
declared
no
preconditions
but
the
absence
of
preconditions
cuts
both
ways
it
also
means
for
example
that
iran's
behavior
with
its
nuclear
program
or
with
hostile
actions
against
other
states
in
the
region
do
not
need
to
be
checked
