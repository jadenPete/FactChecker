furor
over
trump
puts
ukraine's
leader
in
a
tough
spot
moscow
ap
volodymyr
zelenskiy
the
comedian
elected
ukraine's
leader
in
april
took
office
pledging
to
focus
on
ending
the
separatist
fighting
in
the
country's
east
fomented
by
russia
but
now
barely
days
in
power
he
finds
himself
at
the
center
of
a
political
furor
involving
the
u.s.
ukraine's
friend
and
backer
it
is
a
supremely
delicate
position
for
zelenskiy
a
year-old
political
novice
trying
to
deal
simultaneously
with
two
powerful
figures
with
outsize
influence
over
his
country's
future
u.s.
president
donald
trump
and
russian
leader
vladimir
putin
trump
is
suspected
of
pressuring
zelenskiy
over
the
summer
to
investigate
political
rival
joe
biden's
family
at
the
same
time
trump
was
withholding
nearly
million
in
military
aid
to
the
eastern
european
country
the
u.s.
president
has
insisted
he
did
nothing
wrong
while
democrats
are
demanding
to
know
whether
he
improperly
used
his
office
to
try
to
dig
up
dirt
on
an
opponent
in
a
tv
interview
over
the
weekend
ukraine's
foreign
minister
denied
zelenskiy
was
pressured
to
investigate
biden's
son
hunter
zelenskiy's
office
however
has
declined
to
comment
on
the
reports
a
senior
official
in
zelenskiy's
administration
said
monday
that
the
president
is
following
his
advisers
guidance
not
to
get
involved
in
what
many
see
as
part
of
the
presidential
campaign
in
the
u.s.
the
official
was
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
matter
publicly
and
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
kyiv-based
analyst
vadim
karasyov
the
matter
is
another
headache
for
zelenskiy
whose
only
political
experience
before
his
election
consisted
of
playing
a
president
on
ukrainian
tv
zelenskiy
has
got
himself
into
a
tight
spot
his
team
is
now
having
to
deal
with
two
difficult
tasks
looking
for
a
compromise
with
russia
and
maintaining
the
neutrality
in
the
american
politics
karasyov
said
ukraine
faces
a
very
tough
choice
because
kyiv
is
counting
on
american
military
and
financial
aid
zelenskiy
is
trying
to
stay
impartial
and
not
get
involved
but
it's
getting
harder
and
harder
the
united
states
has
been
one
of
ukraine's
most
steadfast
allies
since
a
new
pro-western
government
took
power
in
and
russia
annexed
ukraine's
crimea
and
threw
its
weight
behind
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
the
u.s.
has
poured
millions
into
ukraine's
armed
forces
ukraine's
political
establishment
is
already
seeing
the
political
furor
as
a
problem
for
the
country
pavlo
klimkin
ukraine's
foreign
minister
for
five
years
before
he
resigned
in
august
said
ukraine
has
been
swept
unwittingly
into
the
vortex
of
american
politics
this
will
be
on
the
agenda
of
the
entire
u.s.
election
campaign
but
when
the
wave
is
coming
it
makes
no
sense
to
resist
you
either
have
to
step
back
or
take
your
surf
and
ride
it
he
wrote
on
facebook
over
the
weekend
zelenskiy's
landslide
victory
raised
hopes
for
breaking
the
stalemate
in
the
separatist
conflict
that
has
been
raging
since
and
killed
more
than
people
the
new
president
has
tried
to
engage
russia
directly
it
was
zelenskiy
who
picked
up
the
phone
to
call
putin
over
the
summer
to
discuss
a
prisoner
exchange
several
weeks
later
people
from
russia
and
ukraine
were
released
in
the
biggest
swap
in
years
separately
foreign
policy
chiefs
of
ukraine
russia
france
and
germany
sat
down
for
talks
earlier
this
month
for
the
first
time
in
years
to
discuss
ways
to
jumpstart
peace
negotiations
meanwhile
the
ukrainian
president
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
provoking
moscow
zelenskiy
has
steered
clear
of
speaking
at
length
about
ukraine's
aspirations
to
join
nato
and
the
european
union
the
former
comedian
earned
accolades
at
home
for
the
prisoner
swap
which
showed
he
can
get
things
done
with
putin
he
has
also
been
praised
for
engaging
moscow
while
standing
firm
against
the
annexation
of
crimea
his
approval
ratings
have
climbed
since
he
took
office
in
may
reaching
percent
this
month
according
to
the
kyiv-based
rating
agency
while
the
ukrainian
leader
and
his
team
are
known
for
taking
to
social
media
to
make
controversial
statements
that
has
not
been
the
case
with
the
latest
furor
zelenskiy
keeps
silent
and
silence
is
golden
karasyov
said
as
long
as
zelenskiy
is
silent
he
won't
be
co-opted
by
either
of
the
political
camps
in
the
u.s.
