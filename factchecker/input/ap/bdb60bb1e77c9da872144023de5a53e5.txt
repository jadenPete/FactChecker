prosecutor
says
trump
wants
sweeping
immunity
in
tax
fight
new
york
ap
manhattan's
district
attorney
urged
a
judge
monday
to
reject
the
sweeping
immunity
sought
by
president
donald
trump
to
protect
him
from
divulging
his
tax
returns
in
a
criminal
probe
district
attorney
cyrus
r.
vance
jr
filed
papers
in
federal
court
after
trump's
attorneys
sued
last
week
to
stop
vance
from
forcing
the
president's
accounting
firm
to
release
eight
years
of
his
state
and
federal
returns
in
a
criminal
probe
vance
urged
a
judge
to
reject
trump's
request
for
a
temporary
order
blocking
vance's
subpoena
for
the
records
in
a
probe
of
payments
made
to
two
women
who
claimed
to
have
had
affairs
with
trump
he
also
asked
u.s.
district
judge
victor
marrero
to
dismiss
the
lawsuit
saying
it
belongs
in
state
court
if
anywhere
marrero
has
scheduled
oral
arguments
for
wednesday
vance
said
trump
was
asserting
the
remarkable
proposition
that
a
sitting
president
not
only
enjoys
blanket
immunity
from
criminal
prosecution
but
also
isn't
required
to
submit
to
a
routine
grand
jury
request
for
information
about
what
he
his
businesses
or
employees
did
before
he
took
office
the
law
provides
no
such
sweeping
immunity
the
court
papers
said
here
the
question
is
not
whether
a
state
prosecutor
can
indict
a
sitting
president
the
papers
said
instead
the
issue
is
whether
a
third
party
having
been
duly
served
with
a
state
grand
jury
subpoena
seeking
the
books
and
records
of
a
number
of
individuals
and
corporate
entities
including
those
of
the
president
must
comply
with
the
subpoena
trump's
lawyers
have
called
the
subpoena
requests
by
vance
a
democrat
a
bad
faith
effort
to
harass
trump
trump's
lawyers
asked
marrero
to
declare
the
subpoena
unenforceable
until
trump
leaves
office
the
subpoena
pertained
to
an
investigation
seeking
records
related
to
payments
that
former
trump
lawyer
michael
cohen
helped
arrange
to
the
porn
actress
stormy
daniels
and
model
karen
mcdougal
during
the
presidential
campaign
to
keep
either
woman
from
speaking
publicly
about
alleged
affairs
with
trump
trump
has
denied
any
sexual
relationship
with
either
woman
saying
any
payments
were
personal
matters
not
campaign
expenses
cohen
is
serving
a
three-year
prison
sentence
after
pleading
guilty
to
various
federal
charges
including
campaign
finance
fraud
and
lying
to
congress
the
case
before
marrero
comes
as
trump's
lawyers
fight
off
other
efforts
to
get
his
tax
records
trump
has
sued
to
block
two
house
committees
from
getting
his
tax
returns
and
to
shield
him
from
a
new
york
law
that
could
let
a
house
committee
get
his
state
tax
returns
trump's
campaign
and
the
republican
national
committee
also

in
sacramento
california

years
of
