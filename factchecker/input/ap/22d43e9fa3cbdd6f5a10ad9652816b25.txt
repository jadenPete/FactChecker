ap
facing
growing
calls
for
his
impeachment
president
donald
trump
addressed
the
u.n.
general
assembly
on
tuesday
and
delivered
a
roaring
defense
of
nationalism
and
american
sovereignty
even
as
he
tried
to
rally
a
multinational
response
to
iran's
escalating
aggression
the
president
implored
the
world's
leaders
to
prioritize
their
own
nations
with
strong
borders
and
one-on-one
trade
deals
rejecting
sweeping
transnational
organizations
and
alliances
the
future
does
not
belong
to
globalists
the
future
belongs
to
patriots
the
future
belongs
to
strong
independent
nations
trump
told
a
murmuring
crowd
at
the
general
assembly
globalism
exerted
a
religious
pull
over
past
leaders
causing
them
to
ignore
their
own
national
interests
those
days
are
over
focusing
on
the
united
states
self-interest
trump
said
that
the
nation's
security
was
jeopardized
by
the
threat
posed
by
iran
and
warned
tehran
to
stop
its
aggression
toward
washington's
allies
in
the
middle
east
as
long
as
iran's
menacing
behavior
continues
sanctions
will
not
be
lifted
they
will
be
tightened
trump
warned
the
united
states
does
not
seek
conflict
with
any
other
nation
we
desire
peace
cooperation
and
mutual
gain
with
all
but
i
will
never
fail
to
defend
america's
interests
as
speculation
mounted
that
trump
could
meet
in
new
york
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
the
president
raised
the
possibility
of
a
diplomatic
breakthrough
saying
the
united
states
has
never
believed
in
permanent
enemies
we
want
partners
not
adversaries
but
while
trump
commanded
the
global
stage
momentum
was
building
in
washington
among
democrats
to
impeach
the
president
after
it
was
revealed
that
he
ordered
his
staff
to
freeze
nearly
million
in
aid
to
ukraine
a
few
days
before
a
phone
call
in
which
he
pressured
the
eastern
european
nation's
leader
to
investigate
the
family
of
political
rival
joe
biden
while
trump
wants
allies
to
join
the
u.s.
in
further
isolating
iran
he
also
seems
to
be
holding
to
his
go-it-alone
strategy
of
using
economic
sanctions
to
pressure
tehran
to
give
up
its
nuclear
program
and
stop
attacks
that
are
rattling
the
middle
east
in
the
speech's
first
moments
trump
did
not
explicitly
to
blame
iran
for
recent
strikes
against
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
iran
has
denied
orchestrating
the
attack
which
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
has
deemed
an
act
of
war
britain
france
and
germany
joined
the
united
states
on
monday
in
blaming
iran
for
the
attacks
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
for
his
part
pointed
to
claims
of
responsibility
by
yemeni
rebels
and
insisted
if
iran
were
behind
this
attack
nothing
would
have
been
left
of
this
refinery
trump
also
addressed
the
ongoing
standoff
in
venezuela
denouncing
the
oppressive
regime
and
vowing
that
the
united
states
would
never
be
a
socialist
nation
the
united
states
and
more
than
a
dozen
latin
american
countries
agreed
monday
to
investigate
and
arrest
associates
and
senior
officials
of
the
venezuelan
government
of
nicol
s
maduro
who
are
suspected
of
crimes
like
drug
trafficking
money
laundering
and
financing
terrorism
trump
praised
his
diplomatic
efforts
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
even
though
the
autocrat
continues
to
hold
a
tight
grip
on
his
nuclear
weapons
trump
has
met
kim
for
summits
in
singapore
and
hanoi
vietnam
and
orchestrated
a
surprise
encounter
with
him
in
june
at
the
demilitarized
zone
where
he
became
the
first
u.s.
president
to
ever
set
foot
in
north
korea
trump
said
monday
that
another
meeting
with
the
north
korean
leader
could
happen
soon
he
provided
few
details
and
it
wasn't
clear
what
officials
were
doing
behind
the
scenes
to
set
up
a
meeting
to
break
the
diplomatic
impasse
over
the
north's
development
of
nuclear-armed
missiles
targeting
the
u.s.
mainland
trump's
comments
even
with
few
specifics
backing
them
up
are
tantalizing
because
there
is
extreme
interest
especially
in
japan
and
south
korea
in
whether
trump
and
kim
can
strike
a
deal
on
one
of
the
world's
most
pressing
standoffs
this
was
trump's
third
speech
to
the
world
body
in
his
speech
to
the
u.n.
general
assembly
last
year
trump
expressed
disdain
for
globalism
and
promoted
his
america
first
agenda
like
last
year
trump
is
expected
to
showcase
strong
u.s.
economic
numbers
and
talk
about
how
he's
strengthened
america's
military
in
his
speech
to
the
assembly
his
self-adulation
prompted
chuckles
from
world
leaders
that
barely
ruffled
trump
who
shares
a
belief
with
his
supporters
that
the
united
states
has
been
asked
to
do
too
much
for
other
countries
and
needs
to
focus
on
issues
it
faces
at
home
