ap
as
china
and
the
u.s.
near
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
president
donald
trump
said
friday
he
doesn't
feel
he
needs
to
secure
an
agreement
before
next
year's
election
trump
told
reporters
he
wants
a
complete
deal
with
china
and
won't
accept
one
that
only
addresses
some
of
the
differences
between
the
two
nations
i'm
not
looking
for
a
partial
deal
i'm
looking
for
a
complete
deal
trump
said
during
a
press
conference
with
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
for
more
than
a
year
the
world's
two
largest
economies
have
been
locked
in
a
high-stakes
duel
marked
by
trump's
escalating
penalties
on
chinese
goods
and
beijing's
retaliatory
tariffs
trump
said
voters
understand
the
spat
between
the
u.s.
and
china
and
insist
the
ongoing
trade
war
won't
hamper
his
reelection
chances
but
he
conceded
that
reaching
an
agreement
would
probably
be
a
positive
for
his
campaign
trump
continued
to
try
to
paint
a
dark
picture
of
the
chinese
economy
ahead
of
talks
that
resume
next
month
in
washington
negotiators
from
the
two
countries
are
also
engaging
in
discussions
over
the
next
two
weeks
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
the
october
session
china
is
being
affected
very
badly
we're
not
trump
insisted
it's
true
that
china's
economy
is
decelerating
slowed
by
trump's
taxes
on
chinese
imports
and
by
beijing's
deliberate
campaign
to
combat
runaway
debts
still
the
international
monetary
fund
expects
the
chinese
economy
to
grow
this
year
morrison
said
australia
has
benefited
greatly
from
china's
economic
growth
at
the
same
time
he
said
once
china's
economy
got
to
a
certain
level
then
you
need
to
be
obviously
playing
to
the
same
rules
as
those
other
developed
nations
meanwhile
the
united
states
trade
representative
updated
and
expanded
its
list

products
coming

return
to
china
kulbeck

interest
in
visiting
the

another
time

the
importance
of
passing
a
new
trade
agreement
with
canada
and
mexico

that's

to
be

up
to
a
