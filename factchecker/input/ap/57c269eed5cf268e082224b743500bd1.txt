washington
ap
rep
paul
cook
served
years
as
a
marine
and
was
awarded
two
purple
heart
medals
for
combat
wounds
suffered
in
vietnam
but
amid
his
seventh
year
in
congress
the
aching
and
discouraged
california
republican
has
decided
he's
endured
enough
at
and
nursing
brittle
knees
that
make
cross-country
flights
an
ordeal
cook
is
past
the
age
when
many
lawmakers
head
home
cook
who
announced
last
week
that
he
won't
seek
reelection
next
year
is
the
oldest
of
house
republicans
who
have
said
they
are
leaving
he
also
is
a
case
study
in
how
some
old-school
moderate
republicans
the
type
that
like
him
have
chamber
of
commerce
backgrounds
and
consider
compromise
laudable
feel
alienated
in
an
increasingly
fractious
capital
cook
believes
republicans
will
not
win
back
the
house
majority
in
the
elections
leaving
the
gop
once
again
with
frustratingly
little
clout
after
spending
most
of
this
decade
controlling
the
chamber
he
dislikes
president
donald
trump's
late-night
tweets
and
his
criticisms
of
nato
and
some
of
its
member
nations
and
he
bemoans
washington's
toxic
political
atmosphere
which
he
blames
on
hard-right
republicans
and
hard-left
democrats
the
freedom
caucus
a
lot
of
them
they
have
a
very
right-wing
agenda
that
encourages
the
same
things
that
the
far
left
does
and
that
is
we're
going
to
raise
hell
cook
said
in
an
interview
that
is
not
the
road
that
i
would
advocate
if
you're
going
to
try
and
reach
a
compromise
our
whole
government
is
built
on
compromise
his
reference
was
to
the
house
freedom
caucus
about
fervent
conservatives
who
try
pushing
the
gop
rightward
we're
mean
i
don't
know
how
else
to
say
it
cook
said
conservatives
say
they
make
no
apologies
for
not
yielding
on
what
they
consider
core
principles
such
as
the
right
to
possess
guns
i
think
that
sometimes
the
fights
are
worth
having
and
i'm
happy
to
be
in
them
said
one
freedom
caucus
member
rep
matt
gaetz
r-fla
of
the
exiting
republicans
only
a
handful
have
openly
cited
washington's
sharp
elbows
though
others
who've
retired
previously
have
expressed
similar
complaints
three
of
this
year's
other
departing
lawmakers
could
have
faced
tough
reelection
fights
three
are
running
for
the
senate
or
governor
two
are
leaving
as
their
allotted
time
as
committee
leaders
is
expiring
and
others
have
voiced
variants
of
it's
time
to
go
most
moderates
are
fighting
through
it
we're
not
a
dying
breed
said
sarah
chamberlain
who
heads
the
moderate
republican
main
street
partnership
nonetheless
lawmakers
concede
that
frequent
consuming
conflicts
between
the
parties
take
a
toll
both
democrats
and
republicans
have
fewer
house
moderates
than
they
did
two
decades
ago
that's
partly
due
to
increasingly
sophisticated
district
lines
that
strongly
favor
one
side
or
the
other
putting
a
premium
on
candidates
voicing
ardent
adherence
to
party
dogma
as
a
result
it's
been
harder
for
each
side
to
find
supporters
from
across
the
aisle
for
legislation
i
don't
know
if
frustration
is
the
right
word
there's
an
acknowledgement
that
it's
become
a
zero-sum
game
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
said
rep
john
katko
r-n
y.
a
leader
of
the
tuesday
group
of
moderate
republicans
which
claims
around
members
gop
leaders
reject
the
assumption
that
they
won't
recapture
the
house
majority
following
last
fall's
drubbing
in
which
they
lost
seats
rep
tom
emmer
r-minn
who
leads
house
republican's
political
committee
says
that
while
s
democratic
challengers
didn't
stand
for
anything
next
year
they'll
have
to
defend
hot-button
progressive
proposals
like
the
green
new
deal
cook
is
from
safe
conservative
gop
terrain
a
vast
dry
district
that
sprawls
along
the
nevada
border
and
includes
the
mojave
desert
and
death
valley
trump
took
it
easily
in
and
cook
has
never
won
less
than
percent
of
the
vote
since
his
first
election
in
he
hopes
to
win
local
office
when
he
returns
cook
worked
for
his
area
chamber
of
commerce
taught
history
at
colleges
and
was
elected
to
local
government
and
the
california
legislature
before
coming
to
congress
his
legislative
focus
has
included
military
and
veterans
issues
and
he's
had
a
low
public
profile
he's
tweeted
times
all
year
on
his
official
twitter
account
fewer
than
trump
might
unleash
on
a
raucous
day
but
cook
says
he's
bothered
by
a
white
house
that
takes
positions
that
contradict
prior
policy
particularly
on
foreign
affairs
he
recoiled
at
trump's
questioning
of
nato's
value
and
episodes
such
as
his
musings
about
purchasing
greenland
a
territory
of
denmark
that
the
nato
member
spurned
you
have
to
respect
your
allies
or
you're
not
going
to
have
your
allies
when
you
need
them
the
most
cook
said
cook
tempers
his
criticisms
of
trump
who
endorsed
him
last
year
when
he
faced
a
conservative
gop
challenger
like
most
republicans
he's
stood
by
trump
on
most
house
votes
backing
him
percent
of
the
time
according
to
the
nonpartisan
website
fivethirtyeight
com
rep
jared
huffman
d-calif
a
friend
since
they
served
together
in
the
california
legislature
calls
cook
a
prince
of
a
human
being
he
says
he
thinks
the
ex-marine
privately
disdains
trump
citing
cook's
military
service
and
sense
of
honor
cook
is
a
prisoner
to
a
republican
politics
that
has
turned
into
a
trump
cult
huffman
says
most
of
all
cook
laments
a
hardball
political
atmosphere
that
he
says
inhibits
compromise
i
have
a
lot
of
great
colleagues
here
he
said
it's
just
a
very
difficult
environment
when
you
should
be
striving
to
see
the
other
point
of
view
