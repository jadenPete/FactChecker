in
reliably
republican
oklahoma
with
an
appearance
before
the
largest
annual
gathering
of
the
comanche
nation
in
the
state
where
rival
democratic
presidential
candidate
elizabeth
warren
was
born
sanders
visit
may
remind
some
of
a
sensitive
subject
for
warren
still
criticized
after
her
october
release
of
a
dna
test
meant
to
bolster
her
claim
to
native
american
heritage
that
was
supposed
to
rebut
president
donald
trump's
mocking
of
the
massachusetts
senator
as
pocahontas
but
only
intensified
it
last
month
warren
offered
a
public
apology
to
native
americans
trying
to
show
that
the
issue
won't
be
a
political
drag
on
her
white
house
campaign
which
polls
show
on
the
rise
lately
the
comanches
who
are
holding
their
th
annual
nation
fair
powwow
are
a
plains
indian
tribe
of
about
enrolled
members
with
headquarters
just
north
of
lawton
in
southwest
oklahoma
powwows
are
important
social
events
for
many
tribes
featuring
traditional
dance
songs
food
regalia
and
other
customs
and
sunday's
was
held
at
the
tribe's
headquarters
in
the
foothills
of
the
wichita
mountains
sanders
a
vermont
senator
entered
the
powwow
grounds
in
a
procession
of
tribal
leaders
led
by
a
group
of
comanche
women
dancers
in
traditional
dress
he
was
presented
with
a
comanche
nation
blanket
what
you
understand
and
what
you
have
taught
us
and
it
is
a
lesson
that
must
be
learned
now
or
the
entire
planet
will
be
in
danger
you
have
taught
us
that
as
human
beings
we
are
part
of
nature
and
we
cannot
destroy
nature
and
survive
sanders
said
adding
that
native
americans
have
enriched
the
american
people
you
have
educated
the
american
people
i
know
and
you
know
that
for
too
many
years
the
needs
of
the
american
indian
have
been
ignored
treaties
have
been
broken
and
lie
after
lie
has
been
told
to
you
sanders
said
the
value
of
sanders
visit
was
more
symbolic
than
practical
since
the
comanche
nation
is
not
particularly
large
said
university
of
oklahoma
political
science
professor
keith
gaddie
there's
no
reason
in
order
to
win
the
state
that
you'd
have
to
go
down
to
that
event
gaddie
said
indeed
comanche
chairman
william
nelson
sr
said
that
no
presidential
candidate
had
visited
the
comanche
nation
since
teddy
roosevelt
came
to
oklahoma
to
hunt
wolves
while
still
a
white
house
hopeful
it's
an
honor
that
an
actual
candidate
for
president
would
visit
the
comanche
nation
nelson
said
sanders
won
oklahoma's
democratic
primary
over
hillary
clinton
the
state
votes
next
year
as
part
of
the
earlier
and
expanded
super
tuesday
which
comes
on
march
and
includes
neighboring
texas
warren
has
made
her
family's
financial
struggles
after
her
father
had
a
heart
attack
and
couldn't
work
forcing
her
mother
to
get
a
minimum
wage
job
a
central
theme
of
her
campaign
she
and
sanders
are
friends
who
agree
on
many
policy
issues
including
the
medicare
for
all
universal
health
insurance
plan
both
also
have
refused
to
attack
one
another
politically
ducking
questions
about
whether
they
eventually
will
have
to
compete
for
the
democratic
party's
most
liberal
wing
but
a
des
moines
register-cnn-mediacom
poll
released
saturday
showed
warren
outpacing
sanders
in
iowa
which
launches
the
democratic
nominating
contest
on
feb
she
also
was
running
about
even
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
had
been
the
crowded
field's
front
runner
as
expected
sanders
did
not
mention
warren
on
sunday
instead
telling
those
gathered
that
if
he's
elected
president
not
only
will
you
get
a
seat
at
the
table
you
will
be
part
of
the
decision
making
stephanie
landeros
a
comanche
indian
from
nearby
apache
said
she
supports
sanders
because
of
his
position
on
issues
that
are
important
to
her
including
civil
rights
protecting
the
environment
and
programs
for
the
poor
he
seems
to
be
someone
who
is
concerned
about
minorities
