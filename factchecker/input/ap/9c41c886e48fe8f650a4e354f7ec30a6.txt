biden
warren
face
same
challenge
in
iowa
keeping
momentum
des
moines
iowa
ap
a
fire
truck
a
marching
band
and
hundreds
of
supporters
ushered
joe
biden
into
this
weekend's
iowa
steak
fry
a
show
of
force
intended
to
solidify
the
former
vice
president's
front-runner
status
his
closest
rival
elizabeth
warren
slipped
in
with
little
fanfare
delivered
her
speech
and
hit
a
brief
selfie
line
before
departing
the
show
their
approaches
to
the
steak
fry
were
as
divergent
as
their
views
on
the
role
of
government
but
warren
and
biden
increasingly
face
the
same
challenge
the
pressure
of
being
on
top
they're
entering
a
critical
phase
of
the
iowa
campaign
in
a
close
race
for
first
place
for
warren
it's
a
sign
that
the
investments
she's
made
in
staff
and
personal
interactions
with
voters
have
paid
off
but
it
also
means
she'll
increasingly
be
the
subject
of
attacks
from
her
rivals
who
want
to
blunt
her
rise
for
biden
months
of
attacks
have
done
little
to
erode
his
standing
among
democrats
but
warren's
strength
underscores
his
weaknesses
among
progressive
voters
ensuring
he
won't
be
able
to
coast
to
success
in
iowa
or
any
of
the
other
early
voting
states
there's
plenty
of
precedent
for
candidates
doing
well
in
iowa
the
summer
before
the
caucuses
only
to
fade
when
voting
nears
with
the
caucuses
just
over
four
months
away
more
than
a
dozen
other
candidates
are
increasingly
desperate
to
do
whatever
they
can
to
overtake
biden
and
warren
the
dynamics
suggest
a
volatile
period
ahead
as
democrats
begin
to
more
seriously
grapple
with
who
they
want
to
take
on
president
donald
trump
next
fall
anything
can
happen
said
j.
ann
selzer
the
longtime
director
of
the
iowa
poll
produced
by
the
des
moines
register
and
its
partners
selzer
managed
a
poll
released
saturday
by
the
des
moines
register
cnn
and
mediacom
which
found
warren
running
about
even
with
biden
who
led
their
last
poll
in
june
the
survey
showed
more
than
of
likely
democratic
caucusgoers
could
still
change
their
minds
on
who
to
support
a
number
of
lower-tier
candidates
who've
staked
their
candidacies
on
iowa
cite
that
large
chunk
of
undecided
voters
as
evidence
they
still
have
a
shot
even
as
their
campaigns
stall
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
who
boasts
the
most
iowa
endorsements
and
a
strong
campaign
team
warned
supporters
he'd
have
to
raise
big
money
fast
or
drop
out
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
has
staked
her
campaign
on
the
idea
that
her
midwestern
roots
would
endear
her
to
iowans
but
she's
stuck
in
low
single
digits
despite
frequent
trips
to
the
state
and
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
who
drew
mobs
of
supporters
to
small
iowa
towns
when
he
launched
his
bid
is
now
campaigning
beyond
the
early
primary
states
in
search
of
a
win
some
candidates
are
rethinking
their
iowa
strategies
to
better
position
themselves
for
a
strong
caucus
showing
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
who
once
seemed
like
biden's
biggest
foe
parted
ways
with
his
iowa
political
director
in
recent
weeks
california
sen
kamala
harris
seemed
mildly
chagrined
to
have
to
dig
out
her
cold-weather
gear
as
she
committed
jokingly
to
moving
to
iowa
in
order
to
resuscitate
a
campaign
stuck
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
harris
has
pledged
to
double
her
staff
in
the
state
and
campaign
in
iowa
every
week
in
october
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
has
been
investing
heavily
in
his
iowa
operation
and
will
by
the
end
of
this
month
nearly
match
biden
in
staff
numbers
and
field
office
openings
not
only
did
he
have
more
than
supporters
at
the
event
he
invited
more
than
two
dozen
donors
in
hopes
of
demonstrating
he
can
win
in
a
class
of
rivals
with
much
higher
national
profiles
buttigieg
advisers
met
in
des
moines
with
donors
saturday
evening
to
discuss
his
recent
organizational
surge
to
increase
staff
to
paid
workers
and
offices
statewide
putting
him
on
par
with
warren
you
need
to
be
in
the
hunt
you
need
to
have
the
resources
to
compete
said
buttigieg
who
raised
a
record
million
in
the
second
quarter
and
is
expected
to
be
competitive
in
the
third
quarter
which
comes
to
a
close
next
week
biden's
allies
remain
adamant
that
what
democratic
primary
voters
most
want
is
someone
who
can
beat
trump
and
that
biden
is
seen
as
the
safest
bet
to
do
so
but
some
voters
say
as
biden
has
faced
scrutiny
for
his
past
policy
positions
and
racked
up
repeated
gaffes
that
veneer
of
electability
is
showing
cracks
i
just
wonder
if
he
has
what
it
takes
anymore
said
year-old
frank
hansen
of
des
moines
i
think
it
has
to
be
someone
younger
and
ready
to
take
on
the
future
hansen's
wife
holly
attended
this
weekend's
steak
fry
echoing
her
husband
she
said
joe
biden
was
the
person
seen
as
the
strongest
one
i'm
not
so
sure
now
the
couple
said
they
were
looking
to
a
newer
class
of
candidates
including
buttigieg
o'rourke
and
warren
who
despite
being
just
seems
new
and
fresh
holly
said
iowa
political
history
holds
warnings
for
warren
as
well
after
previous
candidates
peaked
too
early
and
weren't
able
to
sustain
their
momentum
through
caucus
night
in
the
late
summer
of
howard
dean
was
the
iowa
frontrunner
he
eventually
fell
to
john
kerry
after
being
tagged
as
angry
and
unprepared
for
a
national
race
in
the
fall
of
hillary
clinton
still
led
in
the
polls
but
eventually
faced
an
upset
to
then-sen
barack
obama
after
he
criticized
her
as
running
a
too-careful
campaign
indeed
this
week
warren's
opponents
stepped
up
their
attacks
against
her
with
biden
knocking
her
on
raising
taxes
to
pay
for
a
single-payer
health
care
system
while
buttigieg
called
her
evasive
about
the
tax
issue
warren
has
however
stayed
staunchly
on-message
insisting
when
pressed
by
reporters
this
week
in
iowa
only
that
costs
will
go
down
for
the
middle
class
if
her
health
care
plan
is
passed
her
response
has
been
much
like
the
campaign
she's
run
in
iowa
steady
and
focused
with
little
fanfare
and
an
eye
on
the
end
goal
rather
than
the
day-to-day
fluctuations
in
the
field
she
shrugged
off
questions
about
her
strength
in
iowa
on
sunday
i
don't
do
polls
she
said
as
she
joined
a
protest
with
striking
united
auto
workers
members
we
are
still
months
away
from
the
iowa
caucuses
and
the
first
primary
elections
