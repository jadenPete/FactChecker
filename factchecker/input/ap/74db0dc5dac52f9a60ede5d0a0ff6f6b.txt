trump's
tough
politics
a
challenge
for
democrats
washington
ap
in
donald
trump
blew
through
the
guardrails
of
american
politics
in
his
bid
for
reelection
he's
poised
to
blow
them
up
this
time
around
he's
aided
by
the
power
of
the
presidency
with
its
unmatched
megaphone
and
resources
and
his
latest
provocation
prodding
a
foreign
leader
to
investigate
democratic
rival
joe
biden
suggests
he
sees
little
issue
using
his
office
for
his
personal
political
interests
his
actions
foreshadow
a
no-holds-barred
campaign
regardless
of
who
democrats
select
as
their
nominee
in
the
coming
months
if
the
lesson
of
trump's
victory
was
that
deeply
personal
attacks
and
factually
inaccurate
innuendo
are
a
pathway
to
victory
his
playbook
appears
to
include
more
of
the
same
democrats
are
more
clear-eyed
about
the
effectiveness
of
those
tactics
but
still
deeply
uncertain
over
the
best
approach
and
the
best
candidate
to
blunt
them
fight
back
against
trump
and
risk
running
a
campaign
on
his
terms
and
elevating
his
baseless
attacks
ignore
him
and
allow
his
arguments
to
percolate
unchecked
through
the
conservative
media
ecosystem
democrats
concede
he
is
jarringly
effective
at
dictating
the
terms
of
the
political
debate
and
throwing
his
opponents
off
stride
donald
trump's
greatest
political
skill
is
the
ability
to
pull
people
into
his
vortex
of
terribleness
where
you
spend
all
day
every
day
responding
to
trump's
outrage
du
jour
and
defending
yourself
from
absurd
baseless
accusations
said
dan
pfeiffer
an
obama
campaign
and
white
house
adviser
that's
where
biden
finds
himself
at
the
moment
answering
questions
about
his
son
hunter's
work
for
a
ukrainian
gas
company
at
the
same
time
his
father
was
leading
american
diplomatic
efforts
to
help
the
country's
fledgling
government
there
is
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
either
man
and
hunter
biden
is
no
longer
working
for
the
company
yet
joe
biden
still
spent
a
weekend
of
campaigning
in
iowa
deflecting
questions
about
the
matter
and
urging
reporters
to
focus
their
attention
back
on
trump
ask
the
right
questions
he
bellowed
when
asked
by
a
reporter
how
many
times
he
had
spoken
to
his
son
about
his
overseas
business
dealings
to
be
sure
trump's
appeal
to
ukraine's
president
may
ultimately
create
political
problems
for
the
president
the
matter
is
part
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
the
administration
is
withholding
from
congress
citing
presidential
privilege
congressional
democrats
who
have
already
been
stymied
by
the
white
house
in
numerous
investigations
are
outraged
and
many
members
are
renewing
calls
for
impeachment
california
rep
adam
schiff
the
intelligence
committee
chairman
who
has
so
far
resisted
impeachment
efforts
said
sunday
that
trump's
actions
may
very
well
have
crossed
the
rubicon
here
trump
and
his
allies
have
spent
months
laying
the
groundwork
for
the
questions
about
biden
and
his
son
well
aware
that
the
former
vice
president
would
make
for
a
formidable
general
election
opponent
given
his
ties
to
the
working
class
voters
who
abandoned
democrats
for
trump
in
rudy
giuliani
trump's
personal
lawyer
has
publicly
acknowledged
pitching
ukrainian
politicians
on
investigating
the
bidens
trump
is
now
alleged
to
have
repeatedly
asked
ukraine's
president
to
help
with
that
effort
his
request
for
a
foreign
leader's
help
in
the
election
came
in
a
july
phone
call
one
day
after
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
congressional
testimony
effectively
quashed
democratic
hopes
of
impeaching
trump
over
russian
election
interference
in
the
campaign
mueller's
investigation
did
little
to
dissuade
trump
about
the
impropriety
of
accepting
election
help
from
a
foreign
government
earlier
this
year
he
said
in
an
interview
with
abc
news
that
if
another
country
had
negative
information
about
a
political
rival
he
would
have
no
problem
accepting
it
i
think
you
might
want
to
listen
there
isn't
anything
wrong
with
listening
trump
said
in
the
june
interview
if
somebody
called
from
a
country
norway
and
said
we
have
information
on
your
opponent
oh
i
think
i'd
want
to
hear
it
following
revelations
that
trump
appeared
to
follow
through
on
those
words
in
his
conversation
with
the
ukrainian
president
democratic
presidential
candidates
called
his
behavior
un-democratic
it's
beyond
laughing
or
crying
said
pete
buttigieg
a
white
house
hopeful
and
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
it
is
a
betrayal
of
the
united
states
california
sen
kamala
harris
told
the
associated
press
that
trump's
actions
were
inexcusable
and
an
act
against
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
harris
who
has
hit
biden
during
recent
debates
also
subtly
reflected
the
ways
in
which
the
accusations
trump
unearths
can
begin
to
take
hold
no
matter
how
accurate
they
are
asked
by
the
ap
if
this
in
any
way
casts
aspersions
on
vice
president
biden's
campaign
or
his
character
harris
declined
to
comment
i'll
leave
that
up
to
the
pundits
i
don't
have
a
