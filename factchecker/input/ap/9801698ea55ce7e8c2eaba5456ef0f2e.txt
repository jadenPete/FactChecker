the

pennsylvania
crowded
onto
the
steps
of
a
local
courthouse
dozens
of
union
men
protesting
a
looming
power
plant
closure
that
would
put
their

at

the
crowd
was
overwhelmingly
white
and
male

at

from

were
broader

about

last

i
would
again
a

days
earlier
tens
of
thousands
of
democrats
crowded
into
a
manhattan

cheering
elizabeth
warren's
calls
for
medicare
for
all
a
crackdown
on
gun
violence
and
the
end
of
the
fossil

industry
the
crowd
was
ethnically

heavily

hafermann
said
praising
the
leftward
shift
of
her
party's
politics
i
want
to
be
around
people
who
feel
the
same
way
the
dueling
scenes
illustrate
the
high-stakes
debate
playing
out
among
democrats
just
over
four
months
before
the
party
begins
to
select
its
next
presidential
nominee
while
the
party's
coastal
elites
demand
bold
liberal
policies
working
class
voters
in
the
midwest
are
warning
presidential
candidates
to
move
to
the
middle
or
risk
giving
president
donald
trump
another
four
years
in
the
white
house
the
highly
educated
urban
democrats
may
be
the
most
vocal
particularly
on
twitter
but
it
is
the
working
class
in
places
like
beaver
county
who
may
ultimately
decide
trump's
fate
none
of
the
dozen
or
so
union
workers
interviewed
at
a
protest
late
last
week
had
twitter
accounts
none
had
four-year
college
degrees
and
few
were
committed
to
voting
democrat
in
although
most
were
registered
as
such
daniel
keener
a
year-old
democrat
who
retired
after
more
than
two
decades
at
the
nearby
power
plant
said
his
party
has
moved
way
too
far
left
every
one
of
them
wants
to
take
my
gun
said
keener
motioning
to
the
handgun
clipped
to
his
left
pocket
he
said
he's
committed
to
trump
in
but
he'll
likely
maintain
his
democratic
registration
because
he's
a
union
man
and
his
family
has
a
long
history
with
the
party
republicans
suffered
sweeping
losses
in
the
midterm
elections
in
part
because
trump's
turbulent
leadership
style
and
divisive
policies
have
alienated
women
but
he
won
the
presidency
in
on
the
backs
of
working
class
men
in
pennsylvania
michigan
and
wisconsin
states
that
hadn't
backed

carried
in
where
democrats
had
a
registration
advantage
there
were
more
than
registered
democrats
and
registered
republicans
in
the
county
that
year
but
trump
ultimately
carried
beaver
county
by
almost
votes
according
to
data
compiled
by
the

the

was

as
bad

win

to

that
warren's
embrace
of
the

her

muted

about

she
encouraged

to
avoid

that
turn
off

like

mitko
acknowledged
that

is
complicated
her
local

committee
for

couldn't
find
even
three

agree
on

she's
encouraging

to
focus
on
jobs
and
education
we've

some
will
vote

there
are
a

they
laughed
when
asked

they
had

ankrom
said
he
voted

in
largely
because
he
didn't
want
to

hillary
clinton
looking
at
the
democratic
field
he
singled
out
warren
i'd
listen

ankrom

when
one

suggested
that
the
working

would
have
to
pay
higher
taxes
to
fund
warren's
policies
ankrom
backed
down
the
only
reason
he
was
slightly
open
to
warren
was
because
of
his
