ap
the
world's
largest
union
of
public
postal
services
opened
a
three-day
emergency
meeting
tuesday
to
discuss
the
trump
administration's
plans
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
group
it
helped
found
years
ago
a
high-level
white
house
envoy
at
the
universal
postal
union
meeting
in
geneva
told
delegates
he
was
personally
appealing
for
other
countries
to
back
washington's
call
for
an
overhaul
of
the
international
mail
system
upu's
extraordinary
congress
this
week
is
only
the
third
since
the
intergovernmental
body
was
created
in
to
smooth
international
mail
deliveries
leaders
said
about
of
its
member
nations
were
represented
at
the
meeting
devoted
to
the
u.s.
saying
it
would
withdraw
if
its
proposals
weren't
adopted
the
withdrawal
could
happen
as
soon
as
oct
the
trump
administration
insists
some
postal
carriers
such
as
china's
aren't
paying
enough
to
have
foreign
shipments
delivered
to
u.s.
recipients
and
argues
the
current
international
mail
system
is
ill-suited
for
st-century
boom
in
shipping
and
deliveries
because
of
e-commerce
the
white
house
dispatched
trump
trade
adviser
peter
navarro
who
is
considered
a
political
heavyweight
among
many
civil
servants
to
attend
the
meeting
in
geneva
in
brief
remarks
to
delegates
navarro
said
that
under
the
existing
system
the
united
states
is
forced
to
heavily
subsidize
the
importation
of
small
parcels
in
a
way
that
costs
our
postal
service
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
and
costs
our
economy
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
he
said
no
reasonable
person
could
support
the
existing
reimbursement
system
navarro
also
referenced
his
white
house
responsibilities
outside
postal
matters
saying
he's
been
involved
in
trade
negotiations
with
a
half-dozen
western
countries
and
helped
to
promote
the
defense
of
another
half-dozen
he
alluded
to
issues
like
removing
trade
barriers
with
the
european
union
reform
of
the
world
trade
organization
and
fair
share
financing
of
the
nato
alliance
from
this
broader
perspective
i
am
personally
asking
you
to
support
the
united
states
position
navarro
said
i
make
this
ask
because
in
times
like
these
where
no
reasonable
person
could
support
the
terminal
dues
system
this
is
what
friends
and
allies
do
for
each
other
the
mission
here
today
is
to
retool
this
system
for
the
brave
new
world
of
e-commerce
navarro
added
as
we
say
in
america
you
know
what
to
do
china's
envoy
said
her
country
opposed
the
option
most
supported
by
the
united
states
upu
secretary
general
bishar
hussein
of
kenya
said
he
was
very
optimistic
a
deal
could
be
reached
he
hoped
the
united
states
wouldn't
leave
the
organization
