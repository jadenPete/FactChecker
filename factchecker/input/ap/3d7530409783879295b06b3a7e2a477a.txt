democrats
blast
latest
trump
crisis
but
what
will
they
do
washington
ap
a
whistleblower's
complaint
over
president
donald
trump's
interactions
with
a
foreign
leader
is
testing
the
political
and
practical
power
democrats
can
use
against
a
republican
in
the
white
house
who
so
brazenly
ignores
protocol
and
presidential
norms
democrats
were
unanimous
in
their
condemnation
of
trump
for
going
to
extraordinary
lengths
to
tear
down
a
chief
political
rival
by
asking
the
new
leader
of
ukraine
to
investigate
the
son
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden
but
even
as
calls
for
impeachment
amplified
elizabeth
warren
blasted
congress
as
complicit
in
trump's
transgressions
there
were
no
signs
that
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
would
move
quickly
to
try
to
remove
the
president
allies
of
biden
the
early
front-runner
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
seized
on
the
developments
to
portray
him
as
the
candidate
trump
least
wants
to
face
next
fall
but
the
controversy
could
just
as
easily
revive
interest
in
the
business
activities
of
biden's
son
which
would
do
little
to
further
his
campaign
taken
together
the
developments
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
tumult
of
the
campaign
in
which
trump
was
accused
of
enlisting
a
foreign
power
to
help
him
win
an
election
the
president
on
saturday
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
his
most
vocal
allies
and
critics
were
energized
political
operatives
in
both
parties
suggested
that
for
many
increasingly
numb
to
a
constant
sense
of
crisis
the
fresh
explosion
of
political
drama
may
not
seem
so
alarming
one
thing
is
becoming
clear
trump
is
more
than
willing
to
cast
aside
norms
to
gain
a
political
advantage
jesse
ferguson
a
democratic
strategist
and
former
top
aide
to
hillary
clinton
said
the
country
has
to
be
ready
for
the
president
to
try
to
weaponize
the
government
against
them
in
a
way
we've
never
seen
before
in
american
history
the
president
on
saturday
embraced
the
parallels
to
the
campaign
and
predicted
he
would
prevail
again
in
trump
said
the
latest
allegations
from
a
government
whistleblower
are
just
as
ridiculous
as
the
others
branding
it
the
ukraine
witch
hunt
a
nod
to
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
probe
which
he
mocked
as
a
witch
hunt
will
fail
again
trump
tweeted
the
complaint
from
the
intelligence
community
whistleblower
is
based
on
a
series
of
events
including
what
sources
now
say
is
trump's
conversation
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
the
conversation
happened
on
july
just
a
day
after
mueller
wrapped
up
his
own
work
by
testifying
on
capitol
hill
trump
urged
zelenskiy
to
probe
the
activities
of
biden's
son
hunter
who
had
worked
for
a
ukrainian
gas
company
according
to
a
person
who
was
briefed
on
the
call
for
legal
scholars
and
ethics
watchdogs
the
interaction
between
trump
and
the
foreign
leader
is
seen
as
nothing
less
than
a
pressure
campaign
that
cuts
to
the
core
of
the
nation's
public
corruption
and
bribery
laws
it
came
as
the
white
house
was
holding
up
million
in
military
aid
for
ukraine
even
if
there
was
no
quid-pro-quo
from
the
president
the
conversation
could
be
seen
by
legal
experts
as
improper
it
appears
that
the
president
might
have
used
his
official
powers
in
particular
perhaps
the
threat
of
withholding
a
quarter-billion
dollars
in
military
aid
to
leverage
a
foreign
government
into
helping
him
defeat
a
potential
political
opponent
in
the
united
states
wrote
lawyer
george
t.
conway

who
is
married
to
a
top
trump
adviser
and
neal
katayal
a
georgetown
university
law
professor
and
former
acting
solicitor
general
in
an
op-ed
in
the
washington
post
if
trump
did
that
it
would
be
the
ultimate
impeachable
act
campaigning
in
iowa
on
saturday
joe
biden
said
the
president
deserves
to
be
investigated
but
he
stopped
short
of
calling
for
impeachment
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
biden
told
reporters
sen
chris
coons
d-del
said
trump's
actions
show
joe
biden
is
correctly
perceived
by
president
trump
as
the
greatest
threat
to
his
re-election
it's
less
clear
whether
the
situation
may
ultimately
hurt
biden
who
has
claimed
the
moral
high
ground
in
his
campaign
when
speaking
about
his
experience
as
vice
president
biden
often
says
he's
most
proud
of
the
lack
of
scandal
during
his
eight
years
in
the
obama
white
house
trump's
allies
hope
that
the
focus
on
biden's
involvement
in
ukraine
may
begin
to
chip
away
at
his
squeaky
clean
image
the
longer
we
talk
about
what
the
bidens
did
in
ukraine
the
better
said
barry
bennett
a
former
trump
campaign
adviser
who
dismissed
those
who
believe
trump
will
pay
a
political
price
for
the
latest
controversy
the
questions
about
hunter
biden
have
circulated
for
years
particularly
in
conservative
circles
after
he
was
hired
in
by
burisma
holdings
whose
founder
had
been
a
political
ally
of
russia-friendly
former
ukrainian
president
viktor
yanukovych
at
the
time
questions
were
raised
about
whether
the
ukrainian
firm
was
seeking
to
gain
influence
with
the
obama
administration
through
its
employment
of
joe
biden's
son
this
year
trump's
personal
lawyer
rudolph
giuliani
revived
interest
in
the
issue
and
said
he
reached
out
directly
to
the
ukrainian
government
joe
biden
said
he's
never
spoken
to
his
son
about
his
overseas
business
dealings
hunter
biden
has
denied
the
claims
that
he
used
his
influence
with
his
father
to
aid
burisma
saying
the
criticism
is
false
and
stoked
by
far-right
political
critics
while
sen
warren
and
other
democrats
say
there's
no
choice
but
to
start
impeachment
proceedings
other
democrats
have
been
reluctant
to
launch
a
process
they
say
could
scare
away
more
moderate
and
centrist
voters
especially
for
lawmakers
in
congress
pelosi
showed
no
signs
of
moving
off
her
position
that
congress
must
continue
to
investigate
the
administration
and
not
start
impeachment
proceedings
unless
the
american
public
demands
it
instead
she
said
that
trump
faces
repercussions
if
the
whistleblower's
allegations
prove
true
and
she
said
it's
time
to
change
the
law
to
make
sure
future
presidents
can
be
indicted
for
wrongdoing
democratic
strategist
jefrey
pollock
who
was
a
pollster
for
former
presidential
candidate
kirsten
gillibrand
suggested
that
the
latest
explosive
allegations
against
the
republican
president
would
have
little
impact
on
the
broader
debate
to
date
no
scandal
has
seemed
to
impact
donald
trump
on
its
own
pollock
said
and
the
fact
that
this
one
involves
a
political
rival
i
suspect
is
no
different
