dueling
wealth
tax
plans
may
prompt
sanders-warren
clash
washington
ap
bernie
sanders
announced
on
tuesday
a
plan
to
tax
the
nation's
wealthiest
households
saying
it
will
generate
more
than
trillion
over
the
next
decade
and
substantially
reduce
billionaires
fortunes
his
version
of
democratic
presidential
rival
elizabeth
warren's
signature
proposal
sanders
a
senator
from
vermont
and
warren
a
senator
from
massachusetts
are
longtime
friends
who
agree
on
many
major
policy
issues
and
have
so
far
steadfastly
refused
to
criticize
one
another
on
the
campaign
trail
but
the
dueling
wealth
taxes
signal
they
may
have
to
compete
more
directly
for
support
from
the
democratic
party's
liberal
wing
a
poll
released
in
the
key
early
voting
state
of
new
hampshire
showed
warren
outpacing
sanders
and
in
a
close
race
for
front
runner
status
in
a
packed
field
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
gains
built
in
part
on
her
drawing
support
from
both
the
plan
unveiled
by
sanders
seeks
a
levy
on
households
worth
more
than
million
and
proposes
tax
rates
that
would
increase
for
wealthier
people
up
to
for
billion-plus
fortunes
the
tax
would
affect
about
households
or
around
nationwide
according
to
gabriel
zucman
and
emmanuel
saez
economists
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
who
estimated
it
would
raise
about
trillion
in
government
revenue
by
the
budget
year
we
are
going
to
take
on
the
billionaire
class
substantially
reduce
wealth
inequality
in
america
and
stop
our
democracy
from
turning
into
a
corrupt
oligarchy
sanders
said
in
a
statement
warren
proudly
declares
herself
the
candidate
who
has
a
plan
for
everything
and
supports
a
wealth
tax
on
households
worth
more
than
million
and
has
become
so
well
known
for
the
issue
that
large
crowds
at
her
rallies
around
the
country
have
lately
interrupted
her
speeches
to
chant
cents
reminiscent
of
people
chanting
build
the
wall
at
president
donald
trump's
campaign
events
her
campaign
estimates
the
levy
would
raise
trillion
over
years
sanders
plan
goes
further
because
it
starts
on
fortunes
worth
at
least
million
far
lower
than
warren's
plan's
threshold
warren
also
proposes
increasing
the
wealth
tax
up
to
on
any
net
worth
of
more
than
billion
while
sanders
tax
rates
don't
top
out
until
for
the
richest
americans
zucman
and
saez
estimate
that
if
sanders
system
had
been
implemented
in
the
wealth
controlled
by
the
richest
americans
listed
on
the
forbes
would
be
only
of
what
it
is
today
a
progressive
wealth
tax
is
the
most
direct
policy
tool
to
curb
the
growing
concentration
of
wealth
in
the
united
states
the
economists
wrote
in
a
letter
analyzing
sanders
proposal
still
kyle
pomerleau
chief
economist
at
the
conservative
tax
foundation
called
sanders
proposal
more
extreme
than
what
warren
has
proposed
he
said
an
tax
on
assets
of
more
than
billion
would
likely
be
higher
than
the
investment
returns
on
those
holdings
such
that
billionaires
would
have
a
large
incentive
to
avoid
the
tax
the
proposed
tax
might
also
prove
an
unreliable
funding
stream
for
sanders
signature
issue
the
medicare
for
all
universal
health
insurance
program
which
warren
also
supports
a
wealth
tax
of
this
magnitude
would
tend
to
shrink
the
amount
of
wealth
held
by
billionaires
over
time
pomerleau
said
so
he
may
be
able
to
make
his
plans
add
up
in
the
short
run
but
it
becomes
more
questionable
over
time
as
the
wealth
tax
raises
less
and
less
sanders
says
that's
the
point
though
vowing
that
reducing
historic
levels
of
inequality
in
america
can
rebuild
the
nation's
middle
class
his
proposal
comes
as
warren
has
spent
months
on
the
rise
a
monmouth
university
poll
released
tuesday
showed
of
likely
primary
voters
in
new
hampshire
supporting
warren
slightly
more
than
biden
and
doubling
sanders
support
that
follows
a
weekend
poll
released
by
the
des
moines
register
cnn
and
mediacom
which
also
had
warren
narrowly
topping
the
field
in
the
state
that
kicks
off
the
democratic
nominating
contest
in
a
memo
emailed
to
supporters
on
tuesday
warren's
campaign
detailed
how
it
intends
to
keep
the
momentum
going
including
launching
an
advertising
buy
worth
million
in
iowa
and
the
next
three
states
voting
new
hampshire
nevada
and
south
carolina
roger
lau
warren's
campaign
manager
wrote
that
the
effort
will
be
focused
more
on
digital
mediums
rather
than
old-school
broadcast
television
and
mostly
feature
in-house
staff
making
videos
and
ads
not
the
consultant-driven
approach
of
other
campaigns
warren's
team
also
plans
to
expand
its
door-knocking
operations
and
its
calling
and
texting
of
would-be
supporters
while
hiring
state
directors
and
organizers
in
many
states
that
have
primaries
and
caucuses
in
march
like
delegate-rich
california
and
illinois
and
her
campaign
is
vowing
to
staff
up
in
places
it
describes
as
critical
for
maintaining
democratic
control
of
the
house
and
taking
back
the
senate
such
as
maine
and
georgia
we've
released
dozens
of
plans
in
the
past
seven
months
lau
wrote
but
they're
really
one
big
simple
plan
to
break
the
stranglehold
of
corruption
on
washington
and
put
political
and
economic
power
in
the
hands
of
the
people
where
it
belongs
