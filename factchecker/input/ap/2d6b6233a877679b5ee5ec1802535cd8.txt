trump
suggests
he
raised
the
bidens
with
ukraine's
president
washington
ap
president
donald
trump
suggested
that
he
raised
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
biden's
son
in
a
summer
phone
call
with
ukraine's
new
leader
as
democrats
pressed
for
investigations
into
whether
trump
improperly
used
his
office
to
try
to
dig
up
damaging
information
about
a
political
rival
trump
told
reporters
that
the
july
call
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelenskiy
was
congratulatory
and
focused
on
corruption
in
the
east
european
nation
in
his
remarks
to
reporters
he
then
raised
biden
as
an
example
although
there
is
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
biden
or
his
son
hunter
who
was
on
the
board
of
a
ukrainian
gas
company
it
was
largely
the
fact
that
we
don't
want
our
people
like
vice
president
biden
and
his
son
creating
to
the
corruption
already
in
the
ukraine
trump
said
as
he
left
the
white
house
for
a
trip
to
texas
biden
who
is
among
the
front-runners
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
accused
trump
of
making
a
baseless
political
smear
the
matter
has
sparked
a
fierce
debate
over
whether
trump
misused
his
office
for
political
gain
and
whether
his
administration
is
withholding
from
congress
critical
information
about
his
actions
the
incident
is
part
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
but
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
has
refused
to
share
details
with
lawmakers
citing
presidential
privilege
democratic
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
who
has
resisted
calls
for
impeachment
for
other
alleged
trump
transgressions
said
sunday
that
unless
maguire
provides
information
to
congress
administration
officials
will
be
entering
a
grave
new
chapter
of
lawlessness
which
will
take
us
into
a
whole
new
stage
of
investigation
another
impeachment
holdout
the
chairman
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
said
sunday
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
that
we
may
very
well
have
crossed
the
rubicon
here
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
has
told
the
associated
press
that
trump
urged
zelenskiy
to
investigate
hunter
biden
the
person
wasn't
authorized
to
discuss
the
issue
publicly
and
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
ukraine's
got
a
lot
of
problems
trump
said
at
the
white
house
the
new
president
is
saying
that
he's
going
to
be
able
to
rid
the
country
of
corruption
and
i
said
that
would
be
a
great
thing
we
had
a
great
conversation
we
had
a
conversation
on
many
things
hunter
biden
was
hired
by
the
ukrainian
gas
company
burisma
holdings
in
april
two
months
after
ukraine's
russia-friendly
president
was
ousted
by
protesters
and
as
his
father
was
heavily
involved
in
u.s.
efforts
to
support
the
new
pro-western
government
and
its
pledge
to
fight
corruption
the
hiring
of
the
younger
biden
immediately
raised
concerns
that
the
ukrainian
firm
whose
owner
was
a
political
ally
of
the
ousted
president
was
seeking
to
gain
influence
with
the
obama
administration
two
years
later
joe
biden
pressured
the
ukrainian
government
to
fire
the
prosecutor
general
who
was
accused
by
many
in
ukraine
and
in
the
west
of
being
soft
on
corruption
trump
has
claimed
that
the
prosecutor
who
had
led
an
investigation
into
burisma's
owner
was
after
hunter
biden
and
the
vice
president
was
trying
to
protect
his
son
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
trump
insisted
he
said
absolutely
nothing
wrong
in
the
call
to
zelenskiy
he
did
not
answer
directly
when
asked
whether
he
would
release
a
transcript
of
the
conversation
to
the
public
after
arriving
in
texas
trump
told
reporters
he
will
look
into
releasing
details
or
a
transcript
of
the
call
but
stressed
that
foreign
leaders
should
feel
free
to
speak
frankly
with
an
american
president
without
fear
that
the
details
of
their
conversations
will
later
be
disclosed
trump
said
if
ukraine
released
its
own
transcript
it
would
be
the
same
as
his
version
of
the
call
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
while
acknowledging
that
there
can
be
to
people
listening
in
on
such
calls
reiterated
trump's
position
that
foreign
leaders
need
to
be
able
to
speak
candidly
and
so
i
do
think
that
perhaps
releasing
this
kind
of
a
transcript
could
set
a
bad
precedent
grisham
said
on
fox
news
channel's
fox
friends
on
monday
he's
willing
to
do
it
i
think
but
there's
a
lot
of
other
people

the
such
that
may
have
a
problem

it

trump
last
month
placed
a
freeze
on
the
release
on
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
without
providing
an
excuse
raising
suspicions
among
his
democratic
critics
that
he
was
trying
to
squeeze
zelenskiy
the
aid
was
released
before

likely
rebuke
