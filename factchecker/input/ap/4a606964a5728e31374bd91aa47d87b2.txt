how
the
past
informs
trump's
vision
of
america's
future
washington
ap
president
donald
trump's
vision
of
america's
tomorrows
looks
much
like
its
yesterdays
he
loves
beautiful
coal
beautiful
warships
and
those
four
beautiful
words
made
in
the
usa
he
speaks
of
the
country's
might
as
measured
by
its
steel
mills
farms
and
cars
rolling
off
detroit
assembly
lines
he's
not
merely
summoning
happy
memories
his
nostalgia
shapes
policy
and
lives
too
trump
glorifies
the
muscle
and
sweat
but
not
the
labor
unions
of
those
who
toil
in
factories
and
till
the
soil
like
those
idealized
depictions
of
labor
in
century-old
murals
he
does
not
love
wind
power
he's
a
fossil
fuel
guy
a
meat
and
potatoes
man
too
he
steers
an
administration
that
reflects
not
just
his
agenda
but
his
pre-woke
diet
as
when
it
pulled
back
on
requirements
for
whole
grains
in
school
lunches
he's
had
it
out
for
those
newfangled
light
bulbs
for
years
ever
since
he
warned
flatly
and
falsely
that
they
can
cause
cancer
he
waves
off
modern
worries
about
global
warming
by
pointing
to
a
cold
snap
his
campaign
sells
plastic
straws
to
thumb
its
nose
at
what
trump
considers
political
correctness
meantime
the
world
moves
on
industry
technology
and
much
of
the
culture
are
finding
new
ways
of
doing
and
living
even
the
auto
industry
which
doesn't
like
being
told
by
government
what
to
do
has
found
itself
unhappy
about
how
trump
is
easing
fuel
economy
requirements
crusty
old
detroit
has
already
moved
on
from
its
most
gas-guzzling
days
and
invested
massively
in
more
efficient
vehicles
kicking
higher
even
as
trump
lowers
the
goal
posts
u.s.
prosperity
has
been
driven
for
decades
by
services
technology
and
new
things
not
the
grunt
work
of
old
that
is
celebrated
by
trump
he
sees
trade
in
terms
of
the
exchange
of
goods
and
he
ignores
services
where
long-standing
u.s.
strength
in
global
competitiveness
does
not
fit
his
world
view
of
an
america
under
siege
by
rapacious
traders
like
china
we
are
bringing
back
he
likes
to
say
and
always
with
exaggeration
we
are
bringing
back
america
faster
than
anyone
thought
possible
we
are
bringing
back
our
factories
we
are
bringing
back
our
jobs
and
we
are
bringing
back
those
four
beautiful
words
made
in
the
usa
all
those
things
come
from
the
s
and
s
said
irving
rein
a
professor
of
communications
at
northwestern
university
who
has
studied
cultural
trends
for
more
than
a
half
century
he
says
that
when
trump
cheers
things
such
as
king
coal
big
steel
and
trade
protectionism
with
the
big
beautiful
tariff
on
china
he
knows
his
audience
a
largely
older
one
that
takes
comfort
in
a
filtered
view
of
the
past
yet
modernity
advances
popular
culture
is
like
a
river
it
just
kind
of
floats
by
rein
said
some
of
it
stays
and
trump
has
captured
those
eddies
in
his
own
way
joe
biden
has
too
while
disagreeing
with
the
year-old
trump
on
almost
all
of
the
above
the
year-old
democratic
presidential
hopeful
invokes
a
time
of
comity
between
political
opponents
the
feeling
that
nostalgically
there
was
more
compromise
rein
said
and
holds
out
the
prospect
of
bringing
back
those
days
this
while
trump
and
most
of
biden's
rivals
seem
ready
to
lunge
at
each
other
trump's
throwback
tendencies
are
not
unique
in
leadership
ronald
reagan
could
be
steeped
in
sentimentality
too
if
without
the
sharp
edges
of
this
president
constantine
sedikides
a
psychology
professor
who
studies
nostalgia
from
britain's
university
of
southampton
said
right-wing
populists
in
europe
have
romanticized
the
past
to
advance
goals
such
as
britain's
exit
from
the
european
union
and
the
marginalization
of
outgroups
such
as
islamic
migrants
and
refugees
trump
is
using
collective
nostalgia
sentimental
longing
about
the
country's
rosy
past
to
his
political
advantage
sedikides
said
by
email
by
its
nature
such
cultural
observers
say
collective
nostalgia
is
history
seen
through
a
veil
with
old
hardships
and
prejudices
put
out
of
mind
in
favor
of
wistful
remembrance
you
cherry-pick
things
rein
said
some
of
trump's
retro
impulses
are
reflected
by
now
in
law
or
in
the
lifting
of
regulations
a
trend
most
pronounced
when
it
fits
his
pro-industry
conservatism
as
well
this
past
week
his
administration
barred
california's
longtime
authority
to
set
stricter
car
and
truck
emission
standards
than
federal
rules
require
nearly
half
the
states
sued
to
block
the
trump
administration's
action
which
by
its
own
reckoning
is
likely
to
result
in
additional
fuel
consumption
of
barrels
a
day
the
auto
industry
instead
of
being
relieved
warned
that
their
vehicles
will
become
less
competitive
globally
if
the
incentive
to
increase
fuel
efficiency
is
lost
trump
called
them
politically
correct
automobile
companies
trump
has
eased
up
a
variety
of
environmental
regulations
in
part
to
serve
his
interest
in
reviving
coal
but
that
effort
is
up
against
forces
of
the
modern
free
market
awash
in
natural
gas
as
utilities
continue
closing
coal-fired
plants
in
favor
of
energy
sources
that
are
cleaner
cheaper
or
both
this
month
the
administration
slowed
a
long
push
by
congress
to
wean
the
country
from
old-time
incandescent
bulbs
in
favor
of
leds
and
other
lights
that
use
less
energy
trump
argues
the
savings
aren't
worth
it
consumers
should
have
a
choice
and
under
those
new
bulbs
i
always
look
orange
and
so
do
you
he
told
a
republican
gathering
as
if
realizing
he
has
been
associated
with
that
color
anyway
