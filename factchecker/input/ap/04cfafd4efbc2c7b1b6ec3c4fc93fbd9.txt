joe
arpaio
is
running
for
his
old
job
as
sheriff
fountain
hills
ariz
ap
in
a
memorabilia-packed
office
that
could
serve
as
a
museum
to
his
career
joe
arpaio
plots
how
he
might
at
the
age
of
get
back
his
old
job
as
the
sheriff
of
metro
phoenix
the
man
who
became
a
national
lightning
rod
for
immigration
loved
by
some
and
loathed
by
others
spends
his
days
at
an
office
in
a
strip
mall
in
the
affluent
suburb
of
fountain
hills
he
talks
to
reporters
takes
calls
from
supporters
on
his
flip
phone
and
pecks
out
self-promotional
blurbs
on
a
smith
corona
typewriter
that
an
assistant
later
transcribes
and
posts
on
social
media
he
rejects
suggestions
that
he's
running
to
stroke
his
ego
quench
a
thirst
for
publicity
or
lessen
any
boredom
since
getting
booted
from
office
a
criminal
conviction
contempt
of
court
for
disobeying
a
judge's
order
in
a
racial
profiling
case
to
stop
his
traffic
patrols
that
targeted
immigrants
remains
stuck
in
his
craw
though
he
insists
he's
not
out
to
clear
his
name
instead
he
says
he
wants
to
do
whatever
he
can
to
support
president
donald
trump
whose
pardon
of
the
lawman
hangs
prominently
on
a
wall
next
to
arpaio's
desk
he
also
vows
to
bring
back
the
things
that
garnered
notoriety
during
his
years
as
maricopa
county's
top
law
enforcer
immigration
crackdowns
a
complex
of
jail
tents
and
other
now-discarded
trademarks
that
courts
have
deemed
illegal
or
his
successor
has
done
away
with
i
just
have
a
desire
to
get
back
into
the
fight
and
do
what
i
can
do
to
finish
my
career
arpaio
said
his
phone
buzzing
throughout
the
interview
it's
hard
to
explain
it
it's
hard
to
explain
it
honestly
to
you
hard
his
odds
at
winning
next
year's
election
are
long
democrat
paul
penzone
a
retired
phoenix
police
sergeant
trounced
the
republican
arpaio
by
nearly
points
in
arpaio's
first
political
comeback
attempt
ended
badly
when
he
placed
third
in
the
gop
senate
primary
losing
in
maricopa
county
and
his
adopted
hometown
of
fountain
hills
much
like
trump
who
also
has
made
an
immigration
crackdown
a
centerpiece
of
his
re-election
bid
arpaio
is
known
for
saying
things
that
other
politicians
wouldn't
or
couldn't
get
away
with
but
defiance
and
loose
management
led
to
a
pileup
of
political
baggage
million
in
taxpayer-funded
legal
bills
a
failure
to
investigate
more
than
sex-crimes
complaints
made
to
his
office
a
racial
profiling
verdict
that
discredited
his
immigration
patrols
and
his
own
conviction
he'll
have
a
little
base
within
the
republican
party
but
i
suspect
there
is
reticence
over
his
candidacy
that
might
pull
him
down
said
pollster
mike
o'neil
a
longtime
arizona
pollster
who
has
followed
arpaio's
career
people
who
have
known
arpaio
for
decades
offer
varying
reasons
for
his
run
whenever
joe
calls
me
he
says
tom
this
is
the
sheriff
said
payson
mayor
tom
morrissey
a
retired
chief
u.s.
marshal
and
a
longtime
arpaio
friend
he
doesn't
see
himself
as
joe
that's
his
identity
being
the
sheriff
jerry
sheridan
arpaio's
former
second-in-command
who
will
face
his
old
boss
in
the
gop
primary
for
sheriff
said
he
was
disappointed
when
arpaio
backed
out
of
a
promise
to
support
his
campaign
i
think
what
he
fails
to
realize
is
that
his
time
is
over
because
the
people
after
years
have
made
it
clear
they
don't
want
him
back
said
sheridan
arpaio
acknowledged
early
conversations
about
sheridan's
candidacy
but
sums
up
with
this
people
have
a
right
to
change
their
minds
and
run
for
office
arpaio
isn't
running
because
he
needs
money
he
has
two
pensions
one
from
his
earlier
year
tenure
as
a
federal
drug
enforcement
administration
agent
and
another
from
his
second
career
as
sheriff
and
he
and
his
wife
of
years
ava
own
a
home
valued
at
and
nearly
million
in
commercial
real
estate
ava
arpaio
says
she
and
her
two
children
support
his
run
for
office
she
says
he
has
no
hobbies
and
was
never
going
to
have
a
conventional
retirement
he
loves
his
work
and
would
like
to
get
back
into
it
ava
said
arpaio
says
he
remains
mentally
sharp
and
in
good
health
though
he
takes
medication
for
high
blood
pressure
without
the
body
guards
who
picked
him
up
for
work
for
years
in
a
government-owned
vehicle
arpaio
now
drives
a
cadillac
to
his
personal
office
since
losing
in
arpaio
has
kept
occupied
by
making
social
media
posts
about
his
beefs
with
other
politicians
traveling
across
the
country
to
speak
to
republican
groups
and
endorsing
a
colorful
list
of
candidates
he
endorsed
an
india-born
candidate
who
ran
on
the
slogan
only
a
real
indian
can
defeat
the
fake
indian
in
the
race
won
by
sen
elizabeth
warren
a
losing
senate
candidate
in
missouri
who
made
a
social
media
post
that
railed
against
nail-biting
manophobic
hell-bent
feminist
she
devils
and
dennis
hof
the
nevada
pimp-turned-politician
whose
birthday
bash
was
attended
by
arpaio
porn
star
ron
jeremy
and
tax-cut
activist
grover
norquist
just
hours
before
hof
died
of
a
heart
attack
arpaio
says
the
candidates
seeking
his
endorsement
want
to
talk
about
his
background
illegal
immigration
his
jail
tents
and
criminal
contempt
case
i
naturally
talk
about
trump
arpaio
said
his
reversal
of
fortune
became
evident
a
month
after
his
august
pardon
when
he
made
an
embarrassing
appearance
on
comedian
sacha
baron
cohen's
prank
show
cohen
portraying
a
finnish
tv
host
who
channeled
his
questions
through
a
tiny
toy
doughnut
got
arpaio
to
argue
the
benefits
of
gun
ownership
with
the
toy
and
tricked
the
lawman
into
answering
questions
dripping
with
sexual
innuendo
arpaio
once
a
master
at
garnering
publicity
acknowledges
that
he
might
not
have
appeared
on
the
show
if
he
still
had
the
public
relations
staff
while
he
was
sheriff
i
got
played
he
said
in
a
recent
arizona
republic
podcast
arpaio
said
he
would
go
to
bars
to
court
hispanic
voters
but
in
an
interview
days
later
with
the
associated
press
arpaio
insisted
that
he
never
said
he'd
go
to
bars
to
appeal
to
latinos
he
refers
to
people
in
the
united
states
without
authorization
as
illegals
despite
knowing
that
many
people
consider
it
dehumanizing
and
made
a
tweet
this
summer
that
promoted
his
work
on
a
tough
black
beat
in
his
s
as
a
police
officer
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood
in
washington
d.c.
arpaio
says
he
has
a
soft
spot
for
people
from
other
countries
and
that
his
parents
immigrated
to
the
united
states
from
italy
he
also
says
his
daughter-in-law
is
hispanic
one
of
his
grandchildren
is
black
and
another
grandchild
is
of
mexican
descent
lydia
guzman
a
latino
civil
rights
advocate
and
longtime
arpaio
critic
sharply
denounced
arpaio
for
the
comment
about
talking
to
hispanics
at
bars
he
might
as
well
have
said
i'm
looking
for
the
hispanic
vote
and
i'm
going
to
the
welfare
lines
for
that
said
guzman
that
statement
was
only
there
to
offend
as
he
yearns
to
return
to
his
heyday
arpaio
remains
doggedly
unrepentant
about
how
he
ran
the
agency
his
immigration
crackdowns
and
actions
that
led
to
his
contempt
conviction
even
if
he
were
to
apologize
he
says
critics
would
still
hate
him
as
for
the
calls
to
be
more
sensitive
in
talking
about
race
arpaio
sees
a
cynical
motivation
at
play
i
don't
go
along
with
this
political
correctness
crap
all
the
time
to
get
votes
