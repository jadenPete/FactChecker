new

ap
swedish
teenage
climate
activist
greta
thunberg
said
she's
overwhelmed
by
the
success
of
friday's
climate
protests
but
the
year-old
who
sparked
the
global
movement
said
she
was
underwhelmed
by
the
united
states
government's
approach
to
climate
change
thunberg
spoke
with
the
associated
press
as
the
climate
events
were
underway
responses
have
been
edited
for
length
and
clarity
did
you
think
you'd
get
numbers
like
this
when
you
started
it's
just
such
a
victory
i
would
never
have
predicted
or
believed
that
this
was
going
to
happen
someday
and
so
fast
only
in
months
i
can't
wait
to
see
the
official
numbers
come
in
it
will
be
magnificent
i
think
if
enough
people
get
together
and
stand
up
for
this
then
that
can
have
a
huge
difference
to
put
pressure
on
the
people
in
power
to
actually
hold
them
accountable
and
to
say
you
need
to
do
something
now
what's
your
impression
of
the
political
situation
in
the
united
states
around
climate
change
it's
a
bit
worse
than
in
other
countries
the
arguments
for
continuing
to
not
do
anything
and
the
empty
words
and
promises
and
lies
are
the
same
some
countries
are
more
extreme
than
others
but
it's
not
much
different
what
do
you
expect
from
the
upcoming
climate
action
summit
we
must
hope
but
we
must
also
be
prepared
for
that
nothing
comes
out
of
it
and
then
we
need
to
continue
no
matter
what
giving
up
cannot
be
an
option
indeed
this
is
a
great
opportunity
to
do
something
and
they
leaders
should
take
that
otherwise
they
should
feel
ashamed
people
who
deny
climate
change
have
attacked
you
personally
how
do
you
deal
with
that
it's
sad
you
just
have
to
ignore
them
because
they
are
just
desperately
trying
to
remove
the
focus
from
the
climate
crisis
to
make
it
something
about
me
as
an
individual
rather
than
the
crisis
itself
when
they
do
that
they
don't
have
any
arguments
left
