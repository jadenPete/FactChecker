uaw
strike
puts
trump
gop
in
political
bind
in
key
states
lansing
mich
ap
democrats
were
quick
to
back
working-class
united
auto
workers
in
their
strike
against
general
motors
delivering
doughnuts
and
holding
picket
signs
outside
factories
to
show
solidarity
it's
a
union
they
long
have
aligned
with
politically
there
were
no
doughnuts
from
republicans
led
by
president
donald
trump
gop
officials
have
largely
avoided
taking
sides
in
the
strike
that
threatens
to
upend
the
economy
in
michigan
an
election
battleground
a
year
before
the
vote
both
here
and
nationally
most
republicans
said
little
about
the
substance
of
the
dispute
beyond
hope
for
a
speedy
resolution
the
muted
response
reflects
the
tricky
politics
of
labor
for
republicans
trump
has
made
inroads
with
members
of
some
unions
due
partly
to
promises
to
get
tough
on
trade
and
keep
manufacturing
jobs
in
the
united
states
the
message
pulled
key
voters
away
from
their
democratic
union
bosses
who
trump
argues
are
corrupt
but
a
strike
prompted
in
part
over
gm's
plan
to
close
american
plants
highlights
trump's
unfulfilled
promises
on
manufacturing
and
gives
democrats
a
chance
to
play
up
their
union
credentials
democratic
presidential
candidate
elizabeth
warren
planned
to
show
up
on
the
picket
line
in
michigan
on
sunday
with
rival
bernie
sanders
expected
this
coming
week
nearly
all
the
candidates
have
tweeted
support
for
the
workers
proud
to
stand
with
uaw
to
demand
fair
wages
and
benefits
for
their
members
america's
workers
deserve
better

biden
tweeted
the
union
says
biden
will
be
at
a
picket
line
in
at
the
fairfax
plant
in
kansas
city
kansas
on
sunday
trump
is
in
a
bind
backing
the
union
would
undermine
trump's
message
that
labor
does
not
advocate
for
its
workers
and
give
a
powerful
democratic
force
a
boost
before
an
election
siding
with
gm
would
call
into
question
his
promises
to
defend
workers
and
he
would
risk
getting
blamed
for
economic
woes
in
rust
belt
states
he
needs
to
win
reelection
his
task
gets
tougher
the
longer
the
strike
goes
on
there
is
a
history
of
this
issue
being
treacherous
in
michigan
said
michigan
state
university
political
scientist
matt
grossmann
he
noted
that
republican
mitt
romney's
presidential
campaign
suffered
in
when
democrats
pointed
repeatedly
to
an
opinion
article
he
wrote
opposing
the
auto
bailout
the
headline
let
detroit
go
bankrupt
it
is
treacherous
to
be
against
the
autoworkers
grossmann
said
the
president
has
appeared
mindful
of
the
dilemma
saying
little
about
the
strike
on
monday
the
first
day
of
the
walkout
he
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
the
dispute
was
sad
and
he
made
a
distinction
between
workers
and
their
union
leaders
i
don't
want
general
motors
to
be
building
plants
outside
of
this
country
he
said
my
relationship
has
been
very
powerful
with
the
auto
workers
not
necessarily
the
top
person
or
two
but
the
people
that
work
doing
automobiles
the
strike
is
playing
out
as
a
federal
corruption
investigation
against
top
uaw
officials
widens
the
fbi
raided
uaw
president
gary
jones
suburban
detroit
home
last
month
and
prosecutors
have
charged
people
in
the
investigation
so
far
leading
many
of
the
workers
nationwide
to
question
whether
leaders
have
their
backs
trump
may
be
wise
to
try
to
separate
union
workers
from
their
leaders
although
union
members
have
historically
supported
democrats
trump's
promises
to
rewrite
free
trade
agreements
appeared
to
resonate
with
many
in
manufacturing
areas
nationally
union
members
were
just
slightly
more
likely
than
other
voters
to
support
democrats
in
when
the
party
gained
control
of
the
house
six
in
union
voters
supported
democratic
candidates
in
house
races
according
to
ap
votecast
a
survey
of
more
than
midterm
voters
nationwide
but
trump
has
struggled
to
make
good
on
promises
to
stop
companies
from
shipping
jobs
overseas
from
the
first
announcement
in
he
was
quick
to
criticize
gm
for
wanting
to
close
u.s.
plants
an
issue
at
the
center
of
current
fight
he
met
with
ceo
mary
barra
at
the
white
house
on
sept
days
after
suggesting
the
company
should
move
jobs
from
china
to
the
u.s.
gm
has
not
been
persuaded
yet
trump's
escalation
of
the
trade
war
with
china
has
hurt
manufacturers
with
factories
in
michigan
wisconsin
and
pennsylvania
shedding
workers
since
the
end
of
according
to
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
his
administration's
decision
to
stop
california
from
setting
its
own
emission
standards
for
cars
and
trucks
also
has
created
uncertainty
in
the
industry
if
this
strike
goes
into
a
second
week
you're
going
to
see
parts
of
michigan
go
into
a
recession
said
patrick
anderson
ceo
of
the
anderson
economic
group
an
east
lansing-based
consulting
firm
whose
work
includes
analyzing
the
auto
industry
parts
of
michigan
are
feeling
it
today
you're
already
seeing
losses
in
income
and
people
cutting
back
on
their
spending
there
is
some
expectation
that
trump
will
intervene
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
that
but
the
white
house
denied
a
report
this
past
week
that
it
engaged
in
talks
with
the
company
and
the
union
michigan-based
republican
strategist
john
sellek
said
he
believes
trump
is
on
the
side
of
the
workers
but
is
trying
to
thread
the
needle
and
not
blow
up
gm's
offer
to
save
a
plant
or
two
that
fits
his
electoral
victory
path
and
it
fits
his
policy
positions
on
trade
he
said
he's
walking
a
more
careful
path
rhetorically
for
now
but
if
he
decides
on
any
given
day
that
it's
time
to
jump
in
with
both
feet
we
shouldn't
be
surprised
that
he
does
gm's
proposal
includes
creating
an
electric
vehicle
battery
assembly
plant
in
lordstown
ohio
where
the
company
is
in
the
process
of
closing
a
small-car
assembly
plant
in
addition
gm
would
pay
for
an
electric
pickup
truck
that
would
go
into
the
detroit-hamtramck
plant
which
the
company
also
wants
to
close
the
lordstown
facility
would
offer
lower
wages
according
to
a
person
briefed
on
the
matter
who
was
not
authorized
to
publicly
discuss
the
matter
and
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
union
wants
to
add
jobs
that
pay
the
top
uaw
wage
gm
workers
who
were
picketing
friday
outside
the
grand
river
factory
in
lansing
one
that
makes
cadillacs
and
chevy
camaros
were
mixed
on
whether
trump
should
weigh
in
many
said
their
top
priority
is
giving
temporary
workers
a
path
to
permanent
jobs
others
also
want
commitments
that
vehicles
would
be
made
in
the
u.s.
keith
cannon
of
lansing
said
trump
whom
he
does
not
back
should
engage
he
interpreted
trump's
remarks
about
the
strike
as
being
supportive
of
workers
it's
important
because
it
affects
the
country
he's
running
said
cannon
a
year
gm
worker
who
as
a
uaw
district
committeeman
represents
workers
in
disputes
with
management
he
should
weigh
in
on
it
because
ultimately
we
affect
the
community
you
have
restaurants
stores
businesses
that
rely
on
us
to
support
them
as
much
as
they
support
us
with
their
services
cannon
said
he
cannot
spend
much
locally
while
living
on
strike
