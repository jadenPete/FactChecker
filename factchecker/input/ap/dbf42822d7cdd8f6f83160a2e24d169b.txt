asylum

new
york
ap
the
united
states
on
friday
signed
an
agreement
that
paves
the
way
for
the
u.s.
to
send
many
asylum-seekers
to
one
of
the
world's
most
violent
countries
el
salvador
but
both
countries
must
first
take
necessary
legal
actions
and
implement
major
border
security
and
asylum
procedures
before
it
would
go
into
effect
according
to
a
draft
copy
of
the
agreement
obtained
by
the
associated
press
the
deal
is
the
latest
ambitious
step
taken
by
the
trump
administration
to
lean
on
other
nations
many
of
them
notoriously
violent
to
take
in
immigrants
to
stop
the
flow
of
migrants
to
the
u.s.
mexico
border
u.s.
immigration
officials
also
are
forcing
more
than
people
to
remain
in
mexico
as
their
cases
play
out
and
have
changed
policy
to
deny
asylum
to
anyone
who
transited
through
a
third
country
en
route
to
the
southern
border
of
the
u.s.
curbing
immigration
is
a
signature
political
issue
for
trump
and
one
that
thrills
his
supporters
but
the
u.s.
is
also
managing
a
crush
of
migrants
at
the
border
that
has
strained
the
system
acting
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
and
el
salvador's
foreign
minister
alexandra
hill
tinoco
signed
the
cooperative
asylum
agreement
in
a
live-streamed
press
conference
on
friday
they
lauded
the
two
countries
for
working
together
to
stem
migration
to
the
u.s.
but
provided
few
details
about
the
agreement
condemnation
from
migrant
and
refugee
advocates
was
swift
where
will
they
declare
a
haven
for
asylum
seekers
next
syria
north
korea
this
is
cynical
and
absurd
el
salvador
is
in
no
way
safe
for
asylum
seekers
said
refugees
international
president
eric
schwartz
meghan
lopez
country
director
for
el
salvador
at
the
international
rescue
committee
said
the
u.s.
government
is
attempting
once
more
to
turn
its
back
on
extremely
vulnerable
people
el
salvador
is
not
safe
for
many
of
its
own
nationals
and
is
struggling
to
meet
their
needs
which
is
why
many
seek
asylum
in
the
united
states
it
is
unrealistic
to
expect
el
salvador
to
be
able
to
offer
protection
to
asylum-seekers
fleeing
conditions
comparable
to
those
in
el
salvador
el
salvadorans
are
excluded
from
the
agreement
according
to
the
draft
mcaleenan
who
called
the
agreement
a
big
step
forward
and
hill
tinoco
discussed
u.s.
assistance
in
making
el
salvador
a
safer
and
more
prosperous
place
for
its
citizens
hill
tinoco
talked
about
ending
gang
violence
i
mean
those
individuals
threaten
people
those
individuals
kill
people
those
individuals
request
for
the
poorest
and
most
vulnerable
population
to
pay
just
to
cross
the
street
she
said
adding
that
her
country
needs
more
investment
from
the
u.s.
and
other
nations
the
agreement
first
reported
by
the
associated
press
could
lead
to
migrants
from
third
countries
obtaining
refuge
in
el
salvador
if
they
pass
through
that
country
on
their
way
to
the
u.s.
hill
tinoco
said
in
an
interview
with
the
ap
but
she
said
most
migrants
who
travel
north
don't
pass
through
el
salvador
which
is
on
the
western
edge
of
central
america
and
is
much
smaller
geographically
than
its
neighbor
to
the
east
honduras
she
told
the
ap
the
details
would
need
to
be
hammered
out
including
border
security
asylum
procedures
and
potential
aid
from
the
u.s.
she
said
the
agreement
is
a
starting
point
and
they
expected
negotiations
on
possible
aid
to
continue
it
has
to
be
a
real
partnership
she
said
which
means
the
u.s.
would
have
to
give
something
the
country's
new
president
nayib
bukele
has
made
clear
he
wishes
to
be
an
ally
to
the
u.s.
hill
tinoco
said
it
is
a
complete
in
terms
of
foreign
policy
she
said
mcaleenan
said
the
agreement
advanced
el
salvador's
commitment
to
developing
an
asylum
framework
with
help
from
the
u.n.
high
commissioner
for
refugees
this
will
build
on
the
good
work
we
have
accomplished
already
with
el
salvador's
neighbor
guatemala
in
building
protection
capacity
to
try
to
further
our
efforts
to
provide
opportunities
to
seek
protection
for
political
racial
religious
or
social
group
persecution
as
close
as
possible
to
the
origin
of
individuals
that
need
it
he
said
guatemala
officials
are
still
working
on
how
to
implement
a
safe
third
country
agreement
with
the
u.s.
signed
earlier
this
summer
the
arrangement
with
el
salvador
was
not
described
as
a
safe
third
country
agreement
under
which
nations
agree
that
their
respective
countries
are
safe
enough
and
have
robust
enough
asylum
systems
so
that
if
migrants
transit
through
one
of
the
countries
they
must
remain
there
instead
of
moving
on
to
another
country
the
u.s.
officially
has
only
one
such
agreement
in
place
with
canada
the
trump
administration
this
year
threatened
to
withhold
all
federal
assistance
to
el
salvador
guatemala
and
honduras
unless
they
did
more
to
end
the
migrant
crisis
the
move
was
met
by
stiff
resistance
in
congress
as
experts
had
said
the
cuts
would
likely
only
exacerbate
the
number
of
migrants
seeking
to
make
the
hazardous
journey
to
the
u.s.
because
of
a
further
lack
of
resources
on
thursday
the
u.s.
announced
a
plan
to
promote
economic
development
in
mexico
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
as
long
as
fewer
migrants
end
up
at
the
u.s.
border
mauricio

national

said
u.s.
investment
would
occur
soon
but
it
was
contingent
on
a
continued
reduction
in
the
number
of
migrants

specify
how
much
washington
plans
to
give
to
promote
economic
growth
in

countries
in
june
the

department
announced
that
the
trump
administration
was
reversing
some
of
the
cuts
but
would
not
approve
future
aid
to
those
nations
the
state
department
said
then
that
some
million
from
the
budget
will
not
be
spent
and
instead
will
be
moved
to
other
projects

by
