behind

joe
biden
was
at
the
forefront
of
american
diplomatic
efforts
to
support
ukraine's
fragile
democratic
government
as
it
sought
to
fend
off
russian
aggression
and
root
out
corruption
so
it
raised
eyebrows
when
biden's
son
hunter
was
hired
by
a
ukrainian
gas
company
the
obama
white
house
said
at
the
time
that
there
was
no
conflict
because
the
younger
biden
was
a
private
citizen
and
there's
been
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
either
biden
yet
the
matter
is
back
in
the

prodded
ukraine's
president
to
help
him
investigate
any
corruption

of
viktor
yanukovych
ukraine's
russia-friendly
president
who
was
driven
out
in

by
mass
protests
yanukovych's
ouster
prompted
the
obama
administration
to
move
quickly
to
deepen
ties
with
ukraine's
new
government
joe
biden
played
a
leading
role
traveling
to
ukraine
and
speaking
frequently
with
its
new
western-friendly
president
the
younger
biden's
business
role
raised
concerns
among
anticorruption
advocates
that
burisma
was
seeking
to
gain
influence
with
the
obama
administration
at
the
time
the
company

said
he
never
speaks
to
his
son
about
his
overseas
business
dealings
the
matter
however
has
continued
to
be
questioned
by
trump
and
his
allies
they've
pointed
in
particular
to
biden's
move
in
march
to
pressure
the
ukrainian
government
to
fire
its
top
prosecutor
viktor
shokin
who
had
previously
led
an
investigation
into
burisma's
owner
biden
was
representing
the
official
position
of
the
u.s.
government
a
position
that
was
also
supported
by
other
western
governments
and
many
in

who
accused
shokin
of
being
soft
on
corruption
