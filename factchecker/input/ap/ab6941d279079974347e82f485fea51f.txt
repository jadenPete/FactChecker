ap
britain's
prime
minister
has
promised
to
tell
u.s.
president
donald
trump
that
any
notion
of
american
firms
buying
parts
of
the
u.k.
s
beloved
state-funded
health
service
will
be
off
the
table
in
future
trade
negotiations
and
that
the
united
states
will
have
to
open
its
markets
to
british
goods
if
it
wants
to
make
a
deal
boris
johnson
said
he
would
draw
his
red
lines
for
the
protectionist
president
when
the
two
leaders
meet
this
week
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
he
also
planned
to
tell
u.s.
business
leaders
and
politicians
that
britain
will
have
a
loosely
regulated
market
that
is
open
to
the
world
after
it
leaves
the
european
union
johnson
arrived
at
the
global
gathering
on
monday
with
a
balancing
act
to
effect
he's
trying
to
persuade
european
union
leaders
to
strike
an
elusive
divorce
deal
with
britain
while
also
laying
the
groundwork
for
a
post-brexit
trade
agreement
with
the
united
states
seen
by
the
government
as
one
of
the
main
prizes
of
brexit
the
conservative
prime
minister
is
keen
to
forge
a
strong
relationship
with
the
republican
president
who
has
called
the
british
leader
a
really
good
man
but
johnson
told
reporters
flying
with
him
to
new
york
that
he
would
tell
trump
that
when
we
do
a
free
trade
deal
we
must
make
sure
that
the
national
health
service
is
not
on
the
table
that
we
do
not
in
any
way
prejudice
or
jeopardize
our
standards
on
animal
welfare
and
food
hygiene
in
the
course
of
that
deal
and
that
we
open
up
american
markets
he
also
said
the
u.s.
would
have
to
accept
british
lamb
and
beef
which
are
barred
and
lower
tariffs
on
manufactured
british
goods
opponents
of
brexit
fear
the
nhs
an
overstretched
but
much-loved
institution
founded
in
to
provide
free
health
care
to
all
britons
will
be
opened
to
private
u.s.
firms
as
part
of
trade
negotiations
they
also
have
suggested
britain
may
have
to
accept
chlorine-washed
chicken
a
u.s.
poultry
industry
practice
that
is
banned
in
the
european
union
johnson's
political
opponents
and
eu
leaders
worry
that
post-brexit
britain
wants
to
become
a
low-tax
low-regulation
economy
what
some
have
dubbed
a
singapore
on
thames
johnson
is
likely
to
stir
those
fears
tuesday
when
he
plans
to
tell
u.s.
and
canadian
business
leaders
the
u.k.
will
roll
out
the
red
carpet
for
investors
johnson's
office
said
he
would
say
that
we
want
a
market
that
is
open
to
the
world
with
the
most
competitive
tax
rates
and
the
best
skilled
workforce
in
the
hemisphere
johnson
is
likely
to
be
dogged
by
britain's
divisive
and
stalled
departure
from
the
eu
throughout
his
three-day
trip
to
the
u.n.
s
annual
gathering
of
world
leaders
more
than
three
years
after
britain
voted
to
leave
the
eu
the
departure
date
has
been
postponed
twice
and
the
u.k.
parliament
has
repeatedly
rejected
the
only
divorce
deal
offered
the
country
is
facing
a
chaotic
exit
on
oct
unless
johnson's
government
can
against
the
odds
secure
a
new
agreement
or
arrange
another
delay
something
johnson
vows
he
will
not
do
the
british
leader
is
seeking
to
persuade
a
skeptical
european
union
to
give
britain
a
new
divorce
deal
before
the
u.k.
is
due
to
leave
the
bloc
on
oct
johnson
said
he
didn't
think
there
would
be
a
new
york
breakthrough
in
meetings
with
european
leaders
at
the
u.n.
but
he
was
encouraged
by
the
progress
talks
had
made
since
he
took
office
less
than
two
months
ago
he
replaced
theresa
may
who
resigned
in
failure
after
her
eu
withdrawal
agreement
was
rejected
three
times
by
parliament
i
think
a
large
number
of
the
important
partners
really
do
want
a
deal
he
said
they
may
want
a
deal
but
many
leaders
of
the
nation
bloc
mistrust
johnson
a
brash
brexit
champion
who
played
a
big
role
in
persuading
british
voters
in
to
opt
to
leave
the
eu
and
they
say
britain
has
not
come
up
with
proposals
for
maintaining
an
open
border
between
eu
member
ireland
and
the
u.k.
s
northern
ireland
the
key
sticking
point
in
the
dispute
an
open
border
underpins
both
the
local
economy
and
the
peace
process
that
ended
years
of
sectarian
violence
in
northern
ireland
chief
eu
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
said
monday
that
based
on
current
uk
thinking
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
we
can
arrive
at
a
legally
operative
solution
after
meeting
johnson
european
council
president
donald
tusk
tweeted
succinctly
no
breakthrough
no
breakdown
no
time
to
lose
brexit
the
u.k.
says
the
border
can
be
kept
free
of
customs
posts
and
other
obstacles
through
a
mix
of
as-yet
unproven
technology
and
an
all-ireland
zone
for
animals
and
agricultural
products
i
think
colleagues
around
the
table
in
brussels
can
see
how
we
might
do
that
johnson
said
all
it
will
take
is
a
political
will
to
get
there
johnson
is
also
facing
claims
that
during
his
tenure
as
mayor
of
london
between
and
he
gave
public
money
and
places
on
overseas
u.k.
trade
trips
to
a
close
friend
running
a
startup
business
he
denied
wrongdoing
saying
monday
that
everything
was
done
with
complete
propriety
completely
in
the
normal
way
the
british
government
is
also
bracing
for
a
supreme
court
ruling
on
whether
johnson
broke
the
law
when
he
suspended
parliament
for
five
weeks
ahead
of
the
oct
brexit
deadline
johnson
says
the
suspension
was
a
routine
measure
to
prepare
for
a
new
session
of
parliament
opponents
claim
he
acted
illegally
to
stop
lawmakers
from
interfering
with
his
plan
to
leave
the
eu
with
or
without
a
brexit
deal
the
justices
say
they
will
rule
tuesday
morning
a
ruling
that
the
suspension
was
illegal
would
be
a
huge
blow
to
johnson's
authority
and
could
see
lawmakers
recalled
to
parliament
immediately
