beto
o'rourke
says
women
should
be
able
to
choose
abortion
even
the
day
before
birth
no
limits
on
abortion
democratic
presidential
candidate
and
former
texas
congressman
beto
o'rourke
took
the
pro-abortion
stance
to
its
furthest
extreme
monday
when
questioned
on
the
issue
during
an
event
at
the
college
of
charleston
according
to
the
washington
examiner
o'rourke
who
has
avoided
specifics
on
abortion
policy
while
choosing
to
stick
to
more
general
talking
points
about
a
woman's
right
to
choose
was
forced
into
a
corner
by
a
very
pointed
question
from
an
event
attendee
my
question
is
this
i
was
born
sept
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
on
sept
my
life
had
no
value
the
man
asked
of
course
i
don't
think
that
o'rourke
replied
and
of
course
i'm
glad
that
you're
here
but
you
referenced
my
answer
in
ohio
and
it
remains
the
same
this
is
a
decision
that
neither
you
nor
i
nor
the
united
states
government
should
be
making
that's
a
decision
for
the
woman
to
make
beto
o'rourke
says
abortion
on
day
before
a
full-term
birth
is
a
decision
for
the
woman
to
make
youtu
be
o'rourke's
answer
contains
a
striking
set
of
seemingly
contradictory
conclusions
yes
an
unborn
life
has
value
and
at
the
same
time
yes
a
woman
should
be
able
to
choose
to
end
that
unborn
life
even
the
day
before
it
is
set
to
enter
the
world
even
more
notable
this
question
was
not
framed
in
the
context
of
the
mother's
health
or
the
unborn
child's
health
it
was
simply
a
question
of
the
value
of
a
life
and
o'rourke
in
his
answer
grants
women
unilateral
authority
to
get
an
abortion
at
any
point
before
birth
apparently
for
any
reason
o'rourke
has
previously
deferred
to
a
woman's
choice
regarding
late-term
abortion
in
march
during
an
ohio
town
hall
event
he
was
asked
if
he
supported
third-trimester
abortions
for
viable
fetuses
that
could
be
removed
by
c-section
that
should
be
a
decision
that
the
woman
makes
about
her
body
o'rourke
said
i
trust
her
