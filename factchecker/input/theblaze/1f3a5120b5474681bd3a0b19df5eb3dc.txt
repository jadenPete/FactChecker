nfl
star
curses
out
team
exec
calls
him
a
cracker
but
the
team
is
letting
him
play
monday
he
can
do
what
he
wants
apparently
oakland
raiders
wide
receiver
antonio
brown
verbally
abused
general
manager
mike
mayock
at
a
practice
wednesday
over
fines
the
team
imposed
on
him
but
he
will
still
play
in
monday's
game
with
no
repercussions
according
to
espn
brown
who
was
traded
from
the
steelers
to
the
raiders
this
offseason
has
been
in
an
extended
conflict
with
the
nfl
and
the
team
over
rules
that
prevented
him
from
wearing
his
preferred
helmet
the
receiver
was
so
upset
that
he
was
being
forced
to
wear
a
different
safer
helmet
this
season
that
he
threatened
to
retire
rather
than
wear
it
he
filed
multiple
grievances
with
the
league
losing
both
times
the
team
has
fined
him
for
missing
team
activities
while
considering
quitting
football
over
the
helmet
injustice
that's
not
to
mention
time
he
has
missed
because
he
suffered
severe
frostbite
on
his
feet
from
entering
a
cryotherapy
chamber
without
the
proper
footwear
brown
responded
to
a
letter
detailing
those
fines
by
posting
it
on
instagram
with
the
caption
when
your
own
team
want
to
hate
but
there's
no
stopping
me
now
devil
is
a
lie
everyone
got
to
pay
this
year
so
we
clear
still
in
the
nfl
talent
rules
over
all
else
so
despite
all
that
drama
the
team
is
ready
to
trot
brown
out
for
week
one's
monday
night
game
even
after
what
happened
wednesday
espn's
josina
anderson
reported
on
the
altercation
brown
has
since
issued
an
emotional
apology
receiving
forgiveness
and
acceptance
from
his
teammates
and
apparently
the
forgiveness
of
team
executives
since
brown
was
confirmed
by
head
coach
jon
gruden
to
be
playing
monday
despite
earlier
reports
that
the
team
intended
to
suspend
him
for
his
behavior
