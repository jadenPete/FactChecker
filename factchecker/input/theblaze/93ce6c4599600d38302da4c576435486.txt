san
francisco
city
government
unanimously
votes
to
label
the
nra
a
terrorist
organization
the
national
rifle
association
through
its
advocacy
has
armed
those
individuals
who
would
and
have
committed
acts
of
terrorism
are
you
a
national
rifle
association
member
if
so
the
city
of
san
francisco
now
officially
thinks
you're
part
of
a
terrorist
group
according
to
a
report
at
sfgate
the
san
francisco
board
of
supervisors
unanimously
passed
a
resolution
tuesday
night
declaring
the
nra
a
terrorist
organization
the
three-page
document
resolves
that
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
intends
to
declare
the
national
rifle
association
a
domestic
terrorist
organization
it
goes
on
to
accuse
the
group
of
arming
people
who
would
and
have
committed
acts
of
terrorism
while
spreading
propaganda
that
misinforms
and
aims
to
deceive
the
public
about
the
dangers
of
gun
violence
the
resolution
also
says
that
the
nra
musters
its
considerable
wealth
and
organizational
strength
to
promote
gun
ownership
and
incite
gun
owners
to
acts
of
violence
and
that
the
group's
leadership
promotes
extremist
positions
the
latter
is
the
only
part
of
the
document
that
makes
a
distinction
between
the
group's
membership
and
leadership
the
resolution
which
passed
unanimously
also
says
that
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
should
take
every
reasonable
step
to
limit
those
entities
who
do
business
with
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
from
doing
business
with
this
domestic
terrorist
organization
supervisor
catherine
stefani
who
authored
the
document
said
in
a
ktvu-tv
report
that
the
nra
has
it
coming
to
them
and
i
will
do
everything
that
i
possibly
can
to
call
them
out
on
what
they
are
which
is
a
domestic
terrorist
organization
she
also
wants
to
get
other
local
governments
to
pass
similar
resolutions
of
course
the
nra's
strength
lies
in
its
membership
while
the
group
is
often
portrayed
by
some
as
a
big-spending
gun
advocacy
bogeyman
the
numbers
simply
don't
support
that
characterization
when
viewed
in
context
the
actual
reason
for
the
group's
influence
lies
in
being
able
to
successfully
mobilize
people
who
just
care
about
their
fundamental
right
to
self-defense
the
new
york
times
admitted
as
much
in
while
the
nra
doesn't
release
its
exact
membership
numbers
the
association's
website
currently
boasts
more
than
five
million
members
though
media
reports
have
attempted
to
discredit
the
figure
yet
regardless
of
how
many
dues-paying
members
the
group
has
they're
all
now
formally
considered
terrorists
in
the
eyes
of
the
san
francisco
government
the
nra
fired
back
telling
the
ktvu
that
the
northern
california
city
has
bigger
problems
to
focus
on
this
ludicrous
stunt
by
the
board
of
supervisors
is
an
effort
to
distract
from
the
real
problems
facing
san
francisco
such
as
rampant
homelessness
drug
abuse
and
skyrocketing
petty
crime
to
name
a
few
the
gun
rights
group
said
in
a
statement
the
nra
will
continue
working
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
freedom-loving
americans
