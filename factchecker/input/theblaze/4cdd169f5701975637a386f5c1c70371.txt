appeals
court
orders
new
sentencing
for
man
convicted
of
brutally
assaulting
rand
paul
ruling
that
his
original
sentence
was
substantively
unreasonable
no
compelling
justification
a
federal
appeals
court
has
ordered
the
re-sentencing
of
rene
boucher
the
man
convicted
of
brutally
assaulting
sen
rand
paul
r-ky
in
an
unprovoked
attack
outside
paul's
kentucky
home
in
while
paul
was
mowing
his
lawn
boucher
who
lived
next
to
paul
attacked
the
senator
from
behind
breaking
six
of
paul's
ribs
and
severely
damaging
one
of
his
lungs
despite
the
nature
of
the
attack
and
the
fact
that
paul
is
a
sitting
member
of
congress
boucher
was
sentenced
in
june
to
just
days
in
prison
and
fined
he
could
have
faced
up
to
years
in
prison
though
prosecutors
recommended
to
months
because
boucher
pleaded
guilty
prosecutors
later
appealed
the
ruling
arguing
the
sentence
was
substantively
unreasonable
they
argued
that
boucher
a
retired
anesthesiologist
was
given
special
treatment
due
to
his
social
status
and
standing
in
the
community
on
monday
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
agreed
judge
jane
stranch
writing
for
the
three-judge
panel
said
there
was
no
compelling
justification
for
boucher's
well-below-guidelines
sentence
in
fact
she
said
the
district
court
judge
heavily
favored
boucher's
background
despite
the
nature
of
his
crime
and
the
extent
of
paul's
injuries
resulting
in
a
substantively
unreasonable
sentence
the
extreme
nature
of
the
district
judge's
deviation
from
sentencing
guidelines
was
made
without
a
correspondingly
compelling
justification
stranch
said
the
appeals
court
therefore
vacated
boucher's
lenient
sentence
and
remanded
his
case
to
district
court
for
re-sentencing
in
january
a
kentucky
jury
awarded
paul
nearly
for
the
injuries
he
suffered
he
sued
seeking
more
than
million
