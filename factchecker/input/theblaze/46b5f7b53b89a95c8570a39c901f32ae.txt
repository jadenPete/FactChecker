tactics
well-intentioned
efforts
to
make
schools
safer
through
preparedness
drills
for
active
shooter
situations
may
be
having
negative
psychological
effects
on
children
some
psychologists
and
educators
told
the
new
york
times
since
when
a
gunman
killed
children
and
six
school
staff
members
at
sandy
hook
elementary
in
newtown
connecticut
demand
for
active
shooter
drills
in
public
schools
increased
dramatically
the
department
of
education
began
recommending
run
hide
fight
responses
instead
of
the
previous
shelter-in-place
recommendations
and
the
new
method
required
more
training
for
educators
and
students
however
some
experts
are
concerned
that
the
drills
are
doing
more
harm
than
good
particularly
extremely
realistic
or
surprise
drills
that
might
do
more
to
make
students
feel
unsafe
than
they
do
to
protect
them
the
problem
is
exacerbated
when
the
drills
are
developed
by
people
who
may
be
experts
in
safety
and
security
but
who
lack
understanding
of
or
experience
with
children
a
whole
new
cottage
industry
has
emerged
where
people
who
don't
know
anything
about
kids
are
jumping
in
and
adapting
protocols
for
groups
like
police
officers
or
people
preparing
for
combat

as

a

from
the

middle
school
students
were
subjected
to
an
unannounced
active
shooter
drill
with
fire
alarms
and
unseen
people
jiggling

some
students
thought
there
was
an
actual
attack
and
texted
what
they
thought
were
their
final
goodbyes
to
family
members
despite
the
fact
that
an
extremely
small
percentage
of
gun-related
homicides
take
place
at
schools
a
pew
research
center
poll
from
found
that
percent
of
teenagers
and
an
equal
percentage
of
parents
are
very
or
somewhat
worried
about
a
mass
shooting
at
school

active

drills
are

that
terrifying

not
the
