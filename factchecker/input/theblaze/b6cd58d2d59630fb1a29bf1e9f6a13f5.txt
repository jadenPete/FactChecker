she
later
defended
her
words
connecting
her
animus
for

desire
that

the
actor
who
frequently
stars
alongside
his

the
hatred

with
potential
landfall
still
two
days
away
it's
not
yet
clear
if
dorian
will
strike
florida
as
of
saturday
afternoon
the
storm
was
just
shy
of
a
category
indicating
it
continues
to
strengthen
but
the
forecast
track
is
less
clear
some
forecasters
believe
the
storm
could
recurve
north
making
landfall
somewhere
in
the
carolinas
while
others
think
the
storm
could
miss
land
completely
