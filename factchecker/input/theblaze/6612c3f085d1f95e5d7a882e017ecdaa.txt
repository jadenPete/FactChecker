talks
about
conflating
the
stories
of
three
different

into
an
anecdote
in
an
interview
with
npr
former
vice
president
joe
biden
assured
npr
that
messing
up
details
in
campaign
anecdotes
was
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
what
gaffes
biden
is
infamous
for
sometimes
making
gaffes
during
speeches
a
few
examples
include
these
gaffes
can
sometimes
lead
to
questions
over
what
biden
means
by
policy
proposals
like
on
monday
when
he
called
for
an
end
to
gun
magazines
that
hold
multiple
bullets
in
them
presumably
he
was
referring
to
high-capacity
magazines
a
frequent
target
of
gun
control
advocates
but
the
phrasing
led
to
questions
about
whether
he
was
suggesting
more
sweeping
gun
control
measures
than
his
democratic
primary
opponents
what
did
he
say
now
during
an
interview
that
covered
everything
from
tariffs
to
his
actions
during
the
days
leading
up
to
the
iraq
war
npr
host
asma
khalid
asked
biden
about
his
gaffes
and
if
he
felt
that
the
details
and
not
just
the
intentions
matter
when
you're
making
decisions
as
president
well
they're
two
fundamentally
different
questions
you're
asking
me
biden
said
he
then
referred
to
a
recent
instance
in
which
he
had
been
called
out
for
conflating
the
stories
of
three
different
soldiers
into
an
anecdote
on
the
campaign
trail
he
said
that
the
whole
purpose
of
what
he
had
been
saying
did
not
in
any
way
affect
my
point
biden
argued
that
he
had
been
making
a
larger
point
about
the
bravery
and
decency
of
the
men
and
women
in
the
military
i
was
making
a
point
about
a
generation
biden
said
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
judgment
of
whether
or
not
you
send
troops
to
war
the
judgment
of
whether
you
bring
someone
home
the
judgment
of
whether
or
not
you
decide
on
a
health
care
policy
khalid
pressed
him
again
on
whether
he
thought
that
the
details
mattered
no
but
the
details
are
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
he
repeated
if
in
fact
i
forget
that
it
was
general
rodriguez
out
of
all
the
times
i've
been
in
and
out
of
afghanistan
and
iraq
and
bosnia
and
kosovo
as
much
as
anybody
except
maybe
my
deceased
friend
john
mccain
and
maybe
lindsey
graham
and
so
the
fact
that
i
would
forget
that
it
was
rodriguez
who
was
pinning
i
believe
this
was
the
case
pinning
a
bronze
star
on
a
young
man
was
it's
irrelevant
to
the
point
he
continued
it's
like
saying
i
had
this
very
bright
reporter
and
i
think
her
eyes
were
blue
what
difference
does
it
make
about
whether
you're
a
bright
reporter
your
eyes
are
brown
it's
irrelevant
and
you
know
it
