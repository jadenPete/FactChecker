maher
blasts
the
far
left
as
a
cancer
on
progressivism
hbo
host
bill
maher
appeared
on
thursday's
morning
joe
where
he
blasted
people
in
the
far
left
as
a
cancer
on
progressivism
maher
has
made
the
cancer
remark
at
least
every
three
months
since
march
what
are
the
details
speaking
with
msnbc's
joe
scarborough
maher
said
that
the
democratic
party
is
moving
too
far
left
and
insisted
that
the
presidential
election
could
go
to
president
donald
trump
once
more
according
to
newsbusters
scarborough
said
i
sat
through
the
last
debate
screaming
at
the
television
set
as
one
democratic
candidate
after
another
suggested
that
former
president
barack
obama
was
too
conservative
on
health
care
and
immigration
how
maddening
is
that
to
you
that
they're
having
this
race
to
the
far
left
the
host
asked
maher
didn't
mince
words
with
his
response
it's
not
good
he
warned
it's
kind
of
a
cancer
on
progressivism
he
continued
by
pointing
out
that
democrats
rely
too
heavily
on
social
media
platforms
such
as
twitter
to
spread
their
messages
and
gauge
the
temperature
of
their
audience
i
have
been
saying
this
for
years
that
first
of
all
you
have
to
stand
up
to
twitter
the
real
time
host
insisted
twitter
isn't
us
twitter
isn't
the
rank
and
file
democrat
it's
not
even
most
liberals
but
they
don't
do
it
maher
pointed
out
that
democrats
are
sabotaging
themselves
in
the
long
run
by
identifying
with
far-left
policies
i
think
the
only
way
the
democrat
loses
is
to
convince
a
lot
of
people
that
they
are
actually
scarier
or
crazier
than
trump
which
is
not
easy
to
do
but
i
think
they
can
he
reasoned
what
else
the
outspoken
host
also
added
that
political
correctness
is
rampant
in
the
u.s.
and
many
voters
are
predisposed
to
appreciate
trump
because
he
is
not
politically
correct
i
think
we
underestimate
how
much
america
has
been
choking
on
political
correctness
for
years
maher
pointed
out
maher
who
said
that
he
likes
presidential
candidate
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
is
still
frightened
by
the
prospects
of
what
the
democrats
could
do
in
the
election
i
love
elizabeth
warren
but
she
does
scare
me
a
little
bit
because
again
all
we
have
to
do
to
win
this
election
is
not
be
scarier
to
people
than
donald
trump
he
said
