sen
rand
paul
r-ky
went
for
the
jugular
after
john
bolton
was
unceremoniously
fired
tuesday
as
the
national
national
security
advisor
of
president
donald
trump
i
think
if
you're
gonna
work
for
the
president
you
need
to
work
for
the
president
he
explained
helpfully
to
neil
cavuto
on
fox
news
you
need
to
try
to
further
the
president's
agenda
my
opinion
is
that
i
saw
john
bolton
working
against
the
president's
agenda
he
had
his
own
agenda
paul
added
and
when
the
president
was
trying
to
negotiate
a
deal
with
north
korea
you
got
bolton
out
there
saying
we
should
try
the
libyan
solution
which
means
we
should
execute
their
leader
he
said
paul
was
referring
to
a
comment
bolton
made
in
that
appeared
to
derail
negotiations
after
north
koreans
angrily
responded
that's
not
very
helpful
to
any
negotiated
settlement
with
north
korea
or
any
country
paul
said
he
also
accused
bolton
of
being
naive
and
advocating
for
endless
wars
in
order
to
establish
perfect
societies
in
regions
of
the
world
where
paul
seemed
to
think
the
american
principles
of
governance
were
ill-fitted
bolton
denied
the
official
white
house
account
of
events
and
said
that
he
had
offered
his
resignation
to
the
president
on
monday
night
but
that
he
replied
that
they
would
talk
about
it
later
on
tuesday
the
president
tweeted
that
he
had
fired
bolton
which
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
paul
has
been
a
vocal
and
passionate
critic
of
foreign
policy
hawks
like
bolton
as
opposed
to
policies
that
critics
call
akin
to
isolationism
here's
the
video
of
paul's
comments
