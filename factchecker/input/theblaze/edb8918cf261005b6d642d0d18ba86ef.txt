justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
shuts
down
talk
on
eliminating
electoral
college
more
theoretical
than
real
since
president
donald
trump's
victory
democrats
have
increased
calls
to
eliminate
the
constitutionally
mandated
electoral
college
msnbc
host
chris
hayes
for
example
argued
on
his
show
last
month
the
electoral
college
is
undemocratic
and
potentially
perpetuates
systemic
racism
the
weirdest
thing
about
the
electoral
college
is
the
fact
that
if
it
wasn't
specifically
in
the
constitution
for
the
presidency
it
would
be
unconstitutional
hayes
said
but
according
to
supreme
court
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
electoral
college
is
here
to
stay
speaking
at
the
university
of
chicago
on
monday
ginsburg
the
eldest
supreme
court
judge
said
constitutional
changes
like
abolishing
the
electoral
college
are
more
theoretical
than
real
the
chicago
tribune
reported
it's
largely
a
dream
because
our
constitution
is
hard
to
amend
she
said
i
know
that
from
experience
though
amending
the
constitution
is
an
intentionally
difficult
process
ginsburg
has
previously
voiced
support
for
eliminating
the
electoral
college
there
are
some
things
i
would
like
to
change
one
is
the
electoral
college
she
said
in
but
that
would
require
a
constitutional
amendment
and
amending
our
constitution
is
powerfully
hard
to
do
many
democrats
believe
that
america
should
elect
presidents
in
a
directly
democratic
fashion
despite
america
being
established
as
a
constitutional
republic
to
prevent
a
presidential
candidate
who
earns
the
majority
of
votes
from
losing
an
election
however
the
founding
fathers
established
the
electoral
college
to
provide
states
with
somewhat
equal
representation
although
larger
states
still
maintain
a
considerable
power
advantage
over
smaller
states
for
example
california
the
most
populous
state
has
electoral
votes
whereas
montana
has
just
three
if
the
electoral
college
did
not
exist
then
america's
urban
centers
which
heavily
lean
to
the
left
would
likely
decide
the
presidency
while
smaller
more
rural
states
would
have
less
influence
on
who
becomes
president
