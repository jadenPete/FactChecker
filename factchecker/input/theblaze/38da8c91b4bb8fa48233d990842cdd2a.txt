reported
the
appointment
of
former

the
possibility
that
new
charges
could
be
brought

former

has
never
backed
off
his
claim

for
filing
a
false
police

the

state's
attorney's

said
stemming
from
his
claim
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
racist
homophobic
attack
by
masked
men
who
yelled
maga
country
a
reference
to
president
donald
trump's

and
put
a
noose
around

paid

a
grand

in
early
march
indicted
smollett
with
counts
of
disorderly
conduct
in
connection
with
the
staged-attack
allegations
but
a
few
weeks
later
all
the
charges
against
smollett
were
dropped
after
reviewing
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
including
mr
smollett's
volunteer
service
in
the
community
and
agreement
to
forfeit
his
bond
to
the
city
of
chicago
we
believe
this
outcome
is
a
just
disposition
and
appropriate
resolution
to
this
case
the
cook
county
state's
attorney's
office
stated
in
an
email
wbbm
reported
smollett's
community
service
reportedly
included
volunteering
with
jesse
jackson
sr
s
rainbow
push
coalition
for
several
hours
over
the
course
of
two
days
then-chicago
mayor
rahm
emanuel
angrily
blasted
the
dropped
charges
against
smollett
and
called
it
not
on
the
level
associations
from
every
police
department
in
cook
county
announced
no
confidence
in
cook
county
state's
attorney
kim
foxx
in
addition
the
illinois
prosecutors
bar
association
accused
foxx
of
making
repeated
misleading
and
deceptive
statements
to
the
public
and
having
failed
in
her
most
fundamental
ethical
obligations
to
the
public
photo
by
scott
olson

it
was
widely
reported
that
foxx
recused
herself
from
the
smollett
case
after
rumblings
that
she
interfered
in
the
investigation
but
then
it
came
to
light
that
she
never
actually
recused
herself
at
all
foxx
also
wondered
whether
racism
and
sexism
was
behind
criticism
against
her
as
someone
who
has
lived
in
this
city
who
came
up
in
the
projects
of
this
city
to
serve
as
the
first
african
american
woman
in
this
role
it
is
disheartening
to
me
that
when
we
get
in
these
positions
somehow
the
goalposts
change
finally
in
june
toomin
ordered
the
appointment
of
a
special
prosecutor
saying
the
unprecedented
irregularities
identified
in
this
case
warrants
the
appointment
of
independent
counsel
to
restore
the
public's
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
our
criminal
justice
system
