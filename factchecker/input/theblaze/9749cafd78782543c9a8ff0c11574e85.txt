comedy
if
there's

thing
the
left
most
decidedly
is
not
it's

but
they
sure
seem
to
know
what
fits
the
definition
of
funny
these
days
and
they
definitely
don't
mind
telling
us
what
we're
allowed
to
laugh
about
and
what
we'd
better
not
chuckle
at
in
fact
for
some
comedic
utterances
they'd
be
happier
with
a
frown

better

a

or

a
recent
case-in-point
is
comedian
dave
chappelle's
sticks
and
stones
special
which
theblaze's
lauren
chen
said
received
rave
reviews
from
percent
of
the
audience
the
exception
being
those
left-wing
journalists
who
pushed
the
outrage
culture
narrative
one
chappelle
riff
they
probably
aren't
giggling
about
in
planned
parenthood
cafeterias
if
men
shouldn't
tell
women
to
not
have
abortions
it's
only
fair
that
men
shouldn't
have
to
pony
up
dough
to
take
care
of
children
either

poking
the
paper
tiger
now
fellow
comic
bill
burr
is
coming
under
scrutiny
with
his
new
special
paper
tiger
and
as
with
their
reaction
to
chappelle's
latest
work
left-wing
critics
are
quick
to
judge
what's
politically
correct
about
burr's
comedy
too
and
in
the
process
once
again
they
end
up
telling
the
rest
of
us
what
we're
allowed
to
say
and
believe
take
kathryn
vanarendonk's
review
in
vulture
which
reads
more
like
a
cautionary
tale
of
what's
socially
acceptable
these
days
than
comedy
criticism
her
main
problem
with
paper
tiger
is
the
opening
minutes
during
which
burr
flips
quickly
through
complaints
about
the
overanalysis
of
jokes
how
white
women
are
to
blame
for
the
current
lamentable
state
of
culture
in
the
united
states
and
jokes
about
disabled
characters
being
played
by
able-bodied
actors
but
you
can
tell
vanarendonk
has
a
really
big
problem
with
burr's
next
target
michelle
obama
calling
burr's
bit
about
the
former
first
lady
his
biggest
and
most
convincingly
risky
swing
she
says
that
burr
in
full
character
as
angriest
man
in
the
world
dares
you
to
turn
the
special
off
in
disgust
vanarendonk
also
characterizes
the
opening
of
burr's
special
as
furious
resentful
troll
comedy
that
plays
like
a
toddler
yelling
the
only
swear
word
they
know
desperately
begging
for
someone
to
punish
them
she
also
observes
burr's
sexist
throat-clearing
and
that
at
one
point
he
uses
a
stupid
voice
and
mocks
male
feminists
and
makes
fun
of
the
idea
that
culture
can
be
appropriated
it's
all
tsk
tsk
tsk
until
she
says
burr
shifts
gears
and
more
or
less
redeems
himself
noting
his
riff
about
a
woman
touching
him
inappropriately
before
a
show
vanarendonk
gushes
over
burr's
underlying
message
that
sexual
assault
has
nothing
to
do
with
sex
and
everything
to
do
with
power
it's
so
far
from
his
opening
lines
about
how
metoo
has
robbed
men
of
due
process
that
it
feels
like
the
message
could've
come
straight
off
an
anti-trump
protest
poster
from
this
point
she
lauds
burr's
thoughtful
surprising
introspective
comedy
while
dropping
in
phrases
such
as
clueless
white
troll
and
maga
provocateur
indeed
vanarendonk
while
explaining
what's
funny
and
not
funny
about
burr's
comedy
appears
to
show
us
the
way
when
it
comes
to
what's
politically
correct
and
socially
acceptable
at
least
to
those
on
the
left
