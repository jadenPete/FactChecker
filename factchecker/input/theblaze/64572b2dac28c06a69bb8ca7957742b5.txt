new
study
finds
vegetarianism
and
veganism
could
lead
to
higher
risk
of
stroke
meat
eaters
however
still
have
a
higher
risk
of
heart
disease
if
you
were
considering
swearing
off
meat
for
health
reasons
maybe
don't
throw
away
that
bacon
cheeseburger
just
yet
at
least
not
if
all
that
you're
trying
to
prevent
is
a
stroke
a
report
by
researchers
at
oxford
published
in
the
british
medical
journal
found
that
out
of
nearly
people
studied
vegetarians
and
vegans
had
a
percent
higher
rate
of
stroke
than
meat
eaters
who
conducted
this
study
this
peer-reviewed
study
was
written
by
a
team
led
by
tammy
tong
a
nutritional
epidemiologist
at
the
university
of
oxford
what
did
the
study
say
the
study
looked
at
people
percent
of
whom
ate
meat
percent
were
pescatarians
and
the
remaining
percent
were
vegetarian
or
vegan
percentages
are
rounded
while
the
study
found
that
pescatarians
and
vegetarians
both
had
a
lower
risk
of
ischaemic
heart
disease
percent
for
pescatarians
and
percent
for
vegetarians
however
vegetarians
had
higher
rates
of
total
stroke
than
meat
eaters
equivalent
to
three
more
cases
of
total
stroke
per
population
over
years
mostly
due
to
a
higher
rate
of
haemorrhagic
stroke
comparatively
vegetarians
had
fewer
cases
of
heart
disease
for
the
same
group
size
and
time
period
tong
told
cnn
that
while
it
wasn't
clear
what
caused
this
increase
in
stroke
risk
it
could
be
caused
by
very
low
cholesterol
levels
or
very
low
levels
of
some
nutrients
while
still
having
a
lower
risk
of
heart
disease
than
meat
eaters
pescatarians
did
not
have
the
increased
risk
of
stroke
that
vegetarians
exhibited
she
also
stressed
to
time
magazine
that
there
still
seemed
to
be
benefits
to
vegetarianism
since
t
he
lower
risk
of
heart
disease
does
seem
to
outweigh
the
higher
risk
of
stroke
