and

nominee
hillary
clinton
made
a
visit
to
an
art
exhibition
in
venice
italy
on
tuesday
and
spent
an
hour
perusing
hard
copies
of
her
own
emails
on
display
while
sitting
at
a
replica
of
the
oval
office's
resolute
desk
what
are
the
details
artist
kenneth
goldsmith
boasted
on
twitter
that
clinton
dropped
by
to
see
his
exhibition
titled
hillary
the
hillary
clinton
emails
which
included
all
pages
of
the
controversial
documents
according
to
goldsmith
clinton
stated
this
exhibition
is
further
proof
that
nothing
wrong
or
controversial
can
be
found
on
these
emails
it
makes
them
accessible
to
everyone
and
allows
everyone
to
read
them
she
added
they
are
just
so
boring
curator
francesco
urbano
ragazzi
told
the
huffpost
he
was
given
a
heads
up
that
clinton
might
drop
by
but
organizers
didn't
take
it
seriously
at
first
someone
close
to
mrs
clinton
contacted
us
very
informally
a
few
days
before
her
visit
urbano
ragazzi
told
the
outlet
we
realized
that
it
wasn't
a
joke
only
when
we
saw
the
security
service
inside
the
exhibition
space
at
a
m
on
tuesday
in
a
statement
to
the
hill
urbano
ragazzi
gave
some
insight
into
the
meaning
behind
the
artwork
explaining
that
in
the
digital
age
making
these
documents
available
to
everyone
in
a
touchable
format
is
a
way
to
focus
on
something
concrete
in
order
to
exit
the
impalpable
toxicity
of
ideological
narratives
the
exhibition
is
a
way
to
allude
to
an
alternative
world
that
will
never
exist
we
are
happy
that
the
real
hillary
clinton
has
been
part
of
this
image
full
of
possibilities
the
curatorial
team
continued
visiting
hillary
by
kenneth
goldsmith
she
has
not
only
been
in
front
of
her
emails
the
exhibition
is
indeed
the
portrait
of
a
powerful
woman
but
also
the
portrait
of
a
historical
change
in
our
understanding
of
notions
such
as
transparency
propaganda
public
and
private
space
anything
else
during
an
interview
outside
the
venue
with
italian
news
outlet
tgr
veneto
according
to
cnn
clinton
reiterated
her
view
that
the
controversy
surrounding
her
use
of
a
private
email
server
to
send
classified
government
information
was
blown
out
of
proportion
it
was
and
is
still
one
of
the
strangest
most
absurd
events
in
american
political
history
the
former
secretary
of
state
reportedly
told
tgr
veneto
and
anyone
can
go
in
and
look
at
them
there's
nothing
there
it's
an
artistic
way
of
making
the
same
point
that
i
made
in
the
book
i
wrote
what
happened
clinton
continued
and
that
is
there
was
nothing
wrong
there
was
nothing
that
should
have
been
so
controversial
