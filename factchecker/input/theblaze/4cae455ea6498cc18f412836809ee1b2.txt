teammate
defends
drew

from
vicious
criticism
over
christian
bible
video
he
won't
stand
for
lgbtq
lobby
backlash
benjamin
watson
former
new
orleans
saints
tight
end
spoke
out
in
defense
of
saints
quarterback
drew
brees
who
was
featured
in
a
recent
pro-christianity
pro-bible
video
produced
by
focus
on
the
family
the
lgbtq
lobby
attacked
brees
over
his
participation
in
the
viral
video
what
did
watson
say
watson
an
outspoken
christian
appeared
on
fox
friends
to
defend
the
faith
of
his
former
teammate
as
well
as
his
actions
my
reaction
was
first
the
article
itself
was
misleading
and
a
mischaracterization
of
focus
on
the
family
and
of
drew
watson
said
they
were
slanderous
and
so
my
response
was
to
stop
lying
with
those
sorts
of
labels
he
added
the
criticisms
of
those
against
the
video
and
brees
participation
in
the
project
were
especially
offensive
because
of
the
very
idea
of
how
critics
characterized
the
christian
group
it's
a
shame
in
this
country
right
now
if
you
adhere
to
certain
biblical
beliefs
that
we
all
have
a
right
to
choose
what
religion
we
adhere
to
you're
labeled
as
anti
he
said
what
focus
on
the
family
does
is
upholds
marriage
which
family
is
the
basic
building
block
of
society
he
continued
the
group
upholds
those
things
and
they're
labeled
anti
by
other
people
and
there's
an
agenda
there
and
that's
what
really
upset
me
about
the
whole
thing
what
was
in
the
video
anyway
the
video
a
promotion
advocating
for
christian
children
to
bring
their
bibles
to
school
featured
brees
a
practicing
christian
encouraging
children
to
live
out
their
faith
in
a
big
way
i
want
to
encourage
you
to
live
out
your
faith
on
bring
your
bible
to
school
day
and
share
god's
love
with
friends
brees
says
in
the
video
you're
not
alone
brees
responded
to
criticisms
after
the
video
went
viral
in
a
statement
the
new
orleans
saints
quarterback
said
what
i
did
was
i
filmed
a
video
recently
that
was
encouraging
to
kids
to
bring
their
bibles
to
school
for
national
bring
your
bible
to
school
day
so
i'm
not
sure
why
the
negativity
spread
or
why
people
tried
to
rope
me
into
certain
negativity
i
do
not
support
any
groups
that
discriminate
or
that
have
their
own
agendas
that
are
trying
to
promote
inequality
ok
he
added
so
hopefully
that
has
set
the
record
straight
and
we
can
all
move
on
because
that
is
not
what
i
stand
for
you
can
watch
the
original
focus
on
the
family
video
