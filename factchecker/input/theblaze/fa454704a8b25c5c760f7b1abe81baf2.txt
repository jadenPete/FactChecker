in

tweet
thursday
morning
congressional
progressive
caucus
co-chair
and
house
judiciary
committee
member
pramila
jayapal
d-wash
praised
a
recent
statement
from
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
accusing
the
president
of
violating
the
emoluments
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution
she
also
said
that
the
judiciary
committee
is
engaged
in
impeachment
investigation
to
get
facts
on
violations
of
emoluments
clause
pelosi's
statement
wednesday
alleges
that
president
trump
is
violating
the
constitution
by
making
money
off
of
his
lavish
ritzy
resort
properties
ultimately
prioritizing
his
profits
over
the
interests
of
the
american
people
it
later
goes
on
to
directly
accuse
trump
of
violating
the
emoluments
clause
by
accepting
and
encouraging
foreign
governments
to
pay
to
stay
at
trump
resort
properties
without
congressional
approval
the
statement
was
issued
in
response
to
a
recent
suggestion
from
president
trump
that
the
g-
hold
its
meeting
at
his
doral
golf
resort
near
miami
and
a
media
dust-up
over
vice
president
mike
pence's
recent
stay
at
trump's
doonbeg
resort
in
ireland
in
response
to
those
reports
and
others
described
in
the
statement
pelosi
called
trump's
properties
a
cesspool
of
corruption
behind
allegations
of
collusion
with
the
russian
government
during
the
election
and
allegations
of
obstruction
of
justice
during
the
investigation
of
those
collusion
allegations
the
emoluments
clause
is
a
less
discussed
potential
instrument
in
democrats
impeachment
toolbox
in
short
the
constitution
says
that
federal
officeholders
can't
without
the
consent
of
the
congress
accept
of
any
present
emolument
office
or
title
of
any
kind
whatever
from
any
king
prince
or
foreign
state
another
section
says
that
the
president
can't
take
any
other
emolument
from
the
united
states
or
any
of
them
in
addition
to
his
federal
salary
during
his
time
in
office
trump's
critics
have
taken
this
to
mean
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
his
businesses
which
are
currently
being
run
by
his
sons
to
accept
payments
from
foreign
or
domestic
government
officials
others
however
argue
that
the
founders
intent
wasn't
to
target
presidents
still-operating
businesses
after
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
stumbling
unimpressive
congressional
testimony
failed
to
build
the
kind
of
impeachment
momentum
that
trump's
opponents
hoped
for
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
listed
possible
emoluments
clause
violations
as
something
the
panel
would
be
looking
into
efforts
to
use
the
emoluments
clause
against
president
trump
go
back
as
far
as
when
the
governments
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
maryland
sued
the
president
for
flagrantly
violating
it
a
federal
judge
determined
in
july
that
the
case
lacked
standing
days
later
a
federal
judge
temporarily
blocked
congressional
democrats
subpoenas
in
a
different
emoluments
clause
case
