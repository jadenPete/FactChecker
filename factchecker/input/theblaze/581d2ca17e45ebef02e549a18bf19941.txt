wapo
publishes
bizarre
op-ed
smearing
pro-lifers
as
racist
and
gets
slapped
down
for
it
lying
about
people
and
saying
they're
racist
only
makes
you
look
crazier
the
washington
post
faced
online
backlash
after
they
published
an
insinuation
of
racism
against
writer
j.d.
vance
in
a
pro-abortion
opinion
article
the
article
by
marissa
brostoff
attempts
to
link
white
supremacy
to
the
pro-life
movement
but
among
the
tenuous
associations
is
a
quote
from
vance
when
he
spoke
at
a
conference
critics
loudly
lambasted
the
unsubstantiated
and
misleading
insinuation
that
vance
was
speaking
about
whites
this
piece
claims
vance
opposes
abortion
because
he
wants
america
to
be
more
white
said
ben
domenech
of
the
federalist
we
get
it
hiattf
ruthmarcus
all
wapo's
contributors
think
abortion
is
great
lying
about
people
who
hate
it
and
saying
they're
racist
only
makes
you
look
crazier
he
added
as
documented
by
ramesh
ponnuru
in
the
national
review
the
section
before
the
quoted
excerpt
made
it
clear
vance
was
speaking
about
the
birth
rate
of
the
entire
country
not
just
whites
ponnuru
criticized
the
rest
of
the
op-ed
as
stupid
and
argued
that
the
attempted
association
of
white
nationalism
with
the
pro-life
cause
was
all
propagandistic
ross
douthat
of
the
new
york
times
also
noted
that
vance
had
encouraged
support
of
african-american
single
mothers
in
the
same
speech
that
brostoff
was
mischaracterizing
as
aligned
with
white
nationalism
eventually
the
post
issued
a
correction
brostoff
complained
about
vance
stans
slang
for
fans
on
her
twitter
account
and
equated
concern
for
american
birth
rates
with
white
nationalism
she
tweeted
welp
the
jd
vance
stans
freaked
out
the
wash
post
bad
enough
that
they
pulled
a
line
suggesting
he
was
worried
about
declining
white
birthrates
confirmed
that
he
was
rlly
talking
about
declining
american
birthrates
a
very
not-white-nationalist
thing
to
be
worried
about
