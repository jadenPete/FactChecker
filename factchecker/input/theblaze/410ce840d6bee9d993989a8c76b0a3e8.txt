she
has
some
pretty
serious
offers
from
nfl
teams
to
kick
for
them
during
a
preseason
game
according
to
nfl
com
the
buzz
around
lloyd's
potential
as
an
nfl
kicker
began
when
a
video
of
her
kicking
a
field
goal
at
a
joint
practice
between
the
baltimore
ravens
and
philadelphia
eagles
went
viral

lloyd
said
she
could've
joined
a
team
for
a
preseason
game
this
thursday
to
make
her
nfl
debut
but
she
and
the
women's
national
team
are
already
scheduled
for
a
match
against
portugal
pretty
serious
lloyd
said
of
the
nature
of
the
offers
like
i
said
i
have
a
game
this
thursday
which
i
happen
to
be
playing
in
philadelphia
it's
not
something
i
would've
passed
up
first
and
foremost
i
am
a
soccer
player
but
it's
been
crazy
a
casual
day
me
just
having
some
fun
being
competitive
and
kicking
field
goals
went
to
being
the
most
talked-about
news
around
the
globe
it's
just
crazy
how
all
of
that
works
at
least
one
nfl
player
has
his
doubts
about
her
ability
to
put
the
pads
on
and
kick
in
a
game
sound
sweet
til
somebody
block
the
kick
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
on
defense
san
diego
chargers
receiver
keenan
allen
wrote
would
be
like
the
stampede
scene
in
the
lion
king
movie
she
do
got
a
boot
though
lloyd
understands
the
physical
obstacles
that
go
beyond
just
kicking
the
ball
but
she
hasn't
totally
given
up
on
the
idea
i've
had
other
girls
that
have
played
for
their
youth
teams
or
high
school
teams
as
a
kicker
and
i've
gotten
messages
that
i've
given
them
the
confidence
to
go
for
it
even
more
lloyd
said
that's
the
kind
of
message
you
want
to
hear
i
think
somebody's
got
to
be
the
first
one
right
