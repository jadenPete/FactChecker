sheriff
blames
california's
sanctuary
city
policies
for
illegal
alien's
crime
spree
here's
why
we're
gonna
continue
to
have
more
of
this
situation
happen
the
arrest
of
an
illegal
alien
could
have
been
accomplished
with
far
less
threat
to
the
public
had
it
not
been
for
california's
sanctuary
city
policies
says
a
local
sheriff
this
person
is
not
a
legal
citizen
within
the
united
states
said
merced
sheriff
van
warnke
we
had
him
in
our
custody
in
january
of
this
year
he
continued
and
because
of
the
folks
in
sacramento
limiting
our
ability
to
cooperate
with
ice
we
could
not
turn
him
over
year-old
guadalupe
lopez-herrera
shot
a
sheriff's
deputy
on
wednesday
and
fled
the
scene
police
later
caught
up
with
him
after
a
high
speed
car
chase
on
thursday
he
sped
away
at
speeds
reaching
mph
and
fired
more
shots
at
the
police
before
being
foiled
by
a
spike
strip
van
warnke
indicated
that
lopez-herrera
will
be
charged
with
attempted
murder
of
the
sheriff's
deputy
among
other
charges
california
is
among
the
worst
states
when
it
comes
to
sanctuary
city
policies
that
aim
to
hamstring
federal
efforts
to
enforce
immigration
laws
by
forbidding
cooperation
from
local
law
enforcement
agencies
bottom
line
is
our
immigration
policies
need
to
be
revamped
because
we're
gonna
continue
to
have
more
of
this
situation
happen
said
van
warnke
we
knew
ahead
of
time
this
guy's
potential
for
violence
was
there
he
added
here's
the
media
briefing
with
sheriff
warnke
