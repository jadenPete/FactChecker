jussie
smollett's
legal
team
says
they
have
evidence
that
their
client
was
attacked
in
a
january
hate
crime
the
team
however
doesn't
say
what
that
evidence
is
the
city
of
chicago
is
seeking
in
a
civil
lawsuit
from
smollett
to
cover
costs
of
investigating
what
the
city
refers
to
as
a
staged
attack
he
insists
that
because
the
attack
was
legitimate
he
doesn't
owe
the
city
anything
smollett
reported
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
hate
crime
in
january
when
police
arrived
at
his
apartment
to
question
him
the
actor
had
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
said
that
he
had
been
physically
attacked
on
a
city
street
what
are
the
new
details
the
actor's
legal
team
requested
the
court
to
toss
out
the
city's
lawsuit
but
the
city
refused
pointing
to
what
they
say
is
evidence
that
smollett
lied
about
the
attack
the
city
points
to
gps
text
message
bank
records
and
video
evidence
to
support
the
idea
that
the
actor
staged
the
attack
on
himself
according
to
kcbs-tv
on
wednesday
smollett's
legal
team
insisted
that
every
iota
of
the
alleged
attack
is
supported
by
police
evidence
the
city
maintains
that
smollett
paid
two
brothers
to
carry
out
the
staged
attack
the
brothers
attorneys
previously
admitted
that
their
clients
participated
in
the
hoax
and
did
so
only
because
smollett
paid
them
authorities
arrested
smollett
in
february
and
charged
him
with
felony
disorderly
conduct
in
connection
with
the
alleged
attack
police
previously
insisted
that
smollett
set
up
the
staged
attack
because
he
was
dissatisfied
with
his
salary
on
fox
show
empire
in
march
a
grand
jury
indicted
smollett
on
counts
of
disorderly
conduct
in
connection
with
the
allegations
why
were
the
charges
dropped
weeks
later
cook
county
state's
attorney
kim
foxx's
office
abruptly
dropped
the
charges
against
smollett
in
a
statement
foxx
said
after
reviewing
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
including
mr
smollett's
volunteer
service
in
the
community
and
agreement
to
forfeit
his
bond
to
the
city
of
chicago
we
believe
this
outcome
is
a
just
disposition
and
appropriate
resolution
to
this
case
the
actor's
community
service
duties
reportedly
consisted
of
volunteering
with
jesse
jackson
sr
s
rainbow
push
coalition
for
several
hours
over
a
period
of
two
days
foxx
later
claimed
to
have
recused
herself
from
the
investigation
after
much
outcry
and
criticism
about
her
handling
of
the
case
but
it
turned
out
that
she
never
did
recuse
herself
former
u.s.
attorney
dan
webb
has
been
appointed
as
a
special
prosecutor
to
more
closely
examine
the
case
and
the
conduct
of
foxx's
office
