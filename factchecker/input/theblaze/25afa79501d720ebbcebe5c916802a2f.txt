he
continued
knife
crime
has
continually
plagued
london
a
city
whose
police
officers
do
not
carry
firearms
over
the
last
decade
and
the
problem
is
only
getting
worse

london
mayor
khan
has
enacted
knife
control
policies
that
have
proved
ineffective
earlier
this
summer
khan
blamed
the
violence
epidemic
on
austerity
the
sad
reality
is
the
violence
we're
seeing
on
our
streets
today

an
appalling
side
effect
of
increasing
inequality
and
alienation
caused
by
years
of
austerity
and
neglect
