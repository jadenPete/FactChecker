ceos
of
major
us
companies
send
letter
to
senators
asking
for
gun
control
legislation
firms
represented
include
dick's
sporting
goods
levi
strauss
co
and
pinterest
the
leaders
of
major
american
companies
have
signed
off
on
a
letter
sent
to
every
u.s.
senator
urging
members
of
the
upper
chamber
to
pass
a
bill
to
require
background
checks
on
all
gun
sales
and
a
strong
red
flag
law
what
are
the
details
the
letter
was
sent
thursday
and
shared
with
the
new
york
times
it
cites
the
recent
mass
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
and
gun
violence
in
a
number
of
cities
including
chicago
and
brooklyn
before
declaring
this
is
a
public
health
crisis
that
demands
urgent
action
we
need
our
lawmakers
to
support
common-sense
gun
laws
that
could
prevent
tragedies
like
these
the
letter
reads
that's
why
we
urge
the
senate
to
stand
with
the
american
public
and
take
action
on
gun
safety
by
passing
a
bill
to
require
background
checks
on
all
gun
sales
and
a
strong
red
flag
law
that
would
allow
courts
to
issue
life-saving
extreme
risk
protection
orders
the
letter
does
not
provide
evidence
to
support
the
claim
that
red
flag
laws
have
saved
lives
but
suggests
interventions
in
states
with
extreme
risk
laws
have
already
prevented
potential
tragedies
the
letter
also
fails
to
acknowledge
that
lives
have
also
been
lost
during
the
enforcement
of
existing
gun
grab
orders
as
in
the
case
of
a
maryland
man
last
fall
the
ceo's
of
dick's
sporting
goods
levi
strauss
co
pinterest
and
airbnb
were
all
signatories
on
the
letter
along
with
twitter
ceo
jack
dorsey
dorsey
also
signed
an
open
letter
published
by
the
times
in
june
along
with
more
than
company
leaders
who
argued
that
restricting
abortion
is
bad
for
business
anything
else
nbc
news
reported
that
the
gun
control
letter
was
sent
the
day
after
sens
chris
murphy
d-conn
joe
manchin
d-w
va
and
pat
toomey
r-pa
advocated
for
stricter
background
checks
during
a
phone
call
with
president
donald
trump
and
his
staffers
toomey
told
reporters
after
the
phone
call
i
want
to
be
clear
the
president
did
not
make
a
commitment
to
support
any
particular
bill
or
any
particular
thing
but
he
did
strongly
convey
an
interest
in
doing
something
meaningful
and
something
that
we
would
be
able
to
embrace
and
that
could
pass
