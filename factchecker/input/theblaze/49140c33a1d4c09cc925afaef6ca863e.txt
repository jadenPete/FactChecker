joking
that

a
joke
what
else
elsewhere
in
the
interview
biden
told
colbert
that
he
was
moved
to
run
for
president
after
the
charlottesville
virginia
riots
that
took
place
in
colbert
asked
the
former
vice
president
when
he
decided
to
run
charlottesville
he
said
when
those
folks
came
out
of
the
fields
carrying
torches
with
contorted
faces
carrying
nazi
flags
and
chanting
the
same
anti-semitic
bile
that
was
chanted
in
the
streets
of
germany
in
the
s
and
accompanied
by
white
supremacists
and
the
ku
klux
klan
biden
continued
those
spewing
hate
were
met
by
people
who
said
not
in
my
town
and
a
young
woman
was
killed
when
the
president
was
asked
about
it
he
said
i
thought
there
were
very
fine
people
on
both
sides
no
sitting
president
has
ever
said
anything
like
that
making
a
moral
equivalence
between
haters
and
folks
who
said
no
no
not
in
my
town
i
realized
things
weren't
going
to
change
very
much
with
this
president
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
restore
the
soul
of
this
country

added
