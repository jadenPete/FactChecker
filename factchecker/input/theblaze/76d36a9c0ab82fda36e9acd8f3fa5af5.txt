award-winning
author
suggests
people
shouldn't
even
wear
red
baseball
caps
oh
brother
liberal
author
rebecca
makkai
says
that
no
normal
people
should
wear
any
sort
of
red
baseball
cap
because
the
hats
too
closely
resemble
that
of
the
make
america
great
again
variety
makkai
previously
won
the
national
book
award
with
the
great
believers
a
book
about
the
aids
epidemic
in
the
s
and
s
seriously
makkai
a
chicago-based
author
who
was
once
also
a
finalist
for
a
pulitzer
prize
issued
her
plea
on
aug
via
twitter
needless
to
say
her
request
received
a
lot
of
attention
and
has
gone
viral
as
a
result
at
the
time
of
this
writing
her
original
tweet
had
more
than
comments
on
it
she
fretted
is
anyone
else
made
really
uncomfortable
these
days
by
anyone
wearing
any
kind
of
red
baseball
cap
like
i
see
one
and
my
heart
does
weird
s
t
and
then
i
finally
realize
it
only
says
titleist
or
whatever
maybe
don't
wear
red
caps
anymore
normal
people
that
wasn't
all
makkai
also
suggested
that
such
hats
are
making
other
people
scared
also
for
the
love
of
god
the
clever
folks
wearing
make
america
read
again
or
whatever
caps
no
she
wrote
in
a
follow-up
tweet
you're
making
everyone
scared
don't
do
it
makkai
wasn't
even
done
there
and
went
on
to
compare
red
hats
to
swastikas
after
overwhelming
criticism
she
said
the
swastika
which
was
sacred
to
people
of
hindu
faith
chose
not
to
use
the
symbol
because
of
the
nazis
if
you're
here
to
be
contrary
an
equivalent
here
would
be
western
hindus
choosing
not
to
use
the
swastika
symbol
in
public
despite
it
being
sacred
to
their
faith
because
it
would
offend
frighten
people
she
wrote
the
red
hat
has
become
a
symbol
of
hate
bc
of
how
its
wearers
act
