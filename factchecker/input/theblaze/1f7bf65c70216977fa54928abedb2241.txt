former
combat
veteran's
war
injury

went
on
to
add
america
deserved
dude
f
it
i'm
saying
it
to
his
vile
rant
this
guy
has
the
understanding
of
foreign
policy
of
like
a
year-old
what
the
f
what
the
f
is
wrong
with
this
dude
piker

ing
eye

f
ed
by
a
brave

crenshaw
took
to
twitter
wednesday
to
respond
to
piker's
disgusting
speech
hasan
piker
seems
to
confuse
improvised
explosive
device
with
some
weird
terrorist
fantasy
lol
sorry
for
triggering
you
hasan
you're
no
pete
davidson
stop
trying
so
hard
he
wrote
in
reference
to
the
saturday
night
live
comedian
who
mocked
crenshaw's
war
injury
last
year
but
later
apologized
crenshaw
served
three
tours
in
afghanistan
as
a
navy
seal
and
lost
his
eye
in
an
ied
explosion
on
thursday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
called
piker's
tirade
some
of
the
most
vile
speech
i've
ever
heard
what
was
said
about
dan
crenshaw
yesterday
is
beyond
reprehensible
glenn
asserted
but
as
vile
and
disgusting
as
it
is
i
will
defend
his
right
to
say
this
i
will
not
call
for
him
being
banned
him
being
silenced
or
anything
else
freedom
of
speech
the
first
amendment
means
you
must
stand
up
for
the
most
vile
speech
you
can
comprehend
and
that
is
some
of
the
most
vile
speech
i've
ever
heard
but
he
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
damn
it
to
say
it
and
i
i
hate
saying
that
i
hate
defending
his
right
to
say
those
things
but
that's
what
it's
all
about
this
isn't
something
that
calls
for
somebody
to
be
banned
to
be
pulled
off
the
air
this
calls
for
common
decency
