time
protesters
get
pushback
from
mayor
council
member
who
join
counterprotest
they
want
us
to
get
angry
chula
vista's
mayor
said
of
protesters
they're
saying
they're
praying
for
us
well
i'm
praying
for
them
too
that
they
come
to
some
level
of
understanding
outside
a
public
library
in
chula
vista
california
which
was
hosting
a
pair
of
drag
queens
reading
books
to
children
and
parents
two
groups
with
polar-opposite
beliefs
about
tuesday's
event
squared
off
yelling
and
chanting
at
each
other
one
group
was
opposed
to
the
controversial
drag
queen
story
time
while
a
second
group
supported
the
event
which
has
been
gaining
widespread
popularity
around
the
country
among
those
who
see
it
as
a
way
to
teach
tolerance
and
inclusiveness
to
children
but
supporters
of
the
drag
queen
story
time
got
some
prominent
assistance
from
mayor
mary
salas
and
councilman
steve
padilla
the
san
diego
union-tribune
reported
and
they
weren't
there
to
blend
in
with
the
counterprotesters
they
want
us
to
get
angry
as
drag
queen
story
time
supporters
gathered
in
a
park
before
the
event
padilla
urged
the
group
to
remain
focused
on
their
message
of
love
the
paper
reported
they
want
us
to
get
angry
padilla
told
the
group
according
to
the
union-tribune
they
want
us
to
get
angry
so
they
can
have
a
spectacle
we
are
going
to
do
something
much
more
powerful
he
added
as
the
supporters
applauded
the
paper
said
salas
also
spoke
to
supporters
telling
them
not
to
lose
hope
and
to
keep
trying
to
peacefully
explain
the
purpose
of
the
drag
queen
story
time
the
paper
added
more
from
the
union-tribune
they're
saying
they're
praying
for
us
salas
said
of
the
protesters
the
paper
noted
well
i'm
praying
for
them
too
that
they
come
to
some
level
of
understanding
but
hector
gastelum
who
serves
on
the
otay
water
district
board
criticized
salas
and
padilla
for
promoting
the
event
and
told
the
union-tribune
they
acted
irresponsibly
for
doing
so
this
material
is
just
not
age-appropriate
for
kids
he
added
to
the
paper
lots
of
tension
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
opposition
to
the
drag
queen
story
time
before
the
event
and
among
the
detractors
were
members
of
south
bay
pentecostal
church
who
saw
the
outside
walls
of
their
sanctuary
vandalized
with
satanic
symbols
and
vulgar
phrases
sunday
executive
pastor
amado
huizar
told
knsd-tv
he
believes
his
church
was
targeted
for
members
opposition
we've
stood
up
the
last
several
weeks
to
share
our
concern
regarding
the
upcoming
drag
queen
story
hour
we
feel
that
maybe
perhaps
those
two
are
connected
but
the
union-tribune
said
the
opposition
led
to
a
wave
of
support
and
hundreds
showed
up
to
do
just
that
many
of
whom
chanted
to
protesters
no
hate
no
fear
everyone
is
welcome
here
other
counterprotesters
also
chanted
hey
hey
ho
ho
homophobes
have
got
to
go
however
some
protesters
told
the
paper
they
didn't
believe
the
drag
queen
story
time
was
something
kids
should
witness
different
vibe
inside
but
gabriela
prendimano
who
attended
the
drag
queen
story
time
with
her
daughter
told
the
paper
i'm
not
going
to
let
her
grow
up
thinking
that
it's
ok
to
be
hateful
like
these
people
outside
courtney
ware
went
to
the
event
with
her
toddler
son
and
added
to
the
union-tribune
that
it
was
everything
that
the
library
promised
it
would
be
and
nothing
that
the
haters
said
it
would
be
she
also
told
the
paper
the
whole
room
was
filled
with
positive
energy
i
almost
felt
like
crying
more
from
the
paper
