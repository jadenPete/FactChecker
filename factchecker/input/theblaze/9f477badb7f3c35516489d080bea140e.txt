coffee
shop
worker

calls
customer
f
ing
bigoted
trash

out
and
don't
come
back

outburst
is
costly
the

volunteer
for

u.s.
sen
ben
sasse
marilyn
synek's
only
mistake
after
entering
cultiva
espresso
crepes
on
wednesday
apparently
being
identified
as
a
conservative
because
when
a
transgender
employee
of
the
lincoln
nebraska
coffee
shop
recognized
synek
as
a
former
volunteer
for
republican
u.s.
sen
ben
sasse
as
well
as
being
with
nebraska
family
alliance
a
conservative
policy
organization
that
supports
marriage
and
family
the
unborn
and
religious
liberty
the
employee
lit
into
synek
the
washington
examiner
reported
an
employee
approached
me
called
me
by
name
and
started
yelling
profanities
at
me
the
year-old
communications
specialist
told
the
paper
the
employee
asked
me
to
leave
and
informed
me
that
if
i
tried
to
come
back
i
would
be
denied
service
because
of
my
bigoted
views
synek
who
said
she
has
breakfast
at
the
coffee
shop
once
a
week
also
told
the
examiner
the
employee
declared
you
are
f
ing
bigoted
trash
and
we
do
not
want
you
in
our
restaurant
over
percent
of
the
people
who
work
here
are
queer
you
are
not
f
ing
wanted
in
our
restaurant
so
get
out
and
don't
come
back
what
did
the
employee
have
to
say
later
the
employee
natalie
weiss
wrote
on
facebook
that
when
this
person
was
leaving
the
store
i
told
them
in
no
uncertain
terms
and
admittedly
vulgar
ones
that
they
were
not
welcome
to
come
back
weiss
added
that
nebraska
family
alliance
really
is
a
bigoted
anti-lgbt
qia
organization
who
lobbies
every
year
for
legalized
discrimination
against
my
community
in
my
state
and
that
apparently
cultiva
would
like
their
lgbt
qia
staff
to
understand
they
must
serve
our
literal
societal
oppressors
with
a
smile
what
happened
to
the
employee
cultiva
espresso
crepes
management
wrote
on
facebook
that
the
employee
in
question
was
fired
almost
immediately
following
the
incident
more
from
the
coffee
shop's
statement
how
did
the
employee
react
to
being
fired
a
pissed
weiss
noted
on
facebook
cultiva
espresso
crepes
you
just
let
neo-conservative
trump
allies
drive
out
a
trans
employee
i
hope
you
read
this
go
f
yourselves
so
for
those
keeping
track
in
nebraska
you
can
be
fired
or
lose
your
home
because
you
identify
in
the
lgbt
qia
umbrella
weiss
also
wrote
and
you
can
also
be
fired
for
telling
people
who
fight
for
that
status
quo
to
get
lost
how
did
synek
react
following
the
controversy
according
to
the
lincoln
journal
star
synek
said
that
while
she
believes
americans
can
disagree
politically
she
hopes
the
incident
demonstrates
the
need
for
civility
she
also
noted
that
the
coffee
shop's
owners
apologized
to
her
personally
and
asked
her
to
come
back
the
paper
said
i've
always
enjoyed
their
coffee
and
crepes
and
i
accept
their
apology
