some
video
footage
from
outside
jeffrey
epstein's
cell
declared
unusable
report
reveals
the
latest
development
in
the
epstein
saga
at
least
one
surveillance
camera
monitoring
the
hallway
outside
jeffrey
epstein's
cell
captured
footage
that
is
unusable
for
authorities
investigating
his
death
according
to
a
new
report
the
washington
post
reported
monday
that
while
some
footage
from
the
hallway
inside
the
metropolitan
correctional
center's
special
housing
unit
is
unusable
other
cameras
monitoring
the
area
captured
surveillance
that
investigators
are
able
to
analyze
the
camera
footage
is
considered
critical
to
the
investigation
according
to
the
post
it's
not
clear
why
at
least
one
camera
recorded
unusable
footage
or
what
the
usable
footage
shows
sources
connected
to
the
investigation
told
the
post
it's
also
not
clear
if
the
incident
is
isolated
or
if
camera
problems
are
a
systemic
issue
at
mcc
the
fbi
and
justice
department's
inspector
general's
office
are
leading
the
investigation
since
epstein's
death
on
aug
which
the
new
york
city
medical
examiner
determined
was
death
by
suicide
numerous
issues
from
inside
the
jail
have
fueled
conspiracy
theories
about
epstein's
death
the
chief
concern
is
how
epstein
the
jail's
most
notorious
inmate
managed
to
kill
himself
less
than
three
weeks
after
a
previous
suicide
attempt
it
has
been
revealed
that
epstein
was
taken
off
suicide
watch
just
six
days
after
his
first
attempt
and
was
alone
at
the
time
of
his
death
a
violation
of
jail
policy
to
compound
problems
the
guards
tasked
with
monitoring
epstein
and
other
special
inmates
did
not
check
on
epstein
every
minutes
another
violation
of
jail
policy
they
did
not
do
this
because
they
fell
asleep
for
more
than
three
hours
later
falsifying
jail
records
to
hide
their
blunder
the
employees
have
since
been
placed
on
administrative
leave
while
mcc's
warden
was
reassigned
attorney
general
william
barr
has
also
appointed
a
new
federal
bureau
of
prisons
chief
in
the
wake
of
epstein's
death
