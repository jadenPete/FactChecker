chick-fil-a
opening
at
purdue
u.
irritates
gay
student
body
president
faculty
but
over
petition
signers
see
things
a
little
differently
restaurant
is
set
to
open
on
campus
in
fall
purdue
university
is
set
to
bring
a
chick-fil-a
restaurant
to
campus
in
fall
as
part
of
a
new
residence
hall
it's
a
move
students
have
wanted
for
a
long
long
long
long
time
rob
wynkoop
the
school's
director
of
service
enterprises
told
the
lafayette
journal
courier
student
body
presidents
and
their
cabinets
have
actually
run
on
that
platform
to
bring
chick-fil-a
to
campus
but
don't
put
the
school's
new
student
body
president
in
that
group
jo
boileau
noted
to
the
paper
that
as
an
openly
gay
student
the
chick-fil-a
opening
is
something
i'm
confronting
on
a
daily
basis
in
conversations
i'm
having
every
single
day
with
students
on
this
campus
according
to
the
journal
courier
boileau
wondered
if
purdue
could
give
back
millions
of
dollars
from
papa
john's
founder
john
schnatter
in
because
of
racist
remarks
what
message
is
the
school
sending
to
the
lgbtq
community
by
opening
a
chick-fil-a
on
campus
what's
the
background
the
left
has
targeted
chick-fil-a
for
years
due
to
ownership's
pro-traditional
family
and
christian
views
which
opponents
have
incorrectly
equated
to
an
anti-gay
stance
not
surprisingly
chick-fil-a
also
has
gotten
pushback
from
left-wing
faculty
and
students
on
numerous
college
campuses
it's
no
different
at
purdue
the
school's
faculty
is
expected
to
vote
on
a
measure
in
october
to
pressure
the
administration
to
make
sure
that
commercial
ventures
on
campus
uphold
the
same
values
and
promote
inclusivity
with
their
policies
hiring
practices
and
actions
the
journal
courier
said
with
regard
to
chick-fil-a
coming
to
campus
linda
prokopy
a
professor
and
member
of
the
university
senate's
equity
and
diversity
committee
told
the
paper
there
are
students
there
are
staff
and
there
are
faculty
on
this
campus
who
are
hurting
by
a
decision
made
by
this
university
chick-fil-a
representatives
did
not
immediately
respond
to
questions
monday
about
the
issue
the
paper
reported
can
plus
chick-fil-a
fans
be
wrong
in
stark
contrast
to
purdue's
faculty
and
its
new
student
body
president
students
in
started
a
petition
at
change
org
titled
purdue
needs
a
chick-fil-a
the
journal
courier
said
as
of
thursday
morning
folks
have
signed
it
student
riley
johnson
who
signed
the
petition
told
the
paper
that
chick-fil-a's
stances
do
not
cross
my
mind
when
i
go
there
or
affect
my
eating
habits
i
personally
believe
a
private
company
should
have
the
freedom
to
take
a
political
or
religious
stance
if
they
choose
if
people
don't
agree
with
it
then
they
don't
have
to
eat
there
that
is
their
choice
david
bergsma
also
signed
the
petition
and
told
the
journal
courier
he
was
in
a
room
with
other
students
when
the
exciting
news
of
chick-fil-a
coming
to
campus
was
announced
the
general
response
was
cheering
and
gratitude
gratitude
that
purdue
actually
saw
the
petition
and
listened
to
us
bergsma
added
to
the
paper
i
think
the
number
of
people
trying
to
keep
chick-fil-a
off
our
campus
because
of
their
political
stances
is
a
small
minority
most
students
couldn't
care
less
we
just
want
the
amazing
food
they
have
