jay-z
is
an

in

hypocrisy
the

launched

multiyear
partnership
with
rapper
jay-z's
entertainment
company
roc
nation
with
the
intent
of
working
together
on
the
league's
live
game
experience
and
increasing
social
justice
efforts
but
the
alliance
has
drawn
criticism
from
allies
of
activist
and
former
quarterback
colin
kaepernick
according
to
espn
roc
nation
will
advise
the
league
on
aspects
of
entertainment
including
the
super
bowl
halftime
performance
and
the
company
will
use
the
combination
of

and
music
to
make
a
positive
impact
in
communities

kaepernick
allies
including
the
atlantic
columnist
jemele
hill
former
kaepernick
teammate
eric
reid
and
kaepernick's
girlfriend
nessa
diab
were
critical
of
jay-z
given
name
shawn
carter
partnering
with
the
league
that
they
believe
has
blackballed
kaepernick
hill
wrote
a
particularly
scathing
column
in
the
atlantic
titled
jay
z
helped
the
nfl
banish
colin
kaepernick
by
leaving
kaepernick
completely
out
of
the
mix
jay-z
is
now
complicit
in
helping
the
nfl
execute
its
strategy
hill
wrote
now
he
is
an
accomplice
in
the
league's
hypocrisy
carter
defended
the
deal
during
a
news
conference
wednesday
saying
his
goal
is
to
advance
the
cause
that
kaepernick
started
with
his
protests
we
forget
that
colin's
whole
thing
was
to
bring
attention
to
social
injustice
carter
said
in
that
case
this
is
a
success
this
is
the
next
phase
there
are
two
parts
of
protesting
you
go
outside
and
you
protest
and
then
the
company
or
the
individual
says
i
hear
you
what
do
we
do
next
for
me
it's
like
an
actionable
item
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
it
everyone
heard
we
hear
what
you're
saying
and
everybody
knows
i
agree
with
what
you're
saying
in
kaepernick's
underlying
message
so
what
are
we
gonna
do
you
know
what
i'm
saying
help
millions
and
millions
of
people
or
we
get
stuck
on
colin
not
having
a
job
eric
reid
who
was
kaepernick's
teammate
with
the
san
francisco
ers
and
joined
kaepernick
in
kneeling
during
the
national
anthem
accused
jay-z
of
putting
money
over
principle
these
aren't
mutually
exclusive
reid
said
of
carter's
comment
about
moving
forward
versus
getting
stuck
on
kaepernick's
employment
status
they
can
both
happen
at
the
same
time
it
looks
like
your
goal
was
to
make
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
by
assisting
the
nfl
in
burying
colin's
career
carter
dismissed
the
idea
that
he
should
be
boycotted
or
cancelled
due
to
his
partnership
with
the
nfl
saying
that
you
have
to
work
with
those
with
whom
you
disagree
in
order
to
have
progress
people
have
to
evolve
people
have
to
want
to
be
better
and
people
have
to
want
to
have
conversations
