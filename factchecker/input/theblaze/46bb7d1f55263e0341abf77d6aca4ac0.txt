we
cannot
cross
this
line
glenn
beck
warns
red
flag
laws
could
lead
to
civil
war
in
america
that's
against
everything
we
stand
for
a
recent
poll
shows
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
americans
regardless
of
political
affiliation
support
red
flag
laws
or
extreme
risk
protection
orders
which
would
allow
family
members
or
law
enforcement
to
initiate
a
court
order
to
take
away
an
individual's
right
to
own
a
firearm
on
wednesday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
stu
burguiere
and
pat
gray
agreed
that
while
red
flag
laws
may
sound
good
in
theory
they
can
easily
be
weaponized
and
used
to
take
gun
rights
away
from
law-abiding
citizens
you
cannot
consider
yourself
a
small
government
constitutionalist
if
you
believe
in
gun
control
and
infringement
glenn
said
look
i
have
no
problem
if
you
are
deemed
dangerous
after
you
have
had
the
chance
to
testify
but
you
are
innocent
until
proven
guilty
we
cannot
cross
this
line
that
is
craziness
that's
against
everything
we
stand
for
he
added
you're
taking
away
a
person's
right
to
be
innocent
before
guilty
what
you're
doing
is
you're
starting
down
this
slippery
slope
that
we're
going
to
look
at
you
as
guilty
and
everybody
will
know
you're
guilty
and
we're
going
to
take
your
guns
and
good
luck
getting
them
back
by
the
way
personally
i
think
that
is
civil
war
