democrat's
wife
goes
on
a

personal
rant
on
social

and
accidentally
slams
obamacare
i'm
just
flabbergasted
the
wife
of
a
democratic
member
of
congress
went
on
a
very
personal
rant
about
her
healthcare
on
social
media
and
inadvertently
provided
evidence
for
critics
of
obamacare
amanda
cunningham
the
wife
of
rep
joe
cunningham
d-s
c.
complained
about
the
limitations
of
her
government-subsidized
healthcare
program
one
associated
with
former
president
obama's
landmark
legislation
i'm
gonna
have
a
little
bit
of
a
rant
here
on
social
media
because
i
think
this
is
important
she
said
on
a
video
posted
to
her
instagram
account
i've
been
going
over
my
this
is
a
not-a-bill
bill
here
from
blue
cross
blue
shield
and
realizing
that
once
again
all
of
my
mental
health
therapy
sessions
are
denied
in
addition
to
all
of
our
marriage
counseling
sessions
she
explained
it's
just
mind-blowing
to
me
that
these
basic
well-known
needs
that
mental
health
is
health
care
are
still
being
denied
that
we're
still
fighting
for
these
absolutely
basic
things
it's
unbelievable
to
me
she
continued
she
added
that
she
was
going
to
pressure
her
husband
to
push
legislation
to
change
healthcare
laws
to
provide
the
coverage
she
was
demanding
let's
go
to
the
house
floor
let's
write
a
bill
i
don't
know
what
you
do
but
let's
do
it
because
this
is
ridiculous
she
added
this
affects
us
our
family
it
affects
everyone
else
who's
seeking
mental
health
and
needs
support
doing
so
she
concluded
i'm
just
flabbergasted
some
on
social
media
criticized
her
for
what
they
saw
as
an
entitled
attitude
about
healthcare
insurance
especially
that
which
has
been
written
into
law
by
democrats
president
donald
trump
has
taken
measures
to
undermine
obamacare
most
notably
in
october
when
he
announced
that
he
would
cease
cost-sharing
reduction
payments
to
insurance
companies
here's
