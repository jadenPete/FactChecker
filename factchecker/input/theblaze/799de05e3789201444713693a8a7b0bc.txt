the

turned
out
to
not

in
their
favor
a
couple
in

reportedly
discovered
the
hard
way
that
they
should
not
have
spent
money
deposited
in
their
account
by
a
banking
error
what

monopoly
one

the
best

in
the

chest

reads
bank
error
in

collect
but
life
advice
should
never
be
taken
from
a
board
game
and
this
is
no
exception
to
that
rule
robert
and
tiffany
williams
of
pennsylvania
were
surprised
to
see
an
extra
in
their
bank
account

sun-gazette
reported
that
before
the
mistake
they
had
only
in
their
bank
account
the
money
was
supposed
to
go
into
the
account
of
an
investment
firm
but
a
bank
teller
had
mistakenly
deposited
it
in
the
williams
account
rather
than
contacting
the
bank
and
reporting
the
error
the
couple
did
what
many
people
would
undoubtedly
be
at
least
tempted
to
do
they
went
on
a
spending
spree
then
on
june
bb
t
called
to
demand
that
the
couple
return
the
money
the
company
had
removed
the
money
from
their
account
which
had
resulted
in
their
account
being
overdrawn
by
state
trooper
aaron
brown
said
in
a
statement
that
tiffany
williams
told
the
bank
that
she
no
longer
had
the
funds
because
she
had
already
paid
off
bills
she
told
the
bank
her
husband
had
spent
a
great
portion
of
the
funds
and
purchased
a
four-wheeler
she
said
she
would
speak
to
her
husband
and
attempt
to
construct
a
repayment
agreement
but
following
this
indication
that
she
was
willing
to
pay
wnep-tv

bb
t
was

police
involved
the
two
were
arrested
and
are
currently
out
on
bail
what
else
