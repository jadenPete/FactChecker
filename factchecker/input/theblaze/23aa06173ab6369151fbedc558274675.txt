calls
former
ice

bigoted
during
hearing
and
gets
a
stinging
response
i've

more
about
this
issue
than
you'll
ever
know
rep
debbie
wasserman
schultz
d-fla
got
a
stinging
response
when
she
called
the
testimony
of
former
ice
director
thomas
homan
bigoted
and
jingoistic
the
altercation
came
during
homan's
testimony
before
the
house
oversight
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
subcommittee
on
thursday
i
think
it's
important
to
really
make
sure
that
the
jingoistic
bigoted
testimony
of
mr
homan
is
called
out
as
nearly
completely
untrue
as
being
an
outrage
schultz
said
and
as
a
former
official
directing
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
he
should
know
better
homan
fired
right
back
what
did
i
say
was
inaccurate
homan
exclaimed
i
just
think
it's
important
that
it's
not
accepted
as
accurate
testimony
said
schultz
homan
returned
to
the
subject
when
he
was
given
time
to
respond
to
schultz
later
in
the
hearing
if
i
can
respond
to
the
earlier
remark
from
wasserman
schultz
i've
forgotten
more
about
this
issue
than
you'll
ever
know
he
said
sternly
so
if
you
say
my
testimony
is
inaccurate
it's
wrong
homan
continued
everything
i
said
here
is
accurate
bottom
line
if
you
want
to
go
toe
to
toe
i'm
here
i'm
here
on
my
own
time
to
speak
to
the
american
people
about
what's
false
and
what's
fact
i'm
happy
to
go
toe
to
toe
with
you
mr
homan
schultz
replied
i'm
happy
to
do
that
any
day
then
you
gotta
let
me
respond
to
your
question
rather
than
dropping
a
bomb
and
running
away
homan
shot
back
homan
was
also
praised
by
many
for
defending
ice
officers
against
the
criticism
of
rep
alexandria
