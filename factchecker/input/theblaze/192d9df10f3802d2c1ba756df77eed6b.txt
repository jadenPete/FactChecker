kavanaugh
accuser
christine
blasey
ford
came
forward
partially
to
protect
abortion
rights
her
attorney
says
that's
not
what
she
said
at
the
time
christine
blasey
ford
the
california
professor
who
accused
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
of
sexual
assault
before
his
confirmation
was
partially
motivated
to
come
forward
because
of
her
opposition
to
kavanaugh's
stance
on
abortion
according
to
her
attorney
the
attorney
debra
katz
made
the
revelation
in
a
video
obtained
by
the
daily
caller
her
comments
were
first
reported
by
ryan
lovelace
author
of
the
upcoming
book
search
and
destroy
inside
the
campaign
against
brett
kavanaugh
katz
represented
ford
when
she
testified
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
katz
was
speaking
in
april
at
the
university
of
baltimore's
th
feminist
legal
theory
conference
when
she
said
the
following
a
common
fear
expressed
by
opponents
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
was
the
belief
that
he
would
allow
the
conservative-leaning
court
to
overturn
roe
v
wade
and
dismantle
federal
abortion
rights
at
the
time
her
accusation
became
public
in
september
ford
said
she
felt
she
needed
to
come
forward
out
of
a
sense
of
civic
responsibility
kavanaugh's
confirmation
hearings
were
much
less
about
his
credentials
as
a
judge
and
primarily
about
his
character
and
alleged
behavior
as
a
high
school
and
college
student
despite
ford's
accusation
and
several
other
unsubstantiated
allegations
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
by
the
senate
last
year
