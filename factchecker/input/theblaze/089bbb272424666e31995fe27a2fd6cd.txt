well
said
during
a
campaign
stop
in

new
hampshire
on
friday
a
supporter
of
democratic
presidential
contender
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
called

mentally

retarded
actions
of
this
guy
the

asked

well

harris
responded
with
a
laugh
well
i
plan
to
win
this
election
i'll
tell
you
that
after
backlash
harris
responded
to
the
incident
on
saturday
claiming
that
she
didn't
hear
the
words
her
supporter
used
despite
laughing
at
what
he
said
when
my
staff
played
the
video
from
my
town
hall
yesterday
it
was
upsetting
i
didn't
hear
the
words
the
man
used
in
that
moment
but
if
i
had
i
would've
stopped
and
corrected
him
harris
said
i'm
sorry
that
word
and
others
like
it
aren't
acceptable
ever
later
after
being
confronted
by
an
nbc
reporter
at
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
state
convention
harris
doubled
down
let
me
just
be
really
clear
i
would
never
condone
that
kind
of
language
being
spoken
by
anybody
about
anybody
it
is
offensive
she
said
according
to
politico
i
would
never
condone
anyone
using
that
word
in
any
way
shape
or
form
even
against
the
guy
i
am
running
against
period
what
was
the
reaction
considering
harris
laughed
at
the
supporter's
choice
of
words
people
did
not
believe
harris
claim
that
she
didn't
hear
what
the
man
said
i'm
glad
you
know
you're
in
the
wrong
but
what
exactly
were
you
laughing
at
he
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
this
president
if
we
believe
your
story
you
laugh
at
basic
questions
or
you
r
lying
not
a
good
look
one
person
responded
on
social
media
i
think
it's
clear
that
you
heard
him
and
supported
his
use
of
those
words
if
you
get
the
nomination
i
will
be
voting
third
party
another
person
said
this
is
the
what
th
or
th
time
that
harris
has
claimed
impaired
hearing
to
excuse
herself
from
accountability
in
the
campaign
another
person
responded
you
told
him
that's
a
great
way
to
put
it
but
okayyyyyy
another
critic
said
those
hurt
by
these
words
hear
them
clearly
whenever
they
are
used
like
hateful
racial
slurs
they
ring
clear
to
those
that
suffer
from
their
violent
history
if
you
didn't
hear
what
the
man
yelled
out
what
exactly
were
you
laughing
at
when
you
replied
well
