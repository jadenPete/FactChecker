way
that
omar

tlaib
speak
about
president
donald
trump
i
couldn't
be
here
because
i
couldn't
be
alive
answered
amir
i
said
probably
we
don't
have
as
much
freedom
as
the
supreme
leader
claims
because
of
that
they
sent
me
for
eight
years
to
jail
with
a
lot
of
torture
and
they
broke
both
my
wrists
and
a
lot
of
bones
in
my
body
have
been
broken
my
family
didn't
know
if
i
was
alive
or
not
we
suffered
a
lot
under
the
same
type
of
regime
that
ilhan
omar
and
rashida
