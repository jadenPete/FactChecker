neil
cavuto
fires
back
a
scathing
response
to
president
trump
after
complaint
against
fox
news
i
don't
work
for
you
my
job
is
to
cover
you
not
fawn
over
you
president
donald
trump
offered
yet
another
criticism
against
fox
news
and
neil
cavuto
responded
with
a
scathing
rejection
of
his
claims
the
fox
news
host
replied
to
the
president
at
the
end
of
his
show
on
thursday
alright
well
i
think
the
president
watches
fox
i
also
think
he
is
getting
sick
of
fox
which
is
weird
becuase
i
think
he
gets
pretty
fair
coverage
at
fox
said
cavuto
but
the
president
making
clear
to
fact-check
him
is
to
be
all
but
dead
to
him
and
his
legion
of
supporters
who
let
me
know
in
no
uncertain
terms
i
am
either
with
him
totally
or
i
am
a
never-trumper
bully
he
continued
there
are
no
grays
no
middle
grounds
you
are
either
all
in
or
you're
just
out
loyal
on
everything
or
not
to
be
trusted
on
anything
he
explained
cavuto
addressed
a
tweet
that
the
president
lobbed
at
the
cable
news
channel
first
of
all
mr
president
we
don't
work
for
you
cavuto
continued
i
don't
work
for
you
my
job
is
to
cover
you
not
fawn
over
you
or
rip
you
just
cover
you
call
balls
and
strikes
our
job
is
to
keep
score
not
settle
scores
he
explained
you
are
right
for
a
media
isn't
fair
to
you
that
they
are
more
inclined
to
report
the
bad
than
anything
good
about
you
so
it's
no
surprise
you
are
frustrated
that
more
aren't
in
line
with
you
that
everyone
at
fox
might
not
be
in
lockstep
with
you
cavuto
said
hard
as
it
is
to
fathom
mr
president
just
because
you're
the
leader
of
the
free
world
it
doesn't
entitle
you
to
a
free
pass
he
said
unfortunately
just
a
free
press
he
concluded
here's
the
video
of
cavuto's
reply
cavuto
president
trump
fox
news
doesn't
work
for
you
