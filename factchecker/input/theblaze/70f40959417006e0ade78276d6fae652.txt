top
trump
campaign
official
reveals
which
dem
the
trump
campaign
fears
most
the
one
who
scares
me
the
most
in
the
general
is
although
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
is
not
the
front-runner
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
she
is
reportedly
the
candidate
whom
the
trump
campaign
fears
most
the
one
who
scares
me
the
most
in
the
general
is
kamala
harris
a
top
trump
campaign
official
told
the
washington
times
this
week
the
top
candidates
are
all
flawed
candidates
but
the
least
flawed
is
kamala
harris
the
official
who
the
times
described
as
a
key
player
in
the
campaign
explained
unfortunately
for
harris
mediocre
debate
performances
have
tempered
her
campaign's
momentum
through
the
summer
months
after
surging
through
the
spring
harris
launched
her
campaign
amid
widespread
democratic
enthusiasm
in
january
drawing
a
campaign
kickoff
crowd
of
roughly
people
a
larger
crowd
than
what
then-sen
barack
obama
drew
in
when
launching
his
presidential
campaign
harris
currently
stands
fourth
among
the
crowded
field
of
democrats
behind
front-runner
joe
biden
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
however
harris
stands
to
gain
the
most
through
the
fall
and
into
the
primary
season
early
next
year
enthusiasm
for
biden
has
already
begun
waning
over
continues
gaffes
and
his
political
history
meanwhile
although
warren
is
surging
both
she
and
sanders
are
seen
as
far-left
socialists
both
candidates
will
be
a
tough
sell
for
most
americans
who
are
much
closer
to
the
political
center
than
the
far-left
harris
is
perhaps
the
most
moderate
top
democrat
competing
for
the
nomination
which
will
undoubtedly
help
her
when
democrats
hit
the
polls
next
year
in
fact
harris
admitted
last
month
that
part
of
her
campaign
strategy
thus
far
has
included
holding
close
to
her
campaign
promises
i'm
not
churning
out
plans
like
a
factory
because
it
is
really
important
to
me
that
any
plan
that
i'm
prepared
to
implement
is
actually
doable
she
said
indeed
if
america
learned
anything
in
it
is
that
the
most
politically-savvy
candidate
will
be
victorious
despite
what
polls
predict
