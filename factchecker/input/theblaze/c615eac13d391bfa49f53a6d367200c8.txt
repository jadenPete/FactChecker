chappelle
has
been
criticized
previously
for
his
transgender
jokes
but
he
has
fired
right
back
against
the
culture
of
political
correctness
what
i
didn't
realise
at
the
time
was
that
i
was
breaking
an
unwritten
and
unspoken
rule
of
show
business
chappelle
said
in
the
stand-up
special
titled
sticks
stones
no
matter
what
you
do
in
your
artistic
expression
you
are
never
ever
allowed
to
upset
the
alphabet
people
he
continued
you
know
who
i
mean
those
people
who
took
of
the
alphabet
for
themselves
i'm
talking
about
them
ls
and
bs
and
gs
and
the
ts
chappelle
was
referring
to
the
lgbt
lobby
which
stands
for
lesbian
gay
bisexual
and
transgender
rights
i
feel
bad
for
the
ts
but
they're
so
confusing
he
continued
the
fact
is
if
a
person
can
be
born
in
the
wrong
body
they
have
to
admit
that's
a
f
ing
hilarious
predicament
the
lgbt
news
site
pink
news
describes
the
rest
of
the
joke
chappelle
then
goes
on
to
do
a
racist
impression
of
a
chinese
person
pretending
that
chinese
is
how
i
feel
inside
he
continues
in
the
same
vein
say
lebron
james
changed
his
gender
can
he
stay
in
the
nba
or
does
he
have
to
go
to
the
wnba
where
he
will
score
points
a
game
many
transgender
allies
and
advocates
on
social
media
account
were
offended
by
the
jokes
