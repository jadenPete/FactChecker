police
in
baltimore
and
new
york
city
are
making
fewer
arrests
and
officers
are
complaining
that
it's
because
overbearing
reforms
make
it
too
risky
to
engage
with
suspects
according
to
hot
air
the
high-profile
deaths
of
black
suspects
in
police
custody
in
baltimore
and
new
york
city
have
resulted
in
more
oversight
and
accountability
for
officers
when
they
use
force
to
apprehend
a
suspect
for
some
officers
the
scrutiny
causes
them
to
think
twice
before
getting
involved
i
don't
feel
pride
for
having
uses
of
force
one
baltimore
officer
told
the
washington
post
now
i
am
afraid
to
arrest
anyone
because
i
don't
want
to
have
so
many
uses
of
force
documented
against
me
baltimore
police
commissioner
michael
harrison
told
the
post
that
some
officers
are
reluctant
for
fear
of
getting
hurt
or
getting
in
trouble
for
making
mistakes
baltimore
has
implemented
a
consent
decree
that
seeks
to
have
the
department
operate
with
more
transparency
through
internal
reporting
and
more
public
interaction
violent
crime
has
been
on
the
rise
in
baltimore
in
recent
years
with
some
critics
attributing
it
to
reforms
causing
police
to
be
less
aggressive
against
crime
we
don't
get
out
of
our
patrol
cars
like
we
used
to
because
we
are
afraid
that
if
we
do
then
we
might
have
to
level
up
one
officer
said
in
new
york
city
officers
have
similar
complaints
after
former

pantaleo
was
fired
for
allegedly
killing
a
man
with
a

during
an

law
enforcement
community

referring
to
the

effect

to
the
new
york
post
after
the
number
of
arrests
dropped
significantly
after
pantaleo's
firing
according
to
the
new
york
post
accountability
became
a
priority
in
these
departments
due
to
the
unnecessary
and
possibly
malicious
intent
that
led
to
the
death
of
eric
garner
in
new
york
and
the
death
of
freddie
gray
in
baltimore
garner
was
allegedly
choked
out
by
pantaleo
while
being
restrained
by
multiple
officers
during
an
arrest
for
allegedly
selling
cigarettes
illegally
pantaleo
avoided
federal
charges
in
garner's
death
despite
the
new
york
city
medical
examiner
determining
that
it
was
a
homicide
freddie
gray
was
killed
after
being
transported
unsecured
in
a
police
van
against
protocol
having
suffered
head
and
injuries
consistent
with
a
car
crash
and
severe
spinal
injuries
that
are
thought
to
have
come
from
a
rough
arrest
the
involved
officers
also
avoided
charges
