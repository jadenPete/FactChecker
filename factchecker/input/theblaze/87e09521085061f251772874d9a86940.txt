lawsuit
alleges
that
pain
was
indescribable
a
colorado
woman
is
suing
after
being
forced
to
give
birth
alone
in
a
jail
cell
while
deputies
and
medical
staff
at
the
jail
allegedly
ignored
her
when
she
told
them
she
was
about
to
give
birth
according
to
the
washington
post
diana
sanchez
gave
birth
to
her
son
in
her
jail
cell
bed
at
denver
county
jail
alone
on
the
morning
of
july
the
birth
was
captured
on
the
jail's
surveillance
cameras
which
also
recorded
her
writhing
and
crying
out
in
pain
as
she
labored
for
hours
leading
up
to
the
birth
sanchez
who
had
arrived
at
the
jail
on
july
eight
months
pregnant
said
she
told
the
deputy
who
delivered
her
breakfast
at
a
m
that
she
was
having
contractions
and
told
other
deputies
and
nurses
the
same
thing
at
least
eight
times
but
she
still
didn't
receive
any
medical
care
or
transportation
to
the
hospital
that
pain
was
indescribable
and
what
hurt
me
more
though
is
the
fact
that
nobody
cared
sanchez
said
in
an
interview
with
kdvr
last
year
the
extent
of
the
assistance
sanchez
was
given
was
an
absorbent
pad
to
lie
on
after
her
water
broke
a
deputy
came
in
and
then
informed
a
nurse
of
the
situation
but
they
didn't
call
an
ambulance
they
just
scheduled
a
van
to
take
her
to
the
hospital
after
all
new
detainees
had
been
booked
which
was
an
hourslong
process
eventually
sanchez
gave
birth
to
her
son
who
tumbled
out
onto
the
bed
a
man
wearing
surgical
gloves
then
entered
the
cell
and
examined
the
baby
sanchez
and
the
baby
weren't
transported
to
the
hospital
until
more
than
a
half
hour
after
the
birth
according
to
the
lawsuit
sanchez
said
the
doctors
at
the
hospital
told
her
she
could've
bled
to
death
the
denver
sheriff
department
conducted
an
internal
investigation
and
cleared
all
deputies
of
wrongdoing
determining
that
the
deputies
took
the
appropriate
actions
under
the
circumstances
and
followed
the
relevant
policies
and
procedures
that's
just
emblematic
of
how
broken
the
system
really
is
said
sanchez's
attorney
mari
newman
they
claim
to
have
done
a
review
and
their
conclusion
is
that
nothing
was
wrong
with
the
fact
that
a
woman
was
never
taken
to
the
hospital
and
ended
up
giving
birth
in
a
dirty
cold
hard
jail
cell
it's
really
unfathomable
sanchez
is
suing
the
city
and
county
of
denver
denver
health
medical
center
and
six
individuals
