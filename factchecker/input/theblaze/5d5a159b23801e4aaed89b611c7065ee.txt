trump-supporting
entertainers
backfired
actor
eric
mccormack
says
he
doesn't
actually
support
blacklisting
his
fellow
entertainers
despite
issuing
remarks
appearing
to
the
contrary
just
days
ago
last
week
the
will
grace
actor
responded
to
a
report
by
the
hollywood

an
upcoming
beverly

donald
trump's
reelection
bid
mccormack
tweeted
at
the
news
outlet
hey
thr
kindly
report
on
everyone
attending
this
event
so
the
rest
of
us
can
be
clear
about
who
we
don't
want
to
work
with
thx
his
co-star
debra
messing
also
shared
similar
sentiments
on
social
media
what
is
he
saying
now
mccormack
attempted
to
clarify
his
remarks
on
tuesday
and
told
his
instagram
followers
that
he
doesn't
support
blacklists
he
wrote
i
want
to
be
clear
about
my
social
media
post
from
last
week
which
has
been
misinterpreted
in
a
very
upsetting
way
i
absolutely
do
not
support
blacklists
or
discrimination
of
any
kind
as
anyone
who
knows
me
would
attest
i'd
simply
like
to
understand
where
trump's
major
donations
are
coming
from
which
is
a
matter
of
public
record
i
am
holding
myself
responsible
for
making
educated
and
informed
decisions
that
i
can
morally
and
ethically
stand
by
and
to
do
that
transparency
is
essential
he
added
users
have
liked
mccormack's
post
more
than
times
at
the
time
of
this
writing
what
else
mccormack
received
a
heavy
amount
of
backlash
from
both
the
left
and
the
right
after
his
initial
remarks
the
view
co-host
whoopi
goldberg
criticized
the
idea
of
a
blacklist
on
tuesday's
show
listen
the
last
time
people
did
this
people
ended
up
killing
themselves
goldberg
said
about
such
tweets
this
is
not
a
good
idea
ok
she
added
your
idea
of
who
you
don't
want
to
work
with
is
your
personal
business
do
not
encourage
people
to
print
out
lists
because
the
next
list
that
comes
out
your
name
will
be
on
it
and
then
people
will
be
coming
after
you
we
had
something
called
a
blacklist
and
a
lot
of
really
good
people
were
accused
of
stuff
she
continued
referring
to
the
so-called
red
scare
and
hollywood
blacklists
that
began
in
the
late
s
and
continued
until
nobody
cared
whether
it
was
true
or
not
they
were
accused
and
they
lost
their
right
to
work
you
don't
have
the
right
in
this
country
people
can
vote
for
who
they
want
to
she
added
that
is
one
of
the
great
rights
of
this
country
