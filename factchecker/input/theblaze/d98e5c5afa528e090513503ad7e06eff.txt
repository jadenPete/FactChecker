unintended
consequences
a
medical
center
in
texas
tried
to
get
rid
of
a
booming
bird
population
in
its
trees
and
accidentally
created
the
perfect
habitat
for
one
of
the
most
poisonous
insects
in
north
america
wait
what
happened
the
texas
medical
center
in
houston
had
an
issue
with
birds
crowding
the
trees
around
its
campus
in
addition
to
being
obnoxious
these
birds
can
spread
disease
so
in
an
effort
to
solve
this
problem
it
placed
nets
on
those
trees
this
is
not
an
uncommon
way
to
deal
with
bird
infestations
but
in
this
case
it
had
an
unintended
side
effect
the
birds
were
apparently
eating
the
megalopyge
opercularis
more
commonly
known
as
a
puss
caterpillar
or
asp
this
caterpillar
has
venomous
spines
that
can
lead
to
a
serious
reaction
in
humans
although
these
caterpillars
are
not
uncommon
in
texas
the
removal
of
the
birds
led
to
a
more
than
percent
increase
in
their
population
near
the
medical
center
according
to
a
sept
research
article
published
by
the
royal
society
the
study
looked
at
the
unforeseen
consequences
of
ecological
disturbance
for
species
interactions
mattheau
comerford
a
graduate
student
who
worked
on
the
study
said
in
a
statement
reported
by
newsweek
the
effects
from
the
sting
of
this
particular
caterpillar
can
be
delayed
it
takes
about
minutes
before
the
pain
kicks
in
so
you
might
not
even
realize
you've
been
stung
at
first
it
feels
like
a
broken
bone
and
the
pain
lasts
for
hours
i
was
stung
on
the
wrist
and
the
pain
traveled
up
my
arm
into
my
armpit
and
my
jaw
started
to
feel
pain
comerford
said
anything
else
in
addition
to
the
nets
pest
control
specialist
mikal
shamsi
told
the
houston
chronicle
in
late
that
the
caterpillars
were
also
showing
up
in
greater
numbers
later
in
the
year
because
of
hurricane
harvey
which
hit
houston
particularly
hard
changed
the
caterpillar's
reproductive
cycle
