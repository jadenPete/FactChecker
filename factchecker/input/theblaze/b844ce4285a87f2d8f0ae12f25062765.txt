left-wing
activist
author
and
democratic
presidential
candidate
marianne
williamson
has
a
plan
to
fight
the
united
states
current
gun
crisis
and
it
includes
banning
bullets
and
expanding
the
size
of
the
u.s.
federal
government
the
liberal
peacenik
known
for
her
plan
to
harness
love
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
her
new
age-y
understanding
of
america's
soulful
ache
as
alyssa
milano
put
it
and
her
yodeling
gained
serious
notoriety
after
the
first
two
democratic
primary
debates
following
the
first
debate
in
miami
in
june
republicans
noted
her
quirkiness
and
made
a
push
to
get
gop
supporters
to
make
donations
to
williamson's
campaign
to
help
her
clear
the
minimum-donors
threshold
for
the
second
debate
in
detroit
hoping
that
williamson's
presence
would
embarrass
the
democratic
party
with
their
help
the
former
spiritual
counselor
for
oprah
winfrey
qualified
for
the
motor
city
madness
in
july
her
weirdness
led
her
to
be
the
most
googled
candidate
during
the
second
democratic
debate
and
has
gained
her
fame
among
the
far-left
reaches
of
the
democratic
party
however
she
failed
to
qualify
for
the
third
debate
on
sept
in
houston
what's
this
about
bullets
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
titled
america
doesn't
just
have
a
gun
crisis
it
has
a
culture
crisis
published
in
the
wake
of
the
odessa
texas
shooting
williamson
first
offered
the
usual
litany
of
liberal
demands
following
a
mass
shooting
universal
background
checks
close
the
alleged
gun-show
loophole
get
rid
of
bump
stocks
and
ban
scary-looking
semi-automatic
rifles
that
anti-gun
politicians
and
activist
have
successfully
labeled
assault
weapons
but
she
added
something
interesting
to
her
things-to-ban
list
bullets
of
course
we
need
universal
background
checks
we
need
to
close
all
loopholes
we
need
to
outlaw
bump
stocks
and
we
need
to
outlaw
assault
weapons
and
the
bullets
needed
to
shoot
them
she
wrote
emphasis
added
so-called
assault
weapons
do
not
require
special
or
unique
ammunition
the
rounds
used
in
those
rifles
are
the
same
rounds
used
in
normal
rifles
were
the
words
williamson
wrote
and
the
post
published
an
error
based
on
a
misunderstanding
of
firearms
or
an
admission
of
the
anti-gun
crowd's
plan
for
undermining
second
amendment
rights
no
one
knows
because
williamson
didn't
elaborate
and
the
post
apparently
did
not
want
her
to
a
new
federal
department
williamson
lamented
the
state
of
america's
violent
culture
though
nothing
that
as
individuals
americans
are
not
a
violent
people
she
said
u.s.
politicians
need
to
stop
worrying
only
about
symptoms
and
start
getting
to
the
root
problems
where
is
the
u.s.
riddled
with
violence
williamson
explained
sort
of
williamson
went
on
to
state
that
though
gun
control
ideas
are
something
to
work
toward
the
united
states
tendency
for
brute
force
rather
than
diplomacy
shows
that
there's
little
hope
the
current
governmental
structure
can
actually
provide
a
solution
to
violence
for
proof
she
noted
that
the
pentagon
budget
vastly
outsizes
that
of
the
state
department
she
wrote
williamson
has
a
solution
however
she
wants
to
expand
the
size
of
government
by
creating
a
new
u.s.
department
of
peace
among
the
department
of
peace's
responsibilities
would
be
to
coordinate
and
harness
the
powers
of
conflict
resolution
restorative
justice
violence
prevention
trauma-informed
education
mindfulness
in
the
schools
child
and
family
wrap-around
services
social
and
emotional
learning
and
a
world-class
peace
academy
to
train
and
to
deploy
thousands
of
peace-builders
plus
national
conferences
and
a
presidential
task
force
for
peace
creation
what
exactly
would
the
department
of
peace
do
to
make
these
platitudes
a
reality
williamson
did
not
offer
any
specifics
how
much
would
the
department
of
peace
cost
williamson
did
not
offer
any
cost
estimates
would
the
department
of
peace
impact
the
deficit
and
the
debt
williamson
did
not
say
whether
her
proposed
new
department
would
increase
the
annual
deficit
which
is
estimated
to
be
billion
in
and
trillion
over
the
next
years
she
also
did
not
elaborate
on
how
expanding
the
size
of
government
would
impact
the
federal
debt
which
is
currently
more
than
trillion
or
percent
of
gdp
