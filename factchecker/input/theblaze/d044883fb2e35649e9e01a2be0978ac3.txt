what
are
the
details
susan
church
an
immigration
attorney
was
handcuffed
and
remanded
to
a
jail
cell
after
she
protested
against
boston
municipal
court
judge
richard
sinnott's
decision
to
reject
prosecutors
recommendations
to
dismiss
the
disorderly
conduct
and
resisting
arrest
charges
that
were
laid
against
her
client
according
to
wbur-tv
church
was
arguing
case
law
which
supported
the
decision
to
avoid
pursuing
charges
against
the
client
church
argued
that
sinnott
didn't
have
authority
to
reject
the
prosecution's
decision
not
to
prosecute
many
of
the
counterprotesters
sinnott
told
the
courtroom
that
while
church
was
clearly
filled
with
passion
she
kept
talking
over
me
wbz-tv
reported
the
day
before
church's
arrest
sinnott
rejected
the
suffolk
county
district
attorney's
office
motions
to
drop
charges
against
many
of
the
counterprotesters
at
the
rally
after
her
arrest
church
issued
a
statement
on
the
incident
i
was
just
released
after
being
unlawfully
and
unreasonably
and
honestly
outrageously
arrested
for
simply
doing
my
job
for
advocating
for
a
client
who
the
district
attorney's
office
wanted
to
dismiss
her
charges
she
explained
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
district
attorney's
office
has
the
right
to
do
that
the
judge
objected
the
law
is
also
absolutely
clear
that
the
judge
doesn't
have
a
reject
it
all
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
read
the
law
to
the
court
and
i
was
summarily
arrested
handcuffed
brought
down
to
the
holding
cell
and
held
there
for
hours
she
said
and
revealed
concerns
that
her
arrest
could
set
a
dangerous
precedent
my
biggest
concern
is
this
doesn't
have
a
chilling
effect
for
all
the
other
lawyers
out
there
who
are
fighting
the
good
fight
and
who
are
representing
people
and
doing
their
jobs
she
added
this
was
outrageous
behavior
never
seen
anything
quite
like
this
church's
attorney
max
stern
told
reporters
that
her
arrest
was
unprecedented
she
wasn't
disruptive
at
all
and
she
was
let
out
of
the
courtroom
in
shackles
stern
said
this
is
extremely
extraordinary
never
seen
anything
quite
like
this
where
someone
is
shackled
and
taken
away
because
of
an
argument
that
she
made
