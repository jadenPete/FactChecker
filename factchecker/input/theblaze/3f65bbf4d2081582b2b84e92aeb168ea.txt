new
york
city
mayor
and
democratic
presidential
candidate
bill
de
blasio
on
monday
tweeted
his
support
for
a
bizarre
plan
to
tax
robots
and
create
a
federal
department
to
oversee
automation
in
response
to
an
article
from
wired
com
titled
why
american
workers
need
to
be
protected
from
automation
de
blasio
tweeted
as
president
i
would
issue
a
robot
tax
for
corporations
displacing
humans
and
create
a
federal
agency
to
oversee
automation
in
a
more
detailed
statement
released
on
his
website
de
blasio
claimed
that
current
automation
practices
are
an
existential
threat
to
our
nation's
workforce
that
destroys
good
jobs
and
directs
more
and
more
of
the
profits
only
to
the
wealthiest
americans
in
response
to
this
alleged
threat
de
blasio
proposes
to
create
a
new
federal
agency
the
federal
automation
and
worker
protection
agency
fawpa
which
would
have
broad
authority
to
regulate
the
widespread
growth
of
automation
and
oversee
its
impact
on
working
people
specifically
the
plan
states
any
major
company
seeking
to
increase
automated
operations
would
be
required
to
seek
a
permit
from
fawpa
with
approval
conditioned
on
the
company's
plans
to
protect
existing
workers
either
by
ensuring
they
receive
new
jobs
with
similar
pay
or
severance
packages
that
reflect
their
tenure
of
service
to
the
company
in
true
de
blasio
fashion
the
plan
would
also
feature
numerous
tax
increases
including
the
end
of
the
corporate
accelerated
depreciation
tax
break
and
the
institution
of
an
actual
robot
tax
which
de
blasio
claims
would
require
corporations
who
eliminate
jobs
via
automation
to
pay
the
equivalent
of
five
years
worth
of
payroll
taxes
up
front
for
each
worker
whose
job
is
eliminated
under
de
blasio's
plan
the
revenues
from
these
taxes
would
facilitate
the
creation
of
new
high-paying
union
jobs
in
crucial
fields
such
as
green
energy
health
care
and
early
childhood
education
workers
displaced
by
automation
would
go
to
the
front
of
the
line
for
these
new
positions
at
comparable
salaries
to
their
previous
jobs
the
plan
does
not
specify
how
one
lump
sum
payment
of
five
years
worth
of
payroll
tax
would
create
a
new
sustainable
high-paying
union
job
for
that
worker
but
presumably
some
unicorn
dust
is
involved
somehow
for
reference
the
current
amount
of
payroll
tax
collected
for
a
worker
who
makes
in
salary
is
per
year
which
means
that
five
years
worth
of
that
tax
would
amount
to
or
less
than
one
third
of
what
it
would
cost
to
employ
that
worker
for
a
single
year
so
de
blasio's
plan
would
provide
enough
revenue
to
give
a
displaced
worker
a
job
for
a
whopping
three
months
of
course
de
blasio's
plan
also
does
not
address
or
mention
the
fact
that
human
labor
has
been
increasingly
automated
at
an
accelerating
pace
since
the
dawn
of
the
industrial
age
which
has
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
entire
fields
of
labor
like
elevator
operators
gas
station
attendants
except
in
new
jersey
where
a
bizarre
law
has
kept
this
anachronistic
and
completely
unnecessary
menial
job
alive
and
the
like
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
threat
of
automation
unemployment
continues
to
trend
steadily
downward
to
its
current
historically
low
levels
which
suggests
that
the
market
is
doing
a
fine
job
of
replacing
jobs
that
can
be
performed
by
automated
processes
with
jobs
that
are
required
in
the
new
economy
without
the
creation
of
an
intrusive
federal
agency
or
the
imposition
of
new
taxes
that
will
be
used
to
line
the
pockets
of
unions
make
american
corporations
less
efficient
and
competitive
and
keep
people
trapped
doing
manual
labor
that
is
completely
unnecessary
