is
president
trump
building
the
next
political
dynasty
his
campaign
manager
sure
thinks
so
i
just
think
they
are
a
dynasty
will
president
donald
trump's
family
be
the
next
great
political
dynasty
brad
parscale
trump's
campaign
manager
believes
the
answer
to
that
question
in
an
unequivocal
yes
parscale
speaking
to
republican
party
delegates
in
indian
wells
california
on
saturday
predicted
the
trumps
will
be
a
mainstay
in
american
politics
for
decades
to
come
the
trumps
will
be
a
dynasty
that
will
last
for
decades
propelling
the
republican
party
into
a
new
party
one
that
will
adapt
to
changing
cultures
he
said
according
to
the
associated
press
one
must
continue
to
adapt
while
keeping
the
conservative
values
that
we
believe
in
he
later
told
reporters
i
just
think
they
are
a
dynasty
i
think
they
are
all
amazing
people
with
amazing
capabilities
parscale's
comments
immediately
generated
questions
of
whether
trump's
children
eldest
son
don
jr
eric
who
currently
manages
the
trump
organization
and
eldest
daughter
ivanka
and
her
husband
jared
kushner
both
senior
advisers
to
the
president
are
planning
political
futures
parscale
refused
to
address
those
questions
instead
a
campaign
official
told
the
new
york
times
that
parscale
was
not
necessarily
implying
trump's
children
are
planning
to
run
for
office
but
that
they
are
exceptional
at
campaigning
and
fundraising
crucial
skills
necessary
for
political
success
so
the
question
stands
will
trump's
children
run
for
political
office
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
yet
answerable
but
it
is
clear
that
trump
jr
and
ivanka
have
some
form
of
political
aspirations
trump
jr
spent
months
on
the
campaign
trail
last
year
barnstorming
for
republicans
and
speaking
with
voters
while
ivanka
has
maintained
a
sizable
presence
in
the
west
wing
indeed
a
new
expos
in
the
atlantic
explored
the
inner-family
battle
to
grapple
for
power
as
trump
nears
his
reelection
fight
according
to
the
story
trump
jr
is
best
poised
to
follow
in
his
father's
footsteps
despite
trump
grooming
and
allegedly
favoring
ivanka
