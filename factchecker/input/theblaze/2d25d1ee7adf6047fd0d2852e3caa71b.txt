in
years
democratic
presidential
candidate
sen
bernie
sanders
vt
released
a
climate
change
plan
thursday
that
far
exceeds
the
plans
of
other
democrats
in
both
ambition
and
cost
according
to
the
new
york
times
sanders
who
supported
the
infamous
green
new
deal
posted
by
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
gave
his
plan
the
same
title
and
wants
to
eliminate
fossil
fuel
use
completely
by
the
sanders
plan
carries
a
price
tag
of
trillion
including
billion
committed
to
assisting
poor
nations
in
dealing
with
climate
change
and
its
impacts
to
show
just
how
much
pricier
sanders
plan
is
than
those
of
his
fellow
democratic
candidates
joe
biden's
climate
plan
requires
trillion
over
years
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
mass
proposed
a
trillion
plan
the
ambitious
plan
could
be
an
attempt
by
sanders
to
position
himself
as
the
top
climate
change
candidate
in
the
democratic
primary
after
gov
jay
inslee
of
washington
ended
his
climate
change-focused
bid
this
week
president
trump
thinks
that
climate
change
is
a
hoax
sanders
said
president
trump
is
dangerously
dangerously
wrong
climate
change
is
an
existential
threat
to
the
entire
country
and
the
entire
world
and
we
must
be
extraordinarily
aggressive
i
have
seven
grandchildren
and
i'm
going
to
be
damned
if
i'm
going
to
leave
them
a
planet
that
is
unhealthy
and
uninhabitable
sanders
said
his
plan
will
pay
for
itself
in
years
by
imposing
fees
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
and
eliminating
subsidies
scaling
back
military
spending
and
increasing
tax
revenue
through
new
renewable
energy
jobs
sanders
claimed
that
the
plan
would
create
million
jobs
under
his
plan
climate
change
would
be
declared
a
national
emergency
and
there
would
be
a
heavy
investment
in
new
solar
wind
and
geothermal
power
sources
nationwide
sanders
plan
does
not
embrace
nuclear
energy
instead
calling
for
a
moratorium
on
nuclear
power
plant
license
renewals
and
referring
to
nuclear
energy
as
a
false
solution
for
some
that
undermines
the
value
of
the
plan
the
sanders
plan
appears
to
be
big
but
it's
not
serious
said
joshua
freed
vice
president
for
clean
energy
at
third
way
a
democratic
think
tank
we
need
to
have
every
option
on
the
table
