the
decision
an
alabama
high
school
has
removed
bathroom
stall
doors
as
a
brand-new
approach
to
crack
down
on
teens
vaping
in
bathrooms
what
are
the
details
according
to
waff-tv
administrators
at
wilson
high
school
in
florence
alabama
removed
some
of
the
bathroom
stall
doors
in
the
men's
restrooms
principal
gary
horton
said
one

passed
out
in
a
stall
last
week
after
vaping
adding
that
the
vaping
epidemic
in
the
school
has
gotten
out
of
control
wavy-tv
reported
that
the
solution
according
to
the
principal
may
be
temporary
until

can
figure
out
a
more
permanent
way
to
combat
vaping
some
parents
aren't
on
board
with
the
decision
parent
rachel
munsey
told
waff
i
don't
like
it
they
take
their
only
private
place
in
the
school
that
they
can
do
their
business

campbell
another
parent
said
that
other
measures
could
be
taken
to
stop
kids
from
vaping
in
school
bathrooms
maybe
they
need
to
put
a
monitor
in
the
hall
he
suggested
usually
they
have
a
truancy
officer
or
a
police
officer
at
the
school
have
them
monitor
the
hallway
because
a
bathroom
is
for
each
individual
person's
privacy

else
the
school's
decision
comes
on
the
heels
of
the
centers

at
least
three
people
have
died
in

have
been
prompted
by

use
health
officials
also
reported
that
more
than

a
statement
from
