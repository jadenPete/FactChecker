and
vandalism
for
rejecting
transgender

they
say
someone
also
nailed
a
dead
rat
to
their
door
as
a
warning
canada's
oldest
rape
crisis
shelter
is
facing
death
threats
and
vandalism
over
their
policy
of
not
including
transgender
women
the
vancouver
rape
relief
and
women's
shelter
vrrws
posted
photos
of
the
vandalism
on
their
social
media
account
a
follow
up
to
the
dead
rat
that
was
nailed
to
our
door
recently
this
morning
we
found
this
writing
scrawled
across
the
windows
of
our
storefront
space
that
we
use
for
support
and
training
groups
the
account
tweeted
adding
misogyny
in
a
hashtag
the
photos
show
writing
with
the
death
threat
kill
terfs
and
trans
power
the
word
terf
is
an
acronym
used
by
transgender
activists
and
allies
as
a
pejorative
for
transgender
exclusionary
radical
feminist
it
is
used
against
feminists
who
do
not
follow
the
demands
of
the
transgender
lobby
especially
those
which
put
women
at
risk
or
under
threat
a
spokeswoman
for
the
center
spoke
to
madeleine
kearns
of
national
review
and
drew
a
distinction
between
the
threats
made
against
the
clinic
and
the
very
real
abuse
that
had
been
suffered
by
the
women
they
serve
we
deal
with
real
violence
and
physical
violence
so
i
don't
want
to
blur
the
real
threat
on
women's
lives
and
real
dangers
to
women's
safety
with
abusive
and
intimidating
language
said
hilla
kerner
this
is
not
the
same
level
of
threatened
violence
she
concluded
the
center
offers
its
services
to
women
who
were
born
female
in
accordance
with
the
feminism
that
guides
their
mission
in
march
the
vancouver
city
council
pulled
funding
from
the
group
because
of
pressure
from
transgender
activists
the
shelter
decried
the
decision
saying
in
a
statement
that
the
council
was
committing
to
discrimination
against
women
in
the
name
of
inclusion
vancouver
city
council's
decision
is
intended
to
coerce
us
to
change
our
position
and
practice
of
offering
some
of
our
core
services
only
to
women
who
are
born
female
they
added
here's
a
local
news
report
about
the
feud
