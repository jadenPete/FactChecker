august
jobs
report
reveals
impact
chinese
tariffs
are
having
on
economic
growth
the
numbers
did
not
meet
expectations
the
august
jobs
report
from
the
labor
department
showed
that
growth
underperformed
expectations
indicating
that
the
trade
war
with
china
and
the
resulting
tariffs
are
negatively
impacting
some
industries
while
the
unemployment
rate
remained
low
at
percent
and
overall
labor
force
participation
rose
to
percent
the
economy
only
added
jobs
well
below
the
that
was
widely
projected
of
those
only
were
in
the
private
sector
and
of
the
new
workers
were
temporary
positions
hired
to
conduct
the
census
the
labor
department's
numbers
are
particularly
disappointing
when
contrasted
with
an
adp
research
institute
projection
from
thursday
that
claimed
the
economy
had
added
private
sector
jobs
apparently
leading
president
donald
trump
to
tweet
about
really
good
job
numbers
revisions
to
previous
months
jobs
numbers
dragged
the
year's
monthly
average
down
even
further
june's
growth
was
revised
down
by
jobs
and
july's
was
revised
down
by
s
monthly
job
increase
average
is
new
jobs
per
month
in
the
average
monthly
gain
was
per
month
growth
is
particularly
slow
or
nonexistent
in
the
construction
transportation
manufacturing
and
warehousing
industries
which
some
analysts
attribute
partially
to
the
trade
war
with
china
chinese
tariffs
on
american
goods
have
hurt
u.s.
exports
and
businesses
are
hesitant
to
spend
invest
and
expand
given
uncertainty
about
how
long
the
trade
war
will
continue
the
news
is
not
all
bad
however
unemployment
remains
at
record
lows
average
hourly
pay
is
up
from
a
year
ago
and
consumer
spending
was
up
from
april
through
june
president
trump
blames
the
federal
reserve
for
slowing
economic
growth
and
slammed
the
fed
chair
jerome
powell
a
trump
appointee
on
twitter
i
agree
with
jimcramer
the
fed
should
lower
rates
trump
wrote
they
were
way
too
early
to
raise
and
way
too
late
to
cut
and
big
dose
quantitative
tightening
didn't
exactly
help
either
where
did
i
find
this
guy
jerome
oh
well
you
can't
win
them
all
