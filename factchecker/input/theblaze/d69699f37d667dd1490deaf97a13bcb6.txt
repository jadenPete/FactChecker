antifa
punk
tries
blocking
big

wearing

trust
shirt
at
protest
and
pays
for
it
the
antifa
faithful
were
out
in
force
over
the
weekend
in
portland
oregon
in
what
was
apparently
called
a
stand
against
police
targeting
rally
so
a
group
calling
itself
patriot
prayer
organized
an
antifa
watch
on
saturday
to
make
sure
protesters
didn't
break
laws
or
block
traffic
which
has
been
an
issue
in
portland
since
the
election
of
republican
president
donald
trump
all
are
welcome
to
join
but
please
do
not
come
if
you
can
not
control
your
temper
the
patriot
prayer
message
on
facebook
said
this
is
not
a
rally
or
a
march
but
when
the
groups
converged
in
chapman
square
emotions
were
running
high
as
a
video
camera
rolled
a
woman
wearing
sunglasses
seemingly
leading
the
antifas
accused
patriot
prayer
members
of
invading
their
space
a
bearded
guy
in
a
dark
leather
jacket
apparently
with
patriot
prayer
promised
violence
if
the
antifas
made
threats

things
seemed
as
though
they'd
be
limited
to
a
war
of
words
that
is
until
a
rather
large
fellow
with
a
mohawk
and
a
yellow
t-shirt
emblazoned
with
in
god
we
trust
on
the
back
tried
to
walk
past
the
antifas

suddenly
a
far
less
imposing
long-haired
guy
apparently
in
ranks
with
the
antifas
figured
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
try
blocking
the
big
guy's
path

um
no
his
path
momentarily
thwarted
the
big
guy
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
socked
the
long-haired
dude
with
a
quick
left
and
down
he
went

don't
f
in
touch
me
the
big
guy
yelled
pointing
at
his
fallen
opponent
that
set
off
the
antifa
faithful
who
began
screaming
at
the
patriot
prayer
members
and
putting
up
their
hands
as
if
ready
for
combat

and
as
it
happens
one
of
them
apparently
was
prepared
for
such
a
moment
a
masked
black-clad
woman
carrying
a
baseball
bat

but
the
antifas
began
to
retreat
when
a
patriot
prayer
member
got
on
the
phone
with
police
and
described
the
woman
carrying
the
bat
later
adding
she
had
a
knife
an
antifa
woman
with
bright
pink
hair
tried
telling
the
man
talking
with
cops
that
we're
trying
to
deescalate

another
guy
apparently
an
antifa
supporter
told
the
patriot
prayer
group
to
just
back
off
y'all
don't
need
this
nonsense
and
added
they
took
the
baseball
bat
out
of
play
amazing
how
quickly
things
can
calm
down
