just
a

wants
to
connect
joe
biden
strolled
into
the
cramped
room
and
everybody
got
quiet
even
the
beer-bellied
man
in
the
t-shirt
that
said
my
dog
is
smarter
than
the
president
an
interesting
apparel
choice
given
the
setting
a
local
plumbers
and
steamfitters
union
that
doubled
as
a
training
center
around
the
corner
gray's
lake
and
jasper
winery
biden's
thursday
night
town
hall
was
organized
by
the
iowa
asian
and
latino
coalition
ialc
open
only
to
members
but
anyone
could
pay
a
fee
or
so
and
join
the
union
for
admittance
a
group
of
six
somethings
in
rolled-up
jeans
and
woke-slogan
t-shirts
shuddered
at
the
price
of
entry
and
backed
out
of
the
room
with
their
eyebrows
cocked
also
there
was
an
actual
dog
in
the
room
a
french
bulldog
which
did
not
appear
to
belong
to
the
dog
t-shirt
man
but
there
was
no
telling
with
that
crowd
some
of
them
were
more
biden
than
biden
himself
like
the
guy
in
an
oversized
button-up
with
embroidered
parrots
along
the
shoulder
the
way
he
nibbled
on
the
same
croissant
for
at
least
minutes
did
he
eat
everything
like
that
like
he'd
been
instructed
how
to
chew
by
npr
or
the
middle-aged
woman
in
the
lion-themed
blouse
with
psychedelic
designs
she
yipped
whenever
she
felt
the
urge
sang
out
with
answers
or
praise
any
time
she
liked
what
biden
had
said
several
times
she
crabbed
out
of
the
room
shoving
and
groaning
then
when
she
returned
all
you
could
smell
was
booze
and
the
drunker
she
got
the
more
impressed
she
was
with
her
observations
at
one
point
this
lady
was
within
arm's
length
of
joe
biden
which
was
as
dumbfounding
as
it
was
cool
or
horrific
folks
this
is
wrong
biden
would
say
it
was
a
phrase
he
used
as
punctuation
the
room
was
about
half
the
size
of
a
basketball
court
maybe
smaller
it
felt
like
a
sweat
lodge
the
lights
and
cameras
and
laptops
and
people
made
it
degrees
warmer
the
media
swarmed
at
the
back
of
the
room
encroaching
into
the
crowd
of
serious
people
in
grey
folding
chairs
a
row
of
video
cameras
like
robotic
creatures
all
spindle
and
wire
behind
the
videographers
journalists
with
laptops
perched
at
a
long
wooden
table
the
measured
clack
clack
clack
clack
slump
clack
of
furious
typing
paper
plates
with
finger
foods
stacked
wherever
there
was
space
the
photographers
had
the
most
freedom
they
could
wander
around
snapping
photos
like
it
was
their
birthday
and
this
was
their
party
which
is
not
how
they
acted
the
opposite
they
climbed
around
the
room
with
the
intensity
and
skill
of
a
navy
seal
in
a
swamp
they
got
as
close
as
they
could
before
someone
usually
a
body
guard
or
a
secret
service
agent
told
them
to
back
off
nearly
half
of
the
audience
were
media
there
wasn't
an
empty
seat
in
the
room
but
it
still
felt
odd
as
if
the
media
had
taken
up
space
that
could've
been
used
by
say
a
group
of
somethings
without
enough
cash
to
see
the
former
vice
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
speaking
to
a
room
full
of
local
politicians
and
plumbers
as
cnn
and
abc
and
foxnews
filmed
it
all
in
reality
the
media
were
there
partly
as
stand-ins
for
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
americans
of
people
throughout
the
world
who
couldn't
make
it
to
the
union
hall
in
iowa
as
joe
biden
writhed
into
another
cringy
mistake
biden's
campaign
had
spent
money
on
perfecting
optics
at
every
speech
he
spoke
into
a
brand
new
pa
system
facing
spotlights
like
you'd
see
in
a
theater
all
of
the
candidates
knew
how
to
plaster
any
given
room
with
their
campaign
signs
biden
and
kamala
harris
understood
the
deeper
game
the
optics
bernie
sanders
likely
did
as
well
but
chose
not
to
play
it
which
is
to
say
that
biden
looked
great
better
than
he
looks
in
the
second
clip
of
the
event
the
clip
that
went
viral
the
second
hiccup
of
his
two
hour
talk
the
gaffe
quite
possibly
a
deadly
moment
in
his
campaign
the
other
thing
we
should
do
is
we
should
challenge
these
students
he
said
firm
and
smooth
we
should
challenge
students
in
these
schools
to
have
advanced
placement
programs
in
these
schools
we
have
this
notion
that
somehow
if
you're
poor
you
cannot
do
it
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
concluded
poor
kids
are
just
as
bright
and
just
as
talented
as
white
kids
a
chatter
of
applause
because
everybody
knew
what
he
meant
that
this
was
uncle
joe
fumbling
his
words
again
and
that
was
pretty
much
the
end
of
it
the
new
yorker
framed
the
scene
with
a
touch
of
the
dramatic
there
were
groans
in
the
room
and
a
smattering
of
hesitant
applause
biden
definitely
botched
the
landing
but
he
followed
up
quickly
wealthy
people
he
said
black
kids
asian
kids
the
next
day
the
media
leapt
on
biden
naturally
president
trump
took
the
opportunity
to
throw
some
shade
he
told
reporters
that
joe
biden
is
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
this
is
not
somebody
you
can
have
as
your
president
in
a
bizarre
moment
of
unity
the
media
and
president
trump
agreed
though
for
much
different
reasons
biden
may
never
outlive
it
poor
kids
are
just
as
bright
and
just
as
talented
as
white
kids
at
the
presidential
gun
forum
a
few
days
later
biden
will
say
look
i
misspoke
i
meant
to
say
wealthy
i've
said
it
times
on
the
spot
i
explained
it
at
that
very
second
i
explained
it
and
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
don't
think
anybody
thinks
that
i
meant
anything
other
than
what
i
said
i
meant
for
the
past
three
years
president
trump
has
been
the
media's
focus
unrelenting
he's
the
giant
prize
at
the
arcade
and
they're
pre-teens
with
leftover
money
desperate
to
own
that
giant
orange
panda
when's
the
last
time
you
heard
a
positive
remark
about
president
trump
from
any
mainstream
media
besides
fox
news
now
president
trump
doesn't
seem
to
mind
not
publicly
at
least
because
he
has
always
played
the
media
during
the
election
the
media
lavished
him
with
free
advertising
he
didn't
even
have
a
campaign
website
why
bother
when
the
new
york
times
does
the
broadcasting
and
recruitment
for
you
maybe
biden
lacked
this
acuity
this
bull
energy
and
that's
why
he
never
recovered
as
well
as
he
messed
up
or
maybe
biden
played
the
course
as
it
was
meant
to
be
played
it
wasn't
time
to
activate
the
boosters
too
early
just
maintain
a
steady
pace
hone
the
routine
and
show
your
face
to
americans
because
that's
where
biden
excelled
all
the
same
there's
hypocrisy
to
biden's
constant
attack
of
president
trump
if
you're
going
to
paint
someone
as
a
lying
soulless
brainless
misogynistic
racist
you
better
make
sure
that
your
room
is
clean
that
your
life
your
language
and
your
presentation
are
spic-and-span
otherwise
you
lose
and
at
the
moment
biden
was
losing
he
would
be
in
two
months
he
had
lost
a
son
to
brain
cancer
and
when
he
was
his
wife
and
daughter
died
in
a
car
wreck
he's
had
private
dinners
and
intimate
conversations
with
the
most
powerful
people
on
earth
correction
he
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
people
on
earth
when
then-president
barack
obama
draped
the
medal
of
freedom
around
biden's
neck
he
cried
but
always
the
gaffes
even
as
vice
president
he
was
the
butt
of
many
jokes
however
well-meaning
like
the
onion's
satirical
take
on
biden
diamond
joe
for
the
first
half
of
the
country
mocked
him
depicted
him
as
a
creep
turned
him
into
a
meme
all
because
he
was
old-school
with
his
body
language
and
affection
you
can
find
the
montage
online
for
years
biden
used
physical
touch
to
break
through
the
barriers
and
restraints
of
conversation
on
an
impossible
schedule
how
do
you
make
a
meaningful
connection
with
a
stranger
or
a
roomful
of
strangers
when
you
have
very
little
time
and
he
had
been
affable
joe
biden
for
decades
without
a
single
issue
the
times
had
changed
the
latest
generation
was
touchy
about
personal
space
according
to
the
focus
groups
and
surveys
despite
the
outrage
biden
didn't
apologize
but
he
acknowledged
the
issue
i
will
be
more
mindful
about
respecting
personal
space
in
the
future
he
said
in
a
video
that's
my
responsibility
and
i
will
meet
it
i
think
most
people
believed
him
agreed
that
he's
not
a
predator
maybe
he's
the
guy
who
constantly
tries
to
give
everyone
neck
massages
because
he
thinks
he's
good
at
it
but
really
he's
just
knotting
people
up
and
violating
their
space
sometimes
a
person
just
needs
to
be
told
when
they've
become
intrusive
or
else
they
might
never
realize
or
maybe
biden
is
neither
not
a
creep
or
a
doofus
but
a
man
who
wants
to
connect
a
man
who
wants
the
oval
office
for
real
this
time
as
biden's
campaign
built
steam
the
creepy
joe
story
slowly
vanished
in
its
place
articles
about
biden's
gaffes
became
more
prominent
and
now
of
his
fellow
democrats
were
hoping
for
his
downfall
he
was
christened
sleepy
joe
by
president
trump
who
scoffed
that
biden
was
too
old
for
the
job
tongue-in-cheek
referring
to
himself
as
a
young
vibrant
man
from
the
start
everyone
attacked
biden
because
he
was
in
the
lead
because
he
was
probably
the
most
qualified
so
he
had
to
just
take
it
with
dignity
if
possible
did
he
ever
get
tired
of
all
the
commotion
his
obsessive
word
that
night
was
solitary
as
in
every
single
solitary
child
earlier
that
day
it
had
rained
poured
down
onto
people
at
the
iowa
state
fair
it
must
have
soaked
every
single
solitary
person
to
add
to
it
all
biden
has
struggled
in
iowa
before
when
he
ran
for
president
in
he
ended
his
campaign
after
plagiarizing
a
neil
kinnock
speech
at
a
democratic
debate
at
the
iowa
state
fair
as
is
usually
the
case
with
biden
the
whole
thing
seems
to
have
been
a
misunderstanding
around
that
time
he
fibbed
about
his
law
school
grades
or
something
like
that
middle
class
joe
with
his
tall
tales
and
lofty
aspirations
isn't
that
the
ultimate
middle
class
joe
move
it's
like
how
iowa
has
the
highest
per
capita
number
of
golf
courses
in
the
country
and
in
actor
rob
lowe
whacked
a
golf
ball
and
it
catapulted
up
and
hit
a
goldfinch
mid-flight
his
first
round
of
golf
in
iowa
as
part
of
a
pga
pro-am
celebrity
tournament
and
he
killed
the
state
bird
that's
an
uncle
joe
move
democracy
fails
without
journalism
mass
media
connect
us
to
reality
journalists
hold
this
incredible
power
the
power
to
utterly
ruin
someone
who
maybe
doesn't
deserve
ruin
or
lionize
someone
who
should
be
leeching
in
obscurity
this
ultimatum
hung
in
the
air
as
biden
spoke
clumsy
like
he
hadn't
slept
well
in
weeks
maybe
longer
which
is
probably
the
reality
he'd
already
botched
the
speech
he
knew
it
likely
with
no
forgiveness
from
the
media
ideally
politicians
and
journalists
are
like
sharks
and
pilot
fish
the
sharks
don't
devour
the
pilot
fish
and
in
turn
the
pilot
fish
eat
the
shark's
parasites
politicians
need
journalists
in
order
to
spread
their
message
to
impact
public
opinion
and
journalists
depend
on
politicians
for
protection
in
a
business
sense
and
for
access
people
want
to
watch
sharks
be
shark-like
pilot
fish
keep
them
alive
and
save
their
own
scales
in
the
process
i
bet
you're
wondering
so
who
are
the
parasites
in
this
metaphor
biden
had
class
that's
for
sure
despite
his
goofs
he
had
an
air
of
diplomacy
the
presence
of
someone
who
for
eight
years
had
classified
material
delivered
to
him
like
the
morning
paper
he
has
seen
the
innermost
workings
of
the
world's
governments
he
was
one
of
the
dozen-or-so
people
who
watched
the
live
feed
of
osama
bin
laden's
assassination
an
occasion
captured
by
that
gripping
now-iconic
photo
of
biden
obama
and
the
national
security
team
in
the
situation
room
by
this
point
after
decades
in
politics
he
looks
good
as
a
matter
of
habit
he
wears
sharp
deep-blue
suits
like
the
rest
of
us
wear
a
t-shirt
and
khakis
in
iowa
he
exuded
prestige
and
wisdom
when
he
spoke
even
when
he
misspoke
people
listened
and
he
looked
you
in
the
eye
with
an
avuncular
kindness
then
he
fumbled
a
few
words
or
stumbled
into
some
bad
optics
and
the
media
went
full
shark
on
him
they
went
shark
on
him
the
shark
which
too
often
felt
contrived
most
of
the
time
you
could
tell
what
biden
meant
to
say
although
yes
if
you
have
a
habit
of
bungling
your
words
then
don't
center
your
speech
on
the
idea
that
a
president's
words
matter
so
in
the
presidential
election
vote
for
me
the
habitual
word-bungler
all
week
flags
were
at
half-mast
two
shootings
within
hours
of
each
other
and
we
the
whole
country
all
slumped
around
with
a
devastation
so
i
had
expected
every
democratic
candidate
to
talk
about
guns
that
morning
on
the
back
of
the
des
moines
register
a
full
page
in
red
font
was
devoted
to
the
presidential
gun
sense
forum
being
held
in
two
days
at
the
iowa
events
center
where
all
of
the
candidates
would
give
a
speech
at
an
appointed
time
if
the
iowa
star
fair
had
opened
during
the
previous
news
cycle
the
candidates
would
likely
fume
about
immigration
or
israel
and
they
all
hated
president
trump
or
pretended
to
with
a
ferocity
usually
reserved
for
cockroaches
and
murder
just
that
morning
elizabeth
warren
flagged
down
a
journalist
to
say
for
the
record
donald
trump
is
a
white
supremacist
and
the
rest
of
them
shouted
in
accord
they're
politicians
like
male
frogs
when
one
of
them
ribbits
loudly
and
a
female
frog
responds
the
other
male
frogs
do
their
best
imitation
it's
a
real-life
game
of
language
poker
bluff
wince
suppress
speak
listen
react
do
anything
and
everything
to
win
win
win
so
they
had
to
talk
about
gun
control
and
white
supremacy
in
order
to
keep
playing
they
had
to
reference
the
primary
topics
of
discussion
for
august
but
in
a
way
that
revealed
authenticity
without
seeming
gullible
it's
a
matter
of
knowing
what
to
say
always
which
is
an
insane
expectation
for
so
many
reasons
because
the
clarion
call
is
different
by
the
day
certainly
by
the
month
depending
how
fervidly
the
media
push
it
good
news
is
research
shows
that
people
aren't
so
gullible
we
typically
distrust
the
media
because
public
opinion
doesn't
always
line
up
with
the
media
message
if
americans
don't
like
the
narrative
being
hammered
down
their
throats
they'll
shrug
and
change
the
channel
move
on
stop
caring
like
bill
clinton's
impeachment
the
media
wanted
an
opera
but
most
of
the
country
just
didn't
give
a
damn
what
the
man
did
behind
closed
doors
even
if
they
were
the
doors
to
the
oval
office
the
reason
i
call
him
barack
biden
said
somewhat
randomly
is
because
i
don't
want
to
confuse
him
with
the
president
soft
spoken
gentle
voiced
earlier
he
compared
trump
to
hitler
hitler
leader
of
the
nazis
genocidal
maniac
full-blown
hellaciously
prolific
psychopath
an
honest-to-god
dictator
who
murdered
and
tortured
millions
of
jews
trump
on
the
other
hand
is
the
first
president
to
recognize
jerusalem
as
the
capital
of
israel
but
just
happens
to
be
well
kind
of
an
ass
nobody
denies
that
many
people
even
happen
to
admire
it
but
hitler
hyperbole
is
fine
but
it
becomes
dangerous
when
exaggerations
mutate
into
something
uglier
it
was
like
the
democrats
were
trying
to
psyche
themselves
up
to
fight
the
class
bully
or
better
yet
the
most
popular
kid
in
school
can
you
blame
them
for
having
shaky
nerves
the
man
is
a
pulverizer
we
all
saw
what
he
did
to
the
entire
stage
of
republicans
in
he
destroyed
ivy
league-educated
lawyers
and
seasoned
politicians
legacy
politicians
american
royalty
poor
jeb
bush
probably
still
has
a
stammer
trump
ruined
careers
by
giving
out
nicknames
he
went
toe-to-toe
with
hillary
clinton
a
woman
with
a
reputation
for
getting
everything
she
wants
no
matter
the
cost
for
being
an
impenetrable
force
that
frightens
many
people
for
having
spent
eight
years
in
the
white
house
as
the
first
lady
and
even
she
lost
i'd
be
shaky
if
i
were
them
too
any
of
us
would
but
every
day
it's
a
more
serious
accusation
yet
another
barb
directed
at
president
trump
which
oddly
just
becomes
further
proof
of
president
trump's
ubiquity
every
insult
levied
at
him
just
bounces
off
his
orange
teflon
skin
like
a
jelly
bean
and
next
thing
you
know
you've
got
sugar
stains
on
your
forehead
as
biden's
speech
entered
its
second
lap
the
journalists
in
the
back
of
the
room
just
seemed
bored
how
long
had
biden
been
talking
earlier
that
day
at
the
iowa
state
fair
he
performed
better
although
he
got
a
tad
weird
in
the
press
scrum
afterward
and
shouted
it
out
with
a
reporter
from
breitbart
the
drunk
lady
in
the
trippy
lion
blouse
kept
chirping
along
with
biden
adding
a
weird
dominant
energy
to
a
room
that
already
had
a
weird
energy
of
its
own
and
by
then
even
the
kids
could
tell
the
woman
was
wasted
what
a
time
to
get
hammered
during
a
town
hall
at
a
plumbers
union
in
iowa
on
a
thursday
night
in
front
of
all
of
these
people
in
front
of
a
man
who
once
had
his
own
customized
aka
air
force
the
dog-shirt
man
gawked
at
biden
as
he
strolled
around
the
tiny
island
of
space
between
the
tables
the
dog-shirt
man
was
a
clumsy
lad
several
times
his
arms
windmilled
around
as
he
balanced
the
room
syncopated
to
his
clumsiness
more
out
of
obligation
than
respect
parrot
shirt
guy
had
finished
his
baguette
at
some
point
and
moved
onto
some
other
task
i
do
not
know
what
he
was
doing
with
his
face
and
with
his
presence
i
am
at
a
loss
of
words
alien
is
the
best
word
i
can
come
up
with
he
whispered
with
the
lop-sidedness
of
a
sinking
boat
far
too
loudly
somehow
but
in
america
we
can
eat
our
baguettes
as
slowly
as
we
please
we
can
paunch
ourselves
into
corner-store
t-shirts
then
go
to
a
formal
event
we
can
get
nice
and
revved
up
on
wine
or
vodka
or
whatever
else
we
please
within
reason
best
of
all
we
can
do
these
things
in
the
presence
of
a
former
vice
president
i've
never
been
more
optimistic
about
america
than
i
am
today
he
said
then
he
spiraled
into
an
elaborate
story
about
chinese
president
xi
jinping
how
during
one
of
biden's
visits
to
china
as
the
two
men
ate
dinner
jinping
asked
biden
to
define
america
one
word
said
biden
possibilities
now
that
woke
everyone
up
how
could
you
not
admire
a
line
as
good
as
that
line
the
q
a
went
as
well
as
a
q
a
can
the
people
with
pre-written
questions
were
nervous
like
this
was
an
audition
the
first
question
came
from
an
off-duty
sheriff
and
he
said
hi
i'm
a
sheriff
without
a
pause
biden
said
didn't
do
it
leaning
into
the
microphone
and
it
was
great
maybe
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
everybody
else
but
it
just
felt
so
playful
and
innocent
then
somebody
asked
about
the
democratic
debates
i
won't
call
them
debates
he
said
i'll
call
them
one-minute
assertions
another
good
ad-libbed
line
where
was
this
delivery
during
his
speeches
biden
has
shotguns
he
told
the
sheriff
then
veered
into
a
tangent
that
journalists
have
characterized
as
near-senile
to
me
it
was
charming
it
was
him
saying
look
we're
spending
this
time
together
so
how
about
i
open
up
and
let
you
see
who
i
am
or
at
least
who
he
wanted
to
portray
the
moderator
quipped
that
could
biden
be
a
little
more
succinct
with
his
answers
a
joke
everyone
laughed
then
we
all
moved
on
outside
the
sun
was
still
as
red
and
orange
as
usually
is
before
evening
we
were
nearing
the
sanguine
moment
when
day
changes
hands
with
night
a
cool
dampness
skipped
the
air
degrees
in
august
and
a
low
of
what
was
this
place
iowa
exudes
an
american
rawness
in
manner
and
spirit
its
state
colors
are
red
white
and
blue
its
flower
is
the
wild
rose
it's
motto
is
our
liberties
we
prize
and
our
rights
we
will
maintain
it
is
the
birthplace
of
john
wayne
home
to
the
crimson-painted
bridges
of
a
fictional
madison
county
it
is
heart-breaking
how
american
iowa
is
the
vintage
america
with
the
worst
cellphone
reception
i've
ever
encountered
and
amish-run
gas
stations
that
don't
have
credit
card
slots
on
the
pumps
and
everywhere
a
slower
pace
as
if
social
media
never
happened
on
the
lawn
of
the
plumber's
union
a
statue
of
two
hands
clenching
pipe
wrenches
and
fastening
a
socket
in
front
of
it
a
plaque
titled
pulling
together
which
noted
this
piece
of
art
is
not
only
about
unions
it
is
about
the
human
condition
the
american
flag
by
the
entrance
had
been
raised
to
its
peak
possibly
that
day
most
other
places
still
had
their
flags
at
half-mast
there
was
something
triumphant
about
returning
the
flag
to
its
proper
height
it
was
by
no
means
a
slight
against
the
recent
shootings
if
anything
it
was
a
way
of
redistributing
power
a
red
suv
waited
by
the
rear
door
next
to
a
white
van
my
guess
was
that
this
was
the
subtle
way
that
biden
traveled
endurance
meanwhile
kamala
harris
had
her
own
fleet
with
her
name
in
purple
and
yellow
down
the
side
we've
yet
to
see
if
hers
might
have
been
the
better
approach
it
was
getting
late
and
biden
was
still
yammering
and
we
had
places
to
be
as
my
dad
and
i
tiptoed
out
the
french
bulldog
snorted
around
the
room
you
could
hear
him
chuff
and
he
hustled
toward
the
kids
slumping
against
the
walls
he
jumped
away
from
his
leash
when
he
finally
arrived
at
the
children
he
licked
and
licked
meanwhile
biden
was
talking
about
reality
we
choose
science
over
fiction
he
said
we
choose
truth
over
lies
people
murmured
supportively
then
the
french
bulldog's
owner
turned
to
me
smiled
and
said
he
really
likes
little
kids
