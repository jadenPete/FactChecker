reporter
misrepresents
trump
official
in
bad
faith
hit
job
forcing
official
to
resign
the
new
standard
isn't
the
truth
bloomberg
reporter
ben
penn
ignited
controversy
tuesday
after
publishing
an
expos
on
leif
olson
a
senior
policy
adviser
in
the
labor
department's
wage
and
hour
division
claiming
olson
made
anti-semitic
comments
on
facebook
three
years
ago
after
contacting
the
department
of
labor
about
the
alleged
anti-semitism
olson
tendered
his
resignation
penn
reported
however
upon
closer
examination
the
facebook
post
in
question
made
in
response
to
then-rep
paul
ryan's
blowout
win
against
challenger
paul
nehlen
in
actually
communicated
intelligible
criticism
of
the
alt-right
not
jews
it
was
sarcastic
criticism
of
the
alt-right's
conspiracy
theories
and
anti-semitic
positions
olsen
told
the
reporter
what
was
the
response
penn
was
excoriated
over
the
story
as
kyle
smith
noted
at
national
review
penn's
bad
faith
hit
job
both
got
basic
facts
wrong
and
provided
none
of
the
historical
or
tonal
context
necessary
for
accurately
portraying
olson's
facebook
comment
the
new
standard
isn't
the
truth
ideological
activists
working
at
putatively
neutral
news
outlets
now
use
of
standard
of
miscontrual
if
any
of
your
remarks
can
be
read
in
bad
faith
if
any
of
them
can
be
misconstrued
it
is
the
duty
of
the
reporter
to
misconstrue
them
for
the
public
this
standard
is
fatal
to
real
journalism
smith
said
philip
klein
of
the
washington
examiner
also
lambasted
penn
calling
his
story
one
of
the
most
shameful
egregious
media
failures
of
the
year
what's
particularly
amazing
is
that
penn
the
reporter
on
the
story
is
showing
no
remorse
defending
his
article
as
merely
having
asked
questions
to
the
department
about
it
klein
wrote
this
is
a
shameful
episode
in
media
bias
no
doubt
scores
of
twitter
responses
also
called
for
penn
to
resign
his
role
as
senior
reporter
at
bloomberg
or
for
the
news
outlet
to
fire
him
