transgender
teen's
lawyer
to
canadian
court
dad
guilty
of
family
violence
for
opposing
his
child's
testosterone
therapy
the
dad
doesn't
think
that
transgender
is
a
thing
that
it's
essentially
not
human
the
teen's
lawyer
said
the
lawyer
for
a
transgender
teenager
argued
that
a
canadian
court
correctly
ruled
that
the
father's
opposition
to
testosterone
therapy
for
his
year-old
child
amounted
to
family
violence
the
chronicle
herald
reported
the
teen's
attorney
barbara
findlay
also
told
the
appellate
court
thursday
that
a
lower
court
rightly
barred
the
father
from
talking
publicly
about
the
case
the
paper
said
for
a
transgender
person
having
the
world
refuse
to
accept
the
gender
identity
that
you
say
you
are
is
the
most
profound
harm
because
it's
a
denial
of
your
human
identity
findlay
added
according
to
the
chronicle
herald
the
dad's
expression
rights
end
at
the
point
where
they
harm
the
child
what's
the
background
the
british
columbia
appeal
court
is
hearing
arguments
concerning
a
transgender
boy
who's
identified
as
male
since
age
the
paper
said
a
psychologist
last
year
referred
the
child
to
b.c.
children's
hospital
for
gender
dysphoria
treatment
but
the
hospital's
gender
clinic
said
it
was
in
the
child's
best
interests
to
get
hormone
therapy
to
help
the
transition
from
a
female
body
to
a
male
body
and
got
consent
from
the
child
and
child's
mother
the
chronicle
herald
said
after
the
father
went
to
court
to
block
the
treatment
b.c.
supreme
court
justice
gregory
bowden
ruled
in
february
the
child
was
exclusively
entitled
to
consent
to
treatment
the
paper
said
bowden
added
that
the
child
also
must
be
called
by
male
pronouns
and
that
any
attempt
to
persuade
the
child
to
end
treatment
or
use
of
female
pronouns
when
referring
to
the
child
will
be
considered
family
violence
the
chronicle
herald
reported
b.c.
supreme
court
justice
francesca
marzari
issued
a
protection
order
in
april
barring
the
father
from
publicly
discussing
the
case
after
determining
that
interviews
he'd
given
to
conservative
media
outlets
potentially
exposed
his
child
to
violence
and
harassment
the
paper
said
with
that
the
dad
filed
an
appeal
saying
it
was
a
rush
to
judgment
by
the
court
that
all
scientific
opinion
on
such
treatments
weren't
considered
that
someone
his
child's
age
can't
understand
the
potential
consequences
of
a
still
experimental
treatment
and
that
an
order
preventing
him
from
publicly
discussing
the
case
steps
on
his
freedom
of
expression
the
chronicle
herald
noted
what
else
was
said
during
the
appellate
hearing
the
teen's
lawyer
read
excerpts
to
the
court
from
the
child's
affidavit
the
paper
said
it's
really
hard
to
explain
to
anybody
who's
not
transgender
how
terrible
it
feels
to
have
a
body
that
doesn't
match
your
gender
sometimes
i
feel
like
i
want
to
rip
my
skin
off
after
hormone
therapy
began
earlier
this
year
the
child
still
battles
depression
but
bodily
speaking
feels
better
the
chronicle
herald
noted
when
i
look
in
the
mirror
i
see
myself
it
is
so
amazing
to
feel
normal
more
from
the
paper
his
dad
doesn't
think
that
transgender
is
a
thing
that
it's
essentially
not
human
findlay
added
according
the
chronicle
herald
justice
barbara
fisher
questioned
whether
the
father's
actions
were
tantamount
to
family
violence
but
findlay
said
the
dad's
insistence
that
his
child
be
female
when
the
child
wants
to
be
a
male
equates
to
coercion
and
intimidation
the
paper
said
justice
harvey
groberman
also
wondered
if
the
court
has
the
right
to
make
such
medical
treatment
decisions
but
the
chronicle
herald
reported
that
findlay
said
her
client
is
right
to
say
to
the
court
i
need
help
here
more
from
the
paper
just
because
you
say
the
father
is
acting
in
a
particularly
evil
manner
would
not
seem
to
justify
restrictions
that
go
beyond
what's
necessary
he
said
according
the
chronicle
herald
but
lithwick
said
the
restrictions
were
necessary
the
paper
noted
and
that
the
father
has
repeatedly
shown
a
shocking
lack
of
discretion
and
consideration
toward
the
child
lithwick
cited
an
excerpt
from
the
child's
affidavit
the
chronicle
herald
said
i
don't
really
want
to
see
my
father
right
now
because
he
only
wants
to
harass
me
about
being
trans
the
child
is
distressed
because
of
the
mismatch
between
his
body
and
who
he
really
is
lithwick
added
according
to
the
paper
and
a
part
of
that
is
how
the
world
receives
him
and
his
dad
is
a
big
part
of
that
world
