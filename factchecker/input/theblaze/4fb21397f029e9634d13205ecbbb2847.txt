scott
walker
slaps
down
ocasio-cortez
for
claiming
her
generation
is
the
best
ever
aoc
takes
credit
for
things
that
her
generation
was
born
into
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
gushed
with
praise
for
her
generation
on
social
media
but
former
wisconsin
gov
scott
walker
differed
in
a
scathing
set
of
tweets
aimed
at
the
progressive
firebrand
ocasio-cortez
was
ridiculed
by
many
of
her
critics
for
gushing
about
how
wonderful
the
millennial
generation
was
especially
over
her
ahistorical
claim
that
they
are
the
first
to
go
to
the
streets
to
protest
for
political
purposes
i
think
young
people
are
more
informed
and
dynamic
than
their
predecessors
ocasio-cortez
said
in
a
video
broadcast
on
instagram
i
think
this
new
generation
is
very
profound
and
very
strong
and
very
brave
because
they're
actually
willing
to
go
to
the
streets
how
about
that
she
claimed
like
previous
generations
have
just
assumed
that
government's
got
it
she
explained
walker
did
not
agree
how
many
members
of
the
true
greatest
generation
fought
and
died
so
aoc
and
her
generation
could
have
the
peace
prosperity
they
enjoy
today
he
asked
rhetorically
in
a
tweet
thursday
walker
returned
to
the
topic
later
with
more
commentary
against
the
claims
from
ocasio-cortez
no
generation
in
human
history
has
ever
experienced
a
world
with
more
prosperity
more
freedom
more
leisure
time
more
access
to
information
higher
literacy
rates
better
life
expectancy
lower
child
mortality
less
poverty
less
disease
less
hunger
and
less
violent
crime
that
the
current
generation
he
charged
aoc
you
thank
the
greatest
generation
who
won
world
war
ii
for
the
peace
and
prosperity
you
enjoy
today
he
concluded
many
others
on
the
right
criticized
ocasio-cortez
for
what
appeared
to
be
a
shallow
assessment
of
the
greatness
of
previous
generations
in
comparison
to
hers
here's
more
about
the
most
aoc
generation
aoc
says
badass
millennials
are
the
true
greatest
generation
