chicago's
gun
offender
dashboard
aims
to
keep
violent
criminals
in
jail
but
raises
due
process
concerns
fair
use
of
public
information
or
fear-mongering
chicago
police
unveiled
an
online
database
that
allows
the
public
to
easily
view
a
list
of
suspects
charged
with
gun
offenses
and
whether
they
were
released
on
bail
hoping
to
draw
attention
to
the
alleged
problem
of
too
many
violent
criminals
quickly
getting
back
on
the
street
due
to
low
bail
amounts
critics
of
the
database
called
the
gun
offender
dashboard
say
the
database
is
harmful
in
that
it
paints
those
simply
accused
with
gun-related
crimes
not
just
violent
crimes
as
offenders
even
though
they
have
not
and
may
never
be
convicted
of
the
crimes
the
associated
press
reported
these
are
not
offenders
they're
arrestees

at
northwestern
university's

school
to
ap
chicago
mayor
lori
lightfoot
and
chicago
police
supt
eddie
johnson
believe
that
rules
requiring
judges
to
set
affordable
bail
amounts
for
suspects
who
are
deemed
not
to
be
a
danger
to
the
community
have
emboldened
violent
criminals
who
see
that
they
can
get
out
of
jail
relatively
easily
on
gun
charges
johnson
said
he
just
wants
the
information
out
and
easily
accessible
to
those
who
are
interested
in
it
if
we're
ok
with
how
things
are
going
then
don't
look
at
it
johnson
said
but
if
you
want
to
know
why
we
are
suffering
from
some
of
the
things
we
are
then
take
a
look
at
it
and
come
to
your
own
conclusions
cook
county
board
president
toni
preckwinkle
said
the
problem
is
that
police
aren't
doing
a
good
enough
job
of
making
arrests
for
violent
crimes
not
that
people
are
posting
bail
too
easily
preckwinkle
noted
that
arrests
are
made
in
only
in
homicides
and
in
shootings
in
chicago
cook
county
public
defender
amy
campanelli
took
issue
with
the
presentation
of
people
on
the
database
as
already
guilty
the
people
on
this
list
have
not
been
convicted
of
the
crimes
for
which
they
were
charged
campanelli
said
in
a
statement
yet
cpd
is
flaunting
bond
court
stats
as
if
they
have
already
been
convicted
