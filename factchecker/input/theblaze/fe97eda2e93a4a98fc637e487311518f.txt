christian
actor
cameron
arnett
says
that
he
left
mainstream
hollywood
when
he
was
asked
to
participate
in
nude
scenes
because
it
went
against
his
christian
faith
what
are
the
details
in
a
facebook
live
interview
with
miami
pastor
diego
calderon
the
year-old
actor
said
that
he
had
to
choose
career
or
christ
the
choice
for
arnett
who
stars
in
the
new
christian
film
overcomer
was
clear
before
signing
on
to
a
new
film
arnett
was
asked
to
do
a
partially
nude
scene
when
he
said
no
all
hell
broke
loose
the
actor
said
they
brought
me
in
and
i
auditioned
and
i
got
the
role
arnett
revealed
they
were
happy
and
the
money
was
going
to
be
really
nice
for
the
first
time
things
are
happening
and
right
before
i
signed
they
said
to
me
oh
by
the
way
we
need
you
to
do
partial
body
nudity
and
so
it
kind
of
like
put
a
halt
on
everything
and
i
felt
god
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
and
say
you
know
it's
time
to
get
out
of
the
system
arnett
explained
that
he
didn't
like
the
message
hollywood
was
sending
because
he
felt
it
was
a
direct
contradiction
of
god's
plan
for
him
hollywood
told
me
that
in
order
for
you
to
be
an
actor
you
have
to
do
partial
body
nudity
and
i
had
to
choose
career
or
christ
he
said
and
i
chose
christ
but
when
i
did
i
lost
everything
arnett
said
that
film
executives
promised
they
would
use
a
body
double
to
protect
his
modesty
but
arnett
was
still
uncomfortable
with
the
notion
i
lost
everything
he
admitted
agents
left
everybody
left
friends
left
i
was
left
behind
by
the
world
and
by
everything
that
i
had
arnett
who
plays
an
absentee
father
looking
for
restoration
in
overcomer
said
that
he
does
not
regret
walking
away
from
hollywood
as
a
whole
and
feels
fulfilled
working
in
christ-centered
projects
now
i
have
the
ability
to
be
myself
everywhere
and
not
have
to
compromise
anything
he
reasoned
what
about
the
movie
overcomer
a
kendrick
brothers
film
is
set
to
release
friday
it
also
stars
priscilla
shirer
and
shari
rigby
according
to
the
christian
post
the
film
tells
the
story
of
a
cross
country
runner
who's
pushing
her
limits
on
a
journey
that
leads
her
toward
self-discovery
in
god
