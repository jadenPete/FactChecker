appalling

former
ice
official
thomas
homan
berated
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
for
advocating
that
the
department
of
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
be
abolished
and
she
was
stunned
by
his
statement
the
interaction
occurred
at
the
end
of
his
testimony
before
the
house
oversight
committee
on
wednesday
i
am
proud
of
the
agency
and
ice
and
what
we
don't
want
to
talk
about
is
nearly
percent
of
everybody
ice
arrested
for
immigration
violations
either
have
a
criminal
history
or
a
pending
criminal
charges
when
they
are
found
meaning
they
were
found
in
a
county
jail
which
most
likely
means
they
are
more
than
a
choir
boy
said
homan
so
to
miss
message
what
the
work
the
men
and
women
of
ice
do
is
i
find
appalling
that
a
member
of
congress
would
throw
that
out
there
like
that
he
added
ocasio-cortez
interrupted
homan
and
attempted
to
cut
short
his
testimony
but
he
ignored
her
and
continued
in
my
years
i
have
never
seen
such
hate
toward
law
enforcement
agency
in
my
life
that
you
want
to
abolish
them
rather
than
do
your
job
and
legislate
he
added
mr
homan
your
time
is
expired
she
said
if
you
don't
like
it
legislate
he
concluded
homan
has
frequently
countered
criticism
by
members
of
congress
against
ice
by
reminding
them
that
the
agency
merely
enforces
the
laws
that
congress
passes
and
that
if
they
don't
like
it
they
should
pass
new
laws
here's
the
video
of
the
fiery
argument
