college
president
says
straight
pride
parade
is
a
desecration
and
a
perversion
but
doesn
t
bother
explaining
why
angry
and
misguided
people
are
running
this
show
according
to
the
president
lee
pelton
president
of
emerson
college
in
boston
penned
an
impassioned
letter
condemning
a
straight
pride
parade
set
to
take
place
saturday
near
the
school's
campus
borders
in
her
letter
he
insisted
that
the
parade
is
both
a
desecration
and
a
perversion
but
doesn't
exactly
say
why
he
feels
that
way
what
are
the
details
slamming
the
angry
and
misguided
people
planning
and
participating
in
the
parade
pelton
addressed
his
pointed
letter
to
the
faculty
staff
and
students
at
the
school
super
happy
fun
america
the
parade's
conservative
organizers
plan
to
host
the
parade
which
kicks
off
at
noon
on
saturday
at
nearby
copely
square
the
parade's
motto
is
it's
great
to
be
straight
according
to
usa
today
and
the
event's
facebook
page
calls
on
supporters
to
fight
against
heterophobia
in
our
modern
society
the
organization
also
calls
for
the
letter
s
to
be
added
to
lgbtq
to
represent
straight
pelton's
letter
addressed
the
emerson
college
community
as
a
whole
insisting
that
the
parade
was
simply
masquerading
as
freedom
of
speech
do
not
be
lulled
into
believing
this
parade
is
motivated
by
any
noble
obligation
to
protect
freedom
of
speech
or
assembly
pelton
warned
this
is
its
mask
only
and
behind
that
mask
are
a
group
of
angry
and
misguided
people
whose
aim
is
to
turn
a
cherished
american
value
e
pluribus
unum
out
of
many
one
on
its
head
pelton's
letter
added
the
ideological
motivation
as
i
wrote
earlier
is
ignorance
fear
and
its
hideous
offspring
hate
its
trope
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
larger
national
trope
its
rallying
cry
is
protect
our
borders
a
proxy
for
preserve
our
national
identity
and
in
this
case
preserve
straight
culture
whatever
that
might
mean
a
border
is
meant
to
keep
invaders
out
we
have
been
told
ad
nauseam
in
recent
months
it
is
conforming
and
confining
and
it
is
fear-based
and
mostly
it
is
meant
to
objectify
the
other
as
unworthy
as
deformed
as
disfigured
and
most
horribly
as
something
other
than
human
the
straight
pride
parade
is
a
perversion
pelton's
letter
insisted
it
is
a
desecration
of
beauty
truth
and
generosity
and
that
is
why
we
must
call
it
out
call
it
what
is
with
a
loud
clear
unambiguous
and
unified
voice
nothing
less
will
do
what
was
the
response
to
pelton's
letter
samson
racioppi
an
organizer
with
super
happy
fun
america
told
usa
today
that
pelton
should
retract
the
letter
and
issue
an
apology
for
writing
it
it
is
clear
that
freedom
of
speech
and
the
robust
exchange
of
ideas
in
society
is
not
welcome
at
emerson
college
based
off
their
extremely
intolerant
and
heterophobic
statement
issued
to
their
student
body
our
movement
is
one
of
unity
and
love
not
one
of
ignorance
as
alleged
by
the
emerson
president
racioppi's
statement
added
we
welcome
all
races
genders
and
sexual
orientations
to
our
parade
and
ceremony
at
city
hall
and
wish
for
the
emerson
community
and
all
of
boston
to
stand
with
us
in
solidarity
