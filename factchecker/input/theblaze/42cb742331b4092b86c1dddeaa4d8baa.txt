dutch
doctor
cleared
by
court
after
euthanizing
a
dementia
patient
without
her
consent
the
woman
had
said
that
she
wanted
to
be
euthanized
but
at
a
time
of
her
choosing
a
dutch
court
has
cleared
a
doctor
of
wrongdoing
after
she
euthanized
a
dementia
patient
who
had
indicated
that
she
wanted
to
be
euthanized
at
a
time
of
her
choosing
but
who
had
not
yet
given
consent
what
happened
according
to
the
guardian
the
year-old
woman
had
a
written
statement
saying
that
she
eventually
wanted
to
be
euthanized
but
also
to
be
able
to
decide
when
to
die
while
still
in
my
senses
and
when
i
think
the
time
is
right
but
her
doctor
had
come
up
with
a
euthanasia
date
of
her
own
and
had
two
other
doctors
sign
off
on
it
not
only
was
the
euthanasia
done
without
the
patient's
consent
it
took
time
to
complete
first
the
doctor
slipped
a
sedative
into
her
coffee
then
she
gave
her
a
shot
with
more
sedative
after
the
initial
dose
failed
to
take
effect
after
that
the
doctor
gave
the
patient
the
drug
intended
to
kill
her
but
instead
of
dying
the
patient
woke
up
and
got
out
of
bed
so
the
doctor
had
the
woman's
husband
and
adult
daughter
hold
her
down
while
she
gave
her
yet
another
dose
this
time
the
woman
died
the
woman's
daughter
who
had
held
her
to
the
bed
said
that
the
euthanasia
had
freed
my
mother
from
the
mental
prison
which
she
ended
up
in
even
prosecutors
were
sympathetic
toward
the
doctor
urging
the
judge
not
to
sentence
the
doctor
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial
since
she
had
acted
with
the
best
intentions
what
did
the
judge
decide
judge
mariette
renckens
cleared
the
doctor
of
any
fault
at
a
court
in
the
hague
saying
that
all
requirements
of
the
euthanasia
legislation
had
been
met
prosecutors
still
intend
to
appeal
the
decision
because
the
doctor
failed
to
get
the
woman's
and
she
may
have
changed
her
mind
euthanasia
has
been
legal
in
the
netherlands
since
