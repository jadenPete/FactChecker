demolishes
her
argument
oh

this
again
sen
ted
cruz
r-texas
took
actress
and
activist
alyssa
milano
to
task
over
remarks
she
made
questioning
second
amendment
rights
on
sunday
milano
questioned
the
validity
of
the
second
amendment
in
a
tweet
following
news
of
a
mass
killing
that
took
place
saturday
in
texas
a
year-old
suspect
shot
and
killed
at
least
seven
people
on
the
streets
of
odessa
texas
in
what
appeared
to
be
random
attacks
the
incident
resulted
in
the
injuries
of
nearly
two
dozen
other
people
the
midland
police
department
announced
that
the
suspect
was
killed
in
a
police
exchange
of
gunfire
shortly
after
the
suspect
carried
out
the
heinous
attack
what
happened
during
the
exchange
between
cruz
and
milano
in
a
pointed
tweet
milano
wrote
can
someone
cite
which
passage
of
the
bible
god
states
it
is
a
god-given
right
to
own
a
gun
this
guy
is
unbelievable
and
is
clearly
owned
by
the
gun
lobby
she
was
responding
to
a
tweet
from
rep
matt
schaefer
r-texas
who
promised
that
he
would
not
allow
the
mass
killer's
acts
put
a
damper
on
the
second
amendment
rights
of
texans
schaefer
wrote
i
am
not
going
to
use
the
evil
acts
of
a
handful
of
people
to
diminish
the
god-given
rights
of
my
fellow
texans
period
none
of
these
so-called
gun-control
solutions
will
work
to
stop
a
person
with
evil
intent
cruz
noticed
milano's
complaints
and
responded
in
kind
he
wrote
an
excellent
q
worth
considering
carefully
w
o
the
snark
of
twitter
it
is
of
course
not
the
right
to
a
modern-day
firearm
that
is
god-give
sic
but
rather
the
right
to
life
the
right
to
liberty
essential
to
that
right
to
life
is
the
right
to
defend
your
life
your
family
the
texas
lawmaker
continued
the
right
to
self-defense
is
recognized
repeatedly
in
the
bible
eg
exodus
if
a
thief
is
caught
breaking
in
at
night
is
struck
a
fatal
blow
the
defender
is
not
guilty
of
bloodshed
note
though
verse
says
it
is
murder
if
during
daylight
ie
not
self-defense
cruz
backs
up
his
pointhe
went
on
to
cite
a
passage
from
the
declaration
of
independence
to
bolster
his
explanation
the
declaration
of
independence
acknowledges
our
rights
thusly
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
he
quoted
and
for
that
reason
the
second
amendment
provides
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
it
wasn't
to
protect
people's
ability
to
hunt
or
to
shoot
target
practice
but
to
defend
their
lives
their
homes
their
families
cruz
invoked
the
name
of
texas
resident
stephen
willeford
who
risked
his
own
life
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
sutherland
springs
texas
mass
murderer
stephen
willeford
exercised
that
fundamental
right
when
he
risked
his
own
life
to
stop
the
sutherland
springs
murderer
saving
countless
others
as
a
result
he
added
cruz
continued
by
pointing
out
the
ideas
of
st
george
tucker
as
further
reading
for
milano
st
george
tucker
one
of
the
most
important
scholars
in
early
america
explained
the
reasons
behind
the
second
amendment
as
follows
this
may
be
considered
as
the
true
palladium
of
liberty
the
right
of
self
defence
is
the
first
law
of
nature
in
most
govts
it
has
been
the
study
of
rulers
to
confine
this
right
w
in
the
narrowest
limits
possible
wherever
the
right
to
keep
bear
arms
is
under
any
pretext
whatsoever
prohibited
liberty
if
not
already
annihilated
is
on
the
brink
of
destruction
that's
also
why
post
civil
war
disarming
black
americans
was
a
critical
objective
of
the
kkk
and
was
memorialized
in
countless
jim
crow
laws
to
strip
african-americans
of
their
god-given
right
to
self-defense
from
violence
he
reasoned
i'm
a
texan
what
happened
in
midland-odessa
and
el
paso
santa
fe
sutherland
springs
was
sick
deranged
horrifying
we
need
to
do
much
more
to
stop
violent
criminals
those
w
dangerous
mental
illness
before
they
murder
i'm
leading
the
fight
in
the
senate
to
do
so
he
concluded
that
playing
politics
with
such
heinous
crimes
is
not
the
way
to
carry
out
lasting
change
playing
politics
w
these
deranged
crimes
and
trying
to
use
them
as
an
excuse
to
violate
the
constl
rights
of
law-abiding
citizens
won't
make
anybody
safer
forcible
gun
confiscation
as
some
dems
urge
won't
prevent
mass-murders
but
it
would
weaken
our
self-defense
