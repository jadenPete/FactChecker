what
are
the
details
superbia
credit
union
boasts
on
its
website
that
it
is
the
first
ever
profit-for-purpose
financial
institution
that
exists
solely
to
serve
and
advocate
for
the
lgbtq
community
across
the
country
founder
myles
meyers
explained
his
reasoning
behind
the
idea
to
fortune
saying
i
can
walk
into
a
bank
or
credit
union
and
apply
for
a
loan
or
credit
card
or
savings
accounts
and
frankly
no
problem
if
i
walked
in
to
the
same
institution
with
my
husband
we
can
come
across
different
responses
and
welcome
and
this
is
where
it
all
starts
to
change
for
the
community
the
charter
for
superbia's
formation
was
approved
by
the
state
of
michigan
department
of
insurance
and
financial
services
on
monday
and
its
founders
will
now
begin
working
with
regulatory
bodies
to
receive
the
required
approvals
that
will
make
the
credit
union
operational
by
early
the
oakland
press
reported
state
sen
jeremy
moss
explained
to
the
newspaper
state
law
doesn't
protect
michigan's
lgbtq
community
from
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
public
accommodations
it's
burdensome
that
gay
and
trans
michiganders
must
depend
on
private
businesses
to
take
it
upon
themselves
to
provide
equal
treatment
to
employees
and
consumers
fortunately
many
lgbtq
business
owners
and
entrepreneurs
have
stepped
up
to
specifically
cater
to
the
needs
of
our
community
moss
added
and
i'm
especially
excited
to
welcome
in
superbia
credit
union
to
michigan
as
a
safe
space
to
bank
and
obtain
lines
of
credit
without
fear
of
discrimination
anything
else
superbia
credit
union
promises
to
provide
access
to
fair
non-discriminatory
products
and
services
that
care
for
the
unique
needs
of
the
lgbtq
community
delivered
with
an
affirming
experience
thirty
percent
of
the
institution's
profits
will
go
directly
to
lgbtq
organizations
initiatives
and
community
needs
locally
and
across
the
country
anyone
in
support
of
the
institution's
mission
is
welcome
to
