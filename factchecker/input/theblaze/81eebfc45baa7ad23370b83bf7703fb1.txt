has
to
assure
people
it
isn't
making
burgers
with
human
flesh
an

led
to
an

exactly
the

dairy
queen
location

wait
what
happened
it
all
started
with
an
internet
rumor
as
so
many
viral
but
fictitious
stories
do
the
story
gained
traction
after
locals
saw
this
dairy
queen
franchise
location
being
raided
by
federal
agents
from
the
fbi
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
as
well
as
south
carolina
law
enforcement
however
it
appears
that
this
raid
was
related
to
two
men
who
were
arrested
for
using
that
location
to
transfer
money
illegally
franchise
manager
saif
momin

that
his
restaurant
had
anything
to
do
with
this
criminal
activity

tweet
from

the
manager
of
this
particular
dairy
queen
location
had
reached
out
to
the
news
outlet
hoping
he
could
help
squash
the
cannibalcombo
rumor
readers
of
the
paper
had
also
posted
about
it
according
to
the
index-journal
an
unnamed
person
had
lodged
a
complaint
about
human
meat
being
inside
a
burger
if
that
was
the
case
they
already
would
have
shut
me
down
momin
told
the
index-journal
what
else
local
officials
also
dismissed
the
rumors
i
promise
you
i've
never
had
anything
of
that
nature
asked
of
me
i've
never
suspected
anything
like
that
i
can
honestly
say
that's
the
first
i've
heard
of
it
and
i
don't
see
any
validity
in
that
at
all
greenwood
county
coroner
sonny
cox
told
the
index-journal
on
aug
there's
little
to
no
chance
of
anything
like
that
ever
being
able
to
happen
