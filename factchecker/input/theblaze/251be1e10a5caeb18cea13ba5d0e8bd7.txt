said
during
an
interview
on
sunday
that
americans
need
to
accept
the
pain
that
comes
from
president
donald
trump's
tariffs
in
order
to
get
china
to
change
what
impact
are
the
tariffs
having
on
americans
in
addition
to
drying
up
the
multibillion
dollar
chinese
market
for
american
goods
like
sorghum
and
soybeans
u.s.
tariffs
have
also
increased
the
cost
of
products
made
with
steel
and
aluminum
this
has
led
to
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
products
sold
in
the
u.s.
from
farming
equipment
to
household
appliances
like
washing
machines
u.s.
companies
that
import
goods
from
china
or
other
countries
hit
by
u.s.
tariffs
have
also
been
forced
to
pay
for
these
tariffs
directly
in
order
to
compensate
for
this
new
cost
the
prices
of
the
goods
hit
by
the
tariffs
has
often
increased
these
costs
have
led
the
federal
government
to
give
american
farmers
nearly
billion
in
emergency
aid
on
aug
trump
did
not
deny
speculation
that
his
tariffs
could
cause
a
small
recession
saying
instead
that
somebody
had
to
take
on
china
what
did
graham
say
consumer
prices
on
commodities
are
gonna
go
up
graham
admitted
to
cbs
face
the
nation
host
margaret
brennan
we're
now
to
that
part
of
the
trade
war
where
you
feel
price
increases
at
walmart
mentioning
that
trump
had
suggested
he
would
delay
additional
tariffs
until
dec
for
the
holiday
shopping
season
graham
said
that
he
would
tell
trump
mr
president
listen
you've
got
more
bullets
than
they
do
they
sell
us
a
lot
more
stuff
than
we
sell
them
and
the
goal
is
to
get
them
to
change
their
behavior
the
chinese
government
the
chinese
army
and
the
chinese
business
community
are
one
and
the
same
they're
very
mercantile
you
don't
have
these
suffused
among
democracies
but
the
chinese
communist
party
runs
everything
in
china
until
they
feel
the
pain
they're
not
going
to
stop
china
does
sell
substantially
more
merchandise
to
the
u.s.
than
it
gets
in
return
last
year
the
u.s.
imported
billion
worth
of
goods
from
china
and
exported
billion
to
china
a
billion
disparity
this
trade
deficit
which
trump
often
cites
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
his
trade
war
was
up
from
billion
in
and
billion
in
