cnn
host
has
shocking
reaction
to
guest
who
claims
trump
will
kill
many
millions
more
than
hitler
stalin
mao
must
hand
it
to
cnn
finally
they
help
deem
trump
a
larger
mass
murderer
than
hitler
mao
and
stalin
psychiatrist
allen
frances
claimed
on
cnn's
reliable
sources
sunday
that
president
donald
trump's
leadership
will
result
in
more
deaths
than
the
destructive
actions
of
hitler
stalin
and
mao
frances
professor
emeritus
of
psychiatry
and
behavioral
sciences
at
duke
university
said
while
frances
comments
were
shocking
considering
adolf
hitler
joseph
stalin
and
mao
zedong
were
collectively
responsible
for
killing
tens
of
millions
of
people
even
more
stunning
was
the
fact
that
show
host
brian
stelter
did
not
interject
question
push
back
or
fact
check
frances
instead
stelter
allowed
frances
to
continue
talking
while
he
stared
directly
into
the
camera
stelter's
reaction
or
more
aptly
his
non-reaction
triggered
a
wave
of
backlash
on
social
media
he
was
criticized
for
not
pushing
back
or
questioning
frances
outlandish
claim
a
routine
responsibility
for
show
hosts
erick
erickson

pollster

donald
trump
jr
how
did
stelter
respond
he
said
he
should
have
interrupted
frances
but
didn't
because
he
did
not
hear
what
frances
said
stelter
claimed
he
was
distracted
by
tech
difficulties
but
not
everyone
believed
stelter
because
as
the
daily
wire's
ryan
saavedra
noted
cnn
promoted
the
segment
that
included
the
comments
on
social
media
