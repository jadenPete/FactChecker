california

gavin

tuesday
that
ended
the
legal
requirement
for
citizens

a
police
officer
in
need
upon
request
according
to
the
daily
caller
the
bill
repealed
the
california
posse
comitatus
act
of
which
dictated
that
it
was
a
misdemeanor
for
any
able-bodied
person
years
of
age
or
older
to
refuse
to
assist
an
officer
in
making
an
arrest
retaking
into
custody
a

who
has
escaped
from

or
imprisonment
or
preventing
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
the
commission
of
any
criminal
offense
senate
bill
was
authored
by
state
sen
bob
hertzberg
d
who
called
the
law
a
vestige
of
a
bygone
era
and
said
the
law's
requirements
could
subject
citizens
to
an
untenable
moral
dilemma
hertzberg
said
he
told
his
interns
to
scour
the
books
for
any
laws
that
were
outdated
and
needed
to
be
repealed
thank
you
to
my
interns
for
finding
a
law
that
belongs
in
the
history
books
not
the
law
books
hertzberg
said
according
to
cnn
the
california
state
sheriff's
association
issued
a
statement
in
june
saying
it
felt
that
repealing
the
law
was
unnecessary
we
are
unfamiliar
with
concerns
with
this
statute
other
than
it
was
enacted
many
years
ago
and
carries
a
fine
for
a
person
who
disobeys
it
the
statement
read
there
are
situations
in
which
a
peace
officer
might
look
to
private
persons
for
assistance
in
matters
of
emergency
or
risks
to
public
safety
and
we
are
unconvinced
that
this
statute
should
be
repealed
the
law
has
some
controversial
associations
which
may
have
contributed
to
its
repeal
according
to
the
sacramento
bee
it
was
sometimes
employed
for
the
purpose
of
catching
runaway
slaves
according
to
the
naval
history
and
heritage
command
posse
comitatus
was
invoked
by
the
fugitive
slave
act
to
allow
federal
marshals
to
summon
and
call
to
their
aid
the
bystanders
or
posse
comitatus
of
the
proper
county
and
all
good
citizens
were
commanded
to
aid
and
assist
in
the
prompt
and
efficient
execution
of
this
law
