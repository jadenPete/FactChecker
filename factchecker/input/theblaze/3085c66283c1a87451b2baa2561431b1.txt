a
london
aquarium
says
it's
planning
to
raise
a
genderless
penguin
uh
what
a
british
aquarium
has
announced
that
a
gentoo
penguin
chick
adopted
by
a
same-sex
set
of
penguin
parents
will
be
raised
as
gender-neutral
by
its
keepers
according
to
a
cnn
report
the
chick
will
not
be
named
or
characterized
as
male
or
female
sea
life
aquarium
in
london
told
the
network
that
it
will
be
the
world's
first
penguin
to
not
have
its
gender
assigned
if
the
genderless
penguin
is
eventually
named
it
will
be
given
a
gender-neutral
name
a
report
at
the
daily
mail
explains
this
is
all
happening
because
aquarists
decided
it
was
more
natural
for
the
chick
to
grow
and
develop
into
a
mature
adult
as
genderless
which
is
normal
in
the
wild
until
they
mature
according
to
a
news
release
while
the
decision
may
ruffle
a
few
feathers
gender
neutrality
in
humans
has
only
recently
become
a
widespread
topic
of
conversation
however
it
is
completely
natural
for
penguins
to
develop
genderless
identities
as
they
grow
into
mature
adults
general
manager
graham
mcgrath
said
in
a
statement
the
chick
has
been
adopted
by
a
pair
of
female
penguins
named
rocky
and
marama
after
a
female
in
the
colony
was
unable
to
care
for
it
what
makes
us
really
proud
at
the
aquarium
is
the
success
of
sea
life
london's
gentoo
breeding
program
and
the
amazing
job
of
same-sex
penguins
rocky
and
marama
who
took
the
chick
under
their
wing
and
raised
it
as
their
own
mcgrath
said
this
is
the
second
big
story
involving
same-sex
penguins
to
make
headlines
recently
back
in
august
multiple
outlets
reported
on
the
story
of
a
pair
of
male
penguins
at
a
zoo
in
berlin
that
had
adopted
an
abandoned
egg
