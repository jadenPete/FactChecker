cnn
host
has
shocking
reaction
to
guest
who
claims
trump
will
kill
many
millions
more
than
hitler
stalin
mao
must
hand
it
to
cnn
finally
they
help
deem
trump
a
larger
mass
murderer
than
hitler
mao
and
stalin
psychiatrist
allen
frances
claimed
on
cnn's
reliable
sources
sunday
that
president
donald
trump's
leadership
will
result
in
more
deaths
than
the
destructive
actions
of
hitler
stalin
and
mao
frances
professor
emeritus
of
psychiatry
and
behavioral
sciences
at
duke
university
said
calling
trump
crazy
hides
the
fact
that
we're
crazy
for
having
elected
him
and
even
crazier
for
allowing
his
crazy
policies
to
persist
trump
is
as
destructive
a
person
in
this
century
as
hitler
stalin
and
mao
were
in
the
last
century
he
may
be
responsible
for
many
million
more
deaths
than
they
were
he
needs
to
be
contained
but
he
needs
to
be
contained
by
attacking
his
policies
not
his
person
while
frances
comments
were
shocking
considering
adolf
hitler
joseph
stalin
and
mao
zedong
were
collectively
responsible
for
killing
tens
of
millions
of
people
even
more
stunning
was
the
fact
that
show
host
brian
stelter
did
not
interject
question
push
back
or
fact
check
frances
instead
stelter
allowed
frances
to
continue
talking
while
he
stared
directly
into
the
camera
cnn
guest
allen
frances
claims
trump
has
killed
more
than
hitler
stelter's
reaction
or
more
aptly
his
non-reaction
triggered
a
wave
of
backlash
on
social
media
he
was
criticized
for
not
pushing
back
or
questioning
frances
outlandish
claim
a
routine
responsibility
for
show
hosts
erick
erickson
fox
news
host
greg
gutfeld
daily
caller
reporter
chuck
ross

donald
trump
jr
how
did
stelter
respond
he
said
he
should
have
interrupted
frances
but
didn't
because
he
did
not
hear
what
frances
said
stelter
claimed
he
was
distracted
by
tech
difficulties
i
agree
that
i
should
have
interrupted
after
that
line
i
wish
i
had
heard
him
say
it
but
i
was
distracted
by
tech
difficulties
that's
why
the
show
open
didn't
look
the
way
it
normally
does
i
had
two
computers
at
the
table
etc
not
hearing
the
comment
is
my
fault
brian
stelter
brianstelter
august
but
not
everyone
believed
stelter
because
as
the
daily
wire's
ryan
saavedra
noted
cnn
promoted
the
segment
that
included
the
comments
on
social
media
