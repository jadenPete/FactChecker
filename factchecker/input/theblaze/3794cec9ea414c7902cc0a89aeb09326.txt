just
like
black
friday
on
steroids
the
first
costco
store
in
china
opened
tuesday
in
shanghai
and
the
enthusiasm
from
customers
was
so
great
that
the

had
to
shut
down
by
the
afternoon
due
to
out-of-control
crowds
according
to
the
south
china
morning
post
anticipation
was
so
intense
for
the
store's
opening
that
traffic
leading
into
the
store
blocked
streets
and
led
to
a
three-hour
wait
just
to
park
customers
who
managed
to
get
in
were
also
subjected
to
two-hour
wait
times
to
check
out
when
they
were
done
shopping
by
noon
the
store
was
begging
customers
not
to
come
to
the
store
via
text
message
the
store
has
been
clogged
up
with
crowds
to
provide
you
with
a
better
shopping
experience
costco
will
suspend
business
in
the
afternoon
a
text
message
to

shoppers
reported
that
altercations
broke
out
between
customers
fighting
over
items
as
upscale
as
hermes
birkin
bags
and
as
simple
as
rotisserie
chicken
shanghai

your

we
hope

hours
a

read
those

already
gone
there
you
must
follow

in
the
future
the

will
limit
the

we'd
like
to
apologize
for
the
inconvenience
caused
to
our
members
on
our
warehouse
opening
day
in
shanghai
a
costco
statement
read
due
to
security
concerns
we
decided
to
close
the
warehouse
early
our
most
important
concern
is
the
safety
and
good
experience
of
our
members
the
overwhelming
success
of
the
costco
opening
comes
in
the
midst
of
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
during
which
president
donald
trump
called
for
u.s.
companies
to
begin
exploring
ways
to
pull
out
of
china
our
great
american
companies
are
hereby
ordered
to
immediately
start
looking
for
an
alternative
to
china
including
bringing
your
companies
home
and
making
your
products
in
the
usa
trump
wrote
on
twitter
last
week
the
scene
at
costco
on
tuesday
may
serve
as
an
illustration
of
why
many
u.s.
companies
may
not
want
to
do
that
this
is
a
great
example
that
shows
how
hard
it
will
be
for
u.s.
companies
to
dump
the
china
market
financial
columnist
xiao
lei
said
the
chinese
market
still
has
great
consumption
power
particularly
for
high-end
goods
it
will
be
hard
for
u.s.
corporates
to
give
up
this
