left-wing
woman
saying
guys
is
now
politically
incorrect
because
it's
lazy
inconsiderate
and
reinforces
the
gender
hierarchy
think
about
what
comes
out
of
your
mouth
before
you
say
it
if
you're
used
to
speaking
the
word
guys
particularly
when
addressing
a
mixed-gender
group
you
might
want
to
think
about
changing
your
ways
at
least
that's
what
a
left-wing
producer
from
nowthis
news
said
in
a
monday
video
during
which
she
explained
in
great
detail
complete
with
historical
background
why
saying
guys
is
lazy
inconsiderate
and
reinforces
the
gender
hierarchy
some
tidbits
guys
is
among
many
male
default
terms
that
should
not
be
normalized
foluk
tuakli
declared
she
also
noted
that
saying
guys
has
the
effect
of
only
addressing
the
men
in
the
room
and
that
its
cognitive
impact
on
women
and
gender
non-conforming
folk
by
must
be
faced
oh
but
don't
worry
tuakli
added
that
you're
not
a
bad
feminist
if
the
word
guys
slips
from
your
mouth
every
once
in
a
while
after
all
she
noted
that
there
are
larger
issues
that
we
the
feminists
need
to
combat
reproductive
rights
rape
culture
violence
against
women
lgbtq
rights
and
the
general
reprogramming
of
most
peoples
minds
when
it
comes
to
the
valuation
of
women
in
society
general
reprogramming
of
most
peoples
minds
eh
oh
but
there's
more
she
also
said
that
by
embarking
on
this
not-saying-
guys
anymore
mission
you're
one
small
step
away
from
making
a
more
conscious
effort
to
dismantle
the
patriarchy
tuakli
even
offered
some
words
you
can
utter
in
lieu
of
a
hey
guys
greeting
such
as
good
morning
everyone
and
hi
y'all
and
when
in
doubt
she
noted
say
nothing
at
all
i
challenge
you
to
take
an
extra
point-five
seconds
to
think
about
what
comes
out
of
your
mouth
before
you
say
it
tuakli
added
that
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
although
that
phrase
also
has
been
deemed
politically
incorrect
