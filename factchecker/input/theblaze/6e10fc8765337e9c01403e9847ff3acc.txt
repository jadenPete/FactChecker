last
year
a
catholic
college
in
ohio
has
canceled
its
annual
drag
show
after
a
student
newspaper
column
against
the
event
sparked
controversy
last
year
cleveland
com
reported
a
john
carroll
university
spokesman
told
the
outlet
that
divisiveness
on
the
jesuit
school's
campus
led
to
the
decision
we
are
working
with
our
students
on
new
and
more
extensive
programming
that
will
promote
the
expression
appreciation
and
understanding
of
the
many
identities
represented
at
john
carroll
university
the
spokesman
said
we
are
also
engaging
with
community
partners
alumni
and
experts
to
advance
the
understanding
of
different
points
of
view
related
to
sexuality
faith
inclusion
and
respect
what
did
the
column
say
i
can't
help
but
wonder
who
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
hire
grown
men
to
dress
up
as
women
on
a
catholic
campus
for
the
deviant
entertainment
of
misguided
young
people

leary's
piece
in
the
carroll
news
noted
last
october
after
his
piece
ran
leary
said
he
was
harassed
over
his
words
charged
with
hate
speech
by
progressive
students
and
summoned
to
meetings
with
school
officials
leary
told
the
college
fix
that
progressive
students
who
have
the
support
of
the
institutional
power
here
have
been
very
aggressively
calling
for
me
to
be
silenced
and
attempting
to
discredit
me
and
my
writing
their
message
is
essentially
that
my
column
is
hate
speech
because
it
attacks
their
beliefs
and
that
the
university
should
not
allow
someone
like
me
to
speak
out
the
fix
added
that
leary
provided
nearly
a
dozen
letters
the
carroll
news
received
over
his
column
a
number
of
which
accused
the
author
of
promoting
hate
or
hate
speech
the
newspaper
stood
by
leary's
column
calling
the
matter
a
free
speech
