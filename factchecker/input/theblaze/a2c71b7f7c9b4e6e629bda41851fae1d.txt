matter
they
can
make

in

also
appeal
to
the
worst
damn
instincts
of
human
nature
anything
else
during
the
first
democratic
presidential
primary
debate
biden
took
a
hit
of
his
own
over
racism
from
sen
kamala
harris
who
called
him
out
for
talking
about
the
reputations
of
two
united
states
senators
who
built
their
reputations
and
careers
on
the
segregation
of
race
in
this
country
that
exchange
served
as
a
boost
for
harris's
campaign
at
the
time
and
biden
took
notice
of
the
hit
while
he
didn't
name
names
when
asked
who
he
would
potentially
ask
to
be
a
running
mate
were
he
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
he
said
whomever
i
pick
would
be
preferably
someone
who
is
of
color
and
who
was
of
a
different
gender
but
i'm
not
making
that
commitment
until
i
know
that
the
person
i'm
dealing
with
i
can
completely
thoroughly
trust
is
authentic
and
is
on
the
same
page
