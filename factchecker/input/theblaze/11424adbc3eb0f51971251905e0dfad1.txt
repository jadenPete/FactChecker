two
australian
bloggers
went
to
iran
to
prove
that
it's
a
great
place
to
travel
now
they've
been
sitting
in
an
iranian
prison
for
weeks
australia
has
been
trying
to
get
their
people
released
two
australian
bloggers
believed
that
the
media
were
overhyping
the
dangers
of
travelling
to
iran
so
they
traveled
there
to
prove
how
safe
it
was
and
were
arrested
what's
the
story
mark
firkin
and
jolie
king
left
australia
in
and
began
travelling
through
asia
en
route
to
the
united
kingdom
our
biggest
motivation
is
to
hopefully
inspire
anyone
wanting
to
travel
and
also
try
to
break
the
stigma
around
travelling
to
countries
which
get
a
bad
wrap
sic
in
the
media
they
wrote
during
their
trip
according
to
an
itinerary
they
posted
on
instagram
they
travelled
across
australia
by
car
before
having
their
toyota
landcruiser
shipped
to
malaysia
so
that
they
could
continue
their
journey
by
land
their
last
instagram
post
on
their
youtube
upload
were
both
from
june
king
posted
her
last
post
on
her
personal
instagram
account
on
june
while
details
of
the
reasons
for
their
arrests
are
scarce
australia's
abc
news
reported
that
the
two
has
been
held
as
prisoners
for
about
weeks
the
couple
had
been
using
a
drone
to
take
some
of
the
photos
and
videos
something
that
ran
afoul
of
iran's
strict
laws
the
outlet
said
persian
language
manoto
tv
also
reported
that
firkin
and
king
had
been
flying
a
drone
near
the
capital
tehran
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
said
that
his
government
was
working
to
resolve
this
matter
but
refused
to
provide
additional
details
these
are
always
very
sensitive
cases
and
they
are
never
issues
that
are
addressed
well
by
offering
public
commentary
on
them
he
said
in
a
statement
reported
by
the
guardian
the
families
of
both
australians
said
our

hope
to

jolie
safely
home
as
soon
as
possible
