here's
what
we
know
dhs
was
not
asking
congress's
permission
for
this
move
but
rather
informing
the
legislative
branch
about
the
reallocation
of

also
under
the
dhs
umbrella
the
funds
will
not

asylum
cases
in
mexico
an
unnamed
dhs
official
who
spoke
with
cnn
said
that
the
transfer
of
funds
was
necessary
because
this
is
a
must-pay
bill
that
needed
to
be
addressed
in
a
statement
to
nbc
news
sen
jon
tester
d-mont
said
that
the
move
would
drain
millions
from
agencies
tasked
with
protecting
the
homeland
from
security
threats
and
natural
disasters
like
hurricanes
and
wildfires
including
cbp
tsa

he
added
that
congress
had
already
appropriated
the
highest-ever
funding
for
border
security
and
immigration
enforcement
which
passed
on
a
bipartisan
basis
and
was
signed
by
president
trump
