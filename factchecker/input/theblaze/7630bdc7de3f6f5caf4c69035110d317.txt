jemele

former
espn
personality
and
current
writer
for
the
atlantic
wrote
that
elite
black
athletes
should
stop
attending
predominantly
white
colleges
and
should
instead
use
their
talent
and
fame
to
lift
up
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
hill
points
out
the
disparity
in
prominence
and
resources
in
college
athletics
between
the
best
programs
which
are
all
from
predominantly
white
schools
and
the
hbcus
that
bring
in
only
a
fraction
of
the
revenue
of
the
top
programs
she
established
her
point
by
using
the
story
of
kayvon
thibodeaux
the
top
high
school
football
player
in
the
class
of
thibodeaux
visited
florida
a
m
an
hbcu
before
ultimately
deciding
to
attend
the
university
of
oregon

thibodeaux
told
hill
about
his
decision
black
athletes
need
to
understand
that
the
money
will
go
wherever
they
do
hill
argues
and
so
they
should
use
that
influence
to
elevate
hbcus
and
the
black
communities
they
are
often
located
within
bringing
elite
athletic
talent
back
to
black
colleges
would
have
potent
downstream
effects
hill
wrote
it
would
boost
hbcu
revenues
and
endowments
stimulate
the
economy
of
the
black
communities
in
which
many
of
these
schools
are
embedded
amplify
the
power
of
black
coaches
who
are
often
excluded
from
prominent
positions
at
predominantly
white
institutions
and
bring
the
benefits
of
black
labor
back
to
black
people
elite
high
school
athletes
typically
choose
the
same
group
of
elite
and
predominantly
white
schools
because
they
want
to
go
somewhere
with
the
best
facilities
the
most
opportunity
for
exposure
and
with
the
greatest
chance
of
advancing
to
the
professional
level
in
their
sport
hill
argues
that
the
system
needs
to
be
disrupted
and
that
predominantly
white
institutions
don't
deserve
to
continue
benefitting
from
lucrative
athletics
programs
that
are
disproportionately
black
when
compared
with
the
student
populations
if
promising
black
student
athletes
chose
to
attend
hbcus
in
greater
numbers
they
would
at
a
minimum
bring
some
welcome
attention
and
money
to
beleaguered
black
colleges
which
invested
in
black
people
when
there
was
no
athletic
profit
to
reap
hill
wrote
more
revolutionarily
perhaps
they
could
disrupt
the
reign
of
an
amateur
sports
system
that
uses
the
labor
of
black
folks
to
make
white
folks
rich
