what
are
the
details
the
new
richmond

lions
football

asked
its
participants
to

optic
ready

according
to
wxix-tv
about
elementary
students
ranging
in
ages
to
participate
in
the
program
parent
heather
chilton
said
that
she
was
shocked
that
her
year-old
daughter
was
asked
to
sell
such
raffle
tickets
this
is
absurd
you're
having
elementary
school
kids
sell
your
ar-
she
complained
why
i
highly
doubt
that
something
would
happen
with
the
gun
but
say
it
did
say
one
of
the
kids
in
the
high
school
got
a
hold
of
it
got
the
ar-
or
am-
and
shot
up
a
school
with
it
and
i'm
the
one
that
sold
the
raffle
ticket
to
his
dad
chilton
complained
that
she
received
the
fundraiser
raffle
package
in
july
requiring
that
all
cheerleaders
were
required
to
sell
at
least
five
raffle
tickets
for
the
am-
and
five
tickets
for
a
gift
basket
at
each
chilton
said
that
parents
were
required
to
pay
a
opt-out
fee
per
child
if
they
refused
to
sell
the
raffle
tickets
with
me
doing
this
i'm
teaching
the
girls
they
have
to
stand
up
for
what
they
believe
she
added
this
is
something
that
they
shouldn't
even
have
to
worry
about
dealing
with
or
even
be
around
the
league's
president
robert
wooten
doesn't
see
an
issue
for
the
most
part
it's
easy
to
sell
he
said
of
the
am-
it's
a
hot
item

else
wooten
said
that
he
only
received
complaints
about
the
raffle
this
year
and
that
the
program
has
used
the
same
or
similar
fundraisers
over
the
past
four
years
that
have
all
rendered
very
effective
fundraising
results
we
are
compassionate
on
where
people
may
be
on
the
gun
issue
wooten
reasoned
this
was
not
a
way
for
us
to
promote
gun
violence
or
incite
violence
we
are
going
to
reevaluate
this
next
year
wooten
also
addressed
chilton's
claims
that
families
would
be
billed
fees
for
passing
on
the
fundraising
program
we're
not
going
to
send
them
a
bill
he
said
insisting
that
the
fundraiser
is
optional
we
don't
operate
that
way
despite
criticism
from
league
parents
wooten
said
the
gun
raffle
tickets
sold
like
hotcakes
the
winner
of
the
am-
will
be
announced
on
sept
and
will
have
to
pass
a
standard
fbi
background
check
in
order
to
obtain
the
firearm
