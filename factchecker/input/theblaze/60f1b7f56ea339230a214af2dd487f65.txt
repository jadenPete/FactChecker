what
are
the
details
in
a
statement
greg
laurie
the
church's
senior
pastor
wrote
sometimes
people
think
that
as
pastors
or
spiritual
leaders
we
are
somehow
above
the
pain
and
struggles
of
everyday
people
we
are
the
ones
who
are
supposed
to
have
all
the
answers
but
we
do
not
he
added
describing
wilson
as
a
vibrant
man
who
was
always
serving
and
helping
others
wilson
who
in
co-founded
christian
organization
anthem

a

he
wrote
loving
jesus
doesn't
always
cure
suicidal
thoughts
loving
jesus
doesn't
always
cure
depression
loving
jesus
doesn't
always
cure
ptsd
loving
jesus
doesn't
always
cure
anxiety
but
that
doesn't
mean
jesus
doesn't
offer
us
companionship
and
comfort
he
always
does
that
in
an
instagram
post
his
wife
juli
memorialized
her
late
husband
in
a
moving
tribute
what
else
in
august
wilson
offered
up
a
moving
response
to
entertainer
and
activist
alyssa
milano's
remarks
that
her
previous
abortions
helped
to
usher
in
her
life's
greatest
joys
earlier
that
month
the
actress
revealed
her
two
abortions
which
took
place
when
she
was
in
her
s
and
boasted
that
her
abortions
freed
her
up
to
enjoy
life
declaring
that
her
life
would
be
completely
lacking
all
its
great
joys
if
it
weren't
for
those
abortions
in
response
to
her
remarks
wilson
shared
a
photo
of
his
two
young
children
on
twitter
and
captioned
it
everyone
should
post
a
picture
of
their
kids
and
use
the
hashtag
greatjoys
wilson
later
told
faithwire
that
children
are
a
blessing
from
god
and
should
be
treated
as
such
children
are
our
future
and
a
blessing
from
god
not
a
burden
that
so
many
people
specifically
people
who
are
only
focused
on
their
own
achievement
and
goals
make
them
out
to
be
wilson
said
wilson
added
that
people
need
to
stop
treating
children
and
pregnancy
like
they
are
disposable
commodities
is
choosing
abortion
unforgivable
wilson
continued
not
at
all
but
i
believe
milano's
views
on
the
subject
to
be
both
harmful
and
mentally
disturbing
he
concluded
children
should
be
celebrated
not
looked
down
upon
