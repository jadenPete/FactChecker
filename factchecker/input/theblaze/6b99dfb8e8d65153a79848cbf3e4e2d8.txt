j.
peterman
on
seinfeld
says
that
will
grace
stars
eric
mccormack
and
debra
messing
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
appearing
to
advocate
for
the
doxxing
and
blacklisting
of
hollywood
trump
supporters
what's
a
brief
history
here
on
sunday
the
hollywood
reporter
published
a
news
item
revealing
that
president
donald
trump
is
set
to
appear
at
a
beverly
hills
california
event
hosted
by
top
republican
national
committee
leadership
tickets
for
the
sept
event
are
going
for
as
much
as
mccormack
responded
to
the
news
by
requesting
the
outlet
to
publish
names
of
those
in
the
entertainment
business
who
dared
attend
the
event
he
wrote
hey
thr
kindly
report
on
everyone
attending
this
event
so
the
rest
of
us
can
be
clear
about
who
we
don't
wanna
work
with
thx
messing
chimed
in
with
agreement
writing
please
print
a
list
of
all
attendees
please
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
so
what
did
o'hurley
say
o'hurley
addressed
the
will
grace
stars
remarks
during
a
labor
day
broadcast
of
fox
news
america's
news
headquarters
in
talks
about
liberalism
and
hollywood
o'hurley
said
that
he
respects
both
parties
but
is
embarrassed
for
mccormack
and
messing
let
me
just
say
that
i'm
embarrassed
for
both
of
them
he
said
and
i'll
say
this
because
i
know
them
both
and
i've
worked
with
debra
before
they're
both
smart
people
and
they
do
wonderful
work
but
they're
pushing
a
case
that
falls
apart
from
the
sheer
weight
of
its
lunacy
as
though
the
hollywood
community
needs
to
be
purged
of
this
social
and
intellectual
hygiene
problem
called
conservative
thinking
he
laughed
it
underscores
the
fact
that
we
aren't
receptive
to
diversity
of
thought
which
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
you
feel
the
liberal
way
would
be
i
find
that
obscene
you
can
listen
to
the
rest
of
his
marks

the
