he
noted
in
a
facebook
post
friday
when
you
add
it
all
up
i've
been
just
about
called

davis
added
that
a
few
nights
before
he
was
on
a
panel
at
a
philadelphia
conference
that
discussed
ways
to
deescalate
racism
antisemitism
and
violence
in
our
country
but
antifa
wasn't
having
it
meanwhile
antifa
members
threatened
to
do
violence
to
the
conference
organizers
and
panel
speakers
and
burn
down
the
building
where
we
were
to
speak
davis
noted
adding
that
antifa
couldn't
damper
the
mood
during
an
after-party
featuring
a
room
filled
with
people
from
all
walks
of
life
and
every
political
persuasion
from
maga
hat-wearing
trump
supporters
to
supporters
of
those
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
make
america
great
again
people
and
everyone
in
between
we
all
got
along
fantastically
he
said
antifa
was
anything
but
thrilled
davis
said
as
police
closed
streets
surrounding
the
party
while
about
antifa
members
gathered
outside
the
building
to
protest
accusing
the
the
speakers
and
organizers
of
being
racist
more
from

post
here's
a
clip
of
davis
discussing
the
idea
that
those
who
are
against
racism
should
dialogue
with
and
listen
to
and
extend
compassion
toward
those
who
espouse
racism
in
order
to
change
their
hearts
and
minds
here's
another
clip
of
davis
recounting
his
attendance
at

where
he
befriended

members
and
saw
many
of
them
end
their
racism
