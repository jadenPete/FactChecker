tucker
carlson
takes
aim
at
mike
lee
for
flip-flopping
on
google
lee
fires
back
with
facts
antitrust
should
be
about
consumer
welfare
not
politics
during
his
prime
time
show
tuesday
fox
news
host
tucker
carlson
accused
sen
mike
lee
r-utah
of
flip-flopping
his
position
on
antitrust
investigations
into
google
just
a
few
years
ago
that
utah
sen
mike
lee
was
a
persistent
critic
of
google
carlson
said
but
fast
forward
to
today
today
mike
lee
is
one
of
google's
chief
allies
in
congress
maybe
its
biggest
ally
in
the
republican
party
carlson
went
on
to
imply
that
google
bought
lee's
loyalties
through
a
series
of
investments
in
utah
and
a
fundraiser
for
the
utah
senator
on
friday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
disclosed
the
details
of
a
conversation
he
initiated
with
lee
following
carlson's
accusations
i've
told
him
mike
if
you
go
dark
i'm
just
going
to
have
to
just
get
out
of
this
business
because
if
you
go
dark
there's
no
chance
i
mean
you
have
the
best
chance
of
being
that
beacon
we
have
to
have
somebody
that
is
educated
on
the
constitution
and
is
reasonable
rational
isn't
a
fire-bomber
but
holds
true
to
that
constitution
glenn
said
and
so
i
was
really
disturbed
when
i
read
this
story
about
him
flip-flopping
on
google
and
there's
google
payouts
and
everything
else
well
he's
not
a
flip-flopper
if
you
do
your
homework
he
continued
there's
a
big
explanation
a
really
good
explanation
of
what
mike
is
doing
let
me
just
read
a
couple
of
the
emails
that
i
got
from
mike
yesterday
we
have
to
resist
the
impulse
to
conclude
that
because
big
tech
does
some
really
bad
things
that
we
don't
like
that
that
means
that
antitrust
laws
hold
a
remedy
glenn
read
what's
happening
right
now
is
politicians
and
this
is
a
movement
from
the
left
that
what
they
really
want
to
do
is
change
the
way
we
do
antitrust
he
has
made
it
very
clear
for
years
that
antitrust
should
be
about
consumer
welfare
not
politics
glenn
noted
so
if
his
complaint
on
google
is
that
they're
stacking
the
deck
and
they're
pointing
you
to
things
that
they
own
things
that
they
get
kickbacks
on
as
well
as
politics
where
you
can't
find
the
truth
then
that
is
costing
you
more
money
and
so
antitrust
must
be
about
the
consumer
and
consumer's
welfare
but
there
is
this
movement
now
glenn
read
that
the
left
is
trying
to
change
the
antitrust
law
so
that
consumer
welfare
is
no
longer
the
governing
standard
it
seeks
to
jettison
the
modern
evidence-based
focus
on
protecting
competition
in
favor
of
a
long
abandoned
approach
that
bases
antitrust
enforcement
on
purely
political
objectives
we
can't
let
the
antitrust
laws
be
used
by
politicians
even
if
we
agree
i
fear
what
precedent
this
might
set
where
political
lines
might
be
drawn
in
a
business
setting
