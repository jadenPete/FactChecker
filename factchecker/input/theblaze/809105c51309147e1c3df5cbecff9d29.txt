comedian
dave
chappelle
tells
audience
that
if
women
have
a
right
to
kill
their
babies
men
can
abandon

if
i'm
wrong
then
perhaps
we're
wrong
controversial
comedian
dave
chappelle
offered
his
audience
a
profane
and
unusual
take
on
abortion
in
his
newest
netflix
special
sticks
stones
in
a
clip
of
his
special
posted
by
netflix
chappelle
who
is
known
for
challenging
today's
woke
culture
and
not
caring
what
critics
on
the
left
or
right
thing
of
him
began
his
abortion
riff
declaring
i'll
be
real
with
you
and
i
know
nobody
gives
a
f
what
i
think
anyway
i'm
not
for
abortion
at
that
an
audience
member
cheered
to
which
chappelle
replied
oh
shut
up
n
adding
i'm
not
for
it
but
i'm
not
against
it
either
the
setup
he
then
touted
the
usual
lines
most
pro-abortion
advocates
spout
about
the
right
to
abortion
and
the
my
body
my
choice
worldview
that
claims
an
unborn
child
is
nothing
more
than
a
clump
of
cells
to
make
sure
he
had
the
audience
on
the
hook
he
emphasized
the
pro-abortion
crowd's
demand
that
men
should
not
have
a
say
when
it
comes
to
abortion
that
it
is
really
an
issue
only
women
ought
to
be
allowed
to
debate
and
determine
i
don't
care
what
your
religious
beliefs
are
or
anything
chappelle
said
if
you
have
a
d
k
you
need
to
shut
the
f
up
on
this
one
seriously
this
is
theirs
the
right
to
choose
is
their
unequivocal
right
he
continued
not
only
do
i
believe
they
have
the
right
to
choose
i
believe
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
consult
anybody
except
for
a
physician
about
how
they
exercise
that
right
gentlemen
that
is
fair
he
noted
the
executionafter
getting
what
was
apparently
a
largely
pro-abortion
crowd
especially
the
women
in
the
audience
to
cheer
his
recitation
of
pro-abortion
talking
points
chappelle
went
for
the
roundhouse
because
what's
fair
is
fair
ladies
to
be
fair
to
us
i
also
believe
that
if
you
decide
to
have
the
baby
a
man
should
not
have
to
pay
that
is
fair
he
said
which
received
significant
laughter
from
the
men
in
the
crowd
if
you
can
kill
this
motherf
er
i
can
at
least
abandon
em
chappelle
stated
it's
my
money
my
choice
he
added
ripping
off
the
my
body
my
choice
mantra
of
the
pro-abortion
movement
which
earned
him
some
groans
and
oohs
from
the
audience
then
he
offered
a
line
that
just
might
have
caused
an
everyday
abortion
supporter
to
pause
and
if
i'm
wrong
then
perhaps
we're
wrong
so
figure
that
s
t
out
for
yourselves
content
warning
extremely
rough
language
