leftist
activists
publicly
celebrate
the
death
of
libertarian
billionaire
david
koch
absolutely
disgusting
billionaire
political
donor
and
philanthropist
david
koch
passed
away
friday
morning
he
was
a
man
well
known
for
putting
vast
amounts
of
money
behind
causes
to
advance
freedom
and
for
that
he
had
many
political
adversaries
but
several
high-profile
leftist
activists
couldn't
bring
themselves
to
acknowledge
koch's
contributions
to
causes
that
benefitted
people
outside
the
political
realm
or
to
even
allow
the
man's
family
to
grieve
in
the
hours
after
his
death
was
first
announced
a
slew
of
public
figures
including
celebrities
took
to
social
media
to
celebrate
koch's
passing
some
taunted
his
equally-famous
brother
charles
openly
wishing
he
would
be
soon
to
follow
hollywood
actress
bette
midler
proudly
cheered
koch's
death
in
a
series
of
tweets
and
retweets
for
her
million
followers
to
see
i
tweeted
the
sic
charleskoch
had
died
instead
of
davidkochisdead
i'm
sorry
to
give
others
false
hope
guess
it
was
just
wistful
thinking
as
we
watch
the
amazon
rainforest
burning
all
the
globalwarming
culprits
are
foremost
in
one's
mind
midler
then
went
on
to
shame
others
for
paying
respect
to
koch's
memory
in
response
to
a
message
sent
by
the
heritage
foundation's
president
kay
coles
james
midler
wrote
with
all
due
respect
ms
james
f
ck
you
a
friend
of
liberty
yes
his
own
and
his
family's
before
lobbing
more
insults
actor
ron
perlman
reacted
to
koch's
death
by
tweeting
wishing
the
koch
brothers
a
speedy
reunion
perlman
was
confronted
by
conservative
radio
host
dana
loesch
who
informed
him
that
the
koch
brothers
have
championed
social
philosophies
in
line
with
many
on
the
left
and
gave
to
philanthropic
causes
that
transcend
political
bounds
perlman
was
unapologetic
telling
loesch
all
the
good
deeds
there
are
can't
replace
the
lives
lost
that
come
with
peddling
agents
of
death
for
profit
there
are
too
many
to
name
here
but
journalists
authors
filmmakers
and
activists
by
the
hundreds
took
the
opportunity
to
relish
in
the
death
of
a
stranger
they
considered
a
political
foe
the
independent
even
printed
an
op-ed
declaring
koch's
life's
work
was
the
destruction
of
others
anything
else
in
the
sea
of
vitriol
during
friday's
online
display
it
is
noteworthy
that
a
message
of
reason
was
sent
out
from
someone
who
is
typically
on
the
front
lines
of
conservative-bashing
actress
alyssa
milano
took
some
heat
herself
from
fellow
progressives
just
for
tweeting
simply
celebrating
a
man's
death
while
fighting
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
is
a
bad
look
for
democrats
humans
