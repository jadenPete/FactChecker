taylor
swift
used
part
of
her
acceptance
speech
at
the
video
music
awards
to
hit
out
at
the
trump
administration
for
not
acknowledging
her
petition
endorsing
the
house-passed
equality
act
an
initiative
branded
as
a
measure
to
keep
lgbtq
americans
from
being
oppressed

plea
for

on
it
on

the
singer's
wish
was
granted
a
white
house
spokesperson
issued
a
statement
saying
the
trump
administration
absolutely
opposes
discrimination
of
any
kind
and
supports
the
equal
treatment
of
all
however
the
house-passed
bill
in
its
current
form
is
filled
with
poison
pills
that
threaten
to
undermine
parental
and
conscience
rights
fox
news
reported
the
los
angeles
times
noted
that
tuesday's
messaging
from
the
administration
is
familiar
swift
wrote
in
a
letter
to
her
own
senator
lamar
alexander
r-tenn
earlier
this
year
i
personally
reject
the
president's
stance
that
his
administration
supports
equal
treatment
of
all
but
the
equality
act
in
its
current
form
is
filled
with
poison
pills
that
threaten
to
undermine
parental
and
conscience
rights
anything
else
the
washington
examiner's
brad
polumbo
himself
a
gay
conservative
addressed
the
equality
act's
poison
pills
in
an
op-ed
about
what
he
called
swift's
virtue
signaling
published
tuesday
swift
says
the
equality
act
basically
just
says
we
should
all
be
equal
under
the
law
polumbo
wrote
this
is
a
gross
oversimplification
and
insults
the
many
people
including
gay
conservatives
such
as
myself
with
serious
and
substantial
objections
to
the
bill
the
columnist
went
on
to
argue
in
cases
of
competing
rights
claims
the
equality
act
mandates
that
sexual
and
gender
minorities
win
by
default
when
current
standards
under
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
allow
for
a
weighing
of
both
sides
this
doesn't
make
gay
and
transgender
people
equal
it
elevates
their
rights
over
those
of
religious
minorities
