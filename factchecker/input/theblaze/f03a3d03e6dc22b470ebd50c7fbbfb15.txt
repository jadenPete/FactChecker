claims
airplanes
took
aim
at
world
trade
center
on
not
terrorists
the
backlash
is
fierce
this
newspaper
is
garbage
the
new
york
times
ignited
outrage
wednesday
the
th
anniversary
of
the
terrorist
attacks
after
seemingly
blame-shifting
responsibility
for
the
attacks
from
al
qaeda
terrorists
to
the
airplanes
years
have
passed
since
airplanes
took
aim
and
brought
down
the
world
trade
center
the
times
tweeted
today
families
will
once
again
gather
and
grieve
at
the
site
where
more
than
people
died
the
story
which
the
times
tweet
linked
began
what
was
the
reaction
the
times
was
universally
condemned
and
mocked
for
writing
that
planes
took
aim
when
in
reality
al
qaeda
terrorists
hijacked
airplanes
filled
with
hundreds
of
innocent
people
to
weaponize
them
in
an
effort
to
topple
the
world
trade
center's
twin
towers
fortunately
journalists
rallied
to
make
sure
sentient
airplanes
would
be
less
likely
to
kill
ever
again
one
person
said
the
new
york
times
is
so
woke
they
say
airplanes
targeted
the
world
trade
centers
as
opposed
to
muslim
extremists
appalling
especially
on
the
th
anniversary
of
another
person
responded
this
newspaper
is
garbage
radio
host
larry
o'connor
responded
man
those
towers
really
must
have
done
something
to
upset
those
airplanes
one
person
mocked
and
years
later
we
still
somehow
allow
airplanes
to
be
legal
let
that
sink
in
another
mocked
how
did
the
times
respond
the
newspaper
quickly
deleted
the
tweet
and
published
another
to
reflect
that
terrorists
were
in
fact
responsible
for
the
outlet
wrote
that
the
tweet
and
its
story
were
updated
for
clarity
the
second
paragraph
of
the
updated
story
now
reads
eighteen
years
have
passed
since
terrorists
commandeered
airplanes
to
take
aim
at
the
world
trade
center
and
bring
them
down
the
paragraph
is
the
only
paragraph
in
the
story
that
mentions
terrorism
aside
from
the
story's
subheading
which
mentions
terror
attacks
the
story
also
does
not
mention
al
qaeda
the
terrorist
group
behind
the
attacks
