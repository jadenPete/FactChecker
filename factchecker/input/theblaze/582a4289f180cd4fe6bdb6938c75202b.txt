pete
buttigieg
says
it's
a
kind
of
sin
to
deny
global
warming
the
left
loved
him
trying
to
use
religion
against
the
faithful
pete
buttigieg
was
praised
by
many
on
the
left
for
using
religious
language
during
cnn's
climate
change
town
hall
including
the
assertion
that
it
was
a
kind
of
sin
for
skeptics
to
deny
climate
change
let's
talk
in
language
that
is
understood
across
the
heartland
about
faith
said
buttigieg
an
openly
gay
presidential
candidate
you
know
if
you
believe
that
god
is
watching
as
poison
is
being
belched
into
the
air
of
creation
and
people
are
being
harmed
by
it
countries
are
at
risk
of
vanishing
in
low-lying
areas
what
do
you
suppose
god
thinks
of
that
he
asked
rhetorically
i
bet
he
thinks
it's
messed
up
buttigieg
answered
and
you
don't
have
to
be
religious
to
see
the
moral
dimensions
of
this
because
frankly
every
religious
and
non-religious
moral
tradition
tell
us
that
we
have
some
responsibility
of
stewardship
some
responsibility
for
taking
care
of
what's
around
us
he
continued
not
to
mention
taking
care
of
our
neighbor
eventually
it
gets
to
the
point
where
this
is
less
and
less
about
the
planet
as
an
abstract
thing
and
more
and
more
about
specific
people
suffering
specific
harm
because
of
what
we're
doing
right
now
he
added
at
least
one
way
of
talking
about
this
is
that
it's
a
kind
of
sin
buttigieg
concluded
the
south
bend
indiana
mayor
experienced
a
surge
in
polling
early
in
the
nomination
race
but
his
support
has
since
tumbled
back
to
earth
he
is
polling
at
percent
tied
for
fourth
place
in
recent
polling
