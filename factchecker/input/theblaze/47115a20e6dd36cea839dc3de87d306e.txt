new
ad
for
dave
chappelle
comedy
special
strikes
back
at
woke
culture
if
you
say
anything
you
risk
everything
these
days
it's
a
high-stakes
game
as
american
culture
has
grown
hypersensitive
on
both
the
right
and
the
left
the
scope
of
things
people
are
allowed
to
say
has
shrunk
the
move
toward
an
increasingly
woke
society
has
affected
the
nation's
politics
religion
college
campuses
news
reporting
and
entertainment
and
arguably
no
area
in
american
entertainment
has
been
more
negatively
impacted
than
comedy
dave
chappelle
appears
poised
to
respond
to
american
wokeness
with
a
new
netflix
comedy
special
sticks
stones
what's
going
on
in
this
industry
where
once
no
cows
were
sacred
many
masters
of
the
craft
are
lamenting
the
so-called
snowflakes
who
are
making
their
jobs
nigh
impossible
jerry
seinfeld
has
famously
cautioned
fellow
comics
against
playing
college
venues
john
cleese
warned
that
p.c.
culture
will
lead
to
society
kevin
hart
suffered
being
made
an
example
of
when
he
lost
his
gig
hosting
the
oscars
over
comments
a
few
people
found
just
too
offensive
and
those
are
just
a
few
now
chappelle
is
striking
back
based
on
a
new
ad
posted
thursday
for
his
special
he
doesn't
seem
to
care
that
liberal
media
critics
don't
like
his
schtick
particularly
when
it
goes
after
marginalized
groups
like
transgenders
and
think
it's
getting
old
which
is
how
new
york
times
jason
zinoman
described
chappelle's
act
remember
chappelle
is
the
same
guy
who
mocked
the
women
who
were
reportedly
victimized
by
louis
ck
who
masturbated
in
front
of
them
after
getting
their
permission
and
said
that
the
story
made
him
laugh
and
lest
anyone
on
the
right
think
that
his
anti-snowflake
stance
is
aimed
solely
at
over-sensitive
members
of
the
left
he
also
praised
michelle
wolf's
willingness
to
go
after
the
president
and
his
administration
at
the
white
house
correspondents
dinner
and
i
think
that
for
many
people
not
everybody
who
watched
it
but
for
many
people
it's
cathartic
to
watch
that
woman
speak
truth
to
power
like
that
chappelle
told
pbs
news
hour
and
whether
they
understand
it
or
not
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
levity
in
what
she
did
but
it
was
very
flat-footed
and
it
was
grounded
in
her
truth
and
whether
i
agree
with
it
or
not
i
gotta
respect
the
artistry
i
gotta
respect
the
gangsta
this
is
dave
he
tells
jokes
for
a
living
the
new
netflix
ad
voiced
by
legendary
actor
morgan
freeman
reminds
viewers
that
in
today's
culture
a
willingness
to
take
on
the
new
shibboleths
of
the
american
right
and
left
gay
and
straight
white
and
black
can
make
one
an
outcast
but
if
that's
how
it
is
so
be
it
this
is
dave
he
tells
jokes
for
a
living
freeman
says
as
chappelle
walks
across
a
wasteland
hopefully
he
makes
people
laugh
but
these
days
it's
a
high-stakes
game
if
you
say
anything
you
risk
everything
freeman
continues
but
if
that's
the
way
it's
gotta
be
ok
fine
