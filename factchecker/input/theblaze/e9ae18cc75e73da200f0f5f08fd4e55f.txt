could
include
measures
president

trump
has
expressed
support
for
in
recent
weeks
including
red
flag
legislation
stronger
background
checks
and
reforms
surrounding
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
mental
health
conditions
there
have
been
three
recent
mass
killings
that
have
revitalized
the
gun
control
debate
in
two
of
them
the
gunman
was
killed
at
the
scene
critics
of
this
proposed
legislation
have
questioned
whether
the
death
penalty
would
be
a
deterrent
for
criminals
willing
to
commit
a
crime
that
carries
a
high
probability
of
resulting
in
their
death
president
trump

after
seven
were
shot
and
killed
in
odessa
texas

his
remarks
something
he
was
supportive
of
after
the
mass
murders
in
dayton
ohio
and
el
paso
texas
last
month
it
would
be
wonderful
to
say
to
say
eliminate
but
we
want
to
substantially
reduce
the
violent
crime
and
actually
in
any
form
president
trump
said
this
includes
strong
measures
to
keep
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
and
deranged
individuals
and
substantial
reforms
to
our
nation's
broken
mental
health
system
to
reduce
violence
we
must
also
ensure
that
criminals
with
guns
are
put
behind
bars
and
kept
off
the
streets
texas
gov
greg
abbott
pointed
out
that
the
gunman
in
odessa
had
a
criminal
history
and
once
failed
a
background
check
for
a
gun
purchase
in
texas
abbott
said
the
gun
used
in
the
mass
murder
was
obtained
without
a
background
check
