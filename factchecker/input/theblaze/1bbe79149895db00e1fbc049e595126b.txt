he's
alive
today

able
to
tell
you
his
story
for
one
reason
he
needed
help
and
he
reached
out
and
he
wants
you
to
do
the

according
to
former
nypd
psychologist
dr
tom
coghlan
the
department
needs
to
make
major
changes
to
its
wellness
policy
to
address
the
mental
health
treatment
of
its
officers
coghlan
told
si
live
com
that
during
his
year
tenure
at
the
department
officers
who
sought
help
even
on
their
own
accord
through
a
department
psychological
evaluation
feared
losing
career
opportunities
or
facing
punitive
measures
like
a
change
in
command
these
are
human
beings
in
need
of
treatment
who
won't
come
forward
for
help
because
of
the
way
they're
treated
coghlan
told
the
outlet
what
they
need
to
do
is
remove
all
punitive
things
that
come
along
with
being
placed
on
restricted
duty
so
that
cops
will
be
less
afraid
and
hesitant
to
come
forward
voluntarily
