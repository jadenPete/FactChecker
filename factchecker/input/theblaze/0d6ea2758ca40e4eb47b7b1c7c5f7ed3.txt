says
right
wing
terrorists
are
worse
than
islamist
terrorists
who
attacked
on
and
gets
brutal
backlash
weaponized
versions
of
tribalism
motivated
by
fear
cnn's
john
avlon
faced
a
lot
of
backlash
on
social
media
after
a
bizarre
segment
where
he
tried
to
compare
the
attack
on
to
the
threat
of
right
wing
terrorism
on
the
anniversary
of
the
horrible
attack
here's
a
startling
statistic
since
right
wing
terrorists
have
killed
more
people
in
the
united
states
than
jihadist
terrorists
avlon
said
during
the
segment
entitled
reality
check
there
are
some
folks
for
who
their
for
their
own
political
purposes
would
like
to
keep
the
focus
on
only
one
form
of
political
violence
over
another
but
that
would
be
unwise
because
we
don't
have
the
luxury
of
choosing
which
threats
we
face
and
there's
a
case
to
be
made
that
these
threats
actually
echo
each
other
he
continued
as
our
colleague
jim
sciutto
and
others
have
argued
they're
weaponized
versions
of
tribalism
motivated
by
fear
and
finding
identity
in
their
hatred
of
the
other
avlon
said
to
mark
the
th
anniversary
of
is
to
reflect
on
how
we're
all
the
children
of
that
attack
unleashed
destructive
forces
that
we're
still
wrestling
with
avlon
concluded
but
to
truly
learn
the
lessons
of
is
to
resolve
not
to
let
hate
win
or
fear
define
us
here's
the
response
many
critics
on
social
media
replied
that
it
was
tone-deaf
to
try
to
twist
the
meaning
of
the
attacks
on
a
different
kind
of
terrorism
altogether
i
think
johnavlon
was
making
a
legit
point
responded
talk
show
host
erick
erickson
young
lonely
white
dudes
are
radicalizing
online
as
young
muslim
men
have
been
but
i
think
it
is
also
something
best
left
to
say
on
instead
of
cnn
thought
it
was
a
good
on
to
run
a
segment
telling
everyone
the
people
who
murdered
innocent
americans
with
hijacked
airplanes
on
weren't
actually
the
real
threat
said
stephen
miller
becket
adams
opined
at
the
washington
examiner
that
the
statistical
comparison
ignored
the
deaths
from
ironically
that
is
one
hell
of
a
qualifier
to
say
that
right-wingers
are
the
deadliest
as
long
as
you
don't
count
the
deadliest
adams
wrote
i
cannot
be
the
only
one
who
caught
the
irony
of
avlon
citing
a
claim
that
requires
the
exclusion
of
the
death
toll
during
a
segment
that
was
supposed
to
be
about
amnesia
he
added
later
here's
the
video
segment
from
cnn
