thinkprogress
has
been
losing
money
for
years
we
will
only
entertain
serious
proposals
from
publishers

are
genuinely
interested
in
investing
in
thinkprogress
and
supporting
its
mission

executive
director
navin
nayak
told
the
daily
beast
in
july
what
happened
now
given
that
we
could
find
no
new
publisher
we
have
no
other
real
option
but
to
fold
the
thinkprogress
website
back
into
cap's
broader
online
presence
with
a
focus
on
analysis
of
policy
politics
and
news
events
through
the
lens
of
existing

told
staff
according
to
the
daily
beast
conversations
on
how
to
do
so
are
just
beginning
but
we
will
seek
to
reinvent
it
as
a
different
platform
for
progressive
change
the
website
will
now
be
used
to
host
analysis
from
cap's
policy
experts
some
thinkprogress
staffers
were
hired
by
cap
while
others
had
already
found
other
jobs
before
the
announcement
was
made
about
a
dozen
or
so
remaining
employees
of
the
website
will
end
up
losing
their
jobs
although
cap
would
offer
them
a
severance
package
that
would
compensate
them
until
november
and
continue
to
offer
them
health
insurance
until
the
