msnbc
host
lawrence
o'donnell
has
issued
a
tweet
retracting
his
claim
that
president
donald
trump
co-signed
loans
with
russian
oligarchs
o'donnell
called
his
own
reporting
an
error
in
judgment
and
apologized
for
not
going
through
his
network's
rigorous
verification
and
standards
process
i
shouldn't
have
reported
it
and
i
was
wrong
to
discuss
it
on
the
air
he
admitted
i
will
address
the
issue
on
my
show
tonight
trump's
lawyers
had
demanded
that
o'donnell
and
msnbc's
parent
company
nbc
universal
retract
the
story
the
original
story
continues
below
msnbc
host
lawrence
o'donnell
claimed
tuesday
that
president
donald
trump
had
co-signed
foreign
loans
with
russian
oligarchs
only
to
admit
later
that
he
was
unable
to
prove
these
sensational
accusations
what's
the
background
on
tuesday
deutsche
bank
said
in
court
filings
that
it
had
at
least
some
tax
returns
related
to
trump's
family
but
did
not
specify
whose
those
were
democrats
in
congress
have
been
trying
to
subpoena
the
german
bank
in
an
attempt
to
find
incriminating
information
on
the
president
it
was
already
known
that
trump
has
had
dealings
with
deutsche
bank
but
the
bank
has
refused
to
reveal
if
it
has
any
of
trump's
tax
returns
this
is
all
the
information
we
know
for
certain
what
did
o'donnell
claim
on
tuesday
night
o'donnell
told
fellow
msnbc
host
rachel
maddow
that
a
single
source
close
to
deutsche
bank
has
told
me
that
trump
donald
trump's
loan
documents
there
show
that
he
has
co-signers
that's
how
he
was
able
to
obtain
those
loans
and
that
the
co-signers
are
russian
oligarchs
if
true
that
would
explain
every
kind
word
donald
trump
has
ever
said
about
russia
and
vladimir
putin
if
true
he
continued
on
his
own
show
later
that
night
if
true
that
would
be
a
significant
factor
in
vladimir
putin's
publicly
stated
preference
for
presidential
candidate
donald
trump
over
presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton
o'donnell
reiterated
his
claim
in
a
tweet
tuesday
night
which
stated
a
source
close
to
deutsche
bank
says
trump's
tax
returns
show
he
pays
very
little
income
tax
and
more
importantly
that
his
loans
have
russian
co-signers
if
true
that
explains
every
kind
word
trump
has
ever
said
about
russia
and
putin
o'donnell
himself
thought
it
was
worth
reiterating
that
the
accusations
are
unproven
o'donnell
was
correct
in
saying
that
if
true
this
news
would
be
huge
but
his
evidence
was
shaky
enough
that
his
own
decidedly
not
pro-trump
network
was
not
willing
to
get
on
board
with
it
msnbc
producer
michael
del
moro
tweeted
that
deutsche
bank
had
declined
to
comment
on
this
story
and
that
o'donnell's
information
had
come
from
a
single
source
who
has
not
seen
the
bank
records
he
added
nbc
has
not
seen
those
records
and
has
not
yet
been
able
to
verify
the
reporting
at
the
end
of
his
show
on
tuesday
night
o'donnell
admitted
that
the
entire
story
was
based
on
a
single
source
and
had
not
been
confirmed
by
nbc
news
attorney
for
trump
demands
a
retraction
in
a
letter
dated
wednesday
attorney
charles
j
harder
whose
firm
represents
trump
and
the
trump
organization
demanded
that
o'donnell
immediately
and
prominently
retract
correct
and
apologize
for
the
aforementioned
false
and
defamatory
statements
harder
promised
immediate
legal
proceedings
against
mr
o'donnell
and
nbcu
if
these
demands
were
not
met
