ted
cruz
says
the
deep
state
might
be
behind
firing
of
john
bolton
from
trump
admin
here's
why
the
texas
senator
has
some
concerns
sen
ted
cruz
r-texas
wondered
aloud
on
social
media
if
the
exit
of
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
from
the
trump
administration
is
the
result
of
machinations
by
the
deep
state
cruz
aired
his
suspicions
from
his
twitter
account
john
bolton
is
a
friend
and
he
has
devoted
his
life
to
defending
our
national
security
including
providing
wise
counsel
to
multiple
administrations
he
tweeted
i
sincerely
hope
his
leaving
the
white
house
does
not
mean
that
the
deep-state
forces
at
state
and
treasury
who
have
been
fighting
tooth
and
nail
to
preserve
the
obama
iran
nuclear
deal
have
finally
convinced
the
president
to
go
soft
on
iran
he
added
the
deep
state
is
the
phrase
used
by
allies
of
president
donald
trump
to
describe
a
secret
group
of
anti-trump
activists
in
the
government
that
is
allegedly
using
their
power
to
undermine
his
policies
bolton
was
unceremoniously
fired
on
tuesday
through
a
pair
of
tweets
from
the
president
that
stunned
many
bolton
responded
by
tweeting
his
own
version
of
what
happened
in
contrast
to
the
president's
version
cruz's
comments
were
in
stark
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
sen
rand
paul
r-ky
who
unleashed
a
torrent
of
criticism
against
bolton
and
his
naive
neo-con
foreign
policy
ideals
as
he
described
them
you
need
to
try
to
further
the
president's
agenda
my
opinion
is
that
i
saw
john
bolton
working
against
the
president's
agenda
paul
said
he
had
his
own
agenda
he
concluded
here's
more
about
bolton's
exit
