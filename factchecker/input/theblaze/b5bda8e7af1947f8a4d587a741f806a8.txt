the
department
of
justice's
office
of
inspector
general
has
released
a
report
that
says
that
former
fbi
director
james
comey
set
a
dangerous
example
for
others
at
the
fbi
comey
took
the
same
report
and
demanded
that
his
critics
apologize
what
did
the
report
say
the
report
which
is
publicly
available
and
was
released
thursday
looked
at
a
number
of
memos
that
comey
wrote
while
he
still
worked
at
the
fbi
in
which
he
memorialized
seven
one-on-one
interactions
that
he
had
with
president-elect
and
president
donald
j.
trump
comey
took
four
of
these
memos
out
of
the
fbi's
facilities
and
kept
them
in
his
personal
safe
at
home
after
he
was
fired
some
of
these
memos
included
information
that
the
fbi
later
determined
to
be
either
confidential
or
for
official
use
only
while
the
report
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
comey
or
his
attorneys
released
any
of
the
classified
information
contained
in
any
of
the
memos
to
members
of
the
media
it
was
also
highly
critical
of
the
actions
of
the
former
director
former
director
comey
failed
to
live
up
to
his
responsibility
by
not
safeguarding
sensitive
information
obtained
during
the
course
of
his
fbi
employment
and
by
using
it
to
create
public
pressure
for
action
comey
set
a
dangerous
example
for
the
over
current
fbi
employees
and
the
many
thousands
more
former
fbi
employees
who
similarly
have
access
to
or
knowledge
of
non-public
information
comey
said
he
was
compelled
to
take
these
actions
if
i
love
this
country
and
i
love
the
department
of
justice
and
i
love
the
fbi
however
were
current
or
former
fbi
employees
to
follow
the
former
director's
example
and
disclose
sensitive
information
in
service
of
service
of
their
own
strongly
held
personal
convictions
the
fbi
would
be
unable
to
dispatch
its
law
enforcement
duties
properly
as
comey
himself
noted
in
his
march
congressional
testimony
the
report
also
details
how
comey
instructed
others
to
give
the
memos
he
had
created
to
the
new
york
times
the
ig
said
that
if
comey
was
actually
trying
to
advocate
for
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
like
he
had
claimed
he
had
several
other
lawful
options
available
to
him
what
did
comey
say
ignoring
the
report's
scathing
conclusion
comey
tweeted
out
the
line
that
said
the
inspector
general
had
found
no
evidence
that
comey
or
his
attorneys
released
any
of
the
classified
information
contained
in
any
of
the
memos
to
members
of
the
media
i
don't
need
a
public
apology
from
those
who
defamed
me
he
quipped
but
a
quick
message
with
a
sorry
we
lied
about
you
would
be
nice
he
also
accused
anyone
who
had
called
him
a
liar
and
a
leaker
of
trusting
people
who
gave
you
bad
info
