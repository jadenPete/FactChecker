texas
school
district
takes
harsh
action
against
student
over
old
photo
of
student
holding
handgun
firearm
hysteria
the
iola
independent
school
district
in
texas
is
disciplining
a
student
after
an
old
photo
showing
that
student
with
a
handgun
resurfaced
on
social
media
investigators
said
the
year-old
photo
which
surfaced
on
facebook
on
aug
shows
the
unidentified
teenager
holding
a
handgun
with
an
adult
present
when
he
was
years
old
kbtx-tv
reported
the
social
media
post
also
reportedly
mentioned
the
word
school
so
last
week
on
just
the
second
day
of
the
new
school
year
the
student
was
questioned
about
the
photo
law
enforcement
then
said
there
was
no
threat
iola
isd
superintendent
scott
martindale
told
kbtx
the
sole
issue
was
that
the
picture
had
a
caption
using
the
word
school
although
it
was
not
used
in
a
threatening
manner
it
was
a
young
student
had
a
handgun
in
the
picture
and
part
of
the
wording
on
the
picture
it
had
the
word
school
in
it
so
we
take
that
stuff
very
seriously
here
as
we
investigated
we
found
out
the
picture
was
a
four-year-old
picture
martindale
said
the
picture
had
a
caption
that
mentioned
school
it
did
not
threaten
the
school
whatsoever
it
just
mentioned
the
school
grimes
county
sheriff
lt
daniel
wagnon
claimed
there
was
sufficient
cause
for
concern
and
the
investigation
was
necessary
the
issue
was
not
that
the
juvenile
had
a
firearm
he
was
under
adult
supervision
at
the
time
he
had
the
firearm
the
sole
reason
for
the
investigation
was
that
the
comment
was
made
about
the
school
in
conjunction
with
a
firearm
he
told
kbtx
however
despite
never
bringing
a
weapon
onto
campus
nor
breaking
any
law
martindale
said
the
student
will
still
be
disciplined
according
to
district
policy
