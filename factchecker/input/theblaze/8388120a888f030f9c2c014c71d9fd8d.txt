viral

circulates
online
hi
there
we
don't
know
where
this
information
came
from
the
social
media
outrage
mob
targeted
olive
garden
with
calls
for
a
boycott
on
sunday
over
already
debunked
claims
related
to
president
donald
trump's
reelection
efforts
the
outrage
began
after
twitter
user
dennese
edgerton
claimed
olive
garden
is
funding
trump's
re-election
the
tweet
quickly
went
viral
amassing
more
than
shares
by

sunday
evening
the
hashtag
boycottolivegarden
trended
on
social
media
olive
garden
attempted
to
quell
frustrations
by
responding
to
hundreds
of
tweets
rebuking
the
restaurant
chain
for
allegedly
supporting
trump
in
other
messages
olive
garden
stated
unequivocally
that
darden
the
parent
company
that
owns
olive
garden
and
other
restaurants
like
longhorn
steakhouse
and
cheddar's
does
not
donate
to
federal
candidates
it's
not
exactly
clear
why
the
boycott
went
viral
over
the
weekend
but
just
a
few
weeks
ago
a
college
student's
tweet
claiming
that
olive
garden
is
among
a
dozen
popular
restaurant
chains
supporting
trump's
reelection
went
viral
a
verified
account
connected
to
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
also
spread
the
misinformation
as
did
model
chrissy
teigen
however
as
the
washington
post's
philip
bump
reported
the
tweet's
claims
are
not
true
for
consumer
activists
looking
to
put
their
money
where
their
politics
are
though
some
bad
news
the
college
student
is
broadly
wrong
about
those
companies
bump
wrote
it
turns
out
the
student
conflated
assessments
of
the
politics
of
the
company
broadly
with
direct
political
spending
citing
data
from
the
center
for
responsive
politics
despite
a
disclaimer
stating
the
data
do
not
reflect
direct
organizational
donations
the
organizations
themselves
did
not
donate
rather
the
money
came
from
the
organizations
pacs
their
individual
members
or
employees
or
owners
and
those
individuals
immediate
families
