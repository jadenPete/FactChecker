court
reverses
sole
conviction
in
the
death
of
kate
steinle
her
killer
was
already
acquitted
on
murder
charges
the
single
conviction
handed
down
in
the
death
of
kate
steinle
who
was
shot
to
death
by
an
illegal
immigrant
on
a
san
francisco
pier
in
has
been
overturned
by
a
california
appeals
court
what
are
the
details
five-times
deported
mexican
national
jose
inez
garcia-zarate
admitted
to
killing
steinle
but
claimed
it
was
an
accident
that
occurrent
when
he
inadvertently
picked
up
the
firearm
he
says
was
wrapped
in
a
t-shirt
on
the
ground
and
it
went
off
no
one
disputes
that
garcia-zarate
held
the
gun
that
fired
the
shot
that
killed
steinle
and
no
one
disputes
that
the
bullet
ricocheted
off
a
curb
before
hitting
the
year-old
woman
who
was
walking
with
her
father
prosecutors
claimed
garcia-zarate
aimed
at
steinle
but
his
ineptitude
caused
the
bullet
to
ricochete
yet
he
still
hit
his
target
the
defense
claims
the
man
held
the
gun
only
for
a
moment
and
the
entire
tragedy
was
an
unfortunate
accident
in
november
a
jury
found
garcia-zarate
not
guilty
of
murder
but
did
convict
him
of
felony
possession
of
a
weapon
that
sole
conviction
was
thrown
out
by
the
first
district
court
of
appeal
on
friday
the
associated
press
reported
because
the
judge
failed
to
give
the
jury
the
option
of
acquitting
garcia-zarate
on
the
theory
he
only
possessed
the
weapon
for
a
moment
garcia-zarate's
lawyer
told
the
outlet
that
this
doesn't
mean
it's
all
over
the
district
attorney
has
the
option
of
re-trying
garcia-zarate
on
that
charge
again
that
kind
of
error
causes
reversals
all
the
time
said
attorney
tony
serra
then
the
prosecution
has
the
prerogative
of
going
again
anything
else
friday's
verdict
is
another
blow
to
the
grieving
steinle
family
who
has
fought
ever
since
kate's
death
to
find
justice
earlier
this
year
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
upheld
a
lower
court's
decision
to
dismiss
her
loved
ones
wrongful
death
suit
against
the
city
of
san
francisco
for
its
role
in
granting
sanctuary
status
to
her
killer
