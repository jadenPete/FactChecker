the
students
opposing

have
banded
together
and
and
created
a
facebook
page
rally
to
stop
sean
spicer
at
neiu
to
demonstrate
their
opposition
to
his
presence
at
least
people
have
issued
an
rsvp
to
the
event
at
the
time
of
this
writing
neiu
should
not
provide
a
home
for
white
nationalism
and
other
forms
of
bigotry
the
group
rails
as
members
of
racial
ethnic
and
religious
minorities
as
queer
people
trans
and
non-binary
people
and
women
as
undocumented
students
and
as
allies
to
all
of
these
oppressed
groups
we
wish
to
explicitly
express
our
fear
in
the
face
of
escalating
right-wing
violence
in
this
country
and
around
the
world
the
group
continues
we
see
the
policies
and
rhetoric
of
the
trump
administration
including
the
role
spicer
took
early
in
this
administration
as
drivers
of
this
violence
in
august
the
student
government
association
held
a
town
hall
where
students
and
faculty
were
able
to
freely
express
their
fears
over
spicer's
appearance
on
campus
one
student
said
i'm
jewish
i
see
a
lot
of
people
in
the
space
who
are
targets
not
just
of
trump
but
of
the
rising
white
supremacist
violence
that's
happening
in
our
country
right
now
that
makes
me
really
scared
you
give
these
people
who
push
violent
policies
like
concentration
camps
like
a
border
wall
like
a
muslim
ban
coverage
the
student
continued
and
when
you
give
these
people
coverage
on
any
platform
large
or
small
i
think
that
encourages
violence
and
helps
make
their
ability
to
grow
that
much
better
another
student
identified
by
the
school
newspaper
as
an
undocumented
student
said
that
she
was
unhappy
the
university
would
allow
such
a
person
on
campus
to
attack
her
in
her
safe
space
what
else
daniel
l.
goodwin
of
the
daniel
l.
goodwin
distinguished
lecture
series
which
is
holding
the
event
featuring
spicer
and
brazile
told
the
chicago
tribune
that
he
flat-out
refused
to
cave
to
the
outrage
demand
for
the
past
few
years
i've
made
donations
to
cover
the
costs
of
speaking
fees
for
visiting
lecturers
he
said
as
part
of
the
lecturer
series
other
guests
have
included
mary
matalin
and
james
carville
bob
woodward
and
carl
bernstein
terry
savage
erin
brockovich
and
jackie
joyner-kersee
no
university
funds
are
involved
goodwin
also
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
exchanging
free
ideas
in
an
open
space
such
as
a
college
forum
as
a
proponent
of
higher
education
and
learning
i
believe
encouraging
an
atmosphere
that
creates
a
free
exchange
of
ideas
from
a
variety
of
individuals
with
differing
backgrounds
and
divergent
viewpoints
is
critical
to
a
student's
learning
experience
even
if
not
everyone
is
comfortable
with
that
he
added
