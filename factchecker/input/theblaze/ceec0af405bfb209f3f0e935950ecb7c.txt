and
that
the
case
is
covered
by
the

shot
as
espinoza
tried
to
gain
entry
police
told
the
station
what
else
did
the
state's
attorney
have
to
say
from
the
mindset
of
the
dorseys
it's
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
there's
a
shirtless
man
who's
demanding
to
be
let
in
and
will
not
go
away
gibson
told
wjz
gibson
added
to
the
station
that
he
believes
espinoza
mistook
dorsey's
home
for
his
friend's
home
and
thought
he
was
being
pranked
it
is
clear
that
there
was
no
crime
that
occurred
although
there
was
a
terrible
loss
of
life

added

the
espinoza
family
and
their
attorneys
for
two
hours
tuesday
to
explain
the
decision
not
to
charge
dorsey
wjz
said
dorsey's
lawyer
said
in
a
statement
to
wjz
several
days
after
the
shooting
that
it
was
a
defense
of
last
resort
