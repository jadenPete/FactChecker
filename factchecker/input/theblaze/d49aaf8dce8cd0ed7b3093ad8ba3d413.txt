lgbtq
agenda
i
first
want
to
say
thank
you
to
the
fans
because
in
this
video
several
points
were
made
so
you
voting
for
this
video
means
that
you
want
a
world
where
we're
all
treated
equally
under
the
law
regardless
of
who
we
are
regardless
of
how
we
identify
swift
said
at
the
end
of
this
video
there
was
a
petition
and
there
still
is
a
petition
for
the
equality
act
which
basically
just
says
we
all
deserve
equal
rights
under
the
law
the
pop
star
continued
i
want
to
thank
everyone
who
signed
that
petition
because
it
now
has
half-a-million
signatures
which
is
five
times
the
amount
that
it
would
need
to
warrant
a
response
from
the
white
house
she
said
as
swift
discussed
the
petition
and
the
non-response
from
the
white
house
she
looked
down
at
her
wrist
to
reference
a
watch
she
was
not
wearing
one
and
looked
up
with
a
face
of
disgust
the
reaction
won
swift
an
enormous
applause
from
the
audience
president
donald
trump
and
the
white
house
have
not
responded

her
in

to
now
