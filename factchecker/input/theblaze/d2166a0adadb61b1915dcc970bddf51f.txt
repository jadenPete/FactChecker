despite

presidential
election
hillary
clinton
is
taking
an
active
role
in
the
presidential
contest
clinton
is
reportedly
advising
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
one
of
the
top
contenders
for
the
democratic
nomination
the
two
women
have
remained
in
steady
contact
since
warren
launched
her
campaign
in
february
nbc
news
reported
however
according
to
nbc
it's
not
clear
how
often
the
two
communicate
because
both
sides
do
not
want
to
discuss
the
communication
nbc
reported
before
the
democratic
race
kicked
off
earlier
this
year
clinton
privately
met
with
a
number
of
democrats
including
warren
and
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
who
sought
her
support
and
endorsement
there's
no
doubt
that
securing
clinton's
exclusive
support
would
provide
a
boon
for
warren
a
far-left
progressive
who
may
have
trouble
earning
the
trust
of
moderate
democrats
the
exact
people
who
supported
clinton
a
democratic
strategist
confirmed
to
nbc
that
clinton
is
impressed
with
warren's
campaign
so
far
she
has
applauded
her
about
being
serious
and
disciplined
and
loves
that
she
is
sticking
to
her
guns
the
strategist
said
indeed
warren
is
gaining
momentum
heading
into
winter
as
the
contest
nears
the
iowa
caucuses
according
to
realclearpolitics
warren
has
now
overtaken
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
as
the
second-best
democrat
although
joe
biden
remains
the
far
and
away
front-runner
