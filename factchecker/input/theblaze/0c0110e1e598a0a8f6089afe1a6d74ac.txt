hears
plan
to
use
data
from
google
and
apple
to
detect
mental
illness
prevent
gun
violence
it
was
reportedly
well-received
the
trump
administration
heard
a
proposal
last
week
to
create
an
agency
that
would
use
data
from
devices
like
the
apple
watch
amazon
echo
or
google
home
to
identify
signs
of
mental
illness
that
could
lead
to
violent
behavior
according
to
the
washington
post
the
proposal
comes
from
the
suzanne
wright
foundation
a
nonprofit
that
advocates
for
the
use
of
federal
resources
and
private
sector
tools
to
develop
methods
of
detecting
health
problems
earlier
for
more
effective
treatment
the
proposal
calls
for
the
creation
of
the
health
advanced
research
projects
agency
harpa
under
the
umbrella
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
the
main
project
discussed
for
this
new
agency
would
be
the
safe
home
project
stopping
aberrant
fatal
events
by
helping
overcome
mental
extremes
the
aberrant
fatal
events
most
relevant
right
now
are
of
course
mass
shootings
and
the
administration
has
been
exploring
options
to
prevent
them
with
the
safe
home
project
common
consumer
technologies
such
as
the
apple
watch
google
home
and
amazon
echo
all
of
which
have
the
capability
of
collecting
immense
and
sometimes
concerning
levels
of
personal
data
could
be
used
to
produce
an
early
diagnosis
of
neuropsychiatric
violence
geoffrey
ling
a
lead
adviser
for
harpa
said
the
data
collection
would
be
voluntary
everybody
would
be
a
volunteer
ling
told
reporters
according
to
the
daily
caller
we're
not
inventing
new
science
here
we're
analyzing
it
so
we
can
develop
new
approaches
the
trump
administration
has
not
commented
publicly
on
this
proposal
although
the
post
cited
sources
saying
president
trump
received
it
favorably
the
president
has
focused
on
mental
illness
as
a
leading
cause
of
recent
mass
murders
there
is
no
doubt
that
addressing
this
issue
helps
the
president
deal
with
two
issues
he
has
yet
to
find
real
success
on
one
is
the
health
care
front
and
one
is
on
the
gun
violence
front
a
source
familiar
with
the
discussions
told
the
post
theblaze
has
reached
out
to
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
for
comment
but
as
of
publication
has
not
received
a
response
