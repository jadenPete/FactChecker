issues
an
astounding
compliment
to
china's
leaders
and
ted
cruz
shuts
him
down
in
fairness
to
china
and
its
leadership
many
were
astounded
at
the
compliment
that
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
delivered
to
china
and
its
economy
in
the
midst
of
political
turmoil
surrounding
the
crackdown
on
political
dissidents
in
hong
kong
the
presidential
candidate
made
the
comments
during
an
interview
with
the
hill
tv
but
what
we
have
to
say
about
china
in
fairness
to
china
and
its
leadership
is
if
i'm
not
mistaken
they
have
made
more
progress
in
addressing
extreme
poverty
than
any
country
in
the
history
of
civilization
sanders
said
ok
so
they've
done
a
lot
of
things
for
their
people
he
concluded
the
caveat
came
after
he
denied
that
china
was
a
threat
to
the
american
worker
what
is
your
view
of
china
today
do
you
believe
china
represents
an
existential
threat
to
the
american
worker
asked
krystal
ball
no
sanders
responded
i
wouldn't
use
the
word
existential
threat
you
know
he
continued
i
think
china
is
a
country
that
is
moving
unfortunately
in
a
more
authoritarian
way
in
a
number
of
directions
we
would
have
hoped
that
they
would
move
toward
a
democratic
a
more
democratic
form
of
government
they're
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
among
the
many
critics
of
sanders
assessment
of
the
success
of
chinese
economics
was
sen
ted
cruz
r-texas
sure
the
chinese
communists
have
wrongfully
imprisoned
tortured
millions
and
they
have
murdered
over
million
people
but
bernie
may
have
a
point
when
you're
dead
your
poverty's
solved
right
he
tweeted
sarcastically
here's
the
video
of
sanders
