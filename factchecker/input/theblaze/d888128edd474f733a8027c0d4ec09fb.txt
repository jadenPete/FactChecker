pro-life
billboard
defaced
but
vandals
may
have
created
more
powerful
anti-abortion
message
oops
a
pro-life
billboard
in
chicago
was
defaced
recently
but
it
turns
out
the
vandals
handiwork
may
have
created
an
even
more
powerful
anti-abortion
message
eric
j.
scheidler
of
the
pro-life
action
league
noted
in
a
facebook
post
friday
that
his
group
held
a
face
the
truth
tour
stop
at
fullerton
and
ashland
and
saw
the
beautiful
pro-life
billboard
looking
down
on
us
sometime
afterward
he
said
the
billboard
was
vandalized
the
billboard
announced
that
a
baby's
heartbeat
can
be
detected
days
after
conception
and
that
a
baby
is
a
baby
born
and
unborn
there's
also
a
contact
phone
number
along
with
the
group
name
which
appears
to
be
prolife
across
america
based
on
a
similar
billboard
that
went
up
in
utah
earlier
this
summer
the
vandals
used
what
appears
to
be
black
spray
paint
to
cross
out
the
word
unborn
as
well
as
the
organization's
phone
number
the
culprits
also
crossed
out
part
of
the
organization's
name
so
it
reads
prolife
ruins
lives
arguably
the
most
striking
aspect
of
the
billboard
is
the
face
of
the
infant
who's
swaddled
in
a
blanket
and
appears
to
be
sleeping
the
vandals
took
it
upon
themselves
to
write
the
phrase
my
body
my
choice
over
the
infant's
face
extreme
irony
but
lifesitenews
noted
the
extreme
irony
of
the
ugly
spray-painted
words
on
the
baby's
beautiful
face
as
they
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
baby
is
declaring
ownership
of
his
or
her
body
and
not
the
mother
nor
anyone
else
can
claim
that
right
and
that
it's
the
baby's
choice
to
continue
living
the
baby
has
her
own
brain
heart
dna
that
is
completely
distinct
from
those
of
the
mother
the
outlet
added
in
fact
the
mother
and
baby
may
have
different
blood
types
and
if
the
mother
is
pregnant
with
a
male
child
then
certainly
his
organ
of
reproduction
can
in
no
way
be
the
mother's
body
lifesitenews
added
that
the
graffiti
shows
how
utterly
unconvincing
how
absurd
is
the
claim
that
the
baby's
body
is
somehow
the
mother's
body
