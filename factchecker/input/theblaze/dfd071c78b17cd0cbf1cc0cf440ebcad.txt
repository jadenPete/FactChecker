he
recorded

brees
said
you're
not
alone
allies
of
the
lgbtq
agenda
excoriated
brees
on
social
media
robert
littal
of
black
sports
online
called
the
group
a
known
racist
discriminatory
religious
cult
and
an
anti-gay
religious
cult
that
believes
in
conversion
therapy
fights
against
any
anti-discrimination
laws
deadspin
ran
the
headline
drew
brees
appears
in
video
for
gay
conversion
therapy
sickos
doesn't
understand
what
the
big
deal
is
for
the
story
others
on
twitter
accused
brees
of
being
a
bigot
and
aligned
with
a
hateful
group
brees
responded
to
the
online
furor
through
a
video
on
his
instagram
trying
to
clear
the
air
and
saying
that
he
was
falsely
smeared
by
a
deceptive
article
on
the
story
brees
said
that
he
lived
by
the
credo
to
love
all
respect
all
and
accept
all
what
i
did
was
i
filmed
a
video
recently
that
was
encouraging
kids
to
bring
their
bibles
to
school
for
national
bring
your
bible
to
school
day
said
brees
so
i'm
not
sure
why
the
negativity
spread
or
why
people
tried
to
rope
me
into
certain
negativity
he
added
i
do
not
support
any
groups
that
discriminate
or
that
have
their
own
agendas
that
are
trying
to
promote
inequality
ok
so
hopefully
that
has
set
the
record
straight
and
we
can
all
move
on
because
that
is
not
what
i
stand
for
