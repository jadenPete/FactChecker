cnn
calls
out
kamala
harris
for
false
claim
that
she
sued
exxonmobil
in
fact
she
never
sued
that
particular
oil
company
cnn
found
that
presidential
hopeful
sen
kamala
harris's
claim
from
wednesday
that
she
sued
exxonmobil
was
completely
false
what's
the
background
during
cnn's
seven-hour-long
climate
town
hall
on
wednesday
harris
was
asked
by
an
audience
member
about
whether
she'd
take
on
big
businesses
to
advance
an
environmental
agenda
she
said
that
like
with
the
tobacco
companies
years
earlier
people
who
profit
off
of
harmful
behaviors
when
you
take
away
that
money
because
you
take
them
to
court
and
sue
them
as
i
have
done
it's
extraordinary
how
they
will
change
behaviors
they
have
to
be
held
accountable
and
maybe
this
is
the
prosecutor
in
me
they
have
to
be
held
accountable
these
are
bad
behaviors
she
then
criticized
president
donald
trump
and
the
republican
party
for
not
targeting
these
companies
so
sen
harris
what
would
you
do
would
you
sue
them
town
hall
host
and
cnn
anchor
erin
burnett
asked
yes
harris
responded
would
you
sue
exxonmobil
i
have
sued
exxonmobil
harris
quickly
shot
back
with
a
laugh
applause
ensued
it
was
a
great
comeback
that
got
a
great
response
unfortunately
for
harris
it
was
also
not
true
what
did
cnn
say
in
its
fact
check
of
harris
cnn
noted
that
while
harris
had
sued
other
energy
companies
and
had
started
an
investigation
into
exxonmobil
while
she
was
attorney
general
of
california
her
claim
at
the
town
hall
was
that
she
sued
exxonmobil
in
particular
and
it
is
false
what
did
harris's
campaign
say
on
twitter
harris
campaign
press
secretary
ian
sam
responded
to
a
tweet
on
this
topic
by
cnn
reporter
daniel
dale
one
of
the
people
behind
the
network's
fact
check
trump
spent
the
morning
potentially
illegally
teasing
out
jobs
numbers
and
lying
about
a
massive
hurricane's
trajectory
but
sure
let's
spend
our
time
on
whether
as
attorney
general
kamala
sued
vs
investigated
exxon
sams
wrote
she
won
m
for
california
suing
oil
companies
he
then
posted
links
examples
on
california's
department
of
justice
website
of
instances
where
harris
had
sued
chevron
bp
phillips
and
conocophillips
during
her
time
as
attorney
general
of
the
state
sams
had
also
referred
cnn's
fact
checkers
to
her
investigation
into
exxonmobil
