eric
bolling
exposes
rashida
tlaib
and
ilhan
omar
as
fame
hustlers
the
mess
of
fiction
over
fact
about
their
declined
trip
to
isreal
last
week
eric
bolling
asked
when
a
person
crosses
a
racial
line
or
not
when
is
something
racist
or
not
eric
addressed
the
inconvenient
truth
about
rep
rashida
tlaib
and
rep
ilhan
omar
and
their
claim
that
israel
banned
them
from
entering
eric
asserted
that
wearing
a
blackface
and
using
the
n-word
is
racist
for
sure
but
some
things
are
not
so
cut
and
dry
is
it
racist
to
wear
a
sombrero
on
cinco
de
mayo
eric
asked
is
it
racist
for
elizabeth
warren
to
claim
she
is
cherokee
indian
according
to
eric
neither
wearing
a
sombrero
on
cinco
de
mayo
nor
elizabeth
warren
claiming
to
be
cherokee
indian
are
examples
of
racism
however
some
believe
the
opposite
to
be
accurate
so
eric
will
not
be
wearing
a
sombrero
on
may
eric
explained
that
for
some
a
racial
gray
line
does
exist
however
not
so
gray
is
the
line
of
what
is
and
is
not
anti-semitism
when
it
comes
to
two
democratic
congresswomen
rep
rashida
tlaib
and
rep
ilhan
omar
have
pole-vaulted
over
the
gray
line
of
anti-semitism
eric
said
he
explained
that
tlaib
and
omar
were
invited
to
join
other
democratic
members
of
congress
on
a
fact-finding
mission
in
israel
one
week
before
claims
of
israel
denying
entry
made
headlines
eric
explained
how
the
two
congresswomen
sought
travel
to
israel
in
support
a
terrorist
group
on
a
mission
to
ultimately
tank
israel's
economy
you
had
to
see
the
mess
of
fiction
over
fact
it
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
eric
said
he
went
on
to
call
the
two
congresswomen
fame
hustlers
for
jumping
to
defend
palestine
over
our
only
ally
in
the
