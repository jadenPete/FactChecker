specifically
to

and
another
to
the
e
street
group
llc
progressive
consulting

worked

openly
used
the

claimed
that
i
t
appears
that
respondent
mynett's

as
reported
by
ilhan
for
congress
may
have
been
unrelated
or
only
partially
related
to
omar's
campaign
if
ilhan
for
congress
reimbursed
mynett's
llc
for
travel
so
that
rep
omar
would
have
the
benefit
of
mynett's
romantic
companionship
the
expenditures
must
be
considered
personal
in
nature
to
back
up
these
accusations
the
nlpc
provided
publicly
available
records
that
prove
that
omar's
campaign
did
business
with
the
e
street
group
along
with
beth
mynett's
petition
for
divorce
which
includes
her
claim
that
her
husband
had
admitted
to
this
alleged

is
also
trying
to
get
full
custody

on
tuesday
omar
denied
the

she
replied
when
asked
if
she
was
dating
anyone
in

and
like
i
have
said
yesterday
i
have
no
interest
in
really
allowing
the
conversation
about
my
personal
life
to
continue
and
so
i
have
no
desire
to
discuss
it
she
said
she
would
prefer
to
focus
on
her
three
beautiful
little
children
her
family
and
doing
the
work
that
i
feel
i
was
destined
to
do
