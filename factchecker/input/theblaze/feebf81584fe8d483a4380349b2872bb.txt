experts
working
for
google
announced
thursday
that
they
had
discovered
a
security
flaw
in
apple's
iphones
that
had
left
them
vulnerable
for
the
past
two
years
apple
has
since
fixed
the
problem
in
a
series
of
very
technical
blog
posts
google
project
zero
explained
exactly
what
those
glitches
were
with
this
glitch
iphone
users
who
accessed
a
small
collection
of
hacked
websites
through
their
devices
gave
hackers
the
ability
to
see
their
private
messages
on
whatsapp
telegram
imessage
and
gmail
as
well
as
photos
and
the
user's
current
location
the
implant
has
access
to
almost
all
of
the
personal
information
available
on
the
device
which
it
is
able
to
upload
unencrypted
to
the
attacker's
server
project
zero's
threat
analysis
group
said
according
to
cnbc
the
implant
binary
does
not
persist
on
the
device
if
the
phone
is
rebooted
then
the
implant
will
not
run
until
the
device
is
re-exploited
when
the
user
visits
a
compromised
site
again
given
the
breadth
of
information
stolen
the
attackers
may
nevertheless
be
able
to
maintain
persistent
access
to
various
accounts
and
services
by
using
the
stolen
authentication
tokens
from
the
keychain
even
after
they
lose
access
to
the
device
the
flaw
in
the
software
that
made
the
iphones
vulnerable
were
fixed
in
february
but
it
could
have
potentially
exposed
the
data
of
thousands
every
week
project
zero
only
revealed
the
details
of
how
hackers
could
have
exploited
this
security
glitch
months
after
first
alerting
apple
