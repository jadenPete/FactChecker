deputies
often
use
ac
dc's
hells
bells
to
clear
stubborn
bison
off
yellowstone
roads
what
are
the
details
on
tuesday
the
gallatin
county
sheriff's
office
shared
a
post
that
has
since
gone
viral
the
post
read
being
a
deputy
around
west
yellowstone
comes
with
unusual
duties
including
herding
bison
off
the
highway
so
no
one
gets
hurt
when
deputies
respond
to
a
bison
on
the
road
they
turn
on
lights
and
siren
and
encourage
the
animal
to
leave
the
road
with
an
air
horn
with
a
reluctant
bison
they've
been
known
to
play
ac
dc's
hell's
bells
over
the
speakers
that
usually
seems
to
work
the
post
concluded
according
to
usa
today
bison
blocking
the
roads
is
actually
more
of
an
inconvenience
than
it
sounds
the
outlet
reports
that
bison
can
often
leave
drivers
stranded
for
minutes
or
longer
while
waiting
for
the
extremely
large
animals
to
clear
the
road
on
their
own
the
outlet
writes
the
iconic
critters
are
encountered
outside
the
park
too
and
local
motorists
can
attest
that
it's
sometimes
difficult
to
persuade
a
to
pound
bison
to
let
traffic
pass
tourists
are
told
to
remain
inside
their
vehicles
while
near
bison
because
the
enormous
animals
are
surprisingly
fast
and
unpredictable
