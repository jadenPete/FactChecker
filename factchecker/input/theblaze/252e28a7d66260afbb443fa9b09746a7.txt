texas
man
turns
in
legally
owned
ak-
to
police
in
response
to
recent
shootings
claims
it
takes
courage
in
staged
news
event
we
need
to
get
them
off
the
streets
in
a
move
that
seemed
to
confuse
even
the
police
officer
who
greeted
him
at
the
station
a
texas
man
turned
in
his
legally
owned
ak-
to
his
local
police
station
in
an
attempt
to
do
his
part
to
stop
mass
killings
according
to
ktbc-tv
the
man
identified
in
the
story
only
as
billy
from
austin
made
sure
to
alert
the
media
of
his
intentions
so
ktbc
could
send
a
reporter
and
a
camera
to
document
him
bringing
his
weapon
to
an
officer
who
appeared
unsure
what
to
do
with
it
at
first
billy
called
for
other
legal
gun
owners
to
have
the
courage
to
follow
his
lead
i
would
encourage
anyone
that
is
in
my
position
to
do
the
same
billy
told
ktbc
it's
not
easy
it
takes
a
lot
more
thought
and
a
lot
more
courage
to
do
this
than
to
buy
it
so
with
the
local
news
on
board
to
film
every
step
billy
courageously
loaded
his
ak-
into
his
truck
and
drove
to
the
police
station
he
left
the
gun
in
the
truck
and
walked
inside
to
announce
his
intentions
to
the
officer
on
duty
at
the
front
counter
as
the
officer
was
on
the
phone
checking
on
what
do
do
in
this
scenario
billy
took
a
moment
to
lecture
him
about
the
need
to
have
these
weapons
off
the
street
if
anyone
else
is
wondering
what
to
do
with
their
assault
rifles
this
is
one
option
surrender
it
billy
tells
the
officer
y'all
had
a
program
once
either
that
or
sell
it
back
to
a
gun
shop
the
officer
replied
no
i
don't
want
it
out
on
the
street
you
don't
want
it
out
on
the
street
either
billy
said
y'all's
job
is
hard
enough
another
officer
escorted
billy
out
to
the
truck
to
retrieve
the
gun
when
the
transaction
is
complete
billy
tells
the
officer
i
hope
you
appreciate
one
more
off
the
street
another
comment
that
suggests
billy
feels
he
is
doing
the
police
a
favor
we
need
to
get
them
off
the
streets
billy
told
ktbc
i
need
to
get
mine
off
the
streets
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
and
pray
for
everyone
else
billy's
obsession
with
getting
his
ak-
off
the
streets
is
odd
considering
it
wasn't
really
on
the
street
it
was
presumably
in
secure
possession
of
a
responsible
nonviolent
owner
billy
told
ktbc
he
had
owned
a
gun
since
he
was
years
old
unless
billy
had
intentions
of
committing
mass
murder
himself
he
did
not
prevent
any
tragedies
by
giving
away
his
own
gun
but
that
reality
doesn't
stop
billy
from
being
quite
pleased
with
himself
i'm
trying
to
make
a
safer
place
for
you
and
me
and
my
grandbabies
