bernie
sanders
open
to
meat
tax
to
fight
climate
change
in
answer
to
insane
town
hall
question
this
woman's
question
was
all
the
red
flags
but
sanders
said
it
was
great
and
went
along
with
the
nutbar
premise
socialist
candidate
for
the
democratic
nomination
bernie
sanders
or
should
we
say
one
of
the
socialist
candidates
is
very
big
on
the
little
guy
or
so
he
claims
but
he
like
all
who
support
drastic
action
for
climate
change
turns
that
supposed
concern
upside
when
it
comes
to
government
action
designed
to
control
and
re-engineer
the
behavior
of
individual
human
beings
in
this
particular
case
we're
talking
about
sanders
recent
green
thumb
up
to
the
idea
of
a
meat
tax
sanders
was
answering
questions
from
the
crowd
when
he
said
he
was
open
to
a
meat
tax
an
audience
member
began
her
question
by
declaring
that
animal
agriculture
is
to
blame
for
the
majority
of
climate
change
and
is
the
leading
cause
of
deforestation
water
and
air
pollution
and
biodiversity
loss
the
obvious
activist
had
two
parts
to
her
question
first
she
said
with
that
being
known
what
do
you
plan
on
doing
to
ensure
that
americans
limit
their
consumption
of
animal
products
a
sort
of
giving
away
of
the
game
regarding
the
social
engineering
here
ensure
she
said
animal
products
she
said
that
was
about
half
of
the
extremist
eco-nut
red
flags
in
a
matter
of
a
few
words
the
second
part
of
her
question
is
what
roped
him
in
germany
has
imposed
a
meat
tax
in
hopes
of
limiting
this
consumption
what
are
your
plans
to
stop
these
large
corporations
from
further
usurping
natural
resources
and
polluting
the
planet
in
response
to
that
obviously
insane
question
bernie
replied
it's
a
good
question
then
he
opened
the
door
to
not
just
the
meat
tax
but
who
knows
what
other
crazy
scheme
the
woman
and
other
members
of
her
cell
can
cook
up
to
forbid
you
having
steak
watch
thank
you
for
the
question
and
it's
a
good
question
all
i
can
say
is
if
we
believe
as
i
do
and
you
do
that
climate
change
is
real
we're
gonna
have
to
tackle
it
in
every
single
area
including
agriculture
okay
a
long
long
time
ago
way
back
in
there
was
an
op-ed
in
philadelphia
magazine
ahead
of
the
pennsylvania
primaries
regarding
the
idea
of
a
soda
tax
the
editorial
said
that
the
proposed
city
tax
on
soda
would
be
regressive
disproportionately
affecting
lower
and
middle
class
families
and
thus
the
author
of
the
op-ed
opposed
it
even
though
democratic
luminaries
like
hillary
clinton
came
out
in
favor
of
it
that
op-ed
was
written
by
bernie
sanders
his
argument
that
taxing
sugar
drinks
like
juice
boxes
and
sodas
would
cause
a
greater
burden
on
those
families
than
on
wealthy
families
who
could
easily
afford
the
price
different
is
of
course
exactly
as
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
meat
tax
any
tax
designed
to
force
you
to
change
your
behavior
by
its
nature
depends
on
your
action
being
dictated
by
price
concerns
it's
obvious
yet
when
answering
this
obvious
extremist
on
her
crazy
proposals
to
avert
the
impending
armageddon
her
particular
religion
so
fervently
believes
in
and
fears
sanders
said
it
was
a
good
question
and
that
he
would
certainly
look
at
agriculture
and
take
action
you're
right
he
said
in
answer
to
her
question
about
imposing
a
meat
tax
and
other
oppressive
restrictions
to
force
people
to
change
their
habits
what
a
difference
two
and
a
half
years
makes
