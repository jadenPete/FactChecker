attorneys
against
blocking
folks
on

she
says
she
has
every
right
the

is
being
taken
to
task
by
the

group
that
sued

and
won
congresswoman
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
has
been
warned
by
a
group
of
attorneys
from
columbia
university
that
she
cannot
block
people
from
twitter
because
of
her
capacity
as
a
public
official
the
democratic
socialist
firebrand
is
arguing
that
she
has
every
right
to
cut
off
followers
who
she
perceives
as
harassing
her
but
the
representative
from
new
york
is
tussling
with
the
same
group
that
successfully
sued
president
donald
trump
over
the
same
issue
what
are
the
details
columbia
university's
knight
first
amendment
institute
sued
president
trump
and
a
few
other
administration
officials
earlier
this
year
arguing
that
the
president
could
not
limit
users
from
seeing
his
social
media
account
because
doing
so
was
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
just
last
month
the
second
u.s.
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
despite
the
president's
argument
that
his
realdonaldtrump
handle
was
his
personal
account
and
that
he
has
the
freedom
to
block
whomever
he
wants
on
wednesday
the
knight
first
amendment
institute
sent
a
letter
to
rep
ocasio-cortez
warning
the
congresswoman
that
her
practice
of
blocking
twitter
users
is
unconstitutional
and
urging
her
to
unblock
any
twitter
users
whom
you
or
your
staff
have
blocked
from
the
aoc
account
because
of
the
viewpoints
they
have
expressed
unsurprisingly
ocasio-cortez
responded
via
twitter
telling
the
organization
i
have
million
followers
less
than
accounts
are
blocked
for
ongoing
harassment
are
my
constituents
she
added
harassment
is
not
a
viewpoint
some
accounts
like
the
daily
caller
posted
fake
nude
photos
of
me
abused
my
comments
to
spread
it
no
one
is
entitled
to
abuse

allahpundit
reported
on
the
situation
friday
and
pointed
out
bottom
line
she's
going
to
lose
in
court
if
this
ends
up
there
and
anyone
who's
read
the
second
circuit
opinion
would
know
that
allahpundit
further
noted
that
all
ocasio-cortez
has
to
do
to
tune
out
trolls
is
to
use
twitter's
mute
function
adding
she's
supposed
to
be
the
most
savvy-social-media
user
in
all
of
government
how
is
it
that
she
doesn't
understand
that
this
simple
solution
is
available
to
her
