she
was
rooting
for
a
direct
hit
by
hurricane
dorian
on
president
donald
trump's
residence
at
mar-a-lago
dorian
could
be
as
large
as
a
category
hurricane
by
the
time
it
makes
landfall
in
florida
the
president
is
not
expected
to
be
in
florida
when
the
storm
hits

revkin
about
how
bad
the
storm
was
getting
campbell
quipped
i'm
rooting
for
a
direct
hit
on
mar-a-lago
when
another
twitter
user
asked
campbell
what
the
heck
is
wrong
with
you
and
noted
that
there
are
real
people
who
live
and
work
there
she
responded
as
there
are
in
puerto
rico
sorry
you
don't
get
snark
but
trump's
indifference
to
suffering
is
intolerable
w
oul
d
also
help
if
he
tackled
climate
change
which
is
making
hurricanes
more
destructive
instead
he
will
remove
limits
on
methane
get
a
grip
she
also
claimed
that
if
mar-a-lago
were
hit
by
hurricane
dorian

be
quick
with
fema
funds

still
have
no
empathy
for
puerto
rico
on
thursday
night
campbell
tweeted
a
story
from
the
hill
that
noted
that
mar-a-lago
could
very
well
be
hit
by
the
storm
and
said
and
no
i
don't
wish
anyone
anywhere
the
horror
of
being
hit
by
a
category
hurricane
but
not
everyone
can
have
the
protection
of
a
fortress
like
mar
a
lago
built
to
be
hurricane-proof
trump
will
not
bear
the
cost
of
his
immoral
abdication
of
the
climate
challenge
later
that
same
night
campbell
quote
tweeted
another
tweet
about
the
intensity
of
the

will
see
if
mrs

design
can
stand
up
to
the
assault
i
know
palm
beach
well
and
am
sorry
if
it
gets
a
big
hit
i
wish

up
