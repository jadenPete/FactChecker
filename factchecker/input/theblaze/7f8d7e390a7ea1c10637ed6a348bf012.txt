that
president
donald
trump
responded
harshly
monday
to
a
report
claiming
that
he
has
suggested
using
nuclear
bombs
to
thwart
hurricanes
from
making
landfall
in
the
united
states
axios
reported
sunday
citing
anonymous
sources
that
trump
has
proposed
multiple
times
to
senior
national
security
officials
that
they
explore
the
possibility
of
using
nuclear
weapons
to
prevent
hurricanes
from
making
landfall
over
u.s.
soil
they
start
forming
off
the
coast
of
africa
as
they're
moving
across
the
atlantic
we
drop
a
bomb
inside
the
eye
of
the
hurricane
and
it
disrupts
it
why
can't
we
do
that
one
source
paraphrasing
the
president
claimed
trump
said
during
a
hurricane
briefing
at
the
white
house
in
a
second
instance
which
was
allegedly
recorded
in
a
national
security
council
memorandum
trump
floated
the
idea
of
bombing
hurricanes
axios
reported
although
not
specifically
mentioning
nuclear
bombs
the
idea
of
using
nuclear
weapons
is
not
an
idea
attributed
to
trump
in
fact
according
to
axios
the
idea
originates
from
a
mid-
th
century
government
scientist
however
it
is
so
popular
that
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
association
has
explained
why
the
idea
is
not
good
the
agency
explains
how
did
trump
respond
trump
fired
off
a
tweet
monday
calling
the
report
fake
news
still
white
house
officials
who
spoke
with
axios
said
that
trump
did
in
fact
make
the
suggestion
but
it
should
not
be
cause
for
concern
his
objective
is
not
bad
one
official
said
his
goal
to
keep
a
catastrophic
hurricane
from
hitting
the
mainland
is
not
bad
for
me
alarm
bells
weren't
going
off
when
i
heard
about
it
but
i
did
think
somebody
is
going
to
use
this
to

into
the
president

crazy
narrative
