stuns
festival-goers
prompts
anti-defamation
league
to
speak
out
what
an
ugly
visual
this
year's
burning
man
festival
included
a
display
of
a
barbie
death
camp
and
wine
bistro
art
exhibit
many
people
are
now
criticizing
its
creator
year-old
jewish
artist
james
jacoby
for
trivializing
the
holocaust
what
are
the
details
of
the
exhibit
barbie
dolls
were
used
in
the
exhibit
which
featured
many
of
them
marching
into
an
oven
nailed
to
crosses
and
dismembered
according
to
the
jewish
news
of
northern
california
the
exhibit
also
featured
a
sign
boasting
that
it
was
the
friendliest
concentration
camp
at
burning
man
and
also
a
banner
that
read
arbeit
macht
plastik
frei
work
makes
plastic
free
a
nod
to
the
message
inscribed
on
the
gates
of
auschwitz
which
when
translated
read
work
makes
you
free
the
anti-defamation
league
revealed
that
it
had
received
a
variety
of
complaints
about
the
art
installation
seth
brysk
director
of
the
foundation's
san
francisco
regional
office
said
that
while
people
have
the
right
to
express
themselves
using
that
free
expression
to
trivialize
the
holocaust
for
the
sake
of
political
social
or
artistic
ends
is
deeply
offensive
and
inappropriate
we
would
ask
people
not
to
do
so
brysk
added
it
tarnishes
the
memories
of
those
who
died
including
the
million
jews
and
million
others
he
continued
particularly
in
the
current
environment
where
we
have
a
confluence
of
survivors
no
longer
around
to
tell
their
stories
and
increased
extremism
and
hatred
we
think
it's
more
important
than
ever
to
preserve
and
respect
the
memory
of
the
holocaust
has
the
artist
spoken
out
jacoby
told
the
outlet
that
the
project
was
a
year
labor
of
love
and
insisted
that
he
didn't
aim
to
trigger
anyone
with
the
exhibit
arguing
that
the
annual
festival
is
not
a
safe
space
jacoby
refused
to
take
the
installation
down
it's
not
yale
university
you
don't
get
to
run
and
hide
from
something
you
don't
like
jacoby
told
the
outlet
there's
theme
camps
if
you
don't
like
ours
go
to
another
one
jacoby
also
said
that
the
installation
which
he
has
operated
at
the
annual
festival
over
a
period
of
years
has
been
successful
it's
a
chance
to
meet
people
and
have
a
friendly
conversation
he
said
of
the
display
a
couple
of
guys
have
gotten
laid
because
women
come
and
stop
it's
a
rather
sexually
charged
atmosphere
he
added
you
get
a
chance
to
engage
people
he
later
added
that
much
of
the
yearly
event's
appeal
is
that
it
is
offensive
part
of
the
magic
of
burning
man
is
that
it's
not
vanilla
disneyland
pro-family
jacoby
said
there's
a
lot
of
nudity
a
lot
of
sex
a
lot
of
drugs
it's
not
a
family-friendly
environment
and
our
camp
isn't
either
