if
cheating
on
your
husband
really
made
you
a
better
mom
then
why
not
tell
him
about
it
on
saturday's
podcast
psuedo
intellectual
host
lauren
and
her
fiance
liam
discussed
a
recent
book
that
claimed
women
have
been
cheating
on
their
spouses
out
of
necessity
in
this
clip
lauren
explained
her
frustration
with
people
who
cheated
on
their
spouse
and
justified
their
actions
by
saying
they
were
better
parents
and
spouses
when
they
cheat
because
they
feel
happy
lauren
went
on
to
express
her
strong
opinion
about
the
negative
impact
that
feminism
had
on
relationships
and
the
toxic
behavior
that
followed
if
cheating
on
husband
really
made
you
a
better
mom
then
why
not
tell
him
about
it
lauren
asked
rhetorically
your
flaws
are
not
something
to
be
celebrated
