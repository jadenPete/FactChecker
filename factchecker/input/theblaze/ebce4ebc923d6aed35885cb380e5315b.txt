years

the

nation
plans

from
a
year-old

d.c.
the
native
american
tribe
announced
on

what's
the
background
in
the
cherokee
nation
was
forced
to
sign
the
treaty
of
new
echota
with
the
united
states
in
this
lopsided
agreement
the
cherokee
people
were
forced
to
move
from
their
homes
in
north
carolina
along
the
trail
of
tears
to
what
is
now
oklahoma
nearly
cherokees

go
quietly
the
u.s.
government
offered
them
the
right
to
send
a
delegate
to
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
this
would
change
the
dynamic
between
the
strong
cherokee
nation
and
the
united
states
by
more
closely
integrating
the
two
what
happened
now
the
cherokee
nation's
vice
president
of
government
relations
kimberly
teehee
has
been
nominated
as
the
first
person
to
serve
in
this
role
but
has
yet
to
be
formally
approved
by
the
tribal
council
this
vote
is
scheduled
to
take
place
on
thursday
after
this
the
cherokee
nation
and
the
u.s.
government
would
have
to
agree
on
what
this
delegate's
role
might
look
like
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
roadmaps
that
are
laid
out
as
a
suggested
path
to
seating
our
delegate
and
certainly
the
delegates
afforded
the
territories
give
us
an
idea
of
what
is
workable
in
the
congress
the
tribe's
principal
chief
chuck
hoskin
jr
told
cnn
what
else
the
current
u.s.
territories
puerto
rico
the
u.s.
virgin
islands
guam
the
northern
mariana
islands
and
american
samoa
as
well
as
the
district
of
columbia
all
send
non-voting
members
to
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
although
these
delegates
are
not
able
to
participate
in
floor
votes
they
can
sit
on
committees
vote
on
these
committees
introduce
bills
and
speak
on
the
floor
of
the
house
hoskin
said
that
the
cherokee
nation
is
today
in
a
position
of
strength
that
i
think
is
unprecedented
in
its
history
