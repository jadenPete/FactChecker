options

what
happened
curtis
whitson
his
girlfriend
krystal
ramirez
and
his
teenage
son
hunter
were
hiking
on
father's
day
weekend
when
they
found
themselves
trapped
at
the
top
of
a
waterfall
in
the
arroyo
seco
canyon
in
california's
pfeiffer
big
sur
state
park
a
rope
that
whitson
had
used
in
the
past
to
rappel
down
the
steep
cliffs
that
stood
between
them
and
their
camp
was
gone
my
heart
sank
when
i
realized
the
volume
of
water
was
just
too
dangerous
to
make
rappelling
down
possible
whitson
said
cnn
reported
after
trying
unsuccessfully
to
find
their
way
out
of
the
park
whitson
wrote
an
sos
note
put
it
in
one
of
their
empty
water
bottles
and
threw
it
in
the
river
we
are
stuck
here
at
the
waterfall
whitson
wrote
get
help
please
he
also
scratched
help
onto
the
side
of
the
bottle
in
the
hopes
that
it
would
catch
someone's
eye
ramirez
told
the
washington
post
that
she
had
brought
pens
and
bar
order
pad
for
a
way
to
keep
score
playing
card
games
because
she
was
very
competitive
little
did
she
know
that
this
pad
would
end
up
helping
to
save
them
they
also
spelled
out
sos
with
rocks
other
hikers
found
the
bottle
soon
afterward
they
alerted
authorities
and
the
california
highway
patrol
air
operations
unit
began
looking
for
the
three
missing
adventurers
they
were
found
within
hours
and
rescued
the
following
day
what
else
tony
ramage
of
the
chp
a
new
father
himself
told
cbs
news
i
t
would've
been
pretty
almost
impossible
in
some
areas
to
actually
get
out
of
there
you
know
ramage's
chp
colleague
todd
brethour
added
t
hey
were
really
out
of
options
if
they
hadn't
gotten
the
message
out
that
way
it
might've
been
a
while
