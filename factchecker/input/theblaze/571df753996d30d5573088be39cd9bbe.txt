reinstates

a
federal
judge
in
california
has
disregarded
a
higher
court's
ruling
to
reinstate
a
nationwide
injunction
against
one
of
the
trump
administration's
new
immigration
rules
on
monday
u.s.
district
judge
jon
tigar
issued
a
court
order
for
a
nationwide
halt
to
enforcement
of
a
trump
administration
rule
requiring
asylum-seekers
who
come
through
multiple
countries
to
apply
for
refuge
in
a
safe
third
country
along
the
way
tigar
had
already
blocked
the
rule
once
before
in
mid-august
but
after
the
case
was
appealed
the
injunction
was
dialed
back
by
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
limited
to
the
injunction
to
areas
within
their
geographic
territory
in
effect
this
meant
that
the
new
policy
would
only
have
gone
into
effect
for
the
time
being
in
texas
and
new
mexico
but
not
in
arizona
and
california
which
are
within
the
th
circuit's
territory
while
nationwide
injunctions
are
not
the
general
rule
tigar
an
obama
appointee
who
is
a
judge
for
the
northern
district
of
california
concluded
in
his
latest
decision
they
are
appropriate
where
such
breadth
is
necessary
to
remedy
a
plaintiff's
harm
the
trump
administration
responded
to
the
th
circuit's
august
decision
by
asking
the
supreme
court
to
allow
for
the
enforcement
of
the
asylum
rule
despite
the
ongoing
legal
fight
this
fight
over
this
injunction
highlights
the
ongoing
debate
about
whether
or
not
lower-level
federal
judges
should
be
able
to
unilaterally
stop
the
enforcement
of
laws
and
regulations
outside
of
their
own
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
while
nationwide
injunctions
have
become
a
fairly
common
legal
tool
used
by
organizations
and
activists
to
obstruct
president
trump's
agenda
so
long
as
they're
willing
to
shop
around
for
a
sympathetic
federal
judge
opponents
say
that
they
upend
the
checks
and
balances
of
the
federal
system
laid
out
in
the
constitution
while
a
small
number
of
suits
present
matters
and
settings
for
which
nationwide
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
federal
district
court
judges
have
issued
nationwide
injunctions
in
situations
far
beyond
that
set
writes
ronald

boston
university
school
of
law
in
a
academic
paper
expanded
use
of
nationwide
injunctions
especially
broad
injunctions
against
the
united
states
undermines
rule-of-law
values
threatens
the
operation
of
courts
as
impartial
arbiters
of
disputes
over
legal
rights
erodes
the
constitution's
careful
separation
of
functions
among
the
branches
of
government
and
is
at
odds
with
basic
aspects
of
the
federal
judiciary's
design
including
its
geographic
divisions
recently
attorney
general
william
barr
lamented
in
a
wall
street
journal

that
virtually
every
significant
congressional
