in
a
statement
ogilvy
said
india
is
a
diverse
country
with
people
of
different
castes
creed
languages
regions
religions
everyone
living
together
but
not
always
with
love
dairy
milk
which
is
loved
by
everyone
wanted
to
send
a
powerful
message
of
unity
so
we
worked
with
the
brand
to
create
the
unity
bar
india's
first
chocolate
made
of
dark
blended
milk
and
white
chocolate
all
united
in
one
bar
what
are
people
saying
about
this
thing
a
myriad
of
social
media
users
joked
that
racism
had
been
solved
because
of
cadbury's
new
chocolate
bar
other
social
media
users
were
less
lighthearted
when
talking
about
the
bar
saying
that
it
was
an
insult
here
are
some
of
the
more
interesting
responses
to
cadbury's
latest
debut
wipes
hands
off
and
that's
the
end
of
racism
why
are
they
all
segregated
by
color
thenthis
is
everything
wrong
with
diversity
you
force
in
a
set
amount
of
predefined
difference
and
it's
going
to
taste
awful
i
would
rather
see
a
range
where
you
don't
know
what
you're
going
to
get
but
it's
going
to
taste
amazing
whatever
it
is
this
is
as
absurd
as
kendall
jenner
fighting
police
brutality
with
a
pepsiyou
would
think
if
they
were
going
for
unity
that
all
of
the
types
would
be
interspersed
instead
of
segregated
from
light
to
dark
no
less
this
is
the
problem
with
playing
to
the
woke
crowd
you
better
get
it
right
congratulations
to
cadbury
for
solving
racism
ever
since
cadbury
chocolates
was
purchased
by
kraft
they
set
out
to
repackage
the
chocolates
to
promote
eugenics
separate
but
equal
that
is
what
i
see
on
this
unity
bar
wrapper
and
not
