federal
deficit
passes
trillion
in
first
months
of
this
fiscal
year
the
white
house
predicted
that
it
would
remain
over
trillion
for
a
few
years
the
federal
budget
deficit
the
amount
that
the
government
spends
beyond
what
it
takes
in
each
year
has
passed
trillion
in
the
first
months
of
the
fiscal
year
this
is
the
highest
that
it's
been
since
the
end
of
the
recession
what
happened
now
the
congressional
budget
office
reported
monday
that
the
deficit
hit
trillion
this
was
billion
more
than
the
deficit
recorded
during
the
same
period
last
year
revenue
actually
increased
during
this
time
from
by
billion
over
the
previous
year
due
largely
to
increased
wages
and
economic
growth
but
spending
also
increased
by
more
than
double
this
amount
billion
while
the
cbo
still
expects
the
total
deficit
for
this
fiscal
year
to
drop
to
billion
due
to
tax
payments
coming
in
next
month
the
white
house
estimated
that
it
would
reach
trillion
and
remain
at
more
than
trillion
for
every
fiscal
year
until
what
else
the
only
other
time
in
u.s.
history
that
the
deficit
passed
trillion
was
between
and
when
the
federal
government
used
bailouts
and
other
measures
to
try
to
counter
the
effects
of
the
recession
by
the
deficit
had
shrunk
to
billion
and
it
continued
to
decrease
from
one
year
to
the
next
throughout
before
rising
slightly
to
billion
in
the
deficit
has
grown
during
every
year
of
the
trump
presidency
the
federal
government
has
not
had
a
budget
surplus
since
debt
is
on
an
unsustainable
course
in
cbo's
projections
the
cbo
wrote
on
feb
to
put
it
on
a
sustainable
one
lawmakers
will
have
to
make
significant
changes
to
tax
and
spending
policies
making
revenues
larger
than
they
would
be
under
current
law
making
spending
for
large
benefit
programs
smaller
than
it
would
be
under
current
law
or
adopting
some
combination
of
those
approaches
both
president
donald
trump
and
congress
have
approved
significant
increases
in
government
spending
compared
to
the
obama
presidency
the
deficit
for
each
fiscal
year
combined
with
interest

to
the
national
debt
this
year
the
national
debt

reached
percent
of
the
gross
domestic
product
the
largest
percentage
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
during
the
election
the
debt
was
at
trillion
before
he
was
elected
president
donald
trump
had
talked
about
reducing
the
national
debt
