as
a
m
prior

their
chicken
in

staged
a
die
in
outside
the
restaurant
chick-fil-a
patrons

has
given
millions
of
dollars
to
anti-lgbtq
s
organizations
including
known
hate
groups
and
proponents
of
conversion
therapy
and
continues
to
do
so
every
year
the
said
according
to
ctv
news
many
u.s.
cities
campuses
and
retail
outlets
have
refused
to
allow
chick-fil-a
to
locate
within
their
spaces
and
or
have
been
vocal
opponents
of
the
corporation's
hateful
values
toronto
and
the
rest
of
canada
need
to
be
next
in
line
this
is
school
yard
bullying
tactics
but
canadian
evangelical
christian
leader
charles
mcvety
who's
planned
an
event
for
saturday
outside
the
restaurant
told
the

that
christians
will
not
be
driven
out
of
the
city
mcvety
added
to
ctv
news
that
those
marching
in
the
th
annual
jesus
in
the
city
parade
saturday
should
stop
by
the
chick-fil-a
to
pray
for
freedom
and
security
in
an
interview
with
the
station
he
added
that
it's
upsetting
that
people
want
to
stop
a
business
simply
because
it
adheres
to
christian
values
this
business
is
only
about
chicken
it
should
only
be
about
chicken
it
should
not
happen
in
canada
if
you
just
want
to
get
chicken
you
shouldn't
be
shamed
we
have
sympathy
for
the
gay
community
we
love
the
gay
community
but
we
would
never
commend
anyone
for
shouting
people
down
this
is
school
yard
bullying
tactics
and
we
are
against
bullying
give
us
a
try

we
respect
people's
right
to
share
their
opinions
