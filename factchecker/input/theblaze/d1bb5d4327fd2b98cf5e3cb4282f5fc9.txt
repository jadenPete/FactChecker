iowa
teacher
says
joe
biden
got
too
grabby
with
her
and
there's
video
of
the
uncomfortable
interaction
in
my
mind
i'm
like
this
is
part
of
our
problem
an
iowa
teacher
complained
that
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
grabbed
her
hands
without
asking
after
she
asked
him
a
question
and
it
was
all
caught
on
video
the
former
vice
president
was
talking
to
voters
at
the
hawkeye
area
labor
council's
labor
day
picnic
in
cedar
rapids
iowa
when
it
happened
i
think
that
he
means
well
but
you
know
he
grabbed
my
hands
right
away
and
that
was
really
uncomfortable
jessica
roman
told
the
washington
examiner
biden
has
been
publicly
chastised
for
his
frequent
forays
into
women's
personal
spaces
without
warning
or
invitation
he
had
promised
to
be
more
careful
and
respect
women
he
was
very
close
and
in
my
mind
i'm
like
this
is
part
of
our
problem
not
recognizing
that
you
need
to
ask
first
or
can
i
shake
your
hand
roman
continued
not
just
grab
your
hands
and
hang
onto
them
she
added
that
bothers
me
the
uncomfortable
interaction
was
caught
on
video
roman
also
said
that
she
was
not
satisfied
with
the
answer
biden
gave
to
her
question
which
she
said
lacked
detail
she
was
very
critical
of
his
entire
candidacy
it's
been
too
long
since
he's
raised
a
family
too
long
since
he's
lived
on
a
normal
paycheck
she
explained
i
want
somebody
that
actually
gets
it
that
understands
what
it
is
to
live
on
the
paychecks
that
we
live
on
the
housing
crisis
that
we
have
all
of
the
ways
that
those
things
affect
us
