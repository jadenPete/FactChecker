carly
fiorina
slams
gop
loyalty
to
president
trump
drawing
speculation
she
might
challenge
him
in
this
country
we
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
not
the
president
is
carly
fiorina
mulling
over
a
challenge
to
president
donald
trump
that's
the
question
many
were
left
asking
monday
after
fiorina
targeted
the
president
and
the
republican
party
with
blistering
critique
fiorina
the
former
hewlett-packard
ceo
who
ran
for
the
republican
nomination
in
illuminated
what
many
so-called
nevertrump
republicans
criticize
in
the
age
of
trump
the
newfound
emphasis
on
loyalty
to
trump
when
did
so
many
republicans
decide
that
we
should
also
pledge
allegiance
to
the
party
and
swear
fidelity
to
president
trump
fiorina
wrote
i
have
been
called
disloyal
because
i
am
critical
of
trump
i
am
not
alone
she
added
many
others
have
been
intimidated
into
silence
or
compelled
to
defend
the
indefensible
silencing
those
disloyal
to
the
president
amounts
to
an
abdication
of
our
responsibility
to
help
create
a
more
perfect
union
fiorina
said
insisting
that
trump
must
earn
loyalty
from
americans
not
coerce
it
as
citizens
it
is
both
our
responsibility
and
our
right
to
hold
elected
officials
accountable
for
their
words
their
actions
and
the
consequences
of
both
fiorina
wrote
fiorina
has
been
mostly
silent
about
trump
since
he
took
office
in
she
endorsed
trump
ahead
of
the
general
election
after
first
joining
texas
sen
ted
cruz
as
his
running
mate
but
later
rescinded
the
endorsement
after
the
infamous
access
hollywood
tape
surfaced
at
the
time
fiorina
urged
trump
to
step
aside
to
allow
mike
pence
to
run
as
the
republican
nominee
so
the
question
remains
will
fiorina
become
the
fourth
republican
to
challenge
trump
she's
not
running
a
source
close
to
fiorina
told
national
review
she
has
no
plans
to
run
in
the
republican
primary
against
trump
or
as
a
third-party
candidate
