has
skyrocketed
the
united
kingdom's
national

considering
a

services
according
to

a
clinic
in
the
u.k.
that
evaluates
patients
for
potential
gender
transition
treatments
has
seen
an
increase
in
patient
volume
of
more
than
percent
since
resulting
in
a
waiting
list
of
about
two
years
more
than
children
were
referred
to
the
clinic
just
last
year
including
some
and
year
olds
in
order
to
deal
with
the
volume
the
clinic
is
considering
a
plan
for
patients
to
be
able
to
consult
with
a
doctor
using
services
such
as
skype
or
apple's
facetime
function
allowing
doctors
to
diagnose
and
prescribe
gender
transition
issues
and
treatments
such
as
hormone
therapy
remotely
the
daily
mail
reported
that
the
clinic
has
already
faced
criticism
from
psychologists
who
say
it
uses
untested
drugs
on
troubled
children
and
rushes
them
toward
becoming
transgender
the
gender

service
run
by
an
nhs
trust
is
advocating
for
the
necessity
of
remote
consultations
for
gender
confusion
issues
the
trust
is
working
to
minimize
waiting
times
and
make
clinical
support
easier
to
access
including
eliminating
travel
time
for
young
people
and
their
families
which
will
also
allow
us
to
offer
appointments
earlier
and
later
in
the
day
a
spokesman
said
as
with
the
rest
of
the
nhs
innovations
like
telemedicine
are
an
addition
and
will
not
mean
the
removal
or
inability
to
access
face-to-face
consultations
the
trust
and
gids
welcome
all
open
and
informed
discussion
and
decision-making
around
the
best
way
to
support
young
people
experiencing
difficulties
or
distress
around
their
gender
identity
the
statement
continued
the
statement
did
not
address
concerns
about
the
ability
of
a
medical
professional
to
accurately
diagnose
gender
confusion
or
dysphoria
remotely
particularly
in
young
children
who
may
not
even
have
fully
formed
concepts
of
gender
