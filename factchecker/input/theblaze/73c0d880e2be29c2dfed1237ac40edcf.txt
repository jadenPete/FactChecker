down
nbc
anchor
who
asks
if
russia
was
responsible
for
president
trump
winning
let's
give
the
credit
to
the
americans
who
went
out
and
voted
for
somebody
who
they
thought
would
bring
change
russian
scholar
and
former
secretary
of
state
condoleezza
rice
dismissed
a
question
from
nbc's
savannah
guthrie
during
an
interview
wednesday
telling
the
anchor
it
was
insulting
to
american
voters
to
suggest
that
russia
helped
president
donald
trump
win
election
in
what
are
the
details
rice
sat
down
with
guthrie
on
the
today
show
to
discuss
her
new
book
on
the
cold
war
titled
to
build
a
better
world
the
former
bush
appointee
was
joined
by
her
co-author
former
commissioner
philip
zelikow
guthrie
asked
when
you
look
at
the
election
and
you
look
at
how
relatively
speaking
it
was
decided
by
a
handful
of
votes
in
a
few
states
do
you
think
it's
possible
that
russia's
election
interference
actually
worked
it
actually
elected
donald
trump
over
hillary
clinton
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
of
that
rice
responded
while
shaking
her
head
and
you
know
i
really
don't
think
that's
a
good
conversation
to
have
i
think
that
really
does
devalue
the
people
in
wisconsin
and
michigan
and
others
who
decided
to
vote
for
president
trump
rice
continued
whether
you
like
this
president
or
not
whether
you
believe
that
he
should
be
president
or
not
let's
give
the
credit
to
the
americans
who
went
out
and
voted
for
somebody
who
they
thought
would
bring
change
rice
added
the
question
is
are
we
going
to
be
responsive
to
some
of
the
messages
that
were
out
there
and
do
you
hear
me
now
do
people
who
felt
that
they
were
disadvantaged
by
globalization
the
unemployed
coal
miner
in
west
virginia
the
opioid-addicted
person
in
pennsylvania
are
we
going
to
be
responsive
to
those
people
that's
really
the
question
we
should
be
asking
watch
the
interview
in
its
entirety

exchange
on
russia
