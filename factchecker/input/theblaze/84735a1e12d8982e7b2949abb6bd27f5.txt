john
roberts
cast
the
deciding
vote
to
block
president
trump's
citizenship
census
question
after
changing
his
mind
shortly
before
the
decision
roberts
joined
with
the
four
liberal
justices
according
to
cnn
chief
justice
john
roberts
changed
his
mind
during
deliberations
before
voting
against
the
trump
administration
and
effectively
killing
plans
for
a
citizenship
question
on
the
census
what
happened
with
the
citizenship
question
in
march
the
u.s.
census
bureau
announced
that
it
planned
to
add
a
question
to
the
census
that
would
ask
respondents
for
their
citizenship
status
supporters
of
the
move
argued
that
the
inclusion
of
this
statistic
would
prevent
some
states
from
artificially
inflating
the
extent
of
their
population
which
determines
how
many
members
of
congress
and
electoral
votes
a
state
gets
while
opponents
said
that
it
would
prevent
both
noncitizen
and
citizen
immigrants
particularly
hispanics
from
responding
at
all
out
of
fear
the
last
time
that
a
u.s.
census
included
a
citizenship
question
was
on
june
the
supreme
court
effectively
blocked
this
question
from
being
added
to
the
census
by
sending
it
back
to
the
lower
courts
which
did
not
leave
enough
time
for
it
to
be
enacted
in
time
to
go
to
the
printers
roberts
joined
the
four
liberal
justices
stephen
breyer
ruth
bader
ginsburg
elena
kagan
and
sonia
sotomayor
in
arguing
that
while
the
inclusion
of
such
a
question
was
legal
the
trump
administration
needed
to
do
a
better
job
justifying
adding
it
to
the
census
trump
initially
said
that
he
would
use
an
executive
order
to
add
the
question
anyway
but
eventually
backed
away
from
this
he
also
bashed
the
decision
on
twitter
saying
that
the
u.s.
was
the
only
country
in
which
the
government
was
not
able
to
ask
whether
or
not
someone
is
a
citizen
what
did
roberts
do
according
to
cnn
sources
familiar
with
the
private
supreme
court
deliberations
stated
that
roberts
changed
his
vote
cnn
supreme
court
analyst
joan
biskupic
said
that
when
the
court
began
its
deliberations
in
april
roberts
was
prepared
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
administration
in
fact
during
oral
arguments
in
late
april
roberts
said
that
the
citizenship
question
was
not
any
less
valid
than
questions
that
had
appeared
on
the
census
questionnaire
in
the
past
involving
sex
age
things
like
that
or
even
do
you
own
a
radio
however
sometime
during
the
period
when
the
court
was
reviewing
the
case
roberts
began
to
question
what
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross's
motivations
were
for
pushing
for
this
change
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
roberts
used
the
word
contrived
to
describe
the
process
by
which
ross
justified
the
move
the
decision-making
process
for
the
court
is
not
typically
made
public
despite
this
reporting
cnn
admitted
to
not
knowing
the
full
context
of
these
deliberations
what
else
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
roberts
has
sided
with
his
more
liberal
colleagues
in
he
was
part
of
the
majority
in
a
ruling
that
saved
obamacare
in
that
case
roberts
was
expected
to
vote
with
the
conservatives
on
the
court
to
strike
down
obamacare's
individual
mandate
and
initially
indicated
that
he
would
do
so
before
switching
to
uphold
it
at
the
least
minute
in
fact
justice
ginsburg
was
reportedly
getting
ready
to
write
a
liberal
dissent
to
the
decision
before
roberts
made
his
change
of
heart
known
