the

off
the
dreadlocks
of
a
young
black
man
a
white
lady
who
loves
police
loves
trump
thinks
all

that
cutting
off

a
better
life

many
are
accusing
the
crushers
club
of
racism
because
of
a
tweet
that
innocuously
showed
support
for
the
chicago
police
another
that
called
for
president
donald
trump
to
help
chicago
and
another
that
proclaimed
that
all
lives
matter
the
organization
runs
a
boxing
gym
dedicated
to
helping
kids
escape
gangs
and
crime
and
has
been
praised
for
their
efforts
the
crushers
club
released
a
statement
denying
the
allegations
the
crusher's
club
does
not
have
any
policies
prohibiting
dreadlocks
read
the
statement
we
welcome
all
hairstyles
from
our
youth
on
two
occasions
our
kids
looked
to
change
their
hairstyles
and
asked
us
to
assist
i
understand
how
my
social
media
posts
could
be
interpreted
as
insensitive
but
that
was
never
my
intention
i
love
these
kids
like
my
own
and
i've
spent
nearly
two
decades
of
my
life
working
to
help
them
build
a
future
without
putting
their
lives
or
freedom
at
risk
the
statement
continued
my
goal
is
and
will
always
be
to
equip
our
youth
with
the
resources
to
improve
their
neighborhoods
maximize
their
potential
and
develop
into
the
leaders
of
tomorrow
in
response
to
the
furor
the
crushers
club
tweeted
a
video
of
kobe
the
young
black
man
who
asked
for
his
dreadlocks
to
be
cut
kobe
says
that
he
did
it
to
help
him
quit
gangs
and
seek
a
better
life
