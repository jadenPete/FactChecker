to
and
on
ammunition
ban
the
production
sale
and
importation
of

and
launch
an
investigation
into

association
among
several
more
sweeping
gun-control
laws
and
warren
is
not
alone
on
tuesday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
broke
down
the
details
of
warren's
sweeping
gun
control
proposal
and
showed
how
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
are
backing
new
gun-control
policies
that
would
circumvent
the
second
amendment
elizabeth
warren
is
now
proposing
additional
unconstitutional
actions
against
the
second
amendment
and
her
idea
is
to
tax
americans
out
of
their
guns
here's
what's
going
to
happen
glenn
said
the
federal
government
is
going
to
squeeze
the
banking
and
financial
community
to
stop
people
like
mastercard
and
visa
and
big
banks
from
doing
business
with
gun
manufacturers
giving
them
loans
even
offering
them
financial
services
to
not
only
the
gun
makers
but
also
the
gun
sellers
so
if
you
go
in
to
buy
a
gun
eventually
they'll
say
i'm
sorry
i
can't
take
visa
or
mastercard
or
american
express
they
don't
do
business
with
gun
sellers
so
then
what
do
you
do
write
a
check
he
continued
will
the
bank
cash
that
check
is
the
bank
willing
to
give
a
loan
to
either
the
guy
who
wants
to
open
up
his
gun
store
or
the
people
making
the
guns
and
then
after
all
that
is
done
imagine
the
price
of
guns
then
she
wants
to
tax
you
an
additional
percent
