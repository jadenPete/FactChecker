unfazed
bar
patron
casually
lights
cigarette
at
gunpoint
during
armed
robbery
he
refused
to
be
a
victim
after
a
long
hard
day
sometimes
you
just
don't
have
the
energy
to
put
up
with
any
riffraff
such
was
the
case
for
a
st
louis
bar
patron
earlier
this
week
who
defiantly
sat
through
an
armed
robbery
even
casually
firing
up
a
smoke
while
being
held
at
gunpoint
what
are
the
details
ksdk-tv
reported
that
a
suspect
armed
with
a
heavily
modified
pistol
ordered
customers
to
the
ground
at
berhmann's
tavern
shortly
after
midnight
on
wednesday
getting
away
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
but
surveillance
footage
of
the
incident
shared
by
the
daily
caller
shows
one
man
was
utterly
indifferent
to
the
chaos
the
video
shows
patrons
turning
around
to
look
at
some
sort
of
hubbub
before
holding
their
hands
up
and
dropping
to
the
ground
with
the
exception
of
our
hero
that
unnamed
guest
refused
to
be
bothered
by
the
commotion
and
continued
scrolling
through
his
phone
before
the
suspect
tried
to
steal
it
the
would-be
victim
wasn't
having
it
after
a
brief
struggle
the
criminal
continued
on
to
easier
targets
but
repeatedly
pointed
his
firearm
at
the
man
who
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
and
refused
to
leave
his
seat
at
the
bar
in
the
end
the
thief
got
away
with
some
goods
including
wallets
and
cell
phones
but
not
from
the
guy
who
refused
to
be
bothered
by
it
all
according
to
ksdk
the
suspect
is
still
at
large
and
is
described
as
being
in
his
late
s
to
mid-
s
he
was
reportedly
wearing
a
blue
shirt
and
dark
pants
during
the
crime
