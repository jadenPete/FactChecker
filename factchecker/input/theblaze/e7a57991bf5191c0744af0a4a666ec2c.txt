tulsi
gabbard
breaks
ranks
from
democratic
candidates
says
she
actually
supports
some
restrictions
on
abortion
she
also
spoke
out
in
favor
of
border
security
and
against
open
borders
democratic
presidential
hopeful
rep
tulsi
gabbard
hawaii
broke
with
other
members
of
her
party
when
she
revealed
that
she
believed
that
abortion
should
be
limited
with
exceptions
to
before
the
start
of
a
pregnancy's
third
trimester
she
also
criticized
her
fellow
democrats
for
supporting
open
borders
policies
what
did
she
say
during
an
interview
monday
libertarian
host
dave
rubin
asked
gabbard
to
clarify
her
position
on
abortion
rubin
noted
that
gabbard
used
to
be
pro-life
and
admitted
that
he
was
becoming
more
pro-life
due
to
the
recently
radical
abortion
policies
espoused
by
members
of
the
democratic
party
gabbard
said
that
her
own
position
had
changed
along
with
her
understanding
of
the
role
of
government
she
said
she
took
a
more
libertarian
position
on
this
issue
that
government
really
shouldn't
be
in
that
place
of
dictating
to
a
woman
the
choice
that
she
should
make
i
think
that
there
should
be
some
restrictions
though
she
continued
you
know
for
me
personally
i
would
not
make
that
choice
for
myself
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
should
be
telling
anyone
else
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
they
should
make
for
themselves
or
for
their
family
and
therefore
a
woman
should
have
a
right
to
choose
and
i
will
stand
up
and
protect
her
right
to
do
so
she
also
said
that
she
believed
that
abortion
should
be
restricted
at
the
third
trimester
unless
a
woman's
life
or
severe
consequences
is
at
risk
then
there
shouldn't
be
an
abortion
in
the
third
trimester
this
view
is
in
contrast
to
her
fellow
democratic
candidates
including
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
who
argued
friday
that
a
baby
was
not
alive
until
it
had
taken
its
first
breath
historically
gabbard
has
made
conflicting
statements
about
her
position
on
abortion
according
to
national
review
she
initially
claimed
to
be
pro-life
but
currently
has
a
percent
rating
from
planned
parenthood
she
also
said
during
this
interview
that
her
views
on
abortion
were
libertarian
yet
she
supports
federal
funding
of
abortion
in
a
tweet
tuesday
morning
rubin
said
that
old
school
liberals
libertarians
and
conservatives
had
told
him
that
while
they
don't
agree
with
her
gabbard
they
respect
her
progressives
however
he
said
had
been
screeching
that
she's
a
sell-out
evil
right-wing
maniac
what
about
open
borders
gabbard
also
criticized
her
fellow
candidates
for
pushing
for
what
she
saw
as
open
borders
policies
on
immigration
i
don't
support
open
borders
she
said
without
secure
borders
we
don't
really
have
a
country
and
while
some
of
the
other
democratic
candidates
will
say
well
open
borders
that's
a
conservative
argument
and
that's
not
really
what's
being
advocated
for
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
practical
implications
of
some
of
the
things
they
are
pushing
for
it
is
essentially
open
borders
she
said
that
she
thought
the
country
needed
secure
borders
although
she
did
not
believe
that
president
trump's
proposed
border
wall
across
the
entire
southern
border
was
the
most
effective
way
to
accomplish
this
goal
what
are
gabbard's
chances
in
according
to
the
real
clear
politics
average
gabbard
is
currently
polling
at
percent
that's
lower
than
all
democratic
candidates
this
cycle
except
for
amy
klobuchar
percent
julian
castro
percent
bill
de
blasio
percent
and
tom
steyer
percent
