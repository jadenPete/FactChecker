florida
judge
denies
parents
custody
of
cancer-stricken
child
substantial
risk
of
imminent
neglect
probably
not
what
they
had
in
mind
a
florida
judge
denied
joshua
mcadams
and
taylor
bland-ball
custody
of
their
year-old
son
noah
who
has
cancer
mcadams
and
bland-ball
previously
insisted
that
they
would
pursue
alternative
avenues
of
treatment
for
their
son
beyond
conventional
medicine
in
response
a
court
removed
the
child
from
the
couple's
custody
what
are
the
details
hillsborough
county
judge
thomas
palermo
concluded
that
year-old
noah
would
remain
in
the
care
of
his
maternal
grandmother
and
continue
chemotherapy
treatment
in
april
the
court
ordered
that
the
child
would
undergo
such
therapy
for
his
diagnosis
of
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
which
is
a
cancer
of
the
blood
and
bone
previously
mcadams
and
bland-ball
permitted
noah
to
go
through
two
rounds
of
chemotherapy
which
took
place
over
a
period
of
just
days
before
declaring
him
free
of
cancer
cells
the
couple
refused
to
follow
up
with
the
life-saving
medical
care
of
chemotherapy
and
left
the
state
of
florida
to
seek
out
alternative
holistic
treatments
for
their
son
the
couple
opted
to
treat
the
child
with
cbd
oils
vitamins
and
an
alkaline
diet
police
obtained
an
emergency
order
to
take
noah
into
child
protective
services
and
the
child
was
placed
in
the
care
of
his
maternal
grandmother
police
took
mcadams
and
bland-ball
into
custody
on
charges
of
child
neglect
the
two
smiled
broadly
as
they
posed
for
their
mugshots
during
an
august
court
hearing
the
judge
questioned
the
parental
fitness
of
mcadams
and
bland-ball
according
to
the
daily
mail
the
court
heard
that
when
bland-ball
and
mcadams
removed
noah
from
treatment
he
had
a
picc
line
in
him
which
is
essentially
a
thin
soft
tube
which
is
inserted
into
a
large
vein
in
either
the
arm
leg
or
neck
and
carries
blood
to
the
heart
that
can
be
extremely
dangerous
to
remove
bland-ball
admitted
that
she
took
out
the
line
and
said
that
she
was
comfortable
doing
so
because
she
watched
a
video
on
youtube
anything
else
prosecutors
also
brought
up
previous
incidents
of
mcadams
alleged
domestic
violence
authorities
arrested
mcadams
in
on
a
misdemeanor
battery
charge
after
he
reportedly
struck
bland-ball
with
a
plastic
toy
while
she
was
holding
noah
the
toy
reportedly
struck
noah
in
the
face
and
cut
him
mcadams
also
purportedly
shoved
bland-ball
against
a
wall
multiple
times
the
case
was
dropped
in
the
daily
mail
also
reported
that
palermo
insisted
that
if
noah
was
returned
to
his
parents
care
he
would
be
at
substantial
risk
of
imminent
neglect
and
remaining
with
his
grandparents
was
the
only
way
to
ensure
noah's
health
safety
and
well-being
mcadams
and
bland-ball
could
potentially
regain
custody
by
working
with
the
state's
child
protective
agency
to
meet
all
of
the
requirements
set
by
the
court
