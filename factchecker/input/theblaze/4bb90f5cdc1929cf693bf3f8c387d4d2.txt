obliterates
electoral

malarkey
pushed
by
dnc
msnbc
aoc
but
i
repeat
myself
a
narrow
majority
deciding
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
the
country
that's
how
republican
dan
crenshaw
explains
the
future
that
democrats
and
progressives
not
only
want
but
are
actively
seeking
on
multiple
fronts
including
in
their
sudden
but
obsessive
push
to
eliminate
the
electoral
college
here
at
the
blaze
we
have
covered
the
electoral
college
destruction
movement
extensively
recently
in
the
forefront
have
been
democratic
congresswoman
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
who
characterized
it
as
affirmative
action
for
farmers
msnbc's
chris
hayes
who
gave
a
rambling
and
spectacularly
wrong
explanation
of
how
the
electoral
college
ought
to
be
un-constitutional
despite
being
put
in
place
by
the
people
who
wrote
the
constitution
and
oh
by
the
way
is
in
it
and
new
york
times
columnist
jamelle
bouie
who
in
a
column
this
week
specifically
named
crenshaw
in
an
attack
article
claiming
that
republicans
don't
understand
democracy
and
laughably
that
aoc
does
rep
crenshaw
responded
on
saturday
with
a
brief
but
perfect
response
to
bouie's
preposterous
assertion
nyt's
jamelle
bouie
and
msnbc's
chris
hayes
take
a
swing
and
miss
badly
let's
break
down
their
bad
arguments
for
abolishing
the
electoral

for
those
who
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
social
media
you
may
be
wondering
how
such
a
calmly
delivered
mild-mannered
explanation
of
such
a
matter-of-fact
topic
by
crenshaw
can
be
described
as
obliterating
the
overwrought
nyt
column
or
near-hysterical
hayes
and
aoc
rants
but
that's
your
internet
instinct
misguiding
you
it
is
precisely
because
it
so
calm
and
matter-of-fact
and
correct
not
to
mention
near-inarguable
that
it
is
an
obliteration
of
their
theatrics
the
electoral
college
is
often
portrayed
as
confusing
and
convoluted
when
discussed
on
democrat
networks
like
cnn
or
msnbc
but
that
is
just
part
of
their
agreed-upon
strategy
to
get
rid
of
it
so
the
places
where
they
live
have
more
say
in
fact
it
is
not
a
difficult
concept
it's
an
obvious
safeguard
against
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
just
as
the
founders
wanted
it
to
be
just
as
rep
crenshaw
describes
it
the
meaning
and
function
are
plain
and
easy
to
express
and
anyone
who
actually
holds
american
values
such
as
those
of
equality
and
fairness
individuality
freedom
and
the
check
on
centralized
federal
power
will
instantly
grasp
its
utility
with
only
the
barest
explanation
everything
else
is
a
smokescreen
and
in
cutting
through
that
smokescreen
rep
dan
crenshaw
has
once
again
proved
an
invaluable
voice
