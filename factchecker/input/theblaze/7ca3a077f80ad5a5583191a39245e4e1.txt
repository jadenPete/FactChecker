used
the
shooting
of
six
police
officers
wednesday
to
blast
the
national
rifle
association
and
push
for
gun
control
our
officers

kenney
said
during
a
news
conference
they
need
help
with
keeping
these
weapons
out
of
these
people's
hands
the
democrat
added
that
this
government
on
both
the
federal
and
state
level
don't
want
to
do
anything
about
getting
these
guns
off
the
streets
and
getting
them
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
this
guy
is
clearly
a
criminal
he
had
apparently
a
long
record
has
been
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
system
before
and
he
was
able
to
get
these
weapons
and
a
large
magazine
a
large
amount
of
bullets
more
from
kenney
so
whether
it's
our
six
officers
who
were
shot
or
it's
some
year-old
kid
on
the
streets
of
philadelphia
who
gets
shot
with
guns
that
shouldn't
be
in
people's
hands
it's
aggravating
it's
saddening
and
it's
just
something
we
need
to
do
something
about
and
if
the
state
and
federal
government
don't
want
to
stand
up
to
the
nra
and
some
other
folks
then
let
us
police
ourselves
but
they
preempt
us
on
all
kinds
of
gun
control
legislation
our
officers
deserve
to
be
protected
and
they
don't
deserve
to
be
shot
at
by
a
guy
for
hours
with
an
unlimited
supply
of
weapons
and
an
unlimited
supply
of
bullets
so
it's
disgusting
we
need
to
do
something
about
it
quickly

president
john
mcnesby
spoke
after
kenney
kyw-tv
reported
and
said
we
can't
have
this
too
many
guns
out
there
all
six
officers
who
were
shot
were
released
from
the
hospital
the
station
said
astounding
that
officers
in

weren't
killed
philly
commissioner
says
youtu
be
what
do
we
know
about
the
suspect
police
sources
told
the
philadelphia
inquirer
the

in
the
shooting
is
maurice
hill
who
has
long
history
of
gun
convictions
and
resisting
attempts
to
bring
him
to
justice
the
standoff
began
wednesday
about
p
m
when
a
narcotics
strike
force
unit
tried
to
serve
a
search
warrant
at
a
house
on
the
block
of
north
th
street
the
paper
said
the
suspect
opened
fire
at
that
time
kyw-tv
reported
what
else
has
kenney
said
and
done
just
before
christmas
last
year
kenney
called
on
store
owners
to
remove
realistic
toy
guns
from
shelves
the
mayor
said
in
july
that
philadelphia
no
longer
would
grant
ice
access
to
its
real-time
arrest
database
saying
the
agency
has
abused
it
to
target
illegal
immigrants
who
aren't
committing
any
other
crimes
he
also
noted
that
he
stands
for
the
national
anthem
because
he's
a
privileged
white
male
and
called
president
donald
trump
a
fragile
egomaniac
obsessed
with
crowd
size
over
the
president's
decision
to
rescind
the
philadelphia
eagles
invitation
to
visit
the
white
house
after
the
team's
super
bowl
win
because
the
eagles
decided
to
send
only
a
handful
of
players
after
police
confirmed
that
a
suspect
who
attempted
to
execute
a
philadelphia
police
officer
in
claimed
to
have
done
so
in
the
name
of
islam
kenney
told
reporters
the
attack
wasn't
connected
to
islam
in
any
way
