after

untimely
death
reneau

submitted
her
two

notice
of
resignation
earlier

last
shift

danny
baker
reneau
answered
stevens
who
called
to
report
a
severe
emergency
in
the
recording
stevens
can
be
heard
saying
my
vehicle
veered
off
the
road
while
i
was
delivering
newspapers
and
i'm
flooded
over
here
on
the
end
of
kinkead
and
it's
all
the
way
up
to
my
windows
and
i
can't
get
out
and
i'm
scared
to
death
ma'am
can
you
please
help
me
stevens
goes
on
to
tell
reneau
who
says
she
is
contacting
officers
for
assistance
that
water
is
starting
to
flood
the
vehicle
through
its
windows
and
she
is
unable
to
exit
stevens
who
tells
reneau
that
she
can't
swim
becomes
increasingly
frantic
as
the
floodwaters
rise
reneau
tries
to
locate
stevens
and
tells
her
that
she's
got
to
have
at
least
a
little
bit
of
an
idea
where
she
is
since
she'd
been
delivering
newspapers
it's
going
to
take
a
minute
reneau
says
pointing
out
that
she
doesn't
have
an
officer
available
at
the
moment
to
assist
stevens
who
is
becoming
more
upset
each
passing
second
reneau
tells
stevens
that
she
can't
do
anything
to
allay
her
fears
as
she
is
sitting
in
a
chair
you're
going
to
have
to
hold
on
reneau
insists
while
telling
officers
that
stevens
vehicle
is
filling
up
with
water
stevens
complains
that
there's
no
one
helping
her
a
statement
to
which
reneau
responds
am
i
not
on
the
phone
with
you
trying
to
get
you
some
help
crying
stevens
says
her
brand-new
phone
is
about
to
die
reneau
fires
back
do
you
really
care
about
your
brand-new
phone
you're
over
there
crying
for
your
life
stevens
goes
on
to
ask
reneau
to
pray
with
her
reneau
tells
stevens
to
go
ahead
and
start
the
prayer
much
of
what
stevens
says
is
unclear
beyond
dear
father
help
me
stevens
tells
reneau
that
the
water
has
risen
to
her
chest
and
that
she
believes
she
will
die
reneau
responds
by
admonishing
stevens
for
driving
through
floodwaters
this
will
teach
you
next
time
don't
drive
in
the
water
she
says
i
don't
see
how
you
didn't
see
it
you
had
to
go
right
over
it
stevens
profusely
apologizes
saying
i'm
sorry
ma'am
i
didn't
see
it
i
was
in
the
parking
lot
there
was
no
water
where
i
was
when
i
was
getting
out
of
the
parking
lot
i
was
looking
for
the
main
road
to
get
out
and
as
i
got
out
to
the
main
road
it
was
too
late
i
couldn't
see
it
there
won't
be
a
next
time
however
because
stevens
ends
up
drowning
alone
in
her
car
in
a
panic
stevens
says
that
she
will
disconnect
the
line
to
call
a
family
member
for
help
you're
going
to
make
her
drive
out
in
all
of
this
reneau
incredulously
asks
at
this
point
stevens
says
the
water
is
up
to
her
neck
and
is
getting
higher
and
higher
reneau
reveals
that
there
is
a
first
responder
near
the
scene
but
that
he
cannot
locate
her
in
the
flood
waters
the
vehicle
begins
to
move
on
its
own
through
the
waters
and
as
the
water
rises
she
can
be
heard
yelling
i
can't
breathe
reneau
insists
that
stevens
is
apparently
breathing
just
fine
because
she
is
screaming
at
her
and
demands
she
calm
down
as
stevens
apparently
slips
under
water
she
can
be
heard
making
gurgling
sounds
miss
debbie
miss
debbie
reneau
can
be
heard
saying
on
the
recording
she's
under
water
now
a
release
on
the
incident
says
that
when
first
responders
were
finally
able
to
reach
mrs
stevens
and
extract
her
from
the
vehicle
she
had
tragically
succumbed
to
drowning
according
to
the
times
record
stevens
was
known
to
most
people
as
debbie
a
servant-hearted
woman
with
a
kind
spirit
she
was
involved
in
a
preschool
church
ministry
at
a
local
church
city
director
neal
martin
lamented
the
loss
of
stevens
saying
that
she
was
a
model
of
being
a
servant
doing
what
god
called
you
to
do
and
serving
your
community
and
friends
what
happened
after
she
passed
in
a
thursday
news
conference
baker
said
there
wouldn't
be
an
internal
investigation
because
reneau
is
no
longer
an
employee
obviously
we
can't
investigate
someone
who
no
longer
works
here
he
said
however
we've
launched
an
investigation
into
our
responses
our
policies
our
dispatch
center
i've
been
in
communication
with
the
fire
chief
and
we're
looking
at
how
we
can
enhance
our
training
for
our
dispatchers
baker
said
nine
officers
were
patrolling
the
city
when
stevens
called
in
four
dispatchers
were
answering
seven
different
phone
lines
at
the
time
of
the
call
police
captain
wes
milam
condemned
reneau's
tone
with
stevens
we
field
rudeness
complaints
regularly
from
our
officers
and
our
dispatchers
and
i
certainly
don't
tolerate
it
i
don't
want
us
interacting
with
anyone
in
that
way
whether
it's
a
life
or
death
situation
or
not
baker
said
during
the
news
event
that's
certainly
something
we
have
to
look
at
and
examine
baker
added
i
don't
think
other
than
family
and
friends
that
there's
anybody
more
heartbroken
over
the
outcome
of
this
incident
than
me
the
members
of
the
police
department
the
fire
department
the
dispatchers
we
want
to
save
lives
that's
what
we're
about
and
when
we're
not
successful
in
doing
that
it
hurts
it
hurts
to
the
core
i
believe
that
everything
was
done
that
was
humanly
possible
given
the
circumstances
and
at
that
time
to
save
ms
stevens
life
i
am
horribly
sorry
that
wasn't
possible
reneau
has
yet
to
publicly
comment
on
the
matter
