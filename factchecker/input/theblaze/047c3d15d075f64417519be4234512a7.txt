bush
told
the
daily
beast
in
an
interview
published
friday
i'd
never
seriously
do
it
because
i
have
children
that
matter
but
when
you're
really
low
and
this
is
important
to
include
you're
emoting
at
the
most
extreme
but
i'm
never
ever
a
serious
candidate
for
that
he
elaborated
i
would
not
could
not
do
that
to
those
who
count
on
me
and
love
me
and
need
me
absolutely
not
bush
continued
indicating
that
anyone
who
says
they
would
commit
suicide
likely
would
not
but
you
think
oh
i
would
do
it
no
no
you
won't
he
insisted
but
you're
upset
look
everybody
has
something
everybody
has
something
that
is
really
really
deeply
upsetting
and
if
you
haven't
you
will
that's
for
sure
and
i
may
have
something
again
i
hope
i'm
conditioned
to
take
a
deep
breath
acknowledge
the
feelings
and
know
that
they're
not
here
to
stay
he
told
the
outlet
that
he
entered
a
downward
spiral
of
drinking
and
depression
yeah
at
the
beginning
it
was
numb
numb
numb
the
former
host
said
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
life
and
i
think
i've
gotten
pretty
close
that
life
is
lived
in
the
middle
i
have
been
really
high
in
life
and
i've
been
really
low
now
really
low
like
all
the
way
low
bush
complained
that
even
as
recent
as
christmas
he
felt
lost
and
abandoned
kinda
like
where's
my
industry
where's
my
life
what
am
i
doing
here
he
recalled
he
said
that
a
book
changed
his
perspective
entirely
it
was
christmas
eve
and
i
ended
up
reading
a
book
called
the
purpose
of
christmas
by
rick
warren
he
continued
and
i
felt
this
unbelievably
overpowering
presence
come
over
me
and
it
took
me
from
the
deepest
feelings
of
despair
to
a
warm
glow
of
everything's
gonna
be
just
fine
a
very
powerful
moment
and
i
won't
forget
it
bush
is
now

new
anchor
and
managing
editor
