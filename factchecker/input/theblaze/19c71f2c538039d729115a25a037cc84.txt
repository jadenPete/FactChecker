oh
brother
actor
johnny
depp
has
spoken
out
against
the
outrage
sparked
by
dior's
latest
ad
for
perfume
sauvage
the
advertisement
stirred
up
controversy
for
many
people
after
its
release
with
critics
calling
the
video
nothing
more
than
cultural
appropriation
the
ad
which
features
depp
and
a
native
american
dancer
was
also
criticized
for
the
exploitation
of
indigenous
cultures
the
design
house
initially
released
the
ad
on
social
media
with
a
caption
that
read
an
authentic
journey
deep
into
the
native
american
soul
in
a
sacred
founding
and
secular
territory
after
much
outcry
dior
pulled
the
advertisement
and
issued
a
statement
of
apology
the
statement
read
so
what
did
depp
say
about
all
this
the
long-time
actor
expressed
his
disappointment
with
the
reaction
to
the
ad
during
a
recent
film
festival
according
to
the
hollywood
reporter
there
was
never
and
how
could
there
be
or
how
would
there
be
any
dishonorable
intent
depp
said
the
short
film
was
made
with
a
great
respect
for
the
indigenous
people
not
just
of
north
america
but
all
over
the
world
it's
a
pity
that
people
jumped
the
gun
and
made
these
objections
however
their
objections
are
their
objections
depp
also
pointed
out
that
the
project's
creative
team
worked
side
by
side
with
comanche
nation
as
well
as
other
indigenous
advocacy
groups
to
stay
true
to
the
concept
during
the
film's
creation
i
can
assure
you
that
no
one
has
any
reason
to
go
out
to
try
to
exploit
he
insisted
it
was
a
film
made
out
of
great
respect
and
with
great
respect
and
love
for
the
native
american
peoples
to
bring
light
to
them
they
haven't
had
the
greatest
amount
of
help
out
of
the
united
states
government
the
idea
is
as
pure
as
it
ever
was
so
we
will
come
to
an
agreement
so
that
everyone
is
happy
