maxwell's
father
posted
a
clip
on
facebook
over
the
weekend
of
the
boys
running
toward
each
other
to
embrace
before
tearing
off
together
down
the
sidewalk
abc

picked
up
the
footage
and
it
went
viral
with
even
the
likes
of
former
u.s.
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
nikki
haley
sharing
it
on
twitter
with
the
message
this
makes
my
heart
happy
hope
it
does
yours
as
well
cisneros
told
the
outlet
when
they
are
away
from
each
other
they
are
always
asking
about
one
another
they
go
to
music
class
together
dana
banana
a
weekly
music
event
and
they
love
to
dance
both
are
excellent
dancers
anything
else
while
most
on
social
media
had
positive
comments
to
share
there
were
critics
too
some
voiced
concern
that
the
adults
weren't
close
enough
in
case
the
kids
darted
into
the
street
and
others
accused
the
parents
of
setting
up
the
encounter
definitely
not
staged
it's
just
a
lucky
moment
that
i
caught
on
camera
cisneros
told
wpix-tv
they
just
took
off
towards
each
other
and
i
got
my
phone
out
as
quickly
as
i
can
to
record
it
they
are
just
too
cute
together
