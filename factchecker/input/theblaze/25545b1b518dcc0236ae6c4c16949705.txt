if
donald
trump
wins
again
in
he
ll
have
the
democratic
party
to
thank
radicalism
doesn't
sell
the
united
states
faces
a
potentially
life-changing
election
in
even
more
so
than
in
on
the
one
hand
americans
have
president
donald
trump
whose
tweets
and
antics
have
long
been
criticized
by
those
on
the
left
and
the
right
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
democratic
party
a
party
that
embraces
socialism
and
radical
forms
of
gun
control
refuses
to
denounce
anti-semitism
in
its
freshmen
members
and
advocates
for
abortion
up
until
birth
no
longer
do
democrats
chant
that
abortion
should
be
safe
legal
and
rare
it
used
to
be
said
that
the
two
parties
in
america
had
the
same
goal
but
with
different
methods
of
achieving
it
those
days
are
long
gone
each
day
the
democratic
party's
platform
moves
further
and
further
away
from
individual
liberty
and
personal
responsibility
with
a
field
of
democratic
candidates
hell-bent
on
seeing
who
can
promise
the
most
free
stuff
it's
time
for
a
wake-up
call
it's
donald
trump
or
the
party
that
has
made
it
clear
that
we
are
not
welcome
among
them
in
the
age
of
identity
politics
the
left
is
pushing
conservatives
to
either
get
on
board
or
get
out
of
the
way
there
is
no
room
for
dissent
or
challenge
among
today's
democratic
party
try
and
you'll
be
called
nazi
bigot
or
something
worse
no
one
is
immune
while
the
party
platform
becomes
more
and
more
radical
its
candidates
are
racing
to
see
who
can
alienate
voters
the
most
candidates
like
sens
kamala
harris
calif
elizabeth
warren
mass
and
bernie
sanders
vt
have
all
promised
varying
degrees
of
the
abolition
of
private
insurance
and
medicare-for-all
harris
a
democrat
desperate
to
get
ahead
in
the
polls
recently
called
for
gun
confiscation
for
those
deemed
unfit
to
own
a
weapon
both
harris
and
warren
among
others
have
called
for
reparations
for
blacks
and
native
americans
warren
and
sanders
have
duked
it
out
over
the
push
for
cancellation
of
student
loan
debt
sanders
plan
would
forgive
all
of
the
student
loan
debt
in
america
costing
a
whopping
trillion
approximately
billion
more
than
total
credit
card
debt
warren's
plan
on
the
other
hand
would
take
care
of
a
portion
of
student
loan
debt
for
percent
of
people
and
all
student
loan
debt
for
percent
of
people
her
plan
is
income-based
while
the
democrats
argue
over
who
can
spend
more
taxpayer
dollars
quicker
the
national
debt
has
raced
past
trillion
studies
show
that
while
younger
americans
are
warming
up
to
socialism
older
voters
independents
and
moderates
are
shying
away
from
the
radical
ideology
all
the
democrats
have
to
do
to
win
in
is
not
be
insane
and
they
can't
do
it
while
trump's
tweets
and
rhetoric
are
often
condemnatory
and
completely
unnecessary
a
more
dangerous
foe
lies
in
wait
should
he
lose
in
donald
trump
is
the
devil
we
know
and
he
won't
be
president
forever
in
many
conservatives
and
independents
voted
against
hillary
clinton
in
what
should
have
been
the
easiest
presidential
election
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
in
i'm
not
voting
for
donald
trump
i'm
voting
against
the
radicalized
democratic
party
