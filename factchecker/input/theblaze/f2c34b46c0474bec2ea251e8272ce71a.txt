offers
sober
response
to
alyssa
milano
s
claim
that
her
abortions
helped
to
usher
in
her
life
s
great
joys
focusing
on
true
joy
pastor
jarrid
wilson
of
harvest
christian
fellowship
took
actress
and
activist
alyssa
milano
to
task
over
her
previous
remarks
celebrating
her
multiple
abortions
earlier
this
month
milano
revealed
she
had
two
abortions
in
her
s
which
she
said
freed
her
up
to
enjoy
life
on
a
greater
scale
in
remarks
made
during
a
podcast
she
declared
that
her
life
would
be
completely
lacking
all
its
great
joys
if
it
weren't
for
her
choice
to
abort
her
unborn
children
wilson
who
is
also
founder
of
nonprofit
organization
anthem
of
hope
created
a
viral
hashtag
taking
a
positive
spin
on
milano's
remarks
greatjoys
what
are
the
details
wilson
shared
a
photo
of
his
children
on
twitter
captioning
it
everyone
should
post
a
picture
of
their
kids
and
use
the
hashtag
greatjoys
at
the
time
of
this
writing
the
greatjoys
hashtag
has
been
used
numerous
times
and
renders
a
plethora
of
photos
of
smiling
children
all
across
twitter
what
else
in
an
interview
with
faithwire
wilson
said
that
children
are
a
blessing
from
god
and
should
be
treated
as
such
children
are
our
future
and
a
blessing
from
god
not
a
burden
that
so
many
people
specifically
people
who
are
only
focused
on
their
own
achievement
and
goals
make
them
out
to
be
wilson
said
wilson
added
that
people
need
to
stop
treating
children
and
pregnancy
like
they
are
disposable
commodities
i
believe
our
world
needs
to
stop
treating
them
that
way
he
explained
whether
milano
wants
to
admit
it
or
not
she
now
has
two
children
in
heaven
whom
she
will
never
experience
the
joy
of
parenting
despite
his
thoughts
on
milano's
sins
the
pastor
said
that
her
actions
are
forgivable
is
choosing
abortion
unforgivable
he
asked
not
at
all
but
i
believe
milano's
views
on
the
subject
to
be
both
harmful
and
mentally
disturbing
i
don't
know
milano
personally
wilson
continued
but
i'm
praying
she
really
thinks
about
the
totality
of
what
she's
saying
on
public
platforms
especially
in
regards
to
situations
that
encompass
the
reality
of
life
and
death
he
concluded
children
should
be
celebrated
not
looked
down
upon
