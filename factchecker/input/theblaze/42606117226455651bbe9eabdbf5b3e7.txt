egged
on
by
an
onlooker
threw
the
milk
the
video
shows
cops
ducking
as
the
container
heads
toward
them
but
the
milk
still
splatters
on
what
appears
to
be
a
fire
truck
as
well
as
on
the
officer's
uniform
and
the
cop
simply
stares
back
at
the
crowd
here's
the
clip
the
post
said
officers
chased
the
man
but
he
got
away
police
were
still
looking
for
him
thursday

he's
wanted
for
assault
four

officials
told
the

hurt
the
post
interviewed
one
building
resident
in
a
separate
story
who
said
police
were
pepper-spraying
the
crowd
and
that
milk
was
on
hand
to
alleviate
the
pain
nypd
officials
thursday
night
could
not
immediately
confirm
if
the
pepper-spraying
occurred
the
paper
said
people
got
mad
they
said
they
were
trying
to
get
back
into
the
building
one
resident
told
the
post
how
did
police
officials
respond
to
the
milk
throwing
the
police
benevolent
association
told
the
paper
that
city
leaders
are
to
blame
for
the
milk-throwing
incidents
and
related
acts
insisting
they've
created
a
cop-hating
environment
it
is
becoming
impossible
for
police
officers
to
do
our
job
even
in
emergency
situations
pba
president
patrick
j.
lynch
said
in
a
statement
the
post
reported
at
a
fire
scene
our
role
is
to
clear
the
area
so
that
firefighters
can
contain
the
fire
and
prevent
loss
of
life
this
crowd
didn't
care
they
wanted
to
fight
the
cops
who
were
there
to
help
lynch
continued
the
paper
noted
thankfully
everybody
made
it
out
this
time
but
our
city
leaders
need
to
wake
up
if
they
keep
encouraging
cop-hatred
and
interference
with
our
duties
lives
will
be
lost
because
we
were
prevented
from
doing
our
job
