a
student
challenges
bernie
sanders
on
his
hypocritical
fossil
fuel
use
and
he
does
not
like
it
practice
what
you
preach
a
student
challenged
presidential
candidate
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
to
practice
what
he
preaches
on
fossil
fuel
use
and
he
did
not
appreciate
the
question
much
the
interaction
occurred
thursday
during
a
question
and
answer
period
with
the
candidate
at
a
town
hall
event
in
chico
california
so
my
question
is
you
seem
adamant
about
climate
change
said
the
student
yeah
agreed
sanders
so
what
ways
would
you
take
to
practice
what
you
preach
if
you
were
to
become
president
the
student
asked
i
know
it's
stressful
and
you
have
to
travel
a
lot
he
added
you
have
to
use
fossil
fuels
no
i'm
not
gonna
walk
to
california
sanders
joked
to
laughter
from
the
audience
no
i
understand
that
we
do
the
best
we
can
as
an
example
but
i'm
not
gonna
sit
here
and
tell
you
that
i'm
not
gonna
use
fossil
fuels
he
added
the
admission
came
on
the
same
day
that
his
campaign
released
a
climate
change
plan
that
the
new
york
times
described
as
the
most
extreme
among
the
presidential
candidate
plans
climate
change
is
an
existential
threat
to
the
entire
country
and
the
entire
world
and
we
must
be
extraordinarily
aggressive
sanders
said
i
have
seven
grandchildren
he
added
and
i'm
going
to
be
damned
if
i'm
going
to
leave
them
a
planet
that
is
unhealthy
and
uninhabitable
sanders
is
currently
tied
with
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
for
second
place
behind
joe
biden
in
the
democratic
nomination
race
here's
the
video
of
the
interaction
