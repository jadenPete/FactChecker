eric
bolling
plays
marianne
williamson's
hot
mic
moment
blasting
liberals
praising
conservatives
and
she
isn't
happy
she
said
it
democratic
presidential
candidate
marianne
williamson
was
caught
being
rather
candid
during
a
hot
mic
conversation
saying
that
liberals
are
way
more
hostile
toward
her
than
conservatives
have
ever
been
williamson
made
the
remarks
in
question
two
weeks
ago
when
she
first
appeared
on
america
this
week
with
eric
bolling
according
to
williamson
she
only
agreed
to
appear
for
a
second
interview
after
blazetv
host
eric
bolling
promised
that
he
would
not
air
the
comments
what
are
the
details
during
the
initial
interview
with
bolling
williamson
during
a
hot
mic
moment
said
what
does
it
say
that
fox
news
is
nicer
to
me
than
the
lefties
are
what
does
it
say
that
the
conservatives
are
nicer
to
me
it's
such
a
bizarre
world
the
presidential
candidate
continued
you
know
i'm
such
a
lefty
i
mean
i'm
a
serious
lefty
but
they're
so
i
didn't
think
the
left
was
as
mean
as
the
right
they
are
during
the
second
interview
bolling
played
those
remarks
for
his
audience
clearly
taken
aback
williamson
said
well
what
i
was
told
was
that
if
i
came
on
your
show
you
wouldn't
blast
it
out
and
you
just
blasted
it
out
so
i
don't
even
know
where
to
go
with
that
williamson
continued
to
express
her
disappointment
that
the
remarks
were
aired
and
insisted
that
her
remarks
reflected
how
she
felt
on
that
very
day
williamson
previously
made
similar
remarks
during
an
interview
with
the
new
yorker
when
it
comes
to
the
rough
and
tumble
of
politics
and
how
people
behave
i
think
that
there
are
things
that
happen
just
in
people
it's
not
a
left-right
issue
and
i
have
found
it's
tough
out
there
she
told
bolling
and
i
was
just
talking
about
the
fact
that
that
day
you
were
certainly
very
kind
to
me
what
else
she
continued
insisting
that
there
are
people
on
the
left
who
are
civil
and
courteous
to
her
and
listen
many
people
on
the
left
are
kind
to
me
i'm
running
for
president
it's
not
a
walk
in
the
park
williamson
insisted
i
was
making
a
comment
that
i
found
my
life
that
day
you
know
the
republicans
don't
have
to
be
attacking
me
right
now
i'm
in
a
democratic
primary
so
republicans
are
hi
marianne
whereas
some
people
on
the
left
because
they're
working
for
other
candidates
i
understand
how
it
goes
that's
all
i
meant
