his
sexual
assault
accusers
over
their
allegations
what
are
the
details

says
that

defamation
by
airing

both
of

district
court
in
virginia's
eastern

both
allegations
had
not
been
corroborated
by
any
independent
investigation
yes
the
suit
reads
cbs
must
be
held
accountable
for
its
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
knowing
failure
to
follow
even
rudimentary
journalistic
standards
and
its
failure
to
follow
up
on
leads
that
would
demonstrate
the
allegations
to
be
false
the
suit
points
out
that
fairfax
intends
to
clear

the
litigation
fairfax
brings

clear
his

the
lawsuit
adds
in
a
statement
to
the
hill
a
spokesperson
for
cbs
said
we
stand
by
our
reporting
and
we
will
vigorously
defend
this
lawsuit
anything
else
in
february
fairfax
compared
the
allegations
to
terror
lynchings
during
an
impassioned
speech
before
the
state's
senate
fairfax's
controversial
remarks
came
in
response
to
remarks
made
by
senate
majority
leader
tommy
norment
r
who
told
the
lieutenant
governor
i
just
want
to
personally
thank
you
for
your
professionalism
the
manner
in
which
you
have
presided
over
the
senate
during
these
times
that
are
stressful
for
you
and
your
family
and
i
am
most
appreciative
of
your
even-handedness
your
gentile
manner
and
the
professionalism
which
you've
demonstrated
throughout
this
session
i've
heard
much
about
anti-lynching
on
the
floor
of
this
very
senate
where
people
were
not
given
any
due
process
whatsoever
and
we
rue
that
fairfax
responded
and
we
talk
about
hundreds
at
least
terror
lynchings
that
have
happened
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
under
those
very
same
auspices
and
yet
we
stand
here
in
a
rush
to
judgment
with
nothing
but
accusations
and
no
facts
and
we
decide
that
we
are
willing
to
do
the
same
thing
he
continued
if
we
go
backward
and
we
rush
to
judgment
and
we
allow
for
political
lynchings
without
any
due
process
any
facts
any
evidence
being
heard
then
i
think
we
do
a
disservice
to
this
very
body
in
which
we
all
serve
