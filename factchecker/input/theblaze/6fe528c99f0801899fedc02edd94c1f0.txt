gop
mess
rand
paul
and
liz
cheney
get
into
nasty
fight
following
john
bolton
ouster
this
got
really
ugly
when
president
donald
trump
announced
tuesday
that
he
had
fired
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
there
was
no
bigger
republican
cheerleader
of
the
move
than
sen
rand
paul
ky
after
news
broke
of
bolton's
departure
which
according
to
bolton
was
a
resignation
not
a
canning
paul
wrote
i
commend
realdonaldtrump
for
this
necessary
action
the
president
has
great
instincts
on
foreign
policy
and
ending
our
endless
wars
he
should
be
served
by
those
who
share
those
views
he
later
added
the
threat
of
war
around
the
world
has
been
greatly
diminished
with
john
bolton
out
of
the
white
house
paul
who
has
long
advocated
for
getting
u.s.
troops
out
of
afghanistan
further
labeled
bolton
a
neocon
and
lamented
that
neocons
continue
to
advocate
for
endless
wars
in
a
tweet
that
cited
a
washington
examiner
piece
blasting
rep
liz
cheney
r-wyo
for
carping
at
trump
for
his
refusal
to
go
after
iran
like
bolton
cheney
the
daughter
of
former
vice
president
and
sith
lord
if
the
american
left
is
to
be
believed
dick
cheney
has
traditionally
been
more
of
an
advocate
of
foreign
intervention
and
she
wasn't
about
to
let
paul's
statement
go
unanswered
i
stand
with
realdonaldtrump
and
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
will
never
surrender
to
terrorists
unlike
randpaul
who
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
today
is
she
tweeted
wednesday
they
weren't
done
thursday
paul
took
another
poke
at
cheney
tweeting
hi
liz
cheney
president
realdonaldtrump
hears
all
your
nevertrump
warmongering
we
all
see
your
pro-bolton
blather
i'm
just
grateful
for
a
president
who
unlike
you
supports
stopping
these
endless
wars
cheney
responded
with
a
personal-attack
roundhouse
hi
randpaul
i
know
the
race
was
painful
for
you
since
you
were
such
a
big
loser
then
now
with
a
dismal
in
iowa
she
wrote
no
surprise
since
your
motto
seems
to
be
terrorists
first
america
second
for
good
measure
she
included
a
tbt
aka
throwback
thursday
note
quoting
a
nasty
trump
tweet
about
paul
from
aug
which
said
truly
weird
senator
rand
paul
of
kentucky
reminds
me
of
a
spoiled
brat
without
a
properly
functioning
brain
he
was
terrible
at
debate
no
truer
words
were
ever
spoken
cheney
said
of
the
years-old
trump
slam
and
they
still
weren't
done
as
this
story
was
being
written
the
two
elected
officials
continued
paul
responded
to
cheney's
taunt
with
hey
liz
cheney
i
feel
like
you
might
just
be
mad
still
about
when
candidate
trump
shredded
your
dad's
failed
foreign
policy
and
endless
wars
cheney
attacked
again
with
a
personal
jab
saying
weird
i
don't
see
you
on
stage
here
randpaul
oh
right
my
bad
you
had
already
lost
she
closed
with
a
hashtag
insult
weirdrand
why
does
this
matter
first
of
all
they're
adults
second
they
are
elected
lawmakers
whose
daily
jobs
impact
the
lives
of
every
american
that
said
in
the
world
of
politics
it's
not
uncommon
for
elected
officials
to
say
nasty
things
about
each
other
even
intra-party
squabbles
can
happen
what
really
adds
intrigue
to
this
back-and-forth
is
that
cheney
is
currently
mulling
a
senate
bid
to
replace
sen
mike
enzi
who
announced
in
may
that
he
would
not
seek
reelection
next
year
if
cheney
who
has
built
up
power
within
the
republican
establishment
already
in
the
house
even
to
the
point
that
some
gopers
are
reportedly
urging
her
to
stay
in
the
house
for
a
possible
future
speakership
does
take
enzi's
seat
she
and
paul
could
be
at
loggerheads
in
the
upper
chamber
for
the
foreseeable
future
