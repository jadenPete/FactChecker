in

during
the

margaret
brennan
pointed
out
you
wrote
biden
exuded
the
confidence
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
made
up
perhaps
even
indifferent
to
considering
the
consequences
were
he
judging
the
situation
incorrectly
regarding
the
obama
administration's
decision
to
leave
iraq
well
mattis
responded
i
was
writing
a
history
book
at
that
point
margaret
because
i
started
writing
this
book
in
had
i
known
the
former
vice
president
was
going
to
run
for
office
i
assure
you
i
would
not
have
probably
been
that
forthcoming
in
the
book
mattis
wrote
that
the
decision
was
hasty
we
should
slowly
inch
the
wheels
up
allowing
the
iraqis
to
wobble
but
not
crash
as
they
slowly
pedaled
down
the
path
to
self-sufficiency
a
portion
of
this
book
read
according
to
the
washington
examiner
if
we
pulled
out
too
early
i
noted
we
would
have
to
bring
our
troops
back
in
brennan
responded
to
mattis
remarks
by
asking
mattis
if
he
had
questioned
biden's
judgment
i
think
the
obama
administration
president
obama's
administration
had
made
the
decision
to
leave
iraq
despite
what
the
intelligence
community
was
telling
us
what
would
happen
he
explained
they
were
very
clear
that
an
al-qaeda-associated
group
would
rise
that
the
iraqi
government
the
iraqi
people
the
iraqi
nation
was
in
a
post-combat
pre-reconciliation
phase
we
needed
to
keep
our
influence
there
a
little
longer
he
added
anything
else
elsewhere
in
the
book
mattis
wrote
i
found
biden
an
admirable
and
amiable
man
but
he
was
past
the
point
where
he
was
willing
to
entertain
a
good
idea
he
didn't
want
to
hear
more
he
wanted
our
forces
out
of
iraq
whatever
path
led
there
fastest
he
favored
