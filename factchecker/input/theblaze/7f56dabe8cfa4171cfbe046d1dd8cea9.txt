parkland
father
exposes
how
killer
was
enabled
by
obama's
school-leniency
policies
the
left
they
don't
want
to
hear
my
story
andrew
pollack
whose
daughter
meadow
was
a
victim
of
the
parkland
massacre
that
left
dead
is
on
a
mission
to
make
sure
other
parents
are
aware
of
what
failed
in
broward
county
so
that
future
school
tragedies
might
be
prevented
the
mourning
father
has
written
a
book
spelling
out
the
countless
red
flags
school
officials
and
law
enforcement
were
handed
regarding
the
deranged
murderer
who
took
the
lives
of
so
many
innocent
victims
including
meadow
and
says
policies
implemented
by
president
barack
obama
prevented
the
reporting
of
an
abundance
of
evidence
that
could
have
been
used
to
stop
his
daughter's
killer
what
are
the
details
pollack
and
the
co-author
of
his
book
why
meadow
died
the
people
and
policies
that
created
the
parkland
shooter
and
endanger
america's
students
provided
an
excerpt
published
recently
by
the
new
york
post
giving
a
chilling
account
of
records
detailing
the
classroom
behavior
of
the
accused
parkland
murderer
nikolas
cruz
the
piece
goes
through
a
litany
of
events
which
although
apparently
disturbing
enough
for
cruz's
teachers
to
report
in
their
notes
were
either
never
reported
to
or
dismissed
by
proper
authorities
one
noteworthy
example
was
that
cruz's
psychiatrist
insisted
her
patient
should
not
be
admitted
in
to
jrotc
citing
the
safety
of
others
himself
but
he
was
nonetheless
enrolled
in
the
program
and
literally
given
an
air
gun
shaped
like
an
ar-
and
allowed
to
practice
shooting
on
wednesday
pollack
explained
to
fox
news's
tucker
carlson
a
specific
example
of
how
policies
implemented
by
the
obama
administration
contributed
to
cruz
slipping
through
the
cracks
students
were
allowed
four
misdemeanors
per
school
year
without
being
introduced
to
the
judicial
system
pollack
said
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
if
you
can
believe
this
tucker
so
that
was
in
the
ninth
grade
you
had
a
kid
next
to
your
kid
in
the
classroom
commits
four
misdemeanors
and
then
the
next
year
in
tenth
grade
he
resets
at
zero
again
and
is
allowed
another
four
misdemeanors
per
school
year
pollack
conceded
the
left
they
don't
want
to
hear
my
story
they
want
to
blame
the
big
old
black
scary
gun
but
that
didn't
happen
in
broward
a
report
from
realclearinvestigations
earlier
this
year
gives
an
abundance
of
evidence
supporting
pollack's
claims
reiterating
that
the
policies
set
forth
by
president
obama
and
carried
out
by
broward
school
superintendent
robert
runcie
a
chicogoan
and
harvard
graduate
with
close
ties
to
president
obama
and
his
education
department
were
behind
cruz's
florida
rampage
the
rci
piece
details
how
broward
was
seen
as
an
example
of
obama's
mission
to
end
the
school-to-prison
pipeline
implementing
changes
that
assured
students
charged
with
various
misdemeanors
including
assault
would
now
be
disciplined
through
participation
in
healing
circles
obstacle
courses
and
other
self-esteem
building
exercises
rather
than
being
reported
to
authorities
a
veteran
fbi
agent
told
the
outlet
of
cruz
he
had
a
clean
record
so
alarm
bells
didn't
go
off
when
they
looked
him
up
in
the
system
he
probably
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
buy
the
murder
weapon
if
the
school
had
referred
him
to
law
enforcement
