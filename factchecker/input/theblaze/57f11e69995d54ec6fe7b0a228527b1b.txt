jennifer
aniston's
tanned
skin
tone
prompts
cries
of
blackface
and
comparisons
to
former
naacp
chapter
leader
rachel
dolezal
can't
make
this
stuff
up
instyle
magazine
is
under
fire
after
featuring
a
photo
of
actress
jennifer
aniston
looking
tanner
than
normal
what
are
the
details
the
magazine
shared
one
of
aniston's
covers
to
instagram
on
wednesday
prompting
heavy
backlash
from
social
media
users
as
highlighted
by
the
los
angeles
times
one
commenter
wrote
when
we
asked
for
south
asian
representation
in
the
media
this
isn't
what
we
meant
another
added
blackface
i
didn't
know
she
was
a
person
of
color
yet
another
user
wrote
one
person
even
took
it
as
a
shot
to
marginalizing
women
of
color
in
the
fashion
and
beauty
industry
i
get
that
these
covers
are
supposed
to
be
channeling
the
glamour
of
yesteryear
but
that
glamour
routinely
marginalized
women
of
color
for
white
women
whether
made
tan
or
otherwise
seeing
jennifer
aniston
several
shades
darker
than
normal
reminds
me
of
that
legacy
in
if
you
want
a
brown-skinned
woman
on
your
cover
put
a
brown-skinned
woman
on
your
cover
another
commenter
added
another
added
y'all
that
thought
it
would
be
ok
to
have
a
very
brown
jennifer
aniston
on
your
cover
another
user
said
that
aniston's
tan
was
nothing
more
than
brown
face
you
can
totally
stretch
your
boundaries
without
doing
brown
face
though
so
the
user
wrote
according
to
nbc
news
some
commenters
even
compared
aniston
to
embattled
former
naacp
leader
rachel
dolezal
who
though
born
white
has
repeatedly
insisted
that
she
is
black
the
magazine
chose
aniston
as
its
cover
model
to
promote
its
october
issue
and
captioned
the
offending
photo
