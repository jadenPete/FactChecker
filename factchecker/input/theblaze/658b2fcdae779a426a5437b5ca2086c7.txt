the
taliban
vowed
sunday
that
president
donald
trump's
decision
to
cancel
a
secret
meeting
with
taliban
leadership
would
cost
the
white
house
more
american
lives
now
that
u.s.
president
trump
has
announced
the
suspension
of
negotiations
with
the
islamic
emirate
this
would
not
harm
anyone
else
but
the
americans
themselves
taliban
spokesman
zabihullah
mujahid
said
in
a
statement
this
will
lead
to
more
losses
to
the
u.s.
mujahid
continued
reuters
reported
its
credibility
will
be
affected
its
anti-peace
stance
will
be
exposed
to
the
world
losses
to
lives
and
assets
will
increase
promises
for
increased
violence
come
after
trump
revealed
over
the
weekend
that
he
had
been
planning
to
meet
with
taliban
leadership
and
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
in
separate
meetings
at
camp
david
to
finalize
peace
talks
between
the
warring
groups
but
trump
cancelled
the
meeting
after
taliban
terrorists
killed
u.s.
army
sgt
st
class
elis
a.
barreto
ortiz
from
morovis
puerto
rico
in
a
bombing
last
week
unbeknownst
to
almost
everyone
the
major
taliban
leaders
and
separately
the
president
of
afghanistan
were
going
to
secretly
meet
with
me
at
camp
david
on
sunday
they
were
coming
to
the
united
states
tonight
trump
said
on
saturday
unfortunately
in
order
to
build
false
leverage
they
admitted
to
an
attack
in
kabul
that
killed
one
of
our
great
great
soldiers
and
other
people
i
immediately
cancelled
the
meeting
and
called
off
peace
negotiations
what
kind
of
people
would
kill
so
many
in
order
to
seemingly
strengthen
their
bargaining
position
negotiations
between
the
u.s.
afghanistan
american
allies
and
the
taliban
have
been
ongoing
for
some
time
the
result
of
which
would
be
increased
peace
and
stability
in
the
region
along
with
the
withdrawal
of
u.s.
troops
from
afghanistan
zalmay
khalilzad
the
u.s.
envoy
negotiating
with
the
taliban
said
last
week
the
two
sides
had
come
to
an
agreement
in
principle
and
only
required
trump's
approval
to
be
finalized
it's
not
clear
whether
the
agreement
stands
after
trump's
decision
to
cancel
the
meetings
however
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
sunday
the
u.s.
remains
committed
to
achieving
an
agreement
to
end
the
afghanistan
war
