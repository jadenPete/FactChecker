they
can
do
enormous
damage
to
the

very
very
seriously
i
know
the
district
attorney
takes
it
very
seriously
said
detective
mike
hebert
with

we'll
walk
it
over
to
the

a
customer
wants
to
leave
the
impression
that
they
left
behind
adulterated
product
we
will
move
quickly
with
law
enforcement
to
identify
apprehend
and
prosecute
those
who
think
this
is
a
joke-it
is
not
