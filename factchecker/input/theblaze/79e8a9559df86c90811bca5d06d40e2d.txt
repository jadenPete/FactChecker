walmart
announces
plan
to
ban
military
style
rifle
ammunition
and
handgun
ammunition
will
ask
customers
not
to
open
carry
in
stores
we
know
these
decisions
will
inconvenience
some
of
our
customers
and
we
hope
they
will
understand
update
in
response
to
this
article
a
representative
from
walmart
reached
out
to
theblaze
for
clarification
as
to
whether
open
carry
would
be
banned
in
walmart
stores
with
the
following
statement
it's
not
exactly
accurate
to
say
open
carry
is
banned
what
we
are
doing
is
asking
people
not
to
do
it
we
will
treat
law-abiding
customers
with
respect
and
we
will
have
a
very
non-confrontational
approach
our
first
priority
is
safety
we
will
be
providing
new
signage
to
help
communicate
this
policy
in
the
coming
weeks
we
reached
back
out
to
walmart
and
asked
for
further
clarification
what
would
happen
if
a
customer
refused
their
request
not
to
open
carry
regardless
of
how
polite
that
request
was
phrased
in
response
the
walmart
representative
answered
we
will
respectfully
request
that
they
do
not
carry
the
discretion
will
be
given
to
the
store
manager
if
there
is
not
imminent
threat
the
sm
can
ask
them
to
leave
the
weapon
in
the
vehicle
for
next
time
if
the
customer
is
causing
concern
or
fear
with
customers
associates
the
store
manager
can
then
approach
the
customer
and
or
follow
necessary
protocols
for
a
potential
active
shooter
in
some
states
open
carry
is
very
common
so
again
some
discretion
will
be
given
to
the
store
manager
the
headline
has
been
updated
in
light
of
this
clarification
one
of
the
nation's
largest
retailers
is
making
some
drastic
changes
to
its
policies
on
guns
and
ammunition
following
high-profile
shootings
over
the
summer
one
of
which
occurred
at
its
stores
in
a
memo
circulated
to
employees
on
tuesday
walmart
ceo
doug
mcmillon
announced
that
the
company
would
no
longer
sell
handgun
ammunition
or
short-barrel
rifle
ammunition
like
and
nato
caliber
that
while
commonly
used
in
some
hunting
rifles
can
also
be
used
in
large
capacity
clips
on
military-style
weapons
now
the
arkansas-based
company
will
focus
on
long
barrel
hunting
rifles
and
their
corresponding
ammunition
the
ceo
added
we
have
a
long
heritage
as
a
company
of
serving
responsible
hunters
and
sportsmen
and
women
and
we're
going
to
continue
doing
so
mcmillon
said
we've
also
been
listening
to
a
lot
of
people
inside
and
outside
our
company
as
we
think
about
the
role
we
can
play
in
helping
to
make
the
country
safer
mcmillon
added
it's
clear
to
us
that
the
status
quo
is
unacceptable
in
addition
to
the
inventory
changes
the
company
will
also
ask
that
customers
no
longer
openly
carry
their
guns
in
its
stores
unless
they
are
members
of
law
enforcement
we
believe
the
opportunity
for
someone
to
misinterpret
a
situation
even
in
open
carry
states
could
lead
to
tragic
results
mcmillon
said
in
a
memo
distributed
to
employees
on
tuesday
we
hope
that
everyone
will
understand
the
circumstances
that
led
to
this
new
policy
and
will
respect
the
concerns
of
their
fellow
shoppers
and
our
associates
however
the
executive
explained
as
it
relates
to
concealed
carry
by
customers
with
permits
there
is
no
change
to
our
policy
or
approach
the
company
will
also
stop
selling
handguns
in
alaska
the
only
state
where
it
still
does
so
marking
our
complete
exit
from
handguns
walmart
has
previously
said
that
its
share
of
the
national
ammunition
sales
market
was
around
percent
tuesday's
memo
estimated
that
the
change
will
bring
the
company's
share
to
somewhere
between
and
percent
as
the
reason
for
the
changes
the
memo
cites
the
early
august
shooting
at
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
where
people
were
killed
as
well
as
another
incident
at
a
walmart
store
in
southaven
mississippi
where
authorities
say
one
employee
fatally
shot
two
co-workers
it
also
mentions
shootings
in
dayton
ohio
and
this
past
weekend's
attack
in
midland
and
odessa
texas
we
know
these
decisions
will
inconvenience
some
of
our
customers
and
we
hope
they
will
understand
mcmillon
wrote
as
a
company
we
experienced
two
horrific
events
in
one
week
and
we
will
never
be
the
same
walmart
has
made
decisions
to
scale
back
its
gun
and
ammunition
offerings
before
the
company
began
its
exit
from
the
handgun
business
in
and
stopped
selling
ar-style
modern
sporting
rifles
in
update
the
national
rifle
association
responded
to
the
news
of
walmart's
policy
changes
hours
later
saying
it
was
shameful
to
see
walmart
succumb
to
the
pressure
of
the
anti-gun
elites
the
truth
is
walmart's
actions
today
will
not
make
us
any
safer
the
statement
continued
rather
than
place
the
blame
on
the
criminal
walmart
has
chosen
to
victimize
law-abiding
americans
