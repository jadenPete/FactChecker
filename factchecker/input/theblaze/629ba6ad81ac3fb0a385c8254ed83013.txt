atheist
group
cries
foul
after
student-athletes
baptized
on
hs
football
field
but
school
district
is
fighting
back
serious
allegations
of
constitutional
misconduct
after
two
student-athletes
were
baptized
on
a
tennessee
public
high
school
football
field
last
month
a
concerned
area
resident
got
in
touch
with
the
freedom
from
religion
foundation
a
national
atheist
activist
group
which
in
turn
fired
off
a
letter
last
week
demanding
the
district
stop
promoting
and
endorsing
religion
to
students
the
tennessean
reported
but
the
paper
said
robertson
county
schools
is
fighting
back
regarding
the
aug
post-football
practice
ceremony
the
district
said
in
a
statement
that
neither
springfield
high
school
nor
school
personnel
violated
any
policies
or
laws
the
tennessean
said
specifically
the
activities
were
student
initiated
student
led
and
occurred
after
the
practice
session
had
ended
and
after
school
hours
the
statement
added
according
to
the
paper
all
participation
was
voluntary
with
no
requirement
for
attendance
either
stated
or
implied
what
else
the
ffrf's
letter
addressed
to
robertson
county
director
of
schools
chris
causey
noted
that
the
high
school
team's
character
coach
chad
diehl
performed
the
baptisms
diehl
also
a
minister
at
bethlehem
baptist
church
made
no
secret
of
his
involvement
but
while
the
ffrf's
letter
said
it's
illegal
for
coaches
to
organize
or
participate
in
religious
activities
with
students
causey
told
the
tennessean
that
diehl
isn't
employed
by
the
district
they
have
those
kinds
of
individuals
at
public
universities
as
well
he
added
to
the
paper
still
the
freedom
from
religion
foundation's
staff
attorney
chris
line
called
the
ceremony
inappropriate
this
is
especially
problematic
in
the
context
of
athletics
given
the
coercive
pressure
players
feel
to
conform
to
coaches
expectations
so
as
not
to
disappoint
coaches
or
hurt
their
standing
on
the
team
line
wrote
in
a
news
release
from
the
organization
the
tennessean
noted
but
casey
pushed
back
noting
to
the
paper
that
the
district
officials
have
not
received
a
single
phone
call
from
anyone
asking
us
about
these
baptisms
zero
if
we
have
concerned
parents
or
community
members
i
would
think
they
would
need
to
contact
the
district
office
about
it
instead
of
turning
to
organizations
that
aren't
even
based
in
tennessee
now
what
line
said
if
the
district
takes
no
action
there
could
be
legal
consequences
these
are
serious
allegations
of
constitutional
misconduct
he
told
the
tennessean
adding
that
any
parent
or
resident
can
take
action
against
the
school
district
if
we
have
a
parent
interested
in
pursuing
that
we
can
step
in
that's
a
definite
possibility
the
freedom
from
religion
foundation
earlier
this
year
claimed
a
video
showed
several
football
players
being
baptized
on
alabama
public
school
property
once
again
after
hearing
from
a
concerned
member
of
the
community
