eric
bolling
why
do
dems
refuse
to
condemn
the
hateful
anti-semitism
of
reps
tlaib
and
omar
eric
is
disgusted
by
the
rise
of
anti-semitism
in
the
democratic
party
on
thursday's
episode
of
america
with
eric
bolling
eric
called
out
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
and
ilhan
omar
d-minn
for
their
virulent
anti-semitic
grandstanding
and
issued
a
scathing
rebuke
to
leftists
for
refusing
to
condemn
their
hateful
rhetoric
eric
started
out
by
noting
how
the
liberal
media
and
politicians
have
robbed
the
word
racism
of
any
meaning
by
applying
it
to
anyone
who
disagrees
with
them
further
blurring
the
gray
line
between
what
is
racist
or
not
not
so
gray
however
is
line
of
anti-semitism
when
it
comes
to
two
u.s.
congresswomen
rashida
tlaib
and
ilhan
omar
eric
said
these
two
have
pole-vaulted
over
the
gray
line
of
anti-semitic
or
not
aside
from
a
history
of
anti-jewish
remarks
over
the
years
these
two
took
to
the
podium
this
past
week
demanding
entry
into
israel
to
support
bds
which
is
the
radical
group
trying
to
get
the
world
to
divest
from
israel
in
other
words
to
tank
the
israeli
economy
eric
said
that
democrat
representatives
invited
tlaib
and
omar
to
join
them
on
a
fact-finding
mission
to
israel
just
a
week
or
so
prior
and
both
congresswomen
refused
hmm
gotta
wonder
why
he
said
of
their
declining
this
first
opportunity
to
visit
israel
maybe
so
they
could
pull
another
stunt
by
feigning
outrage
and
therefore
getting
some
more
airtime
and
guess
what
it's
president
donald
trump's
fault
that's
what
they
said
tlaib
and
omar
are
nothing
but
fame-hustlers
buying
the
spotlight
by
oddly
defending
known
terrorist
sponsors
palestine
and
iran
over
america's
most
important
middle
eastern
ally
israel
