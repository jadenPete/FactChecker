college
board
the
company
that
manages
the
sat
exam
has
announced
that
it
will
be
scrapping
its
controversial
adversity
score
just
a
few
months
after
it
was
first
announced
what's
the
background
in
may
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
college
board
would
be
adding
an
adversity
score
to
its
sats
while
the
exams
themselves
would
judge
academic
proficiency
they
would
be
attached
to
an
anonymized
adversity
score
that
factored
in
things
like
poverty
level
and
the
crime
rate
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
student
went
to
school
the
college
board
hoped
that
by
including
this
score
they
could
make
the
test
more
fair
to
disadvantaged
students
there
are
a
number
of
amazing
students
who
may
have
scored
less
but
have
accomplished
more
college
board
president
david
coleman
told
the
wall
street
journal
at
the
time
we
can't
sit
on
our
hands
and
ignore
the
disparities
of
wealth
reflected
in
the
sat
what
happened
now
the
idea
of
a
single
score
was
confusing
because
it
seemed
that
all
of
a
sudden
the
college
board
was
trying
to
score
adversity
that's
not
the
college
board's
mission
coleman
told
npr
on
tuesday
the
college
board
scores
achievement
not
adversity
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
on
wednesday
coleman
said
that
his
company
decided
that
people
were
right
when
they
said
that
you
should
not
be
scoring
this
he
said
that
people
were
comfortable
with
the
college
board
giving
general
consistent
information
so
that
no
matter
where
you
live
or
learn
you
get
an
equal
look
and
that's
fair
and
that's
a
good
role
for
us
to
play
instead
of
the
adversity
score
the
college
board
created
landscape
a
method
of
providing
colleges
with
information
about
high
schools
without
using
a
per-student
scoring
system
these
school
ratings
would
be
publicly
available
