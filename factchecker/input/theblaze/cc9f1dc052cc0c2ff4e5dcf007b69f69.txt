are
not
enough
eric
trump
says
he
will
sue
msnbc
over
lawrence
o'donnell
report
the
network
might
face
some
consequences
for
fake
news
eric
trump
said
wednesday
that
his
company
would
sue
over
a
supposed
bombshell
reported
by
lawrence
o'donnell
on
his
msnbc
show
on
tuesday
evening
this
was
a
reckless
attempt
to
slander
our
family
and
smear
a
great
company
trump
tweeted
apologies
are
not
enough
when
the
true
intent
was
solely
to
damage
and
cause
harm
as
a
company
we
will
be
taking
legal
action
this
unethical
behavior
has
to
stop
he
added
he
was
referring
to
the
apology
o'donnell
issued
after
the
report
last
night
i
made
an
error
in
judgment
by
reporting
an
item
about
the
president's
finances
that
didn't
go
through
our
rigorous
verification
and
standards
process
o'donnell
tweeted
i
shouldn't
have
reported
it
and
i
was
wrong
to
discuss
it
on
the
air
he
added
i
will
address
the
issue
on
my
show
tonight
what
did
o'donnell
say
o'donnell
had
reported
that
one
source
had
confirmed
from
the
president's
taxes
that
he
had
received
business
funding
through
guarantees
from
russian
oligarchs
journalists
generally
do
not
report
claims
based
on
only
one
source
this
single
source
close
to
deutsche
bank
has
told
me
that
donald
trump's
loan
documents
there
show
that
he
has
co-signers
that's
how
he
was
able
to
obtain
those
loans
and
that
the
co-signers
are
russian
oligarchs
o'donnell
told
rachel
maddow
as
she
transitioned
her
show
to
his
if
true
that
would
explain
every
kind
word
donald
trump
has
ever
said
about
russia
and
vladimir
putin
if
true
o'donnell
continued
on
his
own
show
the
apology
for
the
story
came
after
a
lawyer
for
president
trump
demanded
that
msnbc
detract
their
report
calling
it
false
and
defamatory
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
also
excoriated
msnbc
over
the
poorly
source
report
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
a
majority
of
americans
have
lost
trust
in
the
media
grisham
said
instead
of
applying
ethics
and
standards
to
their
reporting
journalists
and
left-wing
outlets
have
weaponized
the
media
using
it
to
attack
and
harass
people
with
little
to
no
regard
for
the
truth
she
concluded
deutsche
bank
who
was
cited
as
the
source
of
the
tax
returns
with
the
supposed
evidence
declined
to
comment
on
the
allegations
here's
more
about
the
msnbc
mistake
the
five
react
to
msnbc
host
backpedaling
on
trump
story
