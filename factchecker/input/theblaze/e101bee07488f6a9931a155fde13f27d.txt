if
you
challenge
darwinism
you
challenge
everything
about
progressivism
leftists
darwin
religion
is
more
important
to
them
than
science
greetings
from
the
world
of
science
that
will
be
promptly
ignored
or
attacked
by
progressives
due
to
lacking
in
sufficient
woke
magic
a
professor
from
no
less
than
yale
university
has
stuck
a
fork
in
one
of
the
leftist
intellectual
establishment's
primary
cornerstones
basically
david
gelernter
says
darwinism
is
for
suckers
then
he
added
that
not
only
is
darwinism
insufficient
and
outdated
science
but
it
has
also
reached
the
point
of
unstable
religiosity
among
his
peers
and
as
if
the
computer
science
wizard
didn't
have
enough
of
a
death
wish
he
went
even
further
and
said
that
intelligent
design
one
of
academia's
favorite
whipping
boys
over
the
course
of
the
last
decade-plus
is
an
argument
that
must
be
taken
seriously
and
is
not
simply
the
product
of
religious
imagination
dude
there's
laying
down
ordinance
and
then
there's
this
guy
he
could
make
thanos
blush
with
a
snap
of
the
fingers
like
this
but
the
fossil
record
simply
doesn't
support
darwin
gelernter
noted
furthermore
the
likelihood
of
randomly
occurring
proteins
of
the
sort
and
volume
required
to
produce
abundant
and
variant
life
of
our
complex
sort
like
we
have
is
statistically
impossible
it
is
what
it
is
that's
science
for
you
just
the
facts
except
gelernter
knows
for
many
of
the
scientists
you
take
your
life
into
your
hands
to
challenge
darwinism
intellectually
he
said
they
will
destroy
you
because
when
you
challenge
darwinism
you
are
actually
challenging
literally
everything
that
progressivism
has
to
offer
its
cosmology
its
epistemology
its
ethics
everything
for
progressivism
is
really
a
spirit
of
the
age
cult
and
nothing
will
stand
in
a
cult's
way
not
even
your
science
facts
and
stuff
yet
here's
the
thing
about
cults
they
always
end
up
on
the
ash
heap
of
history
and
always
for
the
same
reasons
see
you
can
only
tilt
at
windmills
or
shake
your
first
at
god
for
so
long
eventually
if
you
break
the
natural
law
long
enough
it
ends
up
breaking
you
sooner
or
later
you're
gonna
learn
the
hard
way
that
reality
bites
dude
it's
just
a
matter
of
how
much
collateral
damage
you
cause
and
how
many
poor
souls
you
cause
to
perish
on
the
way
to
your
eternal
comeuppance
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
they
will
declare
it
no
matter
how
many
institutions
you
co-opt
and
coerce
no
matter
how
many
cultures
you
ruin
no
matter
how
many
lies
you
tell
no
matter
how
much
magical
thinking
you
believe
no
matter
how
much
you
intimidate
critical-thinkers
into
silence
no
matter
how
thoroughly
you
thought-police
faculty
boards
newsrooms
and
social
media
platforms
for
no
matter
how
much
temporal
power
your
cult
thinks
it
has
or
people
it's
confident
it
has
deceived
these
words
from
captain
america
perfectly
describe
what
the
real
chain
of
command
is
around
here
there's
only
one
god
and
i'm
pretty
sure
he
doesn't
dress
like
that
