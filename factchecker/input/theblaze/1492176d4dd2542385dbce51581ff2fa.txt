and

was
confronted
about

affair
by
a
reporter
from
wcco-tv
the
minneapolis
cbs
affiliate
in
omar's
district
are
you
separated
from
your

somebody
reporter
esme
murphy
asked
no
i
am
not
omar
responded
and
like
i
said
yesterday
i
have
no
interest
in
allowing
the
conversation
about
my
personal
life
to
continue
and
so
i
have
no
desire
to
discuss
it
whether
or
not
a
politician's
personal
life
should
be
discussed
in
public
they
are
public
officials
after
all
there
are
legal
concerns
surrounding
omar's
alleged
relationship
specifically
related
to
the
money
that
her
campaign
spent
on
services
from
mynett's
consulting
firm
the
e
street
group
as
the
washington
examiner
noted
nearly
one
of
every
three
dollars
spent
on
ilhan
omar's
campaign
has
gone
to
her
alleged
lover's
firm
the
examiner
explained
of
the
reported
earnings
by
the
e
street
group
during
the
campaign
cycle
came
from
omar's
campaign
not
counting
payroll
taxes
and
transfers
to
minnesota's
democratic
party
e
street
group
was
omar's
second-largest
vendor
according
to
fec
data
from
labor
day
through
the
end
of
the
year
e
street
group
ate
up
more
than
of
her
campaign's
spending
not
counting
transfers
to
other
campaigns
here's
the
odd
thing
the
overwhelming
majority
of
omar's
funds
spent
on
the
e
street
group
were
paid
after
she
won
the
contested
primary
and
during
the
totally
noncompetitive
general
election
race
in
her
d
district
contrary
to
fec
rules
omar's
filings
did
not
designate
whether
her
e
street
group
disbursements
or
any
of
her
disbursements
were
for
the
primary
election
or
the
general
election
the
omar
campaign
payments
to
the
e
street
group
often
reported
as
fundraising
consulting
fees
on
her
fec
filings
have
accelerated
in
the
cycle
her
campaign
has
spent
at
e
street
this
year
the
campaign
off
year
that's
nearly
one
in
every
three
dollars
spent
on
her
reelection
again
not
including
transfers
to
other
campaigns
or
committees
going
to
her
alleged
lover
a
conservative
watchdog
group
national
legal
and
policy
center
has
already
filed
a
complaint
with
the
federal
election
commission
because
many
of
the
payments
omar's
campaign
made
to
e
street
group
for
things
like
travel
reimbursement
coincide
with
the
alleged
affair
using
campaign
funds
to
aid
an
affair
would
constitute
a
violation
of
fec
regulations
in
july
the
daily
mail
reported
that
omar
had
separated
from
her
husband
ahmed
hirsi
and
the
couple
were
headed
toward
their
second
divorce
