the

and
more
said
that
the
book
began
as
a
personal
venture
i
didn't
really
mean
it
to
be
public
grylls
said
i
wrote
this
book
because
i
try
to
do
something
every
day
at
the
start
of
the
day
and
i've
just
written
down
notes
over
the
years
of
things
that
have
helped
me
where
i
secretly
find
my
strength
it's
rooted
in
christ's
teaching
but
it's
all
about
love
he
explained
the
book
titled
soul
fuel
is
a
day
devotional
an
audiobook
of
the
feature
is
also
available
in
the
book
according
to
the
network
grylls
writes
i
often
don't
feel
very
strong
life
can
be
a
battle
we
all
feel
that
from
time
to
time
but
any
strength
i
do
have
seems
to
come
in
the
quiet
moments
at
the
start
of
my
day
it
comes
when
i
am
on
my
own
on
my
knees
it
comes
from
taking
time
to
be
still
with
god
so
the
book
continues
for
me
starting
my
day
like
this
really
helps
it
is
like
food
like
good
fuel
for
the
soul
another
excerpt
from
grylls
book
reads
what
else
according
to
faithwire
grylls
said
that
the
message
of
faith
is
life's
most
important
you
know
i've
never
met
a
strong
person
who
hasn't
had
a
hard
road
he
said
and
there
is
an
element
i
think
of
faith
when
we're
put
under
fire
or
we're
scared
or
we're
grieving
or
we're
facing
some
illness
or
whatever
and
in
a
way
those
are
the
times
when
the
fluff
gets
blown
away
and
the
religious
stuff
gets
blown
away
and
the
really
important
stuff
which
is
i'm
beside
you
i
will
help
you
i
will
hold
you
which
is
what
the
message
of
faith
is
he
told
parade
that
his
view
on
faith
at
large
can
be
summed
up
in
trusting
the
lord
i
hold
onto
the
time
when
jesus
said
he
had
come
to
abolish
religion
but
bring
life
he
said
religion
is
a
set
of
rules
that
confines
but
christ
was
all
about
being
set
free
and
empowered
faith
to
me
is
well
summed
up
in
the
phrase
facing
all
i
trust
him
faith
