attorney
nisha
kashyap
from
pro
bono
law
firm
public
counsel
is
representing
morrissey
she
told
the
times
this
city
tows
otherwise
safely
parked
cars
after
hours
but
then
refuses
to
consider
evidence
submitted
to
contest
citations
and
impound
this
not
only
disproportionately
impacts
low-income
residents
but
it's
also
ableist
these
practices
discriminate
against
people
like
mr
morrissey
whose
medical
conditions
restrict
their
ability
to
move
a
car
and
are
counterproductive
for
angelenos
already
struggling
to
get
by
when
asked
about
mr
morrissey's
case
a
spokesman
for
the
city
of
los
angeles
attorney's
office
said
we'll
review
the
claim
and
we
have
no
further
comment
at
this
time
