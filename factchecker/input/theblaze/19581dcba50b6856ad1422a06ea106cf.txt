when
green
energy
isn't
so
green
retiring
worn-out
wind
turbines
is
a
wasteful
process
those
spinning
blades
on
the
horizon
aren't
as
green
as
you
may
think
wind
energy
has
a
big
waste
problem
a
story
from
harvest
public
media
delved
into
what
happens
when
those
big
turbines
that
dot
horizons
all
over
the
united
states
reach
the
end
of
their
usefulness
and
have
to
be
scrapped
as
it
turns
out
most
of
the
wind
turbine's
structure
can
be
sold
or
recycled
but
the
blades
which
are
made
of
a
mix
of
fiberglass
and
resin
cannot
these
towers
may
be
supporting
as
much
as
pounds
feet
in
the
air
rob

who
is
in
the
process
of
scrapping
a
wind
farm
in
kimball
nebraska
the
stands
are
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
steel
so
they're
very
strong
but
van
vleet
add
the
blades
are
kind
of
a
dud
because
they
have
no
value
to
make
things
worse
the
united
states
will
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
an
estimated
tons
of
blade
material
over
the
next
two
decades
according
to
the
report
and
how
are
the
blades
disposed
of
the
answer
is
cumbersome
and
costly
because
the
parts
are
hundreds
of
feet
long
they
have
to
be
cut
up
on
site
and
then
hauled
away
on
special
equipment
just
to
get
them
to
a
landfill
and
the
difficulties
continue
after
the
blade
parts
are
on
the
trucks
if
you're
a
small
utility
or
municipality
and
all
of
a
sudden
hundreds
of
blades
start
coming
to
your
landfill
you
don't
want
to
use
up
your
capacity
for
your
local
municipal
trash
for
wind
turbine
blades
van

explained
to
the
outlet
one
of
the
few
landfills
in
the
country
big
enough
to
accept
wind
farm
waste
is
in
casper
wyoming
the
hpm
story
says
initially
they
tried
to
crush
the
blades
but
realized
that
they
would
have
needed
to
upgrade
to
crushing
equipment
meant
for
mining
in
order
to
do
so
effectively
so
the
team
there
settled
on
cutting
the
blades
up
and
stuffing
the
pieces
inside
each
other
meanwhile
in
south
dakota
local
officials
have
had
to
clamp
down
on
their
local
dump
taking
in
blades
from
two
wind
farms
in
iowa
because
the
process
of
disposing
them
was
such
a
drain
on
resources
according
to
the
sioux
falls
argus-leader
we
can't
take
any
more
unless
they
process
them
before
bringing
them
to
us
sioux
falls
public
works
director
mark
cotter
told
the
paper
we're
using
too
many
resources
unloading
them
driving
over
them
a
couple
times
and
working
them
into
the
ground
this
isn't
just
an
american
problem
either
a
report
at
deutsche
welle
details
germany's
challenges
with
disposing
of
decommissioned
turbine
parts
the
european
country
had
about
turbines
at
the
time
over
of
those
turbines
are
old
and
will
have
to
be
decommissioned
by
the
waste
issue
just
adds
on
to
the
list
of
downsides
to
wind
energy
among
others
are
the
unreliability
of
the
power
source
hazards
to
wildlife
posed
by
the
rotating
blades
noise
pollution
and
their
aesthetic
effects
on

them
