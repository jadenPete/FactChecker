breaks
down
the
big
legal
issues
raised
by
the
controversial
new
york
times
report
on
the
supreme
court
justice
president
trump
suggested
this
week
that
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
sue
the
new
york
times
for
libel
after
they
published
a
report
on
alleged
sexual
misconduct
that
initially
omitted
key
information
that
undermined
the
claim
but
whether
this
would
be
a
good
idea
legally
is
up
for
debate
the
times
ignited
calls
from
democratic
presidential
candidates
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
after
publishing
the
report
over
the
weekend
then
late
sunday
the
paper
published
a
major
revision
noting
the
initial
version
did
not
reveal
that
friends
of
the
alleged
victim
said
she
did
not
recall
the
episode
that
omission
could
be
enough
for
a
libel
suit
according
to
one
legal
analyst
however
such
a
lawsuit
also
could
open
the
door
to
more
testimony
from
defense
witnesses
and
would
place
the
burden
on
him
to
prove
the
story
was
false
essentially
meaning
he
would
have
to
prove
his
innocence

fox
news
senior
judicial
analyst
judge
andrew
napolitano
told
fox
friends
tuesday
morning
that's
going
to
open
up
a
pandora's
box
for
him
that
being
said
kavanaugh
could
still
have
a
chance
to
win
if
he
did
sue
in
order
to
prove
a
libel
case
he
would
have
to
show
that
the
times
story
was
false
damaging
and
because
he
is
a
public
figure
meets
the
higher
standard
of
actual
malice
meaning
they
either
knew
it
was
false
or
displayed
a
reckless
disregard
for
whether
it
was
true
while
that
normally
is
a
difficult
hurdle
to
overcome
napolitano
said
the
times
actions
could
be
enough

accuses

this
alleged

actually

napolitano
said
attorney
robert
barnes
who
is
representing
students
from
covington
catholic
high
school
in
a
defamation
case
against
lawmakers
and
journalists
had
a
similar
assessment
of
a
hypothetical
kavanaugh
lawsuit
yes
he
would
have
a
case
against
the
times
due
to
their
knowing
exclusion
of
a
particularly
pertinent
contextual
exculpatory
fact
barnes
told
fox
news
that
said
it
is
rarely
a
good
idea
for
a
supreme
court
justice
to
sue
over
this
kind
of
matter
ucla
law
professor
eugene
volokh
was
less
optimistic
about
kavanaugh's
chances
against
the
times
telling
law
crime
com
that
the
case
would
be
a
loser
because
he
does
not

volokh
also
told
the
outlet
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
for
kavanaugh
to
keep
the
media's
attention
on
this
this

volokh
said
cornell
law
professor
michael
dorf
agreed
saying
kavanaugh
would
likely
want
the
story
out
of
the
news
he
also
said
such
a
case
would
almost
certainly
be
unwise
since
it
would
give
the
times
the
opportunity
to
seek
discovery
materials
that
they
could
try
to
use
against
kavanaugh
for
the
time
being
though
the
story
remains
in
the
headlines
as
some
democrats
try
to
pressure
congressional
leaders
to
launch
impeachment
proceedings
against
him
senate
republican
leaders
in
turn
have
vowed
to
defend
kavanaugh
from
such
efforts
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
took
to
the
senate
floor
monday
afternoon
to
decry
what
he
described
as
a
