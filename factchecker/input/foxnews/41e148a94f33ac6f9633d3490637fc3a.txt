after
some
pressure
from
the
tonight
show's
audience
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
expressed
her
support
for
a
mandatory
buyback
program
for
assault
weapons
on
monday
during
her
appearance
on
the
tonight
show
starring
jimmy
fallon
towards
the
end
of
her
interview
she
took
questions
from
the
audience
made
up
of
mostly
college
students
one
of
them
had
pressed
harris
about
her
stance
on
guns
do
you
believe
in
the
mandatory
buyback
of
quote-unquote
assault
weapons
and
whether
or
not
you
do
how
does
that
idea
not
go
against
fundamentally
the
second
amendment
andrew
from
fordham
university
asked
cnn
pundit
rips
beto
o'rourke's
vow
to
seize
guns
it
significantly
increases
the
chances
of
trump's
reelection
great
question
i
do
believe
that
we
need
to
do
buybacks
and
i'll
tell
you
why
harris
responded
first
of
all
let's
be
clear
about
what
assault
weapons
are
they
have
been
designed
to
kill
a
lot
of
human
beings
quickly
they
are
weapons
of
war
with
no
place
on
the
streets
of
a
civil
society
i've
seen
assault
weapons
kill
babies
and
police
officers
the
hopeful
then
reiterated
her
threat
of
executive
order
as
president
if
congress
doesn't
act
on
gun
reform
but
stressed
that
the
over
million
assault
weapons
currently
in
the
streets
need
to
be
addressed
a
buyback
program
is
a
good
idea
now
we
need
to
do
it
the
right
way
harris
continued
and
part
of
that
has
to
be
you
know
buy
back
and
give
people
their
value
the
financial
value
of
what
they
have
and
not
just
take
things
from
people
that
have
value
without
compensating
them
we
need
to
do
it
the
right
way
