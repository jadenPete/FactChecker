a

the
former

official
facing
the
possibility
of
federal
charges
is
making
a
fresh
attempt
to
pressure

to
drop
the
case
against
him
citing
supposed
rumors
that
a
grand

has
already
declined
to
indict
him
grand
jury
proceedings
are
highly
secretive
and
the
status
of
mccabe's
case
remains
unclear
speculation
was
widespread
earlier
thursday
that
he
could
soon
be
facing
prosecution
as
u.s.
attorney
jessie
liu
recommended
moving
forward
with
charges
and
the
doj
rejected
a
last-ditch
appeal
from
mccabe
but
in
an
unusual
email
sent
thursday
night
and
obtained
by
fox
news
mccabe's
legal
team
sought
to
pressure
the
justice
department
to
show
its
cards
citing
rumors
from
reporters
starting
this
morning
that
the
grand
jury
considering
charges
against
mr
mccabe
had
declined
to
vote
an
indictment
us
attorney
recommends
proceeding
with
charges
against
mccabe
as
doj
rejects
last-ditch
appeal
attorney
michael
bromwich
said
if
this
is
the
case
the
only
fair
and
just
result
is
for
you
to
accept
the
grand
jury's
decision
and
end
these
proceedings
they
urged
the
doj
not
to
resubmit
the
case
if
the
evidence
presented
by
your
office
was
insufficient
to
convince
members
of
the
grand
jury
to
find
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr
mccabe
had
committed
any
crimes
in
another
email
bromwich
wrote
please
confirm
that
if
this
in
fact
occurred
you
would

last

a

it
is
rare
for
a

by

bromwich
cited
two
news

suggesting
that

we
do

they
were
credible
