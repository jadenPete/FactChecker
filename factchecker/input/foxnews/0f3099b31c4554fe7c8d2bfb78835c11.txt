who
didn't
qualify
for
thursday
night's
presidential
primary
debate
says
the
democratic
national
committee's
qualification
system
could
be
sowing
distrust
among
voters
gabbard
also
called
the
debates
kind
of
a
charade
for
their
lack
of
substance
tulsi
gabbard
says
trump
impeachment
would
tear
country
apart
what's
clear
is
that
this
system
lacks
transparency
gabbard
told
dave
rubin
on
the
rubin
report
adding
that
this
is
problematic
because
it
creates
a
lack
of
trust
in
democratic
voters
that
the
dnc
is
actually
working
for
their
interest
gabbard
has
called
out
the
dnc
for
its
debate
qualification
standards
before
candidates
must
meet
donation
requirements
as
well
as
receive
support
from
at
least
percent
of
participants
in
four
polls
recognized
by
the
committee
gabbard
accused
the
dnc
of
being
unfair
in
deciding
which
polls
qualify
and
blamed
this
for
her
exclusion
from
thursday's
event
in
houston
she
voiced
concern
that
the
dnc's
lack
of
transparency
when
it
comes
to
how
they
determine
the
qualification
system
could
discourage
voters
from
even
taking
part
in
primary
races
knives

as
dems
gather
for
third
debate
when
you've
got
lack
of
trust
then
you've
got
people
who
wonder
whether
they
should
even
be
involved
at
all
whether
or
not
they
should
show
up
to
the
caucuses
and
the
primaries
if
the
fix
is
already
in
gabbard
also
lamented
the
nature
of
the
debates
and
the
focus
on
which
candidates
come
up
with
entertaining
quips
rather
than
on
in-depth
discussions
of
issues
that
could
be
informative
for
viewers

these
debates
end
up
being
kind
of
a
charade
about
providing
a
transparent
process
for
voters
to
become
educated
but
none
of
that's
actually
happening
she
said
gabbard
appears
to
be
having
better
luck
in
potentially
qualifying
for
october's
debate
she
has
already
met
the
donor
requirement
and
has
met
the
necessary
threshold
in
two
out
of
four
polls
so
far
