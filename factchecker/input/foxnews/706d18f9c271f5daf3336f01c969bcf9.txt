snowden's
memoir
tells
his
life
story
in
detail
for
the
first
time
explaining
why
he
chose
to
risk
his
freedom
to
become
perhaps
the
most
famous
whistleblower
of
all
time
snowden
writes
in
the
book
that
his
seven
years
working
for
the
nsa
and
cia
led
him
to
conclude
the
u.s.
intelligence
community
hacked
the
constitution
and
put
everyone's
liberty
at
risk
and
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
turn
to
journalists
to
reveal
it
to
the
world
i
realized
that
i
was
crazy
to
have
imagined
that
the
supreme
court
or
congress
or
president
obama
seeking
to
distance
his
administration
from
president
george
w.
bush's
would
ever
hold
the
ic
intelligence
community
legally
responsible
for
anything
he
writes
his
decision
to
turn
from
obscure
ic
wonk
to
whistleblower
in
set
off
a
national
debate
about
the
extent
of
government
surveillance
by
intelligence
agencies
desperate
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
the
sept
attacks
intelligence
officials
who
conduct
annual
classified
assessments
of
damage
from
snowden's
disclosures
say
the
documents
will
continue
trickling
out
into
the
public
domain
for
years
to
come
amid
the
release
of
his
book
snowden
this
week
called
on
french
president
emmanuel
macron

in
an
interview
monday
on

this

snowden
said
he
would
like
to
return
to
the
united
states
one
day
if
he
can
get
a
fair
jury
trial
that
is
the
ultimate
goal
but
if
i'm
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
prison
then
my
one
bottom-line
demand
that
we
all
have
to
agree
to
is
that
at
least
i
get
a
fair
trial
