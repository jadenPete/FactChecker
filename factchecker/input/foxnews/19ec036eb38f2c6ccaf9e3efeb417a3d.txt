the
house
on
thursday
voted
to
reinstate
a
decades-long
ban
on
oil
and
gas
drilling
in
alaska's
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
in
a
move
meant
to
stymie
president
trump's
plan
to
open
up
the
wilderness
to
commercial
interests
the
move
by
the
democrat-controlled
lower
chamber
of
congress
is
largely
symbolic
as
the
senate
which
is
still
in
the
hands
of
republicans
is
unlikely
to
take
action
on
the
bill
and
even
if
it
did
trump
has
vowed
to
veto
any
legislation
that
would
prevent
oil
and
gas
drilling
in
anwr
the
drilling
was
authorized
under
a
tax
cut

by
the
republican-controlled
congress

jared
huffman
of
california
said
there
are
some
places
too
wild
too
important
too
special
to
be
spoiled
by
oil
and
gas
development
native
alaskans
divided
over
oil
drilling
in
pristine
arctic
refuge
and
its
potential
riches
but
republicans
including
all
three
members
of
alaska's
congressional
delegation
said
drilling
can
be
done
safely
with
modern
techniques
and
would
decrease
u.s.
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
create
jobs
for
alaskans
rep
don
young
r-alaska
said
huffman
certainly
takes
a
great
interest
in
how
we
alaskans
operate
i
would
suggest
he
pay
more
attention
to
the
issues

his
own

this

let
me
say
again
the
area
set
aside
for

is
designated
for
development
while
widely
opposed

many
democrats

environmental
groups
drilling

enjoys
broad
support
from
alaskans

one

side

alaska's

its

a

that

the

boon
to

society's
alaska
regional
director
told
fox
news
it
is
not
a
place
where
oil
and
gas
development
should
be
allowed
the
refuge
was
created
in
as
part
of
comprehensive
public-lands
legislation
signed
into
law
by
president
jimmy
carter
that
put
more
than
million
federal
acres
in
alaska
under
conservation
protection
lawmakers
at
the
time
recognized
the
potential
for
oil
drilling
on
the
coastal
plain
but
they
prohibited
leasing
or
other
development
on
the
land
unless
authorized
by
a
future
congress
in
the
alaskan
delegation
inserted
a
provision
opening
anwr
to
development
in
a
budget
reconciliation
bill
but
the
bill
was
vetoed
by
president
bill
clinton
in
despite
having
the
senate
house
and
white
house
all
in
republican
hands
a
push
to
open
anwr
was
also
unsuccessful
as
a
number
of
moderate
republicans
voted
against
it
huffman
and
other
supporters
of
the
house
bill
note
that
the
refuge
is
home
to
more
than
different
wildlife
species
including
bird
species
that
migrate
to
states
and
districts
across
the
country
you
don't
have
to
have
visited

the
vote
on
alaska
drilling
comes
after
the
house
approved
two
bills
wednesday
that
would
permanently
bar
drilling
off
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
and
extend
a
moratorium
on
drilling
off
florida's
west
coast
coastal
lawmakers
from
both
parties
said
the
bills
would
protect
u.s.
coasts
from
drilling
that
can
pollute
crucial
waters
and
lead
to
disasters

as
