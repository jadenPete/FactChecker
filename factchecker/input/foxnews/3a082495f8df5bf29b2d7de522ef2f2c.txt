conservatives
once
more
have
rallied
around
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
as
he
faces
a
new
round
of
disputed
sexual
misconduct
allegations
but
gop
lawmakers
claim
the
calls
from
democratic
presidential
candidates
for
his
impeachment
speak
to
a
bigger
issue
as
part
of
their
defense
of
kavanaugh
they
say
the
renewed
campaign
against
president
trump's
second
supreme
court
pick
is
part
of
an
escalating
series
of
attacks
on
judicial
independence

recent
warnings
to
the
high

and
calls
for
court-packing

the
pressure

after
demanding

this
is
not

political
behavior
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
said
earlier
this
week
on
the
senate
floor
the
calls
for
kavanaugh's
ouster
followed
a
new
york
times
report
on
sexual
misconduct
allegations
but
the
report
was
called
into
question
after
the
newspaper
revised
its
original
story
to
note
the
apparent
victim
in
the
newly
alleged
incident
did
not
recall
it
it's
an
attack
on
judicial
independence
said
carrie
severino
chief
counsel
and
policy
director
for
the
conservative
judicial
crisis
network
in
response
to
the
kavanaugh
controversy
they're
trying
to
intimidate
to
bully
and
to
threaten
the
justices
because
they're
hoping
that
they'll
help
advance
and
protect
this
liberal
agenda
that
they're
trying
to
get
through
the
courts
when
they
know
it's
being
rejected
by
the
american
people
kavanaugh's
most
vocal
critics
though
say
the
latest
allegation
that
he
had
his
pants
down
at
a
dorm
party
where
friends
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
is
one
of
several
that
merit
deeper
investigation
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
a
presidential
candidate
tweeted
the
reality
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
is
that
it
lacked
any
integrity
there
has
never
been
a
meaningful
investigation
into
these
allegations
we
need
the
truth
while
top
democratic
leaders
have
pushed
back
on
the
impeachment
calls
and
suggested
it's
not
part
of
their
agenda
right
now
the
campaign
against
kavanaugh
is
not
over
liberal
activist
organizations
demand
justice
the
center
for
popular
democracy
and
the
women's
march
are
planning
protests
on
oct
the
anniversary
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
my
republican
colleagues
and
i
will
fight
to
preserve
a
fair
and
independent
judiciary
mcconnell
tweeted
mcconnell
is
often
vilified
by
democrats
for
his
own
tactics
regarding
the
judiciary
namely
his
role
in
preventing
then-president
barack
obama's
final
nominee
merrick
garland
from
being
considered
in
the
senate
garland's
nomination
never
received
a
hearing
or
a
confirmation
vote
so
when
the
seat
left
vacant
by
the
death
of
justice
antonin
scalia
was
still
open
after
president
trump
took
office
trump
was
able
to
name
neil
gorsuch
instead
mcconnell
claimed
it
was
appropriate
not
to
act
on
garland's
nomination
because
he
believed
the
outgoing
president
should
not
get
to
select
a
supreme
court
justice
during
his
final
year
in
office
democrats
were
livid
earlier
this
year
when
mcconnell
said
if
the
same
situation
came
up
during
the
final
year
of
trump's
term
he
would
confirm
the
nominee
mcconnell's
communication
director
later
said
that
the
difference
is
that
presently
the
white
house
and
senate
are
controlled
by
the
same
party
which
was
not
the
case
with
obama
mcconnell
however
is
not
the
only
one
blasting
democrats
for
recent
actions
on
tuesday
sen

blackburn
r-tenn
accused
democrats
and
the
media
of
leveraging
unfounded
criminal
allegations
against
a
duly
confirmed
supreme
court
justice
in
an
effort
to
undermine
not
only
his
work
but
ultimately
the
entire
court
as
an
institution
just
last
month
democratic
senators
led
by
rhode
island's
sheldon
whitehouse
filed
a
brief
accusing
the
supreme
court
of
being
not
well
and
essentially
threatened
that
if
the
justices
don't
heal
themselves
they
could
be
restructured
which
was
believed
to
be
a
reference
to
court-packing
several
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
supported
this
concept
of
expanding
the
roster
of
the
supreme
court
increasing
the
number
of
justices
would
allow
the
president
to

senate

took
the
democrats
to
task
for
the
restructuring
threat
saying
that
expanding
the
supreme
court
to
make
it
more
liberal
has
long
been

do
everything
in

to
the

warning
the
justices
not
to
give

the

journal
editorial
board
wrote
that
whitehouse's
brief
and
the
current
calls
for
impeaching
kavanaugh
are
part
of
an
assault
on
the
judiciary
inspired
in
part
by
an
agenda
including
the
green
new
deal
which
could
ultimately
rely
on
court
rulings
members
of
the
court
have
largely
remained
silent
on
these
issues
although
liberal
stalwart
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
spoke
out
against
expanding
the
court
in
