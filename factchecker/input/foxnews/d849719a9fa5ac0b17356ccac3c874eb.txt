safety
legislation
has
been
complicated
by
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke's
confiscation
rhetoric
the
former
texas
congressman
has
fueled
the
fears
of
gun-rights
groups
by
openly
saying
at
last
week's
debate
what
democrats
have
long
denied
hell
yes

white
house
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
told
fox
news
tuesday
that
he
expected
an
announcement
very
soon
gidley
said
trump
wanted
to
make
sure
that
any
new
laws
would
address
actual
problems
and
not
just
be
feel-good
legislation
the
president's
morning
tweet
may
be
an
indication
that
such
an
announcement
could
be
delayed
o'rourke
even
took
heat
from
his
own
party
for
the
remarks

one
of

opponents
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
agreed
that
o'rourke's
statement
was
counterproductive
given
that
republicans
are
currently
at
least
discussing
gun
safety
when
even
this
president
and
even
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
are
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hand
he
told
cnn
let's
make
the
most
of
it
and
get
these
things
done
o'rourke
hit
back
tweeting
leaving
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
because
trump
and
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
that
calculation
and
fear
is
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
let's
have
the
courage
to
say
what
we
believe
and
fight
for
it
