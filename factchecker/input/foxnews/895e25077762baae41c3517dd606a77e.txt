the
democratic
agenda
is
putting
the
party
in
jeopardy
for
ari
fleischer
democrat
debates
have
been
a
display
of
losing
ideasafter
the
second
round
of
democrat
primary
debates
former
white
house
press
secretary
and
fox
news
contributor
ari
fleischer
lays
out
the
three
big
ideas
he
believes
will
push
voters
away
from
the
democrat
party
in
a
liberal
democratic
agenda
is
putting
the
party
in
danger
of
losing
the
presidential
election
former
white
house
press
secretary
ari
fleischer
said
friday
appearing
on
america's
newsroom
with
anchor
bill
hemmer
fleischer
noted
that
of
the
top
three
democrats
leading
in
the
polls
including
former
two-term
vice
president
joe
biden
massachusetts
senator
elizabeth
warren
and
independent
vermont
senator
bernie
sanders
two
of
them
are
socialists
and
if
elizabeth
warren
or
bernie
sanders
are
the
nominees
for
the
democrats
which
you
add
them
up
right
now
those
two
socialists
are
beating
joe
biden
if
one
of
them
becomes
the
nominee
the
democrats
have
moved
so
far
to
the
left
in
a
direction
way
beyond
onetime
democratic
presidential
candidate
george
mcgovern
way
beyond
any
of
the
liberals
they
previously
nominated
i
think
they
make
it
almost
impossible
for
them
to
win
a
general
election
he
told
hemmer
fleischer
who
served
as
press
secretary
under
president
george
w.
bush
from
also
pointed
to
profound
ideological
divides
between
the
party's
moderate
and
progressive
wings
you
saw
that
tension
build
at
the
beginning
of
the
debate
where
they
spent
about
half
an
hour
on
medicare-for-all
and
you
heard
democrats
like
biden
and
minnesota
senator
amy
klobuchar
are
warning
the
rest
of
the
field
how
dangerous
an
idea
it
is
to
go
this
far
he
said
but
it's
what
bernie
wants
what
warren
wants
juli
n
castro
wants
many
of
the
democrats
want
it
said
fleischer
earlier
friday
morning
on
fox
friends
the
president's
son
donald
trump
jr
told
viewers
that
the
democrats
provided
nothing
to
the
american
people
they
need
people
to
be
dependent
on
big
government
because
if
you're
not
they
really
don't
offer
anything
we
saw
nothing
new
last
night
we
saw
no
plans
and
that's
scary
for
them
fleischer
agreed
with
the
younger
trump's
analysis
because
what
you
saw
in
the
first
two
debates
scared
a
lot
of
people
in
the
middle
and
of
course
on
the
right
the
whole
democratic
agenda
is
putting
the
democrats
in
jeopardy
and
that's
a
huge
issue
in
a
general
election
fleischer
said
the
top
three
democrats
in
the
polls
include
biden
warren
and
sanders
whom
fleischer
says
is
just
not
cutting
it
this
year
he
also
noted
that
warren
feels
fresher
to
voters
although
they're
ideologically
very
much
the
same
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
and
california
senator
kamala
harris
are
following
their
lead
but
not
closely
the
candidates
debated
with
polls
showing
a
majority
of
voters
believe
the
country
is
headed
in
the
wrong
direction
under
president
donald
trump
but
democrats
have
seemingly
yet
to
answer
fundamental
questions
about
who
or
what
the
party
stands
for
beyond
simply
opposing
the
first-term
republican
when
hemmer
asked
if
it
was
possible
that
there
could
be
more
than
one
candidate
sent
to
the
convention
in
milwaukee
next
august
fleischer
told
him
it
was
still
too
soon
to
say
i
still
think
you
have
three
people
at
the
top
and
basically
nobody
else
matters
for
now
and
those
three
are
biden
warren
and
sanders
that
seems
to
be
the
shape
of
the
race
