but
will
also
anger
environmental
groups
the
administration
is
revoking
california's
authority
to
set
strict
fuel
economy
standards
trump
announced
the
move
wednesday
saying
the
decision
was
made
in
order
to
produce
far
less
expensive
cars
for
the
consumer
while
making
cars
safer
at
the
same
time
trump
says
california
cities
destroy
themselves
with
homelessness
this
will
lead
to
more
production
because
of
this
pricing
and
safety
advantage
and
also
due
to
the
fact
that
older
highly
polluting
cars
will
be
replaced
by
new
extremely
environmentally
friendly
cars
trump
tweeted
wednesday
morning
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
emissions
standards
tougher
than
the
federal
government's
goes
back
to
a
waiver
issued
by
congress
during
passage
of
the
clean
air
act
in
the
state
has
long
pushed
automakers
to
adopt
more
fuel-efficient
passenger
vehicles
that
emit
less
pollution
a
dozen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
also
follow
california's
fuel
economy
standards
the
trump
administration
decision
revokes
that
waiver
touching
off
what
is
sure
to
be
another
high-profile
legal
fight
with
the
golden
state
in
anticipation
of
the
move
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
tuesday
that
the
administration's
action
will
hurt
both
u.s.
automakers
and
american
families
he
said
california
would
fight
the
administration
in
federal
court
you
have
no
basis
and
no
authority
to
pull
this
waiver
becerra
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
trump
we're
ready
to
fight
for
a
future
that
you
seem
unable
to
comprehend
california
gov
gavin
newsom
said
the
white
house
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
the
rest
of
the
world
on
cutting
emissions
and
fighting
global
warming
the
president
though
claimed
there
would
be
very
little
difference
in
emissions
between
the
federal
and
california's
standard
but
said
cars
will
be
far
safer
and
much
less
expensive
he
also
predicted
that
a
new
national
standard
for
fuel
economy
will
result
in
more
cars
being
produced
by
the
u.s.
and
more
jobs
the
move
comes
after
the
justice
department
recently
opened
an
antitrust
investigation
into
a
deal
between
california
and
four
automakers
for
tougher
pollution
and
related
mileage
requirements
than
those
sought
by
trump
trump
also
has
sought
to
relax
obama-era
federal
mileage
standards
nationwide
weakening
a
key
effort
by
his
democratic
predecessor
to
slow
climate
change

we

federalism
and
the
role
of
the
states
but
federalism
does
not
mean
that
one
state
can
dictate
standards
for

nation
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
told
the
national
automobile
dealers
association
tuesday
adding
that
higher
fuel
economy
standards
would
hurt
consumers
by
increasing
the
average
sticker
price
of
new
cars
and
requiring
automakers
to
produce
more
electric
vehicles
environmentalists
condemned
the
trump
administration's
move
which
comes
as
gasoline
prices
have
crept
higher
following
a
weekend
drone

that
hobbled
