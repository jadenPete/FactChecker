president
trump
may
be
up
by
more
than
percentage
points
over
his
three
gop
presidential
primary
challengers
in
a
new
fox
news
poll
but
the
way
mark
sanford
sees
it
someone
in
trump's
reelection
team
is
scared
sanford
the
former
gop
south
carolina
governor
and
congressman
launched
his
extreme
long-shot
bid
for
the
republican
presidential
nomination
earlier
this
month
joining
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
and
former
rep
joe
walsh
of
illinois
sanford
tells
fox
news
trump
not
doing
enough
to
tackle
debt
as
sanford
was
getting
in
the
race
his
home
state
was
getting
out
republicans
in
south
carolina
which
holds
the
first
southern
primary
in
the
white
house
race
cancelled
their
presidential
nominating
contest
they
joined
nevada
which
votes
third
in
the
calendar
just
ahead
of
the
palmetto
state
and
kansas
i
think
somebody
in
his
trump's
organization
is
scared
which
is
why
you
squash
these
nominating
contests
sanford
said
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
otherwise
it
makes
no
sense
because
if
you
have
a
chance
to
lock
in
a
percent
win
in
the
world
of
politics
you
do
so
but
trump
campaign
communications
director
tim
murtaugh
told
fox
news
earlier
this
month
the
reelection
campaign
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
cancellation
of
the
contests
these
are
decisions
made
entirely
by
state
parties
and
there
are
volumes
of
historical
precedents
to
support
them
he
said
and
he
also
emphasized
that
president
trump
will
dominate
and
prevail
in
whatever
contest
is
placed
before
him
the
president's
also
dismissed
and
belittled
his
three
primary
challengers
labeling
them
the
three
stooges
in
july
sanford
told
fox
news
i
don't
think
anybody's
going
to
beat
donald
trump
in
a
candid
moment
in
july
when
he
said
he
was
mulling
a
white
house
bid
sanford
told
fox
news
i
always
like
to
be
real
and
i
don't
think
anybody's
going
to
beat
donald
trump
that's
my
personal
opinion
two
months
later
sanford
sounds
less
fatalistic
asked
the
same
question
whether
the
incumbent
president
who's
extremely
popular
among
most
republicans
could
possibly
be
beat
in
the
gop
primaries
sanford
said
we're
at
the
beginning
of
the
process
we'll
find
out
i
mean
that's
what
contests
are
about
you
just
never
know
in
the
world
of
politics
and
he
pointed
to
his
first
election
for
congress
and
for
governor
noting
he
was
an
extreme
underdog
at
the
start
of
those
campaigns
sanford
a
devout
fiscal
conservative
was
a
member
of
the
conservative
house
freedom
caucus
during
his
second
stint
in
congress
rep
andy
biggs
of
arizona
the
incoming
freedom
caucus
chairman
told
the
hill
i
don't
really
have
a
problem
with
what
those
guys
sanford
weld
and
walsh
are
doing
but
the
reality
is
it's
irrelevant
sanford
disagreed
debate
on
issues
that
are
core
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
republican
are
never
irrelevant
the
republican
party
has
lost
its
way
on
spending
we're
looking
now
at
a
trillion-dollar
deficit
this
year
which
is
something
we've
never
run
before
during
benign
economic
conditions
he
responded
the
candidate
was
interviewed
by
fox
news
during
his
first
trip
since
launching
his
white
house
bid
to
new
hampshire
the
state
that
holds
the
first
primary
in
the
nominating
calendar
sanford
was
greeting
voters
at
manchester's
airport
diner
a
must-stop
for
presidential
contenders
and
handing
out
pamphlets
explaining
the
three
goals
of
his
campaign
sanford
said
that
the
first
goal
is
to
spark
a
debate
within
the
republican
party
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
republican
and
in
particular
about
the
degree
that
we're
stacking
up
debt
and
deficit
in
washington
dc
his
second
goal
he
said
is
end
up
with
some
number
of
delegates
such
that
you
can
actually
help
shape
the
republican
platform
on
what
i'm
saying
on
debt
and
deficit
and
sanford
said
his
third
goal
would
be
winning
sanford
hopes
that
his
message
will
resonate
among
republicans
and
independents
in
a
state
with
rich
fiscal
conservative
traditions
as
well
as
a
strong
libertarian
streak
former
south
carolina
governor
and
congressman
mark
sanford
making
his
first
visit
to
new
hampshire
since
launching
his
bid
for
the
gop
presidential
nomination
greets
voters
at
the
airport
diner
in
manchester
on
sept
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
get
folks
in
new
hampshire
bothered
he
noted
i
do
think
it's
a
fertile
ground
from
where
i
come
from
while
sanford
is
challenging
the
president
and
has
been
a
trump
critic
dating
back
to
the
election
don't
plan
on
seeing
sanford
vote
for
a
democrat
in
next
year's
general
election
asked
if
he'd
vote
for
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
in
if
trump
is
the
gop's
presidential
nominee
sanford
said
he
didn't
think
so
i'm
going
to
vote
conservative
and
i'm
going
to
vote
for
the
conservative
choice
he
explained
and
he
said
even
though
he
blames
trump
for
doing
serious
harm
to
people's
trust
in
the
republican
party
as
being
the
party
of
financial
stewardship
he
said
the
president
would
be
better
than
the
democratic
alternative
