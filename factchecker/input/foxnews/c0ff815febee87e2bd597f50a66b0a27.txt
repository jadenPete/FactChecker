washington
is
rescinding
million
directed
to
afghanistan
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
announced
thursday
citing
unacceptable
levels
of
corruption
in
the
afghan
government
the
u.s.
will
still
complete
the
energy
project
which
was
to
account
for
million
of
the
funding
but
it
won't
be
directing
the
money
through
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani's
government
which
pompeo
said
is
incapable
of
being
a
partner
pompeo
blamed
the
afghan
government's
inability
to
transparently
manage
u.s.
government
resources
for
walking
back
the
funds
but
said
the
u.s.
would
still
build
the
five
power

washington
is
withholding
the
other
million
in
aid
and
will
not
be
redirecting
it
to
projects
in
afghanistan
on
the
belief
that
ghani's
government
is
neither
transparent
nor
accountable
in
its
spending
taliban
violence
in
afghanistan
ramps
up
as
suicide
bomb
kills
at
least
the
u.s.
is
also
cutting
off
all
funding
to
the
afghan
body
in
charge
of
government
corruption
the
monitoring
and
evaluation
committee
saying
it
is
incapable
of
being
a
partner
in
the
international
effort
to
build
a
better
future
for
the
afghan
people
we
stand
against
those
who
exploit
their
positions
of
power
and
influence
to
deprive
the
afghan
people
of
the
benefits
of
foreign
assistance
and
a
more
prosperous
future
pompeo
said
in
a
statement
special
inspector
general
for
afghan
reconstruction
john
sopko
cited
reports
dating
back
nine
years
in
which
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
u.s.
aid
to
the
nation
is
missing
wasted
on
corrupt
contracts
and
wasteful
spending

afghanistan
president
donald
trump's
halt
to
u.s.
taliban
talks
looks
like
a
gift
to
the
beleaguered
afghan
president
who
has
insisted
on
holding
a
key
election
in
less
than
three
weeks
time
despite
widespread
expectations
that
a
peace
deal
would
push
it
aside

after

in
the
nation
and
billion

the
u.s.
decision
to
pull
back
funding
from
afghanistan
marks
a
significant
pivot-
the
afghan
government
depends
almost
entirely
on
foreign
assistance
the
decision
comes
one
day
after
the
u.s.
ambassador
to
afghanistan
john
bass
called
out
the
national
procurement
authority
on
twitter
for
not
approving
the
purchase
of
fuel
for
thermal
electricity

pompeo
said
his
intended
message
for
ghani
is
that
the
u.s.
wants
to
see
free
and
fair
elections
on
sept
when
ghani
will
face
off
against
competitors
for
a
second
five-year
term
the
presidential
election
was
riddled
with
widespread
fraud
as
was
the
parliamentary
election
last
year
the
presidential
election
has
already
been
delayed
twice
and
the
taliban
denounced
the
election
as
a
sham
and
vowed
to
attack
rallies-
on
sept
they
attacked
a
campaign
rally
for
ghani
killing
and
wounding
the
taliban
want
the
election
canceled
as
a
condition
for
intra-afghan
dialogue
and
some
of
ghani's
main
opponents
have
dropped
out
of
the
race
for
the
sake
of
peace
