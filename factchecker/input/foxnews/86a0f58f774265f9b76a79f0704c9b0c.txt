bombshell

many
of
the
major
democratic
candidates
for
president
over
the
weekend
released
statements
calling
for
congress
to
impeach
kavanaugh
citing
the
times
reporting
of
an
uncorroborated
and
disputed
college-era
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
as
a
reason
to
impeach
but
late
sunday
the
paper
revised
its
portrayed
blockbuster
story
to
include
the
fact
that
several
friends
of
the
alleged
victim
said
she
told
them
she
did
not
recall
the
reported
sexual
assault
in
question
but
that
didn't
prompt
democrats
to
revise
or
walk

fox

has
reached
out
to
the
democrats
who
called

over

to
ask
if

who
said
over
the
weekend
that
kavanaugh
must
be
impeached
did
not
back
down
in
a
new
tweet
monday
saying
the
reality
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
is
that
it
lacked
any
integrity
there
has
never
been
a
meaningful
investigation
into
these
allegations

the

from
their

that

saw
mr

with
his
pants
down
at
a
different
drunken
dorm
party
where
friends
pushed
his

into
the
hand
of
a

the

did
not
mention
stier's
work
as
a
clinton
defense
attorney
or
his
legal
battles
with
kavanaugh
during
the
whitewater
investigation
according
to
the
times
stier
notified
senators
and
the
fbi
about
this
account
last
year
during
the
kavanaugh
hearings
but
the
fbi
did
not
investigate
and
mr
stier
has
declined
to
discuss
it
publicly
however
the
times
article
also
initially
did
not
mention
that
pogrebin
and
kelly's
book
found
that
the
female
student
in
question
did
not
recall
the
alleged
episode
in
its
update
the
paper
later
said
editors
note
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
which
was
adapted
from
a
forthcoming
book
did
not
include
one
element
of
the
book's
account
regarding
an
assertion
by
a
yale
classmate
that
friends
of
brett
kavanaugh
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
the
book
reports
that
the
female
student
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
say
that
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
that
information
has
been
added
to
the
article
still
the
earlier
reporting
ignited
an
avalanche
of
impeachment
calls
former
hud
secretary
julian
castro
tweeted
it's
more
clear
than
ever
that
brett
kavanaugh
lied
under
oath
he
should
be
impeached
and
congress
should
review
the
failure
of
the
department
of
justice
to
properly
investigate
the
matter
said
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
last
year
the
kavanaugh
nomination
was
rammed
through
the
senate
without
a
thorough
examination
of
the
allegations
against
him
confirmation
is
not
exoneration
and
these
newest
revelations
are
disturbing
like
the
man
who
appointed
him
kavanaugh
should
be
impeached
kavanaugh
must
be
impeached
top
dems
say
as
uncorroborated
allegation
resurfaces
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
said
yesterday
we
learned
of
another
accusation
against
brett
kavanaugh
one
we
didn't
find
out
about
before
he
was
confirmed
because
the
senate
forced
the
fbi
to
rush
its
investigation
to
save
his
nomination
we
know
he
lied
under
oath
he
should
be
impeached
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
tweeted
in
part
this
new
allegation
and
additional
corroborating
evidence
adds
to
a
long
list
of
reasons
why
brett
kavanaugh
should
not
be
a
supreme
court
justice
i
stand
with
survivors
and
countless
other
americans
in
calling
for
impeachment
proceedings
to
begin
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
said
kavanaugh
should
resign
and
if
he
doesn't
the
house
should
impeach
him
on
capitol
hill
the
news
prompted
outrage
from
democrats
but
whether
that
could
translate
into
another
dramatic
investigation
remains
to
be
seen
in
his
interview
with
the
brian
lehrer
show
on
monday
nadler
suggested
his
committee
is
more
focused
on
impeaching
the
president
but
he
signaled
openness
to
at
least
reviewing
allegations
against
kavanaugh
pressed
by
the
host
nadler
ripped
the
fbi's
investigation
of
the
allegations
as
a
sham
and
said
it
might
fall
under
our
jurisdiction
we'd
have
to
take
a
look
at
that
others
on
the
campaign
trail
raised
concerns
about
kavanaugh
but
didn't
explicitly
call
for
impeachment
former
vice
president
joe
biden
said
this
weekend's
report
in
the
new
york
times
raises
again
profoundly
troubling
questions
about
the
integrity
of
the
confirmation
process
that
put
brett
kavanaugh
on
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
place
sen
bernie
sanders
said
he
backed
going
after
kavanaugh
by
any
legal
means
available
the
revelations
today
confirm
what
we
already
knew
during
his
hearing
kavanaugh
faced
credible
accusations
and
likely
lied
to
congress
i
support
any
appropriate
constitutional
mechanism
to
hold
him
accountable
sen
amy
klobuchar
stopped
short
of
calling
for
impeachment
and
instead
posted
a
picture
of
kavanaugh
accuser
christine
blasey
ford
with
the
words
let
us
never
forget
what
courage
looks
like
carrie
severino
calls
out
new
york
times
shameful
attempt
to
reignite
smears
against
kavanaugh
conservatives
have
ripped
into
democrats
for
their
calls
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
weak
type
of
allegations
it's
really
a
shameful
attempt
to
reignite
these
smears
against
judge
kavanaugh
that
are
utterly
baseless
carrie
severino
the
founder
of
the
judicial
crisis
network
who
recently
wrote
a
sympathetic
book
about
kavanaugh
said
on
fox
friends
trump
for
his
part
suggested
sunday
that
kavanaugh
should
sue
for
defamation
still
other
democrats
ramped
up
their
criticism
of
kavanaugh
on
monday
it
is
unsurprising
that
kavanaugh
credibly
accused
of
sexual
assault
would
lie
under
oath
to
secure
a
supreme
court
seat
tweeted
new
york
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
because
sexual
assault
isn't
a
crime
of
passion
it's
about
the
abuse
of
power
he
must
be
impeached
