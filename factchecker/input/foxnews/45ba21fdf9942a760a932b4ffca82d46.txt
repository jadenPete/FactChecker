the

comes
as
some
sanders
supporters
in

are
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
sen

n.h.
recent
polls
in
the
state
have
fluctuated
a
live
telephone
operator
survey
from
the
boston
herald
and
franklin
pierce
university
indicated
sanders
at
percent
overall
front-runner
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
at
percent
and
elizabeth
warren
at
percent
but
another
recent
poll
suggested
a
three-way
tie
between
the
three
top-tier
contenders
and
a
third
suggested
sanders
lagging
behind
biden
and
warren
sanders
ahead
of
biden
and
warren
in
nh
in
most
recent
nh
poll
sanders
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
said
in
a
statement
on
sunday
that
we've
built
a
great
team
in
nh
and
are
in
a
really
strong
position
there
the
campaign
is
now
building
out
our
operations
to
include
massachusetts
and
maine
state
directors
as
we
increase
our
focus
in
super
tuesday
states
we
are
running
a
state
campaign
taking
no
state
or
voters
for
granted
and
expanding
our
operations
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
caiazzo
was
moved
to
one
of
those
super
tuesday
states
massachusetts
caiazzo
served
as
sanders
campaign's
state
director
in
both
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
but
shakir's
statement
runs
counter
to
what
another
steering
committee
member
who
also
asked
for
anonymity
emphasized
pointing
to
the
campaign
the
supporter
said
they
didn't
listen
to
anything
the
steering
committee
suggested
the
supporter
also
lamented
that
some
bernie
backers
were
going
to
warren
because
the
campaign
didn't
listen
to
them
the
latest
from
fox
news
on
the
presidential
campaign
sanders
has
repeatedly
refrained
from
calling
new
hampshire
a
must
win
state
this
is
obviously
a
very
important
state
as
is
iowa
south
carolina
we're
working
hard
we're
going
to
do
many
many
rallies
around
the
state
and
i'm
feeling
pretty
good
he
said
during
a
stop
in
the
state
on
labor
day
but
a
veteran
granite
state-based
political
scientist
said
the
first
primary
state's
crucial
to
both
sanders
and
warren
new
hampshire
is
a
must-win-or-place
state
for
senators
sanders
and
warren
said
wayne
lesperance
the
vice
president
of
academic
affairs
and
a
political
science
professor
at
new
england
college
for
both
candidates
there
is
no
better
home-field
advantage
in
the
early
states
than
the

the
state's
february

presidential
primary
launching
the
one-time
longshot
into
an
epic
and
marathon
battle
with
the
eventual
nominee
sanders
support
and
organization
in
the
state
stayed
very
strong
even
he
ended
his
first
white
house
bid
his
steering
committee
has
met
monthly
ever
since
the
general
election
but
the
race
is
a
very
different
contest
and
sanders
is
now
facing
rivals
who
are
preaching
the
same
progressive
policies
that
he
first
made
mainstream
in
the
democratic
party
four
years
ago
the
transfer
of
caiazzo
to
massachusetts
and
of
jackson
to
new
hampshire
came
a
day
after
the
campaign
parted
ways
with
senior
new
hampshire
adviser
kurt
ehrenberg
get
the
fox
news
app
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
clear
and
fundamental
disagreement
between
mr
caiazzo
and
myself
on
how
to
run
a
successful
presidential
primary
campaign
in
new
hampshire
ehrenberg
told
fox
news
on
sunday
ehrenberg
a
longtime
grassroots
and
labor
organizer
set
up
the
crucial
new

organization
for
sanders

bid
from

and
summer
