reports
from
albuquerque
former
vice
president
joe
biden
made
another
gaffe
on
tuesday
this
time
suggesting
that
his
child
tax
credit
plan
will
put
million
women
back
into
the
workforce
speaking
at
the
workers
presidential
summit
in
philadelphia
the
frontrunner
mocked
the
idea
of
having
a
tax
break
for
a
racehorse
and
not
one
for
having
children
you
get
a
tax
break
for
a
racehorse
why
in
god's
name
couldn't
we
provide
an
tax
credit
for
everybody
who
has
childcare
costs
biden
told
the
crowd
it
would
put
million
women
back
in
the
workforce
it
would
increase
the
gdp
to
sound
like
a
wonk
here
by
about
eight-tenths
of
one
percent
it
would
grow
the
economy

to

biden's
gaffes
stumbles
and
fitness
to
lead
for
office
under
fire
in
new
trump
campaign
video
biden's
gaffes
have
recently
been
targeted
by
the
trump
campaign
in
a
new
video
questioning
his
fitness
to
lead
the
web
video
tweeted
tuesday
morning
by
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
and
shared
first
with
fox
news
stitches
together
everything
from
his
recent
debate-stage
musing
about
record
players
to
his
statement
that
poor
kids
are
just
as
talented
as
white
kids
interspersed
with
the
clips
of
the
year-old
biden's
comments
are
those
of
pundits
wondering
about
his
stumbles
shakiness
mental
and
physical
stamina
whether
he's
lost
a
step
and
whether
he's
equipped
for
a
very
grueling
campaign
the
former
vice
president's
age
and
mental
acuity
have
been
questioned
ever
since
he
launched
his
presidential
campaign
in
late
april
last
week
the
front-runner
in
the
democratic
nomination
race
faced
repeated
attacks
from
rivals
over
his
memory
former
housing
secretary
julian
castro
who
served
in
the
obama
administration
with
biden
landed
arguably
the
lowest
blow
when
he
swiped
at
biden's
memory
accusing
him
of
contradicting
himself
on
whether
americans
would
have
to
buy
into
his
health
care
plan
you
just
said
two
minutes
ago
they
would
have
to
buy
in
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
asked
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
reference
to
past
senior
moments
by
biden
in
that
case
as
the
biden
campaign
later
noted
castro
was
wrong
biden
did
not
say
during
the
debate
that
individuals
would
have
to
buy
in
instead
he
said
that
individuals
would
automatically
be
enrolled
if
they
lost
their
jobs
but
biden
has
drawn
criticism
for
other
stumbles
and
another
rival
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
backed
castro
after
the
debate
and
raised
further
questions
about
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
banner
for
the
democrats

i
think
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
told
cnn
in
an
interview
and
i
think
that
castro
had
really
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
and
has
every
right
to
call
out
a
clip
of
that
booker
interview
appears
in
