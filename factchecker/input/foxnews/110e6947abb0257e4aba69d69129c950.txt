answered
i
don't
think

any

complaint
when
axelrod
asked
about
the
potential
effect
of
putting
trump
on
trial
referencing
president
gerald
ford's
decision
to
pardon
his
predecessor
richard
nixon
following
his
resignation
in
holder
was
more
circumspect
i
think
there
is
a
potential
cost
to
the
nation
by
putting
on
trial
a
former
president
and
that
ought
to
at
least
be
a
part
of
the
calculus
that
goes
into
the
determination
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
next
attorney
general
he
said
adding
that
while
ford's
pardon
of
nixon
may
have
cost
him
the
election
looking
back
i
tend
to
think
that
that
was
probably
the
right

also
said
that
congress
should
proceed
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
but
added
that
doesn't
necessarily
commit
you
to
actually
impeaching
the
president
these
comments
come
after

vote
thursday
to
formalize
the
