not

take

andrew
mccabe
faces
possible
criminal
indictmentjudge
jeanine
sits
down
one
on
one
with
rep
jim
jordan
to
discuss
andrew
mccabe's
potential
indictment
former
fbi
deputy
director
and
cnn
contributor
andrew
mccabe
slammed
the
department
of
justice's
ongoing
criminal
probe
into
his
conduct
in
office
and
insisted
that
he
would
not
take
a
plea
deal
if
he
is
prosecuted
appearing
on
cuomo
prime
time
mccabe
blasted
the
investigation
conducted
by
doj
inspector
general
michael
horowitz
saying
he
absolutely
rejects
his
findings
and
conclusions
i
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
about
anything
and
i
certainly
have
not
committed
a
crime
mccabe
told
cnn
anchor
chris
cuomo
on
tuesday
night
i
was
asked
questions
on
two
separate
occasions
about
an
article
that
had
appeared
months
before
i
was
asked
questions
completely
unprompted
in
the
middle
of
other
far
more
intense
and
challenging
issues
that
were
swirling
around
me
at
the
time
when
i
thought
after
the
fact
that
those
answers
may
have
been
inaccurate
or
mistaken
i
reached
out
to
those
folks
to
make
sure
that
they
understood
exactly
what
i
meant
and
understood
exactly
what
the
situation
was
at
this
point
i
am
confident
that
if
they
follow
the
facts
and
they
follow
the
law
i
have
absolutely
nothing
to
worry
about
cnn's
legal
guru
weighs
in
defense
of
colleague
and
friend
andrew
mccabe
so
if
they
bring
a
case
and
your
lawyers
say
listen
there's
some
questions
here
and
they're
offering
a
deal
we
think
this
was
inconsistent
we
called
it
lack
of
candor
now
it's
going
to
be
a
perjury
charge
we
believe
you
gave
false
information
cuomo
said
they
offer
you
a
deal
will
you
take
a
deal
in
order
to
go
on
with
the
rest
of
your
life
if
there's
no
big
criminal
attachment
and
you
don't
have
to
do
any
time
or
anything
absolutely
not
under
any
circumstances
mccabe
quickly
responded
no
deal
cuomo
followed
absolutely
not
under
any
circumstances
the
ex-fbi
official
reiterated
i
have
said
from
the
very
beginning
i
absolutely
reject
that
report
because
i
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
about
anything
and
i
will
not
stand
up
and
claim
that
i
have
done
something
that
i
didn't
do
so
it
won't
happen

rejected
mccabe's
appeal
regarding
an
ongoing
criminal
probe
as
u.s.
attorney
jessie
liu
recommended
proceeding
with
criminal
charges
against
the
former
fbi
official
the
probe
is
exploring
whether
he
misled
investigators
concerning
a
media
leak
about
the
clinton
foundation
just
before
the
election
mccabe
who
was
forced
out
of
the
doj
