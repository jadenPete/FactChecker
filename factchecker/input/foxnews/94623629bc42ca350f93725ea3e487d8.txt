way
you
deal
with

is
finding
purpose
biden
said
i
hope
beau
is
proud
of
me
today
because
when
you
get

badly
when
you
lose
a
job
we've
all
been
through
that
in
some
form
or
another
he
continued
my
purpose
is
do
what
i've
always
tried
to
do
and
stay
engaged
in
public
policy
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who've
had
it
a
lot
worse
than
i
have
