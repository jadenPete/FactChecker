the
white
tents
that
sit
here
on
the
very
edge
of
the
u.
s
border
with
mexico
a
literal
stone's
throw

represent
one
of
the
jewels
in
the
crown
of
the
trump
administration's
recent
efforts
to
get
a
grip
on
the
immigration
crisis
they
are
the
temporary
courtrooms
set
up
as
part
of
the
migrant
protection
protocols
mpp
known
colloquially
as
the
remain
in
mexico
policy
that
policy
established
earlier
this
year
involves
sending
migrants
who
are
trying
to
claim
asylum
back
to
mexico
during
their
proceedings
instead
of
releasing
them
into
the
u.s.
while
their
cases
are
heard
trump

enters

phase

sets
ambitious
timetable
after
securing

this
means
officials
say
that
cases
can
be
heard
more
quickly
within
as
little
as
days
as
opposed
to
the
years
it
sometimes
takes
after
family
units
are
released
into
the
u.s.
they
say
that's
better
for
the
migrants
as
it
leaves
them
in
limbo
for
less
time
but
they
argue
it
also
serves
as
a
disincentive
for
central
american
migrants
who
do
not
have
legitimate
asylum
claims
but
might
otherwise
get
into
the
u.s.
by
claiming
credible
fear
of
returning
home
the
white
tents
along
the
border
right
now
are
meant
to
handle
the
growing
asylum
claims
with
the
backlog
now
at
more
than
cases
the
courtrooms
recently
were
set
up
in
laredo
and
brownsville
texas
but
the
administration
is
hoping
to
set
up
more
such
tents
across
the
border
soon
expanding
amid
greater
cooperation
with
mexico
cuccinelli
on

yet
the
proceedings
have
come
under
fire
from
immigration
advocates
the
group
human
rights
first
has
called
them
secretive
and
described
them
as
part
of
an
attack
on
due
process
within
a
sham
asylum
system
the
same
group
recently
charged
that
they've
been
closed
to
the
media
and
public
observers
advocates
see
the
courts
as
simply
another
hurdle

morgan
told
reporters
at
the

more
than
migrants
have
been
sent
back
to
mexico
under

but
it
appears
only
a
sliver
of
migrants
ever
get
accepted
and
allowed
into
the
u.s.
when
asked
about
this
officials
didn't
say
how
many
had
been
allowed
into
the
u.s.
via
mpp
and
the
department
of
justice's
executive
office
for

review
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
that
number
albence
said
that
many
of
those
put
into
mpp
decide
to
give
up
and
head
home
and
officials
believe
that
as
that
continues
to
happen
it
will
stop
migrants
from
making
the
dangerous
journey
north
from
central
america
critics
however
say
that
the
administration
is
setting
too
high
of
a
bar
for
entry
and
have
questioned
the
legality
of
the
program
the
program
has
also
come
under
fire
over
a
series
of
reports
that
migrants
sent
back
to
mexico
are
facing
violence
when
they
get
there
a

with

alleged
in

that
the

is
meant
to
foreclose

from

was
asked
about
the
reports
of
violence
against
migrants
in
mexico
and
said
that
while
the
u.s.
is
assisting
mexico
what
goes
on
inside
the
country
is
ultimately
mexico's
responsibility

we
have
to
be
very
very
careful
as
our

to
paint
an

as

he
added
i
don't
believe
that
we
are
not
receiving
that
information
from
the
government
of
mexico
cuccinelli
said
that
just
percent
of
migrants
claim
they
fear
going
back
to
mexico
and
about
one
in
six
of
those
are
found
to
have
a
reasonable
fear
of
going
back
while
they
wait
for
their
hearing
albence
said
as
well
that
much
of
the
crisis
is
fueled
by
the
loopholes
still
present
in
the
u.s.
immigration
system
and
called
on
congress
to
act
the
courtrooms
are
just
one
piece
in
the
jigsaw
of
efforts
by
the
administration
to
crack
down
on
the
migrant
crisis
and
officials
have
been
keen
to
promote
what
they
see
as
initial
signs
of
success
the
administration
announced
last
week
that
immigration
officials
apprehended
at
the
border
in
august
a
percent
drop
from
july
and
a
percent
drop
from
the
peak
of
the
crisis
in
may
when
more
than
migrants
were
caught
or
deemed
inadmissible
officials
say
that
the
agreements
with
mexico
in
particular
but
also
with
guatemala
el
salvador
and
panama
are
helping
stem
the
flow
as
those
countries
implement
policies
to
staff
up
their
borders
and

down
on

and
