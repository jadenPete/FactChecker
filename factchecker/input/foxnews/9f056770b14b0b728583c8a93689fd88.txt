controversy

phone

centers

as

decries
partisan
complaint
the
wall
street
journal
reported
friday
that
in
a
july
phone
call
trump
repeatedly
asked
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
work
with
trump
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
on
a
probe
into
hunter
biden
the
call
came
a
month
before
trump
put
a
hold
on
million
in
military
aid
to
ukraine
a
hold
that
was
eventually
released
after
objections
from
the
senate
joe
biden
now
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
has
faced
scrutiny
for
months
over
his
past
role
pressuring
the
country
to
fire
its
top
prosecutor
while
he
was
leading
a
corruption
investigation
into
a
natural
gas
company
that
had
ties
to
hunter
giuliani
has
suggested
that
biden
as
vp
worked
to
protect
the
company
from
investigation
in
a
lengthy
statement
friday
evening
biden
said
that
if
the
reports
were
true
there
is
truly
no
bottom
to
president
trump's
willingness
to
abuse
his
power
and
abase
our
country
this
behavior
is
particularly
abhorrent
because
it
exploits
the
foreign
policy
of
our
country
and
undermines
our
national
security
for
political
purposes
biden
continued
it
means
that
he
used
the
power
and
resources
of
the
united
states
to
pressure
a
sovereign
nation
a
partner
that
is
still
under
direct
assault
from
russia
pushing
ukraine
to
subvert
the
rule
of
law
in
the
express
hope
of
extracting
a
political
favor
at
minimum
biden
concluded
donald
trump
should
immediately
release
the
transcript
of
the
call
in
question
so
that
the
american
people
can
judge
for
themselves
and
direct
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
to
stop
stonewalling
and
release
the
whistleblower
notification
to
the
congress
what
initially
touched

the
controversy
