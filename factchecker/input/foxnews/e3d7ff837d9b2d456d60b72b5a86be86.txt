reveals
what
he
said
about
bin
laden
to
george
w.
bush
after
since
the
attacks
security
at
airports
across
the
nation
has
remained
heightened
and
a
number
of
additional
measures
were
implemented
one
of
the
biggest
changes
post-
was
the
creation
of
the
transportation
security
administration
which
came
into
being
when
congress
passed
a
law
creating
the
security
organization
only
a
few
months
after
the
attack
before
airport
security
was
generally
handled
by
private
security
companies
one
of
the
main
tasks
of
tsa
agents
is
to
inspect
travelers
and
their
luggage
for
weapons
explosive
devices
and
any
other
banned
substances
before
they
head
to
their
gate
this
is
why
unless
a
person
has
tsa
precheck
travelers
have
to
take
off
jackets
hats
shoes
and
belts
and
empty
their
pockets
before
passing
through
body-scanning
devices
along
with
the
routine
screening
measures
some
travelers
especially
those
on
watchlists
or
who
fit
a
certain
profile
are
selected
for
additional
screening
measures
by
tsa
officials

the
agency
also
regulates
what
travelers
can
carry
on
planes
with
items
like
knives
box
cutters
darts
baseball
bats
and
scissors
now
banned
the

further
limits
the
amount
of
liquid
travelers
can
take
through
security
the
attacks
saw
changes
inside
the
airplane
too
with
cockpits
being
sealed
and
locked
to
prevent
passengers
from
entering
and
an
increase
of
air
marshals
on
flights
while
all
the
extra
security
has
forced
travelers
to
arrive
at
airports
much
earlier
than
before
the
attacks
with
it
being
recommended
that
travelers
show
up
three
hours
before
their
flight
when
traveling
international
it
has
also
been
credited
with
preventing
a
similar
type
of
attack
to
the
one
witnessed
years
ago
