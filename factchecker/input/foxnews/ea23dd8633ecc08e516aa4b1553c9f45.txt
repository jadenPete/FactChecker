vice

joe
biden
came
under
attack
during
the
third
democratic
debate
his
age
and
memory
came
into
question
new
jersey
senator
and
hopeful
corey
booker
say
people
have
a
right
to
be
concerned
former
vice
president
joe
biden
came
under
sustained
and
withering
fire
thursday
when
fellow
democrats
renewed
their
attacks
on
his
age
memory
and
alleged
rambling
as
his
allies
scolded
them
for
the
low
blows
and
warned
the
approach
won't
pave
the
way
to
victory
biden
fought
back
over
the
course
of
the
three-hour
debate
in
houston
and
landed
several
jabs
of
his
own
on
fellow
democrats
battling
for
the
nomination
but
the
attacks
on
his
mental
acuity
which
continued
after
the
debate
ended
re-opened
an
issue
he's
tried
to
put
to
rest
signaling
another
nasty
and
personal
phase
in
the
primary
race
as
lower-polling
candidates
fight
to
take
down
the
front-runner
debate
descends
into
melee
over
health
care
obama
socialism
as
dems
struggle
to
show
unity
former
housing
secretary
julian
castro
who
served
in
the
obama
administration
with
biden
landed
arguably
the
lowest
blow
when
he
swiped
at
biden's
memory
accusing
him
of
contradicting
himself
on
whether
americans
would
have
to
buy
into
his
health
care
plan
you
just
said
two
minutes
ago
they
would
have
to
buy
in
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
asked
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
reference
to
past
senior
moments
by
biden
however
biden
did
not
say
during
the
debate
that
individuals
would
have
to
buy
in
instead
he
said
that
individuals
would
automatically
be
enrolled
if
they
lost
their
jobs
biden
adviser
anita
dunn
checked
castro
later
in
the
spin
room
saying
that
his
cheap
shot
was
based
on
a
lie
i
think
castro
who
likes
to
talk
about
learning
from
history
clearly
didn't
learn
from
the
first
two
debates
that
taking
personal
cheap
shots
at
vice
president
biden
actually
doesn't
work
out
that
well
for
the
candidate
who
throws
the
shot
dunn
told
reporters
it's
unfortunate
that
castro
decided
to
go
the
route
he
did
on
abc
news
former
obama
chief
of
staff
rahm
emanuel
said
that
the
way
castro
handled
the
moment
was
a
disqualifier
it
will
come
across
as
mean
and
vindictive
that's
not
who
he
is
biden
camp
warns
rivals
says
attacking
former
vp
not
the
way
to
improve
polls
biden's
team
defended
him
in
the
post-debate
spin-room
with
deputy
campaign
manager
kate
bedingfield
saying
that
candidates
have
seen
not
just
in
the
debates
but
over
the
course
of
this
campaign
that
attacking
joe
biden
is
not
the
way
to
advance
yourself
in
the
polls
the
sustained
attacks
though
raise
concerns
that
barbs
from
longshot
candidates
such
as
castro
who
is
polling
in
low
single
digits
could
kneecap
biden
as
front-runner
and
leave
him
weakened
for
the
general
election
race
should
he
emerge
the
nominee
still
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
publicly
backed
castro
after
the
debate
and
raised
further
questions
about
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
banner
for
the
democrats
into
i
think
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
told
cnn
in
an
interview
and
i
think
that
castro
had
really
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
and
has
every
right
to
call
out
biden
did
fumble
on
a
number
of
occasions
during
the
debate
supplying
more
political
ammo
to
his
rivals
at
one
point
he
said
that
nobody
should
be
in
jail
for
a
non-violent
crime
which
would
come
as
great
news
to
people
like
former
trump
associates
michael
cohen
and
paul
manafort
who
are
both
serving
prison
time
for
non-violent
offenses
his
campaign
later
clarified
he
was
talking
about
non-violent
drug
offenses
he
also
falsely
claimed
the
obama
administration
didn't
lock
people
up
in
cages
further
he
was
mocked
online
when
he
urged
people
to
spend
evenings
watching
television
and
to
make
sure
you
have
the
record
player
on
at
night
the
reference
to
record
players
despite
having
a
certain
hipster
cachet
drew
twitter
teasing
while
others
drew
attention
to
the
lengthy
rambling
answer
to
what
was
a
question
on
racism
booker
made
reference
to
this
too
in
his
post-debate
blasting
of
biden
at
one
point
he
was
talking
about
communities
like
mine
listening
to
record
players
he
said
i
don't
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
a
record
player
but
there
are
definitely
moments
where
you
listen
to
joe
biden
and
you
just
wonder
when
asked
if
he
was
saying
biden
is
too
old
to
be
president
booker
said
he
was
definitely
not
saying
that
but
that
the
veteran
politician
has
a
habit
of
meandering
in
his
speeches
i
want
someone
that
can
excite
and
energize
and
call
us
to
a
campaign
like
we
saw
back
in
in
where
we
saw
record
turnouts
and
somebody
that
can
speak
to
the
fullness
of
the
democratic
party
he
said
if
i
believed
joe
biden
was
that
person
i
wouldn't
be
sitting
here
biden
as
the
presumptive
front-runner
has
faced
sustained
attacks
before
while
he
has
been
leading
the
polls
since
his
entrance
in
the
race
his
lead
has
tightened
amid
questions
over
his
