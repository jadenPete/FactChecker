it's

the

is
carefully
limited
both
in
the
extent

the
duration
of
its
power
and
where
the
legislative
power
is
exercised
by
an
assembly
which
is
inspired
by
a
supposed
influence
over
the
people
with
an
intrepid
confidence
in
its
own
strength
it
is
against
the
enterprising

no

out
the

in

the
tremendous
response
we
got
from
readers
last

we
are
linking
back
to
our
musings
from
the
previous
anniversary
of
september
th
one
of
the
most
treasured
and
often
repeated
sayings
about
is
the
line
from
the
widow
of
jason
dahl
the
pilot
of
flight
the
doomed
airliner
that
perhaps
thanks
to
the
courage
of
passengers
and
crew
crashed
in
a
former
pennsylvania
coal
mine
rather
than
its
intended
target
of
the
u.s.
capitol
a
year
later
sandy
dahl
retuned
to
the
scene
as
part
of
her
mission
to
build
a
fitting
memorial
for
her
husband
and
the
other
americans
who
died
there
she
said
if
we
learn
nothing
else
from
this
tragedy
we
learn
that
life
is
short
and
there
is
no
time
for
hate
her
comments
resonated
because
dahl
expressed
what
was
so
much
on
the
hearts
of
americans
the
attacks
came
during
an
era
of
viscous
political
infighting
we
had
a
failed
impeachment
two
years
before
and
just
months
before
the
attack
a
presidential
election
had
remained
unresolved
for
agonizing
days
cynicism
abounded
we
had
been
narrowly
bitterly
divided
we
had
been
hateful
to
each
other
we
had
put

over
country

no
longer
we
said

motto
would
be

the
new
post-abc
poll
is
much
more
in
line
with
other
early
general
election
polls
there
are
signs
not
just
that
trump
is
trailing
but
also
that
he
might
actually
be
regressing
at

slightly

shows
his
approval
dropping
from
percent
in
july
what
was
then
a
high
for
his
presidency
to
percent
today
but
even
if
you
accept
that
not
much
has
fundamentally
changed
the
new
poll
is
bad
for
trump
it
accounts
for
joe
biden's
second-largest
lead
points
over
