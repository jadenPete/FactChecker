former

john
bolton's
resignation
has
resurfaced
tensions
between
perceived
isolationists
and
war
hawks
in
the
republican
party
that
became
apparent
thursday
as
house
gop
conference
chairwoman
liz
cheney

supports
stopping
these
endless
wars

go
greatly
down
cheney
fired
back
by
blasting
paul
as
a
big
loser
and
retweeting
a
post
in
which
trump
likened
paul
to
a
spoiled
brat
without
a
properly
functioning
brain
she
added
that
paul's
motto
seemed
to
be
terrorists
first
america
second
during
the
republican
primaries
paul
was
a
fierce
critic
of
trump
who
attempted
to
humiliate
the
senator
on
the
debate
stage
rand
paul
shouldn't
even
be
on
this
stage
he's
no
he's
got
percent
in
the
polls
i
don't
know
how
he
got
up
here
there
are
far
too
many
people
up
here
anyways
trump
said
during
a
primary
debate
in
california
liz
cheney
blasts
commie
sanders
he
seems
to
have
daddy
issues
with
my
daddy
since
trump's
election
paul
and
trump
have
grown
closer
with
the
kentucky
senator
praising
his
views
on
foreign
policy
when
trump
announced
bolton's
departure
on
tuesday
paul
celebrated
the
decision
the
chances
of
a
war
worldwide
go
greatly
down
he
said
paul
later
responded
to
cheney
by
tweeting
an
article
about
trump
criticizing
the
bush
administration's
foreign
policy
as
a
candidate
hey
liz
cheney
i
feel
like
you
might
just
be
mad
still
about
when
candidate
trump
shredded
your
dad's
failed
foreign
policy
and
endless
wars
he
said
cheney's
father
is
dick
cheney
george
w.
bush's
vice
president
weird
i
don't
see
you
on
stage
here

cheney
jabbed
in
response
oh
right
my
bad
you
had
already
lost
weirdrand
as
liz
cheney
and
paul
exchanged
blows
on
twitter
trump
claimed
that
he
was
more
aggressive
on
foreign
policy
than
bolton
a
perceived
hawk
tucker
hails
firing
of
john
bolton
he
was
fundamentally
a
man
of
the
left
my
views
on
venezuela
and
especially
cuba
were
far
stronger
than
those
of
john
bolton
he
was
holding
me
back
he
said
his
tweet
followed
suspicions
that
bolton's
foreign
policy
was
too
aggressive
for
trump
who
during
his
campaign
promised
to
return
troops
from
the
middle
east
in
explaining
bolton's
departure
trump
claimed
multiple
people
in
the
administration
disagreed
with
the
former
national
security
adviser's
suggestions
it's
unclear
which
foreign
policy
issues
trump
was
referencing
but
his
thursday
tweet
made
clear
that
he
saw
himself
as
stronger
than
bolton
on
issues
involving
both
cuba
and
venezuela

to

he
included
a
tweet
from
sen
marco
rubio
r-fla
who
said
that
trump
told
him
that
many
people
got
his
relationship
with
bolton
wrong
as
he
reminded
me
it's
actually
the
direct
opposite
of
what
many
claim
or
assume
if
in
fact
the
direction
of
policy
changes
it
won't
be
to
make
it
weaker
