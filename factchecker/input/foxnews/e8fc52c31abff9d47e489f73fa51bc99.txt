you
do
wonder
when
biden
speaks
julian
castro
defends
challenging
joe
biden
on
the

stagedemocratic
presidential
candidate
julian
castro
joins
peter
doocy
on
fox
news
night
following
the
third
presidential
debate
in
houston
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
expressed
solidarity
with
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
for
his
controversial
attack
against
former
vice
president
and
frontrunner
joe
biden
i
think
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
said
when
asked
about
castro's
remarks
following
the
debate
and
i
think
that
castro
had
really
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
and
has
every
right
to
call
out
do
you
think
that
biden
did
a
better
job
tonight
cnn
anchor
erin
burnett
asked
do
you
think
that
he
showed
that
he
could
take
the
ball
over
the
line
i
think
there
were
a
lot
of
moments
where
a
number
of
us
were
looking
on
the
stage
when
he
tends
to
go
on
sometimes
booker
responded
at
one
point
he
was
talking
about
communities
like
mine
listening
to
record
players
i
don't
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
a
record
player
but
there
are
definitely
moments
where
you
listen
to
joe
biden
and
you
just
wonder
biden
mocked
for
encouraging
kids
to
listen
to
the
record
player
at
debate
senator
are
you
saying
that
he's
just
too
old
to
be
president
cnn
chief
political
correspondent
dana
bash
reacted
no
i'm
definitely
not
saying
that
because
i've
listened
to
joe
biden
over
the
years
and
often
felt
like
there
were
times
that
he
is
going
on
or
meandering
in
his
speech
booker
said
i
want
someone
that
can
excite
and
energize
and
call
us
to
a
campaign
like
we
saw
back
in
in
where
we
saw
record
turnouts
and
somebody
that
can
speak
to
the
fullness
of
the
democratic
party
if
i
believed
joe
biden
was
that
person
i
wouldn't
be
sitting
here
click
here
to
get
the
fox
news
app
during
a
fiery
exchange
castro
took
a
shot
at
biden's
memory
accusing
him
of
contradicting
himself
about
whether
americans
would
have
to
buy
into
a
public
health
care
option
under
his
plan
or
if
they
would
be
automatically
enrolled
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
castro
said
you're
forgetting
that
