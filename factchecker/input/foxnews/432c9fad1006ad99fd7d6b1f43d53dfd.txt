environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
and
transportation
secretary
elaine
chao
announced
thursday
a
one
national
program
rule
paving
the
way
for
the
federal
government
to
set
national
uniform
standards
for
fuel
economy
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
for
cars
and
light-duty
trucks
in
a
move
to
block
california's
current
requirements
the
trump
administration
claims
the
national
standard
would
give
americans
access
to
vehicles
that
are
less
expensive
safer
and
cleaner
the
administration
also
says
it
will
result
in
millions
of
new
car
sales
boosting
the
u.s.
auto
manufacturing
industry
the
one
national
program
rule
aims
to
prohibit
states
from
imposing
their
own
stricter
standards
as
california
has
done
and
the
administration
challenged
the
golden
state's
ability
to
do
so
today's
action
meets
president
trump's
commitment
to
establish
uniform
fuel
economy
standards
for
vehicles
across
the
united
states
ensuring
that
no
state
has
the
authority
to
opt
out
of
the
nation's
rules
and
no
state
has
the
right
to
impose
its
policies
on
the
rest
of
the
country

with

california's
authority
to
set
its
own
emissions
standards
which
are
tougher
than
the
federal
government's
goes
back
to
a
waiver
issued
by
congress
during
passage
of
the
clean
air
act
in
the
state
has
long
pushed
automakers
to
adopt
more
fuel-efficient
passenger
vehicles
that
emit
less
pollution
a
dozen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
also
follow
california's
fuel
economy
standards
the
trump
administration
decision
revokes
that
waiver
touching
off
what
is
sure
to
be
another
high-profile
legal
fight
with
california
in
anticipation
of
the
move
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
tuesday
that
the
administration's
action
will
hurt
both
u.s.
automakers
and
american
families
he
said
california
would
fight
the
administration
in
federal
court
you
have
no
basis
and
no
authority
to
pull
this
waiver
becerra
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
trump
we're
ready
to
fight
for
a
future
that
you
seem
unable
to
comprehend
epa
general
counsel
matt
leopold
said
thursday
we're
ready
to
defend
our
interpretation
of
the
waiver
withdraw
he
said
they
are
confident
that
the
administration
would
succeed
the
move
comes
after
the
justice
department
recently
opened
an
antitrust
investigation
into
a
deal
between
california
and
four
automakers
for
tougher
pollution
and
related
mileage
requirements
than
those
sought
by
trump

wheeler
said
thursday
that
the
administration
has
asked
california
for
the
legal
authority
for
their
agreement
he
also
took
a
shot
at
california's
environmental
woes
claiming
that
the
state
has
the
worst
air
quality
in
the
united
states
and
that
they
should
put
their
efforts
into
solving
that
problem
we
hope
that
the
state
will
focus
on
these
issues
rather
than
trying
to
set
fuel
economy
standards
for
the
entire
country
