from

in
a
newly
unsealed
filing
in
federal
court
michael
flynn's
legal
team
outlined
more
than
records
that
may
contain
exculpatory
evidence
allegedly
withheld
by
the
government
including
a
memo
from
the
british
government
that's
said
to
warn
about
the
credibility
of
dossier
author
and
fbi
source
christopher
steele
according
to
the
filing
which
was
unsealed
with

a
letter
was
delivered
by
the
british
embassy
to
the
incoming
national
security
team
after
donald
trump's
election
and
to
outgoing
national

adviser

that
apparently
disavows

british
secret
service
agent
christopher
steele
calls
his
credibility
into
question
and
declares
him
untrustworthy
fox
news
has
reached
out
to
the
british
embassy
and
an
attorney
for
rice
for
comment
about
the
claim
nevertheless
the
fbi
relied
on
steele's
work
funded
by
hillary
clinton's
campaign
and
the
democratic
national
committee
through

flynn's
legal
team
also
sought
documentation
concerning
former
acting
attorney
general
sally
yates
regarding
her
opinion
that
the
jan
surprise
interview
of
mr
flynn
was
problematic
and
her
lack
of
clarity
of
the
fbi's
purpose
in
investigating
mr
flynn
flynn
was
not
charged
with
wrongdoing
as
a
result
of
the
substance
of
his
calls
with
then-russian
ambassador
sergey
kislyak
that
were
the
subject
of
that
interview
and
a
washington
post
article
published
one
day
before
flynn's
white
house
interview
with
the
agents
citing
fbi
sources
publicly
revealed
that
the
fbi
had
wiretapped
flynn's
calls
and
already
cleared
him
of
any
criminal
conduct
flynn
was
charged
with
one
count
of
lying
to
the
fbi
for
his
allegedly
equivocal
responses
to
fbi
agents
during
that
interview
flynn
told
agents
not
really
when
asked
if
he
had
sought
to
convince
kislyak
not
to
escalate
a
brewing
fight
with
the
u.s.
over
sanctions
imposed
by
the
obama
administration
according
to

documents
doj
memo
allegedly
cleared
flynn
of
being
russian
agent
and
now
it's
missing
the
fbi
including
then-deputy

mccabe
pushed
flynn
not
to
have
a
lawyer
present
at
what
seemed
to
be
a
casual
meeting
at
the
white
house
flynn
later
said
the
former
national
security
adviser's
lawyers
argued
in
a
status
conference
this
week
that
the
case
against
flynn
should
be
thrown
out
accusing
the
prosecution
of
egregious
conduct
and
suppression
of
evidence
before
and
after
his
guilty
plea
andrew

on
whether
the

played

former
assistant

flynn
lawyer
sidney
powell
convinced
u.s.
district
court
judge
emmet
sullivan
to
schedule
a
hearing
on
whether
so-called
brady
material
evidence
helpful
to
the
defense
was
unconstitutionally
withheld
the
developments
come
ahead
of
a
scheduled
december
sentencing
date
which
sullivan
warned
the
parties
could
be
moved
again
we've
learned
that
there
was
a
letter
dated
jan
or
an
internal
memo
from
the
department
of
justice
that
completely
exonerates
mr
flynn
of
being
an
agent
of
russia
and
that
document
has
not
been
produced
to
us
yet
powell
said
according
to
a
transcript
of
tuesday's
hearing
obtained
by
fox
news
flynn
legal
team
accuses
prosecutors
of
misconduct
powell
continued
so
they
had
a
lot
of
information
that
they
didn't
disclose
they
also
have
knowledge
of
a
letter
from
the
british
embassy
that
completely
discredits
trump
dossier
author
christopher
steele
and
undoes
the
whole
steele
dossier
debacle
fox
news
learned
about
the
memo's
existence
last
week
asked
by
fox
news
earlier
this
week
if
they
were
aware
of
the
memo
and
could
provide
it
a
doj
official
said
they
would
try
to
identify
it
but
responding
to
powell's
concerns
in
court
on
tuesday
a
government
lawyer
said
they
were
irrelevant
noting
they
did
not
accuse
flynn
of
being
a
russian
agent
in
the
first
place
the
government
has
not
alleged
in
any
filings
in
this
court
or
before
the
court
that
the
defendant
is
an
agent
of
russia
that
is
not
part
of
this
case
that
is
not
part
of
the
act
that
he
has
pled
guilty
to
it
was
lying
to
the
fbi
about
particular
communications
involving
russia
not
being
an
agent
of
russia
prosecutor
brandon
van
grack
said
according
to
the
transcript
aside
from
powell's
latest
claims
in
court
fox
news
reported
on
monday
that
onetime
deputy
fbi
director
andrew
mccabe
told
the
white
house
in
early
february
that
the
bureau
was
not
considering
flynn
for
a
potential
logan
act
prosecution
over
contacts
with
kislyak
before
donald
trump
was
sworn
in
as
president
mccabe
was
referring
to
the
rarely
prosecuted
year-old
statute
that
bars
american
citizens
from
engaging
with
a
foreign
government
without
authorization
from
the
current
u.s.
government

the
fox

the
records
also
indicated
that
flynn
reported
on
two
separate
occasions
in
the
days
leading
up
to
his
white
house
firing
that
fbi
agents
told
him
the
bureau
investigation
was
over
or
being
closed
out
there
is
far
more
at
stake
here
than
sentencing
powell
said
there
were
stunning
failures
to
produce
brady
material
going
back
to
july
of
