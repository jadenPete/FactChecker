said

that

few
crews
stayed

reviewed
the
vast
majority
of
the
overnight
stays

crews
in

approximately
six
percent
of
those
crews
stayed

the
statement
from
an

official
said
as
a
practice
we
generally
send
aircrews
to
the
closest
most
suitable
accommodations
within
the
government
hotel
rate
the
review
also
indicated

about
percent
of
the
crews
stayed
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
airfield

percent
stayed
in
glasgow

no
evidence
has
emerged
to
show
trump
did
anything
to
alter
the

found
that
the
deal
involved
the
air

as
little
as
a
night

a
typical
rate
of
more
