to
outrage
over
a
resurfaced

she
appeared

said
sunday
she's
controversial
only
because
people
seem
to
want
the
controversy
the
minnesota
democrat's
comments
came
during
an
appearance
on
cbs
news
face
the
nation
with
margaret
brennan
asked
whether
omar
was
indeed
making
that
comparison
in
the
video
omar
said
i'm
only
controversial
because
people
seem
to
want
the
controversy
the
video
shared
by
a
republican
national
committee
twitter
account
saturday
featured
omar
speaking
to
a
group
about
her
recent
trip
to
ghana
she
discussed
visiting
a
year-old
dungeon
where
africans
were
held
captive
and
separated
by
gender
she
said
a
description
of
the
dungeon
by
a
tour
guide
gave
her
flashbacks
to
images
she'd
seen
of
libya
where
a
slave
trade
has
been
ongoing
and
images
she'd
seen
of
migrant
detention
camps
in
the
u.s.
and
so
of
a
story
that
happened
years
ago
i
constantly
had
this
reminder
this
horrifying
image
of
many
of
the
things
that
were
taking
place
there
in
that
dungeon
now
taking
place
whether
it
is
taking
place
in
the
shores
of
north
africa
or
in
the
shores
of
the
united
states
omar's
description
of
tore
my
heart
apart
surviving
son
of
terror
victim
tells
hannity
still
omar
insisted
later
that
she
meant
for
the
two
comparisons
to
be
treated
separately
there
is
always
an
implied
intent
with
every
conversation
i
have
she
said
and
if
you
listen
to
the
video
one
comparison
of
what
the
dungeons
looked
like
and
people
being
sold
was
to
what's
happening
in
north
africa
and
the
other
one
was
of
family
separations

omar
continued
and
of
course
we
obviously
have
a
crisis
here
with
our
family
separation
policies
asked
whether
her
comments
were
a
direct
attack
on
u.s.
border
agents
she
said
absolutely
not
