was
widely
seen
as

writing
in

we
fell
an
inch
short
tonight
but
it
took
more
than
million
in
outside
republican
spending
and
a
last-minute
trump
rally
to
seal
democratic
candidate
dan
mccready's
fate
in
the

mccready's
campaign
spent
approximately
million
on
the
race
while
bishop's
spent
only
million
outside
spending
primarily
from
national

committees
helped
bishop
to
the
tune
of
million
though
compared
to
mccready's
roughly
million
the
clean
sweep
heartened

who
has
long
emphasized
