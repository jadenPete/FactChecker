tuesday
corey
lewandowski's
testimony
in
front
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
tuesday
increases
the
case
for
impeachment
of
president
trump
the
president's
former
campaign
manager
was
the
first
witness
to
be
called
in
the
democratic-led
impeachment
investigation
and
his
nearly
five
hours
of
questioning
was
argumentative
fiery
and
combative
on
both
sides
it
is
now
clear
the
investigation
was
populated
by
many
trump
haters
who
had
their
own
agenda
to
try
and
take
down
a
duly
elected
president
of
the
united
states
lewandowski
said
in
his
opening
statement
as
for
actual
collusion
or
conspiracy
there
was
none
what
there
has
been
however
is
harassment
of
this
president
from
the
day
he
won
the
election
corey
lewandowski
slams
impeachment-probe
hearing
as
all
politics
and
a
disservice
to
the
american
people
still
democrats
are
not
backing
down
in
the
hope
of
making
good
on
their
threat
to
impeach
trump
they
claim
he
obstructed
justice
and
that
his
campaign
colluded
with
russia
during
the
election
the
subject
of
a
nearly
two-year-long
investigation
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
office
that
eventually
ended
in
no
conclusive
charges
against
the
president
we
need
to
hold
people
in
contempt
ocasio-cortez
told
fox
news
before
adding
of
trump
we
need
to
hold
him
accountable
she
also
added
that
members
of
his
administration
and
former
campaign
staff
should
also
face
punishment
singling
out
counselor
to
the
president
kellyanne
conway
in
my
opinion
they
should
be
thrown
in
jail
or
fined
in
a
way
that
would
be
painful
she
said
ocasio-cortez
has
been
outspoken
in
support
of
impeachment
proceedings
despite
the
reluctance
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
who
has
warned
that
a
failed
impeachment
bid
could
potentially
doom
efforts
to
prosecute
trump
after
he
leaves
office
and
overshadow
the
democratic
campaign
efforts
before
the
election
the
white
house
has
pushed
back
against
the
impeachment
inquiry
with
equal
aggression
blocking
oversight
requests
and
declining
to
provide
new
documents
or
allow
former
aides
to
testify
ocasio-cortez
previously
urged
the
house
of
representatives
to
vote
on
impeachment
proceedings
as
a
ploy
to
stain
republicans
once
the
house
impeaches
the
house
has
impeached
the
president
and
then
that
hearing
goes
to
the
senate
she
told
reporters
for
msnbc
last
week
if
they
want
to
fail
it
then
i
want
to
see
every
republican
go
on
the
record
and
knowingly
vote
against
impeachment
of
this
president
knowing
his
corruption
having
it
on
the
record
so
that
they
can
have
that
stain
on
their
careers
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
because
this
is
outrageous
to
protect
the
amount
of
lawlessness

ocasio-cortez
also
told
fox
news
tuesday
that
the
house
is
taking
a
look
at
possible
impeachment
proceedings
against
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
over
allegations
of
sexual
assault
that
have
been
revived
by
a
recent
book
written
by
two
new
york
times
reporters
it
opens
a
very
serious
question
about
how
the
fbi
conducted
the
case
and
opens
up
the
possibility
that
kavanaugh
perjured
himself
ocasio-cortez
said
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
hearings
last
year
