scurrilous
and
cowardlythe
deep
state
tried
to
use
an
illegitimate
tool
to
throw
up
a
smokescreen
to
distract
the

from
president

success
says
former

republicans
in
congress
defended
president
trump
on
friday
after
a
report
said
a
whistleblower
filed
a
complaint
over
an
apparent
july
phone
call
between
the
president
and
the
leader
of
ukraine
blasting
the
allegations
as
highly
partisan
it's
not
like
we
haven't
seen
this
movie
before
u.s.
rep
jim
jordan
r-ohio
told
the
washington
post
democrats
come
out
they're
all
spun
up
adam
schiff
makes
all
kinds
of
statements
and
then
when
the
facts
come
out
whoa
different
story
this
seems
to
be
the
same
kind
of
deal

added
whistleblower
complaint
reportedly
on
trump
promise
to
foreign
leader
touches
off
dc
firestorm
the
complaint
made
by
an
unnamed
intelligence
official
reportedly
involved
trump
asking
ukranian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
investigate
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
for
alleged
wrongdoing
while
the
elder
biden
was
vice
president
u.s.
rep
mark
meadows
r-n
c.
echoed
the
idea
that
such
complaints
hamper
the
president
in
his
work
it
would
have
a
real
chilling
effect
on
dialogue
between
important
leaders
if
they
think
that
every
time
someone
who
overhears
a
conversation
that
wasn't
even
party
to
the
conversation
is
going
to
file
a
whistleblower
complaint
and
it'll
end
up
on
the
front
page
of
periodicals
across
the
country
meadows
said
according
to
the
post
rep
mike
gallagher
r-wis
said
private
phone
calls
with
foreign
leaders
are
part
of
the
president's
job
the
fact
is
the
president
to
quote
john
marshall
is
the
sole
organ
of
u.s.
external
relations
and
has
to
have
conversations
in
confidence
with
foreign
leaders
he
said
there's
no
practical
way
to
conduct
diplomacy
without
it
but
he
added
he's
in
favor
of
transparency
the
administration
is
also
taking
flak
for
not
sharing
the
complaint
with
congress
most
republicans
avoided
commenting
on
the
complaint
and
while
a
few
did
express
concerns
they
were
limited
rep
patrick
toomey
r-pa
said
it
would
be
wildly
inappropriate
for
a
president
to
ask
a
foreign
government
to
get
involved
in
a
u.s.
election
but
added
he
isn't
accusing
trump
of
doing
that
rep
chris
stewart
r-utah
a
member
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
broke
with
republicans
in
saying
some
on
his
side
of
the
aisle
might
join
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
in
subpoenaing
the
president's
phone
records
it's
certainly
on
the
table
he
said
when
i
say
that
i
want
to
protect
congressional
oversight
i
really
mean
that
click
here
to
get
the
fox
news
app
trump
has
denied
any
impropriety
and
in
a
twitter
message
friday
he
called
the
unidentified
whistleblower
highly
partisan

post
