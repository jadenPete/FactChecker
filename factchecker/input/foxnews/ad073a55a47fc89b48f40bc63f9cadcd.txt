gop
rep
unveils
bill
to
implement
dna
testing
at
border
as
officials
warn
of
child
recycling
it
is
horrifying
that
children
are
becoming
victims
of
trafficking
at
our
southern
border
blackburn
said
in
a
statement
by
confirming
a
familial
connection
between
an
alien
and
an
accompanying
minor
we
can
determine
whether
the
child
was
brought
across
the
border
by
an
adult
with
nefarious
intentions
the
current
crisis
at
our
border
is
multifaceted
and
requires
a
holistic
approach
by
tackling
these
problems
piece
by
piece
we
will
get
this
situation
under
control
a
companion
bill
was
introduced
last
month
in
the
house
by
rep
lance
gooden
r-texas
and
comes
amid
growing
concern
from
republicans
and
border
officials
that
rules
limiting
how
long
families
can
be
detained
are
leading
to
child
trafficking
and
a
recurring
catch-and-release
situation
at
the
border
the
flores
court
settlement
limits
how
long
unaccompanied
children
can
be
held
to
days
in
a
court
ruled
that
the
limit
also
applies
to
minors
accompanied
by
adults
last
month
the
trump
administration
announced
it
is
seeking
to
scrap
the
agreement
although
that
is
likely
to
see
a
fierce
legal
challenge
administration
officials
have
criticized
flores
as
an
immigration
loophole
that
helps
draw
migrant
families
from
central
america
as
well
as
adults
who
bring
children
with
them
in
order
to
have
a
better
chance
of
being
released
in
the
united
states
ernst
said
that
she
had
heard
directly
from
border
agents
that
children
are
being
trafficked
across
the
border
by
those
coming
over
illegally
these
children
are
being
used
as
a
passport
to
get
across
our
border
and
this
needs
to
stop
she
said
one
way
to
address
this
problem
is
by
having
dna
testing
in
place
so
we
can
ensure
that
an
unaccompanied
minor
is
actually
connected
with
the
person
claiming
to
be
their
family
and
not
being
used
as
an
innocent
pawn
to
skirt
our
immigration
laws
both
the
house
and
senate
bills
require
deportation
for
any
adults
who
refuse
a
dna
test
and
sets
a
maximum
year
prison
sentence
for
anyone
fraudulently
claiming
ties
to
a
minor
the
bill
also
criminalizes
child
recycling
in
which
a
child
is
repeatedly
used
by
unrelated
migrants
to
gain
entry
to
the
u.s.
tests
would
consist
of
mouth
swabs
similar
to
those
already
in
use
by
the
state
department
the
agency
says
such
tests
are
percent
accurate
the
bill
will
likely
face
better
prospects
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
than
in
the
house
where
the
democratric
majority
has
increasingly
shifted
to
the
left
on
the
question
of
enforcement
against
illegal
immigrants
