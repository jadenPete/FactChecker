building
the
wall
was
a
key
promise
during
trump's
presidential
campaign
but
he
has
struggled
to
secure
congressional
support
for
the
project
a
problem
made
worse
for
him
when
democrats
took
control
of
the
house
after
the
midterm
elections
now
the
president
appears
intent
on
preventing
his

challenger
from
framing
the
issue

an
unfulfilled

that
the

is
not
about

said
it's

the

on

also
issued

spoke
to
the

and
said
tall
border
fencing
is
crucial
in
some
areas
and
less
helpful
in
others
like
remote
stretches
of
desert
where
shorter
barriers
and
more
technology
like
ground
sensors
would
suffice
he
said
building
to
miles
of
fence
by
the
end
of
next
year
would
be
tough
if
that
figure
doesn't
include

have
been
built
