swearing
dems
turn
presidential
campaign
into
r-rated
affair
swearing
becomes
the
new
normal
on
campaign
trail
for
demscrude
language
is
becoming
a
mainstay
on
the
campaign
trail
candidates
aren't
calling
each
other
on
it
and
voters
say
it
won't
affect
their
vote
but
experts
say
this
is
a
new
political
reality
austin
texas
beto
o'rourke
did
not
mince
words
talking
about
gun
violence
at
a
recent
campaign
stop
in
the
boston
neighborhood
of
roxbury
when
a
supporter
shouted
this
is
f-
ed
up
o'rourke
swiftly
echoed
the
sentiment
this
is
f-
ked
up
he
affirmed
that
is
the
term
of
art
for
it
beto
claims
living
close
to
work
is
a
right
the
phrase
virtually
has
become
a
beto
campaign
rallying
cry
on
the
subject
in
the
same
vein
as
the
trump
campaign's
build
the
wall
or
the
traditional
four
more
years
his
team
is
even
selling
shirts
emblazoned
with
the
slogan
the
salty
language
is
hardly
unique
to
o'rourke
perhaps
egged
on
by
each
other
or
by
the
vitriolic
political
environment
as
a
whole
or
responding
in
kind
to
president
trump's
language
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
this
year
are
swearing
with
wild
abandon
unclear
is
whether
this
is
an
attention-grabbing
fad
or
now
a
permanent
feature
of
an
american
presidential
race
i
just
tried
to
speak
as
honestly
as
i
can
o'rourke
explained
and
the
language
that
my
fellow
americans
use
when
they're
talking
about
the
issues
that
are
most
important
to
them
last
month
rep
tim
ryan
d-ohio
was
equally
coarse
speaking
at
the
democratic
party's
summer
meeting
in
san
francisco
he
called
out
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
for
not
moving
on
gun
control
legislation
in
the
wake
of
the
deadly
el
paso
and
dayton
mass
shootings
mitch
mcconnell
get
off
your
ass
and
pass
the
gun
reform
legislation
in
the
united
states
senate
ryan
shouted
to
the
crowd
to
rapturous
applause
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
has
boasted
that
he
wrote
the
damn
legislation
referring
to
medicare
for
all
and
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
recently
lamented
we
are
not
going
to
give
thoughts
and
prayers
which
to
me
is
just
bulls-
talking
about
gun
violence
some
political
scientists
think
trump
opened
the
floodgates
for
this
kind
of
rhetoric
back
in
swearing
several
times
at
his
campaign
rallies
it's
intended
to
be
jarring
i
think
part
of
the
point
of
doing
it
is
that
it's
supposed
to
be
alarmist
and
it's
supposed
to
be
an
awakening
the
candidates
are
trying
to
get
your
attention
and
it
often
works
said
university
of
houston
political
science
professor
brandon
rottinghaus
but
rottinghaus
said
this
is
a
new
political
world
we
went
from
the
politics
of
it
being
pg
to
it
being
pg-
to
sometimes
r-rated
so
far
there
hasn't
been
much
pushback
to
elevate
campaign
speech
from
the
other
candidates
the
you-do-you
advice
seems
to
be
the
most
common
response
i
swore
on
comedy
central
this
week
you
know
look
people
should
be
whoever
they
are
montana
gov
steve
bullock
said
everybody's
gonna
do
what
they're
comfortable
with
and
what
they
believe
they
need
to
do
i
can't
say
that
i've
never
used
a
swear
word
said
julian
castro
former
housing
secretary
but
one
entity
that
might
not
be
comfortable
with
it
is
the
federal
communications
commission
with
the
upcoming
thursday
night
debate
in
houston
network
news
organizations
like
host
abc
and
even
the
dnc
are
cautioning
about
foul
language
o'rourke
calls
for
red
flag
laws
an
email
from
the
dnc
sent
to
the
campaigns
on
behalf
of
abc
advised
we
will
not
be
broadcasting
on
any
delay
so
there
will
be
no
opportunity
to
edit
out
foul
language
some
voters
are
bristling
at
the
language
is
this
really
what
you
want
the
kids
to
do
you
have
to
be
above
what
the
norm
is
and
cursing
is
just
you
can
have
other
words
said
sarah
rousso
a
texas
voter
but
for
some
it
simply
reflects
the
way
a
lot
of
people
talk

it's

talking
to
someone
you
already
know
or
hearing
from
someone

already
