house
has
instructed
two
former
aides
to
president
trump
not
to
appear
at
a
house
judiciary
committee
hearing

saying
rick
dearborn
and
rob
porter
are
absolutely
immune
from
testifying
at
what
the
panel
is
calling
its
first
impeachment
hearing
in
a
letter
sent
to
the
panel
and
obtained
by
the
associated
press
white
house
counsel
pat
cipollone
wrote
that
the
justice
department
has
advised
and
trump
has
directed
dearborn
and
porter
to
defy
subpoenas
because
of
constitutional
immunity
lawyers
for
both
men
said
they
would
follow
trump's
orders
former

campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
who
never
worked

the
white
house
is
expected
to
attend
the
hearing
as
its
sole
witness
on

in
a
separate
letter
cipollone
said
lewandowski
should
not
reveal
private
conversations
with

what
is

house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
invited
the
three
men
to
testify
at
the
hearing
as
part
of
the
panel's
probe
into
mueller's
report
and
what
nadler
is
calling
an
aggressive
series
of
hearings
this
fall
to
determine
whether
trump
should
be
impeached
but
the
committee
has
so
far
been
hobbled
by
the
white
house's
blockade
of
witness
testimony
and
document
requests
and
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
said
she
wants
to
wait
to
see
what
happens
in
court
before
making
a
decision
on
impeachment
cipollone
wrote
that
dearborn
and
porter
were
advised
not
to
attend
because
of
the
constitutional
immunity
that
protects
senior
advisers
to
the
president
from
compelled
congressional
testimony
and
in
order
to
protect
the
prerogatives
of
the
office
of
president
democrats
are
challenging
such
claims
of
absolute
immunity
in
a
lawsuit
against
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
who
defied
a
subpoena
earlier
this
year
on
trump's
orders
they
say
that
such
a
claim
does
not
legally
exist
in
the
letter
regarding
lewandowski
cipollone
wrote
nadler
that
his
conversations
with
trump
are
protected
from
disclosure
by
long-settled
principles
protecting
executive
branch
confidentiality
interests
in
a
statement
nadler
said
the
white
house's
position
is
a
shocking
and
dangerous
assertion

the

porter's
lawyer
said
in
another
letter
to
nadler
that
his
client
was
trapped
between
competing
and
incompatible
demands
from
coordinate
and
coequal
branches
and
would
for
now
defy
the
subpoena
he
indicated
that
porter
would
testify
if
he
was
instructed
to
do
so
by
the
courts
such
conflicting
demands
must
be
resolved
through
an
accommodation
between
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
or
by
the
judiciary
bishop
wrote
in
the
meantime
because
the
inquiry
at
issue
relates
to
his
service
as
a
senior
official
at
the
white
house
mr
porter
must
respect
the
white
house's
instruction
at
the
hearing
on
tuesday
lewandowski
would
be
free
to
discuss
trump's
campaign
which
he
worked
on
until
he
was
fired
in
the
summer
of
but
the
judiciary
panel
is
most
interested
in
mueller's
report
and
whether
trump
obstructed
justice
the
report
said
the
president
could
not
be
exonerated
on
that
point
according
to
the
report
trump
asked
lewandowski
twice
to
ask
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
limit
mueller's
investigation
trump
said
that
if
sessions
would
not
meet
with
lewandowski
then
lewandowski
should
tell
sessions
he
was
fired

lewandowski
never
delivered
the
message
but
asked
dearborn
a
former
sessions
aide
to
do
it
dearborn
said
he
was
uncomfortable
with
the
request
and
also
declined
to
deliver
it
according
to
the
report
porter
a
former
staff
secretary
in
the
white
house
took
frequent
notes
during

time
