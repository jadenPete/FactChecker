on

to

choosing

about

than

primary
the
democratic
primary
in
illinois
third
district
bears
a
resemblance
to
ocasio-cortez's
run
in
after
defeating
a
powerful
democratic
incumbent
in
queens
ocasio-cortez
became
a
symbol
for
progressive
newcomers
attempting
to
challenge
the
party's
establishment
lipinski
who
beat
newman
in
is
one
of
the
few
pro-life
democrats
in
congress
and
previously
voted
against
former
president
obama's
affordable
care
act
a
landmark
law
that
democrats
have
criticized
for
not
going
far
enough
in
reforming
health
care
in
an
interview
with
the
new
york
times
ocasio-cortez
said
it
was
problematic
that
he
continued
holding
the
seat
in
a
deep
blue
district
the
fact
that
a
deep
blue
seat
is
advocating
for
many
parts
of
the
republican
agenda
is
extremely
problematic
we're
not
talking
about
a
swing
state
that
is
being
forced
to
take
tough
votes
she
said
newman
also
has
received
endorsements
from
sens
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
elizabeth

progressives

queens
candidate
testing
her
political
influence
on
new

lipinski
who
has
pushed
for
more
conservative
voices
in
the
party
portrayed
the
endorsement
as
confirmation
that
newman
was
an
extreme
candidate
alexandria
ocasio-cortez's
endorsement
of
marie
newman
makes
crystal
clear
that
ms
newman
is
an
extreme
candidate
who
is
completely
out
of
step
with
the
voters
of
illinois
third
district
who
do
not
want
to
be
represented
by
a
fifth
member
of
the
squad
lipinski
said
he
pointed
to
newman's
support
for
medicare-for-all
and
the
green
new
deal
as
policies
that
would
raise
costs
for
the
average
american
in
addition
million
jobs
would
be
lost
through
this
unrealistic
policy
that
has
been
attacked
vociferously
by
the
labor
unions
ms
newman
claims
to
support
ocasio-cortez
responded
by
suggesting
lipinski
was
divisive
this
is
a
real
quote
from
a
democrat
representing
a
safe
blue
seat
she
tweeted
aggressive
statements
like
these
are
so
casually
thrown
from
corporate
candidates
towards
grassroots
ones
yet
they
never
get
branded
as
divisive
despite
their
rhetoric
we
should
ask
ourselves
why
that
