cory

is
warning
in
a
memo
to

that
the
democratic
senator
from
new
jersey
must
raise
an
additional
million
by
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
of
fundraising
just
days
away
or
the

will
not

a
legitimate
long-term
path
forward

campaign
manager

demissie
warned
that
following
a
weaker
than
expected
cash
haul
during
the
early
part
of
september
the
next
days
will
determine
whether
cory
booker
can
stay
in
this
race
booker
voices
concerns
over
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
the
existence
of
the
memo
was
first
reported
saturday
morning
by
nbc
news
with
fox
news
confirming
the
news
with
multiple
sources
two
sources
who
asked
to
remain
anonymous
to
speak
more
freely
said
it
was
no
accident
that
the
memo
was
leaked
and
described
it
as
an
effort
to
spark
a
surge
in
fundraising
over
the
next
days
and
a
campaign
memo
sent
to
political
reporters
saturday
morning
said
this
isn't
an
end-of-quarter
stunt
or
another
one
of
those
memos
from
a
campaign
trying
to
spin
the
press
this
is
a
real
unvarnished
look
under
the
hood
of
our
operation
at
a
level
of
transparency
unprecedented
in
modern
presidential
campaigns
booker
who
declared
his
candidacy
for
the
white
house
in
early
february
quickly
built
a
formidable
operation

voting

and
caucus
states
the
large
staff
on
the
ground
in
iowa
new
hampshire
and
other
early

states
is
expensive
to
maintain
demissie
warned
that
while
the
campaign
can
continue
at
its
current
size
and
strength
it
needs
more
funding
if
it
wants
to
expand
where
booker
stands
in
the
latest
fox
news
poll
demissie
explained
in
his
memo
if
our
campaign
is
not
in
a
financial
position
to
grow
he's
not
going
to
continue
to
consume
resources
and
attention
that
can
be
used
to
focus
on
beating
donald
trump
which
needs
to
be
everyone's
first
priority
while
booker
qualified
for
the
third
and
fourth
round

presidential
primary
debates
he's
struggled
