the
fear
confusion
and
sadness
so
many
felt
firsthand
on
september
they
made
the
decision
we
didn't
have
to
make
those
are
the
words
of
lt
col
marc
sasseville
as
recalled
years
later
in
a
new
account
of
the
sept
attacks
from
the
perspective
of
decision-makers
in
washington
survivors
military
service
members
and
the
families
of
those
aboard
united
flight
which
was
hijacked
before
passengers
fought
back
and
brought
the
plane
down
sasseville
an
f-
air
force
pilot
who
along
with
lt
heather
lucky
penney
was
tasked
with
stopping
flight
by
any
means
necessary
from
being
weaponized
like
the
jets
at
the
world
trade
center
and
pentagon
that
morning
lauded
the
brave
passengers
for
doing
exactly
that
sacrificing
themselves
to
foil
the
terrorists
operation
gratitude

thousands
of

but
the
new
book
the
only
plane
in
the
sky
an
oral
history
of
by
garrett
m.
graff
details
the
harrowing
moments
before
it
all
ended
top
bush
administration
officials
scrambled
to
respond
from
a
bunker
then-vice
president
dick
cheney
planned
for
the
possibility
of
bringing
down
flight
as
for
sasseville
and
penney
they
were
looking
at
a
suicide
mission
investigators
comb
the
debris
field
for
evidence
from
united
airlines
flight
near
shanksville
pennsylvania
on
sept
reuters
tim
shaffer
because
they
had
no
missiles
any
operation
to
take
out
flight
would
put
their
lives
on
the
line
too
we
would
be
ramming
the
aircraft
we
didn't
have
missiles
on
board
to
shoot
the
airplane
down
penney
said
as
we
were
putting
on
our
flight
gear
in
the
life
support
shop
sass
looked
at
me
and
said
i'll
ram
the
cockpit
i
made
the
decision
i
would
take
the
tail
off
the
aircraft
this
would
be
a
last
resort
if
they
could
not
otherwise
divert
the
aircraft
at
the
time
sasseville
said
he
was
going
into
this
moral
or
ethical
justification
of
the
needs
of
the
many
versus
the
needs
of
the
few
it
was
a
suicide
mission
but
they
were
ready
to
do
it
if
needed
i
genuinely
believed
that
was
going
to
be
the
last
time
i
took
off
penney
said
if
we
did
it
right
this
would
be
it
excerpts
of
the
book
now
released
were
first
published
by
politico
the
permission
to
carry
out
an
operation
that
would
normally
be
unheard
of
taking
down
a
commercial
flight
killing
passengers
in
the
process
came
from
cheney
who
was
planning
a
course
of
action
from
a
bunker
underneath
the
white
house
the
vice
president
discussed
it
with
president
george
w.
bush
who
agreed
to
the
course
of
action
bush
was
aboard
air
force
one
because
washinton
d.c.
was
deemed
too
dangerous
and
he
was
mostly
cut
off
from
the
ground
due
to
the
lack
of
in-flight
internet
access
in
senior
adviser
karl
rove
who
was
with
bush
at
the
time
witnessed
the
phone
conversation
between
the
president
and
vice
president
he
turned
to
us
and
said
that
he
had
just
authorized
the
shoot-down
of
hijacked
airliners
rove
recalled
cheney
said
the
decision
to
bring
down
united
flight
wasn't
a
close
call
after
he
watched
the
twin
towers
fall
and
the
pentagon
had
been
hit
it
had
to
be
done
once
the
plane
became
hijacked
even
if
it
had
a
load
of
passengers
on
board
who
obviously
weren't
part
of
any
hijacking
attempt
having
seen
what
had
happened
in
new
york
and
the
pentagon
you
really
didn't
have
any
choice
before
it
got
to
that
point
cheney
then-national
security
adviser
condoleezza
rice
and
others
began
their
day
as
usual
everything
changed
after
the
second
plane
hit
the
world
trade
center
they
understood
that
the
first
strike
was
no
accident
and
that
the
u.s.
was
under
attack
then
radar
found
another
plane
heading
toward
washington
and
they
were
swiftly
whisked
out
of
the
white
house
by
the
secret
service
to
the
hidden
bunker
i
remember
being
driven
along
almost
propelled
along
rice
recalled
we
had
no
idea
where
it
was
safe
and
where
it
wasn't
we
didn't
think
the
bunker
of
the
white
house
was
safe
at
that
point
a
few
moments
later
cheney
said
i
found
myself
in
a
fortified
white
house
command
post
somewhere
down
below
the
bunker
which
had
been
build
as
a
cold
war
bomb

never
been
needed

with

one
cheney
found
himself
in
charge
of
the
situation
on
the
ground
his
background
prepared
him
for
the
worst
as
bad
as
the
events
of
were
some
of
us
had
practiced
exercises
for
far
more
dangerous
and
difficult
circumstances
an
all-out
soviet

attack
on
the
united
states
he
recalled
that
helped
that
training
kicked
in
that
morning
when
united
was
tracked
as
heading
toward
washington
d.c.
he
was
prepared
to
give
the
order
to
bring
it
down
it
ended
up
being
unnecessary
as
the
passengers
took
matters
into
their
own
hands
the
men
and
women
on
that
flight
had
learned
about
what
had
already
happened
at
the
world
trade
center
and
pentagon
and
were
determined
to
fight
back
in
order
to
prevent
a
similar
attack

while
he
was
in

she
said
she
pleaded
with
him
not
to
do
anything
to
endanger
himself
but
he
insisted
if
they're
going
to
crash
this
plane
we're
going
to
have
to
do
something

screaming
she
said
beamer's

was
pregnant
with
their
third
child
at
the
time
but
when
jefferson
offered
to
connect
him
to
her
he
declined
so
as
not
to
upset
her
instead
jefferson
said
he
gave
her
his
home
phone

and
asked
jefferson
to
call
his
wife

to
him
jefferson
then

beamer
ask
someone
else

in
the
