behavior
prevented

she
told

monroe
condemned
those

it's

believe
it's
ok
to
harass
businesses
because
of
their
customers
political

about
this
but

don't
consider
that
threatening
she
argued
i'm
doing
my
due
diligence

railroad
company
released

statement
after
the
event
was
canceled

byrne
claimed
that
the
ride
would
not
have
posed
legal

space
or
facilities
to
political
groups
without
jeopardizing
their
status
