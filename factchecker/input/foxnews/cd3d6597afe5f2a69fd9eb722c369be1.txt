democratic
presidential
candidate
bernie
sanders
released
a
plan
saturday
to
eliminate
billion
in
past-due
medical
debt
going
a
step
beyond
his
primary
rivals
who
have
called
for
a
government-run
health
insurance
program
in
america
today
it
is
unacceptable
that
one
out
of
every
six
americans
have
past-due
medical
bills
on
their
credit
report
totaling
billion
sen
sanders
i-vt
said
in
a
statement
adding
it
is
immoral
and
unconscionable
that
families
across
the
country
are
being
evicted
having
their
heat
disconnected
or
having
their
already-inadequate
wages
garnished
because
of
crippling
medical
debt
while
the
health
care
industry
made
more
than
billion
in
profits
last
year
supreme
court
could
hear
groundbreaking
case
that
challenges
un
immunity
under
his
plan
sanders
said
the
federal
government
would
step
in
for
the
individual
to
negotiate
and
pay
off
past-due
medical
bills
in
collections
reported
to
credit
agencies
sanders
also
vowed
to
create
a
public
credit
registry
to
replace
the
three
for-profit
credit
reporting
agencies
in
order
to
as
he
put
it
remove
the
profit
motive
from
assessing
the
creditworthiness
of
american
consumers
he
said
the
registry
would
use
public
transparent
algorithm
to
determine
creditworthiness
that
eliminates
racial
biases
in
credit
scores
the
self-described
democratic
socialist
added
that
he
would
exclude
medical
debt
from
credit
reports
and
end
credit
checking
for
rental
housing
employment
insurance
and
other
non-lending
practices

like

sanders
made
no
mention
in
the
proposal
of
how
he
planned
to
cover
the
billion
cost
according
to
reuters
the
sanders
campaign
has
said
they
would
pay
for
the
debt
elimination
proposal
through
a
tax
on
corporations
based
on
their
pay
for
chief
executives
the
details
of
that
proposal
have
not
been
released
during
an
interview
with
fox
news
sept
sanders
acknowledged
that
billion
is
a
lot
of
money
but
he
added
compared
to
what
compared
to
the
trillion
that
trump
gave
in
tax
breaks
to
the
one
percent
and
large
corporations
compared
to
the
billions
of
dollars
that
we
spent
bailing
out
the
crooks
on
wall
street
years
ago
it
is
a
lot
of
money
but
i
think
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
sanders
was
one
of
the
earliest
supporters
of
medicare-for-all
which
would
replace
job-based
and
individual
health
insurance
with
a
government-run
plan
other
top
democratic
rivals
have
expressed
interest
in
a
toned-down
version
of
medicare-for-all
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
has
endorsed
sanders
plan
but
said
there
may
be
different
ways
to
achieve
coverage
for
all
former
vice
president
joe
biden
has
called
to
extend
the
affordable
care
act
by
adding
a
public
option
sanders
has
also
released
a
plan
to
eliminate
trillion
in
student
loan
debt

also
making

where
he
draws
the
line
in
wiping
out
debt
sanders
in
his
sept
interview
said
there's
a
difference
between
wiping
out
medical
debt
and
credit
card
debt
i
don't
believe
we
wipe
out
credit
card
debt
you
want
something
you
pay
for
it
he
said
if
you
want
to
go
out
and
buy
a
fancy
house
you
want
to
go
out
and
buy
a
yacht
and
you
go
in
debt
hey
that's
your
decision
but
i
do
believe
we
have
to
make
a
distinction
getting
cancer
is
not
your
decision
and
i
think
we
have
a
moral
obligation
to
do
everything
we
can
to
cancel
that
debt
