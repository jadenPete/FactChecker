an
advocate
for
u.s.
intervention
abroad

fevered
speculation
over
john
bolton's
replacement
as
national
security
adviser
tensions
between
bolton
and
white
house
staffers
flared
in
recent
months
over
influence
in
the
president's
orbit
and
how
to
manage
his
desire
to
negotiate
with
some
of
the
world's
most
unsavory
actors
since
joining
the
administration
in
the
spring
of
last
year
bolton
has
espoused
skepticism
about
the
president's
whirlwind
rapprochement
with
north
korea
and
recently
has
become
a
vocal
internal
critic
of
potential
talks
between
trump

leaders
of
iran
and
afghanistan's
taliban
we
were
set
back
very
badly
when
john
bolton
talked
about
the
libyan
model
trump
said
of
bolton's
push
to
deal
with
north
korea
in
the
same
way
the
u.s.
dealt
with
libya
under
former
strongman
muammar
qaddafi
the
libyan
leader
forfeited
major
weapons
and
allowed
inspectors
into
his
country
only
to
complain
the
west
didn't
give
him
much
in
return
he
was
eventually
ousted
and
killed
during
the
arab
spring
uprisings
that
were
supported
by
europe
and
the
u.s.

i
don't
consider
it
a
question
of
being
tough
trump
added
of
bolton's
proposed
approach
that's
a
question
of
being
not
smart
bolton
also
broke
with
trump
with
his
vocal
condemnation
of
russia's
global
aggressions
and
last
year
he
masterminded
a
quiet
campaign
inside
the
administration
and
with
allies
abroad
to
persuade
trump
to
keep
u.s.
forces
in
syria
to
counter
the
remnants
of
the
islamic
state
and
iranian
influence
in
the
