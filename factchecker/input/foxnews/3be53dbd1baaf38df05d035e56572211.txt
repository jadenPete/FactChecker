to
be
personal
for

who
received
early
support
from
markey
for
her
ambitious
proposals
to
address
the
specter
of
climate
change
when
i
first
got
to
congress
and
we
started
to
discuss
big
bold
plans
a
solution
on
the
scale
of
the

shied
away

too
much
we
can't
go
too
fast
in
order
to
pursue
change
for
the
american
people

added
and
ed

was
one
of
the
few
people
that
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
take
a
chance
and
take
a
chance
on
a
freshman
congresswoman
aoc
says
she's
woken
up
at
a.m.

of
her
anxiety
about
climate
change
markey
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
a
resolution
pushing
the

deal
in
the
senate
the
massachusetts
senator
also
pushed
cap-and-trade
legislation
early

president
obama's
administration
ocasio-cortez's
plan
has
come
to
symbolize
progressives
aggressive
agenda
on
the
environment
she
has
faced
pushback
from
members
of
her
own
party
like
sen
dianne
feinstein
d-calif
as
well
as
sweeping
attacks
from
republicans
who
dubbed
her
a
socialist

estimated
the
plan
would
cost
trillions
of
dollars
and
inflict
a
heavy
financial
toll
on

seemed
to
fit
with

deal

said
that
markey's
willingness
to
take
a
chance
on

plan
was
so
emblematic
of

was

not
just
resting
on
his
record
of
the
past
he's
aggressively
pursuing
an
agenda
for
