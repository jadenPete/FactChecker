issa's
confirmation
hearing
for
a
top
trade
position
in
the
trump
administration
was
indefinitely
delayed
thursday
after
senate
foreign
relations
committee
ranking
member
bob
menendez
insisted
on
the
release
of
an
fbi
background
file
that
sources
say
shows
issa
used
a
fake
id
when
he
was
issa
the
colorful
former
chairman
of
the
house
oversight
committee
was
nominated
a
year
ago
to
be
director
of
the
u.s.
trade
and
development
agency
with
the
confirmation
process
at
a
crawl
he's
already
signaled
he's
ready
to
move
on
creating
an
exploratory
committee
for
a
potential
run
against
embattled
rep
duncan

r-calif
issa
launches
exploratory
committee
asked
thursday
about
the
latest
delay
issa
told
fox
news
my
desire
is
to
serve
the
president
and
help
in
any
way
i
can
if
it
becomes
my
best
course
to
take
a
congressional
seat
and
help
take
back
the
majority
in
the
house
that's
ok
too
the
focus
on
the
fake
id
he
used
as
a
year-old
army
private
raised
eyebrows
considering
issa
had
a
well-known
history
of
run-ins
with
the
law
when
he
was
a
teenager
involving
more
serious
accusations
but
during
the
confirmation
hearing
on
thursday
menendez
d-n
j.
argued
that
the
committee
did
not
have
access
to
the
information
needed
to
determine
whether
issa
could
be
confirmed
to
his
post
and
said
there
was
problematic
information
from
his
fbi
background
investigation
that
could
be
potentially
disqualifying
an
official
familiar
with
the
situation
told
fox
news
that
menendez
issa
and
committee
chairman
jim
risch
r-idaho
met
on
the
sidelines
of
the
hearing
to
discuss
the
file
which
also
includes
issa's
other
legal
run-ins
the
official
told
fox
news
that
the
specific
issue
menendez
was
citing
was
a
falsified
military
id
card
that
issa
used
when
he
was
a
year-old
private
according
to
the
official
in
the
early
s
when
issa
was
stationed
near
pittsburgh
he
had
a
military
id
that
said
he
was
two
years
older
the
official
said
issa
at
the
time
was
disciplined
by
the
lieutenant
in
charge
who
was
not
amused
it
was
a
military
id
where
the
id
office
had
put
the
wrong
birthday
on
which
made
issa
look
older
the
official
said
the
official
said
the
id
was
completely
authentic
and
legitimately
issued
but
someone
did
a
little
maneuver
in
the
id
office
to
help
issa
to
go
into
bars
according
to
the
official
the
army
at
the
time
always
observed
for
drinking
a
beer
on
base
issa
was
from
ohio
where
the
drinking
age
was
for
percent
beer
at
the
time
but
in
pittsburgh
the
legal
drinking
age
was
on
the
sidelines
of
the
hearing
menendez
pressed
issa
according
to
the
official
he
said
if
you
would
falsify
records
when
you
were
how
can
we
believe
you're
credible
to
be
honest
now
representatives
for
risch
and
menendez
did
not
comment
for
this
report
issa
has
a
record
of
criminal
cases
against
him
as
a
teenager
including
arrests
in
the
early
s
twice
on
unregistered
firearm
charges
and
twice
on
grand
theft
auto
charges
though
prosecutors
ultimately
dropped
those
charges
the
whole
issue
involving
mr
issa's
fbi
background
check
revolves
around
when
he
was
caught
using
a
fake
id
as
a
year-old
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
confirmation
hearing
proceedings
told
fox
news
it's
ridiculous
that
an
embattled
elected
official
like
senator
menendez
is
holding
up
mr
issa's
confirmation
for
something
so
petty
the
source
added
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
see
in
mr
issa's
file
that
hasn't
been
litigated
before
the
official
told
fox
news
that
issa
had
been
granted
security
clearances
long
after
the
offenses
in
the
s
issa
was
granted
clearances
while
serving
in
the
u.s.
army
and
as
a
member
of
the
house
permanent
select
committee
on
intelligence
menendez
has
had
well-publicized
legal
battles
of
his
own
federal
prosecutors
pursued
a
major
bribery
and
corruption
case
against
him
over
favors
for
and
from
a
florida
ophthalmologist
and
friend
of
the
senator
but
a
mistrial
was
declared
in
after
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
and
federal
prosecutors
later
said
they
would
not
retry
him
from
the
very
beginning
i
never
wavered
in
my
innocence
and
my
belief
that
justice
would
prevail
