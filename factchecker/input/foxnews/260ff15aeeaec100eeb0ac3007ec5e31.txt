on
how
sen
bernie
sanders
will
fund
his
new
housing
plan
democratic
presidential
candidate
sen
bernie
sanders
says
he
wants
to
spend
a
whopping
trillion
over
a
decade
to
guarantee
all
americans
regardless
of
income
safe
and
affordable
housing
in
formally
unveiling
his
housing
for
all
plan
on
wednesday
the
progressive
senator
from
vermont
who's
making
his
second
straight
bid
for
the
white
house
said
there's
a
shortage
of
million
affordable
homes
for
the
lowest-income
renters
and
he
stressed
that
more
than
million
families
across
the
country
are
paying
more
than
half
of
their
limited
incomes
on
housing
and
utilities

staff
shakeup
in
crucial
first-primary
state
of
new
hampshire
there
is
virtually
no
place
in
america
where
a
full-time
minimum-wage
worker
can
afford
a
decent
two-bedroom
apartment
sanders
said
in
a
statement
at
a
time
when
half
of
our
people
are
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
this
is
unacceptable
he
emphasized
that
for
too
long
the
federal
government
has
ignored
the
extraordinary
housing
crisis
in
our
country
that
will
end
when
i
am
president
my
administration
will
be
looking
out
for
working
families
and
tenants
not
the
billionaires
who
control
wall
street
sanders
says
he'll
fully
pay
for
the
plan
by
establishing
a
wealth
tax
on
the
top
one-tenth
of
one
percent
of
americans
sanders
touts
that
percent
of
americans
will
not
see
their
taxes
go
up
by
one
nickel
as
a
result
of
his
housing
plan
it's
the
latest
in
a
series
of
expensive
proposals
that
democrats
say
would
be
funded
through
higher
taxes
for
the
wealthy
and
other
measures
but
have
stirred
debate
in
the
presidential
primary
other
such
proposals
include
medicare-for-all
the
green
new
deal
free
college
tuition
and
medical
debt
cancellation
sanders
answer
is
always
a
massive
spending
program
that
will
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
and
increase
government
control
over
the
lives
of
millions
of
americans

wednesday
a
spokesman
for

trump's
re-election
campaign
daniel
bucheli
called
it
yet
another
pie-in-the-sky
big
government
socialist
promise
by
the
bernie
camp
in
teasing
his
proposal
during
a
speech
saturday
in
las
vegas
the
senator
acknowledged
that
the
trillion
price
tag
was
expensive
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
the
other
top-tier
progressive
candidate
in
the
record-setting
field
in
the
race
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
has
also
proposed
upping
taxes
on
the
ultra-wealthy
among
other
things
sanders
proposal
calls
for
building
nearly
million
homes
through
the
national
affordable
housing
trust
fund
social
housing
community
land
trusts
and
other
housing
programs
he
would
also
fully
fund
the
section
rental
assistance
program
enact
a
cap
on
annual
rent
increases
at
no
more
than
percent
or
one
and
a
half
times
the
consumer
price
index
which
ever
is
higher
and
he
would
establish
anti-discrimination
protections
for
those
receiving
assistance
against
their
landlords
sanders
says
through
his
plan
he'll
rehabilitate
and
preserve
million
housing
units
to
eliminate
the
affordable
housing
gap
and
build
million
mixed-income
social
housing
units
the
senator
also
took
aim
at
president
trump
arguing
that
instead
of
expanding
federal
housing
programs
trump
wants
to
cut
them
by
billion
or
percent
instead
of
working
to
substantially
reduce
the
outrageously
high
price
of
housing
trump
has
proposed
tripling
what
some
of
the
poorest
senior
citizens
and
people
with
disabilities
in
america
are
paying
for
rent
today
he
added
sanders
also
criticized
the
republican
president
for
proposing
to
eliminate
the
national
housing
trust
fund
