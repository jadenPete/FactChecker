congressional
office
to
demonstrate
support
for
making
the

the
comments
came
during
a
house
oversight
and
reform
committee
hearing
on
a
longshot
democratic

resistance
from
republicans-

longshot
bid
for
dc
statehood
at
rare
hearing
as
republicans
hammer
local
corruption
bowser
replied
yes
got
it
the
mayor
explained
the
reasoning
for
the
flag
we
revere
our
flag
she
said
and
we
think
it's
more
perfect
when
every
taxpaying
american
is
represented
on
that
flag
the
d.c.
statehood
bill
has
more
than
co-sponsors
and
the
support
of

both
democrats
no

avenue
as
washington
d.c.
seeks
statehood
the
bill
calls
for
districtwide
elections
of
two
senators
and
one
house
representative
it
says
all
district
territory
would
be
included
in
the
new
state
save
for
specific
exclusions
of
federal
buildings
and
monuments
such
as
the
white
house
and
the
capitol
democrats
argued
statehood
is
needed
because
d.c.
residents
lack
adequate
representation
in
congress
republicans
said
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
for
the
nation's
capital
to
be
a
federal
district
