told

that

had
a
target
on
his
back
because
of
the
justice
department
inspector
general
findings
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
fired
mccabe
in
march
after
the
inspector
general
found
he
had
repeatedly
misstated
his
involvement
in
a
leak
to
the
wall
street
journal
regarding
an
fbi
investigation
into
the
clinton
foundation
the
ig
report
faulted
mccabe
for
leaking
information
to
then-wall
street
journal
reporter
devlin
barrett
for
an
oct
story
titled
fbi
in
internal
feud
over
hillary
clinton
probe
the
story
written
just
days
before
the
presidential
election
focused
on
the
fbi
announcing
the
reopening
of
the
clinton
investigation
after
finding
thousands
of
her
emails
on
a
laptop
belonging
to
former
democratic
rep
anthony
weiner
who
was
married
to
clinton
aide
huma
abedin
the
journal's
account
of
the
call
said
a
senior
justice
department
official
expressed
displeasure
to
mccabe
that
fbi
agents
were
still
looking
into
the
clinton
foundation
and
that
mccabe
had
defended
the
agent's
authority
to
pursue
the
issue
that
leak
confirmed
the
existence
of
the
probe
the
report
said
which
comey
had
up
to
that
point
refused
to
do
the
report
said
that
mccabe
lacked
candor
in
a
conversation
with
comey
when
he
said
he
had
not
authorized
the
disclosure
and
didn't
know
who
had
done
so
the
ig
also
found
that
he
lacked
candor
when
questioned
by
fbi
agents
on
multiple
occasions
since
that
conversation
trump
blasts
cnn
for
disgraceful
hiring
of
ex-fbi
official
andrew
mccabe
mccabe
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
said
the
inspector
general's
conclusions
relied
on
mischaracterizations
and
omissions
including
of
information
favorable
to
mccabe
last
month
mccabe
sued
the
fbi
and
the
justice
department
over
his
firing
arguing
it
was
part
of
trump's
plan
to
rid
the
bureau
of
leaders
he
perceived
as
disloyal
to
him
mccabe
argued
in
his
complaint
that
the
two
officials
responsible
for
demoting
and
then
firing
mccabe
fbi
director
chris
wray
and
sessions
created
a
pretext
to
force
him
out
in
accordance
with
the
president's
wishes
the
stated
reason
for
the
firing
was
that
mccabe
had
misled
investigators
over
his
involvement
in
a
news
media
leak
but
mccabe
says
the
real
reason
was
his
refusal
to
pledge
allegiance
to
a
single
man
mccabe
has
been
attacked
by
the
president
since
before
he
was
elected
after
news
emerged
in
the
fall
of
that
mccabe's
wife
had
accepted
campaign
contributions
from
a
political
action
committee
associated
with
former
virginia
gov
terry
mcauliffe
during
an
unsuccessful
run
for
the
state
senate
there
mcauliffe
is
a
close
ally
of
bill
and
hillary
clinton
who
was
being
investigated
at
the
time
for
her
use
of
a
personal
email
server
while
she
was
secretary
of
state
after
mccabe's
hiring
