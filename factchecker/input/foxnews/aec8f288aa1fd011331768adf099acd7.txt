many

this

be
the
last
chance
for

for
those

the

consequences
for
the
damage
they
cause
in

to

on

of
swiss
ngo
hear
their
cries
told

that
if
the
case
is
accepted
for
review
it
will
allow
the

to
finally
examine
the
constitutionality
of
un
immunity
flaherty
pointed
to
a
case
from
the
last
session
of
the
court
as
a
reason
to
be
hopeful
that
the
justices
will
set
a
precedent
that
has
so
far
led
to
most
governments
including
that
of
the
u.s.
to
mostly
back
the
immunity
enjoyed
by

november
reuters
the
court
recently
decided
a
case
in
its
last
term
against
the
international
finance
corp
an
arm
of
the
world
bank
which
enjoys
similar
immunity
to
that
of
the
un
the
court
suggested
it
is
not
terribly
sympathetic
to
laws
that
deny
litigants
their
day
in
court
as
un
immunity
has
done
to
the
injured
haitians
in
after
years
of
avoiding
any
responsibility
then
u.n.
secretary
general
ban
ki-moon
apologized
to
the
people
of
haiti
for
the
united
nations
role
in
the
cholera
outbreak
telling
a
meeting
we
simply
did
not
do
enough
with
regard
to
the
cholera
outbreak
and
its
spread
in
haiti
we
are
profoundly
sorry
for
our
role
james
haggerty
the
lead
counsel
in
the
case
being
brought
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
told
fox
news
that
despite
the
u.n.
s
reassurances
and
the
promise
of
a
million
fund
no
victim
has
been
compensated
the
secretary
general
has
already
apologized
and
accepted
responsibility
stating
that
the
evidence
showed
the
u.n.
caused
the
death
and
illness
that
ravaged
haiti
any
argument
that
they
haven't
accepted
responsibility
for
what
they
did
to
the
people
of
haiti
is
a
fiction
and
they
had
previously
agreed
to
accept
liability
in
exactly
these
sorts
of
situations
haggerty
continued
the
trust
fund
was
announced
with
great
fanfare
but
to
my
knowledge
it
has
collected
little
over
these
trust
funds
are
no
more
than
pr
stunts
a
voluntary
passing
of
the
hat
the
un
acts
like
they
owe
haiti
only
voluntary
acts
of
kindness
rather
than
an
obligation
to
compensate
the
victims
of
this
plague
that's
why
trust
funds
sit
near
empty
while
the
victims
of
the
un's
recklessness
continue
to
suffer
accepting
liability
isn't
a
charitable
act
it's
an
enforceable
obligation
we
believe
the
supreme
court
is
going
to
agree
a
spokesman
for
the
u.n.
secretary
general
asked
why
the
world
body
continued
to
hide
behind
immunity
in
the
laventure
case
referred
fox
news
back
to
previous
statements
on
the
topic
omar
calls
for

handle

crisis
at
the
southern
border
courtney
smith
the
acting
dean
of
the
school
of
diplomacy
and
international
relations
at
seton
hall
university
told
fox
news
that
the
logic
for
giving
immunity
to
international
organizations
is
to
facilitate
their
ability
to
carry
out
their
duties
free
of
interference
by
the
governments
of
the
places
they
operate
he
continued
these
obstacles
can
be
insurmountable
if
national
governments
and
local
actors
are
able
to
impede
their
work
through
legal
restrictions
and
threats
of
politically
motivated
prosecutions
that
being
said
immunity
must
be
balanced
with
accountability
it
cannot
be
a
license
or
excuse
for
behavior
that
harms
the
reputation
and
impartiality
of
the
organization
even
though
immunity
is
a
legal
principle
its
actual
implementation
often
rests
on
political
calculations
haggerty
is
hopeful
the
justices
will
hear
his
case
there's
a
knee
jerk
reaction
to
a
case
against
the
un
that
they're
immune
because
they've
always
been
immune
we
fear
that's
why
there's
never
even
been
a
hearing
in
open
court
in
this
case
we're
hoping
the
u.s.
supreme
court
will
uphold
our
right
to
be
heard
meanwhile
flaherty
who
has
represented
several
u.n.
whistleblowers
in
corruption
and
retaliation
cases
at
the
world
body
said
a
court
ruling
in
the
plaintiffs
favor
would
be
groundbreaking
especially
in
reform
of
the
un's
draconian
practices
if
successful
the
challenge
in
laventure
to
u.n.
immunity
will
force
the
u.n.
to
dramatically
reform
its
corrupt
practices
and
root
out
its
rogue
employees
or
else
face
a
tsunami
of
lawsuits
in
the
us
if
not
in
the
other
jurisdictions
around
the
world
where
it
operates
which
could
threaten
its
very
existence

flaherty
concluded
u.s.
taxpayers
should
demand
no
less
from
a
humanitarian
entity
such
as
the
u.n.
than
it
demands
of
multinationals
that
operate
within
its
borders-
obey
local
laws
or
pay
the
civil
and
criminal
consequences
when
it
doesn't
haggerty
warned
the
next
haiti
is
out
there
just
waiting
to
happen
unfettered
immunity
is
a
cancer
that
is
rotting
the
un

the
core
