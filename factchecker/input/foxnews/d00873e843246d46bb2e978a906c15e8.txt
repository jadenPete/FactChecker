dating

decades
that
did
not

timed
as
democratic
presidential

refocus

on
the

the

warning
that

eliminated
if
the

failed

by
then
there
were
the
fears
that
the
world
would
experience
a
never-ending
cooling
trend
in
the
northern
hemisphere
that
claim
came
from
an
international
team
of
specialists
cited
by
the
new
york
times
in
just
years
prior
time
magazine
echoed
other
media
outlets
in
suggesting
that

was
imminent
telltale
signs
are
everywhere
from
the
unexpected
persistence
and

of

scientist's
claim
that
the
world
could
be
as
little
as
or
years
away
from
a
disastrous
new
ice
age
some
of
the
more
dire
predictions
came
from
paul

a
biologist
who
famously
urged
population
control
to
mitigate
the
impacts
of
humans
on

here's
why
dems
want
to
generate
climate
panic
as
they
ignore
ways
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
those
predictions
were
made
around
the
time
former
president
richard
nixon
created
the
environmental
protection
agency
since
then
the
u.s.
has
adopted
a
series
of
environmental
reforms
aimed
at
limiting
emissions
years
after
those
initial
predictions
media
outlets
and
politicians
continue
to
teem
with
claims
of
apocalyptic
scenarios
resulting
from
climate
change
earlier
this
month
leading
democratic
presidential
candidates
held
a
town
hall
on
the
issue
and
warned
about
the
existential
threat
posed
by
a
changing
climate
before
the
end
of
the
month
candidates
are
expected
to
have
another
climate
forum
at
georgetown
university
cei's
report
came
just
before
the
u.n.
climate
action
summit
on
sept
an
event
that
promises
to
spark
the
transformation
that
is
urgently
needed
and
propel
action
that
will
benefit
everyone
it
also
came
a
week
after
rep
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
warned
that
miami
would
be
gone
in
a
few
years
because
of
climate

she

her
ambitious

endorsed
by

presidential
candidates
previously
joked
that
the
world
would
end
in
years
if
it
didn't
address
climate
change
but
short-term
predictions
weren't
a
laughing
matter
in
the
years
following
an
inconvenient
truth
a
documentary
produced
by
former
vice
president
al
gore
in
abc
released
an
ominous
video
about
what
the
world
would
look
like
in

the
video
warned
about
rising
sea
levels
a

showed
significant

gore
himself
famously
predicted
in
the
early
s
that
arctic
ice
could
be
gone
within
seven
years
at
the
end
of
seven
years
arctic
ice
had
undergone
a
period
of
expansion
though
recently
it
has
been
melting
at
a
quicker
pace
