in
a
major
win
for
the
trump
administration
the
supreme
court
issued
an
order
late
wednesday
ending
all
injunctions
that
had
blocked
the
white
house's
ban
on
asylum
for
anyone
trying
to
enter
the
u.s.
by
traveling
through
a
third
country
such
as
mexico
without
seeking
protection
there
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
long
a
liberal
bastion
that
has
been
aggressively
reshaped
into
a
more
moderate
court
by
the
trump
administration
handed
the
white
house
a
partial
victory
in
the
case
on
monday
by
ending
the
nationwide
injunction
against
the
asylum
policy
however
the
th
circuit
kept
the
injunction
alive
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
circuit
which
encompasses
california
arizona
alaska
hawaii
montana
nevada
idaho
guam
oregon
and
washington
the
supreme
court's
order
was
not
a
final
ruling
on
the
policy's
merits
but
does
allow
the
policy
to
take
effect
nationwide
including
in
the
th
circuit
while
the
case
makes
its
way
through
the
lower
courts
trump
admin
announces
major
crackdown
on
asylum
seekers
citing
widespread
fraud
president
trump
tweeted
that
the
ruling
was
a
big
united
states
supreme
court
win
for
the
border
on
asylum
the
administration
had
argued
in
a
brief
to
the
supreme
court
that
unless
the
injunctions
were
totally
lifted
everywhere
it
would
severely
disrupt
the
orderly
administration
of
an
already
overburdened
asylum
system
only
justices
sonia
sotomayor
and
ruth
bader
ginsburg
dissented
once
again
the
executive
branch
has
issued
a
rule
that
seeks
to
upend
longstanding
practices
regarding
refugees
who
seek
shelter
from
persecution
sotomayor
and
ginsburg
wrote
they
added
that
they
were
disappointed
the
majority
failed
to
exercise
restraint
and
instead
intervened
in
the
lower-court
matter
before
it
was
fully
resolved
the
white
house
however
said
the
lower
court
had
overreached
in
an
all-too-familiar
manner
we
are
pleased
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
our
administration
can
implement
important
needed
fixes
to
the
broken
asylum
system
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
said
this
greatly
helps
build
on
the
progress
we've
made
addressing
the
crisis
at
our
southern
border
and
will
ultimately
make
american
communities
safer
gidley
added
the
district
court's
erroneous
nationwide
injunction
was
another
in
a
series
of
overreaching
orders
that
allowed
a
single
non-elected
district
court
judge
to
override
policy
decisions
for
the
entire
nation
while
there
is
much
more
work
still
to
be
done
thankfully
the
supreme
court
took
a
decisive
step
here
and
rejected
the
lower
court's
egregious
ruling
the
doj
also
said
the
ruling
would
bring
order
to
the
crisis

said
they
were
gravely
disappointed
lives
will
be
lost
nadler
and
lofgren
said
this
rule
will
result
in
those
fleeing
fear
and
persecution
to
be
turned
away
at
our
doorstep
and
will
only
exacerbate
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
central
american
region
the
united

can
and
must
do
better
the
legal
challenge
to
the
new
policy
has
a
brief
but
somewhat
convoluted
history
obama-appointed
u.s.
district
judge
jon
tigar
in
san
francisco
blocked
the
new
policy
from
taking
effect
in
late
july
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
th
u.s.
circuit
court
of
appeals
narrowed

order
so
that
it
effectively
applied

left

on

arriving

and

tigar
issued
a
new
order
on
monday
that
reimposed
a
nationwide
hold
on
asylum
policy
citing
new
evidence
in
his
ruling
monday
tigar
stressed
a
need
to
maintain
uniform
immigration
policy
and
found
that
nonprofit
organizations
such
as
al
otro
lado
don't
know
where
asylum
seekers
who
enter
the
u.s.
will
end
up
living
and
making
their
case
to
remain
in
the
country
president
trump
said
he
disagreed
with
the
judge's
ruling
and
the
idea
of
single
federal
judges
issuing
nationwide
injunctions
in
general
a
phenomenon
that
has
exploded

his
administration

for
a
trip
to

i
don't
think
it
should
be
allowed
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
said
in
a
statement
that
a
sole
judge
shouldn't
have
the
ability
to
exert
such
a
broad
impact
on
immigration
policy
this
ruling
is
a
gift
to
human
smugglers
and
traffickers
and
undermines
the
rule
of
law
she
said
the
th
circuit
court
of
appeals
then
narrowed
tiger's
his
order
again
on
monday
by
issuing
an
administrative
stay

high-court
action

the

free
to
impose
the
new
policy
everywhere
while
the
court
case
against
it
continues
how
trump
has
reshaped
the
th
circuit
the
rules
issued
by
the
trump
administration
in
july
apply
to
most
migrants
who
pass
through
another
country
before
reaching
the
united
states
they
target
tens
of
thousands
of
central
americans
fleeing
violence
and
poverty
who
travel
through
mexico
each
month
to
seek
asylum
in
the
u.s.
and
would
affect
asylum
seekers
from
africa
asia
and
south
america
who
arrive
regularly
at
the
southern
border
the
shift
reversed
decades
of
u.s.
policy
in
what
trump
administration
officials
said
was
an
attempt
to
close
the
gap
between
an
initial
asylum
screening
that
most
people
pass
and
a
final
decision
on
asylum
that
most
people
do
not
win
u.s.
law
allows
refugees
to
request
asylum
when
they
get
to
the
u.s.
regardless
of
how
they
arrive
or
cross
the
crucial
exception
is
for
those
who
have
come
through
a
country
considered
to
be
safe
but
the
law
is
vague
on
how
a
country
is
determined
to
be
safe
it
says
pursuant
to
a
bilateral
or
multilateral
agreement

because
they
would

based

nationality
or

the
vast
majority
of
asylum
claims
are
denied
however
and
the
administration
has
said
the
system
is
being
abused
as
a
means
of
economic
and
humanitarian
relief
when
it
was
intended
to
be
used
for
limited
and
extraordinary
cases
asylum
claims
have
spiked
since
and
there
is
currently
a
backlog
of
more
than
cases
pending
in
immigration
court
most
asylum
claims
often
fail
to
meet
this
high
legal
standard
after
they
are
reviewed
by
asylum
judges

drop
in

from
july
amid

heat
and
an
aggressive
crackdown
on
both
sides
of
the

to

migrants
the
drop
was
more
significant
than
it
was
during
the
same
period
last
year

what
officials
called
a
clear
sign
that
its

curb

trump
tweeted
late
wednesday
he
added
the
southern
border
is
becoming
very
strong
despite
the
obstruction
by
democrats
not
agreeing
to
do
anything
on
loopholes
or
asylum
the
migrants
apprehended
or
deemed
inadmissible
represents
a
percent
drop
from
july
when
were
apprehended
and
a
percent
drop
from
the
peak
of
the
crisis
in
may
when
more
than
migrants
were
caught
or
deemed
inadmissible
while
the
numbers
typically
drop
in
the
summer
the
plummet
is
steeper
than
typical
seasonal
declines
the
trump
administration
has
reason
for
optimism
now
that
the
case
is
back
in
the
th
circuit
the
san
francisco-based
appellate
court
has
seven
trump-appointed
federal
judges
more
than
any
other
federal
appellate
bench
the
radical
transformation
of
the
court
which
has
seats
is
largely
the
result
of

push
to
nominate
conservative
judges
