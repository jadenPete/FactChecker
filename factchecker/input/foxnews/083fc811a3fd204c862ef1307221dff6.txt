build
the
wall
became
the
unofficial
rallying
cry
of
then-candidate
donald
trump's
campaign
three
years
later
amid
a
series
of
legal
and
political
setbacks
that
have
raised
questions
about
the
project's
future
the
trump
administration
is
making
a
renewed
effort
to
show
voters
the
u.s.
mexico
border
wall
remains
a
top
priority
touting
recent
construction
and
vowing
to
pick
up
the
pace
going
into
border
apprehensions
plunge
as
trump
administration
hails
mexico
pact
the
purchase
of
critical
strips
of
private
land
has
cleared
the
way
they
argue
for
a
new
phase
the
plan
officials
told
reporters
at
a
briefing
this
week
is
to
construct
upwards
of
miles
by
the
end
of
next
year
a
massive
undertaking
representing
nearly
eight
times
what
construction
teams
have
erected
to
date
it's
going
up
fast
and
we're
putting
it
where
the
border
patrol
most
wants
it
trump
said
in
a
video
message
sunday
we're
taking
money
from
all
over
because
as
you
know
the
democrats
don't
want
us
to
build
the
wall
they're
fighting
us
at
every
step
the
president
has
made
recent
gains
in
his
immigration
agenda
the
administration
announced
new
stats
on
monday
showing
the
number
of
border
apprehensions
in
august
was
a
plunge
of
percent
since
may
while
still
historically
high
administration
officials
said
it
shows
diplomacy
efforts
with
countries
like
mexico
is
paying
dividends
meanwhile
the
administration
has
announced
a
formal
public
charge
rule
cracking
down
on
immigrants
who
claim
welfare
an
overhaul
to
the
flores
settlement
that
limits
how
long
children
and
families
can
be
kept
in
custody
and
a
rule
that
stops
asylum
seekers
who
have
passed
through
other
countries
from
claiming
asylum
in
the
u.s.
while
many
of
the
government
efforts
are
facing
major
court
challenges
and
decried
by
critics
as
an
overreach
they
mark
an
aggressive
push
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
and
overhaul
the
legal
immigration
system
the
wall
has
faced
its
own
set
of
challenges
trump
struggled
to
get
funding
from
congress
and
faced
hurdles
like
the
challenge
of
securing
private
land
needed
for
new
wall
construction
democrats
are
almost
entirely
opposed
to
a
wall
saying
it
is
a
waste
of
money
and
against
american
values
but
in
july
the
court
sided
with
the
administration
in
lifting
a
freeze
that
halted
plans
to
use
pentagon
money
for
wall
construction
last
week
the
pentagon
announced
it
intends
to
shift
billion
to
wall
construction
as
part
of
a
series
of
moves
the
administration
is
using
to
get
around
the
congressional
logjam
when
it
comes
to
wall
funding
the
administration
touts
that
approximately
miles
of
new
border
wall
system
have
been
built
so
far
critics
note
that
this
represents
replacement
wall
in
areas
that
already
had
existing
barriers
and
fencing
but
administration
officials
have
pushed
back
saying
what's
being
replaced
is
largely
landing-mat
barriers
that
can
be
pushed
over
or
normandy-style
crosses
that
can
be
stepped
over
administration
officials
pose
the
seussian
question
if
a
wall
can
easily
fall
then
is
it
even
a
wall
at
all
when
you
take
that
down
and
you
put
in
what
is
being
built
now
that
is
a
new
wall
one
official
said
at
a
briefing
in
washington
earlier
this
week
it's
feet
tall
it's
embedded
in
concrete
the
structure
is
incredibly
strong
it
has
anti-climbing
techniques
it's
also
got
additional
technology
lighting
access
roads
etc
so
it
really
is
a
wall
system
so
anywhere
the
wall
is
being
built
it's
new
wall
arguments
about
new
or
replacement
wall
aside
the
administration
is
now
planning
an
aggressive
push
to
build
more
wall
by
the
end
of
next
year
which
happens
to
be
when
the
presidential
election
is
being
held
build
the
wall
will
surely
return
to
the
rally
rotation
as
the
trump
re-election
campaign
moves
into
full
swing
perhaps
driven
in
part
by
political
urgency
trump
has
lit
a
fire
under
his
team
to
get
the
job
done
according
to
the
washington
post
he
told
aides
he
wants
the
miles
done
by
election
day
and
has
suggested
he
would
pardon
officials
if
they
break
the
law
the
white
house
has
denied
that
trump
floated
pardons
much
of
that
miles
is
what
the
administration
is
calling
new
linear
wall
wall
where
there
was
no
structure
before
officials
say
they
are
anticipating
building
miles
of
new
linear
wall
miles
in
the
rio
grande
valley
sector
alone
as
for
where
they
say
they
are
listening
to
agents
on
the
ground
and
different
sectors
have
different
needs
in
the
laredo
sector
for
instance
agents
told
fox
news
last
month
that
the
wall
was
a
top
priority
as
they
face
a
higher
number
of
single
adult
males
crossing
the
border
and
evading
capture
on
the
border
officials
see
dividends
from
trump's
deal
with
mexico
democrats
meanwhile
have
objected
to
the
cost
of
the
wall
and
the
project
as
a
whole
on
thursday
sen
patrick
leahy
d-vt
noted
that
trump
had
promised
mexico
would
pay
for
the
barrier
and
called
it
an
ineffective
wall
that
was
based
on
a
cynical
campaign
promise
and
bears
no
relation
to
the
real
national
security
issues
this
country
faces
administration
officials
deny
that
this
amounts
to
a
presidential
vanity
project
this
isn't
like
we're
building
just
to
show
we're
making
progress
we're
building
where
border
patrol
have
said
their
priorities
are
another
official
said
they
are
also
saying
they
are
putting
up
wall
quicker
than
past
administrations
after
the
secure
fence
act
passed
in
under
the
bush
administration
the
path
from
appropriations
to
digging
was
a
two-year
cycle
now
officials
say
they've
been
getting
the
process
done
in
less
than
a
year
additionally
one
of
the
hurdles
facing
the
administration
has
been
that
much
of
the
territory
they
need
for
the
project
is
on
privately
owned
land
requiring
the
government
purchase
land
a
lengthy
process
now
that
a
lot
of
that
land
has
been
bought
officials
say
the
pace
can
pick
up
and
crews
can
build
multiple
structures
simultaneously
we've
been
doing
that
so
you're
going
to
see
the
pace
of
this
construction
of
new
linear
miles
in
areas
that
were
not
federally
owned
accelerate
over
the
coming
weeks
and
months
especially
when
the
dod
gets
in
the
game
the
official
said
so
we're
going
to
go
from
two
to
three
miles
a
week
to
a
lot

trump
supporters
will
be
keeping
a
close
eye
on
what
is
going
on
with
wall
construction
on
monday
night
trump
attended
a
rally
in
fayetteville
n.c.
where
he
tagged
democratic
house
candidate
dan
mccready
as
a
proponent
of
sanctuary
cities
we're
building
that
wall
and
it's
very
big
he
said
the
sustained
chant
that
followed
was
both
a
message
of
support
and
an
instruction
to
the
president
build
the
wall
they
chanted
