and

democratic
presidential
candidate
sen
elizabeth
warren
on
monday
unveiled
a
wide-ranging
and
detailed
plan
to
crack
down
on
corruption
in
government
the
need
for
stricter
ethics
laws
has
long
been
a
central
theme
of
the
massachusetts
democrat's
white
house
bid
and
warren
has
repeatedly
said
it
would
be
her
first
legislative
priority
if
she
wins
the
presidential
election
in
announcing
her
plan
warren
called
it
the
most
sweeping
set
of
anti-corruption
reforms
since
watergate
bernie
sanders
shakes
up
campaign
leadership
in
crucial
primary
state
the
senator
has
emphasized
on
the
campaign
trail
that
she
blames
the
entrenched
culture
of
lobbying
in
the
nation's
capital
and
the
flood
of
big
money
into
politics
for
grinding
to
a
halt
any
potential
progress
to
pass
legislation
on
such
top
issues
as
gun
violence
climate
change
and
out-of-control
health
care
costs
among
other
things
her
set
of
proposals
would
ban
federal
lawmakers
and
the
top
congressional
staffers
from
serving
on
corporate
boards
and
would
mandate
that
every
new
member
of
congress
make
public
any
potential
financial
conflicts
before
taking
office
the
plan
also
calls
for
corporate
lobbyists
to
wait
six
years
before
being
able
to
take
federal
government
jobs
and
it
would
permanently
prevent
the
president
vice
president
cabinet
officials
and
federal
judges
from
working
as
lobbyists
after
leaving
office
or
the
bench
the
latest
from
fox
news
on
the
presidential
campaign
to
end
lobbying
as
we
know
it
warren
would
broaden
the
definition
of
lobbying
and
would
ban
them
from
working
on
behalf
of
foreign
governments
and
domestically
she
would
prevent
them
from
making
political
contributions
acting
as
bundlers
where
they
pool
donations
from
multiple
people
and
hosting
fundraisers
for
candidates
in
introducing
her
plan
warren
highlighted
the
deterioration
of
public
confidence
in
government
in
just
of
americans
trusted
government
to
do
the
right
thing
why
because
our
government
works
great
for
the
wealthy
and
well-connected
but
not
for
everyone
else
that's
corruption
plain
and
simple
and
i've
got
a
plan
to
fight
back
she
tweeted
as
she's
done
in
the
past
warren
specifically
took
aim
at
president
trump
and
his
administration
saying
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
trump
administration
is
the
most
corrupt
administration
of
our
lifetimes
warren
proposed
creating
a
new
u.s.
office
of
public
integrity
which
would
investigate
ethics
complaints
from
the
public
and
impose
penalties
on
violators
or
refer
egregious
violations
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
prosecution
warren
unwrapped
her
anti-corruption
proposals
hours
ahead
of
a
rally
and
speech
monday
evening
at
new
york
city's
washington
square
park
which
is
close
to
the
site
of
the
infamous
triangle
shirtwaist
factory
fire
the
industrial
disaster
in
which
nearly
people
were
killed
led
to
the
passage
of
groundbreaking
workplace
safety
regulations
monday's
speech
will
likely
touch
on
many
of
the
same
themes
the
populist
senator
spotlighted
during
her
formal
campaign
kickoff
in
february
in
front
of
historic
textile
mill
buildings
in
the
working-class
city
of
lawrence
mass
that
were
the
site
of
a
famous
labor
strike
in
the
warren
campaign
confirmed
that
the
candidate
will
use
a
teleprompter
for
her
monday
evening
speech
which
she
rarely
uses
on
the
campaign
trail
