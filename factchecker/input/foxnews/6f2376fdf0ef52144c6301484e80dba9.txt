margaret
low
president
of
atlanticlive
wrote
in
an
email
to
staff
obtained
by
the
hill
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
the
hill
that
several
atlantic
staffers
protested
the
decision
to
include
nielsen
in
the
festival
but
a
magazine
spokesperson
said
nielsen's
invitation
was
not
rescinded
so
that
is
percent
inaccurate
but
liberal
organizations
took
credit
and
also
criticized
the
atlantic
for
initially
including
the
former
trump
administration
immigration
official
on
the
festival's
set
list
the
announcement
came
following
backlash
from
a
progressive
grassroots
group
called
credo
action
which
claimed
public
pressure
from
thousands
of
credo
members
and
grassroots
activists
forced
kirstjen
nielsen
to
withdraw
from
the
atlantic
fest
which
is
a
huge
victory
and
should
set
a
precedent
for
not
putting
profits
over
morals
when
it
comes
to
trump
administration
alumni
credo
action
campaign
director
nicole
regalado
told
the
hill
no
one
from
trump's
administration
should
get
a
soft
landing
to
sanitize
their
actions
while
supporting
and
pushing
forward
a
white
nationalist
fascist
agenda
the
group
also
threatened
that
the
media
and
corporations
should
think
twice
before
giving
a
platform
to
people
who
worked
hand-in-hand
with
trump
to
separate
families
lock
babies
up
in
cages
and
terrorize
communities
of
color
public
backlash
will
be
swift
and
powerful
for
anyone
who
tries
to
help
rehabilitate
the
reputations
of
trump's
top
henchmen

in
a
