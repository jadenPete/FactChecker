fair
juli
n
castro
took
former
vice
president
joe
biden
to
task
at
last
week's
democratic
presidential
primary
debate
for
trying
to
downplay
his
role
in
the
obama
administration's
immigration
policies
but
castro
wasn't
always
a
big
critic
of
those
policies
either
in
when
castro
was
mayor
of
san
antonio
he
said
obama
certainly
gets
it
when
it
comes
to
immigration
and
treating
people
humanely
democratic
presidential
candidates
debate
who
will
best
keep
obama's
legacy
he's
easily
been
the
best
friend
that
latinos
have
had
in
the
white
house
castro
told
the
texas
tribune
later
that
year
in
an
interview
with
charlie
rose
castro
was
asked
to
describe
the
best
and
most
realistic
immigration
policy
and
his
answer
now
sounds
almost
trumpian
first
it
s
going
to
continue
to
make
sure
that
the
borders
are
secure
it
s
going
to
enhance
that
he
said
secondly
work
with
employers
to
establish
an
even
better
system
so
that
they
can
know
when
they
hire
someone
that
they
re
hiring
someone
who
s
here
legally
and
then
third
it
s
going
to
set
up
some
way
to
deal
with
the
to
million
folks
who
are
here
undocumented
illegal
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
video
from
a
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
flagged
this
week
by
the
washington
free
beacon
also
shows
castro
endorsing
a
relatively
tough
approach
to
the
border
he
discussed
how
the
obama
administration
achieved
unprecedented
success
in
deporting
dangerous
individuals
due
to
having
more
boots
on
the
ground
along
the
border
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
history
when
asked
if
interior
enforcement
should
be
used
to
discourage
future
illegal
immigrants
by
keeping
them
from
getting
jobs
castro
said
going
forward
of
course
enforcement
is
part
of
the
conversation
castro
who
later
became
president
barack
obama's
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
also
touted
active
enforcement
on
our
borders
and
said
that
under
obama
there
has
been
tremendous
progress
with
regard
to
enforcement
obama's
critics
however
referred
to
him
as
the
deporter
in
chief
cut
to
and
castro
criticized
biden
for
trying
to
take
credit
for
obama's
work
but
not
have
to
answer
to
any
questions
after
biden
was
challenged
on
obama-era
immigration
enforcement
policies
during
last
week's
debate
he
is
also
distancing
himself
from
his
past
support
for
obama's
policies
he
was
applauding
the
administration's
effort
to
prioritize
immigration
enforcement
not
their
efforts
to
deport
mass
numbers
of
immigrants
castro
campaign
spokesperson
sawyer
hackett
told
the
texas
tribune
castro's
current
position
is
far
removed
from
when
he
described
obama's
immigration
enforcement
practices
as
progress
he
now
calls
for
decriminalizing
illegal
border
crossings
and
wants
undocumented
immigrants
to
receive
free
health
care
at
a
time
when
president
trump
accuses
democrats
of
supporting
open
borders
during
that
same
hearing
castro
said
that
open
borders
would
be
an
extreme
policy
nobody
agrees
with
open
borders
he
said
everyone
agrees
we
need
to
secure
our
border
candidates
push
back
on
castro
for
questioning
biden's
memory
former
obama
officials
have
hardly
been
on
the
same
page
regarding
the
current
immigration
debate
former
obama
homeland
security
secretary
jeh
johnson
told
the
washington
post
in
july
that
decriminalizing
unauthorized
border
crossings
would
be
tantamount
to
declaring
publicly
that
we
have
open
borders
and
that
it
is
unworkable
unwise
and
does
not
have
the
support
of
a
majority
of
american
people
or
the
congress
and
if
we
had
such
a
policy
instead
of
apprehensions
a
month
it
will
be
multiples
of
that
when
asked
during
a
june
abc
news
interview
if
his
current
policies
were
essentially
the
same
as
open
borders
castro
said
there's
no
way
that
we
can
call
that
open
borders
because
we
have
miles
of
fencing
we
have
thousands
of
personnel
at
the
border
we
have
planes
we
have
helicopters
boats
security
cameras
guns
according
to
his
website
however
castro's
immigration
plan
would
e
ffectively
end
the
use
of
detention
in
conducting
immigration
enforcement
except
in
serious
cases
it
also
calls
for
ending
border
wall
construction
and
cutting
u.s.
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
ice
in
half
by
getting
rid
of
enforcement
and
removal
operations
by
spreading
its
responsibilities
to
other
agencies
like
the
justice
department
he
also
noted
that
there
is
a
civil
court
system
where
people
can
still
be
deported
and
that
not
everyone
who
applies
for
asylum
gets
it
when
asked
by
fox
news
how
castro's
current
policies
can
be
reconciled
with
his
past
statements
and
how
prohibitions
on
illegal
immigration
would
be
enforced
according
to
his
plan
castro's
campaign
did
not
respond
in
a
recent
statement
to
the
texas
tribune
hackett
said
secretary
castro
unlike
some
candidates
running
in
has
learned
the
lessons
of
the
past
on
immigration
reform
including
that
no
amount
of
deportations
will
bring
republicans
to
the
table
to
negotiate
one
position
that
castro
has
clearly
maintained
over
the
years
is
his
support
for
creating
a
pathway
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
immigrants
already
in
the
u.s.
i
do
believe
that
a
pathway
to
citizenship
should
be
the
option
he
said
in
i
do
not
see
that
as
an
extreme
option
