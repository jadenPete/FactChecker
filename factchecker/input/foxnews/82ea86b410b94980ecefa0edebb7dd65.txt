campaign
said
the

by
the
campaign
we
consulted

the
freedom

are
fully

fec
regulations
the
campaign
said
in
a
statement
with
help
of
yang
gang
andrew
yang
elbows
his
way
to
dem
debate
stage
a
central
part
of
yang's
campaign
pitch
is
his
expensive
proposal
to
give
all
americans
what
he
calls
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
he
has
said
he
would
pay
for
it
by
putting
a
european-style
value-added
tax
on
tech
companies
yang
is
already
personally
funding
a
a
month
freedom
dividend
for
three
families
some
lawyers
though
questioned
the
legality
of
the
payments
so
andrewyang
is
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
many
ways
but
not
sure
he
vetted
his
month
to
voters
from
campaign
funds
with
an
actual
lawyer
tweeted
preet
bharara
the
former
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
but
speaking
to
fox
news
earlier
this
year
yang
insisted
that
giving
away
money
to
voters
is
percent
legal
saying
he
consulted
lawyers
and
the
federal
election
commission
first
he
denied
it
amounts
to
buying
votes
all
you
have
to
do
is
talk
to
any
of
the
people
that
are
actually
receiving
the
freedom
dividend
and
ask
them
has
anyone
from
my
campaign
ever
said
that
they
need
to
do
anything
in
return
and
you
will
categorically
no
they
can
vote
for
whoever
they
like
yang

the
forthcoming
debate
stunt
tweeting
earlier

got
something
big
in

himself

different
from
the
other

president
posting
a

prep
video
