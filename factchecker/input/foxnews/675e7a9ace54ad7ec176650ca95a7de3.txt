corrupt
do
you

your
government
is
according
to
transparency
international
which
has
been
ranking
countries
on
its
scale
for
years
the
united
states
is
not
very
corrupt
at
all
the
most
recent
rankings
built
through
a
survey
of
experts
and
businesspeople
ranks
the
u.s.
as
nd
cleanest
in
the
nations
of
the
world
we
run
in
a
pack
with
other
mostly
western
liberal
democracies
like
australia
britain
and
france
just
behind
the
squeaky
clean
scandinavian
nations
and
of
course
canada
we
are
far
removed
from
the
rampant
corruption
under
which
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
is
forced
to
live
russia
china
india
and
brazil
are
all
bad
news
when
it
comes
to
basic
principles
of
fairness
all
of
africa
except
for
botswana
and
every
asian
nation
except
japan
are
considered
substantially
corrupt
so
your
government
on
an
empirical
basis
is
pretty
much
on
the
level
but
that's
not
the
important
question
what
matters
is
how
corrupt
do
you
think
your
government
is
and
on
that
score
the
news
is
bad
in
our
most
recent
fox
news
poll
we
asked
respondents
how
many
people
in
the
government
do
you
think
are
corrupt
almost
all
many
some
or
almost
none
the
results
should
be
sobering
for
everyone
concerned
about
the
current
trajectory
of
politics
about
one
in
five
said
that
almost
all
of
the
people
in
government
are
corrupt
an
amazing
percent
said
that
many
are
crooked
just
percent
got
closer
to
reality
saying
that
some
in
the
government
are
corrupt
a
sad
percent
said
almost
none
as
with
all
reputational
goods
like
a
nation's
currency
the
perception
of
value
is
far
more
important
than
the
actual
value
itself
if
a
government
is
perceived
as
corrupt
it's
almost
as
bad
as
the
real
thing
and
will
eventually
result
in
real
corruption
anyway
if
you
think
the
game
is
rigged
you're
far
more
likely
to
be
willing
to
cheat
yourself
the
percent
of
americans
who
believe
their
government
is
rotten
with
corruption
don't
belong
to
any
particular
demographic
or
political
group
either
women
are
a
little
more
distrustful
than
men
and
white
people
are
more
dubious
than
other
ethnic
groups
whites
without
college
degrees
most
of
all
but
religious
faith
political
proclivities
education
and
income
all
had
relatively
little
bearing
on
the
overall
perception
that
corruption
is
a
major
problem
in
our
government
it's
no
wonder
given
what
both
political
parties
are
selling
these
days
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
response
was
really
about
draining
the
swamp
and
some
sustained
effort
for
reforms
that
might
bring
public
perception
back
into
alignment
with
reality
but
what
tends
to
happen
is
that
politicians
exploit
such
perceptions
to
create
lower
expectations
for
good
government
and
accountability
once
they
are
in
power
if
the
whole
system
is
rigged
why
should
our
side
have
to
play
by
the
rules
after
all
they're
the
real
crooks
that's
how
the
false
perception
of
rampant
corruption
makes
way
for
the
real
thing
the
rulebook
there's
a
difference
it
is
that
in
a
democracy
the
people
meet
and
exercise
the
government
in
person
in
a
republic
they
assemble
and
administer
it
by
their
representatives
and
agents
a
democracy
consequently
will
be
confined
to
a
small
spot
a
republic
may
be
extended
over
a
large
region

biden
racks
up
key
endorsementsap
joe
biden
sought
to
demonstrate
a
broad
appeal
to
democrats
on
thursday
with
new
endorsements
from
leading
african
american
lawmakers
and
a
former
governor
of
a
pivotal
swing
state
the
backing
from
reps
g.k.
butterfield
of
north
carolina
emanuel
cleaver
of
missouri
and
charlie
crist
of
florida
reflects
biden's
play
both
for
the
party
establishment
and
for
minority
voters
who
are
critical
in
the
early
stages
of
the
primary
butterfield
and
cleaver
are
former
chairmen
of
the
congressional
black
caucus
and
crist
was
the
governor
of
florida
before
he
entered
congress
the
moves
are
the
latest
example
of
biden's
durability
as
an
early
democratic
front-runner
so
far
he's
successfully
threaded
different
wings
of
the
party
despite
skepticism
from
progressives
and
questions
about
whether
at
he's
too
old
for
the
presidency
t
he
support
of
butterfield
and
cleaver
in
particular
is
a
potential
blow
to

younger

voters
try
to
pry
their
parents
from
biden
nyt
if
mr
biden
is
going
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
it
is
likely
to
be
because
of
the
support
of
older
black
voters
but
if
he
is
to
be
overtaken
by
one
of
his
more
progressive
rivals
the
most
powerful
tool
against
him
may
not
be
opposition
research
or
negative
advertisements
instead
it
may
be
an
organic
effort
by
younger
black
voters
concerned
about
mr
biden's
age
and
more
moderate
ideology
to
sway
their
older
family
members
mr
biden
seems
aware
of
this
dynamic
in
interviews
he
has
both
acknowledged
the
generational
gap
among
his
black
supporters
and
downplayed
its
importance
arguing
that
the
support
of
older
more
moderate
black
voters
would
be
enough
to
give
him
an
electoral
advantage
still
mr
biden
by
his
own
admission
would
be
unwise
to
underestimate
the
lobbying
efforts

and

already
have
whittled
a
list
of

contenders
for
isakson's
seat
down
to
a
handful
and
that
the
online

process
unveiled
late
tuesday
will
be
largely
for
show
but
encouraging
would-be
u.s.

caleb
bennettwfts
a
freak
boating
accident
left
a
year-old
manatee
county
boy
with
an
anchor
lodged
in
his
skull
and
doctors
call
his
survival
story
one
in
a
million
i
can't
believe
i
had
an
anchor
in
my
head
like
that's
pretty
crazy
caleb
bennett
said
my
friends
now
call
me
the
anchorman
so
that's
kind
of
cool
i'm
kind
of
a
big
deal
around
here
caleb
and
his
family
love
to
fish
on
the
manatee
river
and
that's
exactly
what
the
teenager
was
doing
when
the
accident
happened
his
parents
kelli
and
rick
bennett
were
in
the
bahamas
celebrating
their
wedding
anniversary
when
they
got
the
call
caleb
told
the
johns
hopkins
all
children's
hospital
he
remembered
feeling
the
anchor
and
thinking
he
just
needed
to
stay
calm
caleb
was
flown
to
johns
hopkins
in
st
petersburg
where
he
immediately
underwent
brain
surgery
luis
rodriguez
m.d.
a
pediatric
neurological
surgeon
at
johns
hopkins
told
the
family
how
lucky
it
was
that
the
anchor
didn't
touch
any
of
the
blood
vessels
in
caleb's
brain
his
caretakers
say
he's
a
miracle
and
now
a
word
from
charles
wounding
a
president
by
reversing
his
most
cherished
foreign
policy
goal
is
an
understandable
political
instinct
but
if
it
wounds
the
country
it
is
a
bad
one
