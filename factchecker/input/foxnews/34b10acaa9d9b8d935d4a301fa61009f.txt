attorneys
for
former
deputy
fbi
director
andrew
mccabe
on
thursday
called
on
the
justice
department
to
immediately
close
what
they
called
a
fatally
flawed
investigation
of
allegations
against
him
amid
speculation
mccabe
could
be
indicted
mccabe's
attorneys
michael
bromwich
and
david
schertler
on
thursday
blasted
the
probe
as
a
waste
of
governmental
resources
they
also
ripped
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
providing
them
with
no
information
in
response
to
their
requests
regarding
the
status
of
the
probe
into
their
client
us
attorney
recommends
proceeding
with
charges
against
mccabe
as
doj
rejects
last-ditch
appeal
this
investigation
has
been
fatally
flawed
from
its
inception
they
said
in
a
statement
it
has
been
irrevocably
tainted
by
the
president's
targeting
of
mr
mccabe
for
prosecution
the
investigation
has
now
dragged
on
for
more
than
months
with
no
resolution
in
sight
bromwich
and
schertler
said
the
investigation
was
deeply
unfair
to
mccabe
and
his
family
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
should
close
this
investigation
immediately
and
move
on
to
fight
battles
more
worthy
of
the
traditions
of
the
department
of
justice
they
said
the
comments
come
after
u.s.
attorney
jessie
liu
recommended
moving
forward
with
charges
against
mccabe
last
week
mccabe
appealed
the
decision
of
liu
all
the
way
up
to
deputy
attorney
general
jeffrey
rosen
who
ultimately
rejected
that
request
the
potential
charges
relate
to
doj
inspector
general
findings
against
him
regarding
misleading
statements
concerning
a
hillary
clinton-related
investigation
a
source
close
to
mccabe's
legal
team
said
they
received
an
email
from
the
justice
department
last
week
which
said
the
department
rejected
your
appeal
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office's
decision
in
this
matter
any
further
inquiries
should
be
directed
to
the
united
states
attorney's
office
mccabe
served
at
the
fbi
for
years
he
became
the
acting
director
in
may
after
president
trump
fired
former
director
james
comey
former
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
fired
mccabe
in
march
after
the
inspector
general
found
he
had
repeatedly
misstated
his
involvement
in
a
leak
to
the
wall
street
journal
regarding
an
fbi
investigation
into
the
clinton
foundation
the
ig
report
faulted
mccabe
for
leaking
information
to
then-wall
street
journal
reporter
devlin
barrett
for
an
oct
story
titled
fbi
in
internal
feud
over
hillary
clinton
probe
the
story
written
just
days
before
the
presidential
election
focused
on
the
fbi
announcing
the
reopening
of
the
clinton
investigation
after
finding
thousands
of
her
emails
on
a
laptop
belonging
to
former
democratic
rep
anthony
weiner
who
was
married
to
clinton
aide
huma
abedin
mccabe
blasts
doj
criminal
probe
vows
not
to
take
deal
the
journal's
account
of
the
call
said
a
senior
justice
department
official
expressed
displeasure
to
mccabe
that
fbi
agents
were
still
looking
into
the
clinton
foundation
and
that
mccabe
had
defended
the
agent's
authority
to
pursue
the
issue
that
leak
confirmed
the
existence
of
the
probe
the
report
said
which
comey
had
up
to
that
point
refused
to
do
the
report
said
that
mccabe
lacked
candor
in
a
conversation
with
comey
when
he
said
he
had
not
authorized
the
disclosure
and
didn't
know
who
had
done
so
the
ig
also
found
that
he
lacked
candor
when
questioned
by
fbi
agents
on
multiple
occasions
since
that
conversation
mccabe's
attorneys
on
thursday
also
argued
that
justice
department
personnel
were
leaking
information
about
the
investigation
to
reporters
citing
conversations
with
journalists
who
said
there
would
be
a
grand
jury
reconvening
and
that
mccabe
could
be
indicted
at
that
time
the
reporters
could
only
have
obtained
this
information
from
personnel
at
the
department
of
justice
or
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
such
leaks
are
prohibited
by
the
rules
governing
grand
jury
secrecy
they
said
these
leaks
in
violation
of
doj
policy
are
particularly
ironic
given
that
the
entire
predicate
for
any
false
statements
charges
that
might
be
brought
against
our
client
is
an
authorized
disclosure
of
information
that
he
directed
be
made
in
october
mccabe
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
said
the
inspector
general's
conclusions
relied
on
mischaracterizations
and
omissions
including
of
information
favorable
to
mccabe

last
month
mccabe
sued
the
fbi
and
the
justice
department
over
his
firing
arguing
it
was
part
of
trump's
plan
to
rid
the
bureau
of
leaders
he
perceived
as
disloyal
to
him
mccabe
argued
in
his
complaint
that
the
two
officials
responsible
for
demoting
and
then
firing
mccabe
fbi
director
chris
wray
and
sessions
created
a
pretext
to
force
him
out
in
accordance
with
the
president's
wishes
mccabe
who
now
serves
as
a
contributor
for
cnn
slammed
the
investigation
this
week
saying
he
absolutely
rejects
justice
department
inspector
general
michael
horowitz's
findings
and
conclusions
and
vowed
to
absolutely
not
take
a
plea
deal
under
any
circumstances
i
have
said
from
the
very
beginning
i
absolutely
reject
that
report
because
i
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
about
anything
and
i
will
not
stand
up
and
claim
that
i
have
done
something
that
i
didn't
do
so
it
won't
happen
