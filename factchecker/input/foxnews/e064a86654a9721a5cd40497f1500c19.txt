kamala
harris
d-calif
reiterated
her
call
for
the
impeachment
of
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
following
the
criticized
new
york
times
story
that
revived
sexual
misconduct
allegations
appearing
on
msnbc
monday
night
harris
referred
to
kavanaugh's
confirmation
as
a
sham
process
claiming
she
wasn't
given
all
of
the
information
at
the
time
that
was
available
christine
blasey
ford
who
literally
had
nothing
to
gain
by
coming
forward
nothing
to
gain
she
had
a
perfect
life
and
she
looked
at
the
fact
that
this
guy
was
being
nominated
and
said
the
american
people
had
the
right
to
know
what
i
know
and
she
was
treated
like
a
criminal
harris
said
the
hopeful
blasted
the
white
house
for
limiting
the
scope
of
the
fbi
investigation
into
kavanaugh
and
said
the
process
that
confirmed
him
has
created
a
crisis
of
confidence
in
that
court
trump
rips
new
york
times
over
kavanaugh
piece
calls
for
resignation
of
anyone
involved
in
smear
story
so
yes
i
call
for
impeachment
harris
told
msnbc
host
rachel
maddow
i
believe
that
is
the
clearest
way
for
us
to
get
an
investigation
of
these
allegations
and
we
should
open
an
investigation
of
these
allegations
she
added
that
the
american
people
and
the
system
of
justice
deserve
a
meaningful
investigation
and
later
suggested
an

the
fox
news
app
over
the
weekend
before
the
times
issued
the
major
revision
clarifying
that
the
alleged
accuser
did
not
recall
the
alleged
assault
harris
among
other
presidential
candidates
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
i
sat
through
those
hearings
brett
kavanaugh
lied
to
the
u.s.
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
he
must
be
impeached
