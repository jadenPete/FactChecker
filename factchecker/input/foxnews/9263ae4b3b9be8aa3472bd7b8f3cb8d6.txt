the
departure
of
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
this
week
was
the
culmination
of
months
of
sharp-elbowed
conflicts
between
the
foreign
policy
hawk
and
officials
at
all
levels
of
the
trump
administration
with
sources
saying
that
even
a
quietly
influential
aide
to
the
white
house
chief
of
staff
was
lobbying
for
his
ouster
president
trump
acknowledged
the
broader
conflicts
as
he
briefly
talked
with
reporters
about
the
unceremonious
exit
he
made
some
big
mistakes
john
wasn't
in
line
with
what
we
were
doing
trump
said
wednesday
in
the
oval
office
trump
recalled
that
he
told
bolton
you
aren't
getting
along
with
a
lot
of
people
and
a
lot
of
people
don't
like
your
tactics
and
your
ideas
and
i
would
like
you
to
resign
trump
ousts
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
says
they
disagreed
strongly
on
policy
bolton
disputes
trump's
version
of
events
maintaining
he
offered
to
resign
before
the
announcement
but
the
internal
tensions
were
on
full
display
in
the
aftermath
numerous
reports
have
emerged
of
clashes
over
a
range
of
issues
between
bolton
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
publicly
backed
trump's
decision
on
bolton
and
according
to
sources
close
to
the
administration
another
figure
rob
blair
who
serves
as
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney's
national
security
adviser
was
a
key
figure
in
bolton's
departure
blair
whose
position
isn't
a
formal
one
inside
the
white
house
has
worked
to
put
bolton
on
notice
while
using
his
connections
with
mulvaney
to
get
access
to
the
oval
office
sources
said
sources
close
to
the
matter
told
fox
news
that
blair
has
even
been
lobbying
trump
to
name
him
to
replace
bolton
however
he
does
not
enjoy
the
public
recognition
or
the
deep
national
security
resume
that
other
potential
candidates
have
trump
said
thursday
that
as
many
as
candidates
are
competing
for
the
job
before
joining
mulvaney's
staff
blair
was
an
associate
director
of
national
security
programs
at
the
office
of
management
and
budget
and
previously
worked
as
a
staffer
for
a
subcommittee
and
a
regional
adviser
for
the
state
department's
office
of
international
health
affairs
attempts
to
reach
blair
for
comment
were
not
successful
it
has
also
been
reported
that
bolton
frequently
clashed
with
pompeo
especially
over
a
plan
from
pompeo
and
trump
to
negotiate
a
peace
deal
with
the
taliban
in
afghanistan
and
withdraw
u.s.
troops
from
the
war-torn
nation
after
almost
years
of
conflict
bolton
argued
against
a
complete
troop
withdrawal
and
negotiations
with
the
terror
group
while
trump
ultimately
canceled
recent
talks
following
an
attack
that
left
a
u.s.
serviceman
dead
aides
in
support
of
negotiating
blamed
bolton
for
public
leaks
about
his
opposition
fevered
speculation
over
john
bolton's
replacement
as
national
security
adviser
the
secretary
of
state
also
reportedly
clashed
with
bolton
over
the
former's
softening
stance
toward
sanctions
against
iran
and
the
president
has
begun
to
drift
away
from
bolton's
hardline
stances
toward
global
hotspots
like
north
korea
and
venezuela
still
trump
maintained
thursday
that
he
not
bolton
held
the
hardline
stance
on
such
issues
tweeting
in
fact
my
views
on
venezuela
and
especially
cuba
were
far
stronger
than
those
of
john
bolton
he
was
holding
me
back
pompeo
has
remained
largely
quiet
about
bolton's
departure
from
the
influential
post
admitting
only
that
the
two
previously
had
disagreements
but
refusing
to
answer
questions
on
the
white
house's
inner
workings
there
were
many
times
ambassador
bolton
and
i
disagreed
that's
to
be
sure
pompeo
said
but
that's
true
for
lots
of
people
with
whom
i
interact
following
that
statement
pompeo
gave
a
wry
smile
which
one
official
close
to
the
secretary
of
state
told
the
washington
post
spoke
for
itself
meanwhile
pompeo
is
poised
to
exert
even
more
influence
on
foreign
policy
now
that
bolton
is
gone
pompeo
met
with
trump
on
thursday
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
him
even
assuming
the
role
of
national
security
adviser
on
top
of
his
current
position
this
would
follow
what
one
former
administration
official
described
as
the
kissinger
model
in
reference
to
when
henry
kissinger
served
in
both
roles
under
presidents
richard
nixon
and
gerald

afterward
that
this
option
is
being
ruled
out
he
told
reporters
pompeo
said
he
wants
someone
else
in
there
with
him
trump
said
a
decision
could
come

week
several
other

have
already
been
