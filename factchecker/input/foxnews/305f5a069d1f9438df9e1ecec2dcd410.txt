pentagon
officials
said
thursday
the
u.s.
would
defer
to
saudi
arabia's
assessment
of
responsibility
for
the
attack
before
making
any
moves
we're
going
to
work
through
with
the
saudis
as
they
make
their
assessment
of
what
took
place
we're
going
to
let
them
put
out
the
information
as
they
go
through
the
assessment
secretary
of
defense
for
public
affairs
jonathan
hoffman
told
reporters
we're
being
deliberative
about
this
and
we'll
wait
until
the
final
assessment
is
completed
with
the
saudis
and
they've
made

i
will
acknowledge
that
as
of
this
time
all
indications
are
we
have
that
iran
is
in
some
way
responsible
for
the
attack
on
the
saudi
refineries
joint
staff
spokesperson
air
force
col
patrick
s.
ryder
said
the
attacks
looked
more
sophisticated
than
the
houthis
have
been
capable
of
in
the
past
regardless
of
whether
this
was
a
proxy
or
direct
attack
by
iranian
forces
this
has
been
a
dramatic
escalation
of
what
we
have
seen
in
the
past
this
was
a
number
of
airborne
projectiles
it
was
very
sophisticated
and
coordinated
said
ryder
look
at
the
precision
obviously
it's
not
something
that
we've
necessarily
seen
in
the
past
from
houthi
attacks
