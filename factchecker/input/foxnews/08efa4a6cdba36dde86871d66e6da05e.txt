the
osc
filed
a
complaint
against
depaolo
in
june
accusing
her
of
violating
the
hatch
act
which
prohibits
federal
employees
from
engaging
in
political
activity
while
on
duty
or
in
the
federal
workplace
we
are
very
pleased
with
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
believe
the
significant
disciplinary
action
imposed
against
judge
depaolo
is
appropriate
and
warranted
special
counsel
henry
j.
kerner
said
in
a
statement
according
to
the
osc
depaolo
violated
the
hatch
act
as
she
presided
over
a
march
public
deportation
hearing
for
an
individual
facing
deportation
and
a
year
ban
on
reentry
into
the
united
states
the
judge
the
watchdog
said
called
that
punishment
a
pretty
harsh
thing
and
said
that
clinton
intended
to
change
that
if
she
won
if
democrats
won
the
senate
she
said
at
the
time
there's
some
hope
that
they
can
actually
pass
immigration
legislation

according
to
the

also
said
the
republicans
aren't
going
to
do
anything
about
immigration
if
they
can
help
it
other
than
try
to
deport
everybody
respondent's
actions
raises
the
specter
that
this
nation's
courtrooms
are
partisan
and
that
judges
consider
political
platforms
when
advising
litigants
the
very
nature
of
her
offense
politicizes
the
judiciary
and
the
federal
workforce
and
militates
toward
a
more
severe
sanction
the
decision
said
this
conduct
sends
a
bad
message
to
subordinates
and
possibly
instills
the
notion
that
political
activity
is
allowed
at
work
if
a
judge
can
say
it
from
the
bench

stops
other
employees
from
making
