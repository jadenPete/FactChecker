it's

played
fair

and

former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn's
legal
team
charged
in
court
tuesday
that
the
department
of
justice
cleared
flynn
of
being
a
russian
agent
in
a
memo
as
far
back
as
january
but
that
prosecutors
still
haven't
produced
the
document
the
claim
came
as
flynn's
lawyers
said
in
a
status
conference
in
a
washington
d.c.
courthouse
that
they
are
now
seeking
to
have
the
case
against
him
thrown
out
accusing
the
prosecution
of
egregious
conduct
and
suppression
of
possibly
exculpatory
evidence
we've
learned
that
there
was
a
letter
dated
january
th
or
an
internal
memo
from
the
department
of
justice
that
completely
exonerates
mr
flynn
of
being
an
agent
of
russia
and
that
document
has
not
been
produced
to
us
yet
lawyer
sidney
powell
said
according
to
a
transcript
of
tuesday's
hearing
obtained
by
fox
news
flynn
legal
team
accuses
prosecutors
of
misconduct
powell
continued
so
they
had
a
lot
of
information
that
they
didn't
disclose
they
also
have
knowledge
of
a
letter
from
the
british
embassy
that
completely
discredits
trump
dossier
author
christopher
steele
and
undoes
the
whole
steele
dossier
debacle
fox
news
learned
about
the
memo's
existence
last
week
asked
by
fox
news
earlier
this
week
if
they
were
aware
of
the
memo
and
could
provide
it
a
doj
official
said
they
would
try
to
identify
it
but
responding
to
powell's
concerns
in
court
on
tuesday
a
government
lawyer
said
they
were
irrelevant
noting
they
did
not
accuse
flynn
of
being
a
russian
agent
in
the
first
place

the
government
has
not
alleged
in
any
filings
in
this
court
or
before
the
court
that
the
defendant
is
an
agent
of
russia
that
is
not
part
of
this
case
that
is
not

of
the
act

has
pled

to
it

lying
to
the

about
particular
communications

russia
not
being
an
agent

prosecutor
brandon
van
grack
said
as
van
grack
noted
flynn
was
charged
and
dismissed
from
the
trump
administration
for
misleading
statements
about
his
conversations
with
then-russian
ambassador
to
the
u.s.
sergey
kislyak
but
new
developments
raise
questions
over
the
underlying
offense
that
formed
the
basis
for
the
initial
fbi
and
doj
investigation
into
flynn
aside
from
powell's
latest
claims
in
court
fox
news
reported
on
monday
that
then-deputy
fbi
director
andrew
mccabe
told
the
white
house
in
early
february
that
the
bureau
was
not
considering
flynn
for
a
potential
logan
act
prosecution
over
contacts
with
the
russian
ambassador
before
donald
trump
was
sworn
in
as
president
mccabe
was
referring
to
the
rarely
prosecuted
year-old
statute
that
bars
american
citizens
from
engaging
with
a
foreign
government
without
authorization
from
the
current
u.s.
government
the
records
also
indicated
that
flynn
reported
on
two
separate
occasions
in
the
days
leading
up
to
his
white
house
firing
that
fbi
agents
told
him
the
bureau
investigation
was
over
or
being
closed

flynn
was
never
charged
with
improperly
communicating
with
kislyak
but
in
december
pleaded
guilty
to
a
single
count
of
making
false
statements
as
part
of
a
plea
deal
with
prosecutors
powell
remarked
later
on
tuesday
at
the
hearing
there
never
would
have
been
a
plea
to
begin
with
if
the
government
had
met
its
brady
obligation
disclosing
what
it
knew
before
mr
flynn
entered
a
plea
and
frankly
before
he
even
made
a
proffer
andy
mccarthy
flynn
shouldn't
have
been
prosecuted
the
brady
material
complaint
is
in
reference
to
the
supreme
court
case
brady
v
maryland
which
established
the
government's
obligation
to
turn
over
all
exculpatory
evidence
the
accusation
came
as
both
sides
have
squabbled
over
a
sentencing
date
flynn's
defense
team
also
wants
all
the
documents
surrounding
the
fbi's
interview
of
flynn
prosecutors
claim
they
already
turned
all
those
documents
over
to
flynn's
team
prior
to
the
plea
deal
the
government
has
provided
all
drafts
of
that
interview
report
of
which
it
is
in

said

there

it

powell
said
powell
additionally
told
the
court
there
is
evidence
that
flynn
passed
a
polygraph
test
there
is
just
a
plethora
of

out
there
