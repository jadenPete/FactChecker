president
trump
nominated
a
slew
of
judges
friday
to
posts
on
california-based
federal
courts
ramping
up
efforts
to
reshape
the
judiciary
after
hitting
a
milestone
earlier
this
month
with
the
confirmation
of
the
th
federal
judge
on
his
watch
two
nominations
are
for
the
influential
san
francisco-based
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
a
long-liberal
bench
with
jurisdiction
across
the
american
west
whose
political
makeup
has
shifted
with
trump's
aggressive
appointment
campaign
trump
takes
on
california
over
fuel
economy
standards
among
the
nominees
is
patrick
bumatay
a
federal
prosecutor
in
the
southern
district
of
california
whom
trump
nominated
last
year
for
the
same
job
but
objections
from
california
democratic
sens
dianne
feinstein
and
kamala
harris
over
his
lack
of
judicial
experience
and
other
issues
derailed
the
nomination
trump
later
nominated
bumatay
who
is
openly
gay
to
a
district
court
seat
but
his
name
resurfaced
over
the
summer
for
a
possible
comeback
bid
for
the
ninth
circuit
amid
a
new
vacancy
while
it
is
traditional
for
a
nominee's
home-state
senators
to
give
their
approval
it
is
not
required
and
trump
lately
has
bypassed
the
so-called
blue
slip
tradition
in
order
to
get
conservative
judges
on
the
bench
while
democrats
have
fumed
at
the
tactics
conservatives
cheered
trump
this
month
for
seeing
the
th
federal
judge
confirmed
this
is
a
historic
milestone

said
in

the
senate
judiciary
committee
i
will
continue
to
push
through
highly
qualified
conservative
judges
at
all
levels
of
the
federal

graham
and
his
republican
allies
on
the

are
likely
to
be
receptive
to
trump's
latest
picks
trump
also
nominated
lawrence

official
and
former

and
its
job-killing
epa
trump
on
friday
announced
four
other
nominees
for
california
district
court
posts
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
a
focal
point
given
the
sprawling
territory
it
covers
and
its
record
in
decades
past
of
liberal-leaning
rulings
under
trump
the
court
has
shifted
more
moderate
with
the
addition
of
seven
trump-appointed
judges
nearly
half
of
the
seats
are
now
occupied
by
gop-appointed
judges
last
year
that
number
stood

hands
trump
win
on
asylum
policy
earlier
this
month
the
court
handed
trump
a
win
as
it
lifted
a
nationwide
injunction
on
his
controversial
asylum
policy
ruling
that
for
now
the
injunction
should
only
apply
to
states
within
the
circuit
trump
also
scored
a
victory
from
a
california
district
court
on
thursday
when
a
bush-appointed
judge
granted
a
request
to
block
for
now
a
law
requiring
presidential
candidates
to
release
tax
returns
in
order
to
run
in
the
state
primaries
democrats
though
have
accused
the
trump
administration
along
with
gop
allies
in
the
senate
of
destroying
congressional
custom
by
moving
past
consultations
with
home-state
senators
feinstein
in
a
floor
speech
over
the
summer
about
another
ninth
circuit
nomination
said
this
disregard
of
blue
slips
represents
another
breakdown
of
senate
traditions
she
said
screening
candidates
for
lifetime
appointments
to
ensure
they're
qualified
is
a
critical
task
and
warned
republicans
what
goes
round
comes
around
the
latest
nominations
also
come
amid
new
legal
battles
between
the

administration
and
california

in

to
set
strict

economy
standards
that
