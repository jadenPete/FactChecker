mayor
pete
buttigieg
lamented
that
the
bipartisan
spirit
in
the
country
after
was
fleeting
as
quickly
as
we
found
that
unity
it
slipped
from
our
grasp
common
ground
gave
way
to
fear
and
division
to
knee-jerk
infringements
on
our
freedom
and
a
self-defeating
invasion
of
iraq
he
said

old
buttigieg
noted
in
his
statement
marking
the
anniversary
that
he
was

those

who
slowed
the
renewal
of

fund
the
fund
created
after
the
terrorist
attacks
has
long
processed
claims
relating
to
injuries

deaths
caused

the

which
was
originally
slated

that
new

will
never
forget
those
who
are
only
there
for
us
one
day
a
year
leaders
in

spent
most
of
blatantly
forgetting
