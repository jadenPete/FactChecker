harder
one
week
after
he
abruptly
canceled
peace
talks
with
the
islamist
organization
killing
people
including
one
great
american
soldier
was
not
a
good
idea
trump
said
there
are
much
better
ways
to
set
up
a
negotiation
the
taliban
knows
they
made
a
big
mistake
and
they
have
no
idea
how
to
recover
the
message
came
hours
after
the
president
announced
that
the
son
of
usama
bin
laden
hamza
had
been
killed
in
a
recent
counterterrorism
operation

but
were
not
confirmed
until
the

saturday
statement
the

negotiations
what
kind
of
people
would
kill
so
many
in
order
to
seemingly
strengthen
their
bargaining
position
the
afghan
government
was
largely
shut
out
of
the
negotiations
and
concerned
that
any
finalized
u.s.
taliban
deal
would
delay
the
elections

from
happening
said
seddiqi
legitimacy
of
peace
cannot
be
achieved
without
elections
the
taliban
who
consider
the
afghan
government
a
u.s.
puppet
and
have
refused
to
hold
direct
talks
with
it
have
warned
afghans
not
to
vote
and
that
polling
stations
will
be
targets
sediqqi
said
that
the
afghan
government
has
suspended
its
own
peace
efforts
for
now
after
the
elections
the
progress
of
the
peace
process
would
be
a
priority
