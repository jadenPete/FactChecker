will
face

after
what
he
described
as
an
attempted
coup
to
take
down
president

the

will
address
concerns
with
whether
or
not
the

acted
improperly
in
obtaining
a
fisa
warrant
to
monitor

trump
campaign
adviser

in

of
their

the

a

mccarthy
told

sunday
morning
futures
i
respect
this
attorney
general
so
greatly
that
the
way
he
has
handled
this
he
believes
in
accountability
but
more
importantly
he
believes
in
the
rule
of
law
when
asked
if
there
will
really
be
accountability
mccarthy
promised
yes
james
comey
and
andrew
mccabe
who
were
the
director
and
deputy
director
of
the
fbi
when
the
russia
probe
began
have
been
the
subjects
of
separate
ig
investigations
and
mccarthy
believes
they
will
both
face
consequences
we
will
see
an
indictment
he
said
of
mccabe
who
is
facing
the
prospect
of
federal
charges
after
horowitz
faulted
him
in
a
separate
inquiry
over
statements
he
made
during
a
hillary
clinton-related
investigation
the
review
found
that
mccabe
lacked
candor
when
talking
with
investigators
but
the
former
fbi
official
has
denied
wrongdoing
washington

u.s.
attorney
jessie
liu
recommended
charges
against
mccabe
after
the

rejected
his
appeal
us
attorney
recommends
proceeding
with
charges
against
mccabe
as
doj
rejects
last-ditch
appeal
comey
was
chastised
in
a
recent
report
from
horowitz
that
discussed
how
comey
improperly
maintained
records
of
his
conversations
with
president
trump
and
leaked
sensitive
information
about
the
investigation
of
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
while
the
report
found
that
comey
violated
department
policy
the
doj
opted
not
to
press
charges
mccarthy
believes
that
there
will
be
more
to
come
for
comey
in
the
end
i
do
not
believe
that
jim
comey
will
get
off
mccarthy
predicted
adding
anyone
that
has
had
any
association
with
trying
to
create
this
coup
should
be
held
accountable
after
president
trump
fired
comey

director
of

mccabe's
tenure
