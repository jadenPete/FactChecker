mark
morgan
says
the
white
house
is
utilizing
every
legal
tool
possible
to
stop
the
border
crisis
while
congress
sits
on
their
hands
laredo
texas
acting
customs
and
border
protection
commissioner
mark
morgan
accused
reckless
members
of
congress
of
lying
in
their
attacks
on
agents
on
the
ground
who
are
enforcing
u.s.
immigration
law
saying
it
is
hurting
morale
and
lawmakers
should
instead
get
to
work
fixing
the
loopholes
in
the
immigration
system
that
he
says
are
responsible
for
the
crisis
at
the
border
when
you're
there
every
single
day
and
you're
risking
your
lives
and
you're
doing
so
with
humanity
and
compassion
and
yet
the
very
people
who
are
elected
leaders
are
attacking
your
character
yeh
sure
it
has
an
impact
on
morale
he
said
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
this
week
between
meetings
with
agents
at
the
border
that's
what
they
tell
me
and
the
leaders
in
the
field
are
saying
the
same
thing
inside
trump's
immigration
tent
courts
controversial
system
meant
to
fast-track
asylum
backlog
morgan
who
has
served
in
both
the
obama
and
trump
administrations
did
not
mention
any
lawmakers
by
name
or
party
affiliation
but
referred
to
comments
made
by
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
who
has
described
detention
centers
as
concentration
camps
and
has
accused
officials
of
forcing
migrants
to
drink
water
from
toilets
when
he
recalled
those
remarks
morgan
became
visibly
angry
at
what
he
called
the
lies
being
aimed
at
agents
on
the
frontlines
of
the
crisis
and
didn't
hold
back
in
his
criticism
of
those
responsible
for
spreading
the
claims
it
hasn't
just
been
a
false
narrative
it's
a
lie
he
said
i
mean
when
someone
says
we're
running
concentration
camps
it's
a
lie
it's
not
just
a
false
narrative
it's
a
lie
when
someone
says
border
patrol
agents
are
forcing
people
to
drink
from
a
toilet
it's
not
a
false
narrative
it's
a
lie
he
noted
that
cbp
has
conducted
more
than
rescues
this
year
something
he
says
isn't
publicized
by
the
media
enough
as
agents
risk
their
lives
in
treacherous
waters
and
blistering
degree
heat
to
save
the
lives
of
migrants
trying
to
enter
the
u.s.
he
gave
one
harrowing
story
of
cartel
smugglers
who
seeing
cbp
agents
approaching
threw
a
paraplegic
man
into
the
river
so
they
wouldn't
be
apprehended
agents
quickly
dove
into
the
water
and
saved
the
man's
life
you
never
hear
about
that
instead
you
hear
these
lies
that
they're
running
concentration
camps
or
they
call
them
nazis
he
said
but
let
me
ask
you
this
if
we're
an
organization
full
of
nazis
how
do
you
explain
rescues
how
do
you
explain
the
countless
individuals
that
come
to
our
custody
sick
or
with
pre-existing
life-threatening
conditions
and
we
do
everything
we
can
to
save
their
lives
and
that's
what
gets
me
so
frustrated
about
our
own
elected
officials
he
said
trump
administration
signs
asylum
agreement
with
el
salvador
acting
customs
and
border
protection
commissioner
mark
morgan
speaks
to
agents
in
laredo
texas
adam
shaw
fox
news
if
they
don't
like
it
change
the
laws
but
instead
because
they
can't
do
their
job
because
they
can't
get
their
act
together
to
do
what
they
need
to
safeguard
and
secure
this
country
they
vilify
the
men
and
women
of
customs
and
border
protection
and
that's
outrageous
it's
reckless
and
it's
irresponsible
morgan
said
morgan's
remarks
came
after
the
new
york
times
published
a
story
outlining
border
patrol's
morale
crisis
that
detailed
how
morale
has
plummeted
amid
the
myriad
of
attacks
against
them
including
how
agents
have
to
pick
their
restaurants
carefully
when
in
uniform
in
case
someone
spits
in
their
food
agents
interviewed
by
the
times
spoke
about
how
their
job
had
also
gone
from
stopping
drug
smugglers
to
taking
care
of
children
and
giving
them
formula
as
the
nature
of
the
crisis
at
the
border
has
changed
morgan
told
fox
that
agents
know
that
when
they
are
pulled
off
the
frontlines
it
is
making
the
u.s.
less
secure
they
know
every
minute
they're
pulled
away
to
take
care
of
a
child
to
order
baby
formula
to
change
diapers
to
act
as
a
quasi-social
worker
in
an
environment
for
the
kids
and
families
they're
pulled
off
the
frontline
and
they
know
bad
people
and
bad
things
are
getting
through
he
said
but
they
would
still
do
that
and
do
that
with
pride
what
really
gets
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
that
vitriol
that
rhetoric
that's
coming
from
congress
that's
attacking
who
they
are
and
their
character
that's
what
really
gets
morale
down
morgan
was
one
of
a
number
of
administration
officials
who
was
in
laredo
this
week
to
meet
with
officials
and
visit
the
migrant
protection
protocol
mpp
courtrooms
that
allows
asylum
seekers
to
stay
in
mexico
while
their
cases
are
processed
it's
one
of
a
number
of
measures
taken
by
the
trump
administration
that
officials
are
crediting
for
a
sharp
drop
in
border
apprehensions
in
august
migrants
were
apprehended
at
the
border
a
number
that
officials
say
is
still
too
high
but
marks
a
percent
drop
from
the
highs
of
may
additionally
efforts
to
build
more
miles
of
wall
on
the
southern
border
something
that
many
agents
say
is
a
top
priority
in
places
such
as
laredo
are
underway
the
administration
is
promising
that
the
pace
of
construction
is
increasing
and
that
as
much
as
miles
of
new
wall
will
be
built
by
the
end
of
click

to
get
the
fox
news
app
but
with
those
measures
taking
effect
officials
are
keeping
their
attention
on
congress
saying
that
laws
to
close
loopholes
in
the
law
are
needed
in
order
to
stop
the
pull
factors
that
are
still
enticing
migrants
to
make
the
dangerous
and
often
deadly
journey
north
when
asked
what
he
wanted
congress
to
do
specifically
morgan
didn't
need
a
moment
to
think
quickly
rattling
off
a
series
of
measures
he
says
are
needed
at
the
frontline
a
permanent
fix
to
the
flores
court
settlement
that
limits
how
long
children
can
be
detained
changes
to
the
trafficking
victims
protection
reauthorization
act
tvpra
that
prevents
the
u.s.
from
returning
some
children
to
their
home
countries
a
fix
to
the
credible
fear
barrier
for
asylum
claims
and
for
enforcement
agencies
to
be
given
more
funding
to
do
their
jobs
but
given
the
sharp
partisan
divide
in
washington
morgan
isn't
hopeful
that
agents
will
get
any
help
from
the
halls
of
congress
any
time
soon
they
could
do
that
in
minutes
on
one
page
if
they
would
actually
get
together
and
do
their
job
he
said
but
they
won't
i've
spoken
to
many
of
them
and
they're
telling
me
its
not
going
to
happen
and
that's
what's
so
frustrating
