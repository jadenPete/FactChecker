told

that
he
and
ohio

plan
to
make
a
referral
to
him
about
inconsistencies
in
what
comey
has
said
about
opening
up
an
obstruction
case
against
president
trump
i'm
finding
just
a
number
of
irregularities
meadows
said
so
would
it
be
appropriate
if
ranking
member
jordan
and
i
were
to
refer
those
inconsistencies
to
the
ig
and
if
we
did
that
with
the
ig
look
at
those
inconsistencies
horowitz
replied
it's
certainly
appropriate
for
us
to
get
a
referral
about
a
then-employee
of
the
department
meadows
told
horowitz
he
believes
comey
gave
conflicting
information
when
his
closed-door
testimony
in
december
is
compared
against
what's
in
horowitz's
latest
report
that
report
released
last
month
found
that
comey
violated
bureau
policies
by
drafting
leaking
and
retaining
memos
documenting
private
discussions
with
trump
meadows
said
comey
told
lawmakers
he
denied
initiating
an
obstruction-of-justice
investigation
because
of
comments
the
president
made
to
him
but
the
inspector
general's
report
on
comey
said
the
former
fbi
director
purposely
leaked
his
memos
of
those
conversations
with
trump
to
spark
a
special
counsel
investigation
of
alleged
obstruction
andrew
mccabe
blasts
doj
criminal
probe
vows
not
to
take

so
two
of
those
can't
be
true
meadows
said
he
added
so
we'll
be
referring
those
inconsistencies
to
you
today
mr
horowitz
special
counsel
robert
mueller
opted
against
drawing
a
conclusion
on
whether
the
president
obstructed
investigators
work
in
the
russia
probe
wednesday's
hearing
was
billed
as
a
forum
to
examine
the
community
of
inspectors
general
their
resources
and
ongoing
work
many
lawmakers
focused
questions
on
horowitz's
reviews
related
to
the
fbi
and
justice
department
horowitz
was
asked
to
elaborate
on
his
report
saying
comey
set
a
dangerous
example
though
his
memo
leaks
our
concern
was
empowering
fbi
directors
or
frankly
any
fbi
employee
or
other
law
enforcement
official
with
the
authority
to
decide
that
they're
not
going
to
follow
established
norms
and
procedures
because
in
their
view
they've
made
a
judgment
that
the
individuals
they're
dealing
with
can't
be
trusted
he
said
last
week
horowitz
told
lawmakers
his
team
is
nearly
finished
with
a
hotly
anticipated
review
of
alleged
surveillance
abuses
by
the
doj
and
fbi
during
the
russia
investigation
saying
that
a
draft
was
sent
to
attorney
general
bill
barr
and
that
the
report
is
being
finalized
ahead
of
a
public
release
horowitz
and
his
investigators
have
probed
how
the
infamous
and
salacious
anti-trump
dossier
compiled
by
former
british
spy
christopher
steele
was
used
to
secure
a
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act
fisa
warrant
for
former
trump
aide
carter
page
in
october
as
well
as
three
fisa
renewals
horowitz's
team
has
questioned
why
the
fbi
considered
steele
a
credible
source
and
why
the
bureau
seemed
to
use
news
reports
to
bolster
steele's
credibility
doj
uses
democrats
impeachment
confusion
against
them
in
court
in
his
letter
friday
horowitz
indicated
that
once
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
send
back
a
marked
document
relating
to
classified
material
his
team
will
proceed
with
our
usual
process
for
preparing
final
draft
public
and
classified
reports
and
ensuring
that
appropriate
reviews
occur
for
accuracy
and
comment
purposes
meanwhile
a
key
fbi
player
during
the
time
frame
under
scrutiny
former
fbi
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
is
facing
the
prospect
of
federal
charges
after
horowitz
faulted
him
in
a
separate
inquiry
over
statements
he
made
during
a
hillary
clinton-related
investigation
the
review
found
that
mccabe
lacked
candor
when
talking
with
investigators
but
the
former
fbi
official
has
denied
wrongdoing
