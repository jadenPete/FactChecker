the
trump
administration
on
friday
signed
an
asylum
cooperative
agreement
with
el
salvador
that
would
mean
migrants
who
pass
through
that
country
need
to
have
first
sought
and
been
denied
asylum
there
before
continuing
to
the
u.s.
it
marked
the
latest
in
a
rapid-fire
series
of
moves
by
the
administration
to
tackle
the
migrant
crisis
at
the
southern
border
the
agreement
was
signed
by
acting
department
of
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
and
el
salvador's
foreign
minister
alexandra
hill
with
both
officials
saying
it
was
a
sign
of
better
relations
between
the
two
countries
since
the
pro-u
s.
president
nayib
bukele
took
office
earlier
this
year
specifics
of
the
agreement
were
not
immediately
available

controversial

means
to
fast-track
asylum
backlog
as
you
all
know
irregular
immigration
has
been
an
issue
for
the
last
odd
years
and
now
we've
reached
levels
where
it
is
extremely
important
that
both
the
u.
s
and
el
salvador
deal
with
this
issue
conjointly
hill
said
she
said
the
agreement
includes
items
of
information
sharing
and
biometrics
as
well
as
help
in
resettling
returning
migrants
this
will
build
on
the
good
work
we
have
accomplished
already
with
el
salvador's
neighbor
guatemala
in
building
protection
capacity
to
try
and
further
our
efforts
to
provide
opportunities
to
seek
protection
for
political
racial
religious
or
social
group
persecution
as
close
as
possible
to
the
origin
of
individuals
that
need

he
added
that
since
bukele
took
office
apprehensions
of
el
salvadorans
at
the
u.s.
southern
border
had
dropped
percent
and
that
that
country's
government
has
put
a
further
immigration
agents
and
police
officers
to
patrol
the
country's
border
he
said
the
government
has
made
good
on
its
promises
of
greater
cooperation
with
the
u.s.
the
core
of
it
is
recognizing
el
salvador's
development
of
their
own
asylum
system
and
a
commitment
to
help
them
build
that
capacity
he
said
the
pact
would
be
similar
to
that
signed
in
july
with
guatemala
yet
to
be
fully
implemented
that
would
require
migrants
who
cross
into
the
country
to
apply
for
protection
there
instead
of
at
the
border
the
administration
has
also
forged
an
agreement
with
mexico
that
has
seen
that
country
up
its
number
of
troops
at
the
border
and
the
expansion
of
the
migrant
protection
protocols
by
which
migrants
are
sent
to
mexico
to
await
their
immigration
hearings
officials
have
touted
the
diplomacy
as
a
primary
factor
in
the
sharp
drop
in
migrant
apprehensions
at
the
border
over
the
summer
migrants
were
apprehended
in
august
a
drop
of
percent
since
may
that
international
effort
is
making
an
impact
mexican
operational
interdiction
is
certainly
the
highlight
of
that
effort
but
the
shared
responsibility
we're
seeing
in
the
region
governments
stepping
up

hails

pact
however
many
of
the
moves
have
been
controversial
with
democratic
lawmakers
and
immigrant
rights
groups
and
a
pact
with
el
salvador
is
likely
to
be
met
with
further
outrage
el
salvador
is
one
of
central
america's
most
violent
countries
and
any
agreement
that
would
keep
migrants
there
is
almost
certainly
likely
to
be
decried
by
critics
as
one
that
puts
migrants
in
danger

has
also
made
agreements
with
central

countries
including
el

on
issues
such
as
human
smuggling
and
border
security
a
senior

official
told

last
week
that

has
so

more
than
doubled
its

force
after
the

requested

last
month
where
he
signed
a
letter
of
of
intent
with
four
elements
of
possible
collaboration
with
the
el
salvadoran
government
the
administration
also
scored
a
significant
win
at
the
supreme
court
last
week
when
the
court
allowed
the
administration's
rule
banning
migrants
who
had
crossed
through
other
countries
from
claiming
asylum
in
the
u.s.
that
move
would
make

migrants
from
countries
south
of
the
border
other
than
mexico
ineligible
for
asylum
in
