says
she's
not

democratic
rep
al
green
one
of
the
most
vocal
advocates
for
impeachment
complained
thursday
that
his
colleagues
latest
resolution
establishing
that
process
didn't
include
accusations
of
discrimination
against
president
trump
the
house
judiciary
committee
voted
earlier
to
essentially
formalize
an
impeachment
investigation
but
with
committee
democrats
largely
focused
on
allegations
of
obstruction
of
justice
and
other
issues
texas
rep
green
lamented
it
doesn't
go
far
enough
pelosi
lashes
out
at
reporters
on
impeachment
i
think
we're
moving
in
the
right
direction
but
i
was
disappointed
that
they
didn't
cover
some
other
aspects
of
impeachment
especially
those
that
deal
with
invidious
discrimination
green
told
fox
news
on
the
sidelines
of
the
democratic
presidential
primary
debate
on
thursday
night
in
houston
green
was
the
first
democrat
to
introduce
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
on
the
house
floor
in
he
has
repeatedly
introduced
articles
since
and
the
house
has
repeatedly
voted
against
passage
all
of
the
articles
that
i've
actually
called
to
the
attention
of
the
house
that
we
have
voted
on
were
articles
that
have
dealt
with
discrimination
emanating
from
the
presidency
he
said
referring
to
the
president's
comments
referring
to
sh-
hole
countries
and
his
rhetoric
surrounding
the
riots
in
charlottesville
va
in
when
the
president
said
there
were
very
fine
people
that
was
not
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
because
of
the
way
that
impacts
other
persons
in
society
and
cause
them
to
conclude
that
maybe
they
can
do
things
they
shouldn't

call
green
stopped
short
of
likening
trump
to
recent
mass
shooters
who
have
used
violent
and
hateful
rhetoric
saying
you
can't
draw
a
line
between
trump
and
a
shooter
but
he
did
use
language
very
similar
more
than
half
of
house
democrats
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
including
members
of
the
judiciary
committee
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
has
long
expressed
skepticism
about
impeachment
urging
democrats
to
focus
on
their
legislative
agenda
instead
but
when
asked
by
fox
news
this
week
if
she
supported
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
pelosi
said
yes
i
do
house
dems
move
on
impeachment
i
think
you
should
characterize
it
for
what
it
is
it's
a
continuation
of
what
we
have
been
doing
she
said
you
know
we
all
work
together
on
these
things
the
committee's
move
to
intensify
its
impeachment
investigation
comes
after
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
mueller
determined
there
was
not
evidence
sufficient
to
charge
anyone
associated
with
the
trump
campaign
with
criminal
conspiracy
to
coordinate
with
the
russian
government
during
the
election
the
initial
basis
for
the
probe
but
democrats
have
turned
to
other
issues
including
trump's
finances
and
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
all
those
things
are
on
the
table
obviously
but
they
did
not
put
invidious
discrimination
on
the
table
green
said
adding
that
he
absolutely
believes
it
should
be
included
meanwhile
from
the
white
house
friday
morning
the
president
questioned
how
impeachment
could
even
be
an
option
touting
his
record
how
do
you
impeach
a
president
who
has
helped
create
perhaps
the
greatest
economy
in
the
history
of
our
country
all
time
best
unemployment
numbers
especially
for
blacks
hispanics
asians
women
more
people

mueller
testimony
james
comey
ig
report
which
showed
him
to
be
a
disgraced
dirty
cop
he
added
republicans
have
unified
like
never
before
you
don't
impeach
presidents
for
doing
a
good
great
job
no
obstruction
no
collusion
only
treasonous
crimes
committed
by
the
other
side
and
led
by
the
democrats
