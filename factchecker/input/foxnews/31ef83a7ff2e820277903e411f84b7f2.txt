to
release
the
transcript
of
his
call
with
the
ukraine
former
vice
president
joe
biden
went
on
the
offense
saturday
over
president
trump's
july
phone
call
with
the
president
of
ukraine
in
which
trump
reportedly
urged
the
leader
to
investigate
biden's
son's
dealings
in
the
country
with
biden
backing
calls
for
a
house
investigation
and
for
the
white
house
to
release
the
transcript
of
the
call
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
he
told
reporters
in
iowa
new
details
reported
on
trump-ukraine
call
as
dems
clash
with
white
house
on
complaint
the
wall
street
journal
reported
friday
that
in
a
july
phone
call
trump
repeatedly
asked
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
to
work
with
trump
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
on
a
probe
into
hunter
biden
joe
biden
now
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
has
faced
scrutiny
for
months
over
his
role
as
vp
in
pressuring
the
country
to
fire
its
top
prosecutor
while
he
was
leading
a
corruption
investigation
into
a
natural
gas
company
that
had
ties
to
hunter
giuliani
has
suggested
that
biden
as
vice
president
worked
to
protect
the
company
from
investigation
on
saturday
biden
said
that
he
had
never
spoken
to
hunter
about
his
business
dealings
in
ukraine
and
backed
calls
for
the
house
to
investigate
as
well
as
suggesting
it
could
begin
a
path
to
impeachment
depending
on
what
the
house
finds
he
could
be
impeached
but
i'm
not
making
that
judgment
now
he
said
the
house
should
investigate
it
this
appears
to
be
an
overwhelming
abuse
of
power
he
went
on
to
call
trump
a
serial
abuser
he
abuses
power
everywhere
he
can
and
if
he
sees
any
threat
to
staying
in
power
he'll
do
whatever
he
has
to
do
but
this
crosses
the
line
he
said
controversy
over
trump
phone
call
centers
on
ukraine
as
president
decries
partisan
complaint
biden's
remarks
came
just
hours
after
trump
dismissed
the
controversy
as
a
ukraine
witch
hunt
being
stoked
by
the
democratic
party
and
the
fake
news
media
and
said
that
the
real
scandal
was
to
do
with
biden's
interactions
in
the
country
the
fake
news
media
and
their
partner
the
democrat
party
want
to
stay
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
joe
biden
demand
that
the
ukrainian
government
fire
a
prosecutor
who
was
investigating
his
son
or
they
won't
get
a
very
large
amount
of
u.s.
money
so
they
fabricate
a
story
about
me
and
a
perfectly
fine
and
routine
conversation
i
had
with
the
new
president
of
the
ukraine
he
tweeted
nothing
was
said
that
was
in
any
way
wrong
but
biden's
demand
on
the
other
hand
was
a
complete
and
total
disaster
the
fake
news
knows
this
but
doesn't
want
to
report
what
initially
touched
off
the
controversy
is
a
secret
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
director
of
national
intelligence
has
kept
from
congress
reportedly
involving
a
promise
trump
made
to
an
unnamed
foreign
leader
trump
dismissed
the
story
as
ridiculous
and
a
partisan
hack
job
from
the
oval
office
on
friday
and
said
his
calls
with
foreign
leaders
are
always
appropriate
the
whistleblower
complaint
led
house
intelligence
committee
adam
schiff
d-calif
and
other
democrats
to
call
for
an
investigation
and
for
the
administration
hand
over
the
complaint
as
well
as
a
transcript
of
the
call
even
as
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
declined
to
share
details
with
lawmakers
maguire
is
expected
to
testify
publicly
about
the
whistleblower
complaint
on
sept
after
being
subpoenaed
by
the
house
intelligence
committee
schiff
had
accused
maguire
of
withholding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
and
questioned
whether
he
had
been
directed
to
do
so
by
the
white
house
or
the
attorney
general

trump
said
that
the
media
was
turning
the
story
into
one
about
him
as
they
are
trying
to
protect
the
democratic
frontrunner
now
that
the
democrats
and
the
fake
news
media
have
gone
bust
on
every
other
of
their
witch
hunt
schemes
they
are
trying
to
start
one
just
as
ridiculous
as
the
others
call
it

at

time
trying
