biden

a
reflection

both
of

the

differences

in

than

democrats
on
thursday
took
a
big
step
in
their
trump
impeachment
push
as
they
set
the
ground
rules
for
a
formal
committee
inquiry
but
republicans
laughed
it
off
as
a
giant
instagram
filter
to
hide
how
divided
democrats
truly
are
on
the
question
the
committee
voted
to
define
the
rules
for
future
committee
impeachment
hearings
the
committee
is
not
writing
articles
of
impeachment
and
nothing
is
going

the
floor
of
the
house
right
now
but
the
session
still
holds

the

the

has

the
judge's

freedom

and
the
nra
this
week
fox
news
senior
judicial
analyst
judge
andrew
napolitano
explains
why
the
government
has
the
freedom
of
speech
we
know
from
the
plain
language
in
and
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
that
all
persons
have
the
freedom
of
speech
but
what
about
the
government
the
short
answer
to
it
is
under
the
theory
of
the
declaration
of
independence
that
our
rights
come
to
us
from
the
creator
and
are
inalienable
and
consistent
with
madison's
understanding
the
government
has
no
freedom
of
speech
whatever
one
thinks
of
the
nra
the
government
has
no
business
condemning
it
can
it
condemn
mcdonald's
as
a
health
menace
for
selling
fatty
foods
can
it
condemn
the
free
press
as
a
public
enemy
when
the
press
criticizes
it
the
answer
to
all
these
hypotheticals
is
no
the
first
amendment
was
written
to
keep
the
government
out
of
the
business
of
influencing

while
i
am
not
a
fan
of

i
greatly
admire
the
quote
you
included
from
justice
ginsberg
on
wednesday
i
recall
as
a
boy
growing
up
in
northern
mi
in
the
s
s
with
all
four
grandparents
alive
and
how
that
generation
absolutely
abhorred
any
racial
minority
and
all
non-protestant
religions
and
were
quite
vocal
about
it
often
in
front
of
us
kids
we
the
kids
thought
mostly
nothing
of
those
utterances
b
c
we
were
growing
up
in
the
age
of
the
television
and
could
see
for
ourselves
what
was
happening
in
our
country
relative
to
the
quest
for
tolerance
our
parents
were
less
vocal
but
none-the-less
had
a
detectable
level
of
intolerance
in
the
same
vein
as
the
family
elders
as
the
of
us
matriculated
in
the
late
s
very
early
s
me
to
a
long
navy
career
where
i
was
in
all
parts
of
the
world
my
brother
to
law
school
then
a
long
legal
career
where
he
saw
just
about
everything
my
sisters
to
other
parts
of
the
country
with
their
families
where
things
were
very
ethnically
religiously
diverse
i'm
not
saying
specifically
that
we
had
a
part
in
getting
together
to
help
bring
about
change
but
i
think
the
boomer
generation
including
us
had
a
huge
role
in
working
in
a
like-minded
fashion
to
make
change
over
the
past
decades
or
so
i
guess
my
point
is
i
don't
see
much
credit
given
to
the
boomers
as
a
generation
for
pushing
the
tolerance
envelope

we've

to

years
about

consequences
from

but
that
in
no
way
diminishes
our
gratitude
for
the
fact
that
in
your
time
americans
did
so
much
to
achieve
the
vision
of
the
founders
of
a

centered
on
the

individuals
