long-simmering
policy
disputes
between
joe
biden
bernie
sanders
elizabeth
warren
and
a
slew
of
other
candidates
exploded
into
the
open
during
thursday
night's
democratic
primary
debate
as
the
candidates
often
with
raised
voices
laid
bare
their
fundamental
disagreements
on
medicare-for-all
immigration
and
more
intermittent
efforts
by
some
candidates
to
show
unity
and
keep
the
heat
on
president
trump
repeatedly
failed
with
most
striving
instead
to
score
an
aggressive
debate
moment
onstage
in
houston
amid
the
melee
pete
buttigieg
offered
an
exit
ramp
from
the
feuding
as
he
criticized
the
democrats
for
scoring
points
against
each
other
prompting
julian
castro
to
interject
that's
called
an
election
yeah
but
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
amy
klobuchar
retorted
to
no
avail
the
economy
which
has
performed
well
by
virtually
all
major
metrics
in
the
past
year
went
largely
undiscussed
during
the
raucous
three-hour
debate
and
even
as
house
democrats
made
a
push
towards
potentially
impeaching
the
president
this
week
that
topic
conspicuously
did
not
come
up
either
the
brouhaha
at
the
abc
news-hosted
debate
began
from
the
outset
when
biden
set
the
tone
by
going
after
warren
directly
i
know
the
senator
says
she's
for
bernie
biden
said
well
i'm
for
barack
for
a
socialist
you've
got
a
lot
more
confidence
in
corporate
america
than
i
do
biden
shot
back
at
sanders
shortly
afterward
after
the
u.s.
senator
from
vermont
suggested
corporations
would
return
the
money
they
currently
make
on
high
insurance
premiums
if
his
sweeping
plan
were
implemented
sanders
responded
by
referring
to
cancer
treatment
leading
biden
to
sharply
reply
i
know
a
lot
about
cancer
it's
personal
to
me
brain
cancer
killed
biden's
son
beau
four
years
ago
the
clashes
settled
any
questions
about
whether
the
top-tier
candidates
meeting
onstage
for
the
first
time
with
the
addition
of
warren
would
hold
back
to
the
contrary
biden
was
clearly
mindful
that
warren
has
been
surging
in
recent
weeks
and
was
ready
to
fight
to
hold
his
frontrunner
status
while
several
candidates
continued
to
pile
on
biden
as
they
have
at
past
debates
but
the
most
heated
clashes
of
the
night
came
between
biden
and
fellow
obama
administration
member
castro
who
tangled
at
length
in
direct
and
seemingly
personal
terms
i'm
fulfilling
the
legacy
of
barack
obama
and
you're
not
castro
said
referring
to
the
millions
of
americans
who
lack
health
coverage
leading
biden
to
respond
that'll
be
a
surprise
to
him
castro
hammered
biden
for
claiming
that
individuals
would
not
be
required
to
buy
into
his
health
care
plan
in
order
to
receive
coverage
you
just
said
two
minutes
ago
they
would
have
to
buy
in
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
asked
some
commentators
said
castro's
jab
was
an
improper
thinly
veiled
reference
to
biden's
age
however
biden
did
not
say
during
the
debate
that
individuals
would
have
to
buy
in
instead
biden
said
that
individuals
would
automatically
be
enrolled
if
they
lost
their
jobs
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
biden
had
said
if
you
lose
the
job
from
your
insurance
company
from
your
employer
you
automatically
can
buy
into
this
biden
responded
correctly
as
the
crowd
roared
in
support
of
castro
that
he
had
said
that
people
would
be
automatically
enrolled
under
his
plan
later
on
during
a
discussion
on
immigration
castro
hit
biden
for
distancing
himself
from
barack
obama's
record
when
it
suited
him
only
to
emphasize
his
tenure
as
vice
president
when
it
was
beneficial
he
wants
to
take
credit
for
obama's
work
but
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
castro
charged
i
stand
with
barack
obama
all
eight
years
good
bad
and
indifferent
biden
said
i
did
not
say
i
did
not
stand
with
him

stacey

biden
meanwhile
drilled
warren
and
sanders
for
refusing
to
directly
answer
whether
taxes
would
go
up
under
their
preferred
medicare-for-all
proposal
the
only
question
here
in
terms
of
difference
is
where
to
send
the
bill
warren
eventually
offered
she
added
we
all
owe
a
huge
debt
to
president
obama
who
fundamentally
transformed
health
care
in
america
and
committed
this
country
to
health
care
for
every
human
being
and
now
the
question
is
how
best
can
we
improve
on
it
what's
that
in
the
sky
over
the
debate
it's
a
bird
no
it's
a
plane
from
the
trump
campaign
warren
maintained
that
she
had
never
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
what
they
want
is
access
to
health
care
sanders
his
voice
rising
repeated
a
familiar
line
in
defense
of
his
medicare-for-all
plan
against
supposed
distortions
by
his
opponents
saying
i
wrote
the
damn
bill
maybe
you
have
run
into
people
who
love
their
premiums

snapped

later
to
applause
klobuchar
who
does
not
support
medicare-for-all
maintained
that
millions
would
lose
their
private
coverage
sen
kamala
harris
meanwhile
insisted
she
had
always
supported
sanders
health
care
plan
even
as
she
has
publicly
waffled
as
to
what
would
happen
to
private
insurance
plans
if
she
were
elected
she
has
said
all
private
health
care
plans
would
be
eliminated
as
sanders
prefers
only
to
quickly
walk
back
that
idea
tensions
were
evident
both
on
and
off
the
stage
toward
the
end
of
the
debate
a
group
of
protesters
interrupted
biden
for
nearly
a
minute
just
before
he
began
speaking
about
personal
tragedies
in
his
life
including
the
death
of
his
first
wife
and
daughter
in
biden
also
repeated
the
inaccurate
claim
that
children
were
not
kept
in
cages
under
the
obama
administration
the
most
widely
circulated
photo
of
children
in
cages
in
immigration
detention
centers
though
falsely
attributed
to
the
trump
era
was
in
fact
taken
during
obama's
presidency
biden
ridiculed
for
saying
nonviolent
criminals
like
white-collar
offenders
should
never
receive
prison
time
the
former
vice
president
also
seemingly
made
a
bungled
and
anachronistic
appeal
to
technology
urging
attendees
play
the
radio
make
sure
the
television
excuse
me
make
sure
you
have
the
record
player
on
at
night
the
phone
that
response
came
after
a
question
about
what
americans
can
do
to
help
roll
back
the
legacy
of
slavery
biden
was
suggesting
that
children
need
to
hear
words
outside
of
the
school
environment
to
improve
their
vocabulary
then
when
a
moderator
tried
to
cut
off
his
lengthy
answer
biden
fired
back
no
i'm
gonna
go
like
the
rest
of
them
do
twice
over
in
another
head-turning
moment
during
a
discussion
on
criminal
justice
reform
biden
suggested
that
nonviolent
crimes
should
never
result
in
prison
time
nobody
should
be
in
jail
for
a
non-violent
crime
biden
said
when
we
were
in
the
white
house
we
released
people
from
the
federal
prison
system
but
before
all
the
battles
got
underway
the
debate
immediately
brought
about
a
bizarre
moment
early
on
when
longshot
candidate
andrew
yang
revealed
he
would
randomly
give
families
that
registered
on
his
website
per
month
what
he
called
a
freedom
dividend
the
plan
prompted
a
sustained
moment
of
silence
from
buttigieg
who
took
several
seconds
to
begin
his
own
opening
statement
once
yang
finished
and
eventually
said
that's
original
i'll
give
it
that
yang's
debate
surprise
he's
giving
away
g
to
random
families
stunning
candidates
on
stage
some
suggested
the
plan
might
even
violate
campaign-finance
laws
yang
has
advanced
a
plan
to
give
every
american
at
least
per
month
if
elected

taxpayer
funds

his

performance
universal
income
proposal
for
the
other
candidates
the
evening
offered
an
opportunity
for
an
electric
moment
and
a
potential
momentum
boost
harris
sustained
attack
on
biden's
decades-old
opposition
to
federally
required
busing
during
the
june
primary
debate
gained
her
the
nation's
attention
even
as
critics
said
she
had
mischaracterized
the
former
senator's
position
harris
numbers
have
fallen
since
that
moment
and
big-money
donors
reportedly
said
this
week
they
would
abandon
her
candidacy
if
she
didn't
have
a
strong
performance
on
thursday
kamala
will
take
on
donald
trump
directly
harris
press
secretary
ian
sams
promised
in
her
opening
statement
harris
did
just
that
she
dubiously
claimed
that
the
only
reason
trump
has
not
been
indicted
is
that
justice
department
guidelines
prohibit
the
indictment
of
a
sitting
president
a
proposition
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
has
explicitly
denied
for
his
part
trump's
campaign
was
visible
during
the
debate
in
houston
overhead
his
campaign
was
using
a
plane
to
fly
a
banner
that
reads
socialism
will
kill
houston's
economy
o'rourke
meanwhile
continued
to
refocus
his
campaign
on
pushing
unprecedented
gun-control
measures
including
mandatory
buybacks
of
legal
firearms
o'rourke
when
he
was
running
for
the
senate
in
texas
just
last
year
explicitly
said
that
he
opposed
confiscating
legally
purchased
ar-
s
in
his
opening
statement
o'rourke
urged
americans
to
be
bigger
than
petty
politics
just
after
he
stated
that
the
recent
mass
shooting
in
el
paso
texas
was
inspired
by
the
president
in
his
manifesto
the
shooter
explicitly
said
trump
had
not
done
so
o'rourke
doubled
down
on
his
mandatory
gun-buyback
program
later
on
we
have
a
white
supremacist
in
the
white
house
and
he
poses
a
mortal
threat
to
people
of
color
all
across
this
country
he
said
hell
yes
when
asked
if
guns
needed
to
be
confiscated
o'rourke
added
when
we
see
that
being
used
against
children
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore

obviously
he

trigger
but
he's
certainly
been
tweeting

harris
then
took
aim
at

and
advanced
her
plan
to
unilaterally
take
executive
action
on
guns
if
necessary

hey

instead
of

harris

all
asserted
