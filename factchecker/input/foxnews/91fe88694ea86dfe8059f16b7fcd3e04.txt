joe
biden's
campaign
offered
a
warning
to
the
former
vice
president's
democratic
primary
rivals
after
thursday
night's
debate
attacking
joe
biden
is
not
the
way
to
advance
yourself
in
the
polls
from
the
spin
room
at
texas

university
in
houston
on
thursday
biden
campaign
officials
briefed
reporters
after
what
they
called
a
stellar
night
and
forceful
passionate
performance
from
the
party's
frontrunner
biden
mocks
sanders
for
a
socialist
you've
got
a
lot
more
confidence
in
corporate
america
than
i
do
i
think
candidates
have
seen
not
just
in
the
debates
but
over
the
course
of
this
campaign
that
attacking
joe
biden
is
not
the
way
to
advance
yourself
in
the
polls
biden
deputy
campaign
manager
kate
beddingfield
said
after
the
debate
i
do
think
candidates
are
seeing
that
and
learning
that
lesson
in
terms
of
where
we
are
in
the
race
prior
to
thursday's
debate
the
campaign
told
reporters
that
biden
had
a
target
on
his
back
as
the
frontrunner
after
grappling
with
sustained
critical
media
coverage
and
a
narrative
from
his
left
flank
that
he's
not
progressive
enough
but
during
thursday
night's
debate
it
was
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
julian
castro
who
attempted
to
bash
biden
this
time
seemingly
hitting
him
on
his
age
and
memory
castro
lands
low
blow
on
biden
castro
took
a
shot
at
biden's
memory
accusing
him
of
contradicting
himself
about
whether
americans
would
have
to
buy
into
a
public
health
care
option
under
his
plan
or
if
they
would
be
automatically
enrolled
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
castro
said
you're
forgetting
that
castro's
comment
wasn't
accurate
as
biden
just
minutes
before
stated
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
biden
campaign
rejects
moderate
label
swipes
at
plan-obsessed
rivals
biden
adviser
anita
dunn
checked
castro
saying
that
his
cheap
shot
was
based
on
a
lie
i
think
castro
who
likes
to
talk
about
learning
from
history
clearly
didn't
learn
from
the
first
two
debates
that
taking
personal
cheap
shots
at
vice
president
biden
actually
doesn't
work
out
that
well
for
the
candidate
who
throws
the
shot
dunn
told
reporters
it's
unfortunate
that
castro
decided
to
go
the
route
he
did
meanwhile
the
campaign
said
thursday's
debate
was
an
important
exchange
about
policy
and
that
voters
now
know
more
about
the
candidates
dunn
touted
biden's
performance
saying
that
biden's
persona
on
thursday
was
that
of
joe
biden
the
statesman
citing
his
empathy
toward
other
candidates
on
stage
over
a
series
of
issues
click
here
to
get
the
fox
news
app
his
final
answer
on
resilience
really
did
illustrate
why
people
really
have
a
real
connection
with
vice
president
biden
and
why
they
feel
he
gets
their
lives
and
why
they
could
trust
him
she
said
and
biden
senior
adviser
symone
sanders
added
that
voters
know
joe
biden
they
know
him
they
know
his
record
they
know
he's
been
there
for
them
she
said
so
the
asserting
anything
that
flies
in
the
face
of
what
the
voters
know
to
be
true
themselves
because
of
their
experience
with
vice
president
biden
just
won't
stick
