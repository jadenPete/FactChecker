u.s.
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
has
apparently
reached
a
boiling
point
over
moderate
house
democrats
caution
regarding
the
prospect
of
impeaching
president
trump
the
go-slow
approach
is
personified
by
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
with
whom
ocasio-cortez
has
had
an
often
contentious
relationship
since
the
freshman
lawmaker
arrived
in
washington
just
eight
months
ago
the
new
york
democrat
told
her
more
than
million
twitter
followers
late
saturday
that
the
democrats
refusal
to
seek
the
removal
of
the
president
was
a
bigger
national
scandal
than
what
she
alleged
was
the
president's
lawbreaking
behavior
justin
haskins
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
proves
again
she
has
no
idea
what
she
is
talking
about
calls
for
impeachment
have
grown
louder
from
some
democrats
in
the
wake
of
last
week's
news
that
a
purported
whistleblower
had
expressed
concern
about
a
phone
call
said
to
have
taken
place
between
president
trump
and
the
leader
of
ukraine
in
which
trump
allegedly
sought
information
about
democratic
frontrunner
joe
biden
whose
son
hunter
biden
had
business
dealings
in
ukraine
soon
after
ocasio-cortez
posted
her
saturday
comment
she
received
a
response
from
james
fallows
the
noted
author
journalist
and
former
speechwriter
for
president
jimmy
carter
who
asserted
that
ocasio-cortez
was
overstating
the
case
in
criticizing
members
of
her
own
party
for
exercising
restraint
regarding
impeachment
leading
house
dem
tells
party
not
to
be
hasty
in
pursuing
whistleblower
allegations
imo
this
is
false
equivalence
of
its
own
sort
fallows
wrote
what
trump
is
doing
remains
objectively
the
biggest
threat
scandal
and
problem
second-ranking
the
silent
acquiescence
of
the
gop
senate
then
it's
time
for
the
house
to
act
ocasio
cortez
doubled
down
in
her
response
to
fallows
it
is
one
thing
for
a
sitting
president
to
break
the
law
she
wrote
it's
another
to
let
him
the
integrity
of
our
democracy
isn't
threatened
when
a
president
breaks
the
law
it's
threatened
when
we
do
nothing
about
it
the
gop's
silence
refusal
to
act
shouldn't
be
a
surprise
ours
is
ocasio-cortez's
online
outburst
followed
remarks
earlier
in
the
day
by
fellow
progressive
and
presidential
candidate
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
who
took
a
veiled
shot
at
pelosi
the
standard-bearer
among
democrats
of
a
wait
and
see
approach
regarding
potential
action
against
the
president
donald
trump
did
everything
he
could
to
obstruct
justice
warren
said
at
an
event
in
iowa
i
read
all
pages
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
on
the
russia
investigation
and
when
i
got
to
the
end
i
called
for
the
impeachment
of
donald
trump
congress
failed
to
act
warren
added
and
now
donald
trump
has
shown
that
he
believes
he
is
above
the
law
he
has
solicited
another
foreign
government
to
attack
our
election
system
just
over
a
week
ago
pelosi
had
lashed
out
at
reporters
when
they
repeatedly
asked
her
about
impeachment
at
a
news
conference
impeachment
is
a
very
divisive
measure
a
clearly
frustrated
pelosi
said
but
if
we
have
to
go
there
we
have
to
go
there
and
we
can't
go
there
unless
we
have
the
facts
and
we'll
follow
the
facts
and
follow
the
obstruction
the
president
is
making
and
make
a
decision
when
we're
ready
that's
the
only
question
that's
all
i'm
going
to
say
about
this
subject
and
there's
nothing
different
from
one
day
to
the
next
she
added
the
struggles
experienced
by
the
year-old
pelosi
a
three-decade
member
of
congress
from
california
have
included
frequent
clashes
with
ocasio-cortez
and
other
progressive
and
aggressive
young
lawmakers
who
were
swept
into
office
during
last
year's
midterm
elections
the
progressives
push
for
far-left
policies
including
ocasio-cortez's
green
new
deal
as
well
as
their
vocal
opposition
to
president
trump
have
been
at
odds
with
the
moderates
typically
lower-key
approach
to
getting
things
done

pelosi
and
ocasio-cortez
appeared
to
reach
a
truce
of
sorts
after
a
closed-door
meeting
in
july
in
which
both
sought
to
ease
infighting
that
some
democrats
viewed
as
counterproductive
the
meeting
was
soon
followed
by
the
departure
of
ocasio-cortez's
chief
of
staff
saikat
chakrabarti
but
with
ocasio-cortez's
twitter
posts
that
began
late
saturday
it
appears
the
truce
with
pelosi
at
least
regarding
impeachment
may
be
over
