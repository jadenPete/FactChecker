wapo
sen
elizabeth
warren
hailed
the
political
power
of
female-led
organizing
in
a
speech
monday
night
that
invoked
the
deadly
triangle
shirtwaist
factory
fire
to
argue
that
outrage
can
spark
positive
change
and
to
make
the
case
for
her
own
presidential
ambitions
warren
has
long
faced
doubts
from
some
democratic
leaders
and
voters
who
wonder
if
she
would
be
able
to
defeat
president
trump
because
of
her
outspoken
liberal
message
and
voters
possible
reluctance
to
embrace
a
woman
as
president
monday's
speech
and
the
big
crowd
it
attracted
was
in
part
an
attempt
to
rebut
such
doubts
by
arguing
that
liberal
women
have
won
big
change
before
in
fact
we're
not
here
because
of
men
at
all
we're
here
because
of
some
hard-working
women
the
comments
were
a
more
direct
nod
to
gender
than
most
of
her
public
remarks
to
date
which
typically
focus
on
the
ways
in
which
powerful

the

still-important

decidedly

eight

according
to

the
