survivors
united
for
justice

terrorism
said
in
a
statement
the
families
are
dedicated
to
getting
to
the
truth
and
we
shouldn't
have
to
beg
for
this
sort
of
basic
information
or
be
kept
in
the
dark
about
the
saudi
role
in
the
attacks

two
of

the
saudi
government
has
repeatedly
denied
any
involvement
in
the
attacks
of
the
al
qaeda
attackers
who
hijacked
the
four
planes
were
saudi
nationals
the
commission
report
found
no
evidence
that
the
saudi
government
as
an
institution
or
senior
saudi
officials
individually
funded
the
attacks
that
al
qaeda
masterminded
but
the
commission
also
noted
the
likelihood
that
saudi
government-sponsored
charities
did
images
of
the
attack
that
changed
the
world
the
plaintiffs
note
that
much
more
information
has
come
to
light
since
that
report
and
the
existence
of
the
fbi
report
in
shows
that
authorities
were
continuing
to
investigate
years
after
the
attack
the
individual's
name
was
the
families
top
priority
in
the
subpoena
still
the
fbi
did
not
disclose
other
information
requested
in
the
suit
barr
did
invoke
state
secrets
to
block
the
release
of
other
information
in
that
report
that
he
says
could
harm
national
security
if
released

the
lawsuit
against
the
saudis
was
first
brought
in
new
york
federal
court
in
but
it
has
gained
traction
in
recent
years
a
law
permits
foreign
governments
to
be
held
liable
in
american
courts
for
acts
of
terrorism
and
a
judge
last
year
rejected
a
saudi
request
to
dismiss
the
case
and
instead
ordered
discovery
into
whether
the
government
had
a
role
in
the
attacks
the
release
of
the
information
publicly
could
be
received
coldly
by
president
trump
who
attempts
to
maintain
close
ties
to
the
saudi
government
which
he
has
said
is
an
important
ally
in
the
region
and
supports
the
u.s.
defense
industry
with
billions
in
arms
purchases
