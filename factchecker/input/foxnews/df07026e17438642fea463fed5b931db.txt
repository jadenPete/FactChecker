long
a
liberal
bastion
that
has
been
aggressively
reshaped
into
a
more

court
by

handed
the

a
major
win
late
monday
lifting
a
nationwide
injunction
on
his
asylum
policy
earlier
in
the
day
obama-appointed
u.s.
district
judge
jon
tigar
in
california
had
reinstated
a
nationwide
halt
on
the
trump
administration's
plan
to
prevent
most
migrants
from
seeking
asylum
at
the
u.s.
mexico
border
if
they
first
crossed
through
another
country
on
the
way
but
in
an
administrative
order
first
obtained
by
politico
the
th
circuit
rolled
tigar's
ruling
right
back
saying
that
for
now
it
should
only
apply
to
the
confines
of
the
th
circuit
which
encompasses
california
arizona
alaska
hawaii
montana

and
washington
the

now
has
seven
trump-appointed
federal
judges
more
than
any
other

bench
the
radical
transformation
of
the
court
which
has
seats
is
largely
the
result
of
trump's
push
to
nominate
conservative

said
the

have
halted
some
of
trump's
key
policy
shifts
on

including
an
earlier
version
of
an

the

amid

the
rules
issued
by
the
trump
administration
in
july
apply
to
most
migrants
who
pass
through
another
country
before
reaching
the
united
states
they
target
tens
of
thousands
of
central
americans
fleeing
violence
and
poverty
who
cross
mexico
each
month
to
seek
asylum
and
would
affect
asylum
seekers
from
africa
asia
and
south
america
who
arrive
regularly
at
the
southern
border
the
shift
reversed
decades
of
u.s.
policy
in
what
trump
administration
officials
said
was
an
attempt
to
close
the
gap
between
an
initial
asylum
screening
that
most
people
pass
and
a
final
decision
on
asylum
that
most
people
do
not
win
mexico
deserves
credit

needs
to
sustain
efforts

u.s.

to

how
they

the
crucial
exception
is
for
those
who

the

is
vague
on
how
a

it
says
pursuant

a
bilateral

multilateral
agreement
people
are
generally
eligible
for
asylum
in
the
u.s.
if
they
credibly
fear

the
vast
majority
of
asylum
claims
are
denied
however
and
the

has
said
the
system
is
being
abused

relief

it
