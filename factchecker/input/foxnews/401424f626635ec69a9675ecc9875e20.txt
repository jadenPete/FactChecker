he
accused

story
correction
after

it's
just
as
transparent
and
self-serving
today
mcconnell
said
in
his
blistering
floor
speech
he
went
on
to
rebuke
several
senate
democrats
for
a
recent
brief
that
urged
the
supreme
court
to
heal
itself
or
face
restructuring
which
was
widely
seen
as
a
threat
of
court-packing
this
is
not
normal
political
behavior

south

republican
sen
lindsey

the

committee
chairman
who
mounted
one
of
the
most
passionate
defenses
of
kavanaugh
during
his
confirmation
hearing
called
the
attacks
beyond
the
pale
my
heart
goes
out
to
justice
kavanaugh's
family
for
being
forced
to
endure
this
ridiculous
treatment
once
again
he
tweeted
many
of
the
democrats
seeking
to
unseat
president
trump
in
over
the
weekend
released
statements
calling
for
congress
to
impeach
kavanaugh
citing
the
new
york
times
reporting
of
a
disputed
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
but
graham
insisted
that
wouldn't
happen
as
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
i
promise
you
justice
kavanaugh
will
not
be
impeached
over
these
scurrilous
accusations

tweeted
iowa
gop
sen
chuck
grassley
who
led
the
judiciary
committee
during
the
kavanaugh
hearings
said
his
office
never
received
an
allegation
against
kavanaugh
like
the
one
referenced
in
the
report
over
the
weekend
we
now
have
an
uncorroborated
accusation
rooted
only
in
unnamed
sources
with
no
direct
knowledge
of
the
event
and
that
the
alleged
victim
doesn't
even
remember
grassley
said
since
when
did
that
become
something
fit
to
print
by
the
supposed
american
paper
of
record
by
late
sunday
the
paper
had
revised
its
portrayed
blockbuster
story
to
include
the
fact
that
several
friends
of
the
alleged
victim
said
she
told
them
she
did
not
recall
the
reported
sexual
assault

president
trump
repeatedly
ripped
the

the

writing
the
reality
of

that

it's
more
clear
than
ever
that

last

the
kavanaugh
nomination
was
rammed
through

not
exoneration

these
