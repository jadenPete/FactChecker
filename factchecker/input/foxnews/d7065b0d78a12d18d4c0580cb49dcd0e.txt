joe

still
leads
in

elizabeth

from
houston
houston
the
biden
campaign
previewed
its
debate
strategy
for
thursday
night
by
making
at
least
two
things
clear
the
former
vice
president
will
reject
efforts
to
cast
him
as
an
incremental
moderate
and
he'll
call
on
his
rivals
to
do
more
than
just
wave
around
an
arsenal
of
policy
proposals
the
vice
president
will
argue
we
need
more
than
just
plans
we
need
action
we
need
progress
a
senior
biden
campaign
official
said
thursday
this
race
is
not
just
about
plans
it's
about
getting
things
done
for
people
trump

banner
over

site
the
comments
came
during
a
briefing
with
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
debate
in
houston
and
they
amounted
to
an
implicit
swipe
at
surging
sen
elizabeth
warren
who
is
best
known
for
her
reams
of
plans
the
massachusetts
senator
published
yet
another
of
those
plans
on
thursday
morning
focused
on
social
security
the
dynamic
between
the
two
rivals
could
be
the
main
attraction
as
this
is
the
first
time
warren
has
been
on
the
same
stage
with
biden
in
this
democratic
primary
cycle
with
the
criteria
tightened
for
this
the
third
debate
matchup
among
the
dem
candidates
only
the
top-polling
contenders
will
appear
as
opposed
to
the
field
being
split
in
half
for
two
consecutive
nights
of
debates
the
debate
is
a
clear
opportunity
for
warren
to
build
on
the
momentum
her
campaign
has
experienced
in
recent
weeks
but
biden
grappling
with
sustained
critical
media
coverage
over
a
string
of
verbal
flubs
and
a
narrative
from
his
left
flank
that
he's
not
progressive
enough
is
determined
to
convince
voters
there's
more
to
his
candidacy
than
just
the
electability
factor
according
to
the
campaign
he'll
talk
about
the
meaningful
change
he
helped
pursue
while
vice
president
under
barack
obama
and
his
plans
to
build
on
that
success
he'll
talk
about
his
substantive
record
the
official
said
touting
his
victories
against
the
national
rifle
association
nra
and
support
for
the
violence
against
women
act
joe
biden
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
progressive
change
the
official
said
warren
unveils
social
security
plan
the
campaign
also
said
biden
will
reject
the
premise
that
the
ideas
he
is
putting
forward
are
incremental
we
believe
there
is
a
false
dichotomy
in
this
race
between
candidates
who
are
supposedly
the
liberal
revolutionaries
and
those
who
are
for
incremental
change
another
official
said
as
for
his
strategy
for
the
debate
stage
the
campaign
made
clear
that
biden
is
not
in
this
race
to
attack
other
democrats
he's
been
very
clear
about
that
one
official
said
our
hope
and
aim
is
that
this
will
be
a
substantive
policy
discussion
the
official
added
though
that
biden
has
not
shied
away
from
drawing
a
contrast
between
his
health
care
plan
and
medicare-for-all
specifically
the
cost
in
another
apparent
swipe
at
warren
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
he's
not
in
the
race
to
attack
other
democrats
but
he
is
not
going
to
shy
away
from
having
a
meaningful
conversation
the
official
said
despite
being
the
consistent
frontrunner
in
the
crowded
democratic
primary
field
biden
has
grappled
with
critical
media
coverage
and
general
frustration
with
his
candidacy
from
the
left
his
campaign
appearances
have
also
been
marred
by
some
verbal
slips
in
recent
weeks
while
some
top
democrats
have
questioned
his
handling
of
his
own
record
former
obama
adviser
david
axelrod
recently
accused
him
of
distorting
his
record
on
the
iraq
war
biden
famously
weathered
a
rhetorical
broadside
from
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
during
the
first
primary
debate
in
connection
with
his
past
stance
on
desegregation
busing
republicans
meanwhile
sought
to
capitalize
on
the
debate
by
hammering
their
message
that
the
party
is
drifting
into
socialism
the
socialists
are
in
town
today
they
want
the
government
to
tell
you
what
job
you
can
have
what
health
care
you
can
have
and
what
school
you
can
go
to
they
want
to
control
every
aspect
of
your
life
and
they
want
taxpayers
to
pay
for
it

on

that's
not
what

is
about
