the
squad
is
planning
tuesday
to
introduce
a
resolution
seeking
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
supreme
court
associate
justice
brett
kavanaugh
despite
reluctance
from
top
democrats
to
pursue
one
and
concerns
about
the
basis
for
the
latest
accusations
the
resolution
follows
a
new
york
times
report
that
included
a
new
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
from
when
kavanaugh
was
in
college
although
an
editors
note
later
revealed
that
the
alleged
victim
did
not
recall
it
taking
place
in
a
statement
pressley
only
focused
on
the
women
who
came
forward
during

process

to
retweet
a
post
that
included
images
of
what
appears
to
be
text
from
the
resolution
it
calls
for
inquiring
whether
the
house

should
impeach
brett
michael
kavanaugh
associate
justice
for
the
supreme

of
the

who
heads
the

committee
has
not
necessarily
come
out
against
impeaching

but
he
made
clear
it
was
not
a
top
priority
for
his
committee
we
have
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
right
now

we've

is
the
answer
to
every
problem
durbin
said
according
to
politico
it's
not
realistic
if
that's
how
we
are
identified
in

as
the

congress
we
run
the
risk
that
people
will
feel
we're
ignoring

that
mean
a
lot
to
them
as
