andrew
yang's
campaign
cash
giveaway
raising
legal
concerns
despite
dem's
claims
andrew
yang
our
campaign
has
been
growing
steadily
over
timedemocratic
presidential
hopeful
andrew
yang
on
how
he
plans
to
pay
for
his
universal
basic
income
plan
andrew
yang
insisted
to
fox
news
this
week
that
his
small
army
of
very
very
smart
lawyers
assures
him
his
pitch
to
give
random
families
per
month
to
spotlight
his
plan
for
a
universal
basic
income
for
all
adult
americans
is
perfectly
legal
but
some
leading
campaign
finance
experts
are
taking
issue
with
the
democratic
presidential
candidate's
provocative
promotion
and
say
it's
likely
yang's
breaking
campaign
finance
laws
trump
weighs
in
after
writer's
andrew
yang
tweet
the
problem
for
the
tech
entrepreneur
who's
seen
his
once
long-shot
bid
for
the
white
house
gain
traction
this
summer
thanks
to
the
buzz
generated
by
his
so-called
freedom
dividend
is
that
federal
law
prohibits
campaign
contributions
from
being
used
for
personal
purposes
those
uses
include
such
things
as
paying
the
mortgage
or
rent
buying
groceries
purchasing
clothes
or
filling
up
the
car
with
gas
basically
any
expense
that
could
be
made
without
a
campaign
purpose
larry
noble
a
former
federal
election
commission
general
counsel
tweeted
that
a
lottery
to
give
money
to
potential
supporters
may
violate
law
and
is
a
slippery
slope
the
nonpartisan
campaign
legal
center
which
works
to
minimize
the
influence
of
big
money
in
politics
tweeted
before
andrewyang
starts
handing
out
campaign
money
he
might
want
to
ask
an
election
law
expert
to
explain
usc
b
the
section
of
the
federal
code
that
bans
the
conversion
of
campaign
funds
to
personal
use
and
former
u.s.
attorney
preet
bharara
an
anti-corruption
crusader
questioned
whether
yang
vetted
his
month
to
voters
from
campaign
funds
with
an
actual
lawyer
campaign
finance
expert
craig
holman
who
serves
as
public
citizen's
capitol
hill
lobbyist
on
ethics
lobbying
and
campaign
finance
rules
told
fox
news
that
federal
law
defines
personal
purposes
as
any
expense
that
is
irrespective
of
the
campaign
in
other
words
if
it's
an
expense
that
could
be
made
without
any
campaign
purpose
that's
a
personal
purpose
holman
said
it
would
likely
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
campaign
finance
law
if
yang
uses
campaign
funds
to
pay
the
families
per
month
yang
predicts
he'll
double
campaign
cash
haul
in
third
quarter
but
yang's
campaign
says
the
payments
are
considered
a
campaign
expense
because
they're
being
made
to
further
the
goals
of
the
campaign
in
a
bout
of
showmanship
yang
announced
in
his
opening
statement
at
last
week's
third
round
democratic
presidential
debate
that
i'm
going
to
do
something
unprecedented
tonight
the
candidate
then
highlighted
that
his
campaign
will
now
give
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
for
an
entire
year
to
american
families
someone
watching
this
at
home
right
now
if
you
believe
that
you
can
solve
your
own
problems
better
than
any
politician
go
to
yang
com
and
tell
us
how
a
month
will
help
you
do
just
that
yang
in
front
of
millions
of
people
watching
the
debate
emphasized
that
when
you
donate
money
to
a
presidential
campaign
what
happens
the
politician
spends
the
money
on
tv
ads
and
consultants
and
you
hope
it
works
out
it's
time
to
trust
ourselves
more
than
our
politicians
the
latest
from
fox
news
on
the
presidential
campaign
yang
was
the
ceo
of
the
test-prep
education
company
manhattan
gmat
in
he
launched
venture
for
america
a
new
york
city-headquartered
organization
that
trains
entrepreneurs
since
declaring
his
candidacy
for
president
a
year
and
a
half
ago
the
central
theme
of
his
campaign
is
that
automation
is
increasingly
displacing
the
country's
workforce
and
that
a
cash
payment
will
be
needed
for
people
to
afford
to
live
through
the
automation
evolution
the
candidate
argues
that
his
freedom
dividend
of
per
year
to
each
adult
american
would
help
people
improve
their
health
nutrition
pay
off
some
debts
and
bills
that
have
been
hanging
over
them
reduce
their
stress
levels
yang
explains
that
his
plan
would
be
paid
for
by
a
value-added
tax
known
as
a
vat
he's
estimated
a
percent
vat
would
raise
some
billion
to
publicize
his
universal
basic
income
proposal
yang's
already
paying
a
month
to
three
families
in
the
early
voting
caucus
and
primary
states
of
iowa
and
new
hampshire
as
well
as
another
in
the
key
battleground
state
of
florida
but
yang's
been
bankrolling
those
contributions
from
his
own
personal
funds
i
talked
to
the
fec
and
they
said
as
long
as
it's
my
personal
funds
and
it's
a
personal
gift
with
no
strings
attached
they
have
no
issues
yang
told
fox
news
in
february
when
the
first
family
began
receiving
their
monthly
payments
he
added
that
he
was
optimistic
the
families
receiving
his
personal
cash
payments
this
year
will
come
out
for
me
but
i
have
no
expectations
and
certainly
no
obligations
he
described
the
payments
as
gifts
on
his
campaign
finance
reports
to
the
fec
but
using
campaign
funds
to
bankroll
more
families
is
a
whole
new
ballgame
however
there's
a
twist
the
fec
basically
has
been
paralyzed
by
partisan
gridlock
and
dysfunction
in
the
nation's
capital
it
doesn't
have
enough
commissioners
to
make
rulings
or
punish
violators
of
election
law
anyway
the
fec
has
closed
its
doors
it's
gone
defunct
holman
emphasized
he
questioned
whether
yang
could
be
banking
on
the
fact
that
there
is
no
campaign
finance
cop
on
the
beat
there
is
no
enforcement
agency
to
enforce
the
law
the
department
of
justice
could
step
in
if
it
wanted
to
but
they
usually
only
step
in
if
it's
an
egregious
criminal
violation
of
the
law
this
would
be
a
civil
violation
yang's
campaign
announced
on
monday
they
received
million
in
donations
and
email
entries
from
his
announcement
on
thursday
through
the
weekend
of
what
they
call
the
freedom
dividend
pilot
program
democratic
presidential
candidate
andrew
yang
speaks
with
reporters
following
a
campaign
rally
in
boston
on
sept
the
candidate
speaking
with
fox
news
and
other
news
organizations
after
a
campaign
rally
monday
evening
in
boston-
pushed
back
against
the
criticism
of
the
legality
of
his
pilot
program
i
want
people
to
reflect
for
a
moment
on
the
system
we're
in
the
midst
of
yang
said
if
i
had
million
in
campaign
funds
and
i
gave
them
to
a
media
company
like
your
employers
no
offense
or
consultants
or
an
army
of
canvassers
then
everyone
would
be
like
that's
a-ok
but
if
i
give
them
to
americans
to
do
whatever
they
like
in
positive
ways
that
something
problematic
i
want
everyone
to
reflect
on
that
and
how
bizarre
that
is
