committee
the
house
judiciary
committee's
first
hearing
as
part
of
its
trump
impeachment
investigation
descended
into
chaos
tuesday
as
democrats
clashed
with
a
combative
corey
lewandowski
trading
insults
and
accusations
with
the
former
trump
campaign
manager
who
refused
to
answer
many
of
their
questions
after
five
hours
of
testimony
before
lawmakers
the
top
democrat
on
the
committee
rep
jerry
nadler
told
lewandowski
his
behavior
in
this
hearing
room
has
been
completely
unacceptable
and
said
holding
him
in
contempt
is
certainly
under
consideration
lewandowski
immediately
frustrated
nadler
the
committee's
chairman
during
the
democrat's
first
question
earlier
in
the
day
when
the
witness
in
an
apparent
effort
to
stall
for
time
repeatedly
asked
nadler
to
point
to
the
specific
section
in
the
robert
mueller
report
related
to
his
question
lewandowski
was
following
white
house
orders
not
to
discuss
confidential
conversations
with
the
president
beyond
what
was
already
public
in
the
former
special
counsel's
report
doj
uses
democrats
impeachment
confusion
against
them
in
court
asked
by
nadler
if
he
met
alone
with
president
donald
trump
in
june
lewandowski
said
could
you
read
the
exact
language
of
the
report
i
don't
have
it
available
to
me
i
don't
think
i
need
to
do
that
nadler
shot
back
i
have
limited
time
asked
the
question
again
lewandowski
told
nadler
he
needed
him
to
refresh
his
memory
of
what
was
in
the
report
he
demanded
that
democrats
provide
him
a
copy
of
the
report
sending
democratic
staff
scrambling
to
find
one
he's
filibustering
a
frustrated
nadler
said
amid
the
back-and-forth
the
top
republican
on
the
committee
georgia
rep
doug
collins
moved
to
adjourn
the
hearing
forcing
a
failed
voice
vote
that
caused
further
delay
before
questioning
resumed
from
other
lawmakers
lewandowski
later
declined
to
play
along
with
certain
questions
new
york
democratic
rep
hakeem
jeffries
asked
lewandowski
if
he
was
trump's
hitman
the
bag
man
the
lookout
or
all
of
the
above
i
think
i'm
the
good
looking
man
actually
lewandowski
replied
lewandowski
is
considering
a
run
for
the
senate
in
new
hampshire
in
in
a
reminder
of
the
political
backdrop
during
a
recess
the
witness
tweeted
out
a
link
to
a
website
promoting
his
possible
candidacy
and
democrats
referenced
his
ambitions
you
are
not
on
the
campaign
trail
yet
jeffries
said
this
is
the
house
judiciary
committee
act
like
you
know
the
difference
there
were
fireworks
from
the
beginning
nadler
opened
by
saying
the
hearing
is
part
of
efforts
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
with
respect
to
president
trump
he
railed
against
the
white
house's
efforts
to
block
the
testimony
of
two
other
former
trump
aides
rick
dearborn
and
rob
porter
who
did
not
show
up
on
orders
from
the
administration
this
is
a
cover-up
plain
and
simple
nadler
said
of
the
white
house's
efforts
to
block
testimony
from
dearborn
and
porter
at
another
point
texas
rep
sheila
jackson
lee
told
lewandowski
you
are
obviously
here
to
block
any
reasonable
inquiry
into
the
truth
or
not
of
this
administration
lewandowski
fired
back
that
he
was
unable
to
give
her
a
response
because
it
wasn't
a
question
but
a
rant
during
his
questioning
georgia
rep
hank
johnson
said
mr
lewandowski
you
are
like
a
fish
being
cleaned
with
a
spoon
it's
very
hard
to
get
an
answer
out
of
you
lewandowski
appeared
to
mock
california
democratic
rep
eric
swalwell's
unsuccessful
bid
for
the
white
house
earlier
this
year
calling
him
president
swalwell
at
one
point
during
questioning
rhode
island
democratic
rep
david
cicilline
suggested
that
the
committee
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
over
his
refusal
to
cooperate
with
democratic
questions
democrats
repeatedly
asked
questions
about
mueller's
report
which
said
trump
asked
lewandowski
to
direct
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
limit
mueller's
investigation
the
report
said
trump
said
that
if
sessions
would
not
meet
with
lewandowski
then
lewandowski
should
tell
sessions
he
was
fired
lewandowski
never
delivered
the
message
but
asked
dearborn
a
former
sessions
aide
to
do
it
dearborn
said
he
was
uncomfortable
with
the
request
and
declined
to
deliver
it
according
to
the
report
tennessee
democratic
rep
steve
cohen
who
once
brought
a
bucket
of
fried
chicken
to
a
hearing
after
attorney
general
bill
barr
did
not
show
up
for
it
suggested
to
lewandowski
that
he
chickened
out
during
another
exchange
lewandowski
replied
that
he
did
not
and
claimed
he
went
on
a
family
vacation
in
his
opening
statement
lewandowski
railed
against
the
trump
investigations
it
is
now
clear
the
investigation
was
populated
by
many
trump
haters
who
had
their
own
agenda
to
try
and
take
down
a
duly
elected
president
of
the
united
states
he
said
as
for
actual
collusion
or
conspiracy
there
was
none
what
there
has
been
however
is
harassment
of
this
president
from
the
day
he
won
the
election
the
president
was
apparently
watching
and
tweeted
such
a
beautiful
opening
statement
by
corey
lewandowski
thank
you
corey
meanwhile
republicans
mocked
the
hearing
with
a
fired-up
ranking
member
collins
dismissing
it
as
re-run
season
saying
the
committee's
previous
hearing
with
mueller
didn't
go
well
collins
dismissed
the
democrats
effort
to
seek
impeachment
saying
you
don't
have
the
votes
mueller
found
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
establish
a
conspiracy
between
trump's
campaign
and
russia
but
reached
no
conclusion
on
obstruction
of
justice
barr
later
made
his
own
decision
on
obstruction
saying
there
was
insufficient
evidence
after
lawmakers
finished
their
inquiries
tuesday
lewandowski
was
questioned
into
the
early
evening
by
democratic
counsel
barry
berke
republicans
on
the
committee
decried
the
move
of
bringing
in
berke
who
was
hired
as
a
consultant
and
is
not
on
the
committee
staff
this
move
to
have
private
consultants
question
a
witness
during
an
oversight
hearing
is
an
egregious
violation
of
the
rules
of
the
house
and
pretends
that
the
judiciary
committee's
article
i
oversight
authority
extends
to
private
attorneys
when
it
doesn't
collins
said
in
a
statement
i
cannot
believe
that
judiciary
democrats
are
outsourcing
their
pseudo-impeachment
inquiry
to
paid
consultants

the
hearing
underscores
what
has
been
a
central
dilemma
for
house
democrats
all
year
they
have
promised
to
investigate
trump
aggressively
and
many
of
their
base
supporters
want
them
to
move
quickly
to
try
to
remove
him
from
office
but
the
white
house
has
blocked
their
oversight
requests
at
most
every
turn
declining
to
provide
new
documents
or
allow
former
aides
to
testify
the
republican
senate
is
certain
to
rebuff
any
house
efforts
to
bring
charges
against
the
president
and
moderate
democrats
in
their
own
caucus
have
expressed
nervousness
that
the
impeachment
push
could
crowd
out
their
other
accomplishments
still
the
judiciary
panel
is
moving
ahead
approving
rules
for
impeachment
hearings

week
