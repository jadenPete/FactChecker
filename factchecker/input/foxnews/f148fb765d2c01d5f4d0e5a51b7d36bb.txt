changes
in
management
at
the
new
york
times
during
a
fiery
rally
in
democratic-leaning
new

on
monday
night
after
the

published
a
bombshell
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
against
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
before
later
acknowledging
under
pressure
that
the
alleged
victim
said
she
had
no
recollection
of
the
event
the
slew
of
democrats
running
for
president
who
quickly
called
for

impeachment
over
the
weekend
based
on
the
times
reporting
indicated
later
on

they
weren't
backing

they're
calling
for
his
impeachment
and
the
woman
involved
said
she
doesn't
know
anything
so
the
new
york
times
had
to
put
out
a
major
apology
and
they

change
their
story
and
they
still
want
him
to
be
impeached

for
the
resignation
of
everybody
at
the
new

which
is
just
as
phony
a
story
they've
taken
the
old
grey
lady
so
prestigious
and
broken
her

destroyed
her

and
ruined
her
reputation
she
can
never

remarks

statements
earlier

rep
jerry

the
head
of

appeared
to
throw
cold
water
on
the
idea
of
impeaching
kavanaugh
nadler
remarked
on
a
radio
show
monday
we
have
our
hands
full
with
impeaching
the
president
right
now
that
effort
also
appeared
to
be
stalled
with
top
democrats
unable
to
agree
on
whether
impeachment
proceedings
are
currently
occurring
the
explosive
rally
in
suburban
albuquerque
came
hours
after
new
york
city
prosecutors
went
on
the
offensive
by
subpoenaing
trump's
tax
returns
but
trump's
presence
in
the
democratic-leaning
state
was
itself
an
aggressive
maneuver
that
signaled
a
new
campaign
strategy
the
event
is
the
first
stop
on
a
three-day
swing
that

trump
said
at
the
outset
of
the
rally
before
touting
the
state's
economic
progress
under
his
administration
new
mexico
is
in
the
midst
of
an
oil-production
boom
that
has
boosted
employment
and
spurred
a
state

spending
spree
from

democratic
gov
michelle
lujan
grisham
on
public
education
roadway
projects
and
tax
rebates
for

productions
crude
oil
production
has
more
than
doubled
and
it's
going
up
higher
quickly
trump
said
and
your
state's
energy
revenues
are
up
by
nearly
two-thirds
think
of
that
chants
of
four
more
years
broke
out
trump
said
the
current
spat
with
iran
in
the
middle
east
would
have
caused
a
panic
under
previous
administrations
when
the
u.s.
was
not
a
net
exporter
of
energy
and
had
not
attained
energy
independence
it's
looking
like
iran
behind
saudi
drone
attack
trump
says
as
he
warns

you

trump's
efforts
in
new
mexico
will
provide
a
test
of
how
well
his
often-harsh
rhetoric
about
immigrants
will
play
with
hispanic
voters
who
comprise
nearly
percent
of
new
mexico's
electorate
yesterday
marked
the
beginning
of

the

for

is
right
now
at
the
lowest
level
in
the
history
of
our
country
hispanic
american
poverty
reached
a
brand-new
all-time
low
in
history
and
after
years
of
stagnation
that
you
know
very
well
wages
for
hispanic
americans
are
rising
really
fast
up
nearly
percent
since
my
election
those
are
unheard-of
numbers
and
median
income
for
hispanic
americans
surpassed
for
the
first
time
ever
that's
not
bad
the
president
went
on
to
praise
mexico's
efforts
to
assist
in
border
enforcement
which
commenced
after
trump
threatened
the
country
with
punishing
tariffs
border
apprehensions
have
plunged
as
a
result
of
that
assistance
administration
officials
said
citing
the
latest
data
from
the
department
of
homeland
security
trump
is
looking
to
find
the
next
wisconsin
or
michigan
states
that
democrats
generally
win
in
presidential
elections
but
that
can
surprise
under
certain
conditions
as
they
did

christine

says

accusations

add
up
new
mexico
has
not
tilted
toward
a
republican
in
the
presidential
election
since
trump
captured
just

vowed
to
step
up

trump's
first
visit

drew
visitors
from
colorado

all
parts

according
to
local
media
reports
this
is
new

a
lot
of
people
in

really
like
trump
because
he's
fighting
for
them
an
attendee
told
local
station
krqe-
some
observers
however
have
their
doubts
bush
had
much
higher
favorable
opinions
by
hispanics
said
lonna
atkeson
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
new
mexico
who
noted
bush
defeated
sen
john
kerry
years
ago
by
winning
over
large
rural
swaths
of
the
state
he
was
from
texas
not
new
york
and
so
he
had
more
regional
ties
trump

a
very
different
portrait
among
those
waiting

was

valerie

the
top

in
a

primary
race
for

northern

district

currently
represents
plame
noted
she
has
a
few
scores
to
settle
with

in

before
spinning

in
a
swirl
of

the
campaign
advertisement's
accuracy
was
questioned
the
trump
campaign
said
that
the
situation
on
the
ground
in
the
state
has
changed
significantly
since
in
august
vice
president
pence
declared
new
mexico
was
back
in

politically
in
a
visit
to
the
permian
basin
a
booming
petroleum
production
zone
overlapping
portions
of
southern
new
mexico
and
western
texas
we
have
the
opportunity
because
of
our
fundraising
and
infrastructure
to
not
only
defend
the
states
we
carried
in
but
to
extend
the
map
in

committee

campaign
and
the
republican
national
committee
trump
campaign
spokesman
tim
murtaugh
said
he
believes
the
president's
standing
has
improved
since
he
credited
the
economy
including
the
fact
that
latino
unemployment
is
at
an
all-time
low
as
well
as
the
president's
stance
on
immigration
enforcement
the
most
valuable
commodity
that
we
have
as
a
campaign
is
the
president's
time
and
he
will
not
travel
all
the
way
to
new

a
