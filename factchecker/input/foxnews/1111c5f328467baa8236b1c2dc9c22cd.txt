by
all
members
of
the
council
u.k.
ambassador

pierce
told

hello
and
how
nice
it

her
with

which
is
fantastic

is
likely
to
clash
on
numerous
issues
started
their
relationship
by
saying
her
appointment
was
long-awaited
and
he
looks
forward
to
a
fruitful
and
constructive
and
lengthy
cooperation
craft
who
is
not
as
immediately
well-known
as
haley
will
be
closely
watched
for
the
extent
to
which
she
continues
the
combative
approach
of
her
predecessor
the
trump
administration
has
taken
a
skeptical
stance
toward
u.n.
operations
while
the
u.s.
succeeded
in
getting
a
series
of
sanctions
imposed
on
north
korea
and
south
sudan
it
has
pulled
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
the
paris
climate
deal
in
which
the
u.n.
played
key
roles
it
has
also
cut
funding
for
the
u.n.
palestinian
agency
pulled
out
of
the
scandal-ridden
u.n.
human
rights
council
and
the
u.n.
educational
scientific
and
cultural
organization
unesco
as
well
as
a
u.n.
arms
trade
treaty
and
challenged
what
it
asserts
is
the
anti-american
and
anti-israel
bias
at
the
body
craft
is
expected
to
continue
that
stance
craft
will
be
watched
closely
too
for
her
positions
on
energy
and
climate
change
the
u.n.
has
become
increasingly
focused
on
climate
change
in
recent
years
and
guterres
has
made
the
sustainable
development
goals
a
cornerstone
of
his
time
as
head
of
the
u.n.
during
the
confirmation
process
democrats
raised
concerns
about
her
past
remarks
about
climate
change
her
husband
joe
craft
is
a
coal
executive
and
the
couple
has
investments
in
the
energy
industry
she
has
said
she
would
recuse
herself
if
ever
a
matter
came
up
where
she
had
a
direct
financial
interest
it
will
also
remain
to
be
seen
to
what
extent
craft
has
the
same
level
of
independence
as
haley
who
stepped
down
in
december
unlike
haley's
craft's
position
is
not
at
cabinet
level
while
it
was
a
cabinet-level
position
under
former
president
barack
obama
and
the
first
few
years
of
trump's
administration
some
experts
say
the
position
should
not
come
with
a
seat
at
cabinet
by
making
the
united
nations
ambassador
a
cabinet
member
a
president
signals
the
u.n.
is
an
important
component
of
america's
foreign
policy
u.n.

columnist
benny
avni
told
fox
news
it
shouldn't
be
u.n.
ambassadors
should
have
the
same
rank
as
other
u.s.
envoys
around
the
world
former
u.n.
ambassador
john
bolton
used
to
say
his
job
was
to
promote
america's
interests
at
the
u.n.
not
promote
the
u.n.
in
america
he
said
too
often

do
the
latter
chinese
influence
surges
at

warns
of
concerted
push
to
advance

however
amid
a
rising
chinese
influence
at
the
u.n.
craft's
installation
is
likely
to
help
the
u.s.
better
discover
its
voice
at
the
u.n.
jonathan
wachtel
a
former
u.s.
mission
spokesman
under
haley
told
fox
news
that
getting
craft
into
the
position
formally
is
essential
for
u.s.
goals
at
the
u.n.
it
is
critical
to
have
full
representation
in
the
security
council
and
general
assembly
to
maximize
our
impact
on
how
best
to
resolve
crises
and
other
major

he
said
he
said
that
while
deputy
representative
jonathan
cohen
stepped
up
and
worked
long
hours
during
the
interim
period
craft's
participation
is
not
just
welcome
but
essential
she
like
her
predecessors
faces
many
complicated
and
intense
days
ahead
as
she
navigates
through
the
complexity
of
un
affairs
and
tries
to
apply
common
sense
to
as
many
of
the
world's
problems
as
she
can

craft's
entrance
to
the
u.n.
comes
after
the
departure
from
the
white
house
of
bolton
as
national
security
adviser
but
even
with
bolton's
departure
there
are
plenty
of
u.n.
skeptics
left
in
the
administration
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
has
expressed
his
concerns
about
the
u.n.
while
trump
once
dismissed
the
u.n.
as
a
club
for
people
to
get
together
talk
and
have
a
good
time
