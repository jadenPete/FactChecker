can
trump
flip
new
mexico
from
blue
to
red
in
the
trump
campaign
says
the
key
is
winning
over
hispanic
voters
in
a
state
that
hasn't
been
red
since
exclusive
the
republican
national
committee
rnc
is
expected
to
announce
this
week
that
it
raised
a
record-setting
million
in
august
and
had
million
cash
on
hand
as
of
the
end
of
that
month
signaling
growing
gop
momentum
heading
into
the
elections
it
isn't
unusual
for
a
committee
to
perform
well
when
its
party
controls
the
white
house
but
even
accounting
for
that
advantage
the
rnc's
numbers
were
significant
the
august
fundraising
total
was
the
highest
recorded
in
august
during
an
off-cycle
year
by
either
the
rnc
or
dnc
and
the
rnc
has
not
had
as
much
cash
on
hand
since
september
just
before
election
day
the
rnc's
figures
included
only
money
directly
contributed
to
the
committee
and
did
not
include
money

chairwoman
ronna
mcdaniel
told
fox
news
that
democrats
actually
helped
boost
the
fundraising
totals
thanks
to
boycotts
from
hollywood
liberals
and
the
castro
brothers
doxxing
private
citizens
who
support
president
trump
the
rnc's
fundraising
hit
record
levels
in
august
mcdaniel
said
that
was
a
reference
to
last
month's
decision
by
rep
joaquin
castro
d-texas
to
name
and
shame
trump
donors
publicly
in
san
antonio
a
move
backed
by
his
brother
presidential
candidate
juli
n
castro
it
later
emerged
that
some
of
the
individuals
also
had
donated
to
the
white
house
hopeful
mcdaniel
added
the
more
democrats
demonize
president
trump
and
his
supporters
the
more
boots
we
can
put
on
the
ground
to
re-elect
him
between
the
president's
accomplishments
and
our
grassroots
infrastructure
republicans
are
going
to
be
unstoppable
in
the

is
expected
to
go
partly
toward
an
aggressive
strategy
to
turn
liberal-leaning

red
in
trump
has
been
looking
to
find
the
next
wisconsin
or
michigan
states
that
democrats
generally
have
won
in
presidential
elections
but
that
could
surprise
under
certain
conditions
as
they
did
in
also
on
the
trump
team's
shortlist
nevada
new
hampshire
and
minnesota
to
that
end
trump
hosted
a
fiery
rally
in
blue-leaning
new
mexico
on
monday
then
blitzed
into
california
to
raise
an
estimated
m
on
tuesday
at
high-dollar
fundraisers
the
rnc's
efforts
also
apparently
paid
off
by
the
democrats
own
admission
in
north
carolina
earlier
this
month
when
republicans
swept
two
closely
contested
special
elections
there
the
rnc
had
been
active
on
the
ground
in
north
carolina
working
on
the
special
elections
since
june
the
party
brought
on
nearly
two
dozen
full-time
staffers
and
invested
over
million
in
the
state
while
also
making
nearly
a
half-million
voter
contacts
through
phone-bank
work

door-to-door
canvassing

cheri

acknowledged
that
the

targeted
rally
in
fayetteville
contributed
to
bishop's
win
writing
in
a
statement
we
fell
an
inch
short
tonight
but
it
took
more
than
million
in
outside
republican
spending
and
a
last-minute
trump
rally
to
seal
democratic
candidate
dan
mccready's
fate
in
the
th
district
our
data
told
us
how
many

needed
to
be
made

make
an
informed
