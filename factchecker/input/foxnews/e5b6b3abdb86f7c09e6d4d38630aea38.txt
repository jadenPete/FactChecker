my
candidate
would
be
joe
biden
feinstein
told
cnbc
back
then
i
watched
him
as
vice
president
i've
seen
him
operate
i've
seen
him
perform
and
i
think
he
brings
a
level
of
experience
and
seniority
which
i
think
is
really
important
the
early
evening
reception
will
be
the
first
that
feinstein
hosts
for
biden
in
the
election
cnbc
reported
her
husband
has
already
participated
in
several
fundraising
events
for
biden
who
campaigned
for
feinstein
in
when
she
was
re-elected
by
a
landslide
feinstein
has
repeatedly
faced
questions
about
why
she
prefers
biden
who
was
her
senate
colleague
for
nearly
two
decades
over
harris
her
home
state's
junior
senator
harris
and
biden
famously
butted
heads
during
democratic
presidential
debate
earlier
this
year
when
harris
challenged
biden's
stance
decades
ago
on
the
issue
of
desegregation
school
busing
when
he
was
a
u.s.
senator
from
delaware

brand-new

told
the
los
angeles
times
about
harris
in
january
when
asked
if
she
would
support
a
harris
run
for
the
white
house
it
takes
a
little
bit
of
time
to
get
to
know
somebody
she
also
told
the
washington
examiner
in
may
when
biden
was
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
he
made
her
the
first
woman
to
serve
on
the
panel
i
love
kamala
