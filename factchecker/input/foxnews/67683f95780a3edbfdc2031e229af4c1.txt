outline
of
the
complaint

calls
fake
news
remains
vague
chief
intelligence
correspondent
catherine
herridge
reports
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
reportedly
involved
allegations
president
trump
made
a
troubling
and
unspecified
promise
to
a
foreign
leader
touched
off
a
new
washington
firestorm
on
thursday
as
the
intelligence
community's
top
watchdog
was
questioned
by
congress
on
the
matter
and
the
president
adamantly
denied
the
accusations
the
details
surfaced
overnight
in
a
washington
post
report
but
many
specifics
remain
unclear
including
the
identity
of
the
foreign
leader
trump
looking
like
iran
responsible
for
saudi
oil
attacks
fox
news
has
not
confirmed
the
report
and
white
house
officials
have
not
offered
additional
comment
on
the
claims
but
trump
railed
against
the
post's
reporting
in
a
flurry
of
tweets
that
alleged
his
communications
with
foreign
leaders
were
being
blown
out
of
proportion
another
fake
news
story
out
there
it
never
ends
virtually
anytime
i
speak
on
the
phone
to
a
foreign
leader
i
understand
that
there
may
be
many
people
listening
from
various
u.s.
agencies
not
to
mention
those
from
the
other
country
itself
no
problem
trump
said
knowing
all
of
this
is
anybody
dumb
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
say
something
inappropriate
with
a
foreign
leader
while
on
such
a
potentially
heavily
populated
call
i
would
only
do
what
is
right
anyway
and
only
do
good
for
the
usa
he
capped
off
his
complaint
by
declaring
presidential
harassment
the
post
reported
that
a
u.s.
intelligence
official
filed
the
formal
complaint
in
regard
to
trump's
communications
with
the
unnamed
foreign
leader
north
korea's
kim
invites
trump
to
pyongyang
the
complaint
in
turn
has
triggered
a
showdown
with
congress
after
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
would
not
share
details
of
it
with
lawmakers
those
lawmakers
pressed
intelligence
community
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
for
details
during
thursday's
closed-door
testimony
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
the
associated
press
reported
though
that
he
would
not
discuss
the
substance
of
the
complaint
after
the
testimony
intelligence
committee
chairman
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
voiced
concerns
about
not
having
access
to
the
information
warning
congress
could
use
legal
action
or
budgetary
powers
as
leverage
what's
at
stake
here
goes
well
beyond
this
complaint
and
this
president
he
said
schiff
also
released
letters
from
the
inspector
general
that
revealed
the
watchdog
considered
the
complaint
credible
and
dealing
with
an
urgent
concern
the
letters
revealed
the
office
is
now
at
an
impasse
with
the
director
of
national
intelligence
over
disclosure
atkinson
wrote
that
the
dni
after
consulting
with
the
department
of
justice
determined
the
complaint
does
not
have
to
be
shared
with
the
intelligence
committees
under
law
he
wrote
that
he
will
abide
by
that
determination
but
disagrees
with
it
schiff
earlier
told
cbs
face
the
nation
that
at
least
according
to
the
director
of
national
intelligence
this
involves
an
issue
of
privileged
communications
adding
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
this
involves
either
the
president
or
people
around
him
or
both
he
added
that
if
the
director
of
national
intelligence
is
going
to
undermine
the
whistleblower
protections
it
means
that
people
are
going
to
end
up
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
going
directly
to
the
press
instead
of
the
mechanism
that
congress
set
to
protect
classified
information
schiff
subpoenaed
maguire
saying
he
was
withholding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
and
questioning
whether
he
had
been
directed
to
do
so
by
the
white
house
or
the
attorney
general
in
a
letter
tuesday
the
general
counsel
for
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
jason
klitenic
wrote
that
the
agency
is
protecting
the
whistleblower
and
argued
the
allegation
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
urgent
concern
he
said
the
complaint
concerned
conduct
from
someone
outside
the
intelligence
community
and
did
not
relate
to
intelligence
activity
under
the
dni's
supervision
schiff
said
last
week
that
maguire
is
required
to
share
the
complaint
with
congress
and
said
the
attempt
to
hold
it
back
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct
