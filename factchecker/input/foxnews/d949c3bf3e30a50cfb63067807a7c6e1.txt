democrats
aren't
actually
impeaching
the
president
yet
but
they
are
digging
deep
democrats
at
odds
over
impeachmenthouse
speaker
nancy
pelosi
says
she's
not
going
to
talk
about
it
anymore
as
democrats
struggle
to
define
impeachment
actions
senior
capitol
hill
producer
chad
pergram
reports
muddled
confusing
cryptic
those
are
some
of
the
words
one
could
use
to
describe
what
house
democrats
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
impeachment
impeachment
is
a
very
divisive
issue
said
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-ca
divisive
as
to
what
impeachment
even
means
dems
clash
aty
third
debate
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-ny
tried
to
tamp
down
the
semantic
jousting
at
a
meeting
where
democrats
set
up
parameters
for
an
impeachment
probe
or
something
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
lectured
nadler
the
word
impeachment
is
radioactive
toxic
that's
why
pelosi
bristled
when
reporters
peppered
her
with
questions
about
impeachment
at
her
weekly
press
conference
i'm
not
answering
your
questions
said
a
defiant
pelosi
when
reporters
posed
their
impeachment
interrogatives
i
said
what
i'm
going
to
say
on
the
subject
yet
reporters
continued
to
prod
and
poke
all
on
impeachment
why
is
it
that
you
are
hung
on
the
word
over
here
fumed
pelosi
the
speaker
then
tried
to
pivot
to
an
issue
where
democrats
believe
they
have
the
upper
hand
why
don't
we
spend
some
time
going
over
to
see
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
and
asking
him
why
he
doesn't
want
to
save
lives
scolded
the
speaker
so
is
it
an
impeachment
inquiry
it
has
been
an
impeachment
inquiry
said
nadler
but
you'll
understand
the
confusion
when
asked
if
he
thought
it
was
an
impeachment
inquiry
on
tuesday
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
replied
with
an
emphatic
no
but
a
couple
of
hours
later
hoyer
wasn't
as
declarative
the
leader's
office
sent
out
a
statement
clarifying
comments
at
pen
and
pad
press
conference
hoyer's
mulligan
reads
as
follows
i
thought
the
question
was
in
regards
to
whether
the
full
house
is
actively
considering
articles
of
impeachment
which
they
are
not
at
this
time
said
hoyer
the
investigations
by
six
different
house
committees
into
the
widespread
dishonesty
abuses
of
power
and
corruption
in
the
trump
administration
are
ongoing
i
strongly
support
chairman
nadler
and
the
judiciary
committee
democrats
as
they
proceed
with
their
investigation
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
as
the
resolution
states
it
is
critical
that
congress
have
access
to
all
of
the
relevant
facts
and
we
will
follow
those
facts
wherever
they
lead
including
impeachment
hoyer's
toggling
crystallizes
the
conundrum
facing
democrats
they're
not
quite
sure
what
to
call
the
investigation
by
the
committee
democrats
aren't
actually
impeaching
the
president
yet
but
they
are
digging
deep
rep
al
green
d-tx
has
tried
to
advance
articles
of
impeachment
on
the
house
floor
twice
in
the
past
two
years
but
even
green
wasn't
certain
what
house
democrats
were
doing
i
am
disappointed
in
the
judiciary
committee
because
there
is
no
indication
that
the
president's
bigotry
in
policy
will
be
part
of
their
impeachment
said
green
his
voice
trailing
off
green
was
hunting
for
a
word
or
whatever
they
are
calling
it
finished
green
a
few
seconds
later
triumphantly
exclaiming
impeachment
effort
this
is
why
democrats
are
grousing
behind
closed
doors
liberals
are
worried
they
aren't
doing
enough
on
impeachment
conservative
democrats
will
tell
you
privately
that
impeachment
is
like
a
black
hole
its
gravitational
pull
is
irreversible
once
your
cross
the
political
event
horizon
impeachment
consumes
everything
there's
risk
in
this
impeachment-but-not-impeachment
tactic
for
conservative
democrats
from
swing
districts
rep
anthony
brindisi
d-ny
is
a
case
in
point
he's
a
freshman
democrat
who
flipped
an
upstate
new
york
seat
from
red
to
blue
in
the
midterms
i
would
say
that
as
a
democrat
representing
a
moderate
district
the
voters
sent
me
here
to
get
things
done
health
care
prescription
drugs
infrastructure
i'm
worried
that
as
investigations
ramp
up
it
does
take
attention
away
from
those
issues
rep
donna
shalala
d-fl
is
also
a
freshman
who
seized
a
district
last
year
which
had
been
in
republican
hands
for
decades
she
shares
brindisi's
concerns
on
impeachment
it's
sucking
all
the
air
out
of
the
good
things
we're
doing
said
shalala
but
shalala
conceded
that
democrats
may
have
no
choice
but
to
forge
ahead
with
impeachment
because
it's
a
key
tenet
among
liberals
meantime
the
impeachment
inquest
appears
to
be
a
gift
to
republicans
striving
to
portray
democrats
as
too
extreme
republicans
won't
have
too
much
trouble
doing
that
if
all
of
the
talk
is
about
impeachment
no
wonder
rep
tom
mcclintock
r-ca
said
he
would
double
dog
dare
democrats
to
try
to
impeach
president
trump
that
could
work
to
the
gop's
advantage
the
problem
for
democrats
is
that
the
public
starts
to
interpret
all
of
this
as
impeachment
regardless
of
gymnastics
with
the
lexicon
it
will
soon
be
up
to
pelosi
to
determine
how
far
they
should
go
with
impeachment
but
frankly
the
public
is
the
final
arbiter
voters
will
determine
if
the
democrats
impeachment
scramble
is
the
right
or
wrong
approach
voters
will
make
their
positions
known
at
the
ballot
box
in
months
there
is
also
concern
that
the
democrats
approach
on
impeachment
seeping
into
regular
tv
news
coverage
could
inflame
the
president
lawmakers
and
mr
trump
have
to
reach
an
agreement
soon
to
avoid
a
government
shutdown
there
are
also
questions
about
advancing
gun
legislation
and
the
u.s.
mexico
canada
trade
agreement
usmca
lawmakers
are
concerned
that
talk
about
impeachment
could
incense
the
president
if
impeachment
commands
every
headline
he
sees
on
tv
that
could
upend
potential
accord
on
any
of
those
fronts
remember
president
trump
incinerated
a
meeting
with
democrats
on
infrastructure
in
may
the
president
said
it
was
because
pelosi
was
forging
ahead
with
investigations
and
accused
him
of
corruption
the
word
infrastructure
has
ne'er
been
uttered
at
pennsylvania
avenue
since
does
mr
trump's
unpredictability
concern
hoyer
when
it
comes
to
other
issues
it
damn
well
does
thundered
hoyer
so
this
is
impeachment
no
articles
of
impeachment
are
ready
to
go
to
the
house
floor
or
maybe
ever
but
we
are
in
the
full
gravitational
clutches
of
impeachment
now
in
washington
regardless
of
what
you
call
it
perhaps
jerry
nadler
summed
it
up
best
chatting
with
reporters
monday
night
in
the
speaker's
lobby
just
off
the
house
floor
what
we
are
doing
is
clear
it
has
been
very
clear
it
continues
to
be
very
clear
said
nadler
