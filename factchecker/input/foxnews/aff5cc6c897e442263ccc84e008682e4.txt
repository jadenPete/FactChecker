is
telling
house

d-n

that
if
he
does
not
have
time
to
impeach
supreme

associate

he
should
find
someone
who
does
harris
cited
details
from
a
recent
new
york
times
report
on
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
against
kavanaugh
particularly
those
involving
deborah
ramirez
who
accused
him
of
exposing
himself
to
her
at
a
college
party
nadler
said
monday
in
response
to
being
asked
if
he
would
impeach
kavanaugh
that
his
committee
has
its
hands
full
with
impeaching
president
trump
democrats
ignore
kavanaugh
story
correction
after
demanding
impeachment
i
understand
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
limited
resources
and
many
other
responsibilities
harris
said
in
a
letter
to
nadler
sent
tuesday
however
in
the
past
congressional
committees
have
dedicated
resources
and
established
structures
to
pursue
serious
cases
of
misconduct
including
by
creating
a
task
force
and
retaining
outside
counsel
to
help
lead
impeachment
inquiries
harris
said
kavanaugh's
lifetime
appointment
to
the
supreme
court
warrants
a
similarly
rigorous
approach
ramirez's
allegations
were
known
during
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
but
harris
pointed
to
information
in
the
times
report
to
claim
that
they
were
not
properly
investigated
notably
it
was
reported
that
two
fbi
agents
interviewed
ms
ramirez
about
the
event
and
found
her
credible
but
lacked
authorization
to
review
her
account
any
further
harris
said
citing
the
report
adding
that
ramirez's
lawyers
reportedly
provided
the
fbi
with
at
least
names
of
those
who
could
have
had
corroborating
evidence
only
for
the
fbi
to
interview
none
of
them
now
harris
wants
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
investigate
how
and
why
the
fbi
was
limited
in
the
scope
of
its
investigation
anything
related
from
the
interviews
the
fbi
did
conduct
whether
or
not
kavanaugh
was
truthful
during
the
confirmation
process
and
a
ny
additional
information
that
may
be
provided
by
potential
witnesses
to
the
sexual
assault
allegations
harris
who
is
seeking
the
democratic
nomination
for
the
presidential
election
is
not
the
only

calling
