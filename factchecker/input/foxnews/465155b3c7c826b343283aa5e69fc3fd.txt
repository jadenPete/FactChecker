said
tuesday
that
if
house
democrats
wanted
to
explore
whether
president

deserved
impeachment
a
great
place
to
start
would
be
with

from
michael

the
justice
department
inspector
general
tasked
with
investigating
alleged
abuses
of
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act
fisa
a
great
place

horowitz
claimed
that
comey
the
former

who
was
fired
by

trump
violated
bureau
policies
by
drafting
leaking
and
retaining
his
memos
documenting
private

with
the

republicans
have
maintained
that
comey's
actions
were
part
of
an
anti-trump
agenda
within
the
fbi
prior
to
the
presidential
election

he
had
previously
requested
that
horowitz
appear
before
the
judiciary
committee
only
to
be
rebuffed
by

have
an
opportunity
to
question
mr

jordan
had
said

that
potential

who
was
tapped
by
attorney

in

to
probe
the
origins
of
the

investigation
but
it
will
be
a
while
before
durham's
probe
is
concluded
