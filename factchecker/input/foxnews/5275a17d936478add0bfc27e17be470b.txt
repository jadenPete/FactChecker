where
o'rourke
stands
in
latest
fox
news
poll
legalizing
marijuana
and
ending
the
war
on
drugs
has
long
been
a
crusade
for
o'rouke
dating
back
to
his
days
a
decade
ago
as
an
el
paso
council
member
in
he
co-wrote
a
book
titled
dealing
death
and
drugs
the
big
business
of
dope
in
the
u.s.
and
mexico
and
he
used
the
issue
to
defeat
an
incumbent
democratic
congressman
and
win
election
to
the
house
of
representatives
a
year
later
in
unveiling
his
plan
o'rourke
highlighted
the
toll
the
war
on
drugs
has
taken
on
minority
communities
across
the
country
we
need
to
not
only
end
the
prohibition
on
marijuana
but
also
repair
the
damage
done
to
the
communities
of
color
disproportionately
locked
up
in
our
criminal
justice
system
or
locked
out
of
opportunity
because
of
the
war
on
drugs
he
said
in
a
statement
these
inequalities
have
compounded
for
decades
as
predominantly
white
communities
have
been
given
the
vast
majority
of
lucrative
business
opportunities
while
communities
of
color
still
face
over-policing
and
criminalization
it's
our
responsibility
to
begin
to
remedy
the
injustices
of
the
past
and
help
the
people
and
communities
most
impacted
by
this
misguided
war
he
added
while
president
trump
has
hinted
at
relaxing
strict
federal
marijuana
laws
it's
the
states
that
have
taken
the
lead
eleven
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
legalized
recreational
marijuana
while
states
have
legalized
medical
marijuana
and
have
decriminalized
the
drug
