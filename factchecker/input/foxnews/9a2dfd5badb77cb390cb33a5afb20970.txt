bill
de
blasio's
tenure
as
nyc
mayor
it
breaks
my
heart
de
blasio
entered
the
presidential
race
in
may
running
as
a
proud
progressive
but
his
campaign
never
caught
fire
he
qualified
for
the
first
two
rounds
of
democratic
presidential
debates
but
has
failed
to
make
the
cut
for
the
others
according
to
the
real
clear
politics
average
de
blasio
was
polling
at
less
than
percent
nationally
the
democrat
had
recently
hinted
that
he
would
end
his
long-shot
bid
if
he
didn't
qualify
for
the
october
debates
i'm
going
to
do
everything
i
know
how
to
get
into
them
de
blasio
said
earlier
this
month
but
blasio
faced
an
extremely
uphill
climb
to
meet
the
debate
thresholds
ahead
of
the
oct
qualifying
deadline
president
trump
mocked

the
president
tweeted
part
time

who
was
polling
at
a
solid
zero
but
had
tremendous
room
for
growth
has
shocking
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
race
nyc
is
devastated
he's
coming
home
on
his
campaign's
first
day
de
blasio
dived
into
an
insult
match
with
trump
he's
a
con
artist
i
know
his
tricks
i
know
his
playbook
the
mayor
said
trump
tweeted
in
response
at
the
time
that
de
blasio
was
considered
the
worst
mayor
in
the
u.s.
the
republican
president
said
he
is
a
joke
but
if
you
like
high
taxes
crime
he's
your
man
nyc
hates
him

when
de
blasio
took
office
in
he
seemed
briefly
poised
to
become
a
leading
voice
for
an
emerging
left
wing
of
the
democratic
party
his
central
message
was
fighting
income
inequality
a
theme
he
hit
in
the
video
announcing
his
presidential
candidacy
there's
plenty
of
money
in
this
world
there's
plenty
of
money
in
this
country

wrong
hands
he
said
liberal
enthusiasm
faded
during
his
first
term
partly
because
of
political
missteps
just
this
week
