the
chairman
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
subpoenaed
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
on
friday
claiming
maguire
is
unlawfully
withholding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
possibly
to
protect
the
president
or
top
administration
officials
in
a
statement
schiff
said
that
maguire
would
be
required
to
testify
on
thursday
sept
unless
he
complies
with
the
subpoena
the
lawmaker
did
not
detail
the
subject
of
the
complaint
but
noted
that
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
ic
ig
determined
it
to
be
credible
and
of
urgent
concern
a
director
of
national
intelligence
has
never
prevented
a
properly
submitted
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
ic
ig
determined
to
be
credible
and
urgent
from
being
provided
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
never
schiff
said
this
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct

what's
your
evidence
in
a
letter
to
maguire
accompanying
the
subpoena
schiff
said
the
committee
can
only
conclude
based
on
this
remarkable
confluence
of
factors
that
the
serious
misconduct
at
issue
involves
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
or
other
senior
white
house
or
administration
officials
schiff
added
that
the
complaint
was
filed
a
month
ago
but
his
committee
has
not
received
it
for
review
in
violation
of
the
law
and
had
only
learned
of
its
existence
this
past
monday
the
lawmaker
said
maguire
told
the
committee
in
a
letter
that
he
was
withholding
the
complaint
from
the
committee
because
in
part
it
involves
confidentially
and
potentially
privileged
communications
by
persons
outside
the
intelligence
community
a
senior
intelligence
official
told
the
associated
press
the
intelligence
director's
office
had
received
the
subpoena
and
was
reviewing
it
and
said
maguire
is
committed
to
upholding
whistleblower
protections

it
is
of
vital
importance
that
intelligence
officials
have
a
lawful
and
protected
means
of
bringing
misconduct
to
the
attention
of
congress
and
the
public
schiff
said
in
his
statement
by
withholding
a
credible
whistleblower
complaint
that
potentially
deals
with
executive
branch
wrongdoing
the
director
is
in
violation
of
the
applicable
statute
and
has
made
itself
a
party
to
the
concealment
of
potentially
serious
misconduct
the
intelligence
panel
is
conducting
a
review
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
on
russian
interference
in
the
election
and
obstruction
of
justice
by
the
white
house
the
