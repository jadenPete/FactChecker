radio

dana
loesch
reacts
the
latest
debate
on
gun
control
has
raised
red
flags
on
both
sides
of
the
political
aisle
late
tuesday
evening
the
house
judiciary
committee
passed
three
bills
aimed
at
quelling
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
the
united
states
among
the
bills
was
a
national
version
of
a
mandate
of
extreme
risk
protection
orders
erpos
which
already
is
being
used
in
states
also
known
as
red
flag
laws
erpos
allow
local
authorities
or
family
members
to
take
away
weapons
through
a
court
order
from
any
individual
who
is
a
potential
threat
toward
themselves
or
others
while
the
law
was
passed
by
congress
it
will
likely
stall
on
the
senate
floor
the
proposals
have
ignited
a
debate
about
whether
red
flags
laws
are
effective
erpos
are
an
incredibly
valuable
tool
for
keeping
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
people
intent
on
causing
harm
said
kristen
ellingboe
who
is
with
the
alliance
for
gun
responsibility
which
supports
red
flag
laws
to
fox
news
they
are
effective
in
preventing
mass
shootings
and
suicide

others
warn
that
a
lack
of
data
does
little
to
help
prove
that
red
flag
laws
have
been
effective
in
the
states
that
have
passed
them
it's
hard
to
judge
which
way
the
numbers
really
are
going
said
one
official
within
the
national
rifle
association
nra
if
the
trend
already
shows
a
decline
in
these
states
before
the
laws
were
put
in
place
is
it
actually
because
of
red
flag
laws
or
is
it
because
the
trends
were
already
there

surge

to

washington

such
a
law

via
ap
the
white
house
is
even
considering
a
proposal
recently
presented
by
a
longtime
friend
of
president
trump
former
nbc
chairman
bob
wright
who
suggested
that
a
new
research
arm
called
the
health
advanced
research
projects
agency
harpa
be
developed
to
tackle
health
issues
and
problems
in
the
same
way
that
the
defense
advanced
research
projects
agency
darpa
does
for
the
military
issues
included
in
wright's
proposal
was
a
program
dubbed
safehome
an
acronym
for
stopping
aberrant
fatal
events
by
helping
overcome
mental
extremes
which
would
look
into
technology-
including
smartphones
watches
and
health
trackers-
to
help
detect
when
mentally
ill
people
are
about
to
turn
violent
while
the
technology
has
not
been
developed
as
of
yet
the
mere
mention
of
the
possibility
of
using
people's
devices
to
monitor
their
potential
for
violence
has
left
many
troubled
by
the
prospects
beto's

flip-flop
o'rourke
once
vowed
nobody
wants
to
seize
guns
i
would
love
if
some
new
technology
suddenly
came
along
that
would
help
us
identify
violent
risk
but
there's
so
many
things
about
this
idea
of
predicting
violence
that
doesn't
make
sense
said
marisa
randazzo
former
chief
research
psychologist
for
the
u.s.
secret
service
to
the
washington
post
noting
not
only
concerns
about
civil
liberty
but
also
about
the
potential
for
false
positives
even
without
the
use
of
technology
ellingboe
said
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
collect
data
on
the
exact
number
of
gun
tragedies
that
are
prevented
but
that
estimates
suggest
for
every
to
firearms
secured
with
a
red
flag
law
one
suicide
is
prevented
in
king
county
alone
at
least
firearms
were
secured
through
the
erpo
process
in
so
the
impact
is
substantial
she
said
a
pair
of
recent
studies
in
indiana
and
connecticut
respectively
suggest
that
suicides
have
gone
down
after
those
states
red
flag
laws
were
enacted
other
nra
officials
also
cited
a
study
that
detailed
the
circumstances
behind
the
use
of
red
flag
laws
in
connecticut
saying
that
there
are
some
concerns
with
the
findings-
mainly
the
low
number
of
people
who
actually
received
mental
health
treatment
after
their
weapons
were
seized
as
a
result
of
that
state's
red
flag
law
among
the
many
failures
of
connecticut's
red
flag
law
it
doesn't
provide
comprehensive
and
compassionate
treatment
to
those
suffering
from
a
mental
health
crisis
nra
spokesperson
catherine
mortensen
said
in
a
statement
to
fox
news
in
fact
less
than
one-third
of
those
impacted
by
red
flag
received
mental
health
treatment
after
their
firearms
were
seized
this
law
strips
law-abiding
citizens
of
their
second
amendment
rights
without
due
process
we
need
meaningful
approaches
to
reducing
violence
that
includes
fixing
our
broken
mental
health
system
while
keeping
our
freedoms
intact
this
law
accomplishes
neither
of
those
goals
but
ellingboe
of
the
alliance
for
gun
responsibility
said
that
there's
sufficient
evidence
that
the
laws
are
effective
just
last
week
an
erpo
was
used
to
secure
guns
from
a
maryland
man
who
threatened
a
workplace
shooting
she
said
last
year
vermont's
law
helped
thwart
a
planned
school
shooting
and
earlier
this
summer
oregon
authorities
issued
an
erpo
against
a
man
who
threatened
protesters
since
august
the
push
for
red
flag
laws
has
been
gaining
momentum
especially
since
trump
has
thrown
his
support
behind
them

support
strong
meaningful
background
checks
where
people
who
are
insane
mentally
ill
where
people
like
that
should
not
have
guns
trump
said
during
an
august
rally
in
new
hampshire
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
person
that
pulls
the
trigger
