is
toe-to-toe
with
biden
for
first
time
democratic
presidential
rivals
chase
joe
biden
ahead
of
debatefrontrunner
joe
biden
still
leads
in
the
polls
but
elizabeth
warren
has
narrowed
the
gap
peter
doocy
reports
from
houston
a
surging
sen
elizabeth
warren
will
have
her
first
chance
to
confront
primary
frontrunner
joe
biden
on
the
debate
stage
thursday
night
as
the
top
democrats
running
for
president
square
off
in
houston
at
a
critical
moment
in
the
race
the
former
vice
president
has
maintained
his
status
atop
the
primary
polls
but
warren
d-mass
has
seen
her
numbers
and
crowd
sizes
grow
in
recent
weeks
they
have
not
appeared
together
on
the
same
debate
stage
until
now
the
other
top-tier
democratic
contender
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
who
like
warren
represents
the
progressive
and
populist
wing
of
the
party
will
also
be
in
houston
hours
before
the
debate
warren
proposes
a
social
security
boost
of
per
month
but
much
of
the
buzz
heading
into
thursday
night
has
focused
on
the
two
hopefuls
standing
center
stage
biden
and
warren
two
big
questions
heading
into
the
debate
will
the
two
candidates
who
come
from
very
different
wings
of
the
democratic
party
take
aim
at
each
other
during
the
nationally
televised
prime-time
showdown
and
can
warren
who
until
now
has
not
faced
much
direct
criticism
from
top-tier
candidates
during
debates
take
the
heat
biden
campaign
officials
previewed
some
fireworks
arguing
ahead
of
the
debate
that
the
field
needs
more
than
just
plans
we
need
action
it
was
an
implicit
swipe
at
warren
who
famously
has
developed
detailed
action
plans
for
a
wide
range
of
issues
warren
and
biden
have
taken
subtle
jabs
at
each
other
in
recent
weeks
there
is
a
lot
at
stake
and
people
are
scared
warren
emphasized
last
weekend
in
an
address
at
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party's
annual
convention
as
she
noted
the
urgency
of
defeating
president
trump
in
the
election
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
shot
at
biden
who
has
made
electability
a
key
part
of
his
white
house
bid
warren
said
we
can't
choose
a
candidate
we
don't
believe
in
because
we're
scared
trump
campaign
flying
banner
over
debate
site
blasting
democrats
as
socialists
last
week
biden
appeared
to
take
aim
at
warren
during
a
high-profile
climate
change
forum
televised
on
national
cable
tv
saying
plans
are
great
but
executing
on
those
plans
is
a
very
different
thing
warren
has
released
one
progressive
policy
proposal
after
another
during
her
presidential
campaign
and
is
known
for
saying
i
have
a
plan
for
that
asked
about
biden's
comment
warren
told
reporters
i
think
we
start
with
a
plan
and
then
we
get
out
there
and
fight
for
it
to
me
that's
what
being
president
is
all
about
dems
who
failed
to
make
debate
stage
vow
to
press
on
due
to
the
luck
of
the
draw
biden
and
warren
have
not
yet
appeared
on
the
same
stage
during
the
first
two
rounds
of
debates
for
each
of
the
first
two
rounds
the
field
of
some
candidates
was
split
in
half
for
debate
events
over
two
consecutive
nights
but
with
the
field
shrinking
and
criteria
toughening
all
candidates
who
made
the
cut
for
this
matchup
will
share
a
stage
for
a
single-night
debate
thursday
hosted
by
abc
warren
has
so
far
refrained
from
painting
contrasts
with
her
top
rivals
for
the
nomination
she
told
fox
news
on
saturday
that
i'm
not
here
to
criticize
any
other
democrat
or
anyone
else's
campaign
i'm
here
to
talk
about
what
i'm
running
for
as
president
biden's
camp
has
signaled
that
he's
unlikely
to
lead
the
charge
against
warren
let's
be
clear
there
will
be
candidates
on
the
debate
stage
not
two
and
regardless
of
who
is
or
isn't
attacking
joe
biden
biden
is
focused
on
running
his
race
a
senior
biden
adviser
told
fox
news
this
week
democratic
strategists
agree
veteran
democratic
strategist
zac
petkanas
predicted
that
they
are
very
likely
to
leave
each
other
alone
petkanas
who
served
as
the
hillary
clinton
campaign's
director
of
rapid
response
in
the
race
noted
that
while
some
in
the
biden
camp
are
sending
signals
that
the
former
vice
president
may
paint
contrasts
with
warren
i
doubt
very
much
that
the
candidates
themselves
are
going
to
get
into
a
scrape
elizabeth
warren
has
done
extremely
well
by
staying
above
the
fray
he
added
she
is
the
little
engine
that
continues
to
climb
and
build
a
strong
foundation
of
support
that
is
going
to
help
her
win
the
nomination
but
strategic
communications
consultant
ben
labolt
who
served
as
national
press
secretary
for
president
barack
obama's
reelection
campaign
isn't
ruling
out
some
friction
between
biden
and
warren
i
think
she
signaled
she's
willing
to
take
the
fight
not
only
to
trump
but
to
compete
as
hard
as
she
needs
to
win
the
primary
he
noted
inevitably
campaigns
are
about
laying
out
choices
democrats
should
not
go
below
the
belt
in
attacking
each
other
or
damaging
potential
nominees
irrevocably
but
i
do
expect
some
level
of
contrast
between
the
candidates
in
this
debate
biden
has
faced
incoming
fire
from
his
rivals
on
the
debate
stage
the
past
two
rounds
and
thursday
night's
showdown
should
be
no
different
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
pile-on
on
joe
biden
and
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
petkanas
said
a
lot
of
the
other
campaigns
believe
that
his
support
is
soft
and
is
moveable
biden
was
coldcocked
by
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
in
the
first
round
in
late
june
and
he
weathered
repeated
jabs
from
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
and
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
of
new
york
who
dropped
out
of
the
race
last
month
in
late
july's
second
round
the
reality
is
joe
biden
needs
to
come
down
in
support
if
we're
going
to
see
other
candidates
increase
their
support
petkanas
noted
labolt
empathized
that
the
other
candidates
on
thursday's
debate
stage
have
a
choice
to
make
will
they
focus
solely
on
laying
out
the
case
or
will
they
take
the
contrast
not
only
to
trump
but
to
those
candidates
eating
up
the
largest
portion
of
their
potential
vote
share
he
said
warren
remained
unscathed
in
the
first
round
of
debates
but
she
and
sanders
faced
attacks
by
more
centrist
lower-tier
candidates
over
their
progressive
proposals
specifically
the
medicare-for-all
proposal
during
the
second
round
with
no
let-up
in
warren's
rise
she's
now
all
tied
up
with
sanders
for
second
place
behind
biden
in
nearly
every
recent
poll
expect
her
along
with
sanders
to
face
more
criticism
labolt
said
that
while
biden
has
been
a
focus
of
attacks
other
candidates
may
have
a
better
shot
peeling
off
support
from
warren
or
sanders
how
they
engage
with
others
on
the
stage
will
be
the
most
interesting
chess
match
of
the
evening
