new
york
times
criticized
from
both
sides
over
now-revised
kavanaugh
allegations
late
sunday
the
new
york
times
walked
back
an
explosive
report
about
a
resurfaced
allegation
of
sexual
assault
by
kavanaugh
from
his
college
days
the
piece
by
robin
pogrebin
and
kate
kelly
adapted
from
their
forthcoming
book
alleged
there
was
corroboration
of
an
incident
in
which
kavanaugh
as
a
college
student
at
yale
exposed
himself
to
a
female
classmate
at
a
party
however
the
federalist's
mollie
hemingway
who
reviewed
an
advance
copy
of
the
book
flagged
an
omission
and
the
paper
eventually
revised
the
controversial
story
after
being
lampooned
on
social
media
over
the
gaffe
the
update
included
the
significant
detail
that
several
friends
of
the
alleged
victim
said
she
did
not
recall
the
purported
sexual
assault
the
newspaper
also
stated
for
the
first
time
that
the
alleged
victim
refused
to
be
interviewed
and
has
made
no
other
comment
about
the
episode

trump
was
asked
about
whether
anyone
from
the
times
should
be
fired
over
the
controversy
he
called
it
a
fair
question
but
didn't
directly
give
an
answer
i
think
the
new
york
times
made
another
terrible
mistake
trump
said
it's
a
shame
that
a
thing
like
that
could
happen
they
used
to
have
a
thing
called
fact-checking
they
don't
have
fact-checking
anymore
