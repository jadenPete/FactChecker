declared

that

is
not
engaged
in

other
top
democrats
including
house

committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
have
repeatedly
insisted
in
court
and
in
public
that
an
impeachment
inquiry
is
in
progress
the
apparent
confusion
in
the
caucus
comes
as
nadler
plans
a
markup
session
thursday
to
lay
out
the
parameters
of
a
resolution
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
it
has
been
an
impeachment
inquiry
nadler
said
earlier
this
week
what
we
are
doing
is
clear
it
has
been
very
clear
it
continues
to
be
very
clear
guns
impeachment

what's
on
tap
for
this
session
of

but
when
asked
if
he
thought
it
was
an
impeachment
inquiry
hoyer
responded
with
an
emphatic
no
hoyer
added
i
think
the
delineation
ought
to
be
whether
or
not
they
are
considering
a
resolution
of
impeachment
i
don't
want
to
be
simplistic
about
it
but
i
don't
want
to
quibble
on
words
either
hoyer
said
but
in
impeachment
what
you
imply
is
the
consideration
of
an
impeachment
resolution
and
a
vote
on
the
resolution
that's
not
currently
before
the
committee
what's
before
the
committee
is
this
ongoing
investigation
separately
house
democratic
caucus
chairman

d-n
y.
also
refused
to
say
clearly
whether
there
was
an
impeachment
inquiry
later
in
the
afternoon
hoyer
backpedaled
and
said
he
had
misunderstood
the
question
he
was
asked
his
office
sent
out
a
statement
clarifying
comments
at
pen
and
pad
press
conference
hoyer's
mulligan
read
i
thought
the
question
was
in
regards
to
whether
the
full
house
is
actively
considering
articles
of
impeachment
which
we
are
not
at
this
time
the
investigations
by
six
different
house
committees
into
the
widespread
dishonesty
abuses
of
power
and
corruption
in
the
trump
administration
are
ongoing
i
strongly
support
chairman
nadler
and
the
judiciary
committee
democrats
as
they
proceed
with
their
investigation
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
as
the
resolution
states
hoyer
continued
it
is
critical
that
congress
have
access
to
all
of
the
relevant
facts
and
we
will
follow
those
facts
wherever
they
lead
including
impeachment
