evans
resigned
from
his
role
as
the
chairman
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
authority
board
this
summer
after
an
internal
investigation
determined
that
he
failed
to
disclose
a
profitable
conflict
of
interest
but
committee
democrats
denied
his
request
he
said
sadly
the
allegations
against
mr
evans
are
just
the
latest
in
a
series
of
local

political
scandals
jordan
said
ticking
off
several
former

embroiled
in
past

we
cannot
and
should
not
ignore

the

the

pushed
back
against

the

nothing

the
d.c.
statehood
bill
has
more
than
co-sponsors
and
the
support
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
both
democrats
no
republicans
in
congress
have
signed
on
to
the
legislation
the
bill
calls
for
districtwide
elections
of
two
senators
and
one
house
representative
it
says
all
district
territory
would
be
included
in
the
declaration
save
for
specific
exclusions
of
federal
buildings
and
monuments
such
as
the
white
house
and
the
capitol
democrats
argued
statehood
is
needed
because
d.c.
residents
lack
adequate
representation
in
congress
d.c.
residents
have
all
of
the
responsibilities
of
citizenship
but
they
have
no
congressional
voting
rights
and
only
limited
self-government
the
democratic
committee
chairman
rep
elijah
cummings
of
maryland
said
in
a
prepared
statement
which
was
read
by
holmes
norton
at
the
hearing
republicans
said
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
for
the
nation's
capital
to
be
a
federal
district
this
is
not
what
the
founding
fathers
intended
jordan
said
they
understood
and
they
carefully
crafted
the
constitution
so
that
the
seat
of
the
federal
government
would
purposely
and
specifically
not
be
within
a
state
if
d.c.
were
to
become
a
state
democrats
would
likely
gain
two
new
senators
and
one
house
representative

reality
which
has
played
into
the
political
motivations
behind
supporting
or
opposing
it

senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
of
kentucky
has
vowed
to
oppose
the
statehood
bill
speaking
to
fox
news
laura
ingraham
this
summer
mcconnell
said
democrats
want
d.c.
statehood
so
they
can
get
two
new
democratic
senators
and
said
as
long
as
i'm
the
majority
leader
of
the
senate
none
of
that
stuff
is
going
anywhere
even
if
that
bill
passed
through
congress
it
would
almost
certainly
be
challenged
in
court
with
some
legal
scholars
saying
it
would
require
a
constitutional
amendment
to
be
implemented
the
rd
amendment
currently
gives
d.c.
the
right
to
vote
for
president
in
order
for
the
district
to
become
the
fifty-first
state
congress
needs
to
pass
and
the
states
need
to
ratify
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
