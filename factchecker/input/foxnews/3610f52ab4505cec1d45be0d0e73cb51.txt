beto
o'rourke
launched
an
expletive-fueled
defense
of
his
call
sunday
to
ban
assault-style
weapons
and
impose
mandatory
buybacks
of
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
while
also
pushing
back
at
critics
including
fellow
democrat
pete
buttigieg
during
last
thursday's
presidential
debate
the
former
texas
congressman
said
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
your
fellow
americans
anymore
three
days
later
o'rourke
appeared
on
nbc
news
meet
the
press
where
host
chuck
todd
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
lot
of
hand-wringing
about
the
presidential
contender's
full-throated
call
on
national
tv
for
confiscating
such
rifles
as
o'rourke
has
put
the
issue
of
gun
violence
at
the
center
of
his
campaign
effort
some
fellow
democrats
have
chastised
him
and
expressed
concern
that
his
statements
may
have
made
things
harder
for
gun
control
supporters
as
they
negotiate
with
president
trump
on
legislation
to
respond
to
this
summer's
mass
shootings
o'rourke
claims
trump
has
blood
on
his
hands
after
el
paso
mass
shooting
after
todd
pointed
out
that
some
democrats
were
hesitant
to
support
such
bans
o'rourke
responded
i
think
this
just
shows
you
how
screwed
up
the
priorities
in
washington
d.c.
are
he
then
brought
up
the
people
killed
in
a
walmart
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
last
month
talking
to
those
doctors
and
trauma
room
surgeons
who
treated
those
victims
in
el
paso
they
said
these
are
wounds
of
war
that
high-impact
high-velocity
round
when
it
hit
their
systems
just
shredded
everything
inside
of
them
o'rourke
said
on
sunday
i
refuse
to
accept
that
and
i
refuse
to
even
acknowledge
the
politics
or
the
polling
or
the
fear
of
the
nra
that
has
purchased
the
complicity
and
silence
of
members
of
congress
and
this
weak
response
to
a
real
tragedy
in
america
el
paso
shooting
fatalities
now
at
after
victim
dies
at
hospital
monday
morning
police
say
buttigieg
the
mayor
of
south
bend
ind
appeared
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
and
agreed
with
sen
chris
coons
d-del
saying
the
clip
of
the
former
o'rourke's
statement
about
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
buttigieg
said
look
right
now
we
have
an
amazing
moment
on
our
hands
we
have
agreement
among
the
american
people
not
just
for
universal
backgrounds
checks
but
we
have
a
majority
in
favor
of
red-flag
laws
high-capacity
magazines
banning
the
new
sale
of
assault
weapons
this
is
a
golden
moment
to
finally
do
something
buttigieg
went
on
to
say
when
even
this
president
and
even
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
are
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hand
let's
make
the
most
of
it
and
get
these
things
done
o'rourke
pushed
back
in
a
tweet
leaving
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
because
trump
and
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
that
calculation
and
fear
is
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
let's
have
the
courage
to
say
what
we
believe
and
fight
for
it
he
later
tweeted
when
candidates
say
at
least
donald
trump
and
mitch
mcconnell
are
pretending
to
be
interested
sh-
that
is
not
enough
neither
is
poll-testing
your
message
gun
violence
is
a
life
or
death
issue
and
we
have
to
represent
the
bold
ideas
of
people
all
over
the
country
as
o'rourke
made
his
call
to
take
back
the
rifles
on
thursday
night
trump
warned
at
a
republican
retreat
in
baltimore
democrats
want
to
confiscate
guns
from
law-abiding
americans
so
they
are
totally
defenseless
when
somebody
walks
into
their
house
trump
promised
that
his
party
will
forever
uphold
the
fundamental
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
which
received
loud
applause
