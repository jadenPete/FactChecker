trump
administration
prepares
major
rollback
of
obama-era
water
rules
the
rule
has
been
a
target
since
the
beginning
of
president

first
term
in
he
signed
an
executive
order
directing
the
agency
to
reconsider
the
rule
and
abide
by
supreme
court
justice
antonin
scalia's
plurality
opinion
in
a
case
on
the
issue
that
ruling
in
rapanos
vs
united
states
restricted
the
federal

regulatory
authority
to
bodies
of
water
with
a

streams
ponds
ditches
and
even
depressions
fields
that
are
dry
through
most
of
the

a

similarly
described
the

as
a
power
grab

on
thursday
in
an
unprecedented
power
grab
this
rule
handed
federal
bureaucrats
authority
to
regulate
almost
any
water
imaginable
creating
unnecessary
regulatory
obstacles
for
everyone
from
farmers
plowing
their
land
to
local
governments
building
ditches
for
public
safety
to
families
building
their
homes
bakst
argued
while
it's
unclear
exactly
what
the
new
rule
will
say
environmental
groups
have
panned
the
idea
as
a
threat
to
the
nation's
waterways
when
the

would
publish
the

protected
important
waterways
and
wetlands

certainty
to
