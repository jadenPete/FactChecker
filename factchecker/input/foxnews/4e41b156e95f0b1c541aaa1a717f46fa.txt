two
mass

no
problem
with

put
the
gun
debate
in
texas
a
state
considered
a
gun
rights
bastion
center
stage
it
will
likely
be
a
hot
topic
during
thursday's
debate
in
houston
some
democratic
candidates
have
called
on
texas
lawmakers
to
take
action
ahead
of
the
debates
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
julian
castro
criticized
republican
lawmakers
after
several
laws
easing
restrictions
on
gun
owners
took
effect
in
the
beginning
of
the
month
greg
abbott
and
the
rest
of
them
have
been
total
failures
when
it
comes
to
preventing
mass
shootings
in
texas
said
castro
on
friday
gov
greg
abbott
signed
eight
executive
orders
to
try
to
head
off
potential
mass
shooters
by
focusing
on
reporting
suspicious
activity
texas
must
achieve
several
objectives
to
better
protect
our
communities
and
our
residents
from
mass
shootings
abbott
said
one
of
those
objectives
is
to
marshal
law
enforcement
resources
to
stop
violent
criminals
before
they
commit
mass
murders
gov
greg
abbott
signed
eight
executive
orders
to
stop
potential
mass
shooters
last
week
it
came
less
than
one
week
after
several
laws
easing
restrictions
on
gun
owners
took
effect
fox

lt
gov
dan
patrick
suggested
closing
a
loophole
in
background
checks
there
is
no
need
for
a
stranger
to
sell
another
gun
to
a
stranger
that's
irresponsible
and
the
nra
needs
to
get
behind
that
that's
where
republican
voters
are
that's
where
many
republican
legislators
are
and
i
believe
that
can
pass
congress
patrick
said
texas
lt
gov
dan
patrick
willing
to
take
an
arrow
in
bucking
nra
on
background
checks
but
abbott
has
not
budged
on
state
democrats
calls
for
a
special
legislative
session
to
address
gun
violence
the
legislature
does
not
convene
again
until
governor
abbott
should
call
a
special
session
right
now
and
he
can
do
that
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
unless
he's
willing
to
do
that
he's
just
talking
saying
what
he
thinks
he
has
to
say
as
a
politician
so
that
he
doesn't
get
beaten
up
in
castro

political
experts
say
gun
safety
will
likely
be
a
wedge
issue
particularly
for
women
and
college-educated
voters
in
texas
in
ktbc
democrats
are
hoping
to
pull
off
a
upset
in
texas
gun
reform
will
likely
remain
a
top
issue
in
texas
as
democrats
approach
it
as
a
key
battleground
state
in
beyond
the
democratic
primary
the
subject
could
also
influence
next
year's
general
election
in
which
the
dems
will
aim
to
unseat
president
trump
as
the
suburbs
change
in
texas
it's
going
to
change
the
issue
dynamics
said
brandon
rottinghaus
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
houston
if
republicans
continue
to
be
as
stringent
on
gun
issues
as
they
have
been
it's
going
to
a
problem
for
them
to
win
those
swing
voters
to
make
sure
texas
stays
red
