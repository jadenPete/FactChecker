she'll

as
hillary

did
in

concern
of

of

democrats
in

that
in

of

warren
underperforms
they
are
demographically
and
culturally
similar
to

in

swing

said
state
rep
john
rogers
who
backs
biden
warren's
critics
have
long
assailed
the

professor
for
being
too
far
liberal
and
too
out-of-touch
with

beat

nope
nope
oh

how
much
to

pay
attention
and
that
alleviates
the

i
often
feel
when
i
look
at

keep

i
love
that
you
are

honest
in

i
don't
belong

let's
face
it
people
are
people
and
i
think
we
often
lose
our
ability
to
think
clearly
because
we
just
want

to

know
that
with
you

outlook
it's
not
every
day
a
man
tries
to
fight
a
grizzly
bear
but
it
appears
that
is
what
happened
in
banff
canadian
national
park
in
when
devin
mitsuing
got
out
of
his
truck
shirtless
and
began
shouting
at
the
young
grizzly
while
in
a
boxing
stance
before
charging
at
it
according
to
an
eyewitness
to
the
incident
caught
on
camera
by
a
couple
of
nearby
photographers
who
were
taking
pictures
of
the
lone
grazing
grizzly
on
highway
and
called
the
royal
canadian
mounted
police
after
the
incident
mitsuing
was
later
located
in
radium
b.c.
by
rcmp
and
a
park
warden
and
charged
under
the
national
parks
act
for
disturbing
wildlife
in
a
national
park
after
two
previous
missed
court
dates
the
case
finally
came
to
trial
in
the
canmore
provincial
courthouse
friday
sept
morning
with
judge
george
gaschler
finding
the
saskatchewan
man
guilty
and
imposing
a
fine
and
now
a
word
from
charles
it's
a
future
hope
but
amid
dire
circumstances
by
then
iran
will
be
flush
with
cash
legitimized
as
a
normal
international
actor
in
good
standing
recognized
as
obama
once
said
as
a
very
successful
regional
power
stopping
iran
from
going
nuclear
at
that
point
will
be
infinitely
more
difficult
and
risky
