president
trump
sent
liberal
california
activists
into
a
tizzy
on
tuesday
as
he
executed
a
lunch-dinner-breakfast-lunch
fundraising
blitz
expected
to
scoop
up
million
from
wealthy
republicans
in
the
state
in
the
span
of
just
two
days
a
firestorm
among
hollywood
elites
erupted
last
month
as
soon
as
trump's
emmy-week
visit
to
the
golden
state
was
announced
with
will
and
grace
star
debra
messing
suggesting
that
anyone
attending
the
fundraising
events
should
be
named
and
shamed
publicly
that
prompted
trump
to
call
messing
a
failed
actress
dabbling
in
racism
and
mccarthyism
the
president's
undeterred
push
westward
came
a
day
after
he
headlined
a
fiery
rally
in
new
mexico
long
a
reliably
liberal
state
that
the
trump
campaign
has
hoped
to
turn
red
in
trump
has
been
looking
to
find
the
next
wisconsin
or
michigan
states
that
democrats
generally
have
won
in
presidential
elections
but
that
could
surprise
under
certain
conditions
as
they
did
in
also
on
the
trump
team's
shortlist
in
the
new
strategy
nevada
new
hampshire
and
minnesota
california
is
decidedly
not
on
that
list
nevertheless
republican
strategists
said
the
state
could
still
be
useful
even
if
not
for
its
electoral
votes
there's
not
been
a
president
in
living
history
that
is
as
unpopular
in
the
state
of
california
as
trump
said

consultant
and
outspoken

critic
but
our
money
spends
the
same
as
everyone
else's

kicked
off
his

tuesday

we
can't

happening

added
the

are
fed
up

we're
looking
at

be

about

los

mayor
eric
garcetti
a
democrat
said
in
a
facebook
video
post
ahead
of
trump's
arrival
that
he
hoped
the
president
would
work
with
the
city
to
end
homelessness
he
said
he
had
not
been
invited
to
meet
with
the
president
the
mayor
was
speaking
at
one
of
an
eventual

built

transition
people
from
life
on

streets
president
trump
we
have
to
press
pause
on
politics
confront
the
homelessness
crisis
and
save
lives
now
garcetti
said
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
a
little
bit
as
if
he
had
come
down
here
to
south
la
to
understand
and
to
hear
the
challenges
we
face
and
ways
that
washington
d.c.
instead
of
demonizing
us
might
be
able
to
actually
come
and
help
us
garcetti
also
pushed
back
on
a
trump
assertion
in
a
july
interview
that
homelessness
was
a
phenomenon
that
began
two
years
ago
i'd
like
to
reassure
the
president
it
didn't
start
two
years
ago
when
you
became
president
it
didn't
even
start
six
years
ago
when
i
became
mayor
but
it
is
our
collective
watch
and
our
collective
responsibility
to
solve
this
however
garcetti
separately
sounded
a
conciliatory
tone
when
he
spoke
to
reporters
i
know
i'm
just
supposed
to
punch
the
president
back
but
if
he
is
real
about
it
i'll
believe
it
when
i
see
it
but
i'll
also
trust
that
he
wants
to
save
some
lives
as
well
the
mayor
said
certainly
i
do
we
could
do
that
together

because

for
gender
reassignment
california
was
seen
as
an
incubator
for
the
modern
conservative
movement
that
swept
the
state's
former
governor
ronald
reagan
into
the
white
house
in
but
demographic
changes
and
an
influx
of
immigrants
and
new
residents
have
helped
rework
the
political
contours
of
the
country's
most
populated
state
drastically
with
the
former
gop
stronghold
of
orange
county
having
more
registered
democrats
than
republicans
as
of
this
summer
for
republicans
who
have
been
resigned

political
irrelevance

the

level

california
has
long
been
a
key
fundraising
hotbed
for
politicians
of
both
parties
which
have
relied
on
wealthy
industry
heads
and
hollywood
to
help
finance
their
political
ambitions
but
under
trump
the
run-of-the-mill
fundraising
trip
has
taken
on
a
complicating
dimension
because
of
his
harsh
criticism
of
the
state's
immigration
laws
and
its
forest
management
practices
which
he
blamed
in
part
for
deadly
wildfires
earlier
this
month
trump
fired
back
at
messing
after
she
tweeted
that
attendees
of
the
trump's
california
fundraisers
should
be
outed
publicly
following
a
similar
push
from
costar
eric

trump
tweeted
back
i
have
not
forgotten
that

trump
took
aim
at
the
state's
massive

industry
calling
hollywood
very
dangerous
for
our
country
he
added
hollywood

terrible
