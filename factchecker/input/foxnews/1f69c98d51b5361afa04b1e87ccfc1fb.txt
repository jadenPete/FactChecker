the
u.s.
military
has
spent
more
than
at
president
trump's
luxury
resort
in
scotland
over
the
past
two
years
according
to
documents
the
pentagon
provided
to
the
house
oversight
committee
the
committee
which
announced
the
figure
wednesday
is
investigating
whether
overnight
stays
by
air
force
crews
at
the
trump
turnberry
resort
during
refueling
stops
at
nearby
glasgow
prestwick
airport
violate
the
emoluments
clause
which
prohibits
government
payments
to
the
president
outside
of
his
salary
trump
said
on
twitter
monday
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
crews
stays
at
the
resort
congressional
democrats
are
also
probing
refueling
expenditures
at
the
airport
which
amounted
to
million
between
trump's
inauguration
and
june
of
this
year
air
force
says
vast
majority
of
crews
overnight
glasgow
stays
weren't
at

called
the
pentagon's
response
to
their
requests
for
information
woefully
inadequate
in
a
letter
to
defense
secretary
mark
esper
cummings
and
raskin
summarized
that
the
military
used
taxpayer
dollars
to
purchase
more
than
rooms
at
trump
turnberry
since
august
or
the
equivalent
of
one
room
every
night
for
more
than
one-and-a-half
years
based
on
the
pages
of
documents
provided
to
them
which
they
say
paint
an
incomplete
picture
of
the
spending
the
air
force
told
the
committee
in
a
letter
dated
sept
that
expenditures
specifically
associated
with
the
trump
turnberry
amounted
to
but
have
failed
to
provide
specific
invoices
or
travel
records

the
military
also
spent
an
additional
in
unspecified
charges
to
government
travel
cards
the
dod
said
the
department
also
told
the
committee
that
it
spent
per
gallon
for
fuel
at
the
airport
an
advantageous
rate
when
compared
to
the
going
commercial
rate
but
the
committee
said
the
figures
did
not
provide
any
information
on
the
contemporaneous
fuel
rates
at
non-commercial
sites
such
as
military
bases
elsewhere
in
europe
it
is
unclear
why
the
department
has
taken
so
long
to
produce
such
rudimentary
and
deficient
information

the
lawmakers
added
that
the
pentagon's
response
still
reveals
that
far
more
taxpayer
funds
have
been
spent
at
the
president's
resort
than
previously
known
the
data
provided
by
the
department
now
indicates
that
u.s.
taxpayer
funds
have
been
used
to
pay
for
more
than
three
dozen
separate
stays
involving
hundreds
of
nights
of
rooms
all
after
the
president
was
sworn
into
office
a
preliminary
review
by
the
air
force
revealed
that
its
flight
crews
stayed
at
the
resort
up
to
times
between
and
an
official
told
fox
news
last
week
congress
has
demanded
that
the
pentagon
provide
invoices
documents
contracts
agreements
and
internal
and
external
communications
regarding
travel
and
