pete

proposes
public
option
says
it
could
naturally
lead
to
medicare-for-all
buttigieg
sometimes
the
boldest
idea
doesn't
have
to
be
the
most
polarizing

following
the
debate
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
unveiled
a
medicare
for
all
who
want
it
plan
that
would
offer
a
government-backed
option
for
consumers
alongside
price
controls
geared
toward
protecting
people
who
maintain
their
private
plans
the
plan
released
on
thursday
represents
an
attempt
by
buttigieg
to
distance
himself
from
other
democratic
candidates
medicare-for-all
plans
that
would
effectively
kick
americans
off
their
private
insurance
with
a
price
tag
of
trillion
over
a
decade
buttigieg
of
south
bend
claims
to
guarantee
universal
care
like
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
while
bolstering
subsidies
for
low-income
individuals
the
campaign
says
a
buttigieg
administration
would
pay
for
the
public
option
which
includes
automatic
and
retroactive
enrollment
for
anyone
without
a
private
plan
by
repealing
trump's
tax
cuts
and
seeking
cost
savings
through
administrative
reforms
my
approach
isn't
just
the
right
thing
to
do
for
americans
it
will
bring
us
together
rather
than
push
us
even
further
apart
so
we
can
achieve
our
bold
objective
of
universal
affordable
health
care

op-ed
published
thursday
pelosi
comes
out
against
medicare-for-all
tells
democrats
to
follow
obamacare
blueprint
it's
unclear
how
long
americans
could
maintain
their
private
insurance
under
buttigieg's
plan
though
as
he's
already
reinforced
conservative
fears
about
a
public
option
providing
unfair
and
ultimately
destructive
competition
for
private
companies
if
private
insurers
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
offer
better
plans
than
they
do
today
competition
from
this
public
alternative
will
naturally
lead
to
medicare-for-all
he
said
nina
schaefer
a
senior
research
fellow
at
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
was
more
certain
the
plan
would
inevitably
lead
to
a
single-payer
system
the
end
result
will
still
be
the
same
he's
just
doing
it
in
what
he
perceives
the
american
people
will
see
as
a
more
modest
approach
to
it
she
told
fox
news
sally
pipes
washington
gov
jay
inslee's
public
option
amounts
to
single-payer
in
disguise
she
argued
that
americans
would
eventually
lose
their
private
health
insurance
as
buttigieg's
plan
like
others
implemented
regulations
like
automatic
enrollment
designed
to
stunt
competition
from
private
companies
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
really
crowd
out
the
private
competitors
by
using
their
regulatory
power
to
make
the
advantage
towards
the
government
plan
schaefer
said
she
added
that
democrats
would
likely
create
a
plan
that
looks
artificially
less
expensive
but
yet
somehow
can
offer
all
the
benefits
that
are
far
more
generous
than
what
the
private
market
is
offering
that
in
itself
already
seems
too
good
to
be
true
because
it
is
buttigieg's
plan
was
just
the
latest
of
democratic
proposals
to
promise
consumer
protection
at
the
expense
of
private
enterprise
his
plan
promised
a
series
of
price
controls
and
regulations
that
it
said
would
prevent
hospitals
and
insurers
from
charging
exorbitant
prices
that
included
an
outright
cap
on
premiums
at
percent
of
income
requiring
in-network
health
care
facilities
to
only
use
in-network
providers
and
blocking
providers
from
charging
more
than
twice
what
medicare
would
for
an
out-of-network
service
fellow
candidate
calls
bernie's
medicare-for-all
plan
a
losing
battle
that
will
set
country
back
years
ryan
young
a
senior
fellow
at
the
competitive
enterprise
institute
told
fox
news
that
consumers
would
continue
facing
high
costs
even
with
reduced
premiums
their
lower
premiums
would
not
reduce
health
care
costs
either
they
would
have
to
be
made
up
for
with
some
mix
of
higher
taxes
increased
debt
lower
health
care
quality
slower
innovation
and
reduced
availability
price
controls
are
not
a
free
lunch
he
said
on
thursday
buttigieg
would
also
intensify
government
monitoring
of
health
care
providers
by
beefing
up
federal
anti-trust
enforcement
and
forcing
insurers
to
report
on
cost
disparities
surrounding
mental
health
care

buttigieg
will
likely
face
criticism
from
progressives
as
his
plan
stops
short
of
endorsing
the
kind
of
large-scale
government
system
that
sanders
and
warren
have
endorsed
like
former
vice
president
joe
biden
buttigieg's
plan
would
build
on
the
existing
marketplaces
set
up
by
the
affordable
care
act
while
rolling
back
president
donald
trump's
attempts
to
dismantle
the
obama-era
legislation
that
policy
famously
earned
him
criticism
from
other
candidates
who
in
criticizing
him
provoked
a
backlash
by
appearing
to
attack
former
president
obama's
administration
