the
justice
department
told
a
judge
friday
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
shouldn't
be
granted
access
to
unreleased
material
from
the
former
special
counsel's
russia
investigation
as
it
weighs
whether
to
move
forward
with
impeachment
proceedings
against
president
trump
the
committee
had
filed
a
petition
in
federal
court
for
lawmakers
to
obtain
the
grand
jury
material
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
for
his
knowledge
of
any
potential
criminal
acts
by
him
or
his
associates
related
to
conspiring
with
russia
the
department
argued
lawmakers
have
come
nowhere
close
to
demonstrating
a
particularized
need
for
the
information
impeachment
warrior

green
complains
resolution
doesn't
cite
trump
for
racism
what
may
come
of
this
investigation
if
anything
remains
unknown
and
unpredictable
the
court
filing
read
a
redacted
version
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
page
report
was
released
to
the
public
in
april
a
less-redacted
version
where
only
grand
jury
information
was
blacked
out
was
then
given
to
certain
lawmakers
including
the
committee's
chairman
and
ranking
member
the
committee
asserted
its
need
of
the
full
unredacted
version
of
mueller's
report
as
well
as
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
filed
a
lawsuit
under
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
in
july
the
justice
department
argued
the
blacked-out
information
in
the
report
comprised
a
tiny
percentage
of
the
document
and
that
the
committee
hadn't
provided
a
sufficient
explanation
as
to
how
the
material
would
help
their
investigation
of
trump
the
doj
also
argued
an
impeachment
proceeding
carried
out
in
congress
wouldn't
be
considered
a
judicial
proceeding
under
law
in
which
case
the
information
could
have
been
disclosed
the
department
went
on
to
argue
that
several
investigations
stemming
from
mueller's
probe
remained
open
thus
there
is
a
continuing
need
for
secrecy
about
grand
jury
proceedings
