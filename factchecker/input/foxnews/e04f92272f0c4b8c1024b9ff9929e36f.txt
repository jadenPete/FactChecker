get
s-
on
all
time
the
sidewalks
outside
of
the
station
are
covered
in
bird
waste
and
feathers
andrade
said
he's
been
trying
to
fix
the
problem
one
of
his
ideas
is
to
ask
the
chicago
transit
authority
cta
to
install
a
hose
line
for
power
washing
when
it
constructs
new
escalators
at
the
stop
china
bans

drones
as
beijing
preps
for
th
anniversary
military
parade
one
cta
rider
derek
barthel
told
wbbm
that
after
the
news
station
reported
on
the
problem
over
the
summer
the
station
was
washed
but
then
nothing
at
all
happened
pigeon
poop
has
been
creating
a
messy
commute
for
chicago
transportation
authority
riders
istock
andrade
said
that
in
he
requested
million
in
the
state
budget
for
the
irving
park
blue
line
this
is
the
mistake
when
i
said
literally
million
for
irving
park
blue
line
he
told
the
news
outlet
the
funds
are
for
the
cta
blue
line
and
so
probably
and
with
the
funds
where
it
came
from
can
only
be
used
for
construction
