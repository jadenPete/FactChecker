a
newly
surfaced
video
clip
from
shows
joe
biden
recounting
a
bizarre
alleged
incident
in
which
he
deftly
avoided
a
razor-and-chain
fight
with
a
gang
leader
named
corn
pop
when
biden
was
serving
as
the
only
white
lifeguard
at
a
predominately
black
delaware
pool
in
the
summer
of
biden's
explanation
of
how
he
made
corn
pop
stand
down
was
making
the
rounds
on
social
media
as
the
former
vice
president
was
seeking
to
burnish
his
credentials
with
black
voters
his
extraordinary
lifeguarding
tale
was
immediately
questioned
by
commentators
with
sway
in
the
black
community
however
some
corroborating
evidence
emerged
later
in
the
day
sunday
indicating
some
version
of
that
tale
really
did
happen
the
former
vice
president
has
long
claimed
that
he
had
applied
to
be
a
lifeguard
at
the
pool
to
better
understand
black
america
and
wrote
in
his
memoir
that
corn
pop
often
tormented
him
at
the
pool
for
example
biden
said
corn
pop
the
purported
leader
of
a
gang
called
the
romans
would
insult
biden's
mother
to
distract
him
so
that
people
could
sneak
into
the
pool
i
learned
a
lot
and
i
learned
that
it
makes
a
difference
biden
said
in
the
video
clip
which
documented
the
ceremony
in
which
the
brown-burton-winchester
park
was
renamed
the
joseph
r.
biden
jr
aquatic
center
the
clip
was
recorded
and
aired
originally
by
witn
in
wilmington
this
was
the
diving
board
area
and
i
was
one
of
the
guards
and
they
weren't
allowed
to
it
was
a
meter
board
and
if
you
fell
off
sideways
you
landed
on
the
damn
er
darn
cement
over
there
biden
said
some
members
of
the
crowd
laughed
apparently
at
biden
correcting
his
language
as
a
small
gathering
of
black
children
surrounding
biden
looked
ahead
seemingly
disinterested
and
corn
pop
was
a
bad
dude
and
he
ran
a
bunch
of
bad
boys
and
back
in
those
days
to
show
how
things
have
changed
one
of
the
things
you
had
to
use
if
you
used
pomade
in
your
hair
you
had
to
wear
a
baby
cap
and
so
he
was
up
on
the
board
and
wouldn't
listen
to
me
i
said
hey
esther
you
off
the
board
or
i'll
come
up
and
drag
you
off
well
he
came
off
and
he
said
i'll
meet
you
outside
biden's
comments
were
a
reference
to
competitive
swimmer-turned
actress
esther
williams
who
died
in
my
car
was
mostly
these
were
all
public
housing
behind
us
biden
continued
my
car
there
was
a
gate
on
here
i
parked
my
car
outside
the
gate
and
he
said
i'll
be
waiting
for
you
he
was
waiting
for
me
with
three
guys
with
straight
razors
not
a
joke
there
was
a
guy
named
bill
wright
the
only
white
guy
and
he
did
all
the
pools
he
was
a
mechanic
and
i
said
what
am
i
gonna
do
and
he
said
come
down
here
in
the
basement
where
all
the
mechanics-
where
all
the
pool
builder
is
you
know
the
chain
there
used
to
be
a
chain
that
went
across
the
deep
end
and
he
cut
off
a
six-foot
length
of
chain
and
folded
it
up
and
he
said
you
walk
out
with
that
chain
and
you
walk
to
the
car
and
say
you
may
cut
me
man
but
i'm
gonna
wrap
this
chain
around
your
head
biden
claims
details
irrelevant
after
getting
caught
telling
false
war
story
biden
continued
i
said
you're
kidding
me
he
said
no
if
you
don't
don't
come
back
and
he
was
right
so
i
walked
out
with
the
chain
and
i
walked
up
to
my
car
and
in
those
days
you
remember
the
straight
razors
you
had
to
bang
em
on
the
curb
gettin
em
rusty
puttin
em
in
the
rain
barrel
gettin
em
rusty
and
i
looked
at
him
but
i
was
smart
then
i
said
first
of
all
i
said
when
i
tell
you
to
get
off
the
board
you
get
off
the
board
and
i'll
kick
you
out
again
but
i
shouldn't
have
called
you
esther
williams
and
i
apologize
for
that
i
apologize
but
i
didn't
know
that
apology
was
gonna
work
he
said
you
apologize
to
me
biden
went
on
i
said
i
apologize
but
not
for
throwing
you
out
but
i
apologize
for
what
i
said
he
said
ok
closed
that
straight
razor
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
again
reaction
to
the
clip
was
a
mixture
of
befuddlement
and
skepticism
what
is
going
on
i'm
really
confused
and
i
feel
like
i'm
losing
my
mind
journalist
yashar
ali
wrote
however
former
delaware
naacp
president
richard
smith
corroborated
biden's
account
saying
the
former
vice
president
stood
his
ground
despite
corn
pop's
aggression
and
contemporaneous
newspaper
reports
uncovered
by
cnn
reporter
daniel
dale
revealed
that
an
individual
nicknamed
corn
pop
did
live
in
wilmington
and
died
in
at
the
age
of
a
former
wilmington
mayor
confirmed
that
the
individual
was
the
same
person
to
whom
biden
was
referring
additionally
a
gang
called
the
romans
did
exist
dale
found
speaking
after
biden
at
the
dedication
rep
lisa
blunt
rochester
d-del
later
referred
to
the
gang
leader
as
pop
corn
and
told
attendees
that
biden's
story
was
special
because
it
showed
the
kind
of
man
that
joe
biden
is
he
wasn't
afraid
to
be
the
only
white
lifeguard
here
rochester
said
he
never
shied
away
and
so
to
me
this
pool
is
really
representative
of
this
man
this
pool
acts
as
an
inspiration
to
us
he
was
basically
saying
stay
woke
before
millenials
were
saying
stay
woke
and
that's
the
situation
we're
in
right
now
and
so
this
pool
is
a
representation
of
you
we
love
you
thank
you
so
much
for
all
of
your
service
but
others
had
their
doubts
they
told
biden
that
corn
pop
carried
a
straight
razor
and
was
gonna
be
waiting
for
him
when
he
got
off
work
wrote
the
root's
michael
harriott
now
you
and
i
both
know
that
if
this
was
true
biden
would've
just
called
the
cops
to
walk
him
to
the
car
harriott
added
anyway
biden
says
instead
he
wrapped
a
foot
metal
chain
around
his
arm
and
wrapped
that
in
a
towel
because
everyone
knows
there
are
ample
black
chains
just
laying
around
the
african-american
community
but
no
police
officers
it's
already
been
demonstrably
proven
biden
will
make
stuff
up
harriott
noted
biden
indeed
earnestly
has
told
inaccurate
stories
in
the
past
a
headline
in
the
washington
post
last
month
for
example
read
simply
as
he
campaigns
for
president
joe
biden
tells
a
moving
but
false
war
story
that
incident
involved
an
inaccurate
claim
by
biden
that
he
had
brushed
aside
security
concerns
to
travel
to
afghanistan
on
a
general's
request
to
pin
a
silver
star
on
an
american
soldier
who
rappelled
into
a
ravine
to
retrieve
a
dead
comrade
biden
gave
his
word
as
a
biden
that
he
was
telling
god's
truth
as
he
explained
that
the
soldier
resisted
biden's
efforts
to
pin
the
silver
star
on
him
except
almost
every
detail
in
the
story
appears
to
be
incorrect
the
post
found
based
on
interviews
with
more
than
a
dozen
u.s.
troops
their
commanders
and
biden
campaign
officials
it
appears
as
though
the
former
vice
president
has
jumbled
elements
of
at
least
three
actual
events
into
one
story
of
bravery
compassion
and
regret
that
never
happened
biden
later
dismissed
concerns
about
his
apparent
fabrications
as
irrelevant
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
judgment
of
whether
or
not
you
send
troops
to
war
the
judgment
of
whether
you
bring
someone
home
the
judgment
of
whether
you
decide
on
a
health
care
policy
biden
said
in
comments
aired
last
month
by
the
npr
politics
podcast
and
iowa
public
radio
the
details
are
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
click

the
fox
news
app
commentators
also
have
doubted
many
of
biden's
other
claims
for
instance
the
washington
free
beacon's
alex
griswold
reacted
with
skepticism
to
a
biden
story
about
how
his
father
in
the
s
had
reacted
to
the
site
of
two
men
kissing
by
telling
his
son
joey
they
love
each
other
it's
simple
oh
sure
i
absolutely
believe
that
joe
biden
saw
two
men
kissing
publicly
in
the
s
and
that
his
irish-catholic
father
reacted
by
approving
of
it
