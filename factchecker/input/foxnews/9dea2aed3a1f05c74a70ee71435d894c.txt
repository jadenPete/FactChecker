uk
gambling
site
has
more
bets
for
hillary
clinton
winning
dem
nomination
than
anyone
actually
running
hillary
clinton
reads
her
emails
for
an
hour
at
art
exhibitreaction
from
conservative
columnist
mark
steyn
on
tucker
carlson
tonight
hillary
clinton
may
say
she
is
not
seeking
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
but
british
bettors
are
apparently
not
convinced
with
one
site
getting
more
wagers
on
her
than
for
any
of
the
declared
candidates
u.k.
bookmaker
ladbrokes
allows
people
to
put
money
on
the
race
and
according
to
matthew
shaddick
head
of
their
political
betting
division
the
former
first
lady
and
secretary
of
state
is
currently
leading
the
pack
when
it
comes
to
the
number
of
bets
people
have
made
mariah
carey
calls
hillary
clinton
president
in
photo
op
we're
baffled
to
be
honest
shaddick
told
newsweek
we've
taken
more
bets
on
her
to
be
the
democratic
candidate
than
any
of
the
other
runners
the
site
currently
has
clinton's
betting
odds
at
to
placing
her
alone
in
seventh
place
as
far
as
best
odds
that
is
ahead
of
most
of
the
people
actually
running
including
sens
cory
booker
d-n
j.
and
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
rep
tulsi
gabbard
d-hawaii
and
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
another
former
first
lady
who
is
not
running
for
president
is
also
getting
better
odds
than
some
of
the
people
in
the
race
michelle
obama
currently
has
odds
of
to
ahead
of
candidates
including
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
author
marianne
williamson
and
billionaire
tom
steyer
who
are
each
at
to
ex-clinton
aide
says
she
would
ankle
dive
to
stop
hillary
from
running
again
ladbrokes
currently
has
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
as
the
front-runner
with
to
odds
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
at
to
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
at
to
and
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
and
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
at
to
of
all
of
them
it's
the
nominee
clinton
that
shaddick
says
would
hurt
his
site
the
most
she
would
be
by
far
the
worst
result
for
us
i
e
the
one
we
would
lose
most
money
on
shaddick
said
hence
her
odds
have
come
in
from
to
click
here
to
get
the
fox
news
app
nevertheless
he
does
not
understand
why
people
are
betting
on
her
i've
seen
some
speculation
about
what
might
happen
if
biden
had
to
drop
out
for
some
reason
perhaps
that
would
leave
a
space
for
her
to
occupy
in
the
field
shaddick
said
doesn't
really
convince
me
as
a
good
reason
though
