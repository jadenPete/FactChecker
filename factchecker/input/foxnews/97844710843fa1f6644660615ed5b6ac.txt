a
federal
judge
in
california
thursday
granted
the
trump
campaign's
request
to
block
a
new
law
that
requires
presidential
and
gubernatorial
candidates
to
release
five
years
of
tax
returns
to
run
in
the
state's
primary
elections
the
law
signed
by
gov
gavin
newsom
a
democrat
in
july
would
have
left
the
sitting
president
off
of
the
ballot
in
california's
march
primary
unless
he
submitted
five
years
worth
of
his
tax
returns
by
a
nov
deadline
the
los
angeles
times
reported
under
sb
trump
would
be
included
on
the
general
election
ballot
in
november
oppoenents
of
the
law
argue
depressed
gop
voter
turnout
in
the
primary
could
discourage
voters
from
showing
up
to
vote
for
the
president
in
the
main
race
trump
files
lawsuit
in
bid
to
protect
personal
corporate
tax
returns
from
release
we
are
encouraged
that
the
federal
court
has
tentatively
concluded
that
a
preliminary
injunction
should
be
granted
we
look
forward
to
the
court's
written
order
trump's
attorney
jay
sukelow
said
in
a
statement
according
to
the
hill
it
remains
our
position
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
states
are
not
permitted
to
add
additional
requirements
for
candidates
for
president
and
that
the
law
violated
citizens

amendment
right
of

u.s.
district
judge
morrison
england
jr
who
was
appointed
by
president
george
w.
bush
said
he
would
issue
a
final
ruling
by
the
end
of
the
month
he
said
he
handed
down
an
initial
order
from
the
bench
to
prevent
the
irreparable
harm
without
temporary
relief
for
trump
and
other
candidates
should
the
law
go
into
effect
according
to
the
times
thursday's
hearing
consolidated
five
separate
lawsuits
filed
against
the
state
in
response
to
sb
but
trump
was
the
most
high-profile
defendant
some
argue
the
law
was
politically
motivated
and
was
conjured
up
by
democrats
who
are
leading
a
widespread
push
to
force
the
president
to
turn
over
his
tax
returns
the
elephant
in
the
room
is
president
trump's
tax
returns
that's
what
this
is
about
england
said
during
the
hearing
in
sacramento
but
it
does
have
implications
that
are
far-reaching
trump's
lawyers
said
sb
would
unfairly
force
the
president
to
give
up
his
right
to
privacy
trump
has
already
complied
with
federal
law
by
submitting
an
annual
report
that
provides
an
overview
of
his
finances

which
was
enacted

to
a
range
of
high-ranking
federal
officials
the
los
angeles
times
reported
lawyers
from
the
state
and
national
republican
parties
also
argued
that
the
u.s.
constitution
not
states
sets
the
qualifications
to
run
for
president
and
that
a
federal
law
requiring
candidates
to
release
financial
information
supersedes
the
state's
power
to
seek
additional
details
i
don't
care
how
you
skin
the
cat
it's
an
unconstitutional
law
harmeet
dhillon
who
represented
the
state
and
national
republican
parties
said
during
the
hearing
lawyers
also
argued
the
law
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
and
could
lead
to
candidates
being
forced
to
release
medical
records
or
college
transcripts
in
order
to
be
able
to
qualify
to
run
for
office
the
state's
attorneys
said
it's
within
california's
power
to
regulate
its
primary
elections
secretary
of
state
alex
padilla
said
the
state
will
consider
whether
or
not
to
appeal
the
ruling
when
the
judge
releases
a
written
decision
by
oct
none
of
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
submitted
five
years
worth
of
their
tax
returns
to
the
state
of
california
to
comply
with
the
new
law

have
released

sift
through
five
years
worth
of
his
own
tax
records

the
times
under
california's
so-called
jungle
primary
system
all
candidates
regardless

vie

elected
office
and

two
vote-getters

on
to
the
general
election
since
it
was
implemented
in
california
in
this
system

often
ensured
a
democrat-on-democrat
general
election
battle
in
all
but
california's
most
conservative
areas
depressed

turnout
in

could
mean
even
fewer
