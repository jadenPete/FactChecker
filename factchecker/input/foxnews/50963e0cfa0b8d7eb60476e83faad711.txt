react
to
the
democratic
debate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
have
kept
up
their
debate
over
health
care
following
their
spat
during
thursday
night's
democratic
debate
with
biden
accusing
sanders
of
effectively
handing
americans
a
pay
cut
and
sanders
accusing
biden
of
distorting
the
socialist's
medicare-for-all
plan
i
do
not
doubt
the
motives
of
either
of
the
two
leaders
on
the
issue
of
medicare-for-all
i
don't
doubt
their
motives
biden
said
in
houston
friday
while
discussing
sanders
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
but
it's
going
to
cost
over
trillion
dollars
a
year
just
to
fund
medicare
trillion
a
year
that
is
twice
the
entire
federal
budget
save
interest
on
the
debt
and
so
how
do
you
do
that
without
raising
taxes
there's
not
enough
taxes
to
cut
eliminate
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
there's
not
enough
out
there
to
get
you
there
he
added
biden
the
frontrunner
has
faced
criticism
from
multiple
candidates
for
wanting
to
build
on
the
affordable
care
act
rather
than
advocating
a
larger
single-payer
program
like
medicare-for-all
biden
mocks
sanders
for
a
socialist
you've
got
a
lot
more
confidence
in
corporate
america
than
i
do
on
friday
the
sanders
campaign
accused
biden
of
dishonest
attacks
and
furthering
the
health
care
industry's
narrative
on
the
issue
it's
disappointing
joe
biden
is
echoing
the
deceptions
and
falsehoods
of
the
health
care
industry
joe
biden
may
love
the
insurance
industry
and
the
outrageously
high
premiums
co-payments
and
out-of-pocket
expenses
they
charge
us
most
americans
don't
a
campaign
statement
read
during
a
campaign
stop
in
nevada
friday
sanders
repeated
his
refrain
that
health
care
is
a
human
right
and
that
medicare-for-all
would
cover
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
country
it
requires
no
premiums
no
deductibles
and
no
out-of-pocket
costs
and
would
expand
medicare
to
include
such
things
as
dental
care
hearing
aids
and
home
health
care
apparently
the
vice
president
thinks
it
is
just
wonderful
for
people
to
be
paying
a
month
just
for
health
care
premiums
he
said
during
the
town
hall
event
in
carson
city
having
deductibles
of
or
or
more
not
a
problem
paying
the
highest
prices
in
the
world
for
prescription
drugs
not
a
problem
well
i
think
those
are
problems
it's
not
a
terribly
radical
idea
because
in
one
form
or
another
it
exists
in
countries
all
over
the
world
including
canada
sanders
said
is
it
free
no
it
is
funded
out
of
the
general
fund
in
a
progressive
manner
later
in
the
event
sanders
listened
as
a
year-old
navy
veteran
with
huntington's
disease
told
the
senator
he
was
planning
to
kill
himself
after
losing
his
health
care
and
racking
up
in
medical
expenses
sanders
laughs
out
loud
at
biden's
rather
humorous
claim
he's
too
trusting
of
corporate
america
sanders
responded
no
you're
not
and
promised
to
meet
with
the
man
privately
after
the
event
according
to
the
las
vegas
journal-review
the
scrap
between
biden
and
sanders
is
a
microcosm
of
a
broader
ongoing
debate
within
the
democratic
party
sanders
a
self-described
democratic
socialist
has
championed
progressive
proposals
and
adopted
a
more
aggressive
anti-corporate
tone
than
biden
has
when
the
two
faced
off
on
thursday
biden
attempted
to
mock
sanders
anti-corporate
image
by
accusing
him
of
trusting
employers
too
much
in
his
medicare
for
all
proposal
biden
argued
that
employers
who
now
pay
a
share
of
workers
premiums
would
pocket
that
money
instead
of
giving
workers
raises
if
the
government
were
to
cover
all
health
care
costs
let
me
tell
you
something
for
a
socialist
you've
got
a
lot
more
confidence
in
corporate
america
than
i
do
biden
said
sanders
later
laughed
that
statement
off
during
an
interview
with
fox

one
of

that
was
biden
by

one
of
us
voted
for
disastrous
trade
agreements
that
were

that
was
biden
one
of
us
voted
for
a

bill
that

that
was

he
said
so
to
suggest
that
bernie
sanders
is
sympathetic
to
the
corporate
elite
i
think
is
rather
humorous
