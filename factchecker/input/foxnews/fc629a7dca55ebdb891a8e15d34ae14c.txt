a

takes
a
big
swipe
at
former

joe

fitness

spotlighting
clips
of
his
recent
gaffes
and
other
verbal
fumbles
coupled
with
copious
clips
of
pundits
questioning
his
readiness
the
web
video
tweeted
tuesday
morning
by
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
and
shared
first
with
fox
news
stitches
together
everything
from
his
recent
debate-stage
musing
about
record
players
to
his
statement
that
poor
kids
are
just
as
talented
as
white
kids
interspersed
with
the
clips
of
the
year-old
biden's
comments
are
those
of
pundits
wondering
about
his
stumbles
shakiness

and
physical
stamina
whether
he's
lost
a
step
and
whether
he's
equipped
for
a
very
grueling
campaign
biden's
age
memory
come
under
attack
at
democratic
presidential
debate
the
former
vice
president's
age
and
mental
acuity
have
been
questioned
ever
since
he
launched
his
presidential
campaign
in
late
april
last
week
the
front-runner
in
the
democratic
nomination
race
faced
repeated
attacks
from
rivals
over
his
memory
former
housing
secretary
julian
castro
who
served
in
the
obama
administration
with
biden
landed
arguably
the
lowest
blow
when
he
swiped
at
biden's
memory
accusing
him
of
contradicting
himself
on
whether
americans
would
have
to
buy
into
his
health
care
plan
watch
the
video
here
you
just
said
two
minutes
ago
they
would
have
to
buy
in
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
asked
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
reference
to
past
senior
moments
by
biden
in
that
case
as
the
biden
campaign
later
noted
castro
was
wrong
biden
did
not
say
during
the
debate
that
individuals
would
have
to
buy
in
instead
he
said
that
individuals
would
automatically
be
enrolled
if
they
lost
their
jobs
but
biden
has
drawn
criticism
for
other
stumbles
and
another
rival
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
backed
castro
after
the
debate
and
raised
further
questions
about
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
banner
for
the
democrats
into
i
think
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
told
cnn
in
an
interview
and
i
think
that
castro
had
really
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
and
has
every
right
to
call
out
a
clip
of
that
booker
interview
appears
in
the
trump
campaign
video
the
jabs
from
some
of
his
mid-
and
lower-tier
rivals
are
raising
concerns
that
biden
if
he
wins
the
nomination
would
be
weakened
for
the
general
election
showdown
against
trump
but
another
rival
for
the
nomination
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
of
texas
bluntly
tweeted
this
past
weekend
who
the
hell
cares
about
joe
biden's
age
biden
is
far
from
the
only
candidate
where
age
is
an
issue
the
president
is
and
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
another
top
tier
democratic
presidential
candidate
is
another
top
democratic
white
house
rival
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
is
but
concerns
about
their
ages
have
been
less
of
a
factor
both
biden
and
sanders
have
repeatedly
said
that
age
is
a
legitimate
concern
in
the
race
for
the
white
house
but
biden's
been
brushing
off
criticism
that
he's
too
old
for
the
oval
office
last
friday
he
told
reporters
he'll
prove
his
fitness
through
the
grinding
process
that
is
the
presidential
campaign
trail
and
he
pledged
to
release
his
medical
records
when
i
get
my
next
physical
before
the
voting
begins
next
february
in
the
iowa
caucuses
this
summer
the
doctor
who
was
named
the
white
house
physician
to
the
then-vice
president
said
biden
was
in
excellent
physical
condition
he
is
more
than
capable
of
handling
the
rigors
of
the
campaign
and
the
office
for
which
he
is
running
said
dr
kevin
o'connor
there
is
no
digital
ad
buy
associated
with
the
latest
video
yet
but
the
trump
campaign
has
not
ruled
one
