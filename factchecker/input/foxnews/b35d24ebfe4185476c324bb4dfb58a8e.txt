according
to
the

agreement

immediately
approve

trade
deal
says
us
moving
past
stupid
years
of
trade
policy
the
usmca
is
a
replacement
for
nafta
that
aims
to
modernize
and
bring
nafta
into
the
st
century
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
the
usmca
does
is
that
it
protects
our
markets
that
we
already
have
in
canada
and
mexico
canada
and
mexico
are
our
two
largest
trading
partners

said
they
hope
usmca
boosts
their
struggling
industry
it
will
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
at
least
we
can
get
a
deal
done
with
our
two
neighboring
countries
ueberrhein
said
noting
that
adding
mexico
will
provide
a
critical
lifeline
that
will
be
huge
for
us
by
opening
up
that
avenue
and
keeping
it
going
democrats
have
voiced
concern
about

the

tends

for
ueberrhein
he's
banking
on
today's
struggles
for
later
success
it
probably
will
happen
sometime
again
