mcraven
made
the
remark
on
wednesday
at
new
america's
special
operations
forces
policy
forum
in
washington
d.c.
i've
said
we
have
to
accept
the
fact
i
think
we
do
that
we're
going
to
be
there
for
a
very
long
time
he
said
military
times
reported
is
it
forever
i
don't
think
anything's
for
forever
but
does
that
mean
that
we
will
lose
more
young
men
and
women
does
that
mean
we're
going
to
spend
more
billions
of
dollars
i
think
it
does

the

also
compared
negotiating
with
the
taliban
to
having
talks
with
the
islamic
state
isis
and
maybe
that's
not
a
good
comparison
but
i
do
believe
that
if
we
negotiate
some
sort
of
settlement
with
the
taliban
and
that
settlement
involves
the
withdrawal
of
all
u.s.
troops
from
afghanistan
that
you
know
it
won't
be
six
months
or
a
year
before
all
of
the
blood
and
treasure
we
have
put
into
afghanistan
will
have
been
reversed
because
the
taliban
will
come
back
in
and
do
what
the
taliban
do
mcraven
said
trump
says
talks
with
taliban
are
dead
after
canceling
secret
camp
david
summit
president
trump
abruptly
canceled
a
secret
peace
summit
at
camp
david
with
the
islamist
group
earlier
this
month
after
a
taliban
attack
killed
an
american
soldier
in
kabul
the
president
said
the
talks
were
dead
u.s.
diplomats
and
the
taliban
were
said
to
have
come
to
a
tentative
interim
peace
agreement
after
several
rounds
of
talks
in
qatar
trump
says
taliban
have
never
been
hit
harder
after
nixing
peace
talks
and
when
you
think
particularly
of
the
young
ladies
and
the
progress
we
have
made
in
afghanistan
with
building
girls
schools
and
bringing
women
into
the
political
process
i
mean
these
are
vastly
important
for
afghanistan
and
the
region
the
retired
seal
said
i'm
afraid
that
clock
will
be
turned
back
very
quickly
if
we
negotiate
some
sort
of
settlement
with
the
taliban
that
really
isn't
to
our
benefit
or
afghanistan's
benefit

the

otherwise

if
we

and
we

necessary
to
keep

solvent
if
you
will
i

that'll
be
