barr
has
received
the

and
will
begin
the
process
of
reviewing
it
according
to
a
source
familiar

the

said
his

has
reviewed
over
one
million
records
and
conducted
over
interviews
including
several
of
witnesses
who
only
recently
agreed
to
be
interviewed
horowitz
and
his
investigators
have
probed
how
the
infamous
anti-trump
dossier
compiled
by
former
british
spy
christopher
steele
was
used
to
secure
the
original
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act

warrant
for
former
trump
aide
carter
page
in

as

as
for

renewals
horowitz's
team
has
questioned
why
the
fbi
considered
steele
a
credible
source
and
why
the
bureau
seemed
to
use

to
bolster
steele's
credibility

player
during

time
frame
former

after
horowitz
faulted
him
in
a
separate
inquiry
over
statements
he
made
during
a
hillary
clinton-related
investigation
the

lacked
candor
when

the
