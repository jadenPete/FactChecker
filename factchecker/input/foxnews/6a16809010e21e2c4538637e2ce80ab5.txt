in
heated
exchange
over
deferred
action
former
ice
director
tom
homan
appeared
before
a
house
subcommittee
wednesday
ready
for
a
fight
and
he
got
one
during
a
hearing
held
by
the
house
oversight
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
subcommittee
homan
insisted
that
democrats
were
pushing
a
false
narrative
that
the
trump
administration
was
ending
deferred
action
a
type
of
deportation
reprieve
for
illegal
immigrants
with
medical
issues
the
hearing
room
erupted
when
rep
debbie
wasserman
schultz
d-fla
challenged
his
account
in
starkly
personal
terms
tom
homan
says
he
warned
flores
agreement
would
lead
to
surge
in
family
units
at
border
i
think
it's
important
to
really
make
sure
that
the
jingoistic
bigoted
testimony
of
mr
homan
is
called
out
as
nearly
completely
untrue
as
being
an
outrage
and
as
a
former
official
directing
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
he
should
know
better
she
said
what
did
i
say
was
inaccurate
homan
shot
back
as
chairman
jamie
raskin
d-md
intervened
to
restore
order
i
just
think
it's
important
that
it's
not
accepted
as
accurate
testimony
she
went
on
to
question
other
witnesses
on
the
panel
but
did
not
ask
anything
of
homan
homan
who
is
a
fox
news
contributor
finally
responded
to
wasserman-schultz
when
rep
jim
jordan
r-ohio
had
his
turn
after
responding
to
one
of
jordan's
questions
homan
turned
his
attention
to
the
florida
democrat
who
used
to
lead
the
democratic
national
committee
if
i
can
respond
to
the
earlier
remark
from
wasserman
schultz
i've
forgotten
more
about
this
issue
than
you'll
ever
know
he
said
so
if
you
say
my
testimony
is
inaccurate
it's
wrong
everything
i
said
here
is
accurate
bottom
line
if
you
want
to
go
toe
to
toe
i'm
here
i'm
here
on
my
own
time
to
speak
to
the
american
people
about
what's
false
and
what's
fact
i'm
happy
to
go
toe
to
toe
with
you
mr
homan
wasserman
schultz
responded
i'm
happy
to
do
that
any
day
then
you
gotta
let
me
respond
to
your
question
rather
than
dropping
a
bomb
and
running
away
homan
fired
back
to
which
wasserman
schultz
said
it
was
my
time
cbp
leader
insists
border
agency
did
not
violate
law
over
migrant
detainee
dna
homan's
defense
of
the
trump
administration
was
that
while
democrats
are
claiming
the
medical
deferred
action
program
is
going
away
the
only
change
is
that
decisions
on
who
gets
deferred
action
are
now
being
made
by
ice
instead
of
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
which
is
not
a
law
enforcement
agency
it
is
not
lawful
to
have
a
deferred
action
program
at
any
federal
agency
he
said
during
his
opening
remarks
he
clarified
that
deferred
action
is
a
form
of
prosecutorial
discretion
that
had
to
be
made
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
even
then
only
by
the
relevant
prosecution
agency
that
has
the
statutory
authority
over
those
laws
he
said
it
was
untrue
that
the
administration
was
getting
rid
of
medical
deferred
action
entirely
it
doesn't
help
to
have
a
mixed
message
that
all
of
a
sudden
deferred
action
is
going
away
he
said
later
on
ice
doesn't
put
their
heart
on
a
shelf
when
they
wear
the
badge
and
gun
and
all
of
a
sudden
don't
care
about
humanity
it's
ridiculous
it's
a
ridiculous
false
narrative
and
i'm
going
to
be
here
till
the
day
i
die
defending
the
men
and
women
of
the
border
patrol
and
ice
who
put
it
on
the
line
defending
this
country
click

to
get
the
fox
news
app
prior
to
the
hearing
homan
appeared
on
fox
news
claiming
that
democrats
were
taking
what
was
happening
out
of
context
to
raise
hatred
against
the
administration
and
that
he
was
going
to
defend
his
former
agency
i'm
not
going
there
to
look
for
a
fight
but
i'm
not
going
to
run
away
from
one
either
he
said
