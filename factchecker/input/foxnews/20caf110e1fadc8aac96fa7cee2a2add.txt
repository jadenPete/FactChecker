the
right

discuss
any
problems
that

was
long
friendly
and
it
touched
on
many
questions
sometimes
requiring
serious
answers

allegations
trump

zelenskiy
are
expected

meet
in
person
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
next
week
the
wall
street
journal
reported
friday
that
trump
had
repeatedly
asked
zelenskiy
to
investigate
hunter
biden
who
had
ties
to
a
natural
gas
firm
that
was
being
investigated
by
a
ukrainian
prosecutor
as
part
of
a
corruption
probe
trump
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
has
suggested
that
joe
biden
the
current
frontrunner
for
the
democratic
nomination
worked
while
he
was
vice
president
to
protect
his
son's
company
from
being
investigated
president
trump
is
interested
his
advisor
giuliani
newspapers
democrats
republicans
are
interested
in
whether
pressure
had
been
put
on
ukraine
prystaiko
said
during
the
same
interview
i
want
to
say
that
we
are
an
independent
state
we
have
our
own
secrets
biden
faces
scrutiny
for
demanding
ouster
of
ukraine
official
probing
firm
that
employed
his
son
biden
on
saturday
denied
he
has
ever
spoken
to
hunter
about
his
business
in
ukraine
and
called
president
trump's
actions
an
overwhelming
abuse
of
power
trump's
doing
this
because
he
knows
i'll
beat
him
like
a
drum
and
he's
using
the
abuse
of
power
and
every
element
of
the
presidency
to
try
to
do
something
to
smear
me
biden
told
reporters
in
iowa
on
saturday
new
details
on
trump-ukraine
call
as
dems
clash
with
white
house
on
complaint
president
trump
earlier
on
saturday
tweeted
about
the
ukraine
witch
hunt
which
he
says
is
a
last-ditch
effort
by
the
fake
news
media
to
protect
biden
now
that
the
democrats
and
the
fake
news
media
have
gone
bust
on
every
other
of
their
witch
hunt
schemes
they
are
trying
to
start
one
just
as
ridiculous
as
the
others
call
it
the
ukraine
witch
hunt
while
at
the
same
time
trying
to
protect
sleepy
joe
biden
trump
said
will
fail
again
the
fake
news
media
didn't
want
to
report
that
joe
biden
demanded
that
the
ukrainian
government
fire
a
prosecutor
who
was
investigating
his
son
or
they
won't
get
a
very
large
amount
of
u.s.
money
the
president
had
said
so
they
fabricate
a
story
about
me
and
a
perfectly
fine
and
routine
conversation
i
had
with
the
new
president
of
the
ukraine
nothing
was
said
that
was
in
any
way
wrong
but
biden's
demand
on
the
other
hand
was
a
complete
and
total
disaster
trump
said
giuliani
also
chimed
in
on
saturday
morning
tweeting
biden's
defense
is
not
i
didn't
do
it
but
no
media
outlet
gives
any
credibility
to
the
story
of
course
they
don't
swamp
media
been
covering
up
biden
family
blatant
trading
on
joe's
offices
for
years
joe
is
part
of
the
protected
class
why
would
they
start
now
trump's
call
with
zelenskiy
is
reportedly
what
sparked
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
a
ranking
house
democrat
says
is
being
purposely
withheld
from
congress
possibly
to
protect
