trump
on
wednesday
had
tweeted
that
he
ordered
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
to
substantially
increase
sanctions
on
iran
on
friday
mnuchin
stood
by
the
president
and
said
that
the
sanctions
mean
that
the
u.s.
has
now
cut
off
all
sources
of
funding
to
iran
this
will
mean
no
more
funds
going
to
the
islamic
revolutionary
guard
corps
or
to
fund
terror
and
this
is
on
top
of
our
oil
sanctions

our

institution
sanctions

the
sanctions
are
the
latest
in

growing
sanctions
regime
on
the
country
designed
to
tighten
the
screws
and
stop
tehran's
sponsorship
of
terrorism
in
the
region
all
they
end
to
do
is
stop
with
the
terror
they've
been
the
number
one
country
worldwide
of
terror
between
sponsoring
terror
and
doing
it
themselves
and
we
can't
have
it
he
said
in

the
trump
administration
pulled

out
of
the

and
has
re-imposed

trump
said
he
wants
to
be
restrained
on
the
question
of

action

would
prefer
that

then
to

but

they
misbehave
they're
