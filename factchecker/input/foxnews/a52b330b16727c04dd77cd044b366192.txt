leland
keyser
a
friend
of
christine
blasey
ford
who
allegedly
was
at
the
party
where
ford
says
brett
kavanaugh
assaulted
her
decades
ago
now
says
the
story
just
didn't
make
any
sense
that
revelation
is
contained
in
a
forthcoming
book
by
new
york
times
reporters
robin
pogrebin
and
kate
kelly
titled
the
education
of
brett
kavanaugh
an
investigation
but
the
times
omitted
any
reference
to
keyser's
comments
in
a
widely
panned
article
this
weekend
by
pogrebin
and
kelly
that
was
adapted
from
the
book
nyt
forced
to
issue
editors
note
adding
information
that
alleged
victim
doesn't
even
remember
supposed
assault
the
times
article
instead
included
an
uncorroborated
allegation
from
a
clinton-linked
lawyer
claiming
kavanaugh
had
sexually
assaulted
a
female
student
without
mentioning
that
the
student
did
not
recall
the
events
in
question
the
times
later
published
a
major
update
to
include
those
details
along
with
an
editors
note
but
not
before
virtually
all
major
democratic
presidential
candidates
had
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
specifically
keyser
challenged
ford's
narrative
that
sometime
in
the
summer
of
kavanaugh
and
his
friend
mark
judge
assaulted
her
at
a
party
also
attended
by
keyser
and
p.j.
smith
i
don't
have
any
confidence
in
the
story
keyser
told
the
reporters
of
ford's
claims
according
to
outlets
that
have
reviewed
advance
copies
of
the
forthcoming
book
those
facts
together
i
don't
recollect
and
it
just
didn't
make
any
sense
keyser
added
ford
has
been
unable
to
identify
exactly
where
or
when
the
alleged
assault
occurred
or
how
she
got
home
after
the
incident
keyser
reportedly
remarked
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
be
the
only
girl
at
a
get-together
with
three
guys
have
her
leave
and
then
not
figure
out
how
she's
getting
home
keyser
told
pogrebin
and
kelly
i
just
really
didn't
have
confidence
in
the
story
christine
blasey
ford
accused
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
of
sexually
assaulting
her
decades
ago
when
they
were
both
teenagers
ap
file
last
year
keyser
speaking
through
her
attorney
said
she
could
not
corroborate
ford's
claims
keyser
told
the
fbi
she
felt
pressured
by
partisan
activists
and
ford's
friends
to
change
her
account
and
later
revised
her
statement
to
indicate
that
she
believed
ford
despite
her
lack
of
memory
of
the
episode
keyser's
initial
statement
was
that
simply
put
ms
keyser
does
not
know
mr
kavanaugh
and
she
has
no
recollection
of
ever
being
at
a
party
or
gathering
where
he
was
present
with
or
without
dr
ford
the
revised
statement
from
keyser's
attorney
read
ms
keyser
does
not
refute
dr
ford's
account
and
she
has
already
told
the
press
that
she
believes
dr
ford's
account
however
the
simple
and
unchangeable
truth
is
that
she
is
unable
to
corroborate
it
because
she
has
no
recollection
of
the
incident
in
question
dems
continue
to
push
for
kavanaugh
impeachment
despite
dud
nyt
bombshell
going
bust
the
times
authors
in
the
book
cast
doubt
on
keyser's
memory
writing
that
keyser's
memory
might
be
affected
by
her
struggles
with
alcohol
and
other
substances
keyser
though
also
informed
the
reporters
of
an
apparent
smear
campaign
directed
at
her
in
an
effort
to
get
her
to
change
her
story
ford
in
her
explosive
testimony
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
last
year
indicated
that
it
wasn't
surprising
keyser
wouldn't
remember
the
episode
she
didn't
know
about
the
event
she
was
downstairs
during
the
event
and
i
did
not
share
it
with
her
ford
said
ford
added
leland
has
significant
health
challenges
and
i'm
happy
that
she's
focusing
on
herself
and
getting
the
health
treatment
that
she
needs
and
she
let
me
know
that
she
needed
her
lawyer
to
take
care
of
this
for
her
and
she
texted
me
right
afterward
with
an
apology
and
good
wishes
and
et
cetera
rather
than
mention
keyser's
latest
remarks
the
times
article
instead
focused
on
a
new
accuser
mentioned
in
the
book
who
was
allegedly
sexually
assaulted
by
kavanaugh
but
the
times
article
omitted
key
details
from
the
book
including
that
the
accuser
herself
had
no
recollection
of
the
event
the
times
later
published
an
editors
note
adding
the
information
but
not
before
virtually
all
democratic
presidential
candidates

kavanaugh's
impeachment
throughout
the
day
on
sunday
kamala
harris
elizabeth
warren
beto
o'rourke
cory
booker
and
julian
castro
among
others
declared
that
kavanaugh
must
be
removed
from
office
citing
the
allegation
the
times
update
also
stated
for
the
first
time
that
the
alleged
victim
refused
to
be
interviewed
and
has
made
no
other
comment
about
the
episode
the
only
firsthand
account
concerning
the
supposed
attack
in
the
original
piece
which
was
published
on
saturday
came
from
a
clinton-connected
lawyer
who
claimed
to
have
witnessed
it
the
lawyer
max
stier
did
not
actually
provide
his
account
directly
the
times
acknowledged
that
two
officials
who
have
communicated
with
mr
stier
had
relayed
his
supposed
version
of
events
the
times
did
not
mention
stier's
work
as
a
clinton
defense
attorney
or
stier's
legal
battles
with
kavanaugh
during
the
whitewater
investigation
and
simply
called
him
a
respected
thought
leader
the
times
went
on
to
note
in
the
article
that
it
had
corroborated
the
story
with
two
officials
who
have
communicated
with
mr
stier
but
the
article
apparently
meant
only
that
the
times
had
corroborated
that
stier
made
his
claim
to
the
fbi
no
firsthand
corroboration
of
the
alleged
episode
was
apparently
obtained
the
times
revision
stated
editors
note
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
which
was
adapted
from
a
forthcoming
book
did
not
include
one
element
of
the
book's
account
regarding
an
assertion
by
a
yale
classmate
that
friends
of
brett
kavanaugh
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
the
book
reports
that
the
female
student
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
say
that
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
that
information
has
been
added
to
the
article
the
times
update
came
only
after
the
federalist's
mollie
hemingway
who
reviewed
an
advance
copy
of
the
book
first
flagged
the
article's
omission
on
twitter
prompting
other
commentators
to
press
the
issue
the
times
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
email
from
fox

seeking
comment
but
commentators
made
clear
they
felt
the

wasn't
sufficient

unforgivable
oversight

wrote
the
washington

jerry
dunleavy
crazy
how
the
one
element
that
wasn't
included
in
the
original
article
was
the
part
where
the
alleged
victim's
friends
said
she
doesn't
remember
it
happening

on

acknowledged
