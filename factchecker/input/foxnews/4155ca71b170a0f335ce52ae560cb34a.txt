america's
increasingly
polarized
political
discourse
including
on
college
campuses
threatens
the
future
of
democracy
michael
bloomberg
argues
in
a
recent
editorial
writing
on
the
bloomberg
news
site
the
year-old
billionaire
former
mayor
of
new
york
city
observes
that
americans
are
becoming
too
unwilling
to
engage
with
people
whose
ideas
differ
from
their
own
as
exemplified
by
supporters
and
detractors
of
president
trump
without
engagement
bloomberg
writes
liberal
democracy
can't
survive
texas
students
react
to
doxxing
threats
against
conservatives
on
campus
he
adds
that
americans
used
to
move
forward
productively
after
elections
regardless
of
which
side
won
but
now
seem
paralyzed
by
absolutism
and
intolerance
to
put
it
simply
bloomberg
writes
healthy
democracy
is
about
living
with
disagreement
not
eliminating
it
without
engagement
liberal
democracy
can't
survive
michael
bloomberg
writes
in
a
recent
editorial
associated
press
he
points
to
college
campuses
as
a
prime
example
citing
the
experience
of
steven
gerrard
a
professor
at
williams
college
in
massachusetts
students
declared
gerrard
an
enemy
of
the
people
after
he
advocated
for
williams
to
join
other
schools
in
signing
on
to
the
chicago
statement
published
by
the
committee
on
freedom
of
expression
at
the
university
of
chicago
which
calls
for
free
speech
to
be
central
to
college
and
university
environments
the
students
distributed
a
letter
in
which
they
called
free
speech
a
term
that
has
been
co-opted
by
right-wing
and
liberal
parties
as
a
discursive
cover
for
racism
xenophobia
sexism
anti-semitism
homophobia
transphobia
ableism
and
classism
according
to
bloomberg
this
view
suggests
that
universities
must
suppress
the
very
act
of
reasoning
incredibly

he
notes
that
fewer
than
of
more
than
institutions
across
the
u.s.
have
adopted
or
endorsed
the
chicago
statement
and
asserts
that
the
lack
of
support
has
helped
promote
intolerance
in
the
culture
in
the
end
bloomberg
writes
a
democracy
can't
survive
if
its
people
are
unwilling
to
discuss
areas
of
contention
or
extend
political
bitterness
into
business
boycotts
and
other
demonstrations
of
intolerance
restoring
the
ability
to
disagree
without
becoming
mortal
enemies
he
writes
is
a
new
and
urgent
civic
imperative
