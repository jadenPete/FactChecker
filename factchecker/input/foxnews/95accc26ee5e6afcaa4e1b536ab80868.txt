working

last

did
not
investigate
and
mr
stier
has
declined
to
discuss
it
publicly
the
times
revision
acknowledged
the
original
article
left
out
a
key
detail
editors
note
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
which
was
adapted
from
a
forthcoming
book
did
not
include
one
element
of
the
book's
account
regarding
an
assertion
by
a
yale
classmate
that
friends
of
brett
kavanaugh
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
the

reports
that
the
female
student
declined
to
be

and
friends
say
that
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
that
information
has
been
added
to
the
article
by
this

however
numerous

update
presidential
candidate
tom
steyer
joined
the
chorus
monday
morning
saying
in

the
only
way
to
get
the

is
to
launch
an
impeachment
process
for
justice
kavanaugh
i
support
starting
that
process
immediately
the
update

report
came
only

first
flagged
the

the
issue
the

went
on
to
call
those
behind
the
story
horrible
people
and
claimed
they
were
trying
to
influence
kavanaugh's
judicial
opinions
and
should
be
sued

you
believe
what
these
horrible
people
will
do
or
say
trump
