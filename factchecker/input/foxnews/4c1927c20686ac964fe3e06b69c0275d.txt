gives
his
take
on
the
latest
sexual
assault
allegation
against
a
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
the
new
york
times
suddenly
made
a
major
revision
to
a
supposed
bombshell
piece
late
sunday
concerning
a
resurfaced
allegation
of
sexual
assault
by
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
hours
after
virtually
all
democratic
presidential
candidates
had
cited
the
original
article
as
a
reason
to
impeach
kavanaugh
the
update
included
the
significant
detail
that
several
friends
of
the
alleged
victim
harmon
joyce
said
she
did
not
recall
the
purported
sexual
assault
in
question
at
all
the
times
also
stated
for
the
first
time
that
the
alleged
victim
refused
to
be
interviewed
and
has
made
no
other
comment
about
the
episode
the
only
firsthand
account
concerning
the
supposed
attack
in
the
original
piece
which
was
published
on
saturday
came
from
a
clinton-connected
lawyer
who
claimed
to
have
witnessed
it
the
lawyer
max
stier
did
not
actually
provide
his
account
directly
the
times
acknowledged
that
two
officials
who
have
communicated
with
mr
stier
had
relayed
his
supposed
version
of
events
the
times
revision
says
editors
note
an
earlier
version
of
this
article
which
was
adapted
from
a
forthcoming
book
did
not
include
one
element
of
the
book's
account
regarding
an
assertion
by
a
yale
classmate
that
friends
of
brett
kavanaugh
pushed
his
penis
into
the
hand
of
a
female
student
at
a
drunken
dorm
party
the
book
reports
that
the
female
student
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
say
that
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
that
information
has
been
added
to
the
article
even
after
the
revision
the
times
story
still
does
not
mention
a
separate
revelation
in
the
book
that
leland
keyser
the
friend
of
christine
blasey
ford
who
was
allegedly
at
the
party
where
kavanaugh
supposedly
assaulted
her
had
specifically
rejected
ford's
claims
previously
through
her
attorney
keyser
had
said
only
that
she
was
unable
to
corroborate
it
because
she
has
no
recollection
of
the
incident
in
question
i
don't
have
any
confidence
in
the
story
keyser
told
the
reporters
according
to
the
book
those
facts
together
i
don't
recollect
and
it
just
didn't
make
any
sense
the
times
update
came
only
after
the
federalist's
mollie
hemingway
who
reviewed
an
advance
copy
of
the
book
first
flagged
the
article's
omission
on
twitter
prompting
other
commentators
to
press
the
issue
the
times
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
email
from

seeking
comment
the
paper's
editors
note
meanwhile
did
little
to
stem
a
torrent

how
the

element
that
wasn't

in

not
kavanaugh
himself
surely
even

modern
liberal
yalie
who's
been

one
of

said
the
senate
judiciary
committee
should
begin
an

inquiry
to
determine
whether

lied
to

impeaching
kavanaugh
would
require
a
majority
vote
in
the
democratic-controlled
house
and
a
highly
unlikely
two-thirds
vote
in
the
gop-majority

to
the
american
people
he
was
put
on

through

his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
he
must
be
impeached
during
the
hearings
harris
strongly
implied
that
she
knew
kavanaugh
had
improperly
discussed
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
then-ongoing
probe
with
a
trump-connected
lawyer
harris
provided
no
evidence
for
the
bombshell
insinuation
which
went
viral
on
social

and
sent

these

shot
back

the

willingness
to
seize
on
completely
uncorroborated

unsubstantiated

piece
also
stated
that
well
before

became
a
federal
judge
at
least
seven
people
had
heard
about
how
he
allegedly
exposed
himself
to
deborah
ramirez
at
a
party
ramirez
had
called
classmates
at
yale
seeking
corroboration
for
her
story
and
even
told
some
of
her
classmates
that
she
could
not
remember
the
culprit
in
the
alleged
episode
before
changing
her
mind
and
publicly
blaming
kavanaugh
after
six
days
of
carefully
assessing
her
memories
and
consulting
with
her
attorney

reported
last

additionally
the

reached
out

to
corroborate

to
be
a
hardline
conservative
often
sided
with
liberal
justices
during

court's
last

the

meanwhile
accused
the

of
trying

he
also
went
on
to
say
that
kavanaugh
should
go
on
the
offensive
and
take
on
the

for
false
statements
brett
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the

department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the

being
told
about
him
are
unbelievable
false
accusations
without
recrimination
when
does
it
stop
they
are
trying
to
influence
his
opinions
can't
let
that
happen
he
tweeted
grassley
sent
several
criminal
referrals
to
the
justice
department
related
to
alleged
lies
submitted
to
senate
investigators
during
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
which
could
be
what
the
president
meant
when
he
wrote
sunday
that
the

one

regarding
a

and
her

went
public
to
say
she
was
known
for
exaggerating
everything
swetnick
and
ramirez
were
just
two
of
several
women
who
had
accused
kavanaugh
of
sexual
misconduct
during

christine

ford
notably
testified
that
kavanaugh
attempted
to
sexually
assault
her
at
a
party
when
they
were
teens

dubiously
asserted
that
the
memory
was
indelible
in

could
corroborate
her
ever-changing
story

of
how

ford's
attorney
debra
katz
was
quoted
in
a

as
saying
that
ford
was
motivated
to
come
forward
in

by
a
desire
to
tag
kavanaugh's
reputation
with
an
asterisk
before
he
could
start
ruling
on
abortion-related
cases
in
the
aftermath
of
these

i
believe
that
christine's
testimony
brought
about
more
good
than
the
harm
misogynist
republicans
caused
by
allowing
kavanaugh
on
the

katz
said
he
will
always
have
an
asterisk
next
