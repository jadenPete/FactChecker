descends
into
yelling
when
gaetz
confronts
sharpton
over
past
comments
a
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
on
law
enforcement
on
thursday
morphed
into
a
heated
confrontation
between
gop
rep
matt
gaetz
and
msnbc's
al
sharpton
when
the
florida
lawmaker
challenged
the
activist
and
weekend
host
over
past
inflammatory
comments
at
the
hearing
on
policing
practices
gaetz
cited
a
resolution
from
former
congressman
and
fellow
msnbc
host
joe
scarborough
condemning
sharpton
as
racist
and
anti-semitic
before
rattling
off
a
laundry
list
of
past
quotes
from
sharpton
and
asking
whether
they
were
accurate
have
you
ever
referred
to
members
of
the
jewish
faith
as
white
interlopers
or
diamond
merchants
gaetz
asked
trump
slams
al
sharpton
a
onetime
pal
with
an
inflammatory
past
after
a
few
moments
of
the
two
speaking
over
each
other
gaetz
continued
have
you
ever
referred
to
african-americans
who
disagree
with
you
as
cocktail-sip
negroes
i
have
sharpton
said
the
congressman
later
asked
sharpton
have
you
ever
said
if
the
jews
want
to
get
it
on
they
can
pin
their
yarmulkes
back
and
come
over
to
my
house
rep
matt
gaetz
trump

sharpton
said
that
comment
was
directed
at
one
specific
individual
who
threatened
him
in
not
all
jews
as
the
testy
exchange
continued
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
struggled
to
keep
the
hearing
moving
with
gaetz
and
sharpton
clashing
democratic
members
asked
whether
nadler
could
shut
down
gaetz's
off-topic
line
of
questioning
nadler
called
gaetz's
questioning
obnoxious
but
told
committee
dems
that
the
hard-charging
congressman
had
significant
latitude
under
the
rules
gaetz
objected
to
nadler's
use
of
the
word
obnoxious
before
defending
his
line
of
questioning
as
relevant
to
the
hearing
reverend
sharpton
has
come
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
as
a
purported
expert
on
policing
gaetz
said
yet
his
bigoted
statements
undermine
the
bipartisan
work
we
should
be
doing
to
ensure
that
all
citizens
are
able
to
come
together
and
have
safe
communities

pro-gun

to
give
up
security
details
the
congressman
made
clear
he
thought
sharpton's
past
comments
disqualified
him
from
commenting
on
racism
and
policing
when
you
call
greek
h-
s
when
you
talk
about
white
crackers
these
are
bigoted
statements
gaetz
said
democratic
members
including
rep
hank
johnson
d-ga
condemned
gaetz's
behavior
saying
that
it
was
off-topic
and
damaging
to
the
credibility
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
this
is
taking
our
process
down
to
a
level
that
we
should
never
allow
it
to
descend
to
johnson
said
i'm
objecting
to
us
wallowing
in
the
mud
with
these
comments
after
gaetz's
time
expired
sharpton
launched
one
last
tongue-in-cheek
barb
at
the
congressman
before
answering
further
questions
i
thank
the
gentleman
from
florida
for
letting
me
straighten
out
the
distortion
and
lies
on
the
record
that
i've
been
misquoted
sharpton
said
he's
done
a
great
service
for
my
reputation
the
tense
tone
for
the
hearing
was
set
during
witness
opening
statements
when
the
president
of
the
center
for
policing
equity
dr
phillip
adiba
goff
skipped
part
of
his
prepared
statement
to
go
after
the
testimony
of
the
manhattan
institute's
heather
mac
donald
who
spoke
immediately
before
him

she
cited
a
poll
saying
black
americans
favored
broken
windows
policing
and
cited
research
that
black
americans
are
eight
times
more
likely
to
commit
homicide
than
whites
and
hispanics
combined
she
also
referenced
a
study
that
said
black
civilians
were
shot
by
police
less
often
compared
with
whites
than
their
rates
of
violent
crime
would
predict
my
love
of
country
and
my
respect
for
this
body
and
mostly
my
vocation
as
a
scientist
will
not
allow
me
to
move
to
my
prepared
remarks
just
yet
goff
said
in
response
i
feel
i
must
at
least
correct
the
record
the
hearing
also
included
testimony
from
other
activists
including
former
tennis
professional
james
blake
who
has
advocated
against
police
brutality
after
his
arrest
by
a
