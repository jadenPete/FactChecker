neil
gorsuch
labels
himself
an
originalist
i
don't
do
politics
i
stick
to
my
lane
i'm
a
judge
gorsuch
explained
in
an
exclusive
sit-down
interview
gorsuch
told
america's
newsroom
host
sandra
smith
that
he
believes
in
the
words
of
the
constitution
honor
those
words
don't
make
stuff
up
and
don't
take
things
away
he
told
smith
the
justice
from
colorado
was
appointed
after
a
confirmation
process
in
march
of
he
had
previously
clerked
with
multiple
justices
justice
anthony
kennedy
and
justice
byron
white
as
well
as
judge
david
b.
sentelle
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
shortly
after
that
another
trump-nominated
justice
brett
kavanaugh
a
man
gorsuch
became
well
acquainted
with
over
the
past
years
was
confirmed
in
october
of
but
that
came
only
after
a
series
of
extremely
rocky
public
confirmation
hearings
and
allegations
of
sexual
harassment
i've
known
brett
for
years
probably
gorsuch
said
and
i
think
very
highly
of
him
as
a
person
and
as
a
colleague
and
it's
been
a
delight
to
have
him
here
additionally
gorsuch
shed
some
light
on
the
relationships
between
the
supreme
court
justices
he
said
his
colleagues
are
very
special
strong
independent
kind
people
this
is
a
very
small
institution
there
are
nine
of
us
you're
asking
about
our
collegiality
this
court
and
like
every
court
i've
been
associated
with
it's
a
wonderful
place
to
work
we
eat
lunch
together
we
eat
dinner
at
one
another's
homes
we
play
practical
jokes
on
one
another
once
in
a
while
and
we
shake
hands
every
time
we
gather
and
that's
a
tradition
that's
gone
on
for
years
maybe
not
much
has
changed
in
those
years
according
to
gorsuch
he
says
that
the
united
states
court
system
remains
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
telling
smith
that
those
who
believe
judges
skew
a
certain
way
are
setting
themselves
up
for
disappointment
and
then
they
get
very
confused
when
it
doesn't
break
down
that
way
all
the
time
he
laughed
there
are
million
cases
filed
in
the
united
states
every
year
we're
a
pretty
litigious
bunch
in
the
federal
system
about
percent
of
those
cases
are
resolved
by
a
trial
judge
or
a
jury
at
the
trial
level
and
never
even
appealed
gorsuch
continued
now
the
losing
party
probably
thinks
the
judge
was
wrong
but
they
accept
it
as
reasonably
just
and
fair
only
five
percent
of
cases
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
my
old
court
sit
in
panels
of
three
very
diverse
group
of
people
from
every
walk
of
life
we
would
agree
unanimously
in
our
cases
percent
of
the
time
out
of
those
million
cases
how
many
get
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
about
a
year
that's
it
he
said
try
to
get
nine
people
to
agree
on
where
to
go
to
lunch
we
agree
on
the
cases
our
lower
court
colleagues
have
disagreed
on
we
agree
unanimously
percent
of
the
time
and
that
number
has
been
more
or
less
the
same
since
the
second
world
war
nothing's
changed
gorsuch
maintained
that
decision
cases
were
equally
as
just
on
those
cases
there
were
different
combinations
of
justices
this
last
term
on
those
cases
now
they
don't
report
those
things
but
those
are
the
facts
he
also
said
that
during
the
confirmation
process
he
had
come
to
the
realization
that
our
country
may
be
losing
sight
of
things
like
the
separation
of
powers
and
civic
understanding
we
the
people
are
the
first
three
words
of
the
constitution
we're
supposed
to
govern
ourselves
but
how
can
we
do
that
if
we
don't
know
how
our
government
works
he
asked
gorsuch
said
that
what
makes
america
strong
is
the
raucous
nature
of
a
republic
but
that
for
it
to
work
we
also
have
to
respect
one
another
and
listen
as
well
as
talk
and
tolerate
as
well
as
demand
tolerance
of
our
point
of
view
he
urged
that
when
americans
disagree
they
disagree
because
they
both
love
the
country
he
continued
our
job
isn't
to
do
what
we
want
what
we
like
it's
to
make
sure
that
the
law
that's
enacted
by
the
people's
representatives
is
applied
fairly
and
equally
to
everyone
it's
an
honor
and
i'm
humbled
for
the
opportunity
to
serve
the
american
people
he
concluded
his
new
book
a
republic
if
you
can
keep
it
is
out
now
