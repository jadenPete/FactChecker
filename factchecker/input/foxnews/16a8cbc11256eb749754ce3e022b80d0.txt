inquiry
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
lashed
out
at
reporters
on
thursday
when
they
repeatedly
asked
her
about
her
current
stance
on
impeaching
the
president
while
party
tensions
over
the
process
mount
impeachment
is
a
very
divisive
measure
but
if
we
have
to
go
there
we
have
to
go
there
and
we
can't
go
there
unless
we
have
the
facts
and
we'll
follow
the
facts
and
follow
the
obstruction
the
president
is
making
and
make
a
decision
when
we're
ready
a
visibly
frustrated
pelosi
said
that's
the
only
question
that's
all
i'm
going
to
say
about
this
subject
and
there's
nothing
different
from
one
day
to
the
next
she
added
house
dems
move
on
trump
impeachment
as
republicans
mock
giant
instagram
filter
hiding
disarray
when
reporters
continued
to
press
the
issue
pelosi
cut
them
off
saying
curtly
i'm
not
answering
any
more
questions
on
this
subject
she
did
however
note
that
people
she
speaks
to
outside
washington
are
telling
her
to
be
careful
on
the
question
of
impeachment
before
leaving
the
room
she
scolded
the
media
for
not
focusing
more
on
senate
inaction
on
gun
control
why
is
it
you
are
hung
up
on
a
word
over
here
when
lives
are
at
stake
over
there
she
asked
pelosi
was
speaking
moments
after
democrats
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
voted
to
define
the
rules
for
future
committee
impeachment
hearings
amid
widespread
confusion
in
the
run-up
democratic
leadership
has
given
muddled
statements
on
the
status
of
the

is
engaged
in
an
investigation

d-md
hoyer
later
released
a
statement
saying
that
he
had
misunderstood
the
question
and
that
he
supports
nadler
pelosi
who
has
been
a
more
skeptical
voice
regarding
possible
impeachment
also
said
thursday
that
if
trump
has
any
exculpatory
evidence
he
should
send
it
along

you
appear
that
something's
happening
that's
not
the
difference
between

and
what
we're
doing
today
is
a
world
apart
