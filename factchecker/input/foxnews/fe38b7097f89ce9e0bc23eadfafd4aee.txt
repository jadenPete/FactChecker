whistleblower
complaint
reportedly
on
trump
promise
to
foreign
leader
touches
off
dc
firestorm
trump's
attorney
rudy
giuliani
seemed
to
acknowledge
some
effort
to
pressure
ukraine
to
investigate
potential
corruption
related
to
the
biden
family
though
he
gave
conflicting
answers
on
the
matter
in
a
cnn
interview
overnight
it
remains
unclear
what
the
supposed
promise
from
trump
entailed
the
president
however
maintained
he
said
nothing
improper
tearing
into
those
pushing
the
allegations
friday
speaking
to
reporters
in
the
oval
office
alongside
visiting
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
the
president
blasted
the
ridiculous
story
blaming
a
partisan
whistleblower
and
calling
it
just
another
political
hack
job
i
don't
know
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
trump
said
he
wouldn't
say
what
was
discussed
in
the
call
but
said
someone
should
look
into
biden
family
connections
to
ukraine
he
also
argued
the
press
has
had
a
bad
week
insisting
he
has
prevailed
in
controversies
reported
by
the
media
i
guess
i'm
about
and
and
i'll
keep
it
that
way
the
president
said
afterward
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
d-calif
and
other
democratic
committee
leaders
issued
a
statement
demanding
the
administration
hand
over
the
complaint
president
trump
just
went
on
national
television
from
the
oval
office
and
personally
attacked
an
intelligence
community
whistleblower
who
reported
an
urgent
matter
involving
serious
or
flagrant
misconduct
they
said
adding
that
the
brazen
effort
to
intimidate
this
whistleblower
risks
a
chilling
effect
on
future
whistleblowers
earlier
friday
trump
sounded
off
on
twitter
accusing
schiff
of
joining
with
the
media
to
go
after
him
once
again
the
radical
left
democrats
and
their
fake
news
media
partners
headed
up
again
by
little
adam
schiff
and
batting
zero
for
against
me
are
at
it
again
the
president
tweeted
friday
they
think
i
may
have
had
a
dicey
conversation
with
a
certain
foreign
leader
based
on
a
highly
partisan
whistleblowers
statement
he
added
strange
that
with
so
many
other
people
hearing
or
knowing
of
the
perfectly
fine
and
respectful
conversation
that
they
would
not
have
also
come
forward
do
you
know
the
reason
why
they
did
not
because
there
was
nothing
said
wrong
it
was
pitch
perfect
for
his
part
schiff
told
reporters
friday
that
the
whistleblower
claim
deserves
a
thorough
investigation
come
hell
or
high
water
that's
what
we're
going
to
do
he
said
meanwhile
allies
of
the
president
took
to
the
airwaves
to
downplay
the
story
this
is
a
clear
example
of
someone
from
the
deep
state
from
the
intelligence
community
former
acting
attorney
general
matthew
whitaker
said
on
fox
news
the
story
with
martha
maccallum
it
was
completely
overblown
it
will
be
a
big
nothing
burger
fueling
intrigue
giuliani
has
raised
questions
about
the
activities
of
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
son
hunter
who
worked
for
a
ukrainian
gas
company
joe
biden
now
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
has
faced
scrutiny
for
months
over
his
past
role
pressuring
the
country
to
fire
its
top
prosecutor
while
he
was
leading
a
corruption
investigation
into
that
company
during
an
interview
thursday
on
cnn
giuliani
was
asked
whether
he
had
asked
ukraine
to
look
into
biden
giuliani
initially
said
no
actually
i
didn't
but
seconds
later
he
said
of
course
i
did
he
explained
that
he
sought
for
the
government
to
look
into
how
the
case
was
dismissed
later
giuliani
tweeted
a
president
telling
a
pres-elect
of
a
well
known
corrupt
country
he
better
investigate
corruption
that
affects
us
is

matthew
whitaker
calls
reported
whistleblower
complaint
a
clear
example
of
someone
from
the
deep
state
the
whistleblower
complaint
has
triggered
a
major
showdown
with
congress
after
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
would
not
share
details
of
it
with
lawmakers
the
inspector
general
for
the
intelligence
community
received
the
complaint
and
according
to
correspondence
with
schiff
considered
the
allegations
credible
and
dealing
with
an
urgent
concern
but
the
watchdog
reported
to
the
committee
that
his
office
is
at
an
impasse
with
the
director
of
national
intelligence
over
the
disclosure
inspector
general
michael
atkinson
wrote
that
the
dni
after
consulting
with
the
department
of
justice
determined
the
complaint
does
not
have
to
be
shared
with
the
intelligence
committees
under
law
he
wrote
that
he
will
abide
by
that
determination
but
disagrees
with
it
after
a
closed-door
hearing
thursday
with
atkinson
schiff
voiced
concerns
about
not
having
access
to
the
information
warning
congress
could
use
legal
action
or
budgetary
powers
as
leverage
what's
at
stake
here
goes
well
beyond
this
complaint
and
this
president
he
said
schiff
had
subpoenaed
maguire
saying
he
was
withholding
a
whistleblower
complaint
from
congress
and
questioning
whether
he
had
been
directed
to
do
so
by
the
white
house
or
the

in

letter
tuesday
the
general
counsel
for
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
jason
klitenic
wrote
that
the
agency
is
protecting
the
whistleblower
and
argued
the
allegation
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
urgent
concern
he
said
the
complaint
concerned
conduct
from
someone
outside
the
intelligence
community
and
did
not
relate
to
intelligence
activity
under
the
dni's
supervision
schiff
said
last
week
that
maguire
is
required
to
share
the
complaint
with
congress
and
said
the
attempt
to
hold
it
back
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct
following
thursday's

maguire
is
still

to
testify
