house
judiciary
democrats
on
thursday
took
a
big
step
in
their
trump
impeachment
push
as
they
set
the
ground
rules
for
a
formal
committee
inquiry
but
republicans
laughed
it
off
as
a
giant
instagram
filter
to
hide
how
divided
democrats
truly
are
on
the
question
the
committee
voted
to
define
the
rules
for
future
committee
impeachment
hearings
the
committee
is
not
writing
articles
of
impeachment
and
nothing
is
going
to
the
floor
of
the
house
right
now
but
the
session
still
holds
political
consequences
for
both
sides
of
the
aisle
impeachment
fever
rises
as
dems
face
summer-recess
pressure
to
go
after
trump
the
resolution
before
us
represents
the
necessary
next
step
in
our
investigation
of
corruption
obstruction
and
abuse
of
power
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-n
y.
said
in
his
opening
statement
the
vote
allows
members
to
show
the
impeachment-eager
base
they
are
moving
forward
but
the
push
has
also
rattled
some
democrats
from
more
moderate
districts
it's
sucking
the
air
out
of
all
of
the
good
stuff
we're
doing
rep
donna
shalala
d-fla
who
flipped
her
seat
from
republican
control
last
year
said
wednesday
but
nadler
has
sought
to
clear
the
air
on
what
his
committee
is
actually
doing
amid
widespread
confusion
nadler
said
thursday
the
panel
is
engaged
in
an
investigation
as
to
whether
to
launch
an
impeachment
investigation
into
president
trump
nadler
had
previously
said
house
democrats
are
pursuing
an
impeachment
inquiry
a
remark
subsequently
contradicted
by
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
hoyer
later
released
a
statement
saying
he
had
misunderstood
the
question
and
that
he
supports
nadler
in
his
opening
statement
thursday
nadler
said
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
nadler
says
the
resolution
at
issue
allows
him
to
determine
if
various
hearings
are
part
of
any
impeachment
probe
allows
counsel
to
question
witnesses
at
those
hearings
gives
the
committee
access
to
documents
in
executive
sessions
and
gives
the
president
due
process
he
said
that
formalizing
the
inquest
enables
us
to
move
more
effectively
and
quickly
broadly
speaking
it
represents
another
step
by
democrats
toward
impeachment
proceedings
in
the
wake
of
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
while
mueller's
team
drew
a
blank
on
evidence
that
trump's
campaign
engaged
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
with
russia
in
the
initial
basis
for
the
probe
democrats
then
turned
to
other
issues
including
trump's
finances
and
alleged
obstruction
of
justice
but
republicans
brushed
off
the
meeting
thursday
arguing
that
democrats
are
all
bark
but
no
bite
on
the
subject
of
impeachment
making
a
fuss
about
a
simple
procedure
issue
rep
doug
collins
r-ga
compared
the
democrats
move
thursday
to
a
giant
instagram
filter
to
make
you
appear
that
something's
happening
that's
not
the
difference
between
formal
impeachment
proceedings
and
what
we're
doing
today
is
a
world
apart
no
matter
what
the
chairman
just
said
he
said
trump
probes
rocket
to
front
of
dem
agenda
as
president
dismisses
new
ethics
complaint
later
on
he
got
his
social
media
brands
mixed
up
and
when
corrected
yelled
instagram
snapchat
twitter
it
doesn't
matter
we're
not
in
an
impeachment
inquiry
collins
claimed
that
the
rules
could
have
been
handled
five
minutes
before
an
actual
hearing
and
said
it
showed
how
out
of
step
house
democrats
are
with
their
colleagues
and
the
public
all
along
they
thought
people
were
coming
along
with
them
and
that
the
public
was
happy
with
this
and
other
members
of
their
own
party
were
happy
with
this
but
somewhere
down
the
yellow
brick
road
they
looked
around
and
said
there's
not
all
of
us
here
people
aren't
following
anymore
he
said
collins
was
referring
to
an
increasingly
vocal
group
of
democrats
unhappy
at
the
impeachment
focus
fearing
it
is
a
politically
futile
move
and
is
distracting
from
kitchen-table
issues
of
greater
concern
to
voters
but
in
other
parts
of
the
country
democratic
activists
and
left-wing
lawmakers
are
fired
up
at
the
idea
of
ousting
the
president
skeptical
lawmakers
in
places
like
new
jersey
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
were
peppered
with
questions
during
the
august
recess
by
angry
democrats
demanding
they
back
impeachment
you
are
going
to
give
donald
trump
another
four
years
by
doing
that
you
are
helping
him
you
are
helping
him
get
another
four
years
rep
steven
lynch
d-mass
told
a
furious
crowd
last
month
according
to
politico
but
democrats
are
moving
toward
that
position
even
if
they
are
not
united
at
least
house
members
now
support
an
inquiry
including
members
of
the
judiciary
committee
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
has
long
expressed
her
skepticism
about
impeachment
urging
democrats
to
zero
in
on
issues
such
as
climate
change
health
care
and
the
economy
instead
last
month
she
was
heckled
by
unhappy
protesters
at
a
dinner
in

asked
by

on
monday
if
she
supported
nadler
pelosi
said
yes
i
do
i
think
you
should
characterize
it
for
what
it
is
it's
a
continuation
of
what
we
have
been
doing
she
said
you
know
we
all
work
together
on
