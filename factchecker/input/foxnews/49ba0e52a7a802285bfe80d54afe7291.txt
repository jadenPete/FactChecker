hong

formally
withdraws
extradition
bill
the
chinese
communist
party
has
systematically
pursued
a
policy
of
joining
and
exploiting
international
organizations
to
advance
their
agenda
the
pattern
is
the
same
across
issues
as
varied
as
the
wto
internet
governance
interpol
and
human
rights
bodies

said
the

who
sits
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
called
on
the

in
a
leadership
position
especially
one
with
a
direct
history
of
advancing
china's
abuses
in
hong
kong
the
trump
administration
should
use
its
voice
and
vote
to
block
this
appointment
as
hong
kong
police
chief
in
tsang
was
responsible
for
putting
down
pro-democracy
protesters
who
demanded
democratic
elections

more
recently
he

director
for
its

commission
gordon
chang
a
china
expert
told
fox

that
tsang
was
known
to
be
a
hardliner
when
he
ran
the
hong
kong
police
he
headed
the
police
in
when
the
police
used
tear
gas
during
the
occupy
protests
chang
said
the
use
of
tear
gas
reignited
the
protests
as
ordinary
citizens
immediately
turned
off
their
televisions
and
took
to
the
streets
to
show
their
indignation
tsang
whether
he
made
the
decision
to
use
tear
gas
or
merely
followed
the
orders
of
chief
executive
c.
y.
leung
was
held
responsible
for
one
of
the
worst
moves
during
that
time
hong
kong
police
arrest
at
least
pro-democracy
activists
chang
also
noted
tsang's
current
position
any
candidate
proposed
for
a
drug
enforcement
post
by
a
one-party
state
behind
some
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
drug
networks
should
be
rejected
out
of
hand
he
said
tsang
did
not
stop
china's
fentanyl
rings
even
though
he
had
all
the
tools
of
a
semi-totalitarian
state
at
his
disposal
he
asked
is
he
really
going
to
be
more
effective
because
he
would
move
to
vienna
this
would
be
a
hideous
appointment
but
beijing's
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
said
over
the
summer
that
tsang's
candidacy
demonstrated
china's
concrete
action
in
support
of
multilateralism
and
work

un
we
will
devote
more
efforts

china
in
recent

not
retreating
from

and
said
the
administration
was
well
aware
of
china's

china's
concerted
push
has
more
to
do

authoritarian
model
