texas
beto
o'rourke
who
has
aimed
to
rebuild
his
struggling
campaign
on
a
platform
of
confiscating
firearms
declared
sunday
at
a
rally
in
plano
texas
that
president
trump
has
the
blood
of
the
el
paso
mass
shooting
victims
on
his
hands
o'rourke
specifically
referenced
a
may
rally
in
florida
although
commentators
have
disputed
that
trump
in
fact
endorsed
mass
shootings
during
his
speech
at
a
rally
in
florida
in
may
of
this
year
the
president
was
ranting
and
railing
o'rourke
said
referring
to
trump's
comments
about
illegal
immigration
he
says
how
do
we
stop
these
people
from
coming
here
someone
yells
out
shoot
them
el

shooter
indicted
on
capital
mass
shooting
charge
o'rourke
continued
the
crowd
roars
their
assent
the
president
smiles
and
he
laughs
his
consent
what
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
doing
cannot
be
more
dangerous
he
has
the
blood
of
those
people
in
el
paso
on
his
hands
and
the
answer
to
this
has
got
to
be
beyond
defeating
donald
trump
as
important
as
it
is
it
has
to
go
to
the
root
of
this
problem
o'rourke
went
on
to
name
white
supremacy
as
an
existential
threat
video
of
the
trump
rally
showed
that
trump
started
discussing
a
migrant
caravan
making
its
way
to
the
southern
border
don't
forget
we
don't
let
them
and
we
can't
let
them
use
weapons
other
countries
do
we
can't
i
would
never
do
that
after
someone
yelled
shoot
them
trump
smiled
shook
his
head
and
replied
that's
only
in
the
panhandle
you
can
get
away
with
that
statement
the
national
review's
rich
lowry
wrote
that
the
president
in
context
clearly
was
joking
clearly
this
is
not
meant
as
an
endorsement
of
the
statement
but
a
good-natured
way
to
acknowledge
its
outrageousness
lowry
wrote
the
idea
that
this
shouted
interruption
in
the
midst
of
a
long
trump
riff
about
how
we
need
to
make
lawful
changes
to
address
the
border
crisis
somehow
constitutes
presidential
incitement
to
mass
murder
is
manifestly
absurd

robert
francis
o'rourke
has
flip-flopped
on
the
issue
of
gun
confiscation
when
he
was
running
for
the
senate
last
year
in
texas
he
explicitly
opposed
the
government
taking
ar-
rifles
but
during
last
week's
presidential
primary
debate
o'rourke
said
flatly
hell
yes
when
asked
if
the
government
should
confiscate
ar-
s
the
former
texas
representative
later
clarified
that
he
did
not
anticipate
the
need
for
government
agents
to
go
door-to-door
because
people
simply
would
comply
with
the
law
voluntarily
