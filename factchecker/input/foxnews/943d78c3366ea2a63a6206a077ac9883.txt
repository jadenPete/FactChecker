condemning

for

on
two
saudi
oil
facilities
which
he
described
as
an
unprecedented
attack
on
the
world's
energy

tehran
is
behind
nearly
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
while
president
hassan
rouhani
and
foreign
minister
mohammad
zarif
pretend
to
engage
in
diplomacy
pompeo
tweeted
referring
to
the

and
foreign
affairs
minister
there
is
no

the
attacks
came
from
yemen
iran-backed

responsibility
for
the
attack
hours
before
pompeo's
tweet
the
world's
largest
oil
processing
facility
in
saudi
arabia
and
a
major
oil
field
were
impacted
sparking

claimed
by

the
united

will
work
with
our
partners
and
allies
to
ensure
that
energy
markets
remain
well
supplied
and
iran
is
held
accountable
for
its
aggression
pompeo
concluded
according
to
multiple
news
reports
that
cited
unidentified
sources
the
drone
attacks
affected
up
to
half
of
the
supplies
from
the
world's
largest
exporter
of
oil
though
the
output
should
be
restored
within
days
it
remained
unclear
if
anyone
was
injured
at
the
abqaiq
oil
processing
facility
and
the
khurais

field
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
who
sits
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
denounced
pompeo's
description
of
the
attack
calling
it
an
irresponsible
simplification
the
saudis
and
houthis
are
at
war
the
saudis
attack
the
houthis
and
the
houthis
attack
back
iran
is
backing
the
houthis
and
has
been
a
bad
actor
but
it's
just
not
as
simple
as
houthis
iran
he
added
saturday's
attack
comes
after
weeks
of
similar
drone
assaults
on
the
kingdom's
oil
infrastructure
but
none
of
the
earlier
strikes
appeared
to
have
caused
the
same
amount
of
damage
the
attack
likely
will
heighten
tensions
further
across
the
persian
gulf
amid
an
escalating
crisis
between
the
u.s.
and
iran
over
its
unraveling
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
in
a
short
address
aired
by
the
houthi-controlled
al-masirah
satellite
news
channel
military
spokesman
yahia
sarie
said
the
rebels
launched
drones
after
receiving
intelligence
support
from
those
inside
the
kingdom
he
warned
that
attacks
by
the
rebels
would
only
get
worse
if
the
war
continues
the
only
option
for
the
saudi
government
is
to
stop
attacking
us
sarie
said
the
rebels
hold
yemen's
capital
sanaa
and
other
parts
f
the
arab
world's
poorest
country
since
a
saudi-led
coalition
has
fought
to
reinstate
the
internationally
recognized
yemeni

martin

the
united

special
envoy
for
yemen
called
the
strikes
extremely
worrying
and
urged
all
parties
to
prevent
such
further
incidents
which
pose
a
serious
threat
to
regional
security
complicate
the
already
fragile
situation
and
jeopardize
the
