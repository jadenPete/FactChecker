found
no
evidence
of
misconduct
by
secretary
ben
carson
concerning
a
controversial
order
for
expensive
furniture
in
late
the
watchdog
completed
the
report
wednesday
after
more
than
a
year
investigating
whether
carson
and
his
wife
improperly
tried
to
purchase
a
dining
set
for
his
office
as
part
of
a
costly
makeover

the
findings
ben
carson's
hud
cancels
order
for
g
dining
set
after
complaint
the
inspector
general
found
that
carson
left
the
matter
of
purchasing
furniture
to
members
of
his
staff
to
handle
in
consultation
with
his
wife
who
provided
stylistic
input
after
the
department
decided
to
purchase
new
furniture
we
found
no
evidence
indicating
that
either
secretary
or
mrs
carson
exerted
improper
influence
on
any
departmental
employee
in
connection
with
the
procurement
the
report
stated
we
did
not
find
sufficient
evidence
to
substantiate
allegations
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
secretary
carson
in
connection
with
this
procurement
speaking
on
fox
business
network's
varney
co
carson
said
the
report
proves
what
he's
been
saying
all
along
i
was
so
disgusted
with
that
story
because
they
try
to
claim
that
i
want
to
buy
expensive
furniture
while
i'm
trying
to
take
money
away
from
the
poor
people
he
said
there's
probably
no
one
in
washington
who
cares
less
about
furniture
than
i
do
the
inspector
general
found
that
hud
staff
initiated
a
process
in
mid-
to
replace
the
dining
room
furniture
in
carson's
suite
hud
officials
obligated
in
departmental
funds
on
dec
for
the
purchase
of
new
dining
room
furniture
but
did
not
make
required
notification
to
the
house
and
senate's
appropriations
committees
before
doing
so
hud
though
ultimately
did
not
get
the
furniture
the
order
was
canceled
on
march
at
the
direction
of
carson
in
response
to
media
reports
the
inspector
general
wrote
that
they
are
not
making
any
recommendations
to
the
department
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
gathered
in
this
investigation
because
we
found
no
evidence
of
misconduct
and
because
the
department
is
working
to
address
the
legal
ramifications
of
the
dining-room
furniture
procurement
and
to
prevent
future
appropriations-law
violations

the
investigation
began
last
year
after
hud's
former
chief
administrative
officer
helen
foster
complained
that
she
was
retaliated
against
for
objecting
to
the
cost
of
the
dining
room
set
saying
it
was
beyond
the
statutory
maximum
for
office
updates
foster
said
she
was
demoted
for
refusing
to
bankroll
the
remodeling
and
claimed
it
was
requested
by
carson's
wife
amid
an
environment
where
top
officials
told
her
to
skirt
the
rules
foster
said
she
was
told
the
department
has
always
found
money
for
this
in
the
past
and
that
will
not
even
buy
a
decent
chair
the
department
said
in
response
to
that
report
that
carson
decorated
his
office
mainly
with
furniture
from
the
agency's
basement
and
did
not
ask
for
a
new
dining
set
instead
hud
blamed
it
on
career
staffers
the
department
also
denied
retaliation
saying
that
foster
is
still
a
hud
employee
and
that
it
is
customary
for
staffers
to
be
rotated
