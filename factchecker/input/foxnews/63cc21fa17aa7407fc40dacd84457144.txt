website
says
she
wants
to
enhance
medicare
and
social
security

appeared
to
take
a
shot
at
medicare-for-all
a
plan
championed
by
progressives
like
ocasio-cortez
she
will
fight
to
make
sure
health
care
is
made
available
for
all
and
that
those
who
have
existing
coverage
can
choose
to
keep

they
currently
have
the
site
said
apparently
referring
to
concerns
that
medicare-for-all
would
take
away
private
insurance
