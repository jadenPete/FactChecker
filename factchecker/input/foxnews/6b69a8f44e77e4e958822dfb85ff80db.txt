wins
the

on
party's

a
real
democratic
debate
after
two
rounds
of
two-night
bean
bag
competitions
we
got
some
tough
questions
sharp
distinctions
and
a
real
sense
of
what
this
race
looks
like
much
of
the
credit
does
go
to
abc
news
which
for
the
most
part
offered
challenging
questions
centered
on
the
issues
that
matter
most
to
democrats
who
are
considering
their
choices
for
next
year
but
some
of
the
credit
belongs
to
happenstance
since
the
democratic
national
committee's
balky
participation-trophy
rules
meant
that
the
first
two
debates
were
actually
glorified
candidate
forums
featuring
various
odd
lots
what
democrats
saw
thursday
should
generally
be
encouraging
for
their
hopes
in
there
were
multiple
credible-sounding
voices
most
of
whom
were
capable
of
a
degree
of
debate
that
seemed
if
not
quite
presidential
yet
was
at
least
in
that
vein
there
were
exceptions
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
julian
castro
sounded
like
he
was
delivering
sick
burns
in
a
dorm
room
argument
his
fellow
texan
beto
o'rourke
was
not
much
better
they
both
brought
with
them
the
anger
and
resentment
of
candidates
who
feel
they
have
been
unfairly
overlooked
for
their
wondrous
gifts
california
sen
kamala
harris
had
a
different
struggle
you
could
almost
hear
the
shouts
of
her
advisers
telling
her
to
be
warm
relatable
and
personal
damnit
it
got
cringey
and
then
it
just
got
stale
harris
is
a
personality
in
search
of
a
platform
and
she
did
not
find
it
on
thursday
night
speaking
of
performative
candidates
andrew
yang
probably
added
to
his
cult
following
enough
so
that
he
will
be
around
next
month
and
maybe
even
the
month
after
that
but
he
also
made
it
clear
he's
not
really
running
for
president
we
imagine
he
will
have
to
wear
a
suit
made
out
of
bills
for
the
next
go
around
cory
booker
may
or
may
not
be
in
the
running
for
president
but
he
most
certainly
cut
a
fine
figure
as
a
running
mate
in
houston
gone
were
his
tears
of
rage
replaced
with
a
beatific
smile
and
an
encouragement
to
unity
it
was
easy
to
see
him
as
the
wingman
for
one
of
the
older
whiter
candidates
at
the
center
of
the
stage
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
seemed
presidential
but
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
he
seemed
normal
reasonable
and
ready
after
a
series
of
setbacks
this
summer
buttigieg
seemed
to
stabilize
he
too
might
make
a
fine
veep
pick
we
wince
at
tropes
like
breakout
performance
but
if
anyone
on
the
stage
shouldered
their
way
into
the
discussion
it
was
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
she
has
improved
during
her
mostly
under-the-radar
campaign
and
seemed
more
at
ease
and
more
purposeful
on
thursday
than
she
had
before
heading
the
other
direction
is
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
not
that
it
matters
sanders
support
seems
mostly
to
be
an
article
of
faith
at
this
point
rather
than
a
candidate
preference
so
as
long
as
he
feels
the
bern
his
fans
will
too
sounding
like
a
bible-beating
preacher
with
a
brooklyn
accent
a
red-faced
sanders
thundered
at
the
evils
of
the
world
elizabeth
warren
senator
from
massachusetts
was
sure-footed
in
most
of
her
answers
and
continued
her
strategy
of
not
directly
engaging
her
rivals
an
approach
that
has
served
her
well
to
this
point
but
she
also
revealed
the
liabilities
for
a
candidate
who
has
charmed
reporters
by
delivering
reams
of
policy
papers
her
proposals
are
complex
costly
and
packed
with
controversial
positions
warren
wanted
you
to
see
her
as
a
girl
of
modest
means
who
grew
into
a
school
teacher
who
now
can
bring
her
simple
home-spun
wisdom
to
bear
on
the
confounding
problems
of
a
complicated
world
that
didn't
quite
hold
up
warren
can
expect
additional
scrutiny
not
just
on
her
proposals
but
also
on
the
tidy
biographical
picture
she
has
painted
and
what
to
say
about
joe
biden
the
democrats
front-runner
certainly
didn't
do
himself
any
harm
and
in
fact
managed
to
put
the
quietus
on
questions
about
his
age
and
alleged
incapacity
there
were
no
major
gaffes
and
he
even
managed
a
couple
of
spin
moves
even
if
his
footwork
was
gingerly
biden's
greatest
success
of
the
summer
was
revealed
on
thursday
democrats
had
been
considering
the
question
of
whether
an
obamian
restoration
was
a
good
enough
policy
goal
castro
o'rourke
and
sanders
were
clear
that
barack
obama's
legacy
is
not
a
worthy
summit
for
democrats
to
seek
echoing
the
language
of
long-shot
ideologues
throughout
history
they
assured
listeners
that
anyone
on
the
stage
would
win
next
fall
and
that
the
real
issue
was
getting
someone
elected
who
is
sufficiently
radical
michele
bachmann
and
ron
paul
would
have
been
proud
but
that's
not
where
democrats
heads
are
whether
it
is
moderation
for
the
sake
of
electability
or
for
its
own
sake
the
party's
voters
have
made
it
clear
that
they
are
not
interested
in
what's
new
or
what's
radical
and
no
one
could
say
that
biden
is
either
of
those
things
just
ask
him
what's
in
his
record
collection
that
admission
on
the
parts
of
other
candidates
on
the
stage
is
a
boon
to
biden
who
has
draped
himself
in
the
regalia
of
the
th
president
in
it
was
hope
and
change
for
it's
fear
and
nostalgia
as
long
as
biden
can
keep
taking
punches
and
remember
his
footwork
he
will
be
hard
to
knock
out
the
rulebook
let's
get
it
straight
the
just
imputations
on
our
own
faith
in

that

out

to

his

for

that

private

keith

n.m.
ed
note
over
time
mr
tolk
the
federal
government
has
asserted
and
been
affirmed
in
some
authority
over
firearms
you
may
not
purchase
a
machine
gun
a
bazooka
or
a
howitzer
under
federal
law
though
apparently
flame
throwers
are
legit
similarly
to
your
point
i
suppose
that
most
firearms
purchases
that
take
place
at
licensed
gun
dealers
are
made
by
in-state
residents
but
the
feds
don't
base
their
authority
on
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
but
rather
law-enforcement
concerns
the
effect
of
requiring
background
checks
for
all
sales
would
basically
be
imposing
the
same
requirements
for
gun
dealers
on
individual
citizens
in
these
transactions
i'm
sure
there
are
people
who
argue
that
federal
regulations
around
say
automatic
weapons
are
unconstitutional
perhaps
there's
even
a
case
to
be
made
but
so
far
courts
have
upheld
limited
federal
regulation
even
as
judges
have
become
more
adamant
about
individuals
personal
rights
to
keep
and
bear
arms

george
will's
latest
book
the
conservative
sensibility
some
of
it
is
devoted
to
will's
prescription
for
our
current
politics
but
the
overwhelming
majority
is
about
our
founding
and
the
intellectual
history
of
the
modern
conservative
and
progressive
movements
your
teenager
might
enjoy
it
david
mccullough's
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
grew
out
of
mccullough's
masterful
biography
of
john
adams
but
expands
out
to
take
in
the
scope
of
that
moment
in
time
and
the
remarkable
men
and
women
who
populated
it
but
what
about
a
third
grader
she
may
already
be
too
old
for
the
wonderful
series
childhoods
of
famous
americans
my
third
grader
loved
them
and
they
certainly
work
to
make
the
subject
accessible
i'm
not
sure
which
history
books
you
use
but
i
have
been
endlessly
impressed
by
the
story
of
the
world
i
have
enjoyed
it
along
with
my
sons
in
their
studies
at
school
