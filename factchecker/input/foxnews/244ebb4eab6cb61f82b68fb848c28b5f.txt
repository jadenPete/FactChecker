touts
construction
of
new
border
wall
sections
in
an
exclusive
interview
on
fox
friends
thursday
president
trump
told
fox
news
ed
henry
that
brand-new
wall
sections
have
been
built
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
contrary
to
claims
by
some
democrats
trump
said
the
new
wall
sections
include
miles
at
the
site
in
california
where
the
interview
was
held
this
was
not
here
two
weeks
ago
this
is
all
brand-new
wall
we're
building
on
many
different
sites
all
up
and
down
along
the
border
he
said
adding
that
the
new
foot
barrier
was
impenetrable
even
by
championship
mountain
climbers
trump
said
maneuvers
by
his
administration
to
secure
the
u.s.
mexico
border
have
resulted
in
a
major
drop
in
illegal
crossings
and
a
safer
working
environment

border

we
wish
we
had
help
from
the
democrats
in
congress
but
they
said
they
want
open
borders
the
president
said
during
the
wide-ranging
interview
with
henry
they
don't
want
this
they
want
criminals
to
come
in
illegal
immigration
has
been
a
key
topic
at
recent
democratic
debates
and
the
difference
between
trump's
vision
and
the
democratic
field
could
not
be
clearer
some
democratic
candidates
want
to
decriminalize
illegal
border
crossing
while
leaving
it
as
a
civil
offense
they
include
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
south
bend
ind
mayor
pete
buttigieg
trump's
claim
that
illegal
border
crossings
are
down
could
be
based
off
preliminary
government
figures
obtained
by
politico
earlier
this
month
that
said
the
numbers
are
down
percent
since
the
peak
in
may

fox
news
app
much
of
the
credit
for
the
drop
was
given
to
trump's
agreement
with
the
mexican
government
in
june
that
resulted
in
the
country
intercepting
migrants
from
central
america
before
reaching
the
border
i
think
that
they
are
getting
exactly
what
they
said
they
would
get
by
forcing
the
hand
of
mexico
one
immigration
expert
from
a
pro-migrant
group
told
politico
but
the
question
is
is
it
sustainable
