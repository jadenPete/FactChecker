o'rourke's
vow
to
take
ar-
s
from
gun
owners
appears
to
represent
a
stark
reversal
from
his
failed
senate
run
last
year
at
thursday
night's
democratic
presidential
debate
o'rourke
was
pressed
by
abc's
world
news
tonight
anchor
david
muir
about
whether
he
was
proposing
taking
away
guns
from
lawful
gun
owners
he
said
he
was
specifically
weapons
designed
to
kill
people
on
a
battlefield
when
we
see
that
being
used
against
children
and
in
odessa
i
met
the
mother
of
a
year-old
girl
who
was
shot
by
an
ar-
and
that
mother
watched
her
bleed
to
death
over
the
course
of
an
hour
because
so
many
other
people
were
shot
by
that
ar-
in
odessa
and
midland
there
weren't
enough
ambulances
to
get
to
them
in
time
he
said
o'rourke's
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
also
was
the
scene
of
a
recent
mass
shooting
he
then
vowed
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
his
campaign
has
even
produced
a
shirt
with
the
slogan
however
o'rourke
had
a
much
different
stance
when
he
was
running
for
senate
during
an
interview
on
the
chad
hasty
show
in
april
the
host
asked
i
own
an
ar-
a
lot
of
our
listeners
out
there
own
ar-
s
why
should
they
not
have
one
to
be
clear
they
should
have
them
o'rourke
responded
if
you
purchased
that
ar-
if
you
own
it
keep
it
continue
to
use
it
responsibly
he
added
later
in
the
same
interview
if
you
own
a
gun
keep
that
gun
nobody
wants
to
take
it
away
from
you
at
least

don't
want
to
do
