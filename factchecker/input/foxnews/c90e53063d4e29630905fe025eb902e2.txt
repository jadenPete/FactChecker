reports
house
republicans
are
facing
a
steep
climb
to
regain
the
majority
in
as
mounting
retirements
in
the
party
complicate
their
efforts
to
wrest
the
gavel
from
speaker
nancy
pelosi
but
they
may
have
been
given
a
political
gift
this
past
week
when
democrats
doubled
down
on
their
pursuit
of
an
impeachment
investigation
against
president
trump
the
move
came
after
republicans
already
were
enjoying
a
dose
of
good
news
on
the
congressional
campaign
front
the
party's
narrow
win
in
the
special
congressional
election
in
north
carolina
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
touted
that
the
victory
is
yet
another
sign
that
congressional
republicans
are
poised
to
take
back
the
majority
dems
admit
trump
helped
gop
sweep
special
congressional
elections
in
north
carolina
a
day
later
the
house
judiciary
committee
took
a
step
with
potentially
bigger
implications
approving
a
resolution
defining
the
panel's
impeachment
probe
in
the
first
official
vote
on
the
matter
more
than
half
of
democratic
lawmakers
in
the
house
support
launching
impeachment
proceedings
yet
considering
the
gop-controlled
senate
is
unlikely
to
act
on
any
possible
impeachment
articles
from
the
house
moderate
democrats
in
the
house
loudly
warned
that
their
colleagues
are
walking
into
a
political
trap
those
facing
tough
reelections
next
year
in
districts
trump
captured
in
specifically
raised
flags
that
impeachment
could
hurt
the
party's
efforts
to
defend
its
majority
there's
one
independent
house
member
in
the
chamber
democratic
rep
anthony
brindisi
told
fox
news
on
thursday
that
he's
concerned
i'm
worried
that
as
the
investigation
ramps
up
it
takes
up
time
from
other
issues
and
the
congressman
who
represents
a
red
district
said
he
would
vote
no
on
impeachment
unless
there
is
something
compelling
that
comes
out
house
dems
aren't
actually
impeaching
the
president
yet
rep
donna
shalala
of
florida
who
flipped
her
miami
area
district
from
red
to
blue
in
last
year's
midterm
elections
told
reporters
that
impeachment
is
sucking
the
air
out
of
all
the
good
stuff
that
we're
doing
and
she
warned
that
it's
difficult
for
house
democrats
to
focus
on
issues
crucial
to
their
voters
given
the
platform
shalala
spotlighted
that
she
only
fielded
four
impeachment
questions
during
a
total
of
town
halls
in
her
district
during
the
recent
congressional
recess
rep
tulsi
gabbard
of
hawaii
who
doesn't
support
impeachment
cautioned
last
week
that
it's
important
for
us
to
think
about
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
country
and
the
american
people
and
in
an
interview
on
full
court
press
with
greta
van
susteren
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
argued
that
continuing
to
pursue
impeachment
is
something
that
i
think
will
only
further
tear
our
country
apart
while
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
pledged
an
aggressive
series
of
hearings
and
said
his
panel's
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
pelosi
and
other
democratic
house
leaders
mindful
of
more
moderate
members
facing
challenging
reelections
have
largely
refrained
from
using
that
terminology
speaking
with
reporters
pelosi
avoided
using
the
term
impeachment
inquiry
while
the
judiciary
committee's
move
could
be
a
gift
to
the
house
gop
a
national
democratic
strategist
who
works
on
house
races
cautioned
that
republicans
are
getting
ahead
of
themselves
if
they
think
is
going
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
impeachment
the
strategist
who
asked
for
anonymity
to
speak
more
freely
said
i
don't
think
the
american
public's
perception
has
really
shifted
if
you
ask
the
average
voter
i
don't
think
they're
differentiating
between
what
the
judiciary
committee
was
doing
last
week
and
what
they're
doing
this
week
that's
very
very
insider
and
probably
half
the
people
in
d.c.
that
you
talk
to
wouldn't
even
be
able
to
tell
you
the
difference
i
think
that
they're
reading
too
much
into
that
the
judiciary
committee
vote
comes
with
house
republicans
now
heading
for
the
exit
door
in
and
only
two
of
those
gop
lawmakers
are
launching
statewide
bids
for
governor
or
senator
the
rest
are
truly
retiring
that's
a
switch
from
two
years
ago
when
at
the
same
point
in
the
cycle
nine
of
the
house
republicans
not
running
for
reelection
were
bidding
for
higher
office
the
democrats
thanks
to
a
seat
pickup
in
the
midterms
regained
the
majority
after
eight
years
as
backbenchers
by
contrast
only
four
house
democrats
so
far
this
cycle
have
said
they're
not
running
for
reelection
for
many
of
these
republicans
it's
the
first
time
being
in
the
minority
and
being
in
the
minority
in
the
house
is
a
tough
place
to
be
you
have
to
be
responsive
to
an
ever-present
president
and
defend
him
which
is
not
fun
noted
ty
matsdorf
a
veteran
democratic
strategist
who
recently
served
as
independent
expenditure
director
at
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
looking
at
the
recent
spate
of
gop
house
retirements
matsdorf
said
it's
always
a
good
indicator
of
more
to
come
when
you
see
waves
like
this
because
it
tells
you
that
there's
something
systemically
wrong
and
matsdorf
predicted
that
between
now
and
january
we'll
see
the
bulk
of
the
rest
of
the
republican
retirements
longtime
republican
strategist
colin
reed
concurred
that
nobody
likes
being
in
the
minority
it's
just
a
reality
of
life
and
he
noted
that
typically
when
the
control
of
the
lower
chambers
switches
hands
you
can
see
an
exodus
of
retirements
in
the
ensuing
years
as
former
chairs
get
used
to
life
as
ranking
members
of
the
minority
reed
acknowledged
that
it's
indisputable
that
the
retirements
in
recent
weeks
have
not
been
helpful
to
the
republican
cause
he
argued
that
the
party
reclaiming
the
majority
remains
unlikely
only
a
handful
of
the
house
gop
retirements
are
in
swing
districts
however
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
the
top
house
republican
told
reporters
on
friday
let
me
be
very
frank
i'm
not
concerned
about
any
retirement
he
then
added
one
exception
retiring
rep
will
hurd
of
texas
democrats
are
eyeing
the
seat
as
a
potential
pickup
mccarthy
spoke
three
days
after
republican
dan
bishop's
victory
tuesday
in
a
special
election
in
north
carolina
which
was
touted
by
pundits
as
a
bellwether
of
things
to
come
in
gave
the
gop
a
much-needed
boost
but
his
narrow
margin
over
democrat
dan
mccready
in
a
district
where
the
gop
has
a
distinct
advantage
didn't
erase
fears
that
house
republicans
are
still
facing
fierce
headwinds
in
matsdorf
argued
that
if
bishop
had
lost
it
would
have
sparked
a
flood
of
house
gop
retirements
he
noted
that
the
republican
victory
in
the
special
election
will
slow
the
retirements
but
not
completely
because
this
is
a
republican
seat

reed
downplayed
the
impact
of
the
contest
saying
he
hesitates
to
place
much
emphasis
on
special

i
think
political
prognosticators
make
too
much
of
extrapolating
outcomes
of
special
