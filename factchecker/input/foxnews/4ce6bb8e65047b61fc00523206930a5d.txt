and

involves
president
trump's
communications
with
a
foreign
leader
according
to
two
former
u.s.
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
trump's
interaction
with
the
foreign
leader
included
a
promise
that
was
regarded
as
so
troubling
that
it
prompted
an
official
in

u.s.

community
to
file
a
formal
whistleblower
complaint
with
the
inspector
general
for
the
intelligence
community
said
the
former
officials
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
matter
publicly
it
was
not
immediately
clear
which
foreign
leader
trump
was
speaking
with
or
what
he
pledged
to
deliver
but
his
direct
involvement
in
the
matter
has
not
been
previously
disclosed
it
raises
new
questions
about
the
president's
handling
of
sensitive
information
and
may
further
strain
his
relationship
with
u.s.
spy
agencies
one

said
the
communication
was

came

briefed
