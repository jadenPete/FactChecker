further
suggesting

trump
is
looking

that

generally
win

that

conditions
as
they
did

on

nevada

and

enthusiasm
was
apparent
as
the

touted

economic
successes
and
demanded

resignations
of

accusation

the

was
the
product
of
a
carefully
planned
data-driven
strategy
to
identify
supporters
attract
them
to
a
rally
and
ultimately
convert
them
into
voters
a
plan
that
goes
well
beyond
producing
a
compelling
scene
for

an
era
where

it's
efficient
but
also
fun
said
tessa
simonds
the
warren
campaign's
director
of
grassroots
mobilization
warren
has
mastered
the
art
of
drawing
thousands
to
her
rallies
but
more
importantly
those
turning
out
are
also
a
proxy
for
her
recent
rise
in
the
polls
and
the
crowds
have
been
building
for
weeks
in
places
that
have
received
relatively
little
attention
from
other
candidates
including
seattle
and
minneapolis
in
the
enormous
crowds
who
flocked
to
see
bernie
sanders
were
an
early
sign
of
the
enthusiasm
that
would
build
around
his
campaign
and
lead
him
to
nearly
defeat
hillary
clinton
for
the
democratic
nomination
this
cycle
sanders
and
other
democrats
have
also
staged
large
rallies
but
it
is
warren
who
seems
to
hold
the
energy
edge
trump's
large
crowds
four
years
ago
hinted
at
his
coming
election
day
upset
similarly
barack
obama
was
still
largely
unknown
nationally
when
he
launched
his
presidential
bid
in
yet
demonstrated
his
early
strength
by
drawing
at
a
super
bowl
sunday
rally
in
delaware
when
you
get
a
big
crowd
and
reporters
are
covering
that
and
they're
like
wow
there's
a
lot
of
energy
in
the
room
that
can
absolutely
get
you
free

media
said
brendan
steinhauser
a
republican
strategist
and
former
top
conservative
grassroots
organizer

if
we
learned
anything
from
earned

is
really
valuable

at

big

aren't
everything
many
democrats
bitterly
remember
throngs

and
jon
bon
jovi
in
front
of
philadelphia's
independence
hall
the
night
before
trump's
victory
democrat
walter
mondale
attracted
massive
crowds
in
new
york
and
boston
days
before
losing
out
of
states
including
new
york
and
massachusetts
to
president
ronald
reagan
that's
because
large
rallies
can
show
enthusiasm
but
often
aren't
good
indicators
of
whether
support
is
growing
beyond
a
candidate's
established
base
the
people
who
show
up
to
such
events
tend
to
be
self-selecting
people
travel
from
california
to
attend

it's
all
reinforcing
the
data
plus
the
visuals
on

feed
more
people
in
the
crowds
said
joe
trippi
former
campaign
manager
for
howard
dean
who
organized
early
rallies
large
enough
to
briefly
become
a
democratic
front-runner
but
when
voting
began
it
became
clear
that
the
former
vermont
governor
was
more
effective
at
building
ballyhooed
crowds
than
winning
votes
the
issue
is
going
to
be
all
that
buzz
on
television
and
online
and
the
resources
that
it
gets
you
does
that
expand
beyond
that
base
support

asked

judging
crowd
size
is
subjective
meanwhile
and
can
be
so
politically
charged
that
police
sometimes
refuse
to
offer
official
estimates
warren's
campaign
says
its
crowd-size
estimates
partially
come
from
staffers
and
volunteers
using
counting
clickers
to
gauge
the
number
of
attendees
the
warren
campaign
won't
discuss
its
targeting
of
would-be
supporters
nor
would
it
touch
analytical
components
like
how
many
people
it
has
on
nationwide
donor
volunteer
or
supporter
lists
aides
concede
they
hope
anyone
invited
to
rallies
will
increase
turnout
by
bringing
friends
neighbors
or
relatives
but
refuse
to
quantify
how
many
new
attendees
such
scenarios
tend
to
generate
still
attracting

the

warren
volunteers

primary
choices

will
like
