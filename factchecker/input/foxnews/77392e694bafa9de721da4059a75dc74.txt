democratic
presidential
candidate
sen
elizabeth
warren
on
thursday
unveiled
a
plan
to
increase
monthly
social
security
benefits
by
for
every
current
and
future
beneficiary
the
plan
which
the
massachusetts
democrat
touted
as
the
biggest
and
most
progressive
increase
in
social
security
benefits
in
nearly
half
a
century
was
released
hours
before
warren
joins
nine
of
her
rivals
for
the
third-round
democratic
primary
debate
warren
says
democrats
can't
choose
a
candidate
we
don't
believe
in
because
we're
scared
in
likely
jab
at
biden
warren
said
that
the
typical
social
security
benefits
today
are
quite
small
noting
the
average
beneficiary
receives
a
month
or
a
year
nearly
million
americans
are
social
security
beneficiaries
and
here's
the
even
scarier
part
unless
we
act
now
future
retirees
are
going
to
be
in
even
worse
shape
than
the
current
ones
she
stressed
warren's
proposal
also
calls
for
updating
what
she
describes
as
outdated
rules
to
further
increase
benefits
for
lower-income
families
women
people
with
disabilities
public-sector
workers
and
people
of
color
the
populist
senator
who
has
released
one
progressive
policy
proposal
after
another
this
year
as
she
runs
for
the
white
house
says
she'll
pay
for
extending
the
solvency
of
social
security
by
nearly
two
decades
with
revenues
from
her
plan
to
tax
the
wealthiest
americans
the
latest
from
fox
news
on
the
presidential
campaign
warren
included
an
independent
analysis
from
moody's
analytics
chief
economist
mark
zandi
that
indicated
the
senator's
plan
would
immediately
lift
an
estimated
million
seniors
out
of
poverty
cutting
the
senior
poverty
rate
by
percent
zandi
also
claimed
that
warren's
proposal
which
calls
for
raising
contribution
requirements
on
the
top
earners
and
boosting
average
benefits
by
nearly
percent
for
those
in
the
bottom
half
of
income
distribution
would
produce
a
much
more
progressive
social
security
system
as
social
security
recipients
live
longer
the
number
of
beneficiaries
is
projected
to
surge
to
million
people
and
a
slowing
population
means
fewer
younger
workers
to
pay
into
the
system
raising
solvency
concerns
the
latest
projections
from
the
social
security
board
of
trustees
indicate
the
reserves
used
to
partially
fund
the
system
are
expected
to
be
depleted
