california
announced
last
week
that
it
has
added
iowa
to
the
list
of
states
on
its
ever-expanding
travel
ban
list
because
of
that
state's
new
prohibition
against
funding
gender-transition
surgeries
under
medicaid
the
announcement
by
state
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
means
that
as
of
oct
california
will
no
longer
offer
taxpayer-funded
trips
to
iowa
for
any
public
employee
or
student
at
a
state-run
university
becerra's
authority
came
from
a
california
law
signed
by
then-gov
jerry
brown
that
bars
state-funded
travel
to
other
states
that
undercut
lgbt
rights
the
blacklist
already
included
alabama
kentucky
north
carolina
texas
oklahoma
and
mississippi
watch
liberal
policies
blamed
for
worsening
california's
homelessness
crisis
conservatives
have
called
the
law
ineffective
inconveniencing
possibly
unconstitutional
and
hypocritical
the
state's
sports
teams
have
turned
to
private
funding
to
get
around
the
restrictions
according
to
the
los
angeles
times
the
iowa
legislature
has
reversed
course
on
what
was
settled
law
under
the
iowa
civil
rights
act
repealing
protections
for
those
seeking
gender-affirming
health
care
becerra
said
in
a
statement
california
has
taken
an
unambiguous
stand
against
discrimination
and
government
actions
that
would
enable
it
the
brouhaha
began
after
the
iowa
supreme
court
ruled
in
march
that
taxpayers
could
be
forced
to
pay
for
gender
reassignment
surgery
republican
gov
kim
reynolds
signed
a
law
effectively
overriding
that
ruling
two
months
later
this
narrow
provision
simply
clarifies
that
iowa's
civil
rights
act
does
not
require
taxpayer
dollars
to
pay
for
sex
reassignment
and
other
similar
surgeries
reynolds
spokesman
pat
garrett
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
this
returns
us
to
what
had
been
the
state's
position
for
years
at
the
federal
level
the
trump
administration
has
rolled
back
the
obama-era
determination
that
sex-based
discrimination
prohibitions
under
existing
law
include
protections
for
gender
identity
the
health
and
human
services
department
in
may
angered
progressive
advocates
with
rules
that
both
allowed
doctors
not
to
perform
certain
operations
and
stated
that
gender
identity
was
not
protected
under
sex
discrimination
law
in
