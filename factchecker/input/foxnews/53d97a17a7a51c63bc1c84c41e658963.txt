on

court
of
appeals
adamantly
denied
that
he
harbors
racist
beliefs
or
favors
racial
purity
during
his
confirmation
hearing
wednesday
morning
as
he
responded
to
inflammatory
accusations
against
him
during
questioning
sen
josh
hawley
r-mo
observed
that
nominee
steven
menashi
has
faced
unusually
personal
and
vicious
attacks
of
this
nature
alluding
to
a
segment
on
rachel
maddow's
msnbc
show
in
which
she
discussed
a
law
journal
article
menashi
wrote
in
titled
ethnonationalism
and
liberal
democracy
maddow
cited
menashi's
use
of
the
term
ethnonationalism
to
suggest
he
is
aligned
with
white
nationalists
alleging
he's
on
the
fringe
of
racial
thinking

intentional
distortion
i
absolutely
am
not
menashi
said
it's
hurtful
and
i
think
it
misrepresents
what
i've
written
the
article
published
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
journal
of
international
law
was
about
how
israel
can
be
both
a
jewish
state
and
a
liberal
democracy
in
that
context
he
explained
how
there
is
a
precedent
for
democratic
countries
to
have
a
common
ethnicity
with
shared
qualities
and
ties
to
that
people's
diaspora
when
asked
about
the
article
during
the
hearing
menashi
said
he
was
merely
saying
israel
is
not
out
of
the
norm
he
said
he
was
not
proposing
the
u.s.
should
have
an
ethnically
homogeneous
society
but
noted
that
u.s.
citizens
do
have
a
shared
identity
based
on
constitutional
traditions
menashi
said
not
only
is
he
not
a
proponent
of
racial
purity
he
is
particularly
sensitive
to
ethnic
or
religious
discrimination
because
his
family
members
were
victims
of
such
persecution
he
is
the
descendant
of
iraqi
jews
and
his
paternal
grandparents
fled
iraq
after
kurdish
neighbors
helped
smuggle
his
grandmother
out
of
her
city
from
there
the
family
went
to
iran
and
his
father
was
born
in
tehran
they
eventually
fled
that
country
because
they
could
not
trust
the
courts
to
be
impartial
as
they
would
not
accept
testimony
from
jews
menashi
said
that
on
his
mother's
side
his
grandfather
escaped
ukraine
and
fled
to
poland
eventually
making
his
way
to
the
bronx
relatives
who
remained
in
europe
were
murdered
in
the
holocaust
trump
facing
unprecedented
senate
resistance
to
routine
judicial
nominees
stats
show
another
point
of
contention
during
the
hearing
was
whether
menashi
could
speak
about
legal
advice
he
has
given
in
his
role
with
the
white
house
counsel's
office
he
was
asked
many
questions
about
whether
he
advised
on
particular
issues
such
as
reducing
the
number
of
refugees
allowed
to
enter
the
u.s.
and
policies
having
to
do
with
separating
families
at
the
border
over
and
over
menashi
refused
to
answer
claiming
this
was
protected
by
client
confidentiality
senate
judiciary
committee
members
including
ranking
member
dianne
feinstein
d-calif
and
dick
durbin
d-ill
took
issue
with
menashi's
refusal
to
answer
basic
questions
feinstein
pointed
out
that
when
a
previous
administration
attorney
faced
a
judicial
confirmation
hearing
he
answered
these
questions
chairman
lindsey
graham
r-s
c.
pointed
out
that
in
that
situation
the
committee
spoke
to
the
administration
who
authorized
the
nominee
to
answer
questions
graham
said
that
while
the
committee
could
have
done
the
same
for
menashi
they
did
not
what
you're
doing
here
is
not
fair
graham
said
at
the
same
time
graham
said
that
while
menashi
should
not
be
expected
to
divulge
specific
advice
he
gave
he
should
be
able
to
say
whether
or
not
he
gave
advice
on
those
issues
menashi
still
was
reticent
when
asked
about
giving
advice
on
particular
immigration-related
matters

durbin
eventually
lost
his
temper
during
his
stymied
attempts
to
question
menashi
saying
it
was
inappropriate
for
him
to
even
seek
the
nomination
if
he
would
not
answer
questions
menashi
who
clerked
for
supreme
court
justice
samuel
alito
and
was
a
partner
at
the
law
firm
kirkland
ellis
was
deemed
well
qualified
by
the
american
bar
association
one
topic
where
menashi
was
more
forthcoming
than
recent
judicial
nominees
was
on
brown
v
board
of
education
the
case
that
said
laws
segregating
public
schools
were
unconstitutional
typically
nominees
refrain
from
giving
their
thoughts
on
any
specific
case
in
case
those
issues
come
back
before
the
courts
but
menashi
said
that
brown
is
an
exception
because
of
its
significance
to
american
life
and
he
expressed
his
support
for
the
decision
