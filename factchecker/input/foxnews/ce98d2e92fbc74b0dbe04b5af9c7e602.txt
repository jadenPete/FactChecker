how
far
has
michael
cohen
sunk
in
prison
he's
made
omarosa
manigault
newman
his
new
self-help
guru
a
source
told
page
six
she
apparently
has
taken
on
the
role
of
his
personal
adviser
coach
said
the
source
who
revealed
that
the
former
white
house
staffer
and
apprentice
star
was
spotted
visiting
cohen
at
the
otisville
federal
correctional
institution
in
otisville
new
york
this
summer
the
year-old
former
lawyer
for
president
trump
has
been
in
the
federal
pen
since
may
when
he
began
serving
a
three-year
sentence
for
campaign
finance
violations
and
fraud
one
of
the
topics
the
pair
bonded
over
is
their
feelings
about
their
old
boss
the
source
said
newman
is
helping
him
get
through
this
since
they
share
a
common
disdain
for
the
president
it
is
unclear
what
date
newman
visited
but
our
source
said
it
was
sometime
around
late
june
since
only
family
members
were
allowed
immediate
visits
it
takes
time
for
visitors
who
aren't
relatives
to
be
approved
the
source
added
the
former
white
house
aide
and
communications
official
was
not
dressed
in
business
attire
during
her
visit
but
more
dress-up
casual
the
source
told
us
newman's
presence
created
a
buzz
within
the
facility
and
more
security
was
added
as
a
result
one
of
the
first
days
that
michael
cohen
was
at
otisville
the
whole
entire
prison
was
on
lockdown
for
a
few
hours
because
of
a
drone
that
was
flying
over
the
grounds
taking
photos
the
source
added
however
cohen
has
managed
to
keep
a
lower
profile
recently
and
comes
across
as
a
family
man
according
to
our
source
michael
stays
busy
playing
tennis
and
just
biding
his
time
the
source
said
newman's
friendship
with
cohen
may
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
public
since
she
defended
the
disgraced
lawyer's
credibility
while
he
was
on
trial
according
to
an
msnbc
interview
that
aired
in
august
the
former
white
house
staffer
stated
she
knew
cohen
for
over
a
decade
since
he
worked
closely
with
trump
when
she
was
a
contestant
on
the
first
season
of
the
apprentice
in
he's
credible
because
donald
trump
trusted
him
with
his
most
intimate
projects
she
said
on
msnbc
live
with
hallie
jackson
it's
really
difficult
for
me
to
watch
people
try
to
demonize
michael
cohen
when
he
was
just
doing
what
he
was
told
newman
herself
now
has
a
strained
relationship
with
trump
she
was
fired
from
the
white
house
in
december
and
allegedly
physically
dragged
omarosa
manigault
newman
since
her
departure
she
wrote
unhinged
which
is
deeply
critical
of
the
president
and
his
administration
and
released
tapes
of
her
encounters
with
white
house
officials
she
also
vowed
to
never
vote
for
trump
in
a
presidential
election
again
in
june
the
justice
department
sued
newman
for
allegedly
failing
to
file
a
required
financial
disclosure
report
in
click

to
get
the
fox

app
the
trump
campaign
also
filed
a
complaint
against
her
in
august
claiming
she
should
be
fined
millions
for
breaching
her
confidentiality
agreement
in
order
to
write
her
tell-all
book
in
response
to
her
prison
visit
newman

her
attorney
john
m.
phillips
told
us
we
are
in
the
process
of
naming
and
interviewing
witnesses
in
her
cases
and
would
expect
michael
cohen
to
be
one

for

denies
that
omarosa
ever
visited
him
