a
wsj
nbc
news
poll
out
today
certainly
shows
how
well
warren
has
been
doing
climbing
from
percent
in
july
to
percent
today
that's
as
impressively
good
as
kamala
harris
decline
from
percent
to
percent
is
impressively
bad
but
the
real
story
in
the
poll
is
that
the
frontrunner
biden
actually
managed
to
increase
his
vote
share
after
what
was
said
to
be
a
very
bad
summer
for
him
biden's
lift
was
as
large
as
warren's
climbing
from
percent
to
percent
then
why
are
we
reading
about
biden's
being
the
third
most
likely
candidate
to
win
the
nomination
behind
even
bernie
sanders
who
couldn't
even
get
the
job
done
in
a
solo
match
four
years
ago
against
the
weakest
democratic
nominee
since
michael
dukakis
much
as
political
analysts
did
in
with
donald
trump
and
the
republican
nod
they
are
now
working
under
the
assumption
that
biden
cannot
win
rather
than
paying
attention
to
the
performance
of
the
front
runner
their
gaze
is
fixed
on
incremental
changes
among
those
chasing
him
this
is
silly
for
a
couple
of
reasons
first
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
claim
now
we
tend
to
think
that
political
analysis
these
days
is
overly
dependent
on
data
but
we
would
like
to
see
at
least
some
facts
to
support
the
supposed
impossibility
of
biden's
victory
each
week
we
are
told
biden
was
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
but
each
week
all
he
does
is
sail
on
under
sunny
skies
second
even
if
we
were
to
grant
the
assumption
that
biden
was
ultimately
doomed
how
would
we
then
suppose
that
the
rest
of
the
field
would
remain
static
in
the
wake
of
such
a
catastrophic
failure
there
are
lots
of
reasons
that
people
support
biden
we
are
sure
but
we
are
equally
sure
that
many
of
his
backers
are
doing
so
in
an
effort
to
block
sanders
and
warren
from
the
nomination
the
perceived
danger
of
running
a
radically
liberal
candidate
is
widespread
among
democrats
biden
is
not
beto
o'rourke
if
the
year-old
former
vice
president
now
in
his
third
presidential
campaign
really
does
start
to
slip
in
the
polls
and
finds
himself
trailing
warren
it's
not
plausible
to
think
that
he
like
o'rourke
would
drag
on
in
some
kind
of
zombie
effort
his
key
backers
would
abandon
him
and
his
loved
ones
would
lean
hard
on
the
idea
of
getting
out
with
his
dignity
intact
so
where
would
all
of
that
support
go
not
to
warren
and
certainly
not
to
sanders
that's
why
candidates
like
amy
klobuchar
cory
booker
and
pete
buttigieg
are
hanging
around
like
the
little
mammals
who
thrived
after
the
meteor
strike
wiped
out
the
dinosaurs
they
too
could
find
advantages
in
the
demise
of
their
ecosystem's
megafauna
as
has
been
our
urging
all
along
we
would
only
remind
race
watchers
to
be
circumspect
about
how
future
events
will
unfold
it's
true
that
biden
may
not
go
the
distance
but
for
now
he
has
more
than
proven
himself
as
a
durable
frontrunner
it's
fun
to
imagine
what
might
happen
in
the
future
but
it
is
only
that
imagining
the
rulebook
it
takes
two
keys
to
launch
it
must
indeed
be
clear
to
a
demonstration
that
the
joint
possession
of
the
power
in
question
by
the
president
and
senate
would
afford
a
greater
prospect
of
security
than
the
separate
possession
of
it
by
either
of
them

is
bogged
down
by
disorganization
personality
clashes
and
poor

between

after
a

of

to
elizabeth

a
day
later
sanders
allies
and
former

are
worried
that
recent
disappointments
are
not
one-off
stumbles
but
rather
emblematic
of
larger
problems
in
his
bid
for
the
white

the
concerns
are

acute

finally
this

the
democrats
who
have
long
tried
to

trump's
bigger-is-better

offered
a
