a
republican
state
senator
in
virginia
changed
a
facebook
campaign
ad
friday
after
her
democratic
challenger
called
the
pro-second
amendment
post
violent
rhetoric
according
to
a
report
state
sen
amanda
chase's
original
ad
showed
her
at
a
gun
range
and
read
i'm
not
afraid
to
shoot
down
gun
groups
prompting
her
opponent
amanda
pohl
to
call
for
an
apology
the
richmond
times-dispatch
reported
this
kind
of
rhetoric
and
threats
towards
those
you
disagree
with
from
my
opponent
is
disturbing
pohl
wrote
on
twitter
on
friday
i'm
ready
to
listen
to
everyone
in
our
community
and
work
for
real
solutions
to
the
challenges
we
face

texas
state
lawmaker
tells
beto
o'rourke
after
dem
calls
his
twitter
message
a
death
threat
shortly
thereafter
chase's
campaign
changed
the
facebook
message
to
i'm
not
afraid
to
shoot
down
attacks
from
any
anti-gun
groups
because
gun
rights
are
women's
rights
the
chase
camp
said
the
original
wording
was
a
communications
oversight
according
to
the
times-dispatch
mistake
or
not
it's
still
violent
rhetoric
that
has
to
be
addressed
pohl
said
while
senator
chase
might
not
agree
with
me
and
other
activists
who
want
to
prevent
gun
violence
in
our
communities
she
at
the
very
least
needs
to
listen
to
our
concerns
and
not
take
out
campaign
ads
threatening
to
shoot
us
chase
is
an
unapologetic
gun
rights
advocate
who
gained
notoriety
earlier
this
year
for
openly
carrying
a
caliber
revolver
onto
the
senate
floor
in
richmond
saying
she
was
concerned
about
possible
violence
from
protesters
at
the
statehouse
unfortunately
in
the
general
assembly
we
see
the
good
we
see
the
bad
we
see
all
types
of
things
she
told
the
times-dispatch
it's
just
for
personal
safety
quite
honestly

the

described
openly
carrying
guns
as
empowering
women
and
even
likened
it
to
her
own
equal
rights
amendment
chase
is
running
for
a
second
term
