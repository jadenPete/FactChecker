the

willingness
to
seize
on
completely
uncorroborated

the

also
stated
that
well
before

became
a
federal

at
least
seven
people
had
heard
about
how
he
allegedly
exposed
himself
to
deborah
ramirez
at
a
party
ramirez
had
called
classmates
at
yale
seeking
corroboration
for
her
story
and
even
told
some
of
her
classmates
that
she
could
not
remember
the
culprit
in
the
alleged
episode
before
changing
her
mind
and
publicly
blaming
kavanaugh
after
six
days
of
carefully
assessing
her
memories
and
consulting
with
her
attorney

reported
last

in

seven

that

produced
nothing
in

they
also
declined

for

to

investigators
or
to
provide

additionally
the

separately
reached
out
to
nearly
a
dozen
individuals
to
corroborate
the
allegations
by

and
ramirez
and
ultimately
spoke
to
ten
individuals

apparently
found
no

delay
in

hearings
so
an

said
the

limited
in
length
to
avoid
derailing
the

with
endless
claims

probes
going

to
kavanaugh's
high
school
years

by

during
his
confirmation
process
to
be
a
hardline
conservative
often
sided
with
liberal
justices
during
the
supreme
court's
last
term
the
president
meanwhile
accused
the
media
of
trying
to
influence
kavanaugh
he
also
went
on
to
say
that
kavanaugh
should
go
on
the
offensive
and
take
on
the
media
for
false
statements
brett
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the
lies
being
told
about
him
are
unbelievable
false
accusations
without
recrimination
when
does
it
stop
they
are
trying
to
influence
his
opinions
can't
let
that
happen
he
tweeted
grassley
sent
several
criminal
referrals
to
the
justice
department
related
to
alleged
lies
submitted
to
senate
investigators
during
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
which
could
be
what
the
president
meant
when
he
wrote
sunday
that
the
doj
should
come
to
kavanuagh's
rescue
one
of
those
referrals
was
for
now-disgraced
attorney
michael
avenatti
and
one
of
his
clients
julie
swetnick
regarding
a
potential
conspiracy
to
provide
false
statements
to
congress
and
obstruct
its
investigation
swetnick's
credibility
took
a
hit
as
she
changed
her
story
about
kavanaugh's
purported
gang-rape
trains
and
her
ex-boyfriend
went
public
to
say
she
was
known
for
exaggerating
everything
swetnick
and
ramirez
were
just
two
of
several
women
who
had
accused
kavanaugh
of
sexual
misconduct
during
his
confirmation
process
ford
most
notably
testified
that
kavanaugh
attempted
to
sexually
assault
her
at
a
party
when
they
were
teens
and
dubiously
asserted
that
the
memory
was
indelible
in
her
hippocampus
although
no
witnesses
could
corroborate
her
ever-changing
story
even
her
close
lifelong
friend

ford
said
had
attended
the
party
keyser
according
to

not
believe
ford's
story
and
refused
to
change
her
mind
despite
pressure
from
progressive
activists
and
ford's
friends
it
just
didn't
make
any
sense
keyser
said
referring
to
ford's
explanation
of
how
she
was
assaulted
at
a
party
that
keyser
attended
but
could
not
recall
how
she
got
home
ford's
attorney
debra
katz
was
quoted
in
a
new
book
as
saying
that
ford
was
motivated
to
come
forward
in
part
by
a
desire
to
tag
kavanaugh's
reputation
with
an
asterisk
before
he
could
start
ruling
on
abortion-related
cases
in
the
aftermath
of
these
hearings
i
believe
that
christine's
testimony
brought
about
more
good
than
the
harm
misogynist
republicans
caused
by
allowing
kavanaugh
on
the
court
katz
said
he
will
always
have
an
asterisk
next
to
his
name
when
he
takes
a
scalpel
to

it
