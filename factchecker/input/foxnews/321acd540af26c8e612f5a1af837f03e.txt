ramirez
was
one
of
several
women
who
had
accused
kavanaugh
of
sexual
misconduct
during
his
confirmation
process
dr
christine
blasey
ford
testified
that
kavanaugh
attempted
to
sexually
assault
her
at
a
party
when
they
were
teens
her
attorney
debra
katz
was
quoted
in
a
new
book
as
saying
that
ford
was
motivated
to
come
forward
in
part
by
a
desire
to
tag
kavanaugh's
reputation
with
an
asterisk
before
he
could
start
ruling
on
abortion-related
cases
in
the
aftermath
of
these
hearings
i
believe
that
christine's
testimony
brought
about
more
good
than
the
harm
misogynist
republicans
caused
by
allowing
kavanaugh
on
the
court
katz
said
he
will
always
have
an
asterisk
next
to
his
name
when
he
takes
a
scalpel
to
roe
v
wade
we
will
know
who
he
is
we
know
his
character
and
we
know
what
motivates
him
