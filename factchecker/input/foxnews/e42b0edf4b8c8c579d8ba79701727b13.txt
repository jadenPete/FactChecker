greg
palkot
reports
from
london
i
don't
claim
to
be
an
expert
on
parliamentary
procedure
and
precedence
in
the
british
house
of
commons
but
i
can
say
one
thing
congress
would
sure
be
a
helluva
lot
more
fun
if
the
u.s.
adopted
a
couple
of
parliament's
traditions
here
upheaval
in
parliament
commanded
global
headlines
the
past
few
weeks
as
it
wrestles
with
brexit
arguably
the
greatest
existential
threat
to
the
united
kingdom
since
world
war
ii
british
prime
minister
boris
johnson
fought
with
fellow
conservatives
and
even
banished
a
few
from
parliament
including
winston
churchill's
grandson
retiring
speaker
jon
bercow
has
emerged
as
an
internet
sensation
i
mean
could
you
imagine
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-ca
bickering
with
her
members
the
way
bercow
does
one
wonders
if
pelosi
could
verbally
incinerate
a
heckling
backbencher
with
a
rhetorical
projectile
worthy
of
bercow's
sermons
i'm
not
remotely
interested
in
your
pettifogging
objections
sneered
bercow
from
the
speaker's
chair
at
one
member
of
parliament
mp
i
don't
give
a
flying
flamingo
to
the
uninitiated
pettifogging
is
the
act
of
placing
undue
emphasis
on
picayune
details
and
for
the
record
flamingos
usually
only
fly
at
night
one
also
can't
envision
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
telling
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-ny
he
doesn't
give
a
flying
flamingo
about
his
views
on
legislation
that
said
schumer
did
exclaim
shame
shame
on
him
the
other
day
regarding
mcconnell
this
came
after
mcconnell
characterized
a
democratic
press
conference
on
gun
violence
with
dayton
oh
mayor
nan
whaley
d
as
theatrics
however
the
democratic
party
ought
to
tell
its
presidential
contenders
that
the
first
candidate
to
dispatch
one
of
their
rivals
with
the
flying
flamingo
retort
at
the
next
debate
will
claim
the
nomination
by
acclamation
the
british
house
of
commons
like
most
parliamentary
assemblies
around
the
world
have
a
mace
the
mace
is
essentially
a
physical
symbol
of
the
power
of
each
legislative
body
in
ancient
rome
the
mace
was
a
battle
weapon
in
the
case
of
great
britain
the
mace
is
a
five-foot
silver
rod
festooned
with
roses
and
stems
winding
around
a
crown
at
the
top
it's
believed
the
british
mace
dates
back
to
king
charles
ii
and
the
th
century
there
was
a
dramatic
moment
late
last
year
when
one
mp
swiped
the
mace
from
its
resting
space
in
the
chamber
in
an
act
of
protest
and
bolted
for
the
exit
order
put
it
back
no
no
admonished
bercow
the
house
of
representatives
also
has
a
mace
kept
in
the
office
of
sergeant
at
arms
paul
irving
it's
nearly
four
feet
tall
and
bound
with
silver
strands
only
house
officials
ever
handle
the
mace
and
then
with
white
gloves
to
protect
its
integrity
house
officials
always
escort
the
mace
into
the
dais
in
the
chamber
when
the
body
meets
each
day
but
its
not
unheard
of
for
the
house
to
present
the
mace
in
front
of
a
member
if
they
get
out
of
line
the
last
known
instance
came
in
house
officials
nearly
brandished
the
mace
in
front
of
rep
maxine
waters
d-ca
after
a
verbal
altercation
on
the
floor
one
wonders
if
a
house
member
here
might
ever
consider
trying
to
abscond
with
the
mace
the
way
the
labour
mp
did
some
months
ago
it
might
not
do
much
for
parliamentary
decorum
but
it
would
certainly
stir
a
fuss
in
congress
nothing
against
the
mace
in
the
house
of
representatives
but
the
house
might
consider
upping
its
mace
game
and
follow
the
lead
of
two
canadian
maces
we're
not
even
talking
about
a
mace
in
ottawa
try
iqaluit
nunavut
the
most
northerly
territory
in
canada
and
edmonton
the
provincial
capital
of
alberta
the
mace
for
the
legislative
assembly
in
nunavut
features
a
typical
crown
on
the
top
to
respect
the
british
monarch
a
two-and-a-quarter
carat
diamond
and
even
an
insignia
reminiscent
of
a
fleur-de-lis
but
the
body
of
the
mace
is
covered
with
narwhal
tusk
jutting
out
from
the
sides
like
a
weapon
straight
out
of
game
of
thrones
the
original
mace
in
alberta
was
a
real
piece
of
work
and
an
afterthought
when
alberta
became
a
province
in
the
assembly
realized
it
lacked
a
mace
so
they
scrambled
together
to
construct
a
homemade
mace
officials
taped
together
a
plumbing
pipe
brass
knobs
from
a
bed
the
handle
of
a
shaving
mug
and
to
top
it
all
off
the
round
float
from
a
toilet
tank
alberta
used
that
mace
for
decades
but
without
question
the
most
fascinating
tradition
in
the
british
parliament
which
congress
should
appropriate
is
the
role
of
the
black
rod
yes
there
is
an
official
from
the
house
of
lords
actually
called
the
black
rod
the
black
rod
sounds
like
an
archvillain
from
the
avengers
think
the
green
goblin
or
the
red
skull
perhaps
natasha
romanov
can
get
involved
somehow
after
all
she's
the
black
widow
anyway
the
black
rod
is
kind
of
an
usher
who
dresses
like
the
character
on
a
bottle
of
johnnie
walker
scotch
kind
of
a
british
version
of
colonel
sanders
the
black
rod
carries
surprise
a
rod
when
parliament
meets
mp's
deliberately
slam
the
door
in
the
face
of
the
black
rod
he
or
she
then
knocks
three
times
on
the
parliament
door
for
admission
mp's
shut
the
door
to
symbolize
an
independence
of
parliament
from
the
monarch
and
when
parliament
ceases
to
meet
the
black
rod
appears
in
the
chamber
to
escort
the
the
speaker
out
of
the
chamber
sarah
clarke
currently
serves
as
the
black
rod
bercow
didn't
initially
accompany
clarke
out
of
the
chamber
this
time
considering
the
strife
in
parliament
and
the
imbroglio
over
brexit
but
after
firing
off
a
few
snide
remarks
from
the
speaker's
chair
bercow
finally
stood
down
and
parliament
was
finished
for
a
few
weeks
no
one
could
imagine
a
black
rod
in
the
u.s.
house
escorting
pelosi
anywhere
for
the
record
when
congress
finishes
its
session
it's
said
the
house
and
senate
adjourn
sine
die
that's
latin
for
without
a
future
date
it's
pronounced
sigh-nee-dy
when
parliament
adjourns
such
is
the
case
now
it's
called
prorogation
that's
alright
it's
just
as
hard
to
pronounce
as
sine
die
get
the
fox
news
app
adopting
a
few
customs
from
other
parliamentary
systems
would
certainly
make
congress
a
little
more
intriguing
debate
on
the
house
and
senate
floor
is
sometimes
rather
stale
dialing
things
up
a
notch
or
two
in
the
bercow
model
would
at
least
make
it
more
amusing
and
if
you
don't
like
the
suggestions
i
don't
give
a
flying
flamingo
