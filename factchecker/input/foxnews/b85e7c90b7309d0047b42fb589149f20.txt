president
trump's
campaign
team
thinks
he
has
a
shot
at
winning
new
mexico
with
a
message
on
immigration
and
trade
at
a
rally
in
rio
rancho
on
monday
the
president
hammered
home
the
point
that
his
administration
has
done
more
to
reverse
what
he
called
calamitous
trade
policies
than
any
other
administration
in
history
your
state
lost
percent
of
its
manufacturing
jobs
after
nafta
was
signed
trump
told
the
crowd
on
monday
this
was
one
of
the
great
catastrophes
and
now
we're
replacing
nafta
with
the
brand
new
u.s.
mexico
canada
agreement
usmca
new
mexico's
economy
has
depended
heavily
on
the
energy
sector
and
has
experienced
a
boom
in
recent
months
this
year
state
lawmakers
already
have
been
revising
the
budget
to
factor
in
the
additional
resources
according
to
a
recent
associated
press
report
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
trump
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
said
data
points
like
this
were
part
of
what
brought
new
mexico
to
his
attention
the
chinese
tariff
fight
is
bringing
jobs
back
here
and
oil
and
gas
industry
exploding
parscale
said
he
spoke
to
fox
news
before
a
vamos
to
victory
latino
outreach
event
in
los
ranchos
de
albuquerque
in
new
mexico
one
of
many
they've
planned
to
hold
in
the
months
ahead
but
why
come
to
a
state
the
president
lost
by
eight
points
just
four
years
ago
that
answer
may
be
found
in
the
el
paso
texas
rally
the
team
hosted
earlier
this
year
at
the
el
paso
rally
we
noticed
that
a
significant
number
of
those
who
were
registering
were
actually
new
mexico
voters
trump
campaign
press
secretary
kayleigh
mcenany
said
we
saw
percent
of
the
registrants
were
democrats
and
percent
were
swing
voters
that's
percent
who
were
not
republican
several
of
those
in
line
at
the
rally
in
rio
rancho
said
they
saw
themselves
as
the
silent
majority
in
new
mexico
whom
republicans
finally
have
been
recognizing
they
pointed
to
trade
the
economy
and
the
border
wall
as
reasons
they've
remained
loyal
to
the
president
the
immigration
right
is
now
flooding
new
mexico
one
woman
from
rio
rancho
said
i
work
in
the
medical
field
so
i
see
it
everywhere
a
lot
of
us
new
mexicans
who
need
the
help
are
getting
turned
down
cause
the
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere
trump
demands
resignations
at
ny
times
during
new
mexico
rally
mcenany
said
trump's
immigration
policy
has
been
one
of
the
biggest
misunderstandings
of
the
hispanic
electorate
it
is
a
complete
falsehood
to
suggest
that
hispanic
voters
do
not
care
about
immigration
she
said
on
the
contrary
latino
voters
care
about
border
security
many
democrats
however
rejected
this
notion
wholeheartedly
calling
trump's
rhetoric
on
immigrants
hateful
and
toxic
just
last
year
new
mexico
latinos
rejected
trump's
toxic
agenda
and
broken
promises
by
helping
elect
democrats
up
and
down
the
ballot
in
this
state
they
see
right
through
his
weak
attempt
to
court
our
community
and
are
not
buying
it
said
democratic
national
committee
dnc
director
of
hispanic
media
enrique
guti
rrez
there
is
no
doubt
the
president
and
his
team
have
an
uphill
climb
in
the
west
democrats
flipped
new
mexico's
only
red
house
seat
in
and
took
the
governor's
mansion
democrats
said
this
trend
will
only
continue
in
the
upcoming
election
and
the
fact
that
trump
thought
he
could
win
here
showed
the
team's
desperation
we
take
nothing
for
granted
dnc
battleground
state
communications
director
david
bergstein
said
but
this
gop
strategy
looks
like
they're
concerned
about
a
realistic
pathway
to
electoral
votes
at
the
moment
democrats
apparently
have
been
winning
the
battle
for
hispanic
voters
according
to
a
pew
research
center
report
an
estimated
percent
of
hispanic
voters
voted
for
a
democrat
in
compared
to
percent
who
voted
for
a
republican
still
it's
not
a
group
either
party
could
afford
to
forfeit
hispanics
have
been
on
track
to
be
the
largest
voting
minority
group
in
with
an
estimated
million
eligible
to
vote
in
according
to
pew
as
many
as
percent
of
voters
this
coming
cycle
are
expected
to
have
been
born
outside
the
u.s.
