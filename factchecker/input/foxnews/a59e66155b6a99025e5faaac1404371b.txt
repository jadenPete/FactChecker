d-n

would

mean
he

in
eating
a

diet
asked
during

debate
by

to
translate
that
into
spanish
no
the

playfully
added
eliciting

turning
serious
booker
added
that

hurting
our

ramos
had
cited
experts
who've
said
eating
less
meat
would
help
the
environment
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
in
february
days
after
he
launched
his
presidential
campaign
booker
said
i
think
that
whatever
you
eat
is
a
very
personal
decision
and
everybody
should
what
eat
what
they
want
to
eat
that's
america
that's
freedom
the
last
thing
we
want
is
the
government
telling
us
what
to
eat
the
latest
from
fox
news
on
the
presidential
debates
but
while
booker
isn't
calling
for
an
end
to
meat
consumption
he
is
pushing
for
a
moratorium
on
major
factory
farming
mergers
the
senator
told
fox
news
in
that
february
interview
that
massive
corporate
companies
are
coming
in
here
and
polluting
our
water
and
creating
unsustainable
practices
and
booker
who's
been
a
vegan
for
five
years
has
also
warned
that
the
planet's
climate
can't
survive
the
continuation
of
industrialized
animal
agriculture
