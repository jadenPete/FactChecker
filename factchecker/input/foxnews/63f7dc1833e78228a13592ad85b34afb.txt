trump
rep
tom
mcclintock
of

took
issue
with
house
democrats
who
took
a
big
step
in
their
impeachment
push
as
they
set
the
ground
rules
for
a

impeachment
hearings
while
the

is
not
writing
articles
of
impeachment
and
nothing
is
going
to
the
floor
of
the

right
now

said
the

engaged
in
an
investigation
as
to
whether
to
launch
an

trump
mcclintock
was
apparently
fed
up
with
democrats
seemingly
dancing
around
the
issue
of
whether
to
actually
pursue
impeachment
arguing
that
they
want
the
illusion
of
impeachment
without
the
reality

agenda
as
president
dismisses

complaint
if
the
majority
wants
to
exercise
the
house's
power
of
impeachment
all
you
got
to
do
is
ask
the
house
to
do
so
mcclintock
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
ask
the
house
that
it
direct
and
authorize
this
committee
to
conduct
an
impeachment
inquiry
that's
all
you
have
to
do
resolve
that
the
house
authorizes
the
judiciary
committee
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
the
impeachment
of
the
president
it's
that
simple
i
dare
you
to
do
it
in
fact
i
double
dog
dare
you
to
do
it
have
the
house
vote
on
those
words
and
then
go
at
it
why
won't
you
do
that
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
has
long
expressed
her
skepticism
about
impeachment
urging
democrats
to
zero
in
on
issues
such

asked
by
fox

on
monday
if
she
supported
nadler
pelosi
said
yes
i
do
i
think
you
should
characterize
it
for
what
it
is
it's
a
continuation
of
what
we
have
been
doing
she
said
you
know
we
all
work
together
on
these
things

the
middle
i
think
this
is
bad
politics
for
democrats
she
said
arguing
that
many
americans
have
a
general
fatigue
with
