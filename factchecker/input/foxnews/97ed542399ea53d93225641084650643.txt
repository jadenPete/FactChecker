greta
thunberg
appeared
before
members
of
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
wednesday
to
answer
questions
about
climate
change
but
made
it
clear
that
she
is
not
the
one
lawmakers
should
be
listening
to
instead
of
delivering
an
impassioned
address
she
opted
to
let
scientific
research
do
the
talking
in
the
form
of
a
report
from
the
intergovernmental
panel
on

thunberg
said
at
a
joint
hearing
held
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
and
the
house
select
committee
on
the
climate
crisis
the
report
warns
of
the
dangers
the
earth
would
face
if
global
warming
rose
to
degrees
celsius
above
pre-industrial
levels
and
called
for
efforts
to
keep
warming
no
more
than
degrees
higher
it
says
that
it
is
likely
defined
in
the
report
as
between
a
percent
and
chance
that
warming
could
reach
degrees
higher
than
pre-industrial
levels
some
time
between
and
if
increases
continue
at
the
present
rate

activities
are

thunberg
who
is
swedish
kept
her
remarks
brief
during
the
hearing
while
other
young
activists
delivered
impassioned
pleas
before
congress
she
made
concise
points
climate
crisis
committee
chairwoman
kathy
castor
d-fla
raised
the
argument
mentioned
earlier
by
rep
garret
graves
r-la
that
the
problem
was
not
u.s.
performance
when
it
comes
to
harmful
emissions
but
bad
actors
like
china
who
are
not
doing
enough
thunberg
said
this
argument
works
both
ways
another
perspective
she
offered
i
am
from
sweden
a
small
country
and
there
it
is
the
same
argument
why
should
we
do
anything
just
look
at
the
u.s.
they
say
just
so
you
know
that
is
being
used
against
you

well

thunberg
also
testified
tuesday
before
a
senate
climate
crisis
task
force
meeting
where
she
was
also
strictly
business
after
lawmakers
lauded
her
and
other
young
activists
she
reminded
them
that
she
was
not
there
for
compliments
please
save
your
praise
we
don't
want
it
she
said
don't
invite
us
here
to
just
tell
us
how
inspiring
we
are
without
actually
doing
anything
about
it
because
it
doesn't
lead
to
anything
thunberg
suggested
that
congress
invite
experts
to
testify
instead
if
you
want
advice
for
what
you
should
do
invite
scientists
ask
scientists
for
their
expertise
we
don't
want
to
be
heard
she
said
we
want
the
science
to
be
heard
