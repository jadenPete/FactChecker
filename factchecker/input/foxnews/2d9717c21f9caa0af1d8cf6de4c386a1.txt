down
the
process

the
justice
department
in
new
court
filings
sought
to
block
congressional
democrats
bid
for
secret
grand
jury
material
from
the
robert
mueller
investigation
by
citing
the
confusion
inside
the
caucus
over
whether
or
not
they're
pursuing
an
impeachment
investigation
in
the
friday
court
filing
the
doj
argued
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
clearly
is
not
house
dems
move
on
impeachment
the
committee's
own
description
of
its
investigation
makes
clear
that
it
is
too
far
removed
from
any
potential
judicial
proceeding
to
qualify
the
doj
said
after
muddled
messaging
on
the
matter
committee
democrats
last
week
argued
that
they
are
leading
an
impeachment
investigation
as
the
panel
took
its
first
formal
vote
establishing
the
procedures
for
those
proceedings
and
hearings
the
lawmakers
in
a
related
case
in
court
are
seeking
the
release
of
secret
grand
jury
material
from
mueller's
investigation
a
small
percentage
of
the
report
remains
redacted
as
grand
jury
material
must
remain
secret
according
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
with
narrow
exceptions
but
in
a
recent
court
filing
the
committee
claimed
their
investigation
of
trump's
possible
wrongdoing
falls
under
the
exception
for
judicial
proceedings
including
impeachment
proceedings
but
the
doj
countered
that
what
democrats
are
doing
is
hardly
such
an
investigation
kavanaugh
must
be
impeached
top
dems
say
as
uncorroborated
allegation
resurfaces
the
doj
also
quoted
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
d-n
y.
as
once
saying
a
n
impeachment
inquiry
is
when
you
consider
only
impeachment
that's
not
what
we're
doing
since
then
nadler
has
gone
back
and
forth
over
whether
or
not
his
committee's
investigation
is
indeed
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
developments
come
as
president
trump
on
monday
accused
the
committee
of
botching
their
efforts
he
then
referred
them
to
former
president
barack
obama
and
former
first
lady
michelle
obama's
deal
with
netflix
and
the
obamas
book
deal
from
as
well
as
other
deals
made
by
lawmakers
mccarthy
promises
accountability
as
barr
reviews
ig's
fisa
report
the
closest
we've
ever
seen
to
a
coup
house
judiciary
has
given
up
on
the
mueller
report
sadly
for
them
after
two
years
and
spent
zero
collusion
zero
obstruction
so
they
say
ok
lets
look
at
everything
else
and
all
of
the
deals
that
trump
has
done
over
his
lifetime
but
it
doesn't
work
that
way
trump
tweeted
monday
i
have
a
better
idea
look
at
the
obama
book
deal
or
the
ridiculous
netflix
deal
then
look
at
all
the
deals
made
by
the
dems
in
congress
the
congressional
slush
fund
and
lastly
the
ig
reports
take
a
look
at
them
those
investigations
would
be
over
fast
the
ig
reports
include
recently
released
findings
that
former
fbi
director
james
comey
violated
policies
with
his
handling

of
a

efforts
another
report
expected
to
be
released
in
the
near
future
will
discuss
whether
the
fbi
acted
improperly
with

to
fisa
warrant
applications
to
conduct
surveillance
of
former
trump
campaign
adviser
carter

let's
look

one
they've
looked
into
everything
that
we've
done
they

made
let's
subpoena
all
of
his
records
the
president
did
not
elaborate
on
what
such
an

might
find
the
congressional

fund
trump
referred
to
is
a
