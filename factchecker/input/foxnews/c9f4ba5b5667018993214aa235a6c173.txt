last
night

trump
tweeted
last
tuesday
i
disagreed
strongly
with
many
of
his
suggestions
as
did
others
in
the
administration
and
therefore
i
asked
john
for
his
resignation
which

very
much
for

fevered
speculation
over
john
bolton's
replacement
as
national
security
adviser
bolton
swiftly
challenged
trump's
version
of
events
saying
he
offered
to
resign
the
two
had
well-known
disagreements
on
a
range
of
hot-button
national
security
issues
perhaps
most
significantly
on
plans
for
a
troop
drawdown
in
afghanistan
while
trump
announced
a
troop
increase
in
as
part
of
an
effort
to
break
the
stalemate
in
the
country
he
has
been
moving
toward
agreeing
to
a
phased
withdrawal
of
troops
some
u.s.
troops
have
remained
in
afghanistan
advising
and
assisting
afghan
forces
and
conducting
counterterrorism
operations
inside
the
administration
bolton
also
advocated
caution
on
trump's
strategy
with
north
korea
and
was
against
trump's
decision
last
year
to
pull
u.s.
troops
out
of
syria
bolton
also
led
a
quiet
effort
inside
the
administration
and
with
allies
abroad
to
convince
the
president
to
keep
u.s.
forces
in
syria
to
counter
isis
and
iranian
influence
