times
op-ed
earlier
this

that
he'd
become
convinced
in
the
months
and
years
following
the
election
that
the
president
was
not
a
good
leader
but
a
racial
arsonist
who
encourages
bigotry
and
xenophobia
i
wanted
to
apologize
for
the
role
i
played
in
helping
to
put
an
unfit
con
man
in
the
white
house
walsh
tweeted
following
the
op-ed's
publication
why
did
i
write
this
piece
two
reasons
first
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
donald
trump
is
unfit
to
be
president
and
he
must
be
challenged
in
the
republican
primary
and
second

walshfreedom
august
like
trump
walsh
has
also
been
accused
of
bigotry
and
xenophobia
in
he
claimed
former
president
barack
obama
hates
israel
because
he's
a
muslim
obama
is
a
protestant
christian
in
walsh
said
obama's
inexperience
as
a
presidential
candidate
was
given
a
pass
by
his
supporters
simply
because
he's
black
later
that
year
he
accused
musician
stevie
wonder
of
being
another
ungrateful
black
multi
millionaire
after
he
took
a
knee
on
stage
to
protest
police
brutality
he
also
attacked
the
parents
of
children
killed
in
the
sandy
hook
elementary
school
mass
shooting
vowed
to
grab
his
musket
if
trump
lost
the
election
and
threatened
war
on
obama
and
black
lives
matter
punks
after
the
ambush
of
police
officers
in
dallas
if
walsh
does
become
a
presidential
contender
he'd
face
an
uphill
battle
against
trump
who
boasts
ample
resources
and
whose
approval
rating
with
republican
voters
has
remained
consistently
high
when
asked
by
the
times
to
react
to
walsh's
potential
primary
challenge
tim
murtaugh
a
spokesman
for
trump's
reelection
campaign
responded
with
just
two
words
certain
failure
asked
on
thursday
whether
it's
worth
running
even
if
he
can't
win
walsh
said
yes
this
is
a
scary
time
he
told
cnn's
new
day
and
if
republicans
stay
silent
in
the
face
of
this
guy
i
don't
think
the
country
will
ever
forgive
the
republican
party
but
forget
about
the
republican
party
if
this
guy
gets
four
more
years
we're
in
real
real
trouble
it's
worth
doing
anything
you
can
do
to
try
to
stop
that
just
now
walshfreedom
