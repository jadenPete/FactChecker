forum
exposes
rifts
on
fracking
nuclear
power
and
the
filibuster
turns
out
there
would
be
plenty
for
the
democrats
to
debate
should
they
ever
get
the
chance
at
cnn's
seven-hour
marathon
climate
crisis
town
hall
wednesday
the
top
candidates
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
united
on
calls
to
recommit
to
the
paris
climate
accord
end
subsidies
to
oil
gas
and
coal
companies
and
halt
fossil
fuel
leasing
on
public
lands
but
fault
lines
opened
on
issues
like
the
future
of
fossil
fuels
fracking
nuclear
energy
and
the
senate
filibuster
suggesting
a
debate
on
these
differences
should
be
at
the
forefront
of
the
nomination
process
not
relegated
to
a
sidebar
on
fracking
sens
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
kamala
harris
d-calif
called
for
total
bans
on
the
natural
gas
extraction
process
while
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
made
vague
promises
to
review
the
safety
of
existing
wells
on
nuclear
power
businessman
andrew
yang
and
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
envisioned
a
new
age
of
reactors
while
others
lamented
radioactive
waste
dividing
lines
over
whether
to
end
the
filibuster
the
senate
procedure
some
fear
would
obstruct
the
passage
of
climate
legislation
also
became
clearer
as
harris
joined
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
in
denouncing
the
practice
and
sanders
held
up
an
obscure
budgetary
tool
to
get
around
the
issue
the
back-to-back
forums
which
went
until
midnight
highlighted
the
complexity
of
overhauling
the
entire
global
economy
and
added
heft
to
activists
calls
for
a
full-on
debate
on
the
climate
crisis
though
audience
questions
served
as
useful
proxies
for
the
candidates
differences
it's
difficult
to
imagine
most
voters
watching
the
full
slate
of
town
halls
and
analyzing
the
distinctions
juli
n
castro
the
former
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
dodged
a
question
about
banning
fracking
but
acknowledged
that
his
view
of
the
drilling
practice
had
changed
almost
a
decade
ago
we
had
been
saying
that
natural
gas
was
a
bridge
fuel
he
said
we're
coming
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
sanders
who
first
called
for
a
ban
on
fracking
during
the
presidential
campaign
repeated
his
call
earlier
in
the
day
but
faced
no
questions
on
the
issue
during
his
cnn
segment
harris
said
she'd
ban
fracking
on
public
lands
and
push
for
legislation
to
prohibit
the
drilling
nationwide
there's
no
question
i'm
in
favor
of
banning
fracking
she
said
the
more
avowedly
centrist
candidates
trod
a
middle
ground
both
biden
and
klobuchar
said
they
oppose
fracking
bans
but
promised
to
launch
exhaustive
reviews
of
the
thousands
of
existing
fracking
sites
to
determine
which
ones
were
safe
neither
offered
details
on
how
such
sweeping
assessments
would
be
conducted
by
when
or
by
whom
or
on
what
legal
grounds
their
administrations
would
revoke
existing
permits
no
one
seemed
more
enthusiastic
about
the
future
of
nuclear
power
than
yang
he
called
for
converting
existing
plants
from
uranium
to
thorium-based
reactors
which
produce
less
radioactive
waste
according
to
the
world
nuclear
association
to
me
nuclear
energy
needs
to
be
on
the
table
in
a
transition
to
a
more
renewable
economy
because
our
society
consumes
a
great
deal
of
energy
yang
said
and
nuclear
right
now
it
gets
a
bad
rap
in
part
because
the
technologies
we're
using
are
antiquated
booker
touted
his
massive
moonshot
proposal
on
climate
that
includes
research
and
investments
in
nuclear
energy
he
called
it
the
future
we
need
to
not
be
fearful
of
but
rather
that
we
need
to
embrace
we've
got
to
get
people
excited
about
what's
there
he
said
we
as
a
society
as
americans
must
make
the
investments
so
we
lead
humanity
to
the
innovations
the
breakthroughs
and
the
jobs
of
the
future
but
with
nuclear
waste
a
top
concern
in
the
early-voting
state
of
nevada
others
approached
the
energy
source
with
skepticism
sanders
said
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
me
to
add
more
dangerous
waste
to
this
country
and
to
the
world
when
we
don't
know
how
to
get
rid
of
what
we
have
right
now
we
got
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
nuclear
waste
sanders
said
which
as
you
know
is
going
to
stay
around
this
planet
for
many
many
many
thousands
of
years
and
you
know
what
we
don't
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
right
now
harris
vowed
never
to
force
states
to
take
nuclear
waste
the
biggest
issue
that
i
believe
we
face
in
terms
of
nuclear
energy
is
the
waste
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
that
she
said
washington
gov
jay
inslee
who
until
last
month
was
running
as
the
climate
candidate
in
the
race
helped
propel
calls
to
scrap
the
filibuster
to
the
forefront
of
the
national
debate
the
filibuster
is
the
biggest
hurdle
to
passing
a
comprehensive
climate
law
as
it
forces
a
vote
supermajority
to
end
senate
debate
and
allows
republicans
to
obstruct
any
major
legislative
progress
early
in
the
night
harris
made
news
by
saying
she'd
support
ending
the
filibuster
if
republicans
stood
in
the
way
of
a
green
new
deal
the
sweeping
industrial
plan
many
democrats
are
championing
to
zero
out
emissions
by
midcentury
as
president
of
the
united
states
i
am
prepared
to
get
rid
of
the
filibuster
to
pass
a
green
new
deal
she
said
in
making
the
announcement
she
joined
warren
so
far
the
only
other
major
candidate
to
support
ending
the
filibuster
but
doing
so
would
require
democrats
to
win
a
firm
majority
in
the
senate
a
prospect
that
is
far
from
guaranteed
sanders
instead
vowed
to
pass
climate
legislation
through
another
congressional
procedure
the
budget
reconciliation
act
the
procedure
as
vox's
david
roberts
described
it
in
a
helpful
explainer
allows
for
a
special
kind
of
bill
meant
to
reconcile
the
federal
budget
that
only
requires
a
majority
vote
in
the
senate
to
pass
sanders
noted
that
former
president
george
w.
bush
pushed
his
tax
cuts
on
the
wealthy
through
that
process
just
as
bush
got
through
major
tax
breaks
for
the
rich
through
the
budget
reconciliation
act
we
can
do
that
as
well
he
said
so
if
your
question
is
and
we're
going
to
need
votes
to
save
the
planet
the
answer
is
no
we
will
not
there
are
ways
there
are
ways
to
get
that
through
the
budget
reconciliation
act
which
will
require
votes
and
that's
the
method
we
will
use
there
were
other
firm
divisions
despite
showing
a
united
front
in
past
debates
on
health
care
warren
made
a
clear
distinction
between
herself
and
sanders
on
the
issue
of
public
ownership
of
utilities
sanders
sweeping
trillion
green
new
deal
calls
for
a
massive
expansion
of
federally
owned
electricity
generation
though
advisers
stressed
that
it's
a
public
option
not
a
complete
takeover
of
the
industry
if
somebody
wants
to
make
a
profit
from
building
better
solar
panels
and
generating
better
battery
storage
i'm
not
opposed
to
that
warren
said
what
i'm
opposed
to
is
when
they
do
it
in
a
way
that
hurts
everybody
else
