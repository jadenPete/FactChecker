businesses
are
finally
stepping
up
to
help
the
homeless
crisis
a
seattle
initiative

homeless
customers
with
charitable
businesses

rita
was
homeless
when
she
was
diagnosed
with
congestive
heart
failure
in
fortunately
medicaid
covered
her
prescription
costs
not
so
fortunately
her
medication
acted
as
a
diuretic
she
had
to
urinate
frequently
if
she
had
a
permanent
place
to
stay
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
problem
but
in
seattle
where
she
had
become
homeless
after
struggling
with
addiction
for
years
many
of
the
shelters
closed
every
morning
and
didn't
reopen
until
p
m
that
meant
rita
had
to
spend
most
of
her
day
looking
for
bathrooms
businesses
she
learned
were
out
of
the
question
rita
remembers
telling
a
restaurant
hostess
about
her
condition
and
begging
to
use
the
bathroom
the
hostess
refused
there
were
times
when
i
had
to
relieve
myself
in
parks
and
alleys
rita
said
there's
no
tissue
and
there's
no
privacy
it's
so
degrading
rita
eventually
got
into
recovery
and
found
a
subsidized
apartment
through
her
case
manager
she
found
a
plus-size
consignment
store
that
donated
clothes
to
women
who
were
experiencing
homelessness
or
had
just
escaped
it
she
took
the
bus
to
the
shop
and
picked
out
a
dress
a
blazer
and
a
purse
nice
clothes
the
kinds
of
things
you'd
find
at
nordstrom
or
macy's
she
said
she
went
back
to
the
same
restaurant
in
her
new
outfit
the
hostess
let
her
use
the
bathroom
with
no
hesitation
that
felt
good
but
it
also
felt
bad
said
rita
who
asked
huffpost
not
to
use
her
full
name
because
it
might
affect
her
ability
to
find
work
businesses
treat
you
so
terribly
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
as
a
person
it's
just
how
you
look
america's
homelessness
crisis
is
transforming
every
institution
of
urban
life
libraries
have
started
offering
showers
social
workers
and
even
nurses
to
their
homeless
patrons
transit
agencies
are
converting
subway
stations
into
makeshift
shelters
police
face
increasing
pressure
to
incorporate
counseling
harm
reduction
and
other
public
health
approaches
in
their
work
and
yet
businesses
have
mostly
escaped
scrutiny
for
the
ways
they
treat
people
experiencing
homelessness
last
october
two
dunkin
donuts
employees
were
fired
after
pouring
water
on
a
man
sleeping
outside
their
store
in
syracuse
new
york
other
retailers
use
spikes
music
and
even
robots
to
chase
away
homeless
people
despite
having
hundreds
of
locations
in
cities
with
high
homelessness
rates
starbucks
only
passed
a
policy
allowing
noncustomers
to
use
the
restroom
in
after
a
racist
incident
in
philadelphia
highlighted
the
chain's
lack
of
a
clear
policy
but
alongside
these
failures
are
signs
that
a
more
humane
approach
could
be
catching
on
as
homelessness
continues
to
increase
in
america's
fastest-growing
cities
companies
in
at
least
one
are
banding
together
to
help
in
most
places
the
private
sector's
primary
response
to
homelessness
has
been
trying
to
convince
cities
to
take
a
more
punitive
approach
to
solving
it
in
california
retailers
have
started
using
business
improvement
districts
to
pass
anti-panhandling
laws
that
have
been
shown
to
exacerbate
homelessness
and
have
already
been
struck
down
by
courts
municipal
chambers
of
commerce
have
funded
ballot
initiatives
supporting
police
sweeps
and
opposing
new
revenues
for
shelters
and
housing
in
seattle
local
businesses
funded
a
study
that
exaggerated
the
importance
of
the
homeless
population
in
the
city's
crime
rate
alongside
the
cruel
companies
are
the
clueless
ones
over
the
last
few
years
silicon
valley
startups
have
built
apps
that
make
it
easier
for
city
residents
to
report
tent
encampments
to
police
in
the
south
by
southwest
arts
festival
in
austin
texas
used
homeless
people
as
wi-fi
hot
spots
the
wealthy
working
people
have
earned
their
right
to
live
in
the
city
wrote
two-time
startup
founder
justin
keller
in
in
an
open
letter
to
the
mayor
of
san
francisco
i
shouldn't
have
to
see
the
pain
struggle
and
despair
of
homeless
people
to
and
from
my
way
to
work
every
day
these
attitudes
are
what
makes
living
on
the
streets
an
endless
experience
of
exclusion
you
want
to
know
what
it's
like
to
be
homeless
just
walk
around
all
day
said
tyrone
a
government
employee
in
washington
state
who
asked
huffpost
not
to
use
his
last
name
out
of
fear
that
it
could
jeopardize
his
employment
tyrone
spent
three
years
living
on
the
streets
in
georgia
he
once
had
to
walk
miles
to
a
hospital
to
get
water
on
a
degree
day
after
more
than
a
dozen
businesses
refused
to
let
him
through
their
doors
the
police
will
harass
you
if
you're
outside
he
said
and
businesses
will
harass
you
if
you
try
to
come
inside
but
not
every
business
is
so
hostile
lisa
michaud
the
owner
of
two
big
blondes
the
clothing
store
where
rita
picked
up
her
designer
outfit
has
been
working
with
service
providers
and
inviting
homeless
women
to
visit
her
store
for
years
we
know
it's
not
the
same
thing
as
solving
homelessness
michaud
said
but
it's
important
to
us
to
get
to
know
our
homeless
neighbors
and
offer
them
whatever
we
can
michaud's
store
is
a
neighborhood
institution
in
seattle's
rapidly
gentrifying
central
district
as
the
homeless
population
has
increased
around
her
in
the
last
five
years
michaud
has
deepened
her
relationships
with
local
service
providers
rita
still
comes
to
the
store
every
three
months
to
try
on
new
outfits
and
take
some
of
them
home
my
new
addiction
is
clothes
she
said
the
employees
at
the
store
help
her
pick
accessories
sometimes
they
have
brand-new
bras
and
underwear
to
offer
they
loved
me
when
i
didn't
love
myself
rita
said
two
big
blondes
is
part
of
a
seattle-based
initiative
called
the
pledge
in
which
companies
offer
services
such
as
bathroom
use
free
water
or
phone
charging
to
homeless
customers
pledge
organizers
then
add
the
company's
location
to
a
map
that
they
distribute
to
people
living
on
the
streets
and
the
businesses
can
add
a
sticker
to
their
door
we're
trying
to
kill
the
stereotype
that
there's
places
where
homeless
people
shouldn't
be
said
devin
silvernail
founder
and
director
of
the
pledge
silvernail's
inspiration
was
personal
he
grew
up
in
seattle
and
moved
to
san
francisco
for
college
when
he
returned
in
silvernail
couldn't
find
an
affordable
apartment
and
spent
months
sleeping
on
friends
couches
i
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
cafes
he
said
and
i
was
aware
that
i
could
do
that
because
i
look
and
dress
a
certain
way
it
was
easy
for
me
and
i
wanted
to
make
it
easy
for
everybody
silvernail
start
going
door
to
door
asking
businesses
if
they
would
consider
offering
services
to
homeless
customers
he
began
by
requesting
that
they
open
their
restrooms
but
most
retailers
refused
they
didn't
want
to
become
a
hub
for
homeless
residents
and
turn
other
customers
away
so
silvernail
scaled
back
he
began
asking
cafes
to
offer
free
water
and
bike
shops
to
let
their
homeless
neighbors
to
use
their
air
pumps
since
many
of
them
were
doing
that
anyway
they
agreed
soon
afterward
silvernail
found
most
of
them
started
allowing
homeless
people
to
use
their
restrooms
too
if
you
start
small
companies
will
realize
that
homeless
customers
aren't
so
different
from
everyone
else
silvernail
said
so
far
companies
have
signed
up
with
the
pledge
the
most
common
offerings
are
free
water
device
charging
and
restrooms
but
others
have
gone
a
step
further
a
barbershop
gives
out
free
haircuts
a
spa
lets
homeless
people
take
a
rest
a
thrift
store
funded
by
an
aids
charity
invites
homeless
customers
to
take
advantage
of
its
free
hiv
tests
cafes
have
started
to
step
up
too
some
offer
free
warm
drinks
during
the
winter
others
have
created
pay
it
forward
funds
that
their
customers
pay
into
and
homeless
people
can
draw
from
if
they
need
a
drink
or
a
snack
many
more
have
installed
needle
disposal
containers
in
their
restrooms
while
the
model
is
growing
in
seattle
and
silvernail
is
helping
other
cities
establish
similar
initiatives
he
acknowledges
that
it's
an
uphill
climb
lots
of
cafes
don't
want
to
be
included
on
publicly
available
maps
or
advertise
that
they
hand
out
pastries
at
the
end
of
the
day
there's
also
the
challenge
of
chain
stores
while
a
significant
percentage
of
baristas
and
store
managers
respond
positively
to
silvernail's
pitch
managers
and
owners
less
connected
to
daily
operations
are
often
skittish
about
publicly
welcoming
homeless
customers
the
higher
you
go
in
the
hierarchy
the
more
nervous
people
get
silvernail
said
one
seattle
coffee
chain
kaladi
brothers
coffee
pulled
out
of
the
pledge
in
reversing
the
decision
of
the
local
store
manager
in
a
statement
kaladi's
ceo
said
he
was
concerned
that
the
pledge
would
invite
drug
use
long
wait
times
for
the
bathrooms
and
homeless
people
shouting
profanity
at
customers
what
we
tell
businesses
is
that
you
don't
have
to
give
anyone
special
treatment
silvernail
said
if
someone
is
a
jerk
you
can
still
kick
them
out
while
some
homeless
customers
do
indeed
have
mental
health
or
drug
abuse
problems
the
majority
do
not
punishing
every
homeless
person
for
the
actions
of
a
few
individuals
silvernail
said
just
reinforces
the
stigmatization
of
poverty
he
set
up
the
pledge
to
address
but
the
more
fundamental
challenge
of
the
pledge
model
is
that
alleviating
the
daily
indignities
of
homelessness
is
not
the
same
as
solving
it
outright
as
the
pledge
spreads
to
other
cities
silvernail
hopes
it
will
encourage
businesses
to
take
a
more
humane
approach
in
their
lobbying
efforts
as
well
as
their
daily
operations
there's
a
vocal
minority
of
business
that
don't
want
to
help
but
a
much
greater
number
want
to
help
and
just
don't
know
how
he
said
