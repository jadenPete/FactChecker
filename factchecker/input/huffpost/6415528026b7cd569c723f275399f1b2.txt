ex-starbucks
ceo
howard
schultz
says
he
won't
run
for
president
in
democrats
warned
that
schultz's
plan
to
launch
an
independent
bid
could
have
helped
secure
trump's
reelection
former
starbucks
ceo
howard
schultz
has
announced
that
he
will
not
seek
the
presidency
after
months
of
consideration
my
belief
in
the
need
to
reform
our
two-party
system
has
not
wavered
but
i
have
concluded
that
an
independent
campaign
for
the
white
house
is
not
how
i
can
best
serve
our
country
at
this
time
schultz
wrote
in
a
letter
posted
to
his
website
on
friday
the
letter
will
be
sent
to
thousands
of
supporters
later
in
the
day
axios
reported
schultz
a
self-described
lifelong
democrat
had
discussed
a
potential
run
as
an
independent
in
january
suggesting
that
he
was
driven
by
the
reckless
failure
of
constitutional
responsibility
among
both
democrats
and
republicans
the
american
people
are
exhausted
their
trust
has
been
broken
and
they
are
looking
for
a
better
choice
he
said
in
a
cbs
interview
that
month
in
a
video
later
posted
to
twitter
schultz
said
he
would
be
traveling
around
the
country
in
the
following
weeks
to
speak
with
members
of
the
public
about
his
political
aspirations
he
ended
up
cutting
his
travels
short
however
after
experiencing
acute
back
pain
that
led
to
three
back
surgeries
he
said
in
an
email
to
his
supporters
in
mid-june
i
am
feeling
much
better
and
my
doctors
foresee
a
full
recovery
so
long
as
i
rest
and
rehabilitate
he
said
at
the
time
i
have
decided
to
take
the
summer
to
do
just
that
in
his
letter
friday
schultz
cited
his
lengthy
recovery
from
the
injury
as
a
reason
why
he
couldn't
engage
with
people
at
the
level
necessary
to
run
for
president
in
the
end
he
didn't
have
to
go
far
to
get
feedback
about
his
political
aspirations
the
news
in
january
that
schultz
was
considering
a
presidential
run
as
an
independent
ignited
a
wave
of
democratic
concern
that
such
a
bid
could
help
president
donald
trump
get
reelected
former
new
york
mayor
michael
bloomberg
who
also
considered
a
run
quickly
spoke
out
against
the
idea
of
a
third-party
candidate
arguing
that
person
would
just
split
the
anti-trump
vote
and
end
up
re-electing
the
president
democratic
presidential
candidate
juli
n
castro
who
served
as
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
under
president
barack
obama
offered
the
same
warning
telling
cnn
that
an
independent
run
by
schultz
would
provide
trump
with
his
best
hope
for
getting
reelected
former
obama
senior
adviser
david
axelrod
voiced
similar
concerns
on
twitter
calling
schultz's
idea
the
only
good
news
trump
received
that
week
schultz
seemed
to
have
considered
that
criticism
in
his
letter
exiting
the
race
saying
not
enough
people
will
consider
backing
an
independent
candidate
out
of
fear
that
it
will
help
trump
be
reelected
trump
appeared
to
try
to
goad
schultz
into
running
tweeting
that
the
businessman
doesn't
have
the
guts
to
be
president
schultz
stepped
down
as
ceo
of
starbucks
in
june
and
was
immediately
asked
by
reporters
about
any
white
house
ambitions
which
he
then
declined
to
rule
out
i
intend
to
think
about
a
range
of
options
and
that
could
include
public
service
he
told
the
new
york
times
at
the
time
but
i'm
a
long
way
from
making
any
decisions
about
the
future
schultz
said
friday
the
money
he
had
raised
for
the
campaign
will
be
used
to
invest
in
people
organizations
and
ideas
that
promote
honesty
civility
and
results
in
our
politics
