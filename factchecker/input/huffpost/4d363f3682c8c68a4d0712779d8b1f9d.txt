on

has
more
than
quintupled
down
on
his
baseless
claims
of
shady
voting
to
explain
why
he
lost
the
popular
vote
to
democrat
hillary
clinton
in
and
this
time
he
blamed
google

has
repeatedly
insisted
with
no
evidence
that
million
maybe
as
many
as
million
votes
were
illegally
cast
by
noncitizens
three
million
happens
to
be
close
to
clinton's
popular
vote

the
claim
comes
just
days
after
ellen
weintraub
the
chair
of
the
federal
election
commission
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
telling
him
to
shut
up
about
his
vote-fraud
claims
or
come
up
with
evidence
that
there's
any
truth
to
them
trump
established
an
investigative
panel
on
voter
fraud
to
substantiate
his
claims
in
but
it
came
up
with
nothing
and
disbanded
weintraub
warned
that
trump's
unsubstantiated
claims
undermine
faith
in
the
election
system
she
said
she
was
using
words
a
former
casino
operator
could
understand
you
need
to
lay
your
cards
on
the
table
or
fold
instead
of
folding
trump
raised
trump's
new
claim
was
apparently
sparked
by
a
fox
business
report
monday
about
psychologist
robert
epstein's
research
he
recently
testified
before
senators
that
his
research
has
shown
that
google's
search
algorithms
may
have
impacted
undecided
voters
in
a
way
that
gave
at
least
million
votes
to
clinton
his
study
sample
however
involved
just
voters
of
whom
considered
themselves
undecided
google
denied
that
its
search
algorithms
are
politically
biased
and
has
said
that
epstein's
study
methodology
was
fatally
flawed
this
researcher's
inaccurate
claim
has
been
debunked
since
it
was
made
in
google
said
in
a
statement
to
cnbc
as
we
stated
then
we
have
never
re-ranked
or
altered
search
results
to
manipulate
political
sentiment
clinton
made
much
of
the
undecided
voters
in
epstein's
research
in
a
twitter
clapback
the
debunked
study
you're
referring
to
was
based
on
undecided
voters
for
context
that's
about
half
the
number
of
people
associated
with
your
campaign
who
have
been
indicted
