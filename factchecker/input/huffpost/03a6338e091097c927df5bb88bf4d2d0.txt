california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
has
come
out
in
support
of
ab-
legislation
that
would
reclassify
many
gig
economy
workers
from
independent
contractors
to
employees
guaranteeing
them
labor
protections
and
benefits
and
potentially
upending
the
business
models
of
tech
companies
like
uber
and
lyft
in
an
opinion
piece
in
the
sacramento
bee
on
monday
which
was
labor
day
newsom
said
he
was
proud
to
be
supporting
assembly
bill
which
details
the
conditions
under
which
a
worker
should
be
considered
an
employee
and
therefore
entitled
to
benefits
like
a
minimum
wage
unemployment
and
disability
insurance
and
a
right
to
form
a
union
our
economy
has
stopped
working
for
working
people
corporate
profits
have
gone
through
the
roof
while
worker
pay
has
remained
in
the
basement
newsom
wrote
in
the
piece
contributing
to
this
imbalance
is
the
misclassification
of
workers
where
companies
eager
to
save
on
labor
costs
identify
workers
as
independent
contractors
rather
than
employees
rideshare
companies
uber
and
lyft
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
drivers
in
california
who
are
currently
considered
independent
contractors
the
companies
have
been
lobbying
against
the
legislation
as
their
bottom
lines
would
be
dramatically
affected
by
having
drivers
newly
classified
as
employees
for
whom
they'd
have
to
pay
additional
benefits
and
protections
hundreds
of
uber
and
lyft
drivers
with
the
organizing
group
gig
workers
rising
protested
throughout
california
last
month
demanding
ab-
s
passage
and
a
union
for
drivers
the
legislation
overwhelmingly
passed
in
the
assembly
in
may
and
is
set
to
next
be
voted
on
in
the
state
senate
after
which
it
will
go
to
newsom's
desk
exactly
how
the
law
would
affect
rideshare
companies
and
their
drivers
when
applied
in
practice
is
still
unclear
the
legislation
is
based
on
a
california
supreme
court
decision
in
the
case
of
dynamex
operations
which
established
an
abc
test
for
classifying
workers
as
employees
with
ab-
expected
to
pass
uber
lyft
and
other
companies
have
committed
tens
of
millions
to
back
a
ballot
initiative
which
would
push
a
separate
classification
for
rideshare
drivers
the
companies
have
proposed
providing
certain
protections
that
drivers
have
been
demanding
like
a
minimum
pay
floor
as
well
as
supporting
sectoral
bargaining
which
would
allow
drivers
across
the
industry
to
join
together
and
negotiate
better
conditions
from
their
companies
in
their
push
to
keep
drivers
as
independent
contractors
the
companies
have
also
been
spreading
the
idea
that
if
drivers
were
made
employees
they
would
lose
their
flexible
scheduling
one
driver
organizer
annette
rivero
told
techcrunch
in
august
that
there
was
no
truth
to
the
companies
claim
that
the
legislation
would
affect
drivers
flexibility
a
lyft
spokesperson
acknowledged
to
huffpost
that
there
was
nothing
explicitly
in
the
law
that
would
affect
drivers
flexibility
but
added
that
the
practical
reality
was
that
due
to
the
bigger
financial
burden
of
having
drivers
as
employees
the
companies
would
likely
not
maintain
scheduling
flexibility
asked
what
newsom
would
be
willing
to
support
in
potential
future
talks
with
uber
and
lyft
around
how
their
drivers
were
classified
the
governor's
office
told
huffpost
they
wouldn't
speculate
on
hypotheticals
adding
that
the
governor
has
made
his
priority
clear
fairness
for
workers
higher
wages
meaningful
benefits
and
the
ability
to
organize
