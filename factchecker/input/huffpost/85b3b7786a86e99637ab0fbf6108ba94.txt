biden
defends
faulty
telling
of
military
heroism
story
the
essence
of
his
recollection
is
correct
the
former
vice
president
told
a
south
carolina
newspaper
greenville
s.c.
ap
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
on
thursday
defended
his
faulty
description
of
a
tale
of
military
heroism
and
his
interactions
with
the
service
members
who
carried
it
out
the
essence
of
his
recollection
is
correct
the
former
vice
president
told
a
south
carolina
newspaper
thursday
after
a
washington
post
story
detailed
how
an
emotional
anecdote
biden
told
recently
while
campaigning
in
new
hampshire
contained
inaccuracies
biden's
telling
appeared
to
conflate
multiple
events
yielding
a
single
story
of
vice
president
biden
pinning
a
silver
star
on
a
u.s.
navy
captain
in
the
konar
province
of
afghanistan
for
his
efforts
trying
to
save
another
service
member
in
his
latest
telling
of
a
story
he's
varied
over
several
years
according
to
the
post
biden
got
most
of
the
details
wrong
there's
no
military
record
of
that
specific
ceremony
and
biden's
records
as
a
senator
show
he
traveled
to
konar
when
he
was
senate
foreign
relations
committee
chairman
and
before
he
was
vice
president
biden
and
his
aides
countered
that
the
anecdote's
fundamental
point
that
as
vice
president
he
once
formally
recognized
the
valor
of
a
heartbroken
solider
who
didn't
want
the
recognition
because
his
fellow
solider
ultimately
lost
his
life
is
true
the
central
point
is
it
was
absolutely
accurate
what
i
said
biden
told
the
post
and
courier
newspaper
of
charleston
south
carolina
hours
after
the
post
published
its
story
he
refused
the
medal
i
put
it
on
him
he
said
don't
do
that
to
me
sir
he
died
he
died
indeed
the
post
account
quoted
staff
sgt
chad
workman
recalling
that
he
received
a
bronze
star
from
biden
at
forward
operating
base
airborne
in
wardak
province
afghanistan
on
jan
workman
confirmed
biden's
account
adding
that
biden
treated
him
with
empathy
in
an
interview
with
washington
post's
jonathan
capehart
biden
suggested
the
account
he
was
referring
to
was
workman's
story
i
was
making
the
point
how
courageous
these
people
are
how
incredible
they
are
this
generation
of
warriors
these
fallen
angels
we've
lost
he
said
i
don't
know
what
the
problem
is
what
is
it
that
i
said
wrong
the
accounts
represent
a
growing
conundrum
for
democrats
their
front-runner
is
hinging
his
campaign
on
the
propositions
that
president
donald
trump
is
a
serial
liar
and
a
fundamental
threat
to
the
nation
and
that
biden
a
year-old
veteran
of
u.s.
politics
and
world
affairs
offers
his
party
the
best
hope
of
victory
but
biden
is
also
repeatedly
subjected
to
media
scrutiny
social
media
derision
and
quiet
grumbling
from
his
rivals
over
his
penchant
for
verbal
missteps
a
cacophony
that
fosters
questions
about
whether
he
is
indeed
the
best
democrat
to
send
into
a
general
election
campaign
against
trump
biden
rejected
those
questions
telling
the
post
and
courier
they
are
ridiculous
veteran
democratic
strategist
david
axelrod
said
the
episode
speaks
to
two
well-known
attributes
of
biden
his
liability
as
undisciplined
and
his
strength
as
one
who
empathizes
with
those
in
pain
axelrod
doesn't
see
it
as
particularly
damaging
but
notes
such
episodes
should
they
continue
could
answer
one
of
the
central
question
facing
biden
is
he
up
to
the
intellectual
rigors
of
being
president
where
it
becomes
problematical
is
if
it's
seen
as
evidence
of
some
sort
of
decay
said
axelrod
a
former
senior
adviser
to
president
barack
obama
that
is
obviously
a
danger
anything
that
raises
those
concerns
is
problematic
i
don't
think
this
is
the
one
that
could
tip
the
scales
biden's
supporters
this
week
in
south
carolina
have
been
unfazed
by
any
mounting
criticism
particularly
in
comparison
to
trump
who
regularly
misspeaks
and
has
treated
truth
casually
since
he
first
launched
his
campaign
in
look
at
trump
a
habitual
sinister
liar
said
dawn
deboskey
a
year-old
from
anderson
south
carolina
the
vice
president
is
absolutely
on
point
discussing
every
issue
in
a
knowledgeable
way
i
have
zero
concerns
at
the
campaign
town
hall
where
deboskey
came
to
see
biden
the
candidate
opted
for
a
humorous
defense
against
those
who
question
whether
he's
still
up
for
the
job
on
education
he
opted
against
offering
detailed
numbers
when
talking
through
his
usual
riff
on
the
need
for
more
social
workers
offer
a
number
and
turn
out
to
be
wrong
biden
said
and
the
press
will
say
biden's
losing
his
mind
he
