democratic
presidential
candidate
kamala
harris
has
a
slightly
bizarre
but
surprisingly
apt
description
of
president
donald
trump
a
puffy
fish
the
california
senator
used
the
marine
metaphor
friday
during
a
speech
at
the
democratic
national
committee's
meeting
in
san
francisco
to
describe
how
the
president
deals
with
the
national
rifle
association
and
its
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
when
he
coddles
the
nra
you
know
he
blusters
a
lot
it
reminds
me
of
a
puffy
fish
she
said
he's
just
always
blustering
right
then
he
gets
a
few
calls
from
wayne
lapierre
and
all
of
a
sudden
nothing
of
what
we
need
to
have
in
terms
of
smart
gun
safety
laws
in
this
country

it
might
be
strange
to
think
of
the
president
as
a
fish
but
the
connection
becomes
more
obvious
when
trump's
face
is
placed
next
