olivia
payne
a
rising
senior
at
the
beacon
school
in
manhattan
says
she
often
participates
in
strikes
at
her
school
she's
been
pushing
her
parents
to
be
more
aware
of
ways
they
could
be
more
environmentally
conscious
too
there's
always
underlying
dread
because
we
know
impending
doom
is
coming
but
at
the
same
time
it's
inspired
me
to
be
aware
of
my
own
personal
actions
payne
said
overall
though
she
found
the
friday
strike
comforting
especially
seeing
how
many
adults
showed
up
pada
schaffner
a
rising
senior
at
dwight
school
in
manhattan
has
been
involved
with
climate
action
since
he
was
a
young
child
when
his
parents
used
to
take
him
to
rallies
now
he
works
to
get
his
classmates
involved
it
can
be
hard
to
convince
a
classmate
that
going
to
a
strike
is
more
important
than
turning
in
whatever
they
have
due
friday
but
overall
i
think
this
generation
does
realize
how
important
this
issue
is
specifically
to
us
he
said
gretta
reed
an
environmental
science
teacher
at
saint
ann's
school
in
brooklyn
has
dealt
with
worried
middle-school
students
who
see
climate
change
as
the
issue
of
their
generation
i
think
the
kids
are
thinking
about
it
they
have
a
lot
of
anxiety
about
it
it's
a
part
of
their
everyday
life
now
reed
said
whether
or
not
people
are
teaching
it
the
kids
are
needing
it
and
learning
it
themselves
