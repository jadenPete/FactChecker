hillary
clinton's
response
to
a
lizzo
tweet
is
truly
something
the
former
secretary
of
state
tweeted
a
line
from
truth
hurts
at
the
singer
confirming
that
love
for
lizzo
transcends
politics
we're
not
going
to
text
you
we'll
tell
it
straight
to
your
face
former
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton
tweeted
truth
hurts
lyrics
at
lizzo
and
no
we're
not
kidding
on
tuesday
the
singer
tweeted
a
short
clip
of
various
presidential
hopefuls
including
clinton
and
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
about
to
observe
the

to
the

with
the
opening
of
the
song's
first
verse
i
just
took

the
full

it's
not
clear
why
clinton
or
her
team
chose
to
respond
to
this
tweet
in
this
way
but
relating
with
singers
and
rappers
seems
to
be
all
the
rage
these
days
rapper
cardi
b
has
long
been
an
admirer
of
sanders
and
last
week
the
senator's
team
released
a
video
of
her
interviewing
him
about
police
reform
minimum
wage
and
health
care
and
earlier
this
month
the
team
of
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
tweeted
a
line
from
truth
hurts
in
response
to
a
now-unavailable
tweet
fresh

so
if
this
country
is
looking
for
something
to
unite
both
parties
it
seems
our
biggest
hope
may
lie
in
lizzo
