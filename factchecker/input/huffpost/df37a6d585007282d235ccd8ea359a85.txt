of
the

greg

said
thursday
that
mistakes
were
made
in
a
fundraising
letter
calling
to
defend
texas
from
illegal
immigration
just
a
day
before
the
mass
shooting
in
el
paso
i
did
get
the
chance
to
visit
with
the
el
paso
delegation
and
help
them
understand
that
mistakes
were
made
and
course
correction
has
been
made
abbott
said
speaking
ahead
of
the
meeting
of
the
newly
formed
texas
safety
commission
abbott
said
he
spoke
with
el
paso
lawmakers
about
the
letter
and
emphasized
the
importance
of
making
sure
that
rhetoric
will
not
be
used
in
any
dangerous
way
the
two-page
fundraising
mailer
sent
from
abbott's
office
was
dated
one
day
before
a
gunman
killed
people
at
a
walmart
in
el
paso
on
aug
police
say
the
alleged
gunman
later
admitted
that
he
had
targeted
mexicans
with
his
rampage
in
his
letter
first
obtained
by
the
texas
signal
abbott
speaks
of
the
need
to
defend
the
u.s.
mexico
border
in
texas
capitalizing
bold-facing
and
underlining
the
word
it
asks
republicans
for
contributions
toward
my
billion
plan
to
secure
our
border
with
mexico
it
also
attacks
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
as
a
radical
socialist
and
calls
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
and
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
reprobates
the
national
democrat
machine
has
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
it
hopes
to
turn
texas
blue
if
they
can
do
it
in
california
they
can
do
it
in
texas
if
we
let
them
the
governor
wrote
according
to
the
texas
tribune
he
ended
unless
you
and
i
want
liberals
to
succeed
in
their
plan
to
transform
texas
and
our
entire
country
through
illegal
immigration
this
is
a
message
we
must
send
the
letter
surfaced
last
week
in
a
report
by
the
tribune
the
texas
democratic
party
blasted
abbott's
mailer
as
racist
anti-immigrant
anti-latino
and
said
the
governor's
comments
thursday
did
not
constitute
an
apology
the
first
step
in
solving
a
problem
is
admitting
we
have
one
in
that
respect
this
texas
safety
commission
meeting
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
however
let's
be
clear
governor
abbott
and
the
republican
party's
white
supremacist
rhetoric
like
that
seen
in
abbott's
fundraising
mailer
the
day
before
the
el
paso
shooting
continues
to
be
a
major
part
of
the
problem
manny
garcia
executive
director
of
the
texas
democratic
party
said
in
a
statement
he
added
governor
abbott
refuses
to
apologize
for
this
racist
fundraising
mailer
and
won't
answer
questions
about
ending
his
racist
rhetoric
immediately
abbott
has
also
faced
a
backlash
in
recent
days
for
suggesting
in
a
tweet
that
undocumented
immigrant
children
should
not
be
given
a
public
education
as
the
supreme
court
decided
in
the
case
plyler
v
doe
the
governor
on
aug
retweeted
a
twitter
user
who
griped
that
tax
dollars
are
paying
for
illegals
to
be
educated
