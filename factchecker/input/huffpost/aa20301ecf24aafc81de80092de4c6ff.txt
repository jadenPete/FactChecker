dispel
any
potential
doubts
from
poland
over
whether
the
u.s.
is
committed
to
safeguarding
its
ally
from
election
meddling
trump
has
failed

community
indicating
russia
played
a
role
in

told

at
the
white
house
last
month
that
he
would
support
russia
rejoining
the
g-
a
stance
other
countries
don't
share
i
think
it's
much
more
appropriate
to
have
russia
in
he
said
echoing
remarks
he
made
last
year
it
should
be
the
g-
because
a
lot
of
the
things
we
talk
about
have
to
do
with
russia
trump

it
very
favorably

joint
press
statements
with
polish
president
andrzej
duda
after
their
meeting
in
warsaw
poland
on
monday
according
to
reuters
duda
expressed
reluctance
at
the
prospect
during
his
briefing
with
pence
raising
concerns
over
whether
relations
with
russia
could
be
reestablished
at
this
point
unfortunately
over
the
last
several
years
russia
has
taken
actions
which
cannot
be
ignored
by
anyone
who
respects
international
law
duda
said
in
this
context
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
whether
this
means
we
can
approach
russia
in
a
business
as
usual
way
during
a
summit
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
last
year
trump
infamously
questioned
whether
the
country
had
actually
meddled
in
the
presidential
election
he
later
attempted
to
walk
back
his
comments
and
offer
support
for
u.s.
intelligence
agencies
in
june
at
the
g-
summit
in
japan
trump
indicated
that
he
was
still
taking
the
matter
lightly
jokingly
telling
putin
to
keep
out
of
the
election
don't
meddle
in
the
election
he
said
smiling
at
putin
and
wagging
