two
other
republicans
who
have
announced
long-shot
bids

win
their
party's

his
decision
to
run
during
an
appearance
on
fox
news
sunday
telling
host
chris
wallace
that
hurricane
dorian
disrupted
his
original
plan
to
announce
in
south
carolina
i
am
here
to
tell
you
now
that
i
am
going
to
get
in
sanford
said
of
the
gop
presidential
primary
i
think
that
as
the
republican
party
we
have
lost
our
way
he
said
the
epicenter
of
his
campaign
is
focused
on
the
national
deficit
the
president
has
called
himself
the
king
of
debt
has
a
familiarity
and
comfort
level
with
debt
that
i
think
is
ultimately
leading
us
in
the
wrong
direction
sanford
said
the
numbers
are
astounding
two
other
republicans
former
rep
joe
walsh
of
illinois
and
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
have
already
jumped
into
the
primary
race
against
trump
trump's
steadfast
support
from
republicans
coupled
with
his
massive
campaign
war
chest
has
created
a
daunting
path
for
those
seeking
to
unseat
him
from
within
the
gop
a
gallup
poll
conducted
last
month
showed
trump
with
a
approval
rating
across
political
parties
but
an
approval
rating
from
republicans
you've
got
to
know
you
basically
have
no
chance
of
winning
the
republican
nomination
wallace
told
sanford
on
sunday
so
why
run
for
president
sanford
responded
that
you
never
know
once
every
four
years
we
have
a
chance
to
have
a
national
debate
on
where
we're
going
next
as
republicans
and
democrats
and
as
americans
he
said
and
the
thing
that
has
been
lacking
in
this
debate
has
been
an
earnest
and
real
conversation
on
debt
and
deficits
and
government
spending

the
appalachian
trail
for
a
week
but
actually
traveled
to
argentina
to
engage
in
an
extramarital
affair
though
he
faced
bipartisan
backlash
over
the
incident
he
was
elected
to
the
house
again
in
he
was
an
outspoken
critic
of
trump
during
his
most
recent
congressional
tenure
drawing
the
president's
ire
and
likely
causing
him
to
lose
reelection
