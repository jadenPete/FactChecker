a
continued
republican
attempt

add
comic
flair
to

merchandise
trump's
reelection
campaign
soaked
up
more
than
in
less
than
two
weeks
last
month
selling
overpriced
plastic
straws
with
a
dig
against
liberal
paper
straws
trump
however
may
not
appreciate
the
greenland
humor
the
wall
street
journal
reported
last
week
that
trump
had
spoken
about
buying
greenland
with
varying
degrees
of
seriousness
asking
the
white
house
counsel
to
explore
whether
it
was
a
possibility
a
day
later
greenland's
foreign
minister
ane
lone
bagger
told
reuters
the
answer
is
no
we
are
open
for
business
but
we're
not
for
sale
bagger
said
but
that
didn't
stop
the
trump
administration
from
acting
as
if
a
potential
deal
was
still
on
the
table
on
sunday
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
told
fox
news
that
the
matter
was
developing
and
that
the
white
house
was
looking
at
it
trump
then
confirmed
to
reporters
that
the
large
real
estate
deal
was
something
we
talked
about
that
brought
a
response
from
denmark's
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
who
reiterated
that
the
island
is
not
for
sale
and
called
the
idea
absurd
trump
apparently
irked
over
the
rebuff
tweeted
on
tuesday
that
he
had
canceled
his
upcoming
trip
to
denmark
and
griped
to
reporters
that
frederiksen's
remark
was
nasty
frederiksen
said
wednesday
she
was
disappointed
and
surprised
by
trump's
snub
the
associated
press
reported
