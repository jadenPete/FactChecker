it
didn't
follow
through
on
its
promise
to
allow
more

to
supply
cannabis
for

more
than
three
years
after
the
drug
enforcement
administration
said
it
would
remove
barriers
to
researchers
accessing
legal
marijuana
for
the
purposes
of
scientific
research
the
department
of

announced
the
wait
is
finally
over
the
announcement
comes
two
days
before
a
deadline
for
the
dea
to
respond
to
a
lawsuit
from
researchers
who
have
long
wanted
to
study

as
a
treatment
for
post-traumatic

disorder
chronic
pain
and
dozens
of
other
conditions
now
dea
officials
say
they
are
finally
reviewing
applications
from
marijuana
growers
who
hope
to
supply
researchers
with
cannabis
dea
is
making
progress
in
the
program
to
register
additional
marijuana
growers
for
federally
authorized
research
and
will
work
with
other
relevant
federal
agencies
to

the
necessary
next
steps
dea
acting
administrator
uttam
dhillon
said
monday
we
support
additional
research
into
marijuana
and
its
components
and
we
believe
registering
more
growers
will
result
in
researchers
having
access
to
a
wider
variety
for
study
for
about
five
decades
the
only
authorized
supplier

has
been
a
cannabis
garden
at
the
university
of
mississippi
overseen
by
the
national
institute
on

abuse
nida
researchers
complained
that
the
monopoly
made
it
hard
to
get
supplies
in
a
timely
manner
and
the
dea
promised
in
august
that
it
would
expand
the
program
to
more
growers
but
when
the
dea
didn't
review
or
acknowledge
the
growers
who
applied
to
participate
researchers
sued
the
curtailment
of
the
nida
monopoly
would
almost
certainly
increase
the
supply
of
the
drug
to
the
research
community
and
make
researchers
less
dependent
on
ole
miss
for
their
product

hudak
senior
fellow
of
governance
studies
at
the
brookings
institute
said
in
though
there
are
zero
deaths
linked
to
a
marijuana
overdose
the
dea
classifies
the
plant
under
the
schedule
category
of
dangerous
drugs
the
most
aggressively
banned
category
which
also
includes
heroin
