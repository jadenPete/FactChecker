why
planned
parenthood
can't
totally
write
off
susan
collins
the
group
has
been
under
pressure
to
cut
ties
with
the
gop
senator
but
she
still
remains
a
much-needed
ally
in
the
fight
against
the
title
x
abortion
gag
rule
planned
parenthood
announced
on
tuesday
that
it
will
no
longer
be
part
of
the
federal
title
x
program
which
provides
contraception
and
other
family
planning
services
to
low-income
individuals
the
group
which
treats
more
than
of
the
roughly
million
people
who
benefit
from
title
x
said
it
could
not
in
good
conscience
abide
by
new
administration
rules
that
restrict
how
its
clinics
could
talk
about
abortion
planned
parenthood
is
suing
president
donald
trump's
administration
in
court
to
block
this
gag
rule
which
allows
title
x
recipients
to
still
talk
about
abortion
with
their
patients
but
prohibits
them
from
giving
people
information
about
where
to
get
an
abortion
such
as
the
name
of
a
provider
or
the
location
of
a
clinic
aside
from
a
court
order
the
best
hope
for
the
group
is
congress
the
house
has
already
passed
a
funding
bill
that
blocks
the
gag
rule
the
road
will
be
much
steeper
if
not
impossible
in
the
gop-controlled
senate
but
if
it's
going
to
go
anywhere
it
needs
to
start
in
the
senate
committee
on
health
education
labor
and
pensions
which
oversees
the
title
x
program
and
if
it's
going
to
get
out
of
committee
it
will
likely
need
the
support
of
susan
collins
r-maine
putting
planned
parenthood
in
a
complicated
relationship
with
a
senator
who
is
increasingly
the
focus
of
progressive
anger
collins
is
one
of
the
few
gop
senators
who
support
abortion
rights
luckily
for
planned
parenthood
she
and
sen
lisa
murkowski
r-alaska
sit
on
the
committee
giving
abortion
rights
supporters
a
majority
both
collins
and
murkowski
oppose
the
gag
rule
and
sent
a
letter
to
health
and
human
services
secretary
alex
azar
about
it
last
year
the
best
way
to
reduce
the
number
of
abortions
is
to
expand
access
to
family
planning
services
collins
said
in
a
statement
to
huffpost
that's
why
i
have
long
been
a
strong
supporter
of
title
x
family
planning
and
why
i
have
repeatedly
opposed
attempts
to
impose
gag
orders
or
burdensome
requirements
for
separate
facilities
on
both
clinics
in
the
united
states

sen
susan
collins
r-maine
has
traditionally
received
support
from
planned
parenthood
but
many
liberal
activists
want
the
group
to
drop
her
in
because
of
her
support
for
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
a
number
of
progressive
groups
have
supported
collins
over
the
years
believing
that
she
was
one
of
the
few
reasonable
republicans
left
in
the
caucus
who
supported
issues
like
lgbtq
equality
the
environment
and
abortion
the
relationship
has
long
been
fraying
with
activists
asking
why
progressive
organizations
weren't
working
harder
to
elect
a
democrat
who
would
be
on
their
side
all
the
time
we
can
replace
lawmakers

an
email
sent
out
wednesday
morning
by
the
group
emily's
list
which
works
to
elect
democratic
women
who
support
abortion
rights
the
most
dramatic
break
came
last
year
when
collins
voted
to
confirm
brett
kavanaugh
to
the
supreme
court
reproductive
rights
supporters
were
especially
dismayed
by
collins
vote
since
it
put
in
place
a
conservative
majority
that
could
overturn
roe
v
wade
or
at
the
very
least
dramatically
weaken
abortion
rights
in
the
country
collins
had
also
voted
to
confirm
conservative
neil
gorsuch
to
the
supreme
court
in
and
she's
been
a
reliable
vote
to
confirm

planned
parenthood
has
left
the
federal
title
x
program
because
of
new
restrictions
on
discussing
abortion
with
patients
implemented
by
president
donald
trump's
administration
but
it's
not
yet
clear
whether
the
group
will
endorse
gideon
or
another
collins
challenger
as
a
forceful
message
of
disillusionment
with
the
senator
it's
been
widely
reported
that
the
organization
backed
collins
in
but
planned
parenthood
action
fund
said
it
never
endorsed
her
although
it
did
give
her
for
the
campaign
so
there
was
support
but
not
a
formal
endorsement
it
then
endorsed
her
democratic
challenger
in
and
stayed
neutral
in
her
race
but
in
even
after
her
vote
for
gorsuch
planned
parenthood
gave
her
an
award
recognizing
her
for
being
an
outspoken
champion
for
women's
health
planned
parenthood
also
has
a
more
complicated
relationship
with
collins
than
straight-up
advocacy
groups
do
the
group
still
has
to
operate
clinics
across
the
country
and
relies
on
people
like
the
senator
for
funding
for
programs
maintaining
at
least
a
cordial
working
relationship
with
collins
and
other
gop
politicians
is
something
planned
parenthood
arguably
has
to
do
for
its
survival
the
gop
senator
has
also
backed
and
helped
save
planned
parenthood
over
the
years
in
july
for
example
she
was
one
of
the
key
republican
votes
that
killed
her
party's
legislation
to
repeal
obamacare
one
of
the
reasons
she
opposed
it
was
that
it
would
have
defunded
planned
parenthood
if
planned
parenthood
were
defunded
other
family
planning
clinics
in
maine
including
community
health
centers
would
see
a
percent
increase
in
their
patient
load
she
said
at
the
time
some
patients
would
need
to
drive
greater
distances
to
receive
care
while
others
would
have
to
wait
longer
for
an
appointment
this
is
about
interfering
with
the
ability
of
a
woman
to
choose
the
health
care
provider
who
is
right
for
her
but
her
record
isn't
perfect
she
has
also
voted
to
approve
or
move
forward
on
measures
that
would
among
other
things
take
away
funding
from
planned
parenthood
or
title
x.
it's
a
tricky
balance
for
planned
parenthood
and
some
other
progressive
groups
if
collins
loses
but
the
gop
retains
control
of
the
senate
an
anti-abortion
republican
would
likely
take
her
place
on
the
help
committee
and
collins
is
also
next
in
line
to
chair
the
powerful
appropriations
committee
but
if
there's
a
chance
to
defeat
collins
and
get
a
more
reliable
democrat
in
the
chamber
isn't
it
worth
it
democrats
need
to
flip
at
least
three
seats
to
retake
control
of
the
senate
and
maine
is
one
of
their
top
targets
money
is
already
pouring
into
the
race
with
democrats
determined
to
defeat
her
and
republicans
rewarding
her
for
her
vote
for
kavanaugh
defunding
family
planning
providers
and
endangering
the
health
care
of
tens
of
thousands
of
low-income
mainers
those
are
the
devastating
results
we're
seeing
in
the
era
of
sen
collins
and
president
trump
said
alex
stack
spokesman
for
the
maine
democratic
party
this
comes
after
senator
collins
voted
for
more
than
of
trump's
anti-choice
judges
including
two
supreme
court
justices
who
now
threaten
the
future
of
roe
v
wade
he
added
any
pro-choice
credibility
senator
collins
once
had
is
long
gone
of
course
defeating
the
gag
rule
needs
more
than
just
collins
and
murkowski
aside
from
planned
parenthood
there
are
now
eight
states
now
saying
they
will
no
longer
accept
the
federal
funds
the
fallout
from
the
title
x
gag
rule
could
be
significant
in
some
states
like
alaska
connecticut
minnesota
and
utah
planned
parenthood
manages
the
title
x
networks
in
some
rural
areas
it's
the
only
provider
for
communities
to
receive
family
planning
services
on
tuesday
alexis
mcgill
johnson
acting
president
of
planned
parenthood
said
a
mobile
health
clinic
in
ohio
will
no
longer
be
able
to
operate
and
go
into
the
community
to
provide
testing
for
sexually
transmitted
infections
she
also
said
some
patients
would
have
long
wait
times
for
care
or
may
forgo
services
when
the
senate
understands
what's
happening
and
when
they
hear
from
their
supporters
they
will
be
way
more
engaged
around
this
mcgill
johnson
said
susan
collins
and
lisa
murkowski
are
both
on
record
opposing
the
gag
rule
so
we
will
continue
to
reach
out
to
them
and
their
offices
to
garner
support
but
this
impacts
every
senator's
home
state
