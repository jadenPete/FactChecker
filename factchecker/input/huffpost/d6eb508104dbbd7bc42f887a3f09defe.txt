would
reap

for

save

annually
in

president
donald
trump
won't
stop
haranguing
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
to
cut
the
fed
interest
rate
again
now
by
as
much
as
a
full
percentage
point
one
entity
that
would
save
millions
annually
from
such
a
move
would
be
trump's
own
company
along
with
its
various
businesses
the
washington
post
reports
that
before
he
became
president
trump
borrowed
more
than
million
in
four
loans
from
deutsche
bank
for
his
hotels
in
chicago
and
washington
d.c.
and
his
doral
golf
resort
in
florida
all
of
the
loans
have
variable
interest
rates
according
to
trump's
financial
disclosure
statements
that
means
the
more
he
can
convince
powell
to
lower
the
fed
rate
the
more
money
he'll
save
lower
interest
rates
would
also
help
americans
paying
mortgages
but
it
would
hurt
people
on
fixed
incomes
with
little
or
no
debt
who
count
on
interest
from
savings
accounts
or
savings
vehicles
such
as
certificates
of
deposit
which
would
pay
less
interest
trump
already
benefited
when
the
fed
cut
short-term
rates
in
july
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
decade
by
a
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
bloomberg
found
that
for
every
quarter-point
reduction
in
rates
trump
could
save
in
annual
interest
rate
payments
on
his
loans
that
would
mean
trump
could
reap
more
than
million
in
annual
savings
if
the
fed
dropped
rates
a
full
percentage
point
as
trump
is
demanding
bloomberg
estimates
that
trump
now
owes
about
million
a
year
on
his
loans
a
full-point
rate
percentage
cut
is
typically
done
during
an
economic
emergency
and
trump
claims
the
american
economy
is
booming
critics
say
such
a
cut
would
leave
the
fed
with
little
extra
stimulus
space
in
the
event
the
economy
craters
trump
unlike
other
presidents
has
retained
his
businesses
despite
accusations
of
conflict
of
interest
as
he
weighs
what's
best
for
him
against
what's
best
for
the
american
economy
powell
said
friday
at
a
federal
reserve
symposium
in
jackson
hole
wyoming
that
lowering
rates
further
might
not
be
enough
to
protect
the
american
economy
from
trump's
trade
policy
he
said
the
president's
trade
war
with
china
has
created
a
complex
turbulent
situation
that
was
threatening
the
economy
trade
policy
uncertainty
seems
to
be
playing
a
role
in
the
global
slowdown
and
in
weak
manufacturing
and
capital
spending
in
the
united
states
powell
warned
after
the
remarks
trump
again
slammed
powell
indicating
he
was
a
bigger
enemy
of
the
u.s.
than
china
my
only
question
is
who
is
our
bigger
enemy
jay
powell
or
chairman
xi
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
before
he
was
president
trump
often
called
for
lower
interest
rates
which
benefited
his
real
estate
business
the
post
noted
trump
has
grabbed
every
dollar
he
can
in
business
he
has
been
sued
dozens
of
times
for
nonpayment
of
bills
in
his
businesses
he
used
money
from
his
charity
organization
to
pay
off
legal
settlements
for
his
for-profit
businesses
and
was
forced
to
shut
down
the
foundation
he
once
sued
deutsche
bank
to
duck
out
of
a
hefty
mortgage
according
to
the
post
he
has
also
dodged
debts
by
declaring
bankruptcy
six
times
