washington
ap
new
immigration
rules
on
obtaining
citizenship
for
children
of
u.s.
service
members
and
government
employees
born
overseas
do
not
affect
birthright
citizenship
officials
said
thursday
rules
rolled
out
a
day
earlier
caused
confusion
among
immigration
lawyers
after
a
document
appeared
to
show
children
of
american
citizens
would
be
affected
officials
with
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
briefed
reporters
thursday
in
an
effort
to
clarify
the
regulations
and
said
that
if
a
child
is
born
overseas
to
a
u.s.
citizen
who
is
a
service
member
or
government
employee
then
that
child
will
be
an
american
citizen
there
is
a
policy
change
and
it
will
affect
between
and
people
per
year
officials
said
the
change
is
a
residency
requirement
shift
and
affects
u.s.
service
members
or
government
employees
who
are
green
cardholders
and
have
a
child
while
on
duty
overseas
or
adopt
a
child
who
is
not
a
citizen
or
are
the
stepparent
of
a
foreign-born
child
previously
the
agency
essentially
waived
u.s.
residency
requirements
for
those
people
to
apply
for
a
passport
for
their
child
but
the
officials
said
the
state
department
would
then
decline
the
application
for
not
fitting
the
requirements
the
policy
shift
aligns
with
the
state
department
requirements
and
will
require
a
paperwork
change
applications
for
u.s.
service
members
stationed
overseas
can
still
be
processed
while
they
are
on
active
duty
the
residency
requirement
mostly
affects
government
employee
green
cardholders
stationed
overseas
they
would
need
to
move
back
to
the
u.s.
and
live
there
for
three
years
to
five
years
in
order
to
apply
for
citizenship
for
their
child
the
highly
technical
policy
manual
update
wednesday
contradicted
parts
of
an
page
memo
the
agency
initially
put
out
that
implied
american
citizens
were
among
those
whose
children
would
no
longer
be
automatically
granted
citizenship
if
born
abroad
immigrant
advocates
have
said
the
trump
administration
has
unfairly
treated
members
of
the
military
who
aren't
american
citizens
defense
department
spokeswoman
lt
col
carla
m.
gleason
said
in
a
statement
that
the
department
worked
closely
with
citizenship
and
immigration
services
and
understands
the
estimated
impact
of
this
particular
change
is
small
after
a
barrage
of
confusion
from
advocates
lawyers
and
journalists
the
agency's
acting
director
ken
cuccinelli
played
down
the
changes
in
a
twitter
statement
saying
the
update
doesn't
deny
citizenship
to
children
of
government
and
military
members
this
policy
aligns
uscis
process
with
the
department
of
state's
procedures
for
these
children
that's
it
period
however
small
the
change
was
another
roadblock
that
the
trump
administration
has
placed
for
people
to
live
legally
in
the
united
states
trump
has
said
he
believes
a
merit-based
system
of
immigration
is
better
for
the
u.s.
than
a
family-based
one
as
it
is
now
and
has
been
working
to
make
changes
to
how
the
system
works
and
follows
other
more
sweeping
changes
to
immigration
laws
