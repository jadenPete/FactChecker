maintained
an
active
schedule
there
is
currently
no

added
no

ginsburg
made
her
first
public
appearance
since
finishing
treatment
receiving
an
honorary
degree
from
the
university
at
buffalo
where
she
appeared
strong
and
healthy
it's
the
best
and
the
hardest
job
i
ever
had
and
it's
what
has
kept
me
going
through
four
cancer
bouts
instead
of
concentrating
on
my
aches
and
pains
i
just
know
i
have
to
read
this
set
of
briefs
draft
opinions
so
i
have
to
surmount
whatever
is
going
on
in
my
body
and
concentrate
on
the
court's
work
