an
aapi
moderator
would
not
only
spotlight
topics
that
the
community
grapples
with
but
also
would
be
mindful
of
cultural
sensitivities
aapis
are
not
monolithic
we
are
not
one
big
group
aapis
are
descendants
of
many
countries
and
we
subscribe
to
different
cultures
and
ideologies
meng
said
it
is
important
that
these
differences
are
known
and
understood
and
having
an
aapi
moderator
would
ensure
that
they
are
she
also
said
it's
only
appropriate
that
the
debate
stage
reflect
the
diverse
population
of
our
country
