trump's
hurricane
dorian
map
looks
mighty
suspicious
during
a
hurricane
briefing
the
president
held
up
an
out-of-date
map
that
appeared
hastily
altered
to
add
alabama
to
the
storm
path
it's
well
known
that
donald
trump
doesn't
like
to
admit
he's
wrong
but
somebody
may
have
gone
to
extreme
lengths
on
wednesday
to
protect
his
ego
during
a
hurricane
briefing
the
president
showed
an
old
weather
map
suggesting
dorian
was
previously
on
track
to
hit
florida
however
it
appeared
as
if
someone
took
a
sharpie
pen
to
the
map
to
draw
a
swoosh
around
southern
alabama
the
alteration
was
presumably
meant
to
correspond
with
an
incorrect
tweet
the
president
posted
on
saturday
saying
the
hurricane
was
headed
there
and
which
the
national
weather
service
had
to
correct
in
a
tweet
of
its
own
the
suspicious
mark
quickly
caught
the
attention
of
various
twitter
users
of
course
soothing
the
president's
fragile
ego
comes
at
a
price
journalists
reaching
out
to
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
about
the
president's
map
didn't
get
a
comment
they
got
something
more
chilling
huffpost
reached
out
to
the
white
house
press
office
which
did
not
immediately
respond
when
a
journalist
asked
trump
if
he
altered
the
weather
map
to
include
alabama
he
didn't
deny
the
accusation
entirely
