gets
schooled
on
twitter
after
showing
how
clueless
he
is
on
climate
the
gop
senator
tried
to
troll
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
but
it
backfired

ted
cruz
r-texas
has
been
raked
over
the
coals
for
a
painfully
unaware
tweet
about
climate
change
um
el
paso
is
land-locked
cruz
wrote
on
thursday
in
response
to
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke's
claim
that
his
young
son
feared
global
warming
would
soon
make
their
home
city
uninhabitable
cruz
followed
it
up
with
this
gif
hundreds
of
tweeters
were
quick
to
remind
cruz
however
that
climate
change
does
not
only
affect
sea
levels
