elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
the
two
most
progressive
top-tier
candidates
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
defended
their
ability
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
during
campaign
swings
through
new
hampshire
on
labor
day
weekend
offering
spirited
though
somewhat
different
cases
for
their
general
election
viability
warren
had
to
address
the
electability
question
directly
since
it
came
up
in
a
brief
question
session
with
voters
on
monday
following
remarks
to
a
crowd
of
that
braved
the
rain
to
hear
her
speak
in
the
backyard
of
a
supporter
in
the
coastal
town
of
hampton
falls
linda
rhodes
a
warren
partisan
active
in
the
liberal
advocacy
group
indivisible
new
hampshire
asked
warren
what
to
tell
people
who
say
they
like
warren's
ideas
but
are
not
sure
she
can
beat
trump
in
the
general
election
warren
began
by
promoting
her
pugnacity
i
know
how
to
fight
and
i
know
how
to
win
she
said
that
is
a
big
part
of
it
you
have
to
be
willing
to
get
in
this
fight
all
the
way
she
also
argued
that
backing
a
candidate
with
ambitious
ideas
for
solving
people's
problems
many
of
which
predate
trump
is
a
surer
way
to
motivate
them
to
show
up
on
election
day
than
merely
promising
to
roll
back
the
clock
to
before
trump's
presidency
being
willing
to
confront
the
big
problems
in
this
country
and
then
producing
plans
real
plans
for
big
structural
change
that's
what
people
want
in
this
country
warren
said
i
think
you've
got
to
give
people
a
reason
to
show
up
and
vote
and
that's
what
i'm
doing
in
her
response
warren
appeared
to
take
a
veiled
swipe
at
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
has
argued
that
if
trump
loses
his
presidency
will
be
seen
as
an
aberration
rather
than
the
product
of
structural
problems
plaguing
the
country
what's
going
to
carry
us
as
democrats
is
not
playing
it
safe
warren
said
it's
not
pretending
that
everything
was
just
fine
and
then
there
was
this
one
problem
and
we
get
rid
of
that
one
problem
it's
all
going
to
work
out
cause
it's
not
it's
not
we
have
problems
going
back
decades
now
sanders
took
a
more
prosaic
approach
to
the
topic
in
three
campaign
speeches
in
raymond
and
dover
new
hampshire
and
portland
maine
on
sunday
the
vermont
senator
who
has
led
trump
in
polls
of
a
hypothetical
matchup
since
sanders
unsuccessful
primary
run
made
the
argument
for
his
general
election
viability
by
pointing
to
polls
that
show
him
ahead
once
again
he
is
especially
fond
of
citing
a
late
august
poll
that
showed
him
beating
trump
by
percentage
points
the
same
survey
conducted
by
quinnipiac
university
found
that
five
democrats
would
beat
trump
though
biden
had
the
largest
margin
of
victory
with
a
point
edge
warren
bested
trump
by
points
sanders
summarized
the
poll
results
to
a
crowd
of
over
in
raymond
before
setting
out
the
stakes
of
a
potential
showdown
with
trump
whom
he
dubbed
the
most
dangerous
president
in
the
modern
history
of
this
country
we
have
to
get
rid
of
that
person
in
the
white
house
and
with
your
help
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
do
he
declared
ben
cohen
and
jerry
greenfield
top
sanders
surrogates
and
co-founders
of
the
vermont-based
ice
cream
brand
ben
jerry's
had
a
similar
message
in
their
remarks
introducing
sanders
in
poll
after
poll
cohen
said
bernie
beats
trump
he
repeated
the
phrase
like
a
mantra
until
the
crowd
assembled
in
chairs
in
a
muggy
high
school
auditorium
repeated
it
like
a
chant
bernie
beats
trump
bernie
beats
trump
at
their
core
though
sanders
and
warren
share
a
conviction
that
they
are
running
not
just
to
undo
trump's
policies
but
to
curb
the
economic
inequality
and
political
corruption
that
they
maintain
have
gripped
the
country
for
at
least
four
decades
i'm
going
to
need
your
help
the
day
after
we
are
inaugurated
sanders
said
in
raymond
we
need
your
help
to
take
on
the
greed
and
corruption
of
the
corporate
elite
who
have
been
at
war
against
the
working
class
of
this
country
for
the
last
years
both
candidates
electability
pitches
are
likely
responses
to
biden's
standing
in
the
polls
he
has
led
the
pack
in
early
primary
and
caucus
states
since
entering
the
race
in
april
poll
watchers
tend
to
attribute
biden's
lead
at
least
partly
to
his
perceived
strength
as
a
general
election
candidate
the
former
vice
president
has
projected
an
air
of
inevitability
training
his
attention
on
trump
far
more
than
on
his
democratic
rivals
and
in
august
biden's
wife
jill
explicitly
pitched
her
husband's
electability
telling
iowans
you
may
like
another
candidate
better
but
you
have
to
look
at
who
is
going
to
win
although
warren
and
sanders
are
often
cast
as
the
most
idealistic
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
field
there
was
some
evidence
over
the
holiday
weekend
that
voters
are
buying
the
pragmatic
case
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
ticket
sue
hartman
a
retired
educator
who
came
to
see
sanders
in
portland
maine
stood
outside
the
state
theatre
after
sanders
spoke
to
a
crowd
of
almost
people
on
sunday
night
with
a
look
of
awed
exhaustion
on
her
face
asked
why
she
supported
sanders
hartman
volunteered
his
strength
as
a
general
election
contender
who
can
step
up
and
slay
the
dragon
none
of
those
other
candidates
can
slay
the
dragon
the
way
bernie
can
she
said
the
others
don't
have
the
fire
in
the
belly
kevin
webb
a
renewable
energy
professional
from
exeter
new
hampshire
who
came
to
see
warren
in
hampton
falls
likewise
pointed
to
how
she
would
fare
against
trump
i
don't
think
trump
can
keep
up
with
her
all
he
has
is
a
racist
label
and
nothing
else
said
webb
referring
to
trump's
repeated
mockery
of
warren
as
pocahontas
because
of
the
native
american
heritage
she
has
claimed
other
voters
who
came
to
see
the
two
candidates
described
enjoying
hearing
them
speak
but
expressed
more
confidence
in
other
candidates
abilities
to
defeat
trump
john
leahy
a
retired
information
technology
firm
manager
from
exeter
who
came
with
three
family
members
to
hear
warren
speak
on
monday
said
after
the
speech
that
he
was
leaning
toward
biden
the
former
vice
president's
more
moderate
profile
leahy
reasoned
makes
him
potentially
a
very
strong
candidate
against
trump
regina
phillips
a
consultant
who
came
to
see
sanders
speak
in
portland
with
her
two
sisters
said
after
his
speech
that
she
was
feeling
the
bern
but
pressed
on
her
plans
for
the
maine
primary
slated
for
super
tuesday
on
march
phillips
said
she
was
still
undecided
i
need
to
actually
see
who
can
beat
donald
trump
that's
the
person
i
can
vote
for
she
said
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
bernie
he
said
he's
percent
ahead
of
trump
but
i
know
biden's
ahead
of
trump
too
