is
a
public

closing

san
francisco
chesa
boudin's
dad
has
been
incarcerated
since
he
was
just
a
year
old
and
his
mom
was
behind
bars
for
decades
he
thinks
that
makes
him
the
best
candidate
for
district
attorney
of
san
francisco
the
experience
of
having
parents
incarcerated
is
actually
sadly
really
normal
in
this
country
boudin
told
huffpost
in
august
noting
that
nearly
half
of
americans
have
close
family
currently
or
formerly
in
jail
or
prison
that's
a
lived
experience
that
is
in
many
ways
a
defining
part
of
modern
american
culture
but
one
that's
all
too
often
removed
from
or
ignored
by
the
political
class
now
a
san
francisco
deputy
public
defender
boudin
was
months
old
when
his
parents
then
members
of
the
radical
leftist
group
the
weather
underground
were
jailed
for
driving
the
getaway
car
in
an
infamous
armed
robbery
in
new
york
in
which
two
police
officers
and
a
security
guard
were
killed
his
father
is
still
in
new
york
state
prison
serving
a
years-to-life
sentence
and
his
mother
who
was
paroled
in
has
since
earned
her
ph
d.
and
runs
an
initiative
focused
on
criminal
justice
and
reentry
at
columbia
university
boudin's
progressive
platform
for
district
attorney
includes
closing
jails
eliminating
cash
bail
combating
racism
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
diverting
people
from
jails
and
prisons
the
nov
election
will
be
the
first
time
in
over
a
century
that
san
francisco
has
an
open
da
race
without
an
incumbent
after
outgoing
district
attorney
george
gasc
n
d
said
he
won't
run
for
reelection
and
all
four
candidates
in
the
race
will
be
newcomers
to
elected
office
if
they
win
the
other
front-runner
alongside
boudin
suzy
loftus
legal
counsel
in
the
san
francisco
sheriff's
department
and
former
president
of
the
city's
police
commission
is
also
running
on
a
progressive
platform
a
former
prosecutor
loftus
has
lined
up
high-profile
endorsements
from
presidential
candidate
sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
who
was
her
former
boss
in
the
california
department
of
justice
as
well
as
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
and
san

mayor
london
breed
boudin
meanwhile
has
received
support
from
two
recent
candidates
in
a
growing
movement
of
progressive
prosecutors
nationwide
larry
krasner
now
da
in
philadelphia
and
tiffany
cab
n
who
recently
narrowly
lost
in
queens
he
also
has
the
backing
of
big-name
progressives
like
activist
angela
davis
and
the
bernie
sanders-backed
group
our
revolution
while
boudin
identifies
as
a
small
s
socialist
he
said
he
doesn't
find
political
party
labels
particularly
useful
adding
that
there
are
many
different
subgroups
in
the
democratic
party
no
matter
the
outcome
in
november
boudin
plans
to
visit
his
dad
in
prison
after
the
election
i
think
that's
in
many
ways
the
defining
feature
of
this
race
boudin
said
of
growing
up
with
incarcerated
parents
i
think
it's
imperative
people
who
make
the
decisions
about
who
should
be
sent
to
prison
for
what
for
how
long
have
an
understanding
of
that
experience
boudin
grew
up
going
to
prison
to
visit
his
parents
since
he
was
five
years
old
he's
spent
two
to
four
nights
a
year
with
his
father
in
state
prison
sleeping
in
basically
a
trailer
home
as
he
put
it
cooking
together
doing
homework
watching
sports
on
a
small
tv
growing
up
visiting
my
parents
in
prison
is
a
defining
part
of
my
life
it's
what
led
me
to
start
working
on
criminal
justice
issues
starting
in
grade
school
boudin
said
adding
that
he
wrote
to
his
dad's
prison
warden
at
age
to
advocate
for
changes
in
visitation
policy
that
gives
me
a
breadth
of
perspective
that's
extremely
rare
in
candidates
for
office
his
parents
kathy
boudin
and
david
gilbert
were
unarmed
in
the
robbery
but
were
charged
with
felony
murder
under
new
york
law
for
their
involvement
gilbert
will
be
eligible
for
parole
in
at
age
boudin
called
the
law
that
put
his
parents
away
for
so
long
draconian
on
the
other
hand
i'm
really
mindful
of
the
fact
that
three
families
lost
a
loved
one
boudin
added
they
all
had
kids
those
men
will
never
come
back
those
families
will
never
be
whole
again
and
there's
nothing
anybody
can
do
not
me
my
parents
not
the
state
to
restore
those
families
to
be
what
they
were
he
noted
that
very
serious
consequences
for
actions
like
those
of
his
parents
were
appropriate
as
a
deterrent
and
to
honor
and
dignify
the
suffering
of
those
families
with
his
parents
behind
bars
boudin
was
raised
by
two
of
their
friends
fellow
weather
underground
members
and
grew
up
in
chicago
they
were
an
upper-middle-class
family
he
went
to
private
school
then
yale
for
college
got
a
master's
at
oxford
and
went
to
yale
law
school
in
many
ways
i
was
lucky
he
said
of
his
childhood
i
started
off
like
so
many
kids
with
parents
in
prison
traumatized
destabilized
and
behind
my
classmates
in
terms
of
education
behavior
control
socialization
but
very
few
are
lucky
enough
to
have
white
skin
privilege
and
the
kinds
of
support
i
had
he
said
boudin
saw
therapists
as
a
toddler
had
academic
tutors
and
could
afford
to
visit
his
parents
in
prison
whenever
he
liked
now
central
to
boudin's
platform
for
da
is
ending
racist
disparities
that
plague
every
step
of
our
criminal
justice
system
in
san
francisco
black
people
are
nine
times
more
likely
to
be
booked
into
jails
than
white
people
according
to
a
human
rights
watch
analysis
of
county
data
in
liberal
san
francisco
all
the
candidates
in
the
race
including
leif
dautch
a
california
deputy
attorney
general
and
nancy
tung
an
alameda
county
prosecutor
are
touting
their
progressive
values
and
calling
for
some
measure
of
reform
to
the
criminal
justice
system
though
tung
as
the
more
tough-on-crime
candidate
is
considered
the
most
moderate
but
boudin
insists
that
while
their
rhetoric
may
seem
similar
there
are
specific
proposals
in
his
platform
and
experiences
in
his
record
that
set
him
apart
he's
the
only
public
defender
in
the
race
and
was
a
leader
in
the
yearslong
effort
in
san
francisco
and
california
to
challenge
the
cash
bail
system
earlier
this
year
a
federal
judge
ruled
that
san
francisco's
cash
bail
system
violated
the
rights
of
poor
defendants
the
judge
still
has
to
issue
an
injunction
for
the
system
to
change
in
practice
and
at
the
state
level
california
residents
will
be
voting
in
on
whether
to
eliminate
cash
bail
statewide
boudin
is
also
pushing
for
a
dedicated
immigration
unit
in
the
da's
office
that
would
among
other
things
advise
attorneys
how
to
pursue
charges
that
would
be
fair
for
a
given
crime
without
having
additional
life-altering
consequences
such
as
deportation
boudin
said
he
also
wants
the
da's
office
to
pursue
charges
against
federal
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agents
if
they
come
into
our
neighborhoods
and
break
the
law
as
he
put
it
they're
acting
like
the
gestapo
in
our
communities
and
somebody
has
to
stand
up
to
them
and
i
will
boudin
said
of
ice
he's
also
committed
to
closing
jails
namely
san
francisco's
county
jail
no
where
inmates
are
housed
in
a
building
considered
seismically
unsafe
his
plan
is
for
the
city
to
reduce
the
total
inmate
population
across
all
its
jails
so
this
one
can
be
closed
for
now
jail
should
be
a
last
resort
boudin
said
noting
that
many
people
are
there
simply
because
they
can't
afford
bail
on
a
given
day
in
nearly
half
of
the
jail
population
in
san
francisco
would
have
been
eligible
for
release
if
those
inmates
simply
posted
bail
per
a
report
from
the
office
of
the
city
treasurer
about
of
people
booked
in
san
francisco's
jails
are
homeless
or
insecurely
housed
according
to
the
city
health
commission
about
in
are
diagnosed
as
seriously
mentally
ill
and
about
three-quarters
reported
substance
use
not
including
marijuana
boudin
wants
every
arrest
to
be
an
opportunity
for
intervention
to
divert
people
from
the
criminal
justice
system
into
programs
for
mental
health
addiction
and
housing
we
need
a
district
attorney
who
understands
the
big
picture
and
what's
driving
crime
we
can't
jail
our
way
out
of
the
problem
he
said
suzy
loftus
team
says
she
wants
the
same
things
the
year-old
san
francisco
native
and
former
prosecutor
also
supports
closing
county
jail
no
and
calls
for
alternatives
to
locking
people
in
jails
and
prisons
to
address
our
over-reliance
on
incarceration
her
website
says
loftus
is
proposing
creating
a
civil
rights
unit
in
the
da's
office
to
address
racial
bias
in
the
system
her
spokesperson
debbie
mesloh
said
the
unit
would
also
look
at
issues
like
wrongful
convictions
and
immigration
which
boudin
has
stressed
in
his
campaign
but
boudin
argues
that
loftus
rhetoric
doesn't
match
her
record
as
a
prosecutor
loftus
says
she
supports
ending
money
bail
she
used
money
bail
in
her
entire
career
as
prosecutor
to
detain
poor
people
boudin
said
she
says
she
supports
decriminalizing
prostitution
and
homelessness
and
supports
legalizing
marijuana
but
as
a
line
attorney
she
prosecuted
all
those
cases
mesloh
responded
that
the
criminal
justice
system
had
evolved
clearly
since
loftus
days
as
a
prosecutor
she
worked
in
the
da's
office
from
to
this
experience
would
allow
loftus
as
da
to
execute
on
changes
they're
all
calling
for
on
reform
that's
needed
mesloh
added
having
entered
the
race
months
after
loftus
boudin
was
neck
and
neck
with
her
when
the
latest
june
fundraising
numbers
came
out
with
around
raised
for
boudin
and
for
loftus
in
late
august
just
weeks
after
her
loss
in
the
queens
da
race
cab
n
also
a
public
defender
traveled
to
san
francisco
to
campaign
for
boudin
she
said
his
unique
experience
of
having
incarcerated
parents
ties
him
to
the
people
he
would
be
serving
as
district
attorney
this
is
not
just
about
bringing
this
movement
to
san
francisco
it's
understanding
that
electing
someone
like
chesa
as
da
it's
going
to
have
an
effect
around
the
country
cab
n
said
we
need
to
strengthen
this
team
of
not
just
progressive
but
decarceral
prosecutors
she
added
listing
krasner
kim
foxx
state's
attorney
in
chicago's
cook
county
and
rachael
rollins
da
in
boston's
suffolk
county
that's
why
i
flew
across
the
country
it's
not
just
about
san
francisco
but
about
the
movement
nationally
