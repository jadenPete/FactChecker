signed
a
bill
banning
commercial
and

fur
trapping
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
signed
a
bill
wednesday
that
makes
it
illegal
to
trap
animals
or
sell
their
fur
making
california
the
first
state
in
the
u.s.
to
impose
a
fur
trapping
ban
the
wildlife
protection
act
of
puts
an
end
to
a
longstanding
practice
that
was
entwined
with
california's
frontier
roots
but
that
has
steadily
declined
in
recent
decades
with
the
rise
of
conservationism
historically
fur
trapping
played
a
significant
role
in
the
extirpation
of
wolves
and
wolverines
and
the
severe
declines
in
sea
otters
fishers
marten
beaver
and
other
fur-bearing
species
in
california
the
bill
states
because
individual
trappers
concentrate
their
operations
in
limited
geographical
areas
they
can
locally
deplete
populations
of
the
species
they
target
impairing
the
ecological
functioning
of
the
area
and
diminishing
opportunities
for
wildlife
watching
in
these
areas
the
legislation
notes
prohibiting
fur
trapping
would
eliminate
the
needless
taxpayer
subsidized
killing
of
california's
native
species
for
the
international
fur
trade
while
better
protecting
the
role
these
species
place
in
our
ecosystems
and
economy

the

the
number

fur
trapping
have
declined
in

years
according
to
the

resulting
in
animals
trapped
and
pelts
sold
animals
commonly
trapped
for
their
fur
in
california
include
coyotes

foxes
beavers

the
new
law
it
will
still
be
legal
to
trap
rats

state
lawmakers
are
also
considering
legislation
that
would
ban
the

of
all
fur
products
along
with
a
bill
to
prohibit
circuses
from
using
most
animals
in
their
performances
in
the
state
there's
been
a
real
change
in
attitudes
about
how
we
treat
animals
