the

former
secretary
of
defense
jim
mattis
on
sunday
expressed
regret
for
criticizing
joe
biden
in
his
new
memoir
claiming
he
wouldn't
have
been
as
harsh
had
he
known
the
former
vice
president
would
launch
a
bid
for
the
white
house
margaret
brennan
host
of
cbs's
face
the
nation
read
an
excerpt
of
mattis
book
call
sign
chaos
learning
to
lead
in
which
he
suggests
biden
ignored
advice
from
intelligence
officials
who
cautioned
against
the
obama
administration's
withdrawal
from
the
iraq
war
he
exuded
the
confidence
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
made
up
perhaps
even
indifferent
to
considering
the
consequences
were
he
judging
the
situation
incorrectly
mattis
wrote
in
the
book
mattis
told
brennan
he
had
begun
writing
his
history
book
in
and
was
unaware
that
biden
now
a
democratic
front-runner
whose
candidacy
was
long
suspected
would
actually
run
had
i
known
that
the
former
vice
president
was
going
to
run
for
office
i
assure
you
i
would
not
have
probably
been
that
forthcoming
he
said
still
mattis
defended
his
assessment
of
biden
speculating
that
the
administration
had
decided
prematurely
to
pull
u.s.
troops
out
of
iraq
the
intelligence
community
was
very
clear
he
said
they
forecasted
the
rise
of
a
group
you
and
i
know
it
as
isis
and
we
should
have
taken
their
advice
on
board
mattis
served
under
former
presidents
george
w.
bush
and
barack
obama
and
he
has
discussed
his
policy
differences
with
each
of
them
but
he
has
taken
particular
care
to
avoid
any
criticism
of
president
donald
trump
in
his
writing
and
during
interviews
mattis
said
tuesday
during
a
q
a
session
with
council
on
foreign
relations
president
richard
haass
that
he
would
speak
out
about
the
current
administration
when
the
time's
right
he
offered
no
indication
as
to
when
he
would
break
his
silence
i
don't
believe
that
if
you
leave
an
administration
over
a
matter
of
policy
that
you
then
get
out
and
start
talking
in
what
we
commonly
call
a
kiss-and-tell
now
he
said
i
don't
think
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
mattis
stepped
down
from
his
post
as
defense
secretary
last
year
with
a
resignation
letter
that
appeared
to
scrutinize
trump's
military
judgment
and
imply
that
the
president
did
not
take
seriously
the
threat
of
authoritarianism
in
russia
and
china
