jr
accused

of
the
washington
post
of
burning
westerhout
but
steven
ginsberg
national
editor
at
the
washington
post
said
in
a
statement
to
politico
that
rucker
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
scrupulous
reporters
in
the
news
business
he
has
always
acted
with
the
utmost
honor
and
integrity
and
has
never
violated
washington
