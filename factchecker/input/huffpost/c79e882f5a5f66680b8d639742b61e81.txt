shepard
smith
went
after
donald
trump's
endless
lies
thursday
and
called
the
president's
erroneous
warning
about
hurricane
dorian
threatening
alabama
fake
news
defined
smith
wondered
why
the
president
can't
simply
admit
he
was
wrong
instead
of
wasting
days
and
days
insisting
he's
right
some
things
in
trumplandia
are
inexplicable
smith
scoffed
on
shepard
smith
reporting
trump
insisted
sunday
in
a
tweet
and
again
later
that
day
that
dorian
was
threatening
alabama
which
was
quickly
corrected
by
the
national
weather
service
on
wednesday
trump
justified
his
warning
by
pointing
to
a
national
hurricane
center
map
of
dorian's
possible
route
that
had
clearly
been
altered
with
some
kind
of
marker
to
clumsily
include
alabama
everybody
makes
mistakes
smith
said
instead
the
president
blamed
the
media
for
his
own
inaccurate
warning
and
then
started
to
rewrite
history
on
the
matter
and
used
doctored
graphics
smith
asked
why
would
the
president
of
the
united
states
do
this
he
decries
fake
news
that
isn't
and
disseminates
fake
news
that
is
on
thursday
trump
tweeted
another
map
which
appeared
to
show
a
thin
sliver
of
alabama
potentially
in
the
path
of
winds
he
has
no
clue
what
he's
talking
about
or
what
is
plotted
on
that
map
university
of
miami
hurricane
researcher
brian
mcnoldy
told
the
associated
press
about
trump's
latest
offering
at
the
time
of
that
cycle
alabama
was
at
even
lower
risk
than
before
and
it
was
barely
anything
to
start
with
instead
of
tweeting
it
would
have
been
a
good
time
for
trump
to
apologize
and
move
on
said
smith
that
map
was
from
the
day
the
hurricane
became
a
hurricane
it
was
four
days
old
at
the
precise
time
he
said
alabama
would
likely
be
hit
harder
than
anticipated
by
then
it
was
fake
news
defined
on
a
very
serious
subject
smith
also
listed
trump's
other
multiple
lies
think
china
pays
the
tariffs
the
wall
is
going
up
historic
inauguration
crowds
the
russia
probe
was
