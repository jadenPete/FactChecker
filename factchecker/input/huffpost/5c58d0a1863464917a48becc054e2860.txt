democratic
presidential
candidate
marianne
williamson
on
wednesday
tweeted
then
quickly
deleted
a
message
that
credited
power
of
the
mind
and
positive
visualization
for
turning
hurricane
dorian
away
from
land
the
problem
of
course
dorian
made
that
turn
over
the
bahamas
which
it
hit
as
a
category
storm
leaving
the
islands
in
a
state
of
total
devastation
williamson's
tweet
overlooked
what's
been
described
as
an
apocalyptic
scene
miles
east
of
palm
beach
there's
nothing
wrong
with
mindfulness
prayer
or
positive
visualization
but
it's
critically
important
people
heed
the
warnings
of
the
national
weather
service
and
take
action
when
told
to
do
so
for
the
record
nuking
hurricanes
a
method
reportedly
suggested
multiple
times
by
president
donald
trump
is
also
a
dangerous
idea
williamson
replaced
the
deleted
tweet
with
a
call
for
peace
and
comfort
for
those
affected
by
the
storm
in
the
meantime
the
threat
posed
by
hurricane
dorian
is
far
from
over
the
storm
could
yet
come
ashore
in
georgia
south
or
north
carolina
all
of
which
remain
within
the
national
hurricane
center's
forecast
cone
south
carolina
is
bracing
for
what
could
be
the
the
region's
second-worst
flooding
in
years
and
more
than
million
people
along
the
coast
from
florida
to
north
carolina
have
been
urged
to
evacuate
