administration
is
not

in
migrant
children's
shelters
immigrant
advocates
say
the
government
is
legally
required
to
provide
these
services
the
trump
administration
is
failing
to
fund
legal
services
for
detained
immigrant
children
some
under
years
old
in
three
shelters
huffpost
has
learned
that
violates
federal
law
and
could
have
life-threatening
consequences
for
the
minors
immigration
lawyers
say
in
july
huffpost
reported
that
the
administration
was
not
providing
legal
services
to
children
in
a
now-closed
temporary
facility
in
carrizo
springs
texas
which
held
a
few
hundred
immigrants
even
though
federal
law
and
a
court
settlement
require
the
government
to
inform
detained
migrant
kids
of
their
legal
rights
and
to
ensure
access
to
counsel
to
the
greatest
extent
practicable
the
information
was
first
reported
by
reveal
at
the
time
the
government
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
paying
for
legal
aid
in
the
shelter
which
a
spokesperson
chalked
up
to
budgetary
issues
that
would
soon
be
resolved
the
government
now
claims
it
is
funding
legal
aid
for
immigrant
minors
in
all
shelters
but
multiple
legal
aid
attorneys
told
huffpost
that's
not
true
these
lawyers
said
they
are
working
for
free
without
the
government
money
they
usually
receive
for
their
services
legal
service
organizations
confirmed
that
the
federal
office
of
refugee
resettlement
which
is
responsible
for
sheltering
kids
detained
at
the
border
without
their
parents
is
not
paying
for
legal
aid
in
two
recently
opened
shelters
one
in
phoenix
houses
children
under
years
old
and
another
in
modesto
california
holds
teenage
mothers
and
their
children
there
is
also
no
legal
service
contract
in
place
for
a
separate
shelter
in
phoenix
that
is
being
reopened
and
is
expected
to
start
detaining
up
to
children
as
early
as
next
week
according
to
golden
mccarthy
the
children's
program
director
at
the
florence
immigrant
and
refugee
rights
project
which
provides
aid
to
detained
children
in
arizona
without
legal
help
immigrant
kids
must
go
through
complex
legal
proceedings
on
their
own
and
may
more
easily
be
deported
back
to
violent
situations
in
their
home
countries
the
stakes
are
literally
life
and
death
said
jennifer
podkul
an
interim
vice
president
at
kids
in
need
of
defense
kind
which
provides
services
to
the
modesto
shelter
if
a
kid
does
not
know
how
to
tell
their
story
to
an
adjudicator
our
government
runs
the
risk
of
sending
a
child
back
to
their
death
but
in
a
statement
to
huffpost
an
office
of
refugee
resettlement
spokesperson
denied
that
there
was
an
issue
with
the
contracts
and
said
the
government
is
now
providing
funding
for
legal
services
in
all
shelters
orr
has
completed
the
necessary
contractual
modifications
in
assuring
the
continuity
of
holistic
legal
services
to
all
uac
unaccompanied
alien
children
in
orr
care
provider
programs
the
spokesperson
wrote
in
an
email
the
availability
and
assignment
of
local
providers
at
orr
care
provider
programs
is
currently
the
contractual
responsibility
of
vera
vera
is
the
vera
institute
of
justice
a
nonprofit
research
organization
that
has
six
regional
contracts
with
the
government
under
which
it
then
subcontracts
with
legal
service
providers
to
visit
the
shelters
a
representative
from
that
organization
told
huffpost
any
statement
that
vera
has
withheld
services
we
are
allowed
to
provide
or
failed
to
advocate
for
additional
services
where
they
are
needed
is
simply
false
in
the
absence
of
government
funding
lawyers
have
been
visiting
the
shelters
pro
bono
to
make
sure
detained
children
know
their
rights
understand
what
to
expect
in
immigration
court
and
receive
at
least
some
legal
representation
an
unaccompanied
child
with
legal
representation
is
four
times
more
likely
to
be
granted
status
in
the
u.s.
than
one
without
according
to
an
analysis
of
court
data
by
syracuse
university
legal
aid
lawyers
said
that
since
june
they
have
received
no
warning
from
orr
before
a
new
shelter
opens
mccarthy
only
found
out
the
phoenix
center
was
being
reopened
in
early
september
she
said
when
she
received
an
email
from
an
employee
of
southwest
key
the
nonprofit
operator
for
the
shelter
mccarthy's
team
is
now
scrambling
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
service
the
anticipated
hundreds
of
children
on
a
pro
bono
basis
children
in
detention
centers
usually
receive
a
date
to
show
up
in
immigration
court
where
they
have
to
answer
basic
questions
about
themselves
their
families
and
the
legal
relief
they
are
seeking
mccarthy
said
her
staff
recently
helped
a
year-old
girl
tell
the
judge
difficult
information
about
her
family
and
how
she
wanted
to
be
reunited
with
her
sister
whose
whereabouts
she
didn't
know
and
return
to
central
america
without
her
organization's
help
mccarthy
said
the
year-old
would
have
been
in
court
alone
struggling
to
navigate
a
legal
system
too
complicated
for
most
adults
to
grasp
it's
really
on
the
immigrant
typically
to
explain
their
case
she
said
and
when
you
have
a
client
who
is
years
old
they
truly
cannot
explain
or
defend
themselves
if
children
miss
their
initial
court
hearing
they
are
given
a
deportation
order
to
leave
the
country
but
without
lawyers
visiting
the
shelters
kids
might
not
be
aware
of
how
the
process
works
and
the
consequences
of
being
absent
how
will
that
year-old
child
know
she
has
to
attend
court
or
will
be
deported
said
katie
annand
a
managing
attorney
at
kind's
san
francisco
and
fresno
california
offices
she
hasn't
been
to
law
school
and
has
had
no
preparation
session
on
the
immigration
court
process
some
immigration
advocates
told
huffpost
they
saw
the
lack
of
legal
aid
funding
as
part
of
a
larger
attempt
to
strip
immigrants
of
their
basic
rights
our
government
is
engaged
in
premeditated
deliberate
acts
of
cruelty
against
children
said
jonathan
ryan
the
executive
director
at
the
migrant
advocacy
and
legal
aid
group
refugee
and
immigrant
center
for
education
raices
i
don't
think
one
has
to
be
a
conspiracy
theorist
to
believe
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
systematically
dismantle
every
framework
of
support
for
any
immigrant
in
this
country
kind
and
the
florence
project
are
trying
to
meet
the
children's
needs
in
modesto
and
phoenix
but
it's
a
struggle
without
additional
government
funding
it
can
take
kind's
lawyers
an
entire
day
to
travel
to
and
from
the
modesto
shelter
where
the
organization
is
providing
pro
bono
services
and
kind
lacks
the
money
to
hire
additional
staff
annand
said
they
alternate
trips
to
the
shelter
with
lawyers
from
another
legal
service
organization
to
make
the
work
more
manageable
but
it's
not
a
permanent
solution
especially
if
the
number
of
detained
kids
grows
in
phoenix
mccarthy
said
the
florence
project
would
ideally
hire
a
full-time
team
of
six
people
to
service
a
shelter
with
hundreds
of
kids
but
that's
not
possible
without
government
funding
instead
she
will
have
to
ask
existing
staff
to
take
on
the
additional
work
which
again
is
not
a
sustainable
solution
mccarthy
hopes
the
government
will
come
through
with
a
contract
but
worries
about
the
long-term
consequences
if
orr
does
not
fund
legal
aid
i
think
that
children
will
inevitably
go
into
court
by
themselves
she
said
if
a
child
doesn't
have
parents
or
a
legal
guardian
moving
through
the
process
with
them
then
they
are
really
doing
it
on
their
own
that's
concerning
