trump
is
suddenly
very
worried
about
elizabeth
warren's
growing
crowds
the
president
insulted
the
democratic
candidate
and
complained
about
coverage
of
his
own
crowds
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
has
been
drawing
increasingly
large
crowds
as
she
campaigns
for
the
democratic
nomination
to
run
against
president
donald
trump
and
it's
not
just
her
supporters
who
have
noticed
on
tuesday
trump
attacked
warren
claiming
the
media
reports
inflated
her
crowd
size
then
for
good
measure
he
threw
in
his
racist
nickname
for
her
they
do
stories
so
big
on
elizabeth
pocahontas
warren's
crowd
sizes
adding
many
more
people
than
are
actually
there
and
yet
my
crowds
which
are
far
bigger
get
no
coverage
at
all
fake
news

although
trump
still
routinely
packs
arenas
he
famously
obsesses
over
his
crowd
sizes
and
often
wildly
inflates
the
number
especially
when
it
comes
to
those
gathered
outside
last
year
for
example
trump
claimed
to
have
an
overflow
crowd
of
people
outside
a
rally
in
missouri
however
a
city
official
told
cnn
that
or
so
were
outside
trump
has
repeatedly
touted
the
crowd
size
from
his
inauguration
then-white
house
press
secretary
sean
spicer
even
lied
about
it
in
a
press
conference
saying
the
crowd
was
the
the
largest
audience
to
ever
witness
an
inauguration
period
trump
also
ordered
a
government
photographer
to
edit
images
of
the
event
to
make
the
crowds
seem
larger
than
they
were
the
guardian
reported
last
year
given
that
obsession
many
of
trump's
critics
noticed
his
tweet
and
more
than
a
few
asked
him
the
same
thing
getting
nervous
