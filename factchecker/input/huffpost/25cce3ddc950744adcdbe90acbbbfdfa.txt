california's
push
to
get
trump's
tax
returns
could
be
a
slippery
slope
california
gov
gavin
newsom
has
been
celebrated
by
the
left
for
trying
to
force
trump
to
disclose
his
tax
returns
but
is
this
the
best
way
to
go
about
it
if
california
gov
gavin
newsom
d
gets
his
way
donald
trump
will
have
to
release
his
taxes
in
order
to
appear
on
the
state's
primary
presidential
ballot
next
year
in
late
july
newsom
signed
a
bill
requiring
that
any
presidential
or
gubernatorial
candidate
must
release
five
years
of
tax
returns
to
qualify
for
the
state's
primary
election
ballots
these
are
extraordinary
times
and
states
have
a
legal
and
moral
duty
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
ensure
leaders
seeking
the
highest
offices
meet
minimal
standards
newsom
wrote
in
his
signing
statement
but
aggressive
legal
suits
are
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
california's
new
law
arguing
that
states
shouldn't
be
able
to
add
new
requirements
about
who
can
run
for
president
willy-nilly
the
outcome
doesn't
matter
for
trump
or
the
election
but
it
could
have
profound
implications
for
future
presidential
elections
if
california's
law
withstands
these
legal
challenges
what
would
stop
a
swing
state
held
by
one
party
in
for
example
from
implementing
a
similar
requirement
designed
to
block
a
major
party
candidate
from
the
ballot
trump
and
the
national
republican
committee
quickly
filed
federal
lawsuits
against
the
measure
saying
the
law
is
unconstitutional
and
infringes
on
the
president's
free
speech
the
california
republican
party
filed
a
lawsuit
as
well
the
state
supreme
court
has
decided
to
hear
both
cases
in
a
matter
of
weeks
which
is
a
very
uncommon
move
according
to
leslie
gielow
jacobs
a
constitutional
law
professor
at
mcgeorge
school
of
law
in
sacramento
california
and
probably
means
the
justices
are
wary
of
the
new
push
lawyers
for
the
state
of
california
and
the
california
republican
party
will
deliver
their
briefs
to
the
state
supreme
court
in
just
two
weeks
in
the
u.s.
constitution
there
are
three
simple
requirements
that
one
must
meet
in
order
to
serve
as
president
you
must
be
over
the
age
of
you
must
be
a
natural-born
citizen
and
you
must
have
at
least
years
of
residency
the
constitution
is
clear
on
the
qualifications
for
someone
to
serve
as
president
and
states
cannot
add
additional
requirements
on
their
own
tim
murtaugh
a
spokesperson
for
the
trump
campaign
told
the
new
york
times
in
july
but
as
jacobs
pointed
out
the
the
framers
wanted
to
give
lots
of
power
to
the
states
for
any
elections
for
federal
office
the
u.s.
constitution
gives
the
states
lots
of
power
to
control
how
the
elections
take
place
she
broke
the
argument
down
as
a
matter
of
qualifications
versus
rules
there
are
three
solid
constitutionally
protected
qualifications
to
be
president
but
each
state
can
make
rules
about
how
those
elections
are
run
there
are
a
lot
of
disclosure
agreements
that
people
who
are
running
for
office
have
to
make
jacobs
said
in
fact
there
are
a
lot
that
people
who
hold
office
have
to
make
disclosure
requirements
as
a
condition
to
holding
office
are
pretty
routine
in
california
for
example
candidates
have
to
disclose
their
donors
donations
and
campaign
expenditures
other
legal
cases
from
the
s
and
s
have
established
how
judges
might
respond
to
this
one
said
chris
elmendorf
an
election
law
professor
at
the
university
of
california
davis
in
the
supreme
court
found
that
ohio
had
placed
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
independent
candidates
for
holding
them
to
an
early
filing
deadline
and
that
a
state
can't
go
too
far
in
interfering
with
the
national
political
process
then
the
supreme
court
ruled
in
that
setting
congressional
term
limits
was
also
unconstitutional
for
establishing
new
qualifications
for
federal
office
outside
of
what
the
constitution
had
already
established
a
similar
concern
might
arise
here
elmendorf
said
california
is
trying
to
disable
a
locally
unpopular
candidate
and
in
some
sense
thereby
interfering
with
a
national
political
process
on
the
other
hand
he
added
that
disclosure
is
part
of
our
political
tradition
and
that
the
law
could
be
seen
as
an
effort
to
hold
presidents
at
the
same
standards
that
legislators
themselves
comply
with
but
on
the
state
level
the
law
might
also
be
in
violation
of
proposition
a
state
constitutional
amendment
that
requires
the
state
legislature
to
provide
for
open
presidential
primary
by
listing
all
candidates
throughout
the
nation
or
california
and
such
candidates
whose
names
are
placed
on
ballot
by
petition
proposition
was
introduced
as
a
response
to
previous
election
ballots
that
excluded
candidates
from
across
the
u.s.
despite
an
impending
visit
to
the
bay
area
for
a
fundraising
event
on
sept
without
a
significant
primary
challenger
trump
won't
need
the
california
votes
and
he
wouldn't
lose
much
by
not
appearing
on
the
state's
primary
ballot
in
march
even
if
it's
just
a
symbolic
law
and
political
theater
for
newsom
who
ran
for
governor
promising
to
take
the
fight
to
the
trump
administration
a
law
like
this
could
still
have
dangerous
ramifications
even
newsom's
predecessor
said
the
same
former
gov
jerry
brown
vetoed
a
similar
measure
in
saying
he
feared
that
it
was
not
only
unconstitutional
but
that
even
more
concerning
a
law
like
this
could
set
a
slippery
slope
precedent
today
we
require
tax
returns
but
what
would
be
next
brown
said
at
the
time
five
years
of
health
records
a
certified
birth
certificate
high
school
report
cards
and
will
these
requirements
vary
depending
on
which
political
party
is
in
power
brown
was
hardly
thinking
in
hypotheticals
in
shortly
after
the
election
of
former
president
barack
obama
a
republican
congressman
from
florida
tried
to
introduce
a
law
requiring
all
presidential
candidates
to
submit
copies
of
their
birth
certificates
to
the
federal
elections
committee
a
qualified
candidate's
ability
to
appear
on
the
ballot
is
fundamental
to
our
democratic
system
brown
said
in
for
that
reason
i
hesitate
to
start
down
a
road
that
well
might
lead
to
an
ever
escalating
set
of
differing
state
requirements
for
presidential
candidates
but
it's
political
norms
everywhere
are
weakening
or
disappearing
and
for
now
all
bets
are
off
the
conventions
of
what's
within
and
out
of
bounds
are
entirely
up
for
grabs
elmendorf
said
so
it's
not
a
surprise
that
you're
seeing
this
kind
of
tax
disclosure
law
being
enacted
for
the
first
time
because
previously
no
president
would
violate
that
convention
if
you
think
of
a
sort
of
candidate
or
officeholder
as
intrinsically
illegitimate
anything
you
can
do
is
worth
doing
