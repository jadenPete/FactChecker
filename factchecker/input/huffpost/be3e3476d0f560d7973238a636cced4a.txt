the
incredibly
dangerous
solution
sacramento
has
for
homelessness
sacramento's
business
improvement
district
wants
to
use
a
civil
injunction
to
ban
seven
homeless
men
from
the
community
sacramento
along
sacramento's
broadway
corridor
the
iconic
art
deco
tower
theater
glows
bright
as
people
dine
at
queen
sheba
which
offers
some
of
the
best
ethiopian
food
in
the
area
andy
nguyen's
vegan
chinese
food
and
kathmandu
kitchen
are
other
neighborhood
favorites
along
with
l'amour
shoppe
where
sacramentans
have
long
turned
for
all
of
their
sex
toy
and
pornography
needs
like
most
cities
sacramento
gets
complaints
from
local
businesses
and
residents
that
people
experiencing
homelessness
are
a
nuisance
using
drugs
on
the
sidewalks
camping
in
tents
under
freeways
and
asking
pedestrians
for
money
or
food
so
several
members
of
the
local
business
improvement
district
with
the
support
of
democrat
mayor
darrell
steinberg
are
trying
something
unprecedented
they
have
filed
a
civil
injunction
against
seven
supposedly
disruptive
homeless
men
which
would
bar
them
from
entering
the
broadway
corridor
altogether
essentially
the
city
of
sacramento
is
filing
a
restraining
order
against
its
own
homeless
residents
it's
an
incredibly
dangerous
precedent
said
bob
erlenbusch
executive
director
of
the
sacramento
regional
coalition
to
end
homelessness
they
are
trying
to
get
rid
of
homeless
people
the
civil
suit
alleges
that
the
seven
men
have
repeatedly
harassed
threatened
or
otherwise
disrupted
business
owners
and
patrons
one
of
the
men
is
currently
in
jail
for
a
misdemeanor
charge
of
battery
against
an
elder
jmoor

getty

the
tower
theater
built
in
is
a
longstanding
broadway
corridor
institution
local
business
officials
contend
a
black
market
drug
trade
is
disrupting
the
area
our
team
is
constantly
dealing
with
the
aftermath
of
drug
activity
at
the
designated
area
said
joan
borucki
executive
director
of
the
greater
broadway
district
this
includes
dealing
with
the
human
waste
needle
pick-up
theft
car
break-ins
and
vandalism
on
a
daily
basis
while
there
is
a
small
handful
of
more
serious
crime
allegations
against
the
targeted
seven
men
the
lawsuit
mainly
cites
instances
of
public
drug
use
and
trespassing
that
is
attempting
to
use
restrooms
bathe
and
sleep
at
local
businesses
or
in
public
the
men
have
also
been
repeatedly
told
to
leave
informal
and
illegal
campsites
that
dot
the
city
mostly
underneath
freeway
overpasses
despite
having
no
where
else
to
go
the
stacks
of
allegations
against
them
appear
to
just
be
repeated
citations
for
trying
to
exist
while
homeless
and
battle
addiction
it's
as
much
a
catalog
of
their
torture
as
anything
said
niki
jones
a
board
member
of
the
sacramento
homeless
organizing
committee
sacramento
appears
to
be
the
first
city
to
propose
applying
civil
injunctions
to
its
homeless
population
but
the
legal
instrument
itself
has
a
long
history
in
california
starting
in
the
early
s
local
district
attorneys
began
using
injunctions
to
bar
suspected
gang
members
from
gathering
in
groups
drinking
alcohol
visiting
high-crime
areas
or
staying
out
past
p
m
civil
injunctions
were
originally
intended
as
a
progressive
alternative
to
prison
but
over
time
they've
morphed
into
something
very
different
in
more
than
people
overwhelmingly
young
men
of
color
were
subject
to
injunctions
in
los
angeles
alone
peter
arellano
an
la
resident
who
eventually
sued
the
city
over
his
lifelong
injunction
was
barred
from
wearing
dodgers
clothing
or
meeting
with
his
own
father
due
to
a
single
arrest
as
a
teenager
defense
lawyers
and
civil
rights
advocates
have
had
some
success
beating
back
the
widespread
use
of
civil
injunctions
in
los
angeles
stopped
adding
names
to
its
gang
injunction
database
after
a
federal
judge
found
that
the
legal
instrument
violated
suspects
right
to
due
process
other
cities
have
also
begun
to
shrink
their
injunction
lists
after
threats
of
legal
action
and
community
complaints
associated
press
tent
cities
in
sacramento
have
become
increasingly
common
but
sacramento's
move
opens
up
a
new
avenue
for
municipalities
to
use
civil
injunctions
and
due
to
their
low
standard
of
proof
and
relatively
easy
application
by
prosecutors
the
seven
cases
in
sacramento
may
just
be
the
beginning
there
are
currently
people
experiencing
homelessness
in
sacramento
a
percent
increase
from
per
a
june
report
from
the
sacramento
bee
of
those
people
percent
are
from
sacramento
and
have
lived
here
a
majority
of
their
lives
and
percent
are
unsheltered
not
all
businesses
in
the
area
are
in
favor
of
addressing
the
homeless
problem
with
injunctions
the
city
needs
a
more
hands-on
approach
by
helping
to
identify
the
people
here
and
sorting
out
the
major
problem
which
is
drug-related
said
steve
sylvester
owner
of
an
antique
shop
that's
been
in
the
neighborhood
for
years
and
advocates
are
ready
to
fight
it's
really
an
unbelievable
targeting
of
already
constantly
harassed
residents
by
powerful
business
interests
influencing
and
abusing
state
power
to
their
benefit
with
the
ongoing
goal
of
removing
those
they
deem
undesirable
from
public
space
said
jones
aside
from
being
punitive
and
harsh
to
the
homeless
population
there's
a
good
chance
the
injunctions
simply
will
not
work
dozens
of
cities
across
the
united
states
already
bar
homeless
people
from
panhandling
loitering
and
sleeping
in
their
cars
the
effectiveness
of
these
laws
in
reducing
crime
or
alleviating
homelessness
has
never
been
demonstrated
and
enforcing
them
may
cost
more
than
providing
housing
or
expanding
services
other
studies
have
found
that
most
assaults
and
homicides
carried
out
against
homeless
people
are
committed
in
poorly
lit
out-of-the-way
areas
exactly
the
places
injunctions
will
likely
push
them
to
given
that
the
majority
of
complaints
against
the
men
are
directly
related
to
drug
use
and
trespassing
the
solution
to
the
problem
advocates
say
lies
in
harm
reduction
affordable
housing
and
greater
resources
for
these
specific
men
and
the
homeless
community
at
large
beyond
her
role
with
the
sacramento
homeless
organizing
committee
jones
also
works
at
a
local
harm
reduction
center
as
a
syringe
exchange
service
and
referral
specialist
and
hiv
test
counselor
the
organization
provides
testing
for
hiv
and
stis
naloxone
distribution
and
education
on
overdose
prevention
and
syringe
exchange
these
kinds
of
services
coupled
with
affordable
housing
would
prevent
many
of
the
issues
that
business
owners
and
city
officials
are
complaining
about
syringe
exchange
programs
have
consistently
been
credited
with
decreasing
rates
of
hiv
and
hcv
per
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
naloxone
successfully
intervened
in
opioid
overdoses
between
and
it
has
also
been
shown
to
decrease
heroin
use
among
those
who
have
participated
in
a
naloxone
distribution
and
overdose
prevention
programs
despite
these
successes
the
city
just
kind
of
just
pretends
like
we
don't
exist
jones
said
they
don't
try
to
consult
with
us
kenny
beasley
who's
lived
in
the
area
being
targeted
by
injunctions
for
two
decades
and
works
at
the
harm
reduction
center
with
jones
called
the
ban
a
draconian
solution
and
pointed
out
that
supposed
economic
depreciation
of
businesses
on
the
broadway
corridor
might
be
an
exaggeration
the
brunch
line
outside
tower
cafe
is
still
going
around
the
corner
every
weekend
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
houses
in
the
affluent
neighborhood
of
land
park
just
on
the
other
side
of
broadway
are
still
selling
at
upwards
of
k
if
the
ban
is
your
only
solution
he
said
then
we're
in
for
a
world
of
hurt
