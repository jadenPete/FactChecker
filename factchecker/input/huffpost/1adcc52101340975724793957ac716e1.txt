president
donald
trump
said
wednesday
that
he
had
no
involvement
in
vice
president
mike
pence
and
u.s.
attorney
general
william
barr
using
properties
owned
by
the
trump
organization

what
can
i
tell
you
they
can't
help
it
trump
told
reporters
when
asked
about
those
officials
staying
or
hosting
events
at
his
properties
thus
funneling
money
directly
into
his
personal
coffers
trump's
comments
come
a
day
after
pence
came
under
intense
public
scrutiny
for
spending
taxpayer
money
to
stay
at
the
trump
resort
in
doonbeg
ireland
this
week
despite
the
property
being
three
hours
away
from
his
official
meetings
in
dublin
trump's
claim
that
he
wasn't
involved
in
pence's
decision
contradicts
a
tuesday
statement
from
pence's
chief
of
staff
that
trump
made
the
lodging
suggestion
but
the
vice
president's
team
offered
a
different
explanation
later
that
night
saying
it
was
solely
a
decision
by
pence's
office
so
that
he
could
enjoy
a
visit
to
his
ancestral
hometown
trump's
comments
wednesday
also
mark
the
first
time
he
distanced
himself
from
barr's
use
of
a
trump
organization
property
last
week
the
washington
post
reported
that
barr
had
booked
a
family
holiday
party
at
trump's
hotel
in
washington
a
justice
department
spokesperson
said
barr
was
paying
for
the
event
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
only
chose
the
venue
because
others
were
booked
however
the
news
reignited
concern
that
the
attorney
general's
allegiances
lie
with
the
president
not
the
country
questions
about
ways
trump
is
financially
benefiting
from
the
presidency
have
been
a
constant
throughout
his
time
in
office
currently
the
justice
department
is
defending
his
washington
hotel
against
a
lawsuit
filed
by
nearly
members
of
congress
accusing
trump
of
violating
the
constitution's
anti-corruption
emoluments
clause
by
profiting
from
his
businesses
while
in
office
