lambasted
president
donald
trump's
tepid
response
to
a
likely
hurricane
bearing
down
on
puerto
rico
in
the
coming
hours
telling
him
to
get
out
to
the
way
as
emergency
officials
prepare
for
a
storm
that
could
threaten
recovery
efforts
still
underway
more
than
a
year
after
hurricane
maria
it
seems
like
some
people
have
learned
the
lessons
of
the
past
or
are
willing
to
say
that
they
didn't
do
right
by
us
the
first
time
and
they're
trying
to
do
their
best
cruz
a
vocal
critic
of
trump
said
tuesday
night
on
cnn
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
president
of
the
united
states
we
are
not
going
to
be
concerned
by
frankly
his
behavior
his
lack
of
understanding
and
it
is
ludicrous
so
get
out
of
the
way
president
trump
and
let
people
who
can
do
the
job
get
the
job
done
in
san
juan
we
are
much
better
prepared
than
two
years
ago

from

to

for

along

the

was
fiercely
criticized
by

who
called
it
a
brazen

realdonaldtrump's
