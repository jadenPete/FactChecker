sanders
hails
volunteer
army
as
advantage
over
rivals
the
progressive
presidential
contender's
staff
and
volunteers
have
led
events
according
to
his
campaign
staff
and
volunteers
for
the
presidential
campaign
of
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
have
organized
and
hosted
over
events
including
more
than
in
california
the
campaign
announced
tuesday
evening
the
vast
majority
of
the
events
have
been
organized
by
volunteers
according
to
the
campaign
the
achievement
which
top
sanders
campaign
organizers
revealed
in
a
conference
call
with
over
supporters
reflects
what
the
sanders
campaign
sees
as
a
secret
weapon
as
it
seeks
to
stand
out
in
a
crowded
field
of
candidates
a
distributed
or
volunteer-run
organizing
system
that
it
innovated
in
the
race
and
has
since
fine-tuned
joining
the
call
with
volunteers
after
several
of
his
advisers
spoke
sanders
affirmed
that
although
the
campaign
would
engage
in
conventional
tactics
like
television
and
radio
advertisements
its
strength
was
the
devotion
of
its
supporters
many
of
whom
have
become
volunteers
we
are
going
to
win
this
campaign
because
we
are
going
to
have
the
strongest
grassroots
movement
of
any
campaign
he
said
that
is
how
we
win
this
thing
we
win
this
going
to
our
base
our
strength
of
support
the
conceit
of
distributed
organizing
which
has
its
fair
share
of
skeptics
is
that
campaigns
can
amplify
by
orders
of
magnitude
the
effect
of
the
staff
they
employ
directly
by
empowering
exceptionally
motivated
volunteers
to
run
their
own
house
parties
lead
their
own
canvasses
and
develop
and
monitor
their
own
voter
contacts
by
phone
and
text
message
it
differs
from
traditional
campaign
volunteering
in
terms
of
the
resources
and
technology
the
sanders
campaign
and
others
inspired
by
it
have
expended
on
creating
an
infrastructure
to
facilitate
the
work
of
its
most
dedicated
supporters

it
will
be
difficult
to
fully
measure
the
organizing
technique's
effectiveness
prior
to
feb
when
sanders
competes
in
iowa's
democratic
caucus
on
tuesday
evening's
call
the
campaign
said
its
staff
and
volunteers
had
made
million
calls
and
sent
million
text
messages
to
voters
in
early
states
it
also
recently
concluded
a
two-week
campus
organizing
boot
camp
or
summer
school
that
it
says
graduated
more
than
college
and
graduate
school
students
who
plan
to
serve
as
campaign
ambassadors
and
organizers
at
their
universities
a
viral
initiative
earlier
this
month
asking
sanders
supporters
to
share
on
social
media
the
life
experience
that
brought
them
to
the
campaign
dubbed
myberniestory
doubled
as
a
volunteer
recruitment
technique
the
campaign
directed
sanders
supporters
who
used
the
campaign's
organizing
app
bern
to
post
myberniestory
on
twitter
or
facebook
to
use
a
digital
tool
to
contact
several
other
voters
by
text
message
and
encourage
them
to
get
involved
in
the
campaign
the
campaign
estimates
that
it
reached
the
equivalent
number
of
voters
through
those
digitally
facilitated
connections
as
it
would
normally
reach
from
knocking
on
doors
critics
of
distributed
organizing
argue
that
it
is
no
substitute
for
the
professionally
run
field
organizing
teams
that
have
powered
successful
presidential
campaigns
and
on
that
front
sanders
got
a
later
start
than
some
of
his
rivals
beginning
hiring
field
organizers
in
the
early
states
only
in
may
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
by
contrast
already
had
staff
members
in
iowa
by
that
time
the
sanders
campaign
insists
though
that
distributed
organizing
aims
not
to
supplant
traditional
field
organizing
but
to
magnify
its
impact
it
now
has
dozens
of
paid
full-time
field
organizers
in
each
of
the
four
early
states
of
iowa
new
hampshire
nevada
and
south
carolina
as
well
as
in
california
a
super
tuesday
state
with
a
primary
open
to
all
registered
voters
the
conference
call
noted
the
campaign's
distributed
organizing
strategy
has
gone
from
identifying
and
recruiting
volunteers
to
now
putting
that
volunteer
army
to
work
more
aggressively
campaign
organizing
leaders
invited
call
participants
to
volunteer
in
real
time
to
host
a
plan
to
win
house
party
in
september
where
volunteers
will
bond
with
their
peers
and
receive
marching
orders
for
the
next
phase
of
the
campaign
the
campaign
said
it
received
commitments
from
volunteers
on
the
call
to
host
such
house
parties
the
sanders
campaign
is
hoping
to
capitalize
on
the
momentum
it
has
developed
in
recent
weeks
after
a
series
of
high-profile
policy
rollouts
and
endorsements
including
his
first
official
declaration
of
support
from
a
national
labor
union
the
sanders
campaign
which
has
tangled
bitterly
with
media
outlets
and
pollsters
for
what
it
believes
is
bias
against
the
vermont
senator
touted
a
national
poll
released
monday
that
showed
sanders
in
a
statistical
three-way
tie
for
first
place
with
warren
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
but
sanders
still
trails
biden
in
the
averages
of
polls
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
states
that
are
essential
to
his
success
his
campaign
has
argued
that
polls
which
generally
survey
a
universe
of
likely
voters
do
not
account
for
the
ways
in
which
his
campaign
is
seeking
to
turn
out
infrequent
and
new
voters
often
left
out
of
polling
at
least
one
leading
pollster
has
disputed
the
sanders
campaign's
analysis
of
the
polls
shortcomings
still
the
sanders
campaign
believes
its
success
hinges
on
reaching
those
non-traditional
voters
and
sees
its
volunteer
force
as
a
key
tool
to
do
it
we
will
win
this
election
we
will
win
the
democratic
nomination
we
will
defeat
trump
because
we
are
going
to
bring
out
people
who
in
many
cases
have
not
participated
in
politics
before
sanders
said
tuesday
evening
and
i'm
talking
about
a
generation
of
young
people
who
in
my
view
are
the
most
progressive
generation
in
the
history
of
our
country
anti-racist
anti-sexist
anti-homophobia
anti-religious
bigotry
