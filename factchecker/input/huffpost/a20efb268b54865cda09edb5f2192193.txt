schumer
called
the
trump
administration's
move
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the

and
accused
the

langley-eustis
a

the
well-being
of
american
troops
is
the
core
responsibility
of
every
commander
in

military
yet
the
commander-in-chief
is
shirking
that
duty
so
he
can
advance
his
own
political
agenda
kaine
said
defense
department
officials
have
suggested
that
the
construction
of
the

military
projects
need
not
be
delayed

backfills
and
approves
their
funding
again
in
the
near
future
but
democrats
in
the
house
and
senate
have
vowed
not
to
do
so
i'm
not
voting
to
appropriate
the
same
money
to
the
same
project
twice
because
what
they
are
doing
is
illegal
and
i'm
not
an
idiot

has
pledged
to
block

latest
effort
to
raid
military

for
his
xenophobic
