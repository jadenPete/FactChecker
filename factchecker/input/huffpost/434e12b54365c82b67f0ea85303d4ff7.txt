the

shooter
bought
his
gun
in
nevada
california
asked
its
neighbor
state
to
crack
down
on
firearms
california
has
some
of
the
country's
strictest
gun
laws
but
a
mass
shooting
at
the
gilroy
garlic
festival
last
month
has
lawmakers
looking
across
state
lines
in
hopes
of
creating
a
stronger
buffer
zone
in
a
letter
to
nevada
state
assembly
speaker
jason
frierson
d
and
his
colleagues
democratic
legislators
from
california
raised
concerns
about
the
fact
that
the
gilroy
shooter
had
bought
the
gun
used
in
the
july
attack
in
neighboring
nevada
where
it
is
easier
to
purchase
a
firearm
while
california
has
enacted
numerous
gun
safety
measures
this
tragedy
underscores
the
need
for
california
to
work
closely
with
neighboring
states
to
close
loopholes
and
advance
common
sense
gun
safety
measures
they
wrote
in
the
letter
today
we
sent
a
letter
from
ca
lawmakers
asking
the
nv
legislature
to
meet
for
a
summit
to
discuss
how
we
can
work
together

to
address
the
problem
the

lawmakers
suggested
holding
a
legislative
summit
where
leaders
from
both
states
could
discuss
avenues
for
interstate
cooperation
on
gun
safety
reform
and
serve
as
a
model
of
collaboration
for
other
states
the
gilroy
shooter's
method
of
getting
a
gun
wasn't
unusual
in
the
federal
bureau

firearms
and
explosives
traced
more
than
firearms
recovered
in
california
more
than
guns
came
from
nevada
making
the
state
the
third-most-common
point
of
origin
following
arizona
with
and
california
itself
with
nearly
the
flow
of
guns
from
states
with
loose
laws
to
states
with
strict
ones
is
a
nationwide
trend
frierson
has
not
yet
publicly
responded
to
the
letter
or
to
requests
for
comment
this
is
prime
time
for
nevada
state
to
take
up
gun
control
legislation
as
marks
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
decades
that
both
of
the
state's
legislative
chambers
and
the
governor's
office
have
all
been
under
democratic
control
