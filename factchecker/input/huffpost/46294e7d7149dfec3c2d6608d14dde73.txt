president
donald
trump
early
saturday
lashed
out
on
twitter
at
two
reporters
from
the
washington
post
who
he
said
shouldn't
even
be
allowed
on
the
grounds
of
the
white
house
trump
called
philip
rucker
and
ashley
parker
two
nasty
lightweight
reporters
in
response
to
their
story
published
last
weekend
titled
trump's
lost
summer
aides
claim
victory
but
others
see
incompetence
and
intolerance
the
post's
piece
centered
on
what
some
white
house
aides
and
trump
allies
believed
were
a
series
of
opportunities
that
trump
had
missed
over
the
last
couple
of
months
part
of
it
read
the
white
house
hit
back
via
its
official
twitter
feed
on
tuesday
with
this
video
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
and
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
have
also
published
an
essay
titled
the
washington
post's
lost
summer
in
which
they
accused
the
newspaper
of
ignoring
many
of
the
administration's
accomplishments
the
truth
is
trump
racked
up
many
well-documented
victories
that
directly
benefited
the
american
people
at
home
and
abroad
they
wrote
when
the
post
asked
the
white
house
proudly
provided
it
with
a
detailed
list
of
the
administration's
most
important
successes
of
the
summer
of
those
accomplishments
the
post
chose
to
publish
just
four
which
it
buried
under
paragraphs
of
editorialized
critique
the
post
denied
the
allegation
however
as
subscribers
are
probably
aware
the
post
did
not
take
the
summer
off
its
national
correspondent
philip
bump
wrote
in
a
piece
published
wednesday
and
then
shared
again
friday
in
fact
we
covered
each
of
the
major
stories
included
in
the
video
package
it's
just
that
outside
the
white
house
those
individual
accomplishments
aren't
really
a
powerful
counterweight
to
the
self-inflicted
wounds
trump's
presidency
has
suffered
since
the
beginning
of
july
he
added
most
of
those
wins
in
fact
are
either
executive
orders
making
incremental
changes
achievements
that
happened
before
the
summer
or
announced
changes
that
exist
in
limbo
