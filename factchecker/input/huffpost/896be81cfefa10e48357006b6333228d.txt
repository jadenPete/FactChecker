the

said
robert
brulle
a
brown
university
researcher
who
tracks
climate
denial
and
political
influence
at
green
groups
we
need
to
put
additional
scrutiny
on
these
board
members
to
see
if
they
are
legitimately
representing
the
public
interest
or
if
they're
on
there
to
represent
their
own
particular
vested
interests
brulle
said
by
phone
that's
the
real
question
for
these
people
it's
a
question
wri's
founder
seems
to
have
grappled
with
before

essay
in

gustave
speth
the

lawyer

against

wealthy
class's
influence
on
politics
and
called
for
we
as
citizens
to
mobilize
our
spiritual
and
political
resources
for
transformative
change
we
are
seeing
the
emergence
of
a
vicious
circle
income
disparities
shift
political
access
and
influence
to
wealthy
constituencies
and
large
businesses
which
further
imperils
the
potential
of
the
democratic
process
to
act
to
correct
the
economic
disparities
he
wrote
concluding
today's
politics
will
never
deliver
environmental
sustainability
