jon
ossoff
is
leaning
toward
running
for
u.s.
senate
in
georgia
which
would
give
democrats
a
candidate
with
significant
fundraising
power
in
ossoff's
plans
were
shared
with
huffpost
by
a
democrat
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
recent
weeks
and
were
reported
by
buzzfeed
on
wednesday
as
well
there
are
already
three
democrats
in
the
race
to
unseat
sen
david
perdue
r
former
columbus
mayor
teresa
tomlinson
clarkston
mayor
ted
terry
and
lieutenant
governor
candidate
sarah
riggs
amico
but
the
political
landscape
in
georgia
was
shaken
up
on
wednesday
when
sen
johnny
isakson
r-ga
announced
his
resignation
the
governor
has
the
power
to
name
a
replacement
and
a
special
election
will
take
place

meaning
there
will
be
two
senate
seats

ossoff
a
year-old
former
congressional
staffer
attracted
national
attention
when
he
ran
in
the
special
election
for
georgia's
th
congressional
district
which
became
the
most
expensive
house
race
in
history
although
it's
since
been
eclipsed
ossoff
also
shattered
fundraising
records
at
the
time
and
could
tap
into
his
large
network
for
his
senate
bid
he
lost
to
republican
karen
handel
although
he
helped
make
the
solidly
red
seat
competitive
and
produced
probably
the
strongest
democratic
turnout
in
an
off-year
election
in
at
least
a
decade
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
race
also
gave
democrats
one
of
their
first
signs
that
president
donald
trump
was
hurting
the
gop
in
suburban
districts
which
then
played
out
in
the
election
as
well
but
ossoff's
race
was
also
widely
watched
for
what
went
wrong
democrats
nationwide
threw
their
support
and
money
to
ossoff
which
made
it
easier
for
the
gop
to
portray
him
as
a
puppet
for
party
leaders
in
washington
although
he
grew
up
in
the
th
district
he
was
living
just
outside
it
at
the
time
and
many
progressives
believed
his
traditional
centrist
campaign
and
message
did
him
in
reflecting
a
longtime
reluctance
of
the
party
to
endorse
outspoken
progressives
as
general
election
candidates
democrats
in
the
state
now
have
to
consider
whether
to
take
on
a
sitting
senator
or
challenge
someone
who
will
likely
have
a
shorter
track
record
stacey
abrams
who
narrowly
lost
the
gubernatorial
race
in
ruled
out
running
on
wednesday
but
with
two
seats
open
other
big
names
could
emerge
in
the
coming
weeks
