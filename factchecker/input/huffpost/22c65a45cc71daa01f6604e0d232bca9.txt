sending
millions
from
disaster
relief
fund
to
southern
border
the
administration
intends
to
redirect
millions
from
agencies
like
fema
and
the
coast
guard
to
finance
its
efforts
along
the
u.s.
mexico
border
president
donald
trump's
administration
is
set
to
pull
million
from
the
department
of
homeland
security
including
million
allocated
for
the
federal
emergency
management
agency's
disaster
relief
fund
to
pay
for
immigrant
detention
space
and
temporary
hearing
locations
for
asylum-seekers
forced
to
wait
in
mexico
multiple
news
outlets
reported
tuesday
these
funds
would
reportedly
allow
the
government
to
fund
nearly
additional
beds
for
immigrant
detainees
the
move
comes
after
congress
declined
the
administration's
request
to
include
additional
funding
for
its
border
security
measures
in
a
disaster
relief
bill
passed
in
june
according
to
nbc
news
the
trump
administration
believes
it
has
the
authority
to
reallocate
these
funds
in
lieu
of
congressional
approval
the
announcement
comes
at
a
precarious
time
as
hurricane
season
is
ratcheting
up
and
puerto
rico
is
bracing
for
tropical
storm
dorian
on
tuesday
night
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
condemned
trump's
fund
diversion
effort
describing
it
as
brazen
theft
the
president's
brazen
assault
on
the
congress's
most
fundamental
constitutional
power
the
power
of
the
purse
is
cruel
deeply
dangerous
and
made
in
bad
faith
she
said
in
a
statement
stealing
from
appropriated
funds
is
always
unacceptable
but
to
pick
the
pockets
of
disaster
relief
funding
in
order
to
fund
an
appalling
inhumane
family
incarceration
plan
is
staggering
and
to
do
so
on
the
eve
of
hurricane
season
is
stunningly
reckless
trump
has
repeatedly
shown
a
desire
to
spend
disaster
relief
funds
as
he
chooses
in
reports
alleged
the
president
had
been
advocating
the
end
of
disaster
relief
funding
for
puerto
rico
as
the
commonwealth
recovered
from
hurricane
maria
the
administration's
latest
proposal
for
disaster
relief
funding
would
result
in
the
u.s.
coast
guard
losing
million
originally
allocated
for
aviation
security
and
other
coast
guard
operations
according
to
officials
the
trump
administration
is
expected
to
reallocate
million
originally
intended
for
fema
to
instead
erect
more
temporary
hearing
locations
outside
the
u.s.
where
the
administration
prefers
asylum-seekers
await
the
outcomes
of
their
cases
the
american
civil
liberties
union
responded
to
the
report
tuesday
afternoon
by
assailing
dhs
s
reckless
disregard
for
constitutional
checks
and
balances
and
calling
on
congress
to
restrict
the
agency's
ability
to
manipulate
the
budget
process
barring
legal
proceedings
officials
say
the
transfer
of
funds
is
expected
to
occur
immediately
