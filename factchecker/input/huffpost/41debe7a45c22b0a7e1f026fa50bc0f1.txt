trump
claims
there
could
be
legal
consequences
for
former
staffers
the
president
said
he
doesn't
think
there
will
be
a
reason
to
take
action
against
his
former
personal
assistant
madeleine
westerhout
though
he
made
no
assurances
in
the
wake
of
his
personal
assistant's
resignation
president
donald
trump
on
saturday
emphasized
that
he
could
hold
former
staffers
legally
accountable
for
breaking
their
nondisclosure
agreements
while
madeleine
westerhout
has
a
fully
enforceable
confidentiality
agreement
she
is
a
very
good
person
and
i
don't
think
there
would
ever
be
a
reason
to
use
it
he
tweeted
referring
to
the
year-old
who
stepped
down
from
her
post
on
thursday
westerhout
left
the
administration
after
allegedly
dishing
out
personal
details
about
the
first
family
at
an
off-the-record
dinner
with
journalists
in
bedminster
new
jersey
after
a
couple
of
rounds
of
drinks
according
to
politico
among
westerhout's
claims
were
that
the
president
is
incapable
of
recognizing
daughter
tiffany
trump
in
a
crowd
and
that
he
does
not
like
being
photographed
with
her
because
he
feels
she
is
overweight
however
trump
appeared
to
push
back
on
that
narrative
saturday
declaring
i
love
tiffany
doing
great
he
also
noted
that
westerhout
had
called
him
to
apologize
and
said
she
had
a
bad
night
continuing
the
president
then
announced
he
is
suing
former
white
house
aide
omarosa
manigault
newman
who
exited
his
administration
in
and
has
since
written
a
new
york
times
bestseller
called
unhinged
in
which
she
is
intensely
critical
of
trump
following
her
departure
manigault
newman
revealed
that
she
had
taped
private
white
house
discussions
bragged
about
her
stash
of
recordings
and
slowly
released
a
small
handful
to
the
public
according
to
the
times
she
may
have
up
to
audio
files
yes
i
am
currently
suing
various
people
for
violating
their
confidentiality
agreements
trump
wrote
disgusting
and
foul
mouthed
omarosa
is
one
i
gave
her
every
break
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
despised
by
everyone
and
she
went
for
some
cheap
money
from
a
book
numerous
others
also
manigault
newman
isn't
the
only
former
staffer
to
have
written
a
supposed
tell-all
on
the
inner
workings
of
the
trump
administration
former
white
house
press
secretary
sean
spicer
and
former
aide
cliff
sims
have
also
penned
their
own
books
along
with
two
ex-fbi
officials
the
agency's
former
director
james
comey
and
former
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
though
having
white
house
employees
sign
ndas
is
not
unprecedented
such
agreements
are
more
commonly
used
by
private
employers
rather
than
by
publicly
funded
government
bodies
however
trump
has
made
them
a
requirement
for
many
of
his
hires
one
of
the
documents
obtained
by
the
associated
press
forbids
staffers
from
releasing
information
of
a
private
proprietary
or
confidential
nature
or
that
mr
trump
insists
remain
private
or
confidential
the
agreement
applies
to
the
duration
of
employment
as
well
as
to
all
times
thereafter
