r
released
a
series
of
executive
orders
on
thursday
in
response
to
two
recent
mass

in
the
state
and
none
of
them
address
gun
control
the
republican
governor
an
avid
gun-rights
advocate
issued
eight
orders
including
one
requiring
the
department
of
public
safety
to
develop
guidance
for
how
law
enforcement
agencies
should
submit
reports
on
suspicious
activity
another
aimed
to
create
an
awareness-raising
initiative
for
the

to
be
more
likely
to
report
information
about
potential
gunmen
in
his
announcement
the
governor
acknowledged
that
more
must
be
done
and
said
he
would
work
expeditiously
with
lawmakers
on
laws
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
criminals
while
safeguarding
the
nd
amendment
rights
of
law-abiding
texans
it
is
unclear
what
legislative
measures
abbott
plans
to
push
huffpost
reached
out
to
abbott
for
comment
but
did
not
immediately
receive
a
response
as
of
this
month
it
is
now
even
easier
to
carry
guns
in
texas
churches
schools
and
more
due
to
several
bills
passed
by
texas
lawmakers
in
may
and
later
signed
by
abbott
which
loosened
the
state's
already
lenient
restrictions
on
guns
the
national
rifle
association
which
has
given
abbott
an
a
rating
for
being
pro-gun
praised
the
recent
bills
as
nra-supported
legislation
presidential
candidate
and
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
d-texas
who
has
issued
policy
plans
and
emotional
pleas
for
gun
control
after
the
mass
shootings
in
his
home
state
was
quick
to
point
out
what
was
missing
from
abbott's
executive
action
plan
in
recent
years
the
state
has
seen
several
high-profile
mass
shootings
on
its
soil
including
a
school
shooting
in
santa
fe
that
left
people
dead
and
a
church
shooting
near
san
antonio
that
left
people
dead
half
of
whom
were
children
last
month
a
white
man
shot
and
killed
people
with
an
ar-style
weapon
in
el
paso
texas
after
posting
a
racist
anti-immigrant
manifesto
railing
against
a
hispanic
invasion
of
the
state
and
over
labor
day
weekend
a
white
male
suspect
shot
and
killed
seven
people
with
an
ar-style
weapon
in
a
shooting
spree
in
odessa
texas
in
other
states
governors
have
used
their
executive
powers
to
take
action
on
guns
in
the
past
in
august
pennsylvania
gov
tom
wolf
d
announced
an
executive
order
on
guns
including
increasing
data
sharing
across
law
enforcement
agencies
expanding
the
state's
gun
buyback
program
and
increasing
surveillance
on
hate
groups
to
prevent
mass
shootings
wolf
also
called
on
legislators
to
mandate
universal
background
checks
on
all
gun
purchases
in
north
carolina
gov
roy
cooper
d
signed
an
executive
directive
on
guns
last
month
including
strengthening
background
checks
by
increasing
data
sharing
between
the
state
and
the
federal
background
check
system
under
current
texas
laws
legal
gun
owners
don't
need
an
additional
permit
to
carry
long
guns
like
the
ones
used
in
the
el
paso
and
odessa
shootings
in
unrestricted
public
areas
there
is
also
no
background
check
requirement
for
private
sales
a
loophole
through
which
the
odessa
shooter
who
had
failed
a
background
check
was
able
to
buy
the
gun
he
used
