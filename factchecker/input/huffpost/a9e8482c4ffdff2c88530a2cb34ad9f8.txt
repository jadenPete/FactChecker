as
hurricane
dorian
barreled
down
on
puerto
rico
on
wednesday
trump
tweeted
a
series
of
attacks
against
its
officials
and
called
it
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
in
some
people
died
when
hurricane
maria
hit
puerto
rico
the
devastating
storm
was
worsened
by
fema's
multiple
failures
as
the
agency
itself
concluded
last
year
yet
trump
has
repeatedly
defended
his
administration's
response
and
attacked
the
island
and
on
wednesday
ocasio-cortez
had
had
enough
americans
died
on
your
watch
you're
not
the
best
thing
to
happen
to
anybody
but
yourself
and
even
that's
questionable

let
me
get
this
straight
a
hurricane
could
be
bearing
down
on
puertorico
that
could
cause
unknown
death
and
destruction
yet
this
is
the
mindset
of
realdonaldtrump
towards
his
fellow
citizens
this
is
not
right

i've
never
seen
someone
go
so
quickly
from
blaming
the
victims
of
hurricanes
to
patting
himself
