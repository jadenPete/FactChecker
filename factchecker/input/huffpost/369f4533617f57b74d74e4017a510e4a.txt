migrants
imprisoned
after
mississippi
ice
raid
get
little
mercy
in
court
the
trump
administration
wants
to
imprison
more
than
workers
swept
up
in
a
sprawling
ice
raid
before
sending
them
to
immigration
court
jackson
miss
she'd
lived
in
the
united
states
for
years
an
ice
agent
acknowledged
she
posed
no
security
risk
she
regularly
attended
her
local
baptist
church
and
her
year-old
son
was
a
u.s.
citizen
but
magistrate
judge
linda
anderson
rejected
the
guatemalan
migrant's
request
for
release
on
bond
citing
the
woman's
alleged
use
of
an
alias
and
a
lack
of
witnesses
to
testify
to
her
community
ties
the
decision
left
her
son
sobbing
outside
the
courtroom
immigration

customs
enforcement
arrested
workers
in
mississippi
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
in
the
largest
single-state
operation
in
the
agency's
year
history
charges
for
the
employers
have
yet
to
be
filed
but
the
operation
wrenched
many
low-paid
poultry
workers
away
from
their
children
at
least
one
of
the
workers
was
still
breastfeeding
when
she
was
detained
ice
insists
that
the
operation
aimed
to
build
a
criminal
case
against
employers
who
systematically
contracted
unauthorized
workers
at
seven
poultry
processors
across
the
state
but
instead
of
cultivating
the
workers
as
sources
of
information
the
trump
administration
is
prosecuting
dozens
of
them
largely
under
criminal
immigration
laws
that
several
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
pledged
to
repeal
most
of
the
workers
face
the
charge
of
illegal
reentry
michael
hurst
u.s.
attorney
for
southern
mississippi
charged
others
with
misuse
of
social
security
numbers
impersonating
u.s.
citizens
and
other
identity
crimes
allegedly
committed
to
gain
employment
without
legal
immigration
status
those
charges
could
make
felons
out
of
workers
whose
alleged
actions
differ
little
from
those
of
people
who
face
deportation
proceedings
in
immigration
court
alone
the
mass
prosecution
of
migrant
poultry
workers
has
logjammed
the
federal
court
in
jackson
which
is
unaccustomed
to
processing
multiple
simultaneous
cases
requiring
translation
often
in
indigenous
languages
like
mam
and
chuj
court-appointed
lawyers
saddled
with
several
cases
at
once
often
struggled
to
locate
their
clients
ahead
of
their
first
appearances
before
a
judge
this
week
or
to
round
up
witnesses
to
vouch
for
their
community
ties
anderson
the
magistrate
judge
released
one
woman
on
an
unsecured
bond
of
prosecutors
accuse
the
woman
a
mexican
national
of
returning
to
the
united
states
after
a
deportation
in
the
woman
first
came
to
mississippi
three
decades
ago
avoided
problems
with
the
law
and
raised
a
family
including
lawfully
present
children
according
to
her
defender
john
weber
she
worked
for
the
last
years
at
a
peco
foods
poultry
plant
in
canton
mississippi
before
her
arrest
on
aug
we
had
just
a
ton
of
information
for
the
court
to
show
substantial
connections
to
the
community
weber
told
huffpost
it
was
pretty
overwhelming
cases
of
migrants
with
strong
family
ties
to
the
united
states
and
no
criminal
records
usually
move
through
immigration
court
but
prosecutors
have
the
power
to
slap
such
people
with
felony
charges
if
they
choose
and
three
months
after
president
donald
trump
took
office
his
administration
encouraged
all
federal
districts
to
do
so
as
often
as
possible
the
woman
who
won
release
was
the
exception
most
of
the
other
workers
facing
prosecution
on
criminal
immigration
charges
who
appeared
in
court
shackled
at
the
hands
and
ankles
will
remain
locked
up
the
judge
said
she
may
consider
releasing
some
of
them
on
bond
in
the
future
prosecutors
argue
that
the
migrants
will
flee
if
released
one
of
the
defenders
tom
rich
questioned
that
logic
pointing
to
his
clients
histories
of
returning
to
the
u.s.
it
seems
that
he's
made
every
effort
in
the
past
to
be
here
rich
said
referring
to
a
guatemalan
client
with
a
wife
in
mississippi
in
one
case
a
government
attorney
argued
that
releasing
a
woman
from
criminal
custody
on
bond
might
make
it
possible
for
ice
to
deport
her
before
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
could
convict
and
imprison
her
for
felony
reentry
in
another
court-appointed
defender
brad
mills
took
the
unusual
step
of
calling
his
client
to
the
stand
to
testify
on
his
own
behalf
the
man
began
weeping
as
mills
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
and
asked
him
what
it
was
it's
the
deed
to
my
house
the
man
said
via
a
translator
the
man
was
married
with
two
children
owned
his
home
outright
and
had
paid
his
property
taxes
ahead
of
time
but
the
lawyer
had
not
been
able
to
reach
his
immediate
family
in
time
for
the
hearing
anderson
left
the
man's
bond
decision
pending
until
next
week
mills
hoped
the
judge
would
release
his
client
who
he
pointed
out
had
no
criminal
record
he
questioned
why
the
prosecutors
didn't
set
their
sights
higher
it's
easier
to
go
after
the
low-hanging
fruit
and
that's
the
workers
mills
told
huffpost
going
after
the
employers
is
an
afterthought
correction
