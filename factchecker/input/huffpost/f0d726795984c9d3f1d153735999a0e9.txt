but
his
tweets
did
not
go
over
well
people
accused
cruz
of
participating
in
phony
patriotism
and
of
being
complicit
with
president
donald
trump's
administration
which
they
said
eschewed
many
of
the
values
that
king
had
stood
for
and
yet
you
have
allowed
a
racist
to
become
potus
you
have
so
much
to
be
proud
of
mad

how
dare
you
cite
the
words
of
dr
king
when
you
support
trump
who
doesn't
believe
in
any
of
what
king
said
you
stand

the
proud

with

it's
years

and
you're
still
not
listening
if
king
were
alive
today
he'd
be
kneeling
during
the
national
anthem
and
you'd
be
ripping
him
for
doing
so
stop
patronizing
us
with
phony
patriotism
resistance
is
not
futile
it's
necessary
