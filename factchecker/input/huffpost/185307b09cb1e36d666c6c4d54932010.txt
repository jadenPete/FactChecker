trump
doesn't
know
whether
he's
ever
heard
of
a
category
storm
hurricane
dorian
is
the
fourth
storm
of
that
magnitude
to
develop
during
his
presidency
as
hurricane
dorian
hurtled
toward
the
u.s.
coastline
on
sunday
president
donald
trump
expressed
shock
over
its
category
status
claiming
to
be
unsure
of
whether
he
had
heard
of
such
a
term
despite
the
fact
that
it's
the
fourth
storm
of
that
magnitude
to
develop
during
his
tenure
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
ever
even
heard
of
a
category
he
told
federal
emergency
management
agency
officials
i
knew
it
existed
and
i've
seen
some
category
s
you
don't
even
see
them
that
much
but
a
category
is
something
that
i
don't
know
that
i've
ever
even
heard
the
term
other
than
i
know
it's
there
that's
the
ultimate
and
that's
what
we
have
unfortunately
in
september
hurricane
irma
slammed
the
florida
keys
as
a
category
storm
having
weakened
from
category
as
it
approached
that
same
month
hurricane
maria
which
was
also
initially
ranked
category
hit
puerto
rico
as
a
category
storm
leaving
behind
damage
from
which
the
island
has
yet
to
fully
recover
as
it
waits
on
further
disaster
relief
funding
from
congress
in
october
hurricane
michael
became
the
first
category
storm
to
strike
the
country
since
however
this
isn't
the
first
time
trump's
memory
has
apparently
short-circuited
on
two
separate
occasions
in
september
the
president
said
he
never
even
knew
a
category
existed
and
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
anything
like
that
the
following
month
he
erroneously
claimed
that
throughout
history
a
storm
of
that
intensity
had
never
hit
land
in
may
of
this
year
he
again
said
he
hadn't
heard
of
a
category
storm
calling
it
big
stuff
dorian
is
expected
to
begin
moving
along
the
florida
coast
on
tuesday
