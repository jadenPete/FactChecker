trump
says
he
was
joking
when
he
called
himself
the
chosen
one
the
president
suggested
on
wednesday
that
his
escalating
trade
war
with
china
was
preordained
by
god
three
days
after
looking
to
the
sky
and
proclaiming
himself
the
chosen
one
in
his
escalating
trade
war
with
china
president
donald
trump
is
backpedaling
on
the
assertion
downplaying
it
as
a
joke
in
a
pair
of
tweets
saturday
trump
complained
about
media
coverage
of
the
statement
claiming
that
the
press
knew
i
was
kidding
being
sarcastic
and
just
having
fun
and
chose
to
misconstrue
the
remark
i
was
smiling
as
i
looked
up
and
around
he
added
though
footage
of
his
wednesday
press
conference
does
not
in
fact
show
him
smiling
as
he
made
the
comment
the
many
reporters
with
me
were
smiling
also
they
knew
the
truth
continuing
the
president
alleged
it
was
fake
news
and
was
apparently
irked
that
the
media
took
seriously
what
he
said
in
a
presidential
briefing
outside
the
white
house
having
fun
i
was
smiling
as
i
looked
up
and
around
the
many
reporters
with
me
were
smiling
also
they
knew
the
truth
and
yet
when
i
saw
the
reporting
cnn
msnbc
and
other
fake
news
outlets
covered
it
as
serious
news
me
thinking
of
myself
as
the
messiah
no
more
