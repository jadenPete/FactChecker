anymore
trump
for
years
has
enjoyed
a
symbiotic
relationship
with
the
conservative
news
network

talking
points
flowing

sees
something

doesn't
like

publicly
lambasts
the

demands
that
it
change
its
messaging
to
cater
to
his
tastes

this
case

became
irate
after
hinojosa
was
allowed
to
say
things
like
if
you're
looking
at
recent
polling
most
of
the
top-polling
candidates
head-to-head
would
beat
donald

especially
in
those
battleground
states
rather
than
berate
hinojosa
smith
engaged
in
a
normal
back
and
forth
conversation
about
the
debates
for
trump
smiling
and
giggling
with
