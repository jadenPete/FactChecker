vice
president
mike
pence
has
weighed
in
on
a
lawsuit
over
the
constitutionality
of
displaying
a
bible
at
a
new
hampshire
veterans
hospital
promising
his
supporters
the
bible
stays
pence's
declaration
in
support
of
the
religious
display
at
the
hospital
received
a
standing
ovation
at
the
american
legion's
national
convention
in
indianapolis
on
wednesday
perhaps
the
biggest
applause
of
the
night
according
to
the
indy
star
the
former
indiana
governor
was
referring
to
a
display
at
the
manchester
va
medical
center
that
features
a
bible
carried
by
a
prisoner
of
war
during
world
war
ii
the
bible
is
part
of
a
traditional
table
memorial
to
missing
veterans
and
pows
located
at
the
hospital's
entrance
the
historic
bible
became
the
subject
of
a
federal
lawsuit
filed
in
may
a
u.s.
air
force
veteran
claimed
its
presence
violated
the
constitution's
establishment
clause
which
stipulates
that
the
government
can't
promote
any
specific
religion
the
military
religious
freedom
foundation
which
seeks
to
prevent
the
united
states
armed
forces
from
showing
favoritism
toward
any
religion
also
denounced
the
display
during
his
speech
pence
claimed
that
under
former
president
barack
obama's
administration
va
hospitals
were
removing
bibles
and
even
banning
christmas
carols
in
an
effort
to
be
politically
correct
there
were
several
instances
of
christian
religious
displays
being
removed
or
covered
at
va
medical
centers
during
the
obama
administration
including
in
michigan
ohio
and
pennsylvania
and
in
student
volunteers
were
prohibited
from
singing
christmas
carols
with
religious
themes
at
a
va
hospital
in
georgia
however
these
removals
were
directives
from
local
staff
and
not
from
the
obama
administration
according
to
cnn
some
of
these
decisions
were
also
reversed
in
response
to
pushback
from
christians
including
the
ban
on
christian
christmas
songs
pence
told
the
audience
that
under
this
administration
va
hospitals
will
not
be
religion-free
zones
we
will
always
respect
the
freedom
of
religion
of
every
veteran
of
every
faith
he
said
and
my
message
to
the
new
hampshire
va
hospital
is
the
bible
stays
the
vice
president's
stance
earned
praise
from
franklin
graham
a
steadfast
evangelical
supporter
of
president
donald
trump
i
appreciate
your
boldness
vice
president

on

thursday
we
are
grateful
to
you
and
president
donald
j.
trump
for
consistently
defending
our
religious
freedoms
mikey
weinstein
founder
of
the
military
religious
freedom
foundation
reacted
to
pence's
comments
by
calling
the
vice
president
one
of
the
most
repulsive
and
repellent
fundamentalist
christian
supremacists
and
bullies
on
the
scene
today
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
he
is
lending
his
ugly
bigotry
and
pervasive
prejudice
in
support
of
keeping
that
christian
bible
bolted
down
on
that
pow

table
at
the

center
