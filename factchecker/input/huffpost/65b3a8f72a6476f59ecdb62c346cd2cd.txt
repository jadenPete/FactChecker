school
district
secession
is
segregation
by
another
name
communities
around
the
country
are
creating
new
whiter
districts
when
penn
state
university
professor
erica
frankenberg
graduated
from
high
school
in
alabama
there
was
only
one
school
district
in
mobile
county
now
over
years
later
it
is
one
of
four
districts
in
the
past
decade
three
communities
have
splintered
off
to
create
their
own
districts
and
in
doing
so
they
have
exacerbated
segregation
in
the
area
the
process
is
called
school
district
secession
around
the
country
it's
changing
the
nature
of
school
segregation
a
new
study
conducted
by
frankenberg
virginia
commonwealth
university
professor
genevieve
siege-hawley
and
researcher
kendra
taylor
looks
at
school
secessions
in
the
south
with
an
eye
on
how
new
school
district
boundaries
affect
patterns
of
school
and
residential
segregation
the
study
which
looks
specifically
at
seven
counties
in
the
south
where
new
districts
have
formed
since
found
that
the
practice
increasingly
sorts
students
into
separate
districts
by
race
thirty
states
allow
for
school
district
secessions
according
to
the
nonprofit
edbuild
but
only
six
are
required
to
look
at
the
socioeconomic
and
racial
effects
of
these
decisions
from
to
communities
across
the
country
have
successfully
broken
off
from
a
larger
district
to
form
their
own
communities
often
secede
from
large
integrated
districts
to
create
white
enclaves
in
the
name
of
neutral-sounding
causes
like
local
control
said
frankenberg
new
districts
tend
to
be
whiter
and
more
affluent
than
the
ones
they
leave
behind
in
the
study's
seven
districts
school
district
boundaries
accounted
for
an
average
of
about
of
the
school
segregation
of
black
and
white
students
in
but
by
this
number
had
increased
to
about
the
remaining
can
be
attributed
to
school
segregation
within
a
district
the
relationship
between
residential
segregation
and
school
secession
however
was
less
clear
at
least
in
the
short
term
researchers
did
find
evidence
though
that
it
could
have
a
longer-term
effect
where
you
have
enclaves
that
can
drive
residential
decision-making
said
frankenberg
also
school
district
boundaries
act
as
a
sort
of
political
and
social
boundary
it
can
carry
social
meaning
secession
has
occurred
in
school
systems
where
white
students
are
in
the
minority
accounting
for
about
of
all
students
on
average
and
where
public
school
enrollment
is
increasingly
non-white
through
the
creation
of
new
boundary
lines
secession
becomes
a
political
mechanism
for
disproportionately
white
communities
to
maintain
a
relative
advantage
in
terms
of
student
composition
and
likely
financial
resources
given
the
funding
gaps
between
predominantly
minority
and
predominantly
white
districts
says
the
study
in
mobile
county
where
frankenberg
went
to
school
between-district
segregation
increased
from
about
to
about
from
to
these
secessions
have
gained
widespread
media
attention
in
places
like
gardendale
alabama
where
discussions
about
race
have
been
at
the
forefront
a
federal
appeals
court
there
found
that
the
community
couldn't
start
its
own
school
system
amid
clear
evidence
that
the
attempted
split
was
racially
motivated
still
this
study
was
the
first
to
uncover
the
systemic
effect
of
new
school
district
boundaries
caused
by
secession
