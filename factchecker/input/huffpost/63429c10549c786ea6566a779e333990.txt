sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
on
tuesday
pointed
to
global
warming
as
a
major
cause
of
hurricane
dorian
which
has
pummeled
the
bahamas
with
devastating
winds
and
massive
flooding
and
is
slowly
churning
toward
the
coast
of
florida
in
a
tweet
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
slammed
the
fossil
fuel
industry
for
wreaking
havoc
on
the
environment
arguing
that
it
creates
death
and
destruction
then
spends
billions
denying
its
responsibility
let
us
be
clear
hurricane
dorian
has
everything
to
do
with
climate
change
which
is
the
existential
crisis
of
our
time
he
added
sanders
remarks
were
spurred
by
a
new
york
times
op-ed
on
worsening
hurricanes
which
was
shared
by
the
new
consensus
a
liberal
think
tank
helping
to
develop
the
green
new
deal
sander's
is
a
co-sponsor
of
a
version
of
the
green
new
deal
which
proposes
a
broad
range
of
environmental
and
economic
initiatives
and
has
been
closely
linked

as
of
tuesday
dorian
had
wound
down
from
a
category
storm
to
a
category
it
was
initially
able
to
gain
significant
force
by
feeding
on
warm
ocean
waters
though
it
may
be
too
early
to
determine
the
exact
impact
of
climate
change
on
the
hurricane's
development
the
warming
of
the
planet's
oceans
seems
to
have
fueled
upticks
in
the
intensity
of
hurricanes
according
to
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
more
than
of
earth's
warming
over
the
last
years
has
occurred
in
the
planet's
oceans
where
heat
is
absorbed
much
more
readily
than
on
land
the
national
climate
assessment
published
by
the
federally
mandated
u.s.
global
change
research
program
pointed
to
the
rise
in
greenhouse
gasses
as
a
contributing
factor
in
triggering
hurricane
activity
in
the
atlantic
ocean
region
it
also
attributed
the
intensity
of
the
atlantic
hurricane
season
to
a
combination
of
natural
and
human-caused
elements
that
year's
hurricanes
included
harvey
irma
jose
and
maria
each
of
which
reached
category
or
intensity
