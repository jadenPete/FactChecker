court
denies
democrats
motion
to
hurry
trump
tax
return
case
among
other
reasons
the
judge
is
considering
whether
to
add
a
trump
supporter
from
utah
to
the
case
a
federal
judge
has
denied
congressional
democrats
request
to
speed
up
their
case
seeking
copies
of
president
donald
trump's
personal
tax
returns
from
the
internal
revenue
service
thursday's
decision
by
u.s.
district
judge
trevor
mcfadden
makes
it
less
likely
that
democrats
will
win
their
lawsuit
before
november
though
nobody
knows
for
sure
how
long
the
district
court
case
and
subsequent
appeals
might
take
the
american
public
has
seen
the
tax
returns
of
every
president
from
richard
nixon
through
barack
obama
trump
has
offered
a
series
of
shifting
justifications
for
keeping
his
private
including
that
he's
been
under
audit
and
that
people
wouldn't
understand
them
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
sought
access
to
the
president's
returns
under
a
federal
disclosure
law
but
the
trump
administration
blocked
its
request
in
an
unprecedented
move
democrats
sued
in
july
and
then
last
week
asked
the
court
to
hurry
the
case
but
trump's
lawyers
argued
that
the
lawsuit
raises
too
many
questions
about
the
separation
of
powers
between
congress
the
executive
branch
and
the
judiciary
for
the
court
to
rush
and
judge
mcfadden
agreed
mcfadden
a
trump
appointee
wrote
in
his
order
thursday
that
the
weighty
constitutional
issues
and
political
ramifications
it
presents
militate
in
favor
of
caution
and
deliberation
not
haste
and
there's
another
reason
mcfadden
wants
to
wait
duane
morley
cox
an
year-old
trump
supporter
who
has
been
filing
motions
to
intervene
in
this
case
and
several
others
from
logan
utah
allowing
this
case
to
proceed
could
distract
the
president
from
his
official
duties
cox
argued
in
a
brief
filed
in
july
if
democrats
had
obtained
the
tax
returns
and
were
asking
questions
about
them
back
in
june
he
suggested
trump
might
have
been
too
distracted
to
reconsider
a
retaliatory
attack
on
iran
but
then
the
iranians
might
have
escalated
matters
cox
wrote
and
we
could
today
be
in
a
military
situation
which
affected
oil
deliveries
throughout
the
world
and
resulting
military
consequences
with
their
attendant
negative
impact
upon
the
economies
of
many
nations
including
the
united
states
trump's
team
has
already
told
the
judge
that
it
doesn't
want
cox's
help
and
doesn't
think
he
has
standing
to
intervene
but
mcfadden
still
cited
cox
as
a
reason
to
not
speed
up
the
case
noting
that
the
ways
and
means
committee
had
taken
no
position
on
whether
mr
cox
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
and
that
he
hadn't
made
up
his
mind
either
the
tax
return
lawsuit
is
one
of
several
cases
stemming
from
the
administration's
refusal
to
provide
testimony
or
documents
in
response
to
more
than
a
dozen
subpoenas
from
house
committees
another
of
those
suits
in
which
democrats
are
seeking
trump's
personal
financial
records
from
deutsche
bank
might
also
yield
some
tax
information
mcfadden's
order
means
that
democrats
will
have
to
rebut
arguments
that
the
court
shouldn't
even
hear
the
matter
as
well
as
arguments
about
the
merits
of
their
case
which
turns
on
the
clear
language
of
a
tax
code
provision
known
as
section
the
law
says
that
in
response
to
a
request
from
a
tax
committee
like
ways
and
means
the
treasury
secretary
shall
furnish
such
committee
with
any
return
or
return
information
specified
in
such
request
trump's
lawyers
say
democrats
have
no
legitimate
legislative
reason
for
their
request
and
just
want
to
embarrass
the
president
democrats
argue
that
they're
conducting
legitimate
oversight
of
the
irs's
review
of
a
sitting
president's
returns
and
that
a
whistleblower
has
given
them
evidence
of
possible
interference
with
trump's
audit
related
coverage
here
are
all
the
ways
democrats
are
trying
to
get
trump's
tax
returns
democrats
insist
they
haven't
been
wasting
time
on
trump's
tax
returns
democrats
just
got
a
break
in
their
trump
tax
return
case
