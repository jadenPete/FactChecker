the

democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
dismissed
criticism
of
his
frequent
gaffes
and
misstatements
including
his
recent
exaggerations
of
a
war
story
claiming
they
are
irrelevant
to
his
ability
to
serve
as
president
the
details
are
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
the
former
vice
president
told
the
npr
politics
podcast
and
iowa
public
radio
in
an
interview
that
aired
tuesday
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
judgment
of
whether
or
not
you
send
troops
to
war
the
judgment
of
whether
you
bring
someone
home
the
judgment
of
whether
you
decide
on
a
health
care
policy
last
week
the
washington
post
reported
that
biden
exaggerated
mixed
up
and
conflated
key
elements
of
a
war
story
that
he
has
told
on
the
campaign
trail
almost
every
detail
in
the
story
appears
to
be
incorrect
the
post
wrote
based
on
interviews
with
more
than
a
dozen
u.s.
troops
their
commanders
and
biden
campaign
officials
it
appears
as
though
the
former
vice
president
has
jumbled
elements
of
at
least
three
actual
events
into
one
story
of
bravery
compassion
and
regret
that
never
happened
biden's
long
history
of
gaffes
and
misstatements
including
a
plagiarism
scandal
that
torpedoed
his
presidential
run
has
continued
on
the
campaign
trail
in
recent
weeks
he
accidentally
referred
to
vermont
while
speaking
in
new
hampshire
said
that
poor
kids
are
just
as
bright
as
white
kids
and
falsely
stated
that
he
was
vice
president
at
the
time
of
the
parkland
florida
school
shooting
last
year
president
donald
trump
who
frequently
lies
and
the
republican
national
committee
have
seized
on
the
gaffes
by
suggesting
biden
a
democratic
front-runner
is
mentally
unfit
to
serve
as
president
biden
responded
last
week
by
joking
i'm
not
going
nuts
others
have
defended
biden
noting
that
the
gaffes
shouldn't
be
equated
with
trump's
profusion
of
falsehoods
biden
has
also
faced
criticism
for
tone-deaf
comments
on
the
campaign
trail
such
as
making
jokes
about
allegations
that
he
inappropriately
touched
women
