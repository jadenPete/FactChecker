soon
after
asked
customers
not
to
do
so
even
in
so-called
open
carry
states
that
allow
the
practice
walmart's
request
came
with
an
announcement
that
the
nation's
largest
retailer
would
stop
selling
handgun
ammunition
and
short-barrel
rifle
ammunition
walmart's
decision
came
on
the

a
mass

inside
an
el
paso
texas
store
in
early
august
that
left
people
dead
that

walgreens
cvs

walmart
said
the
policy
would
not
be
enforced
but
that
management
is
instructed
to
contact
law
enforcement
if
they
feel
threatened
it's
a
respectful
request
walmart
spokesperson
ragan
dickens
told
huffpost
and
if
they
do
not
listen
to
the
request
we've
asked
management
to
evaluate
each
situation
if
an
individual
is
a
potential
threat
the
manager
on
duty
can
contact
law
enforcement
it's
not
clear
how
other
stores
will
enforce
the
new
policies
but
kris
brown
of
advocacy
group
brady
united
told
cnn
that
the
move
by
walmart
is
telling
the
nra
that
logic
does
not
support
what
they've
been
saying
this
good
guy
with
a
gun
idea
is
patently
false
huffpost
has
reached
out
to
all
of
the
retailers
for
comment
on
how
they
plan
to
enforce
the
policies
