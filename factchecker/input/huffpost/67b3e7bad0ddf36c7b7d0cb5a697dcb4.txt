the
pentagon
will
cut
funding
from
military
projects
like
schools
target
ranges
and
maintenance
facilities
to
pay
for
the
construction
of
miles
of
fencing
along
the
u.s.

border
diverting
a
total
billion
to
president
donald
trump's
long-promised
barrier
projects
in
states
countries
and
three
u.s.
territories
would
be
stalled
or
killed
by
the
plan
though
just
billion
in
cuts
would
strike
the
continental
u.s.
according
to
a
list
released
wednesday
by
the
pentagon
almost
million
would
come
from
projects
in
u.s.
territories
with
another
billion
coming
from
projects
on
overseas
bases
trump's
move
would
take
the
biggest
step
yet
in
delivering
on
his
promise
to
build
a
wall
to
block
immigrants
from
entering
the
country
illegally
but
it
may
come
at
the
expense
of
projects
that
the
pentagon
acknowledged
may
be
difficult
to
fund
anew
capitol

democrats
outraged
over
trump's
use
of
an
emergency
order
for
the
wall
promised
they
won't
approve
money
to
revive
them
a
senior
defense
official
told
reporters
the
pentagon
is
having
conversations
with
members
of
congress
to
urge
them
to
restore
the
funding
the
official
agreed
that
the
department
has
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
us
considering
that
congress
has
given
no
guarantee
it
will
provide
money
for
the
defunded
projects
the
official
was
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
details
publicly
so
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
in

new
stretches
of
fencing
proposed
along
the
rio
grande
and
through
a

refuge
in

promise
to
ignite
legal
battles
that
could
delay
the
wall
projects
as
well
the
military
base
projects
facing
the
chopping
block
tend
to
address
less
urgent
needs
like
new
parking
at
the
u.s.
military
academy
at
west
point
new
york
and
a
variety
of
small
arms
ranges
at
bases
in
wisconsin
and
oklahoma
but
a
cyber
ops
facility
in
hampton
virginia
and
the
expansion
of
a
missile
defense
field
at
fort
greeley
alaska
face
the
ax
too
trump
has
so
far
succeeded
in
building
replacement
barriers
within
the
miles
of
fencing
built
during
the
obama
and
bush
administrations
the
funding
shift
will
allow
for
about
miles
of
new
pedestrian
fencing
in
areas
where
there
isn't
any
now
the
wall
is
being
built
it's
going
up
rapidly
trump
said
wednesday
and
we
think
by
the
end
of
next
year
which
will
be
sometime
right
after
the
election
actually
but
we
think
we're
going
to
have
close
to
miles
of
wall
which
will
be
complete
new
stretches
of
fencing
are
sure
to
spark
legal
battles
with
angry
landowners
and
environmentalists
the
pentagon
plan
also
fuels
the
persistent
controversy
between
the
trump
administration
and
congress
over
immigration
policies
and
the
funding
of
the
border
wall
it
doesn't
take
any
input
from
the
local
communities
it
will
take
away
from
the
private
property
rights
said
rep
henry
cuellar
d-texas
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
stop
the
president
cuellar
suggested
democrats
will
look
at
a
must-pass
funding
bill
this
month
required
to
prevent
a
government
shutdown
oct
to
try
to
take
on
trump
but
a
more
likely
venue
for
the
battle
could
be
ongoing
house-senate
negotiations
over
the
annual
pentagon
policy
measure
lawmakers
who
refused
earlier
this
year
to
approve
nearly
billion
for
the
wall
must
now
decide
if
they
will
restore
the
projects
that
are
being
used
to
provide
the
money
to
pay
for
his
xenophobic
border

boondoggle
president

about
to

canceled

the
pentagon
is
saying
the
military
projects
are
being
deferred
congress
approved
billion
for
wall
construction
in
this
year's
budget
same
as
the
previous
year
and
far
less
than
the
billion
that
the
white
house
sought
trump
grudgingly
accepted
the
money
to
end
a
day
government
shutdown
in
february
but
simultaneously
declared
a
national
emergency
to
take
money
from
other
government
accounts
identifying
up
to
billion
for

construction
the
transferred
funds
include
million
from

now
the

tuesday
the
pentagon
reviewed
the
list
of
military
projects
and
said
none
that
provided
housing
or
critical
infrastructure
for
troops
would
be
affected
in
the
wake
of
recent
scandals
over
poor
living
quarters
for
service
members
in
several
parts
of
the
country
defense
officials
also
said
they
would
focus
on
projects
set
to
begin
in
and
beyond
with
the
hope
that
the
money
could
eventually
be
restored
by

the

will
spend
the
