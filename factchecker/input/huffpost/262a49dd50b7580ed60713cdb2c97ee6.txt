document
reveals
the
fbi
is
tracking
border
protest
groups
as
extremist
organizations
the
groups
targeted
in
the
bureau's
investigation
are
largely
involved
in
nonviolent
civil
disobedience
washington
the
fbi
is
monitoring
groups
on
the
border
that
are
protesting
u.s.
immigration
policy
according
to
a
document
obtained
by
yahoo
news
the
fbi
has
gathered
intelligence
from
people
with
direct
access
to
the
organizations
and
is
monitoring
their
social
media
according
to
the
document
called
an
external
intelligence
note
that
was
obtained
by
yahoo
news
the
note
which
was
produced
by
the
fbi
office
in
phoenix
and
sent
to
other
law
enforcement
and
government
agencies
said
there
are
indications
these
groups
are
increasingly
arming
themselves
and
using
lethal
force
to
further
their
goals
however
almost
all
of
the
evidence
cited
in
the
report
involved
nonviolent
protest
activity
the
intelligence
collected
and
cited
in
the
fbi
document
dated
may
is
worrisome
to
activists
and
civil
rights
advocates
who
say
that
the
government
is
classifying
legitimate
government
opposition
and
legally
protected
speech
as
violent
extremism
or
domestic
terrorism
the
document
raises
potential
legal
concerns
in
a
gray
area
not
yet
tested
by
the
courts
geoffrey
stone
a
university
of
chicago
law
professor
told
yahoo
news
if
you're
investigating
antiwar
and
anti-trump
groups
you
run
the
risk
of
interfering
with
free
speech
rights
said
stone
who
was
tapped
by
president
obama
to
help
review
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
programs
following
the
edward
snowden
disclosures
in
a
statement
to
yahoo
news
an
fbi
spokesperson
described
the
external
intelligence
note
about
border
protests
groups
as
part
of
routine
information-sharing
among
law
enforcement
agencies
and
emphasized
that
it
contained
the
perspective
of
the
phoenix
office
these
products
are
intended
to
be
informative
in
nature
the
fbi
spokesperson
said
and
as
such
they
contain
appropriate
caveats
to
describe
the
confidence
in
the
sourcing
of
information
and
the
likelihood
of
the
assessment
additionally
when
written
at
a
local
level
these
products
will
note
that
the
perspective
offered
may
be
limited
to
the
field
office's
area
of
responsibility
while
the
external
intelligence
note
on
border
protest
groups
was
originally
generated
by
the
fbi's
phoenix
office
it
was
distributed
widely
throughout
the
bureau
and
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
country
by
colin
campbell
on
scribd
mike
german
a
former
fbi
special
agent
and
fellow
at
new
york
university
who
has
written
extensively
about
surveillance
of
activists
sees
the
document
as
evidence
of
the
bureau's
overreach
when
it
comes
to
classifying
domestic
groups
as
terrorist
threats
it's
been
a
feature
of
the
post
counterterrorism
effort
by
the
fbi
to
focus
on
nonviolent
civil
disobedience
and
to
prioritize
it
said
german
for
several
years
after
the
fbi
called
environmental
activists
the
no
domestic
terror
threat
even
though
there's
not
a
single
homicide
related
to
environmental
terrorists
in
the
united
states
the
justice
department
which
first
created
guidelines
for
domestic
investigations
during
the
mid-
s
amid
fallout
from
law
enforcement's
response
to
the
antiwar
movement
has
modified
those
policies
over
the
years
in
response
to
a
series
of
questions
about
the
authority
under
which
they
can
investigate
border
protest
groups
the
fbi
referred
yahoo
news
to
the
most
recent
publicly
available
guidelines
posted
on
the
fbi's
website
those
guidelines
which
predate
the
trump
administration
specify
that
any
investigations
must
be
conducted
within
constitutional
and
statutory
parameters
and
that
civil
liberties
and
privacy
are
protected
despite
the
procedures
that
are
in
place
there
have
been
issues
with
the
fbi's
investigation
of
domestic
protest
groups
in
the
past
german
the
former
special
agent
and
legal
expert
cited
a
report
from
the
fbi's
inspector
general
that
was
released
in
and
criticized
the
bureau
for
classifying
nonviolent
crimes
related
to
protest
as
terrorism
that
report
found
that
the
factual
basis
for
opening
some
of
the
investigations
into
advocacy
groups
including
peta
and
greenpeace
was
factually
weak
with
little
indication
of
any
possible
federal
crimes
the
fbi
had
also
designated
some
investigations
relating
to
nonviolent
civil
disobedience
under
its
acts
of
terrorism
classification
what
constitutes
an
extremist
threat
is
the
subject
of
ongoing
debate
some
left-wing
organizations
have
in
fact
been
associated
with
violent
attacks
against
opponents
critics
have
pointed
out
however
that
such
groups
present
less
of
a
threat
than
some
of
those
on
the
right
including
white
supremacists
who
were
involved
in
the
majority
of
domestic
terror
incidents
last
year
yahoo
news
spoke
to
three
of
the
activists
specifically
cited
in
the
fbi's
note
they
said
they
were
not
surprised
to
learn
that
the
fbi
is
monitoring
them
because
of
prior
indications
that
law
enforcement
has
been
investigating
recent
protest
activity
as
well
as
the
u.s.
government's
history
of
policing
liberal
activism
corey
lemley
a
self-described
antifascist
activist
in
tennessee
whosetwitter
activity
was
included
in
the
fbi
report
said
he
knew
he
was
on
the
government's
radar
because
he
was
previously
visited
by
federal
authorities
at
his
home
after
he
helped
organize
counter
protests
against
neo-nazi
rallies
in
tennessee
last
year
he
also
pointed
to
the
government's
record
of
surveilling
activists
understanding
the
history
of
this
country
you'd
have
to
be
naive
to
be
surprised
lemley
said
this
is
nothing
new
the
fbi
intelligence
note
described
the
border
protest
activity
as
coming
from
anarchist
extremists
though
it
specifies
that
the
analysis
is
written
by
the
fbi's
phoenix
office
and
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
bureau's
national
perspective
the
note
shows
that
at
least
in
arizona
the
bureau
is
tracking
border
protest
groups
and
labeling
them
a
source
of
potential
violence
the
note
also
provides
indications
of
how
other
u.s.
law
enforcement
agencies
especially
the
department
of
homeland
security
are
tracking
border
protests
around
the
country
fbi
phoenix
assesses
anarchist
extremists
aes
very
likely
are
increasing
the
targeting
of
u.s.
government
law
enforcement
personnel
and
facilities
along
the
arizona
border
increasing
the
risk
of
armed
conflict
the
note
said
fbi
phoenix
also
assesses
arizona-based
aes
likely
are
increasingly
arming
themselves
and
using
lethal
force
to
further
their
goals
and
in
confrontations
with
ideologically
opposed
groups
the
note
tied
the
potential
for
increased
protest
activity
and
by
extension
violence
to
opposition
to
president
trump's
immigration
policies
with
immigration
issues
unlikely
to
be
resolved
soon
it
said
the
anarchist
extremist
threat
to
arizona
likely
will
grow
in
intensity
and
frequency
the
note
goes
on
to
show
some
of
the
evidence
behind
these
conclusions
citing
two
separate
reports
from
the
department
of
homeland
security
that
identified
posts
written
by
activists
online
including
one
that
called
for
actions
to
disturb
the
daily
operations
of
the
border
by
fighting
ice
and
the
border
industrial
complex
it
also
cited
a
tweet
written
in
may
by
corey
lemley
the
activist
intennessee
every
ice
detention
center
shall
be
taken
over
with
ice
employees
detained
until
every
immigrant
is
freed
lemley
wrote
lemley
who
is
a
year-old
videographer
told
yahoo
news
his
tweet
was
not
meant
to
be
a
threat
and
he
does
not
advocate
proactive
violence
the
resistance
is
going
to
take
many
shapes
and
many
different
forms
said
lemley
right
now
we
do
not
have
any
plans
to
have
an
armed
rebellion
or
armed
resistance
against
the
state
there
are
photos
of
lemley
holding
guns
on
his
personal
facebook
page
however
he
said
all
the
pictures
showed
him
in
legal
possession
and
did
not
indicate
any
threat
nothing
that
you
don't
see
a
redneck
post
on
a
daily
basis
lemley
said
the
fbi
phoenix
note
also
pointed
to
an
online
magazine
with
a
timeline
of
border
protest
activity
that
was
published
on
what
it
called
an
anarchist
extremist
website
in
february
the
fbi
phoenix
office
citing
less
than
words
from
the
magazine
says
this
timeline
was
designed
to
aid
a
trajectory
of
rebellion
against
u.s.
border
policy
and
that
it
encouraged
readers
to
identify
relevant
targets
in
your
town
based
on
the
date
and
quotes
cited
by
the
note
the
fbi
seems
to
be
referring
to
a
post
on
the
activist
website
it's
going
down
which
linked
to
the
online
magazine
despite
the
use
of
language
like
attacks
and
targets
almost
all
of
the
actions
described
in
the
magazine
are
nonviolent
civil
disobedience
the
phoenix
fbi's
intelligence
note
cites
less
than
words
from
a
document
that
is
pages
long
and
covers
events
the
vast
majority
of
them
involve
nonviolent
protest
tactics
like
hanging
banners
and
posters
blocking
streets
and
border
patrol
cars
and
marches
including
one
that
was
hosted
by
a
local
presbyterian
church
eight
of
the
incidents
described
in
the
timeline
involved
more
dangerous
behavior
including
vandalism
and
skirmishes
at
protests
yahoo
news
emailed
it's
going
down
and
received
a
response
from
someone
who
would
not
give
their
name
but
wrote
the
post
cited
by
the
fbi
made
no
direct
calls
to
physical
violence
the
person
argued
that
the
fbi
is
attempting
to
build
a
false
narrative
around
the
threat
of
violence
against
the
public
coming
from
the
abolishicemovement
they
further
suggested
the
government
is
exaggerating
the
threat
from
the
left-wing
protest
movement
while
minimizing
the
dangers
associated
with
far-right
and
white
supremacist
groups
the
fbi
document
also
said
the
bureau
was
tracking
an
arizona-based
left-wing
militia-like
group
identified
as
the
border
liberation
front
according
to
the
note
the
fbi
was
told
about
the
group's
activities
from
a
human
source
with
direct
access
however
while
the
note
implied
the
group
was
armed
it
also
indicated
the
border
liberation
front's
activities
were
largely
nonviolent
and
described
the
group
as
dedicated
to
monitoring
various
u.s.
border
patrol
activities
right-wing
militia
groups
and
other
groups
favoring
the
border
wall
mostly
to
expose
human
rights
abuses
in
the
document
the
border
liberation
front
is
linked
to
alleged
planning
efforts
to
disrupt
u.s.
border
security
operations
and
the
building
of
a
wall
along
the
u.s.
border
with
mexico
the
group's
activities
in
fact
were
identified
as
being
most
critical
to
the
fbi's
conclusion
that
extremist
border
protest
groups
were
increasingly
arming
themselves
and
using
lethal
force
a
woman
who
answered
a
phone
number
associated
with
the
border
liberationfront
but
would
not
identify
herself
by
name
said
the
group
recently
split
into
two
and
the
other
organization
is
called
caravan
support
network
while
caravan
support
network
was
not
named
in
the
fbi
phoenix
note
the
woman
said
she
believes
the
fbi
is
monitoring
it
rather
than
the
border
liberation
front
there
are
multiple
links
between
the
social
media
pages
of
the
border
liberation
front
and
the
caravan
support
network
none
of
the
pages
for
either
group
viewed
by
yahoo
news
contain
indications
of
violent
activity
the
woman
associated
with
the
border
liberation
front
said
she
was
not
surprised
to
hear
about
fbi
monitoring
because
people
associated
with
the
caravan
support
network
were
on
a
list
of
activists
and
journalists
who
were
in
a
government
database
revealed
by
nbc
in
march
the
fbi
document
claims
the
border
liberation
front
organizers
planned
for
camps
in
texas
and
arizona
to
serve
as
staging
platforms
for
on-site
armed
support
of
the
migrant
caravans
and
intended
to
purchase
firearms
from
a
mexico-based
cartel
associate
but
the
woman
who
spoke
to
yahoo
news
said
all
of
border
liberation
front's
activities
are
humanitarian
all
we
do
is
just
raise
funds
and
then
make
sure
those
that
are
seeking
asylum
have
the
things
that
they
need
clothes
and
food
the
woman
said
the
fbi
note
also
said
a
human
source
with
direct
access
described
an
antifa
training
seminar
that
took
place
in
flagstaff
last
april
and
allegedly
involved
firearms
the
trainers
had
on
display
various
firearms
among
them
ar-
s
ak-
s
and
handguns
the
note
said
an
event
matching
the
description
in
the
fbi
note
was
hosted
by
taala
hoogan
an
arizona
group
that
describes
itself
as
an
anti-colonial
anti-capitalist
community
space
advertisements
for
the
event
show
that
it
included
a
workshop
on
armed
defense
taala
hoogan
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
fbi
document
also
cited
information
received
via
a
public
tip
line
about
the
group
redneck
revolt
a
national
left-wing
organization
that
describes
itself
as
dedicated
to
community
defense
the
fbi
said
the
tipster
noted
that
the
group
has
raised
money
for
firearms
purchases
and
has
offered
to
act
as
armed
security
for
various
protests
the
group
often
maintains
a
visible
armed
presence
at
protests
redneckrevolt's
phoenix
chapter
which
is
also
called
the
john
brown
gun
club
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
this
story
but
a
member
of
the
group
had
spoken
to
yahoo
news
at
a
protest
outside
a
trump
rally
in
we're
a
community
defense
organization
so
we're
here
to
provide
security
and
make
sure
nobody
is
attacked
by
white
nationalists
or
fascists
said
the
man
who
was
carrying
a
rifle
the
phoenix
fbi's
note
addressed
the
possibility
that
left-wing
border
protest
groups
would
mainly
use
weapons
for
defensive
purposes
however
this
alternative
hypothesis
was
rejected
in
the
note
based
on
direct
human
source
reporting
detailing
various
anarchist
extremist
groups
plans
for
direct
action
and
offensive
postures
german
the
former
fbi
special
agent
said
that
even
if
some
activists
are
armed
that's
not
evidence
they
are
a
terror
threat
congress
passed
a
definition
of
domestic
terrorism
it
requires
illegal
activities
harmful
to
human
life
german
said
i'm
not
aware
of
any
fatal
attacks
committed
by
somebody
associated
with
an
antifascist
movement
nate
snyder
who
served
in
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
as
an
adviser
to
the
justice
department
during
the
obama
administration
described
the
document
as
kind
of
a
head
scratcher
snyder
who
reviewed
a
copy
provided
to
him
by
yahoo
news
said
the
sourcing
and
evidence
in
the
intelligence
note
was
unusually
thin
why
would
they
put
out
something
out
there
to
the
field
with
that
lack
of
confidence
and
numerous
unvalidated
sources
he
asked
snyder
also
questioned
why
the
fbi
would
be
including
antifascist
groups
anarchist
extremists
and
militia
organizations
together
from
an
analyst's
perspective
those
are
three
very
different
groups
he
said
for
his
part
german
argued
that
the
bureau
should
be
focusing
on
clear
threats
rather
than
speculating
about
potential
dangers
from
left-wing
protest
groups
there
are
people
out
there
actually
harming
other
people
and
that's
where
the
counterterrorism
resources
should
be
devoted
german
said
not
toward
people
who
are
simply
challenging
government
policy
