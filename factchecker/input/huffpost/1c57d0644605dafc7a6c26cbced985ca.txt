the
republican
senator
hasn't
held
a
public
town
hall
event
in
colorado
for
almost
two
years
so
activists
sent
his
two-dimensional
replica
around
the
state
instead
denver
he's
a
great
listener
he's
extremely
patient
and
though
his
personality
can
be
a
bit
flat
he
never
ducks
a
question
because
he
can't
move
he
is

frustrated
activists
created

ceased
holding

in

of
unannounced
private

in

absence
cardboard

has
been
hosting

with
real

activists
have
been
lugging
six
cardboard
cories
to
various
meet-and-greets
forums
and
other
events
where
constituents
are
encouraged
to
ask
questions
of
the

that
they
can't
direct
at
the

some

the
tour
kicked
off
last
monday
with
a
stop
outside
gardner's
denver
office
where
state
rep
tom
sullivan
whose
son
was
murdered
in
the
aurora
theater
shooting
said
he's
been
trying
to
meet
with
gardner
for
the
better
part
of
a
decade
cory
gardner
has
refused
to
meet
with
me
for
seven-plus
years
and
i've
made
it
very
easy
for
him
said
sullivan
our
family
endured
the
worst
mass
shooting
in
our
state's
history
and
he
doesn't
have
the
courage
to
stand
in
front
of
me
and
my
family
and
at
least
give
us
the
i'm
sorry
for
your
loss
talk
i
can't
imagine
the
lack
of
compassion
he
shows
for
people
like
dreamers
sullivan
added
referring
to
undocumented
young
people
brought
to
the
u.s.
as
children
at
a
stop
in
grand
junction
on
thursday
cancer
survivor
and
health
care
activist
laura
packard
who
was
part
of
the
bus
tour
encouraged
the
senator
to
host
more
public
events
i
think
that
it's
pretty
sad
that
you
have
to
talk
to
a
paper
product
instead
of
your
elected
u.s.
senator
packard
told
the
media
i
don't
understand
why
he's
so
afraid
of
coloradans
he
should
do
more
public
town
halls
so
that
he
can
hear
from
us
and
hear
what
we
have
to
say
cardboardcoryco
enjoying
our
beautiful
colorado
open
spaces
before
sencorygardner

activists
say
it's
been
days
since
gardner's
most
recent
public
town
hall
in
his
office
was
unable
to
prove
otherwise
to
the
greeley
tribune
gardner's
last
two
town
hall
events
were
days
apart
according
to
a
local
activist
all
the
while
the
senator
has
repeatedly
pointedly
ignored
interview
requests
from
local
media
and
dismissed
an
uptick
in
phone
calls
to
his
office
in
as
coming
from
paid
protesters
gardner's
office
didn't
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
from
huffpost
related
coverage
about
five
minutes
allocated
for
questions
at
gardner's
first
town
hall
in
days
gardner
loves
conservative
radio
shows
but
not
