made
the

was
necessary
i
find

trump
and
a
number
of
administration
officials
have
repeatedly
stayed
at
trump-owned
properties
during
his
presidency
raising
concerns
about
whether
the
president
has
profited
from
his
presidency
legal
observers
have
also
questioned
whether
he
has
violated
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
which
prohibits
federal
officials
from
profiting
from
foreign
or
domestic
government
bodies
on
a
diplomatic
trip
this
week
pence
stayed
at
the
trump
international
golf
links
hotel
in
doonbeg
ireland
more
than
miles
from
the
country's
capital
dublin
where
his
official
events
and
meetings
were
in
response
to
inquiries
earlier
this
week
pence's
office
initially
claimed
that
he
stayed
at
trump's
golf
club
at
the
suggestion
of
the
president
pence
also
described
it
as
a
family
visit
because
his
cousin
runs
a
bar
in
doonbeg
and
his
great-grandmother
grew
up
there
i
am
alarmed
that
you
elected
to
spend
taxpayer
dollars
for
travel
and
lodging
at
president
trump's
privately-owned
property
located
on
the
other
side
of
the
country
more
than
miles
away
from
your
meetings
with

officials
in
dublin

wrote
thursday
this
raises
serious
concerns
about
wasteful
expenditures
and
possible
conflicts

interest
related
to
taxpayer-funded
travel
by
this
administration
peters
also
attached
a
series
of
questions
to
pence
about
the
trip
including
how
much
it
cost
taxpayers
and
the
government
whether
he
was
charged
the
regular
rate
or
a
government
rate
and
whether
any
analysis
was
conducted
to
compare
the
full
costs
of
travel
including
lodging
security
and
other
travel
costs
for
staying
in
doonbeg
instead
of
dublin
