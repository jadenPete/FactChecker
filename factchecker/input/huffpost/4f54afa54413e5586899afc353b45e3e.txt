north
carolina
court
says
the
state's
districts
are
illegal
partisan
gerrymanders
activists
believe
state
courts
may
offer
a
way
to
rein
in
excessive
gerrymandering
north
carolina's
state
legislative
maps
are
so
severely
gerrymandered
to
benefit
republicans
that
they
violate
the
state's
constitution
a
panel
of
three
judges
ruled
tuesday
the
ruling
came
in
a
closely
watched
case
in
north
carolina
state
court
state
lawmakers
have
until
sept
to
draw
new
districts
the
court
said
and
they
won't
be
allowed
to
take
into
account
any
data
about
election
results
lawmakers
will
also
be
banned
from
using
the
existing
maps
as
a
starting
point
as
they
draw
new
maps
and
will
be
required
to
draw
maps
entirely
in
public
view
the
court
ruled
any
computer
screen
the
lawmakers
use
the
court
said
has
to
be
fully
visible
to
lawmakers
and
public
observers
extreme
partisan
gerrymandering
does
not
fairly
and
truthfully
ascertain
the
will
of
the
people
the
judges
wrote
voters
are
not
freely
choosing
their
representatives
rather
representatives
are
choosing
their
voters
it
is
not
the
will
of
the
people
that
is
fairly
ascertained
through
extreme
partisan
gerrymandering
rather
it
is
the
will
of
the
map
drawers
that
prevails
the
case
was
decided
by
three
superior
court
judges
paul
ridgeway
joseph
crosswhite
and
alma
hinton
the
judges
noted
in
the
opinion
that
they
are
each
from
different
parts
of
the
state
and
have
differing
ideological
and
political
outlooks
the
case
carries
implications
that
go
beyond
north
carolina
in
june
the
u.s.
supreme
court
ruled
that
federal
courts
can't
do
anything
to
stop
partisan
gerrymandering
but
activists
believe
litigation
in
state
courts
could
offer
a
way
to
challenge
partisan
gerrymandering
an
idea
that
tuesday's
ruling
seems
to
bear
out
north
carolina
republicans
controlled
the
redistricting
process
in
the
state
in
and
drew
congressional
and
state
legislative
district
lines
that
significantly
benefited
gop
lawmakers
republicans
were
consistently
able
to
win
more
than
of
the
seats
in
both
of
the
state's
legislative
chambers
despite
winning
only
about
half
of
the
statewide
vote
they
enjoyed
that
veto-proof
majority
until
when
democrats
broke
it
the
case
common
cause
v
lewis
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
advocacy
group
common
cause
the
north
carolina
democratic
party
and
a
handful
of
democratic
voters
throughout
the
state
in
its
page
opinion
the
three-judge
panel
said
the
districts
were
so
gerrymandered
that
they
violated
three
provisions
in
the
north
carolina
constitution
one
of
those
measures
simply
says
that
all
elections
shall
be
free
partisan
gerrymandering
the
panel
wrote
works
by
diluting
the
votes
of
some
citizens
compared
with
others
redistricting
plans
that
entrench
politicians
in
power
that
evincea
fundamental
distrust
of
voters
by
serving
the
self-interest
of
political
parties
over
the
public
good
and
that
dilute
and
devalue
votes
of
some
citizens
compared
to
others
is
contrary
to
the
fundamental
right
of
north
carolina
citizens
to
have
elections
conducted
freely
and
honestly
to
ascertain
fairly
and
truthfully
the
will
of
the
people
they
wrote
the
excessive
gerrymandering
also
violates
the
north
carolina
constitution's
guarantees
of
equal
protection
under
the
law
and
free
speech
and
assembly
the
court
also
found
that
the
maps
were
designed
to
intentionally
discriminate
against
democrats
and
there
was
no
other
legitimate
explanation
for
the
boundaries
other
than
partisan
advantage
senate
majority
leader
phil
berger
r
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
that
lawmakers
would
not
appeal
the
ruling
and
would
move
forward
with
adoption
of
a
nonpartisan
map
we
disagree
with
the
court's
ruling
as
it
contradicts
the
constitution
and
binding
legal
precedent
but
we
intend
to
respect
the
court's
decision
and
finally
put
this
divisive
battle
behind
us
he
said
in
a
statement
nearly
a
decade
of
relentless
litigation
has
strained
the
legitimacy
of
the
state's
institutions
and
the
relationship
between
its
leaders
to
the
breaking
point
it's
time
to
move
on
a
spokesman
for
house
speaker
tim
moore
r
said
he
was
still
reviewing
the
ruling
if
lawmakers
appeal
the
case
will
likely
be
ultimately
decided
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
democrats
hold
a
majority
on
that
panel
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
were
aided
by
an
explosive
discovery
from
the
files
of
thomas
hofeller
a
noted
republican
redistricting
expert
who
died
last
summer
hofeller's
daughter
turned
over
her
late
father's
computer
drives
to
common
cause
and
they
contained
formulas
and
other
clear
evidence
of
how
hofeller
sought
to
maximize
partisan
gain
as
he
drew
districts
the
three-judge
panel
pointed
repeatedly
to
hofeller's
files
in
its
tuesday
ruling
to
show
that
republicans
were
motivated
by
maximizing
partisan
advantage
as
they
drew
districts
the
evidence
establishes
that
dr
hofeller
drew
the
plans
very
precisely
to
create
as
many
safe
republican
districts
as
possible
so
that
republicans
would
maintain
their
supermajorities
or
at
least
majorities
even
in
a
strong
election
year
for
democrats
the
panel
wrote
the
north
carolina
judges
also
suggested
that
lawmakers
had
misrepresented
the
timeline
under
which
they
redrew
the
state's
electoral
maps
in
though
lawyers
told
a
federal
court
they
weren't
drafting
maps
as
late
as
aug
hofeller
had
already
substantially
completed
his
work
by
late
june
the
panel
said
the
ruling
comes
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
ruled
the
state's
congressional
districts
violated
the
pennsylvania
constitution
in
june
the
united
states
supreme
court
ruled
that
federal
courts
were
powerless
to
limit
excessive
partisan
gerrymandering
but
chief
justice
john
roberts
writing
for
the
majority
noted
there
was
nothing
to
stop
state
courts
from
acting
provisions
in
state
statutes
and
state
constitutions
can
provide
standards
and
guidance
for
state
courts
to
apply
roberts
wrote
writing
in
dissent
justice
elena
kagan
however
said
that
the
fact
that
state
courts
could
act
was
evidence
that
federal
courts
could
act
too
what
do
those
courts
know
that
this
court
does
not
she
wrote
if
they
can
develop
and
apply
neutral
and
manageable
standards
to

gerrymanders
why
couldn't
