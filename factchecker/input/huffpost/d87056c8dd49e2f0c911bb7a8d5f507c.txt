protect

most
vulnerable
among
us
both
here
in
the
united

around

from
a
major
party
as
the
hrc
foundation
noted
in
its
announcement
president
donald
trump
and
his
administration
have
pushed
measures
that
negatively
affect
the
lgbtq
community
including
banning
openly
transgender
people
from
serving
in
the
military
and
seeking
to
roll
back
anti-discrimination
protections
although
the
federal
government
should
be
protecting
all
residents
the
trump-pence
administration
is
directly
attacking
our
community
by
banning
transgender
troops
from
serving
our
country
openly
undermining
health
care
services
for
people
living
with
hiv
and
seeking
to
erase
lgbtq
people
from
protections
under
law
david
said
the
lgbtq
town
hall
is
slated
to
take
place
five
days
ahead
of
the
fourth
democratic
primary
debate
