party
that
a
washington
post
report
says
will
likely
bring
the
hotel
more
than
in
revenue
the
post
said
tuesday
that
it
obtained
a
copy
of
the
contract
barr
signed
for
a
private
person
family
holiday
party
at
the
trump
international
hotel's
presidential
ballroom
on
dec
the
justice
department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
department
official
told
the
post
that
barr
is
paying
for
the
party
himself
and
only
chose
the
trump
hotel
after
finding
out
other
venues
were
booked
according
to

its

of
barr's
contract
requires
a

of
per
person
for
food
and
drink
before
an
additional
for

the
party
booking
is
the
latest
report
about
money
being
funneled
into
trump's
properties
during
his
presidency
a
day
earlier
trump
said
he
would
likely
hold
next
year's
international
group
of
seven
summit
at
his
golf
resort
in
doral
florida
he's
the
owner
of
the
thing
it
at
least
creates
the
appearance
of
corruption
former

ethics
director
walter
shaub
previously
told
huffpost
in
announcing
the
possibility
of
his
doral
resort
as
the
next
g-
site
trump
said
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
money
but
as
previously
reported
by
huffpost
trump
directly
receives
any
money
spent
on
his
properties
including
hotels
and
golf
courses
because
he
is
the
sole
beneficiary
of
a
trust
that
owns
his
family
business
the
trump
organization
the
president's
many
properties
frequently
host
lobbyists
trying
to
influence
his
policies
foreign
governments
and
politicians
opening
trump
to
conflicts
of
interest
the
justice
department
is
currently
defending
the
president's
washington
hotel
against
a
lawsuit
filed
by
nearly
members
of
congress
accusing
trump
of
violating
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
a
provision
to
prevent
corruption
by
continuing
to
profit
from
his
businesses
though
the
justice
department
told
the
post
that
barr
did
not
book
the
party
out
of
loyalty
to
the
president
the
top
u.s.
law
enforcement
official's
independence
from
trump
has
been
questioned
before
barr
was
criticized
earlier
this
year
for
making
misleading
remarks
about
then-special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
on
russian
interference
in
the
election
echoing
the
false
no
collusion
narrative
that
trump
has
been
repeating
for
years
shaub
who
has
been
a
vocal
critic
of
trump's
ethics
decisions
told
the
post
that
although
barr's
decision
to
book
a
party
at
trump's
hotel
does
not
violate
the
rules
the
attorney
general
keeps
sending
signals
that
his
loyalty
is
to
a
politician
and
not
to
the
country
