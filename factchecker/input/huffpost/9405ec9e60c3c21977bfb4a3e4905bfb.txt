rep
tim
ryan
joe
biden
is
declining
demonstrates
lack
of
clarity
we
can't
just
put
somebody
up
there
who
can't
beat
donald
trump
said
the
long-shot
democratic
presidential
hopeful
rep
tim
ryan
d-ohio
on
saturday
doubled
down
on
comments
he
made
last
week
claiming
fellow
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
is
declining
and
lacks
the
energy
needed
to
beat
president
donald
trump
in
ryan
told
cnn's
arlette
saenz
that
he
wasn't
backtracking
when
she
asked
him
clarify
remarks
he
made
to
a
bloomberg
reporter
on
thursday
it
is
a
concern
you're
hearing
from
a
lot
of
people
in
the
country
ryan
said
at
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
convention
referring
to
the
former
vice
president's
campaign
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
unclear
sometimes
when
biden
is
articulating
positions
there's
a
lack
of
clarity
and
i'll
leave
it
at
that
fredricka
whitfield
of
cnn
also
grilled
him
about
his
dig
at
biden
in
a
subsequent
interview
saturday
noting
that
trump
has
suggested
the
democratic
front-runner's
mental
agility
is
waning
are
your
comments
kind
of
in
step
with
what
the
president
is
saying
about
biden
whitfield
asked
well
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
president
trump
is
declining
ryan
responded
he's
very
forgetful
he's
not
as
sharp
he's
lost
a
lot
in
the
last
couple
years
ryan
added
that
he's
been
hearing
on
the
ground
that
people
are
at
times
concerned
by
biden's
lack
of
clarity
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
we
send
someone
to
take
down
donald
trump
who
can
articulate
a
very
clear
vision
for
the
country
in
a
very
forceful
and
firm
way
and
do
it
in
all
states
all
over
the
country
ryan
said
whitfield
pressed
ryan
to
be
more
specific
asking
whether
the
long-shot
democratic
presidential
contender
was
worried
about
biden's
age
at
biden
is
years
older
than
ryan
ryan
pointed
to
biden's
appearance
on
the
late
show
last
week
during
which
host
stephen
colbert
grilled
him
about
his
gaffes
on
the
campaign
trail
and
asked
him
point-blank
whether
he
was
going
nuts
biden
assured
him
he
is
not
it's
not
like
i
said
something
that
a
lot
of
people
aren't
thinking
or
he
wouldn't
have
went
on
colbert
to
talk
about
it
ryan
told
whitfield
so
this
is
an
issue
we
have
to
be
honest
with
each
other
there's
so
much
at
stake
in
this
election
we
can't
just
put
somebody
up
there
who
can't
beat
donald
trump
whether
it's
on
the
issues
or
on
the
issues
of
energy
or
lack
of
clarity
neither
ryan's
campaign
nor
trump's
reelection
campaign
responded
to
huffpost's
requests
for
comment
biden's
campaign
declined
to
comment
despite
being
a
self-described
gaffe
machine
biden
has
consistently
led
in
the
polls
by
a
significant
margin
since
announcing
his
candidacy
in
april
ryan
is
polling
at
less
than
and
did
not
qualify
for
the
third
primary
debate
scheduled
for
next
week
