at
that
time
the
drama
over
president
donald
trump's
incorrect
tweet
about
alabama
and
hurricane
dorian
continues
as
a
federal
agency
publicly
denounced
the
national
weather
service's
birmingham
station
for
contradicting
the
president
in
a
brief
statement
attributed
to
an
anonymous
official
the

oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
noaa
said
that
nws
birmingham
misspoke
when
it
tweeted
that
alabama
would
not
see
any
effects
from
dorian
nws
birmingham
spoke
in
absolute
terms
that
were
inconsistent
with
probabilities
from
the
best
forecast
products
available
at
the
time
the
statement
read
the
unnamed
noaa
official
also
claimed
that
the
information
it
provided
to
trump
last
weekend
showed
that
dorian
could
produce
tropical-storm-force
winds
in
the
state
to
prove
its
point
the
agency
included
a
link
to
a
probability
model
predicting
that
there
was
a
to
probability
that
tropical
force
storm
winds
would
affect
alabama
for
a
few
days
however
meteorologist
ryan
maue
pointed
out
that
another
model
from
sept
when
trump
first
sent
his
tweet
showed
that
alabama
was
definitely
outside
of
any
threat
cone
on
sunday
as
hurricane
dorian
made
its
way
toward
the
carolinas
trump
warned
several
states
including
alabama
about
one
of
the
largest
hurricanes
ever
tweeting
that
those
states
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
less
than
a
half-hour
later
nws
birmingham
corrected
trump
by
notifying
residents
that
they
would
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
the
system
will
remain
too
far
east
the
state
weather
agency
tweeted
though
the
clash
happened
last
weekend
trump
continued
to
defend
his
tweet
and
complain
about
the
flak
he's
received
over
media
reports
that
point
out
that
he
was
wrong
the
president
held
a
hurricane
briefing
on
wednesday
and
presented
a
map
with
old
data
showing
dorian's
trajectory
the
map
also
appeared
to
be
modified
with
a
black
marking
that
encompassed
part
of
alabama
trump
continued
to
air
his
grievances
on
twitter
slamming
the
fake
news
he
also
walked
his
original
tweet
back
by
saying
that
alabama
was
going
to
be
hit
or
grazed
before
dorian
took
a
different
path
and
in
another
attempt
to
prove
he
wasn't
wrong
the
president
tweeted
an
edited
video
of
a
cnn
segment
that
noted
alabama
might
feel
the
effects
of
the
hurricane
the
video
ended
with
a
clip
of
the
cnn
logo
juxtaposed
over
a
vehicle
involved
in
a
fiery
crash
