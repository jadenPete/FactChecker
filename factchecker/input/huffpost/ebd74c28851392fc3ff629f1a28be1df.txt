world's
saddest
rally
donald
trump
jr
mocked
for
speaking
to
mostly
empty
arena
just
a
couple
hundred
people
turned
out
for
the
event
meant
to
help
kentucky

bevin
r
don't
expect
to
hear
much
bragging
about
this
crowd
donald
trump
jr
son
of
president
donald
trump
spoke
on
thursday
at
a
rally
in
kentucky
for
gov
matt
bevin
r
who
is
running
for
reelection
in
a
tight
race
against
state
attorney
general
andy
beshear
d
local
cbs
station
wymt
reported
before
the
event
that
locals
expect
a
memorable
turnout
and
indeed
it
was
but
perhaps
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
for
trump
kentucky
public
radio's
ryland
barton
tweeted
an
image
of
the
scene
in
pikeville
organizers
have
asked
the
audience
to
move
out
of
the
seats
and
closer
to
the
stage
ahead
of
trump
jr
gov
bevin
event
in

think
it's

like
his
father
trump
jr
often
brags
about
the
crowd
at
events
especially
presidential
rallies
earlier
this
year
the
president's
son
mocked
democratic
presidential
hopeful
beto
o'rourke
for
drawing
a
few
hundred
people
to
a
rally
yet
according
to
louisville
radio
station
wfpl
only
about
people
turned
out
for
the
bevin
event
at
the
appalachian
wireless
arena
the
venue
has
a
capacity
of
or
roughly
the
actual
size
of
o'rourke's
crowd
in
texas
despite
trump
jr
s
claims
to
the
contrary
the
scene
in
kentucky
was
also
captured
on
video
almost
views
so
far
of
american
bridge's
video
from
the
crooked
mattbevin
donaldjtrumpjr
rally
that
no
one
went
to
in
a
county
trump
won
by
in
either
don
jr
isn't
a
draw
or
people
really
hate
