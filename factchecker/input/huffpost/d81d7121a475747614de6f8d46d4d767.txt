mass
shootings
are
just
getting
worse
as
fbi
fights
to
keep
up
an
fbi
agent
says
authorities
are
responding
to
an
active
shooter
every
other
week
in
this
country
as
incidents
trend
up
every
year
mass
shootings
have
been
on
the
rise
for
nearly
two
decades
and
they're
so
prevalent
that
investigators
are
struggling
to
keep
up
law
enforcement
agencies
are
grappling
with
the
sheer
number
of
active
shooter
investigations
on
their
plates
fbi
special
agent
in
charge
christopher
combs
said
after
a
shooter
killed
at
least
seven
people
and
wounded
more
than
others
in
west
texas
on
saturday
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
we're
looking
at
an
active
shooter
every
other
week
in
this
country
combs
said
according
to
cnn
an
fbi
study
on
active
shooters
reveals
a
similarly
bleak
trend
incidents
involving
an
active
shooter
which
the
fbi
defines
as
an
individual
actively
engaged
in
killing
or
attempting
to
kill
people
in
a
populated
area
like
schools
and
shopping
centers
increased
between
and
and
over
the
past
two
months
shooters
have
killed
more
than
people
in
texas
ohio
and
california
the
frequency
of
such
attacks
is
wearing
on
investigators
and
government
officials
i
think
it
is
frustrating
for
all
of
us
in
law
enforcement
that
we
keep
having
to
do
this
combs
said
for
the
fbi
in
particular
we
do
them
across
the
country
as
a
service
to
our
state
and
local
partners
it's
just
getting
worse
investigators
are
getting
at
least
some
help
from
the
public
the
fbi
reported
a
spike
in
tips
after
an
alleged
white
nationalist
fatally
shot
people
in
el
paso
on
aug
and
authorities
have
since
arrested
more
than
people
as
potential
mass
shooters
meanwhile
however
texas
is
making
it
easier
to
access
guns
despite
having
been
home
to
four
of
the
deadliest
mass
shootings
in
modern
u.s.
history
within
hours
of
the
mass
shooting
in
west
texas
a
series
of
laws
passed
by
the
state
legislature
earlier
this
year
which
loosen
gun
restrictions
went
into
effect
including
a
law
that
allows
weapons
on
school
grounds
as
well
as
in
churches
and
apartments

greg
abbott
r
said
he
was
tired
of
seeing
the
violence
in
his
state
but
hours
later
he
oversaw
and
defended
the
relaxed
gun
restrictions
i
have
been
to
too
many
of
these
events
he
said
i
am
heartbroken
by
the
crying
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
texas
i
am
tired
of
the
dying
of
the
people
of
texas
too
many
texans
are
in
mourning
too
many
texans
have
lost
their
lives
the
status
quo
in
texas
is
unacceptable
and
action
is
needed
correction
an
earlier
version
of
this
story
erroneously
stated
that
texas
new
gun
laws
were
passed
over
the
weekend
they
went
into
effect
over
the
weekend
they
were
passed
earlier
this
