trump
doesn't
know
whether
he's
ever
heard
of
a
category
storm
hurricane
dorian
is
the
fourth
storm
of
that
magnitude
to
develop
during
his
presidency
as
hurricane
dorian
hurtled
toward
the
u.s.
coastline
on
sunday
president
donald
trump
expressed
shock
over
its
category
status
claiming
to
be
unsure
of
whether
he
had
heard
of
such
a
term
despite
the
fact
that
it's
the
fourth
storm
of
that
magnitude
to
develop
during
his
tenure
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
ever
even
heard
of
a
category
he
told
federal
emergency
management
agency
officials
i
knew
it
existed
and
i've
seen
some
category
s
you
don't
even
see
them
that
much
but
a
category
is
something
that
i
don't
know
that
i've
ever
even
heard
the
term
other
than
i
know
it's
there
that's
the
ultimate
and
that's
what
we
have
unfortunately
trump
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
ever
heard
of
a
category
this
is
the
fourth
category
hurricane
to
strike
the
united
states
during
his
presidency
