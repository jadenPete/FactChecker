olive
garden
denies
rumors
it
donated
to
donald

reelection
campaign
boycottolivegarden
trended
over
the
weekend
after
the
restaurant
chain
was
baselessly
included
in
a
list
of
trump-backing
companies
a
social
media
hashtag
calling
for
a
boycott
of
restaurant
chain
olive
garden
went
viral
over
the
weekend
after
an
apparently
baseless
rumor
that
the
brand
had
donated
to
president
donald
trump's
reelection
campaign
olive
garden
a
subsidiary
of
darden
restaurants
inc
has
since
set
the
record
straight
and
said
no
it
doesn't
donate
to
presidential
candidates
on
sunday
boycottolivegarden
was
tweeted
thousands
of
times
after
two
tweets
that
apparently
inaccurately
called
out
the
chain
for
alleged
trump
contributions
as
boycotts
against
fitness
chains
equinox
and
soulcycle
show
anti-trump
consumers
can
be
quick
to
express
their
displeasure
with
corporate
titans
involvement
in
politics
olive
garden
however
appears
different
on
aug
a
twitter
user
shared
a
list
of
restaurants
allegedly
backing
trump's
reelection
naming
brands
like
olive
garden
kfc
and
wendy's
it
was
retweeted
nearly
times
however
the
source
the
twitter
user
shared
for
chick-fil-a
for
example
opensecrets
org
contains
a
statement
that
reads
the
organizations
themselves
did
not
donate
rather
the
money
came
from
the
organizations
pacs
their
individual
members
or
employees
or
owners
and
those
individuals
immediate
families
the
twitter
user
didn't
cite
a
source
for
the
olive
garden
claim
nevertheless
another
twitter
user
over
the
weekend
called
out
olive
garden
specifically
that
tweet
helped
spark
a
boycottolivegarden
movement
olive
garden's
official
twitter
account
responded
but
the
company's
denial
didn't
gain
nearly
as
much
traction
as
the
initial
claim
when
asked
by
huffpost
for
further
comment
olive
garden's
press
team
sent
an
email
repeating
the
statement
that
representatives
don't
know
where
this
information
came
from
and
the
company
doesn't
donate
to
presidential
candidates
the
moral
here
go
get
yourself
some
damn
breadsticks
