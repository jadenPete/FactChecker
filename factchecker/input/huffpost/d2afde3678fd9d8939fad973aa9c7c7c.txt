in
the
end
no
one
wanted
a
me
too
presidential
candidate
what
to
make
of
kirsten
gillibrand's
failure
to
launch
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
d-n
y.
tried
to
be
the
women's
rights
candidate
for
the
me
too
era
but
the
only
me
too
issue
anyone
wanted
to
talk
about
involved
just
one
man
the
former
senator
from
minnesota
al
franken
on
wednesday
evening
after
missing
the
cutoff
to
qualify
for
the
september
democratic
debate
gillibrand
dropped
her
bid
for
the
democratic
nomination
famously
gillibrand
was
the
first
senator
to
call
for
franken's
resignation
in
december
the
popular
democrat
was
facing
multiple
accusations
of
sexual
misconduct
at
the
height
of
the
me
too
era
she's
been
fielding
franken
questions
ever
since
consider
just
last
week
gillibrand
held
a
town
hall
on
reproductive
rights
in
missouri
a
battleground
for
abortion
rights
no
national
media
covered
the
event
two
days
later
however
the
new
york
times
podcast
the
daily
devoted
an
entire
segment
to
gillibrand
nearly
minutes
centered
entirely
on
what
transpired
with
franken
and
whether
she
had
any
regrets
about
it
she
was
asked
about
franken
in
national
interviews
at
least
times
this
year
according
to
a
campaign
aide
gillibrand's
campaign
failed
for
a
host
of
reasons
the
field
was
crowded
and
competitive
and
she
just
didn't
have
the
big
breakout
moments
of
some
of
her
rivals
nor
did
she
come
into
the
race
with
national
name
recognition
but
it's
worth
looking
at
gillibrand's
exit
through
the
lens
of
the
platform
she
tried
to
run
on
women's
rights
and
gender
equality
her
campaign
was
something
of
a
referendum
on
the
me
too
era
and
a
test
of
the
limits
of
what
a
female
candidate
is
allowed
to
be
in
the
political
world
is
still
having
a
sad
and
self-reinforcing
argument
about
electability
and
whether
the
country
is
ready
for
a
woman
president
it's
hard
not
to
look
at
what
happened
with
gillibrand
and
see
that
there's
still
a
lot
of
anxiety
around
the
idea
of
a
truly
powerful
woman
especially
one
who
is
willing
to
stand
up
to
a
powerful
man
we're
treading
on
a
lot
of
deeply
entrenched
misogyny
right
now
said
ilyse
hogue
president
of
naral
prochoice
america
women
who
stick
their
necks
out
to
challenge
the
entrenched
systems
that
benefit
men
are
rarely
rewarded
for
it
personally
hogue
emphatically
disagreed
that
gillibrand's
campaign
was
any
kind
of
barometer
for
women's
rights
more
broadly
in
fact
she
sees
as
a
crucial
moment
for
women
the
election
will
be
studied
as
one
that
was
completely
pivotal
for
the
conversation
about
women's
status
in
american
society
there's
no
question
she
said
that's
not
just
because
we
have
five
women
running
it's
everything
that
came
before
it
hogue
listed
the
emergence
of
me
too
the
fight
over
brett
kavanaugh's
nomination
the
assault
on
reproductive
rights
for
starters
gillibrand
didn't
break
through
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
most
of
these
democratic
contenders
aren't
polling
well
hogue
said
in
a
large
field
candidates
without
a
national
brand
are
struggling
gillibrand
is
a
retail
politician
who
built
power
locally
and
was
at
a
disadvantage
rebecca
katz
a
democratic
strategist
put
it
bluntly
she
wasn't
the
best
candidate
she
said
for
voters
who
care
about
electing
a
woman
there
are
plenty
of
options
right
now
with
a
field
of
this
many
women
i
think
it
was
hard
for
gillibrand
to
talk
about
coming
from
off
the
sidelines
when
so
many
women
were
off
the
sidelines
already
said
katz
referring
to
the
name
of
the
new
york
senator's
dormant
political
committee
devoted
to
electing
women
on
wednesday
gillibrand
said
she'd
revive
the
group
we
have
to
defeat
president
trump
flip
the
senate
and
elect
women
up
and
down
the
ballot
she
said
even
without
franken
hovering
over
her
campaign
gillibrand
likely
didn't
have
a
shot
when
you
look
at
the
front-runners
when
you
look
at
their
records
even
absent
calling
for
franken's
resignation
it's
hard
to
see
how
she'd
make
it
into
the
top
tier
said
jennifer
lawless
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
virginia
the
franken
incident
if
anything
kept
gillibrand
in
the
conversation
lawless
added
the
media
was
always
going
to
be
fascinated
by
what
happened
a
powerful
woman
taking
down
a
powerful
man
is
irresistibly
interesting
news
if
it's
a
powerful
man
taking
down
a
powerful
man
then
it's
like
eh
it's
a
monday
she
said
nearly
two
years
ago
not
long
after
the
new
york
times
published
its
harvey
weinstein
expose
coming
out
against
franken
looked
like
a
winning
political
move
republicans
were
the
party
of
sexual
assault
with
donald
trump
at
the
helm
roy
moore
accused
of
preying
on
young
girls
was
running
for
one
of
alabama's
senate
seats
to
distinguish
the
party
the
democrats
had
to
go
after
franken
nearly
three
dozen
democratic
senators
joined
gillibrand's
call
for
his
resignation
since
then
me
too
has
faded
somewhat
from
the
political
conversation
the
problem
is
it's
two
years
later
and
the
political
environment
has
changed
i
think
the
discussion
around
me
too
and
sexual
harassment
has
changed
as
well
said
lawless
of
course
there
was
an
obsession
over
the
fall
of
franken
who
it's
worth
emphasizing
voluntarily
resigned
it's
hard
to
talk
about
because
it's
really
uncomfortable
but
american
people
low-key
don't
like
women
said
sean
mcelwee
co-founder
of
data
for
progress
a
progressive
nonprofit
mcelwee
says
the
franken
incident
was
just
one
small
reason
for
the
new
york
senator's
failure
to
launch
if
voters
did
hear
about
it
their
reaction
was
more
of
fatigue
he
said
it's
a
women
are
still
whining
about
this
stuff
reaction
from
voters
the
race
so
far
has
been
about
a
lot
of
issues
trump
health
care
the
economy
climate
change
even
busing
a
political
issue
from
the
s
got
its
moment
in
the
sun
me
too
not
so
much
sexual
discrimination
harassment
and
assault
haven't
come
up
in
the
democratic
debates
there
was
a
single
question
about
the
pay
gap
in
the
first
debate
while
there's
little
question
the
contenders
are
supporters
of
women's
rights
joe
biden's
hair
sniffing
aside
there's
been
little
substantive
discussion
over
what
that
support
looks
like
what
policy
would
best
serve
to
ensure
women
are
treated
equally
in
the
workplace
what
should
the
consequences
be
for
sexual
harassers
what's
the
best
policy
to
ensure
that
the
workplace
is
free
from
discrimination
there's
been
no
back-and-forth
on
these
issues
democrats
made
themselves
the
standard
bearers
on
metoo
issues
practically
shoving
al
franken
out
of
the
senate
but
you
wouldn't
know
it
from
the
way
their
campaign
to
defeat
trump
has
played
out
so
far
alexi
mccammond
wrote
last
week
in
axios
that's
actually
not
surprising
the
me
too
era
has
triggered
all
kinds
of
anxiety
about
women
taking
on
powerful
men
a
majority
of
men
now
say
they're
reluctant
to
even
mentor
or
work
with
women
according
to
a
recent
survey
arguably
at
this
point
there's
been
more
ink
spilled
over
how
men's
lives
have
been
ruined
by
me
too
than
discussion
over
the
consequences
women
face
when
they
speak
up
for
themselves
in
a
field
with
several
other
female
candidates
gillibrand's
pitch
was
even
less
likely
to
land
the
year-old
senator
initially
centered
her
campaign
on
her
identity
as
a
mother
i'm
going
to
run
for
president
of
the
united
states
because
as
a
young
mom
i'm
going
to
fight
for
other
people's
kids
as
hard
as
i
would
fight
for
my
own
she
said
on
the
late
show
with
stephen
colbert
in
january
announcing
she
was
forming
a
presidential
exploratory
committee
but
she
was
outflanked
on
the
mom
strategy
pretty
quickly
by
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
who
drew
a
lot
of
attention
the
following
month
with
a
sweeping
plan
for
child
care
warren
expertly
connected
her
policy
to
her
experience
as
a
young
mother
recalling
how
her
aunt
bee
swooped
in
at
the
last
minute
and
offered
to
help
her
katz
said
in
march
with
the
official
launch
of
her
campaign
gillibrand
pivoted
away
from
the
mom
strategy
and
leaned
in
to
a
new
slogan
be
brave
the
announcement
was
overshadowed
by
the
release
of
the
mueller
report
and
the
moniker
also
had
the
effect
of
calling
up
the
franken
moment
again
in
the
end
there
was
little
oxygen
or
appetite
left
for
her
to
have
a
substantive
conversation
about
sexual
harassment
or
discrimination
really
owning
sexual
assault
and
harassment
should've
been
a
positive
distinguishing
factor
for
gillibrand
said
shaunna
thomas
co-founder
of
ultraviolet
a
women's
advocacy
group
we
didn't
even
get
there
because
we
were
so
busy
talking
about
the
process
that
led
to
al
franken
resigning
yes
there
is
much
to
be
excited
about
for
women
in
politics
women
have
brought
new
energy
to
the
democratic
party
there
was
the
women's
march
the
wave
of
congresswomen
elected
in
now
one
of
the
leading
contenders
for
the
democratic
nomination
is
warren
sens
kamala
harris
calif
and
amy
klobuchar
minn
will
be
on
the
debate
stage
in
september
reproductive
rights
are
on
the
agenda
in
a
real
and
specific
way
partly
because
gillibrand
took
a
hard-line
stance
on
abortion
early
on
she
successfully
pushed
the
entire
field
to
commit
to
defending
the
civil
rights
of
women
meredith
kelly
gillibrand's
communications
director
told
huffpost
gillibrand
on
wednesday
said
she'd
ultimately
endorse
a
democratic
candidate
for
president
and
stopped
just
short
of
telling
the
new
york
times
that
candidate
would
be
a
woman
i
think
that
women
have
a
unique
ability
to
bring
people
together
and
heal
this
country
she
said
i
think
a
woman
nominee
would
be
inspiring
and
exciting
