the

as
snark
and
responded
with
criticism
of
the
trump
administration's
anti-environment
agenda
as
there
are
in
puerto

sorry
you

snark-
but
trump's
indifference
to
suffering
is
intolerable
wd
also
help
if
he
tackled
climate
change
which
is
making
hurricanes
more
destructive
instead
he

remove
limits
