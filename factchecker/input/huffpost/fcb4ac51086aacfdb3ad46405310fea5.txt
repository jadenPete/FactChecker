the
top
asylum
official
at
u.s.
citizenship
and
immigration
services
has
reportedly
been
reassigned
to
a
service
center
in
virginia
an
apparent
demotion
lambasted
by
some
immigration
officials
as
just
another
attack
by
the
trump
administration
on
the
asylum
system
john
lafferty
who
led
the
uscis
asylum
division
for
six
years
was
pushed
out
this
week
by
ken
cuccinelli
the
agency's
hard-line
acting
director
according
to
buzzfeed
which
first
reported
the
news
the
asylum
division
under
lafferty
had
long
been
a
source
of
frustration
to
the
trump
administration
particularly
senior
white
house
adviser
stephen
miller
according
to
the
washington
post
miller
whose
own
great-grandfather
was
a
refugee
has
been
pushing
a
hard-line
immigration
agenda
since
the
early
days
of
the
trump
campaign
he's
sought
to
limit
the
number
of
asylum-seekers
allowed
into
the
u.s.
allegedly
even
telling
former
trump
aide
cliff
sims
that
he'd
be
happy
if
not
a
single
refugee
foot
ever
again
touched
america's
soil
trump
who
has
made
anti-immigration
policies
a
signature
of
his
presidency
has
repeatedly
railed
against
the
u.s.
asylum
program
which
he
called
a
scam
earlier
this
year
lafferty
is
a
pro-asylum
official
who
was
well-liked
in
his
division
a
uscis
officer
told
the
post
he
clearly
respected
their
work
and
you
could
tell
he
wasn't
too
enthused
about
the
various
new
policies
under
the
trump
administration
in
july
buzzfeed
reported
that
lafferty
had
penned
a
memo
to
staffers
critical
of
a
fast-tracked
trump
administration
policy
that
ended
asylum
protections
for
migrants
who
transited
through
another
country
before
arriving
in
the
u.s.
we
are
once
again
being
asked
to
adapt
and
to
do
so
with
very
little
time
to
train
and
prepare
lafferty
wrote
at
the
time
if
i
didn't
know
that
we
have
some
of
the
most
dedicated
most
adaptable
and
most
talented
public
servants
presently
serving
in
the
federal
government
i
would
be
concerned
about
being
able
to
implement
these
changes
on
such
short
notice
it's
unclear
if
the
memo
was
linked
in
any
way
to
lafferty's
reassignment
starting
on
sept
lafferty
will
become
deputy
director
of
the
potomac
service
center
in
arlington
where
he'll
oversee
the
processing
of
applications
for
permanent
residency
and
work
permits
for
international
students
politico
reported
a
uscis
spokesperson
did
not
specifically
comment
on
lafferty's
reassignment
but
told
buzzfeed
the
agency
has
a
mobile
group
of
senior
executives
who
qualify
for
a
variety
of
positions
uscis
has
the
authority
the
spokesperson
added
to
move
these
managers
to
different
roles
to
best
serve
the
agency
several
uscis
officers
expressed
concern
at
lafferty's
role
change
this
is
just
another
attack
on
the
asylum
system
one
immigration
official
told
buzzfeed
to
remove
someone
with
his
knowledge
of
and
history
with
the
program
will
cause
damage
another
uscis
official
told
the
outlet
that
lafferty's
departure
was
shocking
and
distressing
news
for
the
civil
servants
who
work
in
the
asylum
division
that
official
described
lafferty
as
an
incredibly
sophisticated
highly
dedicated
and
ethical
leader
according
to
politico
lafferty
will
be
replaced
in
an
acting
capacity
by
andrew
