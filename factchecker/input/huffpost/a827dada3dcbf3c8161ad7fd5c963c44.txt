impeachment
summer
passes
by
without
a
breakthrough
more
democrats
support
investigating
and
ousting
trump
now
than
did
at
the
beginning
of
august
recess
but
it's
unlikely
to
top
congress
fall
agenda
schnecksville
pa
rep
susan
wild
a
freshman
democrat
elected
to
a
blue-tinted
swing
seat
representing
the
lehigh
valley
knew
the
question
was
coming
congresswoman
why
have
you
not
come
out
for
impeachment
the
president
of
a
local
community
college
serving
as
the
event's
moderator
asked
wild
any
of
you
who
ever
heard
me
on
the
campaign
trail
heard
me
say
i'm
not
going
to
jump
on
a
bandwagon
on
any
issue
wild
told
the
crowd
of
about
before
citing
her
year
career
as
a
litigator
you
don't
want
to
try
a
case
where
the
facts
are
not
all
lined
up
and
you're
ready
with
all
of
your
evidence
that
you're
going
to
introduce
i
don't
believe
we
are
there
at
this
point
in
time
her
answer
which
she
had
given
before
was
met
with
a
smattering
of
light
applause
similar
scenes
have
played
out
across
the
united
states
during
the
august
congressional
recess
a
coalition
of
progressive
groups
kicked
off
congress
month-long
break
by
promising
an
impeachment
august
aiming
to
break
through
democratic
congressional
leadership's
refusal
to
start
the
process
of
removing
president
donald
trump
from
office
their
position
that
trump's
behavior
outlined
in
the
public
eye
and
the
report
of
special
counsel
robert
mueller
is
equal
to
obstruction
of
justice
or
worse
and
that
he
should
be
removed
from
office
has
the
backing
of
a
majority
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
and
most
of
the
leading
presidential
contenders
as
congress
prepares
to
return
to
washington
and
legislative
work
this
month
they've
made
some
progress
additional
house
democrats
have
come
out
in
favor
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
since
the
start
of
recess
but
the
type
of
groundswell
necessary
to
put
impeaching
the
president
at
the
top
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
agenda
has
proved
elusive
in
total
house
democrats
plus
republican-turned-independent
justin
amash
support
starting
the
impeachment
process
trump
according
to
huffpost's
tally
some
of
those
members
who
have
newly
embraced
impeachment
like
illinois
rep
lauren
underwood
come
from
house
democrats
vaunted
freshman
class
and
are
the
republican
targets
who
moderate
democrats
claim
would
face
political
danger
in
if
impeachment
went
forward
underwood
and
new
hampshire
rep
chris
pappas
are
the
only
two
democrats
representing
districts
trump
won
in
who
support
launching
a
formal
impeachment
probe
another
member
rep
ben
ray
lujan
is
the
highest-ranking
member
of
the
house
to
support
the
effort
lujan
the
assistant
speaker
is
fourth
in
democratic
leadership
others
including
rhode
island
rep
jim
langevin
and
illinois
rep
bill
foster
specifically
said
they
were
supporting
impeachment
because
their
constituents
wanted
it
you're
starting
to
see
people
who
are
a
little
more
cautious
a
little
more
moderate
and
i
think
that's
a
bit
of
a
breakthrough
for
this
movement
said
meagan
hatcher-mays
the
director
of
democracy
policy
at
indivisible
one
of
the
groups
behind
impeachment
august
even
if
activists
weren't
able
to
convince
their
representatives
to
back
impeachment
just
showing
up
at
town
halls
counts
as
a
victory
hatcher-mays
said
being
there
at
all
is
the
most
important
thing
because
that
eliminates
the
excuse
that
i'm
not
hearing
from
my
constituents
on
this
or
this
isn't
important
to
my
district
but
there
are
still
plenty
of
members
like
wild
who
are
resisting
a
call
for
impeachment
and
only
facing
minimal
blowback
from
voters
so
far
maine
rep
jared
golden
a
freshman
elected
to
a
rural
district
in
maine
won
by
president
trump
told
a
local
paper
that
he
held
a
town
hall
where
no
one
asked
about
impeachment
which
he
called
a
type
of
bs
that
i
think
drives
the
silent
majority
of
americans
absolutely
insane
wild
wasn't
quite
as
caustic
about
impeachment
supporters
and
acknowledged
she
received
frequent
calls
and
emails
pushing
her
in
that
direction
but
she
said
she's
typically
able
to
satiate
impeachment
backers
with
her
answer
usually
i
get
very
positive
responses
when
i
answer
exactly
the
way
i
did
which
is
you
know
i
don't
think
we've
got
the
facts
lined
up
i
don't
think
the
evidence
is
there
she
said
if
we're
going
to
go
through
this
process
we
have
to
have
enough
facts
and
evidence
that
we
at
least
convince
the
court
of
public
opinion
that
the
impeachment
route
was
the
right
way
to
go
i
just
don't
think
we're
there
yet
wild
could
in
theory
more
easily
come
out
for
impeachment
than
many
other
freshman
members
while
her
seat
is
not
entirely
safe
she
won
her
race
by
percentage
points
and
has
embraced
other
progressive
priorities
like
medicare
for
all
but
has
so
far
declined
to
back
impeachment
a
monmouth
university
poll
conducted
during
recess
backs
up
much
of
wild's
read
on
the
situation
while
trump
remains
broadly
unpopular
just
percent
of
american
adults
approve
of
his
job
performance
there's
little
evidence
of
popular
demand
for
impeachment
just
percent
of
americans
say
he
should
be
impeached
and
compelled
to
leave
the
presidency
compared
to
percent
who
think
he
should
not
those
numbers
indicate
a
dip
in
support
for
impeachment
since
march
when
percent
said
he
should
be
impeachment
and
forced
to
leave
office
and
percent
said
he
shouldn't
and
while
both
progressives
and
republicans
have
suggested
moderate
democrats
could
face
electoral
peril
depending
on
their
stance
on
ousting
trump
the
same
poll
also
showed
a
plurality
of
registered
voters
said
how
their
member
of
congress
voted
on
impeachment
would
have
no
impact
on
whether
or
not
they
would
back
that
member
in
minnesota
rep
angie
craig
another
freshly
elected
democrat
held
a
town
hall
in
a
high
school
lecture
hall
in
lakeville
a
suburb
some
miles
south
of
minneapolis
she
said
she
was
incredibly
concerned
about
the
obstruction
of
justice
detailed
in
the
mueller
report
but
still
wanted
to
see
more
information
i
want
to
reserve
the
right
to
calmly
and
dispassionately
look
at
all
of
the
information
and
if
someone
asks
me
to
take
a
vote
then
i'll
take
a
vote
craig
told
huffpost
but
i
think
my
district
is
best
served
by
remaining
focused
on
health
care
infrastructure
helping
our
family
farmers
and
advocating
for
special
ed
wild
similarly
told
her
constituents
she
was
focused
on
what
some
people
would
call
more
mundane
issues
still
some
attendees
of
craig's
town
hall
were
hopeful
they
could
persuade
the
congresswoman
who
defeated
republican
jason
lewis
a
frequently
controversial
former
radio
host
in
after
losing
to
him
two
years
earlier
this
is
part
of
what
i
was
afraid
of
that
she
would
try
and
be
more
centrist
than
i
like
said
laura
morton
a
physical
therapist
who
questioned
craig
on
impeachment
during
the
town
hall
morton
said
she
voted
for
craig
in
the
general
election
after
backing
a
more
progressive
candidate
in
the
democratic
primary
i'd
like
her
to
be
more
public
and
more
vocal
and
take
a
stand
in
support
of
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
that
would
lead
to
televised
hearings
rep
andy
kim
who
won
a
district
covering
a
broad
swath
of
southern
new
jersey
by
just
votes
held
a
town
hall
the
day
after
wild
and
craig
held
theirs
in
a
middle
school
auditorium
the
only
signs
of
the
divisions
and
buzzwords
shaping
national
politics
were
a
row
of
single-payer
health
care
activists
holding
fight
to
win
medicare
for
all
placards
and
a
man
wearing
a
red
make
america
great
again
baseball
hat
that
was
all
right
with
kim
a
former
obama
administration
national
security
official
who
said
his
constituents
in
the
south
jersey
swing
seat
are
frustrated
as
much
by
partisan
gridlock
as
advancing
any
particular
legislative
priority
the
town
hall
was
dominated
by
discussion
of
decommissioning
the
town's
oyster
creek
nuclear
energy
plant
and
impeachment
never
came
up
a
huge
part
of
this
district
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
they
want
adults
back
in
the
room
who
can
talk
to
each
other
and
deal
with
issues
of
people's
daily
lives
and
understand
full
well
that
they'll
leave
that
room
without
percent
of
what
they
wanted
going
in
kim
told
reporters
after
the
town
hall
it's
more
the
atmosphere
in
washington
the
lack
of
progress
the
fact
that
they
just
can't
depend
on
anything
getting
done
