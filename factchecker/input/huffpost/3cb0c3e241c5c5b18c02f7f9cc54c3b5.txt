saturday
an

everything
to
defeat
the
singular
evil
of

khan
wrote
in
the
observer
to
mark
the
th
anniversary
of
the
nazi
invasion
of
poland
that
launched
world
war
ii
but
now
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
years
it
seems
the
lessons
of
the
second
world
war
are
genuinely
at
risk
of
being
forgotten
or
worse
still
being
rewritten
he
added

orb
n
has
systematically
destroyed
the
independence
of
both
the
judiciary
and
the
press
institutions
that
are
also
under
daily
verbal
attack
from
trump
and
other
far-right
leaders
around
the
world
khan
noted
we
owe
it
those
lost
in
world
war
ii
to
defend
the
ideals
they
died
for
and
ensure
that
the
more
peaceful
and
stable
world
they
built
lasts
for
generations
to
come
he
declared
there
was
no
immediate
response
from
trump
but
he
has
blasted
khan
several
times
in
the
past
including
insulting
him
as
a
stone-cold
loser
as
the
president
headed
to
london
for
a
state
visit
in
june
