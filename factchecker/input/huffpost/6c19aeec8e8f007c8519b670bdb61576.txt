mcconnell
rails
against
moscow
mitch
nickname
it's
over
the
top
the
senate
majority
leader
voiced
frustration
over
the
moniker
given

for
blocking

security
bills
moscow
mitch
has
gained
traction
as
a
nickname
for
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
and
the
powerful
kentucky
republican
is
none
too
happy
about
that
in
an
interview
tuesday
with
conservative
radio
host
hugh
hewitt
mcconnell
decried
the
alliterative
sobriquet
given
him
by
critics
after
he
stymied
senate
consideration
of
two
election
security
bills
the
label
he
complained
is
a
political
smear
it's
modern-day
mccarthyism
he
said
unbelievable
for
a
cold
warrior
like
me
who
spent
a
career
standing
up
to
the
russians
to
be
given
a
moniker
like
that
it's
an
effort
to
smear
me
referring
to
a
previous
tag
he
had
earned
for
thwarting
other
bills
he
said
you
know
i
can
laugh
about
things
like
the
grim
reaper
but
calling
me
moscow
mitch
is
over
the
top
in
july
mcconnell
thwarted
a
house-passed
measure
that
sought
to
authorize
million
to
fortify
state
election
systems
and
require
paper
ballots
for
added
security
he
also
blocked
a
separate
proposal
that
would
have
required
candidates
as
well
as
their
staffers
and
family
members
to
alert
federal
authorities
if
offered
aid
by
foreign
governments
a
measure
sparked
by
the
various
revelations
into
russian
interference
in
the
u.s.
election
msnbc
host
joe
scarborough
derided
the
senator
the
next
day
dubbing
him
moscow
mitch
and
the
nickname
was
born
within
hours
it
began
trending
on
twitter
even
inspiring
a
song
from
rock
musician
ben
folds
who
performed
the
tune
at
a
show
in
new
york
it
also
followed
him
home
with
opponents
chanting
it
as
he
tried
to
speak
at
a
political
picnic
a
few
weeks
ago
in
fancy
farm
kentucky
continuing
to
voice
his
frustration
over
his
inability
to
shake
the
tag
mcconnell
told
hewitt
it's
a
product
of
what
we're
up
against
with
the
hard
left
today
in
america
washington
post
columnist
dana
milbank
had
also
taken
mcconnell
to
task
just
after
he
senator
blocked
action
on
the
election
security
bills
calling
him
a
russian
asset
in
a
searing
op-ed
let's
call
this
what
it
is
unpatriotic
milbank
wrote
the
kentucky
republican
is
arguably
more
than
any
other
american
doing
russian
president
vladimir
putin's
bidding
a
visibly
enraged
mcconnell
responded
with
a
defensive
senate
floor
speech
at
the
end
of
july
dismissing
both
scarborough
and
milbank
as
hyperventilating
hacks
it's
like
an
inflationary
crisis
but
with
outrage
instead
of
dollars
he
said
mcconnell's
sensitivity
to
the
nickname
may
stem
in
part
from
a
potentially
spirited
democratic
challenge
to
his
bid
for
a
seventh
term
in
the
election
