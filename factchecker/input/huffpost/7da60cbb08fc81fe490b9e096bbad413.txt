trump
insists
his
hurricane
warning
was
right
even
after
nws
corrected
him
the
president
incorrectly
warned
alabama
then
attacked
a
reporter
who
pointed
it
out
president
donald
trump
on
monday
insisted
he
was
right
to
warn
alabama
of
a
nonexistent
hurricane
threat
and
attacked
a
tv
reporter
who
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
state
was
not
at
risk
from
dorian
such
a
phony
hurricane
report
he
declared
on
twitter
as
he
railed
at
jon
karl
of
abc
news
for
reporting
on
his
erroneous
warning
trump
had
claimed
in
a
tweet
on
sunday
that
florida
south
carolina
north
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
will
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
he
made
a
similar
claim
about
alabama
in
televised
comments
the
false
alarm
caused
the
national
weather
service
to
issue
a
correction
albeit
without
mentioning
the
president
about
minutes
after
trump's
warning
the
agency
tweeted
the
president
said
on
monday
that
he
was
right
because
alabama
was
facing
a
hurricane
threat
under
certain
original
scenarios
however
trump
on
sunday
did
not
refer
to
certain
original
scenarios
but
instead
said
after
a
federal
emergency
management
agency
briefing
that
this
just
came
up
unfortunately
as
he
spoke
about
a
supposed
threat
to
alabama
in
reality
the
projections
at
that
point
did
not
show
any
path
that
would
bring
the
storm
to
alabama
dorian
was
instead
tracking
further
east
the
storm
is
currently
off
the
coast
of
florida
and
expected
to
move
along
the
coast
with
florida
georgia
south
carolina
north
carolina
and
virginia
all
facing
potential
threat
in
the
coming
days
twitter
users
called
out
the
president
for
trying
to
save
face
instead
of
focusing
on
ensuring
correct
emergency
information
gets
to
the
people
who
need
it
