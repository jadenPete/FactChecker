welcome
trump
baby
blimp
after
president
scraps
denmark
trip
danes
have
a
blast
mocking
president
who
ducked
out
after
his
plan
to
buy
greenland
was
slapped
down
as
absurd
when
president
donald
trump
cancelled
his
trip
to
denmark
after
he
was
scolded
by
officials
for
presuming
he
could
buy
greenland
protesters
looked
forward
instead
to
rallying
around
the
trump
baby
blimp
the
fact
he
isn't
coming
doesn't
change
our
agenda
which
is
to
make
a
lot
of
noise
and
draw
attention
to
how
annoying
trump
is
and
how
much
he
acts
like
a
child
activist
morten
skovgaard
told
politiken
various
groups
on
monday
protested
trump's
sabotage
of
the
global
fight
against
climate
change
and
his
racist
and
discriminatory
policies
said
a
facebook
event
description
the
blimp
floated
over
a
central
copenhagen
square
and
demonstrators
gathered
outside
the
u.s.
embassy
a
danish
computer
games
entrepreneur
nicholas
francis
agreed
to
cover
the
costs
of
the
protest
estimated
by
skovgaard
be
more
than
bloomberg
reported
trump
was
annoyed
last
month
after
his
idea
to
buy
greenland
was
mocked
by
various
officials
as
grotesque
ridiculous
and
final
proof
that
trump
had
gone
mad
greenland
is
not
for
sale
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
finally
flatly
told
the
danish
newspaper
sermitsiaq
about
the
autonomous
danish
territory
greenland
is
not
danish
greenland
belongs
to
greenland
i
strongly
hope
that
this
is
not
meant
seriously
she
called
the
discussion
absurd
trump
then
cancelled
his
planned
trip
to
denmark
which
was
supposed
happen
monday
and
tuesday
he
call
frederiksen's
comments
nasty
a
word
he
particularly
uses
for
women
who
cross
him
denmark
i
looked
forward
to
going
but
i
thought
that
the
prime
minister's
statement
that
it
was
absurd
was
nasty
he
told
reporters
