zinged
president
donald
trump
in
a
tweet
thursday
mocking
the
desperation
of
his
raid
on
the
pentagon's
budget
to
finally
build
his
southern
border
wall
that
no
one
else
will
pay
for
to
no
one's
surprise
trump
failed
to
get
any
funds
from
mexico
despite
his
vow
to
do
so
during
his
presidential
campaign
he
was
also
unable
to
wrest
money
from
congress
so
the
president
declared
a
national
emergency
early
this
year
in
order
to
use
pentagon
funds
even
though
he
admitted
in
a
speech
at
the
time
i
didn't
need
to
do
this
but
i'd
rather
do
it
faster
the
billion
money-grab
will
be
pulled
from
international
and
domestic
construction
and
maintenance
projects
for
the
defense
department
and
from
education
for
the
children
of
service
members
projects
affected
will
include
facilities
used
to
store
hazardous
waste
repair
navy
ships
and
conduct
cyber-operations
in
states
three
u.s.
territories
and
countries
puerto
rico
which
is
continually
bashed
by
trump
will
lose
about
million
in
funds
cnn
reported
the
pentagon
is
already
pleading
with
congress
to
replace
the
money
that's
being
shifted
to
the
border
according
to
the
associated
press
the
funding
switch
was
attacked
by
democrats
and
republicans
sen
mike
lee
r-utah
complained
that
congress
has
been
ceding
far
too
much
powers
to
the
executive
branch
for
decades
and
it
is
far
past
time
for
congress
to
restore
the
proper
balance
of
power
even
republicans
who
backed
trump's
emergency
move
have
found
that
their
states
will
sacrifice
millions
in
funding

diverting
funds
meant
to
support
u.s.
national
security
interests
so
that
he
can
build
a
border
wall
only
makes
us
less
safe
sen
mark

d-va
said
in
a
statement
taking
money
away
from
our
military
will
mean
we
are
less
equipped
to
tackle
threats
here
at
home
and
abroad
critics
on
twitter
had
a
few
things
to
say
about
