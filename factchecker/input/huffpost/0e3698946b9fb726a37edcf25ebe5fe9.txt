gets
its
moment

climate
town
hall
democratic
presidential
candidates
vow
to
make
federal
land
part
of
the
climate
solution
a
federal

last

found
that
about
a
quarter
of
all
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
united
states
come
from
fossil
fuel
extraction
on
federal
land
as
the
trump
administration
continues
its
push
to
expand
such
development
top
candidates
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
agree
that
america's
public

must
be
a
tool

the
fight

not
a
contributor
to
the
problem
during

expand
federally
protected
acreage
we
should
not
be
selling
or
leasing
public
land
for
the
purposes
of
drilling
harris
said
banning
such
activity
on
the
federal
estate
castro
said
is
consistent
with
moving
to
sources
of
clean
renewable
energy
instead
of
dirty
fossil-fuel
energy
harris
and
casto
stressed
that
preserving
america's
heritage
would
be
a
priority
if

president
we
actually
need
to
undo
the
damage
that
this
administration
has
done
and
then
expand
the
lands
that
we're
protecting
in
our
country
castro
said
we
can
do
that
along
with

huntley
said
if
we
are
going
to
keep
pace
with
what
science
demands
we
must
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
on
our
public

also
restoring

to
alaska's
