ohio
set
to
remove
more
than
people
from
its
voter
rolls
voting
rights
groups
want
the
state
to
pause
the
removals
noting
that
thousands
of
eligible
voters
are
at
risk
of
having
their
voter
registrations
canceled
ohio
is
set
to
cancel
hundreds
of
thousands
of
voter
registrations
on
friday
even
though
the
list
of
voters
it
is
using
was
found
to
have
mistakes
ohio
secretary
of
state
frank
larose
r
published
a
list
of
voters
at
risk
of
losing
their
registrations
in
august
but
soon
discovered
there
were
errors
and
corrected
them
the
following
month
in
august
voting
rights
groups
said
they
identified
an
additional
people
who
were
incorrectly
added
to
the
list
the
columbus
dispatch
also
reported
more
than
people
who
were
erroneously
added
because
of
a
technical
error
since
early
august
voting
rights
groups
have
been
combing
through
larose's
list
in
a
mad
dash
to
urge
voters
to
check
their
registrations
part
of
that
effort
includes
a
plan
to
text
many
people
on
the
list
to
check
their
voter
records
voting
rights
advocates
say
larose
should
pause
the
removals
to
give
people
more
time
to
check
the
list
there
are
new
questions
it
seems
like
every
week
about
what's
going
on
with
this
list
and
various
inaccuracies
with
the
list
said
mike
brickner
the
ohio
state
director
of
all
voting
is
local
one
of
the
groups
working
on
contacting
voters
if
we're
going
to
purge
people
we
better
make
sure
that
it
be
accurate
and
fair
as
of
right
now
with
new
questions
arising
just
about
every
day
many
people
in
the
state
just
don't
have
a
lot
of
confidence
that
this
is
a
correct
list
the
fight
in
ohio
underscores
how
mass
voter
removals
sometimes
called
voter
purges
are
now
a
major
frontier
in
battles
over
voter
suppression
in
the
united
states
at
least
million
people
have
had
their
voter
registrations
canceled
since
the
election
according
to
one
study
by
the
brennan
center
for
justice
it's
unclear
how
many
of
those
cancellations
were
legitimate
ohio
has
already
canceled
voter
registrations
this
year
voting
rights
groups
say
these
purges
are
discriminatory
inaccurate
and
jeopardize
the
registrations
of
eligible
voters
so
far
people
on
larose's
list
have
updated
their
registrations
so
they
aren't
canceled
in
ohio
the
list
of
voters
set
for
purging
is
made
up
of
people
the
state
suspects
have
moved
some
on
the
list
did
indeed
submit
a
change
of
address
form
to
the
united
states
postal
service
but
others
did
not
the
list
includes
people
who
didn't
respond
to
an
address
confirmation
mailing
and
people
who
haven't
voted
signed
a
petition
or
engaged
in
any
other
political
activity
for
six
consecutive
years
voting
rights
groups
are
concerned
that
this
process
for
removing
people
from
the
voter
rolls
called
the
supplemental
process
in
ohio
is
putting
eligible
voters
at
risk
of
having
their
voter
registrations
canceled
the
ohio
democratic
party
cited
the
errors
last
week
in
a
lawsuit
asking
a
federal
judge
to
halt
the
scheduled
purge
u.s.
district
judge
james
graham
declined
that
request
tuesday
afternoon
graham
noted
in
his
ruling
that
larose
was
ensuring
eligible
voters
weren't
getting
removed
from
the
rolls
when
he
discovered
errors
on
his
list
larose's
office
defended
its
handling
of
the
removals
in
a
court
filing
earlier
this
week
lawyers
representing
his
office
noted
that
errors
had
been
fixed
the
lawyers
also
said
larose
was
taking
additional
steps
to
contact
voters
including
by
making
the
cancellation
list
public
and
sending
an
additional
last
chance
mailing
to
people
on
the
list
we're
proud
of
providing
unprecedented
levels
of
transparency
into
this
process
but
we
won't
ignore
the
law
maggie
sheehan
a
larose
spokesperson
said
in
a
statement
when
we
rolled
out
the
registration
reset
list
in
july
we
partnered
with
the
naacp
the
ohio
republican
party
the
urban
league
church
organizations
and
labor
unions
who
asked
to
be
a
part
of
this
process
and
they've
been
a
big
help
predictably
the
ohio
democratic
party
stood
on
the
sidelines
as
we
prepare
to
finalize
this
process
we're
confident
that
there
has
never
been
a
more
intensive
review
of
ohio's
voting
rolls
and
we're
satisfied
that
the
proper
safeguards
are
in
place
to
ensure
any
eligible
voter
will
have
the
opportunity
to
have
their
voice
heard
she
added
federal
law
requires
states
to
have
a
general
nondiscriminatory
program
to
remove
ineligible
voters
from
their
rolls
the
law
also
states
that
registrants
can't
be
removed
solely
because
they
haven't
voted
larose
says
the
removals
comply
both
with
that
federal
law
and
the
ohio
statute
that
requires
the
supplemental
process
in
a
ruling
last
year
the
united
states
supreme
court
said
ohio's
supplemental
process
was
legal
larose
reached
a
settlement
last
week
with
the
voting
rights
groups
that
brought
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
the
agreement
will
allow
anyone
who
was
purged
using
the
supplemental
process
since
to
cast
a
provisional
ballot
if
they
show
up
at
the
polls
through
any
ohioan
erroneously
removed
from
the
rolls
can
register
to
vote
until
oct
and
be
able
to
cast
a
regular
ballot
in
this
year's
general
election
ohioans
can
check
to
see
if
they
are
at
risk
of
having
their
registration
canceled
