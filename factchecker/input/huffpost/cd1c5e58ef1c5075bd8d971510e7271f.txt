sen
bernie
sanders
a
leading
candidate
for
the
democratic
party's
presidential
nomination
rolled
out
a
sweeping
plan
to
expand
the
rights
of
workers
and
unions
including
giving
federal
employees
the
right
to
strike
making
it
easier
to
form
unions
eliminating
so-called
right-to-work
laws
and
allowing
unions
in
the
same
industry
to
jointly
negotiate
with
employers
sanders
who
is
currently
in
the
top
tier
of
candidates
for
the
party's
nomination
is
competing
for
union
endorsements
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
sen
elizabeth
warren
mass
and
sen
kamala
harris
calif
and
the
plan
could
help
woo
organized
labor
in
the
critical
early
voting
states
of
iowa
new
hampshire
and
nevada
unions
can
provide
crucial
volunteers
and
cash
to
help
put
campaigns
over
the
top
the
plan
is
based
on
the
workplace
democracy
act
legislation
sanders
has
introduced
every
year
since
he
arrived
in
congress
in
there
are
many
reasons
for
the
growing
inequality
in
our
economy
but
one
of
the
most
significant
reasons
for
the
disappearing
middle
class
is
that
the
rights
of
workers
to
join
together
and
bargain
for
better
wages
benefits
and
working
conditions
have
been
severely
undermined
sanders
campaign
wrote
in
rolling
out
the
plan
the
campaign
said
sanders
would
aim
to
double
union
membership
during
his
first
four-year
term
in
office
union
membership
has
long
been
in
decline
in
the
united
states
and
only
about
in
workers
are
members
of
a
union
today
sanders
and
other
progressives
have
long
argued
the
decline
of
unions
has
been
a
leading
driver
of
economic
inequality
unionized
employees
typically
make
more
money
and
are
more
likely
to
have
health
coverage
and
strong
retirement
plans
by
executive
order
sanders
would
require
federal
contractors
to
take
steps
to
make
their
workplaces
more
employee-friendly
they'd
be
barred
from
outsourcing
jobs
paying
their
ceos
more
than
times
what
their
average
worker
makes
and
be
required
to
pay
workers
at
least
an
hour
he'd
also
push
to
give
federal
employees
the
ability
to
strike
for
the
first
time
other
steps
would
require
a
friendly
congress
sanders
would
propose
eliminating
the
section
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
allows
states
to
adopt
right-to-work
laws
that
undermine
unions
he'd
also
seek
to
make
union
organizing
easier
with
majority
sign-up
also
known
as
card
check
his
plan
would
seek
to
bar
corporations
from
forcing
employees
to
attend
anti-union
meetings
and
would
push
for
a
law
guaranteeing
the
ability
of
public
sector
workers
to
collectively
bargain
the
last
provision
could
prove
particularly
popular
in
iowa
in
the
state's
republican-controlled
government
passed
a
law
that
said
public
employees
in
the
hawkeye
state
could
negotiate
only
over
wages
not
for
health
care
or
other
benefits
another
major
union
priority
included
in
the
plan
and
that
would
require
congressional
approval
is
sectoral
bargaining
which
allows
unions
across
a
single
industry
to
bargain
together
and
set
universal
standards
for
wages
and
benefits
