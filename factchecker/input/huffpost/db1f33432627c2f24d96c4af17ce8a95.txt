r-ky
reiterated
tuesday
his
position
on
bringing
gun
control
legislation
to
the
floor
of
the
upper
chamber
saying
he
will
only
do
so
if
it
has
the
backing
of
president
donald
trump
who
would
need
to
sign
it
before
becoming
law
the
kentucky
republican
was
asked
about
the
matter
during
an
interview
with
conservative
radio
host
hugh
hewitt
following
the
latest
mass
shooting
in
odessa
texas
where
a
gunman
killed
at
least
seven
people
and
injured
others
in
a
drive-by
rampage
that
incident
came
less
than
a
month
after
the
deadly
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
in
dayton
ohio
i
said
several
weeks
ago
that
if
the
president
took
a
position
on
a
bill
so
that
we
knew
we
would
actually
be
making
a
law
and
not
just
having
serial
votes
i'd
be
happy
to
put
it
on
the
floor
mcconnell
told
hewitt
in
the
interview
mcconnell
said
the
trump
administration
is
in
the
process
of
studying
what
they
are
prepared
to
support
if
anything
on
the
topic
of
gun
control
and
that
he
expected
to
know
the
answer
next
week
after
the
senate
returns
from
recess
if
the
president
is
in
favor
of
a
number
of
things
that
he
has
discussed
openly
and
publicly
and
i
know
that
if
we
pass
it
it'll
become
law
i'll
put
it
on
the
floor
he
added
the
house
passed
a
bill
earlier
this
year
that
would
require
universal
background
checks
for
all
gun
purchases
it
faces
stiff
opposition
in
the
gop-controlled
senate
however
sen
chris
murphy
d-conn
a
vocal
gun
control
advocate
has
been
in
conversations
with
the
white
house
about
a
potential
deal
on
expanding
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
he
told
reporters
last
month
that
he's
holding
out
hope
for
trump
to
follow
through
on
taking
action
on
guns
despite
his
habit
of
making
promises
and
then
backtracking
after
facing
resistance
from
his
base
some
senate
republicans
also
see
a
path
forward
on
gun
control
legislation
i
have
spoken
with
the
president
repeatedly
and
recently
about
this
topic
he
is
very
interested
in
doing
something
meaningful
sen
pat
toomey
r-pa
said
sunday
on
abc's
this
week
adding
that
his
staff
and
the
white
house
are
very
seriously
pursuing
this
toomey
co-sponsored
a
bipartisan
background
checks
bill
with
sen
joe
manchin
d-w
va
that
legislation
failed
to
overcome
a
gop-led
filibuster
in
trump's
position
on
background
checks
and
other
measures
seeking
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
potentially
dangerous
people
has
varied
widely
in
the
last
month
though
it's
also
unclear
whether
he
can
stick
to
an
endorsement
of
any
potential
deal
on
gun
control
after
hearing
from
conservative
news
outlets
and
the
national
rifle
association
the
nation's
top
gun
lobby
