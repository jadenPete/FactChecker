noaa
warned
staffers
not
to
contradict
trump
on
hurricane
dorian
report
employees
were
given
guidance
on
how
to
handle
the
president's
flubbed
alabama
warning
according
to
the
washington
post
a
top
official
with
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
warned
staffers
last
week
not
to
contradict
president
donald
trump's
false
claims
about
hurricane
dorian's
path
according
to
the
washington
post
the
email
obtained
by
the
post
was
sent
last
sunday
just
hours
after
trump
tweeted
that
alabama
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
by
hurricane
dorian
even
though
projections
at
that
time
showed
no
such
thing
the
official
told
staffers
who
are
tasked
with
accurately
providing
information
during
life-or-death
situations
to
only
stick
with
official
national
hurricane
center
forecasts
if
questions
arise
from
some
national
level
social
media
posts
which
hit
the
news
this
afternoon
a
staffer
who
spoke
to
the
post
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
it
was
clear
to
employees
that
social
media
posts
referred
to
a
tweet
from
the
national
weather
service
station
in
birmingham
alabama
which
contradicted
trump
this
is
the
first
time
i've
felt
pressure
from
above
to
not
say
what
truly
is
the
forecast
the
noaa
meteorologist
told
the
post
it's
hard
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around
one
of
the
things
we
train
on
is
to
dispel
inaccurate
rumors
and
ultimately
that
is
what
was
occurring
ultimately
what
the
alabama
office
did
is
provide
a
forecast
with
their
tweet
that
is
what
they
get
paid
to
do
noaa
was
already
under
fire
for
appearing
to
side
with
trump
over
its
own
scientists
the
agency
sent
out
a
statement
on
friday
in
which
it
criticized
the
birmingham
office
for
its
tweet
a
noaa
official
also
speaking
anonymously
told
the
post
there
was
no
political
motivation
behind
that
statement
and
said
the
tweet
from
the
nws
was
singled
out
because
an
earlier
noaa
hurricane
forecast
did
show
a
to
chance
of
tropical
storm-force
winds
in
one
small
part
of
alabama
but
that
explanation
glosses
over
some
key
inaccuracies
such
wind
speeds
very
rarely
cause
the
damage
trump
suggested
in
his
tweet
and
alabama
was
not
in
the
national
hurricane
center's
cone
of
uncertainty
when
trump
tweeted
several
former
top
officials
with
noaa
also
spoke
out
against
their
former
employer's
actions
saying
they
were
potentially
putting
lives
at
risk
this
is
the
latest
detail
to
emerge
in
a
controversy
in
which
trump
has
continually
refused
to
admit
any
error
the
president
has
spent
days
trying
to
prove
he
was
right
about
alabama
going
as
far
as
to
show
apparently
altered
maps
to
the
press
and
reportedly
reaching
out
to
fox
news
to
back
him
