dim-witted
trump
slammed
over
backward
light
bulb
rule
the
trump
administration
is
rolling
back
energy-efficiency
standards
that
would've
applied
to
about
half
of
the
lightbulbs
used
in
the
u.s.
the
trump
administration
is
rolling
back
of
requirements
for
more
energy-efficient
lightbulbs
a
move
lambasted
by
critics
as
being
both
costly
to
consumers
and
harmful
to
the
planet
the
energy
department
announced
wednesday
that
it
was
eliminating
efficiency
standards
for
many
commonly
used
lightbulbs
these
standards
had
been
included
in
energy
laws
implemented
under
president
george
w.
bush
and
finalized
during
president
barack
obama's
tenure
nbc
news
reported
in
the
years
since
the
bulb
rules
have
become
a
cause
for
conservative
media
and
politicians
including
president
donald
trump
scheduled
to
take
effect
on
jan
the
regulations
would
have
raised
the
energy
efficiency
requirements
for
many
popular
lightbulb
types
including
those
used
in
bathroom
vanities
chandeliers
and
recessed
lighting
the
standards
would
have
led
to
the
phasing
out
of
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
used
for
these
purposes
and
replaced
them
with
fluorescent
or
led
versions
led
bulbs
use
up
to
less
electricity
and
last
considerably
longer
than
traditional
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
the
rule
would
have
applied
to
about
half
of
the
approximately
billion
lightbulbs
used
in
the
u.s.
the
natural
resources
defense
council
said
consumers
were
predicted
to
save
billions
of
dollars
thanks
to
the
new
rule
and
millions
of
tons
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
also
have
been
prevented
experts
said
defending
the
rule
reversal
on
wednesday
the
energy
department
said
the
standards
had
been
established
in
a
manner
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
best
reading
of
existing
law
plus
the
department
said
it
was
returning
choice
to
consumers
with
the
rollback
different
households
have
different
needs
and
it
was
both
unfair
and
illegal
to
limit
their
options
a
department
spokesperson
told
cnbc
while
industry
groups
like
the
national
electrical
manufacturers
association
have
lauded
the
rollback
environmentalists
and
climate
experts
warned
of
its
potentially
damaging
ramifications
the
energy
department
flat
out
got
it
wrong
today
jason
hartke
of
the
alliance
to
save
energy
a
coalition
of
business
and
green
groups
said
in
a
statement
instead
of
moving
us
forward
this
rule
will
keep
more
energy-wasting
bulbs
on
store
shelves
and
saddle
the
average
american
household
with
about
in
unnecessary
energy
costs
every
year
wasting
energy
with
inefficient
lightbulbs
isn't
just
costly
for
homes
and
businesses
it's
terrible
for
our
climate
hartke
added
the
natural
resources
defense
council
vowed
to
explore
all
options
including
litigation
to
stop
the
trump
administration's
misguided
move
today's
action
sets
the
united
states
up
to
become
the
world's
dumping
ground
for
the
inefficient
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
being
phased
out
around
the
world
noah
horowitz
of
the
nrdc's
center
for
energy
efficiency
standards
told
nbc
given
the
worsening
climate
crisis
this
is
no
time
to
significantly
increase
pollution
and
consumer
energy
bills
just
so
a
few
lighting
companies
can
make
more
money
selling
inefficient
bulbs
as
the
hill
noted
environmental
groups
may
not
be
the
only
ones
that'll
take
the
trump
administration
to
court
over
the
reversal
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
d
lambasted
the
rollback
as
a
dim-witted
move
and
said
he
was
prepared
to
launch
a
challenge
over
it
with
all
that's
at
stake
in
the
world
the
trump
administration
has
chosen
to
declare
war
on
energy-efficient
light
bulbs
becerra
said
in
a
statement
this
is
but
another
dim-witted
move
that
will
waste
energy
at
the
expense
of
our
people
and
planet
we
are
prepared
to
challenge
this
latest
trump
backsliding
which
seemingly
has
no
bottom
the
trump
administration
has
tried
to
dismantle
or
weaken
many
regulations
aimed
at
tackling
climate
change
including
relaxing
methane
emissions
standards
and
gutting
the
clean
air
act
