sanders
comments
were
in
response
to
trump's
remarks
to
reporters
earlier
tuesday
in
the
oval
office
he
said
jewish
americans
who
vote
for
democrats
show
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
trump
made
the
remark
to
reporters
when
speaking
about
israel
barring
reps
ilhan
omar
d-minn
and
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
from
entering
the
country
while
he
did
not
specifically
say
who
democratic
jewish
americans
would
be
disloyal
to
he
has
previously
called
the
muslim
congresswomen
anti-israel
and
anti-semites
and
equated
israel
with
all
jewish
people
nearly
of
jewish
voters
in
the
u.s.
voted
democratic
in
the
midterm
elections
according
to
the
pew
research
center
many
jewish
groups
including
the
jewish
democratic
council
of
america
said
trump
was
invoking
the
dual
loyalty
trope
against
jewish
americans
that
is
considered
anti-semitic
trump
repeating
anti-semitic
tropes
emboldening
hate
groups
using
anti-semitism
for
political
purposes
make
us
less
secure
today's
remarks
are
another
example
of
him
weaponizing
politicizing
anti-semitism
for
perceived
political
gain
it
won't
work

august
sanders
often
references
his
family's
experience
in
the
holocaust
his
father
migrated
to
the
u.s.
as
a
teenager
fleeing
persecution
in
poland
sanders
has
also
made
it
a
point
to
balance
talking
about
his
jewish
heritage
with
his
criticism
of
the
israeli
government
and
its
treatment
of
palestinian
people
the
senator
has
continuously
vocalized
support
for
omar
and
tlaib
who
are
attacked
daily
for
their
criticism
of
israel's
government
and
their
support
for
the
pro-palestinian
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
bds
movement
after
israel
announced
its
decision
to
bar
the
congresswomen
omar
stressed
the
need
for
more
oversight
of
the
billions
of
dollars
the
u.s.
gives
in
aid
to
israel
every
year
sanders
agreed
with
omar
saying
that
israel
should
decline
u.s.
aid
if
it's
going
to
prevent
a
congresswoman
from
entering
the
country
if
israel
doesn't
want
members
of
the
united
states
congress
to
visit
their
country
to
get
a
firsthand
look
at
what's
going
on
and
i
have
been
there
many
many
times
but
if
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
doesn't
want
members
to
visit
maybe
he
can
respectfully
decline
the
billions
of
dollars
that
we
give
to
israel
he
said
on
msnbc's
all
in
last
week
related
coverage
trump
accuses
jewish
americans
who
vote
democrat
of
disloyalty

she's
