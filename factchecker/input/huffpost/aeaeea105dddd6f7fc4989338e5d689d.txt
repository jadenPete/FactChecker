usda
reduces
buyouts
for
workers
who
won't
relocate
the
agency
said
it
needed
to
cut
the
payments
so
everyone
can
get
one
so
many
researchers
at
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
have
refused
to
leave
washington
that
the
agency
now
says
it
can't
afford
the
full
buyouts
it
had
offered
them
the
usda
ordered
hundreds
of
workers
to
relocate
to
the
kansas
city
area
about
a
thousand
miles
from
washington
those
who
didn't
want
to
go
could
leave
their
jobs
with
an
incentive
payment
worth
up
to
now
the
usda
is
telling
workers
the
maximum
buyout
will
be
only
a
spokesperson
for
the
agency
said
it
wanted
to
do
right
by
its
employees
and
offer
standard
buyouts
to
every
eligible
employee
who
applied
instead
of
on
a
first
come
first
serve
basis
vice
news
first
reported
on
the
reduced
buyouts
the
american
federation
of
government
employees
union
represents
some
of
the
workers
who
organized
earlier
this
year
to
try
to
protect
themselves
from
the
trump
administration's
capricious
moves
it's
hard
to
imagine
usda
management
finding
more
ways
to
demoralize
the
workers
at
these
two
agencies
yet
they
continue
to
top
themselves
at
every
turn
afge
president
david
cox
said
last
year
the
usda
announced
plans
to
move
two
research
bureaus
and
several
hundred
workers
to
kansas
city
ostensibly
to
move
agriculture
experts
closer
to
farmland
workers
suspected
the
real
reason
was
that
the
trump
administration
wanted
to
make
people
quit
since
it
can
be
difficult
to
fire
federal
workers
mick
mulvaney
the
trump
administration's
budget
chief
appeared
to
confirm
those
suspicions
during
a
speech
earlier
this
month
when
he
hailed
the
usda's
plans
to
move
offices
as
one
of
the
administration's
greatest
accomplishments
guess
what
happened
more
than
half
the
people
quit
he
said
what
a
wonderful
way
to
sort
of
streamline
government
and
do
what
we
haven't
been
able
to
do
for
a
long
time
mulvaney
said
the
usda's
relocation
scheme
targeted
its
national
institute
of
food
and
agriculture
and
the
economic
research
service
the
ers
happens
to
produce
research
that
can
be
unflattering
to
the
trump
agenda
a
recent
ers
report
for
instance
said
the
supplemental
nutrition
assistance
program
boosts
economic
growth
another
credited
snap
benefits
for
boosting
employment
after
the
great
recession
slashing
snap
spending
has
been
a
signature
policy
goal
of
trump's
presidency
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
has
said
he
wants
to
reduce
snap
dependency
arguing
that
people
who
qualify
for
benefits
are
poor
because
food
benefits
have
made
them
loafers
the
usda
had
previously
received
approval
from
the
office
of
personnel
management
for
the
buyouts
which
are
officially
known
as
voluntary
separation
incentive
payments
workers
have
to
have
been
employed
for
three
years
to
be
eligible
and
is
the
maximum
value
the
usda
spokesperson
said
the
agency
doesn't
have
to
offer
buyouts
at
all
and
that
anyone
who
signed
up
expecting
the
full
amount
could
back
out
of
their
decision
the
only
catch
is
they
would
have
to
report
to
work
in
kansas
city
next
month
workers
have
until
p
m
on
monday
to
make
up
their
minds
employees
now
have
less
than
a
week
to
decide
whether
to
accept
the
reduced
buyout
which
also
bars
them
for
working
at
another
federal
agency
for
five
years
cox
said
many
of
these
employees
have
spent
their
careers
devoted
to
agricultural
research
and
furthering
their
agencies
missions
and
they
deserve
to
be
treated
better
than
this
rep
jennifer
wexton
d-va
whose
district
includes
a
lot
of
federal
workers
blasted
the
severance
reduction
in
a
statement
saying
it
was
part
of
a
pattern
of
alarming
disrespect
and
outright
hostility
toward
federal
workers
this
story
has
been
updated
to
include
comment
from
wexton
and
to
remove
a
description
of
the
buyout
as
early
retirement
since
early
retirement
is
a
separate
option
that
has
been
given
to
some
long-tenured
usda
workers
