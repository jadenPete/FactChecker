elizabeth
warren
nails
why
we're
having
arguments
about
straws
and
lightbulbs
the
senator
and
presidential
candidate
said
debates
about
plastic
straws
and
cheeseburgers
were
exactly
what
the
fossil
fuel
industry
wanted
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
urged
americans
not
to
get
distracted
by
climate
arguments
over
plastic
straws
and
lightbulbs
saying
wednesday
that
just
one
group
benefits
from
such
outrage
campaigns
the
fossil
fuel
industry
oh
come
on
give
me
a
break
warren
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
said
during
cnn's
town
hall
forum
on
climate
change
look
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
that
we
try
to
change
our
energy
consumption
and
our
pollution
and
god
bless
all
of
those
ways
some
of
it
is
with
lightbulbs
some
of
it
is
on
straws
some
of
it
dang
is
on
cheeseburgers
but
understand
she
continued
this
is
exactly
what
the
fossil
fuel
industry
hopes
we're
all
talking
about
the
question
came
after
the
trump
administration
announced
wednesday
that
it
would
weaken
federal
rules
that
mandate
americans
use
more
energy-efficient
lightbulbs
cnn's
chris
cuomo
asked
if
the
federal
government
should
be
responsible
for
setting
such
standards
and
though
warren
agreed
lightbulbs
were
an
important
part
of
any
climate
adaptation
strategy
she
noted
that
the
move
was
simply
sleight-of-hand
by
factions
opposed
to
a
shift
to
renewable
energy
that's
what
they
want
us
to
talk
about
warren
said
before
noting
that
in
her
estimation
the
fossil
fuel
industry
wanted
to
cast
the
climate
fight
as
your
problem
she
continued
they
want
to
be
able
to
stir
up
a
lot
of
controversy
around
your
lightbulbs
around
your
straws
and
around
your
cheeseburgers
when
of
the
pollution
of
the
carbon
that
we're
throwing
into
the
air
comes
from
three
industries
the
industries
warren
mentioned
are
the
oil
industry
the
electric
power
industry
and
the
building
industry
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
change
in
lightbulb
efficiency
standards
is
the
latest
move
by
president
donald
trump
to
roll
back
a
slate
of
sweeping
federal
rules
meant
to
rein
in
carbon
emissions
and
tackle
climate
change
last
week
the
white
house
said
it
would
cut
back
regulations
that
limit
methane
emissions
plastic
straws
have
also
become
a
flashpoint
for
some
environmentalists
in
recent
months
and
a
few
conservative
lawmakers
have
lambasted
proposals
like
the
green
new
deal
saying
it
would
make
american
favorites
like
cheeseburgers
a
thing
of
the
past
but
warren
has
long
advocated
going
after
the
fossil
fuel
industry
for
its
role
in
the
climate
crisis
while
seeking
a
swift
transition
toward
renewable
energy
and
net-zero
emissions
from
new
vehicles
electricity
generation
and
buildings
on
wednesday
the
senator
repeated
her
pledges
to
help
american
workers
employed
in
the
fossil
fuel
industry
to
transition
to
high-paying
unionized
jobs
in
the
new
green
economy
let
me
say
one
more
thing
about
workers
because
i
don't
want
to
miss
this
chance
warren
said
understand
we
need
our
smart
workers
we
need
the
guys
and
the
gals
who
have
been
sitting
around
for
a
long
time
who
know
how
to
read
plans
and
they
know
how
to
move
big
equipment
and
they
know
how
to
help
us
because
we're
going
to
need
to
rebuild
our
infrastructure
around
this
country
warren's
response
was
hailed
by
climate
scientists
and
activists
watching
the
town
hall
which
featured
leading
democratic
presidential
candidates
