will
face

christians
realize
its
hypocrisy

democratic
presidential
candidate
pete
buttigieg
predicted
a
coming
reckoning
for
republican
leaders
who
promote
policies
he
believes
contradict
core
christian
values
during
an
appearance
on
msnbc's
morning
joe
on
thursday
the
south
bend
indiana
mayor
said
that
for
a
party
that
claims
to
defend
religious
values
the
gop's
policies
appear
to
contradict
major
religions
teachings
about
caring
for
others
for
the
party
and
the
movement
known
for
beating
other
people
on
the
head
with
their
faith
or
their
interpretation
of
their
faith
it
makes
no
sense
to
literally
vote
to
take
food
away
from
the
hungry
to
essentially
be
practicing
the
very
thing
that
not
just
the
christian
scriptural
tradition
but
so
many
others
tell
us
we're
not
supposed
to
do
in
terms
of
harming
other
people
buttigieg
said
the
mayor
an
episcopalian
who
has
made
faith
a
key
part
of
his
campaign
for
the
democratic
nomination
was
responding
to
questions
about
his
beliefs
posed
by
one
of
the
show's
hosts
joe
scarborough
the
host
pointed
out
that
jesus's
teachings
which
often
appear
in
red
lettering
in
bibles
suggest
christians
will
be
held
accountable
for
how
they
care
for
those
in
need
and
how
they
treat
foreigners
how
do
we
have
the
policies
that
we
have
not
only
at
the
border
but
across
this
country
and
across
this
world
by
people
who
claim
to
believe
the
red
letters
in
the
new
testament
scarborough
asked
buttigieg
responded
that
this
was
a
mystery
to
him
i
do
think
there's
going
to
be
a
reckoning
he
said
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
sitting
in
the
pews
hearing
political
conservatism
all
around
them
wondering
whether
that
really
matches
what
we're
being
told
to
do
buttigieg
on
the
campaign
trail
cites
progressive
christian
leaders
such
as
civil
rights
activist
the
rev
william
barber
as
his
spiritual
role
models
the
ease
with
which
buttigieg
speaks
about
religion
has
caused
some
consternation
among
evangelical
christians
including
accusations
from
some
leaders
that
his
progressive
faith
isn't
an
authentic
expression
of
christianity
earlier
in
the
conversation
scarborough
who
has
identified
as
baptist
in
the
past
asked
buttigieg
if
he
has
accepted
jesus
as
his
lord
and
personal
savior
using
language
about
repentance
and
salvation
that
is
common
among
evangelicals
buttigieg
replied
that
while
he
does
believe
in
jesus
he
hasn't
had
a
road
to
damascus
encounter
referring
to
a
bible
story
about
one
early
apostle's
sudden
and
complete
conversion
experience
he
said
he
came
to
faith
through
an
appreciation
of
mystery
and
through
understanding
that
there
are
limits
to
what
he
can
comprehend
he
added
that
he
still
struggles
with
a
lot
of
doubt
and
ambiguity
buttigieg
said
he
understands
salvation
by
looking
at
the
sacrificial
love
shown
by
jesus
i
don't
know
how
well
that
aligns
with
how
others
view
their
encounter
with
christian
faith
but
i
know
that
in
my
life
it
has
certain
implications
he
said
and
i
also
know
that
it
has
certain
moral
implications
that
i
think
i
can
be
responsible
to
without
saying
that
anybody
else
has
to
believe
what
i
believe
or
has
to
believe
anything
buttigieg
in
the
past
has
specifically
questioned
the
faith
of
president
donald
trump
and
vice
president
mike
pence
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
can
be
as
worshipful
of
your
own
self
as
he
is
and
be
prepared
to
humble
yourself
before
god
buttigieg
said
of
trump
in
an
april
interview
i've
never
seen
him
humble
himself
before
anyone
in
march
he
questioned
how
pence
who
says
he
is
an
evangelical
catholic
has
allowed
himself
to
become
a
cheerleader
of
the
porn-star
presidency
