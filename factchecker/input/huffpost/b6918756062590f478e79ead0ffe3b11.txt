court
approves
banning
atheists
from
reciting
opening
prayers
at
state
legislature
atheists
humanists
and
other
nontheists
can
be
barred
from
giving
opening
invocations
before
the
pennsylvania
house
an
appeals
court
has
decided
a
federal
appeals
court
ruling
on
legislative
prayer
has
alarmed
secular
activists
who
say
the
decision
privileges
people
who
believe
in
god
and
treats
nontheists
like
second-class
citizens
the
rd
u.s.
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
friday
that
it's
constitutional
for
the
pennsylvania
house
of
representatives
to
ban
guest
chaplains
who
don't
believe
in
god
or
a
higher
power
from
delivering
opening
invocations
at
its
meetings
a
group
of
atheists
agnostics
freethinkers
and
humanists
sued
members
of
the
pennsylvania
house
in
over
its
theists-only
policy
for
guest
chaplains
arguing
that
it
violates
the
constitution's
establishment
clause
which
prohibits
the
government
from
promoting
specific
religious
beliefs
judge
thomas
l.
ambro
who
wrote
friday's
majority
opinion
claimed
that
because
prayer
presupposes
a
higher
power
only
theistic
invocations
can
achieve
all
the
purposes
of
legislative
prayer
as
a
matter
of
traditional
practice
a
petition
to
human
wisdom
and
the
power
of
science
does
not
capture
the
full
sense
of
prayer
historically
understood
ambro
wrote
because
nontheists
do
not
proclaim
the
existence
of
a
higher
power
they
cannot
offer
religious
prayer
in
the
historical
sense
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state
an
advocacy
group
that
argued
the
case
for
the
plaintiffs
called
friday's
ruling
discriminatory
and
disturbing
the
majority
opinion
shows
a
preference
for
people
who
believe
in
god
while
sending
a
message
of
exclusion
and
even
scorn
to
non-theists
said
rob
boston
a
senior
adviser
for
the
group
it's
yet
another
in
a
problematic
line
of
recent
decisions
that
allow
government
entities
to
endorse
and
promote
religion
just
about
always
christianity
as
long
as
it's
being
done
for
historic
purposes
boston
wrote
in
a
blog
on
monday
pointing
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court's
decision
in
june
that
allowed
a
foot-tall
cross
to
continue
to
stand
on
public
land
in
maryland
between
and
over
of
the
pennsylvania
house's
legislative
sessions
began
with
a
prayer
according
to
the
rd
circuit
majority
opinion
about
of
the
guest
chaplains
who
delivered
prayers
were
christian
a
few
of
the
chaplains
were
jewish
muslim
or
sikh
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
wanted
to
offer
their
own
nontheistic
prayers
touching
on
themes
such
as
equality
unity
hope
tolerance
and
justice
but
because
they
didn't
believe
in
a
higher
power
they
were
turned
away
last
year
a
district
judge
sided
with
the
plaintiffs
and
ruled
that
the
house's
restrictions
were
unconstitutional
after
that
ruling
house
speaker
mike
turzai
started
assigning
the
prayers
to
members
of
the
house
the
appeals
court's
decision
on
friday
reversed
the
lower
court's
decision
judge
l.
felipe
restrepo
who
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
argued
that
the
pennsylvania
house's
policy
violates
the
establishment
clause
by
instituting
a
religious
orthodoxy
and
controlling
the
content
of
legislative
prayer
restrepo
suggested
that
his
colleagues
opinion
that
only
theistic
invocations
fulfill
the
goals
of
legislative
prayer
skirted
a
dangerous
line
this
line
of
reasoning
by
necessity
involves
answering
sensitive
questions
about
what
constitutes
the
divine
and
what
words
must
be
strung
together
for
a
speech
to
constitute
a
prayer
which
in
my
view
are
precisely
the
type
of
questions
that
the
establishment
clause
forbids
the
government
including
courts
from
answering
restrepo
said
americans
united
told
huffpost
it
is
still
reviewing
the
court's
decision
with
its
clients
and
has
not
yet
made
a
decision
about
whether
to
appeal
when
most
americans
think
about
prayer
they
think
of
speaking
to
a
higher
power
according
to
the
sociologist
elaine
howard
ecklund
director
of
the
religion
and
public
life
program
at
rice
university
who
says
the
court's
ruling
falls
in
line
with
that
at
the
same
time
ecklund
suspects
the
government
will
have
to
grapple
with
how
to
accommodate
the
beliefs
of
the
growing
number
of
nonreligious
americans
as
the
number
of
non
religious
continues
to
grow
alongside
those
who
are
members
of
minority
religious
traditions
as
well
as
evangelical
christians
all
of
whom
say
they
pray
we
will
need
to
continue
to
re
configure
what
religious
pluralism
means
with
relationship
to
our
nations
most
public
religious
rituals
ecklund
told
huffpost
in
an
email
according
to
the
pew
research
center
in
u.s.
adults
believe
in
a
higher
power
though
an
increasing
number
of
americans
don't
identify
with
a
specific
religious
tradition
about
of
people
who
identify
as
atheist
agnostic
or
nothing
in
particular
say
they
do
believe
in
a
higher
power
of
some
kind
but
only
of
them
say
they
try
to
speak
or
pray
to
it
greg
epstein
is
a
humanist
chaplain
at
harvard
university
and
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
epstein
said
that
while
he
hasn't
participated
in
legislative
prayer
he
has
often
been
asked
to
recite
invocations
for
large
civic
gatherings
including
at
an
interfaith
inauguration
ceremony
for
boston
mayor
martin
walsh
epstein
said
the
federal
court's
decision
on
friday
flat-out
violates
my
rights
as
an
american
to
be
treated
equally
it's
just
a
terrible
example
of
religious
privilege
certain
groups
of
powerful
people
literally
still
get
to
define
in
this
country
whose
philosophy
of
life
gets
to
qualify
as
moral
as
ethical
as
worthy
of
endorsement
by
our
legislative
bodies
epstein
said
religious
traditions
such
as
legislative
prayer
shouldn't
deprive
secular
and
humanist
activists
of
their
dignity
and
shouldn't
be
used
to
impose
a
bigoted
standard
of
faith
on
everyone
epstein
said
none
of
this
going
to
help
religion
in
any
way
whatsoever
there
is
a
river
gushing
out
of
american
christianity
right
now
and
this
ruling
will
only
increase
its
speed
and
power
he
said
it
probably
already
has
