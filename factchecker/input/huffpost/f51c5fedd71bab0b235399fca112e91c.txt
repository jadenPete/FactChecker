elizabeth
warren
has
a
plan
to
reduce
mass
incarceration
and
violence
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
released
a
list
of
proposals
centered
on
community-driven
initiatives
and
a
reformed
justice
system
minneapolis
sen
elizabeth
warren
just
unveiled
multiple
policies
on
criminal
justice
reform
specifically
aimed
at
reducing
mass
incarceration
while
putting
more
resources
toward
community-driven
initiatives
the
massachusetts
democrat's
plan
released
tuesday
centers
on
how
people
think
of
public
safety
and
the
false
notion
that
mass
incarceration
leads
to
safer
communities
some
of
the
ways
to
reframe
public
safety
according
to
her
plan
involve
creating
accessible
mental
health
services
protecting
lgbtq
people
from
violence
implementing
violence
intervention
programs
for
youth
and
providing
safe
affordable
housing
real
reform
requires
examining
every
step
of
this
system
the
presidential
candidate
said
in
a
medium
post
from
what
we
choose
to
criminalize
to
how
law
enforcement
and
prosecutors
engage
with
communities
and
the
accused
to
how
long
we
keep
people
behind
bars
how
we
treat
them
when
they're
there
and
how
we
reintegrate
them
when
they
return
the
u.s.
makes
up
of
the
world's
population
but
nearly
of
the
world's
prison
population
and
the
evidence
is
clear
that
there
are
structural
race
problems
in
our
criminal
justice
system
at
every
level
the
system
disadvantages
or
discriminates
against
people
of
color
elizabeth
warren
ewarren
august
warren
on
tuesday
touched
upon
portions
of
her
plan
during
a
roundtable
discussion
about
criminal
justice
reform
at
better
futures
minnesota
a
minneapolis-based
nonprofit
that
employs
previously
incarcerated
workers
in
an
effort
to
reduce
recidivism
justice
is
not
free
she
told
the
panel
which
included
state
rep
jamie
long
d
and
hennepin
county
chief
public
defender
mary
moriarty
we
have
to
invest
in
it
to
make
it
work
better
futures
minnesota
president
and
ceo
thomas
adams
said
offering
programs
to
former
inmates
that
enrich
their
lives
as
well
as
their
communities
is
key
to
breaking
the
cycle
of
mass
incarceration
we
have
individuals
who
have
done
their
time
and
we
continue
to
marginalize
them
ostracize
them
and
treat
them
not
only
as
second-class
citizens
but
as
no-class
citizens
adams
said
then
we're
confused
as
to
why
there's
this
revolving
door
of
people
going
back
to
prison
we
want
to
disrupt
that
it's
amazing
what
happens
when
someone
feels
good
about
themselves
he
added
thomas
adams
president
ceo
of

says
formerly
incarcerated
people
are
treated
not
only
as
second-class
citizens
but
as
no-class
citizens

want
to
disrupt

august
among
her
long
list
of
proposals
is
investing
in
violence
reduction
initiatives
that
focus
on
community-centric
restorative
justice
such
as
ceasefire
a
program
modeled
in
boston
oakland
california
and
chicago
that
uses
community
partnerships
and
rehabilitative
methods
to
tackle
gun
violence
reduce
recidivism
improve
police-community
relationships
and
heal
the
community
instead
of
contributing
to
mass
jailings
recently
researchers
found
that
oakland
has
cut
its
annual
homicides
and
nonfatal
shootings
by
nearly
half
since
warren
also
called
for
the
repeal
of
the
crime
bill
which
was
considered
one
of
fellow
democrat
joe
biden's
biggest
achievements
as
a
senator
but
has
since
become
associated
with
the
rise
in
mass
incarceration
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
also
a
presidential
rival
has
also
called
for
repealing
the
crime
bill
in
her
plan
warren
mentioned
that
the
crime
bill's
mandatory
minimums
for
incarcerated
people
are
not
effective
and
must
be
reduced
or
eliminated
asked
tuesday
if
her
call
to
roll
back
the
crime
bill
was
a
direct
criticism
of
biden
warren
danced
around
the
question
it's
a
direct
criticism
of
a
bill
that
has
been
very
harmful
to
millions
of
people
and
has
been
particularly
harmful
to
communities
of
color
she
told
reporters
we
need
to
correct
that
mistake
in
addition
warren
called
for
initiatives
to
support
incarcerated
people's
reentry
into
their
communities
some
of
those
initiatives
include
creating
a
federal
expungement
option
which
mimics
what
many
states
do
at
their
government
level
and
reversing
federal
guidance
that
exempts
private
reentry
programs
that
contract
with
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
from
anti-discrimination
laws
tonja
honsey
executive
director
of
the
minnesota
freedom
fund
a
nonprofit
that
pays
bonds
for
low-income
individuals
who
cannot
afford
to
said
developing
initiatives
to
address
the
trauma
people
experience
during
and
after
incarceration
is
essential
it's
continued
trauma
even
after
you
leave
prison
said
honsey
who
spent
roughly
two
decades
of
her
life
in
and
out
of
incarceration
and
now
works
to
keep
others
from
falling
into
the
same
cycle
how
do
we
start
to
talk
about
that
and
recognize
what
they've
been
through
real
reform
requires
examining
every
step
of
this
system
sen
elizabeth
warren
warren
acknowledged
in
her
proposal
that
the
federal
government
oversees
just
of
the
country's
incarcerated
people
making
it
difficult
for
a
president
to
ensure
reform
at
local
levels
warren
said
her
administration
would
incentivize
adoption
of
new
federal
standards
through
the
grantmaking
process
for
local
and
state
governments
pointing
out
that
federal
grants
comprise
almost
a
third
of
state
budgets
and
that
about
of
state
budgets
is
dedicated
to
law
enforcement
we
cannot
achieve
this
by
nibbling
around
the
edges
we
need
to
tackle
the
problem
at
its
roots
warren
said
in
her
medium
post
that
means
implementing
a
set
of
bold
structural
changes
at
all
levels
of
government
these
policies
are
not
warren's
first
plans
aimed
at
reforming
the
criminal
justice
system
the
presidential
candidate
has
already
proposed
banning
private
prisons
ending
cash
bail
and
legalizing
marijuana
her
campaign's
record
also
includes
supporting
the
black
lives
matter
movement
and
the
demilitarization
of
law
enforcement
to
combat
police
brutality
something
she
has
in
common
with
rival
candidate
sen
bernie
sanders
vt
the
new
proposals
add
to
warren's
list
of
policies
that
address
racial
inequity
the
senator
has
already
released
plans
that
aim
to
address
the
racial
wage
gap
wealth
gap
maternal
mortality
gap
and
startup
capital
gap
she's
said
before
that
the
root
of
the
problem
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
race
and
reaffirmed
that
in
her
tuesday
plan
saying
race
permeates
every
aspect
of
the
system
warren's
plan
to
reduce
mass
incarceration
joins
criminal
justice
reform
plans
of
her
fellow
presidential
contenders
