donald
trump
tweeted
tuesday
that
he's
canceling
a
meeting
with
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
after
finding
out
she
thinks
his
proposal
to
buy
greenland
is
absurd
trump
was
previously
scheduled
to
visit
denmark
which
maintains
greenland
as
an
autonomous
territory
in
two
weeks
but
since
frederiksen
has
no
interest
in
discussing
the
purchase
of
greenland
he
wrote
he's
postponing
his
meeting
with
her
denmark
is
a
very
special
country
with
incredible
people
but
based
on
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen's
comments
that
she
would
have
no
interest
in
discussing
the
purchase
of
greenland
i
will
be
postponing
our
meeting
scheduled
in
two
weeks
for
another
time

trump
didn't
initially
express
any
ill
will
toward
frederiksen
and
thanked
her
for
being
so
direct
the
prime
minister
was
able
to
save
a
great
deal
of
expense
and
effort
for
both
the
united
states
and
denmark
by
being
so
direct
i
thank
her
for
that
and
look
forward
to
rescheduling
sometime
in
the
future

during

gaggle
before

on
wednesday
trump
continued
to
lambastefrederiksen
denmark
i
looked
forward
to
going
but
i
thought
that
the
prime
minister's
statement
that
it
was
absurd
was
nasty
he
said
all
she
had
to
say
was
no
trump
i
look
forward
to
going
to
going
to
denmark
but
i
thought
the
prime
minister's
statement
that
buying
greenland
was
an
absurd
idea
was
nasty
i
thought
it
was
an
inappropriate
statement

august
frederiksen
said
at
a
news
conference
wednesday
morning
that
she
was
disappointed
and
surprised
by
trump's
decision
to
cancel
adding
that
the
invitation
for
a
stronger
strategic
cooperation
with
the
americans
in
the
arctic
is
still
open
according
to
the
associated
press
the
united
states
is
one
of
our
closest
allies
she
said
trump
confirmed
sunday
that
he
was
seriously
weighing
whether
the
u.s.
could
buy
greenland
an
ice-covered
island
situated
between
the
arctic
and
north
atlantic
oceans
the
wall
street
journal
reported
last
week
that
he'd
been
discussing
the
idea
with
white
house
counsel
the
news
was
baffling
to
many
u.s.
and
world
leaders
and
especially
to
those
in
denmark
greenland
is
not
for
sale
frederiksen
told
the
danish
newspaper
sermitsiaq
on
sunday
greenland
is
not
danish
greenland
belongs
to
greenland
i
strongly
hope
that
this
is
not
meant
seriously
