trump
basically
admits
trade
wars
are
not
so
good
or
easy
to
win
the
president
defended
his
escalating
trade
dispute
with
china
whether
it's
good
for
our
country
or
bad
for
our
country
short
term
president
donald
trump
on
tuesday
acknowledged
that
trade
wars
may
not
be
so
good
or
easy
to
win
as
he
claimed
last
year
when
he
announced
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
imports
when
a
country
usa
is
losing
many
billions
of
dollars
on
trade
with
virtually
every
country
it
does
business
with
trade
wars
are
good
and
easy
to

we
are
down

a
certain
country
and
they
get
cute

trade
anymore-we
win
big
it's
easy

march
in
remarks
at
the
white
house
following
a
meeting
with
the
president
of
romania
trump
dismissed
what
he
called
the
short-term
negative
economic
effects
of
his
trade
war
with
china
and
argued
that
rising
tariffs
are
needed
to
give
the
u.s.
more
leverage
in
ongoing
trade
talks
china
has
been
ripping
this
country
off
for
years
for
longer
than
that
and
it's
about
time
whether
it's
good
for
our
country
or
bad
for
our
country
short
term
trump
said
citing
the
trade
deficit
and
costly
intellectual
property
theft
by
chinese
companies
but
the
bad
economic
news
is
piling
up
for
the
president
the
financial
markets
signaled
the
possibility
of
a
recession
last
week
due
to
growing
investor
concerns
about
the
trade
war
which
has
battered
u.s.
farmers
and
manufacturers
the
nonpartisan
congressional
budget
office
reported
this
week
that
trump's
trade
policies
are
doing
more
harm
to
the
economy
than
it
projected
in
january
it
now
expects
those
policies
to
reduce
the
real
gross
domestic
product
by
by
or
per
household
on
average
on
tuesday
trump
seemed
to
acknowledge
the
turmoil
on
wall
street
even
as
he
argued
the
u.s.
has
no
choice
but
to
impose
tariffs
on
goods
made
in
china
my
trade
deals
aren't
causing
a
problem
this
is
something
that
had
to
be
done
he
said
i
could
be
sitting
here
right
now
with
a
stock
market
that
would
be
up
points
higher
if
i
didn't
want
to
do
it
in
another
tacit
admission
trump
said
his
administration
may
offer
some
form
of
aid
to
u.s.
companies
like
apple
that
are
struggling
as
a
result
of
the
trade
war
if
i
didn't
help
them
they
would
i
mean
they
would
be
they
would
have
a
big
problem
he
added
without
offering
details
about
the
form
of
assistance
trump's
remarks
come
in
the
wake
of
his
decision
earlier
this
month
to
delay
another
round
of
tariffs
on
goods
from
china
from
sept
to
dec
an
apparent
effort
to
boost
the
critical
consumer
spending
sector
during
the
holiday
shopping
season
his
administration
is
also
considering
other
ways
to
encourage
consumer
spending
and
economic
growth
like
a
temporary
cut
in
payroll
taxes
and
further
interest
rate
cuts
by
the
federal
reserve
all
these
developments
reveal
the
growing
concern
about
the
economy
among
trump
and
his
top
aides
despite
the
president's
claims
otherwise
and
his
efforts
to
shift
blame
for
any
bad
economic
news
on
wednesday
for
example
trump
accused
the
media
of
somehow
attempting
to
manufacture
a
recession
our
economy
is
sooo
strong
sorry
he
tweeted
the
fake
news
lamestream
media
is
doing
everything
possible
the
create
a
u.s.
recession
even
though
the
numbers
facts
are
working
totally
in
the
opposite
direction
they
would
be
willing
to
hurt
many
people
but
that
doesn't
matter
to
them
our
economy
is
sooo
strong
sorry
