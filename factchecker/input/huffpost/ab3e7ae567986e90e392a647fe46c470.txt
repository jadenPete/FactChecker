unqualified
and
ideological
a
guide
to
trump's
worst
judges
if
you
care
about
women's
rights
lgbtq
rights
or
voting
rights
or
about
judges
being
fit
to
serve
you
oughta
read
this
washington
senate
republicans
are
confirming
so
many
of
president
donald
trump's
nominees
to
lifetime
federal
court
seats
it's
hard
to
keep
up
who
are
these
people
what
difference
will
they
make
in
my
life
anyway
you're
in
luck
we're
going
to
break
it
down
here
two
and
a
half
years
in
what
stands
out
about
trump's
confirmed
judges
isn't
just
the
quantity
which
is
remarkable
two
supreme
court
justices
a
record-breaking
appeals
court
judges
and
district
court
judges
it's
that
a
chunk
of
his
judges
shouldn't
be
on
the
bench
at
all
because
they
aren't
qualified
or
they're
so
ideologically
extreme
that
it's
next
to
impossible
to
imagine
them
as
fair
arbiters
of
justice
these
judges
are
now
on
federal
courts
at
every
level
from
the
supreme
court
to
appeals
courts
which
have
the
final
say
in
nearly
all
federal
cases
down
to
district
courts
where
these
cases
are
first
filed
for
the
appeals
court
judges
in
particular
the
decisions
these
people
make
will
affect
you
and
millions
of
other
people
for
generations
it
is
important
for
the
public
to
appreciate
that
appeals
court
appointees
serve
on
courts
that
are
the
courts
of
last
resort
for
of
cases
in
their
regions
of
the
u.s.
on
issues
like
capital
punishment
abortion
same-sex
marriage
immigration
etc
said
carl
tobias
a
university
of
richmond
law
professor
and
an
expert
on
federal
judicial
nominations
the
key
is
they
resolve
cases
per
year
and
the
supreme
court
resolves
here's
a
snapshot
of
trump's
most
alarming
judges
to
date
incredibly
all
but
one
wendy
vitter
is
or
was
a
member
of
the
federalist
society
a
conservative
lawyers
group
that
has
effectively
been
picking
trump's
judicial
nominees
for
him
there
is
a
clear
theme
to
these
judges
too
they
have
records
of
being
anti-lgbtq
anti-abortion
and
anti-voting
rights
credibly
accused
of
sexual
assault
kavanaugh
repeatedly
lied
under
oath
in
his
senate
confirmation
hearing
and
alternating
between
crying
yelling
and
interrupting
senate
committee
members
as
they
pressed
him
on
credible
sexual
assault
allegations
against
him
he
blamed
his
rocky
confirmation
process
on
politics
kavanaugh's
unhinged
behavior
raised
fresh
questions
about
his
temperament
to
be
a
justice
on
the
nation's
highest
court
as
sen
lisa
murkowski
r-alaska
concluded
in
opposing
him
he
failed
to
meet
the
standard
spelled
out
in
the
code
of
judicial
conduct
rule
which
states
that
a
judge
must
act
at
all
times
in
a
manner
that
promotes
public
confidence
in
the
independence
integrity
and
impartiality
of
the
judiciary
and
shall
avoid
impropriety
and
the
appearance
of
impropriety
the
american
bar
association
was
prepared
to
revisit
its
previous
well
qualified
rating
of
kavanaugh
after
his
disastrous
hearing
but
senate
republicans
went
ahead
and
confirmed
him
so
the
group
let
it
go
every
republican
but
one
murkowski
voted
to
confirm
him
unanimously
rated
not
qualified
by
the
aba
grasz
earned
an
embarrassing
and
unanimous
not
qualified
rating
from
the
aba
which
has
been
evaluating
federal
judicial
nominees
since
and
rarely
gives
such
an
abysmal
rating
former
colleagues
described
grasz
as
gratuitously
rude
per
the
aba
review
and
expressed
an
unusual
fear
of
consequences
if
they
said
anything
bad
about
him
because
of
his
deep
connection
to
powerful
politicians
aba
members
also
raised
concerns
that
grasz
is
unable
to
separate
his
role
as
an
advocate
from
that
of
a
judge
given
his
record
of
opposing
lgbtq
and
abortion
rights
every
senate
republican
present
voted
to
confirm
him
rated
not
qualified
by
the
aba
kobes
earned
a
not
qualified
rating
by
the
aba
because
he
was
unable
to
provide
sufficient
writing
samples
of
the
caliber
required
of
a
circuit
judge
he
also
failed
to
demonstrate
an
especially
high
degree
of
legal
scholarship
and
excellent
analytical
and
writing
experience
per
the
aba
review
kobes
certainly
benefited
from
being
a
former
aide
to
sen
mike
rounds

one

to
confirm
him

a
series
of
inflammatory
articles
on
sexual
assault
race
and
lgbtq

as
a
yale

a
good
way
to
avoid
a
potential

is
to
stay
reasonably
sober
she
wrote
adding
that
if
a
woman
drinks
to
the
point
where
she
cannot
choose
if
she
wants
to
have
sex
getting
to
that
point
was
part
of
her
choice
rao
also
denounced
special
treatment
for
minority
students
and
called
the
fight
for
lgbtq
rights
a
trendy
political
movement
every
senate

is
on

which
trump
said
only
includes
people
willing
to
overturn
roe

the
former
notre
dame
law
professor
also
sparked
questions
about
her
membership
in
a
tightly
knit
christian
group
called
people
of
praise
in
which
members
swear
a
lifelong
oath
of
loyalty
and
are
accountable
to
a
personal

a
handmaid
for
women
and
are
taught
that
husbands
are
the
heads
of
their
wives
and
should
take
authority
over
the
family
every
senate
republican
voted
to
confirm
her
defended
voter
suppression
law
that
targeted
african
americans
with
almost
surgical
precision
as
an
attorney
duncan
defended
north
carolina's
egregious
voter
suppression
law
that
a
federal
appeals
court
struck
down
in
ruling
that
it
discriminated
against
black
voters
and
targeted
african
americans
with
almost
surgical
precision
duncan
appealed
the
case
to
the
supreme

calling
it
ludicrous
to
suggest
the

echoed
jim
crow

the
supreme

rejected
his
appeal
he
also
led
hobby
lobby's
supreme
court
fight
against
covering
birth
control
under
its
employee
health
plans
and
he
claimed
the
court's
decision
in
obergefell
v
hodges
which
legalized
marriage
equality
raises
a
question
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
court

called
claims

irrelevant
pouting

a
series
of
offensive
articles
as
a
student
and
newspaper
editor
at
cornell
university
claims
of
sexism
are
irrelevant
pouting
he
wrote
and
lgbtq
rights
advocacy
is
yet
another
way
to
portray
people
as
victims
in
need
of
preferential
treatment
he
argued
that
gay
people
are
more
promiscuous
than
straight
people
which
is
why
out
of
people
with
aids
are
gay
or
drug
users
that
multiculturalism
is
a
malodorous
sickness
and
that
african
americans
fight
for
equality
post-slavery
is
similar
to
other
immigrants
trying
to
overcome
discrimination
lee
initially
hid
his
writings
from
senators
but
they
were
later
uncovered

stating
that
marriage
equality
is
not
an
issue
for
