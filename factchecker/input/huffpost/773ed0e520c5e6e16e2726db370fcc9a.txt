the
president
of
the
afl-cio
union
federation
told
fox
news
chris
wallace
on
sunday
that
the
trump
administration
has
done
more
things
to
hurt

than
to
help
them
comments
that
elicited
angry
tweets
from
president
donald
trump
richard
trumka
head
of
the
group
that
includes
different
unions
said
wages
are
being
swamped
by
rising
health
care
and
housing
costs
and
that
trump
is
botching
his
trade
war
with
china
trump
has
also
opposed
every
effort
to
increase
the
minimum
wage
and
has
stripped
safety
standards
that
used
to
protect
workers
trumka
said
i've
tried
to
call
balls
and
strikes
with
him
he
said
referring
to
trump
when
he
does
something
that's
good
for
workers
i
say
so
when
he
does
something
that's
bad
for
workers
i
say
so
and
i
have
to
say
unfortunately
while
he
may
not
even
know
what
his
administration
is
doing
they've
done
more
things
to
hurt
workers
than
they
have
to
help
them
trump
on
monday
morning
tweeted
his
displeasure
with
trumka
saying
union
members
should
stop
paying
dues
and
vote
for
him
in
just
watched
afl-cio
president
richard
trumka
on
foxnews
and
thought
to
myself
how
different
he
is
on
tv
than
he
is
when
he
is
with
me
at
the
white
house
likes
what
we
are
doing
until
the
cameras
go
on
we
got
robbed
on
trade
and
everything
else
while
his
dems
just
sat
back
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
september
and
watched
nafta
is
the
worst
trade
deal
ever
made
terrible
for
labor
and
richard
let
it
stand
no
wonder
unions
are
losing
so
much
the
workers
will
vote
for
me
in
lowest
unemployment
most
jobs
ever
and
should
stop
paying
exorbitant
dues
not
worth
it
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
september
in
the
interview
sunday
trumka
said
union
voters
helped
put
trump
in
the
white
house
he
came
to
our
members
and
said
i'm
going
to
change
the
rules
of
the
economy
and
they
believed
him
and
quite
frankly
i
wish
he
would
have
changed
the
rules
of
the
economy
trumka
told
wallace
unfortunately
the
rules
he's
changing
has
hurt
them
he's
opposed
every
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
he's
changed
the
regulation
to
take
overtime
away
from
a
couple
of
million
people
he's
rolled
back
health
and
safety
standards
for
workers
trumka
said
real
wages
are
down
because
they're
increasingly
being
gobbled
up
by
housing
costs
and
health
care
look
our
members
are
still
waiting
for
the
supposed
greatness
of
this
economy
to
reach
their
kitchen
tables
he
said
when
they
do
i'll
cheer
they'll
cheer
and
they'll
all
support
the
person
who
helped
get
it
there
trumka
also
said
the
afl-cio
will
not
support
the
current
u.s.
mexico
canada
agreement
the
president's
version
of
nafta
that
hasn't
yet
been
approved
by
congress
trumka
said
the
trade
regulations
are
unenforceable
and
that
mexican
wages
will
suck
jobs
and
capital
out
of
the
united
states
as
for
china
trumka
said
it
was
good
the
president
had
taken
on
the
country
but
that
he
has
done
it
the
wrong
way
if
you're
going
to
take
on
china
it
has
to
be
multilateral
it
has
to
address
human
rights
and
labor
rights
violations
trumka
said
it
has
to
address
currency
rebalancing
and
it
has
to
have
a
long-term
slant
towards
good
jobs
in
this
country
that's
not
been
the
approach
unfortunately
trumka
made
many
of
the
same
points
that
farm
association
leaders
have
expressed
in
recent
weeks
roger
johnson
the
head
of
the
national
farmers
union
also
said
last
week
that
trump
should
have
taken
on
china
as
part
of
a
team
of
allies
farmers
have
complained
that
the
china
stalemate
and
other
administration
policies
are
hurting
their
livelihoods
