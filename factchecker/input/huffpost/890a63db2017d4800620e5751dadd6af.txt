cory

passionately
defended
his
reliance
on
the
fundraising
prowess
of
two
controversial
garden
state
political
bosses
during
tough
questioning
at
a
presidential
candidate
question-and-answer
session
hosted
by
the
working
families
party
in
las
vegas
on
tuesday
evening
tim
merrill
an
african
american
pastor
in
camden
new
jersey
asked
booker
whether
he
would
give
back
the
reported
that
he
received
at
a
june
fundraiser
hosted
by
insurance
executive
george
norcross

essex

bosses
in

and
north
jersey
respectively
the
booker
campaign
disputes
the
size
of
the
haul
from
the
fundraiser
merrill
prefaced
his
question
with
an
indictment
of
norcross
influence
on
the
state's
tax
incentive
program
which
reportedly
prevented
the
development
of
a
full-service
supermarket
in
camden
an
impoverished
city
with
few
stores
that
sell
affordable
fresh
food
for
the
benefit
of
other
developers
with
ties
to
norcross
norcross
is
engaged
in
a
bitter
battle
with
new
jersey
gov
phil
murphy
a
democrat
elected
in
who
has
sought
to
overhaul
the
state's
tax
incentive
law
setting
up
a
task
force
to
investigate
it
and
vetoing
legislation
that
would
have
renewed
it
in
its
current
form
murphy's
task
force
found
that
billion
out
of
billion
in
tax
incentives
granted
by
the
state
in
camden
went
to
businesses
or
nonprofits
associated
with
norcross
i
don't
agree
with
your
characterization
of
how
much
resources
this
individual
raised
for
my
campaign
booker
responded
without
elaborating
the
booker
campaign
did
not
have
its
own
estimate
of
the
money
raised
by
the
norcross-divincenzo
fundraiser
which
required
guests
to
pledge
the
maximum
amount
an
individual
can
contribute
in
each
stage
of
an
election
cycle
huffpost's
analysis
of
federal
election
filings
found
that
booker
raised
just
over
in
increments
of
or
more
from
donors
in
new
jersey
new
york
and
pennsylvania
on
the
day
of
the
fundraiser
and
the
two
days
afterward
in
his
response
tuesday
evening
booker
went
on
to
discuss
the
ways
he
is
seeking
to
prevent
perceived
conflicts
of
interest
in
his
presidential
campaign
he
does
not
accept
donations
from
corporate
pacs
federal
lobbyists
or
pharmaceutical
company
executives
a
lot
of
the
issues
that
you're
talking
about
i
know
are
playing
out
in
state
politics
but
i'm
going
to
tell
you
the
things
that
i
can
also
do
to
help
camden
succeed
as
president
of
the
united
states
he
continued
he
went
on
to
outline
his
plans
to
ensure
affordable
housing
by
among
other
things
enacting
a
tax
deduction
for
renters
and
to
reform
agriculture
policy
so
that
processed
junk
food
doesn't
end
up
being
cheaper
than
fresh
produce
we're
incentivizing
food
systems
that
empower
communities
to
end
food
deserts
once
and
for
all
in
our
country

maurice

the
executive
director
of

party
and
host
of
the
forum
followed
up
pressing
booker
on
whether
he
at
least
understood
the
calls
to
return
the
money
given
some
of
norcross
and
divincenzo's
activities
and
rhetoric
he
noted
that
norcross
who's
called
himself
a
conservative
democrat
is
a
member
of
president
donald
trump's
mar-a-lago
resort
in
florida
and
that
divincenzo
rents
out
part
of
a
county
jail
to
the
federal
government
to
serve
as
an
immigrant
detention
center
a
visibly
emotional
booker
responded
by
defending
his
alliance
with
divincenzo
in
particular
as
essential
to
effecting
change
for
his
constituents
when
he
was
mayor
of
newark
when
i
needed
help
when
i
was
mayor
our
city
was
in
the
middle
of
a
recession
was
in
economic
free
fall
and
we
were
facing
decisions
no
good
decisions
joe
d.
was
one
of
those
guys
that
was
there
for
me
that
helped
us
get
out
of
binds
he
said
when
i
had
communities
that
needed
parks
you
could
go
around
newark
we
had
the
largest
parks
expansion
in
a
century
in
our
city
during
a
recession
and
it
stabilized
some
communities
i
could
go
through
the
things
from
housing
that
he
was
a
partner
of
mine
in
to
education
our
county
schools
now
and
our
county
college
the
resources
and
the
turnaround
he
added
booker
expressed
his
frustration
at
some
democrats
who
he
argued
would
never
have
taken
on
his
mission
of
moving
to
and
seeking
to
improve
a
city
as
troubled
as
newark
but
were
nonetheless
critical
of
the
way
he
sometimes
built
uneasy
alliances
to
advance
his
constituents
interests
when
the
globe
has
a
recession
inner
cities
have
depression-like
circumstances
and
you
find
partners
who
may
not
align
but
deliver
real
results
for
your
community
that's
what
i'm
always
going
to
do
he
said
i'm
always
going
to
be
on
the
side
of
making
progress
for
folks
he
likened
his
work
with
divincenzo
to
his
collaboration
with
then-republican
gov
chris
christie
whom
he
needed
to
sign
off
on
the
creation
of
new
urban
farms
for
example
i
could
have
held
a
press
conference
every
day
blasting
him
and
it
actually
would
have
helped
my
politics
he
said
but
i
had
to
build
housing
i
had
to
create
jobs
i
had
creative
ideas
booker
conceded
that
he
might
not
actually
agree
with
divincenzo
about
keeping
the
immigration
detention
facility
open
but
he
noted
that
the
essex
county
leader
has
begun
opening
it
up
to
visits
from
activists
scrutiny
on
the
detention
center
has
risen
amid
reports
of
human
rights
abuses
perpetrated
at
the
facility
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
deported
a
ghanaian
immigrant
to
new
york
city
earlier
this
month
despite
the
man's
allegation
that
two
essex
county
corrections
offers
had
assaulted
and
raped
him
during
his
detention
at
the
county
jail
the
working
families
party
has
been
supportive
of
gov
murphy's
effort
to
clean
up
the
state's
tax
incentive
system
and
publicly
called
on
booker
not
to
attend
the
june
fundraiser
hosted
by
norcross
and
divincenzo
on
wednesday
joe
dinkin
a
spokesman
for
the
progressive
group
which
is
interviewing
candidates
as
part
of
its
endorsement
process
said
it
was
up
to
our
members
to
determine
whether
his
answer
was
satisfactory
in
their
pursuit
of
wealth
or
power
george
norcross
and
joe
d.
have
left
real
human
suffering
in
their
wake
dinkin
said
we
continue
to
hope
senator
booker
will
reconsider
his
relationships
with
new
jersey's
political
bosses
the
criticism
of
booker's
ties
to
norcross
and
divincenzo
in
some
ways
reflects
the
inherent
challenges
of
building
a
career
in
new
jersey's
rough-and-tumble
political
environment
where
old-fashioned
patronage
remains
the
dominant
currency
christie
the
last
new
jerseyite
to
run
for
president
saw
his
white
house
hopes
dashed
largely
due
to
a
scandal
in
which
his
aides
caused
a
traffic
jam
by
the
george
washington
bridge
to
punish
a
local
democratic
mayor
who
did
not
endorse
christie's
re-election
bid
booker
has
struggled
to
break
out
of
the
single
digits
in
polls
of
the
early
primary
and
caucus
states
but
he
has
received
donations
from
over
individual
donors
and
exceeded
in
enough
voter
surveys
to
qualify
for
the
september
democratic
debate
this
story
has
been
updated
to
include
that
the
booker
campaign's
disputes
how
much
money
was
raised
at
the
norcross-divincenzo
fundraiser
as
well
as
huffpost's
own
