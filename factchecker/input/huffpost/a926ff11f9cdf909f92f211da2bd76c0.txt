republicans
squirm
as
trump's
wall
takes
money
for
projects
on
their
turf
gop
officials
are
blaming
democrats
after
the
trump
administration
defunded
military
projects
in
their
states
republican
lawmakers
who
supported
president
donald
trump's
emergency
declaration
for
the
u.s.
mexico
border
early
this
year
are
attempting
to
save
face
after
the
administration
announced
it
would
fund
a
wall
on
parts
of
the
southern
boundary
with
money
for
projects
in
their
districts
the
department
of
defense
this
week
listed
more
than
projects
including
training
facilities
parking
lots
schools
and
daycare
centers
on
various
military
installations
that
would
not
go
forward
as
planned
in
the
next
few
years
much
of
the
money
diverted
to
build
trump's
wall
the
one
he
insisted
as
a
candidate
that
mexico
would
pay
for
had
been
earmarked
for
house
districts
and
states
represented
by
gop
lawmakers
who
voted
to
uphold
the
president's
emergency
declaration
some
of
these
same
politicians
now
seek
to
pin
the
blame
for
the
stalled
projects
on
democrats
as
they
pledge
to
reinstall
their
funding
in
budget
talks
later
this
month
the
complainers
include
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
projects
on
the
chopping
block
include
a
million
renovation
of
a
middle
school
at
fort
campbell
whose
th
th
and
th-grade
classes
face
overcrowded
conditions
the
base
straddles
the
border
between
kentucky
and
tennessee
mcconnell
said
friday
he
has
talked
to
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
about
the
protecting
the
fort
campbell
project
and
as
a
trump
ally
he
singled
out
democrats
for
criticism
we
would
not
be
in
this
situation
if
democrats
were
serious
about
protecting
our
homeland
and
worked
with
us
to
provide
the
funding
needed
to
secure
our
borders
during
our
appropriations
process
mcconnell
said
in
a
statement
rep
james
comer
r-ky
whose
district
encompasses
ft
cambell
also
blamed
democrats
the
necessary
funding
to
strengthen
our
border
was
not
provided
during
the
appropriations
process
time
and
again
blocked
by
partisan
politics
comer
said
in
a
statement
in
which
he
vowed
to
ensure
the
school
renovation
project
gets
completed
during
congressional
negotiations
in
january
democrats
supported
new
money
for
border
security
but
not
for
wall
construction
all
told
the
defense
department
listed
nine
school
improvement
projects
affected
by
the
funding
diversion
including
two
in
the
continental
u.s.
one
in
puerto
rico
and
six
abroad
existing
facilities
for
education
remain
and
will
continue
to
be
used
a
senior
defense
official
said
in
an
email
the
fight
over
the
deferred
military
construction
funding
will
likely
take
place
in
the
house-senate
negotiations
over
the
annual
defense
spending
bill
over
the
next
few
weeks
democrats
have
vowed
not
to
backfill
i
e
approve
for
a
second
time
the
funding
trump
has
raided
for
the
wall
construction
they
have
called
the
administration's
refunneling
of
funds
a
perversion
of
the
appropriations
process
and
have
accused
trump
of
violating
the
constitutional
principle
of
separation
of
powers
still
it's
not
clear
how
big
of
a
fight
democrats
will
put
up
over
the
relatively
small
pot
of
money
billion
in
all
if
it
means
causing
yet
another
government
shutdown
the
government
partially
shut
down
for
days
starting
in
december
after
democrats
refused
to
go
along
with
trump's
demands
for
border
wall
funds
democrats
filed
suit
in
federal
court
over
the
border
money
grab
since
it's
illegal
for
the
executive
branch
to
spend
money
that
congress
hasn't
appropriated
a
district
court
judge
rejected
their
case
but
another
suit
brought
by
outside
groups
is
now
at
the
appeals
stage
many
members
of
congress
speculated
earlier
this
year
that
courts
would
block
the
president's
use
of
emergency
powers
but
the
supreme
court
has
allowed
wall
construction
to
begin
while
the
judicial
fight
plays
out
correction
a
prior
version
of
this
story
misstated
the
number
of
overseas
school
projects
affected
it
is
six
not
seven
