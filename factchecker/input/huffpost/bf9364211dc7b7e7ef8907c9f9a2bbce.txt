before

day
report
the
president
has
told
aides
troubled
by
his
orders
not
to
worry
about
flouting
any
laws
the
washington
post
reported
president
donald
trump
reportedly
told
officials
in
his
administration
that
he
would
pardon
them
if
they
had
to
break
any
laws
to
get
hundreds
of
miles
of
his
border
wall
built
before
the
next
presidential
election
according
to
a
report
tuesday
night
in
the
washington
post
don't
worry
i'll
pardon
you
the
president
has
allegedly
told
aides
worried
about
his
instructions
to
seize
private
land
through
eminent
domain
flout
environmental
rules
or
push
through
billion-dollar
contracts
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
reported
remarks
the
post
spoke
with
an
anonymous
administration
official
who
said
trump
was
merely
joking
when
he
made
those
statements
the
president
has
used
his
vow
to
have
miles
of
border
wall
constructed
by
the
next
election
as
an
applause
line
at
his
campaign
rallies
he
reportedly
has
instructed
aides
to
get
the
structure
built
at
any
cost
but
though
construction
has
been
active
on
the
border
almost
all
of
the
money
awarded
to
wall
contracts
has
gone
toward
replacement
fencing
and
barriers
mark
morgan
the
acting
commissioner
of
customs
and
border
protection
said
this
week
that
miles
of
fencing
had
been
replaced
but
he
moved
to
cast
that
construction
as
absolutely
a
new
wall
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
axios
reported
this
week
however
that
not
a
single
mile
of
wall
has
been
built
where
no
barrier
previously
existed
even
though
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
also
been
touting
the
replacement
barrier
as
new
the
u.s.
supreme
court
ruled
last
month
that
trump
who
has
requested
about
billion
in
total
for
the
new
wall
could
go
forward
with
plans
to
access
about
billion
from
the
pentagon
budget
to
build
the
structure
the
president
declared
a
national
emergency
in
february
in
a
bid
to
fund
it
without
congressional
approval
saying
he
had
the
authority
to
redirect
the
money
after
a
months-long
impasse
with
lawmakers
hogan
gidley
a
deputy
white
house
press
secretary
told
the
post
on
tuesday
that
any
comments
critical
of
the
wall
within
the
administration
were
merely
fabrications
by
people
who
hate
the
status
quo
president
trump
is
moving
quicker
than
anyone
in
history
to
build
the
wall
secure
the
border
and
enact
the
very
immigration
policies
the
american
people
voted
for
gidley
said
in
response
to
the
post
story
trump
alleged
that
newspaper
made
up
the
report
that
the
president
said
he
would
pardon
aides
in
order
to
to
demean
and
disparage
him
the
post
reported
earlier
this
year
that
trump
had
directed
officials
to
increase
some
security
measures
along
the
wall
despite
the
multimillion-dollar
cost
the
president
reportedly
told
aides
that
he
wants
the
barrier
to
be
painted
flat
black
a
color
that
would
absorb
heat
from
the
sun
and
make
the
metal
slats
too
hot
for
people
to
climb
he
also
told
officials
and
engineers
to
make
the
tips
of
the
slats
pointed
a
signal
that
climbing
the
barrier
could
cause
serious
injury
doing
so
on
an
estimated
miles
of
the
wall
would
cost
million
to
million
more
