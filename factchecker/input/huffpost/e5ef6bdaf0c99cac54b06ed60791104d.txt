washington
ap
migrant
children
who
were
separated
from
their
parents
at
the
u.s.
mexico
border
last
year
suffered
post-traumatic
stress
and
other
serious
mental
health
problems
according
to
a
government
watchdog
report
wednesday
the
chaotic
reunification
process
only
added
to
their
ordeal
the
associated
press
obtained
a
copy
of
the
report
in
advance
of
the
official
release
the
children
many
already
distressed
in
their
home
countries
or
by
their
journey
showed
more
fear
feelings
of
abandonment
and
post-traumatic
stress
symptoms
than
children
who
were
not
separated
according
to
a
report
from
the
inspector
general's
office
in
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
some
cried
inconsolably
others
believed
their
parents
had
abandoned
them
and
were
angry
and
confused
other
children
expressed
feelings
of
fear
or
guilt
and
became
concerned
for
their
parents
welfare
according
to
the
report
the
report
is
the
first
substantial
accounting
by
a
government
agency
on
how
family
separation
under
the
trump
administration's
zero
tolerance
policy
has
affected
the
mental
health
of
children
it
was
based
on
interviews
with
about
mental
health
clinicians
who
had
regular
interactions
with
children
but
did
not
directly
address
the
quality
of
the
care
the
children
did
receive
the
separations
have
been
widely
criticized
and
children's
health
advocates
have
said
the
kids
likely
suffered
trauma
a
second
report
by
the
watchdog
also
released
wednesday
found
that
thousands
of
childcare
workers
were
given
direct
access
to
migrant
children
before
completing
required
background
and
fingerprint
checks
one
little
boy
about
or
was
separated
from
his
father
and
did
not
know
why
according
to
the
inspector
general
he
believed
that
his
dad
was
killed
and
he
would
also
be
killed
this
child
ultimately
required
emergency
psychiatric
care
to
address
his
mental
health
distress
a
program
director
told
investigators
some
of
the
separated
children
suffered
physical
symptoms
because
of
their
mental
trauma
clinicians
reported
you
get
a
lot
of
my
chest
hurts
even
though
everything
is
fine
medically
children
describe
symptoms
every
heartbeat
hurts
i
can't
feel
my
heart
of
emotional
pain
a
clinician
told
investigators
the
report
covers
a
period
last
year
when
facilities
were
overwhelmed
under
the
zero
tolerance
policy
under
which
at
least
children
were
separated
from
their
parents
children
stayed
behind
in
border
custody
while
their
parents
were
taken
to
federal
court
for
criminal
proceedings
children
held
longer
than
hours
were
transferred
into
hhs
custody
and
placed
in
shelters
that
have
traditionally
cared
for
children
who
crossed
the
border
alone
migrant
children
stay
in
the
shelters
run
by
government-funded
organizations
until
released
to
a
sponsor
usually
a
parent
or
close
relative
previous
reports
have
highlighted
the
disorganized
reunification
effort
and
a
lack
of
government
planning
on
how
to
bring
families
together
after
they
have
been
separated
others
have
said
thousands
more
children
than
initially
reported
may
have
been
separated
the
watchdog
said
the
longer
children
were
in
custody
the
more
their
mental
health
deteriorated
and
it
recommended
minimizing
that
time
it
also
suggested
the
creation
of
better
mental
health
care
options
and
the
hiring
of
more
trained
staff
the
administration
for
children
and
families
the
hhs
division
that
manages
children
concurred
with
the
recommendations
and
said
it
had
already
begun
implementing
them
including
hiring
a
board-certified
child
adolescent
and
adult
psychiatrist
to
serve
as
a
mental
health
team
leader
department
assistant
secretary
lynn
johnson
said
in
a
letter
to
the
watchdog
that
the
average
length
of
stay
is
much
shorter
now
than
it
was
last
year
and
noted
the
report
was
not
a
clinical
review
of
treatment
she
wrote
that
significant
factors
beyond
the
agency's
control
contributed
to
the
issues
identified
in
the
report
those
included
a
surge
in
children
at
the
border
the
children's
unique
mental
health
needs
and
a
shortage
of
qualified
bilingual
clinicians
especially
in
rural
areas
she
said
that
efforts
were
made
to
bring
in
more
medical
health
professionals
but
adverse
media
coverage
and
negative
public
perception
have
hampered
efforts
to
expand
after
a
federal
judge
ordered
the
children
reunified
with
their
parents
guidance
on
how
to
do
it
kept
changing
and
that
led
to
further
anxiety
and
distress
according
to
the
report
some
facilities
said
reunifications
were
scheduled
with
little
notice
or
suddenly
canceled
in
one
case
a
child
was
moved
from
a
florida
facility
to
texas
to
be
reunited
with
her
father
after
the
child
made
several
trips
to
the
detention
center
she
was
returned
to
the
florida
facility
in
shambles
without
ever
seeing
him
investigators
visited
facilities
in
states
during
august
and
september
of
interviewing
about
mental
health
clinicians
who
had
regular
interactions
with
children
and
staff
during
the
interviews
there
were
almost
children
in
shelters
nearly
were
in
age
were
and
were
infants
to
age
at
a
minimum
each
child
in
government
custody
is
to
receive
one
counseling
session
per
week
plus
two
group
sessions
to
discuss
issues
but
the
report
found
that
mental
health
staff
were
overwhelmed
usually
there
is
one
mental
health
clinician
for
children
but
during
the
period
investigators
studied
there
were
more
than
children
for
one
clinician
a
separate
office
of
inspector
general
report
also
released
wednesday
found
of
the
facilities
reviewed
had
hired
case
managers
who
did
not
meet
office
of
refugee
resettlement
requirements
including
many
without
the
required
education
in
addition
the
review
found
of
the
facilities
didn't
have
enough
mental
health
workers
that
meant
some
children
didn't
receive
proper
treatment
the
report
found
and
some
children
who
suffered
more
severe
illnesses
self-harming
suicidal
behavior
or
actual
suicide
attempts
were
not
transferred
quickly
enough
to
residential
treatment
centers
during
a
time
when
sponsors
had
to
be
fingerprinted
children
were
held
in
facilities
for
as
long
as
days
the
fingerprints
were
sent
to
u.s.
customs
and
immigration
enforcement
and
some
people
in
the
united
states
illegally
were
arrested
advocates
said
many
potential
sponsors
feared
coming
to
get
the
children
while
the
policy
was
in
effect
after
it
was
ditched
in
march
the
average
length
of
stay
dropped
to
days
and
was
days
in
april
the
report
also
addressed
the
question
of
whether
children
were
being
given
psychotropic
medications
after
media
reports
described
the
practice
the
report
found
the
instances
were
very
minimal
about
children
overall
between
may
and
july
of
were
prescribed
antidepressants
staff
described
reluctant
children
who
didn't
want
to
take
medication
and
some
concerns
that
dosage
or
type
of
medication
may
not
have
been
right
in
the
second
report
only
four
of
the
shelters
reviewed
by
the
u.s.
health
and
human
services
inspector
general
met
all
staff
screening

caregivers
at
more
than
half
of
those
shelters
worked
with
migrant
toddlers
children
and
teens
who
were
separated
from
their
parents
or
who
were
traveling
alone
before
their
background

said
children
deserve
compassionate
care
grantees
and
contractors
that
fail
to
ensure
their
employees
are
checked
appropriately
should
not
be
allowed
to
care
for
these
children
said
portman
federal
investigators
also
found
some
shelters
relying
on
employees
to
report
their
own
criminal
histories
a
background
check
found
one
employee
who
self-certified
that
she
had
no
history
for
crimes
involving
child
abuse
had
a
third-degree
child
neglect
felony
on
her
record
the
inspector
general
found
the
federal
government
granted
waivers
from
conducting
child
protective
service
reviews
at
four
behavioral
health
residential
facilities
last
year
in
violation
of
the
agency's
rules
which
give
authority
to
grant
waivers
only
at
emergency
influx

those
waivers
for
caregivers
at
two
facilities
