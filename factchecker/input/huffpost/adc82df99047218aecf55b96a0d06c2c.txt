said
roger

as
he
sounded
the
alarm
on

farmers
dire
situation
in
trump's
failing
trade
war
the
president
of
the
national
farmers
union
has
leveled
an
astonishingly
frank
broadside
against
president
donald
trump
who
rural
voters
largely
supported
in
the
election
trade
group
leader
roger
johnson
said
in
a
radio
interview
thursday
that
it
will
take
decades
to
reverse
damage
caused
by
trump
china
he
added
is
now
a
lost
market
for
american
farmers
because
of
trump's
trade
war
trump
has
offended
the
leaders
of
pretty
much
every
ally
we
have
on
earth
and
america's
reputation
in
markets
around
the
world
has
taken
a
long-lasting
hit
johnson
said
in
an
interview
on
kfgo
radio
in
fargo
north
dakota
it's
going
to
take
much
different
behavior
from
future
presidents
in
order
to
repair
this
damage
he
said
johnson
whose
organization
represents
some
family
farms
ranches
and
fishing
enterprises
in
states
agreed
that
china
needs
to
be
held
to
account
for
trade
relationships
and
behavior
but
he
said
that
trump
would
have
been
wiser
to
approach
the
world's
second-largest
economy
with
a
team
of
allies
i
would
argue
that
it
would
be
far
more
effective
if
we
did
it
with
the
rest
of
world
instead
of
first
ticking
off
the
rest
of
the
world
and
then
trying
to
do
it
all
by
ourself
he
said
as
for
how
trump
is
dealing
with
china
johnson
added
i
don't
think
you
can
expect
to
make
the
fundamental
changes
that
are
being
asked
of
china
while
every
other
day
you're
offending
them
you're
forcing
them
to
lose
face
no
country's
going
to
make
changes
when
they're
embarrassed
along
the
way
that's
just
not
how
you
do
things
he
said
a
lot
of
folks
believe
that
china
needs
to
be
held
accountable
but
it's
the
way
it's
being
done
that's
troubling
you're
increasingly
going
to
find
people
who
sort
of
say
this
was
just
a
mistake
this
isn't
the
way
you
solve
a
real
problem
it's
just
making
things
worse
he
called
many
of
trump's
policy
decisions
very
harmful
to
agriculture
all
the
trade
disruption
has
been
enormously
damaging
johnson
said
the
u.s.
will
suffer
reputational
damage
for
literally
decades
he
also
noted
that
trade
actions
that
this
president
have
taken
have
done
damage
to
lots
of
other
parts
of
the
economy
as
well
johnson
slammed
the
decision
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
reportedly
ordered
by
trump
to
grant
waivers
to
petroleum
refineries
effectively
exempting
them
from
having
to
use
more
corn-based
ethanol
in
their
products
it
was
yet
another
blow
to
struggling
corn
farmers
in
deference
to
what
johnson
called
the
wealthiest
oil
companies
on
the
face
of
the
planet
kfgo
interviewer
joel
heitkamp
noted
you
can
see
how
mad
ag
producers
are
when
they
see
that
big
oil
got
the
exemptions
it's
like
the
light
finally
got
turned
on
and
some
of
these
guys
woke
up
farmers
are
in
a
lot
of
financial
stress
right
now
net
farm
income
is
half
of
what
it
was
six
years
ago
said
johnson
this
is
really
tough
he
warned
we're
in
a
really
really
difficult
spot
right
now
