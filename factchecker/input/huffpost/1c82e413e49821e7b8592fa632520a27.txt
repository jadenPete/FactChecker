a
presidential
candidate
wrote
in
the
columbia
journalism
review
given
that
reality
we
should
not
want
even
more
of
the
free
press
to
be
put
under
the
control
of
a
handful
of
corporations
and
benevolent
billionaires
who
can
use
their
media
empires
to
punish
their
critics
and
shield
themselves
from
scrutiny

review
newsroom
employment
across
the
u.s.
has
plummeted
since
and
the
pew
research
center
said
last
month
that
the
total
number
of
journalism
jobs
was
slashed
by
nearly
a
quarter
over
the
past
decade
the
cuts
were
largely
seen
at
newspapers
but
other
massive
digital
enterprises
have
seen
dramatic
rounds
of
layoffs
in
recent
years
including
buzzfeed
vice
and
huffpost
from
january
to
may
of
this
year
about
people
working
in
the
news
industry
were
laid
off
or
offered
a
buyout
package
according
to
an
analysis
by
bloomberg
at
the
same
time
news
companies
have
been
scrambling
for
ways
to
become
profitable
as
traditional
advertising
dollars
dry
up
or
hunted
for
billionaire
benefactors
such
as
jeff
bezos

trump's
authoritarian
bullying
of
the
media
is
totally
unacceptable
and
it
must
be
denounced
and
rejected
sanders
wrote
pointing
to
the
president's
ongoing
attacks
on
the
press
sanders
noted
that
much
of
that
cash
still
exists
and
as
of
this
year
digital
advertising
outpaces
both
print
and
television
ad
revenue
but
the
money
largely
flows
to
google
and
facebook
who
control
about
of
the
digital
advertising
market
we
need
to
rebuild
and
protect
a
diverse
and
truly
independent
press
so
that
real
journalists
can
do
the
critical
jobs
that
they
love
and
that
a
functioning
democracy
requires
sanders
said
were
he
to
unseat
trump
in
the
election
sanders
said
he
would
issue
an
immediate
moratorium
on
mergers
of
major
media
corporations
and
instead
focus
on
protections
for
local
independent
news
outlets
the
senator
also
said
he
would
appoint
an
attorney
general
to
oversee
tech
giants
like
facebook
and
google
to
stop
efforts
to
cannibalize
bilk
and
defund
news
organizations
trump's
authoritarian
bullying
of
the
media
is
totally
unacceptable
and
it
must
be
denounced
and
rejected
he
wrote
but
let
us
be
clear
that
alone
will
not
solve
the
journalism
crisis
moreover
a
further
expansion
of
oligarchic
business
models
in
the
media
industry
could
make
matters
worse
sanders
said
he
planned
to
further
support
initiatives
to
unionize
newsrooms
as
well
as
pushing
for
a
plan
that
could
see
employees
buy
their
media
outlets
through
a
stock-ownership
plan
before
the
companies
are
sold
sanders
has
been
a
leading
contender
among
the
crowded
democratic
presidential
field
a
new
national
poll
released
monday
showed
the
senator
in
a
virtual
three-way
tie
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
although
it's
still
early
to
put
much
faith
in
such
numbers
before
the
primaries
even
begin
and
other
polls
have
had
different
results
recode
notes
that
the
sanders
campaign
has
grown
frustrated
with
the
media
in
the
past
lambasting
the
corporate
media
at
times
earlier
this
month
sanders
suggested
that
bezos
influenced
the
washington
post's
coverage
and
was
more
critical
of
him
than
other
candidates
the
remarks
prompted
the
executive
editor
of
the
post
to
fire
back
calling
the
idea
a
conspiracy
theory
while
assuring
readers
that
the
newspaper
operates
with
full
independence
regardless
of
the
tiff
the
plan
presents
a
dramatic
and
novel
effort
among
the
democratic
candidates
to
better
protect
a
free
press
a
far
cry
from
trump's
blistering
criticism
of
anyone
and
everyone
critical
of
his
administration
our
constitution's
first
amendment
explicitly
protects
the
free
press
because
the
founders
understood
how
important
journalism
is
to
a
democracy
sanders
wrote
on
monday
more
than
two
centuries
after
the
constitution
was
signed
we
cannot
sit
by
and
allow
corporations
billionaires
and
demagogues
to
destroy
the
fourth
estate
nor
can
we
allow
them
to
replace
serious
reporting
with
infotainment
and
propaganda
related
coverage
you
don't
need
to
freak
out
over
every
single
horserace
poll
