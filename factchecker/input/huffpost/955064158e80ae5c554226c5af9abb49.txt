anti-semitism

august
the
rockland
gop
removed
the
video
on
thursday
but
party
chairman
lawrence
garvey
complained
in
a
statement
on
facebook
that
anyone
who
dares
speak
up
about
overdevelopment
corruption
or
education
is
immediately
labeled
as
anti-semitic
without
any
concern
for
facts
or
without
any
idea
of
the
true
issues
at
hand
county
executive
ed
day
a
republican
said
in
a
statement
that
the
content
of
the
video
was
factual
but
the
tone
and
undercurrent
were
unacceptable
he
added
that
the
concerns
about
overdevelopment
are
accurate
well-grounded
and
desperately
need
to
be
addressed
but
this
must
be
done
in
a
way
free
of
rhetoric
and
rancor
