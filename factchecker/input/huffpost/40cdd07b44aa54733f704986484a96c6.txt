reported
last
week
that
suicides
were
on
the
rise
inside
of
federal
facilities
before

that
jail
suicides
are
almost
always
preventable
suicide
has
been
the
leading
cause
of
death
inside
american
jails
in
every
year
they've
been
tracked
since
the
turn
of
the
century
in
the
last
year
in
which
federal
data
is
available
an
average
of
more
than
one
person
a
day
died
of
suicide
inside
an
american
jail
most
bop
inmates
are
individuals
serving
out
sentences
in
prisons
where
suicides
are
less
likely
than
they
are
in
jails
many
smaller
federal
districts
outsource
their
pretrial
detention
to
local
authorities
but
there
are
a
number
of
federal
districts
with
their
own
pretrial
detention
facilities
