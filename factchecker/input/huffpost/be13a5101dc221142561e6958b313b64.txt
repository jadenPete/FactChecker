pete
buttigieg
calls
trump's
altered
weather
map
literally
pathetic
it
makes
you
feel
a
kind
of
pity
for
everybody
involved
the
presidential
candidate
said
thursday
president
donald
trump's
use
of
an
outdated
and
crudely
altered
weather
map
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
responsibility
for
making
false
claims
about
hurricane
dorian's
path
is
literally
pathetic
so
says
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
who's
running
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
on
thursday
buttigieg
told
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
that
he
feels
sorry
for
the
president
given
that
he
or
someone
in
his
office
would
feel
compelled
to
go
so
far
to
protect
trump's
ego
i
feel
sorry
for
the
president
buttigieg
said
thursday
reflecting
on
the
matter
and
that
is
not
the
way
we
should
feel
about
the
most
powerful
figure
in
this
country
somebody
on
whose
wisdom
and
judgment
our
lives
literally
depend
on
wednesday
trump
presented
an
outdated
week-old
weather
map
from
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
that
predicted
dorian
would
likely
make
landfall
on
florida's
east
coast
on
trump's
map
someone
appears
to
have
used
a
sharpie
marker
to
crudely
extend
dorian's
cone
of
uncertainty
to
indicate
the
hurricane
could
hit
alabama
the
alteration
appears
to
be
an
attempt
to
defend
a
statement
the
president
made
sunday
in
which
he
warned
via
a
tweet
that
alabama
was
among
the
states
that
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
it's
a
puzzling
claim
since
noaa
models
had
by
friday
begun
to
indicate
dorian
could
take
a
more
northerly
path
the
national
weather
service
corrected
trump's
erroneous
prediction
sunday
with
a
tweet
of
its
own
instead
of
admitting
the
mistake
the
president
grew
more
adamant
about
his
falsehood
thursday
morning
what
we're
seeing
there
is
literally
pathetic
buttigieg
said
later
it
makes
you
feel
a
kind
of
pity
for
everybody
involved
and
that's
not
how
i
want
to
feel
about
the
president
whether
it's
from
my
party
or
another
one
this
is
humiliating
he
added
this
is
an
embarrassing
moment
for
our
country
and
we
seem
to
see
a
new
national
embarrassment
every
day
