washington
president
donald
trump
has
filed
financial
disclosure
statements
that
appear
to
misstate
the
value
and
profitability
of
his
scotland
golf
courses
by
million
possibly
violating
federal
laws
that
are
punishable
by
jail
time
trump
claimed
in
his
u.s.
filing
that
his
turnberry
and
aberdeen
resorts
were
each
worth
more
than
million
for
that
same
time
period
he
filed
balance
sheets
with
the
united
kingdom
government
showing
that
their
combined
debt
exceeded
their
assets
by
million
british
pounds
the
equivalent
of
million
at
the

rate
on

date
of
the
last
u.k.
filing

his
public
financial
disclosure
filed
with
the
u.s.
office
of
government
ethics
also
claims
those
two
resorts
earned
him
income
of

his
filings
with
the
u.k.
companies
house
office
in
edinburgh
for
that
period
showed
the
resorts
had
actually
lost
million
pounds
equal
to
million
his
u.s.
disclosure
statement
also
fails
to
mention

trump

from
his

to

turnberry
in

knowingly
providing
false
or
incomplete

on
that

is
a
violation
of

act
punishable
by
up
to
a

attesting

the

don't
appear
to
add
up
said
virginia
canter
an
ethics
law
expert
with
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
in
washington
she
added
though
that
oge
regulations
give
filers
a
fair
amount
of
latitude
in
determining
asset
value
that
said
it's
not
at
all
clear
after
reviewing
the
u.k.
balance
sheet
for
aberdeen
how
they
came
to
million
i
think
it
raises
legitimate
questions
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
on
the
discrepancies
between
the
u.s.
and
u.k.
filings
sheri
dillon
trump's
outside
lawyer
who
handles
his
financial
disclosures
did
not
respond
to
huffpost
queries
early
tuesday
evening
after
this
article
was
published
and
days
after
huffpost
first
sought
comment
the
trump
organization
his
family
business
that
operates
the
resorts
responded
through
chief
legal
officer
alan
garten
who
said
the
two
sets
of
statements
are
filed
under
different
accounting
and
legal
standards
as
a
result
while
both
filings
provide
financial
information
the
filings
each
have
distinct
reporting
requirements
and
standards
thus
the
two
filings
cannot
and
should
not
be
compared
garten
wrote
in
an
email
he
did
not
respond
to
follow-up
questions
about
the
widely
divergent
claims
regarding
assets
and
income
and
why
trump
failed
to
disclose
the
two
loans
a
history
of
fake
wealth
in
any
case
the
false
and
missing
information
on
his
filing
has
been
false
and
missing
on
trump's
forms
repeatedly
since
before
he
even
took
office
on
may
for
example
then-candidate
trump
also
claimed
on
his
financial
disclosure
forms
that
the
two
scotland
resorts
were
worth
more
than
million
even
though
he
filed
papers
with
companies
house
on
dec
acknowledging
that
the
courses
had
a
combined
value
of
negative
million
u.s.
filings
also
included
erroneous
information
regarding
trump's
doonbeg
resort
in
ireland
which
similarly
requires
annual
disclosures
from
privately
held
companies
in
and
trump
told
the
irish
government
that
the
course
had
lost
millions
of
dollars
million
in
all
in
that
same
period
trump
claimed
on
his
american
financial
disclosures
that
the
course
had
provided
him
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
income
totaling
million
trump's
golf
courses
in
scotland
and
ireland
offer
unique
insights
into
the
state
of
trump's
businesses
because
they
are
required
to
submit
detailed
financial
documents
annually
even
though
they
are
privately
held
in
the
united
states
where
the
vast
majority
of
trump's
businesses
are
located
there
is
no
such
disclosure
requirement
meaning
there
is
no
straightforward
way
of
determining
whether
trump
has
similarly
misstated
the
asset
value
and
profitability
of
his
u.s.
properties
americans
would
have
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
actual
financial
health
of
trump's
businesses
had
he
kept
his
initial
promise
to
release
his
tax
returns
if
he
ran
for
president
but
trump
reneged
on
that
pledge
almost
immediately
after
entering
the
race
at
first
he
claimed
he
would
release
the
returns
after
routine
audits
had
been
completed
before
eventually
arguing
that
americans
had
voted
for
him
anyway
and
that
they
were
not
interested
in
seeing
his
taxes
in
doing
so
he
became
the
first
major-party
nominee
since
watergate
to
fail
to
disclose
his
returns
trump's
supposed
great
wealth
was
a
major
selling
point
for
him
during
his
campaign
in
the
republican
primaries
weeks
after
entering
the
race
in
june
trump
declared
in
a
press
release
that
his
net
worth
was
in
excess
of
ten
billion
dollars
in
a
recent
speech
he
claimed
the
presidency
was
forcing
him
to
lose
billions
it's
probably
costing
me
from
three
to
five
billion
he
told
workers
at
a
petrochemical
plant
in
western
pennsylvania
last
week
i
don't
care
i
want
to
do
the
right
job
both
of
those
assertions
are
almost
certainly
false
in
the
book
trumpnation
business
journalist
timothy
l.
o'brien
wrote
that
trump
was
most
likely
worth
no
more
than
million
not
the
many
billions
of
dollars
he
was
claiming
at
the
time
trump
sued
him
for
defamation
but
lost
and
in
the
process
lied
dozens
of
times
about
his
business
dealings
in
a
deposition
taken
by
o'brien's
lawyers
in
national
journal
found
that
trump
had
made
so
many
poor
business
decisions
over
the
years
that
had
he
simply
taken
the
fortune
his
father
placed
him
in
charge
of
in
and
put
it
into
a
broad
index
fund
he
would
have
been
far
wealthier
than
he
wound
up
voters
backed
trump
anyway
despite
those
and
a
great
deal
of
other
published
reports
that
detailed
his
multiple
casino
bankruptcies
and
poor
track
record
in
business
republican
voters
chose
to
support
him
anyway
rick
tyler
who
worked
for
texas
sen
ted
cruz's
campaign
in
the
gop
presidential
primaries
said
republican
voters
were
not
paying
attention
to
news
coverage
that
picked
apart
trump's
creation
myth
his
ostentatious
opulence
and
his
willingness
to
flaunt
it
led
many
republicans
to
believe
that
he
possessed
the
business
acumen
needed
to
straighten
out
washington
tyler
said
republicans
should
now
acknowledge
that
assumption
was
false
fergus
cullen
a
former
chairman
of
the
new
hampshire
republican
party
and
a
trump
critic
said
he
doubts
trump's
loyal
supporters
will
care
whether
trump
is
really
as
rich
as
he
says
or
frankly
whether
he
broke
the
law
by
falsifying
his
financial
disclosure
statement
it
matters
to
me
but
does
it
matter
to
voters
i
think
we
had
an
election
on
that
three
years
ago
cullen
said
it
was
all
out
there
before
the
last
election
and
enough
voters
were
able
to
set
it
aside
if
trump
is
indeed
knowingly
providing
false
or
incomplete
information
about
his
golf
courses
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
he
has
violated
the
plain
language
requirements
of
the
financial
disclosure
form
his
very
first
filing
as
president
on
june
did
not
mention
the
he
owed
michael
cohen
for
paying
hush
money
to
a
porn
star
in
the
days
before
the
election
trump
disclosed
that
loan
in
his
filing
in
the
form
of
a
footnote
cohen
who
was
trump's
longtime
lawyer
and
fixer
is
now
in
federal
prison

pleading
guilty
to
a
variety
of
crimes
including
the
