people
including
a
u.s.
soldier
on
thursday
in
his
tweet
trump
said
they
admitted
to
the
attack
to
in
order
to
build
false

in
their

i
immediately
cancelled
the
meeting
and
called
off

the

said
what
kind

position
ghani
was

according

bombing
u.s.
envoy
zalmay
khalilzad
announced
that
the
u.s.
had
reached
an
agreement
with
the
taliban
on
principle
khalilzad
reportedly
rushed
back
to
qatar
where
his
negotiations
with
the
taliban
had
taken
place
after
the
attack
trump
has
long
been
a
proponent
of
withdrawing
the
u.s.
from
afghanistan
the
recent
peace
talks
between
u.s.
diplomats
and
the
taliban
which
were
reportedly
close
to
a
resolution
were
part
of
those
efforts
according
to
the
new
york
times
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
sunday
that
the
taliban
had
made
an
unprecedented
agreement
with
the
u.s.
to
break
with
al
qaeda
commit
to
certain
reductions
in
violence
and
meet
with
afghan
leaders
he
said
peace
negotiations
are
on
hold
for
now
but
that
the
president
is
willing
to
restart
them
if
the
taliban
delivers
on
the
promises
that
they've
made
if
it's
not
right
if
it's
not
protecting
the
american
people
if
the
conditions
aren't
appropriate
on
the
ground
and
proper
to
protect
america
we're
not
going
to
enter
into
any
deal
pompeo
said
during
an
appearance
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
trump
hasn't
decided
whether
to
pause
plans
to
withdraw
u.s.
troops
from
afghanistan
in
the
wake
of
the
collapsed
peace
talks
pompeo
said
during
an
appearance
sunday
on
abc's
this
week
we'll
be
talking
about
that
in
the
coming
days
he
said
president
trump
is
going
to
focus
with
defense
secretary
mark
esper
they
will
think
about
making
sure
we
have
the
right
force
posture
to
deliver
on
the
president's
objectives
although
the
trump
administration
has
been
working
for
months
to
broker
a
peace
deal
trump
previously
criticized
former
president
barack
obama
for
attempting
the
same
in
he
described
the
taliban
as
a
sworn
enemy
of
the
u.s.
who
facilitated
while
drawing
attention
to
the
obama
administration's
efforts
to
negotiate
with
the
insurgent
group
democrats
in
congress
pointed
out
the
irony
of
trump
inviting
the
taliban
into
the
country
four
days
before
the
th
anniversary
of
the
sept
attacks
carried
out
by
al
qaeda
you
brought
the
taliban
to
the
united
states
the
week
of
september

d-r
i.
called
republicans
hypocrites
if
obama
ever
invited
the
taliban
to
camp
david
during
the
week
of
my
point
is
that
republicans
are
hypocrites
who
will
never
criticize
president
trump
no
matter
what
he
does
but
pompeo
on
sunday
stood
by
trump's
decision
to
invite
the
taliban
which
recently
reiterated
its
support
for
the
attacks
to
camp
david
who
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
meet
with
taliban
leaders
who
have
the
blood
of
thousands
of
americans
on
their
hands
just
three
days
before
asked
fox
news
chris
wallace
pompeo
told
the
fox
news
sunday
host
that
the
white
house
had
reflected
on
the
history
of
camp
david
and
felt
the
invitation
was
appropriate
president
trump
ultimately
made
the
decision
pompeo
said
we
found
that
arrangement
acceptable
that
the
verification
was
adequate
and
we
concluded
this
was
a
perfectly
appropriate
place
lots
of
bad
folks
have
come
through
that
place
he
said
of
camp
david
there's
been
lots
of
peace
negotiations
taking
place
it's
almost
always
the
case
that
you
don't
get
to
negotiate
with
good
guys
