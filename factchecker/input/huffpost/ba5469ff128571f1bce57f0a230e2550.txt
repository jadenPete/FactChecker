said
in
a
video
posted
to
his
campaign
website
hickenlooper
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
race
after
failing
to
make
much
headway
within
the
crowded
democratic
field
he
spent
his
short
time
race
campaigning
against
the
term
socialism
often
to
frustrated
voters
while
trying
to
cast
himself
as
a
moderate
who
could
unify
the
country
i
will
never
stop
believing
that
america
can
only
move
forward
when
we
work
together
hickenlooper
said
in
a
statement
announcing
his
withdrawal
from
the
presidential
race
at
the
time
he
left
open
the
door
to
a
senate
run

many
of
his
fellow
coloradans
had
urged
him
to
campaign
to
represent
the
state
in
washington
this
morning
i'm
announcing
that
i'm
no
longer
running
for
president

the
outcome
we
were
hoping
for
every
moment
has
been
worthwhile
i'm
thankful
to
everyone
who
supported
this
campaign
and

hickenlooper
august
hickenlooper
is
hoping
to
unseat
colorado's
junior
sen
cory
gardner
r
seen
as
one
of
the
more
vulnerable
republicans
in
as
democrats
seek
to
wrest
control
of
the
upper
chamber
from
the
gop
hickenlooper
previously
served
two
terms
as
the
mayor
of
denver
followed
by
two
terms
as
colorado
governor
before
he
left
office
in
due
to
term
limits
he
joins
an
already
crowded
field
of
candidates
who
have
already
announced
bids
to
challenge
gardner
but
the
denver
post
notes
that
while
many
national
democrats
think
hickenlooper
may
be
the
party's
best
shot
at
winning
the
seat
local
candidates
have
no
plans
to
hand
him
the
race
easily
he'll
have
a
fight
on
his
hands

sen
angela
williams
told
the
paper
earlier
this
month
if
he's
going
to
switch
gears
and
run
for
the
senate
he
has
a
lot
to
explain
to
colorado
voters
this
won't
be
a
coronation
