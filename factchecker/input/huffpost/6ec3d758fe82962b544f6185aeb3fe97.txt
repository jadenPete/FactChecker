brazilian
farmers

scramble
to
satisfy
the
voracious
chinese
market
the
push
to
break
new
ground
amid
president
donald
trump's
trade
war
with
china
is
putting
increasing
pressure
on
the
amazon
rainforest
and
is
likely
linked
to
the
region's
devastating
fires
according
to
experts
there
is
concern
that
market
pressures
related
to
the
disruptions
in
global
trade
contributed
to
the
fires
in
the
amazon
a
spokesman
for
the
industry
group
the
u.s.
soybean
export
council
said
in
an
email
to
huffpost
brazil
is
america's
biggest
soybean
competitor
and
has
stepped
up
its
production
now
that
china
has
slashed
its
purchases
of
u.s.
crops
in
retaliation
for
trump's
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
soy
shipments
from
brazil
jumped
from
to
chinese
imports
from
brazil
in
the
months
through
april
amounted
to
million
tons
nearly
as
much
as
china
imported
from
the
entire
world
in
according
to
bloomberg
amid
increasing
demands
for
farm
products
from
china
brazil's
far-right
president
jair
bolsonaro
has
pledged
to
open
up
the
million-square-mile
amazon
forest
including
inside
protected
indigenous
areas
to
more
farming
and
mining
he
has
jokingly
referred
to
himself
as
captain
chainsaw
many
suspect
that
raging
fires
in
the
region
which
were
largely
unchecked
for
weeks
are
part
of
a
strategy
to
speed
up
that
policy
the
amazon
environmental
research
institute
has
concluded
that
the
recent
increase
in
the
number
of
fires
in
the
amazon
is
directly
related
to
deliberate
deforestation
the
bbc
reported
citizens
around
the
world
should
be
concerned
by
the
global
environmental
and
individual
health
impact

the
devastating

jim
sutter
ceo
of
the
soybean
export
council
said
in
a
statement
to
huffpost
meanwhile
u.s.
crops
remain
unsold
not
only
do
american
farmers
have
soybeans
to
sell
but
also
the
crops
are
generally
grown
under
far
more
stringent
environmental
standards
than
in
brazil
sutter
noted
it's
such
a
waste
gary
wertish
president
of
the
minnesota
farmers
union
told
huffpost
we
have
plenty
of
soybeans
to
sell
while
you
worry
that
more
and
more
land
is
being
put
into
production
in
brazil
to
satisfy
the
market
and
the
rainforest
is
so
crucially
important
to
the
world
the
consequences
are
devastating
not
only
for
brazil
but
also
for
the
world
the
amazon
basin
the
globe's
biggest
rainforest
and
home
to
million
species
of
plants
and
animals
is
crucial
to
regulating
global
warming
its
forests
absorb
millions
of
tons
of
carbon
emissions
each

the
group
of

agreed
at
its
summit
in

last
week
to
provide
million

other
support
to
brazil
to

firefighting
which
it
appears
bolsonaro
will
likely
reject

both
german
