answered
i
think
it's
a
problem
of
the
heart
to
be
honest
with
you
we
have
some
of
the
most
violent
video
games
that
you
can
see
president
donald
trump
blamed
gruesome
and
grisly
video
games
after
the
el
paso
attack
for
helping
to
instigate
mass
shooters
echoing
other
republicans
claims
despite
no
credible
evidence
turner
was
asked
about
looser
gun
laws
that
went
into
effect
in
texas
sunday
they
will
allow
firearms
in
public
places
like
schools
and
churches
as
well
as
foster
homes
and
rental
properties
some
of
these
will
allow
schools
to
be
protected
even
more
the
mayor
said
but
as
far
as
the
total
of
the
laws
i
haven't
seen
those
i've
been
a
little
busy
the
mayor
said
in
a
brief
interview
with
the
washington
post
the
day
of
the
shooting
there
are
a
lot
of
people
hurt
and
a
lot
of
people
scared
in
a
situation
like
this
prayer
is
the
most
important
thing
