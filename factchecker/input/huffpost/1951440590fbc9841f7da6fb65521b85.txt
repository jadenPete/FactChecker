trump
says
he
wants
to
meet
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
european
leaders
have
struggled
to
calm
the
deepening
confrontation
between
iran
and
the
united
states
since
trump
pulled
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
biarritz

u.s.
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
he
would
meet
iran's
president
under
the
right
circumstances
to
end
a
confrontation
over
a
nuclear
deal
and
that
talks
were
underway
to
see
how
countries
could
open
credit
lines
to
keep
iran's
economy
afloat
but
trump
speaking
at
a
g
summit
in
the
french
resort
of
biarritz
ruled
out
lifting
economic
sanctions
to
compensate
for
losses
suffered
by
iran
trump
told
reporters
it
was
realistic
to
envisage
a
meeting
between
him
and
president
hassan
rouhani
in
the
coming
weeks
describing
iran
as
a
country
of
tremendous
potential
i
have
a
good
feeling
i
think
he
rouhani
is
going
to
want
to
meet
and
get
their
situation
straightened
out
they
are
hurting
badly
trump
said
french
president
emmanuel
macron
host
of
the
g
summit
told
the
same
news
conference
that
rouhani
had
told
him
he
would
be
open
to
meeting
trump
macron
said
he
hoped
a
summit
between
the
two
men
could
happen
in
coming
weeks
trump
and
rouhani
head
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
september
rouhani
is
not
iran's
top
decision-maker
that
role
is
held
by
the
fiercely
anti-american
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
and
anything
agreed
at
a
trump-rouhani
encounter
would
be
subject
to
khamenei's
approval
european
leaders
have
struggled
to
calm
the
deepening
confrontation
between
iran
and
the
united
states
since
trump
pulled
washington
out
of
tehran's
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
the
iranian
economy
but
macron
has
spent
the
summer
trying
to
create
conditions
for
a
period
of
pause
to
bring
the
two
sides
back
to
the
negotiating
table
what
i
hope
is
that
in
coming
weeks
based
on
these
talks
we
can
manage
to
see
a
summit
between
president
rouhani
and
president
trump
macron
said
adding
that
he
believed
if
they
met
a
deal
could
be
struck
macron's
efforts
took
a
surprise
turn
on
sunday
when
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
who
is
under
u.s.
sanctions
flew
to
the
french
seaside
town
of
biarritz
where
the
group
of
seven
leaders
were
meeting
very
violent
force
appearing
to
refer
to
iran's
recent
combative
rhetoric
about
its
ability
to
attack
u.s.
interests
trump
suggested
iran
would
meet
violent
force
if
it
followed
through
on
its
threats
they
can't
do
what
they
were
saying
they
were
going
to
do
because
if
they
do
that
they
will
be
met
with
really
very
violent
force
so
i
think
they
are
going
to
be
good
he
said
trump
said
he
was
not
open
to
giving
iran
compensation
for
sanctions
on
its
economy
however
he
said
that
the
idea
under
discussion
would
be
for
numerous
countries
to
give
iran
a
credit
line
to
keep
it
going
no
we
are
not
paying
we
don't
pay
trump
said
but
they
may
need
some
money
to
get
them
over
a
very
rough
patch
and
if
they
do
need
money
and
it
would
be
secured
by
oil
which
to
me
is
great
security
and
they
have
a
lot
of
oil
so
we
are
really
talking
about
a
letter
of
credit
it
would
be
from
numerous
countries
numerous
countries
the
deal
between
iran
and
six
world
powers
reached
when
trump's
predecessor
barack
obama
was
in
office
aimed
to
curb
iran's
disputed
uranium
enrichment
program
in
exchange
for
the
lifting
of
many
international
sanctions
on
tehran
since
ditching
the
deal
last
year
trump
has
pursued
a
policy
of
maximum
pressure
to
try
to
force
iran
into
broader
talks
to
restrict
iran's
ballistic
missile
program
and
end
its
support
for
proxy
forces
around
the
middle
east
as
well
during
his
brief
visit
on
sunday
zarif
held
talks
withmacron
and
british
and
german
officials
before
returning
home
though
potentially
a
diplomatic
minefield
macron's
gamble
with
zarif
appears
to
have
worked
out
for
now
as
trump
onmonday
endorsed
the
french
president's
initiative
and
toned
down
his
usual
harsh
rhetoric
on
tehran
make
iran
rich
again
while
trump
reaffirmed
washington's
goal
of
extracting
further-reaching
security
concessions
from
iran
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
a
really
good
iran
really
strong
adding
thatwashington
was
not
looking
for
regime
change
i
knew
zarif
was
coming
in
and
i
respected
the
fact
that
he
was
coming
in
we're
looking
to
make
iran
rich
again
let
them
be
rich
let
them
do
well
if
they
want
trump
said
while
trump's
european
allies
also
want
fresh
negotiations
with
iran
they
believe
the
nuclear
deal
must
be
upheld
to
help
ward
off
the
risk
of
wider
war
in
the
middle
east
macron
had
already
met
zarif
in
paris
on
friday
ahead
of
the
g
summit
what
we
want
is
very
simple
it's
got
to
be
non-nuclear
as
well
trump
said
we're
going
to
talk
about
ballistic
missiles
about
the
timing
but
they
iran
have
to
stop
terrorism
i
think
they
are
going
to
change
i
really
do
trump
said
it
was
too
early
for
him
to
meet
zarif
himself
rouhani
signaled
a
readiness
to
meet
trump
if
that
helpediran
according
to
the
official
presidency
website
if
i
know
that
in
meeting
with
somebody
the
problem
of
my
country
would
be
solved
i
wouldn't
hesitate
because
the
central
issue
is
the
national
interests
of
the
country
