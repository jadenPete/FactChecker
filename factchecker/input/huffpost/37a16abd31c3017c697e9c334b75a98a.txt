you
don't
need
to
freak
out
over
every
single
horserace
poll
so
quit
it
former
vice
president
joe
biden
has
lost
his
polling
lead
in
the
democratic
primary
a
new
monmouth
university
poll
finds
sinking
into
an
effective
three-way
tie
with
sens
elizabeth
warren
mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
that's
a
striking
finding
it's
also
sharply
at
odds
with
other
polling
on
the
primary
from
this
month
most
of
which
find
biden
continuing
to
outpace
his
rivals
by
at
least
a
slim
margin
online
economist
yougov
polling
which
has
also
shown
the
race
tightening
in
recent
weeks
still
has
biden
clinging
to
a
single-digit
edge
over
his
rivals
and
surveys
that
like
monmouth
are
conducted
using
traditional
telephone
methodology
have
biden
up
by
double-digit
margins
quinnipiac
university
and
fox
news
both
have
biden
ahead
of
his
nearest
rival
by
percentage
points
while
a
cnn
ssrs
poll
put
him
up
by
points
that
doesn't
mean
the
monmouth
poll
is
necessarily
wrong
it
could
be
the
first
warning
of
an
imminent
sea
change
but
it
does
mean
it's
currently
an
outlier
given
its
relatively
small
sample
size
it's
also
one
that
carries
a
significant
margin
of
error
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
this
is
just
one
snapshot
from
one
poll
patrick
murray
monmouth's
polling
director
wrote
in
the
survey's
release
polling
is
by
nature
an
inexact
process
even
a
reputable
survey
with
rigorous
methodology
will
occasionally
turn
up
with
results
that
don't
look
like
anything
else
out
there
that's
one
reason
it's
so
important
to
look
at
any
survey
in
the
context
of
all
the
other
data
available
on
the
same
question
one
easy
way
of
doing
that
look
at
polling
aggregates
like
the
ones
run
by
fivethirtyeight
or
realclearpolitics
the
real
question
here
isn't
is
this
individual
poll
wrong
or
right
so
much
as
is
serially
myopically
obsessing
over
each
individual
horserace
poll
as
it's
released
the
best
use
of
anyone's
time
which
no
it's
probably
not
that
doesn't
mean
horserace
polls
of
the
democratic
primary
are
useless
right
now
but
it
does
mean
that
they're
best
viewed
in
ensemble
and
that
they're
still
better
equipped
to
provide
a
broad
perspective
of
the
race
rather
than
a
precise
tally
of
any
candidate's
fortunes
one
version
of
that
outlook
might
be
something
like
this
biden
still
leads
in
most
polls
with
warren
and
sanders
also
showing
strength
california
sen
kamala
harris
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
lagging
behind
and
other
candidates
rarely
managing
to
pull
even
another
version
might
be
with
so
many
voters
still
making
up
their
minds
or
torn
between
candidates
the
real
front-runner
of
the
race
is
still
undecided
that
uncertainty
is
murray's
primary
focus
as
well
the
main
takeaway
from
this
poll
is
that
the
democratic
race
has
become
volatile
he
wrote
adding
that
it
does
raise
warning
signs
of
increased
churning
in
the
democratic
nomination
contest
now
that
voters
are
starting
to
pay
closer
attention
true
polling
surges
and
plummets
by
nature
don't
tend
to
be
subtle
if
there
really
has
been
an
unequivocal
shift
in
the
race
it's
likely
to
be
reflected
across
more
polls
in
the
future
in
the
meantime
i
cannot
say
this
enough
if
you
keep
freaking
out
about
every
single
horserace
poll
you
are
going
to
have
a
miserable
