called
the

former
vice

joe
biden
slammed
president
donald
trump's
continued
inaction
on
gun
control
after
another
mass
shooting
over
the
weekend
in
texas
saying
trump
lacks
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
rein
in
the
epidemic
of
violence
with
meaningful
legislation
speaking
to
reporters
on
the
campaign
trail
in
cedar
rapids
iowa
the
democratic
front-runner
called
the
wide
availability
of
assault
weapons
irrational
there's
no
need
for
it
and
your
second
amendment
rights
are
in
no
way
violated
without
them
biden
said
i
think
there's
no
compromise
this
is
one
we
have
to
just
push
push
push
and
push
and
push
on
saturday
a
year-old
white
male
terrorized
texas
in
a
shooting
rampage
that
stretched
from
odessa
to
midland
killing
at
least
seven
people
and
injuring
others
including
a
month-old
girl
who
was
shot
in
the
face
the
president
has
no
intestinal
fortitude
to
deal
with
this
he
knows
better
biden
said
what's
he
doing
c'mon
this
is
disgraceful
the
bloodshed
came
just
four
weeks
after
a
gunman
murdered
people
at
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
less
than
hours
after
the
el
paso
attack
another
shooter
killed
nine
people
in
downtown
dayton
ohio
together
both
incidents
injured
more
than
each
time
trump
has
neglected
to
act
as
democrats
call
for
tougher
gun
laws
especially
as
the
school
year
starts
according
to
a
los
angeles
times
analysis
and
were
the
deadliest
years
on
record
for
mass
shootings
in
america
at
the
current
rate
may
rival
both
of
the
years
preceding
it
gun
violence
incidents
are
increasingly
resulting
in
much
higher
death
tolls
the
analysis
found
of
the
most
deadly
mass
shootings
in
modern
u.s.
history
have
occurred
in
the
past
two
decades
and
eight
within
the
past
five
years
that
includes
the
las
vegas
massacre
in
which
people
were
killed
