it's
been
a
year
and
we
still
don't
know
who
wrote
that
resistance
op-ed
in
the
nyt
so
who
wrote
that
new
york
times
piece
by
an
anonymous
senior
official
of
the
trump
administration
who
claimed
to
be
part
of
the
resistance
remember
when
the
new
york
times
published
an
opinion
article
in
by
an
anonymous
member
of
the
trump
administration
who
claimed
to
be
part
of
the
resistance
yeah
it's
been
one
whole
year
and
we
still
don't
know
who
wrote
it
on
sept
the
times
published
a
scathing
essay
written
anonymously
by
someone
whom
the
paper
identified
only
as
a
senior
official
in
president
donald
trump's
administration
the
op-ed
titled
i
am
part
of
the
resistance
inside
the
trump
administration
detailed
a
white
house
in
which
high-level
officials
were
allegedly
actively
working
against
the
president's
erratic
destructive
agenda
in
order
to
prevent
the
country
from
spiraling
downward
while
the
anonymous
writer
commended
trump's
policies
of
effective
deregulation
historic
tax
reform
a
more
robust
military
the
op-ed
said
senior
trump
aides
were
aware
that
the
president's
decisions
are
rooted
in
anti-democratic
ideas
and
that
many
of
his
plans
must
be
contained
by
those
in
his
administration
who
secretly
identify
with
the
so-called
resistance
the
op-ed
also
alleged
that
cabinet
members
discussed
but
never
followed
through
with
invoking
a
section
of
the
th
amendment
that
provides
a
process
for
removing
a
president
who
is
deemed
unfit
to
serve
it
may
be
cold
comfort
in
this
chaotic
era
but
americans
should
know
that
there
are
adults
in
the
room
the
op-ed
said
we
fully
recognize
what
is
happening
and
we
are
trying
to
do
what's
right
even
when
donald
trump
won't
the
op-ed
quickly
gained
traction
among
the
public
with
people
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
wondering
who
was
behind
the
article
the
times
said
it
received
a
wave
of
calls
from
readers
either
thanking
or
denouncing
the
editors
for
publishing
the
article
and
it
increased
security
in
the
newsroom
due
to
the
backlash
at
the
time
in
the
article's
immediate
aftermath
trump
called
it
a
gutless
editorial
and
demanded
that
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
investigate
who
wrote
the
article
because
the
president
said
it
was
a
national
security
threat
then-white
house
press
secretary
sarah
huckabee
sanders
tweeted
the
times
phone
number
and
encouraged
people
to
call
the
newspaper
to
complain
about
the
op-ed
though
many
used
the
number
to
praise
the
times
for
its
decision
to
publish
the
article
the
times
wrote
at
the
top
of
the
article
that
it
was
highly
unusual
for
the
newspaper
to
run
an
anonymous
op-ed
even
the
times
newsroom
which
is
separate
from
the
opinion
section
didn't
know
who
wrote
the
article
people
spent
lots
of
time
speculating
who
the
anonymous
trump
official
was
sanders
white
house
counselor
kellyanne
conway
vice
president
mike
pence
since
the
article's
publication
some
officials
suspected
of
being
the
writer
have
vehemently
denied
it
the
times
has
continued
to
hide
the
writer's
identity
and
nobody
has
come
forward
identifying
themselves
as
the
writer
tracking
who
the
writer
is
and
whether
the
person
is
still
part
of
the
internal
anti-trump
resistance
is
difficult
when
the
administration
has
a
revolving
door
of
aides
since
the
beginning
of
trump's
tenure
several
high-ranking
officials
have
either
resigned
or
were
pushed
out
of
the
administration
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
chief
of

john

manigault

u.n.

sessions
press
secretary
sean
spicer
and
communications
director
anthony
scaramucci
are
just
a
handful
while
these
departed
officials
haven't
said
whether
they
were
part
of
the
so-called
resistance
within
the
administration
some
have
spoken
out
against
trump
or
have
been
critical
of
the
administration's
decisions
since
leaving
kelly
who
also
had
served
as
trump's
homeland
security
secretary
reportedly
called
trump
an
idiot
in
front
of
aides
and
painted
himself
as
the
man
responsible
for
protecting
the
country
from
some
of
trump's
impulses
according
to
nbc
scaramucci
who
served
for
days
as
trump's
communications
director
has
repeatedly
gone
on
tv
to
disparage
the
president
saying
trump's
own
aides
absolutely
hate
the
guy's
guts
and
that
the
gop
should
replace
the
president
in
rex
tillerson
who
served
as
trump's
secretary
of
state
until
he
was
fired
over
foreign
policy
clashes
has
alleged
that
the
president's
son-in-law
and
white
house
adviser
jared
kushner
went
behind
his
back
several
times
to
hold
meetings
with
foreign
leaders
tillerson
has
also
said
that
he
had
to
be
very
concise
when
speaking
with
trump
to
keep
the
president's
attention
while
they
worked
together
mattis
who
has
remained
tight-lipped
about
criticizing
the
president
despite
their
differences
said
tuesday
that
he
will
speak
out
when
the
time's
right
mattis
appeared
to
disagree
with
trump's
military
judgment
in
his
december
resignation
letter
regardless
of
who
wrote
the
anonymous
op-ed
it
appears
that
any
sort
of
resistance
within
the
administration
has
had
little
effect
on
trump's
divisive
rhetoric
and
risky
policy
decisions
since
the
op-ed
the
president
has
thrown
migrant
families
in
unsanitary
cages
inspired
white
supremacist
violence
sparked
a
trade
war
and
been
accused
of
potentially
obstructing
an
investigation
into
russian
interference
in
the
election
