king's
endorsement
comes
after
two
mass
shootings
devastated
the
nation
earlier
this
month
one
at
an
el
paso
texas
walmart
where
an
alleged
white
supremacist
killed
people
and
another
in
downtown
dayton
ohio
where
a
gunman
killed
nine
people
combined
the
attacks
also
injured
more
than
people
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
violence
king
released
a
statement
calling
for
measured
action
on
gun
control
in
a
message
that
differed
from
the
gop's
usual
refrain
of
offering
merely
thoughts
and
prayers
for
the
victims
of
mass
shootings
the
tragic
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
demonstrate
again
the
need
to
address
gun
violence
he
said
in
the
aug
statement
sensible
gun
regulation
is
essential
as
is
psychological
study
of
who
resorts
to
gun
violence
and
why
and
what
early
indicators
there
might
be
cicilline
tweeted
on
monday
that
he
is
grateful
king
whose
district
encompasses
part
of
long
island
has
specifically
endorsed
the
assault
weapons
ban
and
he
urged
other
republican
to
follow
suit
time
for
my
other
republican
colleagues
to
stop
worrying
about
their
ratings
from
the
gun
lobby
and
start
protecting
the
lives
of
their
constituents
cicilline
said
few
signs
have
emerged
however
of
a
shift
in
gop
opposition
to
the
proposed
ban
president
donald
trump
has
vaguely
endorsed
the
toughening
of
some
gun
control
measures
following
the
most
recent
slaughters
but
he
also
declared
that
he
saw
no
political
appetite
probably
for
an
assault
weapons
ban
without
a
lobbying
effort
by
trump
a
house-passed
ban
would
likely
stall
in
the
gop-controlled
senate
a
recent
huffpost
yougov
poll
found
that
of
americans
said
they
support
an
assault
weapon
ban
a
morning
consult
politico
poll
found
that
in
voters
backing
such
a
ban
including
of
republican
women
