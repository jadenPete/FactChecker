zarif
who
is
under

had
been
scheduled
to
go
to
asia
as
part
of
a
tour
to
seek
support
for
iran
amid
the
american
campaign
against
it
since
trump
withdrew
the

from
tehran's
nuclear
deal
u.s.
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
said
trump
had
not
set
preconditions
on
negotiations
with
iran
zarif
arrived
as
fissures
emerged
among
g-
leaders
over
how
to
deal
with
iran
macron
said
the
leaders
agreed
during
a
dinner
the
night
before
that
the
french
president
could
serve
as
a
g-
messenger
to
iran
trump
denied
agreeing
to
anything
and
macron
was
forced
to
play
down
his
role
and
acknowledge
trump's
status
as
the
president
of
the
world's
number
one
power
the
french
official
also
said
that
based
on
saturday
night's
dinner
france
considers
it
important
to
check
in
with
zarif
to
continue
to
bring
positions
closer
together
and
ease
tensions
the
official
said
the
french
are
not
mediators

they
can
contribute

participate

the
g-
summit
in
biarritz
france
on
sunday
macron
said
he
has
no
formal
mandate
to
speak
for
the
g-
leaders
in
delivering
a
message
to
iran
but
that
he
would
be
able
to
address
the
issue
in
the
context
of
what
they
agreed
to
during
a
dinner
for
several
months
macron
has
taken
a
lead
role
in
trying
to
save
the
nuclear
accord
which
has
been
unraveling
since
trump
pulled
the
u.s.
out
of
the
agreement
his
office
said
the
g-
leaders
agreed
he
should
serve
as
a
go-between
with
iran
i
haven't
discussed
that
trump
said
sunday
morning
he
described
the
dinner
as
very
very
good
and
blamed
the
media
for
anything
that
implied
otherwise
but
it
seemed
from
other
accounts
that
the
previous
night's
dinner
had
been
tense
with
a
clear
divide
between
him
and
the
rest
of
the
g-
british
prime
minister
boris
johnson
greeting
macron
for
a
morning
meeting
congratulated
the
french
president
and
shook
his
hand
well
done
bien
jou
johnson
said
using
the
french
expression
for
well
played
often
uttered
in
a
successful
round
of
cards
you
did
very
well
last
night
my
god
that
was
a
difficult
one
you
did
brilliant
you
did
brilliant
he
added
tristen
naylor
deputy
director
of
the
g
research
group
described
the
invitation
as
a
wildcard
move
the
risks
to
the
french
president
were
quite
large
he
could
have
evoked
a
very
strong
and
negative
reaction
from
the
american
president
everything
from
outright
condemnation
to
actually
the
american
president
just
saying
enough
of
this
and
getting
on
the
plane
and
flying
away
naylor
said
but
the
invitation
was
also
something
of
a
mirror
of
trump's
own
high-stakes
diplomacy
something
that
we've
learned
over
the
years
about
the
american
president
is
that
what
works
with
him
what
resonates
with
him
is
surprise
is
a
big
move
something
flashy
he
said
and
the
french
president
has
taken
a
page
from
it
i
think
executed
a
maneuver
out
of
it
with
great
aplomb
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
zarif's
presence
was
parallel
to
any
g-
events
and
that
everyone
agreed
to
seek
more
talks
rather
than
tensions
she
added
it
is
absolutely
right
to
explore
every
possibility
and
what
we
discussed
yesterday
which
wasn't
a
formal
assignment
for
anyone
but
iran
certainly
should
know
what
we
discussed
the
g-
leaders
regrouped
sunday
to
focus
on
what
they
can
do
to
boost
growth
at
a
time
of
heightened
uncertainty
manufacturers
around
the
world
are
smarting
from
the
trade
dispute
between
the
u.s.
and
china
which
has
led
to
new
import
taxes
on
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars-worth
of
goods
businesses
don't
know
where
tariffs
will
be
imposed
next
the
white
house
had
said
putting
the
economy
on
the
agenda
was
trump's
idea
but
the
g-
has
for
over
four
decades
always
included
a
focus
on
the
economy
it
was
founded
as
a
response
to
the
arab
oil
embargo
in
the
s
and
the
recession
that
followed
the
backdrop
is
particularly
worrying
this
year
with
the
u.s.
economy
slowing
and
germany
and
italy
close
to
recession
meanwhile
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
in
october
and
there
is
no
agreement
on
how
it
should
happen
raising
the
possibility
of
a
disorderly
exit
that
could
wreak
havoc
for
business
in
europe
johnson
said
britain
and
europe
needed
to
prepare
for
that
saying
the
prospect
of
a
brexit
deal
was
touch
and
go
the
g-
summit
includes
the
heads
of
britain
france
germany
japan
canada
and
italy
as
well
as

macron

a
vocal
champion

change

has
challenged
trump
on
