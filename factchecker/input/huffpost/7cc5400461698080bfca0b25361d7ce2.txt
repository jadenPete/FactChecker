axios
reported
we
drop
a
bomb
inside
the
eye
of
the

it
disrupts
it
why
can't
we
do
that
according
to
the

people
at
the

wondered
what
the
fuck
but
trump
was
told
by
the
person
who
briefed
him
about
the
hurricane
that
they
would
look
into
it
one

bad

trump
denied
the
axios
report
in
a
tweet
monday
morning
calling
the
story
ridiculous
and
just
more
fake
news
not
only
would
a
nuke
not
necessarily
alter
the
path
of
a
hurricane
the
released
radioactive
fallout
would
cause
devastating
environmental
problems
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
warned
needless
to
say
this
is
not
a
good
idea
the
noaa
which
maintains
a
web
page
to
explain
how
spectacularly
bad
a
strategy
it
is

the
axios
story
