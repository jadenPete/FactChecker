i'll
break
silence
on
trump's
policies
when
the
time's
right
the
former
secretary
of
defense
has
remained
tight-lipped
about
his
views
of
the
trump
administration
saying
he
wouldn't
speak
out
from
the
cheap
seats
former
secretary
of
defense
james
mattis
who
has
refrained
from
discussing
his
differences
with
president
donald
trump
following
his
resignation
last
year
said
on
tuesday
that
he
would
speak
out
when
the
time's
right
i
don't
believe
that
if
you
leave
an
administration
over
a
matter
of
policy
that
you
then
get
out
and
start
talking
in
what
we
commonly
call
a
kiss-and-tell
now
he
said
during
a
q
a
with
council
on
foreign
relations
president
richard
haass
i
don't
think
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
in
his
december
resignation
letter
mattis
appeared
to
challenge
trump's
military
judgment
urging
him
to
take
authoritarianism
in
china
and
russia
seriously
my
views
on
treating
allies
with
respect
and
also
being
clear-eyed
about
both
malign
actors
and
strategic
competitors
are
strongly
held
and
informed
by
over
four
decades
of
immersion
in
these
issues
he
wrote
mattis
implied
that
his
own
stances
on
such
issues
were
incompatible
with
those
of
the
president
because
you
have
the
right
to
have
a
secretary
of
defense
whose
views
are
better
aligned
with
yours
on
these
and
other
subjects
i
believe
it
is
right
for
me
to
step
down
from
my
position
mattis
explained
though
nearly
a
year
has
passed
since
he
left
the
trump
administration
mattis
remains
tight-lipped
about
his
opinions
on
trump's
tenure
telling
haass
it
wasn't
yet
appropriate
for
him
to
offer
any
critiques
we've
got
a
president
and
a
secretary
of
state
and
a
secretary
of
defense
trying
to
protect
this
great
big
experiment
that
you
and
i
call
america
and
i'm
not
going
to
make
their
job
more
difficult
by
speaking
out
from
what
i
would
call
the
cheap
seats
not
responsible
for
anything
up
there
talking
about
it
he
said
taking
direct
aim
at
his
naysayers
mattis
vowed
to
remain
silent
for
now
for
those
who
say
i
have
a
responsibility
to
speak
out
i've
led
a
responsible
life
i
know
what
responsibility
is
he
said
there
will
come
a
time
when
i
speak
out
on
strategic
issues
policy
issues
that
i
do
not
have
a
question
about
but
i
need
to
give
some
period
of
time
to
those
who
have
to
carry
out
the
responsibility
to
protect
this
county
in
a
very
very
difficult
age
when
the
time's
right
to
speak
out
about
policy
or
strategy
i'll
speak
out
he
added
in
his
new
book
call
sign
chaos
learning
to
lead
released
tuesday
mattis
doesn't
level
any
attacks
on
trump
or
his
leadership
maintaining
the
same
stance
he
expressed
in
his
talk
with
haass
mattis
was
similarly
reluctant
to
comment
on
the
white
house
during
an
interview
with
pbs
newshour
that
aired
monday
refusing
to
state
whether
he
feels
trump
is
fit
for
office
i
don't
make
political
assessments
one
way
or
the
other
he
said
