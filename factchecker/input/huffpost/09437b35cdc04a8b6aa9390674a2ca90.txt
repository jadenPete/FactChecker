bernie
sanders
pursues
joe
biden
voters
as
primary
field
narrows
although
he's
closest
to
warren
ideologically
sanders
believes
voters
who
back
biden
are
the
most
persuadable
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
who
represent
the
democratic
party's
more
progressive
wing
draw
more
frequent
comparisons
than
any
other
primary
candidates
news
outlets
have
doggedly
documented
the
two
candidates
subtle
differences
and
as
warren
has
climbed
in
opinion
polls
have
implied
that
her
rise
has
come
at
sanders
expense
but
the
sanders
campaign
does
not
see
it
that
way
his
aides
argue
that
they
are
competing
more
heavily
to
win
over
voters
who
gravitate
toward
former
vice
president
joe
biden
rather
than
warren
or
any
other
candidate
biden
the
sanders
campaign
believes
attracts
the
older
working-class
voters
of
all
races
with
whom
sanders
eventually
gained
traction
in
the
election
cycle
bernie
appeals
to
younger
working-class
voters
biden
appeals
to
older
working-class
voters
ben
tulchin
the
sanders
campaign's
chief
pollster
told
huffpost
the
latter
are
some
of
the
same
voters
bernie
won
over
last
time
our
view
is
that
we
can
win
them
back
again
especially
talking
about
his
core
economic
message
when
bernie
talks
about
a
rigged
economy
propped
up
by
a
corrupt
political
system
that
really
resonates
he
added
in
keeping
with
this
approach
the
sanders
campaign's
text
messaging
program
has
a
specific
response
for
voters
who
say
they
are
supporting
biden
it
also
has
a
response
for
voters
who
say
they
are
backing
sanders
but
only
a
general
response
for
cases
where
they
say
they
are
supporting
any
other
candidate
the
sanders
campaign
which
claims
to
have
sent
million
text
messages
to
voters
shared
with
huffpost
a
text
message
that
a
volunteer
sent
a
nevada
voter
who
said
they
were
deciding
between
sanders
and
biden
thanks
for
letting
me
know
the
volunteer
replied
did
you
know
that
joe
biden
told
a
room
full
of
wall
street
billionaire
donors
that
nothing
would
fundamentally
change
if
he
became
president
i'm
for
bernie
because
he
does
think
we
need
major
change
that
pitch
seemed
to
work
the
voter
eventually
said
they'd
be
backing
sanders
biden
did
indeed
tell
a
room
full
of
wealthy
donors
that
nothing
will
fundamentally
change
for
them
at
a
june
fundraiser
his
campaign
maintains
that
biden's
full
remarks
show
he
was
saying
that
wealthy
people
would
not
need
to
give
up
their
standard
of
living
in
order
to
enact
policies
that
lift
up
all
americans
whether
one
considers
the
volunteer's
texting
appeal
fair
or
not
it
is
a
taste
of
the
kind
of
contrast
sanders
hopes
to
draw
with
biden
who
has
deployed
populist
rhetoric
about
bridging
the
income
gap
but
has
often
supported
business-friendly
policies
and
courted
the
party's
donor
class
over
the
course
of
four
and
a
half
decades
in
politics
neither
sanders
nor
warren
use
private
fundraisers
to
solicit
big
donations
trade
is
an
area
where
sanders
believes
he
has
a
significant
advantage
over
biden
with
older
working-class
voters
particularly
in
industrial
states
like
iowa
a
caucus
state
that
hosts
the
first
contest
of
the
presidential
primary
on
feb
sanders
voted
against
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
and
permanent
normal
trade
relations
with
china
which
cost
the
united
states
blue-collar
manufacturing
jobs
biden
supported
both
sanders
also
opposed
the
trans-pacific
partnership
the
now-defunct
trade
agreement
that
biden
promoted
in
his
capacity
as
then-president
barack
obama's
vice
president
exit
polling
suggests
that
drawing
a
contrast
with
hillary
clinton's
pro-free-trade
record
helped
sanders
pull
off
a
pivotal
upset
in
the
michigan
primary
in
march
the
campaign
also
sees
sanders
plans
to
reduce
the
high
cost
of
prescription
drugs
which
even
voters
on
medicare
struggle
to
pay
and
his
long-standing
support
for
expanding
social
security
benefits
as
key
selling
points
for
older
working-class
voters
one
of
biden's
main
messages
though
is
that
he's
the
most
electable
candidate
he
can
win
against
trump
he
says
in
part
because
he's
more
moderate
than
sanders
and
warren
but
tulchin
said
voters
concerned
about
electability
tend
to
skew
more
educated
and
affluent
which
are
not
the
primary
targets
of
sanders
class-centric
message
anyway
the
more
upscale
you
go
the
less
well
bernie
does
he
said
tulchin
emphasized
that
though
sanders
believes
he
can
win
over
some
of
the
white
working-class
voters
who
voted
for
obama
in
and
subsequently
switched
to
trump
the
campaign
believes
his
message
has
appeal
with
working-class
black
and
latino
voters
as
well
the
campaign
is
optimistic
about
sanders
chances
in
nevada
where
the
disproportionately
working-class
latino
population
makes
up
a
large
share
of
the
electorate
an
average
of
public
polls
in
the
state
nonetheless
shows
sanders
tied
for
second
place
with
warren
tulchin
told
huffpost
that
public
polling
data
so
far
supports
the
campaign's
view
that
biden
voters
have
a
similar
socioeconomic
profile
to
sanders
voters
in
a
national
poll
conducted
by
monmouth
university
in
late
august
sanders
came
in
first
place
among
democratic
voters
without
a
four-year
college
degree
with
support
he
was
followed
by
biden
who
had
and
warren
who
had
in
the
same
survey
biden
and
sanders
both
had
similarly
high
favorability
ratings
among
both
college-educated
and
non-college-educated
voters
while
warren
had
a
favorability
rating
with
college-educated
democrats
that
was
percentage
points
higher
than
among
those
without
a
degree
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
enjoyed
a
favorability
edge
among
college-educated
voters
at
least
as
large
as
warren's
in
addition
morning
consult's
national
poll
in
late
august
shows
that
biden
supporters
would
pick
sanders
as
their
second
choice
and
vice
versa
but
the
public
opinion
research
is
vast
enough
that
other
polls
offer
contradictory
data
for
example
a
late
august
poll
released
by
quinnipiac
university
found
that
sanders
trails
biden
among
democrats
earning
less
than
a
year
and
lags
behind
both
biden
and
warren
among
white
voters
without
a
college
degree
and
a
pew
research
center
poll
from
mid-august
found
that
more
biden
voters
would
pick
warren
or
harris
as
their
second
choice
than
would
pick
sanders
neither
the
biden
campaign
nor
the
warren
campaign
responded
to
a
request
for
comment
for
this
story
over
labor
day
weekend
huffpost
interviewed
voters
at
three
sanders
rallies
in
new
hampshire
and
maine
a
warren
rally
in
new
hampshire
and
a
labor
day
breakfast
in
maine
hosted
by
local
labor
unions
there
was
plenty
of
affinity
for
biden
and
warren
amongst
the
sanders
supporters
of
the
sanders
supporters
with
whom
huffpost
spoke
voters
cited
biden
as
their
second
choice
just
as
frequently
as
they
named
warren
some
though
were
unwilling
countenance
a
sanders
loss
others
named
other
second-choice
candidates
wayne
mcallister
who
came
to
see
sanders
in
raymond
new
hampshire
on
sunday
with
his
wife
ryann
volunteered
for
conservative
sen
ted
cruz
r-texas
in
the
election
cycle
he
got
turned
onto
sanders
message
and
progressive
politics
more
broadly
after
joining
the
iron
workers
local
union
which
endorsed
sanders
in
his
message
is
pretty
much
what
the
labor
movement
was
which
is
power
to
the
people
band
together
take
down
corporations
or
at
least
keep
them
in
check
to
make
sure
they
don't
hold
too
many
of
the
cards
that
the
worker
still
has
a
voice
that
the
worker
still
has
a
say
in
the
matter
of
what
happens
mcallister
said
and
biden
would
be
his
second
choice
mcallister
said
because
he's
one
of
the
elder
statesmen
been
around
for
a
while
joe
piccone
who
works
for
teamsters
union
local
in
maine
and
attended
the
labor
day
breakfast
in
portland
maine
said
he
was
backing
sanders
because
sanders
is
a
pro-labor
guy
biden
is
the
only
other
person
who
piccone
said
he
feels
confident
would
also
fight
for
unions
biden
has
a
track
record
with
labor
that
i'm
familiar
with
piccone
said
that's
not
being
critical
of
elizabeth
warren
that's
saying
i'm
going
with
a
known
entity
but
in
a
clear
example
of
why
the
sanders
campaign
isn't
focusing
on
warren
supporters
just
one
of
the
voters
who
told
huffpost
they're
backing
the
massachusetts
senator
said
sanders
was
their
second
choice
lisa
wenger
a
public
school
teacher
who
came
to
see
warren
speak
in
hampton
falls
new
hampshire
on
monday
and
said
that
warren's
speech
won
her
over
considers
sanders
too
far
left
asked
what
she
makes
of
people
who
liken
warren
to
sanders
wenger
said
that's
just
a
bunch
of
meshugas
