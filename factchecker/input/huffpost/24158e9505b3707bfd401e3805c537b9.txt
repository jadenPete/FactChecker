washington
ap
former
top
officials
of
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
are
assailing
the
agency
for
undermining
its
weather
forecasters
as
it
defends
president
donald
trump's
statement
from
days
ago
that
hurricane
dorian
threatened
alabama
they
say
noaa's
action
risks
the
credibility
of
the
nation's
weather
and
science
agency
and
may
even
risk
lives
dismay
came
those
who
served
under
republican
and
democratic
presidents
alike
as
leaders
in
meteorology
and
disaster
response
sized
up
a
sustained
effort
by
trump
and
his
aides
to
justify
his
warning
that
alabama
among
other
states
was
most
likely
to
be
hit
hard
by
dorian
contrary
to
forecasts
showing
alabama
was
clear
that
effort
led
noaa
to
repudiate
a
tweet
from
the
national
weather
service
the
previous
weekend
assuring
alabamans
accurately
that
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
hurricane
the
weather
service
is
part
of
noaa
and
the
tweet
came
from
its
birmingham
alabama
office
this
rewriting
history
to
satisfy
an
ego

friday
former
republican-appointed
director
of
the
national
weather
service
said
on
facebook
he
told
the
associated
press
on
saturday
we
don't
want
to
get
the
point
where
science
is
determined
by
politics
rather
than
science
and
facts
and
i'm
afraid
this
is
an
example
where
this
is
beginning
to
occur
alabama
had
never
been
included
in
hurricane
advisories
and
trump's
information
based
on
less
authoritative
graphics
than
an
official
forecast
was
outdated
even
at
the
time
in
the
tempestuous
aftermath
some
meteorologists
spoke
on
social
media
of
protesting
when
the
acting
noaa
chief
neil
jacobs
is
scheduled
to
speak
at
a
national
weather
association
meeting
tuesday
in
huntsville
alabama
former
officials
saw
a
political
hand
at
work
in
noaa's
statement
disavowing
the
birmingham
tweet
the
statement
was
issued
by
an
anonymous
spokesperson
a
departure
from
the
norm
for
federal
agencies
that
employ
people
to
speak
for
them
by
name
this
falls
into
such
uncharted
territory

you
have
science

putting
out
statements
against
their
own

for
the

i
don't

i
would
have
ever
faced
this

the

declined
to

when
asked

the

said
noaa's
leadership
is
showing
moral
cowardice
and
officials
should
have
resigned
instead
of
issuing
the
statement
chastising
the
birmingham
office
joe
friday
said
he
would
have
quit
had
he
been
in

shoes
titley
said
the
episode
might
feed
distrust
of
forecasts
that
help
people
make
life-or-death
decisions
whether
to
evacuate
for
people
who
look
for
excuses
not
to
take
action
when
their
lives
or
property
are
threatened
i
think
this
can
potentially
feed
that

and
justin

administration
said
on
facebook
the
noaa
statement
showed
either
an
embarrassing
lack
of
understanding
of
forecasting
or
a
lack
of
courage
on
their
part
by
not
supporting
the
people
in
the
field
who
are
actually
doing
the
work
heartbreaking
a
retired
chief
of
the

hurricane
forecasting
desk
james
franklin
said
on
twitter
that
the
noaa
statement
had
thrown
the
birmingham
office
under
the
bus
a
phrase
several
ex-officials
used
he
said
the
birmingham
office's
tweet
was
spot-on
and
an
appropriate
response
to
the
president's
misleading
tweet
that
morning
last
sunday
trump
tweeted
in
addition
to
florida
south
carolina
north

georgia
and

most
likely
be

much
harder

the

path
including
a
large

of

did
not
go
farther
west
than
the
eastern
third
of
georgia
the

service
in
birmingham
quickly
followed
up
with
its
tweet
which
one
meteorologist
there
said
was
prompted
by
residents
concerns
about
what
to
do
it
said
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
we
repeat
no
impacts
from

will
be
felt
across

the

that
