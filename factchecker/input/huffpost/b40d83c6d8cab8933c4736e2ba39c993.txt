democrats
cite
evidence
of
possible
misconduct
with
trump
tax
returns
a
whistleblower
apparently
contacted
house
democrats
this
summer
about
potentially
inappropriate
efforts
to
influence
an
audit
of
the
president
democrats
say
they
got
a
tip
from
a
federal
employee
that
somebody
may
have
tried
to
interfere
with
an
irs
audit
of
president
donald
trump
the
revelation
came
to
light
in
a
court
filing
in
democrats
lawsuit
seeking
the
president's
tax
returns
in
late
july
the
house
committee
on
ways
and
means
received
an
unsolicited
communication
from
a
federal
employee
setting
forth
credible
allegations
of
evidence
of
possible
misconduct
specifically
potential
inappropriate
efforts
to
influence
the
mandatory
audit
program
the
tuesday
court
filing
says
the
irs
automatically
audits
the
president
and
vice
president
every
year
democrats
have
said
they
need
copies
of
trump's
tax
returns
in
part
to
make
sure
the
audit
is
legit
democrats
sued
in
july
after
the
trump
administration
refused
to
comply
with
a
federal
tax
disclosure
law
that
has
entitled
tax
committee
chairs
to
private
tax
information
since
their
filing
in
federal
court
this
week
argued
that
district
judge
trevor
mcfadden
should
order
the
treasury
department
to
hand
over
trump's
tax
returns
without
a
trial
since
the
disclosure
law
gives
no
leeway
to
refuse
and
they
say
the
whistleblower's
material
bolsters
their
case
the
trump
administration
responded
that
the
request
for
trump's
taxes
raises
weighty
issues
about
whether
congress
is
overstepping
its
constitutional
powers
and
that
the
court
should
take
its
time
past
administrations
have
benefited
from
federal
court
cases
taking
longer
than
election
cycles
in
an
aug
letter
to
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
ways
and
means
chairman
richard
neal
d-mass
called
the
tipster's
claim
a
grave
charge
that
cast
doubt
on
mnuchin's
argument
that
there's
no
reason
to
worry
irs
agents
could
be
subject
to
political
influence
he
asked
for
a
a
rolling
production
of
documents
and
communications
of
specified
treasury
and
irs
employees
mnuchin
refused
to
cooperate
saying
he
forwarded
neal's
letter
to
the
treasury
inspector
general
for
tax
administration
an
internal
agency
watchdog
a
treasury
spokesman
declined
to
comment
the
tax
return
case
is
one
of
several
legal
battles
between
congress
and
the
administration
that
could
have
major
consequences
for
the
u.s.
system
of
government
in
the
past
courts
have
given
lawmakers
wide
latitude
for
investigations
but
trump
has
stonewalled
to
an
unprecedented
degree
