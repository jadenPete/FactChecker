fascists
turned

and
in
the
week
since
popmob
says
causa
has
received
to
support
their
work
with
latino
immigrants
and
their
families
put
another
way
each
fascist
who
turned
up
in
portland
last
weekend
ended
up
personally
raising
about
for
an
anti-fascist
cause
they
despise
associated
press
members
of
the
proud
boys
and
other
right-wing
demonstrators
march
across
the
hawthorne
bridge

a

in

oregon
on

the
group
includes
organizer
joe
biggs
in

and

members

groups
including
the
proud
boys
patriot
prayer
and
the
three
percenters
showed
up
in
portland
for
their
demonstration
on
the
city's
riverfront
which
lasted
only
minutes
and
didn't
result
in
many
violent
confrontations
with
counterprotesters
unlike
previous
rallies
during
the
presidency
of
president
donald
trump
the
event
was
organized
primarily
by
the
proud
boys
a
gang
of
militant
trump
supporters
whose
members
wear
black-and-yellow
polo
shirts
and
often
attack
leftists
in
the
streets
the
proud
boys
and
their
allies
including
the
white
supremacist
group
american
guard
have
long
track
records
of
anti-immigrant
bigotry
last
year
a
man
affiliated
with
the
proud
boys
was
filmed
saying
into
a
megaphone
that
undocumented
immigrants
should
have
their
heads
smashed
into
the
concrete
in
its
statement
popmob
said
its
fundraiser
was
in
direct
opposition
to
the
anti-immigration
rhetoric
of
the
far-right
and
the
current
administration
that
emboldens
them
showcasing
the
resilience
and
strength
of
a
community
coming
together
against
hate
popmob
drew
inspiration
for
the
fundraiser
from
residents
of
wunsiedel
germany
for
every
meter
neo-nazis
marched
through
wunsiedel
in
november
the
town
pledged
euros
to
a
group
called
exit
deutschland
which
assists
people
trying
to
escape
extremist
groups
residents
mockingly
cheered
on
the
nazis
as
they
marched
thanking
them
for
their
donations
the
fundraiser
ultimately
raised
euros
