trump's
secretly
planned
taliban
talks
are
met
with
bipartisan
backlash
the
now-canceled
negotiations
were
set
to
take
place
at
camp
david
just
days
before
the
anniversary
of
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
the
president
revealed
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
are
speaking
out
against
president
donald
trump's
now-canceled
peace
talks
with
taliban
leaders
at
camp
david
which
were
set
to
take
place
sunday
just
before
the
anniversary
of
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
in
a
round
of
cable
news
interviews
and
twitter
posts
lawmakers
rebuked
trump
who
tweeted
on
saturday
that
members
of
the
terror
group
were
supposed
to
travel
to
the
u.s.
for
negotiations
trump
said
he
had
planned
to
meet
separately
with
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
to
me
this
is
just
no
way
to
conduct
foreign
policy
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
told
cnn
on
sunday
agreeing
that
the
u.s.
should
be
engaged
in
talks
with
both
the
taliban
and
the
afghan
government
but
calling
trump's
move
a
hastily
arranged
summit
which
no
one
knew
was
happening
the
whole
thing
doesn't
quite
make
sense
to
me
and
it's
just
another
example
of
the
president
treating
foreign
policy
like
it's
some
kind
of
game
show
the
presidential
hopeful
added
this
isn't
a
game
show
these
are
terrorists
in
his
tweets
trump
said
he
nixed
the
meetings
after
finding
out
about
a
taliban
car
bombing
in
kabul
that
occurred
thursday
killing
an
american
soldier
and
other
victims
what
kind
of
people
would
kill
so
many
in
order
to
seemingly
strengthen
their
bargaining
position
he
asked
despite
the
organization's
long
history
of
such
violence
in
klobuchar's
view
the
talks
were
doomed
from
the
start
and
would
have
done
more
harm
than
good
the
way
he
conducts
foreign
policy
just
reminds
me
exactly
of
north
korea
she
said
referring
to
trump's
unprecedented
meetings
with
its
leader
kim
jong
un
he
loves
the
showmanship
he
wants
to
have
that
moment
but
then
all
the
details
aren't
done
and
we
end
up
in
a
worse
place
on
the
world
stage
than
we
were
before
echoing
klobuchar's
point
democratic
presidential
candidate
juli
n
castro
who
served
as
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
under
the
obama
administration
called
trump's
planned
negotiations
very
odd
drawing
a
parallel
to
his
elevation
of
kim
with
several
summits
it's
another
bizarre
episode
castro
said
it's
more
of
his
erratic
behavior
that
people
are
tired
of
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
believe
that
he's
going
to
lose
in
former
rep
john
delaney
d-md
another
presidential
contender
also
denounced
trump's
actions
noting
that
to
this
day
first
responders
are
still
dying
from
the
detrimental
health
effects
they
faced
at
ground
zero
his
message
came
in
reaction
to
rep
adam
kinzinger
r-ill
who
tweeted
never
should
leaders
of
a
terrorist
organization
that
hasn't
renounced
and
continues
in
evil
be
allowed
in
our
great
country
kinzinger
wasn't
the
only
republican
to
take
a
stand
on
the
matter
in
a
statement
of
her
own
rep
liz
cheney
r-wyo
said
under
no
circumstances
should
taliban
leaders
be
welcomed
to
camp
david
rep
justin
amash
i-mich
who
ditched
the
republican
party
in
july
over
its
transformation
under
trump
later
chimed
in
on
the
criticism
asking
how
about
we
end
the
war
without
inviting
the
taliban
to
dinner
on
the
week
of
