stuart's

a
request
for
comment
on
the
role
of
islamic

in
the
virginia
state
senate
race
rashid
declined
to
directly
respond
to
the
ad
which
was
first
picked
up
by
virginia
democratic
strategist
ben
tribbett
and
reported
by
the
richmond
times-dispatch
saying
it
would
be
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
office
jesus
christ
taught
to
love
thy
neighbor
that's
our
response
he
said
virginia
is
the
epicenter
of
religious
freedom
in
america
and
we
must
protect
this
legacy
while
i
am
used
to
receiving
hatred
and
threats
from
extremists
racists
and
terrorists
i
am
deeply
disturbed
to
receive
such
hatred
from
a
sitting
virginia
state
senator
the
truth
is
that
these
types
of
attacks
are
designed
to
distract
virginians
from
the
real
issues
that
have
harmed
virginia's
working
families
in
the
th
district
rashid
has
written
that
terrorism
is
not
tied
to
any
one
religion
and
cautioned
that
terms
like
radical
islam
gives
terrorists
legitimacy
they
don't
deserve
muslim
candidates
across
the
nation
no
matter
the
office
they're
running
for
the
issues
they're
running
on
or
the
positions
they
hold
frequently
face
smears
attempting
to
imply
they're
terrorists
are
sympathetic
to
terrorists
or
hate
america
in
april
president
donald
trump
tweeted
a
video
that
dishonestly
purported
to
show
rep
ilhan
omar
d-minn
downplaying
in
late
may
rashid
told
huffpost
he
had
received
a
number
of
death
threats
that
he
had
reported
to
the
fbi
about
a
month
later
federal
prosecutors
charged
one
of
those
individuals
with
issuing
a
threat
via
interstate
commerce
joseph
cecil
vandevere
from
north
carolina
had
tweeted
at
rashid
with
an
image
of
a
man
being
lynched
and
the
message
view
your
destiny
the
rhetoric
from
the
right
unfortunately
is
empowering
some
very
unhinged
people
to
make
some
really
nasty
threats
rashid
said
in
may
around
the
time
trump
was
stepping
up
his
attacks
targeting
omar
rashid
is
a
human
rights
lawyer
and
first-time
political
candidate
he
said
that
he
didn't
feel
deterred
by
the
anti-muslim
attacks
he
faced
but
believed
they
emboldened
him
to
fight
with
more
conviction
for
these
values
of
fairness
and
justice
and
inclusivity
and
pluralism
that
our
society
is
lacking
i
don't
have
any
intention
of
buying
into
the
rhetoric
of
fearmongering
or
demonizing
and
i'm
seeing
that
on
the
campaign
trail
where
people
who
admitted
they
voted
for
trump
are
literally
inviting
me
inside
their
homes
to
have
a
conversation
to
better
understand
where
it
went
wrong
and
committing
to
vote
for
me
and
even
donating
to
my
campaign
he
added
in
the
may
interview
stuart
was
elected
to
the
state
senate
in
the
richmond
times-dispatch
noted
that
he
has
honored
confederate
gen
robert
e.
lee
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
and
inaccurately
portrayed
him
as
anti-slavery
related
coverage
if
you
run
for
office
as
a
muslim
get
ready
to
be
called
a
terrorist
