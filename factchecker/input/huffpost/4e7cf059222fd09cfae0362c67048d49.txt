president
donald
trump's
campaign
manager
predicted
saturday
that
the
president
and
his
family
will
become
a
dynasty
that
will
last
for
decades
transforming
the
republican
party
while
hewing
to
conservative
values
speaking
to
a
convention
of
republican
party
delegates
in
indian
wells
california
brad
parscale
also
said
the
campaign's
goal
is
to
build
a
national
army
of
million
trained
volunteers
far
beyond
the
president's
organization
that
in
california
could
help
the
gop
retake
a
string
of
u.s.
house
seats
captured
by
democrats
last
year
the
trumps
will
be
a
dynasty
that
will
last
for
decades
propelling
the
republican
party
into
a
new
party
he
said
one
that
will
adapt
to
changing
cultures
one
must
continue
to
adapt
while
keeping
the
conservative
values
that
we
believe
in
parscale
later
declined
to
elaborate
on
his
prediction
of
a
coming
trump
dynasty
or
whether
the
president's
children
could
become
candidates
for
public
office
he
told
reporters
after
the
speech
i
just
think
they
are
a
dynasty
i
think
they
are
all
amazing
people
with
amazing
capabilities
parscale's
speech
was
a
highlight
of
the
weekend
gop
conclave
in
which
party
delegates
sought
to
map
out
an
election
strategy
in
an
increasingly
democratic
state
that
trump
lost
by
over
million
votes
in
polls
show
the
president
remains
widely
unpopular
outside
california's
depleted
gop
ranks
parscale
also
acknowledged
the
obvious
that
california
was
not
a
target
for
trump
in
the
campaign
he
declined
to
respond
directly
when
asked
by
a
reporter
if
trump
would
campaign
for
candidates
in
the
state
known
as
the
home
of
the
so-called
trump
resistance
he
said
that
would
be
the
president's
decision
this
is
not
a
swing
state
parscale
said
to
laughter
from
the
capacity
crowd
however
he
emphasized
the
campaign
would
invest
heavily
in
the
state
as
it
builds
a
sprawling
volunteer
network
that
could
help
candidates
across
the
ballot
many
of
you
are
worried
that
we
have
written
you
guys
off
that
california
doesn't
matter
parscale
said
but
there's
a
lot
of
work
out
here
to
be
done
even
so
the
outlook
for
california's
gop
in
is
challenging
the
party's
struggles
in
california
over
recent
years
are
well-documented
democrats
control
every
statewide
office
and
both
chambers
of
the
legislature
while
holding
a
nearly
million
edge
in
voter
registrations
both
u.s.
senate
seats
are
in
democratic
hands
and
the
party
has
a
edge
over
republicans
in
u.s.
house
seats
in
the
state
meanwhile
the
gop
has
withered
to
third-party
status
with
its
voters
significantly
outnumbered
by
democrats
and
independents
one
would
have
to
go
back
to
to
find
a
republican
presidential
candidate
who
carried
the
state
george
h.w.
bush
nonetheless
party
leaders
attending
the
convention
say
they
plan
to
make
an
aggressive
push
to
gain
ground
in
including
an
effort
to
win
back
u.s.
house
seats
including
several
districts
all
or
partly
in
orange
county
a
one-time
nationally
known
gop
stronghold
southeast
of
los
angeles
we
are
ready
to
take
the
fight
back
to
the
democrats
republican
national
committee
member
harmeet
dhillon
told
delegates
she
was
followed
on
stage
by
several
congressional
candidates
including
young
kim
who
is
hoping
for
a
rematch
with
rep
gil
cisneros
in
the
th
district
that
cuts
through
northern
orange
county
we
will
kick
his
butt
out
kim
said
to
hearty
applause
parscale
repeatedly
urged
the
delegates
and
activists
to
get
involved
in
the
campaign
saying
face-to-face
contact
was
the
best
way
to
persuade
voters
a
turnaround
won't
be
easy
the
california
republican
party
isn't
salvageable
at
this
time
kristin
olsen
a
former
republican
leader
in
the
state
assembly
wrote
after
the
elections
in
which
democrats
strengthened
their
grip
on
political
power
in
the
state
with
its
numbers
shriveling
the
state
gop
has
debated
for
years
whether
the
party
needs
to
turn
to
the
political
center
or
right
as
far
back
as
republican
gov
arnold
schwarzenegger
warned
the
party
was
dying
at
the
box
office
and
needed
to
claim
issues
usually
associated
with
the
democratic
agenda
including
climate
change
and
health
care
reform
the
last
significant
push
by
a
republican
presidential
candidate
to
win
california
was
in
when
george
w.
bush
was
backed
by
more
than
million
then
lost
to
democrat
al
gore
by
points
