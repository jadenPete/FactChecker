suggests
hosting
future
g
summit
at
his
miami
golf
course
the
president
floated
the
idea
of
gathering
leaders
at
trump
national
doral
which
he
owns
for
the

u.s.
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
he
would
probably
host
next
year's
group
of
seven
summit
of
developed
world
leaders
at
one
of
his
own
properties
the
trump
national
doral
golf
resort
in
miami
the
g
countries
take
it
in
turn
to
stage
the
summit
often
choosing
locations
that
show
off
areas
of
natural
beauty
trump
said
the
florida
resort
was
a
perfect
choice
both
due
to
its
size
and
the
fact
it
was
just
a
five-minute
drive
from
miami
airport
they
love
the
location
of
the
hotel
they
also
like
the
fact
is
it
right
next
to
the
airport
for
convenience
and
it
is
miami
doral
miami
so
it
is
a
great
area
he
said
during
this
year's
summit
in
the
french
coastal
town
of
biarritz
he
said
a
final
decision
had
yet
to
be
taken
but
added
we
haven't
had
anything
that
could
even
come
close
to
competing
with
it
especially
when
you
look
at
the
location
trump
has
attended
three
g
summits
in
italy
canada
and
france
on
each
occasion
the
meeting
has
been
held
far
from
any
airport
that
can
take
his
airforce
one
plane
meaning
he
has
had
to
be
shuttled
in
by
helicopter
or
by
a
smaller
plane
so
many
places
are
so
far
away
the
drive
is
so
long
they
need
helicopters
this
is
somewhere
you
can
be
at
within
minutes
of
landing
he
said
although
he
did
not
like
the
fact
he
had
to
swap
planes
in
france
trump
praised
the
set-up
in
biarritz
at
a
conference
centre
overlooking
the
atlantic
we
can
learn
from
what
they
did
here
even
architecturally
the
way
the
rooms
were
set
up
and
designed
he
said
he
however
made
clear
he
would
not
produce
any
unexpected
guests
as
france
did
by
inviting
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
to
hold
talks
on
the
sidelines
of
the
gathering
on
saturday
there
won't
be
any
surprises
