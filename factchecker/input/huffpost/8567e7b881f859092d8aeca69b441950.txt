she
was
the
only
one
prosecuted
for
a
crime
mason
was
one
of
nearly
people
who
had
a
provisional
ballot
rejected
in
her
county
during
the
election
during
the
election
almost
people
cast
a
provisional
ballot
in
tarrant
county
texas
the
vast
majority
of
which
were
ultimately
rejected
but
out
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
tried
to
vote
provisionally
but
were
ineligible
only
one
person
a
woman
named
crystal
mason
was
prosecuted
for
voting
illegally
she
was
convicted
in
state
court
and
sentenced
to
five
years
in
prison
mason's
conviction
drew
headlines
last
year
because
it
was
so
severe
mason
who
is
black
was
on
supervised
release
for
a
felony
conviction
and
says
she
had
no
idea
she
couldn't
vote
prosecutors
say
mason
is
lying
and
convicted
her
under
the
state's
illegal
voting
statute
which
says
it
is
a
crime
to
vote
or
attempt
to
vote
if
you
know
you
are
ineligible
their
key
piece
of
evidence
is
an
affidavit
mason
signed
affirming
she
was
an
eligible
voter
mason
is
appealing
her
sentence
and
a
hearing
is
set
for
sept
in
fort
worth
new
data
obtained
by
huffpost
underscores
how
unusual
mason's
prosecution
is
provisional
ballots
are
frequently
rejected
in
tarrant
county
but
mason
appears
to
have
been
singled
out
for
criminal
wrongdoing
mason's
lawyers
argue
her
decision
to
submit
a
provisional
ballot
in
did
not
amount
to
an
actual
vote
because
it
was
never
counted
they
also
argue
mason
has
a
protected
right
under
federal
law
to
cast
a
provisional
ballot
the
fact
that
thousands
of
people
have
voted
provisionally
in
tarrant
county
without
facing
criminal
consequences
could
bolster
that
claim
according
to
records
obtained
by
huffpost
provisional
ballots
in
tarrant
county
in
some
of
the
total
provisional
ballots
cast
went
uncounted
the
vast
majority
because
the
person
who
cast
the
ballot
was
not
registered
to
vote
there
it's
not
clear
why
these
people
weren't
registered
they
could
have
been
registered
to
vote
in
another
place
or
they
could
have
missed
the
state's
day
voter
registration
deadline
or
like
mason
they
could
have
had
a
previous
voter
registration
canceled
because
of
a
felony
conviction
the
high
number
of
rejected
provisional
ballots
in
appears
to
be
part
of
a
trend
in
tarrant
county
since
provisional
ballots
were
cast
in
tarrant
county
of
those
ballots
about
were
rejected
since
the
district
attorney
there
has
prosecuted
three
people
under
the
state's
illegal
voting
statute
according
to
records
obtained
by
huffpost
two
of
the
defendants
used
a
regular
ballot
one
case
involved
a
legal
permanent
resident
who
was
sentenced
to
eight
years
in
prison
after
she
voted
repeatedly
as
a
noncitizen
she
said
she
didn't
know
she
was
ineligible
the
second
case
involved
a
woman
who
voted
in
the
november
election
after
getting
convicted
of
a
felony
dwi
that
september
that
woman
is
serving
a
year
sentence
in
state
prison
mason
appears
to
be
the
only
person
in
tarrant
county
who
was
prosecuted
for
using
a
provisional
ballot
since
at
least
i
think
that
shows
the
extraordinary
and
unjustified
overreach
by
the
prosecutors
in
this
case
said
thomas
buser-clancy
an
attorney
with
the
texas
chapter
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
who
is
helping
represent
mason
a
federal
law
requires
election
officials
to
offer
provisional
ballots
as
a
safeguard
for
people
who
show
up
at
the
polls
but
find
they
aren't
on
the
rolls
or
can't
verify
their
eligibility
election
officials
review
the
ballots
after
the
polls
close
and
count
them
if
it
turns
out
the
voter
is
eligible
and
throws
them
out
if
they're
not
it's
a
requirement
born
from
the
chaos
in
florida
during
the
presidential
election
when
voters
turned
up
at
the
polls
and
suddenly
found
they
weren't
on
the
rolls
said
barry
burden
a
professor
of
political
science
at
the
university
of
wisconsin-madison
and
director
of
its
elections
research
center
a
spokeswoman
for
tarrant
county
district
attorney
sharen
wilson
r
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
nationally
the
rate
of
acceptance
for
provisional
ballots
varies
by
state
in
for
example
there
were
million
provisional
ballots
cast
and
about
a
quarter
of
them
were
rejected
nationwide
according
to
data
reported
to
the
u.s.
election
assistance
commission
in
texas
more
than
of
the
provisional
ballots
cast
were
rejected
experts
could
not
recall
other
cases
where
people
were
prosecuted
for
voting
a
provisional
ballot
the
whole
intent
of
provisional
ballots
is
to
service
voters
when
the
system
kind
of
fails
them
for
voter
registration
said
tammy
patrick
a
senior
adviser
at
the
democracy
fund
who
previously
worked
as
an
elections
official
in
maricopa
county
arizona
i
don't
think
any
other
state
is
interpreting
it
in
this
way
to
me
it
seems
inappropriate
because
it
just
doesn't
seem
like
that's
the
letter
of
the
law
or
the
intent
of
the
law
the
heart
of
the
law
aggressively
prosecuting
people
who
had
their
provisional
ballots
rejected
could
deter
legal
voters
from
trying
to
vote
said
buser-clancy
in
tarrant
county
alone
there
are
thousands
of
people
casting
provisional
ballots
for
some
reason
a
large
number
of
those
provisional
ballots
are
ultimately
being
rejected
he
said
if
prosecutors
start
sifting
through
those
and
start
deciding
that
someone
who
has
cast
a
provisional
ballot
that
is
rejected
is
at
least
under
suspicion
for
committing
a
crime
well
then
people
are
going
to
be
a
lot
less
likely
to
go
ahead
and
submit
a
provisional
ballot
in
that
circumstance
related
coverage
texas
made
an
example
out
of
crystal
mason
for
trying
to
vote
