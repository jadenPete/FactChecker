sen
kamala
harris
d-calif
is
speaking
out
following
a
friday
campaign
event
where
she
laughed
after
a
voter
asked
how
she
would
respond
to
president
donald
trump's
mentally
retarded
actions
i
don't
buy
that
argument
that
impeachment
doesn't
make
sense
said
an
audience
member
at
her
new
hampshire
event
there
needs
to
be
accountability
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
next
one
year
to
diminish
the
mentally
retarded
actions
of
this
guy
as
supporters
laughed
and
cheered
the
man's
question
harris
gave
a
chuckle
adding
well
said
well
said
i
plan
to
win
this
election
i'll
tell
you
that
the
hopeful
replied
footage
of
the
exchange
quickly
began
circulating
twitter
where
some
users
criticized
harris
response
as
hurtful
on
saturday
harris
addressed
the
matter
in
an
interview
with
cbs
news
calling
the
word
retarded
an
incredibly
offensive
term
and
emphasizing
her
longstanding
relationship
with
advocacy
for
our
disability
community
you
would
think
that
in
the
year
people
would
have
a
much
better
understanding
of
how
hurtful
a
term
like
that
can
be
but
also
the
history
behind
it
which
is
a
history
of
really
ignoring
the
needs
and
the
realities
and
the
capacity
of
our
disability
community
she
said
pressed
on
her
missed
opportunity
to
publicly
condemn
the
man's
language
during
the
event
harris
claimed
she
hadn't
heard
his
full
statement
paying
attention
only
to
an
earlier
part
of
his
remarks
i
heard
him
talk
about
the
other
stuff
and
then
that
came
later
and
it
was
not
something
that
i
really
heard
or
processed
or
in
any
way
condone
she
said
that's
for
sure
