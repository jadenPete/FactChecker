in
hilarious
self-own
as
he
mocks

for
doing
his
job

fahrenthold

him
eric
trump
had
an
embarrassing
gotcha
moment
friday
after
he
gleefully
preened
about
catching
a
pulitzer
prize-winning
washington
post
journalist
who
was
just
doing
his
job
president
donald
trump's
second
son
had
intercepted
a
message
sent
by
reporter
david
fahrenthold
apparently
seeking
off-the-record
information
from
a
trump
organization
staffer
these
are
the
tactics
used
by
the
washington
post
jeff
bezos
you
should
be
very
proud
trump
tweeted
disdainfully
that's
pretty
much
the
way
information
is
often
gathered
eric
journalists
and
twitter
critics
schooled
him
reporters
try
to
get
sources
who
can
provide
information
they
noted
fahrenthold
himself
explained
his
strategy
for
gathering
news
in
a
washington
post
tweet
after
trump's
jab
this
a
kind
of
an
email
i
send
all
the
time
said
fahrenthold
who
covers
the
trump
organization
a
lot
of
journalism
is
finding
people
who
know
something
you
want
to
know
and
reaching
out
others
were
only
too
happy
to
set
trump
straight
or
mock
him
