trump
seems
seriously
touchy
about
the
whole
nuking
hurricanes
story
the
axios
journalist
is
standing
by
his
reporting
but
the
president
seems
riled
up
that
people
might
think
he
suggested
bombing
storms
president
donald
trump
seriously
does
not
want
you
to
think
he
suggested
bombing
hurricanes
he
vehemently
denied
the
claim
for
a
third
time
on
tuesday
after
axios
dropped
a
scoop
sunday
that
said
multiple
anonymous
sources
from
the
white
house
had
attested
to
hearing
the
president
make
a
suggestion
to
nuke
hurricanes
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
making
landfall
the
reporting
offered
detailed
examples
of
the
conversations
and
briefings
in
which
they
took
place
and
one
source
described
the
aftermath
of
the
remarks
being
characterized
by
general
astonishment
what
the
fuck
what
do
we
do
with
this
they
reportedly
said
following
the
briefing
axios
whatever
that
is
sat
back
and
said
geeeee
let's
see
what
can
we
make
up
today
to
embarrass
the
president
then
they
said
why
don't
we
say
he
wants
to
bomb
a
hurricane
that
should
do
it
the
media
in
our
country
is
totally
out
of
control
trump
tweeted
on
tuesday
following
two
other
tweets
in
the
days
prior
also
denying
the
assertion
on
monday
axios
journalist
jonathan
swan
had
tweeted
a
response
to
maintain
that
he
stood
by
both
his
reporting
and
sourcing
as
ridiculous
as
the
idea
may
seem
the
concept
of
detonating
a
nuclear
bomb
in
the
eye
of
a
hurricane
has
been
floated
before
the
hurricane
research
division
of
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
noaa
has
even
published
a
report
debunking
this
particular
tropical
cyclone
myth
stating
that
the
science
simply
did
not
add
up
apart
from
the
fact
that
this
might
not
even
alter
the
storm
this
approach
neglects
the
problem
that
the
released
radioactive
fallout
would
fairly
quickly
move
with
the
tradewinds
to
affect
land
areas
and
cause
devastating
environmental
problems
the
report
said
needless
to
say
this
is
not
a
good
idea
trump
again
put
the
story
down
to
the
malicious
intentions
of
the
fake
news
saying
that
the
media
was
totally
out
of
control
fact-checking
organization
snopes
weighed
in
on
the
axios
story
rating
the
story
as
unproven
due
to
its
inability
to
independently
verify
the
claim
with
the
anonymous
sources
cited
in
the
story
swan's
report
cited
one
source
as
saying
they
had
heard
the
remarks
during
a
briefing
on
a
national
security
council
memorandum
in
which
the
comments
were
recorded
