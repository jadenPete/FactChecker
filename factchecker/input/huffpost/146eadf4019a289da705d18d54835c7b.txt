d-md
sent
four
letters
requesting
itemized
costs
and
other
documentation
regarding
pence's
controversial
stay
this
week
at
the
trump
international
golf
links
and
hotel
in
doonbeg
ireland
whether

violated
the
constitution
by
suggesting
the
next
group
of
seven
summit
be
held
at
his
miami
resort
trump
national
doral
is
the
subject
of
a
separate
inquiry
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
the
vice
president
was
forced
to
defend
his
decision
to
stay
at
trump's
irish
resort
saying
tuesday
that
it
was
close
to
his
ancestral
hometown
pence
is
of
irish
descent
critics
maintained
that
the
resort
was
not
at
all
convenient
for
pence's
purposes
as
it
is
miles
from
dublin
where
the
vice
president
was
meeting
with
irish
leaders
the
oversight
committee
also
asked
for
information
about
the
president's
stay
at
the
same
resort
in
june
which
prompted
similar
questions
over
whether
trump
was
using
the
presidency
to
enrich
himself
against
the
constitution
trump's
post-london
detour
to
his
irish
golf
course
ran
up
a
tab
of
million
footed
by
american
taxpayers
the
committee
does
not
believe
that
u.s.
taxpayer
funds
should
be
used
to
personally
enrich
president
trump
his
family
and
his
companies
cummings
wrote
in

letters
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry

y.
and
rep
steve
cohen
d-tenn
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
the
constitution
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
also
voiced
concerns
about
trump
soliciting
foreign
business
to
his
properties
particularly
when
he
floated
the
use
of
his
miami
resort
for
the
next
g-
summit
