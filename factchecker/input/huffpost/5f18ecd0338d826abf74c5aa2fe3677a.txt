jokes
he's
not
going
nuts
after
repeated
campaign
trail
gaffes
the
democratic
frontrunner's
foot-in-mouth
moments
are
piling
up
former
vice
president
joe
biden
joked
to
his
new
hampshire
supporters
that
he
isn't
going
nuts
following
a
string
of
campaign
trail
gaffes
the
latest
in
which
he
forgot
the
location
of
the
dartmouth
college
building
where
he
delivered
a
speech
on
friday
i
want
to
be
clear
i'm
not
going
nuts
the
democratic
frontrunner
said
later
that
day
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
the
medical
school
or
where
the
hell
i
spoke
but
it
was
on
the
campus
the
lighthearted
remarks
came
just
one
day
before
biden
made
another
slip
up
in
new
hampshire
while
speaking
with
a
reporter
who
asked
for
his
impression
of
keene
a
city
in
southwest
new
hampshire
he
accidentally
referred
to
the
state
as
vermont
i
love
this
place
the
hopeful
said
what's
not
to
like
about
vermont
in
terms
of
the
beauty
of
it
and
what
a
neat
town
this
is
sort
of
a
scenic
beautiful
town
the
mayor's
been
a
good
guy
and
everybody's
been
really
friendly
on
tuesday
biden
slipped
up
again
during
a
speech
in
iowa
where
he
said
that
robert
f.
kennedy
and
martin
luther
king
jr
were
assassinated
in
the
s
both
were
killed
in
meanwhile
biden's
opponents
including
republican
national
committee
spokesperson
elizabeth
harrington
and
kayleigh
mcenany
national
press
secretary
for
president
donald
trump's
re-election
campaign
have
seized
on
the
mistakes
tweeting
they
can't
take
him
anywhere
and
that
he
has
completely
lost
it
earlier
this
month
biden
made
additional
headlines
for
stating
during
a
separate
iowa
speech
that
poor
kids
are
just
as
bright
just
as
talented
as
white
kids
quickly
adding
wealthy
kids
black
kids
asian
kids
no
i
really
mean
it
but
think
how
we
think
about
it
in
response
trump
who
has
himself
racked
up
numerous
foot-in-mouth
moments
or
made
outright
offensive
remarks
claimed
that
biden
is
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
and
that
he
is
not
somebody
you
can
have
as
your
president
defending
biden
symone
sanders
his
senior
adviser
urged
the
public
in
a
cnn
interview
to
stop
focusing
on
his
errors
if
we're
going
to
elevate
the
conversation
we
cannot
allow
this
election
to
devolve
in
a
tit-for-tat
over
name-calling
and
gaffes
again
something
that
does
not
matter
she
said
this
is
not
something
that's
registering
with
the
american
people
