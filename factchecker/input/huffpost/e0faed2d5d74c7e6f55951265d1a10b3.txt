a

a
group
of
wealthy

that

france
britain
canada
germany
italy
japan
and
the

he
invited
asian
african
and
latin
american
leaders
to
join
them
for
a
global
push
on
these
issues
however
in
a
bleak
assessment
of
relations
between
once-close
allies
european
council
president
donald
tusk
said
it
was
getting
increasingly
hard
to
find
common
ground
this
is
another
g
summit
which
will
be
a
difficult
test
of
unity
and
solidarity
of
the
free
world
and
its
leaders
he
told
reporters
ahead
of
the
meeting
this
may
be
the
last
moment
to
restore
our
political
community
u.s.
president
donald
trump
brought
last
year's
g
summit
to
an
acrimonious
end
walking
out
early
from
the
gathering
incanada
and
rejecting
the
final
communique
trump
arrived
in
france
a
day
after
responding
to
a
new
round
of
chinese
tariffs
by
announcing
washington
would
impose
an
additional
duty
on
some
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
the
latest
tit-for-tat
trade
war
escalation
by
the
world's
two
largest
economies
so
far
so
good
trump
told
reporters
as
he
sat
on
a
sea
front
terrace
with
macron
saying
the
two
leaders
had
a
special
relationship
we'll
accomplish
a
lot
this
weekend
macron
listed
foreign
policy
issues
the
two
would
address
including
libya
syria
and
north
korea
adding
that
they
shared
the
objective
of
preventing
iran
from
obtaining
nuclear
weapons
however
the
initial
smiles
could
not
disguise
their
opposing
approaches
to
many
problems
including
the
knotty
question
of
protectionism
and
tax
before
his
arrival
trump
repeated
a
threat
to
tax
french
wines
in
retaliation
for
a
new
french
levy
on
digital
services
which
he
says
unfairly
targets
u.s.
companies
two
u.s.
officials
said
the
trump
delegation
was
also
irked
that
macron
had
skewed
the
focus
of
the
g
meeting
to
niche
issues
at
the
expense
of
the
global
economy
which
many
leaders
worry
is
slowing
sharply
and
at
risk
of
slipping
into
recession

macron
opened
the
summit
with
a
dinner
at
the
base
of
a
cliff
top
lighthouse
overlooking
biarritz
at
which
a
menu
of
piperade
a
basque
vegetable
specialty
tuna
and
french
cheeses
awaited
the
leaders
adding
to
the
unpredictable
dynamic
between
the
g
leaders
are
the
new
realities
facing
brexit-bound
britain
dwindling
influence
in
europe
and
growing
dependency
on
the
united
states
new
prime
minister
boris
johnson
will
want
to
strike
a
balance
between
not
alienating
britain's
european
allies
and
not
irritating
trump
and
possibly
jeopardizing
future
trade
ties
johnson
and
trump
will
hold
bilateral
talks
on
sunday
morning
johnson
and
european
council
head
donald
tusk
sparred
before
the
summit
over
who
would
be
to
blame
if
britain
leaves
the
eu
on
oct
without
a
withdrawal
agreement
in
place
tusk
told
reporters
he
was
open
to
ideas
from
johnson
on
how
to
avoid
a
no-deal
brexit
when
the
two
men
meet
on
sunday
i
still
hope
that
pm
johnson
will
not
like
to
go
down
in
history
as
mr
no
deal
said
tusk
who
as
council
president
leads
the
political
direction
of
the
nation
european
union
johnson
who
has
said
since
he
took
office
last
month
that
he
will
take
the
country
out
of
the
bloc
on
oct
regardless
of
whether
a
deal
can
be
reached
later
retorted
that
it
would
be
tusk
himself
who
would
carry
the
mantle
if
britain
could
not
secure
a
new
withdrawal
agreement
i
would
say
to
our
friends
in
the
eu
if
they
don't
want
a
no-deal
brexit
then
we've
got
to
get
rid
of
the
backstop
from
the
treaty
johnson
told
reporters
referring
to
the
irish
border
protocol
that
would
keep
the
border
between
northernireland
and
eu
member
ireland
open
after
brexit
if
donald
tusk
doesn't
want
to
go
down
as
mr
no
deal
then
i
hope
that
point
will
be
borne
in
mind
by
him
too
johnson
said
on
his
flight
to
france
johnson
is
trying
to
persuade
eu
leaders
to
drop
the
backstop
from
a
withdrawal
agreement
that
was
negotiated
by
his
predecessor
but
rejected
three
times
by
the
british
parliament
as
the
united
kingdom
struggles
to
fulfill
a
referendum
vote
to
leave
the
bloc
not
the
way
to
proceed
despite
the
brexit
tensions
diplomats
played
down
the
likelihood
of
trump
and
johnson
joining
hands
against
the
rest
citing
britain's
foreign
policy
alignment
with
europe
on
issues
from
iran
and
trade
to
climate
change
there
won't
be
a
g
one
senior
g
diplomat
said
indeed
johnson
said
he
would
tell
trump
to
pull
back
from
a
trade
war
that
is
already
destabilizing
economic
growth
around
the
world
this
is
not
the
way
to
proceed
he
said
apart
from
everything
else
those
who
support
the
tariffs
are
at
risk
of
incurring
the
blame
for
the
downturn
in
the
global
economy
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
that
is
true
anti-summit
protests
have
become
common
and
on
saturday
thousands
of
anti-globalization
activists
basque
separatists
and
yellow
vest
protesters
marched
peacefully
across
france's
border
with
spain
to
demand
action
from
the
leaders
it's
more
money
for
the
rich
and
nothing
for
the
poor
said
alain
missana
an
electrician
wearing
a
yellow
vest-symbol
of
anti-government
protests
that
have
rattled
france
for
months
eu
leaders
piled
pressure
on
friday
on
brazilian
president
jair
bolsonaro
over
fires
raging
in
the
amazon
rainforest
even
so
britain
and
germany
were
at
odds
with
macron's
decision
to
pressure
brazil
by
blocking
a
trade
deal
between
theeu
and
the
mercosur
group
of
brazil
argentina
uruguay
and
paraguay
a
spokesman
for
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
not
concluding
the
trade
deal
was
not
the
appropriate
answer
to
what
is
happening
in
brazil
now
the
uk's
johnson
also
appeared
to
disagree
with
macron
on
how
to
respond
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
who
will
take
any
excuse
at
all
to
interfere
with
trade
and
to
frustrate
trade
deals
and
i
don't
want
to
see
