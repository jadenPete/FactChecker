altered
her
work
schedule
and
has
pledged
to
remain
on
the

as
long
as
she
is
capable

tuesday

told
npr's
nina
totenberg
that
she
kept
working
through
her
surgeries
to
help
move
past
any
lingering
pain
i
think
my
work
is
what
saved
me
because
instead
of
dwelling
on
my
physical
discomforts
ginsburg
said
if
i
have
an
opinion
to
write
or
i
have
a
brief
to
read
i
know
i've
just
got
to
get
it
done
and
so
i
have
to
get
over
it
she
said
she
didn't
cancel
the
appearance
on
tuesday
night
because
she
had
promised
the
clinton
library
that
she'd
be
there
prompting
the
crowd
to
break
into
applause
and
chants
of
rbg
rbg
former
president
clinton
praised
ginsburg's
work
over
the
past
years
during
the
event
pointing
to
her
long
history
of
landmark
opinions
and
blistering
dissents
he
also
noted
that
ginsburg
who
was
just
the
second
woman
ever
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
had
already
proved
herself
a
hero
long
before
she
was
selected
to
join
the
bench
late
last
month
ginsburg
made
her
first
appearance
after
the
pancreatic
cancer
treatment
and
referenced
her
cult
status
among
liberals
and
her
iconic
nickname
it
was
beyond
my
wildest
imagination
that
i
would
one
day
become
the
notorious
rbg
she
said
if
i
am
notorious
it
is
because
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
alive
and
a
lawyer
in
the
s
then
and
continuing
through
the
s
for
the
first
time
in
history
it
became
possible
to
urge
before
courts
successfully
that
equal
justice
under
law
requires
all
arms
of
government
to
regard
women
as
persons
equal
in
stature
to
men
