the
trump
administration
broke
the
law
when
it
kept
national
parks
open
during
the
weekslong
government
shutdown
by
raiding
park
entrance
fees
a
congressional
watchdog
found
the
department
of
interior
unlawfully
spent
money
collected
from
park
visitors
to
clean
restrooms
and
collect
trash
at
parks
during
the
shutdown
from
dec
to
jan
when
many
park
employees
were
furloughed
the
u.s.
government
accountability
office
reported
thursday
the
gao
demanded
the
interior
department
adjust
its
accounts
report
its
violations
to
congress
and
enumerate
actions
it
has
taken
to
prevent
recurring
violations
in
the
event
of
future
funding
lapses
infractions
in
the
event
of
another
shutdown
the
gao
warned
will
be
treated
as
knowing
and
willful
violations
of
the
law
president
donald
trump's
demand
for
funding
for
his
promised
border
wall
sparked
what
became
the
longest
federal
government
shutdown
in
history
trump's
administration
sought
to
avoid
shuttering
parks
as
was
done
during
a
shutdown
during
president
barack
obama's
administration
even
though
critics
warned
that
leaving
them
open
placed
visitors
and
unguarded
natural
resources
at
risk
the
gao
said
the
interior
department's
moves
to
keep
parks
open
violated
the
federal
lands
recreation
enhancement
act
which
allows
parks
to
charge
visitor
fees
primarily
for
improvements
and
the
antideficiency
act
which
places
constraints
on
federal
spending
to
have
kept
parks
open
legally
the
interior
department
would
have
had
to
use
funds
that
had
been
appropriated
by
congress
the
gao
said
an
interior
spokesperson
criticized
the
gao
report
saying
the
watchdog
reached
their
conclusion
prematurely
and
without
regard
for
all
of
the
facts
we
completely
disagree
with
the
gao's
erroneous
opinion
regarding
our
appropriate
and
lawful
use
of
park
fees
the
spokesperson
said
the
department
acted
well
within
its
legal
authority
to
clean
up
restrooms
and
pick
up
trash
so
the
american
people
could
enjoy
their
national
parks
within
days
of
the
trump
shutdown
park
furloughs
led
to
piles
of
garbage
and
human
waste
raising
health
concerns
two
weeks
into
the
shutdown
national
park
service
deputy
director
daniel
smith
said
spending
entrance
fees
was
an
extraordinary
step
to
ensure
that
parks
are
protected
and
that
visitors
can
continue
to
access
parks
with
limited
basic
services
