he
plans
to
resign
his

the
end

he
also
had

in

isakson
fractured
four

and
tore
his
rotator
cuff
after
he
fell
in
his
d.c.
apartment
in
my
years
in
elected
office
i
have
always
put
my
constituents
and
my
state
of
georgia
first
he
said
in
a
statement
with
the
mounting
health
challenges
i
am
facing
i
have
concluded
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
do
the
job
over
the
long
term
in
the
manner
the
citizens
of
georgia
deserve
it
goes
against
every
fiber
of
my
being
to
leave
in
the
middle
of
my
senate
term
but
i
know
it's
the
right
thing
to
do
on
behalf
of
my
state
isakson's
resignation
sets
off
a
political
free-for-all
in
the
state
with
both
senate
seats
up
for
grabs
in
the
senator's
term
ends
in
per
the
national
conference
of
state
legislators
the
governor
gets
to
appoint
someone
to
fill
a
senate
vacancy
with
the
appointee
serving
until
the
next
regularly
scheduled
statewide
general
election
which
will
be
in
georgia
sen
david
perdue
r
is
up
for
reelection
in
with
now
two
senate
seats
up
for
election
in
it
has
never
been
clearer
that
the
path
for
democratic
victory
runs
through
georgia
the
democratic
party
of
georgia
said
in
a
statement
we
are
the
battleground
state
and
georgia
democrats
are
ready
to
fight
and
deliver
both
the
senate
and
the
presidency
for
democrats
across
the
country
in
it's
unclear
whom
georgia
gov
brian
kemp
r
will
appoint
to
the
seat
stacey
abrams
who
narrowly
lost
to
kemp
in
amid
allegations
of
gop
voter
suppression
quickly
ruled
out
a
run
for
either
seat
on
wednesday
if
she
entered
the
fray
she
would
immediately
be
the
democratic
front-runner
after
attracting
national
attention
and
support
after
her
high-profile
gubernatorial
bid
a
spokesperson
for
abrams
said
she's
devoted
to
an
effort
to
fight
voter
suppression
and
will
not
be
running
our
thoughts
are
with
senator
isakson
and
his
family
said
abrams
spokesman
seth
bringman
in
an
email
to
huffpost
leader
abrams
focus
will
not
change
she
will
lead
voter
protection
efforts
in
key
states
across
the
country
and
make
sure
democrats
are
successful
in
georgia
in
while
she
will
not
be
a
candidate
herself
she
is
committed
to
helping
democratic
candidates
win
both
senate
races
next
year
the
newly
open
seat
may
shuffle
the
dynamics
of
the
perdue
race
as
well
as
democrats
decide
whether
to
run
against
a
sitting
senator
or
an
appointee
with
a
shorter
track
record
this
is
yet
another
seat
republicans
will
need
to
defend
next
year
in
an
increasingly
competitive
battleground
where
the
president's
approval
has
plunged
by
double
digits
since
taking
office
said
stewart
boss
spokesman
for
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
there
are
three
democrats
