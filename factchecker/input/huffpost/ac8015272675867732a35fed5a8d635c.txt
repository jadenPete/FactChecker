judge
blocks
missouri's
week
abortion
ban
from
going
into
effect
the
widely
protested
law
was
set
to
go
into
effect
the
next
day
a
judge
has
temporarily
blocked
one
of
the
country's
most
restrictive
abortion
laws
from
going
into
effect
in
missouri
the
next
day
saying
a
lawsuit
over
the
statute's
constitutionality
needs
to
play
out
before
the
state
can
enforce
it
tuesday's
decision
from
u.s.
district
judge
howard
sachs
comes
amid
an
ongoing
lawsuit
planned
parenthood
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
of
missouri
filed
over
the
state's
ban
on
nearly
all
abortions
at
eight
weeks
of
pregnancy
which
gov
mike
parson
r
signed
into
law
in
may
in
his
ruling
sachs
said
he
exercises
caution
when
delaying
a
state
law
but
that
the
legislation
seems
designed
as
a
protest
against
supreme
court
rulings
against
such
abortion
bans
however
formulated
the
legislation
on
its
face
conflicts
with
the
supreme
court
ruling
that
neither
legislative
nor
judicial
limits
on
abortion
can
be
measured
by
specified
weeks
of
development
of
a
fetus
he
said
it
is
thus
highly
likely
he
continued
that
the
listed
weekly
time
limits
on
abortions
will
be
ruled
invalid
in
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
the
law
in
question
also
prohibits
doctors
from
performing
abortions
if
they
know
the
patient
is
seeking
the
abortion
because
of
indications
the
fetus
will
be
born
with
down
syndrome
additionally
it
outlaws
minors
from
obtaining
an
abortion
without
written
parental
consent
in
most
cases
sachs
said
he
made
his
decision
after
considering
the
irreparable
harm
the
ban
could
have
on
women
in
missouri
one
of
six
states
with
only
one
clinic
providing
abortions
opponents
of
the
law
didn't
sugarcoat
their
concerns
when
it
came
up
for
a
final
house
vote
in
may
