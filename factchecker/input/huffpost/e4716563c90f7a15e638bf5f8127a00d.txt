messing
on
twitter
thursday

nbc
fire
the
actress
because
she
asked
for
a
list
of
attendees
at
an
upcoming
fundraiser
for
the
president
trump
tweeted
two
borderline
incoherent
missives
about
messing
in
which
he
compared
her
to
disgraced
comedian
roseanne
barr
barr
famously
made
racist
comments
about
former
obama
white
house
adviser
valerie
jarrett
last
year
which
led
to
the
cancellation
of
her
roseanne
revival
in
addition
to
calling
messing
the
mess
trump
wrote
in
his
tweets
that
if
messing
were
barr
she'd
have
been
thrown
off
television
despite
having
higher
ratings
for
her
show
will
grace
will
fake

nbc
allow
a
mccarthy
style
racist
to
continue
asked

watch
the
double
standard
trump
was
referring
to
a
tweet
from
messing
last
week
in
which
she
responded
to
a
piece
in
the
hollywood
reporter
about
a
beverly
hills
fundraiser
for
the
president
please
print
a
list
of
all
attendees
please
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
wrote
the
year-old
messing's
tweet
got
a
mixed
reception
as
some
pushed
back
to
argue
that
she
was
asking
for
a
blacklist
while
others
insisted
that
those
who
support
trump
should
stand
by
their
convictions
trump's
comment
about
the
terrible
things
she
said
about
blacks
and
mental
illness
is
referring
to
the
hashtag
racistdebramessing
which
trended
earlier
this
week
after
she
liked
the
image
of
a
church
sign
that
called
black
trump
voters
mentally
ill
she
has
since
apologized
despite
the
president's
distaste
for
the
actress
who
has
long
been
a
critic
of
trump
the
first
family
and
outspoken
supporters
of
the
administration
nbc
doesn't
look
to
be
canceling
will
grace
any
time
soon
