california's
red
flag
law
may
be
working
to
stop
mass
shootings
a
study
of
individuals
barred
from
owning
firearms
found
none
were
later
involved
in
gun
violence
so-called
red
flag
laws
a
tool
to
temporarily
keep
firearms
away
from
people
whose
families
think
they
pose
public
danger
have
gained
renewed
attention
in
recent
weeks
as
lawmakers
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
search
for
middle-ground
responses
to
the
recent
wave
of
mass
shootings
as
of
this
week
supporters
of
those
laws
can
point
to
new
evidence
that
they
may
actually
work
research
published
tuesday
from
the
university
of
california
davis
school
of
medicine's
violence
prevention
research
program
found
in
a
study
of
people
who
were
either
blocked
from
purchasing
guns
or
forced
to
give
up
the
ones
they
already
owned
under
california's
red
flag
law
that
none
went
on
to
shoot
themselves
or
others
t
hese
cases
suggest
that
this
urgent
individualized
intervention
can
play
a
role
in
efforts
to
prevent
mass
shootings
in
health
care
settings
and
elsewhere
the
authors
wrote
in
the
study
which
was
published
in
the
annals
of
internal
medicine
after
courts
provided
the
researchers
with
records
for
of
the
people
targeted
by
california's
red
flag
law
between
and
they
narrowed
in
on
the
cases
in
which
both
the
court
order
was
actually
applied
and
the
at-risk
person
had
firearm
access
the
subjects
included
a
number
of
teenagers
including
a
year-old
boy
reported
by
his
school
after
he
posted
videos
of
himself
using
guns
and
making
racist
remarks
and
favorable
comments
about
school
shootings
online
his
father
owned
a
mm
semiautomatic
pistol
and
a
caliber
rifle
several
other
subjects
in
the
study
had
threatened
violence
against
co-workers
family
members
medical
professionals
and
other
authorities
though
it's
impossible
to
know
how
those
individuals
would
have
behaved
had
the
courts
not
taken
action
as
the
researchers
acknowledge
data
shows
mass
shooters
often
exhibit
the
behavior
that
prompts
a
red
flag
order
according
to
department
of
homeland
security
statistics
from
recent
years
nearly
every
mass
shooter
made
threats
of
violence
prior
to
carrying
out
their
attacks
previous
research
into
red
flag
laws
has
not
delved
into
their
efficacy
of
preventing
mass
shootings
the
study
noted
until
now
studies
had
mainly
explored
whether
the
laws
were
effective
at
preventing
suicide
a
report
from
the
journal
psychiatric
services
for
example
found
that
gun
suicides
declined
significantly
in
connecticut
and
indiana
after
they
implemented
red
flag
laws
this
study
comes
as
the
california
legislature
weighs
bills
that
would
strengthen
the
state's
red
flag
law
including
efforts
to
expand
a
person's
firearm
ban
from
one
year
to
five
broaden
who
can
report
a
person
and
better
train
police
on
how
to
implement
the
law
california
was
the
first
of
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
to
pass
some
type
of
red
flag
law
and
it
remains
one
of
the
strictest
in
a
rare
break
from
gun
lobbying
groups
president
donald
trump
said
earlier
this
month
that
he
supported
more
red
flag
laws
related
coverage
after
recent
mass
shootings
red
flag
laws
touted
as
means
to
prevent
gun
violence
trump
supporters
at
manchester
rally
oppose
red
flag
laws
divided
on
background
checks
schumer
says
he
won't
settle
for
only
red
flag
laws
after
mass
shootings
