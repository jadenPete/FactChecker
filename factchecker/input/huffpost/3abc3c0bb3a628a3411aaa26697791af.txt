sometimes
treating
pain
is
as
important
as
treating
disease
why
palliative
care
can
make
such
a
difference
and
why
so
few
people
get
it
amy
berman
of
new
york
city
had
been
living
with
inflammatory
breast
cancer
for
about
five
years
when
during
a
ride
on
the
q
train
one
day
in
she
noticed
a
pain
in
her
back
berman
is
a
registered
nurse
and
at
first
she
thought
it
was
a
fracture
the
cancer
had
already
metastasized
to
her
bones
she
knew
making
them
more
susceptible
to
breakage
but
x-rays
and
testing
revealed
a
different
problem
the
metastasis
had
reached
the
center
of
her
spine
causing
pain
that
would
soon
get
worse
berman's
oncologist
recommended
the
standard
course
of
radiation
therapy
with
multiple
doses
although
it
would
likely
turn
off
the
pain
she
learned
it
would
also
cause
weeks
of
severe
side
effects
including
nausea
loss
of
appetite
skin
burning
and
fatigue
at
that
point
berman
consulted
a
palliative
care
specialist
which
is
something
relatively
few
patients
in
her
situation
do
because
they
don't
know
the
option
exists
their
insurance
won't
pay
for
it
or
they
can't
find
a
provider
for
berman
it
made
a
big
difference
palliative
care
focuses
on
the
management
of
pain
and
symptoms
as
well
as
the
quality
of
life
rather
than
trying
to
treat
the
disease
itself
ideally
palliative
care
involves
a
team
of
doctors
nurses
and
social
workers
all
of
whom
work
together
and
in
coordination
with
the
patients
and
their
families
in
this
case
the
palliative
specialist
proposed
an
alternative
a
one-time
larger
dose
of
similarly
targeted
radiation
that
canadian
doctors
had
found
equally
effective
with
far
fewer
side
effects
her
oncologist
in
new
york
agreed
to
try
it
and
the
treatment
worked
even
better
than
expected
nausea
fatigue
skin
damage
berman
had
none
of
those
problems
i'm
peaches
and
cream
with
blue
eyes
so
if
anybody
is
going
to
see
a
radiation
burn
it's
me
berman
who
is
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
huffpost
but
i
had
no
redness
it
wasn't
even
pink
the
very
next
day
berman
was
on
the
acela
train
from
her
home
in
new
york
to
washington
d.c.
for
a
work
trip
she
had
planned
weeks
before
i
felt
great
she
said
berman's
experience
is
a
case
study
in
the
ability
of
palliative
care
to
transform
the
lives
of
people
with
serious
life-threatening
conditions
and
although
many
people
think
of
palliative
care
as
synonymous
with
hospice
care
which
is
for
the
end
of
life
berman's
story
shows
why
it
is
not
simply
or
even
mostly
for
people
whose
diseases
have
run
their
courses
and
who
face
imminent
death
palliative
care
is
also
for
people
who
would
still
benefit
from
disease-altering
and
curative
treatments
as
well
as
people
living
with
chronic
conditions
like
parkinson's
congestive
heart
failure
or
dementia
and
it
appears
to
work
really
well
with
clear
well-documented
benefits
both
for
individual
patients
and
for
society
people
who
get
palliative
care
are
more
likely
to
stay
productive
whether
at
work
or
at
home
and
they
are
less
likely
to
end
up
in
the
emergency
room
that
can
show
up
as
tangible
quantifiable
savings
for
whoever
is
paying
medical
bills
in
one
peer-reviewed
study
researchers
found
savings
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
month
producing
a
positive
return
on
investment
of
to
numbers
like
that
help
explain
why
interest
in
palliative
care
has
exploded
in
the
last
few
decades
today
roughly
of
u.s.
hospitals
have
a
palliative
care
program
in
less
than
did
but
even
that
rapid
growth
isn't
keeping
up
with
the
demand
especially
with
a
population
that
is
both
getting
older
and
thanks
to
more
advanced
treatments
increasingly
living
for
many
years
with
debilitating
or
terminal
conditions
palliative
care
is
more
difficult
to
find
outside
of
hospital
settings
even
though
one
of
its
main
goals
is
to
help
patients
living
at
home
and
to
keep
them
away
from
emergency
rooms
it
is
also
less
available
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
particularly
the
south
as
many
as
million
americans
live
in
places
with
limited
or
no
palliative
care
options
outside
of
hospitals
according
to
a
study
making
palliative
care
more
widely
available
is
among
the
bigger
challenges
facing
the
u.s.
health
care
system
today
it
requires
more
commitment
from
care
providers
and
policymakers
including
the
ones
in
washington
palliative
comes
from
the
latin
word
palliare
to
cloak
and
in
some
respects
palliative
care
harks
back
to
medicine's
pre-technological
origins
when
healers
weren't
actually
that
good
at
healing
unable
to
cure
they
had
to
focus
on
comfort
development
of
anesthesia
sterile
surgical
techniques
and
antibiotics
changed
all
of
that
so
medicine
was
able
to
treat
illness
and
injury
more
successfully
but
in
the
process
medical
professionals
started
paying
less
attention
to
pain
management
and
other
quality-of-life
issues
among
the
pioneers
who
pushed
back
against
that
trend
was
a
canadian
physician
balfour
mount
in
he
created
a
palliative
care
service
at
a
montreal
hospital
modeled
in
part
on
what
he'd
seen
in
hospice
care
in
order
to
alleviate
the
physical
and
emotional
trauma
of
cancer
patients
there
the
name
stuck
and
in
the
world
health
organization
recognized
palliative
care
as
a
separate
medical
specialty
since
then
palliative
care
has
attracted
interest
and
investment
from
a
variety
of
independent
sources
including
philanthropies
such
as
the
john
a.
hartford
foundation
where
berman
is
a
senior
program
officer
the
foundation
focuses
on
care
for
older
adults
she
had
been
working
there
even
before
the
cancer
diagnosis
employers
and
private
insurers
increasingly
include
palliative
care
as
part
of
their
health
benefits
while
the
u.s.
medical
establishment
now
includes
organizations
like
the
american
academy
of
hospice
and
palliative
medicine
which
represents
doctors
nurses
and
other
professionals
who
are
part
of
palliative
care
teams
but
even
now
many
of
the
people
who
would
benefit
from
palliative
care
don't
get
it
one
reason
is
the
common
misperception
that
palliative
care
is
only
for
the
end
of
life
a
notion
that
insurers
can
reinforce
by
the
way
they
structure
benefits
medicare
is
a
perfect
example
its
hospice
benefit
will
pay
for
precisely
the
sort
of
team-oriented
approach
that
is
ideal
for
palliative
care
but
to
get
the
benefit
medicare
beneficiaries
must
first
relinquish
their
right
to
further
disease
treatment
it
is
literally
an
either
or
paper
you
sign
diane
meier
director
of
the
center
to
advance
palliative
care
told
huffpost
it's
like
signing
your
own
death
certificate
and
nobody
wants
to
do
that
my
colleagues
call
it
the
terrible
choice
families
parents
and
clinicians
do
not
like
to
self-label
as
dying
she
explained
the
either-or
concept
keeps
people
away
from
the
care
they
need
and
drives
them
to
the
only
place
that
has
to
take
them
in
a
crisis
emergency
department
hospital
