want

is
unprecedented

not
the
time

a
no-deal
brexit
on

country
what
we

asking

today
to
do
is
to
rule
out
playing
russian
roulette
with
this
country's
future
corbyn
said
with
our
industry
with
out
national
health
service
and
with
people's
jobs
and
livelihoods
all
at
stake

their
trying
to
retain
power

added
if
we
don't
act
today
we
may
not
get
another
chance
whether
people
voted
leave
or
remain
they
did
not
vote
to
shut
down
democracy
