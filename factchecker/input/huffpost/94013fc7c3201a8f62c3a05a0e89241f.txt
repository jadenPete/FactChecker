san

mounting
friction
over
the
need
for
a
single-issue
debate
on
climate
change
was
the
elephant
in
the
room
friday
as
the
democratic
national
committee
convened
for
the
second
day
of
its
annual
summer
meeting
friday's
event
in
downtown
san
francisco
which
was
largely
dedicated
to
short
speeches
from
of
the
candidates
came
a
day
after
the
dnc's
resolutions
committee
voted
against
such
a
debate
activists
fed
up
with
the
party's
opposition
to
a
debate
on
climate
which
got
only
minutes
of
airtime
during
last
month's
democratic
debates
flooded
the
room
in
outrage
thursday
tensions
from
that
standoff
lingered
friday
as
delegates
assembled
to
hear
directly
from
the
candidates

a
little
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
climate

delegate
marcus
porter
said
after
the
first
round
of

statements
but
we're
trying
to
stay
positive
he
added
noting
that
a
petition
is
circulating
to
bring
the
proposal
to
the
floor
during
the
full
committee's
general
session
on
saturday
but
even

has
admitted
that
it's

not
sanctioned
by

yesterday
we
were
able
to
have
a
big
victory
with
the

reversing
their
policy
of
sanctioning
candidates
that
participate
on
third-party

at

said
i
think
that
it's

of

having

said
the

emboldened
bigots
xenophobes

for

trump
was
trying

make

meanwhile
warren
who
drew
the
longest
applause
of
any

focused
her
remarks
not
on
trump
racism
or
climate
change
but
rather
on
the

and
the
need
for
big
structural
change
in
the
form
of
a

tax
higher
wages
tuition-free

for

delivering

ahead

had
the

on

as
he
spoke
in
his
booming
voice
about
systemic
racism
and
the

that
sustain
it
climate

issues
he
reminded
the

play
an
integral
role

young

are
right
climate
change
is
a
moral
issue
barber
said
you
can't
talk
about
climate
change
and
not
talk
about
systemic
racism
and
poverty
if
you're
running
