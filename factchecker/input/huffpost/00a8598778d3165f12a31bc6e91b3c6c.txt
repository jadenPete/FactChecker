democratic
judicial
nominees
should
be
progressive
on
economic

as
well
as
civil
liberties
argues
demand
justice
for
decades
democrats
have
insisted
that
liberal
judges
toe
the
line
on
racial
justice
women's
rights
and
other
so-called
social
areas
of
the
law
but
have
been
more
welcoming
to
jurists
with
pro-corporate
records
now
a
leading
progressive
group
is
trying
to
establish
stronger
standards
for
economic
justice
with
professional
criteria
designed
to
screen
out
corporate
lawyers
who
may
be
more
likely
to
side
with
big
business
demand
justice
is
calling
on
democratic
presidential
candidates
to
refuse
to
nominate
to
the
federal
judiciary
including
the
supreme
court
people
who
have
achieved
the
status
of
partner
at
a
corporate
firm
or
worked
as
in-house
counsel
at
a
major
corporation
instead
they
want
democrats
to
look
to
people
with
backgrounds
less
common
on
the
federal
bench
like
public
interest
lawyers
public
defenders
and
labor
lawyers

president

have
reshaped
the
federal
judiciary
liberals
need
a
robust
response
according
to
one
group
the
idea
is
to
emulate
conservative
movements
to
pack
the
courts
with
pro-corporate
judges
but
in
reverse
a
move
that
if
successful
could
stop
and
eventually
reverse
the
judiciary's
rightward
turn
the
survival
of
existing
labor
health
and
environmental
regulations
and
social
programs
to
say
nothing
of
future
efforts
to
expand
on
them
depends
on
a
robust
progressive
counterweight
to
the
conservative
judicial
juggernaut
fallon
argued
all
the
work
that
democratic
candidates
are
doing
to
bring
attention
to
income
inequality
and
the
wealth
gap
in
this
country
you
can't
talk
about
that
stuff
and
propose
policy
solutions
intended
to
address
those
kinds
of
problems
without
having
a
court-focused
strategy
because
anything
that
you
might
seek
to
proactively
do
is
going
to
run
into
the
buzzsaw
of
a
court
that's
rigged
in
favor
of
corporate
interests
fallon
said
we
have
to
grapple
with
that
and
grappling
with
that
means
making
a
choice
to
start
nominating
people
that
represent
the
antithesis
of
that
anything
that
you
might
seek
to
proactively
do
is
going
to
run

will
fund
a

to

its
no

project
it
has
already
hired

its

they
will
add
the

to
the

the

is
part
of
a
larger

to
replicate
the
systemic
and
unyielding
approach
that
movement
conservatives
have
applied
to
reshaping
the
federal
judiciary
in
the
last
few
decades
the
supreme
court
has
worked
for
years
to
reify
corporate
power
and
limit
the
rights
of
workers
activists
and
governments
to
curb
that
power
since
when
john

became
chief
justice
the

of

according
to
an
analysis
by
the
progressive
constitutional
accountability
center
conservative
justices
have
crafted
the
most
high-profile
pro-business
decisions
but
liberal
justices
have
also
often
joined
their
conservative
colleagues
in
siding
with
corporations
for
example
this
past
june
all
four
liberal
justices
joined
with
three
conservative
colleagues
to
strike
down
a
tennessee
rule
restricting
out-of-state
alcohol
sellers
that
is
likely
to
pave
the
way
for
the
explosion
of
national
liquor
store
chains
public
health
advocates
worry
that
by
expanding
the
reach
of
big
alcohol
chains
capable
of
selling
cheaper
booze
it
will
increase
rates
of

abuse

critics

the
economic
left
argue
that
justice
stephen
breyer
a
liberal
on

issues
is
too
accommodating

business
a
major
reason
why
so
many
liberal
justices
have
less
progressive
stances
on
questions
of
corporate
power
and
economic
rights
is
that
they
often
hail
from

federal

clerkships
and
corporate
law
firms
the

for

that

looking

of

the

announcing

fallon

that
some
liberal
jurists
who
have
done
corporate
work
in
the
past
have
proven
to
be
dogged
advocates
of
corporate
accountability
once
on
the
bench
for
example
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
first
person
of
latino
descent
to
serve
on
the
supreme
court
and
a
judge
whose
record
they
approve
of
was
a
partner
at
a
corporate
law
firm
prior
to
ascending
to
the
federal
bench
but
in
general
being
a
corporate
law
partner
is
pretty
consistent
with
having
a
bias
toward
big
business
said
matt

a
fellow

open

institute
who
applauded
demand
justice's
new
push
a
lot
of
clinton
and
obama
judges
are
horrible
he
said
one
of
the
likeliest
objections
to
demand
justice's
campaign
is
that
it
could
conflict
with
efforts
to
elevate
women
people
of
color
and
candidates
from
other
marginalized
groups
to
the
federal

fallon
said
his
group
does
not
see
the
two
goals
as
at
odds
demand
justice
plans
to
release
a
list
of
candidates
it
would
like
a
democratic

the

obama's

for

the
evaluations
demand

is
up
against
a
powerful
network
of
conservatives
who
wield
authority
over
republican
judicial
nominations
at
multiple
points
during
the
political
process
when
trump
clinched
the
gop
presidential
nomination
he
sought
to
assuage
social
conservatives
in
particular
who
were
concerned
by
his
lack
of
ideological
rigor
that
he
would
stick
to
their
preferences
a
number
of
prominent
conservatives
reluctant
to
vote
for

cited
the
fate

explaining
their

to

trump
working
closely
with
mcconnell
has
held
up
his
end
of
the
bargain
seating
conservative
judicial
nominees
some
of
them
woefully
underqualified
with
breakneck
speed
in
just
two

there's

fallon
said
referring
to
their
prioritization
of
the
judiciary
speed
and
creative
tactics
fallon
acknowledged
that
the
next
democratic
president
is
not
likely
to
get
the
chance
to
fill
many
conservative-held
vacancies
and
thus
change
the
balance
of
power
in
the
courts
but
electing
a
democratic
president
committed
to
replacing
retiring
liberal
judges
with
even
stronger
new
candidates
is
an
important
first
step
according
to
fallon
both
for
its
direct
ideological
implications
and
the
awareness
it
can
help
engender
among
activists
one
goal
of
this
conversation
is
to
peel
the
curtain
back
a
little
bit
and
reach
people
that
are
bothered
by
lobbyists
working
in
the
government
bothered
by
the
idea
of
big
wealthy
bundlers
that
have
outsize
influence
over
candidates
and
show
them
that
that
same
sort
of
undue
influence
that
is
being
exerted
by
sort
of
the
monied
class
that
that's
happening
in
this
area
as
well
fallon
said
we
need
to
create
a
sense
of
empowerment
and
a
sense
of
outrage
he
added
that
takes
time
in
itself
