told

to

dangerous
push
for
an

constitutional
amendment
washington
the
leaders
of
major
lgbtq
rights
groups
are
privately
warning
another
national
organization
to
stop
pushing
for
an
lgbtq
constitutional
amendment
ahead
of
the
elections
saying
the
strategy
is
ill-informed
and
a
serious
risk
to
the
work
they
are
already
doing
in
states
and
at
the
federal
level
while
we
certainly
believe
that
the
challenges
facing
the
lgbtq
community
require
bold
action
we
also
believe
that
advancing
an
amendment
campaign
is
a
harmful
approach
to
our
community
reads
an
aug
letter
to
glaad
president
and
ceo
sarah
kate
ellis
signed
by
executives
at
five
lgbtq
and
progressive
advocacy
groups
glaad
is
an
lgbtq
media
advocacy
group
as
some
of
us
discussed
in
a
recent
conversation
with
you
we
have
both
process
and
substance
concerns
the
letter
continues
glaad's
campaign
has
lacked
meaningful
engagement
with
the
broader
movement
representing
the
lgbtq
community
particularly
state
and
national
organizations
that
would
be
responsible
for
doing
the
work
to
pass
such
an
amendment
and
presents
a
serious
risk
to
the
community's
work
at
the
state
and
federal
level
it
concludes
we
ask
that
glaad
not
launch
or
cease
engagement
on
this
campaign
to
talk
with
us
and
key
stakeholders
about
the
campaign
the
letter
obtained
by
huffpost
is
signed
by
james
esseks
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union

center
for
transgender
equality
and
laura
durso
of
the
center
for
american
progress
here's
a
copy
of
the
two-page
letter
it's
unusual
that
prominent
lgbtq
rights
groups
would
team
up
to
chide
one
of
their
own
even
if
privately
but
it's
not
surprising
why
they
are
upset
they're
all
focusing
their
resources
and
advocacy
on
passing
the
equality
act
a
sweeping
bill
in
congress
that
would
amend
civil
rights
laws
to
include
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
as
protected
characteristics
glaad
supports
that
bill
too
but
it
is
also
trying
to
get
people
buzzing
about
the
idea
of
amending
the
constitution
to
include
explicit
protections
for
lgbtq
people
women
people
of
color
and
people
with
disabilities
it's
not
a
glaad
campaign
per
se
the
organization
is
a
partner
in
the
era
coalition
which
includes
a
number
of
progressive
groups
advocating
for
a
fully
inclusive
equal
rights
amendment
to
the
constitution
but
glaad
is
certainly
active
in
the
cause
ellis
wrote
a
june
op-ed
in
the
advocate
urging
lgbtq
groups
to
focus
on
passing
a
fully
inclusive
equal
rights
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
new
york
times
ran
a
june
profile
of
ellis
centered
on
her
efforts
to
build
support
for
a
constitutional
amendment
last
month
glaad
put
out
a
tip
sheet
on
the
amendment
for
journalists
covering
the
election
there
just
appears
to
be
a
fundamental
disagreement
in
strategy
between
the
groups
glaad
sees
merit
in
advocating
for
a
moonshot
the
human
rights
campaign
and
other
national
lgbtq
groups
think
that's
a
waste
of
time
and
want
everyone
putting
their
resources
toward
a
shared
more
realistic
goal
in
the
meantime
the
trump
administration
is
plowing
ahead
with
its
assault
on
lgbtq
rights
most
recently
the
justice
department
argued
in
federal
court
that
people
should
be
able
to
be
fired
from
their
jobs
for
being
gay
lesbian
bisexual
or
transgender
in
a
lengthy
statement
to
huffpost
glaad
defended
its
role
in
the
era
coalition
and
emphasized
it
isn't
prioritizing
an
inclusive
era
over
the
equality
act
interestingly
the
group
says
it
does
not
have
plans
for
public
pushes
around
the
inclusive
era
glaad
fully
embraces
the
equality
act
and
is
also
willing
to
consider
any
option
that
protects
lgbtq
people
from
the
rampant
discrimination
that
exists
especially
at
a
time
when
the
supreme
court
and
federal
court
system
are
growing
more
anti-lgbtq
by
the
day
the
expanded
equal
rights
amendment
would
provide
explicit
protections
in
the
u.s.
constitution
for
women
people
of
color
lgbtq
people
and
those
with
disabilities
glaad
became
the
first
major
lgbtq
organization
to
formally
support
this
intersectional
approach
to
equality
one
that
cannot
be
taken
away
or
debated
glaad
recognizes
that
the
vision
is
bold
and
other
progressive
experts
are
evaluating
a
future
legislative
roadmap
receiving
this
letter
was
surprising
given
that
glaad
requested
to
speak
with
the
organizations
on
the
letter
about
the
inclusive
era
multiple
times
over
the
last
year
and
since
we
learned
more
about
it
given
today's
divisive
cultural
and
political
landscape
glaad
does
not
have
plans
for
public
pushes
around
the
inclusive
era
for
more
than
a
year
glaad
has
been
conducting
proper
due
diligence
including
meetings
with
progressive
leaders
policy
experts
and
elected
officials
who
are
interested
in
continuing
to
explore
the
inclusive
era
we
see
validity
in
a
number
of
points
in
the
letter
and
look
forward
to
continuing
dialogue
with
those
on
the
letter
as
well
as
other
social
justice
leaders
about
ways
to
stand
united
against
the
growing
discrimination
that
marginalized
communities
face
today
glaad
spokesman
rich
ferraro
said
the
organization
has
been
reaching
out
to
the
lgbtq
rights
groups
on
the
letter
since
june
to
talk
about
the
importance
of
pushing
for
an
inclusive
era
but
almost
all
of
its
outreach
attempts
went
unanswered
ellis
responded
to
the
groups
latest
letter
on
monday
and
requested
that
they
all
talk
immediately
we
as
leaders
of
the
lgbtq
movement
need
to
urgently
discuss
how
to
best
address
the
growing
visibility
of
an
inclusive
equal
rights
amendment
reads
an
excerpt
of
her
letter
but
the
groups
denied
ellis
request
for
a
monday
night
call
because
she
wanted
other
progressive
groups
in
the
era
coalition
to
participate
in
the
call
we
wanted
to
bring
other
voices
from
the
progressive
world
that
are
not
lgbtq
groups
said
ferraro
to
be
sure
it
is
incredibly
difficult
to
amend
the
constitution
and
for
lgbtq
advocacy
groups
with
limited
budgets
and
bandwidth
it's
not
the
most
pragmatic
goal
both
chambers
of
congress
have
to
pass
a
resolution
with
a
two-thirds
majority
vote
and
the
resolution
must
be
ratified
by
three-fourths
of
the
states
either
through
a
state
legislature
or
a
state
constitutional
convention
the
process
can
also
be
harmful
say
the
lgbtq
groups
on
the
letter
because
constitutional
conventions
open
the
door
to
groups
hostile
to
civil
rights
to
propose
other
amendments
any
effort
to
amend
the
u.s.
constitution
would
require
significant
diversion
of
resources
funds
and
energy
at
a
time
when
our
community
is
facing
immediate
and
dangerous
attacks
at
all
levels
of
government
they
said
additionally
it
would
provide
a
convenient
out
for
those
members
of
congress
and
state
legislatures
who
would
like
to
avoid
supporting
the
equality
act
ferraro
responded
that
no
one
is
calling
for
a
constitutional
convention
and
it
has
never
been
a
part
of
any
discussion
that
glaad
has
been
part
of
any
effort
to
amend
the
u.s.
constitution
would
require
significant
diversion
of
resources
funds
and
energy
at
a
time
when
our
community
is
facing
immediate
and
dangerous
attacks
at
all
levels
of
government
lgbtq
rights
groups
to
glaad
one
lgbtq
rights
advocate
who
requested
anonymity
in
order
to
speak
candidly
said
the
letter
to
glaad
was
the
culmination
of
many
months
of
frustration
with
the
organization
for
ignoring
lgbtq
rights
groups
requests
to
drop
its
push
for
a
constitutional
amendment
and
get
on
the
same
page
with
them
multiple
groups
had
repeatedly
expressed
concern
but
glaad
continued
to
move
forward
said
this
advocate
so
groups
across
the
movement
decided
to
outline
those
concerns
in
writing
huffpost
reached
out
to
all
of
the
letter's
signatories
for
comment
only
one
winterhof
the
senior
vice
president
for
policy
and
political
affairs
at
the
human
rights
campaign
responded
she
made
it
pretty
clear
that
her
organization
isn't
interested
in
focusing
on
a
constitutional
amendment
we
are
supportive
of
bold
and
achievable
strategies
to
advance
full
federal
equality
now
not
into
the
future
which
is
why
we
are
laser
focused
on
passing
the
equality
act
winterhof
said
today
in
many
states
lgbtq
people
could
be
fired
from
their
jobs
kicked
out
of
their
homes
and
refused
lifesaving
services
simply
because
of
who
they
are
this
is
wrong
and
demands
urgent
action
the
equality
act
is
that
solution
and
is
supported
by
more
than
businesses
overwhelming
majorities
of
americans
and
the
bipartisan
majority
in
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
that
recently
passed
this
critical
bill
she
added
that
is
why
the
lgbtq
movement
along
with
the
broader
civil
rights
community
is
committed
to
working
with
a
senate
that
is
pro-equality
and
president
who
is
pro-equality
to
pass
this
legislation
as
soon
as
possible
related
coverage
equality

faces
lack
of
gop
