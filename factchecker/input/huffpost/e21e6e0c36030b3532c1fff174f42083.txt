maine
poised
to
be
first
state
to
use
ranked
choice
voting
in
a
presidential
election
the
process
which
allows
voters
to
rank
multiple
candidates
will
be
in
effect
for
the
general
election
but
not
the
primary
maine
will
be
the
first
state
in
the
country
to
use
ranked
choice
voting
to
choose
a
president
the
state's
governor
announced
friday
under
the
new
system
voters
will
rank
their
choices
for
president
in
the
general
election
instead
of
choosing
just
one
if
there
are
more
than
two
candidates
on
the
ballot
if
no
candidate
gets
a
majority
of
the
vote
the
candidate
with
the
fewest
first-place
votes
gets
eliminated
the
second
choice
votes
of
everyone
who
voted
for
the
eliminated
candidate
then
get
distributed
to
those
remaining
the
process
continues
until
a
candidate
gets
a
majority
of
the
vote
advocates
for
the
system
which
is
already
used
in
some
maine
elections
and
in
other
localities
across
the
country
say
it
reduces
partisanship
and
gives
voters
more
power
with
their
vote
politicians
have
to
go
out
and
make
their
case
to
a
wider
swath
of
the
electorate
voters
also
get
more
power
advocates
say
because
they
aren't
restricted
to
choosing
just
one
candidate
maine
lawmakers
approved
a
bill
allowing
ranked
choice
voting
in
the
presidential
primaries
and
general
elections
in
late
august
gov
janet
mills
d
said
friday
she
would
allow
the
bill
to
become
law
without
her
signature
mills
said
she
was
making
that
decision
in
order
to
allow
lawmakers
to
work
out
funding
and
technical
details
next
year
but
the
delay
also
means
that
the
law
won't
go
into
effect
until
after
the
state's
march
presidential
primary
when
there
are
likely
to
be
many
candidates
on
the
ballot
it
will
be
in
effect
however
for
future
presidential
primaries
in
the
state
my
experience
with
ranked-choice
voting
is
that
it
gives
voters
a
greater
voice
and
it
encourages
civility
among
campaigns
and
candidates
at
a
time
when
such
civility
is
sorely
needed
mills
said
in
a
letter
to
the
legislature
at
the
same
time
there
are
serious
questions
about
the
cost
and
logistics
of
ranked-choice
voting
including
collecting
and
transporting
ballots
from
more
than
towns
in
the
middle
of
winter
mills
decision
to
let
the
measure
become
law
was
historic
said
david
farmer
a
spokesperson
for
the
committee
for
ranked
choice
voting
still
he
said
it
was
disappointing
the
process
wouldn't
be
in
effect
for
the
primary
i
think
the
democratic
primary
right
now
where
we
have
a
large
diverse
field
of
qualified
candidates
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
ranked
choice
voting
is
such
an
important
reform
he
said
with
so
many
good
candidates
in
there
voters
can
select
their
top
choice
without
worrying
about
the
spoiler
effect
or
trying
to
calculate
some
triangle
of
electability
maine
allocates
two
of
its
four
electoral
votes
to
the
winner
of
the
statewide
vote
each
of
the
remaining
two
get
allocated
to
the
candidate
who
gets
the
most
votes
in
each
of
the
state's
two
congressional
districts
the
system
means
maine
election
officials
may
have
to
complete
multiple
ranked
choice
tallies
the
night
of
the
general
election
