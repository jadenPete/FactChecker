the

pack

the
race
for

nomination
shifts
into
a
higher
gear
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
perilous
position
atop
the
vast
field
stands
to
be
tested
under
even
more
pressure
biden
has
consistently
maintained
a
comfortable
lead
over
his
rivals
but
his
campaign
has
been
plagued
by
doubts
over
his
age
fitness
for
office
and
whether
as
a
moderate
he
can
be
a
standard-bearer
for
a
party
that
has
grown
increasingly
liberal
those
questions
are
likely
to
be
magnified
in
the
coming
weeks
labor

donald
trump
in

election
democrats
enter
the
next
phase
of
the
contest
lacking
a
true
consensus
candidate
one
who
can
unite
a
party
fractured
along
ideological
and
generational
lines
while
biden
enjoys
widespread
name
recognition
because
of
his
eight
years
as
barack
obama's
vice
president
and
a
long
senate
career
before
that
he
stands
to
suffer
as
voters
begin
to
focus
on
other
candidates
according
to
strategists
that
may
open
the
door
wider
for
his
closest
competitors
u.s.
senators
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
or
another
rival
to
seize
momentum
biden
is
the
weakest
front-runner
in
a
contested
primary
in
a
long
time
said
democratic
operative
joel
payne
who
worked
on
democratic
presidential
nominee
hillary
clinton's
campaign
and
attributed
biden's
standing
largely
to
voters
familiarity
with
him
rather
than
his
performance
on
the
campaign
trail
the
democratic
field
shrank
a
bit
in
the
past
month
with
u.s.
senator
kirsten
gillibrand
dropping
out
last
week
but
contenders
continue
to
vie
for
the
nomination

democrats
will
square
off

don't
even
know
who
most
of
the
candidates
are
jeff
link
a
longtime
democratic
strategist
in
iowa
likened
the
primary-season
campaign
to
an
american
football
game
and
said
labor
day
marks
the
start
of
second
half
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
the
fourth
quarter
link
said
biden
has
weathered
fierce
attacks
from
his
rivals
and
his
own
penchant
for
misstatements
to
remain
in
front
yet
his
string
of
gaffes
and
episodes
of
faulty
memory
have
sparked
concern
over
his
age
and
his
capacity
to
battle
trump
next
year
if
he
is
the
party's
nominee
biden
is
also
viewed
skeptically
among
some
democrats
who
dismiss
him
as
an
out-of-touch
moderate
in
a
party
moving
leftward
even
so
if
biden
is
able
to
minimize
his
vulnerabilities
it's
still
his
race
to
lose
payne
said
beyond
biden
the
story
of
the
contest's
first
few
months
was
the
rise
of
warren
whose
relentless
campaign
schedule
and
formidable
state-level
organization
have
made
her
a
serious
threat
to
win
the
nomination
she
particularly
has
emerged
as
a
rival
to
biden
in
iowa
a
state
he
desperately
needs
to
win
to
reinforce
his
argument
that
he
is
the
candidate
best
equipped
to
take
down
trump
but
questions
persist
about
warren's
ambitious
liberal
agenda
she
advocates
big
structural
change
and
whether
she
can
attract
moderate
and
black
voters
as
biden
does
skinner
said
warren
can
expand
her
appeal
beyond
siphoning
liberal
voters
from
sanders
and
other
candidates
on
the
left
she
actually
is
starting
to
draw
moderates
she
doesn't
feel
like
a
bernie
sanders
she
doesn't
feel
like
she's
out
to
blow
things
up
skinner
said
i
see
her
as
someone
who
can
draw
supporters
from
bernie
and
from
biden
all
of
the
top-tier
contenders
have
faced
questions
about
whether
they
can
bring
together
a
deeply
divided
party
and
ultimately
defeat
trump
sanders
is
a
self-described
democratic
socialist
who
employs
the
rhetoric
of
a
revolutionary
and
has
seen
his
support
slide
as
compared
to
his
presidential
bid
when
he
gave
clinton
a
tough
fight
for
the
party's
nomination
u.s.
senator
kamala
harris
had
what
appeared
to
be
a
breakout
moment
in
the
first
democratic
debate
in
june
but
has
since
fallen
back
in
the
polls
at
times
she
has
struggled
to
articulate
consistent
policy
stances
pete

indiana
drew
a
flurry
of
press
attention
early
in
his
campaign
but
concerns
persist
about
his
lack
of
national
experience
he
too
has
had
trouble
drawing
support
from

amid
criticism
over

joe

general
election
battleground
state
of
wisconsin
that
trump
narrowly
won
in
said
flawed
candidates
are
the
norm
for
this
stage
of
the
campaign
and
eventually
the
party
will
coalesce
behind
a
nominee
they
all
have
flaws
because
the
process
of
running
for
president
forces
those
flaws
to
the
fore
said
zepecki
who
worked
for
obama's
re-election
campaign
that's
how
we
do
this
while
that
may
be
true
the
enduring
questions
surrounding
biden's
age
and
fitness
for
office
may
mean
democrats
will
lack
the
safe
choice
they
have
had
in
the
past
whether
the
candidate
has
been
former
vice
president
al

in
former

john
kerry
in
or
clinton
the
former
u.s.
senator
and

iowa's

said
the
race
remains
fluid
and
even
a
lower-tier
contender
such
as
u.s.
senator
cory
booker
or
former
u.s.
representative
beto

could
still
make
a
charge
the
objective
for

right
