kellyanne
conway's
husband
lawyer
george
conway
has
accused
president
donald
trump
of
illegally
manipulating
financial
markets
with
his
suspect
claim
that
there
were
numerous
calls
from
high-level
chinese
officials
to
the
u.s.
last
weekend
to
restart
trade
talks
conway
a
conservative
legal
expert
was
reacting
to
numerous
indications
that
the
calls
didn't
happen
and
that
trump
made
up
the
claim
china
has
not
confirmed
that
such
calls
took
place
a
spokesman
for
china's
foreign
ministry
said
after
trump's
announcement
monday
that
he
was
not
aware
of
any
such
calls
cnn
reported
thursday
that
trump
conflated
some
kind
of
communication
with
the
chinese
with
a
statement
at
a
business
forum
in
china
by
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
two
unnamed
officials
told
cnn
that
trump
was
eager
to
project
optimism
that
might
boost
the
markets
world
financial
markets

swooned

previous
week
as
trump
intensified
his
china
trade
war
rhetoric
rebounded
after
the

phone
calls
announcement
conway
said
such
market
manipulation
constitutes
criminal

market
manipulation
occurs
when
someone
artificially
affects
the
supply
or
demand
for
a
security
for
example
causing
stock
prices
to
rise
or
to
fall
dramatically
according
to
a
fact
sheet
from
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
it
can
involve
a
number
of
techniques
to
affect
the
supply
of
or
demand
for
a
stock
including
spreading
false
or
misleading
information
if
trump's
account
of
the
china
calls
was
not
accurate
his
announcement
artificially
boosted
markets
and
people
profited
from
it
it's
not
clear
if
political
information
or
falsehoods
could
be
considered
market
manipulation
trump
has
also
picked
out
companies
like
amazon
to
attack
in
tweets
affecting
stock
values
some
observers
including
nbc
analyst
and
former
huffpost
global
editorial
director
howard
fineman
have
wondered
whether
the
president's
associates
and
relatives
are
profiting
from
advance
knowledge
of
trump's
market-moving
tweets
my
twitter
feed
is
asking
a
legitimate
question
are
realdonaldtrump's
businesses
and
family
profiting
from
insider
knowledge
of
his
pending
market-moving
tweets
comments
and
bargaining
stands
my
guess
would
be
yes
the
real
questions
are
who
is
doing
it
for
him
and
how
howard
fineman
howardfineman
june
the
new
york
times
reported
earlier
this
year
about
trump's
debt-laden
businesses
and
how
he
tried
to
make
money
in
the
market
according
to
the
times
trump
appeared
to
repeatedly
profit
in
the
stock
market
in
the
s
by
presenting
himself
as
a
takeover
threat
by
investing
in
certain
companies
after
reports
of
his
involvement
boosted
stock
values
he
would
then
unload
his
investments
before
others
realized
there
wasn't
going
to
be
deal
and
pocket
the
profit
