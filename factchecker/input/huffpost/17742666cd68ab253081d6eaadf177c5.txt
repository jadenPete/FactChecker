whacks
at
polling
howard

the

latest
survey
which
shows
the

trailing
four
democratic
candidates
in
is
very

in

howard
kurtz
defended
the
network
on
sunday
from
president
donald
trump's
repeated
jabs
at
its
polling
about
which
he
has
griped
incessantly
on
twitter
and
to
reporters
during
his
mediabuzz
broadcast
kurtz
noted
that
trump
had
been
taking
whacks
in
recent
weeks
at
the
outlet's
news
division
with
his
latest
complaint
taking
aim
at
its
survey
showing
the
president
lagging
behind
four
democratic
candidates
based
on
hypothetical
head-to-head
matchups
fox
is
a
lot
different
than
it
used
to
be
i
can
tell
you
that
trump
said
during
a
press
conference
last
week
fox
has
changed
and
my
worst
polls
have
always
been
from
fox
there's
something
going
on
at
fox
i'll
tell
you
right
now
and
i'm
not
happy
with
it
the
day
after
trump's
remarks
one
of
the
channel's
anchors
brett
baier
insisted
that
it
has
not
changed
drawing
a
line
between
the
network's
opinion
and
news
sides
reiterating
the
message
kurtz
reminded
trump
that
the
polls
are
conducted
by
the
news
division
adding
that
its
last
one
is
very
much
in
line
with
other
recent
surveys
now
the
president
who's
criticized
fox's
coverage
of
the
democrats
isn't
always
going
to
be
happy
with
the
journalists
here
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
opinion
hosts
and
that's
fine
he
said
i've
told
the
white
house
that
if
donald
trump
who
i
interviewed
six
times
during
the
campaign
is
ready
to
return
to
mediabuzz
for
a
candid
conservation
about
the
news
business
he
has
an
open
invitation
baier
also
challenged
trump
to
appear
on
his
program
though
the
president
has
not
taken
him
up
on
the
latest
offer
shortly
after
kurtz's
comments
aired
trump
tweeted
that
both
his
show
and
fox
news
are
only
getting
worse
lamenting
that
the
network
had
hired
former
democratic
national
committee
chair
donna
brazile
as
a
commentator
rasmussen

in

kurtz
again
doubled
down
on
his
defense
of
fox
news
stating
that
it
has
made
every
effort
to
be
fair
to
a
potus
much
maligned
by
the

pointing
out
that
he

realdonaldtrump
just
tweeted
that

i
happen

despite
fox

often
favorable
coverage
of
the
president
which
gives
prime-time
slots
to
fawning
opinon
hosts
like
sean
hannity
and
tucker
carlson
trump
has
grown
increasingly
critical
of
the
network
as
of
late
frustrated
not
only
by
its
polling
but
also
its
coverage
of
democratic
candidates
last
month
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
raised
concerns
over
trump's
scrutiny
of
the
outlet
calling
him
thin-skinned
and
suggesting
that
his
behavior
is
that
of
a
dictator
rather
than
a
president
when
president
trump
can
even
attack
fox
news
because
once
in
a
blue
moon
it
says
something
he
doesn't
like
that
shows
that
he
doesn't
really
deserve
to
be
president
because
a
president
must
protect
our
liberties
whether
he's
under
fire
or
not
