colorado

a

daily

celebrating
the
growing

for
an
initiative
to
export
colorado

what

us
locally
will
translate
into
geopolitical

for

and
the

the
column
says
but
while
those
words
were
attributed
to
scott
and
pugliese
they
were
actually
the
work
of
the

a

emails
huffpost

show
that
while
the
colorado
officials
wrote
a
first
draft
of
the
piece
cea
heavily
revised
it
before
publication
that
line
is
one
of
many
additions
cea
made
to
the
column
and
the
emails
show
the
inner
workings
of
a
larger
campaign
to
win
local
support
for
a
major
liquified

the

it

the

the

state
regulators
in

argue
ferc's
analysis
is
riddled
with
errors
and
information
gaps
and
underestimates
the
true
environmental
impact
of
the

the

local

in

wyoming
that
jordan

key

their

markets
the
organization's
behind-the-scenes
effort
to
boost
support
in
the
rockies
has
included
not
just
help
writing
op-eds
but
also
distributing
boilerplate

that
more
than
a

state
