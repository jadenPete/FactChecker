every
trump
reaction
to
a
hurricane
has
been
a
category
disaster
does
he
even
know
what
a
hurricane
is
i
have
a
natural
instinct
for
science
president
donald
trump
oct
natural
disasters
are
big
moments
for
presidents
hopefully
they'll
rise
to
the
occasion
and
take
care
of
the
recovery
and
they
won't
become
infamous
because
it
all
went
fine
or
they
might
be
like
president
george
w.
bush
after
hurricane
katrina
and
be
remembered
for
looking
down
on
the
devastation
from
the
comfort
of
air
force
one
as
his
administration
dithered
and
people
died
and
then
there's
donald
trump
no
president
seems
to
have
less
of
a
grasp
on
what
a
hurricane
is
than
the
current
occupant
of
the
white
house
don't
trust
this
man
to
give
solid
advice
about
hurricane
evacuation
preparation
or
general
weather
patterns
on
sunday
trump
tweeted
that
alabama
was
in
the
path
of
hurricane
dorian
that's
not
true
alabama
was
never
at
risk
but
rather
than
admit
the
president
was
wrong
someone
in
administration
appeared
to
have
retroactively
doctored
a
photo
below
of
an
aug
map
of
dorian's
path
by
drawing
in
a
circle
that
encompasses
alabama
trump
used
that
inaccurate
image
when
talking
about
the
storm
on
wednesday
trump
refused
to
say
whether
that
map
was
altered
with
a
sharpie
telling
a
reporter
afterward
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
trump's
reactions
to
hurricanes
have
always
basically
been
like
this
at
times
weird
head-scratching
and
even
heartless
some
highlights
hurricanes
form
over
the
water
therefore
it's
not
surprising
that
they
are
wet
anyone
in
the
path
of
a
hurricane
or
anyone
at
all
really
knows
that
hurricanes
involve
water
and
wind
but
it's
something
that
trump
thinks
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
public
last
year
he
called
hurricane
florence
tremendously
big
and
tremendously
wet
and
also
said
it
was
one
of
the
wettest
we've
ever
seen
from
the
standpoint
of
water
in
october
after
hurricane
maria
hit
puerto
rico
trump
visited
the
island
and
met
with
storm
victims
telling
a
couple
we're
going
to
help
you
out
have
a
good
time
on
sunday
trump
said
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
ever
even
heard
of
a
category
although
he
added
that
he
knew
it
existed
four
category
storms
have
threatened
the
united
states
during
his
presidency
he
has
also
repeatedly
claimed
that
he
had
never
heard
of
a
storm
of
that
magnitude
in
what
the
pool
reporter
described
as
the
president
doing
his
best
steph
curry
impersonation
trump
threw
paper
towels
to
a
crowd
of
hurricane
maria
survivors
in
puerto
rico
in
october
the
moment
was
widely
viewed
as
emblematic
of
trump's
struggle
to
show
empathy
last
year
when
touring
north
carolina
to
inspect
the
damage
wrought
by
hurricane
florence
trump
met
a
man
whose
house
had
been
badly
damaged
when
trump
went
to
inspect
the
property
he
saw
a
large
yacht
that
had
washed
ashore
and
was
now
shipwrecked
there
he
asked
the
man
if
it
was
his
boat
the
man
said
no
trump
then
smiled
and
joked
at
least
you
got
a
nice
boat
out
of
the
deal
last
year
trump
held
a
call
with
officials
at
the
federal
level
and
in
texas
to
prepare
for
hurricane
season
thanking
the
coast
guard
for
the
work
they
did
in
the
previous
year
with
hurricane
harvey
they
saved
people
many
of
them
in
texas
for
whatever
reason
that
is
trump
said
people
went
out
in
their
boats
to
watch
the
hurricane
that
didn't
work
out
too
well
no
one
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
at
every
chance
he
gets
trump
likes
to
praise
himself
for
the
job
he's
done
rather
than
focus
on
the
victims
who
have
lost
their
homes
other
property
or
loved
ones
in
the
storms
in
october
when
puerto
rico's
governor
said
the
death
toll
from
hurricne
maria
was
trump
said
they
should
be
proud
of
that
number
and
suggested
it
wasn't
a
real
catastrophe
like
katrina
that
was
about
two
weeks
after
the
storm
hit
a
study
put
out
later
by
george
washington
university
researchers
estimated
that
about
people
died
from
the
hurricane
trump's
response
to
that
number
has
been
to
say
no
way
and
insist
that
democrats
were
behind
the
higher
number
in
an
attempt
to
make
him
look
bad
