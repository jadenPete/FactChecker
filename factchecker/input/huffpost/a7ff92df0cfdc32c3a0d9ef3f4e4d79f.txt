and
country

in
we
have

defeat
president
trump
flip
the
senate
and
elect
women
up
and
down
the

she
added
gillibrand
framed
her
campaign
as
a
fight
for
a
return
to
america's
values
publicizing
her
consistent
anti-trump
record
and
her
past
political
advocacy
and
legislation

institutional
racism
is
real
it
doesn't
take
away
your
pain
or
suffering
it's
just
a
different
issue
she
told
an
audience
member
who
had
asked
about
so-called
white
privilege
but
gillibrand
struggled
to
gain
traction
it
took
until
june
for
her
to
announce
she
had
enough
donors
to
meet
the
donor
threshold
to
ensure
a
spot
on
the
democratic
debate
stage
in
early
june
she
hinted
she'd
be
willing
to
support
another
democratic
candidate
if
they
had
a
better
chance
of
defeating
president
donald
trump
i
think
it's
important
that
one
of
us
survives
because
it's
really
important
that
our
nominee
is
absolutely
impenetrable
she
said
at
an
event
in
early
june
according
to
huffpost's
emma
gray
i
want
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
strongest
most
