donald
hump
doesn't
win
reelection
in
freudian
slip
the
former
vice
president
made
the
gaffe
while
campaigning
for
the
democratic
nomination
in
new
hampshire
former
vice
president
joe
biden
had
a
freudian
slip
saturday
when
he
bungled
the
pronunciation
of
the
president
donald
trump's
last
name
in
truly
bidenesque
fashion
the
foot-in-mouth
moment
occurred
during
the
new
hampshire
democratic
party
convention
in
manchester
where
the
hopeful
made
an
impassioned
speech
against
trump's
bid
for
a
second
term
we
cannot
and
i
will
not
let
this
man
be
reelected
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
he
declared
limited
to
four
years
i
believe
history
will
look
back
at
this
presidency
as
an
aberrant
moment
in
time
stumbling
through
his
next
sentence
biden
called
the
president
donald
hump
quickly
correcting
himself
and
dismissing
it
as
a
freudian
slip
if
donald
trump
is
reelected
he
will
forever
and
fundamentally
alter
the
character
of
this
nation
he
eventually
said
the
democratic
front-runner
and
self-proclaimed
gaffe
machine
is
widely
known
for
his
routine
blunders
jokingly
telling
his
supporters
in
the
state
last
month
that
he
wasn't
going
nuts
when
he
temporarily
forgot
the
location
of
his
recent
dartmouth
college
speech
the
day
before
he
made
another
slip-up
when
a
reporter
asked
him
for
his
impression
of
the
new
hampshire
city
of
keene
which
biden
accidentally
said
was
in
vermont
but
some
of
his
mistakes
haven't
been
as
easily
forgotten
less
than
two
weeks
ago
the
washington
post
reported
that
he
had
exaggerated
and
jumbled
key
elements
of
an
afghanistan
war
story
told
while
campaigning
getting
almost
every
detail
wrong
according
to
the
paper
waving
away
criticism
over
his
tenuous
grasp
of
the
facts
biden
argued
in
a
interview
with
npr's
politics
podcast
that
aired
tuesday
that
the
details
are
irrelevant
in
terms
of
decision-making
