republicans
want
to
elect
more

just
not
fewer

the

is
exactly
who
the
republican

says
it's
looking
for

running
for

are
eager

snatch

professional
and
a
mother
of
three
in
a
wealthy
white
suburb
where
a
lot
of
swing
voters
share
her

background
the
kind
of
woman
republicans
say
they
are
desperate
to
recruit
to
speak
to
the
voters
they
are
desperate
to
win
back
but
when
becchi
met
with
a
party
official
at
national
republican
congressional
committee
headquarters
in
washington
he
asked
her
not
to
run
nrcc
officials
already
preferred
another
republican
in
her
new
jersey
district
he
said
tom
kean

the
son
of
that
state's
popular
former
governor
from
the
s
one
of
the
first
things
they
said
to
me
was
why
don't
you
run
in
a
different
district
becchi
fumed
in
a
recent
interview
well
guess
what
i
don't
live
in
another
district
this
is
a
time
when
the
gop
supposedly
wants
more
becchis
in
the
forces
that
made
the
midterms
the
year
of
the
woman
for
the
democrats
spelled
total
catastrophe
for
republicans
white
suburban
women
with
college
degrees
fled
the
party
in
droves
the
bloodletting
left
only
republican
women
in
the
house
a
number
so
low
that
mitch
mcconnell
r
the
senate
majority
leader
and
no
one's
idea
of
an
equality
champion
promised
to
do
a
better
job
of
recruiting
women
candidates
and
getting
them
elected
there's
no
shortage
of
theories
about
what
has
to
change
and
of
big
money
in
search
of
solutions
this
cycle
the
party
is
reportedly
on
track
to
recruit
more
women
than
ever
to
run
for
office
and
a
few
donors
have
poured
millions
into
a
new
super
pac
winning
for
women
which
hopes
to
ferry
those
recruits
through
the
primaries
becchi's
clash
with
the
party
though
cuts
to
a
more
elemental
problem
if
republicans
want
to
elect
more
women
they'll
have
to
elect
fewer
men
to
actually
make
a
difference
said
cam
savage
one
of
a
handful
of
republican
strategists
trying
seriously
to
elect
more
women
people
are
going
to
have
to
go
out
and
steal
some
seats
the
chosen
one
becchi
is
running
in
her
home
district
anyway
where
she's
a
perfectly
plausible
candidate
new
jersey's
th
congressional
district
is
mansionland
with
lots
of
polite
wealthy
white
people
whose
top
political
concerns
include
taxes
and
paying
less
of
them
becchi
is
a
talented
tax
attorney
and
lobbyist
with
an
impressive
list
of
corporate
clients
she
was
also
in
her
long-ago
stint
as
a
senate
policy
staffer
a
co-author
of
the
federal
plan
a
tax-advantaged
college
savings
plan
loved
by
well-to-do
families
like
the
ones
who
live
in
her
district
becchi's
various
personal
causes
boosting
republican
candidates
and
running
an
anti-tax
group
a
trade
association
and
a
variety
of
groups
promoting
republican
women
have
given
her
easy
entree
into
the
regional
republican
elite
but
kean
jr
s
ties
to
those
circles
run
deeper
he's
the
state
senate
minority
leader
he
ran
his
first
race
for
congress
years
ago
he
lost
and
his
personal
driver
on
his
u.s.
senate
campaign
is
now
the
nrcc's
political
director
he
lost
that
race
too
the
party's
steamrolling
of
becchi
has
not
been
subtle
local
republicans
convinced
becchi
to
delay
her
announcement
by
telling
her
she
would
distract
from
this
summer's
legislative
primaries
she
later
spotted
local
officials
attending
kean
jr
s
much
earlier
campaign
kickoff
before
she
could
follow
him
into
the
race
the
nrcc
took
the
unusual
step
of
circulating
poll
results
that
showed
kean
jr
leading
the
sitting
democrat
freshman
rep
tom
malinowski
in
a
general-election
matchup
and
soon
after
becchi
declared
u.s.
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
calif
gave
kean
jr
his
endorsement
it's
a
boys
club
becchi
said
they
say
tom
is
the
person
that's
supposed
to
run
he's
the
chosen
one
mccarthy
wouldn't
speak
directly
about
becchi's
race
in
a
statement
he
said
when
it
comes
to
recruiting
i
don't
want
washington
to
pick
the
candidate
i
want
the
district
to
pick
the
candidate
he
added
i
strongly
believe
we
must
provide
resources
in
support
of
female
candidates
early
and
often
we
cannot
afford
to
wait
until
after
the
primaries
doing
so
will
ensure
our
candidates
a
level
playing
field
to
compete
on
in
the
general
election
in
response
to
a
request
for
comment
the
nrcc
claimed
it
does
not
play
in

becchi
has
her
own

the
rush

she's
a
great
candidate
conway
said
the

has
neither
endorsed

nor
ruled
it
out
her

she
is
a
super
strong

all
those

are

small

republican
insiders

elect
more

elise

and
susan

who
is
retiring
from

recruited
scores
of
women

them
to
run
for

conway
has
matched
nearly
every
woman
who's
running
with
a
republican
woman
in
the
house
or
a
former
member
who
can
act
as
a
kind
of
mentor
but
they
can
only
do
so
much
on
their
own
without
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
party
which
has
shown
time
and
again
that
gender
parity
is
not
its
priority
most
of
their
recruits
have
foundered
in
the
primaries
take

summer

pac
and
all
republican
women
in
the
house
coalesced
around
perry
a
doctor
in
a
special
election
for
an
open
seat
in
north
carolina
perry
received
financial
support
from
just
four
house
republican
men

she
cleared
the

perry
lost

in
the

or
take
carla
nelson
a
minnesota
state
senator
who
ran
for
an
open
house
seat
in
stefanik
recruited
nelson
but
stopped
short
of
supporting
her
candidacy
because
the
party
discourages
house
members
from
influencing
the
primaries
rep
tom
emmer
minn
though
dispatched
his
chief
of
staff
to
minnesota
to
run
her
opponent's
campaign
emmer
is
now
head
of
the
nrcc
a
position
he
obtained
after
mccarthy
asked
a
more
experienced
woman
to
step
aside
he
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
on
primary
day
nelson
got
trounced
i
was
crushed
at
the
loss
for
several
months
nelson
said
the
good
ol
boys
club
still
exists
often
even
the
small
universe
of
people
who
are
serious
about
electing
more
republican
women
finds
itself
divided
that
was
the
case
with
ashley
nickloes
a
self-assured
air
national
guard
pilot
with
multiple
deployments
who
ran
for
an
open
republican-leaning
seat
in
tennessee
the
front-runner
tim
burchett
had
an
extremely
goofy
resume
the
highlights
included
a
bill
to
let
drivers
eat
their
roadkill
but
as
knox
county
mayor
he
monopolized
the
local
donor
class
who
told
nickloes
they
feared
supporting
her
would
bring
his
retribution
nickloes
made
her
case
to
winning
for
women
yes
she
was
a
long
shot
but
she
was
peeling
away
burchett
voters
with
surprising
ease
and
the
knoxville
media
market
was
cheap
winning
for
women
endorsed
nickloes
in
may
but
spent
just
on
a
series
of
online
ads
which
ran
six
days
before
her
primary
to
help
her
what
they
failed
to
see
was
they
really
could
have
made
a
huge
difference
if
they
had
come
in
as
soon
as
i
hit
the
ground
nickloes
said
by
the
time
they
really
did
believe
wow
she's
got
this
she
could
really
do
a
great
job
we
were
way
behind
the
power
curve
she
finished
a
distant
second
none
of
these
women
were
perfect
from
a
party
standpoint
nelson's
opponent
was
dating
the
head
of
the
minnesota
gop
nickloes
deployed
with
the
military
in
the
middle
of
her
race
which
forced
her
to
suspend
her
campaign
becchi
perry
and
nickloes
are
all
first-time
candidates
and
have
diminishing
public
policy
experience
in
that
order
they
reflect
the
fact
that
the
congressional
feeder
system
state
politics
is
dominated
especially
on
the
republican
side
by
men
nationwide
women
occupy
just
of
the
state
legislative
seats
and
of
the
statewide
offices
controlled
by
republicans
the
counterargument
goes
that
republicans
have
to
start
somewhere
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
talk
about
the
need
for
parity
and
how
congress
needs
to
elect
more
women
and
talk
about
the
difficulty
of
doing
it
without
actually
doing
something
about
it
conway
said
in
view
pac
went
all-in
for
women
who
lost
their
primaries
in
districts
where
republicans
went
on
to
win
in
the
general
election
had
anybody
helped
them
conway
said
they'd
be
sitting
in
congress
right
now
conway
and
like-minded
republicans
believe
they
need
to
elect
more
women
for
the
long-term
health
of
the
party
if
we
do
not
attract
more
women
to
run
as
republicans
there
will
be
no
more
republican
party
said
straight
the
new
jersey
republican
who
is
supporting
becchi
the
face
of
the
republican
party
is
mostly
white
males
the
face
of
american
is
not
white
males
one
way
you
reach
out
is
to
have
different
people
carrying
the
banner
said
conway
i
think
we
have
a
really
solid
opportunity
to
pick
up
a
number
of
the
seats
we
lost
with
female
candidates
the
idea
is
that
female
candidates
can
win
back
the
white
educated
women
in
the
suburbs
who
turned
away
from
republicans
in
polls
found
those
voters
switched
loyalties
largely
because
of
their
displeasure
with
president
donald
trump
now
that
trump
has
only
become
more
synonymous
with
the
republican
party

a
cynic
might
say
that
women
present
one
of
the
few
ready
options
for
laundering
the
party's
reputation
the
republican
party
is
generally
on
board
for
the
easy
part
mccarthy
has
donated
to
five
women
from
his
leadership
pac
none
of
them
has
formidable
primary
competition
but
all
of
them
are
running
in
high-stakes
districts
that
democrats
took
from
republicans
in
mccarthy
has
also
introduced
winning
for
women
executives
to
his
deep-pocketed
donors

the
harder
work
the
recruiting
the
