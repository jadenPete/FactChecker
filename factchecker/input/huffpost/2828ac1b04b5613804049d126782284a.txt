the
house
judiciary
committee
is
looking
into
potential
violations
of
the
u.s.
constitution
after
president
donald
trump
floated
the
idea
of
hosting
next
year's
group
of
seven
summit
at
the

doral

and

who
chairs
the
subcommittee
on
the
constitution
civil
rights
and

announced
the
investigation
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
examining
allegations
of
obstruction
of
justice
public
corruption
and
other
abuses
of
power
by
the
president
as
part
of
its
impeachment
investigation
the
congressmen
said
g-
countries
take
turns
hosting
the
summit
and
trump
said
this
week
he
would
likely
select
the
florida
resort
due
to
its
size
and
location
we
haven't
had
anything
that
could
even
come
close
to
competing
with
it
especially
when
you
look
at
the
location
the
president
said
from
this
year's
summit
in
the
french
coastal
town
of
biarritz
using
his
own
property
for
the
international
summit
could
violate
the
constitution's
emoluments
clauses
which
prohibit
federal
officeholders
from
receiving
gifts
or
payments
from
governments
hosting
the
g
summit
at
doral
implicates
both
the
foreign
and
domestic
emoluments
clauses
because
it
would
entail
both
foreign
and
u.s.
government
spending
to
benefit
the
president
the
latter
potentially
including
both
federal
and
state
expenditures
nadler
and
cohen
wrote
they
continued
more
importantly
the
doral
decision
reflects
perhaps
the
first
publicly
known
instance
in
which
foreign
governments
would
be
required
to
pay
president
trump's
private
businesses
in
order
to
conduct
business

a

declined
to

on
the

the

into

is

broader

the
democrats
said
trump
claimed
he
was
not
going
to
make
any
money
off
hosting
the
summit
at
his
own
property
but
as
huffpost
has
previously
reported
the
president
directly
receives
any
money
spent
on
his
properties
including
hotels
and
golf
courses
due
to
the
fact
that
he
is
the
sole
beneficiary
of
a
trust
that
owns
the
trump
organization
his
family
business
trump's
business
has
repeatedly
posed
a
conflict
of
interest
over
the
course
of
his
presidency
a
forbes
report
last
year
found
the
president's
companies
had
charged
million
to
his
reelection
campaign
essentially
turning
donor
funds
into
revenue
for
trump
just

attorney

was
reported
to
have
booked
trump's
hotel
in
washington

for

party
that
a
washington
post
report
said
could
bring
the
business
more
than
in
