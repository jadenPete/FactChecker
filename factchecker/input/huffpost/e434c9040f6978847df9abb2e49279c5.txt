bernie
sanders
unveils
trillion
green
new
deal
to
combat
climate
crisis
the
democratic
candidate's
climate
plan
offers
a
detailed
vision
that
would
expand
public
ownership
of
utilities
and
make
electricity
virtually
free
by
democratic
presidential
hopeful
bernie
sanders
released
a
sweeping
trillion
climate
plan
on
thursday
vowing
to
create
million
jobs
and
completely
zero
out
planet-heating
emissions
by
the
proposal
outlines
easily
the
most
ambitious
vision
for
a
green
new
deal
to
date
with
calls
to
massively
expand
public
ownership
of
everything
from
power
generation
to
groceries
with
washington
gov
jay
inslee
ending
his
climate-centered
bid
for
the
democratic
nomination
a
day
earlier
the
plan
vaults
the
vermont
senator
ahead
of
his
rivals
on
what's
emerging
as
the
defining
policy
issue
of
the
democratic
primary
at
a
moment
when
record
wildfires
are
raging
from
the
amazon
to
the
arctic
and
greenland
is
losing
up
to
billion
tons
of
ice
in
a
single
day
the
plan
is
dense
with
detail
and
frank
in
its
goals
where
other
proposals
including
those
from
inslee
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
depict
expanded
regulatory
regimes
and
public
spending
aimed
at
spurring
private
investment
sanders
charts
out
a
path
to
a
hospitable
global
climate
through
nordic-style
social
democracy
the
scope
of
the
challenge
ahead
of
us
shares
some
similarities
with
the
crisis
faced
by
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
in
the
s
the
plan
states
faced
with
battling
a
world
war
on
two
fronts
both
in
the
east
and
the
west
the
united
states
came
together
and
within
three
short
years
restructured
the
entire
economy
in
order
to
win
the
war
and
defeat
fascism
as
president
bernie
sanders
will
boldly
embrace
the
moral
imperative
of
addressing
the
climate
crisis
the
campaign
declined
a
request
to
interview
sanders
on
wednesday
evening
the
plan
opens
with
sanders
vowing
to
slash
u.s.
emissions
below
levels
by
with
renewable
electricity
and
zero-emissions
vehicles
he
declares
war
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
with
proposed
bans
on
fracking
drilling
on
public
lands
and
all
imports
and
exports
of
oil
and
gas
and
threatens
companies
with
civil
and
criminal
charges
for
pollution
and
obstructing
climate
action
he
pledges
billion
to
help
developing
countries
reduce
their
own
climate
pollution
by
in
the
next
decade
citing
the
nuclear
disasters
in
chernobyl
and
fukushima
sanders
long
a
critic
of
nuclear
power
swears
off
new
reactors
and
promises
a
moratorium
on
future
licenses
to
existing
plants
his
plan
rules
out
geoengineering
the
climate
or
deploying
technologies
to
capture
carbon
dioxide
from
fossil
fuel
plants
which
he
derided
as
false
solutions
it's
unclear
whether
he'd
consider
carbon
capture
technologies
for
difficult-to-decarbonize
industries
like
cement
making

the
plan
which
comes
the
same
week
the

released
its
proposal
to
boost
unions
promises
five
years
of
unemployment
insurance
a
wage
guarantee
housing

job
training
pension
support
and
priority
job

all
workers
displaced

the

it
offers

support
for
those
who
choose
it
or
can
no
longer
work
it
proposes
high
wages
and
union
protections
across
nearly
every
sector
what
stands
out
first
is
sanders
clear
answer
to
the
perennial
question
of
how
to
pay
for
it
there's
the
money
saved
trillion
from
scaling
back
military
spending
on
protecting
global
oil
and
trillion
from
federal
and
state
welfare
due
to
the
creation
of
millions
of
good-paying
unionized
jobs
then
there's
the
money
earned
trillion
from
selling
electricity
produced
by
the
energy
department's
regional
power
marketing
authorities
trillion
from
making
the
fossil
fuel
industry
pay
for
their
pollution
through
litigation
fees
and
taxes
and
eliminating
federal
fossil
fuel
subsidies
trillion
from
income
taxes
on
the
million
new
jobs
the
plan
creates
and
an
additional
trillion
from
forcing
the
wealthy
and
large
corporations
pay
their
fair
share
those
pushing
a
green
new
deal
including
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
and
the
grassroots
group
sunrise
movement
have
shied
away
from
talking
numbers
even
as
republicans
fabricated
a
bogus
trillion
price
tag
instead
advocates
have
pointed
to
the
costs
of
sticking
to
a
business-as-usual
the
sanders
plan
touches
on
that
too
highlighting
that
the
costs
of
catastrophic
warming
could
total
trillion
over
years
this
plan
will
pay
for
itself
over
years
the
policy
memo
reads
experts
have
scored
the
plan
and
its
economic
effects
the
word
document
includes
dollar
signs
sanders
sets
aside
billion
for
regional
economic
development

with
the
lion's
share
over

another
billion

corps
a
new
deal
program
that
planted
billion
trees
in
the
s
gets
billion
righting
the
new
deal's
wrongs
yet
the
plan
aims
to
correct
the
original
new
deal's
racist
legacy
it
envisions
a
beefed
up
office
of
civil
rights
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
vows
to
give
minority
and
women-owned
businesses
cooperatives
and
employee-owned
firms
priority
in
federal
contracts
it
promises
to
adhere
to
the
principles
of
environmental
justice
set
out
at
the
first
national
people
of
color
environmental
leadership
summit
in
and
abide
by
the
united
nations
declaration
on
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
the
plan
calls
for
creating
a
billion
climate
justice
resiliency
fund
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
conduct
a
nationwide
survey
to
identify
areas
with
high
climate
impact
vulnerabilities
and
other
socioeconomic
factors
public
health
challenges
and
environmental
hazards
then
offer
block
grants
in
order
of
most
vulnerable
to
least
vulnerable
the
program
would
establish
a
special
office
of
climate
resiliency
for
people
with
disabilities
to
ensure
that
nationwide
the
needs
of
people
with
disabilities
are
consistently
addressed
during
adaptation
planning
and
that
those
efforts
are
coordinated
throughout
the
federal
government
the
first
two
years
of
this
plan
will
be
spent
very
aggressively
laying
down
a
social
safety
net
to
ensure
that
no
one
is
left
behind
the
proposal
reads
because
this
plan
is
so
comprehensive
in
ensuring
we
solve
the
climate
crisis
we
must
prioritize
establishing
a
social
safety
net
in
the
first
years
of
the
implementation
of
this
plan
water
factors
heavily
into
the
plan
sanders
who
in
february
introduced
the
billion
water
act
to
overhaul
drinking
water
infrastructure
calls
for
its
passage
in
the
plan
as
a
means
of
freeing

spoke
at

rally
at

it's
unclear
how
much
of
the
plan
will
cover
the
american
territories
of
puerto
rico
the
northern
mariana
islands
guam
the
u.s.
virgin
islands
and
american
samoa
but
the
proposal
promises
to
expand
federal
food
stamp
protections
to
all
five
in
an
email
a
sanders
spokesman
said
resiliency
fund
would
provide
significant
funding
to
the
territories
for
a
just
transition
including
real
jobs
resilient
infrastructure
economic
development
not
mine
ours
where
sanders
plan
diverges
most
from
those
of
warren
inslee
and
others
is
in
its
explicit
calls
for
scaling
the
public
sector
in
ways
unseen
since
the
s
power
marketing
administrations
seldom-discussed
agencies
under
the
energy
department
that
operate
transmission
lines
and
sell
electricity
generated
at
federally
owned
hydro
dams
are
central
to
the
plan
the
federal
government
built
four
such
regional
administrations
between
and
sanders
calls
for
building
a
fifth
to
cover
the
states
and
territories
currently
outside
the
other
four's
jurisdiction
he
earmarks
trillion
to
convert
the
entire
operations
to
wind
solar
and
geothermal
and
an
additional
billion
to
build
energy
storage
capacity
the
federal
revenues
from
ratepayers
are
expected
to
fund
the
green
new
deal
but
the
build-out
of
fuel-free
electricity
means
that
per
the
plan
after
electricity
will
be
virtually
free
aside
from
operations
and
maintenance
costs
the
plan
even
offers
billion
in
federal
investments
in
cooperatively
owned
grocery
stores
local
groceries
and
co-ops
are
more
likely
to
buy
local
products
which
will
help
grow
markets
for
farmers
to
sell
their
goods
the
plan
reads
we
will
also
use
these
funds
to
bring
grocery
stores
to
food
deserts
ensuring
all
people
have
access
to
healthy
local
food
harkening
to
the
rural
revitalization
plan
sanders
released
earlier
this
year
the
proposal
makes
a
vague
call
to
incentivize
community
ownership
of
farmland
the
scope
of
the
challenge
ahead
of
us
shares
some
similarities
with
the
crisis
faced
by
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
in
the
s
one
of
the
barriers
to
being
able
to
choose
a
career
in
ecologically
regenerative
farming
is
the
cost
of
acquiring
farmland
it
states
we
want
communities
to
be
able
to
join
together
to
own
farmland
to
help
people
grow
our
local
ecologically
regeneratively
produced
food
and
help
solve
the
climate
crisis
and
will
provide
government
assistance
to
do
so
market
wisdom
it's
easy
to
imagine
the
political
right
smearing
the
proposal
as
a
soviet-style
takeover
by
an
avowed
democratic
socialist
in
reality
the
plan
leans
more
toward
the
first
half
of
sanders
self-professed
ideological
bent
than
the
latter
the
proposal
redirects
subsidies
and
incentives
heaped
on
big
businesses
to
small
ones
it
invests
billion
in
local
food
plants
including
slaughterhouses
and
dairy
processors
rampant
consolidation
in
processing
has
led
to
a
lack
of
facilities
for
small-scale
local
producers
it
reads
investing
in
local
facilities
will
help
smaller
producers
to
compete
with
the
tyson
foods
of
the
world
the
plan
provides
nearly
trillion
in
grants
to
lower-income
families
and
small
businesses
to
trade
in
combustion-engine
vehicles
for
all-electric
alternatives
it
offers
tax
credits
to
businesses
that
hire
workers
transitioning
out
of
fossil
fuel
jobs
nearly
trillion
is
budgeted
for
grants
to
homeowners
and
small
businesses
to
weatherize
buildings
an
additional
billion
goes
to
grants
for
those
same
homeowners
and
businesses
to
replace
gas-fired
appliances
with
electric
alternatives
it
sets
aside
billion
to
pay
farmers
to
store
carbon
dioxide
in
soil
and
transition
to
ecologically
regenerative
agricultural
practices
that
rebuild
rural
communities
protect
the

and

we
need
a

the
courage
the
vision
and
the
record
to
face
down
the
greed
of
fossil
fuel
executives
and
the
billionaire
class
who

in
the
way

the
memo
