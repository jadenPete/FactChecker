north
carolina
gov
roy
cooper
a
democrat
on
wednesday
vetoed
a
bill
that
would
have
required
sheriffs
in
the
state
to
work
closely
with
federal
immigration
officials
seeking
to
identify
undocumented
immigrants
hb
cleared
the
state
senate
in
june
and
the
state
house
of
representatives
passed
the
bill
on
tuesday
among
other
things
the
measure
would
have
directed
authorities
to
determine
the
legal
status
of
anyone
taken
into
custody
for
a
criminal
offense
if
a
prisoner's
citizenship
or
legal
status
could
not
be
determined
authorities
would
be
required
to
tell
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
or
the
department
of
homeland
security
under
the
bill
state
authorities
also
would
have
been
required
to
comply
with
ice
and
dhs
requests
to
interview
prisoners
sheriffs
or
police
officers
who
failed
to
do
so
could
have
been
removed
from
office
cooper
on
wednesday
called
the
legislation
unconstitutional
and
evidence
of
partisan
political
pandering
this
bill
in
addition
to
being
unconstitutional
weakens
law
enforcement
in
north
carolina
by
mandating
sheriffs
to
do
the
job
of
federal
agents
using
local
resources
that
could
hurt
their
ability
to
protect
their
counties

governor
august
cooper's
veto
comes
two
months
after
florida
gov
ron
desantis
a
republican
signed
a
similar
bill
prohibiting
local
governments
from
enacting
sanctuary
polices
and
requiring
state
law
enforcement
agencies
to
comply
with
ice
sanctuary
cities
basically
create
law-free
zones
where
people
can
come
to
our
state
illegally
and
our
country
illegally
commit
criminal
offenses
and
then
just
walk
right
out
the
door
and
continue
to
do
it
desantis
said
at
the
time
in
florida
that
will
not
happen
desantis's
remarks
roughly
echoed
the
sentiments
of
president
donald
trump
and
other
critics
who
say
sanctuary
cities
endanger
public
safety
the
term
sanctuary
city
has
been
defined
in
various
ways
but
generally
refers
to
jurisdictions
that
limit
their
compliance
with
federal
immigration
authorities
in
order
to
foster
trust
between
residents
and
law
enforcement
thus
keeping
communities
safer
some
sanctuary
cities
bar
local
police
officers
from
asking
about
immigration
status
while
others
have
refused
to
turn
over
undocumented
immigrants
being
held
in
local
jails
to
federal
officials
