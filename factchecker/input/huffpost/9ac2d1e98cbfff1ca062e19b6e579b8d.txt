the

post
reported
that
trump's
remarks
represented
the
first
time
that
the
president
had
expressed
regret
over
the
worsening
trade
war
a
clash
that
has
escalated
dramatically
in
recent
days
prompting
fears
of
an
impending
global
recession
but
according
to
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
trump
actually
had
no
regrets
about
the
trade
dispute
and
had
only
responded
in
the
affirmative
because
he
wishes
he
had
slapped
even
higher
tariffs
on
china
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
later
repeated
this
assertion
saying
the
president
did
not
have
second
thoughts
mnuchin
also
denied
the
suggestion
that
he
was
cleaning
up
for

we're

august
grisham's
statement
did
not
mention
trump's
walking
back
of
his
earlier
threat
to
force
u.s.
businesses
to
cut
ties
with
china
trump
told
reporters
on
sunday
that
he
has
no
plans
right
now
to
follow
through
with
this
threat
though
he
stressed
that
he
has
the
right
to
declare
a
national
emergency
if
he
would
want
to
make
it
happen
experts
have
noted
however
that
forcing
american
companies
to
leave
a
foreign
country
is
likely
beyond
the
scope
of
trump's
presidential
authority
trump
adds
that
while
he
can
do
it
he
has
no
plans
to
declare
a
national
emergency
on
china
right
now
says
actually
we're
getting
along
very
well
with
china
right
now
we're
talking
i
think
they
want
to
make
a
deal
much
more
than
i
do

august

disputed
suggestions
that
he'd
faced
pressure
from
other
g-
leaders
to
ease
tariffs
against
china
nobody's
told
me
that
nobody
would
tell
me
that
he
said
according
to
the
guardian
moments
later
however
johnson
who
was
seated
with
trump
contradicted
the
president's
claim
just
to
register
a
faint
sheeplike
note
of
our
view
on
the
trade
war
we're
in
favor
of
trade
peace
on
the
whole
and
dialing
it
down
if
we
can
johnson
said
we
think
that
on
the
whole
the
u.k.
has
profited
massively
in
the
last
years
from
free
trade
and
that's
what
we
want
to
see
we
don't
like
tariffs
