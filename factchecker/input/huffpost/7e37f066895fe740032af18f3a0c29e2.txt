biden
said
at
the
event
co-hosted
by
one
of
the
founders
of
natural
gas
company
western
lng
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
defended
his
decision
to
attend
a
fundraiser
thursday
co-hosted
by
a
founder
of
a
liquefied
natural
gas
company
saying
he
was
still
committed
to
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
pledge
despite
criticisms
from
environmental
groups
i
just
want
to
be
very
clear
to
everyone
here
i
am
committed
to
not
raising
money
from
fossil
fuel
executives
and
i
am
not
doing
that
tonight
biden
told
a
group
of
donors
at
the
event
in
manhattan
on
thursday
evening
according
to
a
pool
report
climate
change
presents
an
existential
threat
and
it
is
real
i'm
so
tired
of
having
a
president
who
picks
fiction
over
science
the
former
vice
president's
comments
came
a
day
after
he
was
asked
by
an
audience
member
during
cnn's
climate
change
town
hall
event
about
his
scheduled
appearance
which
was
first
reported
by
cnbc
and
the
intercept
the
fundraiser
was
co-hosted
by
andrew
goldman
the
co-founder
of
a
houston-based
natural
gas
company
called
western
lng
goldman
no
longer
has
any
day-to-day
responsibilities
at
the
company
but
is
listed
on
western
lng's
leadership
page
he
also
co-founded
an
investment
group
that
funded
projects
related
to
natural
resources
and
energy
in
part
goldman
has
close
ties
to
the
biden
campaign
and
was
an
adviser
to
the
candidate
when
he
was
in
the
senate
what
i
was
told
by
my
staff
is
he
did
not
have
any
responsibility
relating
to
the
company
biden
said
wednesday
when
asked
about
his
ties
to
goldman
he
was
not
on
the
board
he
was
not
involved
at
all
in
the
operation
of
the
company
at
all
but
if
that
turns
out
to
be
true
i
will
not
in
any
way
accept
his
help
we
check
every
single
contribution
biden
signed
the
fossil
fuel
pledge
in
june
promising
not
to
accept
any
campaign
contributions
over
from
pacs
lobbyists
or
fossil
fuel
executives
named
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
the
biden
campaign
aggressively
defended
itself
after
the
question
made
the
rounds
on
social
media
saying
the
characterization
was
factually
incorrect
and
that
he
hadn't
violated
the
pledge
biden's
team
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
his
remarks
thursday
but
as
huffpost's
chris
d'angelo
noted
this
week
the
argument
about
what
constitutes
an
executive
is
largely
semantic
the
sunrise
movement
a
youth-led
coalition
of
environmental
activists
who
helped
garner
support
for
the
green
new
deal
said
biden's
engagement
with
goldman
clearly
violates
the
spirit
of
the
pledge
the
fundraiser
on
thursday
drew
a
small
contingent
of
protesters
who
chanted
no
fossil
fuel
money
and
hey
hey
hey
joe
fracked
gas
has
got
to
go
climate
change
has
become
one
of
the
key
issues
of
the
presidential
race
and
many
of
the
democratic
candidates
have
unveiled
detailed
trillion-dollar
plans
to
address
the
crisis
should
they
unseat
president
donald
trump
biden
initially
faced
criticism
amid
reports
that
he
was
planning
to
unveil
a
middle
ground
approach
to
the
issue
but
responded
with
his
own
policy
based
on
the
green
new
deal
that
would
decarbonize
the
u.s.
economy
by
biden's
plan
only
addresses
fossil
fuels
in
vague
terms
but
he
has
received
a
b
rating
from
greenpeace
and
support
from
action
and
data
for
progress
for
his
stance
on
climate
issues
