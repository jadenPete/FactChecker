richard

bush
has
slammed
vice

mike
pence
for
staying
at
a
hotel
owned
by
president
donald
trump
during
a
visit
to
ireland
this
week
pence
faced
criticism
for
overnighting
at
the
trump
resort
in
doonbeg
a
three-hour
drive
from
where
he
had
meetings
in
dublin
the
vice
president
defended
the
decision
citing
its
proximity
to
his
ancestral
hometown
bush-era
official
painter
however
described
pence's
patronage
of
the
trump
resort
as
outrageous
on
tuesday's
broadcast
of
msnbc's
the
beat
with
ari
melber
the
united
states
government
is
paying
for
that
painter
explained
the
federal
government
is
going
to
make
a
big
outlay
in
order
to
promote
the
trump
hotel
trump
will
make
money
when
secret
service
agents
stay
there
painter
added
our
money
is
being
used
to
promote
his
hotel
this
is
a
violation
of
the
domestic
emoluments
clause
which
caps
the
president's
compensation
for
his
services
at
his
compensations
set
by
congress
he
is
not
entitled
to
milk
the
taxpayer
right
left
and
center
and
that's
what
he's
doing
here
melber
then
aired
footage
from
trump's
first
press
conference
as
president
during
which
he
pledged
to
divest
control
of
his
business
interests
to
his
sons
donald
trump
jr
and
eric
trump
painter
however
argued
trump
was
still
running
the
trump
organization
from
the
oval
office
he's
trying
to
make
the
trump
organization
richer
and
he's
using
his
official
position
as
president
of
the
united
states
to
do
that
painter
said
and
he
is
enriching
himself
in
violation
of
the
constitution
which
restricts
his
compensation
he
has
no
right
to
do
that
with
our
money
