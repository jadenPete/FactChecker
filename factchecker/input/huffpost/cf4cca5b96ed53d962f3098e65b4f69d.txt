trump
ready
to
funnel
yen
euros
and
pounds
into
his
own
pocket
at
next
year's
g-
watchdogs
and
critics
call
his
push
to
have
the
meeting
at
his
golf
resort
in
doral
out-in-the-open
corruption
trump
does
not
appear
to
care
washington
president
donald
trump
has
funneled
hundreds
of
thousands
of
taxpayer
dollars
to
his
own
resorts
since
taking
office
and
now
appears
poised
to
direct
other
countries
taxpayers
yen
euros
and
pounds
into
his
own
pocket
too
with
the
united
states
taking
its
turn
to
host
the
g-
meeting
of
the
largest
democratic
economies
next
year
trump
on
monday
made
it
clear
he
wants
the
site
to
be
his
own
golf
resort
in
doral
florida
with
doral
we
have
a
series
of
magnificent
buildings
we
call
them
bungalows
they
each
hold
from
to
very
luxurious
rooms
with
magnificent
room
views
he
said
at
a
news
conference
at
the
close
of
this
year's
g-
in
biarritz
france
before
adding
the
lie
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
money
that's
just
a
nonsense
statement
said
walter
shaub
with
the
watchdog
group
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
in
washington
shaub
had
run
the
office
of
government
ethics
at
the
start
of
trump's
administration
but
resigned
when
trump
refused
to
follow
his
guidance
on
adhering
to
ethics
laws
he's
the
owner
of
the
thing
it
at
least
creates
the
appearance
of
corruption
associated
press
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
huffpost
queries
about
the
appearance
of
open
corruption
with
the
president
prepared
to
personally
enrich
himself
from
a
government
decision
to
host
a
major
conference
at
his
for-profit
business
once
again
donald
trump
has
demonstrated
that
he
doesn't
understand
the
job
of
being
president
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
just
his
latest
business
acquisition
said
bill
weld
the
former
federal
prosecutor
and
massachusetts
governor
running
against
trump
for
the
republican
presidential
nomination
using
a
serious
meeting
of
world
leaders
to
promote
his
golf
resort
is
just
the
latest
in
many
failures
to
distinguish
between
trump
world
and
the
real
world
no
official
announcement
for
the
site
has
yet
been
made
should
it
wind
up
going
to
doral
shaub
said
it
will
give
the
impression
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
the
united
states
is
no
different
from
other
countries
where
leaders
can
siphon
off
public
money
toward
their
own
benefit
you
would
think
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
want
to
avoid
the
appearance
that
we
have
a
corrupt
system
he
said
calling
on
the
state
department's
inspector
general
to
investigate
how
doral
even
got
this
far
as
a
possible
location
there
are
so
many
places
in
this
country
that
could
host
this
event
that
trump's
hotel
is
even
in
the
mix
is
ridiculous
shaub
said
tax
money
into
trump's
pocket
in
his
most
recent
financial
disclosure
form
filed
this
may
trump
claimed
receiving
in
income
from
the
doral
resort
over
the
previous
year
it's
unclear
how
accurate
that
is
given
trump's
tendency
to
file
widely
varying
figures
to
different
government
authorities
he
told
the
u.s.
office
of
government
ethics
in
his
financial
disclosure
for
example
that
his
scotland
golf
courses
are
worth
more
than
million
each
even
as
he
told
united
kingdom
authorities
that
they
had
a
combined
net
debt
of
million
in
any
case
money
spent
at
trump
hotels
and
golf
courses
flows
directly
to
trump
personally
as
he
is
the
sole
beneficiary
of
a
trust
that
now
owns
his
family
business
because
trump
insists
on
playing
golf
at
his
own
properties
american
taxpayers
have
been
the
source
for
at
least
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
that
have
gone
to
the
trump
organization
in
the
form
of
room
meal
and
other
expenses
for
secret
service
agents
and
other
government
employees
who
have
stayed
on-site
with
trump
in
florida
new
jersey
scotland
and
ireland
should
trump
successfully
land
the
g-
meeting
in
doral
the
multiday
conference
bringing
hundreds
of
both
u.s.
government
as
well
as
foreign
officials
there
would
put
many
millions
of
dollars
into
his
own
cash
registers
at
monday's
news
conference
trump
claimed
almost
certainly
falsely
that
accepting
the
presidency
has
lost
him
money
probably
it'll
cost
me
from
to
billion
to
be
president
he
said
in
reality
trump's
actual
net
worth
and
income
are
not
knowable
to
the
public
because
he
reneged
on
his
campaign
promise
to
release
his
tax
returns
in
doing
so
he
became
the
first
major-party
nominee
since
watergate
to
fail
to
disclose
that
detailed
financial
information
while
trump
put
out
a
press
release
during
the
campaign
claiming
he
was
worth
in
excess
of
ten
billion
dollars
it
is
unclear
whether
he
is
worth
even
billion
in
the
book
trumpnation
business
journalist
timothy
l.
o'brien
wrote
that
trump
was
most
likely
worth
no
more
than
million
not
the
many
billions
of
dollars
he
was
claiming
at
the
time
trump
sued
him
for
defamation
but
lost
and
in
the
process
lied
dozens
of
times
about
his
business
dealings
in
a
deposition
taken
by
o'brien's
lawyers
in
national
journal
found
that
trump
had
made
so
many
poor
business
decisions
over
the
years
that
had
he
simply
taken
the
fortune
his
father
placed
him
in
charge
of
in
and
put
it
into
a
broad
index
fund
he
would
have
been
far
wealthier
than
he
wound
up
mildew
in
trump
world
trump
on
monday
also
described
his
doral
property
in
glowing
terms
as
the
best
suited
for
the
g-
meeting
among
the
dozen
that
are
under
consideration
the
ballrooms
are
among
the
biggest
in
florida
and
the
best
it's
brand
new
he
said
at
the
news
conference
it's
a
great
place
it's
got
tremendous
acreage
many
hundreds
of
acres
he
told
reporters
during
an
earlier
meeting
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
it's
miami
doral
miami
so
it's
a
great
area
while
the
city
of
doral
is
in
miami-dade
county
it
is
removed
from
the
attractions
most
people
have
in
mind
when
they
think
of
miami
the
golf
resort
boasts
plenty
of
ornate
chandeliers
and
baroque
fountains
but
lies
directly
beneath
the
flight
path
of
miami
international
airport's
takeoffs
and
landings
and
is
miles
from
the
closest
beach
during
the
republican
national
committee's
meeting
there
last
spring
the
troubled
property
appeared
to
be
skimping
on
maintenance
costs
at
least
one
of
the
guest
buildings
smelled
of
mildew
as
did
its
guest
rooms
the
restaurant
on
the
lower
floor
in
the
main
lodge
had
a
mustiness
tinged
with
the
fraternity
house
odor
of
spilled
alcohol
its
lap
pool's
water
was
both
over-chlorinated
and
kept
at
too
low
a
level
making
it
unpleasant
to
use
for
its
intended
purpose
shaub
said
he
was
not
aware
of
the
deteriorating
conditions
at
doral
and
had
assumed
that
the
place
was
as
luxurious
and
top-rate
as
trump
continually
claims
we
want
foreign
leaders
to
see
that
he
said
that
makes
it
even
more
ridiculous
