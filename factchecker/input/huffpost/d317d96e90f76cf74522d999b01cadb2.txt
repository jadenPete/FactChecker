in
the
face
of
intense
public
scrutiny
vice
president
mike
pence
has
defended
his
decision
to
stay
at
an
irish
golf
resort
owned
by
president
donald
trump
on
the
dime
of
u.s.
taxpayers
pence
who'd
been
criticized
for
choosing
to
stay
at
the
trump
resort
in
doonbeg
on
monday
despite
its
distance
from
his
official
meetings
in
the
irish
capital
of
dublin
said
in
a
statement
that
he'd
chosen
to
stay
at
the
luxury
property
because
it's
located
near
his
ancestral
hometown
the
vice
president's
family
previously
stayed
at
the
same
resort
in
prior
to
the
trump
organization's
acquisition
of
the
property
and
the
office
was
aware
of
its
proximity
to
the
ancestral
home
where
his
great
grandmother
lived
before
emigrating
to
the
united
states
pence's
office
said
in
a
statement
to
the
new
york
times
staying
in
doonbeg
allowed
for
the
accommodation
of
official
business
and
public
events
on
both
coasts
the
statement
added
noting
that
pence
had
chosen
to
stay
at
the
resort
on
his
own
volition
and
not
at
trump's
prompting
the
vice
president
said
earlier
on
tuesday
that
it
was
logical
for
him
to
stay
at
the
doonbeg
resort
adding
that
it
was
deeply
humbling
for
me
to
be
able
to
come
back
to
ireland
and
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
very
home
town
of
my
mother's
grandmother
earlier
vice
president
mike
pence
is
staying
at
donald
trump's

luxury
golf
course
in
ireland
even
though
he
has
official
meetings
in
dublin
across
the
country
a
three-hour
drive
away
not
to
worry
because
he'll
be
able
to
fly
back
and
forth
on
the
taxpayer's
tab
pence's
stay
made
for
a
bizarre
two-fer
trump
golf
course
phenomenon
on
monday
while
the
president
was
playing
at
his
trump
national
golf
club
in

cawley's
irish-american
wife
hailed
from
doonbeg
according
to
the
irish
times
though
doonbeg
appears
to
be
an
inefficient
and
expensive
location
for
pence's
work
during
his
visit
the
golf
club
stay
serves
the
president
well
not
only
is
federal
money
spent
at
doonbeg
it
gives
the
business
a
high-profile
advertorial
platform
to
attract
customers
critics
on

were
teed
off
about
the
situation

million
in
extra
costs
the
business
posted
promotional
shots
on

website
of

teeing
off
but
yanked
them
after

queries
after
his
trip
to

retweeted
a

organization
advertisement
for
his
