bernie
understands
the
need
for
workers
to
have
a
democratic
independent

that
is
unafraid
to
challenge
corporate

stranglehold

economy
ue
general
president
peter
knowlton
said
in
a
statement
the
ue
endorsed
sanders
at
its
national
convention
in
pittsburgh
and
sanders
accepted
it
in
a
speech
to
the
group
on
monday
in
its
resolution
supporting
him
in
the
crowded
race
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
the
union
cited
sanders
outspoken
support
for
the
ue
members
employed
at
a
locomotive
manufacturing
plant
in
erie
pennsylvania
who
went
on
strike
in
february
over
concessions
demanded
by
their
employer
wabtec
among
other
shows
of
solidarity
sanders
invited
a
representative
of

striking
workers
to
speak
at
the
kickoff
rally
for
his
white
house
bid
in

ue
which
does
not
belong
the
afl-cio
labor
federation
occupies
a
radical
independent
role
in
the
labor
movement
that
parallels
sanders
status
in
congress
the
cio
a
precursor
to
the
afl-cio
expelled
the
ue
and
other
unions
in
over
their
alleged
communist
sympathies
according
to
a
history
on
ue's
website
the
mainstream
labor
movement's
ostracism
contributed
to
the
shrinking
of
ue's
membership
but
allowed
it
to
stick
to
its
left-wing
political
views
and
militant
rank-and-file-driven
approach
to
labor
organizing
for
example
unlike
some
labor
unions
that
have
either
come
out
against
medicare
for
all
single-payer
health
care
or
merely
given
it
lip
service
the
ue
actively
promotes
it
and
featured
it
as
a
key
justification
for
its
endorsement
of
sanders
in
fact
ue's
support
for
sanders
goes
back
to
his
first
victorious
run
for
congress
in
when
he
defeated
both
an
incumbent
republican
congressman
and
a
democratic
challenger
in
remarks
at
the
convention
sanders
said
he
was
humbled
to
receive
the
union's
backing
he
also
hailed
the
wabtech
strike
which
led
the
company
to
compromise
on
some
demands
as
an
example
of
the
kind
of
worker
activism
he
would
like
to
enliven
as
president
ue's
successful
strike
in
erie
has
sent
a
message
to
corporate
ceos
across
the
country
that
it
is
absolutely
unacceptable
for
profitable
corporations
to
provide
obscene
compensation
packages
to
executives
while
ripping
off
workers
and
their
families
he
said
our
fight
is
about
the
need
for
an
economy
that
works
for
all
americans
and
not
just
the
percent
and
we
are
going
to
win
that
fight
together
although
ue
lacks
the
membership
size
of
its
more
establishmentarian
counterparts
in
organized
labor
it
boasts
a
significant
presence
in
the
key
general-election
battleground
state
of
pennsylvania
that
could
help
sanders
make
his
argument
that
he
is
the
candidate
best
equipped
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
in
the
once-democratic
industrial
states
that
propelled
him
to
victory
in
national
labor
unions
which
typically
refer
to
themselves
as
international
thanks
to
their
membership
in
canada
have
been
slower
to
endorse
presidential
candidates
in
the
presidential
primary
field
aside
from
ue's
endorsement
of
sanders
the
international
association
of
fire
fighters
endorsed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
in
april
mere
days
after
he
announced
his
candidacy
some
unions
elicited
criticism
from
their
members
for
backing
the
presidential
candidacy
of
hillary
clinton
early
on
in
the
election
cycle
particularly
from
those
who
supported
sanders
in
his
run
however
sanders
did
pick
up
the
endorsements
of
more
left-leaning
unions
including
ue
the
national
nurses
united
the
communication
workers
of
america
and
the
american
postal
workers
union
notably
nnu
which
operated
a
pro-sanders
super
pac
in
had
already
endorsed
him
by
this
time
in
the
last
election
cycle
this
has
been
updated
with
more
information
about

support
for
sanders
in
