a

said
the

appeared
to
show
a
photo
that
was
provided
during
an
intelligence
briefing
earlier
friday
cnbc
reported
it
was
a
detailed
image
that
labeled
parts
of
the
launch
site
where
the
iranian
rocket
exploded
john
sipher
a
former

told

that
the

ankit

an
adjunct
senior
fellow
at
the
federation
of
american
scientists
who
specializes
in
analyzing
satellite
imagery
said
the
photo
trump
tweeted
was
in
far
higher
definition
than
what's
available
from
commercial
satellites
the
tweet
discloses
some
pretty
amazing
capabilities
that
the
public
simply
wasn't
privy
to
before
this
panda
told
npr
robert
deitz
a
former
lawyer
at
the
cia
and
national
security
agency
told
business
insider
that
trump
made
a
serious
mistake
with
the
tweet
it
identifies
for
the
world
the
methods
we
have
attained
in
collecting
imagery
intelligence
deitz
said
one
doesn't
use
intel
for
the
purposes
of
taunting
the
russians
and
the
chinese
will
be
very
happy
to
study
this
trump's
actions
may
have
blown
the
cover
on
a
multi-decade
campaign

he
noted
ominously
the
propensity
for
saying
the
quiet

out
loud
is
less
amusing
when
it
blows

the

it
was
unclear
what
he
was
complaining
about
it
didn't
appear
that
clapper
had
made
any
public
statement
about
trump's
tweet
being
scolded
by
failed
former

officials
like
james
