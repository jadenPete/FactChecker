joe
biden
says
he
didn't
realize
fundraiser's
ties
to
fossil
fuel
company
ahead
of
cnn's
climate
forum
cnbc
reported
that
biden
is
scheduled
to
attend
the
big
money
event
in
new
york
on
thursday
democratic
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
said
at
cnn's
marathon
forum
on
climate
change
wednesday
night
that
he
was
unaware
that
a
fundraiser
he's
slated
to
attend
on
thursday
is
being
co-hosted
by
a
founder
of
a
fossil
fuel
company
i
didn't
realize
he
does
that
biden
said
referring
to
andrew
goldman
a
co-founder
of
houston-based
natural
gas
company
western
lng
i
was
told
if
you
look
at
the
sec
filings
he's
not
listed
as
one
of
those
executives
biden's
remark
came
in
response
to
an
audience
question
about
reports
published
wednesday
by
cnbc
and
the
intercept
about
biden's
scheduled
appearance
and
his
close
ties
to
goldman
goldman
was
an
adviser
of
biden's
when
he
was
in
the
senate
i
know
that
you
signed
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
pledge
the
audience
member
asked
but
i
have
to
ask
how
can
we
trust
you
to
hold
these
corporations
and
executives
accountable
for
their
crimes
against
humanity
when
we
know
that
tomorrow
you
are
attending
a
high-dollar
fundraiser
hosted
by
andrew
goldman
a
fossil
fuel
executive
he's
not
a
fossil
fuel
executive
biden
shot
back
describing
himself
as
a
candidate
who
has
argued
and
pushed
for
us
suing
those
executives
who
have
engaged
in
pollution
pressed
by
cnn's
anderson
cooper
about
the
fundraising
event
biden
said
i'm
going
to
look
at
what
you
just
told
me
and
find
out
if
that's
accurate
yes
i
think
it's
pretty
accurate
cooper
said
although
he
later
issued
a
clarification
biden's
campaign
pushed
back
at
the
characterization
that
goldman
is
an
executive
of
the
company
symone
sanders
a
senior
adviser
of
biden's
campaign
defended
the
contender
in
a
pair
of
posts
to
twitter
saying
he
hadn't
violated
his
pledge
not
to
take
fossil
fuel
money
the
argument
is
largely
one
of
semantics
western
lng
lists
goldman
as
the
company
co-founder
on
its
leadership
page
goldman
also
co-founded
de
cordova
goldman
capital
management
which
invested
in
natural
resources
and
energy
media
and
telecommunications
and
financial
services
the
sunrise
movement
the
youth-led
climate
group
that
garnered
support
for
a
green
new
deal
called
on
biden
to
cancel
the
fundraiser
saying
it
clearly
violates
the
spirit
of
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
pledge
and
a
spokesman
for
the
environmental
groups
that
oversee
the
pledge
said
the
fundraiser
event
is
sketchy
at
best
let's
be
clear
the
rules
of
the
nofossilfuelmoney
pledge
are
there
to
help
candidates
stay
in
compliance
they
are
not
there
to
help
candidates
weasel
out
of
it
david
turnbull
a
spokesman
for
oil
change
u.s.
tweeted
this
from
joebiden
at
climatetownhall
feels
very
much
like
that
latter
and
that's
not
a
good
look

miller
political
director
of
the
political
action
committee
climate
hawks
vote
and
a
member
of
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
coalition
said
in
a
statement
that
she
is
disappointed
to
see
vice
president
biden
attempting
to
cite
the
technicalities
of
the
pledge
rather
than
simply
comply
with
its
spirit
she
also
urged
him
to
cancel
the
event
at
the
end
of
biden's
time
slot
cooper
clarified
that
goldman
does
not
have
day-to-day
duties
at
western
lng
what
i
was
told
by
my
staff
is
that
he
did
not
have
any
responsibility
relating
to
the
company
he
was
not
on
the
board
he
was
not
involved
at
all
in
the
operation
of
the
company
at
all
biden
said
if
that
turns
out
to
be
true
then
i
will
not
in
any
way
accept
his
help
we
check
every
single
contribution
biden
added
that's
why
we
don't
list
them
immediately
