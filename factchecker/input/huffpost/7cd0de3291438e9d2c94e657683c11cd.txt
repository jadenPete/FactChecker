the
trump
administration
broke
the
law
for
something
good
the
government
shutdown
earlier
this
year
probably
would
have
been
worse
otherwise
the
trump
administration
broke
the
law
earlier
this
year
when
it
decided
to
keep
food
benefits
going
for
millions
of
americans
even
as
parts
of
the
federal
government
were
shut
down
that's
the
conclusion
of
the
government
accountability
office
a
government
watchdog
that
works
for
congress
the
partial
shutdown
lasted
from
late
december
to
late
january
hampering
some
government
operations
and
suspending
paychecks
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
while
apparently
illegal
the
decision
assured
another
month
of
nutrition
assistance
for
more
than
million
americans
alleviating
some
of
the
stress
and
material
hardship
that
could
have
ensued
if
president
donald
trump
had
continued
the
shutdown
for
another
month
the
gao
also
concluded
in
a
separate
analysis
that
the
administration
illegally
kept
national
parks
open
during
the
shutdown
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
which
administers
the
supplemental
nutrition
assistance
program
snap
was
one
of
the
federal
agencies
that
shuttered
after
trump
failed
to
convince
congress
to
pay
for
a
border
wall
that
he
had
originally
said
mexico
would
pay
for
the
administration
is
generally
hostile
to
the
program
and
has
proposed
regulations
that
would
deny
benefits
to
millions
in
january
when
it
looked
like
the
shutdown
might
continue
for
months
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
announced
that
the
previous
funding
bill
which
expired
on
dec
gave
the
usda
another
days
to
distribute
food
funds
nutrition
assistance
benefits
averaging
about
per
household
go
out
on
debit
cards
near
the
beginning
of
every
month
and
january's
had
already
been
delivered
without
a
hitch
to
make
sure
everyone
would
have
benefits
in
february
but
to
stay
within
the
day
window
perdue
ordered
states
to
send
out
benefits
no
later
than
jan
the
solution
wasn't
perfect
as
it
may
have
confused
some
snap
recipients
and
it
left
a
long
gap
between
benefits
for
february
and
march
it
also
apparently
was
not
legal
usda
had
no
basis
to
alter
its
pattern
of
obligations
so
that
it
could
pay
the
february
benefits
earlier
the
gao
scolded
this
week
in
response
to
a
request
for
legal
analysis
from
house
oversight
committee
chair
elijah
cummings

usda's
action
inappropriately
infringes
on
congress
constitutional
prerogatives
and
implicates
its
latitude
in
making
final
fiscal
year
funding
determinations
in
subsequent
legislation
the
watchdog
continued
the
agency
should
formally
report
to
the
president
and
congress
that
it
violated
the
antideficiency
act
which
prohibits
federal
agencies
from
spending
money
congress
has
not
appropriated
the
gao
concluded
it
is
unlikely
that
such
a
report
if
filed
will
have
any
practical
impact
the
thing
is
members
of
congress
knew
all
along
the
usda's
justification
for
the
early
february
benefits
was
fishy
but
there
was
no
outcry
during
the
shutdown
because
widespread
hunger
was
not
a
savory
prospect
experts
have
credited
food
benefits
for
helping
eliminate
starvation
in
the
u.s.
after
the
s
but
the
gao
report
certainly
memorializes
yet
another
instance
of
lawbreaking
within
the
trump
administration
compared
to
obstruction
of
justice
flouting
a
tax
disclosure
law
illegally
appropriating
border
wall
funds
and
unconstitutionally
accepting
payments
from
foreign
governments
the
early
distribution
of
food
benefits
may
be
the
noblest
violation
but
it's
still
a
violation
it
didn't
even
have
to
happen
david
super
an
expert
on
administrative
and
welfare
law
at
georgetown
university
law
school
argues
that
the
permanent
law
underpinning
snap
actually
qualifies
food
benefits
as
an
entitlement
like
social
security
which
distributes
disability
and
retirement
benefits
even
in
a
shutdown
in
other
words
the
usda
could
have
justified
continuing
benefits
simply
by
pointing
to
the
program's
authorizing
statute
instead
of
relying
on
a
technicality
in
an
expired
appropriation
bill
other
snap
experts
agree
in
addition
to
being
more
clearly
legal
that
approach
also
would
have
avoided
the
hardship
that
the
long
gaps
in
benefits
caused
households
