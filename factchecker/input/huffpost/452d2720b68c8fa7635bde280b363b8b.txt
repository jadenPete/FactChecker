thanks
to
trump
both
chosenone
and
antichrist
are
trending
on
twitter
the
president
told
reporters
he
was
the
chosen
one
to
deal
with
china
as
he
looked
to
the
heavens
once
again
donald
trump
is
making
even
nonreligious
people
say
oh
my
god
on
wednesday
the
president
declared
himself
the
chosen
one
to
take
on
beijing
the
words
chosen
one
have
a
specific
meaning
with
trump's
base
of
evangelical
voters
but
ordinarily
a
comment
like
that
might
seem
benign
since
it
was
referring
to
a
trade
war
not
a
religious
one
however
the
president
blurred
things
by
looking
at
the
heavens
as
he
said
it
also
the
self-praising
comment
came
hours
after
trump
thanked
right-wing
conspiracy
theorist
wayne
allyn
root
for
saying
the
jewish
people
considered
him
both
the
king
of
israel
and
the
second
coming
of
god
on
a
call-in
show
on
newsmax
tv
tuesday
evening
conspiracy
theorist
and
notorious
crank
wayne
allyn
root
made
the
comment
about
american
and
israeli
jews
that
president
trump
just
tweeted
on
his
newsmax
show
last
night

the
president
liked
root's
comments
so
much
he
quoted
them
in
a
three-tweet
thread
thank
you
to
wayne
allyn
root
for
the
very
nice
words
president
trump
is
the
greatest
president
for
jews
and
for
israel
in
the
history
of
the
world
not
just
america
he
is
the
best
president
for
israel
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
the
jewish
people
in
israel
love
him
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
they
love
him
like
he
is
the
second
coming
of
god
but
american
jews
don't
know
him
or
like
him
they
don't
even
know
what
they're
doing
or
saying
anymore
it
makes
no
sense
but
that's
ok
if
he
keeps
doing
what
he's
doing
he's
good
for
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
all
jews

and
importantly
he's

for
everyone
in

a
result

strong
reactions
note
to
white

be
confused

that
jesus

ideally
you
want
the

and
the
guy
who
literally
called

very

one
person
suggested
that
people
who
might
think
trump
is
the
actual
chosen
one
mentioned
in
the
bible
read
the
good
book
first
i
really
really
really
really
wish
that
evangelicals
would
read
their
bibles
thessalonians
describes
the
man
of
sin
who
will
deceive
with
signs
and
wonders
see
matthew
and
proclaim
himself

the

and

kingofthejews
kingofisrael
and
thamendmentnow

all
trending
