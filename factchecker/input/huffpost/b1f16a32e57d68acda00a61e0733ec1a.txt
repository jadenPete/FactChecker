along
the
u.s.
mexico

politico
reported
citing
a
pentagon
official
in
february
president
donald
trump
declared
a
national
emergency
at
the
u.s.
mexico
border
to
sidestep
congress
and
secure
money
to
build
the
border
wall
in
an
attempt
to
thwart
illegal
immigration
despite
initial
promises
that
mexico
would
be
paying
for
the
wall's
construction
the
emergency
declaration
allowed
trump
to
divert
government
money
from
other
projects
to
fund
the
wall
the
effort
faced
legal
challenges
though
the
supreme
court
ruled
in
trump's
favor
in
july
allowing
his
administration
to
redirect
the
military
funds
after
being
notified
of
the
pentagon's
authorization
on
tuesday
schumer
called
the
funding
diversion
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
trump
is
willing
to
cannibalize
already
allocated
military
funding
to
boost
his
own
ego
and
for
a
wall
he
promised
mexico
would
pay
to
build
