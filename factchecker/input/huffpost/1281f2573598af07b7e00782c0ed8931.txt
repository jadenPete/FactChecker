jewish
leaders
blast
trump's
accusations
of
disloyalty
his
claim
that
democrat-leaning
jewish
americans
are
disloyal
is
outright
anti-semitic
the
adl
says
several
prominent
american
jewish
organizations
and
leaders
have
decried
president
donald
trump's
suggestion
this
week
that
jews
who
vote
for
democrats
show
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
the
president
first
made
the
remarks
tuesday
and
on
wednesday
reiterated
that
he
believes
democrat-leaning
jews
were
being
disloyal
to
jewish
people
and
to
israel
jewish
leaders
quickly
pointed
out
that
accusing
jews
of
disloyalty
is
itself
a
common
anti-semitic
trope
jonathan
greenblatt
ceo
of
the
anti-defamation
league
said
wednesday
that
charges
of
disloyalty
long
have
been
used
to
marginalize
or
attack
jewish
people
he
called
the
president's
comments
anti-semitic
let's
be
clear
what
potus
said
was
antisemitic
the
charge
of
disloyalty
or
dual
loyalty
has
been
used
against
jews
for
centuries
almost
a
year
after
the
pittsburgh
shooting
as
antisemitism
continues
to
rise
it's
bewildering
that
we
still
need
to
have
this
conversation

according
to
the
adl
statements
about
a
dual
loyalty
for
jewish
people
suggest
that
their
true
allegiance
is
to
their
coreligionists
around
the
world
or
to
a
secret
and
immoral
jewish
agenda
in
europe
jews
were
accused
for
centuries
of
not
being
sufficiently
loyal
to
the
nations
in
which
they
lived
greenblatt
said
these
charges
were
used
to
justify
their
persecution
or
marginalization
anti-semites
have
also
peddled
conspiracy
theories
about
jews
links
to
social
and
political
movements
such
as
marxism
or
communism
according
to
the
adl
during
the
s
the
nazis
painted
german
jews
as
inherently
disloyal
to
germany
using
this
stereotype
and
other
racist
arguments
to
justify
the
persecution
of
jewish
people
that
led
to
the
holocaust
more
recently
the
stereotype
has
morphed
into
assertions
by
some
that
jews
are
more
loyal
to
israel
than
the
various
countries
in
which
they
reside
the
adl
said
the
observation
that
israel
is
important
to
many
american
jews
becomes
anti-semitic
when
it
is
used
to
impugn
jewish
loyalty
or
trustworthiness
an
adl
article
about
the
stereotype
states
trump
made
his
initial
remarks
on
the
matter
while
speaking
to
reporters
in
the
white
house's
oval
office
on
tuesday
about
israel
barring
the
entry
of
reps
ilhan
omar
d-minn
and
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
because
of
their
criticism
of
its
policies
towards
palestinians
trump
railed
against
democrats
for
defending
these
two
people
over
the
state
of
israel
on
wednesday
the
president
insisted
to
reporters
that
his
statements
about
democrat-leaning
jews
were
not
anti-semitic
he
also
quoted
a
conservative
radio
host
wayne
allyn
root
who
claimed
in
a
tuesday
night
newsmax
broadcast
that
trump
was
the
greatest
president
for
jews
and
that
israelis
love
him
like
he
is
the
king
of
israel
and
the
second
coming
of
god
trump
had
earlier
retweeted
root's
claim
jews
do
not
believe
in
a
second
coming
although
root
refers
to
himself
as
jewish
he
also
converted
to
evangelical
christianity
which
spurred
some
jewish
leaders
to
push
back
on
his
attempts
to
speak
for
american
jews
this
messianic
screed
was
written
by
a
christian
conspiracy
theorist
who
said
trump
should
be
called
the
first
jewish
president
clearly
trump's
real
audience
is
evangelicals
not
jews
of
jews
don't
support
trump
b

his
policies
and
words
are
