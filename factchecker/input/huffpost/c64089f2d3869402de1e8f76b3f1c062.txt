shocked
shooter
got
rifle
in
state
with
spotty

checks
presumably
gov
greg
abbott
knows
that
most
private
gun
sales
in
texas
don't
require
background
checks
texas
gov
greg
abbott
expressed
dismay
on
monday
that
the
mass
shooter
who
killed
seven
people
in
west
texas
had
managed
to
buy
an
ar-style
weapon
in
texas
even
though
he
had
a
criminal
history
and
didn't
register
for
a
background
check
abbott
recently
signed
a
host
of
new
laws
loosening
gun
restrictions
in
texas
following
guidelines
provided
by
the
national
rifle
association
and
the
republican
governor
once
tweeted
that
he
was
embarrassed
that
texas
trailed
california
in
the
number
of
gun
purchases
but
in
a
monday
tweet
abbott
appeared
rattled
that
the
mass
shooter
had
been
able
to
purchase
the
ar-style
gun
that
he
used
in
saturday's
bloody
rampage
in
odessa
and
midland
texas
department
of
public
safety
records
show
that
seth
ator
pleaded
guilty
in
to
misdemeanor
counts
of
criminal
trespass
and
evading
arrest
the
austin
american-statesman
reported
however
only
felonies
and
misdemeanor
domestic
violence
convictions
block
a
gun
purchase
in
texas
according
to
the
texas
tribune
ator
had
failed
to
pass
an
earlier
background
check
to
buy
a
gun
and
didn't
go
thru
a
background
check
for
the
rifle
he
used
on
saturday
according
to
abbott's
tweet
the
governor
did
not
reveal
how
that
gun
was
obtained
but
texas
does
not
require
background
checks
in
most
private
sales
which
includes
some
purchases
at
gun
shows
according
to
the
tribune
abbott
championed
the
series
of
laxer
texas
gun
laws
that
went
into
effect
the
day
after
the
odessa
attack
they
allow
people
to
pack
weapons
in
public
places
such
as
schools
and
churches
as
well
as
in
foster
homes
house
bill
for
instance
bars
school
districts
from
blocking
licensed
gun
owners
from
keeping
their
firearms
in
vehicles
in
school
parking
lots
as
long
as
the
vehicles
are
locked
and
the
weapons
are
out
of
sight
in
june
abbott
also
vetoed
a
bill
that
would
have
made
it
a
state
crime
to
bring
guns
into
secure
areas
of
airports
the
last
time
abbott
addressed
a
mass
shooting
in
texas
was
in
early
august
when
another
gunman
killed
people
in
an
el
paso
walmart
the
governor
acknowledged
at
a
press
conference
then
that
we
did
not
as
far
as
i
know
evaluate
for
and
plan
for
an
incident
like
this
in
any
of
the
new
gun
laws
but
he
emphasized
that
funding
had
been
provided
for
the
state
to
better
address
mental
health
issues
there
has
been
no
indication
that
either
gunman
last
month
suffered
from
mental
illness
after
the
el
paso
attack
abbott
snapped
at
reporters
who
quizzed
him
on
gun
control
saying
we
need
to
focus
more
on
memorials
before
we
start
the
politics
abbott's
dismayed
tweet
after
the
carnage
in
west
texas
about
how
we
must
keep
guns
out
of
criminal
hands
predictably
drew
scorn
for
a
brief
moment
president
donald
trump
suggested
that
he
would
fight
for
stricter
background
checks
after
the
attacks
in
el
paso
and
in
dayton
ohio
where
nine
people
were
killed
the
next
day
but
he
has
since
backed
down
reportedly
after
a
call
from
the
nra
he
insisted
sunday
that
stronger
background
checks
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
in
odessa
though
that
was
before
abbott's
tweet
over
the
last
five
six
or
seven
years
no
matter
how
strong
you
need
the
background
checks
it
wouldn't
have
stopped
any
of
it
trump
told
reporters
