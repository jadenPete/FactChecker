trump's
press
secretary
drags
cnn
for
labeling
alabama
as
mississippi
on
map
the
network
made
the
goof
on
a
map
just
hours
before
the
president's
now-infamous
alabama-related
flub
even
as
president
donald
trump
continues
to
defend
his
erroneous
claim
that
alabama
was
once
threatened
by
hurricane
dorian
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
sought
to
turn
the
tables
thursday
by
spotlighting
a
brief
map
error
by
cnn
concerning
the
state
in
a
twitter
post
she
chided
cnn
for
showing
a
map
during
a
sunday
broadcast
that
mislabeled
alabama
as
mississippi
in
the
process
she
also
took
a
shot
at
the
attention
cnn
along
with
all
other
major
news
outlets
gave
to
trump's
widely
ridiculed
effort
to
deflect
attention
from
his
alabama
miscue
with
a
sharpie-altered
weather
map
on
wednesday
snopes
reports
the
cnn
error
occurred
on
the
early
start
with
dave
briggs
and
christine
romans
program
it
was
corrected
within
seconds
according
to
a
cheeky
response
to
grisham's
tweet
cnn's
mistake
error
occurred
just
a
few
hours
before
trump
posted
his
now-infamous
tweet
falsely
claiming
alabama
could
be
in
dorian's
path
which
prompted
the
national
weather
service
to
issue
a
denial
tweet
minutes
later
some
people
who
were
happy
to
join
grisham
in
slamming
cnn
others
came
to
a
slightly
different
conclusion
and
then
there
was
the
person
who
spoke
for
all
of
america
