deploys
the
insult
to

don't
bend
to
his
will

donald
trump
referred
to
yet
another
woman
as
nasty
during
a
press
gaggle
with
reporters
before
boarding
marine
one
on
wednesday
the
insult
has
become
one
of
his
favorite
ways
to
demean
women
since
launching
his
presidential
campaign
in
whether
his
continued
reliance
on
the
word
is
strategy
the
marking
of
a
simple
mind
or
some
combination
of
the
two
is
the
subject
of
frequent
debate
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
president
has
deployed
a
similar
tactic
to
publicly
insult
the
intelligence
of
black
people
who
don't
comply
with
his
wishes
