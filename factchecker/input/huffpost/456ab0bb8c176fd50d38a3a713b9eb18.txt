and
overworked
canvassers
at
one
of
the
environmental

top
fundraising
groups
are
accusing
management
of
busting
their
attempt
to
unionize
after
the
group
shut
down
a
north
carolina
office
where
workers
announced
they
had
organized
the
fund
for
the
public
interest
pushed
back
insisting
that
it
did
not
interfere
in
the
organizing
process
despite
abruptly
closing
its
chapel
hill
location
in
august
but
people
at
the
fund
saw
the
closure
as
a
warning
to
workers
in
the
group's
outposts
in
more
than
a
dozen
cities
not
to
join
unions
the
clash
is
the
latest
to
pit
young
progressive
activists
against
the
legacy
organizations
that
count
on
them
for
an
endless
supply

of
illegal
attempts
to
snuff
out
their
nascent

efforts
workers
at
the
fund
for
the
public
interest
have
helped
raise
millions
of
dollars
for
liberal
groups
such
as
the
sierra
club
and
the
human
rights
campaign
that
must
do
political
battle
with
better-financed
corporate
lobbies
over
the
years
they
have
also
raised
constant
complaints
about
their
working
conditions
accusing
the
fund
of
unfair
and
unpredictable
pay
unreasonable
quotas
and
punishing
schedules
at
a
moment
when
groups
like
the
league
of
conservation
voters
and
nextgen
america
are
unionizing
and
the
idea
of
a
green
new
deal
is
inspiring
new
alliances
between
the
labor
and
environmental
movements
the
would-be
union
organizers
see
their
effort
as
a
critical
test
of
progressive
values
and
the
fund's
pushback
as
exactly
the
wrong
message
that
shouldn't
be
happening
in
a
progressive
organization
whose
goal
is
political
change

the

does
not
readily
disclose
how
much
it
raises
or
what
share
of
donations
it
turns
over
to
its
clients
but
it
reported
revenues
of
more
than
million
in
the
most
recent
year
for
which
its

filings
are
publicly
available

so
notorious
that
it
has
been
dubbed

were
required
to
bring
in
the
equivalent
of

those
involved
in
organizing
a

told
huffpost
with

coming
in
small
increments
the
quota
was
impossible
to
meet
unless
a
canvasser
worked
at
a
breakneck
pace
for
hours
in
the
outdoors
several
of
them
said
field
organizers
who
failed
to
meet
a
quota
above
the
office's
average
weekly
yield
were
rapidly
demoted

accused
the

of
refusing

dodging

busting
this
summer
the
union
organizers
said
workers
at
several
of
the
fund's
offices
undertook
quiet
efforts
to
unionize
it's
safe
to
say
watercooler
conversations
were
happening
in
every
office
said
one
senior
employee
in
a
major
city
office
who
requested
anonymity
for
fear
of
reprisal
from
management
the
process
unfolded
fastest
in
chapel
hill
organizers
working
with
the
campaign
workers
guild
a
union
for
political
staffers
began
collecting
signatures
in
june
by
july
they
had
the
support
of
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
office
and
asked
chapel
hill
management
to
formally
recognize
their
union
other
offices
watched
the
process
in
chapel
hill
hoping
for
a
different
outcome
than
what
had
happened
in
past
attempts
to
unionize
you
look
at
the
unsuccessful
efforts
and
that
really
dissuades
people
from
going
forward
with
this
the
senior
employee
said
they've
made
it
very
clear
we're
expendable
management
responded
with
what
owen
webster
a
canvasser
and
a
union
organizer
in
the
chapel
hill
office
called
textbook
union
busting
the
fund
refused
to
recognize
the
union
based
on
the
collected
signatures
saying
it
preferred
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
referee
an
election
a
process
that
can
take
weeks
if
not
months
when
union
organizers
proposed
that
a
neutral
third
party
review
the
signatures
they
said
management
never
responded
workers
perceived
the
fund
as
stalling
until
the
usual
rapid
turnover
would
shrink
the
number
of
union
supporters
or
until
it
could
shut
the
office
down
it
put
us
in
the
situation
of
either
abandoning
the
project
entirely
or
continuing
to
escalate
so
they
have
to
pay
serious
attention
to
it
webster
said
we
didn't
know
if
it'd
take
days

among

it

suspicion
that
the

was
screening
inboxes

blocking
select

contain
news

the
dismal
working

that
inspired
them
to
unionize
in
the
first
place
remained
the

four
organizers
told

then
on
aug
the
fund
announced
it
was
shutting
down
the
chapel
hill
office
effective
in
one
week
though
management
didn't
specifically
blame
the
union
organizing
for
the
closure
canvassers
suspected
that
was
the
case
given
that
the
chapel
hill
office
is
typically
open
year-round
in
response
to
huffpost's
questions
the
fund
said
it
respect
s
the
role
of
a
duly
authorized
collective
bargaining
representative
and
would
work
with
the
canvassers
to
arrange
a
fair
election
the
fund
responded
to
the
canvassers
and
campaign
workers
guild
that
we
will
follow
the
established
process
for
determining
if
employees
wish
to
be
represented
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
as
such
we
directed
them
to
the
national
labor
relations
board

we
would
not
interfere

there

office
was
shuttered
for
one
week
after
employees
complained
to
a
state
labor
board
in
the
second
the
office
vanished
after
what
workers
claim
was
an
ugly
campaign
to
derail
a
newly
formed
union
they
changed
the
locks
on
the
doors
and
they
were
gone
one
canvasser

we

ballooned
into
the

the

settled

after
a

of
phone
bankers
in

to

fired
all
six
members
of
the
bargaining
committee
on
what
the
union
claimed
were
trumped-up
infractions
a
judge
later
agreed
that
the

had
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices
against
one
of
the
union
negotiators
and
ordered
his
reinstatement
