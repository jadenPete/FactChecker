questions
in
newly

was
the
chosen

an
old

president
donald
trump
dodges
questions
about
the
bible
is
going

twitter
user

shared
online
wednesday
trump
who'd
earlier
called
the
bible
his
favorite
book
appears
reluctant
to
reveal
his
favorite
verses
because
to
me
that's
very
personal
trump
sidesteps
you
know
when
i
talk
about
the
bible
it's
very
personal
so
i
don't
want
to
get
into
verses
the
bible
means
a
lot
to
me
but
i
don't
want
to
get
into
specifics
when
asked
if
he's
a
bigger
fan
of
the
old
testament
or
the
new
testament
trump
says
he's
probably
equal
i
think
it's
just
incredible
the
whole
bible
is
incredible
he
added
check
out
the
clip
here

mention
that
the
bible
is
your
favorite
book

are
your
favorite
bible
verses
i
don't
want
to
get
into
it
the
bible
means
a
lot
to
me

you
a
new
or
old
testament
guy
probably
equal
the
bible
is
just
incredible

i
assume
this
was
a
sketch
cut
from
snl
where
they
decided
that
alec
baldwin's
trump
character
was
so
blatantly
lying
about
having
ever
read
the
bible
or
gone
in
fact
near
any
book
at
all
that
it
just
got
stupid
