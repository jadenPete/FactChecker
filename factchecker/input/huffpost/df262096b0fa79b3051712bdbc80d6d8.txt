trump
wants
an
apology
for
nonsense
reporting
on
his
alabama
hurricane
fixation
the
president
has
repeatedly
defended
his
erroneous
claim
that
the
clear-skied
state
would
likely
be
hit
by
dorian
president
donald
trump
in
his
umpteenth
tweet
about
clear-skied
alabama
as
hurricane
dorian
roared
through
the
carolinas
argued
on
friday
that
the
press
was
unfairly
fixated
on
his
erroneous
claims
that
alabama
had
almost
certainly
been
in
the
path
of
danger
they
went
crazy
hoping
against
hope
that
i
made
a
mistake
which
i
didn't
he
wrote
adding
this
nonsense
has
never
happened
to
another
president
four
days
of
corrupt
reporting
still
without
an
apology
trump's
troubles
began
sunday
where
they
usually
do
on
twitter
when
he
lumped
alabama
into
a
list
of
states
that
he
speculated
would
most
likely
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
adding
be
careful
god
bless
everyone
just
minutes
later
the
national
weather
service's
birmingham
branch
clarified
in
a
tweet
of
its
own
that
alabama
will
not
see
any
impacts
from
dorian
as
the
storm
would
remain
too
far
east
but
trump
held
fast
to
the
falsehood
insisting
he
was
right
during
a
wednesday
press
conference
where
he
trotted
out
an
outdated
and
doctored
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
map
of
dorian's
predicted
path
a
black
line
had
been
drawn
around
southern
alabama
extending
the
storm's
trajectory
on
thursday
the
president
again
defended
his
claims
on
twitter
decrying
the
attention
of
the
fake
news
media
and
insisting
that
he
was
referring
to
early
predictions
which
had
expired
by
the
time
he
made
his
sunday
tweet
in
total
trump
has
tweeted
about
the
matter
more
than
a
dozen
times
the
white
house
even
released
a
statement
from
homeland
security
and
counterterrorism
adviser
rear
adm
peter
brown
who
attempted
to
shield
the
president
from
further
scrutiny
and
deflect
blame
on
thursday
night
the
washington
post
reported
that
it
was
in
fact
trump
himself
who
altered
the
map
shown
the
day
before
no
one
else
writes
like
that
on
a
map
with
a
black
sharpie
a
white
house
official
told
the
paper
as
of
friday
afternoon
dorian
had
slid
up
the
coast
of
north
carolina
hurtling
northeast
as
a
category
storm
