calls
fox
news
sean
hannity
a
shoe
and
people
put
the
boot
in
trump
also
called
himself
your
favorite
president
in
a
tweet
that
amusingly
backfired
president
donald
trump's
attempt
to
reignite
his
feud
with
some
fox
news
personalities
on
saturday
morning
backfired
when
he
accidentally
called
its
widely
watched
primetime
host
sean
hannity
a
shoe
trump
asked
on
twitter
if
anyone
had
noticed
how
the
top
shows
on
cable
are
those
that
are
fair
or
great
to
your
favorite
president
me
he
then
congratulated
hannity
for
having
the
most
watched
cable
news
show
but
in
his
praise
of
hannity
who
often
stumps
for
trump
on
tv
the
president
wrote
the
number
one
shoe
instead
of
show
trump's
latest
typo
predictably
sparked
myriad
mocking
responses
