slaps
new
tariffs
on

continues
the

said
his
decision
is
retaliation
for

imposing
tariffs

u.s.
president
donald
trump
on
friday
lashed
back
at
a
new
round
of
chinese
tariffs
by
heaping
an
additional
duty
on
some
billion
in
targeted
chinese
goods
in
the
latest
tit-for-tat
trade
war
escalation
by
the
world's
two
largest
economies
trump's
move
announced
on
twitter
came
hours
after
china
unveiled
retaliatory
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
u.s.
goods
prompting
the
president
earlier
in
the
day
to
demand
u.s.
companies
move
their
operations
out
of
china
the
intensifying
u.s.
china
trade
war
stoked
market
fears
that
the
global
economy
will
tip
into
recession
sending
u.s.
stocks
into
a
tailspin
with
the
nasdaq
composite
ixicdown
and
the

spx
down
u.s.
treasury
yields
also
declined
as
investors
sought
safe-haven
assets
and
crude
oil
targeted
for
the
first
time
by
chinese
tariffs
fell
sharply
trump's
tariff
response
was
announced
after
markets
closed
on
friday
leaving
potentially
more
damage
for
next
week
sadly
past
administrations
have
allowed
china
to
get
so
far
ahead
of
fair
and
balanced
trade
that
it
has
become
a
great
burden
to
the
american
taxpayer
trump
said
on
twitter
as
president
i
can
no
longer
allow
this
to
happen
he
said
the
united
states
would
raise
its
existing
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
to
from
the
current
beginning
on
oct
the
th
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
communist
people's
republic
of
china
at
the
same
time
trump
announced
an
increase
in
planned
tariffs
on
the
remaining
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
to
from
the
united
states
will
begin
imposing
those
tariffs
on
some
products
starting
sept
but
tariffs
on
about
half
of
those
goods
have
been
delayed
until
dec
the
u.s.
trade
representative's
office
confirmed
the
effective
dates
but
said
it
would
conduct
a
public
comment
period
before
imposing
the
tariff
rate
on
oct
u.s.
business
groups
reacted
angrily
to
the
new
tariff
hike
it's
impossible
for
businesses
to
plan
for
the
future
in
this
type
of
environment
the
administration's
approach
clearly
isn't
working
and
the
answer
isn't
more
taxes
on
american
businesses
and
consumers

does
this
end

this

among
the
hottest

topics
abrupt
response
the
president's
announcement
which
followed
an
oval
office
meeting
with
his
advisers
fits
a
pattern
of
swift
retaliation
since
the
trade
dispute
with
china
started
more
than
a
year
ago
he
decided
he
wanted
to
respond
he
was
given
a
few
different
options
on
things
he
could
do
and
ultimately
that
was
what
he
decided
a

he's
not

this
stuff
lightly
but
he's
in
a
fine
mood

person
familiar
with
the

said
officials
had
to
scramble
to
come
up
with
options
after
trump
caught
them
offguard
with
tweets
promising
a
response
in
the
afternoon
since
taking
office
in
trump
has
demanded
that
china
make
sweeping
changes
to
its
economic
policies
to
end
theft
and
forced
transfers
of
american
intellectual
property
curb
industrial
subsidies
open
its
markets
to

and

china
denies
trump's
accusations
of
unfair
trade
practices
and
has
resisted
concessions

we
don't
need

our

to
immediately
start
looking
for
an
alternative
to
china

bringing
your

home

it's
unclear
what
legal
authority
trump
would
be
able
to
use
to
compel
u.s.
companies
to
close
operations
in
china
or
stop

said
china's
tariff
list
is
the
result
of
prudent
calculation
with

u.s.
proceeding
at
full
throttle
with
its
beggar-thy-neighbor
policy
china
has
no
choice
but
to
fight
back
to
protect
its
core
national
and
economic
interests
it
said
in
an
editorial
on

china
has
taken
the
countermeasures
so
that

wake
up

the

said
mark

chief
economist
at
moody's
analytics
the
president
is
hoping
that
the
federal
reserve
will
bail
him
out
but
if
he
continues
to
pursue
the
war
the
fed
won't
be
up

among

goods
targeted
by
beijing's

soybeans
which
will

china

beef

pork
from
the

with
an
extra
tariff
as

as
ethanol

from

although
the
trump
administration
has
rolled
out
aid
to

stung
by
china's

there
is
growing
frustration
in
america's
agricultural
belt
a
key
political
constituency
for
trump
as
he
heads
into
his

campaign
the
view
from

country
is
bleak
and
anger
is
boiling
over
with
bankruptcies

delinquencies
rising
and

the

toward
