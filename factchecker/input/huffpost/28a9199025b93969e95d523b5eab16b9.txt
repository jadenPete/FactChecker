ap
iran
acknowledged
for
the
first
time
on
monday
that
a
rocket
at
its
imam
khomeini
space
center
exploded
after
satellite
photos
showed
the
blast
last
week
with
an
official
saying
a
technical
malfunction
during
a
test
caused
the
explosion
the
comments
by
government
spokesman
ali
rabiei
were
the
first
explanation
offered
by
iran
for
thursday's
explosion
which
came
ahead
of
a
planned
satellite
launch
by
the
islamic
republic
that
the
u.s.
has
criticized
rabiei
also
criticized
president
donald
trump
for
tweeting
what
appeared
to
be
a
surveillance
photo
of
the
aftermath
of
the
explosion
shot
by
a
u.s.
spy
satellite
the
explosion
marked
the
third
failure
involving
a
rocket
at
the
iranian
center
which
has
raised
suspicions
of
sabotage
in
iran's
space
program
however
rabiei
dismissed
that
saying
that
this
has
been
a
technical
matter
and
a
technical
error
our
experts
unanimously
say
so
the
explosion
happened
at
the
launchpad
and
no
satellite
had
yet
been
transferred
to
the
launchpad
rabiei
said
it
happened
at
a
test
site
not
at
the
launch
site
commercially
available
satellite
images
by
planet
labs
inc
and
maxar
technologies
showed
a
black
plume
of
smoke
rising
above
a
launch
pad
thursday
with
what
appeared
to
be
the
charred
remains
of
a
rocket
and
its
launch
stand
in
previous
days
satellite
images
had
shown
officials
there
repainted
the
launch
pad
blue
the
photo
released
friday
by
trump
appeared
to
be
a
once-classified
surveillance
photo
from
american
intelligence
agencies
analysts
said
the
black
rectangle
in
the
photo's
upper-left-hand
corner
likely
covered
up
the
photo's
classification
the
image
showed
damaged
vehicles
around
the
launch
pad
as
well
as
damage
done
to
the
rocket's
launcher
it
also
clearly
showed
a
large
phrase
written
in
farsi
on
the
pad
national
product
national
power
the
united
states
of
america
was
not
involved
in
the
catastrophic
accident
during

launch
preparations
for
the
safir

launch
site

in
iran
trump
wrote
in
his
tweet
identifying
the
rocket
used
i
wish
iran
best
wishes
and
good
luck
in
determining
what
happened
at
site
one
rabiei
criticized
trump's
decision
to
tweet
about
the
rocket
explosion
we
don't
understand
why
the
u.
s
president
tweets
and
posts
satellite
pictures
with
excitement
this
is
not
understandable
he
said
maybe
this
is
because
lack
of
iran-related
subjects
that
they
raise
such
issues
the
blast
followed
two
failed
satellite
launches
of
the
payam
and
doosti
in
january
and
february
a
separate
fire
at
the
imam
khomeini
space
center
in
february
also
killed
three
researchers
authorities
said
at
the
time
over
the
past
decade
iran
has
sent
several
short-lived
satellites
into
orbit
and
in
launched
a
monkey
into
space
iran
is
preparing
to
launch
the
nahid-
a
communication
satellite
into
space
the
u.s.
alleges
such
satellite
launches
defy
a
u.n.
security
council
resolution
calling
on
iran
to
undertake
no
activity
related
to
ballistic
missiles
capable
of
delivering
nuclear
weapons
iran
which
long
has
said
it
does
not
seek
nuclear
weapons
maintains
its
satellite
launches
and
rocket
tests
do
not
have
a
military
component
tehran
also
says
it
hasn't
violated
the
u.n.
resolution
as
it
only
called
upon
tehran
not
to
conduct
such
tests
the
tests
have
taken
on
new
importance
to
the
u.s.
amid
the
maximalist
approach
to
iran
taken
by
president
donald
trump's
administration
tensions
have
been
high
between
the
countries
since
trump
unilaterally
withdrew
the
u.s.
from
iran's
nuclear
deal
over
a
year
ago
and
imposed
sanctions
including
on
iran's
oil
industry
iran
recently
has
begun
to
break
the
accord
itself
while
trying
to
push
europe
to
help
it
sell
oil
abroad
