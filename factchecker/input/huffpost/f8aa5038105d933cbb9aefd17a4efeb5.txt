state
lawmakers
representing
the
city
of
flint
michigan
introduced
a
bill
on
tuesday
that
would
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
for
crimes
related
to
the

water
crisis
michigan
senate
minority
leader
jim
ananich
d
and
state
rep
john
cherry
d
said
their
proposed
legislation
which
would
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
from
six
to
years
for
crimes
involving
public
officials
will
provide
enough
time
to
hold
accountable
anyone
who
played
a
role
in
the
crisis
this
legislation
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
people
of
flint
have
the
opportunity
for
justice
to
be
served
and
not
cut
short
because
the
previous
investigation
was
conducted
irregularly
and
ineffectively
cherry
said
in
a
statement
announcing
the
bill
without
the
legislation
the
statute
of
limitation
for
crimes
relating
to
the
man-made
crisis
is
set
to
expire
in
six
years
after
public
officials
decided
to
rely
on
the
flint
river
to
supply
the
city
with
water
their
decision
which
sent
thousands
of
gallons
of
corrosive
water
through
flint's
pipes
precipitated
widespread
sickness
and
deaths
due
to
waterborne
bacteria
flint
will
not
be
able
to
truly
recover
until
those
who
poisoned
our
city
are
held
accountable
by
the
law
