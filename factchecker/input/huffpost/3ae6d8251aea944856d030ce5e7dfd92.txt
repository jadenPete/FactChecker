nobel
prize-winning
economist
robert
shiller
has
warned
that
a
recession
could
be
the
undoing
of
president
donald
trump
in
an
op-ed
published
in
britain's
the
guardian
newspaper
monday
shiller
explained
how
trump
has
for
decades
sold
a
narrative
of
his
life
that
showcases
glamor
by
surrounding
himself
with
apparently
adoring
beautiful
women
and
maintaining
the
appearance
of
vast
influence
but
shiller
cautioned
such
narratives
can't
be
sustained
forever
and
the
end
of
confidence
in
trump's
narrative
is
likely
to
be
associated
with
a
recession
shiller
a
professor
of
economics
at
yale
university
noted
that
people
often
respond
to
recessions
by
reassessing
their
views
spending
less
and
avoiding
making
big-ticket
purchases
that
can
be
postponed
trump
and
his
flashy
lifestyle
have
so
far
been
a
resounding
inspiration
to
many
consumers
and
investors
shiller
noted
in
the
piece
titled
confidence
in
trump's
whims
is
unlikely
to
survive
a
recession
but
a
severe
recession
may
be
his
undoing
he
added
and
even
before
economic
catastrophe
strikes
the
public
may
begin
paying
more
attention
to
his
aberrations
and
to
contagious
new
counter-narratives
that
crowd
