sometimes
treating
pain
is
as
important
as
treating
disease
why
palliative
care
can
make
such
a
difference
and
why
so
few
people
get
it
amy
berman
of
new
york
city
had
been
living
with
inflammatory
breast
cancer
for
about
five
years
when
during
a
ride
on
the
q
train
one
day
in
she
noticed
a
pain
in
her
back
berman
is
a
registered
nurse
and
at
first
she
thought
it
was
a
fracture
the
cancer
had
already
metastasized
to
her
bones
she
knew
making
them
more
susceptible
to
breakage
but
x-rays
and
testing
revealed
a
different
problem
the
metastasis
had
reached
the
center
of
her
spine
causing
pain
that
would
soon
get
worse
berman's
oncologist
recommended
the
standard
course
of
radiation
therapy
with
multiple
doses
although
it
would
likely
turn
off
the
pain
she
learned
it
would
also
cause
weeks
of
severe
side
effects
including
nausea
loss
of
appetite
skin
burning
and
fatigue
at
that
point
berman
consulted
a
palliative
care
specialist
which
is
something
relatively
few
patients
in
her
situation
do
because
they
don't
know
the
option
exists
their
insurance
won't
pay
for
it
or
they
can't
find
a
provider
for
berman
it
made
a
big
difference
palliative
care
focuses
on
the
management
of
pain
and
symptoms
as
well
as
the
quality
of
life
rather
than
trying
to
treat
the
disease
itself
ideally
palliative
care
involves
a
team
of
doctors
nurses
and
social
workers
all
of
whom
work
together
and
in
coordination
with
the
patients
and
their
families
in
this
case
the
palliative
specialist
proposed
an
alternative
a
one-time
larger
dose
of
similarly
targeted
radiation
that
canadian
doctors
had
found
equally
effective
with
far
fewer
side
effects
her
oncologist
in
new
york
agreed
to
try
it
and
the
treatment
worked
even
better
than
expected

recently

got
a

ride
she
credits
palliative
care
with
her
ability
to
keep
working
and
traveling
despite
a
diagnosis
of
inflammatory
breast
cancer
nine
years
ago
nausea
fatigue
skin

berman
had
none
of
those
problems
i'm
peaches
and
cream
with
blue
eyes
so
if
anybody
is
going
to
see
a
radiation
burn
it's
me
berman
who
is
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
huffpost
but
i
had
no
redness
it
wasn't
even
pink
the
very
next
day
berman
was
on
the
acela
train
from
her
home
in
new
york
to
washington
d.c.
for
a
work
trip
she
had
planned
weeks
before
i
felt
great
she
said
it's
not
just
for
end
of
life
berman's
experience
is
a
case
study
in
the
ability
of
palliative
care
to
transform
the
lives
of
people
with
serious
life-threatening
conditions
and
although
many
people
think
of
palliative
care
as
synonymous
with
hospice
care
which
is
for
the
end
of
life
berman's
story
shows
why
it
is
not
simply
or
even
mostly
for
people
whose
diseases
have
run
their
courses
and
who
face
imminent
death
palliative
care
is
also
for
people
who
would
still
benefit
from
disease-altering
and
curative
treatments
as
well
as
people
living
with
chronic
conditions
like
parkinson's
congestive
heart
failure
or
dementia
and
it
appears
to
work
really
well
with
clear
well-documented
benefits
both
for
individual
patients
and
for
society
people
who
get
palliative
care
are
more
likely
to
stay
productive
whether
at
work
or
at
home
and
they
are
less
likely
to
end
up
in
the
emergency
room
that
can
show
up
as
tangible
quantifiable
savings
for
whoever
is
paying
medical
bills
in
one
peer-reviewed
study
researchers
found
savings
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
month
producing
a
positive
return
on
investment
of
to
the
knowledge
and
skills
required
are
still
not
taught
in
undergraduate
and
graduate
medical
and
nursing
education
diane
meier
director
of
the
center
to
advance
palliative
care
numbers
like
that
help
explain
why
interest
in
palliative
care
has
exploded
in
the
last
few
decades
today
roughly
of
u.s.
hospitals
have
a
palliative
care
program
in
less
than
did
but
even
that
rapid
growth
isn't
keeping
up
with
the
demand
especially
with
a
population
that
is
both
getting
older
and
thanks
to
more
advanced
treatments
increasingly
living
for
many
years
with
debilitating
or
terminal
conditions
palliative
care
is
more
difficult
to
find
outside
of
hospital
settings
even
though
one
of
its
main
goals
is
to
help
patients
living
at
home
and
to
keep
them
away
from
emergency
rooms
it
is
also
less
available
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
particularly
the
south
as
many
as
million
americans
live
in
places
with
limited
or
no
palliative
care
options
outside
of
hospitals
according
to
a
study
making
palliative
care
more
widely
available
is
among
the
bigger
challenges
facing
the
u.s.
health
care
system
today
it
requires
more
commitment
from
care
providers
and
policymakers
including
the
ones
in
washington
with
new
cures
medicine
lost
interest
in
comfort
palliative
comes
from
the
latin
word
palliare
to
cloak
and
in
some
respects
palliative
care
harks
back
to
medicine's
pre-technological
origins
when
healers
weren't
actually
that
good
at
healing
unable
to
cure
they
had
to
focus
on
comfort
development
of
anesthesia
sterile
surgical
techniques
and
antibiotics
changed
all
of
that
so
medicine
was
able
to
treat
illness
and
injury
more
successfully
but
in
the
process
medical
professionals
started
paying
less
attention
to
pain
management
and
other
quality-of-life
issues
among
the
pioneers
who
pushed
back
against
that
trend
was
a
canadian
physician
balfour
mount
in
he
created
a
palliative
care
service
at
a
montreal
hospital
modeled
in
part
on
what
he'd
seen
in
hospice
care
in
order
to
alleviate
the
physical
and
emotional
trauma
of
cancer
patients
there
the
name
stuck
and
in
the
world
health
organization
recognized
palliative
care
as
a
separate
medical
specialty
since
then
palliative
care
has
attracted
interest
and
investment
from
a
variety
of
independent
sources
including
philanthropies
such
as
the
john
a.
hartford
foundation
where
berman
is
a
senior
program
officer
the
foundation
focuses
on
care
for
older
adults
she
had
been
working
there
even
before
the
cancer
diagnosis
employers
and
private
insurers
increasingly
include
palliative
care
as
part
of
their
health
benefits
while
the
u.s.
medical
establishment
now
includes
organizations
like
the
american
academy
of
hospice
and
palliative
medicine
which
represents
doctors
nurses
and
other
professionals
who
are
part
of
palliative
care
teams
but
even
now
many
of
the
people
who
would
benefit
from
palliative
care
don't
get
it
one
reason
is
the
common
misperception
that
palliative
care
is
only
for
the
end
of
life
a
notion
that
insurers
can
reinforce
by
the
way
they
structure
benefits
sometimes
patients
face
a
terrible
choice
medicare
is
a
perfect
example
its
hospice
benefit
will
pay
for
precisely
the
sort
of
team-oriented
approach
that
is
ideal
for
palliative
care
but
to
get
the
benefit
medicare
beneficiaries
must
first
relinquish
their
right
to
further
disease
treatment
it
is
literally
an
either
or
paper
you
sign
diane
meier
director
of
the
center
to
advance
palliative
care
told
huffpost
it's
like
signing
your
own
death
certificate
and
nobody
wants
to
do
that
my
colleagues
call
it
the
terrible
choice
families
parents
and
clinicians
do
not
like
to
self-label
as
dying
she
explained
the
either-or
concept
keeps
people
away
from
the
care
they
need
and
drives
them
to
the
only
place
that
has
to
take
them
in
a
crisis
emergency
department
hospital
palliative
care
is
the
best
friend
of
the
seriously
ill
amy
berman
senior
program
officer
at
the
john
a.
hartford
foundation
some
private
plans
already
cover
coordinated
palliative
care
as
a
concurrent
option
for
people
who
are
still
getting
disease
treatment
meier
would
like
that
to
become
the
rule
not
the
exception
for
private
plans
and
for
medicare
too
although
the
ideal
she
said
would
be
a
financing
system
that
moved
away
from
fee-for-service
altogether
if
governments
and
insurers
simply
paid
providers
to
look
after
their
patients
health
whatever
that
took
then
the
providers
could
more
easily
integrate
palliative
care
into
their
practices
let's
say
i'm
a
heart
patient
meier
explained
i
should
be
able
to
get
palliative
care
and
consultation
and
support
at
the
same
time
i
am
seeing
my
cardiologist
today's
problems
will
get
worse
tomorrow
another
more
basic
reason
why
many
people
don't
get
palliative
care
is
that
it's
hard
to
find
providers
the
american
board
of
medical
specialties
has
recognized
palliative
care
as
a
subspecialty
since
to
get
certification
physicians
must
go
through
residency
in
family
medicine
psychiatry
or
some
other
form
of
primary
care
and
then
complete
a
one-year
fellowship
on
palliative
care
specifically
today
just
actively
practicing
physicians
have
gone
through
that
training
according
to
the
american
academy
of
palliative
care
and
hospice
medicine
that
is
not
enough
to
meet
demand
right
now
to
say
nothing
of
the
future
the
ratio
of
palliative
care
specialists
to
patients
will
actually
decline
for
the
next
years
according
to
one
recent
study
that
appeared
in
the
journal
health
affairs
and
it
will
never
come
back
to
the
current
level
unless
there
are
more
training
slots
and
more
people
to
fill
them
and
it's
not
just
the
lack
of
physician
specialists
making
palliative
care
hard
to
get
a
family
doctor
or
say
an
oncology
nurse
with
even
a
little
palliative
care
training
is
more
likely
to
be
attentive
to
pain
management
and
family
issues
and
to
know
when
consultation
with
a
specialist
is
necessary
but
medical
schools
nursing
schools
and
teaching
hospitals
haven't
done
a
great
job
of
integrating
palliative
care
into
their
standard
curricula
the
knowledge
and
skills
required
are
still
not
taught
in
undergraduate
and
graduate
medical
and
nursing
education
meier
said
requirements
for
accreditation
for
these
schools
have
essentially
not
changed
for
decades
despite
the
radical
changes
in
population
needs
a
national
strategy
comes
into
focus
more
training
slots
and
more
promotion
of
palliative
care
by
leaders
of
the
medical
establishment
would
help
experts
say
so
would
national
standards
for
palliative
care
programs
just
to
make
sure
they
offer
a
full
range
of
services
that
patients
need
and
new
payment
schemes
to
support
those
programs
even
seemingly
small
things
like
guaranteeing
hour
access
to
the
palliative
care
team
can
make
a
big
difference
a
major
reason
many
patients
with
debilitating
or
terminal
diseases
end
up
in
emergency
rooms
is
that
they
encounter
medication
or
symptom
problems
after
business
hours
or
on
weekends
to
help
reach
these
goals
meier
berman
and
several
colleagues
in
called
for
a
national
strategy
on
palliative
care
the
model
would
be
the
national
hiv
aids
strategy
and
the
national
alzheimer's
project
act
which
brought
together
government
and
private-sector
leaders
in
order
to
reorganize
and
improve
care
for
those
conditions
among
the
recommendations
likely
to
emerge
from
such
a
strategy
is
getting
health
insurers
to
pay
for
palliative
care
directly
or
indirectly
and
training
more
providers
both
would
cost
more
money
in
the
short
run
which
is
why
advocates
spend
so
much
time
talking
up
the
studies
that
show
the
investment
can
save
money
in
the
long
run
this
is
also
why
they
highlight
stories
like
berman's
which
show
what
a
difference
good
palliative
care
can
make
palliative
care
is
the
best
friend
of
the
seriously
ill
she
said
they
help
me
live
a
great
life
even
with
stage
cancer
related
coverage
this
treatment
can
improve
a
patient's
quality
of
life
but
it's
not
widely
available
the
health
care
debate
that
wasn't
