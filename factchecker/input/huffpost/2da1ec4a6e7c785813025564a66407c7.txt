the
real

market
for

hasn't
changed
it
isn't
for

sen
tom

r-ark
is
still
prodding
president
donald

to
buy
it
touting
its
ideal
geographic
location
and
mineral-rich
land
ripe
with

in

monday
cotton
made
his
case
for
purchasing
the
autonomous
danish
territory
arguing
that
although
trump's
critics
predictably
derided
him
as
crazy
after
news
broke
of
his
interest
the
president
is
crazy
like
a
fox
the
acquisition
of
greenland
would
secure
vital
strategic
interests
for
the
united
states
economically
benefit
both
us
and
greenlanders
and
would
be
in
keeping
with
american
and
danish
diplomatic
traditions
the
senator
wrote
cotton
noted
that
he
himself
had
even
raised
the
prospect
of
acquiring
greenland
with
the
danish
ambassador
just
last
year
word
of
the
president's
interest
in
greenland
surfaced
earlier
this
month
when
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
he
had
spoken
with
varying
degrees
of
seriousness
about
a
purchase
which
included
asking
his
white
house
counsel
to
look
into
the
matter
administration
officials
confirmed
interest
in
such
a
deal
but
the
prospective
sellers
were
notably
cool
to
the
idea
following
the
journal's
report
greenland's
foreign
minister
ane
lone
bagger
told
reuters
the
island
is
open
for
business
but
we're
not
for
sale
the
following
week
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
told
fox
news
that
the
white
house
was
looking
at
it
and
trump
confirmed
in
a
press
conference
that
a
large
real
estate
deal
was
something
we
talked
about
attempting
to
drive
bagger's
message
home
once
and
for
all
denmark's
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
called
the
president's
idea
an
absurd
discussion
adding
that
she
hoped
trump
wasn't
serious
cotton
however
remains
serious
and
in
his
op-ed
portrayed
purchasing
greenland
as
a
potentially
key
move
amid
escalating
trade
tensions
with
china
greenland
is
rich
in
a
wide
array
of
mineral
deposits
including
rare-earth
minerals
resources
critical
to
our
high-tech
and
defense
industries
he
said
china
currently
dominates
the
market
in
these
minerals
and
has
threatened
to
withhold
them
from
us
to
gain
leverage
in
trade
negotiations
greenland
also
possesses
untold
reserves
of
oil
and
natural
gas
cotton
also
defended
the
purchasing
effort
at
a
luncheon
last
week
in
his
home
state
the
arkansas
democrat-gazette
reported
it's
obviously
the
right
decision
for
the
united
states
and
anyone
who
can't
see
that
is
blinded
by
trump
derangement
he
said
at
the
least
the
lack
of
interest
from
greenland
officials
didn't
sit
well
with
trump
after
frederiksen
dismissed
talk
of
a
sale
as
absurd
trump
cancelled
a
planned
early
september
stop
in
denmark
related
sen
tom

apparently
told

to
