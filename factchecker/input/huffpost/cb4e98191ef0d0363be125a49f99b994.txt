who
says
trial
judge
was
anti-semitic
the
texas
judge
presiding
over
randy
halprin's
case
was
a
racist
and
anti-semitic
bigot
the
inmate's
lawyers
contend
american
jewish
groups
are
chiming
in
to
support
a
jewish
inmate
on
texas
death
row
who
contends
that
the
judge
who
presided
over
his
capital
murder
trial
was
anti-semitic
the
union
for
reform
judaism
the
largest
jewish
denomination
in
the
u.s.
joined
with
the
advocacy
group
american
jewish
committee
over
jewish
lawyers
in
texas
and
others
to
file
an
amicus
brief
on
thursday
in
support
of
randy
halprin
who
is
asking
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
stay
his
scheduled
oct
execution
among
the
evidence
cited
by
the
groups
is
an
anti-semitic
slur
the
judge
allegedly
used
to
describe
halprin
note
that
the
judge's
language
appears
uncensored
below
the
brief
argued
that
halprin
has
a
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
judge
well
into
the
twenty-first
century
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
a
trial
conducted
before
a
racist
judge
who
boasts
of
his
bigotry
is
no
trial
at
all
ajc
general
counsel
marc
stern
said
in
a
related
press
release
halprin
was
sentenced
to
death
in
by
then
state
district
judge
vickers
vic
cunningham
for
his
role
in
the
so-called
texas
prison
escape
halprin
was
one
of
seven
men
who
escaped
from
a
south
texas
prison
in
december
and
went
on
to
commit
several
robberies
including
a
christmas
eve
crime
in
which
a
police
officer
was
killed
four
members
of
the
group
have
already
been
executed
the
fifth
killed
himself
before
he
could
be
recaptured
and
the
sixth
is
also
set
to
be
executed
this
year
the
push
to
stay
halprin's
death
date
is
part
of
a
larger
effort
to
obtain
a
new
trial
for
him
halprin's
lawyers
argued
in
a
federal
appeal
in
may
that
cunningham
was
a
racist
and
anti-semitic
bigot
who
privately
described
their
client
as
that
fuckin
jew
and
a
goddamn
kike
cunningham
also
believed
in
anti-semitic
conspiracy
theories
about
jewish
people
the
lawyers
wrote
judge
cunningham's
prejudices
bias
and
animus
towards
jews
precluded
him
from
being
the
impartial
judge
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
requires
the
appeal
states
his
central
role
in
the
trial
from
start
to
finish
constitutes
a
structural
defect
and
requires
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
sentence
of
death
be
vacated
the
lawyers
claimed
that
cunningham
would
also
use
derogatory
language
and
racial
slurs
to
talk
about
african
americans
latino
americans
and
catholics
the
former
judge
did
not
immediately
respond
to
huffpost's
request
for
comment
last
year
the
dallas
news
reported
that
cunningham
had
set
up
a
living
trust
with
a
clause
that
rewarded
his
children
if
they
married
white
christians
of
the
opposite
sex
an
arrangement
that
cunningham
later
confirmed
family
members
described
him
as
a
lifelong
racist
cunningham
told
the
dallas
news
that
his
views
on
interracial
marriage
have
evolved
he
also
denied
the
allegation
that
he
harbored
any
racial
bigotry
he
lost
his
race
last
year
to
become
the
gop
nominee
for
dallas
county
commissioner
the
anti-defamation
league
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
halprin
in
federal
court
in
june
the
jewish
groups
who
signed
onto
thursday's
amicus
brief
declined
to
take
a
stance
on
halprin's
guilt
or
innocence
instead
they
argued
that
cunningham
should
have
recused
himself
from
halprin's
case
because
of
his
biased
views
toward
jewish
people
they
are
asking
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
stay
halprin's
execution
and
order
a
hearing
on
the
allegations
against
cunningham
if
the
allegations
here
are
true
and
they
unfortunately
ring
true
the
trial
was
no
trial
and
the
verdict
was
no
verdict
because
the
judge
was
no
judge
stern
said
