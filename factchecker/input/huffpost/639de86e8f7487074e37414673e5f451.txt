he

erroneously
tweeted
and
later
said
sunday
that
alabama
was
in
the
projected
path
of
hurricane
dorian
the
birmingham
nws
quickly
issued
a
notice
contradicting
trump
five
days
later
after
trump
relentlessly
insisted
he
was
correct
and
even
tried
to
back
up
his
story
by
presenting
an
altered
national
hurricane
center
map
on
which
he
himself
circled
alabama
with
a
marker

disavowed
the
statement
by
the
nws
contradicting
trump
the

national
weather
service's
sunday
morning
tweet
spoke
in
absolute
terms
that

from
the
best

products
available
at
the
time
said
an
unsigned
statement
from
noaa
information
and
maps
disseminated
to
the
public
clearly
demonstrated
that

winds
from
hurricane
dorian
could
impact
alabama
clearly
that's
not
the
case
