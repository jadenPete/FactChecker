the
justice
department
is
under
fire
for
allegedly
including
a
link
to
a
white
nationalist
website
in
its
daily
news
briefing
emailed
to
immigration
court
employees
on
monday
the
memos
have
been
sent
to
staffers
each
morning
by
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
only
this
time
as
first
reported
by
buzzfeed
news
one
included
a
link
to
vdare
com
which
is
described
by
the
southern
poverty
law
center
as
an
anti-immigration
hate
website
in
a
letter
obtained
by
huffpost
ashley
tabaddor
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
told
doj
on
thursday
that
the
union
had
received
numerous
complaints
from
judges
across
the
nation
who
found
the
blog
post
offensive
and
felt
it
signified
a
hostile
work
environment
the
post
features
links
and
content
that
directly
attacks
sitting
immigration
judges
with
racial
and
ethnically
tinged
slurs
and
the
label
kritarch
she
said
the
reference
to
kritarch
in
a
negative
tone
is
deeply
offensive
and
anti-semitic
as
tabaddor
explains
the
term
intended
as
a
slur
in
this
case
refers
to
kritarchy
a
system
of
judicial
rule
that
once
existed
in
ancient
israel
vdare's
use
of
the
term
in
a
pejorative
manner
casts
jewish
history
in
a
negative
light
as
an
anti-semitic
trope
of
jews
seeking
power
and
control
she
added
the
union
has
asked
that
the
eoir
issue
an
apology
and
take
immediate
steps
to
ensure
that
such
posts
or
content
is
not
enshrined
as
a
legitimate
news
source
in
its
future
publications
on
friday
eoir
assistant
press
secretary
kathryn
mattingly
appeared
to
blame
the
action
on
a
contract
employee
from
a
private
company
that
creates
its
briefings
the
daily
eoir
morning
news
briefings
are
compiled
by
a
contractor
and
the
blog
post
should
not
have
been
included
she
said
in
a
statement
to
huffpost
the
department
of
justice
condemns
anti-semitism
and
white
nationalism
in
the
strongest
terms
in
a
later
statement
she
said
eoir
had
decided
not
to
renew
its
contract
with
the
company
and
has
ceased
distribution
of
a
daily
news
briefing
to
its
staff
vdare
has
a
long
history
of
promoting
racism
and
xenophobia
as
evidenced
by
its
blog
posts
in
one
entry
on
the
website
claimed
that
america
was
defined
almost
explicitly
sometimes
very
explicitly
as
a
white
nation
for
white
people
questioning
whether
the
new
and
non-white
version
should
even
be
called
america
anymore
another
post
published
in
employs
anti-semitic
tropes
stating
that
jewish
communities
have
engaged
in
an
elaborate
and
highly
successful
group
competitive
strategy
to
obtain
control
of
economic
resources
and
political
power
despite
the
eoir's
condemnation
of
hatred
according
to
matthew
hoppock
an
immigration
attorney
who
obtained
eoir
briefings
via
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
published
them
online
from
september
to
march
past
memos
have
included
right-wing
sources
such
as
breitbart
and
the
daily
caller
both
of
which
have
published
biased
and
at
times
false
stories
this
article
has
been
updated
with
an
additional
statement
from
mattingly
to
reflect
that
eoir
has
decided
to
cut
ties
with
the
company
providing
its
briefings
and
will
cease
distributing
them
