proud

leader
admits
their
rallies
are
for
fighting
and
wasting
money
the
group
brawls
with
antifa
under
the
guise
of
free

but

exposes
its
true
intentions
violence
and
wasting
public
resources
the
proud
boys
for
years
have
helped
organize
street
fights
in
portland
oregon
gatherings
thinly
veiled
as
political
freedom
rallies
in
order
to
secure
permits
or
police
escorts
from
the
city
this
week
that
veil
was
lifted
as
the
group's
leader
admitted
the
ugly
and
obvious
truth
the
events
are
staged
with
the
intention
of
spurring
fights
wasting
city
resources
and
winning
a
game
of
optics
against
their
anti-fascist
nemeses

tarrio

joe

flew
to
portland
from
florida
to
host
the
rally
and
fears
among
city
officials
about
the
potential
chaos
caused
them
to
warn
local
businesses
to
close
for
the
day

a

force

was
deployed
according
to

the
closures
cost
local
restaurants
and
other
businesses
an
estimated
million
in
revenue
and
taxpayers
will
likely
be
on
the
hook
for
millions
more
due
to
the

is
a
pure

fewer
violent
clashes
broke
out
than
in
previous
iterations
of
the
rally
in
part
because
police
spent
the
day
escorting
and
defending
the
proud
boys
and
members
of
their
local
punch-happy
cousin
the
patriot
prayer
but
the
proud
boys
were
also
keenly
aware
that
the
nation
was
watching
president
donald
trump
tweeted
just
before
the
rally
began
that
he
would
be
on
the
lookout
for
violence
committed
by
anti-fascists
in
order
to
designate
antifa
an
organization
of
terror
as
the
rally
kicked
off
tarrio
was
caught
on
video
ordering
his
gang
members
to
forgo
the
fighting
on
this
day
nobody
would
be
earning
their
fourth
degree
a
rank
given
to
those
proud
boys
who
assault
anti-fascists
this
is
a
pure
optics
operation

rather
than
attack
protesters
as
they've
planned
to
do
in
the
past
the
proud
boys
retreated
across
the
willamette
river
and
then
left
the
city
announcing
on
their
way
out
a
new
campaign
to
waste
portland's
time
and
revenue
an
apparent
political
maneuver
aimed
at
mayor
ted
wheeler
the
gathering
was
never
about
bringing
carnage
or
violence
to
the
city
of
portland
it
was
about
financially
crippling
the
progressive
hotbed
until
they
take
action
against
antifa
the
gang
said
in
a
press
release
this
appears
to
be
the
first
public
admission
by
the
proud
boys
that
the
group's
aim
is
to
hobble
wheeler's
administration
the
mayor
has
allowed
these
rallies
to
go
on
in
the
name
of
free
speech
despite
acknowledging
that
violence
is
often
the
only
item
on
the
agenda
it's
unclear
whether
the
newfound
transparency
will
have
any
impact
on
future
demonstrations
in
a
response
to
huffpost
wheeler
decried
tarrio's
statements
but
didn't
say
whether
he'd
allow
the
group
to
continue
to
host
the
events
in
portland
i
have
one
clear
message
to
anyone
who
says
they're
going
to
continue
wasting
the
city's
resources
over
and
over
again
stop
wasting
our
time
stop
wasting
taxpayer
dollars
stop
hurting
our
businesses
we
have
a
city
to
run
and
lives
to
lead
he
said
although
tarrio
on
the
video
mentions
another
rally
planned
for
october
no
city
permits
have
been
issued
as
yet
for
such
a
gathering
