democrats
insist
they
haven't
been
wasting
time
on
trump's
tax
returns
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
is
the
one
who's
been
slow
they
tell
a
federal
court
congressional
democrats
didn't
sue
the
administration
for
copies
of
president
donald
trump's
tax
returns
as
quickly
as
they
could
have
but
they
insist
they
haven't
been
wasting
time
the
timing
of
the
lawsuit
is
important
because
courts
are
slow
and
democrats
would
like
to
win
the
case
before
election
day
it's
unclear
if
that's
going
to
be
possible
this
month
the
democrats
pace
became
a
big
issue
in
the
case
itself
house
democrats
filed
their
complaint
in
july
and
last
week
they
asked
u.s.
district
judge
trevor
mcfadden
to
expedite
the
proceedings
the
trump
administration
responded
that
the
democrats
themselves
didn't
hurry
before
so
they
can't
ask
the
court
to
hurry
now
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
waited
three
months
from
the
start
of
the
current
session
of
congress
when
it
first
had
the
power
of
federal
tax
disclosure
at
its
fingertips
to
make
the
initial
request
for
the
president's
returns
after
the
administration
denied
the
request
the
committee
waited
almost
another
two
months
before
bringing
suit
according
to
a
filing
last
week
from
the
justice
department
and
the
president's
personal
lawyers
the
committee
showed
no
urgency
and
offered
little
to
no
explanation
for
its
leisurely
pace
in
short
having
failed
itself
to
act
in
an
expeditious
manner
the
committee
cannot
now
complain
about
the
delays
inherent
in
ordinary
civil
practice
or
the
investment
of
time
required
for
careful
presentation
and
consideration
of
the
issues
implicated
by
this
case
trump's
team
argued
on
monday
evening
democrats
disputed
the
idea
that
they've
been
slow
offering
the
fullest
defense
to
date
of
their
strategy
for
obtaining
the
president's
tax
returns
previously
house
ways
and
means
chairman
richard
neal
d-mass
had
simply
said
the
committee
needed
to
be
deliberative
and
follow
the
advice
of
the
house's
lawyers
in
response
to
the
trump
administration's
gripes
house
general
counsel
douglas
letter's
team
said
that
most
of
the
delays
have
been
the
administration's
fault
first
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
declined
to
testify
before
the
committee
until
march
when
committee
members
initially
asked
him
about
requesting
copies
of
the
president's
tax
returns
mnuchin
then
took
more
than
a
month
to
decline
a
formal
request
and
a
whole
additional
week
to
say
no
to
the
subsequent
subpoena
one
reason
the
committee
didn't
ask
to
expedite
the
case
before
last
week
the
house
lawyers
argued
was
that
at
the
end
of
july
it
received
an
unsolicited
communication
from
a
federal
employee
setting
forth
credible
allegations
of
evidence
of
possible
misconduct
in
other
words
a
whistleblower
gave
the
panel
possible
evidence
of
someone
interfering
with
an
internal
revenue
service
audit
of
the
president
which
could
be
a
pretty
big
deal
and
the
lawyers
pointed
out
that
the
administration
is
essentially
complaining
that
democrats
are
too
slow
and
too
fast
at
the
same
time
those
arguments
are
inherently
contradictory
and
are
meritless
in
any
event
they
wrote
there's
no
question
that
dragging
things
out
could
be
advantageous
for
the
trump
administration
since
the
president's
tax
returns
might
reveal
more
evidence
of
corruption
that
could
spur
impeachment
proceedings
or
hurt
his
standing
with
voters
in
november
he
is
already
the
first
modern
president
to
refuse
to
divest
from
his
private
businesses
in
addition
to
being
the
first
since
before
richard
nixon
to
keep
his
returns
private
but
it's
also
normal
for
the
justice
department
to
want
to
resolve
purely
legal
issues
such
as
whether
the
committee
has
standing
to
sue
before
turning
to
potentially
fact-intensive
questions
such
as
the
actual
merits
of
the
case
said
alexander
reinert
a
professor
at
the
benjamin
n.
cardozo
school
of
law
democrats
want
to
consolidate
the
schedule
looking
at
legal
and
fact
issues
simultaneously
while
trump's
team
wants
more
briefings
and
more
hearings
threshold
questions
of
justiciability
standing
jurisdiction
those
are
extremely
important
and
need
to
be
addressed
at
the
outset
reinert
said
the
law
in
question
seems
very
clear
it
says
that
if
ways
and
means
or
another
tax
committee
asks
the
treasury
department
for
someone's
taxes
then
the
department
shall
hand
over
the
material
but
the
trump
administration
insists
that
congressional
democrats
don't
have
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
which
courts
have
said
is
a
necessity
for
a
congressional
investigation
and
that
they
merely
want
to
embarrass
the
president
democrats
say
their
request
for
trump's
taxes
easily
clears
the
bar
for
legitimate
use
of
congress
oversight
powers
since
the
democrats
took
control
this
year
ways
and
means
members
have
stressed
that
they
won't
necessarily
publicize
trump's
tax
returns
if
they
obtain
them

hauser
director
of
the
revolving
door
project
an
anti-corruption
initiative
affiliated
with
the
liberal
center
for
economic
and

research
said
democrats
would
have
a
stronger
case
if
they'd
filed
lawsuits
to
enforce
more
than
a
few
of
the
dozen-plus
congressional
subpoenas
that
the
trump
administration
has
defied
democrats
flooding
the
zone
in
the
d.c.
circuit
with
subpoena
litigation
would
convince
judges
that
the
situation
is
exceptional
and
requires
an
unusually
expeditious
response
