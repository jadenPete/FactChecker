trump
appears
to
cave
to
nra
on
background
checks
then
maybe
not
the
nra
said
that
it
spoke
to
the
president
and
that
he's
a
strong
second
amendment
advocate
president
donald
trump
has
soured
on
plans
for
enhanced
federal
background
checks
for
firearm
purchases
after
speaking
with
gun
lobbyists
an
abrupt
about-face
just
weeks
after
a
pair
of
mass
shootings
left
people
dead
according
to
multiple
media
reports
the
atlantic
on
tuesday
reported
that
trump
had
spoken
with
wayne
lapierre
the
chief
executive
of
the
national
rifle
association
earlier
that
day
to
assure
the
head
of
the
nation's
largest
gun
rights
group
that
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
following
the
massacres
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
earlier
this
month
the
mass
killings
renewed
bipartisan
calls
for
stricter
gun
control
legislation
and
the
president
appeared
to
be
considering
the
background
check
measure
in
the
days
after
the
shootings
we
need
intelligent
background
checks
ok
this
isn't
a
question
of
nra
republican
or
democrat
trump
told
reporters
outside
the
white
house
earlier
this
month
we
don't
want
insane
people
mentally
ill
people
bad
people
dangerous
people
we
don't
want
guns
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
people
but
speaking
to
the
press
in
the
oval
office
on
tuesday
the
president
appeared
to
walk
back
that
language
saying
that
the
country
had
very
very
strong
background
checks
already
instead
he
focused
on
the
mental
health
of
mass
shooters
we
have
missing
areas
and
areas
that
don't
complete
the
whole
circle
and
we're
looking
at
different
things
trump
said
and
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
is
a
mental
problem
and
i've
said
it
a
hundred
times
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
people
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
huffpost's
request
for
comment
on
the
conversation
with
lapierre
but
the
nra
confirmed
later
tuesday
that
lapierre
had
spoken
with
the
president
referring
to
trump
as
a
strong
second
amendment
advocate
the
group
is
opposed
to
universal
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
we
discussed
the
best
ways
to
prevent
these
types
of
tragedies

then
on
wednesday
trump
seemed
to
reverse
himself
again
denying
that
he'd
taken
the
issue
off
the
table
we're
going
to
be
doing
background
checks
he
told
reporters
trump's
apparent
cooling
on
the
idea
had
come
amid
a
two-week
working
vacation
at
his
golf
club
in
bedminster
new
jersey
conversations
with
democratic
lawmakers
have
also
largely
stalled
the
washington
post
reported
noting
that
congress
is
out
of
session
for
its
summer
recess
but
politico
noted
tuesday
night
that
white
house
aides
were
still
mulling
potential
responses
to
the
shootings
even
as
the
president's
statements
on
the
matter
waffle
trump's
reported
capitulation
to
the
nra
echoed
his
response
to
other
mass
shootings
including
the
massacre
in
parkland
florida
that
left
students
and
adults
dead
following
that
event
the
president
expressed
support
for
universal
background
checks
but
he
later
pulled
back
from
those
plans
after
meeting
with
the
nra
and
went
so
far
as
to
threaten
to
veto
any
proposed
gun
control
measures
top
democrats
pointed
out
trump's
pattern
of
flip-flopping
amid
tuesday's
reports
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
urged
the
president
to
support
a
bipartisan
background
check
bill
that
has
already
passed
in
the
house
but
has
languished
in
the
upper
chamber
these
retreats
are
heartbreaking
particularly
for
the
families
of
the
victims
of
gun
violence
schumer
wrote
on
twitter
if
you're
serious
about
action
the
way
forward
is
for
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
to
put
the
bipartisan
house-passed
background
checks
bill
up
for
a
