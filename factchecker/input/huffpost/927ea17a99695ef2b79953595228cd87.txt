the

president
donald
trump
lashed
out
at
london
mayor
sadiq
khan
with
a
pair
of
tuesday
morning
tweets
defending
his
golf
habit
after
the
mayor
criticized
him
for
hitting
the
links
as
hurricane
dorian
headed
for
the
u.s.
southeast
coastline
trump
on
friday
suggested
he
would
spend
all
of
the
next
day
monitoring
the
storm
at
camp
david
instead
he
spent
hours
playing
golf
at
his
private
club
in
virginia
he
returned
to
the
golf
course
on
monday
for
another
game
the
incompetent
mayor
of
london
sadiq
khan
was
bothered
that
i
played
a
very
fast
round
of
golf
yesterday
trump
wrote
tuesday
after
first
misspelling
the
mayor's
first
and
last
names
the
two
men
have
clashed
repeatedly
since
trump
took
office
in
and
proposed
banning
muslims
from
entering
the
united
states
khan
is
london's
first
muslim
mayor
in
his
tweets
trump
misleadingly
compared
his
golfing
to
the
ways
other
politicians
unwind
such
as
by
exercise
or
travel
me
i
run
through
one
of
my
courses
very
inexpensive
president
obama
would
fly
to
hawaii
trump
wrote
his
claim
that
his
presidential
golf
trips
aren't
costly
is
also
wrong
trump
has
already
cost
american
taxpayers
more
than
million
for
golf
getaways
since
his
january
inauguration
according
to
huffpost's
analysis
that's
more
than
the
travel
expenses
former
president
barack
obama
accrued
over
eight
years
a
conservative
group
estimated
trump
also
encouraged
vice
president
mike
pence
to
stay
at
his
luxury
golf
club
in
ireland
pence
took
him
up
on
it
even
though
his
meetings
with
irish
leaders
are
in
dublin
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
country
many
critics
say
that
by
spending
so
many
taxpayer
dollars
on
his
own
properties
trump
is
violating
the
constitution's
emoluments
clause
prohibiting
presidents
from
profiting
off
their
role
in
the
oval
office
trump
had
planned
to
join
other
world
leaders
in
poland
over
the
weekend
to
commemorate
the
th
anniversary
of
the
start
of
world
war
ii
he
said
hurricane
dorian
which
has
devastated
the
bahamas
prompted
him
to
cancel
speaking
to
reporters
from
the
event
in
poland
khan
noted
sarcastically
that
trump
was
clearly
busy
dealing
with
a
hurricane
out
on
the
golf
course
the
comment
apparently
rankled
trump
who
does
not
often
address
criticisms
of
his
golfing
according
to
cnn's
count
the
president
has
so
far
spent
days
of
his
presidency
at
one
of
his
golf
clubs
khan
trump
said
should
focus
on
knife
crime
which
is
totally
out
of
control
in
london
he
is
a
terrible
mayor
who
should
stay
out
of
our
business
the
president
fumed
a
white
house
spokesperson
said
over
the
weekend
that
trump
was
receiving
hourly
updates
on
hurricane
dorian
which
has
left
at
least
five
dead
in
the
caribbean
despite
this
the
president
incorrectly
warned
alabamians
on
monday
to
prepare
for
the
hurricane
to
hit
their
state
and
doubled
down
on
the
idea
when
challenged
even
after
officials
issued
a
correction
stating
that
alabama
wasn't
threatened
dorian
has
weakened
from
a
category
to
a
category
hurricane
and
was
still
approaching
florida
on
tuesday
