tensions
mount
between
trump
pence
camps
heading
into
election
the
relationship
between
the
president
and
vice
president's
teams
has
soured
greatly
since
the
gop's
resounding
losses
in
the
midterms
washington
when
vice
president
mike
pence
flew
to
europe
as
the
stand-in
for
president
trump
at
the
th
anniversary
of
the
start
of
world
war
ii
it
appeared
to
be
another
sign
that
the
famously
fickle
president
trusted
his
vice
president
but
pence's
decision
while
in
ireland
to
stay
at
the
trump
golf
resort
in
doonbeg
the
area
his
grandfather
emigrated
from
a
century
ago
caught
washington
insiders
as
another
act
of
fealty
from
a
vice
president
derided
at
times
as
overly
obsequious
even
oleaginous
on
the
surface
trump
and
pence
insist
they
have
a
great
relationship
and
are
working
closer
than
ever
to
win
reelection
in
they've
consistently
beaten
back
rumors
that
former
u.n.
ambassador
nikki
haley
is
in
the
running
to
replace
pence
on
the
ticket
but
behind
the
scenes
tensions
have
been
mounting
among
trump
pence
and
their
top
advisers
ever
since
the
gop's
resounding
losses
in
the
midterms
in
the
weeks
afterward
trump
asked
aides
about
replacing
pence
on
the
ticket
and
he
asked
again
for
their
thoughts
on
pence
during
his
august
vacation
at
his
golf
course
in
bedminster
n.j.
according
to
trump
advisers
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
talk
about
private
discussions
with
the
president
current
and
former
trump
and
pence
advisers
interviewed
for
this
story
as
well
as
my
forthcoming
biography
of
pence
piety
power
mike
pence
and
the
taking
of
the
white
house
consistently
described
a
personal
relationship
between
trump
and
pence
that
is
warm
but
somewhat
aloof
pence
has
a
lane
that
he
sticks
to
in
the
white
house
conservative
social
policy
but
he
is
not
considered
to
be
as
influential
as
people
like
jared
kushner
or
stephen
miller
but
the
relationship
between
their
political
teams
has
soured
greatly
in
the
past
year
according
to
a
dozen
trump
and
pence
aides
and
republican
advisers
familiar
with
the
dynamic
in
particular
rumors
that
kushner
and
ivanka
trump
wanted
to
consider
replacements
for
pence
specifically
trying
to
find
a
woman
running
mate
to
help
win
back
the
suburbs
in
have
worried
the
vice
president's
camp
according
to
trump
and
pence
campaign
advisers
who
spoke
on
background
for
this
story
however
none
of
those
advisers
claimed
to
have
heard
kushner
or
ivanka
trump
directly
discuss
pence's
replacement
and
a
senior
white
house
official
categorically
denied
the
couple
had
been
involved
in
discussing
changes
to
the
ticket
this
story
has
been
shopped
in
multiple
forms
to
multiple
media
outlets
but
was
never
run
by
the
others
because
the
sourcing
didn't
hold
up
or
withstand
scrutiny
it
is
false
said
the
senior
white
house
official
when
asked
about
the
anecdote
and
one
pence
adviser
noted
that
trump
has
repeatedly
told
the
vice
president
that
he
has
nothing
to
worry
about
and
that
stories
of
him
possibly
being
removed
from
the
ticket
are
fake
news
regardless
of
the
rumor
mill
there
do
appear
to
be
tensions
between
the
trump
and
pence
camps
the
perception
is
that
pence's
team
is
difficult
to
work
with
one
trump
adviser
said
the
adviser
noted
that
in
his
talks
with
trump
the
president
has
occasionally
asked
what
the
adviser
thinks
of
pence
and
his
aides
that
just
doesn't
come
up
organically
somebody
is
saying
that
to
the
president
the
adviser
said
there
are
certain
pockets
out
there
that
want
to
solve
their
problems
by
replacing
the
running
mate
said
the
pence
adviser
but
we're
on
the
team
we
might
be
jv
but
we're
helping
reelect
him
the
pence
adviser
noted
that
trump
would
automatically
keep
the
support
of
transactional
evangelicals
televangelists
like
john
hagee
and
jerry
falwell
jr
heir
to
the
moral
majority
founded
by
his
father
but
pence
is
essential
to
keeping
quiet
less
political
evangelical
voters
in
the
fold
for
trump
mike
pence
is
an
exemplary
vice
president
and
has
played
a
valuable
role
in
the
administration
he
will
also
be
a
key
asset
as
president
trump's
running
mate
in
trump
campaign
communications
director
tim
murtaugh
said
in
a
statement
to
yahoo
news
at
the
staff
level
everyone
works
together
as
one
seamless
team
with
a
singular
focus
the
reelection
of
president
trump
and
vice
president
pence
in
november
the
vice
president's
office
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
as
he
returned
from
vacation
trump
beat
back
the
idea
i
think
mike
pence
has
been
an
outstanding
vp
trump
told
reporters
in
new
jersey
shortly
before
boarding
air
force
one
i
think
that
he
has
been
incredible
in
terms
of
the
love
that
a
lot
of
people
especially
if
you
look
at
the
evangelicals
and
so
many
others
they
really
have
a
great
respect
for
the
vice
president
and
so
do
i.
and
so
do
i
think
most
people
kushner
and
ivanka
trump
who
have
formed
the
political
core
of
trump's
reelection
effort
with
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
have
sidelined
pence's
top
political
aides
on
the
reelection
longtime
fundraiser
marty
obst
and
former
spokesman
marc
lotter
according
to
trump
campaign
advisers
a
pence
adviser
noted
that
they
have
had
some
trouble
working
with
trump's
campaign
during
the
past
year
in
the
spring
pence's
aides
went
to
parscale
to
ask
if
he
could
include
a
question
testing
pence's
favorability
on
a
poll
he
was
doing
of
battleground
states
according
to
trump
campaign
advisers
familiar
with
the
request
parscale
said
it
was
too
late
to
add
the
question
to
the
poll
but
what
he
didn't
tell
pence's
aides
is
that
the
question
was
already
on
the
poll
done
in
states
when
the
results
came
back
pence's
favorability
was
higher
than
trump's
something
parscale
and
the
campaign's
pollsters
withheld
from
trump
and
pence
but
obst
pence's
chief
political
aide
who
also
works
as
a
senior
adviser
on
the
trump
campaign
used
a
mole
inside
the
president's
campaign
to
get
a
copy
of
one
of
the
polls
parscale
did
not
return
repeated
requests
for
comment
spokespeople
for
the
trump
campaign
and
pence
also
did
not
return
repeated
requests
for
comment
haley
inflamed
those
tensions
two
weeks
ago
when
she
tweeted
her
insistence
that
she
would
never
replace
pence
on
the
ticket
and
fully
supported
pence
and
trump
and
even
though
pence's
advisers
are
fairly
sure
the
vice
president
will
make
it
onto
the
trump
ticket
in
they
aren't
percent
certain
which
has
led
some
pence
advisers
and
friends
to
chafe
at
trump's
treatment
of
the
vice
president
they
see
trump
keeping
pence
on
a
tight
leash
leveraging
the
uncertainty
over
to
get
him
to
pass
loyalty
tests
for
trump
one
pence
confidant
bemoaned
pence's
cancellation
of
a
new
hampshire
trip
at
the
start
of
july
and
subsequent
trip
to
a
border
detention
camp
as
examples
of
trump
yanking
on
pence's
leash
this
was
before
it
was
reported
widely
the
new
hampshire
trip
was
canceled
because
pence
would
have
appeared
onstage
with
a
former
new
york
giants
player
accused
of
smuggling
opioids
a
few
weeks
later
in
july
members
of
the
republican
national
committee
gathered
in
charlotte
n.c.
and
chattered
about
what
would
become
of
the
vice
president
pence
had
long
been
sold
as
a
stable
force
in
trump's
orbit
helping
to
bring
weary
republicans
into
the
fold
in
and
beyond
and
he
remains
a
popular
figure
with
the
rnc
he's
on
a
tightrope
said
one
rnc
member
who
helped
secure
pence's
place
on
the
trump
ticket
in
and
is
trying
to
ensure
he
stays
there
for
if
he
takes
mike
pence
off
the
ticket
that
would
just
be
despicable
the
rnc
member
said
that
pence's
team
appears
worried
about
the
relationship
with
the
president
people
come
into
the
vp's
office
trying
to
find
out
what's
going
on
with
trump
and
he
can't
give
them
an
answer
the
member
said
one
former
adviser
to
trump
and
pence
noted
that
trump
would
more
warmly
embrace
the
vice
president
in
public
if
pence
simply
announced
that
he
wasn't
planning
a
run
for
president
trump
the
former
adviser
noted
hates
aides
who
display
more
ambition
than
him
all
of
this
would
go
away
if
he
announced
he
wasn't
running
for
president
in
the
former
adviser
