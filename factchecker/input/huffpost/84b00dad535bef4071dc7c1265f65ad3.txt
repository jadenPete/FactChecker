has
been
jailed
since
his
arrest
months
ago
and
could
be
eligible
for
immediate
release
if
kelly
imposes
the
sentence
that
prosecutors
recommended
in
a
court
filing
the
fbi
said
clark
is
a
self-described
white
nationalist
who
followed
pittsburgh
synagogue
shooting
suspect
robert
bowers
on
the
gab
social
media
platform
and
referred
to
him
as
a
hero
in
a
post
after
the
october
shooting
bowers
spewed
anti-semitic
hatred
on
his
gab
account
before
killing
people
and
wounding
seven
inside
the
synagogue
authorities
said
clark
was
arrested
after
relatives
called
the
fbi
on
nov
to
report
their
concerns
that
he
could
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
they
told
fbi
agents
that
clark
became
really
riled
up
after
his
younger
brother
edward
shot
and
killed
himself
within
hours
of
the
pittsburgh
attack
clark
faces
a
maximum
sentence
of
years
in
prison
after
pleading
guilty
to
one
count
of
illegal
possession
of
firearms
by
a
person
who
is
an
unlawful
user
of
a
controlled
substance
however
sentencing
guidelines
call
for
a
sentence
ranging
from
to
months
the
judge
isn't
bound
by
the
guidelines
prosecutors
are
urging
the
judge
to
prohibit
clark
from
possessing
firearms
and
order
him
to
refrain
from
any
threatening
behavior
in
person
or
on
social
media
while
he
is
on
supervised
release
clark
also
should
be
required
to
attend
threat-assessment
meetings
with
the
fbi
up
to
four
times
per
year
if
the
fbi
requests
it
prosecutors
said
david
bos
a
federal
public
defender
representing
clark
hadn't
publicly
filed
his
own
sentencing
memo
as
of
thursday
afternoon
bos
didn't
immediately
respond
to
an
email
and
telephone
call
seeking
comment
on
the
government's
recommendation
when
fbi
arrested
clark
on
nov
and
searched
his
home
they
found
flyers
from
a
neo-nazi
organization
boxes
of
ammunition
body
armor
a
rope
noose
hanging
above
his
bed
and
a
nazi
flag
containing
the
handwritten
inscription
hail
victory
prosecutors
wrote
on
thursday
after
the
death
of
edward
clark
jeffrey
clark
became
more
outspoken
about
his
radical
views
expressing
them
openly
to
his
family
members
who
were
in
the
area
following
edward
clark's
death
an
fbi
agent
wrote
in
an
affidavit
during
these
conversations
jeffrey
clark
defended
robert
bowers
killings
at
the
tree-of-life
synagogue
jeffrey
clark
also
stated
that
he
and
edward
clark
had
both
fantasized
about
killing
jews
and
blacks
the
relatives
also
believed
year-old
edward
clark
may
have
been
planning
to
carry
out
an
act
of
violence
that
day
before
he
went
to
theodore
roosevelt
island
in
the
nation's
capital
and
killed
himself
the
agent
wrote
clark's
plea
agreement
says
a
post-indictment
investigation
by
federal
authorities
found
no
evidence
that
he
had
advance
knowledge
of
the
synagogue
attack
or
that
he
was
planning
an
independent
attack
against
similar
targets
in
washington
obviously
this
would
be
a
very
different
case
if
he
did
the
judge
said
during
a
hearing
in
july
clark's
online
postings
statements
and
items
found
inside
his
home
show
he
has
a
deep-rooted
hatred
for
certain
minorities
and
a
penchant
for
glorifying
violence
assistant
u.s.
attorney
john
cummings
wrote
in
thursday's
memo
added
to
the
inherently
dangerous
combination
of
firearms
and
drugs
the
defendant's
then-held
views
plainly
enhanced
his
potential
danger
to
the
community
cummings
added
bos
the
public
defender
has
said
clark's
distasteful
comments
on
the
internet
are
constitutionally
protected
free
speech
and
don't
make
him
dangerous
in
july
bos
asked
the
judge
to
release
his
client
before
sentencing
and
allow
him
to
live
under
house
arrest
with
one
of
the
relatives
who
had
contacted
the
fbi
we're
not
just
letting
him
loose
on
society
