donald
trump
is
still
whining
about
his
alabama
falsehood
the
president
has
dragged
an
admiral
into
his
efforts
to
prove
he
was
right
to
say
hurricane
dorian
would
hit
alabama
as
the
east
coast
gets
battered
by
hurricane
dorian
president
donald
trump
has
made
clear
that
his
first
priority
is
to
keep
insisting
he
wasn't
wrong
about
something
he
was
wrong
about
days
after
trump
was
proven
wrong
about
the
hurricane's
predicted
trajectory
the
white
house
released
a
statement
thursday
afternoon
maintaining
that
the
president
was
right
the
headache
began
this
past
sunday
when
trump
tweeted
that
alabama
would
be
hit
much
harder
than
anticipated
by
the
hurricane
which
started
to
make
landfall
thursday
on
the
carolina
coasts
he
was
quickly
corrected
by
the
birmingham
branch
of
the
national
weather
service
which
tweeted
that
no
impacts
from
hurricane
dorian
will
be
felt
across
alabama
the
system
will
remain
too
far
east
but
the
president
wouldn't
let
it
go
not
content
with
his
initial
blunder
trump
held
a
hurricane
briefing
on
wednesday
in
which
he
displayed
a
weather
map
that
showed
dorian's
projected
path
there
were
only
two
problems
one
that
particular
map
was
from
last
week
between
that
projection
and
his
sunday
tweet
the
revised
predictions
for
dorian
had
it
shifting
in
a
more
northerly
direction
two
the
map
appeared
to
be
altered
with
a
new
black
line
adding
southern
alabama
to
the
impact
zone
when
a
reporter
asked
whether
somebody
had
drawn
on
the
map
trump
repeatedly
said
i
don't
know
his
hurricane
flubs
didn't
stop
there
the
president
also
made
news
this
week
when
he
said
he'd
never
heard
of
a
category
storm
even
though
dorian
is
the
fourth
storm
of
that
magnitude
during
his
presidency
of
course
none
of
that
matters
to
the
president
who
will
likely
continue
to
insist
he's
right
as
other
states
get
hit
by
the
storm
and
alabama
remains
unscathed
later
on
thursday
trump
reportedly
called
fox
news
senior
white
house
correspondent
john
roberts
to
his
office
apparently
in
search
of
backup
from
his
favorite
network
roberts
detailed
the
encounter
to
his
colleagues
in
an
internal
email
obtained
by
cnn
trump
was
just
looking
for
acknowledgment
that
he
was
not
wrong
for
saying
that
at
some
point
alabama
was
at
risk
even
if
the
situation
had
changed
by
the
time
he
issued
the
tweet
on
sunday
morning
roberts
wrote
trump
even
provided
him
graphics
in
an
attempt
to
prove
his
point
he
insisted
roberts
wrote
that
it
is
unfair
to
say
alabama
was
never
threatened
by
the
storm
