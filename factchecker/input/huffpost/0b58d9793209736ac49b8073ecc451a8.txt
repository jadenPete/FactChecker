trump
administration
asks
scotus
to
legalize
firing
lgbtq
workers
based
on
sexuality
the
brief
filed
friday
echoes
a
similar
one
submitted
last
week
seeking
to
legalize
firing
transgender
workers
based
on
their
gender
identity
the
trump
administration
is
urging
the
supreme
court
to
use
a
forthcoming
handful
of
lgbtq
rights
cases
to
legalize
firing
someone
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
friday
the
justice
department
argued
that
a
trio
of
cases
set
to
appear
before
the
supreme
court
this
fall
should
be
used
to
limit
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
which
prohibits
discrimination
because
of
sex
under
the
justice
department's
reading
of
title
vii
sex
as
written
in
the
civil
rights
act
doesn't
mean
sexual
orientation
therefore
they
argue
the
law
shouldn't
be
used
to
protect
gay
lesbian
and
bisexual
workers
the
original
bill
didn't
define
sex
as
a
term
and
the
trump
administration
is
now
using
that
ambiguity
to
argue
that
lawmakers
original
intent
focused
solely
on
protecting
women's
rights
title
vii's
prohibition
on
discrimination
because
of
sex
does
not
bar
discrimination
because
of
sexual
orientation
the
brief
argues
the
ordinary
meaning
of
sex
is
biologically
male
or
female
it
does
not
include
sexual
orientation
an
employer
thus
discriminates
because
of
sex
under
title
vii
if
it
treats
members
of
one
sex
worse
than
similarly
situated
members
of
the
other
sex
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
standing
alone
does
not
satisfy
that
standard
in
a
bit
of
odd
logic
this
latest
memo
also
cites
congress
historical
inability
to
pass
legislation
explicitly
barring
such
discrimination
as
reason
to
now
set
a
legal
precedent
permitting
it
bills
seeking
to
add
sexual
orientation
to
the
list
of
protected
traits
in
title
vii
have
been
introduced
but
not
enacted
in
every
congress
since
the
brief
reads
including
earlier
this
year
since
fewer
than
of
the
bills
introduced
in
congress
ever
made
it
to
a
vote
according
to
data
analyzed
by
govtrack
the
filing
is
the
second
such
request
by
the
justice
department
in
as
many
weeks
last
friday
the
trump
administration
undertook
a
similar
action
in
pursuit
of
legalizing
discrimination
against
transgender
workers
should
the
court
agree
with
the
doj
when
it
hears
the
cases
in
october
transgender
and
lgbtq
americans
could
find
themselves
at
greater
risk
for
discrimination
not
just
in
the
workplace
but
in
housing
healthcare
and
education
on
tuesday
in
response
to
a
reporter's
question
president
donald
trump
said
he
thinks
he's
done
really
very
well
with
the
lgbtq
community
adding
they
like
the
job
i'm
doing
related
coverage
trump's
war
on
lgbtq
americans
is
ramping
up
trump
administration
asks
supreme
court
to
legalize
firing
transgender
workers
even
some
republicans
are
urging
the
supreme
court
to
protect
lgbtq
employees
the
fight
for
civil
rights
is
far
from
over
