lawmakers

urge
trump's
family
to
persuade
the
president
to
step
aside
for
mike
pence
donald
trump's
onetime
pal
and
briefly
his
communications
director
anthony
scaramucci
called
on
the
gop
friday
to
get
trump
out
of
the
white

because
the
president
is
melting
down
like
a
nuclear
reactor
we
gotta
change
pitchers
he
told
chuck
todd
on
msnbc's
mpt
daily
scaramucci
told
todd
that
republicans
can't
want
him
to
remain
in
office
because
trump
is
going
to
lose
the
election
in
and
he's
completely
unhinged
scaramucci
suggested
senior
republican
leadership
talk
to
trump's
family
and
say
enough
is
enough
and
urge
them
to
help
persuade
trump
to
resign
before
he
completely
embarrasses
himself
scaramucci
added
let
mike
pence
take
over
trump
is
on
the
ropes
now
in
part
for
grossly
underestimating
china
scaramucci
said
he
totally
overplayed
his
hand
todd
zinged
scaramucci
at
the
start
of
the
program
by
playing
a
clip
of
his
first
official
comments
as
white
house
communications
director
in
july
the
mooch
gushed
then
that
trump
had
some
of
the
best
political
instincts
in
the
world
as
well
as
really
good
karma
and
was
a
wonderful
human
being
scaramucci
was
out
days
after
he
was
hired
scaramucci
told
todd
that
his
characterization
of
trump
was
accurate
at
the
time
but
he
said
the
job
has
taken
a
toll
on
the
president
he
said
earlier
this
week
that
he
was
forming
a
political
action
committee
to
run
ads
against
trump's
reelection
