limits
the
amount
of
time
the
government
can
detain
immigrant
children
the
flores
settlement
also
established
guidelines
for
safe
and
sanitary
conditions
in
detention
centers
that
provide
children
with
basic
needs
like
food
water
and
medical
care
california
governor
gavin
newsom
d
who
is
leading
the
charge
on
the
lawsuit
criticized
president
donald
trump
for
his
policies
on
immigration
and
family
separation
yet
again
president
trump
is
disregarding
basic
human
rights
and
using
helpless
immigrant
children
as
political
pawns
to
further
his
ideological
agenda
newsom
said
in
a
monday
statement
california
will
emphatically
assert
itself
to
protect
the
welfare
and
safety
of
all
children
regardless
of
where
they
come
from
or
the
color
of
their
skin
