doubt
green
new
deal
promises
we
don't
believe
it
the
union's
president
said
climate
change
is
real
but
thinks
coal
miners
won't
be
taken
care
of
in
progressives
effort
to
address
it
the
head
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
doesn't
trust
democrats
green
new
deal
to
deliver
for
coal
miners
in
a
press
conference
wednesday
that
was
part
political
speech
and
part
history
lesson
umwa
president
cecil
roberts
said
miners
have
been
jilted
too
many
times
to
expect
congress
to
take
care
of
them
in
a
government-led
shift
away
from
fossil
fuels
when
people
tell
us
we're
going
to
pass
legislation
you're
going
to
have
the
best
jobs
in
the
world
they're
going
to
be
union
jobs
don't
worry
about
anything
we
don't
believe
it
roberts
said
at
the
national
press
club
in
washington
when
people
keep
telling
us
how
wonderful
we're
going
to
have
it
we've
got
many
reasons
to
believe
that's
not
the
case
roberts
pointed
to
the
constant
political
fights
his
union
has
waged
to
preserve
pensions
and
retiree
health
benefits
over
the
last
two
decades
as
coal
companies
have
tried
to
shed
their
obligations
through
bankruptcy
proceedings
the
umwa's
pension
plan
is
on
track
to
become
insolvent
within
just
a
few
years
and
congress
has
done
nothing
so
far
to
make
sure
miners
don't
end
up
with
pennies
on
the
dollar
people
are
talking
about
us
needing
a
transition
well
our
transition
has
unfortunately
been
at
the
bankruptcy
court
roberts
said
nobody
cares
about
this
let's
be
honest
roberts
speech
delivered
the
same
day
a
climate
town
hall
for
presidential
hopefuls
would
be
broadcast
on
cnn
underscored
one
of
the
major
hurdles
progressive
democrats
face
in
enacting
some
form
of
a
green
new
deal
to
dramatically
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
address
climate
change
the
proposal
calls
for
a
sweeping
industrial
plan
to
rapidly
shift
away
from
fossil
fuels
plant
billions
of
trees
and
rebuild
infrastructure
to
withstand
a
hotter
less
predictable
world
there
are
different
versions
of
such
a
plan
though
all
promise
to
create
good-paying
jobs
and
look
after
workers
in
industries
hurt
in
the
transition
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
one
of
the
most
vocal
proponents
of
a
green
new
deal
has
spoken
often
about
how
a
climate
package
should
fully
fund
the
miners
endangered
pension
plan
presidential
hopeful
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
has
a
plan
that
includes
billion
for
the
black
lung
disability
fund
and
a
guaranteed
five
years
of
salary
health
care
and
pension
support
for
workers
displaced
by
the
move
to
renewable
energy
several
other
contenders
for
the
democratic
nomination
proposed
federal
programs
modeled
on
the
gi
bill
to
help
coal
miners
train
for
new
lines
of
work
while
roberts
said
he's
appreciated
the
dialogue
his
union
has
had
with
ocasio-cortez
and
others
he
made
clear
he
doesn't
buy
that
a
green
new
deal
would
produce
union
jobs
on
par
with
the
disappearing
coal
jobs
he
mocked
the
very
idea
noting
how
badly
unions
have
struggled
to
successfully
organize
workplaces
the
union
membership
rate
is
just
percent
in
the
private
sector
nationally
so
few
jobs
in
the
booming
solar
industry
are
unionized
that
the
nonprofit
solar
foundation
stopped
tracking
them
in
its
annual
census
report
three
years
ago
i
understand
somehow
magically
if
certain
people
get
elected
president
they're
going
to
make
those
union
jobs
and
they're
going
to
require
them
to
pay
what
you
get
make
now
roberts
said
i
don't
believe
that
i
just
can't
make
that
work
in
my
mind
in
june
the
green
new
deal
picked
up
two
major
labor
endorsements
from
the
service
employees
international
union
and
the
association
of
flight
attendants
which
is
part
of
the
communications
workers
of
america
union
the
united
electrical
radio
machine
workers
of
america
followed
suit
last
month
but
powerful
construction
unions
that
rely
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
for
lucrative
jobs
such
as
the
laborers
international
union
of
north
america
and
the
international
brotherhood
of
electrical
workers
remained
firmly
opposed
we're
talking
about
not
just
eliminating
coal
miners
jobs
it
would
also
cost
building
trade
jobs
that
they
have
now
utility
worker
jobs
roberts
said
i
don't
think
a
good
starting
point
for
democrats
is
to
eliminate
union
jobs
it
seems
to
me
what
democrats
need
is
a
lot
more
union
members
as
opposed
to
fewer
roberts
made
clear
that
he
believes
in
climate
change
it's
real
it
needs
to
be
dealt
with
but
argued
that
further
curbing
coal
use
in
the
u.s.
would
do
little
when
coal-fired
power
plants
continue
to
open
in
other
countries
roberts
speech
came
at
a
time
when
politicians
and
the
media
appear
to
be
paying
more
attention
than
usual
to
coal
miners
president
donald
trump
made
them
a
central
theme
of
his
election
holding
rallies
with
trump
digs
coal
signs
news
outlets
have
been
sending
reporters
to
appalachia
to
see
how
the
president's
coal
promises
are
playing
out
and
a
road
blockade
staged
by
unpaid
miners
in
kentucky
has
made
front-page
news
the
sanders
campaign
sent
pizza
to
the
miners
last
month
but
roberts
said
political
concerns
for
miners
often
turn
out
to
be
hollow
he
noted
that
it's
been
nearly
years
since
the
upper
big
branch
mining
disaster
killed
miners
in
west
virginia
and
despite
promises
at
the
time
congress
still
has
not
reformed
mine
safety
laws
everybody
wants
to
get
their
pictures
taken
with
a
coal
miner
when
they're
running
for
office
roberts
said
but
they
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
us
once
they
get
into
office
roberts
had
criticism
for
trump
too
the
president
has
often
claimed
falsely
that
the
coal
sector
is
being
rejuvenated
under
his
watch
but
in
reality
coal
consumption
is
at
its
lowest
level
in
decades
despite
the
administration's
efforts
to
deregulate
the
industry
coal-fired
power
plants
continue
to
close
not
because
of
emissions
rules
but
because
of
cheap
natural
gas
employment
in
the
coal
industry
is
hovering
around
just
up
just
a
little
bit
more
than
a
thousand
from
when
trump
took
office
in
coal
is
not
back
roberts
said
roberts
asked
that
the
president
who
claims
to
be
a
friend
of
coal
miners
do
them
a
favor
on
twitter
if
he
just
tweeted
just
make
us
seconds
of
his
day
that
he
felt
that
coal
miners
entitled
to
pensions
should
have
them
i
think
that
might
be
enough
roberts
said
i'm
pleading
with
him
to
do
that
