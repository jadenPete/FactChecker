trump
administration
announces
plan
to
detain
migrant
children
for
longer
the
new
guidelines
would
rip
up
a
long-standing
set
of
protections
known
as
the
flores
settlement
the
trump
administration
on
wednesday
announced
new
rules
that
would
allow
immigration
officials
to
detain
migrant
children
for
a
longer
period
of
time
ripping
up
a
long-standing
set
of
protections
that
prevent
migrant
children
from
being
detained
for
more
than
days
the
flores
settlement
established
in
after
a
class-action
lawsuit
involving
several
migrant
children
limits
the
amount
of
time
the
government
is
allowed
to
detain
an
immigrant
child
to
days
or
less
the
agreement
also
establishes
minimum
guidelines
for
safe
and
sanitary
conditions
in
detention
facilities
requiring
the
government
to
provide
children
with
basic
needs
like
food
water
and
medical
care
the
rule
change
would
allow
families
to
be
detained
indefinitely
by
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
after
being
transferred
from
border
custody
barring
any
potential
court
order
the
change
would
go
into
effect
days
from
friday
doctors
psychologists
and
child
welfare
experts
have
said
that
even
relatively
brief
time
in
detention
is
damaging
to
children's
mental
and
physical
health
the
administration
claims
that
its
inability
to
indefinitely
detain
kids
is
one
of
the
drivers
of
unauthorized
migration
to
the
u.s.
since
the
beginning
of
the
fiscal
year
in
october
border
patrol
says
it
has
apprehended
more
than
family
units
parents
and
kids
traveling
together
at
the
southwest
border
the
driving
factor
in
this
crisis
is
weakness
in
our
legal
framework
for
immigration
kevin
mcaleenan
the
acting
secretary
of
homeland
security
said
wednesday
at
a
press
conference
mcaleenan
called
the
flores
settlement
a
key
gap
in
our
immigration
framework
arguing
that
the
rule
change
closes
a
legal
loophole
effectively
incentivizing
illegal
entry
the
rule
change
first
proposed
last
year
continues
the
trump
administration's
expanded
practices
of
separating
families
and
detaining
immigrants
in
teeming
border
facilities
with
inhumane
conditions
recently
a
number
of
undocumented
immigrants
have
died
while
in
the
custody
of
immigration
officials
including
children
eric
gay
associated
press
detained
immigrant
children
line
up
in
the
cafeteria
at
the
karnes
county
residential
center
a
detention
center
for
immigrant
families
in
karnes
city
texas
the
proposed
rule
will
almost
certainly
face
pushback
from
immigrant
and
human
rights
groups
including
a
likely
legal
challenge
this
is
yet
another
cruel
attack
on
children
who
the
trump
administration
has
targeted
again
and
again
with
its
anti-immigrant
policies
madhuri
grewal
american
civil
liberties
union
policy
counsel
said
in
a
statement
the
government
should
not
be
jailing
kids
and
certainly
shouldn't
be
seeking
to
put
more
kids
in
jail
for
longer
congress
must
not
fund
this
the
trump
administration
has
floated
indefinite
detention
of
kids
as
an
alternative
to
the
much-criticized
policy
of
family
separation
the
president
carried
out
last
year
last
year
officials
suggested
that
locking
up
kids
with
their
parents
would
keep
families
together
the
obama
administration
dramatically
expanded
the
use
of
family
immigrant
detention
after
parents
and
children
began
coming
to
the
u.s.
without
authorization
in
large
numbers
in
and
after
the
administration
had
previously
reduced
family
detention
but
opened
new
centers
in
order
to
deal
with
the
influx
to
the
dismay
of
immigrant
rights
activists
and
some
democratic
politicians
now
the
trump
administration
wants
to
expand
family
detention
even
further
another
step
in
a
large-scale
effort
to
keep
migrants
even
asylum-seekers
from
coming
to
the
u.s.
the
administration
has
also
implemented
policies
to
make
asylum-seekers
remain
in
mexico
while
awaiting
court
proceedings
and
to
bar
asylum
for
people
who
pass
through
another
country
without
seeking
safety
there
the
latter
was
partially
blocked
but
allowed
to
go
into
effect
in
texas
and
new
mexico
in
addition
to
cracking
down
on
undocumented
immigrants
the
administration
has
also
targeted
legal
immigrants
earlier
this
month
it
announced
new
guidelines
that
would
effectively
prohibit
immigrants
on
government
assistance
such
as
food
stamps
and
housing
vouchers
from
applying
for
visas
or
permanent
residency
this
story
has
been
updated
throughout
related
coverage
the
trump
administration
plans
to
detain
more
children
and
for
longer
this
is
why
so
many
children
are
dying
in
border
patrol
custody
in
their
own
words
migrant
