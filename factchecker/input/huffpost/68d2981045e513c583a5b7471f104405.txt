questioned
whether
it
would
have
been
politically
prudent
for
trump
to
personally
attempt
to
negotiate
a
peace
deal
with
members
of
the
islamic
militant
group
at
camp
david
in
maryland
who
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
meet
with
taliban
leaders
who
have
the
blood
of
thousands
of
americans
on
their
hands
just
days
before
wallace
asked
pompeo
the
secretary
of
state
said
the
white
house
had
reflected
on
the
history
of
camp
david
and
felt
it
was
perfectly
appropriate
to
extend
the
invitation
to
the
taliban
leadership
the
taliban
an
islamic
militant
group
in
afghanistan
recently
reiterated
its
support
for
the
attacks
president
trump
ultimately
made
the
decision
pompeo
said
of
the
camp
david
invite
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
i
want
to
talk
to
these
taliban
negotiators
i
want
to
look
them
in
the
eye
lots
of
bad
folks
have
come
through
that
place
he
added
referring
to
camp
david
there's
been
lots
of
peace
negotiations
taking
place
it's
almost
always
the
case
that
you
don't
get
to
negotiate
with
good
guys
the
president
on
saturday
announced
that
peace
negotiations
between
the
u.s.
and
the
taliban
were
on
hold
indefinitely
after
the
group
claimed
responsibility
for
a
car
bombing
in
kabul
that
killed
people
including
a
u.s.
soldier
last
week
trump
said
in
a
series
of
tweets
that
he
had
secretly
invited
taliban
leaders
to
meet
with
him
at
camp
david
but
that
he
had
canceled
the
meeting
after
the
group
admitted
to
carrying
out
the
attack
the
invitation
drew
backlash
from
democrats
and
some
members
of
the
media
the
taliban
had
the
deaths
of
thousands
of
americans
and
it's
just
three
days
before
no
concerns
about
that
wallace
asked
pompeo
on
sunday
i
can
understand
the
envoy
talking
to
them
why
does
the
president
have
to
confer
that
status
on
them
pompeo
claimed
trump
was
very
clear
about
wanting
to
make
sure
negotiations
with
the
taliban
got
to
the
right
place
trump
is
willing
to
take
risks
if
he
believes
he
can
deliver
a
good
outcome
for
the
american
people
he
said
we've
got
to
make
sure
we
get
it
right
