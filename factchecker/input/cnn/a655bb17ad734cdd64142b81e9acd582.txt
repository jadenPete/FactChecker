question
cnn
turns
out
there's
at
least
one
area
where
massachusetts
sen

warren
and
president
donald
trump
are
in
sync
making
hearing
aids
more
affordable
appearing
on
the
late
show
with
stephen
colbert
tuesday
night
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
was
asked
if
she
agrees
with
the
president
on
anything
after
a
long
pause
she
found
one
issue
yes
yes
he
signed
my
bill
into
law
that
is
going
to
bring
down
the
cost
of
hearing
aids
for
millions
of
people
across
this
country
she
told
colbert
elizabeth
warren
took
selfies
for
hours
after
her
new
york
rally
it's
part
of
her
plan
here's
what
warren
was
talking
about
trump
signed
warren's
over-the-counter
hearing
aid
act
of
which
aims
to
make
hearing
aids
more
affordable
and
had
bipartisan
support
it
requires
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
allow
certain
hearing
aids
to
be
sold
over-the-counter
to
americans
with
mild
to
moderate
hearing
loss
this
law
will
make
a
life
changing
difference
for
millions
of
americans
who
experience
hearing
loss
but
can't
access
the
hearing
aid
technology
they
need
because
of
high
costs
and
excessive
regulations
warren
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
of
the
president's
signing
medicare
and
most
private
insurance
plans
don't
cover
hearing
aids
which
can
cost
on
average
out-of-pocket
for
a
single
device
according
to
warren
about
million
americans
experience
hearing
loss
as
they
grow
older
but
only
a
small
share
of
them
about
use
the
devices
mainly
because
of
their
price
warren
said
what
medicare
for
all
would
mean
for
the
million
people
already
on
medicare
the
legislation
was
part
of
the
fda
reauthorization
act
of
warren
now
supports
medicare
for
all
which
would
create
a
government-run
health
insurance
plan
that
would
cover
hearing
aids
for
all
those
who
need
them
with
no
out-of-pocket
cost
the
bill
is
sponsored
by
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
who
is
also
seeking
the
democratic
nomination
he
frequently
cites
the
expansion
of
coverage
to
hearing
aids
as
well
as
vision
and
dental
benefits
as
ways
that
his
legislation
would
improve
medicare
for
senior
citizens
