democrats
are
already
botching
the
impeachment
fight
cnn
on
thursday
morning
the
house
judiciary
committee
voted
to
formally
establish
the
rules
of
an
impeachment
investigation
into
president
donald
trump
which
means
what
exactly
that
depends
on
who
you
ask
we're
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
into
the
culture
of
corruption
abuse
of
power
and
obstruction
of
justice
said
house
democratic
caucus
chairman
hakeem
jeffries
new
york
after
the
vote
less
than
hours
earlier
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
maryland
had
flatly
rejected
the
idea
that
the
vote
was
tantamount
to
an
impeachment
inquiry
before
having
to
walk
that
back
via
a
remarkable
bit
of
word
salad-ry
speaker
nancy
pelosi
california
speaking
after
the
vote
pointedly
refused
to
use
the
word
impeachment
in
reference
to
the
vote
i
support
what
is
happening
in
the
judiciary
committee
that
enables
them
to
do
their
process
of
interrogation
and
their
investigation
and
i
salute
them
for
that
work
she
said
asked
if
she
is
uncomfortable
with
the
term
impeachment
inquiry
and
if
people
should
be
using
a
different
term
pelosi
became
visibly
frustrated
we
are
on
our
path
where
it
takes
us
is
where
the
we
will
follow
the
facts
pelosi
said
nadler
himself
wants
to
be
done
with
labels
entirely
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
he
said
thursday
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
sidebar
is
that
a
sneaky
big
lebowski
reference
by
nadler
like
i
said
different
strokes
for
different
folks
which
is
bad
news
for
democratic
messaging
the
politics
of
impeachment
are
debatable
tweeted
former
obama
white
house
senior
adviser
dan
pfeiffer
maybe
they
are
good
maybe
they
aren't
no
one
knows
but
i
do
know
that
the
current
democratic
strategy
of
telling
the
base
they
are
impeaching
trump
and
telling
the
moderates
the
opposite
is
an
absolute
disaster
that
about
sums
it
up
speaking
of
strokes
think
of
it
another
way
if
you've
ever
played
tennis
you
know
that
one
of
the
first
rules
you
learn
is
to
not
get
caught
in
no
man's
land
the
area
between
the
net
and
the
baseline
why
because
the
ball
will
be
forever
bouncing
right
at
your
feet
making
it
very
tough
to
return
it
with
any
sort
of
consistency
you
need
to
commit
to
the
net
or
commit
to
the
baseline
don't
get
caught
in
between
no
man's
land
is
right
where
democrats
find
themselves
on
impeachment
at
the
moment
both
on
the
semantics
of
whether
to
use
the
word
impeachment
and
on
the
broader
question
of
whether
it
makes
sense
politically
and
otherwise
for
democrats
to
pursue
impeachment
against
trump
in
fact
the
fight
over
what
to
call
what
happened
thursday
in
the
judiciary
committee
reflects
the
overall
uncertainty
among
democrats
pelosi
has
been
a
leading
voice
in
the
wait-and-see
camp
back
in
march
she
told
the
washington
post
this
impeachment
is
so
divisive
to
the
country
that
unless
there's
something
so
compelling
and
overwhelming
and
bipartisan
i
don't
think
we
should
go
down
that
path
because
it
divides
the
country
and
he's
just
not
worth
it
and
she
hasn't
diverted
from
that
path
even
as
a
majority
of
her
caucus
now
support
open
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
again
is
that
what
happened
on
thursday
it's
not
totally
clear
to
me
or
well
most
everyone
else
liberals
within
the
democratic
caucus
have
grown
more
and
more
vocal
in
their
desire
to
see
trump
impeached
or
at
least
the
process
begun
to
make
that
happen
the
problem
for
pelosi
and
house
democrats
more
generally
is
this
a
majority
of
the
country
opposes
impeachment
even
as
the
party's
base
strongly
supports
it
in
a
recent
monmouth
university
poll
in
people
said
they
opposed
impeaching
trump
a
smaller
majority
said
that
nadler
opening
an
impeachment
inquiry
is
a
bad
idea
but
the
same
poll
showed
in
self-identified
democrats
favor
both
impeaching
trump
and
nadler
opening
an
investigation
to
do
that
rock
meet
hard
place
which
is
why
democrats
find
themselves
at
sixes
and
sevens
when
it
comes
to
even
talking
about
whether
or
not
what
happened
thursday
morning
was
formalizing
an
impeachment
inquiry
where
the
party
is
on
impeachment
is
totally
unsustainable
sort
of
kind
of
impeaching
the
president
makes
no
one
happy
pick
a
position
and
a
message
and
go
with
it
or
run
the
risk
of
spending
the
next
year
trying
to
return
tennis
balls
slammed
directly
at
your
feet
