omar
an
administration
that
lies
about
weather
maps
can't
be
trusted
on
iran
washington
cnn
rep
ilhan
omar
on
monday
dismissed
president
donald
trump's
ability
to
navigate
escalating
tensions
with
iran
pointing
to
the
controversy
over
hurricane
dorian's
path
and
whether
it
would
hit
alabama
congress
has
the
constitutional
right
to
declare
war
the
president
doesn't
have
it
the
secretary
of
state
doesn't
it
have
and
saudi
arabia
certainly
doesn't
have
it
omar
a
minnesota
democrat
told
cnn's
erin
burnett
on
outfront
i
think
we
need
to
make
sure
that
the
american
people
understand
that
this
administration
that
lies
about
weather
maps
or
crowd
sizes
cannot
be
trusted
to
give
us
the
full
information
we
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
decision
whether
we
should
be
going
to
war
or
not
with
iran
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
think
about
another
endless
war
and
i
really
hope
that
my
colleagues
in
congress
are
going
to
pressure
this
administration
to
take
a
step
back
and
figure
out
how
we
use
diplomacy
in
the
de-escalating
the
situation
she
added
rep
ilhan
omar
hopes
israel
will
break
from
netanyahu
omar's
invocation
of
past
trump
administration
falsehoods
comes
after
trump
told
reporters
monday
that
it's
looking
like
iran
was
behind
this
weekend's
attack
on
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
but
suggested
it
was
too
early
to
say
for
sure
the
freshman
democrat
was
specifically
referencing
trump's
multiple
false
claims
that
hurricane
dorian
was
likely
to
hit
alabama
and
a
controversy
from
just
after
his
inauguration
in
when
then-white
house
press
secretary
sean
spicer
said
trump's
inauguration
crowd
was
the
largest
ever
in
contradiction
to
all
available
data
trump
said
monday
he
was
not
looking
to
get
into
new
conflict
but
sometimes
you
have
to
on
sunday
night
trump
tweeted
that
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
a
refrain
that
marc
short
the
vice
president's
chief
of
staff
told
reporters
monday
morning
may
not
refer
to
military
action
i
think
that
locked
and
loaded
is
a
broad
term
and
talks
about
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
short
said
as
trump
gears
up
for
a
reelection
battle
a
notable
lack
of
public
trust
in
information
coming
from
the
white
house
such
as
the
falsehoods
omar
referenced
continue
to
dog
his
administration
a
cnn
ssrs
poll
released
last
week
shows
that
overall
say
they
trust
only
some
or
nothing
at
all
of
what
they
hear
from
official
white
house
communications
about
the
same
as
the
who
felt
that
way
in
late
