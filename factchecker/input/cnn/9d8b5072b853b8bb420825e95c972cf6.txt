could

we

cnn
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
of
texas
has
made
his
position
on
assault
weapons
crystal
clear
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
o'rourke
said
during
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
to
accomplish
this
o'rourke
has
proposed
a
mandatory
confiscation
of
these
guns
whereby
individuals
would
be
compensated
for
their
firearms
beyond
the
thorny
politics
of
this
proposal
it
raises
clear
legal
and
logistical
questions
including
whether
a
president
has
the
authority
to
confiscate
people's
guns
facts
first
a
president
could
not
issue
a
blanket
confiscation
of
so-called
assault
weapons
but
they
could
work
with
congress
to
pass
such
a
law
constitutionally
speaking
that
law
would
likely
run
into
some
significant
legal
trouble
first
some
basic
facts
the
national
rifle
association
has
estimated
that
there
are
somewhere
between
million
and
million
assault
rifles
in
the
us
the
organization
told
mcclatchy
in
that's
about
to
of
all
the
estimated
guns
in
the
us
but
it's
unclear
how
many
guns
would
ultimately
fall
under
an
assault
weapons
confiscation
part
of
that
has
to
do
with
the
fuzzy
definition
of
what
qualifies
as
an
assault
weapon
which
can
sometimes
be
based
on
cosmetic
features
like
a
folding
stock
or
an
additional
handgrip
on
a
rifle
in
assault
weapons
were
banned
from
being
manufactured
but
the
law
did
not
call
for
the
confiscation
of
those
already
in
private
ownership
that
assault
weapons
ban
expired
in
and
was
not
renewed
under
the
george
w.
bush
administration
o'rourke's
plan
however
not
only
would
include
a
ban
on
all
sales
of
so-called
assault
weapons
but
also
would
require
owners
to
sell
these
guns
to
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
something
the
us
government
has
never
done
before
because
of
precedent
set
by
the
supreme
court
the
widespread
use
and
popularity
of
these
guns
would
almost
certainly
present
legal
trouble
for
o'rourke's
proposal
in
the
case
district
of
columbia
v
heller
the
supreme
court
ruled
on
whether
a
ban
on
handgun
possession
in
the
home
violated
the
second
amendment
it
found
that
it
did
holding
that
the
second
amendment
protects
guns
that
are
in
common
use
and
prohibits
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons
in
response
to
questions
about
the
constitutionality
of
his
proposal
o'rourke's
campaign
told
cnn
that
the
confiscation
of
ar-
style
weapons
would
be
legal
and
cited
justice
antonin
scalia's
opinion
from
heller
that
the
regulation
of
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons
does
not
violate
the
second
amendment
however
scalia's
opinion
states
that
the
second
amendment
protects
guns
in
common
use
given
their
prevalence
these
assault
weapons
could
fall
under
the
definition
of
being
in
common
use
and
therefore
be
protected
by
the
second
amendment
at
least
one
expert
believes
that
common
use
interpretation
would
carry
the
day
there's
no
dispute
that
these
guns
meet
that
definition
