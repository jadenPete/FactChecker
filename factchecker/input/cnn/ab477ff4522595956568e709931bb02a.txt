the

of
the
association
of

attendants-cwa
said
the

shows
a
pervasive
problem

that
airlines
need
additional

prevent
issues
from
spilling
onto

only
be
calculated

not
publish

recommendations
but
said
some
experts
believed
more
law
enforcement
resources
or
additional
employee
training
would
be
beneficial
