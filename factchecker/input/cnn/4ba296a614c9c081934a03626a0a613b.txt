no
clear
movement
toward
a
meeting
between
trump
and
iranian
president
in
new
york
cnn
even
though
president
donald
trump
says
iran
wants
to
meet
there
is
little
to
suggest
that
there
is
behind
the
scenes
movement
toward
any
meeting
between
trump
and
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
coming
to
fruition
there
have
been
discussions
at
the
white
house
about
easing
iranian
sanctions
or
providing
the
waivers
needed
to
implement
the
french
idea
of
getting
cash
to
flow
into
iran
both
of
which
could
be
done
in
an
effort
to
pave
the
way
for
a
trump-rouhani
meeting
according
to
two
administration
officials
that
said
nothing
has
been
decided
the
treasury
department
has
not
started
to
draft
a
plan
to
wind
down
the
iran
sanctions
or
create
carve-outs
for
the
billion
french
bailout
plan
at
the
request
of
the
white
house
two
other
sources
say
on
thursday
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
disputed
the
reports
that
the
administration
was
considering
easing
sanctions
that
would
allow
the
billion
bailout
we've
had
direct
conversations
with
president
macron
and
bruno
le
maire
the
finance
minister
and
they
absolutely
understand
they
would
need
waivers
from
the
us
to
do
that
and
that
is
not
something
we're
contemplating
at
the
moment
mnuchin
told
reporters
mnuchin
added
that
there
are
no
plans
for
trump
to
meet
with
rouhani
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
later
this
month
but
he
reiterated
the
president
has
said
he
would
be
open
to
meeting
with
no
conditions
a
day
earlier
trump
was
asked
by
a
reporter
in
the
oval
office
if
he
would
consider
easing
sanctions
to
make
a
meeting
happen
we'll
see
what
happens
we'll
see
what
happens
trump
replied
i
can
tell
you
iran
wants
to
meet
trump
said
on
thursday
but
it
is
unclear
if
he
was
referencing
any
new
us-iranian
dialogue
rouhani
has
maintained
that
he
would
not
talk
with
the
us
until
washington
lifts
sanctions
despite
trump's
comments
the
islamic
republic
says
they
have
not
changed
their
minds
and
decided
they
want
a
face-to-face
meeting
with
trump
there
is
no
meeting
envisaged
between
the
two
presidents
during
unga
week
alireza
miryousefi
the
spokesperson
at
the
iranian
mission
to
the
un
told
cnn
there
are
at
least
five
americans
detained
in
iran
and
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
say
there
has
been
no
substantial
progress
recently
towards
securing
their
release
earlier
this
year
iranian
foreign
minister
javad
zarif
said
he
had
offered
to
negotiate
a
prisoner
exchange
but
had
not
heard
back
from
the
trump
administration
but
the
us
has
made
a
concerted
effort
to
reach
out
to
the
iranians
and
at
one
point
even
made
an
offer
that
was
turned
down
according
to
an
administration
official
given
the
stagnant
situation
on
multiple
fronts
both
on
the
easing
of
sanctions
and
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
iran
continually
saying
it
will
not
meet
with
trump
it
remains
unclear
how
the
trump
administration
could
get
the
iranians
to
agree
to
a
meeting
at
the
end
of
this
month
during
the
general
assembly
