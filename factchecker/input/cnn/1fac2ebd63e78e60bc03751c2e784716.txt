voters
don't
like
no
shot
campaigns
just
ask
bill
de
blasio
cnn
when
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
declared
his
presidential
candidacy
in
may
he
was
derided
by
many
in
the
media
yet
he
was
a
politician
who
could
point
out
that
his
constituents
liked
him
even
if
the
media
didn't
four
months
later
de
blasio's
presidential
campaign
is
going
nowhere
worse
new
york
city
voters
seem
to
be
punishing
him
for
a
campaign
they
didn't
want
him
to
run
de
blasio's
popularity
among
new
york
city
voters
is
the
worst
it's
ever
been
siena
college
polled
new
york
state
voters
and
provided
a
substantial
crosstab
of
new
york
city
voters
according
to
this
poll
just
of
new
york
city
voters
say
they
have
a
favorable
rating
of
de
blasio
his
unfavorable
rating
has
climbed
to
this
makes
for
a
net
favorability
rating
of
points
he
earned
of
the
vote
among
democratic
voters
in
a
potential
presidential
primary
crosstabs
of
course
have
margins
of
error
but
the
trendline
here
is
unmistakable
de
blasio's
net
favorability
rating
had
never
dropped
below
points
before
may
in
any
quinnipiac
university
or
siena
polling
crosstab
of
new
york
city
voters
in
an
average
of
polls
taken
since
he
was
first
elected
de
blasio
averaged
a
point
net
favorability
rating
he
would
sometimes
get
into
the
mid
to
high
s
or
above
since
de
blasio
started
running
for
president
his
net
favorability
has
been
below
points
in
all
three
siena
polls
conducted
he's
gone
from
points
in
june
to
points
in
late
july
early
august
to
points
today
it
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
de
blasio's
losing
steam
with
his
constituents
the
vast
majority
told
quinnipiac
pollsters
in
the
early
spring
that
they
didn't
want
him
to
run
for
president
in
doing
so
de
blasio
was
away
from
the
city
for
numerous
events
most
notably
he
was
in
iowa
during
a
power
outage
presidential
campaigns
don't
necessarily
make
a
candidate
less
popular
at
home
after
he
lost
the
gop
primary
former
arizona
sen
john
mccain
won
three
senate
elections
two
of
which
happened
after
he
won
the
republican
presidential
nomination
and
lost
the
race
to
barack
obama
and
former
massachusetts
sen
john
kerry
won
another
senate
term
in
after
losing
his
presidential
bid
to
george
w.
bush
in
campaigns
in
which
candidates
press
on
despite
seemingly
having
no
chance
can
be
another
matter
former
connecticut
sen
chris
dodd
was
once
quite
popular
in
his
home
state
quinnipiac
regularly
pegged
his
approval
rating
in
the
high
s
to
mid
s
then
dodd
decided
to
run
for
president
and
move
his
family
to
iowa
in
even
though
he
rarely
broke
low
single
digits
in
caucuses
and
primary
polling
his
approval
dropped
to
in
the
first
poll
taken
after
his
bid
ended
and
kept
on
dropping
following
a
senate
investigation
on
mortgages
he
received
he
was
cleared
in
that
investigation
but
the
totality
of
it
all
finished
off
dodd
he
ended
up
not
running
for
another
senate
term
other
candidates
in
the
field
seem
to
be
realizing
that
sometimes
it's
best
to
go
home
when
you
have
little
chance
of
winning
california
rep
eric
swalwell
and
massachusetts
rep
seth
moulton
called
it
quits
to
run
for
another
house
term
in
new
york
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
left
the
race
too
like
de
blasio
she's
recording
record
high
unfavorable
ratings
in
new
york
the
bottom
line
is
this
voters
seem
more
than
willing
to
allow
their
politicians
to
leave
their
day
jobs
to
run
for
higher
office
but
as
the
de
blasio
saga
illustrates
voters
don't
want
their
politicians
going
on
vanity
missions
they
want
them
concentrating
on
the
job
they
were
elected
to
do
