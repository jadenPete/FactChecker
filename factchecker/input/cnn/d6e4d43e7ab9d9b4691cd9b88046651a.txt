can
beto
o'rourke
swear
his
way
to
relevance
cnn
beto
o'rourke
just
can't
stop
swearing
when
candidates
say
at
least
donald
trump
and
mitch
mcconnell
are
pretending
to
be
interested
s
that
is
not
enough
the
former
texas
congressman
and
aspirant
wrote
on
twitter
sunday
neither
is
poll-testing
your
message
gun
violence
is
a
life
or
death
issue
and
we
have
to
represent
the
bold
ideas
of
people
all
over
the
country
that
comment
comes
hard
on
a
cadre
of
cursing
by
o'rourke
in
the
wake
of
a
series
of
mass
shootings
in
recent
months
following
the
murders
of
more
than
people
in
el
paso
in
a
shooting
apparently
motivated
by
hatred
of
hispanics
o'rourke
was
asked
by
a
reporter
whether
he
thought
president
donald
trump
bore
some
responsibility
for
the
deaths
and
he
said
this
what
do
you
think
you
know
the
s
he
has
been
saying
he's
been
calling
mexican
immigrants
rapists
and
criminals
i
mean
members
of
the
press
what
the
f
then
after
another
mass
shooting
in
west
texas
o'rourke
doubled
down
not
sure
how
many
gunmen
not
sure
how
many
people
have
been
shot
he
told
a
crowd
in
virginia
don't
know
how
many
people
have
been
killed
the
condition
of
those
who
have
survived
don't
know
what
the
motivation
is
do
not
yet
know
the
firearms
that
were
used
or
how
they
acquired
them
but
we
do
know
that
this
is
f
ed
up
and
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
dana
bash
the
following
day
o'rourke
did
it
again
a
hundred
killed
daily
in
the
united
states
of
america
we're
averaging
about
mass
shootings
a
year
no
other
country
comes
close
so
yes
this
is
f
ed
up
o'rourke
said
o'rourke's
profanity
has
been
so
pronounced
that
in
advance
of
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
in
houston
last
week
abc
and
the
democratic
national
committee
sent
an
email
to
the
candidates
and
their
campaigns
with
a
simple
message
don't
curse
we
will
not
be
broadcasting
on
any
delay
so
there
will
be
no
opportunity
to
edit
out
foul
language
read
the
email
candidates
should
therefore
avoid
cursing
or
expletives
in
accordance
with
federal
law
and
fcc
guidelines
o'rourke
managed
not
to
swear
during
the
debate
while
beto
seems
to
be
leading
the
cursing
charge
he's
far
from
alone
president
trump
himself
regularly
peppers
his
campaign
stump
speech
with
the
word
bullsh
since
he
took
office
trump
derisively
referred
to
immigrants
from
el
salvador
and
africa
as
hailing
from
s-hole
countries
and
let's
not
forget
how
trump
described
his
own
behavior
during
an
access
hollywood
interview
in
that
emerged
in
the
final
days
of
the
race
sidebar
trump
often
takes
issue
with
the
use
of
profanity
by
his
political
opponents
and
their
allies
trump
referred
to
model
chrissy
teigen
as
musician
john
legend's
filthy
mouthed
wife
on
twitter
in
september
attacking
the
squad
four
freshman
democratic
congresswomen
of
color
trump
tweeted
this
in
july
this
should
be
a
vote
on
the
filthy
language
statements
and
lies
told
by
the
democrat
congresswomen
who
i
truly
believe
based
on
their
actions
hate
our
country
you
get
the
idea
in
fact
according
to
govpredict
a
public
affairs
company
swearing
by
all
politicians
those
running
for
president
and
those
who
aren't
has
soared
in
as
of
september
lawmakers
have
sworn
and
i
am
not
talking
about
darn
more
than
times
on
twitter
so
far
this
year
that's
almost
times
as
many
curses
as
the
govpredict
counted
from
lawmakers
in
all
of
so
why
all
the
profanity
i
have
two
theories
the
campaign
and
trump's
victory
fully
ushered
in
the
reality
tv
age
of
american
politics
politicians
have
been
swearing
behind
closed
doors
since
well
we've
had
politics
one
notable
exception
george
washington
the
first
president
put
out
a
general
order
during
the
revolutionary
war
condemning
the
foolish
and
wicked
practice
of
profane
cursing
and
swearing
but
what
trump
did
is
take
the
private
personas
of
politicians
and
make
them
public
he
made
it
ok
to
be
exactly
what
you
are
at
all
times
and
that
includes
swearing
it's
hard
to
break
through
in
this
political
climate
one
of
the
last
tools
for
a
politician
to
do
so
is
to
curse
because
people
are
still
so
unused
to
hearing
politicians
cuss
they
tend
to
sit
up
and
pay
attention
in
ways
that
they
might
not
otherwise
swearing
is
also
seen
as
an
authentic
expression
of
emotion
something
all
politicians
in
this
day
and
age
are
going
for
imagine
o'rourke
saying
after
the
latest
mass
shooting
this
is
messed
up
not
exactly
the
same
power
right
what
o'rourke
is
trying
to
do
by
leaning
into
his
cursing
not
to
mention
his
support
of
a
mandatory
buyback
program
for
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
is
send
a
very
clear
signal
that
on
this
issue
the
status
quo
is
no
longer
enough
that
simply
advocating
for
new
policies
or
offering
hopes
and
prayers
or
even
condemning
opponents
of
more
gun
control
using
traditional
accepted
political
rhetoric
is
unsuitable
for
the
depth
breadth
and
seriousness
that
the
plague
of
mass
shootings
poses
to
our
culture
will
it
work
honestly
who
the
hell
knows
