steven
menashi
president
donald
trump's
nominee
for
the
nd
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
at
his
confirmation
hearing
that
he
regretted
if
his
writings
for
dartmouth's
conservative
student
newspaper
had
been
overheated
or
extreme
in
advancing
his
arguments
menashi
a
white
house
aide
was
responding
to
a
question
from
democratic
sen
sheldon
whitehouse
of
rhode
island
on
wednesday
about
an
editorial
he
had
written
in
march
on
the
human
rights
campaign
and
identity
politics
which
compared
college
applications
listing
race
to
the
nuremberg
laws
created
in
to
segregate
jews
in
germany
cnn's
kfile
first
reported
on
the
editorial
last
month
so
senator
that
has
come
up
menashi
said
it's
something
that
i
have
wrote
in
college
let
me
be
clear
there
is
no
comparison
to
be
made
between
the
nuremberg
laws
and
any
activity
that
goes
on
on
a
college
campus
i
did
not
believe
that
years
ago
when
i
wrote
something
in
college
and
i
don't
believe
that
today
some
of
the
writings
i
did
in
college
were
writing
from
the
perspective
that
i
thought
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
treat
people
as
members
of
groups
rather
than
individuals
menashi
added
which
was
important
to
me
because
my
family
had
suffered
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
group
status
and
if
some
of
the
writing
was
overheated
or
extreme
in
advancing
that
view
i
regret
that
implication
but
let
me
be
clear
he
said
i
did
not
believe
then
and
i
do
not
believe
now
that
there
is
any
comparison
to
be
drawn
between
the
nuremberg
laws
and
anything
that
happens
on
a
contemporary
college
campus
cnn's
kfile
first
reported
in
august
that
menashi
a
year-old
white
house
aide
had
written
editorials
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
while
a
student
at
dartmouth
that
criticized
women's
marches
against
sexual
assault
dismissed
education
about
multicultural
awareness
and
accused
a
major
lgbtq
group
of
exploiting
the
brutal
murder
of
a
gay
student
for
political
ends
identity
politics
subsumes
individuals
in
a
tribal
unit
and
defines
them
not
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
or
mind
but
according
to
the
historical
circumstances
of
the
tribe
and
its
relationship
to
actual
or
would-be
oppressors
wrote
menashi
in
elite
institutions
generally
nourish
the
disposition
sixty
years
after
the
promulgation
of
the
nuremberg
laws
universities
persist
in
cataloguing
students
according
to
race
on
college
applications
and
official
documents
and
our
cultural
and
political
beliefs
are
said
to
be
a
function
of
our
bloodlines
what
a
subversion
of
the
liberation
of
mind
promised
by
education
senators
criticized
menashi
for
his
past
writings
at
his
hearing
and
protests
against
his
confirmation
could
be
heard
during
his
opening
statement
