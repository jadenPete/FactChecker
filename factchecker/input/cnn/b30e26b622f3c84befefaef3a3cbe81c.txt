takeaways
from
the
new
book
about
brett
kavanaugh
revisit
the
ford
and
kavanaugh
testimonies
washington
cnn
robin
pogrebin
and
kate
kelly
dropped
a
political
bombshell
on
washington
when
they
published
an
excerpt
of
their
book
on
brett
kavanaugh
describing
an
additional
incident
from
the
supreme
court
justice's
time
at
yale
in
the
s
that
didn't
come
out
during
his
contentious
confirmation
hearings
last
year
the
book
the
education
of
brett
kavanaugh
also
details
the
allegations
from
deborah
ramirez
another
yale
classmate
and
raises
new
questions
about
the
actions
of
senators
and
the
fbi
before
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
last
october
kavanaugh
has
publicly
denied
all
allegations
against
him
through
a
supreme
court
spokesperson
he
has
declined
to
comment
on
the
book
cnn
purchased
a
copy
of
the
book
ahead
of
its
official
release
here
are
five
takeaways
what
did
the
fbi
do
or
not
do
at
the
heart
of
the
book's
impact
is
the
idea
that
allegations
against
kavanaugh
were
not
thoroughly
investigated
as
the
gop-led
senate
worked
quickly
to
confirm
him
after
the
hearings
in
which
christine
blasey
ford
accused
kavanaugh
of
sexual
assault
during
their
high
school
years
and
kavanaugh's
fiery
denials
republicans
were
ready
to
push
through
the
nomination
eventually
the
fbi
was
asked
to
take
a
week
and
look
into
the
allegations
against
kavanaugh
democrats
at
the
time
complained
the
investigation
was
limited
and
pogrebin
and
kelly
seem
to
concur
several
people
wanted
to
speak
to
the
fbi
or
senate
judiciary
committee
about
an
incident
at
yale
involving
kavanaugh
and
ramirez
in
which
he
allegedly
exposed
his
penis
at
a
party
one
former
kavanaugh
schoolmate
mark
krasberg
contacted
three
different
senate
offices
an
fbi
field
office
and
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
order
to
convey
his
information
but
he
was
passed
around
cut
short
or
ignored
until
the
final
hours
of
the
inquiry
on
october
the
book
states
fellow
former
yale
student
ken
appold
reported
a
similar
issue
being
passed
around
from
email
to
an
number
to
an
online
form
and
never
heard
from
the
fbi
i
wasn't
surprised
the
investigative
powers
of
the
fbi
were
too
limited
it
wasn't
part
of
their
mandate
to
do
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
appold
said
according
to
the
book
if
they
had
interviewed
me
i
would
have
been
happy
to
cooperate
a
third
yale
classmate
kathleen
charlton
also
tried
in
vain
to
reach
the
fbi
the
authors
write
the
fbi
declined
to
comment
on
the
book
to
cnn
a
new
incident
the
offices
of
at
least
two
senators
on
the
judiciary
committee
learned
that
a
kavanaugh
classmate
max
stier
had
witnessed
kavanaugh
engage
in
a
similar
incident
to
the
ramirez
allegations
stier
relayed
his
recollections
to
senators
during
the
confirmation
process
and
later
made
clear
his
willingness
to
share
them
with
the
fbi
but
he
refused
to
speak
about
them
publicly
the
book
states
why
brett
kavanaugh
isn't
going
anywhere
it
is
unclear
how
much
the
fbi
looked
into
the
incident
if
at
all
on
october
delaware
democratic
sen
chris
coons
asked
the
fbi
to
speak
to
more
people
and
singled
out
stier
cnn
reported
the
story
made
its
way
to
the
fbi
but
was
never
investigated
the
book
states
cnn
is
not
reporting
details
of
the
accusation
and
has
not
independently
corroborated
the
account
the
female
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
by
the
book's
authors
and
her
friends
told
the
authors
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
stier
declined
a
request
to
comment
from
cnn
keyser
couldn't
recall
alleged
ford
incident
the
book
provides
extended
quotes
from
leyland
keyser
the
woman
whom
ford
told
senators
attended
a
small
gathering
at
a
maryland
house
on
the
night
of
the
alleged
incident
with
kavanaugh
before
last
year's
hearings
a
lawyer
for
keyser
said
in
a
statement
that
his
client
had
no
recollection
of
ever
being
at
a
party
or
gathering
when
kavanaugh
was
present
with
or
without
dr
ford
at
the
hearing
itself
ford
testified
that
keyser
has
significant
health
challenges
that
she
was
glad
that
she's
taking
care
of
herself
ford
told
the
senators
that
she
didn't
expect
leland
would
remember
the
evening
saying
it
was
a
very
unremarkable
party
the
authors
note
in
the
book
that
since
high
school
keyser
had
been
derailed
by
a
multitude
of
ailments
undergoing
numerous
back
surgeries
a
knee
replacement
and
other
treatments
leaving
her
unable
to
work
a
mayo
clinic
chronic-pain
program
helped
but
she
still
had
many
bad
days
in
the
book
keyser
is
quoted
as
saying
that
after
a
second
meeting
with
fbi
agents
her
overall
posture
toward
ford's
account
was
that
i
just
really
didn't
have
confidence
in
the
story
according
to
the
book
she
had
had
second
thoughts
since
her
initial
interview
four
days
earlier
with
the
fbi
when
she
said
she
couldn't
recall
the
event
ford
described
the
more
keyser
thought
about
it
the
more
dubious
she
was
about
ford's
account
the
book
states
noting
that
aspects
didn't
ring
true
to
her
those
included
that
she
didn't
remember
hanging
out
with
people
who
went
to
georgetown
prep
as
much
as
my
friends
think
and
that
even
after
reviewing
pictures
she
did
not
know
kavanaugh
exclusive
how
john
roberts
killed
the
census
citizenship
question
the
book
says
that
keyser
gave
investigators
her
whole
history
of
using
i
told
the
fbi
about
myself
she
said
basically
everything
i've
ever
done
in
my
life
according
to
the
book
keyser
said
that
she
had
her
own
history
with
drugs
and
alcohol
but
that
she
was
not
a
heavy
drinker
at
that
point
in
high
school
keyser
told
the
authors
about
ford
i
think
something
happened
but
i
don't
know
what
and
i
haven't
been
close
enough
to
her
over
the
years
to
know
that
something
went
down
i
haven't
seen
her
in
a
long
long
time
i
do
think
that
something
happened
to
her
and
that
maybe
she
is
a
victim
of
some
sort
of
trauma
but
keyser
holds
firm
to
her
lack
of
confidence
in
the
specifics
of
the
kavanaugh
account
those
facts
together
i
don't
recollect
and
it
just
didn't
make
any
sense
the
book
notes
that
months
after
kavanaugh
was
already
sitting
on
the
court
a
copy
of
a
national
review
article
on
his
confirmation
hung
framed
in
keyser's
bathroom
dated
october
it
bore
the
headline
was
leyland
keyser
the
hero
of
the
kavanaugh
controversy
pogrebin
and
kelly
say
that
keyser
continued
to
appear
perturbed
by
her
unexpected
role
in
the
confirmation
battle
several
months
later
in
a
text
message
to
one
of
the
authors
in
march
keyser
said
that
she
believed
she
was
being
surveilled
at
home
possibly
by
people
related
to
the
kavanaugh
matter
ramirez's
story
ramirez
was
the
second
person
after
ford
to
publicly
raise
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
against
kavanaugh
the
former
yale
student's
account
was
first
published
by
the
new
yorker
last
september
and
ramirez
goes
into
additional
detail
in
the
new
book
about
the
incident
in
a
dorm
common
area
during
the
drinking
game
ramirez
said
the
guys
kept
picking
her
to
drink
more
and
she
became
inebriated
at
one
point
someone
strapped
on
a
fake
penis
and
pointed
it
at
her
the
book
states
then
later
ramirez
said
she
had
a
penis
thrust
in
her
face
she
remembered
pushing
it
away
saying
that's
not
a
real
penis
but
this
penis
was
real
she
would
recall
she
had
accidentally
touched
one
for
the
first
time
the
book
adds
it
was
something
she
hadn't
planned
to
do
until
she
was
married
ramirez
says
she
remembered
kavanaugh
pulling
up
his
pants
looking
puffed
up
like
he
just
did
something
really
really
great
and
laughing
another
student
yelled
down
the
hall
brett
kavanaugh
just
put
his
penis
in
debbie's
face
when
the
story
was
made
public
last
year
kavanaugh
said
this
alleged
event
from
years
ago
did
not
happen
the
people
who
knew
me
then
know
that
this
did
not
happen
and
have
said
so
this
is
a
smear
plain
and
simple
fellow
former
yale
student
appold
said
however
that
people
at
the
time
were
talking
about
the
incident
recalling
that
another
student
said
he
had
witnessed
it
toobin
book
implies
kavanaugh
investigation
was
a
joke
the
kavanaugh
fight
will
never
truly
end
the
book
is
a
chance
for
everyone
to
relitigate
the
kavanaugh
nomination
the
deep
feelings
from
the
hearing
have
not
gone
away
and
likely
will
never
go
away
for
good
by
allowing
no
possibility
that
he
had
ever
assaulted
anyone
including
ford
or
exposed
his
penis
to
ramirez
kavanaugh
may
have
boxed
himself
into
a
lie
pogrebin
and
kelly
write
but
that's
the
case
only
if
he
knowingly
uttered
a
falsehood
by
denying
events
he
actually
did
remember
if
he
genuinely
has
no
recollection
of
them
and
no
document
friend
or
other
evidence
surfaced
he
was
not
consciously
being
dishonest
liberals
still
stinging
from
the
confirmation
of
kavanaugh
to
replace
centrist
conservative
anthony
kennedy
the
swing
vote
on
issues
such
as
abortion
and
race
on
the
supreme
court
see
additional
alleged
details
of
his
behavior
at
yale
as
evidence
he
never
should
have
been
confirmed
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
frontrunner
said
the
story
raises
profoundly
troubling
questions
about
the
integrity
of
the
confirmation
process
that
put
brett
kavanaugh
on
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
place

tweeted
that

should
start
suing

or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
for
the
president
the
kavanaugh
hearings
and
close
vote
last
year
served
as
a
political
boon
to
get
republicans
to
turn
out
in
tight
senate
races
in
red
states
and
defeat
democratic
incumbents
actually
increasing
the
gop's

margin
from
