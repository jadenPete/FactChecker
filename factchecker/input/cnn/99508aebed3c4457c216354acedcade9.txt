a
conversation
with
no
pre-conditions
we're
ready

the
american
effort
to
fundamentally
reverse

malign
activity

this
islamic
republic

august
gidley
said
on
fox
news
well
listen
he
has
been
clear
that
he
wants
to
have
conversations
with
the
leaders
of
iran
without
you
know
pre-conditions
he's
been
very
clear
about
that
and
he
was
clear
in
the
g
as
well
but
the
fact
is
iran
is
under
a
maximum
pressure
campaign
by
this
president
because
of
its
decades
worth
of
malign
behavior
september
appearing
together
at
a
press
briefing
mnuchin
and
pompeo
said
within
moments
of
each
other
that
trump
was
willing
to
meet
with
iran
with
no
pre-conditions
i
think
you
know
we've
done
more
sanctions
on
iran
than
anybody
and
it's
absolutely
working
now
the
president
has
made
clear
he
is
happy
to
take
a
meeting
with
no
pre-conditions
but
we
are
maintaining
the
maximum
pressure
campaign
said
mnuchin
when
pompeo
was
asked
if
he
could
foresee
a
meeting
between
trump
and
the
leader
of
iran
this
month
around
the
united
nations
general
assembly
pompeo
said
sure
the
president
has
made
very
clear
he
is
prepared
to
meet
with
no
pre-conditions
