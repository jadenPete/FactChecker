greta
thunberg
has
a
suggestion
for
congress
on
how
to
take
real
action
on
the
climate
crisis
greta
thunberg
to
congress
listen
to
the
scientists
cnn
greta
thunberg
has
had
a
busy
week
on
wednesday
the
swedish
year-old
climate
activist
appeared
in
front
of
congress
before
a
hearing
on
climate
change
just
days
after
she
met
with
former
president
barack
obama
thunberg
though
told
congress
she
didn't
have
any
prepared
remarks
instead
she
referred
to
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change's
special
report
on
global
warming
which
reported
a
temperature
increase
of
degrees
celsius
above
pre-industrial
levels
i
am
submitting
this
report
as
my
testimony
because
i
don't
want
you
to
listen
to
me
i
want
you
to
listen
to
the
scientists
she
said
and
i
want
you
to
unite
behind
the
science
and
then
i
want
you
to
take
real
action
strong
words
from
the
teenager
but
this
isn't
the
first
time
she's
spoken
up
to
governments
thunberg
first
made
a
name
for
herself
while
staging
weekly
sit-ins
outside
the
swedish
parliament
which
led
to
more
than
similar
protests
worldwide
thunberg
is
in
the
united
states
to
speak
at
the
united
nations
climate
action
summit
in
new
york
on
september
but
she's
had
other
things
on
her
agenda
too
including
appearing
on
the
daily
show
with
trevor
noah
in
new
york
and
receiving
amnesty
international's
top
award
in
washington
for
her
activism
but
she
didn't
travel
to
the
united
states
by
plane
to
cut
down
on
emissions
thunberg
spent
two
weeks
sailing
across
the
atlantic
on
a
zero-emissions
sailboat
that's
dedication
