trump's

washington
cnn
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
preparing
to
revoke
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
vehicle
emission
standards
a
source
familiar
with
the
plans
told
cnn
on
tuesday
the
latest
move
in
the
trump
administration's
ongoing
fight
with
the
golden
state
and
attempts
to
chip
away
at
former
president
barack
obama's
environmental
legacy
the
source
said
the
change
could
come
as
soon
as
wednesday
it's
yet
another
escalation
in
the
clash
between
california
and
trump
administration
industry
watchers
feared
that
the
trump
administration's
plan
to
freeze
federal
emission
standards
a
rollback
of
tightened
standards
created
by
the
obama
administration
could
have
led
to
two
auto
markets
in
the
us
one
subject
to
more
restrictive
california
regulations
and
another
linked
to
significantly
less
stringent
federal
standards
the
trump
administration
has
also
made
unraveling
obama's
environmental
legacy
a
priority
months
after
he
arrived
in
office
president
donald
trump
announced
the
us
would
leave
the
paris
climate
agreement
and
in
june
he
revoked
the
clean
power
plan
the
key
regulation
underpinning
the
us
pledge
in
the
landmark
international
agreement
the
administration
also
recently
revoked
obama's
waters
of
the
united
states
rule
and
has
made
number
of
other
moves
that
would
allow
for
increased
oil
and
gas
production
on
public
lands
the
source
said
the
trump
administration
will
find
the
epa
previously
acted
unlawfully
by
granting
the
state
a
waiver
from
the
clean
air
act
and
allowing
it
to
develop
stricter
standards
than
those
of
the
federal
government
about
a
dozen
states
have
adopted
california's
standards
which
are
geared
toward
the
larger
goal
of
curbing
greenhouse
gases
california
has
historically
been
allowed
to
have
stricter
emission
standards
due
to
the
state's
unique
geography
and
history
of
intense
air
pollution
highlighted
by
the
thick
smog
that
once
blanketed
southern
california
revoking
the
golden
state's
ability
to
set
its
own
standards
could
stymie
the
downward
trend
in
california's
air
pollution
california
gov
gavin
newsom
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
that
the
trump
administration
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
the
rest
of
the
world
on
cutting
emissions
and
fighting
global
warming
and
is
acting
on
a
political
vendetta
it's
a
move
that
could
have
devastating
consequences
for
our
kids
health
and
the
air
we
breathe
if
california
were
to
roll
over
newsom
said
but
we
will
not
we
will
fight
this
latest
attempt
and
defend
our
clean
car
standards
separately
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
trump
could
not
pull
the
waiver
while
the
white
house
clings
to
the
past
automakers
and
american
families
embrace
cleaner
cars
becerra
said
in
a
statement
it's
time
to
remove
your
blinders
president
trump
and
acknowledge
that
the
only
person
standing
in
the
way
of
progress
is
you
you
have
no
basis
and
no
authority
to
pull
this
waiver
we're
ready
to
fight
for
a
future
that
you
seem
unable
to
comprehend
we'll
see
you
in
court
if
you
stand
in
our
way
