private
tour
of
the

the
former
us
secretary
of

had
the
opportunity
to
confront
to
the
emails
that
were
sent
and
received
from
her
private
email
account
while
serving
the
government
between
and
and
the
same
ones
that
cost
her
the
presidential
election
the
curators
wrote
in
a
statement
clinton
proceeded
to
sit
down
at
an
exact
replica
of
the
oval
office's
resolute
desk
and
leaf
through
her
emails
for
nearly
an
hour

of
the

president
donald
trump
made
clinton's
use
of
private
email
servers
during
her
tenure
as
secretary
of
state
a
focal
point
of
his
presidential
campaign
rhetoric
the
fbi's
investigation
found
that
of
the
emails
clinton
provided
to
the
state
department
from
her
server
back
in
contained
classified
information
at
the
time
they
were
sent
or
received
the
agency
did
not
recommend
charges
against
clinton
though
then-fbi
director
james
comey
rebuked
her
and
her
aides
for
being
extremely
careless
during
an
interview
with
italian
news
outlet
tgr
veneto
outside
of
the
theater
clinton
slammed
the
controversy
surrounding
her
emails
as
unnecessary
it
was
and
is
still
one
of
the
strangest
most
absurd
events
in
american
political
history
she
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
clip
and
anyone
can
go
in
and
look
at
them
there's
nothing
there
it's
an
artistic
way
of
making
the
same
point
that
i
made
in
the
book
i
wrote
what
happened
clinton
continued
and
that
is
there
was
nothing
wrong
there
was
nothing
that
should
have
been
so
controversial
on
thursday
the
former
secretary
of
state
tweeted
a
photo
of
herself
sitting
behind
the
replica
of
the
resolute
desk
with
copies
of
the
emails
writing
found
my
emails
at
the
venice
biennale
someone
alert
the
house
gop
during
her
interview
on
tuesday
clinton
also
warned
european
countries
to
be
vigilant
of
russian
attacks
on
their
elections
similar
to
those
experienced
by
the
united
states
in
europeans
should
be
very
aware
of
the
russians
who
are
involved
in
and
trying
to
influence
elections
in
all
the
democracies
and
they
conducted
a
sweeping
and
systematic
attack
on
our
elections
she
said
so
that
was
a
big
factor
that
had
never
been
part
of
our
system
before
the
exhibit
opened
in
may
at
the
despar
teatro
italia
and
will
last
until
november
according
to
the
curators
goldsmith
who
was
in
new
york
during
clinton's
visit
said
that
the
visit
came
about
after
a
high
school
friend
of
clinton's
viewed
the
exhibit
clinton
also
commented
on
the
venue
that
hosted
the
exhibit
a
former
theater
that
has
been
converted
into
a
supermarket
during
the
interview
with
tgr
veneto
i
think
it's
the
most
amazing
supermarket
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
