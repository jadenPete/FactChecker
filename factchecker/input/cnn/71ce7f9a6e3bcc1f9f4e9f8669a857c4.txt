house
panel
approves
impeachment
inquiry
parameters
as
democrats
try
to
clarify
their
strategy
cnn
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
thursday
approved
a
resolution
defining
the
rules
of
the
panel's
impeachment
investigation
the
first
vote
the
committee
has
taken
related
to
the
potential
impeachment
of
president
donald
trump
the
party-line
vote
came
as
house
democrats
have
struggled
to
define
the
committee's
probe
with
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
saying
the
committee
is
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
while
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
other
democratic
leaders
are
refraining
from
calling
it
that
thursday's
vote
which
does
not
need
to
be
approved
by
the
full
house
gives
nadler
the
ability
to
deem
committee
hearings
as
impeachment
hearings
it
allows
staff
to
question
witnesses
at
those
hearings
for
an
hour
after
members
conclude
gives
the
president's
lawyers
the
ability
to
respond
in
writing
to
public
testimony
and
allows
the
committee
to
collect
information
in
a
closed
setting
but
the
dissonant
messages
over
the
probe
have
prompted
frustration
among
rank-and-file
members
particularly
those
in
competitive
races
wary
of
impeachment
and
it
even
led
to
the
house's
no
democrat
walking
back
his
statement
on
the
committee's
investigation
on
wednesday
at
her
weekly
news
conference
thursday
pelosi
once
again
declined
to
say
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
which
happened
minutes
after
the
committee
adopted
its
resolution
stating
that's
what
it
was
in
fact
doing
nadler
sought
to
clarify
the
committee's
intentions
in
his
opening
statement
at
thursday's
committee
meeting
acknowledging
there
was
confusion
but
arguing
that
the
language
used
to
describe
the
investigation
wasn't
the
important
point
why
pelosi
has
yet
to
embrace
impeachment
this
committee
is
engaged
in
an
investigation
that
will
allow
us
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
with
respect
to
president
trump
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
the
new
york
democrat
said
but
let
me
clear
up
any
remaining
doubt
the
conduct
under
investigation
poses
a
threat
to
our
democracy
we
have
an
obligation
to
respond
to
this
threat
and
we
are
doing
so
but
georgia
rep
doug
collins
the
top
republican
on
the
judiciary
committee
charged
that
the
committee
had
become
a
giant
instagram
filter
that
democrats
were
trying
to
dress
up
what
they
were
really
doing
to
make
it
look
better
he
argued
that
the
democratic
resolution
was
not
anything
special
because
it
grants
the
chairman
powers
that
he
already
has
access
to
the
difference
between
formal
impeachment
proceedings
and
what
we're
doing
today
is
a
world
apart
no
matter
what
the
chairman
just
said
collins
said
adding
later
the
chairman
can
do
this
at
any
time
because
he
wants
the
appearance
of
something
that
it's
not
you're
not
in
an
impeachment
inquiry
after
the
committee
vote
collins
accused
democrats
of
trying
to
cover
for
their
moderate
members
by
not
voting
in
the
full
house
to
formally
establish
an
impeachment
inquiry
nadler
vows
aggressive
series
of
hearings
the
committee's
new
procedures
for
its
hearings
could
be
on
display
as
soon
as
next
week
when
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
is
scheduled
to
appear
on
tuesday
the
committee
in
july
subpoenaed
lewandowski
and
former
white
house
aides
rick
dearborn
and
rob
porter
to
testify
on
tuesday
but
it's
not
clear
if
the
white
house
will
direct
dearborn
and
porter
not
to
appear
making
the
same
immunity
claims
it
has
with
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
and
others
nadler
vowed
an
aggressive
series
of
hearings
under
the
committee's
procedures
approved
on
thursday
the
investigation
will
go
well
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
mueller
report
and
we
will
be
starting
with
a
first
hearing
on
september
th
we
expect
among
others
we
expect
mr
lewandowski
to
testify
he
said
nadler
and
committee
members
say
that
adopting
the
resolution
will
make
their
investigation
more
effective
as
they
gather
information
through
subpoenas
hearings
and
the
courts
to
decide
whether
to
introduce
articles
of
impeachment
against
the
president
but
the
broader
question
is
the
committee
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
has
flustered
democrats
all
week
to
nadler
and
many
on
the
committee
the
committee
is
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
they
argue
that
the
debate
over
how
to
label
the
investigation
is
merely
semantics
they
have
stated
publicly
and
in
court
filings
that
their
investigation
is
part
of
an
active
effort
to
decide
whether
to
pursue
impeachment
house
leaders
different
approach
house
leadership
however
has
taken
a
different
tack
pelosi
and
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
have
declined
this
week
to
say
affirmatively
that
the
committee's
investigation
was
an
impeachment
investigation
or
an
impeachment
inquiry
as
nadler
has
described
it
i
stand
by
what
he
have
been
doing
all
along
i
support
what
is
happening
in
the
judiciary
committee
that
enables
them
to
do
their
process
of
interrogation
and
their
investigation
and
i
salute
them
for
that
work
pelosi
said
when
asked
if
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
list
the
house
democrats
calling
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
when
reporters
pressed
her
if
she
was
uncomfortable
with
the
term
impeachment
inquiry
which
was
embraced
by
many
democrats
pelosi
turned
to
the
senate
instead
why
don't
we
spend
some
time
going
over
to
see
mitch
mcconnell
and
asking
him
why
he
doesn't
want
to
save
lives
she
asked
reporters
referring
to
democratic
efforts
to
advance
house-passed
background
checks
legislation
in
the
senate
why
is
it
that
you're
hung
up
on
a
word
over
here
when
lives
are
at
stake
over
there
hoyer
responded
no
on
wednesday
when
asked
whether
the
house
was
in
an
impeachment
inquiry
but
later
that
day
he
issued
a
statement
clarifying
his
comments
why
some
democrats
are
holding
out
on
impeachment
i
thought
the
question
was
in
regards
to
whether
the
full
house
is
actively
considering
articles
of
impeachment
which
we
are
not
at
this
time
hoyer
said
i
strongly
support
chairman
nadler
and
the
judiciary
committee
democrats
as
they
proceed
with
their
investigation
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
to
the
full
house
as
the
resolution
states
it
is
critical
that
congress
have
access
to
all
of
the
relevant
facts
and
we
will
follow
those
facts
wherever
they
lead
including
impeachment
hoyer's
statement
however
refrained
from
referencing
an
impeachment
inquiry
or
investigation
asked
by
cnn
wednesday
evening
whether
he
believed
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
he
declined
to
say
you
saw
my
statement
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything
else
and
house
caucus
chairman
hakeem
jeffries
who
is
a
judiciary
committee
member
said
wednesday
he
didn't
want
to
get
caught
in
semantics
when
asked
if
the
committee's
probe
was
an
impeachment
inquiry
following
thursday's
vote
on
the
committee
resolution
jeffries
told
cnn
that
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
into
the
culture
of
corruption
abuse
of
power
and
obstruction
of
justice
semantic
battle
symbolizes
broader
divide
rep
jamie
raskin
a
maryland
democrat
on
the
judiciary
committee
who
has
called
the
probe
an
impeachment
inquiry
said
the
dispute
is
emblematic
of
broader
divisions
about
what
to
do
about
impeachment
is
it
wise
to
pursue
he
said
some
have
suggested
when
the
house
knows
the
senate
won't
act
there
are
views
out
there
about
the
right
way
of
dealing
with
the
president
even
among
people
who
agree
he's
committed
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
raskin
said
if
you
believe
that
we
are
not
of
one
mind
about
how
to
proceed
you're
absolutely
right
nobody
knows
exactly
ultimately
about
how
to
proceed
but
everybody
believes
we
cannot
let
the
president
get
away
with
corruption
and
malpractice
in
office
while
democrats
have
suggested
the
dispute
over
labeling
the
panel's
investigation
isn't
important
as
the
work
itself
the
question
of
whether
the
committee
is
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
could
have
implications
when
the
judiciary
committee's
lawsuits
go
before
a
judge
in
the
coming
weeks
the
committee
is
suing
to
obtain
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
grand
jury
material
and
to
force
mcgahn
to
testify
and
it
has
argued
in
court
filings
its
investigation
is
part
of
an
active
consideration
of
whether
to
impeach
the
president
it's
the
facts
that
we
need
to
see
said
rep
steve
cohen
a
tennessee
democrat
who
has
pushed
for
trump's
impeachment
proof
needs
to
come
out
and
what
they
call
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
and
i
don't
know
what
it's
called
but
this
will
be
an
investigation
for
impeachment
there
is
no
question
about
it
people
are
stumbling
over
it
because
of
politics
so
be
it
it's
the
facts
that
need
to
be
introduced
to
the
american
people
to
hear
for
the
most
impeachable
president
in
the
history
of
this
country
this
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
developments
thursday
