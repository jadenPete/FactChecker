of
conservative
policy
newsom

to
reagan's
efforts
as
the
state's
governor
in

on
a
fundraising
trip
announced
on
wednesday
that
he
was
revoking
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
vehicle
emission
standards
california's
waiver
under
the
clean
air
act
allowed
it
to
set
standards
tighter
than
the
federal
government's
which
have
been
adopted
by
more
than
a
dozen
states
and
became
the
de-facto
nationwide
standard
because
automakers
do
not
design
different
sets
of
vehicles
to
meet
standards
in
different
states

regulations
and
his
administration's
deportation
policies
and
vilification
of
undocumented
immigrants
among
other
policy
disagreements
has
led
the
state
to
file
lawsuits
against
the
federal
government
since
trump
took
office
the
trump
administration
has
long
been
at
odds
with
california
a
state
that
prides
itself
as
the
center
of
the
resistance
to
his
agenda
especially
on
environmental
issues
trump
has
pledged
to
withdraw
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
a
global
deal
to
curb
emissions
and
has
sought
to
increase
fossil
fuel
output
by
fracking
on
public
lands
and
drilling
offshore
he's
greenlit
new
pipelines
and
now
he's
rolling
back
regulations
meant
to
make
cars
and
trucks
more
fuel
efficient
