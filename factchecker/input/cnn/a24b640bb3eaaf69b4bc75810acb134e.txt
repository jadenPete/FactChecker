vice

mike
pence
once
argued
that
homosexuality
was
a
choice
during
his
fight
in
the
early
s
against
local
efforts
in
indiana
to
ban
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
pence's
opposition
to
lgbt
equality
has
long
drawn
the
scorn
of
gay
rights
activists
and
made
him
a
champion
of
the
religious
right
but
scrutiny
of
pence's
record
on
lgbt
issues
intensified
recently
when
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
judd
deere
suggested
last
week
in
a
tweet
that
the
vice
president
wasn't
anti-gay
because
he
was
having
lunch
with
the
irish
prime
minister
who
is
gay
and
his
partner
during
a
state
visit
the
little-explored
episode
in
the
s
unearthed
in
local
newspaper
clippings
during
a
deeper
kfile
review
of
pence's
record
on
lgbt
issues
highlights
an
early
window
into
the
now-vice
president's
public
activism
and
views
in
opposition
of
gay
rights
darin
miller
a
spokesman
for
pence
told
cnn
in
a
statement
that
the
vice
president
has
always
opposed
discrimination
in
any
form
and
defends
the
constitution's
protection
of
the
rights
of
all
americans
regardless
of
race
sex
or
religion
pence
argued
in
the
s
that
unlike
protections
for
african
americans
homosexuals
choose
or
learn
to
be
gay
and
was
part
of
a
grassroots-generated
movement
for
recognition
of
homosexual
rights
nationwide
once
you
identify
homosexuals
as
a
minority
then
by
definition
they
would
need
to
be
afforded
constitutional
protection
pence
added
up
to
this
point
our
legal
tradition
in
america
has
drawn
a
line
over
those
things
i
do
not
choose
whether
i
am
a
black
american
the
great
vast
majority
of
the
psychological
community
says
homosexuality
at
a
very
minimum
is
a
choice
by
the
individual
and
at
the
maximum
is
a
learned
behavior
the
american
psychological
association
said
in
that
data
did
not
support
the
view
that
homosexuality
was
a
choice
and
studies
at
the
time
in
the
s
suggested
homosexuality
was
biological
and
genetic
the
arguments
made
in
the
s
by
pence
would
echo
those
he
later
emphasized
when
he
ran
for
congress
in
when
his
platform
protested
extending
civil
rights
protections
to
gay
americans
but
the
s
comments
show
for
the
first
time
pence
calling
homosexuality
a
choice
and
offer
a
clearer
view
into
pence's
view
on
gay
americans
at
the
time
as
president
of
the
conservative
think
tank
indiana
policy
review
foundation
pence
opposed
a
vote
by
the
city
council
of
lafayette
indiana
to
make
itself
the
first
city
in
the
state
to
add
sexual
orientation
to
its
anti-discrimination
law
designating
gay
americans
worthy
of
such
protections
under
the
law
pence
said
would
open
a
pandora's
box
of
legal
rights
and
legal
difficulties
and
was
part
of
grassroots
movements
by
gay
activists
for
increasing
their
rights
pence
became
president
of
the
indiana
policy
review
in
his
tenure
there
along
with
his
years
following
as
a
statewide
radio
and
tv
host
helped
transform
pence's
reputation
from
that
of
a
twice-failed
congressional
candidate
into
an
influential
conservative
voice
in
the
state
in
september
lafayette
indiana
first
proposed
adding
homosexuality
to
its
non-discrimination
ordinance
the
ordinance
which
featured
exemptions
for
churches
and
church-affiliated
groups
would
give
a
group
of
nine
people
appointed
by
the
mayor
the
ability
to
investigate
and
mediate
discrimination
complaints
against
homosexual
or
bi-sexual
residents
in
housing
public
accommodations
and
employment
public
opinion
polls
in
the
us
at
the
time
were
equally
divided
over
whether
homosexuality
should
be
accepted
by
society
and
many
of
the
ballot
initiatives
in
aimed
at
denouncing
homosexuality
or
repealing
measures
that
protected
homosexuals
from
discrimination
had
mixed
results
bill
clinton
would
be
elected
that
year
campaigning
on
ending
the
ban
on
homosexuals
serving
in
the
military
pence
argued
the
issue
of
gay
rights
would
become
one
of
the
most
important
issues
of
the
s
they're
discussing
in
lafayette
what
i
suspect
will
be
one
of
the
biggest
issues
of
the
s
pence
said
you've
got
a
tiger
by
the
tail
a
vote
on
the
ordinance
originally
failed
narrowly
with
some
members
voting
against
it
to
wait
for
a
city
council
member
to
return
from
vacation
to
vote
with
issue
momentarily
tabled
an
eight
months-long
debate
began
with
panels
and
news
forums
across
the
state
covering
the
issue
though
some
residents
and
religious
ministers
argued
against
the
measure
because
they
said
homosexuality
was
a
sin
and
they
did
not
want
to
hire
or
rent
to
homosexuals
pence
and
the
indiana
policy
review
opposed
the
measure
on
public
policy
grounds
it
represents
a
very
bad
move
in
public
policy
pence
said
in
january
it
opens
up
from
a
legal
standpoint
a
pandora's
box
of
legal
rights
and
legal
difficulties
once
you
identify
homosexuals
as
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
the
ordinance
passed
in
may
by
a
vote
with
pence
saying
it
was
an
attempt
to
reform
the
civil
rights
act
no
federal
agency
or
state
agency
has
ever
spoken
to
the
question
of
sexual
preference
as
a
source
of
civil
rights
