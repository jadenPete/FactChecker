trump's
complex
relationship
with
guns
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
cast
doubt
monday
he
could
come
to
an
agreement
with
democrats
on
gun
control
as
lawmakers
await
his
proposals
to
combat
deadly
shootings
it
was
a
downbeat
signal
from
trump
on
finding
common
ground
with
political
rivals
on
the
issue
which
gained
momentum
after
an
august
book-ended
by
gruesome
shooting
sprees
trump
discussed
gun
control
for
minutes
by
phone
sunday
with
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
the
democrats
promised
they
would
join
him
for
an
historic
rose
garden
signing
ceremony
if
he
gets
behind
a
house-passed
bill
expanding
background
checks
to
nearly
all
gun
sales
but
the
white
house
has
already
threatened
to
veto
that
bill
and
trump
himself
on
monday
signaled
he
has
doubts
about
democrats
stated
motives
the
big
questions
are
the
president
tweeted
will
they
move
the
goalposts
and
is
this
just
a
ploy
to
take
your
guns
away
i
hope
not
on
both
counts
but
i'll
be
able
to
figure
it
out
trump
wrote
after
more
than
a
month
of
discussions
between
white
house
and
congressional
officials
on
guns
there
remains
little
clarity
on
where
trump
stands
on
expanding
background
checks
even
in
private
trump
has
not
revealed
a
final
position
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
discussions
that
has
led
to
doubts
the
president
will
ultimately
put
his
support
behind
background
checks
legislation
including
a
bipartisan
measure
from
sens
joe
manchin
d-west
virginia
and
pat
toomey
r-pennsylvania
which
is
more
limited
in
scope
than
the
house
bill
that
passed
in
february

after
former
congressman's
ar-
comment
after
a
pair
of
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
at
the
beginning
of
august
trump
voiced
support
for
expanding
background
checks
he
was
urged
on
in
part
by
daughter
and
senior
adviser
ivanka
trump
along
with
some
republican
senators
such
as
toomey
who
support
such
a
move
but
others
in
his
inner
circle
cautioned
the
move
might
be
politically
unpopular
among
his
supporters
the
debate
over
gun
control
has
galvanized
democrats
who
cite
polls
showing
the
vast
majority
of
the
country
is
with
them
in
supporting
expanding
background
checks
at
a
debate
last
week
among
democratic
primary
contenders
former
texas
rep
beto

vowed
to
enact

he
said
a
comment
republicans
seized
upon
afterward
in
his
tweet
on
monday
trump
appeared
to
echo
his
fellow
republicans
criticism
by
asking
if
democrats
were
working
to
take
away
guns
on
friday
high-level
calls
took
place
between
the
justice
department
and
capitol
hill
about
background
checks
an
official
familiar
with
the
conversations
said
with
attorney
general
bill
barr
who
has
also
nudged
trump
to
support
universal
background
checks
sending
a
signal
that
talks
had
ground
to
a
halt
and
prospects
for
presidential
support
for
a
background
checks
bill
seemed
to
be
dimming
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
said
he
won't
move
on
any
gun
measures
until
trump
spells
out
his
position
after
conversations
with
trump
last
week
some
lawmakers
suggested
his
proposals
would
be
coming
imminently
but
nothing
has
yet
materialized
though
officials
said
a
plan
would
likely
come
this
week
call
with
democrats
white
house
considering
phone
app
for
background
checks
in
the
sunday
phone
call
which
came
at
pelosi
and
schumer's
request
the
democrats
told
him
that
anything
short
of
the
house-passed
measure
would
be
insufficient
the
white
house
said
the
call
was
cordial
but
said
trump
offered
no
commitments
on
the
house
background
checks
bill
trump
instead
indicated
his
interest
in
working
to
find
a
bipartisan
legislative
solution
on
appropriate
responses
to
the
issue
of
mass
gun
violence
a
white
house
spokesman
judd
deere
said
the
call
came
after
trump
was
briefed
by
advisers
last
thursday
about
his
options
on
gun
control
officials
did
not
delve
into
specific
legislative
details
and
trump
did
not
appear
interested
in
some
of
the
nitty-gritty
of
how
each
proposal
would
work
a
person
familiar
with
the
briefing
said
said
options
the
white
house
is
considering
include
a
phone
application
connected
to
the
national
instant
criminal
background
checks
nics
the
app
would
be
used
for
background
checks
during
private
sales
and
not
ones
involving
commercial
dealers
two
sources
familiar
with
the
plans
said
the
proposal
wasn't
finalized
and
is
still
awaiting
sign-off
from
the
president
the
sources
said
currently
there
are
no
federally
mandated
background
checks
for
private
sales
gun
rights
and
privacy
advocates
have
already
voiced
concerns
about
such
an
app
because
they
say
it
could
become
a
de
facto
registry
and
there
are
concerns
over
how
secure
the
information
would
be
the
app
idea
is
one
in
a
roster
of
ideas
being
mulled
by
trump
as
he
comes
under
pressure
to
act
on
guns
other
proposals
include
allowing
minors
records
to
be
included
in
background
check
databases
alerting
local
authorities
when
someone
fails
a
background
check
and
applying
bigger
penalties
for
straw
purchases
when
someone
buys
a
gun
for
someone
else
the
administration
is
also
looking
at
measures
that
would
help
states
implement
so-called
red
flag
laws
which
would
remove
weapons
from
people
deemed
at
risk
and
expediting
the
death
penalty
for
convicted
mass
shooters
