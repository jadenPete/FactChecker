nadler
personally
i
think
the
president
ought
to
be
impeached
but
public
has
to
be
on
board
why
dems
are
losing
the
messaging
war
on
impeachment
cnn
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
said
monday
he
believes
the
house
should
impeach
president
donald
trump
and
now
it's
his
committee's
job
to
convince
the
public
that
it's
the
correct
course
of
action
before
the
house
moves
forward
personally
i
think
the
president
ought
to
be
impeached
nadler
told
wnyc's
brian
lehrer
nadler's
comments
were
some
of
the
most
detailed
he
has
offered
thus
far
about
his
rationale
for
the
house
to
pursue
impeachment
he
said
that
he
believes
the
house
should
act
on
impeachment
even
if
the
senate
will
not
remove
the
president
because
congress
has
to
vindicate
the
constitution
we
have
to
show
that
this
kind
of
behavior
trashing
the
constitution
trashing
all
the
norms
which
guarantee
democratic
government
aggrandizing
power
to
the
presidency
and
destroying
the
separation
of
powers
and
thereby
leading
the
president
to
become
more
and
more
of
a
tyrant
cannot
be
tolerated
and
it
cannot
be
normalized
nadler
said
we
have
to
make
sure
the
next
president
or
the
one
after
him
or
her
knows
there's
a
real
penalty
to
be
paid
that's
why
the
impeachment
is
necessary
even
if
we
cannot
get
a
vote
in
the
senate
the
new
york
democrat
cited
multiple
allegations
his
committee
is
investigating
including
trump's
alleged
violations
of
the
emoluments
clause
of
the
constitution
public
corruption
obstruction
of
justice
and
abuse
of
power
as
well
as
defying
congressional
subpoenas
but
nadler
acknowledged
that
the
house
should
not
go
forward
with
impeachment
unless
it
has
the
public's
support
not
just
because
the
public
would
view
it
as
undemocratic
and
it
would
tear
the
country
apart
but
also
because
the
votes
won't
be
there
without
public
support
we
cannot
impeach
the
president
against
the
will
of
the
american
people
he
said
he
argued
that
the
public
has
not
heard
most
of
the
evidence
against
the
president
which
is
why
the
committee
has
to
hold
impeachment
hearings
beginning
with
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
who
is
expected
to
appear
tuesday
under
subpoena
for
a
public
hearing
nadler
said
he
has
designated
the
hearing
as
an
impeachment
hearing
but
expressed
skepticism
lewandowski
would
say
much
about
the
episodes
where
he's
cited
in
the
mueller
report
as
the
white
house
has
previously
directed
other
witnesses
not
to
talk
about
anything
that
occurred
during
the
trump
administration
we
have
to
show
that
there
are
adequate
grounds
for
impeachment
that
there
are
imperative
grounds
for
impeachment
and
convince
people
he
said
if
that
happens
if
people
are
convinced
after
the
hearings
that
the
president
should
be
impeached
then
we'll
be
able
to
get
the
votes
nadler
said
it
should
be
clear
that
his
committee
is
conducting
an
impeachment
investigation
though
it's
something
that
flustered
house
democrats
last
week
as
the
judiciary
committee
voted
to
formalize
the
rules
of
its
investigation
in
the
interview
monday
nadler
blamed
the
press
for
the
confusion
but
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
refused
to
call
the
committee's
probe
an
impeachment
investigation
which
the
justice
department
cited
in
its
court
filings
late
last
week
to
deny
the
committee
access
to
robert
mueller's
grand
jury
materials
the
judiciary
committee
chairman
was
also
asked
about
new
allegations
against
justice
brett
kavanaugh
from
the
new
york
times
this
weekend
nadler
said
he's
got
questions
for
fbi
director
chris
wray
about
the
fbi's
handling
of
the
kavanaugh
investigation
during
his
confirmation
but
also
said
the
committee
is
concentrated
on
its
impeachment
investigation
cnn
is
not
reporting
any
details
of
the
accusation
and
has
not
independently
corroborated
the
account
the
times
on
sunday
evening
published
an
editor's
note
to
its
original
story
saying
the
female
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
her
friends
told
the
authors
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
nadler
who
reiterated
his
belief
that
the
fbi
investigation
into
kavanaugh's
past
was
a
sham
said
he
would
address
the
issue
with
wray
when
he
testifies
before
the
committee
and
then
decide
if
the
committee
would
take
further
action
nadler
has
previously
asked
the
national
archives
to
produce
documents
related
to
kavanaugh's
time
in
the
george
w.
bush
white
house
