faces
deadline
to
turn
over
whistleblower
complaint
schiff
i
asked
dni
if
whistleblower
was
related
to
investigations
cnn
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
faces
a
deadline
tuesday
to
turn
over
a
whistleblower
complaint
that
was
never
alerted
to
the
house
intelligence
committee
whose
chairman
says
he
confronted
the
dni
over
the
matter
maguire's
office
says
they
are
reviewing
the
request
but
house
intelligence
chairman
adam
schiff
has
said
if
the
complaint
is
not
turned
over
he'll
force
the
national
intelligence
chief
to
appear
publicly
before
congress
later
this
week
schiff
said
on
anderson
cooper
monday
night
that
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general's
found
the
complaint
to
be
credible
and
of
urgent
concern
conditions
that
schiff
says
require
congressional
notification
the
california
democrat
told
cnn's
anderson
cooper
that
he
had
found
maguire's
answers
on
the
matter
to
be
not
very
encouraging
noting
that
the
newly
installed
acting
dni
had
initially
answered
no
when
asked
if
the
complaint
involved
something
the
committee
was
investigating
but
was
immediately
corrected
by
his
legal
counsel
who
said
they
could
not
say
that
schiff
then
issued
a
subpoena
to
maguire
on
friday
demanding
he
produce
all
relevant
details
related
to
the
complaint
an
announcement
that
has
sparked
questions
as
to
whether
the
administration
may
have
violated
whistleblower
protections
and
whether
the
president
or
top
white
house
officials
were
involved
in
the
case
the
dni
acknowledged
that
this
involves
someone
apparently
outside
of
the
authority
of
the
dni
someone
above
the
dni
there
aren't
that
many
in
that
category
and
they
also
suggested
that
there
may
be
privilege
issues
here
which
means
that
it
would
have
to
involve
communications
of
the
president
or
people
around
him
schiff
said
monday
night
schiff
said
he
does
not
know
the
exact
nature
of
the
complaint
as
he
has
not
yet
received
the
details
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
nor
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
he
declined
to
say
whether
he
has
been
contacted
by
the
whistleblower
or
their
legal
representation
saying
he
wouldn't
want
to
jeopardize
them
a
spokesperson
for
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
told
cnn
earlier
monday
that
they
have
received
the
subpoena
but
have
not
yet
responded
the
deadline
for
the
subpoena
is
tomorrow
tuesday
september
we
are
currently
reviewing
the
request
and
will
respond
appropriately
the
odni
and
acting
dni
maguire
are
committed
to
fully
complying
with
the
law
and
upholding
whistleblower
protections
and
have
done
so
here
the
spokesperson
added
schiff
is
demanding
that
maguire
turn
over
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general's
determination
and
all
records
pertaining
to
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
odni
involvement
in
this
matter
including
any
and
all
correspondence
with
other
executive
branch
actors
such
as
the
white
house
according
to
last
week's
news
release
from
the
congressman's
office
a
director
of
national
intelligence
has
never
prevented
a
properly
submitted
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
ic
ig
determined
to
be
credible
and
urgent
from
being
provided
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
never
this
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct
schiff
said
last
week
in
a
statement
schiff
added
absent
compliance
with
the
subpoena
the
committee
plans
to
require
acting
director
maguire
to
appear
before
the
committee
in
an
open
hearing
on
thursday
september
schiff's
statement
said
the
intelligence
community's
inspector
general
sent
a
letter
to
the
house
intelligence
committee
on
september
notifying
it
of
the
complaint
the
next
day
schiff
said
he
requested
the
full
and
unredacted
complaint
only
to
receive
a
response
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
three
days
later
declining
that
request
