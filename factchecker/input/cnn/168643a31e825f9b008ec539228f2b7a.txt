trump's
california
trip
marked
by
pair
of
clashes
los
angeles
cnn
even
before
president
donald
trump
arrived
in
california
on
tuesday
his
administration
issued
yet
another
pre-emptive
strike
at
the
state
that
likes
to
pride
itself
as
the
center
of
the
resistance
to
his
agenda
following
vague
threats
that
his
administration
might
seek
to
commandeer
what
trump
views
as
the
state's
feckless
response
to
its
homeless
crisis
white
house
officials
also
signaled
a
second
battle
on
the
environmental
front
doing
away
with
the
state's
right
to
put
in
place
more
stringent
vehicle
emissions
standards
than
the
federal
government
even
with
that
threat
looming
california's
leaders
have
taken
a
softer
approach
on
the
homeless
crisis
gripping
the
golden
state
still
leaders
here
are
concerned
that
a
heavy-handed
intervention
from
the
trump
administration
could
upend
carefully
calibrated
plans
for
building
thousands
of
new
units
of
affordable
housing
and
wrap-around-services
for
those
living
on
the
streets
trump
made
his
way
to
the
bay
area
for
a
west
coast
swing
that
is
expected
to
net
as
much
as
million
in
campaign
fundraising
he
took
the
opportunity
to
weigh
in
the
state's
homeless
crisis
namely
the
nuisance
that
businesses
and
high-dollar
tenants
must
deal
with
as
homeless
californians
erect
tents
on
sidewalks
and
in
the
doorways
of
corporations
and
businesses
they
can't
believe
what's
happening
ben
carson
to
visit
california
next
week
to
address
homelessness
we
can't
let
los
angeles
san
francisco
and
numerous
other
cities
destroy
themselves
by
allowing
what's
happening
and
i'm
speaking
to
tenants
in
some
cases
foreign
people
where
they're
tenants
in
buildings
throughout
various
cities
in
california
and
other
places
where
they
want
to
leave
the
country
they
can't
believe
what's
happening
trump
told
reporters
on
air
force
one
we
have
people
living
in
our
best
highways
our
best
streets
our
best
entrances
to
buildings
and
pay
tremendous
taxes
trump
added
noting
they
are
places
where
people
in
those
buildings
pay
tremendous
taxes
where
they
went
to
those
locations
because
of
the
prestige
the
president
said
that
he
would
work
with
housing
secretary
ben
carson
to
confront
the
issue
the
people
of
san
francisco
are
fed
up
and
the
people
of
los
angeles
are
fed
up
and
we're
looking
at
it
and
we'll
be
doing
something
about
it
trump
said
as
he
was
flying
to
the
bay
area
for
a
fundraiser
at
a
separate
event
carson
was
vague
when
asked
whether
the
administration's
plans
would
use
police
to
get
homeless
people
off
the
street
and
into
federal
facilities
the
policy
includes
being
logical
and
looking
at
things
that
work
and
are
effective
and
looking
at
best
practices
wherever
they
exist
around
the
world
and
trying
to
be
fair
to
all
the
people
that's
what
the
policy
entails
he
said
on
tuesday
before
trump
arrived
several
top
california
leaders
extended
an
olive
branch
hoping
to
persuade
him
to
join
with
them
in
building
out
an
effective
strategy
for
getting
the
homeless
housed
across
the
golden
state
it
is
still
unclear
what
the
administration
plans
to
do
about
the
half-million
americans
who
are
living
on
the
street
on
any
given
night
but
on
monday
the
acting
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
advisers
tomas
philipson
highlighted
the
trump
administration's
efforts
to
remove
government
barriers
in
the
housing
market
that
he
said
limit
supply
and
thereby
raises
prices
for
housing
that
lead
to
americans
ending
up
on
the
streets
philipson
noted
that
of
the
nation's
homeless
population
lives
in
california
though
the
state
accounts
for
of
the
nation's
population
one-fifth
of
the
entire
homeless
population
is
living
in
los
angeles
county
harmful
local
government
policies
in
select
cities
along
with
ineffective
federal
government
policies
of
prior
administrations
have
exaggerated
the
homelessness
problem
philipson
said
the
trump
administration
is
working
to
reverse
the
failed
policies
of
the
past
and
instead
implement
policies
that
address
the
underlying
causes
of
homelessness
a
plea
newsom

is
promoting

to
more

of
temporary

that
the

directly
commending
him
for
his
interest
in
addressing
la's
homeless
crisis
i
wanted
to
talk
to
the
president
today
because
he
has
shown
an
interest
in
the
issue
of
homelessness
garcetti
said
in
a
plea
for
more
federal
resources
as
he
filmed
the
interior
of
the
new
shelter
which
has
individual
pods
that
have
beds
cabinets
and
even
cages
for
la's
homeless
to
house
their
pets
it's
no
secret
that
i've
disagreed
with
you
on
almost
everything
mr
president
but
if
you
are
in
your
heart
willing
to
save
lives
alongside
us
we
know
what
works
here
garcetti
said
it
is
time
for
us
to
pause
politics
and
not
to
demonize
americans
who
are
on
the
street
garcetti
added
that
the
rate
of
homelessness
in
washington
dc
in
the
backyard
of
the
white
house
is
even
higher
than
here
in
la
the

the
second

garcetti
sent
trump
a
letter
thanking
him
for
a
visit
that
trump
administration
staff
made
to
learn
about
the
efforts
that
are
underway
in
los
angeles
to
provide
temporary
and
permanent
housing
to
those
living
on
the
city's
streets
he
noted
that

who
frequently
spars
with
the

sent
him
a
letter
outlining
potential
white
house
steps
that
his
administration
believes
would
do
the
most
to
ameliorate
the
problem
in
the
golden
state
newsom
asked
trump
to
provide
more
vouchers
through
federal
programs
that
provide
rental
subsidies
for
extremely
low-income
americans
while
increasing
the
value
of
those
vouchers
to
meet
the
high
cost
of
rent
particularly
in
california
the
california
governor
also
asked
the
trump
administration
to
work
with
his
administration
on
a
program
to
incentivize
landlords
to
work
with
voucher
holders
to
find
stable

the

so
many
who
suffer
on
our

these
federal
programs
have
a
track
record
of
success
when
implemented
properly
and
we
urge

consider
this
request
