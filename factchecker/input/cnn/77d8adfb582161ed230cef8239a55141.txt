kamala
harris
plans
to
get
personal
as
she
looks
for
a
debate
breakthrough
harris
on
trump
lead
or
get
out
of
the
way
cnn
with
her
poll
numbers
hitting
a
stubborn
plateau
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
may
become
a
key
moment
for
sen
kamala
harris
to
recapture
the
momentum
her
candidacy
has
lost
in
recent
weeks
multiple
sources
inside
and
outside
the
campaign
said
this
is
a
crucial
month
for
her
in
fundraising
and
debates
one
harris
adviser
said
the
campaign
can't
survive
on
glimpses
and
glimmers
if
she
doesn't
do
well
it's
harder
to
reverse
the
shift
the
source
added
harris
team
hopes
to
surface
a
different
side
of
the
california
senator
and
former
prosecutor
one
that
emphasizes
aspects
of
her
personality
that
are
more
often
seen
in
unscripted
moments
on
the
campaign
trail
than
in
harris
biggest
televised
moments
on
the
national
stage
according
to
multiple
campaign
aides
the
objective
defend
harris
record
while
also
appearing
presidential
by
staying
above
the
fray
and
avoiding
messy
fights
on
the
stage
aides
want
harris
to
continue
opening
up
about
her
personal
experiences
channeling
interactions
with
voters
where
her
aides
believe
she
has
most
shined
on
the
campaign
trail
and
countering
a
perception
that
she
is
overly
rehearsed
and
planned
harris
toughness
and
ability
to
prosecute
a
case
against
a
second
term
for
president
donald
trump
has
been
the
centerpiece
of
her
appeal
to
voters
whether
it
is
harris
questioning
of
trump
administration
officials
or
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
during
congressional
testimony
the
campaign
has
been
eager
to
embrace
harris
persona
as
a
candidate
who
is
tough
enough
for
a
general
election
fight
against
trump
but
at
thursday's
primary
debate
her
campaign
hopes
she
will
lean
into
an
earlier
theme
in
her
campaign
being
a
joyful
warrior
according
to
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
strategy
her
entire
tagline
as
being
a
joyful
warrior
is
something
that
people
respond
to
really
well
on
the
campaign
trail
and
that's
something
they
want
people
to
see
on
the
debate
as
well
that
aide
said
for
harris
the
terrain
of
the
primary
race
has
suddenly
threatened
to
morph
into
quicksand
her
poll
numbers
have
stagnated
in
the
mid-single
digits
after
her
spike
following
the
june
debate
when
cnn
released
an
august
poll
that
showed
harris
had
fallen
back
down
to
nationally
a
harris
campaign
adviser
described
it
as
the
lowest
point
of
the
campaign
thus
far
i
think
sometimes
she
feels
like
she's
putting
a
guard
up
like
it's
more
of
a
show
you
know
what
i
mean
yamaisi
errasti
a
year
old
university
of
south
carolina
graduate
student
who
is
still
an
undecided
voter
told
cnn
it's
just
trying
to
pursue
or
portray
a
certain
image
of
herself
as
opposed
to
her
authentic
self
ian
sams
harris's
national
press
secretary
said
the
senator's
focus
in
this
debate
will
be
on
pitching
herself
as
a
unifying
candidate
kamala
will
take
on
donald
trump
directly
and
will
focus
on
bringing
the
country
together
by
defeating
him
and
unifying
americans
around
solutions
to
our
common
challenges
sams
said
she'll
make
the
connection
between
his
hatred
and
division
and
our
inability
to
get
things
done
for
the
country

her
campaign
is
also
seeking
to
confront
a
challenge
that
harris
uniquely
faces
as
a
black
woman
running
for
president
rounding
out
her
image
as
both
competent
and
presidential
while
also
revealing
more
of
her
personal
side
it's
a
black
woman
running
for
president
of
the
united
states
said
bakari
sellers
a
harris
surrogate
and
cnn
political
commentator
and
i
think
the
bar
is
going
to
be
higher
and
she
has
to
be
able
to
reach
that
and
i'm
sure
she
will
so
i
think
a
lot
of
it
is
just
navigating
that
he
added
still
some
harris
aides
downplayed
the
significance
of
this
debate
for
her
arguing
that
voters
are
just
beginning
to
pay
attention
to
the
race
and
there
is
still
time
for
harris
to
capture
their
attention
we're
now
in
the
part
of
the
race
where
voters
start
kicking
the
tires
one
campaign
senior
official
said
we're
now
getting
into
the
meat
of
the
campaign
past
performances
june's
debate
provided
harris
the
high
point
of
her
campaign
harris
took
joe
biden
to
task
for
his
remarks
about
two
segregationist
senators
in
which
he
cited
them
as
examples
of
colleagues
he
could
work
with
during
an
era
where
at
least
there
was
some
civility
in
the
senate
harris
called
the
words
hurtful
then
recalled
how
as
a
child
she
was
bused
to
school
in
a
local
effort
to
desegregate
districts
that
little
girl
was
me
she
told
biden
the
attack
proved
effective
in
getting
the
attention
of
some
democratic
voters
but
campaign
aides
advisers
and
donors
say
that
the
aftermath
has
been
complex
she
experienced
a
bump
in
both
polls
and
fundraising
afterward
but
one
harris
fundraiser
complained
that
the
attack
backfired
because
it
now
looks
more
like
a
premeditated
ambush
with
the
campaign
even
printing
t-shirts
with
harris
line
that
little
girl
was
me
the
t-shirt
and
preparation
felt
staged
and
prosecutorial
more
like
a
courtroom
act
the
fundraiser
said
the
days
following
harris
performance
were
inconsistent
she
struggled
to
clearly
explain
whether
she
would
support
federally
mandated
busing
in
current
times
when
pressed
by
reporters
prompting
a
heated
back
and
forth
between
biden
harris
and
their
surrogates
over
whether
harris
and
biden
actually
agree
on
the
very
issue
she
used
to
attack
the
former
vice
president
aides
described
harris's
second
debate
performance
in
july
as
a
wash
it
was
neither
disastrous
for
her
candidacy
nor
was
it
particularly
helpful
cnn
poll
biden
leads
as
warren
and
sanders
battle
for
second
on
eve
of
debate
but
the
most
damaging
moment
came
when
rep
tulsi
gabbard
levied
an
attack
that
many
of
harris
allies
described
as
predictable
on
harris
prosecutor
record
gabbard
attacked
harris
record
as
california
attorney
general
in
a
string
of
accusations
some
of
which
were
later
deemed
by
fact
checkers
to
be
false
and
misleading
even
though
the
campaign
saw
the
gabbard
attack
coming
harris
failed
to
effectively
halt
or
avert
it
aides
acknowledged
that
harris
was
not
prepared
and
didn't
effectively
shut
down
the
attacks
on
the
stage
in
rolling
out
her
criminal
justice
plan
this
week
the
campaign
wants
the
senator
to
be
able
to
defend
her
record
and
refocus
the
criticism
harris
faced
on
her
plan
to
reform
the
system
harris
has
also
faced
more
questions
about
the
very
critiques
levied
at
her
by
gabbard
and
criminal
justice
reform
activists
especially
in
the
area
of
legalizing
marijuana
and
the
disproportionate
rate
of
people
of
color
who
are
convicted
emotionally
it's
hurtful
she
told
the
new
york
times
about
the
criticism
coming
from
young
black
activists
taken
together
the
two
moments
harris's
moment
with
biden
and
the
exchange
with
gabbard
portrayed
harris
as
eager
to
go
on
the
attack
on
other
candidates
records
but
unable
to
defend
her
own
this
time
however
there
will
be
less
of
a
focus
of
pitting
harris
against
any
of
the
other
candidates
on
the
stage
and
far
more
focus
on
painting
a
clearer
picture
for
voters
of
who
she
is
i
would
want
to
see
more
about
her
personality
said
ivon
garcia
of
rockville
maryland
told
cnn
i
personally
don't
know
much
about
harris
right
now
aides
are
watching
for
other
dynamics
on
the
stage
as
well
they're
zeroing
in
on
how
biden
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
interact
and
if
warren
becomes
a
bigger
target
from
the
field
given
her
rise
in
the
polls
harris
insiders
say
warren
is
increasingly
viewed
as
the
candidate
who
poses
the
biggest
concern
to
harris
because
her
support
has
continued
to
grow
at
a
gradual
but
constant
rate
that
suggests
warren's
support
is
far
less
likely
to
collapse
a
harris
campaign
adviser
said
