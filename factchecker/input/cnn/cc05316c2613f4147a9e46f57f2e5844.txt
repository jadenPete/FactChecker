response
is
the
democratic
party
in
a
nutshell
they
are
more
offended
by
truthful
words
than
the
acts
of
their
political
ideology
that
has
killed
millions
of
innocent
victims
i
don't
care
about

action
committee
described
the
ad
as
a
select
tv
buy
in
major
media
markets
an
abc
spokeswoman
said
the
ad
did
not
run
on
the
national
telecast
of
the
debate
meaning
it
was
purchased
through
local
stations
in
markets
like
washington
the
group
which
formally
launched
in
march
reported
raising
a
little
more
than
through
the
end
of
june
much
of
it
from
california-based
donors
federal
election
commission
records
show
ocasio-cortez
is
one
of
the
house's
most
high-profile
freshmen
and
one-fourth
of
a
quartet
of
freshmen
lawmakers
known
as
the
squad
who
have
clashed
publicly
with
president
donald
trump
minnesota
rep
ilhan
omar
another
member
of
the
so-called
squad
on
friday
called
the
ad
horrifying
to
watch
and
said
it
should
be
pulled
from
the
airwaves
when
will
the
republicans
learn
how
to
offer
ideas
and
solutions
without
stroking
fear
and
inciting
violence
she
tweeted
enough
is
enough
they
need
to
pull
this
garbage
off
the
air
and
issue
an
apology
to
aoc
as
he
gears
up
for
his
reelection
campaign
trump
has
sought
to
closely
tie
democrats
on
capitol
hill
and
those
running
for
the
presidency
to
socialism
and
lawmakers
such
as
ocasio-cortez
