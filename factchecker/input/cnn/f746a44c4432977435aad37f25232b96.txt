trump
rebuts
graham
my
response
to
iran
was
a
sign
of
strength
cnn
president
donald
trump
offered
a
reserved
rebuttal
to
sen
lindsey
graham's
assertion
that
the
administration's
response
to
iran
shooting
down
an
american
drone
earlier
this
summer
was
viewed
as
weakness
with
the
president
calling
his
response
a
sign
of
strength
trump's
tweet
was
an
unusual
rebuke
of
a
strong
congressional
ally
though
much
gentler
than
some
of
his
previous
attacks
on
critics
and
comes
as
sources
tell
cnn
that
no
definitive
us
response
to
this
past
weekend's
attacks
on
saudi
oil
fields
is
expected
until
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
returns
from
his
trip
to
saudi
arabia
that
begins
tuesday
night
graham's
twitter
thread
about
the
attacks
on
saudi
oil
facilities
began
tuesday
with
praise
for
vice
president
mike
pence
after
he
briefed
senate
republicans
the
attack
claimed
by
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
forced
state-owned
saudi
aramco
to
halve
its
production
taking
more
than
of
the
world's
daily
crude
oil
consumption
off
the
global
market
implicating
iran
in
the
attacks
graham
lauded
the
administration's
efforts
to
create
a
regional
coalition
thoroughly
brief
the
congress
on
the
actions
taken
and
come
up
with
a
plan
of
action
to
restore
deterrence
against
an
evil
regime
in
iran
the
south
carolina
republican
then
directly
addressed
trump
writing
the
measured
response
by
president
realdonaldtrump
regarding
the
shooting
down
of
an
american
drone
was
clearly
seen
by
the
iranian
regime
as
a
sign
of
weakness
trump
responded
to
graham's
characterization
on
tuesday
evening
arguing
that
some
had
simply
failed
to
grasp
his
approach
to
iran
no
lindsey
it
was
a
sign
of
strength
that
some
people
just
don't
understand
trump
replied
cnn
reported
on
tuesday
that
while
us
defense
officials
were
ordered
to
plan
potential
responses
to
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
in
a
monday
meeting
with
trump
the
white
house
is
waiting
for
the
kingdom's
rulers
to
decide
on
a
response
before
charting
a
path
forward
two
us
defense
officials
said
the
pentagon
was
instructed
to
plan
at
the
white
house
meeting
but
added
that
no
detailed
choices
were
presented
