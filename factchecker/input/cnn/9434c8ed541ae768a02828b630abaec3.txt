how
to
impeach
a
supreme
court
justice
washington
cnn
several
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
are
calling
for
the
impeachment
of
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
after
a
new
book
provided
unreported
details
of
an
incident
of
alleged
sexual
misconduct
while
he
was
a
student
at
yale
because
justices
receive
lifetime
appointments
removing
one
is
harder
than
just
calling
up
someone
and
firing
them
in
order
to
remove
one
you
have
to
impeach
them
the
process
is
the
same
as
impeaching
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
house
of
representatives
would
vote
on
whether
to
impeach
the
justice
in
question
if
the
justice
is
impeached
there
would
be
a
senate
trial
the
house
needs
only
a
simple
majority
to
impeach
a
supreme
court
justice
or
any
federal
judge
to
convict
and
then
remove
the
justice
or
judge
the
senate
requires
a
two-thirds
majority
in
an
interview
with
wnyc
radio
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
said
he
had
questions
for
fbi
director
christopher
wray
regarding
the
agency's
investigation
of
the
allegations
against
kavanaugh
nadler
has
previously
asked
the
national
archives
to
produce
documents
related
to
kavanaugh's
time
in
the
george
w.
bush
white
house
the
part
of
the
constitution
that
establishes
the
judicial
system
article
iii
leaves
broad
room
for
interpretation
about
how
judges
should
behave
in
their
roles
the
judges
both
of
the
supreme
and
inferior
courts
shall
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior
the
document
states
the
constitution
provides
no
further
guidance
about
how
judges
should
behave
in
office
why
brett
kavanaugh
isn't
going
anywhere
impeachment
and
removal
of
federal
judges
is
extremely
rare
the
house
of
representatives
has
impeached
only
federal
judges
since
and
eight
of
those
impeachments
were
followed
by
convictions
in
the
senate
according
to
new
york
university's
brennan
center
for
justice
samuel
chase
is
the
only
supreme
court
justice
who
was
ever
impeached
in
and
he
was
acquitted
by
the
senate
in
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
senate
