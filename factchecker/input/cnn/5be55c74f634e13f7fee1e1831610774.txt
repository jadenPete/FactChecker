scaramucci
said
president
donald
trump's
remarks
that
the
united
states
is
locked
and
loaded
in
response
to
an
attack
on
saudi
arabian
oil

are

scaramucci
said
trump's
words
are
an
irony
and
will
have
less
and
less
of
an
impact
you
would
want
somebody
in
that
position
that
had
way
more
temperance
you
would
want
somebody
in
that
position
who
understood
as
the
guardian
of
democracy
and
as
a
beacon
of
hope
for
people
scaramucci
a

administration
employee

critic
said
our
grandfathers
through
years
of
good
policy
enabled
the
united
states
as
the
largest
military
in
the
world
and
so
talking
like
that
from
that
position
in
many
ways
is
anti-american
on
saturday
coordinated
strikes
on
saudi
arabian
oil
facilities
disrupted
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
trump
tweeted
on
sunday
that
the
us
has
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
who
is
responsible
for
the
attack
and
the
country
is
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
following
the
strike
saudi
arabia
oil
supply
was
attacked
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
trump
wrote
trump's
tweet
which
appeared
to
raise
the
specter
of
a
us
military
response
served
to
ratchet
up
tensions
in
a
region
already
on
edge
though
the
vice
president's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
told
reporters
monday
morning
that
the
president's
claim
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
may
not
refer
to
military
action
scaramucci
said
on
monday
that
while
the
attacks
on
the
oil
fields
are
a
serious
situation
he
thinks
the
impact
it
will
have
on
the
economy
will
be
slight
i
think
of
the
oil
it's
a
lot
but
i
do
think
the
president
is
making
a
smart
decision
to
release
strategic
petroleum
reserves
if
necessary
my
guess
is
it
won't
be
necessary
it's
just
a
notion
that
that's
going
to
happen
will
calm
down
the
oil
markets
i
think
what's
more
concerning
is
why
those
areas
why
those
refineries
are
not
more
protected
you
have
to
be
worried
about
that
because
it'll
be
future
attacks
