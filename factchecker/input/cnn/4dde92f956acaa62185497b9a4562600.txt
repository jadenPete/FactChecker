saudi
attack
likely
originated
in
iran
or
iraq
senior
administration
official
says
washington
cnn
a
day
after
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
blamed
iran
for
the
attack
on
saudi
oil
facilities
and
argued
there
is
no
evidence
the
attacks
came
from
yemen
a
senior
administration
official
briefed
cnn
on
information
to
back
up
pompeo's
claims
the
official
pointed
to
the
angle
at
which
saudi
oil
facilities
were
attacked
the
numbers
of
points
of
impact
and
other
information
to
argue
that
it
is
unlikely
the
attacks
were
carried
out
by
yemen
instead
the
official
suggested
the
attack
most
likely
originated
in
iran
or
iraq
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
these
things
could
have
come
from
anywhere
but
iran
or
iraq
the
senior
administration
official
said
the
official
said
saudi
targets
were
struck
in
saturday's
attack
and
argued
that
such
an
attack
could
not
be
carried
out
with
drones
which
the
houthis
claimed
to
have
used
you
can't
hit
targets
with
drones
like
that
the
official
said
the
official
drawing
on
commercial
satellite
imagery
shared
with
cnn
also
noted
that
all
the
points
of
impact
on
saudi
facilities
were
on
the
northwest
side
of
them
which
is
somewhat
difficult
to
do
from
yemen
the
official
could
not
say
whether
it's
possible
drones
from
yemen
could
have
angled
around
to
attack
northwest
facilities
citing
a
potential
impact
on
oil
prices
because
of
the
attack
president
donald
trump
tweeted
sunday
that
he
authorized
the
release
of
oil
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
if
needed
in
a
to-be-determined
amount
sufficient
to
keep
the
markets
well-supplied
the
private
satellite
images
come
at
a
time
of
escalating
tension
between
iran
and
the
us
following
a
series
of
other
provocations
in
recent
months
notably
tehran
shooting
down
a
us
drone
aircraft
in
june
paired
with
an
increased
american
military
presence
in
the
region
the
confrontations
have
raised
fears
that
a
conflict
between
the
two
countries
could
spiral
on
saturday
coordinated
strikes
on
key
saudi
arabian
oil
facilities
among
the
world's
largest
energy
production
centers
disrupted
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
yemen's
houthi
rebels
took
responsibility
for
the
attacks
but
they
are
often
backed
by
iran
preliminary
indications
even
before
commercial
images
of
the
oil
processing
plant
were
released
suggested
the
attack
did
not
originate
from
yemen
and
likely
originated
from
iraq
according
to
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
incident
the
same
official
said
the
damage
was
caused
by
an
armed
drone
attack
three
cnn
military
experts
have
examined
the
private
satellite
photos
ret
col
cedric
leighton
who
is
an
intelligence
expert
with
a
focus
in
imagery
said
the
images
do
help
support
the
trump
administration's
claim
that
the
drones
likely
came
from
iraq
or
iran
but
cautioned
that
they're
not
definitive
this
is
the
handiwork
of
a
sophisticated
most
likely
state
actor
the
precise
nature
of
the
intelligence
used
to
conduct
targeting
the
mission
planning
that
went
into
this
to
avoid
radar
detection
as
well
as
the
selection
of
the
targets
shows
a
robust
capability
that
would
most
likely
be
the
work
of
a
government
or
government-sponsored
group
leighton
told
cnn
sunday
the
drones
most
likely
originated
in
either
southern
iraq
or
iran
he
said
ret
gen
mark
hertling
said
the
images
really
don't
show
anything
other
than
pretty
good
accuracy
on
the
strike
of
the
oil
tanks
ret
adm
john
kirby
echoed
this
point
stating
there
is
nothing
i
see
in
these
pictures
which
confirms
a
launch
from
any
particular
location
i'm
struck
by
the
precision
of
the
strikes
almost
pin-prick
kirby
said
certainly
possible
with
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
but
again
that
doesn't
really
confirm
anything
the
senior
administration
official
pointed
to
open
source
reports
that
kuwait
detected
a
drone
in
its
airspace
prior
to
the
attack
in
saudi
arabia
and
noted
that
the
iraqis
have
been
very
explicit
that
the
attack
did
not
originate
in
their
airspace
suggesting
iran
was
the
most
likely
point
of
origin
if
this
was
a
military
offensive
launched
from
iran
to
saudi
arabia
that
is
extremely
serious
the
official
said
the
official
declined
to
say
what
retaliatory
options
the
administration
was
considering
and
said
that
the
president
wants
all
options
on
the
table
the
official
also
pointed
to
saudi
intelligence
suggesting
a
possible
cruise
missile
attack
but
said
the
us
had
not
yet
corroborated
that
information
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
did
not
specifically
reference
the
attack
on
the
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
in
an
address
on
iran's
press
tv
sunday
but
did
accuse
americans
of
running
a
war
operation
by
supporting
the
uae
and
saudi
arabia
transferring
weapons
and
providing
intelligence
what
is
happening
in
this
region
today
has
created
concern
among
majority
of
world
countries
he
said
earlier
sunday
white
house
senior
counselor
kellyanne
conway
said
trump
has
many
options
on
the
table
when
it
comes
to
responding
to
the
strike
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
production
this
weekend
the
president
will
always
consider
his
options
conway
said
on
fox
news
sunday
when
asked
if
trump
would
still
sit
down
with
rouhani
under
current
circumstances
we've
never
committed
to
that
meeting
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
the
president's
just
said
he's
looking
at
it
when
you
attack
saudi
arabia
you're
not
helping
your
case
much
she
added
after
pompeo
pinned
the
blame
on
iran
for
the
attack
on
saturday
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
seyyed
abbas
mousavi
rejected
the
accusation
labeling
it
inappropriate
such
blind
accusations
and
inappropriate
comments
in
a
diplomatic
context
are
incomprehensible
and
meaningless
he
said
adding
even
hostility
needs
a
certain
degree
of
credibility
and
reasonable
frameworks
us
officials
have
also
violated
these
basic
principles
