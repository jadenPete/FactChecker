trump's
struggle
with
iran
policy
continues
without
bolton
replacement
was
bolton
more
influential
on
fox
than
in

washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
is
confronting
another
crisis
in
the
middle
east
this
week
without
a
permanent
national
security
adviser
a
role
he
hopes
to
fill
with
someone
who
shares
his
foreign
policy
views
at
a
moment
they
appear
newly
muddled
since
firing
john
bolton
by
tweet
a
week
ago
trump
has
interviewed
or
spoken
with
several
candidates
for
the
job
according
to
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
speaking
to
reporters
aboard
air
force
one
on
tuesday
the
president
named
five
of
them
they
include
a
former
deputy
national
security
adviser
who
is
well-liked
inside
the
pentagon
the
hostage
negotiator
trump
personally
dispatched
to
help
free
a
us
rapper
from
swedish
prison
the
top
foreign
policy
aide
to
the
vice
president
the
energy
department's
top
nuclear
official
and
a
well-known
former
government
official
who
appears
frequently
on
cable
news
the
president
hasn't
made
a
final
decision
and
later
his
press
secretary
said
there
were
some
names
the
president
did
not
list
who
are
under
consideration
the
job
opening
provides
trump
an
opportunity
to
name
someone
more
likeminded
but
a
crisis
over
saudi
oil
fields
that
were
brazenly
attacked
this
weekend
lays
bare
his
dueling
instincts
in
the
region
inclinations
that
ended
bolton's
tenure
and
are
bound
to
complicate
his
replacement's
trump
is
trapped
between
two
impulses
on
iran
following
the
attacks
trump
huddled
at
the
white
house
on
sunday
and
monday
with
his
national
security
team
including
the
bolton
deputy
who
is
now
filling
the
adviser
role
in
an
acting
capacity
other
senior
officials
have
also
taken
a
lead
in
coordinating
a
us
response
to
the
attacks
including
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
is
expected
to
travel
to
saudi
arabia
this
week
at
trump's
behest
in
the
sessions
officials
presented
trump
with
his
military
and
nonmilitary
options
including
new
sanctions
according
to
an
administration
official
in
mulling
his
options
for
responding
trump
finds
himself
drawn
in
opposing
directions
while
he
has
long
sought
to
appear
strong
on
iran
he
has
promised
voters
he
won't
be
drawn
into
another
middle
east
war
and
says
he's
open
to
talking
some
of
those
in
this
week's
meetings
have
included
potential
successors
to
bolton
an
iran
hawk
who
departed
partly
over
disagreements
on
the
issue
in
his
interviews
and
in
interactions
over
the
past
days
trump
has
sought
to
gauge
whether
those
vying
for
the
post
agree
with
his
overarching
view
that
the
united
states
should
limit
its
activities
abroad
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
seeking
input
administration
considers
double-tapping
pompeo
for
national
security
adviser
trump
has
solicited
recommendations
on
the
selection
from
advisers
and
friends
but
officials
said
he
would
likely
rely
principally
on
advice
from
pompeo
whose
stature
in
the
administration
has
increased
trump
said
last
week
that
he'd
asked
his
chief
diplomat
if
he
was
interested
in
also
taking
on
the
national
security
adviser
job
but
that
he
had
declined
trump
could
look
to
choose
someone
with
a
lower
profile
than
bolton
who
was
a
television
commentator
before
the
president
hired
him
according
to
one
source
familiar
with
the
process
who
cited
trump's
tendency
to
overcompensate
in
reaction
to
events
like
bolton's
ouster
in
that
scenario
the
job
would
appear
more
like
a
traditional
staffer
while
trump
said
in
his
tweet
dismissing
bolton
that
he'd
name
a
new
national
security
adviser
this
week
white
house
officials
have
been
more
circumspect
in
the
timing
of
an
announcement
it's
not
clear
whether
a
new
adviser
will
be
in
place
when
trump
travels
next
week
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
or
for
a
state
visit
on
friday
by
australia's
prime
minister
i'm
not
sure
when
he's
going
to
name
that
person
spokesman
hogan
gidley
told
cnn
at
the
white
house
on
tuesday
there
are
a
lot
of
folks
who
want
that
position
he's
been
in
talks
with
many
of
those
people
he
wants
to
make
this
a
really
strong
pick
to
protect
the
american
people
but
also
to
carry
out
his
policies
and
that
was
something
that
wasn't
happening
some
lawmakers
have
already
expressed
concern
that
trump
is
confronting
increased
tensions
in
the
middle
east
without
a
national
security
adviser
or
the
seasoned
military
officials
who
once
populated
his
cabinet
i'm
not
encouraged
because
frankly
some
of
the
people
i
wish
were
there
i
wish
jim
mattis
was
in
the
room
right
now
i
wish
h.r.
mcmaster
was
in
the
room
said
sen
angus
king
of
maine
naming
the
generals
who
once
served
as
trump's
defense
secretary
and
his
second
national
security
adviser
he
doesn't
even
have
a
national
security
adviser
so
that's
a
worry
king
an
independent
who
caucuses
with
democrats
said
on
cnn's
new
day
this
is
a
decision
that
should
be
based
upon
a
lot
of
consultation
with
allies
and
with
advisers
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
taking
place
vacancies
pompeo
reacts
to
bolton
firing
i'm
never
surprised
it's
not
the
only
area
trump
is
relying
on
acting
officials
he
entered
hurricane
season
without
a
permanent
federal
emergency
management
agency
administrator
or
a
confirmed
secretary
of
homeland
security
as
he
looks
for
someone
to
replace
bolton
who
clashed
with
pompeo
and
other
members
of
the
national
security
apparatus
trump
hopes
to
find
an
individual
willing
to
carry
out
his
policy
directives
and
defend
them
on
television
he's
interviewed
ricky
waddell
who
acted
as
a
deputy
to
mcmaster
and
is
now
assistant
to
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
waddell
enjoys
support
inside
the
pentagon
and
from
pompeo
who
has
also
voiced
support
for
robert
o'brien
the
trump
administration
hostage
negotiator
who
interviewed
for
the
post
last
week
trump
said
as
he
flew
between
albuquerque
and
silicon
valley
on
tuesday
that
he
liked
waddell
a
lot
and
that
o'brien
is
fantastic
other
officials
being
considered
include
keith
kellogg
the
national
security
adviser
to
vice
president
mike
pence
i
love
keith
kellogg
keith
kellogg
he's
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
he's
great
trump
said
lisa
e.
gordon-hagerty
the
current
under
secretary
for
nuclear
security
at
the
energy
department
and
fred
fleitz
a
former
cia
analyst
who
served
as
chief
of
staff
of
the
national
security
council
last
year
rounded
out
trump's
list
other
officials
believed
to
be
under
consideration
include
the
us
special
envoy
for
iran
brian
hook
who
is
close
to
trump's
senior
adviser
and
son-in-law
jared
kushner
but
who
was
criticized
as
a
never
trumper
by
other
advisers
trump
had
also
been
considering
rob
blair
a
national
security
aide
to
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
who
is
nonetheless
considered
a
long
shot
inside
the
west
wing
confusing
messages
trump
picks
words
carefully
when
questioned
about
iran
even
as
he
searches
for
a
national
security
adviser
more
aligned
with
his
stance
trump
has
sent
confusing
messages
about
his
goals
abroad
and
contradicted
some
of
his
most
senior
aides
the
inconsistencies
expose
the
hazards
for
any
potential
national
security
adviser
hoping
to
help
trump
shape
his
foreign
policy
ahead
of
the
presidential
election
after
declaring
sunday
that
the
us
was
locked
and
loaded
to
respond
to
the
attack
on
saudi
oil
fields
trump
appeared
more
restrained
a
day
later
saying
he
did
not
want
war
and
after
top
advisers
including
pompeo
named
iran
as
the
culprit
trump
appeared
less
certain
saying
he
was
waiting
for
the
final
intelligence
reports
to
assign
blame
he
was
also
directly
at
odds
with
pompeo
and
himself
when
he
claimed
it
was
wrong
to
say
he
would
meet
without
conditions
with
iranian
leaders
something
he
had
said
himself
on
two
occasions
that
he
would
do
and
that
his
top
diplomat
repeated
often
he's
not
expected
to
decide
on
a
response
until
his
secretary
of
state
returns
from
the
region
according
to
administration
officials
trump
has
yet
to
assign
firm
blame
on
iran
saying
he's
waiting
for
the
saudis
to
name
the
culprit
themselves
after
two
days
of
sometimes
opposing
messages
administration
officials
on
tuesday
seemed
careful
to
strike
a
middle
ground
trump
is
not
going
to
take
anything
off
the
table
or
put
anything
on
the
table
gidley
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
pence
speaking
at
the
conservative
heritage
foundation
sought
to
distill
trump's
message
i
promise
you
we're
ready
as
the
president
said
we
don't
want
war
with
anybody
but
the
united
states
is
prepared
we're
locked
and
loaded
and
we're
ready
to
defend
our
interests
and
our
allies
in
the
region
make
no
mistake
about
it
he
said
