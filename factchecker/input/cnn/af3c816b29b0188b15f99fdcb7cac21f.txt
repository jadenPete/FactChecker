night
with
president
donald
trump
and
richard
grenell
the
us
ambassador

according
to
two
administration
sources
otto
warmbier
was
an
american
college
student
who
was
held
prisoner
for
months
by
pyongyang
and
died
shortly
after
he
was
returned
home
in
a
comatose
state
in
it's
unclear
how
saturday's
dinner
was
planned
and
whether
anyone
else
will
join
them
a
spokesman
for
the
national
security
council
did
not
provide
a
comment
grenell
has
been
in
washington
for
the
last
few
days
and
is
one
of
the
many
contenders
eyeing
the
national
security
adviser
job
the
sources
say
but
this
dinner
was
planned
before
john
bolton
was
fired
earlier
this
week
grenell
met
with
the
warmbiers
when
they
visited
germany
in
august
he
posted
a
photo
of
himself
with
cindy
warmbier
and
his
own
mother
on
instagram
today
i
introduced
otto
warmbier's
mother
cindy
to
my
mom
judi
cindy
is
focused
on
bringing
some
justice
to
her
family
and
we
are
ready
to
help
grenell
wrote
in
his
caption
for
the
photo
after
a
second
summit
with
kim
jong
un
in
hanoi
vietnam
earlier
this
year
trump
said
he
does
not
hold
the
north
korean
dictator
responsible
for
warmbier's
death
the
warmbiers
rejected
trump's
remark
we
have
been
respectful
during
this
summit
process
now
we
must
speak
out
kim
and
his
evil
regime
are
responsible
for
the
death
of
our
son
otto
kim
and
his
evil
regime
are
responsible
for
unimaginable
cruelty
and
inhumanity
no
excuses
or
lavish
praise
can
change
that
thank
you
the
warmbiers
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
earlier
this
week
trump
criticized
bolton
for
earlier
comments
he
had
made
regarding
north
korean
denuclearization
that
angered
kim
jong
un
he's
using
that
to
make
a
deal
with
north
korea
and
i
don't
blame
kim
jong
un
for
what
he
said
after
that
and
he
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
john
bolton
and
that's
not
a
question
of
being
tough
that's
a
question
of
being
not
smart
to
say
something
like
that
trump
said
