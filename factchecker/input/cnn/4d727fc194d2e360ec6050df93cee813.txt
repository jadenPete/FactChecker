what's
new
and
dangerous
in
corey
lewandowski's
open
embrace
of
lying
cnn
on
the
cusp
of
announcing
whether
he
will
run
for
the
senate
in
corey
lewandowski
is
openly
embracing
his
common
practice
of
lying
to
the
media
wearing
it
as
a
sort
of
badge
of
honor
as
he
prepares
to
court
republican
primary
voters
in
new
hampshire
i
have
no
obligation
to
be
honest
with
the
media
lewandowski
said
with
a
straight
face
when
under
questioning
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
when
he
had
told
msnbc
in
february
that
he
didn't
recall
ever
having
a
conversation
with
president
donald
trump
about
the
possible
un-recusal
of
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
in
the
special
counsel
probe
into
russian
interference
the
mueller
report
made
clear
that
lewandowski
had
in
fact
had
that
conversation
with
trump
on
at
least
two
occasions
on
wednesday
morning
lewandowski
doubled
down
on
that
idea
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
new
day
i'm
as
honest
as
i
can
be
as
often
as
i
can
lewandowski
said
which
well
hell
there's
no
question
that
trump
has
redefined
the
idea
of
how
much
or
how
little
a
politician
has
to
tell
the
truth
while
all
politicians
prior
to
trump
told
some
fibs
that
a
generally
kept
them
to
a
minimum
and
b
if
called
out
on
the
mischaracterization
or
exaggeration
by
the
media
they
backed
off
not
so
with
trump
not
only
has
he
said
more
than
false
or
misleading
things
since
coming
into
office
according
to
the
washington
post's
fact
checker
blog
but
he
has
also
repeated
some
of
those
false
claims
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
trump
has
wrongly
claimed
that
the
southern
border
wall
is
being
built
more
than
times
he
simply
bulls
his
way
past
the
truth
and
those
seeking
to
enforce
it
the
truth
in
trump's
mind
is
whatever
he
says
it
is
stick
with
us
don't
believe
the
crap
you
see
from
these
people
the
fake
news
trump
told
an
audience
in
what
you're
seeing
and
what
you're
reading
is
not
what's
happening
what
lewandowski
a
trump
acolyte
and
always
the
most
loyal
soldier
in
the
president's
political
army
is
doing
is
actually
taking
the
trump
theory
of
truth
a
step
further
where
trump
seems
content
to
simply
work
to
erode
confidence
in
the
media's
ability
to
tell
the
truth
fake
news
and
all
that
lewandowski
is
actively
celebrating
his
lack
of
truthfulness
with
the
media
as
evidence
of
just
how
hardcore
trump
he
actually
is
what
i'm
saying
is
they
have
been
inaccurate
on
many
occasions
and
perhaps
i
was
inaccurate
that
time
lewandowski
told
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
tuesday
the
logic
behind
that
statement
goes
like
this
the
media
gets
stuff
wrong
so
i
am
perfectly
within
my
rights
to
purposely
obfuscate
or
even
lie
to
the
media
it's
just
giving
them
a
taste
of
their
own
medicine
the
fundamental
flaws
in
that
logic
are
myriad
first
and
foremost
we
teach
our
children
that
lying
or
willfully
misrepresenting
things
is
wrong
and
should
never
be
done
if
it's
good
enough
to
teach
our
kids
we
should
be
able
to
follow
it
too
second
lewandowski
is
comparing
apples
to
oranges
yes
the
media
get
things
wrong
from
time
to
time
as
any
entity
populated
by
fallible
humans
will
do
but
those
errors
are
of
the
time
honest
mistakes
not
willful
attempts
to
mislead
the
public
and
there
is
a
long-held
practice
in
the
media
that
when
you
get
something
wrong
a
you
correct
it
publicly
and
b
if
it's
a
big
enough
thing
people
lose
their
jobs
it's
called
accountability
what
lewandowski
is
doing
when
he
knowingly
lies
to
the
media
bears
zero
resemblance
to
that
accountability
idea
he
is
purposely
not
telling
the
truth
to
benefit
himself
and
his
own
political
interests
and
he
isn't
ever
apologizing
for
getting
it
wrong
he's
reveling
in
it
trump
allies
and
lewandowski
supporters
will
cast
all
of
this
as
the
media
being
mad
when
lewandowski
dunks
on
them
which
is
dumb
because
consider
this
when
lewandwoski
lies
to
the
media
the
media
broadcasts
those
lies
to
the
public
so
in
the
process
of
lying
to
journalists
lewandowski
is
lying
to
the
public
which
is
a
pretty
big
self
own
