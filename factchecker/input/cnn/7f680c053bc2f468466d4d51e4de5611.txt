how
the
corey
lewandowski
circus
makes
impeachment
even
less
likely
cnn
impeaching
donald
trump
has
always
been
a
long
shot
but
never
more
so
than
after
the
debacle
that
was
the
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
featuring
corey
lewandowski
on
tuesday
from
the
start
the
hearing
which
was
the
first
conducted
under
the
rules
of
an
impeachment
investigation
was
everything
people
hate
about
politics
lewandowski
who
ran
president
donald
trump's
campaign
for
a
time
was
a
decidedly
hostile
witness
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-new
york
seemed
flummoxed
by
lewandowski's
intransigence
the
proceedings
were
stopped
while
someone
provided
lewandowski
a
copy
of
the
mueller
report
ranking
member
doug
collins
r-georgia
claimed
that
there
were
serious
ethics
breaches
occurring
in
nadler's
use
of
more
than
five
minutes
to
question
the
witness
rep
hank
johnson
d-georgia
compared
lewandowski
to
a
fish
being
gutted
with
a
spoon
it
was
a
mess
a
circus
undignified
unwatchable
i
get
paid
to
watch
so
i
watched
it
was
also
a
preview
of
what
a
full-blown
effort
to
impeach
trump
might
look
like
and
just
how
destructive
politically
speaking
such
an
effort
would
be
start
here
a
majority
of
the
democratic
house
caucus
and
counting
are
now
on
the
record
in
support
of
beginning
impeachment
proceedings
against
trump
but
speaker
nancy
pelosi
of
california
continues
to
be
firmly
against
the
idea
insisting
that
trying
to
impeach
trump
plays
right
into
the
president's
hands
especially
given
that
there
simply
aren't
the
votes
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
to
remove
the
president
even
if
he
is
impeached
by
the
house
the
point
what's
new
and
dangerous
in
corey
lewandowski's
open
embrace
of
lying
pelosi's
stance
is
informed
at
least
in
part
by
polling
that
suggests
a
majority
of
americans
simply
do
not
believe
trump
should
be
impeached
a
monmouth
university
poll
conducted
last
month
showed
that
nearly
in
people
oppose
the
impeachment
and
removal
of
trump
that
finding
is
broadly
consistent
with
lots
and
lots
of
other
polling
data
that
shows
that
while
trump
is
not
popular
neither
is
impeaching
him
the
conundrum
for
pelosi
and
the
democratic
party
more
broadly
is
also
contained
within
that
monmouth
poll
of
self-identified
democrats
support
impeachment
and
removal
for
trump
so
the
public
at
large
is
clearly
opposed
to
impeachment
but
the
party's
liberal
base
wants
it
and
pelosi
has
found
herself
stuck
between
scylla
and
charybdis
tuesday's
disaster
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
almost
certainly
makes
pelosi's
life
a
bit
easier
at
least
for
the
near
future
no
one
not
even
the
staunchest
liberal
who
wanted
trump
impeached
the
day
after
he
was
sworn
in
could
look
at
what
happened
on
tuesday
and
think
oh
yeah
the
american
people
will
definitely
react
well
to
months
and
months
of
this
sort
of
stuff
on
their
tvs
not
one
person
what
the
political
impact
of
the
circus
that
impeachment
would
be
is
difficult
to
predict
exactly
but
what
we
know
judging
from
tuesday
is
that
it
would
be
a
circus
republicans
would
not
play
nice
they
would
obstruct
and
fight
and
engage
in
political
point-scoring
the
likes
of
which
we
haven't
seen
since
the
last
time
the
house
tried
to
impeach
a
president
back
in
the
late
s
in
short
impeachment
proceedings
would
turn
washington
into
a
blood
bath
for
the
next
months
and
the
blood
would
splatter
on
everyone
republican
democrat
liberal
moderate
and
conservative
no
one
would
be
spared
the
point
corey
lewandowski
is
trolling
to
please
donald
trump
and
if
past
is
prologue
that
sort
of
pox
on
all
of
your
houses
could
well
serve
the
political
interests
of
none
other
than
donald
john
trump
trump's
greatest
strength
politically
speaking
is
that
he
remains
perceived
as
a
political
outsider
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
well
president
the
more
he
can
portray
the
coming
election
as
an
us
vs
them
where
the
them
is
washington
elites
bent
on
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
stop
him
from
accomplishing
his
agenda
for
the
american
people
the
better
for
his
chances
remember
this
too
given
trump's
lowly
job
approval
numbers
his
only
path
to
victory
is
by
painting
himself
as
the
devil
you
know
you
might
not
like
him
personally
but
you
know
what
you
are
getting
goes
that
argument
the
more
down
in
the
mud
the
democrats
and
by
extension
their
eventual
nominee
get
the
easier
it
is
for
trump
to
make
that
case
tuesday's
hearing
was
everything
that
people
of
all
political
stripes
hate
about
washington
that
it
turned
and
turned
quickly
into
such
a
farce
should
give
democrats
significant
pause
as
they
way
whether
or
not
to
head
down
the
impeachment
road
