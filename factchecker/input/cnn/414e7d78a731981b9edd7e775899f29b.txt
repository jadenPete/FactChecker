elizabeth
warren
proposes
major
expansion
of
social
security
cnn
sen
elizabeth
warren
on
thursday
unveiled
a
proposal
to
overhaul
and
expand
social
security
beefing
up
benefits
with
a
hike
in
payroll
and
investment
incomes
taxes
on
some
of
the
country's
wealthiest
households
the
massachusetts
democrat's
plan
would
make
major
changes
to
the
popular
entitlement
program
which
currently
provides
monthly
payments
to
roughly
million
americans
most
significantly
it
would
immediately
boost
benefits
by
a
month
for
every
social
security
recipient
if
the
plan
were
implemented
next
year
the
typical
beneficiary
would
receive
a
month
rather
than
it
would
also
increase
monthly
payments
by
for
certain
supplemental
security
income
recipients
who
are
low-income
seniors
or
people
with
disabilities
the
plan
fits
into
the
presidential
candidate's
broader
message
demanding
big
structural
change
to
large
parts
of
the
american
economy
and
would
take
significant
steps
in
an
attempt
to
address
a
legacy
of
inequality
that
she
said
in
a
medium
post
has
hit
older
women
and
people
of
color
the
hardest
by
supplementing
and
growing
the
program
warren
is
also
making
another
play
to
increase
her
support
among
older
voters
the
americans
who
most
reliably
go
to
the
polls
on
election
days
the
plan
arrives
just
hours
before
thursday
night's
democratic
presidential
debate
in
houston
which
could
spur
more
in-depth
discussions
before
a
national
audience
warren's
proposal
does
more
than
simply
offer
more
generous
benefits
it
also
fundamentally
changes
how
social
security
is
funded
a
move
that
while
drastically
broadening
its
scope
could
stoke
opposition
among
the
highest
earners
who
under
the
rewritten
formula
would
have
to
pay
much
more
into
the
system
than
they
are
paid
out
as
part
of
her
vision
for
guaranteeing
benefits
that
come
closer
to
matching
the
costs
often
incurred
by
older
americans
warren
like
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
would
change
the
inflation
measure
used
to
calculate
the
program's
annual
cost-of-living
adjustment
she
would
shift
it
to
one
that
focuses
more
directly
on
the
elderly
taking
into
account
that
seniors
spend
more
on
health
care
the
cost
of
which
typically
rises
more
than
other
goods
and
services
the
two
democratic
candidates
proposals
are
the
most
significant
effort
to
reshape
social
security
since
former
president
george
w.
bush
tried
to
introduce
private
investment
accounts
into
the
system
in
warren's
plan
calls
for
ending
two
provisions
the
windfall
elimination
provision
and
government
pension
offset
that
reduce
social
security
benefits
for
many
former
state
and
local
workers
with
pensions
and
their
families
this
measure
would
increase
benefits
for
more
than
million
former
public-sector
workers
and
their
families
a
generation
of
stagnant
wages
and
rising
costs
for
basics
like
housing
health
care
education
and
child
care
have
squeezed
family
budgets
warren
wrote
millions
of
families
have
had
to
sacrifice
saving
for
retirement
just
to
make
ends
meet
at
the
same
time
fewer
people
have
access
to
the
kind
of
pensions
that
used
to
help
fund
a
comfortable
retirement
bernie
sanders
wants
to
save
social
security
by
raising
taxes
on
people
making
more
than
the
plan
would
augment
payments
to
surviving
spouses
in
two-earner
households
children
who
are
full-time
students
up
to
age
with
a
parent
who
has
disabilities
or
has
died
and
widows
and
widowers
with
disabilities
additionally
it
would
provide
credits
to
caregivers
and
those
in
job-training
programs
which
would
increase
their
average
lifetime
earnings
used
to
calculate
their
social
security
benefits
warren
argues
that
the
caregiver
credit
will
particularly
help
lower-income
women
people
of
color
and
recent
immigrants
for
every
month
of
caregiving
that
meets
these
requirements
the
caregiver
will
be
credited
for
social
security
purposes
with
a
month
of
income
equal
to
the
monthly
average
of
that
year's
median
annual
wage
warren
wrote
those
credits
would
be
unlimited
and
people
can
claim
these
credits
retroactively
if
they
have
done
this
kind
of
caregiving
work
in
the
last
five
years
warren's
blueprint
got
a
stamp
of
approval
from
the
advocacy
group
social
security
works
which
lauded
its
potential
effects
on
current
and
future
recipients
she
knows
that
caregivers
disproportionately
women
who
take
time
out
of
the
workforce
to
care
for
loved
ones
provide
invaluable
work
for
their
families
and
the
nation
nancy
altman
the
president
of
social
security
works
said
in
a
statement
her
plan
gives
those
family
caregivers
credit
towards
their
future
social
security
benefits
so
that
those
who
perform
this
essential
work
will
have
the
secure
retirements
they
have
earned
to
pay
for
it
all
warren
once
again
turns
to
the
wealthy
she
would
impose
a
payroll
tax
on
wages
above
split
between
employees
and
employers
this
would
affect
less
than
the
top
of
earners
she
says
sanders
social
security
plan
would
target
the
same
earners
but
raises
the
tax
rate
slightly
less
to
also
split
between
workers
and
their
employers
his
legislation
would
increase
benefits
for
all
recipients
with
low-income
seniors
receiving
a
boost
of
nearly
a
year
that
is
the
rate
currently
levied
on
the
first
of
wages
with
workers
and
their
employers
each
paying
plus
warren
would
create
a
new
tax
on
a
portion
of
investment
income
for
individuals
making
more
than
or
families
making
more
than
a
year
sanders
plan
which
he
rolled
out
earlier
this
year
would
impose
a
new
tax
on
single
people
with
investment
income
above
and
couples
taking
in
more
than
overall
warren's
plan
would
extend
the
solvency
of
the
social
security
trust
fund
to
or
nearly
more
years
according
to
an
analysis
by
mark
zandi
chief
economist
at
moody's
analytics
currently
the
social
security
administration's
actuaries
predict
that
the
program's
trust
fund
will
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
full
benefits
by
the
sanders
bill
would
add
about
years
to
that
projection
zandi
found
that
warren's
improvements
in
benefits
would
lift
an
estimated
million
elderly
people
out
of
poverty
and
would
increase
the
average
social
security
benefit
for
those
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
income
distribution
by
nearly
those
in
the
top
of
earners
would
see
payments
edge
up
by
less
than
meanwhile
the
top
of
earners
would
be
hit
with
about
more
in
payroll
taxes
annually
and
those
in
the
next
would
pay
just
over
more
a
year
zandi
said
however
zandi
warns
a
number
of
warren's
economic
policy
proposals
including
affordable
housing
student
lending
and
child
care
are
also
financed
by
raising
taxes
on
the
rich
this
could
prompt
them
to
make
changes
that
could
lower
the
amount
of
revenue
the
proposals
raise
