debates
confirm
there
is
really
only
one
issue
in
the
democratic
primary
cnn
a
lack
of
agreement
and
a
crush
of
urgency
make
health
care
coverage
the
most
important
issue
in
the
democratic
primary
disagreements
among
the
candidates
have
largely
been
focused
at
the
three
primary
debates
on
how
to
go
about
giving
every
american
health
insurance
and
how
to
pay
for
it
on
other
issues
there
are
differences
around
the
edges
and
some
have
more
and
grander
plans
than
others
but
they
all
largely
agree
that
something
drastic
and
immediate
needs
to
be
done
about
climate
change
they
all
want
to
take
on
the
national
rifle
association
they
all
very
very
much
want
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
but
they
are
completely
split
on
what
to
do
about
health
insurance
and
that
just
happens
to
be
among
the
top
issues
for
voters
at
large
and
most
especially
democratic
voters
in
a
cnn
poll
conducted
by
ssrs
in
september
of
democratic
and
democratic-leaning
registered
voters
said
health
care
was
either
extremely
or
very
important
smaller
though
still
large
percentages
said
the
same
of
climate
change
gun
policy
and
the
economy
takeaways
from
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
for
republicans
and
republican-leaning
registered
voters
health
care
was
just
the
fourth
most-cited
issue
of
them
said
health
care
was
either
extremely
or
very
important
to
their
votes
for
president
fewer
republicans
cited
health
care
than
cited
the
economy
immigration
and
gun
policy
but
while
democrats
candidates
and
voters
almost
universally
agree
that
health
care
is
an
important
issue
they
seem
hopelessly
split
on
what
to
do
about
it
in
a
pew
survey
in
july
of
americans
said
the
government
has
a
responsibility
to
make
sure
americans
have
health
care
coverage
compared
with
who
said
the
government
does
not
but
there
is
a
massive
partisan
split
just
of
republicans
and
republican-leaning
adults
in
the
poll
said
the
government
has
a
responsibility
compared
with
of
democrats
and
democratic-leaning
adults
and
that's
just
where
the
disagreements
get
started
while
most
republicans
don't
want
the
government
involved
in
health
insurance
of
them
say
medicare
should
be
continued
the
largest
bloc
of
democrats
and
democratic-leaners
say
there
should
be
a
single
national
government
health
insurance
program
ala
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
and
medicare
for
all
but
a
large
and
important
of
democrats
say
there
should
be
a
mix
of
government
and
private
programs
ala
joe
biden
amy
klobuchar
pete
buttigieg
and
beto
o'rourke
add
to
all
of
this
the
party's
history
with
the
issue
when
president
barack
obama
swept
into
office
in
with
a
filibuster-proof
senate
majority
and
after
spending
a
fair
amount
of
political
capital
to
help
an
economy
reeling
from
the
great
recession
he
and
democrats
spent
all
they
had
left
passing
the
affordable
care
act
without
any
help
from
republicans
they
cobbled
together
votes
among
democrats
for
what
became
known
as
obamacare
despite
no
end
of
trying
they
were
unable
to
add
a
public
health
insurance
option
for
people
not
eligible
for
medicare
they
had
to
bend
senate
rules
to
get
the
thing
passed
and
then
they
lost
the
house
of
representatives
and
have
spent
every
year
since
trying
to
protect
the
law
from
republican
assault
that
means
what
they
passed
in
though
flawed
has
been
frozen
in
time
sanders
by
the
way
was
among
the
liberals
in
who
supported
the
affordable
care
act
only
grudgingly
to
get
something
anything
done
back
then
it's
led
to
a
primary
in
which
every
candidate
wants
more
government
involvement
in
the
health
insurance
market
but
there
are
growing
and
heated
disagreements
over
how
the
candidates
are
all
deferential
to
the
legacy
of
obama
while
arguing
that
his
signature
achievement
is
either
hopelessly
flawed
completely
inadequate
and
must
be
replaced
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
government
plan
for
everyone
or
at
the
very
least
in
need
of
a
major
overhaul
here
in
four
quotes
from
a
transcript
of
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
is
the
difference
in
the
party
half
of
which
wants
to
start
over
with
medicare
for
all
and
half
of
which
wants
to
improve
the
affordable
care
act
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
wants
to
make
private
insurance
more
affordable
i
know
that
the
senator
warren
says
she's
for
bernie
well
i'm
for
barack
i
think
the
obamacare
worked
i
think
the
way
we
add
to
it
replace
everything
that
has
been
cut
add
a
public
option
guarantee
that
everyone
will
be
able
to
have
affordable
insurance
number
one
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
private
insurance
i've
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
i've
met
people
who
like
their
doctors
i've
met
people
who
like
their
nurses
i've
met
people
who
like
their
pharmacists
i've
met
people
who
like
their
physical
therapists
what
they
want
is
access
to
health
care
and
we
just
need
to
be
clear
about
what
medicare
for
all
is
all
about
instead
of
paying
premiums
into
insurance
companies
and
then
having
insurance
companies
build
their
profits
by
saying
no
to
coverage
we're
going
to
do
this
by
saying
everyone
is
covered
by
medicare
for
all
every
health
care
provider
is
covered
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
who
wants
to
bring
the
us
in
line
with
other
countries
americans
don't
want
to
pay
twice
as
much
as
other
countries
and
they
guarantee
health
care
to
all
people
under
my
medicare
for
all
proposal
when
you
don't
pay
out
of
pocket
and
you
don't
pay
premiums
maybe
you've
run
into
people
who
love
their
premiums
i
haven't
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
who
doesn't
want
to
force
americans
into
any
particular
health
plan
the
problem
sen
sanders
with
that
damn
bill
that
you
wrote
and
that
sen
warren
backs
is
that
it
doesn't
trust
the
american
people
i
trust
you
to
choose
what
makes
the
most
sense
for
you
not
my
way
or
the
highway
and
this
doesn't
even
get
to
the
issue
of
how
to
pay
for
these
plans
which
is
another
key
difference
biden
and
others
argue
that
taxes
will
go
up
sanders
and
warren
argue
that
premiums
will
go
down
canceling
that
out
the
math
all
gets
very
fuzzy
but
and
this
might
be
more
of
a
general
election
discussion
but
neither
a
public
option
nor
medicare
for
all
seems
very
likely
to
pass
through
a
republican-controlled
senate
it
won't
even
be
a
discussion
if
trump
is
reelected
so
there's
a
good
chance
that
the
entire
health
care
disagreement
among
democrats
might
end
up
being
academic
