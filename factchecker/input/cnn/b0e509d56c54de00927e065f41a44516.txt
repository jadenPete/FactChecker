pete
buttigieg
reflects
on
his
struggle
to
come
out
in
candid
debate
moment
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
pete
buttigieg
responded
to
a
question
about
professional
setbacks
during
thursday's
presidential
debate
by
offering
a
candid
reflection
about
struggling
with
his
own
sexuality
and
coming
out
as
gay
as
an
elected
official
in
indiana
you
know
as
a
military
officer
serving
under
don't
ask
don't
tell
and
as
an
elected
official
in
the
state
of
indiana
when
mike
pence
was
governor
at
a
certain
point
when
it
came
to
professional
setbacks
i
had
to
acknowledge
whether
just
being
who
i
was
was
going
to
be
the
ultimate
career
ending
professional
setback
buttigieg
said
during
the
debate
which
was
hosted
by
abc
news
i
came
back
from
the
deployment
and
realized
that
you
only
get
to
live
one
life
and
i
was
not
interested
in
not
knowing
what
it
was
like
to
be
in
love
any
longer
so
i
just
came
out
i
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
professional
setback
it
would
be
especially
because
inconveniently
it
was
a
reelection
year
in
my
socially
conservative
community
he
added
what
happened
was
when
i
trusted
voters
to
judge
me
based
on
the
job
that
i
did
for
them
they
decided
to
trust
me
and
reelect
me
with
of
the
vote
and
what
i
learned
was
trust
can
be
reciprocated
and
that
part
of
how
you
can
win
and
deserve
to
win
is
to
know
what's
worth
more
to
you
than
winning
buttigieg's
answer
marked
a
departure
from
a
debate
largely
defined
by
jabs
between
candidates
over
healthcare
and
foreign
policy
issues
while
being
gay
is
not
the
entirety
of
buttigieg's
story
or
his
campaign
it's
a
key
aspect
of
his
identity
and
voters
have
said
it
sets
him
apart
from
the
other
candidates
in
the
crowded
democratic
primary
buttigieg
closed
his
answer
by
declaring
that
the
election
is
not
about
the
candidates
on
stage
or
president
donald
trump
but
rather
the
people
that
trust
us
with
their
lives
we
have
to
know
what
we
are
about
and
this
election
is
not
about
any
of
us
up
here
it
is
not
about
this
president
even
though
it's
hard
to
talk
about
anything
else
some
days
it's
about
the
people
that
trust
us
with
their
lives
a
kid
wondering
if
we're
actually
going
to
make
their
school
safe
when
they've
learned
active
shooter
drills
before
they've
learned
to
read
a
generation
wondering
if
we
will
actually
get
the
job
done
on
climate
change
he
said
and
if
we
hold
to
that
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
each
of
us
professionally
together
we
will
win
a
better
era
for
our
country
