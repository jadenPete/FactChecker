a

ahead

to
zero
washington
cnn
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
has
frequently
relied
on
the
mantra
control
the
controllable
as
he
has
wrestled
with
president
donald
trump's
erratic
trade
policies
but
heading
into
this
week's
rate-setting
meeting
the
fed
is
facing
a
different
kind
of
threat
a
potential
oil
crisis
stemming
from
the
weekend's
attacks
on
saudi
facilities
the
fed
cut
rates
at
its
last
gathering
in
july
for
the
first
time
since
the
great
recession
and
is
widely
expected
to
cut
again
this
week
but
given
rising
global
turmoil
the
question
almost
immediately
will
be
whether
it
will
keep
going
as
the
year
wears
on
to
satisfy
powell's
promise
to
keep
the
us
economy
humming
one
of
the
biggest
factors
playing
into
our
current
economic
outlook
is
uncertainty
along
with
a
heightened
level
of
this
higher
oil
prices
may
be
just
one
more
nail
in
the
coffin
for
this
current
us
expansion
beth
ann
bovino
us
chief
economist
at
s
p
global
ratings
wrote
in
a
research
note
on
monday
as
it
is
we
are
already
seeing
businesses
being
reluctant
to
invest
given
the
trade
headwinds
and
this
gives
them
more
reason
to
hold
off
powell
backed
a
rate
increase
last
december
and
had
initially
indicated
he
planned
to
continue
tightening
this
year
in
the
face
of
a
thriving
labor
market
and
strong
consumer
demand
but
that
plan
reversed
as
trump's
trade
wars
took
a
toll
on
the
global
economy
and
powell
has
signaled
he's
open
to
continuing
to
support
the
economy
we're
going
to
continue
to
act
as
appropriate
to
sustain
this
expansion
powell
said
on
sept
during
a
question-and-answer
session
in
zurich
the
global
economy
is
starting
to
show
signs
of
strains
as
a
result
of
the
on-again
off-again
trade
war
between
the
world's
two
largest
economic
superpowers
the
united
states
and
china
several
major
countries
have
reported
weak
growth
with
germany's
economy
contracting
slightly
china's
economy
continues
to
worsen
as
industrial
production
has
weakened
and
retail
has
softened
resolution
of
the
long-standing
trade
war
has
been
elusive
as
officials
on
both
sides
have
swung
quickly
from
ratcheting
tariffs
higher
to
softening
billions
of
dollars
in
economic
penalties
on
goods
sending
financial
markets
spinning
the
united
states
and
china
are
expected
to
hold
high-level
negotiations
in
october
but
no
deal
is
guaranteed
and
president
donald
trump
has
promised
to
impose
additional
tariffs
by
the
end
of
the
year
unless
the
two
sides
reach
an
agreement
now
the
multiple
drone
attack
on
saudi
arabia
which
has
significantly
cut
its
crude
output
and
rattled
oil
markets
could
also
complicate
matters
for
the
fed
the
attacks
present
yet
another
headwind
for
the
global
economy
that
is
already
buffeted
by
deteriorating
manufacturing
activity
and
elevated
trade
tensions
wrote
mark
haefele
global
chief
investment
officer
for
ubs
in
a
note
to
clients
he
said
however
that
the
short-term
disruption
to
oil
production
was
unlikely
to
trigger
a
global
recession
in
recent
months
powell
has
said
the
us
economy
continues
to
remain
in
a
favorable
place
with
moderate
growth
expected
along
with
a
strong
labor
market
and
inflation
inching
closer
to
the
fed's
target
the
level
it
considers
healthy
for
the
us
economy
but
he
has
also
warned
of
significant
risks
facing
the
us
economy
including
slowing
global
growth
and
trade
uncertainty
and
has
made
explicit
that
there
are
no
recent
precedents
to
guide
how
policymakers
should
account
for
such
trade
policy
uncertainty
powell
has
all
but
promised
that
the
fed
would
commit
to
lowering
the
federal
funds
rates
which
affects
the
costs
of
mortgages
credit
cards
and
other
borrowing
to
a
range
between
and
the
challenge
facing
fed
officials
is
there
are
still
signs
the
us
economy
is
on
solid
ground
despite
signals
that
consumer
confidence
has
gotten
shakier
and
business
investment
has
waned
along
with
a
weakness
in
manufacturing
the
mixed
economic
picture
has
left
fed
officials
divided
over
whether
the
economy
needs
more
support
at
this
time
to
continue
the
expansion
or
whether
it
risks
overheating
the
economy
and
causing
inflation
two
members
of
the
fed's
policy-setting
committee
boston
fed
president
eric
rosengren
and
kansas
city
president
esther
george
voted
against
the
decision
to
cut
rates
in
july
investors
will
be
looking
for
clues
on
what
happens
later
this
year
and
whether
the
fed
may
continue
to
ease
amid
a
cloudy
outlook
and
sustained
economic
uncertainty
the
key
for
powell
will
be
to
underscore
the
ongoing
strength
of
the
economy
and
the
desire
by
the
committee
to
hold
their
ammunition
which
is
limited
until
they
see
worse
economic
data
on
the
economy
and
or
a
significant
tightening
of
credit
conditions
said
diane
swonk
chief

in
a
note
they
do
not
want
to
repeat
the
mistakes
of
last

when
they
looked
asleep
at
the
wheel
