news
of
the

comes
amid
renewed
scrutiny
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
to
the
supreme
court
last
year
as
a
new
book
is
published
that
contains
a
previously
unreported
sexual
misconduct
allegation
against
kavanaugh
while
a
student
at
yale
the
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
by
the
book's
authors
and
her
friend
told
the
authors
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
kavanaugh's
nomination
to
the
supreme
court
was
nearly
derailed
by
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
christine
blasey
ford
a
california
professor
and
the
first
accuser
to
come
forward
testified
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
kavanaugh
had
sexually
assaulted
her
at
a
party
when
they
were
both
teenagers
he
has
denied
all
allegations
against
him
while
president
donald
trump
has
stood
by
kavanaugh
as
he
did
throughout
his
nominee's
confirmation
process
some
democrats
including
presidential
candidates
are
jumping
on
the
wave
of
renewed
scrutiny
to
call
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
i
sat
through
those
hearings
brett
kavanaugh
lied
to
the
us
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
said
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
a
member
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
