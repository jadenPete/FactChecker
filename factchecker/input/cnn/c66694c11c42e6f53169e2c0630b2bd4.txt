justice
department
rejects
andrew
mccabe's
appeal
to
avoid
prosecution
washington
cnn
the
justice
department
has
rejected
an
appeal
from
former
fbi
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
of
a
recommendation
to
indict
him
made
by
the
us
attorney
in
washington
dc
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
say
the
us
attorney
has
been
scrutinizing
alleged
false
statements
mccabe
made
to
investigators
regarding
his
involvement
in
a
newspaper
report
about
an
investigation
into
the
clinton
foundation
published
days
before
the
presidential
election
the
us
attorney
jessie
liu
recommended
that
mccabe
should
be
indicted
and
in
a
meeting
with
deputy
attorney
general
jeffrey
rosen
at
the
justice
department
last
month
mccabe's
attorneys
argued
against
that
recommendation
one
of
the
sources
said
on
thursday
a
senior
doj
official
sent
mccabe's
legal
team
an
email
saying
that
that
appeal
had
been
rejected
according
to
a
second
person
who
is
close
to
the
legal
team
mccabe
has
said
he
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
his
attorneys
say
that
any
charges
against
him
would
be
driven
by
politics
and
retaliation
from
president
donald
trump
for
the
fbi's
scrutiny
of
his
administration
mccabe
is
a
cnn
contributor
mccabe
who
became
the
fbi's
acting
director
after
james
comey
was
fired
was
faulted
by
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
in
a
report
last
year
for
lacking
candor
when
he
discussed
with
investigators
his
decision
to
direct
fbi
officials
to
disclose
the
information
about
the
clinton
foundation
probe
to
the
wall
street
journal
the
notification
to
mccabe
that
his
appeal
was
rejected
is
a
strong
indication
that
an
indictment
may
be
imminent
if
mccabe
were
to
be
indicted
it
would
represent
a
rare
step
against
a
senior
law
enforcement
official
and
the
first
set
of
charges
against
an
official
involved
in
the
investigations
into
trump
as
the
president
has
waged
a
crusade
to
discredit
them
mccabe
has
disputed
the
findings
of
the
inspector
general
and
his
attorneys
have
argued
that
mccabe
made
inaccurate
statements
only
after
investigators
sprang
questions
on
him
in
a
confusing
way
mccabe
later
corrected
his
statements
to
investigators
about
authorizing
the
disclosure
to
the
newspaper
a
spokeswoman
for
the
dc
us
attorney
declined
to
comment
after
comey
was
fired
in
may
mccabe
opened
the
fbi's
obstruction
of
justice
investigation
into
the
president
before
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
was
appointed
in
march
two
days
shy
of
his
scheduled
retirement
date
when
he
would
have
become
eligible
to
receive
early
retirement
benefits
mccabe
was
fired
from
the
fbi
mccabe
has
sued
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
over
his
firing
accusing
trump
of
retaliating
against
him
the
justice
department's
track
record
of
bringing
charges
in
false
statements
cases
appears
to
be
mixed
mueller
charged
multiple
people
in
and
for
making
false
statements
to
the
fbi
including
trump's
first
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
but
the
justice
department
on
several
occasions
in
recent
years
has
declined
to
prosecute
individuals
faulted
by
the
inspector
general's
office
for
making
false
statements
or
lacking
candor
in
interviews
