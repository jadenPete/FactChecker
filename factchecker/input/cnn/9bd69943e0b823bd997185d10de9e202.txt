the

party
is
a
cult
washington
cnn
former
illinois
rep
joe
walsh
said
monday
his
campaign
will
go
straight
to
republican
voters
in
states
where
republican
parties
canceled
presidential
primaries
saying
the
party
has
become
a
cult
that
is
all
about
washing
their
leaders
feet
every
day
walsh
along
with
republican
primary
challengers
former
south

massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
criticized
gop
leaders
and
president
donald
trump
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
on
friday
on
the
heels
of
party
leaders
in
kansas
south
carolina
and
nevada
canceling
their

in
a
show
of

how
he
plans
to
challenge
it
walsh
said
he
is
going
to
take
his
campaign
straight
to
voters
we're
going
to
take
our
campaign
directly
to
republican
voters
and
i'll
add
in
all
states
we're
going
to
campaign
in
all
states
walsh
said
we're
going
to
campaign
in
south
carolina
arizona
nevada
and
kansas
because
i
believe
if
we
let
these
republican
voters
know
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
just
took
away
their
right
to
vote
they'll
march
on
the
headquarters
of
their
state
parties
to
get
that
right
to
vote
back
gop
trump
challengers
slam
canceled
primaries
only
the
weak
fear
competition
walsh
who
voted
for
trump
in
the
presidential
election
and
is
now
outspoken
against
the
trump
presidency
called
trump
a
would-be
dictator
i
always
want
to
pinch
myself
and
remind
myself
that
this
isn't
russia
i
do
not
live
in
russia
i
refuse
to
live
in
russia
walsh
said
we
can't
just
cancel
elections
in
this
country
that's
what
donald
trump
is
doing
he's
literally
canceling
elections
and
it's
very
easy
to
be
p
off
at
trump
but
we're
used
to
this
with
trump
he
is
a
would-be
dictator
he
would
like
this
to
be
russia
walsh
also
said
on
monday
he
has
given
up
on
the
republican
party
calling
it
a
cult
they
no
longer
stand
for
ideas
the
republican

what
they
do
