says
he
won't
take
a
deal
if
he's
indicted
cnn
andrew
mccabe
the
former
acting
fbi
director
who's
been
told
he
may
be
indicted
told
cnn
on
tuesday
that
he
would
never
cut
a
deal
with
federal
prosecutors
to
avoid
an
indictment
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
chris
cuomo
on
cuomo
prime
time
mccabe
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
taking
a
deal
which
could
be
a
way
to
reduce
any
possible
charges
he'd
face
or
lead
to
a
guilty
plea
that
would
avoid
a
trial
mccabe's
assertion
tuesday
night
means
that
if
he's
indicted
he
will
almost
certainly
contest
the
charge
before
a
jury
in
federal
court
absolutely
not
under
any
circumstances
mccabe
said
i
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
about
anything
and
i
will
not
stand
up
and
claim
that
i've
done
something
that
i
didn't
do
mccabe
is
a
cnn
contributor
mccabe
has
found
himself
a
target
of
investigators
and
republicans
including
president
donald
trump
since
when
he
authorized
a
leak
to
a
then-wall
street
journal
reporter
about
a
conversation
he
had
endorsing
the
investigation
of
the
clinton
foundation
the
justice
department's
independent
inspector
general
who
looked
into
the
incident
found
mccabe
had
lacked
candor
on
four
occasions
when
he
spoke
to
investigators
about
the
leak
the
inspector
general
then
referred
the
matter
to
the
fbi
i
absolutely
reject
the
findings
of
the
inspector
general
mccabe
added
in
his
roughly
minute
interview
with
cuomo
he
added
i
certainly
have
not
committed
a
crime
mccabe
declined
to
answer
cuomo
when
asked
why
he
had
given
investigators
the
wrong
answer
in
and
which
the
inspector
general
found
to
be
misconduct
worthy
of
further
federal
investigation
he
cited
the
pending
investigation
as
a
reason
not
to
speak
more
in
detail
last
week
speculation
over
whether
he
would
be
indicted
for
his
comments
during
interviews
with
investigators
rose
to
a
fever
pitch
the
us
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
jessie
liu
had
recommended
he
be
indicted
in
recent
weeks
the
justice
department
told
mccabe's
attorneys
last
thursday
that
it
had
rejected
his
appeals
to
top
officials
to
avoid
the
charges
but
no
indictment
nor
any
other
update
from
the
justice
department
had
come
as
of
tuesday
night
according
to
a
spokesperson
for
his
legal
team
mccabe
told
cuomo
on
tuesday
that
he
has
heard
nothing
more
about
a
possible
indictment
since
that
flurry
of
activity
we
only
know
what
we
know
the
prosecutors
office
has
not
responded
to
us
with
any
significant
information
mccabe
said
mccabe
an
early
and
frequent
target
of
trump
because
of
his
role
as
a
leader
in
the
early
russia
investigation
and
his
wife's
activity
in
democratic
politics
has
said
that
he
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
and
later
corrected
his
statements
to
investigators
he
also
had
the
authority
at
that
time
to
disclose
the
information
to
the
reporter
an
indictment
of
the
former
acting
fbi
leader
would
be
an
unusual
prosecution
of
a
senior
law
enforcement
official
who's
become
a
political
foe
of
the
current
administration
separately
mccabe
has
sued
the
department
of
justice
and
fbi
for
firing
him
hours
before
reaching
his
official
retirement
date
he
claims
he
was
targeted
for
political
reasons
especially
by
trump
himself
and
lost
his
job
a
pension
and
other
retirement
benefits
he
had
earned
the
lawsuit
in
federal
court
in
washington
is
still
in
its
earliest
stage
