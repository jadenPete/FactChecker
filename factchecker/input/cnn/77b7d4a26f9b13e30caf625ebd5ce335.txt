corey
lewandowski
is
trolling
to
please
donald
trump
cnn
within
the
first
five
minutes
of
corey
lewandowski's
testimony
in
front
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
tuesday
it
became
crystal
clear
what
donald
trump's
former
campaign
manager
was
up
to
trolling
to
please
his
old
boss
lewandowski's
opening
statement
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
greatest
hits
recital
of
trump's
tweets
on
the
subject
of
russia's
attempt
to
influence
the
presidential
election
whether
it
was
bad
actors
at
the
fbi
or
lies
coming
from
members
of
the
current
house
majority
that
there
was
evidence
of
collusion
the
american
people
continue
to
be
sold
a
false
narrative
with
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
legitimacy
of
the
election
lewandowski
said
he
called
the
trump
campaign
a
historical
and
unprecedented
political
juggernaut
he
denounced
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
probe
as
an
investigation
populated
by
many
trump
haters
to
take
down
a
duly
elected
president
but
lewandowski
was
just
getting
started
in
the
early
going
he
refused
to
answer
literally
any
question
from
the
democratic
side
of
the
dais
up
to
and
including
rejecting
texas
democratic
rep
sheila
jackson
lee's
request
he
read
something
from
a
screen
he
also
stalled
repeatedly
by
asking
for
citations
within
the
mueller
report
for
even
basic
facts
like
if
he
had
met
with
trump
on
a
certain
day
and
then
reading
the
letter
sent
by
the
white
house
on
monday
asking
him
not
to
discuss
any
conversations
he
had
with
the
president
lewandowski's
tactics
clearly
frustrated
democrats
although
it's
not
immediately
clear
to
me
why
given
that
lewandowski
has
always
been
the
single
most
loyal
soldier
in
the
trump
political
army
and
he
had
zero
incentive
to
cooperate
with
any
question
from
democrats
given
a
he
knew
trump
was
watching
very
closely
and
b
lewandowski
is
currently
considering
a
run
for
the
senate
in
new
hampshire
and
badly
needs
and
wants
that
strong
support
from
the
president
and
the
president
was
indeed
watching
such
a
beautiful
opening
statement
by
corey
lewandowski
trump
tweeted
tuesday
afternoon
thank
you
corey
the
result
of
all
of
it
was
a
made-for-tv
circus
exasperated
democratic
members
repeatedly
tried
to
get
lewandowski
to
answer
even
the
most
basic
questions
about
the
nature
of
his
relationship
with
trump
let
me
remind
you
mr
lewandowski
that
this
is
not
a
republican
primary
campaign
you
are
not
on
the
campaign
trail
yet
democratic
new
york
rep
hakeem
jeffries
said
at
one
point
during
the
testimony
defiant
republicans
led
by
ranking
member
doug
collins
in
an
audition
of
his
own
for
the
state's
vacant
senate
seat
questioned
why
lewandowski
had
even
been
asked
to
testify
publicly
given
that
he
had
already
spent
hours
talking
to
the
house
and
senate
intelligence
committees
as
well
as
to
mueller
and
in
the
middle
of
it
was
lewandowski
trolling
as
hard
as
he
possibly
could
at
every
turn
sure
in
the
knowledge
that
he
could
never
be
too
combative
too
disruptive
too
anything
other
than
forthcoming
of
course
for
the
only
audience
that
mattered
donald
trump
see
lewandowski
understood
that
this
hearing
wasn't
really
a
testimony
it
was
a
tryout
ever
since
being
fired
as
campaign
manager
in
the
spring
of
largely
at
the
behest
of
trump's
adult
children
lewandowski
has
been
working
his
way
back
into
the
president's
good
graces
and
inner
circle
he
has
done
so
through
total
fealty
to
the
president
and
total
rejection
of
the
idea
that
either
he
or
anyone
else
in
the
campaign
especially
trump
did
anything
wrong
during
the
course
of
the
race
while
democrats
saw
today's
hearing
as
a
first
step
in
their
impeachment
inquiry
lewandowski
viewed
it
as
the
ultimate
platform
to
prove
once
again
just
how
loyal
he
is
to
trump
the
ultimate
goal
presumably
an
endorsement
from
the
president
for
lewandowski's
senate
campaign
lewandowski's
twitter
handle
tweeted
out
a
link
to
a
new
website
for
his
potential
senate
run
in
the
middle
of
his
congressional
testimony
if
for
whatever
reason
lewandowski
doesn't
make
the
senate
race
or
his
campaign
fizzles
he
was
also
using
his
platform
on
tuesday
to
make
the
case
to
join
either
the
white
house
or
more
likely
the
campaign
for
trump
it
was
the
ultimate
audience
of
one
moment
lewandowski
trolling
his
heart
out
to
secure
his
political
future
by
making
trump
happy
and
trump
nodding
approvingly
from
the
sidelines
of
the
lewandowski
tryout
this
is
how
american
politics
looks
in
and
it's
not
pretty
