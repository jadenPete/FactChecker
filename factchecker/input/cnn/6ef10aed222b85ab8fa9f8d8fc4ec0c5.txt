cost
about
billion
committee
says
top
democrats
we
hope
trump
learned
his
lesson
washington

a
new
bipartisan
investigation
into
the
consequences
of
the
last
three
government
shutdowns
reveals
that
the
cost
of
political
intransigence
was
roughly
billion
to
us
taxpayers
the
number
comes
from
the
senate
homeland
security
and
government
affairs
permanent
subcommittee
on
investigations
which
worked
for
months
to
compile
a
full
accounting
of
just
how
much
time
money
and
effort
was
wasted
when
the
federal
government
shut
down
in
recent
years
of
the
billion
price
tag
nearly
billion
of
it
went
to
paying
workers
who
were
forced
to
stay
home
during
the
shutdown
the
other
million
came
from
costs
associated
with
the
shutdown
like
administrative
work
lost
revenue
and
late
fees
on
interest
payments
the
report
states
by
combining
the
number
of
days
federal
employees
were
out
of
work
the
report
estimated
the
shutdowns
cost
federal
agencies
years
of
lost
productivity
the
congressional
budget
office
also
found
that
the
shutdowns
not
only
cost
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
but
reduced
overall
economic
growth
the
cbo
estimated
that
the
most
recent
shutdown
reduced
economic
growth
by
a
combined
billion
in
the
last
three
months
of
and
first
three
months
of
government
shutdowns
are
avoidable
failures
of
governance
that
hemorrhage
taxpayer
dollars
put
our
nation's
federal
agencies
in
organizational
and
financial
disarray
and
pose
risks
to
our
national
security
sen
tom
carper
of
delaware
the
top
democrat
on
the
subcommittee
on
investigations
said
in
a
statement
congress
returns
to
a
gun
debate
and
fight
over
funding
the
government
the
report
totals
the
costs
of
the
past
three
government
shutdowns
including
the
longest
government
shutdown
in
american
history
that
began
during
the
christmas
holiday
of
and
lasted
for
days
it
also
includes
information
about
the
brief
shutdown
in
january
and
the
day
shutdown
in
during
the
obama
administration
the
investigators
also
suggest
they
weren't
able
to
get
all
the
information
they
wanted
the
report's
authors
noted
that
the
department
of
defense
agriculture
justice
commerce
and
the
environmental
protection
agency
did
not
hand
over
some
basic
information
about
the
shutdown's
costs
and
if
they
had
the
report's
authors
note
the
billion
total
would
have
been
much
higher
this
raises
serious
questions
about
these
agencies
ability
to
perform
any
oversight
of
its
own
employees
the
report
states
the
report
also
notes
important
functions
that
were
stopped
during
the
shutdown
earlier
this
year
including
the
fda
halting
routine
food
and
food
manufacturing
facility
inspections
and
the
national
transportation
safety
board
pausing
their
investigations
into
six
major
and
fatal
aviation
accident
investigations
non-commercial
aviation
investigations
and
foreign
aviation
investigations
involving
us
operators
during
the
last
government
shutdown
the
department
of
justice
also
canceled
hearings
for
immigrants
likely
resulting
in
a
further
backlog
in
immigration
court
cases
the
system
is
still
experiencing
today
the
report
accounted
for
how
the
shutdowns
affected
nearly
every
major
department
in
the
government
from
the
department
of
state
to
the
us
consumer
product
safety
commission
which
the
report
said
was
affected
because
port
inspectors
were
furloughed
the
report
said
workers
were
therefore
unable
to
screen
thousands
of
products
including
children's
merchandise
that
could
contain
excessive
lead
and
sleepwear
that
may
violate
flammability
standards
federal
government
shutdowns
don't
save
money
they
actually
cost
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
republican
sen
rob
portman
of
ohio
said
in
the
report's
release
it's
time
to
end
government
shutdowns
for
good
portman
has
introduced
legislation
to
provide
a
backstop
to
end
government
shutdowns
altogether
