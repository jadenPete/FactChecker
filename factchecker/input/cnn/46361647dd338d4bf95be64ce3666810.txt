tennessee
seeks
to
be
first
to
turn
medicaid
into
block
grant
program
the
debate
over
medicaid
explained
cnn
tennessee
released
a
plan
tuesday
to
radically
overhaul
its
medicaid
program
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
the
trump
administration's
push
to
give
states
more
flexibility
in
covering
low-income
residents
health
care
needs
under
tennessee's
proposal
the
state
would
become
the
first
in
the
nation
to
convert
medicaid
into
a
block
grant
program
this
would
give
it
more
control
over
administering
medicaid
in
exchange
for
taking
a
fixed
amount
of
federal
funding
block
grants
have
long
been
popular
with
republicans
who
see
them
as
a
way
to
control
medicaid
spending
they
were
part
of
congressional
republicans
failed
attempts
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
in
and
have
been
included
in
president
donald
trump's
budgets
and
the
trump
administration
which
would
need
to
approve
tennessee's
plan
has
encouraged
states
to
make
historic
changes
to
their
medicaid
programs
including
adding
work
requirements
cms
supports
efforts
to
improve
accountability
for
cost
and
outcomes
in
medicaid
and
we
look
forward
to
working
with
tennessee
once
they
submit
their
proposal
to
help
them
achieve
these
goals
as
effectively
as
possible
within
our
statutory
authority
said
johnathan
monroe
spokesman
for
the
centers
for
medicare
medicaid
services
opponents
however
say
block
grants
could
allow
states
to
curtail
medicaid
enrollments
and
benefits
leaving
low-income
residents
vulnerable
consumer
groups
have
sued
the
trump
administration
over
its
approval
of
work
requirements
halting
them
in
three
states
and
would
likely
do
the
same
if
officials
approved
tennessee's
block
grant
plan
medicaid
covers
more
than
million
americans
particularly
low-income
children
pregnant
women
the
elderly
and
people
with
disabilities
and
is
a
major
source
of
coverage
for
long-term
care
and
births
under
the
affordable
care
act
it
was
expanded
to
cover
low-income
adults
in
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
funding
is
now
open-ended
with
the
federal
government
paying
more
than
of
total
medicaid
costs
and
states
shouldering
about
of
the
bill
conservatives
complain
that
the
funding
formula
encourages
states
to
spend
more
so
they
can
secure
more
federal
funding
while
a
block
grant
would
prompt
them
to
better
control
costs
medicaid
is
typically
one
of
the
top
two
expenditures
for
states
and
governors
and
lawmakers
often
complain
that
it
eats
up
money
that
could
be
spent
on
education
infrastructure
and
other
needs
the
proposal
from
tennessee
which
has
not
expanded
medicaid
doesn't
follow
the
typical
block-grant
idea
which
would
offer
a
lump
sum
payment
to
a
state
it's
seeking
to
exclude
expenses
related
to
outpatient
prescription
drugs
home-
and
community-based
long-term
care
uncompensated
care
payments
to
hospitals
and
several
other
costs
these
would
continue
to
be
funded
under
the
current
formula
the
block
grant
funding
would
rise
if
enrollment
in
tennessee's
program
called
tenncare
increases
in
the
future
addressing
a
major
concern
that
the
safety
net
couldn't
expand
in
times
of
economic
downturns
plus
the
annual
increase
in
funding
would
be
based
on
congressional
budget
office
projections
for
medicaid
growth
which
is
more
generous
than
inflation
another
provision
if
the
state
spends
less
than
the
block
grant
amount
it
gets
to
keep
of
the
federal
share
of
those
savings
tennessee
has
drafted
a
proposal
that
gives
them
a
lot
of
safety
valves
but
still
asks
for
a
lot
of
flexibility
to
adjust
benefits
and
to
make
changes
without
going
through
cms
said
allison
orris
counsel
with
manatt
health
a
professional
services
firm
that
works
with
states
roughly
million
people
are
enrolled
in
tenncare
though
not
all
would
be
affected
by
the
block
grant
the
state's
initial
calculation
found
that
the
block
grant
would
be
billion
the
first
year
while
the
state's
proposal
says
there
will
be
no
reductions
in
who
is
eligible
or
what
benefits
are
provided
tennessee
is
asking
for
more
control
and
less
federal
oversight
among
the
flexibilities
it
wants
limiting
the
number
of
prescription
drugs
covered
changing
the
optional
benefits
such
as
prescription
drugs
and
physical
therapy
it
provides
without
federal
approval
modifying
the
enrollment
process
and
allowing
spending
on
social
programs
that
affect
participants
health
such
as
nutrition
assistance
and
housing
support
the
tennessee
legislature
passed
a
law
in
may
directing
the
governor
to
seek
a
block
grant
waiver
within
six
months
other
states
are
also
looking
to
change
how
their
medicaid
programs
are
funded
alaska
has
commissioned
a
study
of
block
grants
while
utah
has
asked
federal
officials
to
allow
it
to
place
a
per
capita
cap
on
medicaid
spending
