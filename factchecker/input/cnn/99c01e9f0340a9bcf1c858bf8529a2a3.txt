congress
weighs
response
to
attacks
on
saudi
oil
facilities
cnn
a
few
days
after
the
abqaiq
and
the
khurais
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
were
attacked
members
of
congress
sought
information
about
the
culprit
and
debated
whether
us
military
action
would
be
necessary
vice
president
mike
pence
told
a
group
of
republican
senators
at
lunch
tuesday
in
the
capitol
that
the
us
goal
is
to
restore
deterrence
after
the
attacks
which
caused
oil
prices
to
fluctuate
but
he
did
not
suggest
any
specific
retaliatory
measures
according
to
sen
lindsey
graham
he
said
that
the
goal
was
to
restore
deterrence
and
he
left
it
at
that
said
the
south
carolina
republican
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
told
reporters
that
the
trump
administration
can't
say
definitively
that
iran
was
behind
the
attacks
but
that
in
all
likelihood
it
was
iran
has
denied
responsibility
for
saturday's
attack
saudi
and
us
investigators
have
determined
with
very
high
probability
that
the
weekend
attack
was
launched
from
a
base
in
iran
close
to
the
border
with
iraq
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
investigation
members
of
congress
pointed
the
finger
there
too
even
though
yemen's
houthi
rebels
have
claimed
responsibility
while
others
called
for
more
information
brian
hook
us
special
representative
for
iran
and
a
senior
policy
adviser
to
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
held
a
call
with
capitol
hill
staffers
on
monday
to
discuss
the
attacks
according
to
four
sources
familiar
with
the
call
during
that
conversation
hook
said
the
attack
was
definitely
not
carried
out
by
the
houthi
rebels
but
wouldn't
say
who
did
conduct
it
when
pressed
a
source
familiar
with
the
call
told
cnn
sen
marco
rubio
a
florida
republican
told
reporters
tuesday
that
there's
no
doubt
that
the
iranians
were
behind
the
attacks
he
claimed
that
the
houthis
have
taken
responsibility
because
it
makes
them
look
more
capable
than
they
actually
are
other
republican
senators
agreed
that
iran
is
the
perpetrator
but
disagreed
over
how
to
define
the
us
response
graham
perhaps
the
senator
most
keen
on
a
military
response
pushed
for
attacking
iranian
oil
facilities
it's
got
to
be
a
blow
beyond
what
we're
doing
today
said
graham
and
i
think
it's
got
to
be
something
other
than
sanctions
so
to
me
what
would
restore
deterrence
is
for
them
to
pay
a
price
in
terms
of
their
capability
to
produce
oil
other
republicans
think
such
a
response
is
far
too
aggressive
sen
john
barrasso
a
wyoming
republican
said
on
cnn's
newsroom
that
the
us
should
continue
enforcing
its
sanctions
which
are
crippling
the
iranian
economy
they
are
biting
he
said
they
are
punishing
and
making
a
difference
sen
mitt
romney
a
utah
republican
told
cnn
that
if
there
is
a
response
it
should
come
from
the
saudis
i
do
not
believe
we
should
be
involved
with
kinetic
military
action
said
romney
i
believe
our
role
should
be
a
support
role
non-kinetic
saudi
arabia
is
fully
capable
of
defending
itself
romney
added
we've
been
providing
or
selling
them
the
weapons
they
need
to
do
so
it's
an
attack
on
their
homeland
not
ours
many
democrats
have
urged
restraint
while
we
don't
know
who
is
responsible
for
the
attacks
in
saudi
arabia
we
do
know
that
without
a
clear
strategy
to
deescalate
tensions
with
iran
the
situation
will
only
get
worse
rep
eliot
engel
a
new
york
democrat
who's
the
chairman
of
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
said
in
a
statement
as
the
administration
determines
next
steps
i'm
compelled
to
remind
them
that
the
constitution
is
clear
unless
the
united
states
is
attacked
first
the
president
needs
authorization
from
congress
before
attacking
iran
even
if
he
is
acting
in
support
of
one
of
our
partners
democrats
and
republicans
alike
have
pushed
for
more
information
regarding
the
attacks
sen
jim
risch
an
idaho
republican
who's
the
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
urged
members
to
go
to
the
capitol's
secure
facility
to
review
the
administration's
report
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
a
california
democrat
has
requested
a
briefing
for
all
house
members
on
the
bombing
and
iran
according
to
a
spokesperson
on
sunday
president
donald
trump
said
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
sen
bob
menendez
of
new
jersey
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
objected
to
that
message
tuesday
telling
reporters
that
trump's
words
were
irresponsible
the
president's
tweet
also
confused
him
what
does
that
mean
menendez
asked
