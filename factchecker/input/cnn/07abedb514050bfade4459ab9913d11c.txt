purchase
hear
ben
carson's
testy
exchanges
with
congress
cnn
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development's
internal
watchdog
cleared
secretary
ben
carson
of
wrongdoing
for
his
plan
to
purchase
a
dining
set
without
notifying
congress
the
department's
inspector
general
wrote
in
a
report
published
thursday
that
while
the
money
was
obligated
hud
did
not
ultimately
purchase
this
furniture
and
the
procurement
did
not
result
in
the
expenditure
of
any
departmental
funds
because
it
was
canceled
the
report
notes
that
carson
had
it
canceled
in
response
to
media
reports
the
decision
comes
after
hud
spokespeople
initially
denied
carson's
involvement
in
selecting
the
furniture
last
year
carson
then
requested
that
the
order
be
canceled
saying
in
a
statement
that
i
was
as
surprised
as
anyone
to
find
out
that
a
dining
set
had
been
ordered
the
set
comprised
a
table
sideboard
and
breakfront
all
in
mahogany
as
well
as
mahogany
chairs
with
a
blue
velvet
finish
costing
well
beyond
the
legal
limit
to
renovate
carson's
office
it
was
intended
for
the
secretary's
dining
room
at
department
headquarters
to
replace
a
set
that
was
in
a
state
of
disrepair
a
department
official
said
last
year
cnn
then
reported
last
march
that
carson
and
his
wife
had
selected
the
dining
set
citing
emails
between
staffers
in
which
carson's
assistant
refers
to
printouts
of
the
furniture
the
secretary
and
mrs
carson
picked
out
when
pressed
on
the
decision
during
a
house
subcommittee
hearing
later
that
month
carson
said
i
left
it
with
my
wife
candy
who
selected
a
style
and
a
color
of
the
furniture
set
we
did
not
find
sufficient
evidence
to
substantiate
allegations
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
secretary
carson
in
connection
with
this
procurement
the
report
released
on
thursday
stated
we
found
no
evidence
indicating
that
either
secretary
or
mrs
carson
exerted
improper
influence
on
any
departmental
employee
in
connection
with
the
procurement
the
report
added
in
a
statement
a
spokesperson
for
the
office
of
inspector
general
told
cnn
that
we
believe
the
findings
of
the
report
released
today
speaks
for
itself
the
spokesperson
emphasized
for
the
sake
of
clarity
that
the
inspector
general's
office
is
not
making
any
recommendations
to
the
department
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
gathered
in
this
investigation
because
we
found
no
evidence
of
misconduct
and
because
the
department
is
working
to
address
the
legal
ramifications
of
the
dining-room-furniture
procurement
and
to
prevent
future
appropriations-law
violations
