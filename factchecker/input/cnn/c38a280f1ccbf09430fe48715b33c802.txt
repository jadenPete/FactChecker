fact
check
trump
makes
at
least
false
claims
at
new
mexico
rally
cnn
president
donald
trump
spoke
for
minutes
at
a
campaign
rally
in
new
mexico
on
monday
night
among
the
longest
speeches
he's
given
as
president
we're
still
working
through
the
long
transcript
but
we
know
he
made
at
least
false
claims
most
of
them
ones
he's
said
before
in
recent
months
here's
the
list
so
far
trump
repeated
his
claim
that
a
google
executive
someone
who
worked
at
google
reported
that
google
bias
may
have
cost
trump
up
to
million
votes
in
the
election
that
flawed
study
which
we
fact-checked
last
month
was
conducted
by
a
psychologist
not
a
google
employee
or
executive
trump
said
venezuela
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
countries
in
the
world
years
ago
when
it
wasn't
venezuela
was
th
in
the
world
in
gdp
per
capita
in
he
boasted
that
he
was
the
one
who
got
the
veterans
choice
health
care
program
passed
saying
they've
tried
to
get
that
for
years
they
haven't
been
able
to
get
it
but
i'm
good
at
getting
things
the
program
was
created
in
in
a
bill
signed
by
president
barack
obama
he
said
of
his
usmca
trade
agreement
unions
love
it
the
agreement
is
generally
opposed
in
its
current
form
by
major
us
unions
who
have
demanded
changes
to
the
text
the
president
of
the
afl-cio
federation
says
it
will
be
a
disaster
for
workers
if
it
is
not
amended
he
said
they
wanted
a
wall
in
san
diego
good
mayor
in
san
diego
by
the
way
they
wanted
a
wall
there
is
no
apparent
basis
for
this
repeated
claim
even
that
mayor
republican
kevin
faulconer
opposes
the
wall
he
said
the
democrats
have
an
agenda
of
open
borders
even
democratic
presidential
candidates
who
advocate
the
decriminalization
of
the
act
of
illegally
entering
the
country
such
as
senator
elizabeth
warren
and
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
do
not
support
completely
unrestricted
migration
as
trump
suggests
trump
said
we
will
always
protect
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
the
republicans
will
always
do
that
this
promise
has
already
proven
false
trump
and
republicans
who
have
tried
to
pass
bills
that
would
have
weakened
protections
for
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
are
now
trying
to
get
the
courts
to
declare
obamacare
void
without
a
plan
to
replace
those
pre-existing
protections
if
their
lawsuit
succeeds
he
said
we
eliminated
the
unfair
estate
tax
or
death
tax
his
tax
law
raised
the
threshold
for
the
tax
so
that
fewer
people
now
have
to
pay
it
but
did
not
eliminate
it
entirely
he
said
north
carolina
congressional
candidate
dan
bishop
who
won
a
special
election
last
week
was
down
points
before
trump
got
involved
there
is
no
apparent
basis
for
this
number
some
polls
did
have
bishop
down
but
in
the
single
digits
he
said
another
successful
north
carolina
republican
candidate
greg
murphy
had
been
up
only
a
couple
points
before
his
special
election
murphy
was
running
in
a
district
trump
won
by
in
polls
had
put
him
up
by
double-digits
he
said
the
mueller
investigation
cost
million
the
final
total
was
million
and
the
government
is
expected
to
recoup
about
million
from
former
trump
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
as
a
result
of
mueller's
convictions
he
said
china
is
eating
the
tariffs
he
has
imposed
on
imports
of
chinese
products
a
bevy
of
economic
studies
has
found
that
americans
are
bearing
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
tariff
costs
and
americans
make
the
actual
tariff
payments
he
said
china
is
having
its
worst
economic
year
in
years
china's
second-quarter
growth
rate
was
the
worst
in
years
trump
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
he
knows
that
this
is
the
reported
figure
but
he
has
added
additional
years
for
no
apparent
reason
he
said
the
us
has
never
previously
received
cents
from
china
only
unemployment
job
losses
and
pencils
the
us
generated
billions
per
year
in
revenue
from
tariffs
on
china
again
paid
by
americans
before
trump
took
office
the
us
imported
billion
from
china
in
the
top
categories
were
electrical
machinery
billion
machinery
billion
furniture
and
bedding
billion
toys
and
sports
equipment
billion
and
plastics
billion
according
to
the
us
government's
trade
website
he
said
his
border
wall
is
being
built
fast
as
of
the
end
of
august
zero
additional
miles
had
been
built
during
trump's
presidency
miles
of
replacement
barriers
had
been
built
trump
has
argued
that
these
replacement
projects
should
count
as
his
wall
he
said
human
trafficking
victims
do
not
come
through
legal
ports
of
entry
only
through
the
desert
areas
and
open
parts
of
the
border
experts
on
us
trafficking
say
a
large
percentage
of
victims
come
through
legal
ports
according
to
the
international
organization
for
migration
in
the
last
ten
years
almost
of
journeys
undertaken
by
victims
trafficked
internationally
cross
through
official
border
points
such
as
airports
and
land
border
control
points
speaking
about
energy
trump
said
we're
independent
and
we
are
now
a
net
exporter
of
energy
the
us
government
energy
information
administration
predicts
the
us
will
become
a
net
exporter
of
energy
next
year
but
it
hasn't
happened
yet
he
said
he
had
ended
the
obama
administration's
war
on
american
energy
and
that
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
anywhere
in
the
world
the
us
became
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
gas
under
obama
in
it
is
crude
oil
in
particular
in
which
it
became
number
one
under
trump
he
said
asian
american
unemployment
numbers
are
the
best
in
history
the
unemployment
rate
for
asian
americans
did
briefly
fall
to
a
record
low
under
trump
but
it
is
now
slightly
higher
than
it
was
in
obama's
last
month
in
office
he
said
the
unemployment
numbers
for
women
are
the
best
in
years
this
was
his
usual
slight
exaggeration
the
rate
this
summer
has
been
the
lowest
since
years
ago
he
called
unfavorable
polls
suppression
polls
designed
to
deflate
his
supporters
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
this
claim
he
said
the
us
has
the
cleanest
air
that
we've
ever
had
in
this
country
by
several
measures
us
air
was
cleaner
under
obama
than
it's
been
under
trump
three
of
the
six
types
of
pollutants
identified
by
the
clean
air
act
as
toxic
to
human
health
were
more
prevalent
in
the
air
as
of
than
they
were
before
trump
took
office
according
to
environmental
protection
agency
data
additionally
there
were
more
unhealthy
air
days
for
sensitive
groups
in
than
in
trump
said
obama
left
him
judicial
vacancies
to
fill
according
to
russell
wheeler
a
visiting
fellow
at
the
brookings
institution
who
tracks
judicial
appointments
there
were
vacancies
on
district
and
appeals
courts
on
january
just
before
trump
took
office
plus
one
vacancy
on
the
supreme
court
republican
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
blocked
the
confirmation
of
many
of
obama's
judicial
nominees
late
in
his
term
he
said
that
before
the
election
cubans
in
miami
gave
me
the
bay
of
pigs
award
can
you
imagine
right
the
bay
of
pigs
award
trump
got
an
endorsement
from
the
bay
of
pigs
veterans
association
not
an
award
the
endorsement
was
unprecedented
from
the
association
so
trump
could
fairly
boast
about
it
but
still
an
award
and
an
endorsement
are
different
things
trump
claimed
in
august
to
have
received
an
award
from
the
log
cabin
republicans
which
told
cnn
it
gave
him
an
endorsement
but
not
an
award
he
suggested
appearing
to
be
joking
at
least
in
part
that
the
democrats
green
new
deal
proposal
would
require
people
to
have
no
more
than
a
single
car
and
would
prohibit
people
from
driving
more
than
miles
the
green
new
deal
resolution
does
not
include
any
restrictions
on
the
number
of
cars
people
can
own
or
how
far
they
can
drive
he
said
he
calls
the
democratic
party
the
democrat
party
not
only
because
democrat
sounds
worse
than
democratic
but
because
that's
their
name
the
democrat
party
he
advised
the
party
to
change
its
name
to
the
democratic
party
since
he
would
then
call
them
that
the
party
is
already
named
the
democratic
party
we
realize
this
is
a
strange-sounding
fact
check
but
trump
has
repeatedly
insisted
that
the
actual
name
is
the
democrat
party
he
said
he
saw
the
other
day
that
the
democrats
just
gave
out
a
tremendous
contract
for
their
convention
site
in
milwaukee
you
know
what
it's
for
they're
building
a
big
wall
around
the
building
they're
building
a
big
wall
a
massive
wall
no
such
contract
has
been
awarded
it's
not
true
said
democratic
national
committee
spokesman
brandon
gassaway
while
there
will
likely
be
some
sort
of
security
fencing
around
the
convention
there
are
no
known
plans
for
a
giant
wall
