joe
biden
has
his
best
debate
night
and
that
might
be
good
enough
juli
n
castro
takes
jab
at
joe
biden's
memory
cnn
joe
biden
was
as
good
at
thursday
night's
debate
as
he's
been
in
the
entire
campaign
and
perhaps
close
to
as
good
as
he
could
be
in
some
scenarios
of
how
the
election
breaks
such
a
solid
but
unspectacular
showing
could
be
enough
for
the
former
vice
president
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
and
maybe
even
the
white
house
after
a
summer
marked
by
occasional
gaffes
suggested
he
might
be
a
decade
past
his
best
biden
personified
one
of
his
most
winning
characteristics
resilience
in
steadying
his
front-running
campaign
his
performance
in
houston
is
likely
to
quell
fears
that
his
third
presidential
bid
could
stall
at
any
minute
like
his
previous
campaigns
and
leave
questions
about
his
deepest
liabilities
for
another
day
it
keeps
his
core
claim
intact
that
he
is
the
most
electable
democrat
in
a
fierce
race
with
president
donald
trump
it
helped
that
one
of
his
rivals
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
defused
the
age
question
with
a
crude
suggestion
that
biden
had
memory
problems
that
even
appeared
to
make
other
candidates
on
stage
blanch
and
since
the
night
lacked
a
standout
showing
by
sen
elizabeth
warren
who
has
been
rising
in
the
polls
and
media
buzz
or
anyone
else
on
stage
the
debate
may
therefore
freeze
the
race
in
place
with
biden
as
a
clear
but
not
prohibitive
front-runner
after
appearing
off
his
game
in
previous
debates
biden
was
sharper
traded
jabs
more
easily
with
other
candidates
and
was
stronger
on
policy
his
own
and
the
weaknesses
in
the
platforms
of
his
foes
for
the
nomination
than
ever
before
he
made
his
strongest
tilt
yet
at
animating
a
center
left
argument
for
democrats
one
that
puts
him
at
odds
with
the
noisiest
and
most
progressive
elements
of
his
party
and
he
began
to
tease
out
the
ideological
debate
with
warren
and
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
that
could
define
this
race
his
message
was
that
big
aspirations
on
issues
like
health
care
are
great
but
ultimately
mean
nothing
without
a
plan
to
get
them
enacted
in
what
is
likely
to
be
an
unresponsive
congress
biden
shows
his
liabilities
as
well
but
biden
was
far
from
perfect
in
one
almost
impossible-to-follow
interaction
he
came
across
as
rambling
and
out
of
touch
when
he
was
asked
about
his
past
attitudes
to
historic
racial
discrimination
he
appeared
to
suggest
that
some
african-americans
are
poor
parents
made
a
reference
to
technology
that
has
been
obsolete
for
years
and
then
made
an
odd
diversion
to
speak
about
venezuela
we
bring
social
workers
into
homes
and
parents
to
help
them
deal
with
how
to
raise
their
children
biden
said
it's
not
want
they
don't
want
to
help
they
don't
they
don't
know
quite
what
to
do
play
the
radio
make
sure
the
television
excuse
me
make
sure
you
have
the
record
player
on
at
night
the
the
make
sure
that
kids
hear
words
castro
who
was
up
next
up
quipped
thank
you
very
much
well
that's
quite
a
lot
biden
was
unable
to
make
an
overarching
argument
for
why
trump
should
be
blocked
from
a
second
white
house
term
that's
odd
since
his
entire
campaign
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
president
is
an
assault
on
basic
american
values
it
was
left
to
california
sen
kamala
harris
to
pick
up
that
theme
and
biden
might
regret
giving
her
an
opening
while
he
was
more
nimble
on
his
feet
biden
still
sometimes
began
a
sentence
as
if
he
often
didn't
know
where
it
ended
occasionally
he
inadvertently
stressed
his
age
one
of
his
campaign's
biggest
challenges
given
the
taxing
nature
of
the
presidency
and
the
potency
of
the
youth
vote
in
his
party
for
instance
he
opened
the
debate
talking
about
president
john
kennedy's
moonshot
jfk
is
a
legend
for
democrats
but
also
a
figure
from
the
mists
of
time
for
young
activists
who
unlike
biden
did
not
come
of
age
in
the
era
of
camelot
biden's
explanation
of
his
original
support
for
the
iraq
war
was
meanwhile
confusing
and
mixed
in
a
meandering
argument
about
afghanistan
foreign
policy
is
supposed
to
be
his
strength
and
biden's
repeated
invoking
of
the
presidency
of
barack
obama
who
has
become
a
talismanic
figure
in
his
party
is
beginning
to
look
more
like
a
crutch
than
a
strong
political
point
biden
is
no
longer
the
wisecracking
vibrant
politician
that
he
was
in
the
democratic
race
where
he
was
a
sparkling
debater
who
fell
at
the
first
hurdle
in
iowa
the
years
since
have
been
grueling
for
him
politically
and
especially
personally
but
he
is
still
there
unbowed
and
decent
and
that
may
be
an
asset
in
a
bitter
political
era
when
such
qualities
seem
quaint
candidates
offer
democrats
an
ideological
choice
biden
sanders
and
warren
clash
over
health
care
much
of
the
campaign
is
beyond
biden's
control
so
all
he
can
do
is
put
forward
the
best
version
of
himself
if
democrats
decide
that
they
want
a
progressive
icon
who
inspires
the
liberal
base
and
promises
to
ignite
a
social
revolution
that
remakes
the
face
of
politics
he
has
no
chance
in
that
case
warren
or
even
sanders
have
an
opening
if
a
charismatic
candidate
currently
in
the
second
tier
like
harris
or
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
suddenly
catches
fire
the
former
vice
president
could
be
left
flat-footed
but
if
democrats
reason
that
the
country
needs
a
return
to
a
more
traditional
politics
a
period
of
peace
and
presidential
dignity
after
the
daily
eruptions
from
trump's
white
house
and
a
moderate
then
it
might
be
his
time
given
that
equation
biden
must
prove
he
can
both
make
the
center
left
case
crisply
on
stage
and
that
he
can
parry
attacks
from
rivals
who
are
far
less
vicious
than
the
president
on
balance
that
was
what
biden
did
on
thursday
while
accepting
a
need
for
big
reform
on
issues
like
health
care
biden
was
mindful
of
general
election
voters
and
moderate
democrats
who
balk
at
the
radicalism
of
some
of
his
rivals
clumsy
attacks
and
the
former
vice
president
was
able
to
profit
from
some
clumsy
attacks
from
other
candidates
castro
the
former
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
in
the
obama
administration
made
a
poorly
received
jab
at
biden's
age
when
he
snapped
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
the
attack
a
move
by
a
candidate
desperate
for
traction
in
the
race
is
likely
to
go
down
poorly
among
democrats
for
whom
biden
is
a
much
loved
and
respected
figure
it
also
committed
the
sin
of
mirroring
one
of
trump's
on
the
year-old
democratic
veteran
sanders
stung
biden
into
a
passionate
rejoinder
and
gave
him
a
political
opening
when
he
said
his
health
plan
was
the
only
one
that
could
ensure
someone
who
got
cancer
would
not
go
bankrupt
i
know
a
lot
about
cancer
let
me
tell
you
something
it's
personal
to
me
said
biden
who
lost
his
beloved
adult
son
beau
to
the
disease
in
the
latest
of
a
string
of
family
tragedies
it
helped
biden
that
warren
had
a
quiet
night
so
his
main
foil
in
the
progressive
vs
moderate
contest
was
sanders
whose
voice
apparently
affected
by
a
cold
sounded
more
abrasive
than
normal
one
of
biden's
most
touching
qualities
and
one
of
his
most
powerful
political
skills
is
connecting
with
voters
through
the
prism
of
his
own
life
of
grief
and
loss
he
invoked
the
death
of
his
first
wife
and
daughter
in
a
car
crash
and
beau's
passing
in
his
final
answer
about
how
he
would
show
residence
as
president
for
me
the
way
i've
dealt
with
it
is
finding
purpose
and
my
purpose
is
to
do
what
i've
always
tried
to
do
and
stay
engaged
in
public
policy
but
there's
a
lot
of
people
been
through
a
lot
worse
than
i
have
who
get
up
every
single
morning
put
their
feet
one
foot
in
front
of
another
without
the
help
i
had
he
said
there
are
real
heroes
out
there
some
real
heroes
