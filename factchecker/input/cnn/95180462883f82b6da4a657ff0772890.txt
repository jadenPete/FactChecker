trump
offers
no
more
clarity
on
what
gun
control
policies
he
would
support
trump
focuses
on
mental
health
over
reforming
gun
laws
cnn
president
donald
trump
declined
to
clarify
his
position
on
expanding
gun
background
checks
thursday
after
senior
advisers
presented
him
summaries
of
various
courses
of
action
following
a
month
bookended
by
deadly
mass
shootings
trump
who
is
under
pressure
from
republican
lawmakers
to
specify
where
he
stands
told
reporters
after
the
meeting
that
he
was
prepared
to
take
action
but
he
refused
to
specify
on
what
i
think
we
made
some
good
progress
on
background
checks
and
guns
the
president
said
after
emerging
from
the
briefing
trump
said
he
was
discussing
various
options
with
democrats
and
republicans
and
that
he
believed
both
sides
wanted
to
see
action
but
asked
specifically
whether
he
was
supporting
expanding
background
checks
trump
demurred
saying
it
depended
on
the
final
measure
it
depends
on
if
democrats
want
to
take
your
guns
away
he
said
if
this
is
a
movement
by
the
democrats
to
take
your
guns
away
it's
never
going
to
happen
the
answer
did
not
provide
the
clarity
many
lawmakers
had
been
hoping
for
from
the
president
as
they
prepare
to
debate
gun
control
legislation
trump
while
open
to
supporting
significant
new
legislation
has
not
decided
whether
to
back
expanded
background
checks
a
person
with
knowledge
of
the
situation
said
instead
he
has
asked
for
additional
talks
among
senators
administration
officials
and
attorney
general
bill
barr
to
see
if
a
proposal
can
be
worked
out
it's
still
unclear
if
the
white
house
will
offer
such
a
proposal
or
issue
a
broader
statement
of
principles
the
president
has
yet
to
decide
the
person
said
the
issue
assumed
new
urgency
after
another
mass
shooting
at
the
end
of
august
in
texas
the
month
began
with
gruesome
massacres
in
el
paso
and
dayton
trump
vowed
action
and
even
expressed
some
openness
to
expanding
background
checks
but
after
conversations
with
political
advisers
and
leadership
from
the
national
rifle
association
the
president's
support
for
background
checks
softened
he's
since
been
vague
about
what
he
will
support
congress
returns
to
a
gun
debate
and
fight
over
funding
the
government
still
he's
remained
committed
to
getting
behind
some
type
of
change
white
house
aides
have
spent
the
last
month
meeting
with
congressional
staffs
to
devise
a
package
of
revisions
following
the
spree
of
deadly
mass
shootings
the
justice
department
also
prepared
a
package
of
options
that
was
delivered
to
the
white
house
more
than
two
weeks
ago
what
isn't
known
yet
is
whether
trump
will
get
behind
a
measure
expanding
background
checks
including
a
bipartisan
one
championed
by
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
of
west
virginia
and
republican
sen
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
trump
spoke
with
those
lawmakers
along
with
democratic
sen
chris
murphy
of
connecticut
on
wednesday
but
the
lawmakers
walked
away
without
a
clear
view
of
whether
the
president
would
back
their
proposal
which
failed
to
gain
enough
support
for
passage
in
some
republicans
who
voted
against
the
toomey-manchin
bill
then
have
since
said
they
could
reconsider
it
now
republican
sen
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
who
is
close
to
trump
signaled
thursday
that
he
is
open
to
expanding
background
checks
he
said
he
had
discussed
the
matter
with
the
president
on
wednesday
evening
while
graham
did
not
explicitly
say
he'd
back
manchin-toomey
now
he
said
it
was
a
direction
he
was
leaning
asked
if
he
was
willing
to
change
his
vote
he
said
yes
privately
barr
has
been
nudging
trump
to
get
behind
a
measure
expanding
background
checks
and
the
president
has
not
ruled
it
out
but
some
of
his
political
advisers
have
advised
him
against
it
citing
polling
showing
such
a
step
would
prove
unpopular
among
his
political
base
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
said
he'll
move
only
on
legislation
that
has
trump's
clear
support
which
so
far
has
not
been
forthcoming
in
thursday's
meeting
trump
was
briefed
on
summaries
of
each
of
the
items
that
are
up
for
consideration
