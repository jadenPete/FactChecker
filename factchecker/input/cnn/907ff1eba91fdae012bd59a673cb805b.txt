at

introduced
wheeler
and

what
bodies
of

a
favorite
punching
bag
of
republicans
who
ridicule
it
as
government
overreach
democrats
defended
it
as
necessary
to
ensure
waterways
remained
pollution-free

the
trump

finalizing
its
proposal
for
a
replacement

environmental
groups
are
panning
the
move

promising
further
legal
challenges
the
trump
administration's
wild-eyed
attempts
to
reward
polluters
the
natural
resources
defense
council's
jon
devine
said
knows
no
bounds
so
it
is
repealing
these
important
protections
without
regard
for
the
law
or
sound
science
