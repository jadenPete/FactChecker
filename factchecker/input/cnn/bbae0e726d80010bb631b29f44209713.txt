obama
says
presidents
shouldn't
watch
tv
or
read
social
media
trump
suggests
investigation
into
obama-netflix
deal
washington
cnn
former
president
barack
obama
on
wednesday
offered
up
his
advice
for
clear
decision-making
in
the
oval
office
avoid
tv
and
social
media
which
only
clouds
your
judgment
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
create
a
process
where
you
have
confidence
that
whatever
data
is
out
there
has
been
sifted
sorted
and
the
core
issues
that
are
going
to
be
important
to
your
decision
you're
able
to
see
it
around
obama
said
during
an
interview
onstage
at
a
technology
conference
in
san
francisco
and
that
requires
not
just
a
good
process
but
making
sure
you
have
a
team
that's
got
a
diversity
of
opinion
the
other
thing
that's
helpful
is
not
watching
tv
or
you
know
reading
you
know
social
media
he
said
to
a
cheering
crowd
so
those
are
two
things
i
would
advise
if
you're
president
not
to
do
because
it
creates
a
lot
of
noise
and
clouds
your
judgment
while
obama
didn't
name
president
donald
trump
in
his
remarks
about
tv
and
social
media
obama's
successor
is
a
prolific
viewer
of
cable
news
and
a
frequent
tweeter
obama
has
occasionally
criticized
the
president
such
as
when
trump
ended
the
obama-era
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
program
and
in
the
wake
of
trump's
first
travel
ban
executive
order
but
it
is
rare
for
modern
presidents
to
criticize
their
successors
when
referring
to
current
news
obama
has
frequently
avoided
using
trump's
name
jon
favreau
a
former
speechwriter
for
obama
said
on
wednesday
that
i
really
doubt
this
was
a
swipe
at
trump
insisting
instead
it
was
just
general
advice
obama
said
this
kinda
thing
about
not
watching
tv
and
being
on
social
media
hundreds
of
times
publicly
before
trump
was
even
a
candidate
for
president
favreau
said
on
twitter
obama
said
wednesday
that
it's
important
that
presidents
be
clear
that
you
want
facts
without
sugarcoating
you
can
make
sure
that
people
who
are
providing
you
that
information
get
a
clear
signal
from
you
that
you
want
facts
and
you
want
bad
news
first
and
you
don't
want
spinning
and
you
don't
want
sugarcoating
and
you
want
a
diversity
of
opinion
and
you
send
that
signal
strong
at
the
outset
he
added
that
presidents
shouldn't
become
concerned
with
outside
signals
that
can
sway
your
decision-making
in
an
unhealthy
way
if
you
are
susceptible
to
worrying
about
what
are
the
polls
saying
or
what
might
this
person
say
about
this
topic
or
you
start
mistaking
the
intensity
of
the
passion
of
a
very
small
subset
of
people
with
a
broader
sense
of
how
the
country
or
people
who
actually
know
something
about
the
topic
you're
dealing
with
think
that
will
sway
your
decision-making
in
an
unhealthy
way
he
said
the
former
president
also
expressed
concern
about
the
harmful
effects
social
media
can
have
on
democracy
the
rise
of
the
division
globally
not
just
here
in
the
united
states
and
the
degree
to
which
we
have
become
more
tribal
more
polarized
less
willing
to
listen
to
each
other
and
that
predated
social
media
but
social
media
has
accelerated
it
he
said
while
praising
modern
gadgetry
as
a
way
to
communicate
with
his
daughters
obama
also
said
technology
can
also
hinder
human
connection
split
people
apart
