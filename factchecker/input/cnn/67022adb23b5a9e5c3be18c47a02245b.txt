yang
racial
epithets
hurt
but
different
with
comedians
washington
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
andrew
yang
again
responded
to
racist
comments
made
by
new
saturday
night
live
hire
shane
gillis
saying
he's
faced
anti-asian
racism
throughout
his
upbringing
but
also
that
our
country
has
become
excessively
punitive
and
vindictive
about
remarks
that
people
find
offensive
or
racist
yang
who
is
taiwanese-american
told
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
state
of
the
union
sunday
that
racial
epithets
hurt
and
should
be
taken
seriously
but
also
softened
his
criticism
saying
gillis
comments
should
be
taken
differently
because
he
is
a
comedian
i've
experienced
a
lot
of
anti-asian
racism
throughout
my
upbringing
and
it
hurts
it
is
something
that
is
very
real
he
said
and
i
do
think
anti-asian
racial
epithets
are
not
taken
as
seriously
as
slurs
against
other
groups
but
at
the
same
time
bigger
picture
i
believe
that
our
country
has
become
excessively
punitive
and
vindictive
about
remarks
that
people
find
offensive
or
racist
and
that
we
need
to
try
and
move
beyond
that
if
we
can
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
person
is
in
this
case
to
me
like
a
comedian
whose
words
should
be
taken
in
a
slightly
different
light
yang
wades
into
backlash
over
new
snl
cast
member's
bigoted
comments
yang's
sunday
reaction
marks
his
latest
on
the
comments
resurfaced
by
freelance
writer
seth
simons
simons
tweeted
a
two-minute
video
clip
of
gillis
podcast
matt
and
shane's
secret
podcast
recorded
last
year
in
which
gillis
says
on
the
video
let
the
f-
ing
ch-
ks
live
there
of
chinatown
gillis
also
mocks
a
chinese
accent
the
language
barrier
and
says
chinatown's
f-
ing
nuts
the
video
recording
of
the
podcast
episode
has
been
deleted
from
youtube
and
gillis
posted
a
statement
on
twitter
thursday
night
saying
if
you
go
through
my
years
of
comedy
most
of
it
bad
you're
going
to
find
a
lot
of
bad
misses
and
adding
he's
happy
to
apologize
to
anyone
who's
actually
offended
by
anything
i've
said
my
intention
is
never
to
hurt
anyone
but
i
am
trying
to
be
the
best
comedian
i
can
be
and
sometimes
that
requires
risks
yang
first
responded
to
gills
in
a
twitter
thread
on
saturday
saying
he
prefers
comedy
that
makes
people
think
and
doesn't
take
cheap
shots
he
also
wrote
he
is
open
to
meeting
with
gillis
and
doesn't
think
he
should
lose
his
job
we
would
benefit
from
being
more
forgiving
rather
than
punitive
yang
tweeted
but
if
i
can
forgive
shane
as
the
guy
he
called
a
slur
i
hope
others
can
as
well
he
wrote
i
also
hope
shane
is
open
to
learning
we
are
all
human
we're
all
fallible
yang's
own
jokes
yang
himself
is
a
complicated
figure
to
highlight
the
racist
comments
at
the
third
democratic
debate
in
houston
on
thursday
yang
cracked
an
off-color
joke
as
he
discussed
health
care
and
the
mounting
paperwork
doctors
face
i'm
asian
so
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
yang
said
the
joke
was
criticized
by
some
on
social
media
and
asian
american
commentators
accused
yang
of
leaning
on
the
model
minority
asian
stereotype
at
a
campaign
stop
in
seattle
yang
called
his
campaign
the
nerdiest
presidential
campaign
in
history
merchandise
on
yang's
website
include
a
hat
with
math
on
it
and
notebooks
with
a
picture
of
yang
as
an
awkward
teenager
when
asked
sunday
about
the
candidate's
own
jokes
referencing
asian
stereotypes
yang
characterized
his
comments
as
merely
poking
fun
at
such
stereotypes
to
urge
americans
to
reflect
on
them
i
would
never
claim
that
my
individual
experience
would
speak
to
the
depth
and
breadth
of
our
community
he
told
tapper
at
the
same
time
i
think
americans
are
very
smart
and
that
they
can
actually
see
right
through
that
kind
of
myth
and
if
anything
by
poking
fun
at
it
i'm
making
americans
reflect
a
little
bit
more
on
them
