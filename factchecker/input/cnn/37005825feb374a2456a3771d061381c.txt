pompeo
says
saudi
attack
an
act
of
war
as
trump
sounds
more
cautious
note
washington
cnn
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
called
the
attack
on
saudi
oil
facilities
an
act
of
war
wednesday
as
president
donald
trump
announced
that
he's
ordered
new
sanctions
on
tehran
the
latest
escalation
in
tensions
between
the
two
countries
as
us
officials
work
to
pin
the
blame
on
iran
pompeo
who
is
in
saudi
arabia
to
consult
with
the
kingdom's
rulers
on
next
steps
said
we
were
blessed
that
there
were
no
americans
killed
in
this
attack
but
anytime
you
have
an
act
of
war
of
this
nature
there's
always
risk
that
that
could
happen
this
is
an
attack
of
a
scale
we've
just
not
seen
before
the
top
us
diplomat
said
he
is
in
the
middle
east
to
build
a
coalition
to
deter
iran
and
signaled
that
the
trump
administration
will
use
the
upcoming
gathering
of
world
leaders
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
to
rally
support
for
action
against
tehran
which
denies
involvement
in
the
saudi
attack
it's
very
easy
to
start
i'm
confident
that
in
new
york
we'll
talk
a
lot
about
this
and
that
the
saudis
will
too
pompeo
said
it
was
on
their
soil
it
was
an
act
of
war
against
them
directly
and
i'm
confident
that
they
will
do
that
pompeo's
combative
characterization
of
the
attack
came
as
saudi
arabia
presented
pieces
of
weaponry
it
said
tied
iran
to
the
attack
vice
president
mike
pence
has
suggested
a
military
retaliation
is
possible
and
some
republican
lawmakers
have
said
tehran
should
get
an
unequivocal
response
but
the
president
and
us
allies
are
sending
conflicting
signals
trump
who
campaigned
on
getting
the
us
out
of
foreign
fights
and
has
been
critical
of
american
involvement
in
the
iraq
and
afghanistan
wars
faces
a
battle
for
reelection
that
would
be
complicated
by
a
new
conflict
and
saudi
officials
have
made
clear
to
the
white
house
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
dragged
into
war
either
the
president's
sanctions
announcement
may
signal
his
desire
to
avoid
military
conflict
analysts
said
and
in
remarks
to
reporters
in
los
angeles
on
wednesday
the
president
observed
that
it
is
easy
to
slip
into
a
war
it's
very
easy
to
start
trump
said
if
we
have
to
do
something
we'll
do
it
adding
that
we'll
be
adding
some
very
significant
sanctions
against
iran
substitute
not
prelude
asked
if
he's
looking
at
a
military
strike
the
president
said
we'll
see
what
happens
he
noted
that
there's
the
ultimate
option
and
there
are
options
less
powerful
than
that
the
ultimate
option
meaning
go
in
war
the
us
has
yet
to
offer
definitive
proof
that
iran
conducted
the
attack
which
has
been
claimed
by
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
us
officials
have
denied
that's
possible
pompeo
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
houthis
had
the
capability
as
for
how
we
know
the
equipment
used
is
unknown
to
be
in
the
houthi
arsenal
pompeo
said
speaking
to
reporters
off-camera
before
landing
in
jeddah
the
intelligence
community
has
high
confidence
that
these
were
not
weapons
that
would
have
been
in
the
possession
of
the
houthis
that's
probably
the
most
important
piece
of
information
but
a
united
nations
report
says
otherwise
in
a
january
report
by
yemen
experts
the
un
wrote
about
new
powerful
houthi
drones
capable
of
targeting
saudi
arabia
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
the
uav-x
is
its
significantly
increased
endurance
and
range
the
report
said
adding
that
it
may
have
a
maximum
range
of
between
km
and
km
depending
on
wind
conditions
it
would
give
credence
to
the
claims
by
the
houthis
that
they
have
the
capability
to
hit
targets
such
as
riyadh
abu
dhabi
and
dubai
it
doesn't
matter
pompeo
asked
wednesday
why
the
houthis
couldn't
be
responsible
for
the
attack
made
clear
that
regardless
of
who
actually
it
carried
out
the
us
will
hold
iran
responsible
it
doesn't
matter
pompeo
answered
this
was
an
iranian
attack
it's
not
the
case
that
you
can
subcontract
out
the
devastation
of
five
percent
of
the
world's
global
energy
supply
and
think
that
you
can
absolve
yourself
of
responsibilities
if
the
houthis
claim
turns
out
to
be
true
it
doesn't
change
the
fingerprints
of
the
ayatollah
as
having
put
at
risk
the
global
energy
supply
pompeo
said
allies
have
taken
a
more
cautious
approach
with
france
and
the
united
nations
sending
investigators
to
the
kingdom
and
japanese
officials
saying
there
is
a
high
possibility
the
houthis
are
indeed
responsible
even
saudi
arabia
has
been
more
careful
linking
tehran
to
the
attack
but
not
calling
it
an
act
of
war
or
saying
as
unnamed
us
officials
have
claimed
that
iran
itself
launched
the
attack
from
within
its
territory
that
wasn't
an
attack
on
us
the
kingdom
has
made
clear
to
the
us
that
it
does
not
want
a
war
sources
familiar
with
saudi-us
discussions
say
when
saudi
defense
minister
prince
khalid
bin
salman
met
with
senior
administration
officials
at
the
state
department
the
pentagon
and
the
cia
in
late
august
he
told
them
the
saudis
wanted
the
us
to
maintain
the
economic
squeeze
on
iran
but
asked
the
administration
not
take
any
action
to
start
a
war
that
the
kingdom
could
get
dragged
into
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
for
his
part
trump
has
made
clear
he
wants
the
saudis
to
take
the
lead
in
any
response
since
it
was
an
attack
on
their
soil
we
have
to
sit
down
with
the
saudis
and
work
something
out
he
told
reporters
on
tuesday
that
was
an
attack
on
saudi
arabia
and
that
wasn't
an
attack
on
us
and
administration
officials
have
said
a
decision
on
a
response
to
the
weekend
attacks
won't
be
made
until
pompeo
returns
to
washington
kirsten
fontenrose
a
former
director
of
the
persian
gulf
region
on
trump's
national
security
council
said
that
since
the
white
house
already
knows
where
the
saudis
stand
it
may
be
planning
to
use
the
kingdom
to
give
it
cover
for
not
taking
military
action
this
gives
him
trump
a
way
out
to
not
push
for
kinetic
action
fontenrose
said
fall
short
sen
lindsey
graham
a
south
carolina
republican
and
trump
ally
had
criticized
trump's
sanctions
approach
saying
iran
saw
it
as
a
sign
of
weakness
on
wednesday
graham
said
he
is
looking
for
a
response
that
would
restore
deterrence
and
my
belief
is
additional
sanctions
will
fall
short
trump
said
wednesday
that
he
and
graham
have
a
disagreement
on
that
and
there's
plenty
of
time
to
do
some
dastardly
things
earlier
in
the
day
trump
tweeted
that
i
have
just
instructed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
substantially
increase
sanctions
on
the
country
of
iran
henry
rome
an
iran
analyst
at
the
eurasia
group
said
the
tweet
was
important
because
it
appears
to
be
trump's
effort
to
respond
to
the
iranian
attack
by
sanctions
measures
and
not
by
military
steps
the
way
i
look
at
it
this
is
the
substitute
for
a
military
response
not
the
prelude
to
it
rome
said
fairly
marginal
it
wasn't
immediately
clear
to
whom
or
which
sectors
the
new
sanctions
would
apply
white
house
treasury
and
state
department
spokespeople
did
not
immediately
offer
details
trump
said
wednesday
that
an
announcement
would
be
made
in
the
next
hours
without
specifying
whether
it
would
be
on
sanctions
or
some
other
aspect
the
us
has
ratcheted
up
pressure
on
iran
after
withdrawing
last
year
from
a
multi-nation
nuclear
deal
that
constrained
iran's
nuclear
activity
in
return
for
an
easing
of
economic
sanctions
the
us
maximum
pressure
policy
has
undermined
the
nuclear
deal
creating
tensions
with
european
allies
who
are
trying
to
keep
the
nuclear
deal
afloat
the
trump
administration
has
sanctioned
all
key
iranian
economic
sectors
including
aviation
and
shipping
and
in
may
it
hit
the
lifeblood
of
tehran's
economy
sanctioning
its
energy
exports
the
trump
administration
has
ratcheted
sanctions
up
to
the
point
that
rome
said
at
this
point
the
us
is
scraping
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
with
sanctions
after
the
decision
to
sanction
iranian
oil
in
may
everything
else
is
fairly
marginal
when
you
look
at
effectiveness
or
impact
you're
really
out
of
significant
sanction
tools
at
this
point
