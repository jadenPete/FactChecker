clash
over
health
care
philadelphia
cnn
with
united
auto
workers
still
patrolling
the
picket
lines
in
their
strike
against
general
motors
presidential
candidates
bernie
sanders
and
joe
biden
spent
tuesday
drawing
sharp
distinctions
over
their
plans
for
health
care
in
a
way
that
could
directly
impact
those
on
strike
gm
revealed
that
health
care
benefits
for
those
on
strike
will
soon
come
to
an
end
meaning
the
union
will
be
forced
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
cobra
coverage
sanders
who
has
faced
criticism
over
how
his
medicare
for
all
plan
would
impact
unions
and
their
negotiated
benefits
argued
that
if
his
plan
were
the
law
of
the
land
those
striking
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
their
coverage
here
you
have
a
situation
with
uaw
is
out
on
strike
workers
i
am
sure
that
in
that
there
are
family
members
who
are
seriously
ill
and
yet
the
greed
of
general
motors
which
has
the
amount
of
money
to
pay
their
ceo
something
like
million
a
year
they
cut
off
the
health
care
benefits
for
those
workers
sanders
said
under
medicare
for
all
every
american
whether
you're
working
whether
you're
not
working
when
you
are
going
from
one
job
to
another
job
it's
there
with
you
earlier
in
the
day
at
a
presidential
forum
hosted
by
the
afl-cio
in
philadelphia
biden
took
a
subtle
shot
at
the
sanders
plan
without
mentioning
sanders
or
medicare
for
all
by
name
the
former
vice
president
volunteered
that
his
health
care
plan
would
protect
the
union's
right
to
negotiate
its
own
health
care
benefits
with
its
employer
i
have
a
significant
health
care
plan
biden
said
but
guess
what
under
mine
you
can
keep
your
health
insurance
you
bargained
for
if
you
like
it
if
you
don't
you
can
move
and
you
can
come
into
a
public
plan
sanders
took
issue
with
biden's
assessment
that's
wrong
said
the
independent
senator
from
vermont
the
united
states
has
got
to
join
every
other
major
country
on
earth
and
guarantee
health
care
to
all
people
union
workers
and
nonunion
workers
as
a
right
two
key
sanders
advisers
later
offered
an
even
tougher
assessment
of
biden's
position
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
called
biden
pinocchio
joe
on
twitter
while
senior
adviser
warren
gunnels
responded
to
the
biden
comments
forcefully
try
telling
that
to
the
uaw
workers
who
had
their
benefits
taken
away
from
them
by
gm
gunnels
wrote
on
twitter
medicare
for
all
is
the
only
way
to
make
sure
that
no
american
will
ever
lose
their
health
insurance
ever
again
and
workers
will
finally
receive
the
higher
wages
and
benefits
they
need
and
deserve
labor
groups
have
raised
questions
about
what
would
happen
to
the
benefits
they've
negotiated
into
collective
bargaining
agreements
if
medicare
for
all
becomes
law
sanders
plan
effectively
eliminates
private
insurance
but
does
allow
it
to
continue
private
plans
can
be
sold
as
long
as
they
don't
offer
the
same
benefits
as
medicare
for
all
sanders
has
said
unions
could
continue
to
offer
health
plans
with
extra
benefits
not
covered
by
medicare
for
all
he
has
also
promised
that
he
would
require
those
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
unions
and
companies
to
be
renegotiated
and
any
savings
provided
to
the
companies
be
distributed
to
employees
in
the
form
of
better
salaries
and
other
benefits
biden
believes
that
step
shouldn't
be
necessary
you've
broken
your
neck
to
get
it
you've
given
up
wages
to
get
it
you
should
be
entitled
to
keep
it
and
no
plan
should
take
it
away
from
you
if
that's
what
you
decide
he
said
sanders
has
long
contended
that
guaranteeing
the
benefits
to
all
would
put
union
members
further
ahead
in
the
long
run
this
is
a
dysfunctional
system
designed
to
make
billion
in
profits
for
the
drug
companies
and
the
insurance
companies
not
one
that
provides
quality
care
to
all
and
that's
what
the
fight
is
about
he
said
