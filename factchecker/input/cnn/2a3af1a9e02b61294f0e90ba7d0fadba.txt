absurd
lewandowski
hearing
raises
doubts
about
dems
strategy
washington
cnn
it
was
meant
to
be
the
moment
when
democrats
started
to
knit
a
narrative
of
presidential
malfeasance
that
many
of
them
hope
will
trigger
impeachment
but
it
turned
into
an
iconic
trump-era
spectacle
that
served
instead
to
show
how
the
white
house
and
its
acolytes
have
made
a
mockery
of
the
checks
and
balances
of
the
washington
system
a
farcical
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
tuesday
featuring
corey
lewandowski
president
donald
trump's
ex-campaign
manager
emphasized
how
democrats
are
struggling
to
hold
trump
to
account
party
leaders
were
left
to
explain
why
they
had
not
been
more
nimble
in
questioning
a
witness
loaded
for
bear
since
everyone
knew
lewandowski
would
show
up
with
the
intention
of
causing
havoc
after
hours
of
frustrating
cross-examination
that
one
of
their
number
rep
hank
johnson
of
georgia
compared
to
a
fish
being
cleaned
with
a
spoon
democrats
were
left
with
a
conundrum
how
to
use
televised
hearings
to
tease
out
damning
passages
of
the
mueller
report
when
trump
and
his
gang
are
determined
to
turn
them
into
a
circus
lewandowski
stonewalls
and
frustrates
democrats
in
contentious
capitol
hill
hearing
their
broader
strategy
of
using
their
house
majority
to
slowly
build
a
pattern
of
presidential
abuse
of
power
and
obstruction
of
justice
has
yet
to
reach
a
critical
mass
on
the
evidence
of
tuesday
it
may
never
do
so
it
was
a
great
day
for
the
white
house
however
trump
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
hearing
on
wednesday
morning
tweeting
that
it
showed
president
trump
didn't
do
anything
wrong
or
illegal
but
they
all
know
that
the
democrats
are
hurting
our
country
and
getting
nothing
done
shameful
democrats
did
manage
to
get
lewandowski
to
confirm
some
details
of
the
mueller
report
that
could
damage
the
president
and
questioned
lewandowski's
credibility
by
getting
him
to
say
he
had
no
obligation
to
be
honest
to
the
media
but
the
hearing
was
a
microcosm
of
the
trump
presidency
itself
as
it
pulsated
with
distraction
outrage
and
obstructive
behavior
designed
to
evade
scrutiny
and
accountability
the
white
house
strategy
of
curtailing
lewandowski's
testimony
by
foreshadowing
controversial
executive
privilege
claims
appeared
to
be
an
attempt
to
goad
democrats
into
another
protracted
court
battle
that
could
delay
a
day
of
reckoning
by
sunset
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-new
york
warned
that
lewandowski
risked
being
held
in
contempt
for
helping
a
white
house
desperate
for
the
american
people
not
to
hear
the
truth
trump's
army
of
republican
committee
members
meanwhile
more
eager
to
catch
his
eye
as
he
watched
on
air
force
one
than
to
honor
their
lawmakers
duty
to
constrain
the
executive
played
along
with
lewandowski
relishing
the
chance
to
grandstand
you
had
a
pretty
good
candidate
said
rep
jim
jordan
an
ohio
republican
who's
one
of
trump's
closest
allies
in
congress
the
best
the
ex-campaign
manager
replied
a
new
step
toward
impeachment
democrat
presses
lewandowski
are
you
ashamed
the
hearing
marked
the
first
big
oversight
drama
since
democrats
redefined
the
rules
of
their
investigation
to
style
committee
meetings
as
impeachment
hearings
though
democrats
have
yet
to
open
a
full
impeachment
process
the
decision
sent
an
important
statement
to
activists
and
lawmakers
who
think
party
leaders
are
moving
too
slowly
against
a
president
they
see
as
guilty
of
a
riot
of
law
breaking
but
when
lewandowski's
histrionics
and
gop
obstruction
tactics
caused
nadler
to
begin
rolling
his
eyes
moments
into
the
hearing
it
was
a
sign
of
how
contentious
things
would
become
some
democrats
tacitly
admitted
that
the
white
house
currently
has
the
upper
hand
but
predicted
the
tables
would
turn
the
president
credit
to
him
is
winning
the
short
game
he
is
successfully
obstructing
and
confusing
the
american
people
rep
eric
swalwell
a
california
democrat
told
cnn's
erin
burnett
but
there
is
going
to
be
a
cascade
of
court
opinions
against
him
saying
that
the
obstruction
telling
witnesses
not
to
testify
is
unlawful
he
said
the
ultimate
trump
loyalist
see
the
questions
lewandowski
refused
to
answer
perhaps
the
most
trumpian
of
the
president's
men
lewandowski
put
on
a
bravura
performance
dodging
questions
playing
for
time
and
lavishing
praise
on
the
commander
in
chief
repeatedly
playing
the
role
of
a
conscientious
witness
lewandowski
asked
for
page
references
to
flesh
out
questions
by
democratic
lawmakers
a
tip
he
might
have
picked
up
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
appearance
in
july
his
prepared
testimony
sounded
like
an
opening
monologue
by
fox
news
host
sean
hannity
hitting
conservative
talking
points
on
the
russia
inquiry
immigration
and
hillary
clinton's
emails
recalling
the
president's
journey
down
the
golden
escalator
in
trump
tower
to
launch
his
campaign
like
an
awakening
lewandowski
lauded
his
former
candidate's
unprecedented
political
juggernaut
it
wasn't
long
before
trump
thanked
lewandowski
who
would
benefit
from
the
president's
support
if
as
expected
he
launches
a
senate
run
in
new
hampshire
next
year
such
a
beautiful
opening
statement
trump
tweeted
sporting
a
severe
short-back-and-sides
haircut
that
vaguely
recalled
the
flattop
once
modeled
by
president
richard
nixon's
political
henchman
h.r.
haldeman
lewandowski
stood
firm
in
the
face
of
volleys
of
democratic
attacks
adding
to
the
s
vibe
nadler
warned
lewandowski
he
was
treading
dangerous
historic
ground
i
will
remind
you
that
article
of
the
impeachment
against
president
nixon
was
based
on
obstruction
of
congress
you
are
instructed
to
answer
the
questions
nadler
said
lewandowski's
tactics
revealed
just
how
far
the
white
house
plans
to
go
in
pursuit
of
an
expansive
and
questionable
executive
privilege
strategy
at
one
point
he
was
asked
about
conversations
he'd
had
with
the
president
about
payments
made
to
several
women
who
claimed
they'd
had
affairs
with
trump
years
before
the
election
when
lewandowski
played
his
executive
privilege
card
for
the
umpteenth
time
nadler
warned
i
believe
the
nixon
case
established
the
very
ironclad
principle
that
discussions
regarding
criminal
acts
are
not
privileged
there
is
no
jurisprudence
to
support
the
white
house's
claim
that
people
such
as
lewandowski
who
were
not
even
employed
by
the
federal
government
can
be
covered
by
executive
privilege
claims
but
the
strategy
is
effective
as
a
stalling
tactic
democrats
may
need
to
rethink
lewandowski
calls
lawmaker's
questioning
just
a
rant
some
commentators
are
suggesting
that
the
aggressive
white
house
approach
means
democrats
will
have
to
adjust
their
tactics
it
is
itself
obstructive
that
the
white
house
would
be
attempting
to
actually
prevent
witnesses
from
testifying
susan
hennessey
a
cnn
national
security
and
legal
analyst
said
on
the
situation
room
however
it
is
a
really
really
effective
tactic
and
until
congress
can
adjust
their
strategy
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
the
hostile
witnesses
how
to
deal
with
this
stonewalling
this
is
going
to
continue
to
be
a
challenge
she
said
several
democrats
pressed
lewandowski
on
mueller's
finding
that
trump
had
asked
him
to
lean
on
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
curtail
the
special
counsel's
investigation
lewandowski
did
not
follow
through
on
the
request
initially
lewandowski
declined
to
talk
about
the
discussions
he
later
changed
tactics
and
under
questioning
from
johnson
confirmed
mueller's
finding
that
the
president
had
asked
him
to
tell
sessions
he
was
unhappy
with
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
and
that
he
had
written
down
the
message
you
felt
a
little
squeamish
about
delivering
the
message
correct
johnson
asked
lewandowski
you
chickened
out
the
witness
replied
i
went
on
vacation
the
revelation
was
the
most
significant
deliverable
from
the
hearing
from
the
democrats
and
could
eventually
form
part
of
a
damning
case
against
the
president
but
the
fact
it
took
so
long
to
extract
and
will
be
overshadowed
by
the
antics
of
lewandowski
and
his
republican
supporters
underlines
the
daunting
nature
of
the
democrats
task
it
was
a
brief
moment
in
an
afternoon
of
ill-tempered
futility
exemplified
by
a
clash
between
lewandowski
and
rep
jamie
raskin
a
maryland
democrat
who
told
the
witness
his
executive
privilege
arguments
were
as
believable
as
the
tooth
fairy
my
children
are
watching
so
thank
you
for
that
lewandowski
replied
