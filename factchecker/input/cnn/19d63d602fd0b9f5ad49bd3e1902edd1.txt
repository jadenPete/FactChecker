elizabeth
warren
took
selfies
for
hours
after
her
new
york
rally
it's
part
of
her
plan
elizabeth
warren
mastered
the
art
of
the
selfie
line
new
york
cnn
it
had
been
hours
since
sen
elizabeth
warren
wrapped
her
speech
here
in
manhattan
but
the
scene
in
washington
square
park
suggested
her
work
was
far
from
done
warren
stuck
around
deep
into
the
new
york
night
on
monday
taking
photos
with
each
person
who'd
waited
in
line
a
process
that
took
nearly
fives
times
as
long
as
the
candidate
spent
delivering
an
impassioned
anti-corruption
address
to
the
thousands
who
filled
the
park
the
warren
selfies
the
photos
she
takes
with
voters
framed
and
snapped
by
a
campaign
aide
as
other
staffers
hustle
supporters
through
handling
their
bags
and
phones
so
warren
can
take
as
many
photos
as
quickly
as
possible
have
become
a
political
phenomenon
it's
one
that
manages
to
be
both
savvy
and
kitschy
exhausting
and
exhilarating
a
lot
it
turns
out
like
running
for
president
a
warren
aide
told
cnn
on
tuesday
that
she
took
about
selfies
after
her
new
york
rally
and
has
now
since
kicking
off
her
campaign
last
winter
posed
for
more
than
of
them
in
all
you
know
the
lines
keep
getting
longer
that's
a
good
thing
warren
said
tuesday
i
put
on
my
sneakers
and
a
cooler
sweater
so
that
we
can
keep
doing
it
last
night
but
it
was
terrific
it
was
being
able
to
say
heart-to-heart
to
people
who
came
in
from
all
around
the
area
and
who
really
are
in
this
fight
who
believe
that
we're
going
to
get
together
we're
going
to
fight
hard
and
we're
going
to
change
this
country
the
photo
lines
have
become
as
much
a
part
of
the
warren
stump
menu
as
her
sharp
populist
rhetoric
but
as
the
campaign
is
quick
to
remind
they
are
very
much
part
of
the
same
meal
all
that
time
warren
spends
with
voters
after
events
wouldn't
be
there
if
she
were
tied
down
with
other
more
onerous
fundraising
duties
like
dialing
rich
donors
for
cash
she
forswore
that
practice
early
in
the
campaign
so
instead
of
filling
her
schedule
with
those
calls
and
leaving
voters
to
hang
over
a
ropeline
as
many
other
of
her
democratic
rivals
do
she
instead
opts
to
do
it
all
at
once
roger
lau
warren's
campaign
manager
described
to
cnn
in
a
june
interview
how
the
warren
version
of
the
selfie
line
came
to
be
the
time
i
remember
most
vividly
disagreeing
with
her
was
about
the
selfie
line
lau
said
of
his
boss
and
their
discussions
in
when
she
was
running
for
re-election
to
the
senate
she
said
no
no
why
do
we
do
rope
lines
and
i
said
we
do
rope
lines
because
one
we
want
to
touch
volunteers
and
engage
with
them
people
appreciate
that
two
the
press
appreciates
that
and
three
people
end
up
taking
photos
and
when
they
take
those
photos
it
goes
mini-viral
within
their
networks
and
you
know
it's
good
for
organizing
he
said
warren
came
to
him
with
a
counterproposal
what
if
we
invited
every
single
person
who
wanted
to
come
to
stage
to
take
a
photo
and
to
you
know
come
on
stage
lau
was
unmoved
i
said
no
we
can't
do
that
lau
said
and
she
said
why
and
i
said
it's
going
to
take
forever
and
you're
going
to
be
tired
and
it's
going
to
be
exhausting
and
she
said
i
want
to
do
it
anyway
we
went
back
and
forth
for
a
few
weeks
the
turning
point
lau
said
came
before
their
first
town
hall
in
framingham
warren
persisted
roger
i
trust
you
she
said
as
he
remembers
the
decision
coming
down
i
know
you're
always
there
for
me
you
always
protect
me
you
decide
what
you
want
to
do
but
if
there's
even
a
single
person
in
that
room
that
wants
to
say
hello
who
wants
to
take
a
photo
who
didn't
get
a
photo
i
will
have
considered
this
event
a
failure
so
after
that
we
decided
to
do
it
months
on
warren
has
done
the
selfie
line
at
all
of
her
large
town
halls
across
the
country
in
los
angeles
last
month
at
the
shrine
expo
hall
at
the
university
of
southern
california
thousands
of
people
waited
in
a
line
that
wrapped
around
the
perimeters
of
the
venue
to
take
a
photo
with
her
she
has
passion
and
the
passion
is
what
drives
her
who
needs
caffeine
when
you've
got
true
caring
attendee
robin
cohen
told
cnn
indeed
warren
does
not
drink
coffee
and
in
seattle
last
month
the
photo
queue
wrapped
around
the
spacious
park
underneath
the
space
needle
and
took
four
hours
to
finish
at
the
end
warren
took
photos
with
the
staff
of
the
park
who
helped
with
the
event
another
increasingly
common
practice
the
campaign
told
cnn
that
even
if
her
rallies
get
bigger
warren
won't
stop
doing
the
selfie
line
at
this
point
they
might
not
have
any
choice
