cnn
citing
security
concerns
colorado
has
become
the
first
state
to
stop
counting
ballots
with
printed
barcodes
the
state's
secretary
of
state
told
cnn
she
felt
it
was
a
necessary
step
to
ensure
colorado
maintains
its
position
as
a
national
leader
on
election
security
the
decision
is
a
further
step
toward
prioritizing
the
role
of
human
eye
rather
than
computers
to
count
votes
in
recent
years
after
researchers
have
repeatedly
demonstrated
it's
possible
to
hack
many
voting
machines
in
particular
circumstances
and
the
us
intelligence
community
detailed
russia's
interference
in
the
election
both
government
and
industry
leaders
have
reached
a
general
consensus
that
the
us
needs
to
use
paper
ballots
so
that
elections
can
be
properly
audited

but
some
states
have
purchased
voting
machines
that
print
out
a
paper
receipt
with
either
a
qr
short
for
quick
response
or
a
more
traditional
barcode
something
a
computer
can
read
but
a
human
cannot
which
can
then
be
easily
scanned
and
tallied
to
represent
a
voter's
choices
but
those
codes
are
still
controversial
and
experts
warn
that
even
though
they're
on
paper
elections
still
need
to
be
audited
before
results
are
certified
a
voter
can
verify
the
ovals
the
candidates
they
chose
but
how
it
gets
tabulated
is
actually
through
an
encrypted
qr
code
colorado
secretary
of
state
jena
griswold
told
cnn
is
it
really
a
voter
verified
paper
trail
if
a
voter
cannot
verify
the
encrypted
qr
code
to
that
end
from
colorado
will
no
longer
certify
machines
that
count
votes
by
qr
or
barcode
under
a
pending
deal
with
dominion
the
vendor
that
currently
supplies
colorado's
voting
equipment
a
newly
engineered
software
upgrade
will
instead
print
out
ballots
with
choices
picked
marked
with
darkened
ovals
identical
to
how
a
hand-marked
ballot
would
look
dominion's
scanners
already
are
designed
to
record
hand-marked
ballots
so
no
change
is
necessary
spokeswoman
kay
stinson
said
at
hacking
conference
pentagon's
transparency
highlights
voting
companies
secrecy
the
argument
for
paper
ballots
isn't
that
they
create
a
system
that's
unhackable
that's
a
term
security
experts
take
pains
to
avoid
it's
that
using
them
to
double-check
a
count
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
confidence
that
it's
accurate
most
ballot-marking
devices
print
a
voter's
choice
twice
both
the
qr
code
or
barcode
for
computers
and
in
written
text
so
that
people
can
verify
it
in
the
hypothetical
scenario
where
that
machine
is
hacked
the
argument
against
barcode
voting
goes
a
voter
would
see
their
intended
choice
printed
out
but
that
qr
or
barcode
could
show
a
different
candidate
if
the
machine
had
been
hacked
will
other
states
follow
some
election
security
hardliners
have
called
for
every
state
to
follow
colorado
like
sen
ron
wyden
an
oregon
democrat
who's
introduced
legislation
to
make
barcode
voting
illegal
it's
great
to
see
that
colorado
is
yet
again
leading
the
nation
on
election
security
by
trashing
its
hackable
barcode
ballot-marking
machines
wyden
told
cnn
these
machines
are
a
ripe
target
for
hackers
given
the
serious
credible
threat
that
russia
and
other
governments
will
interfere
in
the
election
it
is
vital
that
all
states
follow
colorado's
example
by
prioritizing
cybersecurity
over
the
special
interest
voting
machine
lobby
wyden
said
colorado's
choice
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
georgia
which
recently
signed
a
million
contract
also
with
dominion
to
replace
its
paperless
machines
with
a
system
that
includes
qr
code
marking
devices
kentucky
official
says
counties
can't
upgrade
cybersecurity
because
they're
severely
under
resourced
not
all
election
security
experts
agree
that
qr
codes
on
ballots
are
such
a
problem
an
ideal
voting
scenario
includes
both
a
quick
automated
tally
as
well
as
a
subsequent
statistically
significant
audit
of
the
paper
ballots
the
real
concern
isn't
using
qr
codes
for
the
first
part
because
it's
still
going
to
be
converted
to
code
for
a
computer
to
tabulate
instead
it's
whether
the
vote
will
then
be
audited
something
only
a
handful
of
states
do
obviously
the
voter
will
probably
know
either
way
that
their
vote
will
be
interpreted
by
a
computer
said
voting
security
researcher
matt
bernhard
so
long
as
the
human-readable
part
of
the
paper
ballot
can
be
reviewed
by
each
voter
for
mistakes
and
a
post-election
audit
is
conducted
to
verify
the
outcome
based
on
the
paper
ballots
whether
or
not
there's
a
barcode
does
not
matter
he
said
still
colorado's
change
will
likely
influence
other
states
said
larry
norden
director
of
the
brennan
center's
election
reform
program
told
cnn
colorado
has
put
more
effort
into
election
security
and
being
at
the
forefront
than
any
other
state
rhode
island
adopted
risk-limiting
audits
and
a
bunch
of
states
are
piloting
them
because
colorado
did
this
norden
told
cnn
the
fact
that
colorado
pushed
a
vendor
to
adopt
a
ballot-marking
process
without
a
qr
code
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
other
states
start
to
follow
he
said
correction
this
story
has
been
updated
to
correctly
reflect
that
jena
griswold
is
colorado's
secretary
of
state
