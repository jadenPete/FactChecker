bolton
offers
scathing
criticism
of
trump
at
closed-door
event
attendee
says
washington
cnn
former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
didn't
offer
any
praise
of
president
donald
trump
in
remarks
at
a
private
event
wednesday
but
instead
took
aim
at
his
former
boss
policies
on
the
world
stage
according
to
an
attendee
bolton
who
trump
fired
earlier
this
month
made
comments
at
an
event
hosted
by
the
gatestone
institute
in
new
york
that
the
attendee
characterized
to
cnn
as
scathing
in
their
criticism
of
trump's
approach
to
iran
north
korea
and
afghanistan
politico
was
first
to
report
on
bolton's
remarks
bolton
didn't
have
anything
positive
to
say
about
trump
the
attendee
said
while
bolton
did
not
mention
trump
by
name
he
said
the
idea
of
inviting
the
taliban
to
camp
david
was
disrespectful
to
the
victims
of
the
september
terrorist
attacks
according
to
the
attendee
as
cnn
previously
reported
bolton
and
trump
got
into
a
heated
argument
over
the
president's
plan
to
host
the
taliban
leaders
in
the
days
before
the
th
anniversary
of
the
attacks
and
bolton
did
not
back
down
two
people
familiar
with
what
happened
said
one
senior
official
confirmed
this
argument
happened
in
the
oval
office
and
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
the
president
asked
bolton
for
his
resignation
bolton's
exit
made
him
the
latest
national
security
figure
the
trump
administration
has
plowed
through
even
as
multiple
geopolitical
crises
have
played
out
trump's
approach
to
national
security
and
his
penchant
for
threatening
other
countries
over
twitter
has
made
national
security
roles
within
the
trump
administration
increasingly
difficult
to
navigate
in
june
trump
said
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
has
kept
his
word
when
it
comes
to
nuclear
and
missile
testing
a
direct
contradiction
of
bolton
who
just
hours
earlier
had
accused
pyongyang
of
failing
to
follow
through
on
its
commitments
trump
sparked
similar
confusion
in
july
when
he
told
reporters
that
afghanistan
would
be
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
if
he
wanted
to
win
the
war
in
the
region
bolton
went
on
to
tell
the
attendees
on
wednesday
that
the
administration
believes
iran
has
been
behind
other
disruptive
drone
strikes
including
one
on
a
nato
convoy
in
afghanistan
according
to
the
attendee
in
the
room
for
the
remarks
bolton
told
the
attendees
he
believed
that
letting
these
attacks
go
unanswered
is
simply
encouraging
iran's
bad
behavior
in
wide-ranging
comments
to
reporters
in
the
oval
office
last
week
trump
held
forth
on
iran
and
afghanistan
pausing
to
criticize
bolton
for
his
positions
on
iraq
and
north
korea
and
make
clear
he
disagreed
with
his
former
adviser's
stance
on
venezuela
while
bolton
had
pushed
tough
measures
against
iran
and
north
korea
and
in
the
past
has
advocated
the
use
of
military
force
against
both
trump
praised
the
potential
of
both
countries
and
did
not
rule
out
easing
sanctions
on
tehran
a
change
the
regime
is
demanding
before
it
will
engage
in
talks
