at

denies
collusion
with
foreign
entities
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
holding
its
first
impeachment
investigation
hearing
on
tuesday
september
here
is
the
opening
statement
of
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
chairman
nadler
ranking
member
collins
members
of
the
committee
good
afternoon
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
expressing
my
hope
that
today's
hearing
will
be
productive
in
revealing
the
truth
both
to
the
committee
and
to
the
american
people
for
the
record
as
you
likely
know
i
have
already
testified
before
congress
on
three
separate
occasions
i
also
sat
at
length
with
the
staff
of
the
special
counsel's
office
there
too
my
time
and
answers
were
given
freely
and
without
hesitation
i
think
in
one
form
or
another
i
have
already
answered
questions
for
well
over
hours
so
now
here
i
am
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
answer
the
same
questions
again
just
last
week
this
committee
over
the
objections
of
the
minority
unilaterally
changed
the
rules
to
make
this
an
impeachment
proceeding
which
is
very
unfair
however
in
the
spirit
of
cooperation
i
am
prepared
to
move
forward
i'd
like
to
start
by
recounting
the
events
that
brought
us
to
this
point
my
story
of
joining
the
trump
campaign
working
through
a
historic
election
and
continuing
to
have
the
privilege
to
be
part
of
the
greatest
political
movement
in
our
nation's
history
i
present
this
summary
in
the
interest
of
truth
and
transparency
to
the
american
people
the
very
same
reason
and
rationale
that
this
committee
offers
as
the
basis
for
today's
hearing
growing
up
in
a
blue
collar
single-parent
family
in
lowell
massachusetts
i
learned
the
value
of
hard
work
that
work
ethic
helped
me
to
put
myself
through
both
college
and
graduate
school
prior
to
becoming
a
congressional
staffer
and
ultimately
a
certified
peace
officer
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
however
the
world
of
politics
was
always
a
passion
in
january
of
donald
j.
trump
then
a
private
citizen
hired
me
to
help
him
explore
a
possible
run
for
the
presidency
it
was
an
honor
and
a
privilege
to
play
a
small
part
of
such
a
historic
campaign
the
campaign
started
as
a
small
group
of
individuals
helping
mr
trump
to
make
the
decision
in
june
to
ride
down
the
golden
escalator
and
seek
the
republican
nomination
for
president
of
the
united
states
for
more
than
a
year
i
served
as
campaign
manager
to
then-candidate
trump
in
his
presidential
campaign
where
i
led
a
lean
and
dedicated
operation
that
succeeded
in
helping
him
capture
the
republican
nomination
my
job
was
simple
provide
mr
trump
with
my
best
advice
spend
his
money
like
it
was
my
own
and
give
him
the
support
he
needed
to
win
i
also
set
long-term
objectives
and
made
day-to-day
decisions
i
had
the
privilege
and
it
was
a
privilege
of
helping
transform
the
trump
campaign
from
a
dedicated
but
small
makeshift
organization
to
a
historically
and
unprecedented
political
juggernaut
i
am
proud
to
say
mr
trump
won
primaries
and
caucuses
and
received
more
votes
than
any
candidate
in
the
history
of
the
republican
party
all
while
being
outspent
most
of
the
way
the
historic
campaign
helped
mr
trump
secure
the
republican
nomination
and
ultimately
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
however
since
election
day
whether
it
was
bad
actors
at
the
fbi
and
the
intelligence
community
or
lies
coming
from
members
of
the
current
house
majority
that
there
was
evidence
of
collusion
the
american
people
continue
to
be
sold
a
false
narrative
with
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
legitimacy
of
the
election
results
no
matter
the
size
campaigns
are
not
always
the
most
efficient
of
organizations
while
you
run
in
a
single
congressional
district
just
imagine
what
it
is
like
to
lead
a
national
campaign
that
spans
all
states
of
the
union
during
my
time
as
campaign
manager
there
were
competing
interests
for
the
candidate's
time
and
a
sea
of
ideas
some
laudable
some
sound
a
few
not
so
much
many
of
which
were
dismissed
out
of
hand
others
were
passed
on
to
other
staffers
to
be
handled
i
also
received
hundreds
of
thousands
of
emails
some
days
with
as
many
as
emails
and
unlike
hillary
clinton
i
don't
think
i
ever
deleted
any
of
those
many
of
them
were
responded
to
with
either
one-word
answers
or
forwarded
to
other
staff
for
additional
follow
up
throughout
it
all
and
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
i
don't
recall
ever
having
any
conversations
with
foreign
entities
let
alone
any
who
were
offering
help
to
manipulate
the
outcome
of
the
election
as
i
have
said
publicly
many
times
anyone
who
attempted
to
illegally
impact
the
outcome
of
the
election
should
spend
the
rest
of
their
life
in
jail
and
let
me
also
stress
this
fact
during
the
campaign
cycle
mr
trump
held
no
elected
position
he
was
not
a
government
official
rather
the
obama-biden
administration
and
the
intelligence
community
overseen
by
james
clapper
jim
comey
and
john
brennan
had
the
responsibility
to
the
american
people
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
election
i
leave
it
to
this
committee
and
the
american
public
to
decide
how
successful
or
not
they
were
in
doing
their
jobs
regardless
as
the
special
counsel
determined
there
was
no
conspiracy
or
collusion
between
the
trump
campaign
and
any
foreign
government
either
on
my
watch
or
afterward
not
surprisingly
after
the
mueller
report
was
made
public
interest
in
the
fake
russian
collusion
narrative
has
fallen
apart
sadly
the
country
spent
over
three
years
and
million
taxpayer
dollars
on
these
investigations
it
is
now
clear
the
investigation
was
populated
by
many
trump
haters
who
had
their
own
agenda
to
try
and
take
down
a
duly
elected
president
of
the
united
states
as
for
actual
collusion
or
conspiracy
there
was
none
what
there
has
been
however
is
harassment
of
the
president
from
the
day
he
won
the
election
in
conclusion
this
is
a
challenging
time
in
our
country
there
are
real
issues
to
be
faced
and
real
people
that
this
body
can
help
america's
divisions
are
real
and
yet
i
am
hopeful
that
we
as
a
country
can
come
together
the
house
majority
has
failed
the
american
people
both
by
supporting
illegal
immigrants
pouring
across
our
borders
killing
innocent
americans
and
failing
to
solve
the
opioid
crisis
where
americans
die
daily
from
overdoses
that's
the
equivalent
of
a
level
tragedy
occurring
every
days
we
as
a
nation
would
be
better
served
if
elected
officials
like
you
concentrated
your
efforts
to
combat
the
true
crises
facing
our
country
as
opposed
to
going
down
rabbit
holes
like
this
hearing
if
instead
of
focusing
on
petty
and
personal
politics
the
committee
focused
on
solving
the
challenges
of
this
generation
imagine
how
many
people
we
could
help
imagine
how
many
lives
we
could
save
as
i
stated
earlier
i
have
voluntarily
appeared
in
front
of
congress
on
three
separate
occasions
and
spoken
to
members
of
the
special
counsel's
office
for
multiple
hours
i
will
continue
to
be
forthright
and
cooperative
and
i
will
be
as
sincere
in
my
answers
as
the
committee
is
in
its
questions
