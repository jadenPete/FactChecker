in
the
texas
suburbs
voters
feel
apathy
and
desire
for
a
uniter
how
to
win
the
presidential
debate
fort
worth
texas
cnn
here
in
a
well-trimmed
neighborhood
of
tarrant
county
the
mass
shootings
of
the
past
few
months
feel
unnervingly
close
for
amanda
crump
first
it
was
the
gunman
who
killed
people
at
an
el
paso
walmart
then
it
was
the
seemingly
haphazard
rampage
of
the
shooter
from
odessa
who
killed
seven
people
in
west
texas
and
injured
at
least
others
the
year-old
knows
that
the
democrats
running
for
president
have
offered
policy
prescriptions
to
assuage
the
fears
of
suburban
moms
like
herself
from
universal
background
checks
to
an
assault
weapons
ban
but
to
her
the
shootings
are
the
product
of
something
much
deeper
and
darker
with
no
easy
fix
a
culture
of
hate
in
america
that
she
says
is
being
fostered
at
the
top
when
the
democratic
candidates
debate
in
houston
thursday
night
she
won't
even
bother
to
turn
on
the
television
to
her
it
will
be
just
another
round
of
democrats
fighting
while
playing
the
blame
game
with
president
donald
trump
ever
since
trump
got
elected
i
don't
watch
the
news
anymore
because
it's
all
just
bull
she
said
with
a
note
of
resignation
as
she
picked
up
her
children
at
an
elementary
school
on
a
sunny
afternoon
this
week
six
things
to
watch
for
during
tonight's
democratic
debate
people
will
say
it's
trump's
fault
but
it's
not
said
the
independent
noting
the
slashing
tweets
and
social
media
posts
targeting
trump
from
celebrities
and
democratic
politicians
alike
she
yearns
for
a
candidate
from
either
party
who
would
bring
people
together
and
not
push
them
away
from
one
another
next
year's
presidential
election
will
be
fought
in
the
rapidly-growing
suburbs
of
places
like
tarrant
county
the
kind
of
place
where
red
precincts
that
voted
for
trump
lie
alongside
blue
ones
that
went
for
hillary
clinton
in
trump
won
here
with
nearly
of
the
vote
in
and
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
a
democrat
narrowly
beat
republican
sen
ted
cruz
two
years
later
the
key
demographic
here
will
once
again
be
women
who
have
been
notably
drifting
away
from
trump
and
the
republican
party
as
a
stay-at-home
mom
to
three
children
of
mixed
race
crump
said
the
political
debate
feels
like
a
toxic
churn
of
clashes
pitting
americans
against
one
another
why
does
one
race
discriminate
against
another
race
i
mean
it
was
a
white
guy
who
went
into
walmart
and
shot
all
those
mexicans
crump
said
referring
to
the
el
paso
shooter's
admission
to
authorities
that
he
was
targeting
mexicans
it's
just
not
right
she
pointed
to
the
children
around
her
on
the
sidewalk
look
at
these
kids
she
said
they
coexist
different
cultures
different
ethnicities
and
they're
not
fighting
they're
not
arguing
we
need
to
just
coexist
and
be
better
the
pickup
opportunity
for
democrats
nationally
is
clear
in
polling
as
trump's
approval
ratings
among
women
continue
to
slide
in
cnn's
most
recent
national
poll
only
of
women
approved
of
how
trump
is
doing
his
job
when
looking
ahead
to
his
reelection
prospects
for
about
of
white
college-educated
women
said
trump
deserved
another
term
compared
with
of
non-college-educated
women
in
clinton
beat
trump
among
women
nationally
to
according
to
exit
polls
democrats
have
a
chance
to
capitalize
on
that
drift
but
interviews
here
in
tarrant
county
suggest
that
their
messages
which
may
resonate
with
the
supercharged
activist
based
determined
to
turn
trump
out
of
office
are
not
yet
piercing
through
and
the
candidates
themselves
often
are
not
connecting
with
average
voters
who
can
break
through
while
there
is
pronounced
fatigue
with
trump's
tone
and
his
tweets
among
female
voters
the
democrats
clearly
have
a
long
way
to
go
in
persuading
average
voters
that
they'll
be
effective
in
breaking
washington's
deadlock
on
what
to
do
about
an
issue
as
complex
as
gun
violence
even
with
an
issue
that
has
been
so
top
of
mind
in
recent
weeks
voters
here
said
it
was
hard
to
see
much
difference
among
the
democratic
candidates
and
difficult
to
determine
whether
any
one
of
them
would
be
a
better
champion
even
for
widely-backed
ideas
like
universal
background
checks
with
all
of
the
conflict
around
the
trump
administration
many
voters
readily
admit
that
it's
easier
to
tune
out
the
presidential
race
than
tune
in
perhaps
because
of
that
the
pack
of
democratic
candidates
remains
something
of
an
amalgam
with
many
voters
saying
there
are
still
too
many
to
keep
track
of
surya
barrow
a
year-old
democrat
from
tarrant
county
said
she
sat
down
and
read
a
story
in
the
new
york
times
focused
on
each
candidate's
position
on
gun
control
though
that
issue
is
among
her
top
concerns
no
one
candidate
stood
out
how
to
watch
tonight's
democratic
presidential
debate
i
was
kind
of
like
well
i'm
going
to
wait
and
see
who
comes
out
of
the
primaries
she
said
in
part
that's
because
she
described
the
el
paso
shooting
as
a
complete
failure
of
the
system
that
goes
far
beyond
the
solutions
being
proposed
she
noted
for
example
that
the
mother
of
the
year-old
shooting
suspect
called
police
to
express
her
alarm
about
her
son
owning
an
ak
style
firearm
we
have
a
major
problem
there
is
this
whole
thing
about
terror
and
anger
and
darkness
that
is
coming
out
of
america's
youth
barrow
said
then
there's
this
whole
other
story
about
mental
illness
that's
not
being
told
i'm
interested
in
the
whole
narrative
but
of
course
i'm
a
mama
my
kids
go
to
public
schools
as
far
as
the
presidential
race
barrow
said
she
will
wait
to
support
for
the
person
who
actually
has
the
best
chance
of
winning
maybe
that's
not
entirely
in
alignment
with
every
single
value
i
hold
but
i'm
not
interested
in
making
a
statement
with
some
far-runner
when
i
see
so
many
people
hurting
at
the
most
basic
level
she
said
she
wants
to
see
compassion
coming
from
the
white
house
and
a
basic
concern
for
humanity
susan
wood
a
year-old
former
special
education
teacher
from
granbury
texas
gives
o'rourke
high
marks
for
showing
that
kind
of
compassion
and
humanity
since
the
shootings
o'rourke
paused
his
campaign
for
nearly
two
weeks
after
the
massacre
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
wood
still
has
o'rourke's
senate
campaign
bumper
sticker
on
her
car
along
with
a
sticker
bearing
a
quote
from
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
if
you
don't
have
a
seat
at
the
table
you're
probably
on
the
menu
but
in
the
presidential
race
wood
says
she's
leaning
toward
warren
or
california
sen
kamala
harris
o'rourke
she
said
needs
to
cook
a
little
longer
before
aiming
for
the
white
house
she's
not
yet
convinced
that
either
harris
or
warren
will
be
able
to
galvanize
the
broader
electorate
in
a
way
that
gives
her
confidence
about
their
ability
to
beat
trump
though
the
choice
is
about
who
can
get
people
excited
about
them
wood
said
for
me
that's
the
way
i
felt
about
beto
i
was
excited
about
him
i
wanted
to
listen
to
him
and
i
thought
he
was
smart
and
brilliant
and
honest
and
genuine
they
need
to
be
able
to
excite
everybody
wood
said
if
they
could
excite
millennials
the
way
bernie
sanders
excited
millenials
if
they
could
excite
the
minority
vote
the
way
beto
excited
the
minority
vote
and
if
they
could
excite
women
the
way
clinton
excited
women
i
haven't
seen
anybody
who
can
do
all
that
yet
ruth
cress
a
year-old
medical
coordinator
from
fort
worth
said
that
as
horrifying
as
the
recent
shootings
were
she
too
is
waiting
to
hear
bigger
ideas
i
just
haven't
heard
a
fix
for
it
yet
she
said
i'm
not
an
nra
advocate
but
there
are
people
behind
the
guns
i
don't
know
what
the
fix
is
for
that
cress
cannot
stand
trump
but
no
one
democrat
has
caught
her
attention
i
get
tired
of
hearing
all
that
bickering
she
said
they're
all
just
like
little
kids
arguing
back
and
forth
that's
what
it
sounds
like
to
me
when
it
narrows
down
to
where
there's
a
handful
then
i'll
start
paying
attention
