county
district
attorney
cyrus
vance's
office
has
subpoenaed
eight
years
of
president
donald
trump's
tax
returns
from
mazars
usa
the
longtime
accounting
firm
to
trump
and
the
trump
organization
as
part
of
its
investigation
into
hush
money
payments
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
the
subpoena
marks
a
new
escalation
in
the
large-scale
effort
to
obtain
the
president's
tax
returns
a
battle
that
has
largely
played
out
in
courts
as
the
trump
administration
has
continued
to
stand
its
ground
against
efforts
to
secure
any
of
trump's
financial
information
trump
has
claimed
that
ongoing
irs
audits
have
stopped
him
from
making
his
tax
returns
public
even
though
audits
don't
prevent
individuals
from
releasing
tax
returns
vance's
office
declined
to
comment
the
subpoena
was
first
reported
by
the
new
york
times
it
isn't
clear
what
deadline
mazars
usa
has
to
comply
with
the
grand
jury
subpoena
the
firm
said
it
would
comply
with
legal
requests
mazars
usa
will
respect
the
legal
process
and
fully
comply
with
its
legal
obligations
the
company
said
in
a
statement
we
believe
strongly
in
the
ethical
and
professional
rules
and
regulations
that
govern
our
industry
our
work
and
our
client
interactions
as
a
matter
of
firm
policy
and
professional
rules
we
do
not
comment
on
the
work
we
conduct
for
our
clients
any
material
obtained
by
a
grand
jury
subpoena
is
covered
by
grand
jury
secrecy
rules
and
would
likely
become
public
only
if
it
were
used
as
evidence
at
a
trial
marc
mukasey
a
lawyer
for
the
trump
organization
said
we
are
evaluating
and
will
respond
as
appropriate
trump
and
the
trump
organization
reimbursed
his
former
personal
lawyer
michael
cohen
for
a
payment
he
made
to
adult
film
actress
stormy
daniels
to
keep
her
from
going
public
with
her
allegation
of
an
affair
with
trump
before
the
election
trump
has
denied
the
affair
prosecutors
are
looking
into
whether
the
trump
organization
filed
any
false
business
records
in
how
it
accounted
for
the
reimbursement
of
the
payments
to
cohen
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
told
cnn
last
month
after
the
manhattan
da's
office
sent
subpoenas
to
the
trump
organization
and
american
media
inc
those
subpoenas
sought
communications
between
the
company
and
representatives
for
daniels
and
karen
mcdougal
who
also
alleged
to
have
an
affair
with
trump
more
than
a
decade
ago
congressional
democrats
have
long
argued
that
the
release
of
trump's
personal
financial
information
is
an
important
step
in
establishing
any
potential
conflicts
of
interests
involving
the
trump
organization
and
details
about
trump's
financial
worth
last
month
a
federal
judge
denied
an
attempt
by
house
democrats
to
fast-track
its
attempt
to
force
the
treasury
department
and
irs
to
release
trump's
tax
returns
