us
veterans
current
service
members
and
their
families
are
being
targeted
online
with
malware
and
by
foreign
entities
and
influence
campaigns
and
the
government
isn't
doing
enough
to
stop
it
a
new
report
says
the
study
by
vietnam
veterans
of
america
a
non-profit
that
advocates
for
and
serves
the
needs
of
all
veterans
documents
a
myriad
number
of
ways
veterans
are
impersonated
and
targeted
online
particularly
on
facebook
in
at
least
one
instance
they've
been
targeted
by
influence
campaigns
from
foreign
governments
russia's

agency
for

the
troll
factory
with
ties
to
the
russian
government
that
creates
content
to
push
divisive
messages
on
american
social
media
purchased
more
than
a
hundred
online
ads
targeting
us
service
members
and
veterans
the
study
found
it
also
specifically
purchased
ads
focused
on
people
who
followed
a
number
of
legitimate
organizations
on
facebook
including
vietnam
veterans
of
america
iraq
and
afghanistan
veterans
of
america
and
concerned
veterans
for
america
but
the
sources
of
the
efforts
to
target
veterans
was
not
always
clear
the
report
found
numerous
other
facebook
pages
and
groups
often
with
moderators
who
were
listed
in
countries
like
russia
though
not
necessarily
tied
to
the
ira
and
with
concentrations
in
eastern
europe
and
vietnam
that
follow
very
similar
trends
one
facebook
page
called
vietnam
veterans
which
has
been
around
since
at
least
posted
both
photos
of
vva's
president
to
imply
a
relation
with
the
group
and
re-posted
russian
ira
memes
another
the
since-deleted
vietnam
vets
of
america
mimicked
the
vva
logo
a
legitimate
organization
with
its
own
facebook
page
and
frequently
posted
links
to
a
now-defunct
inflammatory
news
blog
called
vvets
eu
another
page
we
are
veterans
which
was
created
in
mimics
a
legitimate
page
called
we
honor
veterans
an
extension
of
a
group
in
alexandria
virginia
that

all
nine

for

are
listed
as
coming
from

in
addition
to
also
posting
both
ira-created
and
pro-trump
memes
the
page
has
at
times
offered
military-themed
memorabilia
for

some
of
those
targeted

they

from

conflict

highlighted
how
conventional
warfare
mixed
with
cyber-attacks
can
have
deadly
consequences
the
unfortunate
reality
is
that
bad
actors
exploiting
facebook's
openness
and
reach
have
used
this
american-bred
company
to
spread
disinformation
sow
division
and
undermine
our
very
own
democracy
sen
mark
warner
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
told
cnn
and
they've
done
this
in
part
by
zeroing
in
on
service
members
and
veterans
facebook
periodically
announces
it
has
proactively
taken
down
what
it
describes
as
coordinated
inauthentic
behavior
some
of
those
fall
into
the
category
of
influence
campaigns
which
usually
benefit
a
particular
country's
government
but
facebook
isn't
aware
of
all
its
users
intentions
and
tips
from
some
past
takedowns
have
originated
with
other
tech
companies
or

more
than

originating
from
at
least
different
countries

its

in
a
statement
spokeswoman
jennifer
martinez
said
this
report
describes
several
instances
of
veterans
being
targeted
on
social
media
we
take
these
issues
seriously
and
will
continue
to
work
with
the
veterans
community
to
address
their
concerns
in
at
least
one
known
instance
according
to
the

the

taken
direct

blocked

unclear
who
should
play
defense
but
it's
less
clear
who's
supposed
to
play
defense
the
study's
author
vva
researcher
kris
goldsmith
told
cnn
he
doesn't
solely
put
the
blame
on
the
tech
platforms
they
highlighted
including
facebook
and
wants
the
government
to
take
a
proactive
role
in
protecting
veterans
from
influence
operations
and
scams
the
fact
that
it's
on
facebook
makes
it
look
to
members
of
congress
right
now
as
if
like
it's
all
facebook's
fault
goldsmith
said
in
our
view
facebook's
an
american
asset
one
of
the
most
important
american
companies
to
ever
exist
one
that
can
be
a
force
for
good
to
spread
democracy
around
the
world
and
our
adversaries
have
turned
it
against
us
the
departments
of
defense
and
veterans
affairs
for
instance
should
coordinate
federal
efforts
to
protect
servicemembers
and
veterans
from
deceptive
foreign-generated
online
content
he
wrote
in
the
study
but
the
agencies
have
not
responded
to
him
in
a
statement
to
cnn
pentagon
spokeswoman
heather
babb
said
current
personnel
must
undergo
annual
cyber
security
training
as
part
of
this
training
personnel
learn
about
the
potential
dangers
of
social
media
phishing
and
other
cyber
threats
as
well
as
measures
they
can
take
to
protect
themselves
veterans
affairs
spokesman
randal
noller
told
cnn
that
veterans
are
the
targets
of
many
of
the
same
types
of
fraud
as
the
rest
of
society
including
mail
telephone
and
online
fraud

appreciates
this
