takeaways
from
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
houston
texas
cnn
pete
buttigieg
called
it
unwatchable
amy
klobuchar
warned
that
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
juli
n
castro
said
what
was
unfolding
on
stage
was
called
an
election
democrats
met
for
their
third
debate
of
the
presidential
primary
thursday
night
in
houston
with
the
field
narrowed
to
just
candidates
who
qualified
for
the
stage
it
was
messy
and
at
times
nasty
the
night
featured
castro
launching
a
series
of
risky
attacks
on
the
front-runner
in
national
polls
former
vice
president
joe
biden
it
saw
fellow
texan
beto
o'rourke
have
his
best
moments
yet
on
home-state
turf
and
it
offered
another
gauge
of
how
the
party's
raging
debate
over
health
care
is
evolving
with
biden
leading
the
centrist
candidates
in
fighting
back
more
forcefully
against
medicare
for
all
buttigieg
the
south
bend
indiana
mayor
tried
at
one
point
to
pull
democrats
out
of
the
mud
this
is
why
presidential
debates
are
becoming
unwatchable
because
this
reminds
everybody
of
what
they
cannot
stand
about
washington
scoring
points
against
each
other
poking
at
each
other
and
telling
each
other
that
my
plan
your
plan
he
said
that's
when
castro
the
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
and
the
chief
instigator
thursday
night
interjected
yeah
that's
called
the
democratic
primary
election
pete
that's
called
an
election
that's
an
election
you
know
he
said
this
is
what
we're
here
for
it's
an
election
here
are
seven
takeaways
from
the
third
democratic
debate
castro's
launches
an
attack
on
biden
juli
n
castro
takes
jab
at
joe
biden's
memory
much
of
the
pre-debate
hype
focused
on
the
potential
for
an
ideological
clash
between
biden
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
who
were
sharing
the
stage
for
the
first
time
but
it
was
castro
a
member
of
former
president
barack
obama's
cabinet
who
came
ready
to
brawl
with
party's
front-runner
criticizing
obama
over
deportations
castro
said
of
biden
he
wants
to
get
credit
for
obama's
work
but
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
i
stand
with
barack
obama
all
eight
years
good
bad
and
indifferent
that's
where
i
stand
biden
responded
the
back-and-forth
raised
questions
about
what
obama's
legacy
really
is
and
how
democratic
voters
want
to
see
it
furthered
do
they
want
to
elevate
his
loyal
vice
president
or
are
they
looking
for
what
obama
once
was
a
young
inspirational
candidate
to
lead
them
into
the
future
it's
not
clear
that
castro
qualifies
as
the
latter
his
attacks
on
biden
perhaps
weakened
biden
but
also
risked
alienating
democratic
voters
who
largely
like
all
their
leading
candidates
including
the
former
vice
president
the
most
stunning
of
their
exchanges
was
the
first
one
when
castro
launched
a
very-thinly-veiled
assault
over
a
topic
other
democrats
have
only
gingerly
broached
biden's
age
he
accused
the
former
vice
president
of
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
during
an
exchange
over
whether
biden's
health
care
plan
would
require
americans
who
want
to
sign
up
for
his
medicare-style
public
option
would
have
to
buy
into
it
then
he
tried
to
twist
the
knife
saying
i'm
fulfilling
the
legacy
of
barack
obama
and
you
are
not
castro
told
cnn's
chris
cuomo
after
the
debate
that
the
comment
was
not
intended
as
a
personal
attack
or
affront
this
is
a
debate
and
when
we're
talking
about
health
care
policy
we're
talking
about
a
policy
that
impacts
every
single
person
in
this
country
castro
said
on
cnn
after
the
debate
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
implied
castro
had
taken
a
cheap
shot
and
said
that
tone
and
tenor
are
important
even
as
he
also
insisted
castro's
attacks
reflected
broader
concerns
about
biden
i
think
that
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there's
a
lot
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
and
i
think
that
castro
had
some
really
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
who
can
get
the
ball
over
the
line
and
he
has
every
right
to
call
that
out
booker
said
there's
another
possibility
to
consider
castro
has
been
a
contender
for
the
democratic
vice
presidential
nomination
before
if
another
candidate
on
stage
thursday
night
other
than
biden
wins
the
nomination
and
is
looking
for
an
attack
dog
for
a
running
mate
castro
gave
them
something
to
think
about
biden
vs
warren
and
sanders
on
health
care
democrats
differences
on
how
to
achieve
universal
health
coverage
has
dominated
the
opening
portions
of
all
three
debates
the
only
difference
thursday
night
was
that
all
the
leading
candidates
were
on
stage
biden
was
quick
to
criticize
warren
who
supports
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
medicare
for
all
plan
in
which
private
insurance
would
effectively
be
ended
and
all
americans
would
be
enrolled
in
a
government
program
instead
biden
said
he
is
offering
a
more
modest
proposal
that
builds
on
obamacare
by
giving
americans
the
option
to
buy
into
a
medicare-style
program
but
doesn't
require
it
i
know
the
senator
says
she
is
for
bernie
biden
said
well
i
am
for
barack
warren
attempted
to
defuse
biden's
approach
by
praising
the
former
president
we
all
owe
a
huge
debt
to
president
obama
who
fundamentally
transformed
health
care
in
america
and
committed
this
country
to
health
care
for
every
human
being
she
said
debates
confirm
there
is
really
only
one
issue
in
the
democratic
primary
the
former
vice
president
went
on
offense
pressing
sanders
and
warren
on
how
they
would
foot
the
year
trillion
bill
for
their
proposal
sanders
reminded
viewers
that
he
wrote
the
damn
bill
which
is
notable
because
health
care
is
the
rare
issue
on
which
warren
does
not
have
her
own
plan
she
backs
sanders
medicare
for
all
proposal
and
he
argued
it's
the
most
cost-effective
approach
to
providing
health
care
to
everyone
in
the
country
warren
ducked
a
question
on
whether
she
would
raise
middle-class
taxes
to
pay
for
medicare
for
all
and
the
way
she
framed
her
non-answer
focusing
on
the
overall
cost
of
health
care
rather
than
whether
it's
paid
via
income
taxes
or
deductibles
and
co-pays
showed
how
she
could
make
her
case
in
a
general
election
the
richest
individuals
and
the
biggest
corporations
are
going
to
pay
more
and
middle-class
families
are
going
to
pay
less
that's
how
this
is
going
to
work
she
said
the
centrists
fight
back
biden
got
some
back-up
on
health
care
thursday
night
from
his
fellow
moderates
in
the
race
most
pointedly
buttigieg
and
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
while
bernie
wrote
the
bill
i
read
the
bill
klobuchar
said
and
on
page
on
page
of
the
bill
it
says
that
we
will
no
longer
have
private
insurance
as
we
know
it
and
that
means
that
million
americans
will
no
longer
be
able
to
have
their
current
insurance
the
problem
sen
sanders
with
that
damn
bill
that
you
wrote
and
that
sen
warren
backs
is
that
it
doesn't
trust
the
american
people
buttigieg
said
turning
to
the
audience
he
said
i
trust
you
to
choose
what
makes
the
most
sense
for
you
not
my
way
or
the
highway
it
was
a
notable
shift
in
the
tenor
of
a
health
care
debate
that
had
to
this
point
in
the
race
largely
been
dominated
by
the
progressive
candidates
in
the
first
debate
liberal
agitators
like
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
were
there
to
pounce
against
candidates
who
were
not
eager
to
eliminate
private
insurance
and
in
the
second
debate
warren
and
sanders
stood
side-by-side
and
batted
away
criticism
from
candidates
who
didn't
qualify
for
the
third
debate
beto
breaks
out
beto
o'rourke
hell
yes
we'll
take
your
ar-
in
front
of
a
home-state
crowd
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
finally
had
the
kind
of
night
that
showed
why
he'd
once
been
seen
as
a
phenom
his
biggest
moment
came
when
he
forcefully
argued
for
the
mandatory
buyback
of
assault-style
firearms
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
he
said
o'rourke's
comment
positioned
him
as
a
leader
in
the
party's
push
for
gun
control
to
the
chagrin
of
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
who
had
advanced
a
similar
proposal
earlier
that's
right
where
o'rourke
wants
to
be
in
the
wake
of
the
early
august
mass
shooting
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
that
he
has
said
changed
him
as
a
candidate
and
it
was
teed
up
by
other
democrats
including
biden
california
sen
kamala
harris
and
castro
who
praised
him
for
how
he'd
returned
home
to
try
to
help
el
paso
heal
another
big
moment
for
o'rourke
came
at
the
end
of
a
riff
on
racism
when
he
said
of
trump
we
have
a
white
supremacist
in
the
white
house
and
he
poses
a
mortal
threat
to
people
of
color
across
this
country
o'rourke's
campaign
was
ready
for
a
spike
in
google
searches
and
social
media
traffic
that
followed
his
website
was
overhauled
to
feature
a
menacing
red
image
of
trump
with
the
words
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
a
white
supremacist
as
well
as
lots
of
links
to
trump's
racist
comments
harris
shifts
her
focus
in
the
first
debate
it
was
harris
who
had
been
biden's
chief
tormenter
earning
her
a
surge
up
the
polls
that
wound
up
fizzling
in
july
and
august
so
she
tried
a
new
approach
thursday
night
instead
taking
aim
at
trump
she
dedicated
her
entire
opening
statement
to
trump
addressing
him
directly
as
if
he
was
watchin
which
was
unlikely
given
his
speaking
engagement
in
baltimore
before
closing
by
saying
and
now
president
trump
you
can
go
back
to
watching
fox
news
explaining
her
shift
in
strategy
to
cnn
after
the
debate
harris
said
my
whole
campaign
is
about
that
and
that's
why
i'm
running
to
unseat
him
listen
i
believe
that
there
is
one
common
goal
that
we
all
have
that
we
need
to
focus
on
and
frankly
when
we
think
about
this
discussion
among
democrats
everyone
i
think
should
be
really
clear
about
pointing
out
of
course
where
we
disagree
but
the
ultimate
goal
has
to
be
to
understand
that
we
need
a
president
united
states
who
understands
that
we
need
to
bring
people
together
she
said
she
tried
to
be
a
unifying
voice
during
the
health
care
debate
let's
talk
about
the
fact
that
donald
trump
came
into
office
and
spent
almost
the
entire
first
year
of
his
term
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
affordable
care
act
she
said
she
also
praised
the
architects
of
obamacare
which
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
moderate
candidates
plans
and
medicare
for
all
i
want
to
give
credit
first
to
barack
obama
for
really
bringing
us
this
far
she
said
then
added
i
want
to
give
credit
to
bernie
take
credit
bernie
buttigieg's
setback
near
the
end
of
the
debate
abc
moderators
asked
the
candidates
an
unusual
question
what
had
been
their
most
significant
professional
setback
it
opened
the
door
for
buttigieg
who
is
gay
to
remind
viewers
of
the
historic
nature
of
his
candidacy
and
what
he
has
overcome
to
get
into
the
upper
tiers
of
democratic
presidential
candidates
as
a
military
officer
serving
under
don't
ask
don't
tell
and
as
an
elected
official
in
the
state
of
indiana
when
mike
pence
was
governor
he
said
at
a
certain
point
when
it
came
to
professional
setbacks
i
had
to
wondering
whether
just
acknowledging
who
i
was
going
to
be
the
ultimate
career-ending
professional
setback
they've
got
jokes
democrats
tried
to
be
funny
sometimes
they
failed
like
when
klobuchar
referring
to
trump
went
for
the
too-obvious
houston
we
have
a
problem
or
when
harris
needled
biden
over
his
resistance
to
executive
orders
on
guns
by
saying
instead
of
saying
no
we
can't
let's
say
yes
we
can
entrepreneur
andrew
yang
went
with
a
stereotype
i
am
asian
so
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
he
said
others
deserved
a
little
bit
of
a
chuckle
the
bald
booker
for
example
said
of
the
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
i'm
the
only
person
on
this
stage
that
finds
trudeau's
hair
menacing
harris
meanwhile
said
of
trump
that
on
trade
policy
he
reminds
me
of
that
guy
in
the
wizard
of
oz
when
you
pull
back
the
curtain
it's
a
really
small
dude
the
vegan
booker
who
doesn't
have
children
but
is
the
campaign's
most
frequent
teller
of
dad
jokes
was
asked
whether
iowans
and
texans
should
follow
his
example
first
of
all
i
want
to
say
no
i
want
to
translate
that
into
spanish
no
he
said
