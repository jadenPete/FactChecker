cnn
twitter
has
removed
a
texas
state

post
that
was
seen

a
threat
to
presidential

beto
rourke
for
his
comments
about
his
plan
for
a
mandatory
gun
buyback
program
during
thursday's
democratic
debate
during

a
proposal
he
backed
in
the
wake
of
a
mass

tweeted
at
the
texas
democrat
thursday
night
using
his
birth
name
my
ar
is
ready
for
you
robert
francis
this
is
a
death
threat
representative
clearly
you
shouldn't
own
an
ar-
and
neither
should
anyone
else
o'rourke
replied
on

cain
wrote
back
you're
a
child
robert
francis
o'rourke's
press
secretary
aleigha
cavalier
told
cnn
we
are
reporting
to
fbi
cain's
tweet
was
live
on
the
social
media
platform
for
more
than
two
hours
before
it
was
pulled
down
from
twitter
on
thursday
a
twitter
spokesperson
told
cnn
cain's
tweet
was
removed
because
it
violated
the
company's
rules
against
violence
and
wishing
harm
against
others
twitter's
rules
on
safety
specifically
states
you
may
not
threaten
violence
against
an
individual
or
a
group
of
people
cain
accused
o'rourke
friday
of
spinning
his
tweet
into
a
death
threat
he
told
cnn
his
words
were
not
a
true
threat
at
all
but
a
reflection
of
the
popular
texas
saying
come
and
take
it
what
this
really
shows
is
how
how
dangerous
some
of
this
is
that
people
want
to
try
and
spin
somebody's
words
in
order
to
try
and
take
their
guns
away
he
told
cnn
and
beto
o'rourke
knew
that
he
knew
exactly
what
it
was
and
he
seized
the
day
to
try
and
make
some
news
o'rourke
said
friday
that
his
campaign
had
contacted
the
fbi
and
twitter
about
cain's
tweet
he
applauded
twitter
for
taking
down
the
post
anytime
you
have
somebody
threatening
use
of
violence
against
somebody
in
this
country
to
resolve
a
political
issue
or
really
for
any
reason
that's
a
matter
for
law
enforcement
o'rourke
said
friday
on
cnn's
new
day
but
it
really
drives
home
the
point
better
than
i
could
have
made
representative
briscoe
cain
is
making
the
case
that
no
one
should
have
an
ar-
that
they
can
hold
over
someone
else
in
this
country
say
look
if
we
disagree
on
something
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
ar-
absolutely
wrong
o'rourke
had
told
cnn
earlier
friday
that
cain's
tweet
was
a
really
irresponsible
thing
for
him
to
do
especially
somebody
who
is
a
public
servant
and
in
a
position
of
public
trust
cnn
has
reached
out
to
the
us
secret
service
along
with
texas
authorities
the
fbi
declined
to
comment
on
the
tweets
cain
told
cnn
on
friday
that
the
fbi
has
not
reached
out
to
him
he
quipped
he
has
a
feeling
that
his
tweet
along
with
o'rourke's
response
will
work
out
for
both
of
our
bases
