trump
again
dangles
a
promise
of
tax
cuts
trump
considering
payroll
tax
cuts
amid
recession
fears
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
is
reviving
last
year's
promise
to
slash
taxes
for
america's
middle
class
as
he
seeks
to
bolster
his
reelection
bid
against
democratic
pledges
to
help
people
suffering
under
piles
of
student
loan
debt
and
wrestling
to
pay
oversized
medical
bills
speaking
in
baltimore
on
thursday
night
trump
promised
yet
again
his
administration
would
announce
new
tax
cuts
next
year
claiming
they
would
be
very
very
substantial
without
offering
any
more
details
we're
working
on
a
tax
cut
for
the
middle-income
people
that
is
going
to
be
very
very
inspirational
said
trump
who
took
the
stage
at
the
exact
time
democratic
presidential
candidates
were
lining
up
in
houston
for
their
third
debate
it's
going
to
be
something
that
i
think
everyone
is
looking
for
the
fresh
commitment
by
the
president
was
reminiscent
of
a
pledge
he
made
last
october
ahead
of
the
midterm
elections
when
he
announced
a
mysterious
last-minute
middle-class
tax
that
puzzled
white
house
officials
congressional
leaders
and
tax
wonks
in
washington
top
aides
have
echoed
the
message
while
making
clear
there's
no
agreement
on
a
plan
we
are
going
to
go
through
with
what
i
call
tax
cuts
and
i
say
that
because
i
spoke
with
the
president
at
some
length
about
this
idea
national
economic
council
director
larry
kudlow
said
friday
we
will
gather
together
the
best
ideas
from
the
hill
and
the
administration
and
outside
folks
to
provide
a
significant
new
round
of
middle-class
tax
relief
this
is
not
a
recession
measure
at
all
because
i
think
the
economy
is
very
strong
probably
might
put
something
out
sometime
maybe
the
middle
of
next
year
that
kind
of
thing
so
tax
cuts
is
where
we're
headed
those
comments
came
after
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
thursday
that
the
white
house
was
looking
into
rolling
out
a
so-called
tax
cuts
plan
at
the
beginning
of
next
year
that
would
aim
to
spur
economic
growth
through
potential
tax
cuts
and
incentives
for
small-
and
medium-sized
businesses
and
help
for
the
middle
class
as
part
of
the
package
unlike
his
competition
the
president
wants
to
grow
the
economy
and
make
sure
that
we
have
tax
cuts
for
the
middle
class
and
that
they
benefit
mnuchin
said
in
an
interview
on
cnbc
on
thursday
a
day
after
officials
had
met
in
the
oval
office
to
discuss
various
tax
proposals
as
fears
mount
that
trump's
reelection
campaign
could
be
upended
by
a
possible
economic
downturn
democrats
vying
for
trump's
job
are
proposing
major
new
government
spending
programs
largely
funded
by
tax
increases
on
the
rich
their
proposals
have
ranged
from
repealing
the
tax
law
to
undoing
the
cuts
for
the
wealthiest
to
removing
certain
provisions
that
benefit
corporations
since
august
the
trump
administration
has
been
wrestling
with
how
to
recession-proof
the
us
economy
swinging
from
one
idea
to
the
next
even
as
it
has
brushed
off
any
fears
of
a
looming
recession
that
may
be
ill
timed
as
voters
head
to
the
polls
in
november
senior
white
house
officials
have
looked
at
a
range
of
proposals
to
keep
the
us
economy
moving
everything
from
giving
workers
a
pay
bump
by
cutting
payroll
taxes
to
cutting
capital
gains
taxes
for
investors
but
officials
have
put
those
proposals
on
hold
for
the
time
being
since
they
would
face
the
political
risks
of
deploying
yet
another
tax
break
that
would
benefit
the
wealthy
a
regular
talking
point
democrats
use
when
it
comes
to
trump's
tax
law
the
discussions
inside
the
administration
come
as
the
budget
deficit
has
ballooned
past
trillion
driven
partly
by
the
tax
cuts
trump
signed
into
law
instead
the
president's
strategy
appears
for
now
to
be
focused
on
steps
the
administration
can
take
that
would
benefit
average
working
americans
a
fresh
push
for
final
passage
of
the
new
north
american
free
trade
agreement
and
more
pressure
on
the
federal
reserve
to
cut
interest
rates
trump
has
sought
to
downplay
the
risk
of
a
recession
while
pinning
blame
for
a
potential
downturn
on
the
fed
this
week
he
called
on
the
central
bank
an
institution
independent
from
the
white
house
to
cut
interest
rates
to
zero
or
even
drift
into
negative
territory
that's
much
more
than
the
white
house
had
asked
the
fed
to
do
a
few
weeks
earlier
in
calling
for
at
least
a
basis
point
cut
over
a
period
of
time
the
president
has
repeatedly
chastised
the
fed
accusing
it
of
weakening
us
competitiveness
by
not
lowering
interest
rates
faster
and
going
so
far
as
to
call
officials
boneheads
the
usa
should
always
be
paying
the
lowest
rate
he
tweeted
on
wednesday
while
criticizing
his
own
chairman
jerome
powell
it
is
only
the
naivet
of
jay
powell
and
the
federal
reserve
that
doesn't
allow
us
to
do
what
other
countries
are
already
doing
the
us
economy
appears
at
least
for
now
to
be
chugging
along
with
growth
at
wages
for
workers
have
grown
unemployment
remains
at
a
historic
year
low
and
consumers
are
still
spending
at
a
good
clip
at
their
favorite
retailers
concerns
about
a
slowdown
and
an
eventual
general
recession
have
increased
since
the
beginning
of
august
as
the
chances
of
a
trade
deal
with
china
have
ebbed
and
flowed
several
major
countries
have
reported
poor
growth
with
germany's
economy
contracting
slightly
several
market
indicators
are
blinking
red
with
the
yield
curve
on
us
bonds
briefly
inverting
last
week
for
the
first
time
since
the
prerecession
year
of
central
bankers
are
set
to
meet
next
wednesday
and
have
signaled
they
may
cut
rates
again
to
help
bolster
the
economy
from
headwinds
caused
by
the
trump
administration's
erratic
trade
policy
