lewandowski
refused
to
answer
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump's
former
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
antagonized
democrats
and
stonewalled
their
questions
about
obstruction
of
justice
during
the
first
official
impeachment-related
hearing
on
capitol
hill
in
the
wake
of
the
russia
investigation
the
roughly
six-hour
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
on
tuesday
was
so
contentious
and
yielded
so
little
information
that
the
panel's
democratic
chairman
rep
jerry
nadler
threatened
to
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
lewandowski
appeared
under
subpoena
but
refused
to
answer
dozens
of
key
questions
democrats
hoped
the
televised
hearing
would
refocus
public
attention
on
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
which
revealed
evidence
that
trump
obstructed
justice
during
his
first
year
in
office
instead
the
hearing
rapidly
deteriorated
into
partisan
bickering
as
participants
hurled
insults
in
almost
every
direction
and
tangled
over
parliamentary
procedure
but
between
the
barbs
partisan
attacks
and
references
to
lewindowski's
possible
new
hampshire
us
senate
campaign
the
former
trump
staffer
occasionally
disclosed
new
details
about
his
role
in
an
incident
that
mueller
examined
for
potential
obstruction
he
confirmed
that
trump
told
him
to
order
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
curtail
the
mueller
investigation
so
that
it
would
only
look
for
future
election
meddling
and
stop
probing
his
campaign
jeff
and
i
are
friends
socially
and
i
wanted
to
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
meal
with
jeff
and
relay
the
conversation
about
limiting
the
mueller
probe
lewandowski
said
about
his
attempts
to
convey
trump's
message
privately
to
sessions
away
from
his
justice
department
office
the
mueller
report
said
lewandowski
didn't
meet
sessions
and
didn't
carry
out
trump's
orders
but
prosecutors
analyzed
trump's
involvement
and
concluded
there
was
substantial
evidence
that
his
actions
met
the
legal
threshold
for
obstruction
of
justice
mueller
declined
to
decide
whether
trump
should
face
charges
and
sitting
presidents
are
shielded
from
prosecution
recent
efforts
by
house
democrats
to
push
forward
with
their
own
investigation
of
trump's
potential
obstruction
have
largely
been
stymied
by
white
house
claims
of
executive
privilege
uncooperative
witnesses
who
still
support
trump
and
lawsuits
that
are
bogged
down
in
court
corey
lewandowski
is
trolling
to
please
donald
trump
tuesday's
hearing
offered
little
progress
on
any
of
those
fronts
and
was
bitterly
divided
from
the
start
nadler
a
new
york
democrat
accused
the
white
house
of
orchestrating
an
absolute
cover-up
by
blocking
some
witnesses
from
appearing
at
the
public
session
and
trying
to
restrict
lewandowski's
testimony
based
on
crony
privilege
mr
lewandowski
your
behavior
in
this
hearing
room
has
been
completely
unacceptable
and
it
is
part
of
a
pattern
by
a
white
house
desperate
for
the
american
people
not
to
hear
the
truth
nadler
said
adding
that
contempt
proceedings
against
him
were
certainly
under
consideration
after
the
hearing
nadler
told
cnn
that
the
hearing
adds
more
weight
for
impeachment
harkening
back
to
efforts
to
impeach
richard
nixon
nixon
resigned
before
he
was
impeached
article
of
nixon's
impeachment
was
obstruction
of
congress
refusing
to
obey
defined
congressional
subpoenas
pleading
imaginary
privilege
nadler
said
and
obviously
that's
what
the
president
has
been
doing
nixon
wasn't
foolish
to
say
in
advance
that
he's
going
to
defy
all
congressional
subpoenas
and
today
we
saw
a
witness
instructed
by
the
white
house
completely
contemptuous
of
congress
who
refused
to
answer
relevant
questions
just
another
instance
of
obstruction
of
congress
and
that's
what
article
of
the
nixon
impeachment
was
lewandowski
used
his
opening
statement
to
attack
democratic
members
of
the
committee
criticize
obama-era
intelligence
officials
for
not
doing
enough
to
stop
russian
meddling
and
stoke
conspiracies
about
trump
haters
in
the
government
that
wanted
to
bring
down
trump
he
even
took
a
jab
at
former
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton
about
her
email
controversy
trump
who
watched
parts
of
the
hearing
aboard
air
force
one
cheered
on
his
former
aide
in
a
tweet
saying
such
a
beautiful
opening
statement
by
corey
lewandowski
thank
you
corey
few
new
details
on
obstruction
mueller
investigated
episodes
involving
trump
for
potential
obstruction
of
justice
and
the
incident
with
lewandowski
was
one
of
those
episodes
in
the
report
prosecutors
analyzed
whether
each
incident
checked
the
three
boxes
needed
to
typically
bring
an
obstruction
charge
some
of
the
incidents
did
not
meet
the
threshold
and
others
were
a
close
call
prosecutors
determined
trump's
actions
with
lewandowski
checked
all
three
boxes
for
obstruction
it
was
a
distinct
obstructive
act
that
would
hamper
the
investigation
the
action
was
directly
linked
to
an
ongoing
criminal
probe
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
of
trump's
obstructive
intent
lewandowski
said
under
oath
tuesday
that
mueller's
report
was
an
accurate
representation
of
his
conversations
with
trump
in
summer
when
trump
wanted
sessions
to
stop
mueller
from
investigating
the
campaign
and
retool
the
probe
to
focus
on
meddling
in
future
elections
he
also
confirmed
that
trump
dictated
to
him
the
statement
that
sessions
was
supposed
to
make
to
the
public
clearing
trump
of
collusion
and
accusing
mueller
of
breaking
the
law
but
when
it
came
time
for
lewandowski
to
deliver
that
message
to
sessions
he
instead
went
on
vacation
telling
lawmakers
i
took
my
kids
to
the
beach
that
was
more
of
a
priority
the
president
never
asked
me
to
do
anything
illegal
lewandowski
said
read
judiciary
chairman
nadler's
opening
statement
at
lewandowski
hearing
by
and
large
lewandowski
refused
to
answer
questions
from
democrats
the
white
house
had
sent
a
letter
on
monday
to
the
committee
saying
that
it
was
directing
lewandowski
not
to
answer
questions
about
his
conversations
with
trump
beyond
what
is
in
the
mueller
report
lewandowski
vehemently
denied
colluding
with
russia
even
though
he
was
never
formally
accused
of
collusion
he
criticized
his
onetime
internal
rival
former
trump
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
for
sharing
internal
polling
data
with
a
russian
associate
and
he
admitted
that
he
never
called
the
fbi
after
learning
that
a
campaign
adviser
was
in
contact
with
russians
partisan
slugfest
the
dramatic
partisan
split
was
on
full
display
throughout
the
marathon
hearing
democrats
who
control
the
committee
traded
insults
with
lewandowski
one
lawmaker
said
lewandowski
chickened
out
because
he
didn't
follow
trump's
questionable
orders
lewandowski
calls
democratic
rep
sheila
jackson
lee's
questioning
just
a
rant
during
a
brief
recess
lewandowski's
posted
a
link
on
twitter
to
a
new
website
that
is
promoting
his
potential
senate
campaign
next
year
in
new
hampshire
one
senior
democrat
on
the
panel
later
called
out
lewandowski
for
seemingly
using
the
hearing
to
appeal
to
the
gop
base
let
me
remind
you
mr
lewandowski
that
this
is
not
a
republican
primary
campaign
said
rep
hakeem
jeffries
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
caucus
you
are
not
on
the
campaign
trail
yet
this
is
the
house
judiciary
committee
act
like
you
know
the
difference
on
the
other
side
republicans
hailed
lewandowski's
prowess
as
the
campaign
manager
for
trump's
long-shot
presidential
bid
they
tried
to
paint
him
as
a
sympathetic
figure
who
has
already
given
many
hours
of
testimony
to
mueller
and
a
slate
of
congressional
committees
republicans
have
spent
their
time
mostly
attacking
democrats
calling
them
the
party
of
impeachment
in
texas
rep
john
ratcliffe's
words
and
asking
for
hearings
on
other
issues
rep
jim
jordan
the
firebrand
republican
from
ohio
said
lawmakers
should
investigate
alleged
abuses
by
the
justice
department
and
should
not
focus
on
impeachment
a
growing
number
of
democrats
publicly
support
impeachment
though
not
enough
to
pass
a
resolution
i
think
they
hate
this
president
more
than
they
love
their
country
lewandowski
said
of
the
democrats
a
comment
that
later
drew
consternation
from
democratic
members
of
the
panel
the
committee
also
subpoenaed
former
white
house
aides
rick
dearborn
and
rob
porter
to
appear
tuesday
to
testify
about
their
role
in
the
lewandowski
incident
and
other
matters
that
were
mentioned
in
the
mueller
report
they
did
not
show
up
and
the
white
house
previously
claimed
that
both
men
are
immune
from
testifying
before
congress
due
to
executive
privilege
the
committee
has
objected
to
this
rationale
previously
and
is
currently
suing
to
force
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
to
testify
after
the
white
house
made
a
similar
claim
when
he
was
subpoenaed
earlier
this
year
similar
proceedings
could
follow
for
dearborn
and
porter
