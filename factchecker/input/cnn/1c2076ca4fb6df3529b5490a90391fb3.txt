new
economic
disruptions
aren't
trump's
fault
but
are
out
of
his
control
cnn
president
donald
trump
campaigned
for
office
saying
he
alone
could
fix
what
ails
the
us
economy
so
far
he's
created
a
global
trade
war
that's
hurting
china's
economy
and
pressuring
his
own
rust
belt
supporters
but
now
he's
facing
two
crises
he
didn't
cause
and
can't
control
an
oil
crisis
in
saudi
connected
to
a
civil
war
in
yemen
and
a
union
strike
that's
shut
down
gm
striking
auto
workers
in
the
middle
of
the
country
and
strikes
on
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
although
both
threaten
specific
elements
of
the
us
economy
for
which
trump
wants
credit
and
in
an
object
lesson
on
presidential
powerlessness
there
may
be
little
he
can
do
about
either
he
is
learning
the
limits
of
what
a
us
president
can
do
said
douglas
holtz-eakin
who
was
top
economist
at
the
council
of
economic
advisers
under
president
george
w.
bush
you
can
set
the
environment
for
things
to
happen
but
you
don't
make
things
happen
trump's
presidency
has
been
marked
tempests
own
making
he
started
a
trade
war
to
create
pressure
for
new
trade
deals
he
abandoned
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
he's
skirted
congress
to
pay
for
a
wall
many
people
don't
think
is
necessary
intentionally
divisive
policies
like
these
have
held
his
approval
rating
down
so
a
credible
bid
for
reelection
relies
on
an
economy
that
continues
to
expand
even
if
people
don't
like
him
they
probably
need
to
feel
like
things
are
generally
going
okay
recent
polls
suggest
that
despite
continued
low
unemployment
economic
anxiety
is
rising
in
the
country
so
it's
been
essential
for
trump
to
be
able
to
dial
up
his
standoff
with
china
to
look
tough
but
also
delay
tariffs
when
necessary
to
spark
optimism
in
an
ultimate
trade
deal
but
a
regional
war
in
the
middle
east
is
outside
his
control
even
though
it
could
have
serious
consequences
inside
the
us
trump's
emphasis
on
oil
trump
talks
all
the
time
about
the
fact
that
on
his
watch
the
us
has
become
the
world's
top
producer
of
crude
oil
he
did
it
on
twitter
monday
morning
when
he
said
the
us
doesn't
even
need
saudi
oil
and
suggested
you
should
thank
him
for
it
because
we
have
done
so
well
with
energy
over
the
last
few
years
thank
you
mr
president
we
are
a
net
energy
exporter
now
the
number
one
energy
producer
in
the
world
we
don't
need
middle
eastern
oil
gas
in
fact
have
very
few
tankers
there
but
will
help
our
allies
but
he's
also
quite
nervous
about
the
situation
and
the
resulting
spike
in
oil
prices
plenty
of
oil
he
tweeted
sunday
after
saying
he
had
already
authorized
his
government
to
tap
into
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
a
bank
of
oil
the
country
keeps
in
case
of
emergency
he
further
sought
to
tamp
down
concern
on
oil
prices
in
remarks
monday
in
the
oval
office
they
haven't
risen
that
much
he
said
later
adding
it
went
up
and
that
is
not
a
problem
the
situation
in
saudi
arabia
actually
represents
the
largest
oil
disruption
in
history
and
oil
futures
actually
spiked
the
most
in
a
decade
settling
somewhat
after
trump
made
his
comments
about
tapping
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
energy
secretary
rick
perry
clarified
that
the
administration
was
not
yet
moving
to
tap
into
that
reserve
while
that
move
would
work
to
keep
oil
prices
down
trump's
other
allusion
was
that
the
us
was
locked
and
loaded
after
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
and
that
the
country
could
strike
against
iran
for
masterminding
attacks
carried
out
by
yemenis
a
new
us-led
conflict
in
the
middle
east
might
actually
drive
oil
prices
up
a
global
market
trump's
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
to
threaten
countries
buying
oil
from
that
country
hasn't
helped
either
even
before
the
attacks
on
saudi
facilities
oil
prices
were
on
their
way
up
oil
prices
spike
after
saudi
attack
disrupts
global
supply
it's
all
a
reminder
to
a
nationalist
like
trump
that
regardless
of
whether
the
us
is
the
top
oil
producer
the
oil
market
stretches
across
the
world
we
have
a
very
very
unified
global
market
in
petroleum
products
and
crude
oil
and
if
you
restrict
the
supply
anywhere
the
remaining
oil
whether
it's
shale
oil
from
the
united
states
or
norwegian
oil
or
whoever
it
may
be
it's
more
valuable
said
holtz-eakin
trump
has
not
only
bragged
about
us
oil
production
but
said
that
efforts
by
democrats
to
move
the
country
away
from
fossil
fuel
consumption
are
an
actual
assault
on
americans
and
how
they
live
every
leading
democrat
running
for
president
pledges
to
ban
the
energy
that
drives
our
economy
and
wage
and
under
if
you
look
at
what's
going
on
your
way
of
life
is
under
assault
by
these
people
he
said
sept
during
rally
in
north
carolina
promises
to
auto
workers
he
needs
oil
prices
to
be
steady
just
like
he
wants
to
argue
there
is
an
increase
in
manufacturing
jobs
in
the
rust
belt
that's
what
he
promised
his
nationalist
policies
would
accomplish
in
fact
after
those
comments
about
oil
consumption
being
the
american
way
in
north
carolina
trump
argued
that
everything
would
have
been
much
worse
under
the
trans-pacific
partnership
a
massive
trade
deal
negotiated
with
much
of
asia
except
china
you
could
have
kissed
many
of
your
industries
goodbye
trump
said
tpp
would
have
gutted
the
american
auto
industry
except
that
it's
also
clear
today
with
tens
of
thousands
of
auto
workers
striking
in
states
like
michigan
and
ohio
that
trump
must
win
that
his
policies
which
he
pitched
specifically
to
rescue
manufacturing
jobs
haven't
solved
the
auto
industry's
problems
nearly
a
million
americans
work
in
automobile
and
automobile
parts
manufacturing
according
to
bureau
of
labor
statistics
but
the
auto
industry
continues
to
grapple
with
an
evolving
market
gm
recently
closed
a
plant
in
lordstown
ohio
that
made
a
poor-selling
sedan
it's
also
been
hurt
by
trump's
trade
war
and
newly
imposed
chinese
tariffs
on
us
automobiles
america
has
a
huge
stash
of
emergency
oil
this
is
why
trump
for
his
complaints
about
tpp
has
not
yet
achieved
his
own
trade
deal
with
china
his
administration
negotiated
an
update
to
nafta
the
us-canada-mexico
agreement
which
would
require
more
auto
parts
be
manufactured
in
the
us
but
democrats
who
control
the
house
of
representatives
want
some
changes
to
address
concerns
about
workers
the
environment
and
drug
prices
meanwhile
while
the
overall
unemployment
rate
remains
extremely
low
the
auto
workers
will
tell
you
that
not
all
jobs
are
created
equal
it's
not
just
that
recent
events
like
the
spike
in
oil
prices
show
that
trump
or
any
president
can't
control
global
markets
said
jared
bernstein
an
economist
who
worked
for
vice
president
joe
biden
during
the
obama
administration
it's
also
that
his
policies
from
the
regressive
tax
cuts
to
the
damaging
trade
wars
are
clearly
hurting
not
helping
the
working-class
folks
who
responded
to
his
pitch
evolving
markets
in
fact
trump's
pitch
to
workers
in
the
rust
belt
could
be
complicated
by
his
effort
to
turn
the
campaign
into
a
referendum
on
democratic
proposals
for
the
government
to
do
a
lot
more
to
help
workers
including
strengthening
unions
trump
meanwhile
has
warned
of
socialism
and
while
democrats
are
in
their
own
disagreement
over
whether
a
medicare
for
all
plan
would
force
union
workers
off
generous
health
plans
they
negotiated
in
lieu
of
higher
pay
trump
has
spent
so
much
time
targeting
gm
that
he
cannot
credibly
step
in
here
asked
if
he
stood
with
the
auto
workers
trump
said
he
was
sad
to
see
the
strike
and
that
he
hoped
it
was
quick
but
his
focus
was
more
on
gm's
business
than
on
worker
demands
i
would
like
to
see
it
work
out
but
i
don't
want
general
motors
building
plants
in
china
and
mexico
he
said
glossing
over
the
international
supply
chain
that
already
characterizes
the
auto
industry
this
was
before
my
watch
and
i
don't
think
they
will
be
doing
that
i
don't
think
i
had
meetings
with
the
head
of
gm
and
i
don't
want
them
leaving
our
country
i
don't
want
them
building
them
in
china
or
other
countries
top
producer
of
oil
certainly
the
country's
new
position
as
an
oil
exporter
makes
a
price
spike
much
different
from
the
s
when
an
oil
embargo
by
opec
countries
brought
the
us
economy
to
a
standstill
so
you
roll
the
clock
back
or
years
when
oil
prices
went
up
the
us
was
almost
exclusively
a
consumer
of
oil
and
those
prices
were
tantamount
to
a
tax
on
american
consumers
and
we
worried
about
the
fallout
all
the
time
said
holtz-eakin
it's
way
different
to
own
the
oil
when
the
price
goes
up
you
make
some
money
at
the
same
time
trump's
focus
on
oil
comes
along
with
his
dismissive
attitude
about
the
climate
crisis
the
issue
that
has
democrats
and
other
looking
to
wean
the
country
off
oil
in
august
trump
referred
to
renewable
energy
as
dreams
and
not
something
he'd
pursue
at
the
expense
of
wealth
in
oil
i'm
not
going
to
lose
that
wealth
he
said
during
a
press
conference
standing
next
to
the
french
president
emmanuel
macron
i'm
not
going
lose
it
on
dreams
on
windmills
he
said
it's
easier
to
focus
on
oil
as
the
backbone
of
the
us
economy
when
oil
is
cheap
and
when
us
auto
companies
hum
none
of
these
problems
are
new
for
the
us
presidents
have
been
trying
and
failing
to
solve
them
for
decades
here's
the
part
i
find
ironic
or
humorous
which
is
there's
a
lot
about
the
way
trump
talks
about
things
which
is
let's
bring
back
the
s
and
the
s
that
was
just
such
a
great
time
said
holtz-eakin
well
you
got
striking
auto
workers
and
geopolitical
risk
in
the
oil
markets
to
feel
like
we're
back
there
