from
official

announced
thursday
it
was
suspending
the
practice
of
allowing
congressional
staffers
for
the
house
appropriations
committee
on
department-funded
trips
acknowledging
a
rift
between
the
department
and
democratic
lawmakers
who
approve
its
spending
plans
the
department
of
the
interior
will
not
be
funding
any
travel
for
house
appropriation
staff
until
the
ethics
issue
with
their
staff
is
resolved
by
chairwoman
betty
mccollum
and
the
committee
and
the
assurance
is
made
that
all
our
employees
will
be
treated
equally
fairly
and
respectfully

the

did
not
comment
on

directly
led
to
the
fallout
between
the
two
bodies
nbc
news

first
reported
the
spat
reported
late
wednesday
it
involved
a
complaint
over
staff
behavior
involving
an
interior
department
employee
who
attended
an
oversight
trip
because
congress
controls
budgets
of
every
agency
through
the
appropriations
committees
congressional
staff
can
take
trips
to
oversee
any
aspect
of
agency
work
based
on
a
law
the
agency
is
required
to
pay
for
those
trips
as
a
part
of
congress
oversight
work
the
spokeswoman
for
the
department
told
cnn
the
department's
chief
of
staff
reached
out
to
the
appropriations
committee
about
the
issue
but
did
not
receive
a
response
evan
hollander
a
spokesman
for
the
house
appropriations
committee
told
cnn
that
senior
staff
at
interior
have
concocted
this
entire
incident
to
obstruct
the
house's
critical
oversight
work
fabricating
a
story
to
block
congressional
oversight
is
another
example
of
the
trump
administration's
trampling
of
democratic
norms
congressional
democrats
will
not
stand
for
this
illegal
and
outrageous
conduct
hollander
said
mccollum's
spokesman
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
committee
which
is
controlled
by
democrats
and
department
leadership
have
been
at
odds
over
interior
secretary
david
bernhardt's
plan
to
move
the
washington
dc
headquarters
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
colorado
and
shift
hundreds
of
positions
to
the
western
us
bureau
of
land
management
to
move
headquarters
to
colorado
senator
says
the
effort
has
faced
opposition
from
current
and
former
washington
dc-based
blm
employees
who
say
it
will
weaken
the
bureau's
efficiency
and
influence
blm
argues
the
headquarters
move
will
place
staffers
closer
to
the
lands
and
people
they
work
with
bernhardt
said
recently
that
plan
is
moving
forward
after
a
day
period
for
congressional
notification
was
completed
democrats
on
the
committee
objected
to
the
plan
and
said
the
department
did
not
fully
answer
their
questions
