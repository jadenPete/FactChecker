warren
and
sanders
say
americans
don't
like
their
health
insurance
polls
don't
back
that
up
biden
sanders
and
warren
clash
over
health
care
cnn
first
things
first
the
theme
song
of
the
week
is
the
days
and
nights
of
molly
dodd
poll
of
the
week
a
new
kaiser
family
foundation
poll
finds
that
when
it
comes
to
expanding
coverage
and
lowering
health
care
costs
of
democrats
and
democratic
leaning
independents
prefer
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who
does
so
by
building
on
the
affordable
care
act
only
want
do
so
by
voting
for
voting
for
a
candidate
who
replaces
the
aca
with
medicare
for
all
this
poll
is
consistent
with
previous
kaiser
polls
on
the
subject
in
finding
democrats
wanting
to
vote
for
someone
who
builds
on
the
aca
what's
the
point
another
democratic
presidential
debate
was
defined
by
whether
it's
best
to
improve
health
care
coverage
through
medicare
for
all
with
minimal
private
insurance
or
having
private
insurance
with
a
government
run
health
care
option
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
argued
the
former
while
some
others
most
prominently
former
vice
president
joe
biden
argued
the
latter
polls
like
the
one
i
just
cited
indicate
that
the
candidates
who
favor
a
public
option
hold
the
majority
opinion
within
the
democratic
party
our
cnn
poll
from
late
june
directly
posed
the
question
to
potential
democratic
primary
voters
we
asked
whether
there
should
be
a
national
health
care
plan
and
whether
it
should
replace
private
insurance
the
plurality
said
there
should
be
a
government
health
care
plan
but
it
shouldn't
eliminate
private
insurance
just
said
there
should
be
a
national
health
care
plan
and
it
should
eliminate
private
insurance
a
mere
didn't
want
a
government
run
health
care
plan
the
polling
shouldn't
be
too
surprising
when
you
look
at
how
democrats
feel
out
their
own
health
insurance
they
like
it
according
to
gallup
polling
from
late
last
year
of
democrats
said
the
quality
of
health
care
they
received
was
either
good
or
excellent
a
large
majority
believed
their
health
care
coverage
was
either
good
or
excellent
even
when
it
comes
to
health
care
costs
of
democrats
said
were
satisfied
with
what
they
paid
in
health
care
on
thursday
warren
argued
that
despite
these
numbers
she
has
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
it
turns
out
that
kaiser
posed
this
question
to
americans
back
in
do
you
have
a
generally
favorable
or
generally
unfavorable
opinion
of
your
own
health
insurance
company
in
that
poll
of
democrats
they
had
a
favorable
view
of
their
health
insurance
company
that's
triple
the
who
said
they
had
an
unfavorable
view
this
polling
is
probably
the
reason
that
most
of
the
democrats
on
the
thursday
debate
stage
don't
want
to
mostly
eliminate
private
insurance
companies
it
might
also
explain
why
biden
continues
to
lead
the
democratic
race
he's
closer
to
the
median
voter
on
the
marquee
issue
this
primary
season
than
either
his
two
leading
competitors
sanders
or
warren
if
sanders
or
warren
win
the
nomination
it
will
be
in
spite
of
their
health
care
positions
not
because
of
them
even
if
sanders
or
warren
do
become
their
party's
nominee
it
should
be
noted
their
health
care
stances
are
likely
to
be
even
more
harmful
in
the
general
election
while
of
all
voters
want
a
national
health
insurance
option
in
cnn
polling
just
believe
that
should
come
by
eliminating
private
health
insurance
when
not
offered
the
public
option
and
asked
directly
by
marist
college
if
it
was
a
good
idea
to
replace
private
insurance
completely
with
a
national
health
insurance
plan
of
voters
said
it
was
a
good
idea
and
said
it
was
a
bad
idea
moreover
of
all
americans
told
gallup
last
year
they
were
satisfied
with
their
health
care
costs
and
clear
majorities
answered
good
or
excellent
on
the
quality
of
their
health
care
and
coverage
and
similarly
to
democrats
of
all
americans
told
kaiser
in
that
they
had
a
favorable
view
of
their
own
health
insurance
company
perhaps
the
best
hope
for
sanders
and
warren
is
to
not
make
health
care
personal
americans
may
like
their
own
insurance
and
their
own
insurance
company
but
just
are
satisfied
with
the
total
cost
of
health
care
in
america
a
minority
have
a
favorable
view
of
health
insurance
companies
at
large
but
when
you
propose
eliminating
private
insurance
it's
pretty
hard
not
to
make
it
personal
to
the
many
voters
who
rely
on
it
