ufo
videos
are
the
real
deal
cnn
the
us
navy
has
finally
acknowledged
footage
purported
to
show
ufos
hurtling
through
the
air
and
while
officials
said
they
don't
know
what
the
objects
are
they're
not
indulging
any
hints
either
the
objects
seen
in
three
clips
of
declassified
military
footage
are
unidentified
aerial
phenomena
navy
spokesperson
joe
gradisher
confirmed
to
cnn
the
clips
released
between
december
and
march
by
to
the
stars
academy
of
arts
sciences
appear
to
show
fast-moving
oblong
objects
captured
by
advanced
infrared
sensors
in
footage
from
sensors
lock
on
a
target
as
it
flies
before
it
accelerates
out
of
the
left
side
of
the
frame
too
quickly
for
the
sensors
to
relocate
it
two
of
the
videos
both
from
contain
audio
from
us
fighter
pilots
attempting
to
make
sense
of
what
they're
seeing
it's
a
f
g
drone
bro
a
pilot
says
to
his
colleague
in
the
first
clip
my
gosh
they're
all
going
against
the
wind
look
at
that
thing
dude
gradisher
said
the
navy's
transparency
about
unidentified
aerial
phenomena
or
uap
is
largely
done
to
encourage
trainees
to
report
incursions
they
spot
in
the
airfield
which
threaten
pilots
safety
this
is
all
about
frequent
incursions
into
our
training
ranges
by
uaps
he
said
those
incursions
present
a
safety
hazard
to
the
safe
flight
of
our
aviators
and
the
security
of
our
operations
the
public
clips
capture
just
a
fraction
of
the
frequent
incursions
navy
training
ranges
see
he
said
for
many
years
our
aviators
didn't
report
these
incursions
because
of
the
stigma
attached
to
previous
terminology
and
theories
about
what
may
or
may
not
be
in
those
videos
he
said
the
only
way
to
find
out
what
those
uap
are
he
said
is
to
encourage
trainees
to
report
them
when
they
see
them
