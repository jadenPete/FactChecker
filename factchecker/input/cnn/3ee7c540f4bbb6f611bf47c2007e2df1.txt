republicans
want
to
make
orange

red
again

california
cnn
after
a
republican
wipeout
in
orange

san
juan
capistrano
mayor
brian
maryott
is
betting
that
his
record
as
a
quiet
leader
can
help
turn
the
gop's
congressional
fortunes
around
in
southern
california
that
was
the
message
maryott
delivered
to
a
group
of
three
dozen
republicans
at
a
hilly
country
club
home
on
a
recent
sunday
afternoon
as
he
prepares
to
challenge
freshman
democratic
rep
mike
levin
maryott
didn't
criticize
president
donald
trump
in
fact
he
and
numerous
attendees
touted
trump's
record
but
the
mayor's
message
still
drew
a
clear
contrast
with
the
republican
who
will
be
at
the
top
of
the
ticket
in
i'm
a
quiet
leader
in
our
city
i
said
there
were
some
things
i
was
going
to
do
i
was
going
to
take
the
temperature
down
in
city
politics
maryott
said
most
people
don't
associate
with
me
this
big
thing
or
that
bad
thing
or
anything
else
because
i've
been
a
quiet
leader
in
the
city
an
effective
leader
and
that's
what
i
want
to
do
in
washington
maryott
is
one
of
the
many
republican
challengers
looking
to
win
back
the
seven
seats
in
california
that
democrats
flipped
in
when
they
swept
into
the
house
majority
nowhere
was
the
republican
pain
more
acute
than
in
orange
county
the
longtime
stronghold
of
ronald
reagan
republicanism
where
republicans
lost
all
four
of
the
county's
six
districts
they
had
held
the
orange
county
seats
are
seen
as
key
battlegrounds
if
republicans
have
any
chance
to
take
back
the
house
majority
next
year
they
have
to
try
to
figure
out
across
the
country
how
to
get
the
seats
back
to
take
the
house
back
said
fred
whitaker
the
chairman
of
the
orange
county
republican
party
i
think
that
path
has
to
go
through
california
and
i
think
it's
going
to
go
through
orange
county
but
republicans
face
an
uphill
climb
long-term
demographic
shifts
and
an
influx
of
tech
jobs
have
gradually
turned
orange
county
more
democratic
as
it
has
become
younger
and
more
diverse
the
four
democratic
freshmen
in
orange
county
reps
katie
porter
harley
rouda
gil
cisneros
and
levin
will
enjoy
the
built-in
advantages
of
incumbency
including
a
two-year
campaign
runway
and
the
chance
to
build
a
record
of
work
for
the
district
and
perhaps
most
importantly
trump's
unpopularity
could
continue
to
drag
on
republicans
the
president
is
just
horrifically
unpopular
said
fred
smoller
a
political
science
associate
professor
at
chapman
university
in
the
city
of
orange
because
orange
county
republicanism
is
really
a
libertarianism
the
republicans
here
want
lower
taxes
they
want
less
government
regulations
they
want
more
local
control
they
find
the
anti-gay
anti-women's
choice
anti-environment
really
doesn't
fit
democrats
outnumber
republicans
in
a
sign
of
the
county's
shift
the
number
of
registered
democrats
eclipsed
the
number
of
registered
republicans
last
month
and
democrats
now
have
a
roughly
voter
advantage
according
to
data
from
the
orange
county
registrar
of
voters
to
levin
who
was
executive
director
of
the
orange
county
democratic
party
more
than
a
decade
ago
the
change
is
remarkable
we
dreamed
about
the
day
when
we
would
have
more
registered
democrats
he
said
in
an
interview
levin
whose
coastal
district
spans
orange
and
san
diego
counties
cited
a
combination
of
factors
including
the
tech
sector
and
voters
environmental
concerns
for
the
democratic
gains
but
he
also
noted
republicans
still
outnumber
democrats
in
his
portion
of
orange
county
a
sign
that
his
campaign
will
be
no
cakewalk
we
can't
be
complacent
we
can't
take
any
of
these
seats
for
granted
he
said
each
of
us
that
worked
so
hard
to
flip
the
county
need
to
stay
focused
and
we've
got
to
continue
to
build
upon
the
success
we
had
in
to
republicans
the
election
was
a
surprise
but
they
also
argue
it
was
an
anomaly
they
say
democratic
donors
poured
money
into
the
orange
county
congressional
races
in
and
in
they
will
have
a
level
playing
field
with
big
donors
focused
on
the
presidential
contest
i
think
the
last
election
was
a
super
anomaly
to
have
that
kind
of
money
spent
where
they
could
spend
it
across
the
board
said
former
rep
buck
mckeon
a
california
republican
who
retired
from
congress
in
the
presidential
election
nationally
i
think
they'll
soak
up
all
of
that
money
that
went
to
the
congressional
districts
and
the
senate
last
time
whitaker
said
the
most
important
voter-registration
shift
hasn't
been
toward
democrats
but
rather
voters
who
state
no
party
preference
they
now
represent
of
orange
county's
registered
voters
we
can't
take
it
for
granted
and
i
think
for
years
we
did
that
the
republicans
would
come
out
and
vote
and
keep
it
republican
said
greg
raths
the
mayor
of
mission
viejo
who
is
one
of
several
republicans
vying
to
challenge
porter
but
we've
got
our
work
cut
out
for
us
i
think
it's
going
to
be
a
tough
close
race
running
on
a
record
the
democrats
who
flipped
republican
seats
in
ran
against
the
president
and
republicans
control
of
congress
but
now
they
will
have
to
campaign
on
their
own
records
at
town
halls
over
the
summer
recess
democratic
freshmen
have
been
quick
to
tout
the
bipartisan
legislation
they've
helped
pass
and
work
they've
done
with
republicans
while
blaming
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
for
the
gridlock
on
larger
issues
like
health
care
immigration
and
guns
when
rouda
was
asked
at
a
recent
town
hall
whether
he
thought
congress
would
do
something
on
gun
control
he
bluntly
said
no
the
fact
we
have
too
many
politicians
who
won't
do
what
the
public
wants
because
they're
in
the
pocket
of
the
gun
lobby
tells
you
what's
wrong
with
washington
dc
he
said
rep
katie
hill
a
freshman
democrat
who
flipped
a
northern
los
angeles
district
in
said
the
inability
to
pass
high-profile
legislation
made
on-the-ground
district
work
even
more
vital
i
don't
think
any
of
us
were
delusional
in
thinking
that
we
would
be
able
to
go
in
and
pass
these
massive
health
care
bills
that
we
campaigned
on
hill
said
in
an
interview
people
in
these
front-line
seats
in
particular
are
acutely
aware
that
our
jobs
depend
on
us
doing
a
good
job
and
being
effective
representatives
but
trump
is
still
a
key
focus
for
those
democrats
and
in
california
in
particular
trump's
tax
cuts
are
front
and
center
after
the
law's
cap
on
deductions
of
state
and
local
taxes
hit
high-tax
states
like
california
particularly
hard
the
president
was
clear
he
did
it
to
be
punitive
to
certain
people
porter
said
at
a
town
hall
last
month
you
passed
taxes
that
blew
up
our
deficit
but
politically
punished
certain
states
and
certain
areas
that
are
making
it
hard
for
local
and
city
governments
to
fund
services
we
desperately
need
combating
the
trump
effect
republicans
say
they
can
make
orange
county
red
again
because
trump
won't
have
the
same
drag
that
he
did
in
because
our
president's
name
was
not
on
the
ballot
in
the
cycle
you
saw
a
lot
of
people
let
out
their
anger
and
frustration
by
voting
against
any
and
all
republican
candidates
said
young
kim
who
narrowly
lost
in
to
cisneros
and
is
challenging
him
again
in
because
he
will
be
on
the
ballot
they
have
a
choice
and
there
will
be
a
lot
of
split
voters
kim
who
would
be
the
first
korean
american
in
congress
argued
that
the
president's
strong
economy
and
her
message
of
republican
opportunity
would
combat
any
anti-trump
sentiment
maryott
walked
the
line
while
taking
questions
from
supporters
to
note
that
trump
was
not
a
normal
politician
but
still
got
things
done
the
president
is
pretty
bombastic
and
he
probably
registers
a
little
bit
on
the
narcissistic
scale
a
pinch
anyways
but
he's
a
doer
maryott
said
to
laughter
and
applause
he's
created
some
unique
challenges
but
he's
also
created
some
unique
results
still
maryott
made
sure
to
note
where
he
disagreed
with
the
administration
such
as
offshore
drilling
and
he
accused
both
parties
of
lobbing
spitballs
at
each
other
instead
of
solving
the
country's
immigration
problems
republicans
are
also
looking
to
the
economy
which
remains
strong
despite
some
warning
signs
predicting
that
voters
will
be
more
concerned
about
that
than
the
president
all
the
democrats
they
want
to
focus
the
attacks
on
the
president
and
impeachment
to
avoid
talking
about
the
fact
that
nothing
has
been
done
on
kitchen-table
issues
said
peggy
huang
a
yorba
linda
city
councilwoman
who's
among
the
republicans
challenging
porter
when
people
have
to
make
a
choice
between
paying
for
medical
bills
and
putting
food
on
the
table
or
whether
the
president
is
impeached
or
not
those
are
the
issues
i'm
talking
about
could
impeachment
change
the
landscape
as
the
judiciary
committee
moves
forward
with
its
impeachment
investigation
the
republican
campaign
arm
is
ramping
up
its
attacks
on
democrats
over
the
issue
while
some
front-line
democrats
are
getting
more
vocal
in
their
opposition
of
the
seven
freshmen
democrats
in
california
who
flipped
gop
seats
three
are
publicly
supporting
an
impeachment
inquiry
while
four
are
not
those
backing
an
inquiry
have
faced
criticism
maryott
for
instance
argued
against
more
chaos
in
politics
but
he
used
the
line
to
criticize
levin
not
trump
citing
impeachment
and
even
twitter
unfortunately
our
incumbent
is
tweeting
a
couple
times
a
week
he's
bashing
the
president
he's
voting
for
impeachment
as
you
know
maryott
said
he
has
no
respect
for
republican
opinions
we
need
to
partner
with
the
administration
not
fight
lawsuits
levin
has
distinguished
between
supporting
an
impeachment
inquiry
and
impeachment
itself
but
he
acknowledged
the
issue
could
open
democrats
up
to
political
attacks
arguing
that
the
president's
conduct
can't
just
be
ignored
i
think
people
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
future
of
our
democracy
about
the
rule
of
law
clearly
i
appreciate
the
diversity
of
opinion
out
there
he
said
i'm
just
going
to
keep
at
it
and
i
hope
they
will
evaluate
my
service
on
what
i've
done
for
our
district
and
hopefully
understand
the
tough
decisions
that
we
make
a
member
of
the
squad
while
democrats
look
to
tie
their
republican
opponents
to
trump
republicans
want
to
connect
democratic
freshmen
to
their
colleagues
in
the
squad
reps
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
of
new
york
ilhan
omar
of
minnesota
ayanna
pressley
of
massachusetts
and
rashida
tlaib
of
michigan
huang
for
instance
criticized
porter
over
ocasio-cortez's
green
new
deal
claiming
that
it
would
wipe
out
technology
jobs
in
the
district
although
porter
has
not
co-sponsored
the
legislation
and
at
a
town
hall
last
month
levin
was
pressed
by
an
attendee
who
said
what's
going
on
with
the
squad
is
repulsive
and
that
he
had
left
the
democratic
party
because
of
anti-semitism
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
slams
shocking
ad
that
aired
during
democratic
debate
i
called
out
anti-semitism
when
members
of
my
own
party
said
it
i
called
out
anti-semitism
when
the
president
said
it
responded
levin
who
was
raised
both
jewish
and
catholic
maryott
pointed
to
levin's
membership
in
the
congressional
progressive
caucus
to
knock
him
as
an
open
borders
democrat
and
said
levin
supported
a
government
takeover
of
health
care
two
areas
that
republicans
are
likely
to
focus
on
in
as
the
presidential
race
pushes
the
democratic
party
leftward
on
those
issues
rouda
was
pressed
by
a
town
hall
attendee
about
democrats
supporting
open
borders
but
he
pushed
back
first
of
all
democrats
don't
believe
in
an
open
border
rouda
said
to
applause
arguing
that
democrats
had
a
better
immigration
record
on
immigration
because
the
gop
refused
to
take
up
the
senate's
compromise
legislation
porter
who
has
gained
plaudits
in
the
freshmen
class
for
her
sharp
questioning
of
jpmorgan
chase
ceo
jamie
dimon
subtly
distanced
herself
at
her
town
hall
from
democrats
who
have
proudly
said
they
are
socialists
i'm
a
real
champion
for
capitalism
what
we
need
is
capitalism
that
creates
opportunity
porter
said
noting
that
dimon
had
become
her
pen
pal
after
their
april
exchange
smoller
of
chapman
university
said
that
while
trump
remained
unpopular
in
orange
county
the
democratic
choice
at
the
top
of
the
presidential
ticket
could
ultimately
play
a
significant
role
in
the
fate
of
close
congressional
races
the
polling
is
telling
us
that
the
american
people
don't
care
for
trump
but
boy
they
do
not
want
a
socialist
on
the
democratic
ticket
smoller
said
if
you
do
get
too
far
to
the
left
the
democrats
could
shoot
themselves
in
the
foot
