abrams
has
some
advice
for
democrats
washington
cnn
here
are
the
stories
our
panel
of
top
political
reporters
have
on
their
radar
in
this
week's
inside
politics
forecast
stacey
abrams
plans
democrat
stacey
abrams
just
barely
lost
georgia's
gubernatorial
election
last
year
and
she
says
the
presidential
candidates
can
learn
a
lot
from
the
razor-thin
margin
georgia's
got
electoral
votes
and
she
sees
her
race
in
as
a
kind
of
playbook
cnn's
nia-malika
henderson
said
she
got
more
votes
than
any
democrat
in
the
history
of
georgia
elections
she
says
democrats
should
focus
on
unlikely
voters
when
they
typically
focus
on
swing
voters
henderson
said
georgia's
large
number
of
african-american
voters
should
make
it
especially
appealing
to
democrats
next
year
abrams
is
saying
democrats
pay
attention
to
georgia
because
if
you
want
to
expand
the
map
that's
one
way
to
do
it
henderson
said
the
australians
are
coming
to
dinner
new
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
will
be
in
washington
later
this
week
and
president
donald
trump
plans
to
honor
him
with
a
state
dinner
just
the
second
such
occasion
of
his
presidency
there
are
so
many
interesting
things
to
look
at
here
axios
editor
margaret
talev
said
recalling
the
diplomatic
blow-up
over
a
contentious
telephone
call
between
trump
and
morrison's
predecessor
a
call
that
was
leaked
to
the
media
but
now
there
is
a
new
prime
minister
a
different
relationship
and
a
lot
of
common
interest
talev
said
everything
from
dealing
with
iran
to
china
joint
military
exercises
and
talk
on
trade
and
maybe
even
space
so
from
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
a
state
dinner
to
the
nitty-gritty
talks
i'm
really
looking
forward
to
how
this
plays
out
democrats
shift
impeachment
focus
the
judiciary
committee
is
moving
forward
with
what
are
in
effect
impeachment
hearings
they've
subpoenaed
several
trump
campaign
aides
to
testify
this
week
but
julie
hirschfeld
davis
of
the
new
york
times
said
the
real
story
might
be
how
democrats
are
shifting
the
focus
of
their
investigation
get
ready
to
hear
about
the
word
emoluments
davis
said
referring
to
the
clause
in
the
constitution
that
bars
presidents
from
profiting
from
the
presidency
by
accepting
gifts
or
money
from
foreigners
we've
heard
a
lot
from
the
democrats
as
they
look
toward
whether
they
should
impeach
president
trump
about
the
mueller
report
and
russia
but
the
emoluments
issue
is
something
that's
much
more
politically
palatable
to
a
lot
of
them
davis
said
it's
about
corruption
it's
about
self-dealing
and
they
think
that
this
is
also
a
very
rich
vein
because
there's
a
new
example
every
day
of
something
that
might
not
be
quite
appropriate
davis
said
so
look
for
the
congress
to
be
much
more
engaged
in
investigating
that
issue
in
the
days
ahead
north
carolina
redistricting
the
tarheel
state
has
some
of
the
most
gerrymandered
legislative
districts
in
the
country
but
perhaps
for
not
much
longer
a
north
carolina
court
ruled
earlier
this
month
that
they
are
so
partisan
they
violate
the
state's
constitution
and
gave
state
lawmakers
until
this
week
to
submit
a
replacement
reports
vice
news
shawna
thomas
the
court
also
ordered
the
legislature
to
be
fully
transparent
about
heir
decision
making
they
are
broadcasting
it
live
as
they
go
through
this
process
thomas
said
trump
helps
out
a
friend
and
from
cnn
chief
national
correspondent
john
king
trump
this
weekend
made
yet
another
effort
to
help
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
before
tuesday's
israeli
elections
the
question
to
some
is
whether
it
is
the
final
pre-election
effort
the
gesture
the
president
announced
his
hope
of
negotiating
a
joint
defense
agreement
with
israel
specifically
saying
he
hoped
he
could
begin
working
on
it
with
netanyahu
after
the
elections
the
israeli
prime
minister
quickly
sent
a
thank
you
tweet
it
has
never
been
a
secret
that
trump
wants
to
do
all
he
can
to
help
netanyahu
the
white
house
though
has
been
silent
on
another
big
pre-election
netanyahu
gambit
his
announcement
that
if
reelected
he
plans
on
annexing
parts
of
the
west
bank
and
other
areas
that
are
recognized
as
palestinian
territory
or
disputed
land
that
should
be
part
of
peace
negotiations
netanyahu
has
hinted
that
his
plan
has
white
house
support
but
a
number
of
key
international
voices
are
making
it
clear
they
view
the
israeli
plan
as
unacceptable
and
making
it
clear
they
would
frown
on
any
us
embrace
of
netanyahu's
plan
on
tuesday
united
nations
secretary-general
ant
nio
guterres
said
the
israeli
plan
would
constitute
a
serious
violation
of
international
law
and
undermine
the
viability
of
the
two-state
solution
then
on
thursday
five
key
us
allies
issued
a
blunt
statement
rejecting
netanyahu's
proposal
france
germany
italy
spain
and
the
united
kingdom
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
announcement
of
a
possible
annexation
of
areas
in
the
west
bank
particularly
the
jordan
valley
and
the
northern
shore
of
the
dead
sea
the
governments
said
in
a
joint
statement
this
would
if
implemented
constitute
a
serious
breach
of
international
law
france
germany
italy
spain
and
the
united
kingdom
will
continue
to
call
on
all
parties
to
refrain
from
actions
in
contravention
of
international
law
which
would
imperil
the
viability
of
a
two-state
solution
based
on
the
lines
and
make
it
harder
to
achieve
a
just
and
lasting
peace
