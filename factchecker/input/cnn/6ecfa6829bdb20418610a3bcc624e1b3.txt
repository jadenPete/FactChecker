debate
opens
new
fronts
on
guns
biden's
age
in
democratic
race
cnn
the
latest
democratic
debate
threw
up
a
rich
haul
of
clashes
incidents
slow
burning
controversies
and
policy
collisions
that
will
help
define
the
race
in
the
weeks
to
come
often
a
debate's
impact
only
becomes
clear
in
subsequent
days
when
exchanges
that
did
not
immediately
resonate
take
on
extra
significance
as
the
churn
of
the
campaign
does
its
work
thursday's
encounter
in
houston
exposed
ideological
personal
and
policy
divisions
between
the
candidates
that
offer
clues
about
how
the
democratic
race
will
unfold
from
now
on
there's
a
trove
of
material
for
each
campaign
to
mine
to
tweak
the
weaknesses
of
rival
candidates
and
president
donald
trump's
team
must
have
been
watching
with
glee
as
comment
on
guns
and
health
care
piled
up
material
for
general
election

beto
o'rourke
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
over
the
span
of
this
race
there's
little
evidence
that
the
debates
are
changing
the
hierarchy
of
candidates
but
the
confrontations
are
serving
to
expose
the
complex
layers
of
the
campaign
and
offer
clues
over
how
it
may
turn
out
the
top
tier
may
freeze
in
place
the
debate
solidified
the
clear
top
tier
in
this
race
and
none
of
the
leading
candidates
looks
likely
to
quickly
fade
in
the
crucial
run-up
to
the
iowa
caucuses
in
february
former
vice
president
joe
biden
had
a
patchy
night
but
thursday
was
his
best
performance
so
far
in
his
campaign
sen
elizabeth
warren
was
relatively
quiet
but
made
no
huge
mistakes
and
sen
bernie
sanders
will
have
delighted
his
solid
supporters
but
did
not
seem
to
solve
the
riddle
of
broadening
his
base
debates
confirm
there
is
really
only
one
issue
in
the
democratic
primary
these
three
however
have
yet
to
turn
their
full
fire
on
one
another
that's
one
thing
to
watch
for
as
the
race
really
gets
going
outsider
desperation
from
here
on
in
the
clock
is
ticking
for
everyone
else
low
polling
candidates
must
elbow
themselves
into
the
top
tier
julian
castro's
unsubtle
jabs
at
biden's
age
beto
o'rourke's
vow
to
confiscate
assault
rifles
and
an
overt
turn
against
trump
by
kamala
harris
in
a
direct-to-camera
stare
down
are
a
sure
sign
the
pressure
to
stand
out
is
beginning
to
show
in
the
weeks
to
come
keeping
the
cash
flowing
will
become
even
more
important
as
candidates
build
early
state
machines
and
buy
advertising
so
they
must
show
donors
that
they
still
have
a
shot
and
there's
a
reason
to
go
on
a
metric
of
success
for
this
debate
will
come
in
third
quarter
fund
raising
data
at
the
end
of
the
month
businessman
andrew
yang
rolled
out
a
novel
way
of
getting
some
buzz
turning
his
campaign
into
a
raffle
to
give
people
a
month
for
a
year
to
highlight
his
universal
basic
income
plan
biden
and
the
age
issue
castro's
pile-on
was
clumsy
by
repeatedly
asking
biden
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
the
former
hud
secretary
actually
built
empathy
for
the
former
vice
president
but
make
no
mistake
many
of
the
other
candidates
are
happy
this
is
out
there
and
even
happier
that
castro
stepped
on
the
landmine
before
they
had
to
their
post-debate
interviews
are
proof
of
that
joe
biden
has
his
best
debate
night
and
that
might
be
good
enough
there's
a
lot
of
people
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
told
cnn's
anderson
cooper
after
the
debate
harris
was
asked
several
times
on
new
day
about
the
castro
assault
but
pointedly
chose
not
to
criticize
its
author
or
to
defend
biden
the
question
of
whether
the
former
vice
president
is
fit
for
the
rigors
of
the
presidency
and
to
take
on
trump
is
not
going
away
it's
one
of
his
biggest
weaknesses
and
as
even
biden
has
said
it's
fair
game
for
opponents
to
explore
and
biden
put
it
on
the
table
himself
by
rooting
his
campaign
in
an
argument
about
electability
any
stumbles
in
the
democratic
debate
next
month
and
the
issue
will
be
back
on
the
front
burner
moderates
awake
the
dominant
narrative
is
that
this
race
is
taking
democrats
led
by
sanders
warren
and
the
activist
base
so
far
left
that
they
risk
alienating
america's
political
middle
biden
harris
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
sen
amy
klobuchar
and
o'rourke
all
had
strong
moments
pushing
a
pragmatic
brand
of
politics
to
reflect
washington
realities
their
strategy
is
likely
to
become
a
more
overt
theme
in
the
contest
as
the
first
nominating
voting
looms
the
schism
in
the
field
is
especially
evident
on
health
care
broadly
over
whether
to
build
on
obamacare
or
to
go
all
in
on
a
medicare
for
all
push
third
debate
shows
why
democratic
primary
could
take
a
while
to
decide
there
are
signs
that
warren
might
be
hedging
her
bets
and
trying
to
provide
herself
room
to
track
back
toward
the
center
in
a
general
election
campaign
but
her
line
that
i
have
never
met
anyone
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
may
put
off
americans
who
don't
want
to
give
up
employer-provided
plans
it
will
certainly
be
highlighted
by
trump
if
she
ends
up
as
his
democratic
opponent
and
will
reinforce
claims
by
the
moderates
that
progressives
are
leading
democrats
into
a
dead
end
o'rourke
on
guns
brave
move
or
historic
error
another
moment
from
thursday
sure
to
find
its
way
into
an
attack
ad
is
o'rourke's
vow
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
his
call
for
a
mandatory
guns
buy
back
scheme
was
an
impassioned
reaction
to
a
massacre
in
his
home
town
of
el
paso
and
a
strategy
designed
to
help
his
underperforming
campaign
grab
the
spotlight
there's
an
argument
that
gun
politics
is
changing
and
washington
is
yet
to
get
the
message
but
o'rourke
also
risks
playing
into
gop
dogma
that
all
gun
control
is
a
ruse
for
democrats
to
confiscate
the
guns
of
law
abiding
americans
it's
a
base-stoking
claim
already
burning
up
conservative
media
and
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
will
have
to
repeatedly
answer
for
o'rourke's
comment
one
prominent
democrat
is
already
mad
at
o'rourke
i
frankly
think
that
that
clip
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
delaware
sen
chris
coons
said
friday
on
cnn's
newsroom
the
trump
in
the
room
the
democratic
debate
at
times
seemed
from
another
era
candidates
earnestly
clashing
over
policy
pursuing
traditional
political
attacks
and
firing
off
pre-planned
zingers
trump
blew
up
such
conventional
political
codes
in
destroying
the
gop
field
in
assuming
he
shows
up
for
presidential
debates
next
fall
whoever
emerges
from
the
democratic
race
will
have
to
deal
with
the
president's
brawling
outlandish
style
while
democrats
were
quarreling
over
the
nuances
of
health
care
trump
counter-programmed
with
a
whirling
campaign
pitch
at
a
republican
retreat
in
baltimore
he
vented
against
bans
of
plastic
straws
complained
about
energy
saving
light
bulbs
trump
claimed
made
him
look
orange
and
included
a
bizarre
aside
about
republican
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy
the
most
overblown
lines
from
donald
trump's
baltimore
speech
kevin
is
just
like
a
cow
he's
just
smaller
trump
said
overall
the
democratic
presidential
race
marks
an
implicit
bet
that
americans
are
tired
of
trump's
act
and
that
offering
clear
plans
on
issues
like
health
care
is
an
antidote
to
the
craziness
that
rocks
the
white
house
every
day
biden
has
made
the
most
obvious
pitch
so
far
for
the
role
of
trump
slayer
harris
joined
the
game
on
thursday
night
meaning
that
the
question
of
electability
will
be
increasingly
important
in
the
weeks
to
come
