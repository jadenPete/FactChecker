why
race
is
moving
center
stage
for
tapper
to
o'rourke
is
it
racist
to
vote
for
trump
in
cnn
an
escalating
cycle
of
action
and
reaction
between
president
donald
trump
and
the
democratic
presidential
contenders
is
thrusting
issues
of
race
relations
and
american
identity
to
the
center
of
the
developing
campaign
in
office
trump
has
appealed
even
more
overtly
than
he
did
as
a
candidate
in
to
the
racial
resentments
of
some
white
voters
with
such
comments
as
his
call
for
four
house
democratic
women
of
color
to
go
back
where
they
came
from
and
his
declaration
that
very
fine
people
had
marched
on
both
sides
in
charlottesville
virginia
in
response
partly
to
trump
and
partly
to
demands
from
the
party
base
the
democratic
presidential
contenders
are
talking
more
explicitly
than
hillary
clinton
did
in
about
systemic
racism

biden
at
last
week's
democratic
presidential
debate
in
houston
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
of
texas
echoed
a
recent
new
york
times
project
and
declared
that
the
introduction
of
slavery
in
not
the
declaration
of
independence
in
was
the
foundational
event
in
shaping
america
racism
in
america
is
endemic
o'rourke
declared
it
is
foundational
we
can
mark
the
creation
of
this
country
not
at
the
fourth
of
july
but
august
when
the
first
kidnapped
african
was
brought
to
this
country
against
his
will
simultaneously
the
eruption
of
new
allegations
of
sexual
assault
and
misconduct
against
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
and
trump's
emphatic
immediate
defense
of
his
nominee
is
but
one
of
several
issues
that
are
likely
to
highlight
questions
about
the
changing
role
of
women
in
society
the
cumulative
effect
could
be
to
compound
the
dynamic
evident
in
when
an
array
of
political
science
studies
found
that
attitudes
about
racism
and
sexism
predicted
support
for
trump
or
clinton
much
more
powerfully
than
people's
assessments
of
their
own
economic
situations
in
the
studies
found
the
more
likely
voters
were
to
say
that
racism
and
sexism
are
no
longer
problems
in
american
life
the
more
likely
they
were
to
vote
for
trump
recent
surveys
have
likewise
found
that
trump
runs
far
better
among
voters
who
believe
that
discrimination
against
minorities
is
not
a
major
problem
than
those
who
do
trump
supporters
are
also
far
more
likely
than
other
americans
to
maintain
that
discrimination
against
whites
is
a
significant
problem
the
surveys
have
found
attitudes
toward
these
dynamics
is
something
that
has
divided
the
parties
for
quite
awhile
says
brian
schaffner
a
political
scientist
at
tufts
university
who
conducted
some
of
the
research
about
the
impact
of
attitudes
toward
racial
and
gender
discrimination
in
but
there's
something
trump
has
added
to
this
trump
and
his
rhetoric
just
make
these
divisions
more
explicit
rhetoric
is
raising
issues
profile
in
the
contrast
between
the
nominees
on
issues
of
race
relations
will
likely
be
as
stark
as
any
since
the
republicans
in
nominated
sen
barry
goldwater
who
opposed
the
civil
rights
act
against
president
lyndon
johnson
who
steered
it
into
law
trump
has
appealed
to
racial
resentments
more
openly
than
any
national
figure
in
either
party
since
george
wallace
in
the
s
while
declaring
that
democrats
are
the
real
racists
for
accusing
him
and
by
implication
his
supporters
of
racism
at
the
same
time
the
democratic
candidates
are
portraying
america
as
infected
with
racism
more
openly
and
insistently
than
any
previous
party
leaders
even
barack
obama
the
first
african
american
president
many
of
the
democrats
are
explicitly
calling
trump
a
racist
and
some
have
expressed
sympathy
for
the
concept
of
providing
reparations
to
african
americans
for
the
long-term
impact
of
slavery
that
means
both
parties
are
now
framing
the
debate
over
america's
changing
identity
in
a
manner
that
seems
likely
to
elevate
the
role
of
these
issues
in
sorting
voters
between
the
two
sides
schaffner
thinks
these
divisions
could
grow
more
pronounced
in
whether
democrats
nominate
a
woman
or
racial
minority
to
face
trump
or
pick
a
white
man
if
democrats
select
a
woman
or
racial
minority
that
candidate
like
clinton
and
obama
will
personify
social
change
in
a
way
likely
to
provoke
the
core
republican
voters
who
are
most
uneasy
about
it
he
notes
on
the
other
hand
if
democrats
nominate
a
white
man
that
candidate
will
likely
feel
pressure
to
respond
to
the
party's
increasingly
diverse
electoral
coalition
by
talking
more
explicitly
than
past
nominees
about
structural
or
systemic
racism
if
democrats
nominate
a
white
male
that
person
on
one
hand
might
seem
less
threatening
to
moderate
voters
who
maybe
have
somewhat
conservative
racial
views
says
schaffner
on
the
other
hand
that
candidate
given
what
the
democratic
party
base
looks
like
these
days
is
going
to
have
to
campaign
somewhat
more
explicitly
on
issues
that
matter
to
minority
groups
that
dynamic
was
evident
in
the
sort
of
charged
language
that
o'rourke
used
at
last
week's
democratic
debate
about
slavery's
role
in
shaping
american
society
major
components
of
the
democratic
coalition
might
consider
such
bracing
talk
long
overdue
but
it
is
also
virtually
certain
to
make
racially
conservative
voters
feel
more
resentful
notes
schaffner
attitudes
have
bigger
role
in
shaping
votes
the
heightened
pressure
on
the
democratic
field
is
also
evident
in
the
fierce
blowback
from
many
liberal
nonwhite
writers
and
political
activists
to
biden's
comments
during
last
week's
debate
about
sending
social
workers
to
help
low-income
parents
raise
their
children
in
part
by
using
a
record
player
at
night
in
their
substance
if
not
their
tangled
exposition
and
anachronistic
references
biden's
arguments
reflected
standard-issue
thinking
among
bill
clinton-era
new
democrats
about
fusing
calls
for
more
personal
responsibility
to
programs
designed
to
expand
opportunity
for
low-income
and
minority
families
but
in
today's
more
highly
charged
racial
environment
biden's
call
for
such
interventions
drew
charges
from
prominent
minority
writers
of
paternalistic
racism
and
one
of
the
most
explicitly
racist
moments
of
all
time
in
a
democratic
primary
debate
detailed
studies
of
public
opinion
during
the
trump
era
have
almost
universally
concluded
that
there
has
not
been
significant
change
in
the
share
of
americans
who
believe
or
dispute
that
discrimination
against
minorities
and
women
is
still
a
problem
in
american
society
what's
changed
under
trump
is
that
attitudes
on
those
questions
have
become
more
important
in
shaping
how
americans
vote
in
their
book
identity
crisis
for
instance
political
scientists
john
sides
michael
tesler
and
lynn
vavreck
reported
that
multiple
post-election
surveys
found
that
whites
attitudes
about
race
ethnicity
and
religion
came
to
play
a
larger
role
in
than
in
other
recent
elections
working
with
two
colleagues
schaffner
likewise
found
that
in
the
more
likely
voters
were
to
believe
that
racial
discrimination
is
not
a
systemic
problem
and
that
women
complaining
about
sexism
were
actually
seeking
unfair
advantage
over
men
the
more
likely
they
were
to
support
trump
that
relationship
was
as
powerful
among
women
voters
as
among
men
and
for
both
groups
those
attitudes
dwarfed
voters
assessments
of
whether
their
personal
economic
situations
were
improving
or
deteriorating
in
a
follow-up
paper
this
year
schaffner
found
that
attitudes
about
whether
racism
or
sexism
persists
as
a
problem
predicted
support
for
republican
or
democratic
congressional
candidates
in
more
powerfully
than
they
did
in
or
the
previous
midterm
election
in
the
reason
for
that
greater
correlation
was
that
some
previously
republican-leaning
voters
who
are
more
liberal
on
issues
relating
to
racial
and
gender
discrimination
peeled
away
from
the
party
to
support
democratic
candidates
last
year
he
found
an
array
of
recent
public
opinion
surveys
has
found
that
a
huge
chasm
persists
between
the
democratic
and
republican
coalitions
on
whether
minorities
still
face
discrimination
in
america
an
august
national
quinnipiac
university
survey
found
that
voters
who
support
trump
are
much
more
likely
than
those
who
don't
to
believe
that
whites
face
significant
discrimination
in
america
today
and
african
americans
and
immigrants
do
not
according
to
detailed
figures
provided
to
me
by
the
pollsters
in
the
quinnipiac
survey
fully
of
voters
who
approved
of
trump's
job
performance
said
that
discrimination
against
whites
was
a
very
or
somewhat
serious
problem
today
according
to
those
previously
unpublished
results
only
of
voters
who
disapproved
of
trump's
performance
agreed
conversely
while
of
voters
who
disapprove
of
trump's
performance
say
discrimination
against
african
americans
is
a
problem
just
of
those
who
approve
of
him
agree
the
gap
is
similar
for
immigrants
while
of
voters
who
disapprove
of
trump
say
immigrants
face
discrimination
just
of
trump
supporters
agree
put
another
way
more
trump
supporters
say
whites
face
discrimination
than
say
immigrants
or
african
americans
do
a
solid
majority
of
trump
supporters
say
african
americans
do
not
face
serious
discrimination
and
a
plurality
say
the
same
about
immigrants
among
voters
who
don't
approve
of
trump
the
pattern
is
inverted
two-thirds
of
them
say
whites
don't
face
discrimination
while
only
about
in
say
the
same
about
blacks
or
immigrants
polling
reflects
the
trend
these
attitudes
loom
over
preliminary
vote
choices
for
according
to
the
quinnipiac
findings
in
the
survey
trump
held
a
to
lead
over
biden
among
the
roughly
two-fifths
of
voters
who
believe
that
discrimination
against
whites
is
a
problem
biden
led
trump
by
to
among
the
majority
who
said
it
is
not
conversely
trump
held
an
to
advantage
among
the
quarter
of
the
electorate
who
say
discrimination
against
african
americans
is
not
a
problem
while
biden
led
by
to
among
the
nearly
three-fourths
who
say
it
is
attitudes
about
gender
relations
divide
trump
supporters
and
opponents
in
similar
patterns
an
extensive
recent
study
that
pollster
tresa
undem
conducted
for
the
liberal
women's
activist
group
supermajority
found
huge
gaps
between
liberal
and
conservative
women
not
only
on
political
choices
such
as
whether
abortion
should
remain
legal
but
on
underlying
social
trends
such
as
whether
women
have
achieved
equal
treatment
in
american
society
or
whether
women
interpret
too
many
remarks
from
men
as
sexist
undem's
findings
reinforced
the
results
of
studies
from
schaffner
and
his
colleagues
as
well
as
those
by
erin
cassese
of
the
university
of
delaware
and
tiffany
barnes
of
the
university
of
kentucky
which
found
that
female
voters
who
supported
trump
in
were
far
less
likely
than
those
who
backed
clinton
to
believe
that
women
face
discrimination
and
far
more
likely
to
believe
children
are
better
off
if
their
mothers
stay
at
home
and
that
families
succeed
when
men
work
and
women
raise
the
children
for
many
trump
supporters
they
don't
see
a
problem
with
how
women
or
minorities
are
treated
says
undem
whose
firm
polls
mostly
for
nonprofit
organizations
and
liberal
advocacy
groups
then
they
are
supersensitive
to
being
called
racist
and
sexist
she
continues
i
just
get
the
sense
they
have
fused
their
own
identity
in
trump
so
to
attack
trump
is
to
attack
them
they
are
saying
no
i'm
not
a
racist
and
there's
no
racism
many
polls
this
summer
have
found
that
a
majority
of
americans
believe
that
trump
is
racially
insensitive
and
disrespectful
in
the
harshest
possible
phrasing
quinnipiac
found
in
july
that
a
majority
of
americans
consider
trump
a
racist
but
private
polling
conducted
in
recent
weeks
by
the
firm
gqr
for
a
consortium
of
liberal
groups
has
stirred
debate
in
democratic
circles
by
concluding
that
the
party
nonetheless
is
unlikely
to
benefit
among
voters
by
directly
labeling
trump
a
racist
that
was
partly
because
right-leaning
voters
consider
the
phrase
too
loosely
applied
to
any
conservative
and
partly
because
some
swing
voters
recoil
from
the
level
of
personal
acrimony
inherent
in
the
charge
anna
greenberg
the
democratic
pollster
who
conducted
that
research
says
democrats
could
find
sturdier
ground
by
accusing
trump
of
using
race
to
divide
the
country
rather
than
personally
harboring
racist
beliefs
and
by
talking
about
structural
racial
inequities
a
wonky
conversation
about
institutional
racism
and
solutions
to
it
i
don't
think
is
threatening
to
most
people
she
says
the
tripwire
for
democrats
among
some
white
voters
she
believes
is
when
they
frame
policies
to
expand
opportunities
for
minorities
as
a
kind
of
penance
for
whites
the
difference
is
if
you
are
saying
this
is
your
fault
and
you
must
pay
the
price
of
your
ancestors
that's
when
i
think
you
start
getting
in
a
little
bit
of
trouble
with
voters
navigating
that
line
isn't
likely
to
be
easy
for
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
that's
especially
true
because
trump
routinely
portrays
any
criticism
of
his
behavior
as
an
attempt
to
brand
his
preponderantly
white
supporters
as
racist
from
the
other
direction
as
the
fierce
blowback
against
biden's
record
player
comments
signal
democrats
face
more
pressure
than
ever
to
explicitly
denounce
racism
and
to
portray
it
as
the
predominant
force
shaping
life
in
america
for
minority
groups
even
if
that
formulation
antagonizes
some
white
voters
those
dynamics
are
two
trains
gathering
speed
on
track
for
a
head-on
collision
before
november
