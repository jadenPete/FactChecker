washington
cnn
president
donald
trump's
former
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
said
wednesday
that
he
doesn't
think
he
will
be
held
in
contempt
of
congress
a
day
after
the
house
judiciary
committee's
chairman
threatened
to
do
so
following
a
contentious
hearing
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
be
held
in
contempt
and
i've
told
the
members
of
congress
i'm
happy
to
come
back
and
answer
more
questions
if
they
need
me
to
after
the
five-
or
six-hour
charade
i
went
through
yesterday
lewandowski
a
former
cnn
political
commentator
told
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
the
testy
back-and-forth
between
lewandowski
and
camerota
continues
the
former
campaign
official's
steadfast
stonewalling
of
both
democratic
investigators
as
well
as
media
scrutiny
of
trump's
white
house
and
campaign
on
tuesday
lewandowski
sat
for
a
roughly
six-hour
house
judiciary
committee
hearing
in
which
he
largely
ignored
questions
from
the
panel's
democrats
on
whether
trump
obstructed
justice
the
hearing
which
was
the
first
official
impeachment-related
hearing
on
capitol
hill
in
the
wake
of
the
russia
investigation
was
largely
filled
with
barbs
partisan
attacks
and
references
to
lewindowski's
possible
new
hampshire
us
senate
campaign
the
hearing
grew
so
heated
that
the
panel's
democratic
chairman
jerry
nadler
of
new
york
threatened
to
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
saying
later
that
the
white
house's
effort
to
restrict
lewandowski's
testimony
was
based
on
crony
privilege
lewandowski
stonewalls
and
frustrates
democrats
in
contentious
capitol
hill
hearing
at
one
point
in
wednesday's
cnn
interview
lewandowski
questioned
what
he
would
be
held
in
contempt
for
arguing
that
he
answered
a
considerable
amount
of
the
questions
posed
to
him
by
the
panel's
members
the
former
campaign
official
did
occasionally
disclose
new
details
about
his
role
in
an
incident
that
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
examined
for
potential
obstruction
he
confirmed
that
trump
told
him
to
order
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
curtail
the
mueller
investigation
so
that
it
would
only
look
for
future
election
meddling
and
stop
probing
his
campaign
lewandowski
who
appeared
before
the
committee
under
subpoena
expressed
frustration
on
wednesday
about
the
order
saying
to
camerota
that
he's
now
testified
in
front
of
congress
on
four
separate
occasions
and
spoke
to
the
special
counsel's
office
on
two
separate
occasions
they
could
have
just
asked
me
to
come
and
i
would
have
been
happy
to
do
so
they
chose
to
subpoena
me
and
change
the
rules
last
week
and
i
was
still
there
he
said
lewandowski
i
have
no
obligation
to
be
honest
with
the
media
at
the
hearing
lewandowski
revealed
that
he
hadn't
read
mueller's
nearly
page
report
an
admission
he
reiterated
to
camerota
on
wednesday
during
a
testy
exchange
about
the
report's
content
by
the
way
the
mueller
report
was
very
clear
there
was
no
collusion
there
was
no
obstruction
lewandowski
said
that's
not
what
the
mueller
report
said
corey
camerota
replied
it
absolutely
says
that
you
should
read
the
page
that
states
that
on
lewandowski
said
did
you
read
the
mueller
report
camerota
asked
to
which
the
former
campaign
official
replied
no
i
never
did
during
his
cnn
interview
lewandowski
also
addressed
an
exchange
he
had
during
the
hearing
with
barry
berke
a
lawyer
for
the
democrats
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
in
which
he
said
he
has
no
obligation
to
tell
the
truth
to
the
media
i'm
as
honest
as
i
can
be
as
often
as
i
can
be
lewandowski
told
camerota
