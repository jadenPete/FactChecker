the
peril
and
promise
of
joe
biden
and
what
else
to
watch
for
this
week
in
cnn
with
days
until
the
iowa
caucuses
and
a
record
number
of
democratic
candidates
the
election
is
in
full
swing
every
sunday
i
will
outline
the
big
storylines
you
need
to
know
to
understand
the
upcoming
week
on
the
campaign
trail
and
they're
ranked
so
the
no
story
is
the
most
important
of
the
coming
week
who's
going
to
win
south
carolina
on
monday
several
democratic
candidates
will
be
in
the
palmetto
state
for
the
galivants
ferry
stump
meeting
where
the
candidates
speak
from
literal
stumps
which
got
me
thinking
about
south
carolina
and
its
role
in
this
nomination
fight
the
vote
is
set
for
saturday
february
yes
is
a
leap
year
which
puts
it
days
after
the
iowa
caucuses
days
after
the
new
hampshire
primary
and
a
week
after
the
nevada
caucuses
the
state
is
seen
at
least
at
the
moment
primarily
as
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
firewall
in
the
event
he
can't
win
iowa
or
new
hampshire
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
race
biden's
strength
in
the
state
is
heavily
fueled
by
his
popularity
in
the
african-american
community
which
if
history
is
any
guide
will
comprise
well
more
than
half
of
all
primary
voters
but
the
state's
large
voting
black
population
also
makes
it
a
very
attractive
potential
target
for
california
sen
kamala
harris
who
is
also
black
and
has
dedicated
significant
time
and
organizing
efforts
in
the
state
the
question
i
have
and
the
biden
people
must
have
too
is
whether
or
not
black
voters
in
south
carolina
stick
with
the
former
vp
all
the
way
until
february
if
he
doesn't
win
either
of
the
first
two
major
votes
what
if
elizabeth
warren
wins
iowa
and
new
hampshire
and
roars
into
south
carolina
with
all
the
momentum
or
if
harris
wins
iowa
or
places
a
close
second
does
that
change
the
calculus
of
black
voters
in
south
carolina
the
state
has
yet
to
receive
the
full
attention
of
the
national
media
horde
due
to
the
fact
that
it
votes
almost
a
month
after
iowa
but
if
past
is
prologue
south
carolina
could
be
again
the
state
that
makes
or
breaks
the
presidential
frontrunner
warren's
big
speech
the
rise
of
elizabeth
warren
in
the
campaign
after
a
very
rough
start
has
been
built
less
on
major
speeches
than
on
her
relentless
energy
in
town
halls
and
her
policy
shop's
unending
series
of
proposals
to
address
everything
from
electoral
college
reform
to
criminal
justice
reform
heck
her
campaign
even
sells
warren
has
a
plan
for
that
t-shirts
which
is
what
makes
warren's
planned
speech
on
monday
in
washington
square
park
in
new
york
city
all
the
more
noteworthy
the
address
is
touted
as
a
speech
on
how
corruption
in
washington
has
allowed
the
rich
and
powerful
to
grow
richer
and
more
powerful
according
to
the
facebook
event
page
her
campaign
clearly
sees
this
speech
as
a
major
moment
in
her
campaign
a
chance
to
deliver
a
forceful
condemnation
of
wall
street
and
washington
in
a
way
that
reaches
both
her
adoring
base
but
also
the
wider
democratic
party
inherent
in
warren's
bashing
of
the
influence
of
corporate
interests
will
be
the
fact
that
she
has
refused
any
corporate
or
political
action
committee
money
in
this
campaign
while
her
main
rival
for
the
nomination
joe
biden
has
been
far
less
stringent
in
inspecting
where
donations
come
from
battleground
new
mexico
president
donald
trump
jets
to
new
mexico
on
monday
for
a
campaign
rally
the
latest
sign
that
his
campaign
thinks
he
can
make
the
land
of
enchantment
competitive
in
trump
visited
new
mexico
during
the
campaign
but
lost
the
state
by
points
to
hillary
clinton
but
george
w.
bush
won
new
mexico
albeit
very
narrowly
in
and
the
state
has
shown
the
occasional
willingness
to
elect
other
republicans
like
susana
martinez
who
spent
eight
years
as
governor
trump
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
has
repeatedly
suggested
that
trump
can
win
in
new
mexico
and
in
june
said
trump
would
win
in
the
state
if
the
election
were
held
that
day
the
pro-trump
argument
is
that
trump's
push
to
de-regulate
the
oil
and
gas
industries
has
led
to
an
economic
boom
in
major
energy
producing
states
like
new
mexico
the
state's
unemployment
rate
was
in
july
all
that
said
the
state
seems
like
a
heavy
lift
for
trump
new
mexico
is
almost
half
hispanic
and
those
voters
have
trended
toward
democrats
in
recent
years
handing
democrats
control
over
both
senate
seats
all
three
house
seats
and
the
governor's
mansion
but
remember
that
trump
needs
to
find
ways
to
expand
the
map
particularly
if
michigan
wisconsin
or
pennsylvania
all
of
which
he
won
in
revert
back
to
their
traditional
democratic
voting
patterns
biden
will
be
the
frontrunner
for
another
month
biden
had
his
best
first
hour
of
a
debate
last
week
in
houston
while
he
faded
down
the
stretch
big
time
the
storyline
coming
out
of
the
debate
was
biden's
strong
first
hour
and
the
very
controversial
move
by
juli
n
castro
to
inject
biden's
age
and
competency
into
the
race
all
of
which
means
that
biden
will
likely
keep
the
lead
he
has
held
in
polling
since
he
entered
the
race
in
the
spring
through
at
least
the
mid-october
debates
sponsored
by
cnn
and
in
ohio
to
date
debate
performance
has
been
the
one
thing
that
has
moved
candidates
numbers
in
any
meaningful
way
and
the
longer
biden
stays
on
top
the
more
the
idea
seeps
into
the
democratic
consciousness
that
he
will
wind
up
as
the
nominee
even
if
has
to
endure
a
few
ups
and
downs
along
the
way
and
all
of
that
works
in
biden's
favor
because
his
case
to
democratic
voters
is
built
on
two
things
inevitability
and
electability
and
one
feeds
off
the
other
the
longer
biden
stays
ahead
in
democratic
primary
polling
the
more
people
in
and
out
of
the
party
see
him
as
the
nominee
the
more
he
is
seen
as
the
nominee
the
more
meaningful
general
election
polling
that
shows
biden
beating
trump
is
up
points
in
a
wapo-abc
poll
this
week
and
the
easier
it
is
for
biden
to
make
the
electability
argument
but
the
slings
and
arrows
are
going
to
start
really
flying
sure
biden
wound
up
benefiting
from
castro's
attack
in
this
debate
but
what
castro
did
is
likely
to
create
a
sort
of
open
season
on
the
former
vice
president
especially
given
per
no
above
he
continues
to
be
the
clear
frontrunner
and
the
iowa
caucuses
keep
getting
closer
and
closer
notice
amid
all
of
the
generally
negative
post-debate
coverage
about
castro's
attack
on
biden
there
was
this
from
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
d
i
think
that
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
while
booker's
line
got
overlooked
amid
the
crush
of
attention
on
biden-castro
it
might
have
been
the
most
consequential
thing
that
happened
as
it
relates
to
where
biden's
opponents
are
going
remember
that
the
is-biden-ready-for-primetime
questions
began
with
ohio
rep
tim
ryan
then
they
moved
to
castro
then
to
booker
what's
the
pattern
the
is-he-up-to-this
conversation
is
moving
closer
and
closer
to
center
stage
being
picked
up
by
candidates
who
are
more
serious
threats
to
biden's
nomination
which
begs
the
question
when
do
kamala
harris
elizabeth
warren
or
bernie
sanders
go
there
on
biden
