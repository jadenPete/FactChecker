accused

during

of
contradicting
himself
on
whether
his
health
care
plan
would
require
americans
to
buy
into
it
he
appeared
to
suggest
that
biden
was
losing
his

from
his
fellow

are
you
forgetting
what
you

are
you

what
you

two
minutes
ago
castro
said
thursday
night
the
age
of
biden
has
been
a
subject
of
discussion
early
in
the
democratic
presidential
race
ohio
rep
tim
ryan
a
democrat
running
for
president
who
did
not
qualify
for
thursday's
debate
said
last
week
the
former
vice
president
is
declining
biden
has
said
it's
totally
appropriate
for
people
to
consider
his
age
when
evaluating
him
as
a
presidential
candidate
though
he's
repeatedly
said
he
has
the
vigor
necessary
for
the
job
asked
on
cnn
friday
morning
if
he
was
questioning
biden's
memory
castro
replied
this
is
the
game
that
the
media
like
to
play
castro
said
he
would've
posed
the
same
question
of
the
other
candidates
on
stage
if
they
had
done
something
similar
to
biden
it
didn't
matter
that
it
was
joe
biden
if
it
had
been
another
candidate
that
tried
to
deny
what
they
just
said
two
minutes
ago
i
would
have
asked
them
the
same
thing
castro
said
on
cnn
friday
biden's
deputy
campaign
manager
kate
bedingfield
categorized
castro's
attack
as
personal
and
factually
wrong
she
argued
that
castro's
attack
did
more
damage
to
himself
than
biden
fellow
texas
democrat
and
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
criticized
castro's
attack
on
biden
seeing
it
as
a
personal
jab
if
you've
got
a
policy
difference
with
joe
biden
by
all
means
let's
air
it
at
the
debate
but
that
kind
of
personal
attack
i
don't
think
is
what
we
need
right
now
and
is
insufficient
to
the
challenges
that
we
face
o'rourke
told
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
