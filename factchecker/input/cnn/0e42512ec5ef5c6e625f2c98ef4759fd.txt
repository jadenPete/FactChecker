investigation

into

who

for
her

to
an
international
shipping
company
run
by
members
of
her
family
chairman
elijah
cummings
a
maryland
democrat
wrote
in
a
letter
to
chao
cummings
said
he
was
investigating
multiple
allegations
against
the
secretary
including
troubling
questions
about
whether
you
are
using
your
office
to
benefit
you
and
your
family
the
chairman
also
said
he
was
probing
chao's
failure
to
divest
of
stock
in
a
construction
company
whose
board
she
used
to
sit
on
the
investigation
comes
several
months
after
chao
came
under
fire
her
connections
to
the
shipping
company
the
foremost
group
which
is
based
in
the
us
but
has
ties
to
china
the
company
was
founded
by
chao's
father
and
its
current
ceo
is
her
sister
in
june
cnn
reported
that
chao
was
receiving
criticism
from
house
democrats
and
watchdogs
who
raised
questions
about
whether
chao
was
using
her
position
to
benefit
the
company
the
investigation
is
the
latest
example
of
house
democrats
using
their
oversight
power
to
look
into
whether
or
not
members
of
president
donald
trump's
cabinet
are
acting
unethically
in
their
official
roles
the
probe
could
be
met
with
resistance
by
the
administration
as
other
congressional
investigations
have
been
in
recent
months
spotlight
on
elaine
chao
after
public
appearances
with
family
members
in
a
statement
to
cnn
on
tuesday
a
dot
spokesperson
acknowledged
that
the
department
received
cummings
letter
and
that
it
was
prepared
to
respond
adding
media
attacks
targeting
the
secretary's
family
are
stale
and
only
attempt
to
undermine
her
long
career
of
public
service
in
the
letter
to
chao
cummings
notes
that
federal
laws
prohibit
federal
employees
from
using
their
public
offices
for
the
private
gain
of
friends
relatives
or
persons
with
whom
the
employee
is
affiliated
in
a
nongovernmental
capacity
the
chairman
cites
a
number
of
media
reports
that
he
says
show
how
she
has
used
her
position
to
benefit
the
foremost
group
in
june
cnn
reported
that
chao
has
sat
with
her
father
for
chinese-language
media
interviews
appeared
with
him
at
an
award
ceremony
and
at
a
photoshoot
listed
on
her
schedule
with
him
and
other
foremost
group
employees
at
the
media
center
of
the
department
of
transportation
which
oversees
the
us
shipping
industry
cnn
also
found
that
chao
has
accompanied
her
father
or
sister
to
more
than
a
dozen
events
in
china
in
roughly
the
last
decade
which
have
included
meetings
with
chinese
government
officials
chao's
financial
disclosures
show
she
holds
no
stake
in
the
foremost
group
rep
raja
krishnamoorthi
an
illinois
democrat
who
sits
on
the
committee
said
tuesday
that
chao's
actions
are
part
of
a
problematic
pattern
within
the
administration
unfortunately
there's
a
pattern
in
the
trump
administration
where
cabinet
official
after
cabinet
official
appears
to
be
using
their
public
office
oftentimes
for
private
gain
and
that's
the
concern
here
as
well
he
told
cnn's
kate
bolduan
on
at
this
hour
elaine
chao
sold
stock
in
companies
after
report
raised
ethics
issue
the
committee
is
asking
chao
to
turn
over
a
slew
of
documents
that
span
her
time
as
secretary
including
all
communications
between
her
and
her
father
and
sister
as
well
as
all
documents
sent
to
or
from
department
employees
and
foremost
group
employees
the
investigation
is
also
looking
into
chao's
failure
to
divest
of
stock
from
vulcan
materials
a
construction
company
whose
board
of
directors
she
used
to
sit
on
according
to
the
letter
though
she
pledged
to
sell
her
stock
in
the
company
chao
maintained
it
until
a
wall
street
journal
report
earlier
this
year
revealed
she
hadn't
in
june
she
divested
from
the
company
according
to
the
letter
the
committee
will
be
probing
chao's
actions
that
may
have
benefited
the
company
in
which
she
continued
to
hold
shares
and
her
compliance
with
ethics
and
financial
disclosure
requirements
