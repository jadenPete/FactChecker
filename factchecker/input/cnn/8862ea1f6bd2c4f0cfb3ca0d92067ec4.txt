cnn
president
donald
trump
made
it
clear
a
day
after
firing
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
that
he
will
be
calling
the
shots
on
us
foreign
policy
and
possibly
changing
course
in
wide
ranging
comments
to
reporters
in
the
oval
office
on
wednesday
trump
held
forth
on
iran
and
afghanistan
pausing
to
criticize
bolton
for
his
positions
on
iraq
and
north
korea
and
make
clear
he
disagreed
with
his
former
adviser's
stance
on
venezuela
while
bolton
pushed
tough
measures
against
iran
and
north
korea
and
in
the
past
has
advocated
for
the
use
of
military
force
against
both
trump
praised
the
potential
of
both
countries
and
did
not
rule
out
easing
sanctions
on
tehran
a
change
the
regime
is
demanding
before
it
will
engage
in
talks
john
bolton
joins
a
long
long
list
of
trump
national
security
team
departures
the
president
hinted
at
high-level
contacts
with
both
pyongyang
and
tehran
saying
those
are
two
countries
we're
dealing
with
right
now
on
a
very
high
level
and
he
declared
that
talks
with
the
taliban
are
dead
that
was
my
decision
trump
said
of
the
move
to
cancel
a
camp
david
meeting
planned
for
just
a
few
days
before
the
anniversary
of
the
september
terror
attacks
with
the
militant
group
that
once
sheltered
osama
bin
laden
and
al
qaeda
reportedly
a
subject
of
disagreement
with
bolton
who
disapproved
and
what
we're
doing
now
is
my
decision
trump
said
the
president
suggested
wednesday
that
he
isn't
necessarily
looking
into
facilitating
a
meeting
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
at
the
upcoming
un
general
assembly
in
new
york
later
this
month
but
left
the
door
open
i'm
not
looking
at
anything
he
said
i
do
believe
they'd
like
to
make
a
deal
if
they
do
that's
great
and
if
they
don't
that's
great
too
iran
and
north
korea
have
potential
asked
whether
he'd
consider
easing
sanctions
to
make
a
meeting
happen
trump
said
we'll
see
what
happens
i
think
iran
has
potential
and
i
think
north
korea
has
those
are
two
countries
we're
dealing
with
right
now
on
a
very
high
level
and
he
repeated
a
pledge
that
might
be
seen
as
reassurance
for
iran's
leaders
we're
not
looking
for
regime
change
trump
added
in
his
remarks
about
the
taliban
talks
the
president
emphasized
that
we
are
hitting
the
taliban
right
now
harder
than
they've
ever
been
hit
what
they
did
was
horrible
why
john
bolton
had
to
leave
and
what
to
expect
next
they've
been
hit
very
hard
i
know
for
a
fact
they
said
that
was
a
big
mistake
that
they
made
and
it
was
said
trump
who
went
on
to
describe
a
car
bomb
attack
last
week
for
which
the
taliban
has
taken
credit
when
they
killed
a
great
american
soldier
when
they
killed
people
innocent
people
essentially
innocent
people
because
if
you
look
i
mean
many
of
these
people
were
civilians
you
also
had
a
nato
soldier
in
addition
to
our
great
soldier
but
what
they
did
in
order
to
create
what
they
thought
was
a
better
negotiating
stance
he
said
the
taliban
has
taken
responsibility
for
at
least
nine
us
service
member
deaths
in
and
likely
is
responsible
for
another
seven
given
the
location
of
those
deadly
attacks
areas
seen
having
a
strong
taliban
presence
a
total
of
american
service
members
have
been
killed
in
afghanistan
in
and
over
us
service
members
have
killed
in
afghanistan
since
trump
and
administration
officials
have
not
explained
why
the
car
bomb
attack
last
week
resulting
in
the
death
of
sgt
elis
barreto
ortiz
tipped
the
balance
and
led
trump
to
cancel
the
talks
on
wednesday
though
trump
told
reporters
that
after
ortiz's
death
i
said
that's
the
end
of
them
get
them
out
i
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
them
bolton's
influence
waned
the
moment
he
became
national
security
adviser
trump
also
said
that
he
disagreed
with
bolton
on
venezuela
the
trump
administration
has
thrown
its
full
support
behind
interim
venezuelan
president
juan
guaido
and
at
one
point
appeared
to
back
an
attempt
by
the
opposition
leader
to
oust
embattled
president
nicolas
maduro
i
disagreed
with
john
bolton
on
his
attitudes
on
venezuela
i
thought
he
was
way
out
of
line
and
i
think
i've
proven
to
be
right
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
that
trump
said
without
elaborating
on
the
exact
nature
of
the
disagreement
we
have
a
policy
on
venezuela
that's
a
firm
policy
trump
went
on
venezuela's
really
hurting
and
we're
trying
to
help
in
a
humanitarian
way
that's
probably
not
good
in
terms
of
crushing
a
terrible
regime
but
you
have
people
dying
disagreements
with
bolton
laid
bare
trump
repeatedly
returned
to
bolton
in
part
because
of
reporters
questions
john
is
somebody
that
i
actually
got
along
with
very
well
the
president
said
of
bolton
but
he
made
some
big
mistakes
trump
pointed
to
bolton's
talk
about
the
libyan
model
as
a
road
map
for
north
korea
denuclearization
as
one
misstep
the
libyan
model
is
a
reference
to
a
secret
agreement
libyan
leader
moammar
gadhafi
made
with
the
uk
and
the
us
to
voluntarily
give
up
nuclear
equipment
he
had
purchased
from
a
pakistani
scientist
who
also
sold
to
iran
and
north
korea
in
when
the
us
joined
european
military
action
against
libya
gadhafi
fled
and
was
ignominiously
killed
by
rebels
who
found
him
in
a
ditch
after
the
allied
invasion
of
libya
launched
north
korea's
foreign
minister
at
the
time
declared
that
the
push
for
libya
to
denuclearize
had
been
an
invasion
tactic
to
disarm
the
country
that
memory
casts
a
shadow
over
us
negotiations
with
north
korea
today
and
particularly
when
bolton
raised
it
in
an
interview
we
were
set
back
very
badly
when
john
bolton
talked
about
the
libyan
model
and
he
made
a
mistake
and
as
soon
as
he
mentioned
that
the
libyan
model
what
a
disaster
trump
said
trump
says
he
canceled
secret
camp
david
meeting
with
taliban
leaders
take
a
look
at
what
happened
with
gadhafi
with
the
libyan
model
and
he's
using
that
to
make
a
deal
with
north
korea
and
i
don't
blame
kim
jong
un
for
anything
he
said
after
that
he
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
john
bolton
and
that's
not
a
question
of
being
not
tough
that's
a
question
of
being
not
smart
to
say
something
like
that
trump
said
he
also
went
after
bolton
several
times
over
his
role
in
the
invasion
of
iraq
which
took
place
while
bolton
was
serving
under
the
president
george
w.
bush
administration
john
is
known
as
a
tough
guy
he's
so
tough
he
got
us
sent
to
iraq
the
president
commented
mr
tough
guy
you
have
to
go
into
iraq
i
don't
say
it
was
his
decision
you
had
a
president
and
you
had
other
people
also
but
he
was
very
out
there
i
can
tell
you
trump
said
he
disagreed
with
that
decision
from
the
very
beginning
here
we
are
many
many
years
later
decades
later
and
we're
still
there
he
added
asked
about
bolton's
departure
the
president
said
that
the
longtime
washington
operative
would
likely
do
whatever
he
can
to
spin
it
his
way
but
that
he
had
asked
bolton
to
resign
he
sat
right
in
that
chair
trump
said
pointing
to
a
chair
in
the
oval
office
and
i
told
him
john
you've
got
too
many
people
you're
not
getting
along
with
people
he
continued
saying
he
told
bolton
i
wish
you
well
but
i'd
like
you
to
submit
your
resignation
and
he
did
that
