how
john
roberts
killed
the
census
citizenship
question
washington
cnn
chief
justice
john
roberts
cast
the
deciding
vote
against
president
donald
trump's
attempt
to
add
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
but
only
after
changing
his
position
behind
the
scenes
sources
familiar
with
the
private
supreme
court
deliberations
tell
cnn
the
case
was
fraught
with
political
consequences
democrats
and
civil
rights
advocates
claimed
the
query
would
discourage
responses
to
the
decennial
questionnaire
from
new
immigrants
and
minorities
and
affect
the
balance
of
power
nationwide
roberts
action
recalled
his
dramatic
switch
in
the
case
that
saved
president
barack
obama's
affordable
care
act
once
again
the
chief
an
appointee
of
president
george
w.
bush
and
a
reliable
conservative
had
sided
with
the
liberals
as
a
dispute
of
immense
national
significance
went
down
to
the
wire
more
broadly
his
moves
in
the
census
dispute
demonstrate
that
as
he
begins
his
th
year
as
chief
justice
roberts
has
become
less
predictable
he
is
wearing
the
heavy
mantle
of
a
vote
at
the
middle
of
a
divided
bench
in
this
new
chapter
of
his
tenure
with
the
retirement
of
centrist-conservative
justice
anthony
kennedy
and
a
solid
conservative
majority
for
the
most
part
roberts
opinion
in
the
census
case
laid
out
why
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
had
significant
latitude
to
add
a
new
question
he
was
joined
by
his
four
conservative
brethren
on
that
point
but
then
the
chief
justice
swerved
and
joined
by
the
four
liberal
justices
said
ross
justification
for
the
citizenship
question
tied
to
enforcing
the
voting
rights
act
was
contrived
after
the
justices
heard
arguments
in
late
april
roberts
was
ready
to
rule
for
ross
and
the
administration
but
sometime
in
the
weeks
that
followed
sources
said
roberts
began
to
waver
he
began
to
believe
that
ross
rationale
for
the
citizenship
question
had
been
invented
and
that
despite
the
deference
he
would
normally
give
an
executive
branch
official
ross
claim
had
to
matter
in
the
court's
final
judgment
which
roberts
announced
on
june
roberts
action
in
the
case
adds
a
new
dimension
to
the
question
that
has
hung
over
trump's
presidency
and
is
especially
at
the
forefront
as
the
justices
begin
a
new
annual
session
in
october
will
america's
highest
court
restrain
the
administration's
most
controversial
policies
the
inside
story
of
how
john
roberts
negotiated
to
save
obamacare
on
the
whole
the
year-old
roberts
has
given
the
trump
administration
great
leeway
a
year
ago
he
accepted
its
arguments
and
wrote
the
court's
opinion
upholding
trump's
travel
ban
and
earlier
this
year
roberts
voted
to
allow
the
administration
to
ban
transgender
people
from
serving
in
the
military
and
allow
trump
to
use
military
funds
to
build
a
border
wall
on
wednesday
night
he
let
drastic
limits
on
central
americans
seeking
asylum
at
the
southern
border
take
effect
yet
on
the
census
roberts
turned
against
the
administration
unlike
the
other
branches
of
government
the
supreme
court
is
highly
secretive
and
justices
and
their
staff
rarely
disclose
what
they
talk
about
behind
closed
doors
these
developments
are
reported
here
for
the
first
time
but
much
is
still
unknown
about
the
private
deliberations
roberts
declined
to
comment
on
this
report
passions
on
the
citizenship
question
in
proposing
to
add
the
citizenship
question
to
the
full
census
ross
insisted
that
it
was
needed
because
the
justice
department
needed
citizenship
data
to
enforce
the
voting
rights
act
multiple
cities
states
and
civil
rights
groups
sued
saying
that
the
question
would
decrease
the
response
rate
of
new
immigrants
and
because
the
count
is
used
to
apportion
seats
for
the
us
house
of
representatives
and
statehouses
undercut
political
representation
for
mainly
urban
heavily
immigrant
locales
in
america
the
figures
also
determine
how
funding
for
a
multitude
of
federal
programs
is
distributed
nationwide
after
a
trial
in
new
york
us
district
court
judge
jesse
furman
ruled
that
ross
among
other
transgressions
had
violated
the
administrative
procedure
act's
prohibition
on
arbitrary
and
capricious
agency
choices
furman
said
the
evidence
showed
that
soon
after
ross
took
office
in
early
he
discussed
the
addition
of
the
citizenship
question
with
then-white
house
adviser
steve
bannon
furman
found
that
ross
had
sought
to
add
the
citizenship
question
independent
of
the
doj
request
which
he
had
solicited
to
back
up
his
plan
p
erhaps
most
egregiously
furman
said
in
an
opinion
that
ran
pages
the
evidence
is
clear
that
secretary
ross's
rationale
was
pretextual
that
is
that
the
real
reason
for
his
decision
was
something
other
than
the
sole
reason
he
put
forward
in
his
memorandum
namely
enhancement
of
doj's
vra
enforcement
efforts
the
trump
administration
appealed
furman's
decision
directly
to
the
supreme
court
saying
the
matter
was
urgent
because
census
forms
would
have
to
be
printed
by
summer
during
oral
arguments
on
april
roberts
suggested
there
were
grounds
for
adding
the
citizenship
question
that
had
not
been
asked
of
all
households
since
we've
had
demographic
questions
on
the
census
i
don't
know
how
far
back
but
certainly
it's
quite
common
sex
age
things
like
that
do
you
own
your
house
do
you
own
a
radio
i
mean
the
questions
go
quite
beyond
how
many
people
there
are
roberts
said
the
cvap
citizen
voting
age
population
is
the
critical
element
in
voting
rights
enforcement
and
this
is
getting
citizen
information
he
added
related
read
oral
arguments
in
supreme
court
census
citizenship
case
the
chief
justice
did
not
question
whether
ross
had
concocted
his
justification
for
the
citizenship
question
as
furman
had
found
the
challengers
lawyers
avoided
the
topic
as
well
instead
stressing
that
commerce
department
had
violated
standards
and
safeguards
for
policy
changes
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
only
person
to
use
the
word
contrived
and
emphasize
the
possible
pretextual
grounds
was

elena
kagan
you
can't
read
this
record
without
sensing
that
this
need
is

contrived

she

solicitor
general
noel
francisco
representing
ross
and
the
commerce
department
based
on
the
tenor
of
the
arguments
journalists
and
legal
commentators
presumed
that
the
court
was
headed
for
a
conservative-liberal
vote
inside
the
court
after
initial
deliberations
that
was
how
the
justices
divided
but
the
decision-writing
process
is
fluid
as
they
draft
and
share
opinions
justices
sometimes
change
positions
subtly
in
ways
that
affect
parts
of
the
legal
reasoning
undergirding
an
opinion
or
more
dramatically
in
ways
that
affect
the
entire
outcome
sources
familiar
with
deliberations
say
that
two
such
noteworthy
changes
occurred
last
session
in
the
census
controversy
and
in
a
dispute
over
the
validity
of
a
federal
sex
offender
registration
act
in
that
latter
case
the
justices
upheld
the
act
by
a

justice
brett
kavanaugh
did
not
participate
in
that
case

on
the
second
day
of
the
new
session
because
he
was
not
yet

began

and
stretched
until

a
different
five-justice

in
the
opposite
direction
toward
invalidating
the

and
potentially
limiting
the
authority
of

to
delegate

roberts

and
have
increasingly
entrenched

roberts
was
joined
in
that
case
centering
on
challenges
to
districts
in
north
carolina
and
maryland
by
his
fellow
justices
on
the
right
as
the
four
justices
on
the
left
passionately
dissented
the
political
nature
of
the
case
and
that
divide
between
justices
generated
exactly
the
kind
of
criticism
that
justices
are
merely
politicians
in
black
robes
that
roberts
spent
much
of
the

thwart

there's
also
the
question
of
the

it
is
not

how
roberts
might
have
been
influenced
in
the
census
dispute
by
information
that
emerged
on
may
in

reports
and
court
filings
that
appeared
to
reinforce
the
possibility
that
ross
had
not
been
truthful

set
of
challengers
represented
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
notified
the
high
court
that
day
of
new

purporting
to
show
that
a
longtime
republican
redistricting
strategist
thomas
hofeller
may
have
provided
the

act
enforcement
rationale
used
by
ross
hofeller
who
died
last
year

apparently
wanted

eventually

words

and

francisco
in

the

as
an
eleventh-hour
campaign
to
improperly
derail
the
supreme
court's
resolution
of
the
government's
appeal
consolation
for
the
trump
administration
roberts
census
opinion
didn't
leave
the
trump
administration
empty-handed
something
the
justice
department
has
been
quick
to
recognize
and
use
in
the
upcoming
session
as
the
justices
take
up
a
consequential
calendar
of
cases
testing

rights
in

regulations
and
possibly
abortion

they
will
also
review

last
month
the
justice
department
used
roberts
own
words
from

case
as
it
defended
trump's
effort
to
end
the
obama-era
policy
of
delaying
deportation
of
young
undocumented
immigrants

the

be

again

says
judges
should
not
second-guess
a
cabinet
secretary's
choices
that
fall
in
roberts
words
within
the
range
of
reasonable
options
what
is
ultimately
found
to
be
reasonable
in
the
new
supreme
court
session
remains
in
the
hands
of
a
chief
justice
who
long
known
as
personally
enigmatic
had
become
similarly
inscrutable
on
the
law
