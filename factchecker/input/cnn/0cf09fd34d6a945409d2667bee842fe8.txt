o'rourke's
buyback
pledge
unsettles
senators
working
on
gun
control
compromise
bills
beto
o'rourke
we
should
stop
selling
weapons

washington
cnn
former
rep
beto
o'rourke's
full-throated
call
for
a
mandatory
government
buyback
of
assault-style
weapons
has
frustrated
some
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
who
are
trying
to
find
a
way
forward
on
gun
legislation
that
republicans
and
democrats
can
agree
on
the
argument
is
that
o'rourke's
comment
feeds
into
a
long-held
conservative
talking
point
that
opening
the
door
to
any
changes
on
gun
laws
even
something
as
minor
as
expanding
background
checks
could
lead
democrats
to
eventually
force
people
to
give
up
their
guns
i
frankly
think
that
that
clip
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
sen
chris
coons
d-delaware
told
cnn's
poppy
harlow
on
newsroom
friday
morning
asked
if
he's
supportive
of
o'rourke's
pledge
coons
responded
i
am
not
i
don't
think
a
majority
of
the
senate
or
the
country
is
going
to
embrace
mandatory
buybacks
we
need
to
focus
on
what
we
can
get
done
coons
added
o'rourke
replied
to
coons
on
twitter
responding
to
a
video
of
the
cnn
interview
by
saying
much
respect
to
sen
coons
for
leading
the
fight
on
background
checks
but
the
time
for
letting
status
quo
politics
determine
how
far
we
can
go
is
over
if
we
agree
that
having
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
is
a
bad
idea
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
sen
pat
toomey
a
pennsylvania
republican
who
has
pushed
a
measure
expanding
background
checks
along
with
west
virginia
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
agreed
with
coons
on
twitter
this
is
an
awful
and
extreme
idea
thankfully
there's
not
enough
support
in
congress
to
do
it
but
this
rhetoric
undermines
and
hurts
bipartisan
efforts
to
actually
make
progress
on
commonsense
gun
safety
efforts
like
expanding
background
checks
he
tweeted
a
democratic
aide
said
o'rourke's
comments
only
feeds
into
the
nra's
narrative
that
democrats
are
going
to
take
away
your
guns
beto
o'rourke
hell
yes
we'll
take
your
ar-
if
beto
wants
to
actually
solve
of
these
problems
he
should
help
negotiate
or
encourage
his
colleagues
to
pass
common-sense
background
checks
the
aide
said
adding
if
beto
really
wanted
to
help
he
would
end
his
failing
presidential
campaign
and
run
for
senate
and
give
democrats
the
vote
they'd
need
during
the
presidential
debate
thursday
night
o'rourke
said
that
if
elected
president
he
would
issue
a
mandatory
buyback
program
for
assault-style
rifles
saying
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
the
comments
are
striking
not
just
for
their
directness
but
also
because
for
decades
democrats
have
avoided
suggesting
that
the
government
should
take
back
guns
out
of
concern
that
such
a
platform
would
be
politically
toxic
in
much
of
the
country
asked
by
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
friday
if
he
was
concerned
that
his
call
would
imperil
democrats
chances
in
the
general
election
o'rourke
said
he
was
not
and
that
he's
been
listening
to
conservatives
it's
not
a
concern
of
mine
and
that's
in
part
informed
by
listening
to
people
in
conservative
parts
of
america
and
the
southwestern
part
of
virginia
he
said
the
folks
in
bland
county
as
conservative
as
it
might
be
as
proud
a
gun
owner
as
they
might
be
they're
talking
about
this
issue
and
folks
are
saying
look
i
would
give
up
that
ar-
or
that
ak-
i
don't
need
it
to
hunt
don't
need
it
to
defend
myself
in
my
home
they
recognize
this
is
a
weapon
designed
for
war
to
kill
people
as
effectively
as
efficiently
and
in
as
great
a
number
as
possible
o'rourke
is
one
of
three
democrats
along
with
sens
kamala
harris
of
california
and
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
to
support
mandatory
buybacks
for
certain
guns
other
democrats
would
make
them
illegal
but
not
require
them
to
be
bought
back
by
the
government
