things

all
of
the
top
contenders
in
the
democratic
presidential
race
will
be
on
the
same
stage
for
the
first
time
thursday
night
when
they
meet
for
the
party's
third
primary
debate
in
this
round
the
requirements
to
qualify
were
higher
which
winnowed
what
had
been
candidate
field
spread
over
two
nights
down
to
a
single
candidate
stage
at
the
center
of
the
stage
the
front-runner
in
national
polls
former
vice

joe
biden
will
be
sandwiched
between
his
two
chief
progressive
foes
in

and
vermont

sanders
how
to

and

sen
amy
klobuchar
will
all
look
for
ways
to
break
out
with
the
first
states
set
to
vote
in
the
primary
in
less
than
five
months
here
are
six
things
to
watch
thursday
night
in
houston
biden
vs
warren
these
two
who
the
washington
post
characterized
as
long-time
frenemies
have
risen
to
the
top
of
the
polls
with
drastically
different
strategies
as
biden
promises
a
return
to
pre-donald
trump
normalcy
and
warren
argues
for
bigger
structural
changes
the
two
have
found
themselves
on
opposing
sides
of
economic
debates
as
early
as
when
warren
then
a
professor
opposed
a
biden-backed
bankruptcy
bill
in
committee
you
gave
me
hell
biden
told
her
in
when
he
swore
warren
in
to
the
senate
cnn
poll
biden
leads
as
warren
and
sanders
battle
for
second
on
eve
of
debate
thursday
will
be
the
first
time
they'll
share
a
debate
stage
a
reality
that
could
offer
democratic
voters
a
stark
view
of
the
contrasts
in
how
the
two
approach
politics
will
they
engage
much
directly
it's
hard
to
predict
advisers
for
both
candidates
have
been
downplaying
the
notion
of
a
head-to-head
battle
though
some
sniping
has
emerged
such
as
a
biden
adviser
telling
cnn
the
former
vice
president
will
argue
on
stage
that
we
need
more
than
plans
as
for
warren
a
campaign
aide
said
she
will
identify
what's
broken
in
america
she
will
show
her
plans
on
how
to
make
real
change
and
she
will
talk
about
how
she's
building
a
movement
to
make
it
happen
where
does
bernie
sanders
fit
in
polls
show
that
sanders
is
right
there
with
biden
and
warren
atop
the
field
and
his
campaign
has
howled
that
the
political
press
is
writing
him
out
of
stories
about
the
state
of
the
race
even
though
he
is
firmly
entrenched
in
the
top
tier
but
part
of
why
sanders
sometimes
doesn't
get
much
mention
is
that
his
message
and
his
platform
medicare
for
all
free
college
tuition
a
an-hour
minimum
wage
haven't
changed
much
since
and
don't
really
change
based
on
the
venue
where
will
sanders
jump
into
the
fray
one
possibility
is
if
biden
repeats
his
often-used
line
from
his
stump
speech
and
early
advertising
that
characterizes
the
progressive
push
for
medicare
for
all
as
an
effort
to
undo
obamacare
i
think
if
that's
the
conversation
that
comes
up
there'll
be
no
flinch
on
his
part
this
is
exactly
the
debate
we
want
to
have
sanders
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
said
the
dangers
of
punching
up
the
most
memorable
moment
of
the
first
two
democratic
debates
was
harris
eviscerating
biden
over
his
previous
opposition
to
federally
mandated
school
busing
and
it
gave
harris
a
temporary
jolt
in
the
polls
sending
her
briefly
into
the
high
teens
since
then
though
she
has
fallen
back
in
the
pack
and
headed
into
the
third
debate
harris
campaign
is
suggesting
the
risk
isn't
worth
repeating
the
former
california
attorney
general's
new
approach
direct
her
prosecutorial-style
ire
toward
trump
joe
biden
expected
to
argue
in
upcoming
debate
that
we
need
more
than
plans
kamala
will
take
on
donald
trump
directly
and
will
focus
on
bringing
the
country
together
by
defeating
him
and
unifying
americans
around
solutions
to
our
common
challenges
she'll
make
the
connection
between
his
hatred
and
division
and
our
inability
to
get
things
done
for
the
country
harris
spokesman
ian
sams
said
the
change
in
approach
for
harris
shows
the
challenge
facing
everyone
outside
the
top
three
of
biden
warren
and
sanders
to
rise
in
the
polls
democrats
need
the
candidates
ahead
of
them
to
fall
but
so
far
going
on
the
attack
hasn't
been
rewarded
in
the
long
term
harris
slipped
in
the
polls
castro
and
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
unloaded
on
o'rourke
in
the
first
debate
yet
still
trail
him
former
maryland
rep
john
delaney
was
central
to
the
second
debate
used
as
a
foil
for
warren
and
sanders
but
he
didn't
get
any
traction
out
of
it
how
will
the
low-polling
candidates
stand
out
going
on
the
attack
hasn't
worked
but
that
doesn't
mean
some
democrats
won't
be
willing
to
try
it
still
most
are
looking
for
other
ways
to
stand
out
buttigieg
has
cast
his
campaign
as
shifting
into
a
new
phase
with
field
offices
opening
and
more
hires
being
made
in
the
early
states
as
he
makes
the
case
for
generational
change
he's
also
criticized
trump
for
demeaning
the
presidency
the
purpose
of
the
presidency
is
not
to
glorify
the
president
it
is
to
unify
the
people
he
said
tuesday
in
washington
o'rourke
since
the
el
paso
texas
mass
shooting
last
month
has
centered
his
campaign
around
a
push
for
gun
control
including
a
call
for
a
mandatory
buyback
of
assault-style
firearms
he's
also
going
to
houston
the
capital
of
the
energy
industry
days
after
calling
for
a
ban
on
offshore
drilling
castro
got
to
houston
early
telling
a
crowd
monday
that
the
city
is
a
place
where
people
from
different
walks
of
life
and
all
over
the
world
have
come
to
make
a
life
to
reach
for
their
american
dream
this
is
the
kind
of
place
that
rejects
donald
trump
klobuchar
meanwhile
told
the
new
york
times
she
is
tired
of
debate
questions
to
her
being
framed
around
her
opposition
to
progressive
contenders
ideas
placing
her
in
the
position
of
telling
democratic
voters
that
they
can't
have
the
things
they
aspire
to
what's
yang
planning
yang
has
a
big
idea
giving
every
american
per
month
and
a
devoted
online
following
that
calls
itself
the
yang
gang
but
he
hasn't
made
a
mark
in
democratic
debates
so
far
will
that
change
well
his
campaign
manager
made
an
ominous
promise
the
daily
beast's
sam
stein
tweeted
andrew
yang's
campaign
manager
just
called
to
tell
me
that
at
tomorrow
night's
debate
yang
will
be
doing
something
no
presidential
candidate
has
ever
done
before
in
history
he
declined
to
go
further
than
that
is
one
night
better
than
two
just
candidates
qualified
for
this
debate
but
it
looks
like
an
th
billionaire
investor
and
democratic
activist
tom
steyer
will
meet
the
democratic
national
committee's
qualifying
threshold
for
the
october
round
that
could
make
for
a
much
different
setting
than
we've
seen
so
far
with
five
or
six
candidates
on
stage
spread
over
two
nights
would
giving
fewer
candidates
more
time
to
express
their
ideas
make
for
a
more
informative
viewing
experience
or
do
democratic
voters
prefer
to
tune
in
and
see
all
their
leading
candidates
at
once
the
uncertainty
could
factor
into
how
each
contender
approaches
thursday
night
since
there's
no
guarantee
this
same
cast
of
candidates
will
share
the
stage
again
next
month
and
therefore
no
guarantee
they'll
have
the
same
opportunity
to
highlight
contrasts
in
policy
and
approach
with
the
foes
they
believe
they
need
to
knock
down
again
in
a
few
weeks
