wednesday
that
omar's
previous
remarks
hurt
me
personally
my
family
and
other
victims

families
also
saying

felt
as
a
son
of
a
victim
to
step
up
and
set
the
record
straight
he
said
it
was
the
right
time
to
speak
out
and
argued
that
his
comments
were
not
political
i
was
not
speaking
to
a
woman
a
woman
of
color
or
a
democrat
they
were
remarks
for
a
congresswoman
who
i
feel
should
have
sympathy
for
fellow
americans
he
said
omar's
office
declined
to
comment
on
haros
criticisms
when
reached
by
cnn
wednesday
but
earlier

omar
tweeted
from
her
personal

that
september
th
was
an
attack
on
all
of
us

i
will
continue
to
fight
to
make
sure
we
care
for
the
first
responders
and
families
who
lost
loved

to
those
tweets
haros
jr
told
cnn
that
omar
showed
respect
for
the
loss
of
families
and
that
was
a
good
thing
trump
tweeted
a
video
in
april
using
imagery
attacking
omar's
march
remarks
but
the
under-a-minute
video
that
trump
posted
did
not
include
omar's
comments
in
context
the
congresswoman
who
was
defended
by
democrats
while
conservative
circles
heavily
criticized
her
comments
said
at
the
time
that
she
had
experienced
an
increase
in
death
threats
in
her
first
remarks
following
the
president's
tweeting
of
the
video
omar
in
april
condemned
what
she
called
trump's
vile
attacks
and
demented
views
saying
at
the
time
when
this
occupant
of
the
white
house
chooses
to
attack
me
we
know
we
know
that
that
attack
isn't
for
ilhan
that
attack
is
the
continuation
of
the
attacks
that
he
has
leveled
against
women
against
people
of
color
against
immigrants
against
refugees
and
certainly
against
muslims
