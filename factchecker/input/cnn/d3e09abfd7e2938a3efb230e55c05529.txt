list
the
house
democrats
calling
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
into
trump
presidential
impeachment
what
to
know
cnn
as
president
donald
trump
has
been
openly
feuding
with
house
democrats
pursuing
investigations
into
him
his
administration
and
his
finances
dozens
of
lawmakers
almost
entirely
democrats
are
calling
to
start
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
first
step
in
a
lengthy
and
likely
divisive
process
those
calls
have
grown
louder
following
testimony
from
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
before
congress
in
july
more
than
three
dozen
house
democrats
have
come
out
publicly
in
support
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
since
mueller's
appearance
that
includes
house
foreign
affairs
chairman
eliot
engel
of
new
york
and
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
impeachment
appears
politically
risky
for
democrats
for
many
reasons
not
least
of
which
is
that
even
if
the
house
could
get
a
majority
to
support
impeachment
it
likely
would
go
nowhere
in
the
republican-controlled
senate
while
there
are
varying
degrees
of
how
far
critics
of
the
president
are
willing
to
push
the
process
one
relatively
basic
litmus
test
is
whether
lawmakers
would
support
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
first
significant
step
in
the
process
of
the
democrats
in
the
house
there
are
at
least
according
to
a
cnn
count
who've
made
clear
they
support
starting
the
impeachment
inquiry
process
while
some
have
gone
further
rep
justin
amash
of
michigan
a
former
republican
who
has
since
become
an
independent
has
also
called
for
impeachment
proceedings
bringing
the
total
number
of
representatives
to
house
democrats
who
have
publicly
stated
they
at
least
support
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
rep
david
cicilline
of
rhode
island
in
advance
of
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
declining
to
show
up
for
the
house
judiciary
committee
in
may
cicilline
said
the
time
has
come
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
white
house
and
the
president
have
attempted
to
impede
our
ability
to
get
to
the
truth
we
have
a
responsibility
at
some
point
to
open
up
an
inquiry
if
this
kind
of
obstruction
interference
and
stonewalling
continues
cicilline
told
reporters
rep
ted
lieu
of
california
lieu
spoke
on
cnn
in
may
and
said
that
while
he
didn't
support
full
impeachment
he
was
among
those
democrats
supporting
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
let
me
just
be
very
clear
lieu
told
cnn's
wolf
blitzer
democrats
are
not
saying
impeachment
what
i'm
saying
and
what
some
others
are
saying
is
an
impeachment
inquiry
which
is
we
have
to
start
these
investigations
to
see
if
we
should
do
impeachment
when
blitzer
followed
to
clarify
if
lieu
supported
beginning
impeachment
procedures
but
not
full
impeachment
lieu
responded
that
is
correct
because
we
need
to
build
a
record
in
these
committees
rep
pramila
jayapal
of
washington
jayapal
spoke
on
cnn
in
may
and
tweeted
i
joined
wolfblitzer
to
discuss
how
housejudiciary
will
hold
this
president
and
his
administration
accountable
judge
mehta's
decision
was
important
but
we
still
have
to
do
our
jobs
and
uphold
the
constitution
for
me
that
means
pursuing
an
impeachment
inquiry
rep
veronica
escobar
of
texas
escobar
was
among
lawmakers
who
pushed
in
may
for
pelosi
and
nadler
to
take
a
more
aggressive
stance
than
they're
currently
taking
and
start
an
impeachment
inquiry
she
also
tweeted
i
believe
we
need
to
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry
rep
val
demings
of
florida
demings
told
cnn
last
month
that
the
evidence
contained
in
the
mueller
report
was
sufficient
for
democrats
to
take
the
next
fateful
step
i
believe
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
president
made
numerous
attempts
to
obstruct
justice
or
obstructed
justice
demings
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
told
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
the
lead
and
so
i
believe
based
on
that
information
as
i
did
a
month
ago
that
we
have
enough
to
begin
those
proceedings
rep
sheila
jackson
lee
of
texas
jackson
lee
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
told
reporters
in
may
that
she
planned
to
introduce
a
resolution
of
investigation
that
will
call
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
investigate
whether
there
is
sufficient
grounds
to
move
forward
with
impeachment
rep
john
yarmuth
of
kentucky
yarmuth
who
is
chairman
of
the
house
budget
committee
told
reporters
in
may
i
think
it's
time
to
begin
the
proceedings
on
cnn
he
said
he's
not
alone
i
think
what
we
have
john
is
we
have
a
situation
in
which
i
think
a
growing
majority
of
our
caucus
believes
that
impeachment
is
going
to
be
inevitable
yarmuth
told
cnn's
john
berman
on
new
day
but
they
also
believe
that
we
need
to
pursue
the
investigations
that
are
going
on
to
make
sure
that
certain
conduct
of
the
administration
and
the
president
that
they
need
to
be
held
accountable
for
is
discovered
rep
steve
cohen
of
tennessee
cohen
who
is
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
has
long
been
a
proponent
of
impeachment
and
introduced
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
in
november
the
time
has
come
to
make
clear
to
the
american
people
and
to
this
president
that
his
train
of
injuries
to
our
constitution
must
be
brought
to
an
end
through
impeachment
cohen
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
i
believe
there
is
evidence
that
he
attempted
to
obstruct
an
investigation
into
russia's
interference
with
the
u.s.
presidential
election
and
links
between
between
russia
and
the
trump
campaign
most
notably
the
firing
of
fbi
director
james
comey
rep
al
green
of
texas
green
was
the
first
house
democrat
to
formally
seek
trump's
impeachment
from
the
house
floor
in
comments
he
made
in
may
this
is
about
my
position
this
is
about
what
i
believe
and
this
is
where
i
stand
i
will
not
be
moved
the
president
must
be
impeached
green
said
at
the
time
for
those
who
do
not
know
impeachment
does
not
mean
that
the
president
would
be
found
guilty
it
simply
means
that
the
house
of
representatives
will
bring
charges
against
the
president
it's
similar
to
an
indictment
but
not
quite
the
same
thing
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
of
new
york
in
a
series
of

ocasio-cortez
said

robert
mueller's

mueller's

is
clear
in
pointing
to
congress
responsibility
in
investigating
obstruction
of
justice
by
the
president
it
is
our
job
as
outlined
in

beyer
said
endorsing
such
a
course
is
not
easy
and
i
do
not
do
so
lightly
but
i
believe
that
the
president
has
left
congress
no
other
option
but
to
pursue
it

the

diana
degette

degette
released
a
statement
backing

the

details
many
instances
in
which
president
trump
actively
attempted
to
interfere
with
the
investigation
into
his
campaign's
potentially
treasonous
ties
with

she
stated
the
president's
actions
are
clearly
beneath
the
high
personal
ethical
and
legal
standards
our
founders
envisioned
in
the
executive
branch
and
as
such
constitute
a
prima

trigger
an
impeachment
investigation

mark
pocan
of
wisconsin
pocan
released
a
statement
supporting
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
in
may
stonewalling
congress
on
witnesses
and
the
unredacted
mueller
report
only
enhances
the
president's
appearance
of
guilt
and
as
a
result
he
has
pushed
congress
to
a
point
where
we
must
start
an
impeachment
inquiry
pocan
said
rep
earl
blumenauer
of
oregon
blumenauer
released
a
statement
in
early
may
backing
the
start
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
mueller
investigation
was
limited
in
its
capacity
to
take
action
and
draw
conclusions
due
to
justice
department
guidelines
he
wrote
yet
it
was
a
treasure
trove
of
information
that
deserves
further
investigation
which
should
be
done
in
the
house
the
only
chamber
willing
to
hold
this
president
accountable
for
that
reason
i
am
joining
congresswoman
tlaib
in
calling
for
the
judiciary
committee
to
carry
out
a
formal
investigation
regarding
potential
impeachable
offenses
by
donald
trump
rep
madeleine
dean
of
pennsylvania
dean
a
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
told
cnn
in
an
interview
in
may
that
she
supported
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
we
can't
just
constantly
put
out
lawful
subpoena
try
to
do
our
constitutional
oversight
be
stonewalled
by
an
administration
that's
just
simply
trying
to
cover
up
bad
behaviors
and
not
change
course
dean
said
and
so
what
we've
been
trying
to
do
is
investigative
oversight
i
believe
at
the
point
you
have
barr
fail
to
come
forward
and
produce
documents
you
have
mcgahn
fail
to
produce
documents
and
come
forward
enough's
enough
it's
time
to
begin
an
investigation
an
inquiry
as
to
impeachment
rep
dwight
evans
of
pennsylvania
evans
has
openly
supported
steps
toward
impeachment
since
trump's
first
year
in
office
in
december
he
released
a
statement
explaining
his
vote
not
to
table
a
house
resolution
calling
for
impeachment
after
being
in
congress
for
over
a
year
and
observing
president
trump's
questionable
actions
i
strongly
believe
there
should
at
least
be
a
discussion
about
whether
or
not
president
trump's
actions
met
the
bar
of
impeachment
evans
stated
in
february
evans
was
co-host
of
an
event
on
the
party
to
impeach
tour
with
billionaire
tom
steyer
who
has
long
publicly
advocated
impeaching
trump
the
president
is
not
above
the
constitution
evans
told
philly

at
the
time
he
needs
to
be
held
accountable
my
constituents
have
raised
serious
concerns
about
the
president's
actions
rep
jared
huffman
of
california
huffman
signed
on
to
efforts
to
start
impeachment
proceedings
in
december
impeachment
is
an
extraordinary
measure
but
it
should
be
clear
to
anyone
who
examines
the
facts
that
president
trump's
actions
justify
his
impeachment
including
his
efforts
to
obstruct
justice
his
self-enrichment
and
serial
violations
of
the
emoluments
clause
and
his
involvement
in
a
cover-up
stemming
from
his
campaign's
very
likely
collusion
with
russian
interests
to
undermine
the
presidential
election

said
in

statement
at
the
time

moulton

is
running

nomination
for

said
earlier
this
year
that

supported
moving
forward
with
impeachment
proceedings
i
voted
on
this
a
over
a
year
ago
and
i
said
that
proceedings
should
move
forward
he
told
reporters
at
a
campaign
stop
on
april
in
manchester
new
hampshire
moulton
was
careful
to
note
it's
not
the
right
time
to
vote
on
impeachment
because
we
don't
have
all
the
facts
in
we
don't
even
have
the
full
version
of
the
mueller
report
but
we
absolutely
should
move
forward
on
the
proceedings
so
we
can
have
this
debate
in
congress
and
frankly
i
think
it's
long
overdue
rep

omar
of

omar
has
called
for
some
form
of
impeachment
proceedings
against

since
before

congress
in
january
we
know
that
this
president
this
administration
every
day
has
gone
a
little
bit
closer
to
being
impeached
we
won't
be
having
these
conversations
on
whether
to
do
it
but
it's
going
to
be
when
and
how
omar
told
cnn
in
december
more
recently
she's
signed
petitions
to
start
impeachment
proceedings

well
as

that
dependent
on

vote
that
we
follow
up
procedurally
in
committee
pressley
told
boston
public
radio
on
april
i
mean
here's
the
thing
i

felt

has
lost
all
moral

there
are
many
impeachable
offenses

earliest
advocates

signing

recent
disclosures

campaign
was
eager
to
receive
assistance
from
russia
sherman
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
it
now
seems
likely
that
the
president
had
something
to
hide
when
he
tried
to
curtail
the
investigation
of
national
security
advisor
michael
flynn
and
the
wider
russian
probe
i
believe
his
conversations
with

subsequent
firing
of

james
comey
constitute
obstruction
of
justice
rep

bonamici
released
a
statement
in
may
supporting
the
start
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
i
am
gravely
concerned
about
the
actions
of
president
trump
and
the
growing
evidence
of
possible
impeachable
offenses
including
obstruction
of
justice
committing
human
rights
violations
by
separating
children
from
their
families
and
profiting
from
the
presidency
bonamici
said
in
the
statement
i've
said
before
that
impeachment
should
be
an
option
but
we
must
approach
it
deliberately
the
time
has
come
rep
marcia
fudge
of

fudge

long
been
a
supporter
of
starting
impeachment

in
november
she
joined
cohen's
introduction
of
articles
of
impeachment
in
the
nearly
days
since
he
was
sworn
in
it
has
become
evident
that
president
trump
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
our
democracy
it
is
high
time
that
congress
take
a
serious
look
at
the
president's
actions
fudge
said
in
a
statement
from
cohen's
office
if
those
actions
are
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution
then
the
congress
of
the
united
states
needs
to
do
the
job
the
american
people
elected
us
to
do
rep
gwen

of

moore
has
long
said
she
supports
starting
impeachment
proceedings
telling
local
reporters
in
her
home
district
in
august
yeah
i
think
so
i
think
i'm
there
when
asked
by
wisn-
if
she
wanted
to
see
trump
impeached
she
also
tweeted
in
august
my
republican
friends
i
implore
you
to
work
w
us
within
our
capacity
as
elected
officials
to
remove
realdonaldtrump
as
potus
impeach
more
recently
she
tweeted
in
february
that
trump
declaring
a
national
emergency
to
start
construction
on
a
border
wall
would
be
grounds
for
impeachment
a
step
trump
later
took
rep
norma
torres
of
california
torres
told
the
washington
post
in
april
that
i
think
there
is
enough
evidence
in
front
of
us
to
move
forward
on
impeachment
proceedings
and
that
if
it
came
up
for
a
vote
today
i
would
vote
to
impeach
this
president
in
a
story
headlined
how
the
mueller
report
convinced
this
house
democrat
that
trump
should
be
impeached
torres
said
that
congress
and
trump
are
at
a
stalemate
and
not
able
to
focus
on
the
issues
this
president
took
an
oath
of
office
to
uphold
the
constitution
and
he's
violated
that
torres
told
the
post
he's
violated
the
spirit
of
the
law
we
need
to
hold
him
accountable
rep

vargas
told
the
nbc

in
san
diego
in

that
the
reality
is
he
broke
the
law
and
he
should
be
impeached
rep
danny
davis
of
illinois
davis
said
in
a
statement
in
may
before
mueller's
spoke
publicly
i
believe
it
is
time
and
imperative
that
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry
whether
the
house
of
representatives
should
impeach
donald
john
trump
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
to
that
end
i
will
be
requesting
that
my
name
be
added
as
a
co-sponsor
of
h.
res
it
is
my
hope
that
the
house
will
move
forward
in
as
unified
and
non-partisan
manner
as
possible
but
will
not
be
dissuaded
by
purely
political
opposition

the

homeland
security
committee
posted
on

after
mueller's
remarks
in
late
may
i
support
impeachment
the
president
has
egregiously
obstructed
justice
his
statement
also
cited
mueller's
comment
that
if
we
had
confidence
that
the
president
clearly
did
not
commit
a
crime
we
would
have
said
so
rep

mcgovern
of
massachusetts
mcgovern
chairman
of
the
house
rules
committee
said
on
boston
radio
station
wgbh's
podcast
in
may
that
he
believed
it
was
time
to
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry
i
believe
quite
frankly
that
the
next
step
is
for
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
open
an
inquiry
to
formally
begin
considering
whether
impeachment
is
warranted
i
think
we're
at
that
point
and
i
think
that
to
me
seems
like
a
logical
way
to
proceed
he
noted
that
he
had
backed
an
impeachment
inquiry
when
the
house
voted
on
it
in
but
said
he
hadn't
been
vocal
about
doing
so
in
the
current
congress
until
now

malinowski
explained
to

star-ledger
in
late
may
why
he
supports
moving
forward
with
impeachment
proceedings
nobody
knows
what
the
political
impact
will
be
and
therefore
it
is
a
risk
but
when
in
doubt
it's
probably
best
to
do
the
right
thing
rep
adriano
espaillat
of
new
york
espaillat
explained
to
cnn's
poppy
harlow
and
jim
sciutto
why
he
favors
impeachment
saying
he
felt
the
threshold
for
impeachment
was
met
some
time
ago
over
the
emoluments
issue
we
must
as
duly
elected
members
of
congress
exercise
our
duties
entrusted
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
he
said
in
late
may
the
day
after
mueller's
public
remarks
rep
brendan
boyle
of
pennsylvania
in
an
interview
in
may
with
cnn's
kate
bolduan
boyle
said
he's
ready
to
start
holding
impeachment
hearings
given
that
the
special
counsel
is
now
officially
concluded
and
is
now
resigning
i
believe
that
the
ball
is
clearly
in
our
court
he
said
i've
called
not
for
a
rush
to
vote
on
impeachment
but
the
official
beginning
of
impeachment
hearings
so
that
way
we
can
go
through
what's
in
the
report
we
can
further
investigate
where
the
report
didn't
go
rep

stanton
a

said
in

in

it
is

move
to
the
next
stages
of
holding

accountable
including
the
extraordinary
step
of
opening
an

inquiry
stanton
said
this
is
a
conclusion
i
reached
only
recently
and
not
one
i
reached
lightly
rep

rep

in
an

in

with

on

mccollum
explained
why
she
is
in
favor
of
impeachment
we
have
every
right
to
get
to
the
truth
because
the
president
is
not
above
the
law
so
we
need
to
be
able
to
do
our
work
mccollum
said
adding
that
is
why
many
of
us
are
saying
that
we
have
to
look
at
impeachment
because
trump
has
snubbed
his
nose
at
congress
being
able

do
its

the
regular

being

open

understand

should
begin

process
if

still

foreign

and
not
report
it

impeachment
is
the
most
extraordinary
remedy
the
constitution
affords
congress
swalwell
told
reporters
as
a
former
prosecutor
i
do
not
take
this
lightly
but
the
president
continues
to
put
his
own
interests
above
america's
he
is
lawless
his
relentless
attacks
on
our
rule
of
law
and
numerous
efforts
to
obstruct
justice
and
congress
have
reached
such
a
point
to
require
extraordinary
action

rep

actions
described

oversight
have
led
him
to
no
other
choice
i
have
been
reluctant

use
the
tool
of

and
have
always
viewed
impeachment
as
a
tool
of
last
resort
kildee
said
in
a
statement
but
the

actions

a

defend

he
said
follow
a
timeline
far
too
slow
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
american
people
for
truth
and
justice
i
have
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
mr
trump's
activities
and
inform
the
public
about
what
we
learn
is
to
centralize

as
to
why

also
pursuing

in

gives

firmer
legal
ground
on
which
to
stand

an

inquiry
is
a
process
not
an

i
fear
there
is
no
amount
of
wrongdoing
that
we
could
uncover
that
would
convince

republicans

hold
the

accountable

that

chu
said
in

the

be
deliberate
and

we
have
a
sacred
duty
as

to
ensure
that
nobody
is
above
the
law
to
do
nothing
given
what
we
know
is
unacceptable
rep
nita
lowey
of

lowey
announced
on
july
that
mueller's
report
shed
light
on
the
depths
of
systemic
deception
that
appears
to
be
second
nature
for
the
president
and
his
advisors
the
house
judiciary
committee
should
move
forward
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
lowey
said
in
a
statement
rep
ted
deutch
of
florida
a
spokesperson
for
deutch's
office
told
cnn
on
august
that
he
would
vote
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
while
he
believes
we
are
already
in
one
he
would
support
opening
one
if
it
required
a
vote
which
he
doesn't
believe
it
does
the
spokesperson
said
this
followed
an
editorial
deutch
wrote
in
the
south
florida
sun
sentinel
newspaper
which
said
the
question
is
no
longer
whether
the
house
should
vote
to
proceed
with
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
the
inquiry
has
already
begun
rep
pete
aguilar
of
california
aguilar
made
his
announcement
in
a
statement
august
no
american
is
above
the
law
he
said
in
the
statement
after
careful
consideration
and
conversations
with
members
of
my
community
i
believe
it
is
time
for
the
house
to
begin
proceedings
to
determine
whether
the
president's
conduct
meets
the
standards
of
impeachment
rep
salud
carbajal
of
california
i
believe
strongly
in
bipartisanship
my
time
in
public
service
from
the
marines
to
local
government
to
representing
the
central
coast
in
congress
has
been
built
on
the
ideal
that
we
can
get
more
done
if
we
work
together
than
we
ever
could
alone
i
have
worked
with
my
colleagues
across
the
aisle
to
improve
our
infrastructure
healthcare
environment
and
more
this
will
not
change
the
question
of
impeachment
goes
beyond
party
it
is
about
defending
our
democracy
and
our
constitution
the
bedrock
of
our
nation's
values
carbajal
said
in
a
statement
on
august
we
cannot
ignore
this
president's
actions
and
we
cannot
let
him
off
the
hook
because
of
his
title
i
was
elected
to
support
and
defend
our
constitution
against
all
threats
foreign
and
domestic
that
is
what
i
will
continue
to
do
rep
gerry
connolly
of

connolly
cited
both
the
mueller
report
as
well
as
trump's
behavior
following
the
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
and
his
failure
to
heal
our
country
and
call
us
to
our
better
angels
as
part
of
the
reason
for
announcing
his
support
for
starting
an
impeachment
inquiry
on
august
but
after
careful
thought
and
consideration
i
believe
the
time
has
come
for
the
house

to
begin
an
impeachment
inquiry

burnett
nadler
has
said
that
he
believes
the

has
committed
impeachable

it's
a
separate
question
whether

impeach
him
