the

cnn
the
re-emergence
of
the
controversy
surrounding
brett
kavanaugh's
confirmation
to
the
supreme
court
has
put
democrats
in
a
challenging
political
position
last
year
amid
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
that
kavanaugh
denied
the
vast
majority
of
senate
democrats
voted
against
his
confirmation
the
senate
elections
that
followed
suggest
a
cautionary
tale
for
democrats
relitigating
the
kavanaugh
nomination
heading
into
polling
models
produced
by
now
washington
post
analyst
david
byler
fivethirtyeight
and
i
found
that
the
democrats
chance
of
winning
the
senate
was
slashed
from
in
mid-to-late
september
during
the
kavanaugh
confirmation
hearings
to
by
election
day
in
terms
of
raw
seats
each
model
had
the
democrats
winning
two
to
three
more
seats
in
late
september
than
they
eventually
won
now
some
of
this
may
have
been
natural
movement
toward
the
partisan
baseline
in
red
states
like
missouri
and
indiana
but
these
forecast
models
are
supposed
to
take
into
these
baselines
indeed
the
exit
polls
suggest
that
kavanaugh
was
a
net
negative
for
democrats
across
the
senate
landscape
one
question
on
some
state
exit
polls
asked
voters
whether
a
senator's
kavanaugh
nomination
vote
was
important
to
them
in
every
state
but
one
florida
where
the
republican
senator
voted
for
kavanaugh
or
the
democratic
senator
voted
against
him
it
was
a
net
negative
for
the
democratic
senate
nominee
in
these
seven
states
all
but
one
carried
by
trump
in
those
who
said
a
senator's
kavanaugh
vote
was
important
to
their
choice
for
senate
were
far
more
likely
to
vote
republican
for
senate
in
these
states
the
republican
senate
candidates
won
by
an
average
of
points
among
those
who
said
a
senator's
kavanaugh
vote
was
important
to
them
among
those
who
said
the
kavanaugh
vote
wasn't
important
the
democratic
senate
candidate
won
by
an
average
of
points
perhaps
what's
most
interesting
is
what
the
exit
polls
found
in
west
virginia
the
state
where
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
voted
for
kavanaugh
manchin
won
by
points
more
among
those
who
said
his
kavanaugh
vote
was
important
to
whom
they
chose
for
senate
more
stunning
he
won
by
points
more
among
those
who
said
his
kavanaugh
vote
was
any
sort
of
factor
major
or
minor
in
their
senate
choice
in
other
words
you
could
make
the
argument
that
manchin's
vote
for
kavanaugh
saved
his
senate
seat
for
the
democrats
it's
at
least
a
feasible
argument
that
had
a
few
other
democrats
such
as
indiana
sen
joe
donnelly
voted
for
kavanaugh
they
might
have
also
held
onto
their
seats
too
now
what
does
all
of
this
mean
for
to
win
the
presidency
democrats
aren't
going
to
need
to
win
states
like
indiana
or
missouri
the
effect
of
kavanaugh
nationally
is
less
clear
kavanaugh
had
a
net
negative
rating
nationally
though
the
exit
polls
found
those
motivated
by
kavanaugh
were
more
republican
friendly
even
in
nevada
where
hillary
clinton
won
in
democrats
do
need
to
win
red
states
to
take
back
the
senate
democrats
need
a
pickup
of
at
least
three
seats
in
only
two
republican
held
seats
up
are
in
states
clinton
won
in
there's
also
the
one
democratic
held
seat
up
for
reelection
in
deeply
red
alabama
put
together
democrats
will
need
to
win
at
least
two
senate
seats
in
trump
won
states
to
take
back
the
senate
all
told
relitigating
kavanaugh
may
be
good
politics
for
a
democratic
presidential
primary
where
kavanaugh
is
hated
it
may
even
be
a
wash
for
democrats
in
a
presidential
general
election
it's
likely
bad
politics
for
democrats
when
trying
to
take
back
the
senate
