it's
joe
biden
vs
elizabeth
warren
round
cnn
there
will
be
democratic
presidential
candidates
onstage
thursday
night
in
houston
texas
but
all
eyes
will
be
and
should
be
on
only
two
joe
biden
and
elizabeth
warren
biden
and
warren
are
and
likely
will
continue
to
be
the
yin
and
yang
of
the
battle
to
be
the
democratic
standard-bearer
in
the
election
biden
is
establishment
incremental
and
pragmatic
warren
is
outsider
swing-for-the-fences
and
idealistic
biden
has
been
the
race's
front-runner
since
the
beginning
warren
is
rapidly
stealing
the
spotlight
from
bernie
sanders
within
the
party's
progressive
wing
they
represent
broadly
the
two
paths
before
democratic
voters
who
will
spend
the
coming
months
figuring
out
which
option
has
the
better
chance
of
defeating
president
donald
trump
and
remarkably
they've
never
shared
a
debate
stage
before
all
of
which
means
we
and
they
will
be
in
uncharted
territory
tonight
which
is
exciting
that
said
both
candidates
have
already
provided
very
clear
hints
about
what
they
view
to
be
the
other's
major
weakness
and
a
close
reading
of
those
comments
tells
us
a
lot
about
the
ground
on
which
thursday's
debate
will
be
fought
between
its
two
most
important
players
let's
start
with
how
warren
will
attack
biden
over
this
past
weekend
in
new
hampshire
all
of
the
major
candidates
including
biden
and
warren
were
in
the
state
for
its
democratic
party's
annual
convention
which
is
where
from
the
stage
and
with
thousands
of
loyal
democrats
cheering
her
every
word
warren
said
this
there
is
a
lot
at
stake
and
people
are
scared
but
we
can't
choose
a
candidate
we
don't
believe
in
because
we're
scared
if
you
think
a
that
line
was
accidental
or
b
it
wasn't
aimed
directly
at
biden's
electability
argument
there's
a
very
hot
video
company
named
blockbuster
i'd
like
to
sell
you
warren's
line
struck
me
as
a
direct
repudiation
of
jill
biden's
assertion
in
new
hampshire
last
month
that
electability
is
all
that
any
democratic
should
care
about
your
candidate
might
be
better
on
i
don't
know
health
care
than
joe
is
but
you've
got
to
look
at
who's
going
to
win
this
election
jill
biden
said
and
maybe
you
have
to
swallow
a
little
bit
and
say
ok
i
personally
like
so
and
so
better
but
your
bottom
line
has
to
be
that
we
have
to
beat
trump
what
warren
was
saying
in
essence
was
this
we
all
want
to
beat
trump
but
you
don't
have
to
compromise
your
beliefs
in
order
to
bring
about
that
outcome
don't
vote
for
someone
you
don't
believe
in
just
because
he
says
that
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
beating
trump
and
he's
the
best
person
to
do
that
but
biden
has
prepared
a
counterargument
i
expect
you'll
see
biden
echo
an
important
point
he
made
during
last
week's
climate
forum
we
need
more
than
plans
we
need
a
president
who
can
deliver
progress
on
the
most
pressing
issues
facing
americans
which
joe
biden
has
proven
he
can
throughout
his
career
a
biden
adviser
told
cnn
earlier
this
week
plans
are
not
enough
is
again
a
very
purposeful
shot
at
warren
even
though
her
name
wasn't
invoked
by
the
adviser
who
has
premised
her
entire
candidacy
on
the
idea
that
she
has
a
detailed
plan
for
anything
and
everything
biden's
team
sees
the
contrast
between
his
years
of
fighting
and
winning
political
battles
and
warren's
years
spent
in
academia
and
her
relative
lack
of
legislative
accomplishments
during
her
seven
years
in
the
senate
one
of
these
two
candidates
has
done
things
and
one
has
talked
about
what
she
would
do
goes
the
biden
argument
now
it's
possible
that
biden
and
warren
will
decide
that
tonight
is
not
the
right
time
to
air
these
attacks
in
front
of
millions
of
people
watching
on
tv
or
that
a
moment
never
presents
itself
where
the
hits
feel
like
they
make
sense
but
make
no
mistake
these
are
the
two
defining
contrasts
of
the
democratic
primary
fight
unless
and
until
some
other
candidate
kamala
harris
and
pete
buttigieg
being
the
most
likely
options
shows
that
they
belong
in
the
top
tier
doing
vs
talking
voting
from
fear
vs
voting
for
hope
insider
vs
outsider
a
return
to
normal
vs
large
structural
change
this
is
the
fulcrum
on
which
the
fight
for
the
hearts
and
minds
of
democratic
voters
will
pivot
and
that
battle
likely
will
begin
in
earnest
tonight
