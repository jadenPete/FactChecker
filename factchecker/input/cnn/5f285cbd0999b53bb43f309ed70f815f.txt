attorney
for
mccabe
asks
prosecutors
if
grand
jury
has
declined
to
bring
charges
washington

the
attorney
for
former
fbi
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
asked
federal
prosecutors
late
thursday
if
a
grand
jury
in
washington
dc
had
declined
to
bring
charges
against
their
client
following
a
report
in
the
washington
post
of
possible
grand
jury
activity
in
an
email
obtained
by
cnn
attorney
michael
bromwich
says
that
based
on
discussions
he'd
had
with
prosecutors
in
the
case
that
it
is
clear
mccabe
has
not
so
far
been
indicted
and
asks
the
us
attorney
jessie
liu
to
drop
any
plan
to
resubmit
the
case
to
a
different
grand
jury
if
in
fact
the
case
had
been
denied
by
the
first
it
is
rare
for
a
grand
jury
to
decline
to
bring
an
indictment
after
federal
prosecutors
produce
a
full
case
to
them
and
any
such
decision
could
be
an
indication
of
the
weakness
of
the
evidence
the
government
has
presented
no
grand
jury
indictments
were
presented
thursday
at
a
daily
hearing
in
the
downtown
courthouse
where
such
indictments
are
typically
discussed
since
wednesday
only
one
grand
jury
indictment
unrelated
to
mccabe
has
been
returned
in
dc
federal
court
grand
juries
conduct
their
business
in
secret
and
cnn
has
not
reported
about
any
unusual
grand
jury
activity
involving
mccabe
this
week
mccabe
is
a
cnn
contributor
cnn
reported
thursday
that
the
justice
department
had
rebuffed
an
attempt
by
mccabe
to
stave
off
an
indictment
in
a
case
involving
false
statements
he
allegedly
made
to
investigators
in
an
email
a
senior
justice
department
official
notified
mccabe's
legal
team
that
they
rejected
an
appeal
mccabe
had
made
of
the
recommendation
by
liu
to
bring
an
indictment
the
department
rejected
your
appeal
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office's
decision
in
this
matter
any
further
inquiries
should
be
directed
to
the
united
states
attorney's
office
the
doj
official
wrote
according
to
a
source
close
to
mccabe's
legal
team
the
us
attorney
recommended
mccabe
be
indicted
after
investigating
a
referral
from
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
that
reported
mccabe
had
made
false
statements
to
investigators
regarding
his
involvement
in
a
wall
street
journal
story
about
an
investigation
into
the
clinton
foundation
published
days
before
the
presidential
election
mccabe
an
early
target
of
president
donald
trump
has
said
that
he
never
intentionally
misled
anyone
and
he
later
corrected
his
statements
to
investigators
his
attorneys
say
that
any
charges
against
him
would
be
driven
by
politics
and
retaliation
from
trump
for
the
fbi's
scrutiny
of
his
administration
mccabe
who
served
as
the
acting
fbi
director
after
james
comey
was
fired
opened
the
fbi's
obstruction
of
justice
investigation
into
the
president
before
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller
was
appointed
if
mccabe
were
to
be
indicted
it
would
represent
a
rare
step
against
a
senior
law
enforcement
official
and
the
first
set
of
charges
against
an
official
involved
in
the
investigations
into
trump
as
the
president
has
waged
a
crusade
to
discredit
them
prosecutors
must
only
convince
grand
jurors
that
there
was
probably
cause
that
a
crime
was
committed
and
of
grand
jurors
are
required
to
sign
off
on
an
indictment
for
it
to
be
handed
up
it's
unclear
how
long
prosecutors
in
washington
have
been
bringing
evidence
and
witnesses
before
a
grand
jury
to
build
their
case
against
mccabe
but
grand
jurors
heard
from
at
least
one
witness
that
would
have
undercut
the
justice
department's
attempts
to
build
a
case
around
a
false
statements
charge
lisa
page
a
former
senior
aide
to
mccabe
and
the
official
he
directed
to
disclose
information
about
the
clinton
foundation
probe
to
the
newspaper
told
a
grand
jury
that
mccabe
had
no
motive
to
lie
about
the
disclosure
because
he
was
authorized
as
the
fbi's
number
two
to
make
them
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
situation
