pitches
anti-corruption
plan
new
york
cnn
sen
elizabeth
warren
touted
her
sweeping
new
set
of
anti-corruption
proposals
at
a
rally
monday
night
in
new
york
where
she
spoke
a
short
walk
from
the
site
of
an
infamous
fire
that
set
off
a
movement
to
regulate
workplace
safety
standards
addressing
thousands
of
supporters
in
washington
square
park
the
massachusetts
democrat
connected
the
mix
of
populist
rage
and
insider
activist
politicking
that
followed
the
deadly
blaze
at
the
triangle
shirtwaist
factory
and
led
to
the
passage
of
a
raft
of
new
labor
laws
to
her
broader
vision
for
eradicating
corruption
in
washington
warren
told
the
story
through
the
lens
of
frances
perkins
who
led
the
charge
for
change
in
new
york
before
going
on
to
become
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt's
labor
secretary
the
first
woman
to
hold
a
cabinet
position
and
an
author
of
the
new
deal
perkins
used
the
same
model
that
she
and
her
friends
had
used
after
the
triangle
fire
she
worked
the
political
system
relentlessly
from
the
inside
while
a
sustained
movement
applied
pressure
from
the
outside
warren
said
monday
night
as
frances
perkins
put
it
the
triangle
fire
was
the
day
the
new
deal
was
born
warren's
push
to
combat
public
corruption
by
implementing
stricter
ethics
laws
has
been
the
central
theme
of
her
presidential
campaign
underlying
that
argument
has
been
a
promise
to
work
an
inside-outside
model
of
politics
connecting
progressive
activists
with
like-minded
lawmakers
her
message
got
a
boost
ahead
of
the
speech
with
introductions
from
democratic
new
york
state
sen
alessandra
biaggi
and
working
families
party
national
director
maurice
mitchell
whose
group
had
endorsed
warren
earlier
in
the
day
in
a
rare
round
of
prepared
remarks
warren
channeled
the
women-led
organizing
that
followed
the
triangle
shirtwaist
fire
a
story
she
said
about
power
its
abuses
and
organized
opposition
to
make
a
modern
case
for
undertaking
radical
anti-corruption
measures
in
washington
climate
change
gun
safety
health
care
on
the
face
of
it
these
three
are
totally
different
issues
but
despite
our
being
the
strongest
and
wealthiest
country
in
the
history
of
the
world
our
democracy
is
paralyzed
warren
said
and
why
because
giant
corporations
have
bought
off
our
government
the
measures
she
unveiled
earlier
monday
warren
argued
would
go
a
long
way
in
breaking
that
grip
she
proposed
banning
federal
lawmakers
and
their
senior
staff
from
serving
on
corporate
boards
and
requiring
every
new
member
of
congress
to
make
public
any
potential
financial
conflicts
before
they
take
office
corporate
lobbyists
would
have
to
wait
six
years
before
becoming
eligible
for
government
jobs
and
a
range
of
other
powerful
officials
from
the
president
to
federal
judges
and
cabinet
secretaries
would
be
permanently
disqualified
from
working
as
lobbyists
after
leaving
office
warren's
remarks
in
new
york
were
the
first
she's
delivered
off
a
teleprompter
since
her
campaign
kickoff
in
lawrence
massachusetts
earlier
this
year
they
also
picked
up
a
similar
theme
an
urgent
call
to
action
using
the
story
of
activism
driven
by
women
in
that
case
the
bread
and
roses
textile
workers
strike
of
elizabeth
warren
kicks
off
presidential
bid
with
challenge
to
super
wealthy
and
other
democrats
we're
not
here
today
because
of
famous
arches
or
famous
men
in
fact
we're
not
here
because
of
men
at
all
warren
said
monday
we're
here
because
of
some
hardworking
women
she
added
before
telling
in
vivid
detail
the
story
of
the
triangle
shirtwaist
disaster
this
latest
round
of
proposals
builds
on
an
already
extensive
set
of
suggested
overhauls
to
how
the
government
regulates
big
corporations
and
itself
in
both
the
new
rollout
and
her
speech
warren
argues
that
without
tightening
anti-corruption
laws
and
tying
down
big
money
interests
the
policies
favored
by
most
progressives
are
doomed
to
defeat
in
washington
to
untie
that
knot
she
would
impose
a
slate
of
new
rules
designed
to
end
lobbying
as
we
know
it
by
creating
a
broader
definition
of
the
kinds
of
activities
that
would
fall
under
the
title
and
in
a
specific
reference
to
the
work
done
by
trump
campaign
chair
paul
manafort
warren
proposes
banning
private
lobbying
on
behalf
of
foreign
governments
her
plan
calls
for
limiting
lobbyists
influence
on
domestic
elections
by
forbidding
them
from
making
political
contributions
acting
as
bundlers
or
helping
to
pool
other
people's
donations
and
hosting
fundraisers
for
candidates
the
industry
more
generally
would
also
be
governed
by
new
regulations
on
the
amount
it
can
spend
to
influence
elected
officials
and
be
forced
to
pay
a
tax
on
annual
expenditures
over
allowing
individuals
who
are
paid
to
influence
government
officials
on
policy
to
also
give
gifts
or
funnel
money
to
the
political
campaigns
of
those
same
officials
sounds
like
legalized
bribery
warren
wrote
in
a
medium
post
on
the
government
side
she
wants
to
establish
a
federal
office
of
the
public
advocate
which
she
said
in
her
post
would
engage
the
public
in
a
more
substantial
way
when
regulatory
rules
are
being
negotiated
or
become
subject
to
change
additionally
warren
is
pushing
for
new
mechanisms
to
enforce
ethics
rules
and
punish
violations
by
creating
what
she's
calling
the
us
office
of
public
integrity
which
would
be
empowered
to
investigate
potential
ethical
breaches
by
government
officials
in
her
medium
post
she
connected
the
need
for
more
robust
enforcement
back
to
the
trump
white
house's
habit
of
ignoring
watchdog
warnings
and
recommendations
when
secretary
ben
carson
was
warned
about
his
son
participating
in
fancy
government
events
he
brushed
it
off
warren
writes
and
when
an
independent
federal
ethics
watchdog
determined
that
kellyanne
conway
should
be
fired
for
repeatedly
violating
federal
law
the
administration
barely
cared
warren
and
sanders
say
americans
don't
like
their
health
insurance
polls
don't
back
that
up
in
her
speech
warren
described
their
boss
president
donald
trump
as
corruption
in
the
flesh
in
her
post
she
also
took
aim
at
another
trump
retired
federal
appellate
judge
maryanne
trump
barry
whose
departure
from
the
bench
ended
an
investigation
into
whether
she
had
broken
judicial
conduct
rules
by
committing
tax
fraud
under
my
plan
warren
wrote
investigations
will
remain
open
until
their
findings
are
made
public
and
any
penalties
for
misconduct
are
issued
this
latest
warren
plan
one
of
her
most
in-depth
to
date
would
also
seek
to
change
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
an
official
act
when
it
comes
to
law
enforcement
dealings
with
potential
or
suspected
pay-to-play
schemes
warren
called
the
supreme
court
ruling
in
mcdonnell
v
united
states
which
overturned
the
conviction
of
republican
former
virginia
gov
bob
mcdonnell
on
corruption
charges
wrong-headed
and
pledged
to
seek
legislation
sharpening
the
rules
the
precedent
set
by
the
decision
has
made
it
more
difficult
for
prosecutors
to
prove
similar
allegations
in
court
warren's
proposal
would
again
seek
to
impose
a
more
comprehensive
standard
for
what
could
be
considered
bribery
of
elected
officials
and
eliminate
what
she
calls
a
tractor-sized
loophole
in
the
law
the
result
she
wrote
would
be
to
ensure
that
corrupt
politicians
who
accept
bribes
can
be
prosecuted
it
also
clarifies
that
a
stream
of
benefits
rather
than
a
single
act
qualifies
as
an
unlawful
benefit
paid
in
exchange
for
a
bribe
