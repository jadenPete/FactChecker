trump
vows
to
protect
foreign
real
estate
investors
from
america's
homeless
should
homeless
be
allowed
to
sleep
on
public
streets
cnn
most
of
donald
trump's
political
career
has
been
spent
promising
to
protect
american
citizens
from
immigrants
so
it
was
odd
to
hear
him
stand
up
for
foreign
real
estate
investors
tuesday
as
he
considers
a
crackdown
on
american
homelessness
we
can't
let
los
angeles
san
francisco
and
numerous
other
cities
destroy
themselves
by
allowing
what's
happening
and
i'm
speaking
to
tenants
in
some
cases
foreign
people
foreign
tenants
but
they
have
where
they're
tenants
in
buildings
throughout
various
cities
in
california
and
other
places
where
they
want
to
leave
the
country
they
can't
believe
what's
happening
trump
told
reporters
traveling
with
him
on
his
way
to
a
fundraiser
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
yale
graduate
and
former
wall
street
banker
is
now
homeless
homelessness
is
a
huge
problem
particularly
on
the
west
coast
it's
also
where
the
trump
organization
owns
real
estate
including
a
share
of
california
street
one
of
the
tallest
buildings
in
san
francisco
trump
said
tuesday
that
homelessness
is
hurting
real
estate
investment
because
he
said
foreign
investors
want
to
leave
the
us
we
have
people
living
in
our
best
highways
our
best
streets
our
best
entrances
to
buildings
and
pay
tremendous
taxes
where
people
in
those
buildings
pay
tremendous
taxes
where
they
went
to
those
locations
because
of
the
prestige
he
said
but
what
exactly
he'll
do
remains
something
of
a
mystery
although
there
are
some
clues
during
a
call
with
reporters
monday
the
acting
head
of
the
council
of
economic
advisers
tom
philipson
said
policing
may
be
an
important
tool
to
help
them
get
off
the
street
the
federal
government
does
not
generally
police
us
cities
that's
a
role
left
to
local
governments
the
specter
of
a
federal
police
force
entering
california
to
deal
with
homelessness
would
cause
all
sorts
of
problems
especially
since
cities
in
that
state
have
already
pledged
to
be
sanctuaries
from
federal
agents
cracking
down
under
trump
on
undocumented
immigrants
philipson
made
the
comments
about
policing
as
the
administration
released
a
new
report
on
its
view
of
homelessness
particularly
in
california
where
a
large
portion
of
the
country's
unsheltered
homeless
people
live
the
main
policy
proposal
the
report
suggested
was
to
deregulate
housing
markets
which
the
report
argued
would
lower
housing
prices
trump
signed
an
executive
order
in
june
that
creates
a
new
council
under
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
ben
carson
that
would
explore
ways
to
change
building
regulations
and
zoning
laws
to
make
houses
cheaper
the
administration's
report
on
homelessness
also
suggested
that
places
with
so-called
right
to
shelter
laws
have
higher
rates
of
homelessness
and
argued
these
laws
are
counterproductive
the
washington
post
also
reported
tuesday
his
administration
is
looking
at
abandoned
government
facilities
as
an
option
to
house
homeless
people
trump
promised
action
on
the
homelessness
issue
before
his
trip
out
west
we
are
going
to
have
to
step
in
and
do
something
about
it
he
told
a
gathering
of
house
republicans
in
baltimore
last
week
we
can't
allow
it
and
in
the
not
too
distant
future
you
are
going
to
see
we
are
going
to
step
in
trump
in
saudis
buy
apartments
from
me
trump's
involvement
with
foreign
interests
in
his
buildings
is
well
documented
and
perhaps
to
be
expected
in
the
world
of
high-priced
real
estate
he
talked
in
about
selling
apartments
in
his
buildings
to
saudi
arabians
i
get
along
great
with
all
of
them
trump
said
of
the
saudis
at
a
campaign
rally
in
mobile
alabama
they
buy
apartments
from
me
they
spend
million
million
am
i
supposed
to
dislike
them
i
like
them
very
much
he's
also
once
bragged
about
making
a
huge
profit
when
he
sold
a
florida
mansion
to
a
russian
billionaire
this
isn't
the
first
time
a
trump
concern
with
the
poor
has
coincided
with
a
family
business
interest
in
the
tax
law
passed
in
republicans
and
the
trump
administration
sought
to
spur
investment
in
poor
areas
by
giving
tax
breaks
in
so-called
opportunity
zones
that
provision
was
pushed
by
presidential
son-in-law
and
adviser
jared
kushner
who
owns
an
interest
in
a
real
estate
company
making
use
of
them
a
cnn
review
in
showed
investments
in
opportunity
zones
do
not
always
focus
on
poor
areas
