justice
department
to
reveal
name
of
individual
accused
of
aiding
hijackers
washington
cnn
the
justice
department
will
reveal
the
name
of
an
individual
believed
to
be
connected
to
the
saudi
government
and
accused
of
aiding
two
of
the
hijackers
prosecutors
said
in
a
court
filing
thursday
the
person's
identity
will
remain
a
closely
guarded
secret
for
now
though
it
will
be
shared
with
attorneys
representing
the
families
of
victims
of
the
attacks
who
have
alleged
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
helped
to
coordinate
the
terrorists
in
a
lawsuit
the
attorneys
can
then
petition
the
justice
department
to
release
the
name
wider
the
move
to
disclose
the
name
came
a
day
after
the
th
anniversary
of
the
attack
which
left
nearly
men
and
women
dead
and
followed
intense
deliberation
at
the
top
of
the
justice
department
that
the
disclosure
came
under
president
donald
trump
is
especially
striking
given
the
administration's
efforts
to
maintain
close
relations
with
the
powerful
arab
ally
including
by
downplaying
the
kingdom's
involvement
in
the
recent
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
attorney
general
william
barr
made
the
final
decision
a
justice
department
official
said
while
the
saudis
have
continually
denied
any
government
involvement
in
the
attacks
their
role
has
been
the
subject
of
dispute
in
washington
fifteen
of
the
al
qaeda
terrorists
who
hijacked
four
planes
on
september
were
saudi
nationals
the
commission
established
by
congress
said
in
that
it
had
found
no
evidence
that
the
saudi
government
as
an
institution
or
senior
saudi
officials
individually
funded
al
qaeda
although
a
number
of
commission
members
have
since
said
including
in
declarations
that
were
submitted
as
part
of
the
lawsuit
that
the
review
did
not
include
an
exhaustive
investigation
of
evidence
of
possible
saudi
government
involvement
the
name
the
justice
department
plans
to
release
comes
from
a
four-page
summary
from
of
an
fbi
investigation
into
three
people
who
were
said
to
help
find
living
quarters
and
provide
financial
assistance
as
well
as
assistance
in
obtaining
flight
lessons
and
driver's
licenses
to
two
of
the
hijackers
in
southern
california
in
the
period
before
the
attack
two
of
the
names
are
already
known
from
a
version
of
the
document
that
is
publicly
available
though
the
third
name
has
remained
redacted
the
two
men
fahad
al-thumairy
and
omar
ahmed
al-bayoumi
have
been
connected
to
the
saudi
government
previously
in
government
reports
attorneys
for
the
families
have
argued
that
the
unnamed
individual
is
likely
a
more
senior
saudi
official
and
point
to
a
portion
of
the
document
where
the
fbi
said
a
person
whose
name
is
redacted
tasked
al-thumairy
and
al-bayoumi
with
assisting
the
hijackers
in
a
statement
the
fbi
said
it
decided
to
declassify
and
provide
the
attorneys
with
the
name
in
light
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
an
official
added
that
the
information
in
the
report
about
the
unnamed
individual
referred
to
an
investigative
theory
pursued
by
the
fbi
at
the
time
and
not
a
statement
of
fact
the
decision
to
release
the
document
to
the
plaintiffs
in
the
suit
was
coordinated
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
department
of
justice
prosecutors
wrote
in
a
court
filing
last
week
if
the
justice
department
had
claimed
they
could
not
release
the
document
under
the
state
secrets
privilege
which
allows
the
government
to
prevent
the
disclosure
of
sensitive
information
that
might
endanger
national
security
barr
himself
would
have
had
to
submit
an
affidavit
making
the
claim
families
of
the
victims
have
been
attempting
to
sue
the
country
as
far
back
as
and
in
as
part
of
their
lawsuit
were
allowed
to
proceed
with
discovery
that
was
only
allowed
after
congress
passed
a
law
in
widening
the
ability
for
civil
lawsuits
to
be
filed
against
foreign
countries
accused
of
involvement
in
a
terror
attack
the
law
was
vetoed
by
president
barack
obama
that
year
who
said
it
would
expose
us
diplomats
and
servicemen
to
litigation
in
other
countries
but
congress
overrode
the
veto
attorneys
representing
family
members
of
almost
all
of
the
victims
as
well
as
thousands
of
survivors
last
year
sent
subpoenas
to
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
the
fbi
cia
and
state
department
and
have
been
receiving
hundreds
of
pages
of
documents
on
a
rolling
basis
