trump
speaks
in
baltimore
for
the
first
time
since
calling
it
a
rodent
infested
mess
cummings
here's
what
bothers
me
the
most
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
addressed
the
house
republican
conference
member
retreat
dinner
in
baltimore
thursday
evening
his
first
time
visiting
the
city
since
he
called
it
a
rat
and
rodent
infested
mess
trump
tweeted
his
comments
in
july
specifically
referring
to
democratic
rep
elijah
cummings
district
which
includes
parts
of
baltimore
as
a
place
where
no
human
being
would
want
to
live
trump
began
his
speech
thursday
as
the
same
time
the
democratic
presidential
lineup
took
the
stage
in
texas
for
their
debate
promising
fellow
republicans
a
new
substantial
tax
cut
for
middle
income
americans
next
year
and
teasing
new
administration
standards
that
will
save
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
per
car
we're
working
on
a
tax
cut
for
the
middle
income
people
that
is
going
to
be
very
very
inspirational
it's
going
to
be
something
that
i
think
everyone
is
looking
for
trump
said
trump
also
claimed
that
toxic
waste
energy
efficient
light
bulbs
make
him
look
orange
one
in
a
series
of
bizarre
claims
about
green
energy
and
climate
conservation
in
remarks
during
the
remarks
his
administration
last
week
lifted
energy
efficiency
regulations
for
several
common
types
of
bulbs
the
bulb
that
we're
being
forced
to
use
number
one
to
me
most
importantly
the
light's
no
good
i
always
look
orange
he
said
to
laughs
from
the
audience
and
so
do
you
the
light
is
the
worst
the
president
briefly
mentioned
baltimore
toward
the
end
of
his
speech
to
republicans
blaming
democrats
for
decay
in
inner
cities
across
the
country
we're
going
to
fight
for
the
future
of
cities
like
baltimore
that
have
been
destroyed
by
decades
of
failed
and
corrupt
rule
trump
said
in
his
concluding
remarks
trump
also
addressed
homelessness
in
inner
cities
saying
that
his
administration
gave
california
notice
earlier
thursday
adding
we're
going
to
have
to
step
in
and
do
something
about
it
these
are
our
great
american
cities
and
they're
an
embarrassment
what
the
democrats
have
let
happen
he
continued
when
asked
what
his
message
is
to
the
people
of
baltimore
trump
said
ahead
of
his
speech
that
he
looked
forward
to
going
to
the
city
but
did
not
address
the
question
further
instead
turning
attention
to
the
republican
party
i
look
forward
to
it
we're
going
to
be
with
republican
congressmen
and
i
think
it's
gonna
be
a
very
successful
evening
we
had
a
tremendous
election
on
tuesday
the
president
said
ahead
of
his
departure
from
the
white
house
thursday
evening
trump's
previous
comments
about
baltimore
being
unlivable
sparked
a
weeks-long
back-and-forth
between
trump
and
cummings
who
oversees
multiple
investigations
of
trump
and
top
administration
officials
as
house
oversight
chairman
trump's
comments
were
swiftly
condemned
by
baltimore
leaders
including
mayor
jack
young
as
well
as
maryland's
republican
governor
larry
hogan
but
trump's
white
house
staff
and
his
campaign
staff
have
all
continued
to
defend
what
the
president
has
said
about
the
city
and
in
late
july
trump
said
he
doesn't
regret
criticizing
politicians
handling
of
the
baltimore
and
denied
assertions
that
his
critiques
were
racist
cummings
told
cnn's
manu
raju
that
he
hopes
trump
enjoys
his
time
in
the
city
i
hope
he
has
a
pleasant
visit
i
hope
he
gets
a
chance
to
see
quite
a
bit
of
baltimore
it's
a
beautiful
city
a
lot
of
hard
working
people
cummings
said
thursday
when
trump
arrived
at
the
retreat
just
outside
of
cummings
district
in
baltimore
he
was
met
by
demonstrators
protesting
his
policies
at
a
park
a
block
away
from
his
speaking
venue
a
group
calling
itself
the
baltimore
welcoming
committee
which
says
its
composed
of
a
coalition
that
includes
democratic
socialists
of
america
and
immigrants
rights
groups
among
others
is
scheduled
to
assemble
in
the
park
in
the
late
afternoon
and
stay
through
trump's
arrival
at
the
dinner
the
coalition
is
also
scheduled
to
stage
different
events
countering
the
retreat
through
sunday
when
the
retreat
ends
it's
common
for
the
president
to
give
remarks
at
their
party's
annual
congressional
retreat
and
last
year
trump
and
vice
president
mike
pence
both
spoke
at
the
gop
gathering
in
west
virginia
the
theme
of
trump's
remarks
this
year
are
unclear
but
last
year
trump
focused
on
telling
members
of
his
party
that
they'd
either
have
to
compromise
or
win
more
seats
in
in
order
to
reach
a
deal
on
immigration
one
topic
that
will
surely
be
broached
during
the
retreat
is
how
house
republicans
will
recapture
a
majority
since
republicans
lost
the
house
in
a
growing
number
of
house
democrats
have
called
for
a
presidential
impeachment
inquiry
and
trump
and
his
administration
have
been
ensnared
in
more
than
a
dozen
investigations
led
by
house
democrats
just
days
before
trump's
rodent
tweet
cummings
panel
approved
subpoenas
for
work-related
texts
and
emails
on
white
house
officials
personal
devices
putting
trump
son-in-law
jared
kushner
and
daughter
ivanka
trump
in
the
committee's
sights
trump
has
told
people
he
believes
his
children
who
are
also
government
employees
are
being
unfairly
targeted
after
the
tweets
criticizing
the
state
of
baltimore
trump
called
for
cummings
to
use
the
resources
of
the
house
oversight
committee
to
investigate
baltimore's
corruption
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
have
been
given
to
baltimore
it's
been
misspent
it's
been
missing
it's
been
stolen
with
a
lot
of
corrupt
government
and
as
you
know
cummings
has
been
in
charge
trump
said
in
late
july
now
i
will
say
this
i
think
that
representative
cummings
should
take
his
oversight
committee
and
start
doing
oversight
on
baltimore
this
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
developments
thursday
