griffin's
death
is
the
first
american
to

killed
since
president
donald
trump
said
he
canceled
secret
talks
with
the
taliban
that
were
to
be
held
at
camp
david
after
the
taliban
took
credit
for
an
attack
in
kabul
afghanistan
that
killed
a
dozen
people
including
an
american
soldier
trump
claimed
that
before
traveling
to
the
us
the
taliban
admitted
to
the
attack
in
order
to
build
false
leverage
in
negotiations
i
immediately
canceled
the
meeting
and
called
off
peace
negotiations
the
president
added
at
the
time
trump
said
as
recently
as
late
last
month
that
he
is
planning
to
withdraw
thousands
of
us
forces
from
afghanistan
but
will
keep
troops
in
the
country
at
least
for
the
time
being
it's
not
clear
if
his
announcement
regarding
the
canceled
camp
david
meeting
will
impact
that
plan
the
us
currently
has
about
service
members
in
afghanistan
alongside
nato
troops
helping
to
train
and
advise
afghan
troops
and
conducting
counterterrorism
operations
trump
says
he
canceled
secret
camp
david
meeting
with
taliban
leaders
the
afghan
government
has
blamed
the
taliban
for
the
canceled
peace
talks
saying
the
group's
obstinacy
to
increase
violence
against
afghans
is
the
main
obstacle
to
peace
negotiations
we
have
consistently
stressed
that
genuine
peace
is
possible
when
the
taliban
stop
the
killing
of
afghans
embrace
an
inclusive
ceasefire
and
enter
into
direct
negotiations
with
the
afghan
government
the
government
said
in
a
statement
responding
on
to
trump's
decision
to
cancel
the
peace
talks
the
taliban
said
the
move
would
not
harm
anyone
else
but
the
americans
themselves
and
will
show
the
us
anti-peace
stance
in
a
more
clear
way
however
the
taliban
left
the
door
open
to
future
talks
saying
by
continuing
the
dialogue
the
islamic
emirate
has
proved
to
the
world
that
others
have
imposed
war
on
us
and
if
the
path
of
dialogue
is
open
we
are
committed
to
it
