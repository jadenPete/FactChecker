cnn
sen
rand
paul
and
rep
liz
cheney
are
engaged
in
a
tense
war
of
words
over
the
us
presence
in
afghanistan
with
paul
a
kentucky
republican
accusing
cheney
of
wanting
to
engage
in
endless
wars
and
the
wyoming
republican
calling
paul
a
big
loser
for
his
failed
presidential
campaign
on
wednesday
paul
tweeted
a
news
article
about
cheney's
criticism
of
president
donald
trump's
opposition
to
the
war
in
afghanistan
questioning
why
some
neo-conservatives
continue
to
advocate
for
endless
wars
he
added
that
we
should
focus
on
america
first
not
afghanistan
in
response
the
wyoming
republican
said
in
a
tweet
that
she
stand
s
with
trump
and
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
will
never
surrender
to
terrorists
unlike
randpaul
who
seems
to
have
forgotten
that
today
is
a
day
later
the
two
were
still
going
head-to-head
with
paul
casting
cheney
and
her
father
former
vice
president
dick
cheney
as
never
trumpers
during
an
interview
with
cnn's
brianna
keilar
on
cnn
right
now
paul
said
the
two
hate
president
trump's
foreign
policy
and
they
want
to
stay
in
afghanistan
forever
and
cited
the
former
vice
president's
tense
conversation
about
trump's
foreign
policy
with
vice
president
mike
pence
earlier
this
year
the
spat
between
the
two
prominent
republican
lawmakers
comes
as
washington
continues
to
reel
over
the
sudden
ousting
of
john
bolton
trump's
third
national
security
adviser
who
often
clashed
with
the
president
over
foreign
policy
matters
bolton
who
also
served
under
former
president
george
w.
bush
was
widely
viewed
as
a
hawkish
member
of
trump's
cabinet
and
the
feud
between
the
two
members
of
congress
is
reflective
of
the
contrasting
opinions
on
foreign
policy
within
the
gop
in
his
cnn
interview
paul
claimed
the
two
cheneys
love
bolton
the
two
continued
to
feud
on
twitter
thursday
in
a
series
of
ad-hominem
attacks
after
the
senator
suggested
that
cheney
might
just
be
mad
still
about
when
candidate
trump
shredded
your
dad's
failed
foreign
policy
and
endless
wars
during
a
republican
primary
debate
weird
i
don't
see
you
on
stage
here
randpaul
oh
right
my
bad
you
had
already
lost
cheney
replied
referring
to
paul's
unsuccessful
presidential
bid
three
years
ago
bolton's
departure
comes
as
trump
is
discussing
a
drawdown
of
forces
in
afghanistan
and
he
recently
scrapped
plans
to
host
the
taliban
at
camp
david
for
peace
talks
which
bolton
opposed
a
senior
administration
official
told
cnn
that
trump
had
been
getting
irritated
with
bolton
for
his
statements
on
afghanistan
as
well
as
other
foreign
policy
areas
