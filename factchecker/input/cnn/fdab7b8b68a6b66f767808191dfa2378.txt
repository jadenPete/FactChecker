why
some
democrats
are
holding
out
on
impeachment
house
dems
move
forward
with
impeachment
probe
washington
cnn
with
top
democrats
sending
mixed
signals
on
whether
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
conducting
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
dozens
of
democratic
representatives
are
still
resisting
growing
calls
for
an
impeachment
probe
despite
a
pivotal
vote
for
the
investigation
on
thursday
why
the
electoral
map
offers
an
explanation
a
new
cnn
analysis
shows
that
house
democrats
who
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
represent
districts
with
a
margin
of
victory
twice
as
wide
as
their
democratic
counterparts
who
oppose
an
impeachment
inquiry
in
short
the
less
competitive
the
district
the
more
likely
a
house
democrat
is
to
support
an
impeachment
probe
in
the
house
districts
represented
by
democrats
who
support
launching
an
impeachment
inquiry
hillary
clinton
won
by
an
average
of
percentage
points
but
that
average
margin
of
victory
shrinks
to
just
half
of
that
points
in
the
house
districts
represented
by
democrats
who
do
not
support
launching
an
impeachment
inquiry
further
in
the
trump
districts
represented
by
democratic
house
members
only
two
of
them
chris
pappas
of
new
hampshire
and
lauren
underwood
of
illinois
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
overall
the
data
marks
a
shift
toward
the
mainstream
for
impeachment
proponents
since
last
january
when
a
cnn
analysis
found
clinton's
margin
of
victory
was
a
much
larger
points
in
pro-impeachment
districts
vs
points
in
anti-impeachment
districts
based
on
a
january
vote
on
the
floor
in
fact
a
broad
of
the
democrats
representing
the
most
anti-trump
districts
support
an
impeachment
probe
but
only
of
the
democrats
representing
the
strongest
trump
districts
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
democrat
in
the
most
anti-trump
district
who
still
doesn't
support
an
impeachment
inquiry
speaker
of
the
house
nancy
pelosi
we
have
been
having
an
investigation
in
case
you
missed
it
for
a
very
long
time
pelosi
said
earlier
this
week
i
do
know
that
we've
been
on
the
path
to
investigate
and
that
includes
the
possibility
of
legislation
or
impeachment
the
house
judiciary
committee
approved
a
resolution
on
thursday
to
outline
potential
impeachment
proceedings
against
trump
the
committee's
chairman
democratic
rep
jerry
nadler
of
new
york
says
the
move
will
strengthen
the
committee's
ability
to
conduct
its
investigation
but
democrats
are
divided
on
whether
a
formal
impeachment
inquiry
is
already
underway
nadler
said
on
monday
that
his
panel
is
indeed
performing
an
impeachment
inquiry
though
other
top
democrats
have
framed
it
as
merely
a
continuation
of
ongoing
probes
nadler
appeared
tired
of
the
debate
surrounding
what
to
call
his
investigation
thursday
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
nadler
said
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
impeachment
would
require
a
majority
vote
in
the
house
of
representatives
but
removing
the
president
from
office
would
require
an
unlikely
two-thirds
vote
in
the
republican-led
senate
