cnn
us
defense
officials
were
ordered
to
plan
potential
responses
to
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
in
a
monday
meeting
with
president
donald
trump
but
the
white
house
is
waiting
for
the
kingdom's
rulers
to
decide
on
a
response
before
charting
a
path
forward
administration
officials
and
sources
familiar
their
thinking
tell
cnn
two
us
defense
officials
said
that
the
pentagon
was
instructed
to
plan
at
the
white
house
meeting
but
added
that
no
detailed
choices
were
presented
a
source
familiar
with
white
house
discussions
said
the
administration
feels
time
is
on
its
side
as
it
builds
a
case
against
iran
which
has
denied
responsibility
for
the
attacks
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
is
set
to
travel
to
saudi
arabia
on
tuesday
night
to
consult
with
rulers
there
and
the
source
said
nothing
will
be
done
until
pompeo
has
returned
and
trump's
national
security
team
has
assembled
stupid
moves
no
knee
jerk
reactions
to
this
it's
very
systematic
what
happens
with
patience
is
it
prevents
stupid
moves
said
the
source
the
approach
is
already
coming
under
criticism
sen
lindsey
graham
the
south
carolina
republican
who
has
advocated
a
strike
on
iran
in
response
to
the
saudi
attack
tweeted
tuesday
that
the
measured
response
by
president
realdonaldtrump
regarding
the
shooting
down
of
an
american
drone
was
clearly
seen
by
the
iranian
regime
as
a
sign
of
weakness
trump
hit
back
with
a
tweet
of
his
own
replying
no
lindsey
it
was
a
sign
of
strength
that
some
people
just
don't
understand
administration
officials
have
made
the
calculation
that
with
the
united
nations
general
assembly
taking
place
in
new
york
next
week
us
officials
will
have
the
chance
to
meet
with
world
leaders
and
discuss
next
steps
it's
highly
unlikely
anything
will
be
done
before
then
the
source
familiar
with
white
house
discussions
said
the
attack
claimed
by
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
forced
state-owned
saudi
aramco
to
half
its
production
taking
more
than
of
the
world's
daily
crude
oil
consumption
off
the
global
market
cyber
attacks
and
attacks
on
iranian
oil
refineries
were
evaluated
after
the
downing
of
the
us
drone
in
the
strait
of
hormuz
in
june
but
there
has
not
been
serious
consideration
to
revisit
those
options
the
source
said
trump
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
onus
is
on
saudi
arabia
when
it
comes
to
dictating
the
path
forward
and
he's
made
clear
he
is
in
no
rush
we
have
to
sit
down
with
the
saudis
and
work
something
out
he
told
reporters
yesterday
that
was
an
attack
on
saudi
arabia
and
that
wasn't
an
attack
on
us
congress
weighs
response
to
attacks
on
saudi
oil
facilities
we
have
a
lot
of
options
but
i'm
not
looking
at
options
right
now
trump
said
we
want
to
find
definitively
who
did
this
we're
dealing
with
saudi
arabia
we'll
see
what
happens
defense
officials
also
said
that
us
central
command
has
made
no
additional
requests
for
forces
in
the
region
in
the
wake
of
the
attack
and
that
the
posture
of
us
troops
in
the
region
has
not
been
adjusted
but
vice
president
mike
pence
made
it
clear
tuesday
that
military
action
is
one
option
in
the
wake
of
this
weekend's
unprovoked
attack
on
several
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
i
promise
you
we're
ready
as
the
president
said
we
don't
want
war
with
anybody
but
the
united
states
is
prepared
we're
locked
and
loaded
pence
said
as
he
described
the
us
military
as
the
best
equipped
best
trained
and
most
technologically
advanced
fighting
force
in
the
world
during
a
speech
at
the
heritage
foundation
pence
said
the
us
intelligence
community
is
working
to
review
the
evidence
of
the
attack
and
announced
that
pompeo
would
travel
to
saudi
arabia
later
in
the
day
to
consult
with
the
kingdom's
rulers
i
prefer
not
meeting
him
pence
spoke
as
trump
en
route
to
california
walked
back
earlier
comments
indicating
his
willingness
to
meet
with
iranian
officials
telling
reporters
that
he's
no
longer
interested
in
seeing
president
hassan
rouhani
on
the
margins
of
the
un
general
assembly
i
never
rule
anything
out
but
i
prefer
not
meeting
him
trump
said
iran's
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
also
speaking
tuesday
ruled
out
the
possibility
saying
that
there
will
be
no
negotiation
with
the
united
states
at
any
level
the
iranian
supreme
leader
left
only
a
tiny
window
for
future
multilateral
talks
if
the
us
repudiated
repented
and
returned
to
the
nuclear
treaty
that
they
violated
otherwise
the
iranian
government
will
not
meet
with
any
of
the
american
officials

in

accused

of

officials
of
being
in

if
they

yemen's
houthis
wouldn't
strike
back
at
saudi

to
the

deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
told
reporters
tuesday
that
the
administration
can't
say
definitively
that
iran
was
behind
an
attack
on
an
oil
facility
on
saudi
arabia
and
is
still
in
the
process
of
making
the
case
to
the
american
people
a
defense
official
has
told
cnn
that
the
us
has
imagery
that
suggests
the
attack
originated
from
inside
iran
including
evidence
of
weapons
being
readied
for
launch
inside
the
country
cnn
has
not
been
shown
the
imagery
as
saudi
arabia
recovers
in
the
aftermath
a
us
defense
official
tells
cnn
that
the
us
has
a
team
of
forensic
experts
on
the
ground
to
help
analyze
the
site
of
the
attack
and
unexploded
missiles
that
did
not
hit
their
intended
targets
another
us
official
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
latest
information
said
saudi
arabia
has
recovered
fully
intact
circuit
boards
from
one
of
the
weapons
used
in
the
attack
and
that
both
drones
and
cruise
missiles
were
used
cnn
has
not
seen
evidence
to
back
those
claims
the
official
added
that
the
saudis
and
the
us
expect
to
be
able
to
trace
the
point
of
origin
of
the
circuit
board
to
iran
pointing
out
that
the
routes
the
missiles
or
drones
took
avoided
areas
where
us
and
saudi
radar
systems
are
strongest
and
that
the
attack
was
sophisticated
they
have
the
capacity
a
senior
administration
official
said
that
houthis
don't
have
the
capability
to
reach
yemen
the
houthis
have
never
employed
this
type
of
uav
neither
the
uav
nor
the
cruise
missiles
employed
in
the
attack
can
reach
the
facilities
from
yemen
it's
not
possible
the
united
nations
says
otherwise
un
officials
issued
a
january
report
that
said
houthi
drone
capabilities
seem
to
have
become
significantly
more
sophisticated
last
year
capable
of
traveling
distances
that
put
saudi
arabian
targets
well
within
range
and
of
inflicting
far
greater
harm
than
their
previous
drones
which
could
travel
a
maximum
kilometers
the
most
distinctive
feature
of
the
uav-x
is
its
significantly
increased
endurance
and
range
the
report
said
of
the
new
drone
model
adding
that
it
may
have
a
maximum
range
of
between
km
and
km
depending
on
wind
conditions
it
would
give
credence
to
the
claims
by
the
houthis
that
they
have
the
capability
to
hit
targets
such
as
riyadh
abu
dhabi
and
dubai
