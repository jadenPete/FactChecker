white
house
surrenders
on
ukraine
foreign
aid
clapper
says
blocking
aid
to
ukraine
is
a
gift
to
russia
cnn
trump
administration
officials
lifted
a
hold
on
million
in
military
assistance
to
ukraine
on
wednesday
multiple
sources
told
cnn
ending
weeks
of
uncertainty
about
the
future
of
the
aid
the
move
came
as
lawmakers
prepared
to
vote
on
a
measure
that
could
have
forced
the
administration
to
release
the
funds
which
the
white
house
effectively
froze
when
officials
initiated
a
review
of
ukrainian
defense
aid
late
last
month
their
decision
to
pause
the
money
sparked
bipartisan
concern
about
the
potential
consequences
for
ukraine
as
well
as
the
potential
benefits
for
russia
the
assistance
included
sniper
rifles
rocket-propelled
grenade
launchers
counter-artillery
radars
night
vision
and
military
medical
treatment
all
of
which
ukrainians
could
use
to
counter
pro-russian
separatists
but
under
pressure
from
lawmakers
the
white
house
quietly
allowed
the
funding
to
move
forward
this
week
in
what
is
just
the
latest
surrender
from
the
trump
administration
when
it
comes
to
foreign
aid
officials
also
abandoned
an
effort
in
august
to
cut
billion
in
aid
across
the
board
amid
a
bipartisan
backlash
military
aid
to
ukraine
is
protected
in
a
draft
stopgap
spending
bill
as
well
as
funding
for
other
areas
of
foreign
aid
an
administration
official
said
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
had
advocated
internally
for
allowing
the
funds
to
move
forward
but
the
office
of
management
and
budget
pursued
the
initial
hold
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
discussions
trump
had
tapped
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
and
then-national
security
adviser
john
bolton
to
oversee
the
review
a
senior
administration
official
told
cnn
however
although
the
pentagon
recommended
to
the
white
house
in
late
august
that
the
funding
move
ahead
the
hold
remained
in
place
for
several
weeks
bolton
had
been
traveling
to
meet
with
ukrainian
officials
in
kiev
at
the
outset
of
the
suspension
and
sources
told
cnn
the
review
would
not
be
concluded
until
he
returned
white
house
officials
lifted
their
hold
just
two
days
after
bolton's
ouster
from
the
administration
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
was
one
top
voice
in
favor
of
blocking
the
aid
to
ukraine
a
senior
administration
official
confirmed
thursday
that
the
state
department
and
pentagon
would
proceed
with
the
obligation
of
all
military
and
security
assistance
funding
to
ukraine
the
administration
supports
ukraine's
efforts
of
reform
and
self-defense
and
these
funds
will
advance
ukrainian
efforts
toward
those
ends
the
official
said
sen
dick
durbin
of
illinois
had
proposed
an
amendment
that
would
have
withheld
billion
from
next
year's
defense
budget
unless
the
trump
administration
delivered
the
suspended
aid
to
ukraine
several
republican
senators
including
sen
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
and
a
staunch
trump
ally
had
threatened
to
support
the
amendment
graham
credited
durbin's
measure
with
forcing
the
white
house's
hand
so
why
was
it
released
because
of
your
amendment
that's
why
it
was
released
graham
said
during
an
appropriations
hearing
on
thursday
because
i
was
going
to
vote
for
it
so
i
think
they
got
the
message
if
you're
listening
in
the
ukraine
on
c-span
you're
going
to
get
the
money
questions
remain
about
whether
the
pentagon
can
actually
execute
the
million
in
military
assistance
to
ukraine
however
congress
appropriated
that
sum
for
the
fiscal
year
that
ends
on
september
leaving
just
a
few
weeks
for
the
administration
to
deliver
on
millions
of
dollars
in
aid
we
expect
the
majority
of
the
funds
to
be
obligated
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
there
are
measures
that
would
allow
us
to
request
an
extension
from
congress
for
those
funds
that
remain
unobligated
a
us
defense
official
told
cnn
after
the
white
house
hold
on
the
assistance
was
lifted
vice
president
mike
pence
met
with
ukrainian
president
volodymyr
zelensky
in
poland
earlier
this
month
during
the
suspension
of
the
aid
at
the
time
pence
blamed
the
pause
in
assistance
on
trump's
great
concerns
about
issues
of
corruption
i
mean
to
invest
additional
taxpayer
in
ukraine
the
president
wants
to
be
assured
that
those
resources
are
truly
making
their
way
to
the
kind
of
investments
that
will
contribute
to
security
and
stability
in
ukraine
pence
said
critics
had
accused
the
president
of
slow-walking
the
aid
in
order
to
appease
russia
which
annexed
the
ukrainian
territory
of
crimea

story
