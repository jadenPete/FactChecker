harris
said
friday
she
admires
andrew
yang's
expanded
freedom
dividends
proposal
after
appearing
to
chuckle
at
the
suggestion
during
thursday
night's
debate
i
admire
and
frankly
take
joy
in
hearing
people
with
innovative
ideas
and
who
are
questioning

willing
to
challenge

harris
said
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
during
thursday
night's
democratic
debate
harris
appeared
to
chuckle
after
businessman
andrew
yang
announced
that
his
campaign
would
give
a
month
to
deserving
families
harris
defended
her
response
saying
on
friday
that
i
think
he
is
challenging
all
of
us
to
think
about
how
we
can
be
more
innovative
and
i
admire
that
yang's
proposal
which
he
calls
the
freedom
dividends
is
a
model
of
his
universal
basic
income
campaign
platform
yang
is
proposing
to
give
all
americans
and
over
a
month
saying
it
will
help
make
the
economy
more
equitable
and
allow
people
to
decide
how
to
use
the
money
rather
than
the
government
yang
is
currently
making
monthly
freedom
dividends
payments
to
three
families
in
iowa
new
hampshire
and
florida
according
to
his
campaign
under
his
plan
announced
thursday
night
yang
proposed
to
pay
additional
families
with
the
money
coming
from
his
campaign
account
rather
than
his
personal
wealth
campaign
finance
experts
say
it's
unclear
whether
yang
can
make
these
payments
out
of
his
own
campaign
account
as
they
may
run
afoul
of
federal
law
that
bars
converting
campaign
funds
to
personal
use
in
a
statement
yang's
campaign
aides
said
they
had
consulted
with
their
lawyers
who
say
the
freedom
dividends
are
fully
compliant
with
all
fec
regulations
