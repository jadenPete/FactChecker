told

via

the

since
the

is
still
illegal
under

despite
several
states
having
legalized

marijuana
the

greater

and
safety
regarding

a

that
helps

instill
those
qualities

i'm
looking
to
see
whether
we
can
thread
the

may
craft
our
own
bill
or
we
may
work
with
them
to
craft
any
amended
legislation
gardner
said
he
looked
forward
to
working
with
crapo
and
merkley
to
solve
the

clarify
the
challenges
created

our
nation
has
taken
to
cannabis

glad
the
