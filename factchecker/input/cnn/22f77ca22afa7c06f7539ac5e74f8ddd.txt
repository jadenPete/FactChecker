has
further
sanctioned
north
korea
for
its
long-established
efforts
to
hack
financial
institutions
around

saying
the
money
is
used
to
help
fund

north

the

claims
the
group
known
as
the
lazarus
group
and
two
of
its

in

we
will
continue

enforce

sanctions
against
north

and
work
with
the
international
community
to
improve

the
lazarus
group
was
involved
in
the
wannacry
ransomware
attack
in
which
the
us
and
other
allies
said
was
the
work
of
the
north
korean
government
for
years
north
korea's
intelligence
apparatus
has
heavily
targeted
victims
where
they
can
directly
siphon
money
like
the
bank
of
bangladesh
in
the
practice
has
become
extremely
lucrative
earlier
this
year
the
united
nations
said
that
the
country's
habit
of
hacking
bitcoin
exchanges
has
netted
as
much
as
billion
specifically
the
us
said
that
hacking
functions
to
potentially
fund
north
korea's
wmd
and
ballistic
missile
programs
they're
essentially
calling
out
their
criminal
activity
that's
been
going
on
for
four
years
john
hulquist
the
director
intelligence
analysis
for
fireeye
which
tracks
north
korea's
cyber
activity
told
cnn
the
real
question
is
will
the
sanctions
have
any
effect
trump
makes
clear
he's
calling
the
foreign
policy
shots
post
bolton
north
korea's
adoption
of
cybercrime
as
a
major
means
of
funding
the
regime
has
a
cyclical
effect
it
was
likely
adopted
as
a
response
to
international
sanctions
making
it
difficult
to
make
money
but
further
isolates
the
country
on
the
world
stage
which
may
make
it
even
more
dependent
on
hacking
to
stay
financially
float
just
because
it
might
not
stop
the
behavior
doesn't
mean
we
shouldn't
illuminate
it
hulquist
said
it's
still
the
right
thing
to
do
and
maybe
the
smart
thing
to
do
because
it's
on
the
table
now
for
negotiations
he
said
third
summit
possible
the
sanctions
announcement
comes
as
president
donald
trump
continues
to
leave
the
door
open
for
a
possible
third
summit
with
north
korean
dictator
kim
jong
un
trump
hinted
at
high
level
contacts
with
pyongyang
again
this
week
after
firing
his
hawkish
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
the
president
made
it
clear
that
he
believed
bolton's
presence
was
harmful
to
the
diplomatic
process
and
was
at
least
partially
to
blame
for
the
lack
of
progress
in
denuclearization
talks
we
were
set
back
very
badly
when
john
bolton
talked
about
the
libyan
model
and
he
made
a
mistake
and
as
soon
as
he
mentioned
that
the
libyan
model
what
a
disaster
trump
told
reporters
in
the
oval
office
wednesday
the
day
after
bolton's
departure
take
a
look
at
what
happened
with
gadhafi
with
the
libyan
model
and
he's
using
that
to
make
a
deal
with
north
korea
and
i
don't
blame
kim
jong
un
for
anything
he
said
after
that
he
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
john
bolton
and
that's
not
a
question
of
being
not
tough
that's
a
question
of
being
not
smart
to
say
something
like
that
he
added
on
monday
a
top
north
korean
diplomat
working
on
nuclear
negotiations
with
the
united
states
said
pyongyang
would
be
open
to
resuming
talks
with
washington
north
korea
says
it's
willing
to
talk
with
us
and
launches
projectile
the
envoy
choe
son
hui
said
in
a
first-person
statement
published
monday
by
north
korean
state
media
that
north
korea
is
willing
to
sit
with
the
us
side
for
comprehensive
discussions
of
the
issues
we
have
so
far
taken
up
at
the
time
and
place
to
be
agreed
late
in
september
i
believe
that
the
us
side
will
come
out
with
a
proposal
geared
to
the
interests
of
the
dprk
and
the
us
and
based
on
the
calculation
method
acceptable
to
us
choe
said
referring
to
north
korea
by
an
acronym
for
the
country's
formal
name
the
democratic
people's
republic
of
korea
just
hours
later
north
korea
launched
two
unidentified
projectiles
from
south
pyongan
province
toward
the
east
sea
also
known
as
the
sea
of
japan
after
more
than
a
year
of
refraining
from
missile
tests
kim's
regime
has
conducted
launches
since
may
including
the
one
on
tuesday
most
of
those
are
believed
to
be
short-range
missiles
and
experts
say
they
have
shown
impressive
technological
advancements
trump
has
played
down
the
tests
when
speaking
about
north
korea
publicly
at
one
point
he
referred
to
them
as
very
standard
