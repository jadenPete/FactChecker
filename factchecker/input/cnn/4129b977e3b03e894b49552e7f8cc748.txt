will
hold

republicans
in
other
states
cancel
primaries

the
republican
party
is
a
cult
cnn
the
iowa
republican
party
will
hold
caucuses
in
even
as
some
state
republican
parties
are
opting
to
cancel
their
presidential
primary
elections
as
a
show
of
support
for
president
donald
trump
it
was
never
really
a
question
said
party
spokesperson
aaron
britt
who
explained
that
the
iowa
gop
viewed
it
as
a
matter
of
maintaining
its
vaunted
status
as
the
first
battleground
in
the
primary
process
we're
first
in
the
nation
and
that's
a
role
we
take
very
seriously
however
a
handful
of
state
parties
including
south
carolina
arizona
and
nevada
are
planning
to
forgo
their
primaries
or
caucuses
next
year
it
is
not
unprecedented
for
state
republicans
or
democrats
to
decide
not
to
hold
a
presidential
primary
when
an
incumbent
is
running
essentially
uncontested
but
the
move
has
been
met
with
fierce
push
back
from
three
republicans
currently
challenging
president
trump
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
last
week
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
and
former
reps
joe
walsh
of
illinois
and
mark
sanford
of
south
carolina
called
the
moves
to
cancel
primaries
a
disgrace
if
a
party
stands
for
nothing
but
reelection
they
wrote
it
indeed
stands
for
nothing
britt
said
the
iowa
gop
hasn't
come
under
pressure
from
trump
allies
to
cancel
its
caucuses
adding
folks
understand
that
this
would
be
an
opportunity
for
president
trump
to
show
how
strong
he
is
in
this
state
there's
little
question
that
trump
has
a
strong
base
of
institutional
support
among
hawkeye
state
republicans
however
state
party
chairman
jeff
kaufmann
has
been
a
vocal
advocate
for
the
president
speaking
at
a
trump
rally
in
kaufmann
suggested
then-trump
critic
sen
ben
sasse
was
not
welcome
to
campaign
in
iowa
he
crosses
the
missouri
river
and
in
that
sanctimonious
tone
talks
about
what
he
doesn't
like
about
donald
trump
kaufmann
said
at
the
time
you
know
what
sen
sasse
i
really
don't
care
what
you
like
we
love
donald
trump
and
if
you
don't
love
him
i'd
suggest
you
stay
on
your
side
of
the
missouri
river
last
year
kaufmann
clarified
that
republican
challengers
are
welcome
in
iowa
but
if
those
challengers
are
criticizing
republicans
and
the
president
he
added
i'll
push
back
