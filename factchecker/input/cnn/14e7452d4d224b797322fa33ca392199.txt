a
liberal
organization
founded
in
new

endorsed
sen

warren
for
president
on
monday
offering
a
fresh
glimpse
into
an
emerging
primary
season
divide
on
the
progressive
left
warren
won
the
wfp's
support
through
an
online
vote
earning
nearly
support
from
a
combination
of
the
party's
members
supporters
and
national
committee
sen
bernie
sanders
who
was
endorsed
by
the
wfp
ahead
of
the
primary
with
of
the
vote
scored
only
this
time
around
the
nearly
to-
margin
of
defeat
will
sting
sanders
supporters
and
further
embolden
warren
as
she
seeks
to
edge
out
her
colleague
and
ideological
ally
as
the
leading
progressive
primary
choice
and
stake
her
claim
as
the
top
democratic
challenger
to
moderate
former
vice
president
joe
biden
wfp
leadership
sought
to
play
down
the
vote
as
the
sign
of
any
potential
rift
on
the
left
its
national
director
maurice
mitchell
touted
warren's
fierce
populism
in
a
statement
saying
she
strikes
fear
into
the
hearts
of
the
robber
barons
who
rigged
the
system
and
offers
hope
to
millions
of
working
people
who
have
been
shut
out
of
our
democracy
and
economy
but
he
added
that
democrats
were
lucky
to
have
both
warren
who
will
deliver
a
speech
monday
night
in
new
york
city
and
sanders
in
the
race
and
credited
them
for
their
work
to
shift
the
boundaries
of
debate
within
the
democratic
party
senator
warren
and
senator
sanders
have
both
shaped
the
ideological
terrain
on
which
this
campaign
is
being
waged
mitchell
said
they
have
proven
an
effective
team
on
debate
stages
and
in
the
polls
and
we
hope
that
partnership
continues
we're
proud
to
call
both
of
them
allies
in
the
fight
for
a
more
just

the
wfp
which
was
born
and
is
primarily
based
in
new
york
city
has
been
expanding
its
reach
and
influence
since
president
donald
trump's
election
in
last
year
it
endorsed
cynthia
nixon
in
her
progressive
but
ultimately
failed
primary
challenge
to
new
york
gov
andrew
cuomo
a
move
that
alienated
it
from
the
democratic
party
establishment
in
the
state
but
the
party
found
success
down
the
ballot
helping
to
elect
a
slate
of
mostly
young
progressive
state
lawmakers
turning
the
legislature
blue
it
also
worked
closely
with
progressives
in
other
states
most
notably
wisconsin
which
elected
wfp
member
mandela
barnes
to
be
its
lieutenant
governor
the
wfp's
decision
to
jump
into
the
primary
race
now
when
so
many
other
energetic
liberal
groups
and
most
major
unions
have
chosen
to
wait
and
see
how
the
warren-sanders
race-within-a-race
plays
out
sent
sparks
flying
within
the
left's
online
forums
like
mitchell
joe
dinkin
the
wfp
campaigns
director
lauded
both
warren
and
sanders
as
transformative
progressive
leaders
but
said
the
party
wanted
to
get
more
deeply
involved
in
the
primary
we
felt
like
the
wfp
couldn't
sit
on
the
sidelines
dinkin
told
cnn
the
right
wing
the
corporate
forces
in
the
democratic
party
they're
all
getting
organized
so
we
had
to
too
so
we
created
a
process
for
our
party
to
make
a
decision
and
we're
thrilled
to
stand
with
warren
and
work
to
build
her
grassroots
army
the
wfp
endorsement
process
played
over
a
number
of
weeks
as
a
handful
of
candidates
sat
down
for
live-streamed
interviews
in
addition
to
warren
and
sanders
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
and
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
all
actively
sought
their
endorsement
