mitt
romney
says
he
doesn't
plan
to
endorse
anyone
in
cnn
republican
sen
mitt
romney
of
utah
said
thursday
that
he's
planning
to
withhold
his
endorsement
in
the
race
both
in
the
primary
and
in
the
general
election
underscoring
the
uneasy
relationship
between
the
gop's
presidential
nominee
and
the
leader
of
his
party
i'm
not
planning
on
endorsing
in
the
presidential
race
romney
who
has
periodically
sparred
with
trump
told
cnn
in
the
capitol
at
this
stage
i'm
not
planning
on
endorsing
in
the
primary
or
in
the
general
romney's
statement
adds
more
certainty
about
his
plans
in
the
presidential
race
after
previously
signaling
he
was
unlikely
to
endorse
a
candidate
in
the
elections
the
decision
by
a
party's
previous
nominee
to
avoid
backing
a
sitting
president
is
yet
another
norm-breaking
episode
in
trump's
tumultuous
time
atop
the
republican
party
romney
is
a
friend
of
one
of
trump's
primary
challengers
bill
weld
who
served
as
massachusetts
governor
before
romney's
term
in
office
in
an
interview
in
april
romney
called
weld
a
superb
governor
but
declined
to
say
if
he
would
get
behind
the
long-shot
candidate
on
thursday
romney
told
cnn
that
he
has
concerns
with
the
move
by
several
states
to
cancel
their
primary
contests
in
a
bid
to
help
trump
as
he
faces
challenges
from
weld
former
illinois
rep
joe
walsh
and
former
south
carolina
congressman
and
gov
mark
sanford
despite
praise
for
weld
collins
and
romney
won't
say
if
they'll
back
trump
primary
foe
i
would
far
prefer
having
an
open
primary
caucus
convention
process
where
people
can
be
heard
said
romney
who
reiterated
that
he's
not
running
himself
romney
was
an
outspoken
critic
of
trump's
in
the
campaign
but
flirted
with
the
notion
of
becoming
his
secretary
of
state
before
the
president
chose
rex
tillerson
for
the
job
at
the
beginning
of
his
administration
on
the
eve
of
starting
his
job
as
a
freshman
utah
senator
romney
wrote
an
opinion
piece
bashing
trump's
actions
and
questioning
his
character
saying
he
had
not
risen
to
the
mantle
of
the
office
and
after
the
mueller
report
came
out
romney
offered
perhaps
the
toughest
criticism
of
any
republican
lawmaker
saying
he
was
sickened
at
the
extent
and
pervasiveness
of
dishonesty
and
misdirection
by
individuals
in
the
highest
office
of
the
land
including
the
president
yet
romney
only
periodically
spars
with
trump
often
voting
to
back
the
president's
nominees
supporting
his
policies
and
shying
away
from
criticizing
even
some
of
the
more
controversial
trump
tweets
other
trump
critics
have
now
become
allies
of
the
president
after
lashing
trump
repeatedly
in
and
warning
voters
about
the
threat
trump
posed
to
the
country
for
instance
sen
ben
sasse
received
the
president's
endorsement
for
his
senate
reelection
campaign
after
the
nebraska
republican
mostly
avoided
criticizing
the
president
this
year
and
republican
sen
lindsey
graham
of
south
carolina
once
a
fierce
critic
of
trump's
is
now
one
of
his
closest
confidantes
asked
thursday
if
he's
concerned
that
some
state
primaries
are
being
canceled
in
graham
said
it's
been
done
in
the
past
and
that
trump
has
been
a
good
president
so
i'm
all
good
with
that
