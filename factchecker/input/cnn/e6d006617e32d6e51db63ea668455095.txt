cautions
against
potentially
prosecuting
trump
post
presidency
washington
cnn
former
attorney
general
eric
holder
predicted
president
donald
trump
may
be
prosecuted
after
his
presidency
if
he
doesn't
first
face
impeachment
proceedings
while
in
office
but
warned
of
the
possible
risks
to
the
nation
the
obama-era
attorney
general's
comments
come
as
impeachment
advocates
hailed
thursday's
judiciary
committee's
vote
to
formalize
the
rules
of
its
investigation
though
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
avoided
labeling
the
committee's
probe
as
an
impeachment
inquiry

host
david
axelrod
asked
holder
whether
he
thought
trump
is
subject
to
prosecution
upon
leaving
office
holder
replied
well
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
holder
referenced
former
trump
attorney
michael
cohen's
guilty
plea
last
year
to
campaign
finance
violations
tied
to
hush
money
payments
he
made
or
orchestrated
on
behalf
of
trump
we
already
have
an
indictment
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
where
michael
cohen
was
charged
relative
to
the
payoffs
michael
cohen's
already
in
jail
with
regard
to
his
role
there
holder
added
referencing
court
filings
in
the
case
referring
to
trump
as
individual-
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
next
attorney
general
the
next
president
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
determination
he
added
axelrod
also
asked
holder
whether
there
would
be
a
cost
to
prosecuting
trump
post-presidency
in
the
absence
of
impeachment
proceedings
citing
former
president
gerald
ford
opting
to
pardon
his
predecessor
richard
nixon
yes
i
think
there
is
a
potential
cost
to
the
nation
by
putting
on
trial
a
former
president
and
that
ought
to
at
least
be
a
part
of
the
calculus
that
goes
into
the
determination
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
next
attorney
general
holder
said
i
think
we
all
should
understand
what
a
trial
of
a
former
president
would
do
to
the
nation
he
added
acknowledging
that
ford's
decision
may
have
cost
him
the
election
holder
added
but
you
know
i
think
looking
back
i
tend
to
think
that
that
was
probably
the
right
thing
to
do
the
former
attorney
general
also
reiterated
his
support
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
i
think
that
they
should
proceed
with
an
impeachment
inquiry
an
impeachment
investigation
he
added
that
doesn't
necessarily
commit
you
to
actually
impeaching
the
president
