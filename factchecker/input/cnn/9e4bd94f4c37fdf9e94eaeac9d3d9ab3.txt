trump's
warning
to
iran
raises
fears
of
war
and
confusion
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump's
amped
up
rhetoric
that
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
sparked
new
fears
of
war
with
iran
but
also
confusion
about
his
true
intentions
following
an
attack
on
a
saudi
oil
field
that
rocked
global
oil
markets
the
trump
administration
upgraded
the
incident
into
a
global
crisis
with
its
swift
move
to
directly
blame
iran
for
the
coordinated
drone
strike
the
strike
was
claimed
by
houthi
rebels
that
tehran
supports
in
yemen
the
president's
comments
sparked
immediate
uncertainty
over
whether
he
was
being
serious
or
whether
this
tension-raising
tweet
was
like
a
similar
warning
once
aimed
at
north
korea
a
risky
negotiating
tactic
it
is
unclear
whether
his
locked
and
loaded
phraseology
threatens
military
force
against
iran
its
proxies
in
iraq
or
yemen
or
some
kind
of
us
response
that
stops
short
of
retaliatory
attacks
in
fresh
sign
of
the
administration's
incoherent
messaging
on
a
war-or-peace
issue
vice
president
mike
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
appeared
to
try
to
draw
the
us
back
from
the
brink
on
monday
morning
trump
us
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
of
attack
on
saudi
oil
field
i
think
that
locked
and
loaded
is
a
broad
term
and
talks
about
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
he
told
reporters
but
trump's
aggressive
response
already
has
raised
the
possibility
that
the
us
could
become
embroiled
in
a
military
confrontation
between
two
bitter
regional
rivals
that
could
quickly
spin
out
of
control
the
latest
developments
also
underscore
that
even
without
recently
departed
iran
hawk
john
bolton
in
the
white
house
the
path
of
us
iran
policy
perpetually
courts
the
risk
of
a
dangerous
escalation
they
also
highlight
the
head-spinning
nature
of
trump's
foreign
policy
the
president
had
recently
seemed
to
be
trying
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
as
he
goes
in
pursuit
of
big
wins
abroad
to
boost
his
reelection
bid
now
he's
apparently
threatening
war
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
trump
tweeted
on
sunday
confusion
about
trump's
intentions
at
a
time
of
flaring
tensions
with
iran
was
compounded
by
another
of
his
tweets
on
monday
morning
that
appeared
to
downplay
the
effect
of
the
oil
refinery
attack
on
us
interests
we
are
a
net
energy
exporter
now
the
number
one
energy
producer
in
the
world
we
don't
need
middle
eastern
oil
gas
in
fact
have
very
few
tankers
there
but
will
help
our
allies
that
tweet
bolstered
a
growing
impression
that
us
foreign
policy
at
any
moment
depends
on
trump's
whiplash
mood
reflected
by
his
often
contradictory
tweets
a
culture
of
inconsistency
that
us
adversaries
may
now
be
exploiting
on
sunday
for
instance
trump
claimed
reports
that
he
had
agreed
to
meet
rouhani
with
no
conditions
was
incorrect
but
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
thursday
the
president
has
said
he
would
sit
down
with
rouhani
with
no
conditions
risks
of
war
attacks
have
disrupted
of
the
world's
oil
production
if
he
was
intending
to
rattle
iran
but
not
signal
military
action
trump's
brinkmanship
will
spark
fresh
fears
that
his
hyper
personal
approach
could
inadvertently
drag
the
us
into
a
conflict
that
could
quickly
escalate
with
unpredictable
damaging
consequences
in
the
middle
east
and
beyond
us
officials
sunday
pointed
to
satellite
imagery
provided
to
cnn
showing
the
oil
facilities
were
struck
from
the
northwest
suggesting
an
attack
from
iraq
where
tehran
has
proxies
or
iran
among
other
information
tehran
has
denied
any
involvement
but
if
the
attack
was
the
work
of
iran
there
will
be
speculation
that
tehran
has
concluded
that
the
president's
previous
unwillingness
to
back
up
his
rhetoric
with
military
force
during
a
previous
confrontation
in
july
and
the
departure
of
bolton
means
washington
is
unlikely
to
respond
to
any
provocation
that
would
set
up
a
classic
scenario
whereby
misunderstood
signals
and
careless
escalations
can
drag
two
adversaries
into
a
conflict
neither
really
wants
the
implication
meanwhile
that
the
president
was
awaiting
a
go
ahead
from
saudi
arabia
also
opened
him
up
to
accusations
he
was
outsourcing
us
military
action
to
a
foreign
power
it
also
highlighted
how
his
hardline
anti-iran
policy
has
put
all
us
chips
on
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
is
seen
by
many
washington
foreign
policy
experts
as
aggressive
and
unpredictable
and
presiding
over
an
ill-advised
war
in
yemen
that
has
ignited
a
devastating
humanitarian
crisis
so
far
the
united
states
for
all
its
tough
talk
has
not
provided
any
proof
that
iran
was
directly
behind
an
attack
whose
sophistication
raised
suspicions
it
was
beyond
the
houthis
given
the
president's
propensity
to
peddle
untruths
the
burden
of
truth
for
any
military
strike
would
be
high
even
higher
than
it
would
have
been
given
that
inaccurate
intelligence
led
the
us
into
its
last
major
war
in
the
middle
east
in
iraq
questions
about
iran's
calculations
what
the
attacks
on
saudi
aramco
mean
for
oil
prices
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
first
raised
the
stakes
over
the
strike
at
the
saudi
oil
facility
on
saturday
tehran
is
behind
nearly
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
while
rouhani
and
zarif
pretend
to
engage
in
diplomacy
amid
all
the
calls
for
de-escalation
iran
has
now
launched
an
unprecedented
attack
on
the
world's
energy
supply
there
is
no
evidence
the
attacks
came
from
yemen
pompeo
wrote
his
unequivocal
declaration
all
but
boxed
the
united
states
into
a
strong
response
to
the
attack
possibly
involving
some
kind
of
military
action
yet
it
also
begs
the
question
whether
the
president
is
fully
on
board
with
his
own
secretary
of
state
who
is
now
wielding
even
more
power
over
us
foreign
policy
with
bolton
gone
trump
said
he
decided
in
june
to
pull
back
a
military
strike
against
iran
at
the
last
moment
because
it
would
have
killed
many
civilians
and
was
not
proportionate
to
avenge
the
downing
of
a
us
drone
over
the
gulf
of
oman
by
the
islamic
republic
there
were
subsequent
reports
that
he
complained
that
his
aides
were
trying
to
goad
him
into
a
war
with
iran
that
could
contradict
his
campaign
vow
to
avoid
new
middle
east
entanglement
if
iran
or
an
iranian
proxy
does
turn
out
to
be
behind
an
attack
that
sent
global
oil
prices
soaring
there
will
be
questions
about
the
islamic
republic's
motivation
and
how
it
is
calculating
its
response
to
trump's
policies
the
developments
could
suggest
iran
has
no
intention
of
responding
to
any
us
overtures
following
trump's
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
forged
by
his
predecessor
barack
obama
and
the
adoption
of
a
maximum
pressure
sanctions
campaign
iranian
politics
are
notoriously
difficult
to
judge
from
the
outside
but
the
crisis
could
also
indicate
that
factions
in
the
islamic
republic
are
seeking
to
squelch
any
political
maneuvering
room
for
any
leaders
who
are
open
to
talking
to
the
us
rouhani
did
not
specifically
reference
the
attack
on
the
saudi
facility
in
an
address
on
iran's
press
tv
sunday
but
did
accuse
americans
of
running
a
war
operation
by
supporting
the
uae
and
saudi
arabia
on
monday
an
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
said
that
a
meeting
between
trump
and
rouhani
at
the
un
general
assembly
in
new
york
next
week
was
not
on
the
agenda
but
didn't
directly
rule
it
out
recent
developments
would
seem
to
close
trump's
latitude
for
a
meeting
but
the
president
cares
little
for
convention
and
would
love
to
spring
a
surprise
