military

after

field

claim
drone
attacks
on

oil
facilities
cnn
white
house
senior
counselor
kellyanne
conway
said
sunday
that
president
donald
trump
has
many
options
on
the
table
when
it
comes
to
responding
to
what
his
administration
has
described
as
iran's
role
in
a
crippling
strike
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
production
this
weekend
conway
in
keeping
with
the
trump
administration's
policy
of
declining
to
outline
possible
military
responses
to
provocations
declined
to
say
whether
a
retaliatory
strike
on
iranian
oil
is
under
consideration
but
she
did
leave
open
the
door
to
a
potential
meeting
between
trump
and
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
next
week
in
new
york
something
that
was
a
possibility
before
the
attack
in
saudi
arabia
attack
on
saudi
oil
field
a
game-changer
in
gulf
confrontation
the
president
will
always
consider
his
options
conway
said
on
fox
news
sunday
when
asked
if
trump
would
still
sit
down
with
rouhani
under
current
circumstances
we've
never
committed
to
that
meeting
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
the
president's
just
said
he's
looking
at
it
when
you
attack
saudi
arabia
you're
not
helping
your
case
much
she
added
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
pinned
the
blame
on
iran
for
an
attack
at
a
saudi
oil
field
in
a
pair
of
tweets
saturday
but
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
seyyed
abbas
mousavi
rejected
that
accusation
such
blind
accusations
and
inappropriate
comments
in
a
diplomatic
context
are
incomprehensible
and
meaningless
he
said
adding
even
hostility
needs
a
certain
degree
of
credibility
and
reasonable
frameworks
us
officials
have
also
violated
these
basic
principles
yemen's
houthi
rebels
took
responsibility
for
the
attacks
but
they
are
often
backed
by
iran
saudi
arabia
has
been
leading
a
military
campaign
to
quash
the
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
since
march
the
conflict
is
widely
seen
as
a
proxy
war
between
the
saudis
and
iran
which
has
been
backing
the
houthis
but
preliminary
indications
suggest
the
attack
on
the
world's
largest
oil
processing
plant
did
not
originate
from
yemen
and
likely
originated
from
iraq
according
to
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
incident
the
same
official
said
the
damage
was
caused
by
an
armed
drone
attack
in
an
address
on
iran's
press
tv
on
sunday
rouhani
did
not
specifically
reference
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
but
did
accuse
americans
of
running
a
war
operation
by
supporting
the
uae
and
saudi
arabia
transferring
weapons
and
providing
intelligence
what
is
happening
in
this
region
today
has
created
concern
among
majority
of
world
countries
he
said
cnn
has
independently
reached
out
to
the
state
department
for
further
information
regarding
the
attack
and
who
was
involved
global
oil
disruption
cnn
national
security
analyst
peter
bergen
said
there
have
been
more
than
drone
and
missile
attacks
launched
by
houthi
rebels
from
yemen
into
saudi
arabia
and
none
have
been
as
effective
as
saturday's
attack
lending
credence
to
the
belief
that
the
attack
did
not
originate
from
yemen
pompeo
blames
iran
for
drone
attacks
on
saudi
oil
field
drone
strikes
on
crucial
saudi
arabian
oil
facilities
have
disrupted
about
half
of
the
kingdom's
oil
capacity
or
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
cnn
business
reported
earlier
saturday
it's
unclear
when
the
abiqaiq
plant
which
is
operated
by
saudi
giant
aramco
will
be
fully
operational
again
trump
called
saudi
crown
prince
mohammad
bin
salman
on
saturday
to
offer
his
support
for
the
country's
self-defense
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
judd
deere
said
in
a
statement
the
united
states
strongly
condemns
today's
attack
on
critical
energy
infrastructure
deere
said
violent
actions
against
civilian
areas
and
infrastructure
vital
to
the
global
economy
only
deepen
conflict
and
mistrust
the
us
government
remains
committed
to
ensuring
global
oil
markets
are
stable
and
well
supplied
the
spokesman
said
conway
downplayed
the
impact
of
likely
disruptions
to
the
global
oil
market
sunday
by
pointing
to
trump's
efforts
to
develop
domestic
energy
this
president
also
through
his
energy
policy
bill
has
made
us
less
dependent
on
these
foreign
leaders
and
bad
regimes
for
our
energy
supply
she
told
fox's
bill
hemmer
we
have
energy
under
our
feet
and
off
our
shore
and
this
president
is
leading
the
way
to
responsibly
develop
it
bolton's
exit
conway
on
sunday
dismissed
a
question
about
whether
trump
has
a
sufficiently
robust
national
security
team
in
place
in
the
wake
of
the
departure
of
his
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
this
week
she
spoke
broadly
about
the
president
welcoming
dissent
on
his
team
but
then
said
she
was
not
speaking
specifically
about
disagreements
between
the
president
and
bolton
the
washington
post
citing
a
person
close
to
bolton
reported
saturday
that
his
departure
from
trump's
team
stemmed
from
a
disagreement
monday
over
a
suggestion
from
trump
that
the
us
might
lift
some
sanctions
on
iran
as
a
negotiation
tool
conway
said
sunday
that
john
bolton
and
donald
trump
were
aligned
on
many
different
issues
before
the
president
makes
a
decision
he
invites
dissenting
opinions
he
not
just
expects
he
accepts
disagreement
she
said
and
then
he
weighs
the
consequences
hears
everybody
out
reads
the
briefing
papers
and
then
he
makes
the
decisions
conway
said
trump
is
in
the
process
of
interviewing
candidates
and
that
a
decision
could
come
this
week
or
next
it
is
the
president's
agenda
his
national
security
foreign
policy
beliefs
that
will
go
forward
she
said
lawmakers
split
on
military
action
republican
sen
lindsey
graham
on
saturday
called
the
attack
yet
another
example
of
how
iran
is
wreaking
havoc
in
the
middle
east
arguing
in
a
string
of
tweets
the
iranian
regime
is
not
interested
in
peace
they're
pursuing
nuclear
weapons
and
regional
dominance
it
is
now
time
for
the
u.s.
to
put
on
the
table
an
attack
on
iranian
oil
refineries
if
they
continue
their
provocations
or
increase
nuclear
enrichment
iran
will
not
stop
their
misbehavior
until
the
consequences
become
more
real
like
attacking
their
refineries
which
will
break
the
regime's
back
he
wrote
in
a
pair
of
tweets
connecticut
democratic
sen
chris
murphy
criticized
pompeo's
characterizations
of
the
attack
in
a
tweet
saturday
saying
this
is
such
irresponsible
simplification
and
it's
how
we
get
into
dumb
wars
of
choice
murphy
then
doubled
down
in
a
series
of
tweets
sunday
saying
the
us
can't
have
it
both
ways
and
trump
pompeo
see
only
iranian
not
saudi
misdeeds
in
yemen
iran
supports
the
houthi
side
america
supports
the
saudi
side
it's
an
ugly
war
but
the
trump
administration
can't
say
iran
is
responsible
for
every
attack
on
the
saudis
and
then
wash
its
hands
of
saudi
attacks
on
houthi
targets
he
wrote
republican
sen
rand
paul
of
kentucky
also
cautioned
against
us
military
action
telling
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
state
of
the
union
sunday
that
an
escalation
of
the
war
would
be
a
big
mistake
this
is
a
regional
conflict
that
there's
no
reason
the
superpower
of
the
united
states
needs
to
be
getting
into
bombing
mainland
iran
