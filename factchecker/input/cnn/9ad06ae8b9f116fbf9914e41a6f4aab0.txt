about
the

murphy
wrote
in

sent
out
shortly
after
p
m
friday
first
i
want
to
repeat
what
under
secretary
for
intelligence
and
analysis
david
glawe
the
secretary
and
many
others
in
the
department
have
said
in
the
past
there
is
no
room
in
the
workplace
for
such
symbols
of
hate
and
there
is
no
room
in
the
workplace
for
those
who
ascribe
to
such
a
thing
i
have
communicated
with
usia
glawe
who
is
currently
in
israel
and
he
is
disgusted
by
what
has
happened
murphy
then
details
a
number
of
steps
he
said
the
department
is
taking
including
removing
the
swastika
asking
staffers
and
cleaning
personnel
if
they
saw
anything
suspicious
notifying
the
department
of
homeland
security's
offices
of
the
inspector
general
and
security
asking
the
dhs
insider
threat
program
to
take
steps
as
appropriate
and
hearing
suggestions
on
steps
we
may
want
to
take
from
the
dhs
office
for
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
murphy
closed
the
email
reiterating
that
dhs
has
no
tolerance
in
our
workplace
for
such
acts
of
hate
and
this
email
is
just
the
next
step
in
our
communication
and
action
plan
as
happens
in
offices
an
employee
commented
on
the
email
but
accidentally
replied
to
all
check
out
the
latest
i
a
intelligence
and
analysis
insanity
as
if
leadership
really
cares
the
employee
wrote
i
guess
i
should
not
be
surprised
murphy
responded
to
that
individual
also
replying
all
i
do
care
murphy
wrote
neither
murphy
nor
the
employee
responded
to
emails
requesting
comment
but
in
a
statement
to
cnn
andrew
meehan
the
acting
assistant
secretary
for
public
affairs
from
dhs
said
the
act
of
drawing
a
swastika
has
no
place
in
the
department
this
display
of
hate
and
cowardice
does
not
represent
the
dedicated
hardworking
men
and
women
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
meehan
said
it
has
no
place
in
an
organization
that
works
tirelessly
to
protect
the
american
people
and
combat
hate
in
all
its
forms
the
situation
was
immediately
referred
to
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
and
is
currently
being
investigating
to
ensure
that
swift
and
corrective
action
is
taken
this
story
has
been
updated
