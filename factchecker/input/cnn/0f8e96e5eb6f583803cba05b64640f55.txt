cnn
andrew
yang
announced
thursday
that
his
presidential
campaign
will
give
people
a
month
for
a
year
in
an
expansion
of
his
signature
universal
basic
income
policy
platform
yang
announced
during
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
on
abc
news
that
he
will
raffle
off
freedom
dividends
that
will
be
financed
by
campaign
donations
from
supporters
yang's
freedom
dividends
are
central
to
his
campaign
platform
and
he's
dipped
into
his
personal
funds
in
the
past
to
road-test
his
idea
providing
the
monthly
payments
to
three
families
in
iowa
new
hampshire
and
florida
according
to
his
campaign
the
businessman
has
argued
that
a
universal
basic
income
for
all
americans
older
than
would
play
a
key
role
in
making
the
modern
economy
more
equitable
in
a
statement
yang's
campaign
aides
said
they
had
consulted
with
their
lawyers
who
say
the
freedom
dividends
are
fully
compliant
with
all
fec
regulations
but
campaign-finance
experts
say
his
unusual
gambit
using
donors
money
for
these
payments
may
run
afoul
of
federal
law
that
bars
converting
campaign
funds
to
personal
use

a
former
federal
election
commission
lawyer
who
now
is
a
top
litigator
with
the
non-profit
campaign
legal
center
said
yang's
campaign
appears
to
take
the
view
that
the
prohibition
on
personal
use
only
applies
to
a
candidate
using
donor
money
to
pay
his
or
her
own
bills
but
noti
says
the
law
bars
personal
use
of
campaign
funds
by
any
person
although
it's
hard
to
say
with
certainty
until
we
know
the
details
of
the
payouts
on
its
face
yang's
proposal
to
use
campaign
money
to
help
pay
the
day-to-day
expenses
of
selected
people
appears
to
violate
the
law
noti
told
cnn
the
fact
that
the
payments
happen
to
be
consistent
with
yang's
campaign
platform
is
irrelevant
he
added
an
anti-tax
candidate
couldn't
use
campaign
money
to
pay
people's
taxes
and
a
pro-income
candidate
can't
use
campaign
money
to
give
people
cash
yang's
aides
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
interview
request
on
thursday
night
either
way
the
federal
election
commission
is
unlikely
to
weigh
in
on
this
question
any
time
soon
the
agency
charged
with
policing
campaign-finance
laws
and
issuing
guidance
to
candidates
on
these
issues
recently
lost
its
power
to
tackle
major
enforcement
questions
because
it
only
has
three
members
the
fec
needs
at
least
four
members
to
take
significant
action
and
in
the
short
term
yang's
move
likely
delivers
useful
information
to
his
campaign
about
potential
supporters
as
they
head
to
his
website
to
sign
up
for
the
giveaway
after
yang
finished
speaking
on
thursday
night
the
camera
cut
to
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
for
his
opening
remarks
it's
original
buttigieg
said
with
a
smirk
i'll
give
you
that
the
campaign
is
excited
to
work
together
with
our
supporters
to
help
create
more
stories
about
what
the
freedom
dividend
means
for
american
families
it
will
enable
and
empower
citizens
to
pay
their
bills
switch
jobs
take
care
of
loved
ones
and
plan
for
the
future
