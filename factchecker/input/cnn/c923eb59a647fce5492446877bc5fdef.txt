cnn
oil
prices
are
spiking
following
the
attacks
this
weekend
that
disrupted
about
half
of
saudi
arabia's
oil
capacity
that
accounts
for
about
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
and
is
the
biggest
oil
disruption
in
history
the
market
reaction
would
likely
have
been
much
greater
were
it
not
for
the
substantial
increase
in
us
crude
production
over
the
past
decade
from
to
us
crude
oil
production
more
than
doubled
from
million
barrels
a
day
to
almost
million
barrels
a
day
according
to
the
energy
information
agency
much
of
that
increase
has
been
the
result
of
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
by
some
estimates
fracked
oil
wells
accounted
for
more
than
half
of
us
oil
production
in
many
democratic
contenders
support
a
ban
on
fracking
recently
two
of
the
top
three
sens
bernie
sanders
and
elizabeth
warren
have
suggested
that
as
president
they
would
work
to
ban
fracking
in
the
us
beyond
the
market
implications
that
such
a
move
would
have
it
raises
obvious
political
and
legal
questions
chief
among
them
does
the
president
actually
have
the
authority
to
ban
fracking
facts
first
without
an
act
of
congress
the
president
could
not
issue
an
outright
ban
on
fracking
across
the
us
there
are
however
a
number
of
regulatory
and
executive
actions
an
administration
could
take
to
prevent
or
shrink
the
use
of
fracking
technology
particularly
on
federal
land
the
problem
is
that
most
fracking
takes
place
on
private
land
and
any
attempts
to
limit
it
would
likely
face
legal
challenges
on
sept
sanders
wrote
that
any
proposal
to
avert
the
climate
crisis
must
include
a
full
fracking
ban
on
public
and
private
lands
two
days
later
warren
struck
a
similar
note
tweeting
sept
that
on
day
one
of
her
presidency
she
would
sign
an
executive
order
that
puts
a
total
moratorium
on
all
new
fossil
fuel
leases
for
drilling
offshore
and
on
public
lands
and
i
will
ban
fracking
everywhere
first
a
few
facts
about
fracking
fracking
is
a
controversial
method
of
drilling
that
involves
shooting
high
pressure
water
sand
and
other
compounds
underground
to
make
small
fractures
in
rock
to
release
oil
and
gas
while
the
practice
has
led
to
a
drilling
boom
in
the
us
it's
not
been
without
controversy
specifically
there
have
been
questions
about
the
effect
it
has
on
drinking
water
and
methane
emissions
and
it's
even
been
tied
to
a
rise
in
earthquakes
the
us
geological
survey
determined
that
a
few
earthquakes
in
oklahoma
have
been
linked
to
fracking-related
practices
specifically
from
the
disposal
of
wastewater
and
the
epa
found
scientific
evidence
that
hydraulic
fracturing
activities
can
impact
drinking
water
resources
under
some
circumstances
that
along
with
rising
public
concern
over
the
climate
crisis
has
made
fracking
a
particular
target
of
environmentalists
and
politicians
but
how
far
could
a
president
go
in
simply
banning
the
practice
according
to
experts
any
efforts
could
present
a
rocky
road
of
legal
challenges
a
president
can't
unilaterally
ban
fracking
on
private
lands
says
christopher
guith
senior
vp
of
the
us
chamber
of
commerce's
global
energy
institute
but
a
motivated
president
could
embark
on
a
regulatory
agenda
that
would
make
fracking
economically
impossible
guith
noted
that
these
tactics
would
face
a
great
deal
of
legal
challenges
from
states
businesses
and
local
governments
that's
essentially
what
happened
under
president
barack
obama
whose
administration
attempted
to
increase
regulations
on
fracking
and
yet
was
largely
thwarted
in
the
courts
in
the
federal
government
issued
a
series
of
fracking
regulations
through
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
were
meant
to
protect
water
resources
and
force
companies
to
disclose
the
chemicals
used
in
fracking
wyoming
and
colorado
filed
petitions
for
judicial
review
on
the
new
rules
and
in
a
federal
district
court
judge
held
that
the
administration's
regulations
were
unlawful
according
to
the
opinion
on
the
case
by
judge
scott
skavdahl
the
court
found
that
the
bureau
of
land
management
lacked
congressional
authority
to
promulgate
the
regulations
this
story
might
repeat
itself
if
an
administration
tried
to
reinterpret
countless
federal
regulations
in
for
instance
the
safe
drinking
water
act
or
the
underground
injection
control
programs
which
regulate
among
other
things
the
disposal
of
wastewater
from
fracking
to
try
and
curb
fracking
on
private
land
so
how
would
these
candidates
look
to
thwart
fracking
warren's
campaign
suggested
she
would
focus
on
getting
a
bill
through
congress
though
that
would
be
difficult
if
the
republicans
maintain
their
majority
in
the
senate
elizabeth
will
fight
for
legislation
to
ban
fracking
nationwide
saloni
sharma
warren's
deputy
national
press
secretary
told
cnn
she'll
build
on
the
obama
administration's
methane
rule
and
use
executive
authorities
to
regulate
contaminants
to
our
air
and
water
as
a
result
of
fracking
and
other
natural
gas
operations
sanders
plan
would
take
similar
actions
using
rules
and
regulations
among
other
tactics
like
the
clean
air
act
and
the
safe
water
act
to
work
toward
eliminating
fracking
his
campaign
says
an
anti-fracking
administration
could
also
try
to
pass
new
regulations
at
the
epa
that
would
make
fracking
less
economically
feasible
like
the
obama
administration
tried
to
do
with
coal
yet
without
the
help
of
congress
that
route
would
likely
run
into
similar
problems
after
a
cap-and-trade
bill
died
in
the
senate
following
passage
in
the
house
in
the
obama
administration
tried
to
limit
greenhouse
gas
emissions
through
the
epa
and
its
clean
power
plan
the
plan
however
was
immediately
met
with
lawsuits
and
never
took
effect
the
epa
received
a
halt
order
from
the
supreme
court
in
until
a
lower
court
had
ruled
on
it
eventually
the
trump
administration
repealed
the
clean
power
plan
while
the
case
was
still
bouncing
around
in
the
courts
in
order
to
prevent
fracking
on
us
private
lands
a
warren
or
sanders
administration
would
likely
have
to
work
through
regulatory
powers
which
would
ultimately
face
a
myriad
of
legal
challenges
or
they
could
try
their
luck
in
working
with
congress
to
pass
new
laws
on
fracking
any
federal
regulations
however
would
likely
be
undone
by
a
future
administration
who
supports
or
is
not
as
hostile
toward
fracking
