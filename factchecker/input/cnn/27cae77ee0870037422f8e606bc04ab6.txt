lamented
the
majority's
decision
to
leap
frog
a
federal
appellate
court
in
issuing
the
after
hours
order
the
court's
action
was
the
latest
spark
in
an
ongoing
debate
in
judicial
circles
on
the
one
hand
there
are
those
who
say
an
aggressive
solicitor
general
is
coming
to
the
supreme
court
with
increasing
frequency
to
ask
for
emergency
relief
on
the
other
hand
is
a
complaint
from
the
highest
levels
of
the
trump
administration
that
such
requests
are
warranted
because
lower
courts
are
engaging
in
a
relatively
new
tactic
issuing
injunctions
blocking
controversial
policies
nationwide
while
the
appeals
process
plays
out
exclusive

citizenship
question
some
say
the
two
phenomenon
aren't
related
because
not
all
emergency
applications
involve
nationwide
injunctions
but
court
watchers
perceive
a
changing
norm
granting
a
stay
pending
appeal
should
be
an
extraordinary
act

in

review
article
he
points
out
that
in
sharp
contrast
the
trump

has
repeatedly
asked
the

to
step
in
in

and
a
half

the

vladeck
writes
vladeck
believes
the
change
could
be
due
to
a
shift
in
the

standard
for
emergency
relief
a
common
reaction
to
this
trend
is
that
the
justices
are
reacting
to
the
uptick
in
nationwide
injunctions
but
the
data
suggest
otherwise
vladeck
said
not
only
are
a
lot
of
these
rulings
coming
in
cases
in
which
no
nationwide
injunction
was
at
issue
but
even
where
the
district
court
has
issued
nationwide
relief
the
supreme
court
is
stepping
in
in
some
cases
after
the
court
of

has
already
narrowed
the
scope
of
the

non-profit

stop

from
going

and
a

enjoined
the

nationwide
a

then
narrowed
that

to
apply

to
california

when
the

district

reinstated

the

wednesday
night
the

the

hundreds

changing

she

in

she
said
the

should
not
have
stepped
in
yet
these
are
cases
in
which
the
courts
should
want
the
fullest
record
the
most
detailed
and
careful
deliberation
before
allowing
these
aggressive
moves
by
the

she
said
earlier
in

attorney

wrote
an
op-ed
for
the

journal
decrying

injunctions
when
the
system
works
as
it
should
it
encourages
what
one
leading
jurist
has
called
percolation
the
salutary
process
by
which
many
lower
federal
courts
offer
competing
and
increasingly
refined
views
on
a
legal

before
higher
courts
definitively
resolve
it
he

short
circuits
this
process
barr
said
others
think
at

some
of
the
supreme

justices
are
itching
to
take
up
the

we
have
this
troubling
rise
of
this

cosmic
injunction

neil
gorsuch
on
the
supreme
court's

turn
near
as
i
can
tell
that's
a
really
new
development
where
a
district
court
asserts
the
right
to
strike
down
a
federal
statute
with
regard
to
anybody
in
the
world
he
said
but
when
asked
about
the
issue
during
a
wide

interview
last
week
gorsuch
declined
to
comment
well
now
you're
getting
at
something
that
i'm
sure
is
going
to
be
before
this
court
gorsuch
said
and
added
and
you

i
can't

that
are

to
come
up
