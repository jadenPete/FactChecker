donald
trump
has
already
told
us
who
his
new
national
security
adviser
will
be
sources
trump
administration
mulling
pompeo
for
nsa
cnn
president
donald
trump
will
reveal
all
of
his
secrets
to
you
if
you
just
pay
attention
take
the
ongoing
search
for
his
next
national
security
adviser
his
th
in
less
than
years
following
the
firing
of
john
bolton
last
week
here's
trump
from
late
last
week
on
the
job
it's
a
great
job
it's
great
because
it's
a
lot
of
fun
to
work
with
donald
trump
and
it's
very
easy
actually
to
work
with
me
you
know
why
it's
easy
because
i
make
all
the
decisions
see
he
says
it
right
there
donald
trump's
next
national
security
adviser
will
be
none
other
than
donald
trump
himself
i
kid
but
not
really
because
what
trump
said
about
the
national
security
adviser
job
echoes
past
statements
he's
made
about
other
key
openings
in
his
administration
back
in
trump
was
asked
by
conservative
talk
show
host
laura
ingraham
if
he
had
enough
state
department
employees
in
place
to
push
through
his
policies
he
responded
this
way
let
me
tell
you
the
one
that
matters
is
me
i'm
the
only
one
that
matters
because
when
it
comes
to
it
that's
what
the
policy
is
going
to
be
you've
seen
that
you've
seen
it
strongly
i
make
all
the
decisions
i'm
the
only
one
that
matters
and
for
good
measure
throw
in
the
famous
infamous
trump
pronouncement
that
i
know
more
about
isis
than
the
generals
do
axios
has
a
helpful
list
of
all
the
things
trump
says
he
knows
more
about
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
there's
a
clear
pattern
here
trump
views
himself
as
the
only
indispensable
member
of
his
administration
the
person
who
makes
all
the
calls
because
he
knows
more
about
any
given
subject
than
the
so-called
experts
and
because
well
he's
the
president
and
they're
not
now
all
presidents
republican
and
democrat
have
a
healthy
ego
and
an
innate
trust
in
their
decision-making
abilities
it's
what
allows
them
to
believe
that
they
are
qualified
to
represent
a
diverse
country
of
more
than
million
people
but
trump
takes
this
idea
to
an
absolute
extreme
he
is
so
focused
on
ensuring
that
the
public
knows
a
he's
in
charge
b
he's
very
smart
and
c
he
has
the
best
judgment
that
he
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
allow
others
to
get
attention
or
credit
this
is
the
donald
trump
show
not
the
national
security
adviser
show
after
all
there
are
obvious
limitations
to
that
me-me-me
approach
to
governance
the
job
of
president
is
so
big
and
carries
with
it
so
many
varied
challenges
that
it
is
literally
impossible
for
all
expertise
and
decision-making
to
lie
in
the
hands
of
one
person
sure
on
the
biggest
issues
military
intervention
and
the
like
the
last
and
decisive
word
comes
from
the
president
but
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
smaller
decisions
that
happen
times
a
day
across
government
that
a
president
should
leave
to
the
true
experts
in
the
field
because
trump
believes
himself
to
be
an
expert
in
every
field
and
because
he
is
deeply
concerned
about
the
image
that
he
is
not
totally
in
charge
he
tries
to
make
all
sorts
of
calls
and
decisions
that
in
past
administrations
were
left
to
cabinet
secretaries
and
senior
staff
what
that
approach
creates
is
a
yo-yoing
effect
as
a
president
who
lacks
expertise
in
say
iran
nuclear
talks
goes
from
insisting
one
week
that
he
would
be
open
to
meeting
with
the
country's
leader
with
no
preconditions
to
tweeting
this
on
sunday
night
the
fake
news
is
saying
that
i
am
willing
to
meet
with
iran
no
conditions
that
is
an
incorrect
statement
as
usual
who
trump
eventually
names
as
his
national
security
adviser
then
is
immaterial
trump
is
the
national
security
adviser
and
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
defense
and
if
the
people
ostensibly
in
those
jobs
don't
like
it
or
try
to
carve
out
their
own
power
center
within
the
organization
they
won't
have
the
job
for
long
because
after
all
he
makes
all
the
decisions
