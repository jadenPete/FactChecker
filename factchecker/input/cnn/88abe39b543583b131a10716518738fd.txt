an
excerpt
of
a
new
book
detailing
sexual
misconduct
allegations
against

that
he
has
previously
denied
the
excerpt
from
the
education
of
brett

kavanaugh
has
repeatedly
denied
the
allegation
the
book
revisits
ramirez's
claim
and
contains
a
former
male
classmate's
new
allegation
which
the
authors
say
was
corroborated
by
two
sources
the
authors
reported
the
former
classmate
came
forward
to
the
fbi
and
senators
concerning
an
incident
he
witnessed
and

declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
say
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
a
person
close
to
kavanaugh
told
cnn
the
accusation
isn't
new
because
according
to
the
book's
authors
it
had
previously
been
reported
to
the
fbi
and
some
on
capitol
hill
this
person
said
citing
the
new
book
that
some
democratic
senators
despite
having
been
told
of
the
allegations
before
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
did
not
act
cnn
is
not
reporting
any
details
related
to
the
allegation
because
cnn
has
not
independently
verified
it
trump
tweeted
sunday
that
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the
president
initially
misspelled
the
word
libel
before
deleting
the
tweet
and
correcting
the
word
in
a
subsequent
tweet
in
nominating
kavanaugh
trump
seized
a
rare
opportunity
to
solidify
a
conservative
majority
for
a
generation
on
the
supreme
court
the
president
and
those
who
worked
to
get
him
on
the
bench
are
now
waiting
to
see
if
their
calculation
was
correct
and
for
a
sense
of
how
far
and
how
fast
the
conservative
majority
will
move
a
supreme
court
spokeswoman
said
kavanuagh
had
no
comment
on
the
new
allegation
against
the
justice
or
the
calls
for
impeachment
the
president's
pick
for
the
supreme
court
faced
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
that
threatened
to
derail
his
confirmation
in
christine
blasey
ford
a
california
professor
and
the
first
accuser
to
come
forward
testified
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
kavanaugh
sexually
assaulted
her
at
a
party
when
they
were
both
teenagers
he
has
also
denied
that
allegation
trump
at
the
time
sought
to
discredit
ford
and
ramirez
and
said
kavanaugh
was
under
assault
he
mocked
and
imitated
ford
at
a
campaign
rally
and
accused
democrats
of
masterminding
a
con
game
against
his
supreme
court
nominee
conservatives
throughout
the
controversy
largely
stood
by
kavanaugh
who
was
confirmed
in
october
to
take
former
justice
anthony
kennedy's
seat
after
the
vicious
approval
battle
and
a
senate
vote
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
tweeted
sunday
he
looks
forward
to
many
years
of
service
to
come
from
justice
kavanaugh
fortunately
a
majority
of
senators
and
the
american
people
rallied
behind
timeless
principles
such
as
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
mcconnell
wrote
democrats

a

tweeted
kavanaugh
should
be
impeached
i
sat
through
those

brett

lied
to
the
u.s.
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
harris
wrote
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the

is
an
insult
to
the

investigate
the
matter
castro
said
in
a
separate

castro
fired
back
at
trump's
sunday
kavanaugh
comments
the
department
of

isn't
your
law
firm
or
brett

even
if

acts
like

also
a
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
told
abc's
this
week
on
sunday
she
strongly
opposed
kavanaugh's
confirmation
and
accused
barr
of
shielding
documents
related
to
the
allegations
against
kavanaugh
i
strongly
opposed
him
based
on
his
views
on
executive
power
which
will
continue
to
haunt
our
country
as
well
as
how
he
behaved
including
the
allegations
that
we
are
hearing
more
about
today
klobuchar
told
abc
klobuchar
said
the
process
was
a
sham
and
added
i
don't
think
that
you
can
look
at
impeachment
hearings
without
getting
the
documents
the
house
would
have
to
get
the
documents
and
the
attorney
general
is
shielding
documents
she
said
all
of
the
relevant
information
needs
to
come
forward
before
considering
an
impeachment
process
against
kavanaugh

the
revelations
today
confirm
what
we
already
knew
during
his
hearing
kavanaugh
faced
credible
accusations
and
likely
lied
to
congress
i
support
any
appropriate
constitutional
mechanism
to
hold
him
accountable
former
texas

tweeted
yesterday
we
learned
of
another
accusation
against
brett
kavanaugh
one
we
didn't
find
out
about
before
he
was
confirmed
because
the

forced
the

to
rush
its
investigation
to
save
his

we
know
he
lied
under
oath
he
should
be
impeached

courageously
did
