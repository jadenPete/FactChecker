say
new
allegation
against

shows
fbi
investigation
was
inadequate
washington
cnn
democratic
sen
chris
coons
said
tuesday
that
the
fbi's
investigation
into
sexual
misconduct
allegations
during
confirmation
hearings
for
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
was
a
sham
during
an
interview
with
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
the
delaware
senator
also
said
he's
interested
in
figuring
out
who
handled
the
probe
and
that
a
new
investigation
should
be
opened
into
the
allegations
by
two
women
who
came
forward
last
year
the
question
that
we
don't
have
answered
alisyn
is
given
that
that
investigation
is
a
sham
at
whose
direction
did
that
happen
the
fbi
doesn't
just
make
these
things
up
they
were
acting
in
response
to
a
client
whether
they
considered
that
white
house
counsel
or
the
senate
judiciary
committee
majority
coons
said
coons
comments
come
in
the
wake
of
new
developments
in
the
kavanaugh
saga
which
began
a
year
ago
after
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
surfaced
against
the
nominee
during
the
confirmation
process
following
an
outcry
from
congressional
democrats
including
coons
who
sits
on
the
senate
judiciary
committee
the
fbi
opened
a
supplemental
background
investigation
into
kavanaugh
which
ultimately
found
none
of
the
allegations
to
be
true
kavanaugh
has
vehemently
denied
all
of
the
allegations
against
him
senator
urged
fbi
to
reach
out
to
kavanaugh
witness
letter
shows
sen
chuck
grassley
who
chaired
the
judiciary
committee
during
kavanaugh's
confirmation
defended
the
committee's
review
of
allegations
against
kavanaugh
calling
it
incredibly
thorough
and
saying
in
the
end
there
was
no
credible
evidence
to
support
any
of
the
allegations
cnn
reported
last
year
that
the
fbi's
supplemental
investigation
was
limited
in
scope
from
the
beginning
last
year
senate
republicans
and
the
white
house
say
they
allowed
the
fbi
to
pursue
leads
within
the
parameters
that
sen
jeff
flake
and
other
undecided
republican
senators
agreed
to
credible
current
allegations
against
kavanaugh
asked
by
camerota
if
he
thinks
kavanaugh
should
be
on
the
supreme
court
coons
replied
look
i
want
this
question
answered
at
whose
direction
was
this
narrowed
why
didn't
a
more
fulsome
investigation
happened
i
think
that
frankly
judge
kavanaugh
and
the
american
people
and
certainly
dr
christine
blasey
ford
and
ms
deborah
ramirez
deserved
the
sort
of
fuller
investigation
that
was
entirely
possible
within
a
week
and
i'm
hoping
that's
what
will
happen
next

for
his
prior
conduct
and
testimony
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
we
must
protect
the
integrity
of
our
justice
system
and
it
is
imperative
that
we
pursue
a
legitimate
search
for
truth
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
people

one
new
allegation
from
a
former
male
classmate
max
stier
who
sources
told
the
authors
has
come
forward
to
the

urged
the
fbi
in
a
letter
to
reach
out
to
a
witness
who
had
key
information
about
alleged
misconduct
by
the
nominee
while
he
was
a
student
at
yale
the
book's
authors
said
stier
relayed
his
recollections
to
senators
during
the
confirmation
process
and
later
made
clear
his
willingness
to
share
them
with
the
fbi
but
he
refused
to
speak
about
them
publicly
stier
declined
to
comment
to
cnn
the
female
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
by
the
book's
authors
and
her
friends
told
the
authors
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
additionally
the
book
reports
that
the
fbi
did
not
investigate
this
incident
the
fbi
declined
to
respond
when
asked
about
the
allegation
cnn
is
not
reporting
any
details
of
the
accusation
and
has
not
independently
corroborated
the
account
in
a
letter
dated
october
coons
sent
a
letter
to
the
fbi
requesting
that
the
agency
talk
to
individuals
that
had
more
information
about
kavanaugh
specifically
coons
suggested
the
fbi
talk
to
stier
it's
unclear
from
the
letter
exactly
what
information
stier
had
but
coons
suggests
the
fbi
talk
to
him
stier's
name
in
the
letter
is
redacted
in
the
version
seen
by
cnn
but
an
aide
for
coons
told
cnn
that
that
the
name
was
stier's
coons
had
copied
grassley
an
iowa
republican
and
the
judiciary
committee's
top
democrat
sen
dianne
feinstein
of
california
an
aide
familiar
with
the
letter
told
cnn
that
the
fbi
acknowledged
receipt
of
coons
letter
at
the
time
but
the
senator
never
heard
more
beyond
that
