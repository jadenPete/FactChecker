so
are
we
getting
a
gun
control
bill
or
trump
says
dummy
beto
is
making
gun
talks
harder
washington
cnn
anyone
who
tells
you
they
know
whether
congress
will
bring
up
much
less
pass
any
new
gun
control
legislation
before
they
leave
washington
for
the
year
is
lying
why
because
only
one
man
matters
in
determining
the
fate
of
any
gun
bill
and
he's
giving
all
sorts
of
mixed
signals
dummy
beto
made
it
much
harder
to
make
a
deal
president
donald
trump
tweeted
wednesday
morning
in
reference
to
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke's
support
for
a
mandatory
buyback
program
on
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
convinced
many
that
dems
just
want
to
take
your
guns
away
will
continue
forward
that
continuing
forward
seemed
to
be
represented
by
attorney
general
william
barr's
presence
on
capitol
hill
and
the
circulation
of
a
draft
proposal
by
white
house
legislative
affairs
director
eric
ueland
and
him
that
would
require
background
checks
on
all
commercially
advertised
gun
sales
the
proposal
would
close
the
so-called
gun
show
loophole
except
that
on
wednesday
white
house
spokesman
hogan
gidley
made
clear
that
what
barr
and
ueland
were
shopping
didn't
have
the
sign-off
of
the
president
not
even
close
gidley
told
the
atlantic's
elaina
plott
all
of
which
leaves
us
well
nowhere
which
is
where
we
have
been
since
the
conversation
about
the
possibility
of
new
gun
control
legislation
began
after
back-to-back
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
in
early
august
you
can
almost
hear
the
weariness
and
wariness
in
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell's
kentucky
voice
when
he
was
asked
about
the
status
of
a
gun
bill
earlier
this
week
by
reporters
i
still
await
guidance
from
the
white
house
as
to
what
trump
thinks
he's
comfortable
signing
said
mcconnell
if
and
when
that
happens
then
we'll
have
a
real
possibility
of
actually
changing
the
law
and
hopefully
making
some
progress
mcconnell
has
been
saying
virtually
that
same
thing
since
the
day
after
the
el
paso
and
dayton
shootings
and
while
it
makes
his
democratic
critics
crazy
it's
really
just
a
frank
assessment
of
the
political
reality
in
washington
on
guns
these
days
if
trump
wants
something
to
pass
and
puts
his
twitter
feed
and
his
cadre
of
supporters
behind
it
it
will
likely
pass
if
he
doesn't
back
it
or
backs
some
legislation
and
then
walks
away
from
it
amid
an
uproar
from
the
national
rifle
association
it
won't
the
point
trump's
is
the
only
voice
that
matters
here
and
he
continues
to
speak
out
of
both
sides
of
his
mouth
