what
trump
reveals
in
saying
hispanic
supporter
looks
more
like
a
wasp
than
i
do
cnn
president
donald
trump
rarely
deviates
from
his
script
in
this
case
his
backhanded
appeals
to
racial
minorities
on
monday
evening
he
commemorated
hispanic
heritage
month
during
a
rally
in
rio
rancho
new
mexico
he
happens
to
be
hispanic
but
i've
never
quite
figured
it
out
because
he
looks
more
like
a
wasp
than
i
do
the
president
said
about
steve
cortes
a
cnn
contributor
and
trump's
brand
of
conservative
trump
continued
nobody
loves
the
hispanics
more
who
do
you
like
more
the
country
or
the
hispanics
he
says
the
country
i
don't
know
i
may
have
to
go
for
the
hispanics
to
be
honest
with
you
we
got
a
lot
of
hispanics
we
love
our
hispanics
get
out
and
vote
what
was
on
display
at
monday's
rally
was
the
same
kind
of
rhetorical
sorcery
the
president
is
known
for
this
time
in
pursuit
of
an
ambitious
bid
to
upset
new
mexico's
decade-plus
streak
as
a
democratic
stronghold
how
trump
speaks
to
black
americans
says
a
lot
about
his
vision
for
this
country
consider
his
patronizing
comments
to
the
audience
wrapped
in
his
queasy
repetition
of
the
word
love
note
too
his
insistence
on
using
the
before
hispanics
he
did
something
similar
last
week
when
delivering
an
address
at
the
national
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
week
conference
the
president's
specific
approach
to
speaking
with
minority
groups
allows
him
to
shower
fustian
praise
without
confronting
his
prominent
history
of
racist
statements
and
behavior
in
addition
there
was
his
instructive
telegraphing
about
identity
specifically
about
what
he
thinks
it
means
to
look
hispanic
or
register
as
a
wasp
it's
almost
certain
that
no
one
would
ever
mistake
trump
for
a
scholar
of
race
and
its
innumerable
complexities
in
american
life
but
it's
still
telling
that
even
as
he
was
addressing
a
crowd
including
many
hispanic
supporters
he
couldn't
piece
together
what
the
diversity
around
him
revealed
about
his
unsophisticated
understanding
of
race
also
the
either-or
dichotomy
of
who
do
you
like
more
the
country
or
the
hispanics
it's
a
line
consistent
with
trump's
much
larger
tendency
to
frame
americanness
for
certain
typically
nonwhite
non-
wasp
groups
as
something
to
be
earned
through
partisan
loyalty
think
of
the
president's
remarks
about
former
san
francisco
ers
quarterback
colin
kaepernick
or
about
the
progressive
congressional
squad
or
about
american
jews
or
his
my
african
american
remark
it
might
be
tempting
to
say
that
trump
is
taking
a
different
political
tack
by
pitching
to
hispanic
voters
in
a
state
he
lost
in
the
presidential
election
but
just
under
the
surface
it's
clear
that
it's
the
same
fantasia
of
barely-there
benevolence
plus
a
change
plus
c'est
la
