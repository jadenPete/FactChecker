conservative
activists
are
calling
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
to
support
funding
to
upgrade
voting
machines
across
the
country
that
critics
argue
are
out
of
date
and
insecure
anti-tax
activist
grover
norquist
and
freedomworks
president
adam
brandon
issued
a
call
wednesday
for
congress
to
allocate
additional
money
for
election
equipment
upgrades
and
to
mandate
that
elections
use
paper
ballots
that
can
be
used
for
an
independent
audit
we
benefit
from
more
secure
elections
we
benefit
from
being
able
to
double-check
norquist
told
cnn
ahead
of
a
news
conference
announcing
his
position
i
expect
to
be
winning
elections
for
the
next
years
and
i
don't
want
the
democrats
to
explain
that
every
single
one
of
those
was
stolen
so
let's
make
it
ironclad
first
on
cnn
colorado
becomes
first
state
to
ban
barcodes
for
counting
votes
over
security
concerns
election
security
advocates
have
long
argued
that
the
issue
shouldn't
be
partisan
but
in
the
wake
of
president
donald
trump's
public
refusals
to
acknowledge
the
us
intelligence
community's
findings
that
russia
interfered
in
the
election
on
his
behalf
it's
largely
been
democrats
who
have
argued
that
voting
machines
need
upgrading
and
need
to
be
audited
on
paper
ballots
and
that
states
need
cybersecurity
staff
on
call
norquist
said
he
supports
a
version
of
the
secure
elections
act
a
bipartisan
bill
introduced
last
year
by
members
of
the
senate
intelligence
committee
though
it's
yet
to
be
reintroduced
this
year
while
generally
considered
less
stringent
than
other
election
security
bills
the
secure
elections
act
would
motivate
states
to
replace
all-digital
voting
machines
by
appropriating
funds
for
replacements
only
if
the
money
would
go
toward
equipment
that
relies
on
paper
ballots
democrats
largely
place
the
blame
on
mcconnell
a
kentucky
republican
who
has
refused
to
pick
up
various
election
security
bills
that
have
passed
the
democrat-led
house
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
a
new
york
democrat
has
said
democrats
will
push
for
an
amendment
to
boost
election
security
funding
at
a
markup
of
several
bills
in
the
appropriations
committee
on
thursday
mcconnell's
office
didn't
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
correction
this
story
has
been
updated
to
correctly
characterize
how
democrats
plan
to
advocate
for
an
amendment
to
increase
election
security
funding
