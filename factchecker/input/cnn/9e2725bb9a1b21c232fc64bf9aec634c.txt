are
part
of
whistleblower
complaint
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump's
communications
with
a
foreign
leader
which
included
a
promise
sparked
the
whistleblower
complaint
that
has
led
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
to
agree
to
testify
amid
a
showdown
with
congress
the
washington
post
reported
wednesday
the
post
reported
that
an
official
in
the
american
intelligence
community
was
so
bothered
by
a
promise
trump
made
to
a
foreign
leader
that
the
official
filed
a
formal
whistleblower
complaint
with
the
inspector
general
of
the
intelligence
community
according
to
two
former
us
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
it's
unknown
which
leader
trump
was
speaking
to
and
it's
the
first
time
his
direct
involvement
in
the
complaint
has
been
reported
according
to
the
post
the
complaint
was
filed
on
august
and
white
house
records
show
trump
had
spoken
to
or
interacted
with
five
foreign
leaders
in
the
previous
five
weeks
the
post
reports
russian
president
vladimir
putin
north
korean
dictator
kim
jong
un
the
prime
minister
of
pakistan
the
prime
minister
of
the
netherlands
and
the
emir
of
qatar
however
it's
not
clear
that
the
communication
that
inspired
the
complaint
was
with
any
of
those
leaders
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
the
post's
requests
for
comment
and
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
and
a
lawyer
representing
the
whistleblower
declined
to
comment
to
the
post
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
also
declined
to
comment
when
reached
by
cnn
on
wednesday
the
complaint
has
led
to
a
standoff
between
congress
and
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
joseph
maguire
who
has
refused
to
turn
over
the
complaint
to
the
house
intelligence
committee
maguire
has
agreed
to
testify
next
week
in
an
open
session
before
the
committee
after
refusing
to
comply
with
tuesday's
deadline
to
hand
over
the
whistleblower
complaint
which
had
been
deemed
by
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
to
be
credible
and
urgent
the
committee's
chairman
rep
adam
schiff
announced
wednesday
that
maguire
will
appear
at
a
m
on
september
the
california
democrat
also
announced
that
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
will
brief
the
house
committee
thursday
behind
closed
doors
about
how
it
handled
the
whistleblower
complaint
in
a
subpoena
issued
last
week
schiff
said
he
would
force
the
acting
intelligence
chief
to
testify
this
thursday
if
he
did
not
comply
with
a
request
to
turn
over
the
complaint
and
all
corresponding
records
on
tuesday
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
sent
letters
to
schiff
and
ranking
republican
rep
devin
nunes
of
california
saying
not
only
that
maguire
was
refusing
to
provide
the
requested
information
as
the
complaint
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
urgent
concern
but
also
that
he
would
not
appear
before
the
committee
as
scheduled
because
he
is
not
available
on
such
short
notice
but
by
wednesday
the
two
sides
appeared
to
have
reached
a
compromise
if
only
on
the
timing
of
the
hearing
setting
the
stage
for
what
could
be
a
contentious
public
hearing
maguire
will
likely
be
grilled
by
lawmakers
concerned
that
the
administration
may
have
violated
whistleblower
protections
and
whether
president
donald
trump
or
top
white
house
officials
were
involved
in
the
case
schiff
said
monday
that
he
does
not
know
the
exact
nature
of
the
complaint
as
he
has
not
yet
received
the
details
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
nor
does
he
know
the
whistleblower's
identity
he
has
argued
that
maguire
has
taken
unprecedented
steps
to
withhold
the
information
from
congress
according
to
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
letter
tuesday
to
schiff
obtained
by
cnn
the
complaint
does
not
involve
anyone
in
the
intelligence
community
but
rather
stakeholders
within
the
executive
branch
as
a
result
its
lawyer
argues
the
complaint
is
not
of
urgent
concern
to
the
office
the
office
wrote
that
it
plans
to
work
with
the
house
intelligence
committee
but
given
that
executive
branch
members
are
involved
there
are
confidential
and
potentially
privileged
matters
that
will
necessarily
require
appropriate
consultations
in
response
schiff
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
the
ic
ig
determined
that
the
complaint
is
both
credible
and
urgent
which
is
why
the
committee
must
move
quickly
the
committee's
position
is
clear
the
acting
dni
can
either
provide
the
complaint
as
required
under
the
law
or
he
will
be
required
to
come
before
the
committee
to
tell
the
public
why
he
is
not
following
the
clear
letter
of
the
law
including
whether
the
white
house
or
the
attorney
general
are
directing
him
to
do
so
he
has
yet
to
provide
the
complaint
in
response
to
the
committee's
subpoena
so
i
expect
him
to
appear
on
thursday
under
subpoena
if
necessary
while
schiff
appeared
willing
to
work
with
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
on
the
date
of
maguire's
hearing
he
maintained
that
the
complaint
should
still
be
given
to
congress
the
ic
ig
determined
that
this
complaint
is
both
credible
and
urgent
and
that
it
should
be
transmitted
to
congress
under
the
clear
letter
of
the
law
the
committee
places
the
highest
importance
on
the
protection
of
whistleblowers
and
their
complaints
to
congress
he
said
wednesday
schiff
is
demanding
that
maguire
turn
over
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general's
determination
and
all
records
pertaining
to
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
odni
involvement
in
this
matter
including
any
and
all
correspondence
with
other
executive
branch
actors
such
as
the
white
house
according
to
last
week's
news
release
from
the
congressman's
office
schiff
also
argued
that
maguire
had
acted
outside
the
authority
of
his
post
by
consulting
with
the
department
of
justice
about
the
complaint
as
he
involved
another
entity
within
the
executive
branch
in
the
handling
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
schiff
declined
to
say
whether
he
has
been
contacted
by
the
whistleblower
or
their
legal
representation
saying
he
wouldn't
want
to
jeopardize
them
a
source
familiar
with
the
case
told
cnn
that
the
intelligence
community
whistleblowers
protection
act
likely
offers
only
one
real
path
forward
circumventing
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
and
giving
the
complaint
directly
to
the
committee
that
route
may
also
be
complicated
the
source
warned
noting
it
could
raise
classification
issues
tied
to
transmitting
the
material
