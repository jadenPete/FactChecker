newman
for
failing

report
after
she
was
fired
phillips
wrote
that
the
reason
that
newman
was
incapable
of
completing
her
financial
disclosure
form
was
because
it
contained
an
incorrect
termination
date
and
there
was
lack
of
access
to
necessary
financial
records
that
the
white
house
held
he
claimed
that
the
multiple
email
requests
to
newman
were
all
sent
to
an
unmonitored
email
address

refers
to
a
phone
call
between
newman
and

passantino
as
proof
that

disclosure
report
according
to
the
motion
which
includes
a
log
of
the
call
newman
had
informed
passantino
about
the
date
error
on
her
form

passantino
said
he
would

passantino
never
reported

provided
the
court
with
a
taped
copy
of
that
phone
call
from
march
between
newman
and
passantino
the
facts
of
this

show
that

newman
has
desired

the
beginning

she
served
as
director
of

for
about
a
year
until

john
kelly
then
in
a
stunning
about-face
for
a
former
top
aide
newman
wrote
a
tell-all
book
that
was
mostly
unverifiable
about
her
west
wing
tenure
featuring
an
unflattering
portrayal
of
trump
as
a
racist
lewd
and
mentally
unhinged
leader
newman
also
released
secret
recordings
she
made
of
kelly
firing
her
in
