why
brett
kavanaugh
isn't
going
anywhere
cnn
the
country
is
abuzz
about
the
prospect
of
impeaching
a
powerful
figure
who
got
his
ultra-influential
job
under
a
cloud
of
controversy
no
not
president
donald
trump
this
time
i'm
talking
about
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
kavanaugh
made
it
to
the
nation's
highest
court
in
october
after
a
nomination
process
that
was
dominated
by
allegations
that
he
had
sexually
assaulted
women
in
both
high
school
and
college
allegations
that
he
denied
the
confirmation
hearings
highlighted
by
the
emotional
testimony
of
christine
blasey
ford
who
said
kavanaugh
had
assaulted
her
at
a
party
in
high
school
became
a
cultural
touchstone
it
sparked
a
broader
conversation
amid
the
me
too
movement
about
whether
allegations
like
these
had
some
sort
of
cultural
statute
of
limitations
about
the
reliability
of
memory
and
of
what
we
owe
accusers
and
the
accused
it
dominated
the
news
for
weeks
it
even
became
the
stuff
of
parody
with
matt
damon
playing
kavanaugh
during
a
particularly
memorable
skit
on
saturday
night
live
but
then
the
story
mostly
went
away
as
kavanaugh
got
confirmed
and
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
of
the
supreme
court
however
a
new
book
by
two
new
york
times
reporters
which
includes
new
allegations
about
kavanaugh's
behavior
in
college
has
re-started
the
debate
of
how
he
got
onto
the
court
in
the
first
place
and
whether
he
should
stay
there
the
new
kavanaugh
book
the
education
of
brett
kavanaugh
revisits
one
of
the
claims
and
contains
a
former
male
classmate's
new
allegation
which
the
authors
say
was
corroborated
by
two
sources
and
reporting
that
suggests
the
fbi
didn't
interview
potential
witnesses
during
its
examination
of
the
allegations
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
kavanaugh
became
a
political
football
again
trump
sent
a
flurry
of
tweets
defending
kavanaugh
including
this
one
brett
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the
lies
being
told
about
him
are
unbelievable
false
accusations
without
recrimination
when
does
it
stop
they
are
trying
to
influence
his
opinions
can't
let
that
happen
sidebar
in
the
original
tweet
trump
spelled
libel
l-i-a-b-l-e
which
is
of
course
liable
totally
fine
very
normal
at
least
five
of
trump's
potential
democratic
rivals
elizabeth
warren
bernie
sanders
kamala
harris
beto
o'rourke
and
pete
buttigieg
quickly
called
for
kavanaugh
to
be
impeached
which
got
me
to
wondering
how
do
you
impeach
a
supreme
court
justice
and
might
it
you
know
actually
happen
the
first
question
is
easier
to
answer
than
the
second
so
let's
tackle
that
one
first
impeaching
a
supreme
court
justice
it
turns
out
is
a
lot
like
impeaching
a
president
so
an
impeachment
effort
would
start
in
the
house
where
a
majority
could
approve
of
articles
of
impeachment
against
kavanaugh
the
charges
would
likely
deal
with
allegations
made
by
some
democrats
that
he
lied
about
his
conduct
in
high
school
and
college
under
oath
during
his
senate
confirmation
hearing
if
the
house
passed
impeachment
a
trial
would
then
be
held
in
the
senate
in
order
to
remove
kavanaugh
two-thirds
of
the
senate
would
have
to
vote
to
convict
him
it's
probably
worth
noting
here
that
a
sitting
supreme
court
justice
has
never
actually
been
removed
from
office
by
congress
samuel
chase
came
close
in
when
he
was
impeached
by
the
house
but
acquitted
by
the
senate
the
charge
against
chase
that
he
was
too
partisan
man
was
the
th
century
quaint
just
because
no
supreme
court
justice
has
ever
been
impeached
and
removed
from
the
bench
doesn't
mean
people
haven't
been
trying
to
do
just
that
for
years
there
have
been
calls
for
impeachment
charges
to
be
brought
against
among
others
justice
clarence
thomas
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts
jr
and
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
as
washington
post
supreme
court
reporter
robert
barnes
notes
there
were
billboards
across
the
south
during
the
s
calling
for
the
impeachment
of
justice
earl
warren
following
several
rulings
on
desegregation
in
short
we've
been
here
before
and
for
all
of
the
sound
and
fury
even
samuel
chase
served
six
more
years
on
the
country's
highest
court
after
being
acquitted
by
the
senate
that
history
plus
our
current
political
reality
make
it
very
very
unlikely
that
kavanaugh
is
going
to
be
kicked
off
the
court
why
even
if
the
democratic-controlled
house
managed
to
impeach
kavanaugh
and
that
is
no
sure
thing
there
is
almost
no
chance
that
the
senate
would
convict
him
republicans
hold
senate
seats
which
means
that
of
them
would
need
to
vote
along
with
democrats
in
order
for
kavanaugh
to
be
removed
short
of
some
hugely
damning
and
indisputably
true
new
facts
about
kavanaugh's
past
it's
impossible
to
see
such
a
thing
happening
all
of
which
means
that
no
matter
how
many
books
get
written
about
kavanaugh's
past
his
future
is
almost
certainly
on
the
supreme
court
