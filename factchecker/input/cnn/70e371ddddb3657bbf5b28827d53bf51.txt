cnn
a
federal
judge
has
temporarily
blocked
a
north
dakota
law
that
would
require
physicians
to
give
patients
what
doctors
say
is
inaccurate
information
about
abortion
specifically
that
the
effects
of
abortion
drugs
can
be
reversed
legislation
which
forces
physicians
to
tell
their
patients
as
part
of
informed
consent
that
it
may
be
possible
to
reverse
or
cure
an
ailment
disease
illness
surgical
procedure
or
the
effects
of
any
medication
in
the
absence
of
any
medical
or
scientific
evidence
to
support
such
a
message
is
unsound
misplaced
and
would
not
survive
a
constitutional
challenge
under

scrutiny

ama

welcomed
the
ruling
saying
that
open
honest
conversations
between
patients
and
physicians
are
the
cornerstone
of
medicine
with
this
ruling
physicians
in

will
not
be
forced
by

to
provide
patients
with
false
misleading
non-medical
information
about

that
contradicts
reality
and

she
added
marc
hearron
senior
counsel
at
the
center
for
reproductive
rights
praised
tuesday's
decision
when
across
the
country
doctors
are
being
used
as
political
pawns
in
the
attack
on
abortion
we
all
have
the
right
to
free
speech
and
to
speak
the
truth
that
doesn't
change
because
you're
a
doctor
who
provides
abortion
care
he
said
in
a
statement
today
the
court
stepped
in
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
these
physicians
in
the
initial
challenge
the
ama
argued
against
the
north
dakota
law
as
well
as
a
state
code
requiring
physicians
to
tell
patients
that
the
procedure
will
terminate
the
life
of
a
whole
separate
unique
living
human
being
the
requirements
infringe
on
providers
first
amendment
rights
by
forcing
medical
professionals
to
convey
a
claim
about
fetal
personhood
that
is
unmoored
from
medical
science
and
about
medication
abortion
that
is
wholly
unsupported
by
the
best
most
reliable
scientific
evidence
the
group
wrote
in
his
decision
tuesday
hovland
criticized
state
lawmakers
for
passing
the
measure
state
legislatures
should
not
be
mandating
unproven
medical
treatments
or
requiring
physicians
to
provide
patients
with
misleading
and
inaccurate
information
he
wrote
north
dakota
is
not
alone
in
its
law
nebraska
kentucky
oklahoma
and
arkansas
have
also
codified
measures
this
year
requiring
abortion
providers
to
tell
patients
that
medication
abortion
could
be
reversed
