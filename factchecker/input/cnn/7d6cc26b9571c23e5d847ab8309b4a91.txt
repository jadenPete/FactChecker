why
is
bernie
sanders
stuck
in
neutral
biden
sanders
and
warren
clash
over
health
care
cnn
something
has
happened
to
bernie
sanders
over
the
last
few
months
in
the
presidential
race
or
more
accurately
not
happened
sanders
the
self-described
vermont
democratic
socialist
is
stuck
in
neutral
and
that's
a
very
bad
place
to
be
with
the
day
when
actual
voters
will
cast
votes
is
getting
closer
and
closer
just
days
until
the
iowa
caucuses
take
the
nbc-wall
street
journal
poll
released
tuesday
night
it
showed
sanders
at
in
rd
place
but
trailing
both
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
by
double
digits
but
that
isn't
even
the
real
story
for
sanders
out
of
that
poll
it's
actually
this
while
biden
gained
five
points
from
a
similar
poll
in
july
and
warren
gained
six
sanders
support
stayed
right
where
it
was
up
only
a
single
point
from
the
summer
which
is
a
statistically
insignificant
change
and
this
is
far
from
the
only
poll
that
shows
the
sanders
stagnation
a
look
at
real
clear
politics
average
of
all
of
the
polling
conducted
in
the
democratic
primary
race
to
date
confirms
the
sanders
stall
in
the
spring
of
sanders
was
the
clear
nd
choice
to
biden
in
fact
all
the
way
through
early
june
biden
and
sanders
were
the
only
two
candidates
to
consistently
poll
in
double
digits
in
the
rcp
average
but
since
the
summer
sanders
has
flatlined
his
average
support
has
never
gone
higher
than
and
never
gone
lower
than
sanders
due
to
the
loyalty
of
his
most
ardent
supporters
has
always
had
a
very
high
floor
in
this
race
probably
right
around
but
what's
happened
over
these
last
few
months
is
the
emergence
of
what
looks
like
a
pretty
low
ceiling
for
sanders
support
in
the
race
first
poll
after
third
democratic
debate
shows
biden
leading
but
warren
rising
so
what
gives
the
short
answer
is
that
there
are
just
a
whole
lot
more
options
for
voters
in
this
election
than
there
were
in
the
democratic
primary
race
in
that
race
sanders
was
the
only
alternative
to
hillary
clinton
if
you
didn't
like
clinton
and
there
were
lots
of
democrats
in
that
camp
you
were
voting
for
sanders
period
and
sanders
clearly
benefited
from
that
dynamic
staying
in
the
race
all
the
way
through
the
final
primaries
in
june
before
bowing
out
amid
clinton's
insurmountable
delegate
lead
in
there
are
candidates
still
in
the
race
which
means
that
if
you
don't
like
say
biden
who
is
currently
the
frontrunner
there
are
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
other
options
not
named
bernie
sanders
to
choose
from
one
in
particular
warren
is
another
reason
that
sanders
seems
to
have
hit
a
bit
of
a
wall
warren's
candidacy
looks
a
lot
like
sanders
unapologetic
liberalism
in
support
of
broad
structural
change
in
politics
and
society
warren
supports
sanders
medicare
for
all
proposal
warren
and
sanders
are
both
prominent
supporters
of
the
green
new
deal
they
both
want
to
tax
the
wealthy
and
corporations
to
pay
for
their
proposals
the
problem
for
sanders
is
that
warren
is
surging
on
that
message
while
he
well
isn't
in
the
real
clear
politics
polling
average
warren
is
now
clear
of
sanders
for
nd
place
and
the
nbc-wsj
poll
put
her
at
the
highest
she's
been
in
any
hypothetical
national
polling
of
the
primary
what
explains
warren's
rise
on
what
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
sanders
message
voters
like
new
faces
sanders
ran
in
and
lots
of
democratic
voters
flocked
to
him
but
for
many
of
those
voters
it
may
be
a
been-there-done-that
situation
warren
is
in
their
minds
bernie
the
same
proposals
in
a
more
voter-friendly
and
electable
package
and
that
gets
at
the
more
fundamental
problem
for
sanders
the
people
who
love
him
love
him
exactly
because
he
doesn't
care
about
how
he
looks
perennially
unkempt
hair
or
what
he
sounds
like
very
very
shout-y
those
traits
make
him
authentic
and
different
to
them
they
love
him
because
of
it
not
in
spite
of
it
but
those
same
sanders-ian
traits
may
be
the
thing
keeping
him
from
growing
his
support
in
the
race
in
any
meaningful
way
if
you
are
a
democrat
and
are
relentlessly
focused
on
nominating
someone
who
can
beat
president
donald
trump
and
all
polling
i've
seen
suggests
that's
the
dominant
motivation
for
a
majority
of
party
voters
then
sanders
nutty-professor
profile
may
keep
you
from
jumping
on
board
there's
evidence
that
sanders
stall
in
polling
is
having
an
impact
earlier
this
week
he
replaced
his
new
hampshire
state
director
never
a
great
sign
with
the
primary
set
for
mid-february
on
monday
he
lost
the
endorsement
of
the
working
families
party
to
warren
working
families
endorsed
sanders
in
and
on
wednesday
sanders
iowa
state
director
confirmed
to
cnn
that
their
political
director
in
the
hawkeye
state
is
no
longer
with
the
campaign
now
it's
better
to
have
these
struggles
in
the
fall
of
an
off-year
rather
than
in
the
middle
of
primary
season
next
late
winter
early
spring
and
because
of
the
loyalty
of
sanders
core
backers
it's
hard
to
imagine
him
slipping
from
relevance
anytime
soon
but
his
struggle
to
attract
support
beyond
that
hardcore
uh
core
is
real
and
responsible
for
the
current
sanders
stagnation
in
the
race
update
this
story
has
been
updated
to
reflect
the
departure
of
sanders
campaign
political
director
in
iowa
