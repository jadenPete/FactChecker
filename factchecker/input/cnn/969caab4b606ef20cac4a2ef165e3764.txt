trump
revokes
waiver
for
california
to
set
higher
auto
emissions
standards
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
announced
wednesday
he
was
revoking
california's
authority
to
set
its
own
vehicle
emission
standards
the
latest
move
in
the
trump
administration's
ongoing
fight
with
the
golden
state
and
attempts
to
chip
away
at
former
president
barack
obama's
environmental
legacy
the
trump
administration
is
revoking
california's
federal
waiver
on
emissions
in
order
to
produce
far
less
expensive
cars
for
the
consumer
while
at
the
same
time
making
the
cars
substantially
safer
trump
tweeted
the
president
made
the
announcement
while
visiting
california
for
fundraisers
he
was
in
his
hotel
in
los
angeles
when
he
sent
the
tweets
california's
waiver
under
the
clean
air
act
allowed
it
to
set
standards
tighter
than
the
federal
standards
which
have
been
adopted
by
more
than
a
dozen
states
and
became
the
de-facto
nationwide
standard
because
automakers
do
not
design
different
sets
of
vehicles
to
meet
different
standards
in
different
states
the
trump
administration
has
long
been
at
odds
with
california
especially
on
environmental
issues
talks
between
california
environmental
regulators
and
the
administration
broke
down
earlier
this
year
yet
this
summer
the
state
negotiated
an
agreement
with
several
automakers
to
design
cars
to
meet
standards
higher
than
those
set
by
the
federal
government
gov
gavin
newsom
a
democrat
said
on
tuesday
the
trump
administration
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
the
rest
of
the
world
on
cutting
emissions
and
fighting
global
warming
and
is
acting
on
a
political
vendetta
the
state's
attorney
general
threatened
a
lawsuit
if
the
administration
goes
through
with
the
plan
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
at
a
news
conference
following
the
announcement
that
the
administration's
plan
is
desperate
the
trump
administration
is
also
working
on
replacing
obama-era
federal
vehicle-emission
standards
this
will
lead
to
more
production
because
of
this
pricing
and
safety
advantage
and
also
due
to
the
fact
that
older
highly
polluting
cars
will
be
replaced
by
new
extremely
environmentally
friendly
cars
trump
wrote
in
an
additional
tweet
there
will
be
very
little
difference
in
emissions
between
the
california
standard
and
the
new
u.s.
standard
but
the
cars
will
be
far
safer
and
much
less
expensive
many
more
cars
will
be
produced
under
the
new
and
uniform
standard
meaning
significantly
more
jobs
jobs
jobs
automakers
should
seize
this
opportunity
because
without
this
alternative
to
california
you
will
be
out
of
business
he
added
trump's
rollback
of
climate
change
regulations
will
be
felt
far
beyond
his
presidency
we
embrace
federalism
and
the
role
of
the
states
but
federalism
does
not
mean
that
one
state
can
dictate
standards
for
the
nation
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
tuesday
the
auto
alliance
an
industry
group
that
contends
the
obama-era
standards
were
unrealistic
said
it
would
take
a
closer
look
at
the
trump
administration's
approach
automakers
support
year-over-year
increases
in
fuel
economy
standards
that
align
with
marketplace
realities
and
we
support
one
national
program
as
the
best
path
to
preserve
good
auto
jobs
keep
new
vehicles
affordable
for
more
americans
and
avoid
a
marketplace
with
different
standards
said
dave
schwietert
the
group's
interim
ceo
and
president
jeff
alson
who
spent
four
decades
at
the
epa
including
in
the
office
of
transportation
and
air
quality
said
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
revoking
the
waiver
if
the
courts
allow
this
unprecedented
reversal
and
the
trump
epa
massively
rolls
back
the
federal
clean
car
standards
then
president
trump
will
have
done
more
to
destroy
the
planet
than
any
other
president
in
history
said
alson
who
is
now
with
the
environmental
protection
network
a
group
of
former
agency
employees
this
story
is
breaking
and
will
be
updated
correction
the
headline
has
been
changed
to
correctly
state
that
the
waiver
allowed
california
to
set
higher
emissions
standards
this
story
has
been
updated
to
correctly
spell
jeff
alson's
name
