judge
grills
prosecutors
and
considers
tossing
guilty
verdicts
in
mueller-tied
lobbying
case
alexandria
va
cnn
a
federal
judge
on
thursday
questioned
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
to
uphold
two
guilty
verdicts
in
a
foreign
lobbying
case
that
stemmed
from
the
russia
investigation
and
ensnarled
a
business
partner
of
former
trump
aide
michael
flynn
at
a
procedural
hearing
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
federal
judge
anthony
trenga
grilled
the
prosecutors
who
successfully
took
iranian-american
businessman
bijan
kian
to
trial
this
summer
kian
was
convicted
of
illegally
acting
as
a
foreign
agent
and
conspiring
to
hide
his
work
from
the
justice
department
fallout
from
pro-turkey
lobbying
he
did
with
flynn
in
the
judge
repeatedly
asked
tough
questions
and
pressed
prosecutors
for
details
proving
that
the
turkish
government
was
directly
involved
in
kian's
lobbying
campaign
and
said
some
evidence
presented
at
trial
suggested
there
was
a
lack
of
direction
or
control
by
turkey
the
judge's
questions
got
at
the
core
tenets
of
the
foreign
agents
laws
that
are
in
play
in
this
case
defense
attorney
james
tysse
said
no
reasonable
jury
could
ever
conclude
that
kian
was
directed
by
turkey
and
urged
trenga
to
toss
both
convictions
or
at
the
very
least
order
a
new
trial
trenga
said
he'd
make
a
ruling
as
soon
as
i
can
sentencing
is
scheduled
for
october
if
the
judge
throws
out
kian's
convictions
it
would
be
the
second
high-profile
defeat
for
the
justice
department's
newly
ramped-up
effort
to
crack
down
on
foreign
influence
which
was
spun
out
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
investigation
into
russian
meddling
it
would
also
tarnish
the
legacy
of
the
mueller
probe
which
uncovered
the
pro-turkey
lobbying
scheme
both
kian
and
flynn
have
ties
to
president
donald
trump
flynn
was
the
first
national
security
adviser
in
the
trump
white
house
and
kian
advised
the
trump
transition
team
on
national
security
matters
flynn
pleaded
guilty
in
to
lying
to
the
fbi
about
his
russian
contacts
and
admitted
in
his
cooperation
agreement
that
the
pro-turkey
lobbying
violated
federal
laws
for
foreign
agents
as
a
cooperator
flynn
was
slated
to
testify
against
kian
at
trial
but
those
plans
fell
apart
at
the
last
moment
after
a
public
and
heated
falling-out
between
flynn's
new
lawyers
and
the
prosecutors
but
without
flynn
as
their
star
witness
prosecutors
presented
a
slimmed-down
version
of
the
case
and
the
judge
previously
conceded
that
some
of
the
evidence
was
very
speculative
and
very
circumstantial
nonetheless
it
only
took
jurors
five
hours
to
return
two
guilty
verdicts
it's
common
for
defendants
in
criminal
cases
to
ask
judges
to
drop
the
charges
or
throw
out
a
jury
conviction
it's
rare
for
a
judge
to
grant
this
request
especially
after
the
jury
weighed
in
judges
are
rightly
very
reluctant
to
overturn
a
jury's
verdict
said
cnn
legal
analyst
elie
honig
a
former
federal
prosecutor
who
added
that
judges
consider
jury
decisions
as
sacred
