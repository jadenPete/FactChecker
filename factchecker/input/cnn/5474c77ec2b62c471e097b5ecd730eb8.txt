in
a
state
he
lost
in
yesterday
marked
the
beginning
of
hispanic
heritage
month
who
is
hispanic
he
said
to
loud
applause
pausing
for
a
few
moments
as
he
has
at
many
rallies
trump
touted
hispanic
american
employment
and
poverty
numbers
we
got
a
lot
of
hispanics
got
a
lot

trump
later
said
he
also
spent
time
during
the
rally
railing
at
the
new
york
times
handicapping
his
democratic
rivals
touting
the
us
car
industry
even
as
the
united
auto
workers
are
on
strike
lamenting
the
emoluments
clause
of
the
consitution
and
threatening
that
democrats
want
to
demolish
everything
that
republicans
have
gained
monday
night's
crowd
was
diverse
with
many
supporters
holding
latinos
for
trump
signs
distributed
by
the
campaign
which
encouraged
attendees
to
text
vamos
to
a
designated
number
viva
trump
a
pastor
said
after
delivering
the
invocation
earlier
monday
prompting
raucous
applause
from
the
crowd
trump
may
face
an
uphill
battle
in
courting
the
hispanic
vote
however
last
week's
cnn
ssrs
poll
showed
only
of
hispanics
approve
of
the
job
he's
doing
as
president
compared
with
two-thirds
who
disapprove
from
his
initial
campaign
speech
in
the
summer
of
in
which
he
railed
against
hispanic
undocumented
migrants
coming
into
the
us
and
promised
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
them
out
the
president
has
often
made
reducing
illegal
crossings
over
the
nation's
southern
border
a
key
focus
trump
has
made
many
policy
decisions
during
his
time
in
office
that
targeted
those
undocumented
people
who
cross
over
the
southern
border
who
are
overwhelmingly
from
central
and
south
american
among
them
have
been
the
separation
of
children
from
their
parents
after
an
illegal
border
crossing
which
has
since
been
discontinued
and
restricting
the
ability
of
individuals
who
make
it
to
claim
asylum
human
rights
groups
have
also
slammed
the
conditions
that
undocumented
migrants
face
in
detention
centers
after
they
are
arrested
for
crossing
the
border
illegally
it
was
trump's
first
trip
to
the
land
of
enchantment
as
president
and
a
sign
of
his
campaign's
promise
to
make
a
play
for
the
state
that
voted
decisively
democratic
in
the
president
kicked
off
a
three-day

campaign
claims
it
sees
signs
that
the
state
could
be
in
play
in
trump
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
remains
on
defense
after
scrutiny
over
financial
ties
i
think
new
mexico
is
a
state
that
trump's
policies
are
really
working
with
trump
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
last
week
parscale
said
that
trump's
policies
on
china
trade
and
immigration
in
particular
are
resonating
with
latino
voters
which
make
up
a
significant
portion
of
new
mexico's
voters
the
president
suggested
monday
that
border
security
was
appealing
to
hispanic
voters
when
he
first
started
talking
about
building
a
border
wall
trump
said
people
suggested
it
wouldn't
be
popular
with
hispanic
voters
people
said
oh
the
hispanics
he
said
but
trump
continued
hispanic
voters
understand
the
crisis
and
drugs
pouring
across
the
border
you
understand
that
when
other
people
don't
understand
it
he
told
the
crowd
we
saw
thousands
of
voters
who
did
not
vote
for
the
president
in
show
up
to
a
rally
register
come
in
line
parscale
said
adding
we
saw
thousands
of
latina
women
and
latinos
come
there
that
had
not
voted
for
him
in
who
were
not
only
anxious
to
vote
for
him
this
time
but
actually
come
see
him
and
rally
for
him
as
we
then
started
doing
poling
there
we
started
seeing
a
dramatic
increase
from
our
last
polling
from
parscale
said
he
showed
these
results
to
trump
and
he
was
in
agreement
with
me
let's
go
right
into
albuquerque
let's
go
into
new
mexico

they
had
gotten
one

the
best
responses

vowed
monday

would
be
victorious
in
new
mexico

will

said
he
later
acknowledged
it's
been
quite
a
while

won
this
state

really
think
we're
going
to
turn
this
state
and
make
it
a
republican
