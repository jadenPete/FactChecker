the
most
important
moment
of
the
houston
debate
got
totally
overlooked
booker
asked
if
biden
is
too
old
to
be
president
cnn
if
you
know
one
thing
about
last
week's
presidential
debate
it's
probably
this
juli
n
castro
seemed
to
question
joe
biden's
age
and
mental
acuity
by
repeatedly
asking
the
former
vice
president
if
he
was
forgetting
something
he
had
said
two
minutes
prior
and
that
was
important
but
it's
what
happened
after
the
debate
that
actually
might
tell
us
more
about
where
the
race
is
headed
and
how
soon
in
an
interview
after
the
debate
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
was
asked
by
cnn's
erin
burnett
about
castro's
hit
on
biden
and
booker
responded
this
way
i
think
that
we
are
at
a
tough
point
right
now
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
joe
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
and
i
think
that
castro
has
some
legitimate
concerns
about
can
he
be
someone
in
a
long
grueling
campaign
that
can
get
the
ball
over
the
line
and
he
has
every
right
to
call
that
out
which
is
well
verrrrrrrry
interesting
here's
why
follow
the
trail
of
democratic
candidates
raising
questions
of
biden's
competence
it
started
a
few
weeks
back
with
ohio
rep
tim
ryan
a
very
long
shot
for
the
nomination
and
that
is
being
kind
i
just
think
biden
is
declining
ryan
told
bloomberg
earlier
this
month
i
don't
think
he
has
the
energy
you
see
it
almost
daily
and
i
love
the
guy
then
days
later
castro
a
more
viable
candidate
but
nonetheless
still
at
the
outer
fringes
of
the
race
picked
up
the
baton
and
carried
it
with
this
attack
on
biden's
health
care
plan
during
last
thursday's
debate
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
two
minutes
ago
i
mean
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
you're
forgetting
that
and
then
immediately
after
the
debate
booker
an
even
more
viable
democratic
candidate
defended
castro
and
suggested
that
biden
may
not
be
someone
who
can
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
it's
not
hard
to
see
what
happening
here
the
attacks
on
biden's
acuity
are
a
speeding
up
rapidly
and
b
being
picked
up
by
more
and
more
viable
candidates
for
the
nomination
follow
that
path
and
you
get
this
sometime
soon
one
of
biden's
main
rivals
for
the
nomination
will
raise
in
an
a-lot-of-people-are-asking-about-this
soft
sell
whether
biden
is
up
to
the
rigors
of
this
campaign
and
the
prospect
of
taking
on
president
donald
trump
next
fall
biden
has
to
date
been
able
to
dismiss
the
attacks
on
his
abilities
under
the
guise
of
not
punching
down
responding
to
castro's
questions
about
his
competence
would
be
to
give
the
former
san
antonio
mayor
exactly
what
he
wants
and
so
biden
generally
just
ignores
it
ditto
ryan
and
maybe
even
booker
so
far
biden
has
mostly
talked
in
general
terms
about
questions
regarding
his
age
and
health
i
think
it's
totally
appropriate
for
people
to
look
at
my
age
biden
said
in
new
hampshire
earlier
this
month
just
like
when
i
was
was
i
old
enough
and
now
am
i
fit
enough
i'll
completely
disclose
everything
about
my
health
i'm
in
good
shape
after
the
houston
debate
biden
answered
a
question
about
his
health
with
a
joke
what
health
concerns
man
he
said
to
a
reporter
you
want
to
wrestle
biden's
campaign
confirmed
that
he
will
release
a
full
medical
report
before
the
iowa
caucuses
which
are
scheduled
for
february
it
now
appears
to
be
a
question
of
when
not
if
biden's
age
and
health
become
a
central
issue
in
the
democratic
nomination
fight
and
my
bet
is
sooner
rather
than
later
