takes
jab
at
joe
biden's
memory
cnn
democratic
candidates
pushed
back
against
juli
n
castro
going
after
joe
biden's
memory
in
thursday's
presidential
debate
calling
it
personal
and
not
cool
castro
sharply
accused
the
former
vice
president
of
forgetting
what
he'd
said
just
minutes
before
during
a
disagreement
over
a
minor
point
in
the
candidates
broader
discussion
of
whether
to
embrace
medicare
for
all
which
biden
has
opposed
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
a
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
said
to
biden
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
forgetting
that
we
need
a
health
care
system
where
you're
automatically
enrolled
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
cut
in
saying
this
is
why
presidential
debates
are
becoming
unwatchable
he
continued
this
reminds
everybody
of
what
they
cannot
stand
about
washington
scoring
points
against
each
other
poking
at
each
other
castro
replied
that's
called
the
democratic
primary
election
pete
that's
called
an
election
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
then
responded
but
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
and
that
is
not
how
we're
going
to
win
this
election
castro
told
cnn's
chris
cuomo
after
the
debate
that
the
comment
was
not
intended
as
a
personal
attack
or
affront
this
is
a
debate
and
when
we're
talking
about
health
care
policy
we're
talking
about
a
policy
that
impacts
every
single
person
in
this
country
castro
said
castro
added
on
friday
that
he
would've
asked
the
same
question
of
any
of
the
other
candidates
had
they
denied
a
comment
they
made
within
minutes
it
didn't
matter
that
it
was
joe
biden
if
it
had
been
another
candidate
that
tried
to
deny
what
they
just
said
two
minutes
ago
i
would
have
asked
them
the
same
thing
castro
said
on
cnn's
new
day
in
interviews
with
cnn
immediately
following
the
debate
democratic
candidates
expressed
disapproval
of
castro's
tactic
and
stressed
the
importance
of
party
unity
klobuchar
said
castro's
attack
was
not
cool
and
so
personal
and
so
unnecessary
she
said
it
feels
like
something
that
donald
trump
might
tweet
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
said
he
is
going
to
continue
to
contrast
his
views
and
record
with
biden's
but
that
i'm
not
going
to
go
after
him
personally
that's
not
right
buttigieg
said
it
was
starting
to
feel
like
a
scrum
up
there
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
said
he
is
going
to
stand
up
against
any
kind
of
demeaning
and
degrading
between
candidates
adding
i've
seen
this
movie
before
in
the
last
election
cnn's
dana
bash
pointed
out
that
booker
had
been
tough
on
biden
in
the
last
democratic
debate
where
the
senator
delivered
one
of
the
most
forceful
denunciations
of
biden's
record
and
suggested
he
former
vice
president
had
been
one
of
the
chief
architects
of
a
criminal
justice
system
that
disproportionately
incarcerated
black
and
brown
men
booker
responded
absolutely
but
you
saw
the
way
i
did
it
it
wasn't
a
cheap
shot
castro
has
some
really
legitimate
concerns
that
are
shared
by
many
others
he
said
about
biden's
ability
to
carry
the
ball
all
the
way
across
the
end
line
without
fumbling
booker
said
castro
has
every
right
to
call
that
out
but
the
senator
stressed
the
importance
of
tone
and
tenor
and
disagreeing
respectfully
when
you
demonize
somebody
and
create
bad
blood
it's
hard
to
unify
afterwards
he
said
sen
kamala
harris
whose
confrontation
of
biden
in
the
first
debate
earned
her
a
boost
in
the
polls
said
the
focus
should
instead
be
on
what
we
need
to
do
to
prosecute
the
case
against
donald
trump
it's
a
debate
stage
things
get
heated
the
california
senator
said
friday
on
cnn's
new
day
adding
that
the
focus
needs
to
be
on
the
fact
that
donald
trump
is
not
doing
the
american
people
the
benefit
of
the
office
