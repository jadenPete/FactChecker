field
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
on
sunday
evening
tweeted
that
the
us
has
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
who
is
responsible
for
an
attack
on
a
saudi
arabian
oil
field
and
the
country
is
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
following
the
crippling
strike
saudi
arabia
oil
supply
was
attacked
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
trump
said
trump's
tweet
which
appeared
to
raise
the
specter
of
a
us
military
response
served
to
ratchet
up
tensions
in
a
region
already
on
edge
after
saturday's
audacious
attack
on
the
saudi
oil
field
marc
short
the
vice
president's
chief
of
staff
told
reporters
monday
morning
that
the
president's
claim
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
may
not
refer
to
military
action
i
think
that
locked
and
loaded
is
a
broad
term
and
talks
about
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
short
said
this
is
not
the
s
oil
embargo
it's
not
when
iraq
invaded
kuwait
we're
now
a
net
oil
exporter
which
means
that
the
american
market
is
much
better
protected
trump
used
similar
language
in
june
when
he
announced
he
had
called
off
an
attack
on
iran
just
as
the
us
was
cocked
loaded
to
strike
because
he
decided
it
would
cause
too
many
deaths
for
a
proportionate
response
to
tehran's
downing
of
a
us
drone
on
saturday
coordinated
strikes
on
key
saudi
arabian
oil
facilities
among
the
world's
largest
energy
production
centers
disrupted
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
yemen's
houthi
rebels
took
responsibility
for
the
attacks
but
they
are
often
backed
by
iran
oil
prices
surge
and
trump
says
he
has
ordered
use
of
emergency
supplies
though
trump
did
not
name
iran
in
his
tweet
the
attack
has
caused
another
spike
in
tensions
between
the
us
and
tehran
prior
to
saturday
there
were
signs
the
us
appeared
open
to
new
negotiations
and
even
a
potential
meeting
later
this
month
between
trump
and
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
a
day
after
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
blamed
iran
for
the
attack
on
saudi
oil
facilities
and
argued
there
is
no
evidence
the
attacks
came
from
yemen
a
senior
administration
official
briefed
cnn
on
information
to
back
up
pompeo's
claims
pompeo
did
not
provide
evidence
but
the
official
pointed
to
satellite
imagery
provided
to
cnn
showing
the
oil
facilities
were
struck
from
the
northwest
suggesting
an
attack
from
iraq
or
iran
among
other
information
short
said
monday
he's
quite
confident
that
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
will
release
evidence
backing
up
his
claim
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
on
an
oil
facility
in
saudi
arabia
there's
no
doubt
that
iran
has
been
a
malign
actor
on
the
stage
here
and
has
been
supporting
the
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
but
i
think
there's
certainly
greater
evidence
that
he'll
be
sharing
that
directly
ties
these
attacks
to
iran
short
said
on
saturday
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
seyyed
abbas
mousavi
rejected
the
accusation
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
such
blind
accusations
and
inappropriate
comments
in
a
diplomatic
context
are
incomprehensible
and
meaningless
he
said
adding
even
hostility
needs
a
certain
degree
of
credibility
and
reasonable
frameworks
us
officials
have
also
violated
these
basic
principles
iran's
foreign
minister
took
to
twitter
to
issue
a
similar
denial
having
failed
at
max
pressure
secpompeo's
turning
to
max
deceit
javad
zarif
wrote
us
its
clients
are
stuck
in
yemen
because
of
illusion
that
weapon
superiority
will
lead
to
military
victory
blaming
iran
won't
end
disaster
accepting
our
april
proposal
to
end
war
begin
talks
may
trump
tweeted
later
sunday
that
it
is
incorrect
to
say
he
is
willing
to
meet
with
iran
no
condition
a
contradiction
of
his
own
administration
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
thursday
that
the
president
has
said
he
would
sit
down
with
rouhani
with
no
conditions
points
of
impact
the
official
pointed
to
the
angle
at
which
saudi
oil
facilities
were
attacked
the
numbers
of
points
of
impact
and
other
information
to
argue
that
it
is
unlikely
the
attacks
were
carried
out
by
yemen
instead
the
official
suggested
the
attack
most
likely
originated
in
iran
or
iraq
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
these
things
could
have
come
from
anywhere
but
iran
or
iraq
the
senior
administration
official
said
the
official
said
saudi
targets
were
struck
in
saturday's
attack
and
argued
that
such
an
attack
could
not
be
carried
out
with
drones
which
the
houthis
claimed
to
have
used
you
can't
hit
targets
with
drones
like
that
the
official
said
the
official
drawing
on
commercial
satellite
imagery
shared
with
cnn
also
noted
that
all
the
points
of
impact
on
saudi
facilities
were
on
the
northwest
side
of
them
which
is
somewhat
difficult
to
do
from
yemen
the
official
could
not
say
whether
it's
possible
drones
from
yemen
could
have
angled
around
to
attack
northwest
facilities
saudi
attack
likely
originated
in
iran
or
iraq
senior
administration
official
says
military
experts
examine
commercial
satellite
images
three
cnn
military
experts
have
examined
the
private
satellite
photos
ret
col
cedric
leighton
who
is
an
intelligence
expert
with
a
focus
in
imagery
said
the
images
do
help
support
the
trump
administration's
claim
that
the
drones
likely
came
from
iraq
or
iran
but
cautioned
that
they're
not
definitive
this
is
the
handiwork
of
a
sophisticated
most
likely
state
actor
the
precise
nature
of
the
intelligence
used
to
conduct
targeting
the
mission
planning
that
went
into
this
to
avoid
radar
detection
as
well
as
the
selection
of
the
targets
shows
a
robust
capability
that
would
most
likely
be
the
work
of
a
government
or
government-sponsored
group
leighton
told
cnn
sunday
the
drones
most
likely
originated
in
either
southern
iraq
or
iran
he
said
attack
on
saudi
oil
field
a
game-changer
in
gulf
confrontation
ret
gen
mark
hertling
said
the
images
really
don't
show
anything
other
than
pretty
good
accuracy
on
the
strike
of
the
oil
tanks
ret
adm
john
kirby
echoed
this
point
stating
there
is
nothing
i
see
in
these
pictures
which
confirms
a
launch
from
any
particular
location
i'm
struck
by
the
precision
of
the
strikes
almost
pin-prick
kirby
said
certainly
possible
with
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
but
again
that
doesn't
really
confirm
anything
iran's
response
rouhani
did
not
specifically
reference
the
attack
on
the
saudi
arabia's
oil
facilities
in
an
address
on
iran's
press
tv
sunday
but
did
accuse
americans
of
running
a
war
operation
by
supporting
the
uae
and
saudi
arabia
transferring
weapons
and
providing
intelligence
what
is
happening
in
this
region
today
has
created
concern
among
majority
of
world
countries
he
said
earlier
sunday
white
house
senior
counselor
kellyanne
conway
said
trump
has
many
options
on
the
table
when
it
comes
to
responding
to
the
strike
on
saudi
arabia's
oil
production
this
weekend
the
president
will
always
consider
his
options
conway
said
on
fox
news
sunday
when
asked
if
trump
would
still
sit
down
with
rouhani
under
current
circumstances
we've
never
committed
to
that
meeting
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
the
president's
just
said
he's
looking
at
it
