the
racial
politics
of
gun
control
washington
cnn
when
americans
talk
about
guns
what's
arguably
most
interesting
isn't
what
we
say
about
the
devices
themselves
it's
what
we
betray
about
whose
voices
and
lives
matter
when
it
comes
to
our
country's
virulent
gun
culture
indeed
the
heartbreaking
permanence
of
the
school
shooting
reality
is
undeniable
when
watching
sandy
hook
promise's
wrenching
new
back-to-school
psa
which
forces
viewers
to
come
to
grips
with
present-day
america
for
school
children
the
heightened
concern
over
mass
shootings
in
schools
is
something
dave
chappelle
satirizes
in
his
controversial
new
netflix
stand-up
special
that
highlights
a
harsh
truth
about
america's
relationship
with
gun
control
one
of
its
few
moments
of
insight
arrives
during
the
comic's
discussion
of
gun
violence
in
particular
he
subtly
gets
at
a
key
trend
how
much
the
messaging
on
gun
regulation
on
the
whole
has
changed
in
recent
decades
shooting
up
schools
is
a
white
kid's
game
i
hated
school
too
it
never
occurred
to
me
kill
everybody
in
school
it's
f
ing
crazy
chappelle
says
decades
ago
when
congress
actually
passed
an
assault
weapons
ban
that
notably
was
allowed
to
expire
in
the
broad
concern
was
around
guns
in
the
hands
of
minorities
black
americans
specifically
our
modern
congress
finds
itself
paralyzed
now
that
we're
increasingly
facing
a
different
dimension
of
the
issue
white
people's
guns
and
the
consequences
of
their
contested
rights
to
have
them
understanding
this
shift
requires
looking
back
at
the
social
and
political
pieties
that
helped
to
spur
america's
contemporary
gun-rights
movement
consider
how
fear
of
the
black
panthers
motivated
conservative
politicians
even
the
national
rifle
association
to
push
for
stricter
gun
control
in
the
s
the
panthers
frustrated
by
the
country's
repeated
failure
to
protect
its
black
citizens
advocated
for
black
self-defense
via
gun
ownership
and
copwatching
to
no
one's
surprise
the
backlash
against
this
vision
of
protection
was
swift
in
in
response
to
the
panthers
activities
then-gov
ronald
reagan
signed
the
mulford
act
named
after
republican
assemblyman
don
mulford
and
which
repealed
a
california
law
that
permitted
people
to
carry
loaded
firearms
in
public
of
the
bill
reagan
said
later
that
it'd
work
no
hardship
on
the
honest
citizen
this
citizen
we
can
assume
was
white
sandy
hook
promise's
chilling
back-to-school
psa
hopes
to
prevent
mass
shootings
crucially
while
unthinkable
today
the
nra's
position
on
gun
regulation
until
the
late
s
when
more
and
more
white
people
began
viewing
guns
as
a
means
of
protecting
themselves
and
their
status
was
noticeably
divorced
from
second
amendment
arguments
as
adam
winkler
a
professor
at
the
ucla
school
of
law
charts
how
distant
all
that
seems
now
these
days
despite
a
bit
of
a
resurgence
in
black
gun
ownership
the
face
of
the
gun-rights
advocate
has
changed
rural
white
conservatives
are
now
among
the
most
vocal
proponents
take
for
instance
missouri
where
in
the
past
two
decades
an
increasingly
conservative
and
pro-gun
legislature
and
citizenry
had
relaxed
limitations
governing
practically
every
aspect
of
buying
owning
and
carrying
firearms
in
the
state
writes
jonathan
m.
metzl
a
professor
of
sociology
and
psychiatry
at
vanderbilt
university
in
his
new
book
dying
of
whiteness
how
the
politics
of
racial
resentment
is
killing
america's
heartland
compare
this
to
the
rhetoric
of
the
s
when
in
signing
what
became
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
which
contained
the
aforementioned
federal
assault
weapons
ban
former
president
bill
clinton
said
gangs
and
drugs
have
taken
over
our
streets
and
undermined
our
schools
it's
the
difference
between
vanquishing
the
specter
of
black
criminality
seen
in
gangs
and
the
weapons
associated
with
them
and
protecting
the
property
of
white
conservatives
or
put
another
way
the
hypocrisy
around
gun
ownership
in
america
is
a
broadcast
of
something
indisputably
fundamental
the
country's
struggle
to
bolster
a
racial
hierarchy
there
was
a
nod
to
this
knotty
history
at
the
democratic
debate
in
september
when
cory
booker
new
jersey's
junior
senator
and
a
presidential
candidate
mentioned
how
even
though
gun
violence
had
long
afflicted
areas
of
the
state
it
was
often
ignored
until
it
crept
into
other
presumably
whiter
neighborhoods
we're
never
going
to
solve
this
crisis
if
we
have
to
wait
for
it
to
personally
affect
us
or
our
neighborhood
or
our
community
before
we
demand
action
booker
said
in
washington
it's
still
an
open
question
as
to
whether
lawmakers
will
make
any
headway
on
the
issue
given
the
white
house's
waffling
on
proposals
such
as
expanding
background
checks
chappelle's
solution
though
every
able-bodied
african
american
must
register
for
a
legal
firearm
that's
the
only
way
they'll
change
the
law
he
says
chappelle
may
be
half-
kidding
but
in
his
gag
is
also
a
history
that
reveals
more
about
the
politics
of
gun
regulation
in
america
than
the
words
of
most
politicians
