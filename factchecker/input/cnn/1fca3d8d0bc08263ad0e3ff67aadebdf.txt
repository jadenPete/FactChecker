policy
harrisburg
catholic
elementary
school
in
harrisburg
pennsylvania
is
slated
to
host
the

according
to
a
department
press
release
and
is
subject
to
the
diocese
of
harrisburg's
student
policy
on
gender
identity
questions
the
policy
characterizes
gender-affirming
surgery
an
option
for
some
transgender
individuals
as
understood
in
catholic
moral
terms
as
self-mutilation
and
therefore
immoral
to
attempt
to
make
accommodations
for
such
persons
would
be
to
cooperate
in
the
immoral
action
and
impose
an
unacceptable
burden
on
others
in
the
school
community
the
policy
reads
the
policy
asserts
that
catholic
school
students
parents
agree
that
they
will
not
publicly
act
in
opposition
to
catholic
teaching
notification
of
a
student's
determination
to
undergo
a
sex
change
procedure
or
that
a
student
has
undergone
the
procedure
would
violate
that
agreement
the
policy
continues
the
student
would
be
ineligible
to
attend
or
remain
in
attendance
in
a
catholic
school

at
the
time
the

said
she
was

been
mixed
on
transgender

of
transgender
students
are
protected
by
court
precedent
and
the
law
devos
again
cited
mixed
court
rulings
and
said
