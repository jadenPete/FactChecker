texas
democratic
rep
vicente
gonzalez
on
sunday
flipped
his
support
from
juli
n
castro
to
joe
biden
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
saying
now
is
the
time
to
narrow
the
field
and
unite
as
democrats
the
switch
of
support
comes
days
after
castro
sharply
criticized
biden
with
an
apparent
jab
at
the
former
vice
president's
memory
in
a
contentious
moment
dubbed
personal
and
not
cool
by
other
candidates
but
gonzalez
said
that
debate
moment
was
not
the
reason
behind
his
decision
castro's
delivery
could
have
been
different
gonzalez
told
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
state
of
the
union
but
the
congressman
said
most
of
what
he
saw
on
the
debate
stage
was
fair
game
in
moving
the
process
forward
still
the
democratic
party
needs
to
narrow
the
person
field
to
be
successful
he
said
we
need
to
narrow
the
field
and
unite
as
democrats
to
defeat
president
donald
trump
in
november
that's
why
i
believe
i'm
moving
my
support
to
vice
president
joe
biden
gonzalez
who
represents
the
texas
th
congressional
district
said
joe
biden
elizabeth
warren
and
bernie
sanders
commit
to
releasing
medical
records
early
gonzalez
called
the
former
vice
president
a
steady
ship
with
white
house
experience
who
can
defeat
trump
he
called
castro
a
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
under
the
obama
administration
and
former
mayor
of
san
antonio
texas
a
qualified
candidate
but
said
there
are
a
number
of
qualified
candidates
if
you're
polling
in
the
low
single
digits
and
you're
not
raising
resources
i
mean
it's
clearly
a
recipe
for
disaster
gonzalez
said
in
response
to
the
pulled
endorsement
castro
campaign
spokesman
sawyer
hackett
said
congressman
gonz
lez

whichever
candidate
he
feels
represents
his
values
secretary
castro
will
continue
to
fight

a
better
future
for
all

system
that

have
access
to
quality

sharply
accused
the
former

of
forgetting
what
he'd
said
just
minutes
before
during
a
disagreement
over
a
minor
point
in
the
candidates
broader
discussion
of
whether
to
embrace
medicare
for
all
which
biden
has
opposed
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
castro
said
to
biden
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
forgetting
that
we
need
a
health
care
system
where
you're
automatically
enrolled
the
congressman
said
he
recently
met
with
biden
and
said
he
is
in

health
and
mentally
sharp

a
lot
healthier
than
donald

of
his
democratic

the
oldest
president
at
the
beginning
of
his
first
term
in

that
people
make
mistakes
and
misspeak

but
for
the
most
part
biden

sharp
he's
on
target
when
you
meet
with
him
personally
he's
clearly
in
physically
good
shape
