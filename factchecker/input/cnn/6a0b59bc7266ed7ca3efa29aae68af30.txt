the
most
overblown
lines
from
donald
trump's
baltimore
speech
cnn
while
democrats
spent
two-plus
hours
thursday
night
making
the
case
for
why
they
are
uniquely
suited
to
beating
donald
trump
in
the
president
traveled
to
baltimore
to
do
what
he
does
best
throw
red
meat
to
adoring
fans
in
this
case
the
fans
were
house
republicans
who
were
in
baltimore
a
city
trump
referred
to
as
a
rodent
and
rat-infested
mess
over
the
summer
for
their
annual
retreat
trump's
speech
which
ran
for
minutes
was
a
sort
of
greatest
hits
album
for
the
president
as
he
railed
against
paper
straws
windmills
and
always
always
always
democrats
below
the
most
er
notable
lines
from
trump's
speech
winning
is
a
good
thing
isn't
it
winning
it's
a
good
thing
i
for
one
am
not
bored
of
winning
like
at
all
and
away
we
go
a
man
who
was
not
expected
necessarily
to
win
and
then
he
got
in
gear
and
he
was
brutal
and
brilliant
and
he
did
a
great
job
now
soon-to-be
and
now
congressman
dan
bishop
bishop
who
won
the
th
district
special
election
in
north
carolina
earlier
this
week
was
running
in
a
district
that
trump
carried
by
points
in
and
which
has
not
been
represented
in
congress
by
a
democrat
since
the
early
s
they
turned
out
and
they
turned
out
like
people
never
expected
and
they
were
that
was
just
a
great
evening
of
television
trump
is
talking
here
i
think
about
the
coverage
of
the
north
carolina
special
election
regardless
it
serves
as
a
good
reminder
that
his
lens
on
literally
everything
is
cable
television
our
nation
is
stronger
today
than
ever
before
we
have
the
greatest
equipment
our
equipment
is
truly
great
some
say
the
greatest
in
the
history
of
equipment
ever
but
we
now
have
the
greatest
equipment
when
i
came
in
two-and-a-half
years
ago
our
equipment
was
old
and
tired
no
one
wants
old
and
tired
equipment
no
one
we
are
really
if
you
look
at
what's
going
on
in
certain
countries
in
the
middle
east
and
you
look
at
the
straits
and
you
see
the
ships
and
they're
being
taken
and
they're
being
not
too
often
by
the
way
because
frankly
iran
is
a
much
different
country
than
it
was
two-and-a-half
years
ago
a
truly
amazing
word
salad
we've
had
tremendous
success
with
opioid
with
opioid
huh
thanks
to
the
entire
republican
team
in
congress
we
passed
the
biggest
tax
cut
and
reform
in
american
history
this
is
false
it
was
not
the
largest
tax
cut
in
history
we're
taking
in
billions
and
billions
of
tariffs
and
they're
eating
the
cost
this
is
not
being
born
very
much
by
us
they're
eating
the
cost
trump's
claim
that
china
is
paying
for
the
tariffs
is
simply
wrong
us
companies
and
consumers
pay
for
them
we
have
done
things
that
very
very
few
have
even
thought
about
doing
but
we
also
need
to
prepare
for
the
coming
fight
because
the
traditions
and
beliefs
that
have
made
the
american
dream
possible
are
under
attack
like
never
before
sadly
the
american
dream
is
dead
donald
trump
announcing
his
candidacy
for
president
in
it's
very
hard
to
beat
a
socialist
when
you
have
a
very
wealthy
country
i
was
not
aware
of
that
and
then
they
talk
about
plastic
straws
i
said
what
about
the
plate
what
about
the
wrapper
that's
made
out
of
a
much
tougher
plastic
boom
roasted
take
that
environmentalists
the
bulb
that
we're
being
forced
to
use
number
one
most
importantly
the
light's
no
good
i
always
look
orange
and
so
do
you
the
light
is
the
worst
i
always
look
orange
the
president
of
the
united
states
context
the
trump
administration
rolled
back
standards
on
energy-efficient
light
bulbs
earlier
this
month
it's
gases
inside
and
read
what
they
say
if
it
breaks
bring
it
to
your
local
whatever
have
it
wrapped
have
it
this
what
are
we
doing
what
are
we
doing
i
was
just
wondering
the
same
thing
he's
still
talking
about
light
bulbs
no
more
cows
no
more
planes
i
guess
no
more
people
right
because
kevin
is
just
like
a
cow
he's
just
smaller
donald
trump
on
the
green
new
deal
and
also
on
house
minority
leader
kevin
mccarthy's
similarities
to
a
bovine
they're
standing
behind
aoc
i
call
her
cortez
because
you
don't
have
enough
time
to
go
through
the
whole
name
i
just
go
cortez
they
don't
like
that
when
you
call
her
cortez
but
her
name's
cortez
too
too
long
uh
huh
tell
me
more
about
this
naming
theory
can
you
imagine
those
two
guys
in
a
room
here's
xi
and
here's
sleepy
joe
what
where
am
i
where
am
i
just
sign
here
sleepy
joe
just
sign
here
donald
trump
on
what
a
summit
between
the
chinese
president
and
the
democratic
frontrunner
might
look
like
totally
normal
stuff
because
one
thing
i've
learned
about
politics
you
can
say
something
one
day
that's
just
absolutely
insane
like
they're
saying
and
then
about
two
weeks
later
say
the
exact
opposite
and
nobody
will
ever
even
call
you
on
it
that
sounds
a
lot
like
a
certain
politician
i
know
even
though
i
guess
they
should
be
watching
the
debate
but
they're
probably
watching
us
but
we
have
a
lot
see
those
cameras
back
there
we
kept
the
reporters
out
but
we
have
those
cameras
see
those
red
bulbs
your
regular
reminder
that
trump
cares
deeply
and
passionately
about
his
media
coverage
political
death
for
trump
isn't
bad
press
it's
no
press
he
lives
in
terror
of
being
irrelevant
she
didn't
like
stairs
she
didn't
like
air
she
didn't
like
a
lot
hillary
clinton
didn't
like
stairs
or
air
how
did
she
feel
about
fairs
or
hares
look
in
truth
i
don't
care
the
winner
of
wisconsin
is
donald
trump
the
election
ended
days
ago
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
michigan
donald
trump
has
won
the
great
state
of
pennsylvania
great
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
great
state
of
florida
the
great
state
of
south
carolina
ah
yes
south
carolina
that
critical
general
election
battleground
i
wish
we
could
wear
them
nobody
would
ever
look
at
my
hair
and
criticize
me
i'd
wear
that
hat
i'd
never
take
it
off
donald
trump
on
cowboy
hats
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
hairspray
don't
have
to
worry
about
my
hair
blowing
beautifully
blowing
in
the
wind
what's
that
about
hair
blowing
beautifully
in
the
wind
i
don't
think
rockefeller
can
beat
me
in
texas
the
real
rockefeller
the
first
rockefeller
i
think
he'd
have
a
hard
time
beating
me
in
texas
well
john
d.
rockefeller
was
from
new
york
so
meanwhile
democrats
want
to
confiscate
guns
from
law-abiding
americas
so
they're
totally
defenseless
when
somebody
walks
into
their
house
with
a
gun
it's
like
whatever
you
want
whatever
you
want
i'm
defenseless
whatever
you
want
how
crazy
is
this
this
isn't
true
no
democratic
candidate
is
proposing
total
gun
confiscation
but
beto
o'rourke's
pledge
to
conduct
a
mandatory
buyback
of
assault
weapons
during
thursday
night's
debate
will
soon
become
a
trump
talking
point
i
guarantee
it
you
know
the
republican
party
is
actually
loved
in
this
country
and
i
think
in
a
certain
way
loved
like
never
before
because
they
see
that
we're
fighting
for
this
country
we're
fighting
for
what
we
grew
up
with
what
the
the
values
that
we
want
not
close
to
true
neither
national
political
party
is
terribly
popular
but
republicans
are
especially
un-liked
just
more
than
in
people
had
a
favorable
view
of
the
gop
in
gallup
polling
earlier
this
year
i
said
it's
hard
to
impeach
somebody
who
didn't
do
anything
wrong
the
mueller
report
is
out
there's
no
collusion
after
two
and
a
half
years
generally
true
but
no
mention
by
trump
of
the
repeated
incidents
in
the
report
where
he
appeared
to
engage
in
obstructive
behavior
to
block
or
slow
the
mueller
probe
try
dropping
a
windmill
someplace
close
to
your
house
try
selling
your
house
they
make
noise
they
kill
all
the
birds
trump's
war
on
windmills
is
one
of
the
very
few
things
he
has
been
consistent
on
throughout
his
life
that's
why
people
are
loving
the
republican
party
again
again
no
at
least
according
to
polling
we're
going
to
win
so
much
we're
going
to
win
win
win
that's
three
wins
or
is
it
winning
times
three
mind
blown
we're
going
to
keep
winning
winning
winning
yes
you
just
said
that
we're
going
to
keep
winning
winning
winning
this
is
not
the
same
quote
he
actually
said
it
again
this
feels
like
a
good
place
to
end
