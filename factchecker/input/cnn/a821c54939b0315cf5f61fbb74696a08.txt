extra

insufficient

lawmakers
furious
over
diverted
military
funding
washington
cnn
the
defense
department
has
decided
not
to
proceed
with
three
border
wall
projects
in
california
and
arizona
citing
insufficient
contract
savings
according
to
a
court
filing
the
move
appears
to
be
a
setback
for
president
donald
trump
who
has
sparked
controversy
for
dipping
into
pentagon
funds
to
build
his
signature
border
wall
though
it's
unclear
what
will
happen
to
the
projects
listed
in
the
filing
last
month
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
approved
an
additional
miles
of
foot-high
barriers
for
the
southern
border
using
billion
in
funds
redirected
from
a
counter
drug
account
which
is
authorized
to
spend
money
on
border
barrier
construction
for
the
purpose
of
blocking
drug-smuggling
corridors
although
then-acting
defense
secretary
patrick
shanahan
had
earlier
approved
some
miles
of
fencing
requested
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
in
the
yuma
el
paso
and
tucson
sectors
the
cost
of
constructing
that
section
of
the
border
wall
was
less
than
originally
anticipated
freeing
up
funds
to
support
the
additional
miles
approved
by
esper
the
pentagon
notified
the
court
of
the
additional
miles
at
the
time
noting
the
army
corps
wouldn't
know
the
exact
amount
of
savings
to
move
forward
with
the
projects
until
later
in
the
fiscal
year
monday's
court
filing
however
reveals
that
there
were
not
enough
funds
to
cover
the
costs
of
the
projects
based
on
its
work
in
definitizing
the
contracts
for
the
original
section
projects
the
army
corps
has
determined
that
there
are
insufficient
contract
savings
to
undertake
the
three
additional
section
projects
authorized
by
the
secretary
of
defense
on
august
the
filing
reads
therefore
the
department
of
defense
has
decided
not
to
pursue
yuma
sector
projects
and
and
tucson
sector
project
at
this
time
the
president's
decision
to
tap
into
pentagon
funds
for
his
wall
has
been
legally
challenged
by
the
democratic-controlled
house
and
advocacy
groups
in
july
the
supreme
court
cleared
the
way
for
the
trump
administration
to
use
billion
from
the
defense
department
to
construct
parts
of
a
wall
along
the
southwestern
border
that
the
government
argues
is
necessary
to
protect
national
security
the
decision
allows
the
defense
department
money
to
be
spent
now
while
a
court
battle
plays
out
over
whether
the
government
had
the
authority
to
divert
funds
that
were
not
appropriated
for
the
wall
the
administration
is
using
funds
appropriated
for
the
wall
as
well
as
defense
department
funds
to
fulfill
the
president's
pledge
to
erect
new
barriers
along
the
southern
border
as
of
august
the
administration
has
updated
roughly
miles
of
wall
on
the
us-mexico
border
according
to
customs
and
border
protection
and
the
army
corps
construction
activities
to
mount
new
wall
in
the
rio
grande
valley
sector
is
underway
according
to
the
agencies
