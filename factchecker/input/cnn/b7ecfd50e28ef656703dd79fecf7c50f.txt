castro
here
are
the
facts
how
many
people
would
be
covered
under
biden's
health
care
plan
castro
attacked
biden's
health
care
plan
saying
the
problem
with
your
plan
is
that
it
leaves
million
uncovered
facts
first
castro
is
right
it's
not
the
first
time
a
democratic
contender
has
criticized
biden's
plan
harris
made
an
issue
of
it
on
the
debate
stage
in
detroit
biden's
proposal
which
builds
on
the
affordable
care
act
by
creating
a
government-backed
health
insurance
option
and
increasing
obamacare's
federal
subsidies
would
insure
more
than
an
estimated
of
americans
according
to
his
plan
that
means
out
of
the
population
of
million
in
the
country
roughly
million
would
be
left
without
any
health
insurance
however
it's
unclear
exactly
who
would
be
uninsured
but
under
biden's
plan
families
buying
coverage
on
the
obamacare
exchanges
would
spend
no
more
than
of
their
income
on
health
insurance
a
sum
that
might
be
too
pricey
for
some
americans
donna
borak
castro's
attack
on
biden
over
his
health
care
claims
castro
attacked
former
biden
for
saying
that
people
would
be
automatically
enrolled
in
his
health
care
plan
which
calls
for
creating
a
government-backed
insurance
option
facts
first
castro
who
supports
a
universal
medicare
for
all
program
is
partly
correct
biden's
plan
would
require
most
individuals
to
sign
up
or
buy
in
though
it
would
automatically
cover
low-income
americans
for
free
castro
supports
medicare
for
all
where
all
citizens
would
be
enrolled
in
a
plan
run
by
the
federal
government
biden's
plan
on
the
other
hand
would
only
automatically
enroll
those
who
qualify
for
medicaid
the
government
health
insurance
program
for
the
poor
biden
initially
said
look
everybody
says
we
want
an
option
the
option
i'm
proposing
is
medicare
for
all
medicare
for
choice
if
you
want
medicare
if
you
lose
the
job
from
your
insurance
from
your
employer
you
automatically
can
buy
into
this
you
don't
have
no
pre-existing
condition
can
stop
you
from
buying
in
you
get
covered
period
castro
responded
but
the
difference
between
what
i
support
and
what
you
support
vice
president
biden
is
that
you
require
them
to
opt
in
and
i
would
not
require
them
to
opt
in
they
would
automatically
be
enrolled
they
wouldn't
have
a
buy
in
then
biden
responded
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
they
do
not
have
to
buy
in
castro
replied
you
just
said
that
you
just
said
that
two
minutes
ago
you
just
two
minutes
ago
that
they
would
have
to
buy
in
biden
then
clarified
that
he's
only
talking
about
those
who
can't
afford
to
buy-in
people
who
get
medicaid
biden
do
not
have
to
buy
in
if
you
can't
afford
it
castro
you
said
they
would
have
to
buy
in
biden
your
grandmother
would
not
have
to
buy
in
if
she
qualifies
for
medicaid
she
would
automatically
be
enrolled
castro
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
two
minutes
ago
i
mean
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
you're
forgetting
that

the
future
of
private
health
insurance
klobuchar
went
after
sanders
defense
of
his
medicare
for
all
bill
attempting
to
turn
his
signature
line
of
i
wrote
the
damn
bill
into
a
one-liner
of
her
own
and
while
bernie
wrote
the
bill
i
read
the
bill
and
on
page
on
page
of
the
bill
it
says
that
we
will
no
longer
have
private
insurance
as
we
know
it
and
that
means
that
million
americans
will
no
longer
be
able
to
have
their
current
insurance
facts
first
this
is
true
according
to
one
estimate
by
a
prominent
health
care
research
center
on
page
of
the
legislation
klobuchar
references
s.
the
medicare
for
all
act
of
there
is
a
provision
that
stipulates
it
would
be
unlawful
under
the
plan
for
a
private
health
insurer
to
sell
health
insurance
coverage
that
duplicates
the
benefits
provided
under
this
act
the
bill
also
bans
employer-provided
coverage
on
the
same
page
however
different
organizations
have
different
estimates
for
how
many
americans
have
private
insurance
and
who
therefore
would
be
at
risk
of
losing
it
under
a
medicare
for
all
plan
klobuchar
cites
a
number
backed
by
a
survey
conducted
by
the
kaiser
family
foundation
a
national
nonpartisan
nonprofit
that
survey
indicated
that
million
non-elderly
people
had
employer-sponsored
coverage
while
some
republicans
and
democrats
have
cited
the
higher
figure
the
us
census
bureau
estimated
that
in
more
than
million
people
had
employment-based
health
insurance

and

us
health
care
spending
vs
other
wealthy
countries
sanders
repeated
a
claim
he's
often
made
on
the
amount
of
money
the
us
spends
on
health
care
we
are
spending
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
health
care
as
the
canadians
or
any
other
major
country
on
earth
sanders
said
facts
first
sanders
is
right
about
canada
while
there's
no
universal
definition
of
major
country
so
there's
some
subjectivity
here
it's
not
true
that
the
us
spends
twice
as
much
per
capita
on
health
care
as
every
other
country
in
the
organisation
for
economic
co-operation
and
development
a
group
of
wealthy
countries
around
the
world
at
per
capita
in
the
us
did
spend
more
than
twice
as
much
as
canada
and
more
than
twice
as
much
as
the
oecd
average
in
but
switzerland
norway
and
germany
all
were
substantially
above
half
the
us
level
sweden
austria
and
denmark
were
also
above
half
though
more
slightly
you
can
read
a
longer
version
of
this
fact
check
here
sanders
has
been
repeating
this
same
exaggeration
since
at
least
when
fact-checkers
at
politifact
first
noted
that
it
wasn't
true
daniel
dale
wealth
taxes
warren
argued
that
her
proposed
wealth
tax
would
cover
her
plans
for
universal
pre-k
and
child
care
i
have
proposed
a
two-cent
wealth
tax
on
the
top
one-tenth
of
one
percent
in
this
country
she
said
that
would
give
us
enough
money
to
start
with
our
babies
by
providing
universal
child
care
for
every
baby
age
to
universal
pre-k
for
every
year-old
and
year-old
in
this
country
facts
first
according
to
some
studies
of
warren's
wealth
tax
plan
it
would
certainly
cover
her
universal
pre-k
and
universal
child
care
plan
and
she
has
said
at
other
times
it
would
also
cover
her
plan
for
free
public
college
but
some
experts
estimate
that
the
wealth
tax
would
bring
in
far
less
revenue
than
warren
estimates
warren's
proposed
wealth
levy
would
be
a
tax
on
americans
with
a
net
worth
exceeding
million
with
an
additional
levy
on
billionaires
this
would
affect
some
households
according
to
a
study
from
two
economics
professors
at
the
university
of
berkeley
cited
by
warren's
campaign
even
though
we
can't
know
for
sure
how
much
warren's
wealth
tax
plan
will
raise
these
two
economists
who
reviewed
the
proposal
for
the
warren
campaign
estimate
it
could
bring
in
trillion
over
years
would
this
high
estimate
of
trillion
over
years
cover
warren's
universal
child
care
plan
based
on
some
estimates
yes
easily
mark
zandi
chief
economist
at
moody's
analytics
who
authored
a
study
which
was
commissioned
but
not
paid
for
by
the
warren
campaign
on
warren's
universal
child
care
told
cnn
the
plan
would
cost
billion
over
years
after
accounting
for
the
boost
it
would
provide
the
economy
her
universal
child
care
plan
would
provide
free
child
care
for
families
with
incomes
below
of
the
poverty
level
and
reduce
child
care
costs
by
according
to
an
analysis
of
the
plan
from
cnn
again
warren
has
also
suggested
that
the
wealth
tax
would
cover
free
public
college
on
top
of
the
universal
child
care
program
which
could
cost
some
trillion
over
years
there
are
some
potential
issues
that
such
a
wealth
tax
might
run
into
including
legality
as
cnn's
facts
first
team
has
previously
noted
some
experts
have
calculated
that
warren's
wealth
tax
would
only
bring
in
at
most
of
estimates
warren
has
cited
warren's
plan
would
likely
receive
legal
pushback
as
well
the
th
amendment
states
that
congress
can
lay
and
collect
taxes
on
income
not
wealth
unlike
the
gift
and
estate
tax
warren's
plan
would
be
taxing
the
actual
wealth
a
problem
which
would
likely
reach
the
supreme
court
if
the
tax
went
into
effect

family
separations
at
the
border
in
a
discussion
of
immigration
policy
biden
said
we
didn't
lock
people
up
in
cages
we
didn't
separate
families
facts
first
both
of
biden's
claims
are
false
while
the
obama
administration
didn't
systematically
separate
families
it
did
happen
under
certain
circumstances
separations
did
sometimes
occur
under
obama
but
they
were
non-routine
and
much
less
frequent
according
to
immigration
experts
and
former
obama
officials
they
occurred
in
exceptional
cases
examples
include
those
where
the
parent
was
being
criminally
prosecuted
for
carrying
drugs
across
the
border
or
other
serious
crimes
aside
from
illegal
crossing
those
where
human
trafficking
was
suspected
and
those
where
the
authorities
could
not
confirm
the
connection
between
the
child
and
the
adult
the
separations
didn't
happen
as
a
result
of
a
blanket
policy
however
as
was
the
case
during
the
trump
administration's
controversial
zero
tolerance
policy
last
year
similarly
fenced
enclosures
at
processing
facilities
along
the
border
the
structures
that
have
been
labeled
as
cages
existed
under

administration
some
individuals
including
children
were
held

trump's
tariffs
are
costing
jobs
klobuchar
said
that
trump's
trade
war
is
costing
american
jobs
one
forecast
recently
says
that
it
has
already
cost
us
jobs
she
said
facts
first
this
is
true
according
to
one
major
economic
analysis
a
september
report
from
moody's
analytics
estimates
that
trump's
trade
war
with
china
has
cost
almost
jobs
since
it
started
about
a
year
ago
it's
tricky
to
calculate
exactly
how
many
jobs
have
been
lost
because
of
trump's
tariffs
on
chinese-made
goods
one
reason
the
trade
war
could
be
hurting
american
jobs
is
because
trump's
tariff
strategy
has
created
a
lot
of
uncertainty
for
businesses
they
don't
know
how
long
the
tariffs
will
be
in
place
or
whether
the
rate
of
the
tariff
will
go
up
as
part
of
a
negotiating
strategy
making
it
hard
to
make
investments
and
hire
new
workers
but
the
moody's
report
isn't
the
only
one
that
suggests
the
duties
are
having
an
effect
on
us
workers
a
report
from
staffing
firm

supported
prohibiting

ownership
for
years
after
a

has
been
convicted
of
violating
a
domestic-violence
restraining

numbers
are
much
higher
because
they
realize
what
we've
all
been
saying
is
correct
over
of
the
american
people
think
we
have
to
get
assault
weapons
off
the
street
period
facts
first
support
for
buyback
programs
of
assault
weapons
and
a
ban
on
assault
weapons
are
both
much
lower
than
biden's
claim
recent
polls
show
around
of
americans
support
a
mandatory
buyback
program
of
assault
weapons
that
would
get
them
off
the
street
according
to
polls
published
in
september
by
both
monmouth
university
and
the
washington
post
abc
news
which
showed
and
support
respectively
among
democrats
only
support
for
an
assault
weapons
ban
is
much
higher
the
monmouth
university
poll
found
of
democrats
support
specifically
a
ban
on
future
sales
of
assault
weapons
meanwhile
support
among
all
americans
for
criminal
background
checks
is
at
according
to
a
fox
news
poll
from
august
the
monmouth
poll
also
shows
support
for
background
checks
near
the
range
among
members
of
the
nra
half
of
whom
biden
claimed
supported
his
original
gun
control
proposals
support
for
any
assault
weapon
related
measures
is
low
that
same
monmouth
poll
found
of
nra
members
support
a
ban
on
assault
weapons
sales
and
only
of
nra
members
are
in
favor
of
a
mandatory

buyback
program
tara
subramaniam
harris
record
as
a
prosecutor
harris
pushed
back
on
detractors
of
her
criminal
justice
record
thursday
night
touting
her
work
to
bring
body
cameras
to
california
law
enforcement
among
the
progressive
highlights
of
her
years
as
a
prosecutor
i
created
one
of
the
first-in-the-nation
requirements
that
a
state
law
enforcement
agency
would
have
to
wear
cameras
and
keep
them
on
full-time
the
former
california
attorney
general
said
facts
first
harris
accurately
describes
the
program
she
started
but
it's
not
the
whole
picture
of
her
history
on
body
cameras
harris
required
that
law
enforcement
officials
under
her
at
the
california
department
of
justice
wear
body
cameras
in
a
policy
billed
at
the
time
as
novel
at
the
state
level
but
soon
after
setting
that
rule
she
told
the
sacramento
bee
that
she
was
against
statewide
standards
regulating
the
use
of
body
cameras
for
police
officers
a
position
that
disappointed
some
advocates
locally
according
to
the
los
angeles
times
at
the
time
harris
stopped
short
of
endorsing
statewide
regulations
on
the
use
of
police
body
cameras
saying
that
she
believes
all
officers
should
wear
them
but
that
local
agencies
are
best
equipped
to
enact
policies
david
shortell
support
for
the
war
in
iraq
biden
framed
his
vote
for
the
iraq
war
as
a
vote
to
get
more
weapons
inspectors
into
iraq
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
should
have
never
voted
to
give
bush
authority
to
go
in
and
do
what
he
said
he
was
gonna
to
do
biden
said
the
aumf
was
designed
he
said
to
go
in
and
get
the
security
council
to
vote
to
nothing
to
allow
inspectors
to
go
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
anything
was
being
done
with
chemical
weapons
or
nuclear
weapons
and
when
that
happened
he
went
ahead
and
went
anyway
without
any
of
that
proof
facts
first
biden
is
only
telling
half
the
story
the
aumf
did
call
for
continued
un
enforcement
of
weapons
inspections
but
it
also
authorized
the
president
to
use
military
force
in
iraq
and
biden
was
never
opposed
to
the
possibility
of
military
action
saying
in
that
he
was
not
opposed
to
war
to
remove
weapons
of
mass
destruction
from
iraq
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
against
iraq
resolution
of
which
biden
voted
for
did
call
for
president
bush
to
strictly
enforce
through
the
united
nations
security
council
all
relevant
security
council
resolutions
applicable
to
iraq
and
encourages
him
in
those
efforts
and
obtain
prompt
and
decisive
action
by
the
security
council
to
ensure
that
iraq
abandons
its
strategy
of
delay
evasion
and
noncompliance
and
promptly
and
strictly
complies
with
all
relevant
security
council
resolutions
but
it
also
authorized
the
president
to
use
force
in
iraq
in
to
defend
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
against
the
continuing
threat
posed
by
iraq
and
enforce
all
relevant
united
nations
security
council
resolutions
regarding
iraq
biden
made
clear
at
the
time
his
vote
included
the
possibility
of
military
action
let
everyone
here
be
absolutely
clear
he
said
in
a
speech
to
the
new
castle
county
chamber
of
commerce
in
delaware
in
february
i
supported
the
resolution
to
go
to
war
i
am
not
opposed
to
war
to
remove
weapons
of
mass
destruction
from
iraq
i
am
not
opposed
to
war
to
remove
saddam
from
those
weapons
if
it
comes
to
that
andrew
kaczynski
air
force
layovers
at
trump
hotels
buttigieg
claimed
that
air
force
flights
were
apparently
being
routed
through
scotland
so
that
air
crews
can
stay
at
president
donald
trump's
hotels
we
also
have
a
president
right
now
who
seems
to
treat
troops
as
props
buttigieg
said
or
worse
tools
for
his
own
enrichment
we
saw
what's
going
on
with
flights
apparently
being
routed
through
scotland
just
so
people
can
stay
at
his
hotels
facts
first
there
is
no
current
evidence
that
any
military
flight
was
routed
through
scotland
for
the
express
purpose
of
having
personnel
stay
at
a
trump
property
the
air
force
however
is
conducting
an
investigation
into
how
it
chooses
airports
and
hotels
during
international
trips
so
it's
possible
more
information
may
emerge
while
the
air
force
has
increasingly
used
scotland's
prestwick
airport
for
refueling
in
recent
years
the
service
says
it
is
because
of
favorable
weather
conditions
in
the
area
and
the
fact
that
there
is
less
aircraft
congestion
there
a
decision
by
the
pentagon
to
increase
its
use
of
the
airport
to
refuel
air
force
flights
in
had
local
airport
officials
sending
flight
crews
to
hotels
in
the
area
for
overnight
stays
including
trump's
turnberry
resort
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
president's
company
the
trump
organization
did
enter
into
a
partnership
with
the
scottish
airport
in
that
routinely
sent
flight
crews
to
his
turnberry
resort
the
times
reported
but
there
is
no
discernable
connection
between
that
deal
and
the
pentagon's
decision
to
send
more
aircraft
there
trump
wasn't
even
president
until
overnight
stays
by
air
force
personnel
at
trump
turnberry
the
hotel
and
golf
course
in
scotland
have
come
under
scrutiny
from
house
democrats
in
recent
weeks
the
controversy
stems
in
part
from
the
fact
that
there
are
hotel
options
even
closer
to
prestwick
airport
but
some
air
force
crews
have
still
opted
to
stay
at
the
president's
resort
president
trump
has
continually
faced
questions
about
conflicts
of
interest
because
unlike
his
predecessors
he
has
not
divested
from
his
businesses
an
internal
us
air
force
review
of
overnight
stays
by
air
crews
during
refueling
stops
at
prestwick
airport
found
that
military
personnel
stayed
at
turnberry
approximately
of
the
time
between
and
zachary
cohen
and
sarah
westwood
