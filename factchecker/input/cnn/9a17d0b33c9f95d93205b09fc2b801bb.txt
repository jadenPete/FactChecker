the
very
dark
truth
about
donald
trump
revealed
in
his
cokie
roberts
comments
cnn
usually
when
someone
dies
you
follow
the
rule
your
mom
taught
you
if
you
don't
have
anything
nice
to
say
don't
say
anything
at
all
president
donald
trump
doesn't
follow
that
rule
asked
about
the
passing
of
legendary
journalist
cokie
roberts
on
tuesday
here's
what
trump
said
in
part
i
never
met
her
she
never
treated
me
nicely
but
i
would
like
to
wish
her
family
well
she
was
a
professional
and
i
respect
professionals
so
yeah
the
first
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
asked
about
someone's
death
was
a
never
met
her
and
b
she
never
treated
me
nicely
me
me
me
me
me
me
while
all
politicians
and
all
people
tend
to
see
things
through
a
how-does-this-impact-me
lens
most
of
us
understand
that
turning
everything
especially
someone
else's
death
into
a
conversation
about
ourselves
is
hugely
selfish
and
narcissistic
it
also
reeks
of
a
lack
of
empathy
an
inability
to
step
outside
yourself
and
into
another
person's
shoes
for
even
a
minute
that
trump's
first
instinct
when
asked
about
the
death
of
a
prominent
journalist
would
be
to
make
it
about
himself
and
then
use
it
as
a
piece
of
ammo
in
his
long-running
fight
with
the
news
media
is
even
for
this
president
a
remarkable
thing
and
by
remarkable
i
mean
revealing
revealing
in
that
it
makes
clear
and
if
you
have
been
paying
attention
to
the
presidency
it
might
well
already
be
crystal
clear
to
you
that
trump
is
simply
unconcerned
about
anyone
who
isn't
him
he
doesn't
view
the
presidency
as
a
position
of
moral
leadership
he
just
does
and
says
what
he
wants
when
he
wants
that
rejection
of
moral
leadership
of
taking
the
high
road
of
understanding
that
you
don't
need
to
say
everything
you
think
is
what
makes
trump
truly
radical
vis
a
vis
the
other
men
who
have
held
the
office
of
president
they
tried
and
sometimes
failed
but
always
tried
to
do
what
they
believed
to
be
the
right
thing
even
if
it
wasn't
what
they
wanted
to
do
trump
makes
no
attempt
to
do
so
none
you
can
argue
that
what
trump
says
about
a
deceased
journalist
isn't
that
big
a
deal
especially
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
things
he
has
said
and
done
as
president
i
get
that
but
it
reveals
something
far
deeper
and
darker
about
trump
someone
who
is
incapable
of
expressing
empathy
or
even
of
not
saying
something
bad
about
a
dead
person
is
someone
who
is
so
self-focused
as
to
be
largely
if
not
totally
blind
to
the
world
around
him
that's
a
problem
for
any
person
it's
a
massive
problem
and
should
be
a
huge
area
of
concern
when
the
person
we
are
talking
about
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
none
of
this
of
course
means
that
trump
can't
or
won't
win
in
after
all
he
won
in
even
while
badly
losing
voters
who
said
a
candidate
who
cares
about
me
was
their
biggest
priority
voting
for
trump
in
was
about
choosing
a
radical
change
agent
and
it's
indisputable
that
he's
been
that
but
the
assumption
that
all
change
is
good
change
is
a
mistaken
one
whether
trump
wins
or
loses
next
november
his
lack
of
empathy
and
presidency
devoid
of
moral
leadership
will
have
fundamentally
altered
the
way
in
which
the
presidency
is
conceived
in
at
least
some
circles
in
the
country
and
not
in
a
good
way
