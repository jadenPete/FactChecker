jumped
into
the
controversy
over
the
racist
comments
by
a
new
saturday
night
live
hire
calling
them
cheap
shots
yang
a
taiwanese-american
candidate
tweeted
directly
to
comedian
shane
gillis
writing
shane
i
prefer
comedy
that
makes
people
think
and
doesn't
take
cheap
shots
but
i'm
happy
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
you
if
you'd
like
yang's
tweet
lent
the
highest
voice
yet
on
the
debate
and
anger
raging
on
social
media
this
weekend
focusing
attention
on
yang's
identity
as
a
man
of
east
asian
descent
running
for
the
highest
office
in
american
politics
the
tweet
prompted
a
response
from
sen
elizabeth
warren's
campaign
manager
roger
lau
the
first
asian
american
in
the
role
for
a
major
presidential
candidate
thank
you
for
your
leadership
sir
tweeted
lau
this
is
absolutely
f'ed
but
i
agree
that
this
can
and
should
be
a
teaching
moment
we
can
and
should
be
better
than
this
the
snl
controversy
started
just
hours
after
nbc
announced
thursday
the
hiring
of
gillis
as
one
of
three
new
cast
members
one
of
those
three
new

was

the

full-time
cast
member
of
east
asian
descent
the
celebratory
mood
on
social
media
among
asian
americans
over
bowen
yang's
hiring
quickly
soured
when
freelance
writer
seth
simons
tweeted
a
two-minute

clip
of
gillis

shane's

gillis
responded
on
twitter
to
the
criticism
posting
a
statement
i'm
a
comedian
who
pushes
boundaries
i
sometimes
miss
reads
the
statement
if
you
go
through
my
years
of
comedy
most
of
it
bad
you're
going
to
find
a
lot
of
bad
misses
i'm
happy
to
apologize
to
anyone
who's
actually
been
offended
by
anything
i've
said
my
intention
is
never
to
hurt
anyone
but
i
am
trying
to
be
the
best
comedian
i
can
be
and
sometimes
that
requires
risks
in
a
may
interview
with
philadelphia's
billy
penn
gillis
talked
about
the
boundaries
he
pushes
with
his
brand
of
comedy
you
throw
stuff
out
there
and
you
get
to
see
them
react
to
things
like
yea
or
nay
what's
funny
and
what's
not
gillis
is
quoted
as
saying
you
can
be
racist
to
asians
that's
what
we're
finding
out
gillis
told
billy
penn
political
commentator
kurt
bardella
an
asian
american
tweeted
his
disgust
at
the
snl
member's
video
clip
saying
the
word
ch-nk
is
to
people
who
look
like
me
using
that
slur
is
the
equivalent
of
calling
a
person
of
color
the
n
word
i
think
racism
against
asian
americans
is
one
of
the
more
under-reported
or
under-estimated
components
of
racism
in
america
in
bardella
told
cnn
to
those
of
us
in
the
asian
american
community
who
have
been
the
targets
of
racism
there
is
nothing
funny
about
it
about
an
hour
after
offering
to
meet
with
gillis
yang
followed
up
with
a
second
tweet
saying
he
didn't
think
gillis
should
lose
his
just-announced
job
we
would
benefit
from
being
more
forgiving
rather
than
punitive
yang
tweeted
bardella
adds
in
response
that
as
someone
not
burdened
with
all
that
comes
from
running
for
president
my
tolerance
for
such
blatant
racism
is
not
on
par
with
yang's
i
think
he
should
lose
his
job
as
it
is
clear
from
his
statement
that
he
simply
does
not
fully
understand
how
egregious
his
brand
of
comedy
is
to
the
asian
american
community
if
this
were
a
white
comedian
caught
on
tape
using
the
n
word
we
wouldn't
even
be
entertaining
the
conversation
of
whether
or
not
he
should
keep
his
job
yang
himself
is
a
complicated
figure
to
highlight
the
racist
comments
at
thursday's
democratic
debate
yang
cracked
an
off-color
joke
as
he
discussed
healthcare
and
the
mounting
paperwork
doctors
face
i'm
asian
so
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
quipped
yang
the
joke
landed
like
a
thud
with
some
on
social
media
with
asian
american
commentators
accusing
yang
of
leaning
on
the
model
minority
asian
stereotype
it's
an
accusation
that's
not
new
to
yang
who
has
leaned
into
the
model
minority
asian
stereotype
at
a
campaign
stop
in
seattle
he
called
his
campaign
the
nerdiest
presidential
campaign
in
history
merchandise
on
yang's
website
include
a
hat
with
math
on
it
and
notebooks
with
a
picture
of
yang
as
an
awkward
teenager
but
those
both
in
and
outside
of
politics
noted
yang's
wading
into
the
pop
culture
fray
with
gillis
phil
yu
the
blogger
behind
angry
asian
man
told
cnn
that
yang
like
most
asian
americans
has
certainly
been
the
target
of
the
racial
epitaph
gillis
used
that
yang
waded
in
believes
yu
speaks
to
the
importance
of
representation
for
the
fastest
growing
racial
group
in
america
people
are
listening
to
what
he
has
to
say
says
yu
he's
using
his
platform
for
what
it
is
it's
not
insignificant
and
i'd
add
this-
it's
not
just
asian
americans
who
are
paying
attention
it
amplifies
the
issue
more
for
yu
the
ultimate
judgment
of
whether
yang's
tweets
mean
anything
outside
of
the
asian
american
community
will
be
what
happens
to
gillis
on
snl
are
we
headed
into
an
era
that
just
like
our
president
where
anyone
can
say
anything
racist
about
anyone
are
we
really
in
a
place
where
racism
is
just
a
difference
of
opinion
if
there's
no
response
at
all
from
nbc
i
think's
that
pretty
weak
says
yu
