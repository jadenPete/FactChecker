the
supreme
court's
order
wednesday
allowing
new
asylum
restrictions
to
go
into
effect
marks
a
significant
win
for
president
donald
trump
who's
faced
several
legal
challenges
in
his
attempt
to
implement
a
hard-line
immigration
agenda
and
could
embolden
him
on
other
related
issues
such
as
the
upcoming
refugee
ceiling
the
administration
has
rolled
out
policies
aiming
to
curb
the
flow
of
migrants
coming
to
the
us-mexico
border
following
a
steep
uptick
in
border
arrests
in
recent
months
wednesday's
decision
allows
the
administration
to
move
forward
with
a
rule
that
limits
asylum
for
some
and
in
effect
send
thousands
of
central
american
migrants
back
to
mexico
to
apply
for
asylum
less
than
hours
after
the
supreme
court's
order
acting
us
citizenship
and
immigration
services
director
ken
cuccinelli
reflected
on
the
slew
of
lawsuits
that
have
challenged
the
administration's
policies
during
an
interview
with
axios
mike
allen
thursday
morning
saying
that
it's
sort
of
a
joke
in
the
office
when
a
policy
will
get
sued
following
its
rollout
when
pressed
by
allen
on
why
the
administration
pushes
forward
policies
it
knows
it'll
get
sued
for
cuccinelli
quipped
because
we're
right
one
we're
implementing
the
president's
policies
he's
made
it
very
clear
from
day
one
frankly
before
day
one
when
he
was
campaigning
that
he
intended
to
be
forceful
and
aggressive
in
this
space
from
a
policy
standpoint
cuccinelli
said
supreme
court
clears
the
way
for
new
asylum
restrictions
to
take
effect
over
the
course
of
the
year
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
moved
to
expand
the
so-called
remain
in
mexico
policy
that
requires
some
asylum
seekers
to
wait
in
mexico
for
the
duration
of
their
immigration
proceedings
that
program
is
also
being
challenged
in
court
but
has
been
allowed
to
remain
in
effect
for
now
the
supreme
court's
order
wednesday
was
related
to
a
rule
from
the
departments
of
justice
and
homeland
security
prohibiting
migrants
who
have
resided
in
or
traveled
through
third
countries
from
seeking
asylum
in
the
us
therefore
barring
people
traveling
through
mexico
from
being
able
to
claim
asylum
taken
together
the
administration
is
in
a
position
to
limit
a
wide
swath
of
migrants
from
claiming
asylum
in
the
united
states
given
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
apprehensions
are
of
migrants
from
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
so
far
this
fiscal
year
the
border
patrol
has
arrested
families
from
those
countries
according
to
customs
and
border
protection
data
only
families
were
from
mexico
immigrant
advocacy
groups
have
warned
that
sending
central
american
migrants
back
to
mexico
puts
them
in
harm's
way
but
the
administration
has
countered
that
the
number
of
arrivals
has
strained
the
system
cuccinelli
suggested
in
an
interview
with
cnn
thursday
that
the
supreme
court's
order
will
allow
his
agency
uscis
to
attend
to
other
humanitarian
matters
like
the
processing
of
refugees
all
the
same
people
have
to
do
that
work
cuccinelli
said
referring
to
officers
that
work
on
asylum
and
refugee
cases
these
things
do
affect
one
another
i
haven't
even
been
back
to
the
office
yet
since
the
supreme
court
ruling
so
how
that
may
affect
our
analysis
is
yet
undetermined
but
i
can
tell
you
we're
not
at
a
final
point
but
i
don't
know
how
close
we
are
that's
done
at
a
level
above
my
pay
grade
cuccinelli
cited
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo's
remarks
last
year
in
announcing
the
fiscal
year
refugee
cap
of
as
an
example
of
the
administration
taking
a
comprehensive
approach
at
the
time
pompeo
said
the
number
the
lowest
level
since
should
not
be
considered
as
the
sole
barometer
of
the
united
states
commitment
to
humanitarian
efforts
around
the
world
adding
that
the
us
would
focus
on
the
humanitarian
protection
cases
of
those
already
in
the
country
i
fully
expect
us
to
look
at
this
on
a
comprehensive
basis
again
this
year
cuccinelli
said
thursday
earlier
this
week
former
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
headed
a
high-level
meeting
on
the
topic
of
refugees
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
the
meeting
known
as
a
principals
committee
meeting
ended
only
an
hour
before
the
president's
tweet
announcing
bolton's
resignation
it's
unclear
what
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
was
for
now
at
least
the
administration
appears
on
track
to
follow
through
on
its
agenda
as
it
relates
to
asylum
leaving
thousands
of
migrants
at
the
southern
border
to
seek
refuge
elsewhere
for
the
time
being
