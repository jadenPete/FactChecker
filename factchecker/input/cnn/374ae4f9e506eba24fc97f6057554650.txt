secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
pinned
the
blame
on
iran
for
an
attack
at
a
saudi
oil
field
in
a
pair
of
tweets
saturday
drone
strikes
on
crucial
saudi
arabian
oil
facilities
have
disrupted
about
half
of
the
kingdom's
oil
capacity
or
of
the
daily
global
oil
supply
cnn
business
reported
earlier
saturday
yemen's
houthi
rebels
took
responsibility
for
the
attacks
but
they
are
often
backed
by
iran
but
preliminary
indications
are
that
the
attacks
did
not
originate
from
yemen
and
likely
originated
from
iraq
according
to
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
incident
the
same
official
said
the
damage
was
caused
by
an
armed
drone
attack
cnn
national
security
analyst
peter
bergen
said
there
have
been
more
than
drone
and
missile
attacks
launched
by
houthi
rebels
from
yemen
into
saudi
arabia
and
none
have
been
as
effective
as
saturday's
attack
lending
credence
to
the
belief
that
the
attack
did
not
originate
from
yemen
tehran
is
behind
nearly
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
while
rouhani
and
zarif
pretend
to
engage
in
diplomacy
pompeo
tweeted
referencing
iran's
president
hassan
rouhani
and
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
amid
all
the
calls
for
de-escalation
iran
has
now
launched
an
unprecedented
attack
on
the
world's
energy
supply
there
is
no
evidence
the
attacks
came
from
yemen
pompeo
continued
providing
no
evidence
that
iran
was
behind
the
attacks
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
seyyed
abbas
mousavi
rejected
the
accusation
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
such
blind
accusations
and
inappropriate
comments
in
a
diplomatic
context
are
incomprehensible
and
meaningless
he
said
adding
even
hostility
needs
a
certain
degree
of
credibility
and
reasonable
frameworks
us
officials
have
also
violated
these
basic
principles
saudi
arabia
has
been
leading
a
military
campaign
to
quash
the
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
since
march
the
conflict
is
widely
seen
as
a
proxy
war
between
the
saudis
and
iran
which
has
been
backing
the
houthis
pompeo
also
called
for
other
countries
to
denounce
iran
and
promised
american
efforts
to
help
support
the
energy
market
we
call
on
all
nations
to
publicly
and
unequivocally
condemn
iran's
attacks
he
tweeted
the
united
states
will
work
with
our
partners
and
allies
to
ensure
that
energy
markets
remain
well
supplied
and
iran
is
held
accountable
for
its
aggression
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
officials
are
investigating
the
possibility
that
the
attacks
involved
cruise
missiles
cnn
has
independently
reached
out
to
the
state
department
for
further
information
regarding
the
attack
and
who
was
involved
lawmakers
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
weighed
in
on
pompeo's
characterizations
of
the
attack
this
is
such
irresponsible
simplification
and
it's
how
we
get
into
dumb
wars
of
choice
democratic
sen
chris
murphy
of
connecticut
tweeted
in
response
to
pompeo
the
saudis
and
houthis
are
at
war
he
added
the
saudis
attack
the
houthis
and
the
houthis
attack
back
iran
is
backing
the
houthis
and
has
been
a
bad
actor
but
it's
just
not
as
simple
as
houthis
iran
meanwhile
republican
sen
tom
cotton
of
arkansas
vowed
that
the
united
states
stands
with
our
saudi
partners
in
confronting
iran's
campaign
of
terror
across
the
middle
east
the
ayatollahs
desperate
efforts
to
cripple
global
energy
markets
will
only
renew
our
commitment
to
maximum
pressure
he
added
in
a
statement
the
iranian
regime
and
its
proxies
ought
to
face
consequences
for
these
attacks
president
donald
trump
called
saudi
crown
prince
mohammad
bin
salman
on
saturday
to
offer
his
support
for

said
in

statement
the

deere
said
violent
actions
against

vital

deepen
