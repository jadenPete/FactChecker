democratic
presidential
candidates
beto
o'rourke
and
pete
buttigieg
clashed
sunday
over
o'rourke's
direct
comment
about

proposed

gun-buyback

assault-style
rifles

o'rourke
said
in
a
standout
moment
at
the
abc
news
democratic
presidential
debate
thursday
his
comment
frustrated
some
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
who
are
trying
to
find
a
way
forward
on
gun
legislation
that
republicans
and
democrats
can
agree
on
buttigieg
said
sunday
he
agrees
with
those
who
say
o'rourke's
comment
plays
into
the
hands
of
republicans
the
south
bend
indiana
mayor
argued
now
is
a
golden
moment
to
pass
gun
legislation
telling
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
state
of
the
union
that
the
majority
of
americans
support
so-called
red
flag
laws
banning
high-capacity
magazines
and
prohibiting
the
sale
of
assault
weapons
when
even
this
president
and
even
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
we
know
that
we
have
a
moment
on
our
hands
buttigieg
said
let's
make
the
most
of
it
and
get
these
things
done
o'rourke
fired
back
at
buttigieg
on
twitter
and
wrote
leaving
millions
of
weapons
of
war
on
the
streets
because
trump
and
mcconnell
are
at
least
pretending
to
be
open
to
reforms
that
calculation
and
fear
is
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
he
continued
let's
have
the
courage
to
say
what
we
believe
and
fight
for
it
beto
o'rourke
just
did
republicans
a
massive
favor
on
guns
o'rourke
is
one
of
three
democrats
along
with
sens
kamala
harris
of
california
and
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
to
support
mandatory
buybacks
for
certain
guns
other
democrats
including
buttigieg
would
make
them
illegal
but
not
require
them
to
be
bought
back
by
the
government
the
former
texas
congressman
received
praise
from
fellow
democratic
contenders
during
thursday's
debate
for
his
actions
following
the
mass
shooting
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
where
people
were
gunned
down
at
a
walmart
in
august
his
campaign
heightened
its
focus
on
firearms
in
america
in
the
wake
of
the
shooting
but
his
blunt
hell
yes
comment
had
some
lawmakers
like
delaware
democrat
and
sen
chris
coons
arguing
o'rourke's
comment
feeds
into
a
long-propagated
conservative
talking
point
that
making
any
changes
on
gun
laws
however
minor
could
lead
to
democrats
eventually
forcing
people
to
give
up
their
guns
o'rourke
says
some
conservatives
are
open
to
his
mandatory
gun
buyback
plan
i
frankly
think
that
that
clip
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
coons
told
cnn
friday
morning
o'rourke
defended
his
comment
in
an
interview
with
cnn
friday
insisting
it
would
not
hurt
the
democratic
party
it's
not
a
concern
of
mine
and
that's
in
part
informed
by
listening
to
people
in
conservative
parts
of
america
o'rourke
said
and
folks
are
saying
look
i
would
give
up
that
ar-
or
that
ak-
i
don't
need
it
to
hunt
don't
need
it
to
defend
myself
in
my
home
they
recognize
this
is
a
weapon
designed
for
war
to
kill
people
as
effectively
as
efficiently
and
in
a
great
a
number
as
possible
