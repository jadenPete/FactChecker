democrats
trying
to
have
their
impeachment
and
deny
it
too
cnn
house
democrats
who
won
republican
districts
in
are
pushing
back
on
the
house
judiciary
committee's
impeachment
investigation
effort
arguing
that
pursuing
impeachment
is
a
mistake
and
that
they
would
vote
against
it
the
resistance
from
democrats
in
republican-leaning
districts
comes
as
impeachment
advocates
hailed
thursday's
judiciary
committee's
vote
to
formalize
the
rules
of
its
investigation
and
it
helps
explain
why
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
has
avoided
labeling
the
committee's
probe
as
an
impeachment
inquiry
the
truth
is
impeachment
will
only
tear
our
country
further
apart
and
we
will
see
no
progress
on
the
enormous
challenges
we
face
as
a
nation
rep
max
rose
a
new
york
democrat
wrote
friday
in
an
op-ed
in
the
staten
island
advance
impeachment
will
not
fix
our
roads
and
bridges
or
lower
the
costs
of
drugs
impeachment
will
not
keep
our
kids
safe
from
gun
violence
or
end
the
opioid
epidemic
the
question
of
impeachment
has
swirled
around
house
democrats
since
they
returned
to
washington
this
week
from
a
six-week
recess
with
the
committee's
vote
prompting
confusion
and
frustration
over
the
question
of
whether
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
also
a
democrat
from
new
york
and
other
committee
members
said
the
panel
was
doing
just
that
but
pelosi
and
other
democratic
leaders
resisted
labeling
the
investigation
as
more
than
the
oversight
that
democrats
have
been
conducting
since
they
took
control
of
the
house
in
january
the
rhetorical
divisions
represented
the
larger
split
among
democrats
on
whether
it
is
wise
to
pursue
impeachment
ahead
of
the
election
while
liberal
democrats
are
pushing
for
impeachment
proceedings
frontline
democrats
remain
rose
are
opposed
to
such
efforts
there
are
house
democrats
who
have
publicly
supported
an
impeachment
inquiry
according
to
cnn's
tally
a
cnn
analysis
shows
those
democrats
represent
districts
won
by
hillary
clinton
by
an
average
of
points
while
the
districts
of
those
who
have
not
come
out
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
shrinks
to
a
margin
of
just
points
freshmen
democrats
on
both
sides
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
question
heard
a
range
of
opinions
about
the
issue
from
their
constituents
while
they
were
back
in
their
districts
during
the
august
recess
judiciary
committee
democrats
say
they
are
not
yet
going
forward
with
impeachment
and
the
steps
they
are
taking
in
the
investigation
are
necessary
to
ultimately
decide
whether
to
introduce
articles
against
the
president
but
the
push
in
the
judiciary
committee
this
week
has
also
sparked
a
more
public
voice
of
caution
from
those
democrats
opposed
to
impeachment
rep
anthony
brindisi
a
new
york
democrat
who
like
rose
won
a
republican-held
seat
in
predicted
the
house
did
not
have
the
votes
for
it
yet
democrats
are
already
botching
the
impeachment
fight
i
don't
think
that
if
you
are
going
to
put
articles
of
impeachment
on
the
floor
today
you
can
get
to
votes
and
i
think
that
the
american
people
aren't
there
on
the
issue
of
impeachment
brindisi
said
what
they
are
there
on
is
lowering
drug
costs
fixing
our
healthcare
system
rebuilding
our
nation's
infrastructure
these
are
the
issues
we
should
be
focusing
on
i
would
vote
no
on
impeachment
unless
there's
compelling
evidence
that
comes
out
over
the
next
couple
months
my
vote
is
no
brindisi
added
rep
mikie
sherrill
a
freshman
new
jersey
democrat
also
said
she
didn't
think
the
house
should
be
moving
on
impeachment
i
have
been
supporting
the
committee's
jurisdiction
performing
their
oversight
duties
as
i've
said
i
don't
think
we've
made
the
case
to
the
american
people
that
we
need
to
yet
sherrill
said
this
question
caused
pelosi
to
end
press
conference
pelosi
has
supported
the
judiciary
committee's
efforts
including
court
filings
that
state
they
are
investigating
in
order
to
decide
impeachment
but
she
has
remained
opposed
to
impeachment
arguing
the
public
is
not
yet
there
at
her
weekly
news
conference
thursday
pelosi
bristled
at
reporters
questions
about
whether
the
committee
was
conducting
an
impeachment
inquiry
arguing
the
public
wants
the
house
to
proceed
carefully
they
understand
that
impeachment
is
a
very
divisive
measure
but
if
we
have
to
go
there
we'll
have
to
go
there
pelosi
said
but
we
can't
go
there
unless
we
have
the
facts
and
we
will
follow
the
facts
and
we
will
follow
the
obstruction
that
the
president
is
making
getting
the
facts
and
make
our
decision
when
we're
ready
