cnn
president
donald
trump
is
warring
with
california's
democratic
officials
over
auto-emission
standards
and
the
state's
homeless
crisis
but
here
at
the
center
of
the
resistance
to
his
administration
he's
scooped
up
million
for
his
re-election
campaign
during
a
two-day
swing
through
the
golden
state
the
big
haul
divided
between
trump's
campaign
and
the
republican
national
committee
underscores
the
enormous
financial
advantage
the
president
has
built
over
the
democratic
field
it
also
highlights
the
ability
of
the
white
house
incumbent
to
find
support
in
pockets
of
the
nation's
most
populous
state
even
as
he
spars
with
its
elected
officials
and
celebrity
residents
he's
president
and
he's
very
popular
with
republicans
california's
national
republican
committeewoman
harmeet
dhillon
told
cnn
a
day
after
she
accompanied
trump
to
a
bay
area
fundraiser
at
the
home
of
sun
microsystems
co-founder
scott
mcnealy
officials
say
the
event
brought
in
million
for
trump
victory
the
president's
joint
fundraising
operation
with
the
national
party
dhillon
said
people
attended
the
luncheon
and
she
had
to
turn
away
dozens
more
who
were
eager
to
see
trump
the
president
has
millions
of
supporters
in
california
she
said
there
was
not
a
single
empty
seat
there
california
cash
despite
clashes
trump's
california
trip
marked
by
pair
of
clashes
while
that
might
be
true
the
golden
state
is
also
among
the
most
hostile
to
the
president's
agenda
at
the
grassroots
level
his
policies
have
brought
hundreds
of
thousands
of
californians
out
on
to
the
streets
to
protest
at
the
series
of
women
marches
outrage
over
trump's
rollback
of
environmental
regulations
and
his
administration's
deportation
policies
and
vilification
of
undocumented
immigrants
among
other
policy
disagreements
has
led
the
state
to
file
lawsuits
against
the
federal
government
since
trump
took
office
the
antagonism
toward
trump
in
california
clearly
has
not
dampened
enthusiasm
for
his
reelection
campaign
among
republican
donors
which
was
underscored
by
his
jaw-dropping
million
haul
over
two
days
the
biggest
windfall
of
trump's
california
swing
the
million
raised
tuesday
night
at
the
gated
beverly
hills
home
of
real-estate
developer
geoff
palmer
who
has
supported
the
president
in
the
past
and
recently
hosted
vice
president
mike
pence
for
a
fundraiser
more
than
people
attended
and
trump
spoke
for
minutes
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
told
reporters
on
wednesday
trump
was
expected
to
collect
another
million
at
two
events
million
at
a
breakfast
at
the
intercontinental
hotel
in
downtown
los
angeles
and
million
at
a
luncheon
in
san

trump's
son-in-law
jared
kushner
who
has
been
informally
involved
in
the
re-election
effort
tagged
along
for
his
west
coast
visit
the
president
who
filed
his
reelection
paperwork
the
day
he
was
sworn
into
office
is
raising
money
at
a
pace
unprecedented
for
a
modern
president
and
his
two-day
haul
surpasses
the
nearly
million
that
california's
home-state
sen
kamala
harris
raised
during
the
entire
april-to-june
fundraising
quarter
in
her
bid
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
overall
trump's
campaign
committee
and
the
outside
groups
supporting
him
have
raised
more
than
million
for
his
reelection
through
the
end
of
june
according
to
a
tally
by
the
nonpartisan
center
for
responsive
politics
nearly
matching
the
million
raised
by
the
entire
field
of
democrats
jockeying
to
face
him
in
even
so
the
california
swing
is
not
a
record
haul
for
trump
in
the
two
days
after
he
formally
kicked
off
his
reelection
bid
with
an
orlando
rally
in
june
trump
and
the
republican
national
committee
reported
raising
a
combined
million
under
wraps
uproar
over
trump
donations
sparks
fresh
debate
about
disclosure
advance
details
of
the
president's
fundraising
activities
were
kept
under
tight
wraps
in
the
days
leading
up
to
his
visit
after
billionaire
real-estate
developer
stephen
ross
faced
serious
backlash
for
hosting
a
fundraiser
for
the
president
last
month
in
the
hamptons
an
official
familiar
with
how
the
fundraisers
are
planned
said
there
has
been
an
active
effort
underway
in
recent
weeks
to
keep
the
names
of
those
hosting
the
fundraisers
out
of
the
press
few
dozen
protesters
gathered
along
the
route
of
the
bay
area
fundraiser
dhillon
also
cited
violent
demonstrations
that
broke
out
during
trump's
visit
to
california
as
a
candidate
as
a
reason
for
the
secrecy
surrounding
his
events
this
week
trump's
visit
stirred
controversy
even
before
he
arrived
the
actress
debra
messing
publicly
demanded
a
list
of
who
would
attend
trump's
fundraiser
in
beverly
hills
trump
slammed
messing
in
response
calling
the
will
grace
star
a
bad
actress
who
was
seeking
to
blacklist
his
supporters
dhillon
said
the
bay
area
event
could
have
attracted
three
times
the
number
of
donors
who
crowded
into
mcnealy's
portola
valley
mansion
on
tuesday
to
hear
the
president
trump
and
his
team
left
a
lot
of
money
on
the
table
during
their
short
visit
i
asked
them
will
you
come
back
dhillon
added
they
said
absolutely
california's
gop
once
a
gop
hotbed
orange
county
now
has
more
registered
democrats
than
republicans
for
decades
now
republicans
in
california
have
been
receding
into
the
political
wilderness
but
trump
appears
to
be
accelerating
that
decline
there
is
no
republican
official
elected
statewide
in
california
and
the
gop's
last
grip
on
power
was
the
number
of
seats
they
held
in
congress
but
that
grip
was
weakened
in
the
midterm
elections
trump's
policies
brought
out
outraged
democratic
voters
particularly
women
in
droves
and
they
succeeded
in
flipping
more
than
a
half-dozen
seats
from
red
to
blue
the
number
of
registered
independents
in
california
has
also
been
rising
democrats
who
make
up
of
the
electorate
vastly
outnumber
republicans
here
according
to
data
from
the
public
policy
institute
of
california
the
institute
has
found
that
more
californians
favor
trump's
impeachment
than
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
of
voters
said
they
would
choose
a
candidate
other
than
the
president
in
the
election
next
year
still
trump
whose
approval
rating
has
hovered
around
nationally
enjoys
strong
support
from
republicans
here
of
gop
voters
approve
of
the
job
that
trump
has
done
as
president
while
of
independents
and
of
democrats
approve
according
to
the
latest
ppic
survey
california
gov
gavin
newsom
has
relished
the
fight
against
trump's
agenda
stating
that
california
is
the
progressive
answer
to
a
transgressive
president
the
two
tangled
this
week
over
the
trump
administration's
decision
to
revoke
california's
waiver
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
allowed
the
state
to
set
more
stringent
vehicle
emissions
standards
than
those
set
at
the
federal
level
california
had
been
so
successful
in
negotiating
with
auto
makers
in
their
efforts
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
address
air
quality
issues
that
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
follow
at
least
some
portion
of
their
advanced
clean
car
program
one
thing
i
won't
do
is
capitulate
newsom
told
cnn's
kyung
lah
in
an
interview
about
his
contentious
relationship
with
the
commander-in-chief
before
trump
formally
announced
that
his
administration
would
revoke
the
vehicle
emissions
waiver
look
stay
out
of
our
way
let
california
continue
not
to
survive
but
thrive
despite
the
headwinds
despite
everything
you're
doing
to
try
to
put
sand
in
the
gears
of
our
success
trump
ended
his
trip
with
a
final
shot
at
california
as
he
flew
back
to
washington
aboard
air
force
one
announcing
his
intention
to
give
san
francisco
a
notice
of
environmental
violations
due
to
its
homelessness
problem
it's
a
terrible
situation
that's
in
los
angeles
and
in
san
francisco
he
said
to
reporters
according
to
a
report
from
a
pool
reporter
and
we're
going
to
be
giving
san
francisco
they're
in
total
violation
we're
going
to
be
giving
them
a
notice
very
soon
epa
is
going
to
be
putting
out
a
notice
he
added
they're
in
serious
violation
