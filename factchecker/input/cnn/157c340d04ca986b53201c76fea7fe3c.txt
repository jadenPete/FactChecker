trump's
nafta
replacement
isn't
enough
for
striking
auto
workers
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
has
hardly
weighed
in
on
the
strike
at
general
motors
instead
offering
his
own
us-mexico-canada
agreement
as
a
remedy
for
what's
ailing
the
auto
industry
but
the
prospect
of
the
much-touted
deal
doesn't
seem
to
have
convinced
workers
that
their
jobs
won't
move
to
mexico
nearly
workers
were
off
the
job
for
a
second
day
tuesday
as
the
united
auto
workers
union
continued
to
negotiate
over
wages
and
health
benefits
one
sticking
point
is
bringing
back
manufacturing
jobs
that
have
moved
to
mexico
a
uaw
source
close
to
the
negotiations
told
cnn
that
the
automaker
would
not
budge
on
this
point
a
gm
spokesperson
said
the
company
has
offered
to
create
more
than
jobs
and
invest
billion
in
the
united
states
the
usmca
still
needs
to
be
approved
by
congress
but
some
of
the
major
changes
it
would
make
are
meant
to
address
jobs
moving
to
other
countries
i
have
a
respectful
message
for
all
of
the
united
auto
workers
who
are
currently
on
strike
vice
president
mike
pence
said
tuesday
during
a
speech
at
the
heritage
foundation
as
the
president
said
we
hope
and
trust
you'll
work
out
your
differences
with
gm
but
while
you're
at
it
if
you
really
want
to
support
our
nation's
auto
workers
the
uaw
and
gm
ought
to
tell
congress
to
pass
the
usmca
and
make
sure
there's
more
auto
workers
jobs
for
decades
to
come
he
said
white
house
spokesman
judd
deere
confirmed
tuesday
that
administration
officials
were
not
involved
in
the
negotiations
between
the
union
and
gm
as
president
trump
has
said
we
would
like
to
see
a
fair
and
speedy
conclusion
to
these
talks
he
said
the
president
pays
close
attention
to
the
manufacturing
sector
which
is
an
important
part
of
his
political
base
he
met
with
gm
ceo
mary
barra
earlier
this
month
about
her
decision
to
close
four
us
plants
on
monday
trump
again
touted
the
usmca
at
a
campaign
rally
in
new
mexico
if
passed
the
deal
would
fulfill
one
of
his
campaign
promises
to
tear
up
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
unions
love
it
he
said
of
the
usmca
but
the
uaw
is
far
from
embracing
the
proposed
trade
agreement
in
its
current
form
it
won't
stop
the
shifting
of
auto
production
to
mexico
and
beyond
the
uaw
said
in
a
blog
post
in
august
auto
workers
blame
nafta
for
sending
manufacturing
jobs
south
of
the
border
where
wages
are
lower
the
usmca
addresses
that
by
requiring
more
of
a
vehicle's
parts
to
be
made
by
workers
earning
at
least
an
hour
in
order
to
remain
tariff-free
it
also
adds
a
provision
that
would
require
of
a
vehicle's
parts
to
be
made
in
north
america
up
from
the
current
rule
a
report
from
the
us
international
trade
commission
an
independent
federal
agency
found
that
the
usmca
would
have
a
modest
but
positive
effect
on
jobs
the
study
estimated
that
it
would
add
jobs
in
the
auto
industry
over
six
years
but
also
lead
to
a
small
increase
in
the
price
of
vehicles
that
consumers
pay
but
the
american
automotive
policy
council
which
represents
general
motors
ford
and
fiat-chrysler
criticized
the
agency's
report
for
underestimating
the
long-term
investments
us
automakers
will
make
because
of
the
usmca
a
white
house
report
said
the
auto
provisions
alone
would
create
jobs
and
lead
to
billion
in
new
manufacturing
investments
over
a
five-year
period
industry
analysts
say
it
would
take
a
long
time
before
companies
would
move
capital-intensive
manufacturing
plants
because
of
the
usmca's
requirements
we
don't
think
that
there
are
companies
that
are
going
to
just
close
their
plants
in
mexico
and
move
to
the
united
states
said
michelle
krebs
executive
analyst
at
cox
automotive
we
think
that
in
many
cases
they'll
just
pay
the
penalties
and
keep
doing
what
they're
doing
she
added
some
democratic
lawmakers
are
also
concerned
about
whether
the
wage
provisions
would
be
enforced
under
the
trade
deal
as
its
written
the
usmca's
labor
and
environmental
standards
and
their
enforcement
are
insufficient
to
stop
corporations
from
continuing
to
move
jobs
to
mexico
so
they
can
pay
employees
less
and
dump
toxins
wrote
democratic
michigan
rep
debbie
dingell
in
an
op-ed
piece
published
monday
in
the
washington
post
though
she
added
that
the
labor-reform
laws
passed
by
mexico
earlier
this
year
are
a
step
in
the
right
direction
