third
debate
shows
why
democratic
primary
could
take
a
while
to
decide
juli
n
castro
takes
jab
at
joe
biden's
memory
cnn
it
was
expected
to
be
a
showdown
between
the
three
front-runners
that
would
bare
the
ideological
divide
in
the
democratic
party
instead
it
was
a
disjointed
affair
that
didn't
appear
to
change
the
trajectory
of
the
fight
for
the
democratic
nomination
thursday's
debate
was
a
night
when
lower-polling
candidates
like
former
rep
beto
o'rourke
sen
cory
booker
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
unexpectedly
seized
the
spotlight
from
former
vice
president
joe
biden
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
sen
bernie
sanders
turning
in
improved
performances
that
were
at
times
overshadowed
by
awkward
moments
from
biden's
invocation
of
a
record
player
to
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro's
heavy-handed
attempt
to
seize
barack
obama's
legacy
by
questioning
biden's
age
the
lack
of
a
clear
winner
among
the
candidates
on
the
stage
underscored
a
key
point
about
the
democratic
primary
it
may
be
a
while
before
a
winner
emerges
as
the
democratic
party
wrestles
with
both
an
ideological
divide
and
the
crucial
question
of
whether
it's
time
for
the
next
generation
to
take
up
the
mantle
castro's
jab
stands
out
without
question
the
sharpest
and
most
unforgettable
exchange
of
the
night
was
when
castro
sought
a
breakout
moment
by
using
a
minor
point
in
the
health
care
debate
to
suggest
that
biden
was
losing
his
memory
takeaways
from
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
coming
off
a
spirited
ideological
debate
with
sanders
and
warren
about
his
view
that
their
medicare
for
all
proposal
is
too
expensive
and
will
burden
american
taxpayers
biden
off-handedly
made
a
point
about
his
own
plan
anyone
who
can't
afford
it
gets
automatically
enrolled
in
the
medicare-type
option
we
have
castro
aggressively
cut
biden
off
with
a
jab
about
his
age
are
you
forgetting
what
you
said
two
minutes
ago
are
you
forgetting
already
what
you
said
just
two
minutes
ago
castro
said
as
the
other
candidates
looked
on
slightly
aghast
i
mean
i
can't
believe
that
you
said
two
minutes
ago
that
they
had
to
buy
in
and
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
to
buy
in
you're
forgetting
that
castro
went
on
to
say
in
a
point
that
was
only
partly
correct
that
his
health
care
plan
unlike
biden's
would
automatically
enroll
americans
who
lost
their
jobs
i'm
fulfilling
the
legacy
of
barack
obama
and
you
are
not
castro
said
in
a
final
joust
to
biden
that
will
be
a
surprise
to
him
biden
replied
democrats
push
back
at
personal
attack
after
castro
questions
biden's
memory
it
was
a
stunning
moment
in
a
race
where
the
younger
contenders
have
often
argued
more
gently
perhaps
that
it
is
time
for
a
new
generation
of
leadership
in
making
that
argument
castro
was
attempting
to
relfect
the
concern
voiced
by
many
democratic
voters
that
biden
does
not
seem
as
sharp
as
he
did
during
his
eight
years
as
obama's
vice
president
but
the
former
san
antonio's
mayor
attack
was
so
cringe-worthy
that
several
other
candidates
felt
the
need
to
step
in
this
reminds
everybody
of
what
they
cannot
stand
about
washington
scoring
points
against
each
other
poking
at
each
other
buttigieg
said
yeah
that's
called
the
democratic
primary
election
pete
castro
snapped
back
that's
called
an
election
yes
but
a
house
divided
cannot
stand
minnesota
sen
amy
klobuchar
interjected
drawing
applause
from
the
audience
that
is
not
how
we're
going
to
win
this
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
closed
out
the
exchange
with
a
plea
for
unity
and
an
attempt
to
steer
the
debate
back
to
a
more
substantive
discussion
look
there
are
a
lot
of
people
watching
at
home
right
now
listening
to
us
that
are
afraid
because
they
are
in
crisis
booker
said
he
added
this
must
be
a
moment
where
we
as
democrats
can
begin
to
show
that
we
cannot
only
stake
and
stand
our
ground
but
find
common
ground
because
we've
got
one
shot
to
make
donald
trump
a
one-term
president
candidates
swing
and
a
few
miss
while
the
spat
between
castro
and
biden
was
the
most
memorable
exchange
of
the
night
other
candidates
also
managed
to
leave
some
shaking
their
heads
democratic
debate
speaking
times
california
sen
kamala
harris
had
a
more
uneven
night
than
in
prior
debates
several
of
her
lines
that
had
clearly
been
rehearsed
didn't
land
though
at
one
point
when
talking
about
trump's
trade
policy
she
said
to
laughter
that
the
president
reminds
me
of
that
guy
in
the
wizard
of
oz
you
know
when
you
pull
back
the
curtain
it's
a
really
small
dude
meanwhile
biden
had
some
strong
moments
defending
his
health
care
plan
early
in
the
debate
with
warren
and
sanders
for
example
but
his
answers
were
sometimes
unclear
lacking
a
linear
through
line
as
he
jumped
from
point
to
point
that
was
true
when
he
went
on
a
long
tangent
about
his
efforts
to
bring
home
troops
from
afghanistan
and
in
another
exchange
when
he
veered
from
a
question
about
his
position
on
reparations
into
an
argument
that
children
should
listen
to
the
radio
or
a
record
player
his
sometimes
shaky
performance
may
underscore
concerns
many
democratic
voters
have
about
his
ability
to
take
on
trump
but
he
solidified
his
performance
at
the
end
of
the
night
with
a
strong
answer
about
how
he's
recovered
from
setbacks
he
noted
that
he
was
raised
to
believe
that
family
is
at
the
center
of
everything
fact-check
democratic
debate
from
houston
right
after
i
got
elected
my
wife
and
daughter
were
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
and
my
two
sons
were
badly
injured
and
i
just
had
been
elected
not
sworn
in
and
i
lost
my
faith
for
a
while
i
came
back
biden
said
and
then
later
when
my
son
beau
came
home
from
iraq
and
with
a
terminal
disease
and
a
year
later
year-and-a-half
later
losing
him
was
like
losing
part
of
my
soul
but
the
fact
is
that
i
learned
that
the
way
you
deal
with
it
is
you
deal
with
it
by
finding
purpose
purpose
in
what
you
do
and
that's
why
i
hope
i
hope
he's
proud
of
me
today
businessman
andrew
yang
argued
that
everything
in
america
revolves
around
the
almighty
dollar
and
in
what
his
campaign
had
touted
as
his
big
reveal
and
a
possibly
illegal
gambit
yang
said
he
would
do
something
unprecedented
by
using
some
of
his
campaign
contributions
to
give
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
for
an
entire
year
to
american
families
someone
watching
this
at
home
right
now
after
a
long
pause
buttigieg
who
happened
to
be
up
next
in
the
line
of
opening
statements
dryly
quipped
it's
original
i'll
give
you
that
gun
control
gains
new
prominence
after
shootings
booker
skillfully
turned
specific
policy
questions
into
eloquent
arguments
about
the
need
to
unify
america
when
the
debate
turned
to
the
series
of
mass
shootings
for
example
booker
argued
that
america
needed
to
show
more
courageous
empathy
we
are
never
going
to
solve
this
crisis
if
we
have
to
wait
for
it
to
personally
affect
us
or
our
neighborhood
or
our
community
before
we
demand
action
booker
said
noting
his
own
experience
with
gun
violence
as
mayor
of
newark
i
have
seen
what
the
carnage
creates
in
communities
like
mine
because
we
forget
national
shootings
these
mass
shootings
are
tragedies
but
the
majority
of
the
homicide
victims
come
from
neighborhoods
like
mine
booker
said
beto
o'rourke
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
the
night
was
a
strong
one
not
only
for
booker
who
has
repeatedly
showed
his
command
of
the
finer
points
of
debating
but
also
for
o'rourke
who
has
often
seemed
out
of
his
depth
when
sharing
the
stage
with
his
more
experienced
rivals
after
the
massacre
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
o'rourke
suspended
his
campaign
for
nearly
two
weeks
to
meet
with
victims
families
and
tend
to
his
community
he
spoke
with
passion
about
that
experience
thursday
night
and
did
not
shy
away
from
a
moderator's
question
about
whether
he
would
confiscate
assault-style
weapons
are
you
proposing
taking
away
their
guns
abc
moderator
david
muir
asked
i
am
if
it's
a
weapon
that
was
designed
to
kill
people
on
a
battlefield
o'rourke
said
adding
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
health
care
once
again
exposes
divide
the
first
hour
of
the
debate
laid
bare
the
broad
ideological
divide
in
the
democratic
party
as
the
initial
stages
once
again
focused
on
the
future
of
health
care
in
america
biden
whose
camp
had
made
clear
before
the
debate
that
he
planned
to
go
after
warren
quickly
made
good
on
that
promise
by
attempting
to
distance
her
from
obama
who
remains
one
of
the
most
popular
figures
in
the
democratic
party
debates
confirm
there
is
really
only
one
issue
in
the
democratic
primary
i
know
that
the
senator
says
she's
for
bernie
i'm
for
barack
biden
said
i
think
the
obamacare
worked
i
think
the
way
we
add
to
it
replace
everything
that's
been
cut
add
a
public
option
guarantee
that
everyone
will
be
able
to
have
affordable
insurance
number
one
sidestepping
the
opportunity
to
attack
biden
warren
chose
to
be
gracious
complimenting
the
work
of
the
obama
administration
on
health
care
she
would
not
at
the
moderator's
prompting
say
that
middle
class
americans
taxes
would
go
up
but
she
defended
her
plan
i
actually
never
met
anybody
who
likes
their
health
insurance
company
i've
met
people
who
like
their
doctors
she
said
along
with
their
nurses
their
pharmacists
and
their
physical
therapists
she
added
that
americans
don't
want
to
spend
all
their
time
fighting
with
insurance
companies
sanders
who
has
been
praised
by
biden
as
being
honest
with
the
american
people
that
their
taxes
would
go
up
if
the
country
moves
to
medicare
for
all
weighed
in
by
citing
the
costs
the
country
would
bear
if
the
nation
does
not
move
to
medicare
for
all
americans
don't
want
to
pay
twice
as
much
as
other
countries
and
they
guarantee
health
care
for
all
people
