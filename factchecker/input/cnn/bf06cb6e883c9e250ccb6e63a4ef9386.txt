trump
says
it
looks
like
iran
was
behind
saudi
oil
field
attack
us
says
saudi
arabia
attack
originated
in
iran
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
told
reporters
monday
that
it's
looking
like
iran
was
behind
this
weekend's
attack
on
oil
facilities
in
saudi
arabia
but
suggested
it
was
too
early
to
say
for
sure
he
also
said
he
was
not
looking
to
get
into
new
conflict
but
sometimes
you
have
to
well
it's
looking
that
way
trump
said
in
the
oval
office
when
asked
if
iran
was
responsible
we'll
let
you
know
definitively
that's
being
checked
out
right
now
trump
also
insisted
that
he
does
not
want
war
with
iran
but
he
noted
the
us
has
the
best
weapons
systems
namely
fighter
jets
and
missiles
the
united
states
is
more
prepared
for
a
conflict
than
any
country
in
history
he
said
with
all
that
being
said
we'd
certainly
like
to
avoid
it
trump
indicated
that
the
saudis
may
have
to
pay
if
the
us
launches
military
action
trump's
warning
to
iran
raises
fears
of
war
and
confusion
the
saudis
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
involvement
in
this
if
we
decide
to
do
something
they'll
be
very
much
involved
and
that
includes
payment
he
said
the
president
also
left
the
door
open
for
diplomacy
with
iran
saying
that
path
has
not
yet
been
exhausted
no
it's
never
exhausted
you
never
know
what's
going
to
happen
i
know
they
want
to
make
a
deal
at
some
point
it
will
work
out
he
said
asked
if
he
has
promised
the
saudis
he
will
protect
them
trump
said
no
i
haven't
promised
the
saudis
that
we
have
to
sit
down
with
the
saudis
and
work
something
out
he
added
trump's
special
representative
for
iran
brian
hook
held
a
call
with
staffers
from
capitol
hill
on
monday
to
discuss
the
attacks
according
to
four
sources
familiar
with
the
call
during
that
conversation
hook
said
the
attack
was
definitely
not
carried
out
by
houthi
rebels
who
have
claimed
responsibility
and
was
not
launched
from
iraqi
soil
however
hook
wouldn't
say
who
did
carry
out
the
attack
when
pressed
one
source
familiar
told
cnn
hook
also
said
the
saudis
view
this
attack
as
their
two
sources
said
referring
to
the
terrorist
attacks
on
us
soil
on
on
september
both
sources
said
that
they
felt
hook's
comment
was
inappropriate
in
part
because
there
have
been
no
reported
deaths
as
a
result
of
the
saudi
oil
field
strikes
yet
nearly
americans
were
killed
in
new
york
washington
and
outside
of
shanksville
pennsylvania
in
the
attacks
it's
one
thing
to
tell
us
it
is
another
thing
to
show
us
trump's
comments
come
after
cnn
reported
the
us
has
told
at
least
one
ally
in
the
middle
east
that
it
has
intelligence
showing
that
the
weapons
launch
likely
came
from
staging
grounds
in
iran
but
has
not
shared
that
intelligence
yet
it
is
one
thing
to
tell
us
it
is
another
thing
to
show
us
a
diplomat
from
the
region
said
monday
a
us
official
separately
told
cnn
that
the
us
has
assessed
that
the
attack
originated
from
inside
iran
the
official
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
are
not
authorized
to
talk
to
the
press
still
us
officials
have
not
offered
any
evidence
proving
iran
was
behind
the
attack
or
that
the
strike
originated
from
iranian
territory
the
pentagon
declined
to
comment
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
state
department
spokesperson
told
cnn
we
do
not
comment
on
intelligence
matters
the
wall
street
journal
first
reported
that
the
us
was
telling
countries
in
the
region
that
the
attacks
were
launched
from
inside
iran
a
spokesman
for
the
saudi-led
coalition
in
yemen
col
turki
al-malki
said
in
a
news
conference
monday
that
iranian
weapons
were
also
used
in
the
oil
field
attack
and
that
the
strikes
were
not
launched
from
yemen
despite
claims
of
responsibility
by
houthi
rebels
operating
there
after
the
saudi
oil
attacks
all
options
carry
great
risk
all
practical
evidence
and
indicators
and
the
weapons
used
in
both
attacks
show
preliminarily
that
these
are
iranian
weapons
he
said
without
providing
details
about
the
weapons
themselves
yemen's
iran-backed
houthi
rebels
claimed
responsibility
on
saturday
saying
they
had
conducted
the
strikes
using
drones
in
retaliation
for
saudi
arabia's
military
campaign
against
the
group
in
the
country
while
the
houthis
have
used
attack
drones
in
the
past
those
attacks
have
typically
been
launched
against
saudi
targets
close
to
the
border
the
recent
attack
against
saudi
oil
facilities
would
represent
a
major
improvement
in
the
houthis
ability
to
accurately
hit
targets
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
previously
demonstrated
al-malki
said
saudi
arabia
is
still
working
on
identifying
the
exact
launch
location
but
noted
that
all
the
preliminary
evidence
indicates
that
the
terror
attack
was
not
launched
from
yemeni
territory
as
claimed
by
the
houthi
militias
these
militias
are
just
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
iranian
revolutionary
guards
used
to
implement
the
agenda
and
wishes
of
the
revolutionary
guards
and
the
iranian
terrorist
regime
the
colonel
added
on
sunday
trump
tweeted
that
the
us
has
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
who
is
responsible
for
an
attack
on
a
saudi
arabian
oil
field
and
the
country
is
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
following
the
crippling
strike
attacks
have
disrupted
of
the
world's
oil
production
here's
what
you
need
to
know
though
trump
did
not
name
iran
in
his
tweet
the
attack
has
caused
another
spike
in
tensions
between
the
us
and
tehran
prior
to
saturday
there
had
been
signs
that
the
us
appeared
open
to
new
negotiations
and
even
a
potential
meeting
later
this
month
between
trump
and
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
iran
denies
involvement
on
saturday
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
seyyed
abbas
mousavi
rejected
the
accusation
that
iran
was
behind
the
attack
such
blind
accusations
and
inappropriate
comments
in
a
diplomatic
context
are
incomprehensible
and
meaningless
he
said
adding
even
hostility
needs
a
certain
degree
of
credibility
and
reasonable
frameworks
us
officials
have
also
violated
these
basic
principles
marc
short
the
vice
president's
chief
of
staff
told
reporters
monday
morning
that
the
president's
claim
the
us
is
locked
and
loaded
may
not
refer
to
military
action
i
think
that
locked
and
loaded
is
a
broad
term
and
talks
about
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
short
said
this
is
not
the
s
oil
embargo
it's
not
when
iraq
invaded
kuwait
we're
now
a
net
oil
exporter
which
means
that
the
american
market
is
much
better
protected
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
has
explicitly
blamed
iran
for
the
attack
but
has
also
yet
to
offer
any
evidence
to
support
that
claim
pompeo
and
other
administration
officials
will
soon
travel
to
saudi
arabia
according
to
trump
kelly
craft
the
us
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
reiterated
that
assertion
monday
while
addressing
the
attacks
during
an
unrelated
security
council
meeting
on
yemen
claims
of
responsibility
have
been
made
but
as
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
has
clearly
stated
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
attacks
came
from
yemen
emerging
information
indicates
that
responsibility
lies
with
iran
she
said
short
told
reporters
monday
he's
quite
confident
that
pompeo
will
release
evidence
that
directly
ties
these
attacks
to
iran
there's
no
doubt
that
iran
has
been
a
malign
actor
on
the
stage
here
and
has
been
supporting
the
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
but
i
think
there's
certainly
greater
evidence
that
he'll
be
sharing
that
directly
ties
these
attacks
to
iran
he
said
the
claim
is
reminiscent
of
when
pompeo
blamed
iran
for
an
attack
on
two
tankers
in
the
gulf
of
oman
earlier
this
summer
without
presenting
evidence
directly
tying
iran
to
the
attacks
what
countries
in
the
region
decide
to
do
in
reaction
to
the
saudi
oil
field
attack
largely
depends
on
what
the
us
is
willing
to
do
a
us
official
said
cnn
previously
reported
that
pompeo
is
expected
to
speak
with
the
united
arab
emirates
crown
prince
on
monday
and
to
other
nations
