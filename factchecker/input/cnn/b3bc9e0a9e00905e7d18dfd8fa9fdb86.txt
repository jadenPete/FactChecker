to
transfer
acres
of
federal
land
to
army
for
border
wall
construction
washington
cnn
the
interior
department
announced
wednesday
that
it
will
soon
transfer
acres
along
the
us-mexico
border
to
the
army
to
allow
for
border
wall
construction
the
five
parcels
comprise
land
in
arizona
california
and
new
mexico
the
department
said
and
will
be
used
to
construct
miles
of
border
barrier
in
addition
to
the
national
security
humanitarian
and
related
values
impacted
by
unlawful
border
crossing
emergency
measures
are
necessary
to
preserve
natural
resource
values
casey
hammond
an
acting
assistant
interior
secretary
said
on
a
conference
call
with
reporters
the
department's
announcement
of
the
land
transfer
comes
the
same
day
president
donald
trump
toured
a
section
of
border
wall
in
california
as
part
of
a
fundraising
trip
the
visit
and
trump's
praise
for
the
wall
signal
that
border
security
will
be
a
cornerstone
of
his
reelection
bid
as
it
was
in
hammond
said
the
transfer
is
in
the
interior
department's
interest
because
people
illegally
crossing
the
border
in
the
area
create
new
roads
damage
native
vegetation
disturb
wildlife
and
generate
tons
of
garbage
and
human
waste
the
land
is
currently
held
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
the
department
said
it
has
previously
transferred
land
for
various
other
projects
but
never
for
border
barrier
construction
trump
claimed
wednesday
that
we're
building
a
lot
of
wall
as
he
has
repeatedly
since
taking
office
in
fact
no
new
sections
of
wall
have
been
built
along
the
southern
border
where
some
form
of
barrier
didn't
already
exist
the
department
of
defense
is
diverting
an
estimated
billion
in
military
construction
funds
to
help
build
the
wall
even
though
trump
repeatedly
claimed
that
mexico
would
foot
the
bill
earlier
this
month
the
pentagon
released
the
full
list
of
military
construction
projects
that
will
lose
funds
in
order
to
help
construct
miles
of
southern
border
wall
