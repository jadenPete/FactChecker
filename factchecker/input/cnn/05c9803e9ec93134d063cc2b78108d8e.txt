cnn
an
internal
draft
document
reviewed
by
cnn
reveals
how
individual
offices
within
the
bureau
of
land
management
will
be
spread
out
across
states
and
time
zones
under
the
agency's
proposed
reorganization
plan
putting
federal
workers
who
once
worked
together
in
washington
thousands
of
miles
apart
the
plan
has
left
some
officials
lawmakers
and
former
bureau
employees
confused
about
the
agency's
goals
in
moving
certain
positions
out
west
the
agency
which
has
an
annual
budget
of
more
than
billion
and
manages
over
million
acres
of
public
land
is
moving
its
headquarters
from
washington
to
grand
junction
colorado
the
bureau
of
land
management
headquarters
has
been
in
washington
for
decades
with
state-level
offices
spread
across
the
country
as
a
part
of
this
reorganization
the
bureau
will
move
some
people
who
work
in
the
washington
headquarters
to
the
new
headquarters
in
colorado
but
it
will
also
move
some
headquarter-level
workers
to
state
offices
others
in
the
washington
headquarters
will
be
moved
to
state
offices
to
perform
state-level
jobs
the
internal
draft
document
shows
plans
to
move
employees
within
the
same
office
like
the
foia
office
which
handles
freedom
of
information
act
requests
for
the
agency
to
different
states
it
also
shows
that
some
employees
who
work
closely
with
congress
or
other
dc-based
agencies
are
being
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
country
employees
will
be
notified
of
their
relocation
postings
this
week
according
to
the
bureau
of
land
management's
acting
director
william
perry
pendley
the
exact
number
of
employees
that
will
be
impacted
by
this
move
is
unclear
but
critics
say
these
relocations
are
a
thinly
veiled
attempt
to
break
up
the
federal
bureaucracy
while
the
administration
feels
the
moves
are
long
overdue
interior
department
threatens
lawmakers
who
complain
about
moving

shepard
former
bureau
of

management
assistant
director
and
president
of
the
public
lands
foundation
a
nonpartisan
advocacy
group
made
up
of
former
bureau
of
land
management
employees
told
cnn
the
change
is
going
to
be
very
effective
at
dismantling
the
agency
that's
going
to
be
a
consequence
of
these
things
shepard
who
worked
at
the
agency
for
years
of
which
he
spent
in
the
washington
headquarters
told
cnn
that
of
bureau
staff
is
already
based
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia
primarily
in
western
states
the
washington
headquarters
makes
up
only
of
the
agency's
total
staff
when
they're
working
on
a
policy
or
new
regulation
these
people
have
to
work
together
closely
and
not
just
by
picking
up
a
telephone
shepard
said
when
you're
not
together
sometimes
you
forget
to
talk
when
cnn
asked
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
the
interior
department
about
the
internal
document
the
agencies
did
not
address
the
document
directly
or
answer
questions
about
why
certain
offices
were
being
split
among
different
states
under
our
proposal
every
western
state
will
gain
additional
staff
resources
interior
secretary
david
bernhardt
said
in
a
statement
shifting
critical
leadership
positions
and
supporting
staff
to
western
states
where
an
overwhelming
majority
of
federal
lands
are
located
is
not
only
a
better
management
system
it
is
beneficial
to
the
interest
of
the
american
public
decentralization
as
reorganization
pendley
told
the
house
natural
resources
committee
that
jobs
will
be
moving
to
perform
headquarters
functions
in
state

and
jobs
will
be
moved
to
state

to
perform
state
jobs
the
document
shows
that
some
offices
now
located
in
the
dc
headquarters
are
not
simply
moving
to
the
new
headquarters
in
colorado
but
are
being
split
internally
among
different
offices
out
west
the
foia
office
which
has
been
based
at
the
headquarters
level
in
washington
will
be

more
than
miles
from
washington
five
foia
specialists
are
also
moving
but
not
to
the
same
place
three
will
be
more
than
miles
from
the
records
administrator
and
more
than
miles
from
washington
in
reno
nevada
another
two
will
be
more
than

from
washington
in

several
jobs
that

are
being
moved
to
different

out

one
of
those
positions
works
closely
with
the

according
to
its
job
description
an

which
serves
as
the
bureau

are
being
moved
to
reno
legislative
affairs
specialists
work
directly
with
congressional
staff
and
members
on
agency
policy
and
issues
shepard
said
he
doesn't
understand
some
of
those
moves
particularly
moving
legislative
affairs
people
to
reno
they
are
pretty
much
solely
working
with
staff
up
in
congress
he
said
lawmakers
split
on
the
decision
the
bureau's
move
first
announced
in
july
is
the
latest
disruption
for
federal
workers
two
departments
within
the
us
department
of
agriculture
made
up
of
more
than
federal
workers
the
economic
research
service
and
the
national
institute
of
food
and
agriculture
will
move
to
kansas
city
this
year
as
well
the
bureau
and
the
usda
have
publicly
argued
that
the
relocation
will
cut
costs
by
moving
employees
to
areas
with
lower
costs
of
living
than
washington
but
many
who
oppose
the
move
point
to
comments
made
by
mick
mulvaney
in
august
at
a
republican
party
event
in
south
carolina
now
it's
nearly
impossible
to
fire
a
federal
worker
mulvaney
the
office
of
management
and
budget
director
and
acting
white
house
chief
of
staff
said
at
the
time
according
to
the
washington
post
i
know
that
because
a
lot
of
them
work
for
me
and
i've
tried
and
you
can't
do
it
but
simply
saying
to
the
people
you
know
what
we're
going
to
take
you
outside
the
bubble
outside
the
beltway
outside
the
liberal
haven
and
move
you
out
into
the
real
part
of
the
country
and
they
quit
what
a
wonderful
way
to
streamline
government
and
do
what
we
haven't
been
able
to
do
for
a
long
time
rep
karen
bass
told
cnn
last
week
that
the
bureau's
decision
is
just
another
egregious
example
of
how
the
trump
administration
wants
to
unravel
different
protections
that
we've
had
for
many
many
years
so
let's
just
get
rid
of
all
federal
employees
so
the
way
we're
going
to
do
that
is
move
and
then
give
them
a
very
short
period
of
time
in
which
they
have
to
get
their
lives
together
which
is
just
another
way
of
firing
everybody
the
california
democrat
said
house
natural
resources
chairman
raul
grijalva
an
arizona
democrat
argued
that
the
reorganization
appears
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
poorly
veiled
attempt
to
dismantle
a
federal
agency
some
gop
lawmakers
have
defended
the
decision
we
are
still
screwing
up
how
we're
administering
lands
because
we
are
thousands
of
miles
away
house
natural
resources
committee
ranking
member
rob
bishop
a
utah
republican
told
cnn
last
week
the
idea
is
moving
it
out
there
where
the
people
are
where
the
land
is
that
makes
total
sense
sen
cory
gardner
told
cnn
last
week
the
idea
that
these
jobs
can
be
done
only
in
washington
is
an
attack
on
the
west
this
is
going
to
result
in
better
decision
making
ninety-nine
percent
of
the
acres
are
west
of
the
mississippi
river
the
colorado
republican
said
i
believe
in
colorado
i
support
colorado
and
i
think
they
are
really
smart
people
who
do
a
great
job
and
it's
shameful
to
think
that
only
washington
can
do
this
pendley
said
moving
employees
to
state
offices
to
perform
both
headquarter-level
and
state-level
jobs
is
a
bonus
for
the
states
every
western
state
will
benefit
from
an
infusion
of
experts
he
said
under
pressure
the
bureau
of
land
management
move
comes
at
a
time
when
the
federal
workforce
is
facing
upheaval
on
several
fronts
the
commerce
department
is
undergoing
two
internal
investigations
after
reports
came
out
that
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
employees
were
being
told
to
support
the
president's
statements
that
hurricane
dorian's
projected
path
included
alabama
and
the
usda
has
faced
its
own
reorganization
when
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
announced
his
department's
move
in
june
employees
stood
and
turned
their
backs
on
him
out
of
roughly
economic
research
service
researchers
and
economists
at
the
usda
reassigned
to
kansas
city
said
they
would
not
move
according
to
a
survey
conducted
by
the
american
federation
of
government
employees
out
of
employees
in
a
different
usda
office
said
they
would
not
move
according
to
the
survey
the
usda
recently
announced
that
workers
who
are
declining
to
move
can
stay
on
at
the
agency
longer
because
it
fears
a
worker
shortage
could
disrupt
its
ability
to
complete
its
mission
during
a
congressional
hearing
last
week
pendley
said
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
not
taken
any
survey
of
the
number
of
employees
who
plan
to
leave
rather
than
relocate
because
it
did
not
conduct
any
survey
or
cost-benefit
analysis
about
the
reorganizations
before
moving
forward
with
its
plans
there
is
no
way
to
know
how
many
employees
will
leave
the
bureau
as
a
result
of
their
reassignments
