summer's
over
on
capitol
hill
washington
cnn
it
was
back
to
business
in
washington
this
week
as
congress
returned
from
its
six-week
summer
recess
to
get
back
to
work
but
it
wasn't
exactly
business
as
usual
house
democrats
face
a
new
math
equation
now
that
more
than
half
of
the
caucus
supports
impeachment
and
that
split
over
how
to
proceed
around
impeachment
played
out
in
a
big
way
depending
on
who
you
asked
this
week
democrats
may
or
may
not
have
made
a
step
forward
on
impeaching
president
donald
trump
house
judiciary
chair
jerry
nadler
on
thursday
led
his
committee
to
what
he
called
the
first
vote
on
impeachment
it's
a
largely
procedural
vote
that
defined
the
parameters
of
an
investigation
into
impeachment
some
call
this
process
an
impeachment
inquiry
some
call
it
an
impeachment
investigation
there
is
no
legal
difference
between
these
terms
and
i
no
longer
care
to
argue
about
the
nomenclature
nadler
said
but
let
me
clear
up
any
remaining
doubt
the
conduct
under
investigation
poses
a
threat
to
our
democracy
we
have
an
obligation
to
respond
to
this
threat
and
we
are
doing
so
but
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
wouldn't
call
it
that
literally
in
a
press
conference
shortly
after
the
vote
pelosi
swiftly
rebuffed
efforts
by
reporters
to
clarify
what
exactly
the
judiciary
committee
had
just
approved
and
refused
to
call
it
impeachment
i
support
what
is
happening
in
the
judiciary
committee
that
enables
them
to
do
their
process
of
interrogation
and
their
investigation
and
i
salute
them
for
that
work
