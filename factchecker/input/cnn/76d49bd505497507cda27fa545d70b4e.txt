how

may
bulldoze

alaska
cnn
in
the
hottest
alaskan
summer
on
record
amid
countless
signs
of
a
climate
in
crisis
a
camera
phone
captured
a
republican
fundraiser
on
kenai
peninsula
judging
from
the
laughs
and
smiles
you'd
never
know
that
they
are
a
few
dozen
miles
from
the
swan
lake
fire
now
burning
for
over
three
months
but
the
mood
is
giddy
because
a
surprise
caller
is
on
speaker
president
trump
holding
up
the
phone
in
one
hand
and
swatting
at
late-season
hornets
with
the
other
sen
dan
sullivan
nods
and
grins
as
trump
promises
to
fulfill
a
republican
wish
list
that
environmentalists
have
been
fighting
for
generations
alaska
just
had
the
most
ridiculous
summer
that's
a
red
flag
for
the
planet
he
mentions
drilling
for
oil
in
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
way
up

and
building
a
road
through
the

dunleavy
who
has
been
bonding
with
trump
during
air
force
one
refueling
stops
often
bringing
a
list
of
rules
and
restrictions
he
wants
overturned
with
oil
prices
down
alaska's
budget
is
deep
in
the
red
and
dunleavy
is
looking
for
other
industry
to
help
he's
a
great
guy
trump
says
of
dunleavy
over
the
speaker
and
he's
doing
something
with
your
logging
and
all
your
other
things
we're
working
on
that
together
and
that's
moving
along
while
nature
lovers
and
earth
scientists
have
been
fighting
alaskan
politicians
over
anwr
and
king
cove
road
for
decades
trump's
mention
of
logging
reopens
a
different
front
in
an
old
war
because
everyone
knows
he's
talking
about
tongass
the
crown
jewel
of
the
national
forest
system
spread
across
the
islands
and
fjords
of
the
alaskan
panhandle
tongass
is
roughly
the
size
of
west
virginia
full
of
towering
old
growth
spruce
cedar
and
hemlock
some
trees
twice
as
old
as
america
itself
it
traps
and
hold
so
much
carbon
it's
known
as
america's
amazon
the
pristine
wilderness
holds
a
bounty
of
salmon
bears
wolves
eagles
and
whales
living
alongside
around
people
and
in
the
little
town
of
tenakee
springs
the
reaction
is
one
of
shock
and
dismay
after
all
the
work
that
we
put
in
to
keep
this
area
roadless
and
keep
this
as
pristine
as
we
possibly
can

captain
tuck
harry
says
as
he
shakes
his
head
and
would
you
characterize
yourself
as
sort
of
a
tree-hugging
liberal
i
ask
him
he
laughs
no
not
at
all
not
a
tree-hugging
liberal
at
all
he
says
looking
across
a
mirror-flat
tenakee
inlet
at
hillsides
once
scarred
by
clear-cuts
he's
been
here
since
back
when
the
forestry
service
treated
alaska
more
as
america's
lumberyard
than
sanctuary
in
an
effort
to
create
jobs
in
the
last
frontier
thousand-year-old
forests
were
pulped
into
paper
but
after
years
of
legal
battles
and
negotiations
a
clinton-era
roadless
rule
seemed
to
settle
the
issue
protecting
tongass
from
any
new
logging
or
mining
interests
but
trump's
fundraiser
call
last
month
confirmed
reports
that
he
would
encourage
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
to
exempt
tongass
from
the
roadless
rule
opening
almost
million
acres
to
development
as
governor
i've
raised
this
issue
with
the
trump
administration
on
numerous
occasions
each
time
underscoring
the
need
to
restore
the
tongass
multiple
use
mandate
to
allow
for
activities
such
as
tourism
timber
mining
hydropower
and
more
reads
a
statement
to
cnn
from
dunleavy
but
the
former
mayor
of
tenakee
springs
art
bloom
says
it
is
impossible
to
have
all
of
those
industries
in
tongass
at
the
same
time
alaska
has
to
choose
people
on
cruise
ships
don't
want
to
look
at
denuded
hillsides
he
says
they
come
here
because
of
what's
still
here
they
wouldn't
be
coming
here
if
it
was
a
bunch
of
stumps
bloom
a
fish
biologist
who
came
up
to
alaska
in
the
s
and
is
now
a
commercial
salmon
fisherman
explains
the
importance
of
the
land
to
the
sea
walking
across
the
spongy
forest
floor
he
says
intact
old-growth
forest
is
the
only
reason
alaska
has
such
a
thriving
fishery
along
the
streams
the
trees
keep
the
water
temperatures
cool
so
the
salmon
depend
on
the
trees
to
reproduce
the
trees
depend
on
the
salmon
to
bring
nutrients
in
from
the
ocean
he
says
you
could
never
have
this
again
once
you
cut
it
it's
going
to
come
back
as
an
even-aged
stand
that
needs
to
be
managed
and
that
is
a
plantation
and
not
a
forest
and
that
won't
support
the
wildlife
that
this
supports
his
daughter
lindsay
bloom
herself
a
fishing
captain
and
now
a
strategist
for
the
salmon
state
advocacy
group
has
her
eye
on
the
future
and
what
she
wants
for
her
young
children
first
of
all
health
and
wellness
and
clean
air
clean
water
and
food
supply
she
says
and
then
secondly
when
i
think
about
their
future
jobs
it's
something
they
can
do
that
regenerates
itself
like
we're
really
proud
of
being
fishermen
you
know
because
it's
regenerative
and
multi-generational
and
if
we
manage
it
right
we
can
do
it
forever
but
she's
worried
that
is
now
at
risk
logger
gordon
chew
acknowledges
there's
nobody
in
this
town
that
a
mile
of
road
here
or
there
would
benefit
more
than
me
a
mile
of
road
built
into
an
area
that's
never
been
logged
would
be
almost
a
lifetime
of
selective
logging
for
me
he
says
chew
runs
a
milling
company
with
his
son
while
he
believes
that
old
growth
can
be
sustainably
harvested
one
tree
a
time
he
is
terrified
of
a
return
to
the
clear-cutting
days
of
the
past
when
you
build
a
road
you
don't
know
what's
going
to
come
down
the
road
and
the
reason
that
you
would
build
a
million-dollar-a-mile
road
is
to
extract
resources
big
time
we're
just
very
much
against
that
he
says
while
fishing
and
tourism
make
up
a
quarter
of
southeastern
alaska's
economy
timber
provides
less
than
with
a
total
of
jobs
in
according
to
the
southeast
conference
a
coalition
of
communities
and
businesses
in
alaska
but
much
the
way
trump
has
vowed
to
help
the
outdated
industry
of
the
coal
miners
in
the
lower
dunleavy
seems
determined
to
boost
the
number
of
lumberjacks
as
a
resources-oriented
state
with
the
highest
unemployment
in
the
nation
we
continue
to
work
with
our
federal
partners
towards
solutions
that
support
economic
growth
and
opportunity
reads
the
governor's
statement
interactive
alaska
at
a
crossroads
but
fishing
guide
tuck
harry
urges
him
to
take
a
wider
view
i
have
many
many
logging
friends
but
even
a
lot
of
them
are
now
on
the
side
of
protecting
the
environment
he
says
with
a
gravely
growl
when
i
go
down
and
talk
to
some
of
my
oldest
friends
of
years
they
can
see
what's
happened
they
can
see
the
degradation
of
the
streams
down
there
that's
not
what
we
want
to
have
happen
here
he
says
so
to
the
governor
and
the
president
this
is
what
i'm
saying
do
not
do
this
to
us
