ivanka
trump's
push
to
empower
women
is
undermined
by
her
father's
policies
experts
say
washington
cnn
ivanka
trump
swept
through
three
latin
american
countries
last
week
to
promote
women's
entrepreneurship
and
empowerment
a
mission
that
faces
regional
headwinds
of
wage
inequality
staggering
levels
of
violence
against
women
high
rates
of
adolescent
pregnancy
and
experts
say
the
policies
of
her
own
administration
in
promoting
her
women's
global
development
and
prosperity
initiative
ms
trump
emphasizes
the
link
between
stable
productive
societies
and
women's
ability
to
work
connections
borne
out
by
research
but
experts
say
a
key
factor
enabling
women
to
thrive
economically
is
their
ability
to
control
when
and
how
many
children
they
have
they
say
that
ability
is
being
undermined
across
the
globe
by
the
trump
administration
which
is
hurting
women
and
hurting
women's
access
to
basic
care
and
puts
lives
in
danger
as
us
states
pass
laws
to
limit
abortion
and
possibly
trigger
a
supreme
court
challenge
to
the
roe
v
wade
ruling
that
legalized
the
procedure
the
trump
white
house
is
making
unprecedented
efforts
to
ensure
no
us
government
funds
are
used
to
provide
or
promote
abortion
overseas
paradoxically
studies
show
those
efforts
are
only
likely
to
increase
the
number
of
abortions
taking
place
wide
impact
the
administration's
protecting
life
in
global
health
assistance
policy
is
affecting
us
global
health
spending
not
only
on
abortion
but
on
contraception
reproductive
health
and
everything
from
child
nutrition
to
tuberculosis
treatment
as
well
it
has
sent
aid
groups
scrambling
to
prevent
maternal
and
newborn
deaths
in
jordanian
refugee
camps
and
struggling
to
respond
to
an
explosion
in
sex
trafficking
along
the
venezuelan
border
the
us
policy
has
led
to
the
closure
of
mobile
health
clinics
in
uganda
and
zimbabwe
ended
a
contraception
program
for
poor
women
in
madagascar
and
cut
into
programs
intended
to
prevent
hiv
malaria
and
the
zika
virus
experts
say
the
approach
not
only
undermines
ivanka
trump's
program
but
also
president
donald
trump's
official
peace
and
security
strategy
which
recognizes
that
societies
that
empower
women
economically
and
politically
are
far
more
stable
and
peaceful
trump
strategy
on
women
and
security
wins
wary
praise
raises
questions
the
reality
of
what
the
evidence
says
is
that
you
cannot
achieve
those
goals
if
you
don't
have
access
to
comprehensive
sex
education
family
planning
safe
access
to
abortion

center
an
ngo
focused
on
global
health
and
development
research
if
you
work
with
women
and
girls
it's
impossible
to
do
that
if
you
don't
do
those
other
things
a
senior
administration
official
said
ivanka
trump's
efforts
don't
touch
on
important
health
issues
but
are
focused
entirely
on
the
workforce
and
the
women
who
have
restrictions
on
the
ability
to
do
the
same
jobs
as
men
it
is
a
narrow
focus
because
we
want
to
make
sure
that
it
has
tangible
results
ms
trump's
program
aims
to
help
million
women
in
developing
countries
worldwide
by
by
giving
them
job
training
and
eliminating
barriers
to
the
workplace
trump
encouraged
cote
d'ivoire's
recent
decision
to
do
away
with
laws
that
restricted
women
from
owning
or
inheriting
property
her
latin
america
trip
took
her
to
colombia
argentina
and
paraguay
where
she
met
with
women
and
officials
launched
an
entrepreneurship
program
and
announced
the
us
intent
to
fund
investment
managers
who
consider
gender
latin
america
needs
such
initiatives
experts
say
the
world
bank
says
women
there
typically
become
a
mother
too
young
earn
less
than
men
and
often
live
in
fear
the
region
is
home
to
of
countries
with
the
highest
femicide
rates
in
the
world
the
trump
administration
has
been
very
strongly
committed
to
women's
issues
and
women's
empowerment
programs
throughout
its
tenure
the
official
said
trump's
latin
america
trip
is
just
another
example
of
our
strong
demonstration
of
commitment
giselle
carino
the
ceo
and
regional
director
of
international
planned
parenthood
federation's
operations
in
latin
america
said
ms
trump's
initiative
and
us
policy
make
for
a
contradiction
planned
parenthood
drops
federal
funding
over
abortion-referral
restriction
to
have
ivanka
trump
in
colombia
when
the
administration
is
cutting
resources
to
women
who
have
experienced
the
most
difficult
circumstances
it's
a
contradiction
the
administration
is
hurting
women
and
hurting
women's
access
to
basic
care
at
the
same
time
it's
going
around
talking
about
women's
empowerment
those
are
empty
promises
carino
said
without
having
bodily
autonomy
you
can't
really
have
equality
the
trump
administration
inherited
what
was
once
called
the
mexico
city
policy
the
measure
has
been
adopted
by
republican
administrations
and
dropped
by
democratic
ones
since
its
creation
in
and
previously
affected
about
million
in
aid
for
family
planning
clinics
clinics
that
even
discussed
abortion
would
lose
their
funding
for
contraception
and
reproductive
health
care
giving
rise
to
the
policy's
other
name
the
global
gag
rule
under
trump
the
white
house
has
dramatically
expanded
the
policy
to
cover
an
estimated
billion
in
global
health
spending
hospitals
and
aid
groups
that
receive
us
aid
have
to
certify
that
they
will
not
use
funds
from
any
source
even
non-us
donors
to
perform
or
discuss
abortion
if
they
do
they
lose
all
us
aid
including
funding
for
health
programs
that
range
from
maternal
and
child
health
to
sanitation
and
treatments
for
cancer
and
tropical
diseases
abortion
wasn't
always
taboo
in
america
in
march
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
expanded
the
rule
yet
again
announcing
that
the
us
would
cut
funds
to
ngos
that
fund
other
groups
that
support
abortion
pompeo
defended
the
policy
to
an
audience
in
kansas
on
friday
we
still
want
to
support
women's
health
issues
all
around
the
world
all
of
things
that
are
important
values
things
that
we
all
hold
dear
he
said
but
we've
been
diligent
in
trying
to
protect
the
unborn
in
every
dimension
of
american
foreign
policy
and
we'll
continue
to
be
data
show
the
policy
isn't
having
its
intended
effect
a
stanford
university
study
published
by
the
lancet
global
health
journal
in
june
found
that
the
trump
administration's
expanded
efforts
to
end
abortion
instead
increase
it
by
and
create
a
greater
risk
of
women
dying
the
study's
findings
provide
only
a
partial
estimate
of
the
policy's
harm
to
maternal
health
the
authors
said
when
the
us
cuts
funding
contraceptive
use
drops
unintended
pregnancies
rise
and
women
opt
for
abortions
often
unsafe
ones
that
are
a
major
cause
of
maternal
death
alarm
bells
research
by
rutgers
university
in
and
stanford
university
in
shows
that
the
original
mexico
city
policy
caused
abortion
rates
in
african
countries
to
double
in
latin
america
women
were
up
to
three
times
more
likely
to
have
the
procedure
the
stanford
study
should
compel
the
trump
administration
to
finally
reexamine
this
disastrous
policy
said
sen
jeanne
shaheen
a
new
hampshire
democrat
who
sits
on
the
foreign
relations
committee
the
statistics
she
added
should
ring
alarm
bells
for
policy
makers
administration
officials
sidestep
or
outright
deny
the
impact
asked
why
the
administration
is
pursuing
a
policy
that
increases
abortion
the
state
department
pointed
to
comments
pompeo
made
in
march
when
he
was
asked
about
the
documented
rise
in
abortions
they're
just
wrong
said
pompeo
declining
to
address
studies
and
on-the-ground
reports
they're
just
wrong
about
that
the
administration
is
entitled
to
its
own
opinion
of
course
kate
gilmore
the
united
nations
deputy
high
commissioner
for
human
rights
said
but
it
is
not
entitled
to
its
own
facts
the
epidemiology
and
the
medical
science
is
unequivocal
gilmore
said
in
june
at
women
deliver
a
conference
on
women
development
and
security
the
policies
that
are
being
enacted
will
lead
to
more
deaths
of
pregnant
women
of
women
at
the
point
of
giving
birth
and
of
the
newborn
devastating
impact
asked
for
comment
the
white
house
referred
cnn
to
usaid
where
an
official
pointed
to
a
common
administration
defense
that
the
policy
does
not
change
funding
levels
by
one
dollar
workers
in
the
field
say
this
ignores
the
fact
that
the
funding
doesn't
go
to
the
same
places
the
shift
also
often
leaves
poor
women
rural
residents
and
marginalized
groups
such
as
sex
workers
suddenly
cut
off
from
health
services
international
aid
groups
say
the
impact
is
stark
dr
carole
sekimpi
a
country
director
for
marie
stopes
international
which
provides
reproductive
health
care
services
said
her
group
lost
of
its
funding
or
million
through
this
continues
to
have
devastating
impact
on
the
most
vulnerable
women
and
girls
around
the
world
she
said
as
a
direct
result
of
the
global
gag
rule
million
women
and
girls
globally
will
lose
access
to
marie
stopes
services
and
care
and
this
will
result
in
an
estimated
million
unintended
pregnancies
unsafe
abortions
and
maternal
deaths
ann
erb-leoncavallo
a
senior
advisor
in
the
global
humanitarian
division
of
the
unfpa
said
that
if
other
donor
countries
hadn't
made
up
for
us
funding
cuts
to
their
programs
in
jordan's
za'atari
refugee
camp
home
to
thousands
of
displaced
syrians
there
would
be
an
increase
in
maternal
and
newborn
deaths
for
sure
no
other
country
but
the
us
cuts
still
have
an
impact
she
said
we
are
doing
less
than
what
we
needed
erb-leoncavallo
said
if
half
of
the
amount
is
coming
we
are
reaching
half
of
the
population
in
need
she
said
marta
roya
executive
director
of
profamilia
a
nationwide
chain
of
reproductive
health
care
clinics
in
colombia
said
they
had
to
close
three
centers
in
the
poorest
parts
of
the
country
that
provided
basic
care
for
women
the
us
funding
cuts
come
as
demands
have
been
particularly
intense
she
said
with
millions
of
venezuelans
fleeing
to
colombia
in
the
largest
recorded
refugee
crisis
in
the
americas
the
impact
she
said
has
been
absolutely
enormous
this
time
the
gag
rule
has
expanded
not
only
to
what
we're
used
to
but
it
has
also
intruded
into
things
like
hiv
zika
roya
said
you
have
these
programs
going
on
all
the
time
and
then
suddenly
they
stop
carino
of
the
international
planned
parenthood
said
that
other
countries
have
tried
to
step
in
and
make
up
for
the
loss
of
us
funding
carino
added
but
no
other

can
fill
the
gap
