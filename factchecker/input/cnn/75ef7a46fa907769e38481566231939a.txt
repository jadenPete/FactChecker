fact
check
trump
makes
six
false
claims
in
tweets
on
why
he
shouldn't
be
impeached
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
made
a
three-tweet
argument
friday
morning
about
why
he
should
not
be
impeached
touting
what
he
said
were
his
accomplishments
over
the
course
of
words
he
made
six
false
claims
plus
three
others
that
aren't
false
but
could
benefit
from
additional
context
let's
go
claim
by
claim
first
the
false
claims
in
the
order
he
tweeted
them
unemployment
for
asian
americans
and
women
all
time
best
unemployment
numbers
especially
for
blacks
hispanics
asians
women
trump
said
facts
first
the
unemployment
rates
for
black
and
hispanic
people
are
indeed
at
record
lows
at
least
since
the
government
adopted
its
current
methodology
for
tracking
those
figures
in
the
s
but
the
rates
for
asian
americans
and
women
are
not
at
their
all
time
best
the
unemployment
rate
for
asian
americans
was
in
august
higher
than
the
in
december
obama's
last
full
month
in
office
the
rate
did
fall
to
a
record
low
under
trump
in
may
but
it
then
increased
trump
continued
claiming
he
had
the
record
even
after
that
ceased
to
be
true
the
unemployment
rate
for
women
was
in
august
the
lowest
since
if
you
ignore
the
in
april
of
this
year
but
the
record
set
in
was
substantially
lower
energy
became
number
in
the
world
independent
in
energy
trump
said
facts
first
these
are
separate
claims
and
they
are
both
false
the
us
became
the
world's
top
energy
producer
under
obama
not
trump
it
is
crude
oil
production
in
particular
in
which
it
took
the
number-one
spot
under
trump
and
the
us
has
not
yet
become
independent
in
energy
though
government
forecasters
predict
that
us
energy
exports
will
exceed
us
energy
imports
next
year
the
us
claimed
the
top
spot
on
energy
production
in
this
is
particularly
noteworthy
because
trump
has
accused
obama's
administration
of
perpetrating
a
cruel
war
on
american
energy
the
united
states
has
been
the
world's
top
producer
of
natural
gas
since
when
us
natural
gas
production
surpassed
that
of
russia
and
it
has
been
the
world's
top
producer
of
petroleum
hydrocarbons
since
when
its
production
exceeded
saudi
arabia's
the
energy
information
administration
says
the
us
is
close
to
energy
independence
according
to
one
common
definition
but
it
hasn't
happened
yet
the
us
is
expected
to
export
more
energy
than
it
imports
by
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
still
trump
is
stretching
when
he
claims
this
has
already
occurred
we
should
also
note
that
the
decrease
in
us
imports
and
increase
in
exports
began
before
the
trump
administration
obama
presided
over
a
boom
in
liquefied
natural
gas
exports
and
signed
a
bill
lifting
a
year-old
ban
on
crude
oil
exports
the
truth
is
that
both
of
the
presidents
of
this
decade
president
obama
and
president
trump
have
presided
over
an
incredibly
brisk
expansion
of
our
capacity
to
produce
oil
and
refined
products
executive
policy
has
had
little
to
do
with
the
explosive
gains
which
are
attributable
to
technology
and
price
said
tom
kloza
global
head
of
energy
analysis
for
the
oil
price
information
service
definitions
of
energy
independence
vary
even
if
us
exports
do
exceed
us
imports
the
us
will
still
of
course
be
using
a
substantial
quantity
of
resources
from
other
countries
judges
will
soon
have
record
number
of
judges
sc
justices
trump
said
facts
first
trump
might
indeed
break
the
record
if
he
gets
reelected
given
his
current
pace
but
it
would
almost
certainly
take
him
years
at
present
he
has
appointed
less
than
half
the
number
of
judges
ronald
reagan
did
over
reagan's
eight
years
according
to
data
from
russell
wheeler
a
brookings
institution
visiting
fellow
who
is
an
authority
on
judicial
confirmations
wheeler's
data
shows
that
reagan
got
judges
confirmed
to
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeal
bill
clinton
george
w.
bush
as
of
monday
it
was
for
trump
wheeler
says
reagan
clinton
and
bush
of
course
served
for
eight
years
to
trump's
less-than-three
so
far
so
we're
not
saying
trump
will
never
get
there
if
he
won
the
election
and
kept
up
his
current
pace
of
more
than
per
year
he
would
do
so
by
but
getting
there
over
a
number
of
additional
years
does
not
count
as
soon
by
any
reasonable
definition
trump
could
factually
make
a
more
narrow
boast
in
an
august
article
wheeler
noted
that
trump
had
seated
a
record
number
of
appeals
court
judges
through
that
point
in
his
presidency
leaving
his
predecessors
in
the
dust
but
wheeler
also
noted
that
trump
had
not
set
an
overall
record
when
you
include
district
courts
and
had
not
set
a
percentage
record
regardless
the
russia
investigation
done
more
than
any
president
in
first
years
despite
phony
fraudulent
witch
hunt
illegally
led
against
him
trump
said
facts
first
done
more
is
subjective
so
we'll
let
it
slide
but
there
is
no
evidence
the
investigation
into
the
trump
campaign's
relationship
with
russia
which
he
calls
a
witch
hunt
was
illegal
special
counsel
robert
mueller
was
appointed
by
a
republican
whom
trump
appointed
then-deputy
attorney
general
rod
rosenstein
trump
has
questioned
the
motives
and
tactics
of
mueller's
team
but
he
has
provided
no
evidence
of
illegality
treasonous
crimes
no
obstruction
no
collusion
only
treasonous
crimes
committed
by
the
other
side
and
led
by
the
democrats
trump
said
facts
first
mueller's
report
laid
out
multiple
cases
of
possible
obstruction
trump's
appointee
as
attorney
general
william
barr
concluded
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
establish
a
crime
was
committed
though
other
prominent
lawyers
disagreed
regardless
there
is
no
evidence
of
treasonous
crimes
by
the
other
side
whether
trump
means
mueller's
team
or
democrats
and
there
is
no
evidence
any
such
crimes
were
led
by
the
democrats
treasonous
can
be
read
at
least
slightly
softer
than
trump's
periodic
claim
that
people
involved
in
the
investigation
committed
actual
treason
still
he
is
baselessly
though
vaguely
suggesting
some
sort
of
treason
conspiracy
involving
democrats
former
obama
white
house
counsel
greg
craig
someone
who
can
be
said
to
be
on
the
other
side
was
charged
in
a
case
arising
from
the
mueller
investigation
but
he
was
acquitted
last
week
and
mueller
secured
convictions
from
multiple
people
from
trump's
own
orbit
former
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
former
deputy
chairman
rick
gates
former
campaign
foreign
policy
adviser
george
papadopoulos
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
and
former
lawyer
and
trump
organization
executive
michael
cohen
claims
that
need
more
context
total
employment
more
people
working
today
than
ever
before
trump
said
facts
first
this
is
true
but
trump
is
basically
taking
credit
for
the
population
growing
as
you
can
see
from
the
government's
official
chart
the
number
of
people
working
tends
to
rise
steadily
with
population
growth
the
military
and
veterans
rebuilt
military
choice
for
vets
trump
said
facts
first
it
is
debatable
how
much
trump
has
rebuilt
the
military
though
he
has
increased
military
spending
contrary
to
his
frequent
claims
trump
did
not
get
the
veterans
choice
health
program
passed
it
was
signed
into
law
by
obama
in
trump
did
sign
the
va
mission
act
in
which
expanded
and
modified
the
choice
program
this
was
a
more
grammatically
ambiguous
version
of
the
choice
claim
than
usual
so
we
won't
call
it
false
if
trump
was
claiming
that
he
rebuilt
choice
not
that
he
got
it
passed
himself
that
is
basically
true
the
va
mission
act
makes
substantial
changes
to
the
obama
version
of
the
program
allowing
a
greater
number
of
veterans
to
reimbursed
for
seeing
private
doctors
the
report
on
james
comey
win
on
mueller
report
mueller
testimony
james
comey
ig
report
which
showed
him
to
be
a
disgraced
dirty
cop
trump
said
facts
first
trump
can
fairly
claim
a
win
on
the
inspector
general's
report
on
comey
which
did
rebuke
comey
for
violating
fbi
policy
and
his
employment
agreement
when
he
retained
and
leaked
memos
he
wrote
about
his
interactions
with
trump
in
it's
worth
noting
though
that
the
inspector
general
found
that
a
frequent
trump
accusation
that
comey
had
leaked
classified
material
to
the
media
was
not
true
the
inspector
general
michael
horowitz
said
comey
set
a
dangerous
example
for
fbi
employees
in
an
attempt
to
achieve
a
personally
desired
outcome
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
this
lent
credence
to
trump's
accusations
that
comey
behaved
improperly
at
the
same
time
horowitz
rejected
one
of
trump's
favorite
charges
against
comey
finding
no
evidence
that
comey
or
his
attorneys
released
any
of
the
classified
information
contained
in
any
of
the
memos
to
members
of
the
media
