said
hell
yes
we're

the
former

congressman
said
during
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
hosted
by
abc
news
if
the
high-impact
high-velocity
round
when
it
hits
your
body
shreds
everything
inside
of
your
body
because
it
was
designed
to
do
that
so
that
you
would
bleed
to
death
on
a
battlefield
when
we
see
that
being
used
against
children
o'rourke
said
he
recalled
talking
to
a
woman
in
odessa
texas
who
had
watched
her
year-old
daughter
bleed
to
death
after
she
was
shot
by
a
man
wielding
an

late
last
month
o'rourke's
comments
come
in
the
wake
of
a
string
of
mass
shootings
in
the
united
states
including
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
where
people
were
gunned
down
at
a
walmart
in
august
o'rourke
unveiled
a
proposal
weeks
after
that
shooting
calling
for
a
national
gun
registry
a
nationwide
gun
licensing
system
and
the
mandatory
buyback
of
assault-style
rifles
as
part
of
his
plan
to
curb
gun
violence
and

republican
texas
state
rep
briscoe
cain
threatened
o'rourke
on
twitter
thursday
night
in
response
to
the
buyback
comments
tweeting
my
ar
is
ready
for
you
robert
francis
cain's
tweet
was
subsequently
removed
by
twitter
because
it
violated
the
company's
rules
against
violence
and
wishing
harm
against
others
a
twitter
spokesperson
told
cnn
o'rourke
was
quick
to
respond
over
the
same
social
media
platform
and
characterized
cain's
words
as
a
death
threat
o'rourke's
press
secretary
aleigha
cavalier
told
cnn's
leyla
santiago
that
the
campaign
was
reporting
the
tweet
to
the
fbi
any
time
you
have
somebody
threatening
to
use
violence
against
somebody
in
this
country
to
resolve
a
political
issue
really
for
any
reason
that's
a
matter
for
law
enforcement
o'rourke
told
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
representative
briscoe
cain
is
making
the
case
that
no
one
should
have
an
ar-
that
they
can
hold
over
someone
in
this
country
look
if
we
disagree
on
something
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
ar-
absolutely
wrong
in
twitter's
rules
on
safety
the
company
specifically
states
you
may
not
threaten
violence
against
an
individual
or
a
group
of
people
cain's
tweet
had
been
live
on
the
platform
for
more
than
two
hours
and
some
users
responded
to
the
tweet
saying
they
would
report
it
to
twitter
and
the
fbi
o'rourke
told
cnn's
dj
judd
early
friday
that
cain's
tweet
constituted
a
threat
yeah
it
sure
reads
like
one
to
me
and
i
think
it's
a
really
irresponsible
thing
for
him
to
do
especially
somebody
who
is
a
public
servant
and
in
a
position
of
public
trust
to
be
sending
that
kind
of
message
to
this
country
o'rourke
said
we
are
a
nation
of
laws
and
if
that
ends
up
becoming
the
law
of
the
united
states
of
america
then
we
expect
the
people
of
this
country
to
comply
with
it
cain
on
friday
told
cnn
that
his
words
were
not
a
true
threat
at
all
and
accused
o'rourke
of
spinning
his
tweet
into
a
death
threat
what
this
really
shows
is
how
how
dangerous
some
of
this
is
that
people
want
to
try
and
spin
somebody's
words
in
order
to
try
and
take
their
guns
away
cain
said
adding
that
fbi
has
not
reached
out
to
him
god
love
you
for
standing
in
the
middle
of
that
tragedy
o'rourke
did
recieve
praise
from
his
fellow
democratic
contenders
on
thursday
night
for
his
actions
following
the
shooting
in
el
paso
the
way
he
handled
what
happened
in
his
hometown
to
look
in
the
eyes
former
vice
president
joe
biden
said
fellow
texan
juli
n
castro
praised
o'rourke
for
how
well
he
has
spoken
to
the
passion
and
the
frustration
and
the
sadness
after
the
shooting
and
beto
god
love
you
for
standing
in
the
middle
of
that
tragedy
said
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
sen
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
said
i
so
appreciate
what
the
congressman's
been
doing
sen
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
needled
o'rourke
later
saying
he
was
sorry
it
had
taken
the
el
paso
shooting
for
o'rourke
to
embrace
the
position
booker
already
held
backing
a
mandatory
buyback
and
national
registration
o'rourke's
support
for
gun
licensing
is
a
reversal
from
may
when
he
was
asked
about
a
similar
proposal
from
booker
and
said
it
may
be
too
far
