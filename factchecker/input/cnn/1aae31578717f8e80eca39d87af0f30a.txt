o'rourke
allowing
the
nra
to
set
the
terms
of
the
debate
no
longer
works
washington
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
on
wednesday
reacted
to
criticism
of
his
proposed
mandatory
gun-buyback
program
for
assault-style
rifles
with
a
defiant
call
to
not
let
the
national
rifle
association
set
the
terms
of
the
debate
some
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
who
are
trying
to
find
a
way
forward
on
gun
legislation
that
republicans
and
democrats
have
been
critical
of
o'rourke's
proposal
and
rhetoric
around
guns
the
argument
is
that
his
comments
feed
into
long-held
conservative
talking
points
that
opening
the
door
to
any
changes
on
gun
laws
even
something
as
minor
as
expanding
background
checks
could
lead
democrats
to
eventually
force
people
to
give
up
their
guns
speaking
with
cnn's
chris
cuomo
on
prime
time
o'rourke
said
he
might
buy
that
argument
if
they
had
made
some
progress
already
many
of
those
democrats
are
complicit
in
what
we
see
right
now
i
mean
the
republicans
are
the
most
obstinate
and
the
most
obstructionist
and
the
most
in
the
pockets
of
the
nra
but
it's
been
a
bipartisan
problem
that
the
centers
for
disease
control
couldn't
even
study
gun
violence
that
here
we
are
in
and
we
still
don't
have
universal
background
checks
or
red
flag
laws
or
we
allowed
the
assault
weapons
ban
to
expire
even
though
it
did
so
much
good
and
saved
so
many
lives
he
said
so
this
old
policy
and
tactic
of
relying
on
polls
and
allowing
the
nra
to
set
the
terms
of
the
debate
no
longer
works
for
me
and
no
longer
works
for
this
country
o'rourke
said
he
added
that
the
american
people
are
there
for
gun
violence
legislation
and
now
that
urgency
just
needs
to
be
reflected
in
their
leadership
in
congress
it
will
be
reflected
when
i'm
in
the
white
house
o'rourke
has
made
gun
legislation
a
key
aspect
of
his
campaign
since
a
mass
shooting
at
a
walmart
in
his
hometown
of
el
paso
texas
left
dead
last
month
while
his
proposal
raises
a
number
of
legal
and
logistical
questions
o'rourke
said
wednesday
that
he
was
willing
to
fight
for
it
all
the
way
to
the
end
no
one
in
this
country
including
owners
of
ar-
s
and
ak-
s
think
that
what
is
happening
right
now
is
ok
he
said
earlier
this
month
o'rourke
told
cnn's
dana
bash
on
state
of
the
union
that
thoughts
and
prayers
have
done
nothing
to
curb
rampant
shootings
in
the
country
this
is
f
ed
up
he
said
