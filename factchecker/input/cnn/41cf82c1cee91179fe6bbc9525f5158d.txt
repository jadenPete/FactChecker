tells
donors
he
had
a
good
night
in
debate
but
could
have
done
better
biden
brushes
off
castro
attack
he's
got
his
facts
wrong
cnn
former
vice
president
joe
biden
said
friday
he'd
had
a
good
night
in
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
and
that
he
is
getting
more
comfortable
in
the
party's
primary
debates
though
he
sees
room
for
improvement
last
night
i
thought
was
a
good
night
he
said
at
a
houston
fundraiser
i
think
i
could
have
done
better
i
will
do
better
god
willing
biden
also
said
he
felt
that
he
faced
fewer
attacks
than
he'd
faced
in
the
party's
first
two
presidential
primary
debates
it
seems
like
most
people
have
stopped
criticizing
me
on
the
debate
stage
given
what
happens
to
them
biden
said
according
to
a
video
clip
a
donor
who
was
in
the
room
provided
to
cnn
the
donor
said
the
crowd
broke
out
in
laughter
the
democratic
party
has
an
obligation
bigger
than
to
itself
now
this
is
about
more
than
democrats
biden
told
supporters
according
to
the
video
clip
the
party
has
to
be
bigger
than
its
own
interests
we
have
to
unite
the
country
because
we're
in
a
position
if
we
don't
no
one
else
is
going
to
fill
the
world
vacuum
if
we
do
we
can
make
changes
that
are
going
to
be
breathtaking
biden
struck
the
upbeat
tone
the
day
after
the
leading
democratic
presidential
candidates
debated
at
texas
southern
university
it
was
the
first
time
biden
had
shared
the
stage
with
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
and
he
clashed
with
warren
and
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
on
health
care
repeatedly
pressing
his
two
progressive
foes
on
how
they
would
pay
for
their
favored
proposal
medicare
for
all
as
he
argued
for
a
more
limited
plan
that
would
build
on
obamacare
biden
also
tussled
with
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
juli
n
castro
a
low-polling
contender
who
went
on
the
attack
at
one
time
making
a
thinly
veiled
swipe
at
biden's
age
by
questioning
whether
he'd
forgotten
what
he'd
just
said
minutes
earlier
on
friday
biden's
campaign
said
in
an
email
to
supporters
that
castro
had
taken
a
cheap
shot
at
the
former
vice
president
biden
didn't
repeat
that
criticism
himself
instead
telling
reporters
that
castro
got
his
facts
wrong
i
mean
look
look
last
night
was
the
closest
we
came
to
a
debate
ok
biden
said
we
actually
had
an
open
debate
on
health
care
and
i
felt
very
good
about
the
debate
on
health
care
what
i
saw
last
night
was
fewer
personal
attacks
he
said
adding
that
he
is
getting
more
and
more
comfortable
with
the
way
the
debates
are
moving
