dire
warnings
about
election
integrity
to
democratic
hopefuls
is
the
u.s.
prepared
for
a
cyberattack
washington
cnn
hillary
clinton
said
tuesday
she
has
spoken
with
many
of
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
and
warned
them
about
voter
suppression
and
hacking
which
she
has
blamed
for
her
election
loss
to
donald
trump
clinton
has
previously
cited
those
factors
and
others
especially
then-fbi
director
james
comey's
decision
in
late
october
to
send
a
letter
to
congress
about
her
email
controversy
as
reasons
for
her
defeat
but
tuesday's
speech
at
george
washington
university
indicates
she
is
hoping
to
pass
some
of
those
lessons
onto
hopefuls
you
can
run
the
best
campaign
you
can
have
the
best
plans
you
can
get
the
nomination
you
can
win
the
popular
vote
and
you
can
lose
the
electoral
college
and
therefore
the
election
said
clinton
who
beat
trump
in
the
popular
vote
by
nearly
million
ballots
she
specifically
pointed
to
stacey
abrams
loss
in
last
year's
georgia
gubernatorial
election
in
which
her
opponent
brian
kemp
was
accused
of
suppressing
minority
votes
which
he
denied
and
referenced
republican-led
efforts
to
pass
restrictive
voting
measures
ostensibly
intended
to
prevent
voter
fraud
in
the
weeks
leading
up
to
the
election
wikileaks
began
releasing
emails
stolen
from
the
personal
account
of
clinton
campaign
chairman
john
podesta
who
was
spammed
with
a
link
that
appeared
to
come
from
google
as
a
security
notification
but
led
podesta
to
a
gru-created
website
wikileaks
got
the
emails
from
russian
hackers
clinton
indirectly
referred
to
that
effort
as
she
discussed
on
tuesday
her
warnings
to
democrats
i
tell
every
candidate
if
you
have
not
had
your
personal
and
campaign
emails
hacked
they
will
be
clinton
said
so
will
the
emails
of
people
working
for
you
your
information
will
be
stolen
and
then
weaponized
against
you
in
the
most
pernicious
ways
she
insisted
there
was
a
need
for
cybersecurity
that
she
said
doesn't
exist
in
the
us
today
and
there
was
no
real
effort
being
made
for
a
system
that
will
protect
voters
in
april
cnn
reported
that
department
of
homeland
security
officials
and
senior
leaders
have
had
difficulty
getting
the
white
house
to
pay
attention
to
threats
of
russian
election
interference
cybersecurity
is
an
essential
component
of
protecting
our
democracy
but
it's
very
difficult
for
campaigns
on
their
own
to
do
that
you
need
a
national
commitment
to
cybersecurity
clinton
said
she
also
expressed
her
concern
for
phony
false
online
news
stories
and
lack
of
election
security
saying
those
fighting
to
protect
american
elections
can't
be
deterred
by
ridicule
or
by
undermining
of
what
we
know
has
to
be
done
to
preserve
our
democracy
warner
calls
for
democratic
anti-hacking
pledge
speaking
at
a
separate
event
tuesday
at
the
federal
election
commission
about
disinformation
ahead
of
the
election
sen
mark
warner
of
virginia
said
it
was
remarkable
that
democratic
presidential
primary
candidates
had
not
all
signed
a
common
pledge
against
the
use
of
malicious
online
tactics
in
campaigning
warner
is
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
committee
which
investigated
russian
interference
in
the
election
while
some
democratic
candidates
have
pledged
not
to
use
hacked
material
from
foreign
adversaries
and
not
to
use
certain
malicious
online
tactics
like
bots
and
trolls
there
is
no
partywide
agreement
last
spring
the
chairs
of
democratic
parties
in
some
early-voting
states
called
for
all
candidates
to
come
to
agreement
on
the
issue
the
democratic
national
committee
asked
the
republican
national
committee
earlier
this
year
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
the
weaponization
of
stolen
private
data
in
our
electoral
process
the
rnc
did
not
commit
to
the
pledge
but
called
for
efforts
to
safeguard
our
future
elections
asked
in
june
whether
he
would
accept
dirt
on
political
rivals
from
foreign
governments
trump
said
there
isn't
anything
wrong
with
listening
and
that
he
wouldn't
necessarily
report
the
contact
to
the
fbi
it's
a
crime
for
a
campaign
to
knowingly
solicit
or
accept
items
of
value
from
foreign
nationals
