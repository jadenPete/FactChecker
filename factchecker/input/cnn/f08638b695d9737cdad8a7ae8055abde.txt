i
have
no
obligation
to
be
honest
to
media
cnn
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
said
he
has
no
obligation
to
tell
the
truth
to
the
media
while
acknowledging
that
he
had
not
told
the
truth
when
asked
earlier
this
year
about
his
interactions
with
president
donald
trump
during
congressional
testimony
on
tuesday
lewandowski
a
former
cnn
political
commentator
acknowledged
that
perhaps
i
was
inaccurate
during
a
february
interview
on
msnbc
in
that
interview
lewandowski
said
he
did
not
remember
the
president
ever
asking
him
to
get
involved
with
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
or
the
department
of
justice
which
differs
from
what
he
told
special
counsel
robert
mueller
mueller's
report
stated
that
lewandowski
said
that
in
june
trump
instructed
him
to
tell
sessions
to
curtail
the
mueller
investigation
and
that
lewandowski
did
not
follow
through
while
being
questioned
by
barry
berke
a
lawyer
for
the
democrats
on
the
house
judiciary
committee
lewandowski
was
shown
a
video
of
the
interview
he
said
the
clip
can
be
interpreted
any
way
you'd
like
i
have
no
obligation
to
be
honest
with
the
media
he
told
the
panel
it
is
not
a
crime
to
lie
on
television
but
it
is
illegal
to
lie
or
omit
information
during
an
interview
with
federal
agents
as
part
of
a
criminal
investigation
lewandowski
sought
to
clarify
that
he
had
not
lied
to
mueller's
investigators
so
you're
admitting
that
on
national
television
you
were
lying
there
berke
asked
what
i'm
saying
is
they
have
been
inaccurate
on
many
occasions
and
perhaps
i
was
inaccurate
that
time
lewandowski
replied
lewandowski
also
said
he
is
a
truth
teller
whenever
he
stands
before
congress
or
takes
an
oath
asked
about
the
exchange
during
an
interview
on
wednesday
with
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
lewandowski
said
i'm
as
honest
as
i
can
be
as
often
as
i
can
be
several
major
players
in
trump's
orbit
have
been
caught
lying
to
investigators
and
faced
criminal
charges

former
trump
campaign
