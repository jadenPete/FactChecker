the
campaign
let
go
of
its
political
director
in
iowa
jess
mazour
earlier
this
summer
said
misty
rebik
sanders
state
director
rebik
will
remain
in
her
position
we'll
continue
to
make
moves
that
we
feel
best
position
this
campaign
to
win
campaign
manager
faiz
shakir
said
on
wednesday
night
the
washington
post
first
reported
on
the
move
word
of
mazour's
departure
follows
the
reassignment
earlier
this
week
of
former
new
hampshire
state
director
joe
caiazzo
who
was
replaced
there
with
shannon
jackson
a
close
sanders
aide
who
managed
his
senate
race
caiazzo
is
taking
over
operations
in
massachusetts
which
votes
next
march
on
super
tuesday
a
month
after
the
iowa
caucuses
the
staff
shuffling
comes
as
the
sanders
campaign
jockeys
for
position
with
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
whose
rise
in
the
polls
over
the
past
few
months
has
put
her
about
even
with
the
vermont
independent
as
they
work
to
chase
down
former
vice
president
joe
biden
despite
the
changes
the
sanders
campaign
has
been
publicly
bullish
about
its
operations
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
where
the
senator
scored
his
first
victory
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
we've
got
new
hampshire
in
a
very
strong
place
there's
still
work
to
do
to
win
the
state
for
damn
sure
but
we
have
it
in
a
place
that
we
feel
very
good
about
shakir
told
cnn
earlier
this
week
shakir
also
played
up
the
importance
of
massachusetts
and
though
he
didn't
mention
her
by
name
conceded
that
warren's
presence
in
the
race
meant
they
expected
an
especially
tight
contest
in
the
bay
state
massachusetts
is
a
challenge
because
there
is
another
presidential
candidate
running
who
is
from
massachusetts
shakir
said
so
it
takes
a
particular
savvy
to
win
that
state
and
i
feel
very
strongly
that
joe
caiazzo
is
that
person
