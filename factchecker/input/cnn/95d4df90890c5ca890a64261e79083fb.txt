andrew
yang
is
the
hottest
candidate
this
side
of
elizabeth
warren
right
now
cnn
a
viral
crowd
surfing
video
a
massive
and
growing
online
support
network
steady
polling
progress
and
a
promise
of
something
big
in
store
for
thursday
night's
democratic
presidential
debate
the
current
reality
of
the
presidential
race
is
this
aside
from
elizabeth
warren
and
her
surge
into
second
place
behind
joe
biden
there
is
no
candidate
with
more
momentum
and
buzz
than
andrew
yang
headed
into
tonight's
third
debate
which
is
if
you
stop
and
think
about
things
for
seconds
a
pretty
remarkable
statement
yang
started
the
presidential
race
as
a
total
and
complete
unknown
having
never
run
for
elected
office
ever
before
he
was
polling
at
because
well
he
was
a
total
and
complete
unknown
his
platform
focused
on
the
dangers
posed
by
our
rapidly
automating
society
was
different
than
what
any
of
the
other
candidates
were
talking
about
his
central
idea
to
offer
a
universal
basic
income
to
every
person
or
older
in
the
country
was
dismissed
as
unworkable
and
crazy
and
yet
yang
will
be
one
of
the
candidates
on
stage
in
houston
for
the
third
debate
of
the
democratic
primary
he
has
outlasted
much
more
established
political
figures
like
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
new
york
gov
jay
inslee
washington
and
former
colorado
gov
john
hickenlooper
all
of
whom
have
left
the
race
amid
fundraising
problems
and
disappointing
poll
numbers
and
at
least
at
the
moment
yang
finds
himself
firmly
in
the
second
tier
with
sen
kamala
harris
calif
and
south
bend
mayor
pete
buttigieg
indiana
slightly
above
bigger
names
in
politics
at
least
like
beto
o'rourke
and
cory
booker
how
good
question
without
an
easy
and
obvious
answer
i
do
though
have
a
few
theories
yang
is
an
outsider
at
a
time
when
voters
want
outsiders
yang
seems
like
a
normal
person
who
doesn't
take
himself
too
seriously
in
the
last
hours
he's
tweeted
about
the
dumbness
of
scheduling
a
debate
on
the
same
night
as
an
nfl
game
and
posted
a
video
of
himself
shooting
hoops
and
dunking
as
a
way
to
warm
up
for
the
houston
debate
yang
explicitly
ran
his
campaign
online
understanding
that
the
power
of
the
internet
was
the
only
way
in
the
early
days
of
his
campaign
for
someone
with
a
profile
like
his
to
raise
money
and
organize
he
has
also
from
the
start
of
the
campaign
cast
it
as
a
team
effort
he
is
the
face
of
the
movement
sure
but
he
is
not
the
movement
is
andrew
yang
being
unfairly
ignored
he's
talking
about
an
issue
automation
and
what
it
means
to
who
we
are
and
how
we
work
and
live
that
feels
fresh
relevant
and
most
importantly
different
than
the
same
boilerplate
stuff
voters
are
getting
from
other
candidates
polling
below
yang
regardless
of
the
reason
s
yang
has
struck
a
chord
at
least
among
some
segment
of
the
democratic
primary
electorate
in
the
last
six
polls
on
the
race
as
collected
by
real
clear
politics
yang's
support
ranges
from
to
which
isn't
great
except
when
you
consider
that
those
numbers
are
more
than
of
the
other
democrats
still
running
for
president
to
be
clear
andrew
yang
is
still
a
long
shot
the
most
likely
outcome
is
that
he
has
hit
his
ceiling
and
will
go
no
higher
but
no
one
including
me
thought
that
yang
would
even
get
to
this
point
which
means
that
predictions
about
where
he
will
go
from
here
seem
like
a
fool's
errand
and
if
donald
trump's
victory
in
taught
the
political
class
anything
it's
this
never
ever
say
never
