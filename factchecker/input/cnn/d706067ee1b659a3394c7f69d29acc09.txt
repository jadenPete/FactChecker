the

said
during

vegas
acknowledging
that
it
is
expensive
sanders
said
he
will
call
for
a
national
rent
control
standard
capping
annual
rent
increases
throughout
the
country
at
no
more
than
one
and
a
half
times
the
rate
of
inflation
or
three
percent
whichever
is
higher
he
said
sanders
did
not
offer
specifics
on
how
he
would
pay
for
the
plan
aside
from
raising
taxes
on
the
top
one-tenth
of
one
percent
of
american
households
he
stressed
that
under
his
housing
proposal
percent
of
americans
will
not
see
their
taxes
go
up
by
one
nickel
he
noted
that
his
late
mother's
dream
that
their
family
would
move
out
of
their
rent-controlled
brooklyn
apartment
and
into
their
own
home
never
happened
but
during
her
life
at
least
our
family
was
always
able
to
afford
a
roof
over
our
heads
because
we
were
living
in
a
rent-controlled
building
which
meant
that
for
our
family
and
all
the
other
families
in
our
building
rents
could
not
be
arbitrarily
raised
he
said
sanders
also
announced
that
he
will
expand
the
national
affordable
housing
trust
fund
and
create
an
additional
two
million
units
of
mixed-income
housing
which
he
said
would
create
many
many
good-paying
union
jobs
warren
and
sanders
say
americans
don't
like
their
health
insurance
polls
don't
back
that
up
he
would
fully
fund
the
section
rental
assistance
program
and
establish
anti-discrimination
protections
for
program
recipients
against

invest
more
than

over
the
next
five
years
to
address
homelessness

repair
and
grow

the
construction
of
