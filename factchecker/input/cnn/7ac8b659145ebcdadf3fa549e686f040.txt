kamala
harris
rode
the
kavanaugh
wave
once
can
she
do
it
again
cnn
simmering
anger
in
the
democratic
party
over
the
handling
of
brett
kavanaugh's
supreme
court
confirmation
hearing
has
suddenly
roared
back
to
life
amid
new
details
about
sexual
misconduct
allegations
against
the
justice
and
for
sen
kamala
harris
who
built
her
national
profile
in
the
contentious
hearing
it
has
provided
a
fresh
opportunity
for
her
to
potentially
rekindle
the
fire
in
her
campaign
no
presidential
contender
benefited
more
from
the
fury
in
the
base
over
kavanaugh's
nomination
than
harris
who
used
the
hearing
to
combatively
and
directly
question
the
future
supreme
court
justice
those
moments
proved
to
be
a
fundraising
and
digital
juggernaut
in
and
with
the
resurgence
of
the
issue
her
campaign
is
moving
to
take
advantage
of
a
similar
level
of
intensity
and
financial
support
in
order
to
boost
her
presidential
campaign
kavanaugh's
hearings
were
an
inflection
point
for
multiple
democratic
contenders
including
sens
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
and
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
all
members
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
they
each
questioned
kavanaugh
which
provided
them
with
a
high-profile
launching
point
for
their
soon-to-be-realized
presidential
campaigns
sensing
an
opening
in
the
crowded
primary
harris
became
one
of
the
first
democratic
candidates
to
publicly
call
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
in
the
wake
of
recent
allegations
brett
kavanaugh
lied
to
the
u.s.
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
she
tweeted
on
sunday
morning
after
the
new
york
times
published
excerpts
of
a
new
book
containing
details
about
the
allegations
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
on
tuesday
she
also
urged
the
house
judiciary
committee
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
kavanaugh
we
must
protect
the
integrity
of
our
justice
system
and
it
is
imperative
that
we
pursue
a
legitimate
search
for
truth
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
people
she
wrote
in
a
letter
to
committee
chairman
jerry
nadler
while
booker
has
joined
harris
tweeting
that
he
stands
with
survivors
and
countless
other
americans
in
calling
for
impeachment
proceedings
to
begin
klobuchar
has
been
far
more
reserved
asking
for
more
investigation
but
falling
short
of
impeachment
on
monday
klobuchar
sent
a
letter
to
attorney
general
william
barr
requesting
additional
information
about
the
investigation
into
kavanaugh's
past
the
book
excerpt
published
in
the
new
york
times
has
come
under
fire
after
the
paper
issued
an
update
to
the
piece
clarifying
that
the
alleged
victim
does
not
recall
the
incident
involving
kavanaugh
that
was
described
by
others
through
a
court
spokeswoman
kavanaugh
declined
to
comment
harris
answered
those
critics
telling
npr
that
the
fact
that
someone
does
not
remember
the
details
of
that
incident
doesn't
mean
that
there's
a
lack
of
evidence
if
there
are
other
witnesses
who
can
establish
that
the
fact
occurred

harris
gambit
is
one
that
is
not
without
risks
but
for
harris
who
rode
on
a
wave
of
enthusiasm
and
fundraising
spawned
by
her
questioning
of
kavanaugh
during
last
year's
hearing
it
may
be
worth
it
with
her
standing
in
the
presidential
race
largely
stagnant
this
latest
push
serves
as
a
reminder
to
democrats
of
a
major
reason
to
back
her
candidacy
and
it
could
provide
a
much-needed
boost
in
enthusiasm
as
the
race
enters
the
critical
fall
period
and
ahead
of
the
third
quarter
fundraising
deadline
to
the
extent
that
she's
presenting
herself
as
the
person
most
capable
of
taking
the
fight
to
trump
the
kavanaugh
experience
proved
that
she
has
the
mettle
to
be
aggressive
and
not
back
down
to
republicans
said
brian
fallon
executive
director
of
demand
justice
a
left-leaning
non-profit
that
aims
to
increase
the
number
of
democratic
appointees
on
the
federal
bench
the
person
that
rose
to
the
occasion
was
harris
and
responding
to
the
focus
on
kavanaugh
also
links
back
to
what
harris
hears
from
voters
at
events
across
the
country
voters
often
tell
harris
that
they
were
drawn
to
her
after
questioning
of
the
soon-to-be
supreme
court
justice
they
remember
the
way
that
she
stood
up
for
christine
blasey
ford
and
looked
her
in
the
eye
and
said
you're
not
on
trial
here
ian
sams
harris's
national
press
secretary
said
this
is
one
of
the
biggest
fights
that
she
had
in
the
senate
she's
standing
up
and
saying
this
fight
isn't
over
sams
said
before
she
was
officially
a
candidate
for
president
the
kavanaugh
hearing
catapulted
harris
from
freshman
senator
to
a
national
name
who
was
on
the
frontlines
of
her
party's
effort
to
push
back
on
kavanaugh's
nomination
her
staff
channeled
the
intense
engagement
online
on
this
issue
into
scores
of
new
supporters
and
donors
that
later
helped
power
her
run
for
president
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
harris
online
anti-kavanaugh
petition
drew
more
than
million
signatures
the
source
confirmed
a
massive
level
of
engagement
even
before
she
announced
her
presidential
candidacy
harris
also
used
the
intensity
of
democrats
support
for
her
activism
on
kavanaugh
to
raise
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
other
candidates
on
the
day
that
then-sen
heidi
heitkamp
announced
that
she
would
not
support
kavanaugh's
nomination
harris
raised
more
than
in
online
donations
for
heitkamp's
intensely
contested
senate
race
that
figure
was
the
largest
amount
harris
has
ever
raised
for
another
candidate
the
source
said
heitkamp
would
lose
to
republican
kevin
cramer
takeaways
from
the
new
book
about
brett
kavanaugh
but
as
a
presidential
candidate
harris
campaign
is
somewhat
hamstrung
by
senate
ethics
rules
which
do
not
allow
her
political
campaign
to
use
footage
of
harris
recorded
inside
the
us
capitol
building
during
the
course
of
her
presidential
run
her
aides
have
referenced
these
moments
in
social
media
posts
but
have
not
been
able
to
use
the
video
itself
to
remind
democrats
about
harris
performance
in
the
hearings
still
that
hasn't
stopped
the
campaign
from
working
to
channel
the
same
energy
she
experienced
last
year
into
one
that
can
boost
her
presidential
bid
now
after
harris
sent
her
tweet
calling
for
kavanaugh
to
be
impeached
her
campaign
blasted
out
another
email
asking
for
signatures
on
a
petition
people
who
followed
the
link
would
then
be
pushed
to
donate
to
the
campaign
the
campaign
sent
out
two
such
emails
on
sunday
additionally
harris
has
used
her
media
appearances
to
push
the
issue
it
was
a
sham
harris
said
of
the
kavanaugh
investigation
in
an
interview
on
msnbc
on
monday
night
and
yes
i've
called
for
impeachment
i
believe
that
is
the
clearest
way
for
us
to
get
an
investigation
of
these
allegations
and
on
monday
her
campaign
sent
out
an
explicit
fundraising
pitch
to
voters
from
day
one
kamala
has
been
a
leader
in
the
fight
against
brett
kavanaugh's
illegitimate
nomination
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
trump-mcconnell
right-wing
takeover
of
our
judicial
system
the
emails
said
sams
said
that
harris
impeachment
tweet
is
one
of
the
most
retweeted
ever
sent
by
the
campaign
contrasting
methods
harris
focus
on
the
kavanaugh
allegations
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
klobuchar's
more
careful
response
to
the
recent
revival
of
allegations
where
harris
has
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
klobuchar
while
not
ruling
it
out
did
not
outright
call
for
it
i
strongly
oppose
him
based
on
his
views
on
the
executive
power
which
will
continue
to
haunt
our
country
as
well
as
how
he
behaved
including
the
allegations
that
we
are
hearing
more
about
today
she
told
abc
on
sunday
my
concern
here
is
that
the
process
was
a
sham
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
impeachment
hearings
without
getting
the
documents
and
the
attorney
general
is
shielding
documents
klobuchar
also
tweeted
a
photo
of
christine
blasey
ford
one
of
kavanaugh's
primary
accusers
being
sworn
into
her
hearing
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
let
us
never
forget
what
courage
looks
like
she
wrote
senator
urged
fbi
to
reach
out
to
kavanaugh
witness
letter
shows
that
is
all
however
klobuchar
has
said
so
far
about
the
matter
despite
the
fact
that
much
like
harris
she
hears
about
the
kavanaugh
hearings
often
from
voters
many
of
whom
tell
her
that
they
learned
about
her
from
those
tv
moments
klobuchar's
campaign
has
not
sent
out
any
fundraising
about
kavanaugh
and
her
top
aides
were
reticent
to
talk
about
it
on
monday
compare
that
to
harris
who
in
an
interview
with
npr
on
monday
harris
disputed
that
her
early
position
on
kavanaugh's
impeachment
was
political
opportunism
you
know
i
thought
about
that
before
i
publicly
called
for
impeachment
this
is
an
issue
that
i've
been
working
on
for
over
a
year
harris
said
i
feel
very
strongly
about
this
case
and
so
i'm
willing
to
take
the
hit
i
agree
that
some
would
say
politically
motivated
while
the
kavanaugh
issue
might
have
mobilized
democrats
ahead
of
the
election
republicans
argue
it
energized
the
conservative
base
as
well
many
of
whom
were
infuriated
by
kavanaugh's
treatment
during
the
hearing
the
issue
which
took
place
just
months
before
election
day
further
imperiled
democratic
senators
in
red
states
costing
some
of
them
including
heitkamp
their
jobs
republicans
like
to
point
to
how
they
think
it
played
in
north
dakota
but
geographically
there's
more
places
like
abigail
spanberger's
district
in
suburban
virginia
where
kavanaugh
was
a
net
negative
for
republicans
fallon
said
it
galvanizes
both
sides
bases
but
i
think
the
swing
voters
in
the
election
are
going
to
be
women
in
the
suburbs
