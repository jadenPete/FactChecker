the

office
of
special
counsel
announced
tuesday
an
immigration
judge
has
been
disciplined
for
violating
the
hatch
act
from
the
bench
at
a
deportation
hearing
by
promoting
then-presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton's
plan
for
immigration
reform
carmene
depaolo
who
was
formerly
employed
by
the
us
department
of
justice
and
has
since
retired
has
been
fined
the
maximum
civil
penalty
of
and
faces
a
month
debarment
from
federal
service
the
disciplinary
action
was
imposed
by
an
administrative
law
judge
on
behalf
of
the
merit
systems
protection
board
for
violating
the
hatch
act
which
limits
certain
political
activities
of
federal
employees
at
an
immigration
hearing
in
march
over
which
depaolo
presided
an
individual
was
facing
deportation
and
a
year
bar
on
reentry
into
the
united
states
which
depaolo
called
a
pretty
harsh
thing
according
to
the
osc
in
a
hearing
that
was
open
to
the
public
she
said
clinton
intended
to
change
that
policy
provided
the
senate
becomes
a
democratic
body
and
there's
some
hope
that
they
can
actually
pass
immigration
legislation
depaolo
said
in
the
hearing
that
republicans
aren't
going
to
do
anything
about
immigration
if
they
can
help
it
other
than
to
try
to
deport
everybody
according
to
the
osc
cnn
has
reached
out
to
depaolo
for
comment
what
is
the
hatch
act
the
hatch
act
is
intended
to
stop
the
federal
government
from
influencing
elections
or
carrying
out
its
activities
in
a
partisan
manner
and
according
to
the
osc's
own
explanation
of
the
rule
it
applies
to
federal
employees
as
well
as
state
and
local
employees
who
work
with
federally
funded
programs
the
rule
is
a
workplace
guideline
and
violating
it
is
not
a
crime
responses
can
vary
significantly
if
employees
violate
the
rule
the
decision
states
depaolo's
action
politicizes
the
judiciary
and
raises
the
specter
that
this
nation's
courtrooms
are
partisan
and
that
judges
consider
political
platforms
when
advising
litigants
this
conduct
sends
a
bad
message
to
subordinates
the
decision
states
and
possibly
instils
the
notion
that
political
activity
is
allowed
at
work
if
a
judge
can
say
it
from
the
bench
what
stops
other
employees
from
making
these
statements
in
the
office
in
june
osc
filed
a
complaint
charging
depaolo
with
violating
the
hatch
act
the
office
of
special
counsel
is
an
independent
agency
and
is
not
related
to
the
special
counsel
investigation
that
was
led
by
robert
mueller
