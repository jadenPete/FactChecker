a
lion
trophy
from
tanzania
has
been
approved
for
import
to
the
us
the
first
such
case
since
lions
began
receiving
protections
in
january
as
a
threatened
species
under
the
endangered
species
act
a
conservation
group
says
documents
obtained
by
the
center
for
biological
diversity
via
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
and
shared
with
cnn
on
thursday
show
the
hunter
carl
atkinson
was
represented
by
lawyer
john
jackson
iii
a
member
of
the
interior
department's
own
international
wildlife
conservation
council
a
controversial
panel
convened
to
advise
on
how
trophy
hunting
helps
conservation
the
group
also
says
the
findings
in
the
documents
suggest
the
trump
administration
is
preparing
to
approve
the
importation
of
other
species
such
as
elephants
from
tanzania
according
to
the
documents
the
trophy
which
was
approved
for
import
to
the
us
between
july
and
august
cannot
be
sold
within
the
us
jackson
told
cnn
that
atkinson
wanted
to
bring
back
the
trophy
because
it
is
key
to
hunters
to
memorialize
the
experience
it
is
unethical
to
waste
any
part
of
the
hunt
or
to
leave
behind
any
part
he
said
jackson
said
his
client
paid
for
the
day
safari
the
documents
show
atkinson
initially
submitted
his
application
in
november
for
the
importation
of
a
sport-hunted
trophy
between
july
and
august
of
this
year
the
trump
administration
had
previously
signaled
an
openness
to
allowing
some
big
game
trophy
imports
on
a
case-by-case
basis
deciding
an
issue
that
split
president
donald
trump
and
his
interior
department
in
the
decision
to
allow
some
imports
came
after
public
backlash
to
the
rollback
of
obama-era
restrictions
on
importing
trophies
of
elephants
and
lions
from
some
african
countries
by
the
interior
department's
fish
and
wildlife
service
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
said
in
a
statement
that
it
is
making
findings
for
trophy
imports
on
an
application-by-application
basis
legal
well-regulated
hunting
as
part
of
a
sound
management
program
can
benefit
the
conservation
of
certain
species
by
providing
incentives
to
local
communities
to
conserve
the
species
and
by
putting
much-needed
revenue
back
into
conservation
the
statement
read
in
response
to
a
d.c.
circuit
court
opinion
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
service
has
revised
its
procedure
for
assessing
applications
to
import
certain
hunted
species
we
have
withdrawn
our
countrywide
enhancement
findings
for
a
range
of
species
across
several
countries
in
their
place
the
service
is
making
findings
for
trophy
imports
on
an
application-by-application
basis
tanya
sanerib
the
international
legal
director
for
the
center
told
cnn
that
the
approval
is
tragic
news
for
lion
conservation
and
it
suggests
that
the
trump
administration
may
soon
open
the
floodgates
to
trophy
imports
from
tanzania
tanzania
is
a
lion
stronghold
but
it's
been
criticized
by
scientists
for
corruption
and
inadequate
wildlife
protections
opening
the
us
market
to
these
imports
doesn't
bode
well
for
the
lion
kings
of
tanzania
she
added
last
week
an
american
hunter
faced
backlash
after
he
was
granted
a
permit
to
import
a
black
rhino
he
killed
in
namibia
as
part
of
a
hunting
trip
the
hunter
was
represented
by
jackson
the
attorney
believes
his
group
conservation
force
is
ultimately
doing
more
to
protect
animals
claiming
hunting
promotes
healthy
populations
in
the
wild
i'm
working
to
save
wildlife
from
animal
protectionists
jackson
said
recently
of
his
efforts
