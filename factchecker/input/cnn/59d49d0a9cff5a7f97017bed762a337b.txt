trump
now
says
not
all
vaping
is
bad
cnn
president
donald
trump
seemed
to
strike
a
different
tone
on
vaping
in
a
tweet
friday
evening
after
announcing
earlier
in
the
week
an
effort
to
ban
almost
all
flavored
vaping
products
while
i
like
the
vaping
alternative
to
cigarettes
we
need
to
make
sure
this
alternative
is
safe
for
all
the
president
tweeted
let's
get
counterfeits
off
the
market
and
keep
young
children
from
vaping
he
added
the
first
time
he
has
mentioned
counterfeit
products
the
tweet
represents
another
instance
of
the
president
stepping
back
from
a
firm
policy
stance
as
evidenced
recently
by
his
maneuvering
on
gun
control
policy
in
that
instance
trump
initially
vowed
action
on
background
checks
following
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
but
then
softened
his
support
for
new
policies
following
conversations
with
the
national
rifle
association
and
eventually
receded
into
vague
statements
about
next
steps
a
similar
trend
could
be
starting
to
play
out
regarding
vaping
which
trump
came
out
strongly
against
earlier
this
week
the
president
said
wednesday
that
the
us
food
and
drug
administration
would
be
putting
out
some
very
strong
recommendations
regarding
the
use
of
flavored
e-cigarettes
in
a
couple
of
weeks
health
and
human
services
secretary
alex
azar
seated
in
the
oval
office
with
the
president
first
lady
melania
trump
and
the
acting
commissioner
of
the
fda
announced
that
newly
proposed
enforcement
policy
would
require
flavored
e-cigarette
companies
to
take
their
products
off
the
market
it'll
take
several
weeks
for
us
to
put
out
the
final
guidance
that
will
announce
all
the
parameters
around
the
enforcement
policy
and
then
there
will
likely
be
about
a
day
delay
to
effective
date
as
is
customary
azar
said
but
at
that
point
all
flavored
e-cigarettes
other
than
tobacco
flavor
would
have
to
be
removed
from
the
market
the
secretary
said
by
may
he
said
e-cigarette
companies
making
tobacco-flavored
products
would
have
the
chance
to
file
for
approval
by
the
fda
at
that
time
flavored-product
manufacturers
would
also
have
the
opportunity
to
file
but
their
products
would
be
off
the
market
until
approved
it's
unclear
what
effect
trump's
friday
shift
could
play
on
those
plans
given
that
counterfeit
products
were
not
mentioned
during
that
oval
office
briefing
the
first
lady
whose
be
best
platform
focuses
in
part
on
children's
health
and
combating
addiction
has
spoken
out
more
than
once
over
her
concerns
about
e-cigarette
use
by
children
trump
when
asked
on
thursday
by
reporters
if
he
and
the
first
lady
had
discussed
vaping
with
their
year-old
son
barron
said
we
haven't
told
him
anything
except
don't
vape
don't
vape
we
don't
like
vaping
i
don't
like
vaping
two
former
administration
officials
departed
the
white
house
to
work
for
juul
a
popular
electronic
cigarette
company
a
third
works
with
the
company
as
a
consultant
on
thursday
evening
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
updated
the
way
it
is
reporting
case
counts
across
the
united
states
the
agency
says
it
is
now
aware
of
confirmed
and
probable
cases
of
lung
disease
associate
with
e-cigarette
use
across
states
it
is
no
longer
reporting
possible
cases
or
cases
under
investigation
