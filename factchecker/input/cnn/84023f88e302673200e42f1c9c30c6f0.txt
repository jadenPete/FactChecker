nascar
shocks
gun
industry
as
it
appears
to
block
some
firearm
ads
washington
cnn
nascar
rejected
advertisements
for
its
souvenir
programs
from
multiple
firearms
companies
earlier
this
summer
as
part
of
what
is
being
seen
as
a
gradual
shift
in
its
position
on
guns
the
move
may
be
another
example
of
how
major
companies
are
adjusting
as
the
nation
grapples
with
guns
in
america
while
the
move
did
not
get
widespread
notice
nascar's
apparent
shift
stunned
gun
enthusiasts
who
said
there
is
a
large
overlap
between
nascar
fans
and
gun
owners
and
left
some
in
the
firearms
industry
questioning
why
nascar's
viewpoint
has
shifted
and
where
the
racing
organization
now
stands
on
second
amendment
issues
they've
got
the
drivers
shooting
off
blanks
in
the
winner's
circle
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
david
dolbee
the
general
manager
for
k-var
corp
a
large
distributor
of
firearms
which
submitted
an
advertisement
that
was
rejected
featuring
an
ak-
and
various
accessories
after
a
third-party
advertising
vendor
solicited
ads
for
an
official
nascar
program
earlier
this
year
the
vendor
followed
up
with
gun
companies
in
august
to
inform
them
nascar
had
rejected
advertisements
that
depicted
assault-style
rifles
sniper
rifles
the
advertising
vendor
national
event
publications
sent
an
email
to
some
gun
companies
saying
we
just
heard
from
nascar
on
a
number
of
gun
related
ads
and
unfortunately
due
to
a
gradual
shift
in
nascar's
position
on
guns
these
ads
must
be
edited
changed
especially
those
that
are
depicted
as
assault-style
rifles
sniper
rifles
nascar
is
still
open
to
some
of
the
less
controversial
gun
accessories
concealed
carry
or
classes
the
news
of
those
rejections
was
first
reported
by
the
washington
free
beacon
nascar's
response
via
a
vendor
came
as
a
shock
to
those
in
the
firearms
industry
this
is
a
colossal
mistake
do
they
not
understand
their
own
base
dolbee
said
they
are
a
sporting
organization
trying
to
take
sides
on
a
political
issue
that
never
goes
well
for
any
company
nascar's
position
seems
like
a
pretty
rapid
and
dramatic
shift
to
me
said
ed
newman
one
of
the
founders
of
new
york
firearms
manufacturer
dark
storm
industries
llc
newman
said
his
company
submitted
an
ad
that
was
also
rejected
by
nascar
the
company
posted
about
the
rejection
on
its
instagram
account
we
have
seen
a
significant
response
on
social
media
with
the
majority
of
nascar
fans
expressing
their
disapproval
of
this
shift
in
policy
newman
said
via
email
democrats
have
spent
years
denying
they'll
take
people's
guns
not
anymore
so
far
nascar
has
appeared
unwilling
to
explain
its
shifting
viewpoint
on
the
gun
industry
it
still
partners
with
companies
like
gander
outdoors
and
bass
pro
shops
which
sell
guns
as
well
as
henry
repeating
arms
a
gun
manufacturer
nascar
did
not
respond
to
several
requests
for
comment
for
this
story
nascar's
apparent
shift
comes
as
other
us
companies
have
begun
reevaluating
their
relationship
with
the
gun
industry
walmart
announced
earlier
this
month
it
will
reduce
gun
and
ammunition
sales
a
month
after
more
than
people
were
killed
in
a
mass
shooting
at
an
el
paso
texas
walmart
dick's
sporting
goods
stopped
selling
semi-automatic
assault-style
rifles
and
high-capacity
magazines
after
a
mass
shooting
in
parkland
florida
earlier
this
year
it
announced
it
stopped
selling
guns
and
ammunition
at
of
its
stores
where
sales
have
lagged
trump
offers
no
more
clarity
on
what
gun
control
policies
he
would
support
in
a
show
of
force
thursday
business
leaders
penned
a
letter
to
congress
demanding
action
on
gun
violence
lawrence
keane
senior
vice
president
for
government
and
public
affairs
at
the
national
shooting
sports
foundation
initially
expressed
frustration
about
nascar's
apparent
shift
i
don't
know
what
they
hope
to
accomplish
by
refusing
advertising
of
a
legal
product
that
their
fans
are
interested
in
purchasing
keane
said
if
this
is
an
attempt
at
virtue-signaling
they
didn't
put
their
blinker
on
but
on
friday
he
said
the
trade
group
has
begun
a
respectful
and
productive
dialogue
with
nascar
to
figure
out
what
is
going
on
the
national
rifle
association's
lobbying
arm
in
the
meantime
made
its
displeasure
apparent
in
an
online
post
it
is
not
clear
if
nascar
is
now
taking
an
official
position
in
opposition
to
semi-automatic
rifles
with
the
ar-
variants
often
referred
to
as
america's
rifle
and
bolt
action
rifles
according
to
the
nra
post
what
does
seem
clear
however
is
that
nascar
doesn't
want
to
see
such
things
advertised
in
its
official
publication
in
the
future
a
decision
that
could
easily
alienate
a
great
many
of
its
most
ardent
fans
