donald
trump
said
thursday
afternoon
that
he
won't
name
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
as
john
bolton's
replacement
on
the
national
security
council
despite
reports
the
unusual
move
was
under
consideration
i
think
he's
fantastic
but
i
actually
spoke
to
mike
pompeo
about
that
trump
said
outside
the
white
house
adding
that
he
and
pompeo
get
along
well
because
we
have
a
lot
of
the
same
view
and
a
couple
of
different
ones
but
the
president
added
that
pompeo
likes
the
idea
of
having
someone
in
there
with
him
and
i
do
too
cnn
reported
on
wednesday
that
administration
officials
are
discussing
the
possibility
of
replacing
bolton
with
pompeo
under
this
scenario
the
country's
top
diplomat
would
absorb
the
national
security
adviser
role
and
do
both
jobs
according
to
a
senior
administration
official
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
possibilities
that
would
make
pompeo
the
second
person
in
history
to
have
both
jobs
at
the
same
time
the
first
henry
kissinger
was
already
president
richard
nixon's
national
security
adviser
when
he
was
appointed
secretary
of
state
in
and
he
filled
both
roles
for
two
years
trump
said
he's
now
considering
candidates
after
saying
there
were
five
on
wednesday
the
president
added
that
working
with
him
is
easy
because
i
make
all
the
decisions
and
they
don't
have
to
work
