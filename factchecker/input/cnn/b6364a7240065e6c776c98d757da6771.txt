washington
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke
on
friday
defended
his
support
for
a
mandatory
gun
buyback
program
of
assault-style
weapons
saying
he
believes
it's
an
issue
that
resonates
with
voters
including
some
conservatives
during
the
presidential
debate
thursday
night
o'rourke
said
that
if
elected
president
he
would
issue
a
mandatory
buyback
program
for
assault-style
rifles
saying
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
the
comments
are
striking
not
just
for
their
directness
but
also
because
for
decades
democrats
have
avoided
suggesting
that
the
government
should
take
back
guns
out
of
concern
that
such
a
platform
would
be
politically
toxic
in
much
of
the
country
asked
by
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
new
day
friday
if
he
was
concerned
that
his
call
would
imperil
democrats
chances
in
the
general
election
o'rourke
said
he
was
not
and
that
he's
been
listening
to
conservatives
reflecting
on
his
campaign
stop
in
bland
county
virginia
in
august
he
said
citizens
are
open
to
the
idea
of
giving
up
assault
weapons
the
point
beto
o'rourke
just
did
republicans
a
massive
favor
on
guns
it's
not
a
concern
of
mine
and
that's
in
part
informed
by
listening
to
people
in
conservative
parts
of
america
and
the
southwestern
part
of
virginia
he
said
the
folks
in
bland
county
as
conservative
as
it
might
be
as
proud
a
gun
owner
as
they
might
be
they're
talking
about
this
issue
and
folks
are
saying
look
i
would
give
up
that
ar-
or
that
ak-
i
don't
need
it
to
hunt
don't
need
it
to
defend
myself
in
my
home
they
recognize
this
is
a
weapon
designed
for
war
to
kill
people
as
effectively
as
efficiently
and
in
as
great
a
number
as
possible
speaking
to
cnn's
poppy
harlow
on
newsroom
later
friday
morning
sen
chris
coons
d-delaware
said
he
does
not
support
a
mandatory
gun
buyback
program
and
criticized
o'rourke's
debate
remarks
i
frankly
think
that
that
clip
will
be
played
for
years
at
second
amendment
rallies
with
organizations
that
try
to
scare
people
by
saying
democrats
are
coming
for
your
guns
he
said
i'm
a
gun
owner
my
sons
and
i
have
gone
skeet
shooting
and
hunting
and
frankly
i
don't
think
having
our
presidential
candidates
like
congressman
o'rourke
did
say
that
we're
going
to
try
and
take
people's
guns
against
their
will
is
wise
either
he
also
said
while
he
respects
o'rourke's
passion
he
doesn't
think
the
policy
is
going
to
be
accepted
i
don't
think
a
majority
of
the
senate
or
the
country
is
going
to
embrace
mandatory
buybacks
he
said
we
need
to
focus
on
what
we
can
get
done
and
we
need
to
focus
on
the
challenge
here
which
is
that
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
and
the
republicans
in
the
senate
and
our
president
are
refusing
to
listen
to
the
of
americans
who
want
us
to
do
something
on
background
checks
let's
get
that
done
first
twitter

threatening
beto
o'rourke
with

on
friday
o'rourke
also
spoke
about
republican
texas
state
rep
briscoe
cain's
tweet
in
which
he
threatened
o'rourke
with
an
ar-
the
tweet
has
since
been
taken
down
by
twitter
any
time
you
have
somebody
threatening
to
use
violence
against
somebody
in
this
country
to
resolve
a
political
issue
really
for
any
reason
that's
a
matter
for
law
enforcement
he
said
representative
briscoe
cain
is
making
the
case
that
no
one
should
have
an
ar-
that
they
can
hold
over
someone
in
this
country
say
look
if
we
disagree
on
something
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
ar-
absolutely
wrong
o'rourke
is
one
of
three
democrats
along
with
sens
kamala
harris
of
california
and
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
to
support
mandatory
buybacks
for
certain
guns
other
democrats
would
make
them
illegal
but
not
require
them
to
be
bought
back
by
the
government
according
to
a
npr
pbs
newshour
marist
poll
released
this
week
of
americans

congress
should
create
a

assault
guns
