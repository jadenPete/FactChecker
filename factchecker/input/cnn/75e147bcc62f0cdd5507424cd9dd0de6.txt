this
has
become
the
central
dividing
line
in
the
democratic
presidential
race
cnn
the
wine
track
and
the
beer
track
are
back
the
leading
candidates
in
the
democratic
presidential
race
are
assembling
coalitions
of
support
through
the
early
primary
polling
that
are
reminiscent
of
the
patterns
that
repeatedly
shaped
the
struggles
for
the
party's
nomination
in
the
last
decades
of
the
th
century
like
such
predecessors
as
hubert
humphrey
walter
mondale
bill
clinton
and
al
gore
former
vice
president
joe
biden
is
relying
heavily
on
voters
from
what's
been
called
the
democrats
beer
track
blue-collar
older
and
moderate
whites
along
with
african
americans
meanwhile
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
who
many
in
the
party
see
emerging
as
biden's
most
serious
rival
is
following
such
brainy
predecessors
as
george
mcgovern
gary
hart
paul
tsongas
jerry
brown
and
howard
dean
to
run
best
among
voters
from
the
wine
track
college-educated
white
liberals
bernie
sanders
the
third
candidate
leading
the
polls
straddles
this
divide
relying
heavily
on
independents
and
young
people
who
often
gravitate
toward
wine
track
candidates
but
also
showing
consistent
strength
among
working-class
whites
this
week's
new
national
cnn
poll
of
democrats
vividly
underscored
these
patterns
it
showed
warren
rocketing
to
a
double-digit
lead
among
college-educated
white
democrats
the
central
pillar
of
the
wine
track
constituency
she
drew
of
them
to
biden's
and
sanders
the
poll
also
showed
biden
consolidating
the
key
components
of
the
historic
beer
track
among
white
democrats
without
college
degrees
he
drew
to
for
sanders
and
just
for
warren
his
lead
was
even
more
commanding
among
african
americans
of
whom
said
they
are
supporting
biden
compared
with
just
for
sanders
and
for
warren
this
reversion
to
the
voter
alignments
that
drove
the
party
primaries
during
the
late
th
century
represents
a
back
to
the
future
moment
for
the
democrats
in
barack
obama
scrambled
this
historic
pattern
and
won
the
nomination
by
combining
a
strong
performance
among
college-educated
whites
with
a
big
advantage
among
african
americans
to
an
underappreciated
extent
hillary
clinton
followed
that
model
to
beat
back
the
unexpectedly
strong
challenge
from
sanders
in
in
effect
obama
and
then
clinton
moved
black
voters
from
the
beer
track
to
the
wine
track
creating
a
new
winning
majority
but
now
biden
with
his
strength
among
blue-collar
and
older
whites
and
african
americans
has
established
a
consistent
lead
in
national
polls
by
reassembling
the
historic
beer
track
coalition
that
fractured
in
and
that
suggests
one
of
the
decisive
questions
for
democrats
in
the
coming
months
is
whether
another
candidate
can
dislodge
enough
african
american
voters
from
biden's
camp
to
re-create
something
like
the
obama
coalition
of
black
voters
and
white-collar
whites
warren
today
looks
best
positioned
to
do
that
but
many
believe
that
sen
kamala
harris
of
california
despite
her
uneven
performance
so
far
could
still
find
an
audience
among
college-educated
whites
and
african
americans
especially
women
in
both
groups
democratic
party
lanes
from
the
first
year
that
control
of
the
nomination
shifted
mostly
from
party
bosses
at
conventions
to
voters
via
primaries
through
the
democratic
race
often
reduced
to
one
leading
candidate
from
each
of
these
two
lanes
what
i've
called
in
the
past
the
wine
track
and
the
beer
track
the
democrats
are
split
on
the
one
hand
racially
and
on
the
other
hand
in
class
terms
says
northeastern
university
political
scientist
william
mayer
an
expert
on
the
presidential
primary
process
and
those
have
been
persistent
differences
all
the
way
through
you
could
even
go
back
to
the
wine
track
candidates
have
drawn
support
primarily
from
well-educated
financially
comfortable
white
voters
many
of
whom
identify
as
independents
rather
than
partisan
democrats
who
are
liberal
on
social
and
foreign
policy
issues
but
generally
less
focused
on
economic
concerns
beer
track
candidates
have
relied
mostly
on
blue-collar
whites
and
african
americans
more
open
to
lunch-bucket
economic
appeals
and
moderate
to
conservative
positions
on
cultural
and
national
security
issues
not
all
presidential
primaries
divided
the
party
along
these
lines
but
when
they
did
the
beer
track
candidate
almost
always
beat
the
contender
from
the
wine
track
in
beer-track
candidate
mondale
the
favorite
of
organized
labor
beat
atari
democrat
hart
the
champion
of
new
ideas
in
bill
clinton
with
a
message
that
married
economic
populism
with
the
notion
of
personal
responsibility
in
social
policy
amassed
strong
margins
among
blue-collar
whites
and
african
americans
to
beat
tsongas
and
brown
each
of
whom
had
considerable
appeal
to
upscale
white
liberals
in
gore
used
a
similar
coalition
to
easily
turn
aside
the
challenge
from
former
sen
bill
bradley
who
also
ran
well
among
wine-track
voters
the
divide
wasn't
quite
as
sharply
delineated
in
but
jimmy
carter
relied
on
a
similar
pattern
of
support
particularly
a
big
lead
among
african
american
voters
to
win
the
nomination
over
rivals
who
included
wine-track
favorite
morris
udall
a
wry
liberal
us
representative
from
arizona
how
obama
and
hillary
clinton
prevailed
the
clearest
exception
to
the
beer
track's
preeminence
came
in
when
mcgovern
mobilized
white
liberals
and
young
people
to
win
the
nomination
over
humphrey
a
classic
beer
track
candidate
bolstered
by
strong
support
from
organized
labor
still
even
mcgovern
benefited
from
a
divided
opposition
and
won
the
nomination
with
only
about
one-fourth
of
the
total
primary
vote
obama
shattered
these
pieces
and
reassembled
them
into
a
new
combination
in
his
epic
primary
victory
over
hillary
clinton
obama
that
year
split
college-educated
white
voters
the
core
of
the
wine
track
constituency
almost
exactly
in
half
with
clinton
and
captured
more
than
four-fifths
of
african
american
voters
according
to
a
cumulative
analysis
by
abc
pollster
gary
langer
of
all
the
primary
exit
polls
conducted
that
allowed
obama
to
overcome
clinton's
to-
advantage
among
white
voters
without
college
degrees
clinton
more
than
is
commonly
realized
followed
that
same
path
to
beat
sanders
eight
years
later
as
obama
did
against
her
in
clinton
in
split
college-educated
white
voters
almost
exactly
in
half
against
sanders
but
she
won
more
than
three-fourths
of
african-american
voters
according
to
a
cumulative
cnn
analysis
of
all
the
exit
polls
she
also
won
about
three-fifths
of
hispanics
and
nearly
two-thirds
of
voters
who
identified
as
democrats
that
allowed
clinton
to
survive
sanders
nearly
double-digit
advantage
among
white
voters
without
college
degrees
as
well
as
his
huge
leads
among
younger
voters
and
independents
who
participated
in
the
democratic
primary
the
success
in
both
and
of
the
obama
model
for
winning
the
nomination
reflected
in
part
the
changing
nature
of
the
democratic
coalition
compared
with
the
late
th
century
white
voters
without
college
degrees
now
make
up
a
much
smaller
share
of
the
democratic
electorate
while
college
whites
and
minorities
have
grown
in
according
to
the
cumulative
cnn
exit
poll
analysis
whites
with
at
least
four-year
college
degrees
represented
the
single
largest
slice
of
democratic
primary
voters
just
over
one-third
african
americans
and
whites
without
college
degrees
each
composed
about
one-fourth
of
the
electorate
with
voters
from
other
racial
minorities
contributing
the
final
roughly
one-seventh
what
warren
sanders
need
to
do
with
these
demographic
changes
as
the
backdrop
some
democratic
strategists
such
as
robby
mook
clinton's
campaign
manager
in
predicted
as
the
primaries
began
that
this
thing
will
be
won
in
by
some
combination
of
the
obama
coalition
college
whites
and
african
americans
but
so
far
this
year
the
three
major
pieces
of
the
democratic
electorate
college
and
non-college
whites
and
minorities
especially
african-americans
are
combining
in
patterns
that
look
more
like
the
late
th
century
than
the
and
races
dominated
by
the
obama
coalition
in
most
polls
biden
has
held
a
strong
lead
among
african
americans
as
well
as
older
and
more
moderate
voters
of
all
races
usually
he
also
runs
more
strongly
among
white
voters
without
college
degrees
than
those
with
advanced
education
in
the
abc
washington
post
national
democratic
primary
poll
released
sunday
for
instance
he
won
of
whites
without
college
degrees
compared
with
of
those
with
degrees
warren's
support
usually
inverts
that
pattern
in
the
abc
wp
poll
she
drew
of
college-educated
whites
leading
among
them
compared
with
among
non-college
whites
the
latest
national
quinnipiac
university
poll
showed
her
trailing
biden
narrowly
among
college
whites
while
he
held
a
point
advantage
among
non-college
whites
and
a
roughly
point
lead
among
african
americans
warren
also
consistently
runs
much
better
with
liberals
than
moderates
the
abc
washington
post
survey
found
her
drawing
about
in-
of
the
former
compared
with
only
about
in-
of
the
latter
sanders
also
run
much
better
with
liberals
than
moderates
and
does
better
with
younger
than
older
voters
and
with
non-college
rather
than
college
whites
many
democratic
analysts
argue
that
these
patterns
present
warren
and
sanders
with
the
same
challenge
expanding
their
bases
beyond
more
liberal
whites
though
their
support
doesn't
entirely
overlap
sanders
tilts
more
toward
blue-collar
whites
warren
toward
white-collar
ones
for
instance
they
share
the
common
problem
of
attracting
meager
numbers
so
far
among
african
americans
i
think
that
the
foundation
for
these
candidacies
is
pretty
clear
says
david
axelrod
the
top
political
strategist
for
obama
and
a
senior
cnn
political
commentator
in
the
case
of
warren
and
sanders
it's
incumbent
on
them
to
expand
their
bases
can
warren
do
it
in
sanders
ran
competitively
with
younger
african
americans
but
overall
attracted
just
one-fifth
of
black
voters
according
to
the
cumulative
cnn
exit
poll
this
time
many
democratic
observers
give
warren
a
better
chance
than
sanders
of
building
a
beachhead
in
the
black
community
if
she
emerges
in
a
strong
position
from
the
first
contests
in
iowa
and
new
hampshire
though
warren's
poll
numbers
remain
modest
among
black
voters
she
has
been
well
received
before
predominantly
minority
audiences
such
as
the
she
the
people
and
national
action
network
gatherings
last
april
and
a
cnn
town
hall
before
a
largely
african
american
crowd
in
jackson
mississippi
last
march
in
a
business
analogy
the
question
is
how
do
you
scale
says
adam
green
co-founder
of
the
progressive
change
campaign
committee
which
has
endorsed
warren
i
look
at
those
performances
as
a
trial
market
and
then
the
question
is
how
do
you
scale
your
production
to
a
national
audience
and
national
market
latosha
brown
co-founder
of
the
atlanta-based
black
voters
matter
agrees
that
warren
or
perhaps
harris
could
still
find
an
audience
among
black
voters
particularly
women
brown
said
that
while
biden
starts
with
an
advantage
in
the
black
community
based
on
his
familiarity
and
his
role
as
obama's
vice
president
she
believes
he
has
not
been
able
to
expand
or
harden
that
support
during
the
campaign
i
think
he's
maintaining
brown
said
i
just
don't
see
any
new
ground
and
in
some
ways
i
think
he's
losing
a
little
ground
young
people
are
not
excited
by
this
campaign
at
all
that
tepid
response
brown
believes
has
left
an
opening
for
warren
or
perhaps
harris
though
brown
cautions
that
harris
has
not
yet
established
the
connection
she
expected
elizabeth
warren
has
folks
attention
brown
said
they
are
not
committed
just
yet
to
her
but
in
terms
of
conversations
i've
had
with
black
women
people
are
saying
i'm
listening
she
has
my
attention
the
stakes
could
not
be
higher
for
the
other
candidates
in
eroding
biden's
advantage
among
black
voters
liberal
college
whites
are
growing
as
a
share
of
the
democratic
electorate
and
warren
in
particular
has
shown
the
potential
to
become
a
very
strong
candidate
among
them
as
demonstrated
by
the
huge
crowds
she
recently
drew
in
the
white-collar
enclaves
of
minneapolis
and
seattle
but
many
party
strategists
remain
dubious
that
warren
or
anyone
else
can
win
by
consolidating
those
voters
alone
if
biden
maintains
an
edge
with
the
party's
other
two
biggest
blocks
blacks
and
blue-collar
whites
i
still
think
she's
operating
in
too
small
a
sandbox
says
joe
trippi
the
campaign
manager
in
for
howard
dean
another
wine
track
candidate
who
fell
short
i
think
she's
running
the
best
campaign
of
anybody
out
there
i
think
they
are
doing
a
lot
of
things
right
the
problem
for
her
is
so
far
what
looks
like
an
inability
to
broaden
out
her
to
reach
to
more
diverse
elements
of
the
party
bernie
had
that
problem
in
biden
wants
to
run
in
the
general
election
against
president
donald
trump
by
offering
to
restore
a
sense
of
normalcy
after
all
the
turmoil
of
trump's
presidency
whether
biden
gets
the
chance
to
present
that
case
may
depend
on
whether
he
can
first
restore
the
beer
track
as
the
winning
path
to
the
democratic
nomination
