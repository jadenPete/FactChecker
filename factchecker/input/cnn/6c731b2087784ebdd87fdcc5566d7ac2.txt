washington
cnn
former
president
jimmy
carter
said
if
he
were
years
old
he
would
not
be
able
to
handle
the
responsibilities
of
being
president
and
joked
that
he
hopes
there
is
an
age
limit
on
the
office
the
comments
from
the
year-old
former
commander-in-chief
are
especially
notable
as
the
age
of
the
three
top
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
who
are
in
their
s
has
been
the
subject
of
ongoing
debate
the
th
president
didn't
mention
any
democratic
candidates
by
name
at
a
town
hall
at
the
carter
center
in
atlanta
on
tuesday
night
when
he
was
asked
if
he
might
consider
running
for
a
second
non-consecutive
term
i
hope
there
is
an
age
limit
he
said
as
the
audience
laughed
you
know
if
i
were
just
years
old
if
i
were
years
younger
i
don't
believe
i
could
undertake
the
duties
that
i
experienced
when
i
was
president
carter
said
the
presidency
requires
mental
fortitude
and
one
must
be
able
to
adapt
to
new
ideas
the
race
is
dominated
by
somethings
for
one
thing
you
have
to
be
very
flexible
with
your
mind
you
have
to
be
able
to
go
from
one
subject
to
another
on
concentrate
on
each
one
adequately
and
then
put
then
all
together
in
a
comprehensive
way
like
i
did
with
begin
and
sadat
with
the
peace
agreement
carter
said
referring
to
a
egypt-israel
treaty
that
was
signed
by
egyptian
president
anwar
sadat
and
israeli
prime
minister
menachem
begin
he
also
said
one
must
have
a
lot
of
personal
courage
when
being
president
citing
the
accords
that
handed
over
control
of
the
waterway
to
panama
so
the
things
i
faced
then
in
foreign
affairs
i
don't
think
i
could
undertake
them
when
i
was
years
old
so
is
out
of
the
question
i
had
a
hard
time
walking
when
i
came
in
said
carter
whose
birthday
is
on
october
age
has
been
an
ongoing
topic
of
discussion
in
the
campaign
president
donald
trump
who
is
years
old
became
the
oldest
first-term
president
when
he
was
inaugurated
and
the
top
three
democratic
contenders
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
would
also
be
among
the
oldest
first-term
presidents
in
history
biden
has
said
it's
totally
appropriate
for
voters
to
consider
his
age
when
evaluating
candidates
but
he's
repeatedly
said
he's
up
for
the
presidency
