i
always
look
orange
trump
rails
against
energy-efficient
light
bulbs
and
democratic
environmental
policies
cnn
president
donald
trump
on
thursday
evening
claimed
that
energy
efficient
light
bulbs
make
him
look
orange
one
in
a
series
of
bizarre
claims
about
green
energy
and
climate
conservation
in
remarks
to
republican
house
members
in
baltimore
what's
with
the
lightbulb
trump
asked
introducing
one
of
several
environmentally
related
rants
in
his
more
than
hour-long
remarks
he
described
energy
efficient
light
bulbs
as
many
times
more
expensive
than
that
old
incandescent
bulb
that
worked
very
well
and
the
lights
no
good
the
bulb
that
we're
being
forced
to
use
number
one
to
me
most
importantly
i
always
look
orange
he
said
to
laughs
from
the
audience
light
bulbs
have
been
a
common
target
for
the
president
who
has
used
them
as
a
symbol
to
criticize
energy
and
environmental
restrictions
federal
regulators
in
the
trump
administration
lifted
energy
efficiency
regulations
earlier
this
month
for
several
common
types
of
light
bulbs
which
critics
believe
is
the
administration's
latest
assault
on
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
and
energy
use
the
administration
said
the
overturned
rules
crafted
in
the
final
days
of
the
obama
administration
and
which
were
set
to
take
effect
in
january
would
cause
prices
for
light
bulbs
to
skyrocket
to
untenable
levels
trump
also
railed
against
the
paris
climate
accords
which
he
decided
the
us
would
pull
out
of
early
in
his
administration
how's
that
working
out
for
paris
trump
asked
pointing
to
yellow
vest
protesters
in
france
trump
said
the
protesters
didn't
like
all
of
that
money
being
sent
to
people
that
they'd
never
heard
of
the
country
which
they
came
but
specifically
the
yellow
vest
demonstrators
have
protested
rising
fuel
taxes
in
france
and
have
called
for
an
increase
to
the
minimum
wage
speaking
about
the
paris
agreement
trump
said
they
were
going
to
take
away
our
wealth
they
were
going
to
say
we
can't
do
certain
businesses
we
can't
take
the
oil
and
gas
we
can't
do
anything
this
would
have
been
one
of
the
great
travesties
trump
also
said
the
agreement
would
do
nothing
to
improve
our
environment
but
would
instead
punish
the
united
states
while
foreign
polluters
operate
with
impunity
as
part
of
the
agreement
the
obama
administration
pledged
to
slash
carbon
emissions
by
below
levels
by
trump
announced
the
us
would
be
pulling
out
of
the
agreement
in
june
trump
claimed
during
his
speech
the
clean
waters
act
didn't
give
clean
waters
the
same
day
the
environmental
protection
agency
announced
the
repeal
of
an
obama-era
rule
that
extended
federal
authority
and
protections
to
streams
and
wetlands
the
regulation
defined
what
bodies
of
water
are
protected
under
the
federal
clean
water
act
but
was
a
favorite
punching
bag
of
republicans
who
ridicule
it
as
government
overreach
democrats
defended
it
as
necessary
to
ensure
waterways
remained
pollution-free
trump
in
his
baltimore
speech
bolstered
his
campaign
pillar
of
energy
dominance
in
the
united
states
also
praising
the
quality
of
american
air
and
water
he
said
today
we
have
the
cleanest
air
we
have
the
cleanest
water
that
we've
ever
had
in
the
history
of
our
country
for
the
last
years
as
it
relates
to
drinking
water
specifically
the
us
is
tied
for
first
among
nine
other
countries
for
the
best
in
the
world
as
cnn
has
previously
reported
on
this
claim
by
the
trump
administration
but
it's
incorrect
to
categorically
assert
the
us
has
the
cleanest
air
and
water
in
the
world
trump
later
said
that
for
a
virtually
insignificant
amount
of
energy
the
us
would
soon
be
producing
cars
that
are
substantially
less
expensive
and
much
safer
because
they
will
be
made
of
denser
materials
he
appeared
to
be
referencing
new
auto
industry
standards
he
said
would
soon
be
released
by
the
trump
administration
trump
took
to
criticizing
democrats
stance
on
several
environmental
issues
becoming
frustrated
with
recent
efforts
to
reduce
plastic
and
reiterating
his
repeated
claims
about
the
green
new
deal
then
they
talk
about
plastic
straws
i
said
what
about
the
plate
what
about
the
wrapper
that's
made
up
of
a
tougher
plastic
what
about
all
the
other
plastic
trump
said
adding
that
straws
are
the
only
thing
we're
worried
about
now
he
later
told
republicans
we
won't
let
democrats
obliterate
the
plastic
industry
and
cripple
working
class
families
with
sky-high
energy
prices
he
also
claimed
that
the
green
new
deal
would
mean
no
more
cows
no
more
planes
and
i
guess
no
more
people
right
the
resolution
looks
to
overhaul
transportation
in
the
us
by
removing
pollution
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
the
transportation
sector
as
much
as
is
technologically
feasible
when
it
comes
to
cows
and
farming
the
language
is
similar
looking
to
remove
pollution
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
the
agricultural
sector
as
much
as
is
technologically
feasible
trump
didn't
spare
criticism
for
his
former
democratic
rival
hillary
clinton
who
wanted
the
country
to
invest
in
wind
energy
and
solar
energy
as
part
of
her
platform
solar
is
fine
you
know
small
potatoes
compared
to
what
we're
talking
about
doesn't
have
the
power
what
you
need
trump
said
the
wind
is
very
expensive
he
continued
adding
that
windmills
are
imported
from
germany
and
china
he
reiterated
his
previous
claims
that
windmills
devalue
real
estate
kill
birds
are
noisy
and
provide
intermittent
energy
adding
think
of
the
pollutants
that
go
in
the
air
when
they
make
in
these
massive
steel
things
several
major
academic
studies
have
found
no
statistically
significant
decrease
in
the
average
property
value
due
to
wind
turbines
in
the
us
and
while
the
department
of
energy
has
said
that
wind
turbines
can
be
noisy
and
impact
wildlife
in
their
path
it
has
also
described
the
energy
source
as
cost
effective
and
sustainable
a
report
from
doe
also
indicates
that
the
us
is
a
net
importer
of
wind
turbine
equipment
and
germany
and
china
lead
the
number
of
wind-specific
imports
to
the
us
this
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
developments
friday
