citing
disagreements
on
several
issues
and
as
he
confronts
a
major
foreign
policy
crisis
following
the
attack

saudi
oil
facilities
which
the
administration
has
blamed
on
iran

securing

and
said
we
know
each

well
adding
robert's

fantastic
as
a
hostage
negotiator
and
that
the
us
hasn't
spent
any
money
to
secure
the
hostages
release
o'brien
also
complimented
trump
in
brief
remarks
while
standing
alongside
the
president
it's
a
privilege
to
serve
with
the
president
we
look
forward
to
another
year
and
a
half
of
peace
through
strength
he
said
we've
had
tremendous
foreign
policy
successes
under
president
trump's
leadership
i
expect
those
to
continue
a
penchant
for
flattery
the
hostage
negotiator
interviewed
for
the
post
with
the
president
and
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
last
week
and
enjoyed
support
from
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
is
now
the
most
influential
national
security
voice
in
the
administration
trump
who
is
known
to
respond
well
to
flattery
has
recounted
praise
from
o'brien
in
tweets
and
in
conversations
suggesting
that
the
new
national
security
adviser
also
knows
how
to
handle
the
president
and
his
mercurial
moods
o'brien
has
also
made
trump
look
good
giving
him
numbers
to
boast
about
and
successes
that
made
for
high
profile
media
coverage
speaking
to
reporters
aboard
air
force
one
on
tuesday
trump
again
highlighted
o'brien's
praise
of
him
in
securing
the
release
of
hostages
robert
o'brien
said
trump
is
the
greatest
hostage
negotiator
in
history
he
happens
to
be
right
trump
said
according
to
pool
reporters
we
are
ask
robert
in
fact
i
had
never
heard
the
term
robert
o'brien
said
donald
trump
is
the
greatest
hostage
negotiator
of
all
time
at
the
time
he
said
it
we
were
we
are
cnn
has
contacted
the
state
department
for
further
details
on
the
numbers
cited
by
trump
during
an
oval
office
meeting
in
march
o'brien
celebrated
trump
for
his
success
returning
american
hostages
this
wouldn't
happen
with
all
of
these
hostages
and
detainees
without
the
support
of
the
president
he
said
the
president
has
had
unparalleled
success
in
bringing
americans
home
without
paying
concessions
trump
wants
a
consensus
builder
one
senior
white
house
official
argued
the
pick
shows
that
trump
wants
a
consensus
builder
not
a
showboater
in
the
role
suggesting
o'brien
will
cut
a
lower
profile
and
work
better
with
others
in
the
administration
than
john
bolton
did
o'brien
though
has
far
less
national
security
or
foreign
policy
experience
than
past
national
security
advisers
under
trump
or
otherwise
cnn
previously
reported
that
the
national
security
adviser
role
was
expected
to
be
diminished
in
the
wake
of
bolton's
departure
as
trump
increasingly
relies
on
his
own
instincts
republican
sen
mitt
romney
congratulated
o'brien
who
served
as
an
adviser
on
romney's
presidential
campaign
in
in
a
tweet
tuesday
congratulations
to
my
friend
robert
o'brien
who
the
president
has
appointed
to
serve
as
national
security
advisor
as
the
special
presidential
envoy
for
hostage
affairs
he
has
doggedly
pursued
the
release
of
american
hostages
abroad
he
is
a
man
of
the
highest
integrity
he
wrote
trump
was
considering
a
number
of
other
candidates
for
the
post
and
yesterday
named
five
people
under
consideration
o'brien
ricky
waddell
fred
fleitz
keith
kellogg
and
lisa
gordon-hagerty
other
officials
believed
to
be
under
consideration
included
the
us
special
envoy
for
iran
brian
hook
who
is
close
to
trump's
senior
adviser
and
son-in-law
jared
kushner
but
who
was
criticized
as
a
never
trumper
by
other
advisers
trump
had
also
been
considering
rob
blair
a
national
security
aide
to
mulvaney
who
is
nonetheless
considered
a
long
shot
inside
the
west
wing
pentagon
ordered
to
offer
options
as
us
rules
out
knee
jerk
response
to
saudi
attack
trump
has
solicited
recommendations
on
the
selection
from
advisers
and
friends
but
officials
said
he
would
likely
rely
principally
on
advice
from
pompeo
trump
said
last
week
that
he'd
asked
his
chief
diplomat
if
he
was
interested
in
also
taking
on
the
national
security
adviser
job
but
that
he
had
declined
trump
has
picked
o'brien
at
a
time
when
he
is
confronting
another
yet
another
foreign
policy
crisis
following
the
attack
on
saudi
oil
fields
a
situation
that
lays
bare
his
dueling
instincts
in
the
region
inclinations
that
ended
bolton's
tenure
and
are
bound
to
complicate
his
replacement's
in
mulling
his
response
options
trump
finds
himself
drawn
in
opposing
directions
while
he
has
long
sought
to
appear
strong
on
iran
he
has
promised
voters
he
won't
be
drawn
into
another
middle
east
war
and
says
he's
open
to
talking
cnn
previously
reported
that
in
his
interviews
and
in
interactions
over
the
past
days
trump
has
sought
to
gauge
whether
those
vying
for
the
national
security
post
agree
with
his
overarching
view
that
the
united
states
should
limit
its
activities
abroad
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
