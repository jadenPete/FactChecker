administration
considers
double-tapping
pompeo
for
national
security
adviser
washington
cnn
just
one
day
after
president
donald
trump
dismissed
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
administration
officials
are
discussing
the
possibility
of
replacing
bolton
with
his
chief
rival
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
under
this
scenario
the
country's
top
diplomat
would
absorb
the
national
security
adviser
role
and
do
both
jobs
according
to
a
senior
administration
official
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
possibilities
that
would
make
pompeo
the
second
person
in
history
to
have
both
jobs
at
the
same
time
the
first
henry
kissinger
was
already
president
richard
nixon's
national
security
adviser
when
he
was
appointed
secretary
of
state
in
and
filled
both
roles
for
two
years
it's
unclear
how
seriously
trump
is
considering
this
possibility
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
process
says
that
pompeo
has
given
the
president
a
list
of
other
names
to
consider
on
wednesday
when
asked
about
his
top
picks
to
replace
bolton
the
president
said
i
have
five
people
that
want
it
very
much
five
people
that
i
consider
very
highly
qualified
good
people
tuesday
night
attending
a
washington
charity
ball
with
his
wife
pompeo
laughed
with
friends
about
bolton
being
fired
the
two
were
often
at
odds
with
each
other
and
had
even
stopped
talking
to
each
other
outside
formal
meetings
pompeo
was
jovial
and
his
mentality
was
what
a
day
what
a
life
what
a
job
explained
a
source
who
was
at
the
event
for
now
pompeo
will
remain
the
president's
primary
foreign
policy
adviser
explained
another
source
close
to
the
white
house
he
is
going
to
act
as
national
security
adviser
at
least
in
the
near
term
trump
is
happy
with
that
the
person
said
an
administration
official
cautions
that
the
kissinger
model
could
be
dangerous
for
pompeo
especially
given
his
dominant
position
within
the
administration
with
a
dual
role
pompeo
risks
becoming
too
powerful
for
trump's
taste
the
source
said
counselor
to
the
president
kellyanne
conway
didn't
discount
the
possibility
on
thursday
calling
him
an
excellent
secretary
of
state
who
has
the
president's
ear
and
noted
that
it
would
not
be
unprecedented
pointing
to
kissinger
she
did
say
that
trump
is
looking
at
a
slate
of
about
five
or
so
options
with
pompeo
making
that
list
five-plus
the
washington
examiner
was
first
to
report
the
idea
is
being
discussed
the
white
house
and
state
department
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
other
possibilities
if
trump
opts
to
keep
the
position
as
a
stand-alone
role
nearly
a
dozen
potential
bolton
successors
are
being
floated
a
senior
administration
official
and
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
told
cnn
on
wednesday
that
as
of
now
brian
hook
the
us
special
representative
for
iran
and
senior
policy
adviser
to
pompeo
at
the
state
department
and
steve
biegun
the
special
envoy
to
north
korea
have
emerged
as
top
contenders
trump
makes
clear
he's
calling
the
foreign
policy
shots
post
bolton
while
sources
have
cautioned
that
trump
could
always
change
his
mind
and
pick
a
candidate
who
is
not
currently
being
discussed
hook
or
biegun
would
be
a
marked
departure
from
bolton
unlike
bolton
who
was
criticized
by
trump
on
wednesday
for
his
positions
on
several
foreign
policy
issues
including
iran
and
north
korea
hook
and
biegun
are
unlikely
to
challenge
the
president's
desire
for
diplomatic
deal-making
a
quality
that
appears
to
be
a
prerequisite
for
the
national
security
adviser
post
some
officials
said
this
week
that
bolton's
acrimonious
departure
was
a
sign
that
the
role
he
occupied
could
be
diminished
going
forward
much
like
trump
acts
as
his
own
communications
director
and
chief
of
staff
despite
having
actual
staff
members
in
those
roles
he
is
likely
to
look
warily
on
another
national
security
adviser
who
acts
with
as
much
leeway
as
bolton
did
at
least
names
being
discussed
to
replace
john
bolton
eager
to
rack
up
wins
ahead
of
next
year's
reelection
battle
trump
will
also
weigh
a
new
adviser's
political
savvy
particularly
as
he
looks
to
fulfill
campaign
promises
like
withdrawing
troops
from
afghanistan
and
securing
diplomatic
deals
the
problem
officials
and
analysts
say
is
that
like
with
most
elements
of
his
agenda
trump's
views
on
foreign
policy
are
ever-changing
when
bolton
entered
his
post
months
ago
trump
was
agitating
to
withdraw
from
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
frustrated
with
the
coterie
of
advisers
who
were
urging
him
to
remain
in
the
accord
now
after
applying
maximum
pressure
to
iran's
regime
hitting
the
country
and
its
leaders
with
heavy-handed
sanctions
trump
is
turning
in
the
other
direction
and
looking
for
a
diplomatic
opening
with
bolton
who
argued
against
diplomacy
now
gone
trump
is
entertaining
the
possibility
of
meeting
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
at
the
united
nations
later
this
month
those
differences
paired
with
bolton's
isolation
among
trump's
other
advisers
were
his
downfall
i
hope
we've
left
in
good
stead
but
maybe
we
have
and
maybe
we
haven't
trump
said
a
nod
to
the
emerging
discrepancies
in
how
and
when
bolton
left
his
administration
post
trump
went
on
to
criticize
bolton
for
almost
upending
north
korea
talks
with
his
reference
to
the
libya
model
his
advocacy
for
the
iraq
war
during
his
tenure
in
the
george
w.
bush
administration
and
his
views
toward
venezuela
he
made
some
very
big
mistakes
trump
said
of
his
freshly
departed
adviser
he
wasn't
getting
along
with
people
in
the
administration
that
i
consider
very
important
regardless
of
who
if
anyone
replaces
bolton
trump
made
it
clear
wednesday
that
he
will
be
the
one
calling
the
shots
on
us
foreign
policy
and
possibly
changing
course
