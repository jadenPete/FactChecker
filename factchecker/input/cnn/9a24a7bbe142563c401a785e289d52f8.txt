argues
house
lawmakers
should
not
gain
access
to
mueller
grand
jury
materials
cnn
the
justice
department
said
friday
that
a
request
to
a
federal
court
from
house
democrats
seeking
access
to
secret
grand
jury
material
underlying
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
should
be
turned
down
because
the
lawmakers
have
come
nowhere
close
to
demonstrating
a
particularized
need
for
the
information
house
democrats
first
filed
suit
in
july
days
after
mueller's
testimony
on
capitol
hill
asking
the
court
to
order
the
release
of
grand
jury
information
connected
to
the
mueller
report
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
the
democrats
argue
they
need
the
information
to
consider
whether
to
move
toward
impeachment
proceedings
list
the
house
democrats
calling
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
specifically
the
lawmakers
are
seeking
the
unredacted
mueller
report
as
well
as
transcripts
of
grand
jury
testimony
related
to
president
donald
trump's
knowledge
of
russian
efforts
to
interfere
in
the
election
and
links
between
members
of
his
campaign
and
russians
lawmakers
also
want
any
grand
jury
testimony
related
to
trump's
knowledge
of
any
potential
criminal
acts
by
him
or
his
associates
in
the
filing
the
the
justice
department
called
lawmakers
request
an
extraordinary
order
that
is
overly
broad
the
committee's
failure
to
provide
a
tailored
request
accompanied
by
a
concrete
explanation
for
why
this
material
is
necessary
is
particularly
striking
given
the
extensive
investigations
congress
has
already
conducted
into
russian
inference
with
the
election
gathering
information
to
which
the
committee
already
has
access
the
justice
department
wrote
the
justice
department
argued
that
the
committee's
application
for
materials
relies
on
authorization
related
to
a
judicial
proceeding
the
department
argues
that
impeachment
proceedings
in
congress
including
hypothetical
removal
proceedings
in
the
senate
are
not
judicial
proceedings
under
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
that
term
when
house
democrats
first
filed
the
lawsuit
house
judiciary
chairman
jerry
nadler
of
new
york
and
other
committee
democrats
said
that
the
legal
challenge
was
a
new
step
that
signals
the
committee
is
actively
considering
whether
to
introduce
articles
of
impeachment
in
the
filing
the
justice
department
seizes
on
the
ongoing
debate
among
house
democrats
over
how
to
describe
their
impeachment
inquiry
citing
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
denial
that
the
house
is
engaged
in
an
impeachment
proceeding
it
also
cites
comments
by
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
who
earlier
this
week
suggested
that
the
ongoing
effort
in
the
house
judiciary
committee
regarding
the
scope
of
the
impeachment
inquiry
was
an
exercise
to
expedite
litigation
