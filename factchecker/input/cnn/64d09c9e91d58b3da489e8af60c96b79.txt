comedian
fired
from

for
making
bigoted
comments
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
andrew
yang
reiterated
on
monday
his
belief
that
shane
gillis
should
have
kept
his
job
on
saturday
night
live
after
the
comedian's
bigoted
comments
against
chinese
americans
came
to
light
you
know
i've
been
public
about
my
comments
yang
who
is
taiwanese-american
told
cnn
during
a
gaggle
with
reporters
after
a
campaign
rally
in
cambridge
massachusetts
following
news
of
the
comedian's
ouster
i
think
that
he
deserved
another
chance
to
keep
his
job
but
the
folks
at
nbc
obviously
felt
differently
asked
why
he
believes
gillis
deserved
another
chance
yang
said
he
believes
as
a
society
we
have
become
unduly
punitive
and
vindictive
about
people
making
statements
that
some
find
offensive
or
distasteful
as
the
person
who
was
personally
called
out
in
this
case
i
thought
that
if
i
could
set
an
example
that
we
can
forgive
people
particularly
in
an
instance
where
in
my
mind
it
was
in
a
comedic
context
or
a
gray
area
that
i
thought
it
would
be
positive
obviously
it
is
in
nbc's
hands
and
they
made
the
decision
they
made
he
said
shortly
after
gillis
hire
was
announced
last
week
his
past
defamatory
comments
about
chinese
americans
and
homosexuals
made
during
a
podcast
surfaced
prompting
the
comic
to
apologize
the
long-running
sketch
comedy
show
announced
on
monday
it
had
fired
gillis
and
that
his
remarks
were
offensive
hurtful
and
unacceptable
yang
said
monday
afternoon
that
gillis
reached
out
to
him
looks
like
we
will
be
sitting
down
together
soon
