trump
has
always
measured
himself
against
obama's
legacy
now
he's
griping
about
obama
chasing
him
trump
suggests
investigation
into
obama-netflix
deal
washington
cnn
for
all
of
president
donald
trump's
gripes
with
his
predecessor
this
could
prove
the
most
galling
his
entry
into
television
after
all
it's
that
the
world
trump
has
occupied
for
the
better
part
of
four
decades
it's
there
he
gained
his
celebrity
molded
his
reputation
and
earned
enough
of
a
following
to
make
a
presidential
bid
possible
now
the
man
who
has
consumed
trump's
attention
for
much
of
his
tenure
is
invading
his
turf
former
president
barack
obama
along
with
wife
michelle
are
producing
partners
with
netflix
their
first
feature
a
documentary
about
a
chinese-owned
factory
in
ohio
was
announced
last
month
the
news
apparently
hasn't
pleased
trump
in
a
set
of
tweets
on
monday
the
president
urged
congressional
investigators
to
look
at
the
obama
book
deal
or
the
ridiculous
netflix
deal
instead
of
looking
at
whether
he
committed
obstruction
of
justice
during
robert
mueller's
probe
later
trump
simplified
things
obama
netflix
he
wrote
after
insisting
without
evidence
he
was
due
to
lose
billions
of
dollars
as
president
trump's
america
is
the
unspoken
focus
of
obamas
first
netflix
feature
in
neither
of
his
tweets
did
trump
specify
what
wrongdoing
might
have
occurred
in
obama's
arrangement
with
netflix
nor
his
memoir
deal
with
random
house
which
was
announced
in
obama's
office
declined
to
comment
but
the
fresh
criticism
amounts
to
the
latest
evidence
of
trump's
lingering
fixation
on
obama
who
he's
met
in
person
only
once
since
inauguration
day
he's
accused
him
of
spying
on
his
trump
tower
campaign
office
he
blames
him
for
a
host
of
foreign
policy
debacles
from
the
middle
east
to
north
korea
and
he's
claimed
his
trade
policies
put
america
on
its
heels
that's
not
to
mention
the
birther
conspiracy
trump
fueled
years
before
vying
for
the
presidency
himself
a
racist
lie
he
propagated
using
regular
appearances
on
fox
news
and
other
television
programs
his
indignation
only
deepened
when
obama
made
fun
of
him
during
a
white
house
correspondents
dinner
speech
and
television
cameras
found
trump
scowling
in
the
audience
at
the
same
time
trump
has
sought
to
dismantle
some
of
obama's
chief
accomplishments
including
on
environmental
protections
and
health
care
he
boasted
on
twitter
monday
about
outpacing
obama's
judicial
appointments
an
effort
mainly
fueled
by
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
who
has
pushed
trump's
nominees
through
in
the
absence
of
major
legislation
home
turf
for
trump
donald
trump
is
producing
the
greatest
reality
show
ever
in
going
after
obama's
post-presidency
business
arrangements
with
netflix
and
random
house
trump
is
delving
into
two
arenas
television
deals
and
book
publishing
he
knows
well
his
book
art
of
the
deal
and
nbc
reality
series
the
apprentice
were
critical
in
creating
the
exaggerated
image
of
a
billionaire
businessman
that
helped
propel
him
to
the
white
house
he
remains
an
avid
television
consumer
watching
hours
of
cable
news
a
day
though
isn't
known
to
read
much
he
in
very
many
ways
used
television
to
become
president
but
then
tv
kind
of
became
the
president
because
what
he
was
seeing
on
tv
set
his
agenda
and
controlled
his
mood
and
determined
the
world
that
the
rest
of
us
would
live
in
new
york
times
chief
television
critic
james
poniewozik
whose
book
audience
of
one
donald
trump

and
the
fracturing
of
america
came
out
last
week
told
cnn's
brian
stelter
on
the
reliable
sources
podcast
trump's
tweets
on
monday
targeted
deals
widely
reported
to
be
netting
the
obamas
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
neither
company
publicly
disclosed
the
terms
of
their
contracts
but
publishing
sources
placed
the
book
advance
north
of
million
for
memoirs
from
both
the
former
president
and
first
lady
michelle
obama's
book
becoming
was
the
best-selling
book
of
and
one
of
the
most
popular
political
memoirs
ever
the
former
president
meanwhile
has
been
writing
his
by
hand
and
it's
not
expected
to
be
released
until
at
least
next
year
the
netflix
production
deal
announced
more
than
a
year
ago
led
to
the
formation
of
higher
ground
productions
which
will
create
a
broad
range
of
programming
for
the
streaming
service
the
first
slate
included
the
factory
documentary
a
drama
series
about
women
and
people
of
color
in
post-world
war
ii
new
york
and
a
frederick
douglas
biopic
adapted
from
a
pulitzer-prize
winning
biography
tradition
holds
the
obamas
aren't
expected
to
produce
programming
that
is
overly
political
a
continuation
of
their
preference
to
largely
avoid
direct
criticism
of
the
current
president
that's
a
pattern
other
ex-presidents
have
followed
after
leaving
office
usually
it's
reciprocated
to
an
extent
by
the
sitting
president
though
past
leaders
including
obama
have
blamed
some
of
their
predicaments
of
the
men
who
came
before
them
none
however
have
gone
at
it
with
the
same
gusto
as
trump
the
president
has
only
escalated
his
attacks
as
obama's
vice
president
joe
biden
vies
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
he's
accused
the
duo
of
agreeing
to
a
disaster
iran
nuclear
deal
that
allowed
pallets
of
cash
to
be
shipped
to
tehran
though
recently
trump
has
expressed
his
own
openness
to
extending
the
iranians
a
line
of
credit
during
negotiations
in
talks
with
north
korea
trump
has
lamented
the
nuclear
situation
there
wasn't
handled
during
previous
administrations
he
claimed
obama
sought
his
own
meeting
with
kim
jong
un
the
dictator
with
whom
trump
has
developed
a
friendship
obama's
aides
deny
there
were
any
overtures
to
kim
the
only
time
the
men
met
for
substantive
talks
was
at
the
white
house
shortly
after
the
election
then
obama
warned
trump
that
north
korea
could
prove
to
be
his
most
intractable
problem
but
trump
has
enhanced
that
warning
to
claim
obama
advised
him
he'd
be
at
war
with
the
country
before
long
since
that
meeting
in
the
oval
office
the
two
men
have
barely
spoken
they
met
in
person
only
once
during
the
state
funeral
for
president
george
h.w.
bush
exchanging
businesslike
handshakes
in
the
front
pews
of
the
national
cathedral
before
the
service
began
