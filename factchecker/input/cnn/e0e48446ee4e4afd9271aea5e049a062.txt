a

had
trailed

saying

trump
refers
to
trade

as
losses

takings
though
this
characterization
is
rejected
by

the

the

it

hefty
sums
from

long
before

imposed
his

as
always
we'll
note
it

hyperbole
current
us
immigration
laws
are
not
even
close
to
the
weakest
they
have
been
in
the
history
of

the

while
we
don't
have
precise
figures
on
how

the

there

there

treasonous
can
be
read
at

slightly
softer
than
trump's
periodic
claim
that

sentence
the
full
sentence
was
this
republicans
meanwhile
have
largely
coalesced
around
trump
but
it's
far
from
clear
that
the
president
has
a
winning
message
for
the
article
which
analyzed
the
state
of
the
two
parties
as
approaches
did
include
some
sentences
trump
could
construe
as
positive
we
won't
call
that
claim
false
but
it's
worth
noting
that
the
article
also
referred
to
trump's
erratic
approach
to
foreign
policy
and
trade
noted
in
its
first
sentence
that
trump
falsely
claimed
that
televisions
turn
off
when
wind
turbines
stop
spinning
and
included
reporting
like
this

republicans
acknowledge
that

divisiveness
has
created
