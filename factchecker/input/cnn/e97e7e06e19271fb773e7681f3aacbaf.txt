the
immigration
court
backlog
now
exceeds
million
cases
according
to
syracuse
university's
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
which
tracks
immigration
court
data
immigration
courts
which
fall
under
the
justice
department
and
decide
whether
to
deport
immigrants
have
been
bogged
down
over
the
years
as
more
cases
are
added
to
the
docket
that
can
be
addressed
at
any
given
time
if
nothing
else
the
continuing
rise
of
the
backlog
shows
that
the
immigration
court
is
broken
said
judge
ashley
tabaddor
president
of
the
national
association
of
immigration
judges
until
we
fix
the
design
defect
of
having
a
court
in
a
law
enforcement
agency
we
will
not
be
able
to
address
the
backlog
in
a
fair
and
effective
manner
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
criticized
the
nation's
immigration
system
specifically
taking
issue
with
the
practice
of
releasing
immigrants
while
they
await
their
court
dates
to
remedy
that
his
administration
has
sought
to
hire
more
immigration
judges
in
the
hopes
of
unclogging
the
court
even
so
the
number
of
cases
has
continued
to
tick
upward
during
the
last
partial
government
shutdown
for
example
the
only
cases
that
moved
forward
were
those
of
immigrants
in
detention
all
others
were
postponed
in
january
the
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
estimated
that
more
than
immigration
court
hearings
had
been
canceled
as
a
result
of
the
shutdown
exacerbating
an
issue
trump
had
pledged
to
resolve
the
latest
case-by-case
court
records
through
the
end
of
august
show
the
court's
active
case
backlog
was
according
to
the
clearinghouse's
report
released
wednesday
if
the
additional
cases
which
the
court
says
are
pending
but
have
not
been
placed
on
the
active
caseload
rolls
are
added
then
the
backlog
now
tops
million
while
a
justice
department
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
to
cnn
that
the
department
does
not
certify
data
from
third
parties
the
spokesman
added
this
report
and
doj's
own
data
further
confirms
there
is
a
crisis
at
the
border
this
administration
is
taking
aggressive
steps
to
increase
productivity
close
loopholes
and
hire
a
record
number
of
judges
to
address
the
backlog
with
our
existing
authorities
while
the
clearinghouse
doesn't
attribute
the
backlog
to
any
one
factor
the
american
bar
association
has
previously
proposed
a
major
overhaul
of
the
us
immigration
system
calling
the
courts
irredeemably
dysfunctional
the
state
of
the
u.s.
immigration
court
system
has
worsened
considerably
since
our
report
that
march
report
noted
mentioning
an
unprecedented
backlog
of
cases
increased
wait
times
policy
changes
that
aim
to
accelerate
cases
without
allocating
enough
funding
overreliance
on
video
teleconferencing
during
court
proceedings
and
possible
bias
in
the
hiring
of
judges
the
justice
department
had
previously
addressed
some
of
the
issues
the
bar
association
report
raised
the
administration
has
acknowledged
the
massive
immigration
court
backlog
and
has
at
times
placed
blame
on
unfounded
asylum
claims
which
have
to
work
their
way
through
their
court
system
this
month
the
administration
opened
tent
courts
along
the
texas
border
to
hear
the
cases
of
migrants
who
have
been
returned
to
mexico
to
await
their
immigration
proceedings
as
part
of
the
migrant
protection
protocols
program
around
migrants
have
been
sent
back
under
the
program
in
wednesday's
report
the
transactional
records
access
clearinghouse
notes
that
the
migrant
protection
protocols
cases
still
make
up
a
small
share
of
the
court's
active
backlog
