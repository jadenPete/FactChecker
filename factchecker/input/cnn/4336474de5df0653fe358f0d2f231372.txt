buttigieg
releases
plan
to
improve
us
response
to
natural
disasters
why
buttigieg
feels
sorry
for
president
trump
cnn
democratic
presidential
candidate
pete
buttigieg
released
his
plan
to
improve
the
united
states
disaster
preparedness
on
tuesday
pledging
to
set
up
a
disaster
commission
within
his
first
days
in
office
and
launch
a
national
catastrophic
extreme
weather
insurance
program
the
plan
which
relies
heavily
on
buttigieg's
experience
as
a
mayor
in
south
bend
indiana
dealing
with
massive
flooding
sets
three
goals
under
a
hypothetical
buttigieg
presidency
improving
coordination
between
communities
and
the
federal
government
incentivizing
communities
to
build
resilient
infrastructure
and
improving
the
federal
government's
immediate
response
to
disaster
relief
why
race
is
moving
center
stage
for
we
can't
stop
all
natural
disasters
from
striking
but
we
can
control
how
we
prepare
for
and
recover
from
them
buttigieg
writes
in
the
plan
we
need
to
do
something
different
and
we
need
to
do
it
now
which
is
why
i'm
proud
to
be
the
first
presidential
candidate
to
propose
a
new
approach
to
disaster
preparedness
buttigieg
will
unveil
his
plan
during
an
event
in
conway
south
carolina
a
town
that
was
ravaged
by
hurricane
florence
in
a
weather
event
that
has
been
billed
as
a
year
flood
event
buttigieg
often
talks
about
catastrophic
weather
events
like
this
during
his
stump
speech
referencing
when
as
mayor
his
community
in
south
bend
experienced
a
year
floor
and
year
flood
within
a
few
years
floods
like
this
should
occur
once
in
a
lifetime
but
with
climate
change
what
was
once
rare
has
become
routine
these
disasters
upend
lives
buttigieg
write
in
his
plan
i
remember
standing
with
a
mother
of
four
on
the
porch
of
her
flooded
house
the
night
before
the
first
day
of
school
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
because
the
flood
had
made
their
house
unlivable
buttigieg's
eight-page
plan
outlines
a
mix
of
federal
government
spending
and
streamlining
efforts
by
towns
and
cities
to
apply
for
federal
grants
during
catastrophic
weather
scenarios
buttigieg's
plan
would
use
digital
technology
to
organize
applications
and
data
collection
fund
community
volunteer
programs
to
respond
to
disasters
where
the
federal
government
isn't
called
for
help
and
fund
the
billion
american
clean
energy
bank
to
provide
loans
grants
and
credit
to
infrastructure
projects
the
mayor
would
also
increase
the
number
of
fema-qualified
trained
disaster
workers
by
building
a
federal
force
to
respond
to
weather
disasters
and
expanding
the
federal
emergency
management
agency's
corps
of
to-
year-olds
responding
to
natural
disasters
buttigieg
has
previously
talked
about
disaster
prevention
by
saying
he
was
interested
in
saving
people
who
have
to
live
on
this
planet
this
is
about
harm
being
done
to
human
beings
and
that
has
moral
weight
especially
when
you
layer
the
fact
that
disadvantaged
communities
are
usually
those
who
bear
the
brunt
of
natural
disasters
he
told
msnbc's
morning
joe
in
addition
to
things
you
might
believe
are
true
in
my
faith
tradition
around
stewardship
of
creation
the
fact
that
the
way
we
treat
the
environment
has
moral
implications
in
that
sense
just
the
fact
that
the
way
we
treat
each
other
the
climate
debate
fundamentally
is
about
how
we're
treating
each
other
