the
white
house
would
like
you
to
abandon
all
common
sense
on
locked
and
loaded
cnn
on
sunday
night
president
donald
trump
tweeted
this
saudi
arabia
oil
supply
was
attacked
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
we
know
the
culprit
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
but
are
waiting
to
hear
from
the
kingdom
as
to
who
they
believe
was
the
cause
of
this
attack
and
under
what
terms
we
would
proceed
the
tweet
was
in
reference
to
drone
attacks
on
saudi
oil
fields
and
seemed
a
very
clear
threat
that
a
military
response
was
in
the
offing
once
the
culprit
became
clear
after
all
the
words
locked
and
loaded
directly
imply
that
weapons
are
uh
locked
and
loaded
to
be
delivered
at
the
push
of
a
button
except
it
doesn't
see
what
the
president
meant
by
saying
locked
and
loaded
actually
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
a
threat
of
military
strike
not
at
all
i
think
that
locked
and
loaded
is
a
broad
term
and
talks
about
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
said
vice
president
mike
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
on
monday
morning
which
is
of
course
absolutely
and
totally
ridiculous
on
its
face
so
when
trump
said
that
we
are
locked
and
loaded
depending
on
verification
what
he
was
talking
about
was
the
realities
that
we're
all
far
safer
and
more
secure
domestically
from
energy
independence
come
on
man
it's
not
even
close
just
ask
trump
who
tweeted
this
in
the
wake
of
short's
explanation
of
his
locked
and
loaded
comments
remember
when
iran
shot
down
a
drone
saying
knowingly
that
it
was
in
their
airspace
when
in
fact
it
was
nowhere
close
they
stuck
strongly
to
that
story
knowing
that
it
was
a
very
big
lie
now
they
say
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
attack
on
saudi
arabia
we'll
see
we'll
see
this
is
an
administration
that
has
repeatedly
tried
to
tell
the
public
that
what
they
are
hearing
and
seeing
isn't
what
they
are
hearing
and
seeing
literally
just
remember
what
you
are
seeing
and
what
you
are
reading
is
not
what's
happening
trump
said
in
july
just
stick
with
us
don't
believe
the
crap
you
see
from
these
people
the
fake
news
the
sheer
gall
of
short
to
claim
that
locked
and
loaded
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
military
threat
is
only
possible
in
an
administration
and
with
a
president
who
has
deeply
denigrated
the
idea
of
facts
and
truth
short
feels
that
he
has
license
to
make
these
outlandish
claims
because
the
big
boss
would
say
the
same
rather
than
being
punished
for
living
in
an
unreality
short
will
be
praised
for
it
take
a
step
back
here
and
just
use
your
gut
instincts
let's
say
russian
president
vladimir
putin
was
quoted
saying
that
russia
was
locked
and
loaded
to
respond
if
the
us
continued
to
push
the
idea
that
they
sought
to
meddle
in
the
election
they
did
obviously
would
you
assume
that
by
locked
and
loaded
what
putin
was
doing
was
using
a
broad
term
that
didn't
connote
the
possibility
of
a
military
strike
of
course
you
wouldn't
what
short
is
asking
the
public
to
do
is
to
entirely
suspend
common
sense
here
we
all
knew
the
second
trump
tweeted
the
term
locked
and
loaded
what
he
meant
that
he
was
ready
for
a
military
strike
against
iran
if
and
when
it
became
clear
that
they
had
been
the
ones
behind
the
drone
attacks
on
saudi
oil
to
suggest
anything
else
is
ludicrous
unfortunately
doing
just
that
has
become
standard
operating
procedure
in
this
administration
and
for
many
of
trump's
strongest
supporters
this
is
all
totally
fine
they
are
willing
to
suspend
their
common
sense
in
support
of
their
president
and
it
doesn't
take
a
rocket
scientist
ahem
to
understand
how
slippery
that
slope
is
