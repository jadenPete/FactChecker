said
in

i
am
grateful
that
the
office
of
special
counsel
remains
an
unbiased
voice
in
washington
dc
that
examines
complaints
based
upon
their
merits
instead
of
their
number
of
retweets
she
continued
osc
has
determined
that
i
did
not
violate
the
hatch
act
as
it
pertained
to
my
attendance
at
the
michael
cohen
hearing
as
well
as
my
tweet
defending
secretary
carson
to
the
contrary
osc
decided
not
to
pursue
disciplinary
action
at
all
for
two
minor
infractions
i
look
forward
to
continuing
to
focus
on
the
residents
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
whose
well-being
i
care
about
the
most
the

the
hatch
act
is
intended
to
stop
the
federal
government
from
influencing
elections
or
carrying
out
official
activities
in
a
partisan
manner
and
it
applies
to
federal
workers
as
well
as
state
and
local
employees
who
work
with
federally
funded
programs
the
rule
is
a
workplace
guideline
and
violating
it
is
not
a
crime
responses
can
vary
significantly
if
employees
violate
the
rule
