usda
will
resume
honeybee
survey
suspended
this
summer
cnn
the
us
department
of
agriculture
will
resume
data
collection
for
its
annual
honey
bee
colonies
report
on
october
the
start
of
a
new
fiscal
year
after
suspending
the
survey
earlier
this
summer
over
budget
constraints
while
researchers
welcome
the
decision
to
resume
the
survey
some
caution
that
it
will
leave
a
critical
gap
in
this
year's
data
dennis
vanengelsdorp
an
entomologist
who
studies
bee
health
at
the
university
of
maryland
explained
that
missing
even
one
quarter
of
data
can
undermine
researchers
ability
to
compare
loss
rates
from
year
to
year
one
of
the
fundamental
ways
that
experts
and
the
honeybee
industry
can
use
the
survey
as
they
try
to
better
understand
honeybee
population
declines
it's
like
having
a
gdp
report
with
one
quarter's
report
missing
he
told
cnn
bees
help
pollinate
a
third
of
the
crops
we
eat
including
almonds
apples
avocados
and
grapes
but
populations
have
been
steadily
declining
since
that's
caused
alarm
not
just
in
the
us
but
in
europe
as
well
pollinators
like
bees
are
under
threat
because
of
parasites
like
varroa
mites
widespread
pesticide
use
habitat
loss
and
the
climate
crisis
epa
expands
use
of
pesticide
that
can
be
toxic
to
bees
cnn
first
reported
the
usda's
decision
to
pause
data
collection
in
july
mace
vaughan
a
co-director
of
the
pollinator
conservation
program
at
the
xerces
society
a
conservation
organization
also
welcomed
the
usda's
decision
adding
that
as
long
as
there
are
no
additional
breaks
in
data
collection
the
pause
this
last
quarter
should
not
have
too
negative
of
an
impact
in
the
long
run
vaughan
previously
told
cnn
that
it
is
crucial
for
researchers
to
have
a
thermometer
to
understand
and
reverse
hive
losses
and
that
understanding
what
is
happening
with
honeybees
also
helps
researchers
better
understand
what
is
impacting
other
pollinators
the
usda
did
not
respond
to
cnn's
questions
about
how
much
money
the
agency
had
saved
by
pausing
the
survey
or
whether
it
was
concerned
about
how
such
a
gap
in
the
data
could
impact
bee-related
research
the
honey
bee
colonies
report
is
the
third
bee-related
dataset
to
have
been
curtailed
in
some
way
under
the
current
administration
and
the
move
earlier
this
summer
was
viewed
as
another
step
toward
undoing
president
barack
obama's
government-wide
focus
on
protecting
pollinators
including
bees
and
butterflies
whose
populations
have
plummeted
in
recent
years
this
winter
saw
the
most
us
honeybee
colony
losses
in
more
than
a
decade
the
report
is
an
annual
survey
that
gathers
data
on
the
number
of
honeybees
per
state
by
quarter
including
those
being
lost
with
symptoms
of
colony
collapse
disorder
an
issue
that's
made
honeybees
a
darling
of
environmentalists
and
climate
activists
this
past
year's
survey
results
with
one
quarter
of
the
data
missing
will
be
released
in
august
it's
one
of
two
national
surveys
that
track
honeybee
loss
and
the
only
one
overseen
by
the
federal
government
the
other
survey
run
by
the
bee
informed
partnership
has
been
tracking
data
longer
and
relies
on
grant
funding
including
from
the
usda
to
support
its
work
the
usda
survey
is
considered
more
statistically
accurate
since
it
has
access
to
a
list
of
all
registered
beekeepers
in
the
us
but
it
has
been
gathering
data
only
since
the
most
recently
available
data
shows
that
beehive
loss
reached
its
highest
winter
levels
this
past
year
according
to
the
bee
informed
partnership's
most
recent
report
