kansas

mulling
pompeo
for

kansas
cnn
republicans
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
a
senate
race
in
kansas
the
last
time
the
state
sent
a
democrat
to
the
upper
chamber
of
congress
the
country
chose
franklin
delano
roosevelt
for
president
in
giving
kansas
the
longest
streak
of
republican
senate
dominance
in
the
country
in
fact
in
the
years
since
kansas
became
a
state
only
three
democrats
have
been
elected
to
serve
in
the
senate
for
a
combined
total
of
years
but
with
the
looming
retirement
of
veteran
republican
sen
pat
roberts
kansas
has
suddenly
become
a
cause
for
concern
within
the
gop
establishment
its
worry
is
that
the
party
will
nominate
kris
kobach
an
anti-illegal
immigration
firebrand
and
voter-fraud
crusader
who
lost
the
governor's
race
last
year
only
to
turn
around
and
announce
his
candidacy
for
senate
in
july
in
interviews
multiple
republican
political
operatives
from
washington
to
wichita
say
they
fear
a
rerun
of
last
year
when
kobach
the
former
kansas
secretary
of
state
and
state
party
chairman
narrowly
won
a
crowded
primary
and
then
lost
the
governor's
race
to
then-democratic
state
sen
laura
kelly
who
secured
the
endorsements
of
high-profile
moderate
republicans
the
state's
elections
in
weren't
just
an
indictment
of
kobach
they
were
also
seen
as
a
referendum
on
president
donald
trump
and
the
legacy
of
former
republican
gov
sam
brownback
whose
unprecedented
tax
cuts
led
to
a
budget
shortfall
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
democrats
didn't
just
flip
the
governor's
residence
they
also
broke
the
state's
entirely
republican
congressional
delegation
winning
one
of
four
kansas
house
seats
and
coming
close
in
another
conservative
district
in
august
the
retiring
roberts
told
cnn
he
didn't
know
if
kansas
was
deep
red
anymore
and
wondered
if
it's
now
maybe
purple
there
is
a
concern
that
a
primary
with
half
a
dozen
senate
republican
candidates
would
hand
it
to
kobach
acknowledged
roberts
adding
there's
quite
a
bit
of
feeling
that
kobach's
last
campaign
was
not
a
very
good
race
pining
for
pompeo
since
republicans
took
back
the
senate
in
the
election
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
aggressively
recruited
who
he
believes
are
the
most
electable
candidates
in
the
case
of
kansas
he
has
sought
an
extraordinary
salvation
a
run
by
former
kansas
congressman
and
current
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
on
september
mcconnell
reiterated
on
conservative
host
hugh
hewitt's
radio
show
that
pompeo
is
his
first
choice
a
few
days
later
pompeo
told
the
wichita
eagle
and
the
kansas
city
star
that
he
wants
to
serve
the
president
as
long
as
trump
wants
him
to
be
secretary
of
state
adding
to
take
his
response
however
you'd
like
the
conjecture
follows
him
wherever
he
goes
on
friday
night
during
a
question
and
answer
session
at
the
house
republican
retreat
in
baltimore
a
member
of
congress
began
a
question
to
pompeo
by
saying
they
would
specifically
not
ask
about
a
senate
run
according
to
a
source
present
pompeo
laughed
and
said
that
would've
been
alright
before
continuing
to
talk
about
china
and
russia
pompeo
considering
kansas
senate
bid
for
months
anti-kobach
republican
donors
and
strategists
have
pined
over
the
prospects
of
pompeo
who
they
consider
to
be
the
only
one
who
can
pacify
the
party
and
clear
a
growing
field
of
candidates
besides
kobach
rep
roger
marshall
state
senate
president
susan
wagle
and
former
kansas
city
chiefs
player
and
businessman
dave
lindstrom
are
running
in
the
party's
primary
others
are
also
considering
campaigns
in
a
multi-candidate
field
without
mike
pompeo
kobach
is
likely
to
win
the
primary
said
david
kensinger
a
republican
strategist
who
managed
successful
statewide
campaigns
for
roberts
and
brownback
any
other
republican
candidate
would
be
a
strong
favorite
to
win
the
general
election
he
added
while
kobach
would
be
at
best
a
severe
risk
politicos
have
searched
pompeo's
every
word
and
move
for
clues
to
his
political
future
some
pour
over
his
interviews
others
evaluate
who
he
selects
as
the
interviewer
one
kansas
gop
operative
told
cnn
that
pompeo's
interviews
with
conservative
host
pete
mundo
were
interpreted
as
a
clear
sign
that
the
secretary
of
state
is
interested
in
running
for
senate
since
going
on
his
show
is
a
rite
of
passage
for
republican
candidates
seeking
statewide
office
they
get
especially
excited
upon
learning
of
his
trips
back
home
to
kansas
only
to
be
disappointed
when
they
turn
out
to
be
not
particularly
political
like
his
excursion
to
ihop
to
celebrate
his
mother-in-law's
birthday
it
was
no
surprise
then
that
pompeo's
return
to
kansas
last
week
to
give
a
lecture
on
human
rights
at
kansas
state
university
was
greeted
with
anticipation
and
intrigue
pompeo
wore
a
tie
with
the
school's
signature
purple
and
exuded
the
easy
manner
of
a
savvy
politician
with
state
officials
and
mega
donors
in
the
audience
the
senate
race
wasn't
far
from
anyone's
mind
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
pompeo
said
to
knowing
laughter
i
look
forward
to
taking
questions
on
almost
any
topic
today
the
polite
crowd
complied
asking
substantive
questions
on
iran
abortion
climate
change
and
immigration
but
afterwards
some
seemed
a
little
disappointed
at
the
entirely
sober
discussion
we're
all
anxious
to
hear
from
him
and
say
if
he's
going
to
decide
to
throw
his
hat
in
the
ring
for
the
us
senate
kansas
house
assistant
majority
leader
tom
phillips
told
cnn
he
was
kind
of
quiet
on
that
topic
he
added
keeping
his
cards
close
in
response
to
all
the
attention
pompeo
has
repeatedly
said
he's
focused
on
his
job
but
he's
well
aware
of
all
of
the
speculation
in
july
at
the
kansas
society
dinner
in
washington
dc
pompeo
felt
obligated
to
address
it
with
a
joke
according
to
three
attendees
as
of
now
senator
roberts
nor
i
are
running
for
senate
he
said
going
from
the
country's
chief
diplomat
to
the
senate
is
an
unheard
of
career
move
but
it
would
provide
him
with
another
high-profile
position
setting
up
an
even
longer
career
in
public
service
and
potentially
a
platform
from
which
to
run
for
president
bolton-pompeo
relationship
hits
new
low
as
foreign
policy
tests
mount
pompeo
currently
enjoys
enormous
influence
inside
the
trump
administration
and
is
widely
seen
as
the
cabinet
member
closest
to
the
president
he
is
a
source
of
stability
for
an
administration
that
is
seemingly
in
a
constant
state
of
chaos
pompeo's
position
was
only
reinforced
by
tuesday's
departure
of
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
the
relationship
between
bolton
and
pompeo
had
grown
so
tense
lately
that
the
two
rarely
spoke
to
each
other
outside
formal
meetings
still
people
close
to
pompeo
have
said
a
senate
campaign
is
on
the
table
a
state
department
spokesperson
declined
to
comment
for
this
article
in
interviews
with
cnn
some
top
officials
in
kansas
said
they
thought
pompeo
is
seriously
considering
it
former
republican
governor
jeff
colyer
said
i
know
he's
looking
at
it
calling
a
run
a
distinct
possibility
alan
cobb
president
and
ceo
of
the
kansas
chamber
of
commerce
is
waiting
for
his
friend
pompeo
to
make
his
decision
before
deciding
whether
to
run
himself
cobb
said
he'll
probably
make
his
decision
in
the
next
thirty
days
pompeo
has
months
to
make
up
his
mind
the
state's
filing
deadline
isn't
until
june
the
field
without
pompeo
if
pompeo
doesn't
run
the
primary
could
come
down
to
kobach
and
roger
marshall
a
congressman
representing
the
big
first
district
in
the
central
and
western
parts
of
the
state
while
they're
both
republicans
the
contrast
between
them
is
quite
stark
kobach's
focus
is
on
illegal
immigration
marshall's
is
on
agriculture
kobach
would
pressure
a
resistant
congress
to
build
trump's
wall
marshall
would
take
on
the
white
house
for
its
trade
war
with
china
which
announced
in
august
it
would
halt
its
purchases
of
us
agricultural
products
in
response
to
trump's
tariffs
kobach
wants
to
serve
on
the
senate
judiciary
committee
marshall
has
pledged
to
continue
the
decades-long
tradition
of
having
a
kansan
on
the
senate
agriculture
committee
on
september
a
day
after
pompeo's
k-state
speech
marshall
announced
his
bid
for
senate
at
the
annual
state
fair
next
to
his
wife
laina
and
in
front
of
a
giant
american
flag
marshall
decried
socialism
and
the
so-called
squad
of
progressive
congresswomen
in
washington
dc
pledging
to
not
let
them
ruin
the
agricultural
and
oil
industries
with
the
green
new
deal
while
he
ticked
off
the
typical
party
positions
including
his
support
for
building
trump's
wall
marshall
portrayed
himself
the
heir
to
a
pragmatic
brand
of
kansas
republican
he
quoted
former
senate
republican
leader
bob
dole
mentioned
his
boyhood
hero
was
former
president
and
kansan
dwight
eisenhower
and
committed
to
be
a
voice
for
kansas
agriculture
like
roberts
who
chaired
both
the
house
and
senate
agriculture
committees
the
strongest
argument
for
marshall's
bid
is
historical
as
a
protector
of
his
state's
economic
interests
rather
than
an
agitator
marshall
now
represents
the
same
solidly
republican
district
from
which
dole
roberts
and
sen
jerry
moran
built
the
base
of
their
power
he
hasn't
served
as
long
as
they
did
though
he
displays
a
strong
personal
connection
to
some
in
his
district
after
marshall's
campaign
kickoff
one
supporter
explained
why
he
supported
the
congressman
an
obstetrician-gynecologist
for
senate
first
and
foremost
he
delivered
my
children
he
said
and
then
there's
kobach
a
couple
hours
later
and
a
couple
miles
away
from
the
hubbub
of
the
state
fair
kobach
sat
at
carl's
bar
eating
a
burger
while
dispassionately
explaining
why
he
thinks
some
republicans
don't
like
him
there
is
a
well-entrenched
political
establishment
in
kansas
a
class
that
has
controlled
the
republican
party
for
a
long
time
kobach
said
they
don't
have
as
tight
a
control
on
the
party
anymore
he
told
cnn
he's
running
for
three
reasons
to
carry
the
ball
for
president
trump
on
immigration
confirm
conservative
judges
and
reduce
the
size
of
government
for
which
he
blames
both
parties
right
now
there
really
isn't
a
go-to
person
in
the
us
senate
who
leads
the
charge
on
the
pro-enforcement
side
of
the
illegal
immigration
issue
said
kobach
he
thinks
this
run
will
be
more
successful
than
his
last
pointing
to
the
state's
history
of
electing
both
democrats
and
republicans
as
governors
while
only
sending
republicans
to
the
senate
kobach
helped
write
a
controversial
arizona
law
that
allowed
police
officers
to
stop
people
and
demand
proof
of
citizenship
if
they
suspected
the
detainees
were
illegally
in
the
country
in
the
supreme
court
struck
down
several
aspects
of
it
but
left
that
core
provision
standing
as
kansas
secretary
of
state
kobach
advocated
for
a
state
law
still
mired
in
court
that
required
people
to
show
citizenship
papers
to
register
to
vote
in
trump
chose
kobach
to
lead
a
voter
integrity
commission
which
disbanded
without
finding
any
evidence
of
widespread
voter
fraud
he
has
since
worked
with
we
build
the
wall
a
non-profit
advocacy
group
that
claims
to
have
raised
million
to
build
a
wall
on
the
us-mexico
border
kobach
has
energized
grassroots
conservative
kansans
throughout
his
career
but
his
polarizing
nature
was
on
full
display
in
the
governor's
race
he
won
his
party's
nomination
by
only
votes
over
the
sitting
governor
colyer
and
then
lost
to
kelly
by
five
points
while
kobach
still
has
a
strong
base
of
support
it
has
somewhat
weakened
since
november
said
john
whitmer
a
kansas
radio
host
and
former
state
legislator
who
backed
kobach
during
that
run
there's
a
stigma
of
someone
who
lost
a
race
added
whitmer
the
money
marshall
is
expected
to
have
a
fundraising
advantage
in
kobach
relied
upon
the
millions
his
lieutenant
governor
candidate
wink
hartman
was
willing
to
spend
and
marshall
has
already
reported
million
on
hand
but
this
time
the
kobach
campaign
may
benefit
from
the
largesse
of
conservative
outside
groups
particularly
the
fiscally-focused
club
for
growth
david
mcintosh
the
group's
president
told
cnn
that
it's
his
hope
like
everybody
else
that
pompeo
enters
the
race
but
if
he
doesn't
mcintosh
said
he
could
see
the
group's
super
pac
spending
well
into
the
seven
figures
opposing
marshall
we're
very
interested
in
the
kansas
senate
race
and
view
it
as
an
opportunity
to
get
a
real
economic
conservative
in
there
said
mcintosh
our
view
on
marshall
is
that
he's
not
one
mcintosh
pointed
to
the
group's
scorecard
which
shows
marshall
voting
in
support
of
the
farm
bill
the
national
flood
insurance
program
ethanol
subsidies
and
government
spending
bills
the
club
for
growth
opposed
marshall
has
responded
to
that
critique
by
noting
that
he
votes
with
president
trump
of
the
time
of
course
other
outside
groups
may
align
against
kobach
given
the
result
of
the
gubernatorial
race
last
year
it's
imperative
we
put
our
best
foot
forward
in
kansas
said
jack
pandol
a
spokesman
for
the
senate
leadership
fund
a
mcconnell-aligned
super
pac
we
haven't
ruled
anything
out
to
ensure
this
seat
stays
in
republican
hands
the
trump
factor
another
variable
in
the
race
is
a
presidential
endorsement
in
his
gubernatorial
race
kobach
received
trump's
blessing
a
day
before
the
primary
but
it's
unclear
whether
the
president
will
give
it
again
kobach
told
cnn
that
he
hasn't
asked
the
president
for
his
endorsement
but
said
that
trump
has
been
very
encouraging
about
his
run
while
he
recognized
that
pompeo
could
imperil
his
bid
kobach
said
he
intended
to
continue
running
unless
something
happened
that
changed
the
calculations
and
the
landscape
dramatically
like
polling
that
suggested
pompeo
was
running
away
with
it
in
interviews
with
kansas
republicans
at
the
state
fair
on
a
dirt
road
connecting
the
chainsaw
artist
to
the
pig
race
some
questioned
why
pompeo
would
make
the
move
from
secretary
of
state
to
senator
none
mentioned
the
names
of
the
current
or
potential
democratic
candidates
former
us
attorney
barry
grissom
former
us
rep
nancy
boyda
and
state
sen
barbara
bollier
or
said
they
were
a
particular
threat
yet
the
theory
for
recruiting
him
was
validated
by
mandy
burmeister
a
homemaker
and
gary
white
a
farmer
who
respectively
supported
kelly
and
kobach
for
governor
in
both
said
they'd
likely
support
pompeo
if
he
ran
for
senate
in
drawn
by
his
personality
and
credentials
he
graduated
first
in
his
class
at
west
point
said
white
that's
good
enough
isn't
it
