ocasio-cortez's
endorsement
of

newman
is
an
extreme
candidate

is
completely
out

step
with
the

the
democratic
party
and
our
country
cannot
afford
an
obstructionist

the
left
when
we
need
to
focus
on
wining
this
next
election
and
passing
policies
that
will
truly
help
working
families
and
all
who
are
struggling
in
