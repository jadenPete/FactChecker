trump's
complex
relationship
with
guns
cnn
the
white
house
and
capitol
hill
are
considering
a
phone
app
connected
to
the
national
instant
criminal
background
checks
nics
as
one
of
the
options
in
their
discussions
for
plans
to
reduce
gun
violence
according
to
a
senate
source
and
a
person
familiar
with
the
talks
the
proposed
app
would
be
used
for
background
checks
using
private
sales
and
not
for
purchases
involving
commercial
dealers
one
of
the
sources
told
cnn
the
washington
post
first
reported
on
the
app
white
house
aides
have
spent
the
last
month
meeting
with
congressional
staffers
and
devising
a
package
of
legislative
measures
in
the
wake
of
recent
mass
shootings
the
department
of
justice
also
prepared
a
package
of
options
that
was
delivered
to
the
white
house
more
than
two
weeks
ago
pressure
builds
on
trump
to
plot
course
on
guns
on
thursday
senior
advisers
presented
president
donald
trump
with
summaries
of
the
various
courses
of
action
on
gun
violence
during
the
briefing
officials
did
not
delve
into
legislative
details
and
trump
did
not
appear
interested
in
some
of
the
nitty-gritty
of
how
each
proposal
would
work
the
person
familiar
said
trump
who
has
been
facing
pressure
from
republican
lawmakers
to
specify
his
stance
emerged
from
the
meeting
declining
to
clarify
his
position
on
expanding
background
checks
separately
the
source
told
cnn
the
lack
of
clarify
is
leading
to
doubts
trump
will
back
a
bipartisan
measure
on
expanded
background
checks
from
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
of
west
virginia
and
republican
sen
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
or
some
modified
version
of
it
fact
check
could
a
president
beto
o'rourke
actually
confiscate
assault
weapons
trump
initially
appeared
open
to
expanding
background
checks
following
two
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
last
month
but
backed
off
after
pressure
from
the
national
rifle
association
during
high-level
calls
between
the
justice
department
and
capitol
hill
friday
night
attorney
general
bill
barr
sent
a
signal
that
talks
have
come
to
a
grinding
halt
and
prospects
for
presidential
support
for
expanding
background
checks
appear
to
be
dimming
as
the
week
draws
to
a
close
an
official
familiar
with
the
conversations
told
cnn
according
to
the
official
michael
williams
a
deputy
to
the
president
who
used
to
work
for
the
nra
has
killed
or
delayed
any
progress
on
such
a
bill
despite
support
from
barr
and
the
president's
daughter
and
white
house
adviser
ivanka
trump
officials
still
expect
a
plan
to
be
released
next
week
currently
there
are
no
federally
mandated
background
checks
for
private
sales
this
proposal
reveals
one
important
fact
from
the
white
house
they
recognize
the
problem
of
the
private
sale
loophole
that
allows
percent
of
guns
to
be
sold
with
no
background
check
at
all
we
agree
the
private
sale
loophole
must
be
fixed
but
it
should
be
fixed
in
a
way
that
allows
meaningful
enforcement
not
easy
circumvention
that
endangers
lives
said
kris
brown
president
of
brady
a
gun
violence
prevention
advocacy
group
the
right
balance
was
struck
by
the
house
which
passed
a
background
checks
bill
where
sales
by
private
sellers
are
completed
by
a
federally
licensed
firearms
dealer
to
confirm
the
person
purchasing
the
gun
is
the
same
person
who
is
picking
up
the
gun
and
other
assessments
of
risk
before
completion
of
the
sale
are
done
if
we
want
to
save
lives
and
meaningfully
fix
the
private
sale
loophole
s.
now
days
and
counting
on
mitch
mcconnell's
desk
is
the
way
to
do
it
gun
rights
and
privacy
advocates
have
already
voiced
concerns
about
an
app
like
the
one
proposed
saying
it
could
become
a
de-facto
registry
and
worry
about
how
secure
the
information
would
be
here
are
some
of
the
options
being
proposed
in
discussions

to
