acting
spy
chief
refuses
to
comply
with
house
intel
panel
subpoena
washington
cnn
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
led
by
acting
director
joseph
maguire
has
refused
to
comply
with
a
deadline
to
hand
over
a
whistleblower
complaint
to
the
house
permanent
select
committee
on
intelligence
that
had
been
deemed
by
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
to
be
credible
and
urgent
tuesday
night
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
sent
letters
to
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
a
california
democrat
and
ranking
republican
devin
nunes
of
california
saying
the
complaint
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
urgent
concern
because
it
does
not
relate
to
intelligence
activity
the
complaint
involves
confidential
and
potentially
privileged
matters
relating
to
the
interests
of
other
stakeholders
within
the
executive
branch
a
copy
of
the
letter
obtained
by
cnn
says
adding
that
complying
with
the
committee's
requests
will
necessarily
require
appropriate
consultations
in
the
letter
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
reveals
that
the
complaint
does
not
involve
anyone
in
the
intelligence
community
but
rather
stakeholders
within
the
executive
branch
as
a
result
its
lawyer
argues
the
complaint
is
not
of
urgent
concern
to
them
the
office
says
it
plans
to
work
with
the
house
intelligence
committee
but
given
that
executive
branch
members
are
involved
there
are
confidential
and
potentially
privileged
matters
that
will
necessarily
require
appropriate
consultations
maguire
won't
appear
at
thursday
hearing
schiff's
subpoena
was
issued
friday
evening
and
the
national
intelligence
director's
office
says
that
wasn't
enough
time
to
comply
maguire
will
also
not
appear
at
a
scheduled
congressional
hearing
on
thursday
his
office
says
he
is
not
available
on
such
short
notice
in
response
schiff
said
the
ic
ig
determined
that
the
complaint
is
both
credible
and
urgent
which
is
why
the
committee
must
move
quickly
the
committee's
position
is
clear
the
acting
dni
can
either
provide
the
complaint
as
required
under
the
law
or
he
will
be
required
to
come
before
the
committee
to
tell
the
public
why
he
is
not
following
the
clear
letter
of
the
law
including
whether
the
white
house
or
the
attorney
general
are
directing
him
to
do
so
he
has
yet
to
provide
the
complaint
in
response
to
the
committee's
subpoena
so
i
expect
him
to
appear
on
thursday
under
subpoena
if
necessary
national
intelligence
chief
faces
deadline
to
turn
over
whistleblower
complaint
schiff
said
on
cnn's
anderson
cooper
on
monday
night
that
he
had
issued
a
subpoena
to
maguire
after
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general
found
the
complaint
to
be
credible
and
of
urgent
concern
conditions
that
he
argues
require
congressional
notification
specifically
schiff
is
demanding
that
maguire
turn
over
the
intelligence
community
inspector
general's
determination
and
all
records
pertaining
to
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
odni
involvement
in
this
matter
including
any
and
all
correspondence
with
other
executive
branch
actors
such
as
the
white
house
according
to
last
week's
news
release
from
the
congressman's
office
schiff
has
argued
that
the
acting
director
of
national
intelligence
has
already
taken
unprecedented
steps
to
withhold
the
complaint
from
congress
a
director
of
national
intelligence
has
never
prevented
a
properly
submitted
whistleblower
complaint
that
the
ic
ig
determined
to
be
credible
and
urgent
from
being
provided
to
the
congressional
intelligence
committees
never
this
raises
serious
concerns
about
whether
white
house
department
of
justice
or
other
executive
branch
officials
are
trying
to
prevent
a
legitimate
whistleblower
complaint
from
reaching
its
intended
recipient
the
congress
in
order
to
cover
up
serious
misconduct
he
wrote
in
a
statement
released
last
week
schiff
also
argued
that
maguire
had
acted
outside
the
authority
of
his
post
by
consulting
with
the
department
of
justice
about
the
complaint
as
he
involved
another
entity
within
the
executive
branch
in
the
handling
of
a
whistleblower
complaint
legal
experts
say
the
relevant
legal
statute
has
long
been
a
point
of
contention
between
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
the
executive
branch
in
both
republican
and
democratic
administrations
has
consistently
taken
the
view
that
it
has
the
right
to
control
whether
and
how
congress
receives
classified
or
otherwise
privileged
information
from
the
executive
branch
and
its
employees
even
when
those
employees
are
whistleblowers
whose
complaints
are
made
under
statutory
authority
said
jamil
n.
jaffer
the
founder
and
executive
director
of
the
national
security
institute
at
george
mason
university's
antonin
scalia
law
school
at
the
same
time
congress
has
long
taken
the
view
that
its
independent
constitutional
oversight
and
other
authorities
including
the
authority
to
legislate
and
appropriate
funds
requires
it
to
have
access
to
all
types
of
classified
and
otherwise
privileged
information
and
that
it
can
authorize
whistleblowers
to
provide
information
directly
to
congress
under
certain
circumstances
as
the
relevant
statute
permits
he
added
schiff
said
monday
that
he
does
not
know
the
exact
nature
of
the
complaint
as
he
has
not
yet
received
the
details
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
nor
the
identity
of
the
whistleblower
he
declined
to
say
whether
he
has
been
contacted
by
the
whistleblower
or
their
legal
representation
saying
he
wouldn't
want
to
jeopardize
them
limited
options
the
whistleblower
however
is
presumably
aware
of
details
related
to
the
complaint
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
situation
told
cnn
on
tuesday
that
legal
counsel
for
the
unknown
individual
is
discussing
next
steps
however
the
options
appear
to
be
limited
a
source
familiar
with
the
case
told
cnn
that
the
intelligence
community
whistleblowers
protection
act
likely
only
offers
one
real
path
forward
circumventing
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
and
giving
the
complaint
directly
to
the
committee
that
route
may
also
be
complicated
the
source
warned
noting
it
could
raise
classification
issues
tied
to
transmitting
the
material
at
the
end
of
the
day
because
the
relevant
statute
doesn't
clearly
permit
the
whistleblower
to
go
directly
to
congress
in
the
exact
circumstances
in
play
here
although
there
are
arguments
he
or
she
might
make
this
is
likely
to
come
down
to
a
battle
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
and
likely
will
result
in
another
subpoena
another
contempt
proceeding
and
then
more
litigation
in
the
courts
that
could
go
on
for
years
said
jaffer
who
also
served
as
senior
counsel
for
the
house
permanent
select
committee
on
intelligence
because
the
courts
are
likely
to
take
a
long
time
to
act
and
may
actually
decline
to
get
involved
due
to
the
political
nature
of
the
dispute
and
the
potential
national
security
issues
in
play
congress
is
likely
to
be
left
to
other
fairly
limited
tools
to
force
the
president
and
his
team
to
do
what
it
wants
including
applying
public
pressure
threatening
to
hold
up
acting
dni
maguire's
confirmation
as
dni
threatening
to
impeach
maguire
and
cutting
off
funding
the
administration
wants
he
told
cnn
