trump
wages
more
war
on
california
cnn
imposing
their
will
over
states
might
be
what
all
presidents
do
but
president
donald
trump
specifically
promised
in
his
inaugural
address
to
take
power
away
from
washington
and
give
it
back
to
the
people
instead
he's
trying
to
take
power
away
from
places
full
of
people
who
don't
like
him
and
give
it
to
those
who
do
trump
who's
visiting
california
on
a
fundraising
trip
announced
wednesday
that
he
is
revoking
a
special
status
the
state
gets
under
the
clean
air
act
in
an
effort
to
nuke
fuel
economy
standards
set
by
sacramento
creating
a
situation
where
the
president
of
a
party
that
has
long
built
itself
around
a
message
of
freeing
states
from
the
yoke
of
federal
oversight
is
trying
to
impose
his
will
and
his
policy
on
every
state
in
the
union
california
as
epicenter
of
the
resistance
gets
special
attention
from
trump
who
also
this
week
criticized
the
state
for
its
homelessness
problem
a
month
ago
he
blamed
hollywood
for
an
epidemic
of
mass
shootings
he
refuses
to
utter
the
term
climate
change
but
that
issue
has
animated
much
of
the
state's
policies
in
recent
years
trump
has
made
clear
he
doesn't
care
about
climate
and
california
has
fought
him
every
step
of
the
way
this
is
the
stuff
lawsuits
are
made
of
he
pledged
to
withdraw
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
a
global
deal
to
curb
emissions
and
has
sought
to
increase
fossil
fuel
output
by
fracking
on
public
lands
and
drilling
offshore
moves
that
have
pushed
the
us
to
the
forefront
of
global
production
he's
greenlit
new
pipelines
and
now
he's
rolling
back
regulations
meant
to
make
cars
and
trucks
more
fuel
efficient
we
embrace
federalism
and
the
role
of
the
states
but
federalism
does
not
mean
that
one
state
can
dictate
standards
for
the
nation
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
in
a
speech
tuesday
at
the
national
automobile
dealers
association
teasing
the
move
against
california's
fuel
economy
certainly
the
golden
state
will
see
them
in
court
over
this
new
fuel
economy
attack
the
clean
air
act
mentions
california
by
name
and
gives
the
state
authority
to
set
its
own
standards
as
long
as
they
aren't
less
stringent
than
federal
ones
the
obama
administration
had
granted
california
a
waiver
under
the
clean
air
act
after
the
bush
administration
had
rejected
it
now
the
trump
administration
wants
to
cancel
it
altogether
the
law
specifically
grants
california
the
ability
to
set
its
own
standard
because
it
had
been
a
leader
in
dealing
with
its
unique
air
pollution
issues
california
won't
ever
wait
for
permission
from
washington
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
children
and
families
said
california
gov
gavin
newsom
in
a
statement
we
will
fight
this
latest
attempt
and
defend
our
clean
car
standards
he
was
more
blunt
on
twitter
today's
actions
represent
another
act
in
donald
trump's
political
theater
a
failed
attempt
to
assert
power
a
continuation
of
a
political
vendetta
against
ca
and
our
progress
bad
news
for
him
we
will
prevail
see
you
in
court
that's
important
trump's
efforts
to
remake
the
courts
have
been
his
greatest
success
as
president
he's
picked
fights
with
judges
he
regards
as
too
liberal
since
even
before
he
was
elected
and
lately
he's
made
clear
that
the
drive
to
replace
judges
with
ideologically
sympathetic
jurists
from
justice
brett
kavanaugh
on
down
to
federal
district
courts
is
a
key
reason
for
conservatives
to
reelect
him
liberals
newly
inflamed
by
allegations
that
continue
to
swirl
around
kavanaugh
have
taken
the
exact
opposite
tack
but
the
fuel
standards
issue
also
lets
him
take
aim
at
liberal
priorities
trump's
argument
is
that
fuel-efficient
cars
aren't
safe
a
statement
that
isn't
supported
by
the
facts
in
a
series
of
tweets
he
argued
that
cars
will
get
safer
presumably
because
they'll
be
bigger
but
also
cheaper
because
they
won't
have
to
be
as
efficient
and
because
they're
cheaper
he
said
more
people
would
buy
new
cars
here's
how
trump
put
it
the
trump
administration
is
revoking
california's
federal
waiver
on
emissions
in
order
to
produce
far
less
expensive
cars
for
the
consumer
while
at
the
same
time
making
the
cars
substantially
safer
this
will
lead
to
more
production
because
of
this
pricing
and
safety
advantage
and
also
due
to
the
fact
that
older
highly
polluting
cars
will
be
replaced
by
new
extremely
environmentally
friendly
cars
there
will
be
very
little
difference
in
emissions
between
the
california
standard
and
the
new
u.s.
standard
but
the
cars
will
be
far
safer
and
much
less
expensive
many
more
cars
will
be
produced
under
the
new
and
uniform
standard
meaning
significantly
more
jobs
jobs
jobs
automakers
should
seize
this
opportunity
because
without
this
alternative
to
california
you
will
be
out
of
business
the
words
he
didn't
mention
were
climate
change
which
even
his
epa
says
will
cost
lives
not
only
does
trump
not
want
the
federal
government
to
do
anything
about
climate
change
something
he
doesn't
believe
exists
but
he's
going
to
fight
to
keep
anybody
else
from
doing
anything
about
it
either
the
transportation
sector
is
the
largest
single
source
of
greenhouse
gases
emitted
by
the
united
states
and
tailpipe
emissions
from
passenger
vehicles
account
for
more
than
half
of
its
emissions
when
the
trump
administration
made
clear
it
had
zero
interest
in
lowering
us
carbon
emissions
california
stepped
into
the
void
making
the
state's
government
the
country's
leader
on
addressing
climate
change
trump's
administration
has
worked
to
scrap
fuel
economy
standards
set
by
the
obama
administration
that
would
have
mandated
car
companies
achieve
a
miles-per-gallon
average
across
their
fleet
by
when
trump
took
office
some
of
the
car
companies
tried
to
revisit
that
standard
so
they
could
continue
to
make
the
large
cars
many
consumers
crave
in
this
time
of
relatively
low
gas
prices
but
california
with
support
from
some
car
companies
enacted
its
own
standard
of
mpg
by
other
states
have
followed
california's
lead
a
number
of
automobile
manufacturers
including
ford
honda
volkswagen
and
bmw
volunteered
to
meet
that
goal
a
move
that
has
made
them
the
subject
of
an
antitrust
inquiry
by
trump's
department
of
justice
it
is
not
yet
clear
how
much
the
trump
administration
would
relax
the
obama-era
requirement
currently
epa
requires
a
rating
of
mpg
across
a
company's
fleet
this
is
not
the
only
subject
on
which
trump
is
at
war
with
california
and
other
mostly
blue
states
the
marquette
professor
paul
nolette
has
created
a
database
to
track
all
the
single
and
multistate
lawsuits
brought
against
the
federal
government
in
trump's
and
previous
administrations
while
there
was
a
distinct
rise
in
lawsuits
against
washington
by
states
beginning
in
the
obama
administration
that
numbers
have
soared
during
trump's
term
california
is
a
party
to
such
lawsuits
according
to
nolette's
data
and
new
york
is
a
party
to
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
lawsuits
have
to
do
with
the
epa
but
they
also
concern
funding
for
cities
that
provide
sanctuary
to
undocumented
immigrants
the
president's
attacks
on
the
affordable
care
act
efforts
to
put
a
citizenship
question
in
the
us
census
the
list
goes
on
according
to
a
tabulation
by
the
sacramento
bee
the
largest
portion
of
the
lawsuits
are
still
pending
in
the
court
system
but
trump
ultimately
tends
to
lose
them
according
to
nolette's
data
if
nothing
else
his
move
against
california's
fuel
economy
standards
will
delay
them
until
further
notice
which
in
trump's
mind
might
be
the
same
as
winning
