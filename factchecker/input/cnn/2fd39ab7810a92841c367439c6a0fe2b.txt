democrats
have
spent
years
denying
they'll
take
people's
guns
not
anymore
beto
o'rourke
hell
yes
we'll
take
your
ar-
cnn
beto
o'rourke
did
something
new
for
a
major
democratic
presidential
candidate
at
thursday
night's
debate
when
he
said
very
clearly
and
without
any
prevarication
that
he'd
take
weapons
of
war
and
certain
guns
away
from
law-abiding
americans
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
said
o'rourke
a
former
congressman
from
el
paso
texas
who
has
re-created
his
presidential
campaign
around
the
issue
of
gun
control
after
a
mass
shooting
last
month
in
his
hometown
o'rourke
is
one
of
three
democrats
along
with
sens
kamala
harris
of
california
and
cory
booker
of
new
jersey
to
support
mandatory
buybacks
for
certain
guns
other
democrats
would
make
them
illegal
but
not
require
them
to
be
bought
back
by
the
government
that
was
o'rourke's
position
too
until
the
shooting
in
el
paso
at
the
debate
o'rourke
had
been
asked
whether
he
was
ready
to
take
guns
away
from
people
he
said
yes
if
it's
a
weapon
designed
to
kill
people
on
a
battlefield
if
the
high-impact
high-velocity
round
when
it
hits
your
body
shreds
everything
inside
of
your
body
because
it
was
designed
to
do
that
so
you
would
bleed
to
death
on
a
battlefield
and
not
be
able
to
get
up
and
kill
one
of
our
soldiers
this
is
something
of
a
turning
point
for
democrats
and
while
several
other
democratic
candidates
complimented
o'rourke
for
his
activism
on
gun
control
after
the
el
paso
shooting
none
of
them
endorsed
his
proposal
for
mandatory
buybacks
for
certain
guns
o'rourke
has
explained
his
plan
before
as
he
did
to
cnn's
dana
bash
earlier
this
month
she
asked
him
if
such
a
buyback
plan
would
seem
like
confiscation
and
if
so
galvanize
gun
rights
activists
o'rourke
defends
mandatory
gun
buybacks
you
know
more
than
i
worry
about
the
politics
or
the
polling
more
than
i
care
about
what
the
nra
has
to
say
on
this
i
care
for
my
kids
and
this
country
and
people
who
live
in
terror
every
day
people
in
el
paso
mexican
americans
who
say
i
feel
like
i
have
a
target
on
my
back
i'm
afraid
to
go
out
in
public
he
said
republicans
have
been
warning
for
decades
that
democrats
will
try
to
take
weapons
away
from
gun
owners
donald
trump
said
that
about
hillary
clinton
in
john
mccain
said
that
somewhat
jokingly
about
barack
obama
in
the
national
rifle
association
was
not
joking
at
all
when
it
said
the
same
thing
dick
cheney
said
that
about
john
kerry
in
kerry
was
so
nervous
about
turning
off
gun
lovers
that
he
was
be
photographed
on
a
hunting
trip
to
make
people
feel
at
ease
that
kind
of
pandering
is
no
more
o'rourke
went
to
a
gun
show
earlier
this
year
and
then
endorsed
a
national
gun
licensing
program
like
the
one
the
nra
has
long
warned
against
in
fact
earlier
thursday
president
trump
said
a
new
push
for
some
kinds
of
tweaks
to
the
background
check
system
could
happen
only
if
democrats
don't
try
to
take
guns
away
from
people
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
democrats
want
to
take
your
guns
away
because
there's
a
possibility
that
this
is
just
a
ploy
to
take
your
guns
away
or
whether
or
not
it's
meaningful
he
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
if
it's
meaningful
we'll
make
a
deal
if
this
is
movement
by
the
democrats
to
take
your
guns
away
then
it's
never
going
to
happen
because
we're
never
going
to
let
that
happen
we
will
always
be
there
for
our
second
amendment
democratic
presidential
candidates
and
presidents
have
been
arguing
during
that
whole
time
that
they
absolutely
would
not
but
then
adding
that
they
want
to
enact
new
gun
control
measures
obama
complained
in
that
certain
voters
clung
to
their
guns
and
religion
but
he
also
made
clear
he
respected
the
second
amendment
hillary
clinton
said
something
similar
that
same
year
i
respect
the
second
amendment
she
said
i
respect
the
rights
of
lawful
gun
owners
to
own
guns
to
use
their
guns
but
i
also
believe
that
most
lawful
gun
owners
whom
i
have
spoken
with
for
many
years
across
our
country
also
want
to
be
sure
that
we
keep
those
guns
out
of
the
wrong
hands
and
as
president
i
will
work
to
try
to
bridge
this
divide
which
i
think
has
been
polarizing
and
frankly
doesn't
reflect
the
common
sense
of
the
american
people
obama
appeared
at
a
town
hall
about
guns
on
cnn
in
and
was
asked
by
anderson
cooper
what
he'd
say
to
someone
who
was
afraid
he
wanted
to
take
guns
obama
pointed
out
he'd
been
president
for
years
by
that
point
and
a
lot
of
people
were
still
buying
guns
what
i've
said
consistently
throughout
my
presidency
is
i
respect
the
second
amendment
i
respect
the
right
to
bear
arms
i
respect
people
who
want
a
gun
for
self-protection
for
hunting
for
sportsmanship
but
he
also
argued
forcefully
for
new
gun
control
measures
although
they
all
fell
short
of
a
mandatory
buyback
program
like
the
one
o'rourke
is
proposing
that
kind
of
language
trying
to
allay
fears
of
second
amendment
supporters
while
calling
for
new
restrictions
is
gone
at
least
with
o'rourke
who
has
had
enough
with
certain
guns
