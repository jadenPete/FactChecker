at
the

on

warning

racism
and
white

the
united
states
first
black

barack
obama
hate
only
hides
it
doesn't
go
away
if
you
give
it
oxygen
it
comes
out
from
under
the
rocks
biden
tied
the
forces
that
motivated
the
church
bombing
that
claimed
the
lives
of
four
young
girls
to
those
driving
the
massacres
in
el
paso
texas
charleston
south
carolina
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
and
poway
california
the
same
poisonous
ideology
that
lit
the
fuse
at
th
street
pulled
the
trigger
at
mother
emanuel
pastor
you
have
such
an
incredible
congregation
pulled
the
trigger
at
mother
emanuel
and
unleashed
the
anti-semitism
anti-semitic
massacre
in
pittsburgh
and
poway
biden
said
we
saw
a
white
supremacist
gun
down
innocent
latino
immigrants
in
an
el
paso
parking
lot
with
a
military-style
weapon
declaring
it
would
stop
quote
the
hispanic
invasion
of
texas
we
have
not
relegated
racism
and
white
supremacy
to
the
pages
of
history
biden
who
addressed
a
predominantly
black
congregation
sunday
has
at
times
stumbled
while
discussing
race
during
his
presidential
campaign
biden
has
faced
criticism
for
misspeaking
on
issues
of
race
and
democratic
challengers
including
california
sen
kamala
harris
and
new
jersey
sen
cory
booker
have
repeatedly
challenged
the
statesman's
record
on
busing
and
comments
on
working
with
segregationist
senators
earlier
sunday
fellow
democratic
hopeful
pete
buttigieg
told
cnn's
jake
tapper
on
state
of
the
union
that
biden
gave
a
bad
answer
on
the
legacy
of
slavery
during
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
in
houston
thursday
still
biden
remains
the
frontrunner
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
his
lead
according
to
a
recent
cnn
poll
conducted
by
ssrs
rests
on
his
support
among
black
voters
among
whom
he
leads
by
a
wide
margin
with
backing
him
and
his
nearest
competitor
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
earning
just
support
biden
on
sunday
recounted
the
church
bombing
and
the
impact
it
had
on
the
nation
the
assassination
of
four
bright
promising
innocent
young
girls
preparing
for
sunday
school
the
indiscriminate
cruelty
of
a
stick
of
dynamite
the
appalling
impunity
afforded
the
murderers
while
a
grieving
community
cried
out
for
justice
and
the
nation
watched
it
pierced
us
biden
said
addie
mae
cynthia
carole
denise
their
murders
laid
bare
the
lie
that
a
child
could
be
free
in
america
while
oppression's
long
shadow
darkened
our
cities
and
ruled
our
country
side
biden
gets
emotional
in
an
emotional
moment
biden
talked
about
the
experience
of
losing
a
young
child
later
recounting
the
deaths
of
his
wife
and
daughter
in
a
car
accident
and
his
son
beau's
passing
from
cancer
when
you
lose
a
child
so
young
as
many
of
us
have
experienced
in
different
circumstances
the
loss
is
always
punctuated
by
questions
no
matter
how
much
time
passes
what
would
she
look
like
what
would
she
become
what
would
she
have
done
what
memories
will
never
be
he
said
biden
refrained
from
outright
mentioning
president
donald
trump
or
the
presidential
election
but
laid
out
what
he
thinks
is
at
stake
in
the
nation
we're
in
the
battle
for
the
soul
of
america
and
here
at
historic
th
street
baptist
church
there's
no
more
powerful
reminder
of
what's
at
stake
no
more
poignant
example
of
what
is
demanded
of
us
in
response
he
said
it's
a
battle
we
fought
again
and
again
it's
a
battle
that's
claimed
countless
lives
biden
also
talked
about
the
progress
that
has
been
made
since
the
church
bombing
and
hopes
that
more
change
will
come
i'm
sure
in
the
first
hours
after
the
bomb
exploded
it
was
hard
to
see
through
the
smoke
and
rubble
of
this
church
and
our
hearts
hard
to
see
through
the
smoke
and
rubble
to
a
day
like
today
as
dr
king
eulogized
those
girls
perhaps
not
even
he
could
have
imagined
that
a
day
nearly
years
later
when
the
nation's
first
black
president
would
award
the
congressional
gold
medal
one
of
our
highest
civilian
honors
to
those
young
women
it's
only
with
persistent
effort
it's
only
with
fortitude
it's
only
with
faith
in
ourselves
and
the
future
that
may
yet
to
be
that
can
change
things
that
change
comes
sometimes
slowly
sometimes
all
at
once
and
but
it
continues
we
know
we're
not
there
yet
and
no
one
knows
it
better
my
mom
used
to
have
an
expression
you
want
to
understand
me
walk
in
my
shoes
a
mile
biden
said
those
of
us
who
are
white
try
but
we
can
never
fully
fully
understand
no
matter
how
hard
we
try
biden
concluded
his
speech
at
the
service
saying
my
prayer
to
all
of
us
this
morning
is
that
in
this
moment
when
our
nation
must
again
once
decide
again
who
we
are
what
we
stand
for
we
will
remember
the
strength
of
this
community
remember
the
moment
that
time
stopped
and
then
remember
everything
that
came
after
and
will
choose
once
more
to
fight
for
our
shared
american
dream
after
the
service
biden
walked
outside
of
the
church
along
th
street
with
alabama
sen
doug
jones
behind
a
man
carrying
a
wreath
they
stopped
at
a
plaque
on
the
ground
memorializing
the
four
girls
who
died
in
the
church
bombing
and
