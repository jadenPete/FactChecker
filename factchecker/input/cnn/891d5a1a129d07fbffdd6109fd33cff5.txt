washington
cnn
discussions
around
legislative
fixes
to
mass
shootings
heated
up
wednesday
as
the
attorney
general
returned
to
capitol
hill
to
meet
with
lawmakers
about
proposed
gun
bills
including
a
measure
that
would
expand
background
checks
for
buyers
the
pitch
outlined
in
a
document
that
was
obtained
by
cnn

expand
background

to
all

though
it's
not
clear
whether
it
would
pass
muster
with
lawmakers
the
white
house
on
wednesday
made
clear
that
president
donald
trump
had
not
signed
off
on
any
plan
and
gop
leaders
have
indicated
they
are
awaiting
word
from
trump
before
taking
action
the
outline
which
was
first
reported
by
the
daily
caller
is
a
justice
department
document
in
the
wake
of
a
series
of
mass
shootings
over
the
august
congressional
recess
there
has
been
talk
on
capitol
hill
about
what
if
any
gun
legislation
could
pass
but
on
the
divisive
topic
of
firearm
regulation
congress
has
repeatedly
failed
to
enact
stricter
gun
control
in
the
aftermath
of
shootings
despite
calls
for
action
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
indicated
that
he
doesn't
plan
to
bring
up
any
legislation
in
the
senate
unless
it
is
clear
that
the
president
would
sign
off
on
it
and
it's
not
yet
clear
what
exactly
the
president
would
support
white
house
deputy
press
secretary
hogan
gidley
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
the
president
has
not
signed
off
on
anything
yet
but
has
been
clear
he
wants
meaningful
solutions
that
actually
protect
the
american
people
and
could
potentially
prevent
these
tragedies
from
ever
happening
again
attorney
general
william
barr
was
on
the
hill
for
the
second
day
in
a
row
meeting
this
afternoon
with
lawmakers
alongside
the
top
legislative
affairs
aides
at
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
a
justice
department
official
told
cnn
according
to
a
copy
obtained
by
cnn
the
document
circulating
on
the
hill
describing
the
proposal
states
that
a
background
check
requirement
would
be
extended
to
all
advertised
commercial
sales
including
sales
at
gun
shows
and
that
it
would
follow
in
the
mold
of
background
check
legislation
introduced
by
republican
sen
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
and
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
of
west
virginia
in
white
house
aides
have
spent
the
last
month
meeting
with
congressional
staffers
and
devising
a
legislative
measures
the
department
of
justice
also
prepared
a
package
of
options
that
was
delivered
to
the
white
house
more
than
two
weeks
ago
but
the
white
house
has
yet
to
publicly
release
any
gun
measures
that
it
would
support
some
of
the
options
being
proposed
in
discussions
in
addition
to
measures
trump
and
his
aides
have
floated
publicly
include
allowing
minors
records
to
be
included
in
background
check
databases
alerting
local
authorities
when
someone
fails
a
background
check
applying
bigger
penalties
for
straw
purchases
when
someone
buys
a
gun
for
someone
else
and
helping
states
implement
red
flag
laws
which
would
remove
weapons
from
people
deemed
at
risk
barr
has
been
supportive
of
expanded
background
checks
in
conversations
with
the
white
house
cnn
has
reported
the
gun
package
has
become
a
top
issue
for
the
attorney
general
who
has
explored
the
policy
questions
in
a
number
of
meetings
at
the
justice
department
with
senior
law
enforcement
officials
including
from
the
fbi
and
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
the
justice
department
official
said
republican
lawmakers
react
to
background
check
proposal
when
asked
if
he
thinks
the
barr
proposal
has
a
future
in
the
senate
mcconnell
told
cnn
as
i've
said
repeatedly
we
are
still
waiting
a
proposal
from
the
white
house
and
i
know
they
are
considering
everything
and
since
he's
part
of
the
administration
i'm
sure
what
he's
talking
about
is
part
of
their
consideration
in
one
indication
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
win
a
critical
mass
of
republican
support
the
national
rifle
association
said
in
a
statement
that
it
opposes
the
document
being
circulated
on
the
hill
jason
ouimet
executive
director
of
the
nra's
institute
for
legislative
action
said
in
a
statement
this
missive
is
a
non-starter
with
the
nra
and
our
million
members
because
it
burdens
law-abiding
gun
owners
while
ignoring
what
actually
matters
fixing
the
broken
mental
health
system
and
the
prosecution
of
violent
criminals
the
proposal
met
with
praise
and
skepticism
in
a
senate
republican
closed-door
policy
lunch
wednesday
according
to
participants
who
said
they
held
a
lengthy
discussion
about
all
the
latest
gun
proposals
to
see
if
they
could
unify
around
any
of
them
it
was
a
family
discussion
said
republican
sen
kevin
cramer
of
north
dakota
who
insisted
it
wasn't
heated
but
very
respectful
leaving
the
lunch
most
senators
avoided
reporters
questions
about
the
proposal
by
saying
that
they
had
not
had
time
to
study
it
closely
but
cramer
a
conservative
said
the
proposal
is
most
closely
aligned
with
the
plan
from
manchin
and
toomey
that
would
expand
background
checks
to
all
commercial
sales
cramer
described
manchin-toomey
as
probably
the
furthest
out
from
the
republican
dogma
and
something
his
constituents
consider
to
be
a
slippery
slope
and
probably
something
that
is
not
helpful
the
comparison
to
manchin-toomey
could
spell
trouble
for
the
latest
proposal
because
that
bill
wasn't
able
to
pass
the
democratic-controlled
chamber
in
and
is
opposed
by
most
republicans
as
he
headed
into
the
lunch
toomey
said
he
had
spoken
to
barr
about
the
proposal
and
that
the
attorney
general
has
some
very
constructive
ideas
creative
and
thoughtful
in
all
likelihood
i
would
be
very
supportive
there
are
some
details
we
need
to
flush
out
republican
sen
ted
cruz
of
texas
refused
to
embrace
the
proposal
saying
the
senate
should
instead
pass
a
proposal
from
him
and
gop
sen
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
that
aims
to
tackle
the
mental
health
component
of
the
mass
shootings
crisis
and
beef
up
prosecutions
of
gun
crimes
i
believe
that
the
proper
path
for
the
senate
to
take
is
to
vote
on
grassley-cruz
and
pass
it
he
said
cruz
said
the
entire
debate
had
been
poisoned
by
democratic
presidential
candidate
beto
o'rourke's
pronouncement
at
the
last
debate
that
if
he
were
president
he
would
want
to
confiscate
weapons
sen
john
kennedy
a
republican
of
louisiana
who
said
he
has
a
meeting
later
in
the
day
with
barr
insisted
the
proposal
hasn't
gelled
yet
i
think
this
is
still
a
very
fluid
process
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
doubt
it
he
said
i
don't
think
the
white
house
has
definitely
decided
on
a
way
forward
and
we're
talking
about
it
sen
ron
johnson
a
republican
from
wisconsin
said
the
white
house
and
senate
republicans
are
giving
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
the
various
proposals
that
are
meaningful
and
would
make
a
difference
that's
why
it's
taking
some
time
he
said
this
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
developments
wednesday
