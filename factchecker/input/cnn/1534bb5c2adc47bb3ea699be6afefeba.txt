from
the

of
a

over
comments
she
made
earlier
this
year
omar
was
criticized
by
nicholas
haros

whose

during
a
remembrance
ceremony
at

with
the
words
some
people
did
something
on
cbs
face
the
nation
on
sunday
morning
omar
was
asked
about
haros
jr
s
comment
and
if
she
understood
why
her
march
remarks
before
the
council
on
american-islamic
relations
in
which
she
said
cair
was
founded
after
because
they
recognized
that
some

did
something
offended
some
people
omar
said
she
was
speaking
to
how
the
attacks
affected
her
as
a
muslim
and
an
american
so
was
an
attack
on
all
americans
it
was
an
attack
on
all
of
us
and
i
certainly
could
not
understand
the
weight
of
the
pain
that
the
victims
of
the
families
of
must
feel
but
i
think
it
is
really
important
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we
are
not
forgetting
the
aftermath
of
what
happened
after
she
said
sunday
many
americans
found
themselves
now
having
their
civil
rights
stripped
from
them
and
so
what
i
was
speaking
to
was
the
fact
that
as
a
muslim
not
only
was
i
suffering
as
an
american
who
was
attacked
on
that
day
but
the
next
day
i
woke
up
as
my
fellow
americans
were
now
treating
me
as
a
suspect
in
april
president
donald
trump
tweeted
a
video
using
imagery
attacking
omar's
remarks
but
the
under-a-minute
video
that
trump
posted
did
not
include
omar's
comments
in
context
the
congresswoman
who
was
defended
by
democrats
while
conservative
circles
heavily
criticized
her
comments
said
at
the
time
that
she
had
experienced
an
increase
in
death
threats
haros
jr
told
cnn
on
wednesday
that
omar's
previous
remarks
hurt
me
personally
my
family
and
other
victims
of
families
also
saying
i
felt
as
a
son
of
a
victim
to
step
up
and
set
the
record
straight
on
wednesday
years
to
the
day
of
the
attacks

responders
and
families
