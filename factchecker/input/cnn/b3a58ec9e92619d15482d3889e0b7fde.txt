his

serving
as
special
assistant
to
former
fbi
director
james
comey
the
following
is
an
excerpt
from
his
new
book
crossfire
hurricane
inside
donald
trump's
war
on
the
fbi
copyright
published
by
algonquin
as
the
door
of
the
gulfstream
sprang
open
a
frigid
blast
of
winter
air
filled
the
cabin
of
the
jet
the
hissing
of
its
engines
soon
spooled
down
to
a
faded
hum
and
the
security
agents
on
board
began
making
their
final
preparations
for
our
arrival
they
checked
weapons
tested
radio
communications
and
ran
through
the
schedule
one
last
time
to
ensure
that
every
movement
was
scripted
down
to
the
smallest
detail
during
this
flurry
of
activity
our
main
passenger
sat
calmly
in
front
of
me
nodding
in
rhythm
to
a
john
legend
song
playing
over
his
wireless
headphones
no
turning
back
now
fbi
director
james
comey
told
me
with
a
half-smile
a
nod
to
the
unprecedented
meeting
that
awaited
him
two
dark
suvs
flanked
by
police
cruisers
with
flashing
lights
pulled
up
to
the
stairs
of
the
aircraft
and
the
lead
security
agent
gave
me
the
thumbs-up
it
was
only
when
i
hit
the
doorway
that
i
realized
we
had
pulled
directly
alongside
a
boeing
emblazoned
with
the
word
trump
on
the
fuselage
i
had
seen
this
impressive
machine
before
during
trips
that
brought
me
through
new
york's
laguardia
airport
and
on
one
occasion
i'd
even
caught
a
glimpse
of
donald
trump
himself
barreling
out
of
a
chevrolet
suburban
driven
by
secret
service
agents
his
phone
pressed
to
his
ear
as
he
climbed
the
jet's
stairs
no
doubt
on
his
way
to
yet
another
campaign
stop
as
he
attempted
to
overcome
long
odds
in
a
vitriolic
election
cycle
but
now
as
i
stood
there
staring
at
a
gigantic
airplane
with
the
trump
name
painted
in
gold
i
couldn't
help
but
marvel
at
the
showmanship
and
branding
skills
of
the
man
who
had
just
been
elected
leader
of
the
free
world
for
comey
it
was
now
time
to
meet
the
new
boss
it
was
january
two
weeks
before
donald
j.
trump
would
take
the
oath
of
office
and
assume
the
role
of
commander
in
chief
responsible
for
protecting
the
united
states
against
all
enemies
foreign
and
domestic
comey
had
flown
to
new
york
to
join
his
counterparts
in
the
national
security
community
to
brief
the
president-elect
and
his
transition
team
on
their
findings
on
actions
the
kremlin
had
taken
to
interfere
in
the
us
presidential
election
whether
countering
terrorists
seeking
to
kill
innocent
americans
identifying
cybercriminals
probing
our
critical
national
infrastructure
or
uncovering
foreign
spies
working
to
undermine
our
sacred
electoral
process
the
mission
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
us
intelligence
community
is
a
deadly
serious
one
the
four
men
who
traveled
to
new
york
that
morning
had
spent
nearly
their
entire
adult
lives
working
to
protect
the
united
states
from
foreign
adversaries
they
would
now
channel
their
expertise
into
a
briefing
intended
to
equip
the
incoming
chief
executive
with
the
knowledge
and
tools
necessary
to
counter
an
ongoing
and
serious
threat
to
the
nation
but
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
had
one
additional
duty
that
day
something
the
chiefs
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
the
national
security
agency
and
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
would
get
a
pass
on
for
months
a
series
of
memos
had
been
privately
circulating
among
members
of
the
media
and
across
government
that
contained
unverified
but
explosive
charges
against
then
candidate
trump
as
the
world
now
knows
christopher
steele
a
former
officer
with
the
united
kingdom's
secret
intelligence
service
mi
had
been
contracted
by
a
private
investigative
firm
to
look
into
trump's
background
steele
a
veteran
operative
drafted
a
series
of
memos
describing
information
about
compromising
material
that
russian
intelligence
services
had
purportedly
obtained
on
trump
in
addition
to
outlining
allegations
of
illegal
business
practices
that
might
result
in
russia
having
leverage
over
trump
the
steele
dossier
as
it
would
become
known
also
included
tawdry
alleged
details
of
trump's
sexual
proclivities
and
illicit
acts
conducted
while
in
moscow
at
one
point
steele
thought
the
information
so
potentially
damning
that
he
approached
the
fbi
and
provided
it
with
his
reporting
in
fact
steele
was
not
the
only
one
concerned
that
trump
might
be
in
a
compromising
position
with
the
russians
two
powerful
republican
senators
had
already
separately
approached
the
fbi
director
expressing
their
dismay
at
the
revelations
the
former
british
spy
had
possibly
unearthed
in
november
when
comey
was
speaking
with
legislators
on
capitol
hill
senate
intelligence
committee
chair
richard
burr
r-nc
pulled
comey
aside
to
warn
him
of
something
very
troubling
their
conversation
had
gone
unreported
until
now
there
is
some
material
circulating
burr
whispered
cryptically
it
has
some
disturbing
things
in
it
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you're
tracking
we
are
comey
said
i
don't
need
to
know
any
more
about
it
burr
said
expressing
his
respect
for
the
fbi's
independence
in
addressing
possible
counterintelligence
threats
i
just
felt
like
i
needed
to
make
sure
you
were
aware
then
in
december
senator
john
mccain
called
our
office
and
indicated
that
he
needed
to
come
see
comey
he
brought
with
him
a
single
envelope
the
contents
of
which
were
a
mystery
to
us
as
the
senior
statesman
slowly
walked
past
me
and
down
the
long
walkway
into
comey's
office
he
had
returned
from
the
annual
halifax
defense
conference
in
nova
scotia
comey
later
told
me
and
someone
he
knew
had
given
him
christopher
steele's
material
he
had
read
it
enough
to
realize
he
needed
to
give
it
to
me
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
this
mccain
had
told
him
but
i
know
enough
to
know
you
should
have
it
you
don't
need
to
talk
to
me
about
it
ever
again
thank
you
comey
responded
he
did
not
acknowledge
that
the
fbi
already
had
the
same
material
the
four
intelligence
chiefs
decided
comey
should
brief
the
incoming
president
on
the
salacious
material
one-on-one
both
because
the
fbi
had
originally
received
the
information
and
because
comey
was
the
only
one
in
the
group
who
was
guaranteed
to
remain
on
the
job
when
the
new
administration
came
in
unlike
the
heads
of
the
other
intelligence
agencies
the
director
of
the
fbi
serves
a
statutorily
mandated
ten-year
term
and
comey
was
in
year
three
conscious
of
the
personal
embarrassment
this
sensitive
brief
might
cause
the
president-elect
the
fbi
director
opted
to
discuss
it
with
trump
separately
at
the
end
of
the
larger
briefing
on
russian
interference
as
our
two
dark
suburbans
neared
trump
tower
we
faced
a
predicament
we
were
early
director
of
national
intelligence
james
clapper
cia
director
john
brennan
and
nsa
director
michael
rogers
had
all
flown
into
newark
liberty
international
airport
and
were
still
fighting
midtown
manhattan
traffic
even
with
marked
units
from
the
nypd
clearing
their
path
there
was
no
way
comey
wanted
to
arrive
ahead
of
the
others
and
break
the
united
front
the
agency
heads
had
agreed
upon
and
he
also
didn't
want
to
find
himself
sitting
in
some
reception
room
with
trump
transition
staffers
engaging
him
in
chitchat
something
he
loathed
to
his
core
i
had
learned
this
about
him
early
on
in
my
tenure
as
his
special
assistant
when
comey
was
set
to
join
an
elected
politician
at
an
event
and
i'd
assumed
that
i
should
carve
out
time
for
the
two
men
to
meet
privately
beforehand
to
catch
up
you
assumed
wrong
comey
had
said
dryly
taking
a
blue
felt-tip
pen
out
of
his
jacket
pocket
and
crossing
that
part
off
the
draft
schedule
before
him
in
an
overly
dramatic
fashion
it
wasn't
that
he
disliked
the
person
he
just
had
little
patience
for
politics
i
also
see
you've
seated
the
two
of
us
together
he'd
said
striking
through
the
seating
chart
with
another
stroke
of
the
pen
you
sit
next
to
him
stop
treating
mass
shootings
like
hurricanes
on
our
drive
to
trump
tower
i
asked
the
agent
seated
up
front
to
slow
our
roll
and
he
eventually
found
an
open
space
a
few
blocks
away
where
we
could
pull
over
and
wait
for
the
others
to
catch
up
do
you
have
the
laptop
comey
inquired
the
third
time
he
had
asked
me
that
day
check
i
replied
pointing
to
the
vehicle
behind
us
where
an
fbi
communications
specialist
sat
with
a
secure
bag
containing
a
laptop
computer
that
was
certified
for
the
transmission
of
information
classified
as
top
secret
although
the
fbi
director
travels
with
an
array
of
specialized
equipment
that
keeps
him
connected
to
the
white
house
and
the
rest
of
the
nation's
command
authority
this
was
the
first
time
in
my
nine
months
working
directly
for
him
that
comey
had
ever
asked
me
to
make
a
laptop
available
to
him
immediately
following
a
meeting
this
may
sound
like
a
menial
task
but
comey
wanted
me
to
understand
that
it
was
a
vitally
important
one
aware
of
the
unprecedented
nature
of
an
fbi
director
confronting
a
newly
elected
president
with
explosive
material
about
his
personal
life
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
president's
campaign
was
secretly
under
investigation
for
its
possible
ties
to
russia
comey
wanted
to
make
certain
that
he
fully
documented
the
interaction
in
writing
he
would
later
tell
me
he
knew
it
was
possible
the
president-elect
might
one
day
lie
about
the
exchange
if
it
ever
came
to
light
it
would
be
the
first
of
many
meetings
he
would
feel
the
need
to
memorialize
comey
i
took
notes
because
trump
might
lie
they're
two
minutes
out
the
lead
security
agent
said
over
his
shoulder
whispering
a
series
of
instructions
to
his
team
into
the
microphone
clipped
to
the
shirtsleeve
at
his
wrist
he
advised
us
that
our
vehicles
and
the
three
others
carrying
the
national
intelligence
chiefs
were
about
to
converge
into
one
long
motorcade
and
in
a
preorchestrated
fashion
make
the
short
drive
through
the
concentric
rings
of
secret
service
protective
checkpoints
as
a
sea
of
tourists
spectators
and
protesters
watched
from
behind
barricades
erected
along
the
sidewalk
the
armored
battlewagons
moved
in
unison
along
madison
avenue
turned
left
onto
closed-off
east
fifty-sixth
street
and
pulled
up
to
a
side
entrance
of
trump
tower
before
stepping
out
i
handed
comey
his
black
leather
binder
which
on
that
day
carried
the
document
that
would
eventually
play
an
instrumental
role
in
his
firing
former
comey
aide
fired
fbi
director
regrets
nothing
in
the
lobby
secret
service
agents
held
two
elevators
that
would
take
the
delegation
part
of
the
way
up
along
the
residential
side
of
the
building
there
they
crossed
over
to
the
nonresidential
part
and
took
another
set
of
elevators
to
meet
the
trump
team
the
group
then
entered
a
small
basic
conference
room
the
only
incongruous
item
was
a
giant
heavy
gold
curtain
that
had
been
draped
along
the
glass
wall
facing
the
hallway
puzzled
by
drapery
that
seemed
out
of
place
for
such
a
drab
setting
the
officials
were
told
by
the
secret
service
that
blocking
the
window
would
permit
the
room
to
be
certified
for
the
discussion
of
classified
information
they
milled
about
waiting
for
the
transition
team
and
were
soon
joined
by
president-elect

mcfarland
then
congressman

and
a
cia
briefer
director
of
national
intelligence
james
clapper
kicked
off
the
meeting
walking
the
incoming
administration
through
the
same
intelligence
community
assessment
on
russian
interference
that
president
barack
obama
and
his
team
had
been
briefed
on
the
day
before
it
was
also
the
same
briefing
the
intelligence
chiefs
had
provided
that
morning
to
the
gang
of
eight
a
bipartisan
group
of
leaders
and
intelligence
committee
chairs
and
ranking
members
from
both
houses
of
congress
before
we
had
departed
washington
as
comey
told
me
and
as
clapper
has
since
said
publicly
what
struck
the
intelligence
chiefs
that
day
was
how
focused
the
trump
team
was
on
demanding
to
know
whether
any
votes
had
been
manipulated
which
might
thereby
delegitimize
trump's
victory
rather
than
on
demonstrating
concern
over
the
news
that
the
russians
had
brazenly
attempted
to
subvert
a
us
election
trump's
purge
of
his
own
national
security
team
is
almost
complete
at
the
end
of
this
discussion
clapper
spoke
up
and
told
trump
there
was
one
last
piece
of
information
they
would
like
to
present
but
that
comey
would
prefer
to
do
it
alone
priebus
asked
trump
if
he
would
like
him
to
remain
behind
and
trump
dismissively
waved
him
off
after
the
large
group
filed
out
comey
began
his
prepared
remarks
james
comey
is
not
someone
who
typically
walks
into
a
setting
having
rehearsed
in
advance
his
precise
wording
but
this
was
no
ordinary
occasion
when
comey
got
to
the
tawdry
details
contained
in
the
dossier
trump
became
defensive
cutting
him
off
and
denying
the
allegations
do
i
look
like
the
kind
of
guy
who
needs
prostitutes
trump
asked
he
then
went
on
to
recount
unprompted
a
number
of
allegations
against
him
by
various
women
which
he
claimed
were
all
false
comey
indicated
that
the
intelligence
community
was
aware
that
the
claims
in
the
dossier
were
unsubstantiated
but
that
he
nevertheless
wanted
trump
to
be
aware
the
information
was
circulating
through
government
and
media
circles
trump
thanked
comey
for
the
information
signaling
the
end
of
the
short
one-on-one
meeting
former
comey
assistant
breaks
down
nyt
bombshell
while
comey
was
still
in
with
president-elect
trump
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
not
have
the
luxury
of
making
a
clandestine
escape
in
the
weeks
since
the
election
media
outlets
had
set
up
camp
near
the
elevator
bank
on
the
first
floor
of
trump
tower
in
an
attempt
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
dignitaries
paying
visits
to
the
transition
team
frequently
being
treated
to
impromptu
press
availabilities
with
trump
and
whatever
luminary
he
was
meeting
that
day
i
realized
that
we
had
not
actually
inquired
of
trump's
staff
whether
he
would
expect
the
intelligence
officials
to
join
him
to
address
the
media
would
the
president-elect
with
comey
solo
at
his
side
try
to
preempt
the
classified
document's
leaking
by
taking
it
head
on
and
describing
it
to
members
of
the
press
gathered
on
the
first
floor
a
president
is
permitted
to
declassify
anything
he
wants
but
what
about
a
president-elect
would
trump
be
violating
the
law
if
he
disclosed
secret
information
it
was
a
very
real
possibility
that
trump
would
then
hand
the
floor
over
to
comey
to
describe
what
he
had
just
been
briefed
on
although
usually
calm
i
was
suddenly
nearing
panic
read
and
search
the
full
mueller
report
i
grabbed
one
of
the
trump
staff
members
nearby
and
asked
whether
the
president-elect
was
planning
a
press
availability
after
the
meeting
he
shrugged
barely
looking
up
before
returning
to
his
phone
assuming
the
secret
service
would
be
aware
of
any
scripted
moments
for
the
day
i
walked
over
to
three
agents
who
were
huddled
over
what
looked
like
a
printed
schedule
excuse
me
i
interrupted
identifying
myself
as
a
special
agent
on
the
fbi
director's
staff
do
you
know
if
the
president-elect
is
planning
to
hold
a
press
conference
after
this
meeting
not
that
i'm
aware
one
of
the
agents
replied
is
it
possible
that
may
change
i
asked
attempting
to
gauge
the
likelihood
of
trump
running
an
audible
the
three
agents
looked
at
each
other
and
erupted
in
laughter
seeing
my
quizzical
look
one
of
the
agents
said
i'm
sorry
man
this
guy's
schedule
changes
every
two
minutes
but
yes
as
of
this
second
we
are
not
expecting
him
to
do
any
press
conferences
today
revisiting
the
trump-russia
dossier
what's
right
wrong
and
still
unclear
once
safely
back
in
the
car
i
immediately
handed
comey
the
secure
laptop
he
didn't
say
a
thing
the
first
time
we
had
ever
climbed
into
a
vehicle
without
exchanging
words
but
began
typing
he
paused
every
so
often
to
stare
out
the
window
as
we
navigated
the
city
and
then
went
back
to
his
writing
after
about
twenty
minutes
and
following
a
thorough
proofread
he
handed
me
the
computer
pointing
to
the
place
on
the
screen
where
i
should
begin
reading
i
was
now
learning
comey's
version
of
a
meeting
that
would
spell
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
his
career
and
one
that
would
mark
the
start
of
a
veritable
hurricane
a
torrent
of
attacks
on
the
rule
of
law
that
would
risk
threatening
the
viability
of
our
national
institutions
of
justice
one
of
the
most
bizarre
meetings
of
my
life
james
comey
said
woefully
before
resuming
his
gaze
out
the
window
at
the
passing
cityscape
