no
to
kavanaugh
impeachment

be
impeached
washington
cnn
house
democratic
leaders
and
rank-and-file
members
are
dismissing
calls
to
impeach
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
with
some
arguing
the
house
has
limited
investigative
resources
and
others
saying
it
is
a
politically
toxic
issue
asked
on
tuesday
night
if
she
sees
the
house
spending
any
time
on
the
kavanaugh
matter
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
responded
with
a
simple
no
attention
turned
to
kavanaugh
after
a
book
published
this
week
included
a
previously
unreported
incident
of
alleged
sexual
misconduct
by
kavanaugh
while
a
student
at
yale
cnn
is
not
reporting
details
of
the
accusation
and
has
not
independently
corroborated
the
account
the
female
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
by
the
book's
authors
and
her
friends
told
the
authors
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
kavanaugh
has
denied
all
allegations
against
him
takeaways
from
the
new
book
about
brett
kavanaugh
since
the
new
york
times
published
details
from
the
book
on
sunday
a
number
of
democratic
presidential
candidates
and
lawmakers
have
come
out
in
favor
of
impeaching
kavanaugh
but
house
democrats
aren't
eager
to
act
rep
katie
hill
a
california
freshman
said
she
believes
talk
of
impeachment
could
hurt
democrats
on
the
campaign
trail
i
do
think
there
need
to
be
questions
asked
about
why
the
fbi
had
this
information
and
it
wasn't
shared
she
said
but
i
will
say
also
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
divisive
things
that
happened
during
the
course
of
the
campaign
as
a
sexual
assault
survivor
i
really
could
not
understand
why
it
was
so
divisive
i'm
in
one
of
the
more
liberal
leaning
swing
districts
and
still
my
poll
numbers
just
dropped
dramatically
because
i
was
so
outspoken
against
him
no
matter
what
we
believe
fervently
to
the
bottom
of
our
souls
on
whether
he
should
be
there
or
not
i
know
that
this
is
not
the
issue
that
we
want
to
be
talking
about
just
in
terms
of
election
she
added
i
would
like
us
to
be
able
to
just
do
what's
right
but
i
know
that
for
many
of
my
colleagues
it's
a
really
really
tough
one
pennsylvania
rep
matt
cartwright
also
said
his
party
should
not
prioritize
the
issue
democrats
are
focused
on
the
bread
and
butter
kitchen
table
issues
facing
ordinary
americans
he
told
cnn
i'm
not
saying
proper
oversight
should
not
be
conducted
it
should
be
and
it
must
be
but
if
you're
asking
me
about
priorities
it's
taking
care
of
americans
and
their
everyday
issues
and
rep
jamie
raskin
a
member
of
the
oversight
and
the
judiciary
committees
said
that
democrats
should
seek
more
information
but
it's
not
at
the
top
of
our
agenda
right
now
dealing
with
the
trump
administration
is
like
a
video
game
where
all
of
the
monsters
are
flying
at
you
miles
an
hour
and
so
people
have
to
deal
with
them
as
they
come
and
we
have
to
do
our
best
to
sort
it
out
and
prioritize
our
fact-finding
investigations
he
told
reporters
why
race
is
moving
center
stage
for
we're
in
the
middle
of
looking
at
a
whole
set
of
unprecedented
lawless
activities
by
the
white
house
and
it's
not
that
this
is
disconnected
from
it
he
said
of
kavanaugh
it's
relevant
to
it
i
mean
judicial
corruption
contaminates
everything
so
this
is
relevant
and
we
should
get
the
information
that
we
can
but
we
also
have
limited
resources
