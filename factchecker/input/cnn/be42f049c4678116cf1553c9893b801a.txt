edward
snowden
who
has
been
living
in
exile
in
russia
after
leaking
american
intelligence
secrets
in
said
monday
that
he
would
like
to
return
to
the
united
states
if
he
is
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
one
of
the
big
topics
in
europe
right
now
is
should
germany
and
france
invite
me
in
to
get
asylum
and
of
course
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
united
states
that
is
the
ultimate
goal
but
if
i'm
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
prison
the
one
bottom-line
demand
that
we
all
have
to
agree
to
is
that
at
least
i
get
a
fair
trial
and
that's
the
one
thing
the
government
has
refused
to
guarantee
because
they
won't
provide
access
to
what's
called
a
public
interest
defense
snowden
told
cbs
co-hosts
gayle
king
and
tony
dokoupil
on
cbs
this
morning
he
added
i'm
not
asking
for
a
parade
i'm
not
asking
for
a
pardon
i'm
not
asking
for
a
pass
what
i'm
asking
for
is
a
fair
trial
and
this
is
the
bottom-line
that
any
american
should
require
snowden
a
former
us
national
security
agency
contractor
is
accused
of
espionage
and
theft
of
government
property
in
the
us

of
information
on
american

operations

the

snowden
settled
in
moscow
after
initially
traveling
to
hong
kong
following
his
public
disclosure
of
the
classified
information
the
russian
government
granted
him
asylum
soon
after
and
after
receiving
a
three-year
extension
to
his
leave
to
remain
in
russia
the
country
extended
his
asylum
in
until
in
snowden
indicated
that
he
is
willing
to
go
to
prison
if
he
is
permitted
to
return
to
the
united
states
in
the
final
weeks
of
the
obama
administration
more
than
a
million
supporters

the
white
house
to
pardon
snowden
but
the
administration
said
he
hadn't
submitted
official
documents
requesting
clemency
