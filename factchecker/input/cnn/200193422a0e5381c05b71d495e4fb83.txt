new
claims
about
kavanaugh's
behavior
set
off
trump
and
his
rivals
cnn
president
donald
trump
and
democratic
white
house
hopefuls
have
plunged
into
a
new
battle
over
justice
brett
kavanaugh
because
they
have
strong
incentives
to
put
the
supreme
court
at
the
epicenter
of
the
election
a
number
of
candidates
demanded
kavanaugh's
impeachment
after
the
new
york
times
published
excerpts
of
a
new
book
containing
details
about
sexual
misconduct
allegations
that
he
has
previously
denied
but
that
revived
the
raw
emotions
spurred
by
his
fight
for
confirmation
last
year
brett
kavanaugh
lied
to
the
u.s.
senate
and
most
importantly
to
the
american
people
california
sen
kamala
harris
wrote
sunday
morning
on
twitter
he
was
put
on
the
court
through
a
sham
process
and
his
place
on
the
court
is
an
insult
to
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
justice
the
democratic
front-runner
joe
biden
stopped
short
sunday
evening
of
calling
for
impeachment
but
raised
concerns
about
the
integrity
of
kavanaugh's
confirmation
process
trump
barged
into
the
fray
in
kavanaugh's
defense
relishing
the
opening
to
revive
one
of
the
most
emotional
and
gop-unifying
chapters
of
his
presidency
brett
kavanaugh
should
start
suing
people
for
libel
or
the
justice
department
should
come
to
his
rescue
the
lies
being
told
about
him
are
unbelievable
trump
tweeted
sunday
morning
the
eagerness
of
both
sides
to
engage
reflects
the
confrontation's
potential
to
fire
up
base
activists
and
an
understanding
that
the
fate
of
the
supreme
court
has
rarely
been
more
important
to
the
outcome
of
political
and
culture
wars
following
signature
decisions
on
the
election
campaign
finance
same
sex
marriage
abortion
and
health
care
the
reports
are
reviving
the
pitched
political
exchanges
that
threatened
kavanaugh's
confirmation
most
notably
over
allegations
by
christine
blasey
ford
that
he
assaulted
her
when
he
was
drunk
at
a
party
when
both
were
teenagers
kavanaugh
vehemently
denied
the
claims
new
scrutiny
on
confirmation
process
two
times
reporters
who
wrote
the
book
said
they
corroborated
a
prior
claim
of
sexual
misconduct
against
kavanaugh
they
also
concluded
the
fbi
interviewed
none
of
the
potential
witnesses
throwing
new
scrutiny
on
white
house
officials
and
republicans
who
strong
armed
his
confirmation
last
year
the
book
also
contains
a
former
male
classmate's
new
allegation
that
the
authors
say
was
corroborated
by
two
sources
the
authors
reported
the
former
classmate
came
forward
to
the
fbi
and
senators
concerning
an
incident
he
witnessed
and
said
the
fbi
did
not
investigate
the
claim
the
new
york
times
sunday
evening
published
an
editor's
note
saying
the
female
victim
declined
to
be
interviewed
and
friends
say
she
does
not
recall
the
incident
a
person
close
to
kavanaugh
told
cnn
the
accusation
isn't
new
because
according
to
the
book's
authors
it
had
been
reported
to
the
fbi
and
some
on
capitol
hill
this
person
said
citing
the
new
book
that
some
democratic
senators
despite
having
been
told
of
the
allegations
before
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
did
not
act
cnn
is
not
reporting
any
details
related
to
the
allegation
because
it
has
not
independently
verified
it
a
supreme
court
spokeswoman
said
kavanaugh
had
no
comment
on
the
new
allegation
against
the
justice
or
the
calls
for
impeachment
this
is
the
game
they
play
far
from
playing
down
the
fresh
controversy
to
allow
kavanaugh
to
quietly
repair
his
reputation
and
embark
quietly
on
his
lifetime
appointment
to
the
court
trump
escalated
it
the
president
must
supercharge
gop
turnout
to
win
in
so
is
happy
to
exploit
the
latest
kavanaugh
controversy
to
remind
his
base
of
one
of
his
key
achievements
the
installation
of
a
conservative
majority
on
the
supreme
court
against
fierce
liberal
opposition
the
clash
plays
into
his
desire
to
frame
democrats
as
entrapped
by
radicals
who
want
to
march
the
country
left
and
who
he
claims
are
smearing
the
reputation
of
an
innocent
man
in
their
desperation
to
thwart
conservative
goals
trump
also
is
keen
to
position
himself
as
a
bulwark
against
democratic
hopes
of
reshaping
the
court
in
order
to
appeal
to
crucial
evangelical
voters
can't
let
brett
kavanaugh
give
radical
left
democrat
liberal
plus
opinions
based
on
threats
of
impeaching
him
over
made
up
stories
sound
familiar
false
allegations
and
lies
this
is
the
game
they
play
fake
and
corrupt
news
is
working
overtime
protectkavanaugh
trump
tweeted
a
new
skirmish
over
a
potent
base
politics
issue
comes
at
an
ideal
moment
for
trump
whose
approval
rating
has
recently
dipped
below
a
danger
sign
ahead
of
a
reelection
bid
trump
demanded
that
his
justice
department
rescue
kavanaugh
and
advised
the
judge
to
sue
over
the
book
he
also
accused
democrats
of
trying
to
influence
the
rulings
of
the
newest
justice
an
ironic
comment
given
his
own
relentless
habit
of
publicly
attacking
judges
and
complaining
about
their
verdicts
his
remark
about
the
justice
department
also
calls
to
mind
previous
occasions
when
the
president
has
appeared
to
seek
to
leverage
its
power
to
counter
political
opponents
trump's
foes
were
already
up
in
arms
over
the
department's
role
in
the
kavanaugh
drama
after
it
emerged
friday
that
attorney
general
william
barr
plans
to
confer
a
distinguished
service
award
on
the
department
team
that
worked
on
the
nomination
reflecting
the
unifying
nature
of
supreme
court
controversies
mitch
mcconnell
also
came
to
kavanaugh's
defense
on
sunday
the
senate
majority
leader's
expert
and
controversial
handling
of
nominations
to
the
top
bench
has
done
more
than
any
other
single
factor
to
enshrine
a
conservative
majority
the
far
left's
willingness
to
seize
on
completely
uncorroborated
and
unsubstantiated
allegations
during
last
year's
confirmation
process
was
a
dark
and
embarrassing
chapter
for
the
senate
the
kentucky
republican
wrote
on
twitter
fortunately
a
majority
of
senators
and
the
american
people
rallied
behind
timeless
principles
such
as
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
i
look
forward
to
many
years
of
service
to
come
from
justice
kavanaugh
democrats
playing
catch-up
over
supreme
court
politics
kavanaugh's
confirmation
was
especially
inflammatory
because
it
took
place
against
a
backdrop
of
the
metoo
movement
that
fundamentally
altered
the
attention
society
paid
to
decades
of
sexual
harassment
allegations
made
by
women
in
show
business
politics
journalism
the
media
and
the
corporate
world
combined
with
anger
over
the
defeat
of
hillary
clinton
in
and
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
against
trump
which
he
has
denied
the
kavanaugh
saga
electrified
the
liberal
base
but
also
a
wider
cohort
of
women
voters
who
will
be
pivotal
in
while
republicans
have
used
the
supreme
court
as
a
campaign
trail
rallying
cry
for
years
democrats
have
been
slower
to
exploit
what
has
become
a
pivotal
societal
question
but
the
aggressive
response
to
the
new
kavanaugh
allegations
demonstrates
that
the
left
is
now
just
as
motivated
by
the
supreme
court
as
conservative
voters
as
the
new
york
times
report
broke
saturday
night
democratic
candidate
juli
n
castro
tweeted
that
it
was
clearer
than
ever
that
kavanaugh
lied
under
oath
he
should
be
impeached
the
former
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
called
on
congress
to
review
the
failure
of
the
justice
department
to
properly
investigate
allegations
against
kavanaugh
sen
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
sen
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
former
texas
rep
beto
o'rourke
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
all
called
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
later
sunday
harris
urged
supporters
to
sign
a
petition
calling
for
kavanaugh's
impeachment
warren
complained
that
kavanaugh's
confirmation
was
pushed
through
the
senate
without
a
full
investigation
of
allegations
against
him
confirmation
is
not
exoneration
and
these
newest
revelations
are
disturbing
like
the
man
who
appointed
him
kavanaugh
should
be
impeached
she
tweeted
biden
did
not
call
for
impeachment
but
said
in
a
statement
that
the
new
york
times
story
raised
profoundly
troubling
questions
about
the
integrity
of
the
confirmation
process
that
put
brett
kavanaugh
on
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
place
and
the
former
vice
president
who
has
been
criticized
in
this
campaign
for
his
handling
in
as
senate
judiciary
committee
chairman
of
confirmation
hearings
in
which
anita
hill
raised
sexual
harassment
allegations
against
clarence
thomas
said
women
who
raise
allegations
against
powerful
men
need
to
be
heard
it
takes
enormous
courage
for
a
woman
to
come
forward
under
the
bright
lights
of
millions
of
people
watching
and
relive
a
traumatic
memory
he
said
in
practice
there
is
a
minuscule
chance
that
kavanaugh
would
be
convicted
of
any
impeachment
charges
brought
by
the
democratic
house
given
the
need
for
a
two-thirds
majority
in
the
republican-held
senate
