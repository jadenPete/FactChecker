here's
why
members
of
the
house
gop
keep
abandoning
ship
cnn
on
monday
wisconsin
rep
sean
duffy
became
the
twelfth
house
republican
to
announce
he
would
not
seek
reelection
in
a
telling
indication
of
the
struggles
within
the
minority
party
in
the
house
as
it
grapples
with
a
decided
lack
of
legislative
power
and
the
electoral
uncertainties
created
by
president
donald
trump
although
the
election
is
still
more
than
months
away
there
are
already
four
times
as
many
republicans
leaving
the
house
as
there
are
democrats
as
interesting
only
two
of
the
republicans
who
have
announced
they
are
either
retiring
at
the
end
of
their
terms
or
in
duffy's
case
resigning
before
their
terms
end
are
leaving
to
run
for
higher
office
the
other
are
simply
walking
away
from
politics
entirely
at
least
for
the
next
two
years
duffy
in
announcing
his
decision
via
facebook
cited
personal
reasons
for
why
he
is
leaving
congress
now
recently
we've
learned
that
our
baby
due
in
late
october
will
need
even
more
love
time
and
attention
due
to
complications
including
a
heart
condition
wrote
duffy
with
much
prayer
i
have
decided
that
this
is
the
right
time
for
me
to
take
a
break
from
public
service
in
order
to
be
the
support
my
wife
baby
and
family
need
right
now
which
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
but
it's
also
worth
noting
that
duffy
who
is
in
his
fourth
term
representing
the
sprawling
northern
wisconsin
th
district
had
been
regarded
since
his
election
in
as
a
rising
star
within
the
party
who
had
managed
to
build
close
relationships
with
both
former
house
speaker
paul
ryan
and
tne
president
he
has
been
courted
as
a
potential
senate
candidate
in
he
declined
to
run
and
was
seen
as
a
potential
senate
candidate
if
sen
ron
johnson
retires
in
while
a
statewide
race
could
be
on
the
table
for
duffy
it's
hard
to
argue
he's
better
off
stepping
away
from
politics
for
several
years
prior
to
such
a
bid
duffy's
decision
also
doesn't
come
in
a
vacuum
it's
easy
but
overly
facile
to
lump
all
of
the
republican
retirement
decisions
into
a
single
explanation
like
the
rest
of
us
members
of
congress
make
decisions
about
their
futures
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
and
very
rarely
for
one
reason
alone
but
when
you
look
across
the
landscape
of
the
gop
retirements
to
date
a
few
obvious
observations
can
be
made
about
what
it's
like
being
a
house
republican
in
donald
trump's
washington
and
why
there
has
been
this
spate
of
retirements
being
in
the
house
minority
sucks
take
duffy
he
was
elected
in
the
election
part
of
the
class
that
helped
republicans
take
back
the
house
majority
he
spent
his
first
six
years
in
office
not
just
as
a
member
of
the
majority
party
in
the
house
but
also
someone
who
had
the
ear
of
the
speaker
the
election
handed
power
back
to
democrats
and
ryan
retired
which
is
a
pretty
big
blow
for
someone
like
duffy
ask
any
member
of
congress
who
has
spent
time
in
the
house
majority
and
the
minority
the
difference
between
the
two
and
they
will
tell
you
is
is
the
size
of
the
grand
canyon
as
a
member
of
the
house
minority
you
are
almost
totally
powerless
to
proactively
move
any
sort
of
legislation
your
wins
such
as
they
are
are
focused
on
gumming
up
the
procedural
working
of
the
house
moves
that
the
average
american
has
zero
idea
you
are
even
doing
there's
a
reason
that
following
the
republican
takeover
of
the
house
in
and
the
democratic
takeover
of
the
house
in
two
dozen
members
of
the
newly
minted
minority
party
retired
in
each
of
the
following
elections
trump's
hostile
takeover
of
the
gop
matters
when
rep
will
hurd
texas
was
elected
to
his
border
district
in
the
idea
of
trump
being
elected
to
anything
much
less
being
the
president
and
head
of
the
gop
was
the
stuff
of
dismissed
reality
tv
series
hurd
won
his
seat
by
casting
himself
as
a
george
w.
bush
republican
he
served
in
the
cia
for
the
entirety
of
bush's
eight
years
in
office
someone
who
focused
less
on
party
than
shared
values
he
won
a
considerable
percentage
of
the
hispanic
vote
in
his
race
a
necessity
in
a
seat
that
is
almost
latino
and
he
focused
on
burnishing
his
bipartisan
credentials
while
in
office
most
notably
by
driving
from
texas
to
washington
dc
with
democratic
rep
beto
o'rourke
then
along
came
trump
casting
mexico
as
sending
rapists
and
criminals
to
the
united
states
and
pledging
to
build
a
wall
along
the
southern
border
that
take
on
what
it
meant
and
means
to
be
a
republican
ran
directly
counter
to
hurd's
vision
and
as
trump
has
made
clear
on
many
occasions
he
doesn't
like
when
gop
elected
officials
disagree
with
his
vision
for
the
party
and
he
is
willing
to
punish
those
who
step
out
of
line
given
those
options
retirement
starts
to
look
a
lot
more
appealing
to
someone
like
hurd
electoral
and
demographic
reality
sinks
in
of
the
dozen
republican
retirements
only
one
seat
hurd's
is
seen
as
a
pure
toss
up
based
on
presidential
performance
figures
from
the
cook
political
report
a
non-partisan
handicapping
site
but
in
several
other
places
the
changing
demographics
of
the
districts
coupled
with
voter
distaste
for
trump
makes
for
a
potentially
toxic
political
brew
in
georgia's
th
district
a
suburban
atlanta
seat
rep
rob
woodall
r
won
by
points
in
two
years
later
he
eked
by
with
a
margin
of
just
over
votes
in
texas
nd
district
which
encompasses
major
parts
of
the
houston
suburbs
rep
pete
olson
r
won
by
points
in
that
margin
shrunk
to
less
than
points
in
the
midterms
if
you
are
woodall
or
olson
what
sounds
better
retiring
after
a
few
terms
or
losing
a
hugely
expensive
negative
and
time-consuming
re-election
race
right
again
no
two
house
retirements
are
exactly
the
same
and
all
of
them
are
influenced
by
personal
factors
but
when
this
many
house
republicans
in
these
districts
announce
this
early
that
they
aren't
running
again
and
they
aren't
running
for
any
higher
office
it's
a
telling
indicator
of
the
fact
that
all
is
not
well
for
congressional
gopers
