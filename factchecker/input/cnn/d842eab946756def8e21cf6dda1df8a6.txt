calling
the
foreign
policy
shots
post
bolton
the
move
to
legally
compel
khalilzad
to
testify
in
public
comes
after
close
to
a
year
of
talks
with
the
taliban
collapsed
earlier
this
week
state
department
spokesperson
morgan
ortagus
confirmed
on
thursday
that
khalilzad
was
back
in
washington
after
traveling
to
doha
and
kabul
last
month
to
try
to
secure
a
deal
that
could
lead
to
the
end
of
america's
longest-running
war
on
saturday
evening
president
donald
trump
unexpectedly
announced
that
he
had
called
off
a
secret
meeting
with
the
militant
group
and
a
separate
meeting
with
the
afghan
government
at
camp
david
after
the
taliban
took
credit
for
an
attack
that
killed
an
american
service
member
i
immediately
cancelled
the
meeting
and
called
off
peace
negotiations
trump
tweeted
trump
reiterated
on
wednesday
that
the
talks
with
the
taliban
are
dead
the
abrupt
cancellation
of
the
covert
talks
on
us
soil
came
shortly
after
khalilzad
had
announced
that
the
two
sides
had
reached
an
agreement
in
principle
on
sunday
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
voiced
support
for
the
move
saying
that
trump
made
the
right
decision
it
was
the
case
that
when
the
taliban
tried
to
gain
a
negotiating
advantage
by
conducting
terror
attacks
inside
the
country
president
trump
made
the
right
decision
to
walk
away
pompeo
said
it
made
no
sense
for
the
taliban
to
be
rewarded
for
that
kind
of
bad
behavior
asked
thursday
whether
the
president
had
directed
pompeo
to
tell
khalilzad
to
no
longer
engage
with
the
taliban
ortagus
said
that
the
secretary
hasn't
characterized
it
to
me
that
way
but
reiterated
that
trump
had
said
the
talks
were
dead
