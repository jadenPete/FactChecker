michelle
lujan
grisham
wants
to
provide
state
residents
with
free
tuition
to
public
colleges
a
plan
that
if
passed
by
the
state
legislature
would
add
new
mexico
to
the
growing
list
of
democratic-led
states
to
offer
free
higher
education
lujan
grisham
a
democrat
announced
the
new
mexico
opportunity
scholarship
on
wednesday
while
speaking
at
an
education
summit
at
central
new
mexico
community
college
the
plan
would
provide
free
undergraduate
tuition
at
new
mexico
colleges
for
in-state
residents
and
aims
to
cover
nearly
students
a
year
it
would
cover
tuition
and
fees
for
recent
high
school
graduates
at
four-year
public
colleges
as
well
as
recent
high
school
graduates
and
returning
adult
learners
at
two-year
community
colleges
we're
going
to
deliver
a
major
boost
f-r-e-e
let's
make
it
proof
lujan
grisham
said
drawing
a
standing
ovation
and
applause
from
the
audience
it's
been
a
really
long
time
since
i
crossed
the
stage
for
my
diploma
at
the
university
of
new
mexico
but
even
though
i
spelled
it
out
very
slowly
i
still
know
what
free
spells
and
i
also
know
that
free
college
for
new
mexico
students
is
the
right
thing
to
do
the
program
is
estimated
to
cost
between
to
million
according
to
lujan
grisham's
office
it
would
combine
with
the
new
mexico
lottery
scholarship
and
build
on
existing
federal
grants
to
cover
students
tuition
those
programs
do
not
currently
cover
the
full
cost
lujan
grisham's
office
said
the
state
legislature
where
democrats
control
both
houses
will
need
to
decide
how
to
fund
the
rest
of
the
program
and
will
take
up
the
matter
in
early
new
mexico
state
rep
david
gallegos
who
is
a
republican
on
the
state
house
education
committee
said
he
does
not
support
the
plan
because
it
is
not
sustainable
where
do
we
take
the
money
from
public
safety
public
education
i
just
don't
know
where
we
continue
the
money
he
said
i
think
the
discussion
needs
to
be
had
that
this
money
would
be
if
they
are
graduated
and
have
a
job
that
is
located
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
i'd
much
rather
have
that
discussion
than
just
give
it
to
anyone
for
any
reason
state
rep
rebecca
dow
another
republican
who
is
also
on
the
state
house
education
committee
said
there
should
be
a
work
or
volunteer
element
to
any
potential
scholarship
i
would
support
targeted
scholarships
and
or
loan
repayment
for
students
seeking
degrees
certification
in
new
mexico's
high
demand
jobs
dow
told
cnn
i
believe
there
needs
to
be
a
work
or
volunteer
commitment
to
new
mexico
to
receive
any
scholarship
from
our
state
funds
the
plan
would
make
new
mexico

latest
state
to
join
the
movement
for
free
college
tuition

the
first
