what
happened
during
the
last
debate
cnn
hosted
the
last
set
of
debates
in
july
which
took
place
in
detroit
the
first
debate
night
was
all
about
ideology
warren
and
sanders
spent
the
night
answering
to
attacks
from
low-polling
moderates
like
delaney
and
former
colorado
gov
john
hickenlooper
who
has
since
dropped
out
of
the
presidential
race
and
announced
a
senate
run
both
warren
and
sanders
emerged
unscathed
and
for
them
the
debate
was
largely
a
warm-up
for
higher-stakes
battles
with
biden
that
will
play
out
tonight
the
second
night
got
bitter
and
personal
biden
who
had
entered
the
race
decrying
the
circular
firing
squad
brought
opposition
research
harris
saw
opponents
pick
through
her
record
as
attorney
general
even
former
president
barack
obama
was
a
bit
of
a
punching

immigration
