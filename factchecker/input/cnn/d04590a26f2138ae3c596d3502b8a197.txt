trump
is
trapped
between
two
impulses
on
iran
washington
cnn
president
donald
trump
is
stuck
in
a
political
box
largely
of
his
own
making
on
iran
a
predicament
that
becomes
more
intractable
with
each
alarming
cycle
of
escalation
in
the
aftermath
of
a
sophisticated
attack
on
a
saudi
oilfield
trump
is
being
torn
between
two
political
and
character
traits
that
are
starting
to
define
his
foreign
policy
he's
desperate
to
avoid
a
new
middle
east
quagmire
but
cannot
bear
to
look
weak
i
don't
want
war
with
anybody
trump
said
monday
before
returning
to
bombast
we
have
the
strongest
military
in
the
world
we're
prepared
more
than
anybody
the
struggle
raging
inside
the
president
helps
explain
the
contradictory
twists
of
a
session
with
reporters
in
the
oval
office
on
monday
his
remarks
left
future
us
strategy
opaque
they
also
underlined
how
the
president's
plight
is
the
predictable
result
of
his
own
political
choices
trump
says
it
looks
like
iran
was
behind
saudi
oil
field
attack
perched
on
his
yellow
armchair
next
to
the
crown
prince
of
bahrain
trump
hardly
seemed
like
a
steely
commander
in
chief
locked
and
loaded
for
action
an
image
he
had
promoted
in
a
weekend
tweet
that
put
the
world
on
edge
i'm
not
looking
to
get
into
new
conflict
but
sometimes
you
have
to
he
said
the
man
who
tweeted
in
that
saudi
arabia
should
fight
their
own
wars
is
now
being
asked
as
president
to
protect
a
kingdom
that
won
his
favor
with
ostentatious
flattery
on
his
first
official
trip
abroad
hinting
at
this
dilemma
trump
made
clear
that
he
had
not
made
any
promises
to
the
saudis
but
added
in
a
less
than
ringing
assurance
to
an
ally
to
which
he
has
synced
us
foreign
policy
we
will
work
something
out
with
them
asked
whether
iran
was
behind
the
attack
trump
said
it's
looking
that
way
yet
moments
later
he
rebuked
a
reporter
who
sought
clarification
saying
i
didn't
say
that
after
a
day
of
lurching
political
messaging
the
impression
trump
sent
the
world
was
of
a
president
playing
for
time
keen
to
preserve
off-ramps
for
himself
and
downplaying
a
crisis
that
rocked
oil
markets
could
stunt
global
growth
and
traumatize
the
economy
he
needs
to
ride
to
reelection
if
it
gets
any
worse
trump
sends
incoherent
message
the
white
house
would
like
you
to
abandon
all
common
sense
on
locked
and
loaded
the
same
forces
that
prompted
the
president
to
suddenly
call
off
an
attack
on
iranian
targets
in
june
to
avenge
the
downing
of
a
us
drone
over
the
gulf
of
oman
seem
to
be
in
play
now
in
other
circumstances
the
president
might
be
praised
for
taking
a
prudent
course
in
fully
investigating
the
situation
before
considering
military
options
yet
trump's
aggressive
tweets
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo's
rush
to
blame
iran
forfeited
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
pompeo
further
boxed
in
his
boss
over
the
weekend
tweeting
that
tehran
had
launched
an
unprecedented
attack
on
the
world's
energy
supply
perhaps
seeking
to
create
some
diplomatic
space
trump
sowed
confusion
on
monday
i
think
i'll
have
a
stronger
message
or
maybe
no
message
at
all
when
we
get
the
final
results
of
what
we're
looking
at
he
said
you
know
there's
no
rush
the
choices
before
trump
are
unattractive
reflecting
the
complexity
of
the
presidency
a
reality
he
rarely
embraces
a
us
official
told
cnn
that
the
us
has
assessed
that
the
attack
originated
from
inside
iran
the
official
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
given
a
lack
of
authorization
to
talk
to
the
press
the
administration
has
so
far
offered
no
public
evidence
of
iranian
culpability
in
an
attack
claimed
by
tehran-backed
houthi
rebels
in
yemen
if
iran
is
at
fault
and
trump
does
nothing
he
will
look
like
a
paper
tiger
who
makes
toothless
military
threats
such
an
outcome
would
embolden
iran
and
suggest
that
behavior
that
holds
the
global
economy
hostage
will
be
met
with
impunity
republican
sen
john
thune
of
south
dakota
said
monday
that
while
the
facts
of
the
saudi
attacks
are
not
yet
clear
the
possibility
that
the
us
could
respond
with
force
needs
to
be
on
the
table
to
have
a
credible
deterrent
against
future
bad
behavior
they
have
to
believe
that's
a
possibility
he
said
the
president's
discomfort
can
be
explained
by
the
likely
disastrous
consequences
of
war
with
iran
hostilities
would
confound
a
trump
campaign
trail
promise
to
avoid
foreign
entanglements
us
troops
in
the
region
could
be
sitting
ducks
allies
like
israel
and
saudi
arabia
would
be
in
the
firing
line
and
then
there
is
the
economic
blowback
which
could
imperil
trump's
reelection
campaign
crisis
dashes
hopes
of
us-iran
talks
trump's
warning
to
iran
raises
fears
of
war
and
confusion
diplomacy
is
going
nowhere
either
the
tug
of
war
between
trump's
political
and
foreign
policy
ideals
is
hampering
his
faltering
efforts
to
open
talks
with
iran
the
initiative
already
was
doomed
since
the
president
is
seeking
to
replace
a
nuclear
deal
that
he
walked
out
on
last
year
apparently
confirming
the
view
of
iranian
hardliners
that
the
us
can
never
be
trusted
as
he
seeks
reelection
trump
is
trawling
the
globe
for
big
pr
wins
and
angling
for
a
historic
meeting
with
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
next
week
that
is
probably
politically
impossible
now
for
both
sides
unlike
north
korea's
kim
jong
un
the
islamic
republic
has
no
interest
in
photo
ops
that
look
good
in
campaign
videos
the
iranians
have
made
clear
that
their
price
for
talks
is
lifting
the
sanctions
against
their
country
a
concession
that
would
require
trump
to
offer
the
kind
of
carrot
that
he
never
tires
of
condemning
his
nemesis
former
president
barack
obama
for
offering
some
analysts
believe
that
the
saudi
attacks
if
plotted
by
iran
could
be
a
signal
that
it
has
already
given
up
on
the
notion
that
diplomacy
with
the
us
will
ever
result
in
the
lifting
of
the
sanctions
that
have
pummeled
its
economy
proof
of
iranian
military
action
or
attacks
by
its
proxies
in
the
region
could
also
indicate
that
forces
inside
iranian
politics
that
are
hostile
to
any
dialogue
have
the
upper
hand
the
very
idea
of
a
trump-iran
dialogue
also
seems
unlikely
after
years
of
animosity
there's
no
chance
that
the
president
and
the
leaders
of
iran
are
going
to
fall
in
love
as
trump
described
the
blossoming
with
his
relationship
with
kim
one
frustration
for
trump
who
believes
so
far
with
little
evidence
that
his
personal
magnetism
can
forge
diplomatic
deals
is
the
remoteness
of
the
iranian
leadership
even
talks
with
rouhani
which
would
be
the
first
between
us
and
iranian
leaders
since
the
islamic
revolution
would
not
get
trump
in
front
of
the
man
calling
the
shots
in
tehran
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
sees
the
world
through
a
clerical
and
revolutionary
lens
clouded
by
anti-us
dogma
the
environment
in
which
he's
making
his
calculations
could
hardly
be
more
estranged
from
trump's
brash
reality-show
world
slim
hopes
of
european
help
attacks
have
disrupted
of
the
world's
oil
production
here's
what
you
need
to
know
trump's
unenviable
position
would
test
any
us
president
even
one
not
facing
the
constraints
imposed
by
the
confrontational
path
trump
has
chosen
to
deal
with
iran
one
way
out
could
be
for
the
president
to
use
the
attack
on
the
saudi
oil
facility
as
a
rallying
point
to
rebuild
the
international
front
against
iran
while
european
governments
have
been
battling
to
save
the
iran
nuclear
deal
clear-cut
evidence
that
tehran
was
behind
the
attacks
could
drain
the
political
capital
sustaining
their
efforts
potentially
the
president
could
use
the
incident
to
convince
european
leaders
to
sign
up
for
the
us
operation
in
the
gulf
to
shield
oil
tankers
from
seizure
by
iran
britain
nurturing
its
special
relationship
with
the
us
as
brexit
looms
has
signed
up
but
france
and
germany
declined
amid
a
transatlantic
dust-up
over
trump's
iran
policy
a
us-european
rapprochement
seems
unlikely
however
given
washington's
attempts
to
undermine
the
european
union's
efforts
to
keep
the
nuclear
deal
alive
us
military
action
meanwhile
would
likely
torpedo
an
effort
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
to
de-escalate
the
situation
and
get
washington
and
tehran
back
to
the
table
