messy
hearing

democrats

cnn
tensions
are
building
within
the
house
democratic
caucus
over
the
judiciary
committee's
march
toward
impeachment
with
democrats
again
at
odds
over
their
messaging
and
strategy
during
a
crucial
time
facing
their
majority
in
the
aftermath
of
corey
lewandowski's
testimony
this
week
some
democrats
are
openly
questioning
the
wisdom
of
bringing
forward
the
bombastic
former
trump
campaign
manager
whose
contentious
exchanges
with
democrats
and
stonewalling
of
their
questions
may
have
overshadowed
a
key
aspect
of
his
testimony
that
president
donald
trump
enlisted
lewandowski
to
tell
the
then-attorney
general
to
limit
the
investigation
into
his
campaign
what
has
irked
some
democrats
is
the
failure
to
hold
lewandowski
in
contempt
immediately
during
the
hearing
according
to
democratic
sources
that
may
soon
change
as
the
committee
weighs
holding
him
in
contempt
source
says
conversations
about
the
wisdom
of
bringing
lewandowski
in
to
testify
played
out
behind
closed
doors
between
democratic
leadership
aides
and
committee
staff
in
the
run-up
to
tuesday's
hearing
sources
told
cnn
and
on
wednesday
some
democrats
openly
questioned
the
need
for
the
hearing
if
i'm
sitting
at
home
as
a
person
who's
struggling
to
pay
for
my
insulin
i'm
saying
to
myself
what
the
heck
is
going
on
in
washington
said
rep
anthony
brindisi
a
freshman
democrat
from
new
york
whose
seat
the
gop
is
targeting
in
when
asked
about
the
hearing
it
seems
like
nothing
is
getting
done
democrats
and
republicans
continue
to
fight
it's
a
sideshow
rep
maxine
waters
an
outspoken
supporter
of
impeachment
said
that
while
she
believed
that
lewandowski
was
nailed
when
he
confirmed
that
he
had
been
directed
by
trump
to
urge
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
limit
the
probe
into
his
campaign
she
also
said
the
committee
should
have
brought
forward
another
witness
first
as
it
opened
its
new
round
of
impeachment
hearings
i
think
that
there
are
some
others
who
should
have
come
first
the
california
democrat
told
cnn
i
didn't
think
that
he
was
necessarily
the
best
one
but
since
he
was
there
i
think
that
what
came
out
of
it
was
his
attitude
something
about
his
character
and
the
way
that
he
disrespected
the
committee
democratic
leadership
staff
warned
of
spectacle
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
who
has
thrown
cold
water
on
moving
forward
on
impeachment
told
cnn
on
wednesday
that
he
had
not
seen
the
lewandowski
hearing
so
he
didn't
want
to
comment
but
added
most
people
think
it
was
sort
of
disruptive
asked
if
democrats
could
be
clearer
in
their
messaging
about
their
impeachment
deliberations
the
maryland
democrat
added
i
think
it
could
be
clearer
but
always
the
message
could
be
clearer
but
i
think
the
message
is
pretty
clear
the
judiciary
committee
is
doing
what
it's
constitutionally
supposed
to
do
privately
for
weeks
democrats
recognized
that
the
lewandowski
hearing
could
indeed
turn
into
a
sideshow
but
the
committee
facing
the
white
house's
blockade
of
key
witnesses
faced
a
dilemma
bring
in
lewandowski
and
get
rare
testimony
from
a
fact-witness
of
potential
obstruction
of
justice
but
risk
a
circus-like
atmosphere
in
the
days
leading
up
to
the
lewandowski
hearing
democratic
leadership
staff
warned
judiciary
committee
aides
that
it
would
be
a
spectacle
that
could
get
out
of
control
according
to
a
senior
democratic
source
familiar
with
the
conversation
a
committee
source
insisted
that
democratic
leadership
staff
and
the
judiciary
committee
had
for
months
been
carefully
coordinating
their
plan
for
hearings
including
bringing
in
nongovernment
individuals
like
lewandowski
who
would
be
unable
to
defy
a
congressional
subpoena
on
wednesday
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
spokeswoman
ashley
etienne
said
we
supported
judiciary's
hearing
with
lewandowski
because
he
was
trump's
top
henchman
in
his
effort
to
shut
down
the
mueller
investigation
saying
the
hearing
clearly
demonstrated
the
president
had
acted
illegally
others
acknowledge
it
was
a
messy
hearing
but
argued
it
was
successful
look
these
are
going
to
be
contentious
hearings
said
rep
david
cicilline
of
rhode
island
a
judiciary
committee
democrat
who
favors
impeachment
proceedings
these
are
people
who
are
part
of
an
elaborate
cover-up
in
an
effort
to
obstruct
congress
from
getting
to
the
truth
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
rocky
road
if
people
think
people
are
just
going
to
come
forward
and
sort
of
admit
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
and
go
home
that's
not
the
way
these
things
work
rep
jerry
nadler
a
new
york
democrat
who's
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
acknowledged
the
theatrics
at
the
hearing
never
help
saying
on
wednesday
it
is
intended
to
obscure
but
he
also
told
cnn
that
lewandowski's
refusal
to
answer
questions
adds
weight
to
the
committee's
push
toward
impeachment
citing
article
three
of
the
nixon
impeachment
resolution
alleging
he
had
obstructed
congress
we
saw
a
witness
instructed
by
the
white
house
completely
contemptuous
of
congress
who
refused
to
answer
relevant
questions
nadler
said
just
another
instance
of
obstruction
of
congress
and
that's
what
article
of
the
nixon
impeachment
was
frustration
behind
the
scenes
but
how
democrats
are
messaging
their
investigation
remains
a
sore
spot
among
many
in
the
caucus
nadler
has
been
increasingly
vocal
in
recent
weeks
that
his
panel
is
conducting
an
inquiry
to
determine
whether
to
impeach
the
president
language
that
pelosi
has
yet
to
embrace
at
a
private
meeting
about
two
weeks
ago
pelosi
expressed
annoyance
at
house
judiciary
staff
for
pushing
ahead
on
impeachment
and
going
further
than
many
members
of
her
caucus
according
to
several
sources
some
judiciary
aides
she
said
just
want
to
impeach
feel
free
to
leak
this
the
california
democrat
said
according
to
several
sources
in
the
room
a
comment
first
reported
by
politico
at
that
same
meeting
though
she
also
expressed
support
for
nadler's
handling
of
the
investigation
and
said
she
backed
the
moves
he
was
making
in
court
the
sources
said
she
didn't
rule
out
impeachment
in
those
remarks
pelosi
was
among
those
who
were
frustrated
by
lewandowski's
behavior
in
tuesday's
hearing
in
a
meeting
on
wednesday
a
democratic
lawmaker
commented
on
the
level
of
disrespect
that
lewandowski
had
displayed
at
the
hearing
for
the
committee
and
congress
authority
to
uncover
the
truth
pelosi
agreed
that
his
behavior
was
beyond
the
pale
and
contemptible
and
went
on
to
say
that
he
could
have
been
held
in
contempt
right
then
and
there
however
her
comment
was
a
critique
of
lewandowski's
behavior
not
the
handling
of
the
hearings
in
public
pelosi
has
greenlit
the
judiciary
committee's
language
in
lawsuits
seeking
the
underlying
grand
jury
material
in
the
probe
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
and
testimony
from
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
that
says
explicitly
the
committee
is
actively
considering
whether
to
move
to
impeach
the
president
some
democrats
believe
pelosi
is
intentionally
seeking
to
muddy
the
messaging
in
order
to
make
it
harder
to
impeach
the
president
something
the
speaker
has
said
could
help
trump's
reelection
in
while
others
believe
she's
giving
herself
flexibility
to
please
both
sides
of
the
caucus
it's
all
strategic
said
one
house
democrat
who
is
frustrated
with
pelosi
over
the
issue
the
most
important
thing
to
pelosi
at
a
closed-door
caucus
meeting
on
wednesday
pelosi
told
her
caucus
that
the
most
important
thing
is
winning
in
and
beating
trump
per
three
sources
while
she
didn't
rule
out
impeachment
lawmakers
left
with
the
impression
that
she
wants
democrats
to
tread
carefully
with
impeachment
because
she
thinks
it
could
ultimately
help
trump
to
help
keep
the
majority
democrats
need
to
hold
seats
like
that
of
brindisi
who
said
he
has
spoken
directly
with
pelosi
and
nadler
in
recent
days
about
his
concerns
over
moving
forward
with
impeachment
i
talked
to
her
a
lot
last
week
or
so
about
it
and
i
walked
away
with
a
positive
impression
of
where
she
stands
on
this
brindisi
said
i
think
that
she
wants
to
see
where
the
american
people
are
and
i
think
she
recognizes
that
the
american
people
aren't
there
on
impeachment
right
now
and
we
have
to
focus
on
areas
where
they
are
supportive
like
lowering
drug
costs
but
other
democrats
say
the
reason
why
their
party
won
a
house
majority
was
not
only
on
issues
like
health
care
but
also
on
promises
of
holding
trump
accountable
i
think
ultimately
we
will
move
forward
said
rep
joaquin
castro
a
texas
democrat
who's
a
member
of
the
house
intelligence
committee
others
say
the
combativeness
of
witnesses
should
not
deter
the
impeachment
investigation
from
moving
ahead
it's
not
going
to
be
pretty
if
they
come
and
act
like
that
but
they're
not
going
to
be
rewarded
by
just
being
s
disturbers
said
rep
eric
swalwell
a
california
democrat
who
sits
on
both
the
house
intelligence
and
judiciary
panels
if
they
think
that
they
can
act
that
way
and
we're
just
going
to
say
you
know
what
we're
not
going
to
have
any
more
hearings
because
it
was
a
mess
that's
not
we're
not
going
to
reward
that
behavior
this
story
has
been
updated
with
additional
developments
