the
environmental
protection
agency
exceeded
its
goals
in
cutting
back
environmental
regulations
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
trump
administration
according
to
an
internal
watchdog
report
the
epa's
inspector
general
evaluated
how
the
agency
responded
to
an
executive
order
from
president
donald
trump
issued
in
january
mandating
federal
agencies
control
costs
by
cutting
regulations
the
eo
asked
that
for
every
one
regulation
an
agency
issued
two
regulations
be
cut
the
epa
cut
regulations
saving
the
agency
more
than
million
and
created
four
new
regulations
far
more
than
the
to-
ratio
the
white
house
had
requested
according
to
the
report
the
agency
saved
roughly
million
more
than
the
office
of
management
and
budget
requested
in
the
administration's
first
year
the
epa
had
the
highest
number
of
deregulatory
actions
of
any
federal
agency
according
to
the
report
these
actions
include
rollbacks
of
environmental
regulations
that
govern
water
air
and
greenhouse
gas
emission
levels
in
the
past
two
years
the
epa
changed
what
waters
are
protected
under
the
clean
water
act
rolled
back
an
obama-era
plan
that
would
have
reduced
carbon
emission
from
coal-fired
power
plants
and
proposed
a
rule
that
would
allow
fewer
restrictions
on
hazardous
air
pollutants
among
other
changes
the
inspector
general's
report
gives
a
fuller
picture
of
how
aggressively
the
agency
has
been
in
slashing
regulations
the
data
shows
the
epa
has
been
the
most
successful
in
this
goal
while
the
inspector
general
evaluated
the
agency's
regulatory
rollbacks
it
did
not
evaluate
human
health
and
environmental
impacts
or
trends
the
report
said
in
a
response
memo
the
acting
deputy
administrator
henry
darwin
said
the
agency
is
pleased
with
the
inspector
general's
conclusion
that
the
epa
is
in
compliance
with
the
executive
order
the
epa
has
successfully
and
fully
implemented
the
requirements
of
the
executive
order
darwin
wrote
in
his
memo
the
sierra
club
an
environmental
advocacy
group
did
not
see
the
report's
findings
as
positive
the
epa
should
not
be
bragging
about
cutting
vital
safeguards
for
our
air
water
and
climate
going
above
and
beyond
trump's
arbitrary
benchmark
is
not
an
achievement
it
only
proves
that
andrew
wheeler
couldn't
care
less
about
the
health
and
safety
of
those
he
is
supposed
to
protect
said
matthew
gravatt
the
sierra
club's
deputy
director
for
federal
and
administrative
advocacy
the
inspector
general
recommended
the
agency
be
more
transparent
about
its
regulation
changes
moving
forward
suggesting
the
agency
set
up
a
public
portal
where
people
can
see
updates
about
the
agency's
actions
it
also
recommended
the
epa's
regulatory
reform
task
force
the
part
of
the
agency
working
on
regulation
changes
publicly
release
progress
reports
on
their
work
