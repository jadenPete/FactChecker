daughter's
citizenship
washington
cnn
a
same-sex
american
couple
whose
daughter
was
denied
birthright
citizenship
filed
suit
against
the
state
department
on
thursday
joining
a
growing
list
of
lgbtq
families
turning
to
litigation
to
combat
the
policy
although
roee
and
adiel
kiviti
are
both
us
citizens
as
is
their
almost
three-year-old
son
lev
their
six-month-old
daughter
kessem
was
not
granted
birthright
citizenship
due
to
a
state
department
policy
that
considers
her
born
out
of
wedlock
the
kivitis
said
they
received
official
notice
of
the
rejection
in
early
july
roee
kiviti
told
cnn
in
a
phone
interview
thursday
that
even
though
they
had
been
told
by
the
passport
agency
to
expected
a
rejection
getting
the
letter
in
the
mail
in
writing
so
we
can
see
this
discriminatory
policy
was
really
just
a
punch
in
the
gut
we
knew
that
we
had
to
act
for
our
daughter
for
our
family
for
other
families
so
they
don't
have
to
deal
with
this
he
said
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
us
district
court
of
maryland
by
immigration
equality
lambda
legal
and
pro
bono
counsel
morgan
lewis
asked
for
comment
a
state
department
official
said
they
do
not
comment
on
pending
litigation
we're
confident
that
the
law
is
on
our
side
roee
kiviti
said
our
daughter
is
a
natural-born
american
she
deserves
all
of
the
privileges
and
responsibilities
that
come
of
that
trump
admin
is
denying
citizenship
to
some
children
of
same-sex
couples
both
of
the
kiviti
children
were
born
in
canada
using
an
egg
donor
and
a
gestational
surrogate
when
the
kivitis
applied
for
kessem's
citizenship
her
application
was
processed
not
under
the
policy
for
children
born
abroad
of
two
us
parents
but
rather
flagged
for
surrogacy
under
the
state
department
policy
on
assisted
reproductive
technology
a
child
born
abroad
to
a
surrogate
whose
genetic
parents
are
a
u.s.
citizen
father
and
anonymous
egg
donor
is
considered
for
citizenship
purposes
to
be
a
person
born
out
of
wedlock
because
kessem
was
only
biologically
linked
to
adiel
and
he
was
just
months
short
of
the
residency
requirement
her
application
was
denied
the
kivitis
are
not
the
only
lgbtq
family
to
have
sought
legal
recourse
to
the
policy
according
to
a
release
from
immigration
equality
theirs
is
the
fourth
suit
filed
against
the
state
department
by
the
lgbtq
immigrant
rights
organization
a
federal
judge
ruled
in
favor
of
another
same-sex
couple
who
faced
a
similar
hurdle
under
the
state
department's
surrogacy
policy
in
february
the
state
department
appealed
that
ruling
roee
and
adiel
kiviti
said
that
they've
received
outreach
from
a
number
of
people
saying
they
were
personally
affected
or
know
people
who
were
affected
by
the
policy
even
one
family
is
too
many
adiel
kiviti
said
although
the
kivitis
are
confident
in
their
legal
fight
they
said
that
their
plight
has
been
very
unsettling
we
were
there
when
kessem
was
first
born
when
she
took
her
first
breath
when
she
first
cried
we
were
the
first
people
to
hold
her
we
gave
her
her
first
feeding
her
first
bath
she
first
slept
on
our
chests
we
are
her
only
parents
the
only
parents
she's
ever
known
we
are
her
parents
as
much
as
your
children
are
yours
roee
kiviti
said
and
to
have
that
questioned
is
unsettling
we
know
what
a
family
is
make
no
mistake
there's
no
confusion
on
our
end
we
encourage
the
state
department
to
recognize
that
