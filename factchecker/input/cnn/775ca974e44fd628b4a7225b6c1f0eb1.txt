than
to

that
he
hasn't
decided
whether
to

in

two
other
men
including
the
congressman's
son
are
charged
with

and
other
counts
over
an
alleged
scheme
centered
on
an
australian
pharmaceutical
company
his
co-defendants
also
pleaded
not

thursday
federal
prosecutors
in
the
manhattan
us
attorney's
office
allege
that
the
defendants
acted
on
non-public
information
about
the
results
of
a
drug
trial
which
was
then
used
to
trade
on
the
stock
of
the
pharmaceutical
company
innate
immunotherapeutics
limited
of
which
collins
was
a
board
member
the
indictment
doesn't
allege
that
collins
himself
traded
on
information
about
the
failed
results
of
a
drug
trial
but
that
he
passed
the
information
to
his
son
so
that
his
son
could
execute
trades
the
revised
indictment
known
as
a
superseding
indictment
narrowed
the
charges
against
collins
dropping
some
but
not
all
of
the
securities
fraud
counts
collins
who
was
the
first
sitting
congressman
to
back
president
donald
trump's
bid
for
the
white
house
was
reelected
to
office
several
months
after
he
was
originally
indicted
in
the
insider
trading
case
the
trial
for
collins
and
his
co-defendants
is
set
for
february
but
us
district
court
judge
vernon
broderick
indicated
thursday
that
the
trial
could
be
split
into
two
or
that
the
trial
date
could
be
moved
back
depending
on
whether
collins
attorneys
appeal
certain
aspects
of
the
case
if
they
do
and
those
appeals
are
poised
to
proceed
through
early
the
judge
will
need
to
decide
whether
to
go
to
trial
in
february
with
the
remaining
two
defendants
and
try
collins
separately
at
a
later
date
or
whether
to
try
all
three
defendants
at
a
later
date
likely
during
the
summer
of
collins
whose
primary
election
would
occur
in
june
if
he
decides
to
seek
to
retain
his
seat
said
thursday
that
he
is
highly
confident
that
if
i
run
i'd
win
the
primary
highly
confident
that
if
i
won
the
primary
i'd
be
reelected
in
a
