hopes

will
break
from

rep

netanyahu
has
taken
a
page
out
of
trump's
book
washington
cnn
democratic
minnesota
rep
ilhan
omar
hopes
israel
will
make
a
different
decision
and
break
from
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
as
voters
head
to
the
polls
on
tuesday
in
an
interview
on
cbs's
face
the
nation
on
sunday
omar
said
she
hopes
the
people
of
israel
will
recognize
that
his
existence
his
policies
his
rhetoric
really
is
contradictory
for
many
of
us
in
congress
it
has
been
a
longstanding
support
for
a
two-state
solution
and
this
annexation
now
is
going
to
make
sure
that
that
peace
process
does
not
happen
and
we
will
not
get
to
a
two-state
solution
she
said
i
think
what
is
really
important
is
for
people
to
understand
that
you
have
to
give
people
the
opportunity
to
seek
the
kind
of
justice
they
want
in
a
peaceful
way
and
i
think
the
opportunity
to
boycott
divest
sanction
is
the
kind
of
the
pressure
that
leads
to
that
peaceful
process
netanyahu
announced
last
week
that
he
would
annex
parts
of
the
west
bank
if
he's
reelected
which
if
carried
out
could
deal
a
potentially
fatal
blow
to
efforts
to
negotiate
a
two-state
solution
between
israelis
and
palestinians
omar
a
freshman
congresswoman
and
one
of
the
first
two
muslim
women
elected
to
congress
has
openly
criticized
netanyahu's
government
specifically
its
treatment
of
palestinians
and
questioned
the
longstanding
us
support
for
israel
in
recent
months
democrats
including
the
party's
presidential
contenders
have
demonstrated
an
increasing
willingness
to
break
with
the
pro-israel
foreign
policy
orthodoxy
that
guided
the
party
for
a
generation
omar
and
michigan
rep
rashida
tlaib
have
been
openly
supportive
of
the
bds
movement
formally
known
as
the
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
movement
which
aims
to
end
international
support
for
israel
because
of
its
policies
toward
palestinians
as
well
as
its
continued
construction
of
west
bank
settlements
considered
a
violation
of
international
law
both
omar
and
tlaib
were
banned
from
entering
israel
in
august
and
israel
cited
the
congresswomen's
support
for
a
boycott
against
israel
in
considering
the
ban
israel
announced
it
was
banning
the
congresswoman
came
after
president
donald
trump
an
ally
of
netanyahu
said
israel
would
be
showing
great
weakness
by
allowing
them
to
enter
the
country
in
a
statement
shortly
after
netanyahu
said
the
plan
of
the
two
congresswomen
is
only
to
damage
israel
and
to
foment
against
israel
at
the
time
omar
called
the
decision
an
affront
and
an
insult
to
democratic
values
israel
will
hold
national
elections
on
tuesday
in
which
netanyahu
will
try
for
the
second
time
this
year
to
win
the
elections
and
secure
the
majority
necessary
for
a
governing
coalition
which
he
failed
to
do
in
april
