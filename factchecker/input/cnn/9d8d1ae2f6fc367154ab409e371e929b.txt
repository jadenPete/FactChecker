clash
over
health
care
cnn
elizabeth
warren
is
the
presidential
candidate
with
a
plan
for
just
about
everything
but
there's
one
significant
exception
when
it
comes
to
an
issue
that
is
top
of
mind
for
so
many
voters
health
care
instead
the
massachusetts
democrat
is
running
on
a
bill
that
she
first
signed
on
to
in
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
medicare
for
all
single-payer
legislation
i'm
with
bernie
warren
has
said
more
than
once
in
recent
months
when
asked
about
her
vision
for
the
american
health
care
system
warren's
decision
to
wholly
embrace
another
candidate's
idea
particularly
on
an
issue
of
such
outsized
significance
in
the
election
has
put
her
in
an
unfamiliar
position
of
defending
and
advocating
a
proposal
that
is
not
uniquely
hers
and
she's
made
clear
that
she
has
no
intention
of
authoring
a
comprehensive
health
care
plan
of
her
own
during
the
democratic
primary
contest
warren
has
gone
to
considerable
lengths
in
recent
months
to
demonstrate
unwavering
support
for
medicare
for
all
in
one
of
the
clearest
signs
of
the
political
alliance
forged
between
warren
and
sanders
even
as
they
jockey
for
second
place
behind
former
vice
president
joe
biden
but
there
are
early
signs
of
the
potential
risks
involved
in
warren's
full
embrace
of
sanders
signature
proposal
she's
opened
herself
up
to
the
familiar
criticism
that
medicare
for
all
is
too
expensive
disruptive
and
unrealistic
those
dynamics
were
on
full
display
at
thursday
night's
presidential
debate
when
she
was
asked
again
whether
medicare
for
all
would
result
in
tax
hikes
for
the
middle
class
not
for
the
first
time
warren
pivoted
look
what
families
have
to
deal
with
is
cost
total
cost
warren
said
on
the
debate
stage
without
directly
answering
the
question
about
taxes
and
the
answer
is
on
medicare
for
all
costs
are
going
to
go
up
for
wealthier
individuals
and
costs
are
going
to
go
up
for
giant
corporations
but
for
hardworking
families
across
this
country
costs
are
going
to
go
down
and
that's
how
it
should
work
under
medicare
for
all
in
our
health
care
system
her
argument
is
that
in
the
aggregate
americans
will
spend
less
on
health
care
in
a
single-payer
system
which
would
eliminate
premiums
paid
to
health
insurance
companies
along
with
deductibles
and
copayments
but
questions
about
additional
taxes
for
the
middle
class
are
not
going
away
anytime
soon
and
would
ramp
up
in
intensity
if
warren
were
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
a
warren
aide
declined
to
comment
on
questions
about
whether
there
are
plans
for
warren
to
release
a
health
care
proposal
of
her
own
either
during
the
primary
or
in
the
general
election
campaign
as
well
as
about
middle-class
tax
hikes
under
medicare
for
all
instead
referring
cnn
to
warren's
remarks
after
thursday's
debate
reassurance
for
progressives
if
warren
is
confronting
criticism
from
colleagues
to
the
ideological
right
of
her
the
decision
to
take
an
unequivocal
stance
on
medicare
for
all
has
also
had
the
effect
of
reassuring
some
progressive
admirers
in
interviews
with
cnn
activists
who
vocally
back
medicare
for
all
said
warren's
recent
i'm
with
bernie
positioning
helped
assuage
concerns
about
her
earlier
more
circumspect
tone
on
medicare
for
all
she
has
previously
mused
about
different
pathways
to
medicare
for
all
and
spoken
about
other
less
ambitious
bills
she
had
co-sponsored
in
the
senate
and
asked
by
cnn's
jake
tapper
at
a
town
hall
in
march
whether
she
supported
eliminating
private
health
insurance
as
medicare
for
all
would
effectively
do
warren
responded
that
sanders
has
got
a
runway
for
that
i
think
we
get
everybody
together
and
that's
what
it
is
we'll
decide
she
said
i've
also
co-sponsored
other
bills
including
expanding
medicaid
as
another
approach
that
we
use
waleed
shahid
communications
director
for
justice
democrats
the
group
best
known
for
helping
to
launch
alexandria
ocasio-cortez's
successful
campaign
for
a
congressional
seat
from
new
york
said
warren's
i'm
with
bernie
comments
marked
an
incredibly
important
moment
for
her
campaign
i
think
many
progressives
were
kind
of
confused
and
getting
mixed
signals
from
her
on
medicare
for
all
shahid
said
that
was
a
big
moment
for
her
to
come
out
pretty
full-throated
for
what's
in
the
bernie
and
washington
state
rep
pramila
jayapal
bills
which
is
a
single-payer
system
asked
if
warren
should
roll
out
her
own
version
of
medicare
for
all
shahid
argued
that
such
a
move
might
be
counterproductive
both
for
warren
and
the
single-payer
movement
i
don't
think
she
needs
to
put
out
her
own
plan
or
anything
like
that
he
said
in
fact
putting
out
her
own
plan
would
be
seen
as
competing
with
the
existing
bills
that
people
have
been
rallying
around
and
worked
really
hard
on
one
of
warren's
most
ardent
outside
backers
adam
green
of
the
progressive
change
campaign
committee
acknowledged
on
the
june
night
she
said
it
that
warren's
i'm
with
bernie
declaration
on
the
debate
stage
gave
anyone
who
prioritizes
that
issue
a
permission
structure
for
clearly
voting
for
her
michael
lighty
a
medicare
for
all
advocate
and
former
director
of
public
policy
for
national
nurses
united
the
first
major
union
to
endorse
sanders
in
was
part
of
the
push
to
build
support
in
the
senate
for
the
medicare
for
all
bill
that
included
a
sales
pitch
to
warren's
office
which
he
said
initially
viewed
it
with
some
skepticism
her
staff
gave
the
same
consideration
to
that
policy
that
she
does
to
everything
which
is
pretty
severe
scrutiny
really
said
lighty
who
is
supporting
sanders
again
in
ultimately
though
warren
came
around
to
the
legislation
and
was
in
the
room
next
to
her
colleague
from
vermont
when
it
was
ultimately
unveiled
on
capitol
hill
still
lighty
said
there's
a
nagging
question
in
the
back
of
his
mind
you
have
to
ask
if
bernie's
not
there
what
will
she
do
because
she
says
i'm
with
bernie
and
if
bernie
is
not
there
what
will
she
do
he
said
so
i
think
you
have
to
ask
those
questions
i
don't
think
i
would
consider
her
commitment
and
policy
approach
settled
on
medicare
for
all
another
front
in
the
battle
the
simmering
skepticism
among
some
dedicated
medicare
for
all
activists
is
also
rooted
in
a
less-talked-about
health
care
battle
warren
along
with
fellow
massachusetts
democratic
sen
ed
markey
pushed
as
recently
as
early
for
a
repeal
of
the
affordable
care
act's
tax
on
medical
devices
an
industry
with
a
hub
in
the
bay
state
the
tax
which
republicans
often
targeted
during
obama-era
legislative
standoffs
over
the
health
care
law
was
meant
to
help
offset
some
of
its
new
costs
a
warren
aide
noted
to
cnn
that
her
support
for
repealing
the
tax
has
been
contingent
on
lawmakers
finding
an
appropriate
source
of
alternative
revenue
she
has
since
become
more
vocal
in
her
criticism
of
big
pharmaceutical
and
insurance
companies
railing
against
their
multibillion-dollar
profits
at
a
time
when
millions
of
americans
can't
foot
the
bill
for
life-saving
drugs
or
coverage
and
in
a
video
released
last
week
of
her
recent
conversation
on
health
care
with
ady
barkan
a
year-old
activist
with
als
warren
went
a
step
further
in
assuring
even
the
most
hardline
single-payer
advocates
barkan
noted
that
warren
appeared
to
have
become
increasingly
full-throated
in
her
support
of
medicare
for
all
my
observation
is
that
your
political
philosophical
approach
to
a
system
failure
is
generally
not
to
expand
the
size
of
the
public
sector
but
to
instead
heavily
regulate
private
sector
actors
and
beat
down
their
greed
barkan
said
was
that
the
source
of
your
initial
hesitation
on
the
question
of
getting
rid
of
private
insurance
or
was
it
something
else
warren
gently
pushed
back
saying
her
concerns
had
more
to
do
with
the
transition
than
on
the
end
point
but
she
then
made
a
point
that
for
a
candidate
who
so
often
argues
that
well-regulated
markets
can
conquer
corporate
excess
amounted
to
a
notable
admission
that
health
care
was
different
there
are
areas
where
markets
just
don't
work
and
a
big
part
of
health
care
is
one
of
those
warren
said
so
the
idea
that
we'd
get
a
couple
regulations
in
place
and
it'll
all
it'll
all
sort
itself
out
it's
just
not
true
with
health
care
