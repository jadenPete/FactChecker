winners
and
losers
from
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
cnn
the
top
democratic
candidates
shared
a
single
debate
stage
for
the
first
time
in
the
race
trading
body
blows
while
drawing
stark
contrasts
on
issues
like
health
care
and
criminal
justice
reform
i
picked
the
best
and
the
worst
from
the
night
they're
below
winners
joe
biden
the
first
minutes
of
this
debate
typically
the
time
with
the
highest
viewership
were
biden's
best
moments
in
his
entire
campaign
to
date
he
didn't
stumble
as
he
had
in
previous
debates
and
was
able
to
show
off
his
righteous
anger
side
when
bernie
sanders
seemed
to
suggest
the
former
vice
president
was
responsible
for
people
getting
cancer
worth
noting
as
the
debate
went
on
biden
stumbled
more
biden
also
got
a
bit
lucky
juli
n
castro's
blatant
attempt
to
make
biden's
age
an
issue
he
kept
asking
the
former
vice
president
if
he
was
forgetting
what
had
been
said
a
few
minutes
before
low
blow
and
sort
of
ugly
and
likely
to
boomerang
back
on
castro
more
on
that
below
biden's
full
embrace
of
obama
all
eight
years
good
and
bad
was
also
smart
since
obama
remains
a
hugely
popular
figure
in
the
democratic
party
especially
among
black
voters
overall
biden
looked
strong
and
presidential
although
it
wasn't
perfect
most
notably
in
his
meandering
and
trumpian
answer
on
the
way
forward
on
iraq
and
afghanistan
overall
however
a
good
night
for
the
vice
president
beto
o'rourke
supporters
of
the
former
texas
congressman
have
been
waiting
for
months
for
the
o'rourke
that
showed
up
on
thursday
night
hell
yes
we
are
going
to
take
your
ar-
o'rourke
pledged
when
the
topic
turned
to
gun
control
and
the
recent
mass
shootings
in
texas
and
the
audience
went
wild
yes
o'rourke
was
helped
by
his
opponents
including
biden
and
elizabeth
warren
taking
time
out
to
praise
him
for
his
statements
on
gun
control
and
yes
that
speaks
to
the
fact
that
they
don't
believe
he
poses
any
threat
to
their
chances
at
the
nomination
still
for
a
candidate
who
has
been
losing
altitude
for
months
now
o'rourke
had
a
night
to
remember
barack
obama
after
taking
a
surprising
amount
of
incoming
from
some
of
the
candidates
in
the
july
debate
the
former
president
made
a
major
comeback
thursday
not
only
did
biden
fully
embrace
obama's
eight
years
as
president
the
former
president
was
praised
by
virtually
every
candidate
on
the
stage
which
makes
sense
politically
after
all
obama
is
the
single
most
popular
democratic
politician
in
the
country
by
a
long
shot
kamala
harris
opening
statement
i
thought
a
bunch
of
the
california
senator's
prepared
one-liners
and
she
had
a
lot
of
them
fell
flat
case
in
point
instead
of
saying
no
we
can't
let's
say
yes
we
can
oomph
but
harris
dedicating
her
entire
opening
statement
to
directly
addressing
trump
was
smart
and
her
closing
line
and
now
president
trump
you
can
go
back
to
watching
fox
news
was
a
huge
applause
line
in
the
room
and
likely
will
be
replayed
dozens
of
times
over
the
next
hours
losers
juli
n
castro
the
former
san
antonio
mayor
had
a
clear
plan
going
into
this
debate
go
after
biden
and
paint
himself
as
the
true
heir
to
the
obama
legacy
unfortunately
for
castro
he
went
way
too
hard
at
biden
on
the
age
issue
with
his
are
you
forgetting
line
that
he
repeated
four
times
the
attack
wound
up
making
biden
look
sympathetic
and
the
former
vice
president's
response
measured
and
in
control
made
castro
look
small
andrew
yang
look
i
just
wrote
today
about
how
yang
has
come
from
absolutely
nowhere
to
be
surprisingly
relevant
in
this
race
but
he
stunk
tonight
his
promise
to
give
a
freedom
dividend
a
month
to
families
around
the
country
at
the
start
of
the
debate
came
across
as
gimmicky
rather
than
a
piece
of
provocative
policy
his
line
about
knowing
a
lot
of
doctors
because
he
is
asian
was
painfully
bad
and
furthered
dumb
stereotypes
for
no
reason
elizabeth
warren
the
massachusetts
senator
wasn't
bad
she
just
wasn't
super
involved
in
the
debate
which
is
weird
given
that
she
is
widely
seen
as
the
strongest
challenger
to
biden
at
the
moment
for
a
chunk
of
the
first
hour
of
the
debate
warren
sort
of
disappeared
some
of
that
is
a
function
of
not
getting
questions
from
the
moderators
but
warren
also
needs
to
find
ways
into
conversations
especially
given
how
centrally
located
she
was
on
the
stage
when
she
got
questions
warren
was
solid
particularly
when
talking
about
teachers
and
her
own
personal
narrative
but
she
didn't
get
enough
questions
the
economy
this
was
a
looooong
debate
and
we
know
that
in
election
after
election
voters
say
the
state
of
the
economy
and
how
they
feel
about
it
personally
has
a
huge
impact
on
their
vote
which
makes
the
fact
the
economy
wasn't
the
subject
of
a
single
question
in
that
time
remarkable
and
bad
