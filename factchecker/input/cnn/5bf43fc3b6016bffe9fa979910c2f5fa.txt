await

from

on

washington
cnn
republican
lawmakers
are
bracing
for
the
white
house
to
unveil
the
president
donald
trump's
position
on
guns
divided
over
what
steps
they
hope
the
president
will
take
and
clinging
to
any
word
from
administration
officials
on
where
he
might
be
leaning
attorney
general
william
barr
was
on
the
hill
tuesday
afternoon
to
talk
with
members
about
guns
and
he
has
been
in
contact
with
lawmakers
directly
but
senate
judiciary
chairman
lindsey
graham
said
barr
still
wasn't
clear
where
trump
stood
on
background
checks
they're
still
talking
graham
said
after
having
talked
to
the
attorney
general
on
monday
we're
trying
out
some
new
ideas
on
expanded
background
checks
barr
has
suggested
to
the
president
personally
that
he
consider
expanded
background
checks
noting
law
enforcement
support
for
universal
checks
according
to
a
us
official
briefed
on
the
matter
but
some
of
the
president's
domestic
policy
aides
who
have
the
upper
hand
on
the
issue
have
fought
against
any
such
move
barr
is
expected
to
return
wednesday
for
more
discussions
according
to
a
us
official
briefed
on
the
matter
while
some
republicans
like
graham
have
signaled
a
willingness
to
compromise
on
the
issue
of
expanding
background
checks
at
gun
shows
and
over
the
internet
some
of
the
president's
conservative
allies
in
congress
are
hoping
the
president
keeps
background
checks
off
the
table
we
went
through
this
last
year
and
our
members
remained
firm
in
where
they
were
one
gop
leadership
source
told
cnn
overall
there
isn't
widespread
support
and
i
don't
see
it
changing
enough
for
it
to
happen
behind
the
scenes
administration
officials
are
trying
to
keep
members
of
congress
in
the
loop
with
an
aide
to
sen
pat
toomey
telling
cnn
that
toomey
will
meet
with
senior
administration
officials
tuesday
night
and
a
person
familiar
with
the
negotiations
saying
democratic
sen
joe
manchin
was
also
expecting
to
be
briefed
by
the
white
house
in
upcoming
days
but
until
trump
speaks
everyone
is
waiting
trump
casts
doubt
on
prospect
of
bipartisan
gun
control
proposal
the
holding
pattern
has
created
tension
on
the
hill
with
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
unequivocally
laying
out
he
won't
bring
up
any
legislation
until
he's
clear
where
the
president
stands
i
want
to
know
what
the
president
supports
it's
not
unimportant
to
my
members
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
what
he
thinks
would
make
some
progress
and
he
would
sign
and
until
we
get
that
kind
of
guidance
we're
in
a
holding
pattern
so
to
speak
mcconnell
said
aides
have
expressed
some
surprise
over
just
how
long
it
has
taken
for
the
white
house
to
make
it
clear
where
trump
stands
a
key
gop
lawmaker
said
talks
are
around
what
can
get
done
all
we
know
is
that
they
are
still
batting
around
ideas
talking
to
individual
senators
groups
of
senators
others
majority
whip
john
thune
said
i
don't
sense
that
this
is
coming
to
a
conclusion
just
yet
but
i
think
they
are
grappling
with
a
path
forward
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
art
of
the
doable
is
and
what
are
solutions
that
will
meaningfully
address
the
issue
of
gun
violence
