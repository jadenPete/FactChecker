can
donald
trump
change
the
electoral
map
again
washington
cnn
donald
trump
is
in
new
mexico
tonight
for
a
campaign
rally
the
latest
sign
his
reelection
team
believes
he
can
carry
the
land
of
enchantment
in
which
would
seem
very
unlikely
given
that
a
he
lost
new
mexico
by
points
to
hillary
clinton
in
and
b
democrats
control
the
state's
governorship
both
its
senate
seats
and
its
entire
house
delegation
at
the
same
time
trump
broke
longtime
democratic
strangleholds
on
michigan
pennsylvania
and
wisconsin
in
expanding
the
electoral
map
in
ways
that
looked
candidly
unlikely
even
a
month
or
so
before
that
election
that
recent
history
suggests
that
dismissing
the
trump
campaign's
plan
to
grow
the
map
into
new
mexico
as
well
as
new
hampshire
and
nevada
where
clinton
won
in
is
a
mistake
especially
when
you
consider
that
just
that
sort
of
map
expansion
may
well
be
necessary
if
trump
wants
to
get
reelected
polling
in
pennsylvania
michigan
and
wisconsin
shows
trump's
job
approval
stuck
in
the
low
s
a
very
tough
place
from
which
to
begin
a
campaign
to
re-create
his
winning
coalition
in
those
states
if
trump
does
lose
pennsylvania's
electoral
votes
say
then
he
has
to
make
them
up
somewhere
else
which
is
where
the
trump
campaign
focus
on
growing
the
map
into
new
mexico
comes
in
yes
new
mexico
has
only
electoral
votes
but
every
little
bit
helps
that
trump
narrowed
the
margin
in
new
mexico
from
the
mitt
romney
lost
the
state
by
in
and
the
points
john
mccain
lost
it
by
in
is
likely
spurring
optimism
in
the
president's
campaign
the
belief
in
the
trump
campaign
as
articulated
by
campaign
manager
brad
parscale
is
that
the
president
has
a
winning
message
focused
on
the
economy
for
hispanic
voters
nearly
half
of
new
mexico's
population
is
hispanic
there's
scant
polling
evidence
to
suggest
that
trump
has
an
opening
with
hispanic
voters
in
a
september
cnn-ssrs
poll
two-thirds
of
latino
voters
disapproved
of
the
job
the
president
was
doing
the
point
there's
no
debate
that
trump
almost
certainly
needs
to
expand
the
electoral
map
to
win
a
second
term
it's
far
less
clear
whether
he
can
actually
pull
it
off
again
