beto
o'rourke
just
did
republicans
a
massive
favor
on
guns
cnn
beto
o'rourke's
best
moment
on
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
which
also
doubled
as
his
best
moment
in
the
campaign
to
date
came
when
abc's
david
muir
asked
whether
he
supported
a
mandatory
buyback
of
assault
weapons
hell
yes
we're
going
to
take
your
ar-
your
ak-
o'rourke
said
to
raucous
applause
from
the
crowd
in
houston
texas
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
used
against
our
fellow
americans
anymore
the
former
texas
congressman
defended
that
stance
in
an
interview
on
cnn's
new
day
friday
insisting
the
issue
would
not
hurt
his
party
it's
not
a
concern
of
mine
and
that's
in
part
informed
by
listening
to
people
in
conservative
parts
of
america
he
said
and
folks
are
saying
look
i
would
give
up
that
ar-
or
that
ak-
i
don't
need
it
to
hunt
don't
need
it
to
defend
myself
in
my
home
they
recognize
this
is
a
weapon
designed
for
war
to
kill
people
as
effectively
as
efficiently
and
in
a
great
a
number
as
possible
which
well
count
me
skeptical
that
o'rourke's
idea
will
gain
widespread
political
support
here's
why
for
decades
the
national
rifle
association
and
its
republican
allies
in
congress
and
now
in
the
white
house
have
used
the
idea
of
confiscation
to
win
the
gun
debate
if
democrats
were
in
control
they'd
come
to
your
house
and
take
your
guns
the
argument
goes
it's
why
gun
purchases
soared
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
barack
obama's
election
in
for
example
it
depends
on
if
democrats
want
to
take
your
guns
away
president
donald
trump
said
in
response
to
questions
thursday
about
whether
some
sort
of
gun
control
measure
might
be
passed
by
congress
this
fall
if
this
is
a
movement
by
the
democrats
to
take
your
guns
away
it's
never
going
to
happen
up
until
very
recently
the
democrats-want-to-get-rid-of-the-second-amendment
talk
was
like
so
much
of
trump's
rhetoric
outlandish
and
without
any
basis
in
facts
obama
in
and
and
hillary
clinton
in
expressly
made
clear
they
had
no
interest
in
any
sort
of
mandatory
collection
or
buyback
program
of
course
hillary
does
not
support
national
mandatory
gun
buyback
programs
including
those
modeled
after
australia's
program
said
a
clinton
campaign
spokesman
in
when
the
nra
attacked
her
for
allegedly
supporting
confiscation
she
was
discussing
voluntary
buyback
programs
which
are
drastically
different
than
what
occurred
in
australia
and
are
regularly
run
by
cities
across
the
america
that
changed
or
at
least
shifted
on
thursday
night
with
o'rourke's
comment
while
a
mandatory
buyback
campaign
of
weapons
like
the
ar-
and
ak-
doesn't
amount
to
a
wholesale
gun
confiscation
it
walks
much
closer
to
that
doomsday
scenario
the
nra
has
spent
years
painting
as
just
over
the
horizon
if
democrats
get
into
power
even
if
o'rourke
never
even
sniffs
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
the
eventual
nominee
will
have
to
answer
for
his
support
of
a
mandatory
buyback
program
and
whether
or
not
o'rourke
is
the
nominee
republicans
will
use
his
comments
to
stoke
fear
and
anger
in
their
base
see
we
told
you
democrats
really
want
to
take
all
your
guns
just
look
at
this
quote
from
beto
o'rourke
is
it
possible
that
the
debate
on
guns
and
gun
control
has
been
changed
in
a
fundamental
way
by
the
recent
spate
of
mass
shootings
o'rourke
seems
to
believe
it
has
and
maybe
it
has
but
if
it
hasn't
then
o'rourke
just
handed
republicans
a
massive
political
gift
a
club
to
bash
the
eventual
democratic
nominee
with
on
confiscating
peoples
guns
