joe
biden's
big
night
cnn
to
describe
joe
biden's
performances
in
the
first
two
presidential
debates
as
ok
would
be
to
give
the
former
vice
president
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
a
major
way
biden
was
downright
bad
in
the
first
debate
in
june
and
while
he
was
marginally
better
in
the
second
debate
in
detroit
in
late
july
no
one
would
say
that
the
former
vice
president
looked
and
acted
like
the
frontrunner
that
all
of
the
national
polling
in
the
race
suggests
he
is
the
ex-veep
has
come
across
as
halting
and
unsure
of
himself
a
strange
thing
given
that
he
is
without
question
the
candidate
on
the
stage
with
the
most
experience
in
these
sorts
of
high-profile
and
high-stakes
debates
even
if
biden
hadn't
struggled
somewhat
in
the
first
two
debates
he'd
still
be
the
center
of
attention
tonight
in
houston
when
the
top
candidates
in
the
democratic
field
gather
for
the
third
debate
of
the
race
that
he
has
stumbled
at
times
even
while
his
poll
numbers
have
remained
remarkably
steady
means
that
the
former
vice
president
will
be
under
massive
scrutiny
which
can
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
look
solid
and
in
command
and
avoid
getting
blindsided
by
attacks
from
his
more
liberal
opponents
and
biden
could
take
a
major
step
toward
putting
to
rest
the
is-he-really-up-to-this
whispers
struggle
or
repeat
even
the
performance
he
gave
in
the
second
debate
barely
clearing
what
was
then
a
decidedly
low
bar
and
those
whispers
start
getting
a
lot
louder
the
point
biden
has
been
around
the
political
block
enough
times
to
understand
the
stakes
so
watch
him
and
see
if
he
can
step
up
when
the
lights
shine
the
brightest
