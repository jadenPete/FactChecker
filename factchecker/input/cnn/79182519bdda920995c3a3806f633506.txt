cnn
all
three
republican
primary
challengers
lambasted
state
gop
leaders
and
president
donald
trump
for
opting
to
cancel
their
presidential
primary
elections
in
a
show
of
support
for
the
president
in
the
united
states
citizens
choose
their
leaders

gov
bill
weld
said
in
a
washington
post
op-ed
on
friday
the
primary
nomination
process
is
the
only
opportunity
for
republicans
to
have
a
voice
in
deciding
who
will
represent
our
party
they
added
let
those
voices
be
heard
their
pushback
comes
after
party
leaders
in
kansas
south
carolina
and
nevada
canceled
their
republican
primaries
with
arizona
expected
to
make
it
official
over
the
weekend
the
scrapped
primaries
pose
a
further
obstacle
for
the
long-shot
challengers
already
fighting
the
incumbent
president
who
according
to
a
cnn
ssrs
poll
has
an
approval
rating
among
republicans
it
is
not
unprecedented
for
state
republicans
or
democrats
to
decide
not
to
hold
a
presidential
primary
when
an
incumbent
is
running
essentially
uncontested
in
south
carolina
a
key
early
primary
state
republicans
decided
to
nix
their
presidential
primaries
in
and
when
ronald
reagan
and
george
w.
bush
were
up
for
their
second
terms
while
state
democrats
skipped
their
contests
in
and
with
bill
clinton
and
barack
obama
running
for
reelection
each
of
us
believes
we
can
best
lead
the
party
so
does
the
incumbent
let
us
each
take
our
case
to
the
public
the
three
gop
candidates
wrote
on
friday
the
saying
may
the
best
man
win
is
a
quintessential
value
that
the
republican
party
must
honor
if
we
are
to
command
the
respect
of
the
american
people
cowards
run
from
fights
they
added
in
a
thinly
veiled
jab
at
trump
warriors
stand
and
fight
for
what
they
believe
the
united
states
respects
warriors
only
the
weak
fear
competition
the
trio
pointed
to
the
roiling
democratic
primary
underway
in
arguing
that
ideological
challenges
are
a
focal
point
of
not
only
american
government
but
also
the
republican
party
do
republicans
really
want
to
be
the
party
with
a
nominating
process
that
more
resembles
russia
or
china
than
our
american
tradition
the
group
writes
under
this
president
the
meaning
of
truth
has
been
challenged
as
never
before
do
we
as
republicans
accept
all
this
as
inevitable
are
we
to
leave
it
to
the
democrats
to
make
the
case
for
principles
and
values
that
a
few
years
ago
every
republican
would
have
agreed
formed
the
foundations
of
our
party
the
three
candidates
also
cited
the
risk
of
costly
legal
challenges
to
the
states
predicting
that
they
would
likely
exceed
the
costs
of
hosting
the
primaries
walsh
told
cnn
after
south
carolina's
decision
on
saturday
that
he
would
fight
legally
and
all
other
options
to
challenge
the
states
let
us
spend
the
next
six
months
attempting
to
draw
new
voters
to
our
party
instead
of
demanding
fealty
to
a
preordained
choice
the
three
wrote
if
we
believe
our
party
represents
the
best
hope
for
the
united
states
future
let
us
take
our
message
to
the
public
and
prove
we
are
right
