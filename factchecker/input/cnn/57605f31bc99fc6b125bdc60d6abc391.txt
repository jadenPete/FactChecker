federal
appeals
court
revives
ethics
lawsuit
against
trump
emoluments
and
the
trump
administration
washington
cnn
a
federal
appeals
court
on
friday
revived
an
ethics
lawsuit
against
president
donald
trump
that
argues
his
business
interests
are
conflicts
of
interest
and
violate
the
us
constitution
the
lawsuit
the
plaintiffs
of
which
include
a
hotel
operator
and
a
group
of
restaurants
claimed
trump's
vast
complicated
and
secret
business
arrangements
violate
a
constitutional
provision
the
emoluments
clause
which
bars
the
president
from
accepting
gifts
from
foreign
governments
without
the
permission
of
congress
the
lawsuit
had
been
dismissed
in
late
by
us
district
court
judge
george
daniels
who
said
in
a
decision
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
legal
standing
to
bring
the
suit
the
judge
granted
a
motion
by
the
department
of
justice
to
dismiss
the
case
on
friday
however
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
district
court
did
not
apply
the
law
correctly
in
finding
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case
in
its
opinion
the
appeals
court
said
the
plaintiffs
complaint
alleges
that
plaintiffs
establishments
are
harmed
in
their
competition
with
trump
establishments
because
despite
being
comparable
in
other
relevant
aspects
the
president's
establishments
offer
government
patrons
something
that
plaintiffs
cannot
the
opportunity
by
enriching
the
president
to
obtain
favorable
government
treatment
from
the
president
and
executive
branch
it
alleges
that
the
marketplace
is
thus
skewed
in
favor
of
trump
businesses
because
of
his
unlawful
receipt
of
payments
from
government
patrons
the
appeals
court
opinion
continued
the
complaint
supported
by
expert
declarations
alleges
that
this
unlawful
market
skew
has
caused
plaintiffs
economic
harm
in
the
form
of
lost
patronage
from
government
entities
and
that
such
harm
will
continue
in
the
future
for
competitor
standing
that
is
sufficient
a
spokesman
for
the
department
of
justice
declined
to
comment
friday
a
spokesman
for
the
trump
organization
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
noah
bookbinder
the
executive
director
of
a
nonprofit
group
that
had
been
a
plaintiff
in
the
suit
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
in
washington
said
we
never
wanted
to
be
in
a
position
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
to
court
to
compel
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
follow
the
constitution
however
president
trump
left
us
no
choice
and
we
will
proudly
fight
as
long
as
needed
to
ensure
americans
are
represented
by
an
ethical
government
under
the
rule
of
law
the
group
doesn't
plan
to
rejoin
the
lawsuit
the
lawsuit
turned
on
trump's
decision
not
to
sell
his
business
holdings
before
the
inauguration
instead
of
doing
so
trump
put
his
assets
in
a
trust
which
can
be
dissolved
after
he
leaves
office
and
transferred
control
of
the
trump
organization
to
his
two
eldest
sons
in
july
a
federal
appeals
court
in
a
different
circuit
decided
against
the
plaintiffs
in
a
similar
emoluments
case
in
that
case
it
was
the
attorneys
general
of
maryland
and
district
of
columbia
that
sued
the
president
in
his
official
and
personal
capacity
for
violating
the
anticorruption
clause
the
appeals
court
opinion
in
that
matter
suggested
the
states
competitive
business
interests
could
be
helped
not
hurt
by
trump's
branding
on
his
washington
dc
hotel
if
officials
choose
to
avoid
the
hotel
because
of
its
association
with
him
