will
need
to

in
order
to
avert
a
government

at

significant
obstacles
related
to
president
donald
trump's
border
wall
have
left
negotiators
with
little
choice
but
to
act
on
a
short-term
spending
bill
to
ensure
the
government
stays
funded
past
the
end
of
the
month
house
democrats
have
begun
circulating
a
short-term
continuing
resolution
which
would
fund
the
government
through
november
and
keep
levels
the
same
as
they
were
for
fiscal
year
the
draft
cr
was
sent
to
leaders
in
anticipation
that
republicans
and
democrats
in
the
senate
won't
be
able
find
a
way
forward
on
even
a
small
number
of
spending
bills
by
end
of
the
month
the
early
stumbles
spell
trouble
for
democrats
and
republicans
to
find
an
agreement
at
all
for
the
fiscal
year
spending
bills
the
large-scale
fight
over
the
president's
border
wall
has
permeated
debates
over
even
unrelated
spending
bills
and
could
make
it
impossible
for
democrats
and
republicans
to
come
together
by
the
end
of
the
year
i
think
the
wall
between
republicans
and
democrats
up
here
is
just
the
divisive
issue
said
senate
majority
whip
john
thune
a
south
dakota
republican
arguing
it
had
overshadowed
the
entire
debate
trump
administration
touts
big
drop
in
border
crossings
on
thursday
the
tension
over
the
border
wall
boiled
over
during
a
senate
appropriations
committee
hearing
with
democrats
charging
republicans
that
they
had
underfunded
domestic
priorities
like
the
labor
and
health
and
human
services
appropriations
bill
in
order
to
boost
funding
for
homeland
security
and
the
president's
wall
democrats
also
argued
congress
needed
to
limit
the
president's
transfer
authority
and
his
ability
to
take
money
from
military
construction
projects
and
use
them
to
build
the
wall
no
matter
how
we
feel
about
the
construction
of
the
wall
along
the
southern
border
we
are
appropriators
and
everyone
in
this
room
should
be
outraged
that
the
president
is
contorting
the
law
said
sen
patrick
leahy
a
vermont
democrat
and
the
vice
chairman
of
the
senate
appropriations
committee
behind
the
scenes
republicans
too
have
grown
concerned
about
the
president's
move
to
take
money
from
already-approved
military
construction
projects
but
republicans
have
been
worried
to
cross
the
president
publicly
asked
if
the
membership
wanted
to
block
future
presidents
from
doing
what
trump
did
one
republican
senator
lamented
do
i
have
to
say
if
we
have
any
real
power
in
that
balance
of
power
it
is
the
power
to
decide
how
to
spend
the
money
and
if
the
congress
ever
loses
that
you
don't
have
a
lot
left
to
fight
the
senator
said
the
fight
over
spending
hit
multiple
snags
in
congress
first
week
back
from
recess
with
democrats
threatening
to
introduce
controversial
abortion-related
amendments
to
funding
bills
for
foreign
operations
and
labor
and
health
and
human
services
despite
an
agreement
from
the
summer
where
lawmakers
agreed
not
to
add
so-called
poison
pill
amendments
earlier
in
the
week
the
chairman
of
the
appropriations
committee
republican
sen
dick
shelby
of
alabama
announced
he
was
postponing
subcommittee
hearings
on
the
two
bills
indefinitely
i
hope
the
border
wall
won't
overshadow
the
entire
process
shelby
told
reporters
i
know
there
are
some
impediments
there
hard
feelings
and
strong
views
on
both
sides
of
that
