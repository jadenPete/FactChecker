sean
spicer
just
tried
to
turn
dancing
into
some
sort
of
culture-war
proxy
see
sean
spicer's
debut
on
dancing
with
the
stars
cnn
dancing
with
the
stars
is
as
the
name
suggests
a
dance
show
competition
while
the
winners
and
losers
are
determined
by
a
vote
by
the
public
it
usually
turns
out
that
the
star
who
is
the
best
dancer
or
makes
the
most
progress
in
the
course
of
the
show
wins
america
generally
speaking
gets
it
right
all
of
which
brings
us
to
the
very
curious
case
of
sean
spicer
the
former
white
house
press
secretary
who
made
his
debut
on
dwts
monday
night
spicer
danced
a
salsa
while
wearing
a
very
lime
green
and
very
frilly
shirt
and
a
pair
of
white
pants
the
three-judge
panel
didn't
love
the
performance
giving
him
a
out
of
a
possible
score
what
were
you
doing
there
one
of
the
judges
asked
spicer
according
to
the
daily
beast
it's
like
you
were
being
attacked
by
a
swarm
of
wasps
that's
not
terribly
surprising
after
all
spicer
has
zero
background
in
dance
his
professional
partner
on
dwts
described
him
as
starting
at
a
pre-pre-school
level
and
being
bad
at
dancing
while
on
dwts
isn't
exactly
a
new
thing
master
p
david
hasselhoff
tom
delay
and
steve
wozniak
and
many
more
were
all
laughably
bad
on
the
show
yes
i
was
an
avid
dwts
fan
for
many
years
what
is
surprising
is
that
within
hours
of
his
first
performance
spicer
himself
is
trying
to
cast
his
presence
on
the
show
as
some
sort
of
next
front
in
the
culture
wars
between
coastal
elites
and
the
make
american
great
again
crowd
it
started
monday
night
with
this
tweet
from
former
arkansas
governor
and
longtime
culture
warrior
mike
huckabee
wanna
create
an
emotional
meltdown
in
hollyweird
vote
for
seanspicer
to
win
dancing
with
the
stars
tonight
and
every
night
he's
on
seanspicer
is
a
good
guy
and
a
brave
sport
to
go
on
dwts
let's
show
him
some
love
this
is
the
sort
of
own
the
libs
stuff
that
huckabee
has
trafficked
in
since
trump's
election
the
elites
look
down
on
us
regular
folks
so
let's
show
them
a
thing
or
two
is
a
well-worn
page
in
the
huckabee
handbook
but
then
on
tuesday
morning
spicer
took
it
to
a
whole
new
universe
he
retweeted
huckabee
and
added
this
thank
you
govmikehuckabee
clearly
the
judges
aren't
going
to
be
with
me
let's
send
a
message
to
hollywood
that
those
of
us
who
stand
for
christ
won't
be
discounted
may
god
bless
you
wait
what
so
the
reason
that
the
judges
didn't
like
spicer's
performance
was
because
he
stand
s
for
christ
how
exactly
did
he
draw
that
conclusion
following
that
logic
it's
safe
to
assume
the
judges
are
also
racists
because
former
nba
basketball
player
lamar
odom
who
is
black
got
the
only
score
of
the
night
lower
than
spicer
right
no
what
if
and
stick
with
me
here
because
this
is
going
to
get
very
complicated
spicer
and
odom
just
aren't
good
dancers
what
if
the
reason
spicer
got
a
low
score
had
zero
to
do
with
christ
and
everything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
as
he
himself
has
admitted
he
has
no
formal
training
and
isn't
a
terribly
good
dancer
wild
right
i
told
you
it
was
pretty
out
there
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
spicer's
scores
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
religious
faith
he
is
assuming
all
of
the
judges
on
dwts
and
all
of
hollwyood
i
guess
lacks
any
religious
belief
he
knows
that
what's
spicer
doing
then
taking
a
page
out
of
the
victim
strategy
employed
to
devastating
success
by
donald
trump
in
spicer
is
the
victim
here
not
of
his
poor
dance
moves
but
rather
of
an
anti-religious
conspiracy
that
shuns
believers
the
only
way
to
beat
back
this
march
of
secularism
is
to
vote
for
him
the
logical
twists
and
turns
this
line
of
argument
requires
are
really
something
most
notably
that
if
dwts
was
really
so
biased
against
people
pf
faith
like
spicer
why
would
they
invite
him
to
be
on
the
show
in
the
first
place
don't
think
too
hard
on
it
because
there's
no
there
there
spicer
is
pre-butting
his
possible
removal
from
the
show
as
a
means
to
further
his
own
commercial
interests
if
his
eventual
elimination
from
the
show
means
he
is
just
not
a
very
good
dancer
that's
a
loss
for
spicer
but
if
his
elimination
is
cast
as
the
latest
blow
by
the
elites
against
maga
country
in
an
ongoing
culture
war
well
then
spicer
becomes
a
hero
and
a
symbol
to
a
certain
segment
of
the
public
and
you
can
make
a
lot
more
money
being
a
hero
and
a
symbol
than
being
just
a
bad
dancer
