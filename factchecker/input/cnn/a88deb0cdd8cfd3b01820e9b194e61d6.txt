a
runner-up
in
the
republican
primary
said
he
hopes
to
launch
another
white
house
bid
in
the
future
calling
his
previous
campaign
the
most
fun
i've
ever
had
look
i
hope
to
run
again
the
texas
republican
told
the
christian
science
monitor
on
thursday
we
came
very
very
close
in
and
it's
the
most
fun
i've
ever
had
in
my
life
the
great
thing
is
every
issue
i
was
fighting
for
in
the
presidential
campaign
is
front
and
center
in
the
senate
he
told
the
outlet
cruz's
comments
about
revisiting
a
white
house
bid
come
after
his
narrow
reelection
to
the
senate
in
and
amid
an
evolving
republican
party
that
increasingly
reflects
president
donald
trump's
own
image
as
he
gears
up
for
reelection
in
in
cruz
ended
his
presidential
campaign
which
cleared
a
path
for
trump
to
clinch
the
gop
nomination
after
his
campaign
message
rooted
in
traditional
conservative
values
stumbled
amid
increasingly
unsuccessful
attempts
to
stave
off
trump's
growing
popularity
among
the
strategies
in
his
final
week
were
an
alliance
with
ohio
gov
john
kasich
that
quickly
crumbled
and
naming
carly
fiorina
as
his
running
mate
even
as
he
was
far
from
winning
the
nomination
cruz
was
first
elected
to
the
us
senate
from
texas
in
by
riding
a
wave
of
anti-establishment
sentiment
from
an
evolving
tea
party
movement
he
said
thursday
that
the
state
will
be
key
to
trump's
re-election
texas
is
a
battleground
he
told
the
monitor
on
thursday
texas
is
going
to
be
hotly
contested
in
i
believe
the
president
will
win
texas
i
think
it
will
be
closer
than
last
time
cruz's
comments
to
the
monitor
came
after
a
larger
discussion
with
reporters
at
a
breakfast
event
hosted
by
the
outlet
that
was
largely
rooted
in
the
country's
renewed
debate
on
gun
violence
cruz
a
longtime
opponent
of
stricter
gun
laws
has
garnered
attention
in
this
area
in
recent
days
following
a
meeting
to
discuss
gun
violence
with
progressive
activist
and
actress
alyssa
milano
and
fred
guttenberg
whose
year-old
daughter
jaime
was
one
of
people
killed
in
the
shooting
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
he
tweeted
after
the
meeting
that
he
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
positive
civil
discussion
on
substantive
issues
thank
you
for
coming
having
a
positive
civil
substantive
conversation
he
later
added
i
hope
it
helps
bridge
some
of
the
angry
divides
in
our
nation
and
that
congress
can
come
together
to
stop
violent
gun
crime
while
protecting
the
constitutional
rights
of
law-abiding
citizens
