medicare
for
all
might
raise
taxes
but
still
save

biden
sanders
and
warren
clash
over
health
care
cnn
the
cost
of
sen
bernie
sanders
medicare
for
all
national
health
insurance
plan
prompted
a
heated
argument
between
the
senator
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
who
supports
building
on
the
affordable
care
act
at
thursday's
democratic
presidential
debate
biden
hammered
sanders
saying
america
can't
afford
the
roughly
trillion
price
tag
for
his
plan
that
figure
is
a
year
estimate
and
comes
from
reports
issued
separately
by
two
think
tanks
neither
the
sanders
campaign
nor
the
congressional
budget
office
have
calculated
the
cost
however
that
wouldn't
be
all
new
money
the
federal
government
would
spend
much
more
on
health
care
than
it
does
now
but
much
of
that
would
replace
what
would
have
been
spent
by
individuals
and
employers
as
well
as
states
on
premiums
deductibles
and
co-payments
but
overall
spending
on
health
care
would
be
expected
to
go
up
under
medicare
for
all
since
everyone
would
be
covered
and
experts
say
people
would
likely
go
to
the
doctor
more
currently
health
insurance
isn't
cheap
the
average
family
spent
about
on
premiums
and
on
cost-sharing
in
according
to
the
peterson-kaiser
health
system
tracker
this
is
more
than
five
years
earlier
sanders
has
acknowledged
that
the
middle
class
would
see
their
taxes
go
up
to
help
pay
for
the
plan
one
of
his
options
for
financing
it
would
levy
a
tax
on
employees
exempting
the
first
in
income
for
a
family
of
four
but
he
argues
that
many
would
still
come
out
ahead
because
they
would
no
longer
have
to
pay
for
private
insurance
or
for
medical
care
sanders
has
previously
said
that
an
earlier
iteration
of
his
medicare
for
all
plan
which
called
for
a
tax
on
all
americans
would
have
saved
a
family
of
four
earning
more
than
each
year
