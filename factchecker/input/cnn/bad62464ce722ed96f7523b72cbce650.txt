led
the
charge
for
medicare
for
all
and
has
railed
against
the
current
health
care
system
in
the
united
states
but
a
deeply
personal
moment
on
the
campaign
trail
friday
spoke
to
how
much
the
issue
of
affordable
health
care
affects
americans
fresh
from
the
democratic
debate
the
vermont
senator
began
his
two-day
swing
in
nevada
with
a
town
hall
where
people
opened
up
and
got
intensely
personal
about
their
issues
with
health
care
during
the
friday
event
in
carson
city
a
navy
veteran
named
john
shared
with
sanders
that
he
is
in
debt
because
his
health
insurance
tricare
a
program
for
the
military
is
no
longer
accepted
sanders
listened
intently
as
john
who
said
he
served
years
in
the
military
revealed
that
he
has
been
diagnosed
with
stage
four
huntington's

a
neurodegenerative
disorder
when
asked
by
sanders
how
he
is
going

pay
off
his
debt
john
said
raising
his
voice
i

i
can't
i'm
gonna

the
senator
cut
him
off
hold
it
john

said

john
said
with
frustration
in
his
voice
i
have
huntington's
disease
do
you
know
how
hard
it
is
you
know
you
probably
don't
do
you
i
can't
drive
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
alright
let's
chat
later
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
okay
sanders
said
to
john
as
promised
sanders
and
his
wife
jane
spoke
with
john
after
the
campaign
event
ended
warren
and
sanders
say
americans
don't
like
their
health
insurance
polls
don't
back
that
up
sanders
shared
with
cnn
that
in
this
conversation
with
the
veteran
he
made
sure
his
team
got
the
correct
contact
information
what
i
wanted
to
make
sure
is
that
i
got
the
correct
information
because
what
i
did
not
want
to
happen
is
just
him
talking
about
his
story
but
not
being
able
to
follow
up
with
him
sanders
said
he
told
me
he
doesn't
answer
his
phone
very
much
because
there
are
bill
collectors
calling
him
up
every
day
sanders
said
of
what
he
learned
when
speaking
with
the
veteran
further
sanders
also
shared
that
his
team
has
already
gotten
in
touch
with
one
of
the
nevada
senators
about
this
veteran's
situation
we
have
already
been
in
contact
with
one
of
the
nevada
senators
we're
going
to
get
in
touch
with
the
entire
nevada
congressional
delegation
to
get
him
the
help
that
he
needs
the
vermont
senator
said
we
will
follow
up
on
monday
sanders
later
added
here
is
somebody
who
put
his
life
on
the
line
to
defend
this
country
a
veteran
dealing
with
a
terrible
terrible
illness
and
what
was
obviously
very
unsettling
is
when
he
used
the
word
suicide
sanders
told
cnn
when
reflecting
on
his
interaction
that
was
the
most
dramatic
and
painful
moment
of
the
whole
town
meeting
he
added
this
should
not
be
going
on
in
america
not
for
a
veteran
not
for
any
person
in
this
country
and
it
is
beyond
comprehension
that
under
the
current
healthcare
system
somewhere
like
a
half
a
million
people
go
bankrupt
every
year
because
of
medical
bills
sanders
told
cnn
clearly
we
are
not
doing
what
we
should
be
doing
to
make
sure
that
every
veteran
in
this
country
gets
all
of
the
quality
healthcare
they
need
when
they
need
it
he
said
if
you
or
a
veteran
you
know
needs
help
call
the
veterans
crisis
line
at
talk
and
press
