without
agency
approval
washington
cnn
the
justice
department
has
sued
edward
snowden
who
leaked
american
intelligence
secrets
in
for
allegedly
breaking
decade-old
contracts
he
signed
with
intelligence
agencies
when
he
published
a
book
this
week
snowden
had
signed
secrecy
agreements
with
the
cia
and
national
security
agency
from
to
when
he
worked
as
a
contractor
and
an
employee
of
the
agencies
edward
snowden
says
he
would
like
to
return
to
the
us
if
he
is
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
the
lawsuit
claims
that
under
the
agreements
he
should
have
submitted
for
agency
review
any
of
his
writings
before
publication
if
they
included
intelligence
information
he
needed
written
approval
from
the
agencies
before
he
could
publish
according
to
the
agreements
and
the
lawsuit
the
us
government
says
now
that
it's
owed
royalties
and
payments
from
his
book
which
snowden
released
this
week
according
to
the
lawsuit
by
signing
the
cia
secrecy
agreements
snowden
expressly
acknowledged
that
he
understood
and
accepted
that
the
united
states
government
was
placing
special
confidence
and
trust
in
him
by
granting
him
access
to
classified
information
says
the
lawsuit
filed
tuesday
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
federal
court
his
publisher
has
no
legitimate
claim
to
snowden's
earnings
which
properly
belong
to
the
united
states
the
lawsuit
notes
that
it
is
not
trying
to
restrict
the
distribution
of
snowden's
book
titled
permanent
record
he
and
his
publisher
announced
the
book
on
august
and
its
release
date
was
tuesday
lawsuits
like
the
one
snowden
now
faces
have
become
a
tactic
the
us
government
has
used
since
at
least
the
s
as
recourse
following
leaks
and
books
published
by
former
employees
federal
courts
have
upheld
the
secrecy
agreements
used
by
agencies
more
recently
matt
bissonnette
the
former
navy
seal
team
member
who
wrote
about
his
unit's
raid
that
killed
osama
bin
laden
agreed
to
forfeit
more
than
million
from
his
book
tour
for
the
bestseller
no
easy
day
because
he
failed
to
allow
the
pentagon
a
review
before
the
book's
publication
ben
wizner
director
of
the
aclu's
speech
privacy
and
technology
project
and
an
attorney
for
snowden
blasted
the
government
over
the
lawsuit
saying
snowden
wrote
his
book
in
an
effort
to
spur
conversation
about
surveillance
and
open
societies
this
book
contains
no
government
secrets
that
have
not
been
previously
published
by
respected
news
organizations
wizner
said
in
a
statement
had
mr
snowden
believed
that
the
government
would
review
his
book
in
good
faith
he
would
have
submitted
it
for
review
but
the
government
continues
to
insist
that
facts
that
are
known
and
discussed
throughout
the
world
are
still
somehow
classified
snowden
had
been
a
nsa
contractor
and
cia
employee
before
he
leaked
a
large
cache
of
documents
on
american
intelligence
operations
to
the
media
about
surveillance
programs
that
gathered
information
from
major
tech
companies
as
well
as
a
program
that
tracked
americans
phone
records
he
is
accused
of
espionage
and
theft
of
government
property
by
the
us
government
he
is
living
in
self-imposed

week
that
he
would
like
to
return
to
the
us
on
the
condition
that
he
is
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
i'm
not
asking
for
a
parade
i'm
not
asking
for
a
pardon
i'm
not
asking
for
a
pass
what
i'm
asking
for
is
a
fair
trial
