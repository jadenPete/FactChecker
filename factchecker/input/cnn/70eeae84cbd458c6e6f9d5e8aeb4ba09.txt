someone
must
have
told
the
democrats
that
barack
obama
is
really
popular
cnn
there
were
democratic
presidential
candidates
on
the
debate
stage
in
houston
on
thursday
night
barack
obama
wasn't
one
of
them
although
it's
easy
to
see
why
you
might
be
confused
we
all
owe
a
huge
debt
to
president
obama
who
fundamentally
transformed
health
care
in
america
and
committed
this
country
to
health
care
for
every
human
being
said
massachusetts
sen
elizabeth
warren
i
want
to
give
credit
first
to
barack
obama
for
really
bringing
us
this
far
we
would
not
be
here
if
he
hadn't
the
courage
the
talent
or
the
will
to
see
us
this
far
on
health
care
said
california
sen
kamala
harris
and
of
course
we
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
president
barack
obama
said
former
san
antonio
mayor
juli
n
castro
i
stand
with
barack
obama
all
eight
years
good
bad
and
indifferent
said
former
vice
president
joe
biden
that's
where
i
stand
with
the
exception
of
biden
who
spent
eight
years
at
obama's
side
in
the
white
house
the
homage
to
obama
was
a
change
in
rhetoric
from
past
debates
where
several
of
the
candidates
had
critiqued
the
former
president
for
not
doing
enough
on
health
care
and
immigration
winners
and
losers
from
the
third
democratic
presidential
debate
which
was
always
sort
of
odd
because
well
obama
is
a
hugely
popular
figure
across
all
slices
of
the
democratic
party
polling
conducted
since
obama
left
the
presidency
in
january
regularly
shows
ish
of
the
american
public
view
obama
favorably
and
that
number
is
much
much
higher
among
democrats
and
even
higher
than
that
among
african-american
democrats
who
represent
an
absolutely
crucial
element
of
the
party's
base
consider
this
more
than
in
people
in
a
pew
poll
said
that
obama
was
the
best
or
second-best
president
of
their
lifetimes
in
democrats
and
democratic-leaning
independents
said
obama
was
the
best
or
second
best
in
short
there
is
roughly
zero
good
reason
politically
speaking
for
a
democratic
candidate
running
for
president
in
to
attack
obama
or
even
candidly
lightly
criticize
him
all
of
which
should
play
to
biden's
advantage
because
his
entire
candidacy
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
if
he
was
good
enough
for
barack
obama
he
should
be
good
enough
for
democratic
voters
who
loved
obama
for
example
here's
biden's
answer
on
the
differences
between
his
health
care
approach
and
that
of
warren
and
vermont
sen
bernie
sanders
i
think
we
should
have
a
debate
on
health
care
i
think
i
know
that
the
senator
says
she's
for
bernie
well
i'm
for
barack
i
think
the
obamacare
worked
and
then
there
was
this
exchange
between
castro
and
biden
castro
my
problem
with
vice
president
biden
and
cory
pointed
this
out
last
time
is
every
time
something
good
about
barack
obama
comes
up
he
says
oh
i
was
there
i
was
there
i
was
there
that's
me
too
and
then
every
time
somebody
questions
part
of
the
administration
that
we
were
both
part
of
he
says
well
that
was
the
president
i
mean
he
wants
to
take
credit
for
obama's
work
but
not
have
to
answer
to
any
questions
biden
i
stand
with
barack
obama
all
eight
years
good
bad
and
indifferent
that's
where
i
stand
i
did
not
say
i
did
not
stand
with
him
it's
just
very
hard
to
get
around
that
sort
of
defense
by
biden
obama
is
popular
biden
has
attached
himself
at
the
hip
to
obama
trying
to
pry
space
between
the
two
so
that
you
can
attack
biden
while
looking
like
you
aren't
attacking
obama
is
very
very
hard
which
doesn't
mean
the
other
candidates
including
castro
won't
keep
trying
to
find
a
way
to
do
it
they
will
and
they
might
need
to
in
order
to
pry
black
voters
away
from
biden
but
on
thursday
night
at
least
no
one
cracked
that
code
