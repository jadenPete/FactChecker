judiciary
chairman
nadler's
opening
statement
at
lewandowski
hearing
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
holding
its
first
impeachment
investigation
hearing
on
tuesday
september
here
is
the
opening
statement
of
chairman
jerry
nadler
d-new
york
today's
hearing
is
entitled
presidential
obstruction
of
justice
and
abuse
of
power
this
hearing
is
the
first
one
formally
designated
under
the
committee's
procedures
adopted
last
week
in
connection
with
our
investigation
to
determine
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
with
respect
to
president
trump
we
subpoenaed
three
witnesses
to
this
hearing
rick
dearborn
rob
porter
and
corey
lewandowski
unfortunately
we
learned
last
night
that
the
white
house
is
blocking
the
first
two
from
even
showing
up
and
tightly
limiting
the
third
the
white
house
has
no
authority
legal
or
otherwise
to
give
these
orders
we
had
wanted
these
three
individuals
to
testify
before
the
committee
and
the
american
people
because
they
are
critical
witnesses
to
the
incidents
of
obstruction
laid
out
in
the
mueller
report
in
at
least
five
of
those
episodes
evidence
laid
out
in
the
special
counsel
report
established
that
all
the
elements
of
obstruction
of
justice
were
met
today-
despite
the
roadblocks
the
white
house
has
thrown
up-
we
will
focus
on
one
of
the
most
concerning
of
those
five
episodes
it
is
the
president
ordering
the
attorney
general
through
mr
lewandowski
to
stop
the
special
counsel's
investigation
into
the
president
and
his
campaign
as
the
report
detailed
mr
dearborn
was
enlisted
as
a
part
of
that
effort
as
well
mr
porter
has
other
critical
evidence
regarding
obstruction
as
our
hearings
with
the
special
counsel
and
other
outside
experts
established
anyone
else
involved
in
these
episodes
of
obstruction
would
have
been
charged
with
a
crime
anyone
else
let
that
sink
in
the
president
knows
this
and
the
white
house
is
intent
on
preventing
the
american
people
from
hearing
the
details
so
it's
no
surprise
the
white
house
blocked
two
of
our
witnesses
mr
porter
and
mr
dearborn
from
showing
up
at
all
today
on
behalf
of
the
president
the
white
house
and
department
of
justice
are
advancing
the
same
spurious
legal
doctrine
as
they
did
when
this
committee
called
on
the
most
important
obstruction
witness
to
testify
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
they
claim
porter
and
dearborn
like
mcgahn
are
absolutely
immune
from
testifying
before
congress
there
is
no
such
thing
the
only
court
ever
to
consider
this
purported
absolute
immunity
doctrine
totally
rejected
it
that
is
why
we
have
gone
to
court
in
the
mcgahn
case
to
set
it
aside
what's
happening
today
is
more
troubling
than
mcgahn's
failure
to
appear
because
even
if
we
apply
doj's
own
made-up
rules
of
absolute
immunity
i
question
how
mr
dearborn
fits
under
those
rules
according
to
doj
opinions
absolute
immunity
applies
to
quote
the
president's
immediate
advisers
who
serve
as
the
president's
alter
ego
to
extend
this
already
dubious
doctrine
to
someone
like
dearborn
who
is
far
more
removed
from
the
president
than
mcgahn
is
a
dangerous
new
stretch
i
think
we
should
call
this
what
it
is
an
absolute
cover
up
by
the
white
house
mr
lewandowski
is
here
and
has
vital
information
about
presidential
obstruction
but
the
white
house
wants
to
limit
our
and
your
ability
to
hear
it
all
mr
lewandowski
was
called
alone
one-on-one
into
the
oval
office
on
june
and
again
on
july
and
the
president
did
something
i
find
startling
he
dictated
a
speech
to
mr
lewandowski
a
speech
not
for
mr
lewandowski
but
for
attorney
general
sessions
to
deliver
he
secretly
told
mr
lewandowski
to
put
the
following
words
in
the
ag's
mouth
i
am
going
to
meet
with
the
special
prosecutor
to
explain
this
is
very
unfair
and
let
the
special
prosecutor
move
forward
with
investigating
election
meddling
for
future
elections
so
that
nothing
can
happen
in
future
elections
vol
ii
as
the
mueller
report
found
limiting
the
investigation
to
future
elections
would
have
cut
off
the
investigation
of
any
past
conduct
and
struck
at
the
heart
of
the
special
counsel's
mandate
it
would
have
ended
the
investigation
of
the
president
the
evidence
found
by
the
special
counsel
met
all
the
elements
of
obstruction
mr
lewandowski
was
nervous
about
this
demand
from
his
former
boss
as
he
should
have
been
it
raised
serious
questions
about
criminal
conduct
on
top
of
that
the
ag
was
recused
forbidden
from
doing
anything
regarding
the
mueller
investigation
he
was
certainly
not
allowed
to
curtail
it
so
mr
lewandowski
tried
to
surreptitiously
meet
with
the
ag
when
that
failed
he
tried
to
pass
the
buck
to
mr
dearborn
mr
lewandowski
gave
mr
dearborn
the
script
that
had
been
dictated
by
the
president
all
while
telling
the
president
that
he
would
follow
through
on
the
president's
orders
so
that's
what
we
want
to
try
to
learn
more
about
today
as
we
learned
with
special
counsel
mueller
witness
testimony
is
critical
to
any
investigation
but
the
white
house
doesn't
want
us
or
the
american
people
to
hear
this
story
in
full
late
yesterday
the
white
house
sent
us
a
letter
claiming
that
mr
lewandowski's
conversations
with
the
president
are
protected
from
disclosure
by
executive
branch
confidentiality
interests
they
say
he
may
testify
about
presidential
communications
that
are
already
disclosed
in
the
report
but
no
more
they
make
that
claim
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
a
private
political
operative
apparently
was
not
offering
advice
of
any
kind
the
usual
prerequisite
for
executive
privilege
and
was
enlisted
for
apparent
wrongdoing
no
court
has
ever
said
that
the
president
is
entitled
to
confidentiality
under
these
circumstances
indeed
the
department
of
justice
has
said
executive
privilege
should
not
be
invoked
to
conceal
evidence
of
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
executive
officers
the
white
house
is
advancing
a
new
and
dangerous
theory
the
crony
privilege
it
makes
absolute
immunity
look
good
by
comparison
where
are
the
limits
this
is
a
coverup
plain
and
simple
if
it
were
to
prevail
especially
while
the
judiciary
committee
is
considering
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
it
would
upend
the
separation
of
powers
as
envisioned
by
our
founders
and
today's
coverup
is
a
part
of
a
pattern
of
the
white
house
blocking
congress
the
president
has
announced
his
desire
to
fight
all
the
subpoenas
the
white
house's
obstruction
of
congress
ranges
across
nearly
every
committee
and
virtually
every
investigation
of
the
administration
whether
related
to
children
in
cages
botched
security
clearances
or
their
failure
to
defend
the
country
from
ongoing
attacks
by
a
foreign
adversary
well
mr
lewandowski
you
are
here
under
subpoena
and
that
means
you
are
required
to
answer
our
questions
all
our
questions
completely
and
truthfully
our
investigation
also
extends
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
mueller
report
we
are
looking
at
corruption
and
abuse
of
power
more
broadly
so
we
will
inquire
about
other
subjects
as
well
we
will
not
be
daunted
by
the
coverup
we
intend
to
secure
accountability
for
any
wrongdoing
because
no
one
is
above
the
law
not
even
the
president
of
the
united
states
