sean
spicer
is
just
the
latest
politico
hoping
to
dance
his
way
into
your
heart
see
sean
spicer's
debut
on
dancing
with
the
stars
washington
cnn
tom
delay
in
in
the
middle
of
his
indictment
on
charges
of
campaign
money
laundering
rick
perry
in
after
his
failed
presidential
bid
now
sean
spicer
after
his
brief
and
inglorious
tenure
as
the
white
house
press
secretary
for
the
trump
administration
in
there's
a
long
history
of
figures
pop-cultural
and
political
using
abc's
dancing
with
the
stars
as
a
vehicle
through
which
to
sashay
their
way
to
redemption
week
you
acknowledge
that
this
thing
is
what
you're
known
for
you
say
it
you
come
clean
and
then
it's
over
the
elephant
in
the
room
is
gone
then
you
can
control
the
narrative
deena
katz
co-executive
producer
of
the
show
told
slate's
laura
bennett
in
does
it
work
the
amazing
thing
is
the
transformation
is
often
quite
effective
as
the
atlantic's
megan
garber
wrote
in
the
aftermath
of
us
olympic
swimmer-turned-dancer
ryan
lochte's
own
scandal
aka
lochtegate
during
the
summer
olympics
in
rio
de
janeiro
delay
became
not
just
the
disgraced
politician
but
also
the
guy
who
gamely
made
a
fool
of
himself
on
national
tv
the
punchline
became
just
a
little
more
human
sean
spicer
joins
the
cast
of
dancing
with
the
stars
and
yet
there's
something
far
more
unnerving
about
someone
such
as
spicer
potentially
securing
salvation
in
a
strut
on
dancing
with
the
stars
which
debuted
its
th
season
on
monday
night
clad
in
a
fluorescent
lime
green
frilly
shirt
he
danced
a
salsa
to
the
spice
girls
along
with
coach
lindsay
arnold
earning
a
score
of
out
of
more
specifically
unlike
with
most
other
past
offenders
who've
gone
to
the
altar
of
dwts
spicer's
transgressions
are
potentially
beyond
game-show
atonement
recall
spicer's
lies
as
a
taxpayer-funded
public
servant
that
the
audience
at
president
donald
trump's
inauguration
was
the
largest
audience
ever
to
witness
an
inauguration
period
both
in
person
and
around
the
globe
and
that
donald
trump
jr
s
meeting
with
a
russian
lawyer
was
only
about
adoption
and
the
magnitsky
act
maybe
even
worse
he
shielded
trump's
debunked
claims
that
millions
of
people
voted
illegally
in
the
presidential
election
he
also
tried
to
cover
for
trump's
lie
that
former
president
barack
obama
wiretapped
trump
tower
put
another
way
spicer's
white
house
performance
included
more
than
just
little
white
lies
what
would
it
say
about
us
as
a
society
to
forgive
someone
who
for
months
distorted
and
deceived
from
the
white
house
lectern
merely
because
he's
willing
to
look
silly
in
front
of
a
live
audience
in
some
ways
spicer's
arc
from
a
government
official
to
a
dwts
contestant
isn't
surprising
after
all
it's
just
the
reverse
of
trump's
pivot
from
reality
television
to
the
presidency
still
spicer's
trajectory
is
consistent
with
amanda
hess
investigation
into
the
consequences
of
democracy
reimagined
into
celebrity
fandom
the
point
of
translating
politics
into
pop
culture
may
be
to
make
it
more
accessible
but
it
can
also
make
politics
feel
oddly
remote
as
if
it
is
all
just
a
television
show
to
watch
or
a
fantasy
novel
to
read
or
a
game
to
play
she
wrote
for
the
new
york
times
indeed
while
spicer's
enthusiasm
to
appear
on
dwts
might
be
endearing
to
some
at
the
end
of
the
day
it's
worth
asking
who's
playing
and
who's
getting
played
