cnn
the
white
house
is
asserting
that
two
former
senior
white
house
aides
have
immunity
from
testifying
and
is
directing
former
trump
campaign
manager
corey
lewandowski
not
to
answer
questions
about
events
that
occurred
after
president
donald
trump
was
elected
the
white
house
sent
letters
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
monday
about
the
testimony
of
lewandowski
and
former
aides
rick
dearborn
and
rob
porter
who
were
all
subpoenaed
to
appear
on
tuesday
the
white
house
asserted
immunity
for
the
former
white
house
aides
not
to
testify
and
instructed
lewandowski
not
to
answer
questions
about
his
conversations
with
the
president
where
the
white
house
could
invoke
executive
privilege
beyond
what's
already
in
former
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
report
mr
lewandowski's
conversations
with
the
president
and
with
senior
advisers
to
the
president
are
protected
from
disclosure
by
long-settled
principles
protecting
executive
branch
confidentiality
interests
wrote
white
house
counsel
pat
cipollone
and
as
a
result
the
white
house
has
directed
mr
lewandowski
not
to
provide
information
about
such
communications
beyond
the
information
provided
in
the
portions
of
the
report
that
have
already
been
disclosed
to
the
committee
the
house
judiciary
committee
last
month
subpoenaed
lewandowski
dearborn
and
porter
but
the
two
white
house
aides
are
not
expected
to
appear
sources
said
citing
the
white
house
arguments
while
lewandowski
is
unlikely
to
engage
on
the
episodes
detailed
in
the
special
counsel's
obstruction
of
justice
report
where
he
was
involved
democrats
on
the
judiciary
committee
have
rejected
the
trump
administration's
legal
arguments
of
immunity
and
the
right
to
claim
executive
privilege
in
a
statement
monday
night
house
judiciary
committe
chairman
jerry
nadler
said
the
decision
to
keep
the
aides
from
testifying
was
a
shocking
and
dangerous
use
of
executive
privilege
the
president
would
have
us
believe
that
he
can
willfully
engage
in
criminal
activity
and
prevent
witnesses
from
testifying
before
congress
even
if
they
did
not
actually
work
for
him
or
his
administration
the
new
york
democrat
said
if
he
were
to
prevail
in
this
cover-up
while
the
judiciary
committee
is
considering
whether
to
recommend
articles
of
impeachment
he
would
upend
the
separation
of
powers
as
envisioned
by
our
founders
the
white
house's
position
on
the
testimony
of
lewandowski
porter
and
dearborn
adds
to
the
growing
fight
between
the
trump
administration
and
the
judiciary
committee
over
the
panel's
investigation
and
its
efforts
to
obtain
testimony
from
those
cited
by
mueller
the
white
house
has
also
asserted
immunity
over
the
testimony
of
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
and
the
committee
has
sued
in
order
to
compel
his
appearance
which
is
still
being
litigated
the
department
of
justice
has
advised
me
that
mr
dearborn
and
mr
porter
are
absolutely
immune
from
compelled
congressional
testimony
with
respect
to
matters
related
to
their
services
as
senior
adviser
to
the
president
cipollone
wrote
in
a
separate
letter
porter's
attorney
brant
bishop
told
the
committee
on
monday
that
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
were
at
odds
over
the
issue
and
porter
would
respect
his
former
employer's
wishes
the
committee's
dispute
is
with
the
white
house
not
with
mr
porter
bishop
wrote
the
outcome
of
the
mcgahn
case
will
likely
determine
whether
dearborn
and
porter
ultimately
testify
before
the
committee
too
other
witnesses
have
appeared
before
congressional
committees
but
declined
to
answer
questions
about
the
trump
white
house
or
the
presidential
transition
hope
hicks
for
instance
would
not
discuss
anything
about
her
time
in
the
white
house
including
where
her
office
was
located
though
she
did
answer
questions
about
her
time
on
the
campaign
as
trump's
first
campaign
manager
lewandowski
won't
have
privilege
to
decline
to
answer
questions
about
the
campaign
but
the
committee
is
most
interested
in
questioning
him
about
mueller's
detailing
of
alleged
episodes
that
occurred
in
the
white
house
which
he
is
unlikely
answer
including
when
the
president
allegedly
instructed
him
to
tell
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
curtail
the
mueller
investigation
and
lewandowski
did
not
follow
through
the
white
house
is
not
asserting
executive
privilege
but
claiming
the
right
to
do
so
in
the
future
lewandowski
testified
before
the
house
intelligence
committee
last
year
behind
closed
doors
in
a
contentious
profanity-laced
session
and
he
did
not
answer
questions
about
anything
that
occurred
beyond
the
election
the
white
house
has
made
similar
claims
about
the
right
to
assert
executive
privilege
for
someone
who
didn't
work
in
the
white
house
including
when
former
kansas
secretary
of
state
kris
kobach
testified
before
the
house
oversight
committee
when
the
white
house
said
kobach's
conversations
with
the
president
about
adding
a
citizenship
question
to
the
census
were
confidential
