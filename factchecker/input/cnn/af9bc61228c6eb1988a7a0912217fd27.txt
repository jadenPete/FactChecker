the

which

off

on

according

chairman
robert

the
last
missing
victim
from
the
california
dive
boat
fire
has
been
located
a
crewmember
sleeping
in
the
wheelhouse
berths
was
awakened
by
a
noise
and
got
up
to
investigate
the
report
says
he
saw
a
fire
at
the
aft
end
of
the
sun
deck
rising
up
from
the
salon
compartment

crewmember

crewmembers
awoke
the
captain
radioed
a
distress
message
to
the
coast
guard
sumwalt
told
cnn
in
an
interview
that
the
incident
is
a
horrible
horrible
tragedy
calling
it
the
deadliest
marine
accident
in
nearly
years
and
the
the
most
deadly
transportation
accident
that
we've
seen
in
a
decade
part
of
the
certificate
for
this
vessel
required
that
there
be
constantly
a
roving
watch
person
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
safety
of
the
vessel
sumwalt
said
the
interviews
to
this
point
have
indicated
that
the
five
surviving
crew
members
were
in
fact
asleep
at
the
time
that
the
fire
broke
out
he
said
investigators
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
an
additional
crew
member
and
any
of
the
passengers
who
were
all
below
deck
and
died
were
awake
an
attorney
for
truth
aquatics
owner
of
the
conception
said
in
a
statement
that
a
crewmember
checked
the
area
where
the
fire
is
believed
to
have
been
concentrated
soon
before
it
ignited
but
the
attorney
did
not
point
to
any
evidence
the
crewmember
remained
awake
we
do
have
witness
testimony
that
seems
to
contradict
the
notion
that
the
entire
crew
was
asleep
attorney
douglas
schwartz
said
in
the
statement
we
do
know
that
one
crewmember
checked
on
and
around
the
galley
area
at
around
a
m
approximately
minutes
before
the
fire
broke
out
the
statement
added
that
the
company
believes
the
fire
was
not
caused
by
the
operator
the
boat
or
the
crew
who
acted
heroically
and
did
all
in
their
power
to
try
and
save
the
lives
of
the
passengers
and
their
fellow
crew
member
the
report
describes
how
the
surviving
crewmembers
say
they
attempted
to
reach
the
entryways
to
the
passenger
compartment
although
their
path
was
blocked
by
fire
one
crewmember
broke
his
leg
in
the
process
and
three
crewmembers
including
the
captain
swam
to
the
stern
to
check
the
engine
room
for
flames
but
found
none
the
report
came
as
experts
are
giving
alarming
safety
assessments
of
small
passenger
and
recreational
vessels
like
conception
the
preliminary
report
did
not
identify
what
may
have
caused
the
fire
and
it
made
no
recommendations
for
safety
improvements
the
ntsb
typically
waits
until
its
investigation
is
completed
to
make
recommendations
sumwalt
said
investigators
work
is
continuing
but
that
they
have
not
identified
anything
that
warrants
immediate
corrective
action
small
passenger
and
recreational
vessels
the
fleet
of
commercial
diving
and
pleasure
craft
are
aging
due
to
a
s
law
that
requires
commercial
vessels
be
built
in
the
us
one
marine
firefighting
expert
tom
guldner
a
retired
new
york
firefighter
and
now
president
of
marine
firefighting
inc
called
this
type
of
boat
a
floating
bomb
because
they
carry
hundreds
of
gallons
of
fuel
but
are
subject
to
what
this
expert
saw
as
lax
safety
regulations
meanwhile
safety
and
fire
experts
are
warning
that
marine
regulations
put
passengers
at
risk
rod
jones
a
captain
in
california
with
years
of
experience
said
many
charter
companies
cannot
afford
the
cost
of
building
a
new
boat
in
the
us
and
as
a
result
vessels
are
operated
for
as
long
as
possible
you
can't
take
enough
divers
out
there
to
make
enough
money
to
pay
for
building
these
boats
jones
said
the
system
is
just
so
broken
that
it's
made
the
public
very
very
unsafe
he
said
we
talk
about
this
in
the
industry
all
the
time
experts
also
voice
concerns
that
the
standards
that
once
fit
have
not
kept
up
with
the
time
including
the
size
of
exit
hatches
and
that
older
craft
can
be
grandfathered
in
unsafe
ways
the
coast
guard
said
because
the
conception
accident
is
still
under
investigation
it
cannot
comment
on
potential
changes
to
regulations
it
is
too
early
in
the
conception
investigation
to
determine
if
there
will
be
any
regulatory
changes
related
to
the
passenger
vessel
industry
lt
amy
midgett
told
cnn
in
a
statement
the
national
transportation
safety
board
and
the
coast
guard
will
conduct
thorough
and
detailed
investigations
to
determine
potential
casual
factors
associated
with
this
tragedy
experts
say
the
primary
fire
risks
onboard
include
the
fuel
the
engine
the
electrical
components
and
any
kitchen
appliances
if
the
ship
includes
a
galley
the
potential
fire
risks
on
a
vessel
are
very
similar
to
the
risks
in
a
residence
said
lawrence
russell
of
the
national
fire
protection
association
however
the
similarities
end
there
it's
not
as
easy
to
run
out
into
the
front
yard
said
guldner
the
retired
new
york
firefighter
and
now
president
of
marine
firefighting
inc
the
options
are
to
either
put
the
fire
out
or
you're
going
to
be
swimming
