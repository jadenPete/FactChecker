president
donald
trump
in
a
statement
on
saturday
said
late
al
qaeda
leader
osama
bin
laden's
son
hamza
bin
laden
had
been
killed
in
a
united
states
counterterrorism
operation
in
the
afghanistan
pakistan
region
he
did
not
give
a
time
period
for
the
operation
or
the
death
the
loss
of
hamza
bin
ladin
not
only
deprives
al-qa'ida
of
important
leadership
skills
and
the
symbolic
connection
to
his
father
but
undermines
important
operational
activities
of
the
group
the
president
said
in
the
statement
trump
also
said
hamza
bin
ladin
was
responsible
for
planning
and
dealing
with
various
terrorist
groups
cnn
previously
reported
on
july
that
the
us
believed
hamza
bin
laden
was
dead
at
that
time
two
defense
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
operation
told
cnn
that
bin
laden
had
been
killed
at
least
several
months
prior
osama
bin
laden's
son
is
taking
over
as
al
qaeda
leader
us
says
cnn
terrorism
analyst
paul
cruickshank
told
cnn
at
the
time
that
one
thing
puzzled
researchers
who
are
closely
tracking
al
qaeda
if
hamza
bin
laden
has
indeed
been
dead
for
months
you
would
expect
al
qaeda
to
have
released
some
form
of
eulogy
before
today
the
fact
they
haven't
is
highly
unusual
given
his
status
in
the
group
us
secretary
of
defense
mark
esper
also
appeared
to
confirm
in
a
fox
news
interview
in
august
that
hamza
bin
laden
was
dead
us
officials
told
cnn
saturday
that
the
administration
wanted
to
make
sure
it
explored
all
angles
and
gathered
all
of
the
intelligence
it
could
before
making
the
announcement
earlier
this
year
the
us
state
department
called
bin
laden
who
was
believed
to
be
in
his
early
s
an
emerging
leader
in
the
terror
group
offering
a
million-dollar
reward
for
information
leading
to
his
capture
as
far
as
rewards
go
however
it
was
a
distinctly
modest
one
the
price
on
the
head
of
ayman
az-zawahiri
the
actual
leader
of
al
qaeda
is
million
the
state
department
said
items
seized
from
the
elder
bin
laden's
hiding
place
in
pakistan
during
the
us
navy
seal
raid
in
that
resulted
in
his
death
indicated
he
was
grooming
hamza
bin
laden
to
replace
him
as
al
qaeda's
leader
saudi
arabia
revoked
hamza
bin
laden's
citizenship
official
newspaper
um
al-qura
reported
earlier
this
year
citing
a
royal
order
issued
to
the
interior
ministry
al
qaeda
is
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
a
ragged
collection
of
dispersed
groups
with
little
in
the
way
of
coordination
it
was
long
ago
eclipsed
by
isis
which
at
its
height
controlled
an
area
the
size
of
britain
ruling
over
nearly
million
people
