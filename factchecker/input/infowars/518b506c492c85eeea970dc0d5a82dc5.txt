google
is
watching
you
in
your
home
always-on
camera
uses
facial
recognition
to
track
people
inside
their
own
homes
google's
new
always-on
camera
can
now
recognize
your
face
inside
your
home
the
new
device
the
nest
hub
max
includes
a
wide-angle
camera
that
can
track
different
people's
faces
and
thus
tailor
content
to
each
individual
person
which
of
course
leads
to
privacy
concerns
not
to
mention
comparisons
to
george
orwell
for
one
thing
the
camera
has
to
stay
on
so
it
can
zero
in
on
people
as
they
walk
into
its
view
according
to
an
op
ed
from
the
washington
post
if
you
opt
in
to
the
hub
max's
face
match
features
google
asks
each
family
member
to
briefly
scan
his
or
her
mug
then
the
hub
max's
camera
stays
on
ambiently
looking
for
those
faces
when
the
assistant
finds
one
it
tailors
the
content
on
its
screen
in
the
morning
it
spotted
me
and
proactively
displayed
a
rundown
of
my
day
and
commute
i
never
issued
a
command
you
can
also
use
it
to
leave
reminders
that
pop
up
when
the
intended
recipient
passes
by
let's
compare
that
to
the
following
passage
from
the
novel
the
telescreen
received
and
transmitted
simultaneously
any
sound
that
winston
made
above
the
level
of
a
very
low
whisper
would
be
picked
up
by
it
moreover
so
long
as
he
remained
within
the
field
of
vision
which
the
metal
plaque
commanded
he
could
be
seen
as
well
as
heard
there
was
of
course
no
way
of
knowing
whether
you
were
being
watched
at
any
given
moment
how
often
or
on
what
system
the
thought
police
plugged
in
on
any
individual
wire
was
guesswork
it
was
even
conceivable
that
they
watched
everybody
all
the
time
but
at
any
rate
they
could
plug
in
your
wire
whenever
they
wanted
to
you
had
to
live
did
live
from
habit
that
became
instinct
in
the
assumption
that
every
sound
you
made
was
overheard
and
except
in
darkness
every
movement
scrutinized
and
while
the
washington
post
pointed
out
the
supposed
steps
google
is
taking
to
protect
privacy
the
article's
author
still
said
the
concerns
only
multiply
from
here
today
the
face
features
are
only
accessible
by
google
but
what
happens
when
it
begins
letting
other
apps
and
services
access
your
face
or
when
the
tech
also
detects
emotion
in
a
face
ultimately
the
hub
max
suffers
from
the
same
affliction
as
many
new
google
products
it's
frighteningly
advanced
technology
that
hasn't
identified
the
problem
in
our
lives
that
needs
solving
none
of
the
camera
functions
the
hub
max
offers
today
make
it
worth
bringing
surveillance
inside
my
house
also
keep
in
mind
the
proposal
brought
to
the
trump
administration
that
would
allow
big
tech
to
monitor
private
conversations
and
user
behavior
that
could
then
be
used
by
the
government
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
can
own
a
gun
watch
fire
power
