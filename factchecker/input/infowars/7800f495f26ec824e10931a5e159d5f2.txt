read
the
white
house's
expos
of
the
washington
post
from
memorial
day
to
labor
day
the
post
had
some
pretty
embarrassing
moments
it's
been
a
lost
summer
for
the
washington
post
from
memorial
day
to
labor
day
the
post
had
some
pretty
embarrassing
moments
whether
it
was
incorrectly
stating
that
presidents
do
not
deliver
remarks
on
the
th
of
july
ignoring
speeches
by
presidents
reagan
kennedy
and
obama
or
being
called
out
for
shoddy
politically
motivated
fact-checking
the
post's
lost
summer
culminated
with
a
fateful
day
in
august
when
they
were
forced
to
issue
corrections
to
a
single
article
but
as
the
summer
came
to
a
close
the
post
set
out
to
report
the
president's
summer
accomplishments
but
reporting
is
not
what
the
post
does
two
of
its
writers
published
an
opinion
article
they
claimed
was
news
but
that
instead
pushed
their
own
personal
political
narrative
that
president
trump
had
a
lost
summer
of
squandered
opportunities
and
few
accomplishments
the
truth
is
trump
racked
up
many
well-documented
victories
that
directly
benefited
the
american
people
at
home
and
abroad
when
the
post
asked
the
white
house
proudly
provided
it
with
a
detailed
list
of
the
administration's
most
important
successes
of
the
summer
of
those
accomplishments
the
post
chose
to
publish
just
four
which
it
buried
under
paragraphs
of
editorialized
critique
media
bias
comes
in
two
forms
it
plays
a
role
in
deciding
what
news
is
and
is
not
covered
and
also
in
deciding
how
that
news
is
covered
in
this
instance
the
post
s
reporters
are
guilty
of
both
it
is
obvious
they
had
their
own
predetermined
pre-written
narrative
and
they
simply
discarded
information
that
could
have
challenged
that
this
is
not
only
a
disservice
to
readers
but
it's
also
an
offensive
egregious
affront
to
true
news
journalism
the
post
could
have
written
about
the
president's
directive
to
ease
all
federal
student
loan
debt
for
disabled
veterans
they
didn't
they
could
have
written
about
the
first
time
in
history
a
sitting
united
states
president
walked
across
the
dmz
into
north
korea
not
a
chance
they
could
have
written
about
the
first
stage
of
the
president's
historic
trade
deal
with
japan
which
will
give
our
american
farmers
even
more
access
to
one
of
the
largest
and
most
promising
markets
of
course
not
the
president
even
fixed
dangerous
immigration
loopholes
to
increase
border
security
and
make
american
communities
safer
but
these
two
reporters
would
not
deviate
from
their
preset
narrative
and
write
about
that
either
to
be
clear
in
a
news
article
about
trump's
summer
accomplishments
the
post
not
only
chose
to
ignore
but
refused
to
cite
of
the
president's
actual
summer
accomplishments
respectable
reputable
responsible
news
reporters
would
have
listed
those
gathered
opinions
from
sources
with
diverse
perspectives
and
presented
all
of
this
information
to
their
readers
so
they
could
develop
their
own
opinions
doing
so
would
be
a
valuable
nonpartisan
service
to
all
americans
from
across
the
political
spectrum
sadly
the
washington
post
wasn't
alone
this
summer
it
is
impossible
to
trust
the
media
when
the
executive
director
of
the
new
york
times
is
caught
on
tape
outlining
plans
to
transition
its
coverage
from
the
russian
hoax
to
another
false
narrative
about
trump
and
racism
or
when
tv
networks
accused
the
president
of
manufacturing
a
crisis
at
our
southern
border
only
to
later
flip-flop
and
blame
him
for
congress
refusal
to
fix
that
very
crisis
many
in
the
media
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
to
rip
trump
for
calling
baltimore
rat
infested
but
the
media
never
apologized
when
a
video
surfaced
of
baltimore
mayor
catherine
pugh
making
the
exact
same
complaint
when
the
president
called
out
the
anti-semitic
comments
media
posts
and
associations
by
reps
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
ayanna
pressley
ilhan
omar
and
rashida
tlaib
the
press
dismissed
the
democrats
bigotry
as
a
mere
invitation
to
dialogue
about
jewish
influence
in
the
world
there
was
also
a
summer's
worth
of
major
outlets
openly
questioning
trump's
sanity
but
the
hourly
gaffes
by
joe
biden
are
part
of
what
humanizes
him
no
wonder
the
national
media's
popularity
sits
somewhere
between
smallpox
and
the
plague
as
congress
prepares
to
return
from
its
six-week-long
recess
americans
deserve
to
know
that
trump
has
been
hard
at
work
this
summer
and
every
day
since
he
took
office
keeping
his
promises
to
the
american
people
after
decades
of
neglect
by
washington
our
economy
immigration
system
trade
deals
employment
numbers
and
prospects
of
peacefully
ending
years
of
war
abroad
are
better
than
they
have
ever
been
despite
record-setting
accomplishments
in
record-setting
time
data
shows
the
news
coverage
of
trump
has
been
negative
the
most
egregious
and
dangerous
forms
of
this
bias
thrived
this
summer
at
media
outlets
like
the
washington
post
which
routinely
masquerade
opinion
as
news
heading
into
the
fall
the
post
and
others
should
at
the
very
least
pledge
to
sequester
such
breathless
partisanship
rampant
editorializing
and
obvious
bias
to
their
opinion
pages
