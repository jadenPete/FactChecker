as
snap
election
looms
nigel
farage
throws
boris
johnson
a
lifeline
with
a
catch
farage
has
repeatedly
said
he
would
tell
his
people
to
stand
down
if
prime
minister
boris
johnson
was
willing
to
strike
a
deal
while
polling
suggests
a
general
election
without
brexit
having
been
delivered
would
be
a
fatal
blow
to
the
conservatives
the
brexit
party's
nigel
farage
has
said
he
would
give
boris
johnson
a
clean
run
at
victory
on
the
condition
he
scrapped
theresa
may's
hated
brexit
deal
the
prime
minister
has
repeatedly
said
he
would
take
the
country
out
of
the
european
union
on
october
st
do
or
die
meaning
with
or
without
a
negotiated
deal
with
the
european
union
but
has
made
abundantly
clear
his
preferred
route
is
to
agree
on
a
deal
with
brussels
this
is
unacceptable
to
many
brexiteers
who
point
out
the
flaws
of
the
deal
that
were
present
when
mr
johnson
himself
voted
against
it
twice
in
early
remain
in
place
and
that
to
sign
the
nation
up
to
a
new
european
treaty
resembles
a
betrayal
of
the
spirit
of
the
brexit
vote
nigel
farage
if
boris
johnson
is
brave
enough
a
brexit-tory
alliance
would
be
unstoppable

perhaps
the
greatest
electoral
threat
to
boris
johnson
now
is
not
the
official
opposition
labour
party
which
has
drifted
to
a
position
of
explicitly
opposing
the
result
of
the
referendum
where
the
british
people
voted
to
leave
the
european
union
but
is
nigel
farage's
brexit
party
the
new
political
force
which
earlier
this
year
went
from
a
standing
start
to
winning
the
european
parliament
elections
is
now
in
a
position
to
stand
a
candidate
in
every
constituency
in
the
country
the
number
of
conservative
mps
elected
in
a
snap
election
could
be
greatly
reduced
if
all
of
those
brexit
candidates
stand
