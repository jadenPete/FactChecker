firing
of
john
bolton
nightmare
for
netanyahu
as
trump
says
he'll
talk
to
iran
with
no
preconditions
if
trump
could
actually
go
through
with
much
of
the
pro-peace
anti-war
agenda
he
ran
on
it
would
be
a
major
victory
it
looks
as
though
president
trump
may
be
trying
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
neocon
cabal
that
surrounds
him
on
tuesday
trump
announced
on
twitter
he
was
firing
john
bolton
bolton
claimed
he
planned
to
resign
neocons
and
neolibs
both
threw
fits
over
it
president
trump
has
taken
action
by
firing
john
bolton
and
has
vowed
to
take
on
big
tech
censorship
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
gave
a
speech
today
which
he
unexpectedly
delayed
by
an
hour
where
he
announced
that
he
plans
to
annex
a
third
of
the
west
bank
after
the
israeli
election
he
was
hoping
trump
would
sign
off
on
the
annexation
but
that
never
came
a
trump
administration
official
instead
said
tuesday
after
netanyahu's
speech
that
there
is
no
change
in
the
united
states
policy
at
this
time
instead
pompeo
announced
that
trump
wants
to
meet
iranian
president
rouhani
with
no
preconditions
tablet
magazine's
yair
rosenberg
described
the
news
as
a
nightmare
for
netanyahu
just
days
before
israel's
elections
incidentally
netanyahu
was
also
whisked
offstage
tuesday
night
as
air
sirens
were
blaring
after
two
rockets
were
fired
from
the
gaza
strip
the
final
straw
for
trump
to
fire
bolton
was
reportedly
bolton
sabotaging
peace
talks
with
the
taliban
trump
was
reportedly
also
angry
bolton
sabotaged
peace
talks
with
north
korea
from
the
new
york
times
i'm
not
going
to
get
my
hopes
up
that
trump
is
turning
a
page
until
we
actually
see
some
concrete
results
as
the
parasites
around
him
always
seem
to
find
a
way
to
thwart
his
better
instincts
but
these
are
certainly
encouraging
developments
if
trump
could
actually
go
through
with
much
of
the
pro-peace
anti-war
agenda
he
ran
on
it
would
be
a
major
victory
