he'd
reassure
people
afraid
the

take
their
assault
weapons
away

if
we
don't
call
it
out
for
what
it
is
if
we're
not
able
to
speak
clearly
act
decisively
then
we
will
continue
to
have
this
kind
of
bloodshed
in
america
and
i
cannot
accept
that

i
want
to
be
very
clear
the
government
will
not
take
away
your
guns
but
if
you
own
guns
you
will
be
forced
to
sell
them
to
the
government
in
yet
another
display
of
failing
mental
capacity

plain
lying
