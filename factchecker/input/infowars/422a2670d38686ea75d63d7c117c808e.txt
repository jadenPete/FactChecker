the
bill
of
rights
wouldn't
pass
in
today's
climate
i
run
into
people
every
day
who
would
like
to
see
so
much
of
those
guarantees
uprooted
house
majority
whip
james
clyburn
d-sc
said
that
the
bill
of
rights
would
not
pass
in
today's
climate
because
there
are
so
many
people
who
want
to
completely
uproot
the
freedoms
it
protects
appearing
on
msnbc
the
democrat
said
that
based
on
regular
conversations
he
had
with
people
there
would
be
strong
support
against
the
bill
of
rights
i
really
believe
sincerely
the
climate
that
we're
in
today
if
the
bill
of
rights
the
first
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution
were
put
before
the
public
today
i'm
not
too
sure
that
we
would
hold
onto
the
bill
of
rights
said
clyburn
especially
when
i
see
what
people
are
doing
with
the
second
amendment
and
no
telling
what
they
would
do
with
the
first
amendment
he
added
when
asked
by
a
surprised
david
gura
you
really
believe
that
that's
a
startling
statement
you
believe
that
clyburn
doubled
down
absolutely
he
replied
there
would
be
a
strong
support
against
the
bill
of
rights
go
through
the
bill
of
rights
and
i'll
tell
you
i
run
into
people
every
day
who
would
like
to
see
so
much
of
those
guarantees
uprooted
a
poll
found
that
only
just
over
a
quarter
of
americans
knew
how
many
amendments
made
up
the
bill
of
rights
another
poll
found
that
per
cent
of
americans
can't
name
any
of
the
rights
guaranteed
by
first
amendment
