old
themes
for
a
hundred
years
the
white
workers
of

the
most

white
workers
in

endured
the
worst
working
conditions
their
housing
was
abysmal
their
kids
went
to
the
most
backward
schools

very
few
could
send
their
children
to
college
but
what
did
they
have

listed
a

racial
stereotypes

said
motivated
supporters
of
welfare
reform
the
crown
jewel
of
the
republican
agenda
is
their
so-called
welfare
reform
proposal
the
bill
which
combines
an
assault
on
the
poor
women
and
children
minorities
and
immigrants
is
the
grand
slam
of
scapegoating
legislation
and
appeals
to
the
frustrations
and
ignorance
of
the
american
people
along
a
wide
spectrum
of
prejudices
tired
of
high
taxes
and
spending
huge
sums
of
money
on
people
too
lazy
to
work
tired
of
paying
black
teenagers
to
stay
home
all
day
and
have
babies
while
you
work
your
butt
off
tired
of
providing
an
incentive
for
mexicans
to
skip

is
for
