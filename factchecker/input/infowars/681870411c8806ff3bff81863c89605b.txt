september
while
the
outrage
was
largely
focused
towards
the
organization
because
of
their
beliefs
about
same-sex
marriage
brees
message
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
subject
even
if
it
did
it's
pathetic
that
christians
cannot
voice
their
opinions
without
being
bombarded
with
hate
by
virtue-signaling
liberals
brees
responded
to
critics
in
a
video
released
on

saying
hopefully
this
sets
the
record
straight
with
who
i
am
and
what
i
stand
for
love
respect
and
accept
all
i
encourage
you
not
to
believe
the
negativity
you
read
that
says
differently
it's
simply
not
true
have

the
saints
superstar's
full
response
below
there's
been
a
lot
of
negativity
spread
about
me
in
the
lgbtq
community
recently
based
upon
an
article
that
someone
wrote
with
a
very
negative
headline
that
i
think
led
people
to
believe
that
somehow
i
was
aligned
with
an
organization
that
was
anti-lgbtq
and
so
on
and
so
forth
i'd
like
to
set
the
record
straight
i
live
by
two
very
simple
christian
fundamentals
and
that
is
love
the
lord
with
all
your
heart
mind
and
soul
and
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
i
think
the
first
one
is
very
self-explanatory
the
second
one
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
what
does
that
mean
it
means
love
all
respect
all
and
accept
all
so
that
is
actually
how
i
live
my
life
that
is
what
i
try
to
do
with
my
family
with
my
teammates
with
people
in
my
community
with
my
friends
all
people
no
matter
your
race
your
color
your
religious
preference
your
sexual
orientation
your
political
views
when
asked
by
a
reporter
if
he
knew
about
the
group's
alleged
anti-lgbtq
stance
brees
said
he
was
unaware
of
any
lobbying
for
anti-gay
type
of
stuff
what's
a
shame
is
people
will
make
headlines
just
to
get
hits
just
to
get
views
and
all
of
a
sudden
these
rumors
spread
that
are
completely
untrue

this
is
yet
another
attack
on
christianity
as
infowars
has
documented
time
and
time
again
for
example
the
world's
top
rugby
player
israel
folau
nearly
lost
his
career
over
social
media
posts
expressing
his
religious
views
and
a
christian
mp
in
finland
is
being
investigated
for
a
hate
crime
after
she
posted
an
image
with
bible
verses
to
social
media
last
week
owen
shroyer
predicted
a
surge
of
pro-athletes
speaking
their
minds
whether
it
be
on
religion
alternative-health
conservatism
or
any
other
taboo
subject
watch
shroyer's
prediction
in
the
following
