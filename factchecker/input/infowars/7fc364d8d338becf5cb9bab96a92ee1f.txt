said
the
shooter
was
in

illegally

that
he
was
previously
in

that
sanctuary
policies
kept
law
enforcement
from
deporting
the
criminal
alien
this
person
is
not
a
legal
citizen
within
the
united
states
we
had
him
in
our
custody
in
january
of
this
year
and
because
of
the
folks
in
sacramento
limiting
our
ability
to
cooperate
with
ice
we
could
not
turn
him
over

the
california
senate
bill
signed
by
former
democrat
gov
jerry
brown
is
the
piece
of
legislation
that
is
keeping
law
enforcement
from
cooperating
with
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
on
the
arrests
of
illegals
the
state's
current
democrat
gov
gavin
newsom
is
upholding
the
sanctuary
status
even
saying
california
will
provide
sanctuary
to
all
who
seek
it
during
his
inaugural
speech
however
not
all
californians
are
satisfied
with
the
state's
liberal
policies
as
sheriff
warnke
made
clear
when
he
said
bottom
line
is
our
immigration
policies
need
to
be
revamped
because
we're
gonna
continue
to
have
more
of
this
situation
happen
we
knew
ahead
of
time
this
guy's
potential
for
violence
was
there
there
must
be
some
sort
of
accountability
for
those
giving
criminal
illegal
aliens
a
safe
space
to
continue
breaking
the
law
