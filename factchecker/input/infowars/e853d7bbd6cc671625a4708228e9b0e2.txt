adolescents
with
higher
levels
of
physical
activity
performed
better
in
school
during
transition
from
primary
school
to
lower
secondary
school
than
their
physically
inactive
peers
a
new
study
from
finland
shows
however
the
researchers
from
the
university
of
jyv
skyl
found
that
increased
physical
activity
did
not
necessarily
result
in
improved
academic
performance
previous
cross-sectional
studies
have
reported
that
physically
more
active
children
and
adolescents
achieve
better
school
grades
than
their
less
active
peers
do
but
there
are
few
longitudinal
studies
on
the
topic
a
newly
published
study
showed
that
adolescents
with
higher
levels
of
physical
activity
over
a
follow-up
period
of
two
academic
years
had
higher
academic
performance
than
did
those
who
were
continuously
inactive
furthermore
the
study
showed
that
increased
levels
of
physical
activity
do
not
automatically
result
in
improved
academic
performance
instead
the
results
suggest
that
those
adolescents
who
increased
their
physical
activity
had
lower
academic
performance
during
the
follow-up
compared
to
their
more
active
peers

what
the
results
mean
highly
active
adolescents
performed
better
in
school
compared
to
their
less
active
peers
however
our
results
showed
that
increasing
physical
activity
over
a
period
of
two
academic
years
did
not
necessarily
improve
academic
performance
what
the
results
do
not
mean
based
on
our
results
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
physical
activity
improves
academic
performance
or
if
adolescents
with
higher
academic
performance
choose
a
physically
active
lifestyle
therefore
no
causal
interpretations
can
be
made
however
the
results
of
the
present
study
do
not
refute
the
findings
of
previous
studies
showing
small
but
positive
effects
of
physical
activity
on
learning
and
its
neural
underpinnings
the
link
between
physical
activity
and
academic
performance
do
not
always
reflect
a
causal
relationship
it
is
possible
that
high
levels
of
physical
activity
and
good
academic
performance
share
the
same
attributes
such
as
high
motivation
towards
the
task
at
hand
says
eero
haapala
postdoctoral
researcher
from
the
university
of
jyv
skyl
the
study
investigated
the
longitudinal
associations
of
physical
activity
with
academic
performance
in
adolescents
who
were
between
and
years
old
at
baseline
physical
activity
was
assessed
using
a
questionnaire
and
school
grades
were
acquired
from
the
school
registers
several
confounding
factors
such
as
parental
education
and
pubertal
status
were
controlled
for
in
the
analyses
