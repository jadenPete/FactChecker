captured
by
nasa's

space
observatory
generated
by
some
of
the

a
new
study
published
in
the
astrophysical
journal
offers
some
possible
explanations
for
the
surprise
appearance
of
the
green
source
near
the
center
of
the
galaxy
which
came
into
view
and
disappeared
in
a
matter
of
weeks
the
primary
objective
of
the
nustar
observations
was
to
study
the
supernova
the
explosion
of
a
star
much
more
massive
than
our
sun
that
appears
as
a
bright
blue-green
spot
at
upper

these
violent
events
can
briefly
produce
enough
visible
light
to
outshine
entire
galaxies
consisting
of
billions
of
stars
they
also
generate
many
of
the
chemical
elements
in
our
universe
that
are
heavier

iron
nasathe
green
blob
near
the
bottom
of
the
galaxy
wasn't
visible
during
the
first
nustar
observation
but
was
burning
bright
at
the
start
of
a
second
observation
days
later
nasa's
chandra
x-ray
observatory
later
observed
that
the
source
known
as
an
ultraluminous
x-ray
source
or
ulx
had
disappeared
just
as
quickly
the
object
has
since
been
named
ulx-
because
it
is
the
fourth
ulx
identified
in
this
galaxy
no
visible
light
was
detected
with
the
x-ray
source
a
fact
that
most
likely
rules
out
the
possibility
that
it
is
also
a
supernova
ten
days
is
a
really
short
amount
of
time
for
such
a
bright
object
to
appear
said
hannah
earnshaw
a
postdoctoral
researcher
at
caltech
in
pasadena
california
and
lead
author
on
the
new
study
usually
with
nustar
we
observe
more
gradual
changes
over
time
and
we
don't
often
observe
a
source
multiple
times
in
quick
succession
in
this
instance
we
were
fortunate
to
catch
a
source
changing
extremely
quickly
which
is
very
exciting
possible
black
hole
the
new
study
explores
the
possibility
that
the
light
came
from
a
black
hole
consuming
another
object
such
as
a
star
if
an
object
gets
too
close
to
a
black
hole
gravity
can
pull
that
object
apart
bringing
the
debris
into
a
close
orbit
around
the
black
hole
material
at
the
inner
edge
of
this
newly
formed
disk
starts
moving
so
fast
that
it
heats
up
to
millions
of
degrees
and
radiates
x-rays
the
surface
of
the
sun
by
comparison
is
about
degrees
fahrenheit
or
degrees
celsius
most
ulxs
are
typically
long-lived
because
they're
created
by
a
dense
object
like
a
black
hole
that
feeds
on
the
star
for
an
extended
period
of
time
short-lived
or
transient
x-ray
sources
like
ulx-
are
far
more
rare
so
a
single
dramatic
event
like
a
black
hole
quickly
destroying
a
small
star
might
explain
the
observation
however
ulx-
might
not
be
a
one-off
event
and
the
paper's
authors
explored
other
potential
explanations
for
this
object
one
possibility
the
source
of
ulx-
could
be
a
neutron
star
neutron
stars
are
extremely
dense
objects
formed
from
the
explosion
of
a
star
that
wasn't
massive
enough
to
form
a
black
hole
with
about
the
same
mass
as
our
sun
but
packed
into
an
object
about
the
size
of
a
large
city
neutron
stars
can
like
black
holes
draw
in
material
and
create
a
fast-moving
disk
of
debris
these
can
also
generate
slow-feeding
ultraluminous
x-ray
sources
although
the
x-ray
light
is
produced
through
slightly
different
processes
than
in
ulxs
created
by
black
holes
neutron
stars
generate
magnetic
fields
so
strong
they
can
create
columns
that
channel
material
down
to
the
surface
generating
powerful
x-rays
in
the
process
but
if
the
neutron
star
spins
especially
fast
those
magnetic
fields
can
create
a
barrier
making
it
impossible
for
material
to
reach
the
star's
surface
it
would
kind
of
be
like
trying
to
jump
onto
a
carousel
that's
spinning
at
thousands
of
miles
per
hour
said
earnshaw
the
barrier
effect
would
prevent
the
star
from
being
a
bright
source
of
x-rays
except
for
those
times
when
the
magnetic
barrier
might
waver
briefly
allowing
material
to
slip
through
and
fall
onto
the
neutron
star's
surface
this
could
be
another
possible
explanation
for
the
sudden
appearance
and
disappearance
of
ulx-
if
the
same
source
were
to
light
up
again
it
might
support
this
hypothesis
this
result
is
a
step
towards
understanding
some
of
the
rarer
and
more
extreme
cases
in
which
matter
accretes
onto
black
holes
or
neutron
stars
