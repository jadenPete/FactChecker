market
infrastructure
leader

kong
exchange
said
in
a
statement
hkex
is
fully
committed
to
supporting
and
building
the
long-term
roles
of
both
london
and
hong
kong
as
global
financial
centers
it
added
the
lse
has
long
sought
to
improve
its
presence
in
asia
and
recently
launched
a
link
scheme
with
hkex
competitor
shanghai
the
hong
kong
offer
however
is
contingent
on
the
lse
not
merging
with
the
uk-based
data
company
refinitiv
the
lse
said
it
would
review
the

is
crashing
the

created
worldwide
benificial
for
both
exchanges
the
takeover
bid
comes
as

set
to
leave

european
union
a
step
many
analysts
say
could
weaken
its
position
as
a
major
financial
center
in
the
world
potential
barriers
could
make
it
harder
for
britain
to
trade
in
the
rest
of
europe
but
the
hong
kong
stock
exchange
said
the
merger
would
strengthen
both
exchanges
strategic
positions
as
offshore
hubs
for
trading
in
eurodollars
and
renminbi
while
also
offering
the
uk
a
bigger
presence
into
mainland
china
the
merger
would
create
a
world-leading
global
exchange
that
spans
asia
europe
and
the
united
states
with
a
market
value
of
more
than
billion
dollars
according

by

the
offer
from
hong

follows
a
bid
to
merge
the
london
stock
exchange
and
the
deutsche
boerse
which
was
blocked
by
the
european
commission
in
after
two
other
failed
attempts
