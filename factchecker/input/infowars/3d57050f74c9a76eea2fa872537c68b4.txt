ever
wonder
why
america
celebrates
labor
day
here
are
its
origins
labor
day
became
official
on
a
federal
level
when
former
president
grover
cleveland
signed
the
law
making
it
a
national
holiday
while
many
americans
see
labor
day
as
an
early
day
off
school
or
long
weekend
spent
eating
hamburgers
drinking
beer
and
swimming
in
the
pool
before
it
closes
its
origins
were
chaotic
there
is
some
dispute
over
the
exact
point
in
history
labor
day
became
an
idea
but
it
goes
back
in
part
to
manhattan
on
sept
when
the
central
labor
union
and
thousands
of
workers
went
on
strike
as
they
paraded
through
the
city
twelve
years
later
a
bloody
demonstration
displayed
even
more
unrest
among
workers
in
pullman
illinois
the
chicago
company
town
was
founded
by
george
pullman
president
of
the
pullman
railroad
sleeping
car
for
the
workers
who
manufactured
his
products
assembly
workers
lived
in
row
houses
managers
lived
in
modest
victorian-style
homes
and
pullman
lived
in
a
lavish
hotel
according
to
pbs
pullman
row

residents
paychecks
came
from
pullman
bank
and
george
pullman
set
rent
prices
for
his
workers
which
were
deducted
automatically
from
their
weekly
paychecks
pbs
reported
the
little
utopia
operated
smoothly
until
about
when
an
economic
depression
hit
and
pullman
decided
to
lay
off
hundreds
of
employees
and
cut
workers
wages
by
about
without
cutting
their
rent
prices
business
insider
reported
the
result
was
an
employee
strike
that
had
the
backing
of
the
american
railway
union
under
socialist
eugene
debs
in
the
union
had
between
and
members
who
refused
to
work
until
their
wages
increased
and
rents
decreased
causing
a
nationwide
backlog
of
undelivered
mail
and
transportation
nightmare
according
to
time
some
members
of
the
union
who
were
attending
a
debs
speech
in
blue
island
illinois
set
buildings
in
the
area
on
fire
and
derailed
a
mail
train
locomotive
june
the
pullman
strike
laying
the
track
to
modern
labor
rights
stephen

this
was
the
turning
point
because
it
enjoined
the
aru
and
debs
from
doing
anything
to
support
or
direct
the
strike
indiana
state
university
history
professor
richard
schneirov
told
history
labor
has
for
much
of
its
history
been
hemmed
in
by
injunctions
but
the
pullman
injunction
was
the
first
big
instance
where
it
really
came
to
the
attention
of
the
public
then-president
grover
cleveland
stepped
in
a
day
after
the
june
incident
under
pressure
from
railroad
and
postal
service
companies
to
get
business
back
on
track
cleveland
declared
the
strike
a
federal
crime
and
deployed
troops
to
pullman
in
an
attempt
to
break
up
demonstrations
the
whole
thing
is
the
most
one-sided
biased
action
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
in
a
labor
dispute
that
you
could
think
of
schneirov
told
business
insider
bloodshed
and
violence
erupted
during
a
chicago
strike
july
and
killing
between
and
people
the
strike
became
nationwide
news
and
more
protests
against
cleveland's
decision
to
send
troops
to
chicago
took
place
across
the
country
from
the
crash
of
to
the
pullman
strike
thesocialstudiesguy

cleveland
signed
a
bill
june
to
make
labor
day
a
national
holiday
before
sending
more
troops
to
chicago
by
making
one
day
in
each
year
a
public
holiday
for
the
benefit
of
workingmen
the
equality
and
dignity
of
labor
is
emphasized
nothing
is
more
important
to
the
public
weal
than
that
the
nobility
of
labor
be
maintained
so
long
as
the
laboring
man
can
feel
that
he
holds
an
honorable
as
well
as
useful
place
in
the
body
politic
so
long
will
he
be
a
loyal
and
faithful
citizen
the
bill
reads
the
strike
officially
ended
in
august
