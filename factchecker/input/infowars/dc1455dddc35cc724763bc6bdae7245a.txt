the
once

conducted
the
initial
agency

of
disgraced
ex-fbi

james
comey's

strzok
told
the
fbi
that
it
made
sense
that
this

conducted
the
initial

review
because

had
a
lot
of
history
and
experience
of
working
investigations
relating
to
the
disclosure
of
classified
information
including
the
fbi's
clinton
email
investigation
that
would
be
the

investigation
that
