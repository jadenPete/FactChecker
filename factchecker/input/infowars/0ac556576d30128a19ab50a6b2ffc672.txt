said
new
statistics
exposed
a

sense
of

in
the

since

the

desire
to
dominate
and

the
so-called
kleiner

small
weapons
permit
is
relatively
easy
to
acquire
in
germany
they
are
usually
available
to
anyone
over
with
no
previous
serious
criminal
convictions
and
who
is
considered
physically
and
mentally
fit
the
permits
allow
people
to
carry
a
gas
pistol
that
fires
loud
blanks
in
public
though
such
pistols
can
be
kept
at
home
without
a
license
experts
have
warned
that
they
closely
resemble
real
firearms
and
can
still
be
lethal
at
very
close
range
and
malchow
also
warned
against
potential
problems
created
by
the
abundance
of
starting
pistols

he

this
is
precisely
what

a

a

be

he
added
the
newspaper
which
compiled
the
data
from

ministries
from
all
german
states
said
that
some
million
real

were
owned
privately
in

in

more
than
the
year
before
these
were
mostly
rifles
