populism's
critics
are
professional
deviants
a
look
into
the
people
who
oppose
trump
it's
always
the
people
that
have
less
than
zero
room
to
talk
that
come
barreling
out
of
nowhere
to
attack
trump
with
full
cartloads
of
bs
for
example
mick
jagger
recently
blamed
trump
for
tearing
apart
environment
controls
when
america
should
be
setting
the
standard
for
the
world
of
course
his
royal
satanic
majesty
doesn't
understand
those
controls
include
something
found
in
the
fine
print
of
the
un
climate
summit
known
as
loss
and
damage
but
who
can
expect
a
satanist
who
made
a
film
with
crowley
acolyte
kenneth
anger
and
future
manson
murderer
bobby
beausoleil
to
understand
anything
outside
of
what
his
social
circle
of
vampires
tells
him
and
then
there
is
former
south
carolina
gov
mark
sanford
who
has
announced
that
he
will
run
as
a
republican
against
trump
sanford
attacked
trump
for
his
transgressions
while
brushing
aside
the
fact
that
he
covered
up
an
affair
he
was
having
with
his
argentinian
mistress
by
claiming
he
had
been
hiking
the
appalachian
trail
add
to
this
motley
crew
disgraced
former
trump
press
secretary
anthony
scaramucci
who
is
desperately
clinging
to
his
fifteen
minutes
of
fame
and
then
there's
the
field
of
democratic
candidate
madness
towing
the
same
cringe-worthy
attacks
we
have
all
grown
to
loathe
even
the
almighty
king
of
morality
and
truth
snopes
founder
david
mikkelson
allegedly
embezzled
for
prostitutes
during
his
divorce
i
ask
you
has
any
decent
person
stood
up
in
opposition
to
president
trump's
populist
uprising
