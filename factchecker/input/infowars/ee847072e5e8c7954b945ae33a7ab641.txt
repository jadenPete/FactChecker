at

pace
central

fueling

corporations
are
piling
on
the
debt
last
week
companies
borrowed
billion
in
the
us
investment-grade
bond
market
it
was
the
largest
corporate
debt
increase
for
any
comparable
period
since
they
started
tracking
such
things
in
according
to
bloomberg
there
is
no
sign
the
borrowing
binge
will
let
up
analysts
expect
corporations
to
borrow
another
billion
through
the
rest
of
the
month
borrowing
activity
is
also
spilling
over
into
junk
bonds
and
leveraged
loans
as
well
there
was
a
billion
increase
in
the
us
leveraged
loan
market
last
week
leveraged
loans
are
made
to
firms
already
deeply
in
debt
think
subprime
loans
for
corporations
as
with
any
risky
loan
they
could
be
difficult
to
either
collect
or
resell
in
a
downturn
putting
both
the
borrower
and
lender
at
risk
investment-grade
debt
outstanding
totaled
trillion
as
of
sept
more
than
double
the
level
a
decade
ago
this
isn't
just
an
american
phenomenon
global
corporate
borrowing
also
set
a
record
of
billion
last
week
the
federal
reserve
is
crashing
the
debt
real
estate
bubble
it
created
worldwide
low
bond
yields
are
helping
drive
the
borrowing
spree
negative-yielding
debt
topped
trillion
globally
for
the
first
time
ever
last
month
and
it
has
since
climbed
to
over
trillion
this
pile
of
negatively
yielding
paper
includes
government
and
corporate
bonds
along
with
some
euro
junk
bonds
wolfstreet
called
it
a
race
to
hell
as
the
financial
times
put
it
negative
bond
yields
were
once
considered
to
be
economic
lunacy
now
they
are
economic
normalcy
central
banks
are
fueling
the
borrowing
fire
and
the
world
is
about
to
experience
another
round
of
monetary
easing
most
analysts
expect
the
ecb
to
push
rates
lower
during
its
september
meeting
and
possibly
restart
quantitative
easing
next
week
the
federal
reserve
is
widely
expected
to
nudge
rates
down
another
basis
points
the
fed
issued
a
warning
about
rising
corporate
debt
last
spring
borrowing
by
businesses
is
historically
high
relative
to
gross
domestic
product
gdp
with
the
most
rapid
increases
in
debt
concentrated
among
the
riskiest
firms
amid
signs
of
deteriorating
credit
standards
according
to
the
fed
the
growth
in
business
debt
has
outpaced
gdp
growth
for
the
last
decade
although
debt-financing
costs
are
low
the
elevated
level
of
debt
could
leave
the
business
sector
vulnerable
to
a
downturn
in
economic
activity
or
a
tightening
in
financial
conditions
note
that
tightening
financial
conditions
means
rising
interest
rates
this
explains
exactly
why
the
federal
reserve
abandoned
any
pretense
of
interest
rate
normalization
and
why
donald
trump
keeps
badgering
powell
and
company
for
even
lower
rates
economies
built
on
debt
don't
do
well
when
interest
rates
rise

chairman
jay
clayton
issued
a
warning
about
corporate
debt
this
week
during
a
speech
he
noted
that
outstanding
corporate
debt
in
the
us
stands
at
almost
trillion
that's
nearly
of
gdp
those
are
numbers
that
should
attract
our
attention
corporate
debt
isn't
the
only
problem
american
consumers
are
propping
up
the
us
economy
with
money
they
don't
have
total
outstanding
consumer
debt
surged
over
trillion
in
the
second
quarter
of
over
the
last
months
alone
american
consumers
have
piled
on
an
additional
billion
of
debt
revolving
credit
primarily
credit
card
debt
increased
at
an
annual
rate
of
in
q
americans
currently
owe
trillion
on
their
plastic
this
was
a
record
for
a
second
quarter
and
was
only
topped
by
the
holiday
shop-and-borrow
season
in
q
the
mainstream
continues
to
shrug
its
shoulders
and
look
the
other
way
when
it
comes
to
the
rising
sea
of
global
debt
but
as
we've
said
over
and
over
again
depending
on
borrowing
to
drive
your
economy
isn't
a
sustainable
strategy
at
some
point
the
debt
has
to
be
repaid
and
the
central
planners
can't
keep
interest
rates
at
zero
forever
economies
need
savings
and
capital
investment
for
real
long-term
growth
this
debt
bubble
will
pop
and
when
it
does
it's
going
to
get
ugly
alex
jones
breaks
down
how
globalist
banking
forces
are
conspiring
to
create
the
illusion
that
along
with
populists
nationalists
and
the
policies
they
advocate
comes
financial
ruin
and
collapse
to
convince
populations
that
globalization
is
their
salvation
