actually
did
something
right
for
a
change
the
european
union
has
been
branded
fascist
for
having
the
temerity
to
to
create
a
united
nations
role
called
commissioner
for
protecting
our
european
way
of
life
how
dare
they
the
new
role
which
will
oversee
immigration
policy
was
announced
by
incoming
eu
commission
president
ursula

and
will
be
filled
by

schinas
reports
zero
hedge
leftists
immediately
reacted
with
outrage
completely
apoplectic
that
anyone
would
wish
to
protect
western
culture
this
looks
like
the
portfolio
to
fight
back
against
the
rise
of
the
fascists
but
only
by
adopting
their
divisive
rhetoric
around
strong
borders

dutch
mep

told
the

the
very
point
about
the
european
way
of
life
is
the
freedom
for
individuals
to
chose
their
own
way
of

we
do
not
need
a
commissioner
for
that
thank
you
very
much
she
went
on
to
describe
the
idea
that
europeans

as
grotesque
veld
claimed
that
populist
leaders
in
europe
were
the
only
real
threat
to
our
way
of
life
in
other
words
the
the
globalist
european
union
is
being
savaged
by
the
left
for
one
of
the
few
positive
things
it
has
ever
done
in
its
entire
history
it's
completely
acceptable
to
encourage
the
protection
of
every
other
culture
in
the
world
apart
from
western
culture
which
is
inherently
bad
and
evil
in
which

from
all
those
other
cultures
so
desperate
