the
good
news
is
that
we
are
winning
our
real
opponent
is
not
the
democrats
or
the
dwindling
number
of
republicans
that
lost
their
way
and
got
left
behind
our
primary
opponent
is
the
fake
news
media
in
the
history
of
our
country
they
have
never
been
so
bad
donald

the
president
also
hit
out
against
the
amazon
washington
post
for
reporting
that
trump's
words
have
encouraged
racist
attacks
against
the
squad
of
democrats
the
amazon
washington
post
did
a
story
that
i
brought
racist
attacks
against
the
squad
no
they
brought
racist
attacks
against
our

all
i
do
is
call
them
out
for
the
horrible
things
they
have
said
the
democrats
have
become
the
party
of
the
squad
donald

the
president
also
slammed
abc
news
for
airing
an
edited
clip
of
trump
saying
that
even
alabama
could
be
affected
by
hurricane
dorian
such
a
phony
hurricane
report
by
lightweight
reporter
jonkarl
of
abcworldnews
i
suggested
yesterday
at
fema
that
along
with
florida
georgia
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
even
alabama
could
possibly
come
into
play
which
was
true
they
made
a
big
deal
about
this
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
september
when
in
fact
under
certain
original
scenarios
it
was
in
fact
correct
that
alabama
could
have
received
some
hurt
always
good
to
be
prepared
but
the
fake
news
is
only
interested
in
demeaning
and
belittling
didn't
play
my
whole
sentence
or
statement
bad
people
donald

trump
realdonaldtrump
september
a
report
from
axios
over
the
weekend
suggested
that
a
key
focus
of
the
trump
campaign
will
be
railing
against
big
tech's
bias
against
conservatives
now
i
know
why
the
left
doesn't

the
report
cited
an
anonymous
source
inside
the
administration
who
suggested
people
feel
they're
being
manipulated
whether
it's
by
what
they're
being
shown
in
their
feeds
or
actions
the
companies
have
taken
against
conservatives
it's
easy
for
people
to
understand
how
these
giant
corporations
could
influence
them
and
direct
them
toward
a
certain
favored
candidate

source
also
