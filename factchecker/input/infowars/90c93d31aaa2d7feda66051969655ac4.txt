democratic
socialism
is
a
cancer
will
america
let
it
metastasize
until
the
country
is
in
ruins
as
the
saying
goes
a
spoonful
of
sugar
helps
the
medicine
or
poison
in
this
case
go
down
so
it
is
with
the
term
democratic
socialism
because
socialism
without
the
democratic
beard
is
simply
an
autocratic
dictatorship
where
individual
freedom
is
crushed
and
the
production
of
goods
and
services
is
driven
by
a
bureaucracy
of
minders
rather
than
an
open
and
free
market
as
the
los
angeles
daily
news
recently
surmised
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
therefore
that
the
nature
of
socialist
countries
in
history
has
been
to
accumulate
political
power
and
not
surrender
it
once
obtained
a
capitalist
economy
by
contrast
is
comfortable
with
changes
in
power
the
time
to
be
aloof
about
socialism
and
communism
entering
the
republic
like
cancer
is
over
according
to
the
victims
of
communism
memorial
foundation's
annual
report
on
u.s.
attitudes
toward
socialism
percent
of
the
up-and-coming
generation
opted
for
one
of
the
three
systems
compared
to
percent
who
said
they
were
in
favor
of
capitalism
the
most
popular
socioeconomic
order
was
socialism
with
percent
support
communism
and
fascism
received
percent
support
each
as
the
washington
examiner
reported
the
gallup
poll
revealed
a
plurality
understood
socialism
to
mean
equality
equal
standing
for
everybody
all
equal
in
rights
equal
in
distribution
compared
to
only
who
understood
it
as
government
ownership
at
this
rate
as
the
numbers
of
socialist
democrats
in
the
u.s.
congress
swell
and
the
socialist
democratic
propaganda
feeds
our
populace
america
like
the
titanic
will
slam
into
the
ice
if
it
doesn't
heed
the
diminishing
voices
of
independent
journalists
it
was
just
one
hour
before
the
titanic's
collision
at
p
m
when
the
vessel
known
as
the
californian
messaged
to
the
titanic
stating
we
are
stopped
and
surrounded
by
ice
and
the
titanic
responded
shut
