senator
floats
blasey
ford
probe
after
lawyer
boasts
of
undermining
kavanaugh
this
does
seem
to
undermine
what
we
all
believed
was
a
legitimate
traumatic
experience
in
her
life
says
tom
tillis
gop
sen
thom
tillis
said
a
new
investigation
into
dr
christine
blasey
ford's
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
against
justice
brett
kavanaugh
may
be
appropriate
in
light
of
a
new
book
suggesting
she
had
political
motives
the
north
carolina
republican
a
member
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
told
fox
news
that
new
video
of
ford's
lawyer
connecting
her
allegations
with
the
broader
fight
over
abortion
rights
undermines
ford's
credibility
and
could
necessitate
the
justice
department's
intervention
this
does
seem
to
undermine
what
we
all
believed
was
a
legitimate
traumatic
experience
in
her
life
tillis
said
we'll
just
let
the
process
play
out
but
clearly
a
misrepresentation
before
a
senate
committee
is
a
very
serious
offense
hopefully
we
can
get
past
that
we
have
to
always
make
sure
that
when
people
come
and
give
sworn
testimony
before
any
congressional
committee
that
it's
truthful
and
accurate
tillis
added
any
time
that
you
see
something
like
this
it's
probably
worth
looking
into
speaking
at
the
university
of
baltimore
in
april
ford
lawyer
debra
katz
said
questions
as
to
kavanaugh's
legitimacy
will
linger
far
into
the
future
diminishing
kavanaugh's
reputation
is
part
of
what
motivated
ford
to
come
forward
katz
said
news
of
her
remarks
first
appeared
in
the
new
book
search
and
destroy
inside
the
campaign
against
brett
kavanaugh
by
the
national
law
journal's
ryan
lovelace
he
will
always
have
an
asterisk
next
to
his
name
katz
said
of
kavanaugh
when
he
takes
a
scalpel
to
roe
v
wade
we
will
know
who
he
is
we
know
his
character
and
we
know
what
motivates
him
and
that
is
important
it
is
important
that
we
know
and
that
is
part
of
what
motivated
christine
katz
also
panned
the
misogynist
republican
who
confirmed
kavanaugh
to
the
high
court
a
dispute
from
louisiana
relating
to
state
regulations
on
abortion
providers
is
currently
pending
before
the
supreme
court
christine
blasey
ford
has
been
caught
in
several
lies
during
her
testimony
given
to
the
senate
she
claimed
she
has
a
fear
of
flying
and
that
she
had
never
been
coached
on
taking
a
polygraph
both
claims
that
have
been
proven
false
also
others
have
sworn
statements
that
refute
her
version
of
events
