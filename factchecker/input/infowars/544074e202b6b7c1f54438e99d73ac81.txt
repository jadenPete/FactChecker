surveys
which
prove
that
americans
never
want
to
go
back
to
the
way
america
used
to
be
our
country
will
be
greatly
rattled
in
the
years
ahead
and
that
process
will
wake
many
from
their
slumber
for
a
long
time
a
great
battle
has
been
fought
to
determine
the
future
direction
of
this
country
and
at
this
point
one
thing
has
become
exceedingly
clear
america
is
never
going
to
be
the
country
that
it
once
was
of
course
for
millions
of
americans
this
is
actually
very
welcome
news
but
for
those
of
us
that
have
been
working
so
hard
for
so
long
to
restore
the
values
that
this
nation
was
founded
upon
it
is
incredibly
sad
to
finally
come
to
this
realization
in
order
for
america
to
return
to
her
glory
days
our
nation
would
need
to
embrace
the
values
that
once
made
our
nation
so
great
and
the
truth
is
that
the
american
people
have
resoundingly
rejected
those
values
this
is
especially
true
for
our
young
people
and
it
won't
be
too
long
before
they
are
running
everything
the
other
side
has
control
of
our
education
system
of
our
major
media
outlets
of
our
entertainment
industry
and
of
our
legal
system
they
are
literally
systematically
training
future
generations
what
to
think
and
that
has
proven
to
be
an
insurmountable
advantage
the
culture
war
has
been
over
for
a
long
time
and
they
won
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
broader
conflict
is
over
a
lot
of
people
reading
this
article
will
be
tempted
to
think
that
this
is
a
republican
democrat
thing
but
that
is
not
true
at
all
in
fact
the
truth
is
that
many
lawmakers
that
are
considered
to
be
conservatives
today
would
be
considered
to
be
flaming
liberals
by
our
founders
ultimately
nearly
all
of
our
political
leaders
have
fundamentally
rejected
the
values
that
so
many
previous
generations
of
americans
fought
so
hard
to
defend
the
united
states
has
been
overthrown
but
it
wasn't
by
a
foreign
power
we
have
been
conquered
from
within
and
it
was
a
very
slow
process
but
now
their
victory
is
almost
entirely
complete
if
you
doubt
this
i
would
like
for
you
to
take
a
few
moments
to
consider
the
following
numbers
the
following
are
surveys
which
prove
that
americans
never
want
to
go
back
to
the
way
america
used

when
asked
to
name
the
greatest
president
in
their
lifetimes
more
americans
named
barack
obama
than
anyone
else
by
a
wide
margin
percent
of
american
adults
under
the
age
of
agree
that
some
version
of
socialism
would
be
good
for
the
country
one
survey
discovered
that
one-third
of
all
american
teenagers
haven't
read
a
single
book
in
the
past
year
almost
one-third
of
all
u.s.
millennials
are
still
living
with
their
parents
one
very
alarming
survey
found
that
the
average
american
spends
hours
a
month
on
a
cellphone
percent
of
americans
say
that
not
having
wifi
would
ruin
their
vacation
percent
of
pet-owning
adults
in
the
united
states
say
that
their
pet
is
their
favorite
child
according
to
a
quinnipiac
university
poll
from
last
year
percent
of
all
americans
want
to
keep
roe
v
wade
in
place
according
to
the
pew
research
center
percent

college
students
believe
that
the
phrase
in
god
we
trust
should

from
our
currency
over
the
last
three
decades
the
number
of
americans
with
no
religion
has
increased
by
percent
during
the
election
more
than
percent
of
americans
did
not
know
who
was
running
for
vice-president
from
either
of
the
major
parties
only
percent
of
americans
can
name
all
three
branches
of
government
one
very
shocking
survey
found
that
percent
of
americans
don't
even
know
how
many
amendments
are
in
the
bill
of
rights
according
to
a
survey
that
was
conducted
last
year
americans
from
the
age
of
to
the
age
of
favor
democrats
over
republicans
by
a
percent
to
percent
margin
once
again
this
is
not
a
republican
democrat
thing
ultimately
both
major
political
parties
seem
determined
to
take
us
down
the
tubes
one
may
want
to
do
it
at
a
faster
pace
than
the
other
but
the
destination
is
still
the
same
i
know
that
some
will
dismiss
me
as
an
out
of
touch
pessimist
but
i
did
not
come
to
these
conclusions
lightly
in
fact
not
too
long
ago
i
spent
an
entire
year
talking
to
voters
and
trying
to
do
what
i
could
to
point
the
country
in
the
right
direction
but
i
discovered
that
only
a
very
small
remnant
actually
wants
to
go
in
the
right
direction
if
george
washington
john
adams
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
were
around
today
they
would
all
be
considered
dangerous
extremists
and
none
of
them
would
have
a
prayer
of
actually
getting
elected
to
public
office
i
am
certainly
not
giving
up
and
you
shouldn't
either
in
fact
my
wife
and
i
believe
that
the
most
exciting
chapters
of
our
lives
are
right
around
the
corner
but
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
our
choices
are
going
to
have
very
severe
consequences
the
past
few
years
represented
yet
another
opportunity
to
amend
our
ways
but
instead
the
american
people
have
been
running
in
the
opposite
direction
as
rapidly
as
they
can
our
country
will
be
greatly
rattled
in
the
years
ahead
and
that
process
will
wake
many
from
their
slumber
let
us
use
that
time
to
win
one
heart
at
a
time
and
let
us
be
thankful
that
we
were
born
into
such
a
critical
time
in
history
