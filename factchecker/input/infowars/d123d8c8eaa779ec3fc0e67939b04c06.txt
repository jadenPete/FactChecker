they
can't

the
truth
homan
called
bigot
inhumane
at
house
hearing
former
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
director
tom
homan
blasted
house
democrats
following
a
high-intensity
congressional
hearing
this
week
homan
was
called
a
bigot
as
well
as
ruthless
and
inhumane
by
democrats
during
testimony
to
the
house
oversight
civil
rights
and
civil
liberties
subcommittee
on
wednesday
i
did
it
when
i
was
ice
director
that's
why
i
took
so
much
hate
as
the
ice
director
because
i
wasn't
gonna
play
political
games
homan
explained
during
an
appearance
on
fox
and
friends
i
wanted
to
do
my
job
and
tell
the
american
people
what
we
do
and
what
we
don't
do
and
tell
them
the
truth
but
the
democratic
leadership
in
congress
can't
handle
the
truth
during
his
testimony
homan
was
attacked
by
multiple
democrat
lawmakers
including
rep
debbie
wasserman-schultz
d-fla
i
think
it's
important
to
really
make
sure
that
the
jingoistic
bigoted
testimony
of
mr
homan
is
called
out
as
nearly
completely
untrue
as
being
an
outrage
and
as
a
former
official
directing
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
he
should
know
better

trump's
lack
of
new

wall
highlights
the
need
for
security
in
light
of
focused
efforts
to
collapse
borders
around
the
globe
