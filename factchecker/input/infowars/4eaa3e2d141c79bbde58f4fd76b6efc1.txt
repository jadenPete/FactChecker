australia
deploys
world's
first
law
to
fight
online
extremism
critics
say
law
difficult
to
enforce
in
the
first
application
of
a
controversial
new
law
passed
in
the
wake
of
the
march
terror
attacks
in
christchurch
new
zealand
australian
authorities
have
ordered
five
websites
to
remove
extremist
content
or
face
prosecution
according
to
the
financial
times
the
material
includes
video
taken
by
the
christchurch
attacker
as
well
as
videos
showing
the
beheading
of
a
scandinavian
tourist
in
morocco
all
five
sites
are
based
outside
australia
according
to
the
country's
esafety
commission
which
was
granted
the
power
to
investigate
and
order
the
removal
of
extremist
content
back
in
april
under
the
new
law
social
media
companies
websites
and
even
isps
can
be
fined
up
to
of
their
annual
revenue
or
see
their
chief
executives
sent
to
prison
if
they
fail
to
remove
abhorrent
or
extremist
material
julie
inman
grant
australia's
esafety
commissioner
said
on
monday
that
three
of
the
five
websites
canberra
was
targeting
had
taken
down
the
offensive
material
and
no
prosecutions
had
yet
been
initiated
she
said
the
decision
by
the
three
sites
showed
the
potential
of
threats
of
prosecution
and
fines
the
spy
grid
dragnet
system
is
already
in
place
and
being
used
against
the
public
these
are
fringe
websites
that
revel
in
gore
and
hatred
all
of
them
are
based
overseas
inman
grant
said
in
a
separate
move
canberra
ordered
australian
isps
to
block
access
to
eight
other
websites
that
continued
to
allow
access
to
the
video
of
the
christchurch
attacks
or
the
shooter's
manifesto
inman
grant
said
that
while
there
were
jurisdictional
challenges
involved
in
overseas
prosecutions
i
expect
in
the
next
five
years
we
will
see
a
proliferation
of
similar
regulators
seeking
to
do
the
same
thing
however
critics
of
the
law
say
australia's
ability
to
enforce
the
law
is
limited
a
lot
of
these
rogue
websites
are
mickey
mouse
operations
with
little
or
no
revenue
and
so
it's
very
hard
to
hold
them
to
account
said
fergus
hanson
a
cyber
security
expert
at
the
australian
security
policy
institute
a
canberra-based
think-tank
globalism
was
conceived
to
sabotage
the
renaissance
and
plunge
humanity
into
a
new
dark
age
