on
exoplanet
located

exoplanet
about
nine
times
bigger
than
earth
ever
since
the
discovery
of
the
first
exoplanet

astronomers
have
made
steady
progress
towards
finding
and
probing
planets
located
in
the
habitable
zone
of
their
stars
where
conditions
can
lead
to
the
formation
of
liquid
water
and
the
proliferation
of
life
results
from
the
kepler
satellite
mission
which
discovered
nearly
of
all
known
exoplanets
to
date
indicate
that
to
of
earths
and
super-earths
are
located
in
the
habitable
zone
of
their
stars
however
despite
this
abundance
probing
the
conditions
and
atmospheric
properties
on
any
of
these
habitable
zone
planets
is
extremely
difficult
and
has
remained
elusive
until
now
a
new
study
by
professor
bj
rn
benneke
of
the
institute
for
research
on
exoplanets
at
the
universit
de
montr
al
his
doctoral
student
caroline
piaulet
and
several
of
their
collaborators
reports
the
detection
of
water
vapour
and
perhaps
even
liquid
water
clouds
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
planet

this
exoplanet
is
about
nine
times
more
massive
than
our
earth
and
is
found
in
the
habitable
zone
of
the
star
it
orbits
this
m-type
star
is
smaller
and
cooler
than
our
sun
but
due
to
k
b's
close
proximity
to
its
star
the
planet
receives
almost
the
same
total
amount
of
energy
from
its
star
as
our
earth
receives
from
the
sun

viral
to
expose
the

space
program
given
preference
over
the
infrastructure
of
the
country
the
similarities
between
the
exoplanet
k
b
and
the
earth
suggest
to
astronomers
that
the
exoplanet
may
potentially
have
a
water
cycle
possibly
allowing
water
to
condense
into
clouds
and
liquid
water
rain
to
fall
this
detection
was
made
possible
by
combining
eight
transit
observations
the
moment
when
an
exoplanet
passes
in

of
its
star

by
the
hubble

telescope
the
universit
de
montr
al
is
no
stranger
to
the
k
system
located
light
years
away
the
existence
of
k
b
was
first
confirmed
by
prof
benneke
and
his
team
in
a
paper
using
data
from
the
spitzer
space
telescope
the
mass
and
radius
of
the
planet
were
then
determined
by
former
universit
de
montr
al
and
university
of
toronto
phd
student
ryan
cloutier
these
promising
initial
results
encouraged
the
irex
team
to
collect
follow-up
observations
of
the
intriguing
world
scientists
currently
believe
that
the
thick
gaseous
envelope
of
k
b
likely
prevents
life
as
we
know
it
from
existing
on
the
planet's
surface
however
the
study
shows
that
even
these
planets
of
relatively
low
mass
which
are
therefore
more
difficult
to
study
can
be
explored
using
astronomical
instruments
developed
in
recent
years
by
studying
these
planets
which
are
in
the
habitable
zone
of
their
star
and
have
the
right
conditions
for
liquid
water
astronomers
are
one
step
closer
to
directly
detecting
signs
of
life
beyond
our
solar
system
this
represents
the
biggest
step
yet
taken
towards
our
ultimate
goal
of
finding
life
on
other
planets
of
proving
that
we
are
not
alone
thanks
to
our
observations
and
our
climate
model
of
this
planet
we
have
shown
that
its
water
vapor
can
condense
into
liquid
water
this
is
a
first
