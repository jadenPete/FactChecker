editor's
note
this
is
a
bipartisan
takeover
of
the
internet
to
kill
dissident
speech
as
we
outlined
last
year
when
top
neocons
said
facebook
censorship
of
conservatives
was
just
the
beginning
during
a
conference
in
germany
the
pentagon
has
declared
war
on
memes
as
darpa
launches
a
new
program
to
fight
polarizing
viral
content
before
it
spreads
the
defense
advanced
research
projects
agency
is
seeking
to
create
software
with
the
capability
to
automatically
detect
attribute
and
characterize
falsified
multi-modal
media
to
defend
against
large-scale
automated
disinformation
attacks
the
software
will
scan
news
stories
photos
and
videos
to
identify
polarizing
viral
content
and
stop
its
spread
to
eliminate
malicious
intent
entirely
alex
jones
is
sending
an
emergency
message
to
president
trump
about
the
methods
being
used
to
eliminate
free
speech
on
the
internet
and
seize
control
of
future
elections
titled
semantic
forensics
the
program
will
run
content
through
a
myriad
of
algorithms
to
identify
inconsistencies
and
identify
a
story
or
a
meme
as
inauthentic
or
fake
the
system
will
also
pinpoint
the
origin
of
the
meme
the
intent
behind
it
and
predict
the
impact
of
its
spread
given
that
the
program
doesn't
take
into
account
the
fact
that
so-called
trusted
sources
in
the
mainstream
media
have
been
responsible
for
some
of
the
biggest
fake
news
stories
in
modern
history
such
as
trump-russia
election
collusion
the
software
will
only
succeed
in
eliminating
dissident
narratives
as
helen
buyniski
warns
the
true
intent
of
the
program
seems
to
be
to
stamp
out
dissent
to
hear
them
tell
it
the
pentagon
just
wants
to
even
the
playing
field
between
the
good
guys
the
fake-hunters
pursuing
the
cause
of
truth
in
media
and
the
bad
guys
sowing
discord

that

in

largely
originated
in
