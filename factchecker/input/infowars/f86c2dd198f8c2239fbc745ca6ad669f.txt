prevention
a
recent
study
led
by
researchers
from
the
national
university
of
singapore
nus
revealed
that
regular
tea
drinkers
have
better
organized
brain
regions
and
this
is
associated
with
healthy
cognitive
function
compared
to
non-tea
drinkers
the
research
team
made
this
discovery
after
examining
neuroimaging
data
of
older
adults
our
results
offer
the
first
evidence
of
positive
contribution
of
tea
drinking
to
brain
structure
and
suggest
that
drinking
tea
regularly
has
a
protective
effect
against
age-related
decline
in
brain
organization

who
is
from
the
department
of
psychological
medicine
at
the

school
of

the
research
was
carried
out
together
with
collaborators
from
the
university
of
essex
and
university
of
cambridge
and
the
findings
were
published

benefits
of
regular
intake
of
tea
past
studies
have
demonstrated
that
tea
intake
is
beneficial
to
human
health
and
the
positive
effects
include
mood
improvement
and
cardiovascular
disease
prevention
in
fact
results
of
a
longitudinal
study
led
by
asst
prof
feng
which
was
published
in
showed
that
daily
consumption
of
tea
can
reduce
the
risk
of
cognitive
decline
in
older
persons
by
percent
following
this
discovery
asst
prof
feng
and
his
team
further
explored
the
direct
effect
of
tea
on
brain
networks
the
research
team
recruited
adults
aged
and
above
and
gathered
data
about
their
health
lifestyle
and
psychological
well-being
the
elderly
participants
also
had
to
undergo
neuropsychological
tests
and
magnetic
resonance
imaging
mri
the
study
was
carried
out
from
to
upon
analyzing
the
participants
cognitive
performance
and
imaging
results
the
research
team
found
that
individuals
who
consumed
either
green
tea
oolong
tea
or
black
tea
at
least
four
times
a
week
for
about
years
had
brain
regions
that
were
interconnected
in
a
more
efficient
way
take
the
analogy
of
road
traffic
as
an
example
consider
brain
regions
as
destinations
while
the
connections
between
brain
regions
are
roads
when
a
road
system
is
better
organized
the
movement
of
vehicles
and
passengers
is
more
efficient
and
uses
less
resources
similarly
when
the
connections
between
brain
regions
are
more
structured
information
processing
can
be
performed
more
efficiently
explained
asst
prof
feng
he
added
we
have
shown
in
our
previous
studies
that
tea
drinkers
had
better
cognitive
function
as
compared
to
non-tea
drinkers
our
current
results
relating
to
brain
network
indirectly
support
our
previous
findings
by
showing
that
the
positive
effects
of
regular
tea
drinking
are
the
result
of
improved
brain
organization
brought
about
by
preventing
disruption
to
interregional
connections
next
step
in
research
as
cognitive
performance
and
brain
organization
are
intricately
related
more
research
is
needed
to
better
understand
how
functions
like
memory
emerge
from
brain
circuits
and
the
possible
interventions
to
better
preserve
cognition
during
the
aging
process
asst
prof
feng
and
his
team
plan
to
examine
the
effects
of
tea
as
well
as
the
bioactive
compounds
in
tea
can
have
on
cognitive
decline
now
that
bayer
has
merged
with
monsanto
they're
releasing
a
new
version
of
the
infamous
product
round-up
called
barricor
alex
points
out
how
this
is
a
tactic
used
in
the
past
to
relaunch
something
horrible
