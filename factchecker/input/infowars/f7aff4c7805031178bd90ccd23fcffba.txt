house
of
commons
descends
into
chaos
the
british
house
of
commons
descended
into
chaos
on
tuesday
as
mps
tried
to
one-up
each
other
with
ostentatious
displays
of
outrage
over
boris
johnson's
suspension
of
parliament
mps
scuffled
at
the
doorway
and
had
to
be
escorted
out
by
security
one
mp
even
vaulted
themselves
at
the
chair
of
outgoing
house
speaker
john
bercow
meanwhile
the
less
melodramatic
among
them
merely
held
up
signs
reading
silenced
in
protest
at
the
five-week
closure
announced
by
uk
prime
minister
bercow
also
railed
against
the
proroguing
or
suspension
of
parliament
labour's
lloyd
russell-moyle
threw
himself
at
bercow's
chair
when
bercow
later
left
the
chamber
and
made
his
way
to
the
house
of
lords
he
left
his
own
silenced
sign
in
his
vacant
seat
opposition
mps
even
engaged
in
a
protest
singalong
refusing
to
leave
the
chamber
in
opposition
to
what
they
perceive
as
a
bastardization
of
british
democracy
the
bizarre
scenes
unfolded
at
roughly
am
british
time
after
a
marathon
day
in
which
mps
successfully
blocked
johnson's
second
bid
for
a
snap
general
election
i
will
play
my
part
but
this
is
not
a
normal
prorogation
it
is
not
typical
it
is
not
standard
it
is
one
of
the
longest
for
decades
and
it
represents
not
just
in
the
minds
of
many
colleagues
but
huge
numbers
of
people
outside
an
act
of
executive
fiat
but
i
will
play
my
part
bercow
told
the
new
black
rod
sarah
clarke
essentially
a
messenger
from
the
house
of
lords
who
entered
the
chamber
to
summon
bercow
and
the
mps
through
the
lobby
to
the
upper
house
globalism
was
conceived
to
sabotage
the
renaissance
and
plunge
humanity
into
a
new
dark
age
