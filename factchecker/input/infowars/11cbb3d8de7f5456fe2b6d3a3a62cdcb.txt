pewdiepie
rescinds
donation
to
adl
after
major
backlash
popular
gamer
says
he
hadn't
done
research
on
organization
which
tried
to
get
him
banned
off
youtube
famed
youtuber
pewdiepie
announced
he
will
not
be
making
a
donation
to
the
anti-defamation
league
after
his
proposal
to
do
so
sparked
major
backlash
in
a
video
thursday
felix
kjellberg
said
he
probably
should
have
gone
with
a
charity
he'd
done
research
on
rather
than
selecting
one
advised
to
him
when
we
were
planning
the
collaboration
we
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
donate
to
a
charity
as
a
way
to
celebrate
kjellberg
says
i
made
the
mistake
of
picking
a
charity
i
was
advised
instead
of
picking
a
charity
that
i'm
personally
passionate
about
which
is
my
fault
pewds
says
viewers
were
keen
to
notice
he
didn't
seem
too
enthusiastic
about
his
donation
choice
which
some
labeled
blackmail
as
the
adl
has
been
one
of
the
leading
groups
advocating
for
his
censorship
so
when
i
uploaded
the
video
talking
about
the
charity
it
was
very
brief
and
people
could
tell
something
was
off
the
whole
internet
just
didn't
believe
it
and
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
that
unfold
laughs
kjellberg
confesses
he
thought
the
donation
could
help
offset
some
of
the
negative
criticism
from
media
outlets
calling
him
alt-right
to
be
fair
i
saw
it
as
an
opportunity
to
put
an
end
to
these
alt-right
claims
that
have
been
thrown
against
me
it
wasn't
to
clear
my
name
or
save
grace
if
it
was
i
would've
done
it
years
ago
but
after
the
christchurch
tragedy
i
felt
a
responsibility
to
do
something
about
it
because
it's
no
longer
just
about
me
it
affected
other
people
in
a
way
and
i'm
not
okay
with
that
i've
struggled
to
figure
out
how
to
do
that
but
this
is
not
the
right
way
to
go
about
it
moments
before
the
new
zealand
christchurch
attack
on
two
mosques
which
left
dead
the
gunman
who
uploaded
video
of
the
shooting
to
social
media
said
the
words
subscribe
to
pewdiepie
which
was
a
major
campaign
by
the
youtube
gamer
aiming
to
be
the
most
subscribed
channel
on
the
platform
pewdiepie
says
after
doing
his
research
the
adl
was
probably
not
the
right
charity
to
go
with
i
knew
it
wasn't
perfect
but
i
also
didn't
know
a
lot
of
things
that
surfaced
throughout
this
thing
about
the
charity
that
doesn't
fit
at
all
so
i
understand
why
people
had
concerns
about
it
and
these
are
things
i
would've
known
myself
if
i
had
only
taken
my
time
it
really
doesn't
feel
genuine
for
me
to
proceed
with
the
donation
at
this
point
and
i
instead
i
actually
do
want
to
take
my
time
keep
the
intent
that
i
had
but
just
doing
it
with
the
right
charity
and
doing
it
properly
i'm
sorry
for
all
the
confusion
and
i'm
sorry
for
messing
this
up
that's
what
i
do
laughs
smiles
gives
two
thumbs
up
kjellberg's
move
to
take
back
his
donation
followed
a
now-deleted
statement
he
released
yesterday
in
which
he
doubled
down
on
his
decision
fans
were
stunned
at
the
youtuber's
announcement
of
an
adl
donation
earlier
this
week
after
the
organization's
ceo
personally
lobbied
for
disney
to
stop
sponsoring
his
content
calling
him
a
nazi
sympathizer
and
anti-semitic
in
the
meantime
the
adl
says
they
haven't
seen
a
cent
