government
demands
apple
google
release
names
of
gun
scope
app
users
never
before
has
a
case
been
disclosed
in
which
american
investigators
demanded
personal
data
of
users
of
single
app
the
u.s.
government
wants
tech
giants
apple
and
google
to
hand
over
the
names
phone
numbers
and
other
data
of
over
users
of
a
gun
scope
app
according
to
reports
according
to
a
doj
court
order
application
investigators
want
the
information
of
users
of
obsidian
an
app
that
helps
to
calibrate
rifle
scopes
as
part
of
a
probe
into
possible
breaches
of
weapons
export
regulations
from
forbes
the
app
allows
gun
owners
to
get
a
live
stream
take
video
and
calibrate
their
gun
scope
from
an
android
or
iphone
device
according
to
the
google
play
page
for
obsidian
it
has
more
than
downloads
apple
doesn't
provide
download
numbers
so
it's
unclear
how
many
iphone
owners
could
be
swept
up
in
this
latest
government
data
grab
it's
an
unprecedented
move
never
before
has
a
case
been
disclosed
in
which
american
investigators
demanded
personal
data
of
users
of
a
single
app
from
apple
and
google
and
never
has
an
order
been
made
public
where
the
feds
have
asked
the
silicon
valley
giants
for
info
on
so
many
thousands
of
people
in
one
go
alex
jones
covers
the
spy
grid
dragnet
system
already
in
place
that's
being
used
against
the
public
the
government
argues
that
the
data
acquisition
of
innocent
people
using
the
app
will
help
in
identifying
networks
engaged
in
unlawful
export
of
certain
rifle
scopes
this
pattern
of
unlawful
attempted
exports
of
this
rifle
scope
in
combination
with
the
manner
in
which
the
atn
obsidian
application
is
paired
with
this
scope
manufactured
by
company
a
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
information
requested
herein
will
assist
the
government
in
identifying
networks
engaged
in
the
unlawful
export
of
this
rifle
scope
through
identifying
end
users
located
in
countries
to
which
export
of
this
item
is
restricted
the
government
order
reportedly
reads
privacy
lawyer
tor
ekeland
says
the
move
will
violate
the
rights
of
thousands
of
american
citizens
not
connected
with
the
unlawful
scope
smuggling
the
danger
is
the
government
will
go
on
this
fishing
expedition
and
they'll
see
information
unrelated
to
what
they
weren't
looking
for
and
go
after
someone
for
something
else
ekeland
said
there's
a
more
profound
issue
here
with
the
government
able
to
vacuum
up
a
vast
amount
of
data
on
people
they
have
no
reason
to
suspect
have
committed
any
crime
they
don't
have
any
probable
cause
to
investigate
but
they're
getting
access
to
data
on
them
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
big
tech
will
comply
with
the
unprecedented
order
but
given
their
willingness
to
restrict
the
american
people's
second
amendment
rights
it
won't
be
surprising
if
they
