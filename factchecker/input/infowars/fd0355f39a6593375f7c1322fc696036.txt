british
globalists
pass
bill
to
block
no-deal
brexit
ongoing
elitist
efforts
to
ignore
british
referendum
the
open
elitist
worldview
is
really
quite
remarkable
the
jaw-dropping
elitism
expressed
by
british
members
of
parliament
continued
today
as
globalists
in
the
conservative
party
joined
with
globalists
in
the
labour
party
and
passed
a
bill
in
the
uk
house
of
commons
to
block
no-deal
brexit
their
goal
is
to
handcuff
prime
minister
boris
johnson
from
leaving
the
eu
on
october
st
backstory
here
the
multinational
banks
and
financial
elite
have
poured
money
toward
the
anti-brexit
politicians
both
parties
and
deployed
all
media
efforts
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
u.
k
from
leaving
the
european
union
despite
the
majority
of
british
who
voted
to
leave
in
the
latest
move
by
the
elitist
group
led
by
far-left
jeremy
corbyn
forces
the
u.k.
to
say
in
the
eu
until
an
agreement
to
exit
the
eu
is
affirmed
however
the
actual
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
empower
the
eu
never
to
agree
to
any
terms
of
brexit
thereby
keeping
the
u.k.
in
the
eu
forever
boris
johnson
has
requested
a
mid-october
general
election
so
the
british
people
can
remove
the
elitist
politicians
however
two-thirds
of
those
same
politicians
would
have
to
agree
to
allow
a
vote
that
would
eliminate
their
position
therefore
the
pontificating
elite
are
also
blocking
any
effort
at
a
snap
election
it's
a
mess
right
now
the
upper
chamber
house
of
lords
has
threatened
to
filibuster
the
lower
chamber
house
of
commons
bill
in
an
effort
to
help
their
prime
minister
however
there
is
also
a
possibility
prime
minister
johnson
could
intentionally
just
ignore
the
law
if
passed
proceed
toward
a
no-deal
brexit
and
force
parliament
to
vote
him
out
of
office
which
would
trigger
the
general
election
vote
the
prime
minister
is
seeking
all
smart
devices
to
report
back
to
darpa
harpa
private
conversations
leading
to
red
flag
gun
confiscations
alex
jones
breaks
down
this
terrifying
ai
surveillance
proposal
by
big
tech
which
the
white
house
is
considering
that
surpasses
the
nightmares
of
george
orwell
it's
a
classic
case
of
elitist
politicians
trying
all
parliamentary
rules
to
override
the
majority
vote
of
the
people
in
the
country
two
centuries
ago
the
masses
would
have
already
taken
arms
against
their
overseers
stormed
the
gates
and
hung
the
politicians
from
tower
bridge
unfortunately
in
it's
less
likely
to
happen
although
if
the
elitist
politicians
keep
this
up
well
you
never
know
via
ap
in
a
second
straight
day
of
parliamentary
turmoil
the
house
of
commons
voted
by
in
favor
of
an
opposition
bill
to
block
a
no-deal
brexit
sending
it
to
parliament's
upper
chamber
the
house
of
lords
even
so
the
bill's
fate
is
unsure
with
johnson
set
to
suspend
parliament
for
several
weeks
starting
next
week
pro-brexit
peers
in
the
lords
are
threatening
to
try
to
stop
it
by
filibustering
until
time
runs
out
there
is
very
little
time
left
said
labour
party
lawmaker
hilary
benn
as
he
introduced
the
opposition
bill
the
purpose
of
the
bill
is
very
simple
to
ensure
that
the
united
kingdom
does
not
leave
the
european
union
on
the
st
of
october
without
an
agreement
the
bill
would
require
the
government
to
ask
the
eu
to
delay
brexit
until
jan
if
it
can't
secure
a
deal
with
the
bloc
by
late
october
the
lawmakers
hope
to
pass
the
bill
into
law
a
process
that
can
take
months
by
the
end
of
the
week
because
johnson
plans
to
suspend
parliament
at
some
point
next
week
until
oct
johnson
became
prime
minister
in
july
by
promising
to
lead
britain
out
of
the
eu
breaking
the
impasse
that
has
paralyzed
the
country's
politics
since
voters
decided
in
june
to
leave
the
bloc
but
he
is
caught
between
the
eu
which
refuses
to
renegotiate
the
deal
it
stuck
with
may
and
a
majority
of
british
lawmakers
opposed
to
leaving
without
an
agreement
most
economists
say
a
no-deal
brexit
would
cause
severe
economic
disruption
and
plunge
the
u.k.
into
recession
read
more
perhaps
nothing
personifies
the
elitist
outlook
more
than
this
letter
from
phillip
lee
a
member
of
boris
johnson's
own
party
who
is
resigning
because
the
prime
minister
continues
to
listen
to
the
unwashed
people
disregard
the
elites
and
pursue
brexit
read
this
source
the
twin
diseases
of
populism
and
english
nationalism
dr
lee
is
apoplectic
that
any
politician
might
listen
to
the
british
people
mp
phillip
lee
openly
states
any
british
person
who
wants
to
leave
the
eu
is
suffering
from
a
disease
of
wrongful
thought
and
accuses
them
of
british
patriotism
how
dare
they
be
so
bold
the
open
elitist
worldview
is
really
quite
remarkable
blocking
no
deal
brexit
means
we
either
accept
any
deal
the
rest
of
eu
deems
appropriate
which
of
course
will
be
entirely
to
their
advantage
or
we
don't
leave
the
eu
at
all
either
way
we're
screwed
and
u.k.
democracy
is
dead
and
buried
we
need
to
kick
out
the
traitors
