featured
on
the
r
portland
reddit
thread
claimed
that
police
said
it
was
legal
for
the
homeless
to
defecate
in
public
after
shocked
onlookers
saw
a
man
with
his
butt
in
the
air
depositing
a
turd
onto
the
sidewalk
yes
really
titled
is
it
really
legal

a
dump
on
the
sidewalk
the
reddit
user
explains
in
the
post
how
he
was
on
his
way
to
lunch
when
he
noticed
a
group
of
people
pointing
and
staring
in
the
same
direction
there
was
a
homeless
person
bent
at
the
waist
pants
down
ass
in
the
air
depositing
a
turd
onto
the
sidewalk
he
writes
one
onlooker
went
across
the
street
to
tell
police
officers
and
she
came
back
and
said
the
cops
say
it's
legal
after
my
lunch
the
turd
was
still
there
with
shoe
prints
in
it
tracking
it
down
the
sidewalk

expressed
amazement
that

and
under
good
to
go
joked
one
respondent
like

other
progressive
utopias
portland
has
increasing
problems
with
homeless
people
acting
aggressive
and
turning
entire
neighborhoods
into
waste
dumps
as
we
highlighted
yesterday
a
leftist
council
member
recently
tried
to
stop
feces
being
cleaned
off
the
streets
of
seattle
with
a
power
washer
arguing
that
it
was
racist
because
it
reminded
him
of
hoses
being
used
to
disperse
civil
rights
protesters
as
we
document
in
the
video
below
portland's
problems
aren't
just
restricted
to
public
pooping
the
whole
city
is
basically
a
shithole
for
all
manner
of
different
progressive
