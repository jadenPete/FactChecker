russia
offered
to
sell
trump
hypersonic
weapons
putin
it
remains
unclear
if
the
us
president
has
considered
the
offer
moscow
offered
washington
the
chance
to
purchase
russian
hypersonic
weapons
instead
of
developing
its
own
vladimir
putin
has
revealed
the
us
however
is
seeking
to
create
analogues
the
bombshell
revelation
was
made
by
russia's
president
on
thursday
as
he
was
speaking
at
the
eastern
economic
forum
eef
in
vladivostok
i've
told
donald
trump
do
you
want
us
to
sell
it
hypersonic
weaponry
to
you
and
we
would
balance
everything
by
that
putin
said
when
asked
how
new
russian
weaponry
might
fit
into
existing
arms-control
agreements
it
remains
unclear
if
the
us
president
has
considered
the
offer
as
washington
is
seeking
to
create
hypersonic
weapons
of
its
own
well
maybe
they
will
but
why
spend
money
when
we've
already
spent
it
and
could
have
got
something
in
return
without
hurting
our
own
security
and
for
the
sake
of
creating
balance
putin
added
it
was
not
immediately
clear
if
russia's
president
was
serious
about
his
offer
or
if
it
was
an
example
of
very
high-profile
trolling
since
moscow
just
as
anybody
else
has
always
been
quite
reluctant
to
sell
the
newest
weapons
abroad
or
at
least
created
special
export
versions
of
them
the
hypersonic
missiles
can
achieve
very
high
speeds
which
make
them
more
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
intercept
with
existing
systems
designed
to
counter
their
slower
counterparts
a
whole
bunch
of
new
weapons
including
hypersonic
missiles
lasers
cruise
missiles
and
underwater
drones
with
nuclear
power
engines
were
unveiled
by
russia's
president
in
march
some
of
the
weapons
such
as
an
air-launched
hypersonic
kinzhal
missile
have
already
been
shown
in
action
to
the
general
public
other
systems
namely
the
peresvet
combat
laser
complex
are
veiled
in
mystery
and
their
exact
purpose
and
capabilities
remain
unknown
putin's
announcement
made
quite
a
fuss
back
then
with
the
us
going
all
the
way
from
denying
the
existence
of
such
weaponry
to
scrambling
to
create
ones
of
their
own
naturally
the
hypersonic
weapons
rush
yielded
very
lucrative
contracts
for
the
american
military-industrial
complex
yet
nothing
else
has
been
produced
so
far
alex
jones
is
holding
president
trump
accountable
for
his
role
in
the
federal
government's
spy
grid
and
control
infrastructure
