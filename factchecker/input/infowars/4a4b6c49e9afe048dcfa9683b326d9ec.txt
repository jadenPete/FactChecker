dem
candidate
announces
support
for
global
eugenics
depopulation
in
a
bizarre
almost
surreal
cnn
town
hall
event
that
repeatedly
claimed
hurricanes
are
all
man-made
democrat
presidential
candidate
bernie
sanders
called
for
a
global-scale
eugenics
program
to
reduce
the
human
population
by
accelerating
abortions
in
countries
populated
by
people
of
color
advocacy
for
all
this
came
from
sanders
response
to
a
pre-screened
question
from
an
audience
member
named
martha
readyoff
a
teacher
from
new
milford
connecticut
her
question
is
heavily
peppered
with
presuppositions
such
as
claiming
abortion
is
empowering
women
the
question
was
obviously
intended
to
push
sanders
toward
a
more
radical
left-wing
position
and
he
took
the
bait
here's
her
question
h
t
to
newsbusters
org
for
the
transcripts
good
evening
human
population
growth
has
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
years
the
planet
cannot
sustain
this
growth
i
realize
this
is
a
poisonous
topic
for
politicians
but
it's
crucial
to
face
empowering
women
and
educating
everyone
on
the
need
to
curb
population
growth
seems
a
reasonable
campaign
to
enact
would
you
be
courageous
enough
to
discuss
this
issue
and
make
it
a
key
feature
in
a
plan
to
address
climate
catastrophe
bernie
sanders
reply
well
martha
the
answer
is
yes
and
the
answer
has
everything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
women
in
the
united
states
of
americas
by
the
way
have
a
right
to
control
their
own
bodies
and
make
reproductive
decisions
and
the
mexico
city
agreement
which
denies
american
aid
to
those
organizations
around
the
world
that
allow
women
to
have
abortions
or
even
get
involved
in
birth
control
to
me
is
totally
absurd
so
i
think
especially
in
poor
countries
around
the
world
where
women
do
not
necessarily
want
to
have
large
numbers
of
babies
and
where
they
can
have
the
opportunity
through
birth
control
to
control
the
number
of
kids
they
have
something
i
very
strongly
support
decoding
the
sanders
depopulation
agendawhat
bernie
sanders
is
really
saying
here
is
that
america
should
export
more
abortion
funding
and
services
to
third
world
countries
that
are
largely
populated
by
people
of
color
secondly
sanders
did
not
in
any
way
push
back
against
the
population
control
portion
of
the
question
the
question
was
strongly
twisted
to
imply
that
pushing
depopulation
requires
courage
and
sanders
affirmed
that
he's
all
in
for
reducing
human
population
as
a
means
to
address
the
climate
catastrophe
this
is
what
the
deranged
anti-human
left
has
come
to
exporting
the
murder
of
human
babies
in
the
name
of
saving
the
planet
from
climate
change
a
completely
fabricated
quack
science
fiction
that's
been
aggressively
pushed
by
the
fake
news
media
like
cnn
and
the
nyt
in
pushing
for
global
depopulation
goals
bernie
sanders
mirrors
the
efforts
of
former
president
richard
nixon's
science
advisor
dr
lee
dubridge
in
he
advocated
lacing
u.s.
food
exports
with
infertility
chemicals
to
cause
miscarriages
infertility
and
spontaneous
abortions
in
third
world
nations
this
eugenics
program
was
documented
by
the
new
york
times
in
a
nov
article
by
gladwin
hill
entitled
a
sterility
drug
in
food
is
hinted
biologist
stresses
need
to
curb
population
growth
that
article
quotes
dr
lee
dubridge
the
science
advisor
to
president
nixon
as
saying
population
control
should
be
the
prime
task
of
every
government
as
reported
by
natural
news
the
new
york
times
article
quotes
dr
paul
ehrlich
of
stanford
university
a
depopulation
advocate
as
well
as
president
richard
nixon's
chief
science
adviser
dr
lee
dubridge
who
said
that
population
control
should
be
the
prime
task
of
every
government
in
the
article
dr
ehrlich
laments
the
fact
that
biologists
believe
compulsory
family
regulation
will
be
necessary
to
retard
population
growth
in
essence
he
is
arguing
that
the
government
should
be
in
charge
of
reproductive
rights
determining
who
is
allowed
to
reproduce
and
who
must
be
sterilized
to
achieve
the
sterilization
goals
he
urged
establishing
a
federal
population
commission
with
a
large
budget
for
propaganda
reports
the
new
york
times
he
also
called
for
the
addition
of
a
temporary
sterilant
to
staple
food
or
to
the
water
supply
in
order
to
cause
mandatory
infertility
last
night
on
cnn
bernie
sanders
just
echoed
the
depopulation
agenda
of
president
richard
nixon's
science
advisor
who
openly
called
for
the
covert
sterilization
of
impoverished
people
of
color
who
live
in
low-income
countries
bernie
sanders
in
other
words
is
a
eugenicist
and
his
eugenics
scheme
specifically
targets
people
of
color
for
expanded
abortions
i
e
infanticide
and
depopulation
notably
this
is
also
cnn's
position
since
cnn
screened
all
the
questions
and
fed
the
presuppositions
to
the
candidates
during
its
hour
broadcast
that
spread
wildly
false
information
about
climate
science
hurricanes
and
human
population
