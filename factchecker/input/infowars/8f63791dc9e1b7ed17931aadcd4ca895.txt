burger
king
in
south
africa
is
dropping
the
word
ham
from
hamburger
to
avoid
offending
muslims
yes
really
the
double
spicy
hamburger
will
now
become
just
a
double
spicy
burger
while
the
triple
hamburger
with
cheese
becomes
the
triple
burger
with
cheese
and
a
hamburger

will

the
company
whose
headquarters
are
based
in
miami
florida
said
the
word
was
being
eliminated
in
order
to
be
more
respectful
of
muslim
customers
the
change
is
being
made
despite
the
fact
that
the
ham
in
hamburger
has
nothing
to
do
with
pork
and
relates
to
the
german
city
of
hamburg
where
the
patties
were
first
made
however
the
company
admitted
that
its
outlets
in
south
africa
would
be
losing
their
halal
certification
because
of
popular
demand
for
some
sandwiches
to
include
bacon
this
all
appears
to
be
a
very
awkward
or
you
could
say
ham-fisted
attempt
to
be
politically
correct
