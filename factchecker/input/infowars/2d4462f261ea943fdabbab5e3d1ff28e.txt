turkey
is
threatening
to
open
the
gates
to
europe
potentially
unleashing
a
torrent
of
migrants
who
have
been
kept
inside
its
borders
in
exchange
for
massive
payoffs
president
tayyip
erdogan
has
called
upon
western
nations
to
fund
the
repatriation
of
one
million
syrian
refugees
he
plans
resettle
in
a
safe
zone
in
their
home
country
reuters
reports
our
goal
is
for
at
least
one
million
of
our
syrian
brothers
to
return
to
the
safe
zone
we
will
form
along
our
km
border
erdogan
said
during
a
speech
in
ankara
on
thursday
give
us
logistical
support
and
we
can
go
build
housing
at
km
miles
depth
in
northern
syria
this
way
we
can
provide
them
with
humanitarian
living
conditions
this
either
happens
or
otherwise
we
will
have
to
open
the
gates
erdogan
warned
either
you
will
provide
support
or
excuse
us
but
we
are
not
going
to
carry
this
weight
alone
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
help
from
the
international
community
namely
the
european
union
turkey
is
reportedly
holding
roughly
million
refugees
many
of
whom
arrived
since
the
migrant
crisis
ankara
has
received
billions
of
euros
in
aid
from
the
eu
in
exchange
for
preventing
many
migrants
from
continuing
on
to
europe
however
cracks
in
the
arrangement
seem
to
be
growing
wider
in
recent
months
as
thousands
of
migrants
have
been
pouring
into
greece
again
including
over
who
landed
on
the
island
of
lesbos
during
a
single
day
last
week
greece's
foreign
minister
recently
summoned
the
turkish
ambassador
to
express
greece's
deep
discontent
about
the
growing
waves
of
migrants
coming
from
turkey
a
huge
chinese
cargo
ship
has
unloaded
troops
and
vehicles
into
hong
kong
amidst
rumors
of
a
military
crackdown
on
protesters
