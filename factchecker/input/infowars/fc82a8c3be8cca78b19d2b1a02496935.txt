cnn
analyst
max
boot
penned
an
op-ed
monday
lamenting
over
the
fact
his
many
hit
pieces
and
sound
bites
against
trump
have
failed
to
usurp
the
duly-elected
president
in
his
op-ed
for
the
washington
post
boot
describes
an
existential
crisis
he
faced
upon
realizing
that
no
matter
how
hard
he's
tried
in
the
last
three
years
to
overthrow
trump
nothing
has
worked
don't
get
me
wrong
i
love
what
i
do
and
realize
i
am
supremely
lucky
to
be
able
to
make
my
living
by
writing
and
speaking
about
the
news
of
the
day
i
find
contentment
in
the
craft
of
writing
and
fulfillment
in
self-expression
but
i
do
sometimes
wonder
what
i
am
actually
accomplishing
boot
wrote
much
of
my
journalism
for
the
past
four
years
has
been
devoted
to
critiquing
president
trump
and
opposing
the
spread
of
trumpism
but
no
matter
how
many
columns
or
sound
bites
i
produce
he
remains
in
office
acting
as
sharpiegate
shows
more
erratically
than
ever
sure
he's
not
terribly
popular
but
he
could
still
be
reelected
i
am
left
to
ask
if
all
my
work
has
made
any
difference
users
on
social
media
quickly
mocked
cnn's
top
neocon
for
even
believing
that
his
fake
news
articles
could
somehow
force
trump
out
of
office
boot
wrapped
up
his
poor
me
article
by
questioning
whether
he
can
change
the
world
admitting
he's
had
to
find
satisfaction
just
completing
household
chores
because
at
least
he
can
see
results
i
don't
know
if
i
can
ever
change
the
world
but
at
least
i
can
change
the
oil
in
my
car
my
next
chore
boot
wrote
and
maybe
just
maybe
i
am
starting
to
realize
as
i
turn
that's
good
enough
