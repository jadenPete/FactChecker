ban
backfires
small
businesses
seeing
uptick
in
clientele
following
the
move
walmart's
decision
to
discontinue
all
sales
of
handguns
popular
ammunition
as
well
as
ending
their
open
carry
policy
has
sparked
controversy
millie
weaver
asked
walmart
shoppers
and
firearm
dealers
if
they
think
this
was
a
smart
move
by
the
company
or
will
it
only
bring
more
business
back
to
smaller
businesses
not
surprising
many
walmart
shoppers
are
gun
owners
and
are
disappointed
with
the
decision
while
on
the
other
hand
small
firearm
dealers
say
their
sales
have
gone
up
will
walmart's
political
move
prove
to
be
an
effective
solution
to
gun
violence
or
will
it
make
its
customers
more
vulnerable
to
future
attacks
