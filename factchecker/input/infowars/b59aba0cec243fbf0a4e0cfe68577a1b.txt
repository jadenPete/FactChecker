why
infowars
still
isn't
welcome
on
youtube
big
tech
trying
to
appear
neutral
despite
recent
purge
of
conservatives
libertarians
iw
editor's
note
this
is
a
pr
stunt
by
big
tech
to
tell
congress
oh
we
don't
censor
anybody
by
allowing
previously
banned
people
back
on
their
platforms
who
are
then
usually
banned
again
without
public
attention
or
are
just
simply
shadow
banned
so
they
can't
reach
as
many
people
much
like
a
car
stuck
in
neutral
that's
revving
up
but
not
going
anywhere
if
trump
is
tired
of
being
president
and
wants
to
hand
over
the
white
house
to
someone
else
in
then
he
should
just
ignore
this
issue
which
at
its
very
core
is
a
first
amendment
issue
that
will
lead
to
the
erosion
of
every
other
personal
freedom
listed
in
the
bill
of
rights
the
only
way
to
promote
civil
discourse
in
america
is
to
promote
open
discussions
between
people
with
differing
political
views
a
true
marketplace
of
ideas
youtube
head
susan
wojcicki
announced
earlier
this
week
that
the
video-sharing
site
would
allow
some
content
that
was
outside
the
mainstream
controversial
or
even
offensive
so
alex
jones
infowars
took
that
as
a
positive
sign
infowars
afternoon
show
the
war
room
relaunched
its
youtube
channel
with
a
video
titled
breaking
youtube
ceo
says
alex
jones
and
infowars
ban
is
over
war
room
host
j.
owen
shroyer
uploaded
videos
before
youtube
pulled
them
in
a
video
posted
on
the
infowars
site
he
angrily
denounced
both
google
and
wojcicki
shroyer
also
confronted
google
employees
on
camera
at
the
company's
offices
in
austin
texas
about
its
decision
everyone
sees
the
double-standard
at
youtube
shroyer
said
echoing
complaints
of
political
conservatives
who
claim
tech
platforms
censor
their
views
according
to
the
washington
post
war
room
violated
youtube's
terms
of
service
by
circumventing
the
infowars
ban
by
the
site
for
violating
its
policies
against
hate
speech
as
i
noted
before
alex
jones
relies
on
associates
to
spread
his
message
on
social
media
where
he
is
unable
to
operate
i
reached
out
to
shroyer
on
social
media
and
through
the
infowars
site
and
haven't
heard
back
there
was
no
indication
in
wojcicki's
statement
that
infowars
was
being
welcomed
back
in
fact
the
alphabet-owned
website
announced
in
june
that
it
would
crack
down
on
videos
that
promote
white
supremacy
nazism
and
sexism
and
other
forms
of
discrimination
along
with
content
that
denies
well-documented
violent
events
like
the
holocaust
and
the
massacre
at
sandy
hook
elementary
school
jones
and
infowars
are
being
sued
by
parents
of
sandy
hook
victims
for
spreading
the
unfounded
rumor
that
the
mass
shooting
was
a
hoax
a
view
his
fans
note
he
longer
holds
though
jones
and
his
associates
paint
themselves
as
crusaders
for
free
speech
the
first
amendment
doesn't
guarantee
anyone
the
right
to
harass
the
parents
of
murdered
children
jones
spreads
other
baseless
conspiracy
theories
as
well
including
the
one
claiming
that
the
terrorist
attacks
was
an
inside
job
youtube
and
other
social
media
platforms
are
under
increasing
pressure
to
do
a
better
job
policing
themselves
when
it
comes
to
hate
speech
and
have
fallen
short
in
the
eyes
of
many
gizmodo
recently
reported
it
was
disturbingly
easy
to
find
channels
associated
with
hate
groups
on
the
platform
an
analysis
released
by
the
anti-defamation
league's
center
on
extremism
earlier
this
month
came
to
the
same
conclusion
youtube
has
countered
that
it
is
doing
its
best
to
scrub
objectionable
content
from
its
site
however
it's
a
daunting
task
since
about
hours
of
content
are
uploaded
to
youtube
every
minute
still
this
is
a
technology
challenge
that
the
high-tech
industry
must
tackle
youtube
ceo
susan
wojcicki
said
tuesday
that
it's
more
important
than
ever
for
youtube
to
remain
an
open
platform
just
one
day
after
going
on
a
massive
banning
spree
targeting
right-wingers
for
so-called
hate
speech
