stemexpress
ceo
admits
selling
beating
baby
hearts
intact
baby
heads
in
daleiden
hearing
it
begs
the
question
how
did
they
get
these
fully
intact
human
children
asks
lawyer
san
francisco
september
lifesitenews
the
ceo
of
stemexpress
admitted
in
court
thursday
that
her
biotech
company
supplies
beating
fetal
hearts
and
intact
fetal
heads
to
medical
researchers
she
also
admitted
at
the
preliminary
hearing
of
david
daleiden
and
sandra
merritt
of
the
center
for
medical
progress
that
the
baby's
head
could
be
procured
attached
to
the
baby's
body
or
could
be
torn
away
that
is
an
especially
gruesome
admission
but
it
begs
the
question
how
did
they
get
these
fully
intact
human
children
says
peter
breen
of
the
thomas
more
society
which
is
representing
daleiden
at
the
hearing
if
you
have
a
fetus
with
an
intact
head
and
an
intact
body
and
intact
extremities
that
is
something
that
would
indicate
that
child
was
born
alive
and
then
had
their
organs
cut
out
of
them
or
that
that
child
was
the
victim
of
an
illegal
partial-birth
abortion
he
told
lifesitenews
both
of
these
are
gruesome
and
violent
acts
cmp's
daleiden
and
merritt
are
charged
with
felony
counts
of
illegal
taping
of
confidential
information
in
connection
with
undercover
videos
they
released
in
after
a
three-year
covert
investigation
into
the
buying
and
selling
of
baby
body
parts
which
is
a
felony
the
covertly
recorded
videos
exposed
stemexpress
as
the
go-to
in
california
for
planned
parenthood's
trafficking
in
baby
body
parts
and
the
biotech
company
cut
its
ties
with
planned
parenthood
shortly
after
these
were
released
cmp's
legal
team
is
arguing
in
the
preliminary
hearing
that
the
law
does
not
consider
conversations
that
can
be
overheard
confidential
and
that
covert
recording
is
allowed
when
done
to
investigate
violent
crimes
on
thursday
the
court
saw
video
clips
of
the
stemexpress
ceo
identified
as
doe
meeting
in
may
with
daleiden
and
merritt
who
were
posing
as
owners
of
a
biotech
company
doe
says
in
the
video
there's
a
great
demand
for
raw
fetal
tissue
and
that
the
insanely
fragile
neural
or
brain
tissue
is
best
shipped
in
a
whole
calvarium
or
head
whereupon
daleiden
says
just
make
sure
the
eyes
are
closed
yeah
laughs
doe
tell
the
lab
techs
its
coming
it's
almost
like
they
don't
want
to
know
what
it
is
doe
was
far
less
forthcoming
in
her
testimony
thursday
as
breen
noted
one
thing
we've
observed
throughout
these
proceedings
is
that
these
witnesses
were
much
more
candid
when
they
spoke
to
david
and
susan
on
the
undercover
video
than
they
are
on
the
stand
he
told
lifesitenews
however
we
have
been
able
to
establish
certain
facts
that
are
important
through
their
testimony
and
when
they
deviate
from
the
video
we've
been
able
to
use
the
video
to
show
that
they're
not
telling
the
truth
on
the
stand
breen
said
that's
important
to
show
that
the
attorney
general
is
using
witnesses
who
are
willing
to
stretch
the
truth
and
our
side
is
exposing
that
truth
breen
told
the
court
that
stemexpress
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
stanford
university
studies
where
langendorff
perfusion
was
used
a
technique
that
requires
a
beating
heart
does
stemexpress
supply
fetal
hearts
to
stanford
he
asked
doe
she
hesitated
to
answer
because
she
said
there's
so
much
targeting
of
researchers
however
judge
christopher
hite
told
her
the
question
was
relevant
yes
we
have
provided
heart
tissue
to
stanford
doe
said
she
also
admitted
that
cmp
photos
are
accurate
and
that
sometimes
a
baby's
intact
calvarium
is
attached
to
the
baby's
body
and
sometimes
it
is
not
in
another
key
exchange
doe
testified
that
her
company
requests
that
parties
sign
a
nondisclosure
agreement
or
nda
before
discussing
business
but
while
doe
met
with
daleiden
and
merritt
in
late
may
the
nda
for
the
meeting
was
signed
in
late
june
according
to
an
email
from
stemexpress
to
cmp
that
breen
produced
in
court
nor
was
doe
able
to
produce
evidence
the
nda
had
been
sent
to
daleiden
and
merritt
before
the
meeting
after
talking
about
how
important
a
nda
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
nda
was
not
sent
out
until
a
month
after
this
supposedly
highly
confidential
meeting
breen
told
lifesitenews
so
that
was
a
really
significant
point
that's
why
there
was
so
much
argument
on
it
he
said
at
the
same
time
the
statute
is
clear
if
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
conversation
can
be
overhead
then
it
doesn't
count
as
a
confidential
conversation
he
said
so
our
contention
is
if
you're
sitting
there
at
a
restaurant
with
wait
staff
around
you
and
coming
and
going
as
they
please
you
can
be
overheard
that's
a
clear
exception
to
the
statute
breen
also
quizzed
doe
about
the
planned
parenthood
consent
form
that
stemexpress
used
in
former
stemexpress
technician
holly
o'donnell
supplied
the
pp
consent
form
to
cmp
she
also
is
featured
in
two
cmp
videos
describing
in
graphic
detail
the
process
of
sorting
through
dismembered
arms
and
legs
of
aborted
babies
the
form
states
there
will
be
no
changes
to
the
abortion
procedure
because
of
the
decision
to
donate
blood
or
fetal
tissue
when
doe
said
she
couldn't
recall
what
the
form
said
breen
played
for
the
court
a
portion
of
the
video
tape
where
she
bragged
about
memorizing
the
pp
consent
form
down
to
the
control
numbers
he
told
lifesitenews
doe
also
told
the
court
she
couldn't
recall
what
the
current
stemexpress
consent
form
stipulates
she
wouldn't
admit
that
patients
are
not
told
their
abortion
procedures
could
be
changed
but
we
know
it
to
be
true
breen
told
lifesitenews
so
we're
using
the
videos
to
be
able
to
show
these
people
are
not
being
straight
with
the
court
he
said
and
so
you
shouldn't
believe
them
with
anything
they're
saying
the
hearing
resumes
tuesday
and
doe
returns
next
week
to
complete
her
testimony
