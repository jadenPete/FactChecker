something's
fishy
about
america's
official
inflation
data
prices
are
rising
much
faster
than
the
consumer
price
index
would
have
you
believe
when
confronted
with
the
fed's
claims
that
there's
no
inflation
in
the
economy
most
americans
who
don't
have
a
phd
in
economics
would
probably
react
with
a
mixture
of
confusion
frustration
and
disbelief
the
fed
likes
to
treat
inflation
like
a
giant
mystery
that
can't
be
cracked
but
anybody
who
has
been
to
a
restaurant
supermarket
or
paid
a
rent
check
over
the
past
decade
can
tell
you
prices
are
rising
much
faster
than
the
cpi
would
have
you
believe
the
latest
evidence
of
this
discrepancy
to
make
it
into
the
us
financial
press
arrived
this
weekend
courtesy
of
bloomberg's
annual
sushinomics
index
a
novel
cost-of-living
gauge
which
tracks
changes
in
prices
for
the
popular
japanese
cuisine
across
different
metropolitan
areas
as
it
turns
out
sushi
prices
are
a
fairly
reliable
proxy
for
the
cost
of
living
in
a
given
area
for
example
new
york
and
san
francisco
the
two
most
expensive
cities
in
the
us
also
sport
the
highest
sushi
prices
meanwhile
new
orleans
one
of
the
least
expensive
metro
areas
also
has
some
of
the
cheapest
sushi
in
the
us
the
average
prices
for
basic
sushi
rolls
in
the
big
easy
climbed
just
over
the
past
year
compared
with
an
average
national
increase
of
of
course
bbg
advises
that
sushi
shouldn't
be
used
as
an
exact
proxy
for
cost
of
living
myriad
idiosyncratic
factors
including
access
to
fresh
ingredients
cost
of
refrigeration
and
transportation
costs
as
well
as
the
competition
between
restaurants
in
a
cities
food
scene
which
could
drive
prices
down
are
at
play
when
determining
sushi
prices
here's
more
on
that
from
william
anderson
an
economics
professor
at
frostburg
state
university
in
maryland
what
you're
doing
is
looking
strictly
at
the
demand
side
but
what
are
some
of
the
other
factors
anderson
said
you
have
to
become
almost
an
expert
in
the
sushi
business
still
it's
difficult
to
ignore
the
correlation
between
factors
like
population
growth
and
sushi
prices
according
to
bbg's
index
charlotte
nc
and
houston
texas
cities
that
have
seen
their
populations
explode
over
the
past
ten
years
also
logged
some
of
the
highest
increases
in
sushi
prices
sushi
price
inflation
was
in
charlotte
and
in
houston
over
the
last
months
according
to
bbg
more
americans
are
flocking
to
these
cities
pushing
up
prices
for
amenities
like
sushi
and
staples
like
rent
as
the
prohibitive
cost
of
living
in
coastal
enclaves
like
nyc
forces
more
people
to
look
for
alternatives
to
sum
up
so
far
has
seen
the
largest
gap
percentage
points
between
sushi
prices
and
the
cpi
since
bbg
created
its
national
sushi
index
in
pardon
the
pun
but
we're
starting
to
think
there's
something
fishy
about
the
official
inflation
data
