us
slaps
new
tariffs
on
china
one
minute
later
china
retaliates
we're
going
to
win
the
fight
president
trump
says
the
biggest
reason
for
last
week's
torrid
stock
market
rally
was
rekindled
optimism
that
the
escalating
trade
war
between
the
us
and
china
may
be
on
the
verge
of
another
ceasefire
following
phone
conversations
fake
as
they
may
have
been
between
the
us
and
chinese
side
this
translated
into
speculation
that
a
new
round
of
tariffs
increases
slated
for
this
weekend
may
not
take
place
or
be
delayed
however
that
did
not
happen
and
with
no
trade
deal
in
sight
at
am
on
sunday
the
trump
administration
slapped
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
imports
the
latest
escalation
in
a
trade
war
that's
ground
the
global
economy
to
a
halt
sent
germany
into
a
recession
and
given
the
market
an
alibi
to
keep
rising
because
wait
for
it
a
trade
deal
is
imminent
only
it
isn't
and
minute
later
at
am
edt
china
retaliated
with
higher
tariffs
being
rolled
out
in
stages
on
a
total
of
about
billion
of
u.s.
goods
the
target
list
strikes
at
the
heart
of
trump's
political
support
factories
and
farms
across
the
midwest
and
south
at
a
time
when
the
u.s.
economy
is
showing
signs
of
slowing
down
the
u.s.
duty
hit
consumer
goods
ranging
from
footwear
and
apparel
to
home
textiles
and
certain
technology
products
like
the
apple
watch
a
separate
batch
of
about
billion
in
chinese
goods
including
laptops
and
cellphones
will
be
hit
with
tariffs
on
dec
china
meanwhile
began
applying
tariffs
of
to
on
u.s.
goods
ranging
from
frozen
sweet
corn
and
pork
liver
to
bicycle
tires
on
sunday
the
slated
u.s.
tariffs
on
approximately
billion
in
chinese
goods
may
affect
consumer
prices
for
products
ranging
from
shoes
to
sporting
goods
the
ap
noted
and
may
mark
a
turning
point
in
how
the
ongoing
trade
war
directly
affects
consumers
nearly
of
clothing
and
textiles
the
u.s.
buys
from
china
will
also
be
subjected
to
tariffs
until
today
the
trump
administration
has
avoided
tariffs
on
consumer
goods
even
as
the
president
claimed
that
only
china
was
paying
for
tariffs
and
consumer
spending
has
remained
high
amid
slowdowns
in
other
economic
areas
such
as
investment
spending
and
exports
president
trump's
economic
advisors
larry
kudlow
and
peter
navarro
have
consistently
argued
the
trade
conflict
will
not
or
will
minimally
affect
consumers
although
the
stated
reason
for
the
delay
in
another
bn
in
tariffs
on
consumer
goods
until
dec
is
precisely
due
to
the
administration's
fear
of
a
price
shock
ahead
of
the
holidays
beijing
has
vowed
retaliatory
tariffs
that
combined
with
the
sunday
increases
would
cover
billion
in
american
products
once
the
dec
tariffs
take
effect
as
expected
chinese
state
media
on
sunday
knocked
the
u.s.
for
the
continuing
tariffs
arguing
they
would
hurt
american
interests
as
well
according
to
reuters
the
united
states
should
learn
how
to
behave
like
a
responsible
global
power
and
stop
acting
as
a
school
bully
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
said
reuters
noted
china
has
repeatedly
slammed
us
pressure
tactics
with
signs
that
its
officials
are
girding
for
a
prolonged
confrontation
china's
determination
to
fight
against
the
u.s.
economic
warmongering
has
only
grown
stronger
and
its
countermeasures
more
resolute
measured
and
targeted
according
to
a
commentary
by
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
after
the
tariffs
kicked
in
one
thing
that
white
house
tariff
men
should
learn
is
that
the
chinese
economy
is
strong
and
resilient
enough
to
resist
the
pressure
brought
about
in
the
ongoing
trade
war
and
speaking
of
economic
impact
the
congressional
budget
office
has
projected
that
by
trump's
tariffs
and
trade
war
will
reduce
the
level
of
real
u.s.
gdp
by
about
and
reduce
average
real
household
income
by
separately
jpmorgan
has
estimated
that
the
latest
round
of
tariffs
will
increase
the
average
cost
per
u.s.
household
to
a
year
up
from
for
duties
enacted
last
year
that
estimate
is
in
the
low
range
because
it
was
based
on
a
duty
rate
of
before
trump
increased
it
to
as
bloomberg
reports
about
of
california-based
jlab
audio's
headphones
and
other
wireless
products
targeted
for
duties
got
hit
sunday
possibly
hurting
holiday
sales
and
forcing
a
delay
in
hiring

cramer
said
about
of
the
company's
sales
come
in
the
fourth
quarter
he
said
if
i
had
hair
i'd
be
pulling
it
out
cramer
said
i'm
really
concerned
about
the
financial
performance
of
the
business
knowing
that
if
we
continue
to
eat
this
cost
how
much
it
hurts
well
cramer
just
pass
the
costs
along
to
the
consumer
supposedly
the
economy
is
super
strong
and
higher
inflation
is
precisely
what
the
fed
wants
so
win-win-win
right
others
were
just
as
vocal
in
their
criticism
of
trump's
trade
war
gary
shapiro
president
of
the
consumer
technology
association
said
the
trump
administration's
approach
of
using
tariffs
to
pressure
china
into
a
deal
has
backfired
u.s.
companies
have
to
spend
more
resources
on
constantly
changing
trade
rules
and
less
on
innovation
new
products
and
our
economic
health
shapiro
said
this
is
not
how
you
reach
a
meaningful
trade
agreement
among
the
higher
chinese
duties
that
took
effect
sept
include
an
extra
on
american
pork
beef
and
chicken
and
various
other
agricultural
goods
while
soybeans
will
get
hit
with
an
extra
tariff
on
top
of
the
existing
starting
in
mid-december
american
wheat
sorghum
and
cotton
will
also
get
a
further
tariff
while
china
imposed
a
new
levy
on
u.s.
crude
oil
starting
from
september
there
was
no
new
tariff
on
liquefied
natural
gas
the
resumption
of
a
suspended
extra
duty
on
u.s.
cars
will
resume
dec
with
another
on
top
for
some
vehicles
with
existing
general
duties
on
autos
taken
into
account
the
total
tariff
charged
on
u.s.
made
cars
would
be
as
high
as
while
the
trump
administration
has
dismissed
concern
about
a
protracted
trade
war
business
groups
are
calling
for
a
tariff
truce
and
the
resumption
of
negotiations
between
the
world's
two-largest
economies
on
friday
trump
told
reporters
that
face-to-face
talks
between
chinese
and
american
trade
negotiators
scheduled
for
washington
in
september
are
still
happening
as
of
now
before
going
to
camp
david
the
u.s.
presidential
retreat
we're
going
to
win
the
fight
he
said
alex

exposes
the

owned
by

and
their
blatant
attempt
to
propagandize
