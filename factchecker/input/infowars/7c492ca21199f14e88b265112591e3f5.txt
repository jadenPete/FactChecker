mayor
pete
invokes
bible
to
justify
killing
babies
democrat
candidate
pete
buttigieg
appeared
to
support
post-birth
abortion
by
saying
that
a
baby
is
only
considered
alive
after
it's
taken
its
first
breath
during
an
appearance
on
the
breakfast
club
radio
show
on
friday
the
south
bend
mayor
claimed
that
life
doesn't
begin
until
a
baby
has
drawn
its
first
breath
suggesting
that
abortion
until
or
even
after
birth
was
morally
right
pro-life
christians
hold
everybody
in
line
with
this
one
kind
of
piece
of
doctrine
about
abortion
which
is
obviously
a
tough
issue
for
a
lot
of
people
to
think
through
morally
mr
buttigieg
said
then
again
there's
a
lot
of
parts
of
the
bible
that
talk
about
how
life
begins
with
breath
and
so
even
that
is
something
that
we
can
interpret
differently
sick
part-time
mayor
pete
buttigieg
appears
to
justify
abortion
even
after
a
baby
is
born
suggesting
life
does
not
begin
until
a
baby
takes
its
first
breath

mayor
pete
has
been
twisting
christian
values
to
fit
the
far-left's
agenda
such
as
alling
climate
change
denial
a
sin
it's
the
latest
salvo
in
a
long
string
of
attempts
by
buttigieg
to
paint
his
entire
progressive
agenda
as
the
only
acceptable
set
of
policies
for
a
moral
christian
insisting
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
christianity
will
point
you
in
a
progressive
direction
reported
the
national
review
time
and
again
the
mayor
who
considers
himself
a
faithful
episcopalian
has
derided
republicans
and
conservative
christians
for
their
supposed
hypocrisy
and
immorality
while
proclaiming
the
objective
moral
correctness
of
his
own
policy
prescriptions
buttigieg's
own
brother-in-law
who
is
himself
a
pastor
condemned
his
abortion
remarks
and
called
for
him
to
repent
i
feel
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
stewardship
of
my
faith
to
stand
up
and
say
something
to
say
no
that's
not
true
pastor
rhyan
glezman
explained
god
places
a
very
high
value
on
all
human
life
everyone
is
created
fearfully
and
wonderfully
in
the
image
of
god
with
intrinsic
value
that
doesn't
start
at
the
first
breath
it
starts
when
we
enter
our
mother's
womb
did
he
actually
call
the
fetus
a
baby
does
he
shy
away
from
the
label
