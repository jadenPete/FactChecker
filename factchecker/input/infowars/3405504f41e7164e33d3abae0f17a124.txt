which
the
two
sides
specifically
discussed
strategic
stability

we
discussed
in
detail
the
situation
with

following
the

withdrawal

intermediate-range
nuclear
forces
treaty
our
stance
on

is
well
known
it
has
been
repeatedly
confirmed
by

we
will
not
deploy
such

must
definitely
work
to
restore

in

in

to
create
the

lavrov
says
us
prepared
missile
test
long
before
its
exit
from
inf
treaty
his
comments
followed
lavrov
stating
that
the
us
had
been
preparing
tests
of
the
missile
which
is
non-compliant
with
the
inf
treaty
long
before
washington
officially
exited
the
accord
according
to
the
minister
the
preparations
could
have
begun
in
october
or
even
earlier
lavrov
also
revealed
that
us
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
had
said
during
his
visit
to
moscow
in
october
last
year
that
us
president
donald
trump's
words
about
the
need
to
withdraw
from
the
inf
were
not
an
invitation
to
dialogue
but
were
rather
a
final
decision
it
is
apparently
at
that
time
maybe
even
earlier
they
began
to
prepare
the
tests
that
were
conducted
and
which
violate
the
parameters
that
were
in
the
inf
treaty
lavrov
said
he
spoke
after
the
us
tested
its
first
non-inf
compliant
missile
on
august
weeks
after
the
country
officially
withdrew
from
the
agreement
pentagon

carver
clarified
that

was
a

the

traveled
over

before
hitting
its
target
collapse
of
inf
treaty
the
us
announced
the
commencement
of
the
withdrawal
process
in
february
claiming
that
moscow
had
violated
the
accord
by
developing
its
m
missile
which
allegedly
operates
at
banned
ranges
russia
denied
the
accusations
and
presented
the
missile
for
inspection
but
the
us
ignored
moscow's
efforts
and
used
its
claims
as
a
pretext
for
its
subsequent
withdrawal
from
the
treaty
in
response
to
washington's
decision
moscow
also
announced
that
it
would
leave
the
inf
treaty
pointing
out
that
the
us
had
ignored
moscow's
own
concerns
regarding
washington's
compliance
with
the
inf
for
years
the
inf
treaty
was
signed
in
by
the
us

deployment
of
ground-based
missiles
