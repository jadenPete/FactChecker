central
bankers
like
alan
greenspan
seem
to
think
central
bankers
can
be
trusted
to
act
with
restraint
but
that's
a
fallacy
most
people
who
have
undertaken
a
formal
study
of
economics
end
up
accepting
such
things
as
the
necessity
of
a
central
bank
to
prevent
or
at
least
ameliorate
recessions
they
take
as
a
given
the
need
for
government
intervention
in
the
economy
or
if
not
as
a
given
as
explained
by
countless
historical
incidents
of
injustice
perhaps
most
of
all
they
regard
anyone
calling
for
an
unregulated
gold
coin
standard
as
so
hopelessly
backward
and
na
ve
that
refutation
seldom
goes
further
than
rolling
one's
eyes
everyone
knows
the
gold
standard
fostered
those
nineteenth-century
panics
which
high-minded
bankers
finally
addressed
by
creating
the
federal
reserve
system
in
under
the
federal
reserve
the
government
was
able
to
create
enough
debt
to
send
our
boys
into
the
bloodbath
known
as
world
war
i
to
die
and
suffer
in
horrendous
numbers
with
the
federal
reserve
engaged
in
money
printing
including
fed
chief
benjamin
strong's
famous
coup
de
whiskey
in
stocks
soared
stupendously
from
until
they
didn't
following
the
crash
the
very
thing
the
fed
was
supposed
to
prevent
it
attempted
to
inflate
us
out
of
the
depression
that
followed
but
as
the
story
goes
was
hamstrung
in
part
by
the
barbarous
relic
gold
for
this
reason
president
roosevelt
almost
immediately
after
being
elected
in
ordered
americans
to
turn
in
their
gold
under
threat
of
fine
and
imprisonment
voila
we
then
had
the
depression
and
we
had
no
sound
money
and
what
has
happened
since
in
a
speech
before
the
economic
club
of
new
york
on
december
fed
chairman
alan
greenspan
told
his
audience
although
the
gold
standard
could
hardly
be
portrayed
as
having
produced
a
period
of
price
tranquility
it
was
the
case
that
the
price
level
in
was
not
much
different
on
net
from
what
it
had
been
in
but
in
the
two
decades
following
the
abandonment
of
the
gold
standard
in
the
consumer
price
index
in
the
united
states
nearly
doubled
and
in
the
four
decades
after
that
prices
quintupled
monetary
policy
unleashed
from
the
constraint
of
domestic
gold
convertibility
had
allowed
a
persistent
overissuance
of
money
as
recently
as
a
decade
ago
central
bankers
having
witnessed
more
than
a
half-century
of
chronic
inflation
appeared
to
confirm
that
a
fiat
currency
was
inherently
subject
to
excess
but
he
went
on
to
say
central
bankers
are
learning
to
treat
the
money
they
print
as
if
it
had
the
restraints
of
gold
or
in
his
words
a
prudent
monetary
policy
can
contain
the
forces
of
inflation
this
was
in
before
the
economy
blew
up
in
because
of
fed
money
printing
the
bernanke
solution
to
the
crisis
as
the
world
witnessed
was
even
more
aggressive
money
printing
creating
staggering
levels
of
debt
and
moral
hazard
so
that
today
financial
pundits
are
predicting
another
crisis
likely
worse
than
the
last
but
some
economists
rejected
the
perceived
need
for
government
intervention
in
the
economy
specifically
the
austrian-school
economists
maintain
that
interventions
not
only
fail
but
are
almost
always
used
to
justify
further
interventions
to
fix
the
previous
failures
see
mises's
planned
chaos
for
a
discussion
of
interventionism
this
continues
at
enormous
cost
and
suffering
until
we
find
ourselves
in
the
mess
we
are
in
today
where
democratic
candidates
in
openly
call
for
socialism
to
fix
the
failures
of
the
free
market
they
have
spent
decades
destroying
along
with
their
partners-in-crime
the
republicans
where
can
someone
get
a
straight
story
on
the
item
that
is
involved
in
virtually
every
economic
transaction
money
and
how
its
corruption
has
led
to
economic
misery
and
injustice
one
excellent
source
is
joseph
salerno's
book
money
sound
and
unsound
as
salerno
writes
in
the
introduction
t
he
new
millennium
dawned
with
the
austrian
sound
money
paradigm
thriving
but
still
ignored
by
the
mainstream
the
bursting
of
the
housing
bubble
and
the
meltdown
of
financial
markets
changed
all
this
a
small
number
of
economists
and
participants
in
financial
markets
forecast
these
events
using
the
austrian
theory
of
the
business
cycle
which
gives
the
only
coherent
explanation
of
booms
bubbles
and
depressions
word
spread
quickly
through
the
banking
and
financial
sector
and
among
the
general
public
via
the
internet
soon
several
high-profile
financial
pundits
and
other
members
of
the
official
media
were
publicly
recognizing
and
embracing
the
austrian
analysis
even
a
few
mainstream
financial
economists
were
stimulated
to
give
it
a
sympathetic
hearing
prominent
and
not-so-prominent
mainstream
economists
were
nonplussed
if
not
alarmed
by
this
spreading
challenge
to
their
authority
and
attempted
to
respond
to
it
by
engaging
austrian
business
cycle
theory
on
blogs
and
in
popular
periodicals
but
these
attempts
were
little
more
than
hysterical
diatribes
based
on
a
very
inadequate
knowledge
of
the
literature
and
a
profound
misconception
of
the
nature
and
claims
of
the
theory
in
the
meantime
the
doctrine
of
sound
money
with
austrian
monetary
and
business
cycle
theory
at
its
core
has
continued
to
flourish
and
grow
and
has
emerged
as
the
main
challenger
to
the
collapsing
keynesian
spending
paradigm
what
would
monetary
policy
look
like
under
a
gold
coin
standard
would
austrians
serve
on
the
fomc
to
impart
their
swags
would
they
concoct
mathematical
magic

unswervingly
aim

salerno

if

the
principles
of

simple
there
