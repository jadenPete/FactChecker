uncontrolled

contended
in
the

recreated
sophisticated
computer

of
the

building
based
on
actual
blueprints
of
the
building's
construction
after
a
four-year
research
project
they
found
it
was
not
likely
for
fires
to
have

enough
to
lead
to
the
collapse
at

which
can
be
witnessed
in

footage
of
the
building's
collapse
the
principal
conclusion
of
our
study
is
that
fire
did
not
cause
the
collapse
of
wtc
on
contrary
to
the
conclusions
of
nist
and
private
engineering

that
studied
the
collapse
reads
a
draft
report
the
study
looked
at
how
the
building's
design
would
have
responded
to
fires
at
the
th
floor
where
most
of
the
fires
were
said
to
have
occurred
they
also
factored
in
the
official
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology's
nist
collapse
scenario
and
ran
multiple
simulations
destroying
various
structural
points
in
order
to
identify
which
failures
would
have
needed
to
occur
for
the
collapse
to
happen
as
it
did
the
models
show
that
the
only
way
to
replicate
the
observed
collapse
is
to
simulate
the
failure
of
every
column
at
nearly
the
same
time

study
by
ae
truth
which
funded
the
research
the
study
concludes
it
is
our
conclusion
that
the
collapse
of
wtc
was
a
global
failure
involving
the
near
simultaneous
failure
of
all
columns
in
the
building
and
not
a
progressive
collapse
involving
the
sequential
failure
of
columns
throughout
the
building
despite
simulating
a
number
of
hypothetical
scenarios
we
were
unable
to
identify
any
progressive
sequence
of
failures
that
could
have
taken
place
on
september
and
caused
a
total
collapse

the
building

seconds

in-depth
research
into
the
collapse
was
never
conducted
according
to
ae
truth
because
the
debris
was
hauled
off

the
days

years

investigators
concluded
that
wtc
was
the
first
steel-framed

to
have
