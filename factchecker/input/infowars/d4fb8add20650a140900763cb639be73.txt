memory
loss
or
lying
joe
biden's
constant
gaffes
should
worry
democrats
is
joe
biden
suffering
worrying
memory
loss
and
cognitive
decline
or
is
he
just
a
liar
recent
and
past
evidence
suggests
it's
probably
both
democrats
have
a
joe
biden
problem
the
former
vp
might
still
lead
the
polls
but
with
serious
concerns
raised
about
his
memory
and
mental
state
nominating
him
to
face
donald
trump
in
is
a
risk
the
party
can't
afford
biden
relayed
a
moving
story
of
military
heroism
and
his
own
role
in
honoring
a
us
navy
captain
to
a
rapt
audience
last
week
the
problem
was
as
the
washington
post
reported
almost
every
detail
in
the
story
appears
to
be
incorrect
in
fact
biden
combined
elements
of
three
different
events
into
one
story
of
bravery
compassion
and
regret
that
never
happened
the
generous
interpretation
here
is
that
biden
did
not
intentionally
lie
but
genuinely
mixed
up
the
details
due
to
failing
memory
the
cynical
interpretation
is
that
he
embellished
in
order
to
play
up
his
own
role
in
the
tale
to
win
some
campaign
brownie
points
whatever
the
case
may
be
there's
no
good
way
to
spin
it
the
post's
report
sparked
a
flurry
of
headlines
and
speculation
about
biden's
mental
state
we
need
to
talk
about
joe
biden
reads
a
national
review
headline
joe
biden
needs
an
intervention
says
townhall
pull
it
together
joe
biden
argued
an
op-ed
in
the
post
itself
everyone
knows
biden
has
been
a
gaffe
machine
throughout
his
entire
career
and
democrats
have
always
considered
his
blunders
to
be
part
of
a
folksy
charm
but
it's
time
to
get
real
as
long
as
biden
leads
in
the
polls
trump
will
be
laughing
himself
to
sleep
just
as
they
did
in
with
hillary
clinton
a
centrist
candidate
with
a
troubling
history
who
couldn't
excite
young
and
progressive
voters
the
democrats
could
very
well
be
digging
their
own
grave
with
biden
trump
has
already
begun
to
seize
upon
biden's
increasingly
frequent
mistakes
dubbing
him
sleepy
joe
that's
in
addition
to
creepy
joe
the
other
nickname
bestowed
upon
the
former
vp
due
to
his
habit
of
showering
unwanted
physical
attention
onto
women
and
girls
following
a
recent
slew
of
mistakes
biden
assured
democrats
that
he's
not
going
nuts
but
is
he
days
before
fabricating
the
military
story
biden
appeared
to
forget
barack
obama's
name
stumbled
and
called
him
president
my
boss
instead
shortly
before
he
told
reporters
he
was
happy
to
be
in
vermont
during
a
campaign
stop
in
new
hampshire
twice
since
may
biden
has
referred
to
theresa
may
as
margaret
thatcher
earlier
this
month
he
claimed
parkland
school
shooting
survivors
visited
him
when
he
was
vice
president
but
he
was
not
vp
at
that
time
a
career
in
politics
at
biden's
level
with
busy
schedules
and
events
held
all
over
the
country
no
doubt
lends
itself
to
some
confused
dates
and
details
but
these
mixups
indicate
there
could
be
something
more
going
on
biden's
supporters
might
dismiss
these
concerns
but
they
would
be
the
first
to
point
to
similar
signs
in
trump
confusion
forgetfulness
lying
with
regularity
about
big
and
small
details
and
so
on
as
proof
that
he
is
mentally
unfit
to
lead
the
country
yet
even
if
year-old
biden
is
experiencing
memory
loss
there
could
also
be
something
more
sinister
at
play
a
recent
new
york
times
piece
recalling
biden's
calamitous
run
for
president
noted
he
was
prone
to
embellishment
this
is
otherwise
known
as
lying
over
the
years
biden
has
lied
about
having
marched
in
the
civil
rights
movement
he
has
come
under
fire
for
plagiarism
more
than
once
he
claimed
falsely
that
he
had
been
shot
at
in
iraq
perhaps
most
disturbingly
biden
has
even
lied
about
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
tragic
death
of
his
wife
and
daughter
claiming
falsely
that
curtis
dunn
the
driver
who
ran
into
their
car
was
drunk
a
police
investigation
found
that
the
crash
was
not
even
dunn's
fault
this
particular
lie
of
biden's
is
all
the
more
malevolent
when
you
consider
that
he
waited
for
dunn
to
die
himself
before
libelling
him
as
a
drunk
driver
is
joe
biden
suffering
worrying
memory
loss
and
cognitive
decline
or
is
he
just
a
liar
recent
and
past
evidence
suggests
it's
probably
both
and
the
party
will
ignore
these
red
flags
at
their
peril
democrats
already
know
biden
does
not
excite
their
base
and
more
than
a
year
away
from
the
election
the
media
has
begun
talking
about
the
biden
enthusiasm
gap
that's
the
very
same
phrase
they
used
to
describe
how
voters
felt
about
clinton
three
years
ago
this
is
all
aside
from
the
former
vp's
possibly
failing
memory
and
worrying
propensity
for
embarrassing
gaffes
if
the
democrats
are
not
careful
this
could
be
like
watching
a
replay
of
it's
not
as
though
the
party
does
not
have
options
they
are
not
perfect
by
a
long
shot
but
a
progressive
like
bernie
sanders
or
a
semi-progressive
like
elizabeth
warren
tick
more
boxes
for
young
progressive
voters
who
are
becoming
increasingly
powerful
within
the
party
biden
is
seen
as
the
safe
choice
by
many
older
moderate
democrats
but
so
was
hillary
clinton
if
there
is
one
lesson
they
should
have
learned
from
that
disastrous
choice
it's
that
centrist
establishment
candidates
are
no
match
for
a
populist
like
trump
who
can
light
a
fire
under
voters
youtube
ceo
susan
wojcicki
said
tuesday
that
it's
more
important
than
ever
for
youtube
to
remain
an
open
platform
just
one
day
after
going
on
a
massive
banning
spree
targeting
right-wingers
for
so-called
hate
speech
