new

is
preparing
to
seize
the
land
of
late
billionaire
pedophile
jeffrey
epstein's
zorro
ranch
according
to
reports
new
mexico
attorney
general
hector
balderas
found
that
epstein
whose
acre
ranch
was
a
combination
of
private
and
state-owned
property
improperly
leased
land
from
the
government
to
increase
privacy
having
fully
reviewed
the
referral
from
the
state
land
commissioner
in
connection
with
my
office's
investigation
into
criminal
conduct
related
to
jeffrey
epstein
in
new
mexico
i
am
issuing
a
determination
that
the
state
land
commissioner
should
immediately
retake
state
trust
lands
and
cancel
leases
that
were
improperly
given
to
him
balderas
said
in
a
statement
the
original
leases
to
epstein
appear
to
have
no
beneficial
use
justification
to
the
state
but
rather
appear
to
simply
have
been
taken
by
him
to
increase
privacy
and
the
landmass
surrounding
his
estate
this
sweetheart
deal
must
be
canceled
and
reassigned
to
a
new
mexico
ranching
family
leasing
documents
from
the
s
indicated
that
epstein
would
use
the
federal
land
to
graze
cattle
according
to
the
new
york
post
however
no
evidence
of
epstein
owning
any
cattle
was
found
as
we
reported
epstein
planned
to
use
his
zorro
ranch
as
a
breeding
hub
for
his
transhumanist
goal
of
seeding
the
human
race
with
his
dna
by
systmatically
impregnating
dozens
of
women
authorities
say
that
the
damning
allegations
against
epstein
is
reason
enough
to
seize
the
federal
land
and
possibly
conduct
of
search
of
the
ranch
which
is
the
only
property
of
epstein's
that
hasn't
been
raided
the
rising
number
of
allegations
from
survivors
saying
they
were
trafficked
to
the
zorro
ranch
is
reason
enough
for
us
to
rip
these
leases
in
half
and
seize
back
this
public
land
land
commissioner
stephanie
garcia
said
in
a
statement
epstein
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
under
suspicious
circumstances
earlier
this
month
and
despite
having
a
broken
hyoid
bone
indicative
of
strangling
the
coroner
ruled
his
sudden
death
a
suicide
