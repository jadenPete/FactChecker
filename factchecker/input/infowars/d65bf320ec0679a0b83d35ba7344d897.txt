tucker
takes
victory
lap
after
trump
fires
john
bolton
we'll
have
to
wait
and
see
if
trump
makes
a
good
appointment
for
a
change
or
if
he
just
picks
another
terrible
neocon
this
is
hilarious
from
fox
news
tucker
went
straight
into
interviewing
the
great
col
douglas
macgregor
who
tucker
no
doubt
wants
trump
to
pick
to
replace
bolton
col
macgregor
had
a
very
solid
appearance
and
tucker
said
outright
i
hope
trump
listens
to
you
we'll
have
to
wait
and
see
if
trump
makes
a
good
appointment
for
a
change
or
if
he
just
picks
another
terrible
neocon
trump
on
wednesday
signaled
he's
open
to
lifting
sanctions
on
iran
and
possibly
approving
a
billion
iran
bailout
so
it's
not
entirely
impossible
that
he
could
change
course
zach
vorhies
and
robert
barnes
join
the
alex
jones
show
to
break
down
trump's
antiwar
tactics
