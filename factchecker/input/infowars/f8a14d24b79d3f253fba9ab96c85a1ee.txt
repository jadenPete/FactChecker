exercising

calories
bad
for
bone
health
study
findings
were
a
surprise
to
researchers
a
new
study
published
today
in
the
journal
of
bone
and
mineral
research
shows
how
bones
in
mammals
are
negatively
impacted
by
calorie
restriction
and
particularly
by
the
combination
of
exercise
and
calorie
restriction
maya
styner
md
associate
professor
of
medicine
at
the
unc
school
of
medicine
is
the
senior
author
on
the
study
these
findings
were
somewhat
of
a
surprise
for
us
styner
said
past
studies
in
mice
have
shown
us
that
exercise
paired
with
a
normal
calorie
diet
and
even
a
high-calorie
diet
is
good
for
bone
health
now
we're
learning
this
isn't
true
for
exercise
along
with
a
calorie-restricted
diet
styner's
research
focuses
on
the
fat
in
bone
marrow
of
mice
although
fat
in
the
bone
is
poorly
understood
to
date
it
is
thought
to
be
harmful
to
bones
of
mammals
including
humans
because
it
makes
bone
weaker
less
fat
is
usually
an
indication
of
better
bone
health
styner's
past
studies
have
looked
at
the
effects
of
calorie
consumption
on
bone
marrow
fat
along
with
the
role
exercise
plays
she's
found
that
in
obesity
caused
by
excess
calories
the
amount
of
bone
marrow
fat
is
increased
exercise
in
both
obese
and
normal-weight
mice
decreased
bone
marrow
fat
and
improved
the
density
of
bones
the
latest
study
looked
at
what
happens
to
bone
marrow
fat
and
overall
bone
health
when
restricting
calories
there
were
four
groups
of
mice
in
all
a
group
on
a
regular
diet
rd
a
group
on
a
calorie-restricted
cr
diet
an
rd
group
that
exercised
and
a
cr
group
that
exercised
mice
in
the
cr
group
ate
percent
less
than
what
rd
mice
ate
for
context
in
humans
according
to
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
usda
a
moderately
active
woman
around
the
age
of
should
consume
calories
per
day
a
percent
reduction
would
equal
a
diet
of
calories
per
day
which
is
around
the
amount
suggested
to
most
women
trying
to
lose
weight
at
a
rate
of
one
pound
a
week
alex

discusses
the
negative
affects
of
antibiotics
when
we
give
them
to
children
as
well
as
farmers
feeding
them
into
our
food
supply
styner
found
that
mice
in
the
cr
group
lost
weight
but
also
had
an
increase
in
bone
marrow
fat
this
was
mild
caloric
restriction
and
we
found
a
significant
increase
of
fat
in
the
bone
marrow
styner
said
this
group
also
had
a
decrease
in
bone
quantity
they
had
less
bone
overall
due
to
the
cut
in
calories
both
cr
groups
of
mice
were
given
supplements
of
vitamins
and
minerals
to
match
the
amount
the
rd
group
received
from
the
extra
food
they
ate
this
styner
says
is
an
indication
that
the
effect
on
bone
health
was
from
calorie
restriction
and
not
a
lack
of
nutrients
when
exercise
was
introduced
to
the
cr
group
bone
marrow
fat
decreased
as
it
had
in
previous
studies
but
the
overall
quantity
and
quality
of
bone
decreased
as
well
instead
of
making
bones
more
robust
exercise
made
bones
more
fragile
when
paired
with
calorie
restriction
looking
at
this
from
a
human
perspective
even
a
lower
calorie
diet
that
is
very
nutritionally
sound
can
have
negative
effects
on
bone
health
especially
paired
with
exercise
said
styner
this
is
important
for
women
to
consider
because
as
we
age
our
bone
health
starts
to
naturally
decline
your
calorie
intake
and
exercise
routine
can
have
a
great
impact
on
the
strength
of
your
bones
and
your
risk
for
break
or
fracture
styner
says
her
team
is
now
planning
to
conduct
more
research
to
understand
the
purpose
of
bone
marrow
fat
and
why
it
is
affected
by
diet
and
exercise
this
study
was
funded
by
grants
from
the
national
institutes
of
