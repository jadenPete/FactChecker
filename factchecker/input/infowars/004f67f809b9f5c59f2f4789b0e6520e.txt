johnson
says
he'd
rather
be
dead
in
a
ditch
than
ask
eu
for
brexit
delay
it
achieves
absolutely
nothing
what
on
earth
is
the
point
of
further
delay
he
added
the
british
prime
minister
said
he
would
never
ask
the
eu
for
an
extension
of
the
brexit
deadline
he'd
rather
be
dead
in
a
ditch
instead
meanwhile
parliament
is
close
to
forcing
him
to
go
to
brussels
the
remarks
were
delivered
by
boris
johnson
on
thursday
during
a
speech
after
his
visit
to
a
police
training
center
in
west
yorkshire
when
asked
by
a
reporter
if
he
could
promise
the
british
public
he
would
never
go
to
brussels
to
ask
for
a
new
brexit
delay
johnson
replied
affirmatively
and
emphatically
added
that
he
would
rather
be
dead
in
a
ditch
while
the
pm
was
apparently
adamant
in
his
refusal
to
kowtow
to
the
european
union
he
managed
to
dodge
a
direct
question
from
a
reporter
asking
if
he
would
resign
rather
than
request
the
brexit
prolongation
instead
the
tory
bigwig
simply
reiterated
his
calls
to
get
brexit
done
and
said
that
any
delays
would
be
totally
pointless
it
achieves
absolutely
nothing
what
on
earth
is
the
point
of
further
delay
he
added
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
johnson
plans
to
deliver
on
his
bold
promise
given
the
string
of
defeats
he
has
suffered
which
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
parliament
majority
and
the
adoption
of
a
bill
that
actually
obliges
him
to
go
and
seek
a
new
three-month
extension
to
prolong
the
brexit
process
during
tuesday's
commons
debates
johnson
vowed
to
obey
the
law
when
it
comes
to
the
bill
so
once
the
formalities
are
settled
he
will
likely
be
forced
to
go
to
brussels
or
be
dead
in
a
ditch
if
he's
as
good
as
his
word
needless
to
say
the
statement's
disproportionate
resoluteness
promptly
drew
all
kinds
of
jokers
to
yet
again
mock
the
british
pm
many
were
not
eager
to
take
johnson's
promise
at
face
or
any
value
bringing
up
his
past
history
of
making
big
promises
and
not
keeping
them
such
as
his
vow
to
prevent
the
third
runway
at
heathrow
airport
from
ever
getting
constructed
issued
during
his
time
as
london's
mayor
johnson
ran
away
from
voting
on
the
issue
back
in
while
the
latest
monstrous
plan
of
the
airport
expansion
was
unveiled
earlier
this
year
apart
from
the
ditch
remark
many
were
irked
by
another
prime-ministerial
gaffe
from
the
event
during
his
speech
a
policewoman
standing
right
behind
him
collapsed
while
johnson
joked
about
it
and
said
it
was
a
signal
for
him
to
wind
up
alex
jones
is
holding
president
trump
accountable
for
his
role
in
the
federal
government's
spy
grid
and
control
infrastructure
