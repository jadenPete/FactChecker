daryl
davis
was
a
speaker
at
an
ending
racism
event
organized
by
minds
which
was
part
of
a
series
intended
to
create
dialogue
and
promote
viewpoint
diversity
davis
a
musician
is
a
race
relations
expert
who
has
spent
years
speaking
to
and
rehabilitating
members
of
groups
like
the
kkk
about
antifa
members
showed
up
to
protest
ending
racism
which
was
moved
from
a
new
jersey
theater
to
a
center
in
pennsylvania
because
antifa
threatened
to
burn
down
the
theater
davis
told
the
daily
caller
news
foundation
some
antifa
members
called
davis
who
is
black
a
white
supremacist
for
attending
the
event
owen
shroyer
and
will
johnson
join
the
alex
jones
show
to
expose
the
violent
mindless
zombies
allowed
to
roam
the
streets
i
laughed
i
thought
it
was
funny
davis
told
the
dcnf
what
it
proves
is
they
had
no
point
they
had
no
evidence
of
anything
when
it
boils
down
to
just
name
calling
people
and
you
don't
show
any
proof
and
you
refuse
to
talk
to
them
they
refused
to
even
come
in
there
were
no
klansman
or
neo-nazi's
in
there
or
alt-right
people
antifa
was
invited
to
come
inside
and
attend
the
after-party
but
refused
davis
said
many
antifa
members
are
aware
of
davis
and
the
work
he
has
done
he
said
davis
attended
the
unite
the
right
rally
in
charlottesville
virginia
where
he
spoke
to
members
of
both
sides
continuing
his
work
to
help
individuals
involved
in
any
extremist
group
to
lessen
violence
and
racism
in
america
they
antifa
want
to
shut
down
any
dialogue
with
racists
people
who
have
differing
views
of
their
own
davis
said
their
thing
is
you
know
just
beat
it
out
of
them
or
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
meet
antifa
is
a
radical
group
heading
in
the
same
direction
as
the
kkk
davis
added
he
mentioned
the
kkk's
typical
attire
of
covering
their
faces
with
hoods
and
masks
to
cover
their
identity
noting
that
antifa
is
now
the
one
wearing
the
bandanas
across
their
face
or
the
masks
a
lot
of
these
groups
let's
take
black
lives
matter
let's
take
antifa
let's
take
the
ku
klux
klan
none
of
these
groups
today
are
centralized
he
said
they're
all
autonomous
it's
the
same
thing
with
antifa
half
of
them
may
believe
in
what
they're
doing
they
may
believe
that
they're
doing
some
good
but
i
truly
believe
that
the
other
half
of
them
antifa
are
simply
into
anarchy
they're
anti-racist
so
they're
gonna
go
beat
up
people
who
are
racist
but
this
is
the
exact
same
thing
the
racists
do
they're
not
behaving
any
differently
davis
has
been
called
just
about
every
name
from
race
traitor
to
oreo
to
a
pimp
and
a
prostitute
he
wrote
on
facebook
he
noted
it
was
the
first
time
he
was
called
white
supremacist
adding
it
threw
me
for
a
loop
if
it
boils
down
to
my
being
called
a
white
supremacist
obviously
they've
lost
the
case
davis
said
if
you're
that
strong
and
set
in
your
view
just
sit
down
and
have
a
conversation
beating
it
out
of
them
is
not
gonna
work
