hungary's
populist
prime
minister
viktor
orb
n
says
the
sickness
of
europe
is
the
continent's
native
population
decline
as
he
urged
for
more
incentives
to
encourage
citizens
to
have
children
during
a
speech
at
budapest's
rd
demographic
summit
orb
n
warned
that
the
biggest
problem
europe
faced
was
demographic
suicide
why
is
this
the
case
it's
most
certainly
not
because
of
some
sickness
of
christian
civilization
after
all
the
number
of
christians
are
rising
all
around
the
world
this
is
a
sickness
of
europe
in
general
he
said
the
prime
minister
said
that
the
solution
was
not
to
import
vast
numbers
of
migrants
asserting
we
must
never
accept
population
exchange
according
to
orb
n
the
remedy
should
be
to
ensure
that
families
were
financially
rewarded
for
having
children
not
punished
we
win
only
if
we
can
build
a
system
where
those
who
bear
children
live
significantly
better
than
if
they
hadn't
started
a
family
he
said
orb
n
emphasized
that
the
west
was
doomed
if
the
current
model
of
atomization
and
demographic
decline
isn't
halted
without
families
and
children
the
national
community
will
disappear
said
orb
n
adding
and
if
a
nation
disappears
something
irreplaceable
will
disappear
from
the
world
as
we
previously
highlighted
as
part
an
effort
to
boost
the
country's
population
without
having
to
rely
on
mass
migration
hungary
will
hand
out
to
married
couples
who
have
three
or
more
children
a
married
couple
receives
the
as
a
loan
from
the
government
upon
getting
married
the
loan
then
has
to
be
repaid
until
the
couple
has
three
children
at
this
point
the
debt
is
completely
forgiven
