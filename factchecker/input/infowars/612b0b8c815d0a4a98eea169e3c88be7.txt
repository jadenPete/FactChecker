in
march
on

consulate
thousands
of
protesters
sang
the
star

banner
while
waving
american
flag
this
certainly
won't
help
perceptions
from
the
mainland
after
a
summer
that's
witnessed
beijing
authorities
repeatedly
blame
a
us
hidden
hand
for
fueling
the
hong
kong
crisis
thousands
of
protesters
sunday
were
heard
calling
for
president

to
liberate
the
chinese-controlled
territory
reuters
reports
the
appeal
for
us
intervention
was
made
during
a
march
in
front
of
the
us
consulate
thousands
of
protesters
earlier
sang
the
star
spangled
banner
and
called
on
u.s.
president
donald
trump
to
liberate
the
city
they
waved
the
stars
and
stripes
and
placards
demanding
democracy
the
demonstrators
directly
handed
petitions
to
us
consular
officials
reportedly
while
chanting
fight
for
freedom
stand
with
hong

the
call
for
us
intervention
comes
interestingly
even
after
hk
leader
carrie
lam
publicly
announced
wednesday
she
was
formally
withdrawing
the
controversial
extradition
bill
which
sparked
the
protests
earlier
this
summer
in
the
first
place
thousands
of
hong

protesters
chant
the
u.s.

call
on

donald

sunday's
protesters
called
for
the
passing
of
the
proposed
hong
kong
human
rights
and
democracy
act
by
us
congress
and
handed
out
flyers
and
petitions
reuters
reported
further
that
protesters
in
a
petition
handed
to
the
u.s.
consulate
urged
that
it
be
passed
in
full
the
proposed
act
would
require
washington
each
year
to
made
a
formal
assessment
of
hong
kong's
level
of
autonomy
from
beijing
and
allow
the
us
to
take
punitive
trade
measures
if
autonomy
is
compromised
also
interesting
is
that
china
a
month
ago
formally
complained
to
us
diplomatic
officials
over
viral
photos
showing
a
us
official
from
hk
consulate
meeting
with
well-known
anti-beijing
protest
leaders
and
activists
mainland
state
media
had
featured
the
meeting
and
it
was
widely
held
up
as
proof
of
the
black
hand
of
us
government
involvement
in
the
increasingly
violent
anti-beijing
demonstrations
a
common
theme
of
mainland
coverage
of
the
protests
have
been
to
blame
us
covert
action
for
fomenting
unrest
a
photo
taken
by
a
passerby
shows
the
meeting
between
hk
separatists
and
julie
eadeh
the
political
unit
chief
of
uscg
at
jw
marriott
hotel
at
pm
thursday
it's
wildly
used
by
local
media
as
an
evidence
of
how
close
the
us
politicians
are
related
to
the
anti-gov't
movements

reported
at
the
time
china
sent
a
clear
and
firm
message
to
us
diplomats
that
china
firmly
opposes
any
contacts
with
them
and
urges
u.s.
to
stop
sending

breakers
in

sunday's
pr
move
to
gain
the
greater
attention
of
both
trump
and
the
us
congress
certainly
won't
help
in
dissuading
beijing
that
there
isn't
a
us-hk
conspiracy
afoot
