mostly
low-skilled
legal

represent

in
there
were
million
servant

workers
in

a

since
they
earn

around
a

which
is
less

the
typical
american
worker
the
stats
serve
as
a
reminder
that
a
two
caste
society
is
being
created
in
the
west
a
vast
underclass
primarily
made
up
of
cheap
labor
migrants
and
the
rich
one

to
whom
they
prostrate
themselves
as

slaves
the
super
rich
need
to
keep
importing
migrants

american
people

maintain
their

for

real
wage
growth
continues
to
stagnate

people
are
forced

work
longer
hours
to
maintain

wage
growth
for
the

class
stands

just
percent
for

of
americans
a
recent
gallup
poll
survey
revealed
that
americans
now
work
more
hours
than
any
country
in

is
it
any
coincidence
that
deaths

are
also
at
