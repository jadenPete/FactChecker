fed
buys
billion
in
us
bonds
in
two
weeks
treasury
needs
all
the
help
it
can
get
financing
the
massive
government
deficits
has
qe
already
started
for
the
first
time
since
october
the
federal
reserve
has
bought
a
significant
number
of
us
treasurys
over
the
past
two
weeks
the
fed
purchased
billion
in
us
bonds
up
until
weeks
ago
it
had
been
weeks
since
the
central
bank
bought
a
meaningful
number
of
us
treasurys
after
ending
qe
in
the
fed
held
its
treasury
holdings
stable
at
around
trillion
until
it
began
its
balance
sheet
reduction
efforts
in
late
the
fed
sold
off
treasurys
through
and
most
of
tapering
off
over
the
summer
as
it
prepared
to
end
qt
this
fall
now
it
appears
the
fed
has
started
a
new
period
of
treasury
purchases
but
as
the
econimica
blog
says
who
knows
for
how
long
global
bubble
bursting
fed
holding
the
pin
the
federal
reserve
is
crashing
the
debt
real
estate
bubble
it
created
worldwide
in
july
the
federal
reserve
cut
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
decade
at
the
time
peter
schiff
said
it
was
the
first
cut
on
the
road
to
zero
and
another
round
of
qe
was
in
the
cards
it
shouldn't
come
as
a
complete
surprise
that
the
fed
has
pivoted
back
to
buying
treasurys
so
quickly
there
were
hints
that
the
central
bank
was
planning
to
begin
monetizing
the
massive
us
debt
again
last
spring
in
april
the
us
treasury
department
lowered
its
borrowing
estimate
for
q
in
anticipation
of
the
fed
increasing
treasury
holdings
as
the
central
bank
ended
its
balance
sheet
reduction
program
according
to
a
statement
issued
by
the
treasury
department
at
the
time
the
lower
estimate
was
due
to
changes
in
fiscal
activity
so
what
exactly
does
fiscal
activity
mean
according
to
the
unnamed
treasury
official
interviewed
by
reuters
the
fiscal
change
related
to
the
fed's
plans
to
stabilize
its
massive
portfolio
of
bonds
relative
to
the
size
of
the
us
economy
in
february
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
confirmed
that
the
central
bank
will
end
its
balance
sheet
reduction
program
this
year
according
to
the
fed
chair
the
balance
sheet
will
remain
at
about
to
of
gdp
that
would
mean
the
new
normal
for
the
federal
reserve
balance
sheet
would
come
in
at
between
trillion
and
trillion
treasurys
make
up
a
significant
amount
of
that
balance
sheet
interestingly
the
fed
is
continuing
to
sell
off
mortgage-backed
securities
according
to
econimica
the
fed
has
suggested
it
will
continue
rolling
off
mbs
in
exchange
for
t's
indefinitely
in
other
words
the
central
bank
is
shifting
its
holding
aways
from
mortgage-backed
securities
and
increasing
the
amount
of
us
bonds
it
holds
raping
of
the
west's
economy
dr
nick
begich
breaks
down
the
booming
middle
class
in
asia
and
exposes
how
the
west's
economy
has
been
systematically
transferred
eastward
to
allow
for
this
financial
boom
especially
in
china
this
is
good
news
for
uncle
sam
the
us
treasury
needs
all
the
help
it
can
get
financing
the
massive
us
government
deficits
the
fiscal
year
deficit
has
already
eclipsed
the
budget
shortfall
for
the
entirety
of
fy
it's
too
early
to
say
the
fed
has
definitively
launched
another
round
of
qe
this
could
be
an
anomaly
but
billion
in
treasury
purchases
over
two
weeks
should
certainly
raise
some
eyebrows
as
the
author
of
econimica
wrote
since
march
when
the
fed
rolled
out
its
plan
the
fed
has
ended
its
treasury
runoff
sooner
than
they
had
communicated
cut
rates
as
they
said
they
would
not
and
is
buying
mid
and
long-duration
bonds
while
aggressively
rolling
off
selling
off
notes
and
bills
again
opposite
to
what
they
previously
communicated
insinuated
i
think
this
is
noteworthy
trump
warns
that
a
dem
election
will
crash
the
economy
president
trump
accurately
points
out
that
the
election
of
a
democrat
will
have
serious
negative
ramifications
to
the
market
