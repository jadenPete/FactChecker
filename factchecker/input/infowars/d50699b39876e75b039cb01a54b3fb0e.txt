is
driving
this
central

gold-buying
spree

schiff
has
talked
about
central
bank
gold-buying
he
has
noted

the
us
went
off
the
gold
standard
in

he
thinks
the
world
is
going
to
go
back
on
it
the
days
where
the
dollar
is
the
reserve
currency
are
numbered
and
we're
going
back
to
basics
you
know
everything
old
is
new
again
gold
was
money
in
the
past
and
it
will
be
money
again
in
the
future
and
central
banks
that
are
smart
enough
to
read
that
writing
on
the
wall
are
increasing
their
gold
reserves
now
you
are
not
even
close
to
ready
for
the
coming
chaos

conservatives
can't
recognize
the
leftist
call
for
civil

heard
and
how
to
prepare
for
impending
chaos
