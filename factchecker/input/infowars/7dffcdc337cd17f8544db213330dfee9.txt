put

russia's
bet
on
gold
looks
better
every
month
the
russian
central
bank's
gold
reserves
have
topped
billion
thanks
to
continued
buying
and
surging
prices
russia
added
another
tons
of
gold
to
its
hoard
in
july
that
pushed
its
purchases
on
the
year
to
just
over
tons
russia's
gold
stash
now
totals
around
tons
and
accounts
for
of
its
total
reserves
the
country
has
the
fifth-largest
gold-holdings
in
the
world
the
russians
have
been
buying
gold
for
the
last
several
years
in
an
effort
to
diversify
away
from
the
us
dollar
russian
gold
reserves
increased
tons
in
marking
the
fourth
consecutive
year
of
plus-
ton
growth
meanwhile
the
russians
sold
off
nearly
all
of
its
us
treasury
holdings
according
to
bank
of
america
analysts
the
amount
of
us
dollars
in
russian
reserves
fell
from
to
in
vladimir
miklashevsky
a
strategist
at
danske
bank
a
s
in
helsinki
told
bloomberg
there
is
a
massive
substitution
of
us
dollar
assets
by
gold
a
strategy
which
has
earned
billions
of
dollars
for
the
bank
of
russia
just
within
several
months
mike
adams
exposes
the
agenda
of
the
private
fed
as
a
war
against
the
prosperity
of
americans
that
simply
want
to
make
america
great
but
as
the
bloomberg
report
noted
russia's
gold-buying
spree
isn't
so
much
about
benefiting
from
the
rising
price
it's
about
diversification
one
analyst
told
bloomberg
the
central
bank
is
unlikely
to
have
pursued
the
goal
of
earning
in
the
process
of
managing
gold
reserves
and
more
specifically
it's
about
minimizing
the
united
states
ability
to
use
a
weaponized
dollar
against
the
russian
government
as
peter
schiff
pointed
out
during
an
interview
on
rt
last
spring
other
countries
around
the
world
have
grown
weary
of
the
us
using
the
dollar
as
a
billy
club
other
countries
don't
like
this
and
to
the
extent
that
they
can
move
away
from
the
dollar
well
then
they
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
one
way
of
doing
that
is
to
increase
their
gold
reserves
now
while
gold
is
still
cheap
because
when
the
dollar
really
starts
to
tank
the
price
of
gold
is
going
to
soar
russia
right
now
obviously
wants
to
buy
as
much
gold
as
it
can
while
the
price
is
still
relatively
cheap
that
allows
it
to
build
up
a
bigger
hoard
of
gold
to
replace
the
diminished
value
that
the
dollar
is
going
to
play
as
a
reserve
currency
the
russians
along
with
the
chinese
have
made
other
moves
in
an
attempt
to
diminish
us
dollar
hegemony
there
has
been
talk
in
russia
of
creating
a
gold-backed
cryptocurrency
along
with
the
creation
of
an
alternative
to
the
dollar-based
swift
payment
system
these
moves
could
also
set
the
stage
to
topple
the
dollar
as
the
world's
reserve
currency
simply
put
russia
and
china
are
tired
of
the
us
using
the
dollar
as
a
foreign
policy
billy
club
and
they
are
looking
for
ways
to
push
back
we've
even
seen
us
allies
looking
for
alternatives
to
the
dollar
system
last
year
the
eu
announced
plans
to
develop
a
special
payment
channel
to
circumvent
us
economic
sanctions
and
facilitate
trade
with
iran
in
june
it
was
reportedly
nearly
ready
to
begin
operation
peter
has
said
eventually
the
dollar
will
fall
from
its
perch
as
the
reserve
currency
ultimately
the
us
won't
have
any
leverage
at
all
this
the
dollar
as
the
reserve
currency
was
an
exorbitant
privilege
that
the
us
has
enjoyed
for
decades
but
it
has
abused
that
privilege
dramatically
even
more
so
recently
with
the
sanctions
so
i
think
that
privilege
is
going
to
be
lost
and
with
it
will
go
the
artificially
high
standard
of
living
that
came
along
with
it
in
the
united
states
this
is
exactly
why
countries
like
russia
and
china
are
buying
gold
the
days
that
the
dollar
is
a
reserve
currency
are
numbered
and
the
smart
central
banks
are
trying
to
buy
as
much
gold
as
they
can
before
the
number
is
up
president
trump
accurately
points
out
that
the
election
of
a
democrat
will
have
serious
negative
ramifications
to
the
market
