the
liberal

descended
into
a
full-blown
meltdown
tuesday
over
the
resignation
of
neocon
john
bolton
as
president
trump's
national
security
advisor
leftist
outlets
like
cnn
the
new

times
the
washington
post
msnbc
and
even
the
daily
beast
quickly
came
to
the
defense
of
the
notorious
republican
war
hawk
after
trump
announced
his
departure
even
clinton
operatives
like
ben
rhodes
lamented
that
one
of
their
establishment
allies
has
been
ousted
from
trump's
cabinet
neocon
darlings
mitt
romney
and
ben

cheerlead
a
fiercely
republican
pro-war
figure
who
is
against

because
they
just
really
hate

exposes
the
elite
globalist
desire
to
dominate
and
exterminate
humanity
