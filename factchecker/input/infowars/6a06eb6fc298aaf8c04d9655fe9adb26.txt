across
sweden
the
leader
of
the
party
sweden
democrats
jimmie
kesson
has
penned
an
opinion
piece
in
the
daily
newspaper
aftonbladet
spelling
out
what
he
called
more
reality-based
immigration
politics
compared
with
other
parties
while
placing
the
blame
for
what
he
claimed
to
be
a
man-made
migrant
crisis
on
the
ruling
social
democrats
and
welcoming
the
centre-right
liberal-conservative
moderates
recent
message
to
reduce
asylum
immigration
kesson
called
this
measure
unambitious
according
to
kesson
sweden
should
limit
the
number
of
accepted
asulym
seekers
to
zero
as
long
as
the
situation
remains
as
problematic
as
today
furthermore
life
in
the
so-called
parallel
society
should
be
made
impossible
while
those
who
are
in
sweden
illegally
must
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
country
or
efficiently
identified
and
taken
into
custody
pending
an
expulsion
kesson
contended
the
sweden
democrats
long-standing
leader
also
argued
that
the
country's
migration
board
should
more
pronouncedly
work
on
repatriation
which
he
called
the
last
step
in
responsible
refugee
assistance
a
huge
chinese
cargo
ship
has
unloaded
troops
and
vehicles
into
hong
kong
amidst
rumors
of
a
military
crackdown
on
protesters
in
conclusion
kesson
suggested
that
the
entire
perception
of
migration
must
change
according
to
him
citizenship
can
no
longer
be
something
that
is
almost
automatically
distributed
to
those
who
have
been
here
long
enough
as
a
minimum
anyone
who
becomes
a
swedish
citizen
must
be
able
to
understand
swedish
understand
and
respect
swedish
laws
and
regulations
and
show
an
understanding
of
social
codes
norms
and
values
kesson
concluded
in
his
opinion
piece
co-signed
with
sweden
democrat
immigration
spokesperson
paula
bieler
the
idea
of
repatriating
migrants
pioneered
ahead
of
the
election
by
the
right-wing

for
sweden
which
was
formed
by

thought
their

catching

in

society
last
week
svenska
dagbladet's
leading
conservative
columnist
ivar
arpi
sparked
a
debate
by
suggesting
in
a
series
of
tweets
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
sweden
to
consider
annual
repatriation
of
refugees
migration
agency

lower
for
some
reason
though
those
who
have
already
received
refugee
status
are
not
affected
by
this
why
not
in
a
reasonable
world
this
would
have
meant
that
the
syrians
who
had
come
here
now
would
begin
to

while
arpi's
idea
was
supported
by
other

commenters
such
as
annie

who
suggested
the
very
same
thing
he
was
immediately
branded
racist
by
the
liberal-leaning
press
meanwhile
the
sweden
democrats
remain
a
pariah
in
the
swedish
parliament
despite
being
the
country's
third-largest
party
with
percent
of
the
vote
as
the
sweden
democrats
were
conspicuously
left
out
of
the
recent
cross-party
talks
on
escalating
violence
in
the
country
kesson
suggested
this
was
tantamount

kicking
