he
said
in
response
to
the
mass
retirement
of
house
republicans
rush
limbaugh
suggested
that
some
of
them
are
being
blackmailed
into
leaving
office
the
radio
host
said
it's
odd
that
a
exorbitant
number
of
republicans
are
retiring
almost
simultaneously
i
think
the
democrats
are
finding
dirt
and
they're
going
to
these
republicans
and
they're
saying
do
you
want
people
to
know
about
this
we
are
glad
to
publicize
this
about
you
oh
no
no
no
no
please
don't
well
okay
then
you
gotta
retire
limbaugh
stated
on
wednesday
now
i
can't
prove
it
but
some
of
this
stuff
and
some
of
it
may
be
legitimate
i
mean
people
retiring
after
ten
years
they
may
think
it's
enough
it's
five
terms
but
it's
a
lot
of
power
to
be
giving
up
it
just
seems
to
be
that
these
retirements
are
predominantly
republican
and
it's
all
happening
under
the
radar
limbaugh
also
downplayed
suggestions
that
house
republicans
are
retiring
simply
because
they
don't
like
president
trump
that's
not
what
it
is
that's
what
they
want
you
to
think
that's
not
what
it
is
he
continued
what
i
really
think
is
going
is
that
a
lot
of
this
is
being
done
as
opposition
research
dirty
tricks
what
have
you
by
democrats
who
are
hell-bent
on
taking
back
texas
or
converting
texas
to
their
column
so
far
several
texan
republicans
have
announced
their
retirements
from
the

lost
an
unprecedented
amount
of
power
on
the
state

federal
level

limbaugh
also
pointed
out
barack
obama

a
death
star
for
the

his
two
presidential
elections

democrat
party
