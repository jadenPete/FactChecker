u.s.
on
step
six
of
the
eight-step
collapse
of
civilization
hard
work
patience
and
discipline
crumbling
away
like
rust
hit
by
wind
but
weak
times
eventually
lead
to
strong
people
an
american
industrialist
once
described
the
rise
and
fall
of
historic
civilizations
as
an
eight
step
cycle
and
western
society
fits
well
into
step
six
while
risking
a
rapid
advance
into
the
hellscape
of
step
seven
and
beyond
in
henning
webb
prentis
jr
wrote
what
was
later
called
the
prentis
cycle
which
describes
an
eight
step
cycle
of
civilization
bondage
to
spiritual
faith
spiritual
faith
to
courage
courage
to
liberty
liberty
to
abundance
abundance
to
selfishness
selfishness
to
apathy
apathy
to
dependency
dependency
to
bondage
and
the
cycle
thus
returns
to
the
beginning
the
release
of
initiative
and
enterprise
made
possible
by
popular
self-government
ultimately
generates
disintegrating
forces
from
within
prentis
stated
again
and
again
after
freedom
has
brought
opportunity
and
some
degree
of
plenty
the
competent
become
selfish
luxury-loving
and
complacent
the
incompetent
and
the
unfortunate
grow
envious
and
covetous
and
all
three
groups
turn
aside
from
the
hard
road
of
freedom
to
worship
the
golden
calf
of
economic
security
to
describe
step
six
of
the
prentis
cycle
which
is
often
misattributed
to
alexander
tytler
it's
the
point
where
many
lose
the
sense
that
they
must
work
hard
to
achieve
prosperity
instead
they
grow
too
comfortable
living
off
the
sacrifices
of
previous
generations
a
microcosm
of
this
is
the
all-too-common
year-old
man
still
living
on
his
parents
couch
the
act
of
taking
without
giving
grows
commonplace
to
the
point
where
it
emerges
as
a
rising
political
ideology
hard
work
patience
and
discipline
crumble
away
like
rust
hit
by
wind
does
this
sound
a
lot
like
the
current
state
of
america
unfortunately
today's
cultural
climate
also
bears
striking
similarities
with
step
seven
from
apathy
to
dependence
at
this
stage
an
increasing
number
of
people
don't
have
the
ability
or
even
the
desire
to
work
fruitfully
dependence
of
the
system
is
seen
as
the
only
means
to
provide
their
basic
and
even
their
indulgent
needs
the
idea
of
self-determination
fades
away
as
the
masses
give
more
power
to
politicians
who
promise
more
free
stuff
remember
the
rollout
of
the
green
new
deal
that
promised
economic
security
to
those
unwilling
to
work
furthermore
just
compare
step
seven
to
the
campaign
platforms
of
several
presidential
candidates
the
good
news
however
is
that
weak
times
create
strong
people
and
the
cycle
will
eventually
wind
its
way
back
to
the
beginning
where
bondage
gives
way
to
spiritual
fulfillment
and
the
resulting
prosperity
norm
pattis
brings
his
legal
expertise
to
the
alex
jones
show
and
explains
how
common
law
forged
by
liberty
is
giving
away
to
an
authoritarian
agenda
