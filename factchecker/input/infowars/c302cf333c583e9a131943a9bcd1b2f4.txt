xenophobic
violence
is
flaring
once
again
in
south
africa
where
black
south
africans
are
setting
fire
to
other
african
migrants
and
attacking
foreign-owned
businesses
rioters
looted
shops
created
flaming
barricades
on
roads
and
engaged
in
street
fights
with
police
as
attacks
on
immigrants
and
foreign-owned
businesses
increase
reported
rt
some
businesses
were
looted
and
damaged
on
sunday
alone
it's
the
second
outbreak
of
such
violence
in
the
country
in
the
space
of
a
week
shocking
video
shows
black
south
africans
setting

the
violence
was
sparked
after
a
south
african
driver
was
shot
dead
by
a
drug
dealer
who
was
a
foreign
national
the
wave
of
xenophobic
violence
prompted
the
zambian
ministry
of
transport
and
communications
to
instruct
zambian
drivers
not
to
travel
through
the
country
the
mainstream
media
has
largely
avoided
the
story
refusing
to
give
it
top
billing
presumably
because
of
who
is
responsible
rest
assured
comedy
central
host
trevor
noah
knows
who
is
really
to
blame
for
this
latest
explosion
black-on-black
violence
white
people
why
because
colonialism
or
something
during
similar
violence
back
in
in
a
lengthy
social
media
post
noah
said
that
white
land
ownership
and
wealth
was
the
real
driving
factor
south
africans
and
nigerian
migrants
are
fighting
in
the
streets
but
trevor
noah
found
a
way
to
blame
white
people

whites
in
south
africa
makes
up
about
of
the
population
and
controls
over
wealth
noah
wrote
so
when
i
hear
south
africans
claiming
that
other
africans
are
competing
with
them
on
dwindling
scarce
resources
i
say
that
your
anger
and
outrage
is
misplaced
african
immigrants
don't
own
lands
don't
run
companies
don't
own
mining
companies
don't
operate
trophy
hunting
companies
do
not
ship
out
capital
to
european
banks
yours
is
a
complete
misplaced
anger
prejudice
and
xenophobia
built
up
out
of
inferiority
complex
created
by
decades
of
apartheid
and
oppression
he
added
the
post
is
re-circulating
once
again
in
light
of
recent
events
noah's
words
are
downright
disturbing
not
only
does
he
largely
absolve
the
perpetrators
of
such
vicious
violence
of
blame
he
almost
seems
to
be
suggesting
their
anger
would
be
better
directed
at
white
people
let's
hope
noah
remains
silent
this
time
around
