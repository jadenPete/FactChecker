this
study
introduces
an
effective
strategy
for
parents
wanting
to
address
this
deficiency
this
study
recruited
families
with
children
between
the
ages
of
four
and
six
where
low
consumption
of
vegetables
was
reported
parents
completed
an
online
survey
and
attended
an
information
meeting
prior
to
participating
three
groups
were
created
children
introduced
to
a
single
vegetable
children
to
receive
multiple
vegetables
and
a
group
where
eating
habits
were
not
changed
study
data
were
collected
in
several
ways
two
dinner
meals
served
at
the
research
facility
during
which
children
could
eat
as
much
of
the
broccoli
cauliflower
and
green
beans
as
they
wished
changes
to
actual
vegetables
consumed
at
home
childcare
or
school
recorded
through
food
diaries
and
parents
reporting
on
usual
vegetable
consumption

strategies
of
offering
vegetables
were
parent-led
and
home-based
families
introducing
one
vegetable
served
broccoli
and
families
trying
multiple
vegetables
served
broccoli
zucchini
and
peas
parents
were
provided
with
a
voucher
to
purchase
the
vegetables
and
given
instructions
on
portion
size
and
cooking
instructions
along
with
tips
on
how
to
offer
the
vegetables
children
were
served
a
small
piece
of
vegetable
three
times
a
week
for
five
weeks
a
sticker
was
given
as
a
reward
to
children
trying
a
vegetable
there
was
no
difference
between
groups
at
the
start
of
the
study
for
any
of
the
methods
measured
the
dinner
meal
during
which
the
children
ate
without
parents
present
did
not
increase
consumption
perhaps
due
to
an
unfamiliar
setting
vegetable
acceptance
increased
for
both
the
single
and
multiple
vegetable
groups
during
the
intervention
families
that
offered
multiple
vegetables
recorded
an
increase
in
consumption
from
to
servings
while
no
change
in
consumption
was
observed
in
families
serving
a
single
vegetable
or
families
that
did
not
change
their
eating
habits
increased
acceptance
for
multiple
vegetables
was
noted
during
the
five
weeks
of
the
study
and
sustained
at
three-month
follow-up
following
the
study
parents
reported
that
offering
the
vegetables
was
very
easy
or
quite
easy
with
the
majority
following
the
instructions
provided
by
the
study
dr
poelman
recommended
while
the
amount
of
vegetables
eaten
increased
during
the
study
the
amount
did
not
meet
dietary
guidelines
nonetheless
the
study
showed
the
strategy
of
offering
a
variety
of
vegetables
was
more
successful
in
increasing
consumption
than
offering
a
single
vegetable
