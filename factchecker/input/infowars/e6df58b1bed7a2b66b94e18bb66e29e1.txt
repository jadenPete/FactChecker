breakthrough
sheds
light
on
black
holes
dark
energy
researchers
claim
they've
barely
begun
to
scratch
the
surface
two
university
of
hawaii
at
manoa
researchers
have
identified
and
corrected
a
subtle
error
that
was
made
when
applying
einstein's
equations
to
model
the
growth
of
the
universe
physicists
usually
assume
that
a
cosmologically
large
system
such
as
the
universe
is
insensitive
to
details
of
the
small
systems
contained
within
it
kevin
croker
a
postdoctoral
research
fellow
in
the
department
of
physics
and
astronomy
and
joel
weiner
a
faculty
member
in
the
department
of
mathematics
have
shown
that
this
assumption
can
fail
for
the
compact
objects
that
remain
after
the
collapse
and
explosion
of
very
large
stars
for
years
we've
generally
operated
under
the
assumption
that
the
universe
in
broad
strokes
was
not
affected
by
the
particular
details
of
any
small
region
said
croker
it
is
now
clear
that
general
relativity
can
observably
connect
collapsed
stars
regions
the
size
of
honolulu
to
the
behavior
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
over
a
thousand
billion
billion
times
larger
croker
and
weiner
demonstrated
that
the
growth
rate
of
the
universe
can
become
sensitive
to
the
averaged
contribution
of
such
compact
objects
likewise
the
objects
themselves
can
become
linked
to
the
growth
of
the
universe
gaining
or
losing
energy
depending
on
the
objects
compositions
this
result
is
significant
since
it
reveals
unexpected
connections
between
cosmological
and
compact
object
physics
which
in
turn
leads
to
many
new
observational
predictions
one
consequence
of
this
study
is
that
the
growth
rate
of
the
universe
provides
information
about
what
happens
to
stars
at
the
end
of
their
lives
astronomers
typically
assume
that
large
stars
form
black
holes
when
they
die
but
this
is
not
the
only
possible
outcome
in
erast
gliner
a
young
physicist
at
the
ioffe
physico-technical
institute
in
leningrad
proposed
an
alternative
hypothesis
that
very
large
stars
should
collapse
into
what
could
now
be
called
generic
objects
of
dark
energy
geodes
these
appear
to
be
black
holes
when
viewed
from
the
outside
but
unlike
black
holes
they
contain
dark
energy
instead
of
a
singularity
in
two
independent
teams
of
astronomers
discovered
that
the
expansion
of
the
universe
is
accelerating
consistent
with
the
presence
of
a
uniform
contribution
of
dark
energy
it
was
not
recognized
however
that
geodes
could
contribute
in
this
way
with
the
corrected
formalism
croker
and
weiner
showed
that
if
a
fraction
of
the
oldest
stars
collapsed
into
geodes
instead
of
black
holes
their
averaged
contribution
today
would
naturally
produce
the
required
uniform
dark
energy
the
results
of
this
study
also
apply
to
the
colliding
double
star
systems
observable
through
gravitational
waves
by
the
ligo-virgo
collaboration
in
ligo
announced
the
first
observation
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
colliding
double
black
hole
system
such
systems
were
expected
to
exist
but
the
pair
of
objects
was
unexpectedly
heavy
roughly
times
larger
than
the
black
hole
masses
predicted
in
computer
simulations
using
the
corrected
formalism
croker
and
weiner
considered
whether
ligo-virgo
is
observing
double
geode
collisions
instead
of
double
black
hole
collisions
they
found
that
geodes
grow
together
with
the
universe
during
the
time
leading
up
to
such
collisions
when
the
collisions
occur
the
resulting
geode
masses
become
to
times
larger
in
rough
agreement
with
the
ligo-virgo
observations
croker
and
weiner
were
careful
to
separate
their
theoretical
result
from
observational
support
of
a
geode
scenario
emphasizing
that
black
holes
certainly
aren't
dead
what
we
have
shown
is
that
if
geodes
do
exist
then
they
can
easily
give
rise
to
observed
phenomena
that
presently
lack
convincing
explanations
we
anticipate
numerous
other
observational
consequences
of
a
geode
scenario
including
many
ways
to
exclude
it
we've
barely
begun
to
scratch
the
surface
the
dark
crystal
series
showcases
a
dramatization
of
actual
practices
of
those
who
want
to
consume
the
essence
of
innocence
