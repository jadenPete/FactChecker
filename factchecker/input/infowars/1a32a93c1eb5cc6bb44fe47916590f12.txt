this
is
why
so
many
americans
are
deathly
afraid
of
going
to
the
hospital
the
u.s.
healthcare
system
accounts
for
nearly
a
fifth
of
our
entire
economy
and
if
it
was
a
country
it
would
have
the
fifth
largest
gdp
on
the
entire
planet
what
you
are
about
to
read
in
this
article
is
likely
to
make
you
very
angry
once
upon
a
time
the
primary
mission
of
our
hospitals
was
to
help
people
but
today
they
have
become
vicious
financial
predators
many
americans
try
very
hard
to
avoid
visiting
the
hospital
because
of
what
it
might
cost
but
if
an
emergency
happens
there
is
no
choice
they
often
get
us
when
we
are
at
our
most
vulnerable
and
they
never
explain
to
us
in
advance
how
much
their
services
will
actually
cost
and
then
eventually
when
the
bills
start
arriving
we
discover
that
they
have
charged
us
dollars
for
a
single
aspirin
or
for
a
feeding
tube
it
is
a
giant
scam
but
they
have
been
getting
away
with
it
for
decades
and
so
they
just
keep
on
doing
it
and
many
hospitals
go
after
those
that
are
not
able
to
pay
their
ridiculous
bills
extremely
aggressively
just
consider
the
following
example
which
comes
to
us
from
usa
today
i
can't
imagine
any
surgery
that
should
ever
cost
you
can
buy
an
entire
house
for
that
amount
of
money
it
is
highway
robbery
and
those
that
are
engaged
in
this
sort
of
predatory
pricing
are
literally
crooks
ptsd
blood
tests
have
been
proposed
to
see
if
vets
have
the
heightened
aggressive
and
anxious
traits
of
a
victim
of
ptsd
to
prevent
them
from
buying
guns
sadly
heather
waldron
and
john
hawley
have
a
lot
of
company
over
the
past
six
years
the
university
of
virginia
health
system
has
sued
patients
yes
the
university
of
virginia
health
system
saves
lives
every
single
day
but
the
way
that
they
are
running
their
operation
is
bringing
great
shame
to
the
entire
state
of
virginia
of
course
there
are
many
other
hospitals
all
across
the
country
that
are
behaving
in
a
similar
manner
this
next
example
comes
from
cnn
are
you
kidding
me
hernandez
didn't
stay
overnight
and
she
didn't
have
any
surgery
how
in
the
world
can
that
hospital
possibly
justify
a
bill
for
more
than
like
i
said
they
are
a
bunch
of
crooks
but
their
racket
is
completely
legal
and
those
participating
are
becoming
exceedingly
wealthy
at
our
expense
if
you
can
believe
it
the
university
of
virginia
health
system
has
made
a
profit
of
million
over
the
past
six
years
and
the
ceo
brings
in
an
exceedingly
bloated
salary
our
healthcare
system
is
deeply
deeply
broken
and
it
is
destroying
lives
all
across
america
a
single
trip
to
the
hospital
can
ruin
you
financially
for
the
rest
of
your
life
and
one
recent
survey
found
that
health
costs
are
the
main
financial
worry
for
americans
aged
to
and
that
same
survey
discovered
that
a
substantial
percentage
of
respondents
have
actually
been
avoiding
the
healthcare
system
because
of
what
it
might
cost
in
america
today
percent
of
all
bankruptcies
are
related
to
medical
bills
and
most
of
those
that
go
bankrupt
actually
have
health
insurance
those
that
follow
my
work
regularly
know
that
i
have
been
writing
about
these
things
for
a
long
time
and
i
am
deeply
frustrated
that
things
just
seem
to
get
worse
with
each
passing
year
at
one
time
the
medical
profession
was
a
noble
path
and
those
that
sacrificed
so
much
to
help
others
were
greatly
admired
but
now
the
healthcare
system
in
america
has
become
a
cesspool
of
greed
and
for
many
of
those
that
are
attracted
to
it
the
main
goal
is
to
make
as
much
money
as
possible
just
because
it
is
currently
legal
that
does
not
mean
that
the
predatory
behavior
of
the
industry
is
moral
the
u.s.
healthcare
system
accounts
for
nearly
a
fifth
of
our
entire
economy
and
if
it
was
a
country
it
would
have
the
fifth
largest
gdp
on
the
entire
planet
but
at
this
point
it
has
become
a
great
shame
to
the
entire
nation
and
it
needs
to
be
completely
torn
down
and
rebuilt
from
scratch
