darpa
preparing
to
snuff
out

had
to
apologize
a
new

times
journalist
recently
invoked
his
totalitarian
oversight
on
a
twitter
user
for
insulting
him
don
lemon
still
continues
to
berate
the
president
and
deem
his
followers
racists
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
witness
stepped
forward
recounting
his
vile
behavior
and
even
the
cat
lady
back
at
snopes
couldn't
verify
axios
claim
that
president
trump
suggested
nuking
a
hurricane
which
the
president
denied
saying
of
course
that
is
just
a
sampling
of
recent
full
blown
fake
news
and
derelict
activity
from
the
incestuous
corporate
dominated
media
conglomeration
that
the
public
is
addicted
to
a
public
averaging
hours
per

ingesting
the
propaganda
obama
legalized
in
a
bloomberg
article
titled

claims
darpa
has
announced
that
it
is
creating
custom
software
that
can
unearth
fakes
hidden
among
more
than
stories
photos
video
and

clips
if
successful
the
system
after
four
years
of
trials
may
expand
to
detect
malicious
intent
and
prevent
viral
fake

from
polarizing

one
would
assume
that
darpa
would
use
this
esque
software
to
straighten
out
the
rampant
fake
news
plaguing
the
mainstream
media
but
all
signs
point
to
a
weaponization
of
software
aimed
at
targeting
what
darpa
deems
air
quotes
disinformation
the
same
supposed
disinformation
the
social
media
giants
have
banned
the
same
disinformation
labeled
by
big
media
what
is
this
disinformation
a
hyper-distortion
of
the
only
thing
standing
between
our
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
complete
totalitarian
leftist
propaganda
control
an
alternative
media
that
will
never
give
up
on
exposing
the
goliath
of
corruption
threatening

all
