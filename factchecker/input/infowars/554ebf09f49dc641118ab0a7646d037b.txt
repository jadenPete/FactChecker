a
category
storm
if
the
scale
went
that
high
hurricane
dorian
would
be
one
now
we
are
dealing
with
a
hurricane
that
is
so
intense
that
it
could
be
considered
to
be
a
category
storm
if
the
saffir
simpson
scale
was
expanded
hurricane
dorian
is
already
setting
all
sorts
of
records
and
it
hasn't
even
reached
the
united
states
yet
as
i
write
this
article
this
lawnmower
from
the
sky
is
ripping
through
the
bahamas
with
immense
fury
the
east
coast
could
potentially
be
the
next
target
and
widespread
evacuations
have
already
been
ordered
all
along
the
florida
coastline
and
that
even
includes
president
trump's
mar-a-lago
resort
for
many
years
there
has
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
debate
in
the
scientific
community
about
whether
we
should
add
a
new
category
to
the
saffir
simpson
scale
because
of
how
powerful
hurricanes
are
becoming
many
meteorologists
have
advocated
adding
a
category
or
even
a
category
to
the
scale
and
without
a
doubt
the
power
of
hurricane
dorian
will
almost
certainly
renew
that
debate
and
as
you
will
see
below
if
the
scale
had
already
been
expanded
hurricane
dorian
would
likely
be
considered
to
be
a
category
storm
right
now
let's
start
with
what
we
already
know
according
to
the
latest
information
from
the
national
hurricane
center
hurricane
dorian
currently
has
maximum
sustained
winds
of
miles
per
hour
we
are
also
being
told
that
wind
gusts
exceeding
mph
have
been
detected
and
at
this
point
dorian
has
already
become
far
more
powerful
than
most
of
the
models
were
anticipating
so
how
does
this
storm
stack
up
against
some
of
the
other
monster
storms
in
recent
history
well
according
to
weather
underground
dorian
has
already
tied
the
all-time
record
for
strongest
landfalling
atlantic
hurricane
dorian
is
now
tied
for
having
the
second-highest

any
atlantic

record

and
if
it
gets
just
a
little
bit
stronger
it
could
potentially
have
the
strongest
winds
that
we
have
seen
in
any
atlantic
hurricane
ever
on
the
saffir
simpson
scale
hurricanes
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
mph
to
mph
are
considered
to
be
category
storms
and
any
storm
with
sustained
winds
of
mph
or
greater
is
considered
to
be
a
category
storm
if
we
gave
category
the
same
mph
range
that
category
has
that
would
mean
that
category
would
hypothetically
begin
at
mph
and
since
hurricane
dorian
currently
has
sustained
winds
of
mph
that
would
make
it
a
category
storm
on
our
hypothetical
scale
the
good
news
is
that
hurricane
dorian
appears
to
be
making
a
sharp
turn
and
may
not
actually
make
landfall
in
the
u.s.
at
all
if
that
is
what
ultimately
takes
place
that
will
be
extremely
good
news
but
this
storm
has
proven
to
be
exceedingly
unpredictable
so
far
and
anything
could
still
happen
by
tomorrow
morning
the
forecast
may
have
completely
changed
once
again
and
the
storm
could
once
again
be
making
a
beeline
for
the
coast
if
dorian
does
make
landfall
in
the
u.s.
the
devastation
is
likely
to
be
exceedingly
great
just
check
out
what
dorian
is
doing
to
the
bahamas
at
this
moment
as
the
eyewall
of
the
storm
hit
the
island
it
bent
utility
poles
and
snapped
trees
and
beat
buildings
with
the
howling
wind

the

could
be
in
for
a
similar
fate
and
the
noaa
is
specifically
warningthat
just
a
small
deviation
to
the
left
of
the
track
could
bring
the
intense
core
of
the
hurricane
directly
over
the
florida
coast
given
the
uncertainty
in
the
track
forecast
and
the
anticipated
increase
in
size
of
the
hurricane
a
hurricane
warning
and
storm
surge
warning
have
been
issued
for
a
portion
of
the
florida
east
coast
it
is
once
again
emphasized
that
although
the
official
track
forecast
does
not
show
landfall
users
should
not
focus
on
the
exact
track
a
small
deviation
to
the
left
of
the
track
could
bring
the
intense
core
of
the
hurricane
its
dangerous
winds
closer
to
or
onto
the
florida
coast
we
are
entering
a
time
when
many
of
our
old
assumptions
will
no
longer
apply
this
is
going
to
be
an
era
of
great
turmoil
for
our
planet
and
we
are
seeing
bizarre
weather
extremes
all
over
the
world
in
so
far
this
year
we
have
seen
one
of
the
bitterly
coldest
winters
in
a
century
unprecedented
rainfall
and
flooding
in
the
middle
of
the
country
thousands
of
wildfires
burning
the
lungs
of
the
earth
to
the
ground
and
record
high
temperatures
all
over
the
planet
this
summer
now
we
are
dealing
with
a
hurricane
that
is
so
intense
that
it
could
be
considered
to
be
a
category
storm
if
the
saffir
simpson
scale
was
expanded
and
many
people
believe
that
this
is
just
the
beginning
let's
keep
a
very
close
eye
on
this
storm
if
it
starts
heading
toward
you
get
out
while
you
still
can
because
you
definitely
don't
want
to
be
there
when
this
monster
storm
hits
