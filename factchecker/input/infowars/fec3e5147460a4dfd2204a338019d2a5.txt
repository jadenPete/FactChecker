house
announced
the
f-
partnership
with
turkey
was
over

turkey
could
still
get
hit
with
u.s.
sanctions
part
of
the
continuing
fallout
over
its
decision
to
accept
delivery
of
russia's
s-
air
defense
system
in
july
they
are
not
out
of
the

on

state
department
assistant
secretary
for
political-military
affairs
r.
clarke
cooper
told
reporters
in
washington
thursday
all
the
options
are
on
the
table
he
said
adding
washington
has
no
timeline
for
making
a
decision
tensions
between
turkey
a
key
u.s.
and
nato
ally
and
washington
have
been
growing
over
the
past
year
sparked
in
part
by
u.
s
support
for
some
kurdish
forces
in
syria
in
the
fight
against
the
islamic
state
terror
group
but
ankara's
decision
to
go
ahead
with
purchase
of
the
advanced
russian-made
air
defense
system
has
been
equally
thorny
for
months
the
u.s.
had
warned
ankara
that
by
accepting
the
s-
it
was
jeopardizing
its
relationship
and
risked
losing
its
role
as
a
key
partner
in
the
production
of
the
f-
joint
strike
fighter
the
most
advanced
in
the
u.s.
fleet
following
russia's
july
delivery
of
the
s-
the
white
house
announced
the
f-
partnership
with
turkey
was
over
costing
turkish
companies
an
estimated
billion
turkey's
decision
to
purchase
russian
s-
air
defense
systems
renders
its
continued
involvement
with
the
f-
impossible
the
white
house
said
in
a
statement
at
the
time
describing
the
s-
as
a
russian
intelligence
collection
platform
that
will
be
used
to
learn
about
its
advanced
capabilities
accepting
the
s-
undermines
the
commitments
all
nato
allies
made
to
each
other
to
move
away
from
russian
systems
the
white
house
added
on
thursday
cooper
said
some
of
the
penalties
turkey
faces
are
mandated
by
law
including
some
that
could
be
levied
under
the
countering
america's
adversaries
through
sanctions
act
caatsa
but
he
said
other
factors
were
also
at
play
turkey's
an
interesting
case
because
we
have
a
number
of
partners
where
we
have
growing
relationships
with
who
are
closely
watching
how
turkey
is
managed
cooper
said
but
he
also
expressed
some
hope
that
relations
between
the
u.s.
and
turkey
could
be
repaired
depending
on
who
one
talks
to
in
the
turkish
government
there
are
those
who
are
acutely
aware
and
sensitive
and
appreciative
that
this
is
not
over
and
are
wanting
to
get
back
to
how
things
may
have
been
cooper
added
decisions
coming
out
of
ankara
are
not
necessarily
reflective
of
the
military
institution
or
the
foreign
ministry
separately
cooper
said
the
recent
approved
sale
of
f-
fighters
to
poland
for
billion
was
unrelated
to
the
decision
to
oust
turkey
from
the
program
the
poland
purchase
was
well
within
the
works
way
before
we
had
to
impose
a
break
with
turkey
