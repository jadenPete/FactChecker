is

in

a
move
that's
at

with
warren's
progressive
image
and
people
really
aren't
happy
about
it
the
two
have
been
in
communication
since
the

announced
her

it
isn't
clear
how
often
the
two
women
speak
or
what
they
discuss
but
a
source
close
to
the
former
secretary
of
state
said
their
contact
has
been
recent
and
has
clearly
not
gone
unnoticed
warren's
team
reportedly
don't
want
to
speak
about
clinton
likely
because
of
her
loss
to
donald
trump
in
and
her
unpopularity
with
progressive
democrats
as
well
as
with
vermont
senator
bernie
sanders
supporters
the
news
that
warren
is
in
talks
with
clinton
has
sparked
anger
on
social
media
with
some
calling
her
a
centrist
opportunist
and
saying
she
is
not
an
ally
to
bernie
but
to
the
establishment
others
mocked
her
for
taking
advice
from
the
woman
who
lost
to
trump
while
one
even
predicted
warren
would
pick
clinton
to
be
her
vice-president
this
won't
help
her
whatsoever
why
is
warren
associating
herself
w
the
second
most
hated
politician
in
the
u.
s
both
were
registered
republicans
at

why
would
any
candidate
want
to
consort
with
the
most
toxic
politician
of
our
time
the

september
hillary
pretty
openly
favored
maintaining
the
status
quo
a
big
part
of
why
she
lost
warren
is
more
insidious
because
like
obama
she
pretends
to
be
a
candidate
who
favors
sweeping
change
when
in
fact
she's
just
another
case
of
meet

although
centrist
clinton
is
problematic
within
progressive
circles
of
the
democratic
party
she
holds
sway
within
its
establishment
and
would
absolutely
have
influence
over
a

of
delegates
to
the

convention
