senator
rand
paul
congratulated
president
trump
tuesday
night
for
ousting
the
neocon
warmonger
john
bolton
purging
the
hawk
from
his
administration
for
good
trump
announced
the
change
of
national
security
adviser
saying
that
he
disagreed
strongly
with
many
of
bolton's
suggestions
as
did
others
in
the
administration
it's
not
hard
to
imagine
given
that
bolton
is
obsessed
with
pursuing
military
action
against
the
likes
of
iran
and
north
korea
while
trump
has
repeatedly
said
he
sees
such
an
eventuality
as
a
waste
of
resources
and
an
endangerment
of
us
lives
appearing
on
fox
news
sen
rand
paul
slammed
the
door
behind
bolton
on
his
way
out
noting
that
the
neocon's
deranged
drive
for
regime
change
in
the
mideast
is
naive
and
threat
of
war
around
the
world
is
greatly
diminished
with
bolton
out
of
the
white
house
i
think
bolton
has
been
very
wrong
and
naive
and
i'm
glad
to
see
him
gone
paul
said
adding
and
i
hope
the
president
can
find
someone
who
actually
agrees
with
what
the
president
says
i
think
he
had
a
naive
point
of
view
for
the
world
that
we
should
topple
regimes
everywhere
and
institute
democratic
governments
and
we
would
make
the
world
perfect
or
remake
the
world
in
our
image
and
frankly
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way
paul
said
of
bolton
this
president
is
extraordinary
paul
continued
noting
that
he
said
great
nations
don't
fight
perpetual
wars
and
he
is
absolutely
right
but
that
defies
the
orthodoxy
of
the
establishment
foreign
policy
in
washington
so
he
really
needs
to
find
somebody
who
has
the
guts
to
stand
up
to
the
orthodoxy
not
someone
who
is
part
of
the
swamp
paul
concluded
paul
also
tweeted
support
for
the
firing
of
bolton
saying
the
move
was
a
necessary
action
