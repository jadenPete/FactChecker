andrew
yang
turned
into
oprah
winfrey
thursday
revealing
free
money
was
the
big
surprise
he's
been
building
up
for
days
during
his
opening
comments
the
former
businessman
who
supports
a
universal
basic
income
said
he
was
going
to
do
something
no
other
candidate
had
ever
done
before
give
to
families
it's
time
to
stop
trusting
politicians
and
start
trusting
ourselves
so
i'm
going
to
do
something
unprecedented
tonight
yang
said
my
campaign
is
now
going
to
give
a
freedom
dividend
of
a
month
to
american
families
for
an
entire
year
someone
watching
this
at
home
right
now
the
move
reflects
the
candidate's
universal
basic
income
proposal
to
give
american
families
a
a
month
allowance
we'll
see
if
the
bold
move
pays
