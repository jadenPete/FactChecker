president
donald
trump's
tweeting
habits
have
long
been
speculated
to
move
the
markets
but
now
there
is
a
way
to
supposedly
measure
it
courtesy
of
j.p.
morgan
and
it's
called
volfefe
after
the
mysterious
covfefe
the
behemoth
financial
company
and
provider
of
indices
of
all
sorts
says
the
us
president
has
increased
the
number
of
tweets
in
recent
months
affecting
the
markets
and
his
every
tweet
about
the
federal
reserve
china
and
trade
tensions
is
seen
as
impactful
on
near-term
economic
performance
the
authors
of
the
j.p.
morgan
report
say
with
the
new
index
named
after
trump's
mysterious
covfefe
tweet
the
analysts
try
to
explain
and
show
how
the
tweets
affect
year
and
year
treasuries
the
company's
report
said
tweets
out
of
authentic
messages
during
market
hours
from
to
the
present
had
an
impact
on
markets
most
often
they
included
words
such
as
china
billion
and
products
and
got
favorable
responses
owen
shroyer
and
alex
jones
discuss
leftist
policies
contributing
to
the
rising
homeless
epidemic
the
report
delves
into
specific
details
of
trump's
tweeting
habits
he
has
an
average
of
tweets
a
day
and
produced
more
than
since
his
inauguration
most
of
tweets
come
between
noon
and
pm
the
report
says
noting
that
the
ones
around
pm
can
cause
trouble
for
us
market
rates
the
study
also
assumes
that
the
president
is
asleep
between
am
to
am
the
markets
experienced
deep
dives
in
the
summer
as
trump
intensified
the
tariff
war
with
china
yet
the
dow
is
up
percent
since
the
presidential
election
it
just
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
volfefe
index
is
effective
or
will
it
end
up
in
the
category
of
bizarre
indices
like
the
high
heels
or
beer
consumption
ones
globalism
was
conceived
to
sabotage
the
renaissance
and
plunge
humanity
into
a
new
dark-age
