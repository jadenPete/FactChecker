responded
to
the

statement
saying
most
of
the

in
the
clw
report
are
false
we
did
find
during
our
investigation
that
the
percentage
of
dispatch
workers
exceeded
our
standards
and
we
are
working
closely
with
foxconn
to
resolve
this
issue
according
to
the
south
china
morning
post
we
looked
into
the
claims
by
china
labour

and
most
of
the
allegations
are
false
we
have
confirmed
all
workers
are
being
compensated
appropriately
including
any
overtime
wages
and
bonuses
all
overtime
work
was
voluntary
and
there
was
no

it
will
launch
