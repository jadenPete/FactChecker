an

for
the
christian
democrats
and
finland's
former
interior
minister
criticized
the
evangelical
lutheran
church
of
finland
eclf
on
facebook
over
its
participation
in
helsinki's
gay
pride
week
how
does
the
foundation
of
the
church's
teachings
the
bible
fit
with
elevating
sin
and
shame
as
reasons
for
pride
r

posted
alongside
an
image
of
a
bible
opened
to
romans
from
the
new
testament
the
bible
verse
describes
homosexuality
as
sinful
shameful
and
unnatural

opening
an

on
charges

responded
by
saying
she
was
criticizing
church
leadership
not
gay
people
and
that
the
investigation
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
finnish
society
it
seems
that
many
christians
in
my
country
are
now
hiding
and
going
to
the
closet
now
that
the
lgbt-community
has
come
out
to
the
public
she
said
however
eclf
bishop
taipo
luoma
doubled
down
saying
that
same-sex
couples
are
welcome
at
all
church
activities
and
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
the
church
started
performing
same-sex
marriages
