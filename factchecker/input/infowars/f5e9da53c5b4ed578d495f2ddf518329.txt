are
staging
a
die-in
to
protest
against

of
canada's
first
chick-fil-a
with
one
demonstrator
drawing
attention
to
the
oppressed
bodies
of
the
chickens
animal
rights
and
lgbt
activists
have
gathered
outside
the
company's
store
in
toronto
to
unite
against
hate
hey
hey
ho-ho
homophobia's
got
to
go
they
chanted
the
sight
of
a
customer
in
a
maga
hat
also
caused
multiple
nervous
breakdowns
the
demonstrations
haven't
deterred
customers
who
joined
a
long
line
outside
the
fast
food
restaurant
to
get
their
hands
on
a
tasty
chicken
sandwich
the
store
has
said
it
won't
close
its
doors
and
will
remain
open
throughout
the
rest
of
today
and
saturday
lgbt
activists
are
upset
at
chick-fil-a's
homophobia
because
the
company
has
previously
given
charitable
donations
to
conservative
causes
one
activist
announced
via
a
megaphone
that
the
event
was
crucial
to
draw
attention
to
the
oppressed
bodies
of
the
chickens

do
we
simultaneously
make
vegans
look
stupid
while
ensuring
a
bumper
weekend
in
profits
for
canada's
first
