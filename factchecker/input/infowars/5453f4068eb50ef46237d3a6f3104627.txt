dead
from
to
the
suicide
rate
of

jumped
a
new
study
published
last
week
sounds
the
alarm
on
a
suicide
crisis
that
is
crushing
rural
america
from
to
the
suicide
rate
of
americans

researchers
noted
in

network
open
the
study
found
americans
living
in
rural
communities
had
a
higher
probability
of
taking
their
own
life
than
those
in
cities
the
study
contextual
factors
associated
with
county-level
suicide
rates
in
the
united
states
to
was
led
by
danielle
steelesmith
a
postdoctoral
fellow
at
ohio
state
university's
wexner
medical
center
said
suicide
rates
have
been
increasing
in
rural
america
thanks
to
increasing
poverty
low
incomes
farming
bust
deindustrialization
and
vast
amounts
of
underemployment
steelesmith
said
from
to
there
were
suicides
among
americans
ages
to
with
the
most
significant
amount
occurring
after
through
about
of
the
deaths
were
male
and
many
were
middle-aged
adults
the
highest
observed
suicide
rates
were
in
the
west
including
in
colorado
new
mexico
utah
and
wyoming
appalachia
including
counties
in
kentucky
virginia
west
virginia
and
the
ozarks
including
counties
in
arkansas
and
missouri
the
study's
social
fragmentation
index
includes
levels
of
single-person
households
unmarried
residents
and
resident
impermanence
high
social
fragmentation
was
associated
with
counties
with
higher
suicide
rates
with
the
availability
of
guns
at
walmart
and
the
proliferation
of
gun
shops
across
the
central
and
midwest
states
over
the
last
two
decades
access
to
firearms
in
rural
communities
has
notably
driven
up
suicides
the
dehumanizing
advancements
in
transhumanist
posthuman
evolution
are
being
done
with
impunity
in
china
oren
miron
a
researcher
at
the
clalit
research
institute
in
israel
said
the
jump
in
suicide
rates
in
rural
counties
is
alarming
miron
wasn't
involved
in
the
study
but
said
the
primary
factor
for
high
suicide
rates
was
unemployment
in
rural
communities
many
of
the
most
pernicious
health
and
social
problems
intersect
wu
said
lack
of
health
care
and
mental
health
facilities
in
rural
areas
further
compounds
the
problem
insurance
can
be
a
proxy
for
people's
access
to
mental
health
care
steelesmith
said
wu
agreed
lack
of
health
insurance
kills
people
he
said
more
insurance
including
the
expansion
of
medicaid
could
help
still
the
social
determinants
of
health
are
really
important
said
dr
david
brent
the
endowed
chair
in
suicide
studies
and
a
professor
of
psychiatry
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
you
can't
make
a
dent
in
these
kinds
of
public
health
problems
without
doing
something
to
deal
with
those
social
determinants
yes
you
can
provide
more
services
to
impoverished
people
but
there's
nothing
like
helping
people
get
out
of
poverty
and
since
the
study
only
examined
suicide
data
it's
likely
that
suicides
in
rural
america
from
to
present
have
increased
thanks
to
a
farming
bust
and
a
manufacturing
recession
