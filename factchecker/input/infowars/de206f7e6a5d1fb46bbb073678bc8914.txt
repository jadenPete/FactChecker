investigation
finds
trump
administration
hasn't
built
any
new
sections
of
the
wall
well
this
is
awkward
an
investigation
by
the
daily
caller
has
found
that
the
trump
administration
hasn't
built
any
new
sections
of
the
wall
on
the
u.s.
border
with
mexico
the
only
sections
of
the
wall
that
have
been
built
have
been
reinforcements
of
shoddily
constructed
barriers
erected
during
the
george
w.
bush
years
the
administration
said
that
it
considered
these
replacement
structures
to
be
a
priority
over
actually
building
a
new
linear
miles
wall
those
reinforcements
consist
of
foot
tall
structures
that
are
embedded
in
concrete
the
administration
says
it
expects
to
have
completed
miles
of
the
new
border
wall
by
the
end
of
with
the
help
of
the
billion
in
wall
funding
pulled
from
the
pentagon
however
when
asked
when
they
were
expected
to
break
ground
on
the
construction
of
this
new
linear
miles
wall
acting
customs
and
border
protection
cbp
commissioner
mark
morgan
couldn't
provide
an
answer
building
a
new
linear
miles
wall
takes
longer
because
of
the
land
acquisition
process
although
administration
officials
claim
that
this
process
has
been
shortened
trump
is
facing
increasing
criticism
from
within
his
own
camp
notably
ann
coulter
for
failing
to
deliver
on
his
election
promise
to
build
the
wall
however
his
supporters
insist
that
the
delay
is
purely
down
to
obstructionist
democrats
and
that
the
wall
will
get
built
if
trump
is
re-elected
