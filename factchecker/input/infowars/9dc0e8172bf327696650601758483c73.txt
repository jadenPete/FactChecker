a
university
in
china
has
installed
facial
recognition
cameras
in
classrooms
that
monitor
students
behavior
such
as
nodding
off
or
playing
with
their
cellphones
china
pharmaceutical
university
in
nanjing
east
china's
jiangsu
province
is
piloting
the
system
in
two
classrooms
and
eventually
plans
to
install
it
in
every
classroom
the
system
can
access
every
student's
personal
information
and
monitor
their
behavior
in
class
such
as
nodding
off
and
playing
with
their
mobile
phones
reports
global
times
the
cameras
can
also
record
truancy
whether
students
are
listening
or
not
how
often
they
look
up
and
down
and
whether
they
leave
early
students
complain
the
system
is
an
invasion
of
their
privacy
but
school
officials
insist
the
cameras
are
necessary
to
encourage
discipline
under
china's
orwellian
social
credit
system
all
such
systems
are
eventually
planned
to
be
centralized
and
linked
to
each
citizen's
individual
credit
score
resulting
in
rewards
and
punishments
for
good
and
bad
behavior
as
we
reported
last
month
the
chinese
government
bragged
about
preventing
million
discredited
entities
from
purchasing
plane
tickets
and
people
from
buying
high
speed
train
tickets
in
the
month
of
july
alone
the
recent
phenomenon
of
conservatives
and
dissidents
being
prevented
from
using
paid
services
and
having
their
bank
accounts
closed
for
their
political
opinions
is
a
chilling
reflection
of
how
a
similar
system
is
being
rolled
out
in
the
west
