why
a
prominent
economist
abandoned
his
support
for
carbon
taxes
activists
who
genuinely
believe
the
world
faces
catastrophe
should
give
serious
consideration
to
david
henderson's
reasons
for
thinking
a
carbon
tax
might
be
a
false
solution
david
r.
henderson
is
a
research
fellow
with
the
hoover
institution
and
was
a
professor
at
the
naval
postgraduate
school
in
monterey
california
who
taught
courses
on
energy
economics
he
originally
endorsed
the
standard
view
among
economists
that
if
some
physical
scientists
are
right
that
greenhouse
gas
emissions
will
lead
to
substantial
warming
and
if
the
government
must
do
something
then
the
best
policy
response
is
a
tax
on
carbon
however
as
henderson
explains
in
a
recent
article
he
has
since
changed
his
mind
and
no
longer
thinks
a
carbon
tax
is
a
slam
dunk
even
if
we
stipulate
the
basic
framework
of
the
market
failure
argument
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
academics
and
policy
wonks
should
be
agitating
for
a
carbon
tax
there
might
be
much
better
solutions
available
rather
than
having
the
government
penalize
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
the
present
post
i'll
review
henderson's
reasons
for
his
change
and
i'll
also
address
some
of
the
objections
that
his
critics
raised
against
his
essay
before
diving
into
his
more
substantive
points
let
me
relay
henderson's
discussion
of
the
odd
phrase
price
on
carbon
which
you
frequently
hear
in
these
debates
let's
first
dispose
of
the
idea
that
taxing
carbon
is
the
same
thing
as
pricing
carbon
carbon
is
already
priced
natural
gas
oil
and
coal
all
have
prices
and
their
prices
are
somewhat
related
to
the
amount
of
carbon
they
contain
to
be
sure
adding
a
tax
to
carbon
would
raise
the
prices
of
all
those
fuels
just
as
adding
a
tax
to
alcohol
would
make
your
tipple
more
expensive
but
just
as
setting
a
tax
on
alcohol
does
not
price
alcohol
setting
a
tax
on
carbon
does
not
price
carbon
in
my
more
cynical
moments
i
wonder
if
advocates
of
a
carbon
tax
sometimes
call
such
a
tax
a
price
to
mislead
people
into
thinking
that
a
carbon
tax
is
a
market
solution
rather
than
a
tax
solution
bold
added
henderson
here
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
besides
just
being
wrong
to
equate
a
carbon
tax
with
a
price
on
carbon
would
sound
ludicrous
in
the
context
of
any
other
tax
after
summarizing
the
textbook
case
for
using
a
pigovian
named
after
a.c.
pigou
tax
as
the
least-cost
decentralized
way
to
correct
the
negative
externality
of
human
carbon
dioxide
emissions
an
approach
that
is
endorsed
by
even
conservative
libertarian
republican
economists
such
as
greg
mankiw
george
shultz
and
john
cochrane
henderson
explains
why
he
now
has
serious
doubts
e
conomists
who
advocate
pigovian
taxes
take
as
given
that
the
most-efficient
way
to
forestall
global
warming
is
to
reduce
the
amount
of
carbon
used
but
what
if
their
assumption
is
incorrect
there
are
at
least
three
important
reasons
to
conclude
that
the
assumption
is
wrong
first
cow
farts
a
far
more
potent
greenhouse
gas
than
carbon
dioxide
is
methane
methane
warms
the
planet
much
more
quickly
than
carbon
dioxide
before
decaying
to
carbon
dioxide
to
be
sure
the
co
lasts
much
much
longer
than
methane
but
the
fact
of
methane's
huge
short-run
potency
surely
suggests
that
a
tax
on
carbon
may
not
be
the
cheapest
way
to
forestall
global
warming
second
one
important
technological
development
over
the
last
decade
has
been
geo-engineering
the
idea
here
is
to
change
other
things
in
the
atmosphere
that
are
easier
to
change
than
the
amount
of
carbon
used
is
such
a
technology
feasible
right
now
maybe
not
but
if
it
were
it
would
be
incredibly
cheap
myhrvold's
organization
intellectual
ventures
estimated
that
it
could
be
set
up
in
two
years
for
million
and
an
annual
operating
cost
of
about
million
the
third
low-cost
way
to
rein
in
global
warming
is
by
planting
trees
trees
absorb
and
store
co
emissions
you
could
call
the
tree-planting
strategy
geo-engineering
but
it
would
count
as
such
in
a
very
low-tech
form
according
to
a
july
article
in
the
guardian
planting
one
trillion
trees
would
be
much
cheaper
than
a
carbon
tax
and
much
more
effective
at
an
estimated
cost
of
cents
per
additional
tree
the
overall
cost
would
be
billion
that's
large
but
it's
a
one-time
cost
bold
added
to
summarize
the
specific
change
in
henderson's
thinking
is
that
he
has
come
to
realize
that
even
if
we
thought
the
government
should
do
something
about
climate
change
it's
not
obvious
that
the
correct
policy
is
to
induce
businesses
and
households
to
reduce
their
carbon
dioxide
emissions
that
mentality
is
usually
taken
for
granted
in
the
pigovian
framing
of
the
climate
change
debate
but
as
henderson
explains
there
are
several
reasons
he
now
thinks
that
perhaps
this
assumption
is
itself
wrong
to
repeat
even
if
one
stipulates
if
only
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
government
should
do
something
to
avert
the
climate
change
that
human
activity
will
cause
if
left
unchecked
there
might
be
more
sensible
policies
than
to
tackle
carbon
dioxide
emissions
directly
i
have
written
on
some
of
these
themes
here
at
ier
for
example
when
i
explained
geo-engineering
options
to
college
students
who
wanted
humanity
to
do
something
about
the
threat
of
climate
change
and
when
i
recently
used
the
new
tree-planting
study
to
illustrate
ronald
coase's
famous
critique
of
the
entire
pigovian
tax
framework
for
fixing
ostensible
market
failures
note
too
that
a
huge
advantage
of
planting
trees
is
that
they
are
a
geo-engineering
approach
that
has
few
of
the
downsides
of
more
radical
proposals
it
would
be
hard
for
critics
to
object
that
planting
trees
will
hurt
the
environment
in
some
other
perhaps
unpredictable
way
to
help
make
sense
of
henderson's
point
about
methane
here
is
a
quick
chemistry
refresher
carbon
dioxide
co
is
a
molecule
consisting
of
one
carbon
atom
and
two
oxygen
atoms
while
a
molecule
of
methane
ch
consists
of
one
carbon
atom
and
four
hydrogen
atoms
standard
estimates
conclude
that
a
ton
of
methane
is
eighty-four
times
as
potent
in
global
warming
potential
as
a
ton
of
carbon
dioxide
over
a
year
horizon
and
that
perhaps
one-fourth
of
humanity's
contribution
to
global
warming
to
date
has
come
from
methane
emissions
rather
than
restate
the
arguments
that
henderson
and
i
have
made
it
might
illuminate
the
issues
better
if
i
now
tackle
two
of
the
particular
objections
that
critics
raised
in
the
comments
section
of
the
popular
blog
econlog
where
henderson
posted
his
article
several
critics
objected
to
henderson's
claim
that
methane's
global
warming
potential
showed
the
limits
of
a
tax
on
carbon
dioxide
if
methane
contributes
more
to
global
warming
per
ton
than
carbon
dioxide
said
the
critics
then
let's
slap
a
big
fat
tax
on
methane
emissions
too
after
all
when
it
comes
to
saving
the
planet
why
would
we
let
big
cattle
off
the
hook
yet
these
critics
are
falling
into
a
familiar
trap
in
the
climate
change
policy
debate
they
are
assuming
that
political
solutions
are
costless
to
implement
but
in
reality
look
at
how
much
of
mankind's
attention
has
been
devoted
to
the
issue
of
taxing
carbon
during
the
last
twenty
years
suppose
a
carbon
tax
were
rammed
through
with
much
gnashing
of
teeth
and
then
the
technocratic
economists
had
to
inform
everybody
hey
folks
even
though
this
was
just
sold
to
you
as
the
market
solution
to
climate
change
this
by
itself
won't
cut
it
since
technically
it
applies
only
to
carbon
dioxide
from
certain
large
specified
emitters
we
need
a
methane
tax
too
that
would
entail
another
long
process
taking
years
of
political
fights
with
farmers
staging
protests
this
actually
happened
in
in
new
zealand
as
backlash
against
a
proposed
fart
tax
and
the
ceos
of
veggie
burger
companies
suddenly
becoming
very
concerned
about
the
environment
when
economists
and
other
policy
wonks
talk
about
carbon
taxes
at
a
theoretical
level
they
usually
are
using
it
as
shorthand
for
carbon
dioxide
and
then
add
as
an
afterthought
oh
and
we
should
include
other
greenhouse
gases
too
based
on
their
co
equivalent
but
in
practice
real-world
carbon
taxes
often
don't
explicitly
include
methane
and
other
greenhouse
gases
for
example
british
columbia
in
enacted
what
is
considered
the
textbook
example
of
a
carbon
tax
done
right
because
of
its
ostensible
refund
to
taxpayers
and
yet
famous
climate
academic
and
activist
david
suzuki
ten
years
later
was
urging
the
b.c.
government
to
apply
their
carbon
tax
to
methane
emissions
this
is
a
serious
issue
and
shows
the
limits
of
political
solutions
if
an
administration
tried
to
use
tax
legislation
that
was
explicitly
designed
to
apply
to
carbon
dioxide
content
and
then
broaden
it
to
include
methane
emissions
that
would
be
a
clear
overstep
of
authority
lawyers
for
farmers
and
natural
gas
companies
which
release
methane
through
leaks
would
be
able
to
tie
up
enforcement
of
such
a
tax
move
in
the
courts
arguing
quite
correctly
that
it
was
a
violation
of
chemistry
to
apply
a
tax
or
fee
on
carbon
dioxide
to
methane
emissions
an
interesting
example
of
the
problem
is
washington
state's
failed
carbon
tax
ballot
initiative
an
explanatory
statement
from
the
washington
state
voters
guide
says
the
fee
charged
would
be
based
on
the
amount
of
carbon
content
in
the
fossil
fuels
in
the
case
of
electricity
the
fee
would
be
based
on
the
carbon
content
of
the
fossil
fuels
used
to
generate
the
electricity
carbon
content
means
the
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
released
from
burning
or
oxidation
of
fossil
fuels
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
is
a
measure
used
to
compare
emissions
from
various
greenhouse
gases
based
on
their
global
warming
potential
so
the
carbon
content
of
a
fossil
fuel
is
a
measure
of
the
carbon
dioxide
and
other
greenhouse
gases
that
are
released
when
the
fossil
fuel
is
burned
or
otherwise
consumed
for
purposes
of
calculating
the
fee
the
department
of
ecology
is
responsible
for
determining
the
carbon
content
of
fossil
fuels
or
inherent
in
electricity
bold
added
so
this
seems
to
be
exactly
what
the
pigovian
doctor
ordered
right
the
carbon
fee
would
be
assessed
according
to
the
global
warming
potential
of
the
greenhouse
gas
in
question
ah
but
wait
even
this
bill
which
we
recall
failed
at
the
ballot
box
wouldn't
have
handled
henderson's
concerns
because
it
applies
only
to
fossil
fuel
emissions
so
even
if
the
government
could
plausibly
argue
that
methane
leaks
which
are
not
really
the
same
as
the
methane
contained
in
the
use
of
natural
gas
per
se
to
generate
electricity
should
be
included
when
assessing
the
carbon
tax
there's
no
way
washington
state
could
argue
that
the
voters
had
cow
farts
in
mind
had
they
approved
this
ballot
measure
since
about
a
third
of
human
methane
emissions
come
from
agriculture
that's
an
important
omission
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
but
i
think
what
henderson
is
driving
at
here
is
that
the
huge
push
to
tax
carbon
when
in
practice
it
means
taxing
carbon
dioxide
or
at
best
taxing
the
carbon
content
of
activities
involving
fossil
fuels
isn't
really
tackling
the
problem
correctly
to
see
that
this
is
a
serious
concern
here
are
the
opening
paragraphs
of
an
ft
article
from
may
scientists
have
sounded
the
alarm
after
levels
of
methane
in
the
atmosphere
reached
a
record
high
a
development
that
could
cause
an
unexpected
acceleration
in
global
warming
and
put
the
world
further
off
course
from
the
goals
of
the
paris
climate
deal
new
data
from
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
of
the
us
showed
that
concentrations
of
atmospheric
methane
surged
last
year
and
accounted
for
about
a
sixth
of
the
atmosphere's
capacity
to
trap
heat
methane's
unexpected
rise
is
a
major
challenge
to
the
paris
agreement
and
we
don't
know
why
it's
happening
said
euan
nisbet
earth
sciences
professor
at
royal
holloway
university
of
london
bold
added
if
climate
activists
genuinely
believe
that
the
fate
of
humanity
is
at
stake
it
is
surprising
how
much
faith
they
put
in
political
solutions
currently
even
if
all
nations
including
the
united
states
met
their
paris
pledges
the
standard
models
project
that
the
earth
would
still
experience
degrees
celsius
of
warming
blowing
way
past
the
c
let
alone
the
more
radical
c
ceiling
set
by
the
paris
agreement
especially
in
light
of
the
backlash
against
carbon
taxes
in
australia
france
and
even
canada
other
economists
should
consider
henderson's
change
of
heart
on
the
wisdom
or
lack
thereof
in
embracing
a
government
tax
as
a
solution
to
the
potential
problems
of
climate
change
another
objection
critics
raised
against
henderson's
essay
is
that
his
observation
about
trees
they
claimed
could
easily
be
incorporated
into
the
standard
pigovian
framework
if
planting
trees
were
an
effective
way
to
confer
massive
social
benefits
on
humanity
then
the
government
ought
to
subsidize
the
activity
why
we
could
even
use
the
proceeds
of
a
carbon
tax
to
fund
the
operation
there
are
several
problems
here
first
even
if
we
agreed
that
government
as
opposed
to
private
payments
for
tree-planting
made
sense
it
doesn't
at
all
follow
that
the
revenue
should
come
from
a
carbon
tax
in
general
raising
a
dollar
of
revenue
from
a
tax
on
carbon
content
hurts
the
economy
more
than
raising
a
dollar
from
taxing
labor
or
consumption
my
article
on
the
tax
interaction
effect
gives
the
economic
intuition
behind
this
point
so
if
the
government
needs
to
raise
x
billion
in
order
to
pay
people
to
plant
enough
trees
to
strike
a
blow
against
harmful
climate
change
then
there's
no
reason
to
raise
that
x
billion
through
a
carbon
tax
it
would
be
less
harmful
to
the
economy
to
raise
that
revenue
using
taxes
that
fall
on
a
broader
base
so
that
they
caused
fewer
distortions
to
economic
decisions
second
the
current
estimates
of
the
social
cost
of
carbon
upon
which
the
dollar
amount
of
carbon
taxes
is
calibrated
would
fly
out
the
window
if
people
began
a
massive
tree-planting
campaign
or
other
type
of
geo-engineering
program
if
we
took
the
standard
computer
models
and
plugged
in
a
scenario
where
humans
plant
enough
trees
and
or
engage
in
other
geo-engineering
techniques
to
bring
the
atmospheric
concentration
of
greenhouse
gases
back
to
levels
by
the
year
say
then
in
the
context
of
that
baseline
the
additional
emission
of
a
ton
of
co
today
would
have
a
negligible
impact
on
human
welfare
in
other
words
if
a
massive
tree-planting
campaign
or
other
geo-engineering
program
worked
out
the
way
henderson
hopes
then
in
the
new
equilibrium
when
everybody
reacted
to
the
new
scenario
the
computed
social
cost
of
carbon
would
be
close
to
ton
and
so
at
that
point
if
we
had
a
bunch
of
statutory
carbon
taxes
on
the
books
penalizing
emissions
at
the
rate
of
say
ton
or
higher
that
would
be
totally
unjustified
and
would
be
causing
massive
amounts
of
economic
damage
for
no
environmental
benefit
at
all
now
it's
true
a
sophisticated
defender
of
carbon
taxes
could
acknowledge
the
above
reasoning
and
nonetheless
argue
that
governments
would
matter-of-factly
revise
their
carbon
tax
magnitudes
downward
in
light
of
the
new
data
as
the
proliferation
of
tree-planting
programs
for
example
reduced
the
estimates
of
the
social
cost
of
carbon
yet
this
attitude
displays
the
height
of
na
vet
once
a
carbon
tax
is
installed
it
will
be
political
forces
from
government
officials
wanting
more
revenue
to
spend
to
motorists
and
businesses
wanting
a
lower
tax
burden
that
control
its
level
or
repeal
anybody
who
thinks
climate
scientists
will
control
the
dial
on
a
carbon
tax
should
ask
a
bunch
of
public
finance
economists
what
they
think
of
the
efficiency
of
the
current
tax
code
economist
david
r.
henderson
used
to
believe
that
if
the
government
were
going
to
do
something
about
climate
change
then
a
carbon
tax
seemed
to
be
the
obvious
policy
tool
to
use
yet
now
he
has
had
serious
doubts
this
isn't
because
he's
a
science
denier
but
rather
because
he's
thought
through
