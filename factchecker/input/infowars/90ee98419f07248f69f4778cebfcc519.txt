peter
schiff
us
has
weakest
manufacturing
economy
in
years
says
next
recession
going
to
be
one
of
the
worst
we've
seen
us
manufacturing
activity
contracted
in
august
according
to
the
latest
ism
data
the
number
for
august
came
in
at
any
number
under
signals
a
drop
in
manufacturing
this
was
the
first
contraction
in
three
years
according
to
reuters
this
was
the
first
time
the
index
has
dropped
below
since
august
it
was
the
fifth
straight
monthly
decline
and
as
peter
pointed
out
in
his
latest
podcast
this
was
the
lowest
ism
number
in
a
decade
this
is
the
weakest
manufacturing
economy
we've
had
in
years
basically
since
the
tail-end
of
the
great
recession
so
for
all
the
talk
from
donald
trump
about
how
great
this
economy
is
how
it's
the
greatest
economy
ever
it's
the
weakest
manufacturing
economy
since
the
great
recession
it's
weaker
than
it
was
pretty
much
at
any
point
during
the
obama
presidency
and
according
to
trump
obama
was
a
disaster
for
the
economy
he
was
a
disaster
for
manufacturing
well
maybe
he
was
right
but
trump
has
proved
to
be
an
even
bigger
disaster
than
obama
as
peter
said
the
only
thing
holding
up
the
us
economy
is
a
debt-financed
consumption
binge
by
american
consumers
and
the
us
government
basically
americans
are
driving
their
economy
with
money
they
don't
have
how
much
longer
can
people
keep
spending
borrowed
money
that
they
don't
have
and
they
can't
repay
and
how
much
longer
are
companies
going
to
keep
retaining
their
workers
when
a
recession
is
staring
them
in
the
face
peter
said
when
people
figure
out
what's
going
on
the
dollar
is
going
to
turn
in
fact
peter
said
the
dollar
really
isn't
as
strong
now
as
people
think
it's
just
stronger
than
the
other
fiat
currencies
out
there
gold
and
silver
have
been
surging
and
that
tells
us
something
about
the
dollar
for
all
the
hype
about
the
strong
greenback
the
dollar
index
has
increased
by
about
since
may
to
put
that
into
perspective
silver
is
up
by
almost
the
dollar
is
not
really
strong
it's
not
quite
as
weak
as
all
the
other
fiat
currencies
but
it
is
weak
gold
and
silver's
strength
is
basically
showing
you
just
how
weak
the
us
dollar
is
it's
just
that
that
weakness
is
not
being
reflected
in
the
foreign
exchange
markets
when
all
the
other
currencies
are
also
weak
but
the
days
where
the
dollar
is
the
least
weak
are
going
to
come
to
an
end
peter
said
the
only
thing
the
us
economy
has
going
for
it
right
now
is
the
federal
reserve
the
fed
built
a
phony
economic
recovery
on
the
foundation
of
a
wealth
effect
the
fed
deliberately
inflated
an
asset
bubble
so
that
people
will
think
they
were
richer
as
peter
put
it
the
fed
created
a
bubble
and
in
order
to
sustain
that
bubble
it
has
to
keep
force-feeding
more
air
into
it
the
problem
is
the
air
is
going
to
come
out
faster
than
they
can
put
it
in
peter
reiterated
a
recession
is
on
the
horizon
and
said
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
worst
we've
seen
because
a
recession
is
proportionate
to
the
artificial
boom
that
precedes
it
the
more
the
fed
has
to
interfere
with
the
free
market
the
more
the
fed
has
to
distort
the
free
market
by
artificially
lowering
interest
rates
the
more
mistakes
that
we
make
the
more
screwed
up
the
economy
gets
which
means
the
more
severe
the
bust
when
the
market
tries
to
correct
all
the
mistake
that
the
government
created
and
the
fed
created
peter
also
talked
about
the
trade
war
treasurys
central
bank
gold-buying
presidential
politics
and
about
what
gold
and
silver
are
telling
us
trump
warns
that
a
dem
election
will
crash
the
economy
president
trump
accurately
points
out
that
the
election
of
a
democrat
will
have
serious
negative
ramifications
to
the
market
