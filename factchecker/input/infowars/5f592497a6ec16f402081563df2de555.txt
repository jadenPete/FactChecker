fed
chair
jerome
powell
can
deny
reality
all
that
he
wants
but
that
isn't
going
to
change
anything
it's
happening
again
just
like
last
time
around
the
head
of
the
federal
reserve
is
telling
us
that
there
won't
be
a
recession
even
though
all
of
the
evidence
suggests
otherwise
just
before
the
recession
of
federal
reserve
chair
ben
bernanke
told
the
country
that
the
federal
reserve
is
not
currently
forecasting
a
recession
and
shortly
thereafter
we
plunged
into
the
worst
economic
downturn
since
the
great
depression
of
the
s
this
time
it
is
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
that
is
attempting
to
prop
things
up
by
making
positive
statements
that
are
not
backed
up
by
reality
speaking
to
a
group
at
the
university
of
zurich
powell
insisted
that
the
fed
is
not
at
all
anticipating
that
there
will
be
a
recession
meanwhile
things
are
literally
falling
apart
all
around
us
just
a
few
days
ago
i
put
together
a
list
of
data
points
that
clearly
indicate
that
a
recession
is
imminent
and
since
then
we
have
gotten
even
more
bad
news
for
instance
we
just
learned
that
fred's
will
be
filing
for
bankruptcy
and
closing
more
than
stores
at
this
point
u.s.
retailers
have
announced
the
closing
of
more
than
storesin
and
we
are
going
to
break
the
old
record
for
store
closings
in
a
single
year
by
so
much
that
the
term
retail
apocalypse
just
doesn't
seem
sufficient
to
describe
the
scale
of
what
we
are
witnessing
any
longer
make
no
mistake
you
are
a
target
in
the
surveillance
grid
also
constitutional
lawyer
norm
pattis
talks
about
how
today's
political
climate
is
curtailing
the
us
bill
of
rights
many
are
blaming
the
internet
for
this
colossal
wave
of
store
closings
but
is
the
internet
also
responsible
for
the
transportation
recession
that
has
already
started
according
to
zero
hedge
on
a
year
over
year
basis
heavy-duty
truck
orders
were
down
percent
in
june
and
percent
in
july
and
as
global
trade
continues
to
plummet
one
of
the
biggest
shipping
companies
in
the
entire
world
has
temporarily
suspended
one
of
their
main
routes
none
of
this
would
be
happening
if
economic
conditions
were
good
so
let's
stop
with
the
nonsense
fed
chair
jerome
powell
can
deny
reality
all
that
he
wants
but
that
isn't
going
to
change
anything
there
are
some
people
out
there
that
are
still
finding
solace
in
the
fact
that
the
official
unemployment
number
in
the
u.s.
is
still
so
low
at
just
percent
it
is
the
lowest
that
it
has
supposedly
been
in
decades
but
most
people
don't
realize
that
it
has
also
been
highly
manipulated
it
doesn't
include
tens
of
millions
of
people
that
are
working
part-time
for
economic
reasons
that
are
working
temporary
jobs
or
that
are
part
of
the
missing
labor
force
john
williams
of
shadowstats
com
compares
the
official
employment
numbers
to
what
they
would
look
like
if
honest
numbers
were
being
used
and
his
figures
tell
an
entirely
different
story
according
to
williams
the
real
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
u.s.
was
hovering
around
or
percent
prior
to
the
last
recession
and
then
it
shot
up
above
percent
and
has
stayed
there
ever
since
in
fact
the
alternate
unemployment
rate
on
shadowstats
com
is
currently
sitting
at
percent
so
that
would
suggest
that
we
have
never
even
come
close
to
recovering
from
the
last
recession
but
of
course
percent
sounds
so
much
better
than
percent
and
millions
of
americans
have
completely
bought
into
the
false
narrative
that
unemployment
has
been
steadily
falling
since
the
early
days
of
the
obama
administration
unfortunately
we
live
at
a
time
when
a
lot
of
people
don't
want
to
hear
the
truth
and
reality
is
defined
by
whoever
has
the
biggest
spin
machine
americans
are
more
deeply
divided
than
ever
and
there
is
very
little
agreement
on
the
direction
that
our
country
should
go
meanwhile
economic
conditions
are
deteriorating
a
little
bit
more
with
each
passing
day
and
it
has
become
exceedingly
clear
that
a
new
crisis
is
upon
us
and
this
new
crisis
has
arrived
at
a
time
when
our
debt
bubble
is
larger
than
it
has
ever
been
before
in
fact
one
expert
has
calculated
that
our
total
debt
burden
is
now
running
close
to
of
gdp
there
is
no
way
that
this
is
going
to
end
well
the
two
major
political
parties
will
continue
to
relentlessly
fight
with
one
another
and
it
will
mostly
be
about
really
silly
stuff
but
as
they
fight
our
nation
is
literally
steamrolling
into
oblivion
and
there
appears
to
be
very
little
hope
of
avoiding
our
fate
at
this
point
