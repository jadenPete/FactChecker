yves
mersch
has
cautioned
that
the
virtual
libra
currency
that
has
been
proposed
by
facebook
could
under
certain
circumstances
negatively
affect
the
bank's
ability
to
regulate
the
euro
and
the
single
market
depending
on
libra's
level
of
acceptance
and
on
the
referencing
of
the
euro
in
its
reserve
basket
it
could
reduce
the
ecb's
control
over
the

impair

mechanism

that
it's
more
important
than
ever
for
youtube
to
remain
an
open
platform
just

so-called

mersch
further
expressed
concern
over
how
the
new
currency
will
be
regulated
pointing
out
that
it
lacks
a
lender
of
last
resort
and
is
basically
controlled
by
a
group
of
shareholders
who
can't
be
regarded
as
repositories
of
public
trust
the
ecb
board
member
also
pointed
out
that
the
company
behind
the
planned
virtual
currency
facebook
is
currently
subject
to
scrutiny
by
legislative
bodies
both
in
the
us
and
in
the
eu
over
its
mishandling
of
users
personal
data
something
which
has
allegedly
posed
threat
to
western
democracies
the
ecb
official
said
that
he
hopes
european
users
won't
be
tempted
by
the
treacherous
promises
of
facebook's
siren
call
but
would
instead
stick
with
the
safety
and
soundness
of
established
