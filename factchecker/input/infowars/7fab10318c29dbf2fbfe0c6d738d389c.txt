former

official
bill
dudley's
recent
op-ed
calling
for
the
federal
reserve
to
implement
policies
that
will
damage
president
trump's
reelection
campaign
states
that
such
action
would
be
unprecedented
dudley
claims
the
federal
reserve
bases
its
policies
solely
on
an
objective
evaluation
of
economic
conditions
this
is
an
example
of
a
so-called
noble
lie
a
fiction
told
by
elites
to
the
masses
supposedly
for
the
people's
own
good
but
really
designed
to
maintain
popular
support
for
policies
that
benefit
the
elites
dudley's
noble
lie
is
designed
to
bolster
a
rapidly
and
deservedly
eroding
trust
in
the
federal
reserve
the
truth
is
the
federal
reserve
has
always
been
influenced
by
and
has
always
tried
to
influence
politics
president
george
h.w.
bush
and
other
members
of
his
administration
blamed
his
defeat
on
then-federal
reserve
chairman
alan
greenspan's
refusal
to
reduce
interest
rates
greenspan
was
more
cooperative
with
bush's
successor
bill
clinton
lloyd
bentsen
clinton's
first
treasury
secretary
wrote
in
his
autobiography
that
the
clinton
administration
and
the
federal
reserve
had
a
gentleman's
agreement
regarding
support
for
each
other's
policies
greenspan
also
boosted
president
george
w.
bush's
ownership
society
agenda
by
lowering
interest
rates
after
and
the
collapse
of
the
tech
bubble
thus
creating
a
housing
bubble
ben
bernanke
greenspan's
successor
facilitated
both
bush
w.
bush
and
barack
obama's
bailouts
stimulus
spending
and
massive
welfare-warfare
spending
with
record-low
interest
rates
and
quantitative
easing
speculation
that
the
fed
was
keeping
interest
rates
low
during
the
presidential
campaign
in
order
to
help
hillary
clinton
was
fueled
by
the
revelation
that
a
federal
reserve
governor
donated
to
clinton's
campaign
presidents
have
always
tried
to
influence
the
fed
usually
pushing
for
lower
rates
to
temporally
boost
the
economy
president
richard
nixon
was
recorded
joking
with
then-fed
chair
arthur
burns
about
fed
independence
president
lyndon
johnson
shoved
fed
chair
william
martin
against
a
wall
after
an
interest
rate
increase
johnson's
frustration
may
have
been
because
he
realized
that
the
success
or
failure
of
his
guns
and
butter
policies
was
largely
out
of
johnson's
control
the
success
or
failure
of
presidents
agendas
is
often
determined
by
a
secretive
central
bank's
manipulations
of
the
money
supply
no
wonder
presidents
spend
so
much
time
trying
to
influence
the
fed
the
fed's
history
of
influencing
and
being
influenced
by
presidents
is
one
more
reason
why
congress
should
pass
the
audit
the
fed
bill
auditing
the
fed
is
supported
by
almost
percent
of
americans
across
the
political
spectrum
including
such
leading
progressives
as
bernie
sanders
and
tulsi
gabbard
my
campaign
for
liberty
is
leading
a
major
push
to
get
a
majority
of
congress
members
to
cosponsor
audit
the
fed
in
order
to
pressure
house
and
senate
leadership
to
hold
a
vote
on
the
bill
the
american
people
have
had
enough
of
noble
lies
about
the
federal
reserve
it
is
time
for
truth
it
is
time
to
audit
the
fed
