the
other
side
of
the
sign
says
a
white
vote
for
trump
is
pure
racism
the
church's
african
american
pastor
michael
jordan
said
god
motivated
him
to
put
it
up
read
the
bible
and
look
in
the
white
house
he
told
reporters
if
they
call
me
a
racist
look
in
the
white
house
when
you
vote
for
donald
trump
you
are
supporting
institutionalised
racism
jordan
said
a
local
trump
supporter
named
daxton
kirk
complained
about
the
sign
saying
that
people
should
not
be
able
to
come
into
a
building
and
feel
like
you
are
hated
or
diversified
just
because
you
came
here
to
worship
the
lord
he
said
he
had
reached
out
to
local
officials
and
asked
them
to
take
action
on
the
sign
debra
messing
immediately
faced
a
slew
of
sarcastic
rebukes
that's
right
grandma
you
tell
those
black
citizens
what's
best
for
them
and
order
them
around
for
their
own
good
one
user
wrote
sarcastically

me
again
which
president
has
the
lowest
african
american
unemployment
rate
and

august
mccormack
earlier
floated
the
same
idea
calling
on
the
magazine
to
report
on
everyone
attending
this
event
so
the
rest
of
us
can
be
clear
about
who
we
don't
wanna
work
with
the
debauchery
inherent
in
a
godless
ego-driven
society
like
hollywood
and
the
degenrerative
culture
pushed
by
popular
media
are
purely
responsible
for
the
collapse
of
american
culture
