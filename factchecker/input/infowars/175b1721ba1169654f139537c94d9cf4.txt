trick
illegals
into

a
hilarious
video
circulating
on
social
media
shows
the
moment
a
group
of
illegal
aliens
jumped
into
the
back
of
a
pick-up
truck
driven
by
people
they
believe
want
to
help
transport
them
further
into
the
us
unfortunately
for
them
the
opposite
turns
out
to
be
true
as
the
men
driving
the
pick-up
truck
have
a
uniformed
customs
and
border
protection
agent
hiding
in
the
backseat
the
short
video
ends
with
the
people

the
date

was
shot
is
unclear
as

intensifies
it's
no
surprise
agents
are
having
to
devise
creative
methods
such
as
this
to
capture
and
process
illegals
who
would
rather
remain
undetected
