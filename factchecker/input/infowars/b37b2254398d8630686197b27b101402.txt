percent
of
americans
believe
a
recession
is
coming
but
consumers
continue
to
pile
up
debt
at
a
frightening
pace
in
life
all
decisions
have
consequences
and
we
are
going
to
pay
an
extraordinarily
high
price
for
our
exceedingly
foolish
decisions
we
haven't
seen
survey
results
like
this
since
just
before
the
last
recession
right
now
percent
of
americans
believe
that
a
recession
is
very
or
somewhat
likely
in
the
next
year
and
the
reason
why
that
figure
is
so
high
is
because
there
is
already
a
tremendous
amount
of
evidence
that
the
economy
is
slowing
down
all
around
us
as
i
have
been
documenting
repeatedly
u.s.
economic
performance
has
not
been
this
dismal
since
and
and
the
slowdown
seems
to
be
gaining
pace
as
we
move
toward
the
end
of
so
it
really
shouldn't
be
a
surprise
that
a
solid
majority
of
the
country
thinks
that
the
next
recession
will
officially
begin
very
soon
the
following
comes
from
abc
news
but
at
the
same
time
u.s.
consumers
continue
to
pile
up
more
debt
at
a
frightening
pace
according
to
nbc
news
total
revolving
credit
shot
up
at
an
annual
pace
during
the
month
of
july
if
a
severe
economic
downturn
really
is
coming
the
smart
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
out
of
credit
card
debt
paul
joseph
watson
sheds
light
on
the
growing
epidemic
responsible
for
taking
so
many
lives
but
these
days
americans
have
been
trained
to
be
very
short-term
thinkers
and
when
things
start
to
get
tight
it
is
really
easy
to
put
expenses
on
a
credit
card
and
worry
about
them
later
this
is
something
that
i
did
when
i
was
a
much
younger
man
and
it
is
something
that
millions
of
american
families
all
over
the
nation
are
doing
right
now
when
the
money
simply
isn't
there
it
is
just
so
tempting
to
whip
out
a
credit
card
but
credit
card
debt
is
one
of
the
most
insidious
forms
of
debt
because
of
the
high
interest
rates
most
credit
card
companies
charge
and
at
this
moment
credit
card
companies
are
jacking
up
rates
to
a
degree
that
we
haven't
seen
in
many
years
unfortunately
the
more
debt
that
you
accumulate
the
less
likely
it
becomes
that
you
will
ever
start
building
up
substantial
wealth
of
your
own
today
tens
of
millions
of
americans
are
deep
in
debt
and
are
working
exceedingly
hard
to
make
other
people
rich
and
this
is
one
of
the
biggest
reasons
why
well
over
half
the
nation
is
currently
living
in
asset
poverty
in
other
words
most
americans
are
living
right
on
the
edge
financially
and
that
is
a
very
dangerous
place
to
be
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
term
asset
poverty
the
following
is
a
pretty
good
definition
when
you
really
don't
have
any
real
wealth
of
your
own
you
are
essentially
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
and
a
single
major
setback
can
be
absolutely
disastrous
in
america
today
financial
difficulties
are
one
of
the
biggest
reasons
why
so
many
of
us
are
completely
stressed
out
and
the
next
recession
hasn't
even
officially
begun
yet
but
with
each
day
we
continue
to
get
more
numbers
that
tell
us
that
big
trouble
is
on
the
way
for
example
we
just
learned
that
the
u.s.
lost
trucking
jobs
last
month
and
of
course
trucking
companies
continue
to
go
bankrupt
at
a
staggering
pace
according
to
business
insider
more
than
trucking
companies
have
already
gone
bankrupt
so
far
this
year
sometimes
people
think
that
i
exaggerate
when
i
warn
people
about
what
is
coming
but
the
truth
is
that
i
am
not
exaggerating
at
all
if
anything
i
feel
frustrated
that
i
am
not
able
to
effectively
communicate
how
bad
it
will
actually
be
when
things
start
to
get
really
crazy
as
a
nation
we
have
been
making
incredibly
bad
decisions
for
decades
and
we
have
been
running
in
the
exact
opposite
direction
of
where
we
should
be
headed
as
fast
as
we
can
in
life
all
decisions
have
consequences
and
we
are
going
to
pay
an
extraordinarily
high
price
for
our
exceedingly
foolish
decisions
for
the
moment
things
are
relatively
quiet
but
that
quietness
will
not
last
for
much
longer
