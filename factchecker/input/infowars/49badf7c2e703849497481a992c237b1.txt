speaking
to

free

a
year-old
protester
named
james
said
his
group
had
decided
to
leave
the
airport
because
they
felt
vulnerable
in
the
evening
it's
dangerous
especially
at
the
airport
it's
just
a
small
island
police
can
come
from
the
airport
and
tung
chung
so
it's
two-sided
they
can
attack
from
two
sides
so
it's
hard
to
defend
yourself
