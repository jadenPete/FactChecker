in
sioux
falls

at
the

to
sddp

reports
the

is
also
canceling
a
black

no

related
to
the

financial
situation
have
taken
place
hawks
said
the
party's
cash
supply
reportedly
dwindled
to
just
by
the
end
of
july
down
from
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
and
a
meager
at
the
start
of
the
year
hawks
blamed
extreme
mismanagement
and
lack
of
oversight
for
the
party's
lack
of
funds
distancing
herself
from
shouldering
blame
for
the
shocking
debacle
chairwoman
hawks
is
doing
her
best
to
try
to
shift
the
blame
for
her
party's
finances
and
misreporting
to
the
federal
elections
commission
but
maybe
should
have
spoken
to
her
own
leadership
team
first
said
south
dakota
republican
party
chair
dan
lederman
the
sddp
was
found
to
have
grossly
misreported
its
financials
to
the
federal
elections
commission
indicating
that
the
party
likely
violated
fundraising
regulations
according
to
the
argus
leader
the
office
closure
announcement
comes
on
the
heels
of
a
draft
audit
by
the
federal
elections
commission
revealing
the
party
understated
disbursements
by
million
receive
impermissible
contributions
totaling
nearly
and
failed
to
disclose
debts
and
obligations
to
vendors
totaling
nearly
during
the
election
cycle
hawks
claims
she
is
dedicated
to
rejuvenating
the
sddp
and
correcting
its
trajectory
moving
forward
our
current
financial
situation
is
really
unfortunate
and
truly
very
unexpected
to
me
and
to
stacey
burnette
our
new
executive
director
hawks
said
we
both
kind
of
stumbled
into
this
and
discovered
some
things
that
we
didn't
realize
were
going
on
so
now
we're
cleaning
it
up
the
fec
fcc
want
to
meddle
in
elections
by
regulating
the
speech
of
conservative
voices

the
