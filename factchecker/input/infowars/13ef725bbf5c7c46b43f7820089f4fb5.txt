fed
protects
politicians
from
consequences
of
bad
economic
decision-making
peter
schiff
says
fed
makes
life
easy
for
elected
leaders
the
federal
reserve
makes
life
easier
for
politicians
by
pursuing
monetary
policies
that
shield
them
from
the
consequences
of
bad
economic
decision-making
by
keeping
interest
rates
low
and
printing
money
the
fed
hides
the
nefarious
impact
of
government
spending
trade
wars
and
other
bad
policies
peter
schiff
talked
about
this
in
a
recent
podcast
in
an
op-ed
by
former
fed
member
bill
dudley
said
that
the
fed
should
not
be
enabling
trump's
bad
trade
policy
by
cutting
rates
dudley
said
the
president
should
have
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
bad
policy
peter
called
dudley
a
hypocrite
what
does
he
think
the
fed
has
been
doing
including
what
was
the
fed
doing
when
dudley
was
a
member
that's
all
the
fed
has
been
doing
is
trying
to
take
the
sting
out
of
bad
policy
i
mean
number
one
is
the
monetization
of
debt
it
is
buying
up
of
us
government
bonds
to
enable
larger
deficits
than
the
private
sector
could
finance
and
also
keeping
interest
rates
artificially
low
so
the
government
could
keep
accumulating
more
and
more
debt
ironically
the
fed
recently
began
buying
us
treasurys
again
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
peter
reiterated
that
fed
monetary
policy
is
enabling
bad
government
fiscal
policy
it
has
insulated
the
economy
from
the
pain
that
should
have
immediately
resulted
which
are
higher
interest
rates
if
the
government
wants
to
run
bigger
deficits
it's
going
to
crowd
out
private
sector
investment
it's
going
to
force
up
interest
rates
which
means
mortgage
rates
and
other
rates
and
the
consumers
aren't
going
to
like
it
and
maybe
they
are
going
to
vote
out
the
incumbents
so
what
the
federal
reserve
has
been
doing
and
has
pretty
much
been
standard
operating
procedure
since
alan
greenspan
is
they
are
enabling
bad
policy
fiscal
policy
and
now
bad
trade
policy
but
they're
enabling
it
by
keeping
interest
rates
artificially
low
and
not
allowing
rates
to
rise
as
peter
noted
if
rates
rose
due
to
deficit
spending
there
might
be
some
political
pressure
to
cut
spending
but
with
the
fed
intervening
and
monetizing
the
debt
americans
don't
feel
the
pain
instead
the
federal
reserve
makes
it
easy
for
the
politicians
because
they
don't
have
to
make
any
of
the
hard
political
choices
because
they're
keeping
rates
artificially
low
keep
in
mind
the
central
bank
kept
interest
rates
at
zero
for
nearly
the
entirety
of
obama's
presidency
peter
said
the
fed
shouldn't
be
enabling
bad
policy
from
any
administration

the
fed
should
simply
be
concerned
about
the
purchasing
power
of
the
currency
they
should
be
looking
for
price
stability
at
a
minimum
which
is
what
the
fed
was
created
to
do
the
inflation
rates
that
we
already
have
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
are
already
too
high
the
fed
should
not
be
working
in
conjunction
with
the
white
house
to
make
things
easier
to
make
the
economy
appear
better
so
that
whoever's
the
incumbent
can
get
reelected
that's
been
the
cozy
relationship
they
basically
try
to
reelect
any
incumbent
regardless
of
party
so
it's
not
that
the
fed
has
been
partisan
they
have
done
bad
things
for
republicans
when
bush
was
in
charge
and
they
did
bad
things
when
obama
was
in
charge
they
did
bad
things
when
clinton
was
in
charge
the
fed
has
been
helping
every
president
regardless
of
party
by
keeping
interest
rates
too
low
and
by
printing
too
much
money
peter
recorded
this
podcast
last
friday
as
hurricane
dorian
was
barreling
toward
florida
he
took
the
opportunity
to
develop
an
analogy
saying
that
the
coming
economic
hurricane
is
going
to
be
a
category
five
peter
started
off
the
podcast
talking
about
the
silliness
of
those
who
claim
the
damage
from
a
hurricane
is
good
for
gdp
this
is
just
another
version
of
the
broken
window
fallacy
you
have
to
look
at
the
unforeseen
consequences
which
means
that
any
resources
that
are
going
to
be
devoted
to
rebuilding
whatever
the
hurricane
destroys
those
resources
are
now
not
available
to
do
something
else
so
we
have
to
go
without
something
else
that
we
would
have
had
in
addition
to
the
stuff
that
got
destroyed
now
all
we
have
to
do
is
rebuild
what
we
lost
and
we're
no
better
off
right
peter
went
on
to
talk
about
the
markets
noting
that
august
was
a
pretty
stormy
month
he
said
most
investors
probably
want
to
forget
last
month
unless
they
were
invested
in
silver
and
gold
every
stock
index
was
down
on
the
month
bond
yields
tanked
with
the
year
treasury
hitting
a
record
low
yield
there
was
significant
volatility
in
the
currency
markets
my
feeling
is
that
september
is
going
to
be
even
more
volatile
i
think
we're
going
to
have
even
bigger
moves
and
more
surprises
in
the
month
of
september
so
people
really
need
to
prepare
peter
said
historically
september
hasn't
been
a
friendly
month
to
the
stock
market
peter
also
broke
down
the
recent
gdp
revisions
and
consumer
spending
numbers
the
fed
is
at
war
with
america
mike
adams
exposes
the
agenda
of
the
private
fed
as
a
war
against
the
prosperity
of
americans
that
simply
want
to
make
america
great
