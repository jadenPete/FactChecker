the
public
goods
excuse
for
big
government
the
problem
with
pork
barrel
projects
one
of
the
key
defenses
of
the
necessity
of
the
state
is
that
the
market
left
to
its
own
devices
underprovides
public
goods
therefore
the
thinking
goes
state
intervention
can
yield
a
better
outcome
than
the
market
by
increasing
the
supplies
of
public
goods
to
their
optimum
levels
the
public
goods
argument
for
the
state
fails
both
because
it
fails
to
prove
that
any
given
unit
of
a
nonrivalrous
and
nonexcludable
output
is
actually
desired
on
the
marketplace
and
because
it
fails
to
prove
that
the
gains
from
state
provision
of
these
units
of
goods
justify
the
opportunity
costs
of
reduced
provision
of
other
goods
what
are
public
goods
in
the
neoclassical
economics
literature
public
goods
are
defined
as
goods
that
are
nonrivalrous
and
nonexcludable
nonrivalrous
means
one
person's
enjoyment
of
a
good
does
not
diminish
another's
enjoyment
of
that
good
if
smith
see
a
fireworks
display
in
the
distance
and
enjoys
it
this
in
no
way
hampers
the
enjoyment
of
other
people
watching
the
display
however
if
smith
eats
a
slice
of
pizza
this
would
preclude
anyone
else
from
eating
that
slice
so
pizza
is
rivalrous
nonexcludable
means
people
cannot
be
prevented
from
enjoying
the
good
if
jones
shoots
fireworks
high
into
the
sky
in
his
backyard
to
entertain
his
family
he
cannot
prevent
the
entire
neighborhood
from
seeing
the
fireworks
display
and
also
enjoying
it
however
an
amusement
park
can
turn
people
away
at
the
gate
so
access
to
its
rollercoasters
is
excludable
from
these
two
attributes
the
argument
goes
the
issue
of
free-riders
and
suboptimal
provision
arises
when
a
public
good
is
created
no
one
can
stop
people
from
using
it
for
free
since
it's
non-excludable
and
many
people
will
try
to
free-ride
as
a
result
public
goods
cannot
be
funded
at
all
or
at
least
not
in
sufficient
quantity
voluntarily
for
profit
like
other
goods
on
the
market
and
have
to
be
paid
for
through
taxation
are
public
goods
actually
goods
an
enormous
but
difficult
to
see
issue
with
public
goods
is
that
they
are
assumed
to
be
good
they
are
defined
to
be
good
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
discussion
and
by
their
very
name
public
goods
instead
of
begging
the
question
of
the
benefits
of
public
goods
the
phrase
public
goods
should
be
replaced
with
nonexcludable
and
nonrivalrous
outputs
and
then
the
beneficial
or
harmful
nature
of
the
outputs
can
be
scrutinized
rather
than
assumed
from
the
start
neoclassical
economics
presents
fireworks
lighthouses
and
national
defense
as
standard
examples
of
public
goods
but
fireworks
displays
are
public
bads
to
people
trying
to
sleep
lighthouses
are
public
bads
to
owners
of
coastal
properties
whose
views
of
the
sea
are
obscured
by
new
lighthouses
and
national
defense
is
a
public
bad
to
pacifists
furthermore
national
defense
may
begin
as
a
purely
defensive
measure
but
once
the
tanks
and
missiles
are
built
they
always
carry
the
risk
of
being
turned
to
deadly
offensive
purposes
against
domestic
and
foreign
civilians
in
light
of
this
very
real
risk
that
the
public
good
of
national
defense
carries
even
many
non-pacifists
within
the
nation
and
abroad
may
see
a
standing
state
army
or
at
least
many
marginal
units
of
it
as
a
public
bad
no
nonrivalrous
and
nonexcludable
output
can
be
assumed
from
the
outset
to
be
beneficial
to
anyone
let
alone
everyone
moreover
given
the
incoherence
of
interpersonal
comparisons
of
utility
it's
this
latter
standard
which
must
be
met
to
justify
state
public
goods
provision
as
socially
beneficial
economists
can
never
claim
that
a
given
public
good
is
socially
beneficial
unless
it's
perceived
to
be
beneficial
by
everyone
because
the
benefits
incurred
in
some
subjective
minds
cannot
be
added
or
subtracted
from
the
harms
incurred
in
other
subjective
minds
demonstrated
preferencethe
only
way
to
know
that
a
particular
unit
of
something
at
a
particular
time
is
indeed
a
good
in
the
mind
of
a
particular
individual
is
through
an
act
of
demonstrated
preference
by
the
individual
if
smith
voluntarily
purchases
x
then
we
know
that
he
considers
x
a
good
and
that
he
values
it
more
than
the
amount
of
money
he
paid
for
it
a
crucial
issue
for
public
goods
is
that
because
by
definition
people
do
not
voluntarily
pay
for
public
goods
or
at
least
for
enough
units
of
them
we
must
simply
take
economists
word
that
consumers
actually
want
these
additional
units
despite
the
fact
that
they
refuse
to
voluntarily
pay
for
them
this
is
akin
to
smith
telling
jones
that
there
is
an
invisible
assassin
in
the
room
that
only
smith
can
hear
who
wants
jones
to
give
smith
his
wallet
or
else
the
assassin
will
shoot
jones
economists
can
never
identify
any
particular
units
of
any
particular
output
as
a
public
good
through
demonstrated
preference
one
objection
is
that
in
lieu
of
demonstrated
preference
economists
may
attempt
to
determine
the
benefits
of
public
goods
by
surveying
individuals
asking
how
much
they
hypothetically
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
marginal
units
of
a
service
in
the
future
however
this
approach
is
riddled
with
insolvable
problems
and
is
no
substitute
for
actual
demonstrated
preference
additionally
in
practice
the
state
doesn't
actually
survey
people
and
dispassionately
follow
the
survey
results
to
determine
the
quantity
of
military
defense
sanitation
or
other
public
goods
to
provide
opportunity
costsleaving
all
of
the
aforementioned
problems
behind
even
if
we
assume
that
everyone
unanimously
values
a
particular
nonrivalrous
and
nonexcludable
output
as
a
good
and
prefers
its
presence
to
its
absence
that
still
fails
to
prove
that
state
provision
of
the
public
good
is
beneficial
this
is
because
in
order
for
the
state
to
fund
the
public
good
to
bring
its
level
of
provision
up
to
the
optimal
level
the
state
must
first
tax
another
portion
of
the
economy
thereby
reducing
provision
of
other
goods
and
services
below
the
optimal
level
the
market
had
arrived
upon
for
those
goods
for
example
in
order
to
spend
a
million
dollars
on
lighthouses
the
state
must
first
tax
a
million
dollars
that
people
were
going
to
spend
on
pumpkin
pies
housing
snowglobes
veterinary
services
etc
since
these
people
when
they
were
left
to
spend
their
money
the
way
they
wished
chose
to
spend
it
on
the
aforementioned
bundle
of
goods
rather
than
on
lighthouses
that
means
they
ex
ante
preferred
the
former
to
the
latter
and
state
redistribution
has
made
them
worse
off
one
may
object
that
although
this
subset
of
society
the
taxpayers
suffer
a
loss
the
loss
they
suffer
is
less
than
the
gain
that
sailors
and
society
as
a
whole
will
enjoy
once
the
lighthouses
are
built
this
objection
fails
on
the
grounds
of
the
incoherence
of
interpersonal
comparisons
of
utility
furthermore
there
is
also
no
demonstrated
preference
on
behalf
of
the
sailors
who
refused
to
voluntarily
fund
the
lighthouse
either
so
it
cannot
be
known
that
they
value
any
given
lighthouse
as
a
good
perhaps
because
they
don't
plan
to
sail
near
it
or
have
recently
acquired
gps
technology
in
other
words
as
hans-herman
hoppe
explains
since
money
or
other
resources
must
be
withdrawn
from
possible
alternative
uses
to
finance
the
supposedly
desirable
public
goods
the
only
relevant
and
appropriate
question
is
whether
or
not
these
alternative
uses
to
which
the
money
could
be
put
that
is
the
private
goods
which
could
have
been
acquired
but
now
cannot
be
bought
because
the
money
is
being
spent
on
public
goods
instead
are
more
valuable
more
urgent
than
the
public
goods
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
perfectly
clear
in
terms
of
consumer
evaluations
however
high
its
absolute
level
might
be
the
value
of
the
public
goods
is
relatively
lower
than
that
of
the
competing
private
goods
because
if
one
had
left
the
choice
to
the
consumers
and
had
not
forced
one
alternative
upon
them
they
evidently
would
have
preferred
spending
their
money
differently
otherwise
no
force
would
have
been
necessary
opportunity
cost
in
public
goods
monopoly
and
positive
externalitiesthis
same
opportunity
cost
argument
against
using
government
intervention
to
provide
increased
supplies
of
public
goods
also
applies
to
state
plans
to
increase
the
output
of
alleged
natural
monopolies
and
increase
the
production
of
goods
that
provide
positive
externalities
in
order
for
output
to
be
increased
in
one
area
resources
must
be
removed
from
other
areas
then
the
impossible
burden
of
proof
falls
to
the
state
to
justify
that
the
benefits
of
increased
production
in
one
area
outweigh
the
harms
of
decreased
production
in
other
areas
but
when
units
of
a
good
are
not
funded
voluntarily
and
there
is
no
demonstrated
preference
on
the
part
of
consumers
it's
impossible
to
prove
that
there
are
benefits
at
all
let
alone
that
they
outweigh
the
opportunity
costs
public
goods
theory
assumes
certain
units
of
outputs
to
be
goods
despite
a
lack
of
demonstrated
preference
for
those
units
and
assumes
those
units
to
be
socially
preferential
to
their
opportunity
costs
despite
the
fact
that
consumers
demonstrate
their
preference
for
the
opportunity
costs
over
the
units
of
the
alleged
public
good
only
if
one
were
willing
to
interpret
someone's
no
as
really
meaning
yes

nonbuying
of
something
as
meaning
that
it
is

over

which

does
