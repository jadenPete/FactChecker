reports
interim
police
chief
steve
outlaw
said
at
a
news
conference
you
can't
help
but
wonder
whether

a
factor
in
the

found
no
evidence
of
any
connections

had
not
determined
a
motive
for
the
spontaneous

in
july
in
a
quote
that
highlights
the
need
for
more
armed
citizens
chief
outlaw
said
some
of
the
employees
as
he
was
leaving
armed
themselves
with
whatever
they
could
and
actually
held
him
at
bay
that
delayed
his
escape
which
was
very
good
for
us
but
he
got
up
and
started
to
leave
again
and
at
some
point
the
officer
engaged
and
took
him
into
custody
he
continued
while
the
left
focuses
on
taking
away

america
this
tragedy
is
more
proof
that
criminals
will
carry
out
their
heinous
acts
by
any
means
