overlooked
asteroid
that
exploded
over
caribbean
car-sized
rock
deemed
too
small
to
be
a
threat
the
agency
said
that
it
has
detected
and
flagged
bigger
asteroids
than
the
one
in
question
it
has
also
confirmed
that
it
was
sure
the
space
rock
would
do
no
harm
as
it
wouldn't
survive
entry
into
the
atmosphere
nasa
has
detected
but
not
taken
measures
against
an
asteroid
that
entered
the
earth's
atmosphere
and
exploded
over
the
caribbean
the
space
agency
admitted
in
a
statement
that
the
rock
measuring
about
meters
in
size
and
designated
mo
was
first
spotted
when
it
was
about
kilometers
from
earth
just
before
it
hit
the
atmosphere
this
was
roughly
the
equivalent
of
spotting
something
the
size
of
a
gnat
from
a
distance
of
miles
kilometres
nasa
said
it
was
still
flagged
and
reported
to
the
nasa-funded
minor
planet
centre
which
deals
with
data
about
the
asteroids
and
comets
but
was
deemed
too
small
to
cause
any
damage
to
earthlings
the
universal
human
spirit
is
becoming
overwhelmed
by
the
immense
presence
of
evil
in
the
world
the
fireball
breached
the
atmosphere
over
the
caribbean
in
the
evening
of
june
and
burned
up
there
generating
energy
equivalent
to
roughly
to
thousand
tons
of
tnt
according
to
astronomers
nasa
then
analyzed
the
explosion
and
traced
it
back
to
mo
asteroids
this
size
are
far
smaller
than
what
we're
tasked
to
track

object
studies
they're
so
small
they
would
not
survive
passing
through
our
atmosphere
to
cause
damage
to
earth's
surface
but
this
event
shows
how
capable
our
search
programs
are
even
for
objects
of
such
small
sizes
nasa
has
recently
warned
that
a
potentially
hazardous
asteroid
bigger
than
the
eiffel
tower
would
hurtle
past
earth
on
friday
and
in
july
a
mammoth
space
rock
dubbed
ok
buzzed
by
at
an
uncomfortably
close
proximity
with
scientists
saying
collision
with
earth
would
be
tantamount
to
the
explosion
of
a
very
large
nuclear
weapon
