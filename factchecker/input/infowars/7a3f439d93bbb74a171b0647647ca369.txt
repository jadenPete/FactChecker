the
incident
to

though
it's
not
clear
who
orchestrated
and
ordered

it's
certainly
possible
that
the

keep
quiet

drawn
the
ire

in
support
of
the

lai
has
been
denounced
as
a
traitor
by
the

and
it's
certainly
possible
that
the

was
intended

an
act
of
intimidation
it's
also
possible
that
government-aligned
thugs
staged
the
attack
as
a
false

intends
to
blame

may
have
staged

on

lam
said
during
a
press
conference
that
beijing
understands
respects
and
supports
her

decision
to
pull
the
extradition
bill
in
an

to
help
her
city
move
forward
from
months
of
unrest
lam
dodged
questions
about
why
it
took
her
so
long
to
pull
the
bill
saying
it's
not
exactly
correct
to
describe
her
decision
as
a
change
of
mind
throughout
the
whole
process
the
central
people's
government
took
the
position
that
they
understood
why
we
have
to
do
it
they
respect
my
view
and
they
support
me
all
the
way
said
lam
according
to

protesters
have
insisted
that
the
government
must
meet
all
five
of
their
demands
the
four
others
are

riot
to
describe

release

announced
other
measures
including
opening
a
platform
for
dialogue
to
address

deep-rooted
concerns
about

insist
that
this
is

little
too
late
