when

the

reported
one
antifa

as
saying
they
are
fascists
how
else
are
you
going
to
get
them
to
shut
up
the

added
the

also
noted
that
among
the

were
individuals

words

as
for
the
straight
pride
event
organizers
took
serious
issue
with
being
called
white
supremacists
in
a
statement
released
to
the
media
the
super
happy
fun
america
group
categorically
denied
any
connections
to
racist
groups
not
sure
which
parade
and
ceremony
she
watched
over
the
weekend
but
of
the
speakers
on
our
stage
five
were
african-american
four
were
women
and
three
were
african-american
women
this
was
not
intentional
on
our
behalf
they
reached
out
to
us
in
support
of
our
movement
it
happened
organically
if
you
remove
the
three
main
organizers
from
the
lineup
the
majority
of
speakers
were
african-american
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
and
ayanna
pressley
also
shared
a
link
to
a
bail
fundraiser
set
up
in
advance
of
the
parade
which
gives
people
the
impression
that
they
condone
illegal
behavior
this
is
not
a
good
example
for
elected
officials
to
set
and
contributes
to
dangers
associated
with
free-speech
and
activism
in
general
the
only
connections
to
racism
are
in
the
deluded
minds
of
protesters
who
all
repeat
the
same
mantra
against
those
whom
they
disagree
with
racist
fascist
nazi
etc
are
what
detractors
fall
back
on
when
their
arguments
are
met
with
logical
and
rational
push-back
they
cannot
win
on
an
intellectual
level
so
they
resort
to
name-calling
those
same
people
must
have
missed
the
israeli
flags
and
african-american
supporters
in
our
group
aoc's
office
has
not
responded
to
queries
over
why
she
labeled
the
group
as
white
supremacists
or
as
to
why
she
encouraged
support
for
violent
protesters
