reached
national
television
with
a
new
viceland
documentary
called
the
devil
you
know
focusing
on
algarad's
case
however
the
case
never
made
it
to
trial
as
algarad
committed
suicide
in
jail
in
upon
learning
about
the
suicide
flowers
said
pazuzu
had
always
told
me
he
would
kill
himself
if
he
ended
up
in
jail
and
couldn't
do
his
rituals
each
month
on
the
dark
moon
he
spoke
about
it
in
such
detail
all
the
different
ways
he
would
do
it
pazuzu
filed
his
teeth
down
to
points
with
a
dremel
tool
he
told
me
he
would
gnaw
his
finger
to
the
bone
then
stab
an
artery
with
it
flowers
told
dailymail
sure
enough
algarad's
autopsy
shows
he
suffered
a
puncture
wound
over
an
artery
on
his
left
forearm
and
died
from
blood
loss
flowers
explained
algarad's
desire
to
become
a
demonic
entity
saying
i
think
he
wanted
to
be
a
demon
and
he
came
as
close
to
being
one
as
any
human
being
could
only
when
he
met
algarad
flowers
simply
thought
the
warped
taboo
behavior
he
witnessed
was
normal
rebellious
conduct
sheriff's
officers
who
entered
algarad's
home
in
had
to
fight
through
piles
of
garbage
and
animal
and
human
waste
but
flowers
claims
the
house
wasn't
always
in
such
a
state
see
bodycam
footage
of
the
house
in
the
video
below
the
house
really
wasn't
that
bad
at
the
start
it
wasn't
like
the
cleanest
but
it
wasn't
the
hell
house
it
became
he
said
although
there
was
always
one
room
the
backroom
that
was
totally
off
limits
flowers
admitted
pazuzu
wouldn't
let
anyone
go
there
and
the
basement
was
always
pretty
disgusting
i
didn't
go
down
there
but
the
rest
was
just
like
a
party
house
in
retrospect
flowers
concluded
it
seems
obvious
now
that
he
had
mental
health
issues
in
flowers
joined
the
army
and
was
deployed
to
iraq
following
his
tour
flowers
left
kuwait
and
moved
to
washington
state
where
he
got
back
in
touch
with
a
former
girlfriend
named
daisy
daisy
a
former
friend
of
algarad's
girlfriend
amber
burch
confided
in
flowers
and
told
him
she
helped
burch
and
algarad
bury
a
body
in
algarad's
backyard
flowers
who
went
on
to
marry
and
divorce
daisy
notified
police
via
an
anonymous
tip
that
there
was
a
body
buried
in
algarad's
yard
police
went
to
the
house
and
asked
to
look
in
the
backyard
but
algarad
simply
told
them
no
and
they
never
came
back
flowers
even
claimed
he
told
algarad
he
was
the
one
who
called
the
cops
and
that
he
kept
hanging
out
with
him
because
he
wanted
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
he
was
doing
and
didn't
want
him
hurting
people
algarad
and
his
girlfriend
burch
would
sacrifice
rabbits
and
smear
their
blood
on
their
bodies
in
front
of
an
altar
located
in
the
front
room
according
to
flowers
in
algarad
was
arrested
and
charged
as
an
accessory
to
the
murder
of
a
legally
blind
man
but
only
received
two
years
of
probation
at
some
point
flowers
became
enraged
with
algarad
after
he
asked
him
to
help
kill
a
man
and
threatened
to
rape
any
woman
who
flowers
brought
to
the
house
flowers
smashed
algarad's
head
against
a
cabinet
but
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
pain
saying
that's
why
i
love
you
brother
next
flowers
snapped
upon
learning
from
multiple
people
that
algarad
had
raped
a
soldier
that's
when
he
became
my
enemy
i
went
round
with
another
guy
and
we
went
round
to
kill
him
flowers
reminisced
flowers
knocked
algarad
out
and
stomped
on
his
face
with
his
boot
but
said
he
couldn't
kill
him
i'm
not
a
killer
not
many
people
are
he
said
flowers
once
again
went
to
the
police
following
the
attack
and
gave
them
details
of
where
the
body
was
buried
and
told
them
i'm
giving
you
one
week
and
if
you
don't
do
something
i
will
his
plan
was
to
sneak
into
algarad's
house
and
shoot
him
with
a
shotgun
before
turning
himself
in
but
three
days
later
the
forsyth
county
sheriff's
department
executed
a
search
warrant
on
the
home
looking
back
flowers
said
i
think
pazuzu
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
i
just
can't
say
for
sure
why
he
chose
wrong
this
terrifying
account
is
a
prime
example
of
the
direction
america
is
heading
as
satanism
and
demonic
behavior
is
becoming
increasingly
normalized
