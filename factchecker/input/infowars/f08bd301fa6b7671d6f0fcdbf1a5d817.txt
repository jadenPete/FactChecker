mccarthyism
actors
demand
blacklist
of
trump
supporters
in
hollywood
there
is
a
big
difference
between
political
donors
having
their
names
publicly
available
online
in
the
appropriate
context
and
actually
demanding
an
industry
blacklist
with
the
express
purpose
of
damaging
careers
and
reputations
entertainment
industry
figures
could
soon
find
themselves
on
a
blacklist
of
donald
trump
supporters
if
will
grace
co-stars
debra
messing
and
eric
mccormack
have
their
way
have
we
reached
peak
neo-mccarthyism
the
pair
are
demanding
that
the
hollywood
reporter
prints
a
full
list
of
attendees
for
an
upcoming
trump
fundraiser
in
beverly
hills
an
appeal
which
has
drawn
natural
comparisons
to
the
late
sen
joe
mccarthy's
efforts
in
the
s
to
rid
hollywood
of
communist
sympathizers
the
difference
is
this
time
the
calls
for
a
political
blacklist
are
coming
from
the
hollywood
left
itself
hey
thr
kindly
report
on
everyone
attending
this
event
so
the
rest
of
us
can
be
clear
about
who
we
don't
wanna
work
with
thx

ericmccormack
august
mccormack
was
the
first
to
request
a
list
of
everyone
attending
the
upcoming
beverly
hills
fundraiser
so
the
rest
of
us
can
be
clear
about
who
we
don't
wanna
sic
work
with
messing
soon
joined
in
tweeting
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
who
is
supporting
trump
the
public
does
indeed
have
a
right
to
know
who
a
political
candidate's
donors
are
particularly
when
those
donors
are
rich
and
powerful
this
is
exactly
why
campaign
finance
information
is
made
publicly
available
online
few
would
argue
against
this
kind
of
transparency
in
a
democracy
because
voters
are
entitled
to
know
how
their
elected
officials
are
being
influenced
on
policy
matters
the
motivation
behind
messing
and
mccormack's
blacklist
however
is
entirely
different
and
even
sinister
they
are
not
concerned
that
hollywood
celebrities
might
be
influencing
trump
on
policy
it's
far
simpler
than
that
they
want
those
who
disagree
with
their
politics
to
be
publicly
shamed
and
punished
for
it
responding
to
criticism
messing
tweeted
that
she
would
be
happy
to
be
listed
when
she
attends
a
political
fundraiser
why
wouldn't
trump
supporters
feel
the
same
she
asked
perhaps
because
of
people
like
you
debra
who
advocate
for
those
people
to
be
targeted
for
public
harassment
intimidation
and
shaming
while
demanding
professional
repercussions
for
their
political
views
you
want
to
create
a
mccarthy
blacklist
you
know
it
do
not
pretend
you
have
no
idea
what
the
issue
is
carmine
sabia

september
if
voters
aren't
happy
with
their
favorite
celebrity's
political
leanings
they
are
absolutely
free
to
abstain
from
viewing
their
movies
listening
to
their
music
or
reading
their
books
etc
that's
the
risk
public
figures
take
when
they
make
their
political
views
public
the
difference
is
when
messing
and
mccormack
contribute
to
the
candidates
of
their
choosing
no
one
demands
that
they
are
placed
on
a
list
to
make
it
easier
for
their
industry
colleagues
to
avoid
working
with
them
the
trump
blacklist
is
reminiscent
of
red
channels
a
s
pamphlet
on
communist
influence
in
radio
and
television
that
listed
industry
figures
whose
loyalties
to
the
us
were
questioned
because
of
their
leftist
political
beliefs
red
channels
was
published
in
the
right-wing
counterattack
journal
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
expose
the
alleged
communists
to
the
wider
public
messing
and
mccormack's
crusade
is
empty
activism
emblematic
of
the
resistance
celebrities
it
requires
no
courage
or
effort
to
expose
trump
supporters
in
hollywood
on
twitter
it
does
not
help
to
produce
political
change
and
serves
purely
as
an
egoic
exercise
for
those
who
crave
public
approval
and
pats
on
the
back
from
their
colleagues
is
everyone
involved
with
will
and
grace
a
deranged
mccarthyist
or
is
it
just
you
two

august
if
resistance
hollywood
was
really
interested
in
fighting
trump
on
the
issues
they
wouldn't
waste
their
time
on
vindictive
witch
hunts
and
personal
vendettas
designed
to
plump
up
their
own
profiles
there
is
a
big
difference
between
political
donors
having
their
names
publicly
available
online
in
the
appropriate
context
and
actually
demanding
an
industry
blacklist
with
the
express
purpose
of
damaging
careers
and
reputations
that
is
the
very
definition
of
mccarthyism
