leftist
council
member
says
cleaning
feces
off
seattle
streets
with
a
power
washer
is
racist
not
the
onion
a
leftist
council
member
recently
tried
to
stop
feces
being
cleaned
off
the
streets
of
seattle
with
a
power
washer
arguing
that
it
was
racist
yes
really
the
problem
centers
around
king
county
courthouse
in
downtown
seattle
where
homelessness
is
surging
and
a
tent
city
has
sprung
up
in
a
nearby
park
several
courthouse
employees
and
two
jurors
have
been
assaulted
the
area
is
also
littered
with
fecal
matter
leading
king
county
sheriff
john
urquhart
to
ask
the
county
to
order
a
daily
power
wash
of
the
sidewalks
which
reek
of
urine
and
excrement
however
leftist
council
member
larry
gossett
pushed
back
against
the
proposal
arguing
that
it
was
racist
because
power
washing
brought
back
images
of
the
use
of
hoses
against
civil-rights
activists
that's
right
because
high
pressure
water
hoses
were
once
used
over
years
ago
to
oppress
civil
rights
activists
that
means
streets
in
should
remain
smothered
in
shit
what's
next
maybe
we
should
just
let
fires
burn
endlessly
because
someone
might
get
offended
at
the
sight
of
a
hose
as
we
previously
reported
seattle
parks
are
becoming
no-go
areas
for
the
general
public
because
of
spiraling
problems
with
aggressive
homeless
people
and
trash
as
we
highlight
in
the
video
below
san
francisco
also
has
a
monumental
poop
problem
and
power
washers
seems
to
be
losing
the
battle
