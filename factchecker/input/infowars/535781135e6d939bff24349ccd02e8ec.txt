big
tech
big
brother
are
going
to
join
forces
to
secure
elections
until
darpa
is
ready
to
censor
information
and
punish
people
for
wrong
thinking
there's
microsoft's
electionguard
software
security
teams
for
facebook
google
twitter
and
microsoft
met
with
the
fbi
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
director
of
national
intelligence's
office
to
coordinate
a
strategy
to
secure
the
elections
and
by
secure
they
mean
to
manipulate
the
results
of
the
election
in
any
way
possible
to
get
the
outcome
they
desire
according
to
a
report
by
rt
the
big
tech
platforms
met
with
government
officials
at
facebook's
menlo
park
headquarters
on
wednesday
the
company
has
confirmed
boasting
that
big
tech
and
big
brother
have
developed
a
comprehensive
strategy
to
get
control
of
previous
election-related
vulnerabilities
while
analyzing
and
getting
ahead
of
new
threats
those
vulnerabilities
and
threats
are
the
free
thinkers
who
don't
buy
the
official
narrative
and
dissent
against
the
ruling
class
this
is
quickly
escalating
expect
the
censorship
social
credit
scores
and
gun
control
talk
to
ramp
up
as
the
political
class
realizes
people
may
not
be
as
easily
enslaved
as
they
have
imagined
facebook
has
scrambled
to
get
in
front
of
the
election
after
being
blamed
for
trump's
electoral
victory
over
merely
allowing
the
russian
trolls
to
buy
a
bunch
of
ads
most
of
those
ads
appeared
after
the
vote
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
election
google
on
the
other
hand
actively
attempted
to
manipulate
and
rig
the
election
in
favor
of
hillary
clinton
and
the
evidence
of
that
indiscretion
is
rapidly
becoming
overwhelming
google's
potential
to
sway
elections
has
been
the
subject
of
senate
hearings
and
yet
the
company
has
remained
silent
on
addressing
the
problem
subsidiary
youtube
meanwhile
conducted
another
round
of
mass
censorship
last
month
even
while
declaring
it
was
an
open
platform
for
controversial
ideas
facebook
insisted
last
week
it
had
tightened
its
rules
for
verifying
purchasers
of
political
ads
for
real
this
time
after
the
contest
showed
they
could
still
be
duped
into
running
obviously-fake
ads
paid
for
by
the
islamic
state
terror
group
and
cambridge
analytica
for
all
intents
and
purposes
this
meeting
was
to
make
sure
certain
ideas
are
censored
so
that
only
government-approved
opinions
can
be
made
available
as
information
the
electoral
meeting
of
the
minds
came
less
than
a
week
after
the
pentagon's
defense
advanced
projects
research
agency
darpa
declared
war
on
deepfakes
and
other
potentially
discord-sowing
information
like
memes
promising
to
neutralize
all
malicious
content
within
four
years
if
not
for
this
election
then
certainly
for
the
next
until
darpa
is
ready
to
censor
information
and
punish
people
for
wrong
thinking
there's
microsoft's
electionguard
software
the
company
announced
in
july
that
they
would
provide
this
software
to
all
the
nation's
voting
machines
free
of
charge
and
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
and
the
pentagon-owned
contractor
that
helped
develop
the
program's
heart
