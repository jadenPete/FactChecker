how
gdp
measures
help
create
the
illusion
that
money-pumping
grows
the
economy
real
gdp
does
not
measure
the
real
strength
of
an
economy
but
reflects
monetary
turnover
thus
the
more
money
is
pumped
the
stronger
the
economy
appears
to
be
in
response
to
a
weakening
in
the
yearly
growth
rate
of
key
economic
indicators
such
as
industrial
production
and
real
gross
domestic
product
gdp
some
commentators
have
raised
the
alarm
of
the
possibility
of
a
recession
emerging
some
other
commentators
are
dismissive
of
this
arguing
that
the
likelihood
of
a
recession
ahead
is
not
very
high
given
that
other
important
indicators
such
as
consumer
outlays
as
depicted
by
the
annual
growth
rate
of
retail
sales
and
the
state
of
employment
appear
to
be
in
good
shape
see
charts
most
experts
tend
to
assess
the
strength
of
an
economy
in
terms
of
real
gross
domestic
product
gdp
which
supposedly
mirrors
the
total
amount
of
final
goods
and
services
produced
to
calculate
a
total
several
things
must
be
added
together
in
order
to
add
things
together
they
must
have
some
unit
in
common
it
is
not
possibl
however
to
add
refrigerators
to
cars
and
shirts
to
obtain
the
total
amount
of
final
goods
since
total
real
output
cannot
be
defined
in
a
meaningful
way
obviously
it
cannot
be
quantified
to
overcome
this
problem
economists
employ
total
monetary
expenditure
on
goods
which
they
divide
by
an
average
price
of
goods
however
is
the
calculation
of
an
average
price
possible
suppose
two
transactions
are
conducted
in
the
first
transaction
one
tv
set
is
exchanged
for
in
the
second
transaction
one
shirt
is
exchanged
for
the
price
or
the
rate
of
exchange
in
the
first
transaction
is
tv
set
the
price
in
the
second
transaction
is
shirt
in
order
to
calculate
the
average
price
we
must
add
these
two
ratios
and
divide
them
by
however
tv
set
cannot
be
added
to
shirt
implying
that
it
is
not
possible
to
establish
an
average
price
on
this
rothbard
wrote
in
man
economy
and
state
thus
any
concept
of
average
price
level
involves
adding
or
multiplying
quantities
of
completely
different
units
of
goods
such
as
butter
hats
sugar
etc
and
is
therefore
meaningless
and
illegitimate
since
gdp
is
expressed
in
dollar
terms
which
are
deflated
by
a
dubious
price
deflator
it
is
obvious
that
the
so
called
real
gdp
fluctuations
mirror
fluctuations
in
the
amount
of
dollars
pumped
into
the
economy
hence
various
statements
by
government
statisticians
regarding
the
growth
rate
of
the
real
economy
are
nothing
more
than
a
reflection
of
the
fluctuations
in
the
growth
rate
of
the
money
supply
now
once
a
recession
is
assessed
in
terms
of
real
gdp
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
central
bank
appears
to
be
able
to
counter
the
recessionary
effects
that
emerge
for
instance
by
pushing
more
money
into
the
economy
the
central
bank's
actions
would
appear
to
be
effective
since
real
gdp
will
show
a
positive
response
to
this
pumping
after
a
time
lag
remember
that
changes
in
real
gdp
reflect
changes
in
money
supply
this
means
that
if
the
economy
can
be
expressed
through
indicators
such
as
gdp
then
this
will
allow
the
central
bank
to
appear
to
be
able
to
navigate
the
economy
i
e
gdp
by
means
of
a
suitable
policy
mix
in
addition
it
makes
sense
to
demand
that
the
central
bank
should
interfere
in
order
to
help
the
economy
why
business
cycles
are
recurrenteven
if
one
were
to
accept
that
real
gdp
is
not
a
fiction
and
depicts
the
so-called
true
economy
there
is
still
a
problem
as
to
why
recessions
are
of
a
recurrent
nature
is
it
possible
that
it
is
only
external
shocks
that
cause
this
repetitive
occurrence
of
recessions
surely
there
must
be
a
mechanism
here
that
gives
rise
to
this
repetitive
occurrence
in
a
free
market
we
could
envisage
that
the
economy
would
be
subject
to
various
shocks
but
it
is
difficult
to
envisage
a
phenomenon
of
recurrent
boom-bust
cycles
according
to
rothbard
before
the
industrial
revolution
in
approximately
the
late
th
century
there
were
no
regularly
recurring
booms
and
depressions
there
would
be
a
sudden
economic
crisis
whenever
some
king
made
war
or
confiscated
the
property
of
his
subjects
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
peculiarly
modern
phenomena
of
general
and
fairly
regular
swings
in
business
fortunes
of
expansions
and
contractions
the
boom-bust
cycle
phenomenon
is
somehow
linked
to
the
modern
world
but
what
is
the
link
the
source
of
recurrent
recessions
turns
out
to
be
the
alleged
protector
of
the
economy
the
central
bank
itself
we
suggest
that
the
phenomenon
of
recessions
is
not
about
the
weakness
of
the
economy
as
such
but
about
the
liquidation
of
various
activities
that
sprang
up
on
the
back
of
the
loose
monetary
policies
of
the
central
bank
here
is
why
a
loose
central
bank
monetary
policy
which
results
in
an
expansion
of
money
out
of
thin
air
sets
in
motion
an
exchange
of
nothing
for
something
which
amounts
to
a
diversion
of
real
wealth
from
wealth-generating
activities
to
non-wealth-generating
activities
in
the
process
this
diversion
weakens
wealth
generators
and
this
in
turn
weakens
their
ability
to
grow
the
overall
pool
of
real
wealth
the
expansion
in
activities
that
emerge
from
the
loose
monetary
policy
is
what
an
economic
boom
or
false
economic
prosperity
is
all
about
note
that
an
increase
in
the
monetary
pumping
due
to
loose
monetary
policy
of
the
central
bank
lifts
the
monetary
turnover
and
hence
gdp
once
this
monetary
turnover
is
deflated
by
the
so-called
average
price
index
this
will
manifest
itself
in
terms
of
a
strengthening
in
real
gdp
most
experts
and
commentator
are
likely
to
proclaim
that
the
central
bank's
loose
monetary
policies
were
successful
in
growing
the
economy
once
however
the
central
bank
tightens
its
monetary
stance
this
slows
down
the
diversion
of
real
wealth
from
wealth
producers
to
non-wealth
producers
activities
that
sprang
up
on
the
back
of
the
previous
loose
monetary
policy
are
now
getting
less
support
from
the
money
supply
they
fall
into
trouble
and
an
economic
bust
or
recession
emerges
in
terms
of
the
monetary
turnover
deflated
by
the
average
price
index
i
e
the
growth
rate
of
real
gdp
comes
under
downward
pressure
activities
that
emerged
on
the
back
of
previous
loose
monetary
policy
cannot
now
divert
real
wealth
to
support
themselves
this
is
because
these
activities
were
never
economically
viable
they
could
not
support
themselves
without
the
diversion
of
real
wealth
to
them
by
means
of
an
expansion
in
money
supply
consequently
most
of
these
activities
are
likely
to
perish
or
barely
survive
could
these
activities
escape
the
consequences
of
a
bust
if
they
are
well
managed
and
have
solid
appearance
for
instance
as
a
result
of
the
loose
monetary
stance
on
the
part
of
the
fed
various
activities
emerge
to
accommodate
the
demand
for
goods
and
services
of
the
first
receivers
of
newly
injected
money
now
even
if
these
activities
are
well
managed
and
maintain
very
efficient
inventory
control
this
fact
cannot
be
of
much
help
once
the
central
bank
reverses
its
loose
monetary
stance
these
activities
are
the
product
of
the
loose
monetary
stance
of
the
central
bank
and
they
were
never
approved
by
the
market
as
such
they
emerged
on
account
of
the
increase
in
money
supply
which
gave
rise
to
an
increased
demand
for
goods
once
the
central
bank
monetary
stance
is
reversed
regardless
of
efficient
inventory
management
these
activities
will
come
under
pressure
and
run
the
risk
of
being
liquidated
the
supply
of
real
savings
is
not
large
enough
to
support
these
activities
from
what
was
said
we
could
conclude
that
recessions
are
about
the
liquidation
of
economic
activities
that
emerged
on
the
back
of
the
loose
monetary
policy
of
the
central
bank
this
recessionary
process
is
set
in
motion
when
the
central
bank
reverses
its
earlier
loose
stance
note
that
recession
is
good
news
for
wealth
generators
since
less
real
wealth
is
now
being
taken
from
them
this
means
that
central
bank's
ongoing
policies
that
are
aimed
at
mitigating
the
consequences
that
arise
from
its
earlier
attempts
at
stabilizing
the
so-called
economy
i
e
real
gdp
are
key
factors
behind
the
repetitive
boom-bust
cycles
because
of
the
variable
time
lags
from
changes
in
money
to
changes
in
prices
and
changes
in
real
gdp
fed
policy
makers
are
confronted
with
economic
data
that
could
be
in
conflict
with
the
fed's
targets
hence
this
forces
central
bank
officials
to
respond
to
the
effects
of
their
own
previous
monetary
policies
note
that
fed
policy
makers
regard
themselves
as
being
responsible
to
bring
the
so-called
economy
onto
a
path
of
stable
economic
growth
and
stable
price
inflation
consequently
any
deviation
from
the
stable
growth
path
as
outlined
by
policy
makers
sets
the
fed's
response
in
terms
of
either
tighter
or
looser
stance
these
responses
to
the
effects
of
past
policies
give
rise
to
fluctuations
in
the
growth
rate
of
the
money
supply
and
in
turn
to
recurrent
boom-bust
cycles
in
fact
the
downtrend
in
the
yearly
growth
rate
in
the
adjusted
money
supply
ams
during
to
was
responsible
for
the
economic
slump
of
an
uptrend
in
the
growth
rate
of
ams
during
to
provided
a
support
for
the
strengthening
in
economic
activity
until
very
recently
a
visible
decline
in
the
annual
growth
rate
in
ams
since
has
set
in
motion
an
economic
slump
this
slump
is
likely
to
strengthen
as
time
goes
by
even
if
the
fed
were
to
lift
aggressively
its
monetary
pumping
it
will
not
be
possible
to
reverse
the
downtrend
in
the
ams
growth
rate
instantly
the
state
of
the
pool
of
real
wealth
is
going
to
determine
the
severity
of
the
downturn
we
suggest
that
prolonged
reckless
monetary
and
fiscal
policies
have
likely
severely
undermined
the
process
of
real
wealth
generation
this
in
turn
raises
the
likelihood
that
the
pool
of
real
wealth
is
hardly
growing
consequently
it
will
not
surprise
us
that
the
likely
emerging
economic
downturn
is
going
to
be
quite
severe
by
most
historical
standards
it
is
now
popular
to
blame
the
policies
of
the
us
president
trump
in
particular
his
trade
war
with
china
as
the
key
factor
behind
a
possible
recession
ahead
while
president
trumps
policies
are
not
in
the
spirit
of
the
free
market
we
suggest
that
the
downtrend
in
the
ams
annual
growth
rate
since
has
nothing
to
do
with
president
trump's
policies
but
with
the
policies
of
the
fed
conclusionsrecessions
which
are
set
in
motion
by
a
tight
monetary
stance
of
the
central
bank
are
about
the
liquidations
of
activities
that
sprang
up
on
the
back
of
the
previous
loose
monetary
policies
rather
than
paying
attention
to
the
so-called
strength
of
real
gdp
to
ascertain
where
the
economy
is
heading
it
will
be
more
helpful
to
pay
attention
to
the
growth
rate
of
the
money
supply
by
following
the
growth
rate
of
the
money
supply
one
can
ascertain
the
pace
of
damage
to
the
real
economy
that
central
bank
policies
inflict
thus
the
increase
in
the
growth
momentum
of
money
should
mean
that
the
pace
of
wealth
destruction
is
intensifying
conversely
a
fall
in
the
growth
momentum
of
money
should
mean
that
the
pace
of
wealth
destruction
is
weakening
real
gdp
growth
rate
does
not
measure
the
real
strength
of
an
economy
but
rather
reflects
monetary
turnover
adjusted
by
a
dubious
statistic
called
the
price
deflator
obviously
then
the
more
money
is
pumped
all
other
things
being
equal
the
stronger
the
economy
appears
to
be
in
this
framework
of
thinking
one
is
not
surprised
that
the
fed
can
drive
the
economy
since
by
means
of
monetary
pumping
the
central
bank
can
influence
the
gdp
growth
rate
by
means
of
the
real
gdp
statistic
fed
policy
makers
and
government
officials
can
create
an
illusion
that
they
can
grow
the
economy
in
reality
the
policy
of
intervention
of
the
fed
and
the
government
can
only
deepen
the
economic
impoverishment
by
weakening
wealth
generators
it
now
seems
to
be
the
consensus
that
the
key
factor
behind
a
possible
recession
ahead
would
be
the
policies
of
the
us
president
trump
in
particular
his
trade
war
with
china
as
however
we
suggest
that
a
key
cause
behind
the
possible
recession
had
already
been
set
in
motion
by
the
downtrend
in
the
ams
annual
growth
rate
since
this
downtrend
has
nothing
to
do
with
president
trump's
current
policies
but
with
the
past
policies
of
the
fed
alex
jones
is
sending
an
emergency
message
to
president
trump
about
the
methods
being
used
to
eliminate
free
speech
on
the
internet
and
to
seize
control
of
future
elections
