if
you
use
straws
or
eat
burgers
you're
part
of
the
problem
dem
presidential
hopeful
guilt
trips
millions
of
americans
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
alisyn
camerota
on
thursday
democrat
presidential
candidate
pete
buttigieg
criticized
americans
who
use
straws
or
eat
hamburgers
saying
they're
part
of
the
problem
in
the
beginning
of
the
video
camerota
claimed
she
hasn't
used
a
plastic
straw
in
six
months
because
she's
so
worried
about
what's
happening
in
the
ocean
she
then
asked
buttigieg
what
people
can
do
to
not
feel
so
helpless
in
the
face
of
something
so
existential
it's
not
only
about
all
of
the
things
we've
got
to
do
technologically
and
with
regulation
and
so
on
it's
about
summoning
the
energies
of
this
country
to
do
something
unbelievably
hard
he
replied
by
saying
we've
got
to
use
regulations
to
battle
climate
change
mayor
pete
is
admitting
he'd
use
government
mandates
to
go
after
plastic
straw
users
and
meat-eaters
continuing
buttigieg
said
see
right
now
we're
in
a
mode
where
i
think
we're
thinking
about
it
mostly
through
the
perspective
of
guilt
you
know
from
using
a
straw
to
eating
a
burger
am
i
part
of
the
problem
and
in
a
certain
way
yes
but
the
most
exciting
thing
is
that
we
can
all
be
part
of
the
solution
so
he
says
americans
are
viewing
the
issue
of
climate
change
through
the
perspective
of
guilt
and
then
tells
people
who
eat
burgers
and
use
straws
they're
a
part
of
the
problem
in
the
next
sentence
this
is
one
more
example
of
democrat
politicians
putting
americans
through
a
guilt
trip
in
order
to
further
their
political
agenda
for
example
new
york
city
mayor
bill
de
blasio
has
shamed
new
yorkers
for
eating
too
many
hot
dogs
and
vows
to
reduce
the
city's
processed
meat
consumption
kaitlin
bennett
asks
new
yorkers
if
they
want
to
ban
hot
dogs
shockingly
they
are
okay
with
mayor
de
blasio's
initiative
to
ban
wieners
