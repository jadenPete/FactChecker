forget
the
russians
it's
the
federal
reserve
seeking
to
meddle
in
our
elections
if
we
want
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
liberty
we
must
audit
and
then
end
the
federal
reserve
the
us
constitution
never
granted
the
federal
government
authority
to
create
a
central
bank
the
founders
having
lived
through
hyperinflation
themselves
understood
that
government
should
never
have
a
printing
press
at
its
disposal
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
america's
founding
the
desire
for
a
crony
central
bank
was
strong
in
fact
two
attempts
were
made
at
creating
a
permanent
central
bank
in
america
prior
to
the
creation
of
the
fed
fortunately
the
charter
for
the
first
bank
was
allowed
to
expire
in
and
president
andrew
jackson
closed
down
the
second
bank
in
but
unfortunately
a
third
attempt
was
successful
and
the
federal
reserve
was
unconstitutionally
created
by
congress
in
americans
have
been
living
under
a
corrupt
and
immoral
monetary
system
ever
since
the
federal
reserve
is
the
printing
press
that
has
financed
the
creation
of
the
largest
government
to
ever
exist
endless
welfare
and
endless
military
spending
are
both
made
possible
by
the
federal
reserve
the
fed
can
just
print
the
money
for
whatever
the
us
establishment
wants
so
those
of
us
who
long
for
a
constitutional
and
limited
government
have
few
tools
at
our
disposal
despite
all
the
propaganda
claiming
independence
the
fed
has
always
been
a
deeply
political
institution
because
the
fed
is
a
government-created
monopoly
with
key
government-appointed
employees
its
so-called
independence
is
a
mere
fiction
however
the
us
congress
created
the
fed
with
legislation
it
can
also
abolish
the
fed
with
legislation
last
week
the
facade
of
federal
reserve
independence
was
dealt
a
severe
blow
ironically
the
person
who
broadcast
to
the
world
that
the
fed
is
anything
but
independent
was
ex-new
york
fed
president
bill
dudley
dudley
wrote
that
trump's
re-election
arguably
presents
a
threat
to
the
united
states
and
global
economy
and
if
the
goal
of
monetary
policy
is
to
achieve
the
best
long-term
economic
outcome
the
fed's
officials
should
consider
how
their
decisions
would
affect
the
political
outcome
of
the
timing
of
dudley's
threats
to
use
fed
monetary
policy
to
affect
the
outcome
of
a
us
election
couldn't
come
at
a
more
striking
time
after
all
for
more
than
two
solid
years
americans
have
been
bombarded
with
fabricated
stories
about
russians
rigging
our
elections
and
yet
here
is
a
federal
reserve
official
threatening
to
do
the
same
exact
thing
but
this
time
for
real
whether
it's
the
mainstream
media
the
cia
the
fbi
or
now
the
federal
reserve
more
and
more
americans
are
waking
up
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
deep
state
in
america
and
its
interests
have
nothing
to
do
with
american
liberty
in
fact
our
liberty
is
what
the
deep
state
wants
to
abolish
when
it
comes
to
the
federal
reserve
i
stand
firmly
by
my
conviction
that
it
needs
to
be
audited
and
then
ended
as
soon
as
possible
america's
founders
were
not
perfect
they
were
human
beings
just
as
capable
of
error
as
we
are
but
they
had
a
remarkable
understanding
of
the
ideas
of
liberty
they
understood
that
liberty
cannot
exist
with
a
government
that
has
access
to
a
printing
press
sound
money
and
liberty
go
hand-in-hand
if
we
want
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
liberty
we
must
audit
and
then
end
the
federal
reserve
