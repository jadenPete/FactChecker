lawyers
even
if
he
did
lie
police
to
blame
for
taking
seriously
empire
actor
the
real
victim
because
he
didn't
know
his
hate
crime
claim
would
be
investigated
they
say
jussie
smollett's
attorneys
claimed
that
even
if
the
empire
actor
did
lie
about
his
alleged
racial
attack
the
chicago
police
are
actually
to
blame
for
investigating
his
claim
so
vigorously
yes
you
read
that
right
the
bizarre
claim
by
smollett's
legal
team
was
made
in
a
court
motion
filed
wednesday
where
the
city
of
chicago
is
attempting
to
recoup
spent
in
police
overtime
related
to
investigating
smollett's
hate
crime
hoax
from
the
chicago
sun-times
in
the
legal
brief
obtained
by
sneed
smollett
makes
clear
that
he
is
not
admitting
he
made
false
statements
mr
smollett
disputes
any
and
all
assertions
that
he
made
a
false
statement
and
was
not
a
victim
of
a
crime
a
footnote
on
the
first
page
of
the
motion
reads
but
even
if
he
did
the
filing
of
a
police
report
in
and
of
itself
does
not
necessitate
a
sprawling
investigation
nor
does
it
as
a
practical
matter
usually
result
in
an
investigation
as
extensive
as
the
one
the
cpd
chose
to
undertake
in
this
case
the
motion
says
the
city
has
failed
to
allege
that
mr
smollett
was
similarly
well
aware
that
his
statements
to
police
would
result
in
hours
of
police
overtime
or
any
other
reasons
why
he
should
have
known
this
would
have
been
the
case
in
other
words
smollett
is
the
victim
because
he
didn't
know
his
false
police
report
would
actually
be
investigated
surely
smollett
knew
his
police
report
would
likely
receive
widespread
media
coverage
as
he
went
on
several
major
outlets
including
his
famous
crying
interview
with
abc's
robin
roberts
the
actor
was
eventually
let
go
from
empire
last
month
after
the
chicago
police
released
smollet's
sealed
case
files
detailing
his
plot
to
hire
maga
hat-wearing
nigerian
extras
from
empire
to
stage
a
racial
attack
against
him
in
order
to
blame
trump
supporters
the
accomplices
known
as
the
osundairo
brothers
sued
smollett
for
defamation
in
april
after
the
actor
refused
to
come
clean
about
his
hate
crime
hoax
though
smollett
still
maintains
his
innocence
the
cultural
zeitgeist
has
determined
him
to
be
a
liar
and
a
fraud
in
light
of
the
mountains
of
evidence
that's
surfaced
since
he
filed
the
police
report
in
january
with
comedians
like
dave
chappelle
mockingly
referring
to
him
as
juicy
smoli
t
this
is
why
leftist
critics
are
trying
to
sink
chappelle's
new
show
most
of
it
actually
has
a
pro-social
justice
bias
but
a
single
scintilla
of
dissent
must
not
be
allowed
