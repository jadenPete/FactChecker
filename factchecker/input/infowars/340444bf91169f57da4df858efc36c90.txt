face
insolvency
risk

fear
dorian's
insured
losses
could
top
billion
mandatory
evacuation
orders
are
expected
to
be
issued
in
several
counties
in
florida
as
well
as
the
carolinas
insurances
companies
could
be
in
serious
trouble
now
that
hurricane
dorian
has
spent
a
full
day
dragging
across
the
bahamas
according
to
a
team
of
analysts
at
ubs
after
battering
the
caribbean
island
nation
with
gusts
of
up
to
mph
the
unprecedented
category
storm
looks
to
be
one
of
the
most
damaging
storms
in
recent
memory
now
that
dorian
has
officially
cemented
its
position
as
the
second-strongest
storm
to
form
in
the
atlantic
in
modern
history
ubs
analysts
have
updated
their
models
to
reflect
a
broader
swath
of
losses
it's
now
believed
the
storm
could
cause
total
insured
losses
in
the
range
of
billion
to
billion
with
a
base
case
of
billion
up
from
billion
a
few
days
ago
this
could
put
solvency
capital
at
risk
for
some
firms
the
team
of
analysts
said
according
to
sputnik
the
analysts
estimate
the
hurricane
season
could
cause
about
billion
of
natural
catastrophe
losses
which
could
erode
excess
capital
and
lead
to
higher
premiums
though
they
got
some
relief
last
year
insurers
faced
record
bills
from
hurricanes
earthquakes
and
wildfires
in
as
hurricanes
maria
harvey
and
irma
hammered
puerto
rico
and
the
continental
us
and
wildfires
in
california
led
to
the
most
destructive
season
on
record
of
the
big
reinsurance
names
ubs
named
swiss
re
as
its
least
preferred
stock
to
hold
during
the
hurricane
season
adding
that
a
second
buyback
was
unlikely
meanwhile
lancashire
beazley
and
scor
were
set
to
see
the
biggest
gains
from
an
increase
in
premiums
across
the
industry
mandatory
evacuation
orders
are
expected
to
be
issued
in
several
counties
in
florida
as
well
as
the
carolinas
later
monday
evening
dorian's
eye
had
finally
reached
great
bahama
though
officials
warned
residents
who
had
opted
to
remain
in
the
area
to
remain
wary
even
under
the
eye
meteorologists
still
expect
wind
speeds
of
around
mph
fortunately
as
of
monday
morning
a
direct
hit
in
florida
was
seen
as
less
likely
thought
it's
impossible
to
say
with
any
degree
of
certainty
how
the
storm
will
make
landfall
in
the

ceo
susan
wojcicki
said
tuesday
that
it's
more
important
than
ever
for

to
remain
an
open

just
one
day
after

massive
