doj
is
going
to
have
to
indict
andrew
mccabe
deep
state
lackey
knowingly
lied
to
government
over
russia
witch
hunt
against
trump
disgraced
former
fbi
deputy
director
andrew
mccabe
will
likely
be
indicted
by
the
justice
department
for
lying
to
the
government
according
to
rep
john
ratcliffe
r-texas
here
you
have
the
inspector
general
stating
that
andrew
mccabe
did
that
multiple
times
and
the
magic
words
did
so
intentionally
and
knowing
ratcliffe
told
sunday
morning
futures
host
maria
bartiromo
i
think
the
department
of
justice
is
going
to
have
to
indict
andy
mccabe
simply
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
admit
that
there
are
separate
standards
for
people
doing
the
same
thing
for
the
same
conduct
ratcliffe
added
that
the
doj
has
little
choice
because
they
had
made
a
cottage
industry
out
of
charging
people
like
general
flynn
and
george
papadopoulos
for
lying
to
investigators
so
a
central
standard
must
be
upheld
i
don't
know
how
you
can't
indict
him
when
he
is
engaged
in
the
same
conduct
that
other
people
have
recently
been
charged
for
at
the
department
of
justice
particularly
when
your
own
watchdog
says
that
those
lies
were
done
intentionally
and
knowingly
and
done
repeatedly
he
said
you
can't
really
tell
the
public
we're
going
to
treat
people
differently
for
the
same
conduct
inspector
general
michael
horowitz's
report
on
fisa
abuses
is
believed
to
be
released
in
the
coming
weeks
which
the
doj
will
use
to
inform
them
of
any
charges
that
must
be
handed
down
including
for
mccabe
and
former
fbi
director
james
comey
who
skated
on
charges
of
leaking
classified
memos
to
the
press
andrew
mccabe
has
been
hitting
all
the
talk
shows
and
has
made
claims
that
president
trump
possibly
worked
for
russia
alex
