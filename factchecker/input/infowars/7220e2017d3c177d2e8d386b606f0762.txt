cnn
asks
why
don't
people
like
clowns
as
drag
queen
story
time
receives
nationwide
pushback
like
clowns
drag
queens
exhibit
creepy
bizarre
physical
and
behavioral
characteristics
a
study
featured
on
cnn
attempted
to
ask
the
question
why
do
people
think
clowns
are
so
creepy
psychologist
frank
mcandrew
conducted
a
study
to
answer
that
very
question
and
the
results
are
unsurprising
which
may
help
answer
why
many
parents
and
children
find
drag
queen
story
time
to
be
creepy
as
well
mcandrew
had
over
volunteers
aged
between
to
fill
out
an
online
survey
asking
what
behaviors
physical
characteristics
and
hobbies
they
found
to
be
creepy
the
results
indicated
that
people
we
perceive
as
creepy
are
much
more
likely
to
be
males
than
females
that
unpredictability
is
an
important
component
of
creepiness
and
that
unusual
patterns
of
eye
contact
and
other
nonverbal
behaviors
set
off
our
creepiness
detectors
big
time
mcandrew
wrote
unusual
or
strange
physical
characteristics
such
as
bulging
eyes
a
peculiar
smile
or
inordinately
long
fingers
did
not
in
and
of
themselves
cause
us
to
perceive
someone
as
creepy
but
the
presence
of
weird
physical
traits
can
amplify
any
other
creepy
tendencies
that
the
person
might
be
exhibiting
such
as
persistently
steering
conversations
toward
peculiar
sexual
topics
or
failing
to
understand
the
policy
about
bringing
reptiles
into
the
office
when
we
asked
people
to
rate
the
creepiness
of
different
occupations
the
one
that
rose
to
the
top
of
the
creep
list
was
you
guessed
it
clowns
mcandrew
added
in
other
words
clowns
appear
like
menacing
demons
at
an
archetypal
level
with
their
bizarre
physical
and
behavioral
characteristics
but
if
that's
the
case
why
do
drag
queens
essentially
dress
as
clowns
for
their
drag
queen
story
time
events
it
could
be
because
they
enjoy
horrifying
children
as
a
sick
form
of
child
abuse
in
their
mission
to
confuse
their
gender
identities
in
any
case
it
does
help
explain
why
many
parents
are
outraged
at
the
events
aimed
at
grooming
their
children
children
are
now
being
encouraged
to
roll
around
in
drag
queens
crotches
as
they
play
ride
the
horsie
games
with
men
dressed
as
women
