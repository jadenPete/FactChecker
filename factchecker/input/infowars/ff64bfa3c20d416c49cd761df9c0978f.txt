suit
by
victims
claim
former
fbi
director
shut
down
investigation
into
saudi
arabia's
role
robert
mueller
pitched
as
an
incorruptible
beacon
of
justice
when
he
was
tasked
with
unsuccessfully
hunting
down
ties
between
donald
trump
and
russia
was
nothing
more
than
a
hatchet
man
for
the
deep
state
who
participated
in
a
coverup
of
saudi
arabia's
role
in
according
to
a
new
report
by
the
new
york
post's
paul
sperry
citing
former
fbi
investigators
and
a
new
lawsuit
by
victims
according
to
sperry
mueller
stonewalled
after
fbi
agents
discovered
evidence
of
multiple
systemic
efforts
by
the
saudi
government
to
assist
the
hijackers
in
the
lead-up
to
the
attacks
while
the
former
fbi
director
allegedly
covered
up
evidence
pointing
back
to
the
saudi
embassy
and
riyadh
and
may
have
even
misled
congress
about
what
he
knew
he
was
the
master
when
it
came
to
covering
up
the
kingdom's
role
in
said
sharon
premoli
a
september
th
survivor
who
was
pulled
out
of
the
rubble
of
the
world
trade
center
and
is
now
suing
saudi
arabia
as
a
plaintiff
in
a
new
lawsuit
in
october
of
mueller
shut
down
the
government's
investigation
after
only
three
weeks
and
then
took
part
in
the
bush
administration's
campaign
to
block
obfuscate
and
generally
stop
anything
about
saudi
arabia
from
being
released
she
added
any
letting
the
saudis
off
the
hook
came
from
the
white
house
said
former
agent
mark
rossini
adding
i
can
still
see
that
photo
of
bandar
and
bush
enjoying
cigars
on
the
balcony
of
the
white
house
two
days
after
speaking
with
multiple
fbi
case
agents
sperry
lists
a
series
of
incidents
describing
mueller
throwing
up
roadblocks
in
front
of
his
own
investigators
making
it
easier
for
saudi
suspects
to
escape
questioning
and
according
to
the
lawsuit
mueller
deep-sixed
what
evidence
his
agents
did
manage
to
uncover
via
the
ny
post
time
and
again
agents
were
called
off
from
pursuing
leads
back
to
the
kingdom's
embassy
in
washington
as
well
as
its
consulate
in
los
angeles
where
former
fbi
agent
stephen
moore
headed
a
task
force
looking
into
local
contacts
made
by
two
of
the
saudi
hijackers
moore
testified
in
an
affidavit
for
the
lawsuit
he
concluded
that
diplomatic
and
intelligence
personnel
of
saudi
arabia
knowingly
provided
material
support
to
the
two
hijackers
and
facilitated
the
plot
yet
he
and
his
team
were
not
allowed
to
interview
them
according
to
the
suit
in
washington
former
fbi
agent
john
guandolo
who
worked
terror
cases
out
of
the
bureau's
dc
office
said
then-saudi
ambassador
prince
bandar
should
have
been
treated
as
a
terrorist
suspect
for
giving
money
to
a
woman
who
funded
two
of
the
hijackers
but
he
was
never
questioned
either
guandolo
said
instead
mueller
obliged
what
guandolo
called
an
outrageous
request
from
bandar
within
days
of
the
attacks
to
help
evacuate
from
the
country
dozens
of
saudi
officials
including
at
least
one
osama
bin
laden
relative
on
the
terror
watch
list
mueller
assured
their
safe
passage
to
planes
using
agents
as
personal
escorts
according
to
fbi
documents
obtained
by
judicial
watch
agents
who
should
have
been
interrogating
the
saudis
instead
acted
as
their
bodyguards
in
mueller
prevented
agents
from
arresting
the
saudi-sponsored
al
qaeda
cleric
who
privately
counseled
the
saudi
hijackers
said
raymond
fournier
an
agent
with
the
joint
terrorism
task
force
in
san
diego
at
the
time
he
was
responsible
for
vacating
the
arrest
warrant
for
anwar
al-awlaki
for
passport
fraud
fournier
said
he
even
ordered
agents
who
detained
the
fiend
at
jfk
to
release
him
into
the
custody
of
a
saudi
representative
fournier
said
the
fbi
closed
their
investigation
of
awlaki
who
was
allowed
to
leave
the
us
on
a
saudi
plane
shortly
thereafter
the
fort
hood
shooting
occurred
and
awlaki's
fingerprints
were
all
over
that
incident
said
former
fbi
agent
michael
biasello
who
helped
work
the
texas
terror
case
at
the
same
time
mueller
removed
a
veteran
agent
from
investigating
a
tip
that
an
adviser
to
the
saudi
royal
family
had
met
with
some
of
the
saudi
hijackers
at
his
home
in
sarasota
fla
effectively
killing
the
case
according
to
the
lawsuit
the
home
was
suddenly
abandoned
two
weeks
before
mueller
even
tried
to
shut
down
a
congressional
investigation
into
the
saudi
hijackers
and
their
contacts
in
la
and
san
diego
said
bob
graham
who
led
the
joint
inquiry
as
senate
intelligence
committee
chair
the
strongest
objections
to
his
staff
investigators
visiting
fbi
offices
there
came
from
the
fbi
director
himself
said
graham
in
a
interview
with
harper's
magazine
among
other
things
mueller
refused
their
demands
to
question
a
paid
fbi
informant
who
roomed
with
the
hijackers
and
even
moved
him
to
a
safe
house
where
they
couldn't
find
him
graham
said
mueller
with
the
white
house
redacted
pages
detailing
saudi-
ties
from
the
congressional
report
he
also
gave
testimony
to
congress
that
was
at
the
very
least
misleading
in
an
october
closed-door
hearing
mueller
claimed
he
found
out
about
saudi-
connections
only
as
a
result
of
the
joint
inquiry's
investigative
work
s
ome
facts
came
to
light
here
and
to
me
frankly
that
had
not
come
to
light
before
only
moore
said
he
gave
mueller
daily
briefings
on
such
connections
in
mueller
also
testified
the
hijackers
contacted
no
known
terrorist
sympathizers
in
the
united
states
even
though
the
fbi's
own
case
files
showed
they
had
contact
with
at
least
terrorist
suspects
and
sympathizers
in
the
us
prior
to
including
some
working
for
the
saudi
government
in
later
testimony
he
tried
to
walk
this
back
insisting
he
had
no
intent
to
mislead
he's
a
villain
and
an
arrogant
one
to
boot
said
former
fbi
agent
mark
wauck
who
called
mueller
a
servant
of
the
deep
state
victims
compensation
bill
the
alleged
death
of
osama
bin
laden's
son
reports
that
the
mastermind
of
attack
will
talk
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
but
the
media
keeps
quiet
about
ny
fire
commissioners
joining
lawyers
committee
for
inquiry
to
demand
a
real
grand
jury
investigation
of
overwhelming
evidence
of
