using
smart

you
should
have

usage
than
we
have
today
a
leading
tech
investor
has
warned
that
companies
such
as
amazon
and
google
are
using
smart
speakers
for
surveillance
purposes
in
an
interview
with
yahoo
news
john
borthwick
of
betaworks
said
that
the
information
recorded
by
the
devices
and
relayed
back
to
the
host
companies
cannot
be
described
any
other
way
i
would
say
that
there's
two
or
three
layers
sort
of
problematic
layers
with
these
new
smart
speakers
smart
earphones
that
are
in
market
now
borthwick
noted
and
so
the
first
is
from
a
consumer
standpoint
user
standpoint
is
that
these
these
devices
are
being
used
for
what's
it's
hard
to
call
it
anything
but
surveillance
borthwick
added
i
personally
believe
that
you
as
a
user
and
as
somebody
who
likes
technology
who
wants
to
use
technology
that
you
should
have
far
more
rights
about
your
data
usage
than
we
have
today
borthwick
a
former
time
warner
and
aol
executive
also
said
recent
findings
have
indicated
that
apple
is
monitoring
audio
via
siri
and
amazon
is
doing
the
same
via
alexa
alexa
are
you
spying
on
me
alexa
coughs
no
of
course
not
wrong
brian

may
reports
have
also
suggested
that
google
employees
are
listening
to
users
voice
commandsfor
google
assistant
with
facebook
doing
the
same
via
the
messenger
app
following
the
revelations
all
the
companies
have
all
said
they
have
either
stopped
the
practice
or
will
automatically
opt
users
out
of
voice
sample
collection
this
technology
has
led
some
people
to
draw
comparisons
to
george
orwell's
and
a
quote
from
the
book
illustrates
creepy
similarities
the
telescreen
received
and
transmitted
simultaneously
any
sound
winston
made
above
the
level
of
a
very
low
whisper
would
be
picked
up
by
it
moreover
so
long
as
he
remained
within
the
field
of
vision
which
the
metal
plaque
commanded
he
could
be
seen
as
well
as
heard
facebook
recently
announced
the
rollout
of
its
new
portal
smart
speakers
which
it
brags
have
a
camera
that
can
automatically
follow
users
around
the
room
today
we're
excited
to
introduce

fears
the
technology
could
be
exploited
to
spy
