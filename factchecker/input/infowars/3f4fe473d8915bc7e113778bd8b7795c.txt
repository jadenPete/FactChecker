an
electronic
glove
or
e-glove
developed
by
purdue
university
researchers
can
be
worn
over
a
prosthetic
hand
to
provide
humanlike
softness
warmth
appearance
and
sensory
perception
such
as
the
ability
to
sense
pressure
temperature
and
hydration
the
technology
is
published
in
the

edition
of

materials
while
a
conventional
prosthetic
hand
helps
restore
mobility
the
new
e-glove
advances
the
technology
by
offering
the
realistic
human
hand-like
features
in
daily
activities
and
life
roles
with
the
potential
to
improve
their
mental
health
and
wellbeing
by
helping
them
more

lee
an
assistant
professor
in
purdue's
college
of
engineering
in
collaboration
with
other
researchers
at
purdue
the
university
of
georgia
and
the
university
of
texas
worked
on
the
development
of
the
e-glove
technology
we
developed
a
novel
concept
of
the
soft-packaged
sensor-instrumented
e-glove
built
on
a
commercial
nitrile
glove
allowing
it
to
seamlessly
fit
on
arbitrary
hand
shapes
lee
said
the
e-glove
is
configured
with
a
stretchable
form
of
multimodal
sensors
to
collect
various
information
such
as
pressure
temperature
humidity
and
electrophysiological
biosignals
while
simultaneously
providing
realistic
human
hand-like
softness
appearance
and
even
warmth
lee
and
his
team
hope
that
the
appearance
and
capabilities
of
the
e-glove
will
improve
the
well-being
of
prosthetic
hand
users
by
allowing
them
to
feel
more
comfortable
in
social
contexts
the
glove
is
available
in
different
skin
tone
colors
has
lifelike
fingerprints
and
artificial
fingernails
the
prospective
end
user
could
be
any
prosthetic
hand
users
who
have
felt
uncomfortable
wearing
current
prosthetic
hands
especially
in
many
social
contexts
lee
said
the
fabrication
process
of
the
e-glove
is
cost-effective
and
manufacturable
in
high
volume
making
it
an
affordable
option
for
users
unlike
other
emerging
technologies
with
mind
voice
and
muscle
control
embedded
within
the
prosthetic
at
a
high
cost
additionally
these
emerging
technologies
do
not
provide
the
humanlike
features
that
the
e-glove
provides
