at

headquarters
on
wednesday
the
company
has
confirmed
boasting
that
big
tech
and
big
brother
have
developed
a
comprehensive
strategy
to
get
control
of
previous
election-related
vulnerabilities
while
analyzing
and
getting
ahead
of
new
threats
facebook
has
scrambled
to
get
in
front
of
the
election
after
being
blamed
for
trump's
electoral
victory
over
merely
allowing
the
russian
trolls
to
buy
a
bunch
of
ads
most
of
which
appeared
after
the
vote
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
election
but
the
company
insisted
last
week
it
had
tightened
its
rules
for
verifying
purchasers
of
political
ads
for
real
this
time
after
the
contest
showed
they
could
still
be
duped
into
running
obviously-fake
ads
paid
for
by
the
islamic
state
terror
group
and
cambridge
analytica
former
president
dwight
d.
eisenhower
in
his
farewell
address
warned
that
public
policy
could
become
the
captive
of
a
scientific
technological
elite
it
has
now
become
a
reality
aside
from
the
occasional
purge
of
accounts
accused
of
being
linked
to
countries
like
russia
iran
and
china
on
the
us
ever-lengthening
enemies
list
however
it's
hard
to
tell
what
exactly
any
platform
has
done
to
make
itself
immune
to
manipulation
twitter
banned
state-owned
media
from
buying
ads
on
its
platform
last
month
holding
the
move
up
as
a
victory
against
the
dreaded
foreign
meddling
but
its
own
founder's
account
was
hacked
last
week
suggesting
it
has
bigger
security
issues
than
a
few
wrongthink-prone
advertisers
and
google's
potential
to
sway
elections
has
been
the
subject
of
senate
hearings
yet
the
company
has
remained
silent
on
addressing
the
problem
suggesting
it
doesn't
see
it
as
a
bug
at
all
but
a
feature
subsidiary
youtube
meanwhile
conducted
another
round
of
deplatforming
last
month
even
while
declaring
it
was
an
open
platform
for
controversial
ideas
the
electoral
meeting
of
the
minds
came
less
than
a
week
after
the
pentagon's
defense
advanced
projects
research
agency
darpa
declared
war
on
deepfakes
and
other
potentially
discord-sowing
information
promising
to
neutralize
all
malicious
content
within
four
years
if
not
for
this
election
then
certainly
for
the
next
hill
street
studios

until
then
there's
microsoft's
electionguard
software
which
the
company
announced
in
july
it
would
provide
to
all
the
nation's
voting
machines
free
of
charge
out
of
the
goodness
of
its
and
the
pentagon-owned
contractor
that
helped
develop
the
program's
heart
and
if
microsoft's
act
of
selfless
charity
doesn't
convince
a
district
their
democracy
is
worth
protecting
there's
always
cyberdome
the
election
security
nonprofit
advised
by
half
a
dozen
former
intel
agency
heads
who
want
what's
best
for
your
vote
when
they're
not
authorizing
torture
or
warrantless
wiretapping
getting
the
dhs
involved
was
a
nice
touch
too
after
that
agency
was
accused
of
attempting
to
hack
electoral
systems
in
multiple
states
thousands
of
times
during
the
period
surrounding
the
election
unlike
the
russian
hacking
allegations
that
remain
unproven
multiple
officials
from
idaho
georgia
indiana
west
virginia
and
kentucky
claim
the
agency
attempted
to
access
their
systems
after
they
opposed
its
efforts
to
secure
those
systems
after
initially
denying
any
involvement
the
dhs
claimed
the
attempted
breach
alarms
were
set
off
accidentally
during
routine
legitimate
work
the
trump
administration
is
considering
launching
a
social
credit
score-style
system
in
coordination
with
big
tech
that
would
use
spy
data
collected
from
amazon
google
and
apple
devices
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
can
own
a
gun
