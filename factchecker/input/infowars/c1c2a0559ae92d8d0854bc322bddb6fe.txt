of

researchers
from

still
was
not

for
them
a

just
barely

after
all
a

simply
isn't

is

unlimited

on

the
correct
amount
of

of

is
totally
unknown
we're
just
told
it's
a
bigger
number
than
what
is
now
being
spent
but
how
could
a
correct
number
be
known
the
defense
economy
is
socialist
in
the
strict
technical
sense

the
term
defense
services
are
provided
either
by
government
owned

agencies

only
there
is
nothing

economist
mark
hendrickson
who
also
decries
the
recent
budget
deal
as
offering
far
too
little
in
new
spending
sums
up
the
rationale
for
endless
spending
in
two
sentences
you
can
argue
that
the
federal
government
spends
too
much
on
defense
that
is
an
unknowable
except
in
retrospect
but
the
cost
of
spending
too
much
on
defense
is
almost
certainly
less
than
the
cost
of
not
spending
enough
this
sounds
clever
but
it's
not
true
defense
spending
does
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
and
increased
spending
on
defense
isn't
politically
neutral
nor
does
additional
spending
translate
only
to
defensive
capability
held
in
storage

waiting
to
be
brandished
only
when
the
state
is
threatened

national
defense
and
central
planning
by
richard
ebeling
in
practice
when
a
military
force
is
sitting
on
a
huge
pile
of
cash
and
equipment
it
tends
to
use
some
of
these
resources
this
tends
to
increase
paranoia
in
other
states
which
then
launch
reactive
efforts
to
increase
their
own
defense
spending
in
response
to
a
competitor
states
in
the
case
of
the
us
of
course
the
us
has
shown
that
it
is
enthusiastic
about
invading
other
sovereign
states
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
and
when
it
isn't
launching
new
wars
it
is
talking
about
it
as
in
the
cases
of
syria
and
venezuela
even
in
cases
where
full-scale
war
is
averted
as
in
syria
the
us
still
asserts
it
can
violate
local
air
space
and
even
land
troops
within
the
country's
borders
whenever
it
wants
the
case
of
the
us
invasion
of
libya
for
example
is
instructive
in
libya
we
were
told
the
brutality
of
the
qaddafi
regime
required
immediate
military
intervention
without
so
much
as
a
debate
in
congress
fortunately
offensive
military
weapons
were
all
set
to
start
another
us
military
invasion
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
the
operation
of
course
did
nothing
to
enhance
us
defense
nor
did
it
help
ordinary
libyans
the
failure
of
the
invasion
is
now
admitted
even
by
one
of
its
chief
architects
the
hillary
clinton
disciple
samantha
power
who
now
says
we
could
hardly
expect
to
have
a
crystal
ball
when
it
came
to
accurately
predicting
outcomes
in
places
where
the
culture
was
not
our
own
translation
the
war
failed
indeed
the
us's
huge
military
buildup
since
overall
has
not
actually
made
the
us
any
safer
writing
in
march
for
the
new
republic
stephen
wertheim
pointed
out
how
the
new
military
thinking
of
that
time
was
based
on
the
idea
establishing
global
military
primacy
for
the
us
once
this
can
be
done
other
threats
will
wither
away
that
of
course
didn't
happen
then-us
deputy
secretary
of
defense
paul
wolfowitz
and
his
pentagon
colleagues
originally
justified
their
focus
on
primacy
by
claiming
that
it
would
bring
peace
in
a
draft
of
their
report
called
the
defense
planning
guidance
they
argued
that
the
united
states
should
seek
a
preeminence
so
overwhelming
as
to
prevent
any
potential
rival
from
even
aspiring
to
a
larger
regional
or
global
role
after
a
public
outcry
the
final
language
was
softened
but
at
least
policymakers
back
then
felt
some
compunction
to
demonstrate
that
pax
americana
would
live
up
to
its
name
decades
later
the
opposite
has
transpired
america
spends
more
on
defense
than
the
next
seven
countries
combined
with
roughly
bases
ringing
the
globe
yet
its
might
has
not
prevented
china
from
rising
nor
russia
from
asserting
itself
and
may
have
antagonized
both
instead
of
cowing
others
into
peace
primacy
has
plunged
america
into
war
it
has
forced
the
united
states
to
resist
any
significant
retraction
of
its
military
power
lest
it
lose
influence
relative
to
anyone
else
the
endless
wars
are
endless
because
the
united
states
has
appointed
itself
the
world's
indispensable
nation
in
secretary
of
state
madeleine
albright's
formulation
responsible
less
for
ensuring
its
own
safety
than
for
maintaining
its
material
and
moral
privilege
to
police
the
world
the
costs
include
lives
in
afghanistan
and
trillion
for
a
war
on
terror
that
has
stretched
on
since
according
to
brown
university's
costs
of
war
project
it
would
be
nice
if
more
military
spending
could
convince
other
large
states
to
give
up
and
go
home
but
that's
not
how
nationalism
works
thus
contrary
to
hendrickson's
formula
it
turns
out
the
cost
of
too
much
spending
extends
far
beyond
the
mere
dollar
amount
over
the
imaging
correct
amount
of
spending
instead
military
spending
itself
creates
a
need
for
even
more
spending
meanwhile
the
advocates
for
endless
spending
on
new
military
projects
ignore
the
many
economic
costs
military
spending
imposes
on
the
domestic
economy
as
with
all
government
spending
defense
spending
bids
up
the
prices
of
raw
materials
used
in
all
industries
not
just
defense
a
huge
military
makes
steel
for
instance
more
expensive
to
the
private
sector
government
spending
also
hires
away
workers
from
the
private
sector
this
means
engineers
who
might
have
been
working
on
products
designed
to
improve
the
lives
of
ordinary
people
are
instead
busy
building
weapons
that
will
be
used
to
bomb
yet
another
dirt
poor
no-threat
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
then
there
are
the
veterans
themselves
of
course
who
now
will
spend
years
in
and
out
of
filthy
va
hospitals
to
treat
both
physical
and
mental
ailments
brought
on
by
wars
like
the
iraq
war
which
only
served
to
increase
the
power
and
footprint
of
organization
like
al-qaeda
we
have
no
way
of
calculating
the
economic
drag
imposed
on
the
private
sector
over
time
and
this
is
unfortunate
since
economic
power
is
the
most
important
factor
in
determining
long-term
military
power
as
foreign
policy
scholar
john
mueller
noted
in
his
book
atomic
obsession
the
soviets
during
the
cold
war
were
not
primarily
deterred
by
the
size
of
the
us
conventional
military
or
even
by
its
nuclear
arsenal
instead
they
were
deterred
by
the
the
enormous
potential
of
the
american
war
machine
which
existed
not
in
already-made
weapons
but
in
the
form
of
the
world's
largest
economy
in
other
words
the
best
defense
is
a
capitalist
one
in
which
enormous
amounts
of
wealth
make
it
clear
that
the
potential
for
successful
warmaking
is
enormous
or
as
ludwig
von
mises
wrote
in
interventionism
when
the
capitalist
nations
in
time
of
war
give
up
the
industrial
superiority
which
their
economic
system
provides
them
their
power
to
resist
and
their
chances
to
win
are
considerably
reduced
unfortunately
today's
hawks
insist
it
is
now
always
wartime
and
they
demand
the
tax
collectors
expropriate
ever
larger
amounts
of
americans
wealth
in
order
to
carry
out
their
version
of
military
readiness
what
is
the
total
cost
such
such
relentless
spending
on
the
private
sector
we
don't
know
for
sure
and
neither
to
the
hawks
since
they're
the
ones
who
want
more
of
the
taxpayer's
money
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
them
at
the
very
least
however
a
good
place
to
start
is
to
demand
an
end
to
the
us
policy
of
using
its
enormous
military
to
constantly
threaten
invade
and
coerce
foreign
nations
fortunately
a
military
like
that
is
unlikely
to
cost
a
trillion
dollars
per
year
