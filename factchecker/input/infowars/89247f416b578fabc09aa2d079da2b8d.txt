some
of
the
more
bizarre
things
the

is
wasting
money
on
include
the
state

spending

for
the

industry
the
money
will
reportedly
go

aspiring

how

of

paul's
summer
by
senator
rand
paul
on
scribdthe
national
science
foundation
a
government
branch
also
spent
close
to
studying
the
difference
between
frog
mating
calls
in
the
city
and
in
the
forests
in
panama
the
frogs
are
not
even
an
endangered
species
they
just
did
the
study
for
fun
it
found
that
city
frogs
call
at
a
higher
rate
good
to
know
i'm
sure
americans
will
gladly
hand
over
another
half
a
million
lets
see
how
many
frogs
have
turned
gay
this
time
perhaps
the
government
also
spent
a
whopping
million
on
peru's
version
of
the
green
new
deal
with
the
us
agency
for
international
development
committing
the
money
to
develop
new
and
innovative
alliances
with
the
private
sector
that
advance
environmentally-friendly
economic
development
i
e
green
growth
in
peru
helping
out
peruvian
gardeners
has
zero
benefit
for
taxpaying
americans
other
waste
includes
million
to
promote
democracy
in
tunisia
the
report
notes
that
the
us
state
department
has
spent
more
than
billion
on
such
efforts
since
when
things
went
to
shit
in
the
country
why
is
it
working
americans
responsibility
to
fix
a
failed
nation
in
africa
when
their
own
infrastructure
is
crumbling
perhaps
the
most
amusing
example
is
the
much
beloved
department
of
homeland
security
having
spent
more
than
billion
on
an
effort
to
transform
an
abandoned
dc
mental
hospital
into
its
new
hq
with
the
project
no
where
near
completion
there
are
a
slew
