the
new
york
times
gets
slavery
and
capitalism
wrong
yet
again
msm
wages
war
against
nature
when
a
woman
in
wrote
a
new
york
times
magazine
article
on
americans
adopting
ethiopian
children
she
mentioned
my
family
which
has
two
ethiopian
boys
just
before
the
story
was
to
be
printed
someone
from
the
newspaper
called
me
a
fact
checker
who
asked
several
questions
trying
to
ensure
that
the
story
would
be
accurate
and
that
no
wrong
information
would
leak
into
the
account
whatever
commitment
the
nyt
has
had
toward
accuracy
and
truth
however
has
disappeared
into
the
maw
of
modern
identity
politics
from
duke
lacrosse
to
promoting
nancy
maclean's
false
allegations
about
the
nobel-winning
economist
james
buchanan
the
newspaper
has
taken
the
view
that
all
truth
must
fit
within
a
leftist
political
narrative
and
if
the
facts
don't
match
the
narrative
the
paper
doubles
down
in
what
murray
n.
rothbard
once
called
the
progressives
war
with
nature
in
the
opening
sentence
of
his
path-breaking
principles
of
economics
carl
menger
writes
all
things
are
subject
to
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
this
great
principle
knows
no
exception
and
we
would
search
in
vain
in
the
realm
of
experience
for
an
example
to
the
contrary
with
its
highly-publicized
and
controversial
project
the
new
york
times
has
violated
menger's
rule
by
turning
cause-and-effect
upside
down
and
in
the
process
the
paper
dishonestly
rewrites
history
i
have
no
problem
with
taking
a
hard
look
at
the
history
and
long-lasting
effects
that
black
chattel
slavery
has
had
upon
the
united
states
if
we
agree
that
slavery
brought
a
host
of
social
ills
then
the
year
is
significant
to
u.s.
history
as
it
was
when
the
first
africans
who
were
indentured
servants
were
brought
to
jamestown
in
virginia
one
need
not
exaggerate
to
say
that
the
slave
system
which
developed
here
was
hellish
and
there
is
no
sanitizing
or
justifying
it
however
the
nyt
in
its
project
series
has
done
much
more
than
simply
exaggerate
slavery's
effects
on
the
country
instead
the
paper
has
made
outlandish
claims
that
easily
are
shown
to
be
untrue
and
when
someone
points
out
a
falsehood
the
paper's
allies
tweet
out
a
storm
of
abuse
aimed
at
the
truth-telling
heretic
perhaps
the
most
bizarre
claims
are
made
by
princeton
university
sociologist
matthew
desmond
who
declared
that
slavery
was
the
bedrock
of
capitalism
and
that
nearly
every
modern
business
practice
including
double-entry
bookkeeping
is
the
product
of
american
black
chattel
slavery
writes
desmond
slavery
was
undeniably
a
font
of
phenomenal
wealth
by
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
the
mississippi
valley
was
home
to
more
millionaires
per
capita
than
anywhere
else
in
the
united
states
cotton
grown
and
picked
by
enslaved
workers
was
the
nation's
most
valuable
export
the
combined
value
of
enslaved
people
exceeded
that
of
all
the
railroads
and
factories
in
the
nation
new
orleans
boasted
a
denser
concentration
of
banking
capital
than
new
york
city
what
made
the
cotton
economy
boom
in
the
united
states
and
not
in
all
the
other
far-flung
parts
of
the
world
with
climates
and
soil
suitable
to
the
crop
was
our
nation's
unflinching
willingness
to
use
violence
on
nonwhite
people
and
to
exert
its
will
on
seemingly
endless
supplies
of
land
and
labor
given
the
choice
between
modernity
and
barbarism
prosperity
and
poverty
lawfulness
and
cruelty
democracy
and
totalitarianism
america
chose
all
of
the
above
emphasis
mine
while
woke
progressives
would
not
think
desmond's
statement
to
be
even
controversial
it
is
filled
with
untruths
and
thoroughly
violates
menger's
dictum
on
cause-and-effect
the
first
part
of
the
paragraph
is
true
in
that
cotton
was
the
single
most
valuable
export
from
the
united
states
the
greatest
amount
of
tariff
taxes
collected
for
the
u.s.
treasury
came
from
southern
ports
as
cotton
exports
paid
for
importation
of
european
and
british
goods
furthermore
cotton
helped
produce
wealthy
plantation
owners
and
most
of
those
men
owned
slaves
the
following
sentence
however
is
troublesome
on
many
fronts
what
made
the
cotton
economy
boom
in
the
united
states
and
not
in
all
the
other
far-flung
parts
of
the
world
with
climates
and
soil
suitable
to
the
crop
was
our
nation's
unflinching
willingness
to
use
violence
on
nonwhite
people
and
to
exert
its
will
on
seemingly
endless
supplies
of
land
and
labor
this
statement
is
typical
of
modern
historians
and
especially
those
that
identify
with
the
field
called
the
new
history
of
capitalism
which
claims
that
capitalism
as
it
developed
in
the
united
states
owed
its
success
almost
solely
to
slavery
and
brutality
this
is
a
huge
departure
from
how
historians
have
examined
the
rise
and
growth
of
capitalism
as
few
of
them
have
seen
slavery
on
its
own
as
the
primary
source
of
value
in
the
u.s.
economy
writes
robert
murphy
slavery
like
war
is
a
destructive
institution
that
reduces
the
welfare
of
most
people
in
society
though
a
few
beneficiaries
can
profit
from
the
insidious
system
and
thus
have
an
incentive
to
sing
its
blessings
in
examining
desmond's
claim
he
assumes
two
erroneous
things
first
he
insinuates
that
slave
labor
was
more
valuable
than
free
labor
a
contention
that
effectively
is
challenged
by
economists
such
as
murphy
and
vincent
geloso
his
second
contention
is
even
more
dubious
let
me
explain
desmond
assumes
that
americans
succeeded
economically
because
they
were
willing
to
employ
higher
levels
of
violence
than
anyone
else
yet
the
american
south
was
not
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
people
grew
cotton
both
india
and
egypt
were
major
producers
of
cotton
and
one
doubts
that
british
overseers
were
any
more
benevolent
to
indian
and
egyptian
field
workers
than
their
american
counterparts
if
violence
is
the
key
to
creating
wealth
as
desmond
insinuates
then
the
communist
nations
would
have
created
fabulous
amounts
of
wealth
given
that
the
regimes
running
those
countries
controlled
their
labor
forces
even
more
ruthlessly
than
did
american
slave
owners
control
their
own
yet
the
common
denominator
of
communist
countries
is
poverty
and
lots
of
it
another
desmond
claim
also
is
dubious
this
one
speaking
of
seemingly
endless
supplies
of
land
and
labor
while
it
is
true
that
the
usa
had
vast
tracts
of
land
especially
in
the
west
areas
suitable
to
growing
cotton
were
limited
and
improvement
in
crop
yields
did
not
come
from
planters
simply
moving
west
but
rather
they
improved
their
growing
methods
agricultural
labor
in
the
united
states
in
the
antebellum
era
was
quite
scarce
and
one
of
the
justifications
for
slavery
that
the
planters
used
was
that
free
labor
was
too
scarce
to
be
dependable
so
slavery
provided
economic
stability
far
from
being
endless
in
supply
available
labor
was
quite
scarce
and
certainly
scarce
enough
to
help
provide
justification
for
slave
owners
that
were
criticized
for
promoting
the
peculiar
institution
while
slave
owners
did
value
slave
labor
nonetheless
it
is
improper
as
desmond
has
done
to
claim
that
slavery
was
the
source
of
value
as
carl
menger
noted
in
principles
factors
of
production
including
labor
gain
their
value
by
contributing
to
the
creation
of
the
final
product
the
consumption
good
cotton
was
the
product
of
value
and
slave
labor
became
valuable
to
plantation
owners
because
it
was
useful
in
producing
that
good
not
because
slavery
was
intrinsically
valuable
to
better
clarify
this
point
read
the
following
from
greg
timmons
with
cash
crops
of
tobacco
cotton
and
sugar
cane
america's
southern
states
became
the
economic
engine
of
the
burgeoning
nation
their
fuel
of
choice
human
slavery
if
the
confederacy
had
been
a
separate
nation
it
would
have
ranked
as
the
fourth
richest
in
the
world
at
the
start
of
the
civil
war
the
slave
economy
had
been
very
good
to
american
prosperity
if
timmons
contention
was
true
that
slavery
fueled
agricultural
prosperity
then
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
american
farmers
and
business
owners
that
failed
to
use
slave
labor
were
placing
themselves
at
a
disadvantage
which
would
have
made
slavery
more
attractive
relative
to
free
labor
furthermore
as
robert
murphy
has
noted
if
slavery
were
truly
the
fuel
of
southern
agricultural
prosperity
then
one
would
expect
the
value
of
cotton
to
have
fallen
after
the
civil
war
ended
and
slavery
was
abolished
however
murphy
points
out
that
the
cotton
economy
improved
in
the
latter
part
of
the
th
century
relative
to
its
performance
in
antebellum
years
which
would
support
the
thesis
that
free
labor
was
more
competitive
than
slave
labor
even
in
a
region
where
slavery
had
dominated
the
workforce
for
more
than
a
century
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
slavery
was
pervasive
in
american
life
before
the
civil
war
furthermore
slave
labor
was
vital
to
the
success
of
the
southern
plantation
but
it
was
not
exceptional
as
the
new
history
adherent
claim
to
declare
as
desmond
does
that
slavery
was
super-productive
and
that
the
source
of
the
productivity
came
from
beatings
whippings
killings
and
other
atrocities
is
so
ludicrous
on
its
face
as
to
make
one
wonder
why
anyone
takes
the
new
history
school
seriously
had
slavery
not
existed
in
the
usa
one
can
be
sure
that
the
nation's
economic
and
political
development
would
have
been
different
than
what
actually
happened
it
is
doubtful
that
the
plantation
system
as
we
know
it
would
have
developed
especially
in
the
absence
of
available
labor
given
the
farm
economy
at
that
time
was
extremely
labor
intensive
and
the
fact
that
the
labor
situation
in
colonial
america
differed
greatly
from
what
existed
in
great
britain
and
europe
given
that
social
and
cultural
attitudes
toward
slavery
differed
greatly
in
the
s
and
early
s
than
they
do
now
perhaps
it
is
not
surprising
that
landowners
when
faced
with
labor
shortages
turned
to
the
slave
market
while
it
is
difficult
for
modern-day
americans
to
comprehend
those
attitudes
today
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
slavery
was
the
acceptable
norm
in
most
countries
of
the
world
these
facts
do
not
excuse
the
cruelties
of
the
slave
economy
but
they
do
help
us
better
understand
the
economic
conditions
and
the
social
mindset
that
brought
it
about
it
is
one
thing
to
condemn
slavery
and
any
freedom-loving
person
should
do
so
however
it
is
quite
another
to
attribute
things
to
slavery
and
the
american
slave
economy
that
are
untrue
unfortunately
that
is
what
the
country's
newspaper
of
record
has
done
youtube
ceo
susan
wojcicki
said
tuesday
that
it's
more
important
than
ever
for
youtube
to
remain
an
open
platform
just
one
day
after
going
on
a
massive
banning
spree
targeting
right-wingers
for
so-called
hate
speech
