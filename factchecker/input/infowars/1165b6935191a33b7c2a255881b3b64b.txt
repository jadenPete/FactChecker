people
with

have
higher

physical
illness

claim
discovery
puts
chicken
and

conundrum
to
rest
major
depressive
disorder
referred
to
colloquially
as
the
black
dog
has
been
identified
as
a
genetic
cause
for
distinct
diseases
providing
vital
information
to
help
detect
and
manage
high
rates
of
physical
illnesses
in
people
diagnosed
with
depression
assessing
risk
factors
between
depression
and
diseases
a
study
from
the
australian
centre
for
precision
health
at
the
university
of
south
australia
found
a
causal
relationship
between
depression
and
a
range
of
respiratory
heart
and
digestive
diseases
including
asthma
coronary
heart
disease
high
cholesterol
oesophagitis
gastroenteritis
e.
coli
infections
and
urinary
system
disorders
unisa
researcher
anwar
mulugeta
says
understanding
the
relationship
between
depression
and
other
diseases
can
reduce
the
incidence
of
comorbidities
the
presence
of
one
or
more
additional
conditions
occurring
with
a
primary
condition
and
improve
the
lives
of
millions
of
people
worldwide
data
shows
that
people
living
with
serious
mental
diseases
like
depression
have
much
higher
rates
of
physical
illness
than
those
in
the
general
population
mulugeta
says
but
until
now
these
studies
have
been
complicated
by
the
possibility
of
other
confounding
factors
or
even
reverse
causation
where
the
physical
condition
is
assumed
to
cause
depression
this
research
puts
the
chicken
and
egg
conundrum
to
rest
showing
that
depression
causes
disease
rather
than
only
the
other
way
around
importantly
this
research
signals
that
an
individual
diagnosed
with
depression
should
now
also
be
screened
for
a
defined
set
of
possible
comorbidities
enabling
much
better
clinical
management
and
significantly
improved
outcomes

this

was
led
by
professor

hypp

director
of
the
australian
centre
for
precision
health
who
says
appreciating
the
link
between
depression
and
distinct
comorbidities
has
important
implications
for
individuals
practitioners
and
policymakers
today
nearly
half
of
the
population
is
estimated
to
experience
a
mental
health
condition
in
their
lifetime
prof
hypp
nen
says
understanding
the
connections
between
depression
and
other
diseases
is
critical
to
ensure
people
with
depression
receive
the
support
they
require
the
more
we
can
look
at
the
individual
patient
as
a
whole
the
better
their
outcomes
are
likely
to
be
our
results
suggest
that
it
is
important
to
look
beyond
the
obvious
and
that
we
need
to
screen
and
effectively
manage
depression-related
comorbidities
if
we
want
to
minimize
the
longer-term
negative
implications
on
health
it's
also
important
to
focus
on
diet
and
encourage
healthy
lifestyles
in
this
context
it
was
concerning
to
see
that
depression
was
associated
with
multiple
inflammatory
and
even
haemorrhagic
gastro-intestinal
complications
which
may
be
due
to
side
effects
from
medications
used
to
treat
depression
or
even
due
to
the
greater
occurrence
of
e-coli
infections
both
of
which
could
be
prevented
through
this
study
we
provide
critical
evidence
to
help
navigate
the
complexities
of
depression
and
its
comorbidities
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
delivering
customer-centric
treatment

for
people
suffering
