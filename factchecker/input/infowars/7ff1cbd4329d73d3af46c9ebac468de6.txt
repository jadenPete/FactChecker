linked
to

an
extreme
case
of
fussy
or
picky
eating
caused
a
young
patient's
blindness
according
to
a
new
case
report
published
today
in
annals
of
internal
medicine
the
university
of
bristol
researchers
who
examined
the
case
recommend
clinicians
consider
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
in
any
patients
with
unexplained
vision
symptoms
and
poor
diet
regardless
of
bmi
to
avoid
permanent
vision
loss
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
is
a
dysfunction
of
the
optic
nerve
which
is
important
for
vision
the
condition
is
reversible
if
caught
early
but
left
untreated
it
can
lead
to
permanent
structural
damage
to
the
optic
nerve
and
blindness
in
developed
countries
like
the
uk
the
most
common
causes
of
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
are
bowel
problems
or
drugs
that
interfere
with
the
absorption
of
various
important
nutrients
from
the
stomach
purely
dietary
causes
are
less
common
because
food
supply
is
good
but
elsewhere
in
the
world
poverty
war
and
drought
are
linked
to
malnutrition
and
higher
rates
of
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
clinician
scientists

medical
school
and
the
bristol
eye
hospital
examined
the
case
of
a
teenage
patient
who
first
visited
his
gp
complaining
of
tiredness
the
link
between
his
nutritional
status
and
vision
was
not
picked
up
until
much
later
and
by
then
his
visual
impairment
had
become
permanent

alex
jones
breaks
down
how
vaccines
are
used
to
trigger
deadly
amounts
of
fluoride
and
glyphosate
already
present
inside
your
body
to
weaken
the
blood
brain
barrier's
blockade
of
these
killer
chemicals
aside
from
being
a
fussy
eater
the
patient
had
a
normal
bmi
and
height
and
no
visible
signs
of
malnutrition
and
took
no
medications
initial
tests
showed
macrocytic
anemia
and
low
vitamin
b
levels
which
were
treated
with
vitamin
b
injections
and
dietary
advice
when
the
patient
visited
the
gp
a
year
later
hearing
loss
and
vision
symptoms
had
developed
but
no
cause
was
found
by
age
the
patient's
vision
had
progressively
worsened
to
the
point
of
blindness
further
investigation
found
the
patient
had
vitamin
b
deficiency
low
copper
and
selenium
levels
a
high
zinc
level
and
markedly
reduced
vitamin
d
level
and
bone
mineral
density
since
starting
secondary
school
the
patient
had
consumed
a
limited
diet
of
chips
crisps
white
bread
and
some
processed
pork
by
the
time
the
patient's
condition
was
diagnosed
the
patient
had
permanently
impaired
vision
the
researchers
concluded
that
the
patient's
junk
food
diet
and
limited
intake
of
nutritional
vitamins
and
minerals
resulted
in
the
onset
of
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
they
suggest
the
condition
could
become
more
prevalent
in
future
given
the
widespread
consumption
of
junk
food
at
the
expense
of
more
nutritious
options
and
the
rising
popularity
of
veganism
if
the
vegan
diet
is
not
supplemented
appropriately
to
prevent
vitamin
b
deficiency

our

has

impact

life
education
employment
social
interactions
and
mental
health
this
case
highlights
the
impact
of
diet
on
visual
and
physical
health
and
the
fact
that
calorie
intake
and
bmi
are
not
reliable
indicators
of
nutritional
status
the
team
recommends
dietary
history
should
be
part
of
any
routine
clinical
examination
like
asking
about
smoking
and
alcohol
intake
this
may
avoid
a
diagnosis
of
nutritional
optic
neuropathy
being
missed
or
delayed
as
some
associated
visual
loss
can
fully
recover
if
the
nutritional
deficiencies
are
treated
