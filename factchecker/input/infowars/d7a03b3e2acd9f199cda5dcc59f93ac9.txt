at

a
special
initiative
a
statement
from
the
roof
of
the
antwerp
town
hall
flanked
by
a
recently
restored
eagle
dewinter
wrote
on
social
media
dewinter
offered
a
brief
history
lesson
about
the
city
and
its
relationship
with
freedom
amid
centuries
of
warfare
and
violent
chaos
according
to
a
transcription
provided
by
sceptr
this
town
hall
has
been
around
since
dewinter
said
in
those
five
centuries
that
the
town
hall
has
existed
it
was
besieged
set
on
fire
and
has
experienced
countless
revolutions
wars
and
invasions
of
our
city
this
town
hall
symbolises
the
freedom
of
antwerp
it
is
not
without
reason
that
the
office
of
the
mayor
of
antwerp
is
made
of
the
wood
of
the
tree
of
freedom
that
used
to
stand
just
in
front
of
the
town
hall
on
the
grote
markt
freedom
is
the
essence
of
what
the
people
of
antwerp
believe
in
this
city
was
occupied
by
the
romans
the
spaniards
the
french
the
germans
and
today
by
islam
dewinter
concluded
antwerp
today
is
almost
percent
muslim
more
than
half
of
the
schoolchildren
in
primary
urban
education
are
muslim
our
city
has
more
than
mosques
this
must
stop
there
must
be
an
end
to
the
occupation
of
our
city
by
islam
it
is
believed
that
dewinter
may
reached
the
rooftop
by
scaling
scaffolding
currently
erected
at
the
building
for
renovation
work
and
he
could
face
a
fine
for
the
stunt
antwerp
has
been
the
site
of
recent
escalations
of
car
bombings
and
hand
grenade
crimes
which
many
believe
can
be
traced
to
foreign
gangs
operating
in
the
city
in
july
dozens
of
african
migrants
terrorized
an
antwerp
neighborhood
for
hours
when
the
party
they
were
attending
was
shut
down
after
it
had
spiraled
out
of
control
