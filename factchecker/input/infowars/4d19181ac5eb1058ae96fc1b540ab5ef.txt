a
former
trump
campaign
aide
has
dropped
a
lawsuit
against
the
president
after
cellphone
footage
revealed
her
claim
to
be
baseless
alva
johnson
made
headlines
when
she
claimed
that
then-candidate
donald
trump
forcibly
kissed
her
shortly
before
a
campaign
rally
in
tampa
florida
in
august
after
trump's
attorneys
released
a
video
of
the
encounter
however
things
went
sideways
for
johnson
when
us
district
court
judge
william
jung
dismissed
the
complaint
saying
it
amounted
to
a
political
lawsuit
according
to
politico
alva
johnson
a
former
campaign
aide
of
realdonaldtrump
has
filed
a
lawsuit

washington
examiner
dcexaminer
september
jung
offered
to
let
johnson's
lawyers
redraft
the
complaint
however
in
a
wednesday
night
filing
they
announced
the
decision
to
drop
the
lawsuit
while
we
are
disappointed
in
the
result
we
take
some
satisfaction
in
proving
that
alva
was
telling
the
truth
about
what
her
employer
did
to
her
namely
we
uncovered
video
evidence
that
shows
trump
grabbing
alva
by
the
shoulders
pulling
her
in
to
him
and
kissing
her
in
front
of
numerous
co-workers
and
others
wrote
lawyer
hassan
zavareei
unfortunately
that
does
not
appear
to
be
enough
for
our
judge
who
has
expressed
a
very
narrow
view
of
what
constitutes
battery
johnson
meanwhile
said
in
a
statement
i
have
made
the
difficult
decision
not
to
pursue
my
claims
at
this
time
i
am
facing
a
judge
who
openly
questions
whether
the
kiss
is
worthy
of
a
federal
lawsuit
and
has
determined
that
mr
trump's
history
of
such
behavior
is
not
relevant
and
i've
endured
ongoing
threats
to
my
safety
i've
decided
for
the
sake
of
my
family
that
i
will
not
continue
with
the
case
at
this
time
johnson
is
also
dropping
a
separate
claim
that
the
trump
campaign
underpaid
women
and
minority
employees
with
zavareei
once
again
slamming
the
obama-nominated
jung
we
don't
think
we
will
get
a
fair
hearing
from
this
judge
said
zavareei
trump
attorney
charles
harder
said
in
response
to
the
filing
ms
johnson's
court
filing
last
night
giving
up
the
case
represents
total
victory
for
president
trump
and
fully
vindicates
him
of
johnson's
false
accusation
ms
johnson's
filing
last
night
also
fully
vindicates
the
trump
campaign
and
verifies
that
the
trump
campaign
fully
complied
with
all
applicable
laws
as
to
ms
johnson
and
all
of
its
other
employees
harder
had
argued
that
johnson
repeatedly
violated
a
nondisclosure
agreement
in
connection
with
her
work
for
the
trump
campaign
the
president
and
campaign
are
weighing
their
legal
options
against
ms
johnson
at
this
time
and
have
demanded
that
she
reimburse
them
for
the
attorneys
fees
and
costs
they
incurred
in
her
failed
lawsuit
he
said
adding
just
as
the
president
defeated
the
stormy
daniels
lawsuit
and
obtained
an
order
requiring
her
to
pay
his
legal
fees
so
too
should
alva
johnson
reimburse
the
president's
legal
fees
and
costs
incurred
here
interestingly
the
msm
seemed
to
hold
this
credible
accusation
at
arm's
length
perhaps
because
trump
kissing
a
black
woman
would
conflict
with
their
super
racist
president
narrative
or
maybe
because
it
was
obvious
bs
from
the
start
trump
warns
that
a
dem
election
will
crash
the
economy
president
trump
accurately
points
out
that
the
election
of
a
democrat
will
have
serious
negative
ramifications
to
the
market
