the
suicide
rate
in
the
u.s.
has
hit
the
highest
level
in
years
and
there
is
concern
that
it
will
go
much
higher
life
is
an
absolutely
incredible
gift
and
don't
let
anyone
ever
convince
you
that
you
should
end
it
despite
the
fact
that
more
money
is
being
spent
on
suicide
prevention
efforts
than
ever
before
in
our
history
the
suicide
rate
in
the
united
states
continues
to
rise
dramatically
as
you
will
see
below
one
new
study
has
discovered
that
our
suicide
rate
actually
increased
by
percent
between
and
even
though
we
have
the
highest
standard
of
living
that
any
generation
of
americans
has
ever
enjoyed
we
are
an
exceedingly
unhappy
nation
and
we
are
killing
ourselves
in
unprecedented
numbers
this
shouldn't
be
happening
but
unfortunately
the
forces
that
have
taken
over
our
culture
have
convinced
multitudes
of
americans
that
their
lives
are
not
worth
living
any
longer
in
a
culture
where
truth
has
been
abandoned
it
is
easy
for
lies
to
run
rampant
and
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
deception
to
get
someone
to
willingly
choose
to
embrace
suicide
no
matter
what
you
are
going
through
right
now
there
is
always
a
way
to
turn
things
around
and
we
all
have
been
given
lives
worth
living
sadly
the
suicide
rate
in
this
country
has
continued
to
escalate
year
after
year
according
to
the
los
angeles
times
is
the
latest
year
for
which
reliable
statistics
are
available
and
in
that
year
the
u.s.
suicide
rate
hit
a
year
high
these
numbers
come
from
a
new
study
that
was
just
released
and
it
claims
that
our
suicide
rate
actually
increased
by
percent
between
and
the
number
one
issue
with
society
today
is
massive
moral
decline
as
the
lunatic
left
celebrates
trafficked
dead
babies
and
suicide
is
also
a
rapidly
growing
problem
among
our
teens
and
young
adults
as
well
in
fact
suicide
is
now
the
second
leading
cause
of
death
for
americans
from
age
to
age
everyone
goes
through
very
low
times
and
for
many
people
it
can
seem
like
those
low
times
will
never
end
but
when
i
was
at
my
lowest
points
many
years
ago
i
always
had
faith
that
better
days
were
coming
even
though
at
the
time
i
couldn't
even
imagine
the
absolutely
amazing
things
that
were
ahead
for
me
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
we
simply
do
not
know
what
the
future
will
hold
no
matter
how
dark
things
may
seem
to
you
right
now
a
miracle
could
literally
be
right
around
the
corner
this
new
study
that
just
came
out
also
discovered
that
suicide
rates
are
significantly
higher
in
rural
parts
of
the
country
the
quality
of
life
in
rural
areas
is
so
much
nicer
in
so
many
ways
but
there
is
also
a
lot
of
isolation
and
poverty
as
well
humans
are
meant
to
be
social
creatures
and
when
there
aren't
a
lot
of
people
around
that
can
feed
feelings
of
depression
and
if
someone
is
deeply
struggling
with
poverty
it
can
be
difficult
to
see
a
way
out
in
an
area
with
few
economic
opportunities
according
to
brookings
institution
research
analyst
carol
graham
many
americans
living
in
such
areas
see
no
optimism
for
the
future
if
this
is
happening
now
while
economic
conditions
are
still
relatively
stable
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
suicide
rate
during
the
next
major
u.s.
economic
downturn
there
is
never
ever
ever
a
good
reason
for
someone
to
commit
suicide
but
unfortunately
during
the
next
recession
we
are
likely
to
see
the
suicide
rate
rise
substantially
higher
another
factor
that
is
resulting
in
a
higher
rate
of
suicide
in
rural
areas
is
a
lack
of
health
insurance
when
you
are
buried
in
medical
bills
that
you
know
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
pay
it
can
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
envision
brighter
days
ahead
our
healthcare
system
is
deeply
deeply
broken
and
this
is
something
that
i
wrote
about
on
tuesday
it
is
such
a
tragedy
when
people
choose
to
end
their
lives
because
of
financial
circumstances
because
financial
circumstances
are
always
temporary
no
matter
how
bad
things
are
in
your
life
right
now
there
is
always
a
way
to
turn
them
around
the
best
days
of
your
life
could
still
be
ahead
for
you
but
you
have
got
to
be
willing
to
believe
that
this
is
true
life
is
an
absolutely
incredible
gift
and
don't
let
anyone
ever
convince
you
that
you
should
end
it
it
has
been
said
that
life
is
like
a
coin
you
can
spend
it
any
way
that
you
want
but
you
can
only
spend
it
once
i
would
encourage
you
to
spend
it
loving
others
greatly
enjoying
each
day
to
the
fullest
and
doing
something
that
truly
matters
