they've
purged
over

a

comments
in
just

months
after
changing
their

on

they
also
said
they're
using
ai
to
censor
people
for
hate
speech
and
automatically
remove
content
before
it's
even
viewed
from
the
hill
youtube
says
it
has
removed
more
than
k
videos
under
new
hate
speech
rules
youtube
said
tuesday
that
it
has
removed
more
than
videos
marked
as
hate
speech
under
the
platform's
new
policy
against
bigoted
and
supremacist
content
the
video-sharing
giant
said
it
removed
more
than
channels
and
videos
for
violating
its
hate
speech
policy
between
april
and
june
the
month
in
which
the
policy
was
instituted
a
five-time
increase
in
the
number
of
removals
in
the
first
three
months
of
the
year
google-owned
youtube
also
said
it
has
removed
more
than
million
comments
for
hate
speech
double
the
amount
of
removals
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
year
the
spikes
in
removal
numbers
are
in
part
due
to
the
removal
of
older
comments
videos
and
channels
that
were
previously
permitted
youtube
wrote
in
the
post
note
they
banned
thousands
of
people
who
followed
their
rules
to
the
letter
for
violating
the
new
entirely
arbitrary
rules
they
unveiled
in
june
a
new
protected
class
by
youtube
those
now
immune
from
criticism
due
to
their
immigration
status
in
other

youtube

america
has
no

prohibiting

and
courts
have
ruled
repeatedly
that
hate
speech
is
free

that
hasn't
stopped
big

from
censoring
people
for
their
political

using
their
own

definition
a

released
last

called
for
big
tech
to
ban
right-wing
thought
criminals
non-stop
in
a
slow
and
steady
fashion
rather
than
in
one
fell
swoop
to
avoid
inflaming
the
hive
youtube
appears
to
be
following
their
advice
i
reported
on
tuesday
how
the
trump
administration
is
considering
partnering
with
google
amazon
and
apple
in
a
proposal
which
may
use
data
collected
from
in-home
listening
devices
to
rate
americans
with
a
social
credit
score
to
determine
whether
they
can
own

the
war
on
terror
is
being
replaced
with
the
war
on
white
supremacy
as
the
new
excuse
to
take
away
americans
rights
just
as
the
definition
of
terrorism
was
expanded
to
push
through
the
patriot
act
and
spy
on
all
americans
the
definition
of
a
white
supremacist
is
being
expanded
to
justify
implementing
an
authoritarian
censorship
regime
and
a
chinese-style
social
credit
score
to
take
away
the
free
speech
and
gun
rights
of
american
thought
criminals
according
to
the
leading
democrat
presidential
candidates
president
trump
is
a
white
supremacist
and
a
white
nationalist
and
white
nationalists
should
have
their
guns
taken
under
red
flag
laws
and
be
aggressively
prosecuted
by
the
doj
for
their
political
beliefs
today
i
was
asked
whether
the
president
is
a
white
supremacist
i

yes

i
do
look
it
gives
me
to
pleasure
to

this
but
i
think
all
of

suggests
that
we
have
a

who
is
a

august
when
trump
says
he
wants
more

from

but
calls
african
nations
shithole
countries
it
is
very
clear
the
president
is
a
white

this
isn't
only
offensive
to
our

as
we
saw
in

it's

much

to

we're
heading
into
a
very
dark
time
period
in
america
and
everyone
needs
to
prepare
accordingly
one
step
everyone
can
take
immediately
is
to
sign
up
for
alt
tech
sites
like
bitchute
you
can
find
a
list
of
tons
of
censored
channels
here
and
here
and
gab
and
ditch
google
chrome
and
firefox
for
brave
or
iridium
the
censorship
is
only
going
to
get
worse
and
now
is
the
time
to
start
building
up
alternative
platforms
all
these
big
tech
companies
are
sacrificing
their
own
reputations
and
destroying
their
own
platforms
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
shut
down
the
populist-nationalist
spirit
rising
across
the
west
it's
not
going
to
work
because
what
is
driving
this
pleb
revolt
is
the
failures
of
prog-globalismand
the
corruption
of
our
ruling
class
banning
everyone
from
posting
on
facebook
youtube
and
twitter
and
labeling
all
dissenters
as
terrorists
is
only
going
to
expose
the
evils
of
our
ruling
class
even
further
