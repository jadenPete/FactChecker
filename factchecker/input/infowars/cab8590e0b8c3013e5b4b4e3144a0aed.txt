dorian
makes
landfall
in
carolinas
as
pillaging
looting
begins
in
the
bahamas
the
warzone
left
behind
in
the
bahamas
is
getting
worse
by
the
day
despite
being
downgraded
to
category
winds
still
reached
up
to
mph
as
hurricane
dorian
blew
ashore
at
cape
hatteras
making
its
first
landfall
on
the
u.s.
mainland
flooding
homes
in
the
low-lying
ribbon
of
islands
and
throwing
a
scare
into
year-round
residents
who
tried
to
tough
it
out
it's
bad
ann
warner
who
owns
howard's
pub
on
ocracoke
island
said
by
telephone
the
water
came
up
to
the
inside
of
our
bottom
floor
which
has
never
had
water
she
said
a
skylight
blew
out
and
whitecaps
coursed
through
her
front
yard
and
underneath
her
elevated
house
we're
safe
warner
added
but
it's
certainly
a
mess
as
of
this
morning
dorian
was
moving
northeast
at
mph
kph
it
is
expected
to
remain
a
hurricane
as
it
sweeps
up
the
eastern
seaboard
on
friday
and
saturday
far
enough
offshore
that
its
hurricane-force
winds
are
unlikely
to
reach
land
while
the
damage
was
far
less
than
feared
in
many
parts
of
the
carolinas
the
warzone
left
behind
in
the
bahamas
is
getting
worse
by
the
day
there's
just
no
way
everyone's
going
to
get
out
says
a
woman
fleeing
hurricane
dorian
in
the
bahamas
adding
that
people
are
trying
to
shoot
each
other
for
supplies
it's
just
total
devastation
there's
nothing
left
exclaims
one
woman
as
she
tries
to
flee
the
islands
people
are
starting
to
panic
pillaging
looting
trying
to
shoot
people
for
food
as
yahoo
reports
much
of
great
abaco
island
remains
inundated
making
emergency
access
difficult
hundreds
of
boats
smaller
dinghies
and
large
trawlers
lie
on
their
sides
or
flipped
like
pancakes
onto
their
decks
supine
and
abandoned
to
their
fate
by
the
receding
ocean
we're
the
lucky
ones
but
it's
hell
everywhere
says
brian
harvey
a
canadian
trapped
in
the
bahamas
by
the
hurricane
and
desperate
for
a
place
on
a
helicopter
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
man
the
death
toll
has
risen
to
as
ap
reports
the
united
nations
announced
the
purchase
of
eight
tons
of
ready-to-eat
meals
and
said
it
will
provide
satellite
communications
equipment
and
airlift
storage
units
generators
and
prefab
offices
to
set
up
logistics
hubs

a

dropped
off
meals
bottles
of
water
and
more
than
generators
as
well
as

and
flashlights
but
the
situation
remains
very
far
from
hopeful
for
now
people
will
be
out
of

for
months
