lingo
crime-ridden
san
francisco
has
introduced
new
sanitized
language
for
criminals
getting
rid
of
words
such
as
offender
and
addict
while
changing
convicted
felon
to
justice-involved
person
the
board
of
supervisors
adopted
the
changes
last
month
even
as
the
city
reels
from
one
of
the
highest
crime
rates
in
the
country
and
staggering
inequality
exemplified
by
pervasive
homelessness
alongside
silicon
valley
wealth
the
local
officials
say
the
new
language
will
help
change
people's
views
about
those
who
commit
crimes
according
to
the
san
francisco
chronicle
from
now
on
a
convicted
felon
or
an
offender
released
from
custody
will
be
known
as
a
formerly
incarcerated
person
or
a
justice-involved
person
or
just
a
returning
resident
a
juvenile
delinquent
will
now
be
called
a
young
person
with
justice
system
involvement
or
a
young
person
impacted
by
the
juvenile
justice
system
and
drug
addicts
or
substance
abusers
meanwhile
will
become
a
person
with
a
history
of
substance
use
we
don't
want
people
to
be
forever
labeled
for
the
worst
things
that
they
have
done
supervisor
matt
haney
told
the
newspaper
we
want
them
ultimately
to
become
contributing
citizens
and
referring
to
them
as
felons
is
like
a
scarlet
letter
that
they
can
never
get
away
from
actual
criminals
are
saints
but
legal
gun
owners
are
terrorists
this
is
why
red
flag
laws
are
a
terrible
idea
leftists
have
made
it
abundantly
clear
they're
not
interested
in
