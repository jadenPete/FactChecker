take
it
anymore
hong
kongers
are
imitating
howard
beale's
infamous
network
stunt
by
screaming
in
unison
out
of
their
apartment
windows
at
pm
every
night
in
the
movie
the
ranting
tv
news
host
encouraged
his
viewers
to
stick
their
heads
out
of
their
windows
and
yell
i'm
mad
as
hell
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
it
anymore
hong
kong
protesters
who
have
embraced
many
western
tropes
have
been
engaging
in
what
they
call
the
million
scream
for
the
past
three
weeks
during
which
they
scream
protest
slogans
from
their
high
rise
homes
when
the
clock
strikes
the
hour
a
chorus
of
cries
can
be
heard
reverberating
across
districts
with
slogans
popularised
by
pro-democracy
protesters
including
five
demands
not
one
fewer
and
hongkongers
add
oil
echoing
between
high-rises
reports
the
hong
kong
free
press
one
clip
shows
two
students
from
secondary
schools
in
kwai
tsing
shouting
to
each
other
liberate
hong
kong
the
revolution
of
our
times
another
clip
shows
residents
in
the
tai
koo
shing
neighborhood
shouting
add
oil
and
hk
people
a
third
clip
shows
similar
slogans
being
shouted
out
of
huge
apartment
blocks
in
fanling
chief
executive
carrie
lam's
announcement
that
she
would
withdraw
the
extradition
bill
that
sparked
the
protests
was
met
with
scorn
by
the
screamers
who
want
all
five
of
their
protest
demands
met
the
stunt
illustrates
how
hong
kongers
see
their
resistance
to
chinese
rule
not
just
as
an
occasional
protest
activity
but
as
an
intrinsic
part
of
their
daily
lives
i
think
shouting
can
boost
morale
among
protesters
they
can
feel
trust
and
support
within
their
community
said
year-old
teacher
ms
lee
i
felt
very
touched
and
supported
when
i
first
shouted
and
my
neighbours
responded
to
me
though
i
couldn't
locate
them
so
i
continue
to
do
it

beale
would
have
