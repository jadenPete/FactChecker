firefighter
mascot
removed
for
not
being
inclusive
enough
fireman
sam
a
fixture
on
children's
tv
since
s
lincolnshire's
fire
rescue
service
is
dumping
much-loved
cartoon
character
fireman
sam
as
its
official
mascot
because
sam
is
too
male
this
didn't
sit
well
with
a
large
portion
of
the
public
which
is
wondering
who's
next
the
move
followed
a
persistent
campaign
by
various
organizations
and
individuals
that
peddle
the
so-called
woke
ideology
the
trouble
with
the
mascot
was
that
it
was
too
male
and
was
putting
women
off
from
joining
the
force
the
mascot
will
be
replaced
by
in-house
solutions
fire-extinguisher-shaped
characters

filbert
and
penelope
the
fireman
sam
debacle
is
just
one
of
the
latest
illustrating
an
ideological
push
by
the
pc
crowd
to
dominate
almost
all
aspects
of
everyday
life
the
public
outcry
against
the
decision
was
almost
immediate
with
people
pointing
out
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
thing
fireman
sam
works
for
the
fire
service
and
is
called
sam
what
else
do
they
need
to
include
asked
joe
carter
from
lincoln
you
wonder
if
our
fire
chiefs
are
operating
in
the
real
world
the
ridiculous
reasoning
behind
the
axing
of
fireman
sam
was
not
lost
on
social
media
users
much
of
the
reaction
pointed
out
that
attempting
to
shape
a
cartoon
character
into
a
woke
ideological
mold
is
a
step
too
far
one
twitter
user
told
the
woke
crowd
to
get
over
themselves
the
decision
to
axe
the
beloved
mascot
serves
as
a
symbol
of
a
society
slowly
going
mad
an
outraged
netizen
fumed
others
noted
that
for
years
fireman
sam
had
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
a
female
sidekick
named
penny
highlighting
the
apparent
pettiness
of
the
fire
service's
pc
exercise
but
it
was
no
laughing
matter
to
most
with
the
twitterati
speculating
on
the
dreary
fate
of
other
male
cartoon
characters
the
controversial
move
had
its
share
of
supporters
however
the
mascot
change
some
people
mused
would
help
the
lincolnshire
fire
and
rescue
service
attract
more
women
to
its
ranks
estimates
made
in
have
shown
that
only
percent
of
firefighters
in
the
uk
are
women
it
is
however
unclear
how
the
dropping
of
fireman
sam
who
has
been
a
fixture
on
tv
screens
for
more
than
years
will
lead
to
an
increased
female
share
in
the
force
mike
adams
asks
why
conservatives
can't
recognize
the
leftist
call
for
civil
war
the
truth
about
cold
fusion
you
haven't
heard
and
how
to
prepare
for
impending
chaos
