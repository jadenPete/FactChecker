special
is

is

by
the

rotten
tomatoes
initially
gave
the
show
a
rating
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
derail
any
momentum
the
disconnect
between
the
two
scores
highlights
the
gaping
gulf
between
woke
progressives
who
ruthlessly
police
the
entertainment
industry
by
decrying
anything
deemed
offensive
and
ordinary
americans
who
are
tired
of
being
told
what
they're
authorized
to
find
humorous
according
to
vox
chappelle's
show
makes
a
point
of
punching
down
while
the
daily
beast
says
his
jokes
are
problematic
by
cracking
politically
incorrect
jokes
chappelle
isn't
punching
down
he's
punching
up
the
woke
left
which
controls
the
entertainment
industry
uses
minority
groups
as
human
shields
to
denigrate
silence
and
shame
anyone
who
dares
challenge
their
onerous
draconian
attempt
to
police
speech
and
restrict
language
by
making
fun
of
the
sacred
cows
progressives
use
to
socially
engineer
society
chappelle
is
directly
targeting
hysterical
hate
mobs
backed
by
corporate
power
who
are
trying
to
take
over
the
culture
and
turn
comedy
into
a
bland
sanitized
borefest
