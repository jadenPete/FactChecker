bicycle
licenses
are
coming
the

is
obsessed
with
giving
the
nanny
state
more
power
new
york
city
mayor
and
not
so
popular
democrat
primary
presidential
candidate
bill
de
blasio
wants
to
require
you
to
have
a
bicycle
license
as
well
as
a
helmet
to
legally
ride
a
bike
and
promises
to
regulate
cyclists
with
stricter
law
enforcement
de
blasio
and
progressive
allies
have
pushed
new
york
city
towards
redesigning
their
transportation
away
from
fossil
fuel-powered
motor
vehicles
to
formalize
and
codify
a
hierarchy
of
street
use
that
prioritizes
pedestrians
and
cyclists
over
private
cars
bikenyc
however
the
nearly
miles
of
dedicated
lanes
for
cyclists
have
generated
a
spike
in
collisions
involving
cyclists
and
pedestrians
as
well
as
motorists
de
blasio
has
done
little
to
address
the
problem
that
bikers
themselves
pose
until
now
his
solution
more
fines
fees
and
regulations
