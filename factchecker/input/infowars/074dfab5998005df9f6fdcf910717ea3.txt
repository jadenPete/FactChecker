how
slave
owners
pushed
marxist
wage
slavery
and
exploitation
theories
defenders
of
slavery
so
vehemently
opposed
free
labor
they
claimed
the
wage
slavery
system
was
even
worse
than
slave
labor
as
we
noted
earlier
this
week
modern
pundits
are
claiming
modern
american
capitalism
was
built
on
a
foundation
of
antebellum
slavery
the
contention
is
obviously
false
for
no
other
reason
than
the
fact
the
industrial
economy
didn't
skip
a
beat
when
slavery
was
abolished
moreover
even
in
its
day
the
slave
economy
of
the
south
was
never
as
impressive
as
its
supporters
supposed
it
was
cotton
production
was
important
but
northern
farmers
miners
and
factory
workers
would
have
been
fine
without
it
so
overwhelming
is
the
evidence
against
the
idea
that
the
southern
economy
built
american
capitalism
not
even
the
vehemently-anti-capitalist
jacobin
is
willing
to
say
so
it's
interesting
that
modern
anti-capitalists
are
using
the
arguments
of
slave
owners
but
this
really
shouldn't
shock
us
the
slave
powers
opposed
market
economies
overall
and
attempted
to
portray
them
as
morally
inferior
to
the
slave
system
indeed
the
term
wage
slavery
and
its
variants
were
popular
among
slavery's
defenders
who
sought
to
portray
capitalism
as
a
system
more
barbaric
than
the
chattel-slavery
system
of
the
american
slave
states
the
motivation
of
course
should
be
clear
abolitionists
were
attempting
to
portray
slavery
as
immoral
and
incompatible
with
a
decent
society
but
if
the
northern
system
of
wage
labor
could
be
shown
to
be
even
worse
this
would
put
the
abolitionists
in
an
uncomfortable
position
common
to
this
narrative
was
the
contention
that
the
wage
workers
of
england
and
the
northern
us
were
worse
off
than
slaves
in
his
monumental
account
of
american
economic
thought
the
economic
mind
in
american
civilization
historian
joseph
dorfman
notes
how
south
carolinian
poet
and
essayist
louisa
mccord
denounced
de
facto
white
slavery
of
england
and
the
north
as
a
cause
of
starvation
and
deprivation
not
seen
among
slave
populations
meanwhile
senator
james
hammond
in
a
senate
speech
in
succinctly
summarized
the
southern
position
in
telling
the
north
that
its
wage
slaves
were
like
the
black
slaves
the
mudsill
of
society
and
political
government
according
to
the
mudsill
theory
there
is
bound
to
be
some
group
that
does
the
unpleasant
work
that
supports
the
economic
foundation
of
society
and
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
workingmen
are
the
wage
slaves
in
the
north
or
the
negro
slaves
in
the
south
in
this
case
the
pro-slavery
writers
claimed
it
was
actually
the
slave
owners
who
were
in
the
superior
moral
position
because
they
allegedly
took
responsibility
for
their
slaves
as
provided
for
them
in
a
way
not
found
among
the
northern
capitalists
john
c.
calhoun
for
example
contrasted
the
northern
wage
system
with
the
slave
system
which
sounds
nearly
utopian
every
plantation
is
a
little
community
with
the
master
at
its
head
who
concentrates
in
himself
the
united
interests
of
capital
and
labor
of
which
he
is
the
common
representative
these
small
communities
aggregated
make
the
state
in
all
whose
action
labor
and
capital
is
equally
represented
and
perfectly
harmonized
perhaps
the
most
relentless
pro-slavery
critic
of
capitalism
was
george
fitzhugh
in
his
most
famous
work
cannibals
all
or
slaves
without
masters
fitzugh
gets
right
to
the
point
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
first
chapter
we
are
all
north
and
south
engaged
in
the
white
slave
trade
and
he
who
succeeds
best
is
esteemed
most
respectable
it
is
far
more
cruel
than
the
black
slave
trade
because
it
exacts
more
of
its
slaves
and
neither
protects
nor
governs
them
in
other
words
both
north
and
south
employers
who
pay
wages
are
just
as
much
slavers
as
those
who
whip
slaves
on
the
plantation
but
as
with
calhoun
fitzhugh
imagined
that
at
least
the
slaves
were
guaranteed
a
living
and
ensconced
within
a
stable
and
caring
social
environment
t
he
farming
negro
has
double
the
allowance
of
the
english
or
yankee
hireling
and
none
of
his
care
and
anxiety
after
all
in
england
where
the
wage
experiment
had
already
been
tried
for
centuries
by
fitzhugh's
day
the
system
had
in
his
mind
proved
its
total
and
disastrous
failure
fitzhugh
thus
confidently
concludes
there
is
not
one
intelligent
abolitionist
at
the
north
who
does
not
believe
that
slavery
to
capital
in
free
society
is
worse
than
southern
negro
slavery
the
slave
owner-socialist
alliancealthough
advocates
for
slavery
often
fancied
themselves
the
defenders
of
civilization
against
socialists
communists
red
republicans
and
jacobins
they
often
agreed
with
marxists
and
other
socialists
when
it
came
to
critiquing
the
capitalist
wage
system
while
slavery
advocates
of
course
rejected
the
supposed
egalitarian
aspects
of
various
groups
of
socialists
and
communists
all
could
agree
that
capitalist
employers
exploited
their
workers
and
reduced
them
to
a
pitiable
state
of
scratching
out
a
subsistence
while
the
employer
pocketed
all
the
surplus
related
george
fitzhugh
the
honest
socialist
by
chris
calton
the
slavery
defenders
embraced
the
idea
that
wage
workers
are
exploited
be
their
employers
and
fitzhugh
writes
on
how
employers
extract
a
devilish
profit
from
their
workers
while
the
kindly
humanitarian
slave
owners
use
their
surplus
to
make
their
slave
comfortable
as
with
the
labor
activists
and
communists
much
of
the
slave
owner
critique
of
wage
work
relied
on
the
idea
of
bargaining
power
by
this
thinking
many
workers
live
near
a
subsistence
level
and
must
take
whatever
wage
employers
offer
them
so
as
to
starve
to
death
the
employers
can
sit
on
their
capital
and
wait
to
hire
anyone
until
he
agrees
to
take
a
subsistence
wage
that
is
the
employers
has
all
the
bargaining
power
and
the
workers
are
not
really
free
to
reject
a
subsistence-level
wage
in
his
essay
on
labor
movements
in
the
us
alex
gourevitch
summarizes
the
argument
the
workers
assent
but
they
do
not
consent
they
submit
but
do
not
agree
said
george
mcneill
or
as
one
meddlesome
put
it
freedom
of
contract
is
not
free
but
only
seeming
free
the
labor
contract
was
a
seeming
freedom
because
the
worker
though
legally
free
to
sell
or
not
sell
his
labor
was
nonetheless
compelled
to
sell
his
labor
as
one
knight
of
labor
put
it
the
producers
are
slaves
even
the
children
and
women
of
the
american
laborer
are
driven
from
necessity
to
toil
from
dawn
till
night
that
others
may
luxuriate
in
overabundance
the
basic
claim
is
that
wages
never
grow
because
employers
conspire
to
constantly
drive
them
back
down
to
subsistence
levels
for
his
part
fitzhugh
was
sympathetic
to
this
critique
with
its
roots
in
socialist
theory
at
least
according
to
dorfman
fitzhugh
found
that
the
most
extreme
socialists
were
right
in
their
criticism
if
they
would
only
see
that
slavery
was
the
true
answer
so
consistent
on
the
slavery-versus-wages
issue
was
fitzhugh
he
wanted
to
enslave
working
class
whites
as
well
dorfman
notes
how
for
fitzhugh
t
he
ideal
communism
would
be
to
turn
over
the
pauper
whites
in
the
north
at
present
to
the
possessors
of
capital
the
north
must
realize
that
the
masses
require
more
of
protection
and
the
philosophers
more
of
control
or
as
robert
higgs
put
it
true
to
his
sociological
theories
fitzhugh
wanted
to
extend
slavery
in
the
united
states
to
working-class
white
people
for
their
own
good
of
course
the
economic
argument
for
wage
slavery
has
always
been
wrong
as
shown
here
here
and
here
this
is
largely
because
employers
are
motivated
to
expand
production
so
as
to
increase
market
share
they
have
an
incentive
to
increase
worker
productivity
which
brings
higher
wages
and
in
an
economy
with
even
a
reasonable
amount
of
competition
from
other
firms
any
employer
that
makes
a
sizable
profit
by
pocketing
the
workers
surplus
will
face
competition
from
other
employers
who
want
to
get
their
hands
on
some
of
that
pocketed
cash
but
to
do
that
the
competitors
have
to
forego
some
of
it
to
lure
workers
away
this
then
drives
up
wages
moreover
historical
experience
hasn't
supported
the
idea
of
wage
slavery
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
american
growth
historian
robert
gordon
writes
by
compared
to
the
average
nominal
manufacturing
wage
had
increased
by
percent
from
seventeen
cents
per
hour
to
twenty-two
cents
per
hour
which
translated
to
per
day
consider
the
sensation
created
when
henry
ford
announced
early
in
that
henceforth
the
base
wage
in
his
highland
park
factory
would
be
per
day
his
ulterior
motive
was
to
reduce
labor
turnover
combined
with
a
bit
of
altruism
labor
turnover
was
an
endemic
problem
at
the
time
due
in
part
to
the
reliance
of
manufacturing
plants
on
immigration
workers
who
were
not
yet
married
and
planned
to
move
on
to
another
town
whenever
news
came
of
better
wages
of
working
conditions
for
instance
the
superintendent
of
a
mine
in
western
pennsylvania
alleged
that
he
had
hired
workers
in
a
single
year
to
sustain
his
desired
work
force
of
the
fact
that
unskilled
work
in
manufacturing
plants
required
little
or
no
training
made
it
easy
for
immigrant
workers
who
were
dissatisfied
with
one
type
of
work
to
quit
and
move
to
another
town
and
try
something
different
but
if
wage
work
is
wage
slavery
how
could
this
be
by
fitzhugh's
thinking
these
workers
should
all
be
stuck
working
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
subsistence
wage
forever
the
idea
that
workers
would
voluntarily
leave
for
a
higher
wages
somewhere
else
can't
be
true
if
the
wage
system
is
just
another
type
of
slavery
fitzhugh
of
course
was
wrong
as
are
his
intellectual
heirs
who
insist
modern
capitalist
wage
work
is
just
a
new
type
of
slavery
