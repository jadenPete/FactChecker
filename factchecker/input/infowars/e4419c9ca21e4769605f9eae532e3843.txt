the
united

government
has
demanded
that
apple
and

who
are
both
politically
biased
towards
the

the
u.s.
government
is
asking
apple
and
google
to
hand
over
information
on
gun
owners
who
have
a
scope
on
their
rifles
and
use
an
app
called
obsidian
the
obsidian
app
allows
gun
owners
to
get
a
live
stream
take
video
and
calibrate
their
gun
scope
from
an
android
or
iphone
device
according
to
the
report
forbes
reported
that
the
department
of

filed
an
application
for
a
court
order
on
september
the
goal
of
which
is
to
have
information
released
on
obsidian
users
this
would
essentially
impact
about
gun
owners
across
the
ussa
if
you
still
are
delusional
and
somehow
believe
you're
living
in
the
land
of
the
free
think
again
it's
time
to
open
your
eyes
and
see
what
the
u.s.
government
has
become
one
of
the
largest
slave
plantations
on
earth
things
are
getting
ugly
very
quickly
now
folks

that
the
information
is
being

program
says
the
information

means
innocent
people's
personal
data
will
be
released
to
the
government
omanovic
warned
that
the
type
of
orders
sought
by
the
doj
need
to
be
based
on
suspicion
and
be
particularized
but
the
attempt
to
gather
information
from
apple
and
google
is
not
this
is
a
major
invasion
of
privacy
and
a
massive
human
rights
violation
the
u.s.
government
no
longer
has
limits
to
the
extent
they
will
go
to
in
order
to
keep
people
under
its
control
the
country
is
not

from
complete
totalitarianism

the
trump
administration
was
considering
a
proposal
that
would
use
google
amazon
and
apple
to
collect
data
on
users
who
exhibit
characteristics
of
mental
illness
that
could
lead
to
violent
behavior
such
information
would
then
reportedly
be
used
in
decisions
on
who
should
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
buy
possess
firearms
according
to
breitbart
the
daily
caller
cited
a
washington
post
report
that
showed
the
data
collection
would
fall
under
the
auspices
of
a
new
agency
called
the
health

agency
or
harpa
make
no
mistake
the
government
is
coming
for
your
guns

obvious
now
