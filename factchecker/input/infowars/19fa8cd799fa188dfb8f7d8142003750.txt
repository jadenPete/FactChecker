philosopher
warns
linking
human
brains
to
computers
could
lead
to
totalitarian
mind
control
slavoj
zizek
says
the
prospect
is
pretty
horrifying
linking
human
consciousness
to
a
computer
cloud
with
the
capability
of
reading
everyone's
thoughts
simultaneously
could
lead
to
totalitarian
mind
control
warns
philosopher
slavoj
zizek
with
fears
growing
that
artificial
intelligence
will
eventually
dominate
and
maybe
even
exterminate
humanity
zizek
the
senior
researcher
at
the
institute
for
sociology
and
philosophy
at
the
university
of
ljubljana
is
sounding
the
alarm
zizek
pointed
out
that
mit
has
already
developed
a
helmet
that
can
read
your
thoughts
and
reproduce
them
in
writing
or
an
artificial
voice
arnav
kapur
a
student
in
mit's
media
lab
has
developed
a
system
to
surf
the
internet
with
his
mind
he
silently
googled
our
questions
and
heard
the
answers
through
vibrations
transmitted
through
his
skull
and
into
his
inner
ear

while
such
technology
appears
harmless
if
it
is
voluntary
zizek
asks
what
would
happen
if
it
was
deployed
without
you
knowing
it
the
next
step
in
this
utopia
will
be
a
computer
that
can
read
my
thoughts
and
your
thoughts
that
can
connect
us
so
that
we
can
share
our
thoughts
if
you
and
i
are
connected
through
the
same
computer
i
can
literally
participate
in
your
thinking
directly
without
any
external
communication
like
word
typing
he
writes
zizek
said
he
found
the
prospect
of
this
mass
shared
consciousness
pretty
horrifying
because
it
would
totally
destroy
freedom
of
thought
and
individuality
he
provides
two
mundane
examples
of
how
such
technology
would
ruin
basic
human
interaction
all
flirting
will
be
out
i
meet
someone
and
instead
of
all
the
lovely
games
of
erotic
hints
she
can
read
i
want
to
go
to
bed
with
you
and
the
eroticism
will
disappear
another
simple
example
is
everyday
politeness
let's
say
we
know
each
other
but
we
are
not
mega-close
friends
i
see
you
on
the
street
and
say
the
usual
polite
things
like
hello
how
are
you
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
but
if
you
can
read
my
mind
this
is
nonsense
because
this
is
politeness
and
i
do
not
mean
it
usually
i
do
not
care
how
you
feel
as
we
have
previously
documented
futurists
like
ray
kurzweil
have
openly
stated
their
plans
to
achieve
the
singularity
by
uploading
their
brains
to
computers
and
escaping
death
in
his
book
the
age
of
spiritual
machines
kurzweil
made
clear
that
such
technology
will
not
be
available
to
the
general
public
who
will
at
best
live
on
as
a
slave
class
to
the
elite
