temperatures
in
the
pacific
ocean
have
shot
up
to
dangerous
levels
and
scientists
are
blaming
a
strange
anomaly
it
is
being
called
the
pacific
marine
heatwave
of
and
officials
are
warning
that
it
could
have
very
frightening
implications
if
it
does
not
dissipate
soon
it
is
being
called
the
pacific
marine
heatwave
of
and
officials
are
warning
that
it
could
have
very
frightening
implications
if
it
does
not
dissipate
soon
right
now
there
is
a
vast
expanse
of
water
stretching
from
northern
alaska
all
the
way
to
southern
california
where
the
water
temperatures
have
rapidly
risen
to
very
dangerous
levels
in
fact
in
some
spots
the
water
temperature
is
already
as
much
as
degrees
fahrenheit
above
normal
and
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
concern
about
what
will
happen
if
the
water
continues
to
become
even
warmer
at
this
point
things
are
already
so
bad
that
we
are
being
warned
that
this
strange
anomaly
could
ravage
marine
life
and
decimate
commercial
fishing
all
along
the
west
coast
the
following
comes
from
npr
we
are
being
told
that
this
new
anomaly
is
probably
similar
to
another
marine
heatwave
known
as
the
blob
that
made
global
headlines
when
it
struck
the
region
in
and
if
that
is
true
then
things
will
definitely
get
very
uncomfortable
for
marine
life
but
conditions
will
eventually
go
back
to
normal
although
for
the
near
future
we
are
being
warned
that
this
anomaly
is
on
a
trajectory
to
be
as
strong
as
the
prior
event
but
what
if
this
new
anomaly
is
not
being
caused
by
temporary
weather
patterns
normally
ocean
temperatures
take
a
substantial
amount
of
time
to
change
so
dramatically
but
in
this
case
we
have
seen
a
radical
change
in
temperatures
in
just
three
months
could
it
be
possible
that
this
new
anomaly
is
being
caused
by
something
else
this
time
around
we
don't
know
and
most
of
the
experts
are
assuring
us
that
we
don't
have
too
much
to
worry
about
but
the
size
of
this
new
blob
has
already
reached
million
square
miles
and
it
continues
to
expand
at
an
aggressive
pace
the
weeks
ahead
should
tell
us
more
the
previous
blob
dissipated
very
rapidly
once
weather
patterns
shifted
and
hopefully
that
will
happen
to
this
new
anomaly
but
if
ocean
temperatures
remain
elevated
or
go
up
even
higher
that
could
potentially
be
absolutely
devastating
for
marine
life
along
the
west
coast
and
experts
are
already
warning
about
what
could
happen
to
the
salmon
population
and
it
doesn't
take
that
much
of
a
temperature
change
to
put
their
lives
in
jeopardy
the
following
information
comes
from
the
seattle
times
according
to
dr
andrew
leising
this
new
anomaly
is
already
one
of
the
most
significant
events
that
we've
seen
and
it
just
keeps
getting
worse
so
let's
keep
a
close
eye
on
it
to
me
an
image
that
the
noaa
recently
released
certainly
makes
it
look
like
what
we
are
experiencing
in
september
is
significantly
more
severe
than
what
we
experienced
in
september
and
if
ocean
temperatures
continue
to
rise
it
is
inevitable
that
a
lot
of
sea
creatures
will
die
but
if
this
new
anomaly
is
being
caused
by
the
exact
same
thing
that
caused
the
blob
to
appear
in
then
it
could
dissipate
just
as
quickly
and
this
will
just
be
a
relatively
temporary
phenomenon
unfortunately
we
don't
know
if
any
of
that
is
true
at
this
point
and
there
is
definitely
a
possibility
that
this
could
be
just
the
beginning
of
a
truly
catastrophic
event
what
we
do
know
is
that
we
have
seen
bizarre
weather
extremes
all
over
the
world
so
far
in
and
there
has
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
global
seismic
activity
we
live
at
a
time
when
our
planet
is
becoming
increasingly
unstable
and
many
are
extremely
concerned
about
what
is
coming
in
the
years
ahead
we
get
a
tremendous
amount
of
food
out
of
the
oceans
and
so
their
stability
is
of
paramount
importance
if
ocean
temperatures
rise
high
enough
millions
of
fish
will
perish
and
that
will
put
even
more
stress
on
our
increasingly
strained
global
food
supply
so
many
elements
of
the
perfect
storm
are
already
coming
together
and
this
is
yet
another
one
that
we
can
add
to
the
list
