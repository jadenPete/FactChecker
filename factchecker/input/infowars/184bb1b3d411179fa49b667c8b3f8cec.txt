reports
she's
upset
about
the

being
censored
and
she
said
no
one
told
her
that
the
brick
would
be
removed
personalized
bricks
are
scattered
along
the
sidewalk
and
this
program
has
been
around
for
years
the
business
owners
said
they
have
never
known
a
brick
to
cause
this
much
controversy
and
it
all
started
with
chatter
on
social
media
casey
said
she
doesn't
want
her
money
back
she
wants
her
brick
to
be
placed
in
its
original
spot
i
bought
the
brick
a
year
ago
casey
said
of
course
i'm
older
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
here
forever
so
when
he
is
really
growing
up
and
gets
in
his
s
he
can
always
go
back
to
flagler
avenue
and
say
this
is
what
oma
and
i
did
casey
who
came
to
america
as
an
immigrant
sees
the
censorship
of
her
bought
and
paid
for
brick
as
a
violation
of
free
speech
and
an
indication
of
where
the
country
is
headed
i
came
here
because
this
was
a
country
of
the
free
and
the
brave
she
said
it
doesn't
seem
like
we
are
free
anymore
and
if
we
don't
speak
up
against
this
bullying
so
to
speak
we're
not
brave
anymore
either
abc
orlando
covered
the
story
in
the
following
report
over
women
accused
him
and
he's
been
sentenced
to
jail
yet
bill
cosby's
hollywood
star
is
not
being
vandalized
or
protested
as
trump's
was
do
the
liberals
believe
women
or
care
about
survivors
do
they
want
to
protect
children
from
sexual
predators
or
is
their
transgender
agenda
more
important
