desperate
cnn
looks
for
a
new
russia
trump
conspiracy
theory
cia
shuts
it
down
cnn's
narrative
is
simply
false
monday
night
saw
cnn
attempt
to
propagate
a
new
conspiracy
theory
regarding
president
trump
and
russia
however
it
fell
flat
on
its
face
when
the
cia
chimed
in
to
point
out
that
it
was
once
again
total
bullshit
the
network
quoted
the
infamous
anonymous
source
who
claimed
that
the
us
extracted
a
top
spy
out
of
russia
in
because
it
was
worried
about
trump's
carelessness
with
handling
intelligence
fearing
it
could
lead
to
exposure
from
cnn
had
cnn
followed
the
first
rule
of
journalism
and
checked
with
the
intelligence
community
to
confirm
or
deny
the
information
before
reporting
it
would
have
saved
itself
a
lot
of
bother
the
cia's
director
of
public
affairs
brittany
bramell
also
slammed
cnn
in
a
statement
saying
cnn's
narrative
that
the
central
intelligence
agency
makes
life-or-death
decisions
based
on
anything
other
than
objective
analysis
and
sound
collection
is
simply
false
misguided
speculation
that
the
president's
handling
of
our
nation's
most
sensitive
intelligence
which
he
has
access
to
each
and
every
day
drove
an
alleged
exfiltration
operation
is
inaccurate
bramell
added
cnn's
reporting
is
not
only
incorrect
it
has
the
potential
to
put
lives
in
danger
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
also
commented
so
in
summary
cnn
desperate
for
ratings
and
without
a
trump
russia
conspiracy
theory
to
push
anymore
invented
a
new
one
and
pushed
that
fake
news
to
the
detriment
of
us
intelligence
and
potentially
the
lives
of
those
working
in
its
interest
cnn
staff
are
driven
by
a
relentless
blind
deranged
obsession
with
opposing
trump
regardless
of
the
consequences
this
is
not
the
attitude
of
a
serious
news
organization
it's
more
in
line
with
the
behavior
of
the
likes
of
antifa
