two-time
failed
presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton
visited
an
art
exhibition
in
venice
italy
where
she
sat
at
a
mock
resolute
desk
and
read
copies
of
her
emails
that
weren't
wiped
from
her
server
francesco
urbano
ragazzi
the
curatorial
team
of
despar
teatro
italia
said
that
they
didn't
expect
clinton
would
actually
show
up
to
the
hillary
the
hillary
clinton
emails
solo
exhibition
by
kenneth
goldsmith
someone
close
to
mrs
clinton
contacted
us
very
informally
a
few
days
before
her
visit
we
realized
that
it
wasn't
a
joke
only
when
we
saw
the
security
service
inside
the
exhibition
space
at
am
on
tuesday
they
told
huffpost
everybody
was
very
excited
during
clinton's
visit
urbano
ragazzi
said
i
think
the
scene
was
so
extraordinary
that
many
customers
believed
that
she
was
just
a
lookalike
at
first
the
exhibition
is
a
way
to
allude
to
an
alternative
world
that
will
never
exist
we
are
happy
that
the
real
hillary
has
been
part
of
this
image
full
of
possibilities
pretending
to
be
president
aside
the
exhibition
appears
in
part
to
be
a
gaslighting
campaign
aimed
at
discrediting
the
fact
that
of
her
emails
were
purposefully
deleted
the
exhibition
claims
that
for
the
first
time
in
printed
format
clinton's
official
emails
from
her
time
as
secretary
of
state
would
be
publicly
available
but
omitted
the
fact
that
of
her
emails
had
been
permanently
deleted
using
sophisticated
tools
like
bleachbit
the
exhibit
description
says
that
the
pile
of
papers
is
rather
unimpressive
rebutting
trump's
efforts
to
make
them
monumental
in
this
way
goldsmith
creates
an
anti-monument
to
the
folly
of
trump's
heinous
smear
campaign
against
clinton
they
are
just
so
boring
hillary
reportedly
added
the
organizers
of
the
exhibition
claimed
that
the
fact
they
printed
out
of
her
emails
for
patrons
to
read
proves
clinton
did
nothing
wrong
in
the
digital
age
making
these
documents
available
to
everyone
in
a
touchable
format
is
a
way
to
focus
on
something
concrete
in
order
to
exit
the
impalpable
toxicity
of
ideological
narratives
they
said
prosecutor
and
former
sen
trey
gowdy
pointed
out
in
that
clinton's
decision
to
wipe
those
emails
was
likely
criminal
given
she
went
to
great
lengths
to
delete
them
after
they
had
been
subpoenaed
by
congress
she
and
her
lawyers
had
those
emails
deleted
and
they
didn't
just
push
the
delete
button
they
had
them
deleted
where
even
god
can't
read
them
gowdy
said
they
were
using
something
called
bleachbit
you
don't
use
bleachbit
for
yoga
emails
or
bridemaids
emails
when
you're
using
bleachbit
it
is
something
you
really
do
not
want
the
world
to
see
president
trump
has
routinely
brought
up
clinton's
deleted
emails
during
campaign
rallies
and
in
tweets
even
as
recently
as
this
summer
