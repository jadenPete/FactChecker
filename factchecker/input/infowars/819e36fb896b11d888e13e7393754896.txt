death
in
the
philippines
thane
eugene
cesar
died
today
in
the
philippines
compelling
evidence
suggests
that
cesar
murdered
my
father
rfk
jr
wrote
on
june
cesar
an
employee
in
a
classified
section
of
lockheed's
burbank
facility
was
moonlighting
as
a
security
guard
at
the
ambassador
hotel
he
continued
he
had
landed
the
job
about
one
week
earlier
cesar
waited
in
the
pantry
as
my
father
spoke
in
the
ballroom
then
grabbed
my
father
by
the
elbow
and
guided
him
toward
sirhan
see
the
full
post
below
rfk
jr
insinuated
cesar
shot
his
father
in
the
back
four
times
which
corroborates
with
the
coroner's
report
and
said
the
police
have
never
seriously
investigated
cesar's
role
in
his
father's
killing
the
lapd
unit
sus
that
investigated
my
dad's
assassination
was
run
by
active
cia
operatives
they
destroyed
thousands
of
pieces
of
evidence
rfk
jr
stated
the
son
of
the
murdered
political
icon
isn't
the
first
person
to
accuse
cesar
of
delivering
the
death
blows
as
many
have
been
suspicious
that
the
lockheed
employee
was
called
to
work
at
the
last
minute
and
that
he
held
far-right
anti-kennedy
views
however
the
accusation
doesn't
mean
the
jailed-assassin
sirhan
sirhan
didn't
also
shoot
rfk
but
instead
suggests
the
pair
worked
together
both
firing
shots
at
the
democrat
candidate
there
is
even
controversy
over
what
cesar
did
with
the
possible
murder
weapon
as
rfk
jr
wrote
cesar
sold
his
to
a
co-worker
weeks
after
the
assassination
warning
him
that
it
had
been
used
in
a
crime
cesar
lied
to
police
claiming
that
he'd
disposed
of
the
gun
months
before
the
assassination
cesar
and
rfk
jr
were
set
to
meet
in
the
philippines
last
june
but
the
meeting
was
supposedly
canceled
by
cesar's
agent
dan
moldea
rfk's
daughter
kathleen
kennedy
townsend
former
lieutenant
governor
of
maryland
also
believes
the
truth
about
the
assassination
has
yet
to
come
to
light
and
supports
her
brother's
call
for
a
re-opening
of
the
investigation
the
investigation
came
to
a
close
one
year
after
the
assassination
in
after
sirhan
was
convicted
despite
claiming
he
had
no
recollection
of
the
shooting
sirhan
to
this
day
has
no
memory
of
the
assassination
rfk
jr
echoed
having
personally
spoken
with
sirhan
while
he
serves
out
a
life
sentence
at
richard
