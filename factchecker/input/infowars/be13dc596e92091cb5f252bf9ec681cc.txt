serbian
armed
forces
have
reportedly
bought
chinese-built
armed
drones
and
could
receive
the
drones
in
the
coming
months

citing
local
media
reports
and
officials
serbia
is
expected
to
take
delivery
of
nine
chengdu

drones
from
now
until
february
media
reports
in
belgrade
the
capital
of

said

more
stars
and
stripes
said
the
sale
marks
beijing's
most
significant
foray
into
a
continent
where
armed
forces
have
traditionally
relied
on
us
and
european
weapon-makers
earlier
this
year
serbian
president
aleksander
vucic
signed
several
agreements
with
beijing
to
expand
the
belt
and
road
in
the
country
under
the
agreement
china
is
expected
to
construct
new
power
plants
lay
transmission
cables
and
fiber
optics
build
new
railways
and
ports
in
the
country
advancements
in
post-human
evolution
are
being
carried
out
with
impunity
in
china
so
it
becomes
increasingly
clear
why
china
is
beefing
up
the
serbian
military
they
want
to
protect
critical
assets
of
the
belt
and
road
in
the
country
or
at
least
use
the
drones
as
deterrence
against
american
nato
forces
this
sale
will
greatly
strengthen
the
serbian
military
which
will
gain
capabilities
it
has
not
had
in
the
past
serbian
defense
minister
aleksander
vulin
said
in
an
interview
with
state
media
tuesday
belgrade
military
analyst
miroslav
lazanski
said
in
a
tv
interview
that
the
chinese
have
very
good
pilot-less
aircraft
probably
second
only
to
the
united
states
adding
that
they
obviously
copied
some
american
systems
but
chinese
drones
are
very
effective
and
very
cheap
lazanski
also
said
the
cost
of
the
drones
was
an
important
consideration
for
serbia
adding
that
chinese
drones
are
cheaper
than
us
and
offer
top
performance
the
chengdu
pterodactyl-
has
very
similar
characteristics
to
the
us
general
atomics
mq-
predator
and
mq-
reaper
drones
these
drones
have
been
sold
to
asian
african
and
middle
eastern
countries
including
the
united
arab
emirates
nigeria
pakistan
indonesia
kazakhstan
saudi
arabia
uzbekistan
and
egypt
in
an
earlier
report
we
noted
how
chinese
armed
drones
are
ending
up
in
countries
where
the
us
has
placed
weapons
embargoes
this
has
created
a
deadly
network
of
chinese
drones
above
middle
east
battlefields
and
a
chinese
military
strategist
said
drone
technology
in
china
is
comparable
to
the
us
but
lacks
global
market
share
the
chinese
product
now
doesn't
lack
technology
it
only
lacks
market
share
said
song
zhongping
a
chinese
military
strategist
and
former
lecturer
at
the
people's
liberation
army
rocket
force
university
of
engineering
and
the
united
states
restricting
its
arms
exports
is
precisely
what
gives
china
a
great
opportunity
by
exporting
drones
across
the
world
and
with
the
latest
report
now
into
europe
the
chinese
are
rapidly
shrinking
america's
military-industrial
complex's
international
drone
market
share
this
will
not
sit
well
with
us
defense
firms
who
will
continue
to
tell
the
trump
administration
to
pressure
china
so
that
their
market
share
doesn't
continue
to
erode
away
