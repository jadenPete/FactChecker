ministry
of

alive
why
don't
we
hear
much
about
julian
assange
has
there
been
a
well
crafted
smear
campaign

dehumanise

coax
the

dystopian
fiction
the
government's
mission
through
the
ministry
of
truth
is
to
supply
its
people
with
news
entertainment
books
films
plays
and
songs
packed
with
the
information
it
wants
the
people
to
know
it
constructs
lies
to
fit
the
narrative
it
wishes
to
establish
and
sets
about
rewriting
historical
documents
so
they
match
the
constantly
changing
current
party
line
have
we
slept
walked
our
way
into
with
the
curious
witchhunt
of
julian
assange
from
the
time
wikileaks
published
collateral
murder
in
exposing
the
slaying
of
iraqi
civilians
at
the
hands
of
merciless
us
apache
soldiers
in
what
became
the
biggest
news
story
of
its
time
the
united
states
has
wanted
julian
assange
silenced
and
forgotten
he
has
lived
in
a
state
of
confinement
since
may
when
he
was
arrested
and
jailed
in
the
united
kingdom
lived
under
house
arrest
for
a
further
months
in
england
and
then
sought
political
asylum
in
the
ecuadorian
embassy
from
june
yet
many
people
think
assange
was
in
a
position
where
he
could
simply
walk
free
has
there
been
a
well
crafted
smear
campaign
to
dehumanise
assange
and
coax
the
public
into
forgetting
him
how
else
could
he
have
been
detained
within
two
tiny
rooms
devoid
of
sunlight
for
more
than
six
years
without
public
commentary
and
concern
the
apparent
dismantling
of
assange's
character
and
disinformation
has
been
thorough
most
people
do
not
know
the
specifics
of
his
case
but
believe
he
is
an
arrogant
rapist
and
an
ungrateful
badly
behaved
houseguest
smearing
faeces
on
the
embassy
walls
and
being
cruel
to
his
cat
these
disputed
claims
are
now
so
well
accepted
it's
inconceivable
that
they
could
actually
be
lies
the
one
surety
about
assange
was
that
he
did
publish
secret
state
documents
and
videos
embarrassing
yes
but
surely
not
indictable
in
a
country
that
protects
freedom
of
speech
in
its
constitution
never
mind
the
fact
that
assange
is
an
australian
citizen
but
far
from
protecting
him
against
being
tried
for
espionage
in
america
the
morrison
government's
public
statements
have
been
limited
to
assurances
that
he
is
being
treated
like
any
other
citizen
with
ongoing
consular
assistance
are
we
being
served
by
our
free
media
in
its
reportage
of
the
wikileaks
expose
and
the
subsequent
treatment
of
julian
assange
instead
of
seeing
the
democratic
national
committee
dnc
email
leaks
as
important
data
on
presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton
the
prevailing
narrative
by
the
mainstream
media
was
that
wikileaks
handed
the
presidency
to
donald
trump
although
the
voter
count
showed
clinton
had
the
majority
by
just
over
m
votes
and
that
trump's
win
had
more
to
do
with
the
american
electoral
college
system
the
focus
remained
on
the
now
debunked
russiagate
julian
assange
before
his
internet
was
taken
away
in
in
march
the
ecuadorian
government
imposed
new
conditions
on
assange
removing
all
forms
of
communication
and
restricting
his
social
visits
he
was
then
unable
to
do
any
further
work
with
wikileaks
and
had
limited
connection
with
the
outside
world
his
silencing
was
almost
complete
in
april
this
year
ecuador's
illegal
breach
of
assange's
asylum
followed
with
his
immediate
arrest
by
uk
police
and
a
week
sentence
in
a
maximum
security
prison
for
breaching
bail
news
organisations
had
been
alerted
to
assange's
imminent
arrest
by
wikileaks
press
releases
but
these
were
ignored
ironically
the
images
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
man
being
hauled
from
the
embassy
were
supplied
by
only
one
agency
ruptly
a
branch
of
russia
today
without
this
footage
how
might
this
story
have
been
reported
it
appears
the
news
media
is
choosing
not
to
report
much
of
assange's
ongoing
plight
strange
given
he
was
once
feted
for
his
courage
and
innovation
winning
the
sydney
peace
prize
and
one
of
australian
journalism's
coveted
walkley
awards
the
case
against
assange
concerns
the
criminalisation
of
journalism
at
a
time
when
media
organisations
in
his
own
country
are
under
siege
federal
police
raided
the
australian
broadcasting
corporation
in
june
for
reporting
alleged
warcrimes
by

forces

at

of

journalist
annika
smethhurst
over
a
leaked
plan
to
allow
government
spying
on
its
citizens
the
coverage
included
detailed
reporting
of
detectives
rifling
through
her
underwear
drawer
contrast
this
with
the
lack
of
reportage
on
some
important
aspects
of
the
assange
case
in
may
the
united
nations
special
rapporteur
on
torture
nils
melzer
visited
assange
in
belmarsh
prison
producing
a
damning
report
which
was
widely
circulated
but
surprisingly
had
little
impact
mr
melzer's
report
included
this
extraordinary
claim
how
could
such
a
grave
statement
not
have
triggered
further
investigation
and
commentary
other
than
by
independent
journalists
melzer's
horrific
diagnosis
involves
the
life
of
a
western

to

job

us
federal
district
judge
john
koeltl
dismissed
a
dnc
lawsuit
against
wikileaks
emphasizing
the
newsworthiness
of
wikileaks
publishing
activities
describing
them
as
plainly
of
the
type
entitled
to
the
strongest
protection
that
the
first
amendment
offers
even
today
an
online
search
of
reportage
of
this
federal
court
judgement
appears
to
show
an
absence
by
australia's
main
media
outlets
such
as
the
abc
nine
news
media
and
news
corporation
would
it
influence
the
public
perception
of
julian
assange
if
more
knew
a
us
judge
considered
his
work
to
be
worthy
recently
multi-awarding
winning
journalist
mark
davis
gave
an
eyewitness
account
refuting
claims
assange
was
reckless
and
that
he
carelessly
dumped
documents
endangering
the
lives
of
many
instead
he
reported
the
wikileaks
founder
took
great
care
to
redact
and
protect
innocent
people
named
in
the
trove
of
documents
released
as
part
of
the
afghan
war
logs
davis
said
he
considered
assange
acted
with
journalistic
integrity
mark
davis
via
cnlive
where
was
the
mainstream
reportage
of
the
davis
testimony
social
media
posts
of
articles
by
independent
journalists
appear
to
be
the
most
reliable
way
to
keep
up
with
the
unfolding
assange
story
these
are
primarily
shared
within
circles
of
advocates
and
independent
media
which
limits
their
reach
and
sometimes
creates
questions
about
their
accuracy
this
means
the
majority
of
people
wont
know
how
shocked
veteran
australian
journalist
john
pilger
was
after
seeing
assange
in
prison
last
month
they
wont
know
his
health
is
said
to
be
deteriorating
while
confined
to
his
single
cell
for
almost
hours
a
day
nor
will
they
know
that
he
gets
just
two
social
visits
a
month
and
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
prepare
with
his
us
lawyers
for
his
upcoming
extradition
trial
john
pilger
joined
with
musician
roger
waters
to
organise
a
rally
this
week
in
london
to
honour
their
friend
calling
for
the
uk
government
to
resist
the
us
extradition
request
about
people
gathered
in
front
of
the
home
office
to
listen
to
an
emotional
waters
sing
his
hit
song
wish
you
were
here
just
as
julian
assange
couldn't
hear
the
tribute
from
his
cell
at
nearby
belmarsh
the
majority
of
people
did
not
hear
of
this
public
event
the
general
public
will
likely
miss
the
plea
by
gabriel
shipton
assange's
younger
brother
who
read
a
letter
at
the
rally
that
he'd
written
to
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
his
concerns
about
his
brother's
welfare
and
the
pm's
silence
have
largely
gone
unnoticed
by
mainstream
media
more
silencing
more
forgetting
gabriel
shipton
on
september
on
twitter
julian
assange's
name
was
trending
when
people
started
sharing
an
interview
with
celebrity
and
activist
pamela
anderson
anderson
appeared
on
the
american
abc's
long
running
talk
show
the
view
as
she
was
talked
over
and
drilled
for
information
the
former
baywatch
star
kept
her
cool
as
she
schooled
her
fellow
panellists
with
facts
about
assange's
case
and
countered
their
claims
calling
them
smear
and
lies
here
was
a
story
that
combined
celebrity
and
controversy
but
it
has
barely
received
mention
in
the
australian
press
at
a
recent
press
freedom
conference
in
england
special
envoy
for

freedom
amal
clooney
spoke
of
the
alarm
felt
by
journalists
around
the
world
at
the
assange
us
indictments
which
criminalises
common
practices
in
journalism
that
have
long
served
the
public
interest
if
this
is
true
who
are
the
concerned
journalists
and
why
aren't
we
hearing
from
them
not
only
has
the
uk
government
silenced
assange
in
prison
but
the
last
decade
of
his
life
appears
to
have
been
censored
who
is
steering
the
narrative
in
a
near
vacuum
of
information
and
repeated
disinformation
is
there
are
a
modern

ministry
of

behind
the
ongoing

blackout
of
one
of
the
most
influential
and
controversial
people
of
