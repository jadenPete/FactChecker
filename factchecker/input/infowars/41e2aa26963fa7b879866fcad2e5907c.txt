new
forecast
hurricane
dorian
is
going
to
absolutely
hammer
the
east
coast
all
week
long
let
us
pray
that
such
a
disaster
is
put
off
for
as
long
as
possible
and
let
us
also
be
in
prayer
for
those
in
the
bahamas
that
are
suffering
so
much
right
now
this
is
the
worst
natural
disaster
that
the
bahamas
have
ever
seen
for
hour
after
hour
hurricane
dorian
has
remained
almost
stationary
over
the
islands
and
the
devastation
is
immense
power
poles
are
being
snapped
like
twigs
vehicles
are
being
tossed
about
like
toys
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
homes
have
already
been
destroyed
the
good
news
is
that
dorian
is
now
just
a
category
storm
but
the
bad
news
is
that
it
will
continue
to
move
at
a
glacial
pace
for
the
rest
of
this
week
bands
of
heavy
rain
are
already
pummeling
florida
and
the
storm
is
going
to
slowly
crawl
up
the
east
coast
in
the
coming
days
in
fact
according
to
the
latest
projection
the
storm
will
still
be
south
of
washington
d.c.
on
friday
afternoon
and
remember
this
is
just
a
forecast
if
the
track
of
the
storm
deviates
to
the
left
just
a
little
bit
hurricane
dorian
will
actually
make
landfall
somewhere
along
the
east
coast
the
following
is
an
excerpt
from
the
update
that
the
national
hurricane
center
just
released
dorian
remains
nearly
stationary
just
north
of
grand
bahama
island
a
slow
west-northwestward
motion
is
expected
to
resume
overnight
and
continue
into
early
tuesday
a
turn
toward
the
northwest
is
forecast
by
late
tuesday
with
a
northeastward
motion
forecast
to
begin
by
wednesday
night
on
this
track
the
core
of
extremely
dangerous
hurricane
dorian
will
continue
to
pound
grand
bahama
island
into
tuesday
morning
the
hurricane
will
then
move
dangerously
close
to
the
florida
east
coast
late
tuesday
through
wednesday
evening
and
then
move
dangerously
close
to
the
georgia
and
south
carolina
coasts
on
wednesday
night
and
thursday
but
even
if
the
eye
never
makes
landfall
this
storm
will
still
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
communities
all
along
the
east
coast
over
the
course
of
this
upcoming
week
in
fact
evacuation
orders
were
just
issued
for
a
million
more
people
the
governors
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
ordered
at
least
million

to
evacuate

and
headed
for
the

canceled
on
monday
alone
airlines
have
canceled
about
monday

even
though
wind
speeds
have
diminished
a
bit
dorian
remains
an
extremely
dangerous
category
hurricane
and
everyone
should
be
taking
it
very
seriously
just
look
at
what
is
happening
in
the
bahamas
right
now
according
to
the
daily
mail
the
main
airport
is
currently
under
five
feet
of
water
in
the
bahamas
dorian
brought
gusts
of
mph
and
up
to
inches
of

on
sunday
wrecked

international
airport
in

under

water
by
monday
morning
experts
have
also
warned
of
a
possible
storm
surge
that
could
send
destructive
waves
crashing
into
the
coast
dorian
is
the
second-strongest
atlantic
storm
on
record
and
the
joint-strongest
ever
to
make
landfall
after
it
barreled
into
the
bahamas
with
wind
speeds
of
mph
on
sunday
of
course
the
bahamas
have
seen
many
hurricanes
before
but
in
all
this
time
there
has
never
been
a
storm
quite
like
this
before
dorian
its
worst
storm
was
the
bahamas
hurricane
which
passed
by
with
mph
winds
as
a
category
hurricane
andrew
in
also
passed
just
south
of
dorian's
bahamian
landfall
zone
but
wasn't
nearly
as
strong
as
dorian
thousands
of
homes
have
literally
been
swallowed
by
rising
water
and
even
residences
that
are
to
feet
above
sea
level
were
in
danger
of
being
engulfed

september
many
local
residents
were
not
able
to
escape
the
flooding
and
that
included
an
year-old
boy
that
was
the
very
first
reported
fatality
from
the
storm
in
the
end
the
total
death
toll
is
likely
to
be
quite
high
but
that
isn't
stopping
some
idiots
from
going
out
in
the
middle
of
the
storm
and
trying
to
perfrom
ridiculous
stunts
for
social
media
several
videos
posted
on
social
media
have
shown
people
in
the
bahamas
braving
the
dangerous
conditions
during
the
category
hurricane
one
man
shared
a
clip
of
himself
battling
strong
winds
and
being
soaked
by
rain
saying
he
was
miles
away
from
the
eye
and
yet
still
dealing
with
awful
weather
while
footage
thought
to
have
been
filmed
in
marsh
harbour
nassau
the
bahamas
showed
a
man
trying
to
navigate
a
small
boat
in
the
choppy
waters
the
east
coast
is
the
next
target
for
dorian
and
meteorologists
are
telling
us
that
it
will
be
pummeling
the
coastline
all
week
long
and
this
could
potentially
just
be
the
beginning
because
at
this
point
the
national
hurricane
center
is
tracking
four
more
storms
as
hurricane
dorian
approaches
florida
the
national
hurricane
center
is
keeping
track
of
four
potential
tropical
systems
that
could
become
the
next
tropical
depression
and
possibly
tropical
storm
fernand
as
of
a
m
monday
the
most
likely
candidate
is
a
tropical
wave
that
formed
off
africa
that
was
first
investigated
on
friday
is
now
located
miles
west
of
the
cape
verde
islands
it's
moving
northwest
across
the
eastern
tropical
atlantic
ocean
the
hurricane
center
said
so
if
you
live
in
the
southeast
continue
to
get
prepared
because
it
looks
like
this
could
definitely
be
a
september
to
remember
we
live
at
a
time
when
hurricanes
are
getting
bigger
and
more
powerful
than
ever
before
and
scientists
tell
us
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
time
before
a
disaster
even
worse
than
hurricane
katrina
happens
let
us
pray
that
such
a
disaster
is
put
off
for
as
long
as
possible
and
let
us
also
be
in
prayer
for
those
in
the
bahamas
that
are
suffering
so
much
right
now
