valeriya
questioned

with
it
shouldn't
be
like
this
people
with
mental
issues
shouldn't

said
valeriya
we
might
be
lucky
because
he
didn't
have
a
knife
he
didn't
hit
him
with
a
rock
he
didn't
kill
him
as
we
widely
reported
america
and
europe's
societal
and
cultural
fabric
is
deteriorating
as
a
result
of
globalist
propaganda
proliferation
of
drugs
from
mexico
and
china
rise
of
degenerate
lifestyles
and
decline
of
religious
faith
until
democrat
leaders
in
new
york
city
cease
their
war
against
the
police
and
law
and
order
anarchy
in
that
city
will
likely
continue
