the
canadian

for
his
in-home
medical
care
tagert
who
suffered
from
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
als
was
killed
by
assisted
suicide
despite
appealing
to
the
vancouver
coastal
health
patient
care
quality
department
while
tagert's
illness
prevented
him
from
moving
his
body
eating
or
speaking
his
mental
awareness
was
still
intact
because
of
his
condition
doctor's
recommended
tagert
receive
hour
in-home
care
but
vancouver
coastal
health
initially
offered
only
hours
of
care
per
day
they
raised
their
offer
to
hours
per
day
but
tagert
would
still
have
had
to
pay
a
day
for
the
remaining
hours
tagert
then
posted
a
social
media
status
explaining
his
situation
and
criticizing
the
canadian
healthcare
system
grandin

wrote
tagert
in
a
july
post
on
his
facebook
page
so
last
friday
i
officially
submitted
my
medically
assisted
death
paperwork
with
lawyers
and
doctors
everything
in
proper
order
it's
been
over
a
month
since
i
submitted
my
appeal
to
the
vancouver
coastal
health
patient
care
quality
department
they
didn't
even
respond

leaves
behind
an
year-old
son
aidan
of
whom
family
members
said
above
all
else
sean
was
devoted
to
his
son
sean
often
said
that
aidan
was
his
reason
for
living
and
had
a
close
relationship
with
him
right
to
the
end
since
canada
legalized
euthanasia
in
december

one
out
of
every
deaths
has
been
administered
by
a
doctor
in
the
past
infowars
was
one
of
the
only
media
outlets
to
cover
obamacare's
death
panels
where
doctors
would
decide
whether
or
not
to
continue
to
care
for
a
patient
this
tragic
case
will
become
normalized
in
america
if
democrat
politicians
implement
government-run
universal
healthcare
supported
by
nearly
every
one
of
their
presidential
candidates
they
have
a
few
ways
of
stripping
americans
of
their
plans
but
all
mean
the
end
of
your
healthcare
and
the
rise
of
death
panels
