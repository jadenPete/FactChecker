cabrera
mentioned
an
instance
where
two
men
fought
an
agent
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
apprehension
they
actually
fought
for
eight
minutes
and
luckily
the
big
guy
ran
away
but
it
took
eight
minutes
for
someone
to
get
out
there
and
help
luckily
the
agent
was
in
tip-top
shape
and
was
able
to
hold
him
down
until
help
arrived
the
spokesman
said
people
shot
at
u.s.
agents
patrolling
by
boat
in
the
rio
grande
in
august
agents
witnessed
four
individuals
on
the
mexican
side
of
the
riverbank
with
automatic
weapons
fire
over
rounds
at
them
striking
their
boat
on
aug
but
everyone
on
the
boat
was
left
unharmed
according
to
customs
and
border
protection
cbp
the
danger
does
not
always
emanate
from
illegal
aliens
the
mexican
military
detained
and
disarmed
two
u.s.
soldiers
working
in
an
unmarked
cbp
vehicle
in
april
at
the
southern
border
the
incident
was
deemed
a
result
of
confusion
however
president
donald
trump
speculated
the
mexican
soldiers
were
probably
running
a
diversionary
tactic
for
drug
smugglers
wikithis
year's
numbers
appear
to
be
on
par
with
data
for
previous
years
cbp
reported
a
total
of
assaults
against
border
patrol
agents
during
the
fiscal
year
this
was
a
decrease
from
the
assaults
recorded
in
fiscal
year
the
assault
numbers
come
as
the
department
of
homeland
security
is
managing
an
unprecedented
level
of
illegal
immigration
at
the
u.s.
mexico
border
many
of
the
undocumented
aliens
currently
reaching
the
border
are
family
units
who
want
agents
to
catch
them
there
are
still
many
particularly
single
men
who
wish
to
avoid
capture
in
the
attempt
to
reach
the
interior
of
the
u.s.
