september
the
u.n.
just
released
a
study
saying
that
we're
going
to
be
okay
if
the
vast
majority
of
the
world
goes
vegetarian
immediately
yang
said
it's
good
for
the
environment
it's
good
for
your
health
if
you
eat
less
meat
certainly
meat
is
an
extraordinarily
expensive
thing
to
produce
from
an
environmental
sustainability
point
of
view
i
think
it
would
be
healthy
on
both
an
individual
and
societal
level
for
us
to
move
in
that
direction
but
this
is
a
country
where
there
is
a
lot
of
individual
autonomy
so
you
can't
force
people's
eating
choices
on
them
all
you
can
do
is
try
to
shape
our
system
so
that
over
time
we
evolve
in
a
productive
way
former

dwight
d.
eisenhower
in
his
farewell
address
warned
that
public
policy
could
become
the
captive
of
a
scientific
technological
elite
it
has
now
become
a
reality
