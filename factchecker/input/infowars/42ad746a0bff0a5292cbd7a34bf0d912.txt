the
way
sophisticated

work
is
that
they
compromise
a
powerful
person
then
use
the
leverage
they
have
over
them
to
get
them
to
compromise
others
in
their
circles
that
certainly
appears
to
be
the
operation
jeffrey
epstein
and
ghislaine
maxwell
were
running
with
prince
andrew
being
one
of
their
most
high-profile
