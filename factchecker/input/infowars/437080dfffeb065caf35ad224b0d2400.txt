researchers
study
how

works
in
pitch-dark

scientists
link
mammalian
behavior
to
its
underlying
neural
code
new
work
from
finland
has
been
able
to
link
mammalian
behavior
to
its
underlying
neural
code
the
work
examined
how
mammals
brains
interpret
signals
from
the
eyes
at
low
light
levels
the
new
study
shines
light
on
a
route
to
solve
the
two
broad
goals
of
neuroscience
the
first
goal
is
to
read
nerve
signals
and
interpret
what
they
mean
to
our
brains
and
the
second
is
to
work
out
how
our
brain
takes
these
signals
and
decides
what
to
do
predicting
how
we
behave
based
on
what
we
see
secret
to
interpreting
neural
code
found
in
pitch-dark
maze
all
the
information
the
body
sends
to
the
brain
like
what
we
can
see
hear
smell
and
feel
gets
sent
through
nerves
as
electrical
impulses
called
spike
trains
the
rulebook
for
how
the
brain
decodes
spike
trains
is
unknown
and
working
it
out
is
made
harder
by
the
fact
that
the
nervous
system
often
carries
the
same
message
in
many
different
ways
when
the
different
versions
of
the
same
message
reach
the
brain
it
interprets
all
these
signals
together
to
decide
how
to
behave
professor
petri
ala-laurila
and
his
teams
at
aalto
university
and
the
university
of
helsinki
have
now
been
able
to
link
behaviour
in
a
mouse
to
specific
spike-trains
originating
in
its
eyes
the
mice
had
been
trained
swim
towards
an
extremely
faint
light
in
a
pitch-dark
maze
and
the
team
measured
how
effective
the
mice
were
at
finding
it
darkness
had
to
be
used
because
it
critically
reduces
the
number
of
relevant
spike
trains
to
the
two
most
sensitive
ones
to
dim
light
one
called
the
on
channel
and
one
called
the
off
channel
by
creating
a
scenario
where
there
are
a
limited
number
of
spike
trains
getting
sent
for
a
specific
input
the
team
were
able
to
isolate
which
individual
spike
train
controlled
behaviour
it
is
very
difficult
to
carry
out
precise
science
experiments
in
complete
darkness
so
the
team
developed
a
unique
repertoire
of
state-of-the-art
techniques
they
had
to
design
ways
to
measure
electrical
signals
originating
from
single
photons
through
the
neural
tissue
of
the
eye
the
retina
and
linked
these
signals
to
mouse
behavior
in
the
maze
one
of
the
breakthroughs
is
that
the
team
can
track
mice
in
the
dark
using
night-vision
cameras
and
their
deep-learning
based
software
so
accurately
that
they
are
able
to
predict
with
unprecedented
resolution
where
photons
land
on
each
mouse's
retinas
fda
relying
on
companies
to
police
themselves
the
light
the
mouse
was
trying
to
find
was
made
dimmer
each
time
to
the
point
that
in
the
last
few
attempts
only
a
few
photons
at
a
time
were
entering
the
mouse's
eyes
the
team
compared
two
types
of
mice
the
first
group
of
mice
that
did
the
task
were
ordinary
laboratory
mice
the
second
group
had
been
genetically
modified
so
that
their
most
sensitive
on
channel
needs
times
more
light
to
send
a
spike
train
than
the
most
sensitive
off
channel
these
modified
mice
turned
out
to
be
times
worse
at
seeing
the
light
than
their
unmodified
cousins
therefore
the
researchers
were
able
to
prove
their
important
discovery
individual
spike
trains
going
through
the
on
channel
were
responsible
for
the
mouse
seeing
the
light
result
relevant
to
all
neuroscientists
studying
perception
this
result
is
the
first
time
anyone
has
linked
visual
behavior
with
this
resolution
to
precise
spike-codes
coming
from
the
retina
this
is
like
trying
to
translate
a
language
professor
petri
ala-laurila
explains
previously
we
were
using
a
phrasebook
we
knew
what
whole
sentences
meant
but
not
the
meaning
of
individual
words
now
that
we
can
link
precise
codes
consisting
of
individual
nerve
impulses
to
behavior
we
are
getting
closer
to
understanding
individual
words
the
result
is
highly
relevant
to
researchers
working
on
vision
but
also
broadly
relevant
to
all
neuroscientists
working
on
perception
because
of
a
surprising
aspect
of
the
result
that
overturned
previously
held
beliefs
in
neurology
for
years
researchers
have
been
using
information
theory
to
model
how
the
brain
handles
different
signals
one
of
the
assumptions
was
that
if
the
brain
has
to
choose
between
two
competing
codes
it
will
rely
on
the
signal
that
contains
more
information
in
the
case
of
the
on
and
off
channels
in
vision
in
the
genetically
modified
mice
the
on
channel
which
the
team
showed
was
key
in
controlling
behavior
contains
less
information
the
on
channel
increases
the
amount
of
nerve
impulses
it
sends
to
the
brain
when
it
detects
photons
whereas
the
off
channel
decreases
its
impulse
rate
and
the
researchers
show
that
behaviour
relies
only
on
messages
that
are
encoded
in
increased
impulse
rate
rather
than
decreased
impulse
rate
this
discovery
is
really
exciting
for
all
of
neuroscience
because
it's
experimental
proof
of
the
brain
prioritizing
information
encoded
in
spikes
rather
than
in
the
absence
of
spikes
says
lina
smeds
the
phd
student
at
university
of
helsinki
who
is
first
author
of
the
paper
the
next
steps
for
the
finnish
groups
are
to
measure
if
the
same
principles
apply
to
more
neural
circuits
and
behavioral
paradigms
and
to
see
if
they
also
follow
the
same
rules
professor
ala-laurila
compares
the
discovery
to
that
of
the
rosetta
stone
in
terms
of
its
applicability
when
the
rosetta
stone
was
discovered
it
didn't
mean
we
could
immediately
understand
ancient
egyptian
but
it
gave
researchers
a
tool
that
they
used
over
the
next
decades
to
finally
translate
hieroglyphics
likewise
this
discovery
doesn't
mean
we
can
immediately
predict
behavior
from
sensory
nerve
signals
but
it
will
mean
we
can
now
start
to
study
what
individual
signals
mean
to
the
brain
