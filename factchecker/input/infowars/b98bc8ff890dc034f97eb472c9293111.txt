vows
to
further
breach
nuclear
limits
president
rouhani
slams
us
sanctions
on
iran's
space
agency
iran's
president
hassan
rouhani
said
on
tuesday
he's
ruled
out
any
bilateral
talks
with
the
us
in
an
address
to
iranian
parliament
he
said
the
country
is
opposed
to
such
negotiations
in
principle
given
it
was
the
trump
white
house
that
pulled
out
of
the
jcpoa
and
tore
up
its
prior
commitments
crucially
he
also
affirmed
that
iran
is
moving
forward
with
reducing
its
own
commitments
to
the
terms
of
the
nuclear
deal
for
the
third
time
in
the
coming
days
iran
this
summer
blew
past
uranium
enrichment
levels
previously
agreed
to
under
the
terms
of
the
jcpoa
citing
crippling
and
aggressive
us-led
sanctions

joel
skousen
joins
alex
via
skype
to
break
down
why
president
trump
must
act
wisely
to
avoid
global
catastrophe
rouhani
responded
to
widespread
media
reports
in
the
wake
of
the
g
summit
in
france
that
iran
and
the
trump
administration
could
soon
hold
direct
talks
and
after
trump
himself
last
week
signaled
openness
to
resumption
of
negotiations
maybe
there
has
been
a
misunderstanding
we've
said
it
several
times
and
we
repeat
it
there
has
been
no
decision
to
hold
bilateral
talks
with
the
us
said
rouhani
in
principle
we
don't
want
bilateral
talks
with
the
united
states
he
added
if
the
united
states
lifts
all
sanctions
it
would
be
possible
to
talk
with
them
during
meetings
as
in
the
past
he
said
this
doesn't
appear
at
all
likely
given
the
us
on
tuesday
afternoon
issued
fresh
sanctions
targeting
iran's
space
agency
space
research
center
and
astronautics
research
institute
according
a
statement
on
the
us
treasury
website
as
the
associated
press
summarized
of
the
newly
unveiled
sanctions
the
sanctions
announced
by
the
state
and
treasury
departments
targeting
the
agency
and
two
of
its
affiliates
follow
the
explosion
thursday
of
a
rocket
at
iran's
imam
khomeini
space
center
in
what
an
iranian
official
said
was
a
technical
malfunction
during
a
test
the
explosion
prompted
president
donald
trump
to
tweet
a
surveillance
image
depicting
the
apparent
aftermath
of
the
incident
and
declare
that
the
u.s.
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
transpired
at
the
launch
site

sanctions
on

september
but
rouhani
also
seemed
to
give
a
positive
nod
to
french
efforts
at
establishing
a
billion
line
of
credit
in
return
for
tehran
reversing
its
current
uranium
enrichment
levels
if
europeans
can
purchase
our
oil
or
pre-purchase
it
and
we
can
have
access
to
our
money
that
will
ease
the
situation
and
we
can
fully
implement
the
deal
otherwise
we
will
take
our
third
step
he
warned
president
macron
is
making
a
last-ditch
effort
to
create
conditions
to
bring
tehran
and
washington
back
to
the
nuclear
negotiating
table
by
offering
iran
a
billion
credit
line
and
alternative
trade
mechanism
as
an
incentive
to
come
back
into
compliance
with
the
nuclear
deal
iran's
top
diplomat
fm
zarif
was
said
to
be
open
to
it
when
it
was
first
raised
in
biarritz
france
over
a
week
ago
but
the
plan's
progress
is
now
conditioned
on
whether
the
white
house
rejects
it
a
us
decision
is
expected
in
the
coming
days
rouhani's
address
seemed
set
up
as
a
warning
related
to
macron's
initiative
that
puts
the
ball
firmly
in
washington's
court
we
are
witnessing

reese

their
accounts
of

hong
kong
protests

the
hopes
of
bringing
attention
to
the
plight
of
a
people
facing-down
true
tyranny
