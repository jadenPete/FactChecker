democratic
presidential
candidate
elizabeth
warren
responded
to
a
question
about
struggling
families
dependent
on
oil
jobs
by
suggesting
they
find
other
work
cnn
climate
correspondent
bill
weir
asked
the
massachusetts
senator
about
families
whose
jobs
depend
on
the
biggest
oil
refinery
in
north
america
located
in
port
arthur
texas
it
is
in
port
arthur
but
it's
owned
by
a
saudi
arabian
company
that
made
more
profit
twice
as
much
profit
as
apple
computers
last
year
although
right
next
door
i
met
a
family
in
a
house
that
can't
afford
to
fix
the
mold
from
harvey
even
though
they
understand
the
problems
they
would
tell
you
please
don't
shut
them
down
because
i
will
die
of
starvation
before
i
die
of
pollution
weir
told
warren
during
cnn's
seven-hour
climate
town
hall
on
wednesday
they're
worried
about
jobs
and
so
what
do
you
tell
the
pipe
fitters
and
cafeteria
workers
in
port
arthur
what
will
happen
to
them
if
these
places
go
dark
he
continued
so
i
would
say
two
things
to
them
the
first
one
is
that's
not
the
only
job
in
port
arthur
over
the
next
years
i've
seen
port
arthur
port
arthur
is
going
to
need
a
lot
of
infrastructure
re-building
and
strengthening
it's
going
to
need
a
lot
of
help
right
on
the
water
warren
responded
those
are
good
jobs
those
are
union
jobs
those
are
skilled
jobs
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
and
i
hope
the
workers
in
port
arthur
will
be
a
big
part
of
that
she
continued
warren
followed
by
blaming
corruption
in
washington
for
climate
change
these
changes
are
no
longer
optional
they're
no
longer
there
as
a
maybe
yes
maybe
no

the
communist
chinese
secret
weapon
