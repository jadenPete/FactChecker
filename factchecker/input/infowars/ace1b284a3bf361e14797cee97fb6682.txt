beto
steals
mass
shooting
spotlight
again
unpopular
candidate
politicizing
tragedy
again
to
regain
relevancy
yet
another
mass
shooting
was
immediately
politicized
by
beto
o'rourke
this
time
in
odessa
and
midland
texas
over
the
weekend
with
reported
dead
and
injured
like
an
ambulance
chaser
if
there
is
a
mass
shooting
in
texas
you
can
guarantee
beto
o'rourke
will
be
there
to
grab
the
national
spotlight
before
all
of
the
information
is
in
and
the
families
have
had
time
to
heal
in
an
interview
with
the
dallas
morning
news
pastor
frank
pomeroy
of
the
first
baptist
church
of
sutherland
springs
where
a
mass
shooting
took
the
lives
of
people
including
his
daughter
pomeroy
said
he
was
angered
by
the
response
of
some
politicians
to
the
recent
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
he
specifically
mentioned
beto
o'rourke
saying
the
former
el
paso
congressman
and
current
presidential
candidate
politicized
the
event
rather
than
putting
their
political
ideologies
aside
for
a
while
they
turn
people
into
political
pawns
pomeroy
said
that
wasn't
the
time
in
my
mind
those
people
need
grace
they
needed
hands
they
needed
hugs
but
that
isn't
stopping
beto
he
is
making
the
rounds
on
liberal
msm
less
than
hours
after
the
shooting
of
course
what
beto
will
not
face
is
that
it's
becoming
obvious
that
the
only
recourse
against
this
wave
of
mass
shooters
is
to
exercise
our
second
amendment
rights
as
the
democrats
gun-free
zones
have
been
the
go-to
hunting
grounds
for
roughly
of
mass
shootings
since
all
gun
debating
aside
why
is
it
that
we
are
lead
to
believe
that
a
wave
of
white
nationalism
is
behind
all
of
the
mass
shootings
anybody
can
see
there
are
a
variety
of
faces
on
this
graphic
of
mass
shooters
not
to
mention
that
there
was
a
mass
shooting
in
alabama
between
black
folks
the
day
before
odessa
that
was
completely
ignored
by
mainstream
media
and
at
least
of
the
mass
shootings
in
have
been
in
chicago
because
it
doesn't
fit
their
divide-and-conquer
narrative
the
only
feasible
reason
for
the
dangerous
pattern
of
propaganda
is
that
the
democrats
are
fomenting
a
divide
so
deep
that
they
will
bring
order
out
of
chaos
through
a
manufactured
race
war
that
no
real
american
wants
