the
spiritual
collapse
of
society
leads
to
the
fall
of
civilization
as
people
worry
about
economic
downturn
real
threat
to
western
world
is
actually
dissolution
of
nuclear
families
while
americans
worry
about
an
economic
collapse
a
more
insidious
problem
threatens
western
civilization
the
dissolution
of
spiritual
and
social
cohesion
the
globalist
corporate
model
of
consumerism
degeneracy
nihilism
and
abandonment
of
homogenous
cultural
and
religious
values
has
led
the
world
into
a
state
of
despair
complacency
violence
and
dysfunction
likewise
the
establishment's
push
for
cultural
relativism
has
resulted
in
an
acceptance
for
barbarism
random
and
senseless
violence
disregard
for
human
life
and
open
borders
for
example
shia
islamists
in
the
middle
east
bloodletted
their
own
children's
heads
with
knives
to
commemorate
the
prophet
muhammad's
grandson
despite
the
fact
self-harm
is
forbidden
in
islam
not
a
peep
from
the
woke
left
who
pretend
to
champion
human
rights
random
acts
of
violence
in
america
and
europe
have
been
increasing
in
recent
years
as
social
cohesion
continued
to
dissolve
in
the
modern
culture
through
globalist
influence
in
technology
propaganda
drug
trafficking
and
government
policy
the
dominant
culture
is
doing
away
with
spirituality
and
institutional
religions
replacing
them
with
collectivism
and
worship
of
government
which
is
antithetical
to
the
nuclear
family
because
the
family
threatens
the
power
of
the
state
in
their
quest
to
devalue
human
life
the
corporate
culture
has
also
elevated
late-term
and
even
post-birth
abortions
as
central
woke
issues
for
the
far-left
garnering
support
from
states
like
new
york
illinois
and
virginia
and
for
good
measure
the
globalists
are
also
using
divide-and-conquer
tactics
through
the
media
to
alienate
men
corrupt
women
and
pit
races
and
classes
against
each
other
to
ensure
the
complete
spiritual
destruction
of
the
west
for
their
one
world
government
takeover
hard
data
shows
that
the
path
we've
been
taking
as
a
modern
society
into
the
st
century
is
the
incorrect
one
because
from
to
the
suicide
rate
of
americans
ages
to
jumped
with
hard
drugs
hopelessness
and
social
alienation
as
prominent
factors
fortunately
some
people
see
the
planned
destruction
of
society
by
the
globalists
and
are
taking
action
such
as
getting
more
involved
with
their
communities
churches
and
families
