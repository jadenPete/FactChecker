politifact
points
out
politifact
recently
rated
a
photo
showing
joe
biden
associating
with
former
kkk
leader
robert
byrd
mostly
false
in
one
of
the
most
obvious
attempts
to
keep
the
democrat
frontrunner
clean
of
scandals
the
reason
it
was
rated
mostly
false
because
the
meme
circulating
on
facebook
got
byrd's
official
title
wrong
he
wasn't
a
grand
wizard
he
was
an
exalted
cyclops
the
facebook
post
shared
by
enlisted
nine
fight
company
veteran
apparel
shows
joe
biden
smiling
and
raising
a
fist
as
he
lifts
byrd's
right
hand
with
text
reading
biden
with
grand
wizard
of
kkk
so
who
again
is
playing
you
lying
to
you
using
you
for
the
votes
creators
of
the
kkk
opposed
civil
right
of
blacks
yup
thats
the
democratic
party
in
their
explanation
politifact
admits
the
picture
is
an
actual
ap
photograph
from
biden's
run
with
barack
obama
but
then
goes
to
great
lengths
to
explain
the
difference
between
kkk
grand
wizards
and
exalted
cyclopses
as
if
that
helps
in
west
virginia
in
the
s
late
or
early
according
to
byrd's
memoir
he
organized
and
led
a
member
chapter
or
klavern
of
the
klan
as
the
exalted
cyclops
in
klan
hierarchy
according
to
slate
each
klavern
is
led
by
an
exalted
cyclops
typically
elected
by
his
fellow
klansmen
the
exalted
cyclops
reports
to
a
grand
giant
provincial
leader
grand
dragon
state
director
and
grand
wizard
national
chair
politifact
even
highlights
past
racist
statements
made
by
byrd
including
one
letter
in
which
he
wrote
to
a
grand
wizard
the
klan
is
needed
today
as
never
before
and
i
am
anxious
to
see
its
rebirth
here
in
west
virginia
and
another
letter
from
he
sent
to
a
fellow
democrat
in
which
he
wrote
rather
i
should
die
a
thousand
times
and
see
old
glory
trampled
in
the
dirt
never
to
rise
again
than
to
see
this
beloved
land
of
ours
become
degraded
by
race
mongrels
despite
all
that
politifact
reasoned
the
meme
was
mostly
false
because
it
exaggerates
byrd's
role
in
the
kkk
and
because
he
was
largely
repentant
and
remorseful
of
his
past
transgression
in
the
s
byrd
organized
and
led
a
local
klan
chapter
as
its
exalted
cyclops
but
he
wasn't
a
grand
wizard
and
he
ultimately
renounced
his
views
from
that
period
of
his
life
though
his
past
and
former
ties
to
the
kkk
were
raised
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life
by
the
time
this
photo
of
byrd
and
biden
was
taken
byrd's
public
expressions
of
regret
and
shame
over
his
earlier
involvement
in
the
kkk
was
well-documented
and
often-repeated
we
rate
this
facebook
post
mostly
false
keep
in
mind
politifact
