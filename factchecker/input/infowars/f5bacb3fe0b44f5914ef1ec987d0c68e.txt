bryan
was
quickly
hit
with
a
code
violation
for
unsportsmanlike
conduct
which
he
contested
on
the
court
just
tell
me
what
i
did
real
quick
what
was
the
gesture
he
asked
chair
umpire
mariana
alves
responded
the
gesture
that
you
did
you
did
it
to
the
line
umpire
and
did
it
to
me
you
did
with
your
racket
like
it
was
a
gun
i
don't
think
that
was
appropriate
the
u.s.

association
usta
later
fined
bryan
for
the
gesture
which
has
been
called
insensitive
and
poorly
timed
by
critics
and
mainstream
media
in
the
wake
of
recent
mass
shootings
one
of
which
had
taken
place
hours
earlier
in
texas
we
thought
it
warranted
that
amount
said
usta
spokesman
brendan
mcintyre
bryan
has
since
apologized
profusely
for
the
move
saying
we
won
the
point
and
the
gesture
was
meant
to
be
playful
but
given
the
recent
news
and
political
climate
i
understand
how
my
gesture
could
be
viewed
as
insensitive
i
promise
that
i
will
never
do
anything
like
this
again
