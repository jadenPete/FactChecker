swedish

derived
from
dead

might
save
the
human
race
few
topics
cause
more
intense
feelings
of
revulsion
than
cannibalism
and
rightly
so
the
consumption
of
human
flesh
has
always
been
considered
abhorrent
vile
and
to
most
morally
wrong
however
a
swedish
scientist
speaking
at
a
stockholm
summit
of
libtards
and
local
illuminati
last
week
offered
cannibalism
as
a
possible
tactic
to
combat
global
climate
change
unveiling
publicly
for
the
first
time
the
fixation
of
the
mondialists
with
cannibalism
stockholm
school
of
economics
professor
and
researcher
magnus
soderlund
a
freemason
of
the
swedish
rite
said
that
he
believes
eating
human
flesh
derived
from
dead
bodies
might
save
the
human
race
if
only
a
world
society
were
to
awaken
the
idea
the
scientist
also
mentioned
the
possibility
of
cannibalism
during
a
tv
broadcast
on
swedish
channel
tv
meanwhile
in
the
kingdom
of
libtards
cannibalism
is
becoming
increasingly
fashionable
in
southern
california
aside
from
the
reported
fixation
of
hollywood
stars
who
engage
in
blood
rituals
and
cannibalism
the
museum
of
man
one
of
the
more
popular
museums
of
balboa
park
in
san
diego
which
is
said
to
inspire

connections
by
exploring
the
human
experience

their
sickest
exhibition
to
date
cannibals
myth
reality
in
one-of-a-kind
libtard
exhibit
you'll
discover
that
cannibals
aren't
who
you
think
they
are
and
you
might
even
want
to
join
them
if
you
were
to
listen
to
the
guides
the
museum
does
not
describe
cannibals
as
freaks
but
as
warriors
from
many
cultures
european
kings
and
queens
american
and
european
sailors
american
colonists
accident
survivors
the
sick
and
more
when

ick
factor
stifle
the
barbecue
jokes
cannibals
myth
reality
is
a
poignant
and
beautiful
experience
the
type
that
you
hope
to
get
at
a
museum
it
deftly
guides
you
from
one
emotional
place
to
another
revealing
connections
across
time
and
cultures
until
you
reach
a
point
of
deeper
understanding
through
history
art
films
interactive
displays
and
games
visitors
confront
what
seems
at
first
to
be
an
unthinkable
choice
by
the
end
you
might
realize
that
it's
far
more
nuanced
and
complicated
going
back
to
magnus
soderlund's
argument
for
human
cannibalism
that
took
center
stage
at
the
gastro
summit
during
a
panel
called
can
you
imagine
eating
human
flesh
conservative
taboos
against
cannibalism
he
said
can
change
over
time
if
people
simply
tried
eating
human
flesh
some
of
the
talking
points
at
the
seminar
have
included
whether
humans
were
too
selfish
to
live
sustainably
and
if
cannibalism
is
the
solution
to
food
sustainability
in
the
future
when
asked
during
an
interview
after
his
talk
if
he
would
try
human
flesh
soderlund
said
he
was
open
to
the
idea
cannibalism
causes
infamous
kuru
a
very
rare
disease
caused
by
an
infectious
protein
prion
found
in
contaminated
human
brain
tissue
kuru
was
first
found
among
people
from
new
guinea
who
practiced
a
form
of
cannibalism
in
which
they
ate
the
brains
of
dead
people
as
part
of
a
funeral
ritual
this
practice
stopped
in
but
cases
of
kuru
were
reported
for
many
years
afterward
because
the
disease
has
a
long
incubation
period
although
the
knee-jerk
reaction
to
eating
human
flesh
is
strong
the
actual
morality
and
ethics
behind
feelings
like
these
will
change
in
the
years
to
come
if
it
were
up
to
the
sick
propaganda
of
the
leftist
agenda
to
save
the
world
of
course
in
desperate
times
people
have
resorted
to
cannibalism
to
survive
for
instance
there
are
reports
of
cannibalism
during
the
north
korean
famine
in
the
siege
of
leningrad
in
the
early
s
and
china's
great
leap
forward
in
the
late
s
and
s
but
what
swedish
behavioral
scientist
magnus
soderlund
has
suggested
is
that
eating
people
after
they
die
could
actually
be
a
means
of
combatting
climate
change
in
the
ultimate
screwed
up
agenda
to
save
humanity
from
extinction
for
these
sickos
of
the
nwo
many
of
us
eat
our
fingernails
and
some
women
eat
their
placenta
after
giving
birth
so
why
is
it
such
a
big
deal
they
want
to
convince
us
to
become
cannibals
to
join
their
satanic
legion
