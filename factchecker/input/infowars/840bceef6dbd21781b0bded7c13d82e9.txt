evil
beyond
belief
watch
democrats
literally
worship
abortion
child
sacrifices
have
historically
taken
place
during
civilization
collapse
and
this
time
it's
no
different
the
left's
stranglehold
on
pop
culture
reveals
itself
when
late-night
comedy
show
hosts
laugh
at
abortion
concerns
and
lampoon
pro-life
americans
this
eye-opening
special
report
exposing
the
dramatic
contrast
between
the
left
and
right's
positions
on
abortion
is
a
must-see
watch
alex
jones
owen
shroyer
and
david
knight
combat
this
dark
agenda
that
has
completely
disrupted
half
of
the
population's
ability
to
debate
this
topic
intelligently
and
compassionately
