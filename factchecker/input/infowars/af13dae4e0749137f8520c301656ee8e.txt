peter
schiff
we've
accelerated
the
process
of
the
dollar's
demise
says
day
of
reckoning
coming
is
the
us
losing
its
grip
on
the
world
and
could
the
dollar
ultimately
be
dethroned
from
its
spot
as
the
world's
reserve
currency
we've
reported
extensively
on
countries
working
to
undermine
dollar
hegemony
and
reduce
the
united
states
ability
to
weaponize
the
dollar
as
a
foreign
policy
tool
along
with
the
global
gold
rush
on
the
part
of
central
banks
last
week
peter
schiff
appeared
on
rt
along
with
former
pentagon
official
michael
maloof
to
talk
about
the
world's
growing
frustration
with
america
peter
said
countries
worldwide
are
ready
to
dump
the
us
maloof
started
off
the
segment
saying
that
because
the
us
has
engaged
in
economic
warfare
with
other
countries
using
sanctions
and
tariffs
many
countries
are
looking
for
alternatives
he
said
even
strong
allies
like
countries
in
western
europe
are
starting
to
turn
more
eastward
as
a
result
peter
pointed
out
that
the
problems
for
the
us
started
long
before
donald
trump
the
real
issue
for
the
dollar
and
what's
going
to
sink
the
dollar
is
our
own
fiscal
profligacy
and
these
large
deficits
budget
deficits
and
trade
deficits
were
here
long
before
we
elected
donald
trump
of
course
trump
hasn't
done
anything
about
it
in
fact
the
deficits
are
getting
bigger
both
trade
and
budget
deficits
what
has
enabled
this
over
the
years
has
been
the
world's
willingness
to
hold
us
dollars
as
the
primary
reserve
currency
and
to
continue
to
loan
money
to
americans
and
to
the
us
government
so
we
can
continue
to
live
beyond
our
means
we
can
have
enormous
government
programs
that
we
don't
pay
for
and
we
can
consume
all
kinds
of
goods
that
we
don't
manufacture
and
we
can
live
in
an
economy
based
on
consumption
and
debt
without
having
to
save
or
produce
the
world
has
done
that
for
us
and
i
think
this
is
what's
going
to
come
to
an
end
i
think
we're
going
to
see
a
collapse
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
and
when
the
dollar
does
collapse
america's
power
is
going
to
dissipate
and
americans
are
going
to
have
to
deal
with
reality
that
we've
hollowed
out
our
infrastructure
we've
been
living
beyond
our
means
and
there's
going
to
be
a
day
of
reckoning
for
these
years
of
excesses
peter
said
the
collapse
of
the
dollar
is
inevitable
we're
not
going
to
stop
with
the
profligacy
until
it
collapses
as
long
as
the
world
is
willing
to
keep
lending
americans
money
we'll
keep
spending
it
particularly
the
government
so
the
only
thing
that
is
going
to
cause
a
change
is
a
crisis
and
it's
going
to
be
a
dollar
crisis
it's
going
to
be
a
sovereign
debt
crisis
it
should
have
already
happened
we've
been
able
to
kick
the
can
down
the
road
for
many
many
years
but
the
problem
with
all
the
can-kicking
is
the
underlying
problems
have
gotten
so
much
worse
so
now
it's
a
much
bigger
problem
that
we're
going
to
have
to
deal
with
maloof
said
the
iran
sanctions
have
backfired
and
pushed
iran
into
a
closer
relationship
with
china
peter
noted
that
iran
just
entered
into
a
deal
with
china
under
which
the
chinese
will
help
develop
iranian
infrastructure
in
exchange
for
oil
the
sanctions
that
we
have
been
imposing
around
the
world
this
is
simply
giving
the
world
yet
another
reason
to
look
for
an
alternative
to
the
us
dollar
which
they
should
have
been
looking
for
a
long
time
ago
but
now
by
flexing
muscle
we
really
shouldn't
be
flexing
we're
in
effect
biting
the
hands
that
have
been
feeding
us
and
now
they're
questioning
whether
or
not
they
should
continue
to
do
that
and
so
we've
accelerated
the
process
of
the
dollar's
demise
by
antagonizing
so
many
of
the
nations
around
the
world
that
we
really
need
to
continue
to
hold
the
dollar
peter
said
despite
what
trump
says
the
us
does
not
have
china
over
a
barrel
in
the
trade
war
we
have
far
more
to
lose
the
chinese
simply
lose
a
customer
that
doesn't
pay
that
they
have
to
vendor
finance
but
we
lose
a
banker
we
lose
a
supplier
the
chinese
have
been
propping
up
the
us
economy
we
have
been
screwing
up
the
chinese
economy
because
in
order
to
maintain
this
relationship
they
have
pursued
reckless
monetary
policy
they
have
inflated
bubbles
they
have
done
things
in
order
to
artificially
prop
up
the
dollar
so
they
can
continue
to
sell
products
to
people
who
really
can't
afford
to
buy
them
rt
played
a
clip
of
trump
downplaying
the
amount
of
us
debt
the
chinese
hold
over
trillion
in
us
treasurys
peter
called
the
president
delusional
saying
that
trillion
is
just
treasury
bonds
the
chinese
also
hold
a
lot
of
dollar-denominated
debt
in
addition
to
the
treasury
debt
on
the
margin
that
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
if
we
lose
chinese
lending
if
the
chinese
want
to
unload
their
dollar-denominated
debt
president
trump
seems
to
think
there's
an
ample
supply
of
lenders
that
really
want
that
debt
i
don't
believe
that
they
exist
i
don't
know
that
there's
that
many
foolish
people
out
there
in
the
world
that
want
to
lend
so
much
money
to
the
us
at
such
a
low
rate
of
interest
peter
said
the
rising
price
of
gold
reveals
an
unpleasant
the
truth
people
are
losing
confidence
in
the
dollar
you
can't
see
it
in
the
foreign
exchange
markets
the
dollar
hasn't
really
started
to
fall
against
other
fiat
currencies
but
that's
because
all
fiat
currencies
are
falling
against
the
dollar
against
gold
but
the
strength
of
gold
is
showing
an
underlying
weakness
in
the
dollar
that
the
forex
markets
aren't
showing
yet
but
they
will
peter
closed
out
the
segment
saying
the
us
stock
market
has
much
more
to
worry
about
than
the
trade
war
there
are
other
problems
that
are
much
more
important
that
are
being
ignored
this
is
a
big
fat
ugly
bubble
donald
trump
was
right
as
a
candidate
and
the
air
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
bubble
regardless
of
what
happens
with
the
trade
war
as
the
rt
anchor
put
it
so
we're
not
surprised
gold
is
doing
so
well
mike
adams
exposes
the
agenda
of
the
private
fed
as
a
war
against
the
prosperity
of
americans
that
simply
want
to
make
america
great
