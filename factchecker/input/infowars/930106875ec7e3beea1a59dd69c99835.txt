german
scientists
conclude
term
race
is
racist
no
biological
basis
for
classification
of
humanity
into
races
they
claim
following
the
th
anniversary
of
the
death
of
the
german
darwin
researchers
have
distanced
themselves
from
the
classification
of
humans
into
races
scientific
decency
should
preclude
using
the
term
race
they
say
scientists
at
the
university
of
jena
in
eastern
germany
have
called
for
the
term
race
to
no
longer
be
used
saying
there
is
no
biological
basis
for
the
classification
of
humanity
into
races
the
primarily
biological
justification
for
defining
groups
of
humans
as
races
for
example
based
on
the
color
of
their
skin
or
eyes
or
the
shape
of
their
skulls
has
led
to
the
persecution
enslavement
and
slaughter
of
millions
of
people
the
scientists
wrote
in
the
jena
declaration
however
there
is
no
biological
basis
for
races
and
there
has
never
been
one
the
concept
of
race
is
the
result
of
racism
not
its
prerequisite
they
continued
trump's
lack
of
new
border
wall
highlights
the
need
for
security
in
light
of
focused
efforts
to
collapse
borders
around
the
globe
the
hierarchical
categorization
of
groups
of
people
based
on
their
biological
traits
for
example
eye
color
skin
color
or
skull
shape
infers
evolutionary
relationships
between
species
which
scientists
in
jena
now
call
a
form
of
racism
the
jena
declaration
composed
by
martin
s.
fischer
uwe
hossfeld
and
johannes
krause
of
the
friedrich
schiller
university
jena
and
stefan
richter
from
the
university
of
rostock
was
presented
at
the
th
annual
meeting
of
the
german
zoological
society
in
jena
at
an
event
titled
jena
haeckel
and
the
question
of
human
races
or
how
racism
creates
races
this
year
marked
th
anniversary
of
the
death
of
ernst
haeckel
who
was
seen
by
many
as
germany's
answer
to
darwin
he
was
a
well-known
german
zoologist
and
evolutionary
biologist
who
some
say
contributed
to
nazi
biology
through
haeckel's
allegedly
scientific
classification
of
human
races
into
a
family
tree
he
made
a
fateful
contribution
to
a
form
of
racism
that
was
seemingly
based
on
science
the
scientists
wrote
scientific
research
on
genetic
variations
of
human
beings
shows
that
instead
of
definable
boundaries
genetic
gradients
run
between
human
groups
say
the
scientists
to
be
explicit
not
only
is
there
no
single
gene
that
underpins
racial
differences
but
there
is
not
even
a
single
base
pair
this
research
carries
added
weight
in
germany
where
during
the
nazi
era
eugenics
a
set
of
beliefs
and
practices
aimed
at
ostensibly
improving
the
genetic
quality
of
a
human
population
and
racial
hygiene
were
used
extensively
in
order
to
further
the
national
socialist
ideological
tenet
of
maintaining
a
pure
master
race
that
was
biologically
superior
to
other
races
the
president
of
jena
university
walter
rosenthal
admits
that
while
simply
removing
the
word
race
from
shared
vocabulary
will
not
prevent
racism
as
academics
we
can
help
to
ensure
that
racism
is
no
longer
able
to
invoke
us
as
a
justification
in
the
jena
declaration
the
group
of
scientists
drew
a
link
between
current
forms
of
racism
and
seemingly
scientific
disciplines
like
racial
hygiene
or
eugenics
designating
the
africans
as
a
supposed
threat
to
europe
and
attributing
certain
biological
characteristics
are
also
in
the
direct
tradition
of
the
worst
racism
of
our
past
so
let
us
ensure
that
people
are
never
again
discriminated
against
on
specious
biological
grounds

the

crisis
in
europe
and
beyond
