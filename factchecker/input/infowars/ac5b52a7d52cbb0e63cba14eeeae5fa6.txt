the
trump
administration
is
considering
launching
a
social
credit
score-style
system
in
coordination
with
big
tech
that
would
use
spy
data
collected
from
amazon
google
and
apple
devices
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
can
own
a
gun
the
proposal
is
part
of
an
initiative
to
create
a
health
advanced
research
projects
agency
harpa
which
would
be
located
inside
the
health
and
human
services
department
reports
the
daily
caller
the
new
agency
would
have
a
separate
budget
and
the
president
would
be
responsible
for
appointing
its
director
harpa
would
employ
breakthrough
technologies
with
high
specificity
and
sensitivity
for
early
diagnosis
of
neuropsychiatric
violence

of

orwell
in
other
words
data
collected
from
devices
that
spy
on
private
conversations
and
closely
monitor
user
behavior
would
be
used
to
strip
americans
of
their
fundamental
rights
though
the
proposal
is
starting
as
a
voluntary
data
collection
scheme
allegedly
aimed
at
finding
warning
signs
of
mental
illness
we
all

according
to
the
washington
post
trump
has
reacted
very
positively

the
idea

the
full
scope
of
the
program
is
chilling
and
would
provide
big
tech
with
an
easy
excuse
to
formally
impose
the
total
neuro-surveillance
of
citizens
via
their
smart
phone
and
home
assistant
devices
something
that
has
already
been
occurring
surreptitiously
for
years
one
wonders
if
trump
has
any
idea
of
the
slippery
slope
this
would
entail
or
whether
he
was
sold
on
the
idea
because
ivanka
cried
the
proposal
bears
some
similarities
to
communist
china's
social
credit
score
system
where
citizens
behavior
is
tightly
surveilled
and
then
met
with
rewards
or
punishments
as
we
reported
last
month
the
chinese
government
bragged
about
preventing
million
discredited
entities
from
purchasing
plane
tickets
and
people
from
buying
high
speed
train
tickets
in
the
