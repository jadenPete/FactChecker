liberals
gladly
sign
petition
to
protect
eagle
eggs
but
not
human
babies
unborn
eagles
those
still
in
their
eggs
deserve
the
government's
full
protection
but
human
babies
still
in
their
mother's
womb
do
not
unborn
eagles
those
still
in
their
eggs
deserve
the
government's
full
protection
but
human
babies
still
in
their
mother's
womb
do
not
that
was
the
consensus
of
several
california
liberals
recently
approached
by
prageru's
will
witt
who
asked
folks
to
sign
petitions
to
protect
both
species
bald
eagle
eggs
are
protected
under
federal
law
but
there
is
no
federal
law
protecting
children
from
abortion
will
witt
takes
to
the
streets
to
find
out
if
people
in
los
angeles
would
sign
a
petition
to
protect
eagle
eggs
along
with
a
petition
to
protect
babies
in
the
womb
prageru
posted
in
the
video's
description
the
footage
made
it
clear
there's
a
double
standard
on
what
lives
are
worth
protecting
with
all
those
questioned
in
echo
park
freely
signing
on
to
help
their
feathered
friends
and
none
willing
to
do
the
same
for
unborn
babies
ya
of
course
a
red-headed
woman
exclaimed
when
presented
with
the
eagle
petition
eagles
are
people
too
oh
my
god
how
fun
a
bikinied
blonde
pounding
white
claws
in
the
park
told
witt
ya
definitely
two
men
agreed
as
they
signed
best
of
luck
i
hope
you
save
the
eagles
another
young
woman
said
adding
her
john
hancock
the
cooperative
tone
quickly
shifted
when
witt
presented
the
second
petition
though
several
seemed
to
understand
the
irony
oh
wait
i
don't
agree
with
that
the
red-head
said
no
i'm
pro-abortion
sorry
this
is
awkward
now
she
said
the
red-head
argued
that
killing
children
while
protecting
eagle
eggs
makes
sense
because
like
eagles
aren't
raped
oh
no
i
don't
agree
i
fully
support
abortion
the
other
young
woman
said
why
do
you
support
not
the
killing
unborn
eagles
but
the
killing
of
unborn
children
witt
pressed
um
i
think
it's
the
mother's
decision
she
said
a
human
woman
should
have
more
rights
probably
than
a
bald
eagle
she
added
with
a
resist
fist
abortion
i
feel
like
anyone
can
make
their
own
decision
about
their
body
said
the
boozy
blonde
babies
are
gross
the
educational
exercise
was
enlightening
witt
said
we
found
that
a
lot
of
the
people
who
we
talked
to
at
the
beginning
of
our
interview
with
them
didn't
really
like
us
at
the
end
of
our
interview
with
them
which
is
ok
cause
we
got
some
good
educational
stuff
