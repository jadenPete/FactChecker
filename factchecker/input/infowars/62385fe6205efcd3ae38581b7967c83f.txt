cnn
is
promoting
the
idea
of
young
people
living
in
pods
in
the
center
of
huge
cities
where
they
have
no
privacy
elvina
black
the
ceo
of
podshare
says
she
was
born
in
the
soviet
union
and
liked
the
idea
of
the
government
giving
you
everything
in
a
communist
state
what
if
you
subscribed
to
a
housing
membership
and
could
have
all
your
needs
met
these
basic
things
that
you
just
need
to
live
they
should
be
handled
for
you
she
added
the
accommodation
is
described
as
affordable
shared
housing
despite
the
fact
that
each
tenant
pays
dollars
a
month
for
their
micro-pod
black
likes
the
idea
because
it
suits
her
desire
to
live
solo
single
no
children
no
pets
one
of
the
tenants
said
he
earns
dollars
a
month
but
struggled
to
live
on
that
budget
in
san
francisco
he
also
said
that
the
accommodation
afforded
no
privacy
this
is
the
future
urban
millennials
have
to
look
forward
to
living
in
atomized
dystopian
mega
cities
in
pods
because
everything
else
is
totally
unaffordable
no
pets
no
family
no
ownership
live
in
a
pod
work
in
a
pod
