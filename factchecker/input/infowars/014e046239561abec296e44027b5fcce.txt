the
victim's
mother
told
local
media
the
attack
occurred
after
damante
allegedly
bumped
into
someone
he
didn't
know
that
night
but
still
doesn't
know
what
could
have
motivated
her
son's
attacker
to
my
understanding
he
didn't
even
know
these
people
so
why
would
you
hit
somebody
with
a
bowling
ball
in
the
head

said

came
up
from

him
when
the
security
guard
was
holding
him
and
threw
a
bowling
ball
and
hit
his

bring
this
person
to
