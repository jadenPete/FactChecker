looks
very
odd
that

doesn't

to
end
the

that
president
obama
began
in
his
discretion
that

was

think
it's
very

that
the

is
going
to
issue
an

reinstating

continued
the
tweets
pertained
to
the
deferred
action
on
childhood
arrivals
then-president
barack
obama
signed
daca
in
allowing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
young
undocumented
aliens
who
entered
the
u.s.
illegally
as
children
to
be
safe
from
deportation
while
it
does
not
give
recipients
any
permanent
legal
status
the
executive
order
has
allowed
young
illegal
immigrants
to
legally
work
in
the
country
and
obtain
driver's
licenses
previously
obama
had
suggested
he
did
not
have
the
authority
to
implement
a
policy
such
as
daca
without
input
from
congress
since
he
signed
the
order
republicans
have
vehemently
quested
the
legality
of
the
move
the
trump
administration
has
since
struggled
in
its
attempt
to
strike
down
daca
then-attorney
general
jeff
sessions
announced
in
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
the
measure
would
be
rescinded
however
a
federal
appeals
court
upheld
a
nationwide
injunction
against
the
move
in
november
and
now
the
fight
heads
to
the
supreme
court
the
nation's
highest
court
has
scheduled
oral
arguments
for
november
with
a
decision
to
follow
sometime
in
