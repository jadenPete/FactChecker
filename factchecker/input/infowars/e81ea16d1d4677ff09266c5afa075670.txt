makes
landfall
in
carolinas
as
pillaging
looting
begins
in
the
bahamas
the
warzone
left
behind
in
the
bahamas
is
getting
worse
by
the
day
despite
being
downgraded
to
category
winds
still
reached
up
to
mph
as
hurricane
dorian
blew
ashore
at
cape
hatteras
making
its
first
landfall
on
the
u.s.
mainland
flooding
homes
in
the
low-lying
ribbon
of
islands
and
throwing
a
scare
into
year-round
residents
who
tried
to
tough
it
out
as
of
this
morning
dorian
was
moving
northeast
at
mph
kph
it
is
expected
to
remain
a
hurricane
as
it
sweeps
up
the
eastern
seaboard
on
friday
and
saturday
far
enough
offshore
that
its
hurricane-force
winds
are
unlikely
to
reach
land
while
the
damage
was
far
less
than
feared
in
many
parts
of
the
carolinas
the
warzone
left
behind
in
the
bahamas
is
getting
worse
by
the
day
as
yahoo
reports
much
of
great
abaco
island
remains
inundated
making
emergency
access
difficult
hundreds
of
boats
smaller
dinghies
and
large
trawlers
lie
on
their
sides
or
flipped
like
pancakes
onto
their
decks
supine
and
abandoned
to
their
fate
by
the
receding
ocean
the
death
toll
has
risen
to
as
ap
reports
the
united
nations
announced
the
purchase
of
eight
tons
of
ready-to-eat
meals
and
said
it
will
provide
satellite
communications
equipment
and
airlift
storage
units
generators
and
prefab
offices
to
set
up
logistics
hubs

in
immediate
need
of
life-saving

a

dropped
off
meals
bottles
of
water
and
more
than

as
well
as

remains
very
far
from
hopeful
for
