the
austin
texas
city
council
this
week
passed
a
measure
giving
of
taxpayer
money
to
fund
abortions
on
tuesday
the
council
announced
a
budget
package
allocating
the
cash
to
the
city's
public
health
department
which
in
turn
will
distribute
the
money
to
groups
helping
poor
women
secure
abortions

austin
city
councilman
greg
casar
praised
the
bill
for
increasing
access
to
abortion
a
move
that
will
invariably
lead
to
the
death
of
unborn
babies
every
day
the
anti-abortion
elements
in
texas
in
washington
d.c.
and
elsewhere
wake
up
and
think
how
can
we
restrict
access
to
abortion
today
casar
told
nbc
that
makes
it
our
job
every
day
to
work
to
expand
access
to
abortion
and
health
care
and
other
basic
services
related
to
abortion
texas
pro-life
groups
however
lamented
the
fact
the
city
passes
resolutions
to
protect
the
environment
and
not
the
unborn
it
is
appalling
the
city
of
austin
doubled-down
on
its
policies
to
save
the
trees
kill
the
children
said
nicole
hudgins
with
the
pro-life
group
texas
values
this
budget
amendment
is
a
political
stunt
attempting
to
circumvent
the
law
if
the
city
really
wants
to
help
women
they
should
lower
their
taxes
and
stop
killing
innocent
children

greg
abbott
passed
a
resolution
this
year
preventing
local
governments
from
funding
organizations
which
perform
abortions
however
the
city's
new
measure
appears
to
be
an
attempt
to
skirt
that
law
by
instead
giving
the
money
to
groups
that
assist
women
in
obtaining
abortions
bilger
writes
the
money
could
in
effect
fund
late-term
abortions
by
paying
for
women
to
travel
to
states
where
the
practice
is

labeled
the

measure
grotesque
news
this
grotesque
news
is
another
example
of
the
abortion
industry
exploiting
taxpayers
to
profit
off
vulnerable
women
and
kill
preborn
children
