canceled

for

attacks
the
taliban
has
taken
over
another
district
in
afghanistan
the
second
in
two
weeks
saying
that
the
us
will
regret
abandoning
key
peace
talks
that
stalled
after
donald
trump
called
off
a
much-awaited
meeting
with
the
group
yangi
qala
a
district
in
afghanistan's
northern
province
of
takhar
fell
into
the
hands
of
taliban
fighters
on
tuesday
after
government
troops
retreated
over
fear
of
greater
casualties
local
authorities
told
the
media
they
sent
reinforcements
in
order
to
drive
the
taliban
out
of
the
area
claiming
that
dozens
of
militants
were
killed
but
the
seizure
of
the
district
which
lies
close
to
the
border
of
russia's
military
ally
tajikistan
comes
days
after
the
taliban
made
another
advance
by
capturing
the
anar
darah
neighborhood
in
western
afghanistan
the
news
follows
a
recent
decision
by
trump
to
cancel
a
meeting
with
taliban
representatives
at
camp
david
asking
the
group
if
they
are
ready
for
the
next
few
decades
of
war
the
us
president
said
he
canceled
the
meeting
after
the
taliban
claimed
responsibility
for
attacks
in
kabul
which
killed
people
including
one
us
soldier
earlier
in
the
week
president
trump
has
delivered
his
assessment
of
the
military
strategy
being
enacted
by
america
in
afghanistan
on
its
part
the
taliban
warned
that
the
us
will
suffer
heavy
losses
for
ditching
the
key
talks
yet
the
takeovers
seem
to
be
a
continuation
of
their
stick-and-carrot
tactics
later
on
tuesday
taliban
spokesman
zabihullah
mujahid
reiterated
the
threat
saying
that
washington
will
regret
not
getting
back
to
the
table
the
islamist
group
he
said
will
resume
jihad
and
fighting
to
end
the
foreign
occupation
of
afghanistan
in
recent
years
us
negotiators
held
several
rounds
of
low-key
talks
with
the
militants
in
their
political
office
in
doha
qatar
providing
some
opening
for
a
possible
truce
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
it
could
be
reached
at
all
given
that
the
taliban
frequently
target
local
and
foreign
forces
sometimes
taking
control
of
important
cities
and
locations
initially
decimated
in
the
post-
us
airstrikes
and
the
subsequent

intervention
the
taliban
made
a
resurgence
and
hit
back
gradually
expanding
influence
in
the
east
west
and
south
of
the
country
now
they
control
more
swathes
of
land
in
afghanistan
than
at
any
point
since
