longtime
zimbabwean
strongman
robert
mugabe
dies
at
mugabe's
overthrow
was
seen
as
long
overdue
by
many
foreign
analysts
visiting
dignitaries
were
given
gifts
of
his
portrait
and
rightfully
so
to
many
zimbabweans
robert
mugabe
the
strongman
who
ruled
the
east
african
nation
for
years
until
he
was
ousted
in
a
bloodless
coup
two
years
ago
was
a
complex
figure
he
was
a
symbol
of
liberation
and
hope
a
leader
of
the
quasi-communist
zanu-pf
who
helped
free
his
country
from
oppressive
british
rule
according
to
the
nyt
mugabe
was
at
the
time
of
his
death
later
when
food
stocks
started
to
run
low
mugabe's
true
nature
became
apparent
he
authorized
oppressive
crackdowns
and
indefinite
detentions
of
suspected
political
opponents
some
suspected
him
of
torture
and
unspeakable
treatment
of
suspected
political
opponents
but
mugabe
wasn't
alone
in
this
many
in
his
generation
of
african
revolutionary
political
leaders
believed
that
since
they
had
freed
the
country
from
colonial
rule
it
was
theirs
to
govern
as
mugabe
put
it
until
god
says
come
and
he
almost
made
it
in
november
army
officers
fearing
that
mugabe
would
anoint
his
second
wife
grace
mugabe
some
years
his
junior
as
his
political
heir
moved
against
him
within
a
dramatic
few
days
he
was
placed
under
house
arrest
and
forced
by
his
political
party
zanu-pf
to
step
down
yet
remarkably
for
a
continent
where
strongmen
leaders
are
typically
shown
little
if
any
mercy
mugabe
and
his
wife
were
treated
well
by
his
successor
and
the
party
he
had
formerly
led
the
military
insisted
that
mugabe's
ouster
wasn't
tantamount
to
a
coup
mugabe's
overthrow
was
seen
as
long
overdue
by
many
foreign
analysts
during
the
latter
years
of
his
tenure
in
office
mugabe's
policies
led
to
an
all-out
collapse
of
zimbabwe's
currency
erasing
the
savings
of
most
ordinary
zimbabweans

mugabe's
death
was
announced
by
his
successor
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
who
issued
the
following
statement
on
twitter
praising
mugabe
as
a
competent
compassionate
leader
who
was
one
of
the
country's
founding
fathers
last
month
zimbabwe's
government
had
disclosed
that
mugabe
had
spent
several
months
in
singapore
undergoing
treatment
for
an
undisclosed
illness
mnangagwa
was
a
longtime
aide
to
mugabe
and
even
after
the
coup
only
spoke
kindly
of
mugabe
at
least
when
he
was
in
public
at
his
presidential
inauguration
in
november
mnangagwa
described
his
erstwhile
mentor
as
one
of
the
founding
fathers
and
leaders
of
our
nation
to
me
personally
he
remains
a
father
