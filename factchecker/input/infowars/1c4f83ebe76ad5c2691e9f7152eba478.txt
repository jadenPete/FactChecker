hurricane
dorian
has
regained
strength
and
is
reportedly
on
a
collision
course
with
the
carolinas
global
weather
patterns
have
definitely
been
behaving
very
strangely
all
year
long
and
we
could
most
certainly
see
even
more
surprises
in
the
weeks
ahead
are
the
carolinas
about
to
take
a
direct
hit
from
hurricane
dorian
as
you
will
see
below
that
is
what
some
mainstream
media
reports
appear
to
indicate
but
the
truth
is
much
more
nuanced
than
that
yes
dorian
is
definitely
heading
toward
the
carolinas
and
without
a
doubt
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
could
make
landfall
along
the
coast
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
this
will
happen
meteorologists
are
telling
us
that
dorian
will
eventually
be
pushed
out
of
danger
to
the
north
and
east
but
that
may
not
happen
in
time
to
spare
many
coastal
communities
in
both
north
and
south
carolina
and
let
there
be
no
mistake
this
remains
an
exceedingly
dangerous
storm
in
fact
in
recent
hours
the
storm
has
regained
strength
and
has
become
even
larger
stronger
and
a
little
larger
hurricane
dorian
is
gradually
leaving
florida
behind
setting
its
sights
on
the
coasts
of
georgia
and
the
carolinas
these
areas
face
a
triple
threat
of
destructive
winds
flooding
rains
and
life-threatening
storm
surges
according
to
the
national
hurricane
center
we
actually
do
not
know
if
dorian
will
make
landfall
in
the
carolinas
at
this
point
but
after
reading
some
mainstream
articles
you
would
be
tempted
to
think
that
is
precisely
what
is
going
to
happen
for
example
the
following
comes
from
usa
today
hurricane
dorian
swept
past
florida
on
wednesday
on
a
collision
course
with
the
carolinas
claiming
its
first
life
in
the
u.s.
and
promising
heavy
rains
powerful
winds
and
damaging
surge
that
certainly
makes
it
sound
like
the
carolinas
are
definitely
going
to
take
a
direct
hit
from
this
storm
right
but
the
latest
official
forecast
makes
it
very
clear
that
things
could
go
either
way
the
following
comes
to
us
from
the
noaa
at
pm
edt
utc
the
large
eye
of
hurricane
dorian
was
located
near
latitude
north
longitude
west
dorian
is
moving
northward
near
mph
km
h
a
turn
to
the
north-northeast
is
anticipated
on
thursday
with
a
turn
toward
the
northeast
on
thursday
night
a
northeastward
motion
at
a
faster
forward
speed
is
forecast
on
friday
on
the
forecast
track
the
center
of
dorian
will
continue
to
approach
the
coast
of
south
carolina
tonight
move
near
or
over
the
coast
of
south
carolina
on
thursday
and
then
move
near
or
over
the
coast
of
north
carolina
thursday
night
and
friday
but
whether
this
storm
officially
makes
landfall
or
not
the
storm
surge
that
will
be
created
will
certainly
be
immense
a
caller
to
the
alex
jones
show
questions
the
possibility
of
hurricane
dorian
being
manipulated
by
modern
weather
weapons
and
even
though
it
is
no
longer
a
category
storm
dorian
is
still
capable
of
pushing
vast
amounts
of
water
because
of
how
absolutely
enormous
it
is
now
that
dorian
is
starting
to
accelerate
northward
the
storm
surge
threat
to
the
vulnerable
southeast
u.s.
coast
will
increase
dorian's
enlarged
circulation
is
pushing
vast
amounts
of
water
so
the
surge
will
be
larger
than
one
might
assume
from
dorian's
decrease
from
category
to
category
strength
hurricanes
such
as
ike
and
sandy
produced
massively
destructive
surge
long
after
their
peak
winds
decreased
and
their
circulations
expanded
so
those
along
the
carolina
coastline
that
are
not
taking
this
storm
seriously
are
in
desperate
need
of
a
reality
check
according
to
fox
news
some
of
the
waves
could
be
up
to
feet
high
more
than
a
million
people
along
the
east
coast
have
been
ordered
to
evacuate
and
north
carolina
governor
roy
cooper
is
strongly
urging
those
in
the
danger
zone
to
obey
those
orders
leave
now
if
you
are
in
an
area
where
an
evacuation
has
been
ordered
north
carolina
gov
roy
cooper
urged
it
is
not
worth
putting
your
life
or
the
life
of
first
responders
at
risk
cooper
said
an
year-old
man
fell
to
his
death
from
a
ladder
while
preparing
his
columbus
county
home
for
the
storm
at
least
deaths
in
the
bahamas
have
been
linked
to
dorian
in
life
timing
can
be
everything
and
if
you
are
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
it
can
literally
cost
you
your
life
by
the
beginning
of
next
week
communities
along
the
carolina
coastline
will
be
completely
out
of
danger
but
over
the
next
couple
of
days
we
could
potentially
see
some
needless
deaths
because
certain
people
stubbornly
refused
to
evacuate
if
you
don't
believe
that
the
danger
is
real
perhaps
you
need
to
read
more
about
what
this
storm
just
did
to
the
bahamas
the
extent
of
dorian's
destruction
across
the
northern
bahamas
is
immense
as
seen
from
the
air
over
abaco
island
the
damage
stretches
for
miles
entire
neighborhoods
are
flattened
homes
shredded
shipping
containers
and
boats
hurled
inland
some
airports
now
look
more
like
lakes
the
terminal
of
one
airport
is
now
shrouded
in
debris
yes
dorian
is
no
longer
a
category
storm
but
neither
was
hurricane
katrina
when
it
hit
new
orleans
in
fact
hurricane
katrina
was
only
a
category
storm
when
it
finally
made
landfall
we
should
be
thankful
that
a
worst
case
scenario
for
this
storm
never
materialized
because
what
happened
to
the
bahamas
could
have
very
easily
happened
to
us
it
was
the
worst
natural
disaster
that
those
islands
have
ever
seen
and
the
recovery
process
is
going
to
be
measured
in
years
by
saturday
the
danger
should
be
gone
but
authorities
are
watching
several
more
potentially
dangerous
storms
right
now
hurricane
season
does
not
end
until
november
th
and
so
we
are
definitely
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
global
weather
patterns
have
definitely
been
behaving
very
strangely
all
year
long
and
we
could
most
certainly
see
even
more
surprises
in
the
weeks
ahead
