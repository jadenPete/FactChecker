government
won't
save
us
from
woke
corporations
the
last
thing
we
need
is
a
government
solution
to
corporate
efforts
to
crush
speech
and
dissenting
opinions
answers
lie
in
the
marketplace
from
the
shoes
you
wear
to
the
ice
cream
you
eat
politics
has
found
a
way
to
sneak
into
some
of
the
most
mundane
aspects
of
our
lives
the
new
trend
of
woke
capital
where
firms
are
actively
promoting
social
justice
causes
has
had
many
free-marketers
scratching
their
heads
at
how
corporate
america
has
hopped
on
board
this
wave
of
progressivism
take
for
example
the
ice
cream
company
ben
jerry's
ben
jerry's
has
made
it
a
point
to
virtue
signal
about
the
latest
leftist
hobby
horses
it
made
sure
to
showcase
its
progressive
credentials
through
its
launch
of
a
resistance-themed
ice
cream
flavor
and
even
went
as
far
as
to
endorse
the
green
new
deal
woke
capital
was
also
on
full
display
when
nike
decided
to
pull
its
betsy
ross
flag
line
of
shoes
thanks
to
pressure
from
former
nfl
player
colin
kaepernick
now
an
activist
kaepernick
viewed
the
betsy
ross
flag
as
an
image
of
racism
due
to
its
creation
during
the
american
revolution
when
slavery
was
still
present
a
similar
trend
of
political
activism
gone
corporate
has
popped
up
when
dealing
with
wedge
issues
such
as
gun
rights
companies
such
as
salesforce
recently
stopped
doing
business
with
organizations
that
sell
semi-automatic
rifles
and
firearms
accessories
this
decision
is
part
of
a
larger
wave
off
corporate
gun
control
taking
place
since
the
parkland
shooting
corporations
are
following
in
the
state's
footsteps
the
threat
of
state
action
has
hamstrung
many
forms
of
private
associations
and
has
seeped
into
the
culture
as
well
the
therapeutic
managerial
state
we
see
today
functions
as
a
public-private
partnership
where
political
correctness
culture
is
pushed
as
a
means
of
re-socializing
the
public
corporate
actors
are
now
well
aware
of
this
and
work
to
one-up
their
pc
overlords
in
the
entrenched
dc
bureaucracy
by
trying
to
be
woke
in
the
boardroom
big
tech
is
a
great
example
last
year's
social
media
purges
of
political
personalities
such
as
alex
jones
demonstrated
this
new
form
of
corporate
policing
however
the
blunt
force
of
the
state
still
lurked
in
the
background
as
the
late
justin
raimondo
previously
noted
during
the
jones
deplatforming
saga
all
this
wasn't
good
enough
for
sen
chris
murphy
d-connecticut
who
demanded
to
know
if
the
plan
was
to
only
take
down
one
web
site
no
doubt
he
has
a
whole
list
of
sites
he'd
like
to
take
down
even
more
ominously
it
was
revealed
that
a
direct
threat
had
been
made
to
these
companies
by
sen
mark
warner
d-virginia
who
sent
out
a
memo
listing
all
the
ways
the
government
could
crack
down
on
big
data
if
they
refuse
to
go
along
with
cleansing
the
internet
of
divisive
material
even
though
no
direct
legislative
action
came
out
of
senator
murphy's
threats
many
companies
are
well
aware
of
the
state's
power
to
modify
private
behavior
the
administrative
state's
willingness
to
put
the
clamps
on
allegedly
discriminatory
activities
is
well-documented
so
these
companies
have
every
incentive
to
be
on
their
best
behavior
and
in
some
cases
go
the
extra
mile
by
being
woke
to
avoid
bureaucratic
persecution
changing
corporate
culture
it
is
intriguing
that
there
hasn't
been
much
pushback
against
corporate
virtue
signaling
from
consumers
this
indicates
some
degree
of
cultural
tolerance
from
a
large
portion
of
the
population
just
think
about
it
when's
the
last
time
a
mass
conservative
boycott
of
a
company
enacting
woke
policies
led
to
its
bankruptcy
bill
anderson's
point
about
how
the
fundamentals
of
private
property
prices
and
profits
and
losses
cannot
be
ignored
in
any
business
operation
is
valid
but
it
overlooks
one
trend
that
has
taken
place
during
the
last
few
decades
how
much
the
american
consumer
base
has
been
re-socialized
by
the
managerial
state
and
its
many
indoctrination
mechanisms
paul
gottfried
makes
an
interesting
observation
about
both
corporate
titans
and
consumers
in
the
twenty-first
century
when
it
relates
to
deplatforming
many
of
those
who
avail
themselves
of
zuckerberg's
invention
hold
the
same
political
and
cultural
beliefs
i'm
not
even
sure
that
the
decisions
made
by
facebook
and
google
here
and
in
western
europe
to
kick
political
conservatives
off
their
sites
is
a
bad
business
practice
perhaps
most
users
of
these
internet
conveniences
welcome
p.c.
intolerance
gottfried
also
explains
how
entrepreneurs
during
the
gilded
age
like
cornelius
vanderbilt
john
d.
rockefeller
and
andrew
carnegie
generally
held
more
traditional
views
and
were
devout
protestants
and
they
lived
in
societies
in
which
both
rich
and
poor
were
expected
to
conform
to
certain
bourgeois
proprieties
that
hardly
exist
anymore
in
sum
there
is
not
enough
collective
opposition
to
match
the
woke
corporate
america
of
the
twenty-first
century
nor
the
activist
groups
constantly
pressing
for
more
diversity
and
inclusiveness
in
the
workplace
what
we
see
now
is
both
corporate
leadership
that
is
either
culturally
receptive
to
social
justice
culture
and
a
more
apathetic
consumer
base
that
does
not
care
about
the
politics
of
these
companies
enough
to
actually
revolt
against
them
via
the
pocketbook
some
rightwing
politicians
have
suggested
additional
government
regulation
in
retaliation
against
these
firms
but
for
those
more
inclined
toward
laissez-faire
consumer
action
and
robust
civil
society
are
more
important
than
ever
instead
of
exclusively
focusing
on
elections
free-marketers
should
shift
their
energy
toward
business
and
cultural
endeavors
in
these
areas
there
are
more
level
playing
fields
the
silver
lining
of
this
new
woke
capital
trend
is
that
these
kinds
of
battles
will
incentivize
free-market
advocates
to
put
more
skin
in
the
game
and
actually
build
viable
alternatives
to
current
corporate
structures
for
example
amazon
shareholders
nixed
several
employee-led
proposals
which
included
a
plan
to
tackle
climate
change
similarly
google
shareholders
rejected
a
plan
to
link
executive
compensation
to
diversity
goals
through
shareholder
pressure
those
of
free-market
inclinations
can
make
their
voices
heard
more
boardroom
less
ballot
box
the
last
thing
we
should
do
in
these
situations
is
to
bring
the
government
in
to
normalize
business
conduct
if
anything
the
last
century
has
demonstrated
that
government
stepping
into
private
affairs
has
thrown
everything
out
of
whack
as
american
society
becomes
more
polarized
and
the
government
maintains
its
automated
growth
alternative
strategies
that
promote
political
decentralization
are
crucial
