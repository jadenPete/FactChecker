researchers
blame
marriage
rate
decline
on
a
lack
of
economically-attractive
men
could
it
be
possible
that
all
of
the
romantic
ideals
that
we
fill
our
heads
with
as
young
people
are
not
actually
based
in
reality
you
can't
make
this
stuff
up
the
marriage
rate
in
the
united
states
began
steadily
falling
in
the
s
and
has
been
hovering
near
record
lows
in
recent
years
and
much
has
been
written
about
why
this
is
happening
but
now
researchers
from
cornell
university
are
promoting
a
shocking
new
theory
that
could
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
the
entire
debate
according
to
their
new
study
which
was
just
published
in
the
journal
of
marriage
and
family
the
primary
reason
why
the
u.s.
marriage
rate
has
been
declining
is
because
there
is
a
lack
of
economically-attractive
men
in
other
words
these
researchers
are
saying
that
a
large
number
of
single
men
out
there
are
simply
not
marriage
material
because
they
are
not
making
enough
money
it
seems
very
strange
that
researchers
at
an
ivy
league
university
would
make
such
a
claim
in
this
day
and
age
but
apparently
they
are
quite
serious
according
to
the
lead
author
of
the
study
marriage
is
fundamentally
an
economic
transaction
most
american
women
hope
to
marry
but
current
shortages
of
marriageable
men
men
with
a
stable
job
and
a
good
income
make
this
increasingly
difficult
especially
in
the
current
gig
economy
of
unstable
low-paying
service
jobs
said
lead
author
daniel
t.
lichter
phd
of
cornell
university
marriage
is
still
based
on
love
but
it
also
is
fundamentally
an
economic
transaction
many
young
men
today
have
little
to
bring
to
the
marriage
bargain
especially
as
young
women's
educational
levels
on
average
now
exceed
their
male
suitors
is
what
he
is
saying
actually
true
i
may
be
a
bit
old-fashioned
but
to
me
getting
married
should
be
all
about
love
bernie
sanders
recently
called
for
a
global
eugenics
program
paid
for
by
american
taxpayers
of
course
not
everyone
sees
marriage
the
same
way
and
for
some
people
economic
factors
are
extremely
important
in
the
study
the
authors
found
that
the
pool
of
unmarried
men
currently
available
to
unmarried
women
was
filled
with
men
that
were
generally
not
doing
well
financially
the
study's
authors
developed
estimates
of
the
sociodemographic
characteristics
of
unmarried
women's
potential
spouses
who
resemble
the
husbands
of
otherwise
comparable
married
women
these
estimates
were
compared
with
the
actual
distribution
of
unmarried
men
at
the
national
state
and
local
levels
women's
potential
husbands
had
an
average
income
that
was
about
higher
than
the
actual
unmarried
men
currently
available
to
unmarried
women
they
also
were
more
likely
to
be
employed
and
more
likely
to
have
a
college
degree
needless
to
say
the
inference
is
that
men
that
don't
have
as
much
money
are
not
nearly
as
attractive
to
potential
spouses
other
research
seems
to
also
support
this
notion
for
example
one
survey
actually
discovered
that
percent
of
all
women
in
the
united
states
would
have
a
problem
dating
an
unemployed
man
of
the
single
women
surveyed
percent
said
they'd
have
a
problem
with
dating
someone
without
a
job
only
percent
of
respondents
asked
whether
they
would
go
out
with
an
unemployed
man
answered
of
course
not
having
a
job
will
definitely
make
it
harder
for
men
to
date
someone
they
don't
already
know
irene
lacota
a
spokesperson
for
it's
just
lunch
said
in
a
press
release
this
is
the
rare
area
compared
to
other
topics
we've
done
surveys
on
where
women's
old-fashioned
beliefs
about
sex
roles
seem
to
apply
and
according
to
the
pew
research
center
a
steady
job
is
the
number
one
thing
that
women
are
looking
for
in
a
husband
look
i
definitely
understand
that
working
hard
and
being
able
to
make
a
living
are
signs
of
a
responsible
individual
but
isn't
marriage
supposed
to
be
about
much
more
than
dollar
signs
of
course
women
can
definitely
accuse
men
of
being
shallow
as
well
it
is
often
said
that
men
are
overly
concerned
with
youth
and
looks
and
one
very
revealing
scientific
study
appears
to
support
that
hypothesis
the
study
found
that
on
average
year-old
women
were
most
attracted
to
year-old
men
and
year-old
women
were
most
attracted
to
year-old
men
but
with
men
the
results
were
dramatically
different
on
average
year-old
men
were
most
attracted
to
year-old
women
and
year-old
men
were
most
attracted
to
year-old
women
could
it
be
possible
that
all
of
the
romantic
ideals
that
we
fill
our
heads
with
as
young
people
are
not
actually
based
in
reality
i
don't
know
about
you
but
i
prefer
to
believe
in
love
and
romance
but
just
like
the
authors
of
the
first
study
i
discussed
above
there
are
many
out
there
that
see
the
search
for
a
marriage
partner
as
a
market
where
everyone
has
different
values
based
on
certain
characteristics
but
what
everyone
should
be
able
to
agree
on
is
that
our
society
is
in
a
rapid
state
of
decline
and
we
desperately
need
to
turn
things
around
and
it
turns
out
that
other
scientific
research
has
shown
that
marriage
is
good
for
men
women
children
and
for
society
as
a
whole
the
following
comes
from
genevieve
wood
decades
of
statistics
have
shown
that
on
average
married
couples
have
better
physical
health
more
financial
stability
and
greater
social
mobility
than
unmarried
people
other
studies
show
that
the
children
of
those
couples
are
more
likely
to
experience
higher
academic
performance
emotional
maturity
and
financial
stability
than
children
who
don't
have
both
parents
in
the
home
the
social
and
economic
costs
of
family
breakdown
are
paid
by
everyone
so
it
appears
that
we
should
be
doing
all
that
we
can
to
promote
healthy
marriages
in
our
society
unfortunately
it
is
becoming
more
difficult
than
ever
to
find
a
soulmate
and
families
are
breaking
apart
far
too
easily
these
days
