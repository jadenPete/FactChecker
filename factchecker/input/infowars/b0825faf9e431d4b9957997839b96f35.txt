this
is
it
repeal
of
the
second
amendment
is
coming
dems
believe
whether
they
get
it
done
or
not
they
sure
as
hell
are
trying
and
it
will
spark
biggest
civil
war
world
has
ever
seen
alex
jones
breaks
down
how
the
democrats
believe
they
are
at
the
cusp
of
permanently
repealing
the
second
amendment
in
a
prelude
to
their
world
government
takeover
but
fail
to
realize
that
stripping
americans
of
one
of
their
most
important
god-given
liberties
will
backfire
and
ultimately
push
the
country
into
a
civil
the
likes
of
which
the
world
has
never
seen
before
democratic
candidates
like
beto
o'rourke
have
openly
called
for
gun
confiscation
and
the
new
york
times
has
written
several
op-eds
justifying
ending
the
second
amendment
the
city
of
san
fransisco
has
also
labeled
the
national
rifle
association
as
a
domestic
terror
organization
despite
the
fact
no
mass
shooter
had
any
ties
to
the
gun
rights
organization
the
reality
is
violent
crime
has
steadily
decreased
in
the
u.s.
since
according
to
fbi
statistics
additionally
statistician
john
lott
of
the
crime
prevention
research
center
extensively
documented
the
national
crime
rate
in
conjunction
with
the
percentage
of
americans
who
concealed
carry
and
found
that
violent
crime
has
decreased
as
concealed
carry
permits
rose
lott
also
found
that
crime
was
lower
in
the
areas
where
law-abiding
citizens
armed
themselves
versus
places
where
gun
control
measures
were
enacted
for
example
the
high-crime
city
of
detroit
michigan
saw
a
drop
in
violent
crime
after
pro-second
amendment
police
chief
james
craig
took
control
of
the
police
department
in
he
bolstered
police
forces
and
encouraged
citizens
to
protect
themselves
with
firearms
which
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
violent
crimes
by
double
digits
unfortunately
despite
this
data
the
trump
administration
has
even
indicated
it
may
go
along
with
a
plan
to
have
big
tech
systematically
determine
who
is
fit
to
own
a
gun
based
not
on
the
courts
but
in
arbitrary
indicators
of
mental
health
by
the
deep
state's
harpa
project
