as
the
nfl
season
begins
the
social
decay
in
nfl
cities
is
worse
than
ever
of
course
the
same
thing
is
happening
in
just
about
every
other
major
city
around
the
country
this
year
america
is
celebrating
the
th
anniversary
of
the
nfl
every
week
millions
of
us
will
gather
around
our
televisions
to
watch
extremely
well
paid
young
men
throw
a
football
around
i
love
football
myself
and
i
am
hoping
for
a
really
good
season
but
while
these
highly
paid
teams
are
playing
in
some
of
the
most
beautiful
sports
stadiums
in
the
entire
world
the
cities
that
they
represent
are
rapidly
falling
apart
all
around
them
from
coast
to
coast
major
u.s.
cities
are
rapidly
being
transformed
into
rotting
decaying
hellholes
and
it
is
getting
worse
with
each
passing
year
let's
start
by
looking
at
baltimore
on
sunday
the
baltimore
ravens
absolutely
crushed
the
miami
dolphins
and
lamar
jackson
looks
poised
to
have
an
absolutely
fabulous
season
but
meanwhile
the
city
of
baltimore
itself
is
a
drug-infested
nightmare
that
could
potentially
set
a
new
all-time
record
for
homicides
in
president
trump
recently
made
national
headlines
for
calling
it
a
disgusting
rat
and
rodent
infested
mess
and
it
is
being
reported
that
he
will
actually
visit
the
city
on
thursday
today
baltimore
has
literally
become
one
of
the
most
dangerous
areas
on
the
entire
planet
in
fact
there
is
only
one
country
in
the
entire
world
that
has
a
higher
per
capita
homicide
rate
than
baltimore
of
course
baltimore
is
definitely
not
alone
every
individual
listener
of
the
alex
jones
show
can
take
action
and
show
support
for
the
liberty
movement
by
directly
supporting
those
brave
enough
to
carry
the
show
on
sunday
the
los
angeles
rams
and
the
los
angeles
chargers
that
still
doesn't
sound
right
to
me
both
won
their
first
games
but
the
city
they
represent
is
literally
degenerating
right
in
front
of
our
eyes
thanks
to
a
rapidly
growing
homeless
population
and
the
worst
rat
epidemic
the
city
has
ever
seen
health
authorities
are
having
to
deal
with
outbreaks
of
typhoid
fever
and
leprosy
once
upon
a
time
los
angeles
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cities
in
the
world
but
now
dr
drew
pinsky
is
warning
that
rats
have
taken
over
the
city
you
would
think
that
the
lawmakers
in
sacramento
would
do
something
to
help
clean
up
los
angeles
but
sacramento
itself
is
quickly
turning
into
a
cesspool
when
salon
owner
liz
novak
went
on
twitter
and
explained
why
she
felt
forced
to
relocate
her
business
it
quickly
got
the
attention
of
quite
a
few
national
media
outlets
i
have
to
say
that
i
agree
with
her
if
people
were
pooping
and
peeing
on
my
doorstep
i
would
move
too
speaking
of
human
poop
there
is
so
much
of
it
in
the
streets
of
philadelphia
that
it
has
fueled
an
alarming
outbreak
of
hepatitis
a
cases
the
eagles
may
have
beaten
the
hapless
redskins
on
sunday
but
the
city
that
they
represent
is
literally
becoming
a
toilet
it
is
easy
to
pick
on
philadelphia
because
it
is
one
of
the
poorest
run
major
cities
in
the
entire
nation
according
to
one
local
official
there
is
so
much
human
feces
on
the
ground
it's
unbelievable
of
course
the
same
thing
is
happening
in
just
about
every
other
major
city
around
the
country
the
worst
drug
crisis
in
american
history
has
resulted
in
hordes
of
homeless
addicts
mindlessly
wandering
about
as
they
search
for
a
way
to
get
their
next
fix
as
a
nation
we
need
to
fundamentally
reject
the
way
that
we
have
been
doing
things
and
we
need
to
start
running
in
the
other
direction
as
fast
as
we
can
sports
has
an
important
role
to
play
in
our
society
but
when
just
a
handful
of
people
are
paid
millions
of
dollars
to
play
while
millions
upon
millions
of
other
citizens
are
wallowing
in
poverty
despair
and
addiction
that
is
a
sign
that
things
have
gotten
very
seriously
out
of
balance
our
nation
is
deeply
broken
and
it
is
getting
worse
with
each
passing
day
if
we
ever
want
to
fix
things
we
need
to
wake
up
and
start
focusing
on
the
things
that
really
matter
