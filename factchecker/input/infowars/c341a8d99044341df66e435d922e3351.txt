study
the
only
place
on
earth
more
surveilled
than
london
is
communist
china
there
is
no
correlation
between
safety
and
surveillance
a
new
study
by
research
website
comparitech
has
found
that
london
is
the
th
most
surveilled
city
on
the
planet
with
the
top
five
cities
all
being
in
communist
china
the
study
looked
at
cities
globally
and
found
that
the
top
ten
with
most
public
cctv
cameras
per
inhabitants
were
practically
all
in
china
central
chinese
city
chongqing
tops
the
list
with
public
cameras
per
inhabitants
the
study
found
that
by
china
is
projected
to
have
one
public
cctv
camera
for
every
two
people
another
four
chinese
cities
including
shanghai
make
up
the
top
five
and
then
it's
london
with
cameras
per
inhabitants
the
us
city
of
atlanta
comes
in
at
number
just
behind
beijing
in
considering
china's
mass
surveillance
the
study
notes
that
that
could
never
happen
in
london
though
right
wrong
between
and
london
metropolitan
police
used
facial
recognition
cameras
indiscriminately
around
kings
cross
station
and
only
stopped
when
legal
challenges
were
made
it
is
not
yet
known
how
the
images
from
the
cameras
were
used
so
with
that
amount
of
cameras
in
london
it
must
be
one
of
the
safest
places
on
the
planet
right
lol
no
comparitech
said
that
they
found
no
connection
between
lower
crime
rates
or
a
heightened
feeling
of
security
and
surveillance
in
the
cities
surveyed
that'll
explain
all
the
stabbings
last
year
was
london's
bloodiest
in
a
decade
when
the
number
of
homicides
reached
and
the
violence
continues
to
plague
the
capital
with
set
to
eclipse
that
record
as
of
september
there
have
been
violent
deaths
in
the
capital
twenty
teens
have
been
killed
in
the
capital
this
year
of
whom
were
fatally
stabbed
but
london
mayor
sadiq
khan
says
the
city
is
open
open
to
record
violence
and
communist
chinese
levels
of
surveillance
nice
