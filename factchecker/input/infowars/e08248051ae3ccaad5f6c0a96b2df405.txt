ex-obama
official
dems
going
way
too
far
to
the
left
on
immigration
says
extreme
stance
will
lead
to
loss
former
homeland
security
secretary
jeh
johnson
cautioned
democrats
on
pivoting
too
far
to
the
left
on
immigration
issues
warning
that
it
could
cost
them
in
the
election
look
most
americans
want
to
be
fair
and
treated
in
a
humane
way
those
who
have
migrated
here
who
are
desperate
who
are
fleeing
really
bad
conditions
we
want
to
take
care
of
the
dreamers
but
americans
also
want
secure
borders
they
want
to
get
control
of
illegal
migration
johnson
who
served
as
dhs
secretary
during
the
obama
administration
said
wednesday
on
msnbc's
morning
joe
so
when
we
talk
about
deprioritizing
the
deportation
of
those
apprehended
at
the
border
or
decriminalizing
illegal
immigration
i
know
that
we're
going
way
too
far
to
the
left
of
the
american
consensus
on
where
we
should
be
on
this
and
you
just
cannot
have
a
policy
where
a
border
patrol
agent
arrests
someone
at
the
border
and
says
in
effect
you
get
to
stay
here
unless
you
commit
a
crime
johnson
continued
johnson
identified
himself
as
a
loyal
democrat
who
wants
to
see
his
party
win
in
the
next
election
but
he
suggested
that
the
positions
taken
by
many
democratic
presidential
contenders
do
not
appeal
to
a
wide
consensus
of
americans
the
comments
were
a
sharp
rebuke
to
the
leftward
swing
seen
by
democratic
presidential
candidates
hillary
clinton
and
elizabeth
warren's
recent
secret
meetings
have
sparked
the
possibility
of
the
failed
politician
sabotaging
the
election
for
the
democrats
by
re-entering
the
arena
many
of
the
candidates
vying
to
oust
president
donald
trump
have
espoused
support
for
decriminalizing
illegal
entry
into
the
u.s.
nearly
all
of
the
presidential
candidates
participating
at
the
second
debate
in
july
for
example
raised
their
hand
when
asked
if
they
supported
such
a
policy
change
former
hud
secretary
julian
castro
in
particular
not
only
wants
to
see
illegal
entry
decriminalized
but
he
also
wants
to
decriminalize
illegal
re-entry
a
crime
that
is
punishable
by
at
least
two
years
in
prison
johnson
had
already
criticized
the
idea
publicly
saying
it
was
tantamount
to
having
open
borders
that
just
simply
incentivizes
more
illegal
immigration
we
lose
control
of
our
borders
in
the
same
vein
by
taking
a
formal
step
of
decriminalizing
illegal
migration
what
we're
saying
as
a
country
or
society
is
we're
prepared
to
see
a
lot
more
of
this
johnson
said
wednesday
when
you
decriminalize
something
it's
because
society
is
prepared
to
see
that
behavior
perhaps
regulated
but
en
masse
i
don't
think
that's
where
the
american
people
are
james
clyburn
in
defending
biden
from
warren's
attacks
admitted
that
not
only
could
the
bill
of
rights
not
be
passed
today
but
most
people
want
the
st
nd
repealed
