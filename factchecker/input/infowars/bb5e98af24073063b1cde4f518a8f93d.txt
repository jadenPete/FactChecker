this
all

if
you
allow
the

to
control
the
language
they
control
the
narrative
the
left
has
defined
what
a
mass

is
they
need
to
be
held

that
standard
the

met
no

it's
also
notable
that
current
gun
control
proposals
would
not
have
prevented
parnell
from
illegally
obtaining
a
firearm
how
did
he
pass
the
background
check
did
his
parents
allow
him
to
buy
the
gun

good
thing
there
was
a
law
in
place
preventing
year-olds
from
carrying
a
firearm
in
public
laws
against
such
things
stop

congressional
democrats
have
vowed
to
bring
forward
gun
control
legislation
to
the
floor
when
they
return
from
recess
in
september
could
the
red
flag
laws
used
to
keep
mentally
ill
citizens
from
attaining
firearms
be
used
to
deem
