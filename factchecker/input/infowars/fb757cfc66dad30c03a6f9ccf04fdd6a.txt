surging
homeless
population
in
los

could
spark
increase
in
leprosy
more
cases
starting
to
emerge
with
typhoid
fever
and
even
the
return
of
the
bubonic
plague
already
big
concerns
increasing
homelessness
in
los
angeles
could
also
spark
an
increase
in
leprosy
according
to
a
new
study
more
leprosy
cases
are
starting
to
emerge
in
los
angeles
county
with
dr
maria
teresa
ochoa
of
the
university
of
southern
california
urging
the
public
to
fight
the
stigma
leprosy
which
is
spread
through
the
air
but
must
involve
close
contact
can
cause
permanent
blindness
severe
damage
to
the
body's
skin
nerves
and
mucous
membranes
as
well
as
deformities
although
victims
can
make
full
recoveries
if
they
receive
early
diagnoses
most
of
los
angeles
homeless
population
who
are
at
risk
will
not
get
swift
treatment
owen
shroyer
and
will
johnson
join
the
alex
jones
show
to
expose
the
violent
mindless
zombies
allowed
to
roam
the
streets
as
leprosy
has
been
a
neglected
disease
with
a
high
potential
to
cause
deformities
especially
when
it
is
not
treated
properly
i
would
like
to
reinforce
the
need
for
early
identification
of
cases
in
the
community
with
the
adoption
of
active
case
search
and
screening
of
household
and
social
contacts
from
all
index
cases
dr
victor
s.
santos
told
reuters
earlier
this
year
dr
drew
pinsky
said
the
public
health
situation
in
america's
second
largest
city
was
in
utter
turmoil
we
have
a
complete
breakdown
of
the
basic
needs
of
civilization
in
los
angeles
right
now
said
pinsky
dr
nick
begich
breaks
down
the
reasons
and
effects
of
the
global
homeless
epidemic
per
cent
of
rats
in
l.a.
now
carry
bubonic
plague
if
that
figures
hits
per
cent
the
medieval
disease
will
start
jumping
to
humans
in
other
words
if
la
doesn't
sort
out
its
trash
problem
and
its
homeless
problem
the
return
of
bubonic
plague
is
virtually
guaranteed
as
we
document
in
the
video
below
l.a.
s
homeless
population
vast
amounts
of
uncollected
trash
and
million
rats
have
all
combined
to
make
the
city
increasingly
resemble
a
