where
is
the
outrage
over
opioid
carnage
left
too
busy
politicizing
shootings
to
notice
the
hundreds
of
thousands
killed
by
foreign-made
fentanyl
statistically
the
amount
of
deaths
by
opioids
is
a
far
larger
crisis
than
the
politicized
second
amendment
threatening
mass
shootings
epidemic
the
united
states
endures
in
fact
pharmaceutical
companies
and
the
drug
trade
dwarf
gun
violence
so
massively
that
the
two
aren't
even
in
the
same
ballpark
yet
democratic
politicians
and
mainstream
media
funded
by
the
pharmaceutical
companies
target
the
fundamental
rights
of
law
abiding
citizens
by
politicizing
gun
violence
over
opioid
deaths
as
a
clamp
down
of
corpracratic
dominance
steers
the
future
of
our
republic
