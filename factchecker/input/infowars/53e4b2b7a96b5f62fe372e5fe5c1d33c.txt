joel

joins

via

to
break
down
why
president
trump
must
act
wisely
to
avoid
global
catastrophe
several
reports
have
suggested
various
destinations
for
the
ship
including
turkey
and
greece
but
nothing
has
been
confirmed
so
far
the
us
which
is
seeking
the
arrest
of
the
iranian
vessel
warned
that
any
state
or
business
harboring
or
assisting
the
adrian
darya
may
have
sanctions
levied

overseas
territory
gibraltar
on

over
a
tip
from

that
it
was
carrying
a
shipment
of
crude

the
claims

arrest

accused
london
of
piracy

said
the

detention
is
a
violation

the
iran
nuclear
deal
the
vessel
was
released
on

after
more
than
a
month-long
detention
and
ventured
further
into
the
mediterranean
changing
its
name
from
grace
to
adrian
darya
the
us
unsuccessfully
tried
to
prevent
that
by
issuing
an
arrest
warrant
hastily
filed
with
a
sloppy
mistake
and
still
hopes
to
detain
the
vessel
and
its
cargo
