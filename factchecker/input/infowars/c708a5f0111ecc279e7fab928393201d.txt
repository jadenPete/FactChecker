the
high
price
of
a
free
lunch
printing
money
isn't
really
any
less
costly
than
taxation
one
of
the
ten
commandments
is
thou
shalt
not
steal
and
theft
is
generally
condemned
in
most
religions
yet
our
religious
leaders
and
followers
have
essentially
turned
a
blind
eye
to
government
theft
based
on
a
policy
of
envy
bernie
sanders
for
example
has
bluntly
stated
he
intends
to
tax
the
rich
to
fund
his
programs
as
though
the
word
rich
itself
justifies
theft
the
current
crop
of
other
democratic
candidates
is
offering
a
beehive
of
free
programs
without
any
real
discussion
on
how
to
pay
for
them
three
ways
to
pay
for
the
stategovernments
can
finance
these
programs
in
only
three
ways
direct
taxation
of
its
citizens
borrowing
money
and
or
printing
money
few
citizens
understand
the
nefarious
effects
these
methods
can
have
on
their
own
well-being
none
of
them
provide
free
money
the
first
and
most
obvious
way
to
raise
money
is
by
direct
taxation
when
you
pay
your
income
tax
or
sales
tax
you
are
brutally
aware
of
how
much
money
is
being
taken
out
of
your
own
pocket
if
the
government
only
uses
these
taxes
to
fund
itself
it
would
quickly
run
into
serious
taxpayer
opposition
would
we
still
be
in
afghanistan
today
if
the
government
took
your
flat-screen
tv
or
cell
phone
to
pay
for
soldiers
half
a
world
away
the
second
way
to
raise
money
is
by
government
borrowing
when
the
government
borrows
it
takes
money
from
people
who
are
trying
to
save
promising
a
seemingly
riskless
asset
a
government
bond
the
government
has
displaced
money
that
would
normally
have
been
used
to
invest
in
a
new
computer
or
machines
or
buildings
or
even
a
consumption
good
as
a
new
car
when
the
government
borrows
there
are
real
sacrifices
today
not
in
some
distant
never
existing
future
when
the
debt
is
repaid
there
are
real
resources
that
are
extracted
from
the
economy
in
the
now
and
present
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
is
seen
what
is
not
seen
and
what
should
be
foreseen
government
borrowing
finances
government
consumption
which
crowds
out
investment
spending
that
would
normally
have
created
a
more
prosperous
economy
government
crowds
out
other
borrowersnow
government
borrowing
is
normally
also
constrained
the
more
the
government
borrows
the
greater
the
demand
for
loanable
funds
and
the
higher
the
rate
of
interest
here
again
taxpayers
who
are
also
trying
to
borrow
to
buy
a
car
or
a
house
would
soon
realize
that
it's
the
government
borrowing
that
is
crowding
them
out
of
the
loan
market
of
course
there
is
a
point
of
no
return
for
government
debt
when
the
markets
doubt
a
country's
ability
to
repay
this
debt
as
greece
discovered
in
now
the
obvious
question
is
how
can
the
us
or
any
other
country
run
record
budget
deficits
and
have
rock-bottom
interest
rates
at
the
same
time
the
answer
is
the
third
way
by
printing
money
or
often
called
quantitative
easing
this
way
also
impacts
the
government's
ability
to
borrow
a
simple
example
will
make
this
path
of
funding
clearer
suppose
an
economy
has
to
purchase
pencils
the
price
of
the
pencils
will
be
each
if
the
price
increases
inflates
to
each
while
the
supply
remains
constant
there
would
be
pencils
that
can't
be
purchased
but
if
the
cost
of
the
pencils
were
reduced
deflated
to
only
each
there
would
be
people
holding
looking
to
purchase
nonexistent
pencils
supply
and
demand
in
the
marketplace
give
us
a
price
of
per
pencil
now
suppose
the
economy
is
growing
and
is
now
producing
pencils
because
there
are
now
more
pencils
in
the
supply
pipeline
the
price
of
pencils
will
drop
to
a
deflation
rate
of
deflation
here
reflects
society
pushing
back
the
constraint
of
scarcity
it
cannot
eliminate
scarcity
or
all
prices
would
be
zero
but
this
deflation
shows
an
increase
in
the
standard
of
living
for
everyone
two
of
the
greatest
periods
of
gdp
growth
in
the
us
to
and
to
had
deflations
of
deflation
should
be
hailed
instead
of
being
scorned
as
it
is
currently
by
most
professional
economists
and
central
bankers
now
returning
to
our
initial
example
of
and
pencils
suppose
the
government
prints
another
to
buy
pencils
but
our
supply
of
pencils
has
not
changed
the
money
supply
has
doubled
so
we
now
have
chasing
pencils
the
price
for
each
pencil
will
inflate
to
and
the
government
will
be
able
to
buy
pencils
by
cutting
the
purchasing
power
of
money
in
half
in
other
words
you
have
been
robbed
or
taxed
pencils
because
your
cash
can
now
purchase
less
than
before
if
at
the
same
time
the
economy
is
growing
then
we
would
have
chasing
pencils
and
the
price
of
pencils
would
have
remained
at
there
is
no
inflation
but
the
rise
in
real
income
exemplified
by
the
pencils
that
would
normally
have
gone
to
the
citizenry
has
been
siphoned
off
or
stolen
by
the
government
to
a
large
degree
this
is
what
has
been
happening
since
we
moved
to
a
fiat
currency
system
in
the
central
bank
has
been
keeping
the
cpi
in
check
but
has
created
massive
asset
inflation
a
massive
redistribution
of
income
from
the
poor
to
the
rich
and
has
been
a
major
contributor
to
financing
ever-growing
government
expenditures
as
lord
keynes
said
by
a
continuing
process
of
inflation
governments
can
confiscate
secretly
and
unobserved
an
important
part
of
the
wealth
of
their
citizens
by
this
method
they
not
only
confiscate
but
they
confiscate
arbitrarily
and
while
the
process
impoverishes
many
it
actually
enriches
some
the
sight
of
this
arbitrary
rearrangement
of
riches
strikes
not
only
at
security
but
at
confidence
in
the
equity
of
the
existing
distribution
of
wealth
many
in
the
lower
rungs
of
the
economic
ladder
blame
their
declining
real
incomes
and
other
inequities
on
capitalism
they
should
instead
be
blaming
the
central
bank
when
the
government
borrows
it
increases
the
demand
for
loanable
funds
and
with
a
fixed
supply
interest
rates
should
normally
rise
if
at
the
same
time
the
central
bank
is
increasing
the
supply
of
loanable
funds
by
printing
money
to
buy
government
bonds
then
interest
rates
will
decline
if
the
increase
in
supply
is
greater
than
the
increase
in
demand
here
we
are
basically
monetizing
the
debt
worldwide
this
printing
has
currently
driven
interest
rates
to
zero
or
into
negative
territory
using
the
economy
as
an
excuse
central
banks
have
been
monetizing
government
debt
alleviating
any
pressure
on
governments
to
control
their
spending
continuing
from
keynes
as
the
inflation
proceeds
and
the
real
value
of
the
currency
fluctuates
wildly
from
month
to
month
all
permanent
relations
between
debtors
and
creditors
which
form
the
ultimate
foundation
of
capitalism
become
so
utterly
disordered
as
to
be
almost
meaningless
and
the
process
of
wealth-getting
degenerates
into
a
gamble
and
a
lottery
lenin
was
certainly
right
there
is
no
subtler
no
surer
means
of
overturning
the
existing
basis
of
society
than
to
debauch
the
currency
the
process
engages
all
the
hidden
forces
of
economic
law
on
the
side
of
destruction
and
does
it
in
a
manner
which
not
one
man
in
a
million
is
able
to
diagnose
many
economists
are
currently
predicting
we
will
experience
another
devastating
recession
in
the
us
will
we
repeat
the
errors
of
the
past
by
trying
to
fix
a
credit
crisis
with
more
debt
or
will
we
find
a
permanent
solution
by
ending
central
banking
fractional
reserve
banking
and
the
government's
ability
to
borrow
and
print
money
if
we
do
any
future
government
spending
would
require
an
immediate
and
clear
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
citizenry
unlike
what
politicians
would
have
you
believe
there
is
no
free
lunch
