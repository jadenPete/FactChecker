kavanaugh
accuser's
attorney
admits
protecting
abortion
was
part
of
her
motivation
to
derail
confirmation
video
suggests
christine
blasey
ford
may
have
committed
perjury
before
the
senate
in
nearly
a
year
after
the
politically-charged
confirmation
hearings
of
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
the
truth
about
the
left's
crusade
to
take
him
down
is
becoming
clear
video
footage
of
christine
blasey
ford's
lawyer
debra
katz
shows
her
saying
that
protecting
abortion
was
part
of
what
motivated
ford
to
publicly
accuse
kavanaugh
of
sexual
impropriety
against
her
during
the
s
in
the
aftermath
of
these
hearings
i
believe
that
christine's
testimony
brought
about
more
good
than
the
harm
misogynist
republicans
caused
by
allowing
kavanaugh
on
the
court
katz
says
in
the
video
he
will
always
have
an
asterisk
next
to
his
name
when
he
takes
a
scalpel
to
roe
v
wade
we
will
know
who
he
is
we
know
his
character
and
we
know
what
motivates
him
and
that
is
important
it
is
important
that
we
know
and
that
is
part
of
what
motivated
christine
this
revelation
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
ford's
own
explanation
for
her
coming
forward
with
these
serious
accusations
in
september
ford
testified
under
oath
in
her
opening
statement
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
she
was
compelled
by
her
civic
duty
to
allege
sexual
assault
against
kavanaugh
just
before
he
was
confirmed
as
a
supreme
court
justice
dr
christine
blasey
ford
explains
she's
not
testifying
because
she
wants
to
but
because
it's
her
civic
duty

author
ryan
lovelace
who
wrote
search
and
destroy
inside
the
campaign
against
brett
kavanaugh
said
that
the
outcome
of
the
hearings
may
have
been
different
had
this
information
been
known
to
congress
i
think
if
we
knew
in
september
what
we
know
now
there
would
have
been
all
kinds
of
questions
at
the
hearing
about
this
he
told
the
daily
caller
the
author
said
he
believes
there
will
be
more
scrutiny
going
forward
saying
that
this
is
part
of
the
reason
he
penned
search
and
destroy
christine
blasey
ford
has
been
caught
in
several
lies
during
her
testimony
given
to
the
senate
she
claimed
she
has
a
fear
of
flying
and
that
she
had
never
been
coached
on
taking
a
polygraph
both
claims
that
have
been
proven
false
also
others
have
sworn
statements
that
refute
her
version
of
events
