as
the

the
mainstream

is
suddenly
full
of
stories
about
the
coming
recession
after
several
years
of
relative
economic
stability
things
appear
to
be
changing
dramatically
for
the
u.s.
economy
and
the
global
economy
as
a
whole
over
and
over
again
we
are
seeing
things
happen
that
we
have
not
witnessed
since
the
last
recession
and
many
analysts
expect
our
troubles
to
accelerate
as
we
head
into
the
final
months
of
we
should
certainly
hope
that
things
will
soon
turn
around
but
at
this
point
that
does
not
appear
likely
the
following
are
signs
of
economic

last
six
months
when

before
the

uncertainty
index
hit
the
highest
level
that
we
have
ever
seen
in
the
month
of
june
americans
are
searching
google
for
the
term
recession
more
frequently
than
we
have
seen
at
any
time
since
the
signs
are
very
clear
but
unfortunately
we
live
at
a
time
when
normalcy
bias
is
rampant
in
our
society
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
normalcy
bias
the
following
is
how
wikipedia
defines
it
the
normalcy
bias
or
normality
bias
is
a
belief
people
hold
when
considering
the
possibility
of
a
disaster
it
causes
people
to
underestimate
both
the
likelihood
of
a
disaster
and
its
possible
effects
because
people
believe
that
things
will
always
function
the
way
things
normally
have
functioned
this
may
result
in
situations
where
people
fail
to
adequately
prepare
themselves
for
disasters
and
on
a
larger
scale
the
failure
of
governments
to
include
the
populace
in
its
disaster
preparations
about
of
people
reportedly
display
normalcy
bias
in
disasters
for
most
americans
the
crisis
of
and
is
now
a
distant
memory
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
population
seems
confident
that
brighter
days
are
ahead
even
if
we
must
weather
a
short-term
economic
recession
first
as
a
result
most
people
are
not
preparing
for
a
major
economic
crisis
and
that
makes
us
extremely
vulnerable
in
and
the
horrible
financial
crisis
and
the
bitter
recession
that
followed
took
most
americans
completely
by
surprise
it
will
be
the
same
this
time
around
even
though
the
warning
signs
are
there
for
all
to
see
