britain's
prime
minister
is
running
out
of
options
to
take
the
uk
out
of
the
european
union
in
line
with
his
do
or
die
brexit
strategy
as
opposition
parties
want
a
no-deal
brexit
blocked
before
they
agree
to
a
snap
election
boris
johnson
is
eager
to
defy
lawmakers
demands
that
he
ask
brussels
for
another
brexit
delay
despite
parliament
supporting
a
motion
that
would
legally
bind
him
to
do
so
speaking
to
reporters
at
a
farm
in
scotland
on
friday
the
prime
minister
said
he
won't
carry
out
parliament's
instructions
to
seek
a
three-month
article
extension
if
there
is
no
deal
in
place
by
the
october
deadline
he
added
that
he
was
only
bound
in
theory
by
the
would-be
law
which
he
called
undemocratic
johnson
said
the
bill
that
is
still
before
parliament
would
in
theory
mean
that
the
government
of
the
uk
was
obliged
to
write
a
letter
to
brussels
asking
for
a
pointless
delay
to
leaving
the
eu
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
people
want
i
don't
think
that's
what
people
want
and
i
think
we
were
very
clear
about
that
and
not
only
would
it
oblige
the
government
to
do
that
it
would
give
the
eu
the
power
to
decide
how
long
the
uk
had
to
stay
in
and
i
really
can't
think
for
the
life
of
me
that
that
is
a
democratic
way
forward
he
added
asked
if
that
meant
he
would
not
ask
the
eu
to
postpone
brexit
again
he
said
i
will
not
i
don't
want
a
delay
the
bill
has
passed
through
both
chambers
of
parliament
and
is
due
to
get
formal
approval
from
the
queen
on
monday
after
which
it
will
become
law
failure
to
comply
with
the
law
could
trigger
legal
action
against
boris
johnson
for
contempt
and
possibly
even
see
him
jailed
what
can
johnson
do
to
defy
the
opposition
whether
johnson
is
in
a
position
to
defy
the
law
remains
unclear
his
government
lost
a
working
majority
in
parliament
this
week
after
a
conservative
mp's
defection
to
the
liberal
democrats
so
he
asked
legislators
to
support
a
snap
general
election
in
a
bid
to
regain
control
over
parliament
but
opposition
lawmakers
along
with
rebel
tory
mps
voted
down
his
plans
and
instead
passed
the
bill
mandating
the
prime
minister
to
ask
for
a
brexit
delay
to
prevent
no-deal
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
said
his
party
would
not
support
a
general
election
until
johnson
promises
to
adhere
to
the
law
we
need
a
clear
statement
from
the
prime
minister
that
he
is
going
to
abide
by
that
act
of
parliament
corbyn
said
on
saturday
johnson
ruled
out
resigning
to
avoid
asking
for
an
extension
saying
he
would
stay
in
office
to
deliver
brexit
and
defeat
corbyn
johnson
could
also
step
down
as
prime
minister
but
not
as
tory
leader
to
force
an
early
election
but
he
said
it
was
not
a
hypothesis
i'm
willing
to
contemplate
in
an
extraordinary
turn
of
events
johnson
could
call
a
no-confidence
vote
in
himself
which
would
trigger
an
early
election
if
he
were
to
lose
under
one
important
condition
which
is
that
opposition
parties
are
unable
to
form
a
government
within
days
corbyn
said
he
would
support
a
snap
election
if
a
no-deal
brexit
is
ruled
out
so
the
prime
minister
is
expected
to
trigger
a
poll
again
on
monday
and
call
an
election
for
october
the
motion
will
need
a
two-thirds
majority
to
pass
