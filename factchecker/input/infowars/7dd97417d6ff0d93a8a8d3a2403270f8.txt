a
pulitzer
prize-nominated
author
is
urging
all
normal
people
to
cease
wearing
red
baseball
caps
because
they
remind
her
of
the
trump-inspired
make
america
great
again
maga
hats
and
that
does
weird
sh-t
to
her
rebecca
makkai
asked
her
twitter
audience
on
sunday
is
anyone
else
made
really
uncomfortable
these
days
by
anyone
wearing
any
kind
of
red
baseball
cap
on
friday
twitter
enthusiasts
were
continuing
to
tell
her
that
no
they
weren't
but
that
maybe
makkai
should
assess
her
own
feelings
makkai
then
moved
to
her
central
thesis
that
the
maga
hat
has
reached
the
moral
equivalency
of
the
swastika
used
by
nazi
germany
she
suggested
that
the
red
hat
has
become
a
symbol
of
hate
because
of
how
its
wearers
act
read
more
leftists
commies
openly
fantasize
about
what
they
would
do
as
the
new
authoritarians
charged
with
punishing
conservatives
in
the
gulag
of
their
dreams
