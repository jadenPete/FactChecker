prime
minister
viktor
orban
said
in
a
speech
to
the
budapest
demographic
summit
iii
on
thursday
and
if
a
nation
disappears
something
irreplaceable
disappears
from
the
world
he
said
at
the
event
held
in
the
varkert
bazaar
where
he
said
one
of
the
state's
goals
and
the
government's
task
was
to
pursue
a
vigorous
demographic
policy
the
prime
minister
said
the
solution
of
immigration
and
the
mindless
green
argument
that
the
earth
would
be
better
off
with
fewer
births
were
off
the
table
when
it
came
to
the
issue
of
demography
he
said
hungary's
family
support
scheme
would
only
reach
a
turning
point
when
those
who
decide
to
have
children
enjoyed
a
higher
standard
of
living
than
if
they
had
opted
against
having
children
hungary's
family
policy
is
based
on
the
concept
and
conviction
that
every
child
has
a
right
to
have
a
father
and
a
mother
orban
said
and
that
a
family
and
children
are
prerequisites
of
the
biological
reproduction
of
a
national
community
the
hungarian
family
support
model
rests
on
a
foundation
that
has
a
constitutional
nature
orban
said
adding
that
this
was
essential
for
pursuing

these

protect

against

that
are
detrimental
to

against
attempts
by

the

good

needs
economic
foundations
as
well
orban
said
noting
that
allocations
in
the
central
budget
to
support
families
had
doubled
over
the
past
ten
years
the
prime
minister
highlighted
the
need
for
a
predictable
family
support
system
over
the
long
term
orban
said
the
key
to
the
success
of
hungary's
demographic
policy
was
christianity
regaining
its
strength
in

in
this
endeavor

as

commonsthe
prime
minister
said
the
demographic
policy's
success
would
be
ensured
if
the
country's
annual
economic
growth
rate
exceeded
the
eu
average
by
at

percent

orban
said
orban
said
there
was
abundant
skepticism
in
europe
as
to
whether
hungary
could
achieve
its
demographic
policy
goal
of
a
fertility
rate
but
those
people
said
the
same
before
about
other
hungarian
government
measures
such
as
sending
home
the
imf
introducing
a
banking
tax
and
a
progressive
income
tax
levying
a
tax
on
multinational
companies
cutting
utility
costs
creating
one
million
jobs
in
ten
years
stopping
migration
and
building
a
border
fence
he
added
addressing
the
summit
serbian
president
aleksandar
vucic
called
it
important
that
demographic
changes
were
being
addressed
as
one
of
today's
top
challenges
and
an
issue
that
calls
for
immediate
action
vucic
also
emphasized
the
gravity
of
europe's
demographic
woes
in
terms
of
the
future
of
central
europe
and
the
need
for
the
continent
as
a
whole
to
find
solutions
to
the
problem
he
said
serbia
was
ready
to
cooperate
with
hungary
and
the
other
central
european
countries
in
tackling
the
issue

the
effects
of

could
be
almost

those

as
a
means
of
promoting
population
growth
in
place
of
immigration
he
praised
hungary's
family

scheme
as
unique
saying
it
