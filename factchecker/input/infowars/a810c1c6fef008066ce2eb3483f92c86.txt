the
food

a
swedish
behavioral
scientist
has
suggested
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
turn
to
cannibalism
and
start
eating
humans
in
order
to
save
the
planet
appearing
on
swedish
television
to
talk
about
an
event
based
around
the
food
of
the
future
magnus
s
derlund
said
he
would
be
holding
seminars
on
the
necessity
of
consuming
human
flesh
in
order
to
stop
climate
change
environmentalists
blame
the
meat
and
farming
industry
for
a
large
part
of
what
they
claim
is
the
warming
of
the
earth
alex
jones
is
live
breaking
down
these
terrifying
developments
that
surpasses
the
nightmares
of
george
orwell
according
to
s
derlund
a
potential
fix
would
be
the
soylent
green-solution
of
eating
dead
bodies
instead
he
told
the
host
of
the
show
that
one
of
the
biggest
obstacles
to
the
proposal
would
be
the
taboo
nature
of
corpses
and
the
fact
that
many
would
see
it
as
defiling
the
deceased
s
derlund
also
acknowledged
that
people
are
slightly
conservative
when
it
comes
to
eating
things
they
are
not
accustomed
to
such
as
cadavers
the
discussion
took
place
accompanied
by
a
graphic
of
human
hands
on
the
end
of
forks
lovely
another
proposal
to
save
the
earth
which
has
been
promoted
by
numerous
mass
media
outlets
and
environmentalists
is
only
somewhat
less
disgusting
eating
bugs
no
doubt
greta
thunberg
and
prince
harry
will
be
first
in
line
for
when
cockroaches
and
human
flesh
is
being
dished
out
at
the
