ordered
a
fightback
against
los

soaring
homeless
problem
vowing
to
get
vagrants
off
the
streets
and
into
government
housing
facilities
plans
are
in
place
to
tackle
chronic
issues
with
trash
rats
sewage
problems
and
the
return
of
medieval
diseases
which
are
beginning
to
take
hold
in
major
cities
across
california
among
the
ideas
under
consideration
is
razing
existing
tent
camps
for
the
homeless
creating
new
temporary
facilities
or
refurbishing
existing
government
facilities
officials
told
the
washington

the
changes
would
give
the
federal
government
a
larger
role
in
supervising
housing
and
health
care
for
residents
according
to
the
report
back
in
july

news
tucker
carlson
of
his
plan
to
intervene
in
big
cities
like
la
and
san
francisco
where
feces
discarded
needles
and
trash
threaten
to
cause
a
public
health
crisis
you
can't
have
what's
happening
where
police
officers
are
getting
sick
just
by
walking
the
beat
i
mean
they're
getting
actually
very
sick
where
people
are
getting
sick
where
the
people
living
there
living
in
hell
too
said
trump
we
cannot
ruin
our
cities
and
you
have
people
that
work
in
those
cities
they
work
in
office
buildings
and
to
get
into
the
building
they
have
to
walk
through
a
scene
that
nobody
would
have
believed
possible
three
years
ago
according
to
los
angeles
mayor
eric
garcetti
aide
breelyn
pete
a
large
delegation
of
trump
administration
officials
already
visited
the
city
to
discuss
the
crackdown
earlier
this
year
dr
drew
pinsky
said
the
public
health
situation
in
america's
second
largest
city
was
in
utter
turmoil
we
have
a
complete
breakdown
of
the
basic
needs
of
civilization
in
los
angeles
right
now
said
pinsky
per
cent
of
rats
in
l.a.
now
carry
bubonic
plague
if
that
figures
hits
per
cent
the
medieval
disease
will
start
jumping
to
humans
in
other
words
if
la
doesn't
sort
out
its
trash
problem
and
its
homeless
problem
the
return
of
bubonic
plague
is
virtually
guaranteed
