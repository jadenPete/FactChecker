haverford

defends
caring
firefighter
who
tried
to
join
far-right
proud
boys
a
day
after
haverford
township
officials
shut
down
the
bon
air
fire
company
for
not
parting
with
a
volunteer
who
had
tried
to
join
the
far-right
men's
group
the
proud
boys
the
company
issued
a
statement
thursday
defending
the
firefighter
and
its
decision
to
keep
him
bon
air
said
thursday
that
the
volunteer
who
has
been
identified
as
bruce
mcclay
jr
had
done
nothing
wrong
as
a
firefighter
and
was
exercising
his
right
to
freely
assemble
and
to
freely
associate
with
others
bon
air's
list
of
members
now
pulled
down
from
its
website
indicated
mcclay
was
a
lieutenant
and
vice
president
of
the
board
of
directors
while
the
volunteer
attended
some
social
gatherings
of
the
outside
organization
the
volunteer
ultimately
decided
after
he
learned
more
about
the
group's
beliefs
that
he
did
not
wish
to
become
part
of
the
organization
bon
air
said
in
its
statement
he
never
attended
any
rallies
or
protests
and
he
disassociated
himself
from
the
group
more
than
one
year
ago
he
has
broken
no
law
and
committed
no
crime
mcclay
the
statement
continued
has
not
made
any
statements
to
his
fellow
volunteers
or
posted
any
statements
on
social
media
in
support
of
the
views
of
the
outside
organization
or
which
reflect
poorly
on
his
ability
to
faithfully
carry
out
the
duties
of
his
position
to
haverford
community
thought
crimes
are
the
ultimate
crimes
legal
expert
robert
barnes
breaks
down
the
exact
laws
and
rights
the
red
flag
laws
would
violate
for
americans
here's
their
statement
in
full
this
all
started
because
an
antifa
activist
reported
mcclay
to
the
thought
police
for
a
thought
crime
the
controversy
surrounding
mcclay
began
in
mid-august
when
an
antifascist
activist
notified
haverford
officials
of
the
volunteer's
association
with
a
local
chapter
of
the
proud
boys
who
advocates
for
closed
borders
anti-political
correctness
and
venerating
the
housewife
in
the
past
the
group's
leadership
has
denied
valuing
white
supremacy
although
members
have
shared
white
nationalist
content
this
was
the
doxer
about
a
month
ago
i
exposed
a
proud
boy
firefighter
in
havertown
pa
the
fire
company
refused
to
remove
him
so
the
town
shut
down
the
fire
department

take
that
volunteer
firefighters
remember
president
trump
is
a
white
supremacist
according
to
all
the
leading
democrats
so
under
these
rules
everyone
who
ever
shared
any
pro-trump
content
is
also
a
white
supremacist
who
needs
to
be
shut
down
after
they
learned
of
mcclay's
involvement
with
the
proud
boys
township
officials
questioned
the
volunteer
who
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
trying
to
join
the
proud
boys
he
also
told
them
he
had
attended
several
social
events
and
passed
two
of
the
four
steps
required
for
membership
the
township
said
mcclay
attempted
to
resign
from
bon
air
but
the
company's
board
refused
to
accept
his
resignation
on
aug
bon
air's
lawyer
emailed
haverford's
solicitor
saying
the
company's
board
had
met
discussed
the
issue
and
found
no
basis
for
terminating
the
volunteer's
membership
the
township's
response
was
to
shut
down
the
company
on
wednesday
whether
you're
a
police
officer
enforcing
the
law
or
whether
you're
a
fireman
going
into
people's
homes
we
expect
a
level
of
conduct
and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
close
call
larry
holmes
vice
president
of
the
havertown
township
nine-member
board
of
commissioners
said
wednesday
we're
not
talking
about
punishing
people
for
political
beliefs
we're
talking
about
an
association
with
an
organization
demonstrating
and
responsible
for
political
violence
and
espousing
views
that
are
antithetical
to
america
it's
true
they're
not
talking
about
punishing
people
for
their
political
beliefs
they're
actively
punishing
people
for
their
political
beliefs
the
mcclays
halphen
said
have
a
tradition
of
firefighting
bruce
mcclay
jr
s
late
grandfather
sam
mcclay

a
longtime
bon

volunteer
serving
for
more
than

according
to
inquirer
archives
his
name
is
memorialized
on
a
metal
plaque
in
front
of
the
firehouse
and
a
few
years
ago
the
crew
room
was
named
after
him
it
was
unclear
thursday
whether
bon
air
would
take
any
legal
action
against
the
township
for
shutting
down
the
member
volunteer
company
the
township's
decision
to
close
the
fire
company
is
wrong
and
harmful
to
the
community
bon
air
said
in
its
statement
urging
the
town
to
reconsider
its
decision
and
for
residents
to
contact
their
commissioners
with
pleas
to
reopen
the
station
the
town
staunch
in
its
resolve
to
shut
down
bon
air
has
repossessed
the
company's
firefighting
equipment
including
its
three
fire
trucks
with
bon
air
indefinitely
out
of
service
haverford's
four
other
volunteer
fire
companies
will
handle
calls
all
the
companies
are
within
miles
of
each
other
listen
to
how
this
story
was
reported
by
america's
pravda
this
is
wild
this
fire
