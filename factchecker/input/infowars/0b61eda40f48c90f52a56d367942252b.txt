down
syndrome
drag
show
comes
to
america
british
troupe
known
as
drag
syndrome
to
perform
at
all-ages
festival
a
u.k.
drag
troupe
called
drag
syndrome
is
making
its
first
appearance
in
the
united
states
on
saturday
in
grand
rapids
michigan
the
group
was
scheduled
to
perform
at
an
all-age
public
art
festival
called
project
but
the
production
was
nearly
canceled
following
pushback
from
republican
congressional
candidate
peter
meijer
the
performance
was
set
to
take
place
at
tanglefoot
studios
an
outdoor
amphitheater
but
according
to
out
com
tanglefoot
owner
peter
meijer
took
issue
with
the
event
meijer
the
grandson
of
retail
chain
magnate
frederik
meijer
and
a
republican
candidate
for
congress
claimed
in
a
letter
to
festival
organizers
that
people
with
down
syndrome
must
be
protected
from
exploitation
meijer
said
the
differently-abled
are
among
the
most
special
souls
in
our
community
and
that
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
give
their
full
and
informed
consent
the
michigan-based
advocacy
group
behind
the
event
disart
reached
out
to
meijer
and
discussions
took
place
but
ultimately
meijer
decided
not
to
allow
the
troupe
to
perform
at
the
amphitheater
with
less
than
two
weeks
to
go
before
the
event
disart
claimed
meijer
was
discriminating
against
the
group
and
even
teamed
up
with
the
aclu
to
file
a
formal
complaint
the
congressional
candidate
defended
his
decision
on
twitter
writing
the
notion
that
i
am
discriminating
against
the
disabled
is
profoundly
offensive
statement
from
votemeijer
who
is
defending
his
decision
to
not
allow
drag
syndrome
to
perform
in
his
building

researching
drag
he
