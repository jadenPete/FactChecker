greenspan
rising
gold
price
shows
investors
want
hard
assets
that
will
increase
in
value
former
federal
reserve
chairman
says
aging
population
plans
to
live
longer
than
originally
expected
during
a
cnbc
interview
former
federal
reserve
chairman
alan
greenspan
said
gold
prices
are
surging
because
investors
are
looking
for
hard
assets
that
they
know
will
have
value
in
or
years
gold
is
up
more
than
on
the
year
and
is
trading
at
levels
not
seen
since
during
the
interview
greenspan
focused
on
an
interesting
fundamental
he
thinks
is
driving
both
the
bond
and
gold
markets
the
aging
population
he
said
there
has
been
a
shift
in
time
preferences
as
people
recognize
they
will
likely
live
longer
and
they
will
need
to
finance
those
longer
lives
this
he
says
is
increasing
the
demand
for
hard
assets
like
gold
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
gold
price
is
rising
as
fast
as
it
is
that's
telling
us
essentially
that
people
are
hard
resources
which
they
know
are
going
to
have
a
value
years
from
now
or
years
from
now
as
they
age
and
they
want
to
make
sure
they
have
the
resources
to
keep
themselves
in
place
that
is
a
clearly
fundamental
force
that
is
driving
this
when
gold
goes
higher
markets
go
lower
the
price
of
gold
is
an
accurate
indicator
about
the
state
of
the
global
economy
historically
gold
has
served
as
an
inflation
hedge
and
a
wealth
preserver
it
makes
sense
that
investors
concerned
about
maintaining
their
savings
well
into
the
future
would
turn
to
gold
this
is
especially
true
given
the
likelihood
of
increasing
inflation
as
the
federal
reserve
continues
to
try
to
prop
up
the
economy
with
low
interest
rates
and
quantitative
easing
peter
schiff
has
said
that
eventually
the
world
will
drown
in
an
ocean
of
inflation
every
central
bank
has
bought
into
this
nonsense
that
we
must
have
inflation
and
that
interest
rates
need
to
be
negative
inflation
needs
to
be
high
enough
to
have
real
negative
rates
all
over
the
globe
that's
where
we
are
heading
so
if
that
is
the
case
people
have
no
place
to
hide
except
gold
and
that
is
why
they're
buying
greenspan
also
talked
about
negative
interest
rates
he
said
the
aging
population
is
also
one
underlying
factor
in
falling
bond
yields
an
aging
population
is
driving
demand
for
bonds
pushing
up
the
price
and
driving
down
yield
he
says
he
eventually
expects
to
see
negative
yields
in
the
us
you're
seeing
it
pretty
much
throughout
the
world
it's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it's
more
in
the
united
states
there
is
now
more
than
trillion
in
negative-yielding
debt
globally
greenspan
said
when
there
is
a
significant
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
population
the
look
for
coupon
as
a
result
of
that
there's
a
tendency
to
disregard
the
fact
that
that
has
an
effect
in
the
net
interest
rate
that
they
receive
as
far
as
the
economy
goes
greenspan
said
it
seems
to
be
sagging
former
reagan
omb
director
david
stockman
had
another
take
on
falling
bond
yields
saying
recently
that
the
bond
market
is
in
the
mother
of
all
bubbles
what
we're
seeing
is
rampant
speculation
in
the
bond
market
investors
are
banking
on
continued
bond-buying
by
central
banks
they
believe
this
will
continue
to
push
prices
up
and
they're
speculating
on
the
rising
prices
it's
nothing
but
a
massive
bond
market
bubble
gold
going
up
interest
rates
going
down
gerald

a
few
predictions
for
upcoming
financial
trends
worldwide
