brexit
party
leader
nigel
farage
has
said
that
he
is
per
cent
sincere
about
a
non-aggression
pact
with
the
conservatives
and
has
pledged
to
not
stand
candidates
against
the
tory
spartans
in
the
european
research
group
erg
who
opposed
theresa
may's
soft-brexit
deal
we
are
not
playing
political
games
mr
farage
wrote
in
the
telegraph
on
sunday
adding
that
he
welcomed
comments
by
chairman
of
the
erg
steve
baker
who
earlier
this
week
called
for
an
election
pact
between
the
tories
and
the
brexit
party
in
the
event
of
an
election
to
stop
the
remain
coalition
baker
knows
it
is
blindingly
obvious
that
the
tories
simply
cannot
secure
seats
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
that
voted
leave
but
that
the
brexit
party
would
win
there
mr
farage
said
alluding
to
labour
leaver
constituencies
in
the
north
and
midlands
of
england
and
in
wales
with
the
politician
having
declared
war
on
the
labour
party
for
abandoning
its
working
class
brexiter
voters
to
become
the
party
of
remain
and
the
party
of
the
london
liberal
elite
mr
farage
has
called
on
prime
minster
boris
johnson
to
agree
to
such
a
tactical
pact
where
each
would
stand
down
candidates
if
it
benefited
the
other
but
said
that
he
would
only
do
so
if
johnson
abandoned
renegotiations
of
may's
withdrawal
treaty
and
fully
embraced
a
no
deal
brexit
otherwise
he
would
stand
candidates
in
all
seats
across
the
country
