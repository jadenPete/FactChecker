presidential

joe
biden's
brain
may
negatively
impact
his
campaign
like
former
presidential

hillary

emails
did
a
left-wing
correspondent
said
the
week's
national
correspondent
ryan
cooper
wrote
a
monday
op-ed
titled
this
is
joe
biden's
emails
problem
in
which
the
correspondent
explained
his
theory
that
biden's
possibly-failing
brain
will
be
the
hillary
clinton
emails
story
of
all
over
again
cooper
referenced
biden's
recent
gaffe
where
the
former
democratic
vice
president
told
an
emotional
war
story
that
was
actually
a
compilation
of
three
different
events
this
is
the
god's
truth
year-old
biden
told
people
assembled
in
a
hanover
new
hampshire
college
meeting
hall
in
august
my
word
as
a
biden
cooper
said
the
facts
of
the
war
story
are
in
one
important
sense
beside
the
point
they
raise
a
question
cooper
wrote
is
joe
biden
mentally
unsound
raping
of
the
west's
economy
dr
nick
begich
breaks
down
the
booming
middle
class
in
asia
and
exposes
how
the
west's
economy
has
been
systematically
transferred
eastward
to
allow
for
this
financial
boom
especially
in
china
the
national
correspondent
said
biden
has
lost
a
step
or
three
throughout
his
political
career
and
pointed
out
there
is
already
a
narrative
that
biden's
mind
may
be
failing
him
cooper
compared
biden's
repartee
with
former
gop
vice
presidential
candidate
paul
ryan
in
to
biden
stammering
about
how
he
disagrees
with
democratic
presidential
candidate
bernie
sanders
a
vermont
senator
on
health
care
in
late
august
he
easily
put
away
paul
ryan
in
the
vice
presidential
debate
cooper
wrote
cooper
draws
on
splinter's
hamilton
nolan's
thoughts
on
biden
after
nolan
attended
several
biden
events
it
is
impossible
not
to
notice
that
joe
is
getting
old
nolan
wrote
in
august
any
reporter
who
doesn't
note
this
is
not
telling
you
the
whole
truth
about
what
they
witness
biden
is
not
senile
or
unable
to
function
but
the
signs
of
the
slow
creep
of
cognitive
decline
are
too
visible
to
ignore
cooper
warned
biden's
gaffes
will
be
a
major
focus
if
the
former
vice
president
is
the
nominee
and
that
biden
s
policy
will
be
lost
and
ignored
while
the
media
focuses
on
his
mistakes
i
know
this
because
it's
exactly
what
happened
to
hillary
clinton
with
her
emails
a
damaging
story
that
kept
getting
dribbled
out
for
months
and
months
with
every
fresh
droplet
of
news
getting
saturation
coverage
cooper
wrote
it
was
probably
the
most-covered
single
story
of
the
entire
campaign
and
did
tremendous
damage
to
clinton's
campaign
he
added
