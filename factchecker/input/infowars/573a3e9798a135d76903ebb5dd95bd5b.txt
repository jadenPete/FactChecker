figure
democratic
presidential
candidate
senator
elizabeth
warren
is
reportedly
in
talks
with
failed
presidential
nominee
hillary
clinton
a
move
that's
at
odds
with
warren's
progressive
image
and
people
really
aren't
happy
about
it
the
two
have
been
in
communication
since
the
massachusetts
senator
announced
her
presidential
run
although
both
are
keeping
quiet
about
it
nbc
reports
citing
several
people
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
it
isn't
clear
how
often
the
two
women
speak
or
what
they
discuss
but
a
source
close
to
the
former
secretary
of
state
said
their
contact
has
been
recent
and
has
clearly
not
gone
unnoticed
warren's
team
reportedly
don't
want
to
speak
about
clinton
likely
because
of
her
loss
to
donald
trump
in
and
her
unpopularity
with
progressive
democrats
as
well
as
with
vermont
senator
bernie
sanders
supporters
the
news
that
warren
is
in
talks
with
clinton
has
sparked
anger
on
social
media
with
some
calling
her
a
centrist
opportunist
and
saying
she
is
not
an
ally
to
bernie
but
to
the
establishment
others
mocked
her
for
taking
advice
from
the
woman
who
lost
to
trump
while
one
even
predicted
warren
would
pick
clinton
to
be
her
vice-president
although
centrist
clinton
is
problematic
within
progressive
circles
of
the
democratic
party
she
holds
sway
within
its
establishment
and
would
absolutely
have
influence
over
a
number
of
delegates
to
the
democratic
party
convention
said
deb
kozikowski
the
vice
chair
of
the
massachusetts
democratic
party
bernie
sanders
recently
called
for
a
global
eugenics
program
paid
for
by
american
taxpayers
