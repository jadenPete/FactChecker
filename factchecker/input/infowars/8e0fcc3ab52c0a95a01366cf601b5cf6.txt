red
flag
gun
laws
are
rooted
in
communist
methods
of
oppression
once
pandora's
box
of
pre-crime
hearsay
evidence
is
opened
the
sky
is
the
limit
for
the
violation
of
american
constitutional
rights
this
week
government
officials
are
set
to
come
back
from
their
summer
recess
and
i
have
heard
from
a
couple
different
sources
that
the
us
senate
in
particular
is
seeking
to
fast
track
legislation
on
red
flag
gun
laws
as
well
as
a
possible
ban
on
private
party
transfers
of
firearms
and
a
possible
ban
on
high
capacity
magazines
i
can
only
hope
that
these
are
just
rumors
but
i
suspect
they
are
accurate
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
has
publicly
vowed
to
pursue
any
new
gun
control
legislation
that
the
trump
administration
supports
and
donald
trump
has
openly
called
for
red
flag
gun
laws
involving
mental
health
guidelines
the
mainstream
media
now
claims
that
a
majority
of
americans
on
both
sides
of
the
political
divide
support
red
flag
legislation
but
we
all
know
how
rigged
such
polls
can
be
the
real
question
is
does
the
average
american
even
know
what
red
flag
laws
would
entail
i
think
they
do
not
red
flag
gun
laws
are
a
method
of
gun
control
by
which
a
family
member
or
law
enforcement
can
petition
the
court
to
confiscate
a
person's
firearms
on
the
suspicion
that
the
person
may
present
a
danger
to
themselves
or
others
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
stop
there
some
reports
indicate
that
trump
is
seriously
considering
using
big
tech
companies
like
amazon
and
apple
to
monitor
people's
behavior
and
link
this
data
to
a
social
credit
system
similar
to
the
system
that
already
exists
in
china
your
gun
rights
could
then
be
determined
by
algorithms
that
mark
you
as
a
potential
risk
simply
by
what
you
post
online
prosecution
using
the
public
to
spy
on
itself
is
a
hallmark
of
these
kinds
of
laws
it
is
also
nothing
new
the
puritans
in
early
america
used
intangible
evidence
such
as
spectral
evidence
to
punish
people
of
various
crimes
including
witchcraft
this
encouraged
extreme
collectivism
and
conformity
for
anyone
stepping
outside
the
lines
of
what
the
group
saw
as
righteous
behavior
could
find
themselves
secretly
accused
using
rhetorical
evidence
and
unable
to
defend
themselves
their
only
option
was
to
admit
to
the
crime
whether
they
were
guilty
or
not
and
then
repent
but
in
a
social
or
political
witch
hunt
you
are
not
repenting
to
get
in
god's
good
graces
but
to
get
in
the
good
graces
of
the
collective
you
are
supposed
to
sublimate
yourself
for
the
group
and
beg
their
forgiveness
not
for
the
crime
you
are
accused
but
for
the
crime
of
acting
as
an
individual
the
message
is
clear
there
is
no
way
to
fight
back
just
give
in
and
if
you
are
lucky
the
collective
will
let
you
continue
living
under
their
watchful
eye
of
course
this
might
sound
like
something
that
could
never
happen
in
the
us
today
but
it
already
has
the
existence
of
the
no
fly
list
which
is
generated
in
secret
is
often
politically
motivated
and
is
based
on
evidence
that
the
accused
is
never
allowed
to
see
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
law
that
is
similar
to
red
flag
legislation
while
the
no
fly
list
has
been
confronted
in
court
numerous
times
it
still
endures
and
is
little
changed
since
its
inception
once
ingrained
these
laws
are
rarely
ever
removed
red
flag
laws
were
created
to
keep
the
public
safe
from
possible
violent
criminals
matt
bracken
explains
these
laws
can
be
abused
and
lead
to
a
future
that
no
one
in
america
should
desire
it
is
likely
that
red
flag
gun
laws
will
operate
in
the
same
way
one
day
you
may
walk
into
the
sporting
goods
store
and
be
denied
a
gun
purchase
by
the
atf
there
will
be
no
explanation
only
the
denial
of
your
rights
accusations
can
come
from
anywhere
even
complete
strangers
using
anonymous
online
applications
this
is
how
the
chinese
social
credit
system
works
they
could
be
based
on
legitimate
behavior
such
as
suicide
or
murder
threats
or
they
could
be
based
on
a
political
statement
you
wrote
or
said
years
ago
it
doesn't
matter
the
goal
will
be
to
take
gun
rights
away
from
as
many
people
as
possible
while
the
government
still
claims
to
support
the
ndamendment
it's
about
the
back
door
destruction
of
gun
rights
not
public
safety
it's
also
about
silencing
public
dissent
the
bottom
line
is
if
you
allow
pre-crime
judgment
based
on
hearsay
evidence
for
one
person
then
you
are
allowing
it
for
all
people
including
yourself
and
it
might
not
stop
with
whether
or
not
a
person
is
allowed
to
buy
or
own
a
gun
these
systems
of
control
expand
into
every
facet
of
life
again
simply
look
at
what
is
happening
in
china
the
method
of
using
mental
health
or
social
disruption
as
an
excuse
to
silence
dissent
was
not
actually
mastered
by
china
however
it
was
standardized
in
communist
russia
during
the
reign
of
the
soviets
the
mental
health
excuse
was
exploited
on
a
regular
basis
in
order
to
quietly
sweep
government
critics
and
dissidents
under
the
rug
never
to
be
seen
again
the
metal
hospitals
where
these
deplorables
were
kept
were
called
psikhushka
an
ironic
diminutive
label
the
hospitals
worked
hand
in
hand
with
the
cheka
secret
police
and
their
vast
networks
of
civilian
informants
see
something
say
something
began
under
communists
in
the
east
it's
only
being
recycled
today
in
the
west
for
the
soviets
the
methodology
made
sense
the
message
they
were
sending
was
that
anyone
who
criticized
socialism
communism
must
be
crazy
and
in
a
way
this
is
how
red
flag
laws
function
for
if
you
are
put
on
the
list
or
denied
gun
rights
then
there
must
be
something
mentally
wrong
with
you
and
by
extension
if
you
are
placed
on
the
list
for
political
reasons
then
your
political
beliefs
or
convictions
must
also
be
psychologically
disturbed
you
see
how
this
works
red
flag
laws
and
social
credit
systems
take
the
psikhushka
and
flip
it
around
they
don't
need
mental
health
prisons
they
simply
turn
the
whole
country
into
a
mental
health
prison
the
wardens
and
guards
of
this
prison
will
be
the
citizenry
and
they
will
police
each
other
make
no
mistake
the
mainstream
media
and
the
government
have
been
conditioning
the
public
for
years
to
the
concept
that
certain
ideals
and
political
activists
are
on
the
fringe
they
are
conspiracy
theorists
they
are
exhibiting
defiance
disorders
they
are
not
right
in
the
head
red
flag
gun
laws
are
meant
for
people
like
me
or
perhaps
people
like
you
precursor
testing
of
denial
of
gun
rights
based
on
mental
health
accusations
has
already
taken
place
against
war
veterans
in
the
us
based
on
ptsd
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
it
makes
sense
that
the
government
would
seek
to
disarm
trained
combat
experienced
veterans
first
as
they
tend
to
present
the
biggest
source
of
resistance
to
a
totalitarian
shift
legal
expert
robert
barnes
breaks
down
the
exact
laws
and
rights
the
red
flag
laws
would
violate
for
americans
i
can't
say
that
trump's
open
support
of
red
flag
laws
surprises
me
in
the
slightest
trump's
long
term
business
relationships
and
debts
to
the
rothschild
banking
elites
as
well
as
his
many
dubious
cabinet
choices
including
pompeo
ross
mnuchin
kudlow
lightheizer
etc
indicate
to
me
that
trump
is
not
on
the
side
of
liberty
activists
john
bolton's
recent
exit
from
the
white
house
does
not
impress
me
it
is
clearly
a
crumb
thrown
to
conservatives
as
a
means
to
keep
them
close
to
the
neo-con
table
the
goal
of
the
elites
to
lure
conservatives
into
blind
adulation
of
the
trump
admin
is
starting
to
fail
and
they
had
to
do
something
also
it
is
not
uncommon
for
elitist
members
to
jump
ship
from
an
administration
right
before
their
agenda's
are
implemented
so
that
they
get
none
of
the
blame
for
the
consequences
bolton
should
never
have
been
in
trump's
cabinet
to
begin
with
he
was
there
for
years
and
just
because
bolton
is
leaving
doesn't
mean
his
agendas
will
be
leaving
trump
has
many
elitist
handlers
and
i'm
sure
bolton
will
be
replaced
with
yet
another
reprehensible
ghoul
in
due
course
in
my
recent
article
the
real
reasons
why
the
media
is
suddenly
admitting
to
the
recession
threat
i
noted
that
if
an
economic
crisis
strikes
in
the
next
year
then
it's
highly
unlikely
that
trump
is
slated
to
be
president
after
the
elections
if
he
supports
red
flag
laws
then
it
is
almost
assured
that
he
will
not
be
president
for
another
term
in
our
controlled
political
machine
in
which
presidents
from
both
parties
are
merely
puppets
for
elitist
interests
these
kinds
of
liberty
crushing
laws
are
not
generally
designed
for
the
current
administration's
use
rather
they
are
supported
by
one
president
or
party
and
then
exploited
by
the
next
president
or
party
in
power
in
this
way
conservatives
could
be
tricked
into
backing
unconstitutional
laws
in
the
name
of
helping
their
side
win
only
to
discover
that
the
laws
they
supported
or
ignored
are
being
used
against
them
by
democrats
a
few
years
later
i
think
this
would
be
especially
true
for
red
flag
legislation
if
conservatives
do
not
raise
hell
in
response
to
these
laws
just
because
they
don't
want
to
derail
the
trump
train
then
they
will
find
themselves
complicit
in
their
own
disarmament
if
markets
tank
and
the
dems
take
over
in
the
socialist
front
runners
will
say
that
we
asked
for
this
under
trump
and
now
we're
getting
what
we
wanted
and
once
these
laws
are
in
the
books
expect
that
a
majority
of
police
will
comply
with
them
and
enforce
them
of
course
this
leads
to
an
inevitable
outcome
war
there
are
millions
of
people
in
the
us
that
are
not
going
to
fold
to
the
dismantling
of
gun
rights
or
gun
confiscation
no
doubt
we
would
all
be
labeled
terrorists
and
our
defiance
would
be
held
up
as
further
proof
of
our
mental
instability
so
be
it
once
the
pandora's
box
of
pre-crime
and
hearsay
evidence
is
opened
the
sky
is
truly
the
limit
for
the
violation
of
american
constitutional
rights
for
whatever
it's
worth
now
would
be
a
good
time
for
gun
rights
advocates
to
contact
their
representatives
and
warn
them
that
red
flag
laws
are
unacceptable
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
government
may
push
a
long
list
of
new
gun
control
restrictions
on
top
of
red
flag
laws
as
a
means
to
frighten
the
public
they
will
then
rescind
many
of
the
items
on
the
list
except
the
red
flag
legislation
in
order
to
make
it
appear
as
thought
we
got
lucky
the
real
goal
here
is
the
mental
health
restrictions
and
the
ability
for
government
to
deny
your
rights
according
to
hearsay
evidence
gun
ownership
is
as
integral
to
a
free
society
as
free
speech
and
property
rights
without
firearms
ownership
the
public
is
at
the
mercy
of
any
criminal
or
criminal
government
that
seeks
to
oppress
them
remember
if
your
military
style
rifle
was
not
a
threat
to
the
elites
then
they
would
not
constantly
seek
to
take
it
away
never
let
it
go
