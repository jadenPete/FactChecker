president
trump
fires
john
bolton
as
national
security
advisor
neocon
warhawk
has
been
at
odds
with
president's
diplomatic
approach
from
the
start
president
trump
has
announced
tuesday
that
he's
asked
for
john
bolton
to
resign
as
national
security
advisor
i
informed
john
bolton
last
night
that
his
services
are
no
longer
needed
at
the
white
house
i
disagreed
strongly
with
many
of
his
suggestions
as
did
others
in
the
administration
and
therefore
i
asked
john
for
his
resignation
which
was
given
to
me
this
morning
trump
tweeted
i
thank
john
very
much
for
his
service
i
will
be
naming
a
new
national
security
advisor
next
week
trump's
relationship
with
bolton
has
reportedly
soured
over
the
last
several
months
over
trump's
diplomatic
approach
to
north
korea
iran
and
afghanistan
the
president
criticized
bolton
over
his
neocon
war
hawk
stances
citing
his
support
of
the
unnecessary
iraq
war
i
have
two
groups
of
people
i
have
doves
and
i
have
hawks
john
bolton
is
absolutely
a
hawk
if
it
was
up
to
him
he'd
take
on
the
whole
world
at
one
time
okay
trump
told
reporters
in
june
around
that
same
time
trump
introduced
dovish
senator
rand
paul
r-ky
as
a
de
facto
advisor
on
middle
east
policy
matters
while
relegating
bolton
to
the
less
important
matters
like
consulting
mongolia
on
security
issues
while
trump
made
history
crossing
into
north
korea
