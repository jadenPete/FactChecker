university
researchers
have
found
the
companionship
of
a
pet
after
the
loss
of
a
spouse
can
help
reduce
feelings
of
depression
and
loneliness
in
older
adults
the
study
funded
by
the
gerontological
society
of
america
and
the
waltham
centre
for

nutrition
and
published

examined
depressive
symptoms
and
loneliness
among
people
age
and
older
who
experienced
the
loss
of
a
spouse
through
death
or
divorce
increasingly
there's
evidence
that
our
social
support
networks
are
really
beneficial
for
maintaining
our
mental
health
following
stressful
events
despite
the
devastation
we
experience
in
later
life
when
we
experience

was
interested
in
understanding
alternatives
to

the
psychological
consequences
of

carr
and
her
team
compared
individuals
who
experienced
the
loss
of
a
spouse
to
those
who
stayed
continuously
married
then
they
explored
whether
the
effects
of
spousal
loss
differed
for
those
who
had
a
pet
at
the
time
of
the

the

showcases
a

of
actual
practices
of
those
who
want
to
consume
the
essence
of
innocence
they
found
all
individuals
who
lost
their
spouse
experienced
higher
levels
of
depression
however
people
without
a
pet
experienced
more
significant
increases
in
depressive
symptoms
and
higher
loneliness
than
those
who
had
pets
in
fact
those
who
had
a
pet
and
experienced
the
death
or
divorce
of
their
spouse
were
no
lonelier
than
older
adults
who
didn't
experience
one
of
those
events
that's
an
important
and
impressive
finding
carr
said
experiencing
some
depression
after
a
loss
is
normal
but
we
usually
are
able
to
adjust
over
time
to
these
losses
persistent
loneliness
on
the
other
hand
is
associated
with
greater
incidents
of
mortality
and
faster
onset
of
disability
which
means
it's
especially
bad
for
your
health
our
findings
suggest
that
pets
could
help
individuals
avoid
the
negative
consequences
of
loneliness
after
a
loss
carr's
team
used
data
from
a
sample
of
older
adults
who
participated
in
an
experimental
survey
about
human-animal
interaction
as
part
of
the
university
of
michigan's
health
and
retirement
study
in
and
linked
the
data
with
additional
data
collected
between
and
they
identified
pet
owners
as
those
participants
who
either
had
a
cat
or
a
dog
in
everyday
life
having
a
cat
or
dog
may
not
make
you
healthier
carr
said
but
when
facing
a
stressful
event
we
might
lean
on
a
pet
for
support
you
can
talk
to
your
dog
they're
not
going
to
tell
you
you're
a
bad
person
they're
just
going
to
love
you
or
you
can
pet
your
cat
and
it's
calming
the
researchers
noted
that
additional
studies
should
be
conducted
to
explain
why
having
pets
helps
maintain
mental
health
better
however
carr
suggested
part
of
it
may
relate
to
whether
you
feel
like
you
matter
to
someone
oftentimes
the
relationship
we
have
with
our
spouse
is
our
most
intimate
where
our
sense
of
self
is
really
embedded
in
that
relationship
carr
said
so
losing
that
sense
of
purpose
and
meaning
in
our
lives
that
comes
from
that
relationship
can
be
really
devastating
a
pet
might
help
offset
some
of
those
feelings
it
makes
sense
to
think
well
at
least
this
pet
still
needs
me
i
can
take
care
of
it
i
can
love
it
and
it
appreciates
me
that
ability
to
give
back
and
give
love
is
really
pretty
powerful
the
findings
have
potential
consequences
for
social
policies
for
instance
it
may
be
beneficial
to
include
companion
animals
in
the
treatment
of
people
residing
in
senior-living
facilities
or
reducing
barriers
to
pet
ownership
