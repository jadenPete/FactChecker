this
is
what
social
media
is
doing
to
us
the
big
social
media
companies
are
going
to
just
keep
coming
up
with
more
ways
to
make
their
products
addicting
scientific
study
after
scientific
study
is
showing
that
too
much
time
on
social
media
can
be
extremely
harmful
both
mentally
and
physically
but
even
though
most
of
us
know
this
very
few
of
us
actually
alter
our
behavior
in
a
meaningful
way
when
facebook
twitter
youtube
instagram
and
other
major
social
media
platforms
first
emerged
we
welcomed
them
with
open
arms
they
were
a
lot
of
fun
and
they
allowed
us
to
interact
with
family
friends
and
society
as
a
whole
in
ways
that
we
had
never
been
able
to
do
before
but
they
were
also
extremely
addictive
and
they
rapidly
became
transformed
into
dumping
grounds
for
just
about
everything
toxic
negative
and
malevolent
that
you
can
possibly
imagine
today
many
of
us
spend
far
more
time
on
social
media
than
we
do
with
real
people
and
as
you
will
see
below
that
has
enormous
implications
for
our
future
a
growing
body
of
scientific
research
clearly
indicates
that
spending
too
much
time
on
social
media
can
be
very
bad
for
us
for
example
just
consider
what
a
long-term
study
that
was
conducted
by
gallup
over
a
period
of
two
years
ultimately
concluded
holly
shakya
assistant
professor
at
uc
san
diego
and
yale
professor
nicholas
christakis
spent
two
years
following
adults
who
are
part
of
a
gallup
long-term
study
after
asking
permission
they
monitored
these
subjects
facebook
use
directly
from
facebook
rather
than
asking
subjects
to
report
their
own
use
people
often
don't
realize
how
much
time
they
spend
on
the
social
network
and
they
checked
in
with
subjects
on
their
emotional
and
physical
well-being
as
well
as
their
body-mass
index
bmi
three
times
over
the
course
of
two
years
overall
our
results
showed
that
while
real-world
social
networks
were
positively
associated
with
overall
well-being
the
use
of
facebook
was
negatively
associated
with
overall
well-being
the
researchers
wrote
in
a
harvard
business
review
article
these
results
were
particularly
strong
for
mental
health
most
measures
of
facebook
use
in
one
year
predicted
a
decrease
in
mental
health
in
a
later
year
that
doesn't
sound
good
at
all
if
you
knew
that
something
was
going
to
consistently
degrade
both
your
mental
and
physical
well-being
would
you
engage
in
that
activity
every
single
day
and
yet
most
of
us
simply
cannot
go
hours
without
checking
our
social
media
accounts
establishment
democrats
and
republicans
have
joined
forces
to
steal
the
election
and
crush
the
nationalist
populist
uprising
the
fec
is
joining
with
establishment
politicians
to
control
information
on
the
internet
all
while
claiming
they're
saving
it
look
through
their
words
and
right
into
their
actions
to
see
what's
really
going
on
one
way
that
social
media
is
affecting
our
mental
health
is
that
it
is
making
all
of
us
a
whole
lot
more
impatient
just
check
out
what
a
survey
of
british
adults
found
patience
is
a
virtue
but
it's
becoming
an
exceedingly
rare
quality
in
modern
society
according
to
a
new
survey
of
british
adults
all
of
the
luxuries
of
modern
life
have
made
most
people
incredibly
impatient
across
pretty
much
every
aspect
of
their
lives
three
quarters
of
those
surveyed
said
they
believe
the
dominance
of
digital
technology
such
as
smartphones
and
on-demand
tvs
are
to
blame
for
this
ever
growing
lack
of
patience
respondents
reported
becoming
frustrated
after
just
seconds
of
waiting
for
a
web
page
to
load
and
after
seconds
of
waiting
for
a
traffic
light
to
change
when
i
read
those
paragraphs
i
found
myself
nodding
my
head
in
agreement
these
days
i
have
a
hard
time
waiting
for
anything
and
i
always
feel
like
i
am
in
a
hurry
can
you
identify
with
that
i
have
a
feeling
that
many
of
you
can
another
study
that
focused
on
teens
found
that
emotional
investment
in
social
media
was
strongly
correlated
with
higher
levels
of
anxiety
a
study
of
more
than
youth
aged
to
found
that
percent
of
participants
indicated
that
they
used
social
media
thirty-five
percent
of
participants
were
categorized
as
poor
sleepers
forty-seven
percent
of
participants
were
identified
as
anxious
also
and
here's
the
kicker
higher
emotional
investment
in
social
media
was
strongly
correlated
with
higher
levels
of
anxiety
do
we
really
want
our
young
people
to
be
bundles
of
nerves
anxiety
continues
to
be
a
growing
problem
in
our
society
and
it
appears
that
social
media
is
playing
a
major
role
in
addition
yet
another
study
that
was
conducted
not
too
long
ago
discovered
a
direct
link
between
social
media
use
and
increased
levels
of
depression
and
loneliness
a
new
study
concludes
that
there
is
in
fact
a
causal
link
between
the
use
of
social
media
and
negative
effects
on
well-being
primarily
depression
and
loneliness
the
study
was
published
in
the
journal
of
social
and
clinical
psychology
what
we
found
overall
is
that
if
you
use
less
social
media
you
are
actually
less
depressed
and
less
lonely
meaning
that
the
decreased
social
media
use
is
what
causes
that
qualitative
shift
in
your
well-being
said
jordyn
young
a
co-author
of
the
paper
and
a
senior
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
today
americans
take
more
anti-depressants
than
anyone
else
on
the
entire
planet
deaths
of
despair
have
hit
an
all-time
record
high
in
our
nation
and
all
around
us
people
seem
so
incredibly
unhappy
one
of
the
biggest
reasons
for
all
of
this
unhappiness
is
the
fact
that
we
are
all
so
isolated
according
to
a
recent
yougov
poll
over
of
american
millennials
say
that
they
don't
have
a
single
friend
more
than
of
millennials
surveyed
in
a
yougov
poll
released
this
week
claimed
that
they
don't
have
a
single
friend
and
less
than
a
third
of
millennials
said
they
have
double-digit
friends
according
to
the
data
culled
online
in
early
july
even
if
younger
americans
are
overstating
their
isolation
the
jarring
numbers
reflect
long-term
rising
trends
in
loneliness
studies
have
indicated
that
loneliness
has
myriad
negative
mental
and
physical
health
effects
of
course
if
we
all
weren't
staring
at
screens
all
day
long
we
would
have
much
more
time
to
make
real
friends
in
the
real
world
but
instead
we
find
much
more
value
in
the
online
world
that
we
have
created
and
at
this
point
the
average
adult
in
the
u.s.
spends
six
hours
and
minutes
a
day
staring
at
a
screen
perhaps
it's
no
surprise
then
that
americans
spend
nearly
half
of
their
waking
hours
looking
at
screens
according
to
a
survey
of
adults
more
specifically
the
survey
found
that
of
the
time
americans
are
awake
their
eyes
are
fixated
on
a
television
smartphone
computer
tablet
or
other
device
supposing
the
average
american
slept
eight
hours
a
night
not
even
close
to
the
case
for
most
adults
the
researchers
calculated
that
people
spend
about
six
hours
and
minutes
a
day
staring
at
a
screen
over
a
typical
lifespan
that's
days
another
survey
discovered
that
percent
of
teens
say
that
they
are
online
almost
constantly
we
have
decided
that
it
is
the
online
world
that
really
matters
but
that
is
not
true
at
all
life
is
supposed
to
be
an
adventure
but
we
will
never
live
life
to
the
fullest
if
we
are
all
staring
at
screens
endlessly
day
after
day
sadly
the
truth
is
that
social
media
is
not
going
anywhere
the
big
social
media
companies
are
going
to
just
keep
coming
up
with
more
ways
to
make
their
products
addicting
and
most
of
us
will
be
sucked
into
the
vortex
without
any
resistance
whatsoever
but
hopefully
the
awakening
regarding
the
harmful
effects
of
social
media
will
continue
to
grow
and
hopefully
more
americans
will
start
choosing
to
make
healthier
choices
regarding
how
they
use
their
time
