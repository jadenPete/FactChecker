dating
especially
during
the
teenage
years
is
thought
to
be
an
important
way
for
young
people
to
build
self-identity
develop
social
skills
learn
about
other
people
and
grow
emotionally
yet
new
research
from
the
university
of
georgia
has
found
that
not
dating
can
be
an
equally
beneficial
choice
for
teens
and
in
some
ways
these
teens
fared
even
better
the
study
published
online
in
the
journal
of
school
health
found
that
adolescents
who
were
not
in
romantic
relationships
during
middle
and
high
school
had
good
social
skills
and
low
depression
and
fared
better
or
equal
to
peers
who
dated
the
majority
of
teens
have
had
some
type
of
romantic
experience
by
to
years
of
age
or
middle
adolescence

douglas
a
doctoral
student
in

promotion
at
uga's
college
of

health
and
the
study's
lead
author
this
high
frequency
has
led
some
researchers
to
suggest
that
dating
during
teenage
years
is
a
normative
behavior
that
is
adolescents
who
have
a
romantic
relationship
are
therefore
considered
on
time
in
their
psychological
development

a

working

found
a
causal
link
between
vaccines
and
autism
but
federal
lawmakers
influenced
by
the
powerful

helped
bury
that
info
if
dating
was
considered
normal
and
essential
for

teen's
individual
development
and
well-being
douglas
began
to
wonder
what
this
suggested
about
adolescents
who
chose
not
to
date
does
this
mean
that
teens
that
don't
date
are
maladjusted
in
some
way
that
they
are
social
misfits
few
studies
had
examined
the
characteristics
of
youth
who
do
not
date
during
the
teenage
years
and
we
decided
we
wanted
to
learn
more
she
said
to
do
this
douglas
and
study
co-author
pamela
orpinas
examined
whether
th
grade
students
who
reported
no
or
very
infrequent
dating
over
a
seven-year
period
differed
on
emotional
and
social
skills
from
their
more
frequently
dating
peers
they
analyzed
data
collected
during
a
study
led
by
orpinas
which
followed
a
cohort
of
adolescents
from
northeast
georgia
from
sixth
through
th
grade
each
spring
students
indicated
whether
they
had
dated
and
reported
on
a
number
of
social
and
emotional
factors
including
positive
relationships
with
friends
at
home
and
at
school
symptoms
of
depression
and
suicidal
thoughts
their
teachers
completed
questionnaires
rating
each
student's
behavior
in
areas
that
included
social
skills
leadership
skills
and
levels
of
depression
non-dating
students
had
similar
or
better
interpersonal
skills
than
their
more
frequently
dating
peers
while
the
scores
of
self-reported
positive
relationships
with
friends
at
home
and
at
school
did
not
differ
between
dating
and
non-dating
peers
teachers
rated
the
non-dating
students
significantly
higher
for
social
skills
and
leadership
skills
than
their
dating
peers
students
who
didn't
date
were
also
less
likely
to
be
depressed
teachers
scores
on
the
depression
scale
were
significantly
lower
for
the
group
that
reported
no
dating
additionally
the
proportion
of
students
who
self-reported
being
sad
or
hopeless
was
significantly
lower
within
this
group
as
well
in
summary
we
found
that
non-dating
students
are
doing
well
and
are
simply
following
a
different
and
healthy
developmental
trajectory
than
their
dating
peers
said
orpinas
a
professor
of
health
promotion
and
behavior
while
the
study
refutes
the
notion
of
non-daters
as
social
misfits
it
also
calls
for
health
promotion
interventions
at
schools
and
elsewhere
to
include
non-dating
as
an
option
for
normal
healthy
development
said
douglas
as
public
health
professionals
we
can
do
a
better
job
of
affirming
that
adolescents
do
have
the
individual
freedom
to
choose
whether
they
want
to
date
or
not
and
that
either
option
is
acceptable
and
healthy
