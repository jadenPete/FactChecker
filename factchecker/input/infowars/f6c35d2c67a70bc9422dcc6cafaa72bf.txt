the

trucking
industry
had
a
blockbuster
year
in
as
high
demand
for
freight
allowed
transportation
companies
to
expand
fleets
but
since
freight
demand
was
artificial
sparked
by
importers
pulling
forward
to
get
ahead
of
tariffs
the
good
times
were
destined
to
end

sharply

a
transportation
manufacturing
recession
is
developing
but
it
didn't
start
overnight
the
first
signs
of
a
slowdown
began
last
summer
when
freight
rates
peaked
last
june
and
have
since
collapsed

specialized
trailers
a
manufacturer
of
specialized
trailers
for
hauling
heavy
things
has
warned
that
in
the
last
three
months
orders
have
plummeted
we
are
planning
for
that
is
not
going
to
be
as
good
said
stuart
sleper
president
of
xl
specialized
trailers
act
research
stressed
that
last
year's
surge
in
trucking
demand
has
led
to
overcapacity
for
the
industry
could
depress
freight
rates
for
the
next
several
years
about
more
capacity
was
brought
online
last
year
or
about
heavy-duty

production
of
heavy-duty
trucks
could
reach
vehicles
this
year
the
second-highest
level
since
act
research
expects
heavy-duty
trucks
to
decline
to
about
vehicles
next
year
a
production
level
that
is
more
in
line
normal
years
it
would
not
take
much
of
a
weaker
gross
domestic
product
to
send
the
truck
industry
down
more
said
don
ake
vice
president
of

vehicles
at

research
group
ftr
ake
said
that
manufacturers
have
already
notified
suppliers
about
future
production
cuts
beginning
this
quarter
he
expects
other
truck
manufacturers
to
start
slashing
production
by
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
quarter
from
current
levels
order
cancellations
have
already
started
to
surge
as
freight
companies
are
beginning
to
realize
the
overcapacity
crisis
dave
de
poincy
president
of
east
manufacturing
said
the
company's
trailer
cancellation
rate
jumped
to
in
late
summer
compared
with
an
average
of
around
he
expects
production
of
trailers
to
drop
later
this
year
they
don't
need
any
more
trailers
right
now
he
said
the
flatbed
industry
is
a
real
indicator
of
economic
health
what's
new
in
this
report
is
that
production
cuts
of
heavy-duty
trucks
and
trailers
are
starting
as
cancellation
requests
soar
couple
this
with
a
transportation
manufacturing
recession
and
the
increasing
possibilities
of
a
full-blown
recession
could
be
as
early
as
next
