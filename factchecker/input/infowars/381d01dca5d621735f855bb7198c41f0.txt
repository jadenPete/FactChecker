republican
party
is
scared
of
us
because
they
know
how
powerful
we
are
they
know
how
powerful
we
are
more
than
sometimes
our
own
frankly
i
think
our
own
party
does
the
far-left
members
of
the
squad
reps
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-ny
ilhan
omar
d-mn
rashida
tlaib
d-mi
and
ayanna
pressley
d-ma
participated
in
an
naacp
forum
wednesday
evening
and
declared
that
members
of
the
republican
party
are
scared
of
them
because
they
know
how
powerful
they
are
ocasio-cortez
talked
about
her
background
as
a
waitress
and
told
the
moderator
angela
rye
that
she
does
not
shy
away
from
her
background
of
working
in
restaurants
because
it
prepared
her
for
her
current
job
as
a
congresswoman
nothing
will
give
you
the
ferocity
of
advocacy
like
having
that
kind
of
experience
ocasio-cortez
said
no
one
can
tell
me
about
things
like
sexual
harassment
no
one
can
tell
me
things
like
working
for
tips
on
a
wage
that
is
less
than
the
minimum
wage
no
one
can
tell
me
about
taking
the
subway
at
o'clock
in
the
morning
home
from
a
night
shift
she
said
claiming
that
no
one
else
has
those
experiences
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
the
msm
is
purposefully
neglecting
to
cover
the
congressional
hearings
uncovering
the
truth
behind
organ
trafficking
in
america
very
few
people
have
those
experiences
and
by
the
way
when
they
do
like
john
boehner
they're
lauded
for
it
they're
like
that's
a
guy
i
could
have
a
beer
with
but
with
me
it's
like
so
she
continued
with
a
gesture
the
freshman
lawmaker
added
that
the
republican
party
is
scared
of
the
squad
it's
because
they're
scared
because
sometimes
i
think
that
the
republican
party
recognizes
our
power
more
than
we
do
sometimes
