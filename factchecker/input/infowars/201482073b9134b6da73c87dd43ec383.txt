why
is
the
cost
of
living
in
cities
so
high
more
than
half
of
the
people
in
the
world
currently
live
in
urban
areas
or
cities
in
spite
of
it
being
more
expensive
to
do
so
why
john
cochrane
has
an
entertaining
and
informative
blog
called
the
grumpy
economist
offering
insights
centered
in
the
chicago
school
approach
that
nonetheless
will
resonate
with
the
austrian
reader
however
in
a
recent
post
cochrane
erroneously
claimed
that
people
living
in
high-rent
areas
of
california
were
effectively
using
a
different
currency
than
other
americans
this
type
of
loose
talk
is
incorrect
as
mises
explained
in
his
classic
work
the
theory
of
money
and
credit
in
this
article
i'll
pinpoint
the
precise
error
involved
to
shed
light
on
how
prices
and
wages
are
set
in
the
market
economy
cochrane
on
price
indicesthe
main
subject
of
cochrane's
post
concerns
the
estimation
of
price
indices
and
the
measured
rate
of
consumer
price
inflation
but
in
the
present
article
i
want
to
focus
on
this
portion
of
cochrane's
commentary
the
next
issue
that
i
think
is
much
under-studied
the
huge
local
variation
in
prices
and
via
huge
variation
in
what
we
consume
the
inflation
experienced
by
people
in
different
parts
of
the
country
living
in
california
and
especially
the
bay
area
is
like
living
in
a
different
country
with
a
different
currency
even
gas
costs
twice
what
it
does
in
the
rest
of
the
country
a
lot
of
what
appears
to
be
income
inequality
is
just
different
prices
and
especially
land
prices
much
of
the
productivity
of
tech
workers
went
in
to
the
pockets
of
existing
land
owners
if
you
get
paid
yen
in
japan
you're
not
times
wealthier
than
someone
who
gets
paid
dollar
in
the
us
being
paid
per
year
in
san
francisco
is
something
like
that
and
being
paid
per
hour
in
much
of
the
us
is
nowhere
near
the
disaster
that
being
paid
that
much
in
san
francisco
would
be
although
cochrane
is
putting
his
finger
on
an
important
point
regarding
estimates
of
income
inequality
his
motivation
is
totally
wrong
yes
if
smith
makes
working
in
san
francisco
while
jones
makes
working
in
cleveland
it
would
be
wrong
to
conclude
that
smith
necessarily
is
enjoying
twice
the
standard
of
living
as
jones
however
cochrane
is
wrong
to
argue
that
this
phenomenon
is
akin
to
different
currencies
being
employed
in
the
two
regions
for
one
thing
we
know
that
it's
u.s.
dollars
being
used
in
both
places
duh
but
more
important
the
fact
that
most
prices
are
higher
in
san
francisco
doesn't
mean
that
dollars-in-san-fran
are
weaker
than
dollars-in-cleveland
the
way
we
can
say
that
the
yen
is
weaker
than
the
dollar
mises
on
the
cost
of
living
and
the
purchasing
power
of
moneymises
addressed
the
fallacy
underlying
cochrane's
argument
but
also
the
germ
of
truth
in
cochrane's
position
in
his
classic
work
the
theory
of
money
and
credit
t
hat
the
cost
of
living
is
different
in
different
localities
only
means
that
the
same
individual
cannot
secure
the
same
degree
of
satisfaction
from
the
same
stock
of
goods
in
different
places
t
he
belief
in
local
differences
in
the
cost
of
living
is
supported
by
reference
to
local
differences
in
the
purchasing
power
of
money
it
is
no
more
appropriate
to
speak
of
a
difference
between
the
purchasing
power
of
money
in
germany
and
in
austria
than
it
would
be
justifiable
to
conclude
from
differences
between
the
prices
charged
by
hotels
on
the
peaks
and
in
the
valleys
of
the
alps
that
the
objective
exchange-value
of
money
is
different
in
the
two
situations
and
to
formulate
some
such
proposition
as
that
the
purchasing
power
of
money
varies
inversely
with
the
height
above
sea-level
the
purchasing
power
of
money
is
the
same
everywhere
only
the
commodities
offered
are
not
the
same
they
differ
in
a
quality
that
is
economically
significant
the
position
in
space
of
the
place
at
which
they
are
ready
for
consumption
but
although
the
exchange-ratios
between
money
and
economic
goods
of
completely
similar
constitution
in
all
parts
of
a
unitary
market
area
in
which
the
same
sort
of
money
is
employed
are
at
any
time
equal
to
one
another
and
all
apparent
exceptions
can
be
traced
back
to
differences
in
the
spatial
quality
of
the
commodities
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
price-differentials
evoked
by
the
difference
in
position
and
hence
in
economic
quality
of
the
commodities
may
under
certain
circumstances
constitute
a
subjective
justification
of
the
assertion
that
there
are
differences
in
the
cost
of
living
mises
the
theory
of
money
and
credit
p
emphasis
in
original
to
drive
home
the
point
mises
then
applies
these
principles
to
the
case
of
karlsbad
which
in
his
day
was
an
attractive
tourist
destination
because
of
its
spa
he
who
voluntarily
visits
karlsbad
on
account
of
his
health
would
be
wrong
in
deducing
from
the
higher
price
of
houses
and
food
there
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
as
much
enjoyment
from
a
given
sum
of
money
in
karlsbad
as
elsewhere
and
that
consequently
living
is
dearer
there
this
conclusion
does
not
allow
for
the
difference
in
quality
of
the
commodities
whose
prices
are
being
compared
it
is
just
because
of
this
difference
in
quality
just
because
it
has
a
certain
value
for
him
that
the
visitor
comes
to
karlsbad
if
he
has
to
pay
more
in
karlsbad
for
the
same
quantity
of
satisfactions
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
paying
for
them
he
is
also
paying
the
price
of
being
able
to
enjoy
them
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
medicinal
springs
the
case
is
different
for
the
businessman
and
laborer
and
official
who
are
merely
tied
to
karlsbad
by
their
occupations
the
propinquity
of
the
waters
has
no
significance
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
wants
and
so
their
having
to
pay
extra
on
account
of
it
for
every
good
and
service
that
they
buy
will
since
they
obtain
no
additional
satisfaction
from
it
appear
to
them
as
a
reduction
of
the
possibilities
of
the
enjoyment
that
they
might
otherwise
have
if
they
compare
their
standard
of
living
with
that
which
they
could
achieve
with
the
same
expenditure
in
a
neighboring
town
they
will
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
living
is
really
dearer
at
the
spa
than
elsewhere
they
will
then
only
transfer
their
activity
to
the
dearer
spa
if
they
believe
that
they
will
be
able
to
secure
there
a
sufficiently
higher
money-income
to
enable
them
to
achieve
the
same
standard
of
living
as
elsewhere
but
in
comparing
the
standards
of
satisfaction
attainable
they
will
leave
out
of
account
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
satisfy
their
wants
in
the
spa
itself
because
this
circumstance
has
no
value
in
their
eyes
every
kind
of
wage
will
therefore
under
the
assumption
of
complete
mobility
be
higher
in
the
spa
than
in
other
cheaper
places
mises
the
theory
of
money
and
credit
pp
as
mises
makes
clear
when
the
cost
of
living
is
relatively
high
in
a
certain
area
it's
because
there
is
something
that
attracts
people
the
higher
density
of
the
population
drives
up
the
price
of
land
which
means
rental
prices
are
higher
this
is
the
market
economy's
way
of
rationing
the
scarce
good
proximity
to
the
region
that
many
people
like
and
allocating
it
to
those
most
willing
to
pay
for
it
cochrane's
mistake
extending
the
analysisthus
far
it
might
seem
as
if
i'm
quibbling
over
semantics
because
mises
seems
to
agree
with
the
spirit
of
cochrane's
observations
however
the
important
difference
and
the
basis
for
my
article
is
that
cochrane
thought
the
higher
cost
of
living
was
akin
to
people
in
san
francisco
using
a
different
currency
and
as
mises
stresses
repeatedly
in
the
passages
i
quoted
above
that
is
simply
not
correct
not
only
do
people
in
san
fran
and
cleveland
both
use
dollars
but
the
dollar
has
the
same
purchasing
power
in
both
places
as
well
if
it
didn't
in
other
words
if
it
really
were
the
case
that
you
could
buy
more
of
the
same
goods
with
in
cleveland
than
you
could
in
san
francisco
then
why
wouldn't
merchants
buy
goods
for
in
cleveland
and
sell
them
for
say
in
san
francisco
netting
a
profit
after
the
costs
of
transportation
were
taken
into
account
once
we
think
through
the
logic
of
arbitrage
we
see
that
cochrane's
throwaway
remark
about
people
in
the
bay
area
using
a
different
currency
is
untenable
people
in
the
bay
area
use
the
same
dollars
as
everywhere
else
in
america
the
reason
prices
are
higher
in
the
bay
area
has
to
do
with
taxes
and
higher
real
estate
prices
for
example
according
to
aaa
gas
prices
in
california
as
of
this
writing
average
per
gallon
while
in
neighboring
nevada
they're
only
this
seems
like
an
odd
discrepancy
why
don't
some
enterprising
fellows
load
up
tanker
trucks
in
reno
and
drive
the
miles
to
san
francisco
to
make
about
cents
per
gallon
delivered
before
subtracting
their
costs
of
transport
the
main
reasons
are
that
california
has
special
environmental
regulations
on
the
gasoline
that
can
be
sold
in
the
state
even
requiring
different
summer
winter
blends
this
means
refiners
have
to
create
gasoline
specifically
for
the
california
market
further
california
enacts
higher
taxes
on
gasoline
than
its
neighbors
in
fact
the
highest
in
the
country
as
this
chart
from
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
reveals
as
the
chart
indicates
the
state
and
local
gas
tax
average
in
california
is
some
cents
higher
per
gallon
than
in
nevada
and
a
whopping
cents
per
gallon
higher
than
in
arizona
obviously
john
cochrane
a
professional
economist
who
taught
at
the
booth
school
of
business
at
chicago
university
understands
the
role
of
taxes
in
affecting
retail
prices
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
category
mistake
to
say
this
disparity
in
prices
is
comparable
to
the
use
of
different
currencies
cigarettes
cost
way
more
in
new
york
city
because
of
the
whopping
taxes
levied
on
them
it's
not
because
new
yorkers
use
a
different
type
of
money
why
do
people
pay
more
to
live
in
big
cities
another
way
to
see
the
flaw
in
cochrane's
analogy
is
to
ask
how
are
these
discrepancies
supported
for
example
if
firm
a
in
cleveland
offers
pay
of
per
year
while
firm
b
in
cleveland
offers
pay
of
million
pennies
per
year
then
that's
actually
the
same
salary
the
monetary
unit
in
the
first
firm
is
dollars
while
in
the
second
it's
pennies
and
the
exchange
rate
between
the
two
is
one
dollar
trades
for
pennies
but
that's
clearly
not
what's
going
on
when
firm
a
in
cleveland
pays
per
year
for
the
same
job
that
pays
in
san
francisco
if
workers
in
either
city
saved
up
from
their
respective
paychecks
and
wired
them
to
their
mothers
back
home
in
florida
say
then
they
would
be
the
same
money
it's
obviously
not
true
that
dollars
earned
in
san
francisco
are
a
different
currency
from
dollars
earned
in
cleveland
the
way
it
really
would
be
a
different
unit
if
a
firm
paid
its
workers
in
pennies
or
japanese
yen
this
raises
the
question
then
of
why
do
workers
move
to
a
big
city
where
the
rent
is
so
high
as
i've
exhaustively
argued
above
this
isn't
a
mere
matter
of
units
dollars
are
the
same
in
san
francisco
but
most
of
the
prices
are
higher
why
do
people
put
up
with
this
the
obvious
answer
is
because
wages
and
salaries
tend
to
be
higher
but
why
don't
we
see
for
example
millions
of
people
living
in
antarctica
it
would
be
really
expensive
to
build
adequate
shelter
and
food
delivery
in
such
an
environment
and
so
in
order
to
get
people
to
move
there
the
wages
of
janitors
in
antarctica
would
have
to
be
astronomical
yet
we
don't
see
this
the
market
outcome
is
that
barely
anybody
lives
in
antarctica
the
brief
explanation
is
that
the
productivity
of
many
types
of
labor
is
much
higher
in
urban
areas
than
elsewhere
historically
the
development
of
the
big
cities
in
the
united
states
was
tied
to
water
transport
new
york
los
angeles
and
houston
are
still
major
port
cities
while
chicago's
access
to
the
great
lakes
and
key
rivers
played
an
important
role
in
its
growth
so
it
wasn't
a
coincidence
that
america's
largest
cities
developed
where
they
did
however
once
people
start
living
in
close
proximity
because
of
some
external
factor
such
as
access
to
the
water
there
is
a
separate
effect
their
productivity
is
amplified
in
other
areas
too
simply
because
of
their
proximity
the
economic
approach
to
cities
is
an
entire
subfield
so
i
won't
dwell
on
it
here
suffice
it
to
say
people
don't
spread
out
uniformly
across
the
land
the
way
electrons
repel
each
other
on
the
surface
of
an
object
to
distribute
the
electric
charge
uniformly
rather
more
than
half
of
the
people
in
the
world
currently
live
in
urban
areas
or
cities
with
projections
that
that
figure
will
rise
to
two-thirds
by
there
must
be
some
reason
for
this
attraction
on
the
consumer
side
it
might
be
the
ability
to
eat
at
the
finest
restaurants
and
go
to
a
broadway
show
if
we're
talking
about
manhattan
on
the
producer
side
it
might
be
because
cities
offer
the
highest
salaries
and
are
worth
moving
to
despite
the
higher
price
for
an
apartment
of
a
certain
size
yet
contrary
to
cochrane
these
high
wages
aren't
due
to
a
difference
in
currency
they
are
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
productivity
of
workers
is
genuinely
higher
the
worker
who
is
paid
in
san
francisco
is
producing
twice
as
much
for
his
employer
as
the
worker
who
is
paid
in
cleveland
this
isn't
because
the
units
are
different
it's
because
the
first
worker
is
genuinely
more
productive
conclusionjohn
cochrane's
remark
that
living
in
the
bay
area
is
like
living
in
a
different
country
with
a
different
currency
is
innocuous
enough
for
everyday
conversation
and
it
also
does
bring
nuance
to
the
debates
over
income
inequality
in
the
united
states
however
strictly
speaking
his
claim
is
economically
nonsense
moreover
when
we
think
through
exactly
what's
wrong
with
it
we
end
up
appreciating
the
intricacies
of
the
market
economy
and
the
role
prices
serve
in
allocating
resources
including
labor
