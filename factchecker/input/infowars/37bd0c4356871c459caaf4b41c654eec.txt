former
chicago
mayor
rahm
emanuel
during
sunday's
broadcast
of
this
week
on
abc
sounded
off
on
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
positions
on
socialist
policies
like
supporting
medicare
for
all
and
wanting
to
provide
free
health
care
for
migrants
emanuel
decried
both
medicare
for
all
and
health
care
for
migrants
calling
them
untenable
for
the
general
election
we've
taken
a
position
so
far
the
candidates
have
through
the
process
few
have
not
about
basically
medicare
for
all
which
is
we're
gonna
eliminate
million
people's
health
care
and
we're
gonna
provide
health
care
to
people
that
just
come
over
the
border
emanuel
outlined
that
is
an
untenable
position
for
the
general
election
he
added
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
to
win
the
primary
you're
literally
hindering
yourself
for
the
general
election
globalism
was
concieved
to
sabotage
the
renaissance
and
plunge
humanity
into
a
new
dark-age
