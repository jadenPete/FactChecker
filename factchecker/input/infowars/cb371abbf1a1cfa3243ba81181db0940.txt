will
be

within
next
year
china's
richest
man
jack
ma
to
step
down
as
chairman
of
e-commerce
giant
one
year
after
announcing
his
intention
to
step
down
as
chairman
of
the
chinese
e-commerce
giant
alibaba
founder
jack
ma
finally
stepped
down
on
tuesday
clearing
the
way
for
his
anointed
successor
ceo
daniel
zhang
to
take
his
place
the
ft
heralded
ma's
retirement
which
took
place
on
alibaba's
th
birthday
as
the
first
transition
at
the
top
of
a
chinese
tech
behemoth
making
it
a
major
milestone
for
the
chinese
tech
industry
ma
is
china's
richest
man
he
famously
built
alibaba
up
from
a
company
founded
in
his
shared
apartment
into
a
behemoth
worth
billion
a
former
schoolteacher
ma
is
also
recognized
for
his
embrace
of
chinese
nationalism
last
year
he
revealed
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
chinese
communist
party
and
his
regular
appearances
at
davos
have
helped
to
cement
his
status
as
one
of
china's
preeminent
business
leaders
but
not
everybody
is
so
rosy
about
ma's
retirement
in
a
tweet
sent
earlier
this
morning
hedge
fund
manager
kyle
bass
a
prominent
china
critic
speculated
that
ma
isn't
actually
retiring
rather
his
carefully
choreographed
decision
to
step
down
is
the
result
of
being
forcibly
removed
from
his
position
stripped
of
his
shareholdings
transferred
to
five
unnamed
individuals
with
the
same
address
and
will
likely
be
jailed
or
disappeared
within
the
next
year
it's
unclear
where
bass
got
this
information
but
the
hedge
fund
manager
insisted
that
this
is
how
xi
and
wang
qishan
vice
president
of
the
ccp
treat
any
chinese
that
become
too
powerful
if
what
bass
says
is
true
it
could
create
serious
problems
for
chinese
markets
as
the
international
investors
that
beijing
is
hoping
to
court
most
recently
by
raising
the
limits
on
foreign
investment
in
its
stock
and
bond
markets
would
undoubtedly
interpret
it
as
a
sign
of
president
xi's
hostility
to
china's
business
community
moreover
it
would
further
bolster
the
perception
that
the
world's
second-largest
economy
lacks
the
rule
of
law
thanks
to
his
regular
appearances
at
davos
and
myriad
other
appearances
in
western
media
ma
recently
sparred
with
elon
musk
about
the
future
of
ai
ma's
disappearance
would
be
impossible
to
ignore
and
because
of
his
still-substantial
holdings
of
alibaba
stock
ma
is
expected
to
continue
guiding
the
company
from
behind
the
scenes
something
that
will
help
bolster
investor
confidence
in
a
company
that
when
it
went
public
in
new
york
a
few
years
back
marked
one
of
the
largest
ipos
of
all
time
as
the
company
raised
roughly
billion
so
far
alibaba
investors
have
been
unfazed
by
ma's
decision
to
retire
the
company's
shares
have
gained
this
year
the
succession
has
been
tediously
planned
and
alibaba
and
ma
often
talk
about
the
company's
deep
bench
of
talent
ma
is
leaving
his
successor
some
lofty
targets
by
ma
hopes
the
alibaba
economy
can
create
million
jobs
support
million
profitable
businesses
and
serve
billion
customers
around
the
world
up
from
around
million
today
the
company
is
also
targeting
trillion
in
gross
merchandise
value
the
aggregate
value
of
all
goods
sold
on
its
platform
this
year
up
from
billion
last
year
in
his
public
remarks
ma
has
remained
committed
to
the
communist
party
line
touting
beijing's
resilience
and
unwillingness
to
cave
to
the
us
even
if
the
trade
war
drags
on
for
decades
but
beijing
has
an
unenviable
track
record
of
exiling
or
jailing
billionaires
often
over
murky
charges
of
corruption
or
tax
evasion
if
bass's
accusations
prove
correct
ma
would
be
the
most
high-profile
figure
to
date
to
meet
this
fate
for
alibaba
shareholders
sake
let's
hope
he
is
wrong
but
given
xi's
totalitarian
bent
it
would
hardly
be
a
surprise
if
ma
met
a
similar
fate
china
was
recently
caught
trying
to
ship
enough
fentanyl
to
kill
billion
people
