declares
we
will
all
be
crushed
by
a
cyborg
hell
on
earth
humanity
has
been
declared
obsolete
by
the
technocratic
overlords
nbc
and
transhumanist
cheerleader
james
lovelock
wants
you
to
know
that
your
days
are
numbered
and
resistance
is
futile
humanity
is
going
to
be
a
thing
of
the
past
as
cyborgs
replace
ages
of
evolution
with
computer
technology
harnessed
in
a
comparable
millisecond
the
globalists
will
of
course
retreat
to
their
redoubts
while
the
rest
of
humanity
encounters
their
replacements
in
the
workplace
and
on
the
battlefield
as
outlandish
as
it
all
sounds
unless
something
is
done
to
severely
counteract
the
inevitable
the
quickening
is
upon
us
and
as
the
globalists
tend
to
do
they
are
merely
stating
their
plan
for
all
to
see
in
plain
sight
