black
holes
could
hide
cores
of
pure
dark
energy
which
are
quite
literally
pushing
apart
our
universe
at
its
very
seams
according
to
an
exciting
new
cosmological
theory
based
on
the
work
of
two
russian
physicists
university
of
hawaii
astrophysicist
kevin
croker
and
mathematician
joel
weiner
examined
some
long-standing
and
far-reaching
scientific
theories
about
the
universe
on
which
a
lot
of
modern
day
astrophysics
is
based
in
doing
so
they
stumbled
upon
an
idea
which
might
force
a
rethink
of
our
interpretations
of
fundamental
physics
it
is
now
clear
that
general
relativity
can
observably
connect
collapsed
stars
regions
the
size
of
honolulu
to
the
behavior
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
over
a
thousand
billion
billion
times
larger
said
croker
russian
physicist
alexander
friedmann
laid
the
foundation
for
the
now
widely-accepted
view
that
the
universe
has
been
steadily
expanding
for
the
past
billion
years
based
on
a
novel
set
of
equations
derived
from
einstein's
work
however
though
useful
friedmann's
equations
were
based
on
the
assumption
that
matter
in
space
of
whatever
kind
is
of
roughly
the
same
type
and
is
spread
out
fairly
evenly
essentially
not
seeing
the
cosmic
wood
for
the
intergalactic
trees
as
under
his
model
smaller
objects
might
be
disregarded
as
not
having
a
big
enough
if
any
effect
on
the
wider
universe
but
croker
and
weiner
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
to
space
and
the
objects
within
if
they
made
some
changes
to
the
fundamental
parameters
of
friendmann's
equations
it
turns
out
the
change
is
quite
drastic
indeed
using
their
updated
model
the
averaged
contributions
of
all
objects
might
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
universe
around
them
and
may
also
cause
them
to
lose
or
gain
energy
depending
on
what
type
of
object
they
are
in
a
russian
physicist
named
erast
gliner
proposed
a
model
in
which
spaces
close
to
the
big
bang
event
may
have
produced
immense
anti-gravitational
effects
spaces
which
appeared
like
black
holes
from
the
outside
but
were
actually
vast
bubbles
of
energy
flexing
against
the
rest
of
the
universe
he
dubbed
these
spaces
generic
objects
of
dark
energy
geodes
building
on
the
work
of
these
two
russian
scientists
croker
and
wiener
believe
that
even
if
just
a
few
ancient
stars
were
to
have
collapsed
into
geodes
it
would
explain
the
universe's
observed
but
as
yet
unexplained
accelerating
expansion
what
we
have
shown
is
that
if
geodes
do
exist
then
they
can
easily
give
rise
to
observed
phenomena
that
presently
lack
convincing
explanations
the
researchers
said
we
anticipate
numerous
other
observational
consequences
of
a
geode
scenario
including
many
ways
to
exclude
it
we've
barely
begun
to
scratch
the
surface
