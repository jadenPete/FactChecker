wxyz
you
need
to
get
him
away

there
are
too

vanderhagen
killian's
mom
used
drugs

a
medical

the

unprovable
the
boy
later
died
while
under

care
a
medical

deemed
the
cause

undetermined
so
vanderhagen
took
to
facebook
to
get
his
story
out
he
blamed
child
protective
services
and
the
broken
court
system
for
his
son's
death

had
a
long
history
of
dealing
with
cps
here's
a
screenshot

some
of
what

evidently
judge

saw
the

felt
uncomfortable
and
possibly
threatened
wxyz
reports
prompting
the
macomb
county
sheriff's
office
to
investigate
the
macomb
county
sheriff's
office
responded
and
found
he
criticized
what
judge
rachel
rancilio
pinned
on
pinterest
as
in
his
opinion
inappropriate
posted
videos
saying
he
feels
she
and
others
responsible
for
killian's
death
and
blamed
the
court
system
for
his
loss
reports
wxyz
police
found
vanderhagen
at
no
time
issued
threats
to
the
judge
however
they
still
took
him
to

he
was
in

was
also
charged
with
malicious
use
of
telecommunications
services

vanderhagen's
mother
says
her
son
is
locked
up
for
exercising
his
rights
under
the
first

and
that
he
only
wants
for
those
responsible
to
face
justice
