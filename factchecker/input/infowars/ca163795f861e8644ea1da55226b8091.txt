bolton
resigns
over
leaks
to
press
in
addition
to
war
advocacy
now-former
nsa
was
originally
not
invited
to
white
house
meeting
last
month
over
fears
he
would
reveal
too
much
to
press
president
trump
has
asked
his
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
to
resign
adding
that
he
disagreed
strongly
with
many
of
his
foreign
policy
suggestions
but
reports
indicate
that
bolton
was
also
suspected
of
leaking
to
the
press
back
in
april
bolton
was
accused
of
leaking
to
the
press
and
on
a
similar
note
the
president's
personal
secretary
was
recently
asked
to
resign
after
having
an
off-the-record
conversation
with
a
journalist
who
apparently
reported
on
the
information
anyway
additionally
bolton
was
notably
not
originally
invited
to
the
president's
meeting
last
month
regarding
a
peace
deal
that
would
be
presented
to
afghan
and
taliban
officials
out
of
fears
he
would
leak
information
to
the
press
according
to
the
week
when
the
president's
top
aides
were
preparing
for
a
meeting
at
trump's
golf
resort
in
new
jersey
last
month
to
discuss
the
peace
deal
that
would
be
presented
to
afghan
and
taliban
officials
in
kabul
afghanistan
and
doha
qatar
bolton
was
reportedly
not
originally
invited
out
of
concern
that
he
would
oppose
the
agenda
and
leak
info
to
the
press
after
the
meeting
the
outlet
reported
given
that
bolton's
foreign
war
advocacy
ran
into
direct
opposition
of
the
president
itself
it
wouldn't
be
surprising
if
he
used
the
press
to
gain
extra
leverage
for
his
positions
furthermore
during
a
june
interview
with
nbc
president
trump
indicated
that
he
has
both
war
hawks
like
bolton
and
war
doves
in
his
administration
so
he
can
have
input
from
all
sides
of
a
debate
john
bolton
is
absolutely
a
hawk
the
president
told
nbc
back
in
june
if
it
was
up
to
him
he'd
take
on
the
whole
world
at
one
time
okay
this
implies
that
bolton
wasn't
canned
only
because
of
his
war
advocacy
which
the
president
pushed
back
against
anyway
but
also
for
having
a
reputation
for
leaking
ironically
enough
before
he
became
the
national
security
advisor
bolton
had
blasted
leaks
coming
out
of
the
white
house
as
completely
unacceptable
