long-term
opioid
use
linked
to
low
testosterone
researchers
intend
to
screen
more
men
to
solidify
findings
long-term
opioid
use
previously
has
been
linked
with
low
testosterone
in
men
what
has
been
unclear
is
how
many
men
taking
opioids
had
been
screened
or
treated
for
low
testosterone
a
new
study
by
researchers
from
the
university
of
texas
medical
branch
at
galveston
has
found
a
very
low
rate
of
screening
for
low
testosterone
a
surprising
finding
given
that
a
link
is
known
utmb
researchers
conducted
the
first
large-scale
nationally
representative
investigation
of
how
many
of
the
men
with
extended
opioid
prescriptions
were
screened
and
if
needed
treated
for
low
testosterone
although
more
men
taking
long-term
opioids
were
screened
for
low
testosterone
than
men
who
only
took
opioids
for
a
short
period
these
rates
were
surprisingly
lower
than
expected
based
on
previous
smaller
studies
the
findings
are
currently
available
in
mayo
clinic
proceedings
innovations
quality
outcomes
earlier
studies
have
shown
that
low
testosterone
which
is
associated
with
muscle
wasting
weight
gain
osteoporosis
low
libido
and
infertility
has
been
linked
with
opioid
use
in
to
percent
of
cases
opiates
inhibit
the
release
of
chemicals
in
the
brain
that
trigger
testosterone
production
in
the
testis
given
the
dramatic
increase
in
opioid
use
over
the
past
years
it's
likely
that
opioid-induced
low
testosterone
is
becoming
increasingly
common

in
the

of
preventive
medicine
and
community
health
this
situation
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
men's
health
and
quality
of
life
after
a
report
about
the
opioid
crisis
on
minutes
gavin
mcinnes
exposes
that
minutes
was
paid
to
put
blame
on
the
doctors
and
not
on
the
pharmaceutical
company
itself
using
one
of
the
nation's
largest
commercial
insurance
databases
the
researchers
identified
men
aged
years
or
older
who
had
or
more
days
of
opioid
prescriptions
in
a
single
month
period
between
january
and
december
with
no
history
of
low
testosterone
or
testosterone
therapy
in
the
year
before
the
researchers
compared
this
group
of
men
with
men
who
received
or
fewer
days
of
opioid
prescriptions
that
were
otherwise
familiar
although
the
rate
of
low
testosterone
screening
diagnosis
and
treatment
was
higher
among
men
with
prolonged
opioid
prescriptions
than
those
only
taking
opioids
for
a
brief
period
these
numbers
were
lower
than
expected
this
finding
suggests
a
wide
underscreening
of
opioid-induced
low-testosterone
but
it's
not
clear
what
factors
drove
this
low
rate
said
baillargeon
it
may
reflect
a
lack
of
awareness
among
some
clinicians
or
a
reluctance
to
screen
for
conditions
that
would
require
additional
medications
in
patients
who
already
have
complex
conditions
and
treatment
plans
from
a
patient's
perspective
it's
possible
that
men
who
are
struggling
with
chronic
pain
and
related
conditions
are
less
concerned
than
their
peers
about
low
testosterone
symptoms
and
are
therefore
less
likely
to
bring
these
symptoms
to
the
attention
to
their
physician
opioid
manufacturers
are
looking
at
b
in
lawsuits
for
knowingly
lying
and
pushing
the
drugs
