fitter
adults

healthier
brains
study
exercise
is
indeed
good
for
your
mind
in
a
large
study
german
scientists
have
shown
that
physical
fitness
is
associated
with
better
brain
structure
and
brain
functioning
in
young
adults
this
opens
the
possibility
that
increasing
fitness
levels
may
lead
to
improved
cognitive
ability
such
as
memory
and
problem
solving
as
well
as
improved
structural
changes
in
the
brain
this
work
is
presented
for
the
first
time
at
the
ecnp
congress
in
copenhagen
with
simultaneous
publication
in
the
peer-reviewed
journal
scientific
reports
scientists
have
previously
shown
that
exercise
is
good
for
the
brain
but
most
studies
have
not
controlled
for
underlying
causes
which
might
give
distorted
results
such
as
body
weight
blood
glucose
levels
education
status
age
and
other
factors
making
it
difficult
to
take
an
overall
view
of
the
benefits
in
addition
studies
have
rarely
looked
at
fitness
in
relations
to
both
brain
structure
and
mental
functioning
the
scientists
used
a
publicly
available
database
of
mri
brain
scans
from
the
human
connectome
project
which
had
been
contributed
by
volunteers
who
wanted
to
contribute
to
scientific
research
the
volunteers
average
age
years
old
underwent
some
additional
testing
the
first
test
was
a
two-minute
walking
test
where
each
person
was
asked
to
walk
as
fast
as
possible
for
minutes
and
the
distance
was
then
measured
the
volunteers
then
underwent
a
series
of
cognitive
tests
to
measure
such
things
as
memory
sharpness
judgement
and
reasoning

said
the
great
strength
of
this
work
is
the
size
of
the
database
normally
when
you
are
dealing
with
mri
work
a
sample
of
is
pretty
good
but
the
existence
of
this
large
mri
database
allowed
us
to
eliminate
possibly
misleading
factors
and
strengthened
the
analysis
considerably
the
tests
were
able
to
show
two
main
points
better
performance
on
a
minute
walking
test
in
young
healthy
adults
is
associated
with
better
cognitive
performance
and
with
structural
integrity
of
the
white
matter
in
the
brain
healthy
white
matter
is
known
to
improve
the
speed
and
quality
of
nerve
connections
in
the
brain
repple
continued
it
surprised
us
to
see
that
even
in
a
young
population
cognitive
performance
decreases
as
fitness
levels
drops
we
knew
how
this
might
be
important
in
an
elderly
population
which
does
not
necessarily
have
good
health
but
to
see
this
happening
in
year-olds
is
surprising
this
leads
us
to
believe
that
a
basic
level
of
fitness
seems
to
be
a
preventable
risk
factor
for
brain
health
this
type
of
study
raises
an
important
question
we
see
that
fitter
people
have
better
brain
health
so
we
now
need
to
ask
whether
actually
making
people
fitter
will
improve
their
brain
health
finding
this
out
is
our
next
step
there
are
some
trials
which
point
in
that
direction
but
if
we
can
prove
this
using
such
a
large
database
this
would
be
very
significant
commenting
professor
peter
falkai
university
clinic
munich
germany
said
this
is
an
important
cross-sectional
study
demonstrating
a
robust
correlation
between
physical
health
and
cognitive
functioning
in
a
large
cohort
of
healthy
young
adults
this
correlation
was
backed
by
changes
in
the
white
matter
status
of
the
brain
supporting
the
notion
that
better
macro-connectivity
is
related
to
better
brain
functioning
it
stresses
the
importance
of
physical
activity
at
all
stages
of
life
and
as
preliminary
recent
evidence
suggests
one
can
start
improving
physical
health
even
in
later
life
even
if
one
has
never
trained
before
see
reference
these
findings
however
need
to
be
replicated
in
longitudinal
studies
and
translated
for
the
use
in
mental
illness
