leftist
study
calls
for
banning
small
clusters
of
right-wing
thought
criminals
to
avoid
inflaming
the
entire
hive
this
paper
could
give
us
a
clue
as
to
why
they
appear
to
be
aiming
to
pick
right-wingers
off
one
by
one
rather
than
all
at
once
a
team
of
researchers
led
by
a
professor
at
george
washington
university
released
a
paper
last
month
which
called
for
a
slow
but
steady
stream
of
mass
bannings
on
social
media
and
reviving
cointelpro-style
infiltration
techniques
to
fight
so-called
hate
groups
as
we've
learned
over
the
past
three
years
a
hate
group
is
now
defined
as
anyone
the
adl
and
our
ruling
big
tech
oligarchs
want
to
censor
whether
it's
fox
news
hosts
like
tucker
carlson
left-wing
politicians
like
tulsi
gabbard
or
someone
like
right-wing
commentator
james
allsup
who
was
just
banned
from
youtube
despite
having
zero
strikes
on
his
channel
youtube
last
week
banned
multiple
right-wing
channels
and
deleted
multiple
videos
from
those
on
an
adl
list
only
to
later
unban
a
few
of
the
smaller
channels
they
took
down
without
any
explanation
this
paper
could
give
us
a
clue
as
to
why
they
appear
to
be
aiming
to
pick
right-wingers
off
one
by
one
rather
than
all
at
once
from
the
verge
how
do
you
get
rid
of
hate
speech
on
social
platforms
until
now
companies
have
generally
tried
two
approaches
one
is
to
ban
individual
users
who
are
caught
posting
abuse
the
other
is
to
ban
the
large
pages
and
groups
where
people
who
practice
hate
speech
organize
and
promote
their
noxious
views
but
what
if
this
approach
is
counterproductive
that's
the
argument
in
an
intriguing
new
paper
out
today
in
nature
from
neil
johnson
a
professor
of
physics
at
george
washington
university
and
researchers
at
gw
and
the
university
of
miami
the
paper
hidden
resilience
and
adaptive
dynamics
of
the
global
online
hate
ecology
explores
how
hate
groups
organize
on
facebook
and
russian
social
network
vkontakte
and
how
they
resurrect
themselves
after
platforms
ban
them
dave
chappelle's
new
politically
incorrect
netflix
special
is
being
panned
by
critics
yet
is
loved
by
the
general
public
illustrating
once
again
how
americans
are
sick
of
being
lectured
by
woke
idiots
about
what
they're
allowed
to
laugh
at
as
noemi
derzsy
writes
in
her
summary
in
nature
johnson
et
al
show
that
online
hate
groups
are
organized
in
highly
resilient
clusters
the
users
in
these
clusters
are
not
geographically
localized
but
are
globally
interconnected
by
highways
that
facilitate
the
spread
of
online
hate
across
different
countries
continents
and
languages
when
these
clusters
are
attacked
for
example
when
hate
groups
are
removed
by
social-media
platform
administrators
fig
the
clusters
rapidly
rewire
and
repair
themselves
and
strong
bonds
are
made
between
clusters
formed
by
users
shared
between
them
analogous
to
covalent
chemical
bonds
in
some
cases
two
or
more
small
clusters
can
even
merge
to
form
a
large
cluster
in
a
process
the
authors
liken
to
the
fusion
of
two
atomic
nuclei
using
their
mathematical
model
the
authors
demonstrated
that
banning
hate
content
on
a
single
platform
aggravates
online
hate
ecosystems
and
promotes
the
creation
of
clusters
that
are
not
detectable
by
platform
policing
which
the
authors
call
dark
pools
where
hate
content
can
thrive
unchecked
in
the
paper
the
authors
offer
a
choice
metaphor
for
platforms
current
approach
these
two
approaches
are
equivalent
to
attempts
to
try
to
understand
how
water
boils
by
looking
for
a
bad
particle
in
a
sea
of
billions
even
though
there
is
not
one
for
phase
transitions
or
the
macroscopic
viewpoint
that
the
entire
system
is
to
blame
akin
to
thermodynamics
yet
the
correct
science
behind
extended
physical
phenomena
lies
at
the
mesoscale
in
the
self-organized
cluster
dynamics
of
the
developing
correlations
with
the
same
thought
to
be
true
for
many
social
science
settings
so
what
to
do
instead
the
researchers
advocate
a
four-step
approach
to
reduce
the
influence
of
hate
networks
identify
smaller
more
isolated
clusters
of
hate
speech
and
ban
those
users
instead
instead
of
wiping
out
entire
small
clusters
ban
small
samples
from
each
cluster
at
random
this
would
theoretically
weaken
the
cluster
over
time
without
inflaming
the
entire
hive
recruit
users
opposed
to
hate
speech
to
engage
with
members
of
the
larger
hate
clusters
directly
the
authors
explain
in
our
data
some
white
supremacists
call
for
a
unified
europe
under
a
hitler-like
regime
and
others
oppose
a
united
europe
similar
in-fighting
exists
between
hate-clusters
of
the
kkk
movement
adding
a
third
population
in
a
pre-engineered
format
then
allows
the
hate-cluster
extinction
time
to
be
manipulated
globally
identify
hate
groups
with
competing
views
and
pit
them
against
one
another
in
an
effort
to
sow
doubt
in
the
minds
of
participants
i
find
these
strategies
fascinating
even
if
i
wonder
how
pragmatic
they
are
particularly
the
latter
two
are
basically
diametrically
opposed
to
existing
platform
policy
the
first
point
which
the
authors
document
with
a
forbidding
amount
of
math
strikes
me
as
the
most
persuasive
another
researcher
natalie
bucklin
recently
posted
a
similar
analysis
of
twitter's
hate
clusters
that
also
found
large
groups
connected
by
a
few
big
nodes
just
as
johnson's
team
did
johnson's
team
is
currently
developing
software
that
it
hopes
will
aid
regulators
and
software
platforms
as
they
consider
new
interventions
into
hate
speech
note
how
the
verge
journo
casey
newton
is
literally
cheering
this
orwellian
censorship
scheme
that's
pretty
much
par
for
the
course
for
your
modern
journo-ist
these
days
though
they
go
around
writing
article
after
article
pushing
for
people
to
be
censored
by
our
big
tech
overlords
they
love
to
act
like
they're
defenders
of
the
free
press
and
they're
being
persecuted
by
drumpf
because
he
calls
them
fake
news
that
said
one
of
the
key
parts
worth
noting
in
their
report
is
their
call
to
effectively
revive
cointelpro
by
adding
a
third
population
in
a
pre-engineered
format
to
get
groups
to
fight
with
one
another
and
sow
doubt
in
the
minds
of
participants
that's
how
the
fbi
took
down
black
nationalist
groups
like
the
black
panthers
in
the
s
the
fbi
was
just
caught
using
similar
tactics
on
chan
though
such
tactics
were
widely
condemned
by
leftists
in
the
past
now
they're
all
for
them
because
they
think
their
enemies
will
be
in
the
crosshairs
incidentally
the
establishment
right
over
at
the
national
review
also
called
for
cointelpro
to
be
revived
in
august
to
fight
what
they
called
white
hate
as
a
reminder
the
nro
defended
jeffrey
epstein
and
worked
to
rehabilitate
his
image
after
his
child
solicitation
conviction
while
all
these
establishment
shills
think
scrapping
the
bill
of
rights
and
endorsing
mass
censorship
will
bring
about
a
utopia
the
actual
aim
of
our
ruling
oligarchs
appears
to
be
to
bring
about
a
prog-globalist
dystopia
where
even
manual
laborers
will
be
labeled
thought
criminals
if
they
dare
to
complain
about
having
to
work
in
a
wage
cage
