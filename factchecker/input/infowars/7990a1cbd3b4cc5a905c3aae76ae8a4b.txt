noted
president
trump
on
monday
slammed
democrat
support
for
infanticide
during
a
rally
in
fayetteville
north
carolina
monday
night
specifically
calling
attention
to
gov
ralph
northam's
d-va
despicable
comments
about
post-birth
abortions
virtually
every
top
democrat
also
now
supports
late-term
abortion
the
president
said
ripping
babies
straight
from
the
mother's
womb
right
up
to
the
moment
of
birth
trump
added
that
gov
northam's
comments
about
post-birth
abortions
were
indicative
of
how
far-left
the
party
has
gone
on
the
issue
and
if
you
look
at
virginia
the
governor
of
virginia
he
was
even
talking
about
essentially
you
would
say
an
execution
he
was
talking
after
the
baby
is
born
the
doctor
will
talk
to
the
mother
and
they'll
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
that
baby
lives
this
is
a
radical
democrat
idea
that's
why
i've
asked
congress
to
prohibit
extreme
late-term
abortion
because
republicans
believe
that
every
child
is
a
sacred
gift
from
god
northam
back
in
january
went
on
radio
station
wtop
and
defended
a
week
abortion
ban
proposed
by
the
state's
democrats
weeks
is
typically
considered
the
end
term
of
a
pregnancy
but
northam
offered
an
example
in
which
a
baby
would
be
brought
to
term
delivered
then
parents
and
doctors
would
decide
whether
it
would
stay
alive
if
a
mother
is
in
labor
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
would
happen
the
infant
would
be
delivered
the
infant
would
be
kept
comfortable
the
infant
would
be
resuscitated
if
that's
what
the
mother
and
the
family
desired
and
then
a
discussion
would
ensue
between
the
physicians
and
the
mother

tuesday
