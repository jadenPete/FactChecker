this
is
a
uniquely
american
problem
and
it
requires
a
national
solution
particularly
now
that
we're
back
in
an
election
cycle

it
seems
to

are
going
to
want
to
be
able

be
in
a
position

danielle
pletka
offered
a
more
fatalistic
takeaway
i
think
that
actually
the
opposite
of
what
you
suggest
is
happening
i
think
that
the
more
we
see
this
the
more
casualties
there
are
the
more
gun
violence
there
is
the
more
numb
people
are
and
the
less
response
we're
going
to
get
she
said
to
me
it's
like
terrorism
people
get
used
to
it
