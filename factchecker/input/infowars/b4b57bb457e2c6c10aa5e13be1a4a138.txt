august
fbi
background
checks
for
sales
surged
over
august
august
gun
sales
were
up
thanks
to
democrats
totalitarian
demands
for
mandatory
buybacks
those
who
bought
guns
were
americans
seeking
self-protection
and
with
deep
concerns
that
president
donald
trump
is
on
board
with
gun
control
according
to
the
washington
examiner
the
overall
number
of
background
checks
recorded
in
the
national
instant
criminal
background
check
system
surged
those
numbers
were
courtesy
of
the
national
shooting
sports
foundation
nssf
that
figure
includes
background
checks
done
for
security
concealed
carry
permits
and
gun
sales
and
was
the
highest
august
number
ever
recorded
adjusted
for
sales
the
nssf
industry
group
said
that
august
fbi
background
checks
for
sales
surged
over
august
the
adjusted
august
number
was
second
only
to
august
during
the
heated
presidential
election
it's
become
evident
that
gun
control
authoritarians
are
the
best
gun
salespeople
on
the
planet
trump's
rhetoric
on
guns
and
his
apparent
desire
to
curb
the
gun
rights
of
innocent
people
is
likely
also
playing
a
role
in
the
increase
in
gun
sales
the
new
surge
came
in
the
wake
of
heightened
pressure
for
gun
control
sales
bans
on
military-style
rifles
limits
on
ammo
and
a
slew
of
democrats
saying
they
will
take
guns
at
the
end
of
a
gun
but
force
justin
anderson
the
marketing
director
for
hyatt
guns
in
charlotte
north
carolina
one
of
the
nation's
largest
sellers
said
fears
of
a
liberal
gun
grab
and
a
drive
for
self-protection
are
pushing
sales
higher
as
we've
seen
in
the
past
the
recent
publicizing
of
mass
shootings
has
fueled
people's
concerns
about
their
personal
safety
we
are
seeing
many
first-time
gun
buyers
and
our
concealed
carry
classes
are
booking
up
quickly
said
anderson
political
figures
talking
about
gun
bans
and
confiscation
is
also
starting
to
figure
into
sales
we've
seen
a
slight
uptick
in
the
sale
of
tactical
rifles
as
a
result
he
added
washington
examiner
democrats
continue
to
prove
themselves
to
be
the
best
people
to
drive
up
gun
sales
they
are
literally
making
their
goal
of
an
enslaved
populace
harder
by
spewing
propaganda
seconds
after
a
mass
shooting
it
looks
like
innocent
people
don't
like
being
told
they
aren't
allowed
to
protect
themselves
and
considering
the
second
amendment
was
written
to
protect
americans
from
tyrants
it
makes
sense
that
democrats
want
it
gone
while
free
people
