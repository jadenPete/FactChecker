like
most
government
central-planning
schemes
zoning
laws
raise
the
cost
of
living
zoning
laws
grew
out
of
a
european
city-planning
movement
pioneered
by
municipal
socialists
in
the
classic
video
game
sim
city
players
acting
as
the
mayor
of
a
simulated
city
begin
by
allocating
space
by
industrial
residential
and
commercial
zones
there
is
no
option
in
the
game
to
have
overlapping
districts
where
a
department
store
might
sit
next
to
a
middle-class
home
the
very
idea
would
seem
absurd
to
modern
minds
which
typically
accept
city
zoning
as
an
intuitive
and
unquestionable
element
of
city
governance
but
prior
to
the
twentieth
century
zoning
did
not
exist
in
the
united
states
zoning
laws
grew
out
of
a
european
city-planning
movement
pioneered
by
municipal
socialists
such
as
the
british
fabian
society
members
who
advocated
socialism
by
municipal
governments
various
ideas
for
the
aesthetic
planning
of
cities
were
implemented
in
different
countries
but
zoning
was
a
german
innovation
building
regulations
were
not
unknown
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
but
in
frankfurt
became
the
first
city
to
divide
its
territory
into
different
districts
with
distinct
regulations
berlin
passed
a
similar
ordinance
the
following
year
like
other
city
planning
policies
one
of
the
original
aims
of
zoning
was
to
limit
land
speculation
this
being
the
height
of
popularity
for
henry
george's
single-tax
plan
even
in
europe
once
the
idea
was
conceived
though
the
broad
potential
of
zoning
laws
for
city
planners
was
easy
to
see
by
passing
strategic
regulations
for
specified
zones
planners
could
decide
as
in
sim
city
what
parts
of
the
city
would
be
industrial
what
parts
would
be
commercial
and
where
people
would
live
aesthetic
considerations
were
quickly
adopted
by
regulators
but
at
its
core
zoning
was
a
scheme
to
allow
city
planners
to
escape
the
tyranny
of
market
prices
as
historian
daniel
rodgers
puts
it
at
its
most
ambitious
zoning
was
a
device
to
map
out
in
advance
of
the
price
system
the
shape
of
the
city's
development
with
the
benefit
of
austrian
price
theory
it
is
easy
to
foresee
the
consequences
of
evading
the
price
system
in
city
development
the
choice
of
location
for
businesses
and
residencies
has
to
consider
a
complex
array
of
variables
each
of
which
interact
with
the
rest
of
the
economy
city
planners
attempted
to
consider
economic
factors
when
outlining
zones
such
as
the
proximity
of
industrial
zones
to
railroad
lines
and
commercial
harbors
but
as
mises
would
demonstrate
in
only
individual
entrepreneurs
using
market
prices
could
determine
the
most
economical
allocation
of
resources
industrial
operations
that
required
larger
tracts
of
land
for
instance
may
find
it
more
cost-effective
to
absorb
higher
transportation
costs
in
favor
of
cheaper
land
outside
of
the
allocated
zones
zoning
can
raise
the
costs
of
living
and
doing
business
but
it
can
never
lower
it
when
zoning
was
introduced
to
the
united
states
though
aesthetic
and
economic
concerns
were
not
the
only
policy
motivators
los
angeles
established
the
first
zoning
law
in
in
order
to
prevent
nuisances
from
invading
residential
areas
while
this
included
provisions
to
prevent
unsightly
factories
from
being
constructed
near
private
homes
the
racial
element
of
the
law
was
no
secret
chinese
immigrants
who
typically
lived
in
their
place
of
business
were
forced
to
close
their
shops
in
the
newly
defined
residential
areas
and
move
to
industrial
zones
california
courts
maintained
that
the
city
was
not
obligated
to
compensate
businesses
owners
for
the
costs
of
uprooting
their
lives
in
new
york
city
passed
the
first
comprehensive
german-style
zoning
law
unlike
los
angeles
the
new
york
plan
divided
the
entire
city
into
zones
los
angeles's
law
left
portions
of
the
city
unzoned
the
act
was
lobbied
for
by
high-class
merchants
who
were
growing
concerned
with
the
growth
of
immigrant
workers
crowding
fifth
avenue
around
their
stores
offending
the
sensibilities
of
their
well-to-do
customers
this
was
the
product
of
textile
manufacturers
seeking
cheaper
access
to
the
retailers
they
sold
to
which
in
the
pre-automobile
days
also
meant
the
construction
of
working-class
apartments
the
merchant's
association
concocted
a
solution
in
establishing
zones
to
regulate
the
height
of
buildings
their
shops
did
not
need
to
be
as
tall
as
tenement
apartment
buildings
the
law
was
designed
as
a
concerted
effort
at
segregating
undesirable
classes
and
it
also
meant
textile
manufacturers
had
to
absorb
the
cost
of
relocating
to
areas
where
they
would
have
access
to
workers
after
los
angeles
and
new
york
led
the
way
more
cities
began
adopting
zoning
laws
the
growth
in
zoning
regulations
grew
steadily
through
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
and
around
zoning
regulations
exploded
as
city
planners
sought
to
control
increasingly
minute
details
of
city
development
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
residual
costs
of
zoning
regulations
especially
regarding
the
commercial
consequences
but
the
correlation
between
zoning
regulations
and
housing
costs
is
well-established
california
and
new
york
not
only
introduced
zoning
laws
to
the
united
states
they
remain
home
to
some
of
the
most
zone-regulated
districts
in
the
country
in
a
recent
study
of
the
twenty-five
least
affordable
housing
markets
california
counties
claim
seventeen
spots
on
the
list
with
new
york
occupying
five
hawaii
takes
the
last
two
by
contrast
houston
is
famous
for
its
lack
of
zoning
laws
though
they
do
have
building
regulations
and
it
is
consistently
one
the
most
affordable
housing
markets
for
large
cities
one
of
the
original
selling
points
of
zoning
regulations
that
survives
today
was
that
zoning
protect
and
enhances
property
values
this
is
certainly
true
but
the
very
argument
is
a
roundabout
way
of
admitting
that
zoning
laws
make
it
more
difficult
for
people
to
become
home
owners
rising
property
values
are
nice
for
those
who
own
property
but
they
raise
the
barriers
to
home
ownership
and
business
startups
for
everybody
else
