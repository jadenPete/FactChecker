the
jovial
nature
of
the
cookout
contrasted
with
the
rather
more
serious
reason
for
their
protest
an
ordinance
went
into
effect
on
july
st
which
made
public
camping
no
longer
a
citable
offense
it
was
previously
an
offense
to
be
sitting
or
lying
down
on
public
sidewalks
or
sleeping
outdoors
austin
police
issued
citations
between
and
for
anyone
doing
so
however
as
shroyer
pointed
out
it
is
still
an
offense
to
do
so
in
the
area
in
front
of
city
hall
itself
which
is
why
he
decided
to
pitch
his
own
mini
tent
city
right
in
front
of
them
the
change
has
caused
trouble
for
the
residents
of
the
city
with
tent
cities
popping
up
everywhere
people
are
having
cookouts
under
i
and
and
according
to
shroyer
craig
staley
a
local
business
owner
told
the
washington
post
that
the
decision
was
making
him
question
his
own
party
allegiances
i
got
two
emails
last
month
from
customers
who
said
i
can't
go
to
your
store
anymore
because
it
smells
like
urine
i
am
a
democrat
at
heart
i
have
been
in
austin
texas
for
over
years
but
i
am
telling
you
i
am
feeling
a
lot
more
red
these
days
when
it
comes
to
my
business
owen
shroyer
feeds
the
homeless
outside
of
city
hall
the
war
room
goes
mobile
as
owen
shroyer
feeds
austin's
homeless
right
from
the
comfort
of
his
very
own
tent
city
owen
explains
why
all
americans
should
be
concerned
about
failing
liberal
policies
that
ruin
the
inner
cities
alex
jones
told
the
national
file
that
the
biggest
issue
was
that
the
city
is
now
calling
the
homeless
campers
they're
telling
them
to
come
here
the
mayor
told
am
like
a
month
ago
that
they're
doing
this
to
bring
more
attention
to
the
homeless
but
the
city
council
here's
the
key
they
exempted
themselves
people
have
signed
a
petition
to
rescind
the
homeless
camping
ordinance
in
austin
on
change
org
claiming
that
the
result
has
been
chaos
homeless
people
are
camping
on
sidewalks
downtown
in
front
of
businesses
there
have
been
several
violent
attacks
and
they
continue
to
camp
in
parks
and
on
private
property
believing
that
they
either
won't
be
reported
to
police
or
police
won't
remove
them
it
is
time
to
rescind
this
policy
which
is
bad
for
tourism
the
austin
economy
public
safety
and
public
health
shroyer
was
slightly
upset
at
the
petition
reaching
such
high
numbers
why
would
you
want
to
shut
down
the
tent
city
cookout
he
asked
we're
gonna
be
grilling
out
here
