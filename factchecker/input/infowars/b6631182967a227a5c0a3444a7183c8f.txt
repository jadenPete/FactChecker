joe

and
beto
o'rourke
went
after
the
second
amendment
following
this
weekend's
mass
shooting
in
texas
on
sunday
o'rourke
told
msnbc
that
if
elected
he
would
pass
red
flag
laws
and
confiscate
ak-
s
and
ar-
s
by
force
yes
that
means
men
armed
with
semi-automatic
rifles
would
come
and
take
semi-automatic
rifles
from
law-abiding
americans
under
a
beto
o'rourke
presidency
and
more
importantly
and
politically
difficult
to
say
buy
those
weapons
of
war
back
mandate
that
not
voluntarily
let's
be
clear
with
our
fellow
americans
no
place
for
an
ak-
or
an
ar-
on
the
streets
of
our
communities

september
in
charlottesville
virginia
on
sunday
beto
was
asked
how
he'd
reassure
people
who
are
afraid
the
government
would
take
their
assault
weapons
away
and
instead
of
reassuring
them
he
warned
them
they
would
indeed
have
to
give
up
their
rifles
i
want
to
be
really
clear
that
that's
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
do
he
said
if
you
own
an
ak-
or
ar-
you'll
have
to
sell
them
to
the
government
we
need
to
buy
back
every
single
assault
weapon

august
during
a
cedar
rapids
iowa
campaign
stop
on
monday
joe
biden
also
addressed
the
second
amendment
saying
the
idea
that
we
don't
have
elimination
of
assault-type
weapons
whatever
that
means
magazines
that
can
hold
multiple
bullets
in
them
which
is
every
magazine
on
the
planet
is
absolutely
mindless
it
is
no
violation
of
the
second
amendment
it's
just
a
bow
to
the
special
interests
of
the
gun
manufacturers
and
the
nra
he
finished
biden
also
voiced
his
anger
at
the
state
of
texas
for
loosening
its
gun
laws
in
the
face
of
the
latest
mass
shooting
and
we're
talking
about
loosening
access
to
have
guns
to
be
able
to
take
them
into
places
of
worship
i
mean
it
is
absolutely
irrational
it's
totally
irrational
he
said
even
democrat
presidential
hopeful
julian
castro
gave
his
two
cents
saying
often
times
it's
actually
hunters
and
folks
that
shoot
on
a
range
that
understand
that
you
don't
need
these
weapons
of
war
however
pro-gun
talk
show
host
dana
loesch
countered
his
statement
saying
a
bolt
action
rifle
then
is
a
weapon
of
war
so
is
a
mm
handgun
the
purpose
of
this
shift
in
terminology
is
to
graduate
towards
a
full
ban
of
all
semi
auto
firearms

september
make
no
mistake
when
it
comes
to
firearms
the
democrat
agenda
is
confiscation
these
uninformed
democrats
are
either
too
dumb
to
understand
the
ramifications
of
their
suggested
action
or
they
actually
want
a
civil
war
