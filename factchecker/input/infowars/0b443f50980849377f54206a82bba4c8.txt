a
simple

urine
test
developed
by
imperial
and
mit
engineers
has
produced
a
color

signal

tools
that
detect
cancer
in
its
early
stages
can

and

however
cancer
screening
approaches
often
call
for
expensive
equipment
and
trips
to
the
clinic
which
may
not
be
feasible
in
rural
or
developing
areas
with
little

infrastructure
the
emerging
field
of
point-of-care
diagnostics
is
therefore
working
on

and
easier-to-use
tests
an
international
pair
of
engineering
labs
have
now
developed
a
tool
that
changes
the
color
of
mouse

is
present

said
by
taking
advantage
of
a
chemical
reaction
that
produces
a
color
change
this
test
can
be
administered
without
the
need
for

hard-to-use
lab
instruments
the
simple

could
potentially

tumors
grow
and

they
often
produce
biological
signals
known
as
biomarkers
that
clinicians
use
to
both
detect
and
track
disease
however
not
all
biomarkers
play
an
active
role
in
tumor
growth
and
most
are
present
in
such
small
quantities
that
they
can
be
challenging
to
find
one
family
of
tumor
proteins
known
as
matrix
metalloproteinases
mmps
have
attracted
attention
as
potential
biomarkers
since
these
enzymes
help
promote
the
growth
and
spread
of
tumors
by
chewing
up
the
tissue
scaffolds
that
normally
keep
cells
in

many
cancer
types
including
colon
tumours
produce
high
levels
of

for

is
in

within

an

of
the
chemical

only
the
urine
from
mice
with
colon
tumors
had
a
strong
blue
color
by
contrast
urine
from
the
healthy
control
mice
exhibited
no
color
change
the
team
also
designed
the
aunc
surfaces
to
go
unseen
by
the
immune
system
to
prevent
immune
reactions
or
toxic
side
effects
and
to
prevent
abundant
serum
proteins
from
sticking
to
them
which
would
make
the
nanosensors
too
large
to
be
filtered
by
the
kidneys
during
a
four-week
follow
up
after
nanosensor
administration
the
mice
showed
no
signs
of
side
effects
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
protein-sensor
complex
or
free
auncs
lingered
in
the

of

said
the
auncs
are
similar
to
materials
already
used
in
the
clinic
for
imaging
tumors
but
here
we
are
taking
advantage
of
their
unique
properties
to
give
us
additional
information
about
disease
however
there's
still
a
lot
of
optimization
and
testing
needed
before
the
technology
can
move
beyond
the
lab
accessible
diagnosticsnext
the
team
will
work
to
increase
the
specificity
and
sensitivity
of
the
sensors
by
testing
them
in
additional
animal
models
to
investigate
diagnostic

by

that

the

are
now
working
