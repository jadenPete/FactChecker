new

into
how

mars
lost

a
key
tracer
used
to
estimate
how
much
atmosphere
mars
lost
can
change
depending
on
the
time
of
day
and
the
surface
temperature
on
the
red
planet
according
to
new
observations
by
nasa-funded
scientists
previous
measurements
of
this
tracer
isotopes
of
oxygen
have
disagreed
significantly
an
accurate
measurement
of
this
tracer
is
important
to
estimate
how
much
atmosphere
mars
once
had
before
it
was
lost
which
reveals
whether
mars
could
have
been
habitable
and
what
the
conditions
might
have
been
like
mars
is
a
cold
inhospitable
desert
today
but
features
like
dry
riverbeds
and
minerals
that
only
form
with
liquid
water
indicate
that
long
ago
it
had
a
thick
atmosphere
that
retained
enough
heat
for
liquid
water
a
necessary
ingredient
for
life
to
flow
on
the
surface
it
appears
that
mars
lost
much
of
its
atmosphere
over
billions
of
years
transforming
its
climate
from
one
that
might
have
supported
life
into
the
desiccated
and
frozen
environment
of
today
according
to
results
from
nasa
missions
such
as
maven
and
curiosity
and
going
back
to
the
viking
missions
of
however
many
mysteries
about
the
red
planet's
ancient
atmosphere
remain
we
know
mars
had
more
atmosphere
we
know
it
had
flowing
water
we
do
not
have
a
good
estimate
for
the
conditions
apart
from
that
how
earthlike
was
the
mars
environment
for
how
long

on
this
research
published
online
in
icarus
august
one
way
to
estimate
how
thick
the
original
atmosphere
of
mars
was
is
to
look
at
isotopes
of
oxygen
isotopes
are
versions
of
an
element
with
different
mass
due
to
the
number
of
neutrons
in
the
atomic
nucleus
lighter
isotopes
escape
to
space
faster
than
heavier
isotopes
so
the
atmosphere
that
remains
on
the
planet
gets
gradually
enriched
in
the
heavier
isotope
in
this
case
mars
is
enriched
compared
to
earth
in
the
heavier
isotope
of
oxygen
o
versus
the
lighter
and
much
more
common
o.
the
measured
relative
amount
of
each
isotope
can
be
used
to
estimate
how
much
more
atmosphere
there
was
on
ancient
mars
in
combination
with
an
estimate
for
how
much
faster
the
lighter
o
escapes
and
assuming
that
the
relative
amount
of
each
isotope
on
earth
and
mars
was
once
similar
the
problem
is
that
measurements
of
the
amount
of
o
compared
to
o
on
mars
the
o
o
ratio
have
not
been
consistent
different
missions
measured
different
ratios
which
results
in
different
understandings
of
the
ancient
martian
atmosphere
the
new
result
provides
a
possible
way
to
resolve
this
discrepancy
by
showing
that
the
ratio
can
change
during
the
martian
day
previous
measurements
on
mars
or
from
earth
have
obtained
a
variety
of
different
values
for
the
isotope
ratio
said
livengood
ours
are
the
first
measurements
to
use
a
single
method
in
a
way
that
shows
the
ratio
actually
varying
within
a
single
day
rather
than
comparisons
between
independent
devices
in
our
measurements
the
isotope
ratio
varies
from
being
about
depleted
in
heavy
isotopes
at
noon
on
mars
to
being
about
enriched
in
heavy
isotopes
by
about
pm
compared
to
the
isotope
ratios
that
are
normal
for
earth
oxygen
this
range
of
isotope
ratios
is
consistent
with
the
other
reported
measurements
our
measurements
suggest
that
the
previous
work
all
may
have
been
done
correctly
but
disagreed
because
this
aspect
of
the
atmosphere
is
more
complex
than
we
had
realized
said
livengood
depending
where
on
mars
the
measurement
was
made
and
what
time
of
day
on
mars
it
is
possible
to
get
different
values
the
team
thinks
the
change
in
ratios
during
the
day
is
a
routine
occurrence
due
to
ground
temperature
in
which
the
isotopically
heavier
molecules
would
stick
to
cold
surface
grains
at
night
more
than
the
lighter
isotopes
then
are
freed
thermally
desorb
as
the
surface
warms
up
during
the
day
since
the
martian
atmosphere
is
mostly
carbon
dioxide
co
what
the
team
actually
observed
were
oxygen
isotopes
attached
to
carbon
atoms
in
the
co
molecule
they
made
their
observations
of
the
martian
atmosphere
with
the
nasa
infrared
telescope
facility
on
mauna
kea
hawaii
using
the
heterodyne
instrument
for
planetary
winds
and
composition
developed
at
nasa
goddard
while
trying
to
understand
the
broad
spread
in
estimated
isotope
ratios
that
we
retrieved
from
the
observations
we
noticed
that
they
were
correlated
with
the
surface
temperature
that
we
also
obtained
said
livengood
that
was
the
insight
that
set
us
on
this
path
the
new
work
will
help
researchers
refine
their
estimates
of
the
ancient
martian
atmosphere
because
the
measurements
can
now
be
understood
to
be
consistent
with
the
results
of
such
processes
in
other
planets
atmospheres
it
means
they
are
on
the
right
track
for
understanding
how
the
martian
climate
changed
it
shows
that
the
atmospheric
loss
was
by
processes
that
we
more
or
less
understand
said
livengood
critical
details
remain
to
be
worked
out
but
it
means
that
we
don't
need
to
invoke
exotic
processes
that
could
have
resulted
in
removing
co
without
changing
the
isotope
ratios
or
changing
just
some
ratios
in
other
elements
