the

vice

mike
pence's
chief
of
staff
marc
short
told
cbs
news
on
monday
the
measure
comes
less
than
two
months
after
attorney
general
william
barr
directed
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
to
resume
capital
punishment
something
it
hadn't
done
since
barr
reportedly
worked
with
pence's
policy
team
to
draft
the
legislation
and
it'll
likely
be
included
in
a
white
house
package
of
gun
safety
proposals
that
go
to
congress
president
donald
trump
said
earlier
this
month
that
he
wanted
mass
murderers
to
face
the
death
penalty
quickly
and
decisively
and
without
years
of
delay
he
was
reacting
to
shootings
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
which
together
left
more
than
people
dead
meanwhile
u.s.
attorneys
are
seeking
the
death
penalty
for
the
el
paso
shooter
on
federal
hate
crime
and
weapons
charges
earlier
this
month
democrats
urged
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
to
push
senators
to
vote
on
house-passed
universal
gun
background
checks
legislation
mcconnell
previously
refused
to
bring
the
legislation
to
the
floor
trump's
stance
on
gun
control
has
varied
widely
over
the
years
after
saying
there
was
a
very
strong
appetite
for
background
checks
in
the
wake
of
the
dayton
and
el
paso
shootings
he
backtracked
casting
doubt
on
their
effectiveness
against
gun
violence
and
instead
blaming
mass
shootings
on
mental
illness
trump
told
reporters
on
sunday
if
you
look
at
the
last
four
or
five
going
back
even
five
or
six
or
seven
years
for
the
most
part
as
strong
as
you
make
your
background
checks
they
would
not
have
stopped
any
of
it
so
it's
a
big
problem
it's
a
mental
problem
it's
a
