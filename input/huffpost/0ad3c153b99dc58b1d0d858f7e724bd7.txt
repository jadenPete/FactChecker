the

one
critic
snapped
back
president
donald
trump's

head-banging

served
as
sweet
inspiration
for

he
declared
in
a
tweet
that
the
media
is
destroying
the
free
press
trump
apparently
took
time
out
from
concentrating
on
the
g-
summit
to
watch
right-wing
radio
and
fox
news
host
mark
levin
bash
the

and
plug
