indiana
can't
kick
voters
off
rolls
without
warning
appeals
court
says
the
only

know
whether

th
circuit
chief
judge
diane
wood
wrote
a
u.s.
appeals
court
rebuked
a
new
indiana
law
that
sought
to
aggressively
cancel
voter
registrations
agreeing
with
a
lower
court
ruling
that
blocked
the
law
last
year
the
indiana
law
passed
in
allowed
election
officials
to
cancel
a
voter's
registration
without
first
getting
confirmation
from
the
voter
the
officials
could
instead
use
interstate
crosscheck
a
database
of
voters
from
two
dozen
states
to
see
if
the
person
was
registered
in
another
state
even
though
there
is
evidence
the
crosscheck
database
is
unreliable
the
indiana
election
officials
could
cancel
the
voter's
registration
if
they
found
a
registration
matched
that
of
a
voter
in
another
state
a
federal
law
called
the
national
voter
registration
act
nvra
sets
out
specific
conditions
under
which
a
state
may
remove
voters
from
its
rolls
those
conditions
include
if
someone
requests
to
be
removed
the
law
also
requires
states
to
implement
a
non-discriminatory
program
that
makes
a
reasonable
effort
to
remove
people
from
the
rolls
who
have
died
or
moved
last
year
a
federal
judge
blocked
the
indiana
measure
saying
it
appeared
to
run
afoul
of
that
federal
law
on
tuesday
a
three-judge
panel
for
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
th
circuit
agreed
with
that
finding
diane
wood
the
circuit's
chief
judge
authored
the
opinion
and
was
unsparing
in
her
criticism
of
the
indiana
law
she
dismissed
the
argument
from
indiana's
lawyers
that
the
procedure
was
permissible
because
the
matching
voter
registration
in
another
state
amounted
to
a
request
to
be
removed
from
the
rolls
wood
noted
that
someone
might
move
from
indiana
register
in
another
state
but
then
have
personal
circumstances
change
and
move
back
to
indiana
before
election
day
she
noted
there
was
a
distinction
between
voting
twice
which
is
illegal
and
being
registered
twice
which
is
not
especially
in
states
that
have
an
early
registration
deadline
it
may
be
perfectly
rational
for
a
voter
to
register
in
a
new
location
before
getting
around
to
canceling
the
old
indiana
registration
selling
an
indiana
house
or
severing
other
formal
connections
with
indiana
she
said
the
only
way
to
know
whether
voters
want
to
cancel

registration
is
to

chief

diane
wood
the
ruling
comes
as
voter
cancellations
sometimes
called
voter
purging
emerge
as
a
major
voting
rights
battle
last
year
the
u.s.
supreme
court
approved
an
aggressive
voter
removal
process
in
ohio
at
least
million
people
nationwide
have
had
their
voter
registrations
canceled
since
the
election
according
to
an
analysis
by
the
brennan
center
for
justice
it's
not
clear
how
many
of
those
cancelations
were
legitimate
a
name
on
a
voter
roll
in
indiana
is
there
only
because
a
voter
took
the
trouble
to
put
it
there
laws
such
as
the
nvra
ensure
that
the
states
do
not
undo
that
work
without
good
reason
wood
wrote
in
her
opinion
the
lawsuit
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
indiana
chapters
of
three
civil
rights
groups
the
naacp
the
league
of
women
voters
and
common
cause
we
are
extremely
pleased
with
this
decision
since
it
means
that
indiana
counties
will
have
to
follow
federal
law
when
maintaining
their
lists
of
registered
voters
and
no
hoosier
will
be
removed
from
the
list
without
proper
notice
and
a
waiting
period
said
julia
vaughn
policy
director
of
indiana
common
cause
those
safeguards
are
in
the
law
for
a
reason
and
it
is
reassuring
to
know
that
hoosier
voters
will
be
protected
from
unlawful
