rushed
to
prepare
for
the
oncoming
storm
the
president
took
time
to
tweet
insults
at
them
while
puerto
ricans
were
bracing
for
the
intensifying
hurricane
dorian
their
president
was
firing
off
tweets
about
corruption
on
the
island
and
bragging
about
being
the
best
thing
that's
ever
happened
to
puerto
rico
on
wednesday
locals
scrambled
to
prepare
for
the
storm
barreling
toward
their
coastline
bringing
damaging
winds
torrential
rain
flash
flooding
storm
surge
and
mudslides
meanwhile
president
donald
trump
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
string
of
unhelpful
tweets
demonstrating
a
complete
lack
of
sensitivity
toward
american
citizens
facing
and
still
recovering
from
a
crisis
we
are
tracking
closely
tropical
storm
dorian
as
it
heads
as
usual
to
puerto
rico
fema
and
all
others
are
ready
and
will
do
a
great
job
when
they
do
let
them
know
it
and
give
them
a
big
thank
you
not
like
last
time
that
includes
from
the
incompetent
mayor
of
san

donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
puerto
rico
is
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
their
political
system
is
broken
and
their
politicians
are
either
incompetent
or
corrupt
congress
approved
billions
of
dollars
last
time
more
than
anyplace
else
has
ever
gotten
and
it
is
sent

august
and
by
the
way
he
added
i'm
the
best
thing
that's

was
last
hit
by
a
major
storm
the
category
hurricane
maria
in
nearly
people
died
from
the
disaster
before
during
and
afterward
the
president
absolved
himself
of
blame
and
denied
the
accuracy
of
the
numbers
tweeting
that
people
did
not
die
and
that
when
he'd
left
the
island
after
the
storm
they
had
anywhere
from
to
deaths
the
previous
official
death
toll
of
was
revised
to
in
after
research
found
that
thousands
had
died
due
to
the
hurricane's
aftereffects
according
to
cnn
trump
also
praised
his
handling
of
the
hurricane
as
an
incredible
unsung
success
dorian
hit
less
than
a
month
before
the
two-year
anniversary
of
hurricane
maria
from
which
many
puerto
ricans
are
still
recovering
while
fema
and
san
juan
mayor
carmen
yul
n
cruz
were
working
together
to
coordinate
assistance
cruz
denounced
the
president's
tweets
i
said
yesterday
that
trump
needs
to
be
quiet
calm
down
get
out
of
the

and
make
way
for
those
of
us
who
are
actually
doing
the
work
on
the
ground
she
tweeted
maybe
trump
will
understand
this
time
around
this
is
not
about
him
this
is
not
about
politics
this
is
about
saving
