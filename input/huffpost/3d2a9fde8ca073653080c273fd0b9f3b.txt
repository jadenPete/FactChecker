cnn
panelist
nails
why
trump
treated
puerto
rico
differently
brown
skin
political
commentator
maria
cardona
posited
that
trump
seems
to
care
more
about
dorian
hitting
florida
than
puerto
rico
because
of
race
and
electoral
votes
cnn
political
commentators
maria
cardona
and
scott
jennings
parried
on
thursday
night
over
president
donald
trump's
marked
change
in
tone
about
hurricane
dorian
now
that
the
storm
threatens
florida
instead
of
puerto
rico
what
is
the
difference
scott
the
difference
is
that
puerto
rico
most
of
the
people
there
speak
spanish
have
brown
skin
are
hispanic
and
they
have
zero
electoral
votes
cardona
said
on
the
erin
burnett
out
front
segment
earlier
this
week
trump
trashed
puerto
rico
on
twitter
as
the
island
braced
for
what
was
predicted
then
to
be
a
hit
by
dorian
puerto
rico
is
one
of
the
most
corrupt
places
on
earth
their
political
system
is
broken
and
their
politicians
are
either
incompetent
or
corrupt
congress
approved
billions
of
dollars
last
time
more
than
anyplace
else
has
ever
gotten
and
it
is
sent
to
crooked
pols
no
good

wow
yet
another
big
storm
heading
to
puerto
rico
will
it
ever
end
congress
approved
billion
dollars
for
puerto
rico
last
year
an
all
time
record
of
its
kind
for
anywhere
donald

trump
realdonaldtrump
august
and
by
the
way
i'm
the
best
thing
that's
ever
happened
to
puerto

donald

trump

august
the
storm
grazed
puerto
rico
on
wednesday
then
veered
with
intensifying
throttle
toward
the
u.s.
east
coast
on
thursday
the
president
announced
that
he
was
canceling
a
planned
trip
to
poland
in
order
to
monitor
the
hurricane
which
is
forecast
by
the
national
hurricane
center
to
make
landfall
in
florida
this
weekend
or
early
next
week
as
a
category
it's
looking
like
it
could
be
an
absolute
monster
we're
ready
the
president
said
in
a
video
from
the
white
house
rose
garden
when
asked
by
cnn
guest-host
jim
sciutto
to
provide
an
explanation
for
the
president's
change
jennings
answer
was
that
the
president
has
well-known
problems
with
the
way
puerto
rico
is
managed
and
any
objective
observer
would
argue
that
florida
is
a
much
better-managed
piece
of
land
as
the
storm
was
barreling
down
scott
is
it
acceptable
for
a
u.s.
president
to
talk
about
it
in
those
terms
sciutto
replied
jennings
acknowledged
the
president
should
treat
all
american
citizens
in
all
states
and
territories
the
same
but
disputed
cardona's
argument
it's
a
hurricane
it
is
an
emergency
situation
florida
gets
hit
with
hurricanes
all
the
time
and
so
if
your
argument
is
the
president
should
turn
a
blind
eye
towards
this
i
don't
even
know
what
to
say
to
that
cardona
responded
that
jennings
was
making
her
point
for
her
yes
he
should
respond
to
every
hurricane
and
natural
disaster
where
people's
lives
are
in
the
path
of
that
disaster
the
way
that
he
is
responding
to
florida
he
did
not
do
it
to
puerto
rico
she
added
if
there's
any
other
reason
that
you
can
think
of
as
to
why
the
president
treats
the
million
american
citizens
in
puerto
rico
differently
and
don't
tell
me
it's
because
of
the
corruption

the
leaders
