fatal
arrest
new
york
mayor
and
presidential
contender
bill
de
blasio
was
heckled
by
a
protester
during
a
sunday
night
town
hall
on
cnn
over
his
city's
handling
of
eric
garner's
fatal
arrest
garner
died
in
staten
island
in
after
nypd
officer
daniel
pantaleo
put
him
in
a
banned
chokehold
garner's
death
galvanized
the
black
lives
matter
movement
which
adopted
the
man's
dying
words
i
can't
breathe
as
a
rallying
cry
the
nypd
announced
last
week
more
than
five
years
after
garner's
death
that
it
had
fired
pantaleo
and
reprimanded
his
supervisor
sgt
kizzy
adonis
for
her
role
in
the
deadly
incident
adonis
who
pleaded
guilty
to
multiple
departmental
charges
of
failure
to
supervise
will
keep
her
job
the
nypd
said
but
loses
of
her
vacation
days
garner's
mother
gwen
carr
said
she
was
furious
that
adonis
had
only
received
a
slap
on
the
wrist
and
that
no
other
officers
had
been
punished
for
wrongdoing
even
though
more
than
a
dozen
of
them
had
been
involved
in
her
son's
arrest
i
am
outraged
and
disgusted
by
how
the
de
blasio
administration
and
the
nypd
continue
to
show
that
they
don't
care
about
the
murder
of
my
son
or
black
lives
carr
said
in
a
statement
asked
during
the
cnn
town
hall
about
garner's
death
and
the
city's
handling
of
the
case
de
blasio
said
the
man
should
not
have
died
and
that
there
can
never
be
another
eric
garner
in
this
city
or
any
place
else
in
this
country
what
we
learned
immediately
after
the
tragedy
of
eric
garner
was
we
had
to
do
pretty
much
everything
differently
de
blasio
said
stressing
a
need
for
federal
leadership
that
will
mandate
de-escalation
training
implicit
bias
training
and
body
cameras
for
every
police
officer
in
america
that's
how
we
end
the
tragedies
the
mayor
said
he
went
on
to
blame
the
federal
government
for
the
protracted
process
that
led
to
pantaleo's
firing
the
united
states
department
of
justice
failed
here
miserably
de
blasio
said
the
doj
went
five
years
without
even
deciding
they
were
going
to
act
and
telling
the
city
of
new
york
not
to
act
he
continued
i
think
we
need
a
law
in
this
country
federal
law
that
says
in
these
dynamics
there
has
to
be
a
mandate
that
the
justice
department
must
act
it
could
be
one
year
two
years
whatever
standard
we
set
they
must
make
a
decision
they
must
act
moments
later
a
woman
in
the
audience
identified
by
new
york
daily
news
as
a
member
of
the
protest
group
justice
league
nyc
shouted
at
the
mayor
what
about
lieutenant
christopher
bannon
what
about
officer
mark
ramos
what
about
other
officers
she
yelled
referring
to
officers
also
on
the
scene
of
garner's
arrest
de
blasio
didn't
look
in
the
direction
of
the
woman
or
acknowledge
her
questions
please
be
respectful
moderator
ana
cabrera
told
the
protester
we
have
more
audience
questions
to
get
to
the
daily
news
said
the
woman
was
then
escorted
out
of
the
studio
the
first
thing
to
say
is
eric
garner
should
not
have
died
and
then
the
next
thing
to
say
is
there
can
never
be
another
eric
garner
in
this
city
or
any
place
else
in
this
country
new

mayor
bill

august
during
cnn's
july
democratic
debate
de
blasio
was
also
heckled
by
protesters
over
the
garner
debacle
demonstrators
repeatedly
chanted
fire
pantaleo
during
de
blasio's
opening
statements
he
later
vowed
that
garner's
family
would
get
justice
i
have
confidence
in
that
de
blasio
has
said
in
the
past
that
he
doesn't
have
the
legal
authority
to
fire
pantaleo
but
he's
also
been
criticized
for
repeatedly
failing
to
take
action
in
other
ways
including
delaying
the
launch
of
formal
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
cop
following
the
officer's
firing
last
week
a
spokeswoman
for
the
mayor
said
people
were
being
held
accountable
and
there
is
finally
some
measure
of
justice
in
the
garner
case
we
hope
that
this
brings
the
garner
family
some
small
measure
of
peace
the
statement
said
but
garner's
mom
said
the
disciplinary
actions
had
been
woefully
inadequate
it's
disgraceful
that
they
waited
more
than
five
years
until
after
pantaleo
was
fired
to
cut
adonis
a
deal
so
that
all
she's
facing
is
losing
some
vacation
days
and
they
want
us
to
accept
these
crumbs
as
if
there
is
some
justice
carr
said
by
refusing
to
schedule
a
disciplinary
trial
for
adonis
de
blasio
and
the
nypd
are
actively
participating
in
an
ongoing
cover-up
because
they
don't
want
the
public
to
know
how
deep
how
wide
and
how
high
the
wrongdoing
in

case
