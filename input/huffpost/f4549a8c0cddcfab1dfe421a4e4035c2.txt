which
had
been
classified
as
measles-free
by
the
world
health
organization

of
johnson's

the
pressure
from
the
british
government
comes
as
lawmakers
in
the
u.s.
are
also
calling
for
social
media
companies
to
take
responsibility
for
vaccine
misinformation
spreading
on
their
platforms
the
number
of
measles
cases
in
the
u.s.
in
has
surpassed
which
federal
health
officials
said
is
the
worst
outbreak
of
the
disease
in
years
in
february
rep
adam
schiff
d-calif
wrote
to
facebook
ceo
mark
zuckerberg
expressing
concern
that
instagram
and
facebook
were
surfacing
and
recommending
messages
that
discourage
parents
from
vaccinating
their
children
schiff
cited
a
guardian
report
that
suggested
searches
on
facebook
and
youtube
often
led
users
to
pages
that
displayed
vaccine
misinformation
a
month
later
facebook
said
it
would
work
to
tackle
vaccine
misinformation
by
lowering
the
ranking
of
groups
and
pages
that
spread
such
lies
on
people's
news
feed
the
platform
also
said
it
would
reject
ads
that
include
anti-vaccine
information
and
will
not
display
or
recommend
vaccine
misinformation
on
search
and
hashtag
pages
on
instagram
one
of
its
properties
that
decision
came
after
pinterest
said
it
would
block
results
for
searches
related
to
vaccines
youtube
also
said
it
would
demonetize
anti-vax
videos
after
a
february
report
from
buzzfeed
but
some
vaccine
misinformation
still
manages
to
spread
online
technically
companies
like
facebook
and
twitter
don't
have
specific
policies
against
general
misinformation
so
anti-vaccine
propaganda
on
personal
accounts
would
not
violate
any
rules
but
twitter
has
said
that
users
in
the
u.s.
and
the
u.k.
who
search
for
vaccine
information
will
first
get
a
government
information
site
from
their
respective
countries
there
were
more
reports
of
measles
cases
worldwide
in
the
first
half
of
than
in
any
year
since
with
outbreaks
straining
health
care
systems
and
leading
to
serious
illness
disability
and
deaths
according
to
recent
data
from
who
the
organization
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
people
not
being
vaccinated
included
misinformation
measles
is
almost
entirely
preventable
with
two
doses
of
the
vaccine
according
to
who
a
country
needs
of
its
population
to
receive
both
vaccination
doses
to
ensure
that
measles
doesn't
spread
johnson's
call
for
a
summit
of
social
media
companies
is
not
the
first
time
the
british
government
has
clashed
with
online
platforms
in
february
british
lawmakers
released
a
report
accusing
facebook
of
intentionally
and
knowingly
violating
the
u.k.
s
data
privacy
and
competition
laws
that
report
which
studied
social
media's
role
in
peddling
misinformation
and
interfering
in

called
on
lawmakers
to
create
regulations
to
hold
