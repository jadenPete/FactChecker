fuck
but
trump
was
told
by
the
person
who
briefed
him
about
the
hurricane
that
they
would
look
into
it
one

report
in
a
tweet

calling
the

ridiculous
and
just
more
fake
news
the
story
by
axios
that
president
trump
wanted
to
blow
up
large
hurricanes
with

is
ridiculous
i
never
said

not
only
would
a
nuke
not
necessarily
alter
the
path
of
a
hurricane
the
released
radioactive
fallout
would
cause
devastating
environmental
problems
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
warned
needless
to
say
this
is
not
a
good
idea
the

which
maintains
a

how
spectacularly
bad
a

it
is
