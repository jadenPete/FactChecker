trump
backpedals
on
tougher
gun
background
checks
warning
of
slippery
slope
the
president
parroted
the
refrain
from
critics
who
oppose
enhanced
scrutiny
of
firearm
purchases
president
donald
trump
moved
further
away
from
supporting
expanded
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
on
tuesday
touting
the
popular
narrative
of
critics
who
claim
such
new
rules
will
somehow
lead
to
the
total
erosion
of
the
constitutional
right
to
bear
arms
the
democrats
would
i
believe
i
think
they'd
give
up
the
second
amendment
he
told
reporters
during
an
oval
office
press
conference
a
lot
of
the
people
that
put
me
where
i
am
are
strong
believers
in
the
second
amendment
and
i
am
also
and
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
that
you
know
they
call
it
the
slippery
slope
and
all
of
a
sudden
everything
gets
taken
away
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen
democratic
congressional
leaders
repeatedly
have
stressed
that
they
do
not
want
to
get
rid
of
the
second
amendment
but
time
and
again
they
have
called
for
tighter
and
more
expansive
regulations
on
gun
sales
the
current
system
does
not
cover
all
purchases
earlier
this
month
in
the
wake
of
two
mass
shootings
one
in
el
paso
texas
where
a
white
supremacist
is
charged
in
the
slaughter
of
people
and
another
in
dayton
ohio
where
a
gunman
killed
people
trump
pointed
to
a
very
strong
appetite
for
background
checks
like
we've
never
had
before
he
teased
that
a
really
really
good
deal
could
be
reached
on
the
issue
in
congress
calling
background
checks
important
the
president
said
i
don't
want
to
put
guns
into
the
hands
of
mentally
unstable
people
or
people
with
rage
or
hate
sick
people
i
don't
want
to
i'm
all
in
favor
of
it
a
presidential
push
for
enhanced
checks
is
viewed
by
most
analysts
as
essential
to
the
passage
of
any
such
legislation
given
traditional
opposition
to
the
measures
by
republicans
and
the
political
clout
wielded
against
the
proposals
by
the
national
rifle
association
but
as
the
shock
caused
by
the
recent
shooting
have
worn
off
so
has
trump's
interest
in
the
issue
his
latest
remarks
indicate
that
he
has
no
serious
intention
of
making
tougher
background
checks
a
priority
we
have
very
very
strong
background
checks
right
now
he
said
tuesday
but
we
have
sort
of
missing
areas
and
areas
that
don't
complete
the
whole
circle
and
we're
looking
at
different
things
trump
then
steered
the
conversation
back
to
mental
health
a
common
gop
talking
point
when
it
comes
to
gun
control
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
is
a
mental
problem
and
i've
said
it
a
hundred
times
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
person
that
pulls
the
trigger
these
are
sick
people
and
it
is
also
that
kind
of
a
problem
the
atlantic
reported
that
trump
in
a
tuesday
phone
conversation
told
embattled
nra
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
that
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
on
monday
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
slammed
the
president's
apparent
retreat
on
stricter
gun
control
measures
calling
his
initial
remarks
meaningless
we've
seen
this
movie
before
president
trump
feeling
public
pressure
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
a
horrible
shooting
talks
about
doing
something
meaningful
to
address
gun
violence
but
inevitably
he
backtracks
in
response
to
pressure
from
the
nra
and
the
hard-right
schumer
said
these
retreats
from
president
trump
are
not
only
disappointing
but
also
heartbreaking
particularly
for
the
families
of
the
victims
of
gun
violence
though
schumer
and
other
democrats
have
called
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
to
reconvene
the
chamber
so
that
it
can
consider
gun
legislation
he
