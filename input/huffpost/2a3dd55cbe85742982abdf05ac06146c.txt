democratic

votes
down
climate
debate
activists
vow
to
fight
on
the
vote
came
a
day
after
the
climate
candidate
jay
inslee
who
had
been
pushing
for
the
debate
dropped
out
of
the
race
a
panel
of
the
democratic
national
committee
on
thursday
rejected
a
proposal
to
host
a
single-issue
debate
on
the
climate
crisis
at
a
party
conference
thursday
in
san
francisco
the
dnc's
resolutions
committee
voted
against
a
resolution
that
has
become
a
cause
c
l
bre
for
activists
and
for
more
than
a
dozen
presidential
contenders
who
felt
the
traditional
debate
format
failed
to
adequately
address
the
looming
threat
of
catastrophe
the
issue
could
resurface
during
the
full
committee's
general
session
on
saturday
it
was
a
predictable
outcome
top
brass
at
the
dnc
opposed
the
climate
debate
from
the
get-go
fearing
it
could
sow
discord
in
the
base
and
hamper
the
eventual
nominee
in
the
general
election
cnn
and
msnbc
announced
plans
last
month
to
host
forums
on
climate
change
in
september
dnc
chair
tom
perez
affirmed
the
forums
in
a
resolution
introduced
earlier
this
month
which
some
activists
saw
as
setting
the
stage
for
voting
down
the
climate
debate
symone
sanders
a
senior
adviser
of
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
was
among
those
who
urged
the
dnc
on
thursday
to
vote
down
a
climate
debate
saying
it
would
be
dangerous
territory
in
the
middle
of
a
democratic
primary
process
that
contrasts
with
what
biden
had
earlier
said
during
a
campaign
stop
in
iowa
this
summer
the
former
vice
president
had
endorsed
having
a
climate
debate
telling
greenpeace
i'm
all
in
the
influential
youth-led
climate
group
sunrise
movement
a
driving
force
behind
the
climate
debate
push
filled
the
room
where
the
vote
took
place
with
as
many
as
activists
on
thursday
we
deserve
a
chance
at
a
livable
future
one
sunrise
activist
shouted
after
the
vote
we
deserve
a
climate
debate
the
nonprofit
vowed
to
hold
protests
over
the
next
day
intended
to
shame
the
dnc
for
voting
down
the
measure
at
the
same
time
it
applauded
the
committee's
vote
to
advance
a
resolution
reversing
a
ban
on
candidates
participating
alongside
one
another
at
climate
forums
not
sanctioned
by
the
dnc
this
partial
victory
shows
the
strength
of
the
grassroots
movement
and
the
power
of
young
people
sunrise
movement
spokesperson
sofie
karasek
said
in
a
statement
in
the
coming
days
and
months
we'll
keep
fighting
to
make
sure
the
dnc
and
tom
perez
treat
the
climate
crisis
like
the
emergency
that
it
is
and
give
it
the
airtime
and
attention
that
it
deserves
adding
to
the
string

departure
from

who
pegged
his
entire
candidacy
to
a
sweeping

out

holds
up
a
sign
outside
the
dnc
headquarters
climate
change
was
virtually
ignored
in
the
presidential
election
a
symptom
as
much
of
the
widespread
denial
of
the
scope
of
the
threat
as
the
lack
of
popular
policy
ideas
to
curb
emissions
that
changed
over
the
past
year
in
october
the
united
nations
issued
a
dire
report
that
projected
warming
beyond
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
roughly
half-a-degree
hotter
than
average
temperatures
today
and
widely
considered
the
brink
of
a
safe
climate
unless
global
emissions
are
roughly
halved
in
the
next
decade
the
findings
electrified
the
climate
movement
internationally
in
the
united
states
as
democrats
celebrated
a
new
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
after
the
november
midterm
elections
youth
activists
with
sunrise
movement
occupied
incoming
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi's
office
demanding
the
party
make
sweeping
climate
policy
a
priority
the
protests
fueled
a
nascent
movement
for
a
green
new
deal
an
unprecedented
plan
to
eliminate
emissions
and
provide
millions
of
high-wage
jobs
to
workers
in
industries
that
need
to
be
phased
out
as
the
election
cycle
shifted
to
the
presidential
primary
the
green
new
deal
became
the
animating
force
behind
the
proposals
candidates
began
releasing
but
only
some
plans
offered
firm
details
other
top-tier
candidates
neglected
to
put
out
climate
plans
at
all
given
the
single-digit
airtime
devoted
to
climate
change
in
the
debates
the
fight
turned
to
demanding
a
televised
candidate
event
on
climate
change
alone
inslee
championed
the
cause
and
he
rallied
more
than
a
dozen
candidates
behind
him
including

elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
former
vice
president
joe
biden
a
poll
in
june
found
of
democratic-leaning
voters
supported
the
idea
perez
took
a
firm
stance
against
the
debate
arguing
it
would
unfairly
favor
inslee's
campaign
the
dnc
has
said
it
would
open
the
gate
to
a
flood
of
requests
for
single-issue
debates
on
abortion
rights
health
care
and
other
hot-button
issues
but
some
speculated
that
the
dnc
was
mostly
worried
that
a
debate
that
incentivized
the
eventual
nominee
to
declare
war
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
risked
ceding
gas-producing
states
like
pennsylvania
to
trump
