ignoring

even
some

oppose
the

plan

president
donald
trump's
administration
on
thursday
reportedly
plans
to
roll
back
regulation
of
methane
emissions
by
the
oil
and
gas
industry
a
major
contributor
to
climate
change
the
proposed
rule
change
reflects
the
trump
administration
view
that
the
government
overstepped
its
authority
with
mandates
during
the
obama
administration
that
oil
and
gas
companies
take
steps
to
repair
methane
leaks
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
which
first
reported
the
rollback
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
to
get
to
the
fundamental
basis
of
whether
methane
should
have
been
regulated
in
the
first
place
anne
idsal
the
acting
assistant
administrator
for
the
environmental
protection
agency's
office
of
air
and

told
the
journal
it's
not
about
whether
we're
doing
the
maximum
we
can
or
should
do
to
deal
with
climate
change

idsal
added
that
she
doesn't
believe
that
there's
going
to
be
some
big
climate
concern
here
many
others
including
some
oil

companies
would
disagree
this
is
extraordinarily
harmful
rachel

the
united

special
representative

told
the
new

just
at
a
time
when
the
federal
government's
job
should
be
to
help
localities
and
states
move
faster
toward
cleaner
energy
and
a
cleaner

just

of

those
aimed

kassie
siegel
director
of
the
climate
law
institute
at
the
center
for

slammed
the
methane
rollback
as
reckless
and
evidence
of
complete
contempt
for
our
climate
by
trump
and
his
administration
the
epa
is
now
so
determined
to
actually
increase
greenhouse
pollution
that
it's
even
shrugging
off
concerns
from
oil
and
gas
companies
about
gutting
these
protections
siegel
told
the
washington
post
fracked
gas
is
a
climate
killer
and
trump's
rash
embrace
of
this
dirty
stuff
showcases
the
need
