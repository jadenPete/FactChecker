children
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
and
other
attorneys
general
are
suing
the
trump
administration
over
its
action
on
the
flores
settlement
california
is
leading
a
nearly
state
lawsuit
challenging
the
trump
administration's
abandonment
of
a
long-standing
rule
governing
how
long
migrant
children
can
be
detained
state
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
and
gov
gavin
newsom
d
announced
the
suit
at
a
press
conference
on
monday
marking
nearly
the
th
time
california
has
taken
legal
action
against
the
trump
administration
we
are
ready
to
fight
for
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
becerra
said
joined
by
massachusetts
attorney
general
maura
healey
and
the
attorneys
general
of
other
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
the
lawsuit
challenges
new
rules
set
forth
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
last
week
that
effectively
undo
the
flores
settlement
the
settlement
agreement
was
established
in
after
a
class-action
lawsuit
involving
several
migrant
children
over
the
last
years
it
has
limited
the
amount
of
time
the
government
was
allowed
to
detain
an
immigrant
child
to
days
or
less
it
also
established
minimum
guidelines
for
safe
and
sanitary
conditions
in
detention
facilities
requiring
the
government
to
provide
children
with
basic
needs
like
food
water
and
medical
care
kevin
mcaleenan
the
acting
secretary
of
homeland
security
last
week
called
the
flores
settlement
a
key
gap
in
our
immigration
framework
arguing
that
the
rule
change
closes
a
legal
loophole
effectively
incentivizing
illegal
entry
the
rule
change
set
to
go
into
effect
in
about
days
would
allow
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
to
detain
families
indefinitely
after
transferring
them
from
border
custody
yet
again
president
trump
is
disregarding
basic
human
rights
and
using
helpless
immigrant
children
as
political
pawns
to
further
his
ideological
agenda
newsom
said
in
a
statement
on
monday
california
will
emphatically
assert
itself
to
protect
the
welfare
and
safety
of
all
children
regardless
of
where
they
come
from
or
the
color
of
their
skin
becerra
noted
that
some
children
in
border
patrol
custody
have
been
detained
without
sufficient
food
health
or
medical
care
and
deprived
of
basic
sanitary
goods
like
soap
and
toothbrushes
echoing
disturbing
reports
of
the
inhumane
conditions
at
many
border
facilities
children
don't
become
subhuman
simply
because
they
are
migrants
the
attorney
general
said
newsom
addressed
the
fact
that
a
number
of
undocumented
immigrants
including
children
have
died
while
in
the
custody
of
immigration
officials
calling
the
administration's
actions
perverse
and
unconscionable
becerra
also
announced
california
was
filing
a
preliminary
injunction
to
stop
trump
administration's
public
charge
rule
a
policy
that
will
likely
make
it
much
harder
for
immigrants
to
apply
for
a
green
card

earn
a
visa
