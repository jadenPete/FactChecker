trump
has
emergency
authority
to

the

that

could
legally
demand
that
private

cut
ties
with
china
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
asserted
on
sunday
that
president
donald
trump
has
the
power
to
order
private
american
companies
to
cease
doing
business
with
china
despite
questions
over
the
legality
of
such
a
demand
ultimately
he
does
have
authority
kudlow
told
cbs
face
the
nation
it's
an
emergency
economic
power
authority
so
in
theory
that
law
exists
but
that's
not
what
the
president
said
he's
asking
american
companies
to
take
a
look
take
a
fresh
look
at
frankly
moving
out
of
china
go
in
someplace
else
preferably
coming
home
to
america
white
house
economic
advisor
larry
kudlow
tells
margbrennan
the
president
does
have
authority
to
block
private
businesses
from
investing
in
china
but
he
added
he
is
not
intending
to
right
now
that
is
not
his
intention

in
a
series
of
tweets
on
friday
trump
declared
that
u.s.
companies
are
hereby
ordered
to
immediately
start
looking
for
an
alternative
to
china
including
bringing
your
companies
home
and
making
your
products
in
the
usa
however
is
is
unclear
whether
the
edict
if
enforced
would
withstand
potential
legal
challenges
trump
cited
the
international
emergency
economic
powers
act
of
which
according
to
the
congressional
research
service
gives
him
authority
to
regulate
a
variety
of
economic
transactions
following
a
declaration
of
national
emergency
however
he
must
first
consult
with
congress
declare
an
emergency
and
provide
an
explanation
for
the
action
overall
the
extent
of
trump's
power
under
the
act
has
been
debated
according
to
the
new
york
times
trade
and
international
law
experts
have
generally
concluded
that
the
president
could
punish
companies
for
working
in
china
but
ordering
them
back
to
the
u.s.
entirely
may
be
crossing
the
line
furthermore
kudlow
acknowledged
that
relocating
companies
would
take
years
saying
that's
why
there's
no
immediate
action
here
and
claiming
that
trump
just
put
that
out
there
maybe
the
way
it
was
phrased
was
a
little
tougher
than
usual
but
come
home
come
home
to
america
kudlow
continued
this
is
the
best
place
to
work
and
live
and
earn
and
invest
