here
are
all
the
ways
democrats
are
trying
to
get
trump's
tax
returns
the
deutsche
bank
case
suddenly
looks
promising
deutsche
bank
revealed
to
a
federal
court
this
week
that
it
may
have
copies
of
president
donald
trump's
tax
returns
that
it
could
hand
over
to
congressional
democrats
in
response
to
their
subpoena
whether
the
bank
obeys
the
subpoena
will
be
up
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
nd
circuit
and
possibly
the
supreme
court
trump
is
the
first
president
in
years
not
to
publicly
release
his
returns
which
contain
details
about
income
charitable
donations
and
how
much
he
has
paid
in
taxes
the
deutsche
bank
subpoena
is
just
one
of
several
ways
that
democrats
are
trying
to
force
some
accountability
and
though
it
hasn't
been
their
main
effort
it
might
be
the
most
promising
democrats
primary
strategy
for
obtaining
trump's
tax
returns
has
been
to
pursue
a
formal
request
by
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
for
six
years
of
the
president's
personal
and
business
returns
plus
information
about
any
related
audits
under
a
federal
law
that
gives
tax
committees
access
to
private
tax
information
or
at
least
it's
supposed
to
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
denied
that
request
in
may
becoming
the
first
treasury
secretary
known
to
have
refused
to
follow
the
law
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
specifically
as
a
way
to
make
sure
that
executive
branch
officials
aren't
corruptly
making
money
on
the
side
democrats
sued
in
july
and
the
case
could
take
many
months
to
resolve
what
democrats
are
doing
congressional
democrats
formally
asked
for
trump's
tax
returns
under
a
federal
disclosure
law
the
request
is
in
court
they
also
asked
for
tax
records
as
part
of
a
broader
subpoena
for
financial
information
from
deutsche
bank
new
york
democrats
passed
a
law
to
give
congressional
democrats
access
to
trump's
state
returns
california
democrats
passed
a
law
requiring
presidential
candidates
to
disclose
tax
returns
to
get
on
the
ballot
democrats
outside
washington
have
also
gotten
in
on
the
tax
return
effort
new
york
passed
a
law
this
year
that
would
allow
a
congressional
committee
to
ask
the
state
tax
commissioner
for
a
taxpayer's
state
returns
if
the
committee
has
already
made
such
a
request
under
the
federal
disclosure
law
state
returns
provide
some
of
the
same
information
that
appears
on
federal
returns
but
capitol
hill
democrats
have
seemed
uninterested
in
going
after
new
york
documents
and
their
ability
to
use
the
law
is
blocked
for
now
while
the
state
sorts
out
a
court
challenge
from
trump
also
this
year
california
lawmakers
approved
a
measure
that
would
require
presidential
candidates
to
disclose
their
tax
returns
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
the
state
even
before
trump's
lawyers
sued
legal
experts
said
the
law
looked
constitutionally
dubious
in
march
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
passed
legislation
requiring
presidential
candidates
to
disclose
years
of
tax
returns
but
the
bill
has
no
chance
of
becoming
law
with
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
running
the
upper
chamber
as
a
tool
of
the
president
the
house
intelligence
and
financial
services
committees
subpoenaed
deutsche
bank
and
several
other
financial
institutions
as
part
of
a
broader
money-laundering
probe
in
april
in
recent
years
deutsche
bank
has
been
one
of
the
only
major
banks
willing
to
lend
trump
money
as
he's
known
for
failing
to
pay
his
creditors
the
subpoena
asked
for
records
related
to
trump
and
several
of
his
family
members
democrats
cheered
as
federal
judges
in
two
subpoena
challenges
rejected
arguments
from
trump's
personal
attorneys
that
congress
couldn't
go
sifting
through
his
personal
financial
information
but
they
were
celebrating
the
favorable
precedent
not
any
certainty
that
the
deutsche
subpoena
would
yield
the
tax
documents
they
were
looking
for
since
nobody
knew
for
sure
if
the
bank
had
them
among
other
demands
the
deutsche
subpoena
sought
trump's
tax
returns
and
schedules
including
those
showing
all
foreign
sources
of
income
all
foreign
debt
payments
all
interests
held
by
the
taxpayer
in
any
foreign
business
entity
or
bank
brokerage
account
a
separate
subpoena
issued
to
the
accounting
firm
mazars
did
not
specifically
request
tax
info
at
oral
argument
last
week
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
nd
circuit
asked
house
general
counsel
douglas
letter
if
complying
with
the
subpoenas
in
the
deutsche
case
might
violate
the
federal
disclosure
law
that
democrats
are
using
to
try
to
get
the
president's
tax
returns
in
the
ways
and
means
case
that
law
generally
prohibits
disclosing
private
tax
information
except
in
certain
circumstances
including
in
response
to
requests
by
state
agencies
and
congressional
committees
letter
said
the
prohibitions
would
not
apply
to
deutsche
bank
in
this
case
although
he
also
said
he
had
no
idea
if
the
german
multinational
bank
actually
had
the
returns
the
court
then
ordered
deutsche
bank
and
capital
one
to
disclose
whether
they
had
the
material
deutsche
bank
said
it
did
based
on
deutsche
bank's
current
knowledge
and
the
results
of
the
extensive
searches
that
have
already
been
conducted
the
bank
has
in
its
possession
tax
returns
that
are
responsive
to
the
subpoena
the
bank
told
the
court
on
tuesday
the
tax
returns
may
belong
to
the
president
himself
his
children
or
some
combination
it's
pretty
certain
the
house
financial
services
and
intelligence
committees
will
get
trump's
tax
returns
before
the
ways
and
means
committee
said
steve
rosenthal
a
senior
fellow
with
the
urban-brookings
tax
policy
center
he
noted
that
the
deutsche
bank
case
is
already
at
the
appeals
stage
while
the
ways
and
means
case
is
bogged
down
at
the
trial
court
level
the
documents
requested
by
ways
and
means
chairman
richard
neal
d-mass
may
be
more
illuminating
since
neal
asked
for
audit
information
in
addition
to
tax
returns
the
committee
also
said
last
week
that
a
whistleblower
had
come
forward
with
evidence
that
someone
may
have
interfered
with
an
internal
revenue
service
audit
of
the
president
but
it's
possible
the
ways
and
means
case
will
not
be
resolved
before
november
and
even
if
neal
wins
the
case
the
information
still
has
to
come
from
donald
trump's
government
deutsche
bank
will
be
more
cooperative
than
trump's
irs
rosenthal
said
related
coverage
deutsche
bank
has
information
related
to
probe
of
trump
finances
trump
would
reap
millions
for
his
company
if
fed
slices
interest
rates
democrats
insist
they
haven't
been
wasting
time
on
trump's
tax
returns
