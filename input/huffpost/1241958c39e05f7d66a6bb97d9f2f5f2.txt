august
asked
for
comment
on
walsh's
decision
to
jump
into
the
race
a
spokesman
for
trump's
reelection
campaign
said
in
a
statement
whatever
walsh
like
trump
is
a
prolific
tweeter
who
has
garnered
a
large
following
through
controversial
statements
made
online
as
well
as
through
his
syndicated
radio
show
but
unlike
trump
walsh
has
spent
much
of
the
recent
past
trying
to
distance
himself
from
bigotry
he
espoused
during
his
time
as
a
congressman
and
as
a
private
citizen
since
in
an
august
new
york
times
op-ed
walsh
called
the
president
a
racial
arsonist
who
encourages
bigotry
and
xenophobia
to
arouse
his
base
and
tried
to
reckon
with
his
past
as
a
trump
voter
and
a
successful
target
of
this
arousal
trump
s
caused
me
to
change
my
tone
and
to
reflect
upon
where
i
went
over
the
line
he
wrote
walsh
didn't
specify
which
of
his
past
viewpoints
he
now
regrets
walsh
entered
congress
as
a
self-described
tea
party
republican
in
when
a
wave
of
staunchly
conservative
candidates
gave
republicans
a
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
time
since
he
has
found
himself
at
the
center
of
a
number
of
controversies
rooted
in
statements
he's
made
about
former
president
barack
obama
muslims
women
and
others
in
for
example
walsh
accused
tammy
duckworth
his
democratic
challenger
at
the
time
of
not
being
a
true
hero
and
overemphasizing
her
service
as
a
war
veteran
duckworth
who
now
represents
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
u.s.
senate
had
both
legs
amputated
after
iraqi
insurgents
downed
her
helicopter
with
a
rocket-propelled

what
else
has
she
done
walsh
asked
during
an
interview
female
wounded
veteran
ehh
that
same
year
he
declared
american
muslims
an
imminent
threat
to
national
security
suggesting
they'd
infiltrated
his
home
state
to
kill
other
americans
he
predicted
that
an
attack
similar
to
those
that
occurred
on
sept
was
all
but
guaranteed
in
june
walsh
issued
a
threat
through
twitter
against
obama
and
members
of
the
black
lives
matter
movement
blaming
them
for
a
dallas
shooting
in
which
five
police
officers
were
killed
and
six
others
were
injured

is
now

to
parroting
some
of
trump's
baseless
accusations
that
obama

secretly
a
muslim
sent
to
destroy
real
america
walsh
spent
much
of
advocating
for
a
trump
presidency
and
speaking
on
his
behalf
on
television
and
radio
he
even
said
he'd
take
up
arms
if
trump
lost
the
election
and
encouraged
his
followers
to
do
the
same
walsh
on
sunday
said
he
regrets
using
hateful
rhetoric
to
attack
his
political
opponents
there
were
plenty
of
times
that
i
went
beyond
the
policy
and
the
idea

and
i
got
personal
and
i
got
hateful
walsh
told
abc
i
said
some
ugly
things
about
president
obama
that
i
regret
but
host
george

continued
to
grill
walsh
over
his
past
remarks
toward
women
and
people
of

calling
them
textbook
racism

the
beauty

on
some
of
the
things

walsh
said
adding
that
he
doesn't
actually
believe
obama
is
a
muslim
we
have
a
guy
in
the
white
house
who
has
never
apologized
for
anything
he's
done
or
said
i
helped
create

he
continued
there's
no
doubt
about
that
