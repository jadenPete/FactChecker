democrats
just
got
a
break
in
their
trump
tax
return
case
a
whistleblower's
allegation
of
interference
with
the
president's
irs
audit
hints
at
another
way
to
obtain
those
tax
returns
house
democrats
revealed
this
week
that
a
federal
employee
has
come
to
them
with
information
about
possible
misconduct
relating
to
an
internal
revenue
service
audit
of
president
donald
trump
it's
a
big
development
in
democrats
quest
for
trump's
tax
returns
first
the
whistleblower
could
boost
their
legal
case
democrats
want
to
see
the
president's
tax
returns
partly
because
they
don't
trust
him
not
to
improperly
influence
his
audit
the
irs
has
said
such
concerns
are
unfounded
but
if
democrats
have
evidence
of
possible
interference
those
concerns
would
be
pretty
well-founded
democrats
on
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
sued
the
trump
administration
in
july
for
defying
a
federal
disclosure
law
that
is
supposed
to
give
certain
congressional
committee
chairs
access
to
anyone's
private
tax
information
the
treasury
department
has
refused
to
turn
over
the
president's
tax
returns
in
response
to
first
a
formal
request
and
then
a
subpoena
from
the
ways
and
means
panel
the
committee's
lawyers
revealed
their
whistleblower
material
this
week
in
a
motion
that
asked
u.s.
district
judge
trevor
mcfadden
to
hurry
up
and
order
the
administration
to
obey
the
law
the
case
which
is
currently
in
the
district
of
columbia's
federal
trial
court
could
run
longer
than
a
year
due
to
appeals
another
reason
the
whistleblower
is
a
big
deal
is
that
he
or
she
might
be
able
to
give
the
committee
information
on
trump's
tax
returns
the
law
empowers
irs
whistleblowers
to
divulge
material
to
congress
in
most
situations
it
is
highly
illegal
for
irs
employees
to
expose
private
tax
information
but
they
can
give
it
to
the
house
ways
and
means
or
senate
finance
committee
if
they
suspect
wrongdoing
specifically
the
law
says
that
an
irs
employee
who
has
access
to
returns
can
divulge
documents
to
tax
committees
if
such
person
believes
such
return
or
return
information
may
relate
to
possible
misconduct
maladministration
or
taxpayer
abuse
associated
press
rep
richard
neal
chairman
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
is
leading
democrats
quest
for
trump's
tax
returns
it's
possible
that
the
whistleblower
knows
something
related
to
the
ongoing
audit
that
trump
repeatedly
referred
to
on
the
campaign
trail
said
steve
rosenthal
a
senior
fellow
at
the
urban-brookings
tax
policy
center
when
trump
became
president
maybe
he
fussed
with
that
process
in
some
way
the
best
case
for
trying
to
figure
out
whether
trump
is
interfering
with
an
audit
would
be
to
look
at
the
earliest
returns
that
were
open
for
audit
after
he
took
office
rosenthal
said
a
ways
and
means
spokesperson
said
the
committee
has
not
obtained
the
tax
returns
it
requested
from
the
irs
earlier
this
year
chairman
richard
neal
d-mass
asked
for
six
years
of
trump's
personal
and
business
returns
plus
anything
related
to
audits
for
those
years
since
complicated
audits
can
take
years
to
complete
those
started
within
the
last
six
years
might
still
be
open
for
that
reason
rosenthal
has
argued
that
neal
should
have
asked
for
documents
from
well
before
the
committee
received
an
unsolicited
communication
from
a
federal
employee
setting
forth
credible
allegations
of
evidence
of
possible
misconduct
the
possibility
that
democrats
might
obtain
trump's
tax
returns
from
a
tipster
has
been
raised
before
in
february
bryan
camp
and
victor
thuronyi
respectively
a
texas
tech
law
professor
and
a
former
lead
counsel
for
the
international
monetary
fund
wrote
that
a
whistleblower
could
dump
the
tax
returns
in
ways
and
means
lap
but
they
noted
that
sounds
like
a
simpler
solution
than
it
is
very
few
irs
employees
have
access
to
tax
returns
and
the
whistleblower
part
of
the
tax
code
doesn't
necessarily
permit
disclosure
in
cases
of
misconduct
by
the
taxpayers
themselves
like
tax
evasion
the
history
of
the
statute
suggests
that
it
may
refer
only
to
the
misconduct
or
maladministration
by
the
irs
or
its
employees
camp
and
thuronyi
wrote
the
house
democrats
court
filing
this
week
describes
possible
misconduct
by
government
agents
the
irs
automatically
audits
the
president
and
vice
president
each
year
and
someone
allegedly
may
have
interfered
with
that
process
the
motion
says
that
in
late
july
the
committee
received
an
unsolicited
communication
from
a
federal
employee
setting
forth
credible
allegations
of
evidence
of
possible
misconduct

potential
inappropriate
efforts

to
give

more
details
in

sen
chuck
grassley
is
fond
of
the
tax
disclosure
law
but
apparently
not
when
democrats
use
it
according
to
the
filing
neal
asked
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
to
hand
over
documents
and
communications
of
specified
treasury
and
irs
employees
after
receiving
the
tip
but
mnuchin
refused
saying
treasury
didn't
have
any
relevant
documents
covered
under
the
disclosure
law
which
is
known
as
section
george
yin
a
tax
professor
emeritus
at
the
university
of
virginia
school
of

said
that
mnuchin's
specific
reference
to
section
seemed
deliberate

said

on

which
is
a
joint
house-senate
panel
controlled
by
neal

r-iowa
might
be
able
to
ask
for

under

data
grassley
a
champion
of
whistleblowers
throughout
the
federal

is
the
person
most
responsible
for
adding
the
whistleblower
provision
to

the

worked
his
entire
career
to
make
sure
whistleblowers
can

without
fear
of
reprisal
said
his

michael

as
chairman
of
the

grassley
has
used
to
investigate
possible
wrongdoing

by
his
political
enemies

he's
not
at
all
impressed
by

efforts
to

democrats
have
made

their
only
goal
is
to
