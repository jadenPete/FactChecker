trump
slapped
with
first
lawsuit
after
endangered
species
act
rollback
the
new
rules
are
a
breathtaking
and
illegal
attack
on
the
bedrock
conservation
law
an
earthjustice
attorney
said
eight
environmental
groups
on
wednesday
filed
what
will
likely
be
the
first
of
many
lawsuits
to
block
the
trump
administration's
sweeping
overhaul
of
the
endangered
species
act
the
page
complaint
filed
by
earthjustice
in
the
u.
s
district
court
of
northern
california
comes
just
over
a
week
after
the
interior
department
finalized
new
rules
that
significantly
weaken
the
law
arguably
america's
most
important
tool
for
protecting
imperiled
plants
and
animals
the
esa
rule
changes
make
it
easier
for
federal
agencies
to
remove
species
from
the
protected
list
allow
for
economic
impacts
to
be
considered
when
making
decisions
about
granting
species
protection
and
limit
agencies
ability
to
account
for
the
impacts
of
future
climate
change
they
also
diminish
protections
for
future
threatened
species
and
revise
how
agencies
go
about
designating
habitat
as
critical
to
species
long-term
survival
the
rollback
comes
amid
a
human-caused
biodiversity
crisis
that
has
pushed
up
to
million
species
around
the
globe
to
the
brink
of
extinction
the
lawsuit
argues
that
the
trump
administration
violated
the
national
environmental
policy
act
by
failing
to
analyze
the
impact
of
its
revisions
and
that
the
final
rules
include
changes
that
weren't
in
the
initial
proposal
and
that
the
public
never
had
a
chance
to
weigh
in
on
nepa
requires
federal
agencies
to
look
before
they
leap
drew
caputo
the
vice
president
of
litigation
for
lands
wildlife
and
oceans
at
earthjustice
told
huffpost
they
just
leapt
the
revised
regulations
violate
the
plain
language
and
overarching
purpose
of
the
esa
the
complaint
reads
earthjustice
is
representing
seven
other
environmental
groups
in
the
lawsuit
including
defenders
of
wildlife
the
center
for
biological
diversity
and
the
natural
resources
defense
council
the
same
group
of
plaintiffs
has
also
filed
a
notice
of
intent
to
sue
over
other
aspects
of
the
overhaul
in
an
emailed
statement
interior
spokesman
nick
goodwin
said
it
is
unsurprising
that
those
who
repeatedly
seek
to
weaponize
the
endangered
species
act
instead
of
use
it
as
a
means
to
recover
imperiled
species
would
choose
to
sue
we
will
see
them
in
court
and
we
will
be
steadfast
in
our
implementation
of
this
important
act
with
the
unchanging
goal
of
conserving
and
recovering
species

u.s.
july
the
administration
has
painted
the
overhaul
as
an
honest
attempt
to
modernize
and
improve
implementation
of
the
law
saying
the
changes
will
lift
regulatory
burdens
on
business
while
continuing
to
safeguard
species
but
republicans
have
for
decades
been
trying
to
chip
away
at
the
law
arguing
it
has
been
abused
to
block
economic
development
and
hatred
for
the
esa
is
common
inside
trump's
interior
department
several
agency
officials
have
histories
of
slamming
the
law
calling
it
a
sword
to
tear
down
the
american
economy
likening
species
listings
to
incoming
scud
missiles
and
voicing
support
for
repealing
the
law
entirely
the
previous
regulations
utilized
by
the
department
of
the
interior
often
took
a
one-size-fits-all
approach
to
species
protections
making
species

recovery

difficult

the

there
is
nothing
in
their
proposal
that

he
told
huffpost
everything
in
it
is
harmful
and
that
shouldn't
be
a
surprise
because
the

here
the

these

the

are

becerra

we
