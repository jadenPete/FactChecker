trump
wants
to
detain
migrant
families
indefinitely
he
can't
the
plan
would
require
a
massive
restructuring
of
the
migrant
detention
system
the
white
house
dramatically
escalated
its
campaign
to
scare
central
american
families
away
from
crossing
the
u.s.
border
on
wednesday
as
officials
announced
plans
to
cancel
the
flores
settlement
the
change
would
eliminate
restrictions
requiring
the
release
of
migrant
children
from
family
detention
centers
within
days
but
the
white
house
plan
is
going
to
face
an
uphill
battle
with
math
among
other
things
the
trump
administration
has
three
family
detention
centers
at
its
disposal
with
a
combined
capacity
of
around
people
on
paper
last
month
some
migrants
traveling
as
families
crossed
into
the
u.s.
just
between
ports
of
entry
according
to
customs
and
border
protection
if
those
numbers
hold
as
the
trump
administration's
new
family
detention
policy
goes
into
effect
ice
will
fill
its
family
detention
to
capacity
in
about
three
days
that
would
leave
immigration
authorities
little
choice
but
to
release
incoming
families
with
a
notice
to
appear
in
immigration
court
the
same
situation
it
faces
today
not
only
is
this
cruel
it
also
doesn't
accomplish
anything
kevin
landy
a
political
appointee
during
the
obama
administration
who
led
efforts
to
reform
ice
detention
facilities
told
huffpost
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
families
who
come
here
will
be
detained
for
an
agonizingly
long
time
and
trump
officials
will
probably
not
be
especially
concerned
about
ensuring
humane
conditions

both
of
which

of

hold
children
in
the
same

as
unrelated

children
of
different
genders
from
separate

ice
does
not
publicly
disclose
the
pod

at
those

the
agency
considers
proprietary

to
the
private

ice's
second-largest

lock-up

is
currently
housing
adults
rather
than
families
it's
not
like
they've
been
detaining
every
family
for
days
and
then
forced
to
release
them
because
of
flores
mark
greenberg
a
senior
fellow
with
the
nonpartisan
migration
policy
institute
said
they
will
continue
to
point
to
flores
as
the
problem
but
the
reality
is
they
have
had
very
little
capacity
for
family
detention
homeland
security
secretary
kevin
mcaleenan
has
asserted
that
the
trump
administration
plan
eliminates
a
key
incentive
that
encourages
traffickers
to
exploit
children
his
words
echoed
a
longstanding
demand
from
immigration
restrictionists
within
the
trump
administration
who
deride
flores
as
a
loophole
allowing
central
american
families
to
evade
deportation
by
filing
humanitarian
relief
claims
like
asylum
knowing
that
doing
so
will
allow
them
to
avoid
landing
in
a
detention
center
indefinitely
acting
director
of
ice
matthew
albence
has
expressed
confidence
that
keeping
families
locked
in
detention
while
their
cases
play
out
will
result
in
swifter
deportations
and
discourage
others
from
coming
those
migrant
families
who
had
their
cases
adjudicated
while
detained
back
in
before
a
federal
judge
ruled
that
locking
kids
up
indefinitely
violated
the
flores
settlement
got
a
final
decision
within
days
on
average
albence
told
cnn
but
barbara
hines
a
former
director
of
the
university
of
texas
law
school's
immigration
clinic
who
worked
with
detained
families
during
that
period
distrusted
ice's
figure
the
average
might
have
been
skewed
down
by
families
who
did
not
have
lawyers
or
go
through
the
appeals
process
but
she
routinely
saw
cases
that
lasted
between
six
and
nine
months
hines
said
quite
a
few
of
those
cases
were
won
hines
said
certainly
if
you
appeal
your
case
children
are
going
to
be
in
detention
far
longer
than
days
and
days
is
unacceptable
for
children
it's
really
unacceptable
for
any
migrant
seeking
protection
in
the
united
states
solving
the
problem
to
them
means
destroying
the
asylum
system
the
white
house's
plan
is
certain
to
face
legal
challenges
but
if
it
moves
forward
it's
unclear
how
the
trump
administration
will
overcome
the
logistical
hurdle
posed
by
the
lack
of
bed
space
in
the
face
of
record-level
family
crossings
ice
issued
a
request
for
contractors
to
submit
plans
for
facilities
capable
of
detaining
up
to
migrant
families
last
year
but
has
yet
to
move
forward
an
expansion
of
that
magnitude
would
cost
ice
about
billion
per
year
about
one-quarter
of
the
agency's
total
budget
they
will
continue
to
point
to
flores
as
the
problem
but
the
reality
is
they
have
had
very
little
capacity
for
family
detention
mark
greenberg
migration
policy
institute
any
hope
of
scaling
up
such
a
towering
family
detention
system
evaporated
with
the
midterm
election
which
brought
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
back
to
the
democrats
most
house
democrats
wanted
family
immigrant
detention
abolished
back
when
obama
was
president
it's
even
less
palatable
for
them
with
their
nemesis
trump
in
charge
ice's
current
budget
provides
no
extra
money
for
immigrant
family
lock-ups
and
the
agency
has
yet
to
announce
plans
for
more
facilities
we're
not
going
to
speculate
as
to
future
scenarios
ice
spokesperson
bryan
cox
wrote
in
an
email
to
huffpost
that
leaves
ice
with
few
options
for
expanding
family
detention
the
agency
could
hold
more
families
by
diverting
money
away
from
detaining
single
adults
homeland
security
has
rifled
through
the
pockets
of
its
other
agencies
in
the
past
to
pilfer
money
for
ice's
overspending
on
detention
but
without
extra
money
none
of
those
options
is
likely
to
change
the
status
quo
ice
is
already
detaining
thousands
more
migrants
than
congress
has
directed
it
to
it
costs
about
three
times
as
much
to
lock
up
a
parent
or
child
in
a
family
detention
center
as
it
does
to
detain
an
adult
unaccompanied
by
a
child
and
setting
up
new
family
detention
centers
on
short
notice
typically
inflates
the
cost
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
still
have
the
same
three
facilities
a
former
homeland
security
official
told
huffpost
they
still
have
the
same
number
of
family
beds
family
detention
is
not
a
plug-and-play
system
like
adult
detention
you
can't
just
make
a
call
and
get
a
county
jail
to
come
online
immigrant
advocacy
groups
and
legal
organizations
decried
the
trump
administration's
long-desired
plan
to
skirt
the
legal
restrictions
imposed
on
child
detention
by
the
flores
settlement
they
often
cite
the
damaging
mental
health
effects
of
locking
up
children
and
point
to
the
availability
of
alternatives
to
detention
that
the
white
house
could
expand
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
family
detention
the
lawyers
who
represent
the
migrant
children
as
a
class
in
the
ongoing
litigation
over
flores
already
filed
a
motion
in
federal
court
back
in
november
to
block
the
trump
administration
from
trying
to
nix
the
settlement
u.s.
district
judge
dolly
gee
held
off
on
ruling
until
the
trump
administration
sets
its
order
in
writing
gee
has
criticized
prolonged
family
detention
in
prior
rulings
raising
the
possibility
that
the
white
house
plan
could
get
blocked
in
court
before
it
goes
into
effect
two
months
from
now
there
is
a
system
in

called
freedom
that

their

to
