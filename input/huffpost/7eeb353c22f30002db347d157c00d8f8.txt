says
a
national
farm
organization
representing
many
of
the
same
rural
voters
who
helped
put
donald
trump
in
the
white
house
issued
a
scathing
statement
friday
accusing
the
president
of
burning
bridges
with
trading
partners
and
making
the
devastating
trade
war
with
china
even
worse
instead
of
looking
to
solve
existing
problems
in
our
agricultural
sector
this
administration
has
just
created
new
ones
said
a
statement
issued
by
roger
johnson
president
of
the
national
farmers
union
which
represents
about
family
farmers
ranchers
and
fishers
in

between
burning
bridges
with
all
of
our
biggest
trading
partners
and
undermining
our
domestic
biofuels
industry
president
trump
is
making

johnson
said
it's
no
surprise
that
china
is
increasing
tariffs
on
u.s.
products
because
each
time
trump
ratchets
up
tariffs
china
calls
his
bluff
johnson
pointed
out
that
u.s.
farm
income
is
down
since
and
soybean
exports
to
china
have
fallen
nearly
in
the
past
three
years
as
american
farmers
take
on
record
levels
of
debt
to
weather
the
storm
once
these
tariffs
kick
in
things
are
likely
to
get
worse

the
stinging
statement
is
the
latest
indication
of
a
growing
rift
between
trump
and
the
farmers
he
has
hailed
as
great
patriots
who
support
him
corn
growers
were
stunned
this
month
after
trump
reportedly
ordered
that
waivers
be
granted
to
fuel
refineries
exempting
them
from
a
federal
policy
mandating
the
use
of
corn-based
ethanol
sen

said
farmers
were
screwed
as
demand
for
corn
will
plummet
even
further
as
farmers
fight
for
their
livelihoods

agriculture
department
secretary
sonny
perdue
cracked
a
joke
about
whining
farmers
at
a
minnesota
meeting
with
farmers
which
drew
some
boos
it
was
definitely
not
an
appropriate
thing
to

minnesota
farmers

president
gary
wertish
told
huffpost
at
the
time
it
took
everyone
by
surprise
he
doesn't
understand
what
farmers
are
dealing
with
and
he's
the
head
of
the
department
of
agriculture
agriculture
is
hardly
the
only
industry
staggered
by
the
escalating
trade
war
the

chamber
of
commerce
issued
a
statement
friday
calling
for
constructive
engagement

china
to
