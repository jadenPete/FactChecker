rick

a
key
cooperator
in
special
counsel
robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
testified
thursday
against
a
prominent
washington
attorney
accused
of
concealing
information
from
the
justice
department
about
work
done
for
the
government
of
ukraine
gates
a
former
campaign
aide
to
president
donald
trump
who
pleaded
guilty
last
year
in
mueller's
investigation
took
the
stand
as
a
government
witness
against
greg
craig
it
was
the
latest
installment
of
gates
effort
to
secure
leniency
from
the
justice
department
in
exchange
for
his
cooperation
with
multiple
probes
among
those
is
the
case
against
craig
an
offshoot
of
mueller's
investigation
into
potential
ties
between
the
trump
campaign
and
russia
and
part
of
an
ongoing
justice
department
crackdown
on
unregistered
lobbying
in
the
u.s.
on
behalf
of
foreign
governments
and
other
entities
gates
spent
hours
describing
the
international
political
consulting
work
he
and
business
associate
paul
manafort
a
co-defendant
in
the
mueller
investigation
who's
been
sentenced
to
more
than
seven
years
in
prison
did
for
a
pro-russia
ukrainian
political
party
and
how
craig
came
to
be
involved
in
some
of
those
efforts
the
work
that
drew
the
justice
department's
attention
occurred
in
when
craig
and
his
law
firm
at
the
time
skadden
arps
slate
meagher
and
flom
were
hired
by
the
government
of
ukraine
to
write
a
report
on
the
prosecution
of
yulia
tymoshenko
a
former
ukrainian
prime
minister
tymoshenko
was
a
political
opponent
of
then-ukrainian
president
viktor
yanukovych
a
longtime
manafort
patron
and
a
political
figure
whom
gates
said
he
and
manafort
had
helped
get
elected
the
report
was
billed
as
independent
but
critics
have
said
it
whitewashed
a
politically
motivated
prosecution
and
gates
acknowledged
on
the
witness
stand
that
the
document
was
conceived
as
a
way
to
counter
international
criticism
that
tymoshenko
had
been
denied
a
fair
trial
gates
said
manafort
arranged
for
the
hiring
of
skadden
to
prepare
the
report
and
said
he
served
as
an
intermediary
for
the
firm
and
worked
with
craig
on
a
publicity
plan
for
the
document
that
included
giving
an
embargoed
copy
to
new
york
times
reporter
david
sanger
though
the
article
was
not
entirely
favorable
gates
said
he
considered
the
strategy
a
success
given
the
credibility
he
believed
was
associated
with
the
publication
and
the
reporter
from
our
standpoint
the
success
of
it
was
very
great
gates
said
when
a
prosecutor
asked
whether
craig
had
carried
out
the
role
he
had
committed
to
with
regard
to
the
times
gates
answered
yes
he
did
craig
who
has
called
the
prosecution
unprecedented
and
unjustified
decided
that
he
did
not
need
to
register
his
work
with
a
justice
department
unit
tasked
with
enforcing
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
the
law
enacted
in
to
unmask
nazi
propaganda
in
the
united
states
requires
people
to
disclose
to
the
justice
department
when
they
advocate
lobby
or
perform
public
relations
work
in
the
u.s.
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government
or
political
entity
though
prosecutors
have
not
charged
craig
with
failing
to
register
they
said
he
gave
the
justice
department
misleading
information
about
the
work
when
the
fara
unit
informed
him
and
his
firm
that
they
thought
he
might
need
to
disclose
his
work
craig
was
charged
in
april
in
a
two-count
indictment
but
the
judge
overseeing
the
case
dismissed
one
of
the
charges
before
trial
craig's
lawyers
deny
that
he
lied
to
the
government
or
his
law
firm
they
acknowledged
that
craig
spoke
to
reporters
about
the
report
but
denied
it
was
part
of
a
public
relations
campaign
that
would
run
afoul
of
the
law
during
cross-examination
a
lawyer
for
craig
paula
junghans
sought
to
distance
craig
from
gates
and
tried
to
cast
doubt
on
the
idea
that
her
client
was
doing
the
bidding
of
the
ukraine
government
she
showed
excerpts
from
the
report
that
raised
important
questions
about
the
fairness
of
the
tymoshenko
trial
including
a
statement
that
said
under
western
standards
we
find
that
the
decision
to
detain
tymoshenko
for
the
entire
balance
of
her
trial
and
after
the
trial
had
concluded
until
sentencing
without
adequate
justification
or
review
raises
concerns
about
whether
she
was
inappropriately
deprived
of
her
liberty
prior
to
her
conviction
junghans
also
sought
to
undermine
gates
credibility
by
noting
the
wide-ranging
tax
and
financial
fraud
conspiracy
he
admitted
to
last
year
and
the
fact
that
prosecutors
have
agreed
not
to
charge
him
with
certain
conduct
in
exchange
for
his
cooperation
when
it
comes
to
crimes
junghans
said
you've
committed
quite
a
few
haven't
you
