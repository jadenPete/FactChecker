tumbles
after
donald
trump
calls
fed
chair
enemy
compares
him
to
chinese
leader
the
dow
jones
fell
more
than
points
after
the
president
attacked
jerome
powell
and
ordered
u.s.
companies
to
cease
relations
with
china
president
donald
trump
continued
his
attacks
on
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
on
friday
calling
powell
an
enemy
as
the
fed
resists
drastically
altering
monetary
policy
at
the
president's
whim
in
a
tweet
misspelling
the
chairman's
name
trump
who
nominated
powell
to
chair
the
central
bank
in
questioned
whether
powell
is
a
greater
enemy
of
america
than
chinese
president
xi
jinping
trump
later
deleted
the
tweet
and
replaced
it
with
one
correctly
spelling
powell's
name
the
president's
invective
seems
to
have
been
inspired
by
china's
announcement
friday
that
it
will
impose
additional
tariffs
on
billion
in
u.s.
goods
ramping
up
the
ongoing
trade
war
it's
also
possible
trump
was
responding
to
statements
powell
made
during
a
meeting
with
bankers
friday
morning
although
powell
reportedly
said
the
federal
reserve
was
prepared
to
cut
interest
rates
if
necessary
the
chairman
was
noncommittal
about
when
these
cuts
could
come
or
how
steep
they
would
be
after
setting
his
sights
on
powell
trump
posted
a
series
of
tweets
in
which
he
said
the
u.s.
would
be
better
off
without
china
and
ordered
u.s.
companies
to
find
alternative
business
partners
our
country
has
lost
stupidly
trillions
of
dollars
with
china
over
many
years
they
have
stolen
our
intellectual
property
at
a
rate
of
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
a
year
they
want
to
continue
i
won't
let
that
happen

need
china
