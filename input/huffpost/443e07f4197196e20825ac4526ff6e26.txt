to
justice

finding
james
comey
violated
fbi
policy
comey
did
not
however
leak
classified
information
to
the
media
as
the
president
has
regularly
claimed
president
donald
trump
on
thursday
welcomed
parts
of
a
report
by
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
that
concluded
former
fbi
director
james
comey
had
violated
fbi
policies
in
his
handling
of
certain
memos
regarding
his
interactions
with
the
president
while
ignoring
parts
of
the
report
that
refute
his
own
repeated
claims
trump
said
the
ig's
findings
leave
comey
thoroughly
disgraced
and
excoriated
perhaps
never
in
the
history
of
our
country
has
someone
been
more
thoroughly
disgraced
and
excoriated
than
james
comey
in
the
just
released
inspector
general's
report
he
should
be
ashamed
of
himself

august
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
echoed
the
president's
falsehoods
in
an
official
statement
thursday
afternoon
again
ignoring
that
the
report
found
comey
did
not
leak
classified
information
to
the
press
contrary
to
trump's
claims
here's
the
statement
in
full
james
comey
is
a
proven
liar
and
leaker
the
inspector
general's
report
shows
comey
violated
the
most
basic
obligations
of
confidentiality
that
he
owed
to
the
united
states
government
and
to
the
american
people
in
order
to
achieve
a
personally
desired
outcome
because
comey
shamefully
leaked
information
to
the
press
in
blatant
violation
of
fbi
policies
the
nation
was
forced
to
endure
the
baseless
politically
motivated
two-year
witch
hunt
comey
disgraced
himself
and
his
office
to
further
a
personal
political
agenda
and
this
report
further
confirms
that
fact
in
statements
of
his
own
on
twitter
comey
was
quick
to
note
that
the
ig
report
absolved
him
of
sharing
classified
information
with
the
media
a
claim
that
had
been
regularly
amplified
by
the
gop
and
the
president
himself
the
report
found
no
evidence
that
comey
or
his
attorneys
released
any
of
the
classified
information
contained
in
any
of
the
memos
to
members
of
the
media
comey

the
ig's

i
don't
need
a
public
apology
from
those
who
defamed
me
but
a
quick
message
with
a
sorry
we
lied
about

comey
august
the
report
directly
refutes
trump's
opposing
claims
in
which
he
regularly
smeared
comey
with
baseless
charges

comey
is
a
proven
leaker
liar
virtually
everyone
in

the
terrible
job
he
did-until
he
was
in
fact
fired
he
leaked
classified
information
for
which
he
should
be
prosecuted
he
lied

he
is
a
