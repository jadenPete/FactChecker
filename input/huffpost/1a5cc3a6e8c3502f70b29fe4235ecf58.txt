mentioned
the

who
frequently
used
his
platform
to
spread
anti-semitic
messages
across
the
country
and
the
world
president
donald
trump
twice
invoked
anti-semitic
automotive
pioneer
henry
ford
on
wednesday
just
hours
after
he
again
accused
jewish
democrats
of
being
disloyal
to
israel
trump
tweeted
about
ford
in
relation
to
auto
companies
opting
to
follow
california's
stricter
emission
standards
opposing
the
president's
rollbacks
that
would
worsen
air
pollution
and
speed
up
climate
change
honda
ford
volkswagen
and
bmw
had
already
joined
the
california
agreement
and
more
companies
are
expected
to
participate
according
to
the
new
york
times
the
legendary
henry
ford
and
alfred
p.
sloan
the
founders
of
ford
motor
company
and
general
motors
are
rolling
over
at
the
weakness
of
current
car
company
executives
willing
to
spend
more
money
on
a
car
that
is
not
as
safe
or
good
and
cost
more
to
consumers
trump
tweeted
in
another
tweet
immediately
following
henry
ford
would
be
very
disappointed
if
he
saw
his
modern-day
descendants
wanting
to
build
a
much
more
expensive
car
that
is
far
less
safe
and
doesn't
work
as
well
because
execs
don't
want
to
fight
california
regulators

that
when

available
california
will
squeeze
them
to
a
point

only
reason
california
is
now
talking

is
because

are
giving

ford
founded
the
ford
motor
co
in
michigan
pioneering
assembly-line
production
in
his
factories
and
creating
the
revolutionary
model
t.
he
was
also
a
well-known
anti-semite
and
nazi
sympathizer
ford
was
heavily
involved
in
trying
to
lift
up
anti-semitic
messages
in
the
u.s.
the
carmaker
was
convinced
in
the
early
s
that
jewish
people
were
responsible
for
world
war
i
and
used
his
status
as
one
of
the
most
famous
men
in
america
to
legitimize
that
rhetoric
in
ford
bought
his
hometown
newspaper
the
dearborn
independent
and
began
publishing
a
series
of
articles
claiming
jews
worked
against
american
interests
through
alleged
foreign
connections
and
were
the
root
of
the
world's
problems
the
series
ran
in
more
than
issues
until
ford
compiled
them
into
four
volumes
titled
the
international
jew
and
distributed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
copies
to
his
network
of
dealerships
and
subscribers
according
to
pbs
american
experience
series
ford
also
received
a
civilian
award
in
from
the
nazi
regime
the
grand
cross
of
the
german
eagle
researchers
and
historians
also
say
adolf
hilter
was
aware
of
ford
and
admired
his
writings
hanging
a
portrait
of
ford
in
his
office
in
and
reportedly
telling
a
detroit
news
reporter
i
regard
henry
ford
as
my
inspiration
ford
is
the
only
american
mentioned
by
name
in
hitler's
manifesto
mein
kampf
according
to
the
washington
post
though
trump's
mention
of
ford
may
seem
harmless
the
tweet
came
while
he's
been
flinging
his
own
anti-semitic
rhetoric
adding
to
the
list
of
offensive
statements
he's
made
in
the
past
two
days
wednesday
morning
trump
told
reporters
that
jewish
people
who
vote
for
democrats
are
disloyal
to
israel
nearly
of
jewish
voters
supported
democrats
in
the
midterm
elections
according
to
the
pew
research
center
the
statement
was
a
doubling
down
of
the
president's
remarks
a
day
earlier
when
he
followed
his
now-routine
attacks
of
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
and
ilhan
omar
d-minn
by
saying
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
i
think
it
shows
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
later
wednesday
trump
tweeted
a
quote
from
conspiracy
theorist
wayne
allyn
root
that
said
he
was
the
greatest
president
for
jews
and
for
israel
and
that
jewish
people
in
israel
love
trump
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
and
the
second
coming
of
god
people
of
the
jewish
faith
do
not
believe
in
a
second
coming
trump
told
reporters
earlier
wednesday
that
he
hadn't
heard
anyone
call
his
blatant
dual
loyalty
claim
anti-semitic
but
democrats
and
jewish
leaders
publicly
condemned
the
president
for
invoking
the
trope
which
accuses
jewish
americans
of
having
dual
loyalties
to
the
u.s.
and
foreign
countries
such
as
israel
a
claim
that
ford
was
happy
to
make
the
connection
did
not
go
unnoticed
on
twitter
henry
ford
was
a
nazi
sympathizer
who
wrote
a
publication
called
the
international
jew
the
world's
foremost
problem
he
directly
inspired
hitler
youth
said
jews
provoke
mass
violence
unsurprising
that
a
man
who
calls
jews
disloyal
invokes
him
you're
both
antisemites
