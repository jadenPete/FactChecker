meddling

the

are
just
ridiculous
one
va
physician
complained
about
the
three
men's
interference
a
new
trove
of
documents
has
exposed
how
intrusively
a
trio
of
donald
trump's
wealthy
friends
at
mar-a-lago
with
absolutely
no
government
experience
meddled
in
the
operations
of
the
department
of
veterans
affairs
and
pestered
staff
with
what
one
va
physician
called
ridiculous
questions
and
demands
the
nonprofit
citizens
for
responsibility
and
ethics
crew
in
washington
has
obtained
more
than
pages
of
emails
involving
golf
resort
members
close
to
trump
who
decided
to
reshape
operations
at
the
department
that
provides
health
care
for
million
vets
marvel
entertainment
chairman
isaac
ike
perlmutter
lawyer
marc
sherman
and
west
palm
beach
physician
bruce
moskowitz
were
exposed
as
a
kind
of
secret
shadow
government
at
mar-a-lago
with
intrusive
input
into
veterans
affairs
politico
and
propublica
reported
last
year
they
had
no
experience
in
veterans
affairs
none
of
them
even
served
in
the
military
nor
underwent
any
kind
of
approval
process
to
serve
as
de
facto
managers
yet
with
trump's
approval
they
directed
actions
and
criticized
operations
without
any
oversight
they
wasted
valuable
staff
time
in
hundreds
of
pages
of
communications
and
meetings
emails
show
propublica
last
year
obtained
hundreds
of
pages
of
communications
mostly
from
the
three
men
the
crew
emails
reveal
disdainful
attitudes
within
the
department
to
the
trio's
meddling
the
three
men
were
particularly
interested
in
a
billion
technology
contract
for
veterans
hospitals
and
were
instrumental
in
significantly
delaying
it
according
to
politico
according
to
one
email
obtained
by
crew
moskowitz
insisted
on
being
included
in
every
call
involving
va
contracts
one
department
physician
asked
by
a
va
official
to
respond
to
questions
from
one
of
the
triumvirate
called
the
queries
just
ridiculous
they
don't
make
any
sense
and
there
is
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
i'm
just
baffled
the
email
stated
this
is
an
outrage
va
staff
are
being
forced
to
answer
to
mar-a-lago
customers

august

passed
along
demands
to
answer
complex
questions
or
follow
instructions
with
the
explanation
that
it
came
from
a
trump
associate
and
that
responses
would
have
to
be
handled
sensitively
and
with
facts
one
staffer
said
he
considered
a
meeting
with
two
of
the
men
a
grin
and
bear
it
session
another
dismissed
one
of
the
trio
as
just
way
out
of
his
depth
one
member
of
the
department
complained
that
time
was
being
wasted
with
sherman
by
talking
past
each
other
adding
given
marc
doesn't
understand
the
context
of
government
nor
does
he
understand
the
contract
another
complained
of
sherman
not
sure
where
mr
sherman
is
going
with
his
comments
but
our
language
in
the
contract
is
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
our
clinicians
and
various
external
reviews
staff
members
appeared
confused
in
emails
about
the
men's
authority
in
the
department
bruce
moskowitz
will
join
the
call
tomorrow
read
one
email
he
is
a
white
house
adviser
i
don't
know
much
about
him
other
than
he
is
important
one
quipped
about
a

request
you
will
love
this
one
david
shulkin
who
was
veterans
affairs
secretary
at
the
time
was
fired
last
year
after
he
repeatedly
complained
about
the
men
politico
reported
shulkin
would
say
who
the
hell
is
this
person
who
practices
medicine
in
florida
and
has
never
run
a
health
care
system
a
source
told
politico
crew
noted
that
the
influence
of
the
so-called
mar-a-lago
guys
over
va
department
affairs
raises
serious
ethical
red
flags
for
a
number
of
reasons
including
opportunities
to
profit
from
their
involvement
it's
unclear
if
the
men
remain
involved
in
va
operations
they
told
propublica
in
a
joint
statement
last
year
that
their
advice
to
the
va

be
accepted
or
not
at
all
times
we
offered

seeking
nothing
at

in

they
said
in
the
statement
while
we
were
always
willing
to
share
our

we
did
not
