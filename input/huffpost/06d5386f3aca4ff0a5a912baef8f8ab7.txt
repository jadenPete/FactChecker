former
fbi
director
james
comey's
retention
handling
and
dissemination
of
certain
memos
regarding
his
interaction
with
president
donald

violated

policies
and
his
fbi

agreement
the
justice
department's
inspector
general
found
in
a
report
released
thursday
the
report
found
that
comey
violated
fbi
policy
and
the
requirements
of
his
fbi
employment
agreement
when
he
decided
to
disclose
the
contents
of
a
memo
to
the
new
york
times
through
a
friend
a
move
he
made
in
hopes
of
bringing
about
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
from
the
report
he
said
he
viewed
the
issue
as
one
of
incredible
importance
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
told
us
he
felt
that
taking
action
was
something
i
had
to
do
if
i
love
this
country
and
i
love
the
department
of
justice
and
i
love
the
fbi
however
comey's
own
personal
conception
of
what
was
necessary
was
not
an
appropriate
basis
for
ignoring
the
policies
and
agreements
governing
the
use
of
fbi
records
especially
given
the
other
lawful
and
appropriate
actions
he
could
have
taken
to
achieve
his
desired
end
comey
noted
on
twitter
that
the
report
found
no
evidence
that
comey
or
his
attorneys
released
any
of
the
classified
information
contained
in
any
of
the
memos
to
members
of
the
media
i
don't
need
a
public
apology
from
those
who
defamed
me
but
a
quick
message
with
a
sorry
we
lied
about
you
would
be
nice
comey
wrote
on
twitter
but
the
ig
said
that
comey's
actions
were
contrary
to
his
duties
from
the
report
in
a
country
built
on
the
rule
of
law
it
is
of
utmost
importance
that
all
fbi
employees
adhere
to
department
and
fbi
policies
particularly
when
confronted
by
what
appear
to
be
extraordinary
circumstances
or
compelling
personal
convictions
comey
had
several
other
lawful
options
available
to
him
to
advocate
for
the
appointment
of
a
special
counsel
which
he
told
us
was
his
goal
in
making
the
disclosure
what
was
not
permitted
was
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
sensitive
investigative
information
obtained
during
the
course
of
fbi
employment
in
order
to
achieve
a
personally
desired
outcome
