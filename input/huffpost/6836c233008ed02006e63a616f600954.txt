a
year
before

elections
nathaniel
stinnett
vowed
to
raise
an
army
of
environmental
super
voters
to
rival
the
national
rifle
association
his
nonpartisan
environmental
voter
project
ultimately
persuaded
eco-conscious
voters
in
six
states
colorado
florida
georgia
massachusetts
nevada
and
pennsylvania
to
cast
ballots
for
the
first
time
last
year
now
ahead
of
the
election
stinnett
is
doubling
his
effort
targeting
millions
of
untapped
voters
and
adding
six
new
battleground
states
arizona
virginia
new
mexico
north
carolina
new
hampshire
and
maine
we're
not
going
to
let
a
single
environmentalist
stay
home
on
election
day
stinnett
said
to
identify
voters
the
four-year-old
environmental
voter
project
builds
profiles
based
on
the
kind
of
demographic
and
behavioral
data
advertisers
use
then
runs
a
series
of
polls
to
verify
the
data
and
determine
how
likely
voters
are
to
list
environmental
issues
as
their
political
priority
it
then
runs
the
profiles
through
an
algorithm
that
scores
voters
based
on
how
likely
they
are
to
be
super
environmentalists
finally
the
group
weeds
out
people
whose
public
voting
records
show
they
turn
out
for
most
elections
what
remains
is
a
pool
of
registered
voters
who
don't
need
to
be
sold
on
the
realities
of
the
climate
crisis
they
just
need
to
be
persuaded
to
turn
out
on
election
day

in

that's
where
the
environmental
voter
project's
more
than
volunteers
come
in
to
mail
flyers
send
text
messages
and
knock
on
doors
the
group
deliberately
avoids
talking
about
environmental
issues
instead
it
deploys
classic
persuasion
techniques
shaming
voters
for
missing
elections
that
neighbors
cast
ballots
in
reminding
them
when
and
where
the
next
polls
are
and
promising
to
follow
up
we're
not
focused
on
one
election
said
stinnett
a
veteran
campaign
strategist
in
boston
we're
focused
on
changing
the
electorate
next
year
the
environmental
voter
project
is
eyeing
million
new
voters
ahead
of
local
state
and
presidential
primaries
by
the
time
the
general
election
takes
place
in
november
we'll
still
be
targeting
million
environment-first
voters
who've
never
voted
in
a
single
election
before
stinnett
said
we
expect
that
number
to
grow
because
millions
are
expected
to
register
for
the
first
time
he
said
the
group
raised
about
in
last
year
it
hauled
in
over
million
billionaire
jeremy
grantham
the
british
financier
who's
pledged
roughly
billion
to
climate
causes
is
one
of
the
primary
funders
as
grist
reported
last
year
but
about
donors
gave
or
less
each
over
the
past
year
stinnett
said
no
one
is
going
to
confuse
us
with
bernie
sanders
he
said
referring
to
the
democratic
presidential
candidate's
unrivaled
base
of
small
donors
but
this
year
we
are
raising
money
twice
as
fast
as
we
did
last
year
people
are
really
excited
about
this
work
we're
doing
the
expansion
comes
as
the
climate
crisis
is
emerging
as
a
priority
ahead
of
the
election
nearly
candidates
for
public
office
have
disavowed
donations
from
the
fossil
fuel
industry
millions
of
students
are
slated
to
go
on
school
strikes
next
month
to
demand
climate
action
even
avowedly
centrist
candidates
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
are
proposing
multitrillion-dollar
plans
to
slash
planet-heating
emissions
and
overhaul
drinking
water
infrastructure
we're
not
focused
on
one
election
we're
focused
on
changing
the
electorate
environmental

project
founder
nathaniel
stinnett
it's
a
dramatic
reversal
from
the
election
in
which
climate
change
was
virtually
ignored
but
the
shift
comes
in
response
to
mounting
evidence
that
the
cumulative
effects
of
centuries
of
industrial
emissions
are
starting
to
show
fires
are
burning
from
the
arctic
to
the
amazon
to
central
africa
greenland

losing
billions
of

of

plastic
pollution
an
oil
byproduct
is
now
so
widespread
it's
found
in
rain
and
snow
as
of
last
month
of
democrats
and
democratic-leaning
independents
said
climate
change
is
a
major
threat
to
the
country's
well-being
up
from
in
march
according
to
a
pew
research
center
survey
released
this
week
that
compares
with
of
republicans
and
republican-leaning
independents
up
from
in
but
the
amsterdam-based
polling
agency
glocalities
found
of
republicans
agreed
or
strongly
agreed
with
the
statement
i
worry
about
the
damage
humans
cause
the
planet
an
increase
from
that
kind
of
political
sea
change
allowed
the
environmental
voter
project
to
refine
its
model
where
in
past
elections
the
group
targeted
voters
who
listed
the
environment
among
their
top
two
political
priorities
it
now
only
focuses
on
those
who
rank
it
first
we
realized
there
are
now
enough
of
those
people
that
we
can
accurately
identify
them
stinnett
said
if
there
aren't
enough
climate-first
people
it's
hard
to
build
a
model
to
help
you
identify
them
you
have
to
have
a
significant
enough
number
now
we
do
