the
wide
range
of
things
trump's
said
about
gun
policy
over
the
years
president
trump's
contradictory
statements
on
gun
policy
this
month
have
been
confusing
but
his
stance
has
fluctuated
many
times
in
the
last
years
president
donald
trump's
stance
on
gun
policy
has
wavered
in
a
matter
of
weeks
after
back-to-back
mass
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
rocked
the
country
earlier
this
month
trump
called
background
checks
important
and
said
he
wanted
to
keep
guns
away
people
with
rage
or
hate
sick
people
i
don't
want
to
i'm
all
in
favor
of
it
then
he
reportedly
told
national
rifle
association
ceo
wayne
lapierre
on
tuesday
that
he
wasn't
making
any
changes
to
the
background
check
system
according
to
the
atlantic
that
same
day
he
warned
of
gun
control's
slippery
slope
and
said
that
existing
background
checks
were
very
very
strong
though
he
noted
there
were
missing
areas
on
wednesday
trump
jumped
back
to
his
previous
stance
on
background
checks
saying
he
had
an
appetite
for
them
and
that
his
administration
would
be
pursuing
them
trump's
position
on
guns
fluctuated
even
before
his
presidential
campaign
here
are
some
of
the
very
different
things
he
has
said
about
gun
policy
over
the
years
in
trump
supported
an
assault
weapons
ban
and
a
slightly
longer
waiting
period
to
purchase
guns
describing
his
gun
policy
views
in
his
book
the
america
we
deserve
trump
said
he
opposed
gun
control
but
supported
a
ban
on
assault
weapons
a
stance
he'd
reverse
during
his
presidential
campaign
trump
also
suggested
that
a
background
check
should
occur
within
hours
from
the
america
we
deserve
i
generally
oppose
gun
control
but
i
support
the
ban
on
assault
weapons
and
i
also
support
a
slightly
longer
waiting
period
to
purchase
a
gun
with
today's
internet
technology
we
should
be
able
to
tell
within
seventy-two
hours
if
a
potential
gun
owner
has
a
record
the
same
year
trump
said
republicans
walk
the
nra
line
and
refuse
even
limited
restrictions
in
the
america
we
deserve
trump
writes
democrats
want
to
confiscate
all
guns
which
is
a
dumb
idea
because
only
the
law-abiding
citizens
would
turn
in
their
guns
and
the
bad
guys
would
be
the
only
ones
left
armed
the
republicans
walk
the
nra
line
and
refuse
even
limited
restrictions
he
didn't
explain
the
issue
further
in
trump
said
he
was
against
gun
control
because
it
doesn't
work
in
an
interview
for
rolling
stone's
may
issue
trump
said
gun
control
does
nothing
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
bad
guys
he
also
said
he
owned
a
handgun
i'm
against
gun
control
for
the
reason
it
doesn't
affect
the
bad
guys
because
they're
going
to
have
guns
what
kind
of
gun
do
i
have
i'd
rather
not
say
i
have
a
gun
it's
a
handgun
ok

may
in
trump
protested
against
a
new
york
state
law
requiring
universal
background
checks
for
gun
purchases
trump
spoke
briefly
at
a
protest
against
the
safe
act
enacted
by
gov
andrew
cuomo
d
and
noted
that
he
had
his
own
gun
permit
the
times
union
reported
at
the
time
the
safe
act
broadened
requirements
for
background
checks
and
requires
mental
health
professionals
to
report
patients
they
believe
are
dangerous
the
legislation
was
designed
to
prevent
criminals
and
the
dangerously
mentally
ill
from
buying
a
gun
and
strengthened
penalties
for
people
who
use
illegal
guns
according
to
the
state
website
in
trump
said
the
background
check
system
needed
to
be
fixed
but
not
expanded
on
his
campaign
site
in
trump
said
that
gun
and
magazine
bans
are
a
total
failure
he
also
said
that
criminals
won't
go
through
background
checks
to
obtain
firearms
and
blamed
states
for
failing
to
put
criminal
and
mental
health
records
into
the
system
too
many
states
are
failing
to
put
criminal
and
mental
health
records
into
the
system
and
it
should
go
without
saying
that
a
system's
only
going
to
be
as
effective
as
the
records
that
are
put
into
it
what
we
need
to
do
is
fix
the
system
we
have
and
make
it
work
as
intended
what
we
don't
need
to
do
is
expand
a
broken
system
in
trump
said
he
no
longer
supported
banning
assault
weapons
during
a
republican
presidential
debate
in
march
trump
changed
his
stance
on
assault
weapons
when
moderator
bret
baier
said
he
had
previously
supported
a
ban
on
them
i
don't
support
it
anymore
i
do
not
support
the
ban
on
assault
weapons
trump
said
trump
tweeted
in
that
people
on
a
terror
watch
list
should
be
banned
from
buying
guns
in
a
june
tweet
days
after
the
pulse
nightclub
mass
shooting
trump
said
he
was
meeting
with
the
nra
to
discuss
banning
people
on
the
terror
watch
list
from
purchasing
guns
in
the
u.s.
trump
also
noted
his
campaign
was
backed
by
the
nra
i
will
be
meeting
with
the
nra
who
has
endorsed
me
about
not
allowing
people
on
the
terrorist
watch
list
or
the
no
fly
list
to
buy
guns

realdonaldtrump
june
months
later
during
a
presidential
debate
against
hillary
clinton
trump
said
he
agreed
with
the
democrat
that
those
on
a
watch
list
should
be
prohibited
from
obtaining
a
firearm
i
have
the
endorsement
of
the
nra
which
i'm
very
proud
of
these
are
very
very
good
people
and
they
are
protecting
the
second
amendment
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
very
strongly
at
no
fly-lists
and
watch
lists
in
trump
signed
legislation
that
undid
restrictions
on
firearms
for
mentally
impaired
social
security
recipients
shortly
after
taking
office
trump
signed
a
bill
that
undid
obama-era
regulations
that
required
the
social
security
administration
to
report
disabled
adults
who
received
benefits
through
a
representative
due
to
mental
impairment
to
the
fbi's
criminal
background
check
system
in
trump
told
parkland
school
shooting
survivors
that
he
was
going
to
be
very
strong
on
background
checks
after
a
former
student
opened
fire
at
a
high
school
in
parkland
florida
leaving
dead
trump
met
with
student
survivors
parents
and
lawmakers
and
assured
them
that
his
administration
was
going
to
be
very
strong
on
background
checks
we're
going
to
be
doing
very
strong
background
checks
trump
said
very
strong
emphasis
on
the
mental
health
of
somebody
in
early
trump
threatened
to
veto
bills
that
expanded
federal
background
checks
in
february
trump
threatened
to
veto
two
democrat-backed
pieces
of
legislation
that
expanded
federal
background
checks
for
gun
sales
including
purchases
at
gun
shows
and
online
the
trump
administration
argued
that
the
legislation
did
not
protect
gun
owners
second
amendment
rights
and
imposed
burdensome
requirements
on
certain
firearm
purchases
this
month
trump
tried
to
link
background
checks
and
immigration
laws
after
back-to-back
mass
shootings
after
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
and
dayton
in
early
august
that
left
people
dead
trump
said
republicans
and
democrats
needed
to
work
together
for
strong
background
checks
but
added
that
the
proposed
legislation
could
be
combined
with
desperately
needed
immigration
reform
we
cannot
let
those
killed
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
die
in
vain
likewise
for
those
so
seriously
wounded
we
can
never
forget
them
and
those
many
who
came
before
them
republicans
and
democrats
must
come
together
and
get
strong
background
checks
perhaps
marrying

i
think
we
have
to
start
building

again
he
continued
if
you
look
at
the

and
s
so
many
of
these
institutions
were
closed
and
the
people
were
just
allowed
to
just
go
onto
the
streets
that
was
a
terrible
thing
for
our
country
we
have
to
open
up
