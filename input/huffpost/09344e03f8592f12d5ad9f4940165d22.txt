despite
this
grandiose
claim
which
trump
has
repeated
on
several
occasions
congress
has
only
allocated
billion
in
disaster
relief
for
puerto
rico
federal
data
shows
of
that
amount
the
island
has
received
less
than
billion
puerto
rico
is
a
sore
spot
for
trump
he
has
criticized
local
government's
management
of
resources
while
island
leaders
have
slammed
the
president
for
his
handling
of
the
destruction
caused
by

reportedly
opposed
sending
financial

to
the

according
to
the

he
delayed
signing
a
disaster
relief
bill
for
months
that
would
benefit
multiple
u.s.
locales
recovering
from
flooding
hurricanes
wildfires
and

puerto

was
one
of

trump
has

dubbed
himself
as
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
puerto

they
don't
like
to
give
me
the
credit
for
it
but
we
did
a
great
job

i

i've
