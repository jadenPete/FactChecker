elizabeth
warren
and

sanders
duel
for
progressive
hearts
in
new
hampshire
sanders
sees
health
care
as
s
defining
issue
warren
wants
to
tackle
special
interest
influence
and
corruption
in
washington
wolfeboro
n.h.
if
you're
a
progressive
voter
trying
to
figure
out
whether
to
support
bernie
sanders
or
elizabeth
warren
in
the
battle
for
s
democratic
presidential
nomination
don't
expect
them
to
make
the
choice
easy
for
you
elizabeth
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
you
will
make
that
decision
yourself
sanders
said
last
week
at
a
town
hall
here
after
an
attendee
asked
the
vermont
senator
why
voters
should
support
him
over
his
senate
colleague
from
massachusetts
with
whom
he
agrees
on
many
issues
warren
has
made
similar
pledges
not
to
go
after
rivals
in
the
race
particularly
citing
her
friendship
with
sanders
that
began
long
before
i
ever
got
into
politics
but
even
though
the
two
progressive
standard-bearers
share
similar
commitments
to
the
need
for
structural
change
on
several
policy
fronts
they're
approaching
voters
on
the
campaign
trail
with
strikingly
different
messages
during
recent
swings
each
made
in
the
first-in-the-nation
primary
state
of
new
hampshire
for
example
they
detailed
their
plans
to
address
wealth
inequality
the
growing
threat
of
climate
change
and
problems
with
the
nation's
health
care
criminal
justice
and
education
systems
sanders
however
placed
a
far
greater
emphasis
on
the
need
to
lower
health
care
costs
by
instituting
a
single-payer
model
known
as
medicare
for
all
the
issue
dominated
his
stump
speech
at
all
four
events
he
held
in
the
state
where
he
quizzed
supporters
on
the
cost
of
their
insurance
premiums
and
talked
up
his
recent
trip
to
get
insulin
at
a
pharmacy
in
canada
the
renewed
focus
on
his
signature
proposal
is
part
of
an
effort
to
distinguish
himself
from
his
rivals
many
of
whom
have
embraced
his
health
care
plan

of

speaks
to
supporters
at
the
wolfeboro
inn
in
wolfeboro
new
hampshire
last
week
sanders
relentless
focus
on
the
issue
to
me
suggests
that
this
is
something
he
is
just
fundamentally
committed
to
jeremy
mele
a
supporter
from
maine
told
huffpost
at
the
rally
in
wolfeboro
i'm
not
saying
warren
won't
support
people
to
have
health
care
but
it
might
just
mean
it's
not
her
priority
when
she's
in
office
warren
meanwhile
spent
much
more
time
at
her
campaign
events
spotlighting
her
plans
to
fight
the
influence
of
special
interests
in
washington
and
her
proposed
tax
on
the
super-rich
an
idea
sanders
has
also
supported
the
latter
proposal
would
levy
a
percent
tax
on
assets
over
million
and
a
tax
on
assets
over
billion
or
as
she
described
it
at
a
town
hall
gathering
in
franconia
last
week
requiring
those
not
just
at
the
top
but
at
the
top
of
the
top
of
the
top
to
pay
more
in
taxes
to
help
finance
expanded
social
programs
the
point
is
not
to
be
cranky
the
point
is
not
to
say
shame
on
you
warren
said
of
her
wealth
tax
you
built
a
great
fortune
good
for
you
but
you
built
it
at
least
in
part
using
workers
all
of
us
paid
to
educate
an
even
more
striking
difference
in
their
pitch
to
voters
concerns
style
however
sanders
a
known
commodity
in
new
hampshire
his
overwhelming
win
in
the
state's
primary
propelled
his
sustained
but
failed
bid
for
the
nomination
against
hillary
clinton
wasted
no
time
diving
into
problems
he's
been
railing
about
for
decades
he
proudly
cast
himself
as
an
antagonist
to
the
political
establishment
including
the
democratic
party
and
the
media
he
rarely
strayed
into
his
personal
biography
and
seemed
less
comfortable
than
most
white
house
seekers
with
pressing

sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
greets
people
at
a
campaign
event
last
week
in
franconia
new
hampshire
warren's
stump
speech
by
contrast
is
rooted
in
recounting
her
family's
struggles
trying
to
make
ends
meet
in
oklahoma
recalling
stories
about
her
mother
her
aunt
and
her
republican
brothers
she
weaves
a
compelling
narrative
that
struggling
americans
can
easily
identify
with
and
she
seems
to
particularly
enjoy
taking
selfies
with
her
supporters
which
she
refers
to
as
the
fun
part
of
her
campaign
events
she
took
photos
with
attendees
for
over
an
hour
after
a
rally
in
minnesota
this
week
her
strategy
has
resonated
with
voters
warren
has
slowly
inched
up
in
the
polls
to
vie
with
sanders
as
the
leading
rival
to
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
frontrunner
for
the
democratic
nod
who
has
advocated
a
more
moderate
and
incremental
approach
to
governing
she
comes
off
a
little
more
younger
said
neil
brody
a
real
estate
company
owner
from
bethlehem
new
hampshire
who
supported
sanders
in
she's
better
at
explaining
things
she
tells
a
better
story
bernie
just
says
it
twig
notman
a
part-time
nurse
from
vermont
said
she'd
like
to
see
a
warren-sanders
ticket
in
the
general
election
i've
always
liked
bernie
i
voted
for
him
last
time
but
he's
kind
of
past
his
prime
she
said
polls
show
support
for
sanders
and
warren
does
differ
in
some
key
demographic
aspects
despite
their
mutual
appeal
to
progressives
while
he
tends
to
draw
more
lower-income
and
less-educated
people
she
does
better
with
college-educated
voters
sanders
performs
better
with
men
while
warren
does
so
with
women
moreover
her
message
hasn't
resonated
as
well
as
his
with
black
voters

sanders
and
warren
greet
each
other
at
the
start
of
the
democratic
presidential
debate
last
month
in
detroit
more
broadly
sanders
supporters
tend
to
identify
as
independents
or
democratic
socialists
while
those
backing
warren
more
often
self-identified
as
democrats
the
differences
between
their
respective
bases
mean
neither
has
too
much
to
gain
by
going
after
the
other
and
they've
maintained
an
informal
non-aggression
pact
so
far
but
as
the
democratic
race
intensifies
that
stance
is
likely
to
show
signs
of
strain
if
not
dissipate
and
their
more
fervent
and
high-profile
supporters
may
become
less
restrained
as
well
on
monday
for
example
actress
and
activist
susan
sarandon
took
an
apparent
dig
at
warren
as
she
introduced
sanders
at

in
iowa
he
is
not
someone

used

be

said
sarandon
