survivors
of

are
urging
the
government
to
declare
a
national

on

violence
march
for
our
lives
the
youth-run
activist
coalition
has
released
a
sweeping
gun
control
plan
aimed
at
halving
gun
deaths
and
injuries
over
the
next
years
and
dramatically
changing
the
standards
underlying
gun
ownership
in
the
u.s.
the
peace
plan
for
a
safer
america
released
wednesday
comes
just
weeks
after
a
pair
of
mass
shootings
left
people
dead
and
dozens
of
others
injured
in
el
paso
texas
and
dayton
ohio
i
think
similarly
to
a
lot
of
the
country
i'm
in
a
lot
of
pain
right
now
david
hogg
a
co-founder
of
march
for
our
lives
told
the
washington
post
hogg
is
a
survivor
of
the
february
shooting
at
marjory
stoneman
douglas
high
school
in
parkland
florida
seventeen
students
and
faculty
were
shot
to
death
by
a
former
student
and
the
massacre
gave
rise
to
the
massive
student-led
anti-gun-violence
movement
known
as
march
for
our
lives
you
see
these
shootings
on
tv
every
day
and
very
little
happening
around
it
hogg
told
the
post
but
i
think
that
this
plan
is
something
that
we
can
truly
as
a
country
and
as
americans
united
against
violence
and
fighting
for
peace
can
get
behind
the
plan
calls
on
the
government
to
declare
a
national
emergency
around
gun
violence
its
proposals
include
creating
a
national
licensing
and
registry
system
for
gun
owners
banning
assault
weapons
and
instituting
a
gun
buyback
and
disposal
program
the
proposal
also
calls
on
the
federal
election
commission
and
the
irs
to
initiate
investigations
into
the
national
rifle
association
we
call
on
every
presidential
candidate
for
the
election
to
endorse
our
peace
plan
for
a
safer
america
march
for
our
lives
said
in
a
statement
several
of
the
democratic
candidates
have
released
their
own
gun
control
plans
with
similar
measures
sen
cory
booker
d-n
j.
a
contender
released
his
plan
in
may
and
also
proposed
a
national
gun
licensing
program
a
ban
on
high-capacity
weapons
and
bump
stocks
and
an
irs
investigation
of
the
nra
president
donald
trump
who
officially
launched
his
reelection
campaign
last
week
has
gone
back
and
forth
on
gun
policy
after
the
shootings
in
texas
and
ohio
this
month
the
president
said
there
was
a
very
strong
appetite
for
background
checks
on
people
attempting
to
buy
firearms
those
comments
echoed
similar
remarks
he
made
after
the
parkland
shooting
in
which
he
said
he
would
be
strongly
pushing
for
background
checks
and
ending
the
sale
of
bump
stocks
an
accessory
used
in
the
las
vegas
harvest
festival
shooting
that
helps
a
semiautomatic
weapon
mimic
an
automatic
one
i
will
be
strongly
pushing
comprehensive
background
checks
with
an
emphasis
on
mental
health
raise
age
to
and
end
sale
of
bump
stocks
congress
is
in
a
mood
to
finally
do
something
on
this
issue
i
hope
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
february
a
ban
on
bump
stocks
went
into
effect
earlier
this
year
but
trump
has
waffled
on
other
proposals
however
the
president
reportedly
spoke
with
wayne
lapierre
the
nra's
chief
executive
on
tuesday
and
assured
him
that
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
trump
reversed
course
yet
again
on
wednesday
telling
reporters
we're
going
to
be
doing
background
checks
top
democrats
have
focused
their
energy
instead
on
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
who
has
yet
to
put
to
a
vote
a
bipartisan
background
check
bill
that
has
passed
in
the
house
but
languished
in
the
upper
chamber
these
retreats
are
heartbreaking
particularly
for
the
families
of
the
victims
of
gun
violence
senate
minority
leader
chuck
schumer
d-n
y.
wrote
on
twitter
remarking
on
trump's
flip-flopping
on
background
checks
he
added
if
you're
serious
about
action
the
way
forward
is
for
mcconnell
to
put
the
bipartisan
house-passed
background
checks
bill
up
for
a
vote
