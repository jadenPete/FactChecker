the
governor
said
she
doesn't
remember
wearing
blackface
or
the
details
of
the
skit
but
she
also
didn't
deny
her
part
in
it
as
part
of
her
apology
she
released
a
recording
of
a
radio
interview
she
and
her
then-fiance
ben
laravia
gave
in
according
to
the
associated
press
laravia
describes
ivey
who
was
student
body
vice
president
wearing
blue
coveralls
and
black
paint
all
over
her
face
at
a
baptist
student
union
party
the
skit
did
not
require
a
lot
of
talent
as
far
as
verbal
talent
it
did
require
a
lot
of
physical
acting
such
as
crawling
around
the
floor
looking
for
cigar
butts
laravia
said
in
the
recording
his
comments
can
be
heard
at
about
the
mark
below
in
february
the
auburn
plainsman
the
student-run
newspaper
for
auburn
university
uncovered
a
number
of
old
yearbooks
that
included
photos
of
students
wearing
blackface
and
performing
other
racist
acts
the
plainsman
highlighted
one
yearbook
photo
that
showed
ivey's
sorority
alpha
gamma
delta
performing
a
skit
in
blackface
ivey
did
not
appear
in
a
photo
on
that
specific
page
though
her
name
was
listed
on
the
page
and
it
identified
her
as
the
student
government
vice
president
ivey's
media
team
told
the
plainsman
at
the
time
of
its
reporting
that
the
governor
had
never
seen
the
yearbook
photos
in
question
before
and
knows
nothing
about
the
page
ivey
said
thursday
she
has
just
now
been
made
aware
of
the
radio
interview
which
she
also
said
she
didn't
remember
and
took
responsibility
for
her
part
in
the
racist
skit
even
though
ben
is
the
one
on
tape
remembering
the
skit
and
i
still
don't
recall
ever
dressing
up
in
overalls
or
in
blackface
i
will
not
deny
what
is
the
obvious
she
said
as
such
i
fully
acknowledge
with
genuine
remorse
my
participation
in
a
skit
like
that
back
when
i
was
a
senior
in
college
in
response
to
ivey's
statement
alabama
state
rep
john
rogers
a
democrat
told
the
alabama

that
the
governor
needed
to
step
down
if
she
did
that
she
is
insensitive
she
needs
to
step
down
she
needs
to
be
governor

all
people

rep

said
ivey's
apology
will

unless
the

takes
steps
to

racism
and
racial

in
alabama's
education
system
health
