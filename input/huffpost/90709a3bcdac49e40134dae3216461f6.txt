enough
with
the
false
rumors
nikki
haley
has
just
inspired
a
meme
the
former
u.n.
ambassador
did
a
bad
job
of
stopping
the
chatter
but
a
great
job
of
creating
a
meme
nikki
haley
thought
she
was
squashing
rumors
on
wednesday
instead
she
inspired
a
new
meme
the
former
u.n.
ambassador
posted
this
cryptic
and
seemingly
random
tweet
expressing
her
support
for
vice
president
mike
pence
enough

speculated
that
haley
was
referring
to
chatter
in
republican
circles
that
president
donald
trump
might
drop
pence
and
put
her
on
the
ticket
trump
for
his
part
has
insisted
that
pence
will
be
his
running
mate
once
again
of
course
the
tweet
did
more
to
raise
questions
about
the
supposed
false
rumors
than
it
did
to
quash
them
which
some
suspected
was
her
intent
all
along
certain
key
white
house
aides
know
exactly
what
this
is
about
haley
almost
begging
reporters
to
explain
the
