pete
buttigieg
unveils
billion
initiative
on
opioids
mental
health
it's
an
effort
to
treat
mental
illness
as
a
public
health
crisis
and
it's
way
different
from
what
trump
has
been
doing
democratic
presidential
hopeful
pete
buttigieg
on
friday
laid
out
a
proposal
designed
to
combat
america's
opioid
epidemic
while
making
some
of
the
most
sweeping
changes
in
mental
health
care
since
the
shift
from
institutional
to
community-based
care
half
a
century
ago
the
plan
by
buttigieg
who
is
mayor
of
south
bend
indiana
represents
an
effort
to
fight
an
addiction
crisis
that
has
already
taken
nearly
half
a
million
lives
and
has
somewhat
belatedly
become
a
major
topic
of
discussion
in
american
politics
but
buttigieg
wants
to
do
a
lot
more
than
simply
reduce
addiction
and
the
suffering
it
has
brought
to
wide
swaths
of
america
he
also
wants
to
transform
mental
health
care
by
increasing
the
number
of
front-line
mental
health
workers
making
sure
insurance
pays
fully
for
psychiatric
treatments
and
integrating
mental
health
care
into
physical
health
care
more
generally
buttigieg's
overall
goal
advisers
told
huffpost
is
to
attack
mental
health
as
a
public
health
crisis
with
the
federal
government
financing
local
efforts
that
focus
on
prevention
and
detection
as
much
as
treatment
the
total
cost
would
be
billion
over
years
advisers
said
our
plan
breaks
down
the
barriers
around
mental
health
and
builds
up
a
sense
of
belonging
that
will
help
millions
of
suffering
americans
heal
buttigieg
said
in
a
prepared
statement
parts
of
buttigieg's
policy
vision
overlap
heavily
with
what
some
of
his
democratic
rivals
are
proposing
earlier
this
week
sen
kirsten
gillibrand
d-n
y.
unveiled
a
proposal
that
calls
for
some
of
the
same
steps
that
buttigieg's
plan
does
it's
time
for
mental
health
to
be
taken
as
seriously
as
physical
health
gillibrand
wrote
in
a
medium
post
introducing
her
plan
and
although
there
are
some
big
differences
of
scale
and
substance
among
the
candidate
plans
all
would
represent
a
sharp
departure
from
the
policies
of
president
donald
trump
who
has
spent
much
of
his
first
term
undermining
public
programs
that
pay
for
mental
health
treatment
and
reinforcing
stigmas
around
psychiatric
illness
an
agenda
that
experts
endorse
if
successful
buttigieg
vows
his
plan
will
make
sure
that
of
people
who
need
treatment
for
mental
health
problems
or
addiction
get
that
care
a
dramatic
increase
from
today
when
only
a
small
fraction
do
in
the
process
buttigieg
says
his
plan
could
save
a
million
lives
within
a
decade
those
are
lofty
goals
obviously
requiring
not
just
enactment
of
buttigieg's
entire
agenda
but
also
near-flawless
implementation
not
to
mention
a
fairly
heroic
assumption
that
the
multitude
of
programs
buttigieg
wants
to
fund
would
prove
as
effective
as
their
advocates
promise
still
his
general
approach
is
consistent
with
what
experts
have
recommended
for
some
time
today
for
example
the
gold
standard
for
addressing
opioid
addiction
is
medication-assisted
treatment
or
mat
in
which
addiction
patients
take
alternatives
that
satisfy
their
cravings
without
producing
a
high
mat
used
to
be
a
lot
more
controversial
because
critics
said
it
didn't
fully
cure
people
of
their
addictions
but
there's
now
overwhelming
evidence
of
its
effectiveness
to
increase
its
use
buttigieg
would
take
a
variety
of
steps
like
requiring
that
insurance
plans
cover
it
fully
and
enabling
more
front-line
health
care
workers
to
prescribe
it

pete
buttigieg's
proposal
for
opioids
and
mental
health
pulls
from
the
recommendations
experts
have
been
making
for
decades
buttigieg
also
wants
to
increase
the
size
of
the
mental
health
care
workforce
by
investing
in
new
training
slots
and
then
increasing
what
insurance
pays
for
mental
health
services
historically
low
insurance
reimbursements
for
psychiatrists
psychologists
and
other
professionals
has
made
it
difficult
for
people
seeking
mental
health
care
to
get
it
or
at
least
care
that
their
insurance
would
cover
higher
pay
for
providers
isn't
the
only
reimbursement
change
buttigieg
has
in
mind
he
wants
public
programs
to
pay
for
telemedicine
in
which
therapists
provide
care
by
video
connection
and
to
provide
incentives
for
more
integration
of
mental
health
treatment
into
primary
care
he
also
wants
better
enforcement
of
mental
health
parity
rules
including
those
in
the
affordable
care
act
which
mandate
that
private
insurers
cover
mental
and
physical
health
equally
though
the
federal
government
could
make
some
of
these
changes
directly
by
changing
the
way
federal
insurance
programs
work
or
rewriting
regulations
a
big
part
of
buttigieg's
plan
is
to
make
billion
in
grant
money
available
to
local
agencies
the
money
would
be
contingent
upon
the
agencies
demonstrating
with
data
that
their
programs
were
effective
at
reducing
mental
health
incidence
or
severity
buttigieg's
agenda
includes
other
proposals
as
well
and
together
they
would
represent
a
significant
shift
in
the
way
the
u.s.
handles
mental
health
care
moving
it
toward
more
spending
on
treatment
greater
emphasis
on
screening
and
early
detection
more
integration
of
mental
and
physical
health
and
less
stigma
of
mental
illness
taken
together
they
could
add
up
to
the
biggest
changes
since
the
efforts
at
deinstitutionalization
in
the
s
and
s
pete's
plan
is
hopeful
specific
and
comprehensive
andy
slavitt
the
former
obama
administration
health
care
official
told
huffpost
via
email
slavitt
did
not
advise
the
campaign
but
got
a
look
at
the
plan
before
its
release
and
said
buttigieg
turns
the
page
ahead
of
the
current
national
debate
how
to
cover
more
people
and
to
one
of
the
biggest
holes
that
we
have
our
deeply
underfunded
under-resourced
mental
health
care
system
of
course
the
price
tag
for
doing
that
would
be
significant
and
at
least
for
now
the
buttigieg
campaign
isn't
identifying
offsets
but
advisers
noted
that
reforms
of
mental
health
care
even
those
that
require
new
spending
in
the
short
run
can
produce
savings
in
the
long
run
whether
it's
by
promoting
more
integrated
more
efficient
medical
care
or
by
reducing
the
incidence
of
costly
incarceration
right
now
we
are
throwing
a
whole
lot
of
money
at
jails
and
prisons
it's
millions
and
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
a
year
paul
gionfriddo
president
of
mental
health
america
told
huffpost
on
thursday
we
wait
for
a
crisis
until
it's
stage
four
and
respond
inappropriately
through
incarceration
a
clear
contrast
with
trump
mental
health
has
never
gotten
the
kind
of
attention
in
a
presidential
campaign
that
it
is
getting
for
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
has
put
forward
an
opioid
proposal
based
on
legislation
called
the
care
act
that
she
co-sponsored
last
year
and
that
advocates
have
hailed
as
a
model
for
action
it
would
require
billion
in
new
spending
the
same
amount
that
another
candidate
sen
amy
klobuchar
d-minn
is
seeking
with
her
opioid
addiction
proposal
rep
seth
moulton
d-mass
citing
his
experience
with
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
has
introduced
a
mental
health
agenda
of
his
own
and
that's
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
democrats
who
have
sought
to
bolster
insurance
coverage
of
psychiatric
care

sen

introduced

plan
in
her
presidential
campaign
earlier
this

noting
that
upfront

could
come
back
as

in

incarceration
the
contrast
to
the
policies
of

and
some
of
his
republican
allies
in
congress
could
not
be
more
stark
their
ongoing
efforts
to
roll

repeal
the

defund

across
the
country
while
leaving
millions
with
no
way
to
pay
for
addiction
treatment
or
other
forms
of
mental
health
care
and
in
the
wake
of
recent
mass
shootings
trump
has
frequently
pinned
the
blame
on
mental
illness
and
said
the
best
solution
might
be
to
put
more
people
into
institutions
the
presidential
candidates
are
taking
early
identification
and
intervention
around
mental
illness
seriously
and
putting
it
to
the
forefront
of
the
campaign
gionfriddo
said
which
is
a
big
contrast
to
what
we
are
seeing
from
the
president
which
is
waiting
for
crises
to
occur
and
then
putting
people
into
custodial
