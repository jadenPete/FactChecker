trump
targets
ridiculous
right
to
citizenship
for
anyone
born
in
u.s.
this
isn't
the
first
time
the
president
has
said
he
was
looking
to
end
birthright
citizenship
which
is
granted
by
the
th
amendment
president
donald
trump
said
he
was
very
seriously
considering
issuing
an
executive
order
to
make
changes
to
birthright
citizenship
which
some
argue
is
protected
as
a
constitutional
right
and
called
it
ridiculous
when
asked
about
the
issue
outside
of
the
white
house
on
wednesday
trump
criticized
those
who
have
used
birthright
citizenship
to
become
u.s.
citizens
where
you
have
a
baby
on
our
land
you
walk
over
the
border
have
a
baby
congratulations
the
baby
is
now
a
u.s.
citizen
trump
said
we
are
looking
at
birthright
citizenship
very
seriously
he
continued
it's
it's
frankly
ridiculous
trump
moved
on
to
another
question
from
reporters
without
explaining
the
plan
further
according
to
white
house
pool
reports
birthright
citizenship
which
bestows
u.s.
citizenship
on
anyone
born
on
u.s.
soil
is
enshrined
as
a
right
under
the
th
amendment
it
was
ratified
to
grant
citizenship
to
emancipated
slaves
after
the
civil
war
section
of
the
th
amendment
reads
all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
wherein
they
reside
no
state
shall
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
nor
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
concern
over
birthright
citizenship
was
renewed
after
the
trump
administration
announced
wednesday
that
it
was
rolling
out
a
new
set
of
guidelines
that
would
allow
immigration
officials
to
detain
migrant
families
who
cross
the
border
illegally
for
an
indefinite
amount
of
time
the
new
rules
would
supersede
existing
regulations
established
after
a
class-action
lawsuit
known
as
the
flores
settlement
that
limits
the
amount
of
time
that
immigrant
children
can
be
held
in
government
custody
to
days
or
less
trump
has
previously
threatened
to
take
away
birthright
citizenship
as
part
of
his
campaign
promise
to
suffocate
illegal
immigration
into
the
u.s.
last
october
trump
floated
his
plans
to
use
an
executive
order
to
end
birthright
citizenship
for
children
born
in
the
u.s.
in
an
interview
with
axios
trump
wrongly
claimed
that
the
u.s.
was
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
allows
for
birthright
citizenship
in
fact
there
are
at
least
countries
that
grant
citizenship
to
those
born
on
the
country's
soil
when
trump
roused
up
fears
of
ending
birthright
citizenship
last
year
former
president
barack
obama
responded
by
reminding
trump
of
the
constitution
a
president
doesn't
get
to
decide
on
his
own
who's
an
american
citizen
and
who's
not
obama
said
during
a
democratic
campaign
rally
in
florida
that's
not
how
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
works
added
obama
who
once
taught
constitutional
law
at
the
university
of
chicago
that's
not
how
the
bill
of
rights
works
that's
not
how
our
democracy
works
