jay
inslee
climate
candidate
exits
presidential
race
the
washington
state
governor
released
a
hefty
library
of
climate
policies
and
raised
money
from
over
donors
but
failed
to
break
in
the
polls
jay
inslee
dropped
his
bid
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
on
wednesday
night
as
he
looked
unlikely
to
qualify
for
next
month's
debate
it's
become
clear
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
carrying
the
ball
i'm
not
going
to
be
the
president
so
i'm
withdrawing
tonight
from
the
race
inslee
told
msnbc's
rachel
maddow
look
i've
been
fighting
climate
change
for
years
and
i've
never
been
so
confident
of
the
ability
of
america
now
to
reach
critical
mass
to
move
the
ball
i
believe
we
are
going
to
have
a
candidate
to
fight
this
battle
and
inspire
the
people
i
met
across
the
country
the
washington
governor's
exit
ends
what
began
six
months
ago
as
a
quixotic
campaign
centered
on
an
issue
that
candidates
in
the
last
presidential
election
ignored
it
finished
with
a
book-length
stack
of
proposals
that
chart
a
politically
pragmatic
path
to
averting
catastrophic
climate
change
in
the
decades
to
come
we
left
an
open-source
gold
standard
of
what
will
get
us
to
a
cleaner
future
and
really
will
end
our
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
inslee
told
huffpost
by
phone
wednesday
afternoon
it
was
not
just
a
campaign
document
it
was
a
governing
document
and
it
could
be
used
by
anyone
who
ends
up
in
the
white
house
just
hours
before
announcing
the
governor's
plans
to
bow
out
of
the
race
the
inslee
campaign
released
a
page
memo
detailing
a
plan
to
pay
farmers
to
store
carbon
dioxide
in
soil
establish
a
new
federal
research
agency
on
sustainable
agriculture
and
invest
billions
in
rural
renewable
electricity
projects
the
campaign
despite
its
low
polling
did
more
than
draft
a
blueprint
for
a
future
administration
to
slash
planet-heating
emissions
while
inslee's
rivals
barnstormed
early
primary
states
the
governor
toured
areas
of
the
country
ravaged
by
pollution
flooding
and
extreme
weather
offering
his
candidacy
as
a
megaphone
breaking

in
speeches
and
on
the
debate
stage
he
told
stories
of
mobile
homes
in
california
reduced
to
molten
aluminum
and
floodwaters
throwing
small-town
life
in
iowa
into
chaos
he
amplified
the
concept
of
climate
gentrification
and
relayed
tales
of
a
bookstore
owner
resisting
near-daily
offers
to
sell
his
shop
in
miami's
little
haiti
as
real
estate
developers
sought
higher
ground
he
visited
michigan's
most
polluted
zip
code
a
mostly-black
area
of
southern
detroit
three
times
his
emphasis
on
the
climate
crisis
made
it
impossible
for
his
competitors
to
deploy
lackluster
talking
points
such
as
recommitting
to
the
paris
agreement
or
putting
a
price
on
carbon
emissions
we
started
a
bit
of
an
arms
race
among
the
candidates
on
climate
change
inslee
said
i
think
i've
inspired
people
to
be
a
little
bolder
he
also
picked
a
high-profile
fight
with
the
democratic
national
committee
demanding
that
party
officials
host
a
climate
devoted
entirely
to
climate
change
inslee
announced
his
decision
on
thursday
to
run
for
a
third
term
as
the
evergreen
state's
governor
next
year
i
want
to
continue
to
stand
with
you
in
opposing
donald
trump
and
rejecting
his
hurtful
and
divisive
agenda
while
strengthening
and
enhancing
washington
state's
role
as
a
progressive
beacon
for
the
nation
inslee
said
in
a
statement
associated
press
the
clearest
effect
of
jay
inslee's
campaign
might
be
how
he
amplified
activists
calls
for
a
climate
debate
for
inslee
the
climate
crisis
wasn't
a
newfound
passion
or
a
framework
that
added
fresh
urgency
to
his
existing
ideological
themes
as
a
fifth-generation
washingtonian
raised
hiking
in
the
woods
around
seattle
with
his
biology
teacher
dad
inslee
spent
much
of
his
career
in
politics
championing
the
cause
of
cutting
emissions
while
serving
as
a
u.s.
congressman
he
wrote
a
book
calling
for
a
massive
clean-energy
jobs
program
to
combat
global
warming
in
more
than
a
decade
before
the
green
new
deal
would
popularize
that
notion
by
its
end
the
inslee
campaign
forged
what
might
be
considered
the
real
moderate
pathway
for
democrats
a
bona
fide
progressive
who
voted
against
the
iraq
war
in
congress
and
led
the
first
lawsuit
against
the
trump
administration's
ban
on
travelers
from
several
muslim-majority
countries
inslee
assembled
a
package
of
policies
that
credibly
sketched
out
a
sweeping
federal
plan
to
curb
emissions
without
the
political
baggage
of
some
of
his
more
openly
left-wing
competitors
the
campaign
began
informally
in
january
when
inslee
became
one
of
the
first
likely
presidential
candidates
to
swear
off
all
donations
from
oil
gas
and
coal
companies
and
their
executives
by
signing
the
no
fossil
fuel
money
pledge
inslee
made
it
official
in
march
becoming
the
first
major
candidate
in
history
to
run
on
the
single
if
uniquely
all-encompassing
issue
of
human-caused
climate
change
it
was
an
uphill
trek
from
the
start
as
a
governor
inslee
was
barred
from
transferring
money
from
his
statewide
reelection
coffers
to
his
presidential
campaign
that
put
him
at
a
fundraising
disadvantage
to
the
sitting
members
of
congress
already
dominating
the
race
with
fluid
federal
campaign
accounts
and
national
name
recognition
then
there
was
the
challenge
of
running
on
just
one
issue
poll
after
poll
showed
americans
particularly
democratic-leaning
voters
more
concerned
than
ever
before
about
the
planet's
irreversible
warming
but
as
the
green
new
deal
emerged
as
a
progressive
clarion
call
for
a
fairer
future
economy
the
trump
administration's
brutality
at
the
border
and
so-called
pocketbook
issues
like
health
care
diverted
attention
from
a
crisis
that
while
urgent
felt
easy
to
procrastinate
on
as
a
result
poll
after
poll
showed
inslee
barely
scraping
at
an

the
governor
seemed
to
be
pleading
as
the
environmental
newswire

put
it

his
candidacy
inslee
was
undeterred
while

and
bernie
sanders

pumped
out
grand
proposals
to
cancel
student

or

inslee

a
senior
adviser
and
longtime
friend

this
can't
be

with
a
bumper

inslee
said
the
results
were
impressive
in
may
the
campaign
released
an
ambitious
proposal
to
eliminate
emissions
from
the
electrical
sector
by
nearly
two
weeks
later
inslee
unveiled
a
blockbuster
trillion
plan
to
zero
out
nearly
all

the
plans
kept
coming
inslee
declared
war
on
the
oil

and
coal
industries
with
an
word
freedom
from
fossil

plan
he
vowed
to
block
right-to-work
laws
that
hurt
union
membership
and
set
a
per
hour
minimum
wage
for
clean-energy
jobs
under
his
american
dream
plan
he
promised
to
take
in
historic
levels
of
immigrants
and
refugees
fleeing
climate
change-ravaged
nations
closer
to
the
equator
as
part
of

document
jay
inslee
inslee's
debate
performance
received
mixed
reviews
at
june's
first
round
of
debates
in
miami
inslee
struggled
to
claim
airtime
and
seemed
focused
on
making
the
case
for
candidacy
outside
his
primary
issue
he
touted
his
record
as
a
governor
and
congressman
to
make
the
case
for
himself
as
the
progressive
with
the
executive
experience
to
accomplish
the
goals
warren
and
sanders
set
some
complained
he
veered
too
far
from
his
climate
message
inslee
seemed
to
take
the
critiques
to
heart
at
july's
debate
in
detroit
the
governor
made
an
impassioned
plea
to
scrap
the
filibuster
a
senate
procedure
requiring
a
vote
supermajority
to
overcome
and
depicted
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
r-ky
as
the
biggest
obstacle
to
serious
climate
legislation
inslee
sparred
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
front-runner
in
the
polls
poking
holes
in
his
climate
proposal
the
performance
propelled
inslee's
biggest
fundraising
haul
and
won
him
new
fans
including
some
who
found
his
jockish
looks
new
haircut
and
clark
kent
glasses
titillating
on
monday
the
campaign
hit
the
donor
threshold
the
dnc
set
for
the
september
debate
but
the
dnc
has
also
required
candidates
to
reach
in
at
least
four
qualified
polls
the
clearest
effect
of
inslee's
campaign
might
be
how
he
amplified
activists
calls
for
a
climate
debate
as
his
policy
shop
pulled
late-nighters
inslee
publicly
battled
dnc
chair
tom
perez
demanding
the
party
schedule
a
televised
debate
where
candidates
only
discussed
their
climate
policies
after
large
protests
at
both
debates
the
dnc
relented
and
promised
this
week
to
vote
on
a
resolution
to
approve
such
an
event
it
looks
unlikely
to
pass
but
cnn
and
msnbc
have
already
scheduled
forums
on
climate
change
that
most
of
the
major
candidates
are
expected
to
attend
inslee
will
return
to
washington
with
a
newfound
appreciation
for
the
threats
the
state
has
yet
to
face
he
could
now
leverage
his
national
profile
to
more
aggressively
advocate
on
climate
change
the
u.s.
climate
alliance
the
bipartisan
club
he
helped
found
in
for
states
vowing
to
maintain
the
paris
agreement's
goals
offers
one
possible
avenue
he
looks
likely
to
ramp
up
his
own
efforts
in
the
evergreen
state
washington's
state
supreme
court
is
expected
to
rule
in
the
coming
months
on
whether
inslee
has
the
power
as
governor
to
put
a
cap
on
carbon
emissions
if
the
court
decides
in
his
favor
it
could
open
the
door
to
a
slew
of
new
executive
orders
to
cut
pollution
inslee
declined
to
endorse
any
of
his
rivals
but
said
he
wouldn't
rule
it
out
in
the
months
ahead
he
said
the
money
he
raised
will
go
to
paying
off
the
campaign's
expenses
if
there's
anything
left
over
he
said
he
plans
to
donate
it
to
youth-led
climate
efforts
like
sunrise
movement
or
the
school
strike
push
the
high
point
of
his
campaign
inslee
said
was
protesting
outside
the
united

in
new

city
with
teen
activist
alexandria

who
has
spent
