taylor
swift
trump
is
gaslighting
the
american
public
the
pop
star
told
the
guardian
she
thinks
the
president
believes
america
is
an
autocracy
there's
a
very
good
possibility
taylor
swift
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
donald
trump's
next
twitter
rant
after
she
accused
him
of
changing
the
country's
direction
for
the
worse
the
singer
celebrated
the
release
of
her
new
album
lover
in
part
by
calling
out
the
president
as
a
would-be
autocrat
swift
told
the
guardian
that
she
feels
trump
and
his
administration
are
gaslighting
the
american
public
into
being
like
if
you
hate
the
president
you
hate
america
she
also
accused
trump
of
not
believing
in
one
of
the
country's
core
beliefs
we're
a
democracy
at
least
we're
supposed
to
be
where
you're
allowed
to
disagree
dissent
debate
she
said
i
really
think
that
he
thinks
this
is
an
autocracy
swift's
willingness
to
speak
out
against
the
current
administration
is
a
change
from
when
she
did
not
officially
endorse
either
trump
or
hillary
clinton
for
president
it's
a
decision
she
told
the
paper
she
made
at
the
time
because
she
was
going
through
a
period
of
personal
turbulence
i
was
just
trying
to
protect
my
mental
health
not
read
the
news
very
much
go
cast
my
vote
tell
people
to
vote
she
said
i
just
knew
what
i
could
handle
and
i
knew
what
i
couldn't
i
was
literally
about
to
break
previously
swift
said
she
worried
that
endorsing
clinton
might
be
a
liability
for
the
candidate
but
now
she
feels
really
remorseful
for
not
officially
not
doing
so
things
are
different
now
