trump's
latest

on

likely

hit
consumers
directly
for
the
first
time

war
american
households
face
price
increases
washington
ap
president
donald
trump's
latest
round
of
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
is
likely
to
deliver
a
direct
hit
on
many
consumers
who
were
largely
spared
from
higher
prices
in
his
previous
rounds
of
import
taxes
beginning
sunday
the
u.s.
government
will
begin
collecting
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
imports
items
ranging
from
smartwatches
and
tvs
to
shoes
diapers
sporting
goods
and
meat
and
dairy
products
for
the
first
time
since
trump
launched
his
trade
war
american
households
face
price
increases
because
many
u.s.
companies
say
they'll
be
forced
to
pass
on
to
customers
the
higher
prices
they'll
pay
on
chinese
imports
for
more
than
a
year
the
world's
two
largest
economies
have
been
locked
in
a
high-stakes
duel
marked
by
trump's
escalating
import
taxes
on
chinese
goods
and
beijing's
retaliatory
tariffs
the
two
sides
have
held
periodic
talks
that
seem
to
have
met
little
progress
despite
glimmers
of
potential
breakthroughs
all
the
while
they've
imposed
tariffs
on
billions
of
each
other's
products
in
a
rift
over
what
analysts
say
is
beijing's
predatory
tactics
in
its
drive
to
become
the
supreme
high-tech
superpower
american
consumers
have
so
far
been
spared
the
worst
of
it
the
trump
administration
had
left
most
everyday
household
items
off
its
tariff
list
valued
at
billion
in
chinese
products
so
far
and
instead
targeted
industrial
goods
that's
about
to
change
they're
on
they're
on
trump
said
friday
about
the
new
tariffs
that
are
set
to
kick
in
at
a
m
sunday
under
the
new
schedule
of
the
consumer
goods
americans
buy
from
china
will
face
his
import
taxes
up
from
now
that
isn't
all
higher
tariffs
are
set
to
kick
in
for
another
batch
of
chinese
products
billion
worth
on
dec
by
then
roughly
of
made-in-china
consumer
goods
imported
to
the
united
states
will
be
taxed
according
to
calculations
by
chad
bown
of
the
peterson
institute
for
international
economics
overall
trump's
trade
war
will
have
raised
the
average
tariff
on
chinese
imports
from
in
before
the
hostilities
began
to
the
bottom
line
is
that
for
the
first
time
trump's
trade
war
is
likely
to
directly
raise
prices
for
a
lot
of
household
budget
items
like
clothing
shoes
toys
and
consumer
electronics
bown
wrote
in
an
report
for
months
trump
who
famously
declared
that
trade
wars
are
easy
to
win
falsely
claimed
that
china
itself
paid
the
tariffs
and
that
they
left
americans
unscathed
in
fact
u.s.
importers
pay
the
tariffs
they
must
make
a
high-risk
decision
whether
to
absorb
the
higher
costs
themselves
and
accept
lower
profits
or
pass
on
their
higher
costs
to
their
customers
and
risk
losing
business
this
has
become
an
ever-more-difficult
decision
after
years
of
ultra-low
inflation
consumers
have
grown
more
resistant
to
price
hikes
especially
when
they
can
easily
compare
prices
online
for
household
products
and
choose
the
lowest-price
options
for
that
reason
many
retailers
may
choose
not
to
impose
the
cost
of
trump's
higher
tariffs
on
their
customers
and
the
higher
costs
u.s.
importers
face
could
be
offset
somewhat
by
the
declining
value
of
china's
currency
which
has
the
effect
of
making
its
products
somewhat
less
expensive
in
the
united
states
still
the
prices
of
certain
goods
will
cost
americans
more
trump
tacitly
acknowledged
this
a
few
weeks
ago
by
announcing
a
delay
in
his
higher
tariffs
on
billion
in
imports
until
dec
to
keep
them
from
squeezing
holiday
shoppers
even
before
the
december
tariffs
though
of
shoes
and
of
textiles
and
clothing
imported
from
china
were
to
be
hit
by
trump's
tariffs
according
to
peterson's
bown
and
not
even
counting
the
increase
from
to
that
trump
announced
for
his
new
tariffs
a
week
ago
j.p.
morgan
had
estimated
that
his
import
taxes
would
cost
the
average
household
roughly
a
year
the
story
that
holiday
goods
were
given
a
reprieve
is
fake
news
said
stephen
lamar
of
the
american
apparel
and
footwear
association
overall
the
september
and
december
tariffs
will
force
americans
to
pay
an
extra
billion
a
year
for
shoes
and
boots
according
to
a
footwear
trade
group
retailers
engaged
for
a
battle
for
survival
with
amazon
and
other
e-commerce
rivals
are
bracing
for
the
worst
macy's
raised
an
alarm
when
it
reported
earnings
in
august
in
may
trump
had
raised
separate
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
from
to
in
response
macy's
tried
to
raise
prices
of
some
items
on
the
hit
list
luggage
housewares
furniture
but
according
to
ceo
jeff
gennette
customers
just
said
no
some
retailers
are
trying
to
force
their
suppliers
to
eat
the
higher
costs
so
they
won't
have
to
raise
prices
for
shoppers
target
confirmed
to
the
associated
press
that
it
warned
suppliers
that
it
won't
accept
cost
increases
arising
from
the
china
tariffs
some
small
retailers
are
even
more
vulnerable
any
cost
increase
puts
us
in
a
tough
place
said
jennifer
lee
whose
family
owns
the
footprint
shoe
store
in
san
francisco
it
makes
it
tough
for
business
owners
because
we
will
have
to
take
a
hit
on
our
margins
but
it
will
also
be
difficult
for
us
to
pass
it
on
to
our
shoppers
albert
chow
who
owns
great
wall
hardware
in
san
francisco
said
he's
already
raised
prices
on
some
chinese-made
products
because
an
earlier
round
of
tariffs
led
his
suppliers
to
raise
prices
to
i
will
try
to
keep
the
prices
down
for
as
long
as
i
can
chow
said
but
at
some
point
when
the
tariffs
are
just
too
much
we
have
to
eventually
raise
the
prices
and
then
it
goes
down
to
the
end
user
the
customer
what's
frustrating
for
retailers
is
that
consumers
might
otherwise
be
in
an
exuberant
mood
this
holiday
season
for
most
americans
their
jobs
are
safe
and
their
wages
are
rising
unemployment
is
near
a
half-century
low
yet
the
economy
itself
looks
increasingly
fragile
growth
is
slowing
as
the
global
economy
weakens
and
trump's
mercurial
approach
to
trade
policy
imposing
delaying
re-imposing
import
taxes
via
tweet
makes
it
nearly
impossible
for
companies
to
decide
on
suppliers
factory
sites
and
new
markets
so
they
delay
investments
further
straining
the
economy
we
worry
about
the
average
family
in
this
country
paying
even
more
annually
because
of
the
impact
of
tariffs
said
myron
brilliant
head
of
international
affairs
at
the
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
we
worry
about
what
it
means
for
business
confidence
business
certainty
and
investment
