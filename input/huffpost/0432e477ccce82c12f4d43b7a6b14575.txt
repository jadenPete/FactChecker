to
direct

robert
mueller's
russia
investigation
away
from
the
trump
campaign
whether
the
white
house
will
seek
to
block
the
testimony
of
porter
and
dearborn
is
not
clear
as
it
has
that
of

counsel
don

one-time
trump

porter
who

secretary
appeared
in
mueller's
page
investigation
report
as
a
witness
to
an
episode
involving
former
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
democrats
view
the
sessions
and
mcgahn
episodes
as
evidence
that
trump
is
guilty
of
obstructing
justice
mcgahn
told
mueller
that
trump
repeatedly
instructed
him
to
have
the
special
counsel
removed
and
then
asked
him
to
deny
having
been
so
instructed
when
news
of
the
action
emerged
in
press
reports
mcgahn
did
not
carry
out
either
instruction
according
to
the
mueller
report
trump
turned
to
porter
to
pressure
mcgahn
into
writing
a
letter
of
denial
if
he
doesn't
write
a
letter
then
maybe
i'll
have
to
get
rid
of
him
the
mueller
report
quotes
trump
as
telling
porter
the
report
said
porter
recalled
that
the
president
referred
to
mcgahn
as
a
lying
bastard
trump
also
asked
porter
to
stay
in
touch
with
former
associate
attorney
general
rachel
brand
whom
porter
knew
as
a
possible
replacement
for
sessions
after
the
attorney
general
recused
himself
from
the
russia
probe
and
refused
trump's
demands
that
he
reverse
his
decision
in
asking
him
to
reach
out
to
brand
porter
understood
the
president
to
want
to
find
someone
to
end
the
russia
investigation
or
fire
the
special
counsel
although
the
president
never
said
so
explicitly
the
mueller
report
said
porter
left
the
white
house
in
february
after

of
domestic
abuse
