immigration
status
trump
pardoned
him
a
month
later
saying
that
after
fifty
years
of
admirable
service
to
our

was
a
worthy
candidate

proclaimed
himself
america's
toughest
sheriff

an
immigration
crusader

faced
both
a

opposition
campaign

criminal
contempt

were
issued
old-fashioned
striped
jumpsuits
and
given
pink
underwear
the
facility
was
shut
down
by
penzone
in
who
called
it
more
of
a
circus
than
a
jail
the
last
four
years

proven
to
be
a
time
of
lost
opportunities

continue
the
kind
of
tough
policing

county
