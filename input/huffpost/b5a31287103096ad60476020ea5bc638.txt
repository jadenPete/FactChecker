just
two
days
before

new

records
show
opening
a

in
what
could
be
a
long
battle
over

the

first
reported
by

raised
new
questions
about
epstein's
final
days
inside
the
metropolitan
correctional
center
where
he
was
awaiting
trial
on
federal
sex
trafficking
and
conspiracy
charges
epstein
signed
the
document
aug
less
than
hours
later
he
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
prompting
an
investigation
that
has
cast
a
harsh
light
on
staffing
shortages
at
the
manhattan
detention
center
prosecutors
on
monday
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
against
epstein
but
have
said
they
are
considering
charging
others
with
facilitating
his
alleged
abuse
of
dozens
of
girls
the
filing
of
the
will
meanwhile
had
been
closely
followed
by
lawyers
representing
women
who
claim
they
were
sexually
abused
by
epstein
when
they
were
teenagers
and
recruited
into
his
residences
to
provide
him
massages
several
attorneys
vowed
to
go
after
his
assets
even
if
the
will
had
named
beneficiaries
as
epstein's
death
means
there
will
be
no
trial
on
the
criminal
charges
against
him
one
woman
filed
suit
against
the
estate
last
week
claiming
epstein
repeatedly
raped
her
when
she
was
a
teenager
give
his
entire

to
his

the
only
justice
they
