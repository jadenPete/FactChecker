crackdown
justice
department
report
shows
that
arrests
of
foreign
nationals
spiked
in
but
of
those
arrests
were
related
to
immigration
not
drugs
or
violent
crime
people
who
aren't
u.s.
citizens
made
up
of
all
federal
arrests
in
though
the
majority
of
these
arrests
were
for
nonviolent
crimes
according
to
a
justice
department
report
published
this
week
the
report
showed
that
of
those
arrests
were
connected
with
immigration
offenses
or
were
immigration-related
not
violent
crimes
or
drug
trafficking
as
president
donald
trump
has
claimed
u.s.
citizens
were
arrested
at
higher
rates
for
offenses
involving
drugs
violence
or
fraud
the
statistics
reflect
trump's
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
the
administration's
efforts
to
deter
immigration
have
led
to
the
separation
of
tens
of
thousands
of
migrants
children
from
their
families
and
forced
more
than
migrants
into
detention
centers
the
report

published

more
troops
being
sent
to
the
southern
border
to
stop
the
attempted
invasion
of
illegals
through
large
caravans
into
our
country
we
have
stopped
the
previous
caravans
and
we
will
stop
these
also
with
a
wall
it
would
be
soooo
much
easier
and
less
expensive
being
built
donald

realdonaldtrump
january
throughout
his
presidential
campaign
and
presidency
trump
has
referred
to
immigration
from
central
america
as
an
invasion
of
the
u.s.
and
described
migrants
broadly
as
drug
dealers
rapists
and
violent
criminals
but
the
data
in
the
doj
report
shows
that
more
u.s.
citizens
were
arrested
than
foreign
nationals
for
violent
offenses
drug
offenses
and
weapon
offenses
in
according
to
the
data
noncitizens
were
arrested
at
far
lower
rates
than
u.s.
citizens
for
all
offense
categories
listed
in
the
report
with
the
exception
of
immigration-related
offenses

department
of
justice
report
on
federal
arrests
in
that's
why
immigration
activists
and
many
democratic
presidential
candidates
have
called
to
decriminalize
illegal
border
crossings
presidential
hopeful
juli
n
castro
one
of
the
first
to
publicly
speak
on
decriminalization
proposed
to
make
illegal
border
crossings
a
civil
offense
instead
of
a
criminal
offense
for
undocumented
immigrants
he
blames
the
trump
administration
for
using
border
crossings
as
a
reason
to
criminalize
migrants
detain
them
and
separate
families
the
data
also
shows
that
the
arrests
of
noncitizens
over
immigration
offenses
rose
in
years
from
to
in
the
span
of
one
year
from

the
