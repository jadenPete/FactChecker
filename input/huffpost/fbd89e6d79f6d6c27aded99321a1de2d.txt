anti-semitic
attack

very
disloyal
to

democrats
and
jewish
leaders
railed
against
trump's
use
of
the
dual
loyalty
trope
president
donald
trump
on
wednesday
doubled
down
on
his
anti-semitic
attacks
against
jewish
democrats
claiming
anyone
who
votes
for
a
democrat
is
disloyal
to
israel
and
the
jewish
people
if
you
vote
for
a
democrat
you're
being
disloyal
to
jewish
people
and
you're
being
very
disloyal
to
israel
the
president
told
reporters
outside
the
white
house
only
weak
people
would
say
anything
other
than
that
trump
then
appeared
to
conflate
people
who
criticize
the
israeli
government
with
anti-semites
disagreeing
with
the
actions
and
policies
of
the
israeli
government
does
not
constitute
anti-semitism
or
hostility
toward
jews
as
the
anti-defamation
league
has
pointed
out
in
my
opinion
the
democrats
have
gone
very
far
away
from
israel
he
said
video
me
to
whom
are
american
jews
being
disloyal
by
voting
for
democrats
realdonaldtrump
i
have
been
responsible
for
a
lot
of
great
things
for

but

jews
are

statement

comments
he
made
a
day
earlier
while
railing
against
democratic
reps
rashida
tlaib
of
michigan
and
ilhan
omar
of
minnesota
two
of
the
israeli
government's
sharpest
critics
in
congress
i
think
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
i
think
it
shows
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
trump
said
tuesday
democrats
and
jewish
leaders
were
quick
to
condemn
the
president
for
invoking
the
anti-semitic
dual
loyalty
trope
which
accuses
jewish
americans
of
having
dual
loyalties
to
the
u.s.
and
israel
nearly
of
jewish
voters
in
the
u.s.
voted
democratic
in
the
midterm
elections
according
to
the
pew
research
center
we
are
sick
and
tired
of
trump's
repeated
use
of
anti-semitic
tropes
and
his
inciting
of
hate
and
violence
against
jews
the
jewish
democratic
council
of
america
tweeted
wednesday
the
jewish
community
is
less
safe
today
because
of
donald
trump
trump
told
reporters
wednesday
that
he
hasn't
heard
anyone
call
his
claim
anti-semitic
his
attacks
on
jewish
democrats
follow
israel's
decision
to
bar
tlaib
and
omar
from
visiting
the
country
at
trump's
behest
the
freshmen
lawmakers
who
last
year
became
the
first
muslim
women
elected
to
congress
had
planned
to
travel
to
the
west
bank
and
east
jerusalem
this
month
but
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
announced
last
week
that
they
would
not
be
allowed
in
because
they
support
the
pro-palestinian
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
movement
trump
who
has
a
history
of
making
anti-semitic
comments
has
falsely
accused
tlaib
and
omar
of
being
anti-semites
and
pro-terrorist
because
of
their
support
for
palestinian
rights
and
criticism
of
netanyahu
earlier
wednesday
the
president
quoted
in
a
tweet
newsmax
tv
host
wayne
allyn
root
a
known
conspiracy
theorist
who
claimed
israelis
love
trump
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
and
the
second
coming
of
god
jews
do
not
believe
in
a
second
coming
thank
you
to
wayne
allyn

for
the
very
nice
words
trump
wrote
in
his
tweet
wow
thank
you
to
wayne
allyn
root
for
the
very
nice

president
trump
is
the
greatest
president
for

for
israel
in
the
history
of
the
world
not
just
america
he
is
the
best
