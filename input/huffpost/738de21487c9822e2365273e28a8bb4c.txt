the

a
judge
has
temporarily
blocked
one
of
the
country's
most
restrictive
abortion
laws
from
going
into
effect
in
missouri
the
next
day
saying
a
lawsuit
over
the
statute's
constitutionality
needs
to
play
out
before
the
state
can
enforce
it

filed
over
the
state's
ban
on

in
his
ruling
sachs
said
he
exercises
caution
when
delaying
a
state
law
but
that
the
legislation
seems
designed
as
a
protest
against
supreme
court
rulings
against
such
abortion
bans
however
formulated
the
legislation
on
its
face
conflicts
with
the
supreme
court
ruling
that
neither
legislative
nor
judicial
limits
on
abortion
can
be
measured
by
specified
weeks
of
development
of
a
fetus
he
said
it
is
thus
highly
likely
he
continued
that
the
listed
weekly
time
limits
on
abortions
will
be
ruled
invalid
in
the
final
judgment
in
this
case
breaking
a
district

these

were

the

sachs
said
he
made
his
decision
after

the
irreparable
harm
the
ban
could
have
on
women
in
missouri
one
of
six
states
with
only

a

said
through

she
was
referencing
research
showing
that
black
women's
risks
during

are
higher
due
to
lower
access
to

health
care
and
a

for

to
dismiss
their
