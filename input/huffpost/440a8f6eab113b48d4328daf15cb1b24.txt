said
saumya

director

and
campaign
manager

all
on
the
line
the

we

ground
up
right
now
obama
said
in
a
statement
obama
has
been
involved
in
efforts
to
limit
excessive
partisan
gerrymandering
since
leaving
office
last
year
he
folded
his
political
group
organizing
for
action
into
the
ndrc
a
redistricting-focused
group
led
by
eric
holder
who
served
as
attorney
general
for
most
of
obama's
presidency
the
redistricting
process
which
takes
just
once
per
decade
is
expected
to
be
a
brutal
brawl
for
partisan
advantage
the
united
states
supreme
court
ruled
in
june
that
there
were
no
constitutional
limits
on
how
severely
states
could
manipulate
district
lines
to
benefit
political
parties
for
decades
redistricting
in
many
places
has
been
done
behind
closed
doors
with
lawmakers
quietly
negotiating
deals
to
get
the
districts
they
want
emails
from
lawmakers
made
public
in
litigation
in
wisconsin
michigan
and
ohio
among
other
places
have
shed
light
on
just
how
unsavory
those
negotiations
are
in
michigan
for
example

advocates
have
long
struggled
to
get
the
public
interested
in
redistricting
seen
as
a
wonky
boring
and
complicated
issue
but
obama
and
ndrc's
decision
to
focus
on
the
issue
is
a
signal
in
itself
of
how
the
issue
has
exploded
in
recent
years
in
republicans
recognized
the
potential
to
use
the
redistricting
process
to
lock
in
their
political
advantage
for
a
decade
and
successfully
executed
a
targeted
campaign
to
do
just

mocked
the
new
effort
in
a
tweet
the
group
recently
sued
to
block
a
new
independent
panel
in
michigan
from
drawing
district
lines
the
ndrc
has
dismissed
the
gop-led
criticism
noting
that
it
has
championed
proposals
with
bipartisan
support
i'm
not
really
that
focused
on
what
the
nrrt
is
saying
about
us
or
our
program
narechania
said
we
are
hyperfocused
on
building
a
fair
process
and
making
sure
that
we
are
concentrating
on
places
where
redistricting
reform
gives
power
back
to
the
people
not
to
politicians
not
to
the
folks
who
are
camped
out
in
lobbyist
offices
who
are
drawing
the
lines
in
secret
the
whole
point
of
all
on
the
line
is
to
take
this
process
and
make
it
as
transparent
as
possible
and
if
transparency
is
something
that
folks
are
afraid
of
then
i
think
the
question
is
why
is
that
