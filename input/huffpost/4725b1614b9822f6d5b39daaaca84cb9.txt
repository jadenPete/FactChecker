he
would
get

that

would
abolish
the

one
small
part

the

like
ice
the
first
question
you
asked

sanders
responded
so

have
protection
of
our
borders
and
you
need
people
to
do
that
on
whether
he
supports
abolishing
ice

calls
for

the
current
disastrous
system

not
for
open
borders
we

the
question
of
whether
to
abolish
ice
has
become
somewhat
of
a
litmus
test
among
democratic
presidential
candidates
sanders
comments
saturday
mark
his
strongest
statement
against
shutting
down
the
agency
to
date
new

city
mayor
bill

blasio
and
miramar
florida
mayor
wayne
messam
are
the
only
two
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
who
have
called
for
ice
to
be
abolished
sanders
has
previously
called
for
the
restructuring
of
the
immigration
enforcement
agency
and
voted
against
establishing
ice
and
the
department
of
homeland
security
when
they
were
proposed
over
years
ago
ice
has
become
a
deportation
and
detention
machine
sanders
said
in
july
and
i
would
fundamentally
restructure
the
agency
as
well
as
all
the
agencies
that
currently
enforce
our
immigration
laws
to
create
a
humane
and
rational
immigration
system
with
independent
oversight
