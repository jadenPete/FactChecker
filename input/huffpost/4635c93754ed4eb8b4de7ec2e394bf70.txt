says
michigan
panel
to
limit
partisan
gerrymandering
discriminates
against
them
it's
particularly
rich
that
republicans
are
claiming
that
the
commission
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
partisan
affiliation
one
expert
said
republicans
in
michigan
filed
a
second
federal
lawsuit
thursday
challenging
a
newly
created
independent
redistricting
commission
arguing
that
the
panel's
restrictions
limiting
the
partisan
affiliation
of
commissioners
violate
the
u.s.
constitution
michigan
voters
overwhelmingly
approved
a
constitutional
amendment
last
fall
that
gives
a
person
commission
the
power
to
draw
congressional
and
state
legislative
districts
the
panel
has
four
republicans
four
democrats
and
five
members
unaffiliated
with
either
party
in
an
effort
to
limit
partisanship
on
the
panel
there
are
restrictions
on
who
can
serve
for
example
a
commissioner
can't
have
run
or
held
elected
office
within
the
last
six
years
or
served
as
an
officer
or
member
of
a
political
party
a
commissioner
also
can't
be
a
parent
child
or
spouse
of
anyone
who
would
be
ineligible
to
sit
on
the
panel
in
the
new
lawsuit
filed
in
grand
rapids
the
state
republican
party
its
chairwoman
and
four
other
people
affiliated
with
the
gop
say
those
restrictions
violate
the
first
and
th
amendments
and
infringe
on
their
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association
the
proposal
usurps
the
role
of
political
parties
in
selecting
their
nominees
for
partisan
public
office
and
in
the
case
of
the
michigan
republican
party
places
that
responsibility
instead
in
the
hands
of
a
highly
partisan
elected
official
of
the
opposite
political
party
lawyers
wrote
in
the
filing
at
the
same
time
the
proposal
penalizes
applicants
who
affiliate
with
one
of
the
two
major
political
parties
by
allocating
a
minority
of
seats
on
the
commission
to
each
of
those
pools
of
applicants
the
u.s.
supreme
court
handed
republicans
a
significant
victory
in

when
it
said
federal
courts
can't
strike
down
gerrymandered
districts

partisan
grounds

opinion

chief
justice
john
roberts
wrote
that
states
could
still
act
on
their
own
to
restrict
excessive
partisan
gerrymandering
roberts
specifically
pointed
to
michigan
as
an
example
where
this
was
possible

supreme
court
chief

john

pointed
to
gerrymandering
reform
in
michigan
as
an
example
of
how
states
could
act
to
rein
in
excessive
partisanship
in
redistricting
the
grassroots
effort
to
create
the
commission
started
with
a
facebook
post
after
the
election
by
katie
fahey
a
michigan
woman
who
had
never
worked
on
a
political
campaign
republicans
unsuccessfully
tried
to
keep
the
measure
from
going
on
the
ballot
in
but
it
ultimately
passed
with
more
than
of
the
statewide
vote
activists
have
hailed
the
effort
as
an
example
of
how
to
rein
in
partisan
gerrymandering
today's
new
lawsuit
by
the
republican
party
which
orchestrated
a
gerrymander
of
historical
proportions
in
to
rig
the
next
decade
of
elections
in
our
state
is
not
surprising
but
it
is
a
reminder
of
what's
at
stake
nancy
wang
executive
director
of
voters
not
politicians
the
main
group
that
pushed
the
proposal
said
thursday
the
republicans
argue
the
commission
restricts
their
freedom
of
association
because
the
party
can't
choose
the
people
who
will
represent
it
the
amendment
that
voters
approved
instructs
michigan's
secretary
of
state
currently
a
democrat
to
randomly
chose
self-identified
republicans
and
democrats
and
independents
who
apply
for
the
commission
and
to
submit
their
names
to
the
legislative
leaders
of
both
parties
those
politicians
can
eliminate
up
to
people
from
consideration
then
the
secretary
of
state
chooses
commissioners
in
a
random
draw
from
the
pool
of
democrats
republicans
and
independents
the
republicans
in
the
suit
also
argue
that
the
panel
discriminates
based
on
viewpoint
because
republicans
and
democrats
are
treated
differently
they
receive
fewer
seats
than
people
unaffiliated
with
either
party
they
also
say
the
commission
violates
the
first
amendment
because
the
people
who
serve
on
it
are
prohibited
from
discussing
redistricting
outside
of
an
open
meeting
and
from
accepting
gifts
worth
more
than
a
separate
republican
group
filed
a
similar
federal
lawsuit
in
michigan
last
month
in
the
last
time
districts
were
drawn
michigan
republicans
controlled
the
state
legislature
and
drew
districts
that
gave
them
a
significant
political
advantage
behind
the
scenes
the
efforts
were
nakedly
partisan
one

a

about
