political
espionage
campaign
patrick
byrne
threw
his
company's
shares
into
chaos
last
week
after
saying
he
had
a
relationship
with
an
accused
russian
spy
patrick
byrne
the
chief
executive
of
the
e-commerce
website
overstock
com
resigned
thursday
in
bombastic
fashion
after
revealing
he
had
a
relationship
with
a
woman
accused
of
being
a
russian
spy
while
detailing
what
he
called
an
elaborate
espionage
plot
targeting
president
donald
trump
and
former
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton
though
patriotic
americans
are
writing
me
in
support
my
presence
may
affect
and
complicate
all
manner
of
business
relationships
from
insurability
to
strategic
discussions
regarding
our
retail
business
byrne
wrote
to
overstock
shareholders
thus
while
i
believe
that
i
did
what
was
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
country
for
the
good
of
the
firm
i
am
in
the
sad
position
of
having
to
sever
ties
with
overstock
byrne
who
has
for
decades
written
about
conspiracy
theories
on
a
personal
website
declared
himself
far
too
controversial
to
remain
in
his
position
but
said
he
had
set
a
red
line
after
watching
my
country
pull
itself
apart
while
i
knew
many
answers
and
had
to
come
forward
the
departure
came
a
week
after
he
released
an
unprompted
statement
confirming
he
had
been
in
a
relationship
with
maria
butina
an
accused
russian
spy
currently
serving
an
month
prison
term
after
she
allegedly
tried
to
insert
herself
into
powerful
political
circles
at
the
direction
of
the
kremlin
the
news
was
first
reported
by
a
fox
news
contributor
sara
carter
earlier
this
month
after
byrne
described
the
relationship
to
her
he
also
said
he
had
been
working
with
federal
investigators
to
help
them
with
their
clinton
and
russia
investigations
but
said
the
inquiries
turned
out
to
be
less
about
law
enforcement
and
more
about
political
espionage
conducted
against
hillary
clinton
and
donald
trump
shares
of
overstock
fell
sharply
after
his
statement
last
week
but
rebounded
by
about
on
thursday
byrne
said
he
was
prompted
to
come
forward
after
speaking
with
warren
buffett
who
he
referred
to
as
his
omaha
rabbi
he
later
told
the
new
york
times
he
also
came
forward
with
his
statement
before
anyone
else
could
share
his
story
in
the
hours
after
his
resignation
byrne
went
on
a
media
blitz
appearing
on
multiple
networks
to
detail
his
involvement
with
butina
and
his
supposed
work
with
the
fbi
in
an
interview
with
cnn's
chris
cuomo
byrne
suggested
that
senior
figures
at
the
fbi
encouraged
him
to
continue
his
relationship
with
butina
after
he
contacted
them
because
he
had
grown
suspicious
of
her
he
said
the
pair
met
at
a
conference
in
las
vegas
in
the
outspoken
ceo
of
online
home
goods
retailer
overstock
has
resigned
days
after
he
issued
a
press
release
entitled
comments
on
deep
state
that
claimed
he
helped
the
fbi
carry
out
political
espionage

byrne
also
appeared
on
fox
business
to
explain
his
exit
from
overstock
saying
he
had
to
eject
because
he
had
been
warned
that
if
i
come
forward
the
apparatus
of
washington
is
going
to
grind
me
into
a
dust
he
later
claimed
that
he
knew
of
political
espionage
targeting
trump
and
clinton
as
well
as
sens
marco

and

this
isn't
a
theory
of

this
isn't

byrne
said
on

i
was
in
the

when
it
happened
i
was

it
