trump's
new
economic
message
reelect
him
or
it
all
goes
down
the
tubes
a
fascism
expert
points
out
this
was
also
a
message
used
by
former
dictator
benito
mussolini
washington
even
as
signs
of
an
economic
slowdown
due
to
his
trade
war
mount
president
donald
trump
has
a
new
message
for
americans
if
you
don't
reelect
me
you
and
the
whole
country
will
go
broke
if
we
don't
win
in
everything
that
we
have
done
seriously
though
everything
that
we
have
done
your
k
s
they
are
going
to
crash
the
whole
thing
it's
going
to
come
down
like
a
stack
of
cards
trump
told
a
north
carolina
rally
audience
last
month
in
new
hampshire
last
week
he
went
even
further
you
have
no
choice
but
to
vote
for
me
because
your
k
s
down
the
tubes
everything
is
going
to
be
down
the
tubes
while
presidents
have
typically
spun
their
economic
stories
in
the
best
possible
light
and
presidential
hopefuls
have
long
promised
big
improvements
if
they
win
trump
appears
to
the
first
president
or
candidate
in
modern
times
to
claim
that
the
nation
will
fall
into
depression
should
he
not
win
really
other
presidents
haven't
said
things
this
president
is
saying
i'm
shocked
laughed
douglas
holtz-eakin
who
served
as
the
late
arizona
sen
john
mccain's
economic
adviser
during
his
presidential
campaign
jared
bernstein
who
advised
barack
obama
in
that
election
and
became
then-vice
president
joe
biden's
top
economic
adviser
afterward
said
that
even
with
an
actual
financial
crisis
looming
neither
candidate
in
claimed
the
other
would
crash
the
economy
they
sound
like
the
ravings
of
a
pretty
pathological
guy
bernstein
said
of
trump's
assertions
the
pace
at
which
the
crazy
is
coming
seems
to
really
be
increasing
neither
the
white
house
nor
the
trump
campaign
responded
to
requests
for
any
economic
data
or
analysis
that
backed
up
trump's
assertions
trump
defenders
downplayed
his
words
claiming
that
all
politicians
exaggerate
that's
trump
being
trump
said
stephen
moore
a
conservative
activist
whom
trump
briefly
considered
appointing
to
the
federal
reserve
board
trump
likes
to
talk
in
superlatives
moore
said
he
agreed
that
some
of
the
democratic
presidential
candidates
would
be
bad
for
stock
market
investors
but
declined
to
defend
trump's
claim
that
they
would
crash
the
markets
and
the
economy
should
they
win
in
november
trump's
new
claims
expand
on
assertions
he
has
been
making
since
he
won
the
presidency
in
that
had
democrat
hillary
clinton
won
the
markets
would
have
tanked
and
that
under
obama
the
economy
had
been
headed
in
the
wrong
direction
even
that
was
incorrect
said
nariman
behravesh
chief
economist
at
ihs
markit
to
say
that
the
economy
was
going
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
that's
just
not
true
the
economy
was
in
pretty
good
shape
behravesh
said
adding
that
one
could
easily
make
the
argument
that
trump
losing
in
would
be
better
for
the
economy
than
him
winning
given
the
erratic
and
impulsive
manner
with
which
he
has
handled
trade
policy
if
he
were
no
longer
in
the
picture
a
lot
of
that
uncertainty
would
go
away
that
would
actually
help
growth
indeed
despite
trump's
claims
in
remarks
and
tweets
almost
daily
that
the
economy
is
in
great
shape
thanks
to
his
policies
indications
of
a
possible
recession
have
been
increasing
as
the
sugar
high
of
the
tax
cuts
wears
off
at
the
same
time
that
trump's
trade
war
is
starting
to
hurt
more
and
more
american
businesses
the
u.s.
manufacturing
sector
has
declined
for
two
straight
quarters
now
leading
to
a
contraction
in
business
investment
in
the
three
months
that
ended
june
as
a
whole
the
u.s.
economy
grew
by
only
that
quarter
a
figure
that
republicans
including
trump
called
anemic
when
it
happened
under
obama
analysts
are
expecting
a
significant
slowdown
in
car
sales
in
the
coming
months
at
least
partially
because
trump's
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
made
parts
more
expensive
canned
food
giant
del
monte
meanwhile
announced
thursday
that
it
would
lay
off
workers
and
close
two
plants
because
of
increasing
food
and
metal
costs
again
attributable
to
trump's
trade
war
even
a
company
that
trump's
tariffs
were
specifically
designed
to
benefit
u.s.
steel
announced
this
month
that
it
is
idling
a
factory
in
michigan
and
laying
off
workers
due
to
declining
prices
on
top
of
all
this
american
farmers
are
suffering
their
worst
years
in
decades
because
of
retaliatory
tariffs
imposed
by
china
on
u.s.
soybeans
pork
and
other
products
farm
income
is
half
of
what
it
was
six
years
ago
with
some
of
the
chinese
market
possibly
lost
forever
as
buyers
there
find
new
suppliers
in
russia
brazil
and
elsewhere
i
don't
know
if
he
has
early
stage
dementia
but
he
does
have
early
stage
fascism
anthony
scaramucci
holtz-eakin
who
said
he
generally
supports
trump's
tax
cuts
and
rollback
of
business
regulations
said
the
rest
of
the
trump
economic
plan
is
a
mess
the
trade
stuff
is
a
disaster
his
immigration
policy
is
a
nightmare
he
said
bernstein
said
the
general
agreement
among
economists
that
trump's
trade
war
is
behind
many
of
the
warning
signs
now
flashing
means
trump
will
have
a
hard
time
evading
blame
should
things
get
worse
if
what's
going
on
now
morphs
into
a
downturn
it
will
have
trump's
fingerprints
all
over
it
he
added
that
he
expects
trump's
language
to
get
even
more
extreme
every
time
i
hear
trump
nowadays
i'm
reminded
that
a
wounded
tiger
is
a
dangerous
tiger
to
long-time
trump
associate
anthony
scaramucci
trump's
assertions
are
not
merely
wrong
or
even
crazy
but
rather
should
be
seen
as
something
much
darker
i
don't
know
if
he
has
early
stage
dementia
but
he
does
have
early
stage
fascism
said
the
financier
who
was
famously
fired
after
days
as
white
house
communications
director
that's
classic
cult-like
demagoguery
the
president's
currency
is
fear
and
he
transacts
on
fear
ruth
ben-ghiat
a
fascism
expert
and
a
history
professor
at
new
york
university
underscored
that
trump's
claims
about
calamity
echo
dictators
from
the
past
century
it
was
definitely
what
mussolini
said
only
he
could
save
them
she
said
referring
to
the
wwii-era
italian
dictator
trump
warning
that
everything
is
going
downhill
is
just
a
continuation
of
the
scare
tactics
he's
used
since
his
campaign
it's
also
a
sad
attempt
to
make
himself
seem
indispensable
to
voters
without
me
there
will
be
chaos
