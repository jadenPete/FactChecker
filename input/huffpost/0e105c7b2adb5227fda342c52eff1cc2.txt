walsh
the
ex-gop
house
lawmaker
who
railed
against
muslims
and
trafficked
in
racism
suggests
he
could
make
a
moral
case
against
president
donald
trump
update
former
rep
joe
walsh
announced
aug
that
he
would
challenge
president
donald
trump
in
the
republican
primary
previously
former
gop
rep
joe
walsh
has
been
making
noise
in
recent
days
about
a
possible
primary
challenge
to
president
donald
trump
in
trump
walsh
wrote
in
a
new
york
times
op-ed
earlier
this
month
is
not
a
good
leader
but
a
racial
arsonist
who
encourages
bigotry
and
xenophobia
walsh
should
know
the
one-term
former
house
member
from
chicago
who
now
hosts
a
radio
talk
show
has
a
long
history
of
making
racist
and
incendiary
comments
particularly
about
barack
obama
he
falsely
accused
the
former
president
of
being
a
secret
muslim
who
hates
israel
and
regularly
questioned
his
birthplace
a
conspiracy
theory
also
embraced
by
the
current
occupant
of
the
oval
office
obama
walsh
further
argued
only
won
the
election
because
he
is
a
black
man
who
was
articulate
in
after
a
police
shooting
in
dallas
walsh
promised
war
and
warned
obama
to
watch
out
alleging
that
he
helped
get
cops
killed
after
the
domestic
terror
attack
in
san
bernardino
california
he
urged
people
to
do
whatever
we
can
to
defeat
islam
he
was
also
briefly
kicked
off
the
air
for
using
racial
and
ethnic
slurs
on
his
radio
show
then
there's
walsh's
work
boosting
trump
during
the
election
which
he
has
since
renounced
as
a
mistake
and
his
explosive
twitter
account
on
november
th
i'm
voting
for
trump
on
november
th
if
trump
loses
i'm
grabbing
my
musket
you
in
joe
walsh
walshfreedom
october
one
prominent
never
trump
republican
at
least
isn't
buying
it
no
republican
pushed
birther
nonsense
and
jerk
store
politics
more
than
joe
walsh
no
thanks
joe
you
were
trumpy
before
trump
tweeted
doug
heye
a
former
communications
director
at
the
republican
national
committee
in
his
times
op-ed
walsh
apologized
for
his
own
rhetoric
over
the
years
and
for
helping
to
elect
trump
in
in
mr
trump
i
see
the
worst
and
ugliest
iteration
of
views
i
expressed
for
the
better
part
of
a
decade
to
be
sure
i've
had
my
share
of
controversy
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
questioned
mr
obama's
truthfulness
about
his
religion
at
times
i
expressed
hate
for
my
political
opponents
we
now
see
where
this
can
lead
there's
no
place
in
our
politics
for
personal
attacks
like
that
and
i
regret
making
them
if
walsh
does
throw
his
hat
in
the
ring
he'll
be
the
second
republican
to
mount
a
primary
challenge
against
trump
joining
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
former
south
carolina
gop
rep
mark
sanford
is
also
considering
jumping
into
the
race
walsh
argued
thursday
that
the
president
is
vulnerable
on
issues
important
to
conservatives
like
the
deficit
and
spending
free
trade
and
the
use
of
executive
power
it's
his
poor
record
that
makes
him
most
worthy
of
a
primary
challenge
as
walsh
said
during
an
interview
with
cnn
the
only
way
you
primary
donald
trump
and
beat
him
is
to
expose
him
for
the
con
man
he
is
he
added
arguing
trump
can
be
defeated
by
a
challenger
who
can
make
the
moral
case
against
him
