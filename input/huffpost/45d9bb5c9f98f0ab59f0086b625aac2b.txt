objecting
to
the

visiting
this
week
and
requesting
dhs
allow
meaningful
access
to
these
facilities
again
i
am
writing
to
express
my
deep
concern
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
decided
to
block
committee
staff
from
conducting
visits
to
detention
facilities
just
days
after
previous
staff
inspections
revealed
potentially
serious
ongoing
problems
with
the
treatment
of
children
and
adults
in
dhs
custody
including
blocking
visits
to
sites
where
the
inspector
general
warned
about
an
immediate
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
dhs
agents
and
officers
and
to
those
detained
cummings
wrote
in
the
letter
the
letter
also
said
that
dhs
told
the
committee
that
new
restrictions
would
be
placed
on
staffers
access
to
facilities
run
by
u.s.
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
which
falls

serious

august
cummings
said
the
decision
to
bar
committee
staff
goes
against
mcaleenan's
congressional
testimony
last
month
in
which
he
said
he
welcomes
such
visits
to
detention
centers
dhs
did
not
immediately
respond
to
huffpost's
request
for
comment
last
month
the
inspector
general
of
dhs
released
a
report
warning
of
severe
overcrowding
at
some
migrant
detention
centers
citing
dangerous
and
unsanitary
conditions
like
a
lack
of
shower
access
and
room
to
lie
down
cummings
letter
contained
similar
concerns
saying
migrants
told
committee
staff
during
earlier
trips
to
border
patrol
facilities
that
toddlers
were
being
fed
age-inappropriate
food
young
children
were
being
held
in
cold
rooms
without
proper
clothing
and
even
that
a
border
patrol
agent
told
a
child
to
drink
spilled
soup
off
the
floor
migrants
at
the
facilities
also
told
committee
staff
that
agents
pressured
them
into
signing
documents
in
english
without
proper
translation
or
phone
access
according
to
the
committee
chairman
during
visits
to
ice
facilities
many
of
which
are
run
by
for-profit
contractors
migrants
told
committee
staff
that
they
were
being
given
rotten
food
and
inadequate
medical
care
access
the
letter
stated
cummings
cited
an
instance
at
the
adams
county
correctional
center
in
mississippi
where
an
ice
officer
threatened
to
immediately
end
the
congressional
tour
and
cancel
future
visits
after
a
detained
migrant
shouted
through
a
glass
partition
that
he
wanted
to
speak
with
committee
staff
because
he
was
allegedly
being
abused
and
humiliated
at
the
facility
the
letter
came
after
rep
jim
jordan
r-ohio
the
committee's
ranking
member
said
that
the
panel's
staff
were
being
rude
to
officers
at
the
facilities
u.s.
customs
and
border
protection
also
alleged
that
committee
staff
weren't
cooperating
with
officers
cummings
letter
stated
but
cummings
said
the
claims
were
false
and
that
committee
staff
cooperated
with
dhs
while
defending
the
authority
of
congress
to
conduct
an
independent
investigation
of
these
well-documented
abuses
it
appears
that
the
administration
expects
congress
to
be
satisfied
with
receiving
agency
tours
of
facilities
in
some
cases
without
the
ability
to
photograph
conditions
or
interview
detainees
and
not
to
question
the
policies
or
decisions
that
agency
officials
make
cummings
wrote
in
his
letter
that
is
not
the
way
effective
oversight
works
he
continued
congress
has
an
independent
responsibility
under
the
constitution
to
determine
whether
federal
programs
are
operating
as
they
should
be
not
merely
to
accept
the
administration's
word
for
it
