the
u.s.
government
plans
to
launch
a
program
in
roughly
one
month
that
narrowly
focuses
on
protecting
voter
registration
databases
and
systems
ahead
of
the
presidential
election
these
systems
which
are
widely
used
to
validate
the
eligibility
of
voters
before
they
cast
ballots
were
compromised
in
by
russian
hackers
seeking
to
collect
information
intelligence
officials
are
concerned
that
foreign
hackers
in
not
only
will
target
the
databases
but
attempt
to
manipulate
disrupt
or
destroy
the
data
according
to
current
and
former
u.s.
officials
we
assess
these
systems
as
high
risk
said
a
senior
u.s.
official

for

said

that
is
why
we
are
working
alongside
election
officials
and
their

partners
to
help
protect

a
ransomware
attack
typically
locks
an
infected
computer
system
until
payment
usually
in
the
form
of
cryptocurrency
is
sent
to
the
hacker
the
effort
to
counter
ransomware-style
cyberattacks
aimed
at
the
election
runs
parallel
to
a
larger
intelligence
community
directive
to
determine
the
most
likely
vectors
of
digital
attack
in
the
november
election
according
to
current
and
former
u.s.
officials
it
is
imperative
that
states
and
municipalities
limit
the
availability
of
information
about
electoral
systems
or
administrative
processes
and
secure
their
websites
and
databases
that
could
be
exploited
the
fbi
said
in
a
statement
supporting
the
homeland
security
initiative
cisa's
program
will
reach
out
to
state
election
officials
to
prepare
for
such
a
ransomware
scenario
it
will
provide
educational
material
remote
computer
penetration
testing
and
vulnerability
scans
as
well
as
a
list
of
recommendations
on
how
to
prevent
and
recover
from
ransomware
these
guidelines
however
will
not
offer
advice
on
whether
a
state
should
ultimately
pay
or
refuse
to
pay
ransom
to
a
hacker
if
one
of
its
systems
is
already
infected
our
thought
is
we
don't
want
the
states
to
have
to
be
in
that
situation
said
a
homeland
security
official
we're
focused
on
preventing
it
from
happening
a
pre-election
undetected
attack
could
tamper
with
voter
lists
creating
huge
confusion
and
delays
over
the
last
two
years
cyber
criminals
and
nation
state
hacking
groups
have
used
ransomware
to
extort
victims
and
create
chaos
in
one
incident
in
which
has
since
been
attributed
to
russian
hackers
a
ransomware
virus
was
used
to
mask
a
data
deletion
technique
rendering
victim
computers
totally
unusable
that
attack
dubbed
notpetya
went
on
to
damage
global
corporations
including
fedex
and
maersk
which
had
offices
in
ukraine
where
the
malware
first
spread
the
threat
is
concerning
because
of
its
potential
impact
on
voting
results
experts
say
a
pre-election
undetected
attack
could
tamper
with
voter
lists
creating
huge
confusion
and
delays
disenfranchisement
and
at
large
enough
scale
could
compromise
the
validity
of
the
election
said

sebes
chief
technology
officer
of
the
oset
institute
an
election
technology
policy

tank
we're
sure
the
threat
is
far
from
over
the
databases
are
also
particularly
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
attack
because
local
jurisdictions
and
states
actively
add
remove
and
change
the
data
year-round
said
maurice
turner
a
senior
technologist
with
the
center
for
democracy
and
technology
if
the
malicious
actor
doesn't
provide
the
key
the
data
is
lost
forever
unless
the
victim
has
a
recent
backup
nationwide
the
local
governments
that
store
and
update
voter
registration
data
are
typically
ill-equipped
to
defend
themselves
against
elite
hackers
state
election
officials
told
reuters
they
have
improved
their
cyber
defenses
since
including
in
some
cases
preparing
backups
for
voter
registration
databases
in
case
of
an
attack
but
there
is
no
common
standard
for
how
often
local
governments
should
create
backups
said
a
senior
homeland
security
official
we
have
to
remember
that
this
threat
to
our
democracy
will
not
go
away
and
concern
about
ransomware
attacks
on
voter
registration
databases
is
one
clear
example
said
