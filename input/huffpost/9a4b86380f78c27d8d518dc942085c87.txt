trump
backtracks
on
tax
cuts
says
economy
is
already
great
the
white
house
seems
worried
that
looking
worried
about
the
economy
will
worry
people
president
donald
trump
insisted
wednesday
that
he
doesn't
want
another
tax
cut
a
day
after
the
white
house
signaled
that
the
economy
could
use
a
little
help
i
am
not
looking
at
a
tax
cut
now
the
president
told
reporters
in
a
reversal
we
don't
need
it
because
we
have
a
strong
economy
trump
and
his
administration
signaled
through
news
reports
earlier
this
week
that
they
might
favor
a
payroll
tax
cut
as
a
way
of
strengthening
the
economy
some
economists
think
a
recession
could
be
around
the
corner
the
president's
comments
wednesday
suggest
he
realized
it
might
be
weird
to
go
for
another
round
of
tax
cuts
after
all
he
has
previously
said
the
tax
bill
he
signed
in
december
unleashed
an
economic
miracle
asking
for
another
tax
cut
would
be
a
tacit
admission
that
the
first
tax
cut
might
have
been
less
than
miraculous
and
that
the
economy
isn't
so
strong
even
worse
a
payroll
tax
cut
is
something
that
had
been
done
by
barack
obama
the
president
whose
legitimacy
trump
has
denied
for
years
president
obama
did
that
in
order
to
artificially
jack
up
the
economy
trump
said
wednesday
before
complaining
that
the
economy
under
obama
got
more
favorable
interest
rates
from
the
federal
reserve
president
obama
did
two
payroll
tax
cuts
trump
said
despite
that
i
have
a
much
stronger
economy
in
and
congress
cut
payroll
taxes
by
percentage
points
to
increase
consumer
spending
at
a
time
of
high
unemployment
one
of
several
fiscal
policies
enacted
in
the
wake
of
the
great
recession
partly
as
a
result
of
those
efforts
trump
inherited
a
better
economy
with
much
lower
unemployment
the
republican
tax
cuts
and
jobs
act
which
trump
signed
cut
taxes
for
the
vast
majority
of
households
but
especially
for
corporations
the
congressional
budget
office
reported
in
may
that
in
its
first
year
the
new
law
had
done
hardly
anything
for
workers
or
for
economic
growth
in
general
one
major
result
of
the
tax
cuts
however
is
that
the
government
is
bringing
in
much
less
revenue
the
cbo
reported
wednesday
that
the
federal
budget
deficits
will
exceed
trillion
starting
next
year
part
the
deficit
comes
from
increased
spending
part
comes
from
the
trillion-dollar
cost
of
the
tax
cuts
trump
on
wednesday
also
disowned
the
idea
of
cutting
capital
gains
taxes
saying
it
would
overly
benefit
the
rich
the
white
house
has
repeatedly
signaled
that
it
likes
the
idea
trump
said
on
tuesday
that
he
was
considering
both
the
payroll
tax
cut
and
indexing
capital
gains
to
inflation
payroll
tax
is
something
that
we
think
about
and
a
lot
of
people
would
like
to
see
that
and
that
very
much
affects
the
working
the
workers
of
our
country
