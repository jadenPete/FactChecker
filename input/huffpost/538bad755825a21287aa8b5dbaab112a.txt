democrats
are
divided
on
what's
dividing
the
party
the
fault
lines
of
the
primary
are
anything
but
clear-cut
a
new
huffpost
yougov
poll
finds
primary
elections
have
a
way
of
highlighting
a
party's
fault
lines
over
the
past
few
months
democratic
candidates
have
been
publicly
debating
everything
from
single-payer
medicare
for
all
to
the
need
for
generational
change
last
december
in
the
afterglow
of
the
midterms
of
democrats
and
democratic-leaning
voters
said
the
party
was
more
united
than
divided
by
this
july
that
number
had
sunk
nearly
points
and
democrats
are
plenty
divided
about
what
exactly
is
dividing
them
according
to
a
new
huffpost
yougov
poll
some
of
the
most
obvious
divides
are
demographic
former
vice
president
joe
biden
the
race's
early
front-runner
posts
his
best
numbers
among
black
voters
people
over
age
and
people
without
college
degrees
he
has
less
traction
among
white
and
college-educated
voters
and
struggles
especially
with
younger
voters
other
divides
are
ideological
the
party
while
increasingly
liberal
still
encompasses
many
self-described
moderates
democrats
broadly
agree
on
plenty
of
issues
but
there
are
also
concrete
divides
on
everything
from
health
care
to
immigration
alongside
those
cleavages
the
early
stages
of
the
campaign
have
also
been
dogged
by
a
sense
that
the
party
is
facing
some
sort
of
crucial
if
nebulous
philosophical
schism
the
importance
of
electability
maybe
or
the
best
way
of
addressing
president
barack
obama's
legacy
or
the
right
tone
to
take
against
president
donald
trump
or
the
endless
debate
over
whether
campaigns
should
focus
more
on
mobilizing
the
base
or
coaxing
back
swing
voters
many
of
these
binaries
effectively
serve
as
ways
to
pit
biden
an
older
candidate
who's
based
his
appeal
around
his
ties
to
obama
and
his
perceived
ability
to
win
against
the
rest
of
the
field
but
they
also
reflect
larger
questions
about
the
ideological
direction
of
the
party
and
the
approach
democrats
should
take
to
winning
in
and
beyond
to
get
a
better
sense
of
the
democratic
electorate
we
asked
democratic
and
democratic-leaning
voters
about
six
of
these
questions
in
a
new
huffpost
yougov
survey
testing
their
preferences
on
topics
including
ideology
generational
politics
and
strategy
but
posing
these
choices
inherently
risks
making
assumptions
about
how
those
voters
view
the
race
whether
these
are
distinctions
that
particularly
matter
to
them
or
ones
they'd
even
make
if
they
weren't
being
prompted
by
pollsters
so
we
also
asked
voters
how
well
they
thought
each
of
these
choices
defined
the
campaign
each
of
the
contrasts
we
asked
about
was
described
by
a
slim
majority
of
voters
between
and
as
defining
the
primary
at
least
somewhat
well
with
the
frames
about
tone
and
the
obama
presidency
garnering
modestly
less
support
than
the
others
even
fewer
voters
thought
any
one
option
fit
the
race
very
well
ranging
from
the
who
thought
that
the
framing
of
the
race
as
a
generational
choice
was
very
fitting
to
the
who
saw
the
electability
argument
as
being
definitional
ariel
edwards-levy
huffpost
in
a
new
huffpost
yougov
poll
fewer
than
a
third
of
democratic
and
democratic-leaning
voters
described
any
of
these
choices
as
describing
the
primary
election
very
well
those
results
suggest
that
while
voters
do
see
real
philosophical
divides
on
how
the
democratic
party
should
approach
they
don't
necessarily
perceive
the
election
as
a
referendum
on
any
one
key
fracture
or
at
least
not
any
of
the
ones
included
in
this
survey
the
poll
also
asked
democratic
and
democratic-leaning
voters
which
of
the
options
if
either
they
favored
for
each
question
they
preferred
a
new
generation
by
points
a
take
the
high
road
approach
by
points
liberal
ideology
by
points
and
a
strategy
focused
on
mobilizing
the
base
by
points
opinions
were
within
points
of
evenly
split
on
obama's
legacy
and
the
importance
of
electability
on
each
question
a
fifth
or
more
weren't
sure
or
said
they
didn't
really
have
a
preference
two
important
caveats
here
first
responses
can
vary
considerably
based
on
how
exactly
these
choices
are
framed
other
polling
for
example
has
often
found
voters
placing
far
more
of
a
premium
on
electability
and
second
rather
than
picking
their
favorite
candidate
based
on
the
philosophies
they
represent
voters
may
instead
gravitate
toward
the
standpoints
or
traits
that
reflect
the
candidates
they
already
support
ariel
edwards-levy
huffpost
in
this
poll
democratic
and
democratic-leaning
voters
favor
a
new
generation
over
an
older
one
a
finding
that's
not
necessarily
reflected
in
their
current
choice
of
candidates
in
horserace
polls
broadly
the
results
raise
doubts
about
whether
voters
are
treating
any
of
the
questions
as
clear
road
maps
for
deciding
which
candidates
to
back
two
attributes
for
which
voters
show
the
strongest
preferences
a
new
generation
and
a
higher
road
don't
quite
line
up
with
the
horserace
polling
so
far
older
candidates
may
not
be
winning
voters
on
the
basis
of
their
age
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
notably
hurt
them
either
biden
sen
bernie
sanders
i-vt
and
sen
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
the
three
oldest
candidates
in
the
race
are
the
three
current
front-runners
and
voters
seemingly
have
yet
to
punish
any
candidate
for
taking
too
aggressive
a
tone
against
trump
in
other
words
there's
probably
no
set
of
clear
primary
lanes
ideological
or
otherwise
for
voters
to
follow
as
they
narrow
down
their
list
of
candidates
instead
there's
a
cavalcade
of
often
competing
priorities
that's
borne
out
by
data
on
whom
voters
are
actually
considering
which
often
fails
to
follow
any
easily
discernible
patterns
a
reliable
rule
of
thumb
about
nomination
politics
is
that
when
voters
are
required
to
make
an
electoral
choice
among
multiple
candidates
within
the
same
party
their
preferences
will
be
relatively
weak
unpredictable
based
on
limited
information
and
open
to
change
up
until
the
moment
they
cast
their
ballot

process
