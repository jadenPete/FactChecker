republicans
underestimate
my

bc
i
invite
people

talk
about
policy
in
plain
english
instead
of
dc

that's
dumb

the
mrc
tv
video
is
framed
as
a
spoof
of
jack
handey's
deep
thoughts
skit
from
saturday
night
live
dubbed
shallow
thoughts
it
features
footage
of
ocasio-cortez
discussing
climate
change
that
had
originally
appeared
on
her
instagram
in
the
story
ocasio-cortez
said
that
fighting
climate
change
may
be
expensive
but
ignoring
it
could
have
much
more
costly
effects
you
think
overhauling
our
economy
to
decarbonize
and
save
the
planet
is
going
to
be
expensive
try
not
decarbonizing
our
economy
and
allowing
sea
levels
to
rise
every
coastal
city
to
go
underwater
she
said
mrc
responded
to
ocasio-cortez's
response
with
a
blog
post
that
mocked
her
intelligence
for
mistaking
the
conservative
organization
as
an
official
republican
group
they
said
the
video
was
not
an
ad
and
was
not
paid
for
by
the
gop
numerous
twitter
users
responded
to
mrc's
