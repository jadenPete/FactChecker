the

sen
susan
collins
r-maine
refused
to
budge
on
her
controversial
support
for
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh's
confirmation
last
year
and
now
the
consequences
of
that
decision
may
be
coming
home
to
roost
in
an
interview
with
politico
published
monday
the
senator
acknowledged
that
her
reelection
bid
will
inevitably
be
affected
by
her
decision
to
vote
for
kavanaugh
after
christine
blasey
ford
accused
him
of
sexually
assaulting
her
when
they
were
in
high
school
but
collins
stood
behind
that
choice
have
i
lost
some
votes
because
of
my
decision
to
support
justice
kavanaugh
yes
i
have
and
i'm
sad
about
that
because
i
explained
in
great
depth
my
decision-making
she
said
before
adding
that
there
is
still
an
appreciation
in
maine
for
someone
who
looks
at
the
facts
of
an
issue
votes
with
integrity
and
independence
collins
known
as
a
moderate
was
once
untouchable
in
maine
politics
handily
winning
her
reelection
with
just
over
of
the
vote
but
as
looms
it
is
increasingly
clear
that
it
will
not
be
smooth
sailing
for
collins
this
time
she
faces
a
republican
challenger
in
the
primary
and
last
week
the
cook
political
report
adjusted
its
senate
election
forecast
for
the
state
from
lean
republican
to
toss
up
indicating
there's
diminished
confidence
in
collins
potential
to
win
meanwhile
maine's
democratic
state
house
speaker
sara
gideon
who
announced
in
june
that
she
was
running
in
the
democratic
primary
for
senator
has
attempted
to
use
some
of
collins
decisions
such
as
her
endorsement
of
kavanaugh
to
portray
her
as
a
partisan
figure
at
one
point
maybe
she
was
different
than
some
of
the
other
folks
in
washington
but
she
doesn't
seem
that
way
anymore
gideon
said
in
a
campaign
announcement
video
adding
that
collins
vote
to
put
brett
kavanaugh
on
the
supreme
court
may
be
paying
off
for
her
but
it's
put
women's
control
over
their
own
health
care
decisions
in
extreme
jeopardy
