in

was
one
of
four
sons
born
to
mary
koch
and
oil
industry
tycoon
fred
koch
in
wichita
kansas
the
four
brothers
frederick
charles
and
twins
david
and
bill
inherited
control
of
wood
river
oil
and
refining
company
their
father's
oil
business
after
his
death
in
and
promptly
renamed
it
koch
industries
charles
initially
took
charge
of
the
firm
but
david
joined
him
in
the
two
brothers
built
the
company
into
one
of
the
most
profitable
and
successful
corporations
in
the
united
states
they
became
two
of
the
richest
americans
in
the
process
david
koch
died
with
a
net
worth
of
billion
david
koch
did
not
just
inherit
the
family
business
but
the
family
politics
as
well
his
father
was
one
of
the
founding
members
of
the
far-right
john
birch
society
in
fred
koch's
conservative
politics
came
partly
from
his
time
building
oil
refineries
for
joseph
stalin's
communist
government
in
the
u.s.s.r.
in
the
s
the
elder
koch
also
built
oil
refining
infrastructure
for
adolf
hitler's
nazi
regime
in
germany
during
this
period
david
would
later
say
that
his
father
was
a
very
conservative
republican
and
was
not
a
fan
of
big
government
fred
koch
was
constantly
speaking
to
us
children
about
what
was
wrong
with
government
and
government
policy
david
koch
told
journalist
brian
doherty
for
his
history
of
the
u.s.
libertarian
movement
it's
something
i
grew
up
with
a
fundamental
point
of
view
that
big
government
was
bad
and
impositions
of
government
controls
on
our
lives
and
economic
fortunes
was
not
good
both
and
david
and
charles
koch
took
these
beliefs
to
heart
and
as
they
built
their
father's
business
into
an
empire
invested
their
increasing
wealth
heavily
into
a
political
movement
opposed
to
government
spending
and
programs
in
the
s
the
brothers
helped
to
found
the
libertarian
cato
institute
a
powerful
think
tank
to
spread
free
market
capitalist
ideology
and
promote
libertarian
ideas
about
free
speech
government
surveillance
invasion
of
privacy
immigration
and
war
as
the
more
extroverted
of
the
two
siblings
david
koch
took
on
a
public
role
in
as
the
running
mate
to
libertarian
party
presidential
candidate
ed
clark
koch
funded
the
campaign
with
of
his
own
money
the
clark-koch
ticket
won
just
percent
of
the
vote
on
a
platform
of
ending
social
security
welfare
minimum
wage
and
labor
laws
corporate
taxes
and
a
host
of
government
agencies
including
the
fbi
cia
department
of
energy
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
occupational
health
and
safety
administration
among
others
in
david
koch
founded
citizens
for
a
sound
economy
a
political
organization
that
would
promote
free-market
capitalism
and
conservative
politicians
in
the
republican
party
citizens
for
a
sound
economy
put
the
kochs
in
closer
contact
with
republican
politicians
than
before
but
they
still
remained
in
the
background
a
final
congressional
report
into
campaign
finance
improprieties
during
the
election
suggested
that
much
of
the
secret
spending
to
support
republican
candidates
came
from
koch-linked
groups
like
citizens
for
a
sound
economy
but
could
not
conclusively
prove
this
as
david
and
charles
koch
built
their
political
empire
they
fought
their
other
brothers
for
control
of
the
family
business
frederick
koch
the
eldest
brother
and
bill
koch
david's
twin
sued
their
siblings
in
ultimately
settling
for
billion
this
lawsuit
left
david
and
charles
koch
the
sole
family
owners
of
the
business
over
the
next
two
decades
their
oil
chemical
and
agricultural
products
company
would
rack
up
nearly
million
in
fines
from
the
government
for
violating
environmental
and
workplace
safety
laws
while
charles
koch
remained
in
wichita
kansas
to
head
koch
industries
david

lived
in

the
wealthiest

of
millions
of

to
new

hospitals
and
cancer
research
centers
many
of
which
now
bear
his
name
while
his
cancer
went
into
remission
it
returned
more
than
once
over
the
course
of
his
life
in
he
married
julia
flesher
of
little
rock
arkansas
then
a
year-old
assistant
to
the
dress
designer
adolpho
and
a
socialite
on
the
upper
east
side
he
is
survived
by
his
wife
and
his
three
children
mary
david
jr
and
john
koch's
rise
to
national
political
prominence
did
not
really
begin
until
the
late
s
in
an
internal
tug-of-war
within
citizens
for
a
sound
economy
split
the
group
into
two
koch
took
his
half
of
the
organization
and
started
the
conservative
nonprofit
americans
for
prosperity
after
barack
obama
won
the
presidency
in
americans
for
prosperity
and
the
koch
brothers
emerged
as
the
main
funders
of
the
opposition
they
helped
finance
the
tea
party
protests
that
engulfed
obama's
first
term
david
koch
echoed
his
father's
conspiratorial
birch
society
conservatism
when
he
said
that
obama
was
a
hardcore
socialist
who
was
pretending
to
be
something
other
than
that
the
koch
political
operation
was
supercharged
by
the
supreme
court's
citizens
united
decision
which
dramatically
loosened
campaign
finance
laws
for
independent
political
organizations
like
americans
for
prosperity
the
koch
brothers
organized
hundreds
of
like-minded
billionaires
and
millionaires
to
donate
to
conservative
political
groups
to
help
elect
republican
candidates
the
koch
brothers
contributions
to
colleges
and
universities
across
the
united
states
also
perpetuated
their
political
mission
they
gave
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
schools
for
classes
that
promoted
free-market
capitalism
or
hired
researchers
and
professors
the
kochs
approved
of
for
their
politics
or
research
while
david
koch
claimed
to
oppose
military
interventions
like
the
iraq
war
and
support
gay
rights
and
women's
access
to
abortion
his
money
and
political
organizing
largely
benefited
politicians
who
felt
otherwise
free-market
capitalism
was
his
main
political
goal
by
the
end
of
his
life
he
had
helped
push
the
republican
party
closer
to
his
goals
through
the
sheer
power
of
his
wealth

advocacy
