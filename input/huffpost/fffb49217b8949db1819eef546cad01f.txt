over
people
have
been
arrested
as
potential
mass
shooters
since
el
paso
tips
about
potential
acts
of
mass
killings
have
spiked
and
law
enforcement
appears
to
be
paying
close
attention
to
threats
in
the
four
weeks
since
a
year-old
alleged
white
nationalist
was
charged
in
the
slaughter
of
people
inside
a
walmart
in
el
paso
texas
law
enforcement
authorities
have
arrested
more
than
people
as
potential
mass
shooters
an
average
of
more
than
one
per
day
a
huffpost
survey
of
these
arrests
likely
didn't
capture
every
one
but
it
offers
a
snapshot
of
the
types
of
cases
that
law
enforcement
officials
face
in
a
country
with
easy
access
to
weapons
capable
of
killing
a
lot
of
people
quickly
the
cases
range
from
allegations
of
vague
social
media
threats
from
juveniles
that
set
parents
on
edge
to
well-developed
plots
from
people
who
had
access
to
weapons
and
appeared
to
authorities
to
have
been
planning
a
mass
murder
there
were
roughly
a
dozen
cases
involving
right-wing
ideology
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
alleged
threats
against
schools
there
were
half
a
dozen
cases
involving
alleged
threats
against
walmarts
in
the
wake
of
el
paso
law
enforcement
is
clearly
paying
very
close
attention
to
threats
of
mass
violence
our
review
of
court
filings
reveals
that
federal
law
enforcement
officials
after
el
paso
took
investigative
steps
against
a
few
defendants
who
had
been
already
been
on
their
radar
and
some
of
those
arrested
were
inspired
by
the
el
paso
attack
according
to
authorities
the
public
is
paying
closer
attention
as
well
as
evidenced
by
the
spike
in
tips
to
the
fbi
after
that
aug
massacre
in
the
first
week
in
august
the
fbi
saw
an
increase
in
tips
submitted
to
the
national
threat
operations
center
the
bureau
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
the
fbi
component
that
operates
call-fbi
and
sorts
through
information
submitted
to
tips
fbi
gov
such
increases
are
often
observed
after
major
incidents
as
always
the
fbi
encourages
the
public
to
remain
vigilant
and
report
any
and
all
suspicious
activity
to
law
enforcement
immediately
in
a
statement
after
the
el
paso
attack
the
fbi
said
it
remains
concerned
that
u.s.
based
domestic
violent
extremists
could
become
inspired
by
these
and
previous
high-profile
attacks
to
engage
in
similar
acts
of
violence
that
concern
was
emphasized
in
a
call
with
the
fbi
leaders
and
state
and
local
partners
just
after
the
mass
shootings
in
el
paso
and
a
day
later
in
dayton
ohio
according
to
the
bureau
a
number
of
the
alleged
threats
if
carried
out
would
have
qualified
as
instances
of
domestic
terrorism
a
top
fbi
official
told
reporters
this
year
that
domestic
terrorism
cases
were
challenging
for
the
bureau
the
disparate
handling
of
right-wing
and
islamic
terrorism
has
set
off
a
debate
over
the
need
for
a
domestic
terrorism
law
and
one
prominent
lawmaker
has
introduced
such
legislation
which
has
already
raised
objections
from
civil
liberties
advocates
as
of
late
july
fbi
director
christopher
wray
told
a
senate
committee
that
the
fbi
had
already
been
involved
in
domestic
terrorism-related
arrests
in
the
first
three-quarters
of
the
fiscal
year
which
began
in
october
the
rapid
pace
of
new
cases
suggests
that
the
number
of
domestic
terrorism-related
cases
in
the
fiscal
year
could
outpace
the
and
fiscal
year
figures
bureau
officials
said
they'll
use
any
tool
they
can
to
take
out
a
potential
threat
and
a
review
of
the
cases
suggests
the
fbi
was
involved
in
a
number
of
cases
that
resulted
in
local
charges
it
may
not
be
evident
in
the
face
of
the
crime
or
who's
involved
working
it
that
it's
a
domestic
terrorism
suspect
who
was
arrested
an
fbi
official
previously
said
we
use
anything
in
federal
law
we
can
that
fits
that's
appropriate
the
case
of
thomas
bolin
illustrates
the
challenge
these
cases
pose
for
the
fbi
bolin
a
year-old
from
new
york
moderated
a
white
supremacist
forum
he
was
arrested
by
the
fbi
after
allegedly
discussing
an
attack
with
his
cousin
he
posted
a
photo
of
himself
wearing
a
mask
and
holding
a
gun
then
lied
to
the
fbi
about
his
weapon
bolin
was
given
a
sentence
for
lying
to
the
fbi
of
time
served
after
spending
about
three
months
behind
bars
and
was
released
early
last
month
the
challenge
in
finding
an
applicable
federal
charge
in
part
could
help
explain
why
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
arrests
surveyed
by
huffpost
in
the
past
four
weeks
resulted
in
federal
charges
the
first
week
after
el
paso
back
in
february
fbi
