the
lawsuit
resurfaced
after
trump
told
reporters
covering
this
year's
g-
meeting
in
biarritz
france
that
the
doral
property
would
be
the
perfect
location
for
the
summit
citing
its
proximity
to
the
miami
airport
in
a
great
area
we
haven't
had
anything
that
could
even
come
close
to
competing
with
it
especially
when
you
look
at
the
location
he
pitched
so
many
places
are
so
far
away
the
drive
is
so
long
they
need
helicopters
this
is
somewhere
you
can
be
at
within
minutes
of
landing
ethics
experts
say
the
president's
push
to
profit
from
the
summit
amounts
to
open
corruption
