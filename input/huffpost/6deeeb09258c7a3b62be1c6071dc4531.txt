joe
walsh
says
he's
not
racist
but
has
said
racist
things
on
twitter
the
gop
presidential
hopeful
and
former
congressman
has
a
long
history
of
racism
including
claiming
obama
was
muslim
and
using
a
racist
slur
in
tweets
former
rep
joe
walsh
r-ill
who
is
challenging
president
donald
trump
in
doesn't
appear
to
know
what
being
racist
means
in
an
interview
with
msnbc
on
monday
host
john
heilemann
called
the
former
tea
party
congressman
racist
reminding
walsh
he
had
used
the
n-word
in
tweets
and
had
falsely
called
former
president
barack
obama
a
muslim
he
asked
how
walsh
could
have
any
moral
standing
to
challenge
trump
whom
heilemann
had
earlier
called
a
stone-cold
racist
i
wouldn't
call
myself
a
racist
but
i
would
say
john
i've
said
racist
things
on
twitter
walsh
responded
there's
no
doubt
about
it
and
apology
is
not
enough
walsh
then
defended
some
of
his
racist
statements
saying
that
though
falsely
stating
that
obama
was
muslim
was
a
horrible
thing
to
say
he
did
so
because
i
was
so
disgusted
with
obama's
policy
toward
israel
that
i
went
a
bad
ugly
step
he
then
tried
to
justify
using
the
n-word
in
a
tweet
saying
he
did
it
to
make
a
point
about
the
washington
redskins
football
team
name
because
they
wanted
to
change
the
name
of
the
washington
redskins
so
they
said
redskins
is
the
new
n-word
that's
bs
the
n-word
has
a
unique
ugly
history
in
this
country
walsh
said
to
make
that
point
i
wrote
down
the
n-word
in
a
tweet
to
make
a
point
that
that's
not
nearly
what
the
word
redskins
is
walsh
has
a
long
history
of
racist
islamophobic
and
controversial
comments
huffpost
reached
out
to
walsh's
campaign
to
clarify
what
he
thinks
it
means
for
someone
to
be
racist
if
it's
not
making
racist
statements
but
did
not
immediately
receive
a
response
i
think
that
we
all
if
we're
honest
white
black
and
brown
we've
all
got
a
little
bit
of
racism
in
us
walsh
told
a
washington
post
reporter
of
his
comments
on
msnbc
there's
no
doubt
that
there
are
times
where
i've
pushed
the
envelope
and
said
things
that
could
certainly
be
interpreted
as
racist
later
on
monday
walsh
a
conservative
radio
show
host
told
cnn
he
had
lost
his
national
radio
show
but
did
not
yet
know
why
he
speculated
it
could
be
related
to
his
running
against
trump
who
is
popular
with
his
listeners
icymi
jheil
pushes
walshfreedom
on
his
past
comments
you
get
that
calling
the
president
muslim
saying
he
was
born
in
kenya
etc
etc
makes
people
doubt
your
moral
standing
to
take
on
someone
who
one
of
his
primary
moral
failings
is
his
racism

walsh
is
the
second
republican
to
announce
a
long-shot
bid
to
challenge
trump
following
former
massachusetts
gov
bill
weld
while
walsh
once
threatened
to
take
up
arms
if
trump
were
not
elected
in
recent
months
he's
appeared
to
try
to
distance
himself
from
trump's
rhetoric
calling
out
the
president's
racism
on
twitter
and
writing
in
a
new
york
times
op-ed
this
month
trump
is
a
racial
arsonist
who
encourages
bigotry
and
xenophobia
to
rouse
his
base
however
walsh's
ongoing
history
of
racist
comments
belies
those
attempts
at
distancing
on
monday
he
doubled
down
on
his
comments
calling
haiti
a
shithole
telling
the
same
washington
post
reporter
there's
an
example
of
where
i'm
trying
to
be
provocative
i
hardly
agree
with
anything
trump
said
look
haiti
is
a
shithole
you
could
describe
it
as
other
things
too
just
last
year
walsh
again
called
obama
a
muslim
and
said
he
was
elected
because
he's
black
in
his
monday
appearance
on
msnbc
he
said
i
never
did
get
into
birther
stuff
but
several
of
walsh's
tweets
from
and
at
least
show
him
promoting
the
racist
birther
theory
that
obama
was
born
in
kenya
walsh
also
waffled
monday
on
whether
to
call
trump
a
racist
first
saying
i
don't
think
trump's
a
racist
all
trump
cares
about
is
himself
i
mean
he'll
throw
out
racist
stuff
then
one
of
the
hosts
challenged
him
you
don't
know
that
trump's
a
racist
well
then
he's
a
racist
he's
a
bigot
he's
a
xenophobe
walsh
responded
because
he'll
use
everything
to
just
simply
advance
his
interests
