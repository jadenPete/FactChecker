trump
allies
hoped
freeing
a
ap
rocky
would
help
him
win
over
black
voters
allies
of
the
president
who
helped
arrange
the
rapper's
release
from
a
swedish
jail
are
reportedly
miffed
he
hasn't
publicly
expressed
his
gratitude
to
trump
washington
when
rapper
a
ap
rocky
was
freed
from
detention
in
sweden
and
returned
to
the
united
states
earlier
this
month
it
marked
the
end
of
a
bizarre
saga
that
at
one
point
involved
the
president
his
son-in-law
jared
kushner
and
the
state
department's
top
hostage
negotiator
though
president
trump's
campaign
to
free
rocky
appeared
to
end
well
a
behind-the-scenes
battle
provides
a
unique
glimpse
into
the
unusual
characters
and
fraught
tensions
involved
in
trump's
outreach
efforts
to
the
black
community
according
to
new
details
provided
by
sources
involved
trump's
role
in
pushing
for
rocky's
release
started
with
a
reality
television
megastar
calling
the
west
wing
a
mysterious
entertainment
industry
fixer
and
two
trump
supporters
the
president's
allies
who
connected
rocky's
team
with
the
white
house
hoped
to
facilitate
a
scene
that
would
bolster
trump's
image
among
african-americans
instead
they
say
they
were
left
angry
when
rocky
failed
to
thank
trump
or
those
around
him
rocky's
legal
woes
began
on
june
when
he
was
involved
in
a
street
brawl
in
stockholm
on
july
a
swedish
court
ruled
that
rocky
and
two
of
his
associates
were
flight
risks
and
needed
to
be
detained
as
the
investigation
into
the
incident
continued
rocky
claimed
he
had
acted
in
self-defense
and
released
videos
on
instagram
showing
that
the
man
he
hit
had
followed
him
through
the
streets
the
rapper
whose
real
name
is
rakim
mayers
ultimately
spent
nearly
a
month
in
detention
behind
the
scenes
the
white
house
and
its
unconventional
allies
scrambled
to
secure
rocky's
freedom
darrell
scott
and
kareem
lanier
entered
the
picture
a
few
days
after
rocky
was
detained
scott
an
ohio
pastor
was
one
of
trump's
highest-profile
african-american
surrogates
during
the
campaign
and
went
on
to
serve
on
his
transition
team
lanier
is
the
co-chairman
of
the
urban
revitalization
coalition
a
nonprofit
led
by
scott
dedicated
to
promoting
elements
of
the
trump
agenda
to
the
black
community
the
two
men
who
were
hardly
household
names
have
become
a
regular
presence
at
the
white
house
at
events
focused
on
addressing
african-american
issues
scott
and
lanier
said
they
became
involved
after
hearing
from
a
man
named
hassan
muhammad
who
describes
himself
as
a
fixer
for
high-profile
figures
in
the
entertainment
industry
in
a
pair
of
phone
conversations
this
week
muhammad
who
has
no
web
presence
and
was
unwilling
to
name
any
of
his
contacts
said
an
associate
of
rocky's
reached
out
to
him
about
the
rapper's
situation
i
know
how
to
handle
or
solve
problems
muhammad
said
muhammad
who
had
met
scott
and
lanier
in
reached
out
to
the
two
trump
associates
for
help
on
july
just
five
days
after
the
swedish
court
ruled
that
rocky
should
be
detained
if
you
are
in
a
situation
like
this
then
there's
only
one
or
two
places
you
call
the
white
house
or
the
state
department
muhammad
said
to
rocky's
team
adding
i
know
somebody
at
the
white
house
while
scott
said
he
was
initially
skeptical
of
rocky
he
decided
to
get
involved
after
watching
full
videos
of
the
incident
that
left
him
feeling
the
rapper
had
been
harassed
by
the
man
he
was
accused
of
assaulting
and
then
railroaded
by
the
swedish
justice
system
lanier
said
he
viewed
rocky's
detention
as
a
black
man
that
we
believe
is
innocent
stuck
in
jail
the
two
men
also
saw
a
case
that
would
appeal
to
trump
who
has
backed
bipartisan
criminal
justice
reform
and
issued
pardons
and
interventions
in
individual
cases
scott
and
lanier
thought
rocky's
case
could
be
a
similar
opportunity
the
president
is
so
pro-criminal
justice
reform
sentencing
reform
we
knew
this
would
be
something
that
would
be
right
up
his
wheelhouse
lanier
said
after
muhammad
told
lanier
and
scott
about
the
case
he
put
lanier
on
the
phone
with
rocky's
manager
john
ehmann
lanier
said
ehmann
was
adamant
that
rocky
needed
presidential
intervention
he
said
if
the
white
house
does
not
get
involved
rocky
is
screwed
lanier
recounted
scott
and
lanier
claimed
they
made
clear
to
ehmann
that
they
had
one
requirement
the
white
house
didn't
ask
for
anything
there
were
no
conditions
attached
but
my
condition
and
kareem's
condition
was
that
all
i'm
asking
for
you
guys
to
do
is
say
thank
you
scott
recalled
telling
rocky's
manager
according
to
scott
ehmann
responded
if
a
serial
killer
gets
rocky
out
of
jail
i
would
have
no
problem
saying
thank
you
to
the
serial
killer
ehmann
did
not
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
comment
including
specific
questions
about
whether
he
made
comments
that
were
attributed
to
him
by
scott
and
lanier
four
other
representatives
for
the
rapper
also
did
not
respond
to
repeated
requests
for
comment
with
that
out
of
the
way
scott
and
lanier
reached
out
to
kushner
the
president's
adviser
and
son-in-law
kushner
became
their
main
point
of
contact
in
the
west
wing
a
source
close
to
kushner
said
there
were
two
streams
of
people
who
were
in
touch
with
him
about
rocky's
case
scott
and
lanier
were
one
and
reality
television
star
kim
kardashian
was
the
other
kardashian
an
advocate
of
criminal
justice
reform
has
also
visited
the
white
house
to
push
for
the
release
of
individual
prisoners
the
source
said
kardashian
was
urged
to
advocate
for
rocky
by
her
husband
kanye
west
the
rapper
who
controversially
declared
support
for
trump
and
had
an
oval
office
visit
of
his
own
in
late
according
to
the
source
after
kushner
heard
about
rocky
he
brought
it
to
the
president
who
tasked
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
with
taking
the
lead
on
the
issue
however
both
kushner
and
trump
stayed
involved
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
scott
and
lanier
provided
yahoo
with
copies
of
emails
texts
and
chat
messages
that
they
said
came
from
ehmann
and
other
members
of
the
rapper's
team
in
messages
that
were
dated
july
ehmann
passed
along
an
email
address
for
swedish
prosecutor
fredrik
karlsson
and
provided
a
document
listing
talking
points
that
could
be
used
in
emails
advocating
for
rocky's
release
scott
then
emailed
the
prosecutor
highlighting
his
own
ties
to
trump
i'm
reaching
out
to
you
with
all
due
respect
for
your
great
country
and
for
the
office
you
hold
on
behalf
of
the
artist
known
as
a
ap
rocky
i
by
no
means
intend
any
offense
nor
disregard
for
your
country's
legal
system
nor
for
your
acumen
as
a
prosecutor
scott
wrote
scott
described
rocky's
potential
release
as
a
tremendous
demonstration
of
goodwill
not
only
between
our
two
countries
but
also
between
your
country
and
the
african
american
community
in
the
united
states
he
said
karlsson
did
not
respond
to
the
email
on
july
trump
traveled
to
cleveland
where
lanier
and
scott
said
they
saw
the
president
and
discussed
rocky's
case
scott
also
said
he
and
trump
talked
about
the
situation
in
a
subsequent
phone
conversation
in
which
the
president
asked
what
do
you
think
about
this
rocky
guy
he's
a
good
guy
it's
a
good
move
scott
responded
seven
days
after
the
cleveland
trip
trump
weighed
in
from
the
oval
office
as
he
fielded
questions
from
reporters
many
many
members
of
the
african-american
community
have
called
me
friends
of
mine
and
said
could
you
help
trump
said
so
i
personally
don't
know
a
ap
rocky
but
i
can
tell
you
he
has
a
lot
of
support
from
the
african-american
community
in
this
country
later
that
day
trump
announced
on
twitter
that
he
had
spoken
to
kanye
west
about
the
case
and
planned
to
call
the
swedish
prime
minister
the
source
close
to
kushner
said
it
was
the
president's
son-in-law
who
set
up
the
call
with
west
but
by
this
point
it
seems
tension
had
built
up
between
the
rapper's
associates
and
the
trump
allies
scott
and
lanier
believed
damien
granderson
an
attorney
working
for
rocky
was
too
nonchalant
about
the
news
that
trump
was
lobbying
on
the
rapper's
behalf
lanier
said
he
snapped
at
granderson
and
cursed
him
out
i
was
like
man
you
ungrateful
motherf
ers
you
i
can't
believe
you
we
didn't
ask
you
guys
for
nothing
other
than
for
you
guys
to
be
grateful
lanier
said
he
told
him
we
just
want
you
guys
to
be
appreciative
and
say
thank
you
granderson
did
not
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
comment
despite
the
angry
exchanges
lanier
said
he
and
scott
continued
to
work
with
rocky's
team
because
they
believed
the
rapper
was
innocent
and
had
been
treated
unfairly
after
speaking
with
the
prime
minister
trump
took
to
twitter
and
said
he
had
assured
his
counterpart
that
rocky
wasn't
a
flight
risk
and
offered
to
personally
vouch
for
his
bail
or
an
alternative
lanier
said
kushner
reported
back
and
said
trump
suggested
that
rocky
could
be
held
in
the
u.s.
embassy
or
a
hotel
until
his
trial
was
completed
the
messages
provided
by
lanier
and
scott
indicate
they
stayed
in
touch
with
rocky's
team
after
this
call
in
a
july
message
ehmann
passed
the
two
men
a
note
from
rocky's
swedish
lawyer
slobodan
jovicic
that
said
trump's
personal
assurance
that
the
rapper
would
not
be
a
flight
risk
could
be
a
game
changer
as
they
sought
his
release
from
jail
no
american
president
has
made
this
kind
of
a
guarantee
before
jovicic
said
in
the
email
as
i
see
it
this
is
new
evidence
and
they
can
never
use
this
move
against
us
i
e
it
can't
be
wrong
to
think
that
a
guarantee
from
america's
president
can
make
a
difference
jovicic
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
and
questions
about
his
statements
in
the
email
rocky
stayed
in
detention
for
nearly
two
more
weeks
while
trump
continued
to
send
angry
tweets
directed
at
the
swedish
prime
minister
and
dispatched
the
state
department's
top
hostage
negotiator
to
stockholm
to
work
on
the
case
the
president's
actions
on
rocky's
behalf
prompted
some
critics
to
accuse
him
of
pandering
to
the
black
community
with
his
highly
public
efforts
lanier
dismissed
that
argument
he
won
the
election
with
percent
of
the
black
vote
he
said
of
trump
he
doesn't
need
black
voters
or
need
a
ap
rocky
to
get
black
voters
he
did
this
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
on
aug
when
the
trial
concluded
rocky
was
released
and
allowed
to
return
to
the
united
states
even
though
a
verdict
had
not
been
reached
in
the
case
lanier
and
scott
said
they
began
reaching
out
to
rocky's
team
within
hours
of
the
rapper's
release
they
were
expecting
a
thank-you
we
don't
get
a
call
we
don't
get
a
call
at
all
scott
said
when
they
got
ehmann
on
the
phone
scott
said
the
rapper's
manager
started
making
all
these
excuses
about
rocky
needing
time
to
travel
and
rest
scott
said
he
told
ehmann
i
hope
you
guys
aren't
going
back
on
what
you
said
you
were
going
to
do
on
the
day
of
his
release
rocky
put
a
post
on
instagram
thanking
fans
and
friends
who
supported
him
scott
dismissed
this
as
generic
and
kept
pressing
ehmann
about
when
rocky
would
do
something
specifically
thanking
the
white
house
scott
said
it
was
embarrassing
to
have
to
tell
kushner
who
reached
out
to
him
after
rocky's
release
that
they
had
no
communication
from
the
rapper
according
to
lanier
ehmann
promised
to
put
a
kushner-rocky
call
together
within
hours
but
then
lanier
said
ehmann
stopped
returning
our
text
messages
the
two
men
kept
pressing
rocky's
team
on
aug
a
panel
of
judges
announced
that
they
found
rocky
guilty
of
assault
but
would
not
require
him
to
serve
any
prison
time
rocky
responded
with
another
broad
message
of
gratitude
that
didn't
name
the
white
house
both
lanier
and
scott
were
upset
that
rocky
never
acknowledged
the
assistance
he
had
gotten
lanier
attributed
this
to
the
potential
blowback
that
an
african-american
celebrity
like
rocky
could
face
for
embracing
trump
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
as
a
culture
and
i'm
talking
about
black
americans
is
herd
mentality
lanier
said
right
now
it's
popular
for
those
guys
to
bash
president
trump
the
two
men
said
they
were
left
disappointed
that
rocky
didn't
thank
the
white
house
even
behind
the
scenes
all
he
had
to
do
was
do
a
two-minute
call
to
say
thank
you
said
scott
rocky
hasn't
even
called
us
and
said
hey
man
thank
