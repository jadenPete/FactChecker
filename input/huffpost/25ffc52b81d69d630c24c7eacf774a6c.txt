anthony
scaramucci
says
he
was
wrong
about
trump
in
blistering
washington
post
op-ed
the
mooch
said
he
isn't
seeking
absolution
but
felt
it
was
time
to
warn
voters
that
trump
shouldn't
be
re-elected
anthony
scaramucci
the
short-lived
white
house
communications
director
deepened
his
criticism
of
president
donald
trump
in
an
op-ed
on
monday
evening
i'm
not
seeking
absolution
i
just
want
to
be
part
of
the
solution
scaramucci
who
was
fired
in
july
after
just
days
on
the
job
wrote
in
the
washington
post
the
negatives
of
trump's
demagoguery
now
clearly
outweigh
the
positives
of
his
leadership
and
it
is
imperative
that
americans
unite
to
prevent
him
from
serving
another
four
years
in
office
i
made
a
mistake
supporting
realdonaldtrump
i
don't
need
to
be
absolved
of
that
but
now
i
will
do
what
it
takes
to
help
make
things
right

anthony
scaramucci
scaramucci
august
trump
and
scaramucci
have
been
exchanging
barbs
for
weeks
as
the
former
aide
went
on
a
sweeping
media
blitz
scaramucci
compared
the
president
to
the
chernobyl
nuclear
disaster
on
axios
called
him
a
jackass
and
a
paper
tiger
in
vanity
fair
and
told
msnbc
that
trump's
recent
efforts
to
address
a
spate
of
mass
shootings
were
a
catastrophe
he
also
predicted
that
trump
would
drop
out
of
the
presidential
race
by
march
as
he
realized
the
tide
of
discontent
had
grown
against
him
trump
has
not
taken
these
comments
well
attacking
scaramucci
in
turn
and
saying
the
former
aide
would
do
anything
to
come
back
to
the
white
house
anthony
scaramucci
who
was
quickly
terminated
days
from
a
position
that
he
was
totally
incapable
of
handling
now
seems
to
do
nothing
but
television
as
the
all
time
expert
on
president
trump
like
many
other
so-called
television
experts
he
knows
very
little
about
me
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
other
than
the
fact
that
this
administration
has
probably
done
more
than
any
other
administration
in
its
first
years
of
existence
anthony
who
would
do
anything
to
come
back
in
should
remember
the
only
reason
he
is
on
tv
and
it's
not
for
being
the
mooch
donald
j.
trump
realdonaldtrump
august
until
recently
scaramucci
had
been
an
ardent
supporter
of
trump
and
his
policies
regularly
appearing
on
television
to
champion
the
president
but
those
days
are
over
he
wrote
in
the
post
my
public
praise
of
the
man
was
over
the
top
at
times
but
my
private
estimation
of
him
was
more
measured
i
thought
trump
despite
his
warts
could
bring
a
pragmatic
entrepreneurial
approach
to
the
oval
office
scaramucci
wrote
i
thought
he
could
be
the
reset
button
washington
needed
to
break
through
the
partisan
sclerosis
i
thought
he
would
govern
in
a
more
inclusive
way
than
his
campaign
rhetoric
might
have
indicated
and
i
naively
thought
that
by
joining
the
administration
i
could
counteract
the
far-right
voices
in
the
room
i
thought
wrong
and
yes
many
of
you
told
me
so
scaramucci
went
on
to
list
the
moments
trump
lost
him
as
a
supporter
saying
his
disapproval
had
been
mounting
for
years
as
the
president
failed
to
lambaste
a
neo-nazi
march
in
charlottesville
virginia
and
supported
policies
to
separate
migrant
children
from
their
families
as
the
southern
border
i
broke
from
trump
because
not
only
has
his
behavior
become
more
erratic
and
his
rhetoric
more
inflammatory
but
also
because
like
all
demagogues
he
is
incapable
of
handling
constructive
criticism
as
we
lie
on
the
bed
of
nails
trump
has
made
it's
often
difficult
to
see
how
much
the
paradigm
of
acceptable
conduct
has
shifted
scaramucci
wrote
for
the
republican
party
it's
now
a
question
of
whether
we
want
to
start
cleaning
up
the
mess
or
continue
papering
over
the
cracks
