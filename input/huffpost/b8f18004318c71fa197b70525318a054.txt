sen
tom
cotton
r-ark
claims
he
was
one
of
the
first
people
to
bring
up
the
idea
of
the
u.s.
purchasing
greenland
with
president
donald
trump
and
even
proposed
it
to
denmark
last
year
the
danish
ambassador
who
spoke
with
cotton
in
august
lars
gert
lose
was
caught
a
little
off
guard
by
the
thought
a
spokeswoman
for
the
senator
told
the
wall
street
journal
on
thursday
it
is
unclear
whether
cotton
was
the
first
to
pitch
the
idea
to
trump
who
confirmed
last
weekend
that
he
had
been
mulling
it
over
the
senator's
spokeswoman
told
the
washington
post
that
cotton
brought
it
up
in
a
conversation
with
the
president
more
than
a
year
ago
cotton
defended
the
idea
at
a
luncheon
this
week
hosted
by
an
arkansas-based
website
talk
business
politics
where
he
was
asked
why
the
u.s.
might
want
to
buy
greenland
you're
joking
but
i
can
reveal
to
you
that
several
months
ago
i
met
with
the
danish
ambassador
and
i
proposed
that
they
sell
greenland
to
us
cotton
told
the
event
moderator
it's
obviously
the
right
decision
for
the
united
states
and
anyone
who
can't
see
that
is
blinded
by
trump
derangement
he
added
the
arkansas
democrat-gazette
reported
associated
press
greenland
may
become
more
important
in
global
trade
routes
in
the
coming
decades
due
to
melting
arctic
ice
he
also
defended
the
idea
to
the
wall
street
journal
saying
it
would
be
a
good
military
strategy
in
the
last
few
years
china
effectively
tried
to
gain
a
military
foothold
in
greenland
by
offering
financing
for
airport
construction
he
told
the
newspaper
purchasing
it
would
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
both
the
chinese
and
the
russians
and
it
is
rich
in
natural
resources
with
untold
economic
potential
proponents
of
the
idea
have
argued
that
valuable
shipping
routes
being
opened
by
melting
arctic
ice
may
fall
into
russian
or
chinese
control
but
that
the
u.s.
could
prevent
that
through
ownership
of
greenland
greenland
however
is
an
autonomous
nation
that
is
part
of
the
kingdom
of
denmark
news
that
trump
had
thought
about
purchasing
it
was
met
with
surprise
and
mockery
over
the
weekend
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
called
the
idea
absurd
greenland
is
not
for
sale
she
said
earlier
this
week
thankfully
the
time
where
you
buy
and
sell
other
countries
and
populations
is
over
in
response
trump
canceled
a
planned
visit
to
denmark
next
month
i
thought
the
prime
minister's
statement
that
it
was
an
absurd
idea
was
nasty
the
president
said
wednesday
all
she
had
to
do
was
say
no
we
wouldn't
be
interested
previously
trump
had
said
in
a
tweet
that
he
appreciated
the
prime
minister's
candor
greenland's
foreign
minister
ane
lone
bagger
also
panned
the
idea
we
are
open
for
business
but
we're
not
for
sale
