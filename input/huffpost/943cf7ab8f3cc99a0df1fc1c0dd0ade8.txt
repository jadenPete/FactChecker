trump
this
isn't
the
people's
republic
of
america
the
editorial
slammed
trump's
imperious
order
to
u.s.
businesses
blowing
a
gasket
and
tanking
stocks
in
no-win
trade
war
with
china
the
wall
street
journal
gave
president
donald
trump
a
stiff
word-lashing
friday
for
ratcheting
up
his
no-win
trade
war
with
china
the
trouble
with
trade
wars
like
shooting
wars
is
that
once
they
start
you
never
know
how
they're
going
to
end
the
journal
noted
in
an
editorial
scorching
trump
the
enemy
gets
a
vote
and
sometimes
events
escalate
in
ugly
fashion
take
friday
which
saw
china
retaliate
for
donald
trump's
recent
tariffs
mr
trump
blow
a
gasket
markets
tank
and
mr
trump
impose
even
more
tariffs
the
newspaper
said
trump
then
began
tweeting
like
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
and
scoffed
at
his
order
that
american
companies
no
longer
have
anything
to
do
with
the
world's
second-largest
economy
order
somebody
should
tell
chairman
trump
this
isn't
the
people's
republic
of
america
the
editorial
added
u.s.
businesses
have
been
trying
to
shift
production
out
of
china
to
avoid
tariffs
but
supply
chains
that
have
been
developed
over
decades
can't
be
uprooted
overnight
and
no
other
country
has
china's
huge
relatively
skilled
workforce
infrastructure
and
network
of
suppliers
the
newspaper
noted
the
editorial
mocked
trump's
trade-war
general
peter
navarro
and
his
laughable
advice
to
the
stock
market
that
we're
cool
here
the
editors
scoffed
got
that
markets
just
chill
baby
instead
the
newspaper
warned
markets
are
wondering
if
we're
heading
toward
mutual
assured
economic
destruction
in
a
final
dig
the
editorial
asked
what
was
that
again
about
trade
wars
being
easy
to
win
