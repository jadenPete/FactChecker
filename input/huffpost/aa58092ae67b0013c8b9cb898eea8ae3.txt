some
people
noted
how
the
trump
administration
of
which
she
is
a
part
had
only
last
week
weakened
the
endangered
species
act
protecting
threatened
animals
and
plants
others
pointed
out
how
her
father's
immigration
policies
have
separated
families
on
the
u.s.
mexico
border
and
that
her
brothers
donald
trump
jr
and
eric
trump
have
previously
hunted
big-game
animals
on
safari
in
africa
umm
since
you
seem
to
like
nature
could
you
tell
daddy
to
leave
our
endangered
species
alone
and
lay
off
the
bees
he's
taking
it
a
little
far
to
get
even
with

wow
look
at
that
beautiful
sky
those
amazing
trees
and
lovely

all
being
destroyed
because
your

refuses

so
happy
you
get
to
enjoy
nature
future
generations
won't
get
that
opportunity
after
your
father
destroys
any
and
all
environmental
protections
but

so
how
does
this
nature-loving
tweet
square
with
daddy's
roll
back
of
pollution
standards
weakening
epa
cancelling
the
endangered

act

that's
actually
a
sweet
picture
and
makes
me
wish
i
was
less
furious
about
you
and
your

having
a

in

that
you're
manifestly
unqualified

ememess
august
don't
worry
your
father
and
this
administration
are
working
hard
to
sell
all
our
wild
things
off
to
the
highest
bidder
that
spot
you're
standing
should
be
some
