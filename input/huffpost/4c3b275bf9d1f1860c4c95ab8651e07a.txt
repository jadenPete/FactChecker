prison
sentence
over
his
involvement
in
payments
to
stormy
daniels
and
karen
mcdougal
congressional
democrats
plan
to
open
an
inquiry
into
claims
that
president
donald
trump
was
involved
in
hush
money
payments
to
two
women
during
the
election
according
to
a
report
monday
evening
in
the
washington
post
the
outlet
citing
people
familiar
with
the
plans
notes
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
may
soon
hold
hearings
with
witnesses
linked
to
the
payments
as
early
as
october
when
lawmakers
are
back
from
their
summer
recess
the
probe
would
focus
on
payments
made
to
adult
film
star
stormy
daniels
and
former
playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
both
women
claim
they
had
affairs
with
the
president
before
he
was
elected
but
were
paid
off
in
by
people
linked
to
the
trump
campaign
so
their
stories
wouldn't
damage
his
bid
for
the
white
house
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
reply
to
huffpost's
request
for
comment
on
the
reports
jay
sekulow
the
president's
personal
attorney
told
the
post
that
trump
did
not
engage
in
any
campaign
violations
the
payment
to
daniels
was
arranged
by
trump's
longtime
attorney
and
former
fixer
michael
cohen
who
is
currently
serving
a
three-year
sentence
for
campaign
finance
charges
and
other
crimes
during
his
trial
cohen
testified
that
trump
ordered
him
to
pay
in
hush
money
to
daniels
he
later
told
congress
that
he
was
reimbursed
by
trump
after
he
was
elected
to
office
showing
lawmakers
two
copies
of
checks
that
cohen
received
including
one
signed
by
the
president
himself
cohen
also
helped
broker
a
deal
between
mcdougal
and
the
parent
company
of
the
national
enquirer
american
media
inc
to
pay
her
off
as
part
of
a
catch
and
kill
effort
trump
has
denied
the
affairs
took
place
and
distanced
himself
from
the
payments
at
times
saying
he
didn't
even
know
about
them
his
attorney
rudy
giuliani
later
said
he
reimbursed
cohen
but
didn't
know
the
specifics
of
the
payments
however
cohen
told
prosecutors
during
his
trial
that
he
had
blind
loyalty
to
the
president
at
the
time
and
was
being
sentenced
because
of
it
noting
that
he
was
going
to
jail
in
part
because
of
my
decision
to
help
mr
trump
hide
that
payment
from
the
american
people
before
they
voted
a
few
days
later
a
judge
said
in
july
that
the
federal
investigation
into
cohen
and
any
potential
campaign
finance
violations
was
closed
but
the
post
notes
democrats
believe
there
is
enough
evidence
to
begin
their
own
probe
and
potentially
name
the
president
himself
as
a
co-conspirator
in
the
crimes
that
resulted
in
cohen's
sentence
any
potential
wrongdoing
would
only
further
democratic
efforts
to
bring
articles
of
impeachment
against
trump
and
build
on
what
special
counsel
robert
mueller
said
were
five
instances
of
potential
obstruction
of
justice
during
the
investigation
into
the
election
should
lawmakers
open
their
own
inquiry
they
may
consider
speaking
with
ami
chief
executive
david
pecker
a
longtime
friend
of
the
president
the
post
reported
more
than
house
democrats
have
called
for
an
impeachment
inquiry
but
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
has
continued
to
resist
such
calls
last
month
pelosi
said
once
again
that
the
public
didn't
yet
support
impeachment
saying
that
congress
role
was
to
be
unifying
and
not
dividing
if
and
when
we
act
people
will
know
he
gave
us
no
choice
the
speaker
told
fellow
lawmakers
several
weeks
ago
per
a
report
by
the
associated
press
