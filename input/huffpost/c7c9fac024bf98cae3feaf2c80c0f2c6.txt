steve
king's
campaign
is
running
dry
as
pacs
and
politicians
jump
ship
the
iowa
republican
has
less
than
in
reported
cash
on
hand
rep
steve
king
r-iowa
who
has
all
but
politically
self-destructed
by
supporting
white
supremacy
promoting
neo-nazis
on
twitter
and
most
recently
suggesting
there
would
be
no
human
race
without
rape
and
incest
appears
to
be
nearly
broke
data
from
opensecrets
an
initiative
of
the
center
for
responsive
politics
shows
that
the
congressman's
reelection
campaign
committee
had
just
in
cash
on
hand
as
of
june
and
hasn't
filed
another
report
since
king
has
raised
a
total
of
most
of
which
came
from
individuals
and
spent
federal
election
commission
data
shows
that
in
the
first
quarter
of
king's
campaign
operated
at
a
deficit
of
about
more
than
half
of
his
individual
donors
gave
less
than
and
political
action
committee
contributions
totaled
a
mere
accounting
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
his
overall
funds
according
to
the
daily
beast
which
first
flagged
the
numbers
king
hasn't
received
any
contributions
from
any
pacs
connected
to
sitting
members
of
congress
and
corporate
pacs
have
spurned
him
too
meanwhile
one
of
king's
challengers
republican
randy
feenstra
has
raised
and
spent
only
the
rest
of
which
was
listed
as
cash
on
hand
as
of
june
though
they've
raised
significantly
less
overall
two
of
king's
other
gop
challengers
bret
richards
and
jeremy
taylor
also
have
more
cash
on
hand
with
and
respectively
the
eventual
end
of
king's
tenure
in
congress
has
become
increasingly
likely
especially
after
he
asked
the
new
york
times
in
january
why
the
terms
white
nationalist
and
white
supremacist
are
offensive
generating
bipartisan
backlash
the
latest
scandal
regarding
his
comments
to
