most
blatant
lies
kellyanne
conway's
husband
made
a
mocking
hashtag
that
exposed
trump's
untruths
trend
on
twitter
twitter
was
awash
with
president
donald
trump's
lies
early
saturday
thanks
in
part
to
conservative
attorney
george
conway
the
lawyer
helped
the
presidentpinocchiostoplies
hashtag
trend
on
the
social

platform
after
preet
bharara
the
former
u.s.
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
who
was
fired
by
trump
in
asked
followers
to
identify
trump's
most
demonstrably
provable
intentional
lie
as
potus
conway
who
has
become
a
fierce
critic
of
the
president
despite
his
wife
kellyanne
conway's
role
as
white
house
counselor
suggested
it
would
be
a
way
tie
by
the
washington
post's
reckoning
trump
has
so
far
told
more
than
lies
since
taking
office
in
january
there's
going
to
be
a

conway
shared
some
examples
of
trump's
tallest
tales
but
okay
how
about
when
he
claimed
that
he
didn't
say
tim
apple
but
actually
said
tim
cook
apple
really
fast
which
of
course
he
didn't
and
then
when
everyone
laughed
at
him
because
it
was
on
tape
he
said
he
intentionally
said
tim
apple
to
save
time

there
was
the
insane
lie
trump
told
in
front
of
the
pakistani
pm
that
pm
modi
of
india
had
asked
trump
to
mediate
kashmir
which
no
indian
gov't
would
ever
do
india
flipped
out
basically
calling
trump
a
liar

then
there
was
the
time
in
the
course
of
lying
his
ass
off
about
some
internal
campaign
polls
trump
told
george

that
i
like

i'm
actually
a
