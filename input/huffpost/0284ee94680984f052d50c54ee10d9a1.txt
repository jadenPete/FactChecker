washington
gov
jay
inslee
d-wash

gardner
r-colo
a
race
that
democrats
hope
will
be
competitive
moulton
has
been
critical
of
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
d-calif
and
other
house
democratic
leaders
for
infighting
rather
than
focusing
on
impeaching
president
donald
trump
last
year
he
led
a
challenge
to
pelosi's
speakership
earning
opposition
from
some
of
his
own
constituents
our
leadership
is
failing
on
two
counts
dividing
our
caucus
and
being
unwilling
to
start
impeachment
proceedings
against
donald
trump
moulton
told
huffpost
in
an
interview
last
month
and
that
was
most
evident
this
weekend
because
all
of
this
ridiculous
infighting
in
the
house
pales
in
comparison
to
what
this
white
house
is
doing
in
an
interview
with
the
washington
post
on
thursday
moulton
who
positioned
himself
as
a
centrist
and
criticized
progressive
proposals
like
medicare
for
all
said
it's
evident
now
that
this
is
essentially
a
three-way
race
with
former
vice
president
joe
biden
and
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
moulton
said
he
was
not
prepared
to
endorse
anyone
yet
but
said
biden
would
make
a
fantastic
president
calling
the
former
vice
president
a
mentor
and
a
friend
