an

to
indefinitely

a

group
is
insisting
that
children
should
not
be
kept
in
jail-like
detention
facilities
while
courts
review
their
families
asylum
cases
a
process
that
could
take

world
relief's
u.s.
director
of
church
mobilization
told
huffpost
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
u.s.
now
depends
on
foster
care
instead
of
orphanages
to
care
for
children
who
can't
live
with
their
biological
parents
we
know
that
holding
kids
in
a
facility
for
significant
amounts
of
time
is
harmful
to
them

world
relief
is
urging
fellow
christians
to
contact
their
local
members
of
congress
to
speak
out
against
the
new
detainment
policy
which
is
scheduled
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
on
friday
american
evangelicals
concern
for
asylum-seekers
should
be
rooted
in
the
bible's
teachings
soerens
said
we
believe
that
all
human
beings
are
made
in
god's
image
and
thus
that
all
human
life
has
dignity
and
value
so
we
have
to
stand
up
for
asylum
laws
designed
to
ensure
that
our
government
never
sends
any
person
back
to
a
situation
where
they
could
be
harmed
or
even
killed
he
said
that
does
not
mean
we
let
everyone
in
not
everyone
is
in
that
category
he
added
but
it
means
we
must
offer
due
process
and
treat
everyone
humanely
in
the
process
which
excludes
detaining
children
for
long
periods
of
time
the
trump
administration's
move
seeks
to
end
the
flores
agreement
a
court
settlement
that
established
basic
standards
for
migrant
children
in
the
government's
care
the
administration's
new
rule
would
allow
the
government
to
detain
migrant
children
indefinitely
rather
than
for
days
which
is
the
current
limit
the
rule
which
still
needs
to
be
approved
by
a
federal
judge
is
likely
to
immediately
face
court
challenges
experts
say
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
also
faces
logistical
hurdles
it
doesn't
yet
have
the
bed
space
to
accommodate
the
record-numbers
of
families
crossing
into
the
u.s.
the
white
house's
new
strategy
aims
to
deter
central
american
parents
from
crossing
into
the
united
states
with
their
children
but
soerens
insists
that
there
are
more
humane
alternatives
to
indefinite
detention
such
as
family
case
management
programs
where
migrants
live
outside
detention
centers
and
are
assigned
social
workers
to
help
them
navigate
the
court
system
secure
housing
and
schooling
for
their
kids
outside
of
detention
asylum-seekers
are
often
supported
by
extended
family
members
and
by
local
churches
and
nonprofits
it's
also
easier
for
these
migrants
to
access
legal
services
which
could
be
crucial
to
their
asylum
cases
a
trac
immigration
study
found
that
most
migrant
families
released
from
custody
especially
those
who
have
legal
representation
show

however
world
relief's
welcoming
stance
towards
asylum
seekers
may
not
be
shared
by
many
evangelicals
in
the
pews
particularly
white
evangelicals
unlike
members
of
any
other
major
religious
group
the
majority
of
white
evangelicals
believe
immigrants
represent
a
threat
to
american
customs
and
values
according
to
a
survey
from
the
public
religion
research
institute
the
survey
also
found
many
are
supportive
of
president
donald
trump's
plans
to
build
a
wall
along
the
southern
u.s.
border
according
to
the
pew
research
center
of
white
evangelicals
surveyed
also
claim
the
u.s.
does
not
have
a
responsibility
to
accept
refugees
soerens
said
he
believes
many
evangelicals
haven't
thought
through
what
the
bible
has
to
say
about
asylum-seekers
policies
that
effectively
keep
immigrants
from
entering
the
u.s.
pending
their
asylum
hearings
actually
limit
the
ability
of
local
churches
to
show
love
to
their
newest
neighbors
and
practice
biblical
hospitality
soerens
said
these
policies
could
also
have
an
impact
on
one
of
evangelicals
most
central
and
defining
missions
soerens
suggested
the
evangelization
of
the
gospel
it
limits
our
ability
to
follow
the
biblical
command
to
make
disciples
of
all
nations
because
most
american
christians
are
less
likely
to
interact
with
people
of
different
nationalities
when
they're
kept
out
of
the
u.s.
or
held
in
a
detention
facility
that

tuesday

last

as

spread
that
the

administration
was
separating
migrant
children
from
their

leading
voices
within
the
american
evangelical

community
began
speaking
out
including
some
who
are
usually
strongly
supportive
of

donald
trump's
policies
the
zero-tolerance
family
separation
policy
was
later
rescinded
soerens
said
he
hopes
the
american
evangelical
community
will
respond
similarly
to
the
administration's
latest
policy
move
i
hope
we
see
a
significant
number
of
evangelical
christians
insisting
that
this
change
is
not
acceptable
because
we
believe
that
children
need
to
