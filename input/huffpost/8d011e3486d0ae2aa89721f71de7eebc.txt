donald
trump's
last
hours
have
been
particularly
stupid
and
offensive
and
weird
the
president
attacked
democratic-voting
jews
called
himself
the
chosen
one
and
got
mad
that
denmark
won't
sell
him
greenland
president
donald
trump
is
known
for
making
dumb
and
offensive
remarks
that
diminish
the
country's
standing
with
the
rest
of
the
world
but
tuesday
and
wednesday
have
been
an
embarrassment
of
bizarre
riches
even
by
his
usual
standards
let's
review
he's
super
mad
he
can't
buy
greenland
the
adult
u.s.
president
tweeted
tuesday
night
that
he
was
canceling
a
meeting
with
danish
prime
minister
mette
frederiksen
after
finding
out
she
would
not
engage
in
a
conversation
about
his
desire
to
buy
greenland
it
began
last
week
when
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
trump
was
having
serious
talks
with
white
house
staff
about
buying
the
territory
from
denmark
when
asked
about
it
on
sunday
trump
seemed
confident
he
could
make
a
deal
for
a
prize
that
doesn't
belong
to
the
u.s.
and
that
no
one
asked
for
denmark
essentially
owns
it
trump
told
reporters
we're
very
good
allies
with
denmark
we
protect
denmark
like
we
protect
large
portions
of
the
world
strategically
it's
interesting
frederiksen
shut
down
the
idea
immediately
greenland
is
not
danish
she
wrote
in
an
article
for
the
newspaper
sermitsiaq
greenland
belongs
to
greenland
i
strongly
hope
that
this
is
not
meant
seriously
but
it
was
apparently
meant
seriously
and
once
trump
realized
he'd
never
get
greenland
he
canceled
his
scheduled
trip
to
denmark
posting
on
twitter
that
it
was
because
frederiksen
has
no
interest
in
discussing
the
purchase
of
greenland
he
made
more
anti-semitic
remarks
trump
leaned
hard
into
his
trademark
anti-semitism
on
wednesday
morning
when
he
suggested
jewish
people
who
vote
for
democrats
are
disloyal
if
you
vote
for
a
democrat
you're
being
disloyal
to
jewish
people
and
you're
being
very
disloyal
to
israel
the
president
told
reporters
outside
the
white
house
only
weak
people
would
say
anything
other
than
that
the
statement
was
a
doubling
down
of
comments
he'd
made
a
day
prior
while
attacking
reps
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
and
ilhan
omar
d-minn
who
have
leveled
criticisms
at
israel's
government
i
think
any
jewish
people
that
vote
for
a
democrat
i
think
it
shows
either
a
total
lack
of
knowledge
or
great
disloyalty
trump
said
about
of
jewish
voters
voted
for
democratic
candidates
in
the
midterm
elections
according
to
the
pew
research
center
so
that's
trump
calling
in
american
jews
either
ignorant
or
disloyal
later
trump
tweeted
out
a
lengthy
quote
from
conspiracy
theorist
wayne
allyn
root
that
said
he
was
the
greatest
president
for
jews
and
for
israel
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
that
the
jewish
people
in
israel
love
him
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
and
speaking
of
a
god
complex
he
called
himself
the
chosen
one
speaking
to
reporters
outside
the
white
house
on
wednesday
trump
blamed
the
media
for
reporting
on
the
possibility
of
a
looming
recession
defended
a
failing
trade
war
against
china
and
called
himself
the
chosen
one
while
looking
up
at
the
sky
the
fake
news
of
which
many
of
you
are
members
is
trying
to
convince
the
public
to
have
a
recession
trump
said
let's
have
a
recession
the
united
states
is
doing
phenomenally
well
but
one
thing
i
have
to
do
is
economically
take
on
china
because
china
has
been
ripping
us
off
for
many
years
he
said
his
life
would
be
easier
if
he
hadn't
decided
to
embark
on
a
trade
war
with
china
then
tried
to
deny
responsibility
saying
this
isn't
my
trade
war
the
president
then
looked
up
in
the
sky
and
said
i
am
the
chosen
one
so
i'm
taking
on
china
i'm
taking
on
china
on
trade
and
you
know
what
we're
winning
again
we're
not
he
reversed
on
gun
control
and
payroll
tax
cuts
trump
made
clear
he
is
still
in
the
pocket
of
the
national
rifle
association
when
he
walked
back
a
sensible
gun
control
measure
that
would
require
stronger
background
checks
we
need
intelligent
background
checks
ok
this
isn't
a
question
of
nra
republican
or
democrat
trump
said
earlier
this
month
following
multiple
mass
shootings
that
left
a
combined
people
dead
we
don't
want
insane
people
mentally
ill
people
bad
people
dangerous
people
we
don't
want
guns
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
people
but
trump
later
spoke
to
nra
chief
executive
wayne
lapierre
and
assured
him
that
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
as
the
atlantic
reported
tuesday
the
day
trump
spoke
to
lapierre
he
also
walked
back
his
language
to
reporters
in
the
oval
office
we
have
missing
areas
and
areas
that
don't
complete
the
whole
circle
and
we're
looking
at
different
things
trump
said
and
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
is
a
mental
problem
and
i've
said
it
a
hundred
times
it's
not
the
gun
that
pulls
the
trigger
it's
the
people
he
later
denied
ever
saying
universal
background
checks
were
off
the
table
and
this
wednesday
trump
said
he
would
not
cut
taxes
to
help
battle
an
economic
slowdown
just
one
day
after
saying
the
opposite
cnbc
reported
i'm
not
looking
at
a
tax
cut
now
trump
told
reporters
wednesday
we
don't
need
it
we
have
a
strong
economy
but
with
the
possibility
of
a
recession
growing
and
trump's
tweets
attacking
the
federal
reserve
the
economy
may
not
look
good
for
long
meanwhile
amid
the
absurdity
of
the
past
hours
trump
and
his
administration
have
continued
to
methodically
gut
environmental
protections
trample
civil
liberties
and
keep
kids
in
cages
indefinitely
but
he'll
probably
start
acting
presidential
any
day
now
