bill
maher
celebrated
the
death
of
billionaire
david
koch
on
real
time
friday
night
telling
his
audience
that
he
is
glad
koch
died
and
that
he
hoped
the
end
was
painful
yesterday
david
koch
of
the
zillionaire
koch
brothers
died
of
prostate
cancer
i
guess
i'm
going
to
have
to
re-evaluate
my
low
opinion
of
prostate
cancer
maher
said
drawing
applause
from
the
crowd
he
was
but
his
family
says
they
wish
he
could
live
longer
but
at
least
he
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
amazon
catch
fire
he
added
condolences
poured
in
from
all
the
politicians
he
owned
and
mourners
have
been
asked
in
lieu
of
flowers
to
just
leave
their
car
engines
running
as
for
his
remains
he's
been
asked
to
be
cremated
and
have
his
ashes
blown
into
a
child's
lungs
now
i
know
these
may
seem
like
harsh
words
and
harsh
jokes
and
i'm
sure
i
will
be
condemned
for
them
on
fox
news
which
will
portray
mr
koch
as
a
principled
libertarian
who
believed
in
the
free
market
maher
continued
he
and
his
brother
have
done
more
than
anybody
to
fund
climate-science
deniers
for
decades
so
f
k
him
the
amazon
is
burning
up
maher
said
i'm
glad
he's
dead
and
i
hope
the
end
was
painful
monologue
get
on
my
lawn
real
time
with
bill
maher
hbo
youtu
be
maher
was
not
the
only
high-profile
liberal
to
celebrate
koch's
death
others
like
bette
midler
rejoiced
over
koch's
passing
however
although
the
media
will
remember
koch
for
funding
republican
politicians
and
conservative
causes
koch
would
be
more
aptly
remembered
as
a
libertarian
who
both
advocated
for
a
free
market
and
socially
liberal
causes
indeed
in
koch
declared
himself
a
social
liberal
