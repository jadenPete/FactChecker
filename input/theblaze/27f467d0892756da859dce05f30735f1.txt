his
decision
he's
begun
to
consider
a
run
for
the
u.s.
senate
cbs
news
reported
that
the
same
day
kennedy
filed
a
statement
of
candidacy
and
a
principal
campaign
committee
for
a
u.s.
senate
run
if
kennedy
does
run
he
would
be
taking
on
year-old
incumbent
sen
ed
markey
who
has
already
said
he
will
seek
reelection
markey
served
several
years
in
the
house
of
representatives
before
joining
the
senate
in
in
a
special
election
to
replace
former
sen
john
kerry
d
markey
has
been
a
staunch
proponent
of
cutting

and
co-sponsored
the
widely
criticized
and

green
new

reuters
reported
that
while
markey
won
election
with
a
comfortable
margin
kennedy
could
potentially
give
markey
one
of
the
toughest
races
of
his
political
career
according
to
cnn
markey
told
the
new
york
times
he
will
fight
to
keep
his
seat
regardless
of
whether
kennedy
launches
a
senate
run
the
times
jonathan
martin
said
of
the
potential
kennedy
challenge
that
would
create
a
titanic
match
between
two
well-known
figures
in
that
state
and
increasingly
people
think
that
as
long
as
kennedy
keeps
this
door
open
he
probably
is
going
to
have
to
run
because
pulling
back
will
show
weakness
for
a
future
race
and
if
you
don't
run
now
the
lines
aren't
going
to
be
any
shorter
down
the
road
in
a
state
full
of
liberals
anything
else
kennedy
gained
national
attention
when
he
delivered
the
democratic
rebuttal
to
president
donald
trump's
state
of
the
union
speech
last
year
but
not
all
the
attention
was
positive
the
congressman
had
a
noticeable
amount
of
shine
around
his
mouth
during
his
televised
address
leading
critics
to
accuse
him
of
having
drool
on
his
face
rep
kennedy

told

the
sheen
