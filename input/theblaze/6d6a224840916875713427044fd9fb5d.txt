andrew
luck
reminds
us
all
of
the
importance
of
courage
toughness
and
the
willingness
to
fight
until
we
have
nothing
left
his
brothers
in
arms
understood
that
he
sacrificed
himself
for
them
football
isn't
for
quitters
that's
one
of
the
reasons
people
love
it
so
much
courage
and
toughness
are
absolutely
essential
to
play
it
try
to
fake
that
and
you
lose
more
than
that
you
will
deserve
to
lose
such
are
the
lessons
i'm
trying
to
teach
my
seventh-grade
son
as
he
embarks
on
his
first
season
of
tackle
football
it's
the
first
time
as
a
dad
i've
put
my
thumb
on
the
scales
and
made
him
do
an
activity
he
wasn't
certain
of
while
he's
played
flag
football
for
several
years
and
is
certainly
interested
in
playing
tackle
football
on
some
level
without
my
insistence
he
has
also
shown
some
hesitancy
to
move
forward
with
such
an
intense
and
physical
commitment
he
is
in
some
sense
afraid
of
what
is
to
come
that
is
totally
understandable
but
it
is
also
something
that
he
simply
can't
give
in
to
not
because
this
is
about
football
but
because
this
is
about
life
ours
is
to
enter
through
the
narrow
gate
not
the
path
of
least
resistance
we
must
struggle
we
must
fight
we
must
overcome
be
not
afraid
if
my
son
can
do
that
on
the
football
field
he'll
have
a
much
better
chance
of
doing
that
in
all
other
walks
of
life
as
a
man
a
husband
and
a
father
he
will
be
a
leader
not
a
sheep
he'll
be
a
dude
in
full
a
dude
like
colts
quarterback
andrew
luck
not
only
did
that
guy
not
quit
like
some
are
saying
in
recent
days
but
he
fulfilled
the
promise
of
playing
football
as
much
as
any
player
possibly
could
he
gave
so
much
of
himself
by
setting
aside
fear
in
the
face
of
multiple
severe
injuries
including
one
of
his
bodily
organs
over
the
course
of
a
seven-year
career
and
fought
until
he
simply
couldn't
fight
any
longer
his
brothers
in
arms
in
the
locker
room
seem
to
universally
believe
that
even
though
luck
is
leaving
them
in
a
tough
spot
with
the
season
right
around
the
corner
how
ridiculous
then
that
the
fanboy
who
would
wet
himself
if
he
had
to
miss
watching
a
single
minute
of
his
beloved
team
is
nonetheless
holding
it
against
luck
for
finding
it
incredibly
difficult
to
find
the
right
time
to
let
go
of
the
game
he
literally
sacrificed
his
body
for
those
who
booed
andrew
luck
upon
hearing
about
his
retirement
need
to
reflect
on
that
and
realized
they
were
blessed
to
have
him
as
the
face
of
their
franchise
for
the
time
he
was
there
and
those
who
are
doubling
down
on
the
notion
that
luck
is
somehow
weak
or
disloyal
for
the
leaving
the
game
at
this
time
are
simply
jerks
who
are
doing
life
wrong
your
idols
are
consuming
you
sure
i
love
football
as
much
as
anyone
football
season
is
my
second-favorite
time
of
the
year
after
christmas
not
to
mention
football
can
help
teach
you
important
life
lessons
but
it
isn't
the
meaning
of
life
try
to
remember
that
while
you
watch
what
will
almost
certainly
be
less
football
than
i
will
be
watching
this
weekend
because
i
will
be
watching
a
lot
living
in
a
great
country
still
allows
us
that
special
privilege
but
probably
not
for
long
if
we
are
blind
enough
to
tear
down
a
warrior
like
luck
