church
last
night
god
is
pulling
me
through
a
hard
season
having
trust
in

at

worst
times
is
the
absolute
hardest
but
he
is
faithful
to
complete
what
he
started
he
wrote
i
also
want
to
thank
my
wife
for
being
such
a
huge
support
in
my
life
through
this
season
it
says
in
the
bible
count
it
all
joy
when
you
face
trials
of
various
kinds
sounds
insane
considering
when
u
face
trials
u
feel
terrible
he

are
grateful
and
worship
god
for
what
we
do
have
in
that
season
there
is
so
much
power
in
that
whatever
pain
you
are
going
through
just
keep
telling
yourself
this
wont
last

we
in

on

sang

me
through
a
hard
season
having

but
what
else
tmz
also
caught
up
with
the
pop
star
on
thursday
after
he
led
worship
at
the
los
angeles
church
bieber
said
that
performing
at
church
was
way
more
nerve-wracking
than
performing
in
a
concert
for
thousands
of
fans
my
whole
message
at
church
the
other
day
was
there's
power
in
your
weakness
so
when
you
feel
weak
there's
so
many
people
in
this
world
that
are
struggling
there's
just
power
in
weakness
he
said
when
you
fight
through
that
season
you
usually
get
to
the
other
side
and
it
gets
better
