treating

unfairly
ahead
of
upcoming
democratic
debate
rep
gabbard
has
exceeded
support
in
national
and
early
state
polls
is
the
democratic
national
committee
unfairly
stifling
rep
tulsi
gabbard
d-hawaii
one
of
the
most-googled
democratic
candidates
from
participation
in
the
next
democratic
primary
debate
that's
the
question
some
are
asking
as
it
appears
she
will
be
excluded
from
the
next
debate
gabbard
victimized
by
dnc's
dubious
debate
criteria
a
realclearpolitics
headline
states
how
the
dnc
is
unfairly
tilting
the
field
against
tulsi
gabbard
a
headline
in
the
washington
examiner
says
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
gabbard
who
as
a
member
of
the
hawaii
national
guard
recently
returned
from
a
two-week
deployment
to
indonesia
meets
the
debate
qualifications
which
the
dnc
set
to
slowly
crop
the
field
of
candidates
for
the
upcoming
debate
candidates
needed
to
secure
donations
from
unique
donors
and
register
at
least
percent
of
support
in
four
dnc-approved
polls
gabbard
has
registered
at
least
percent
of
support
in
only
two
dnc-approved
polls
despite
generating
as
much
or
more
support
in
total
reputable
polls
her
campaign
says
some
of
which
are
more
accurate
than
the
dnc-approved
surveys
rep
gabbard
has
exceeded
support
in
national
and
early
state
polls
but
only
two
of
them
are
on
the
dnc's
certified
list
many
of
the
uncertified
polls
including
those
conducted
by
highly
reputable
organizations
such
as
the
economist
and
the
boston
globe
are
ranked
by
realclearpolitics
and
fivethirtyeight
as
more
accurate
than
some
dnc
certified
polls
the
campaign
told
the
examiner
in
fact
as
rcp
noted
gabbard
has
registered
at
least
percent
of
support
in
polls
that
the
most
widely
circulated
newspapers
in
new
hampshire
and
south
carolina
endorse
an
important
fact
given
the
early
significance
those
states
play
in
the
primary
yet
the
dnc
for
reasons
unknown
does
not
consider
those
polls
qualified
the
dnc
is
no
stranger
to
accusations
of
bias
in
the
last
election
cycle
democratic
party
leaders
treated
sen
bernie
sanders
vt
and
his
grassroots
campaign
without
partiality
as
hillary
clinton
was
considered
the
general
election
front-runner
and
the
unchallengeable
democratic
nominee
indeed
many
have
since
suggested
the
entire
primary
was
rigged
in
clinton's
favor
given
the
circumstances
this
time
around
with
numerous
candidates
vying
to
challenge
president
donald
trump
in
a
critical
election
one
assumes
the
dnc
would
ensure
no
impropriety
or
scandal
during
the
primary
process
but
as
michael
tracey
wrote
at
rcp
gabbard
will
miss
the
debate
all
but
ensuring
her
campaign
will
end
over
increasingly
absurd
debate
criteria
