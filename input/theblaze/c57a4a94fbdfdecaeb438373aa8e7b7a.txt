wednesday's

an
ongoing
probe
launched
four
years

over
allegations
of
money
intended
for
training
being
redirected
to
line
the
pockets
of
union
officials
how
did
the
uaw
respond
the
uaw
issued
a
statement
wednesday
insisting
that
the
union
and
jones
have
always
fully
cooperated
with
the
government
investigators
in
this
matter
as
the
leader
of
the
uaw
president
jones
is
determined
to
uncover
and
address
any
and
all
wrongdoing
wherever
it
might
lead
there
was
absolutely
no
need
for
search
warrants
to
be
used
by
the
government
today
the
uaw
has
voluntarily
responded
to
every
request
the
government
has
made
throughout
the
course
of
its
investigation
produced
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
documents
and
other
materials
to
the
government
and
most
importantly
when
wrongdoing
has
been
discovered
we
have
taken
strong
action
to
address
it
the
uaw
will
continue
to
cooperate
with
the
government
in
its
investigation
as
we
have
been
doing
throughout
trust
in
uaw
leadership
is
never
more
important
than
during
the
bargaining
process
when
profit-laden
auto
companies
stand
to
benefit
from
media
leaks
false
assumptions
and
political
grandstanding
the
sole
focus
of
president
jones
and
his
team
will
be
winning
at
the
bargaining
table
for
our
members
