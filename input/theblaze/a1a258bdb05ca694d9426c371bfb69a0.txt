reaction
adjunct
professor
jeff
klinzman
will
no
longer
be
employed
at
kirkwood
community
college
in
cedar
rapids
iowa
after
openly
admitting
to
being
a
part
of
antifa
what
are
the
details
according
to
a
campus
reform
report
klinzman
announced
last
week
that
he
supported
the
movement
which
drew
immediate
backlash
kirkwood
community
college
president
lori
sundberg
released
a
friday
statement
that
revealed
the
institution
had
accepted
klinzman's
resignation
which
came
after
the
college
removed
him
from
the
classroom
we
have
spoken
with
mr
klinzman
this
afternoon
about
this
matter
and
have
accepted
his
resignation
a
portion
of
sundberg's
statement
read
with
the
safety
of
our
students
faculty
and
staff
as
our
top
concern
we
made
the
decision
this
morning
to
identify
an
instructor
who
will
take
over
the
one
course
that
mr
klinzman
was
to
have
taught
this
semester
the
statement
added
it
also
acknowledged
that
while
the
decision
may
be
supported
by
some
but
criticized
by
others
it
was
necessary
to
prevent
fostering
a
disruptive
environment
in
the
classroom
the
statement
also
noted
that
while
the
institution
supports
the
professor's
right
to
articulate
his
views
in
whatever
forum
he
chooses
it
was
not
acceptable
for
people
to
perceive
that
he
might
place
public
safety
in
jeopardy
according
to
campus
reform
because
of
the
incident
the
community
college
will
have
an
increased
security
presence
and
will
develop
and
implement
a
safety
plan
the
outlet
reported
that
klinzman
opted
to
resign
rather
than
accept
a
termination
