brave
new
world
is
china's
dystopian
social
credit
system
coming
to
the
us
brought
to
you
by
silicon
valley
on
tuesday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
broke
down
the
details
of
china's
terrifying
social
credit
system
which
controls
chinese
citizens
with
an
individual
score
effected
by
everything
from
jaywalking
to
criticizing
the
government
and
revealed
how
big
tech
is
currently
implementing
similar
systems
here
in
america
since
in
china
the
social
credit
system
has
been
implemented
and
is
evolving
into
a
single
nationwide
point
system
for
all
chinese
citizens
glenn
explained
it
is
akin
to
a
financial
credit
score
it
follows
you
everywhere
there
is
no
place
to
hide
from
the
cameras
it
has
evolved
now
into
a
certain
app
on
your
phone
and
they
monitor
you
every
day
you
take
this
app
you
open
it
up
and
you
have
to
kind
of
take
a
test
about
what
the
great
leader
is
doing
today
it
gives
you
all
the
news
of
what
the
great
leader
and
what
the
communists
are
doing
that
are
so
good
for
you
then
you
have
to
take
a
test
if
you
don't
open
that
app
every
day
your
social
credit
goes
down
if
you're
not
taking
the
test
your
social
credit
goes
down
they
track
you
and
feed
you
everything
they
want
to
feed
you
and
you
must
consume
it
glenn
listed
several
of
the
so-called
transgressions
that
negatively
impact
chinese
citizens
social
scores
such
as
jaywalking
speaking
ill
about
the
country
talking
to
someone
who
has
a
low
social
credit
score
supporting
tibetan
buddhism
excessive
video
gaming
smoking
or
playing
loud
music
on
trains
or
failing
to
sweep
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
your
home
or
store
and
the
punishments
are
harsh
glenn
added
there
are
bans
on
leaving
the
country
bans
on
using
public
transportation
so
all
of
a
sudden
you
get
to
the
bus
and
your
phone
says
offender
not
enough
social
credit
you
have
to
walk
you're
not
taking
a
bus
you
can't
check
into
certain
hotels
you
will
immediately
not
be
hired
for
any
high
visibility
job
your
children
may
be
pulled
out
of
the
private
school
and
may
not
even
make
into
a
public
school
it
can
result
in
slower
internet
connections
and
also
social
stigmatization
because
you
are
now
registered
on
a
public
social
blacklist
your
face
actually
goes
up
on
billboards
electronic
billboards
in
your
neighborhood
and
anybody
who
interacts
with
you
their
social
credit
goes
down
if
you're
thinking
this
all
sounds
frighteningly
like
orwell's
dystopian
just
wait
until
you
hear
what
they've
been
up
to
in
silicon
valley
as
glenn
explains
a
chinese-style
social
credit
system
is
currently
being
implemented
in
america
only
here
it's
being
served
up
with
a
high-tech
smile
in
china
they're
doing
it
by
force
because
of
the
government
china
is
going
this
way
just
as
orwell
predicted
in
glenn
said
but
just
as
brave
new
world
predicted
huxley
said
it
would
come
with
a
big
happy
face
on
it
it
would
come
through
service
and
it
would
be
great
and
you
would
want
this
service
they
were
both
right
one
fits
the
east
huxley
applies
to
us
in
the
west
