here's
what
you
should
know
about
china's
trump
card
in
the
us
stock
market
the
president
of
china
has
his
finger
on
a
massive
launch
button
on
monday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
discussed
what
he
called
the
trump
card
no
pun
intended
the
chinese
communist
party
has
had
up
its
sleeve
since
just
in
case
of
an
economic
war
china's
central
bank
created
trillion
dollars
u.s.
in
off-balance
sheet
currency
between
and
glenn
explained
now
that
trillion
created
from
thin
air
was
loaned
to
chinese
banks
and
government-controlled
companies
it
is
not
counted
on
their
balance
sheet
as
public
debt
it's
actually
being
counted
as
an
asset
since
it's
being
loaned
off
the
balance
sheet
from
the
central
bank
to
the
chinese
this
sounds
bad
for
them
but
an
estimated
trillion
of
that
currency
was
used
to
refinance
zombie
companies
the
other
trillion
was
used
to
invest
in
western
financial
markets
via
offshore
entities
he
continued
which
means
no
one
knows
who
owns
what
stocks
and
bonds
and
funds
of
that
between
and
trillion
the
chinese
took
and
invested
in
our
equities
stocks
all
held
in
these
shell
corporations
that
we
don't
know
another
trillion
was
invested
in
other
western
equities
including
real
estate
stocks
and
bonds
in
march
u.s.
senator
marco
rubio
r-fla
introduced
the
ensuring
quality
information
and
transparency
for
abroad-based
listings
on
our
exchanges
or
equitable
act
which
would
require
any
foreign
corporate
entity
wishing
to
acquire
u.s.
equities
to
report
on
ownership
structure
and
parent
companies
prior
to
executing
an
equity
purchase
explained
glenn
but
the
act
would
not
be
retroactive
he
added
so
the
to
trillion
controlled
by
the
chinese
communist
party
via
the
shell
companies
and
banks
is
already
done
so
what
does
that
all
mean
what
this
means
is
that
the
cold
war
between
us
and
china
could
turn
into
a
very
hot
war
financially
speaking
and
the
president
of
china
has
his
finger
on
a
massive
launch
button
and
that
button
doesn't
say
launch
missiles
doesn't
say
nukes
it
just
says
