a
nashville
tennessee
catholic
school
has
removed
all
copies
of
j.k.
rowling's
harry
potter
series
from
its
shelves
out
of
fear
of
spells
inside
conjuring
evil
spirits
what
are
the
details
the
tennessean
reported
that
students
at
st
edward
catholic
school
will
not
be
able
to
read
the
books
in
school
any
longer
the
rev
dan
reehil
the
school
pastor
reportedly
sent
an
email
out
to
staff
revealing
the
change
after
consulting
with
fellow
pastors
and
exorcists
across
the
u.s.
and
in
rome
these
books
present
magic
as
both
good
and
evil
which
is
not
true
but
in
fact
a
clever
deception
a
portion
of
reehil's
email
read
the
curses
and
spells
used
in
the
books
are
actual
curses
and
spells
which
when
read
by
a
human
being
risk
conjuring
evil
spirits
into
the
presence
of
the
person
reading
the
text
rebecca
hammel
superintendent
of
schools
falling
under
the
catholic
diocese
of
nashville
said
that
the
diocese
doesn't
actually
have
an
official
position
on
books
in
the
harry
potter
series
and
pointed
out
that
each
school
is
responsible
for
setting
its
own
rules
regarding
such
matters
each
pastor
has
canonical
authority
to
make
such
decisions
for
his
parish
school
hammel
said
in
a
statement
reehil
is
well
within
his
authority
to
act
in
that
manner
i
know
that
in
the
process
they
were
going
through
and
kind
of
weeding
out
some
of
the
content
in
hopes
of
sprucing
it
up
and
improving
the
circulation
she
said
hammel
pointed
out
that
the
district
is
not
in
the
business
of
censorship
should
parents
deem
that
this
or
any
other
media
to
be
appropriate
we
would
hope
that
they
would
just
guide
their
sons
and
daughters
to
understand
the
content
through
the
lens
of
our
faith
hammel
said
we
really
don't
get
into
censorship
in
such
selections
other
than
making
sure
that
what
we
put
in
our
school
libraries
is
age
appropriate
materials
for
our
classrooms
what
else
the
school
which
is
a
pre-k
through
th
grade
catholic
school
opened
a
brand-new
library
for
the
school
year
according
to
the
