msnbc's
chris
hayes
unleashes
on
conservatives
over
alleged
simple
truth
about
electoral
college
it
is
deeply
revealing
that
the
entire
conservative
movement
gets
triggered
msnbc
host
chris
hayes
lashed
out
at
conservatives
saturday
after
he
was
sharply
criticized
over
his
recent
commentary
about
the
electoral
college
what
did
hayes
say
hayes
claimed
that
modern
conservatism
is
a
deeply
paranoid
and
pessimistic
movement
that
is
retreating
behind
counter-majoritarian
institutions
he
said
modern
conservatives
desire
to
uphold
minority
rule
what
led
to
hayes
comments
on
his
msnbc
show
friday
hayes
attempted
to
make
the
case
that
the
electoral
college
the
system
established
by
the
founding
fathers
to
elect
the
president
is
undemocratic
the
weirdest
thing
about
the
electoral
college
is
the
fact
that
if
it
wasn't
specifically
in
the
constitution
for
the
presidency
it
would
be
unconstitutional
hayes
said
hayes
point
was
this
beginning
in
the
s
the
supreme
court
started
developing
a
jurisprudence
of
one
person
one
vote
to
ensure
equal
civil
rights
for
white
and
black
americans
but
the
electoral
college
undermines
this
equality
because
each
individual
vote
does
not
carry
equal
weight
such
a
system
can
be
racially
exploited
hayes
charged
providing
an
example
of
a
majority
black
city
being
governed
by
a
majority
white
city
council
hayes
was
heavily
mocked
in
response
critics
argued
the
electoral
college
is
not
unconstitutional
because
it
is
constitutionally-mandated
further
hayes
was
reminded
that
america
is
a
republic
not
a
democracy
whose
leaders
are
elected
directly
by
the
people
an
intentional
design
mechanism
to
ensure
somewhat
equal
representation
for
each
state
