the

killing
us
i'm
going
to

i
have
a
detailed
plan
on
how
i
would
wipe
out
antifa
fbi

responded
within

forcing
kohfield
to
temporarily
surrender
his
firearms
which
included
an
ar-
handgun
rifle

shotgun
to
authorities
he
was
also
committed

oregon's
red
flag
law
allows
a
judge
to
issue
an
extreme
risk
protection
order
against
individuals
who
law
enforcement
or
family
members
believe
is
potentially
violent
to
themselves
or
others
the
protective
order
lasts
one
year
but
can
be
renewed
indefinitely
phil
lemman
oregon's

have
approved
protective

since
the
law
took
effect
last
year
what
did
kohfield
say
the
ex-marine
who
served
two
tours
of
duty
in
iraq
told
the
oregonian
he
understood
why
law
enforcement
targeted
him
i
looked
unhinged
i
looked
dangerous
and
have
the
training
to
be
dangerous
he
said
i
figured
that
the
key
to
de-escalating
the
situation
was
to
not
be
the
most
violent
person
in
the
room
he
explained
it
was
to
be
the
scariest
person
in
the
room
as
far
as
protests
go
kohfield
said
his
days
of
demonstrations
are
over
