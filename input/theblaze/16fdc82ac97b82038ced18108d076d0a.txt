and
ilhan
omar

planned
to
visit
israel
and
palestinian
territories
this
weekend
but
the
israeli
government
has
blocked
them
from
entering
the
country
because
they
support
the
anti-israel
boycott
movement
the
washington

reported
tlaib
who
has
family
in
the
west
bank
and
omar
were
planning
to
visit
israel
on
a

by
miftah
a
nonprofit
organization
with
the
goal
of
establishing
a
sovereign
independent
democratic
tolerant
and
inclusive
palestinian
state
at
issue
is
an
israeli
law
that
denies
entry
visas
to
foreigners
who
support
any
form
of
boycott
against
israel
and
its
settlements
in
the
west
bank
the
decision
to
block
the
congresswomen
marks
a
sudden
change
from
comments
made
last
month
by
israeli
ambassador
ron
dermer
who
said
all
u.s.
lawmakers
would
be
allowed
in
the
country
out
of
respect
for
the
u.s.
congress
and
the
great
alliance
between
israel
and
america
congressional
democrats
were
aware
of
the
situation
and
privately
pressed
israeli
officials
to
allow
the
trip
to
go
forward
that
effort
was
reportedly
being
led
by
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
d-md
a
pro-israel
democrat
who
has
a
close
and
longstanding
relationship
with
the
country
tlaib
and
omar
planned
to
visit
jerusalem
bethlehem
hebron
and
ramallah
during
the
private
trip
which
does
not
include
any
scheduled
official
meetings
last
weekend
president
donald
trump
reportedly
told
advisers
that
he
believes
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
should
block
the
visit
white
house
press
secretary
stephanie
grisham
called
that
report
fake
news
saying
the
israeli
government
can
do
what
they
want
however
trump
made
his
view
on
the
situation
clear
in
a
thursday
morning
tweet
it
would
show
great
weakness
if
israel
allowed
rep
omar
and
rep
tlaib
to
visit
they
hate
israel
all
jewish
people
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
said
or
done
to
change
their
minds
president
trump
wrote
minnesota
and
michigan
will
have
a
hard
time
putting
them
back
in
office
they
are
a
disgrace
the
house
of
representatives
overwhelmingly
passed
a
resolution
in
july
condemning
the
boycott
divestment
and
sanctions
movement
that
tlaib
and
omar
both
support
omar
in
particular
has
been
criticized
for
anti-semitic
statements
dating
back
to
a
tweet
in
which
she
wrote
israel
has
hypnotized
the
world
may
allah
awaken
the
people
and
help
them
see
the
evil
doings
of
israel
