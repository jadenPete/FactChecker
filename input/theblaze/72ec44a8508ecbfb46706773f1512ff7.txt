a
mound
of
dead
bodies
isn
t
enough
to
save
beto
s
campaign
robert
francis
beto
o'rourke
the
unaccomplished
vicar
of
bray
of
novice
politicians
who
is
bankrupt
of
original
ideas
and
has
no
clear
vision
for
the
country
now
finds
himself
proselytizing
on
the
backs
of
future
dead
infants
and
the
victims
of
the
el
paso
shooting
because
he
lacks
an
authentic
political
identity
one
example
of
this
came
on
monday
at
the
college
of
charleston's
bully
pulpit
lecture
an
exchange
from
a
question
and
answer
session
only
added
to
beto
o'rourke's
identity
crisis
as
a
presidential
candidate
in
a
predictable
exchange
with
an
attendee
o'rourke
took
legalized
abortion
to
its
furthest
extreme
my
question
is
this
the
man
asked
o'rourke
i
was
born
sept
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
on
sept
my
life
had
no
value
o'rourke
who
is
a
father
of
three
children
offered
a
very
confusing
and
contradictory
response
of
course
i
don't
think
that
replied
o'rourke
and
of
course
i'm
glad
that
you're
here
but
you
referenced
my
answer
in
ohio
and
it
remains
the
same
this
is
a
decision
that
neither
you
nor
i
nor
the
united
states
government
should
be
making
that's
a
decision
for
the
woman
to
make
his
reply
was
met
with
disappointing
cheers
from
the
crowd
what
o'rourke
essentially
endorsed
was
limitless
abortions
or
whatever
he
thought
he
needed
to
endorse
now
to
stay
relevant
in
the
presidential
race
and
even
though
he
agreed
that
the
young
man's
life
had
value
hours
before
birth
and
that
he's
glad
he's
here
o'rourke
affirmed
that
the
choice
of
whether
to
terminate
life
in
the
womb
up
to
birth
remained
the
mother's
decision
and
offered
no
exceptions
to
this
the
habit
of
backing
extreme
positions
for
political
gain
is
a
pattern
of
o'rourke's
on
the
issue
of
gun
rights
a
few
months
ago
he
told
voters
if
you
own
an
ar-
keep
it
so
long
as
they
used
it
responsibly
and
safely
as
if
law-abiding
gun
owners
weren't
already
doing
that
if
that
phrase
sounded
all
too
familiar
that's
because
it
is
if
you
like
your
doctor
you
can
keep
your
doctor
is
what
former
president
barack
obama
said
when
he
was
trying
to
sell
his
signature
health
care
legislation
the
affordable
care
act
after
a
white
nationalist
opened
fire
on
unsuspecting
shoppers
at
a
walmart
earlier
this
month
leaving
dead
in
the
hometown
we
share
o'rourke
took
no
time
in
using
the
tragedy
to
elevate
his
campaign
as
el
paso
became
the
focus
of
media
interest
o'rourke
unscrupulously
used
the
opportunity
to
condemn
the
president
for
the
shooting
in
the
strongest
terms
possible
instead
of
using
it
to
unite
mourners
and
the
country
he
called
president
trump
a
racist
which
only
increased
tensions
and
disagreements
broke
out
at
the
memorial
behind
the
walmart
where
the
shooting
happened
he
also
very
publicly
disinvited
president
trump
to
el
paso
which
only
further
polarized
residents
of
el
paso
and
the
nation
and
then
came
the
cable
news
rounds
where
he
faulted
trump
for
the
murders
called
the
president
a
white
supremacist
and
endorsed
radical
gun
control
legislation
two
weeks
later
he's
been
calling
mexican
immigrants
rapists
and
criminals
members
of
the
press
what
the
f
o'rourke
said
we
all
know
the
president
was
talking
about
ms-
gang
members
and
not
all
immigrants
o'rourke
was
only
looking
to
stoke
outrage
during
a
hyper-emotional
time
his
current
stance
on
guns
calls
for
mandatory
gun
buybacks
for
assault
weapons
and
said
that
anyone
who
failed
to
comply
with
this
will
be
fined
he
also
called
for
gun
licensing
to
quote
his
vanity
fair
cover
being
just
born
to
be
in
it
isn't
enough
in
a
clamorous
field
of
democrats
all
vying
for
the
white
house
o'rourke's
willingness
to
readily
pivot
on
the
issue
of
the
border
gun
rights
and
abortion
in
hopes
that
he'll
clinch
the
nomination
and
defeat
president
trump
are
coming
off
as
insincere
and
self-serving
it's
surprising
that
o'rourke
who
lacks
specifics
on
key
policy
issues
and
didn't
accomplish
much
while
representing
texas
th
congressional
district
in
el
paso
has
made
it
this
far
on
securing
the
border
o'rourke
is
calling
for
the
demilitarization
of
immigration
enforcement
no
border
wall
and
the
removal
of
el
paso's
decade-old
mile
fence
that
protects
the
city
from
violent
crime
and
drug
smugglers
from
one
of
the
most
dangerous
cities
in
the
region
ciudad
juarez
on
gun
rights
following
the
pulse
nightclub
shooting
in
florida
in
o'rourke
participated
in
a
sit-in
with
other
democrats
on
the
house
floor
to
call
for
stricter
gun
laws
that
included
universal
background
checks
magazine
size
limits
and
restrictions
on
some
semiautomatic
weapons
at
the
time
of
the
sit-in
o'rourke
also
opposed
concealed
carry
reciprocity
which
was
backed
by
the
national
rifle
association
and
would
have
permitted
concealed
carry
permits
authorized
in
a
single
state
to
be
valid
nationwide
as
mentioned
above
his
stance
on
this
has
since
radically
changed
his
health
care
plans
remain
murky
too
during
his
time
in
the
house
in
he
backed
universal
health
care
but
wasn't
clear
on
what
path
would
lead
there
then
he
backed
medicare
for
all
but
support
for
that
also
dwindled
until
he
finally
settled
on
calling
for
universal
guaranteed
high-quality
health
care
for
all
another
radical
idea
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
well
thought
out
coupled
with
the
fact
that
his
polling
numbers
are
low
even
after
the
relaunch
of
his
presidential
campaign
his
last-ditch
effort
to
become
as
radical
as
he
can
on
the
issues
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
remain
relevant
is
well
pathetic
he's
fallen
short
of
fundraising
goals
for
august
and
publications
typically
sympathetic
to
progressives
like
politico
new
york
magazine
and
the
new
york
times
are
running
columns
questioning
whether
the
end
is
near
for
the
fickle
ex-congressman
beto's
lack
of
big
ideas
isn't
a
new
revelation
however
his
latest
radical
positions
are
being
that
we're
both
from
el
paso
i
understand
why
his
allure
attracted
the
momentum
it
did
in
texas
he's
homegrown
he's
relatable
he's
fluent
in
another
language
he's
likable
to
some
and
he
isn't
the
archetypal
d.c.
politician
he
has
a
youthfulness
to
him
but
that
isn't
enough
not
on
the
national
scale
and
not
when
you're
in
a
crowded
field
of
democrats
who
are
much
more
polished
and
experienced
than
a
one-term
representative
with
hardly
anything
to
show
and
no
clear
plans
for
america
perhaps
this
is
why
o'rourke
to
fill
the
hollowed-out
parts
of
the
corpse
of
his
campaign
has
latched
onto
gun
control
and
abortion
or
any
issue
he
can
take
the
most
radical
stance
as
his
poll
numbers
continue
to
whimper
o'rourke's
attempt
to
usher
in
a
new
era
of
his
campaign
by
chastening
the
victims
of
a
tragedy
and
future
victims
of
abortion
is
the
same
reason
why
americans
have
largely
rejected
his
janus-faced
candidacy
