nascar
declines
gun
ads
citing
gradual
shift
on
their
stance
ak-
s
ar-
s
and
scoped
rifles
have
all
been
featured
in
the
past
nascar
has
reportedly
changed
its
policy
on
allowing
certain
gun
advertising
due
to
a
gradual
shift
in
its
position
according
to
the
organization's
web
sales
agency
what
are
the
details
shooting

supplier
k-var
wrote
on
its
blog
last
week
in
march
and
april
several
firearms
retailers
and
manufacturers
were
contacted
by
national
event
publications

today
lifestyle
the
pitch
was
to
buy
advertising
in
the
official
program
for
the
last
races
of
the
season
k-var
opted
to
advertise
as
did
at
least
other
manufacturers
or
retailers
including
cz-usa
beretta
daniel
defense
and
others
the
deadline
to
have
our
artwork
submitted
for
approval
was
april
then
on
august
four
months
later
we
were
contacted
by
national
event
publications
with
the
following
message
we
just
heard
from
nascar
on
a
number
of
gun
related
ads
and
unfortunately
due
a
gradual
shift
in
nascar's
position
on
guns
these
ads
must
be
edited
changed
especially
those
that
are
depicted
as
assault-style
rifles
sniper
rifles
nascar
is
still
open
to
some
of
the
less
controversial
gun
accessories
concealed
carry
or
classes
k-var
noted
that
ak-
s
ar-
s
and
scoped
rifles
have
all
been
featured
in
the
past
pro-second
amendment
site
bearing
arms
reported
on
k-var's
blog
post
and
cautioned
against
a
nascar
boycott
but
pointed
out
historically
nascar
has
come
across
pretty
pro-gun
there
are
races
co-sponsored
by
companies
like
bass
pro
shops
and
the
nra
there's
the
truck
series
sponsored
by
gander
outdoor
and
gun
companies
have
been
able
to
advertise
with
the
sport
for
several
years
prior
to
this
so
what's
going
on
manufacturer
and
retailer
of
firearms
ammunition
parts
and
accessories
dark
storm
industries
was
also
hit
by
the
nascar
shift
on
its
instagram
account
the
company
told
its
story
saying
nascar
decided
to
turn
their
back
on
their
customer
base
joining
the
likes
of
yeti
dick's
and
under
armour
we
were
approached
by
a
nascar
publication
eager
to
earn
our
business
but
after
submitting
our
ad
it
was
immediately
rejected
stating
that
we
cannot
depict
assault
weapons
whatever
those
are
we
resubmitted
the
ad
after
adding
a
large
censored
bar
over
the
rifle
with
a
tag
reading
this
publication
rejected
our
ad
this
too
was
rejected
by
nascar
they
said
they
did
not
like
that
we
called
them
out
we
resubmitted
a
third
time
with
a
tag
line
reading

to
find
out
why
this
was
again
rejected
they
did
not
like
the
words
find
out
why
as
we
have
learned
nascar
has
made
a
gradual
shift
but
this
doesn't
seem
very
gradual
to
us
it
seems
as
though
nascar
has
turned
their
back
on
the
overwhelming
majority
of
their
fan
base
in
the
most
embarrassing
way
possible
