in
punitive
damages
with
his
suit
torres
alleges
that
he
was
fired
in
for
refusing
to

torres
suit
notes
that
he
asked

a
religious
exemption
in
to
avoid

reportedly
denied
the
exemption
so
torres
said

claimed
that
his
sergeant
alternately
granted
and
denied
the
requests
and
ended
up
firing
him
two
months
later
in
the
filing
torres
said
that
training
female
deputies
on
a
one-on-one
basis
could
give
the
appearance
of
sinful
conduct
on
his
part
a
portion
of
the
lawsuit
reads
torres
holds
the
strong
and
sincere
religious
belief
that
the
holy
bible
prohibits
him
as
a
married
man
from
being
alone
for
extended
periods
with
a
female
who
is
not

job
offer
after
hearing
about
torres
termination
and
that
the
apex
police
department
ignored
torres
requests
for
employment
opportunities
torres
suit
insists
that
the
lee
county
sheriff's
office
gave
negative
referrals
to
area
police
departments
so
as
to
jeopardize
his
future
employment
according
to
the
charlotte

a
federal
court
will
decide
if
the
case
amounts
to
discrimination
