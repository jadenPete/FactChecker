maxwell
is
an
entertainment
lawyer
and
a
music
business
veteran
but
he's
also
a
committed
christian
with
a
unique
and
refreshing
perspective
on
integrity
and
success
maxwell
was
once
a
record
label
executive
but
he
doesn't
approach
life
in
the
stereotypical
way
some
might
expect
from
an
attorney
and
music
industry
pro
rather
than
putting
business
money
and
materialism
first
he
follows
a
totally
different
blueprint
maxwell
author
of
the
book
networking
kills
success
through

believes
that
too
many
of
us
are
getting
the
quest
and

what
does
the
bible
teach
jesus
taught
that
if
you
want
to
be
great
if
you
want
to
be
a
leader
if
you
want
to
be
successful
it's
about
laying

podcast
today
he
added
that
culture
encourages
people
to
go
out
and
take
and
use
others
but
that
christ
teaches
humans
to
go
out
and
give
those
two
worldviews
are
really
at
odds
he
added
read
also
companies
that
have
hidden
bible
verses
on
their
products
one
area
where
maxwell
sees
society
going
wrong
on
the
success
front
is
in
the
massive
push
for
young
people
to
engage
in
rampant
networking
with
the
how
can
you
serve
me
attitude
that
often
comes
with
hobnobbing
he
said
the
process
can
encourage
young
people
to
be
too
focused
on
exploiting
people
instead
of
giving
and
serving
people
maxwell
became
passionate
about
teaching
young
people
that
there's
more
to
advancement
than
networking
and
that
there's
a
bigger
calling
for
people
to
follow
in
his
own
law
practice
he
began
to
serve
others
be
generous
and
give
away
free
legal
time
as
much
as
possible

here's
christian
movies
that
will
renew
your
faith
god
really
began
to
show
me
that
success
and
fruitfulness
in
my
law
practice
has
to
start
with
the
care
and
service
of
others
maxwell
said
as
i
care
and
serve
others
as
opposed
to
promoting
myself
that's
the
best
marketing
i
can
do
