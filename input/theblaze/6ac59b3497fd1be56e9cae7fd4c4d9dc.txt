joe
walsh
addresses
past
racist
comments
then
claims
everyone
has
a
little
bit
of
racism
in
us
there's
no
doubt
about
it
joe
walsh
the
former
republican
congressman
who
recently
launched
a
presidential
campaign
to
challenge
president
donald
trump
claimed
monday
that
he
is
not
racist
despite
making
racist
comments
in
the
past
msnbc's
john
heilemann
confronted
walsh
about
his
inflammatory
past
during
an
interview
monday
specifically
citing
when
walsh
used
the
n-word
multiples
times
on
social
media
and
when
he
falsely
declared
president
barack
obama
a
muslim
i
wouldn't
call
myself
a
racist
but
i
would
say
john
i've
said
racist
things
on
twitter
there's
no
doubt
about
it
and
apology
is
not
enough
walsh
said
walsh
then
attempted
to
offer
heilemann
who
called
walsh
a
racist
some
context
i've
probably
sent
out
tweets
in
the
last
six
years
no
excuse
you
and
i
could
sit
down
and
find
to
that
you'd
say
walsh
what
were
you
thinking
and
all
i
can
do
is
own
them
and
explain
them
and
apologize
as
sincerely
as
i
can
for
those
that
deserve
an
apology
walsh
explained
walsh
also
address
his
previous
use
of
the
n-word
explaining
he
did
it
in
response
to
the
movement
to
change
the
washington
redskins
team
name
by
activists
who
claimed
redskins
is
a
new
n-word
the
n-word
has
a
unique
ugly
history
in
this
country
walsh
told
heilemann
to
make
that
point
i
wrote
down
the
n-word
in
a
tweet
to
make
a
point
that
that's
not
nearly
what
the
word
redskins
is
later
when
asked
by
a
washington
post
reporter
how
he
can
say
racist
things
without
being
racist
walsh
claimed
that
all
people
are
a
little
bit
racist
i
think
that
we
all
if
we're
honest
white
black
and
brown
we've
all
got
a
little
bit
of
racism
in
us
walsh
claimed
there's
no
doubt
that
there
are
times
where
i've
pushed
the
envelope
and
when
i've
said
things
that
could
certainly
be
interpreted
as
racist
walsh
also
revealed
on
monday
that
he
has
lost
his
nationally
syndicated
radio
show
since
announcing
his
presidential
candidacy
