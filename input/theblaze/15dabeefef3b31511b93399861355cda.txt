another
one
bites
the
dust
john
hickenlooper
formally
ends
presidential
bid
he
says
he'll
give
serious
thought
to
running
for
senate
struggling
candidate
john
hickenlooper
formally
ended
his
bid
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
with
a
video
announcement
on
social
media
thursday
in
almost
every
regard
this
journey
has
been
more
exciting
and
more
rewarding
than
i
ever
imagined
the
former
former
colorado
governor
said
of
course
i
did
imagine
a
very
different
conclusion
i
ran
for
president
because
this
country
is
being
ripped
apart
by
politics
and
partisan
games
while
our
biggest
problems
go
unsolved
hickenlooper
who
campaigned
as
a
moderate
continued
now
today
i'm
ending
my
campaign
for
president
but
i
will
never
stop
believing
that
america
can
only
move
forward
when
we
work
together
the
announcement
comes
a
day
after
a
source
close
to
the
campaign
told
axios
that
the
former
geologist
and
colorado
governor
planned
to
close
up
shop
on
his
presidential
aims
as
of
monday
hickenlooper's
campaign
was
still
short
of
the
individual
donor
and
qualifying
poll
minimums
necessary
to
get
a
spot
on
the
third
democratic
debate
stage
a
hill-harrisx
poll
released
on
wednesday
showed
the
candidate
at
percent
the
former
governor
also
said
that
while
he
would
no
longer
campaign
for
the
white
house
he
would
also
entertain
calls
for
him
to
run
for
senate
against
incumbent
republican
sen
cory
gardner
in
his
home
state
in
the
upcoming
election
cycle
i've
heard
from
so
many
coloradans
who
want
me
to
run
for
the
united
states
senate
they
remind
me
how
much
is
at
stake
for
our
country
and
our
state
hickenlooper
said
toward
the
end
of
the
video
announcement
i
intend
to
give
that
some
serious
thought
hickenlooper
is
the
latest
democratic
presidential
hopeful
to
drop
out
of
the
primary
since
california
rep
eric
swalwell
ended
his
campaign
early
last
month
before
that
former
west
virginia
state
sen
richard
ojeda
ended
his
longshot
democratic
primary
bid
in
late
january
