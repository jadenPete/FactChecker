alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
says
that
climate
change
frightens
her
so
much
she
wakes
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thinking
about
it
even
while
on
vacation
what
are
the
details
of
this
harrowing
event
on
tuesday
night
the
freshman
congresswoman
went
on
facebook
live
to
answer
constituents
and
supporters
questions
one
person
pointed
out
that
they
were
very
concerned
by
the
notion
of
climate
change
and
the
newly
minted
lawmaker
agreed
in
a
portion
of
the
video
as
highlighted
by
the
daily
wire's
ryan
saavedra
ocasio-cortez
related
to
the
question
and
admitted
that
she
is
greatly
bothered
by
the
idea
too
in
the
video
the
social
media
user
shared
their
concerns
and
wrote
how
can
we
save
the
climate
im
sic
trying
to
have
a
nice
life
even
when
i
was
on
vacation
i
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
in
the
morning
um
just
concerned
about
climate
change
ocasio-cortez
responded
i'm
years
old
i
really
struggle
sometimes
with
the
idea
of
how
to
be
a
policymaker
and
potentially
have
a
family
in
the
time
of
climate
change
it
really
like
freaks
me
out
and
it
can
be
really
really
scary
she
admitted
is
there
more
there
certainly
is
elsewhere
during
the
facebook
live
appearance
ocasio-cortez
warned
of
melting
glaciers
which
could
spread
diseases
there
are
a
lot
of
diseases
that
are
frozen
in
some
of
these
glaciers
that
scientists
fear
that
there
is
a
potential
that
a
lot
of
diseases
could
escape
these
melted
glaciers
things
that
were
frozen
for
thousands
of
years
that
they
could
get
into
our
water
and
that
humans
could
contract
them
she
warned
they
are
going
to
be
diseases
that
are
thousands
of
years
old
that
have
vectors
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
that
we
have
never
seen
and
so
that's
a
concern
the
new
york
congresswoman
later
added
that
the
only
way
to
combat
the
effects
of
climate
change
is
to
exercise
your
right
to
vote
and
reduce
your
own
carbon
footprint
t
he
best
thing
we
can
do
is
be
as
supportive
of
climate
policy
and
to
prioritize
it
like
if
you
can
make
climate
change
one
of
your
top
three
voting
issues
that's
a
huge
thing
you
can
do
but
also
if
you
change
your
personal
consumption
that
can
do
a
lot
as
well
she
insisted
