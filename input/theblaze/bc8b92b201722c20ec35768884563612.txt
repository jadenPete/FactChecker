the
latest
entry
for
what
if
obama
had
said
what
trump
just
said
ordering
us
businesses
to
seek
alternatives
to
china
we're
in
crazyland
now
here
at
theblaze
we
tend
not
to
cover
the
nutty
things
said
in
president
donald
trump's
twitter
feed
or
his
impromptu
press
conferences
or
his
maga
rallies
and
for
obvious
reasons
we
don't
have
the
hours
energy
or
staff
to
really
do
it
justice
plus
it
wouldn't
really
be
a
great
use
of
our
time
or
yours
frankly
there's
a
good
argument
to
be
made
that
the
president
should
be
judged
by
what
his
administration
does
not
what
the
president
says
on
twitter
after
all
however
today
we
see
that
perhaps
there
are
times
that
the
craziness
of
the
things
our
president
simply
declares
must
be
pointed
out
and
the
people
who
offer
knee-jerk
defense
of
his
nonsense
made
to
feel
uncomfortable
quite
a
week
forget
the
greenland
silliness
and
pissing
match
with
denmark
forget
his
tweeting
of
wayne
allen
root's
claim
that
jews
in
israel
love
the
president
like
he's
the
king
of
israel
forget
the
fact
that
he
called
himself
the
chosen
one
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
our
chinese
trade
deficit
interestingly
he
didn't
point
out
that
despite
the
stated
goal
of
his
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
the
trade
deficit
remains
in
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
forget
even
his
question
of
whether
fed
chairman
jay
powell
whom
the
president
nominated
or
chinese
strongman
xi
is
a
bigger
threat
to
the
u.s.
and
that's
just
from
this
week
today
however
you
should
note
that
our
president
assumed
that
he
could
simply
use
the
power
of
his
office
to
order
u.s.
businesses
to
seek
non-chinese
places
to
do
business
the
vast
amounts
of
money
made
and
stolen
by
china
from
the
united
states
year
after
year
for
decades
will
and
must
stop
trump
tweeted
in
response
to
china's
retaliatory
tariffs
on
u.s.
goods
our
great
american
companies
are
hereby
ordered
to
immediately
start
looking
for
an
alternative
to
china
including
bringing
your
companies
home
and
making
your
products
in
the
usa
i
wonder
who
on
the
white
house
staff
drew
the
short
straw
and
had
to
break
the
news
to
him
please
to
be
noting
his
command
for
u.s.
businesses
followed
his
declaration
that
we
don't
need
china
and
frankly
would
be
far
better
off
without
them
fun
fact
china
holds
trillion
of
u.s.
debt
second
only
to
japan
which
holds
trillion
we
kinda
do
need
them
unfortunately
and
keep
in
mind
these
tweets
are
not
a
declaration
of
sanctions
on
beijing
which
would
destroy
our
economy
but
an
attempt
to
intimidate
american
manufacturers
few
people
question
whether
the
president
can
order
sanctions
on
a
country
particularly
a
country
that
supports
terrorism
a
la
the
sanctions
on
iran
this
is
not
that
the
imposition
of
sanctions
requires
a
formal
process
that
involves
the
administration
making
statutorily
defined
findings
findings
which
can
be
challenged
in
court
for
instance
if
the
united
states
declared
australia
a
state
sponsor
of
terror
and
imposed
sanctions
on
companies
that
dealt
with
australia
those
companies
would
be
allowed
to
challenge
such
a
finding
in
court
per
federal
law
it
requires
a
lot
more
than
just
a
president
unilaterally
deciding
that
he
wants
to
punish
a
country
for
not
acting
as
he
would
prefer
during
a
tariff
war
what
if
obama
said
it
we
in
serious
crazyland
now
things
like
this
must
be
pointed
out
and
shamed
there
was
a
day
a
loooooong
time
ago
like
maybe
three
years
when
conservatives
and
republicans
would
have
gone
into
conniptions
if
such
an
outlandish
power-grabbing
statement
had
come
from
barack
obama
and
if
hillary
clinton
had
said
it
during
the
campaign
trump
and
his
acolytes
would
have
rightfully
campaigned
on
it
and
bludgeoned
her
with
the
audaciousness
of
the
comment
oh
the
good
ol
days
of
the
mid-
s
when
conservatives
were
principled
and
gopers
were
willing
to
keep
standing
for
the
things
they
apparently
didn't
actually
believe
in
good
times
