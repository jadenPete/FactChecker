at
another
nuclear
site
russia
launches
a
floating
nuclear
power
plant
the
akademik
lomonosov
will
supply
power
to
different
sites
along
russia's
icy
northern
coast
russia
has
launched
a
floating
nuclear
reactor
this
comes
only
weeks
after
a
meltdown
at
one
of
its
nuclear
test
sites
here's
what
we
know
the
akademik
lomonosov
vessel
launched
friday
from
the
arctic
sea
port
of
murkansk
in
western
russia
from
there
it
will
sail
along
russia's
northern
coast
until
it
reaches
pevek
in
the
east
this
roughly
mile
route
is
not
heavily
populated
according
to
agence
france-presse
this
reactor
will
replace
a
nuclear
power
plant
already
in
pevek
it
will
also
bring
power
to
the
chaun-bilibin
mining
complex
and
offshore
oil
rigs
russia's
nuclear
agency
rosatom
said
that
the
barge
would
be
used
to
supply
power
to
these
remote
regions
according
to
the
russian
news
program
vesti
the
reactors
on
board
are
powerful
enough
to
provide
light
and
heat
for
people
the
bbc
reported
that
one
of
the
akademik
lomonosov's
planned
uses
is
to
deliver
power
to
russian
oil
rigs
rosatom
hopes
that
it
can
use
more
barges
in
the
future
to
become
the
first
company
to
commercially
supply
floating
nuclear
power
according
to
bloomberg
news
this
is
rosatom's
first
floating
nuclear
power
reactor
in
addition
to
providing
power
these
floating
power
plants
could
also
be
used
to
turn
sea
water
into
fresh
water
rosatom
is
already
working
on
an
improved
newer
version
of
this
plant
what
else
earlier
this
month
russia
admitted
that
five
atomic
scientists
had
been
killed
in
a
nuclear
accident
at
one
of
its
military
facilities
in
addition
to
the
deaths
the
incident
caused
a
spike
in
radiation
levels
although
the
russian
government
has
been
quiet
about
how
bad
the
disaster
actually
was
