said
harris
announcement
that
he
was
leaving
christianity
behind
left
the
company
with
no
decision
but
to
halt
the
project
unfortunately
josh
did
not
tip
off
his
film
team
partners
of
these
surprising
changes
before
his
public
post
nor
how
this
would
change
our
company's
distribution
efforts
of
the
film
he
had
worked
with
us
on
to
promote
penn
said
wishing
harris
the
best
and
acknowledging
that
the
author
and
former

is
clearly
searching
for
answers

added
that
harris
lack
of
transparency
left
the
company
no
other
choice
we
have
no
other
choice
but
to
halt
promotion
of
the
film
he
said
he
later
told
faithwire
that
harris
public
declaration
left
the
company
in
an
awkward
position
and
hurt
its
distribution
efforts
throughout
the
christian
community
discussions
that
are
christian
in
nature
happen
throughout
the
film
and
the
former
pastor's
public
statements
on
marriage
and
especially
christianity
undermine
key
parts
of
the
film
he
told
the
outlet
it
puts
our
team
in
an
awkward
position
to
promote
the
documentary

explained
that
the
company
received
myriad
complaints
from
customers
ministries
and
pastors
demanding
that
they
remove
harris
products
from
their
shelves
after
the
former
pastor's
remarks
integrity
in
business
penn
told
the
outlet
is
something
that
is
very
important
for
us
anything
else
harris
a
former
sexual
purity
proponent
who
wrote
i
kissed
dating
goodbye
in
also
announced
that
he
recently
split
with
his
wife
of
years
before
his
divorce
harris
distanced
himself
from
the
popular
book
saying
i
no
longer
agree
with
its
central
idea
that
dating
should
be
avoided
i
now
think
dating
can
be
a
healthy
part
of
a
person
developing
relationally
and
learning
the
qualities
that
matter
most
in
a
partner
to
those
who
read
my
book
and
were
misdirected
or
unhelpfully
influenced
by
it
i
am
sincerely
sorry
harris
apologized
harris
attended
a
pride
parade
earlier
