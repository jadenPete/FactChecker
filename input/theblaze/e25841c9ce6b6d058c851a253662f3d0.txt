eric
swalwell
grotesquely
uses
texas
massacre
as
basis
for
snarky
dig
at
good
guys
with
guns
because
of
course
he
did
rep
eric
swalwell
has
a
history
of
comically
bad
takes
and
failed
attempts
at
owning
the
cons
on
twitter
and
he
is
not
one
to
let
something
like
death
and
sorrow
to
get
in
the
way
of
his
untouchable
record
streak
of
fails
as
we
saw
on
sunday
when
he
decided
to
make
a
sarcastic
snarky
no
doubt
in
his
mind
witty
jab
at
the
idea
that
a
private
citizen
in
possession
of
a
firearm
might
be
able
to
use
it
against
someone
committing
a
crime
or
attacking
people
per
his
milieu
it
was
inappropriate
insensitive
ill-conceived
ill-timed
and
just
enough
to
make
anyone
ill
that
is
anyone
who
isn't
similarly
prone
to
childish
and
gross
outbursts
seven
people
were
killed
and
more
injured
in
odessa
texas
on
saturday
when
a
madman
went
on
a
rampage
shooting
randomly
at
victims
across
the
city
after
being
pulled
over
by
police
for
driving
erratically
on
twitter
democrat
politicians
were
in
gun
control
mode
very
quickly
and
in
the
case
of
some
beto
o'rourke
for
example
they
were
also
in
fundraising
mode
raising
funds
off
the
deaths
swalwell
retweeted
an
o'rourke
tweet
and
commented
about
the
need
to
get
rid
of
assault
weapons
and
a
twitter
user
replied
to
him
about
open
carry
we
need
to
support
open
carry
this
will
stop
all
these
mass
shootings
truth
is
light
praiseinhisname
september
that's
when
swalwell
decided
to
open
the
snark
locker
for
some
reason
big
shout
out
to
all
the
civilian
good
guys
with
guns
who
saved
lives
in
odessa
you
know
who
you
are
thanks
a
million
btw
texas
is
an
open
carry
state

eric
swalwell
repswalwell
september
see
what
he
did
there
because
the
shooter
was
stopped
by
law
enforcement
in
a
shootout
he's
sarcastically
offering
thanks
to
civilians
with
guns
you
know
who
you
are
thanks
a
million
get
it
it's
funny
because
they
don't
exist
that's
the
joke
swalwell
made
that's
the
snarky
sarcastic
jab
he
opted
for
in
the
wake
of
human
suffering
because
that's
what
he
really
thinks
you
see
he
mocks
the
idea
that
a
civilian
with
a
gun
could
pull
a
trigger
and
shoot
a
bad
guy
and
the
reason
isn't
because
he
thinks
the
bad
guys
are
very
dangerous
he
is
saying
that
people
who
own
guns
are
all
bad
guys
it's
not
just
a
joke
that
there
weren't
any
civilians
specifically
intervening
on
saturday
no
his
premise
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
guy
with
a
gun
because
good
guys
don't
have
guns
that's
what
he
thinks
and
what
he
said
in
his
best
angry
lib
on
twitter
on
voice
swalwell
is
essentially
an
internet
troll
who
somehow
got
elected
to
office
if
he
weren't
a
member
of
congress
he'd
be
that
guy
you
blocked
two
years
ago
for
haranguing
you
incessantly
in
the
wake
of
violence
in
america
there
is
never
any
shortage
of
bad
behavior
or
bad
decisions
on
social
media
but
the
king
will
never
be
deposed
because
this
is
how
far
he's
willing
to
go
and
because
this
is
what
he
actually
thinks
and
he's
in
congress
but
nobody
is
talking
about
taking
guns
away
they'll
keep
saying
as
they
try
to
do
that
very
thing
because
they
believe
in
disarming
bad
guys
and
by
bad
guys
they
mean
you
