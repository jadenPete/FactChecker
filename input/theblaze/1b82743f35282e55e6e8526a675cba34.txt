has
been
facing
an
uphill
battle
when
it
comes
to
knife
attacks
statistics
show
knife
crimes
involving
murders
and
robberies
have
risen
for
five
straight
years
in
england
and
wales
fox
news
reported
authorities
recorded
knife
crime
offenses
between
april
and
march
an
percent
increase
from
the
same
period
five
years
earlier
when
only
offenses
were
recorded
the
cable
network
added
officials
have
tried
a
number
of
tactics
to
stem
the
tide
of
knife
attacks
replacing
knives
with
blunt-tipped
cutlery
in
the
kitchens
of
domestic
abuse
victims
collecting
knives
through
surrender
boxes
one
of
which
was
broken
into
and
cleaned
out
a
member
of
parliament
even
suggested
placing
gps
trackers
in
the
handles
of
every
knife
sold

much
mockery
ensued

over
chicken
boxes
with
the
government's
knifefree
campaign
have
been
distributed
to
over
outlets
in
england
and
wales
according
to
pa
media
which
added
that
the
insides
of
the
boxes
include
young
people's
real
life
stories
about
choosing
to
pursue
positive
activities
instead
of
carrying
knives
these
chicken
boxes
will
bring
home
to
thousands
of
young
people
the
tragic
consequences
of
carrying
a
knife
and
challenge
the
idea
that
it
makes
you

the
mockery
seemed
worse

said
the

member

david
lammy
tweeted
he
added
to
the
guardian
that
the
home
office
is
pushing
the
stereotype
that
black
people
love
fried
chicken
this
ridiculous
stunt
is
either
explicitly
racist
or
at
best
unfathomably
stupid
shadow

secretary

tweeted
instead
of
investing
in
a
public
health
approach
to
violent
crime
the
home
office
have
opted
for
yet
another
crude
offensive
and
probably
expensive
campaign
they
would
do
better
to
invest
in
our
communities
not
demonize
them
the
guardian
said
others
on
twitter
offered
more
cutting
reactions
when
a
civilization
dies
remember
when
you
guys
ruled
the

now
look
at

at

you've
become
this
is
the
stupidest
s

i've
ever
seen
honest
to
god
if
the
best
idea
you
have
to
tackle
knife
crime
is
to
write
stuff
on
fried
chicken
you
should
quit
power
forever
in
embarrassment
not
tweet
it
