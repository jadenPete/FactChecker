i
can't

of
way

combat
these
storms
yet
the
man
told

florida
his
suggestion
use

military
to
fight
hurricanes

keep
saying
it's
going

hit
all
this
warm
weather

we
have
a
navy
he
said
why
don't
the
navy
come
and
drop
ice
in
the
warm
water
so
it
don't
so
it
can't
get
going
as
fast
as
it's
going
there's
gotta
be
ways

the
thing

going
well

getting
worse

getting
worse
the
man

the
warm
weather
oh
it's
the
wind
well
we
have
an
air
force
drive
some
air
force
planes
around
to
get
the
winds
going
the
opposite
way
and
the
navy
