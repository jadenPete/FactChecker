here
is
the
solution
to
raising
kids
who
grow
up
to
lick
blue
bell

cream
in
the
grocery
store

prather
on
saturday
chad
prather
ranted
about
a
popular
and
disgusting
prank
that
involved
opening
an
ice
cream
container
at
the
grocery
store
licking
it
and
then
placing
the
item
back
on
the
shelf
for
an
unsuspecting
consumer
to
purchase
in
this
clip
chad
expressed
his
belief
that
a
human
being
is
obligated
to
keep
their
spit
to
themselves
unless
they
agree
upon
face
suction
with
another
human
being
there
is
a
line
that
you
do
not
cross
and
people
have
been
crossing
it
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
why
chad
demanded
chad
pointed
to
the
parents
who
raised
a
generation
of
kids
with
too
much
time
on
their
hands
which
they
used
to
cause
other
people
misery
i
swear
the
end
is
near
chad
said
the
way
i
figured
the
motivation
goes
something
like
this
chad
began
we
have
become
a
culture
of
gregarious
isolationists
and
that
means
the
hierarchy
of
our
attention
span
has
shifted
in
the
past
decade
and
a
half
that
means
that
we
serve
our
new
and
glorious
master
social
media
chad
offered
his
solution
to
the
problem
of
raising
kids
who
grow
up
to
lick
blue
bell
ice
cream
and
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
as
a
prank
parents

have
to
