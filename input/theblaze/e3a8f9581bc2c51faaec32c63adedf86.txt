the
us
is
not
an
accident

episode
of

chen
discussed
the
ever-changing
demographics
in
the
united

well
as
the
media-created
narrative

into
white
supremacy
in
this
clip

demographics
lauren
played
a
clip
from
tucker
carlson
tonight
to
help
illustrate
her
point
in
the
clip

explained
the
problems
that
happen
within
local
communities

the
values
and
cultural
norms
of
the

become
threatened
by
newly
amnestied
immigrants

explained
that
in
today's
political
climate
conservatives

no
longer
allowed
to
question
anything
related
to
immigration
without
being
called
a
racist

majority
hispanic

they
cannot
communicate
with
the
majority
of
people
within
the
community
