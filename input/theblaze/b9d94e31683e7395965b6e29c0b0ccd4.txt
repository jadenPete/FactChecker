college
football
player
transfers
to
be
near
mom
after
her
brain
tumor
and
the
ncaa
punishes
him
it's
just
wrong
a
college
football
player
who
transferred
to
another
school
to
be
closer
to
his
mother
who
is
recovering
from
a
brain
tumor
has
been
denied
eligibility
to
play
during
the
season
according
to
the
roanoke
times
brock
hoffman
previously
attended
and
played
football
at
coastal
carolina
in
early
his
mother
stephanie
had
surgery
to
have
a
non-cancerous
brain
tumor
removed
after
brock's
sophomore
year
he
decided
to
transfer
to
virginia
tech
which
is
about
half
the
distance
from
his
parents
home
as
coastal
carolina
is
hoffman
sought
a
waiver
of
the
ncaa's
rule
that
players
transferring
to
other
football
bowl
subdivision
schools
must
sit
out
a
year
the
intention
of
the
rule
is
to
prevent
an
excessive
amount
of
transfers
something
the
organization
believes
undermines
its
academic
mission
the
ncaa
does
allow
players
to
submit
waiver
requests
for
exceptions
in
certain
circumstances
hoffman
had
his
initial
waiver
denied
in
april
and
on
tuesday
his
final
appeal
was
also
denied
the
ncaa
said
the
waiver
wasn't
granted
in
part
because
stephanie
was
recovering
however
the
family
says
they
provided
documentation
that
she
has
facial
paralysis
hearing
loss
and
impaired
eyesight
but
the
ncaa
asked
if
things
are
so
bad
why
didn't
she
retire
from
her
job
as
a
teacher
brian
hoffman
brock's
father
and
stephanie's
husband
was
appalled
by
the
line
of
questioning
we
have
almost
a
million
dollars
of
medical
bills
brian
said
she's
a
teacher
and
doesn't
have
enough
years
to
get
full
pay
from
her
pension
we
simply
couldn't
afford
it
further
contributing
to
the
denial
is
a
new
rule
the
ncaa
implemented
over
the
summer
which
stated
that
transfers
due
to
family
illnesses
must
occur
within
or
immediately
after
the
academic
year
brian
said
no
one
ever
mentioned
that
rule
before
tuesday
the
ncaa's
process
is
just
horrible
brian
said
it's
just
wrong
brock
won't
be
able
to
play
in
but
he
and
the
family
are
exploring
potential
legal
action
against
the
ncaa
to
prevent
this
from
happening
to
others
in
the
future
the
family
is
now
looking
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
brock
is
probably
handling
it
better
than
we
are
brian
said
brock
will
redshirt
work
on
his
craft
and
be
ready
to
go
for
he's
got
a
lot
of
good
people
he's
become
friends
with
i'm
so
proud
of
the
way
he's
handled
it
and
dealt
with
it
