trump
hints
at
major
middle
income
tax
cut
with
one
condition
democrats
only
want
to
raise
your
taxes
president
donald
trump
hinted
saturday
that
additional
tax
cuts
are
in
the
future
for
tens
of
millions
of
americans
however
the
president
said
the
major
middle
income
tax
cut
would
only
become
reality
if
republicans
retain
control
of
the
senate
and
retake
control
of
the
house
in
if
republicans
take
back
the
house
and
keep
the
senate
and
presidency
one
of
our
first
acts
will
be
to
approve
a
major
middle
income
tax
cut
trump
said
democrats
only
want
to
raise
your
taxes
trump
did
not
elaborate
on
his
promise
nor
did
the
white
house
release
additional
details
larry
kudlow
the
top
white
house
economic
adviser
said
this
week
that
trump
could
propose
new
tax
cuts
before
the
presidential
election
that
would
additional
economic
relief
for
individuals
and
small
businesses
the
personal
tax
rates
could
easily
be
lowered
and
probably
the
brackets
could
be
shrunk
that's
a
thought
kudlow
said
we
might
even
kind
of
work
through
a
way
to
help
our
friends
in
some
of
the
states
who
are
concerned
about
the
shrinkage
of
the
tax
deductions
there
the
salt
taxes
however
kudlow
cautioned
that
such
proposals
are
not
guaranteed
i'm
just
these
are
for
examples
ok
for
examples
he
said
trump
made
a
similar
promise
in
but
the
cuts
never
came
to
fruition
because
republicans
lost
control
of
the
house
the
one
stipulation
trump
added
to
his
promise
if
trump
follows
through
this
time
it
would
be
the
second
major
tax
cut
of
his
presidency
the
first
came
in
and
provided
tax
relief
for
the
majority
of
americans
