rashida
tlaib
threatens
boycott
against
bill
maher
over
israel
and
he
just
hit
her
with
the
perfect
reply
some
people
have
one
move
only
rep
rashida
tlaib
d-mich
called
for
a
boycott
against
liberal
entertainer
bill
maher
over
his
comments
against
her
anti-israel
advocacy
and
he
hit
back
with
the
perfect
response
maybe
folks
should
boycott
his
show
she
said
in
a
tweet
maher
had
excoriated
tlaib
and
others
for
their
lack
of
understanding
of
the
history
of
israel
and
the
use
of
the
bds
movement
as
a
purity
test
for
liberals
it's
a
bulls
t
purity
test
bds
is
a
bulls
t
purity
test
by
people
who
want
to
appear
woke
but
actually
slept
through
history
class
maher
said
friday
it's
predicated
on
this
notion
i
think
it's
very
shallow
thinking
that
the
jews
in
israel
are
mostly
white
and
palestinians
are
mostly
brown
so
they
must
be
innocent
and
correct
and
the
jews
must
be
wrong
he
added
as
if
the
occupation
came
right
out
of
the
blue
that
this
completely
peaceful
people
found
themselves
occupied
maher
concluded
forget
about
the
intifadas
and
the
suicide
bombings
and
the
rockets
and
how
many
wars
tlaib
criticized
him
in
the
acidic
tweet
calling
for
a
boycott
i
am
tired
of
folks
discrediting
a
form
of
speech
that
is
centered
on
equality
and
freedom
she
said
this
is
exactly
how
they
tried
to
discredit
stop
the
boycott
to
stand
up
against
the
apartheid
in
s.
africa
it
didn't
work
then
and
it
won't
now
maher
had
a
simple
response
some
people
have
one
move
only
boycott
cancel
he
mocked
make-go-away
but
here's
the
thing
the
house
voted
to
to
condemn
the
bds
movement
including
of
dems
he
said
does
tlaib
want
to
boycott
of
her
own
party
maher
later
added
that
he
had
under-reported
the
number
of
votes
against
the
bds
movement
which
was
higher
