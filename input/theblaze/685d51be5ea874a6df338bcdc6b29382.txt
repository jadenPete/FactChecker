an
interview
with
the

i-vt
praised
china's
communist
leadership
by
crediting
them
with
making
more
progress
in
addressing
extreme

the

communist
party
of
china
in
indeed
nearly
million

bernie
sanders
one
of
the
leading
presidential
candidates
yesterday
tried
to
praise
communist
china
which
is
in
and
of
itself
an
interesting
thing
to
do
but
he
ended
up
praising
capitalism
glenn
beck
said
on
wednesday's
radio
program
glenn
played
a
clip
from
sanders
interview
in
which
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
can
be
heard
saying
i
n
fairness
to
china
and
its
leadership
is
if
i'm
not
mistaken
they
have
made
more
progress
in
addressing
extreme
poverty
than
any
country
in
the
history
of
civilization
what
he
didn't
talk
about
was
the
free-market
principle
that
china
started
to
enact
that
they
got
from
us
it
wasn't
communism
glenn
said
what
happened
over
the
last
few
decades
can
be
summed
up
in
a
few
sentences
he
continued
china
embraced
the
tenets
of
a
free
market
economic
system
it
introduced
private
ownership
and
gradually
reduced
the
influence
of
the
once
all-powerful
state
over
the
chinese
economy
now
they're
still
communists
and
it's
still
state-controlled
much
of
it
but
you
also
have
these
independent
companies
these
companies
that
are
not
collapsing
the
companies
that
are
run
by
the
state
are
collapsing
