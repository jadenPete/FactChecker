beto
o'rourke
reaffirms
dark
gun
control
plan
and
says
it
won't
be
voluntary
let's
be
really
clear
with
our
fellow
americans
democratic
presidential
contender
beto
o'rourke
reaffirmed
his
vision
for
gun
control
sunday
in
the
wake
of
another
shooting
tragedy
in
texas
that
left
seven
people
murdered
and
nearly
two
dozen
others
injured
what
we've
been
saying
the
rhetoric
we've
been
using
the
policies
and
practices
and
politics
of
this
country
has
not
been
as
urgent
enough
as
needed
doesn't
meet
this
crisis
o'rourke
said
on
msnbc
so
let's
speak
clearly
and
bluntly
and
then
take
decisive
action
universal
background
checks
red
flag
laws
ending
the
sales
of
weapons
of
war
but
also
importantly
and
politically
difficult
to
say
buy
those
weapons
of
war
back
mandate
that
not
voluntarily
o'rourke
continued
let's
be
really
clear
with
our
fellow
americans
there
is
no
place
for
an
ak-
or
an
ar-
on
the
streets
of
our
communities
the
former
texas
congressman
added
during
an
earlier
appearance
on
cnn's
state
of
the
union
o'rourke
dropped
an
f-bomb
to
emphasize
his
sense
of
urgency
but
he
also
repeated
several
lies
that
are
often
invoked
during
the
gun
control
debate
citing
inflated
numbers
of
gun
violence
and
mass
shootings
o'rourke
began
advocating
mandatory
gun
buybacks
last
month
which
critics
argue
is
essentially
gun
confiscation
veiled
in
softer
rhetoric
o'rourke
would
force
owners
of
firearms
like
the
ar-
to
turn
over
their
rifle
to
the
government
or
face
a
fine
