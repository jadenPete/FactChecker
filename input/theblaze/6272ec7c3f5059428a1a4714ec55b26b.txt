hysteria
around

fires
here's
the
truth
despite
the
widespread
claim
the
amazon
doesn't
produce
of
the
world's
oxygen
while
climate
change
alarmists
spread
fear
over
wildfires
in
the
amazon
rainforest
data
from
nasa
shows
there
is
no
reason
for
concern
or
there
should
have
been
concern
in
past
years
from
media
outlets
to
politicians
the
wildfires
have
sparked
a
wave
of
misinformation
and
hysteria
the
wildfires
are
so
frightening
because
the
amazon
produces
percent
of
the
world's
oxygen
they
claim
others
alleged
the
fires
could
speed
up
climate
change
the
amazon
is
often
referred
to
as
the
lungs
of
the
planet
it's
home
to
of
the
world's
species
and
creates
of
our
oxygen
there
have
been
more
than
fires
in
the
amazon
since

a
massive
increase

however
the
panic
appears
to
be
completely
overblown
according
to
nasa
fires
are
common
in
the
amazon
due
to
the
arrival
of
a
dry
season
in
july
fire
activity
typically
peaks
in
september
before
ending
in
november
and
even
though
fires
are
common
nasa
analysis
shows
that
current
fire
activity
is
at
or
below
average
as
of
august
an
analysis
of
nasa
satellite
data
indicated
that
total
fire
activity
across
the
amazon
basin
this
year
has
been
close
to
the
average
in
comparison
to
the
past
years
the
amazon
spreads
across
brazil
peru
colombia
and
parts
of
other
countries
though
activity
appears
to
be
above
average
in
the
states
of
amazonas
and
rond
nia
it
has
so
far
appeared
below
average
in
mato
grosso
and
par
according
to
estimates
from
the
global
fire
emissions
database
a
research
project
that
compiles
and
analyzes
nasa
data
still
although
large
wildfires
are
concerning
the
claim
that
the
amazon
is
responsible
for
producing
percent
of
the
world's
usable
oxygen
is
simply
not
true
despite
being
commonly
cited
to
intensify
hysteria
