must

jennifer
rubin
told
an
msnbc
panel
we
have
to
level
them
self-described
conservative
washington
post
blogger
jennifer
rubin
says
president
donald
trump
must
be
defeated
and
called
on
her
fellow
americans
to
collectively
in
essence
burn
down
the
republican
party
what
are
the
details
speaking
on
msnbc's
am
joy
on
sunday
rubin
responded
to
the
outrage
over
former
white
house
press
secretary
sean
spicer
becoming
a
competitor
on
dances
with
the
stars
saying
that
trump
administration
alums
should
be
rejected
by
the
public
what
we
should
be
doing
in
shunning
these
people
rubin
said
shunning
shaming
these
people
is
a
statement
of
moral
indignation
that
these
people
are
not
fit
for
a
polite
society
i
think
it's
absolutely
abhorrent
that
any
institution
of
higher
learning
any
news
organization
or
any
entertainment
organization
that
has
a
news
outlet
would
hire
these
people
it's
not
only
that
trump
has
to
lose
but
that
all
his
enablers
have
to
lose
the
columnist
continued
as
other
panelists
nodded
in
agreement
we
have
to
collectively
in
essence
burn
down
the
republican
party
we
have
to
level
them
because
if
there
are
survivors
if
there
are
people
who
weather
this
storm
they
will
do
it
again
they
will
take
this
as
confirmation
that
hey
it
just
pays
to
ride
the
waves
look
at
me
i
made
it
through
and
so
up
and
down
the
ticket
federal
state
and
local
offices
the
country
has
to
repudiate
this
rubin
added
it
is
not
a
normal
administration
the
daily
wire's
ryan
saavedra
posted
a
clip
of
rubin's
comments
on
twitter
anything
else
rubin
has
been
an
outspoken
critic
of
president
donald
trump
and
sunday's
display
was
not
the
first
time
she
has
endorsed
public
harassment
of
current
or
former
members
of
the
administration
last
year
after
then-white
house
press
secretary
sarah
huckabee
sanders
was
mistreated
at
a
virginia
restaurant
rubin
said
of
sanders
and
other
administration
officials
we're
not
going
to
let
these
people
go
through
life
unscathed
adding
that
they
should
be
made
uncomfortable
and
i
think
that's
a
life
sentence
frankly
