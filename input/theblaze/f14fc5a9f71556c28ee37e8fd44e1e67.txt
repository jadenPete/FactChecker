more
from
the

on
a
recent
midweek
afternoon
mr
chang
laid
out
red
and
yellow
cones
on
a
field
at
golden
gate
park
as
an
assistant
brought
in
two
bagfuls
of
rubber
dodgeballs
for
a
tournament
between
eight
teams
he
had
emailed
the
teams
rules
such
as
captains
shall
roshambo
to
determine
sides
roshambo
for
anyone
who
forgot
from

team
t-shirts
he
went
over

get
the
ball
and
shovel
it
in
someone's
face
won't
count
mr
chang
said
of
a
rule
that
players
must
take
three
steps
back
after
grabbing
the
ball
at
the
center
line
at
the
start
of
play
after
a
count
by
mr

unruly
squared
off
in
the
first
of
seven
games
against
the
green-shirted
flying
squirtles
hurling
balls
in
all
directions
the
squirtles
succumbed
in
just
seconds
after
all
six
players
including
ms
fazio
were
eliminated
from
the
field
either
by
being
hit
with
one
of
the
six
balls
in
play
or
having
an
opposing
player
catch
one
of
their
throws
but
after
the
competition
the
dodgeball
players
didn't
take
the
kids
stuff
any
further
they
headed
to
a
bar
instead
of
a
sitting
in
a
classroom
in
front
of
a
blackboard
the
paper
said
guess
adulting
ain't
all
drudgery
