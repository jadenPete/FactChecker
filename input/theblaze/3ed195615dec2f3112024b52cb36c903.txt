faculty
and
staff
at
the
university
of
kansas
sent
a
letter
to
the
school's
chancellor
calling
for
a
boycott
of
chick-fil-a
on
campus
over
the
company's
stance
on
lgbtq
issues
according
to
the
hill
over
the
summer
the
university
allowed
chick-fil-a
to
open
a
location
inside
the
student
union
and
entered
a
contract
agreement
with
the
company
to
sponsor
the
chick-fil-a
coin
toss
at
home
football
games
in
coming
years
faculty
and
staff
have
protested
chick-fil-a's
support
of
organizations
hostile
to
lesbian
gay
bisexual
transgender
and
queer
lgbtq
people
families
and
communities
ku
granted
chick-fil-a
a
bastion
of
bigotry
a
prime
retail
location
in
the
heart
of
our
campus
the
letter
reads
more
from
the
letter
moving
chick-fil-a
to
the
union
and
granting
it
a
role
at
the
start
of
all
home
football
games
violates
the
feelings
of
safety
and
inclusion
that
so
many
of
us
have
striven
to
create
foster
and
protect
on
campus
and
sends
a
message
that
the
union
ku
athletics
and
the
administration
at
large
are
more
concerned
about
money
and
corporate
sponsorship
than
the
physical
emotional
and
mental
well
being
of
marginalized
and
lgbtq
people
the
faculty
and
staff
are
demanding
that
the
university
of
kansas
not
renew
its
contracts
with
chick-fil-a
once
they
expire
and
that
future
decisions
about
companies
to
bring
on
campus
be
more
transparent
principled
and
inclusive
the
letter
also
calls
on
the
campus
community
to
boycott
chick-fil-a
in
the
meantime
while
many
christians
are
supportive
of
the
lgbtq
community
and
many
are
members
themselves
the
culture
of
chick-fil-a
fosters
hate
and
discrimination
on
multiple
levels
the
letter
reads
in
short
chick-fil-a
on
ku's
campus
stands
in
direct
contrast
to
the
university's
mission
of
fostering
a
multicultural
inclusive
environment
