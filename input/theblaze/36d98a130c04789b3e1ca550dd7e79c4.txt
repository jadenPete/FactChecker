than

casting
more
doubt
on
what
happened
jeffrey
epstein's
autopsy
revealed
multiple
broken
bones
in
his
neck
that
are
more
commonly
found
in
homicide
by
strangulation
than
suicide
by
hanging
sources
told
the
washington
post
epstein
a
convicted
sex
offender
who
was
in
prison
on
charges
of
child
sex
trafficking
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
at
the
metropolitan
correctional
center
in
manhattan
on
saturday
morning
having
apparently
hanged
himself
the
autopsy
which
has
not
yet
revealed
a
definitive
cause
of
death
showed
that
epstein's
hyoid
bone
was
broken
the
hyoid
bone
is
near
the
adam's
apple
although
that
bone
can
break
during
a
hanging
especially
if
the
person
is
older
the
hyoid
bone
more
commonly
breaks
during
strangulation
murders
barbara
sampson
new
york
city's
chief
medical
examiner
cautioned
against
taking
a
single
factor
from
an
autopsy
and
using
it
to
draw
a
wider
conclusion
about
the
cause
of
death
in
all
forensic
investigations
all
information
must
be
synthesized
to
determine
the
cause
and
manner
of
death
sampson
said
in
a
statement
everything
must
be
consistent
no
single
finding
can
be
evaluated
in
a
vacuum
epstein's
autopsy
was
completed
on
sunday
but
the
cause
of
death
is
still
listed
as
pending
epstein
was
found
in
his
cell
by
guards
having
apparently
hung
himself
with
a
bedsheet
while
the
broken
hyoid
bone
does
not
automatically
indicate
a
homicide
it
is
cause
for
additional
scrutiny
by
medical
examiners
and
sources
told
the
washington
post
that
sampson's
office
is
seeking
information
about
epstein's
condition
just
before
his
death
including
video
evidence
of
the
jail
hallways
and
a
toxicology
screening
according
to
the
new
york
post
epstein
was
in
good
spirits
in
the
hours
before
his
death
having
told
his
lawyers
i'll
see
you
sunday
during
their
last
meeting
he
was
delusional
a
source
told
the
post
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
the
same
deal
he
got
in
florida
epstein
received
a
favorable
plea
deal
in
that
granted
him
immunity
from
federal
sex
trafficking
charges
in
exchange
for
a
guilty
plea
on
a
state
charge
epstein
served
a
month
prison
sentence
that
included
a
work-release
agreement
that
allowed
him
to
spend
six
days
per
week
in
an
office
