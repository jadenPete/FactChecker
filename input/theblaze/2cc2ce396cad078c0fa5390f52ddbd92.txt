and
since
i
was
harassed
during
that
live
shot
she
tweeted
on
wednesday
i'll
mention
it
here
too
a
major
moment
of
disappointment
this
evening
was
watching
a
crowd
of
people
taunt
police
officers
laughing
and
yelling
at
them
in
the
midst
of
the
gunfire
in
the
live
segment
that
aired
on
wednesday
a
man
and
a
woman
can
be
seen
in
the
background
trying
to
interfere
with
hoff's
reporting
the
cameraman
zooms
in
at
the
end
of
the
report
in
order
to
give
them
less
exposure
i
do
want
to
mention
something
disappointing
that
i
saw
today
said
hoff
during
the
segment
i
did
see
a
crowd
taunting
police
in
the
middle
of
all
of
this
she
added
some
criticized
her
for
even
commenting
on
the
harassment
she
and
the
police
officers
faced
what
is
your
angle
with
saying
this
the
entire
situation
is
disappointing
also
not
everyone
acted
that
way
let's
just
report
the
news
please
and
not
fan
the
flames
of
tensions
between
the
police
and
folks
living
there
said
one
twitter
user
i
have
no
angle
i
am
reporting
on
what
i
saw
here
tonight
it's
a
terrible
situation
with
no
room
for
laughter
she
responded
i
agree
but
can
you
see
how
it
sounds
w
o
more
info
was
laughter
directed
at
police
he
replied
y
would
anyone
laugh
at
police
being
shot
did
you
ask
the
crowd
ur
comments
just
seem
insensitive
and
incomplete
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
people
were
laughing
at
police
no
offense
for
context
we
were
on
a
block
where
police
were
asking
people
to
move
off
the
street
to
the
sidewalk
for
their
safety
hoff
added
a
group
of
approx
people
refused
some
yelling
disparaging
things
others
laughing
at
those
comments
in
the
officer's
faces
hoff
went
to
describe
some
of
the
harassment
she
faced
i
like
talking
to
anyone
i
can
but
was
forced
to
walk
off
after
a
woman
involved
with
the
taunting
yelled
repeatedly
for
me
and
the
camera
to
get
the
f
out
of
here
she
added
now
i
can
take
this
people
are
ugly
to
me
all
the
time
but
also
i
didn't
have
my
colleagues
shot
today
hoff
said
another
online
critic
mocked
her
for
not
having
the
experience
of
a
poc
a
person
of
color
the
online
criticism
appeared
to
take
its
toll
however
later
she
added
a
tweet
to
amend
her
version
of
events
and
tried
to
downplay
the
harassment
i
should
add
of
people
here
on
scene
were
respectful
and
concerned
that
moment
was
just
such
a
startling
thing
to
see
in
the
middle
of
something
so
chaotic
