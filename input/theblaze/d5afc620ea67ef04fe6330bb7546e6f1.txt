joe
biden
drops
to
third
in
national
poll
as
electability
competency
concerns
mount
his
presumed
lead
is
vanishing
a
new
national
poll
shows
that
former
vice
president
joe
biden's
long-held
lead
in
the
democratic
presidential
primary
may
be
evaporating
if
it
hasn't
already
disappeared
the
poll
released
monday
by
monmouth
university
shows
biden
in
third
place
behind
sens
elizabeth
warren
d-mass
and
bernie
sanders
i-vt
presenting
evidence
that
biden's
selling
point
as
the
most
electable
candidate
isn't
holding
up
well
against
his
more
progressive
rivals
warren
percent
sanders
percent
and
biden
percent
are
essentially
in
a
statistical
tie
but
it's
biden's
drop
from
the
previous
poll
that
stands
out
monmouth's
june
poll
had
biden
with
a
significant
lead
at
percent
followed
by
warren
at
percent
and
sanders
at
percent
no
other
candidate
is
in
double
figures
in
either
poll
the
monmouth
poll
results
are
based
on
a
sample
of
registered
voters
who
identify
as
members
of
or
lean
toward
the
democratic
party
data
was
collected
from
aug
the
poll
has
a
percent
margin
of
error
in
the
past
two
months
biden
has
seen
significant
drops
in
support
from
white
democrats
minority
voters
voters
with
and
without
a
college
degree
and
voters
both
over
and
under
the
age
of
with
all
that
support
shifting
in
equal
quantity
to
warren
and
sanders
biden's
biggest
decline
is
seen
among
respondents
in
the
later
primary
states
rather
than
the
earlier
ones
which
can
have
more
influence
over
the
way
a
primary
progresses
biden's
drop
in
support
is
coming
disproportionately
from
later
states
that
have
less
impact
on
the
process
said
patrick
murray
director
of
the
independent
monmouth
university
polling
institute
but
if
this
trend
continues
it
could
spell
trouble
for
him
in
the
early
states
if
it
undermines
his
claim
to
being
the
most
electable
candidate
murray
said
warren
is
the
candidate
with
the
most
momentum
right
now
and
that
sen
kamala
harris
although
only
polling
at
percent
could
still
be
seen
as
a
contender
due
to
her
strength
in
early
states
biden's
campaign
has
been
beset
by
numerous
mistakes
from
the
former
vice
president
raising
questions
about
his
mental
sharpness
and
ability
to
handle
the
rigors
of
the
campaign
and
go
head-to-head
with
president
donald
trump
in
the
general
election
i
want
to
be
clear
i'm
not
going
nuts
biden
felt
compelled
to
tell
a
rally
audience
in
new
hampshire
after
an
interview
in
which
he
appeared
to
think
he
was
in
vermont
