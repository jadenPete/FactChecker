trump
allies
say
rapper
a
ap
rocky
stopped
returning
messages
after
release
from
swedish
jail
ungrateful
motherf
ers
they
just
wanted
him
to
say
thanks
after
the
trump
administration
and
allies
worked
to
secure
the
release
of
rapper
a
ap
rocky
from
jail
in
sweden
where
he
was
charged
with
assault
the
rapper
reportedly
broke
off
all
contact
with
involved
parties
and
never
expressed
gratitude
to
those
who
helped
him
get
home
according
to
yahoo
news
a
ap
rocky
whose
real
name
is
rakim
mayers
spent
nearly
a
month
in
jail
in
sweden
after
being
involved
in
a
street
fight
in
stockholm
on
june
because
the
court
viewed
mayers
and
two
associates
as
flight
risks
a
few
days
after
mayers
was
arrested
two
trump
allies
darrell
scott
a
pastor
and
kareem
lanier
co-chairman
of
scott's
nonprofit
the
urban
revitalization
coalition
got
involved
in
the
case
in
conversations
with
mayers
manager
john
ehmann
scott
and
lanier
say
they
didn't
ask
for
anything
but
gratitude
in
exchange
for
their
intervention
in
the
case
which
they
said
ehmann
agreed
to
scott
and
lanier
then
took
the
issue
to
white
house
adviser
jared
kushner
president
trump's
son-in-law
kushner
was
also
reportedly
hearing
about
this
case
from
kim
kardashian
and
rapper
kanye
west
kushner
took
the
situation
to
president
trump
who
then
assigned
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
to
take
the
lead
in
securing
mayers
release
president
trump
spoke
to
scott
and
lanier
in
person
on
july
when
he
was
in
cleveland
and
later
on
the
phone
with
scott
asking
for
their
opinions
about
mayers
they
vouched
for
him
and
encouraged
the
president
to
work
on
his
behalf
about
a
week
later
trump
began
speaking
publicly
about
his
desire
to
see
mayers
released
despite
trump's
advocacy
the
efforts
ultimately
didn't
seem
to
make
much
difference
as
mayers
was
not
released
until
his
trial
ended
on
aug
he
was
later
convicted
of
the
assault
but
not
sentenced
to
any
further
jail
time
the
rapper
released
a
generic
statement
of
gratitude
but
didn't
mention
scott
lanier
or
president
trump
for
their
efforts
scott
said
it
was
embarrassing
to
have
to
tell
kushner
that
mayers
and
his
team
were
unresponsive
after
his
release
i
was
like
man
you
ungrateful
motherf
ers
you
lanier
said
recalling
a
conversation
with
mayers
manager
i
can't
believe
you
we
didn't
ask
you
guys
for
nothing
other
than
for
you
guys
to
be
grateful
we
just
want
you
guys
to
be
appreciative
and
say
thank
you
