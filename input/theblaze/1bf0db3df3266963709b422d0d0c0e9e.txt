san
francisco
nixes
criminal
labels
such
as
felon
and
inmate
replacing
them
with
more
person-
first
terms
the
city
has
sanitized
its
word
choices
regarding
the
criminal
justice
system
the
san
francisco
board
of
supervisors
says
terms
such
as
felon
and
inmate
are
a
dehumanizing
way
of
referring
to
individuals
with
a
criminal
record
and
have
adopted
a
new
set
of
guidelines
requiring
the
use
of
alternative
person-first
labels
what
are
the
details
the
resolution
approved
by
all
members
present
last
month
states
that
dehumanizing
language
like
prisoner
convict
inmate
or
felon
only
serve
to
obstruct
and
separate
from
society
and
make
the
institutionalization
of
racism
and
supremacy
appear
normal
several
new
descriptive
terms
were
provided
to
serve
as
models
of
appropriate
use
of
person-first
language
for
instance
instead
of
referring
to
an
individual
as
an
inmate
one
should
use
the
term
currently
incarcerated
person
rather
than
call
someone
a
juvenile
offender
the
person
should
be
described
as
a
young
person
impacted
by
the
justice
system
the
term
illegal
alien
was
also
scrubbed
and
replaced
by
person
or
individual
an
addict
or
substance
abuser
will
now
be
called
a
person
with
a
history
of
substance
abuse
supervisor
matt
haney
explained
the
measure
to
the
san
francisco
chronicle
saying
we
don't
want
people
to
be
forever
labeled
for
the
worst
things
that
they
have
done
we
want
them
ultimately
to
become
contributing
citizens
and
referring
to
them
as
felons
is
like
a
scarlet
letter
that
they
can
never
get
away
from
according
to
the
chronicle
the
district
attorney's
office
is
already
on
board
but
the
resolution
is
nonbinding
and
mayor
london
breed
did
not
sign
off
on
it
because
according
to
her
spokesperson
she
doesn't
implement
policies
based
on
nonbinding
resolutions
anything
else
fox
news
reported
that
san
francisco's
adoption
of
the
new
guidelines
comes
as
the
city
reels
from
one
of
the
highest
crime
rates
in
the
country
and
staggering
inequality
exemplified
by
pervasive
homelessness
alongside
silicon
valley
wealth
the
outlet
said
the
sanitized
language
is
unlikely
to
do
much
to
address
the
crime
problem
and
suggested
the
new
descriptors
could
cause
more
confusion
