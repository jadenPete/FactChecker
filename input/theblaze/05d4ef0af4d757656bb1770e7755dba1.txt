that
cruz
had
taken
no
action
in
the
senate
to
stop
mass
killings
such
as
the
one
in
the
odessa
area
you
and
your
broken
heart
she
wrote
fakeyou
you
are
spineless
and
utterly
without
morality
or
shame
your
words
mean
zero
you
keep
repeating
the
same
sentiments
and
take
no
action
in
the
senate
the
chamber
where
you
could
actually
bring
some
change
to
america
if
you
really
cared
cruz
responded
in
kind
with
serious
kindness
bette
you're
an
amazing
singer
but
spewing
hate
insults
only
contributes
to
the
tragic
division
in
our
nation
he
wrote
i've
led
the
fight
in
the
senate
to
stop
felons
those
w
serious
mental
illness
from
getting
guns
he
also
pointed
to
a
piece
of
legislation
that
would
have
kept
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
people
with
severe
mental
illness
democrats
filibustered
the
legislation
in
anything
else
cruz
wasn't
the
only
texas
lawmaker
in
midler's
sights
she
also
took
aim
at
rep
matt
schaefer
r-texas
who
tweeted
a
pointed
response
to
the
massacre
on
saturday
in
response
to
the
mass
killing
schaefer
wrote
what
can
we
do
yes
to
praying
for
victims
yes
to
praying
for
protection
yes
to
praying
that
god
would
transform
the
hearts
of
people
with
evil
intent
yes
to
fathers
not
leaving
their
wives
and
children
yes
to
discipline
in
the
homes
midler
responded
by
calling
schaefer
an
idiot
she
wrote
you
sir
are
an
idiot
you
put
guns
above
the
people
who
elected
you
to
keep
them
from
getting
killed
guns
don't
vote
people
do
and
you
sir
are
on
the
way
out
because
you
allow
death
to
stalk
your
innocent
god-fearing
constituents
every
single
day
