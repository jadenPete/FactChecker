nypd
detectives
plead
guilty
to
felony
bribery
and
abuse
of
power
but
will
not
serve
jail
time
in
sexual
assault
case
attorneys
for
the
alleged
victim
called
the
plea
deal
outrageous
according
to
the
new
york
times
two
nypd
detectives
have
pleaded
guilty
to
bribery
and
abuse
of
power
charges
and
will
receive
five
years
probation
as
part
of
a
plea
deal
in
a
sexual
assault
case
stemming
from
an
incident
in
the
detectives
edward
martins
and
richard
hall
arrested
an
year-old
woman
in
for
possession
of
a
small
amount
of
marijuana
what
happened
next
remains
the
subject
of
factual
dispute
the
woman
whose
real
name
has
not
been
released
to
the
media
but
has
sued
the
city
under
the
pseudonym
anna
chambers
claimed
that
the
officers
physically
restrained
her
and
forcibly
sexually
assaulted
her
investigators
found
dna
evidence
to
corroborate
chambers
claim
that
the
officers
had
sex
with
her
the
officers
were
originally
charged
with
rape
and
faced
a
potential
prison
sentence
of
years
they
quit
the
force
in
november
however
attorneys
for
the
officers
claimed
that
rather
than
a
forcible
rape
the
woman
had
consensual
sex
with
the
officers
in
exchange
for
being
released
from
custody
the
officers
admitted
that
they
took
turns
having
sex
with
the
woman
in
the
back
of
a
police
van
as
they
drove
her
around
new
york
city
but
claimed
that
the
sexual
encounter
was
chambers
idea
and
that
she
offered
to
have
sex
with
the
officers
if
they
released
her
without
reporting
the
arrest
ultimately
prosecutors
found
a
number
of
inconsistencies
in
chambers
story
which
led
to
the
rape
charges
being
dropped
in
march
in
response
to
the
incident
the
new
york
legislature
passed
a
law
making
it
illegal
for
police
officers
to
have
sex
with
suspects
who
are
in
custody
but
the
law
could
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
martins
and
hall
prosecutors
indicted
martins
and
hall
on
lesser
felony
charges
of
receiving
a
bribe
and
misdemeanor
charges
of
official
misconduct
and
intended
to
proceed
to
trial
which
was
set
to
begin
sept
prosecutors
and
defense
attorneys
had
reached
an
impasse
in
negotiating
a
plea
deal
until
brooklyn
supreme
court
justice
danny
chun
on
thursday
agreed
to
accept
a
no-jail-time
plea
deal
from
the
defendants
over
the
objections
of
prosecutors
who
had
argued
for
a
one-to-three
year
jail
sentence
had
they
gone
to
trial
and
been
convicted
they
would
have
faced
up
to
seven
years
in
prison
in
explaining
his
decision
to
accept
the
plea
deal
chun
pointed
to
the
history
of
the
case
and
stated
his
belief
that
he
did
not
believe
a
jury
would
have
convicted
the
former
officers
of
the
felony
bribe
receiving
charges
attorneys
for
chambers
joined
prosecutors
in
objecting
to
the
no-jail-time
sentence
chambers
has
consistently
insisted
that
she
was
in
fact
forcibly
raped
and
has
stated
that
the
inconsistencies
in
her
story
are
common
with
rape
victims
who
have
gone
through
a
traumatic
experience
chambers
attorney
michael
david
told
wabc-tv
this
is
outrageous
that
they
can
rape
my
client
and
not
serve
any
jail
time
