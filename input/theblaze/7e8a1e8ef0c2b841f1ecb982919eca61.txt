senate
democrats
running
for
president
are
missing
an
unusually
high
number
of
votes
neglecting
their
day
job
senate
democrats
who
are
pursuing
their
party's
presidential
nomination
are
also
severely
neglecting
the
obligations
of
their
current
jobs
according
to
the
washington
examiner
it's
not
new
for
lawmakers
to
miss
congressional
votes
while
running
for
a
larger
office
but
this
group
of
senators
is
missing
votes
at
a
noticeably
higher
rate
than
previous
candidate
pools
some
senators
have
missed
nearly
percent
of
senate
floor
votes
this
year
sen
cory
booker
n.
j
leads
the
way
having
missed
percent
of
votes
followed
by
sen
kamala
harris
calif
at
percent
and
bernie
sanders
vt
and
kirsten
gillibrand
n.y.
at
percent
yes
sen
gillibrand
who
is
polling
at
or
percent
in
many
national
polls
is
committing
so
much
time
to
her
presidential
campaign
that
she
is
missing
percent
of
senate
votes
sen
elizabeth
warren
is
doing
a
bit
better
than
the
other
front-runner
senators
having
missed
percent
of
this
year's
votes
michael
bennet
of
colorado
has
missed
percent
and
amy
klobuchar
of
minnesota
has
missed
percent
on
average
democratic
senators
have
missed
percent
of
votes
this
year
in
fairness
these
aren't
the
worst
numbers
we've
ever
seen
from
a
senator
with
presidential
ambitions
in
late
former
sen
john
mccain
missed
percent
of
votes
the
statistics
for
the
democrats
don't
compare
favorably
to
dems
however
then-sen
joe
biden
of
delaware
missed
percent
of
votes
in
barack
obama
missed
percent
and
hillary
clinton
missed
only
percent
the
democratic
senators
are
also
absent
more
than
the
candidates
were
in
texas
gop
sen
ted
cruz
missed
percent
of
votes
sen
rand
paul
of
kentucky
missed
percent
and
sanders
only
missed
percent
that
year
missed
votes
won't
really
matter
for
the
person
who
wins
the
nomination
and
possibly
the
presidency
but
for
those
who
will
have
to
return
to
the
senate
and
run
for
reelection
in
the
coming
years
it
won't
look
great
that
if
they
were
only
showing
up
to
represent
their
states
roughly
half
the
time
as
they
tried
to
move
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
