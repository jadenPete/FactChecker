you
re
visible
now
you
scumbag
trump
campaign
manager
lashes
out
at
media
targeting
his
wife
this
is
a
disgusting
trick
brad
parscale
the
manager
for
the
trump
re-election
campaign
lashed
out
against
the
media
over
reports
about
his
wife's
dealings
with
a
pro-trump
super
political
action
committee
cnn
are
liars
trying
to
write
a
dirty
story
about
my
wife
i
own
all
my
companies
parscale
tweeted
friday
my
wife
is
member
on
some
of
them
to
do
filings
and
bookkeeping
this
is
a
disgusting
trick
to
make
a
very
simple
thing
look
nefarious
he
added
her
last
name
is
parscale
what
would
that
hide
he
called
out
a
cnn
editor
in
a
second
tweet
adding
you're
visible
now
you
scumbag
the
cnn
story
questioned
payments
made
to
parscale's
wife
from
a
pro-trump
super
pac
named
america
first
action
that
was
first
established
in
the
report
documents
paid
to
red
state
data
and
digital
which
is
founded
by
candice
parscale
federal
election
experts
told
cnn
the
arrangement
raises
concerns
about
coordination
between
a
super
pac
and
the
official
campaign
which
is
forbidden
by
election
law
this
is
a
perfectly
legal
and
appropriate
arrangement
which
is
firewalled
with
zero
chance
for
coordination
brad
parscale
said
to
cnn
about
the
accusations
but
on
twitter
he
was
much
more
acerbic
about
the
report
i'm
going
to
start
calling
out
editors
that
attack
us
viciously
and
hide
behind
writers
that
can't
control
their
own
headlines
journalists
get
blamed
but
the
editors
are
the
true
evil
he
tweeted
cnn's
adam
levine
attacked
my
wife
with
zero
visibility
he
added
you're
visible
now
you
scumbag
in
a
later
tweet
he
said
he
was
turning
off
the
news
for
the
labor
day
weekend
and
added
cnn
sucks
