prolific
yale
professor
turns
against
darwinism
warns
darwinians
will
destroy
you
if
you
challenge
the
theory
sounds
rather
militant
actually
david
gelernter
prominent
writer
and
yale
university
professor
believes
it's
high
time
for
people
to
drop
charles
darwin's
outdated
theory
of
evolution
gelernter
explained
that
he
has
dissociated
himself
from
the
theory
and
has
received
backlash
for
doing
so
what
are
the
details
in
a
recent
essay
published
in
the
claremont
review
of
books
gelernter
wrote
darwin
has
failed
and
insisted
that
scientists
move
past
darwin
and
his
theories
altogether
gelernter
who
has
been
a
proponent
of
darwinism
since
childhood
argued
that
the
longstanding
theory
of
evolution
simply
doesn't
give
a
thorough
enough
explanation
of
perhaps
the
most
important
component
of
modern
science
the
actual
origin
of
species
according
to
the
essay
titled
giving
up
darwin
the
cambrian
explosion
as
well
as
modern
discoveries
in
molecular
biology
have
dashed
darwin's
theories
of
evolution
as
he
understood
it
to
occur
most
species
enter
the
evolutionary
order
fully
formed
and
then
depart
unchanged
gelernter
wrote
the
incremental
development
of
new
species
is
largely
not
there
he
also
added
that
he
feels
it
is
important
not
to
discount
the
theory
of
intelligent
design
which
is
an
equally
important
concept
as
darwinism
has
been
to
science
darwin's
theory
predicts
that
new
life
forms
evolve
gradually
from
old
ones
in
a
constantly
branching
spreading
tree
of
life
he
wrote
those
brave
new
cambrian
creatures
must
therefore
have
had
precambrian
predecessors
similar
but
not
quite
as
fancy
and
sophisticated
they
could
not
have
all
blown
out
suddenly
like
a
bunch
of
geysers
he
pointed
out
that
the
concept
of
intelligent
design
is
not
necessarily
his
favorite
theory
but
insists
that
it
is
an
absolutely
serious
argument
pointing
out
that
the
theory
is
the
very
first
and
obviously
most
intuitive
that
comes
to
mind
what
else
in
june
gelernter
said
that
darwinian
scientists
will
absolutely
destroy
those
people
who
dare
try
to
diminish
its
importance
to
science
i
have
to
distinguish
between
the
way
i've
been
treated
personally
which
has
been
a
very
courteous
and
collegial
way
by
my
colleagues
at
yale
they're
nice
guys
and
i
like
them
they're
my
friends
he
said
in
june
remarks
on
the
other
hand
when
i
look
at
their
intellectual
behavior
what
they
publish
and
much
more
important
what
they
tell
their
students
darwinism
has
indeed
passed
beyond
a
scientific
argument
as
far
as
they
are
concerned
take
your
life
in
your
hands
to
challenge
it
intellectually
he
continued
they
will
destroy
you
if
you
challenge
it
i
haven't
seen
anything
approaching
free
speech
on
this
topic
gelernter
admitted
it's
a
bitter
rejection
not
just
a
sort
of
bitter
fundamental
angry
outraged
violent
rejection
which
comes
nowhere
near
scientific
of
intellectual
discussion
i've
seen
that
happen
again
and
again
i'm
a
darwinist
don't
you
say
a
word
against
it
or
i
don't
wanna
hear
it
period
i
am
attacking
their
religion
he
concluded
it
is
a
big
issue
for
them
mathematical
challenges
to
darwin's
theory
of
evolution
