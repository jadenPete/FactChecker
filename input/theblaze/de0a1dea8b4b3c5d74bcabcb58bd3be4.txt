china's
re-statement
of
its

controversially
trump
also
ordered
american

to

want
to
do
something

said
at
the

want
calm
and
that's
a
great
thing
frankly
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
he's
a
great
leader
president
xi
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
china's
a
great
country
is
they
understand
how
life
works
the
president
added
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
over
the
weekend
if
china
would
agree
to
a
fair
and
balanced
relationship
we
would
sign
that
deal
in
a
second
china
has
previously
expressed
willingness
to
resolve
the
trade
dispute
in

for
two
days
of
