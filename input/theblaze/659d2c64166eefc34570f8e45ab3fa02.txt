women's
national
team
ends
talks
with
us
soccer
over
equal
pay
we
should
be
paid
the
same
as
our
male
counterparts
the
lawsuit
continues
talks
between
the
united
states
soccer
federation
and
the
women's
national
team
ended
without
resolution
wednesday
as
the
national
team
drew
a
hard
line
in
the
sand
over
the
equal
pay
dispute
according
to
espn
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
a
federal
court
battle
the
two
sides
were
taking
part
in
mediation
sessions
ultimately
however
the
women's
national
team
felt
the
talks
were
going
nowhere
we
entered
this
week's
mediation
with
representatives
of
u.s.
soccer
full
of
hope
said
u.s.
women's
national
team
spokeswoman
molly
levinson
according
to
yahoo
sports
today
we
must
conclude
these
meetings
sorely
disappointed
in
the
federation's
determination
to
perpetuate
fundamentally
discriminatory
workplace
conditions
and
behavior
megan
rapinoe
captain
of
the
team
that
just
won
the
women's
world
cup
assessed
the
situation
more
bluntly
saying
that
fully
equal
pay
for
the
women's
and
men's
teams
was
a
non-negotiable
starting
point
when
we
play
a
game
and
we
win
that
game
or
we
tie
that
game
or
we
lose
that
game
that
we
should
be
paid
the
same
as
our
male
counterparts
rapinoe
said
on
nbc
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
unrealistic
or
unreasonable
ask
to
have
equality
the
ussf
has
presented
data
showing
that
from
through
women's
players
have
received
nearly
million
more
overall
in
salaries
and
bonuses
than
the
men's
players
despite
the
men
generating
nearly
twice
as
much
in
gross
revenue
per
game
from
through
the
comparison
between
men's
and
women's
soccer
team
pay
is
quite
complicated
considering
the
two
pay
structures
are
completely
different
and
they
were
collectively
bargained
separately
even
rapinoe
acknowledged
that
the
realities
are
different
although
that
doesn't
change
her
opinion
additionally
she
knows
that
the
team
and
the
federation
are
stuck
together
that's
the
only
federation
we
can
play
for
we're
the
only
team
that
they
have
so
we're
sort
of
tethered
together
in
that
way
she
said
but
at
any
point
if
they
want
to
have
a
serious
conversation
and
are
willing
to
not
only
talk
about
paying
us
equally
and
valuing
us
in
that
way
but
actually
doing
it
and
showing
us
that
they'll
do
it
our
ears
are
always
open
i
don't
think
anybody
wants
to
go
to
litigation
but
with
that
said
we're
very
confident
in
our
case
the
ussf
didn't
have
much
to
say
about
the
talks
breaking
down
issuing
a
statement
expressing
how
it
values
the
women's
national
team
we
always
know
there
is
more
we
can
do
u.s.
soccer
said
in
a
statement
we
value
our
players
and
have
continually
shown
that
by
providing
them
with
compensation
and
support
that
exceeds
any
other
women's
team
in
the
world
