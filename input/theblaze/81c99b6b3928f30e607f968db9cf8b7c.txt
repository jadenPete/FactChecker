former
brett
kavanaugh
classmate
sues
huffpost
for
defamation
over
high
school
drug
allegations
the
lawsuit
calls
huffpost's
report
outrageously
defamatory
a
mississippi
professor
who
went
to
high
school
with
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
is
suing
liberal
news
outlet
huffpost
for
defamation
over
a
report
that
claimed
he
and
a
friend
arranged
the
purchase
and
delivery
of
cocaine
leading
to
the
death
of
a
classmate
according
to
the
clarion-ledger
the
professor
derrick
evans
attended
georgetown
prep
in
the
s
with
kavanaugh
and
was
named
in
a
huffpost
article
from
september
that
portrayed
the
school
as
having
an
alcohol-and-drug-fueled
culture
the
huffpost
article
reported
that
evans
and
his
friend
douglas
kennedy
obtained
cocaine
that
resulted
in
the
death
of
douglas
brother
david
kennedy
son
of
late
sen
robert
f.
kennedy
these
statements
were
not
only
false
and
defamatory
but
outrageously
so
and
were
published
by
defendants
with
knowledge
of
their
actual
falsity
or
in
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth
for
the
apparent
purpose
of
creating
a
salacious
story
designed
to
drive
internet
traffic
to
huffposts
website
the
lawsuit
claims
the
article
was
published
in
the
midst
of
the
contentious
confirmation
process
for
kavanaugh
whose
appointment
to
the
supreme
court
was
nearly
derailed
by
sexual
assault
and
misconduct
allegations
most
notably
from
christine
blasey
ford
much
of
the
narrative
constructed
against
kavanaugh
sought
to
portray
him
as
a
product
of
and
participant
in
a
culture
of
sexual
misbehavior
and
alcohol
abuse
defendants
had
no
sources
to
support
their
outrageously
false
and
defamatory
statements
about
derrick
evans
and
douglas
kennedy
the
lawsuit
read
nor
did
defendants
make
any
effort
whatsoever
to
contact
mr
evans
for
comment
before
accusing
him
not
only
of
committing
a
crime
but
of
being
responsible
for
the
death
of
david
kennedy
indeed
if
ms
ashley
feinberg
the
article's
author
or
her
huffpost
editors
had
done
even
the
most
basic
research
of
publicly
available
sources
she
and
they
would
have
known
if
they
did
not
already
know
that
mr
evans
actively
assisted
law
enforcement
in
identifying
and
prosecuting
the
individuals
who
actually
sold
the
illegal
narcotics
it
continued
evans
is
seeking
unspecified
damages
huffpost
initially
issued
a
correction
which
the
lawsuit
claims
was
also
false
and
eventually
all
references
to
evans
and
the
kennedy
brothers
were
removed
from
the
story
huffpost
told
the
clarion-ledger
it
does
not
comment
on
pending
litigation
