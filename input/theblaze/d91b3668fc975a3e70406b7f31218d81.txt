thinks
more
informed
millennials
are
first
generation
to
go
to
the
streets
to
protest
young
people
are
more
informed
and
dynamic
than
their
predecessors
they
actually
take
time
to
read
and
understand
our
history
in
a
recent
instagram
video
rep
alexandria
ocasio-cortez
d-n
y.
said
that
her
generation
is
more
courageous
than
their
predecessors
because
they're
actually
willing
to
go
to
the
streets
to
protest
apparently
she
hasn't
heard
of
the
civil
rights
movement
or
the
vietnam
war
protests
or
restoring
honor
to
name
a
few
i
think
young
people
are
more
informed
and
dynamic
than
their
predecessors
ocasio-cortez
said
i
think
this
new
generation
is
very
profound
and
very
strong
and
very
brave
because
they're
actually
willing
to
go
to
the
streets
how
about
that
like
previous
generations
have
just
assumed
that
government's
got
it
let
me
tell
you
something
you
are
the
government
like
as
a
democracy
we
the
people
as
a
voter
you
are
the
government
too
ironically
her
claims
were
immediately
preceded
by
her
boasting
that
unlike
older
generations
young
people
actually
take
time
to
read
and
understand
our
history
the
history
of
the
labor
movement
history
of
civil
rights
history
of
economics
history
of
the
united
states
history
of
colonialism
and
they're
not
afraid
to
have
those
conversations
on
thursday's
radio
program
glenn
beck
and

burguiere
reacted
to
the
freshman
congresswoman's
latest
ludicrous
statements

of
things

honor

th
anniversary
of
the
march
on
washington

glenn
continued
on
september
th
we
all
stood
together
bravely
both
republicans
and
democrats
in
this
democracy
and
we
stood
up
and
we
held
hands
and
we
prayed
together
because
we
weren't
going
to
be
bowing
to
fear
after
somebody
took
our
world
trade
center
down
and
then
when
the
government
got
out
of
control
and
was
just
taxing
us
to
death
and
telling
us
they
wanted
socialism
