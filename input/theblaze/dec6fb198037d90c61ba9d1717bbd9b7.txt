black
trump
voters
are
mentally
ill
alabama
pastor
says
and
the
white
trump
voters
are
racists
the
pastor
of
a
birmingham
alabama
church
posted
a
sign
out
front
saying
black
people
who
vote
for
president
donald
trump
are
mentally
ill
and
white
people
who
vote
for
him
are
racist
according
to
wvtm-tv
pastor
michael
jordan
of
new
era
baptist
church
defended
the
sign
which
read
a
black
vote
for
trump
is
mental
illness
on
one
side
and
a
white
vote
for
trump
is
pure
racism
on
the
other
god
motivates
me
to
take
a
stand
for
what's
right
jordan
told
wvtm
read
the
bible
and
look
in
the
white
house
if
they're
calling
me
a
racist
look
in
the
white
house
when
you
vote
for
donald
trump
you
are
supporting
institutionalized
racism
jordan
already
has
a
reputation
as
a
racially
divisive
minister
in
jordan
posted
a
sign
that
read
black
folks
need
to
stay
out
of
white
churches
on
one
side
and
white
folks
refused
to
be
our
neighbors
on
the
other
the
signs
were
a
response
to
a
megachurch
opening
a
satellite
campus
in
birmingham
to
help
reduce
crime
you
don't
want
to
live
next
door
to
us
so
why
do
you
want
to
put
a
church
here
if
they
don't
know
us
jordan
said
at
the
time
and
i
am
condemning
the
black
african
americans
that
worship
white
churches
because
the
culture
is
so
different
jordan's
latest
signs
could
put
his
church's
tax-exempt
status
in
jeopardy

some
residents
took
issue
with
jordan's
political
statement
and
confronted
him
while
he
was
being
interviewed
by
