the
biden
campaign
had
questioned
the
results
monmouth
university
has
issued
a
statement
dismissing
its
latest
poll
as
an
outlier
after
it
showed
democratic
presidential
front-runner
joe
biden
appeared
to
have
lost
his
perceived
lead
in
the
race
what
are
the
details
on
monday
monmouth
released
a
national
poll
showing
biden
was
in
third
place
behind
fellow
contenders
sens
bernie
sanders
vt
and
elizabeth
warren
mass
in
a
statistical
tie
theblaze's
aaron
colen
reported
that
it's
biden's
drop
from
the
previous
monmouth
poll
that
stands
out
in
june
biden
held
the
lead
at
percent
according
to
a
monmouth
poll
dropping
to
percent
within
just
a
few
months
immediately
following
the
results
of
the
second
survey
poll
director
patrick
murray
told
the
new
york
times
the
main
takeaway
from
this
poll
is
that
the
democratic
race
has
become
volatile
liberal
voters
are
starting
to
cast
about
for
a
candidate
they
can
identify
with
moderate
voters
who
have
been
paying
less
attention
seem
to
be
expressing
doubts
about
biden
now
murray
says
he
does
not
have
confidence
in
the
results
of
the
second
survey
wednesday
murray
issued
a
statement
dismissing
monday's
poll
as
an
outlier
echoing
a
claim
from
the
biden
campaign
as
other
national
polls
of
democratic
presidential
race
have
been
released
this
week
it
is
clear
that
the
monmouth
university
poll
published
monday
is
an
outlier
murray
wrote
this
is
a
product
of
the
uncertainty
that
is
inherent
in
the
polling
process
fox
news
reported
that
the
biden
campaign
had
pushed
back
against
the
poll
ahead
of
monmouth's
renunciation
saying
this
poll
is
an
outlier
that
is
contradicted
by
every
measure
of
the
national
average
democratic
strategist
jesse
ferguson
told
the
outlet
you
can
quickly
over-read
into
this
poll
but
added
if
i
was
the
biden
campaign
there
are
lots
of
things
that
would
keep
me
up
at
night
this
poll
isn't
one
of
them
