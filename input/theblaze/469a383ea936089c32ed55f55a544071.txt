former
vice

joe
biden
responded
to
the
mass
murder
in
odessa
texas
by
calling
for
a
ban
on
gun
magazines
that
hold
multiple
bullets
in
them
as
well
as
an
assault
weapons
ban
this
idea
that
we
don't
have
elimination
of
assault-type
weapons
magazines
that
can
have
hold
multiple
bullets
in
them
is
absolutely
mindless
biden
said
monday
it
is
no
violation
of
the
second
amendment
it's
just
a
bow
to
the
special
interests
the
gun
manufacturers
and
the
nra
it's
gotta
stop
biden
was
commenting
on
gun
control
after
a
gunman
shot
and
killed
seven
people
in
west
texas
over
the
weekend
less
than
a
month
after
mass
murders
in
el
paso
and
dayton
ohio
biden
who
is
in
the
news
nearly
daily
for
strange
jumbled
or
outright
false
statements
presumably
was
referring
to
high-capacity
magazines
something
that
is
often
cited
alongside
assault
weapons
as
a
target
for
gun
control
advocates
the
alternative
explanation
if
he
actually
meant
what
he
said
would
result
in
the
banning
of
nearly
every
gun
in
the
country
of
course
biden
is
not
exactly
a
terminology
expert
when
it
comes
to
firearms
and
may
not
be
fully
clear
on
what
a
magazine
is
last
month
he
asked
attendees
at
a
fundraiser
there
is
no
rationale
for
us
to
have
these
assault
weapons
who
needs
a
clip
that
can
hold
rounds
biden
also
attacked
president
donald
trump
for
his
perceived
inaction
toward
stopping
or
reducing
occurrences
of
mass
murder
i've
seen
nothing
the
president
has
no
intestinal
fortitude
to
deal
with
this
biden
said
he
knows
better
his
instinct
was
to
say
yeah
we're
going
to
do
something
on
background
checks
what's
he
doing
come
on
this
is
disgraceful
this
is
disgraceful
what's
happening
