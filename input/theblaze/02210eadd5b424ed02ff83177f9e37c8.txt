the

the

family
who
hadn't
heard
from
her
for
a
few
days
began
to
worry
and
drove
to
her
home
to
determine
their
mother's
whereabouts
they
likely
didn't
expect
to
find
her
lying
in
sewage
in
her
own
yard
in
my
entire
career
i
can't
imagine
another

richard
anderson
told
kptv
she
hadn't
been
heard
from
by
her
family
for
a
couple
days
over

so
the

decided
to
drive
up
and
check
on
her

when
they
found
her
down
in
the
tank
and

get
us
started
to

added
we
could

anderson
said
pointing
out
that
firefighters
discovered
her
approximately
three
feet
into
the
hole
we
could
communicate
with
her
we
really
just
needed
to
get
some
resources
there
the
woman
was
able
to
grab
onto
one
of
the
rescuer's
apparatuses
and
pull
herself
up
while
other
responders
secured
a
strap
around
her
to
pull
her
from
the
hole
she
was
transported
to
a
nearby
hospital
to
be
checked
for
injuries

on

a

had
been
dug
