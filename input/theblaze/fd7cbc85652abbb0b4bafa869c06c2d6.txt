mike
pence
responds
to
reports
of
eyebrow-raising
trump
comments
to
aides
fake
news
it
just
seems
like
not
a
day
goes
by
that
somebody
in
the
media
doesn't
find
something
to
print
or
publish
or
put
on
the
internet
vice
president
mike
pence
responded
to
recent
reports
of
president
trump's
comments
to
aides
explaining
the
white
house's
interest
in
greenland
and
dismissing
the
notion
that
trump
asked
about
using
nuclear
weapons
to
stop
hurricanes
as
fake
news
in
an
interview
with
blazetv
host
eric
bolling
to
air
tuesday
bolling
asked
pence
about
the
trump
administration's
interest
in
the
region
after
reports
surfaced
that
president
trump
had
inquired
with
his
aides
about
the
possibility
of
buying
greenland
from
the
danish
government
pence
explained
that
the
autonomous
region
of
the
kingdom
of
denmark
holds
several
strategic
interests
for
u.s.
national
security
the
strategic
importance
of
the
arctic
virtually
grows
by
the
day
and
we
continue
to
see
russia
and
china
seek
to
extend
their
influence
into
the
arctic
region
and
i
think
the
president
was
interested
in
engaging
in
a
discussion
with
denmark
pence
said
although
some
pundits
mocked
the
president
for
his
wacky
idea
and
the
government
of
greenland
rebuffed
the
purchase
offer
some
like
sen
tom
cotton
r-ark
support
the
idea
arguing
the
region
holds
strategic
importance
to
confront
china
pence
noted
that
greenland's
strategic
importance
is
one
reason
the
u.s.
maintains
a
military
base
there
greenland
is
a
part
of
north
america
first
and
foremost
and
so
from
a
security
standpoint
it
makes
more
sense
we
have
a
military
base
there
now
it
makes
more
sense
for
the
united
states
to
have
a
dominant
role
in
greenland
just
in
the
interest
of
our
own
national
security
and
our
sphere
of
influence
in
this
hemisphere
pence
said
but
beyond
that
i
think
it's
just
an
opportunity
that
i
think
the
president
was
interested
in
discussing
with
the
leadership
in
denmark
and
who
knows
if
some
day
down
the
road
it
might
be
a
topic
that
they're
willing
to
broach
he
added
bolling
also
asked
the
vice
president
about
a
report
from
axios
jonathan
swan
that
the
president
suggested
to
aides
that
nuclear
weapons
might
be
used
against
hurricanes
to
stop
them
from
reaching
the
united
states
i
got
it
i
got
it
why
don't
we
nuke
them
the
president
reportedly
said
during
a
meeting
with
national
security
officials
they
start
forming
off
the
coast
of
africa
as
they're
moving
across
the
atlantic
we
drop
a
bomb
inside
the
eye
of
the
hurricane
and
it
disrupts
it
why
can't
we
do
that
president
trump
dismissed
the
report
as
ridiculous
and
denied
ever
saying
such
a
thing
the
story
by
axios
that
president
trump
wanted
to
blow
up
large
hurricanes
with
nuclear
weapons
prior
to
reaching
shore
is
ridiculous
i
never
said
this
just
more
fake
news
donald

august
pence
echoed
the
president's
dismissal
the
president's
made
it
very
clear
that
he's
never
made
a
suggestion
like
that
and
i've
never
heard
him
make
a
suggestion
like
that
we've
got
a
term
for
that
sort
of
thing
at
the
white
house
it's
called
fake
news
he
told
bolling
it
just
seems
like
not
a
day
goes
by
that
somebody
in
the
media
doesn't
find
something
to
print
or
publish
or
put
on
the
internet
he
added
but
it's
one
of
the
things
i
most
admire
about
this
president
is
no
matter
what
the
media
is
out
there
talking
about
on
any
given
day
no
matter
what
the
critics
or
the
naysayers
are
talking
about
this
is
a
president
who
literally
gets
up
every
day
and
fights
to
keep
the
promises
that
he
made
to
the
american
people
