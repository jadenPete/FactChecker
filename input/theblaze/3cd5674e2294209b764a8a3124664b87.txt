a
judge
in
missouri
just
blocked
the
state's
week
abortion
ban
about
half
the
reported
abortions
in
missouri
took
place
after
the
eighth
week
of
pregnancy
according
to
ruling
on
wednesday
a
federal
judge
blocked
missouri's
eight-week
abortion
ban
what
law
missouri
passed
a
law
in
may
that
would
ban
abortions
after
eight
weeks
gestation
abortion
supporters
protested
the
rule
arguing
that
this
was
too
close
to
when
many
women
would
find
out
that
they
were
pregnant
to
begin
with
doctors
who
broke
this
law
and
performed
abortions
could
face
up
to
years
behind
bars
it
has
an
exception
for
medical
emergencies
but
none
for
rape
or
incest
what
happened
now
in
his
decision
u.s.
district
judge
howard
sachs
wrote
that
the
law's
various
sections
specifying
prohibitions
on
abortions
at
various
weeks
prior
to
viability
cannot
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect
on
august
as
scheduled
medical
professionals
generally
consider
babies
born
at
weeks
or
later
to
be
viable
although
babies
have
survived
and
thrived
after
being
born
as
early
as
weeks
and
days
according
to
the
ruling
about
half
the
reported
abortions
in
missouri
took
place
after
the
eighth
week
of
pregnancy
sachs
said
if
it
were
possible
to
sever
the
language
to
limit
the
preliminary
injunction
to
non-viable
fetuses
i
would
do
so
but
that
cannot
be
done
without
judicial
re-writing
of
the
section
a
practice
to
be
avoided
when
possible
does
this
sound
familiar
in
may
another
federal
judge
blocked
missouri
from
closing
its
last
planned
parenthood
location
the
state
had
decided
to
let
the
clinic's
license
expire
after
it
failed
to
agree
to
a
request
from
the
state
government
to
interview
its
seven
physicians
to
ensure
that
they
were
adhering
to
existing
legal
guidelines
