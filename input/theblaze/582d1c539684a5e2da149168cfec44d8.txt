iranian
president
backs
out
of
possible
meeting
with
president
trump
demands
sanctions
be
lifted
first
this
came
a
day
after
he
seemed
to
be
on
board
with
the
idea
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
tuesday
that
he
would
not
meet
with
the
president
donald
trump
unless
the
united
states
first
lifted
sanctions
it
had
put
in
place
on
the
iranian
regime
here's
what
we
knowon
monday
trump
floated
the
idea
of
meeting
with
rouhani
saying
that
there
was
a
really
good
chance
that
such
a
summit
could
happen
this
development
was
due
to
the
efforts
of
french
president
emmanuel
macron
who
has
been
pushing
for
more
dialogue
in
an
increasingly
tense
relationship
between
the
u.s.
and
iran
rouhani
said
monday
that
he
would
not
miss
a
chance
to
meet
even
if
the
odds
of
success
are
not
percent
but
are
percent
or
percent
but
by
tuesday
that
had
all
changed
in
a
televised
address
tuesday
rouhani
said
definitively
that
without
the
u.s.
s
withdrawal
from
sanctions
we
will
not
witness
any
positive
development
he
also
dismissed
the
meeting
trump
had
suggested
as
a
pr
move
by
the
united
states
adding
if
someone
intends
to
make
it
as
just
a
photo-op
then
that
is
not
possible
what
else
macron
has
also
been
trying
to
save
the
obama-era
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
commonly
known
as
the
iran
nuclear
deal
while
france
germany
and
the
united
kingdom
have
tried
to
keep
the
agreement
alive
trump
announced
in
may
that
the
u.s.
would
be
leaving
the
agreement
in
june
iran's
government
said
that
it
was
about
to
pass
the
nuclear
stockpile
limits
that
it
had
agreed
to
under
this
deal
