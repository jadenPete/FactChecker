to
the
los
angeles
times
the
hotline
was
run
by
an

called
freedom

fialho
said
their
organization
had
never
been
on
the
eoir
list
but
had
been
given
a
toll-free
extension
anyway
the
group
is
now
paying
several
thousand
dollars
a
month
to
offer
services
to
detainees
for
free
the
organization
has
sent
a
cease-and-desist
letter
to
ice
claiming
that
shutting
down
the
hotline
is
a
violation
of
free
speech
and
retaliation
against
criticism
even
a
freely
given
benefit
such
as
the
pro
bono
hotline
can't
be
taken
away
simply
because
the
government
is
now
unhappy
with
how
we
are
sharing
with
the
public
what
we
know
from
our
communications
with
people
inside
fialho
said
theblaze
has
reached
out
to
ice
for
clarification
on
this
situation
the
organization
has
not
yet
commented
publicly
on
the
hotline
or
potential
reasons
for
its
removal
