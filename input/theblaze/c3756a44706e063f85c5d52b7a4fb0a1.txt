christian
video
company
can't
be
forced
to
film
same-sex
weddings
appeals
court
rules
a
district
court
ruled
against
the
company
two
years
ago
a
federal
appeals
court
ruled
friday
that
a
christian
media
company
cannot
be
forced
to
produce
videos
for
same-sex
weddings
under
minnesota
state
law
according
to
the
christian
post
the
ruling
overturns
a
decision
by
a
district
court
that
said
telescope
media
group
owned
by
carl
and
angel
larsen
would
be
in
violation
of
the
minnesota
human
rights
act
by
refusing
to
provide
wedding
video
services
on
the
basis
of
customers
sexuality
judge
david
stras
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
th
district
wrote
in
the
court's
opinion
that
the
minnesota
law
violated
the
larsen's
free
speech
rights
indeed
if
minnesota
were
correct
there
is
no
reason
it
would
have
to
stop
with
the
larsens
stras
wrote
in
theory
it
could
use
the
mhra
to
require
a
muslim
tattoo
artist
to
inscribe
my
religion
is
the
only
true
religion
on
the
body
of
a
christian
if
he
or
she
would
do
the
same
for
a
fellow
muslim
or
it
could
demand
that
an
atheist
musician
perform
at
an
evangelical
church
service
the
district
court
also
ruled
that
the
larsens
could
not
seek
relief
on
various
other
constitutional
theories
we
largely
agree
that
these
claims
fail
but
one
the
free-exercise
claim
can
proceed
because
it
is
intertwined
with
their
free-speech
claim
the
larsens
were
represented
by
alliance
defending
freedom
the
district
court
had
ruled
that
telescope
media
group
refusing
to
offer
its
services
to
same-sex
couples
was
basically
the
same
as
posting
a
white
applicants
only
sign
in
the
dissenting
opinion
u.s.
district
court
judge
john
tunheim
wrote
that
there
were
other
options
for
the
larsens
besides
refusing
service
for
example
the
larsens
could
post
language
on
their
website
stating
that
while
they
follow
applicable
law
and
thus
serve
couples
regardless
of
protected
status
they
are
opposed
to
same-sex
marriage
