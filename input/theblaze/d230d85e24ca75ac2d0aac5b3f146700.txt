jesus
was
not
a
socialist
graham
allen
takes
on
latest
leftist
claim
it's
not
a
moral
code
it's
lies
in
a
recent
viral
video
on
twitter
the
rev
dr
william
barber
joined
the
growing
throng
of
leftists
who
claim
that
jesus
was
a
socialist
because
the
bible
promotes
charity
on
monday's
dear
america
host
graham
allen
argued
that
having
the
government
forcibly
take
and
reallocate
your
money
is
not
the
same
thing
as
charity
that's
not
charity
he
asserted
the
bible
talks
about
being
charitable
with
the
money
that
you
have
to
people
that
need
it
the
bible
doesn't
say
anything
about
your
money
being
taken
from
you
and
then
somebody
in
government
decides
what
charity
actually
is
that
is
the
exact
opposite
graham
added
that
prominent
democratic
leaders
such
as
presidential
candidates
sen
kamala
harris
calif
and
south
bend
indiana
mayor
pete
buttigieg
are
trying
to
convince
christians
to
embrace
socialism
by
taking
certain
scripture
about
being
charitable
and
giving
to
your
brother
out
of
context
they
use
that
as
a
justification
for
socialism
he
said
it's
not
a
moral
code
it's
lies
christians
are
so
afraid
of
offending
people
by
simple
stating
what
we
know
to
be
true
based
on
the
scripture
in
which
we
believe
because
if
you're
a
christian
that's
what
you
do
right
